They\r\nwere informal, indeed talkative, in their tone, and it seemed safer when\r\npresenting them in book form not to mitigate the talk, in case nothing\r\nshould be left at all. Words such as \"I,\" \"you,\" \"one,\" \"we,\" \"curiously\r\nenough,\" \"so to speak,\" \"only imagine,\" and \"of course\" will\r\nconsequently occur on every page and will rightly distress the sensitive\r\nreader; but he is asked to remember that if these words were removed\r\nothers, perhaps more distinguished, might escape through the orifices\r\nthey left, and that since the novel is itself often colloquial it may\r\npossibly withhold some of its secrets from the graver and grander\r\nstreams of criticism, and may reveal them to backwaters and shallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI    INTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nII   THE STORY\r\n\r\nIII  PEOPLE\r\n\r\nIV   PEOPLE (_continued_)\r\n\r\nV    THE PLOT\r\n\r\nVI   FANTASY\r\n\r\nVII  PROPHECY\r\n\r\nVIII PATTERN AND RHYTHM\r\n\r\nIX   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nINDEX OF MAIN REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPECTS OF THE NOVEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS lectureship is connected with the name of William George Clark, a\r\nfellow of Trinity. It is through him we meet today, and through him we\r\nshall approach our subject.\r\n\r\nClark was, I believe, a Yorkshireman. He was born in 1821, was at school\r\nat Sedbergh and Shrewsbury, entered Trinity as an undergraduate in 1840,\r\nbecame fellow four years later, and made the college his home for nearly\r\nthirty years, only leaving it when his health broke, shortly before his\r\ndeath. He is best known as a Shakespearian scholar, but he published two\r\nbooks on other subjects to which we must here refer. He went as a young\r\nman to Spain and wrote a pleasant lively account of his holiday called\r\n_Gazpacho_: Gazpacho being the name of a certain cold soup which he ate\r\nand appears to have enjoyed among the peasants of Andalusia: indeed he\r\nappears to have enjoyed everything. Eight years later, as a result of a\r\nholiday in Greece, he published a second book, _Peloponnesus_.\r\n_Peloponnesus_ is a graver work and a duller. Greece was a serious place\r\nin those days, more serious than Spain, besides, Clark had by now not\r\nonly taken Orders but become Public Orator, and he was, above all,\r\ntravelling with Dr. Thompson, the then Master of the college, who was\r\nnot at all the sort of person to be involved in a cold soup. The jests\r\nabout mules and fleas are consequently few, and we are increasingly\r\nconfronted with the remains of Classical Antiquity and the sites of\r\nbattles. What survives in the book--apart from its learning--is its\r\nfeeling for Greek country-side. Clark also travelled in Italy and\r\nPoland.\r\n\r\nTo turn to his academic career. He planned the great _Cambridge\r\nShakespeare_, first with Glover, then with Aldis Wright (both librarians\r\nof Trinity), and, helped by Aldis Wright, he issued the _Globe\r\nShakespeare_, a popular text. He collected much material for an edition\r\nof Aristophanes. He also published some Sermons, but in 1869 he gave up\r\nHoly Orders--which, by the way, will exempt us from excessive orthodoxy.\r\nLike his friend and biographer Leslie Stephen, like Henry Sidgwick and\r\nothers of that generation, he did not find it possible to remain in the\r\nChurch, and he has explained his reasons in a pamphlet entitled _The\r\nPresent Dangers of the Church of England_. He resigned his post of\r\nPublic Orator in consequence, while retaining his college tutorship. He\r\ndied at the age of fifty-seven, esteemed by all who knew him as a\r\nlovable, scholarly and honest man. You will have realized that he is a\r\nCambridge figure. Not a figure in the great world or even at Oxford, but\r\na spirit peculiar to these courts, which perhaps only you who tread them\r\nafter him can justly appreciate: the spirit of integrity. Out of a\r\nbequest in his will, his old college has provided for a series of\r\nlectures, to be delivered annually \"on some period or periods of English\r\nLiterature not earlier than Chaucer,\" and that is why we meet here now.\r\n\r\nInvocations are out of fashion, yet I wanted to make this small one, for\r\ntwo reasons. Firstly, may a little of Clark's integrity be with us\r\nthrough this course; and secondly, may he accord us a little\r\ninattention! For I am not keeping quite strictly to the terms laid\r\ndown--\"Period or periods of English Literature.\" This condition, though\r\nit sounds liberal and is liberal enough in spirit, happens verbally not\r\nquite to suit our subject, and I shall occupy the introductory lecture\r\nin explaining why this is. The points raised may seem trivial. But they\r\nwill lead us to a convenient vantage post from which we can begin our\r\nmain attack next week.\r\n\r\nWe need a vantage post, for the novel is a formidable mass, and it is so\r\namorphous--no mountain in it to climb, no Parnassus or Helicon, not even\r\na Pisgah. It is most distinctly one of the moister areas of\r\nliterature--irrigated by a hundred rills and occasionally degenerating\r\ninto a swamp. I do not wonder that the poets despise it, though they\r\nsometimes find themselves in it by accident. And I am not surprised at\r\nthe annoyance of the historians when by accident it finds itself among\r\nthem. Perhaps we ought to define what a novel is before starting. This\r\nwill not take a second. M. Abel Chevalley has, in his brilliant little\r\nmanual,[1] provided a definition, and if a French critic cannot define\r\nthe English novel, who can? It is, he says, \"a fiction in prose of a\r\ncertain extent\" (une fiction en prose d'une certaine étendue). That is\r\nquite good enough for us, and we may perhaps go so far as to add that\r\nthe extent should not be less than 50,000 words. Any fictitious prose\r\nwork over 50,000 words will be a novel for the purposes of these\r\nlectures, and if this seems to you unphilosophic will you think of an\r\nalternative definition, which will include _The Pilgrim's Progress_,\r\n_Marius the Epicurean_, _The Adventures of a Younger Son_, _The Magic\r\nFlute_, _The Journal of the Plague_, _Zuleika Dobson_, _Rasselas_,\r\n_Ulysses_, and _Green Mansions_, or else will give reasons for their\r\nexclusion? Parts of our spongy tract seem more fictitious than other\r\nparts, it is true: near the middle, on a tump of grass, stand Miss\r\nAusten with the figure of Emma by her side, and Thackeray holding up\r\nEsmond. But no intelligent remark known to me will define the tract as a\r\nwhole. All we can say of it is that it is bounded by two chains of\r\nmountains neither of which rises very abruptly--the opposing ranges of\r\nPoetry and of History--and bounded on the third side by a sea--a sea\r\nthat we shall encounter when we come to _Moby Dick_.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by considering the proviso \"English Literature.\" \"English\"\r\nwe shall of course interpret as written in English, not as published\r\nsouth of the Tweed or east of the Atlantic, or north of the Equator: we\r\nneed not attend to geographical accidents, they can be left to the\r\npoliticians. Yet, even with this interpretation, are we as free as we\r\nwish? Can we, while discussing English fiction, quite ignore fiction\r\nwritten in other languages, particularly French and Russian? As far as\r\ninfluence goes, we could ignore it, for our writers have never been much\r\ninfluenced by the continentals. But--for reasons soon to be explained--I\r\nwant to talk as little as possible about influence during these\r\nlectures. My subject is a particular kind of book and the aspects that\r\nbook has assumed in English. Can we ignore its collateral aspects on the\r\ncontinent? Not entirely. An unpleasant and unpatriotic truth has here to\r\nbe faced. No English novelist is as great as Tolstoy--that is to say has\r\ngiven so complete a picture of man's life, both on its domestic and\r\nheroic side. No English novelist has explored man's soul as deeply as\r\nDostoevsky. And no novelist anywhere has analysed the modern\r\nconsciousness as successfully as Marcel Proust. Before these triumphs we\r\nmust pause. English poetry fears no one--excels in quality as well as\r\nquantity. But English Action is less triumphant: it does not contain the\r\nbest stuff yet written, and if we deny this we become guilty of\r\nprovincialism.\r\n\r\nNow, provincialism does not signify in a writer, and may indeed be the\r\nchief source of his strength: only a prig or a fool would complain that\r\nDefoe is cockneyfied or Thomas Hardy countrified. But provincialism in a\r\ncritic is a serious fault. A critic has no right to the narrowness which\r\nis the frequent prerogative of the creative artist. He has to have a\r\nwide outlook or he has not anything at all. Although the novel exercises\r\nthe rights of a created object, criticism has not those rights, and too\r\nmany little mansions in English fiction have been acclaimed to their own\r\ndetriment as important edifices. Take four at random: _Cranford_, _The\r\nHeart of Midlothian_, _Jane Eyre_, _Richard Feverel_. For various\r\npersonal and local reasons we may be attached to these four books.\r\n_Cranford_ radiates the humour of the urban midlands, _Midlothian_ is a\r\nhandful out of Edinburgh, _Jane Eyre_ is the passionate dream of a fine\r\nbut still undeveloped woman. _Richard Feverel_ exudes farmhouse lyricism\r\nand flickers with modish wit, but all four are little mansions, not\r\nmighty edifices, and we shall see and respect them for what they are if\r\nwe stand them for an instant in the colonnades of _War and Peace_, or\r\nthe vaults of _The Brothers Karamazov_.\r\n\r\nI shall not often refer to foreign novels in these lectures, still less\r\nwould I pose as an expert on them who is debarred from discussing them\r\nby his terms of reference. But I do want to emphasize their greatness\r\nbefore we start; to cast, so to speak, this preliminary shadow over our\r\nsubject, so that when we look back on it at the end we may have the\r\nbetter chance of seeing it in its true lights.\r\n\r\nSo much for the proviso \"English.\" Now for a more important proviso,\r\nthat of \"period or periods.\" This idea of a period of a development in\r\ntime, with its consequent emphasis on influences and schools, happens to\r\nbe exactly what I am hoping to avoid during our brief survey, and I\r\nbelieve that the author of _Gazpacho_ will be lenient. Time, all the way\r\nthrough, is to be our enemy. We are to visualize the English novelists\r\nnot as floating down that stream which bears all its sons away unless\r\nthey are careful, but as seated together in a room, a circular room, a\r\nsort of British Museum reading-room--all writing their novels\r\nsimultaneously. They do not, as they sit there, think \"I live under\r\nQueen Victoria, I under Anne, I carry on the tradition of Trollope, I am\r\nreacting against Aldous Huxley.\" The fact that their pens are in their\r\nhands is far more vivid to them. They are half mesmerized, their sorrows\r\nand joys are pouring out through the ink, they are approximated by the\r\nact of creation, and when Professor Oliver Elton says, as he does, that\r\n\"after 1847 the novel of passion was never to be the same again,\" none\r\nof them understand what he means. That is to be our vision of them--an\r\nimperfect vision, but it is suited to our powers, it will preserve us\r\nfrom a serious danger, the danger of pseudo-scholarship.\r\n\r\nGenuine scholarship is one of the highest successes which our race can\r\nachieve. No one is more triumphant than the man who chooses a worthy\r\nsubject and masters all its facts and the leading facts of the subjects\r\nneighbouring. He can then do what he likes. He can, if his subject is\r\nthe novel, lecture on it chronologically if he wishes because he has\r\nread all the important novels of the past four centuries, many of the\r\nunimportant ones, and has adequate knowledge of any collateral facts\r\nthat bear upon English fiction. The late Sir Walter Raleigh (who once\r\nheld this lectureship) was such a scholar. Raleigh knew so many facts\r\nthat he was able to proceed to influences, and his monograph on the\r\nEnglish novel adopts the treatment by period which his unworthy\r\nsuccessor must avoid. The scholar, like the philosopher, can contemplate\r\nthe river of time. He contemplates it not as a whole, but he can see the\r\nfacts, the personalities, floating past him, and estimate the relations\r\nbetween them, and if his conclusions could be as valuable to us as they\r\nare to himself he would long ago have civilized the human race. As you\r\nknow, he has failed. True scholarship is incommunicable, true scholars\r\nrare. There are a few scholars, actual or potential, in the audience\r\ntoday, but only a few, and there is certainly none on the platform. Most\r\nof us are pseudo-scholars, and I want to consider our characteristics\r\nwith sympathy and respect, for we are a very large and quite a powerful\r\nclass, eminent in Church and State, we control the education of the\r\nEmpire, we lend to the Press such distinction as it consents to receive,\r\nand we are a welcome asset at dinner-parties.\r\n\r\nPseudo-scholarship is, on its good side, the homage paid by ignorance to\r\nlearning. It also has an economic side, on which we need not be hard.\r\nMost of us must get a job before thirty, or sponge on our relatives, and\r\nmany jobs can only be got by passing an exam. The pseudo-scholar often\r\ndoes well in examination (real scholars are not much good), and even\r\nwhen he fails he appreciates their innate majesty. They are gateways to\r\nemployment, they have power to ban and bless. A paper on _King Lear_ may\r\nlead somewhere, unlike the rather far-fetched play of the same name. It\r\nmay be a stepping-stone to the Local Government Board. He does not often\r\nput it to himself openly and say \"That's the use of knowing things, they\r\nhelp you to get on.\" The economic pressure he feels is more often\r\nsubconscious, and he goes to his exam, merely feeling that a paper on\r\nKing Lear is a very tempestuous and terrible experience but an intensely\r\nreal one. And whether he be cynical or naïf, he is not to be blamed. As\r\nlong as learning is connected with earning, as long as certain jobs can\r\nonly be reached through exams, so long must we take the examination\r\nsystem seriously. If another ladder to employment was contrived, much\r\nso-called education would disappear, and no one be a penny the stupider.\r\n\r\nIt is when he comes to criticism--to a job like the present--that he can\r\nbe so pernicious, because he follows the method of a true scholar\r\nwithout having his equipment. He classes books before he has understood\r\nor read them; that is his first crime. Classification by chronology.\r\nBooks written before 1847, books written after it, books written after\r\nor before 1848. The novel in the reign of Queen Anne, the pre-novel, the\r\nur-novel, the novel of the future. Classification by subject\r\nmatter--sillier still. The literature of Inns, beginning with _Tom\r\nJones_; the literature of the Women's Movement, beginning with\r\n_Shirley_; the literature of Desert Islands, from _Robinson Crusoe_ to\r\n_The Blue Lagoon_; the literature of Rogues--dreariest of all, though\r\nthe Open Road runs it pretty close; the literature of Sussex (perhaps\r\nthe most devoted of the Home Counties); improper books--a serious though\r\ndreadful branch of enquiry, only to be pursued by pseudo-scholars of\r\nriper years, novels relating to industrialism, aviation, chiropody, the\r\nweather. I include the weather on the authority of the most amazing work\r\non the novel that I have met for many years. It came over the Atlantic\r\nto me, nor shall I ever forget it. It was a literary manual entitled\r\n_Materials and Methods of Fiction_. The writer's name shall be\r\nconcealed. He was a pseudo-scholar and a good one. He classified novels\r\nby their dates, their length, their locality, their sex, their point of\r\nview, till no more seemed possible. But he still had the weather up his\r\nsleeve, and when he brought it out, it had nine heads. He gave an\r\nexample under each head, for he was anything but slovenly, and we will\r\nrun through his list. In the first place the weather can be\r\n\"decorative,\" as in Pierre Loti; then \"utilitarian,\" as in _The Mill on\r\nthe Floss_ (no Floss, no Mill; no Mill, no Tullivers); \"illustrative,\"\r\nas in _The Egoist_; \"planned in pre-established harmony,\" as by Fiona\r\nMacLeod; \"in emotional contrast,\" as in _The Master of Ballantrae_;\r\n\"determinative of action,\" as in a certain Kipling story, where a man\r\nproposes to the wrong girl on account of a mud storm; \"a controlling\r\ninfluence,\" _Richard Feverel_; \"itself a hero,\" like Vesuvius in _The\r\nDays of Pompeii_; and ninethly, it can be \"non-existent,\" as in a\r\nnursery tale. I liked him flinging in non-existence. It made everything\r\nso scientific and trim. But he himself remained a little dissatisfied,\r\nand having finished his classification he said yes, of course there was\r\none more thing, and that was genius; it was useless for a novelist to\r\nknow that there are nine sorts of weather, unless he has genius also.\r\nCheered by this reflection, he classified novels by their tones. There\r\nare only two tones, personal and impersonal, and having given examples\r\nof each he grew pensive again and said, \"Yes, but you must have genius\r\ntoo, or neither tone will profit.\"\r\n\r\nThis constant reference to genius is another characteristic of the\r\npseudo-scholar. He loves mentioning genius, because the sound of the\r\nword exempts him from trying to discover its meaning. Literature is\r\nwritten by geniuses. Novelists are geniuses. There we are; now let us\r\nclassify them. Which he does. Everything he says may be accurate but all\r\nis useless because he is moving round books instead of through them, he\r\neither has not read them or cannot read them properly. Books have to be\r\nread (worse luck, for it takes a long time); it is the only way of\r\ndiscovering what they contain. A few savage tribes eat them, but reading\r\nis the only method of assimilation revealed to the west. The reader must\r\nsit down alone and struggle with the writer, and this the pseudo-scholar\r\nwill not do. He would rather relate a book to the history of its time,\r\nto events in the life of its author, to the events it describes, above\r\nall to some tendency. As soon as he can use the word \"tendency\" his\r\nspirits rise, and though those of his audience may sink, they often pull\r\nout their pencils at this point and make a note, under the belief that a\r\ntendency is portable.\r\n\r\nThat is why, in the rather ramshackly course that lies ahead of us, we\r\ncannot consider fiction by periods, we must not contemplate the stream\r\nof time. Another image better suits our powers: that of all the\r\nnovelists writing their novels at once. They come from different ages\r\nand ranks, they have different temperaments and aims, but they all hold\r\npens in their hands, and are in the process of creation. Let us look\r\nover their shoulders for a moment and see what they are writing. It may\r\nexorcise that demon of chronology which is at present our enemy and\r\nwhich (we shall discover next week) is sometimes their enemy too. \"Oh,\r\nwhat quenchless feud is this, that Time hath with the sons of men,\"\r\ncries Herman Melville, and the feud goes on not only in life and death\r\nbut in the by-ways of literary creation and criticism. Let us avoid it\r\nby imagining that all the novelists are at work together in a circular\r\nroom. I shall not mention their names until we have heard their words,\r\nbecause a name brings associations with it, dates, gossip, all the\r\nfurniture of the method we are discarding.\r\n\r\nThey have been instructed to group themselves in pairs. We approach the\r\nfirst pair, and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\ni. I don't know what to do--not I. God forgive me, but I am very\r\nimpatient! I wish--but I don't know what to wish without a sin. Yet I\r\nwish it would please God to take me to his mercy!--I can meet with none\r\nhere.--What a world is this!--What is there in it desirable? The good we\r\nhope for so strangely mixed, that one knows not what to wish for! And\r\none half of mankind tormenting the other and being tormented themselves\r\nin tormenting.\r\n\r\nii. What I hate is myself--when I think that one has to take so much, to\r\nbe happy, out of the lives of others, and that one isn't happy even\r\nthen. One does it to cheat one's self and to stop one's mouth--but that\r\nis only, at the best, for a little. The wretched self is always there,\r\nalways making us somehow a fresh anxiety. What it comes to is that it's\r\nnot, that it's never, a happiness, any happiness at all, to _take_. The\r\nonly safe thing is to give. It's what plays you least false.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that here sit two novelists who are looking at life from\r\nmuch the same angle, yet the first of them is Samuel Richardson, and the\r\nsecond you will have already identified as Henry James. Each is an\r\nanxious rather than an ardent psychologist. Each is sensitive to\r\nsuffering and appreciates self-sacrifice; each falls short of the\r\ntragic, though a close approach is made. A sort of tremulous\r\nnobility--that is the spirit that dominates them--and oh how well they\r\nwrite!--not a word out of place in their copious flows. A hundred and\r\nfifty years of time divide them, but are not they close together in other\r\nways, and may not their neighbourliness profit us? Of course as I say\r\nthis I hear Henry James beginning to express his regret--no, not his\r\nregret but his surprise--no, not even his surprise but his awareness\r\nthat neighbourliness is being postulated of him, and postulated, must he\r\nadd, in relation to a shopkeeper. And I hear Richardson, equally\r\ncautious, wondering whether any writer born outside England can be\r\nchaste. But these are surface differences, are indeed no differences at\r\nall, but additional points of contact. We leave them sitting in harmony,\r\nand proceed to our next pair.\r\n\r\n\r\ni. All the preparations for the funeral ran easily and happily under\r\nMrs. Johnson's skilful hands. On the eve of the sad occasion she\r\nproduced a reserve of black sateen, the kitchen steps, and a box of\r\ntintacks, and decorated the house with festoons and bows of black in the\r\nbest possible taste. She tied up the knocker with black crêpe, and put\r\na large bow over the corner of the steel engraving of Garibaldi, and\r\nswathed the bust of Mr. Gladstone that had belonged to the deceased with\r\ninky swathings. She turned the two vases that had views of Tivoli and\r\nthe Bay of Naples round, so that these rather brilliant landscapes were\r\nhidden and only the plain blue enamel showed, and she anticipated the\r\nlong contemplated purchase of a tablecloth for the front room, and\r\nsubstituted a violet purple cover for the now very worn and faded\r\nraptures and roses in plushette that had hitherto done duty there.\r\nEverything that loving consideration could do to impart a dignified\r\nsolemnity to her little home was done.\r\n\r\nii. The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet cake, I\r\nlooked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible\r\nuntil one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum\r\ncake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and\r\nbiscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had\r\nnever seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.\r\nStanding at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in\r\na black cloak and several yards of hat-band, who was alternately\r\nstuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention.\r\nThe moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and\r\ncrumbs) and said in a subdued voice, \"May I, dear sir?\" and did.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two funerals did not by any means happen on the same day. One is\r\nthe funeral of Mr. Polly's father (1920), the other the funeral of Mrs.\r\nGargery in _Great Expectations_ (1860). Yet Wells and Dickens are\r\ndescribing them from the same point of view and even using the same\r\ntricks of style (cf. the two vases and the two decanters). They are,\r\nboth, humorists and visualizers who get an effect by cataloguing details\r\nand whisking the page over irritably. They are generous-minded; they\r\nhate shams and enjoy being indignant about them; they are valuable\r\nsocial reformers; they have no notion of confining books to a library\r\nshelf. Sometimes the lively surface of their prose scratches like a\r\ncheap gramophone record, a certain poorness of quality appears, and the\r\nface of the author draws rather too near to that of the reader. In other\r\nwords, neither of them has much taste: the world of beauty was largely\r\nclosed to Dickens, and is entirely closed to Wells. And there are other\r\nparallels--for instance their method of drawing character, but that we\r\nshall examine later on. And perhaps the great difference between them is\r\nthe difference of opportunity offered to an obscure boy of genius a\r\nhundred years ago and to a similar boy forty years ago. The difference\r\nis all in Wells' favour. He is far better educated than his predecessor;\r\nin particular the addition of science has strengthened his mind out of\r\nrecognition and subdued his hysteria. He registers an improvement in\r\nsociety: Dotheboys Hall has been superseded by the Polytechnic. But he\r\ndoes not register any change in the novelist's art.\r\n\r\nWhat about our next pair?\r\n\r\n\r\ni. But as for that mark, I'm not sure about it; I don't believe it was\r\nmade by a nail after all; it's too big, too round, for that I might get\r\nup, but if I got up and looked at it, ten to one I shouldn't be able to\r\nsay for certain; because once a thing's done, no one ever knows how it\r\nhappened. O dear me, the mystery of life! The inaccuracy of thought! The\r\nignorance of humanity! To show how very little control of our\r\npossessions we have--what an accidental affair this living is after all\r\nour civilization--let me just count over a few of the things lost on one\r\nlifetime, beginning, for that always seems the most mysterious of\r\nlosses--what cat would gnaw, what rat would nibble--three pale blue\r\ncanisters of bookbinding tools? Then there were the birdcages, the iron\r\nhoops, the steel skates, the Queen Anne coal-scuttle, the\r\nbagatelle-board, the hand-organ--all gone, and jewels too. Opals and\r\nemeralds, they lie about the roots of turnips. What a scraping paring\r\naffair it is to be sure! The wonder is that I've any clothes on my back,\r\nthat I sit surrounded by solid furniture at this moment. Why, if one\r\nwants to compare life to anything one must liken it to being blown\r\nthrough the Tube at fifty miles an hour....\r\n\r\nii. Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to\r\nhave it mended; 'tis not mended yet. No family but ours would have borne\r\nwith it an hour, and what is most astonishing, there was not a subject\r\nin the world upon which my father was so eloquent as upon that of\r\ndoor-hinges. And yet, at the same time, he was certainly one of the\r\ngreatest bubbles to them, I think, that history can produce; his\r\nrhetoric and conduct were at perpetual handy-cuffs. Never did the\r\nparlour door open but his philosophy or his principles fell a victim to\r\nit; three drops of oil with a feather, and a smart stroke of a hammer,\r\nhad saved his honour for ever.\r\n\r\nInconsistent soul that man is; languishing under wounds which he has the\r\npower to heal; his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge; his\r\nreason, that precious gift of God to him (instead of pouring in oil),\r\nserving but to sharpen his sensibilities, to multiply his pains, and\r\nrender him more melancholy and uneasy under them! Poor unhappy creature,\r\nthat he should do so! Are not the necessary causes of misery in this\r\nlife enough, but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow?\r\nStruggle against evils which cannot be avoided, and submit to others\r\nwhich a tenth part of the trouble they create him would remove from his\r\nheart for ever.\r\n\r\nBy all that is good and virtuous, if there are three drops of oil to be\r\ngot and a hammer to be found within ten miles of Shandy Hall, the\r\nparlour door hinge shall be mended this reign.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage last quoted is, of course, out of _Tristram Shandy_. The\r\nother passage was from Virginia Woolf. She and Sterne are both\r\nfantasists. They start with a little object, take a flutter from it, and\r\nsettle on it again. They combine a humorous appreciation of the muddle\r\nof life with a keen sense of its beauty. There is even the same tone in\r\ntheir voices--a rather deliberate bewilderment, an announcement to all\r\nand sundry that they do not know where they are going. No doubt their\r\nscales of value are not the same. Sterne is a sentimentalist, Virginia\r\nWoolf (except perhaps in her latest work, _To the Lighthouse_) is\r\nextremely aloof. Nor are their achievements on the same scale. But their\r\nmedium is similar, the same odd effects are obtained by it, the parlour\r\ndoor is never mended, the mark on the wall turns out to be a snail, life\r\nis such a muddle, oh, dear, the will is so weak, the sensations\r\nfidgety--philosophy--God--oh, dear, look at the mark--listen to the\r\ndoor--existence is really too ... what were we saying?\r\n\r\nDoes not chronology seem less important now that we have visualized six\r\nnovelists at their jobs? If the novel develops, is it not likely to\r\ndevelop on different lines from the British Constitution, or even the\r\nWomen's Movement? I say \"even the Women's Movement\" because there\r\nhappened to be a close association between fiction in England and that\r\nmovement during the nineteenth century--a connection so close that it\r\nhas misled some critics into thinking it an organic connection. As women\r\nbettered their position the novel, they asserted, became better too.\r\nQuite wrong. A mirror does not develop because an historical pageant\r\npasses in front of it. It only develops when it gets a fresh coat of\r\nquicksilver--in other words, when it acquires new sensitiveness; and the\r\nnovel's success lies in its own sensitiveness, not in the success of its\r\nsubject matter. Empires fall, votes are accorded, but to those people\r\nwriting in the circular room it is the feel of the pen between their\r\nfingers that matters most. They may decide to write a novel upon the\r\nFrench or the Russian Revolution, but memories, associations, passions,\r\nrise up and cloud their objectivity, so that at the close, when they\r\nre-read, some one else seems to have been holding their pen and to have\r\nrelegated their theme to the background. That \"some one else\" is their\r\nself no doubt, but not the self that is so active in time and lives\r\nunder George IV or V. All through history writers while writing have\r\nfelt more or less the same. They have entered a common state which it is\r\nconvenient to call inspiration,[2] and having regard to that state, we\r\nmay say that History develops, Art stands still.\r\n\r\nHistory develops, Art stands still, is a crude motto, indeed it is\r\nalmost a slogan, and though forced to adopt it we must not do so without\r\nadmitting it vulgarily. It contains only a partial truth.\r\n\r\nIt debars us in the first place from considering whether the human mind\r\nalters from generation to generation; whether, for instance, Thomas\r\nDeloney, who wrote humorously about shops and pubs in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, differs fundamentally from his modern representative--who\r\nwould be some one of the calibre of Neil Lyons or Pett Ridge. As a\r\nmatter of fact Deloney did not differ; differed as an individual, but\r\nnot fundamentally, not because he lived four hundred years ago. Four\r\nthousand, fourteen thousand years might give us pause, but four hundred\r\nyears is nothing in the life of our race, and does not allow room for\r\nany measurable change. So our slogan here is no practical hindrance. We\r\ncan chant it without shame.\r\n\r\nIt is more serious when we turn to the development of tradition and see\r\nwhat we lose through being debarred from examining that. Apart from\r\nschools and influences and fashions, there has been a technique in\r\nEnglish fiction, and this does alter from generation to generation. The\r\ntechnique of laughing at characters for instance: to smoke and to rag\r\nare not identical; the Elizabethan humorist picks up his victim in a\r\ndifferent way from the modern, raises his laugh by other tricks. Or the\r\ntechnique of fantasy: Virginia Woolf, though her aim and general effect\r\nboth resemble Sterne's, differs from him in execution; she belongs to\r\nthe same tradition but to a later phase of it. Or the technique of\r\nconversation: in my pairs of examples I could not include a couple of\r\ndialogues, though I wanted to, for the reason that the use of the \"he\r\nsaid\" and \"she said\" varies so much through the centuries that it\r\ncolours its surroundings, and though the speakers may be similarly\r\nconceived they will not seem so in an extract. Well, we cannot examine\r\nquestions like these, and must admit we are the poorer, though we can\r\nabandon the development of subject matter and the development of the\r\nhuman race without regret. Literary tradition is the borderland lying\r\nbetween literature and history, and the well-equipped critic will spend\r\nmuch time there and enrich his judgment accordingly. We cannot go there\r\nbecause we have not read enough. We must pretend it belongs to history\r\nand cut it off accordingly. We must refuse to have anything to do with\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nLet me quote here for our comfort from my immediate predecessor in this\r\nlectureship, Mr. T. S. Eliot. Mr. Eliot enumerates, in the introduction\r\nto _The Sacred Wood_, the duties of the critic. \"It is part of his\r\nbusiness to preserve tradition--when a good tradition exists. It is part\r\nof his business to see literature steadily and to see it whole; and this\r\nis eminently to see it not as consecrated by time, but to see it beyond\r\ntime.\" The first duty we cannot perform, the second we must try to\r\nperform. We can neither examine nor preserve tradition. But we can\r\nvisualize the novelists as sitting in one room, and force them, by our\r\nvery ignorance, from the limitations of date and place. I think that is\r\nworth doing, or I should not have ventured to undertake this course.\r\n\r\nHow then are we to attack the novel--that spongy tract, those fictions\r\nin prose of a certain extent which extend so indeterminately? Not with\r\nany elaborate apparatus. Principles and systems may suit other forms of\r\nart, but they cannot be applicable here--or if applied their results\r\nmust be subjected to re-examination. And who is the re-examiner? Well, I\r\nam afraid it will be the human heart, it will be this man-to-man\r\nbusiness, justly suspect in its cruder forms. The final test of a novel\r\nwill be our affection for it, as it is the test of our friends, and of\r\nanything else which we cannot define. Sentimentality--to some a worse\r\ndemon than chronology--will lurk in the background saying, \"Oh, but I\r\nlike that,\" \"Oh, but that doesn't appeal to me,\" and all I can promise\r\nis that sentimentality shall not speak too loudly or too soon. The\r\nintensely, stiflingly human quality of the novel is not to be avoided;\r\nthe novel is sogged with humanity; there is no escaping the uplift or\r\nthe downpour, nor can they be kept out of criticism. We may hate\r\nhumanity, but if it is exorcised or even purified the novel wilts,\r\nlittle is left but a bunch of words.\r\n\r\nAnd I have chosen the title \"Aspects\" because it is unscientific and\r\nvague, because it leaves us the maximum of freedom, because it means\r\nboth the different ways we can look at a novel and the different ways a\r\nnovelist can look at his work. And the aspects selected for discussion\r\nare seven in number: The Story; People; The Plot; Fantasy; Prophecy;\r\nPattern and Rhythm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Le Roman Anglais de Notre Temps_. By Abel Chevalley,\r\n(Oxford University Press, New York.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I have touched on this theory of inspiration in a short essay\r\ncalled \"Anonymity.\" (Hogarth Press, London.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWE shall all agree that the fundamental aspect of the novel is its\r\nstory-telling aspect, but we shall voice our assent in different tones,\r\nand it is on the precise tone of voice we employ now that our subsequent\r\nconclusions will depend.\r\n\r\nLet us listen to three voices. If you ask one type of man, \"What does a\r\nnovel do?\" he will reply placidly: \"Well--I don't know--it seems a funny\r\nsort of question to ask--a novel's a novel--well, I don't know--I\r\nsuppose it kind of tells a story, so to speak.\" He is quite\r\ngood-tempered and vague, and probably driving a motor-bus at the same\r\ntime and paying no more attention to literature than it merits. Another\r\nman, whom I visualize as on a golf-course, will be aggressive and brisk.\r\nHe will reply: \"What does a novel do? Why, tell a story of course, and\r\nI've no use for it if it didn't. I like a story. Very bad taste on my\r\npart, no doubt, but I like a story. You can take your art, you can take\r\nyour literature, you can take your music, but give me a good story. And\r\nI like a story to be a story, mind, and my wife's the same.\" And a third\r\nman he says in a sort of drooping regretful voice, \"Yes--oh, dear,\r\nyes--the novel tells a story.\" I respect and admire the first speaker. I\r\ndetest and fear the second. And the third is myself. Yes--oh, dear,\r\nyes—the novel tells a story. That is the fundamental aspect without\r\nwhich it could not exist. That is the highest factor common to all\r\nnovels, and I wish that it was not so, that it could be something\r\ndifferent--melody, or perception of the truth, not this low atavistic\r\nform.\r\n\r\nFor the more we look at the story (the story that is a story, mind), the\r\nmore we disentangle it from the finer growths that it supports, the less\r\nshall we find to admire. It runs like a backbone--or may I say a\r\ntape-worm, for its beginning and end are arbitrary. It is immensely\r\nold--goes back to neolithic times, perhaps to palæolithic. Neanderthal\r\nman listened to stories, if one may judge by the shape of his skull. The\r\nprimitive audience was an audience of shock-heads, gaping round the\r\ncamp-fire, fatigued with contending against the mammoth or the woolly\r\nrhinoceros, and only kept awake by suspense. What would happen next? The\r\nnovelist droned on, and as soon as the audience guessed what happened\r\nnext, they either fell asleep or killed him. We can estimate the dangers\r\nincurred when we think of the career of Scheherazade in somewhat later\r\ntimes. Scheherazade avoided her fate because she knew how to wield the\r\nweapon of suspense--the only literary tool that has any effect upon\r\ntyrants and savages. Great novelist though she was,--exquisite in her\r\ndescriptions, tolerant in her judgments, ingenious in her incidents,\r\nadvanced in her morality, vivid in her delineations of character, expert\r\nin her knowledge of three Oriental capitals--it was yet on none of these\r\ngifts that she relied when trying to save her life from her intolerable\r\nhusband. They were but incidental. She only survived because she managed\r\nto keep the king wondering what would happen next. Each time she saw the\r\nsun rising she stopped in the middle of a sentence, and left him gaping.\r\n\"At this moment Scheherazade saw the morning appearing and, discreet,\r\nwas silent.\" This uninteresting little phrase is the backbone of the\r\n_One Thousand and One Nights_, the tape-worm by which they are tied\r\ntogether and the life of a most accomplished princess was preserved.\r\n\r\nWe are all like Scheherazade's husband, in that we want to know what\r\nhappens next. That is universal and that is why the backbone of a novel\r\nhas to be a story. Some of us want to know nothing else--there is\r\nnothing in us but primeval curiosity, and consequently our other\r\nliterary judgments are ludicrous. And now the story can be defined. It\r\nis a narrative of events arranged in their time sequence--dinner coming\r\nafter breakfast, Tuesday after Monday, decay after death, and so on. Qua\r\nstory, it can only have one merit: that of making the audience want to\r\nknow what happens next. And conversely it can only have one fault: that\r\nof making the audience not want to know what happens next. These are the\r\nonly two criticisms that can be made on the story that is a story. It is\r\nthe lowest and simplest of literary organisms. Yet it is the highest\r\nfactor common to all the very complicated organisms known as novels.\r\n\r\nWhen we isolate the story like this from the nobler aspects through\r\nwhich it moves, and hold it out on the forceps--wriggling and\r\ninterminable, the naked worm of time--it presents an appearance that is\r\nboth unlovely and dull. But we have much to learn from it. Let us begin\r\nby considering it in connection with daily life.\r\n\r\nDaily life is also full of the time-sense. We think one event occurs\r\nafter or before another, the thought is often in our minds, and much of\r\nour talk and action proceeds on the assumption. Much of our talk and\r\naction, but not all; there seems something else in life besides time,\r\nsomething which may conveniently be called \"value,\" something which is\r\nmeasured not by minutes or hours, but by intensity, so that when we look\r\nat our past it does not stretch back evenly but piles up into a few\r\nnotable pinnacles, and when we look at the future it seems sometimes a\r\nwall, sometimes a cloud, sometimes a sun, but never a chronological\r\nchart. Neither memory nor anticipation is much interested in Father\r\nTime, and all dreamers, artists and lovers are partially delivered from\r\nhis tyranny; he can kill them, but he cannot secure their attention, and\r\nat the very moment of doom, when the dock collected in the tower its\r\nstrength and struck, they may be looking the other way. So daily life,\r\nwhatever it may be really, is practically composed of two lives--the\r\nlife in time and the life by values--and our conduct reveals a double\r\nallegiance. \"I only saw her for five minutes, but it was worth it.\"\r\nThere you have both allegiances in a single sentence. And what the story\r\ndoes is to narrate the life in time. And what the entire novel does--if\r\nit is a good novel--is to include the life by values as well; using\r\ndevices hereafter to be examined. It, also, pays a double allegiance.\r\nBut in it, in the novel, the allegiance to time is imperative: no novel\r\ncould be written without it. Whereas in daily life the allegiance may\r\nnot be necessary: we do not know, and the experience of certain mystics\r\nsuggests, indeed, that it is not necessary, and that we are quite\r\nmistaken in supposing that Monday is followed by Tuesday, or death by\r\ndecay. It is always possible for you or me in daily life to deny that\r\ntime exists and act accordingly even if we become unintelligible and are\r\nsent by our fellow citizens to what they choose to call a lunatic\r\nasylum. But it is never possible for a novelist to deny time inside the\r\nfabric of his novel: he must cling however lightly to the thread of his\r\nstory, he must touch the interminable tapeworm, otherwise he becomes\r\nunintelligible, which, in his case, is a blunder.\r\n\r\nI am trying not to be philosophic about time, for it is (experts assure\r\nus) a most dangerous hobby for an outsider, far more fatal than place;\r\nand quite eminent metaphysicians have been dethroned through referring\r\nto it improperly. I am only trying to explain that as I lecture now I\r\nhear that clock ticking or do not hear it ticking, I retain or lose\r\nthe time sense; whereas in a novel there is always a clock. The author\r\nmay dislike his clock. Emily Brontë in _Wuthering Heights_ tried to\r\nhide hers. Sterne, in _Tristram Shandy_, turned his upside down. Marcel\r\nProust, still more ingenious, kept altering the hands, so that his hero\r\nwas at the same period entertaining a mistress to supper and playing\r\nball with his nurse in the park. All these devices are legitimate, but\r\nnone of them contravene our thesis: the basis of a novel is a story, and\r\na story is a narrative of events arranged in time sequence. (A story, by\r\nthe way, is not the same as a plot. It may form the basis of one, but\r\nthe plot is an organism of a higher type, and will be defined and\r\ndiscussed in a future lecture.)\r\n\r\nWho shall tell us a story?\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott of course.\r\n\r\nScott is a novelist over whom we shall violently divide. For my own part\r\nI do not care for him, and find it difficult to understand his continued\r\nreputation. His reputation in his day--that is easy to understand. There\r\nare important historical reasons for it, which we should discuss if our\r\nscheme was chronological. But when we fish him out of the river of time\r\nand set him to write in that circular room with the other novelists, he\r\npresents a less impressive figure. He is seen to have a trivial mind and\r\na heavy style. He cannot construct. He has neither artistic detachment\r\nnor passion, and how can a writer who is devoid of both, create\r\ncharacters who will move us deeply? Artistic detachment--perhaps it is\r\npriggish to ask for that. But passion--surely passion is low brow\r\nenough, and think how all Scott's laborious mountains and scooped-out\r\nglens and carefully ruined abbeys call out for passion, passion and how\r\nit is never there! If he had passion he would be a great writer--no\r\namount of clumsiness or artificiality would matter then. But he only has\r\na temperate heart and gentlemanly feelings, and an intelligent affection\r\nfor the country-side: and this is not basis enough for great novels. And\r\nhis integrity--that is worse than nothing, for it was a purely moral and\r\ncommercial integrity. It satisfied his highest needs and he never dreamt\r\nthat another sort of loyalty exists.\r\n\r\nHis fame is due to two causes. In the first place, many of the elder\r\ngeneration had him read aloud to them when they were young; he is\r\nentangled with happy sentimental memories, with holidays in or residence\r\nin Scotland. They love him indeed for the same reason that I loved and\r\nstill love _The Swiss Family Robinson_. I could lecture to you now on\r\n_The Swiss Family Robinson_ and it would be a glowing lecture, because\r\nof the emotions felt in boyhood. When my brain decays entirely I shall\r\nnot bother any more over great literature. I shall go back to the\r\nromantic shore where the \"ship struck with a fearful shock,\" emitting\r\nfour demigods named Fritz, Ernest, Jack and little Franz, together with\r\ntheir father, their mother, and a cushion, which contained all the\r\nappliances necessary for a ten years' residence in the tropics. That is\r\nmy eternal summer, that is what _The Swiss Family Robinson_ means to me,\r\nand is not it all that Sir Walter Scott means to some of you? Is he\r\nreally more than a reminder of early happiness? And until our brains do\r\ndecay, must not we put all this aside when we attempt to understand\r\nbooks?\r\n\r\nIn the second place, Scott's fame rests upon one genuine basis. He could\r\ntell a story. He had the primitive power of keeping the reader in\r\nsuspense and playing on his curiosity. Let us paraphrase _The\r\nAntiquary_--not analyze it, analysis is the wrong method, but\r\nparaphrase. Then we shall see the story unrolling itself, and be able to\r\nstudy its simple devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUARY\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIt was early in a fine summer's day, near the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when a young man of genteel appearance, having occasion to go\r\ntowards the north-east of Scotland, provided himself with a ticket in\r\none of those public carriages which travel between Edinburgh and the\r\nQueensferry, at which place, as the name implies, and as is well known\r\nto all my northern readers, there is a passage-boat for crossing the\r\nFrith of Forth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the first sentence in _The Antiquary_--not an exciting sentence,\r\nbut it gives us the time, the place, and a young man,--it sets the\r\nstory-teller's scene. We feel a moderate interest in what the young man\r\nwill do next. His name is Lovel, and there is a mystery about him. He is\r\nthe hero or Scott would not call him genteel, and he is sure to make the\r\nheroine happy. He meets the Antiquary, Jonathan Oldbuck. They get into\r\nthe coach, not too quickly, become acquainted, Lovel visits Oldbuck at\r\nhis house. Near it they meet a new character, Edie Ochiltree. Scott is\r\ngood at introducing fresh characters. He slides them very naturally, and\r\nwith a promising air. Edie Ochiltree promises a good deal. He is a\r\nbeggar--no ordinary beggar, a romantic and reliable rogue, and will he\r\nnot help to solve the mystery of which we saw the tip in Lovel? More\r\nintroductions: to Sir Arthur Wardour (old family, bad manager); to his\r\ndaughter Isabella (haughty), whom the hero loves unrequited; and to\r\nOldbuck's sister Miss Grizzle. Miss Grizzle is introduced with the same\r\nair of promise. As a matter of fact she is just a comic turn--she leads\r\nnowhere, and your story-teller is full of these turns. He need not\r\nhammer away all the time at cause and effect. He keeps just as well\r\nwithin the simple boundaries of his art if he says things that have no\r\nbearing on the development. The audience thinks they will develop, but\r\nthe audience is shock-headed and tired and easily forgets. Unlike the\r\nweaver of plots, the story-teller profits by ragged ends. Miss Grizzle\r\nis a small example of a ragged end; for a big one I would refer to a\r\nnovel that professes to be lean and tragic: _The Bride of Lammermoor_.\r\nScott presents the Lord High Keeper in this book with great emphasis and\r\nwith endless suggestions that the defects of his character will lead to\r\nthe tragedy, while as a matter of fact the tragedy would occur in almost\r\nthe same form if he did not exist--the only necessary ingredients in it\r\nbeing Edgar, Lucy, Lady Ashton and Bucklaw. Well, to return to _The\r\nAntiquary_, then there is a dinner, Oldbuck and Sir Arthur quarrel, Sir\r\nArthur is offended and leaves early with his daughter, and they try to\r\nwalk back to their own house across the sands. Tides rise over sands.\r\nThe tide rises. Sir Arthur and Isabel are cut off, and are confronted in\r\ntheir peril by Edie Ochiltree. This is the first serious moment in the\r\nstory and this is how the story-teller who is a story-teller handles it:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile they exchanged these words, they paused upon the highest ledge of\r\nrock to which they could attain; for it seemed that any farther attempt\r\nto move forward could only serve to anticipate their fate. Here then\r\nthey were to await the sure, though slow progress of the raging element,\r\nsomething in the situation of the martyrs of the Early Church, who,\r\nexposed by heathen tyrants to be slain by wild beasts, were compelled\r\nfor a time to witness the impatience and rage by which the animals were\r\nagitated, while awaiting the signal for undoing their grates and letting\r\nthem loose upon the victims.\r\n\r\nYet even this fearful pause gave Isabella time to collect the powers of\r\na mind naturally strong and courageous, and which rallied itself at this\r\nterrible juncture. \"Must we yield life,\" she said, \"without a struggle?\r\nIs there no path, however dreadful, by which we could climb the crag, or\r\nat least attain some height above the tide, where we could remain till\r\nmorning, or till help comes? They must be aware of our situation, and\r\nwill raise the country to relieve us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThus speaks the heroine, in accents which certainly chill the reader.\r\nYet we want to know what happens next. The rocks are of cardboard, like\r\nthose in my dear Swiss Family; the tempest is turned on with one hand\r\nwhile Scott scribbles away about Early Christians with the other; there\r\nis no sincerity, no sense of danger in the whole affair; it is all\r\npassionless, perfunctory, yet we do just want to know what happens next.\r\n\r\nWhy--Lovel rescues them. Yes; we ought to have thought of that; and what\r\nthen?\r\n\r\nAnother ragged end. Lovel is put by the Antiquary to sleep in a haunted\r\nroom, where he has a dream or vision of his host's ancestor, who says to\r\nhim, \"Kunst macht Gunst,\" words which he does not understand at the\r\ntime, owing to his ignorance of German, and learns afterwards that they\r\nmean \"Skill wins Favour\": he must pursue the siege of Isabella's heart.\r\nThat is to say the supernatural contributes nothing to the story. It is\r\nintroduced with tapestries and storms, but only a copy-book maxim\r\nresults. The reader does not know this though. When he hears \"Kunst\r\nmacht Gunst,\" his attention reawakens ... then his attention is diverted\r\nto something else, and the time-sequence goes on.\r\n\r\nPicnic in the ruins of St. Ruth. Introduction of Dousterswivel, a wicked\r\nforeigner, who has involved Sir Arthur in mining schemes and whose\r\nsuperstitions are ridiculed because not of the genuine Border brand.\r\nArrival of Hector McIntyre, the Antiquary's nephew, who suspects Lovel\r\nof being an impostor. The two fight a duel; Lovel, thinking he has\r\nkilled his opponent, flies with Edie Ochiltree, who has turned up as\r\nusual. They hide in the ruins of St. Ruth, where they watch\r\nDousterswivel gulling Sir Arthur in a treasure-hunt. Lovel gets away on\r\na boat and--out of sight out of mind; we do not worry about him until he\r\nturns up again. Second treasure-hunt at St. Ruth. Sir Arthur finds a\r\nhoard of silver. Third treasure-hunt. Dousterswivel is soundly\r\ncudgelled, and when he comes to himself sees the funeral rites of the\r\nold Countess of Glenallan, who is being buried there at midnight and\r\nwith secrecy, that family being of the Romish persuasion.\r\n\r\nNow the Glenallans are very important in the story, yet how casually\r\nthey are introduced! They are hooked on to Dousterswivel in the most\r\nartless way. His pair of eyes happened to be handy, so Scott had a peep\r\nthrough them. And the reader by now is getting so docile under the\r\nsuccession of episodes that he just gapes, like a primitive cave man.\r\nNow the Glenallan interest gets to work, the ruins of St. Ruth are\r\nswitched off, and we enter what may be called the \"pre-story,\" where two\r\nnew characters intervene, and talk wildly and darkly about a sinful\r\npast. Their names are: Elspeth Mucklebackit, a Sibyl of a fisherwoman,\r\nand Lord Glenallan, son of the dead countess. Their dialogue is\r\ninterrupted by other events--by the arrest, trial and release of Edie\r\nOchiltree, by the death by drowning of another new character, and by the\r\nhumours of Hector McIntyre's convalescence at his uncle's house. But the\r\ngist is that Lord Glenallan many years ago had married a lady called\r\nEvelina Nevile, against his mother's wish, and had then been given to\r\nunderstand that she was his half-sister. Maddened with horror, he had\r\nleft her before she gave birth to a child. Elspeth, formerly his\r\nmother's servant, now explains to him that Evelina was no relation to\r\nhim, that she died in childbirth--Elspeth and another woman\r\nattending--and that the child disappeared. Lord Glenallan then goes to\r\nconsult the Antiquary, who, as a Justice of the Peace, knew something of\r\nthe events of the time, and who had also loved Evelina. And what happens\r\nnext? Sir Arthur Wardour's goods are sold up, for Dousterswivel has\r\nruined him. And then? The French are reported to be landing. And then?\r\nLovel rides into the district leading the British troops. He calls\r\nhimself \"Major Nevile\" now. But even \"Major Nevile\" is not his right\r\nname, for he is who but the lost child of Lord Glenallan, he is none\r\nother than the legitimate heir to an earldom. Partly through Elspeth\r\nMucklebackit, partly through her fellow servant whom he meets as a nun\r\nabroad, partly through an uncle who has died, partly through Edie\r\nOchiltree, the truth has come out. There are indeed plenty of reasons\r\nfor the dénouement, but Scott is not interested in reasons; he dumps\r\nthem down without bothering to elucidate them; to make one thing happen\r\nafter another is his only serious aim. And then? Isabella Wardour\r\nrelents and marries the hero. And then? That is the end of the story. We\r\nmust not ask \"And then?\" too often. If the time-sequence is pursued one\r\nsecond too far it leads us into quite another country.\r\n\r\n_The Antiquary_ is a book in which the life in time is celebrated\r\ninstinctively by the novelist, and this must lead to slackening of\r\nemotion and shallowness of judgment, and in particular to that idiotic\r\nuse of marriage as a finale. Time can be celebrated consciously also,\r\nand we shall find an example of this in a very different sort of book, a\r\nmemorable book: Arnold Bennett's _The Old Wives' Tale_. Time is the real\r\nhero of _The Old Wives' Tale_. He is installed as the lord of\r\ncreation--excepting indeed of Mr. Critchlow, whose bizarre exemption\r\nonly gives added force. Sophia and Constance are the children of Time\r\nfrom the instant we see them romping with their mother's dresses; they\r\nare doomed to decay with a completeness that is very rare in literature.\r\nThey are girls, Sophia runs away and marries, the mother dies, Constance\r\nmarries, her husband dies, Sophia's husband dies, Sophia dies, Constance\r\ndies, their old rheumatic dog lumbers up to see whether anything remains\r\nin the saucer. Our daily life in time is exactly this business of\r\ngetting old which clogs the arteries of Sophia and Constance, and the\r\nstory that is a story and sounded so healthy and stood no nonsense\r\ncannot sincerely lead to any conclusion but the grave. It is an\r\nunsatisfactory conclusion. Of course we grow old. But a great book must\r\nrest on something more than an \"of course,\" and _The Old Wives' Tale_ is\r\nvery strong, sincere and sad,--it misses greatness.\r\n\r\nWhat about _War and Peace_? that is certainly great, that likewise\r\nemphasizes the effects of time and the waxing and waning of a\r\ngeneration. Tolstoy, like Bennett, has the courage to show us people\r\ngetting old--the partial decay of Nicolay and Natasha is really more\r\nsinister than the complete decay of Constance and Sophia: more of our\r\nown youth seems to have perished in it. Then why is _War and Peace_ not\r\ndepressing? Probably because it has extended over space as well as over\r\ntime, and the sense of space until it terrifies us is exhilarating, and\r\nleaves behind it an effect like music. After one has read _War and\r\nPeace_ for a bit, great chords begin to sound, and we cannot say exactly\r\nwhat struck them. They do not arise from the story, though Tolstoy is\r\nquite as interested in what comes next as Scott, and quite as sincere as\r\nBennett. They do not come from the episodes nor yet from the characters.\r\nThey come from the immense area of Russia, over which episodes and\r\ncharacters have been scattered, from the sum-total of bridges and frozen\r\nrivers, forests, roads, gardens, fields, which accumulate grandeur and\r\nsonority after we have passed them. Many novelists have the feeling for\r\nplace--Five Towns, Auld Reekie, and so on. Very few have the sense of\r\nspace, and the possession of it ranks high in Tolstoy's divine\r\nequipment. Space is the lord of _War and Peace_, not time.\r\n\r\nA word in conclusion about the story as the repository of a voice. It is\r\nthe aspect of the novelist's work which asks to be read out loud, which\r\nappeals not to the eye, like most prose, but to the ear; having indeed\r\nthis much in common with oratory. It does not offer melody or cadence.\r\nFor these, strange as it may seem, the eye is sufficient; the eye,\r\nbacked by a mind that transmutes, can easily gather up the sounds of a\r\nparagraph or dialogue when they have æsthetic value, and refer them to\r\nour enjoyment,--yes, can even telescope them up so that we get them\r\nquicker than we should do if they were recited, just as some people can\r\nlook through a musical score quicker than it can be rapped out on the\r\npiano. But the eye is not equally quick at catching a voice. That\r\nopening sentence of _The Antiquary_ has no beauty of sound, yet we\r\nshould lose something if it was not read aloud. Our mind would commune\r\nwith Walter Scott's silently, and less profitably. The story, besides\r\nsaying one thing after another, adds something because of its connection\r\nwith a voice.\r\n\r\nIt does not add much. It does not give us anything as important as the\r\nauthor's personality. His personality--when he has one--is conveyed\r\nthrough nobler agencies, such as the characters or the plot or his\r\ncomments on life. What the story does do in this particular capacity,\r\nall it can do, is to transform us from readers into listeners, to whom\r\n\"a\" voice speaks, the voice of the tribal narrator, squatting in the\r\nmiddle of the cave, and saying one thing after another until the\r\naudience falls asleep among their offal and bones. The story is\r\nprimitive, it reaches back to the origins of literature, before reading\r\nwas discovered, and it appeals to what is primitive in us. That is why\r\nwe are so unreasonable over the stories we like, and so ready to bully\r\nthose who like something else. For instance, I am annoyed when people\r\nlaugh at me for loving _The Swiss Family Robinson_, and I hope that I\r\nhave annoyed some of you over Scott! You see what I mean. Intolerance is\r\nthe atmosphere stories generate. The story is neither moral nor is it\r\nfavourable to the understanding of the novel in its other aspects. If we\r\nwant to do that we must come out of the cave.\r\n\r\nWe shall not come out of it yet, but observe already how that other\r\nlife--the life by value--presses against the novel from all sides, how\r\nit is ready to fill and indeed distort it, offering it people, plots,\r\nfantasies, views of the universe, anything except this constant \"and\r\nthen ... and then,\" which is the sole contribution of our present\r\ninquiry. The life in time is so obviously base and inferior that the\r\nquestion naturally occurs: cannot the novelist abolish it from his work,\r\neven as the mystic asserts he has abolished it from his experience, and\r\ninstall its radiant alternative alone?\r\n\r\nWell, there is one novelist who has tried to abolish time, and her\r\nfailure is instructive: Gertrude Stein. Going much further than Emily\r\nBrontë, Sterne or Proust, Gertrude Stein has smashed up and pulverized\r\nher clock and scattered its fragments over the world like the limbs of\r\nOsiris, and she has done this not from naughtiness but from a noble\r\nmotive: she has hoped to emancipate fiction from the tyranny of time and\r\nto express in it the life by values only. She fails, because as soon as\r\nfiction is completely delivered from time it cannot express anything at\r\nall, and in her later writing we can see the slope down which she is\r\nslipping. She wants to abolish this whole aspect of the story, this\r\nsequence in chronology, and my heart goes out to her. She cannot do it\r\nwithout abolishing the sequence between the sentences. But this is not\r\neffective unless the order of the words in the sentences is also\r\nabolished, which in its turn entails the abolition of the order of the\r\nletters or sounds in the words. And now she is over the precipice. There\r\nis nothing to ridicule in such an experiment as hers. It is much more\r\nimportant to play about like this than to rewrite the Waverley Novels.\r\nYet the experiment is doomed to failure. The time-sequence cannot be\r\ndestroyed without carrying in its ruin all that should have taken its\r\nplace; the novel that would express values only becomes unintelligible\r\nand therefore valueless.\r\n\r\nThat is why I must ask you to join me in repeating in exactly the right\r\ntone of voice the words with which this lecture opened. Do not say them\r\nvaguely and good-temperedly like a busman: you have not the right. Do\r\nnot say them briskly and aggressively like a golfer: you know better.\r\nSay them a little sadly, and you will be correct. Yes--oh, dear,\r\nyes--the novel tells a story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING discussed the story--that simple and fundamental aspect of the\r\nnovel--we can turn to a more interesting topic: the actors. We need not\r\nask what happened next, but to whom did it happen; the novelist will be\r\nappealing to our intelligence and imagination, not merely to our\r\ncuriosity. A new emphasis enters his voice: emphasis upon value.\r\n\r\nSince the actors in a story are usually human, it seemed convenient to\r\nentitle this aspect People. Other animals have been introduced, but with\r\nlimited success, for we know too little so far about their psychology.\r\nThere may be, probably will be, an alteration here in the future,\r\ncomparable to the alteration in the novelist's rendering of savages in\r\nthe past. The gulf that separates Man Friday from Batouala may be\r\nparalleled by the gulf that will separate Kipling's wolves from their\r\nliterary descendants two hundred years hence, and we shall have animals\r\nwho are neither symbolic, nor little men disguised, nor as four-legged\r\ntables moving, nor as painted scraps of paper that fly. It is one of the\r\nways where science may enlarge the novel, by giving it fresh subject\r\nmatter. But the help has not been given yet, and until it comes we may\r\nsay that the actors in a story are, or pretend to be, human beings.\r\n\r\nSince the novelist is himself a human being, there is an affinity\r\nbetween him and his subject matter which is absent in many other forms\r\nof art. The historian is also linked, though, as we shall see, less\r\nintimately. The painter and sculptor need not be linked: that is to say\r\nthey need not represent human beings unless they wish, no more need the\r\npoet, while the musician cannot represent them even if he wishes,\r\nwithout the help of a programme. The novelist, unlike many of his\r\ncolleagues, makes up a number of word-masses roughly describing himself\r\n(roughly: niceties shall come later), gives them names and sex, assigns\r\nthem plausible gestures, and causes them to speak by the use of inverted\r\ncommas, and perhaps to behave consistently. These word-masses are his\r\ncharacters. They do not come thus coldly to his mind, they may be\r\ncreated in delirious excitement, still, their nature is conditioned by\r\nwhat he guesses about other people, and about himself, and is further\r\nmodified by the other aspects of his work. This last point--the relation\r\nof characters to the other aspects of the novel--will form the subject\r\nof a future enquiry. At present we are occupied with their relation to\r\nactual life. What is the difference between people in a novel and people\r\nlike the novelist or like you, or like me, or Queen Victoria?\r\n\r\nThere is bound to be a difference. If a character in a novel is exactly\r\nlike Queen Victoria--not rather like but exactly like--then it actually\r\nis Queen Victoria, and the novel, or all of it that the character\r\ntouches, becomes a memoir. A memoir is history, it is based on evidence.\r\nA novel is based on evidence + or − _x_, the unknown quantity being\r\nthe temperament of the novelist, and the unknown quantity always\r\nmodifies the effect of the evidence, and sometimes transforms it\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThe historian deals with actions, and with the characters of men only so\r\nfar as he can deduce them from their actions. He is quite as much\r\nconcerned with character as the novelist, but he can only know of its\r\nexistence when it shows on the surface. If Queen Victoria had not said,\r\n\"We are not amused,\" her neighbours at table would not have known she\r\nwas not amused, and her ennui could never have been announced to the\r\npublic. She might have frowned, so that they would have deduced her\r\nstate from that--looks and gestures are also historical evidence. But if\r\nshe remained impassive--what would any one know? The hidden life is, by\r\ndefinition, hidden. The hidden life that appears in external signs is\r\nhidden no longer, has entered the realm of action. And it is the\r\nfunction of the novelist to reveal the hidden life at its source: to\r\ntell us more about Queen Victoria than could be known, and thus to\r\nproduce a character who is not the Queen Victoria of history.\r\n\r\nThe interesting and sensitive French critic, who writes under the name\r\nof Alain, has some helpful if slightly fantastic remarks on this point.\r\nHe gets a little out of his depth, but not as much as I feel myself out\r\nof mine, and perhaps together we may move toward the shore. Alain\r\nexamines in turn the various forms of æsthetic activity, and coming in\r\ntime to the novel (le roman) he asserts that each human being has two\r\nsides, appropriate to history and fiction. All that is observable in a\r\nman--that is to say his actions and such of his spiritual existence as\r\ncan be deduced from his actions--falls into the domain of history. But\r\nhis romanceful or romantic side (sa partie romanesque ou romantique)\r\nincludes \"the pure passions, that is to say the dreams, joys, sorrows\r\nand self-communings which politeness or shame prevent him from\r\nmentioning\"; and to express this side of human nature is one of the\r\nchief functions of the novel. \"What is fictitious in a novel is not so\r\nmuch the story as the method by which thought develops into action, a\r\nmethod which never occurs in daily life.... History, with its emphasis\r\non external causes, is dominated by the notion of fatality, whereas\r\nthere is no fatality in the novel; there, everything is founded on human\r\nnature, and the dominating feeling is of an existence where everything\r\nis intentional, even passions and crimes, even misery.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a roundabout way of saying what every British schoolboy\r\nknew, that the historian records whereas the novelist must create.\r\nStill, it is a profitable roundabout, for it brings out the fundamental\r\ndifference between people in daily life and people in books. In daily\r\nlife we never understand each other, neither complete clairvoyance nor\r\ncomplete confessional exists. We know each other approximately, by\r\nexternal signs, and these serve well enough as a basis for society and\r\neven for intimacy. But people in a novel can be understood completely by\r\nthe reader, if the novelist wishes; their inner as well as their outer\r\nlife can be exposed. And this is why they often seem more definite than\r\ncharacters in history, or even our own friends; we have been told all\r\nabout them that can be told; even if they are imperfect or unreal they\r\ndo not contain any secrets, whereas our friends do and must, mutual\r\nsecrecy being one of the conditions of life upon this globe.\r\n\r\nNow let us restate the problem in a more schoolboyish way. You and I are\r\npeople. Had not we better glance through the main facts in our own\r\nlives--not in our individual careers but in our make-up as human beings?\r\nThen we shall have something definite to start from.\r\n\r\nThe main facts in human life are five: birth, food, sleep, love and\r\ndeath. One could increase the number--add breathing for instance--but\r\nthese five are the most obvious. Let us briefly ask ourselves what part\r\nthey play in our lives, and what in novels. Does the novelist tend to\r\nreproduce them accurately or does he tend to exaggerate, minimize,\r\nignore, and to exhibit his characters going through processes which are\r\nnot the same through which you and I go, though they bear the same\r\nnames?\r\n\r\nTo consider the two strangest first: birth and death; strange because\r\nthey are at the same time experiences and not experiences. We only know\r\nof them by report. We were all born, but we cannot remember what it was\r\nlike. And death is coming even as birth has come, but, similarly, we do\r\nnot know what it is like. Our final experience, like our first, is\r\nconjectural. We move between two darknesses. Certain people pretend to\r\ntell us what birth and death are like: a mother, for instance, has her\r\npoint of view about birth, a doctor, a religious, have their points of\r\nview about both. But it is all from the outside, and the two entities\r\nwho might enlighten us, the baby and the corpse, cannot do so, because\r\ntheir apparatus for communicating their experiences is not attuned to\r\nour apparatus for reception.\r\n\r\nSo let us think of people as starting life with an experience they\r\nforget and ending it with one which they anticipate but cannot\r\nunderstand. These are the creatures whom the novelist proposes to\r\nintroduce as characters into books; these, or creatures plausibly like\r\nthem. The novelist is allowed to remember and understand everything, if\r\nit suits him. He knows all the hidden life. How soon will he pick up his\r\ncharacters after birth, how close to the grave will he follow them? And\r\nwhat will he say, or cause to be felt, about these two queer\r\nexperiences?\r\n\r\nThen food, the stoking up process, the keeping alive of an individual\r\nflame, the process that begins before birth and is continued after it by\r\nthe mother, and finally taken over by the individual himself, who goes\r\non day after day putting an assortment of objects into a hole in his\r\nface without becoming surprised or bored: food is a link between the\r\nknown and the forgotten; closely connected with birth, which none of us\r\nremembers, and coming down to this morning's breakfast. Like\r\nsleep--which in many ways it resembles--food does not merely restore our\r\nstrength, it has also an æsthetic side, it can taste good or bad. What\r\nwill happen to this double-faced commodity in books?\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, sleep. On the average, about a third of our time is not\r\nspent in society or civilization or even in what is usually called\r\nsolitude. We enter a world of which little is known and which seems to\r\nus after leaving it to have been partly oblivion, partly a caricature of\r\nthis world and partly a revelation. \"I dreamt of nothing\" or \"I dreamt\r\nof a ladder\" or \"I dreamt of heaven\" we say when we wake. I do not want\r\nto discuss the nature of sleep and dreams--only to point out that they\r\noccupy much time and that what is called \"History\" only busies itself\r\nwith about two-thirds of the human cycle, and theorizes accordingly.\r\nDoes fiction take up a similar attitude?\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, love. I am using this celebrated word in its widest and\r\ndullest sense. Let me be very dry and brief about sex in the first\r\nplace. Some years after a human being is born, certain changes occur in\r\nit, as in other animals, which changes often lead to union with another\r\nhuman being, and to the production of more human beings. And our race\r\ngoes on. Sex begins before adolescence, and survives sterility; it is\r\nindeed coeval with our lives, although at the mating age its effects are\r\nmore obvious to society. And besides sex, there are other emotions, also\r\nstrengthening towards maturity: the various upliftings of the spirit,\r\nsuch as affection, friendship, patriotism, mysticism--and as soon as we\r\ntry to determine the relation between sex and these other emotions we\r\nshall of course begin to quarrel as violently as we ever could about\r\nWalter Scott, perhaps even more violently. Let me only tabulate the\r\nvarious points of view. Some people say that sex is basic and underlies\r\nall these other loves--love of friends, of God, of country. Others say\r\nthat it is connected with them, but laterally, it is not their root.\r\nOthers say that it is not connected at all. All I suggest is that we\r\ncall the whole bundle of emotions love, and regard them as the fifth\r\ngreat experience through which human beings have to pass. When human\r\nbeings love they try to get something. They also try to give something,\r\nand this double aim makes love more complicated than food or sleep. It\r\nis selfish and altruistic at the same time, and no amount of\r\nspecialization in one direction quite atrophies the other. How much time\r\ndoes love take? This question sounds gross but it must be asked because\r\nit bears on our present enquiry. Sleep takes about eight hours out of\r\nthe twenty-four, food about two more. Shall we put down love for another\r\ntwo? Surely that is a handsome allowance. Love may weave itself into our\r\nother activities--so may drowsiness and hunger. Love may start various\r\nsecondary activities: for instance, a man's love for his family may\r\ncause him to spend a good deal of time on the Stock Exchange, or his\r\nlove for God a good deal of time in church. But that he has emotional\r\ncommunion with any beloved object for more than two hours a day may be\r\ngravely doubted, and it is this emotional communion, this desire to give\r\nand to get, this mixture of generosity and expectation, that\r\ndistinguishes love from the other experiences on our list.\r\n\r\nThat is the human make-up--or part of it. Made up like this himself, the\r\nnovelist takes his pen in his hand, gets into the abnormal state which\r\nit is convenient to call \"inspiration,\" and tries to create characters.\r\nPerhaps the characters have to fall in with something else in his novel:\r\nthis often happens (the books of Henry James are an extreme case), and\r\nthen the characters have, of course, to modify the make-up accordingly.\r\nHowever, we are considering now the more simple case of the novelist\r\nwhose main passion is human beings and who will sacrifice a great deal\r\nto their convenience--story, plot, form, incidental beauty.\r\n\r\nWell, in what senses do the nations of fiction differ from those of the\r\nearth? One cannot generalize about them, because they have nothing in\r\ncommon in the scientific sense; they need not have glands, for example,\r\nwhereas all human beings have glands. Nevertheless, though incapable of\r\nstrict definition, they tend to behave along the same lines.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they come into the world more like parcels than\r\nhuman beings. When a baby arrives in a novel it usually has the air of\r\nhaving been posted. It is delivered \"off\"; one of the elder characters\r\ngoes and picks it up and shows it to the reader, after which it is\r\nusually laid in cold storage until it can talk or otherwise assist in\r\nthe action. There is both a good and a bad reason for this and for all\r\nother deviations from earthly practice; these we will note in a minute,\r\nbut do just observe in what a very perfunctory way the population of\r\nnoveldom is recruited. Between Sterne and James Joyce, scarcely any\r\nwriter has tried either to use the facts of birth or to invent a new set\r\nof facts, and no one, except in a sort of auntish wistful way, has tried\r\nto work back towards the psychology of the baby's mind and to utilize\r\nthe literary wealth that must lie there. Perhaps it cannot be done. We\r\nshall decide in a moment.\r\n\r\nDeath. The treatment of death, on the other hand, is nourished much more\r\non observation, and has a variety about it which suggests that the\r\nnovelist finds it congenial. He does, for the reason that death ends a\r\nbook neatly, and for the less obvious reason that working as he does in\r\ntime he finds it easier to work from the known towards the darkness\r\nrather than from the darkness of birth towards the known. By the time\r\nhis characters die, he understands them, he can be both appropriate and\r\nimaginative about them--strongest of combinations. Take a little\r\ndeath--the death of Mrs. Proudie in the _Last Chronicle of Barset_. All\r\nis in keeping, yet the effect is terrifying, because Trollope has ambled\r\nMrs. Proudie down many a diocesan bypath, showing her paces, making her\r\nsnap, accustoming us, even to boredom, to her character and tricks, to\r\nher \"Bishop, consider the souls of the people,\" and then she has a heart\r\nattack by the edge of her bed, she has ambled far enough,--end of Mrs.\r\nProudie. There is scarcely anything that the novelist cannot borrow from\r\n\"daily death\"; scarcely anything he may not profitably invent. The doors\r\nof that darkness lie open to him and he can even follow his characters\r\nthrough it, provided he is shod with imagination and does not try to\r\nbring us back scraps of séance information about the \"life beyond.\"\r\n\r\nWhat of food, the third fact upon our list? Food in fiction is mainly\r\nsocial. It draws characters together, but they seldom require it\r\nphysiologically, seldom enjoy it, and never digest it unless specially\r\nasked to do so. They hunger for each other, as we do in life, but our\r\nequally constant longing for breakfast and lunch does not get reflected.\r\nEven poetry has made more of it--at least of its æsthetic side. Milton\r\nand Keats have both come nearer to the sensuousness of swallowing than\r\nGeorge Meredith.\r\n\r\nSleep. Also perfunctory. No attempt to indicate oblivion or the actual\r\ndream world. Dreams are either logical or else mosaics made out of hard\r\nlittle fragments of the past and future. They are introduced with a\r\npurpose and that purpose is not the character's life as a whole, but\r\nthat part of it he lives while awake. He is never conceived as a\r\ncreature a third of whose time is spent in the darkness. It is the\r\nlimited daylight vision of the historian, which the novelist elsewhere\r\navoids. Why should he not understand or reconstruct sleep? For remember,\r\nhe has the right to invent, and we know when he is inventing truly,\r\nbecause his passion floats us over improbabilities. Yet he has neither\r\ncopied sleep nor created it. It is just an amalgam.\r\n\r\nLove. You all know how enormously love bulks in novels, and will\r\nprobably agree with me that it has done them harm and made them\r\nmonotonous. Why has this particular experience, especially in its sex\r\nform, been transplanted in such generous quantities? If you think of a\r\nnovel in the vague you think of a love interest--of a man and woman who\r\nwant to be united and perhaps succeed. If you think of your own life in\r\nthe vague, or of a group of lives, you are left with a very different\r\nand a more complex impression.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be two reasons why love, even in good sincere\r\nnovels, is unduly prominent.\r\n\r\nFirstly, when the novelist ceases to design his characters and begins to\r\ncreate them--\"love\" in any or all of its aspects becomes important in\r\nhis mind, and without intending to do so he makes his characters unduly\r\nsensitive to it--unduly in the sense that they would not trouble so much\r\nin life. The constant sensitiveness of characters for each other--even\r\nin writers called robust like Fielding--is remarkable, and has no\r\nparallel in life, except among people who have plenty of leisure.\r\nPassion, intensity at moments--yes, but not this constant awareness,\r\nthis endless readjusting, this ceaseless hunger. I believe that these\r\nare the reflections of the novelist's own state of mind while he\r\ncomposes, and that the predominance of love in novels is partly because\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nA second reason; which logically comes into another part of our enquiry,\r\nbut it shall be noted here. Love, like death, is congenial to a novelist\r\nbecause it ends a book conveniently. He can make it a permanency, and\r\nhis readers easily acquiesce, because one of the illusions attached to\r\nlove is that it will be permanent. Not has been--will be. All history,\r\nall our experience, teaches us that no human relationship is constant,\r\nit is as unstable as the living beings who compose it, and they must\r\nbalance like jugglers if it is to remain; if it is constant it is no\r\nlonger a human relationship but a social habit, the emphasis in it has\r\npassed from love to marriage. All this we know, yet we cannot bear to\r\napply our bitter knowledge to the future; the future is to be so\r\ndifferent; the perfect person is to come along, or the person we know\r\nalready is to become perfect. There are to be no changes, no necessity\r\nfor alertness. We are to be happy or even perhaps miserable for ever and\r\never. Any strong emotion brings with it the illusion of permanence, and\r\nthe novelists have seized upon this. They usually end their books with\r\nmarriage, and we do not object because we lend them our dreams.\r\n\r\nHere we must conclude our comparison of those two allied species, Homo\r\nSapiens and Homo Fictus. Homo Fictus is more elusive than his cousin. He\r\nis created in the minds of hundreds of different novelists, who have\r\nconflicting methods of gestation, so one must not generalize. Still, one\r\ncan say a little about him. He is generally born off, he is capable of\r\ndying on, he wants little food or sleep, he is tirelessly occupied with\r\nhuman relationships. And--most important--we can know more about him\r\nthan we can know about any of our fellow creatures, because his creator\r\nand narrator are one. Were we equipped for hyperbole we might exclaim at\r\nthis point: \"If God could tell the story of the Universe, the Universe\r\nwould become fictitious.\"\r\n\r\nFor this is the principle involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us, after these high speculations, take an easy character and study\r\nit for a little. Moll Flanders will do. She fills the book that bears\r\nher name, or rather stands alone in it, like a tree in a park, so that\r\nwe can see her from every aspect and are not bothered by rival growths.\r\nDefoe is telling a story, like Scott, and we shall find stray threads\r\nleft about in much the same way, on the chance of the writer wanting to\r\npick them up afterwards: Moll's early batch of children for instance.\r\nBut the parallel between Scott and Defoe cannot be pressed. What\r\ninterested Defoe was the heroine, and the form of his book proceeds\r\nnaturally out of her character. Seduced by a younger brother and married\r\nto an elder, she takes to husbands in the earlier and brighter part of\r\nher career: not to prostitution, which she detests with all the force of\r\na decent and affectionate heart. She and most of the characters in\r\nDefoe's underworld are kind to one another, they save each other's\r\nfeelings and run risks through personal loyalty. Their innate goodness\r\nis always flourishing despite the author's better judgment, the reason\r\nevidently being that the author had some great experience himself while\r\nin Newgate. We do not know what it was, probably he himself did not know\r\nafterwards, for he was a busy slipshod journalist and a keen politician.\r\nBut something occurred to him in prison, and out of its vague, powerful\r\nemotion Moll and Roxana are born. Moll is a character physically, with\r\nhard plump limbs that get into bed and pick pockets. She lays no stress\r\nupon her appearance, yet she moves us as having height and weight, as\r\nbreathing and eating, and doing many of the things that are usually\r\nmissed out. Husbands were her earlier employ: she was trigamous if not\r\nquadrigamous, and one of her husbands turned out to be a brother. She\r\nwas happy with all of them, they were nice to her, she nice to them.\r\nListen to the pleasant jaunt her draper husband took her--she never\r\ncared for him much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Come, my dear,\" says he to me one day, \"shall we go and take a turn\r\ninto the country for about a week?\" \"Ay, my dear,\" says I, \"whither\r\nwould you go?\" \"I care not whither,\" says he, \"but I have a mind to look\r\nlike quality for a week. We'll go to Oxford,\" says he. \"How,\" says I,\r\n\"shall we go? I am no horse-woman, and 'tis too far for a coach.\" \"Too\r\nfar!\" says he; \"no place is too far for a coach-and-six. If I carry you\r\nout, you shall travel like a duchess.\" \"Hum,\" says I, \"my dear, 'tis a\r\nfrolic; but if you have a mind to it, I don't care.\" Well, the time was\r\nappointed, we had a rich coach, very good horses, a coachman, postilion,\r\nand two footmen in very good liveries; a gentleman on horseback, and a\r\npage with a feather in his hat upon another horse. The servants all\r\ncalled my lord, and the innkeepers, you may be sure, did the like, and I\r\nwas her honour the Countess, and thus we travelled to Oxford, and a very\r\npleasant journey we had; for, give him his due, not a beggar alive knew\r\nbetter how to be a lord than my husband. We saw all the rarities at\r\nOxford, talked with two or three Fellows of Colleges about putting out a\r\nyoung nephew, that was left to his lordship's care, to the University,\r\nand of their being his tutors. We diverted ourselves with bantering\r\nseveral other poor Scholars, with hopes of being at least his lordship's\r\nchaplains, and putting on a scarf; and thus having lived like quality,\r\nindeed, as to expense, we went away for Northampton, and, in a word, in\r\nabout twelve days' ramble came home again, to the tune of about £93\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n\r\nContrast with this the scene with her Lancashire husband, whom she\r\ndeeply loved. He is a high-wayman, and each by pretending to wealth has\r\ntrapped the other into marriage. After the ceremony, they are mutually\r\nunmasked, and if Defoe were writing mechanically he would set them to\r\nupbraid one another, like Mr. and Mrs. Lammle in _Our Mutual Friend_.\r\nBut he has given himself over to the humour and good sense of his\r\nheroine. She guides him through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said I to him, \"I found you would soon have conquered me; and\r\nit is my affliction now, that I am not in a condition to let you see how\r\neasily I should have been reconciled to you, and have passed by all the\r\ntricks you had put upon me, in recompense of so much good-humour. But,\r\nmy dear,\" said I, \"what can we do now? We are both undone, and what\r\nbetter are we for our being reconciled together, seeing we have nothing\r\nto live on?\"\r\n\r\nWe proposed a great many things, but nothing could offer where there was\r\nnothing to begin with. He begged me at last to talk no more of it, for,\r\nhe said, I would break his heart; so we talked of other things a little,\r\ntill at last he took a husband's leave of me, and so we went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich is both truer to daily life and pleasanter to read than Dickens.\r\nThe couple are up against facts, not against the author's theory of\r\nmorality, and being sensible good-hearted rogues, they do not make a\r\nfuss. In the later part of her career she turns from husbands to\r\nthieving; she thinks this a change for the worse and a natural darkness\r\nspreads over the scene. But she is as firm and amusing as ever. How just\r\nare her reflections when she robs of her gold necklace the little girl\r\nreturning from the dancing-class. The deed is done in the little passage\r\nleading to St. Bartholomew's, Smithfield (you can visit the place\r\ntoday--Defoe haunts London) and her impulse is to kill the child as\r\nwell. She does not, the impulse is very feeble, but conscious of the\r\nrisk the child has run she becomes most indignant with the parents for\r\n\"leaving the poor little lamb to come home by itself, and it would teach\r\nthem to take more care of it another time.\" How heavily and\r\npretentiously a modern psychologist would labour to express this! It\r\njust runs off Defoe's pen, and so in another passage, where Moll cheats\r\na man, and then tells him pleasantly afterwards that she has done so,\r\nwith the result that she slides still further into his good graces, and\r\ncannot bear to cheat him any more. Whatever she does gives us a slight\r\nshock--not the jolt of disillusionment, but the thrill that proceeds\r\nfrom a living being. We laugh at her, but without bitterness or\r\nsuperiority. She is neither hypocrite nor fool.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the book she is caught in a draper's shop by two\r\nyoung ladies from behind the counter: \"I would have given them good\r\nwords but there was no room for it: two fiery dragons could not have\r\nbeen more furious than they were\"--they call for the police, she is\r\narrested and sentenced to death and then transported to Virginia\r\ninstead. The clouds of misfortune lift with indecent rapidity. The\r\nvoyage is a very pleasant one, owing to the kindness of the old woman\r\nwho had originally taught her to steal. And (better still) her\r\nLancashire husband happens to be transported also. They land at Virginia\r\nwhere, much to her distress, her brother-husband proves to be in\r\nresidence. She conceals this, he dies, and the Lancashire husband only\r\nblames her for concealing it from him: he has no other grievance, for\r\nthe reason that he and she are still in love. So the book closes\r\nprosperously, and firm as at the opening sentence the heroine's voice\r\nrings out: \"We resolve to spend the remainder of our years in sincere\r\npenitence for the wicked lives we have led.\"\r\n\r\nHer penitence is sincere, and only a superficial judge will condemn her\r\nas a hypocrite. A nature such as hers cannot for long distinguish\r\nbetween doing wrong and getting caught--for a sentence or two she\r\ndisentangles them but they insist on blending, and that is why her\r\noutlook is so cockneyfied and natural, with \"sich is life\" for a\r\nphilosophy and Newgate in the place of Hell. If we were to press her or\r\nher creator Defoe and say, \"Come, be serious. Do you believe in\r\nInfinity?\" they would say (in the parlance of their modern descendants),\r\n\"Of course I believe in Infinity--what do you take me for?\"--a\r\nconfession of faith that slams the door on Infinity more completely than\r\ncould any denial.\r\n\r\n_Moll Flanders_ then shall stand as our example of a novel, in which a\r\ncharacter is everything and is given freest play. Defoe makes a slight\r\nattempt at a plot with the brother-husband as a centre, but he is quite\r\nperfunctory, and her legal husband (the one who took her on the jaunt to\r\nOxford) just disappears and is heard of no more. Nothing matters but the\r\nheroine; she stands in an open space like a tree, and having said that\r\nshe seems absolutely real from every point of view, we must ask\r\nourselves whether we should recognize her if we met her in daily life.\r\nFor that is the point we are still considering: the difference between\r\npeople in life and people in books. And the odd thing is, that even\r\nthough we take a character as natural and untheoretical as Moll who\r\nwould coincide with daily life in every detail, we should not find her\r\nthere as a whole. Suppose I suddenly altered my voice from a lecturing\r\nvoice into an ordinary one and said to you, \"Look out--I can see Moll in\r\nthe audience--look out, Mr.\"--naming one of you by name--\"she as near as\r\ncould be got your watch\"--well, you would know at once that I was wrong,\r\nthat I was sinning not only against probabilities, which does not\r\nsignify, but against daily life and books and the gulf that divides\r\nthem. If I said, \"Look out, there's some one like Moll in the audience,\"\r\nyou might not believe me but you would not be annoyed by my imbecile\r\nlack of taste: I should only be sinning against probability. To suggest\r\nthat Moll is in Cambridge this afternoon or anywhere in England, or has\r\nbeen anywhere in England is idiotic. Why?\r\n\r\nThis particular question will be easy to answer next week, when we shall\r\ndeal with more complicated novels, where the character has to fit in\r\nwith other aspects of fiction. We shall then be able to make the usual\r\nreply, which we find in all manuals of literature, and which should\r\nalways be given in an examination paper, the æsthetic reply, to the\r\neffect that a novel is a work of art, with its own laws, which are not\r\nthose of daily life, and that a character in a novel is real when it\r\nlives in accordance with such laws. Amelia or Emma, we shall then say,\r\ncannot be at this lecture because they exist only in the books called\r\nafter them, only in worlds of Fielding or Jane Austen. The barrier of\r\nart divides them from us. They are real not because they are like\r\nourselves (though they may be like us) but because they are convincing.\r\n\r\nIt is a good answer, it will lead on to some sound conclusions. Yet it\r\nis not satisfactory for a novel like _Moll Flanders_, where the\r\ncharacter is everything and can do what it likes. We want a reply that\r\nis less aesthetic and more psychological. Why cannot she be here? What\r\nseparates her from us? Our answer has already been implied in that\r\nquotation from Alain: she cannot be here because she belongs to a world\r\nwhere the secret life is visible, to a world that is not and cannot be\r\nours, to a world where the narrator and the creator are one. And now we\r\ncan get a definition as to when a character in a book is real: it is\r\nreal when the novelist knows everything about it. He may not choose to\r\ntell us all he knows--many of the facts, even of the kind we call\r\nobvious, may be hidden. But he will give us the feeling that though the\r\ncharacter has not been explained, it is explicable, and we get from this\r\na reality of a kind we can never get in daily life.\r\n\r\nFor human intercourse, as soon as we look at it for its own sake and not\r\nas a social adjunct, is seen to be haunted by a spectre. We cannot\r\nunderstand each other, except in a rough and ready way; we cannot reveal\r\nourselves, even when we want to; what we call intimacy is only a\r\nmakeshift; perfect knowledge is an illusion. But in the novel we can\r\nknow people perfectly, and, apart from the general pleasure of reading,\r\nwe can find here a compensation for their dimness in life. In this\r\ndirection fiction is truer than history, because it goes beyond the\r\nevidence, and each of us knows from his own experience that there is\r\nsomething beyond the evidence, and even if the novelist has not got it\r\ncorrectly, well--he has tried. He can post his people in as babies, he\r\ncan cause them to go on without sleep or food, he can make them be in\r\nlove, love and nothing but love, provided he seems to know everything\r\nabout them, provided they are his creations. That is why Moll Flanders\r\ncannot be here, that is one of the reasons why Amelia and Emma cannot be\r\nhere. They are people whose secret lives are visible or might be\r\nvisible: we are people whose secret lives are invisible.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why novels, even when they are about wicked people, can\r\nsolace us; they suggest a more comprehensible and thus a more manageable\r\nhuman race, they give us the illusion of perspicacity and of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Paraphrased from _Système des Beaux Arts_, pp. 314-315.\r\nI am indebted to M. André Maurois for introducing me to this\r\nstimulating essay.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nPEOPLE (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWE now turn from transplantation to acclimatization. We have discussed\r\nwhether people could be taken out of life and put into a book, and\r\nconversely whether they could come out of books and sit down in this\r\nroom. The answer suggested was in the negative and led to a more vital\r\nquestion: can we, in daily life, understand each other? Today our\r\nproblems are more academic. We are concerned with the characters in\r\ntheir relation to other aspects of the novel; to a plot, a moral, their\r\nfellow characters, atmosphere, etc. They will have to adapt themselves\r\nto other requirements of their creator.\r\n\r\nIt follows that we shall no longer expect them to coincide as a whole\r\nwith daily life, only to parallel it. When we say that a character in\r\nJane Austen, Miss Bates for instance, is \"so like life\" we mean that\r\neach bit of her coincides with a bit of life, but that she as a whole\r\nonly parallels the chatty spinster we met at tea. Miss Bates is bound by\r\na hundred threads to Highbury. We cannot tear her away without bringing\r\nher mother too, and Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill, and the whole of\r\nBox Hill; whereas we could tear Moll Flanders away, at least for the\r\npurposes of experiment. A Jane Austen novel is more complicated than a\r\nDefoe, because the characters are inter-dependent, and there is the\r\nadditional complication of a plot. The plot in _Emma_ is not prominent\r\nand Miss Bates contributes little. Still it is there, she is connected\r\nwith the principals, and the result is a closely woven fabric from which\r\nnothing can be removed. Miss Bates and Emma herself are like bushes in a\r\nshrubbery--not isolated trees like Moll--and any one who has tried to\r\nthin out a shrubbery knows how wretched the bushes look if they are\r\ntransplanted elsewhere, and how wretched is the look of the bushes that\r\nremain. In most books the characters cannot spread themselves. They must\r\nexercise a mutual restraint.\r\n\r\nThe novelist, we are beginning to see, has a very mixed lot of\r\ningredients to handle. There is the story, with its time-sequence of\r\n\"and then ... and then ...\"; there are ninepins about whom he might\r\ntell the story, and tell a rattling good one, but no, he prefers to tell\r\nhis story about human beings; he takes over the life by values as well\r\nas the life in time. The characters arrive when evoked, but full of the\r\nspirit of mutiny. For they have these numerous parallels with people\r\nlike ourselves, they try to live their own lives and are consequently\r\noften engaged in treason against the main scheme of the book. They \"run\r\naway,\" they \"get out of hand\": they are creations inside a creation, and\r\noften inharmonious towards it; if they are given complete freedom they\r\nkick the book to pieces, and if they are kept too sternly in check, they\r\nrevenge themselves by dying, and destroy it by intestinal decay.\r\n\r\nThese trials beset the dramatist also, and he has yet another set of\r\ningredients to cope with--the actors and actresses--and they appear to\r\nside sometimes with the characters they represent, sometimes with the\r\nplay as a whole, and more often to be the mortal enemies of both. The\r\nweight they throw is incalculable, and how any work of art survives\r\ntheir arrival I do not understand. Concerned with a lower form of art,\r\nwe need not worry--but, in passing, is it not extraordinary that plays\r\non the stage are often better than they are in the study, and that the\r\nintroduction of a bunch of rather ambitious and nervous men and women\r\nshould add anything to our understanding of Shakespeare and Tchekov?\r\n\r\nNo, the novelist has difficulties enough, and today we shall examine two\r\nof his devices for solving them--instinctive devices, for his methods\r\nwhen working are seldom the same as the methods we use when examining\r\nhis work. The first device is the use of different kinds of characters.\r\nThe second is connected with the point of view.\r\n\r\ni. We may divide characters into flat and round.\r\n\r\nFlat characters were called \"humours\" in the seventeenth century, and\r\nare sometimes called types, and sometimes caricatures. In their purest\r\nform, they are constructed round a single idea or quality: when there is\r\nmore than one factor in them, we get the beginning of the curve towards\r\nthe round. The really flat character can be expressed in one sentence\r\nsuch as \"I never will desert Mr. Micawber.\" There is Mrs. Micawber--she\r\nsays she won't desert Mr. Micawber, she doesn't, and there she is. Or:\r\n\"I must conceal, even by subterfuges, the poverty of my master's house.\"\r\nThere is Caleb Balderstone in _The Bride of Lammermoor_. He does not use\r\nthe actual phrase, but it completely describes him; he has no existence\r\noutside it, no pleasures, none of the private lusts and aches that must\r\ncomplicate the most consistent of servitors. Whatever he does, wherever\r\nhe goes, whatever lies he tells or plates he breaks, it is to conceal\r\nthe poverty of his master's house. It is not his idée fixe, because\r\nthere is nothing in him into which the idea can be fixed. He is the\r\nidea, and such life as he possesses radiates from its edges and from the\r\nscintillations it strikes when other elements in the novel impinge. Or\r\ntake Proust. There are numerous flat characters in Proust, such as the\r\nPrincess of Parma, or Legrandin. Each can be expressed in a single\r\nsentence, the Princess's sentence being, \"I must be particularly careful\r\nto be kind.\" She does nothing except to be particularly careful, and\r\nthose of the other characters who are more complex than herself easily\r\nsee through the kindness, since it is only a by-product of the\r\ncarefulness.\r\n\r\nOne great advantage of flat characters is that they are easily\r\nrecognized whenever they come in--recognized by the reader's emotional\r\neye, not by the visual eye, which merely notes the recurrence of a\r\nproper name. In Russian novels, where they so seldom occur, they would\r\nbe a decided help. It is a convenience for an author when he can strike\r\nwith his full force at once, and flat characters are very useful to him,\r\nsince they never need reintroducing, never run away, have not to be\r\nwatched for development, and provide their own atmosphere--little\r\nluminous disks of a pre-arranged size, pushed hither and thither like\r\ncounters across the void or between the stars; most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA second advantage is that they are easily remembered by the reader\r\nafterwards. They remain in his mind as unalterable for the reason that\r\nthey were not changed by circumstances; they moved through\r\ncircumstances, which gives them in retrospect a comforting quality, and\r\npreserves them when the book that produced them may decay. The Countess\r\nin _Evan Harrington_ furnishes a good little example here. Let us\r\ncompare our memories of her with our memories of Becky Sharp. We do not\r\nremember what the Countess did or what she passed through. What is clear\r\nis her figure and the formula that surrounds it, namely, \"Proud as we\r\nare of dear papa, we must conceal his memory.\" All her rich humour\r\nproceeds from this. She is a flat character. Becky is round. She, too,\r\nis on the make, but she cannot be summed up in a single phrase, and we\r\nremember her in connection with the great scenes through which she\r\npassed and as modified by those scenes--that is to say, we do not\r\nremember her so easily because she waxes and wanes and has facets like a\r\nhuman being. All of us, even the sophisticated, yearn for permanence,\r\nand to the unsophisticated permanence is the chief excuse for a work of\r\nart. We all want books to endure, to be refuges, and their inhabitants\r\nto be always the same, and flat characters tend to justify themselves on\r\nthis account.\r\n\r\nAll the same, critics who have their eyes fixed severely upon daily\r\nlife--as were our eyes last week--have very little patience with such\r\nrenderings of human nature. Queen Victoria, they argue, cannot be summed\r\nup in a single sentence, so what excuse remains for Mrs. Micawber? One\r\nof our foremost writers, Mr. Norman Douglas, is a critic of this type,\r\nand the passage from him which I will quote puts the case against flat\r\ncharacters in a forcible fashion. The passage occurs in an open letter\r\nto D. H. Lawrence, with whom he is quarrelling: a doughty pair of\r\ncombatants, the hardness of whose hitting makes the rest of us feel like\r\na lot of ladies up in a pavilion. He complains that Lawrence, in a\r\nbiography, has falsified the picture by employing \"the novelist's\r\ntouch,\" and he goes on to define what this is:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt consists, I should say, in a failure to realize the complexities of\r\nthe ordinary human mind; it selects for literary purposes two or three\r\nfacets of a man or woman, generally the most spectacular, and therefore\r\nuseful ingredients of their character and disregards all the others.\r\nWhatever fails to fit in with these specially chosen traits is\r\neliminated--must be eliminated, for otherwise the description would not\r\nhold water. Such and such are the data: everything incompatible with\r\nthose data has to go by the board. It follows that the novelist's touch\r\nargues, often logically, from a wrong premise: it takes what it likes\r\nand leaves the rest. The facts may be correct as far as they go but\r\nthere are too few of them: what the author says may be true and yet by\r\nno means the truth. That is the novelist's touch. It falsifies life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, the novelist's touch as thus defined is, of course, bad in\r\nbiography, for no human being is simple. But in a novel it has its\r\nplace: a novel that is at all complex often requires flat people as well\r\nas round, and the outcome of their collisions parallels life more\r\naccurately than Mr. Douglas implies. The case of Dickens is significant.\r\nDickens' people are nearly all flat (Pip and David Copperfield attempt\r\nroundness, but so diffidently that they seem more like bubbles than\r\nsolids). Nearly every one can be summed up in a sentence, and yet there\r\nis this wonderful feeling of human depth. Probably the immense vitality\r\nof Dickens causes his characters to vibrate a little, so that they\r\nborrow his life and appear to lead one of their own. It is a conjuring\r\ntrick; at any moment we may look at Mr. Pickwick edgeways and find him\r\nno thicker than a gramophone record. But we never get the sideway view.\r\nMr. Pickwick is far too adroit and well trained. He always has the air\r\nof weighing something, and when he is put into the cupboard of the young\r\nladies' school he seems as heavy as Falstaff in the buck-basket at\r\nWindsor. Part of the genius of Dickens is that he does use types and\r\ncaricatures, people whom we recognize the instant they re-enter, and yet\r\nachieves effects that are not mechanical and a vision of humanity that\r\nis not shallow. Those who dislike Dickens have an excellent case. He\r\nought to be bad. He is actually one of our big writers, and his immense\r\nsuccess with types suggests that there may be more in flatness than the\r\nseverer critics admit.\r\n\r\nOr take H. G. Wells. With the possible exceptions of Kipps and the\r\naunt in _Tono Bungay_, all Wells' characters are as flat as a photograph.\r\nBut the photographs are agitated with such vigour that we forget their\r\ncomplexities lie on the surface and would disappear if it was scratched\r\nor curled up. A Wells character cannot indeed be summed up in a single\r\nphrase; he is tethered much more to observation, he does not create\r\ntypes. Nevertheless his people seldom pulsate by their own strength. It\r\nis the deft and powerful hands of their maker that shake them and trick\r\nthe reader into a sense of depth. Good but imperfect novelists, like\r\nWells and Dickens, are very clever at transmitting force. The part of\r\ntheir novel that is alive galvanizes the part that is not, and causes\r\nthe characters to jump about and speak in a convincing way. They are\r\nquite different from the perfect novelist who touches all his material\r\ndirectly, who seems to pass the creative finger down every sentence and\r\ninto every word. Richardson, Defoe, Jane Austen, are perfect in this\r\nparticular way; their work may not be great but their hands are always\r\nupon it; there is not the tiny interval between the touching of the\r\nbutton and the sound of the bell which occurs in novels where the\r\ncharacters are not under direct control.\r\n\r\nFor we must admit that flat people are not in themselves as big\r\nachievements as round ones, and also that they are best when they are\r\ncomic. A serious or tragic flat character is apt to be a bore. Each time\r\nhe enters crying \"Revenge!\" or \"My heart bleeds for humanity!\" or\r\nwhatever his formula is, our hearts sink. One of the romances of a\r\npopular contemporary writer is constructed round a Sussex farmer who\r\nsays, \"I'll plough up that bit of gorse.\" There is the farmer, there is\r\nthe gorse; he says he'll plough it up, he does plough it up, but it is\r\nnot like saying \"I'll never desert Mr. Micawber,\" because we are so\r\nbored by his consistency that we do not care whether he succeeds with\r\nthe gorse or fails. If his formula was analysed and connected up with\r\nthe rest of the human outfit, we should not be bored any longer, the\r\nformula would cease to be the man and become an obsession in the man;\r\nthat is to say he would have turned from a flat farmer into a round one.\r\nIt is only round people who are fit to perform tragically for any length\r\nof time and can move us to any feelings except humour and\r\nappropriateness.\r\n\r\nSo now let us desert these two-dimensional people, and by way of\r\ntransition to the round, let us go to _Mansfield Park_, and look at\r\nLady Bertram, sitting on her sofa with pug. Pug is flat, like most\r\nanimals in fiction. He is once represented as straying into a rose-bed\r\nin a cardboard kind of way, but that is all, and during most of the\r\nbook his mistress seems to be cut out of the same simple material as\r\nher dog. Lady Bertram's formula is, \"I am kindly, but must not be\r\nfatigued,\" and she functions out of it. But at the end there is a\r\ncatastrophe. Her two daughters come to grief--to the worst grief known\r\nto Miss Austen's universe, far worse than the Napoleonic wars. Julia\r\nelopes; Maria, who is unhappily married, runs off with a lover. What\r\nis Lady Bertram's reaction? The sentence describing it is significant:\r\n\"Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but, guided by Sir Thomas, she\r\nthought justly on all important points, and she saw therefore in all\r\nits enormity, what had happened, and neither endeavoured herself, nor\r\nrequired Fanny to advise her, to think little of guilt and infamy.\"\r\nThese are strong words, and they used to worry me because I thought\r\nJane Austen's moral sense was getting out of hand. She may, and of\r\ncourse does, deprecate guilt and infamy herself, and she duly causes\r\nall possible distress in the minds of Edmund and Fanny, but has she any\r\nright to agitate calm, consistent Lady Bertram? Is not it like giving\r\npug three faces and setting him to guard the gates of Hell? Ought not\r\nher ladyship to remain on the sofa saying, \"This is a dreadful and\r\nsadly exhausting business about Julia and Maria, but where is Fanny\r\ngone? I have dropped another stitch\"?\r\n\r\nI used to think this, through misunderstanding Jane Austen's\r\nmethod--exactly as Scott misunderstood it when he congratulated her for\r\npainting on a square of ivory. She is a miniaturist, but never\r\ntwo-dimensional. All her characters are round, or capable of rotundity.\r\nEven Miss Bates has a mind, even Elizabeth Eliot a heart, and Lady\r\nBertram's moral fervour ceases to vex us when we realize this: the disk\r\nhas suddenly extended and become a little globe. When the novel is\r\nclosed, Lady Bertram goes back to the flat, it is true; the dominant\r\nimpression she leaves can be summed up in a formula. But that is not how\r\nJane Austen conceived her, and the freshness of her reappearances are\r\ndue to this. Why do the characters in Jane Austen give us a slightly new\r\npleasure each time they come in, as opposed to the merely repetitive\r\npleasure that is caused by a character in Dickens? Why do they combine\r\nso well in a conversation, and draw one another out without seeming to\r\ndo so, and never perform? The answer to this question can be put in\r\nseveral ways: that, unlike Dickens, she was a real artist, that she\r\nnever stooped to caricature, etc. But the best reply is that her\r\ncharacters though smaller than his are more highly organized. They\r\nfunction all round, and even if her plot made greater demands on them\r\nthan it does, they would still be adequate. Suppose that Louisa Musgrove\r\nhad broken her neck on the Cobb. The description of her death would have\r\nbeen feeble and ladylike--physical violence is quite beyond Miss\r\nAusten's powers--but the survivors would have reacted properly as soon\r\nas the corpse was carried away, they would have brought into view new\r\nsides of their character, and though _Persuasion_ would have been\r\nspoiled as a book, we should know more than we do about Captain\r\nWentworth and Anne. All the Jane Austen characters are ready for an\r\nextended life, for a life which the scheme of her books seldom requires\r\nthem to lead, and that is why they lead their actual lives so\r\nsatisfactorily. Let us return to Lady Bertram and the crucial sentence.\r\nSee how subtly it modulates from her formula into an area where the\r\nformula does not work. \"Lady Bertram did not think deeply.\" Exactly: as\r\nper formula. \"But guided by Sir Thomas she thought justly on all\r\nimportant points.\" Sir Thomas' guidance, which is part of the formula,\r\nremains, but it pushes her ladyship towards an independent and undesired\r\nmorality. \"She saw therefore in all its enormity what had happened.\"\r\nThis is the moral fortissimo--very strong but carefully introduced. And\r\nthen follows a most artful decrescendo, by means of negatives. \"She\r\nneither endeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her, to think\r\nlittle of guilt or infamy.\" The formula is reappearing, because as a\r\nrule she does try to minimize trouble, and does require Fanny to advise\r\nher how to do this; indeed Fanny has done nothing else for the last ten\r\nyears. The words, though they are negatived, remind us of this, her\r\nnormal state is again in view, and she has in a single sentence been\r\ninflated into a round character and collapsed back into a flat one. How\r\nJane Austen can write! In a few words she has extended Lady Bertram, and\r\nby so doing she has increased the probability of the elopements of Maria\r\nand Julia. I say probability because the elopements belong to the domain\r\nof violent physical action, and here, as already indicated, Jane Austen\r\nis feeble and ladylike. Except in her school-girl novels, she cannot\r\nstage a crash. Everything violent has to take place \"off\"--Louisa's\r\naccident and Marianne Dashwood's putrid throat are the nearest\r\nexceptions--and consequently all the comments on the elopement must be\r\nsincere and convincing, otherwise we should doubt whether it occurred.\r\nLady Bertram helps us to believe that her daughters have run away, and\r\nthey have to run away, or there would be no apotheosis for Fanny. It is\r\na little point, and a little sentence, yet it shows us how delicately a\r\ngreat novelist can modulate into the round.\r\n\r\nAll through her works we find these characters, apparently so simple and\r\nflat, never needing reintroduction and yet never out of their\r\ndepth--Henry Tilney, Mr. Woodhouse, Charlotte Lucas. She may label her\r\ncharacters \"Sense,\" \"Pride,\" \"Sensibility,\" \"Prejudice,\" but they are\r\nnot tethered to those qualities.\r\n\r\nAs for the round characters proper, they have already been defined by\r\nimplication and no more need be said. All I need do is to give some\r\nexamples of people in books who seem to me round so that the definition\r\ncan be tested afterwards:\r\n\r\nAll the principal characters in _War and Peace_, all the Dostoevsky\r\ncharacters, and some of the Proust--for example, the old family servant,\r\nthe Duchess of Guermantes, M. de Charlus, and Saint Loup; Madame\r\nBovary--who, like Moll Flanders, has her book to herself, and can expand\r\nand secrete unchecked; some people in Thackeray--for instance, Becky and\r\nBeatrix; some in Fielding--Parson Adams, Tom Jones; and some in\r\nCharlotte Brontë, most particularly Lucy Snowe. (And many more--this is\r\nnot a catalogue.) The test of a round character is whether it is capable\r\nof surprising in a convincing way. If it never surprises, it is flat. If\r\nit does not convince, it is a flat pretending to be round. It has the\r\nincalculability of life about it--life within the pages of a book. And\r\nby using it sometimes alone, more often in combination with the other\r\nkind, the novelist achieves his task of acclimatization and harmonizes\r\nthe human race with the other aspects of his work.\r\n\r\nii. Now for the second device: the point of view from which the story\r\nmay be told.\r\n\r\nTo some critics this is the fundamental device of novel-writing. \"The\r\nwhole intricate question of method, in the craft of fiction,\" says Mr.\r\nPercy Lubbock, \"I take to be governed by the question of the _point of\r\nview_--the question of the relation in which the narrator stands to the\r\nstory.\" And his book _The Craft of Fiction_ examines various points of\r\nview with genius and insight. The novelist, he says, can either describe\r\nthe characters from outside, as an impartial or partial onlooker; or he\r\ncan assume omniscience and describe them from within; or he can place\r\nhimself in the position of one of them and affect to be in the dark as\r\nto the motives of the rest; or there are certain intermediate attitudes.\r\n\r\nThose who follow him will lay a sure foundation for the æsthetics of\r\nfiction--a foundation which I cannot for a moment promise. This is a\r\nramshackly survey and for me the \"whole intricate question of method\"\r\nresolves itself not into formulæ but into the power of the writer to\r\nbounce the reader into accepting what he says--a power which Mr. Lubbock\r\nadmits and admires, but locates at the edge of the problem instead of at\r\nthe centre. I should put it plumb in the centre. Look how Dickens\r\nbounces us in _Bleak House_. Chapter I of _Bleak House_ is omniscient.\r\nDickens takes us into the Court of Chancery and rapidly explains all the\r\npeople there. In Chapter II he is partially omniscient. We still use his\r\neyes, but for some unexplained reason they begin to grow weak: he can\r\nexplain Sir Leicester Dedlock to us, part of Lady Dedlock but not all,\r\nand nothing of Mr. Tulkinghorn. In Chapter III he is even more\r\nreprehensible: he goes straight across into the dramatic method and\r\ninhabits a young lady, Esther Summerson. \"I have a great deal of\r\ndifficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages, for I know I\r\nam not clever,\" pipes up Esther, and continues in this strain with\r\nconsistency and competence, so long as she is allowed to hold the pen.\r\nAt any moment the author of her being may snatch it from her, and run\r\nabout taking notes himself, leaving her seated goodness knows where, and\r\nemployed we do not care how. Logically, _Bleak House_ is all to pieces,\r\nbut Dickens bounces us, so that we do not mind the shiftings of the view\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nCritics are more apt to object than readers. Zealous for the novel's\r\neminence, they are a little too apt to look out for problems that shall\r\nbe peculiar to it, and differentiate it from the drama; they feel it\r\nought to have its own technical troubles before it can be accepted as an\r\nindependent art; and since the problem of a point of view certainly is\r\npeculiar to the novel they have rather overstressed it. I do not myself\r\nthink it is so important as a proper mixture of characters--a problem\r\nwhich the dramatist is up against also. And the novelist must bounce us;\r\nthat is imperative.\r\n\r\nLet us glance at two other examples of a shifting view point.\r\n\r\nThe eminent French writer, André Gide, has published a novel called\r\n_Les Faux Monnayeurs_[4]--for all its modernity, this novel of Gide's\r\nhas one aspect in common with _Bleak House_: it is all to pieces\r\nlogically. Sometimes the author is omniscient: he explains everything,\r\nhe stands back, \"il juge ses personnages\"; at other times his\r\nomniscience is partial; yet again he is dramatic, and causes the story\r\nto be told through the diary of one of the characters. There is the same\r\nabsence of view point, but whereas in Dickens it was instinctive, in\r\nGide it is sophisticated; he expatiates too much about the jolts. The\r\nnovelist who betrays too much interest in his own method can never be\r\nmore than interesting; he has given up the creation of character and\r\nsummoned us to help analyse his own mind, and a heavy drop in the\r\nemotional thermometer results. _Les Faux Monnayeurs_ is among the more\r\ninteresting of recent works: not among the vital: and greatly as we\r\nshall have to admire it as a fabric we cannot praise it unrestrictedly\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nFor our second example we must again glance at _War and Peace_. Here the\r\nresult is vital: we are bounced up and down Russia--omniscient,\r\nsemi-omniscient, dramatized here or there as the moment dictates--and at\r\nthe end we have accepted it all. Mr. Lubbock does not, it is true: great\r\nas he finds the book, he would find it greater if it had a view point;\r\nhe feels Tolstoy has not pulled his full weight. I feel that the rules\r\nof the game of writing are not like this. A novelist can shift his view\r\npoint if it comes off, and it came off with Dickens and Tolstoy. Indeed\r\nthis power to expand and contract perception (of which the shifting view\r\npoint is a symptom), this right to intermittent knowledge:--I find it\r\none of the great advantages of the novel-form, and it has a parallel in\r\nour perception of life. We are stupider at some times than others; we\r\ncan enter into people's minds occasionally but not always, because our\r\nown minds get tired; and this intermittence lends in the long run\r\nvariety and colour to the experiences we receive. A quantity of\r\nnovelists, English novelists especially, have behaved like this to the\r\npeople in their books: played fast and loose with them, and I cannot see\r\nwhy they should be censured.\r\n\r\nThey must be censured if we catch them at it at the time. That is quite\r\ntrue, and out of it arises another question: may the writer take the\r\nreader into his confidence about his characters? Answer has already been\r\nindicated: better not. It is dangerous, it generally leads to a drop in\r\nthe temperature, to intellectual and emotional laxity, and worse still\r\nto facetiousness, and to a friendly invitation to see how the figures\r\nhook up behind. \"Doesn't A look nice--she always was my favourite.\"\r\n\"Let's think of why B does that--perhaps there's more in him than meets\r\nthe eye--yes, see--he has a heart of gold--having given you this peep at\r\nit I'll pop it back--I don't think he's noticed.\" \"And C--he always was\r\nthe mystery man.\" Intimacy is gained but at the expense of illusion and\r\nnobility. It is like standing a man a drink so that he may not criticize\r\nyour opinions. With all respect to Fielding and Thackeray it is\r\ndevastating, it is bar-parlour chattiness, and nothing has been more\r\nharmful to the novels of the past. To take your reader into your\r\nconfidence about the universe is a different thing. It is not dangerous\r\nfor a novelist to draw back from his characters, as Hardy and Conrad do,\r\nand to generalize about the conditions under which he thinks life is\r\ncarried on. It is confidences about the individual people that do harm,\r\nand beckon the reader away from the people to an examination of the\r\nnovelist's mind. Not much is ever found in it at such a moment, for it\r\nis never in the creative state: the mere process of saying, \"Come along,\r\nlet's have a chat,\" has cooled it down.\r\n\r\nOur comments on human beings must now come to an end. They may take\r\nfuller shape when we come to discuss the plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Translated by Dorothy Bussy as _The Counterfeiters_\r\n(Knopf).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE PLOT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CHARACTER,\" says Aristotle, \"gives us qualities, but it is in\r\nactions--what we do--that we are happy or the reverse.\" We have already\r\ndecided that Aristotle is wrong and now we must face the consequences of\r\ndisagreeing with him. \"All human happiness and misery,\" says Aristotle,\r\n\"take the form of action.\" We know better. We believe that happiness and\r\nmisery exist in the secret life, which each of us leads privately and to\r\nwhich (in his characters) the novelist has access. And by the secret\r\nlife we mean the life for which there is no external evidence, not, as\r\nis vulgarly supposed, that which is revealed by a chance word or a sigh.\r\nA chance word or sigh are just as much evidence as a speech or a murder:\r\nthe life they reveal ceases to be secret and enters the realm of action.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, no occasion to be hard on Aristotle. He had read few\r\nnovels and no modern ones--the _Odyssey_ but not _Ulysses_--he was by\r\ntemperament apathetic to secrecy, and indeed regarded the human mind as\r\na sort of tub from which everything can finally be extracted; and when\r\nhe wrote the words quoted above he had in view the drama, where no doubt\r\nthey hold true. In the drama all human happiness and misery does and\r\nmust take the form of action. Otherwise its existence remains unknown,\r\nand this is the great difference between the drama and the novel.\r\n\r\nThe speciality of the novel is that the writer can talk about his\r\ncharacters as well as through them or can arrange for us to listen when\r\nthey talk to themselves. He has access to self-communings, and from that\r\nlevel he can descend even deeper and peer into the subconscious. A man\r\ndoes not talk to himself quite truly--not even to himself; the happiness\r\nor misery that he secretly feels proceed from causes that he cannot\r\nquite explain, because as soon as he raises them to the level of the\r\nexplicable they lose their native quality. The novelist has a real pull\r\nhere. He can show the subconscious short-circuiting straight into action\r\n(the dramatist can do this too); he can also show it in its relation to\r\nsoliloquy. He commands all the secret life, and he must not be robbed of\r\nthis privilege. \"How did the writer know that?\" it is sometimes said.\r\n\"What's his standpoint? He is not being consistent, he's shifting his\r\npoint of view from the limited to the omniscient, and now he's edging\r\nback again.\" Questions like these have too much the atmosphere of the\r\nlaw courts about them. All that matters to the reader is whether the\r\nshifting of attitude and the secret life are convincing, whether it is\r\n_πιθανόν_ in fact, and with his favourite word ringing in his\r\nears Aristotle may retire.\r\n\r\nHowever, he leaves us in some confusion, for what, with this enlargement\r\nof human nature, is going to become of the plot? In most literary works\r\nthere are two elements: human individuals, whom we have recently\r\ndiscussed, and the element vaguely called art. Art we have also dallied\r\nwith, but with a very low form of it: the story: the chopped-off length\r\nof the tapeworm of time. Now we arrive at a much higher aspect: the\r\nplot, and the plot, instead of finding human beings more or less cut to\r\nits requirements, as they are in the drama, finds them enormous, shadowy\r\nand intractable, and three-quarters hidden like an iceberg. In vain it\r\npoints out to these unwieldy creatures the advantages of the triple\r\nprocess of complication, crisis, and solution so persuasively expounded\r\nby Aristotle. A few of them rise and comply, and a novel which ought to\r\nhave been a play is the result. But there is no general response. They\r\nwant to sit apart and brood or something, and the plot (whom I here\r\nvisualize as a sort of higher government official) is concerned at their\r\nlack of public spirit: \"This will not do,\" it seems to say.\r\n\"Individualism is a most valuable quality; indeed my own position\r\ndepends upon individuals; I have always admitted as much freely.\r\nNevertheless there are certain limits, and those limits are being\r\noverstepped. Characters must not brood too long, they must not waste\r\ntime running up and down ladders in their own insides, they must\r\ncontribute, or higher interests will be jeopardised.\" How well one knows\r\nthat phrase, \"a contribution to the plot\"! It is accorded, and of\r\nnecessity, by the people in a drama: how necessary is it in a novel?\r\n\r\nLet us define a plot. We have defined a story as a narrative of events\r\narranged in their time-sequence. A plot is also a narrative of events,\r\nthe emphasis falling on causality. \"The king died and then the queen\r\ndied,\" is a story. \"The king died, and then the queen died of grief\" is\r\na plot. The time-sequence is preserved, but the sense of causality\r\novershadows it. Or again: \"The queen died, no one knew why, until it was\r\ndiscovered that it was through grief at the death of the king.\" This is\r\na plot with a mystery in it, a form capable of high development. It\r\nsuspends the time-sequence, it moves as far away from the story as its\r\nlimitations will allow. Consider the death of the queen. If it is in a\r\nstory we say \"and then?\" If it is in a plot we ask \"why?\" That is the\r\nfundamental difference between these two aspects of the novel. A plot\r\ncannot be told to a gaping audience of cave men or to a tyrannical\r\nsultan or to their modern descendant the movie-public. They can only be\r\nkept awake by \"and then--and then----\" They can only supply curiosity.\r\nBut a plot demands intelligence and memory also.\r\n\r\nCuriosity is one of the lowest of the human faculties. You will have\r\nnoticed in daily life that when people are inquisitive they nearly\r\nalways have bad memories and are usually stupid at bottom. The man who\r\nbegins by asking you how many brothers and sisters you have, is never a\r\nsympathetic character, and if you meet him in a year's time he will\r\nprobably ask you how many brothers and sisters you have, his mouth again\r\nsagging open, his eyes still bulging from his head. It is difficult to\r\nbe friends with such a man, and for two inquisitive people to be friends\r\nmust be impossible. Curiosity by itself takes us a very little way, nor\r\ndoes it take us far into the novel--only as far as the story. If we\r\nwould grasp the plot we must add intelligence and memory.\r\n\r\nIntelligence first. The intelligent novel-reader, unlike the inquisitive\r\none who just runs his eye over a new fact, mentally picks it up. He sees\r\nit from two points of view: isolated, and related to the other facts\r\nthat he has read on previous pages. Probably he does not understand it,\r\nbut he does not expect to do so yet awhile. The facts in a highly\r\norganized novel (like _The Egoist_) are often of the nature of\r\ncross-correspondences and the ideal spectator cannot expect to view them\r\nproperly until he is sitting up on a hill at the end. This element of\r\nsurprise or mystery--the detective element as it is sometimes rather\r\nemptily called--is of great importance in a plot. It occurs through a\r\nsuspension of the time-sequence; a mystery is a pocket in time, and it\r\noccurs crudely, as in \"Why did the queen die?\" and more subtly in\r\nhalf-explained gestures and words, the true meaning of which only dawns\r\npages ahead. Mystery is essential to a plot, and cannot be appreciated\r\nwithout intelligence. To the curious it is just another \"and then----\"\r\nTo appreciate a mystery, part of the mind must be left behind, brooding,\r\nwhile the other part goes marching on.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to our second qualification: memory.\r\n\r\nMemory and intelligence are closely connected, for unless we remember we\r\ncannot understand. If by the time the queen dies we have forgotten the\r\nexistence of the king we shall never make out what killed her. The\r\nplot-maker expects us to remember, we expect him to leave no loose ends.\r\nEvery action or word ought to count; it ought to be economical and\r\nspare; even when complicated it should be organic and free from dead\r\nmatter. It may be difficult or easy, it may and should contain\r\nmysteries, but it ought not to mislead. And over it, as it unfolds, will\r\nhover the memory of the reader (that dull glow of the mind of which\r\nintelligence is the bright advancing edge) and will constantly rearrange\r\nand reconsider, seeing new clues, new chains of cause and effect, and\r\nthe final sense (if the plot has been a fine one) will not be of clues\r\nor chains, but of something æsthetically compact, something which might\r\nhave been shown by the novelist straight away, only if he had shown it\r\nstraight away it would never have become beautiful. We come up against\r\nbeauty here--for the first time in our enquiry: beauty at which a\r\nnovelist should never aim, though he fails if he does not achieve it. I\r\nwill conduct beauty to her proper place later on. Meanwhile please\r\naccept her as part of a completed plot. She looks a little surprised at\r\nbeing there, but beauty ought to look a little surprised: it is the\r\nemotion that best suits her face, as Botticelli knew when he painted her\r\nrisen from the waves, between the winds and the flowers. The beauty who\r\ndoes not look surprised, who accepts her position as her due--she\r\nreminds us too much of a prima donna.\r\n\r\nBut let us get back to the plot, and we will do so via George Meredith.\r\n\r\nMeredith is not the great name he was twenty or thirty years ago, when\r\nmuch of the universe and all Cambridge trembled. I remember how\r\ndepressed I used to be by a line in one of his poems: \"We live but to be\r\nsword or block.\" I did not want to be either and I knew that I was not a\r\nsword. It seems though that there was no real cause for depression, for\r\nMeredith is himself now rather in the trough of a wave, and though\r\nfashion will turn and raise him a bit, he will never be the spiritual\r\npower he was about the year 1900. His philosophy has not worn well. His\r\nheavy attacks on sentimentality--they bore the present generation, which\r\npursues the same quarry but with neater instruments, and is apt to\r\nsuspect any one carrying a blunderbuss of being a sentimentalist\r\nhimself. And his visions of Nature--they do not endure like Hardy's,\r\nthere is too much Surrey about them, they are fluffy and lush. He could\r\nno more write the opening chapter of _The Return of the Native_ than Box\r\nHill could visit Salisbury Plain. What is really tragic and enduring in\r\nthe scenery of England was hidden from him, and so is what is really\r\ntragic in life. When he gets serious and noble-minded there is a\r\nstrident overtone, a bullying that becomes distressing. I feel indeed\r\nthat he was like Tennyson in one respect: through not taking himself\r\nquietly enough he strained his inside. And his novels: most of the\r\nsocial values are faked. The tailors are not tailors, the cricket\r\nmatches are not cricket, the railway trains do not even seem to be\r\ntrains, the county families give the air of having been only just that\r\nmoment unpacked, scarcely in position before the action starts, the\r\nstraw still clinging to their beards. It is surely very odd, the social\r\nscene in which his characters are set: it is partly due to his fantasy,\r\nwhich is legitimate, but partly a chilly fake, and wrong. What with the\r\nfaking, what with the preaching, which was never agreeable and is now\r\nsaid to be hollow, and what with the home counties posing as the\r\nuniverse, it is no wonder Meredith now lies in the trough. And yet he is\r\nin one way a great novelist. He is the finest contriver that English\r\nfiction has ever produced, and any lecture on plot must do homage to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMeredith's plots are not closely knit. We cannot describe the action of\r\n_Harry Richmond_ in a phrase, as we can that of _Great Expectations_,\r\nthough both books turn on the mistake made by a young man as to the\r\nsources of his fortune. A Meredithian plot is not a temple to the tragic\r\nor even to the comic Muse, but rather resembles a series of kiosks most\r\nartfully placed among wooded slopes, which his people reach by their own\r\nimpetus, and from which they emerge with altered aspect. Incident\r\nsprings out of character, and having occurred it alters that character.\r\nPeople and events are closely connected, and he does it by means of\r\nthese contrivances. They are often delightful, sometimes touching,\r\nalways unexpected. This shock, followed by the feeling, \"Oh, that's all\r\nright,\" is a sign that all is well with the plot: characters, to be\r\nreal, ought to run smoothly, but a plot ought to cause surprise. The\r\nhorse-whipping of Dr. Shrapnel in _Beauchamp's Career_ is a surprise. We\r\nknow that Everard Romfrey must dislike Shrapnel, must hate and\r\nmisunderstand his radicalism, and be jealous of his influence over\r\nBeauchamp: we watch too the growth of the misunderstanding over\r\nRosamund, we watch the intrigues of Cecil Baskelett. As far as\r\ncharacters go, Meredith plays with his cards on the table, but when the\r\nincident comes what a shock it gives us and the characters too! The\r\ntragicomic business of one old man whipping another from the highest\r\nmotives--it reacts upon all their world, and transforms all the\r\npersonages of the book. It is not the centre of _Beauchamp's Career_,\r\nwhich indeed has no centre. It is essentially a contrivance, a door\r\nthrough which the book is made to pass, emerging in an altered form.\r\nTowards the close, when Beauchamp is drowned and Shrapnel and Romfrey\r\nare reconciled over his body, there is an attempt to elevate the plot to\r\nAristotelian symmetry, to turn the novel into a temple wherein dwells\r\ninterpretation and peace. Meredith fails here: _Beauchamp's Career_\r\nremains a series of contrivances (the visit to France is another of\r\nthem), but contrivances that spring from the characters and react upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd now briefly to illustrate the mystery element in the plot: the\r\nformula of \"The queen died, it was afterwards discovered through grief.\"\r\nI will take an example, not from Dickens (though _Great Expectations_\r\nprovides a fine one), nor from Conan Doyle (whom my priggishness\r\nprevents me from enjoying), but again from Meredith: an example of a\r\nconcealed emotion from the admirable plot of _The Egoist_: it occurs in\r\nthe character of Laetitia Dale.\r\n\r\nWe are told, at first, all that passes in Laetitia's mind. Sir\r\nWilloughby has twice jilted her, she is sad, resigned. Then, for\r\ndramatic reasons, her mind is hidden from us, it develops naturally\r\nenough, but does not re-emerge until the great midnight scene where he\r\nasks her to marry him because he is not sure about Clara, and this time,\r\na changed woman, Laetitia says \"No.\" Meredith has concealed the change.\r\nIt would have spoiled his high comedy if we had been kept in touch with\r\nit throughout. Sir Willoughby has to have a series of crashes, to catch\r\nat this and that, and find everything rickety. We should not enjoy the\r\nfun, in fact it would be boorish, if we saw the author preparing the\r\nbooby traps beforehand, so Laetitia's apathy has been hidden from us.\r\nThis is one of the countless examples in which either plot or character\r\nhas to suffer, and Meredith with his unerring good sense here lets the\r\nplot triumph.\r\n\r\nAs an example of mistaken triumph, I think of a slip--it is no more than\r\na slip--which Charlotte Brontë makes in _Villette_. She allows Lucy\r\nSnowe to conceal from the reader her discovery that Dr. John is the same\r\nas her old playmate Graham. When it comes out, we do get a good plot\r\nthrill, but too much at the expense of Lucy's character. She has seemed,\r\nup to then, the spirit of integrity, and has, as it were, laid herself\r\nunder a moral obligation to narrate all that she knows. That she stoops\r\nto suppress is a little distressing, though the incident is too trivial\r\nto do her any permanent harm.\r\n\r\nSometimes a plot triumphs too completely. The characters have to suspend\r\ntheir natures at every turn, or else are so swept away by the course of\r\nFate that our sense of their reality is weakened. We shall find\r\ninstances of this in a writer who is far greater than Meredith, and yet\r\nless successful as a novelist--Thomas Hardy. Hardy seems to me\r\nessentially a poet, who conceives of his novels from an enormous height.\r\nThey are to be tragedies or tragi-comedies, they are to give out the\r\nsound of hammer-strokes as they proceed; in other words Hardy arranges\r\nevents with emphasis on causality, the ground plan is a plot, and the\r\ncharacters are ordered to acquiesce in its requirements. Except in the\r\nperson of Tess (who conveys the feeling that she is greater than\r\ndestiny) this aspect of his work is unsatisfactory. His characters are\r\ninvolved in various snares, they are finally bound hand and foot, there\r\nis ceaseless emphasis on fate, and yet, for all the sacrifices made to\r\nit, we never see the action as a living thing as we see it in _Antigone_\r\nor _Berenice_ or _The Cherry Orchard_. The fate above us, not the fate\r\nworking through us--that is what is eminent and memorable in the Wessex\r\nnovels. Egdon Heath before Eustada Vye has set foot upon it. The woods\r\nwithout the Woodlanders. The downs above Budmouth Regis with the royal\r\nprincesses, still asleep, driving across them through the dawn. Hardy's\r\nsuccess in _The Dynasts_ (where he uses another medium) is complete,\r\nthere the hammer-strokes are heard, cause and effect enchain the\r\ncharacters despite their struggles, complete contact between the actors\r\nand the plot is established. But in the novels, though the same superb\r\nand terrible machine works, it never catches humanity in its teeth;\r\nthere is some vital problem that has not been answered, or even posed,\r\nin the misfortunes of Jude the Obscure. In other words the characters\r\nhave been required to contribute too much to the plot; except in their\r\nrustic humours, their vitality has been impoverished, they have gone dry\r\nand thin. This, as far as I can make out, is the flaw running through\r\nHardy's novels: he has emphasized causality more strongly than his\r\nmedium permits. As a poet and prophet and visualizer George Meredith is\r\nnothing by his side--just a suburban roarer--but Meredith did know what\r\nthe novel could stand, where the plot could dun the characters for a\r\ncontribution, where it must let them function as they liked. And the\r\nmoral--well, I see no moral, because the work of Hardy is my home and\r\nthat of Meredith cannot be: still the moral from the point of these\r\nlectures is again unfavourable to Aristotle. In the novel, all human\r\nhappiness and misery does not take the form of action, it seeks means of\r\nexpression other than through the plot, it must not be rigidly\r\ncanalized.\r\n\r\nIn the losing battle that the plot fights with the characters, it often\r\ntakes a cowardly revenge. Nearly all novels are feeble at the end. This\r\nis because the plot requires to be wound up. Why is this necessary? Why\r\nis there not a convention which allows a novelist to stop as soon as he\r\nfeels muddled or bored? Alas, he has to round things off, and usually\r\nthe characters go dead while he is at work, and our final impression of\r\nthem is through deadness. _The Vicar of Wakefield_ is in this way a\r\ntypical novel, so clever and fresh in the first half, up to the painting\r\nof the family group with Mrs. Primrose as Venus, and then so wooden and\r\nimbecile. Incidents and people that occurred at first for their own sake\r\nnow have to contribute to the dénouement. In the end even the author\r\nfeels he is being a little foolish. \"Nor can I go on,\" he says, \"without\r\na reflection on those accidental meetings which, though they happen\r\nevery day, seldom excite our surprise but upon some extraordinary\r\noccasion.\" Goldsmith is of course a light-weight, but most novels do\r\nfail here--there is this disastrous standstill while logic takes over\r\nthe command from flesh and blood. If it was not for death and marriage\r\nI do not know how the average novelist would conclude. Death and\r\nmarriage are almost his only connection between his characters and his\r\nplot, and the reader is more ready to meet him here, and take a bookish\r\nview of them, provided they occur later on in the book: the writer, poor\r\nfellow, must be allowed to finish up somehow, he has his living to get\r\nlike any one else, so no wonder that nothing is heard but hammering and\r\nscrewing.\r\n\r\nThis--as far as one can generalize--is the inherent defect of novels:\r\nthey go off at the end: and there are two explanations of it: firstly,\r\nfailure of pep, which threatens the novelist like all workers: and\r\nsecondly, the difficulty which we have been discussing. The characters\r\nhave been getting out of hand, laying foundations and declining to build\r\non them afterwards, and now the novelist has to labour personally, in\r\norder that the job may be done to time. He pretends that the characters\r\nare acting for him. He keeps mentioning their names and using inverted\r\ncommas. But the characters are gone or dead.\r\n\r\nThe plot, then, is the novel in its logical intellectual aspect: it\r\nrequires mystery, but the mysteries are solved later on: the reader may\r\nbe moving about in worlds unrealized, but the novelist has no\r\nmisgivings. He is competent, poised above his work, throwing a beam of\r\nlight here, popping on a cap of invisibility there, and (qua plot-maker)\r\ncontinually negotiating with himself qua character-monger as to the best\r\neffect to be produced. He plans his book beforehand: or anyhow he stands\r\nabove it, his interest in cause and effect give him an air of\r\npredetermination.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must ask ourselves whether the framework thus produced is the\r\nbest possible for a novel. After all, why has a novel to be planned?\r\nCannot it grow? Why need it close, as a play closes? Cannot it open out?\r\nInstead of standing above his work and controlling it, cannot the\r\nnovelist throw himself into it and be carried along to some goal that he\r\ndoes not foresee? The plot is exciting and may be beautiful, yet is it\r\nnot a fetich, borrowed from the drama, from the spatial limitations of\r\nthe stage? Cannot fiction devise a framework that is not so logical yet\r\nmore suitable to its genius?\r\n\r\nModern writers say that it can, and we will now examine a recent\r\nexample--a violent onslaught on the plot as we have defined it: a\r\nconstructive attempt to put something in the place of the plot.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the novel in question: _Les Faux Monnayeurs_ by\r\nAndré Gide. It contains within its covers both the methods. Gide has\r\nalso published the diary he kept while he was writing the novel, and\r\nthere is no reason why he should not publish in the future the\r\nimpressions he had when rereading both the diary and the novel, and in\r\nthe future-perfect a still more final synthesis in which the diary, the\r\nnovel, and his impressions of both will interact. He is indeed a little\r\nmore solemn than an author should be about the whole caboodle, but\r\nregarded as a caboodle it is excessively interesting, and repays careful\r\nstudy by critics.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the first place, a plot in _Les Faux Monnayeurs_ of the\r\nlogical objective type that we have been considering--a plot, or rather\r\nfragments of plots. The main fragment concerns a young man called\r\nOlivier--a charming, touching and lovable character, who misses\r\nhappiness, and then recovers it after an excellently contrived\r\ndénouement; confers it also; this fragment has a wonderful radiance and\r\n\"lives,\" if I may use so coarse a word, it is a successful creation on\r\nfamiliar lines. But it is by no means the centre of the book. No more\r\nare the other logical fragments--that which concerns Georges, Olivier's\r\nschoolboy brother, who passes false coin, and is instrumental in driving\r\na fellow-pupil to suicide. (Gide gives us his sources for all this in\r\nhis diary, he got the idea of Georges from a boy whom he caught trying\r\nto steal a book off a stall, the gang of coiners were caught at Rouen,\r\nand the suicide of children took place at Clermont-Ferrand, etc.)\r\nNeither Olivier, nor Georges, nor Vincent a third brother, nor Bernard\r\ntheir friend is the centre of the book. We come nearer to it in Edouard.\r\nEdouard is a novelist. He bears the same relation to Gide as Clissold\r\ndoes to Wells. I dare not be more precise. Like Gide, he keeps a diary,\r\nlike Gide he is writing a book called _Les Faux Monnayeurs_, and like\r\nClissold he is disavowed. Edouard's diary is printed in full. It begins\r\nbefore the plot-fragments, continues during them, and forms the bulk of\r\nGide's book. Edouard is not just a chronicler. He is an actor too;\r\nindeed it is he who rescues Olivier and is rescued by him; we leave\r\nthose two in happiness.\r\n\r\nBut that is still not the centre. The nearest to the centre lies in a\r\ndiscussion about the art of the novel. Edouard is holding forth to\r\nBernard his secretary and some friends. He has said (what we all accept\r\nas commonplace) that truth in life and truth in a novel are not\r\nidentical, and then he goes on to say that he wants to write a book\r\nwhich shall include both sorts of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And what is its subject?\" asked Sophroniska.\r\n\r\n\"There is none,\" said Edouard sharply. \"My novel has no subject. No\r\ndoubt that sounds foolish. Let us say, if you prefer, that it will not\r\nhave 'a' subject.... 'A slice of life,' the naturalistic school used to\r\nsay. The mistake that school made was always to cut its slice in the\r\nsame direction, always lengthwise, in the direction of time. Why not cut\r\nit up and down? Or across? As for me, I don't want to cut it at all. You\r\nsee what I mean. I want to put everything into my novel and not snip off\r\nmy material either here or there. I have been working for a year, and\r\nthere is nothing I haven't put in: all I see, all I know, all I can\r\nlearn from other people's lives and my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor man, you will bore your readers to death,\" cried Layra, unable\r\nto restrain her mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. To get my effect, I am inventing, as my central character,\r\na novelist, and the subject of my book will be the struggle between what\r\nreality offers him and what he tries to make of the offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you planned out this book?\" asked Sophroniska, trying to keep\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why 'of course'?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a book of this type any plan would be unsuitable. The whole of it\r\nwould go wrong if I decided any detail ahead. I am waiting for reality\r\nto dictate to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you wanted to get away from reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"My novelist wants to get away, but I keep pulling him back. To tell the\r\ntruth, this is my subject: the struggle between facts as proposed by\r\nreality, and the ideal reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do tell us the name of this book,\" said Laura, in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. Tell it them, Bernard.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Les Faux Monnayeurs_\" said Bernard. \"And now will you please tell us\r\nwho these faux monnayeurs are.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the least idea.\"\r\n\r\nBernard and Laura looked at each other and then at Sophroniska. There\r\nwas the sound of a deep sigh.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that ideas about money, depreciation, inflation, forgery,\r\netc., had gradually invaded Edouard's book--just as theories of clothing\r\ninvade _Sartor Resartus_ and even assume the functions of characters.\r\n\"Has any of you ever had hold of a false coin?\" he asked after a pause.\r\n\"Imagine a ten-franc piece, gold, false. It is actually worth a couple\r\nof sous, but it will remain worth ten francs until it is found out.\r\nSuppose I begin with the idea that----\"\r\n\r\n\"But why begin with an idea?\" burst out Bernard, who was by now in a\r\nstate of exasperation. \"Why not begin with a fact? If you introduce the\r\nfact properly, the idea will follow of itself. If I was writing your\r\n_Faux Monnayeurs_ I should begin with a piece of false money, with the\r\nten-franc piece you were speaking of, and here it is!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Bernard pulled a ten-franc piece out of his pocket and flung\r\nit on the table.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he remarked. \"It rings all right. I got it this morning from\r\nthe grocer. It's worth more than a couple of sous, as it's coated in\r\ngold, but it's actually made of glass. It will become quite transparent\r\nin time. No--don't rub it--you're going to spoil my false coin.\"\r\n\r\nEdouard had taken it and was examining it with the utmost attention.\r\n\r\n\"How did the grocer get it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't know. He passed it on me for a joke, and then enlightened\r\nme, being a decent fellow. He let me have it for five francs. I thought\r\nthat, since you were writing _Les Faux Monnayeurs_, you ought to see\r\nwhat false money is like, so I got it to show you. Now that you have\r\nlooked at it, give it me back. I am sorry to see that reality has no\r\ninterest for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Edouard: \"it interests me, but it puts me out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a pity,\" remarked Bernard.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis passage is the centre of the book. It contains the old thesis of\r\ntruth in life versus truth in art, and illustrates it very neatly by the\r\narrival of an actual false coin. What is new in it is the attempt to\r\ncombine the two truths, the proposal that writers should mix themselves\r\nup in their material and be rolled over and over by it; they should not\r\ntry to subdue any longer, they should hope to be subdued, to be carried\r\naway. As for a plot--to pot with the plot, break it up, boil it down.\r\nLet there be those \"formidable erosions of contour\" of which Nietzsche\r\nspeaks. All that is prearranged is false.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished critic has agreed with Gide--that old lady in the\r\nanecdote who was accused by her nieces of being illogical. For some time\r\nshe could not be brought to understand what logic was, and when she\r\ngrasped its true nature she was not so much angry as contemptuous.\r\n\"Logic! Good gracious! What rubbish!\" she exclaimed. \"How can I tell\r\nwhat I think till I see what I say?\" Her nieces, educated young women,\r\nthought that she was passée; she was really more up to date than they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThose who are in touch with contemporary France, say that the present\r\ngeneration follows the advice of Gide and the old lady and resolutely\r\nhurls itself into confusion, and indeed admires English novelists on the\r\nground that they so seldom succeed in what they attempt. Compliments are\r\nalways delightful, but this particular one is a bit of a backhander. It\r\nis like trying to lay an egg and being told you have produced a\r\nparaboloid--more curious than gratifying. And what results when you try\r\nto lay a paraboloid, I cannot conceive--perhaps the death of the hen.\r\nThat seems the danger in Gide's position--he sets out to lay a\r\nparaboloid; he is not well advised, if he wants to write subconscious\r\nnovels, to reason so lucidly and patiently about the subconscious; he is\r\nintroducing mysticism at the wrong stage of the process. However that is\r\nhis affair. As a critic he is most stimulating, and the various bundles\r\nof words he has called _Les Faux Monnayeurs_ will be enjoyed by all who\r\ncannot tell what they think till they see what they say, or who weary of\r\nthe tyranny by the plot and of its alternative, tyranny by characters.\r\n\r\nThere is clearly something else in view, some other aspect or aspects\r\nwhich we have yet to examine. We may suspect the claim to be consciously\r\nsubconscious, nevertheless there is a vague and vast residue into which\r\nthe subconscious enters. Poetry, religion, passion--we have not placed\r\nthem yet, and since we are critics—only critics--we must try to place\r\nthem, to catalogue the rainbow. We have already peeped and botanized\r\nupon our mothers' graves.\r\n\r\nThe numbering of the warp and woof of the rainbow must accordingly be\r\nattempted and we must now bring our minds to bear on the subject of\r\nfantasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Paraphrased from _Les Faux Monnayeurs_, pp. 238-246.\r\nMy version, needless to say, conveys neither the subtlety nor the\r\nbalance of the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFANTASY\r\n\r\n\r\nA course of lectures, if it is to be more than a collection of remarks,\r\nmust have an idea running through it. It must also have a subject, and\r\nthe idea ought to run through the subject too. This is so obvious as to\r\nsound foolish, but any one who has tried to lecture will realize that\r\nhere is a genuine difficulty. A course, like any other collection of\r\nwords, generates an atmosphere. It has its own apparatus--a lecturer, an\r\naudience or provision for one, it occurs at regular intervals, it is\r\nannounced by printed notices, and it has a financial side, though this\r\nlast is tactfully concealed. Thus it tends in its parasitic way to lead\r\na life of its own, and it and the idea running through it are apt to\r\nmove in one direction while the subject steals off in the other.\r\n\r\nThe idea running through these lectures is by now plain enough: that\r\nthere are in the novel two forces: human beings and a bundle of various\r\nthings not human beings, and that it is the novelist's business to\r\nadjust these two forces and conciliate their claims. That is plain\r\nenough, but does it run through the novel too? Perhaps our subject,\r\nnamely the books we have read, has stolen away from us while we\r\ntheorize, like a shadow from an ascending bird. The bird is all\r\nright--it climbs, it is consistent and eminent. The shadow is all\r\nright--it has flickered across roads and gardens. But the two things\r\nresemble one another less and less, they do not touch as they did when\r\nthe bird rested its toes on the ground. Criticism, especially a critical\r\ncourse, is so misleading. However lofty its intentions and sound its\r\nmethod, its subject slides away from beneath it, imperceptibly away, and\r\nlecturer and audience may awake with a start to find that they are\r\ncarrying on in a distinguished and intelligent manner, but in regions\r\nwhich have nothing to do with anything they have read.\r\n\r\nIt was this that was worrying Gide, or rather one of the things that was\r\nworrying him, for he has an anxious mind. When we try to translate truth\r\nout of one sphere into another, whether from life into books or from\r\nbooks into lectures, something happens to truth, it goes wrong, not\r\nsuddenly when it might be detected, but slowly. That long passage from\r\n_Les Faux Monnayeurs_ already quoted, may recall the bird to its shadow.\r\nIt is not possible, after it, to apply the old apparatus any more. There\r\nis more in the novel than time or people or logic or any of their\r\nderivatives, more even than Fate. And by \"more\" I do not mean something\r\nthat excludes these aspects nor something that includes them, embraces\r\nthem. I mean something that cuts across them like a bar of light, that\r\nis intimately connected with them at one place and patiently illumines\r\nall their problems, and at another place shoots over or through them as\r\nif they did not exist. We shall give that bar of light two names,\r\nfantasy and prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe novels we have now to consider all tell a story, contain characters,\r\nand have plots or bits of plots, so we could apply to them the apparatus\r\nsuited for Fielding or Arnold Bennett. But when I say two of their\r\nnames--_Tristram Shandy_ and _Moby Dick_--it is clear that we must stop\r\nand think a moment. The bird and the shadow are too far apart. A new\r\nformula must be found: the mere fact that one can mention Tristram and\r\nMoby in a single sentence shows it. What an impossible pair! As far\r\napart as the poles. Yes. And like the poles they have one thing in\r\ncommon, which the lands round the equator do not share: an axis. What is\r\nessential in Sterne and Melville belongs to this new aspect of fiction:\r\nthe fantastic-prophetical axis. George Meredith touched it: he was\r\nsomewhat fantastic. So did Charlotte Brontë: she was a prophetess\r\noccasionally. But in neither of these was it essential. Deprive them of\r\nit, and a book remains which still resembles _Harry Richmond_ or\r\n_Shirley_. Deprive Sterne or Melville of it, deprive Peacock or Max\r\nBeerbohm or Virginia Woolf or Walter de la Mare or William Beckford or\r\nJames Joyce or D. H. Lawrence or Swift, and nothing is left at all.\r\n\r\nOur easiest approach to a definition of any aspect of fiction is always\r\nby considering the sort of demand it makes on the reader. Curiosity for\r\nthe story, human feelings and a sense of value for the characters,\r\nintelligence and memory for the plot. What does fantasy ask of us? It\r\nasks us to pay something, extra. It compels us to an adjustment that is\r\ndifferent to an adjustment required by a work of art, to an additional\r\nadjustment. The other novelists say \"Here is something that might occur\r\nin your lives,\" the fantasist says \"Here's something that could not\r\noccur. I must ask you first to accept my book as a whole, and secondly\r\nto accept certain things in my book.\" Many readers can grant the first\r\nrequest, but refuse the second. \"One knows a book isn't real,\" they say,\r\n\"still one does expect it to be natural, and this angel or midget or\r\nghost or silly delay about the child's birth--no, it is too much.\" They\r\neither retract their original concession and stop reading, or if they do\r\ngo on it is with complete coldness, and they watch the gambols of the\r\nauthor without realizing how much they may mean to him.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the above approach is not critically sound. We all know that a\r\nwork of art is an entity, etc., etc.; it has its own laws which are not\r\nthose of daily life, anything that suits it is true, so why should any\r\nquestion arise about the angel, etc., except whether it is suitable to\r\nits book? Why place an angel on a different basis from a stockbroker?\r\nOnce in the realm of the fictitious, what difference is there between an\r\napparition and a mortgage? I see the soundness of this argument, but my\r\nheart refuses to assent. The general tone of novels is so literal that\r\nwhen the fantastic is introduced it produces a special effect: some\r\nreaders are thrilled, others choked off: it demands an additional\r\nadjustment because of the oddness of its method or subject matter--like\r\na sideshow in an exhibition where you have to pay sixpence as well as\r\nthe original entrance fee. Some readers pay with delight, it is only for\r\nthe sideshows that they entered the exhibition, and it is only to them I\r\ncan now speak. Others refuse with indignation, and these have our\r\nsincere regards, for to dislike the fantastic in literature is not to\r\ndislike literature. It does not even imply poverty of imagination, only\r\na disinclination to meet certain demands that are made on it. Mr.\r\nAsquith (if gossip is correct) could not meet the demands made on him by\r\n_Lady into Fox_. He should not have objected, he said, if the fox had\r\nbecome a lady again, but as it was he was left with an uncomfortable\r\ndissatisfied feeling. This feeling reflects no discredit either upon an\r\neminent politician or a charming book. It merely means that Mr. Asquith,\r\nthough a genuine lover of literature, could not pay the additional\r\nsixpence--or rather he was willing to pay it but hoped to get it back\r\nagain at the end.\r\n\r\nSo fantasy asks us to pay something extra.\r\n\r\nLet us now distinguish between fantasy and prophecy.\r\n\r\nThey are alike in having gods, and unlike in the gods they have. There\r\nis in both the sense of mythology which differentiates them from other\r\naspects of our subject. An invocation is again possible, therefore on\r\nbehalf of fantasy let us now invoke all beings who inhabit the lower\r\nair, the shallow water, and the smaller hills, all Fauns and Dryads and\r\nslips of the memory, all verbal coincidences, Pans and puns, all that is\r\nmediæval this side of the grave. When we come to prophecy, we shall\r\nutter no invocation, but it will have been to whatever transcends our\r\nabilities, even when it is human passion that transcends them, to the\r\ndeities of India, Greece, Scandinavia and Judæa, to all that is\r\nmediæval beyond the grave and to Lucifer son of the morning. By their\r\nmythologies we shall distinguish these two sorts of novels.\r\n\r\nA number of rather small gods then should haunt us today--I would call\r\nthem fairies if the word were not consecrated to imbecility. (Do you\r\nbelieve in fairies? No, not under any circumstances.) The stuff of daily\r\nlife will be tugged and strained in various directions, the earth will\r\nbe given little tilts mischievous or pensive, spot lights will fall on\r\nobjects that have no reason to anticipate or welcome them, and tragedy\r\nherself, though not excluded, will have a fortuitous air as if a word\r\nwould disarm her. The power of fantasy penetrates into every corner of\r\nthe universe, but not into the forces that govern it--the stars that are\r\nthe brain of heaven, the army of unalterable law, remain untouched--and\r\nnovels of this type have an improvised air, which is the secret of their\r\nforce and charm. They may contain solid character-drawing, penetrating\r\nand bitter criticism of conduct and civilization; yet our simile of the\r\nbeam of light must remain, and if one god must be invoked specially, let\r\nus call upon Hermes--messenger, thief, and conductor of souls to a not\r\ntoo terrible hereafter.\r\n\r\nYou will expect me now to say that a fantastic book asks us to accept\r\nthe supernatural. I will say it, but reluctantly, because any statement\r\nas to their subject matter brings these novels into the claws of\r\ncritical apparatus, from which it is important that they should be\r\nsaved. It is truer of them than of most books that we can only know what\r\nis in them by reading them, and their appeal is specially personal--they\r\nare sideshows inside the main show. So I would rather hedge as much as\r\npossible, and say that they ask us to accept either the supernatural or\r\nits absence.\r\n\r\nA reference to the greatest of the them--_Tristram Shandy_--will make\r\nthis point clear. The supernatural is absent from the Shandy ménage,\r\nyet a thousand incidents suggest that it is not far off. It would not be\r\nreally odd, would it, if the furniture in Mr. Shandy's bedroom, where he\r\nretired in despair after hearing the omitted details of his son's birth,\r\nshould come alive like Belinda's toilette in _The Rape of the Lock_, or\r\nthat Uncle Toby's drawbridge should lead into Lilliput? There is a\r\ncharmed stagnation about the whole epic--the more the characters do the\r\nless gets done, the less they have to say the more they talk, the harder\r\nthey think the softer they get, facts have an unholy tendency to unwind\r\nand trip up the past instead of begetting the future, as in\r\nwell-conducted books, and the obstinacy of inanimate objects, like Dr.\r\nSlop's bag, is most suspicious. Obviously a god is hidden in _Tristram\r\nShandy_, his name is Muddle, and some readers cannot accept him. Muddle\r\nis almost incarnate--quite to reveal his awful features was not Sterne's\r\nintention; that is the deity that lurks behind his masterpiece--the army\r\nof unutterable muddle, the universe as a hot chestnut. Small wonder that\r\nanother divine muddler, Dr. Johnson, writing in 1776, should remark,\r\n\"Nothing odd will do long: _Tristram Shandy_ did not last!\" Doctor\r\nJohnson was not always happy in his literary judgments, but the\r\nappropriateness of this one passes belief.\r\n\r\nWell, that must serve as our definition of fantasy. It implies the\r\nsupernatural, but need not express it. Often it does express it, and\r\nwere that type of classification helpful, we could make a list of the\r\ndevices which writers of a fantastic turn have used--such as the\r\nintroduction of a god, ghost, angel, monkey, monster, midget, witch into\r\nordinary life; or the introduction of ordinary men into no man's land,\r\nthe future, the past, the interior of the earth, the fourth dimension;\r\nor divings into and dividings of personality; or finally the device of\r\nparody or adaptation. These devices need never grow stale; they will\r\noccur naturally to writers of a certain temperament, and be put to fresh\r\nuse; but the fact that their number is strictly limited is of interest;\r\nand suggests that the beam of light can only be manipulated in certain\r\nways.\r\n\r\nI will select, as a typical example, a recent book about a witch:\r\n_Flecker's Magic_, by Norman Matson. It seemed to me good and I\r\nrecommended it to a friend whose judgment I respect. He thought it poor.\r\nThat is what is so tiresome about new books; they never give us that\r\nrestful feeling which we have when perusing the classics. _Flecker's\r\nMagic_ contains scarcely anything that is new--fantasies cannot: only\r\nthe old old story of the wishing ring which brings either misery or\r\nnothing at all. Flecker, an American boy who is learning to paint in\r\nParis, is given the ring by a girl in a café; she is a witch, she tells\r\nhim; he has only to be sure what he wants and he will get it. To prove\r\nher power, a motor-bus rises slowly from the street and turns upside\r\ndown in the air. The passengers, who do not fall out, try to look as if\r\nnothing was happening. The driver, who is standing on the pavement at\r\nthe moment, cannot conceal his surprise, but when his bus returns safe\r\nto earth again he thinks it wiser to get into his seat and drive off as\r\nusual. Motor-buses do not revolve slowly through the air--so they do\r\nnot. Flecker now accepts the ring. His character, though slightly\r\nsketched, is individual, and this definiteness causes the book to grip.\r\n\r\nIt proceeds with a growing tension, a series of little shocks. The\r\nmethod is Socratic. The boy starts by thinking of something obvious,\r\nlike a Rolls-Royce. But where shall he put the beastly thing? Or a\r\nbeautiful lady. But what about her carte d'identité? Or money? Ah,\r\nthat's more like it--he is almost a beggar. Say a million dollars. He\r\nprepares to turn the ring for this wish--except while one's about it two\r\nmillions seem safer--or ten--or--and money blares out into madness, and\r\nthe same thing happens when he thinks of long life: to die in forty\r\nyears--no, in fifty--in one hundred--horrible, horrible. Then a solution\r\noccurs. He has always wanted to be a great painter. Well, he'll be it at\r\nonce. But what kind of greatness? Giotto's? Cézanne's? Certainly not;\r\nhis own kind, and he does not know what that is, so this wish likewise\r\nis impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd now a horrible old woman begins to haunt his days and dreams. She\r\nreminds him vaguely of the girl who gave him the ring. She knows his\r\nthoughts and she is always sidling up to him in the streets and saying,\r\n\"Dear boy--darling boy--wish for happiness.\" We learn in time that she\r\nis the real witch--the girl was a human acquaintance whom she used to\r\nget into touch with Flecker. The last of the witches--very lonely. The\r\nrest have committed suicide during the eighteenth century--they could\r\nnot endure to survive into the world of Newton where two and two make\r\nfour, and even the world of Einstein is not sufficiently decentralised\r\nto revive them. She has hung on in the hope of smashing this world, and\r\nshe wants the boy to ask for happiness because such a wish has never\r\nbeen made in all the history of the ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps Flecker was the first modern man to find himself in this\r\npredicament? The people of the old world had so little they knew surely\r\nwhat they wanted. They knew about Almighty God, who wore a beard and sat\r\nin an armchair about a mile above the fields, and life was very short\r\nand very long too, for the days were so full of unthinking effort.\r\n\r\nThe people of the recorded olden times wished for a beautiful castle on\r\na high hill and lived therein until death. But the hill was not so high\r\none might see from the windows back along thirty centuries--as one may\r\nfrom a bungalow. In the castle there were no great volumes filled with\r\nwords and pictures of things dug up by man's relentless curiosity from\r\nsand and soil in all comers of the world; there was a sentimental\r\nhalf-belief in dragons, but no knowledge that once upon a time only\r\ndragons had lived on the earth--that man's grandfather and grandmother\r\nwere dragons; there were no movies flickering like thoughts against a\r\nwhite wall, no phonograph, no machinery with which to achieve the\r\nsensation of speed; no diagrams of the fourth dimension, no contrasts in\r\nlife like that of Waterville, Minn., and Paris, France. In the castle\r\nthe light was weak and flickering, hallways were dark, rooms deeply\r\nshadowed. The little outside world was full of shadow, and on the very\r\ntop of the mind of him who lived in the castle played a dim\r\nlight--underneath were shadows, fear, ignorance, will-to-ignorance. Most\r\nof all, there was not in the castle on the hill the breathless sense of\r\nimminent revelation--that today or surely tomorrow Man would at a stroke\r\ndouble his power and change the world again.\r\n\r\nThe ancient tales of magic were the mumbling thoughts of a distant\r\nshabby little world--so, at least, thought Flecker, offended. The tales\r\ngave him no guidance. There was too much difference between his world\r\nand theirs.\r\n\r\nHe wondered if he hadn't dismissed the wish for happiness rather\r\nheedlessly? He seemed to get nowhere thinking about it. He was not wise\r\nenough. In the old tales a wish for happiness was never made! He\r\nwondered why.\r\n\r\nHe might chance it--just to see what would happen. The thought made him\r\ntremble. He leaped from his bed and paced the red-tiled floor, rubbing\r\nhis hands together.\r\n\r\n\"I want to be happy for ever,\" he whispered, to hear the words, careful\r\nnot to touch the ring. \"_Happy ... for ever_\"--the two syllables of the\r\nfirst word, like hard little pebbles, struck musically against the bell\r\nof his imagination, but the second was a sigh. _For ever_--his spirit\r\nsank under the soft heavy impact of it. Held in his thought the word\r\nmade a dreary music, fading. \"_Happy for ever_\"--NO!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThus again and again--the mark of the true fantasist--does Norman Matson\r\nmerge the kingdoms of magic and common sense by using words that apply\r\nto both, and the mixture he has created comes alive. I will not tell the\r\nend of the story. You will have guessed its essentials, but there are\r\nalways surprises in the working of a fresh mind, and to the end of time\r\ngood literature will be made round this notion of a wish.\r\n\r\nTo turn from this simple example of the supernatural to a more\r\ncomplicated one--to a highly accomplished and superbly written book\r\nwhose spirit is farcical: _Zuleika Dobson_ by Max Beerbohm. You all know\r\nMiss Dobson--not personally, or you would not be here now. She is that\r\ndamsel for love of whom all the undergraduates of Oxford except one\r\ndrowned themselves during Eights week, and he threw himself out of a\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nA superb theme for a fantasy, but all will depend on the handling. It is\r\ntreated with a mixture of realism, wittiness, charm and mythology, and\r\nthe mythology is most important. Max has borrowed or created a number of\r\nsupernatural machines--to have entrusted Zuleika to one of them would be\r\ninept; the fantasy would become heavy or thin. But we pass from the\r\nsweating emperors to the black and pink pearls, the hooting owls, the\r\ninterference of the Muse Clio, the ghosts of Chopin and George Sand, of\r\nNellie O'Mora; just as one fails another starts, to uphold this gayest\r\nand most exquisite of funeral palls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the square, across the High, down Grove Street they\r\npassed. The Duke looked up at the tower of Merton, _ώs oὔπoτ' αὗθιs\r\nἀλλὰ νῦν πανύστατoν_. Strange that tonight it would still be\r\nstanding here, in all its sober and solid beauty--still be\r\ngazing, over the roofs and chimneys, at the tower of Magdalen, its\r\nrightful bride. Through untold centuries of the future it would stand\r\nthus, gaze thus. He winced. Oxford walls have a way of belittling us;\r\nand the Duke was loth to regard his doom as trivial.\r\n\r\nAye, by all minerals we are mocked. Vegetables, yearly deciduous, are\r\nfar more sympathetic. The lilac and laburnum, making lovely now the\r\nrailed pathway to Christ Church meadow, were all a-swaying and nodding\r\nto the Duke as he passed by. \"Adieu, adieu, your Grace,\" they were\r\nwhispering. \"We are very sorry for you, very sorry indeed. We never\r\ndared suppose you would predecease us. We think your death a very great\r\ntragedy. Adieu! Perhaps we shall meet in another world--that is, if the\r\nmembers of the animal kingdom have immortal souls, as we have.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke was little versed in their language; yet, as he passed between\r\nthese gently garrulous blooms, he caught at the least the drift of their\r\nsalutation, and smiled a vague but courteous acknowledgment, to the\r\nright and the left alternately, creating a very favourable impression.\r\n\r\n\r\nHas not a passage like this--with its freedom of invocation--a beauty\r\nunattainable by serious literature? It is so funny and charming, so\r\niridescent yet so profound. Criticisms of human nature fly through the\r\nbook, not like arrows but upon the wings of sylphs. Towards the\r\nend--that dreadful end often so fatal to fiction--the book rather flags:\r\nthe suicide of all the undergraduates of Oxford is not as delightful as\r\nit ought to be when viewed at close quarters, and the defenestration of\r\nNoaks almost nasty. Still it is a great work--the most consistent\r\nachievement of fantasy in our time, and the closing scene in Zuleika's\r\nbedroom with its menace of further disasters is impeccable.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now with pent breath and fast-beating heart, she stared at the lady\r\nof the mirror, without seeing her; and now she wheeled round and swiftly\r\nglided to that little table on which stood her two books. She snatched\r\nBradshaw.\r\n\r\nWe always intervene between Bradshaw and any one whom we see consulting\r\nhim. \"Mademoiselle will permit me to find that which she seeks?\" asked\r\nMelisande.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet,\" said Zuleika. We always repulse, at first, any one who\r\nintervenes between us and Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nWe always end by accepting the intervention. \"See if it is possible to\r\ngo direct from here to Cambridge,\" said Zuleika, handing the book on.\r\n\"If it isn't, then--well, see how one _does_ get there.\"\r\n\r\nWe never have any confidence in the intervener. Nor is the intervener,\r\nwhen it comes to the point, sanguine. With mistrust mounting to\r\nexasperation Zuleika sat watching the faint and frantic researches of\r\nher maid.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" she said suddenly. \"I have a much better idea. Go down very\r\nearly to the station. See the stationmaster. Order me a special train.\r\nFor ten o'clock, say.\"\r\n\r\nRising, she stretched her arms above her head. Her lips parted in a\r\nyawn, met in a smile. With both hands she pushed back her hair from her\r\nshoulders, and twisted it into a loose knot. Very lightly she slipped up\r\ninto bed, and very soon she was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Zuleika ought to have come on to this place. She does not seem ever\r\nto have arrived and we can only suppose that through the intervention of\r\nthe gods her special train failed to start, or, more likely, is still in\r\na siding at Bletchley.\r\n\r\nAmong the devices in my list I mentioned \"parody\" or \"adaptation\" and\r\nwould now examine this further. The fantasist here adopts for his\r\nmythology some earlier work and uses it as a framework or quarry for his\r\nown purposes. There is an aborted example of this in _Joseph Andrews_.\r\nFielding set out to use _Pamela_ as a comic mythology. He thought it\r\nwould be fun to invent a brother to Pamela, a pure-minded footman, who\r\nshould repulse Lady Booby's attentions just as Pamela had repulsed Mr.\r\nB.'s, and he made Lady Booby Mr. B.'s aunt. Thus he would be able to\r\nlaugh at Richardson, and incidentally express his own views of life.\r\nFielding's view of life however was of the sort that only rests content\r\nwith the creation of solid round characters, and with the growth of\r\nParson Adams and Mrs. Slipslop the fantasy ceases, and we get an\r\nindependent work. _Joseph Andrews_ (which is also important\r\nhistorically) is interesting to us as an example of a false start. Its\r\nauthor begins by playing the fool in a Richardsonian world, and ends by\r\nbeing serious in a world of his own--the world of Tom Jones and Amelia.\r\n\r\nParody or adaptation have enormous advantages to certain novelists,\r\nparticularly to those who may have a great deal to say and plenty of\r\nliterary genius, but who do not see the world in terms of individual men\r\nand women--who do not, in other words, take easily to creating\r\ncharacters. How are such men to start writing? An already existing book\r\nor literary tradition may inspire them--they may find high up in its\r\ncornices a pattern that will serve as a beginning, they may swing about\r\nin its rafters and gain strength. That fantasy of Lowes Dickinson, _The\r\nMagic Flute_, seems to be created thus: it has taken as its mythology\r\nthe world of Mozart. Tamino, Sarastro, and the Queen of the Night stand\r\nin their enchanted kingdom ready for the author's thoughts, and when\r\nthese are poured in they become alive and a new and exquisite work is\r\nborn. And the same is true of another fantasy, anything but\r\nexquisite--James Joyce's _Ulysses_[6] That remarkable affair--perhaps\r\nthe most interesting literary experiment of our day--could not have been\r\nachieved unless Joyce had had, as his guide and butt, the world of the\r\n_Odyssey_.\r\n\r\nI am only touching on one aspect of _Ulysses_: it is of course more than\r\na fantasy--it is a dogged attempt to cover the universe with mud, it is\r\nan inverted Victorianism, an attempt to make crossness and dirt succeed\r\nwhere sweetness and light failed, a simplification of the human\r\ncharacter in the interests of Hell. All simplifications are fascinating,\r\nall lead us away from the truth (which lies far nearer the muddle of\r\n_Tristram Shandy_), and _Ulysses_ must not detain us on the ground that\r\nit contains a morality--otherwise we shall also have to discuss Mrs.\r\nHumphry Ward. We are concerned with it because, through a mythology,\r\nJoyce has been able to create the peculiar stage and characters he\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe action of those 400,000 words occupies a single day, the scene is\r\nDublin, the theme is a journey--the modern man's journey from morn to\r\nmidnight, from bed to the squalid tasks of mediocrity, to a funeral,\r\nnewspaper office, library, pub, lavatory, lying-in hospital, a saunter\r\nby the beach, brothel, coffee stall, and so back to bed. And it coheres\r\nbecause it depends from the journey of a hero through the seas of\r\nGreece, like a bat hanging to a cornice.\r\n\r\nUlysses himself is Mr. Leopold Bloom--a converted Jew--greedy,\r\nlascivious, timid, undignified, desultory, superficial, kindly and\r\nalways at his lowest when he pretends to aspire. He tries to explore\r\nlife through the body. Penelope is Mrs. Marion Bloom, an overblown\r\nsoprano, by no means harsh to her suitors. The third character is young\r\nStephen Dedalus, whom Bloom recognizes as his spiritual son much as\r\nUlysses recognizes Telemachus as his actual son. Stephen tries to\r\nexplore life through the intellect--we have met him before in _The\r\nPortrait of the Artist as a Young Man_, and now he is worked into this\r\nepic of grubbiness and disillusion. He and Bloom meet half way through\r\nin Night Town (which corresponds partly to Homer's Palace of Circe,\r\npartly to his Descent into Hell) and in its supernatural and filthy\r\nalleys they strike up their slight but genuine friendship. This is the\r\ncrisis of the book, and here--and indeed throughout--smaller mythologies\r\nswarm and pullulate, like vermin between the scales of a poisonous\r\nsnake. Heaven and earth fill with infernal life, personalities melt,\r\nsexes interchange, until the whole universe, including poor,\r\npleasure-loving Mr. Bloom, is involved in one joyless orgy.\r\n\r\nDoes it come off? No, not quite. Indignation in literature never quite\r\ncomes off either in Juvenal or Swift or Joyce; there is something in\r\nwords that is alien to its simplicity. The Night Town scene does not\r\ncome off except as a superfetation of fantasies, a monstrous coupling of\r\nreminiscences. Such satisfaction as can be attained in this direction is\r\nattained, and all through the bode we have similar experiments--the aim\r\nof which is to degrade all things and more particularly civilization and\r\nart, by turning them inside out and upside down. Some enthusiasts may\r\nthink that _Ulysses_ ought to be mentioned not here but later on, under\r\nthe heading of prophecy, and I understand this criticism. But I prefer\r\nto mention it today with _Tristram Shandy_, _Flecker's Magic_, _Zuleika\r\nDobson_, and _The Magic Flute_, because the raging of Joyce, like the\r\nhappier or calmer moods of the other writers, seems essentially\r\nfantastic, and lacks the note for which we shall be listening soon.\r\n\r\nWe must pursue this notion of mythology further, and more circumspectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Ulysses_ (Shakespeare & Co., Paris) is not at present\r\nobtainable in England. America, more enlightened, has produced a\r\nmutilated version without the author's permission and without\r\npaying him a cent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nPROPHECY\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH prophecy in the narrow sense of foretelling the future we have no\r\nconcern, and we have not much concern with it as an appeal for\r\nrighteousness. What will interest us today--what we must respond to, for\r\ninterest now becomes an inappropriate word--is an accent in the\r\nnovelist's voice, an accent for which the flutes and saxophones of\r\nfantasy may have prepared us. His theme is the universe, or something\r\nuniversal, but he is not necessarily going to \"say\" anything about the\r\nuniverse; he proposes to sing, and the strangeness of song arising in\r\nthe halls of fiction is bound to give us a shock. How will song combine\r\nwith the furniture of common sense? we shall ask ourselves, and shall\r\nhave to answer \"not too well\": the singer does not always have room for\r\nhis gestures, the tables and chairs get broken, and the novel through\r\nwhich bardic influence has passed often has a wrecked air, like a\r\ndrawing-room after an earthquake or a children's party. Readers of D. H.\r\nLawrence will understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nProphecy--in our sense--is a tone of voice. It may imply any of the\r\nfaiths that have haunted humanity--Christianity, Buddhism, dualism,\r\nSatanism, or the mere raising of human love and hatred to such a power\r\nthat their normal receptacles no longer contain them: but what\r\nparticular view of the universe is recommended--with that we are not\r\ndirectly concerned. It is the implication that signifies and will filter\r\ninto the turns of the novelist's phrase, and in this lecture, which\r\npromises to be so vague and grandiose, we may come nearer than elsewhere\r\nto the minutiae of style. We shall have to attend to the novelist's\r\nstate of mind and to the actual words he uses; we shall neglect as far\r\nas we can the problems of common sense. As far as we can: for all novels\r\ncontain tables and chairs, and most readers of fiction look for them\r\nfirst. Before we condemn him for affectation and distortion we must\r\nrealize his view point. He is not looking at the tables and chairs at\r\nall, and that is why they are out of focus. We only see what he does not\r\nfocus--not what he does--and in our blindness we laugh at him.\r\n\r\nI have said that each aspect of the novel demands a different quality in\r\nthe reader. Well, the prophetic aspect demands two qualities: humility\r\nand the suspension of the sense of humour. Humility is a quality for\r\nwhich I have only a limited admiration. In many phases of life it is a\r\ngreat mistake and degenerates into defensiveness or hypocrisy. But\r\nhumility is in place just now. Without its help we shall not hear the\r\nvoice of the prophet, and our eyes will behold a figure of fun instead\r\nof his glory. And the sense of humour--that is out of place: that\r\nestimable adjunct of the educated man must be laid aside. Like the\r\nschoolchildren in the Bible, one cannot help laughing at a prophet--his\r\nbald head is so absurd--but one can discount the laughter and realize\r\nthat it has no critical value and is merely food for bears.\r\n\r\nLet us distinguish between the prophet and the non-prophet.\r\n\r\nThere were two novelists, who were both brought up in Christianity. They\r\nspeculated and broke away, yet they neither left nor did they want to\r\nleave the Christian spirit which they interpreted as a loving spirit.\r\nThey both held that sin is always punished, and punishment a purgation,\r\nand they saw this process not with the detachment of an ancient Greek or\r\na modern Hindu, but with tears in their eyes. Pity, they felt, is the\r\natmosphere in which morality exercises its logic, a logic which\r\notherwise is crude and meaningless. What is the use of a sinner being\r\npunished and cured if there is not an addition in the cure, a heavenly\r\nbonus? And where does the addition come from? Not out of the machinery,\r\nbut out of the atmosphere in which the process occurs, out of the love\r\nand pity which (they believed) are attributes of God.\r\n\r\nHow similar these two novelists must have been! Yet one of them was\r\nGeorge Eliot and the other Dostoevsky.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that Dostoevsky had vision. Still, so had George Eliot.\r\nTo classify them apart--and they must be parted--is not so easy. But the\r\ndifference between them will define itself at once exactly if I read two\r\npassages from their works. To the classifier the passages will seem\r\nsimilar: to any one who has an ear for song they come out of different\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nI will begin with a passage--fifty years ago it was a very famous\r\npassage--out of _Adam Bede_. Hetty is in prison, condemned to die for\r\nthe murder of her illegitimate child. She will not confess, she is hard\r\nand impenitent. Dinah, the Methodist, comes to visit her and tries to\r\ntouch her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat\r\nbeside her. But she felt the Divine presence more and more--nay, as if\r\nshe herself were a part of it, and it was the Divine pity that was\r\nbeating in her heart, and was willing the rescue of this helpless one.\r\nAt last she was prompted to speak, and find out how far Hetty was\r\nconscious of the present.\r\n\r\n\"Hetty,\" she said gently, \"do you know who it is that sits by your\r\nside?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Hetty answered slowly, \"it's Dinah.\" Then, after a pause, she\r\nadded, \"But you can do nothing for me. You can't make 'em do anything.\r\nThey'll hang me o' Monday--it's Friday now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Hetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one\r\nclose to you.\"\r\n\r\nHetty said, in a frightened whisper, \"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and\r\ntrouble--who has known every thought you have had--has seen where you\r\nwent, where you lay down and rose up again, and all the deeds you have\r\ntried to hide in darkness. And on Monday, when I can't follow you, when\r\nmy arms can't reach you, when death has parted us, He who is\r\nwith you now and knows all, will be with you then. It makes no\r\ndifference--whether we live or die we are in the presence of God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Dinah, won't nobody do anything for me? _Will_ they hang me for\r\ncertain? ... I wouldn't mind if they'd let me live ... help me.... I\r\ncan't feel anything like you ... my heart is hard.\"\r\n\r\nDinah held the clinging hand, and all her soul went forth in her voice:\r\n\"... Come, mighty Saviour! let the dead hear Thy voice; let the eyes of\r\nthe blind be opened: let her see that God encompasses her; let her\r\ntremble at nothing but the sin that cuts her off from Him. Melt the hard\r\nheart; unseal the closed lips: make her cry with her whole soul,\r\n'Father, I have sinned.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinah,\" Hetty sobbed out, throwing her arms round Dinah's neck, \"I will\r\nspeak ... I will tell ... I won't hide it any more. I did do it,\r\nDinah ... I buried in the wood ... the little baby ... and it cried ... I\r\nheard it cry ... ever such a way off ... all night ... and I went back\r\nbecause it cried.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused and then spoke hurriedly in a louder pleading tone.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought perhaps it wouldn't die--there might somebody find it. I\r\ndidn't kill it--I didn't kill it myself. I put it down there and covered\r\nit up, and when I came back it was gone.... I don't know what I felt\r\nuntil I found that the baby was gone. And when I put it there, I thought\r\nI should like somebody to find it and save it from dying, but when I saw\r\nit was gone, I was struck like a stone, with fear. I never thought o'\r\nstirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn't run away, and everybody as\r\nsaw me 'ud know about the baby. My heart went like stone; I couldn't\r\nwish or try for anything; it seemed like as if I should stay there for\r\never, and nothing 'ud ever change. But they came and took me away.\"\r\n\r\nHetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still\r\nsomething behind: and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that tears\r\nmust come before words. At last Hetty burst out with a sob.\r\n\r\n\"Dinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place in the\r\nwood, now I've told everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us pray, poor sinner: let us fall on our knees again, and pray to\r\nthe God of all mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have not done justice to this scene, because I have had to cut it, and\r\nit is on her massiveness that George Eliot depends--she has no nicety of\r\nstyle. The scene is sincere, solid, pathetic, and penetrated with\r\nChristianity. The god whom Dinah summons is a living force to the\r\nauthoress also: he is not brought in to work up the reader's feelings;\r\nhe is the natural accompaniment of human error and suffering.\r\n\r\nNow contrast with it the following scene from _The Brothers Karamazov_\r\n(Mitya is being accused of the murder of his father, of which he is\r\nindeed spiritually though not technically guilty).\r\n\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. Mitya got up, moved\r\nfrom his chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large chest\r\ncovered by a rug, and instantly fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHe was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he had been stationed\r\nlong ago, and a peasant was driving him in a cart with a pair of horses,\r\nthrough snow and sleet. Not far off was a village; he could see the\r\nblack huts, and half the huts were burned down, there were only the\r\ncharred beams sticking up. And as they drove in, there were peasant\r\nwomen drawn up along the road, a lot of women, a whole row, all thin and\r\nwan, with their faces a sort of brownish colour, especially one at the\r\nedge, a tall bony woman, who looked forty, but might have been only\r\ntwenty, with a long thin face. And in her arms was a little baby crying.\r\nAnd her breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in\r\nthem. And the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare arms,\r\nwith its little fists blue from cold.\r\n\r\n\"Why are they crying? Why are they crying?\" Mitya asked as they dashed\r\ngaily by.\r\n\r\n\"It's the babe,\" answered the driver. \"The babe weeping.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mitya was struck by his saying, in his peasant way, \"the babe,\" and\r\nhe liked the peasant calling it \"the babe.\" There seemed more pity in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"But why is it weeping?\" Mitya persisted stupidly. \"Why are its little\r\narms bare? Why don't they wrap it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're begging\r\nbecause they've been burnt out.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. \"Tell me, why is\r\nit those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor? Why is the babe\r\npoor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don't they hug each other and kiss?\r\nWhy don't they sing songs of joy? Why are they so dark from black\r\nmisery? Why don't they feed the babe?\"\r\n\r\nAnd he felt that, though his questions were unreasonable and senseless,\r\nyet he wanted to ask just that, and he had to ask it just in that way.\r\nAnd he felt that a passion of pity, such as he had never known before,\r\nwas rising in his heart, that he wanted to cry, that he wanted to do\r\nsomething for them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that\r\nthe dark-faced dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed\r\ntears again from that moment, and he wanted to do it at once, at once,\r\nregardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the\r\nKaramazovs.... And his heart glowed, and he struggled forward towards\r\nthe light, and he longed to live, to go on and on, towards the new\r\nbeckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!\r\n\r\n\"What! Where?\" he exclaimed, opening his eyes, and sitting up on the\r\nchest, as though he had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly. Nikolay\r\nParfenovitch was standing over him, suggesting that he should hear the\r\nprotocol read aloud and sign it. Mitya guessed that he had been asleep\r\nan hour or more, but he did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. He was\r\nsuddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his head,\r\nwhich hadn't been there when he leant back exhausted, on the chest.\r\n\r\n\"Who put that pillow under my head? Who was so kind?\" he cried, with a\r\nsort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his voice, as though some great\r\nkindness had been shown him.\r\n\r\nHe never found out who this kind man was, perhaps one of the peasant\r\nwitnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary had\r\ncompassionately thought to put a pillow under his head, but his whole\r\nsoul was quivering with tears. He went to the table and said he would\r\nsign whatever they liked.\r\n\r\n\"I've had a good dream, gentlemen,\" he said in a strange voice, with a\r\nnew light, as of joy, in his face.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow what is the difference in these passages--a difference that throbs\r\nin every phrase? It is that the first writer is a preacher, and the\r\nsecond a prophet. George Eliot talks about God, but never alters her\r\nfocus; God and the tables and chairs are all in the same plane, and in\r\nconsequence we have not for a moment the feeling that the whole universe\r\nneeds pity and love--they are only needed in Hetty's cell. In Dostoevsky\r\nthe characters and situations always stand for more than themselves;\r\ninfinity attends them; though yet they remain individuals they expand to\r\nembrace it and summon it to embrace them; one can apply to them the\r\nsaying of St. Catherine of Siena that God is in the soul and the soul is\r\nin God as the sea is in the fish and the fish is in the sea. Every\r\nsentence he writes implies this extension, and the implication is the\r\ndominant aspect of his work. He is a great novelist in the ordinary\r\nsense--that is to say his characters have relation to ordinary life and\r\nalso live in their own surroundings, there are incidents which keep us\r\nexcited, and so on; he has also the greatness of a prophet, to which our\r\nordinary standards are inapplicable.\r\n\r\nThat is the gulf between Hetty and Mitya, though they inhabit the same\r\nmoral and mythological worlds. Hetty, taken by herself, is quite\r\nadequate. She is a poor girl, brought to confess her crime, and so to a\r\nbetter frame of mind. But Mitya, taken by himself, is not adequate. He\r\nonly becomes real through what he implies, his mind is not in a frame at\r\nall. Taken by himself he seems distorted out of drawing, intermittent;\r\nwe begin explaining him away and saying he was disproportionately\r\ngrateful for the pillow because he was overwrought--very like a Russian\r\nin fact. We cannot understand him until we see that he extends, and that\r\nthe part of him on which Dostoevsky focused did not lie on that wooden\r\nchest or even in dreamland but in a region where it could be joined by\r\nthe rest of humanity. Mitya is--all of us. So is Alyosha, so is\r\nSmerdyakov. He is the prophetic vision, and the novelist's creation\r\nalso. He does not become all of us here: he is Mitya here as Hetty is\r\nHetty. The extension, the melting, the unity through love and pity occur\r\nin a region which can only be implied and to which fiction is perhaps\r\nthe wrong approach. The world of the Karamazovs and Myshkin and\r\nRaskolnikov, the world of Moby Dick which we shall enter shortly, it is\r\nnot a veil, it is not an allegory. It is the ordinary world of fiction,\r\nbut it reaches back. And that tiny humorous figure of Lady Bertram whom\r\nwe considered some time ago--Lady Bertram sitting on her sofa with\r\npug--may assist us in these deeper matters. Lady Bertram, we decided,\r\nwas a flat character, capable of extending into a round when the action\r\nrequired it. Mitya is a round character, but he is capable of extension.\r\nHe does not conceal anything (mysticism), he does not mean anything\r\n(symbolism), he is merely Dmitri Karamazov, but to be merely a person in\r\nDostoevsky is to join up with all the other people far back.\r\nConsequently the tremendous current suddenly flows--for me in those\r\nclosing words: \"I've had a good dream, gentlemen.\" Have I had that good\r\ndream too? No, Dostoevsky's characters ask us to share something deeper\r\nthan their experiences. They convey to us a sensation that is partly\r\nphysical--the sensation of sinking into a translucent globe and seeing\r\nour experience floating far above us on its surface, tiny, remote, yet\r\nours. We have not ceased to be people, we have given nothing up, but\r\n\"the sea is in the fish and the fish is in the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThere we touch the limit of our subject. We are not concerned with the\r\nprophet's message, or rather (since matter and manner cannot be wholly\r\nseparated) we are concerned with it as little as possible. What matters\r\nis the accent of his voice, his song. Hetty might have a good dream in\r\nprison, and it would be true of her, satisfyingly true, but it would\r\nstop short. Dinah would say she was glad, Hetty would recount her dream,\r\nwhich, unlike Mitya's, would be logically connected with the crisis, and\r\nGeorge Eliot would say something sound and sympathetic about good dreams\r\ngenerally, and their inexplicably helpful effect on the tortured breast.\r\nJust the same and absolutely different are the two scenes, the two\r\nbooks, the two writers.\r\n\r\nNow another point appears. Regarded merely as a novelist the prophet has\r\ncertain uncanny advantages, so that it is sometimes worth letting him\r\ninto a drawing-room even on the furniture's account. Perhaps he will\r\nsmash or distort, but perhaps he will illumine. As I said of the\r\nfantasist, he manipulates a beam of light which occasionally touches the\r\nobjects so sedulously dusted by the hand of common sense, and renders\r\nthem more vivid than they can ever be in domesticity. This intermittent\r\nrealism pervades all the greater works of Dostoevsky and Herman\r\nMelville. Dostoevsky can be patiently accurate about a trial or the\r\nappearance of a staircase. Melville can catalogue the products of the\r\nwhale (\"I have ever found the plain things the knottiest of all,\" he\r\nremarks). D. H. Lawrence can describe a field of grass and flowers or\r\nthe entrance into Fremantle. Little things in the foreground seem to be\r\nall that the prophet cares about at moments--he sits down with them so\r\nquiet and busy like a child between two romps. What does he feel during\r\nthese intermittencies? Is it another form of excitement, or is he\r\nresting? We cannot know. No doubt it is what A.E. feels when he is doing\r\nhis creameries, or what Claudel feels when he is doing his diplomacy,\r\nbut what is that? Anyhow, it characterizes these novels and gives them\r\nwhat is always provocative in a work of art: roughness of surface. While\r\nthey pass under our eyes they are full of dents and grooves and lumps\r\nand spikes which draw from us little cries of approval and disapproval.\r\nWhen they have past, the roughness is forgotten, they become as smooth\r\nas the moon.\r\n\r\nProphetic fiction, then, seems to have definite characteristics. It\r\ndemands humility and the absence of the sense of humour. It reaches\r\nback--though we must not conclude from the example of Dostoevsky that it\r\nalways reaches back to pity and love. It is spasmodically realistic. And\r\nit gives us the sensation of a song or of sound. It is unlike fantasy\r\nbecause its face is towards unity, whereas fantasy glances about. Its\r\nconfusion is incidental, whereas fantasy's is fundamental--_Tristram\r\nShandy_ ought to be a muddle, _Zuleika Dobson_ ought to keep changing\r\nmythologies. Also the prophet--one imagines--has gone \"off\" more\r\ncompletely than the fantasist, he is in a remoter emotional state while\r\nhe composes. Not many novelists have this aspect. Poe is too incidental.\r\nHawthorne potters too anxiously round the problem of individual\r\nsalvation to get free. Hardy, a philosopher and a great poet, might seem\r\nto have claims, but Hardy's novels are surveys, they do not give out\r\nsounds. The writer sits back, it is true, but the characters do not\r\nreach back. He shows them to us as they let their arms rise and fall in\r\nthe air; they may parallel our sufferings but can never extend\r\nthem--never, I mean, could Jude step forward like Mitya and release\r\nfloods of our emotion by saying \"Gentlemen, I've had a bad dream.\"\r\nConrad is in a rather similar position. The voice, the voice of Marlow,\r\nis too full of experiences to sing, it is dulled by many reminiscences\r\nof error and beauty, its owner has seen too much to see beyond cause and\r\neffect. To have a philosophy--even a poetic and emotional philosophy\r\nlike Hardy's and Conrad's--leads to reflections on life and things. A\r\nprophet does not reflect. And he does not hammer away. That is why we\r\nexclude Joyce. Joyce has many qualities akin to prophecy and he has\r\nshown (especially in the _Portrait of the Artist_) an imaginative grasp\r\nof evil. But he undermines the universe in too workmanlike a manner,\r\nlooking round for this tool or that: in spite of all his internal\r\nlooseness he is too tight, he is never vague except after due\r\ndeliberation; it is talk, talk, never song.\r\n\r\nSo, though I believe this lecture is on a genuine aspect of the novel,\r\nnot a fake aspect, I can only think of four writers to illustrate\r\nit--Dostoevsky, Melville, D. H. Lawrence and Emily Brontë. Emily\r\nBrontë shall be left to the last, Dostoevsky I have alluded to,\r\nMelville is the centre of our picture, and the centre of Melville is\r\n_Moby Dick_.\r\n\r\n_Moby Dick_ is an easy book, as long as we read it as a yarn or an\r\naccount of whaling interspersed with snatches of poetry. But as soon as\r\nwe catch the song in it, it grows difficult and immensely important.\r\nNarrowed and hardened into words the spiritual theme of _Moby Dick_ is\r\nas follows: a battle against evil conducted too long or in the wrong\r\nway. The White Whale is evil, and Captain Ahab is warped by constant\r\npursuit until his knight-errantry turns into revenge. These are words--a\r\nsymbol for the book if we want one--but they do not carry us much\r\nfurther than the acceptance of the book as a yarn--perhaps they carry us\r\nbackwards, for they may mislead us into harmonizing the incidents, and\r\nso losing their roughness and richness. The idea of a contest we may\r\nretain: all action is a battle, the only happiness is peace. But contest\r\nbetween what? We get false if we say that it is between good and evil or\r\nbetween two unreconciled evils. The essential in _Moby Dick_, its\r\nprophetic song, flows athwart the action and the surface morality like\r\nan undercurrent. It lies outside words. Even at the end, when the ship\r\nhas gone down with the bird of heaven pinned to its mast, and the empty\r\ncoffin, bouncing up from the vortex, has carried Ishmael back to the\r\nworld--even then we cannot catch the words of the song. There has been\r\nstress, with intervals: but no explicable solution, certainly no\r\nreaching back into universal pity and love; no \"Gentlemen, I've had a\r\ngood dream.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary nature of the book appears in two of its early\r\nincidents--the sermon about Jonah and the friendship with Queequeg.\r\n\r\nThe sermon has nothing to do with Christianity. It asks for endurance or\r\nloyalty without hope of reward. The preacher \"kneeling in the pulpit's\r\nbows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed\r\neyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and\r\npraying at the bottom of the sea.\" Then he works up and up and concludes\r\non a note of joy that is far more terrifying than a menace.\r\n\r\n\r\nDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of\r\nthis base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him\r\nwho gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns and destroys all sin\r\nthough he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges.\r\nDelight--top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord,\r\nbut the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to\r\nhim, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob\r\ncan never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and\r\ndeliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his\r\nfinal breath--O Father!--chiefly known to me by thy rod--mortal or\r\nimmortal, here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this\r\nworld's or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee: for\r\nwhat is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe it is not a coincidence that the last ship we encounter at the\r\nend of the book before the final catastrophe should be called the\r\nDelight; a vessel of ill omen who has herself encountered Moby Dick and\r\nbeen shattered by him. But what the connection was in the prophet's mind\r\nI cannot say, nor could he tell us.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the sermon, Ishmael makes a passionate alliance with\r\nthe cannibal Queequeg, and it looks for a moment that the book is to be\r\na saga of blood-brotherhood. But human relationships mean little to\r\nMelville, and after a grotesque and violent entry, Queequeg is almost\r\nforgotten. Almost--not quite. Towards the end he falls ill and a coffin\r\nis made for him which he does not occupy, as he recovers. It is this\r\ncoffin, serving as a life-buoy, that saves Ishmael from the final\r\nwhirlpool, and this again is no coincidence, but an unformulated\r\nconnection that sprang up in Melville's mind. _Moby Dick_ is full of\r\nmeanings: its meaning is a different problem. It is wrong to turn the\r\nDelight or the coffin into symbols, because even if the symbolism is\r\ncorrect, it silences the book. Nothing can be stated about _Moby Dick_\r\nexcept that it is a contest. The rest is song.\r\n\r\nIt is to his conception of evil that Melville's work owes much of its\r\nstrength. As a rule evil has been feebly envisaged in fiction, which\r\nseldom soars above misconduct or avoids the clouds of mysteriousness.\r\nEvil to most novelists is either sexual and social or is something very\r\nvague for which a special style with implications of poetry is thought\r\nsuitable. They want it to exist, in order that it may kindly help them\r\non with the plot, and evil, not being kind, generally hampers them with\r\na villain--a Lovelace or Uriah Heep, who does more harm to the author\r\nthan to the fellow characters. For a real villain we must turn to a\r\nstory of Melville's called _Billy Budd_.[7]\r\n\r\nIt is a short story, but must be mentioned because of the light it\r\nthrows on his other work. The scene is on a British man-of-war soon\r\nafter the Mutiny at the Nore--a stagey yet intensely real vessel. The\r\nhero, a young sailor, has goodness--which is faint beside the goodness\r\nof Alyosha; still he has goodness of the glowing aggressive sort which\r\ncannot exist unless it has evil to consume. He is not aggressive\r\nhimself. It is the light within him that irritates and explodes. On the\r\nsurface he is a pleasant, merry, rather insensitive lad, whose perfect\r\nphysique is marred by one slight defect, a stammer, which finally\r\ndestroys him. He is \"dropped into a world not without some mantraps, and\r\nagainst whose subtleties simple courage without any touch of defensive\r\nugliness is of little avail; and where such innocence as man is capable\r\nof does yet, in a moral emergency, not always sharpen the faculties or\r\nenlighten the will.\" Claggart, one of the petty officers, at once sees\r\nin him the enemy--his own enemy, for Claggart is evil. It is again the\r\ncontest between Ahab and Moby Dick, though the parts are more clearly\r\nassigned, and we are further from prophecy and nearer to morality and\r\ncommon sense. But not much nearer. Claggart is not like any other\r\nvillain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural depravity has certain negative virtues, serving it as silent\r\nauxiliaries. It is not going too far to say that it is without vices or\r\nsmall sins. There is a phenomenal pride in it that excludes them from\r\nanything--never mercenary or avaricious. In short, the character here\r\nmeant partakes nothing of the sordid or sensual. It is serious, but free\r\nfrom acerbity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe accuses Billy of trying to foment a mutiny. The charge is ridiculous,\r\nno one believes it, and yet it proves fatal. For when the boy is\r\nsummoned to declare his innocence, he is so horrified that he cannot\r\nspeak, his ludicrous stammer seizes him, the power within him explodes,\r\nand he knocks down his traducer, kills him, and has to be hanged.\r\n\r\n_Billy Budd_ is a remote unearthly episode, but it is a song not without\r\nwords, and should be read both for its own beauty and as an introduction\r\nto more difficult works. Evil is labelled and personified instead of\r\nslipping over the ocean and round the world, and Melville's mind can be\r\nobserved more easily. What one notices in him is that his apprehensions\r\nare free from personal worry, so that we become bigger not smaller after\r\nsharing them. He has not got that tiresome little receptacle, a\r\nconscience, which is often such a nuisance in serious writers and so\r\ncontracts their effects--the conscience of Hawthorne or of Mark\r\nRutherford. Melville--after the initial roughness of his\r\nrealism--reaches straight back into the universal, to a blackness and\r\nsadness so transcending our own that they are undistinguishable from\r\nglory. He says, \"in certain moods no man can weigh this world without\r\nthrowing in a something somehow like Original Sin to strike the uneven\r\nbalance.\" He threw it in, that undefinable something, the balance\r\nrighted itself, and he gave us harmony and temporary salvation.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that D. H. Lawrence should have written two penetrating\r\nstudies of Melville, for Lawrence himself is, as far as I know, the only\r\nprophetic novelist writing today--all the rest are fantasists or\r\npreachers: the only living novelist in whom the song predominates, who\r\nhas the rapt bardic quality, and whom it is idle to criticize. He\r\ninvites criticism because he is a preacher also--it is this minor aspect\r\nof him which makes him so difficult and misleading--an excessively\r\nclever preacher who knows how to play on the nerves of his congregation.\r\nNothing is more disconcerting than to sit down, so to speak, before your\r\nprophet, and then suddenly to receive his boot in the pit of your\r\nstomach. \"I'm damned if I'll be humble after that,\" you cry, and so lay\r\nyourself open to further nagging. Also the subject matter of the sermon\r\nis agitating--hot denunciations or advice--so that in the end you cannot\r\nremember whether you ought or ought not to have a body, and are only\r\nsure that you are futile. This bullying, and the honeyed sweetness which\r\nis a bully's reaction, occupy between them the foreground of Lawrence's\r\nwork; his greatness lies far, far back, and rests, not like Dostoevsky's\r\nupon Christianity, nor like Melville's upon a contest, but upon\r\nsomething æsthetic. The voice is Balder's voice, though the hands are\r\nthe hands of Esau. The prophet is irradiating nature from within, so\r\nthat every colour has a glow and every form a distinctness which could\r\nnot otherwise be obtained. Take a scene that always stays in the memory:\r\nthat scene in _Women in Love_ where one of the characters throws stones\r\ninto the water at night to shatter the image of the moon. Why he throws,\r\nwhat the scene symbolizes, is unimportant. But the writer could not get\r\nsuch a moon and water otherwise; he reaches them by his special path\r\nwhich stamps them as more wonderful than any we can imagine. It is the\r\nprophet back where he started from, back where the rest of us are\r\nwaiting by the edge of the pool, but with a power of re-creation and\r\nevocation we shall never possess.\r\n\r\nHumility is not easy with this irritable and irritating author, for the\r\nhumbler we get, the crosser he gets. Yet I do not see how else to read\r\nhim. If we start resenting or mocking, his treasure disappears as surely\r\nas if we started obeying him. What is valuable about him cannot be put\r\ninto words; it is colour, gesture and outline in people and things, the\r\nusual stock-in-trade of the novelist, but evolved by such a different\r\nprocess that they belong to a new world.\r\n\r\nBut what about Emily Brontë? Why should _Wuthering Heights_ come into\r\nthis enquiry? It is a story about human beings, it contains no view of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nMy answer is that the emotions of Heathcliffe and Catherine Earnshaw\r\nfunction differently to other emotions in fiction. Instead of inhabiting\r\nthe characters, they surround them like thunder clouds, and generate the\r\nexplosions that fill the novel from the moment when Lockwood dreams of\r\nthe hand at the window down to the moment when Heathcliffe, with the\r\nsame window open, is discovered dead. _Wuthering Heights_ is filled with\r\nsound--storm and rushing wind--a sound more important than words and\r\nthoughts. Great as the novel is, one cannot afterwards remember anything\r\nin it but Heathcliffe and the elder Catherine. They cause the action by\r\ntheir separation: they close it by their union after death. No wonder\r\nthey \"walk\"; what else could such beings do? even when they were alive\r\ntheir love and hate transcended them.\r\n\r\nEmily Brontë had in some ways a literal and careful mind. She\r\nconstructed her novel on a time chart even more elaborate than Miss\r\nAusten's, and she arranged the Linton and Earnshaw families\r\nsymmetrically, and she had a clear idea of the various legal steps by\r\nwhich Heathcliffe gained possession of their two properties.[8] Then why\r\ndid she deliberately introduce muddle, chaos, tempest? Because in our\r\nsense of the word she was a prophetess: because what is implied is more\r\nimportant to her than what is said; and only in confusion could the\r\nfigures of Heathcliffe and Catherine externalize their passion till it\r\nstreamed through the house and over the moors. _Wuthering Heights_ has\r\nno mythology beyond what these two characters provide: no great book is\r\nmore cut off from the universals of Heaven and Hell. It is local, like\r\nthe spirits it engenders, and whereas we may meet Moby Dick in any pond,\r\nwe shall only encounter them among the harebells and limestone of their\r\nown county.\r\n\r\nA concluding remark. Always, at the back of my mind, there lurks a\r\nreservation about this prophetic stuff, a reservation which some will\r\nmake more strongly while others will not make it at all. Fantasy has\r\nasked us to pay something extra; and now prophecy asks for humility and\r\neven for a suspension of the sense of humour, so that we are not allowed\r\nto snigger when a tragedy is called _Billy Budd_. We have indeed to lay\r\naside the single vision which we bring to most of literature and life\r\nand have been trying to use through most of our enquiry, and take up a\r\ndifferent set of tools. Is this right? Another prophet, Blake, had no\r\ndoubt that it was right.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         May God us keep\r\n    From single vision and Newton's sleep,\r\n\r\n\r\nhe cried and he has painted that same Newton with a pair of compasses in\r\nhis hand, describing a miserable mathematical triangle, and turning his\r\nback upon the gorgeous and immeasurable water growths of _Moby Dick_.\r\nFew will agree with Blake. Fewer will agree with Blake's Newton. Most of\r\nus will be eclectics to this side or that according to our temperament.\r\nThe human mind is not a dignified organ, and I do not see how we can\r\nexercise it sincerely except through eclecticism. And the only advice I\r\nwould offer my fellow eclectics is: \"Do not be proud of your\r\ninconsistency. It is a pity, it is a pity that we should be equipped\r\nlike this. It is a pity that Man cannot be at the same time impressive\r\nand truthful.\" For the first five lectures of this course we have used\r\nmore or less the same set of tools. This time and last we have had to\r\nlay them down. Next time we shall take them up again, but with no\r\ncertainty that they are the best equipment for a critic or that there is\r\nsuch a thing as a critical equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Only to be found in a collected edition.

(Hogarth Press.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPATTERN AND RHYTHM\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR interludes, gay and grave, are over, and we return to the general\r\nscheme of the course. We began with the story, and having considered\r\nhuman beings, we proceeded to the plot which springs out of the story.\r\nNow we must consider something which springs mainly out of the plot, and\r\nto which the characters and any other element present also contribute.\r\nFor this new aspect there appears to be no literary word--indeed the\r\nmore the arts develop the more they depend on each other for definition.\r\nWe will borrow from painting first and call it the pattern. Later we\r\nwill borrow from music and call it rhythm. Unfortunately both these\r\nwords are vague--when people apply rhythm or pattern to literature they\r\nare apt not to say what they mean and not to finish their sentences: it\r\nis, \"Oh, but surely the rhythm ...\" or \"Oh, but if you call that\r\npattern ...\"\r\n\r\nBefore I discuss what pattern entails, and what qualities a reader must\r\nbring to its appreciation, I will give two examples of books with\r\npatterns so definite that a pictorial image sums them up: a book the\r\nshape of an hour-glass and a book the shape of a grand chain in that\r\nold-time dance, the Lancers.\r\n\r\n_Thais_, by Anatole France, is the shape of an hour-glass.\r\n\r\nThere are two chief characters, Paphnuce the ascetic, Thais the\r\ncourtesan. Paphnuce lives in the desert, he is saved and happy when the\r\nbook starts. Thais leads a life of sin in Alexandria, and it is his duty\r\nto save her. In the central scene of the book they approach, he\r\nsucceeds; she goes into a monastery and gains salvation, because she has\r\nmet him, but he, because he has met her, is damned. The two characters\r\nconverge, cross, and recede with mathematical precision, and part of the\r\npleasure we get from the book is due to this. Such is the pattern of\r\nThais--so simple that it makes a good starting-point for a difficult\r\nsurvey. It is the same as the story of _Thais_, when events unroll in\r\ntheir time-sequence, and the same as the plot of _Thais_, when we see\r\nthe two characters bound by their previous actions and taking fatal\r\nsteps whose consequence they do not see. But whereas the story appeals\r\nto our curiosity and the plot to our intelligence, the pattern appeals\r\nto our æsthetic sense, it causes us to see the book as a whole. We do\r\nnot see it as an hour-glass--that is the hard jargon of the lecture room\r\nwhich must never be taken literally at this advanced stage of our\r\nenquiry. We just have a pleasure without knowing why, and when the\r\npleasure is past, as it is now, and our minds are left free to explain\r\nit, a geometrical simile such as an hour-glass will be found helpful. If\r\nit was not for this hour-glass the story, the plot, and the characters\r\nof Thais and Paphnuce would none of them exert their full force, they\r\nwould none of them breathe as they do. \"Pattern,\" which seems so rigid,\r\nis connected with atmosphere, which seems so fluid.\r\n\r\nNow for the book that is shaped like the grand chain: _Roman Pictures_\r\nby Percy Lubbock.\r\n\r\n_Roman Pictures_ is a social comedy. The narrator is a tourist in Rome;\r\nhe there meets a kindly and shoddy friend of his, Deering, who rebukes\r\nhim superciliously for staring at churches and sets him out to explore\r\nsociety. This he does, demurely obedient; one person hands him on to\r\nanother; café, studio, Vatican and Quirinal purlieus are all reached,\r\nuntil finally, at the extreme end of his career he thinks, in a most\r\naristocratic and dilapidated palazzo, whom should he meet but the\r\nsecond-rate Deering; Deering is his hostess's nephew, but had concealed\r\nit owing to some backfire of snobbery. The circle is complete, the\r\noriginal partners have rejoined, and greet one another with mutual\r\nconfusion which turns to mild laughter.\r\n\r\nWhat is so good in _Roman Pictures_ is not the presence of the \"grand\r\nchain\" pattern--any one can organize a grand chain--but the suitability\r\nof the pattern to the author's mood. Lubbock works all through by\r\nadministering a series of little shocks, and by extending to his\r\ncharacters an elaborate charity which causes them to appear in a rather\r\nworse light than if no charity was wasted on them at all. It is the\r\ncomic atmosphere, but sub-acid, meticulously benign. And at the end we\r\ndiscover to our delight that the atmosphere has been externalized, and\r\nthat the partners, as they elide together in the marchesa's\r\ndrawing-room, have done the exact thing which the book requires, which\r\nit required from the start, and have bound the scattered incidents\r\ntogether with a thread woven out of their own substance.\r\n\r\n_Thais_ and _Roman Pictures_ provide easy examples of pattern; it is not\r\noften that one can compare a book to a pictorial object with any\r\naccuracy, though curves, etc., are freely spoken of by critics who do\r\nnot quite know what they want to say. We can only say (so far) that\r\npattern is an æsthetic aspect of the novel, and that though it may be\r\nnourished by anything in the novel--any character, scene, word--it draws\r\nmost of its nourishment from the plot. We noted, when discussing the\r\nplot, that it added to itself the quality of beauty; beauty a little\r\nsurprised at her own arrival: that upon its neat carpentry there could\r\nbe seen, by those who cared to see, the figure of the Muse; that Logic,\r\nat the moment of finishing its own house, laid the foundation of a new\r\none. Here, here is the point where the aspect called pattern is most\r\nclosely in touch with its material; here is our starting point. It\r\nsprings mainly from the plot, accompanies it like a light in the clouds,\r\nand remains visible after it has departed. Beauty is sometimes the shape\r\nof the book, the book as a whole, the unity, and our examination would\r\nbe easier if it was always this. But sometimes it is not. When it is not\r\nI shall call it rhythm. For the moment we are concerned with pattern\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nLet us examine at some length another book of the rigid type, a book\r\nwith a unity, and in this sense an easy book, although it is by Henry\r\nJames. We shall see in it pattern triumphant, and we shall also be able\r\nto see the sacrifices an author must make if he wants his pattern and\r\nnothing else to triumph.\r\n\r\n_The Ambassadors_, like _Thais_, is the shape of an hour-glass. Strether\r\nand Chad, like Paphnuce and Thais, change places, and it is the\r\nrealization of this that makes the book so satisfying at the close. The\r\nplot is elaborate and subtle, and proceeds by action or conversation or\r\nmeditation through every paragraph. Everything is planned, everything\r\nfits; none of the minor characters are just decorative like the\r\ntalkative Alexandrians at Nirias' banquet; they elaborate on the main\r\ntheme, they work. The final effect is pre-arranged, dawns gradually on\r\nthe reader, and is completely successful when it comes. Details of\r\nintrigue, of the various missions from America, may be forgotten, but\r\nthe symmetry they have created is enduring.\r\n\r\nLet us trace the growth of this symmetry.[9]\r\n\r\nStrether, a sensitive middle-aged American, is commissioned by his old\r\nfriend, Mrs. Newsome, whom he hopes to marry, to go to Paris and rescue\r\nher son Chad, who has gone to the bad in that appropriate city. The\r\nNewsomes are sound commercial people, who have made money over\r\nmanufacturing a small article of domestic utility. Henry James never\r\ntells us what the small article is, and in a moment we shall understand\r\nwhy. Wells spits it out in _Tono Bungay_, Meredith reels it out in _Evan\r\nHarrington_, Trollope prescribes it freely for Miss Dunstable, but for\r\nJames to indicate how his characters made their pile--it would not do.\r\nThe article is somewhat ignoble and ludicrous--that is enough. If you\r\nchoose to be coarse and daring and visualize it for yourself as, say, a\r\nbutton-hook, you can, but you do so at your own risk: the author remains\r\nuninvolved.\r\n\r\nWell, whatever it is, Chad Newsome ought to come back and help make it,\r\nand Strether undertakes to fetch him. He has to be rescued from a life\r\nwhich is both immoral and unremunerative.\r\n\r\nStrether is a typical James character--he recurs in nearly all the books\r\nand is an essential part of their construction. He is the observer who\r\ntries to influence the action, and who through his failure to do so\r\ngains extra opportunities for observation. And the other characters are\r\nsuch as an observer like Strether is capable of observing--through\r\nlenses procured from a rather too first-class oculist. Everything is\r\nadjusted to his vision, yet he is not a quietist--no, that is the\r\nstrength of the device; he takes us along with him, we move as well as\r\nlook on.\r\n\r\nWhen he lands in England (and a landing is an exalted and enduring\r\nexperience for James, it is as vital as Newgate for Defoe; poetry and\r\nlife crowd round a landing): when Strether lands, though it is only old\r\nEngland, he begins to have doubts of his mission, which increase when he\r\ngets to Paris. For Chad Newsome, far from going to the bad, has\r\nimproved; he is distinguished, he is so sure of himself that he can be\r\nkind and cordial to the man who has orders to fetch him away; his\r\nfriends are exquisite, and as for \"women in the case\" whom his mother\r\nanticipated, there is no sign of them whatever. It is Paris that has\r\nenlarged and redeemed him--and how well Strether himself understands\r\nthis!\r\n\r\n\r\nHis greatest uneasiness seemed to peep at him out of the possible\r\nimpression that almost any acceptance of Paris might give one's\r\nauthority away. It hung before him this morning, the vast bright\r\nBabylon, like some huge iridescent object, a jewel brilliant and hard,\r\nin which parts were not to be discriminated nor differences comfortably\r\nmarked. It twinkled and trembled and melted together; and what seemed\r\nall surface one moment seemed all depth the next. It was a place of\r\nwhich, unmistakably, Chad was fond; wherefore, if he, Strether, should\r\nlike it too much, what on earth, with such a bond, would become of\r\neither of them?\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, exquisitely and firmly, James sets his atmosphere--Paris\r\nirradiates the book from end to end, it is an actor though always\r\nunembodied, it is a scale by which human sensibility can be measured,\r\nand when we have finished the novel and allow its incidents to blur that\r\nwe may see the pattern plainer, it is Paris that gleams at the centre of\r\nthe hour-glass shape--Paris--nothing so crude as good or evil. Strether\r\nsees this soon, and sees that Chad realizes it better than he himself\r\ncan; and when he has reached this stage of initiation the novel takes a\r\nturn: there is, after all, a woman in the case; behind Paris,\r\ninterpreting it for Chad, is the adorable and exalted figure of Mme. de\r\nVionnet. It is now impossible for Strether to proceed. All that is noble\r\nand refined in life concentrates in Mme. de Vionnet and is reinforced by\r\nher pathos. She asks him not to take Chad away. He promises--without\r\nreluctance, for his own heart has already shown him as much--and he\r\nremains in Paris not to fight it but to fight for it.\r\n\r\nFor the second batch of ambassadors now arrives from the New World. Mrs.\r\nNewsome, incensed and puzzled by the unseemly delay, has despatched\r\nChad's sister, his brother-in-law, and Mamie, the girl whom he is\r\nsupposed to marry. The novel now becomes, within its ordained limits,\r\nmost amusing. There is a superb set-to between Chad's sister and Mme. de\r\nVionnet, while as for Mamie--here is disastrous Mamie, seen as we see\r\nall things, through Strether's eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a child, as a \"bud,\" and then again as a flower of expansion, Mamie\r\nhad bloomed for him, freely, in the almost incessantly open doorways of\r\nhome; where he remembered her at first very forward, as then very\r\nbackward--for he had carried on at one period, in Mrs. Newsome's\r\nparlours, a course of English literature reinforced by exams and\r\nteas--and once more, finally, as very much in advance. But he had kept\r\nno great sense of points of contact; it not being in the nature of\r\nthings at Woollett that the freshest of the buds should find herself in\r\nthe same basket with the most withered of the winter apples.... He none\r\nthe less felt now, as he sat with the charming girl, the signal growth\r\nof a confidence. For she _was_ charming, when all was said, and none the\r\nless so for the visible habit and practice of freedom and fluency. She\r\nwas charming, he was aware, in spite of the fact that if he hadn't found\r\nher so he would have found her something he should have been in peril of\r\nexpressing as \"funny.\" Yes, she was funny, wonderful Mamie, and without\r\ndreaming it; she was bland, she was bridal--with never, that he could\r\nmake out as yet, a bridegroom to support it; she was handsome and\r\nportly, and easy and chatty, soft and sweet and almost disconcertingly\r\nreassuring. She was dressed, if we might so far discriminate, less as a\r\nyoung lady than as an old one--had an old one been supposable to\r\nStrether as so committed to vanity; the complexities of her hair missed\r\nmoreover also the looseness of youth; and she had a mature manner of\r\nbending a little, as to encourage and reward, while she held neatly in\r\nfront of her a pair of strikingly polished hands: the combination of all\r\nof which kept up about her the glamour of her \"receiving,\" placed her\r\nagain perpetually between the windows and within sound of the ice cream\r\nplates, suggested the enumeration of all the names, gregarious specimens\r\nof a single type, she was happy to \"meet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMamie! She is another Henry James type; nearly every novel contains a\r\nMamie--Mrs. Gereth in _The Spoils of Poynton_ for instance, or Henrietta\r\nStackpole in _The Portrait of a Lady_. He is so good at indicating\r\ninstantaneously and constantly that a character is second rate,\r\ndeficient in sensitiveness, abounding in the wrong sort of worldliness;\r\nhe gives such a character so much vitality that its absurdity is\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nSo Strether changes sides and loses all hopes of marrying Mrs. Newsome.\r\nParis is winning--and then he catches sight of something new. Is not\r\nChad, as regards any fineness in him, played out? Is not Chad's Paris\r\nafter all just a place for a spree? This fear is confirmed. He goes for\r\na solitary country walk, and at the end of the day he comes across Chad\r\nand Mme. de Vionnet. They are in a boat, they pretend not to see him,\r\nbecause their relation is at bottom an ordinary liaison, and they are\r\nashamed. They were hoping for a secret week-end at an inn while their\r\npassion survived; for it will not survive, Chad will tire of the\r\nexquisite Frenchwoman, she is part of his fling; he will go back to his\r\nmother and make the little domestic article and marry Mamie. They know\r\nall this, and it is revealed to Strether though they try to hide it;\r\nthey lie, they are vulgar--even Mme. de Vionnet, even her pathos, once\r\nso exquisite, is stained with commonness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was like a chill in the air to him, it was almost appalling, that a\r\ncreature so fine could be, by mysterious forces, a creature so\r\nexploited. For, at the end of all things, they _were_ mysterious; she\r\nhad but made Chad what he was--so why could she think she had made him\r\ninfinite? She had made him better, she had made him best, she had made\r\nhim anything one would; but it came to our friend with supreme queerness\r\nthat he was none the less only Chad. The work, however admirable, was\r\nnevertheless of the strict human order, and in short it was\r\nmarvellous that the companion of mere earthly joys, of comforts,\r\naberrations--however one classed them--within the common experience,\r\nshould be so transcendency prized.\r\n\r\nShe was older for him tonight, visibly less exempt from the touch of\r\ntime; but she was as much as ever the finest and subtlest creature, the\r\nhappiest apparition, it had been given him, in all his years, to meet;\r\nand yet he could see her there as vulgarly troubled, in very truth, as a\r\nmaidservant crying for a young man. The only thing was that she judged\r\nherself as the maidservant wouldn't; the weakness of which wisdom too,\r\nthe dishonour of which judgment, seemed but to sink her lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Strether loses them too. As he says: \"I have lost everything--it is\r\nmy only logic.\" It is not that they have gone back. It is that he has\r\ngone on. The Paris they revealed to him--he could reveal it to them now,\r\nif they had eyes to see, for it is something finer than they could ever\r\nnotice for themselves, and his imagination has more spiritual value than\r\ntheir youth. The pattern of the hour-glass is complete; he and Chad have\r\nchanged places, with more subtle steps than Thais and Paphnuce, and the\r\nlight in the clouds proceeds not from the well-lit Alexandria, but from\r\nthe jewel which \"twinkled and trembled and melted together, and what\r\nseemed all surface one moment seemed all depth the next.\"\r\n\r\nThe beauty that suffuses _The Ambassadors_ is the reward due to a fine\r\nartist for hard work. James knew exactly what he wanted, he pursued the\r\nnarrow path of æsthetic duty, and success to the full extent of his\r\npossibilities has crowned him. The pattern has woven itself with\r\nmodulation and reservations Anatole France will never attain. Woven\r\nitself wonderfully. But at what sacrifice!\r\n\r\nSo enormous is the sacrifice that many readers cannot get interested in\r\nJames, although they can follow what he says (his difficulty has been\r\nmuch exaggerated), and can appreciate his effects. They cannot grant his\r\npremise, which is that most of human life has to disappear before he can\r\ndo us a novel.\r\n\r\nHe has, in the first place, a very short list of characters. I have\r\nalready mentioned two--the observer who tries to influence the action,\r\nand the second-rate outsider (to whom, for example, all the brilliant\r\nopening of _What Maisie Knew_ is entrusted). Then there is the\r\nsympathetic foil--very lively and frequently female--in _The\r\nAmbassadors_. Maria Gostrey plays this part; there is the wonderful rare\r\nheroine, whom Mme. de Vionnet approached and who is consummated by Milly\r\nin _The Wings of the Dove_; there is sometimes a villain, sometimes a\r\nyoung artist with generous impulses; and that is about all. For so fine\r\na novelist it is a poor show.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the characters, beside being few in number, are\r\nconstructed on very stingy lines. They are incapable of fun, of rapid\r\nmotion, of carnality, and of nine-tenths of heroism. Their clothes will\r\nnot take off, the diseases that ravage them are anonymous, like the\r\nsources of their income, their servants are noiseless or resemble\r\nthemselves, no social explanation of the world we know is possible for\r\nthem, for there are no stupid people in their world, no barriers of\r\nlanguage, and no poor. Even their sensations are limited. They can land\r\nin Europe and look at works of art and at each other, but that is all.\r\nMaimed creatures can alone breathe in Henry James's pages--maimed yet\r\nspecialized. They remind one of the exquisite deformities who haunted\r\nEgyptian art in the reign of Akhenaton--huge heads and tiny legs, but\r\nnevertheless charming. In the following reign they disappear.\r\n\r\nNow this drastic curtailment, both of the numbers of human beings and of\r\ntheir attributes, is in the interests of the pattern. The longer James\r\nworked, the more convinced he grew that a novel should be a whole--not\r\nnecessarily geometric like _The Ambassadors_, but it should accrete\r\nround a single topic, situation, gesture, which should occupy the\r\ncharacters and provide a plot, and should also fasten up the novel on\r\nthe outside--catch its scattered statements in a net, make them cohere\r\nlike a planet, and swing through the skies of memory. A pattern must\r\nemerge, and anything that emerged from the pattern must be pruned off as\r\nwanton distraction. Who so wanton as human beings? Put Tom Jones or Emma\r\nor even Mr. Casaubon into a Henry James book, and the book will burn to\r\nashes, whereas we could put them into one another's books and only cause\r\nlocal inflammation. Only a Henry James character will suit, and though\r\nthey are not dead--certain selected recesses of experience he explores\r\nvery well--they are gutted of the common stuff that fills characters in\r\nother books, and ourselves. And this castrating is not in the interests\r\nof the Kingdom of Heaven, there is no philosophy in the novels, no\r\nreligion (except an occasional touch of superstition), no prophecy, no\r\nbenefit for the superhuman at all. It is for the sake of a particular\r\næsthetic effect which is certainly gained, but at this heavy price.\r\n\r\nH. G. Wells has been amusing on this point, and perhaps profound. In\r\n_Boon_--one of his liveliest works--he had Henry James much upon his\r\nmind, and wrote a superb parody of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames begins by taking it for granted that a novel is a work of art that\r\nmust be judged by its oneness. Some one gave him that idea in the\r\nbeginning of things and he has never found it out. He doesn't find\r\nthings out. He doesn't even seem to want to find things out. He accepts\r\nvery readily and then--elaborates.... The only living human motives left\r\nin his novels are a certain avidity and an entirely superficial\r\ncuriosity.... His people nose out suspicions, hint by hint, link by\r\nlink. Have you ever known living human beings do that? The thing his\r\nnovel is _about_ is always there. It is like a church lit but with no\r\ncongregation to distract you, with every light and line focussed on the\r\nhigh altar. And on the altar, very reverently placed, intensely there,\r\nis a dead kitten, an egg shell, a piece of string.... Like his _Altar of\r\nthe Dead_ with nothing to the dead at all.... For if there was, they\r\ncouldn't all be candles, and the effect would vanish.\r\n\r\n\r\nWells sent _Boon_ as a present to James, apparently thinking the master\r\nwould be as much pleased by such heartiness and honesty as was he\r\nhimself. The master was far from pleased, and a most interesting\r\ncorrespondence ensued.[10] Each of the eminent men becomes more and more\r\nhimself as it proceeds. James is polite, reminiscent, bewildered, and\r\nexceedingly formidable: he admits that the parody has not \"filled him\r\nwith a fond elation,\" and regrets in conclusion that he can sign himself\r\n\"only yours faithfully, Henry James.\" Wells is bewildered too, but in a\r\ndifferent way; he cannot understand why the man should be upset. And,\r\nbeyond the personal comedy, there is the great literary importance of\r\nthe issue. It is this question of the rigid pattern: hour-glass or grand\r\nchain or converging lines of the cathedral or diverging lines of the\r\nCatherine wheel, or bed of Procrustes--whatever image you like as long\r\nas it implies unity. Can it be combined with the immense richness of\r\nmaterial which life provides? Wells and James would agree it cannot,\r\nWells would go on to say that life should be given the preference, and\r\nmust not be whittled or distended for a pattern's sake. My own\r\nprejudices are with Wells. The James novels are a unique possession and\r\nthe reader who cannot accept his premises misses some valuable and\r\nexquisite sensations. But I do not want more of his novels, especially\r\nwhen they are written by some one else, just as I do not want the art of\r\nAkhenaton to extend into the reign of Tutankhamen.\r\n\r\nThat then is the disadvantage of a rigid pattern. It may externalize the\r\natmosphere, spring naturally from the plot, but it shuts the doors on\r\nlife and leaves the novelist doing exercises, generally in the\r\ndrawing-room. Beauty has arrived, but in too tyrannous a guise. In\r\nplays--the plays of Racine, for instance--she may be justified because\r\nbeauty can be a great empress on the stage, and reconcile us to the loss\r\nof the men we knew. But in the novel, her tyranny as it grows powerful\r\ngrows petty, and generates regrets which sometimes take the form of\r\nbooks like _Boon_. To put it in other words, the novel is not capable of\r\nas much artistic development as the drama: its humanity or the grossness\r\nof its material hinder it (use whichever phrase you like). To most\r\nreaders of fiction the sensation from a pattern is not intense enough to\r\njustify the sacrifices that made it, and their verdict is \"Beautifully\r\ndone, but not worth doing.\"\r\n\r\nStill this is not the end of our quest. We will not give up the hope of\r\nbeauty yet. Cannot it be introduced into fiction by some other method\r\nthan the pattern? Let us edge rather nervously towards the idea of\r\n\"rhythm.\"\r\n\r\nRhythm is sometimes quite easy. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, for\r\ninstance, starts with the rhythm \"diddidy dum,\" which we can all hear\r\nand tap to. But the symphony as a whole has also a rhythm--due mainly to\r\nthe relation between its movements--which some people can hear but no\r\none can tap to. This second sort of rhythm is difficult, and whether it\r\nis substantially the same as the first sort only a musician could tell\r\nus. What a literary man wants to say though is that the first kind of\r\nrhythm, the diddidy dum, can be found in certain novels and may give\r\nthem beauty. And the other rhythm, the difficult one--the rhythm of the\r\nFifth Symphony as a whole--I cannot quote you any parallels for that in\r\nfiction, yet it may be present.\r\n\r\nRhythm in the easy sense, is illustrated by the work of Marcel\r\nProust.[11]\r\n\r\nProust's conclusion has not been published yet, and his admirers say\r\nthat when it comes everything will fall into its place, times past will\r\nbe recaptured and fixed, we shall have a perfect whole. I do not believe\r\nthis. The work seems to me a progressive rather than an æsthetic\r\nconfession, and with the elaboration of Albertine the author was getting\r\ntired. Bits of news may await us, but it will be surprising if we have\r\nto revise our opinion of the whole book. The book is chaotic, ill\r\nconstructed, it has and will have no external shape; and yet it hangs\r\ntogether because it is stitched internally, because it contains rhythms.\r\n\r\nThere are several examples (the photographing of the grandmother is one\r\nof them) but the most important from the binding point of view is his\r\nuse of the \"little phrase\" in the music of Vinteuil. It does more than\r\nanything else--more even than the jealousy which successively destroys\r\nSwann, the hero, and Charlus--to make us feel that we are in a\r\nhomogeneous world. We first hear Vinteuil's name in hideous\r\ncircumstances. The musician is dead--an obscure little country organist,\r\nunknown to fame--and his daughter is defiling his memory. The horrible\r\nscene is to radiate in several directions, but it passes, we forget\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThen we are at a Paris salon. A violin sonata is performed and a little\r\nphrase from its andante catches the ear of Swann and steals into his\r\nlife. It is always a living being, but takes various forms. For a time\r\nit attends his love for Odette. The love affair goes wrong, the phrase\r\nis forgotten, we forget it. Then it breaks out again when he is ravaged\r\nby jealousy, and now it attends his misery and past happiness at once,\r\nwithout losing its own divine character. Who wrote the sonata? On\r\nhearing it is by Vinteuil, Swann says, \"I once knew a wretched little\r\norganist of that name--it couldn't be by him.\" But it is, and Vinteuil's\r\ndaughter and her friend transcribed and published it.\r\n\r\nThat seems all. The little phrase crosses the book again and again, but\r\nas an echo, a memory; we like to encounter it, but it has no binding\r\npower. Then, hundreds and hundreds of pages on, when Vinteuil has become\r\na national possession, and there is talk of raising a statue to him in\r\nthe town where he has been so wretched and so obscure, another work of\r\nhis is performed--a posthumous sextet. The hero listens--he is in an\r\nunknown rather terrible universe while a sinister dawn reddens the sea.\r\nSuddenly for him and for the reader too, the little phrase of the sonata\r\nrecurs--half heard, changed, but giving complete orientation, so that he\r\nis back in the country of his childhood with the knowledge that it\r\nbelongs to the unknown.\r\n\r\nWe are not obliged to agree with Proust's actual musical descriptions\r\n(they are too pictorial for my own taste): but what we must admire is\r\nhis use of rhythm in literature, and his use of something which is akin\r\nby nature to the effect it has to produce--namely a musical phrase.\r\nHeard by various people--first by Swann, then by the hero--the phrase of\r\nVinteuil is not tethered; it is not a banner such as we find George\r\nMeredith using--a double-blossomed cherry tree to accompany Clara\r\nMiddleton, a yacht in smooth waters for Cecilia Halkett. A banner can\r\nonly reappear, rhythm can develop, and the little phrase has a life of\r\nits own, unconnected with the lives of its auditors, as with the life of\r\nthe man who composed it. It is almost an actor, but not quite, and that\r\n\"not quite\" means that its power has gone towards stitching Proust's\r\nbook together from the inside, and towards the establishment of beauty\r\nand the ravishing of the reader's memory. There are times when the\r\nlittle phrase--from its gloomy inception, through the sonata into the\r\nsextet--means everything to the reader. There are times when it means\r\nnothing and is forgotten, and this seems to me the function of rhythm in\r\nfiction; not to be there all the time like a pattern, but by its lovely\r\nwaxing and waning to fill us with surprise and freshness and hope.\r\n\r\nDone badly, rhythm is most boring, it hardens into a symbol and instead\r\nof carrying us on it trips us up. With exasperation we find that\r\nGalsworthy's spaniel John, or whatever it is, lies under the feet again;\r\nand even Meredith's cherry trees and yachts, graceful as they are, only\r\nopen the windows into poetry. I doubt that it can be achieved by the\r\nwriters who plan their books beforehand, it has to depend on a local\r\nimpulse when the right interval is reached. But the effect can be\r\nexquisite, it can be obtained without mutilating the characters, and it\r\nlessens our need of an external form.\r\n\r\nThat must suffice on the subject of easy rhythm in fiction: which may be\r\ndefined as repetition plus variation, and which can be illustrated by\r\nexamples. Now for the more difficult question. Is there any effect in\r\nnovels comparable to the effect of the Fifth Symphony as a whole,\r\nwhere, when the orchestra stops, we hear something that has never\r\nactually been played? The opening movement, the andante, and the\r\ntrio-scherzo-trio-finale-trio-finale that composes the third block, all\r\nenter the mind at once, and extend one another into a common entity.\r\nThis common entity, this new thing, is the symphony as a whole, and it\r\nhas been achieved mainly (though not entirely) by the relation between\r\nthe three big blocks of sound which the orchestra has been playing. I am\r\ncalling this relation \"rhythmic.\" If the correct musical term is\r\nsomething else, that does not matter; what we have now to ask ourselves\r\nis whether there is any analogy to it in fiction.\r\n\r\nI cannot find any analogy. Yet there may be one; in music fiction is\r\nlikely to find its nearest parallel.\r\n\r\nThe position of the drama is different. The drama may look towards the\r\npictorial arts, it may allow Aristotle to discipline it, for it is not\r\nso deeply committed to the claims of human beings. Human beings have\r\ntheir great chance in the novel. They say to the novelist: \"Recreate us\r\nif you like, but we must come in,\" and the novelist's problem, as we\r\nhave seen all along, is to give them a good run and to achieve something\r\nelse at the same time. Whither shall he turn? not indeed for help but\r\nfor analogy. Music, though it does not employ human beings, though it is\r\ngoverned by intricate laws, nevertheless does offer in its final\r\nexpression a type of beauty which fiction might achieve in its own way.\r\nExpansion. That is the idea the novelist must cling to. Not completion.\r\nNot rounding off but opening out. When the symphony is over we feel that\r\nthe notes and tunes composing it have been liberated, they have found in\r\nthe rhythm of the whole their individual freedom. Cannot the novel be\r\nlike that? Is not there something of it in _War and Peace_?--the book\r\nwith which we began and in which we must end. Such an untidy book. Yet,\r\nas we read it, do not great chords begin to sound behind us, and when we\r\nhave finished does not every item--even the catalogue of\r\nstrategies--lead a larger existence than was possible at the time?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: There is a masterly analysis of _The Ambassadors_\r\nfrom another standpoint in _The Craft of Fiction_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See the _Letters of H. James_, Vol. II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The first three books of _À la recherche du temps\r\nperdu_ have been excellently translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff\r\nunder the title of _Remembrance of Things Past_. (A. & C. Boni.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is tempting to conclude by speculations as to the future of the\r\nnovel, will it become more or less realistic, will it be killed by the\r\ncinema, and so on. Speculations, whether sad or lively, always have a\r\nlarge air about them, they are a very convenient way of being helpful or\r\nimpressive. But we have no right to entertain them. We have refused to\r\nbe hampered by the past, so we must not profit by the future. We have\r\nvisualized the novelists of the last two hundred years all writing\r\ntogether in one room, subject to the same emotions and putting the\r\naccidents of their age into the crucible of inspiration, and whatever\r\nour results, our method has been sound--sound for an assemblage of\r\npseudo-scholars like ourselves. But we must visualize the novelists of\r\nthe next two hundred years as also writing in the room. The change in\r\ntheir subject matter will be enormous; they will not change. We may\r\nharness the atom, we may land on the moon, we may abolish or intensify\r\nwarfare, the mental processes of animals may be understood; but all\r\nthese are trifles, they belong to history not to art. History develops,\r\nart stands still. The novelist of the future will have to pass all the\r\nnew facts through the old if variable mechanism of the creative mind.\r\n\r\nThere is however one question which touches our subject, and which only\r\na psychologist could answer. But let us ask it. Will the creative\r\nprocess itself alter? Will the mirror get a new coat of quicksilver? In\r\nother words, can human nature change? Let us consider this possibility\r\nfor a moment--we are entitled to that much relaxation.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to listen to elderly people on this subject. Sometimes a\r\nman says in confident tones: \"Human nature's the same in all ages. The\r\nprimitive cave man lies deep in us all. Civilization--pooh! a mere\r\nveneer. You can't alter facts.\" He speaks like this when he is feeling\r\nprosperous and fat. When he is feeling depressed and is worried by the\r\nyoung, or is being sentimental about them on the ground that they will\r\nsucceed in life when he has failed, then he will take the opposite view\r\nand say mysteriously, \"Human nature is not the same. I have seen\r\nfundamental changes in my own time. You must face facts.\" And he goes on\r\nlike this day after day, alternately facing facts and refusing to alter\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll I will do is to state a possibility. If human nature does alter it\r\nwill be because individuals manage to look at themselves in a new way.\r\nHere and there people--a very few people, but a few novelists are among\r\nthem--are trying to do this. Every institution and vested interest is\r\nagainst such a search: organized religion, the State, the family in its\r\neconomic aspect, have nothing to gain, and it is only when outward\r\nprohibitions weaken that it can proceed: history conditions it to that\r\nextent. Perhaps the searchers will fail, perhaps it is impossible for\r\nthe instrument of contemplation to contemplate itself, perhaps if it is\r\npossible it means the end of imaginative literature--which if I\r\nunderstand him rightly is the view of that acute enquirer, Mr. I. A.\r\nRichards. Anyhow--that way lies movement and even combustion for the\r\nnovel, for if the novelist sees himself differently he will see his\r\ncharacters differently and a new system of lighting will result.\r\n\r\nI do not know on the verge of which philosophy or what rival\r\nphilosophies the above remarks are wavering, but as I look back at my\r\nown scraps of knowledge and into my own heart, I see these two movements\r\nof the human mind: the great tedious onrush known as history, and a shy\r\ncrablike sideways movement. Both movements have been neglected in these\r\nlectures: history because it only carries people on, it is just a train\r\nfull of passengers; and the crablike movement because it is too slow and\r\ncautious to be visible over our tiny period of two hundred years. So we\r\nlaid it down as an axiom when we started that human nature is\r\nunchangeable, and that it produces in rapid succession prose fictions,\r\nwhich fictions, when they contain 50,000 words or more, are called\r\nnovels. If we had the power or license to take a wider view, and survey\r\nall human and pre-human activity, we might not conclude like this; the\r\ncrablike movement, the shiftings of the passengers, might be visible,\r\nand the phrase \"the development of the novel\" might cease to be a\r\npseudo-scholarly tag or a technical triviality, and become important,\r\nbecause it implied the development of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF MAIN REFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alain, 73-74\r\n  Aristotle, 126-129\r\n  Asquith, Mr., 161\r\n  Austen, Jane, 100-101, 112-114\r\n\r\n  Beerbohm, Max, 171-175\r\n  Bennett, Arnold, 62-63\r\n  Birth, treatment of, 76-77,\r\n    81-82\r\n  Blake, William, 211\r\n  Brontë, Charlotte, 139-140\r\n  Brontë, Emily, 209-211\r\n\r\n  C.
