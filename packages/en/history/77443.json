Thus\r\nfar, yea, and hundreds of miles farther, did the Roman power extend in\r\nthis, the twelfth year of the reign of the Emperor Nero. Crispus’ stern\r\nsmile gave the keynote to his character--pride in the Empire founded by\r\nhis forefathers, determination to maintain that Empire, though it cost\r\nhim limb and life.\r\n\r\nAnd in truth Rome counted few sons more patriotic than young Crispus\r\nCestius Gallus, distinguished alike by feats of arms and by beauty\r\nof person; by noble birth, and by high office--for he was secretary\r\nto his father, the elder Cestius, who at that time held the dignity\r\nof imperial Legate of Syria, a dignity whose vast power and splendid\r\nemoluments made it a prize coveted of all Roman statesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely evening. A faint breeze came from the sea, whose\r\nwaves, wine-dark in color, flowed with a sort of velvety ripple upon\r\nthe yellow sands. To the east at the distance of a mile or more rose\r\nthe Samaritan hills, mysterious and still in the evening light, their\r\nrounded summits clearly defined against the deep violet of the sky.\r\n\r\nNow, as Crispus glanced ahead, he saw approaching a solitary figure,\r\nwearing buskins of purple, and a sleeved and embroidered tunic of the\r\nsame color, cut to the latest fashion. He walked, his eyes set upon the\r\nground, with a somewhat slow and pensive step, and would have passed by\r\nunheeding but for the cheery, rousing voice of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Ho, Titus! Is it thus in a strange land that you pass by your oldest\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\nHe who was thus addressed started, looked up, and, recognizing the\r\nspeaker, dropped as if by magic his melancholy air, and advanced with\r\nsmiling face and extended hand.\r\n\r\n“By the gods, ’tis Crispus,” he cried in a tone of genuine delight.\r\n“Now doth Fortune favor me. To think of meeting you in this barbarian\r\nprovince, a thousand miles from our Sabine farms! Whither are you\r\nbound? For Cæsarea? Then will I return with you.”\r\n\r\nTitus Flavius, destined in course of time to attain the imperial\r\npurple, was the senior of Crispus by one year: keen of eye, and with an\r\naquiline nose, he looked every inch the soldier that he was, in spite\r\nof his perfumed and fashionable garb. A certain ruddiness of features\r\nshowed him to be likewise a sort of “Antony, that revels long o’\r\nnights.”\r\n\r\n“What do _you_ in this Jewish land?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Rejoice at my presence here, for ’tis proof that I am restored to\r\nNero’s favor.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know that you had lost it.”\r\n\r\n“What? Have you not heard that when Nero--what a delightful buffoon he\r\nis, to be sure!--was singing on the stage at Corinth, my sire Vespasian\r\nwas so little appreciative of good music as actually to yawn, and even\r\nto fall asleep and snore, with the result that not only _Pater nocens_\r\nbut even _Filius innocens_ was forbidden to appear in the imperial\r\npresence.”\r\n\r\n“I marvel that you did not both lose your heads.”\r\n\r\n“So do I. Though banished, however, I did not lose heart, but in the\r\nspirit of a true courtier I sacrificed every day to Nero’s heavenly\r\nvoice; and, on learning this (for I took good care it should reach his\r\nears!), he recalled me to court, and marked his approval of my piety by\r\nsending me on a mission to Cæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“A mission? Of what nature?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you doubtless know that yon fair city of Cæsarea is peopled\r\nboth with Greeks and Jews, each claiming precedency of the other. Let\r\nprocurator Florus post up an edict beginning, ‘To the Greeks and Jews\r\nof Cæsarea,’ and the Jewish mob will tear it down. Let him word it, ‘To\r\nthe Jews and Greeks,’ and the Greeks will not suffer it to remain up.\r\nThe Greek high priest of Jupiter demands that on state occasions he\r\nshall sit upon the right hand of the procurator; the high priest of the\r\nJews, when he comes to Cæsarea, claims the same privilege. The Greeks\r\nwish their language to be used in the law-courts to the exclusion of\r\nour own stately Latin--there’s taste for you! the Jews clamor for their\r\nown tongue. This feud is productive of continual rioting and bloodshed.\r\nTherefore Nero, appealed to by deputies from both factions, hath\r\npronounced his decree, dispatching it from Greece by my hand.”\r\n\r\n“And in whose favor hath Cæsar decided?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I know not. The decree was contained in a sealed letter addressed\r\nto Florus, who hath not yet made it public. As for me, instead of\r\nhastening back to Nero to show him how quickly I can transact his\r\nbusiness, I, like a fool, tarry in the neighborhood of Cæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“There being a woman in the case,” smiled Crispus; “otherwise the\r\nusually sensible Titus would not be garbed like a fashionable dandy.\r\nWhat would your stern republican father say to this perfuming of\r\nyourself?”\r\n\r\n“A woman in the case? Say, rather, a goddess. No lovelier face hath\r\never been seen since Helen lured the Grecian ships to Troy.”\r\n\r\n“Fickle Titus! Last autumn he was vowing eternal fidelity to Lesbia,\r\nthe hetæra; it was the Greek dancing-girl Lycoris in winter; this\r\nspring it is--who?”\r\n\r\n“Lesbia and Lycoris! Pouf!” said Titus, as if blowing these nymphs away\r\nin air. “Do not mention them, I pray you, in the same breath with this\r\nsplendid eastern beauty. I am serious now, if ever I were so. I would\r\nmarry her to-morrow, were she willing; nay, more, to win her I would\r\neven repudiate the religion of my ancestors, and worship her Jewish\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n“Titus must indeed be smitten! So your fair one is a Jewess?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and in rank far above poor plebeian me,” said Titus, sighing like\r\na furnace.\r\n\r\n“You talk thus! you who are a quæstor, tribune of a legion, and a\r\nmessenger of imperial Cæsar?”\r\n\r\n“And the son of a man who was once a horse-doctor; forget not that.”\r\n\r\n“You were brought up in the imperial household with Britannicus,\r\nenjoying the same luxuries and the same instructors as he.”\r\n\r\n“And very nearly drinking of the same fatal cup,” commented Titus,\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n“The gods reserved you for a nobler destiny. But as to your fair\r\nlady--who is she?”\r\n\r\n“A princess, beautiful, proud, scornful. Berenice her name, the\r\ndaughter of that Agrippa who, some twenty years ago, was King of\r\nPalestine. He left her so much wealth that she is called ‘Golden\r\nBerenice.’ You know her?” added Titus, as he saw an odd look flit for a\r\nmoment over the face of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“I have seen her.”\r\n\r\n“Then you know how beautiful she is.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is certainly beautiful,” replied Crispus, in a tone as if\r\ngrudging the admission.\r\n\r\n“You speak coldly. ’Tis clear I shall never have _you_ for a rival.”\r\n\r\n“True, O Titus. When I mate it shall be with pure maid. Hath not your\r\nBerenice already had one husband?”\r\n\r\n“She was wedded, when quite a girl, to Polemo, King of Pontus, who\r\ndivorced her two years afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“Polemo?” ejaculated Crispus, in some surprise. “Polemo?--one of my\r\nfather’s friends. Why did he divorce her?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, ask that of others. He was elderly and serious; she was youthful\r\nand gay: _there_, I suspect, lay the reason.”\r\n\r\n“Their separation,” remarked Crispus, “does not appear to have left\r\nmuch bitterness behind, for, at a banquet given by my father to all\r\nthe kings of the East, Polemo and the Princess Berenice sat side by\r\nside, seeming to be on excellent terms with each other. And, what\r\nstruck me as strange, their glances were so often cast in my direction\r\nthat I could not help wondering whether I were the subject of their\r\ntalk. Were there any children born of this marriage?”\r\n\r\n“One--a daughter, said to have died in infancy.”\r\n\r\n“And you would woo this Herodian princess? Do you frequent this lonely\r\nshore in order to sigh out vows to Venus?” said Crispus, pointing to\r\nlove’s planet that sparkled like an eye in the blue depths above.\r\n\r\n“I come here hoping to have the pleasure of a few words with her as she\r\nreturns to Cæsarea. An hour ago, so I am told, she drove this way in\r\nher chariot.”\r\n\r\n“You do right, then, in retracing your steps, for I can certify that no\r\nchariot has passed me.”\r\n\r\n“Then she must have turned aside, and gone inland,” said Titus, looking\r\nto the left as if meditating a diversion among the hills in quest of\r\nthe fair princess.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh he resigned the project, and strode onward beside Crispus,\r\nwhose frequent questions on all that fell within the sphere of his\r\nvision showed that he was treading the shore of Palestine for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“How name you yon house?” he asked, pointing ahead to an edifice\r\nperched upon a crag that overlooked the shore road.\r\n\r\n“I am told that it is called ‘Beth-tamar.’”\r\n\r\n“And that, being interpreted, meaneth ‘The House of Palms,’” remarked\r\nCrispus, and smiling at Titus’ look of surprise. “O, I know something\r\nof the speech of these barbarians, having learned it in childhood from\r\none of my father’s favorite slaves, a captive Jew; and so long as the\r\nfellow kept to his language, well and good, but when he tried to make\r\nme a proselyte to his superstition, he was promptly scourged, and put\r\nat a distance from me.”\r\n\r\n“Hebrew!” commented Titus. “You have the better of me. Would that I\r\ncould speak it, for then it might dispose Berenice to look with a more\r\nfavorable eye upon me. As it is, I have to say with Ovid:\r\n\r\n    ‘_Barbarus hic ego sum, quia non intelligor ulli._’”\r\n\r\nWhat more he would have said was checked by a command delivered in an\r\nauthoritative voice:\r\n\r\n“Halt!”\r\n\r\nInstinctively the two friends paused, and glanced aloft. Standing upon\r\na lower spur of the crag above them, and clearly defined against the\r\nstar-lit sky, was a tall figure in a flowing robe.\r\n\r\n“Who are you that bid two Romans halt?” demanded Titus, haughtily.\r\n\r\n“The servant of a king,” was the answer, delivered in the Latin\r\nlanguage, though not with the true Latin accent.\r\n\r\n“Your master’s name?” asked Titus, suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Polemo, King of Pontus.”\r\n\r\nAt this Crispus and Titus looked at each other, deeming it odd to be\r\nbrought thus in connection with the monarch about whom they had just\r\nbeen talking.\r\n\r\n“I have a message,” continued the stranger, “for one, Crispus Cestius\r\nGallus.”\r\n\r\n“My name,” said the bearer of it. “What would the king with me?”\r\n\r\n“My royal master bids you tarry an hour with him ere journeying on to\r\nCæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the king to be found?”\r\n\r\n“Within the walls of his mansion, Beth-tamar.”\r\n\r\n“And should I pass on my way neglectful of the king’s bidding----?”\r\n\r\n“Pass on, and miss a high destiny.”\r\n\r\n“Haste thee, and tell thy lord that Crispus comes with his friend,\r\nTitus Flavius.”\r\n\r\nThe man had appeared suddenly; just as suddenly did he now disappear.\r\nBidding his two slaves await his return, Crispus turned from the\r\nmaritime road, and began to climb the rough ascent. His ready\r\nacquiescence with the stranger’s wish was viewed with some uneasiness\r\nby Titus, who was, however, quickly reassured by Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Polemo, in this matter,” said he, “acts as his own messenger, for it\r\nwas he who spoke with us.”\r\n\r\n“The king himself?” said Titus, greatly surprised.\r\n\r\n“Even so,” replied Crispus. “We can enter Beth-tamar in perfect safety.\r\nI am not altogether unprepared for this meeting. As I was setting out\r\nfrom Antioch my father spoke thus to me: ‘On your way to Cæsarea you\r\nmay meet with King Polemo, who hath a proposal for you. I leave you\r\nfree to accept or decline, but, if you will be guided by me, you will\r\ndo his bidding, however strange it may appear.’”\r\n\r\nLanguage such as this moved Titus to wonder, and he became almost as\r\neager as Crispus for the meeting with the Pontic king.\r\n\r\nArrived upon the platform that formed the summit of the crag, the two\r\nRomans saw before them a rectangular edifice, massive and spacious,\r\nformed like most of the buildings in that region from blocks of\r\nlimestone--a bare dull-looking structure; but then the Oriental house\r\nis not to be judged by its outside, for a costly exterior suggests\r\nwealth, and in the East, wealth, then, as now, is a temptation to the\r\npowers that be.\r\n\r\nWithin the arched entrance stood a slave, who, with a profound salaam,\r\ninvited the two friends to follow him. Traversing a stone passage,\r\nthey quickly emerged into a spacious court, open to the sky: rooms\r\nwith latticed windows looked out upon this court, and to one of these\r\nthe slave conducted the visitors, and there left them. The room was\r\nOriental in character: a cushioned divan ran round the marble walls\r\nthat gleamed with gilded arabesques and lapis-lazuli. In the middle of\r\nthe tesselated pavement was a fountain, whose waters played with a\r\ngolden sparkle in the soft radiance shed by the many lamps pendent from\r\nthe fretted roof above.\r\n\r\nAs the two Romans entered, there came forward to greet them the same\r\nman that had spoken from the crag, a man of grave and stately presence,\r\nwhose classic features can still be studied on the extant coins of\r\nthe kingdom of Pontus. He had cast off the coarse garb he had worn\r\nwithout, and appeared now in a majestic robe of royal purple. On his\r\nfinger glittered a gold ring, decorated with a cameo sculptured with a\r\nminiature head of Nero, a fact of some significance, since the wearing\r\nof such a ring was permitted to those only who had the high privilege\r\nof free access to the Emperor’s presence.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to Beth-tamar!” were the monarch’s first words. “Aware that\r\nyou were drawing near to Cæsarea,” he continued, addressing Crispus, “I\r\nhave ventured thus to intercept your journey.”\r\n\r\n“To what end?”\r\n\r\n“Hath not your father told you?”\r\n\r\nCrispus answered in the negative. Polemo seemed surprised at this;\r\nhe hesitated, and glanced at Titus as if his presence were an\r\nembarrassment. Divining his thoughts, Crispus spoke:\r\n\r\n“Titus is my _fidus Achates_. Let not the king take it amiss, but\r\nwhatever is said must be said before him.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said Polemo, after a brief pause. “You must, however, both\r\ngive pledge, that the proposal I am about to make, whether accepted or\r\ndeclined, shall be kept a secret till such time as I shall choose it to\r\nbe known.”\r\n\r\n“The character of the noble Polemo,” returned Crispus, “is a sufficient\r\nguarantee that he will require of me nothing dishonorable or nothing\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the Roman state.”\r\n\r\n“Far be such thoughts from me. My aim is to add to its strength.”\r\nAssured thus, both Crispus and Titus promised to hold sacred whatever\r\nthe king were minded to reveal.\r\n\r\n“Good! To come at once to the question, for I love not many words, you\r\nare doubtless aware of my misfortune in having no son to succeed me on\r\nthe throne. I am,” he added mournfully, “the last of my race. In these\r\ncircumstances our lord Nero has graciously conceded to me the favor of\r\nnominating a successor, with the necessary proviso that my choice must\r\nfall on a man loyal to the Empire. Such a one I have found.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at Crispus, whose head began suddenly to whirl\r\nwith a daring hope. Could it be that he himself was----?\r\n\r\n“If,” continued Polemo, “if loyalty to Rome be the first qualification\r\nin my successor, who more loyal than a Roman himself? who more likely\r\nto meet with the approval of the Senate than one of the Senatorial\r\norder? For these reasons, then, and because your past deeds have shown\r\nyou to be worthy of the dignity, I am minded at a date three years from\r\nnow to confer upon you the scepter of Pontus. What say you to this?”\r\n\r\nAt first Crispus could say nothing for very amazement. Then, recovering\r\nsomewhat, he began eagerly to question the king, and found him to all\r\nappearances sincere in making the offer.\r\n\r\nNow, although Polemo had made a special point of Crispus’ worthiness,\r\nCrispus himself had nevertheless a secret belief that the king was\r\nactuated by some ulterior motive. He recalled a saying of his father’s:\r\n“There is fire within Polemo for all his cold exterior. To me he seems\r\na man who, having received a great wrong, is meditating a scheme of\r\nrevenge--ay, and devoting his whole life to it. The weapon may take\r\nyears in the forging, but when forged it will fall, swiftly, terribly.”\r\nRecalling these words, Crispus began to wonder whether the offer just\r\nmade was a part of the king’s scheme of vengeance. Was he, Crispus,\r\nto be elevated to the throne merely to bring gall to some scheming and\r\nambitious enemy? Crispus had a reasonable objection to be utilized for\r\nsuch a purpose; but still, what mattered? Here was an opportunity of\r\ngaining a splendid dignity, and it would be foolish to let his scruples\r\nas to the other’s motive interfere with his ambition.\r\n\r\nA king!\r\n\r\n“All things,” said Porus, “are comprehended in that word.”\r\n\r\nWhat fancies crowded thick and fast upon Crispus’ mind as he tried to\r\npicture the future!\r\n\r\nHe would be a father to his people; would regulate their finances;\r\nfoster their commerce; increase the army; promote the use of the Latin\r\nlanguage and encourage Greek culture. In the glens of the Caucasus,\r\nbordering upon his kingdom, were wild tribes that had never yet\r\nacknowledged a conqueror. He would curb their predatory incursions, and\r\naugment his territory at their expense. Nay, he might even pass that\r\nmighty mountain-barrier, and carry his arms over Scythia, a region that\r\nhad defied the attempts of the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman.\r\nWhy should he not be in the North what Alexander had been in the East,\r\nand Cæsar in the West? Then, when his kingdom had become enlarged and\r\nLatinized, he would act the patriot, and transfer his dominion to the\r\nSenate, making it a province of mighty Rome.\r\n\r\nDreams, perhaps, but it is in such dreams that empires have sometimes\r\nhad their beginning.\r\n\r\n“What answer do you make?”\r\n\r\n“At present, none,” replied the cautious Crispus. “Is your gift\r\naccompanied by any stipulation?”\r\n\r\n“One only. He who chooses the king of Pontus must also choose its\r\nqueen.”\r\n\r\n“In other words, I must take a wife, a wife to be chosen by you.”\r\n\r\n“That is so.”\r\n\r\n“And failing to do this--no scepter?”\r\n\r\n“Truly said. The gift of the kingdom is dependent upon your marrying\r\nthe lady of my choice. The two go together.”\r\n\r\n“And what date do you fix for our nuptials?”\r\n\r\n“This very night--nay, this very hour.”\r\n\r\n“_To-night?_ Ye gods! You hear that, Titus?”\r\n\r\n“The lady is at hand, for in the reasonable belief that you would not\r\nrefuse a throne I have had her brought here.”\r\n\r\n“Her name?”\r\n\r\n“Call her Athenaïs, since that is the name she will take as queen.”\r\n\r\n“I am not to know her real name! What is her rank?”\r\n\r\n“Superior to your own, for she is of royal blood.”\r\n\r\n“She is of fair shape, I trust?”\r\n\r\n“Zeuxis never delineated a face and form more lovely.”\r\n\r\nThese words served to whet Crispus’ curiosity. He expressed a wish to\r\nsee his prospective bride.\r\n\r\n“See her you will not; she will be veiled during the ceremony. Nor will\r\nyou hear her voice, for she will not speak. When the rite is over you\r\nwill resume your journey to Cæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“Without seeing the face of my wife!” gasped Crispus in amazement. Was\r\nthere ever so strange a marriage proposal?\r\n\r\n“It is my will that you shall not know whom you have married. The lady\r\nis beautiful, high-born, and brings a crown as a dowry. Is not that\r\nenough?”\r\n\r\n“And when will my bride be made known to me?”\r\n\r\n“On the day when you assume the scepter.”\r\n\r\n“And the date of that event?”\r\n\r\n“As I have said, at the end of three years.”\r\n\r\n“The word of Polemo is his bond,” said Crispus, “but seeing\r\nthat--_absit omen!_--you may be dead ere the three years be past, what\r\nwarranty shall I then have of the due execution of this, your promise?”\r\n\r\n“This,” replied the king, producing a parchment-scroll and unrolling\r\nit. “’Tis yours as soon as the nuptial ceremony be over.”\r\n\r\nCrispus ran his eye over the scroll, and saw that it was what\r\nRoman lawyers would call an _instrumentum_--in other words, a\r\nlegally-executed document, constituting him the heir of Polemo in the\r\nsovereignty of Pontus. It was subscribed with the signature of the\r\nking, and, what was of far more weight, with that of Nero himself.\r\n\r\n“Do you assent?”\r\n\r\n“I assent.”\r\n\r\n“Consider well; remember that you are to pledge yourself to remain\r\nfaithful to Athenaïs, who in turn pledges herself to remain faithful\r\nto you. Should you in this interval be found breaking your vow by\r\noffering love to any woman--yea, even though it be to your own unknown\r\nwife”--Crispus smiled at the supposition--“you lose the crown of\r\nPontus.”\r\n\r\n“Your terms are strange, but I abide by them.”\r\n\r\n“You are ready to wed?”\r\n\r\n“This very hour.”\r\n\r\n“You promise not to lift her veil? You are content not to hear her\r\nvoice? You are willing to depart as soon as the rite is over? You\r\npromise with your friend to observe secrecy as touching this night’s\r\nwork?”\r\n\r\nThere was a light as of triumph in Polemo’s eyes when the two Romans\r\ngave assent to these terms. It confirmed Crispus in his belief that the\r\nking was using him as an instrument of vengeance. But, as before, he\r\nsaid within himself, “What matters?”\r\n\r\n“With what rites do we wed?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“With the words customary in your own Roman nuptial ceremonies,\r\nconfirming them by placing this token upon the finger of the bride,”\r\nreturned Polemo.\r\n\r\nHe handed to Crispus a gold ring. It was set with a ruby, upon whose\r\nsurface there was graven, with beautiful and marvelous art, a device\r\nthat caused a quick look of surprise to pass over the face of Crispus.\r\nAs he slowly and mechanically turned the ring over in his hand the\r\nruby darted forth sparkles that caused what was sculptured on the gem\r\nto vanish as if in a blaze of fire. At that sight Crispus gave a great\r\nstart, and darted an inquiring look at the king, who replied by a smile\r\nfull of a hidden meaning. Titus, who took due note of all this, was\r\nnaturally not a little puzzled; he refrained from comment, however,\r\nbelieving that Crispus would enlighten him later.\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” said Polemo, and, lifting a curtain, he led the way to\r\nanother chamber so dimly illumined by one lamp only that the parts\r\nremote from the light were scarcely discernible, an arrangement\r\nobviously due to Polemo’s determination that Crispus should see as\r\nlittle as possible of his bride.\r\n\r\nIn the semi-darkness two waiting figures, both deeply veiled, were\r\nfaintly visible.\r\n\r\nOf the one that stood a little in the rear Crispus took no note, she\r\nbeing obviously an attendant. It was the other upon whom his eyes were\r\nset. Slender and of medium stature, she wore the usual dress of a Roman\r\nbride, the _tunica recta_, a long white robe with a purple fringe,\r\nand girt at the waist with a zone. The _flammeum_, or veil, which\r\neffectually concealed her features, was bright yellow in color, as were\r\nlikewise her dainty little shoes. The bride’s hair with the point of\r\na spear, was dispensed with on this occasion, her head being covered\r\nwith a coif, so well disposed that not a single tress was visible. So\r\ncompletely was her person hidden that, let her dress be changed, and\r\nthere was nothing by which he could identify her, if he should meet her\r\nagain that same night.\r\n\r\nThough Crispus could not see her eyes, he knew full well that she was\r\nwatching him as keenly as he was watching her, a scrutiny in which the\r\nadvantage was all on her side. She stood, wordless and motionless,\r\nevidently awaiting the king’s pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Athenaïs,” said he, “this is your husband.”\r\n\r\nShe made a little obeisance to Crispus, a simple act, yet performed\r\nwith a grace that charmed him.\r\n\r\nHe did not know in what relation Polemo stood to the bride, but his way\r\nof speaking implied a quasi-authority over her, and since it was the\r\nfashion in those days for parents and guardians to arrange marriages\r\nwith very little regard for the feelings of the two most concerned in\r\nthe affair, Crispus could not help wondering whether pressure had been\r\nput upon this Athenaïs to induce her to consent to the union. He would\r\nfind out.\r\n\r\n“Lady,” he said, “I am willing to marry, but only on the understanding\r\nthat you come to me without compulsion. Therefore, if you take me\r\nof your own free will, testify the same--since you are forbidden to\r\nspeak--by coming forward two paces.”\r\n\r\nAthenaïs hesitated, but only for a second. Giving him what he felt to\r\nbe a grateful glance, she advanced two steps.\r\n\r\n“A mutual agreement,” smiled Polemo. “This is as it should be.”\r\n\r\nHe whispered in the ear of the bride something that Crispus could not\r\ncatch. Whatever it was it evoked from her a little ripple of laughter,\r\nso sweet and silvery, that Crispus was put into sympathy with her at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“If her face be as witching as her laughter!” thought he.\r\n\r\nBut her laugh, however charming to Crispus, had a very different effect\r\nupon Titus. An attentive spectator would have seen him start violently,\r\nand turn pale. He seemed on the point of breaking out into words, but\r\nchecking himself, he stood mute, his whole attitude expressive of\r\ndejection, a feeling that seemed to increase as the nuptial ceremony\r\nproceeded. Crispus, occupied with the matter in hand, did not notice\r\nhis friend’s agitation.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Polemo Crispus drew near to Athenaïs, Titus acting\r\nas paranymph, or, to use the modern phrase, “best man,” the veiled\r\nattendant performing a similar office for the bride.\r\n\r\nAthenaïs, directed by the king, put forth a white and prettily-shaped\r\nhand, which Crispus took in his own.\r\n\r\nIf her feelings bore any resemblance to those of Crispus she must have\r\nfelt like one in a dream, for he could scarcely believe the scene to be\r\nreal. An hour ago he would have laughed had anyone prophesied for him\r\nan early marriage, and yet here he was on the point of marrying a woman\r\nof whose past history he knew nothing, a woman from whom, as soon as\r\nthe ceremony was over, he must part, without seeing her face, without\r\nreceiving so little as one word from her, part for a space of time to\r\nbe measured, not by months, but by years! What would his friends at\r\nRome think of a marriage contracted under auspices so strange? “Weddeth\r\nCrispus as a fool weddeth?” would surely be their comment.\r\n\r\nThus much, however, could be said for his act: it had his father’s\r\nsanction, and with this thought Crispus tried to suppress all\r\nmisgivings.\r\n\r\nMechanically he found himself repeating after Polemo the final words of\r\nthe rite that was to unite him for life with the unknown Athenaïs.\r\n\r\n“Leaving all other, and keeping only to thee, I, Crispus Cestius\r\nGallus, patrician of Rome, do take thee, Athenaïs, to be my lawful\r\nwife, to be openly acknowledged as such when it shall please thee to\r\nclaim me by this token.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he slid upon her slender finger the golden ring given him by\r\nPolemo.\r\n\r\nNo sound came from the woman who was now his wife, but her agitation\r\nwas shown by her trembling hand, by her accelerated breathing, by her\r\nattitude, half-reclining, in the arms of her attendant.\r\n\r\nHer hand seemed to close voluntarily upon his own. The thrilling\r\npressure of those fair fingers imparted to him somehow the belief that,\r\noriginally reluctant to come to the ceremony, she now viewed it with\r\npleasure, a thought that gave him pleasure in turn.\r\n\r\nThe sweet laugh that had come from her, the clasp of her pretty hand,\r\nher willingness to trust her whole future to his keeping, so moved\r\nCrispus that he began to feel a keen regret that he must immediately\r\npart from her. He became almost angry with himself for having submitted\r\nto the hard terms prescribed by Polemo.\r\n\r\nAs he released her hand she sank back half-swooning in the arms of the\r\nother woman, who, at a sign from Polemo, proceeded to draw her gently\r\nfrom the apartment. Till the last Crispus kept his eyes upon her,\r\nhoping that, in spite of Polemo, she might raise a corner of her veil,\r\nand give him just one glimpse at least of her face.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be, however. She melted away into the shadows around, and\r\nhe saw her no more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two Romans walked again by the star-lit shore with Beth-tamar far\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n“What,” asked Titus, who, since the wedding ceremony, had been\r\nstrangely silent, “what was engraved on the stone of the nuptial ring\r\nthat you should start so?”\r\n\r\nHe received little enlightenment from the reply of Crispus:\r\n\r\n“_The image of a temple in flames!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         THE BANQUET OF FLORUS\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning after his arrival at Cæsarea, Crispus was waited\r\nupon at his lodgings by Gessius Florus, procurator of Judæa, who,\r\napprised of Crispus’ coming, lost no time in calling upon the son of\r\nthe Syrian Legate, that Legate whose word was all-powerful in the East.\r\n\r\nPrevious knowledge had disposed Crispus to take an unfavorable opinion\r\nof Florus, an opinion that became strengthened on seeing the man\r\nhimself. A shallow-minded Greek of Clazomenæ, and no true Roman, he\r\nhad gained the procuratorship of Judæa, not through merit, but by the\r\ninfluence of his wife Cleopatra, who was a close friend of the reigning\r\nEmpress Poppæa.\r\n\r\nFlorus, though born in Ionia, had little of the grace that is usually\r\nassociated with that region, and had Crispus not known otherwise he\r\nmight have taken the governor, with his round bullet head, furtive\r\ngreenish-brown eyes, and heavy brutal jaw, for a member of that\r\npugilistic fraternity whose feats with the cæstus were the delight of\r\nthe lower orders among the Romans.\r\n\r\nHe was desirous that Crispus should form one at a grand banquet, to be\r\nheld that night in the Prætorium, or procuratorial palace.\r\n\r\nCrispus was about to decline the honor, when he thought of Athenaïs.\r\nFor all he knew to the contrary she might be a resident of Cæsarea, and\r\nif so, her “royal blood” would certainly entitle her to an invitation.\r\nShe might be among the guests. He would go, though it would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to recognize her.\r\n\r\nFlorus withdrew in apparent delight.\r\n\r\nAs for Titus, he departed that same day for Rome, embarking on the good\r\nship _Stella_.\r\n\r\n“There is no hope of my ever winning Berenice,” he said, though\r\nwithout assigning any reason for coming so suddenly to this lugubrious\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure, however, he did Crispus a good service by\r\nintroducing him to a brave and worthy Roman, Terentius Rufus by name.\r\nHe was the captain of the garrison stationed at Jerusalem, and had come\r\nwith his cohort to Cæsarea to aid in the work of suppressing the riots\r\nthat were almost certain to arise upon the coming publication of Nero’s\r\nedict relative to the precedency claimed by the Jews and the Greeks.\r\n\r\nTerentius Rufus, like Crispus, had received an invitation to the\r\nbanquet of Florus, and so, at the appointed time, the two presented\r\nthemselves at the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nUpon making their way to the hall appropriated to the feast, a hall\r\ncalled Neronium after the reigning emperor, they paused a moment at\r\nthe entrance to contemplate the sight. The marble saloon, supported by\r\nporphyry columns and blazing with the radiance of a thousand lamps, was\r\na scene of glitter, movement, and color. Sweet spices burned in gilded\r\ntripods; the rarest flowers glowed from sculptured vases; the ivory\r\ntriclinia with their purple cushions, the lavish display of gold and\r\nsilver plate, the rich dresses and jewels of the ladies, made a picture\r\ndestined to live long in the memory of Crispus.\r\n\r\nHe marveled to see such splendor in the hall of a provincial governor.\r\n\r\n“Whence does Florus obtain the wealth that enables him to make such a\r\ndisplay?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“There are others who would like an answer to that question,” replied\r\nRufus, mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“Where _is_ Florus?” asked Crispus, glancing around, and not seeing the\r\nprocurator.\r\n\r\n“Probably tickling his throat with a feather to produce a vomit,”\r\nanswered Rufus, referring to the disgusting custom practiced by many\r\nRomans of that age for the purpose of creating an appetite. “You may\r\ntrust him to do full justice to the banquet.”\r\n\r\nCrispus was not slow to recognize among the guests that type of\r\nphysiognomy which, graved on Egyptian monuments long ere Rome was\r\nfounded, has continued almost unchanged to the present day.\r\n\r\n“There are many Jews here to-night,” remarked he.\r\n\r\n“And Jewesses, too,” replied Rufus; “and here comes the fairest of them\r\nall, leaning upon the arm of Florus. For a wonder he’s sober!”\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden cessation of tongues as a curtain that draped a\r\ncertain archway was lifted by two bowing slaves to give entrance to the\r\nprocurator.\r\n\r\nGlancing around, Florus immediately caught sight of Crispus, and\r\nadvanced to give him welcome. He was accompanied by a lady, none other\r\nthan the Princess Berenice, and as Crispus quietly surveyed her, he\r\nthought it no wonder that Titus should have fallen in love with her at\r\nfirst sight. She had dark hair and dark starry eyes, and a face which,\r\nwhen radiant with a smile as it was at that moment, was perfectly\r\ndazzling in its loveliness. Her figure, which was as beautiful as her\r\nface, was appareled in a robe of purple silk, embroidered with flowers\r\nof gold and adorned with the costliest pearls.\r\n\r\nShe greeted Crispus with a sweet smile of recognition.\r\n\r\n“Do not neglect me to-night as you did at Antioch,” she said\r\nhalf-jestingly, and then giving him a witching glance she passed on,\r\nwith Florus, to her place at the banquet. While the procurator reclined\r\nat full length upon the triclinium, Berenice sat erect beside him, for\r\nthe posture assumed by men at the banquet was deemed unbecoming in\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nCrispus and Rufus had places assigned them at the triclinium adjoining\r\nthat of Florus, and upon the same couch with them reclined a\r\nshrewd-looking, keen-eyed man, who, so Rufus informed Crispus, went by\r\nthe name of Tertullus, and was a distinguished forensic orator.\r\n\r\n“Mark well his noble name,” said Rufus, laughingly. “Tertullus,\r\nthrice-Tully! What could be more suitable for an orator? Take my\r\nadvice, Crispus,” continued he, “if you have a lawsuit while at\r\nCæsarea, fail not to employ my friend Tertullus, who never undertook a\r\ncase he did not win.”\r\n\r\n“Save once,” corrected Tertullus. “Paul of Tarsus escaped the stoning\r\nwe had marked out for him.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I am forgetting him. The dog, it seems, is a Roman citizen. He\r\nappealed to Nero, who let him off.”\r\n\r\n“And what was the result?” commented Tertullus. “A few months later\r\nRome was in flames, lit by the hands of his disciples. The wretches!\r\nHaters of mankind! I know of only one class of men more vile than they,\r\nand that is the sect of the Zealots, whose latest victim I am.”\r\n\r\n“How mean you?” asked Rufus.\r\n\r\n“Have you not heard? No? Well, a few days ago I was journeying from\r\nJericho to the Jewish capital. Knowing the state of the country, I\r\ntraveled in the company of an armed caravan that was going the same\r\nway. We took a long circuit northwards to avoid the dreaded Pass of\r\nAdummim; all to no purpose. Manahem and his Zealots, like vultures\r\nscenting their quarry afar, swooped down upon us. I was one of the few\r\nthat escaped. When is Florus going to dispatch an expedition against\r\nthat robber crew?”\r\n\r\n“Did you lose aught?”\r\n\r\n“Some gold plate, and--what I treasured above all earthly things--a\r\nmyrrhine vase, so precious that I weep when I think of it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t think of it, then,” said Rufus. “Turn to a more pleasant theme,\r\nthe Princess Berenice. She looks more charming and more youthful than\r\never to-night. Now, how old should you take her to be?” he continued,\r\naddressing Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Not much past twenty,” he hazarded.\r\n\r\nRufus laughed pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“Why, ’tis sixteen years ago since she married Polemo. She cannot be a\r\nday younger than thirty-eight.”\r\n\r\nCrispus was surprised to hear it.\r\n\r\n“There is many a young girl here to-night,” said he, “who looks older\r\nthan the princess.”\r\n\r\n“Berenice takes extreme pains to preserve her beauty,” remarked Rufus.\r\n“’Tis said that, like Poppæa, she bathes daily in asses’ milk to render\r\nher skin soft and supple.”\r\n\r\nFlorus now gave the signal for the feast, and there entered a train of\r\npretty Greek maidens with baskets containing wreaths of flowers, for to\r\ndine ungarlanded would have been a departure from fashionable usage.\r\nBerenice chose a wreath of violets; Florus made a similar selection.\r\n\r\n“The flower honored by a princess must be _my_ choice, too,” he\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nThis little by-play did not pass unnoticed by Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Florus is madly in love with her,” commented Rufus. “For the matter of\r\nthat, who isn’t?”\r\n\r\n“I thought that Florus already had a wife,” said Crispus.\r\n\r\n“That’s no obstacle in these lax days, when a man takes a new wife\r\nwith each year. It is whispered that Florus contemplates divorcing\r\nCleopatra.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Cleopatra at this present time?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“In Rome,” answered Tertullus, as he fixed a garland of roses upon\r\nhis head, “looking after her precious husband’s interests. He takes\r\nadvantage of her absence to pay court to Berenice, who cares not a whit\r\nfor him, and intends no hurt to Cleopatra. Berenice is not to be too\r\nhastily condemned,” he continued, observing Crispus’ frown. “Her action\r\nin this matter, as in all others, is guided by two motives--love of\r\nher people, and love of her own superstition. Now, Florus, in the\r\nexercise of his procuratorship, can, if he be so minded, inflict\r\ninjuries upon the Jewish people, and can also, though to a limited\r\nextent, interfere with the administration of their public worship.\r\n‘But,’ argues our fair Berenice, ‘he is not likely to adopt these\r\ncourses while seeking to win _me_, who am a Jewess. Therefore, for the\r\ngood of the Jews I will amuse him with hopes.’ Now after this long\r\nspeech,” added Tertullus, “let me eat. I can see the lampreys coming,\r\nand they are my favorite dish.”\r\n\r\nAnd the delicacy being set before him, Tertullus applied himself\r\nthereto. After a time he raised his voice and addressed the procurator.\r\n\r\n“I have myself, O Florus, given great attention to the breeding of\r\nlampreys, but I confess that I can never get them to attain the\r\ndelicate flavor of those bred by you.”\r\n\r\nTwo or three other guests made similar remarks.\r\n\r\nFlorus smiled with the air of a man who, having discovered an excellent\r\nthing, is determined to keep it to himself.\r\n\r\n“Now, it is precisely because I happen to know _how_ the delicate\r\nflavor is acquired,” whispered Rufus, “that I avoid partaking of that\r\ndish.”\r\n\r\n“By the trident of Neptune,” said Tertullus, “I wish you would\r\ncommunicate the secret to me, for I am mightily fond of lampreys.”\r\n\r\n“Well, keep it a secret, for Florus may not thank me for telling it.\r\nWhenever one of his slaves commits a fault worthy of death, the poor\r\nwretch, instead of being hanged, is flung into the piscina to feed the\r\nlampreys. By the gods, I do not jest,” he added, as he noted Tertullus’\r\nlook of incredulity. “Get his chief piscinarius into a corner, put a\r\ndagger to his throat, and he’ll confess that what I say is true.”\r\n\r\nAs the Roman law gave to a master the power of life and death over\r\nhis slaves, Florus’ peculiar practice did not evoke from Crispus the\r\nabhorrence that the man of the twentieth century would express at such\r\na deed. As for Tertullus, he even went so far as to intimate that he\r\nmight adopt the practice himself.\r\n\r\n“If a slave _must_ die,” argued he, “let him die in a way that will add\r\nto his master’s enjoyment.”\r\n\r\nCrispus sought to change the subject of conversation by asking Rufus\r\nthe name of the richly-clothed man who reclined on the left of Florus;\r\nhe was a majestic-looking, dark-skinned personage, with hair and beard\r\nfinely dressed. At the beginning of the feast he had drawn forth\r\na little ivory casket, from which he had produced an asp that had\r\nimmediately twined itself around his bare arm, and there it remained\r\npartaking occasionally of such morsels as its master chose to give.\r\n\r\n“That,” replied Tertullus, “is Theomantes, the priest of Zeus Cæsarius,\r\nand a skilled diviner.”\r\n\r\n“And the serpent he carries with him, if you are fool enough to believe\r\nit,” remarked Rufus, “is an incarnation of the great Zeus himself. You\r\ncan see by the place assigned to Theomantes how highly he is esteemed.\r\nEvery Roman governor nowadays must have a soothsayer in attendance upon\r\nhim, and Florus would not be out of the fashion. It is this Theomantes\r\nwho supplies our procurator with the liquid for his daily bath.”\r\n\r\n“The liquid? What liquid?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not water, which is good enough for common mortals like you\r\nand me, nor yet milk, which the fair Berenice finds so excellent a\r\ncosmetic. Florus’ taste runs in favor of blood.”\r\n\r\n“_Blood!_” ejaculated Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Even so. Do you not know that by some physicians blood is deemed\r\nvery efficacious in strengthening the human frame when exhausted by\r\ndebauchery? So our dear governor bathes daily in a sanguinary fluid\r\ndrawn from the veins of oxen slain in sacrifice, his superstitious\r\nfancy disposing him to believe that there will be more virtue in blood\r\nof that sort. Oh, it’s not an uncommon practice, I assure you. We’ve\r\neven drawn from the Greek a name for it, calling it taurobolium.”\r\n\r\n“Every man to his taste,” commented Crispus, dryly; and continuing his\r\ninquiries as to the guests, he asked, “Who is that fierce graybeard\r\nreclining next to Theomantes?”\r\n\r\n“Ananias, son of Nebedeus, at one time high priest of the Jews,”\r\nreplied Rufus.\r\n\r\n“And a cheating knave!” commented Tertullus. “In his prosecution of\r\nPaul of Tarsus before Felix he employed me as advocate, and hath never\r\nyet paid me my fee. But I’ll be even with him.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mark,” continued Rufus, “how, from time to time, Ananias\r\nglowers at Theomantes? He considers that he himself should be sitting\r\nnext the governor.”\r\n\r\n“He is welcome to the place for me,” laughed Crispus. “And who is the\r\nfair damsel beside him? His daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Daughter me no daughter, forsooth!” returned Rufus. “That is Asenath,\r\na Syrian dancing-girl, and his latest favorite.”\r\n\r\n“I must reluctantly confess he hath a pretty taste,” said Tertullus;\r\n“she is a delicious armful.”\r\n\r\n“And she is desirous, you see, that we should observe the fact,”\r\nremarked Rufus.\r\n\r\nThe girl in question was a lovely brunette, attired in a Coan robe\r\nwhich, even in that decadent age, was deemed a trifle too extreme,\r\nconsisting as it did of silk so transparent in texture that the shapely\r\nlimbs of the wearer could be seen as through colored glass.\r\n\r\nAnd, be it observed, she was not the only female at the banquet thus\r\ndiaphanously clad!\r\n\r\n“That’s the girl,” continued Rufus, “to please whom he burnt in his\r\nown house the incense that it is not lawful to burn anywhere save upon\r\nthe altar of the Jewish temple. And as she was once curious to view\r\nthe Jewish worship, Ananias had the way from his house to the temple\r\ncarpeted for her pretty feet, and canopied to shield her from the sun.\r\nAnd he himself was so fastidiously minded that he was accustomed to\r\nwear silk gloves at the altar to avoid soiling his dainty fingers with\r\nthe blood of the sacrifices,[1] though why a Sadducee, such as he,\r\nshould want to worship God at all is a mystery to me. In the opinion of\r\nAnanias man dies as a dog dies. It seems to me that a God who creates\r\nman from dust merely to turn him into dust again is scarcely deserving\r\nof worship. What say you?”\r\n\r\n“Old Homer could have taught him better doctrine than that,” returned\r\nCrispus.\r\n\r\nThe conversation, it will be seen, was taking a theological turn;\r\nsomething of like sort was happening at the adjoining triclinium of\r\nFlorus.\r\n\r\n“I hate these Christians as much as you do,” remarked the procurator to\r\nBerenice. “But Nero hath taught us how to deal with them. And you say\r\nthere are still some of this sect at Jerusalem? I had thought that my\r\npredecessor Albinus, in slaying James, the brother of this Christus,\r\nhad put an end to these fanatics. You shall have your way, princess.\r\nWithin a week of my coming to Jerusalem there shall not be a Christian\r\nleft alive.”\r\n\r\n“Now the gods confound these Christians!” said Tertullus aloud. “They\r\ngrow daily wilder and madder in their blasphemies. They have now the\r\neffrontery to affirm that this Christus of theirs, who died in the\r\neighteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar, was something more than a man, that\r\nthis Galilæan peasant was in very truth a manifestation of the supreme\r\ndeity, the creator of the universe, and the great TO PAN spoken of by\r\nthe divine Plato.”\r\n\r\nAt these words there was on the part of Crispus a start as of surprise.\r\n\r\n“When do you say this Christus died?” he asked somewhat quickly.\r\n\r\n“In the eighteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar,” replied Tertullus.\r\n\r\n“In what month?”\r\n\r\n“On the fourteenth of Nisan, according to the Jewish calendar.”\r\n\r\n“Which in our style would be the seventh of April,” explained Rufus,\r\nafter a rapid mental calculation.\r\n\r\nCrispus’ surprise seemed to deepen.\r\n\r\n“And you say the Christians call their founder TO PAN? Strange!” he\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n“Why so?” asked Florus.\r\n\r\n“I could tell a curious story of that month and year. But there! let it\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“No, we must _not_ let it pass,” cried Florus, and thinking to do honor\r\nto Crispus, he said to those within his immediate vicinity, “Silence,\r\nfriends, for the noble Crispus’ story.”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were bent upon Crispus, who hesitated for a moment, and then,\r\nseeing expectancy written upon the faces of the guests, he began:\r\n\r\n“Well, since you will have it: At the time just mentioned, namely the\r\nmonth of April in the eighteenth year of Tiberius, there chanced to be\r\nupon the Ionian Sea a merchant vessel bound for Italy. It was eventide;\r\nthe breeze had died away, and the ship lay becalmed off the Isle of\r\nPaxos. Suddenly the stillness that lay upon land and sea was broken\r\nby a voice coming from the lonely shore--a voice clear and solemn,\r\nand one that carried awe to all who heard it, for it seemed scarcely\r\nto belong to earth. ‘_Thamus!_’ it cried. Now the pilot of the vessel\r\nhappened to be one Thamus, an Egyptian, a man of humble and obscure\r\norigin, and not so much as known by name to those on board. Full of\r\nfear, he let himself be called twice ere he would answer. At the third\r\ncry he found courage to ask, ‘What want you?’ And thus did the voice\r\nmake reply: ‘When thou comest to Pelodes, cry aloud that the great\r\nPan is dead.’ That was all; no more. The passengers, amazed and awed\r\nby the event, debated among themselves whether it would be wise to\r\nobey the mysterious voice. Thamus, himself, determined the matter: if\r\non attaining the appointed place there should be wind enough to fill\r\nthe sails, he would pass by in silence, but if not, he would proclaim\r\nthe message. The breeze freshened, the ship glided on, but when they\r\nreached Pelodes it made no further progress, for the wind suddenly\r\ndropped again. Thamus, therefore, taking his stand upon the prow,\r\nturned his face to the land, and shouted in a loud tone, ‘_Great Pan is\r\ndead!_’ Then from the hitherto silent shore there arose a sound like\r\nthe voice of a multitude, a sound as of weeping and wild lament.”[2]\r\n\r\nSuch was the story told by Crispus, and he finished with the odd\r\nfeeling that the telling of it had pleased neither the Jewish nor the\r\nGentile portion of his auditors.\r\n\r\n“Whence do you derive this story?” asked Theomantes with a somewhat\r\nsupercilious air.\r\n\r\n“From my father, himself a passenger in this same vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Who were they that made these sounds?”\r\n\r\n“Beings more than mortal; of that he is convinced.”\r\n\r\n“Gods and demons?”\r\n\r\n“It may be so.”\r\n\r\n“In a lamenting mood?”\r\n\r\n“A wailing as of despair, so my father describes the sound.”\r\n\r\n“Gods in despair at the death of someone? And this happened in Greece\r\nin the eighteenth year of Tiberius? Would you have us believe that the\r\nChristus crucified by Pilate and the ‘Great Pan’ of your story are one\r\nand the same, and that his death has caused the downfall of the gods?”\r\n\r\n“I am hardly likely to adopt that explanation, believing as I do in the\r\neternity of those gods by whose worship Rome has grown so great. The\r\nstory is true, let the meaning be what it may,” added Crispus in a tone\r\nwhose sharpness deterred Theomantes from making any further comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE QUEEN OF BEAUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, while telling his story, Crispus had become suddenly alive to the\r\npresence of a very beautiful girl sitting at an adjoining triclinium.\r\nIt was not so much her beauty, however, that attracted him as the\r\nattention she had paid to his words. She was by far the keenest and\r\nmost attentive of his listeners, seeming to hang breathless upon his\r\nlips during the whole recital; of all the assembly, she seemed to be\r\nthe only person to receive the story with pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Rufus,” whispered he, “who is that girl with the lovely golden\r\ntresses? To the left of us--on the next triclinium?”\r\n\r\nRufus turned in leisurely fashion to survey the maid in question.\r\n\r\n“I know not her name, or who she is. She came hither accompanied by him\r\nwho reclines beside her. As I see no likeness betwixt the two, I take\r\nit he is not her father.”\r\n\r\nThe man referred to was evidently a Hebrew, and distinguished both by\r\nhis noble features and rich attire.\r\n\r\n“Her father? Not he!” said Tertullus. “That is Josephus, a Jew, and yon\r\ndamsel, I’ll swear, is no Jewess. There is a grace and beauty about her\r\nthat is quite Ionic.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this Josephus?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“He is a priest of the first of the twenty-four courses,” replied\r\nTertullus, “and a rabbi so wondrously wise from his cradle upwards\r\nthat when he was only fourteen, aged priests and venerable sanhedrists\r\nwould consult him on points of the law too hard for their own\r\nunderstanding.”\r\n\r\n“What’s your authority for that story?” said Rufus dryly.\r\n\r\n“The best authority--his own.[3] He hath told me so many a time. At\r\nthe mature age of seventeen he had exhausted the whole course of\r\nphilosophy, and had decided that Pharisaism is the road to heaven.\r\nBut though a Pharisee, he cultivates Grecian literature, has literary\r\naspirations, and is said to be writing at the present time a treatise\r\nthat shall prove us Greeks and Romans to be in the matter of antiquity\r\nmere children of yesterday when compared with the Jews.”\r\n\r\nJosephus did not much interest Crispus, but the young girl did, and he\r\ncontinued to watch her. This was probably her first experience of a\r\nGentile banquet, and she seemed ill at ease amid her new surroundings.\r\nAnd no wonder! If the naked statuary and voluptuous paintings to\r\nbe seen around, the immodest Coan robes worn by the women, and the\r\nshameless license of their language were distasteful even to the pagan\r\nCrispus, how much more so to a young maiden trained in the pure and\r\nlofty principles of Judaism? Berenice, alas! reared in the atmosphere\r\nof a decadent court, could learn in the Prætorium of Florus little that\r\nwas new in the shape of wickedness, but the case was far different with\r\na young and innocent girl.\r\n\r\n“If this Josephus be her guardian, he is not exercising much\r\ndiscretion,” thought Crispus. “The banquet-hall of Florus is not the\r\nplace to bring a young girl to.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Ananias, the ex-high pontiff of the Jews, and Theomantes,\r\nthe priest of Zeus Cæsarius, created a diversion.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” muttered Rufus, “I knew that they’d be quarreling ere long.”\r\n\r\nThe two representatives of antagonistic religions were holding an\r\nanimated dispute; as the controversy waxed hotter their voices rose\r\nproportionately, till at last they attracted general attention.\r\nEveryone else in the assembly left off talking to listen to the\r\ndisputants.\r\n\r\n“Mercury a thief?” cried Theomantes. “So be it, then! And is it not\r\nwritten in your foolish scriptures that while Adam slept God stole from\r\nhis side a rib which He fashioned into the first woman? What else,\r\nthen, is _your_ God but a thief?”\r\n\r\nAnanias’ reply was anticipated by the Princess Berenice, ever quick to\r\ndefend her ancestral religion.\r\n\r\n“I will answer you,” said she to Theomantes. “Last night some thieves\r\nbroke into my house, and stole a silver vase.” She paused for a moment,\r\nthen added, “But they left a golden one in its stead.”\r\n\r\nThe Jewish guests greeted Berenice’s little parable with loud applause.\r\n\r\n“Jupiter!” laughed Florus, “I wish such thieves would come every night.”\r\n\r\nTheomantes returned to the attack. Holding his serpent close to the\r\nface of Ananias, and causing the reptile to give a hiss that made the\r\nHebrew priest start, he laughed and said:\r\n\r\n“My God is greater than yours.”\r\n\r\n“Prove it,” sneered Ananias.\r\n\r\n“Is it not written that when your God appeared in the burning bush,\r\nMoses drew near, but when he saw the serpent, which is my god, he fled?”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Berenice, answering for the silent Ananias, “and a few\r\nsteps sufficed to put him beyond reach of the serpent. But how can one\r\nflee from _our_ God, Who fills all space, Who at one and the same time\r\nis in heaven and in earth, on sea and on land?”\r\n\r\nTheomantes, about to continue the dispute, was checked by a gesture\r\nfrom Florus, so the heathen priest, with a somewhat dark look at\r\nBerenice, subsided into silence.\r\n\r\n“You have here,” commented Rufus, “a specimen of what is always\r\nhappening in Cæsarea when Jew and Gentile meet. But, ah! here cometh\r\nthe wine.”\r\n\r\nNow, it was the fashion of that day to begin the drinking with an\r\ninvocation to the reigning emperor, and hence Florus, looking around\r\nupon his guests, lifted his cup as a sign for them to do the like,\r\nsaying at the same time:\r\n\r\n“Friends, a libation to the god Nero!”\r\n\r\nThe _god_ Nero!\r\n\r\nThough to the pagan portion of the assembly the words conveyed no\r\nimpiety, the case was otherwise with the Jews, but those present were\r\nof the worldly-wise class that sacrifices religion to policy, and hence\r\nmost of them, including the Sadducee Ananias and the Pharisee Josephus,\r\nshamelessly prepared to join with Florus in offering to the wickedest\r\nman of that age a libation as to a god.\r\n\r\nNow, pagan though Crispus was, there was one thing in the Roman\r\nreligion that he, in common with many others, could not approve, and\r\nthat was the deification of the living emperor, especially when the\r\ndeification extended to such a one as Nero. And yet to refrain from\r\njoining in the libation was dangerous, being tantamount to the guilt of\r\n_læsa majestas_; and of all crimes, the greatest, in the eyes of the\r\nbuffoon then at the head of the empire, was the refusal to acknowledge\r\nhis divinity.\r\n\r\nCome what might, Crispus determined to have no part in the libation,\r\nand while there was on all sides a preparatory lifting of cups, his own\r\nremained untouched. He found a companion in Rufus, and some others,\r\nincluding the unknown maiden, whose eyes were eloquently expressive of\r\nabhorrence.\r\n\r\nHe and those of like thought were rescued from an embarrassing\r\nsituation by the action of the Princess Berenice. With a pale face and\r\nagitated air she had risen to her feet, and in a voice trembling with\r\nsuppressed emotion she addressed the wondering assembly.\r\n\r\n“There once reigned,” she began, “and in this very city, a king who, on\r\na set day, made an oration to his people; and they cried, ‘It is the\r\nvoice of a god, and not of a man!’ And because he rebuked not their\r\nwords the hand of heaven smote him there that he died. And that king,”\r\nshe added, with a catch in her voice, “that king was my father!”\r\n\r\nThe fate of Agrippa the Elder was well known to all the guests, some\r\nof whom, indeed, had been present at that divine judgment--pronounced\r\nby the smitten king himself to be divine--and the memory of the event,\r\nadded to the impressive words and solemn manner of his fair daughter,\r\ncaused a thrill to pervade the assembly.\r\n\r\n“And now, O Florus, do you desire the like fate for Nero? To call him\r\ngod is to draw upon him the wrath of that eternal One, Who will not\r\npermit His glory to be given to another.”\r\n\r\nAs she sat down amid a murmur of approval from the better-minded, it\r\nbecame suddenly apparent to Florus that he had made a big blunder.\r\nAll-desirous as he was of winning the favor of Berenice, he had\r\nstrangely overlooked the fact that the libation in the form proposed by\r\nhim might be distasteful to the religious ideas of the Jewish princess.\r\nHe gladly seized the opportunity of extricating himself from an awkward\r\nsituation by endorsing the words of Crispus, who said:\r\n\r\n“The princess hath spoken well. Let us, O Florus, not give to a mortal,\r\nhowever highly placed, the honor that belongs only to the immortals.”\r\n\r\n“Be it as the princess wishes,” said the procurator. “We will change\r\nthe phrasing to one in which all may join.” With that he added, “To the\r\nhealth of the Emperor Nero!” and plashed upon the tesselated pavement a\r\nfew drops of the ruddy wine, an example in which he was followed by the\r\nrest of the guests, Jew and Gentile alike.\r\n\r\n“A beautiful cup, O Florus,” remarked Tertullus, attentively eyeing the\r\ngoblet from which the procurator had made his libation. “I am quite\r\ncharmed by it. May one ask for a closer look?”\r\n\r\nThe cup in question was one of those myrrhine vases imported from the\r\nfar East, vases whose delicate semi-transparent material was as much a\r\nmystery to the ancient Romans as it is to the modern antiquary.\r\n\r\n“Mark my word,” whispered Tertullus to Rufus, “if we shall not find on\r\none side of that cup a natural vein of purple curving into something\r\nlike the shape of a Grecian lyre.”\r\n\r\nFlorus, always glad to have the excellency of his treasures\r\nacknowledged, addressed a slave.\r\n\r\n“Girl, pass this cup to the noble Tertullus. A judge of art, he will\r\nknow how to appreciate such a work. By the gods, have a care how you\r\ncarry it!”\r\n\r\nThe girl, thus bidden, conveyed the vessel to Tertullus. Its chief\r\nbeauty consisted in the great variety of its colors, and the wreathing\r\nveins which here and there presented shades of purple and white, with\r\na blending of the two. As Tertullus had said, one of these veins bore\r\nconsiderable resemblance to a lyre.\r\n\r\n“I never thought to see thee again,” muttered Tertullus to himself,\r\napostrophizing the cup. “How come you here in the hands of Florus?\r\nA rare work of art,” he added aloud, as he returned the cup to the\r\nprocurator. “You have had it long?”\r\n\r\n“These seven years.”\r\n\r\n“Seven days, you mean,” murmured Tertullus; then aloud, “It must have\r\ncost an immense sum.”\r\n\r\n“Thirty talents,” replied Florus with a careless air, as though the\r\namount were a mere trifle. “There are but two vases of this kind in all\r\nthe empire; they were brought to Rome by a Parthian merchant. Petronius\r\npurchased the one, I the other.”\r\n\r\n“What a liar you are!” thought Tertullus; and then, as if dismissing\r\nthe matter altogether from his mind, he said in a low tone to Rufus:\r\n\r\n“Doth Simon the Black still linger in his dungeon?”\r\n\r\nRufus replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“May one ask,” smiled Crispus, “who is this Simon the Black?”\r\n\r\n“You are a stranger in Judæa, or you would not have to ask that\r\nquestion,” returned Rufus. “Simon the Black was till lately the\r\nchief of a robber-band of Zealots, whose haunt was among the almost\r\ninaccessible crags that overhang the Red Way, the famous pass that\r\nleads from Jerusalem to Jericho. The Jew was allowed to traverse the\r\npass in safety; the ordinary Gentile was taken captive and held to\r\nransom; but as to the Roman, woe to him if caught!--it being the way of\r\nSimon to hang all such without the alternative of a ransom. Hence he\r\nis called by those of the Jews who hate our rule, ‘The Scourge of the\r\nRomans,’ and is regarded by them as a patriot.\r\n\r\n“The curious part of it all is that Florus, though often appealed to\r\nboth by the Romans and Greeks of Cæsarea, refrained for a long time\r\nfrom sending a military expedition against this nest of robbers, and\r\nwhen at last he yielded to public pressure, and dispatched my Italian\r\nCohort on the errand, his parting words to me were, ‘I do not want to\r\nbe troubled with prisoners.’ I declined to take the hint, however, and\r\nbrought back Simon alive, much, it would seem, to the mortification\r\nof the procurator. And here at Cæsarea the fellow lies in a dungeon,\r\nFlorus strangely refusing to put him on trial.\r\n\r\n“It’s galling to think,” added Rufus, “that my work will have\r\nto be done all over again. The pass hath been seized by another\r\nbandit--Manahem, a son of that notorious Judas of Galilee, who drew\r\naway much people after him in the days of the taxing. More catholic in\r\nhis views, he plunders and slays Jews and Gentiles alike. And now again\r\nFlorus--odd, is it not?--is thwarting me in my wish to proceed against\r\nthis new malefactor.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all odd,” remarked Tertullus, “if my suspicion be correct; and,\r\nby Castor! I’ll try to verify it before twenty-four hours be past.” And\r\nthen, speaking aloud, he turned and addressed the procurator.\r\n\r\n“O Florus, do you take your place on the bema to-morrow? ’Tis a court\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nThe governor frowned at this introduction of business into the midst of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n“What cases are there to try?”\r\n\r\n“There is the case of Simon the Black. The Romans and Greeks of Cæsarea\r\nare clamoring for his trial.”\r\n\r\n“Let them clamor.”\r\n\r\n“The long delay over this matter hath so enraged them that they swear\r\nif Simon be not brought to justice by the next court day, which is\r\nto-morrow, they will storm the prison, and will themselves bring him\r\nforth to execution.”\r\n\r\n“And should they make the attempt,” remarked Rufus gravely, “I doubt\r\nvery much, O Florus, whether we can depend upon the fidelity of our\r\ncohorts to prevent it. This Simon hath slain so many Romans that\r\nmilitary and civilians alike are desirous of seeing him brought to\r\njustice.”\r\n\r\nFlorus, looking very ill at ease, was silent for a moment.\r\n\r\n“You are convinced that our captive is really the Simon the Black, and\r\nthat he hath committed the crimes attributed to him?”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” replied Tertullus. “I have documents and witnesses enough to\r\nprove his guilt twenty times over.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, need we go to the trouble of a public trial? Since you are\r\ncertain of his guilt, I will do as did Antipas with him that was called\r\n‘The Baptist’--send an executioner to his cell. How say you? Speak the\r\nword, and within an hour you shall have his head here upon a charger.”\r\n\r\n“Antipas’ act is a bad precedent,” returned Tertullus. “Your\r\npredecessor Festus, as Ananias there can testify, was more equitably\r\nminded. ‘It is not the manner of the Romans,’ said he, ‘to deliver any\r\nman to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to\r\nface, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid\r\nagainst him.’”[4]\r\n\r\n“Words deserving to be written in letters of gold,” commented Crispus,\r\nto the manifest displeasure of Florus.\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” observed Rufus, “the people will never believe Simon dead\r\nif he be secretly executed.”\r\n\r\n“They will, when they see his head over the Prætorium gate.”\r\n\r\n“His crimes have been open and public,” said Tertullus, “let his trial\r\nbe so.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow?” said Florus. “Why not the next day?”\r\n\r\n“The day after to-morrow is a sabbath,” replied Tertullus. “The Jewish\r\nwitnesses will refuse to attend court on that day.”\r\n\r\n“The sabbath! the sabbath!” repeated Florus pettishly. “Why is the\r\nsabbath greater than any other day?”\r\n\r\n“Why are you greater than other men?” asked Berenice gently.\r\n\r\n“Because, princess, it hath pleased Cæsar to make me so.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, it hath pleased the Lord to make the Sabbath a greater day\r\nthan any other,” smiled Berenice, never at a loss for an answer where\r\nher religion was concerned.\r\n\r\n“Will not the noble Florus,” said Crispus, “state the reasons for his\r\ndelay in bringing this prisoner to trial?”\r\n\r\nThe noble Florus did not reply to this pointed question. He frowned,\r\nand hesitated; but, with a son of the all-powerful Legate of Syria\r\npresent as a witness of his irregularities, he felt he could not do\r\notherwise than grant the just request of Tertullus.\r\n\r\n“Have, then, your way,” said he. “In the morning Simon shall be put\r\nupon his trial.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that he resumed his conversation with Berenice.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be sorry for that concession,” laughed Tertullus quietly; and\r\nthen, turning to Rufus, he added, “See that Simon’s guards sleep not\r\nto-night. Florus is quite capable of taking him off secretly.”\r\n\r\n“You mean----”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” whispered Tertullus, “that the deferring of the trial is due\r\nto the fact that this Zealot, if brought into open court, could say\r\nsomething to the detriment of Florus; what, I would fain find out.\r\nTherefore, I say again, look well to the prisoner to-night.”\r\n\r\nRufus promised that he would see to the matter.\r\n\r\nAt this point the ears of the guests were attracted by a sound like\r\nthat of cords passing over pulleys, and looking whence it came, they\r\nsaw a curtain that draped a wide archway ascend, revealing behind it a\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the palate of the guests was being regaled with the\r\nchoicest of wines, their eyes were gratified by a series of beautiful\r\ntableaux drawn from the domain of classic mythology. The last of these\r\nrepresented the Judgment of Paris; by a trifling departure from the\r\noriginal story, the prize of the fairest goddess was to be a golden\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nParis, apparently unable to come to a decision as to which of the\r\nthree diaphanously-attired goddesses was the fairest, made the award\r\ndependent upon their dancing. At this there followed _pas seuls_\r\nof such a character that the modest maiden who sat by Josephus was\r\ncompelled to avert her gaze.\r\n\r\nVenus, having received the award from the hand of the Dardan shepherd,\r\nadvanced to the edge of the stage, and surveyed the audience.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” she cried with a sudden sigh, “Paris has made a mistake, for I\r\nsee one here more lovely than myself. Let the gift be hers, and let her\r\nbe hailed as Queen of Beauty.”\r\n\r\nWith that she unclasped the golden cestus and flung it into the middle\r\nof the hall just as the curtain was falling upon the tableau.\r\n\r\nA slave, picking up the fallen zone, carried it to Florus.\r\n\r\n“‘ΚΑΛΛΙΣΤΗ’--‘for the fairest,’” said he, reading the sapphire letters\r\nset in the golden cestus. “The question is,” continued Florus, looking\r\nround upon a bevy of ladies who had drawn near to view the zone, and it\r\nwas well worth viewing for its beautiful workmanship, “the question is,\r\nwho _is_ the fairest?”\r\n\r\nBut, however fair each lady might secretly deem herself, as there was\r\nnot found any bold enough to come forward and claim this title, it\r\nbecame clear that, if the zone must be bestowed at all, it would be\r\nnecessary to appoint an umpire to decide this ticklish matter.\r\n\r\nThe ladies, entering with a zest into the scheme, were quite willing,\r\nso they averred, to submit their charms to adjudication.\r\n\r\n“A pretty little tableau, this,” whispered Rufus to Crispus,\r\n“prearranged by Florus for the purpose of flattering the vanity of\r\nBerenice. His liking for her is so well known that whoever is appointed\r\numpire--unless he be a very independent character--will lack the\r\ncourage to decide for any but the princess.”\r\n\r\nA proposal on the part of Tertullus to appoint the umpire by lot was\r\nreceived with acclamation. Crispus, somewhat against his will, was\r\nforced by Rufus to take his place among the candidates for the office,\r\nand, what is more, when his turn came for putting his hand into the\r\nballoting urn he drew forth the tessera inscribed with the decisive\r\nword, “_Judex_.”\r\n\r\nHe compressed his lips, much preferring that the honor should have\r\nfallen upon some other.\r\n\r\nRufus now made a proposition.\r\n\r\n“Methinks it is but fair,” said he, “that the lady round whose waist\r\nthe zone is clasped should bestow a kiss upon the adjudicator.”\r\n\r\nThis was laughingly made one of the conditions of the contest.\r\n\r\nAnd now, amid much mirth, about twenty of the ladies began to prepare\r\nfor the event. The rest, either from modesty or distrustful of their\r\ncharms, drew aside, content to look on.\r\n\r\nAmong those who would fain have withdrawn, not only from the contest,\r\nbut also from the palace itself, was the young girl who had so much\r\nattracted the notice of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Let us go,” she whispered in a distressed voice to Josephus. “This is\r\nno place for me.”\r\n\r\nBut he sought gently to persuade her, by dwelling upon the value and\r\nbeauty of the jeweled zone, the ease with which it was obtainable,\r\nthe pride and pleasure she would feel in being hailed as the Queen of\r\nBeauty.\r\n\r\n“The zone will not fall to _me_,” said she. “Look, and see how many\r\nbeautiful women there are around.”\r\n\r\n“None so beautiful as you, Vashti.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her golden tresses at what she deemed his partiality. In the\r\nend, however, she consented to let her will be overborne by his.\r\n\r\nThe fair contestants were now moving to the place of judgment, a\r\nspacious hemicycle at one end of the banqueting hall. Among them were\r\nthe Princess Berenice, and the Syrian Asenath, the favorite of Ananias.\r\n\r\nAs Vashti moved forward, her air of innocence and purity seemed to\r\ngive secret offense to the wanton dancing-girl; her lip curled with\r\ncontempt, and resolving to strip the other of her veil of modesty, she\r\ncame out with a proposal of a malicious and daring character.\r\n\r\n“How can it be told,” cried she, “who is the loveliest, so long as we\r\nremain clothed? The robe may hide deformities. Let it be a condition,\r\nO Florus, that in this contest we appear naked.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, she laid both hands upon her swelling hips ready to\r\nfling off her robes at the least encouragement.\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that in the Floralia at Rome women were accustomed to dance\r\nquite naked, and that at Etruscan banquets the ladies often showed\r\ntheir fair forms without any clothing whatever, the proposal of Asenath\r\nwas not quite so startling as it would be at the present day.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, screams of dissent from the fair contestants\r\nthemselves, but to the gilded and decadent youth of that assembly,\r\nGentile and Jew alike, living only for sensuality, Asenath’s suggestion\r\nmet with a ready approval. Not even the high priest, Ananias, lifted\r\nhis voice against it. The Princess Berenice stood like a statue,\r\nstately and still, neither assenting nor dissenting. As for Vashti, her\r\ncheeks had become of a deathly white, her whole air and attitude were\r\neloquent of a vivid horror at finding herself amid a circle of gilded\r\nyouth who stood by waiting only the word of Florus, to assist her,\r\n_volentem_, _nolentem_, in the task of disrobing.\r\n\r\n“What says the excellent Florus?” cried Asenath.\r\n\r\n“The proposal seems to me to be fair, for the robe, as you say, may\r\nhide deformities. But,” he continued, becoming secretly conscious that\r\nCrispus did not favor the idea, “the question is out of my hands; it\r\nrests with the adjudicator.”\r\n\r\n“And _he_,” replied Crispus, “decides that the ladies shall remain\r\nclothed. This is a contest for beauty, and there is no beauty where\r\nthere is no modesty.”\r\n\r\n“O good and pious youth, ascend to heaven!” said Asenath with a mocking\r\nlaugh; and realizing that _her_ chance of winning the zone was gone,\r\nshe stepped from the contending circle to the side of Ananias, who\r\nlooked by no means pleased with the decision of Crispus. He, the\r\npriest of a religion that claimed to be purer far than any of the\r\npagan systems, had received a tacit rebuke from a pagan--a mortifying\r\nexperience, the more so as he secretly felt it to be deserved.\r\n\r\nCompliant with the directions of Florus, the contestants took their\r\nstation upon a low marble seat that lined the hemicycle; and, when so\r\nplaced, presented a variety of faces so dazzling in beauty as to make\r\nthe adjudicator’s task a hard one.\r\n\r\nAs if to enhance his difficulty, Crispus received at that moment a\r\npiece of news somewhat startling in character.\r\n\r\nTouched upon the shoulder by a hand, he turned, and, to his surprise,\r\nfound Polemo by his side. If the Pontic king had been present at the\r\nbanquet Crispus had certainly missed seeing him, nor could he now tell\r\nfrom what corner he had sprung.\r\n\r\n“_Athenaïs is among the contestants!_” whispered the king; and ere\r\nCrispus could put a question to him, Polemo had slipped among the\r\ncrowd that was standing around to watch the sight, and had vanished\r\nas mysteriously as he had appeared, leaving Crispus in a whirl of\r\namazement.\r\n\r\nHis wife among the contestants!\r\n\r\nStern justice required that the prize should be given to the fairest,\r\nbut still, for all that, it would be a graceful compliment to let his\r\nwife have the honor; it would certainly please her, who was now the one\r\nwoman whom it behoved him to please. But how to identify her?\r\n\r\nThere was additional embarrassment in the fact that the chosen lady, on\r\nreceiving the girdle, was to bestow a kiss upon the judge that had so\r\nhonored her. To be kissed, in the presence of his unknown wife, by a\r\nlady adjudged by him to be the fairest of all present! If by some good\r\nfortune the lady chosen should happen to be Athenaïs, well!--but if\r\nnot, what would her feelings be? No wonder Crispus shrank from the task\r\nof selection, and thought for a moment of retiring in favor of some\r\nother umpire.\r\n\r\nThe contestants were now ready awaiting the judgment.\r\n\r\nPermitted to adopt whatever attitude they pleased, the majority posed\r\nas if for a sculptor. A few stood or sat, but the greater part assumed\r\na reclining posture, as being the better adapted to display the grace\r\nof their figure. Extraneous ornaments were allowed; and hence one lady,\r\nlyre in hand, posed as the muse Polyhymnia; a second, toying with\r\na golden vase, assumed the character of a Danaïd; a third, for the\r\npurpose of showing the curve of a graceful arm, held aloft a silver\r\nlamp; while a fourth displayed a snowy limb in the feigned operation\r\nof tying her sandal; and so on of the rest, each forming in herself a\r\nliving picture that would have charmed the eye of an artist.\r\n\r\nMidway in the hemicycle sat Berenice, who, neglecting all adventitious\r\naids, merely sat erect, as if relying solely upon her beauty, and next\r\nher came the timid Vashti, taking that place as being the only one left\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\nHolding the girdle in his hand, Crispus went very slowly along the\r\nsemicircle, passing from one fair form to another, and studying each\r\nwith a critical eye.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of the ladies during this severe scrutiny offered a\r\nvariety of contrasts. Some blushed, as did Vashti; others, like\r\nBerenice, sat with serene dignity, as if unconscious of the matter in\r\nhand; some sought to win favor by a caressing glance; others used the\r\nwitchery of a sweet smile; and one or two there were that could not\r\nrefrain from laughter.\r\n\r\nThe completion of his survey left Crispus undecided, and disappointed:\r\nAthenaïs, if she were really among these ladies, was evidently\r\ndetermined to keep her secret, since she had given no sign by which he\r\nmight recognize her. Among the many sparkling rings worn by that fair\r\nbevy, there was none that he could identify as the pledge placed by\r\nhim upon the finger of his bride twenty-four hours ago, the ring set\r\nwith a ruby sculptured with the likeness of a temple in flames.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crispus went very slowly along the semicircle]\r\n\r\nSince his bride chose to hide her identity there remained nothing for\r\nhim but to act in the spirit of strict impartiality by awarding the\r\nzone to her whose beauty in his judgment was most deserving of it,\r\na difficult matter where all were so beautiful. Even that _arbiter\r\nelegantiarum_, Petronius (of whose friendship Florus had boasted), had\r\nhe been present would have found the question a perplexing one.\r\n\r\nCrispus recommenced his survey, amid the breathless excitement of those\r\nmost immediately concerned.\r\n\r\n“He has seen us all,” was the general thought; “now he will make his\r\nchoice.”\r\n\r\nHalf-way along the line he paused--hesitated--stood still. Directly\r\nfacing him were the Princess Berenice and the maiden Vashti. His\r\nglance, divided between them, showed that one of these two was to\r\nbe his choice, and a little sigh of envy went up from eighteen\r\ndisappointed hearts.\r\n\r\nFor some moments Crispus stood in doubt. Their beauty was equal, or\r\nnearly so.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Berenice, with her raven hair, dusky eyes, and majestic\r\nbearing, seemed like the incarnation of dark and starry night; the\r\nother, with her soft violet eyes, tresses like sunbeams, and gentle\r\nmien, was like fair Aurora sweetly stealing upon the eastern sky.\r\n\r\n“If there were but two prizes!” murmured the unhappy Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Why does he hesitate?” growled Florus. “Is it not plain to be seen\r\nthat Berenice is the fairer?”\r\n\r\nThat girdle had cost him thirty thousand sesterces, and he did not want\r\nto see it bestowed upon a person for whom he had not intended it.\r\n\r\nBerenice met the scrutiny of her judge with a proud glance, betokening\r\na confidence that Crispus, who loved modesty, did not like to see; on\r\nthe other hand, Vashti ventured but once to raise her eyes with a\r\nsweet, timid, wondering air that moved him strangely.\r\n\r\nThat glance decided the event!\r\n\r\n“Lady,” said he, “what is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus,” was the reply, delivered in a low,\r\ntrembling voice.\r\n\r\n“Then Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus, as the fairest of all present,\r\nreceive this golden zone.”\r\n\r\nVashti was but human; it was a sweet little triumph for her. There\r\nleaped into her eyes a sudden look of pleasure, a look that was\r\nsucceeded by one almost akin to fear as she glanced at the humiliated\r\nprincess, whose beauty, long supreme in Judæa, was now publicly\r\nrelegated to a second place.\r\n\r\nHalf pleased, half frightened, scarcely knowing what she was doing,\r\nVashti rose to her feet, an act that gave Crispus the opportunity of\r\ngirding her waist with the zone, and securing it with the clasp.\r\n\r\nThe conferring of the prize upon a Jewess occasioned dissatisfaction\r\namong some of the Gentiles; a few, too, of the Jews resented that the\r\nHerodian princess should be excluded in favor of an unknown maiden. In\r\nboth parties there was, however, a majority which, more generous in\r\nsentiment, or perhaps thinking that Berenice and her beauty had queened\r\nit too long over other women, expressed its approbation by the shout:\r\n\r\n“All hail to Vashti, the Queen of Beauty!”\r\n\r\n“Is not the umpire, too, entitled to a reward?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\nVashti started back with a burning blush that made her look the more\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n“Nay, I must not forego it.”\r\n\r\nHe was so completely dazzled by her loveliness as to forget for the\r\nmoment that his unknown bride was watching him. Taking Vashti by both\r\nhands he drew her gently towards him, and momentarily pressed her warm,\r\nred lips to his own, an act greeted by the company with another round\r\nof applause.\r\n\r\nAll very pretty, but what would Polemo think of it?\r\n\r\nBecoming suddenly alive to the existence of that monarch he looked\r\naround for him, and saw him at a distance surveying the scene with a\r\nsphinx-like expression that gave no evidence as to what thoughts were\r\npassing within him. Crispus took a step in his direction, but the king,\r\nas if wishing to avoid him, vanished among the crowd, and was seen no\r\nmore that night.\r\n\r\nA little later Rufus addressed a question to Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Did you notice Berenice’s look when you bestowed the prize of beauty\r\nupon Vashti?”\r\n\r\n“No; how did she look?” asked Crispus absently.\r\n\r\n“She looked--she looked,” said Rufus reflectively, as if casting\r\nabout in his mind for some image to express his thoughts, “she looked\r\nthe picture of sorrow. She looked--well, don’t laugh if I use this\r\ncomparison--she looked as a wife who loves her husband might look when\r\nshe sees him fascinated by another woman.”\r\n\r\nCrispus started, stared strangely at Rufus, then walked away.\r\n\r\n“Now what have I said to offend him?” muttered the wondering Rufus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                          THE DREAM OF CRISPUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTempted by the beauty of the starry night, as well as by the wish to\r\nbe alone with his thoughts, Crispus passed from the banqueting hall,\r\nand sought the spacious gardens attached to the Prætorium, gardens that\r\nwith their variegated parterres and smooth lawns, marble fountains and\r\nshady walks, differed little, if at all, from the aspect presented by a\r\nmodern pleasaunce.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new under the sun! Even the practice of forcing\r\nshrubbery to assume artificial shapes was not unknown to the ancients,\r\nand the boscage of these gardens presented at different points a\r\nvariety of figures, graceful and grotesque.\r\n\r\nNow, as Crispus walked meditatively along a quiet path he caught\r\nsight of a distant and solitary figure standing by a marble seat that\r\ngleamed white against a background of dark cypresses. Her face was\r\nturned from him, but there was something familiar in her form; the\r\nstature and shape suggested Berenice, and as he drew nearer he became\r\ncertain of it. At the sound of his footsteps the figure turned, and\r\ndimly, beneath the gloom cast by the cypress leaves, he saw the face of\r\nBerenice--Berenice, yet with golden hair! He stopped short in surprise.\r\nThen in a moment the likeness that he had seen, or thought he had seen,\r\nvanished, leaving in its place--Vashti! He looked, but the resemblance\r\nwas no more. A mere fancy wrought by his imagination and the dim light.\r\n\r\nVashti greeted him with a shy smile, and a blush due to the memory of\r\nthe kiss that he had bestowed upon her.\r\n\r\nShe was awaiting, it seemed, the return of Josephus. He had left her\r\nthere for a moment while he ran off to speak a word with Ananias, whom\r\nhe had beheld in the distance.\r\n\r\nCrispus looked round, but could see neither Ananias nor Josephus; in\r\nfact could see no one save the beautiful maiden beside him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll act as your guardian till his return,” smiled he, as he seated\r\nhimself and invited Vashti to do the like.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful night, with nothing to disturb its stillness save\r\nthe far-off sounds of music and revelry coming from the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nTheir position, on ground slightly elevated, gave them a full view of\r\nthe sea, a purple mirror reflecting in broken sparkles the light of a\r\nthousand stars.\r\n\r\nTo their left, and looking like a long white ribbon flung out upon\r\nthe dark water, was the mole of Cæsarea, its far end adorned with\r\nthe Drusion, a noble tower upon whose top a fire was flaming for the\r\nguidance of ships sailing into the harbor.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, upon the Drusion that Crispus’ eyes were set,\r\nbut upon Vashti. He longed to know something of her personal history,\r\nand the present occasion afforded him an excellent opportunity. The\r\ndifficulty was how to begin. A patrician of Rome, who had in his time\r\nconversed unrestrainedly with princesses and queens, and even with the\r\nEmpress Poppæa, he actually found himself embarrassed in the presence\r\nof this Hebrew maid of seventeen. There was something about her, a\r\nspirit of innocence and purity, that marked her off as altogether\r\ndifferent from the women of that age.\r\n\r\nHowever, having once contrived to begin a conversation he found it easy\r\nto maintain it, and ere long he succeeded in eliciting something of her\r\nparentage and history.\r\n\r\nHer mother, it seemed, was a widow, Miriam by name, who had one other\r\nchild only, an infant. Her father, Hyrcanus, had been a wealthy rabbi\r\nof some distinction. (“Clearly Tertullus was wrong,” thought Crispus,\r\n“in giving her a Grecian origin.”) Hyrcanus, at his death, an event of\r\nthe previous year, had by will left his family and effects to the care\r\nof his friend Josephus, who thus exercised in relation to Vashti the\r\noffice of guardian. She and her mother were staying for a brief space\r\nonly at Cæsarea, their usual home being at Jerusalem, in the street of\r\nMillo. Miriam, a strictly orthodox Jewess, had been much opposed to her\r\ndaughter’s going to a Gentile feast, but had finally yielded to the\r\nwishes of Josephus.\r\n\r\nAll this was told, not in her native Syro-Chaldaic, but in Greek; and\r\nCrispus did not know which was the more charming, the melody of her\r\nvoice, or the grace and purity with which she spoke the beautiful\r\nlanguage of Hellas.\r\n\r\n“I learned the Greek from my father,” she explained in answer to\r\nCrispus’ question. “He trained me in it from infancy.”\r\n\r\nCrispus marveled to hear of a Jew with views so unorthodox.\r\n\r\n“According to my friend Rufus, your rabbis have said, ‘He who teaches\r\nhis son Greek is as if he reared swine.’”\r\n\r\n“_Some_ rabbis have said that. But my father belonged to the school\r\nof Gamaliel, who taught us to appropriate whatever is good among the\r\nGentiles. The Greek language is good, and Josephus and I are availing\r\nourselves of its treasures.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\nInstead of giving a direct reply, Vashti asked a seemingly irrelevant\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“How old should you take our nation to be?”\r\n\r\nAs Hebrew history formed no part of the study of Roman youth, Crispus\r\nwas fain to confess his ignorance.\r\n\r\n“Well, how old is Rome?”\r\n\r\n“More than eight hundred years,” he answered with conscious pride.\r\n\r\n“Which proves your nation, when compared with ours, to be but of\r\nyesterday. We Jews were a people a thousand years before Romulus drew\r\nhis plow along the Palatine.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, jealous for the antiquity of his nation, was disposed to\r\nquestion Vashti’s statement.\r\n\r\n“Why, you are as skeptical as Apion. You have heard of Apion?”\r\n\r\n“No,” laughed Crispus. “Who was he?”\r\n\r\n“A grammarian of Alexandria, and the author of a work intended to show\r\nthat we Jews are quite a recent nation in the history of the world,\r\na libel that has so wrought upon the spirit of Josephus that he is\r\nwriting a reply, whose title is to be ‘_Contra Apion_.’”\r\n\r\n“And you are aiding him in the work? Come, deny it not!”\r\n\r\nVashti smiled assent.\r\n\r\n“I act as his amanuensis,” added she.\r\n\r\nA Hebrew maiden of seventeen versed in Grecian literature was a novelty\r\nto Crispus. Curious to know whether her learning was anything more than\r\nsuperficial, he ventured, with her own consent, to subject her to a\r\ncatechism derived from the reminiscences of a two-years’ curriculum in\r\nthe schools of Athens, but soon relinquished the task on finding her\r\nknowledge far more extensive than his own.\r\n\r\n“You have been questioning me,” said she with a smile, sweet yet grave,\r\nwhen he had finished. “Now may I claim a like privilege?”\r\n\r\n“In order to demonstrate my ignorance,” laughed Crispus. “Well, I’ll\r\nput myself under examination. Be not too hard with me.”\r\n\r\nThus adjured, Vashti began.\r\n\r\n“Why does your Greek poet Bianor, in commenting upon the fable of\r\nArion, who was cast into the sea by the sailors but saved by the\r\ndolphins, say it is meant to teach us that ‘_By man comes death, but by\r\nthe Fish salvation_’?”[5]\r\n\r\nThis, Crispus thought, was a very odd question. He had merely heard\r\nof Bianor as a poet living in the days of Tiberius; and that was the\r\nextent of his knowledge concerning him. As to the passage quoted by\r\nVashti, it had no meaning for him. The words, however true of the\r\nfabled Arion, were scarcely applicable to mankind at large.\r\n\r\nOver Vashti’s face there passed a shade as of sadness, momentary only,\r\nbut it did not escape Crispus’ quick eye.\r\n\r\n“I thought perhaps you might have comprehended,” said she. “Your story\r\ntold to-night at the banquet, the story of ‘Great Pan,’ led me to hope\r\nthat--that--no matter! I see now that I was wrong,” she added with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\nSaddened because she found him unable to explain an obscure line of a\r\nGreek poet! Why, what an odd maiden was this! And the curious part of\r\nit all was, she refused to enlighten him; and hence he could not but\r\nconclude that Vashti had some secret to which the poet’s words were the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nThe conversation flowed on, and soon touched upon Jewish antiquity\r\nagain. There were Jews, so Vashti averred, Josephus for example, who\r\ncould carry back an authentic ancestry over a space of two thousand\r\nyears. Crispus was wont to pride himself upon his ancient family, but\r\nwhat was its antiquity compared with such as these?\r\n\r\n“And can _you_ show so long a genealogy?”\r\n\r\n“My father Hyrcanus could.”\r\n\r\nCrispus thought this a somewhat odd reply.\r\n\r\n“But if _he_ could, so can _you_, seeing that you are his daughter.”\r\n\r\n“Only those genealogies are deemed authentic that are inscribed on the\r\npublic rolls. _My_ name is missing from them.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I cannot tell, but such is the case. I discovered it but a few\r\ndays ago. I was in the Archeion--the House of the Rolls, we call\r\nit--with its keeper Johanan ben Zacchai, who has always regarded me\r\nwith fatherly affection. Moved by curiosity, I asked to be allowed to\r\nsee my own name in the public genealogical records. ‘Well, to please\r\nyou, my daughter,’ said he. So he brought out the rolls of papyrus and\r\nparchment; and after a long time, and much searching, he found the\r\nnames of my father Hyrcanus, and my mother Miriam, but _my_ name he\r\ncould not find, though my little brother Arad’s is recorded. So you\r\nsee----”\r\n\r\nThe sound of approaching footsteps checked her utterance. On turning,\r\nCrispus and Vashti saw at a little distance a stately and beautiful\r\nfigure that for a moment stopped short, apparently in surprise,\r\nat seeing the pair in such friendly converse. It was the Princess\r\nBerenice. Some instinct told Crispus that she was looking for him,\r\nand he beheld her with a sort of self-reproach. In spite of her\r\nhalf-jesting reminder that he should not, as at Antioch, neglect her,\r\nhe had repeated his indifference; his only dealing with her had been\r\nto depose her from the proud position of being the first beauty of the\r\nland. What wonder, then, if she should feel somewhat hurt?\r\n\r\n“I will leave you now,” murmured Vashti, making as if to rise.\r\n\r\n“Nay, do not go,” said Crispus, venturing, all unconsciously, to lay a\r\ndetaining hand upon her wrist.\r\n\r\nCrispus wondered at her heightened color, and at the new light that\r\ncame into her eyes. Was she pleased to think that he would not dismiss\r\nher, even in favor of a princess?\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his hand, but not before Berenice had noticed the action.\r\nObservant woman is doubly observant at such times.\r\n\r\n“Will the Queen of Beauty,” said the princess with a slightly\r\ndisdainful air, “permit me to share the conversation of the noble\r\nCrispus?” And, without waiting for a reply, she seated herself, as she\r\nspoke, at the left side of Crispus, Vashti being at his right.\r\n\r\n“What is passing in the palace?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“The wit of Florus,” replied Berenice. “The wine hath got into his\r\nhead. Like Nero, he thinks he can sing. But I was very good, and kept\r\na grave face the while; nay, I even asked him to sing again, which\r\npleased him hugely. I cannot say the same of his hearers.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed so pleasantly that Crispus was fain to laugh too.\r\n\r\nAnd now there began on the part of Berenice a flow of talk that,\r\nsometimes witty, sometimes wise, was always interesting. She touched\r\non topics grave and gay, from the government of the empire to the\r\nlatest fashion in sandals, never failing to illumine the subject in\r\nhand with some subtle observation. She had the field all to herself,\r\nfor Vashti was content to be a listener, while Crispus put in a remark\r\nnow and again. It seemed almost as if Berenice, surmising that Crispus\r\nhad found a fascination in Vashti’s conversation, had determined to\r\ndisplay her own brilliancy. And certainly the character of both was a\r\nrevelation to Crispus, who, accustomed hitherto, in the haughty and\r\nexclusive spirit of his race, to regard the Jews as an inferior nation,\r\nwas agreeably surprised to find among these “barbarians” two women who,\r\nwhile equal in beauty to any Greek or Roman lady known to him, were\r\ncertainly superior in intellect and charm.\r\n\r\n“’Tis the first day of the new moon,” observed Berenice, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I see her not,” returned Crispus, glancing over the face of the sky,\r\nand thereby missing Berenice’s little frown. A foe to paganism, she\r\ndid not like to hear personality ascribed to the moon.\r\n\r\n“Its slender crescent is visible at Jerusalem, if not from here,” said\r\nBerenice. “_That_ tells me so.”\r\n\r\nShe pointed to a far-off peak upon the southern horizon, a peak upon\r\nwhich there had appeared a light no larger than a star. The sparkle was\r\nrepeated at a point northward of the first; a third followed; and soon\r\na whole line of fires was twinkling upon the hill-summits of Judæa.\r\n\r\n“Our way of announcing the first day of the month,” explained Berenice.\r\n“So soon as the new moon is seen from a certain hill near Jerusalem by\r\nwatchers appointed of the Sanhedrim for that purpose, the tidings is\r\nflashed by fire-signals throughout all the land. ’Tis an old custom\r\nlately revived by the high priest Matthias. But I will not weary you\r\nwith matters in which a Roman can take no interest.”\r\n\r\n“There you err, princess. My visit to Jerusalem--for thither am I\r\nbound--is undertaken for the sole purpose of seeing your temple.”\r\n\r\n“You wish to see our temple?” exclaimed the princess in great surprise,\r\n“you, who at the banquet avowed yourself a worshiper of the gods of\r\nRome! What interest can our temple have for _you_?”\r\n\r\n“My interest is the outcome of a--a----”; he hesitated for a moment,\r\nand then added, “a dream.”\r\n\r\nA statement so singular naturally evoked Berenice’s curiosity, and she\r\nbegged him to tell the dream. Vashti, though she said nothing, was, as\r\nCrispus could see by her looks, equally curious to hear it.\r\n\r\n“I wish now that I could recall my words,” said he, “for though it was\r\nbut a dream, the telling of it may cause me to fall into disfavor with\r\nyou both.”\r\n\r\nThat “both” was a distasteful word to Berenice, seeming, as it did,\r\nto imply that he thought as much of Vashti’s opinion as of her own.\r\nEvidently he did, for it was not till Vashti had added a persuasive\r\nword that he would begin his story.\r\n\r\n“A few nights ago,” said he, plunging at once _in medias res_, “I\r\nseemed in my sleep to be standing in what appeared to be the court of\r\nsome magnificent temple. This court, colonnaded on its four sides, was\r\na spacious one and open to the sky. It was night, and the stars faintly\r\ntwinkled. Before me at some distance rose the temple itself, an edifice\r\nconstructed of pure white marble.\r\n\r\n“The place was not quiet--far from it. Singular to relate, although no\r\none was visible, the court seemed to be thronged with men. There was a\r\nrunning to and fro over the pavement, the clash and clang of arms, and\r\nthe sound of warriors engaged in deadly fray. I laid hand to my sword,\r\ndesiring to range myself on the one side or the other, but how could\r\none take part in a combat like this--a combat of ghosts?\r\n\r\n“Suddenly I became conscious of a glow; in front of me, upon a low\r\nbalustrade, lay a flaming torch. As I looked at it a voice, seeming\r\nto come from the sky, cried in the Hebrew tongue, ‘_Burn!_’ and the\r\nflambeau shook itself as if impatient to be grasped. I hesitated. Again\r\nthe voice cried, ‘_Burn!_’ in a tone so awe-inspiring that I durst not\r\ndisobey. I lifted the burning brand, and tossed it through a golden\r\nwindow of the temple. A shower of sparks rose from within; next came a\r\ntongue of fire, leaping forth from the window; a little while and the\r\nwhole structure was mantled with flame and smoke. At the same instant I\r\nawoke.”\r\n\r\nBerenice’s dusky eyes, eloquent with a nameless fear, were set full\r\nupon the speaker’s face.\r\n\r\n“Can you describe the temple seen by you in the vision?”\r\n\r\n“I can shut my eyes now,” said Crispus, suiting the action to the word,\r\n“and recall every feature. I am standing on the north side of the\r\ntemple; it extends east and west for a length of perhaps two hundred\r\nand fifty cubits. To enter it one must first pass a low balustrade of\r\nmarble, curiously wrought, upon which stand little pillars engraved\r\nwith a notice in Greek and Latin letters. I have a distinct remembrance\r\nin my dream of reading the notice. It forbade the Gentiles on pain of\r\ndeath from entering the shrine.”\r\n\r\nBoth Vashti and Berenice gave a faint cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n“Did you speak, princess?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! Go on. What next?” she asked breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“After passing the balustrade one has the choice of four gates, each\r\nascended by a stately flight of stairs fifteen in number. Of these\r\ngates, three, situated near the western end, are near each other; the\r\nfourth stands far remote towards the eastern end. Each gate consists\r\nof two folding doors, crusted with gold and silver, and is flanked by\r\nmassive towers.” He paused for a moment, and resumed: “I related this\r\nvision to my father, who was as much startled, princess, as you appear\r\nto be. ‘What you have seen,’ said he, ‘is the temple at Jerusalem.’ Can\r\nyou wonder, then, that I desire to take a view of it?”\r\n\r\n“And did you know nothing of the interior of our temple till the time\r\nof this dream?” asked Berenice.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely nothing, I pledge you my solemn word. I was, of course,\r\naware that Jerusalem contained a notable temple resorted to by devout\r\nJews out of every nation under heaven, but that was the total extent of\r\nmy knowledge. Not a single detail of its architecture was known to me.”\r\n\r\nBerenice seemed perplexed, even troubled.\r\n\r\n“Strange! whence comes this dream of yours?” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“You do not doubt the vision?”\r\n\r\n“How can I, since you affirm it to be true?”\r\n\r\n“You admit that my description is correct?”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be gainsaid.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, since it is beyond the power of the human mind, whether\r\nsleeping or awake, to gain such knowledge as I gained at that time,\r\nshall I offend you by saying that the vision was directly vouchsafed to\r\nme by the immortal gods?”\r\n\r\n“The gods?” returned the princess with a touch of disdain in her voice.\r\n“The gods? The gods of you Gentiles have no existence. There is but one\r\ntrue and living God.”\r\n\r\n“Have it so,” replied Crispus, who seemingly could tolerate reflections\r\nupon his religion much more easily than Berenice could upon hers.\r\n“Shall we say, then, that the vision was sent by your own deity?”\r\n\r\n“Impossible! Would He Who has enjoined upon us the perpetual worship of\r\nHimself give command to destroy the one and only temple in which that\r\nworship is carried on?”\r\n\r\n“He might,” observed Vashti, “if He purposed to make His religion more\r\nspiritual. Pure religion requires neither temple nor altar.”\r\n\r\n“There speaks one who is no true daughter of Abraham,” retorted\r\nBerenice.\r\n\r\n“Nay, princess, it is because I _am_ a daughter of Abraham that I say\r\nit, for what temple did Abraham have?”\r\n\r\nBerenice, about to make an angry retort, was checked by Crispus.\r\n\r\n“We are drifting from the primary question,” said he, “which is, whence\r\ncame my dream? That dream was plainly a supernatural one.”\r\n\r\n“Whence?” returned Berenice. “Whence but from the kingdom of evil?\r\nThere are wicked spirits as well as good, and the prince of them is\r\nnamed Satan, who would rejoice if he could but persuade a Roman to\r\ndestroy the temple. I pray you, noble Crispus,” she continued, with\r\nconsiderable emotion, “dismiss this dream from your mind, lest by\r\ndwelling overmuch upon it you should come to believe that you have a\r\nDivine mission to destroy the temple.”\r\n\r\n“It may be that I have.”\r\n\r\nCrispus spoke with the grave air of one who believes in the truth of\r\nhis words. For a moment the princess gazed at him, speechless with\r\nconsternation. Recovering her voice, she cried indignantly:\r\n\r\n“What good could come from such a deed?”\r\n\r\n“Much--to Rome!”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“That temple,” said Crispus, speaking in a cold, deadly tone that set\r\nBerenice shivering with terror, for she loved her temple more than her\r\nlife, “that temple draws annually to its courts three million Jews, all\r\nanimated by a fierce hatred of Rome, and all fanatically persuaded that\r\nOne born in Judæa shall obtain the dominion of the world. You know it\r\nis so, princess; you cannot deny it. Your temple is a perpetual menace\r\nto the safety of the empire. Destroy the temple, and we put an end to\r\nthese annual gatherings with their vain and treasonable hopes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                            SIMON THE ZEALOT\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning after the banquet there flew through Cæsarea the\r\nsurprising news that the notable Zealot, Simon the Black, was to be put\r\non his trial on the noon of that same day.\r\n\r\nEager to witness the scene, a motley crowd, composed of Jews and\r\nGreeks, Romans and Syrians, flocked, long before the appointed time,\r\ninto the basilica, or court of justice, till the numbers were such that\r\nthe building would hold no more.\r\n\r\nA Roman basilica presented an appearance very similar to that of a\r\nmodern parish church, consisting as it did of a nave, and two aisles\r\ndivided from it by a row of columns. At one end a portion, elevated\r\nlike a daïs and railed off like a chancel, formed the _bema_ (the word\r\nhad passed from the Greek into the Syro-Chaldaic) or tribunal, where\r\nthe judges sat and orators pleaded. The whole of the interior was\r\nfurther surrounded by an upper gallery raised upon the columns that\r\ndivided the aisles. The ground floor and the galleries were for the\r\naccommodation of the public.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the bema, which was paved with tesselated marble,\r\nstood the governor’s curule chair, and on each side of it were rows of\r\nseats intended for the assessors, it being the custom for a provincial\r\ngovernor to be assisted in his judgments by a sort of informal council\r\nconsisting of distinguished citizens.\r\n\r\nShortly before noon there was a movement on the bema, caused by\r\nthe arrival of persons interested in the trial. Among them was the\r\npriest Theomantes, who, in virtue of his dignity as priest of Jupiter\r\nCæsarius, proceeded to ensconce himself in the seat immediately upon\r\nthe right of the curule chair, an act that caused murmurs among the\r\nJews and applause among the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nAnanias now entered, and seeing his own action anticipated, scowled,\r\nhesitated for a moment, and then deliberately sat down upon the lap of\r\nhis rival.\r\n\r\n“’Tis mine to sit upon the right of Florus,” he cried.\r\n\r\nThereupon, Theomantes, exerting all his strength, flung him off, amid\r\nmingled laughter and hooting from the two factions.\r\n\r\n“Even if the high priest of the Jews _had_ the right to this seat, it\r\nis not thine, seeing that thou art not high priest.”\r\n\r\nNow, it is not at all improbable that in their struggle for precedency\r\nthese two graybeards might have come to unseemly blows before a\r\ndelighted audience, but for the intervention of Terentius Rufus, who,\r\nwith a body of spearmen, was stationed in front of the tribunal for the\r\npurpose of preserving order among the spectators.\r\n\r\n“I never thought my services would be required upon the bema,” said he.\r\n\r\nAnd mounting the tribunal, he threatened unless Ananias settled down\r\nquietly in some other seat that he would remove him, as having wantonly\r\nand purposely created a disturbance in a court of justice.\r\n\r\n“Let Ananias possess his soul in patience,” he cried, “till it shall\r\nplease Florus to make known Cæsar’s decree on this matter.”\r\n\r\nThe humiliated Ananias made as if he would retire altogether from the\r\ncourt, but finally, thinking better of it, sat down upon the left-hand\r\nseat, just as Florus made his pompous entry.\r\n\r\nCrispus appeared about the same time, and, as being a distinguished\r\nvisitor, was assigned a place among the council.\r\n\r\nFlorus, having seated himself in his curule chair, demanded to know\r\nwhat business was set down for the day, and as it appeared that there\r\nwere many cases requiring his judicial decision, he announced that he\r\nwould begin with the trial of Simon.\r\n\r\nA thrill of excitement ran through the basilica when the order was\r\ngiven, “Go, lictors, bring hither Simon, surnamed the Black.”\r\n\r\nWithout delay the prisoner was brought.\r\n\r\nWalking between two guards, his hands tied behind his back with a cord\r\nwhose end was held by a third soldier, came the terrible Zealot, who\r\nhad hanged so many Romans that men had lost all count of the number. A\r\nman, tall and muscular, and having a singular breadth of chest, with\r\nblack hair, black eyes, and black beard. Clothed in the dress he wore\r\nwhen captured, a gabardine all slashed with sword-cuts, and black with\r\ndried blood; with face unwashed, and beard and hair long and unkempt,\r\nhe made a wild and savage figure. Captivity and darkness, chilling\r\ndamps and meager diet, had failed, however, to tame his spirit; he\r\nstood, dark, scowling, defiant, the living incarnation of enmity to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nFlorus, after a brief and (as it seemed to Crispus) uneasy glance at\r\nthe captive, turned to a table where sat the advocates, and asked:\r\n\r\n“Who conducts the prosecution?”\r\n\r\nTertullus arose.\r\n\r\n“Be brief. No oratory,” said the procurator.\r\n\r\nIn a Roman trial proceedings usually began with the questioning of\r\nthe accused in the endeavor to prove out of his own mouth the charge\r\nbrought against him. Should this procedure fail, or should the\r\nprisoner, through obstinacy, refuse to answer, it became necessary to\r\ncall upon witnesses.\r\n\r\nTertullus turned to question the captive, while the clerk of the court,\r\nwith lifted pen, sat ready to record the dialogue; for, be it known,\r\nthere were in that age scribes who, by a system of abbreviations, were\r\ncapable of writing as fast as a man could speak.\r\n\r\n“Your name?” began Tertullus.\r\n\r\n“You ask me my name?” said the Zealot with a laugh of scorn. “You ought\r\nto know, seeing what fear it has put into the hearts of you Romans. I\r\nam Simon, son of Giora, of the tribe of Benjamin.”\r\n\r\n“Your birthplace?”\r\n\r\n“Gerasa, beyond Jordan.”\r\n\r\n“Your calling?”\r\n\r\n“Slayer of the Romans.”\r\n\r\n“Consider! You desire the clerk to write down that answer?”\r\n\r\n“Let him write it twice, yea thrice, and in his largest characters.”\r\n\r\n“You confess, then, that you are of the sect known as the Zealots?”\r\n\r\n“A curse on your Gentile terms; I am of the sect of the Kenaïm.”\r\n\r\n“Zealots or Kenaïm, ’tis much the same. What are their tenets?”\r\n\r\n“These: call no one king but God; pay no tax save to the temple; slay\r\nevery Roman who presumes to exercise authority over the holy seed.”\r\n\r\n“‘Call no one king but God’? Then you do not acknowledge the authority\r\nof Cæsar?”\r\n\r\n“Cæsar!” It is impossible to describe the contempt with which he spoke\r\nthe name. “Cæsar! I spit at the name of Cæsar.”\r\n\r\nAnd he did, there and then, upon the pavement. This repudiation of\r\nimperial authority was received by the servile Græco-Syrian mob with a\r\nroar of execration.\r\n\r\n“_Læsa majestas!_” was their cry. “Fling him over the rails!”\r\n\r\n“‘Assassinate every Roman’?” continued Tertullus. “Then you would\r\nassassinate Florus, if you could?”\r\n\r\nThe very suggestion caused the face of the Zealot to mantle with\r\nferocious joy.\r\n\r\n“Place a dagger in my freed hands, set me within three paces of him,\r\nand you shall see.”\r\n\r\n“The court will take the will for the deed,” observed Tertullus dryly.\r\n“Attend to the indictment. You are charged with being the chief of a\r\nband of Zealots, or, if it please you, Kenaïm. Stationed among the\r\nheights in the Pass of Adummim, it was your wont to issue forth, and to\r\nrob and to hang every Roman that came that way.”\r\n\r\n“A marvel! A lawyer speaks the truth!”\r\n\r\n“How many Romans have been put to death by you?”\r\n\r\n“Put that question to the vultures. I kept no register of the slain.\r\nThus much I know, that, give me my freedom, and you shall see me repeat\r\nthe work with a new band.”\r\n\r\n“Traitor to the empire, do you glory in your guilt?”\r\n\r\n“The guilt is yours who presume to exercise authority in a land that\r\nGod sware with an oath should be ours forever. Out of this land, then,\r\nye Romans, with your legions and your lictors, your taxes and your\r\nidols! It is contrary to the will of God that Cæsar should bear rule in\r\nJudæa, and the Jew that acknowledges him breaks the law of Moses. For\r\nit is written therein, ‘One from among thy brethren shalt thou set king\r\nover thee; thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy\r\nbrother’; whereof let due note be taken by that smug Ananias there, who\r\nfraternizes so comfortably with his country’s enemies!”\r\n\r\n“As it was your custom,” continued Tertullus, “to plunder, as well as\r\nto kill, you doubtless gained considerable wealth?”\r\n\r\n“Wealth? Ay, stores of it,” said Simon, his eyes sparkling as if at the\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n“None was found in the place of your capture.”\r\n\r\nSimon laughed exultingly.\r\n\r\n“It exists, for all that, in a place where no Roman can lay hand upon\r\nit, reserved for the great day of vengeance.”\r\n\r\n“Or, in other words, it is to be used in fomenting war against Rome?”\r\n\r\n“Lawyer, thou hast said.”\r\n\r\n“It is rumored that several persons of high station have been in\r\ncommunication with you?”\r\n\r\n“The highest in the land. I can see now upon the bema here some of my\r\npast accomplices. Why are they not placed beside me to be judged?”\r\n\r\nThe uneasiness that had never been absent from the face of Florus\r\nseemed now to increase. It was noticed by Tertullus, who smiled to\r\nhimself with the quiet satisfaction of an archer who, after many\r\ntrials, has hit the mark at last.\r\n\r\nThe crowd of spectators, hitherto restless and murmuring, became\r\nsuddenly hushed. Florus’ long delay in bringing Simon to trial had\r\ngiven birth to sinister rumors as to the relations previously existing\r\nbetween the procurator and the robber-chief. Was the dark story about\r\nto be confirmed? With breathless interest they awaited the issue.\r\n\r\n“The court will be pleased at having these accomplices named,” said\r\nTertullus with affected carelessness.\r\n\r\n“I name them not, unless I have a promise that they shall be arrested\r\nwithout delay.”\r\n\r\n“The court will have no hesitation in arresting them, provided that you\r\ncan prove your charge.”\r\n\r\n“Good! If it be a crime to plot against the life of a Roman, bid the\r\nlictors go and bind the hands of Ananias.”\r\n\r\nTertullus’ face fell somewhat. Ananias was not the name he wanted.\r\n\r\n“Lying Zealot!” exclaimed the priest; and, forgetting for the moment\r\nthat it was not a Jewish court in which he could do according to his\r\nown pleasure, he cried, “Strike him on the mouth!”\r\n\r\n“O Ananias! Ananias!” said Simon, shaking his head with mock gravity,\r\n“were you not once an accomplice with me in a plot to slay a Roman\r\ncitizen? ’Tis clear you have forgotten my face: let me recall it to\r\nyou. Did there not once come to you--’tis eight years ago now--forty\r\nSicarii,[6] of whom I was one, offering to slay Paul of Tarsus, a Roman\r\ncitizen, mark you! and freeborn? Did you not readily join in the plot?\r\nAnd now do you disavow your old friend Simon? Nay, verily, be honest,\r\nand take your trial with me.”\r\n\r\nOver the face of Ananias there had suddenly crept a look scarcely\r\ncompatible with the idea of innocence.\r\n\r\n“Will no one stop the mouth of the lying knave?” he cried, trembling\r\nwith passion.\r\n\r\n“Your looks sufficiently show who is the lying knave,” answered Simon\r\ncoolly. “If ye desire proof of this, my accusation,” he continued,\r\naddressing the court, “send to Jerusalem for Paul’s nephew; he will\r\nconfirm what I say. Does the court agree that Ananias shall take\r\nhis trial with me?” added Simon, looking around him with a sardonic\r\nsmile. “No? And yet ’tis the fashion of Romans to boast of their\r\njustice!--justice, forsooth!”\r\n\r\n“Prisoner,” said Florus, “be not so free of tongue, and you may find\r\nthat our Roman justice, whose purity you seem to question, can be\r\ntempered with mercy.”\r\n\r\n“Now, let the court carefully mark that little speech,” said Simon\r\ncoolly, “for, being interpreted, it meaneth, ‘Keep quiet as to _my_\r\ndoings, O Simon, and I will endeavor to procure your release.’ But in\r\nvain do you offer me the bribe of life, O Florus, in order to stay my\r\ntongue. Welcome torture, scourgings, death, if I do but succeed in\r\nhurling you from power.”\r\n\r\nSimon was not to be appeased, and Florus, catching sight of Tertullus’\r\nsmile, suddenly realized the lawyer’s motive in pressing for the public\r\ntrial of the Zealot. It was to ruin him--Florus!\r\n\r\nIt was out of the question either to gag the prisoner or to declare\r\nthe court closed; either alternative would expose him to suspicion.\r\nHe, the judge, must sit and listen to an accusation, which, even if it\r\nwere untrue, would be greedily believed by nine out of every ten, so\r\nunpopular was he with the people over whom he ruled. And when the story\r\nshould reach Rome, as it undoubtedly would--his enemies would take good\r\ncare of that!--it might mean the loss, not only of his procuratorship,\r\nas Simon had said, but even of his life.\r\n\r\n“The brazen effrontery of this knave!” said he, assuming a stern\r\nbearing. “Knowing that his doom is certain, he seeks to delay sentence\r\nby vilifying the character of his judges. Go, lictors, bring hither the\r\nflagellum.”\r\n\r\n“And, when brought, apply it to the shoulders of the robber Florus,”\r\nsaid Simon.\r\n\r\n“Ye see for yourselves,” said Florus, turning to the assessors, “what\r\nan incorrigible villain this is!”\r\n\r\n“Listen to a story that is no fiction,” continued Simon. “Florus sent a\r\nsecret messenger offering me free license to plunder and slay Roman and\r\nGentile alike, on condition of his receiving half the spoil.”\r\n\r\n“A lie as black as Erebus!” thundered the procurator.\r\n\r\n“It is one thing to accuse, another thing to prove,” remarked Tertullus\r\nquietly, secretly delighted at the turn events were taking.\r\n\r\n“I have no proof in writing. Florus is too artful a fox to employ ink\r\nand parchment on such a matter. His intermediary in this business was\r\nhis freedman, Nymphidius.”\r\n\r\n“Is it worth while sending for this Nymphidius,” asked Tertullus of\r\nFlorus, “that he may deny this allegation?”\r\n\r\n“It is useless sending for him,” observed Rufus, “for he died this\r\nmorning--suddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Who helped him to die?” asked Simon. “For it appears to me that his\r\ndeath has occurred at a time very convenient for Florus.”\r\n\r\nA significant question, this! Men looked at each other, little doubting\r\nthat Florus had by foul means removed an awkward witness from his path.\r\n\r\n“Bear with me, noble Florus,” said Tertullus, “if I assume for a moment\r\nthe truth of this knave’s story. What answer,” he continued, addressing\r\nSimon, “what answer did you give to Nymphidius?”\r\n\r\n“This was my answer: ‘Tell the uncircumcized dog of a Florus that Simon\r\nwill plunder without asking _his_ leave. Let him send to Manahem, the\r\nson of Judas, who will doubtless be glad to purchase license on such\r\nterms.’”\r\n\r\nTertullus now dropped his mask and became, like Simon, an accuser of\r\nthe procurator.\r\n\r\n“It was this Manahem, O Florus,” said he quietly, “who a fortnight ago\r\nrobbed me of a myrrhine drinking-cup, which last night appeared upon\r\n_your_ table.”\r\n\r\nNow, during all this time Crispus had been listening with a strange\r\nconflict of emotions. Hatred of Simon’s crimes was mingled with\r\nadmiration for his daring spirit. He was also compelled to admit that\r\nthe existence of the Zealots was, to a certain extent, justified\r\nby Roman misgovernment, a fact very unpalatable for a patriot\r\nlike Crispus, ever striving to believe that Rome and justice were\r\nconvertible terms. From the rule of wicked and rapacious governors\r\nlike Pilate and Felix, Albinus and Florus, what other spirit could\r\ndevelop in Judæa but a burning hatred of Roman rule, combined with\r\na determination to throw off the yoke whenever a favorable occasion\r\nshould arise?\r\n\r\nThough Simon was doubtless deserving of death, yet nevertheless\r\nCrispus’ sense of justice revolted against his condemnation by judges\r\nlike Florus and Ananias, themselves guilty of malefactions. He resolved\r\nto disassociate himself from the council.\r\n\r\n“Since the prisoner,” said he, “questions the integrity of two of his\r\njudges, and, as it seems to me, with some show of reason, I herewith\r\ndecline to take any further part in this trial.”\r\n\r\nSuiting the action to the word, Crispus rose from his seat and withdrew\r\nfrom the bema.\r\n\r\n“And I do the like,” said Theomantes, moved in his action mainly by his\r\nfeud with Ananias.\r\n\r\n“And I!”--“And I!” exclaimed several other members, rising and\r\ndescending from the tribunal.\r\n\r\nFlorus sat, full of impotent rage, on perceiving that the statements of\r\nSimon and Tertullus were believed in, not only by the common people,\r\nbut also by the majority of the council.\r\n\r\n“The trial is adjourned,” he cried. “Let the prisoner be carried back\r\nto his dungeon.”\r\n\r\nThe command came too late. Simon had perceived among the Jewish portion\r\nof the spectators certain disguised Zealots, who, both by eye and by\r\ngesture, were secretly inviting him to make a dash for liberty.\r\n\r\nActing on the hint, he suddenly wrenched himself free from his guards,\r\ndarted to the edge of the tribunal, and, taking a flying leap over the\r\nline of soldiers that guarded its front, he alighted among his friends,\r\nwho, struggling desperately, began to push him towards the open doors\r\nof the basilica.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, attempting to follow, were at once opposed, not only\r\nby the whole Jewish body, but also by the Græco-Syrians, who in this\r\nmatter were actuated not out of any love for Simon, but from a desire\r\nto thwart and disappoint Florus, whose rule was hateful to them. The\r\ncourt of justice became immediately transformed into a wild tumultuous\r\npandemonium.\r\n\r\n“Down with the wicked Florus!”\r\n\r\n“Death to old Ananias!”\r\n\r\nStones and other missiles, discharged by men of both factions, now came\r\nwhirling into the tribunal. Ananias, gathering his robe about him, fled\r\nto a place of safety. Florus, as he was lifting his hand in the futile\r\nattempt to quell the tumult, received a sharp-edged flint upon his\r\ntemples. Down his quickly-paling face flowed a stream of blood, a sight\r\nwelcomed by both factions with a huge roar of delight.\r\n\r\n“Guards, hither to me!” cried the alarmed procurator.\r\n\r\nFour stout soldiers sprang forward and screened him with their\r\nbucklers, that rattled again and again to the pelting shower of\r\nstones as the procurator, following the example of Ananias, fled amid\r\nhootings, cursings, and derisive laughter.\r\n\r\nAt the command of Rufus the soldiers, by threatening the people with\r\nleveled spears, soon cleared the courthouse. They failed, however, to\r\nrecover Simon, who, dragged off by his friends, contrived to make good\r\nhis escape.\r\n\r\n“He’ll harass us again,” grumbled Rufus, a prophecy destined to meet\r\nwith ample verification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       “DELENDA EST HIEROSOLYMA!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Then you will not marry me, princess?”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words addressed by Florus to Berenice, as he walked\r\nbeside her in the sunlit gardens of the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nThe ugly gash he had received that morning from the well-aimed missile\r\nhad not enhanced his personal beauty. Berenice, as she watched him\r\nfrom beneath the fringe of her dark, silky eyelashes, shivered, and\r\nthought how like a satyr he looked! She mentally contrasted the\r\nbloated coarseness of his visage with Crispus’ clear bronzed healthful\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n“Marry _you_!” she said, emphasizing the last word. “My lord Florus,\r\nyou have a wife already!”\r\n\r\n“So had my predecessor Felix, but that did not prevent your sister\r\nDrusilla from marrying him.”\r\n\r\n“Poor deluded Drusilla! she would never have so acted but for the\r\nspells and sorceries of Simon Magus.”\r\n\r\n“Would that I knew where this Simon were to be found,” sighed the\r\ngovernor, “for then would I, too, employ him in the like office!”\r\n\r\n“You have the great Theomantes,” laughed Berenice. “Cannot he weave\r\nspells for you? or has he already done so, and failed? But, my lord\r\nFlorus, have pity on your wife. Why do you desire wicked Berenice in\r\nplace of the good Cleopatra?”\r\n\r\n“Fairest of women,” began the governor gallantly.\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said the princess, somewhat darkly, “Crispus hath openly\r\ndeprived me of that title.”\r\n\r\n“A fool, who hath no eyes for real beauty.”\r\n\r\n“Is it Berenice the Fair or Berenice the Golden that you are seeking to\r\nwoo?”\r\n\r\n“Mine,” answered Florus with a fine air of virtue, “mine is not a\r\nmercenary character.”\r\n\r\n“Except where the spoil of Zealots is concerned,” laughed Berenice. “I\r\nfear greatly that this morning’s revelation will deprive you of office.”\r\n\r\nThe procurator, too, was very much of this opinion, but it was not\r\npleasant to hear it from her. Masking his anger beneath a hollow smile,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n“To gain you, princess, I would--yes! I would willingly turn proselyte,\r\nand that is more than Felix did for Drusilla.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a tempting offer,” said Berenice, with a sweet mocking laugh that\r\ncharmed while it maddened the procurator. “How the Jews would joy in\r\ntheir new convert! Picture me leading Florus by the hand to the temple,\r\nthere to present him to Matthias as a pious neophyte!” Then, becoming\r\ngrave again, she went on, “My father Agrippa was king of Judæa, and it\r\nhas ever been my aim to control the destinies of this same land, an aim\r\nforedoomed to failure were I to marry you.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“O dullard! You have ruled because your wife was the friend of the\r\nEmpress Poppæa.” (“_Was?_” thought Florus, wondering why she should\r\nuse the past tense; he was soon to learn!) “Had you divorced Cleopatra\r\nto marry me you would have set the empress against you, and then where\r\nwould have been your procuratorship?”\r\n\r\nThis view of the case had often occurred to Florus himself. Still, what\r\nwas the loss of his office compared with the handling of Berenice’s\r\ngold?\r\n\r\n“And,” continued Berenice, “even supposing that the empress,\r\noverlooking the slight to her friend Cleopatra, should be willing to\r\nmaintain you in office, she can no longer do so, seeing that she is\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n“Poppæa dead?” gasped Florus incredulously.\r\n\r\n“So saith my freedman Sadas.”\r\n\r\n“Whence did he learn it?”\r\n\r\n“A ship from Rome has just arrived in harbor with the tidings.\r\nEverybody on board is talking about it. Our greatest proselyte is dead,\r\nkilled by a blow from Nero’s foot, and she with child! Kicked to death\r\nby him whom you would have had us worship last night as a god,” she\r\nadded, her lip wreathing in scorn.\r\n\r\nFlorus was thunderstruck at the tidings, foreseeing a quick end to\r\nhis rule now that there was no Poppæa to stand between him and the\r\npunishment justly due for his misdeeds. He knew full well that as\r\nsoon as the Jews received the news they would send to Rome an embassy\r\npraying for his removal. They would certainly mention that little deal\r\nwith the Zealots, not to speak of various other little peccadillos.\r\n\r\n“And in ceasing to be procurator,” said he, wrathfully, “I, of course,\r\ncease to be of interest to you?”\r\n\r\n“Unless you should become Cæsar, in which case send for me, and I will\r\ncome to you--yea, fly! As empress of the world I could do the holy\r\nnation better service than as queen of Judæa.”\r\n\r\nEmpress of the world! She spoke lightly, little dreaming how narrowly\r\nshe was to miss gaining the imperial throne.\r\n\r\n“You think only of your people, and of your superstition,” muttered\r\nFlorus.\r\n\r\n“Only of my people, and of my--superstition. You have hit off my\r\ncharacter.”\r\n\r\n“You have been playing with me for your own ends,” said he, his great\r\ncoarse cheek reddening with anger. “And now you cast me off as one\r\ncasts off a sandal that has outlived its use.”\r\n\r\n“O Florus, have done!” she said with a wearied air. “We have both\r\nbeen acting. Let us drop the mask. ’Tis not Berenice herself that is\r\nthe charm, but her gold with which you hope to cancel past debts and\r\nto continue your infamous orgies. And I, divining your motives, have\r\nlikewise played the hypocrite, feigning a love I never felt, if by so\r\ndoing I might benefit Judæa. Strangely have you mistaken my nature in\r\nthinking that, apart from your procuratorship, you could ever have held\r\nany interest for me. My lord Florus, I bid you farewell.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that she left him.\r\n\r\nThe face of Florus was as the face of a demon as he watched her walking\r\nscornfully away with never a backward glance of pity or remorse. Love\r\nfor her had now altogether vanished from his heart; no other feeling\r\nthere but a big black hatred that transformed him to the elemental\r\nsavage. His only thought now was to revenge himself upon her. But how?\r\nDeath? It were a somewhat difficult matter to compass the end of a\r\nJewish princess. True, he might hire the daggers of the Sicarii, even\r\nas the procurator Felix had hired them to assassinate the high priest\r\nJonathan--he fell at the very altar--but suspicion would attach itself\r\nto him, and this was a thing to be avoided, if possible.\r\n\r\nBesides, a death like that were too light a punishment; one sharp\r\npang, and all would be over. His vengeance must take a more subtle, a\r\nmore protracted form. How to accomplish it was the question, and thus\r\nthinking, he walked meditatively back to the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nOn entering, he learned that King Polemo--Berenice’s ex-husband--was\r\nawaiting an interview with him in the Ivory Hall, a saloon so called\r\nfrom its paneling.\r\n\r\nFlorus received the news with something like a frown.\r\n\r\n“What wants he with me?” he muttered, darkly. “’Tis he who has brought\r\nme to this.” But in a moment his face cleared again. “A friend of\r\nCæsar! Ha! he may be of help to me in this crisis,” and he accordingly\r\ndirected his steps to the Ivory Hall.\r\n\r\n“Bring wine,” commanded he; and this being done, Florus was left alone\r\nwith his visitor.\r\n\r\nThe friendship--if, indeed, it deserved the name--existing between the\r\ntwo men, had begun a year previously at Rome at the time when Florus\r\nwas about to proceed to Judæa in the character of procurator. The\r\nking’s sudden attachment was a fact somewhat puzzling to Florus, who,\r\nhowever highly he might think of himself, was nevertheless secretly\r\nconscious that his character was not such as to appeal to a man of\r\nPolemo’s stamp. However, there the fact was: Polemo was evidently\r\nanxious to ingratiate himself into Florus’ good will, for, finding\r\nthat the Roman was ill-provided with money, he supplied him with a sum\r\nsufficient to enable the new procurator to make a splendid entry into\r\nCæsarea. Since that time Florus had received additional sums from the\r\nking. Never was there a more willing and a more charming lender than\r\nPolemo. Content with receiving written acknowledgments of the amount,\r\nhe did not press for repayment. Let not Florus disturb himself; he\r\ncould pay at his leisure. Delighted at this easy way of obtaining\r\nmoney, Florus had, in the course of one short year, recklessly borrowed\r\nagain and again, till in his more sober moments he trembled to think\r\nhow great was his debt. If suddenly called upon to refund the whole at\r\nonce, he would be a ruined man.\r\n\r\nOf late Florus had grown very uneasy; the suspicion, nay, the certainty\r\nseized him that the king was trying to establish a sinister hold over\r\nhim. There was in Polemo’s grave air and peculiar smile something that\r\nseemed to say, “What I bid you do, you will do!” And Florus, feeling\r\nhimself chained hand and foot, durst not resent the other’s quiet\r\nair of mastership, for these were the days, be it observed, when the\r\nRoman law ordained that, whatever his rank (unless he belonged to the\r\nimperial family, who, of course, were above all law) the debtor unable\r\nto meet his liabilities must become the bond-slave of his creditor.\r\n\r\nThat Polemo had some end in view was certain, but what it could be,\r\nFlorus had, so far, not the least inkling.\r\n\r\nOne fact, however, became increasingly clear. Polemo, who in days gone\r\nby had submitted to the rite of circumcision in order to gain the hand\r\nof Berenice, had now no love either for Judaism or the Jews, and spoke\r\nof the latter in terms of scorn and hatred.\r\n\r\nFlorus, disposed by nature to be harsh in dealing with the people\r\nunder his rule, seemed to receive a tacit if not direct encouragement\r\nfrom Polemo; at any rate, he never left the king’s presence without\r\na determination to adopt new methods of repression, even though by\r\nso doing he should run the risk of losing the favor of Berenice. It\r\nseemed almost as if Polemo had set himself to counteract her influence;\r\nand in truth Florus, swayed first by one and then by the other, had\r\nvacillated strangely between right-doing and wrong-doing. His own\r\nnatural disposition, however, inclined him to follow the sinister\r\nsuggestions of Polemo, to such an extent as to make his procuratorship\r\nmore infamous in character than any that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nFlorus had often wondered what was the attitude of Polemo’s mind\r\ntowards Berenice, but on this point he could never quite satisfy\r\nhimself. When he had ventured, not without some diffidence, to intimate\r\nhis intention of wooing the king’s one-time wife, Polemo smiled,\r\nbidding him succeed--if he could! And after that, whenever the two met,\r\nPolemo never failed to inquire, not without a suggestion of sarcasm,\r\nhow the other’s suit was progressing.\r\n\r\nHe did the like on the present occasion.\r\n\r\n“May her own Jewish devil, whom they call Satan, carry her off to\r\nTartarus,” was Florus’ elegant rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“Ah! stands the case so? I thought ’twould have that ending. ’Twere\r\nunwomanly of her to accept the love of a man already wedded, especially\r\nas she herself----”\r\n\r\nFlorus wondered what was coming next, but Polemo had checked himself as\r\nif about to say too much.\r\n\r\n“I came not, however, to talk of Berenice,” he continued, “but of your\r\nown desperate position.”\r\n\r\n“A position for which you are in some measure responsible,” said Florus.\r\n\r\n“Nay, this secret league with robber Zealots is a folly all your own. I\r\nhave advocated severity, but unfortunately your severities have never\r\ngone far enough for my purpose.”\r\n\r\n_His_ purpose? thought Florus. Did he think, then, to govern Judæa\r\nthrough him? It would seem so.\r\n\r\n“Your shafts have galled the animal merely without causing him to turn\r\nand fight.”\r\n\r\n“Be plainer with me.”\r\n\r\n“My desire has been to see the Jews rise in revolt by reason of the\r\nharshness of your administration. Your timid leniency has foiled my\r\naim. The Jews have _not_ risen.”\r\n\r\nFlorus grew secretly angry to think that he had been a tool alternately\r\nto Polemo and Berenice, the more so as he had succeeded in giving\r\nsatisfaction to neither.\r\n\r\n“’Twere better to carry out my policy. To goad the Jews into rebellion\r\nis now your only hope of salvation. Your harsh dealing in the past will\r\nthen have some justification. You can plead that the character of the\r\npeople forced you against your will to be severe. Repressive measures\r\nare required by a people always on the verge of breaking out into war.\r\nTheir revolt at this juncture will serve as a cloak to cover your\r\nformer misdeeds.”\r\n\r\nNow, while Polemo was speaking thus, a new feeling came over Florus. He\r\nfound his anger giving place to a tingling sensation of pleasure, as\r\nhe recalled Berenice’s words that she cared for nothing but her people\r\nand her religion. Here in the suggestion of Polemo was the opportunity\r\nof striking at her through these twin idols of her affection. Among all\r\nhis schemes for hurting Berenice he had not thought of this. The very\r\nthing! What a splendid vengeance it would be if he could successfully\r\ngoad the Jews into war, and then utilize that war as a means for\r\ndestroying both nation and temple!\r\n\r\nThere have been monsters in history; Florus was one of them. His\r\nmalevolence could contemplate with equanimity the extermination of a\r\nwhole people provided only that he could hurt Berenice by the action;\r\nand if the groan of every dying victim should send an additional\r\ntorture to her heart, why then, the more that died the better!\r\n\r\nBut, as he fell to reflecting, his ardor cooled somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was all very fine, but, in spite of Polemo’s opinion to the\r\ncontrary, seemed likely to recoil upon his own head. How could the\r\ngovernor that had purposely provoked a war hope to escape punishment at\r\nthe hands of Cæsar? He put the question to Polemo, who received it with\r\nsecret satisfaction, perceiving that Florus was quite willing to do the\r\nwork, if only he could emerge from it with safety.\r\n\r\n“Fear not. Having performed your task, you disappear for a time. My\r\nkingdom of Pontus shall afford you a safe asylum till the counselors\r\nwho surround Nero shall have persuaded him that you have in reality\r\ndone a good work.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! will they be able to do so?” asked Florus, dubiously.\r\n\r\n“They will,” answered Polemo. “Am I not the friend of Cæsar,” he\r\ncontinued, exhibiting the ring whose stone was engraved with Nero’s\r\nportrait, “entitled to stand at his right hand. I will show him that\r\nyou are a keen patriot; that all your outrages so called, even your\r\nalliance with the Zealots, have been but the development of a profound\r\nand subtle policy, all directed towards one aim only--the good of Rome.”\r\n\r\nFlorus, whose actions were never directed by anything but his own\r\nself-interest, grinned at the notion of being taken for a patriot.\r\n\r\n“The Jewish superstition,” continued Polemo, “is spreading, not only\r\namong other nations, but also among the Romans themselves. The captive\r\nis taking captive the conqueror. The Roman Senate sees in this wide\r\ndiffusion of Judaism a menace to the safety of the empire. How is it\r\nto be stopped? There is but one way: destroy the temple at Jerusalem,\r\nand you destroy the superstition. And since war is the only means of\r\naccomplishing this end, Roman statesmen would be grateful to Florus\r\nfor initiating the war. Why should we show a false mercy to the Jew?\r\nConsider Rome’s past policy towards him, and the return he makes for it.\r\n\r\n“Rome does not seek, nor even wish, to impose her own gods upon any\r\nof the subject nations. But how different is the case with the Jew,\r\nwho compasses sea and land to make one proselyte, and in the person of\r\nPoppæa has all but captured the imperial throne itself. Not a city of\r\nthe empire but has its synagogue, though, forsooth, the Jew will not\r\npermit a single Gentile temple to be erected on the so-called holy soil\r\nof his own land--nay, would fly to arms should the thing be attempted.\r\n\r\n“This people are seeking to Judaize the empire, and should this\r\nproselytism continue at its present rate of progress, Rome is doomed.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” asked the startled Florus.\r\n\r\n“Because mankind, when Judaized, will turn, not to Rome, but to\r\nJerusalem, as the capital of the world, and the seat of ideas. The\r\nhigh priest, and not Cæsar, will wield the scepter of empire; and,\r\nsince toleration is unknown to the Jew, Oriental barbarism will triumph\r\nover Western civilization. Three times a year shall we be compelled to\r\nappear at Jerusalem. The laws of the Twelve Tables will give place to\r\nthe precepts of the rabbis. Homer will be burnt in the market square;\r\nthe philosophy of Plato superseded by the Pentateuch of Moses. Our\r\ncircus games, Olympian contests, and theatrical plays will cease.\r\nSculpture will be forbidden; the fairest masterpieces of Phidias will\r\nperish beneath the hammer of fanatics. The beautiful temples of Greece\r\nwill be given over to the flames--there must be but one temple only,\r\nthat of the jealous Hebrew God. All that gives to life brightness, and\r\nbeauty, and joy, will vanish forever from the world, and we must find\r\nour chief pleasure in circumcision and the synagogue, in fastings and\r\nSabbaths.”\r\n\r\n“By the gods, Polemo, you frighten me!” exclaimed Florus, contemplating\r\nwith dismay this picture of a Judaized world.\r\n\r\n“I trust I do, for then you will the more readily carry out my designs\r\nagainst the hateful race of fanatics, who will do all I have said,\r\nif they be not checked. The existence of the Jew and his proselyte\r\nought not to be tolerated by the Roman; their very creed teaches them\r\ndisloyalty.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“How is the power of Rome maintained? Only by its army. Abolish the\r\nlegions, and how long, think you, would it be before the Northern\r\nbarbarians would come pouring over the Rhine and the Danube bent on our\r\noverthrow? What part do the Jew and his proselyte take in our common\r\ndefense? None! Let a Roman subject become a disciple of the synagogue,\r\nand though called upon, he obstinately refuses to serve in the army,\r\non the plea that he may have to march or to fight on the Sabbath day,\r\na thing forbidden by his religion. Rome has had to yield to them,\r\nand hence the unwritten law exempting Jews and their proselytes from\r\nmilitary impressment. The Gaul and the Greek, the Spaniard and the\r\nEgyptian, must be told off to defend the empire: you and I, dear\r\nFlorus, must shed our blood, in order, forsooth, that the Jew may have\r\nleisure to trade upon us, and grow rich.”\r\n\r\n“A piece of injustice, the very thought of which makes one savage,”\r\ncommented Florus.\r\n\r\n“The Jew is _in_ the empire, but not _of_ it; he enjoys its advantages,\r\nbut refuses to pay for them. The wealth made by him in huckstering is\r\nnot employed to benefit the province where earned, but is sent to the\r\ntemple at Jerusalem, there to lie dormant. The drain of gold and silver\r\nto the temple is so serious a matter as to have affected at times the\r\ncurrency of a province, compelling its governor to forbid the export.[7]\r\n\r\n“Why this piling up in the temple of treasure, amounting to millions of\r\naurei? Why? Because war cannot be carried on without gold. This hoard,\r\nwhich the Jews would have us regard as merely the religious offerings\r\nof pious souls, is in reality being accumulated for the purpose of\r\nwaging war against Rome.”\r\n\r\n“I have often thought so myself,” said Florus, who had never thought\r\nanything of the kind.\r\n\r\n“You heard Simon the Zealot say that he had put his gold where no Roman\r\ncould touch it; what place did he mean if not the sanctuary of the\r\ntemple?--a sanctuary to which even Cæsar himself is denied access. I\r\nwarrant that the escaped Zealot will find asylum there, for before he\r\ntook to the mountains he was known to be the friend of Eleazar, the\r\ncaptain of the temple, an officer whom you know to be outspoken in his\r\nhatred of Rome. But to return from individuals to the nation. When they\r\ndeem the occasion ripe, they will of themselves declare war, a war\r\ncertain to begin at the passover time; for, on the pretext of coming\r\nup to the feast, the Jews and their proselytes can be conveniently\r\nsummoned from every quarter of the empire. Rome hath never liked these\r\ngatherings, and with reason. Their numbers grow year by year: at the\r\nlast passover the pilgrims swelled the population of Jerusalem to the\r\nnumber of three hundred myriads. Ye gods! Think of it! Three million\r\nfanatics all burning with a hatred of Rome allowed to assemble in\r\na city, said to be the strongest in the world! What can the Senate\r\nbe thinking of? Why should we wait till this nation be grown more\r\npowerful? Even now there are rumors of alliances with nations outside\r\nthe borders of the empire--with Parthians beyond the Euphrates, and\r\nwith the Arabs of the desert. Every year increases _their_ strength,\r\nand _our_ peril. But let their city and their temple be given to\r\nthe flames--which is what must happen in the event of war--and\r\ntheir religion comes to an end; the day of proselytism is over; the\r\npilgrimages cease, for who will have faith in a deity powerless to\r\nprotect his temple? ‘The gods of Rome,’ ’twill be said, ‘are more\r\npotent than he of Judæa.’ Judaism once destroyed, the empire is safe.\r\nIt is in your power, Florus, to do this, and I----”\r\n\r\n“_Satis!_” cried the procurator. “You have said enough to convince me\r\nthat the destroying of this nation is a patriotic and righteous deed.”\r\n\r\nBut Polemo had still another argument left, more powerful than any\r\nother. He had purposely kept it to the last.\r\n\r\nHe drew forth a small roll of parchment notes, which Florus recognized\r\nas his own monetary acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n“On the day that the Jews declare war, I shall burn these without\r\nasking for repayment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                        THE JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first rays of morning sunlight were gilding the stately towers\r\nof Cæsarea as the soldiers of the Italian Cohort filed through the\r\nsouthern gate of the city.\r\n\r\nThey were marching on foot to Jerusalem, a journey of some sixty miles,\r\nmarching by the military road made by the Romans themselves, a highway\r\nso well and durably paved that portions of it still remain after the\r\nlapse of nearly two thousand years.\r\n\r\nA little in advance of these troops, and justly proud of their fine and\r\nmartial appearance, rode the tribune Terentius Rufus, and at his side\r\nwas Crispus, mounted likewise upon a curveting steed.\r\n\r\nOn the previous day Nero’s edict had been posted up in the public\r\nplaces of Cæsarea; it gave the precedency to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nNow, though it was plain to the least observant that the city was\r\nseething with excitement caused by the triumph of the one faction and\r\nthe mortification of the other, Rufus and his cohort had been commanded\r\nby the procurator to return to Jerusalem on the ground that all was\r\nquiet at Cæsarea!\r\n\r\n“And Florus himself,” remarked Rufus, “is withdrawing to Sebaste with\r\nhis legion, so that the city will be entirely denuded of troops. Pluto\r\ntake me!” he continued, knitting his brows in perplexity, “if I can\r\nunderstand his conduct save upon the supposition that he wants to\r\nkindle the torch of war.”\r\n\r\nThe two rode on in silence for a while. Then Crispus, who from time\r\nto time had been glancing back at the marching troops, said, with a\r\nsomewhat perplexed air:\r\n\r\n“Rufus, there is something lacking in thy cohort. What is it? Ah! I\r\nhave it. The eagle! Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“Purposely left behind in the Prætorium at Cæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“Name of Mars!--why?”\r\n\r\n“In going through Judæa we have to pay respect to the Jewish\r\nsuperstition, which, as you know, regards all images with abhorrence.”\r\n\r\nCrispus was for the moment dumb with indignation.\r\n\r\n“What!” cried he. “We must not carry our standards in a country\r\nconquered by us? Doth Rome rule Judæa, or Judæa Rome?”\r\n\r\n“Judæa doth, in this matter at least, rule Rome.”\r\n\r\n“I pray you, Rufus,” said Crispus, reining in his steed, “bid a\r\ncenturion return for the eagle.”\r\n\r\nBut Rufus shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Pontius Pilate was of like mind with you. He made his first entry\r\ninto Jerusalem with figured banners. For three days and two nights the\r\nJewish populace howled, raged, and wept round his Prætorium. At the end\r\nof the third day he sent his troops among them with drawn swords. The\r\nJews flung themselves prostrate, bared their necks, and cried that they\r\nwould rather die than see their laws broken.\r\n\r\n“What could dismayed Pilate do? He couldn’t massacre a whole people in\r\nthe first week of his government. Compelled sullenly to yield, he sent\r\nthe ensigns back to Cæsarea. Since that day no troops dare venture into\r\nJerusalem save with plain banners.”\r\n\r\n“Forbidden to carry the eagles,” muttered Crispus wrathfully. “How long\r\nshall this be?”\r\n\r\n“Till our next war with them, when we shall more thoroughly vindicate\r\nthe supremacy of Rome, and be masters in our own house.”\r\n\r\n“When will that be?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis but a matter of days, in my opinion.”\r\n\r\nDays! To Crispus this was startling news, and yet not unwelcome.\r\n\r\n“I carry with me a sealed letter,” continued Rufus, “addressed to King\r\nAgrippa, who is at Jerusalem. He is, as you know, the brother of the\r\nPrincess Berenice, the nominator of the high priest, and the supreme\r\nguardian of the temple treasures. The purport of the letter I know\r\nnot, but if I may judge from Florus’ sinister smile as he handed me\r\nthe missive, it contains some command which Agrippa will be loth to\r\nexecute. Should the Jews of Jerusalem support the king in his attitude,\r\nit may prove the beginning of an outbreak whose end no man can foresee.\r\nI may be wrong, Crispus, but I have a presentiment that in this letter\r\nwe are carrying the fate of Judæa.”\r\n\r\nCrispus frowned. He loved fighting, but it seemed to him there would be\r\nlittle honor and glory gained in reducing to submission a people goaded\r\nto war by the deliberate oppression of an unjust governor.\r\n\r\nThe road traversed by the Romans wound southwards through the\r\nflower-enameled meads that constitute the Plain of Sharon, never more\r\nlovely than when seen in the soft sunshine of a May morning.\r\n\r\nNow and again in their march the Romans would pass a gayly-clad group\r\nof Jewish country-folk, many of them accompanied by asses and mules,\r\nladen with timber.\r\n\r\n“Pilgrims bound for Jerusalem,” explained Rufus in answer to Crispus’\r\ninquiries. “Within a few days comes the Festival of the Xylophoria, or\r\nthe Wood-offering, when the Jews are accustomed to bring to the temple\r\nsupplies of timber sufficient to keep the sacrificial fires going for a\r\nyear.”\r\n\r\nAt a wayside spring a somewhat numerous caravan had made a brief halt\r\nto refill their water-skins, and to refresh their beasts of burden. The\r\nair was lively with the sound of timbrels, of songs, and of dances.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the clanging cohort, with its swinging martial stride,\r\nput a sudden stop to the mirth.\r\n\r\n“The Romans! the Romans!” was the cry.\r\n\r\nSilent of tongue, but with eyes that looked unmistakable hatred, the\r\npilgrims drew aside to let the legionaries pass. One fierce-looking\r\nJew, bolder than his fellows, cried aloud: “To Gehenna with all\r\nGentiles!”\r\n\r\nRufus rode past with a smile of contempt.\r\n\r\n“Yon fellow knows full well,” said he, “that if I choose, I can hang\r\nhim to the nearest tree, and yet the knowledge of that fact cannot keep\r\nhim from expressing his hatred of the Romans.”\r\n\r\n“What is the Gehenna to which he would consign us?” asked Crispus, who\r\nwas not so well versed in Hebrew matters as Rufus.\r\n\r\n“The Jewish Tartarus, a place of flame and torment, to which you and\r\nI, no matter how virtuous our life, are destined to be sent, according\r\nto the saying of the rabbis, ‘The Gentiles are only so much fuel for\r\nGehenna.’”\r\n\r\n“They don’t love us, these Jews,” laughed Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Hatred of the Roman is drawn in with the maternal milk. You see now\r\nthe necessity for maintaining so large a military force in Judæa.\r\nAfrica, once the seat of the Carthaginian empire, is kept in order\r\nby a single legion. One legion, too, suffices for warlike Spain.\r\nGreece, once so great in deeds of arms, hath no legion at all within\r\nher bounds. These turbulent Jews require three legions. Think of it!\r\nThirty-six thousand men perpetually under arms in a province no larger\r\nthan our native Latium, so restless are these Jews, so hostile to our\r\nrule.”\r\n\r\n“Why that stoppage in front?” said Crispus, glancing ahead at a group\r\nof distant pilgrims who had come to a sudden standstill in a way that\r\nthreatened to impede the march of the oncoming Romans.\r\n\r\n“That,” replied Rufus, “is another proof of Jewish contempt for the\r\nforeigner. The stone you see by the roadside marks the border of two\r\nprovinces. At present we are in heathen Phœnicia; pass that stone, and\r\nwe are in holy Judæa. Your Hebrew, on arriving at the frontier, takes\r\noff his sandals and carefully wipes them, lest he should pollute the\r\nsacred soil of Judæa by bringing upon it the profane dust of other\r\nlands.”\r\n\r\nCrispus looked, and saw that it was even as Rufus had said. Every Jew,\r\nupon coming to the frontier-stone, removed his shoes, and either wiped\r\nor shook them, a somewhat useless cleansing, seeing that a minute\r\nafterwards the six hundred men of the Italian Cohort were bringing in\r\nPhœnician dust with them.\r\n\r\n“You are a patrician of Rome,” said Rufus, addressing Crispus, “proud\r\nof your pure and lofty lineage, but know this, that if the vilest\r\nbeggar in Jerusalem should be touched by you on the eve of the passover\r\nhe would deem himself so unclean as to be unable to keep the feast.\r\nPurification by bathing would entitle him to the privilege of the\r\nsupplementary passover held seven days later to meet such cases.”\r\n\r\nA march of some twenty-five miles brought the cohort to Antipatris, a\r\nmilitary station guarding the line of communication between Cæsarea\r\nand Jerusalem. Within the barracks of this town Rufus found ample\r\naccommodation for his troops. At nightfall he and Crispus ascended to\r\nthe battlements of the Roman castle; from their lofty position the two\r\ncould see the whole extent of Sharon, from the mountains to the sea,\r\nwhitened by the silvery moonlight.\r\n\r\nFar and wide over the landscape gleamed the fires of the Jewish\r\npilgrims, camping for the night under the leafy terebinth or by the\r\nwayside spring.\r\n\r\n“List!” said Rufus, with uplifted finger.\r\n\r\nFloating upward from the valley below came the sound of many voices\r\nconjoined in a mournful melody. Now and again Crispus could faintly\r\ncatch some of the words of the refrain.\r\n\r\n“If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning!”\r\n\r\nAs the breeze wavered, the voices rose and fell with a weird and\r\nplaintive effect, and Crispus thrilled as he listened. There was, to\r\nhis way of thinking, a sob in every cadence--“How long, O Lord, how\r\nlong?”--a wild appeal to heaven for vengeance against their present\r\noppressor, the Roman.\r\n\r\nA spirit of profound melancholy fell upon Crispus as he contemplated\r\nthe character of this strange Eastern nation. In his journey that day\r\nevery face seen by him, every incident that had happened, gave proof\r\nthat though Jew and Roman touched each other at a hundred points, they\r\nwere nevertheless as far apart as if seas rolled between them.\r\n\r\nWhile all other nations of the empire, including even Greece, so\r\nrenowned in arts, arms, and learning, were content to live peaceably,\r\nnay happily under the shadow of the eagle-wings of Rome, the Jew\r\nmaintained an attitude of sullen hostility to his conqueror.\r\n\r\nHow long was this antagonism to last? Was the Jew to remain forever a\r\nthorn in the side of the empire, or must the solution of the problem\r\ncome, as Rufus was convinced it would, in the shape of an exterminating\r\nwar?\r\n\r\nNext morning at sunrise the march was resumed. The road, that had\r\nhitherto followed a line parallel with the coast, now turned inland,\r\nand leaving the maritime plain behind them, the Romans began to ascend\r\nthe picturesque ravines that wind towards the rocky tableland upon\r\nwhich Jerusalem is built.\r\n\r\nGophna, another military station, fifteen miles distant from the holy\r\ncity, was their second stopping-place.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak they began the third and final stage of their journey,\r\nalong a road dazzlingly white and dusty.\r\n\r\nAt the ninth hour of the morning the cohort was toiling through an\r\nupland ravine. In front of them at some distance was a numerous body\r\nof wood-bearing pilgrims. Suddenly, as their van gained the highest\r\npoint of the road, a thrilling shout broke from it, followed by a\r\nprecipitate hurrying forward on the part of all of those in the rear.\r\n\r\n“Yerûshalaïm! Yerûshalaïm!” was the cry that rang out on the morning\r\nair, the cry of the Jews.\r\n\r\n“Hagiopolis! Hagiopolis!” exclaimed the Greek proselytes.\r\n\r\n“Hierosolyma!” said Rufus quietly.\r\n\r\nImpelled by a natural curiosity, Crispus pressed forward his steed,\r\nand, as he gained the northern height of Scopus, the whole city at one\r\nflash burst full upon his view.\r\n\r\nHe drew rein, and, with a lively interest, gazed upon the famous\r\ncity--“_longe clarissima urbium Orientis_”--whose origin was lost far\r\nback in the night of antiquity, a city gray with age ere ever a stone\r\nof Rome was laid!\r\n\r\nA century earlier Jerusalem had presented a dull and even squalid\r\nappearance; but, thanks to that magnificent despot, Herod the Great, a\r\nmonarch distinguished by his taste for Grecian architecture, the city\r\nwas now a dream of beauty, with its imperial mantle of proud towers;\r\nits marble palaces gleaming through the clear, transparent air of a\r\nSyrian morn; its stately colonnades and triumphal arches, interspersed\r\nwith the foliage of the tall and graceful palm; and, above all, the\r\npure, white temple, “a mount of alabaster, topped with golden spires,”\r\nflashing in the morning sunlight with a splendor that forced the eyes\r\nto turn aside.\r\n\r\nCrispus looked at it, and thought of his dream.\r\n\r\n“Mark me,” said Rufus, “it will never be well with Rome till yon fair\r\ncity be leveled with the dust, and the plow passed over it.”\r\n\r\nProphetic words!\r\n\r\nIf those Jews, among whom Crispus and Rufus were now making their way,\r\ncould but have foreseen the future, their daggers would have flashed\r\nin the sunny air, and the two Romans would have been no more!\r\n\r\nThe supreme emotion evoked among the peasant pilgrims by the sight of\r\nthe holy city was expressed in characteristic fashion. Some laughed\r\naloud in the insanity of joy; others, with clasped hands and tears\r\nin their eyes, sank upon their knees, and not a few among the women\r\nfainted. Some pulled off their sandals, and walked barefoot towards\r\nthe city, as though the way were hallowed ground; others assumed their\r\nrichest robe, as if they were about to enter a holy synagogue. One\r\nmember of the throng, a Levite, lifting up a sonorous voice, began the\r\nchanting of a psalm, appropriate to the occasion; and the refrain was\r\nimmediately taken up by the whole multitude, slow-moving towards the\r\ncity:\r\n\r\n“The hill of Zion is a fair place, and the joy of the whole earth; upon\r\nthe north side lieth the citadel of the Great King.”\r\n\r\n“Now, if by the Great King is meant Cæsar, which is to be doubted,”\r\nremarked Rufus, “these fanatics are right. Thou seest yon edifice,\r\nCrispus, towering high above the temple. ’Tis my Roman citadel, of\r\nwhose hospitality you must partake.”\r\n\r\nMaking their way through a region of groves and gardens, adorned with\r\nthe mansions of the wealthy residents, the Roman troops entered the\r\ncity, and threading its narrow, winding streets, came to their quarters\r\nin the citadel Antonia, so named by Herod the Great in memory of his\r\nfriend and patron, Marc Antony, its usual name among the Jews being\r\nBaris, or the Tower.\r\n\r\nThis fortress occupied the summit of a lofty rock, separated from the\r\nmount on which the temple stood by a deep ravine, crossed by a line of\r\narches. As the temple--in itself a stronghold--dominated and looked\r\ndown upon the city, so did Antonia dominate and look down upon the\r\ntemple. Far above the golden roof of the sanctuary towered its haughty\r\nbattlements, adorned with the standard bearing the significant letters,\r\nS.P.Q.R. Upon that proud banner, the visible symbol of Roman dominion,\r\nno Jew ever looked save with a wrathful curse.\r\n\r\nLeaving his men in their quarters, Rufus, losing no time, set off,\r\naccompanied by Crispus, for the palace of Agrippa, bent on delivering\r\nto that monarch the letter of Florus.\r\n\r\nIt was still early morning, and the streets, thronged by pilgrims,\r\nnew-arriving, presented an animated and busy aspect, which would\r\ndisappear later, when the heat of noontide would usher in the quietude\r\nof the siesta.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, high above the sounds produced by the restless throng, there\r\nrose a voice, and one so weird that Crispus had never before heard the\r\nlike. At its hollow tone, voices, sounds, footsteps, ceased. A hush as\r\nof death fell over all.\r\n\r\nAlong the middle of the street, and moving at a pace that never changed\r\nfrom its slow and measured uniformity, came a wild-eyed, melancholy\r\nfigure, clad in a single robe of camel’s hair, and tied at the waist\r\nwith a leathern girdle.\r\n\r\nHis arms were raised to heaven; he glanced neither to right nor left;\r\nhis face was like a mask of stone, set in one unchanging expression of\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nNo man stopped him; no man questioned him; all knew the uselessness of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe was a familiar figure to the people, but familiarity had never\r\nlessened one thrill of the awe felt by them whenever he appeared.\r\n\r\n“A voice from the East, a voice from the West, a voice from the fours\r\nwinds, a voice against Jerusalem and the holy house, a voice against\r\nthe bridegrooms and the brides, and a voice against this whole people.\r\nWoe, woe to Jerusalem!”\r\n\r\nThe people stood, as they always stood when he passed by, immovable,\r\nsilent, wondering. Did they behold a madman, or one in whom was the\r\nspirit of the ancient prophets?\r\n\r\n“Who is yon fellow?” asked Crispus, watching the figure as it receded\r\nin the distance.\r\n\r\n“Jesus, the son of Hanan. ’Tis four years since he began to appear at\r\nthe yearly feasts, traversing the streets and uttering the woe that we\r\nhave just heard. Brought before the tribunal of the procurator Albinus,\r\nand questioned, he would answer only, ‘Woe, woe to Jerusalem!’ Though\r\nscourged till his bones were laid bare, he maintained during it all a\r\ndry eye and a stony countenance, uttering the while his weird plaint.\r\nHe seems to be, not a man, but a voice.”\r\n\r\n“The voice of some god, it may be,” muttered Crispus, upon whose mind\r\nthe incident had left a singular impression. “Doomed Troy had its\r\nCassandra, whom none would believe until too late. So, too, Jerusalem\r\nseems to have its prophet, to whom this foolish people, that dream of\r\nwar, would do well to give heed.”\r\n\r\nResuming their walk, the two friends ascended the slope of Mount Zion,\r\nand came to the old Asamonean Palace, the residence of King Agrippa.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you coming in with me?” asked Rufus, as Crispus hesitated. “We\r\nmay encounter the Princess Berenice.”\r\n\r\nCrispus turned away, saying he would await his friend’s return in the\r\nXystus close by. Rufus looked after him in some wonderment.\r\n\r\n“For the future,” he muttered, “I had better refrain from mentioning\r\nBerenice’s name; it seems to trouble him.”\r\n\r\nRufus, on being admitted to the presence of Agrippa, found him seated\r\nat a table. In person he was tall and slender. Delicate and refined in\r\nfeatures, and dressed in the height of Jewish fashion, he presented,\r\nat any rate in the eyes of the sturdy Roman, a somewhat effeminate\r\nappearance. On one side of him was his sister Berenice, who had arrived\r\nat Jerusalem the preceding night; on the other was an elderly man with\r\na hooked nose, thin lips, and a yellow polished forehead, who looked\r\nlike a typical rabbi, as indeed he was, being none other than Simeon,\r\nthe son of the celebrated Gamaliel. Before him lay an ink-horn and\r\na parchment-scroll; between his fingers was a calamus or reed pen.\r\nEvidently he had been composing some document with the aid of his royal\r\nfriends, and all three were looking as if very well pleased with their\r\nwork. Rufus wondered whether they would look so well pleased after\r\nreading the document that _he_ was bringing for them.\r\n\r\n“This prayer,” said Simeon, laying his hand upon the parchment-scroll\r\nbefore him, “this prayer will serve as a fan to winnow the chaff from\r\nthe wheat.”\r\n\r\nThe three looked up as Rufus entered. He, being the commandant of\r\nAntonia, was a great man in Jerusalem, and they therefore received him\r\naffably.\r\n\r\n“And what would the excellent Rufus with us?” asked Agrippa.\r\n\r\nThe excellent Rufus handed the letter to the king, who took it between\r\nhis delicate jeweled fingers and broke the seal. While he was doing\r\nthis Berenice rose from the table, and drawing near to Rufus addressed\r\nhim in a low tone.\r\n\r\n“Did you leave Crispus at Cæsarea?”\r\n\r\nHer tone and look, betraying more than ordinary interest in the absent\r\nRoman, came as a revelation to Rufus.\r\n\r\n“As I live,” he thought, “this woman loves Crispus.” Aloud he answered,\r\n“Nay, princess, he hath accompanied me to Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\n“Where is he now?” she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nAnd Rufus, knowing that it would bring trouble into those beautiful\r\neyes were she to learn that the phlegmatic Crispus preferred the\r\nmiscellaneous crowd in the Xystus to the attractions of the Asamonean\r\nPalace, replied, “I left him in Antonia.”\r\n\r\nWhat other question she might have asked was interrupted by Agrippa,\r\nwho, having mastered the contents of the epistle, was frowning\r\nterribly. He called his sister to his side and handed her the letter.\r\nShe knit her brows as she read, and in turn passed the missive to\r\nSimeon, who, after duly perusing it, seemed to be more angry than his\r\nroyal patrons.\r\n\r\nThey were quiet for a time, all thinking.\r\n\r\n“Submit not to this demand,” said Berenice passionately, addressing her\r\nbrother, “since submission will be quoted as a precedent; we shall be\r\nvirtually acknowledging his right to make such claim. One oppression\r\nwill lead to another.”\r\n\r\n“True, but on the other hand,” returned Agrippa, “if he should seek\r\nto make good his demand by force of arms ’twill lead to tumult and\r\nbloodshed--nay, even to open rebellion, for at this present time the\r\npopular mind is strung to a high state of tension by prophets who\r\npredict the near advent of the Messiah’s kingdom.”\r\n\r\nTurning to Rufus he said aloud:\r\n\r\n“You know the contents of this letter?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no. I was told no more than to press for an immediate answer.”\r\n\r\n“I will defer my reply till to-night.”\r\n\r\nRufus bowed and withdrew.\r\n\r\n“I am the cause of this,” said Berenice sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“You, princess! How?” exclaimed Simeon.\r\n\r\n“This is Florus’ way of taking vengeance upon me because I have\r\ndeclined to listen to his wooing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                  WHAT HAPPENED IN THE ROYAL SYNAGOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heat of noontide had passed, and Crispus, under the guidance of\r\nRufus, was spending his time in viewing the city. It might be thought\r\nthat the Temple would be the first place visited by him, but this Rufus\r\nreserved for the night, when, by virtue of his office as commandant of\r\nAntonia, he would be able to exhibit that edifice--or as much of it as\r\nwas permissible for a Gentile to see--by the tender light of the moon,\r\nand freed from the crowds that frequented its courts during the day.\r\n\r\n“And what place is that?” asked Crispus, pointing to a quadrangular\r\nedifice of white stone, over whose portal was written in Hebrew\r\ncharacters the word “_Shalom_,” or “Peace.”\r\n\r\n“The Royal Synagogue, so called,” answered Rufus, necessity here\r\ncompelling him to break a certain injunction he had laid upon himself,\r\n“so called as having been raised by the Princess Berenice at her own\r\nprivate expense. Among the Jews, if you would gain a character for\r\npiety, build a synagogue.”\r\n\r\n“Is the worship going on?”\r\n\r\nThe proximity of a sun-dial enabled Rufus to give an answer. “It is a\r\nlittle before the ninth hour, which constitutes the _Arabith_, or time\r\nof evening prayer. Worship will begin shortly. You see the pious are\r\nalready hurrying thither.”\r\n\r\n“I have never yet seen a synagogue service,” said Crispus, “and would\r\nfain see one.”\r\n\r\n“I deplore your taste, but for friendship’s sake I’ll accompany you.\r\n’Tis the fashion of the Jews, as you see, to run to their synagogue,\r\nby way of showing their eagerness for divine worship. But we, who are\r\ndignified Romans, can take it more leisurely.”\r\n\r\nDiscoursing thus, Rufus drew near the Royal Synagogue.\r\n\r\n“A small edifice, this, but neat,” he continued. “Now if you want to\r\nsee something really splendid in a synagogic shape, go to Alexandria\r\nand view the Diapleuston, with its seventy golden chairs for the\r\nseventy members of the Sanhedrim; and as for size, so vast is it that\r\nthe signal for the ‘Amen’ has to be given by the waving of a flag. ’Tis\r\na striking scene!”\r\n\r\nAs they stood upon the threshold, Rufus addressed the decurion that was\r\nin attendance upon him. “It is forbidden to wear arms in the synagogue;\r\ntherefore, Quintus, take charge of my good sword, and tarry here till I\r\ncome again. Doff we our sandals, Crispus, for ’tis the custom to enter\r\nbarefoot.”\r\n\r\nAccess was gained to the interior of the synagogue by a vestibule. Here\r\nstood the doorkeeper. He recognized in Rufus the commandant of Antonia,\r\nand at the latter’s desire conducted the two visitors to a place at the\r\nrear, where, screened by a pillar, they could see without being seen.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the synagogue was very similar to that of a basilica,\r\nbeing oblong in shape and divided by pillars into aisles.\r\n\r\nThe worshipers were ranged, the men on the one side and the women on\r\nthe other, a partition about four feet high running between them--a\r\nstriking contrast to the modern synagogic usage of placing the women in\r\nside galleries, screened with lattice-work.\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the building was a platform or daïs, on which\r\nstood the ark, or coffer, containing the rolls of the sacred books.\r\nBefore it rose a golden candlestick, with seven branches.\r\n\r\n“A copy of the one in the temple,” observed Rufus.\r\n\r\nIn front of the platform was a line of seats, whose occupants, mostly\r\naged rabbis, sat facing the congregation. These were the places of\r\nhonor, the “chief seats” so much coveted by every Jew; and here, by\r\nspecial privilege, as being the foundress of the synagogue, sat the\r\nPrincess Berenice.\r\n\r\n“Who is that sitting on the right of the princess?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\nFor reply Rufus drew forth a golden coin, and pointed to its obverse,\r\nwhich bore the legend, “Agrippa, the Great King.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, knowing that Agrippa’s realm of Chalcis was of less extent\r\nthan many a Roman estate, asked:\r\n\r\n“In what is he great?”\r\n\r\n“In his own esteem, and in the knowledge of his own law, being expert\r\n‘in all customs and questions which are among the Jews.’ We shall\r\nperhaps have the pleasure of hearing him read from the Law and the\r\nProphets, since he is fond of so doing.”\r\n\r\n“And what is that short marble pillar at one side of the daïs?”\r\n\r\n“That is the Red Column. Offenders against synagogic discipline are\r\ntied to it and scourged.”\r\n\r\nRufus had scarcely said this when the people rose to their feet, the\r\ncustomary attitude for prayer.\r\n\r\nThe shelîach, or “angel,” who presided over this part of the worship\r\nwas Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, and he began with an announcement that\r\ncaused no little surprise among the members of the congregation.\r\n\r\nThere was to be made, beginning with that very day, an addition to\r\nthe current liturgy of the synagogue, an addition necessitated by the\r\nconduct of those impious sectaries, the Nazarenes.\r\n\r\n“Who are the Nazarenes?” whispered Crispus.\r\n\r\n“The Christians,” replied Rufus.\r\n\r\nIt was well known--so ran the tenor of Simeon’s remarks--that in spite\r\nof their changed faith, these apostates, being in no way recognizable,\r\nsince they preserved the outward semblance of orthodox Jews, were\r\nin the habit of resorting to the synagogues, and of joining in the\r\nworship, thus defiling the holy people by their presence. As such mixed\r\nworship could not be acceptable to God, the true Jew must take steps\r\nto preserve himself from such defilement. Therefore for the future the\r\ninitiatory prayer would be of a character such as no Nazarene could\r\njoin in without at the same time abjuring his faith, since it contained\r\ncurses directed against Jesus, the son of Panther.[8] That prayer he\r\nwould now proceed to recite, and let each member of the congregation\r\nmark well his neighbor, and take due note of him who should refuse to\r\nratify it with the customary “Amen.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Jesus, the son of Panther?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“The same as he whom we call Christus. His disciples say that he was\r\nborn of a pure virgin--a manifest impossibility. The Jews, with more\r\nreason, assert that his mother committed adultery with a soldier named\r\nPanther.”\r\n\r\nNow, as Crispus was passing his eyes over the congregation at this\r\njuncture, he happened to see what had hitherto escaped his notice.\r\nVashti was standing among the worshipers. She was pale, very pale;\r\nthe expression of her face, the very attitude of her figure, were\r\nsuggestive of mental distress.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Crispus was puzzled to account for her agitation; then the\r\ntruth like a flash of light darted into his mind. Vashti had a secret,\r\nand one that could no longer be kept hidden by her unless she chose to\r\nplay the traitress to her conscience, and that, he felt certain, she\r\nwould not do.\r\n\r\n“Cursed be Jesus, the Son of Panther!”\r\n\r\nA shiver passed over Vashti; she compressed her lips tightly, while\r\nfrom every other Jewish mouth there flew an “Amen!” uttered with a\r\nvehemence that spoke of a fierce and vindictive hatred.\r\n\r\nEre Simeon could come to his next sentence, a man by the partition--it\r\nwas Sadas, Berenice’s freedman--who had been intently watching Vashti,\r\nsuddenly raised his arm to attract attention, and cried in a voice that\r\npenetrated to every corner of the congregation:\r\n\r\n“Holy rabbi, here is one who refuses to say ‘Amen’ to that anathema.”\r\n\r\nAmid the breathless silence that followed, all eyes turned, first upon\r\nthe speaker, then upon the person pointed out by his accusatory finger.\r\n\r\nThe congregation doubted. This maiden, so regular in her attendance at\r\nthe synagogue, daughter of the rabbi Hyrcanus, and ward of the orthodox\r\nJosephus, an apostate? It could not be.\r\n\r\n“Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus,” said Simeon gravely, “do you refuse to\r\njoin in the common voice of the synagogue?”\r\n\r\nVashti was silent.\r\n\r\n“Cursed be Jesus, the son of Panther! Do you not say ‘Amen’ to this\r\nanathema?”\r\n\r\nAt this, which to her mind was blasphemy, the girl’s spirit took fire.\r\n\r\n“I do not. It is our duty not to curse, but to bless.”\r\n\r\n“Are you wiser than our fathers and the prophets who were wont to curse\r\nthe enemies of the faith?”\r\n\r\n“They belonged to a covenant that is past. Besides, even they did not\r\ncurse the dead.”\r\n\r\n“Then curse we the living!” cried Simeon angrily. “Cursed be the whole\r\ntribe of Christians! Do you say ‘Amen’ to that?”\r\n\r\n“In doing so I should be cursing myself.”\r\n\r\nFrom the age of twelve, her time of joining the synagogue, Vashti, by\r\nreason of the sweetness of her disposition and of her liberality in\r\nalms-giving, had won the favor of the whole congregation. But now, all\r\nin a moment, that favor was withdrawn. Jewish bigotry asserted itself.\r\nThe knowledge that she had become a Christian converted friends into\r\nenemies. She found herself surrounded by dark and scowling faces.\r\n\r\n“Judgment!” cried Sadas, the man who had accused her; and a hundred\r\nvoices took up the cry, “Judgment!”\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrew word for synagogue--Beth-din, or House of Judgment--is\r\nexpressed one of its peculiarities; besides being a place of worship,\r\nthe synagogue was also--and this with the sanction of the Romans\r\nthemselves--a judicial court for the trial of such offenders as were\r\naccused of violating the precepts of Judaism.\r\n\r\n“Let the damsel be brought hither,” said Simeon in cold judicial tones.\r\n\r\nThe many hands put forth to push her forward were needless; of her own\r\nfree will she walked from her place to the front of the congregation.\r\n\r\nHer girlish figure standing all alone before the crowd of wrathful\r\nspectators failed to elicit their sympathy; the gray-haired elders,\r\nwho were her judges, had likewise hearts of marble; neither youth\r\nnor beauty had power to influence them in the matter of a person\r\napostatizing to the hateful creed of the Nazarenes.\r\n\r\n“Damsel,” said Simeon, “we require no witnesses of thy guilt. Out of\r\nthine own mouth thou standest condemned as being a Christian. Yet are\r\nwe minded to give thee time for reflection. Thou mayest, if thou wilt,\r\nwithdraw thy statement.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot withdraw the statement, for it is true. I am a Christian.”\r\n\r\nFierce cries broke forth from the assembly: “Traitress! Apostate!\r\nNazarene!”\r\n\r\n“How long hast thou been a Christian?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis a matter of a few weeks only.”\r\n\r\n“You have received the baptism prescribed by this heresy?”\r\n\r\nVashti signified assent.\r\n\r\n“Who was he that baptized thee?”\r\n\r\n“I may not name him.”\r\n\r\n“Doth our city contain many of this faith?”\r\n\r\n“Very many.”\r\n\r\n“Name some,” commanded Simeon. This he said, not believing that she\r\nwould do so, but knowing that her refusal would add to the wrath of the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\n“Even among the heathen to betray one’s friends is counted base. How\r\nmuch more, then, among Christians?”\r\n\r\n“By revealing their names you will be doing much towards redeeming\r\nyourself from the punishment that otherwise will most surely come upon\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Not even to redeem myself from death will I betray my friends.”\r\n\r\n“Come, girl, be not obstinate. Who were they that persuaded you to\r\nadopt Christianity?”\r\n\r\n“The Law and the Prophets chiefly.”\r\n\r\n“You blaspheme.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, give me leave to speak, and I will show you that our so-called\r\nnew faith is but the fulfillment and completion of the old.”\r\n\r\n“This damsel resembles her master Paul,” sneered Agrippa. “With a\r\nlittle talking she thinks to make us Christians.”\r\n\r\nSimeon, seeking to prejudice her still more in the opinion of the\r\nnarrow-minded Jews, to whom all Gentile learning was an abomination,\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n“You have given much time to the study of the Greek writings?”\r\n\r\n“As did your father Gamaliel,” was the quiet reply. “If it were a\r\nvirtue in him, why seek to make it a fault in me?”\r\n\r\n“Hear, O Israel,” said Simeon, addressing the assembly, “in my father’s\r\nschool were a thousand students, of whom five hundred studied the\r\nwisdom that is in the Law; and to-day they are all living, and held in\r\nhonor. And there were five hundred who studied the Grecian vanities,\r\nand to-day there is not one of them alive.”[9] He paused for a moment,\r\nand then put the customary question:\r\n\r\n“Can anyone here present show just cause why punishment should not be\r\ninflicted upon Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus?”\r\n\r\nVashti looked round upon the assembly, but in the words of the Psalmist\r\nshe had become a stranger to her brethren, an alien among her mother’s\r\nchildren. There was none that would speak a good word for her.\r\n\r\n“There are two persons here,” said Vashti, “who can testify, if they\r\nwould, that my change of creed is not deserving of punishment.”\r\n\r\n“Who are these witnesses?”\r\n\r\n“King Agrippa for one.”\r\n\r\nThat monarch, upon hearing himself appealed to, regarded Vashti with a\r\nlanguid and scornful gaze.\r\n\r\n“Thou callest upon _me_ to testify in thy favor?”\r\n\r\n“O king, after Paul of Tarsus had set forth his tenets before your\r\ntribunal, did you not say, ‘This man doeth nothing worthy of death or\r\nof bonds’? My faith is but the same with his. Since you pronounced\r\n_him_ innocent, how can you declare _me_ guilty?”\r\n\r\nThese words put the king in a very awkward dilemma. Deny them he could\r\nnot; to confirm them would be equivalent to a declaration of her\r\ninnocence. He shrugged his shoulders, and, like the coward that he was,\r\ntook refuge in silence.\r\n\r\n“And who is the other witness?” asked Simeon, after a very awkward\r\npause.\r\n\r\n“Yourself,” replied Vashti. “Will _you_ not plead for me, you whose\r\ngrandsire Simeon held the infant Jesus in his arms, calling him ‘The\r\nglory of the people of Israel’?--you, whose sire Gamaliel, speaking of\r\nthe apostles of Christ, said, ‘Refrain from these men, and let them\r\nalone’?”\r\n\r\nSimeon’s face darkened, and he turned away. Every word spoken by Vashti\r\ndid but increase the wrath of her judges, who wanted, not argument,\r\nbut submission and recantation.\r\n\r\nNo more questions were asked. The council, drawing together, conferred\r\nin whispers around the chairs of Agrippa and Berenice.\r\n\r\nHaving agreed in their verdict, the judges returned to their seats--all\r\nsave one, a noble and gentle-looking elder, who said with a ring of\r\nindignation in his voice:\r\n\r\n“I protest!”\r\n\r\nBut his protest availed nothing. Unable to save Vashti or to bear the\r\nsight of her punishment, he walked from the synagogue amid the somewhat\r\nangry murmurs of the assembly.\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Johanan ben Zacchai, wisest and best of the rabbis. Though he himself\r\nis an orthodox Pharisee, his father Zacchai, or--to Grecize the\r\nname--Zacchæus, a wealthy publican of Jericho, is said to have been a\r\nsecret Christian. Hence his sympathy for poor Vashti. Are you going to\r\nintervene on her behalf?”\r\n\r\n“Anon. Let us first see what her punishment is to be.”\r\n\r\nSimeon now rose to pronounce judgment.\r\n\r\n“Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus, your punishment is a twofold one; you\r\nwill receive forty lashes save one, and you will be shorn of your\r\ntresses.”\r\n\r\nThe vindictive character of the sentence set Crispus’ blood on fire.\r\n“To be shorn of her tresses?” he murmured. “Such a suggestion as that\r\ncould proceed only from a woman’s mind. Princess Berenice, your hand is\r\nin this.”\r\n\r\nVashti, on hearing her doom, swayed, and would have fallen to the\r\nground but for the officers who supported her on each side. She had\r\nexpected some such penalty as the payment of a fine, or excommunication\r\nfrom the synagogue. But the loss of her hair--the glory of a woman! And\r\n_scourging_! The mere physical pain of this last was as nothing in her\r\neyes compared with the horror of being stripped to the waist in the\r\nsight of all the congregation.\r\n\r\nA mist swam before her eyes; her face, pale before, now became deathly\r\nwhite; she tried to speak, but her tongue failed her.\r\n\r\nLooking for all the world like one insane, she turned her swimming gaze\r\nupon the assembly, but saw no pity in their set faces. What punishment\r\ncould be too severe for a Nazarene? Nay, verily, let her be thankful\r\nthat her doom was not stoning, as it assuredly would have been but for\r\nthe humiliating fact that the death penalty required the sanction of\r\nthe hateful governor, Florus.\r\n\r\nAnd now appeared the executioner carrying the dreadful whip, a wooden\r\nshaft with three long ox-hide thongs, thirteen strokes from which made\r\nthe conventional thirty-nine stripes. The Law allowed forty, but the\r\nJews, affecting to be merciful, diminished that number by one.\r\n\r\n“Pull off her garment, and bind her to the Red Column.”\r\n\r\nAt these dreadful words Vashti, rendered strong by agony, broke from\r\nher guards, and moving swiftly forward fell on her knees before\r\nBerenice.\r\n\r\n“Princess, you are a woman. Have pity on me. If I must be scourged let\r\nme--let me retain my vesture.”\r\n\r\nThe two officers who had followed Vashti fell back at a sign from\r\nBerenice. Bending forward from her seat, she said in a whisper:\r\n\r\n“_My hour of triumph now. It was yours at Cæsarea._”\r\n\r\nAt her chilling tone Vashti shrank back. Her eyes became big with\r\nhorror as the truth suddenly flashed upon her that the whole synagogue\r\nproceeding was a plot, formed by the jealousy of Berenice, who feared\r\nthat Vashti was seeking to win the love of Crispus. Suspecting her\r\nto be a Christian, she had induced Simeon to compose the new prayer,\r\npurposing by this means to wreak her vengeance upon the girl whose\r\nbeauty had been preferred to her own.\r\n\r\nThis sudden revelation of the character of the princess, the subtlety\r\nof her plot, the wickedness of masking it under the guise of religion,\r\ncame upon Vashti with a shock so great as almost to drive the scourging\r\nfrom her mind. For the moment her only thought was, how could the\r\nprincess be so wicked?\r\n\r\n“Officers, the lash!” said Berenice, spurning the suppliant girl with\r\nher foot.\r\n\r\n“Hold, let the maiden be!” cried a voice coming from the rear of the\r\nsynagogue.\r\n\r\nThere was a great start on the part of Berenice, who knew not till then\r\nthat Crispus was in the synagogue.\r\n\r\nVashti started, but it was with joy. Gone in a moment was her sense\r\nof fear. She turned her eyes from the two men who held her to the\r\nstately figure of the Roman stalking up the floor of the synagogue,\r\ndetermination written upon his countenance. Her trusting and beautiful\r\nsmile set Berenice’s heart thrilling with pangs of jealousy impossible\r\nto describe. Her plot for the humiliation of Vashti seemed likely to\r\nend in creating another link of sympathy between the two whom she would\r\nfain keep apart.\r\n\r\nAmid a death-like silence Crispus, followed by the faithful Rufus, made\r\nhis way to the front. There was in his cold eye a gleam that caused the\r\ntwo officers to let go Vashti, who, released from their hold, would\r\nhave fallen but for the supporting arm of Crispus.\r\n\r\nHe turned to face the angry assembly, who were beginning to murmur at\r\nseeing the hateful “apostate” snatched from their hands by an authority\r\nequally hateful. A stranger in Jerusalem, Crispus was unknown both\r\nto the congregation and to Agrippa, which last took him to be some\r\nmeddlesome officer from Antonia, bent on exercising an authority to\r\nwhich he had no claim.\r\n\r\nHe started to his feet with an angry air.\r\n\r\n“Who is this that seeks to interfere with the course of Jewish justice?\r\nKnow you not that I am Agrippa, the great king? Who art thou?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Rufus quietly, “is Crispus Cestius, son of the Syrian\r\nLegate, a maker of kings, and--an unmaker.”\r\n\r\nThis answer completely confounded Agrippa. He recognized the wisdom of\r\nbecoming immediately humble. The authority of the Proprætor of Syria,\r\nthe Ruler of the East, soared far above that of Judæan procurators\r\nand Herodian kings. A hint from him to the Roman Senate that Agrippa\r\nwas unworthy of his post would be quite sufficient to deprive him of\r\nhis crown. Smoothing his brows, and assuming a smile that in no way\r\nharmonized with his inward feelings, he said:\r\n\r\n“And what would the noble Crispus have of us?”\r\n\r\n“The release of this maiden.”\r\n\r\nThe politic Agrippa, on the point of granting the request, was stayed\r\nby his more strong-minded sister, who was not disposed to let the\r\ncaptive go without at least a protest.\r\n\r\n“By whose authority do you make this demand?”\r\n\r\n“By that of the Legate of Syria.”\r\n\r\n“Will you let us see in the Legate’s own handwriting the order for the\r\nrelease of Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus?” said Berenice, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n“He acts by me, his secretary and deputy.”\r\n\r\n“How know we that he will confirm your act?”\r\n\r\n“Should he refuse to do so I will restore the maiden to your hands,”\r\nsaid Crispus, who knew that he was quite safe in giving this pledge.\r\n\r\nTaking courage by his sister’s example, Agrippa now ventured upon a\r\nmild protest.\r\n\r\n“But, noble Crispus, you are infringing Jewish rights. The Legate hath\r\nno jurisdiction over the internal affairs of our synagogues.”\r\n\r\nCrispus gave a disdainful smile.\r\n\r\n“The authority of Cestius Gallus is supreme over every matter, small\r\nor great, within the province of Syria; he has power to reverse any\r\njudicial sentence, whether of basilica or synagogue, that he deems\r\nunjust, as he will certainly deem this to be when it comes to his\r\nhearing. Do you question his authority, O king?”\r\n\r\nBerenice answered for her brother.\r\n\r\n“It is not to be doubted,” said she, “that a fond father will ratify\r\nthe action of a foolish son. Pronounce the damsel free, Agrippa. Cæsar\r\nat Rome may burn Christians alive, but we of Judæa must not even whip\r\nthem. The great Crispus forbids it.” And gathering her robe around her\r\nshe swept out with a proud and scornful air.\r\n\r\nThe two Romans--no man daring to stay them--proceeded to remove the\r\ntrembling Vashti from the synagogue, and, attended by the decurion\r\nQuintus, they conducted her to the gate of her house in the street of\r\nMillo.\r\n\r\n“So, Vashti, you are a Christian?” said Crispus. “I think I understand\r\nnow the allusion in the poet Bianor, ‘By the Fish we are saved.’”\r\n\r\nShe smiled, pleased to think that he had remembered her words.\r\n\r\n“Under the name of ‘The Fish,’” said she, “we symbolize our Divine\r\nMaster, who leads us through the waters of baptism.”\r\n\r\nAs she spoke--they were standing at the time within the gateway of\r\nher dwelling--their ears were caught by the tread of numerous feet\r\naccompanied by fierce cries, and looking whence these sounds proceeded\r\nthey saw, coming at a quick pace and with faces expressive of the\r\nwildest excitement, a mob of Jews, some carrying steel weapons and\r\nothers wooden clubs.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the three Romans sprang within the stone passage, dragging\r\nVashti with them, and closed and barred the gate.\r\n\r\nThey soon discovered, however, that they were not the objects of\r\nattack; it was doubtful whether they had even been seen. Like the rush\r\nof a whirlwind the crowd swept past the gateway, rending the air with\r\ntheir cries.\r\n\r\nSimilar sounds, proceeding from the adjacent streets, showed that these\r\nalso were being traversed by excited throngs.\r\n\r\n“Down with Florus!” shouted some.\r\n\r\n“That’s a saying with which I can very well sympathize,” said Rufus.\r\n\r\n“Death to the Romans!” cried others.\r\n\r\n“Ha! that’s a different matter. That touches you and me,” he continued,\r\naddressing Crispus.\r\n\r\n“The temple of the Lord! The temple of the Lord! Sacrilege! Sacrilege!”\r\n\r\nSuccessive waves of people rolled along the street, voluble women\r\namong them, dragging their slow-moving children by the hand. Their\r\nfragmentary talk soon enabled the listening Romans to gather the cause\r\nof all this excitement.\r\n\r\nFlorus had sent to Agrippa demanding seventeen talents from the Corban,\r\nsaying that he wanted them for Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish mind was fired to wrath not so much by the amount\r\nitself--which was rather a small one for a man of Florus’ rapacity,\r\nthe sum being about £6,000 in modern English currency--but by the fact\r\nthat the demand was made upon the Corban or Temple treasury. The gold\r\ndeposited there was regarded as sacred to Jehovah, to be used only in\r\nHis service; the diverting of even a single shekel of it to any other\r\npurpose was, in the eyes of the frenzied Jew, one of the greatest of\r\ncrimes. It would be a crime if committed by the high priest himself;\r\nbut when the demand came from a heathen, unclean, uncircumcized,\r\nrapacious, whose object, as all well knew, was not to transmit the\r\nmoney to Cæsar but to spend it upon his own sensual pleasures, it\r\nwas no wonder that the contemplated profanation should fire the blood\r\nof every Jew, and send him running with all haste to prevent the\r\nsacrilegious deed.\r\n\r\n“It is as I have said,” whispered Rufus to Crispus. “Florus is\r\npurposely trying to create a revolt.”\r\n\r\n“Vain is it for Rome to boast of her justice,” sighed Crispus, “when\r\nshe sends forth governors such as Florus.”\r\n\r\n“If there be an uproar in the temple,” continued Rufus, “it is my duty\r\nto quell it.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as the street of Millo had become comparatively quiet the three\r\nRomans stole forth, taking a wide circuit so as to arrive upon the\r\nnorth side of Antonia, the side farthest from the temple.\r\n\r\nOn their way they encountered a company of youthful and richly-dressed\r\nJews, who, basket on arm, in imitation of beggars, were soliciting alms\r\nby way of casting ridicule upon the procurator.\r\n\r\n“Give an obolus for Florus, he is so poor!” they whined in a mocking\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“Woe to them if Florus gets to hear of it!” muttered Rufus.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Turris Antonia he found that his centurions had\r\ntaken all precautions for the safety of the fortress. Upon the roof of\r\nthe cloisters facing the bridge that connected the fortress with the\r\ntemple, the Italian Cohort was drawn up in all the glittering panoply\r\nof war, their silence and discipline presenting a striking contrast to\r\nthe tumult and disorder that was raging not many yards distant.\r\n\r\nThe temple-courts were filled with a crowd so numerous that it seemed\r\nas if the whole city must have assembled there. To the mind of Crispus\r\nwith his Roman love of order there was something peculiarly repulsive\r\nin the spectacle before him. It was an Oriental mob, and like all\r\nOriental mobs when inflamed with rage, its units behaved like frenzied\r\ndemons. They spat towards the Romans; they tossed their garments; they\r\nshook their fists; they yelled out curses; they cast dust into the air.\r\n\r\nThe wilder spirits among them took to flinging stones, the rattle of\r\nwhich, falling upon the brazen armor of the soldiery, was audible above\r\nthe tumult of voices; of all which the superbly disciplined Roman\r\ntroops took no more heed than a man takes of gnats on a summer eve.\r\n\r\nRufus, advancing to the head of the stairs that descended to the\r\ntemple-court, lifted his hand. The sign was perceived and understood,\r\nbut it was some time ere the crowd quieted down to a listening mood.\r\n\r\nStanding upon the very place where, eight years previously, Saint Paul\r\nhad addressed a raging mob, and speaking in the same language--the\r\nSyro-Chaldaic--Rufus sought to pacify the fears of the multitude.\r\n\r\nFlorus, it seemed, had demanded seventeen talents to be taken from the\r\nCorban. He--Rufus--was not prepared to say that the Jews were wrong in\r\nresenting this demand; as the servant of Florus it was not his business\r\nto criticise the actions of his master, but the Jews were certainly\r\nwrong in their way of showing their disapproval. The lawful method\r\nwas to dispatch an embassy to Florus to state why they considered the\r\ndemand unreasonable. Let them do so without delay. If they were now\r\nassembling under the belief that he--Rufus--was going to invade their\r\nsanctuary for the purpose of seizing the seventeen talents they were in\r\nerror; he had not received any such order from Florus, and till such\r\norder came he would be endangering his own head if he should venture\r\nto forestall the will of the procurator. They could, therefore, depart\r\nquietly to their homes in the full assurance that their treasures would\r\nremain untouched for that day, at least, and probably for several days\r\nto come. As to what might ultimately happen, well, it was not wise to\r\nanticipate evil.\r\n\r\nRufus had scarcely made an end of speaking when on the still air rose\r\nthe chiming of the silver trumpets, blown by the priests as a signal\r\nthat the hour had come for the closing of the temple.\r\n\r\nThe crowd murmured, hesitated, but finally departed in peaceful\r\nfashion, and the great temple-courts were left to silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                           “LET US GO HENCE!”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of Crispus’ first day in Jerusalem, and Rufus, who,\r\nas the Roman overlord of the temple, had free access to its outer\r\ncourts during any hour of the day or night, now suggested a quiet and\r\ncontemplative walk around its cloisters.\r\n\r\n“Come!” said he, “and I will show you THE STRONGEST FORTRESS IN THE\r\nWORLD!”\r\n\r\nBy the glorious light of an Eastern moon, that silvered the sleeping\r\ncity and the peaceful hills around it, the two Romans crossed the arch\r\nconnecting the fortress Antonia with the northern side of the Temple\r\nHill, the hill anciently known by the name of Mount Moriah.\r\n\r\nThey descended a flight of stairs and entered the northern cloister\r\nof the temple, a cloister divided into two long aisles by lines of\r\nmarble columns, forty feet in height, and formed of marble, beautifully\r\npolished.\r\n\r\n“Each of these columns,” remarked Rufus, “consists of a single block.”\r\n\r\nThe roof of the cloister was of cedar, curiously graven, and the\r\npavement a mosaic of many colors.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent colonnade was reared upon the very edge of the scarped\r\ncliff, and extended in a direct line east and west for a length of more\r\nthan one thousand feet.\r\n\r\n“The temple-platform,” observed Rufus, “as you will see, after having\r\ngone round it, forms an irregular quadrangle, and occupies the flat\r\nsummit of a precipitous rock. We’ll inspect all four sides in turn.\r\nFirst, what think you of this, the northern side?”\r\n\r\nCrispus turned his eyes upon Antonia, frowning white in the moonlight\r\nfrom the other side of the ravine.\r\n\r\n“Throw down that arch,” said he, “and you make this side of the temple\r\npractically unassailable, and--but whom have we here?” he added,\r\nbreaking off suddenly.\r\n\r\nSlowly making their way along the cloister came a band of men clothed\r\nin semi-military garb, and bearing spears. A few carried torches, whose\r\nyellow glare was reflected from the polished surface of column and\r\npavement.\r\n\r\n“Be it known to you,” said Rufus, “that the temple has _two_ captains,\r\nRoman and Jewish. While it is my duty from Antonia to keep watch _over_\r\nthe temple, it is the duty of yon officer to keep watch _within_ it.\r\nThis is the Levitical guard going its round. Woe to the sentinel whom\r\nthey find asleep. They’ll beat him with clubs, or wake him by setting\r\nfire to his clothing.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the fierce-looking hero marching at their head?”\r\n\r\n“That, my dear Crispus, is the rival captain of the temple, Eleazar,\r\nson of the ex-high priest Ananias, whom you have already seen at\r\nCæsarea. Betwixt father and son is open war. Ananias, suave and polite,\r\ncourts the good graces of the Romans; Eleazar, sullen and fierce,\r\nboasts his hatred of us. He is said to be secretly leagued with Zealot\r\nbanditti, and to have known more than he ought of the doings of Simon\r\nthe Black. Indeed, Quintus is of opinion that the fugitive Zealot,\r\nwith the connivance of Eleazar, is at the present moment hiding within\r\nthe sanctuary. If so, he is secure from arrest, for Cæsar himself may\r\nnot enter there. So deep a scorn hath this Eleazar for Romans that he\r\nrefuses to return their salutations. Be thyself a witness.”\r\n\r\nThe Levitical guard had by this time reached the place where the two\r\nRomans were standing.\r\n\r\n“Peace to you, Eleazar,” said Rufus, raising his hand in salute.\r\n\r\nBut the Jewish captain marched past at the head of his guard, taking no\r\nnotice whatever of the Roman.\r\n\r\nRufus laughed with good-humored contempt.\r\n\r\n“What did I tell you?” said he to Crispus. “That was not well done,\r\nEleazar,” he called out after the receding figure. “Johanan ben Zacchai\r\nmakes it his boast[10] that he never yet let Gentile forestall him in\r\ngiving the salaam.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, Rufus led the way to the eastern cloister, which,\r\nextending in an even line due north and south, formed the second side\r\nof the irregular square.\r\n\r\n“Now here we have a truly Titanic work,” he said. “When the temple was\r\nfirst planned by an ancient king called Solomon, he found the summit of\r\nthe hill too small for his architectural ideas, so what did he do but\r\nrear a wall sheer up from the valley below till it was on a level with\r\nthe top of the mount; the vacancy betwixt the wall and the mount was\r\nthen filled in with earth and stone, and on the esplanade thus formed\r\nwas built this grand colonnade, which we now see; hence its name,\r\nSolomon’s Colonnade. From the summit of yon pinnacle at the southeast\r\ncorner the plumb-line falls a sheer descent of four hundred and fifty\r\nfeet--at least so say the priests who have measured it. Cast your eye\r\ndownward, and mark the depth!”\r\n\r\nAs Crispus leaned far over the stone balustrade, and ran his eye first\r\nto the right and then to the left along the vast mass of masonry,\r\nrising vertically in mid-air, he muttered: “The gods themselves would\r\nnot dare attack the temple from this side.”\r\n\r\nFar down, scarcely visible, glinted a slender line of water.\r\n\r\n“The brook Cedron,” said Rufus, “flowing to-day, dry in summer. The\r\nname Cedron, or Black, is justly deserved, for into the rivulet flows\r\nthe black blood of the daily sacrifices conducted thither by channels\r\nbored through the solid rock.”\r\n\r\n“How name you yon fair hill in front of us?”\r\n\r\n“The Mount of Olives, so called from its trees. Come, view we now the\r\nthird side.”\r\n\r\nThey passed on to the southern cloister, which, like the eastern, was\r\nbuilt upon a vast substructure of masonry rising in massive grandeur\r\nfrom the valley below.\r\n\r\n“This,” said Rufus, “bears the name of the Royal Colonnade, as being\r\nthe grandest of all, for whereas the other cloisters have but two rows\r\nof pillars, this has four. And mark them! Each column is a monolith,\r\nfifty feet in height, and as to its thickness, three men with joined\r\nhands can scarcely encircle it.”\r\n\r\nThis Royal Colonnade, open on the side towards the temple, was closed\r\nupon the other by a wall. The two, therefore, mounted a staircase and\r\nwalked along its roof.\r\n\r\n“Those houses whose roofs you see beneath us extending far to the\r\nsouthward, form the suburb of Ophel, the residence of the priests and\r\ntheir servants, the Levites and Nethinim, whose duty necessitates their\r\nliving near the temple.”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” muttered Crispus, as he gazed downwards, “that he\r\nwould be a bold general who would venture to make his attack from the\r\nsouth side.”\r\n\r\nWalking onward, they came to the last, or western cloister, whose edge\r\noverhung the ravine known as the Valley of Tyropæon, a deep cleft that\r\ncompletely severed the temple-mount both from Acra or the Lower City,\r\nwhich lay due west, and from Zion or the Upper City, which lay to the\r\nsouthwest.\r\n\r\nThe temple-hill and Mount Zion were joined by a stone bridge, a\r\nmagnificent structure, being in length 354 feet, and having a roadway\r\n50 feet broad; in the center the depth of the valley beneath was 225\r\nfeet!\r\n\r\n“Well, what think you of this--the fourth side?”\r\n\r\n“Destroy the bridge, and you make this part of the temple inaccessible.”\r\n\r\n“Yet this was the side--there was no bridge then--that our great Pompey\r\nsuccessfully stormed.”\r\n\r\n“It speaks ill for the skill of the defenders.”\r\n\r\n“But well for the courage of the Romans--eh? But I doubt whether even\r\nPompey would have carried his assault had not Jewish superstition\r\nfavored him.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“He was told that the Jews had such reverence for the Sabbath that they\r\nwould not fight on that day unless actually attacked. He therefore\r\nspent every Sabbath in raising huge mounds, and the rest of the week\r\nin guarding them; at the end of twelve months he made his triumphal\r\nattack.”\r\n\r\n“Would the Jews again act so supinely, think you?”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it. Since then they have seen the folly of their ways.”\r\n\r\nHaving walked all round the colonnades to the point whence they set\r\nout, the two friends now passed into the spacious court open to the\r\nsky. In the middle of this court rose the Sanctuary, or the Temple\r\nproperly so called.\r\n\r\n“It stands, if you will believe the Jews, upon the very center of\r\nthe earth’s surface,” remarked Rufus. “In the adytum the stone upon\r\nwhich the high priest deposits his censer upon the Day of Atonement is\r\nregarded as the navel of the earth.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, approaching the edifice upon its north side, experienced a\r\nstrange thrill as he beheld, just as it had appeared in the dream, the\r\ngolden-latticed window through which he had flung the incendiary torch.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Rufus, to what room that window belongs?” he asked,\r\npointing it out.\r\n\r\n“’Tis one of the windows of the Hall Gazith, the chamber in which the\r\nSanhedrim meet to try those accused on a capital charge. Among others\r\ncondemned there, was the founder of the sect of the Christians, who\r\nworship their Master as a god; though, methinks, if he had aught of\r\ndivinity in him he should have delivered himself from his enemies.”\r\n\r\nThey walked round to the east, the quarter that gave them the finest\r\nview of the edifice.\r\n\r\nIt was a fabric of white marble, inferior, doubtless, in point of\r\nbeauty to the graceful temples of Greece, but far superior to them in\r\nsize and magnificence; and as for solidity, Rufus was careful to point\r\nout to the wondering Crispus that some of the blocks composing the\r\nexternal wall were no less than sixty feet in length!\r\n\r\n“A fortress within a fortress!” he murmured, viewing the fabric with\r\nthe eye of a soldier. “He who captures the cloisters has but begun his\r\nwork.”\r\n\r\nBut the glories hidden within the Sanctuary were not for the gaze\r\nof Gentiles. Around the whole of the edifice ran a low marble\r\nbalustrade--the “middle wall of partition”--whose dwarf pilasters\r\nbore inscriptions in Greek and Latin, forbidding the alien to proceed\r\nfurther on pain of death.\r\n\r\nHere and there, as Crispus could see, half-concealed in the shadows of\r\nthe temple-wall, stood the dusky forms of sentinels, who, though to all\r\nappearances inert, were nevertheless keeping a jealous watch upon the\r\ntwo Romans.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the Sanctuary was not upon the same level as the floor of\r\nthe Court of the Gentiles, but stood at an altitude of twenty-two feet\r\nabove it, upon the summit of a solid platform of masonry.\r\n\r\nThis elevation was ascended by a stately flight of stairs leading up\r\nto a magnificent pylon, whose twofold gate was richly plated with\r\nCorinthian bronze, a composite metal, more esteemed in that age than\r\nsilver or gold.\r\n\r\n“The Eastern or Corinthian Gate,” remarked Rufus.\r\n\r\nThough access to the temple was forbidden to the Romans, there was not\r\nwanting even upon its very forefront the sign of the Roman dominion.\r\n\r\nOver this gateway was the golden image of an eagle with extended wings,\r\na surprising sight in view of the Jewish hatred of sculpture.\r\n\r\n“Placed there by Herod the Great out of compliment to Augustus, and\r\nthough many a fiery Zealot has climbed up there with intent to hew it\r\ndown, our procurators have determined to keep it there.”\r\n\r\nHaving taken as close a view of the edifice as was permissible, Crispus\r\ndrew back to contemplate it from a distance.\r\n\r\nHe had all a Roman’s reverence for antiquity, and the thought that the\r\nsmoke of the daily sacrifice had ascended from this temple for the\r\nspace of more than a thousand years was well adapted to impress his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nHallowed by the white light of the moon, the fabric rose with solemn\r\nand majestic air, the very stillness resting upon it seeming to have in\r\nit something of the divine.\r\n\r\nHe was tempted almost to believe in the strange miracles said to\r\nhave occurred here--above all in the permanent miracle asserted by\r\nevery Jew that the dark, central shrine, curtained off from mortal\r\nview, and never trodden by human foot save once a year only, was the\r\ndwelling-place of the deity himself!\r\n\r\nA light touch upon his arm ended this reverie, and Crispus, on turning,\r\nfound himself looking into the eyes of the Princess Berenice--very\r\nlovely eyes they were, too!--yet in them he fancied he could detect a\r\nlight as of fear, due perhaps to the wild belief that he had come to\r\ntake a clandestine view of the temple as a preliminary to the flinging\r\nof the incendiary torch.\r\n\r\n“What do you here, princess?”\r\n\r\n“Keeping watch upon you,” she said with a laugh that was not all a\r\nlaugh. “It is my habit to walk at night in these courts.”\r\n\r\nRufus at this juncture thought fit to slip quietly away, leaving the\r\ntwo together.\r\n\r\nCrispus thought of the circumstances in which he had last seen the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\n“Why look you so earnestly at me?” smiled Berenice, becoming conscious\r\nof a very attentive gaze on his part.\r\n\r\n“I am wondering, princess, why eyes so beautiful and gracious as yours\r\nare now could look so pitilessly upon poor Vashti.”\r\n\r\n“My love for my religion is such that it makes me cold, even cruel, to\r\nall who oppose it.”\r\n\r\nHer statement was probably true in a general sense, but Crispus doubted\r\nwhether she had been moved by religious zeal in the case of Vashti.\r\n\r\n“Then you must hate me, who am likewise opposed to your religion?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, you are not an apostate. You have never known the truth.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if anxious to get away from the synagogue scene, in which\r\nshe was conscious that she had not appeared to advantage in Crispus’\r\neyes, she pointed to the Sanctuary and said:\r\n\r\n“Do you not think it beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“’Twere wrong to think otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Too beautiful to be wantonly destroyed,” she said significantly.\r\n\r\n“You see me without the fatal torch--as yet.”\r\n\r\n“As yet?” she repeated, with a touch of fear in her voice. “You\r\nare not--you are not letting that dream still hold a place in your\r\nthoughts?”\r\n\r\n“Whatever opposes Rome must be destroyed, even if it be a temple.”\r\n\r\n“You would destroy our temple? You cannot,” she said, speaking with a\r\nvehemence that surprised, and even startled Crispus, “you cannot. It\r\nis beyond the power of Cæsar and his legions. Let all the nations of\r\nthe earth league together for that end, and they would fail. The temple\r\nis eternal, and cannot be destroyed, for our prophets have so assured\r\nus. The world was made for the sake of the temple,”--she was but\r\nrepeating the doctrine of the rabbis--“and so long as the world shall\r\nstand, so long will the temple stand. When the last day shall come,”\r\nshe continued, her eyes shining with all the enthusiasm of a devotee,\r\n“there will still be seen the smoke of the sacrifice ascending from the\r\naltar. It is the place loved of God, the place where He has chosen to\r\nput His name forever.”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Berenice, and perhaps never in the history of the world did\r\nwords meet with a rebuke more startling and more significant.\r\n\r\nFor scarcely had she finished speaking when there rose upon the air a\r\nmysterious something that caused her to grasp the arm of Crispus with a\r\nconvulsive start.\r\n\r\nFrom the hidden interior of the Sanctuary there came a sound that\r\nbore--to compare it with earthly things--some resemblance to the rising\r\nof a wind; faint at first, its volume increased, little by little,\r\ntill, issuing from the Sanctuary, what seemed to be a rush of air swept\r\nthrough the temple-courts.\r\n\r\nA wind, and yet no wind! It had no effect upon external objects: not a\r\nfold of Crispus’ toga waved; not a hair of the princess was stirred.\r\n\r\nWhat was happening was like nothing earthly; the sense of a mysterious\r\nand unseen presence struck an awe to the soul of Crispus. If he had\r\nnever before believed in the supernatural, he believed in it now; if he\r\nhad never before felt fear, he felt it now. The hand which his first\r\nimpulse had sent to his sword dropped powerlessly to his side again.\r\nWhat availed the might of a legion, or of ten thousand such, against\r\ninvisible and spiritual powers?\r\n\r\nTerror had laid hold of Berenice; half-swooning she sank upon her\r\nknees, her hands still clinging to the wrist of Crispus; but for his\r\ndetaining hold she would have fallen prone upon the pavement.\r\n\r\nClosing her eyes as if to shut out some awful vision that was about to\r\nappear, she faintly gasped with blanched lips: “_The bath col!_”\r\n\r\nShe was not alone in her belief. From different parts of the\r\ntemple-court persons, hitherto unseen by Crispus--priests, Levites,\r\nNethinim--had suddenly started into view, and were gazing up at the\r\nlofty temple, whose long and magnificent façade gleamed like a bank of\r\npearl in the moonlight. And one cry only broke from their lips, to die\r\naway in a feeling of mingled awe and terror:\r\n\r\n“THE BATH COL! THE BATH COL!”\r\n\r\nCrispus was sufficiently familiar with this phrase to know that it\r\nmeant the voice of the deity.\r\n\r\nDid this “sound as of a rushing mighty wind” really emanate from the\r\nHebrew God who was said to ride upon the whirlwind, and to speak in the\r\nvoice of the thunder?\r\n\r\nThat was the belief of the Jews assembled in the court; they were about\r\nto hear the awful voice that had spoken to their fathers from Sinai!\r\n\r\nSlowly--very slowly--the quivering, continuous flow of sound died\r\naway. For a brief space there was a weird spell of silence; then came\r\na sudden clangor, startling by contrast with the previous stillness, a\r\nclangor like that of hollow brass struck by a giant hand.\r\n\r\nAll eyes turned instantly upon the Corinthian Gate of the Sanctuary.\r\nThat great gate, whose folding-doors of plated bronze were so ponderous\r\nas to require the united strength of twenty men to turn them on their\r\nhinges, was now slowly revolving inwards as if yielding to some\r\ninvisible pressure from without.\r\n\r\nWider and wider grew the space between the two doors, till at last they\r\nhad revolved so far back that they could revolve no farther.\r\n\r\nThe gate had opened apparently of its own accord!\r\n\r\nAnd now came an awe-inspiring sequel.\r\n\r\nFrom the interior of the Sanctuary issued a solemn voice, crying in the\r\nHebrew tongue:\r\n\r\n“LET US GO HENCE!”[11]\r\n\r\nAll trembled at the sound; none more than Crispus.\r\n\r\n“The voice that spoke in my dream!”\r\n\r\nThis moment of supreme and thrilling terror was followed by a sequence\r\nof sounds suggestive of the departure of a vast multitude. It seemed\r\nas if ten thousand feet were descending the lofty stairs of the\r\nCorinthian Gate, and were treading the pavement of the forecourt. Yet\r\nneither shape nor shadow met the gaze of the appalled and trembling\r\nJews, who had drawn together in one dense throng as if for protection\r\nagainst--they knew not what!\r\n\r\nAs for Crispus, had he wished to describe his feelings at this awful\r\nmoment he might have employed the language of the sacred writer: “Fear\r\ncame upon me and a trembling that made all my bones to shake. Then a\r\nspirit passed before my face; it stood still, but I could not discern\r\nthe form thereof!”\r\n\r\nFor there was a flowing of air past him, as if some long procession\r\nwere going by; he could detect the sound of rustling garments and of\r\nsighing voices; yet had his life depended upon the action, he durst not\r\nput forth his hand to test whether the unseen train that was gliding\r\npast were palpable to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe sounds passed on, taking their way through the eastern cloister;\r\nand, mounting upon the wings of the night, they melted away in the\r\ndirection of Olivet.\r\n\r\nLong, long after the mysterious voices had ceased, the Jews, filled\r\nwith a divine awe, stood speechless and motionless, as if fearful lest\r\ntheir speaking should call forth the wrath of departing deity.\r\n\r\nAmong the group was the famous rabbi, Johanan ben Zacchai. He was the\r\nfirst to find tongue.\r\n\r\nPointing to the interior of the Corinthian gateway, with its walls and\r\nroof fashioned from the cedar of Libanus, he cried in a solemn tone:\r\n\r\n“The end of the temple hath come, for this is that which was spoken\r\nby the prophet, saying, ‘Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may\r\ndevour thy cedars!’”[12]\r\n\r\nAnd at that word “fire,” Berenice looked at Crispus and trembled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                        THE VENGEANCE OF FLORUS\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorus was in Jerusalem, and--sinister omen!--an armed legion with him.\r\n\r\nFollowing fast upon the dispatch of his letter demanding the seventeen\r\ntalents, he had taken up his abode in the old palace erected by Herod\r\nthe Great upon Mount Zion. This, as being the usual residence of\r\nthe procurators while at Jerusalem, had received the Roman name of\r\nPrætorium.\r\n\r\nIts two colossal wings of white marble, the Cæsareum and the Agrippeum,\r\nnamed respectively after Augustus and his great minister, were united\r\nby a long terrace, which, from its tesselated flooring, was called by\r\nthe Romans the Pavement, but by the Jews Gabbatha, or the Elevation.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the arrival of Florus, a vast concourse of Jewish\r\ncitizens assembled in front of this terrace when it became known that\r\nthe procurator had summoned the members of the Sanhedrim thither for\r\nthe purpose of interrogating them as to the riot that had taken place\r\nthree days previously.\r\n\r\nAmong those who came was the crafty Sadducean priest Ananias, who\r\nhoped, by reason of his private friendship with Florus, to dispose that\r\ntyrant to pacific measures.\r\n\r\nBeside him, glooming within himself, was his eldest son, the fierce,\r\ndark-browed Eleazar, captain of the temple, whose wrath was scarcely to\r\nbe restrained by the whispered admonitions of his more politic father.\r\n\r\nFlorus, disposed for reasons of his own to receive the Sanhedrim in the\r\nopen air, had given orders for his curule chair to be brought forth,\r\nand set down upon the Pavement midway between the two wings.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of this elevated tribunal and along its whole length\r\nglittered the brazen bucklers and crested helmets of the legionaries;\r\nthey flanked the walls of the two wings likewise, so that the whole\r\nmilitary force formed the three sides of a rectangle, the fourth being\r\nopen to the view of the public.\r\n\r\nThese troops were the Twentieth Legion, a force drawn, not like Rufus’\r\nItalic Cohort, from native Romans, but from the dregs of the Syrian\r\npopulace who were forced to a military service from which the Jew, by\r\nreason of his religion, was exempt. Hence the feeling of these troops\r\ntowards the Jewish nation was one of fierce hatred, a hatred that had\r\noften shown itself in deeds of blood. Let Florus give but the word and\r\nthey would not hesitate to massacre every man, woman, and child before\r\nthe tribunal.\r\n\r\nOn this particular morning, as they stood awaiting the coming of\r\nthe procurator, there was in their manner something so sinister and\r\nexpectant that a secret misgiving, a sense as of tragedy to come,\r\nseized upon many of the Sanhedrim.\r\n\r\nFlorus appeared at last, and contemptuously ignoring the fawning smiles\r\nof Ananias stalked to the curule chair, dark, haughty, frowning.\r\n\r\nThe herald called for silence, an unnecessary order, seeing that a\r\ndeath-like stillness had fallen upon the occupants both of Gabbatha and\r\nthe public square.\r\n\r\nFlorus’ mood was shown by his first question to the Sanhedrim.\r\n\r\n“Is it true that my person has been mocked by the youth of this city,\r\nwho have gone about, basket on arm, and crying aloud, ‘Give an obolus\r\nfor Florus the Pauper?’”\r\n\r\nThe members of the Sanhedrim looked at one another in alarm. Finally\r\nthey glanced at Ananias as if inviting him to be their spokesman.\r\n\r\nHiding both hands within the folds of his robe--an Oriental way of\r\nshowing respect and humility--and making a profound obeisance, Ananias\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n“O Florus, live forever----”\r\n\r\n(“Now heaven preserve us from that calamity!” muttered Eleazar.)\r\n\r\n“That certain youth _have_ behaved ill is but too true, and we cannot\r\ndeny it. But----”\r\n\r\nFlorus cut him short.\r\n\r\n“Ye see in me the representative of Cæsar----”\r\n\r\n“None more worthy to represent him, O Florus,” said Eleazar,\r\ncaustically.\r\n\r\n“And he who mocks me, mocks Cæsar,” continued the procurator with a\r\nside glance at Eleazar. “I therefore demand of you, the Sanhedrim, who\r\nare responsible for the due maintenance of order in this city, that\r\nthe youths who have affronted me be handed over here and now to be\r\ndealt with as their misdeeds deserve. And if ye fail to produce these\r\nmalefactors, know that for many days to come ye shall have a tale of\r\nsorrow to tell.”\r\n\r\nMiserable Sanhedrim! Among the elder of them were some who, thirty\r\nyears before, on an occasion never to be forgotten as long as time\r\nshall last, had said, and that, too, on the very spot where they\r\nwere now standing, “We have no king but Cæsar.” Thus had they made\r\ntheir choice. Verily, then, let them not repine if Cæsar, or his\r\nrepresentative, should treat them in a manner not according to their\r\nliking!\r\n\r\nThe hapless Ananias, collecting with difficulty his wits, which\r\nhad been somewhat scattered by Florus’ fierce air, stammered out a\r\ndeprecatory speech.\r\n\r\nWhat he said amounted to this: that the people were as a whole\r\npeaceably disposed; some few had done amiss, and for these let pardon\r\nbe granted, for it was no wonder that in so great a multitude there\r\nshould be some more daring than they ought to be, and by reason of\r\ntheir youth foolish also. It was, too, a very difficult matter to\r\ndistinguish the innocent from the guilty; and seeing that all alike,\r\nthose who had offended as well as those who had not, were sorry for\r\nwhat had happened, it would become the clemency of Florus to overlook\r\nthe affair, lest a too stern application of justice should bring about\r\ndisorders even more grave than those that had already taken place.\r\n\r\n“That last is in the nature of a threat!” exclaimed Florus fiercely.\r\n“Yours is just the sort of speech one would expect from a man who has\r\nplotted against the life of a Roman citizen,” he continued, with a\r\nfine forgetfulness of his own delinquencies. “Disorders more grave\r\nwill undoubtedly ensue, if the guilty are allowed to walk unpunished.\r\nSay without periphrases whether you will, or will not, give up these\r\nmalefactors.”\r\n\r\nAnanias hesitated, but Johanan ben Zacchai was bolder than the ex-high\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n“We cannot,” said he, “consent to give up these youths.”\r\n\r\nAt this there came a shout of approval from the people assembled before\r\nthe tribunal.\r\n\r\nFlorus glared at them for a moment, and then resumed:\r\n\r\n“And yet refuse to make a grant to Cæsar of seventeen talents from the\r\nCorban?”\r\n\r\n“Shall man rob God?” exclaimed Eleazar, fiercely. “This, too, we will\r\nnot do.”\r\n\r\nAgain a shout of applause, this time louder, from the populace. Florus\r\naccepted it for what it was meant, defiance of himself. Turning to the\r\ntroops in his rear, he cried:\r\n\r\n“Put these rebels to the rout. Plunder the Upper Market. Slay all who\r\noppose.”\r\n\r\nPlunder! What more agreeable order for the soldier? They required\r\nno second bidding. Like tigers suddenly let loose they raced across\r\nthe bema, sweeping the helpless Sanhedrim aside, and drawing their\r\ntrenchant broadswords they precipitated themselves upon the\r\ndefenseless people, striking out right and left, and using not the flat\r\nof the blade, but the point and edge.\r\n\r\nIt was all the work of a moment. Taken completely by surprise, and\r\nwithout arms to defend themselves, the front ranks, hideously gashed,\r\nsank moaning to the ground. The rest of the crowd, aghast at the sight,\r\nand suddenly realizing that a massacre was intended, strove to avoid\r\nthe Roman blades. But for those nearest the bema flight was impossible\r\nowing to the density of the throng. Then began a horrible struggle for\r\nlife; he who fell in that crowd never rose again, but was trampled\r\nto death, trampled out of all recognition; moved by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation everyone strove to thrust his body forward betwixt\r\nhis neighbors, or failing this, tried to drag his fellow back in the\r\nattempt to interpose something between himself and the terrible swords\r\nthat were steadily coming on from behind.\r\n\r\nWith the flight of those farthest from the bema, the mass became\r\ngradually loosened, and finally breaking into detached groups, fled in\r\nall directions, pursued by the shouting and triumphant legionaries.\r\n\r\nBut the Romans were not to have it all their own way. Many of the\r\nJews, escaping to the streets adjacent to the square, took refuge\r\nin the first houses they came to, and having barred the gates, they\r\nascended to the roofs and proceeded to assail the enemy below with\r\ntiles and stones. Others who had fled farther afield, procuring weapons\r\nor whatever implements might serve as such, retraced their steps, and\r\nfavored by their knowledge of the narrow and winding streets, ventured\r\nto give battle to the Romans, and what is more, contrived for a time to\r\nhold them in check.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Zion rang with the clang of arms, and the shouts of the\r\ncombatants.\r\n\r\nNews of what was happening came quickly to the ears of Berenice,\r\nproducing in her mind not only consternation, but an agonizing sense of\r\nself-reproach. She felt herself to be indirectly the cause of it all.\r\nIt was Florus’ revenge for her rejection of him. Her first impulse was\r\nto fly to the procurator, and appeal to him to stay his hand. Her pride\r\nrevolted from this step. But, as the sound of the fray grew louder and\r\nfiercer, she became more agitated; casting her pride away she resolved\r\nto hasten to his tribunal and intercede on behalf of her people.\r\n\r\nAs a royal princess, she deemed herself secure from molestation by the\r\nRoman soldiery; but, forgetful of the fact that she was unknown by\r\nsight to the majority of them, she ran forth from her palace without a\r\nsingle attendant. Fortunately she was seen by her master of the horse,\r\nwho, collecting as many of her household troops as he conveniently\r\ncould at a moment’s notice, went after her with all speed.\r\n\r\nOn coming within sight of the tribunal Berenice paused aghast.\r\nHell itself seemed to be let loose that day. The Jews, captured in\r\nthe neighboring streets, were being dragged into the square to be\r\nruthlessly slaughtered before the very eyes of Florus. No distinction\r\nwas made as to age or sex. Even infants, torn from the arms of\r\nshrieking mothers, were tossed aloft and caught upon the points of\r\nspears. Young girls, tied naked to stakes, were exposed to the brutal\r\njests of the soldiery, who offered their captives liberty if they would\r\nbut consent to taste a morsel of swine’s flesh.\r\n\r\nAs Berenice, with reeling brain, stepped forward, she caught sight of\r\na group of drunken soldiers, standing around a bright-eyed Jewish boy,\r\nwhose age could not have exceeded twelve years.\r\n\r\n“Tell us the name of your God?” exclaimed a soldier.\r\n\r\n“He is called the Lord,” answered the boy, nothing daunted by the ring\r\nof fierce faces around him.\r\n\r\n“Well, curse the Lord and you shall live,” said a second soldier,\r\nmenacing the lad with his spear.\r\n\r\nBut the little fellow had been too well drilled in the shibboleths of\r\nJudaism to do their bidding.\r\n\r\n“Cursed be all they that serve graven images,” he replied defiantly.\r\n\r\n“This wolfling will grow up into a brave wolf,” laughed the first\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n“That shall he not,” cried the second savagely; and, raising his pike\r\nwith both hands, he drove the weapon through the breast of the boy,\r\nwho, with the one word “Mother!” fell dead upon the spot.\r\n\r\n“O God!” gasped Berenice, “canst thou look on and let these men live?”\r\n\r\nScarcely able to move for horror, she made her way up the steps of the\r\nbema, and drew near to Florus. With hands clasped at the back of his\r\nneck, and with one leg thrown carelessly over the other, the procurator\r\nwas lolling at ease in his curule chair, amusing himself with the fears\r\nof a numerous body of richly-dressed captives, who were said, rightly\r\nor wrongly, by his spies, to be the very youths that, three days\r\nbefore, had gone about begging money for the indigent Florus.\r\n\r\n“By the way,” said he, “why don’t you Jews eat pork?”\r\n\r\nThe question drew loud laughter from the senseless soldiers standing by.\r\n\r\nOne of the captives ventured the remark that there were some nations\r\nthat did not eat lamb.\r\n\r\n“And they are quite right,” commented Florus. “Lamb is very insipid;\r\nbut pork--ah! that is one of the choicest delicacies the gods have\r\nconferred upon mankind, and I swear by Pluto that if ye will not eat of\r\nit ye shall die.”\r\n\r\n“Florus, in the name of God I adjure you to have pity upon these\r\nyouths,” cried Berenice. “Refrain from further bloodshed.”\r\n\r\nThe feeling of Florus was a strange mingling of love and hatred as\r\nhe beheld the distressed princess in all her wild beauty, her hair\r\nloosened, her feet bare.\r\n\r\nHis first mad impulse--he had been drinking heavily--was to clasp her\r\nin his arms and kiss her passionately regardless of the spectators; his\r\nnext, as he recalled her scornful language at Cæsarea, was to spurn her\r\nwith language equally scornful.\r\n\r\nHatred triumphed. He had gone too far now to recede, and since he could\r\nnot have the sweetness of love, he would have the sweetness of revenge.\r\n\r\nAmong the captives was a beautiful youth, whose unmistakable air of\r\nfearlessness had given secret umbrage to the procurator.\r\n\r\n“Marcus, you here?” cried Berenice in dismay. He was known to her as\r\nbeing a worshiper in the Royal Synagogue.\r\n\r\n“Fear not for me, princess. _I_ am safe.”\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence such as this moved Florus to a frenzy of wrath.\r\n\r\n“Lictors, crucify me this knave who considers himself so safe.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! no!” cried Berenice in an agony of grief.\r\n\r\nThe youth, with a proud smile, gave utterance to words that in every\r\nprovince of the empire, save one, had power to stay the hand of even\r\nCæsar himself:\r\n\r\n“CIVIS ROMANUS SUM--I am a Roman citizen!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! So _that_ is thy hope? Well, it shall not avail thee. A Roman\r\ncitizen? Pah! How easy to become such nowadays! Damas the Jew is a\r\nknave, but he has two oboli to spare; so the prætor touches him with a\r\nwand, twirls him round, and lo! Damas the Jew becomes Marcus the Roman,\r\nand struts about in a toga.”\r\n\r\nAnd here Florus, leaping up, illustrated his words by strutting about\r\nwith an air of mock dignity, amid the laughter of his satellites.\r\n\r\n“I am a freeborn Roman; nay, more--I am of equestrian rank.”\r\n\r\n“A knight--eh? Well, we’ll acknowledge thy dignity by giving thee a\r\nhigher cross and painting it purple. Lictors, bring hither a stock.”\r\n\r\nIn his mad desire to torment to the uttermost the soul of Berenice,\r\nFlorus did not hesitate to defy Roman law by an outrage so great that\r\nCicero confesses his inability to find a name for it. “It is an offense\r\nto bind a Roman citizen; a crime to scourge him; almost a parricide to\r\nkill him; what, then, shall I say of _crucifying_ him?”\r\n\r\nSuch an outrage on the part of a Roman governor might be deemed\r\nincredible were it not attested by a contemporary historian.\r\n\r\n“Florus,” says Josephus, “dared to do what no governor before his time\r\nhad ever done--to have men of the equestrian order scourged and nailed\r\nto the cross in front of his tribunal, who, although they were Jews by\r\nbirth, were yet of Roman dignity notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nDesirous of adding not so much to the agony of Marcus as to that of\r\nBerenice, Florus, with a cruel smile, issued a fresh order.\r\n\r\n“Hold! before crucifying the knave we’ll scourge him.”\r\n\r\nA strange thing is the heart of a woman! Berenice, who had been willing\r\nto subject a young girl to scourging, now shuddered when a similar\r\ntorture was proposed for a young man.\r\n\r\nAs for the victim himself, vainly did he urge his legal right to be\r\ntransferred from the tribunal of Florus to that of Nero.\r\n\r\n“_Appello Cæsarem_--I appeal unto Cæsar,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Cæsar’s a long way off,” laughed Florus. “In Greece, playing the fool.\r\nYou’ll have to shout a good deal louder, if he’s to hear you.”\r\n\r\nDeaf to his protests, the lictors stripped the youth of his garments\r\nand tied his wrists to a column. He tried to be brave, but where is\r\nthe man that _could_ be brave when subjected to the strokes of the\r\n“_horrible flagellum_”?\r\n\r\nA thrilling scream burst from Marcus’ lips as the leathern thongs,\r\nweighted with triangular pieces of lead, descended upon his naked,\r\nquivering flesh.\r\n\r\n“O Apollo! How sweet a voice!” cried Florus mockingly. “By the gods,\r\nNero must look to his laurels, for he hath a rival. Give him a second\r\nstroke. Ah! a higher note this time. Swing the flagellum again. We’ll\r\nrun him through the whole octave.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the captives, apprehensive of the same fate, looked on with\r\nblanched cheeks and terror-stricken eyes.\r\n\r\nBerenice’s distress of mind made her look like some wild thing. Her\r\nmanifest agony was a luxury to the soul of Florus.\r\n\r\n“There are twenty of these youths,” he whispered, “and they shall all\r\nsuffer the same fate, scourging and crucifixion. But you can save them,\r\nif you will.”\r\n\r\n“How?” gasped Berenice.\r\n\r\nFlorus’ whispered reply was of a character so infamous that the\r\nindignant princess raised her hand and struck her open palm against his\r\ncheek; struck, too, with all her force.\r\n\r\nSmarting with the pain, Florus started back with a very ugly look upon\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“Guards, remove this woman from the bema. What hath she to do with\r\nthese matters?”\r\n\r\nAnd the rough soldiery, paying little respect either to her womanhood\r\nor to her rank, drove her down the steps of the tribunal.[13]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNight fell, calm and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe Syrian stars looked down upon the tribunal, whose stones, could\r\nthey have spoken, might have told how, thirty years before, a wicked\r\npopulace had cried, “_His blood be on us, and on our children!_”\r\n\r\nThat self-invoked curse was working out its fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThere, on the very spot where those words had been uttered, stood a\r\nmultitude of crosses, each lifting a ghastly victim to the midnight sky!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                       “TO YOUR TENTS, O ISRAEL!”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the massacre instigated by Florus, a massacre that numbered no\r\nless than three thousand six hundred victims, Crispus, by nature of the\r\ncase, had been compelled to look helplessly on.\r\n\r\nSide with the Roman troops he could not; to side with the Jews would\r\nhave been unpatriotic. His attempt at mediation met, like that of\r\nBerenice, with an insulting repulse from the procurator. Burning with\r\nindignation, he retired to the Turris Antonia and addressed to his\r\nfather a letter describing the disgrace that had been brought upon the\r\nRoman name by Florus, and urging the Legate to come at once with a\r\nlegion and restore order in Jerusalem by the only method possible, the\r\ndeposition of the wicked procurator. This letter, when finished, he\r\ndispatched to Antioch by the hand of a swift courier.\r\n\r\nFlorus, having given ample ground for rebellion, proceeded, in\r\npursuance of the same sinister policy, to take his departure,\r\nwithdrawing all his troops save one cohort, and that a divided one,\r\nhalf being allotted to the Prætorium, and half to Antonia.\r\n\r\nNever did the baseness of Florus’ character appear more than in this,\r\nthe final act of his official career. He knew that, in the present\r\nexcited state of the city, garrisons so slender would offer an\r\nirresistible temptation to the seditious. But what cared he for the\r\nRomans whom he was leaving behind? If the garrisons were massacred,\r\nwhy, so much the better for his purpose.\r\n\r\nAs Florus looked back upon the city he was leaving he might have said\r\nwith a nobler Roman than himself, “Mischief, thou art afoot; take what\r\ncourse thou wilt.”[14]\r\n\r\nAmong the troops ordered to leave Jerusalem upon this occasion was\r\nthe Italian Cohort of Rufus, who, however great his dislike of the\r\nprocurator, had, as a loyal soldier, no other course than to do as he\r\nwas bidden.\r\n\r\nCrispus, determined to remain in the city, betook himself to the\r\nPrætorium, and offered his services to its commandant Metilius, who was\r\nglad to welcome any auxiliary, and especially one like Crispus, whose\r\nsuggestions for the defense of the palace were not only original, but,\r\nwhat is more, practicable.\r\n\r\nTo Metilius’ lament that, owing to the lack of the requisite missiles,\r\nthe balistæ and other machines of like character would have to remain\r\nidle, Crispus laughingly replied:\r\n\r\n“If it comes to that, we can discharge these statues upon the heads of\r\nthe mob.”\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the time in a magnificent hall decorated with\r\nsculpture, and, happening to cast a casual eye over the marble\r\nmasterpieces around him, was so much attracted by one of them that he\r\nwalked up to it and examined it with an attention that set Metilius\r\nwondering.\r\n\r\nThe statue represented a beautiful maiden clothed to the feet in\r\na graceful stole. Upon the pedestal was sculptured the one word,\r\n_Pythodoris_.\r\n\r\n“Pythodoris?” murmured Crispus. “Were not that name graven here I\r\nshould have called it Vashti.”\r\n\r\nFor indeed, the statue, both in face and figure, was so like the Hebrew\r\nmaiden that anyone acquainted with her might very well have supposed\r\nthat it was intended for no other person.\r\n\r\n“Pythodoris?” said Crispus reflectively. “The name is new to me. Who is\r\nshe, or perhaps I ought to say, who was she?”\r\n\r\nMetilius confessed himself unable to satisfy the curiosity of Crispus.\r\nHe, too, had never heard the name.\r\n\r\n“This much I know about the statue,” remarked he; “that it is a recent\r\naddition to this gallery, and was, I believe, a gift of King Polemo.”\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Pontic king’s name added not a little to\r\nCrispus’ perplexity.\r\n\r\n“The lady evidently is, or was, a queen,” observed Metilius, pointing\r\nto the Oriental diadem upon the head of the figure.\r\n\r\nSurveying the statue more closely, Crispus saw engraved upon the sandal\r\nin minute letters, ΛΑΣΟΣ ΕΠΟΙΕΙ.\r\n\r\n“‘The workmanship of Lasus,’” said he, reading the name of a sculptor\r\nwell known at the beginning of the first century. “’Tis fifty years ago\r\nsince he died, so we may conclude that this is the image of a queen no\r\nlonger living. How to account for her resemblance to Vashti? But,” he\r\nadded suddenly, cutting the matter short, “we do wrong to stand musing\r\nhere, when there are graver matters to attend to.”\r\n\r\nHerein Crispus spoke truly. The seditiously-disposed among the Jews had\r\nnoted with secret joy that Florus had left the city all but denuded of\r\ntroops. What could the two slender garrisons of three hundred each do\r\nagainst the whole city? To neglect such a golden opportunity for the\r\nrecovery of freedom was a contravening of the will of Elohim, who must\r\nsurely have brought about this arrangement for the good of the holy\r\nseed.\r\n\r\nDay by day affairs grew more threatening; in the temple-courts and\r\nin the synagogues, fiery Zealots from the mountains, and wild-eyed\r\nprophets from the desert, declared to the credulous multitude that all\r\nthe signs of the times pointed to the near advent of the long-promised\r\nMessiah, when the Jewish nation should not only be free, but should\r\nreign supreme over all the children of the earth from the rising of\r\nthe sun to the setting thereof.\r\n\r\nVainly did Agrippa and Berenice seek to deter the infatuated populace\r\nfrom a course certain to end in the ruin of the Jewish state.\r\n\r\n“To your tents, O Israel!” was the answer of the Zealots. “What\r\ndealings have we with Cæsar, or what is our portion in Rome?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was eventide, and the silver trumpets were sounding the signal for\r\nthe closing of the temple-gates, as two figures mounted the stairs\r\nleading to the roof of Solomon’s Colonnade.\r\n\r\nThe one was Eleazar, the captain of the temple, the other Simon of\r\nGerasa, who, during several days, had been living in a secret chamber\r\nof the sanctuary; for Eleazar could not refuse the right of asylum to a\r\npatriot whose stores of wealth, acquired by brigandage, had always been\r\nsent by secret and devious methods to the temple treasury.\r\n\r\nAs the two paced the roof they talked, and seldom in the history of the\r\nworld has talk been more momentous in its consequences.\r\n\r\n“The people are ripe for war,” said Eleazar with a fierce, exultant\r\nsmile. “We’ll set them to attack the garrisons in Antonia and the\r\nPrætorium.”\r\n\r\n“Whence shall we obtain the necessary arms?”\r\n\r\n“You know Masada?” asked Eleazar.\r\n\r\nIt would indeed have been strange if Simon had not known the name,\r\nat least, of the famous stronghold, emphatically named Masada--“THE\r\nFORTRESS”--built by Jonathan Maccabæus upon a precipitous cliff,\r\nfifteen hundred feet in height, overhanging the waters of the Dead Sea,\r\na fastness in which the treasures of Jerusalem had been deposited for\r\nsecurity during the troubled times of the Asamonean monarchy.\r\n\r\n“It contains arms for ten thousand men,” continued Eleazar.\r\n\r\n“With a Roman garrison to guard them.”\r\n\r\n“Tush! the garrison is but a slender one, and, aware of this, I have\r\nsent off a band to attack the place.”\r\n\r\nSimon received this startling news with a grim joy.\r\n\r\n“’Tis a declaration of war,” remarked he.\r\n\r\n“’Tis meant for such. One must make a beginning.”\r\n\r\n“But Masada!” remonstrated Simon. “Art mad? The fortress is\r\nimpregnable.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore the more easily surprised. An impregnable fortress\r\nalways renders its garrison careless.”\r\n\r\n“Who heads this daring expedition?”\r\n\r\n“Manahem, the son of Judas of Galilee.”\r\n\r\n“The traitor who bought from Florus the license to plunder!” exclaimed\r\nSimon wrathfully; for he and Manahem had long been jealous rivals.\r\n\r\n“Shall I repel a man who offers me his services?” answered Eleazar.\r\n“Four nights ago he descended from the mountains with his guerilla\r\nband, and sought me out, bidding me tell him to do something for the\r\ncause. I bade him go and take Masada.”\r\n\r\n“If he succeed, he will indeed be a Manahem,” sneered Simon, playing\r\nupon his rival’s name, which in Hebrew signifies Comforter.\r\n\r\nOverhead hung a dark-blue firmament sparkling with stars, by whose\r\nlight the nearer hills that “stand round about Jerusalem” were clearly\r\nvisible; beyond them, appearing far off on the horizon, was the mount\r\nknown from old time as Beth-haccerem, whose conspicuous peak had marked\r\nit as a suitable station for signaling tidings to Jerusalem by that\r\nprimitive mode of telegraph, the beacon-fire.\r\n\r\nEleazar’s eyes were set upon Beth-haccerem, and Simon, following his\r\ncompanion’s gaze, was surprised to see a light springing into being\r\nupon the dark summit of the distant peak. No evanescent flash, but\r\na light that continued to sparkle and glow; evidently a signal, the\r\nmeaning of which was known to the priest, if one must judge by the\r\nsatisfaction that gleamed from his dark countenance.\r\n\r\n“Sooner than I durst hope,” he murmured. “The impregnable fortress has\r\nfallen.”\r\n\r\n“_Masada?_” gasped Simon with a mingled feeling of amazement and\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\n“So is yon light to be interpreted,” replied Eleazar. “The armory of\r\nMasada is now in our hands, and to-morrow a train of wagons will come\r\nrolling towards Jerusalem laden with weapons for the people.”\r\n\r\n“How will your father and the Sanhedrim take this deed of yours?”\r\n\r\n“Leave me to deal with them,” replied Eleazar with a hard smile.\r\n\r\nOn the next day a meeting of the Sanhedrim was convened by Matthias,\r\nthe high priest, for the purpose of considering the course to be\r\nobserved by that body, should the common people persist in their\r\noutspoken determination to take up arms against the Romans.\r\n\r\nAt this gathering--held in the temple within the walls of the famous\r\n_Lishcath Ha-Gazith_ or Hall of Squares, so named from its checkered\r\npavement--Eleazar came out with a new and startling proposition, upon\r\nwhich he desired a vote should be taken.\r\n\r\n“It hath been the custom in our temple since the days of Herod,” said\r\nhe, “to offer daily a sacrifice for the safety and welfare of the\r\nreigning Cæsar. But why should we pray for our enemy? why pray for an\r\nuncircumcized heathen? why pray for Nero, who in claiming Divine honors\r\ninsults the name of the Most High? In praying that the life of this\r\nblasphemer may be prolonged, what are we doing but praying for the\r\ncontinuance of blasphemy? Brethren and fathers, this must not be. My\r\nvoice is that from to-day the sacrifice for Cæsar shall cease.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Eleazar had resumed his seat, Ananias rose to oppose the\r\ndaring innovation propounded by his son.\r\n\r\n“However agreeable this proposal may be to our secret inclination,”\r\nsaid he, “the question for us is, in what light would Nero regard\r\nit, for it will not escape his knowledge. He would take it as an\r\naffront--nay, more, as a declaration of war.”\r\n\r\n“Let him take it as such,” said Eleazar, boldly.\r\n\r\n“Now you reveal your true aim,” answered Ananias, “which is to act as\r\na mover of sedition. You would have the Sanhedrim declare war against\r\nRome.”\r\n\r\n“War is certain to come--nay, is here now--and there is no other course\r\nleft for the Sanhedrim but to side with the multitude in their struggle\r\nfor liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Not so,” cried some, loudest among them being Ananias.\r\n\r\n“O then, you will fight on the side of the Romans--a noble act for\r\npatriotic Jews!”\r\n\r\n“There is a third course--to remain neutral,” said Simeon ben Gamaliel.\r\n\r\n“That way death lies. The people--the fight once begun--will have no\r\nneutrals among them. Their cry will be, ‘He that is not with us is\r\nagainst us.’”\r\n\r\n“We can leave Jerusalem,” said Johanan ben Zacchai. “Not without\r\ncutting yourself off from God. The sacrifices through which He is alone\r\naccessible--can they be offered anywhere but in that place where He\r\nhas chosen to put His name? Dare we as priests live apart from the\r\ntemple? No! And, since we cannot prevent the war, we must seek to guide\r\nits course by putting ourselves at the head of the national movement,\r\nunless we would see ourselves set aside and relegated to obscurity,\r\nand even, it may be, given over to prison and to death. It is clear\r\nthat----”\r\n\r\nBut at this point the council, at the instigation of Ananias, lifted up\r\ntheir voices in dissent, so loud and so prolonged, that the orator was\r\ncompelled to come to an end.\r\n\r\nAt the first lull, Ananias bade Matthias put the question to the vote,\r\nand, this being done, the proposition for the abolition of the Cæsarean\r\nsacrifice was defeated by a considerable majority.\r\n\r\n“So ends your treason!” sneered Ananias, addressing his son.\r\n\r\nEleazar rose, somewhat pale, but with a defiant smile on his lips.\r\n\r\n“The vote is of no consequence----” he began.\r\n\r\n“Hark to him!” cried Ananias.\r\n\r\n“As captain of the temple, I decree that from to-day no more sacrifices\r\nshall be offered on behalf of Cæsar.”\r\n\r\n“And how will you effect your decree?” laughed Ananias.\r\n\r\n“Why, thus,” replied Eleazar coolly, placing a ram’s horn to his lips,\r\nand blowing one sharp, shrill note.\r\n\r\nAt that sound every door opening into the hall Gazith flew wide\r\nrevealing a sudden blaze of arms. Then, marching with slow and majestic\r\npace, there filed into the chamber a tall and stately band of Nethinim\r\nclad in glittering mail. Moving with admirable order, they ranged\r\nthemselves along the four walls of the chamber, and then stood, shield\r\nand spear at their back, as silent and motionless as statues.\r\n\r\nThese Nethinim formed a part of the temple guards, servants of Eleazar,\r\nwho, independently of their oath of obedience to their captain, were\r\nfor other reasons devotedly attached to his person. Whatever he should\r\nbid them do, that would they do.\r\n\r\nAnd what was his bidding to be? The silent Sanhedrim waited in wonder,\r\nindignation, fear.\r\n\r\n“The vote of to-day has taught me,” said Eleazar, “who are the friends\r\nand who are the foes of Israel. Let those who are on my side,” he\r\ncontinued, “move to the right.”\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted by not more than a dozen members, among\r\nthem being Matthias the President, and Simeon ben Gamaliel.\r\n\r\n“From to-day,” continued Eleazar, “the temple becomes the seat of\r\na holy war, the abode of the Lord’s host, a citadel in the service\r\nof freedom. Henceforth, its gates open only to the true worshipers\r\nof Israel, whose foes ye are,” he added, turning to his Sanhedrist\r\nopponents. “Withdraw, ere the scourges of the Nethinim quicken your\r\nsteps.”\r\n\r\nThe fierce storm of indignant protest that burst from Ananias and his\r\nparty met with a savage laugh from Eleazar.\r\n\r\n“You dare threaten us with expulsion from the temple?” cried Ananias,\r\nhis eyes blazing with wrath.\r\n\r\n“This is no place for the friends of Cæsar. What! ye will not budge?\r\nGuards, drive these traitors forth.”\r\n\r\nAs if the command were a joy to them, the Nethinim rushed forward,\r\nat the same time drawing forth scourges and whips which they applied\r\nwithout more ado to the bodies of the immovable Sanhedrists.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a strange scene. From the Sanhedrim came screams of pain\r\nand fierce protests, undignified scufflings and even oaths.\r\n\r\nTheir feeble resistance was soon overborne; without weapons, and\r\ninferior in numbers and strength to their more youthful opponents, they\r\nwere thrust forth from the Hall of Squares, and driven across the wide\r\ncourt of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nA sight so unusual at once attracted the attention of the multitude,\r\nwho were at first disposed to side with the struggling Sanhedrim,\r\nbut the magical words, “Friends of the Romans,” quickly turned their\r\nsympathies into the opposite scale, so that they readily joined the\r\nNethinim in the work of expulsion; and the end of it all was that the\r\nvenerable fathers found themselves outside the temple, indignant and\r\nbreathless, disheveled and bleeding.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consultation, they took their way across the Tyropæon\r\nBridge to the Upper City, and entered the palace of Ananias. From its\r\nflat roof they could see something of what was passing in the temple.\r\nEvery part of the holy house was glittering with arms. Eleazar was\r\nmaking good his word; the temple was being garrisoned, in the interests\r\nnot of Rome, but of Israel.\r\n\r\nAware of the hatred with which his pro-Roman sympathies were regarded\r\nby the mob, Ananias, in conjunction with a large body of Jewish\r\nloyalists, deemed it prudent, before the day was out, to take refuge\r\nwith the soldiers in the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nLate that same night, Berenice escorted by a small retinue made her\r\nway to this palace; and, while her guards waited without, she herself\r\nentered to take a farewell of Crispus.\r\n\r\nShe came with startling tidings. Simon the Black was in the city,\r\nand, resorting to a master-stroke of policy, had freed all the poor\r\ndebtors--and they were a very numerous body in Jerusalem--by persuading\r\nthem to set fire to the Archeion in Ophel, the building in which\r\nwere registered all monetary loans contracted by private citizens,\r\nsuch official registration constituting the only legal proof of the\r\ntransaction. Having thus involved the multitude in an irrevocable act\r\nof sedition, Simon had next led them forth to Olivet, where the Zealots\r\nof Manahem, returning in triumph from the conquest of Masada, were now\r\nengaged, by the torches’ glare, in making a free distribution of arms\r\nto all who were willing to fight.\r\n\r\nWith signs of the liveliest agitation, the princess told how it was the\r\nintention of the mob on the following morning to storm the two Roman\r\nstrongholds, and massacre the garrisons by way of retaliation for the\r\nbutchery wrought by Florus.\r\n\r\n“Will you not leave the city with me, ere it be too late?” she asked of\r\nCrispus in earnest tones.\r\n\r\n“’Tis not the fashion of Romans to desert their post, however numerous\r\nthe foe,” returned Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Your departure will not be desertion, for no one has ordered _you_ to\r\nfight. Your station here is a voluntary one.”\r\n\r\n“I will not leave my fellow-countrymen to their fate! That your people\r\nhave good cause for insurrection is, alas! but too true. But, for all\r\nthat, my way is clear. I am a patriot and a Cestius, and it is my duty\r\nto keep the Roman eagle supreme in this city, or die in the attempt.”\r\n\r\nBerenice was silent for a moment; then, laying her hand upon his arm,\r\nshe said in tender tones:\r\n\r\n“Let me stay here to help you; you may become wounded, and who is there\r\nto nurse you? And if you die, which heaven forbid, I--I will die with\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nCrispus could not but be touched with this expression of sympathy\r\non her part. Forgetting the incident in the synagogue, he felt that\r\nhe could love her, if she were always like this. And as he had\r\nonce thought Vashti’s face to be like Berenice’s, so now did he\r\nthink Berenice’s face like Vashti’s, as he beheld it at this moment\r\ntransfigured with a beautiful and heroic light.\r\n\r\n“Princess, this is no place for you,” said he gently.\r\n\r\nHe conducted the reluctant and sorrowful Berenice to her palanquin at\r\nthe palace gate. As he parted from her some tempting spirit bade him\r\nwhisper tenderly:\r\n\r\n“Farewell, _Athenaïs_.”\r\n\r\nHe might not have pronounced that name had he foreseen its effect.\r\nHer sweet and lovable expression vanished in a moment, to be replaced\r\nby a cold, suspicious look that repelled him as much as the other had\r\nattracted.\r\n\r\n“Why do you call me by that name?” she asked, seeming to shrink from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I am trying an experiment, princess,” said he, significantly.\r\n\r\nEvidently it was an experiment that did not please Berenice. She looked\r\nfor all the world like a woman detected in a secret. With a glance\r\nthat might be interpreted as one almost of fear, she sank back on the\r\ncushions of the palanquin, and, without another word to him, gave the\r\norder for the bearers to proceed.\r\n\r\nIn pensive mood, Crispus watched her departure. Whether she were\r\nAthenaïs, or whether she were not, it was difficult to see why the\r\nsimple mention of the name should act so strangely upon her. That he\r\nhad not lost her favor, however, was evidenced by the arrival, during\r\nthe night, of three thousand Jewish cavalry. They were the troops of\r\nKing Agrippa, and had been sent by him to bring his sister safely out\r\nof the troubled city; meeting them on the way, Berenice had bidden\r\nthem go on to the help of the little garrison in the Prætorium. It can\r\nreadily be imagined how gladly these new auxiliaries were welcomed\r\nby Metilius, but when Crispus suggested that one-half of them should\r\nproceed to Antonia, Darius, the master of the horse, declined, on the\r\nground that the princess’ orders were that he should fight for the\r\nPrætorium only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                              “VÆ VICTIS!”\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the Zealot chief Manahem, who, with his followers,\r\nhad camped during the night upon Olivet, descended that mount, and,\r\nseated upon a chariot, entered the city with an air of pomp and state\r\nthat moved the spleen of Eleazar, as he watched the procession from the\r\nroof of the temple-cloisters.\r\n\r\n“Is this fellow a king?” said he. “Will he reign at Jerusalem?”\r\n\r\nManahem was welcomed with enthusiastic acclamation by the newly-armed\r\npopulace, who demanded that he should at once lead them against\r\nAntonia, fully believing that he who had taken Masada would have no\r\ndifficulty in taking a similar fortress. Manahem could not decline this\r\ntask without risking his character for bravery; so, after plundering\r\nand burning the deserted palaces of Agrippa and Ananias, he advanced\r\nat the head of a tumultuous and disorderly throng towards the Turris\r\nAntonia, where, having procured silence, he--in very bad Latin--called\r\nupon the commandant to surrender the fortress.\r\n\r\n“I am a Roman.”\r\n\r\nAnd the officer, deeming that answer sufficient, disdained to give any\r\nother.\r\n\r\n“So was he who held Masada,” replied the Zealot chief, giving the\r\nsignal for the attack.\r\n\r\nAll day long under Manahem’s leadership a fierce fight raged round the\r\nfortress, but when night fell, the Jews had nothing to show for their\r\nfiery valor except their heavy tale of dead and dying.\r\n\r\nManahem’s wrath, arising from his failure, was enhanced by the\r\nremark of Simon, who, out of jealousy, had refrained from helping his\r\nbrother-chief.\r\n\r\n“You have caused the holy seed to be massacred.”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt captain them thyself to-morrow,” said Manahem.\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” replied the Black Zealot calmly.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the multitude had again assembled for war Simon thus\r\naddressed them:\r\n\r\n“Let him who had father or mother, son or daughter, killed in the day\r\nof Florus come forward.”\r\n\r\nImmediately hundreds of men pushed their way to the front.\r\n\r\n“Behold the men who killed them!” cried Simon, pointing with his sword\r\nto the fortress.\r\n\r\nThis lie, for such it was--the garrison having taken no part whatever\r\nin the massacre--had a telling effect upon the crowd, filling them with\r\nnew fire and new fury. Led on by Simon in person, they rushed forward\r\nwith the scaling-ladders and planted them against the walls, though\r\nit was only to be driven back again. For many hours the battle raged;\r\nnineteen times repulsed, they returned with spirit unabated to the\r\nattack; at the twentieth assault, which took place towards the close of\r\nthe day, the Jews succeeded in effecting an entrance.\r\n\r\n“Leave not one alive!” was their cry. “Did they spare us and our little\r\nones?”\r\n\r\nThe little garrison, faced by overwhelming numbers, bravely maintained\r\nthe honor of the Roman name; with never a thought of asking for\r\nquarter, they fought doggedly on, “each stepping where his comrade\r\nfell,” till the blade glimmered in the grasp of the last man.\r\n\r\nThe standard that on the loftiest tower had so long flaunted before\r\nJewish eyes the hateful letters S.P.Q.R., was hauled down and torn to\r\nshreds.\r\n\r\nThus fell, after two days’ hard fighting, the great fortress of\r\nAntonia, an event that gave little pleasure to the victor of Masada,\r\nwhen he heard the people saying that night, “Manahem hath slain his\r\nthousands, but Simon his ten thousands!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“To the Prætorium!” was the cry of the multitude next morning.\r\n\r\nManahem resumed his command; and, mounted on a prancing horse and\r\nfollowed by shouting crowds, he advanced to the open space fronting\r\nGabbatha, and in a loud voice called for the surrender of the palace.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this was an arrow, which, as intended, went clean through\r\nthe crest of Manahem’s helmet.\r\n\r\n“Your heart next time,” said Metilius, “if you again propose treason to\r\na Roman.”\r\n\r\nManahem, swearing by Urim and by Thummim that the defenders of the\r\nPrætorium should meet with the same fate as those of Masada and\r\nAntonia, moved off to a quarter, whence, shielded from the missiles of\r\nthe enemy, he could direct the operations of the siege.\r\n\r\nThe most pitiable object in the Prætorium at this time was Ananias. He\r\nhad ventured to look forth from a window, and the crowd, recognizing\r\nhim, yelled out their fierce hatred of the Sadducean hierarch, loudest\r\namong the shouters being priests themselves, whose words soon showed\r\nthe cause of their fury.\r\n\r\n“Who sent his servants round to collect the priests’ tithes, and\r\nbludgeoned those that would not pay? Who but Ananias?”\r\n\r\n“Who, when he had got the tithes, kept them to spend upon the harlot\r\nAsenath, so that many priests died for want? Who but Ananias?”\r\n\r\nBefore his terrified gaze they paraded the gory head of the Antonian\r\ncommandant fixed upon the point of a lofty pike.\r\n\r\n“Thus shall it be with thy head,” they cried.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour Ananias had the air of a man haunted with the certainty\r\nof coming down. With melancholy countenance, he wandered aimlessly\r\nthrough the splendid halls of the Prætorium, trembling at the din of\r\nbattle outside its walls, and expecting at every moment to witness the\r\nfearful inrush of fierce-eyed, saber-brandishing Zealots, all athirst\r\nfor his blood. His cowardice moved even his Jewish friends to contempt.\r\n\r\n“Ananias, thy face is like a whited wall,” laughed one.\r\n\r\nA whited wall! Those words troubled him for the rest of the day,\r\nreviving, as they did, a saying that had long since passed from his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n“_God shall smite thee, thou whited wall_: for sittest thou to judge me\r\nafter the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?”[15]\r\n\r\nWhence, and from whom, came these words? Evidently from some prisoner\r\nbefore his judgment-seat, whom he had ordered to be struck.\r\n\r\nYes; he remembered now; it was the indignant utterance of Paul of\r\nTarsus--that Paul whose life he had sought to take by the daggers of\r\nthe Zealots. And now, by the irony of a divine Nemesis, the daggers of\r\nthese same Zealots were seeking to take _his_ life!\r\n\r\nWere there no secret chambers, he wailed, where one could hide? He had\r\nheard that Herod, in building this palace, had constructed such. Would\r\nno one point them out? But all were too busy with the siege to attend\r\nto his plaint.\r\n\r\nThat siege was conducted with cool skill on the part of the Romans, and\r\nwith undisciplined fury on that of the Jews, who with that fanatical\r\nfrenzy peculiar to Orientals, did not hesitate to fling their naked\r\nbodies upon the Roman pikes in the vain attempt to force a way into the\r\nPrætorium.\r\n\r\nEvery device known to the warfare of that age was tried by the\r\nJews--escalade and fiery arrows, battering-ram and secret mining--tried\r\nand made of none effect by the vigilance and ingenuity of Crispus. He,\r\nfar more than Metilius, was the life and soul of the garrison, even as\r\nSimon proved himself more resourceful and valiant than his captain\r\nManahem, who chose for the most part to sit still in a safe place,\r\npaying out five golden pieces for every Roman head brought to him.\r\n\r\nKing Agrippa’s cavalry did excellent service at the first. Sallying\r\nforth at unexpected times they scattered the mob with their furious\r\ncharges, and, sweeping the streets clear of the besiegers, they rode\r\ntriumphantly round and round the palace. But Simon soon found a remedy\r\nfor these tactics by sprinkling the ground with steel calthrops that\r\nlamed the horses and brought down the riders. After this the cavalry\r\nrefused to make any more sallies. Simon marked their flagging zeal, and\r\nwas quick to turn it to his own advantage. By the mouth of a herald he\r\nproclaimed that the Jewish defenders of the Prætorium should have full\r\nliberty to march out of the city with their arms and effects; some few,\r\nhowever, were to be exempted from this privilege, Ananias being one\r\nof the number. To his eternal disgrace, Darius, master of Agrippa’s\r\nhorse, accepted these terms; Metilius, owing to the paucity of his own\r\nband, was unable to prevent this defection, and accordingly, on the\r\ntwenty-first morning of the siege, the Jewish contingent began to file\r\nthrough the front gate of the Prætorium, amid the jeers and curses of\r\nthose whom they were leaving to their fate.\r\n\r\nDeath had reduced the number of the Romans to two hundred and fifty;\r\nand, as it was impossible with so small a force to defend the whole\r\ncircuit of the Prætorium, Metilius seized the opportunity while\r\nthe eyes of the Zealots were fastened upon the outgoing Jewish\r\ntroops to withdraw quietly and quickly to the three great towers of\r\nMariamne, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, erected by Herod the Great, and\r\nrespectively dedicated to the memory of his wife, his brother, and\r\nhis friend--towers situated upon the city-wall, which, at this point,\r\nformed in itself the northern and western sides of the Prætorium.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of military architecture, antiquity had nothing to show\r\nmore marvelous than these three towers. Each stood upon a base of stone\r\nwithout any chamber or vacuity in it, the base of Mariamne forming\r\na solid cube of thirty feet, that of Phasaelus forty, and that of\r\nHippicus sixty. The battering-ram was powerless against these enormous\r\nblocks, compacted with unequaled perfection, and bound together by iron\r\ncramps.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots, quickly discovering that the Prætorium had been abandoned\r\nby its defenders, entered, and a wild scene ensued. Never remarkable\r\nfor discipline or for subserviency to their chiefs, they wrangled\r\nfiercely over the spoil, even to the extent of drawing swords upon\r\neach other. Upon one point, however, all were agreed--namely, that the\r\nbeautiful sculptures adorning this old Herodian palace were a violation\r\nof the Second Commandment, and an insult to the Jewish religion.\r\n\r\n“Idols!” they screamed.\r\n\r\nMaking no distinction between the statues of mortals and those of gods,\r\nthey called for hammer and mallet, and broke all alike to pieces.\r\n\r\n“Vashti’s image among the rest, I suppose,” muttered Crispus, as he\r\nwatched the work of destruction. “I would have given much to preserve\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe next day two Zealots, who had been exploring every corner of the\r\ndismantled palace, emerged with a shout, leading captive an old man. It\r\nwas Ananias, who had lain during the night concealed in a subterranean\r\naqueduct.\r\n\r\nMore dead than alive, the trembling priest, who had once held despotic\r\nsway in Jerusalem, was hauled amid contumely and blows to the presence\r\nof Manahem, who received him with a smile of savage satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“What shall be done to this friend of the Romans? this traitor to\r\nhis country?” said he, affecting to ask the advice of Simon, whom he\r\nsecretly hated, yet dared not hurt.\r\n\r\nAnd herein Simon behaved in very subtle fashion, for wishing Ananias\r\nto die, yet suspecting that if he said as much, Manahem, out of sheer\r\nopposition, would adopt a contrary course, he made answer:\r\n\r\n“Let him live.”\r\n\r\nIt was with a malicious smile that Manahem replied:\r\n\r\n“It is my will that he dies.”\r\n\r\nAnd at his nod two Zealots buried their daggers deep in the breast of\r\nthe one-time high priest.[16]\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards Simon was in the temple-court conversing with\r\nEleazar.\r\n\r\n“Thy sire is dead.”\r\n\r\nEleazar was startled, and to some extent grieved. Filial sentiment\r\nwas not altogether dead in him, in spite of his recent quarrel with\r\nAnanias, and on learning how the latter had died, he exclaimed fiercely:\r\n\r\n“God do so to me and more also if I make not the end of Manahem as the\r\nend of Ananias!”\r\n\r\nThe arrogant Manahem, unconscious of the forces secretly working\r\nagainst him, now entered upon a course that brought him to ruin.\r\n\r\nIn the sack of the Prætorium he had come across a purple robe and a\r\ngolden crown, both belonging formerly to Herod the Great, and, putting\r\nthese emblems of royalty upon himself, he began to assume the air of a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nLeaving a strong force to watch the towers, Manahem, regally attired,\r\nmarched with the rest of his followers to the temple, declaring his\r\npurpose to be a religious one; he came to offer a sacrifice as a means\r\nof obtaining further victories.\r\n\r\nBut Eleazar, suspecting that his design was to gain possession of\r\nthe temple-fortress, without which Manahem could never be master of\r\nthe city, closed the gates, set every available Levite on guard, and\r\nrefused admission to the Zealot chief.\r\n\r\nAnd now arose a dissension among the followers of Manahem; some were\r\nfor obtaining ingress to the temple by force of arms, but others,\r\nsensible that Eleazar was as good a patriot as Manahem, were for\r\nwithdrawing.\r\n\r\nThen Eleazar, seeing the quarrel becoming great among them, fanned the\r\nflame by a speech that ended with the words:\r\n\r\n“Men, zealous for God, you who out of a love of liberty have revolted\r\nfrom the Romans, do you now betray that liberty? You who have cast off\r\nthe yoke of a foreign tyrant, do you now take upon you the yoke of one\r\nhome-born?”\r\n\r\nSimon, who was standing beside Eleazar, clenched the matter.\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand gold pieces to the man who brings me the head of\r\nManahem,” he shouted.\r\n\r\nThereafter all was confusion.\r\n\r\nSome of the Zealots, siding with Eleazar, turned their swords against\r\ntheir former chief, of whose tyranny they had already begun to weary;\r\nthe rest, closing around, endeavored to defend him. Then, beneath the\r\ntemple walls, there began a desperate fight, maintained for a short\r\ntime with equal fortune on both sides; but when the armed Levites,\r\nunder Simon and Eleazar, descended from the temple, the scale of battle\r\nturned. The defeated party fled through Ophel, within whose narrow\r\nand winding streets Manahem contrived to elude capture; but only for\r\na day or so. Discovered in his hiding-place, he was dragged forth and\r\nslaughtered.\r\n\r\nThus ignominiously perished the last of the sons of the famous Judas,\r\nthe Galilean, sons, who, like their untamable father, had spent their\r\nlives among the craggy heights of Judæa, waging guerilla warfare with\r\nthe Roman.\r\n\r\nEleazar now took upon himself the captaincy of all the disorderly\r\nelements in the city. Simon was his second in command, and under their\r\njoint direction the siege against the Roman garrison in the three\r\nHerodian towers was pressed forward with vigor. But the fierce attack\r\nwas met by a defense equally fierce; ten Zealots died for every Roman,\r\nsince the garrison from the cover of their lofty walls could deal far\r\nmore hurt to the besiegers than the besiegers could to them.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of the fact that the advantage was all on his side,\r\nnot many days had passed before Metilius, yielding to a strange and\r\nunaccountable spirit of cowardice, suddenly announced his intention\r\nof seeking terms with the enemy. Crispus, thunderstruck at this\r\nweak-mindedness, argued in vain. Metilius held the command, and it was\r\nhis to do even as he listed.\r\n\r\nGreat was Eleazar’s satisfaction to hear himself addressed from the\r\nbattlements by Metilius on the question of capitulation.\r\n\r\nAn immediate armistice was proclaimed; and Eleazar, after a brief\r\ndeliberation with Simon, declared that if the Romans would descend from\r\nthe towers, and deliver up their arms, they should be permitted to go\r\nforth from the city free and uninjured. To this Metilius assented,\r\nand the compact was ratified by the reception into the towers of\r\nthree Jews, distinguished in rank, who, giving their right hand to\r\nthe tribune, swore “by the altar of God” to carry out the promised\r\nstipulations.\r\n\r\nPlaced in a disgraceful position by this coming surrender, Crispus\r\ndetermined at first that he would remain behind, though he should be\r\nthe only one to do so; sword in hand he would die, defending to the\r\nlast the Tower of Hippicus. But he soon relinquished this notion as\r\na piece of splendid but useless heroism; he would be casting away\r\nhis life without saving the fortress. It would be wiser and more\r\nsatisfactory to live on, and take part in his father’s campaign against\r\nthe city, a campaign that would soon reduce the Jews to submission\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt the hour fixed for the surrender--it was the Sabbath day--the\r\nRomans descended from the towers, and stood on level ground.\r\n\r\nThey were received by Eleazar and Simon, who pointed the way the\r\nsoldiers should march. Metilius, on looking, saw that his band would\r\nhave to pass beneath two spears set obliquely in the ground so as to\r\nform a kind of yoke; the Jews were adopting a Roman ceremony applied\r\nboth to slaves and to captives taken in war.\r\n\r\nAt this sight the blood even of Metilius rebelled.\r\n\r\n“This was not included in the compact,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Nor excluded,” replied Eleazar with an insulting smile. “March!”\r\n\r\nOpposition being, in the circumstances, futile, the Romans were\r\ncompelled to submit to the humiliating ceremony. As each passed beneath\r\nthe yoke he delivered his sword and buckler to certain of the Zealots\r\nstationed there to receive them.\r\n\r\nBut when the last Roman had been deprived of his arms, the Levitical\r\nguards of Eleazar, sword in hand, came crowding round the little band.\r\nTheir significant looks sent a sudden suspicion to the hearts of the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\n“The end has come, Metilius,” said Crispus. “’Twere better to have gone\r\non fighting.”\r\n\r\n“Prepare for death, ye uncircumcized fools,” cried Eleazar with a\r\nsavage laugh.\r\n\r\n“Death?” faltered Metilius. “Death, when ye have vowed by a solemn oath\r\nto respect our lives!”\r\n\r\n“We swore by the altar of God, and such oath is not binding upon the\r\nconscience of a Jew. Here standeth Gamaliel’s son, Simeon, master of\r\nall the learning of the scribes. Let him say whether I speak falsely.”\r\n\r\nAnd that rabbi, who chanced to be present, stepped forward to justify\r\nEleazar’s assertion.\r\n\r\n“The elders have delivered it,” said he, “that if a man swear by the\r\ngold of the altar he must keep his oath, or dread condemnation; but if\r\nhe swear by the altar only, he is not guilty if he break his word.”\r\n\r\nBut Johanan ben Zacchai, who happened likewise to be present, opposed\r\nthis casuistry.\r\n\r\n“Simeon,” said he, “which is the greater, the gold, or the altar that\r\nsanctifieth the gold?” And, turning to Eleazar, he said:\r\n\r\n“Will ye indeed slay these men?”\r\n\r\n“Aye! Did they show us mercy in the day of Florus?”\r\n\r\n“You will never get another Roman garrison to submit.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so.”\r\n\r\n“Defer the deed, for to-day is the Sabbath.”\r\n\r\n“A holy day and a holy deed--to exterminate idolaters.”\r\n\r\nSimon, although a party to Eleazar’s guilty trick, was nevertheless\r\nwilling to make an exception in favor of one of the captives.\r\n\r\n“Give me the life of this man,” said he, pointing to Crispus.\r\n\r\n“That fellow?” said Eleazar, with a wrathful glance at Crispus. “He is\r\nthe one who has done us the most hurt. Why do you seek to spare him?”\r\n\r\n“Because at my trial he was the first to rise and rebuke the wicked\r\nFlorus.”\r\n\r\n“He is the man,” said Simeon ben Gamaliel, “who defied and insulted\r\nus in our own synagogue by snatching a Christian damsel from the\r\npunishment justly due to her.”\r\n\r\n“These heathen,” said Eleazar, “when they get the opportunity, try to\r\nmake us forswear our faith. Verily, we will do the like by them.”\r\n\r\nThe bravery exhibited by Crispus throughout the siege of the Prætorium\r\nhad created in Eleazar a feeling, not of admiration, but of rage; and\r\nthis rage was now enhanced by the serene and fearless bearing of the\r\ncaptive.\r\n\r\nDrawing his sword he walked over to Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Cursed polytheist, what is the name of your chief god?”\r\n\r\n“He is called Jupiter.”\r\n\r\n“Then curse the name of Jupiter, if you would save your soul alive.”\r\n\r\nEleazar’s sneering and insulting menace drove Crispus to a foolish, yet\r\nheroic, defiance.\r\n\r\n“Men,” said he, turning to the Romans behind him, “the end has come.\r\nLet us die bravely.” Then, raising his hand aloft to heaven, he cried,\r\n“Sovereign Jupiter, all hail!”\r\n\r\n“Swine that thou art!” exclaimed Eleazar; and, grinding his teeth with\r\nrage, he plunged his sword to the very hilt into the side of Crispus,\r\nwho sank to the ground as one dead.\r\n\r\nQuickened by Eleazar’s example, the Levites and Zealots began a\r\nmassacre of the defenseless captives. But Crispus’ words had not\r\nbeen without effect upon the Romans. How bravely they died let that\r\nhistorian say who was contemporary with the event.\r\n\r\n“They neither defended themselves, nor asked for mercy, but only\r\nreproached their slayers for breaking their oath and the articles of\r\ncapitulation. And thus were all these men barbarously murdered, all\r\nexcepting”--alas! that it should be written of a Roman!--“all excepting\r\nMetilius; for when he entreated for mercy and promised that he would\r\nturn proselyte and be circumcized, they saved him alive, but none else.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus was Roman rule extinguished in Jerusalem in the year 66 A.D., a\r\nlittle more than a century after its capture by the great Pompey.\r\n\r\nOn that same Sabbath, the high priest Matthias, in view of the\r\ngreat triumph, decreed that the evening sacrifice should partake of\r\na thanksgiving character; and that, to enhance the dignity of the\r\noccasion, the water used in the service should be taken, not from the\r\nordinary draw-well in the southern court of the sanctuary, but from the\r\nhallowed Pool of Siloam outside the city wall.\r\n\r\nBut the Levitical train dispatched on that errand returned with\r\ndismayed faces and empty urns.\r\n\r\nSiloam would take no part in the wicked thanksgiving. _Its waters had\r\nceased flowing!_[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                            A GOOD SAMARITAN\r\n\r\n\r\n“He is opening his eyes! _He lives!_”\r\n\r\nSo spoke Vashti as she knelt beside the silent and recumbent form of\r\nCrispus.\r\n\r\nThe unmistakable rapture in her tone seemed to displease the woman\r\nstanding beside her.\r\n\r\n“Why should you be glad, child? He is an enemy to our race.”\r\n\r\n“Mother!” said the girl, reproachfully. “Did he not save me from\r\nscourging?”\r\n\r\n“Is that any reason why we should imperil our lives on his account?\r\nWe shall be stoned to death if the Zealots learn that we are hiding a\r\nRoman in our house. Better for us that he were dead.”\r\n\r\n“O, mother, hush! lest he should hear your unkind words.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, though awake, heard nothing of this conversation, being too\r\nfaint and confused at first to understand anything. Gradually, with\r\nthe clearing of his senses, he discovered himself to be lying upon\r\nthe floor of a low-roofed chamber that had latticed windows, and was\r\nprettily furnished in Oriental style. He wondered what place it was,\r\nand how he came to be there. Then, as memory began to assert its sway,\r\nhe recalled the scene in which he had last closed his eyes--Eleazar’s\r\nglare of hatred, the swift sword-flash, the sharp pang of pain, and the\r\nsinking into darkness and insensibility.\r\n\r\nHe had expected sudden death at the hands of Eleazar; but clearly he\r\nwas not dead yet. Some person must have removed his supposed corpse\r\nfrom the pile of massacred Romans, and who could that person be but\r\nthe lovely maiden that knelt beside him?\r\n\r\nHe tried to lift himself upon one elbow, but fell back exhausted by the\r\neffort. There was no strength left in him.\r\n\r\n“Are you in pain?” asked Vashti.\r\n\r\n“No; only weak--weak!” he said in a voice that startled him; he could\r\nnot speak above a hollow whisper.\r\n\r\nVashti placed her left arm beneath him; and, lifting him, she put a cup\r\nto his lips.\r\n\r\n“Drink!” said she.\r\n\r\nCrispus drank, of what he knew not--some dark liquid--but it seemed to\r\nendow him with new life.\r\n\r\n“Eat!” was her next command.\r\n\r\nSubmissive as a child, Crispus ate of whatever her hand offered.\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued she, “sleep, and sleep will give you strength.”\r\n\r\nHe wanted to ask questions, but Vashti enjoined silence by placing\r\nher finger upon his lip in so pretty a way that he was fain to do\r\nher bidding; so, closing his eyes, Crispus, almost against his will,\r\ndropped off to sleep again.\r\n\r\nHis sleep extended over several hours.\r\n\r\nOn waking he found Vashti by his side again, ready to minister to his\r\nwants; and, as these wants included a desire for knowledge on certain\r\npoints, she proceeded to enlighten him.\r\n\r\n“You are in my mother’s house,” said she. “This is my own chamber; and\r\nthere,” she continued, pointing with pride to several tiers of shelves\r\nfilled with papyrus rolls, “there are my Greek books.”\r\n\r\nShe then went on to tell him how he came to be there. After the\r\nmassacre of the Roman garrison, Josephus, at her request, went to\r\nthe fierce Eleazar and asked for the body of Crispus, saying, “He is\r\na Roman noble, known to me. I pray you, let me give him honorable\r\nburial.” Eleazar’s reply was, “Take him; I war not with the dead.”\r\nWhen the supposed corpse of Crispus had been conveyed to her house\r\nVashti sorrowed over it, but her grief suddenly turned to joy when she\r\ndetected a movement of his lips.\r\n\r\nBy a happy stroke of fortune--the hand of God, Vashti called\r\nit--Eleazar’s sword had passed through the ribs of Crispus without\r\ninjuring the vital parts. His seeming death was a swoon due to loss\r\nof blood, a loss so great that a few more drops might have ended the\r\nmatter. There was life in him, however--faint it might be--but still\r\nlife, life that with due care might be preserved. And so--for they\r\ndurst not call in a physician, lest the truth should become known to\r\nthe outside world--she and her mother, who had some knowledge of the\r\nhealing art, had dressed his wounds and carried him to this chamber.\r\n\r\nVashti smiled sweetly when Crispus murmured his gratitude. “Now, I pray\r\nthe gods that the Zealots may not discover this, your kindness to me.”\r\n\r\nThen she told him of Metilius’ base appeal for life, a story to which\r\nCrispus listened with scorn.\r\n\r\n“Rightly named Metilius--little coward!” said he. “What became of him?”\r\n\r\n“The Zealots dismissed him with contempt.”\r\n\r\n“What a life his will be! He’ll never dare show his face among Romans\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nHe attempted to raise himself, but, as on the previous day, found that\r\nhe was too weak to do so.\r\n\r\n“How long am I to lie here?” he said with something like a groan.\r\n\r\n“Till your lost blood be made good.”\r\n\r\n“When will that be?”\r\n\r\nAnd though pre-informed by her mother that Crispus’ return to vigor was\r\nlikely to be a matter of weeks, Vashti replied with a cheerful smile,\r\n“Not many days hence,” justifying herself by the knowledge that to put\r\na patient in a desponding mood is to retard his recovery.\r\n\r\nVashti’s mother was named Miriam, an elderly dame, so hard and sour of\r\nvisage, that Crispus could but wonder how she came to have a daughter\r\nso fair and graceful. He formed a somewhat adverse opinion of Miriam.\r\nTrue, she visited his chamber every day; but, as he could plainly see,\r\nher inquiries as to his progress were merely perfunctory; in spite of\r\nthe fact that he was the son of the great Roman Legate of Syria, she\r\nlooked upon him as an encumbrance--nay, more, as a positive danger,\r\nin view of Zealot rule, a person to be got rid of at the earliest\r\nopportunity; and Crispus inwardly chafed at being unable to oblige her\r\nin this respect. A Jewess of the orthodox, narrow-minded type, she was\r\nout of sympathy with Vashti’s ideals; and Crispus mentally blessed the\r\nlate Hyrcanus in that he was of a different character from his wife,\r\nand had given his daughter an Hellenic as well as an Hebraic training.\r\n\r\nThe dissimilitude betwixt mother and daughter had become accentuated of\r\nlate owing to Vashti’s conversion to Christianity. When questioned on\r\nthis last matter, Vashti acknowledged, striving the while to hide her\r\ntears, that the change of faith had caused Miriam to become strangely\r\nhard and cold.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps this growing spirit of estrangement on the part of\r\nMiriam that caused Vashti to find a solace in the companionship of\r\nCrispus, who, though a heathen, seemed more in sympathy with her than\r\nher own Judaic mother.\r\n\r\nCrispus marveled at Vashti’s care for him, marveled still more as the\r\ndays went by without any slackening of her ministrations. An ideal\r\nnurse, she seemed bent on doing everything within her power to render\r\npleasant his enforced inactivity. Tactful to a nicety, she was never\r\nin the way and never out of it. Responsive to the passing whims of\r\nher patient--and what patient is not whimsical at times?--she could\r\nrecognize when he wished for solitude, and would leave him to himself;\r\nif he were desirous of conversation, she was ever ready to meet his\r\ndesire. On learning that he had a great liking for Herodotus, she drew\r\nthat charming, old-world historian from her little library, and read to\r\nhim day by day, seldom failing to illumine the subject with interesting\r\ncomments of her own; and once, at eventide, she took her harp and\r\nsang in a voice so sweet that Crispus begged for a repetition of the\r\npleasure; and, ever after that, as the shades of twilight fell, she\r\nwould sing to him from that cycle of psalms which, though he knew it\r\nnot, are destined to be sung till the end of time.\r\n\r\nIt puzzled Crispus that Vashti should so interest herself in him.\r\nWas this interest the expression merely of her gratitude, for the\r\nservice he had rendered her in the synagogue, or was it the expression\r\nof a more tender sentiment? Was Vashti seeking to win his love? The\r\nthought troubled him. It was hard to be compelled to crush this rising\r\ndesire on her part--that is, supposing it existed--for however pure,\r\nattractive, and beautiful Vashti might be, she was not for him; he\r\nmust remain faithful to the unknown Athenaïs, not only because it\r\nwas a point of honor for a Cestius to keep faith, but also because\r\nhis ambition could not easily forego the kingdom dependent upon his\r\nmysterious marriage.\r\n\r\nVashti, it seemed, had a little brother, a child of eighteen months.\r\nOne morning she brought him with some diffidence into the chamber,\r\nand, finding that Crispus did not object to his presence, but, on the\r\ncontrary, derived considerable amusement from his infantine attempts at\r\ntalking, she brought him every day; and though Vashti was “as learned\r\nas Minerva”--Crispus’ own expression--she proved herself in other\r\nrespects a veritable tom-boy, playing at “hide and seek,” and romping\r\nround the room till the child fairly shrieked with delight. It was a\r\nnew feature in her character, and one that pleased Crispus.\r\n\r\nTired at last of play the little fellow clambered upon his sister’s\r\nknee, and nestled against her breast.\r\n\r\nVashti’s remark that he was called Arad led to a talk upon personal\r\nnames and their meanings; and, of course, Crispus soon fastened his\r\nattention upon her own name.\r\n\r\n“Vashti is a Persian word said to mean beautiful,” she replied with a\r\nlittle blush.\r\n\r\n“You could not change it for one more appropriate,” remarked Crispus,\r\n“unless it were----”\r\n\r\nHe paused. A wild suspicion had suddenly taken possession of him, a\r\nsuspicion that set his pulses thrilling with a delicious pleasure.\r\n\r\n“What new name would you suggest?” asked Vashti with a wondering smile.\r\n\r\n“What do you say to Athenaïs?” he asked, watching her keenly as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nWas he mistaken, or did Vashti give a start as if she recognized\r\nthe hidden purport of the question? Her surprise, if such it were,\r\nwas quickly under control. She looked at him with eyes calm and\r\nunfathomable in their expression.\r\n\r\n“No true Hebrew maiden would like _that_ name.”\r\n\r\n“Wherein doth it offend?”\r\n\r\n“It is derived from the name of a Grecian goddess.”\r\n\r\n“And therefore suitable for one as learned as Athene.”\r\n\r\nVashti smilingly shook her golden tresses at the compliment.\r\n\r\n“I do not like the name,” she said, as she gently rocked Arad to sleep.\r\n\r\nSo far Crispus’ experiment was a failure. There was nothing in her\r\nmanner to suggest the hypothesis that she had been the veiled lady of\r\nBeth-tamar. Still, there seemed to be a sort of shadowy connection\r\nbetween her and the unknown Athenaïs. He reasoned thus:--Vashti was\r\nvery like the statue of one, Pythodoris; that statue was the gift of\r\nPolemo; Polemo was he who had arranged the wedding of Athenaïs.\r\n\r\nCrispus resolved to proceed warily.\r\n\r\n“You appear to be well versed in Grecian history,” said he. “Can you\r\ntell me who Pythodoris was?”\r\n\r\nVashti became lost in thought for a few moments, and then replied:\r\n\r\n“There was a queen of Pontus who bore that name. She died about thirty\r\nyears ago.”\r\n\r\n“Any relation to the present king, Polemo?”\r\n\r\n“His mother.”\r\n\r\n“Was she a beautiful woman?”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I don’t know,” laughed Vashti. “Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“There was a statue of her in the Prætorium.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you’ve seen it you ought to know whether she were beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“The statue was very like _you_.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! then she wasn’t _very_ beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“The statue was so like you that at first sight I thought it was meant\r\nfor nobody else till the name Pythodoris, carved on the pedestal,\r\ncorrected my error.”\r\n\r\nVashti’s eyes opened wide in wonder. She could assign no reason why the\r\nstatue of Pythodoris should resemble herself.\r\n\r\n“And she was the mother of the present king, you say? Have you ever\r\nseen this Polemo?”\r\n\r\nVashti replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n“But he was present at the banquet of Florus.”\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose I must have seen him without knowing him,” replied\r\nVashti; and, having succeeded in hushing her little brother to sleep,\r\nshe carried him gently from the room.\r\n\r\nSomething like a sigh escaped from Crispus as he realized that since\r\nVashti did not know King Polemo she could not have been the veiled lady\r\nof Beth-tamar.\r\n\r\nNext day when Crispus suggested that it might hasten his recovery if\r\nhe could breathe the purer air of the roof, Vashti and her mother,\r\nlifting the cords at the head and foot of his pallet, carried it,\r\nalbeit with some difficulty, up the short staircase and deposited\r\nit upon the flat roof beneath the shade of a trellis overhung with\r\nvine-leaves, so placing the pallet as to prevent him from being\r\noverlooked by the occupants of the neighboring houses; while at the\r\nsame time an opening in the parapet near by enabled him, whenever he\r\nchose to raise himself upon his elbow, to observe a good deal of what\r\nwas going on in the streets below.\r\n\r\nAll Jerusalem was resounding with the preparations for war. Though the\r\naged and the wise might shake their heads gravely and hold aloof from\r\nthe revolutionary movement, the young and the unthinking, elated at\r\nseeing the last vestige of Roman rule swept from the capital, flung in\r\ntheir lot with the Zealots and spent a considerable portion of each day\r\nin the performance of military exercises under captains appointed by\r\nEleazar and Simon. The city walls were being repaired and strengthened,\r\nthe very women and children laboring enthusiastically in the task. The\r\nair rang with the beating of steel upon the anvil, the steel that was\r\nto be dyed deep in Roman blood! At night Ophel was one red glow with\r\nthe light that came from the various forges.\r\n\r\n“They have hewn down the golden eagle from the gate of the temple,”\r\nsaid Vashti.\r\n\r\n“They cannot take him from the sky, however,” replied Crispus, pointing\r\nto a magnificent specimen that was sailing aloft with slow and majestic\r\nmotion. Suddenly, this eagle drooped its pinions, and, descending like\r\na plummet, alighted upon the parapet just above the head of Crispus.\r\n\r\nVashti started back with a little scream; then, by motioning with her\r\nhands, she tried to make the eagle fly off; he took no notice of her,\r\nhowever, but sat with unruffled plumage, the embodiment of majesty\r\nand gravity. Try as she would Vashti could not get the eagle to stir,\r\nbut, finding that he remained quiet and showed no disposition to attack\r\neither Crispus or herself, she relinquished her efforts and resumed her\r\nconversation, timorously glancing from time to time at the eagle, which\r\nkept its post as though it were some faithful sentinel appointed to\r\nwatch over the patient.\r\n\r\nThis little incident was not without significance for Crispus, whose\r\nmind, in common with other minds of that day, saw an omen in anything\r\nout of the common. At the very moment when Eleazar was threatening him\r\nwith death, he had appealed to sovereign Jupiter. Now, the eagle being\r\nthe symbol of that deity as well as of the Roman empire, he could not\r\nhelp interpreting its presence as a heaven-sent assurance that Jove and\r\nthe legions would effect his safety. Aware, however, that Vashti had no\r\nfaith in his gods, he kept this opinion to himself.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the eagle flew off. The two watched till it became a\r\nmere black speck upon the glowing gold of the western sky--watched till\r\nit faded from view.\r\n\r\n“It will return on the morrow,” said Crispus confidently.\r\n\r\nSure enough, next morning the eagle came winging its way eastward; and,\r\nas before, it alighted upon the parapet above the head of Crispus, as\r\nif bent on renewing its watch. Vashti, grown somewhat accustomed to its\r\npresence, viewed it now with less apprehension, and made no attempt to\r\nrepel it.\r\n\r\n“The money of the new government,” said she, with a sad smile,\r\nexhibiting a shekel, one of those pieces known to the Jews of after\r\nages as “The money of danger,” and now, by reason of their rarity,\r\neagerly sought by numismatists.\r\n\r\n“If their fighting prove no better than their coinage, it will go ill\r\nwith them,” remarked Crispus, who, on closely inspecting the supposed\r\nshekel, saw that it was in reality a Roman coin that had recently\r\nreceived in the Jewish mint a fresh stamp--namely, that of a palm\r\nbranch encircled with Hebraic characters, whose signification was,\r\n“_The first year of the freedom of Zion_.”\r\n\r\nSo imperfectly, however, had the work been executed that the original\r\neffigy, the head of Nero, with its Latin inscription, was discernible\r\nbeneath the Jewish impression.\r\n\r\n“They try to efface Cæsar, but fail,” said Crispus. “Good! I accept the\r\nomen.”\r\n\r\nAt eventide the eagle flew off, returning again next morning. On the\r\nfourth day, however, it did not appear, nor on any subsequent day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                    “THOU WILT NEVER TAKE THE CITY”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moon of a lovely autumnal night silvered the sleeping Roman camp\r\nthat lay at the entrance of “the going up to Beth-horon.” Not a sound\r\ndisturbed the silence, save the light tread of the vigilant sentinels\r\npacing their rounds.\r\n\r\nThe array of black tents, glittering arms, and lofty standards,\r\noccupied a vast area, square in shape, and defended on all sides by\r\nan earthen rampart, and an outer trench filled with water from a\r\nneighboring stream--defenses made by a three-hours’ labor with mattock\r\nand spade, the whole army having toiled at the task. No matter how\r\nshort their stay in a place--and the camping on the present occasion\r\nwas for one night only--the Roman legionaries would never, at least in\r\na hostile country, take their sleep till they had secured themselves\r\nfrom attack in the manner just described. Four gates, facing the four\r\npoints of the compass, gave entrance to the camp, whose countless\r\nlines of tents crossing each other at right angles looked with the\r\nintervening spaces like the streets and squares of a well-planned city.\r\n\r\nThis military force was under the command of Cestius Gallus, imperial\r\nLegate of Syria, and its object was the restoration to Roman rule of\r\nthe rebellious city of Jerusalem, sixteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe tent of the general-in-chief, or, to employ the Latin term, the\r\nprætorium, was pitched, according to immemorial custom, by the gate\r\nnearest to the enemy, in this case the southern one, as being on the\r\nside towards Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThis tent, furnished in the simplest fashion and lighted by a lamp\r\npendent from the roof, contained but one occupant, the Legate.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about sixty years, grave and soldierly; his face at\r\nordinary times had a look that showed him to be, in spite of his\r\nmilitary profession, a man of a humane and kindly disposition; but now,\r\nand for many days past, there had been in his aspect something so stern\r\nand cold that the soldier about to ask a favor of his general shrank\r\naway, reserving the matter for another time.\r\n\r\nThe sudden entering of a man unannounced caused the Legate to look up\r\nwith a frown.\r\n\r\n“Who comes here?” said he, shading his eyes with his hand.\r\n\r\n“A wise man and a fool.”\r\n\r\n“How can that be, royal Polemo?” said Cestius, smoothing his brows as\r\nhe recognized his visitor.\r\n\r\n“He who is not a fool at times is never a wise man,” returned the\r\nPontic king, taking his seat with an air that proved him to be on\r\nfamiliar terms with the Legate.\r\n\r\n“You have returned from Achaia very quickly,” said Cestius.\r\n\r\n“Twelve days on the sea going and coming. I doubt whether the double\r\nvoyage were ever performed in so short a time. I found the god”--this\r\nwith a sneer--“at Olympia.”\r\n\r\n“You told him of the revolt?”\r\n\r\n“All that I knew of it.”\r\n\r\n“And his commands?”\r\n\r\nPolemo drew forth a scroll of papyrus, secured with red wax and\r\nimpressed with a seal which Cestius knew to be that of Nero. Breaking\r\nthe seal, the Legate read the missive, first silently, and then, for\r\nthe benefit of Polemo, aloud.\r\n\r\n  “Our faithful servant, Cestius Gallus, is herewith granted full\r\n  liberty to deal with the rebellious city of Jerusalem in whatever\r\n  way he deemeth best for the interests of the Roman republic.\r\n\r\n  “Given on this, the eighth of the Ides of September, in the twelfth\r\n  year of our reign. NERO AUGUSTUS.”\r\n\r\n“Liberty to deal with the city as I please?” exclaimed Cestius, a\r\nfierce fire sparkling from his eyes and a color lighting up his\r\nhitherto sallow cheek. “_Delenda est Hierosolyma!_ Not a man in it\r\nshall live. Its women and children shall be sold into slavery. I will\r\ngive their temple to the flames and the city to destruction. Not one\r\nstone of it shall be left standing upon another. Jerusalem shall be\r\nblotted from the face of the earth.”\r\n\r\nThis threatened doom being the very end for which Polemo had been\r\nclandestinely working during a space of many years was received by\r\nhim with secret rapture; nevertheless he could not help wondering why\r\nCestius, usually humane in his dealings, should have become animated\r\nby a spirit so merciless. But now, as Polemo noticed, what he had not\r\nnoticed before, namely, that the Legate was wearing a black pallium,\r\nthe emblem of mourning, he was seized with a sudden suspicion.\r\n\r\n“I am the last of my race,” said Cestius, answering the question\r\nexpressed by the other’s eyes. “There is no son to carry on my name.”\r\n\r\n“Say not that Crispus is dead!” gasped Polemo, whose look of grief\r\ncould not have been keener if he, and not Cestius, had been the father.\r\n“Crispus dead! Then my plan for the humiliation of--Oh, it cannot be!\r\nHow? When?”\r\n\r\n“You shall learn. ’Tis the time for it,” said the Legate with a glance\r\nat a clepsydra that stood on the table before him.\r\n\r\n“The time?” repeated Polemo wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Every night at this hour I strengthen my spirit in its purpose of\r\nvengeance by hearing anew from the mouth of an eye-witness the story of\r\na massacre wrought by the lying oath of a cowardly priest.”\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke the curtain draping the entrance of the tent was\r\nlifted, and there entered two spearmen leading between them a captive\r\nwhose dress and physiognomy bore unmistakable evidence of his Jewish\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n“A deserter from the city. Now, fellow, tell thy tale.”\r\n\r\nFrequent repetition had made the captive fluent in his narration, so\r\nwith an unfaltering voice and in a simple style he gave a full account\r\nof the calamitous ending to the brave defense of the Prætorium.\r\n\r\n“Art certain that Eleazar’s was a fatal stab?” asked Polemo.\r\n\r\n“It could not have been otherwise; he dealt stroke upon stroke,”\r\nreplied the Jew, who saw no reason why he should not heighten the story\r\nof Eleazar’s cruelty. Lives there a man who can relate an event exactly\r\nas it happened?\r\n\r\n“Woe to Eleazar!” said Cestius. “’Twere better for him had he never\r\nbeen born.”\r\n\r\n“What became of the bodies of those that were massacred?” asked Polemo.\r\n\r\n“They were taken outside the city to a place called Aceldama, where it\r\nis the custom to bury strangers. A trench was dug, and the corpses were\r\nflung into it, one upon another.”\r\n\r\n“You saw the body of Crispus treated thus?”\r\n\r\nAnd the man stating, not what had happened, but what he fancied had\r\nhappened, answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n“Flung into a common grave! Lost to me forever!” murmured Cestius. “I\r\nam denied even the melancholy consolation of taking home his ashes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the morning light the Roman army, having breakfasted, prepared to\r\nresume its march.\r\n\r\nAt the first shrill sound of the trumpet the tents fell flat to the\r\nground; at the second, which followed at a measured interval, they\r\nwere piled with other baggage upon wagons and beasts of burden; at\r\nthe third signal the march began, the vanguard filing off in stately\r\norder, eight abreast. Soon the whole of the vast army was in motion,\r\nwinding like a glittering, scaly serpent up the mountain pass that\r\nled towards Jerusalem. Mounted scouts pushed on ahead for the purpose\r\nof forestalling those ambuscades which are the delight of an Oriental\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nCestius, who rode in the center of the host with King Polemo by his\r\nside, became annoyed at the irregular movements on the part of the\r\ncolumns composing the vanguard, who for a time would maintain a march\r\nso brisk as to leave a long interval between themselves and the central\r\ndivision, and then, without any apparent cause, would come to a dead\r\nhalt, moving on again a few minutes afterwards. At last a stop was\r\nmade of such duration that it brought the whole of the army following\r\nto a standstill, thus tending to create a degree of confusion not\r\noften witnessed in the Roman ranks. Unable any longer to control his\r\nimpatience, Cestius, setting spurs to his steed, galloped forward,\r\nbent on administering a sharp reproof to the tribune in charge of the\r\nvanguard.\r\n\r\nOn being questioned as to the cause of this long halt that officer\r\nreferred his angry general to the tall and stately figure of a priest,\r\nstanding a few paces in front of the first rank and bearing in his\r\nhand the short _lituus_ or augurial staff. It was Theomantes, priest\r\nof Jupiter Cæsarius, the one-time councilor of Florus, but now acting,\r\nand that at Cestius’ own wish, as the official augur of the Roman army.\r\nThe Legate had a high regard for him, but when Theomantes, presuming on\r\nthis regard, ventured to check the advance of the whole army, he was\r\nundoubtedly usurping the authority of the general, an act not to be\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\n“How now, Theomantes?” cried Cestius angrily. “Why this delay?”\r\n\r\n“Seest thou yon eagle?” said Theomantes, pointing to an eagle in front\r\nof them, poised apparently motionless in the air.\r\n\r\n“I see it. And what then?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis the divine director of our march. When it advances, we advance;\r\nwhen it stops, we stop; for so will it be to our advantage.”\r\n\r\n“And when it retreats, I suppose we must retreat,” sneered Cestius.\r\n“Shall a father, bent on the sacred duty of avenging his son, be stayed\r\nby a fowl of the air? Fellow, thy bow and arrow,” he cried, addressing\r\na Cretan archer that stood by; and, having received what he had asked\r\nfor, Cestius fitted a shaft to the string, and, taking aim at the\r\neagle, let fly.\r\n\r\nThe shot was a good one; pierced by the arrow, the eagle dropped to the\r\nearth like a falling stone.\r\n\r\n“Fools!” exclaimed the Legate scornfully, as he noticed the dismayed\r\nlooks of the superstitious soldiers, “exercise your reason. If yon\r\neagle had the power of foreseeing the future, would it not have kept\r\nfar hence, and not have flown hither to meet its death by the arrow of\r\nCestius?”\r\n\r\n“Cestius Gallus,” said the augur, solemnly, “thou hast slain the\r\nmessenger sent by Jove to direct our march. The wrath of the gods will\r\nbe upon thee for this. _Thou wilt never take the city._”\r\n\r\nWith this he broke his augurial staff in two, and cast the pieces at\r\nCestius’ feet; then, walking to the roadside, he seated himself upon\r\na crag; and, covering both head and face with his mantle, in token\r\nof grief, he added: “Here will I abide till I see thee returning in\r\nheadlong confusion.”\r\n\r\n“I will prove thee a liar,” said the Legate fiercely. “Forward!” he\r\ncontinued, addressing the vanguard.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, gazing from the lofty ramparts of their city, beheld with\r\nsecret fear the drilled legions of Rome ascending and descending “the\r\nhills that stand about Jerusalem,” and stationing themselves at every\r\nstrategic point; their eyes, turn them which way they would, saw\r\nnothing but the glitter of the eagles; all retreat was cut off; the\r\ncity was girt with a ring of steel.\r\n\r\nAs the house of Miriam, widow of Hyrcanus, was one of the highest on\r\nMount Zion, and as Mount Zion was the highest of the four hills on\r\nwhich Jerusalem was built, it follows that the military display outside\r\nthe city could not escape the notice of Crispus as he lay upon the\r\nroof. The sight filled him with patriotic pride, a pride enhanced by\r\nthe knowledge that it was his father who led that mighty host; _he_\r\nwould not fail in the work; Rome would again vindicate her supremacy;\r\nand Eleazar and the false, cowardly crew that had taken part in the\r\nbarbarous massacre of the garrisons would receive their merited doom. A\r\npity he, Crispus, must lie here, unable to join in the coming fight!\r\n\r\nBeside his pallet sat the gentle Vashti, her eyes on the Roman host.\r\n\r\n“Your father will not take the city,” said she quietly; “at least, not\r\nat this time.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, almost startled by her air of certainty, asked what reason she\r\nhad for her belief.\r\n\r\n“There are in this city,” replied Vashti, “a multitude of Christians\r\nover whom our Divine Master watcheth, for He is not dead but liveth\r\neternally. Think you that He will permit His saints to fall by the\r\nsword of the Romans? I trow not; those guilty Jews who have hardened\r\ntheir heart against Him will receive their just doom; but of His\r\ndisciples He saith, ‘There shall not a hair of your head perish.’ And\r\ntherefore that we might know when the time is come for us to quit the\r\ncity, He, while on earth, gave us this sign.” Vashti drew from her\r\nbosom a scroll of papyrus written in Greek characters, and read from it\r\nthe following sentence: “‘_When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with\r\narmies, then let them that are in the midst of it depart out._’”\r\n\r\n“How can they depart out with a hostile army camping all round?” asked\r\nCrispus, captiously.\r\n\r\n“How, indeed? Therefore it is necessary that this hostile army should\r\nbe withdrawn for a time.”\r\n\r\n“In order to give the Christians the opportunity to escape!” said\r\nCrispus with a touch of sarcasm in his voice.\r\n\r\nYes, that was her belief, and she had no other reason for it than a\r\nsupposed prophetical passage in a book she called the Evangel! This was\r\nnot the first time (for she had often talked to him about her religion)\r\nthat Vashti had sought to connect her Divine Teacher with the course\r\nof contemporary events. In her view He was the central figure of the\r\nworld’s history; old times pointed to His coming; new times were to\r\nflow from it. Present events were taking place for no other reason than\r\nto advance the interests of the new religion. The general Cestius was\r\nmerely a passive instrument in the hands of the deified Galilæan; his\r\nmarch to Jerusalem was not to vindicate the majesty of Rome, but to\r\nserve as a Divine sign to the Christians, and, having played the part\r\nallotted to him, he was to march back again without taking the city!\r\nCrispus could scarcely listen with patience to a theory so fantastical.\r\n\r\nA Cestius to retreat? Go to!\r\n\r\nHowever, as Vashti quietly remarked in answer to his arguments, the\r\nevent would decide.\r\n\r\n“Is your father a cruel man?” continued she.\r\n\r\n“Quite the contrary; for a soldier he is said to be too merciful.”\r\n\r\n“Yet he has vowed to slay every man in the city, and to sell the women\r\nand children into slavery.”\r\n\r\n“How know you that?”\r\n\r\n“It is shouted at us by the enemy whenever they draw near the wall, and\r\nnot by the common soldiers only: the centurions mock us with the same\r\ndoom.”\r\n\r\n“He thinks me dead, and hence his wrath. ’Tis a pity he should be in\r\nerror. How it would gladden him to know that I am alive! Is there no\r\nway of communicating with him?”\r\n\r\nVashti reflected.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said she, “I can contrive to let him know that you are\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\n“How?” asked Crispus, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“If you will write a letter I will try to have it conveyed to him. I\r\nknow a Christian youth, Heber by name, whom I have but to command, and\r\nhe will perform this service for me. His house is upon the city wall.\r\nTo get to the Roman camp he has but to lower himself by a rope. He can\r\ncarry your message, but whether he can bring one back----”\r\n\r\n“No. ’Twill be a dangerous business to be seen returning. Let him\r\nremain in the Roman camp. And tell him that whatever reward he likes to\r\nask for--in reason--my delighted father will give. And now for stylus\r\nand papyrus.”\r\n\r\nVashti flew to procure writing materials, and Crispus, sitting up,\r\nproceeded to indite the following epistle:\r\n\r\n“To the most excellent of fathers, greeting.\r\n\r\n“Cast off your black pallium, and make a sacrifice to Jupiter the\r\nSaviour, for I, your son Crispus, am not, as you suppose, in Hades,\r\nbut am lodged with the widow Miriam, whose house is in the street of\r\nMillo, abiding secretly for fear of the Zealots. That I have not sought\r\nto escape to the Roman camp is due to my enfeebled frame, which would\r\nnot be living at all, but for the care and attention of a sweet maiden\r\nnamed Vashti.”\r\n\r\n“You must delete the word _dulcis_,” said Vashti.\r\n\r\nBut this Crispus declined to do.\r\n\r\n“Therefore should you take the city”--he put this hypothetically in\r\ndeference to Vashti’s belief--“you must, as owing your son’s life to\r\nher, deal leniently with the nation to which she belongs, and show the\r\nmercy that pertaineth to an honorable Roman general. May we soon meet.\r\n_Vale!_”\r\n\r\nHe added the date, together with a strange sign that puzzled Vashti.\r\n\r\n“A private mark,” he explained. “’Twill convince him of the\r\nauthenticity of this little epistle.”\r\n\r\nLater in the day Vashti went off with the letter; and, returning\r\nafter an interval of two hours, was able to announce that Heber had\r\nundertaken the charge, but from due regard to safety he would not make\r\nthe attempt till after nightfall.\r\n\r\nEvidently he kept his word, for when Vashti visited his house next day\r\nhis mystified kinsfolk declared that he had vanished during the night,\r\ndeserting apparently to the Roman camp, since they had discovered a\r\nrope hanging from the window of his room.\r\n\r\nCrispus from his place on the roof continued to watch with a lively\r\ninterest the doings of the Romans.\r\n\r\nThree days were spent by the Legate in perfecting his arrangements for\r\nthe taking of the city; on the fourth day he advanced, delivering his\r\nattack from the north.\r\n\r\nFor five days the fighting went on, very much to the advantage of\r\nthe Romans; at the close of the sixth day they had captured certain\r\nstrategic points--a capture that made it manifest, even to those\r\ncitizens least experienced in military affairs, that the morrow would\r\nbring with it the fall of the city.\r\n\r\nCrispus, who had watched the operations with the trained eye of a\r\nsoldier, remarked with filial pride: “My father will do in one week\r\nwhat took the great Pompey twelve weeks.”\r\n\r\nBut Vashti shook her pretty head mournfully.\r\n\r\nThat same night the remnant of the Sanhedrim and the captains of the\r\nZealots met in the hall Gazith to deliberate upon their desperate\r\nsituation. There was scarcely a man among them but believed the doom of\r\nthe city to be a matter of a few hours only.\r\n\r\nThe once fierce Eleazar trembled now, remembering that it was _his_\r\nhand that had struck down the Legate’s son. Though Cestius should be\r\nnever so merciful to the rebels, there was one person at least whom he\r\nwas certain not to spare.\r\n\r\nGloom and despondency marked every face but that of Simon; he alone\r\nmaintained a bold front.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow about this time,” said he, “Cestius will be in full retreat.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if the Messiah should descend from heaven to help us,” said\r\nMatthias, the high priest.\r\n\r\n“Earthly means will suffice.”\r\n\r\n“What is your plan, for you evidently have one?”\r\n\r\n“Simply this; I shall go to Cestius and shall say to him, ‘Cestius,\r\nwithdraw your legions,’ and he will withdraw them.”\r\n\r\n“Have we need of madmen?” said Matthias, turning scornfully to Eleazar,\r\n“that you admit this fellow to our councils?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                          THE TRIUMPH OF SIMON\r\n\r\n\r\nNight melted into the golden light of a lovely morning.\r\n\r\nThe Jewish multitude, pale-eyed and anxious, trooped to the city walls.\r\n\r\nTo their surprise the encircling lines of legionaries that had been\r\nposted to the east, and to the west, and to the south, of the city were\r\nall in motion, taking their way to the camp at Scopus.\r\n\r\nConjecturing what this new movement should mean, the Jews came to\r\nthe conclusion that Cestius was massing all his troops for the final\r\nassault, to be delivered from the north.\r\n\r\nThis was likewise the opinion of Crispus; his father was purposely\r\nleaving three sides of the city unguarded in the belief that the Jews\r\nwould fight with less desperation, as knowing that a way of retreat was\r\nopen to them both on flank and rear.\r\n\r\nBy noontide all the various sections of the Roman army were seen to be\r\nconcentrated upon the northern heights of Scopus. Not a cohort, not\r\na maniple, not a single legionary, was visible elsewhere. Even those\r\nstrategic points which on the previous day had been won at the cost of\r\nso much toil and blood were all relinquished, the troops that held them\r\nhaving withdrawn to join the common host.\r\n\r\nThis last movement was, in the eyes of the Jewish multitude, a very\r\nmysterious one. What did it mean? They looked on in silent and\r\nbreathless wonder.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the shrill note of a trumpet rang out upon the morning\r\nair. The distant notes were borne by the breeze in faint cadence to\r\nthe ears of Crispus. With a sudden thrill at his heart he listened,\r\ndoubtful as to whether he could have heard aright. Again the trumpet\r\nsang out. The same strain as before. There was no mistaking its\r\nmeaning, and Crispus sank back with a groan of despair.\r\n\r\n_It was the signal for retreat!_\r\n\r\nThe great army that had set out from Antioch burning to redeem Roman\r\nhonor by recovering Jerusalem was now actually moving off again, at\r\nthe very moment when it might have successfully accomplished its work;\r\nmoving off--to quote the contemporary historian--“without any reason in\r\nthe world!”[18]\r\n\r\nSilently the people stared, scarcely able to believe their eyes. Then,\r\nas each successive evolution made the truth more and more plain, there\r\nburst from a hundred thousand voices a yell that seemed to rend the\r\nvery firmament.\r\n\r\n“THE ROMANS ARE RETREATING!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a stratagem to lure the Jews from the city,” said the bewildered\r\nCrispus, trying to delude himself with false hopes. “They will follow,\r\nand he will fall upon them.”\r\n\r\nHe was right in saying that the Jews would follow.\r\n\r\nThe gates of the city clanged wide, and an armed multitude, Simon at\r\ntheir head, poured forth with intent to harass the retreating foe.\r\n\r\nCrispus, watching with mournful and rueful visage, took his last look\r\nat the soldiers of the Roman rearguard as they stood in glittering\r\nsplendor upon the sky-line. They had faced about on the very summit of\r\nScopus to discharge a flight of arrows at the foremost column of the\r\npursuing Jews; a few moments afterwards and they had disappeared behind\r\nthe heights.\r\n\r\nTheir parting shots had no effect upon the advance of the Jews, who in\r\na wild, tumultuous mass swept forward up the broad, white, dusty road\r\nand over the brow of the hill; in course of time they, too, like the\r\nRomans, became lost to view.\r\n\r\nCrispus fully expected to see them ere long come surging back in\r\nheadlong flight; but no! Sounds as of tumult and fighting reached his\r\nears, but these sounds becoming more and more distant showed that it\r\nwas _not_ the Jews who were fleeing.\r\n\r\nSorrowfully he lay down, and while vainly trying--for he would not\r\naccept Vashti’s explanation of the matter--to devise some theory to\r\naccount for a retreat so strange, he fell asleep. Vashti seized the\r\nopportunity to steal quietly off, and making her way to the temple\r\nturned into the Eastern Cloister or Solomon’s Colonnade. Here the\r\nChristians of Jerusalem were wont to meet, drawn thither by the\r\nknowledge that this place had been a favorite resort of their Lord\r\nwhile upon earth. As Vashti made her way along this arcade she came\r\nupon a little group--men, women, and children--whom she recognized\r\nas adherents of the faith, the holy band that had survived the\r\npersecutions alike of Jewish Sanhedrim and Roman procurator. Their\r\nair, sad yet sweet, and the character of their attire--for they were\r\nhabited as if for a long journey--told her that they were taking their\r\nlast farewell of the temple. Some were gazing wistfully around, as well\r\nknowing that they would see the place no more; a few knelt reverently\r\nupon the pavement, and kissed the stones that had once been trodden by\r\nthe hallowed feet of the Saviour.\r\n\r\nAmong them, exercising a mild and paternal authority, there moved one,\r\ndignified and saintly in aspect, Simeon, son of Cleophas, revered as\r\nbeing the cousin, according to the flesh, of the crucified Master. A\r\npillar of the church, and a witness of the truth, he had already lived\r\nseventy years, and was destined, either from the pure and temperate\r\ncharacter of his life or from being specially favored by heaven,\r\nto live yet fifty more, terminating his long life by a glorious\r\nmartyrdom.[19]\r\n\r\nIt was his hand that had baptized Vashti, whom he now greeted with a\r\ngentle smile.\r\n\r\n“You are quitting the city?” said she, sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“Even so,” returned Simeon; “at intervals, and in small groups, that\r\nwe may not attract the attention of our enemies. We have seen the sign\r\nforetold by the Lord while He was yet with us: ‘Jerusalem compassed\r\nwith armies.’ Therefore do we obey His voice and hasten our departure,\r\nlest the Zealots should return to intercept our flight. The door is\r\nopen; who can tell how soon it may be shut? We have a further sign in\r\nthe Messianic fountain of Siloam that has withdrawn its waters from\r\nthis wicked city.”\r\n\r\n“And whither are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Beyond Jordan to the city of Pella among the mountains. My daughter,\r\nare you not going with us, seeing that upon this city, that hath shed\r\nthe blood of the saints, there is coming utter destruction?--yea,\r\n‘_Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this\r\ntime; no, nor ever shall be._’”\r\n\r\nThere was in the bishop’s words that which set Vashti’s heart thrilling\r\nwith a nameless fear. She yearned to accompany the little band to\r\nPella, but durst not run contrary to the will of her mother, who, she\r\nwell knew, would never be persuaded to quit the city. And there was\r\nlittle Arad. And the good but heathen Crispus, for whose conversion she\r\ndaily prayed, occupied also a place in her heart. No! she could not\r\nbear to part from these, and so she resisted the persuasive words of\r\nher new-found friends.\r\n\r\n“Why will you make me weep?” said she. “If it be the will of the Lord\r\ncan He not protect me here equally as well as at Pella?”\r\n\r\n“Daughter, thou hast well said,” returned Simeon. “Is it not written:\r\n‘Who ever perished, being innocent? or when were the righteous cut\r\noff?’ We leave thee in His hands. Be sure that we shall not fail to\r\npray for thee daily.”\r\n\r\n“Your blessing, father,” said Vashti as she knelt upon the pavement.\r\n\r\n“You have it, my daughter,” replied the good bishop, laying his hands\r\nupon her head.\r\n\r\nThe little band now turned sorrowfully away, casting many a lingering\r\nlook behind. Vashti, gazing from the pillared arcade, watched them as\r\nthey quitted the Shushan or Beautiful Gate, and made their way down the\r\nhillside to the brook Cedron. Crossing the dark stream by a bridge they\r\nascended the leafy slope of Olivet; arrived upon its summit they paused\r\nto take one long, last look at the city, and then, disappearing one by\r\none over the brow of the mount, they became lost to view.\r\n\r\nWith a sense of desolation at her heart, such as she had never before\r\nknown, Vashti went home again to find Crispus awake and chafing because\r\nthe Jews had not yet returned in headlong flight.\r\n\r\nBut the Jews did not return that day; no, nor yet the next! A whole\r\nweek passed, a week filled with strange rumors of Roman defeat and\r\nJewish success.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day the Jewish multitude reappeared, chanting songs of\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nTheir entry into the city took the shape of a triumphal procession,\r\nmade resplendent with chariots and horses, with arms and standards, all\r\ncaptured from the enemy!\r\n\r\nWhen Simon, the hero of the fight, appeared riding in an ivory\r\ncar, whose front and sides were decorated with the gory heads of\r\nslain Romans, the delighted citizens greeted him with the waving of\r\npalm-branches, as though he were the very Messiah. Young maidens flung\r\nflowers before his chariot, and men cast down purple mantles.\r\n\r\n“Hosanna to the son of Giora!”\r\n\r\n“Hail to the Scourge of the Romans!”\r\n\r\nIt was a great day for the Zealot chief, too great in the eyes of the\r\njealous Eleazar, who was beginning to fear that Simon had ambitions\r\ninconsistent with his own supremacy.\r\n\r\n“We must clip the wings of this eagle ere he fly too high,” he muttered\r\ndarkly.\r\n\r\nAs for Crispus, the procession seemed to him like some hideous dream.\r\nCould it be that a fine Roman army, commanded by his own father, had\r\nsuffered defeat at the hands of an undisciplined horde of Oriental\r\nbarbarians?\r\n\r\nIt was even so; Vashti that evening told him the whole story as she had\r\ngathered it from others.\r\n\r\nSimon’s followers, keeping to the heights that overhung the Pass of\r\nBeth-horon, had followed the Romans day by day, attacking them in\r\nfront, flank and rear, but never venturing an open engagement. The\r\nRoman legionaries, demoralized by the retreat, seemed to lack even the\r\nspirit to defend themselves. At last, when more than five thousand of\r\nhis men had fallen in this guerilla warfare, Cestius, to avoid further\r\ndisaster, was compelled to resort to a stratagem of despair. Having\r\nwith studied pomp and display formed and fortified a camp, he stole\r\noff quietly in the dead of night, leaving the tents standing and the\r\nwatch-fires burning, so as to deceive the enemy for a time. The trick\r\nanswered; and Cestius, gaining a few hours’ start, succeeded by forced\r\nmarches in bringing his panic-stricken troops to Antipatris, behind\r\nwhose ramparts he was secure from attack. As for the camp with its\r\nstandards, furniture, and military stores, this was, of course, seized\r\nand plundered by the delighted Jews.\r\n\r\nNot since the day when the German barbarians, under Arminius, had cut\r\nto pieces the legions of Varus in the depths of the Teutoburg forest,\r\nhad a disaster so great befallen the Roman arms.\r\n\r\nHad this defeat happened under any other commander, the shame of it\r\nwould have touched to the quick the patriotic pride of Crispus, but\r\nthat this defeat should have been brought about by the bad generalship\r\nof his own father----!\r\n\r\nFilial affection seemed for the moment to die within Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Doth my father still live?” he muttered moodily. “Had he no sword to\r\nfall upon? He hath made the name of Cestius synonymous with coward.”\r\n\r\nThat day, the first time for several weeks, Crispus was able to rise\r\nfrom his bed and assume his Roman garb.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the momentous question as to how he should get safely out\r\nof Jerusalem, a question that was settled in a very remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nMiriam’s house, like all the larger houses in Jerusalem, was built\r\naround a square court paved with tiles, and adorned in the middle with\r\na fountain.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, Vashti was sitting alone in this court, and thinking,\r\nas she was always thinking, of Crispus, when a heavy footstep caused\r\nher to look up. The thing that she had been fearing during many weeks\r\nhad come to pass at last. There, a few paces distant, stood Simon\r\nof Gerasa! Only by a great effort was she able to keep herself from\r\nfainting at sight of the dark and terrible Zealot.\r\n\r\n“Interpret me this riddle,” said he. “Into the house was seen to go\r\nthat which never came forth again.”\r\n\r\nShe knew that he was alluding to Crispus, and her heart almost ceased\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\n“To be more plain, doth not Crispus the Roman abide here?”\r\n\r\nIn defiance of the teaching of Simeon the bishop, that a falsehood is\r\nnever justifiable even when its purpose is to save human life, Vashti\r\nwas tempted to deny all knowledge of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Why should you think that?” she replied in a trembling voice.\r\n\r\n“You do not deny it? Take me to him.”\r\n\r\nVashti did not stir.\r\n\r\n“Come, girl,” exclaimed Simon, growing impatient, “delay not, or I\r\nsummon my Zealots to search the house, and if these patriots once\r\nenter,” he continued with a grim smile, “they’ll leave little of value\r\nbehind. I seek the Roman to do him not evil but good. I swear it.”\r\n\r\n“_You_ swear!” flashed out Vashti, her indignation getting the better\r\nof her fear. “You, who broke your oath and massacred the Roman\r\ngarrison! What is _your_ word worth?”\r\n\r\nThe Zealot laughed unashamedly.\r\n\r\n“When a man, desirous of hanging a dog, lures the creature to him by\r\na tempting bait, do you call him wicked? And what are the Romans but\r\ndogs, unfit to live.”\r\n\r\n“Then Crispus, being a Roman, is a dog?”\r\n\r\n“He is; but he is the best of the dogs, and therefore am I minded to do\r\nhim a service.”\r\n\r\nCompelled to yield, Vashti led the way, wondering what Crispus would\r\nthink of her action in bringing the Zealot upon him.\r\n\r\nShe found him in an upper chamber, sitting at a table, reading a Greek\r\nscroll of one of the gospels, and frowning at what he considered its\r\nbizarre style. Upon the same table lay a drawn sword.\r\n\r\n“‘_And they shall lay thee even with the ground_,’” read Crispus. “Now,\r\nI trust that this man may prove a true prophet, for--ah! who comes\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\nHis eye, lifting, had caught sight of Simon. Familiarized with sudden\r\nperils, Crispus kept an unmoved countenance.\r\n\r\n“How fares the noble patient?” said Simon, sardonically.\r\n\r\n“Why, as to that, you may test his strength, if you will,” replied\r\nCrispus, laying his hand upon the sword.\r\n\r\nBut though he spoke thus boldly, and longed to slay the man who had\r\nhelped to massacre his fellow-Romans, he felt himself, in his present\r\nstate of convalescence, to be as weak as a babe. It was all over with\r\nhim if the Zealot took him at his word.\r\n\r\n“Tush!” responded Simon, with folded arms. “Do you not see that I am\r\nunarmed. I come as a friend. Were I thy enemy and desired thy death\r\nshould I have sought to save thee from the hand of Eleazar?”\r\n\r\n“And why that attempted grace on your part?” asked Crispus, laying down\r\nhis weapon.\r\n\r\n“Were you not the first to rise at my trial and condemn the dastardly\r\nFlorus?”\r\n\r\n“My condemnation of Florus was not meant as the justification of Simon.”\r\n\r\n“Be that as it may. Let me state my errand. You are surrounded by\r\nenemies, who, if they did but know that you are abiding here, would\r\nbreak in and slay you. Be it mine to save you. I am here secretly to\r\noffer you a safe conduct to your Roman friends at Antipatris.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis scarcely credible,” said Crispus.\r\n\r\nHe was amazed, as well he might be, at the offer. Why should Simon be\r\nwilling to undertake this enterprise, which, if detected, would put him\r\nat feud with Eleazar and the whole body of the Zealots?\r\n\r\n“My reason for this course I reserve till to-night,” was the only\r\nanswer Simon would give to Crispus’ questioning.\r\n\r\n“But if you are willing that I should get safely from Jerusalem, why\r\nnot let me arrange my departure in my own way?”\r\n\r\n“Do so, and die. You cannot escape in the daytime, and at night no one\r\ncan leave the city without a signed order from Eleazar. But should you\r\nsucceed in evading the sentinels at the gates you will find the public\r\nroads leading from Jerusalem patrolled by armed Zealots, who slay all\r\nwhom they detect escaping from the city. ‘Jerusalem,’ they say, and\r\nrightly, ‘hath need of all her sons, and he who deserts her at this\r\ncrisis shall receive a traitor’s doom.”\r\n\r\nHow Vashti rejoiced that the Christians had seized the first\r\nopportunity to escape!\r\n\r\n“Your safety,” continued Simon, addressing Crispus, “lies in my\r\nescorting you; apart from me you will be stopped, interrogated, slain.”\r\n\r\n“I will avail myself of your offer,” said Crispus. “But I forewarn you\r\nthat when the Roman army comes again from Cæsarea, as come it will, I\r\nshall be found within its ranks, and if we meet in battle look to no\r\nsparing from me.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said Simon coldly. “To-night at the sixth hour be ready for\r\nthe journey. I will bring two steeds with me. But a word of caution.\r\nExchange that Roman costume for the Hebrew caftan and abba, if you\r\nwould be safe.”\r\n\r\nWith that Simon took his departure, directing his steps to the temple,\r\nwhere he found to his surprise that the Sanhedrim were holding a\r\nmeeting in the hall Gazith, a meeting to which they had not thought fit\r\nto invite him.\r\n\r\nThe object of their deliberations, so it seemed, was to appoint\r\nmilitary governors for the various toparchies or districts, of not only\r\nJudæa, but also of Galilee, Idumæa, and Peræa, these three provinces\r\nhaving decided to throw in their lot with the Jewish cause.\r\n\r\nAs the Sanhedrim, having dispatched this business, were departing,\r\nSimon encountered Eleazar on the threshold of the hall.\r\n\r\n“A council, and I not invited?” he said in an injured tone. “But there,\r\nlet be! How have matters sped?”\r\n\r\n“Joseph ben Gorion and Ananus have been appointed rulers of Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\n“Priests both,” commented Simon.\r\n\r\n“_I_ am a priest,” returned the other.\r\n\r\n“Were these two like thee I would rejoice,” replied the Zealot, who\r\nrecognized the military abilities of Eleazar.\r\n\r\n“Rejoice, then, that I am made ruler of Idumæa.”\r\n\r\n“Why, so I do. What more?”\r\n\r\n“Josephus hath rule over the two Galilees.”\r\n\r\n“Another priest, and a smooth-tongued, double-faced Pharisee; not to be\r\ntrusted.”\r\n\r\nEleazar proceeded to enumerate other appointments, few of which met\r\nwith Simon’s approval.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” said the Zealot, when the other had finished his list,\r\n“that the Sanhedrim hath no need for my services.”\r\n\r\n“Your name was not brought forward in connection with any office.”\r\n\r\n“Not even by you?” Eleazar was silent. “Who was the first to enter\r\nAntonia? Not a Sanhedrist, I trow. Who promised to free Jerusalem from\r\nits siege, and did so? Not a Sanhedrist. Who was foremost in the attack\r\non the retreating legions of Cestius? Not a Sanhedrist. And now do they\r\npass me by, and distribute the rewards of victory among themselves?\r\nVerily, you have not done well, Eleazar, son of Ananias.”\r\n\r\nAnd Simon stalked wrathfully away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs night drew on Crispus’ feelings became a curious mingling of\r\npleasure and regret--pleasure at the thought of freedom, regret at\r\nhaving to part from Vashti, whose companionship had grown dear to him.\r\n\r\nIn this hour of parting as they sat in the upper chamber by the light\r\nof a silver lamp, Vashti gently sought, as she had frequently sought\r\nbefore, to bring him over to her faith.\r\n\r\nCrispus shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Your creed is an impossible one,” said he. “A religion that tells us\r\nto love our enemies would be the ruin of states. Where would the Roman\r\nempire have been had we followed that doctrine? The world will never\r\nbe ruled by love, but by _this_.” Taking his sword by the point he held\r\nit aloft.\r\n\r\n“Look!” said Vashti, gently.\r\n\r\nCrispus looked where she pointed, and lo! upon the chamber wall was a\r\nshadow cast by the light of the lamp, and that shadow had _the shape of\r\na cross_!\r\n\r\nHe who had not started at Simon’s sudden advent started now. He lowered\r\nthe sword and sheathed it with a thoughtful air. Upon him who was\r\nso much disposed to catch at omens that little incident made more\r\nimpression than all Vashti’s discourses.\r\n\r\n“The time of your departure is at hand,” she said sorrowfully. “You\r\nmust kiss little Arad before you go, and say farewell to my mother.”\r\n\r\nWhen the sixth hour of the night had come, Crispus, disguised in Jewish\r\ngarb, descended to the door of Miriam’s dwelling. Vashti was with him,\r\nand looked cautiously forth. Under the radiance of the full moon the\r\nstreet of Millo was half in silver light and half in ebon shadow. Out\r\nof the latter emerged the tall form of Simon leading two horses by the\r\nbridle.\r\n\r\nAs Crispus beheld Vashti’s eyes eloquent with the sorrow of parting, he\r\nlonged to take her within his arms and press her lips to his. He knew\r\nthat this maiden loved him, as well as he knew that he loved her. But\r\nbetween them there lay the shadow of the unknown Athenaïs; and even\r\nshould Crispus, invoking the law, repudiate his consort, he would be no\r\nbetter off as regards Vashti, whose Christian faith, dearer to her than\r\nearthly love, forbade her to marry one that had put away his wife.\r\n\r\nWith the words “Farewell, sweet Vashti; may we soon meet again!” he\r\nmounted the horse, and, in company with Simon, rode slowly away,\r\npausing for a moment at the street corner to wave with his hand a final\r\nadieu.\r\n\r\nThey drew nigh to the gate Gennath, where a guard was stationed.\r\nSimon’s well-known face procured a ready passport both for himself and\r\nhis companion.\r\n\r\n“Who is he that rides with thee?” asked the captain of Simon.\r\n\r\n“In his way as good a patriot as myself,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe two passed through the gate and galloped off in the moonlight, the\r\nsense of freedom and the rapid motion through the night air causing\r\nCrispus to tingle with exhilaration.\r\n\r\nIt was well that Simon remained with him. Twice they were stopped by\r\nbands of Zealots, who speedily withdrew on recognizing the “Scourge of\r\nthe Romans.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, though in a way grateful for Simon’s protection, did not feel\r\nmuch disposed to talk with him; the Zealot, on his part, was moody and\r\ntaciturn, and so the strangely-assorted pair rode side by side with\r\nscarce a word till in the first faint light of an Eastern dawn the\r\ndistant towers of Antipatris rose to view.\r\n\r\nAt about a hundred yards from the gate Simon drew rein.\r\n\r\n“We part here.”\r\n\r\n“Good! And now why this friendly act on your part?”\r\n\r\n“My bringing you here is a proof that Simon the Black can sometimes\r\nkeep faith. I pledged my word to your father, Cestius, to conduct you\r\nsafely to Antipatris. He will tell you the story,” added the Zealot,\r\nturning as if about to ride off.\r\n\r\n“I prefer to hear it now, and from you,” said Crispus, a suspicion of\r\nthe truth beginning to dawn upon his mind.\r\n\r\n“Well, since thou art curious, listen. On the night following Cestius’\r\ninvestment of the city, a youth was seen descending the wall by a rope.\r\nI dispatched a party, who brought him back. Upon him I found a letter,\r\nwhose contents I kept to myself. On the sixth night of the siege our\r\naffairs being, as you may remember, a little desperate, I went to the\r\nRoman camp, and was admitted to the presence of Cestius. ‘Your son\r\nis alive,’ I said, ‘as this letter plainly shows; but he shall die,\r\nunless you immediately withdraw your troops.’ He threatened to hang\r\nme for daring to come with such a message. ‘As you will,’ I answered,\r\n‘but know this, I have left behind me the order that if I am not back\r\nin the city within three hours Crispus is to be brought forth upon the\r\nbattlements and crucified.’\r\n\r\n“That stayed his hand. He fell to thinking, and the end of it was that\r\nlove for his son triumphed over his duty to the state. But I made it\r\nmy condition not to surrender you till he had entirely withdrawn to\r\nCæsarea.”\r\n\r\n“And you broke your promise. My father pledged his word to retreat, and\r\nyou attacked him during that retreat.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I broke no promise, for I warned Cestius that if he retired\r\nI should be unable to check the Zealots from following. ‘Let them\r\nfollow,’ were his words. He welcomed the idea of pursuit, thinking to\r\ngive us over to the sword, but he found he had to deal with men that\r\ncould fight.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, from the safe covert of the hill-tops. Your courage stopped with\r\nthe open plain.”\r\n\r\n“I may not talk longer with you, for I see soldiers issuing from\r\nthe city-gate, and I have no desire that my head shall decorate the\r\nbattlements of Antipatris. I have fulfilled my word to Cestius, and now\r\nI return. We shall meet again under the walls of Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Simon turned his steed and galloped off by the way he had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nLooking towards Antipatris, Crispus saw a small body of foot soldiers\r\nadvancing from the gate; at their head was a mounted officer, none\r\nother than Terentius Rufus, who came spurring forward with all speed,\r\nas if bent on learning the business of the two Jewish-looking horsemen.\r\n\r\n“Hold, fellow!” he cried, reining in his steed, as he drew abreast\r\nof Crispus. “Who art----?” And then, his voice suddenly changing, he\r\nexclaimed, “By the gods, ’tis Crispus.”\r\n\r\nHis quick look of delight was instantly succeeded by one of gravity.\r\n\r\n“Turn from the city,” said he, “and ride back a little way, lest you\r\nshould be recognized by my men. Five thousand aurei are a strong\r\ntemptation to mercenary natures.”\r\n\r\n“How mean you?”\r\n\r\n“There is a price on your head.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! what have I been doing to deserve it.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis said that when Cestius had invested Jerusalem you wrote a craven\r\nletter imploring him to raise the siege, or your life would be forfeit.”\r\n\r\n“I would that I had my hand on the throat of the man that invented that\r\nlie.”\r\n\r\n“Think not that _I_ ever believed it. Unfortunately, however, this\r\nslander hath reached the ears of Nero, who, in his rage, hath decreed\r\nthat the lives of the two Cestii, father and son, are forfeit to the\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\nConfounded by this tidings, Crispus could do nothing for a few moments\r\nbut stare blankly at his friend.\r\n\r\n“What has become of my father?” said he, finding his voice.\r\n\r\nRufus’ hesitation told its own tale.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” said Crispus, growing pale. “How did he die?”\r\n\r\n“Like a Roman; he fell on his sword.”\r\n\r\nCrispus paid to his father’s memory the tribute of a brief and pitying\r\nsilence. It was a bitter thought to him that if he had not written\r\nthat letter Cestius might now be living, the conqueror of Jerusalem,\r\nto be greeted at Rome like a second Pompey with the title, “Noster\r\nHierosolymarius.”\r\n\r\n“Go not to Antipatris, or to any town where you are known,” said Rufus,\r\n“since any man may lawfully slay you. The streets of Cæsarea are posted\r\nwith tablets offering five thousand aurei for the head of Crispus.”\r\n\r\n“I need scarcely ask what has become of my father’s estates?”\r\n\r\n“Confiscated,” replied Rufus, laconically.\r\n\r\nThat he had toppled down in a moment from his high office of Secretary\r\nto the Legate of Syria; that he had lost his patrimonial estates--nay,\r\neven the fact that he had been doomed to death--was to Crispus as\r\nnothing in comparison with the thought that he was now deprived of all\r\nopportunity of returning to Jerusalem in company with legions to avenge\r\nthe massacre of the Roman garrisons.\r\n\r\nGone, too, was his hope of a kingdom. The doom pronounced upon him\r\nwas a proof that Nero had revoked his purpose of ratifying Polemo’s\r\nintended disposal of his crown. And his wife, the mysterious Athenaïs?\r\nWas it likely that she would remain faithful to him on learning that\r\nthe Roman noble whom she had wedded was now a pauper, and that a\r\nproscribed one?\r\n\r\n“Who commands in this war, now that my father has gone?”\r\n\r\n“Old Flavius Vespasian, with his son Titus as second in command.\r\nTitus,” continued Rufus, with a wry mouth, “our equal once. Now he’ll\r\nhold his head high above us both. Perhaps my lady Berenice will smile\r\non him now, seeing what a great man he has become.”\r\n\r\n“Berenice? ah!” said Crispus in a curious tone. “Of course she hath\r\nheard of my disgrace. How doth she take it?”\r\n\r\n“One of the proscriptive tablets directed against you hangs upon her\r\npalace-wall at Cæsarea, whence it may be inferred that your fall is not\r\na matter of much concern to her.”\r\n\r\nCrispus wondered whether Vashti would suffer a placard dooming him to\r\ndeath to remain upon the wall of _her_ house.\r\n\r\n“You must live in concealment,” advised Rufus, “till Nero be persuaded\r\nto revoke his unjust decree; or, it may be, that your freedom will\r\ncome in another way, for if all the rumors circulated be true, our\r\npresent Cæsar is like ere long to lose his throne, if not his life,\r\nso outrageously doth he shock public sentiment; in which case all his\r\nacts will be annulled by his successor, and thus your patrimonial\r\nestates may return to you. The question is, where will you hide in the\r\nmeantime?”\r\n\r\n“I will go,” replied Crispus, his mind still under the singular\r\nimpression evoked by the shadow of the cross, “I will go to a people\r\nthat will suffer death rather than betray a suppliant; I will go to the\r\nChristians of Pella.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                        THE AMBITION OF BERENICE\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than two years and a half had now passed since the disastrous\r\nretreat of Cestius, and during all that time no Roman legion had come\r\nwithin sight of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nVespasian, the successor of Cestius, had first directed his arms\r\nagainst Galilee, almost every city of which was in a state of rebellion.\r\n\r\nThanks to the spirit and activity displayed by the warrior-historian\r\nJosephus, as well as to the situation of the Galilean cities, most of\r\nwhich were built upon hill-tops and almost inaccessible crags, the\r\ncampaign was prolonged for more than a year.\r\n\r\nThen came a long interval of inactivity, due to a series of revolutions\r\ntaking place at Rome, the seat of the government. Within the space of a\r\nsingle year the throne of the Cæsars was occupied in turn by a series\r\nof ambitious generals, the self-murdered Nero having been succeeded by\r\nGalba, by Otho, and by Vitellius.\r\n\r\nDuring these political crises Vespasian was under the necessity of\r\nhaving his position as commandant in Judæa successively recognized and\r\nconfirmed by each new Cæsar, and as this was a matter requiring much\r\ntime, it led to frequent pauses in the campaign, a state of affairs\r\nvery much to the advantage of the revolutionary factions in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe Roman army destined to act against the holy city had formed a huge\r\ncamp upon the seashore at a point a few miles to the north of Cæsarea,\r\nand here day by day with unfailing regularity the iron warriors of\r\nRome went through those evolutions and exercises that had made them the\r\nmasters of the world.\r\n\r\nThis similitude of war naturally attracted crowds from the neighboring\r\nregion. It became quite a custom with the fashionable Greeks of Cæsarea\r\nto take their morning promenade along the seashore for the purpose of\r\nwitnessing a spectacle as thrilling almost as the contests at Olympia\r\nor the combats of the amphitheater.\r\n\r\nOne fair, sunny morning in the month of June, just as the legions were\r\nbeginning their daily drill, under the personal inspection of Vespasian\r\nand his son Titus, there drove up a magnificent chariot, which, by the\r\ngrace of the lictors, was given a place considerably nearer to the\r\nexercising troops than was allowed to the ordinary spectator, for the\r\noccupant of the chariot was none other than the fair princess Berenice,\r\nwho was paying her first visit to the Roman camp.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Titus detected her presence upon the field than he at\r\nonce made his way to her side. His look and voice alike told how much\r\nhe was enamored of the fascinating princess, who at the age of forty\r\nhad, like Cleopatra, all the grace and beauty of youth.\r\n\r\n“Princess, you seem sad to-day,” said he, after an interval of silence.\r\n“Of what are you thinking?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she replied, with a tantalizing little sigh, “perhaps of\r\nCrispus.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you torment me with the name of a rival who is dead?”\r\n\r\n“_Is_ he dead?” said Berenice. “True, nothing has been heard of him\r\nsince he parted from Terentius Rufus at Antipatris.”\r\n\r\n“And that is more than two years ago. The ban put upon him by Nero has\r\nbeen revoked. If he be alive why does he not show himself, since he has\r\nnothing now to fear?”\r\n\r\n“Except the being claimed by a wife whom he does not like,” said\r\nBerenice with a silvery laugh, and a glance at the house called\r\nBeth-tamar, which, seated on a lofty crag, was plainly visible from the\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\n“Princess,” said Titus, with a tender look, “if Crispus should ever\r\nreturn it will mean to me----”\r\n\r\nBerenice raised her finger with a witching smile.\r\n\r\n“Ah me! Now you are going to make love again. We shall never be\r\nfriends, if you do that. Let me watch your Romans. They interest me.”\r\n\r\nThe air at that moment was all alive with the crisp, sharp commands of\r\ntribune, and centurion, and decurion.\r\n\r\nThe exercises performed by the Romans comprehended feats in running,\r\nleaping, wrestling, swimming, sword-play, hurling the pilum--everything\r\nin short that could add strength to the body or tend to success in war.\r\n\r\nHere, Cretan archers, having set up their targets, were demonstrating\r\nthe deadly accuracy of their aim. There, Balearic slingers were\r\ndischarging their leaden bullets, which not infrequently melted with\r\nthe heat engendered by the swift rush of the missile through the air;\r\nhere, a body of soldiers was busily engaged in bridging within a given\r\ntime a broad sheet of water; there, a group were vigorously occupied in\r\nstorming a wooden fortress, whose defense was as vigorously maintained\r\nby a garrison of fellow-Romans.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is like war itself,” said Berenice, fascinated by the\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\n“So like, that it is the fashion of the soldiers to call the exercise a\r\nbloodless battle, and the battle a bloody exercise.”\r\n\r\n“Where are these men going?” she asked as a certain cohort tramped past\r\nat full speed.\r\n\r\n“They are marching to Dora and back.”\r\n\r\n“That is not very hard work.”\r\n\r\n“You think so, princess. But mark that each soldier is carrying the\r\nfull equipment customary in war time, consisting of various utensils,\r\nas well as victuals for fifteen days, the whole amounting to sixty\r\npounds’ weight, not including arms, for the Roman soldier considers\r\nthese, not as a burden, but as a part of himself. Weighted thus, he is\r\nto march in this burning sunlight to Dora and back, the double journey\r\nbeing a distance of twenty miles, and he is to do it within five hours.\r\nIf this be not hard work, what is?”\r\n\r\n“And supposing they should take more than five hours?”\r\n\r\n“Terentius Rufus, who rides at their head, will see to that.”\r\n\r\n“But if they should fail?”\r\n\r\n“He will punish them.”\r\n\r\n“And what will the punishment be?”\r\n\r\n“It takes various shapes. Yon cohort, as is shown by the carrying of\r\nthe eagle, is the First Cohort of the legion. They may be degraded by\r\nbeing compelled to resign the eagle, and to take the second place; or\r\ntheir diet for the week may be barley bread instead of wheaten; or they\r\nmay be excluded from their tents, and made to sleep at a distance from\r\nthe camp.”\r\n\r\n“How often do the troops practice these exercises?”\r\n\r\n“Every day of the year.”\r\n\r\n“But when a soldier has learned his work?”\r\n\r\n“He goes on practicing just the same. Let a man have been forty years\r\nin the army, that fact will not exempt him from the daily exercise. And\r\nmark this: every weapon you see in use now, every helmet, breastplate,\r\nand shield, is double the weight of those used in actual warfare.”\r\n\r\nBerenice opened her eyes in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Why, a battle must be an easier matter than the daily exercise!”\r\n\r\nTitus laughed.\r\n\r\n“The soldier would much prefer a battle,” said he.\r\n\r\nBerenice spoke no more for a long time; so long that Titus began to see\r\nfrom her rapt expression that some momentous thought was occupying her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“I am thinking,” said she, in reply to his questioning, “I am thinking\r\nwhat _I_ would do with these troops, were they mine.”\r\n\r\n“And what _would_ you do with them, princess?” asked Titus with a smile.\r\n\r\nInstead of replying directly to this, Berenice put a question.\r\n\r\n“Is not your father Vespasian a skillful general?”\r\n\r\n“He hath no equal in the art of war; it is not I only who say this, but\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“And he is liked by all the legions, near and far?”\r\n\r\n“Liked is but a feeble word to express his hold over them.”\r\n\r\n“But he is somewhat lacking in ambition?”\r\n\r\n“Ambition is apt to die with the sixtieth year.”\r\n\r\n“But his son Titus is ambitious, and being so, and having great\r\ninfluence over his father, should act as a spur to his mind.”\r\n\r\n“Princess,” said the puzzled Titus, “to what does all this tend?”\r\n\r\n“I am thinking,” said Berenice, watching him keenly from beneath the\r\ndark fringe of her half-closed eyelids, “I am thinking what a pity it\r\nis that the great Vespasian should be serving Cæsar, when he might be\r\nCæsar himself. The present emperor Vitellius can show no hereditary\r\ntitle to the imperial throne; an ambitious general, he gained the\r\npurple by fighting for it. Why should Vespasian not do the like?”\r\n\r\nIt was a startling suggestion, so startling as almost to deprive Titus\r\nof breath. He glanced at the charioteer, who stood by the horses’\r\nheads--glanced in fear lest the man should have overhead Berenice’s\r\ntreasonable remarks, despite the low tone in which they were spoken.\r\n\r\n“When Titus can call himself Cæsar’s son,” she whispered, “then will\r\nBerenice listen to his love--not till then. Go,” she added, with a\r\nlittle peremptory wave of her hand. “Ponder it well!”\r\n\r\nLeft to herself, the princess, sinking back upon the silken cushions of\r\nher chariot, indulged in a pleasing reverie.\r\n\r\n“The idea is new, and it frightens him,” she murmured with a somewhat\r\ncontemptuous smile. “But he will grow used to it. I have sown the seed\r\nin his mind, and it will grow and bear fruit.”\r\n\r\nDaringly original in all her ways, Berenice had often embarked upon\r\nsome political enterprise which, pronounced by her more sober-minded\r\nbrother Agrippa to be impracticable, had nevertheless met with\r\nbrilliant success. Would she succeed in this, a more daring venture\r\nthan any she had hitherto dreamed of? Why not? All things are possible\r\nto the brave, and why should not the brave Vespasian, the idol of the\r\nlegions, prevail against the feeble-minded Vitellius, whose follies\r\nwere daily alienating the loyalty of the nations?\r\n\r\nThe chief obstacle in the way was honest old Vespasian himself; he\r\nmight refuse to listen to the voice of the charmers, Berenice and\r\nTitus, charm they never so wisely. But, if otherwise, and if the\r\nenterprise succeeded, what glory would be hers!\r\n\r\nEven now it filled her with pride to think that she was, in a manner,\r\nthe mistress of all the troops she saw exercising before her. Recover\r\nJerusalem they might, and would; but destroy it--never! Thanks to her\r\ninfluence over Titus, the holy city would be spared from dilapidation,\r\nthe temple preserved from the torch. She was the new Esther destined to\r\nsave the Hebrew nation from destruction--destined, too, if Titus would\r\nbut exercise his ambition, to be the empress of the world, the mother,\r\nit might be, of a line of Cæsars, all adherents of the Jewish faith!\r\n\r\nAnd if Cæsar were once the disciple of Moses, the conversion of the\r\nworld would follow.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these brilliant dreams her ear caught the sound of a\r\nquiet footfall; and, turning her head, she saw--Crispus!\r\n\r\nShe gave a start, as was natural in one who supposed him dead, or at\r\nthe least to be hundreds of miles away. Crispus, keenly attentive,\r\nfancied he could detect on her face an expression akin to dismay; at\r\nany rate it was an expression very different from her tender, lovable\r\nlook in the Prætorium when she had avowed her wish to stay and die with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“I have startled you, princess.”\r\n\r\n“You are as one returning from the dead,” she said with a faint smile.\r\n\r\n“And the dead are not always welcome visitors.”\r\n\r\nThen for a brief space there was a silence, during which both seemed to\r\nbe reflecting.\r\n\r\n“What do you here?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Would it surprise you, princess, were I to say that I am seeking my\r\nwife?”\r\n\r\n“Your wife?” repeated Berenice, in her eyes an odd look as of fear, at\r\nleast that is how Crispus interpreted it. “Your wife?”\r\n\r\n“You did not perhaps know that I had a wife?”\r\n\r\n“If you keep the matter a secret from the world how is one to know it?\r\nWhat is her name?”\r\n\r\n“You do not know it?”\r\n\r\n“How should I?” replied Berenice with a touch of impatience in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you her name, seeing that it is unknown to me.” This\r\nanswer seemed to afford some satisfaction to Berenice. “Nay, I have\r\nnever yet seen my wife’s face.”\r\n\r\n“You are telling me strange things,” laughed Berenice. “I pray you, my\r\nlord Crispus, mystify me no farther, but speak plainly.”\r\n\r\n“Why, so I will.”\r\n\r\nLeaning with folded arms upon the broad brim of the chariot, and\r\nlooking directly into the eyes of Berenice, who seemed helplessly\r\nfascinated by his gaze, Crispus proceeded to relate the story of his\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n“As,” concluded he, with a glance at the distant Beth-tamar, “as it was\r\nin this neighborhood that I first met Athenaïs, I naturally turn to\r\nthis neighborhood in the hope of again meeting her here.”\r\n\r\n“And you do not really know who this Athenaïs is?”\r\n\r\n“I do not. As you doubtless know, King Polemo died suddenly, a year\r\nago; and, unfortunately for me, died without revealing the secret. But\r\nthe three years’ limit is now past, and it is therefore permissible for\r\nAthenaïs to reveal herself by sending me the ring.”\r\n\r\n“And if she chooses _not_ to reveal herself, you may never know whom\r\nyou wedded.”\r\n\r\n“That is so.”\r\n\r\n“I greatly fear,” said Berenice with a grave shake of her head, “that\r\nyour unknown bride will prefer to keep herself hidden from you.”\r\n\r\n“Why should she so act? She was not coerced into the match. She\r\naccepted me of her own free will.”\r\n\r\n“True, but reflect that you are not the great Crispus of her\r\nanticipation. She wedded you in the hope of sharing the crown of\r\nPontus, and that hope is now extinguished, Pontus having become annexed\r\nto the empire.”\r\n\r\n“Your opinion then is that a woman should take for her husband one\r\nwell endowed with material advantages, and that should he, through\r\nmisfortune, lose these advantages, the woman is justified in discarding\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“Though woman may not profess that doctrine with her lips,” smiled\r\nBerenice, “she’ll carry it out in practice. But answer me this: should\r\nyou, by happy chance, discover your wife, would you keep her against\r\nher will? Would you not grant her a divorce, if such were her desire?”\r\n\r\nCrispus gravely shook his head.\r\n\r\n“She cannot part from me, nor I from her, for be it known to you, O\r\nprincess, that I am a Christian, and a Christian can be separated from\r\nhis wife by death only.”\r\n\r\nTidings so unexpected caused Berenice to draw a sharp breath. Her look\r\nof horror could not have been greater if Crispus had suddenly announced\r\nhimself as a deadly leper.\r\n\r\n“_You, a Christian!_” she gasped.\r\n\r\n“The name is displeasing to you, I know; so it was once to me. If you\r\nwill hear me----”\r\n\r\nShe cut him short with an imperative gesture.\r\n\r\n“I have had the chief exponent of Christianity, Paul of Tarsus,\r\nlecturing in chains before me; where _he_ failed, _you_ can hardly hope\r\nto succeed. Go!” she exclaimed, disdainfully waving him away with her\r\nhand as though he were a slave or some other inferior creature. “Yet\r\nstay! one question I will ask,” she continued with a certain uneasiness\r\nof manner that did not escape Crispus’ notice. “In what light do you,\r\nas a Christian, regard the holy temple?”\r\n\r\n“As an obstacle to the progress of Christianity,” he replied\r\nsignificantly, as he turned on his heel and walked quietly away. “Veni,\r\nvidi, _non_ vici,” he murmured sorrowfully.\r\n\r\nBerenice watched him with a strange fear at her heart.\r\n\r\n“A Christian,” she murmured; “and one who hates the temple! Now, if he\r\nshould accompany the legions to Jerusalem how easy for him, when they\r\nare camping against the holy house, to fulfill his dream by throwing a\r\nlighted torch through its windows. If _that_ be his aim, I will foil\r\nit. He shall not be permitted to take part in the siege. Titus shall\r\nprevent him from joining the army. I have but to say the word and\r\nVespasian will banish him from Palestine.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Crispus, suspecting something of Berenice’s intentions\r\ntowards him, and resolving to forestall her, walked along the shore\r\nintent upon finding Vespasian, with whom he had always been a great\r\nfavorite.\r\n\r\nHe found that general joining in the exercises like a common soldier,\r\none of the ways by which he maintained his popularity with the troops.\r\n\r\nA burly, bluff, red-faced man he looked less like a warrior than some\r\nhonest old farmer who had just for sport’s sake put on the scarlet\r\npaludamentum of a general.\r\n\r\nHe greeted Crispus right heartily, and wanted to know where he had been\r\nhiding himself so long, a question which by the way Berenice had not\r\nthought of asking. So Crispus related how upon his proscription he had\r\ntaken refuge with the Christians first at Pella and then at Antioch,\r\nand how, whenever he was in danger of being detected by the minions of\r\nNero, the brethren would convey him by devious routes to some other\r\nChristian community; and how, in the end, convinced by infallible\r\nargument that theirs was the true and only religion, he himself had\r\njoined the sect.\r\n\r\n“A good soldier marred!” growled Vespasian, on hearing this last.\r\n“My cousin Flavius Clemens is a Christian. An excellent character\r\nonce, but now look at him! Takes no interest in state affairs or\r\nmilitary matters. This world is nothing to him. A woman and no man!\r\nmild-mannered, lacking in spirit and backbone.”\r\n\r\n“There is no reason, sire, why a Christian should not be a good\r\nsoldier. As a matter of fact, I have come hither to ask for a place in\r\nthe army that is to be sent against Jerusalem; I care not how humble\r\nthe post so long as it puts me in the forefront of the battle.”\r\n\r\n“Now, that’s the way to talk,” cried Vespasian delightedly. “A place in\r\nthe army? You shall have it. There’s a post waiting for you. The First\r\nCohort of the Twelfth Legion hath lost its tribune.”\r\n\r\n“Dead?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Dead! No! Degraded! ’Twas but a few days ago he received his baton.\r\nYesterday he came to me, reeking with perfumes. Ye gods! is it a\r\nsoldier’s business to be perfuming himself. ‘I would rather you had\r\nsmelled of garlic,’ I cried. ‘Return to the ranks.’--You shall captain\r\nthat cohort. You have heard of the Twelfth Legion before, eh? ’Twas one\r\nof those that fled at Beth-horon. They are longing to redeem their lost\r\ncharacter. You shall show them how. You accept the post? Good! Come\r\nwith me and let me show the First Cohort its new tribune.”\r\n\r\nAs they made their way along the shore two figures came walking\r\nslowly towards them. One was a legionary, wearing an armlet to which\r\nwas attached a chain, two cubits in length, its other end being\r\nfastened to a similar armlet clasped round the wrist of a somewhat\r\ndistinguished-looking personage.\r\n\r\nIt was a Jewish captive and his Roman guard.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner saluted Vespasian; and, as if well acquainted with\r\nCrispus, gave him a friendly smile.\r\n\r\nCrispus gazed, and then suddenly recognizing the captive he there and\r\nthen tendered him a warm thanksgiving; for the captive was none other\r\nthan Josephus, the man who had been instrumental in saving his life by\r\nbegging his supposed corpse from Eleazar.\r\n\r\nWhen Josephus had resumed his walking, Vespasian remarked:\r\n\r\n“Of all the rebels who fought against us in Galilee that man was the\r\nmost valiant. When he was taken prisoner I had much ado at first to\r\nkeep our soldiers from killing him.”\r\n\r\n“I deemed him to be more of a scholar than a warrior.”\r\n\r\n“He can handle both pen and sword, and he hath also prophetical gifts.”\r\n\r\nCrispus was naturally somewhat surprised at this last observation.\r\n\r\n“What prophecy hath he made?”\r\n\r\n“Why, this. Though he so bravely defended Jotapata against us, he\r\nnevertheless told its inhabitants that the city was destined to be\r\ntaken on the forty-seventh day of the siege, and so it came to pass.\r\nOh!” he continued in answer to Crispus’ look of skepticism, “I know\r\nit to be true, for I made careful inquiry among the captives, and all\r\ntestified that from the very beginning Josephus had foretold that\r\nJotapata would fall on the forty-seventh day.”\r\n\r\nWhat was very wonderful to Vespasian seemed simple enough to Crispus.\r\nIf Josephus, as was very likely, had formed the secret purpose of going\r\nover to the Roman side, it would not be difficult for him to prolong\r\nthe defense of such a rock-fortress as Jotapata till the forty-seventh\r\nday. The character gained as prophet on this occasion might stand him\r\nin good stead with the Roman general; in point of fact it had already\r\nso served him. Crispus could not help thinking that the man to whom\r\nhe had so much reason to be grateful, was, nevertheless, a somewhat\r\nambiguous character.\r\n\r\nGlancing along the shore, Crispus saw that the “prophet” had halted in\r\nhis walk by the chariot of Berenice, and was now conversing both with\r\nthat princess and with Titus. As the three were holding their heads\r\nclose together it may be inferred that the conversation was a very\r\nimportant one.\r\n\r\nIts purport became apparent to Crispus ere many hours were past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                        THE MAKING OF AN EMPEROR\r\n\r\n\r\nCrispus had the high honor of dining that night in the tent of\r\nVespasian with a select company of tribunes, Terentius Rufus being of\r\nthe number.\r\n\r\nTitus was, of course, present. His office of second in command, added\r\nto the glory gained by him in the Galilæan campaign, had disposed\r\nhim to adopt a somewhat lofty air towards his former friends and\r\nacquaintances; but Crispus had acquired the Christian grace of\r\nhumility, and the patronage that he might have resented in his pagan\r\ndays now afforded him matter only for a little quiet amusement.\r\n\r\nLet Titus receive his just due, however; though Berenice had earnestly\r\npressed him to persuade Vespasian to exclude Crispus from the army\r\nintended to act against Jerusalem, he had declined the task as an\r\nungenerous one. “If Crispus wishes to play the soldier, I am not the\r\nman to prevent him,” he said, an answer that considerably mortified the\r\nproud princess, as showing that Titus was not quite the plastic clay\r\nshe had thought him.\r\n\r\nThe fare provided by Vespasian for his guests was simple, as became the\r\ntastes of the general, and they sat to it.\r\n\r\n“I hate the effeminate habit of reclining at meals,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe conversation at table naturally turned upon the war, and Crispus,\r\nwho knew little of the then state of Jerusalem, received some\r\nenlightenment from Vespasian.\r\n\r\n“True is the saying,” said he, “that those whom the gods wish to\r\ndestroy they first make mad. Listen to what is happening at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n“Simon of Gerasa, disgusted that his great services should be passed\r\nover by the Sanhedrim while Eleazar was rewarded with the government of\r\na province, retired from Jerusalem; and, collecting a numerous body of\r\nfollowers, took to brigandage again.\r\n\r\n“Whilst Eleazar was administering the affairs of Idumæa, a certain\r\nambitious Zealot seized the opportunity to make himself master of the\r\ntemple; by a singular confusion of names this new captain is called\r\nEleazar.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime that fierce Zealot, John of Giscala, defeated by us\r\nin Galilee, fled to Jerusalem, where, becoming powerful, he played the\r\ntyrant, putting the rich to death, and seizing their wealth.\r\n\r\n“The high priest Matthias sought to free the miserable people by\r\ncalling in the aid of Simon; he came, but was unable to expel John.\r\n\r\n“The result is that the city is now groaning beneath the tyranny of\r\nthree factions.\r\n\r\n“Simon rules in Zion, with the Tower of Phasaelus for his palace; John\r\nholds the Lower City, and the outer courts of the temple; Eleazar keeps\r\njealous guard over the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n“These three Zealots, each aiming at sovereignty, wage war with one\r\nanother by night and by day.\r\n\r\n“Titus would have me march to Jerusalem at once, but why should I, when\r\nthey are doing our work so effectually? At sight of us, faction would\r\ndisappear; they would unite their arms against the common enemy. No;\r\nlet them go on with their internecine warfare till two of the factions\r\nare exterminated, and then we will deal with the survivor.”\r\n\r\n“Sound policy!” commented Rufus.\r\n\r\nCrispus, with his Christianized way of thinking, could not help\r\nseeing in the terrible state of the city the working out of a Divine\r\nretribution. The people that had cried, “Not this man, but Barabbas,”\r\ndesiring that a murderer might be granted to them, were now delivered\r\nover to the rule of murderers. “The assassin’s dagger was to sway the\r\nlast councils of their dying nationality.”\r\n\r\nRufus now added _his_ contribution to the story of Israel’s degradation.\r\n\r\n“And, that they might not have a moralist perpetually rebuking them\r\nfor their misdoings, the Zealots of Eleazar’s party deposed the high\r\npriest Matthias; and, calling for the register of priests, they broke\r\nthrough all precedent by casting lots for the office. The lot fell upon\r\nan obscurity named Phannias, a rustic so illiterate as scarcely to know\r\nwhat the high priesthood meant. Yet, they brought him from his native\r\nvillage; and, putting the sacred vestments upon him, instructed him how\r\nto act, finding matter for laughter and sport in the many blunders that\r\nhe made.”\r\n\r\nAgain the finger of Divine retribution! The high priesthood, that had\r\nmocked at the Crucifixion, had itself become a subject for mockery, a\r\nthing of scorn.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to his surprise, Crispus discovered that Vespasian at the end\r\nof his day’s labor would sometimes find relaxation in listening to the\r\ndiscourses of Josephus upon Jewish history and Jewish philosophy. He\r\nchose to do so on this present occasion; and, accordingly, after the\r\nrepast was over, a centurion was dispatched to bring in the captive.\r\n\r\nHe came, linked as usual to the guardian soldier, and advanced with\r\nan air meant to be solemn and dignified, but which in Crispus’ view\r\nwas pompous only; nay, contradictory as it may seem, beneath this air\r\nof importance there was lurking an undercurrent of obsequiousness and\r\nservility that set Crispus against him. If ever man was sycophant this\r\nman was!\r\n\r\n“We have sent for you,” began Vespasian, “to hear you discourse for a\r\ntime upon the history and laws of your nation.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, thou honorest our holy books by wishing to derive instruction\r\nfrom them. But, to-night--to-night, I would speak, not of the past, but\r\nof the future.”\r\n\r\n“Of which he knows no more than you or I,” whispered Rufus to Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Sire, when the Almighty created the seventy nations of the earth he\r\ngave to each its peculiar gift; to the Roman, sovereignty in war, and\r\nto the Greek, supremacy in art; to the Egyptian, depth in wisdom,\r\nand to the Hebrew, the power of prophecy. To us are granted at times\r\nglimpses of the future, prevision denied to other races. Did I not show\r\nthe knowledge of the seer by declaring that Jotapata would fall on the\r\nforty-seventh day of the siege? And now again do I lift the veil that\r\nhides the future. The God of our fathers hath revealed to me that great\r\nthing which shall come to pass.”\r\n\r\nHe advanced a step, accompanied necessarily by the soldier; and,\r\nfalling on his knees before Vespasian, he touched the ground with his\r\nforehead, saying, as he made this Oriental salutation:\r\n\r\n“HAIL, CÆSAR THAT IS TO BE!”\r\n\r\nAs if a chasm had suddenly yawned at his feet, Vespasian started back\r\nin an amazement so obviously genuine as to show plainly that this\r\ntreasonable notion was being sprung upon him for the first time.\r\n\r\nCrispus shared in Vespasian’s amazement, as did most of the other\r\nofficers present. Titus was the only one that showed no surprise; one\r\nmight have thought that he had been expecting something of this kind;\r\nhe sat with his eyes keenly attentive to his father’s face.\r\n\r\nCrispus could not help thinking that this little tableau was not a\r\nspontaneous ebullition on the part of Josephus, but a premeditated\r\npiece of acting, primarily due to the scheming brain of Berenice, and\r\nseconded by the ambitious hopes of Titus.\r\n\r\nThe deep silence was broken by the voice of Vespasian, who spoke with\r\nstern indignation.\r\n\r\n“No more of this. Thou talkest treason--treason to the reigning\r\nemperor.”\r\n\r\nTitus’ face became clouded.\r\n\r\n“If it be treason to declare the will of God, then am I talking\r\ntreason,” said Josephus.\r\n\r\n“Peace! I and the legions have sworn to uphold the throne of Vitellius.”\r\n\r\n“They took the oath with great reluctance, however,” observed Titus,\r\n“and are repenting of it. Their dissatisfaction grows from day to day.”\r\n\r\n“Their dissatisfaction shall not divert me from the path of duty.”\r\n\r\n“Seek not,” said Josephus, “to resist your destiny. Cæsar you will be,\r\nin spite of yourself. For so is it written in our sacred scriptures,\r\nthat one arising in Judæa shall obtain the empire of the world.”[20]\r\n\r\nCrispus, in spite of the debt he owed Josephus, could not conceal his\r\nscorn at this amazing perversion of Messianic prophecy, a perversion\r\nthat showed to what depth of sycophancy the soul of this priest and\r\nPharisee could descend. That the sacred predictions of Isaiah should\r\nreceive their fulfillment in the elevation of a heathen soldier to\r\nthe throne of the Cæsars was to the Hebrew mind an interpretation so\r\nblasphemous that if Josephus had ventured to assert it among a circle\r\nof his own countrymen he would most assuredly have been torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, however, he was safe from such a fate; and if\r\nhe himself did not believe in his own statement what mattered, if the\r\nlie could but accomplish his purpose?\r\n\r\n“Rise,” said Vespasian sternly, for during all this time Josephus\r\nhad been kneeling. The captive arose; and Vespasian, turning to his\r\nofficers, asked in a tone of pleasantry: “How shall I punish this knave\r\nfor urging me to treason?”\r\n\r\nRufus answered him.\r\n\r\n“Give him his freedom on the day that you become Cæsar. If he hath\r\nprophesied truly his freedom is bound to come, and if not----”\r\n\r\nVespasian slapped his thigh with a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n“By Castor, a just sentence! As thou sayest, so shall it be.”\r\n\r\nA close observer might have detected in the “prophet’s” expression\r\na certain uneasiness suggestive of the idea that he was by no means\r\nconfident of the fulfillment of his words.\r\n\r\n“Retire,” said Vespasian, whose desire for Hebrew history had vanished.\r\n“I will hear thee no more to-night.”\r\n\r\nSo Josephus departed; but when Titus began to comment upon his\r\nvaticination, Vespasian forbade him with so stern an air that Titus at\r\nonce dropped the subject; and when, later, a centurion looked in to ask\r\nthe watchword for the night, Vespasian wrote upon the tessera the word\r\n“FIDELITAS.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe throne of the Cæsars!\r\n\r\nDespite Vespasian’s repudiation--a repudiation made at the time in all\r\nsincerity--it became evident within the space of a few days that the\r\nseed sown in his mind by Josephus was beginning to germinate.\r\n\r\nUnder the haunting spell of a new and splendid ambition, he became\r\nmoody, restless, uneasy. Shunning the daily exercises of the army\r\nhe took long walks, communing with himself in lonely woods. Deep in\r\nthought, he would stare vacantly when addressed; one had to speak twice\r\nor thrice ere he understood. At times he was heard to murmur, “I will\r\nnot do this thing,” and his officers would look at each other, well\r\nknowing what thing was meant.\r\n\r\nOne morning, as if wishful to escape from his vexing thoughts, he\r\nmounted a horse and rode mile after mile along the shore towards\r\nthe point where the long ridge of Carmel, intercepting the maritime\r\nroad, thrusts a rocky bluff into the sea. In this wild gallop he was\r\nattended by his staff-officers, Crispus and Rufus being of the number.\r\n\r\nArrived at the foot of the mount, Vespasian, either as wishing to take\r\na survey of the country around, or moved perhaps by a desire to show\r\nwhat the agility of a man of sixty could accomplish, resolved to make\r\nthe ascent; and soon he and his staff were toiling on foot up the\r\ncraggy path that wound through forests of pine, oak, and olive to the\r\npoint\r\n\r\n  “_Where Carmel’s flowery top perfumes the skies._”\r\n\r\nThe glorious panorama presented by the mountainous landscape and\r\nthe dark-blue sea well rewarded them for their climb. The officers\r\nwere particularly interested in pointing out to Crispus the various\r\nhill-fortresses of Galilee--Giscala, Tabor, Jotapata--subdued by their\r\narms in the campaign of the previous year.\r\n\r\nAs the staff moved first this way and then that, following the steps of\r\nVespasian, they turned the corner of a crag, and came suddenly upon a\r\nstately figure in a flowing white robe, who with folded arms was gazing\r\nsilently and pensively seaward. Obviously, he was a priest, since there\r\nwas in attendance upon him a young boy holding in his hands what seemed\r\nan acerra, or box containing incense. Near by, formed from a number of\r\nrough unhewn stones, was an altar, upon which lay a few dried shavings\r\nof cedar-wood.\r\n\r\nThe man was not quite a stranger to Crispus; he had seen him, or rather\r\nhad caught a fleeting glimpse of him, on the previous evening, holding\r\nconverse with Titus in a lonely spot at some distance from the camp.\r\nCrispus had come upon the pair unawares, and it seemed to him that\r\nTitus was not altogether pleased at being detected in company with this\r\npriest, though what there was to be vexed at it would be hard to say.\r\n\r\nOn hearing footsteps the priest turned, and caught sight of the armed\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n“Who art thou?” he asked of Vespasian, as being evidently the chief of\r\nthe band.\r\n\r\n“I am Flavius Vespasian.”\r\n\r\n“I know not the name.”\r\n\r\n“And this is fame?” smiled Vespasian. “To be unknown after so many\r\nvictories in this Galilæan province!”\r\n\r\n“Hast thou dropped from the moon,” asked Rufus, “not to have heard the\r\nname of the great Vespasian?”\r\n\r\n“Content with my grotto,” said the priest, pointing to a cave\r\nin the face of the rock, “and with this altar, I stir not from\r\nCarmel,”--Crispus, remembering where he had seen him last, wondered at\r\nthis speech, but held his peace,--“hence I know nothing of the affairs\r\nof men. If thou art some great one of the earth, the gods teach thee to\r\nuse thy power well.”\r\n\r\n“To what deity is this altar erected?” asked Vespasian.\r\n\r\n“To the god Carmelus, the tutelary genius of this mountain.”\r\n\r\n“Hath he no image nor temple?”\r\n\r\n“None. This altar--’tis composed of twelve stones--is alone acceptable\r\nto him. Such hath been his worship from ancient days.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art about to offer incense to thy god, I perceive. We will join\r\nin thy worship. Offer on our behalf as well as on thine own.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that the superstitiously devout Vespasian doffed his helmet,\r\nin which act he was imitated by the rest, save Crispus, who drew aside\r\nfrom a ceremony incompatible with his Christian faith.\r\n\r\nRufus, observing that the priest apparently lacked the means of\r\nkindling a fire, offered him his own flint and steel, but they were\r\nwaved aside by the priest.\r\n\r\n“Our rites forbid such method,” said he. “The wood must be kindled not\r\nby ordinary means, but by the pure fire of heaven.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he produced a thick glass lens, with which he proceeded to\r\nfocus the sun’s rays upon the cedar-wood.\r\n\r\nCrispus, whose Christian training among the learned brethren of Tarsus\r\nand Ephesus had embraced the study of the Greek Septuagint, murmured to\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n“Mount Carmel? an altar of twelve stones? fire from heaven? This deity\r\nCarmelus is none other than Elijah in a heathen guise!”\r\n\r\nIt was not long ere the wood began first to smolder and then to break\r\ninto a flame. The feat was one as common in that age as in this, but\r\nbeing new to Vespasian, he looked on as though it were a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe attendant boy now held forth the acerra, and the priest, taking\r\nfrom it some grains of incense, cast them upon the fire.\r\n\r\nAs the strong fragrance became diffused around the priest began the\r\nchanting of an invocation which fell with a somewhat weird effect upon\r\nthe ears of the Romans, being delivered in the Phœnician, a tongue not\r\nunderstood by them.\r\n\r\n“Now, how know we that this fellow is not cursing us?” muttered Rufus.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the priest continued to cast fresh incense upon the\r\naltar. It seemed that the sacrifice was scarcely acceptable to the god\r\nCarmelus, for the fire was dull and smoky, always deemed a bad omen.\r\n\r\nThen, all in a moment, there was a change.\r\n\r\nA tongue of flame sprang up, high and brilliant, and lasting for\r\nseveral moments.\r\n\r\nAt the first leap of the fire the priest turned and stared hard at\r\nVespasian, as though that general had become suddenly invested with a\r\nnew and strange interest.\r\n\r\n“Vespasian--if that be thy name--whatever project thou now hast in thy\r\nmind, whether it be the enlargement of thy house, the augmentation of\r\nthy lands, or the increase of thy slaves, the Fates are preparing for\r\nthee a splendid seat, a large territory, a multitude of men.”[21]\r\n\r\nThe Roman officers, aware of the thought that was then paramount in the\r\nmind of their general, looked significantly at each other.\r\n\r\n“What is thy name?” asked Vespasian.\r\n\r\n“What thine shalt be--Basilides.”\r\n\r\nNow this name is, by interpretation, a king; and therefore Vespasian\r\nwas not a little startled to find this Phœnician seer hinting, and\r\nthat not obscurely, at the same high destiny assured him by Josephus.\r\nSurely, since there had been no previous concert between them, that\r\nmust be true which was prophesied by Hebrew priest and by Phœnician\r\npriest alike?\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the long ride back to camp, Crispus had ample time\r\nto review the incident that had just happened, and he saw in it not\r\nthe hand of the gods, but the trickery of man, the man in this case\r\nbeing Titus, who by subtle devices was luring his father on to make an\r\nattempt for the imperial throne.\r\n\r\nVespasian on the previous evening had announced his intention of\r\nvisiting Carmel on the morrow, and it had therefore been a very easy\r\nmatter for Titus to obtain the collusion of the priest Basilides for\r\nthe purpose of playing upon the superstitious feelings of Vespasian.\r\nThe sudden springing up of the flame upon the altar was a result easily\r\nobtainable by concealing a grain of fat among the incense. Titus was\r\nthe real source of this “divine sign,” as well as of the ambiguous but\r\nsignificant oracle delivered by Basilides.\r\n\r\nCrispus hesitated whether to enlighten Vespasian as to how he was being\r\nduped into believing himself to be a recipient of divine signs, but\r\nfinally resolved to hold his peace. What mattered it how Vespasian\r\nwas induced to revolt, whether by necessity, reason, or superstition,\r\nso long as he _did_ revolt? The rule of Vespasian would be infinitely\r\npreferable to that of the bestial Vitellius. And when Crispus, further\r\nreflecting that should a Flavian dynasty be established, and should\r\nTitus and Domitian--both at present childless--die without issue, the\r\nnext heir to the throne would be Flavius Clemens, an adherent of the\r\nfaith, he began to wonder whether a Christian Cæsar might not be among\r\nthe possibilities of the near future.\r\n\r\nSo here was Crispus wishing, like Berenice, to see Vespasian upon the\r\nthrone, though for a different reason--_she_ hoping to promote the\r\ncause of Judaism, _he_ hoping to promote the cause of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe course of the next few days furnished additional proof that subtle\r\nart was being employed to make Vespasian accept a position almost akin\r\nto that foretold of the Messiah.\r\n\r\n“Do I look like a god?” said he with a caustic smile, entering the tent\r\nof Rufus, who chanced to be alone.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell there was little in the homely, and even vulgar, aspect\r\nof Vespasian to suggest kinship with the Olympian divinities, but\r\nnaturally Rufus did not say so, contenting himself with asking the\r\ngeneral to explain his meaning. Then Vespasian, sitting down, proceeded\r\nto tell a strange story.\r\n\r\n“There hath been wont to sit at the fountain beside the gate of Cæsarea\r\na blind man. This morning as I was passing by the gate I saw a little\r\ncrowd gathered there, and among them this blind man. Guided by two\r\nfriends, he drew near, and, kneeling at my feet, implored me to cure\r\nhis blindness, declaring--and the two that were with him said the\r\nsame--that if I would but anoint clay with my spittle, and put the clay\r\nupon his eyes, he would there and then recover his sight.\r\n\r\n“I held my laughter and tried to reason him out of this belief, but\r\nthe more I argued the more earnest he became, and so I left him still\r\nkneeling. But as I walked away, the poor fellow’s lamentations became\r\nso pitiful that I could not help turning back, determined by making the\r\nactual experiment to convince the man of his folly. But, lo! as soon\r\nas the clay was washed from his eyes and I had pronounced the Hebrew\r\nword ‘_Ephphatha!_’--for it seems these spells are more efficacious\r\nwhen spoken in a barbarous language--the man cried out in an ecstasy of\r\ndelight that he could see![22]\r\n\r\n“‘A miracle! a miracle!’ cried the crowd.\r\n\r\n“‘So shalt thou give light to a dark world, O Vespasian,’[23] cried a\r\nvoice which I recognized as that of the priest Theomantes.\r\n\r\n“As for me, I doubted whether the man _had_ recovered his sight, but he\r\ngave proof of it by telling what number of coins lay on my palm, and\r\nthough I changed the number several times he did not once err.\r\n\r\n“There must be some divine efficacy in my touch became the opinion of\r\nthe crowd. The news flew from mouth to mouth, and as I stood amazed at\r\nmy own deed, there came to me a man whose right arm, as if paralyzed,\r\nhung stiff and motionless at his side.\r\n\r\n“‘I was a mason,’ said he, ‘earning my livelihood by my hands. I pray\r\nthee that thou wouldest make this arm whole like the other, that I may\r\nnot basely beg my bread.’\r\n\r\n“Compliant with his will I clasped his right hand firmly in my own, and\r\nafter a few moments he cried out that he had recovered the use of the\r\nwithered limb, and gave evidence of his words by freely gesticulating\r\nwith it. Now, Rufus, how explainest thou these marvels?”\r\n\r\nThese feats of healing, so analogous to those recorded in the gospel,\r\nas to suggest to the mind of more than one historian the suspicion that\r\nthey were purposely counterfeited with a view of investing Vespasian\r\nwith a sort of Messianic character, offered no difficulty whatever to\r\nthe pagan mind of Rufus.\r\n\r\n“It is clear to me, sire,” said he, fully believing in the truth of\r\nhis own words, “that the gods wish to point you out to mankind as one\r\ndistinguished by their special favor and destined to attain a dignity\r\nand splendor beyond that of ordinary mortals.”\r\n\r\nAnd the perplexed Vespasian, though the least conceited of men, was\r\ngradually driven to adopt this opinion in view of these strange\r\nhappenings.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, Mucianus, the Legate of Syria, arrived at\r\nCæsarea, having come direct thither from a brief visit paid to Rome.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by Tiberius Alexander, the prefect of Egypt. A\r\nJew by birth, a nephew, in fact, of the brilliant theologian Philo\r\nJudæus, Tiberius Alexander had deserted his ancestral faith for Grecian\r\npaganism, a conversion unique in the annals of Judaism.\r\n\r\nVespasian at once hastened from the camp to Cæsarea to pay his respects\r\nto Mucianus, who, besides being his lifelong friend, was also his\r\nsuperior in office.\r\n\r\nThe two illustrious visitors had accepted the hospitality of Berenice,\r\nand it was in the palace of that intriguing princess that Vespasian\r\nand Titus met them in a consultation upon which hung the destiny of an\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n“The senate of Rome,” began Mucianus, “loathes the rule of the bestial\r\nVitellius and his brutal soldiery. Shall I tell you what are likewise\r\nthe secret whisperings of the people in the forum? ‘Would to the gods\r\nthat Vespasian would deliver us from this glutton, who has already\r\nspent seven million sesterces upon his stomach!’ Vespasian, you have\r\nbut to proclaim yourself Cæsar here in Judæa, and Rome--yea, and all\r\nthe provinces, will rise in your favor. I have here a list, and ’tis\r\na long one, of Roman patricians who have sworn to me that they are\r\nwilling to risk their lives and fortunes in your cause.”\r\n\r\nVespasian, having listened to all this, and much more of like import,\r\nshowed his indifference to the imperial throne by offering it to\r\nMucianus! A plain, sensible man, and a born soldier, Vespasian cared\r\nlittle who was Cæsar so long as he himself should hold the chief\r\nmilitary command.\r\n\r\nBut however much Mucianus may have desired the purple he knew that\r\nhis chances of obtaining it were infinitely small, and he therefore\r\ncontinued to press its acceptance upon Vespasian.\r\n\r\n“Syria and its four legions are with you,” said he.\r\n\r\n“And I can promise you Egypt,” observed Tiberius Alexander. “As soon as\r\nyou are proclaimed Cæsar I will cause the legions of Alexandria to take\r\nthe oath of allegiance to you.”\r\n\r\n“And then your first act must be to stop the corn-ships from sailing,”\r\nsaid Berenice, who was taking part in these deliberations.\r\n\r\n“A wise policy!” commented Titus.\r\n\r\nThe possession of Egypt, as the conspirators well knew, was extremely\r\nimportant from a political point of view, the populace of Rome being\r\nalmost dependent for their existence upon the supplies of grain\r\nexported from Alexandria. Famine at the heart of the empire would not\r\nbe favorable to the cause of Vitellius.\r\n\r\n“With Syria, Palestine, and Egypt on your side,” pursued Mucianus,\r\n“you will occupy a continuous and united territory. Your rear you must\r\nsecure by an alliance with the Parthians. As to your front, by land it\r\nis accessible only by way of the Taurus mountains; occupy the Syrian\r\nand Cilician Gates, and you can bid defiance to any attack coming from\r\nthat quarter. As to your sea-front we have in Phœnicia the finest race\r\nof seamen in the world, and in the cedars of Libanus an inexhaustible\r\nsupply of timber for shipbuilding. Phœnicia falls within my province.\r\nBid me do it, and ere two months be out you shall have a fleet of\r\ntriremes that shall guard all coasts from Cilicia to Cyrene. Thus\r\nsecure, we may advance to attack Vitellius, or await him here, as may\r\nbest seem convenient to us.”\r\n\r\nBut Vespasian, prudent and cautious, still delayed his final answer.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after his withdrawal the remaining conclave, at Berenice’s\r\nsuggestion, determined to force the hand of the reluctant general, that\r\nprincess propounding an ingenious scheme for the purpose.\r\n\r\n“You, Titus,” said she, “must persuade all the soldiers in the camp to\r\nsalute Vespasian with the title of Cæsar.”\r\n\r\n“They want no persuading. The difficulty is that he’ll refuse to listen\r\nto them.”\r\n\r\n“He will be compelled.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“Vitellius will hear of it. He cannot with dignity pass over such\r\ntreason. He’ll demand that these disloyal legions be punished. In\r\ndeclining this task--for how can he punish a whole army?--Vespasian\r\nwill become an object of suspicion to Vitellius. He’ll be summoned\r\nto Rome; to go will be certain death. Therefore, if the legions here\r\npersist in crying ‘Hail, Cæsar!’ whenever Vespasian appears, he must\r\neither accept the title or be prepared for immediate ruin.”\r\n\r\n“Princess, you have it,” cried Mucianus admiringly. “The plan cannot\r\nfail. Now, Titus, do your part, whilst Alexander and I hasten to set\r\nour provinces in order.”\r\n\r\nThe conspirators departed to put their plan into operation.\r\n\r\nIt succeeded admirably.\r\n\r\nOn the third of July A.D. 69 Vespasian was proclaimed emperor by the\r\nlegions of Cæsarea. His elevation was everywhere received with delight.\r\nEmbassies from various cities and provinces hurried to Cæsarea,\r\nbringing addresses of congratulation and crowns of honor; within a\r\nmonth Vespasian had received the submission of all the East, with the\r\nexception of Jerusalem and its immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAnd the prophecy, long current in the East, not only among the Jews,\r\nbut likewise among other nations, that one coming from Judæa should\r\nobtain the empire of the world, was thought to have received its\r\nfulfillment at last!\r\n\r\nIt was decided at a council composed of Eastern statesmen and Roman\r\nwarriors that Mucianus should proceed by land against Italy, that Titus\r\nshould carry on the war against Jerusalem, and that Vespasian should\r\nretire to Alexandria, and there await the issue of events.\r\n\r\n“And now, O father,” said Titus, delighted at having attained the\r\nrank of Cæsar--for to be scrupulously exact that was his title as\r\nheir-apparent, the reigning emperor being called Augustus--“now, O\r\nfather, remember your promise and release Josephus from his bonds, else\r\nwill it be a shameful thing that the man who told beforehand of your\r\ncoming to empire, and hath been the minister of a divine message to\r\nyou, should still be retained in the condition of a captive.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the camp at Cæsarea that these words were spoken. So\r\nVespasian sent for Josephus, who came still wearing the chain that\r\nbound him to the guardian soldier.\r\n\r\nThe new emperor gave orders that the captive should be set at liberty;\r\nand accordingly the soldier was about to loose the chain when Titus\r\nintervened, suggesting that the chain should be _cut_ from him, this\r\nbeing the Roman method with such as were bound without just cause.\r\n\r\nThis advice being agreeable to Vespasian, a smith was sent for, a\r\nfellow strong and dexterous of arm, who cut the chain to pieces.\r\n\r\n“Josephus, thou art free,” exclaimed Vespasian, “and the citizenship of\r\nRome is thine.”\r\n\r\n“Call me no more Josephus,” said the liberated one, boldly venturing to\r\nassume the name of his imperial patron. “Henceforth let all men know me\r\nas Titus Flavius.”\r\n\r\n“Titus,” said Vespasian, referring to his son, “Titus has the glory of\r\nbeing Cæsar. Josephus has----”\r\n\r\n“Flavius, sire,” murmured the adopter of that name, remonstratingly.\r\n\r\n“Flavius, then, to please you. Flavius has received the honor of the\r\ncitizenship. What honor,” he continued, turning to Crispus, “what honor\r\nshall we confer upon you?”\r\n\r\nOn the point of replying that the emperor’s friendship was of itself a\r\nsufficient honor, Crispus paused, suddenly seized by a happy idea.\r\n\r\n“There is one favor I would ask, sire--a very simple one.”\r\n\r\n“Name it.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis of a private nature. I prefer to state it before you and Titus\r\nonly.”\r\n\r\nVespasian looked surprised. He gave a nod, and Josephus and the others\r\nwithdrew from the tent.\r\n\r\n“Now, Crispus, for what do you make request?”\r\n\r\n“It may not be known to you, sire, that I have a wife.”\r\n\r\nIt certainly was news to Vespasian, as his looks plainly showed.\r\nCrispus proceeded to relate in as few words as possible the story of\r\nhis wedding at Beth-tamar.\r\n\r\n“Eh! what is this?” said the old general, turning with a chiding air to\r\nTitus. “You were Crispus’ paranymph, and yet you have never told me of\r\nit. Fie on you! But what has this to do with the favor you would ask?”\r\ncontinued he, addressing Crispus.\r\n\r\n“You, sire, as emperor, are supreme in matters of the law. ’Tis yours\r\nto see that the terms of a contract be fulfilled. Therefore I ask\r\nthat when I discover this woman she shall be made to keep her nuptial\r\npledge.”\r\n\r\n“Find her, and if you want her, you shall have her, be she never so\r\nreluctant,” said Vespasian, smiling grimly. “Who is _she_ to refuse my\r\nbravest tribune?”\r\n\r\nIn that immoral age fidelity to a wife was a rare virtue, and one that\r\ncommended itself to honest old Vespasian.\r\n\r\n“You swear it, sire, that no man shall be permitted to take her from\r\nme?”\r\n\r\nVespasian was painfully impressed by the tense, earnest look of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“By the gods, it shall go ill with the man, if any such there be. He\r\nwho dares to take your wife from you shall be hanged on high--yea,\r\nthough he were my own son.”\r\n\r\n“Take it not amiss, sire, if I ask for that promise in writing.”\r\n\r\nWhile Vespasian, surprised yet compliant, was putting his promise into\r\ndocumentary form, Titus stood silent in the background.\r\n\r\nHis face at that moment was a study, and confirmed Crispus in the\r\nsuspicion he had long entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                   THE PRELIMINARIES OF A GREAT SIEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the spring of the year A.D. 70, nearly nine months after the\r\nelevation of Vespasian to the imperial throne, and still the Roman\r\nlegions, now under the sole command of Titus, tarried in their\r\nencampment at Cæsarea-by-the-sea.\r\n\r\nThe self-confident Zealots of Jerusalem began to doubt whether the\r\nenemy ever _would_ come within sight of the city again.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of their internecine warfare they were much interested\r\nin watching the progress of a new planet or comet, fiery red in color.\r\n\r\nIt first appeared in Pisces, the constellation which, in the astral\r\nlore of that age, was supposed to be connected with the fortunes of\r\nJudæa. Night after night it mounted higher, and ever higher, in the\r\nsky, seeming to be making for a point directly above the holy city.\r\n\r\nAt the very first sight of it the multitude had cried with one voice,\r\n“_The star of the Messiah!_” Ere long it became so distinct and bright\r\nas to be plainly discernible in the daytime, and crowds gathered\r\nat street corners to stare at what they devoutly believed to be a\r\nheaven-sent sign.\r\n\r\nThe glorious day foretold by the prophets was at hand when the Jews,\r\nwith the assistance of the heavenly powers, should reign supreme over\r\nall the nations of the earth. And when the star, growing more plain,\r\nwas seen to take the shape of a sword[24] with its blade pointing in\r\nthe direction of the Roman Camp at Cæsarea, who could doubt that it\r\nportended the doom of those who were threatening the holy city?\r\n\r\n“There shall come a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of\r\nIsrael.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the text upon which Rabbi Simeon ben Gamaliel proposed to\r\ngive a midrash or sermon, an announcement that attracted to the Royal\r\nSynagogue a congregation larger than any previously seen within its\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nDevout joy was at first the prevailing keynote of the assembly; but,\r\nafter the preliminary prayers, a strange uneasiness fell upon them\r\nwhen it was discovered that the prescribed parashoth or lesson for\r\nthe day--and there could be no omitting it!--was that section of the\r\nPentateuch containing the solemn and thrilling words addressed to the\r\nnation by the great Hebrew lawgiver on the eve of his death.\r\n\r\nAs the chazan began his reading the sunlight without became clouded,\r\nand a gloom pervaded the edifice, a gloom that seemed to deepen with\r\neach successive moment.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, customary to receive the reading of the Law in\r\nreverential silence, but a silence so tense as the present had never\r\nbeen known in this synagogue. With bated breath and with eyes fastened\r\non the chazan’s face they listened to the voice of the divine lawgiver\r\nsounding down to them through the corridors of time.\r\n\r\n“The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of\r\nthe earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou\r\nshalt not understand. A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not\r\nregard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young.... And he\r\nshall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls\r\ncome down, wherein thou trustedst.... And thou shalt eat the fruit of\r\nthine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, in the\r\nsiege and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress\r\nthee.... In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at\r\neven thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine\r\nheart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which\r\nthou shalt see.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the assembly, hitherto as motionless and as silent as the\r\ndead, impulsively started to their feet, with fear stamped upon their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, the words of the Law, awful though they were, that\r\nhad moved the worshipers, but a tumult coming from the streets in the\r\nvicinity of the synagogue.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous few moments the air had resounded with the running\r\nof feet intermingled with the sound of voices.\r\n\r\nThose voices, confused at first, had now become clearly audible.\r\nRolling upward to the skies in accents of surprise and fear there\r\npealed again and again the startling cry:\r\n\r\n“THE ROMANS! THE ROMANS!”\r\n\r\nThe sight of the Roman vanguard, glittering upon the northern\r\nheights of Scopus, though it might put fear into the hearts of the\r\ncommon people, served only to evoke the scorn of the Zealots. Their\r\nastonishing victory over Cestius, and the fact that for three years\r\nno attempt had been made to recover the city, had given them an\r\nexaggerated notion of their own prowess.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots of Galilee might yield; those of Jerusalem were invincible!\r\n\r\n“They are the same sheep,” scoffed Simon, “but with a new shepherd.”\r\n\r\nFor a long time the Zealots and the people, massed upon the northern\r\nwall of the city, continued to watch the distant host, who seemed to be\r\noccupied in forming an encampment. Suddenly a shout arose. Something\r\nwas seen to separate itself from the common body, and to move forward\r\nquickly towards the city amid a cloud of dust. That something on a\r\nnearer approach proved to be a detachment of cavalry, six hundred\r\nstrong, led by Titus in person, who, coming not to fight but merely to\r\nreconnoiter, rode bareheaded, having left both helmet and breastplate\r\nbehind. By his side rode that Jewish apostate, Tiberius Alexander,\r\nwho, having at one time been procurator of Judæa, was in a position to\r\nexplain to Titus the topography of the city.\r\n\r\nA sea of faces glared at them along the whole extent of the northern\r\nwall; the battlements of Antonia, the porticoes of the temple, the\r\ndistant ramparts of Mount Zion were similarly crowded; in all the wide\r\ncity there was neither wall nor tower, neither roof nor window, but\r\nshowed a cluster of human beings. Their excited cries blending together\r\ncame to the ears of Titus like the restless murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n“How many people doth the city hold, think you?” he asked of Alexander.\r\n\r\n“My spies report the number to be a million--yea, and a hundred\r\nthousand beyond that. ’Tis the eve of the passover, and Jews from every\r\nprovince of the empire have come up to worship.”\r\n\r\n“A million? Ye gods! Has this nation appointed a rendezvous for its own\r\ndestruction? But as to the fighting men?”\r\n\r\n“All will fight, even children, if it be to defend their city and\r\ntheir religion. The women and girls will weave their hair into ropes,\r\nif ropes be needed. The priests themselves will arm should the war\r\napproach the temple.”\r\n\r\n“Little care I for such foes. My concern is with those who have any\r\nknowledge of actual warfare.”\r\n\r\n“Why, as to that, Eleazar guards the holy house with 2,400 Zealots;\r\nJohn, your old opponent in Galilee, keeps the cloisters with 6,000. But\r\nSimon, who holds Mount Zion, is the man to be feared. He hath 15,000\r\nfierce spirits, so fanatically devoted to him, that each would fall on\r\nhis own sword did he but command it.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-three thousand fighting men? Well, we have more than double\r\nthat number with us.”\r\n\r\n“Your number may be tenfold theirs, but such superiority avails\r\nnothing in view of their impregnable position.--As you see, O Cæsar,”\r\nhe continued, pointing first to the city, and then to a map that he\r\ncarried, a map drawn by the hand of Josephus, “Jerusalem occupies the\r\nsouthern tongue of a rocky plateau; on the east, on the west, on the\r\nsouth, its walls look down upon ravines and valleys whose slopes are\r\ntoo steep to be scaled by an army; it is from this quarter only that\r\nthe attack can be made.”\r\n\r\nTitus recognized the fact at a glance. The city, the real city--namely,\r\nthe stronghold of Zion--was assailable only from the north, but the way\r\nto it was barred by huge ramparts.\r\n\r\nThree gigantic lines of masonry were drawn east and west across the\r\nplateau.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was the wall directly facing them, called by the Jews the\r\nThird Wall, as being the latest built.\r\n\r\nThis, when breached or surmounted, opened the way into the northern\r\nsuburb of Bezetha or New-town. Marching through Bezetha, the Romans\r\nwould come to the Second or Middle Wall, which, when taken, would admit\r\nthem to Acra or the Lower City; passing through Acra, they would find\r\nthemselves staring helplessly up at the scarped cliff of Mount Zion or\r\nthe Upper City, whose edge was surmounted by a wall so lofty that the\r\nTitans themselves might have despaired of scaling it.\r\n\r\nBut ere any attempt could be made upon Zion, it would be necessary\r\nfirst to take the towering rock-citadel of Antonia, and, secondly, the\r\nlofty temple-fortress, otherwise while besieging Zion they would be\r\ncontinually exposed to a flank attack from these two strongholds.\r\n\r\n“You have to deal,” said Tiberius Alexander, “not with one city, but\r\nwith five cities. A fivefold siege lies before us.”\r\n\r\nAs Titus glanced with the eye of a trained soldier from point to point,\r\nand took in the nature of the defenses, natural and artificial, he\r\nbegan to realize the stupendous nature of the task imposed upon him.\r\n\r\nHaughtily enthroned upon its mountain-rock, this Oriental city with its\r\ngirdling _enceinte_ of walls, towers and bastions, seemed as if built\r\nwith set purpose to triumph over every device that could be brought\r\nagainst it by the military science of the West.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt about it: it was THE STRONGEST CITY IN THE WORLD,\r\nand if adequately provisioned, and defended with due care, was\r\nabsolutely impregnable.\r\n\r\n“And I have wagered Mucianus,” said Titus grimly, “that I’ll take it\r\nwithin seven weeks.”\r\n\r\nAlexander gravely shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Twice seven weeks will pass--yea, and three times seven weeks--ere the\r\neagles fly over Zion.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this reconnoitering, a gate by the Women’s Tower\r\nopened, and the Zealots poured forth in such numbers that the little\r\nRoman band, after holding their ground for a time, deemed it prudent to\r\nbeat a retreat.\r\n\r\nGreat was the delight of the Jews. Cæsar himself had been seen to fly!\r\nIt was the promise and presage of more glorious victories.\r\n\r\nEarly next day the Roman army advanced to within a mile of the northern\r\nwall of the city, and there began the construction of two huge camps.\r\n\r\nThe forces of Titus consisted of four legions, the fifth or\r\n_Macedonia_, the tenth or _Fretensis_, the twelfth or _Fulminata_\r\n(memorable for its flight under Cestius), and the fifteenth or\r\n_Apollinaris_.\r\n\r\nIn imperial times the legion usually consisted of 6,000 men, all\r\nRoman citizens, none other being admitted to its proud ranks; but as\r\neach legion was always accompanied by an equal number of auxiliaries,\r\nlevied from the subject nations, together with 300 cavalry; and as\r\nseveral petty kings of the East (including Agrippa) had joined in the\r\nexpedition, each bringing with him his own little army, the forces\r\narrayed against Jerusalem must be stated at a figure considerably in\r\nexcess of 50,000.\r\n\r\nFlashing in the morning sunlight, the various squadrons of this vast\r\nhost, horse and foot, heavy-armed and light-armed, deployed into\r\nnever-ending lines upon the brow of Olivet and upon the descent of\r\nScopus; and as the Jews gazed from their walls upon the long array of\r\neagles and standards bearing the letters S.P.Q.R., they realized the\r\nfull meaning of the expression “terrible as an army with banners.”\r\n\r\nAs the battering-rams and other ponderous machines used in sieging\r\nwere mounted upon wheels, whose revolution required a comparatively\r\neven surface, the first work of the legionaries, after forming their\r\ncamp, was to level the ground between their lines and the foot of the\r\nnorthern wall.\r\n\r\nThis fore-suburb, ere the Roman engineers set to work, was a scene of\r\nsylvan beauty, consisting of groves and watercourses, gardens and fair\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\nNow all was ruthlessly swept away: the trees fell before the ax; the\r\nwatercourses were destroyed; the houses demolished; even the deep and\r\nshady glens were no more, being filled up with the picturesque crags\r\nthat were wont to overshadow them.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the troops labored at the rocky ground with iron\r\ninstruments, others were employed in bringing up from the valley of\r\nCedron countless baskets laden with pebbles and earth; these were used\r\nin filling up the inequalities of the surface, the soldiers stamping\r\nthe materials firmly with their feet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a cloud of missiles discharged at them from the ramparts,\r\nin spite of the sudden and daring sallies made by Simon and his men,\r\nthe Romans contrived, in the course of a few days, to transform the\r\npicturesque fore-suburb into a dreary, uniform level.\r\n\r\nWhile the Roman operations were proceeding without, the Jews within the\r\ncity were preparing to celebrate the passover, memorable as being THE\r\nLAST IN THEIR HISTORY as a nation; memorable, too, for the armed fray\r\nthat accompanied it.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of Nisan, Eleazar and his party opened the gates\r\nof the upper temple to admit those bringing the paschal lambs. The\r\ncautions previously exercised by him to exclude the Zealots of the\r\nother two factions seem to have been wanting on this occasion. Members\r\nof John’s party, with weapons concealed beneath their garments,\r\ncontrived to enter in company with the multitude of foreign pilgrims,\r\nand drawing together in a compact body, they suddenly flung off their\r\nouter robes and appeared in the panoply of war. At this sight Eleazar’s\r\nfaction flew to arms, and a fierce mêlée took place around the golden\r\nhouse, innocent pilgrim and guilty Zealot alike falling fast. When\r\nthe fray ended, John of Giscala was master of all the temple. Eleazar\r\nhaving fallen, the survivors of his party consented to be absorbed in\r\nthat of the victor; and thus the three factions in the city were now\r\nreduced to two, the Johanneans and the Simonians.\r\n\r\nTo these Johanneans Simon now made appeal.\r\n\r\nStanding on the bridge that connected Mount Zion with the temple-hill,\r\nhe called for John, and when that chief appeared he thus addressed him:\r\n\r\n“Shall a house stand that is divided against itself? Why do we fight\r\neach other, making fine sport for the foe? We are, it seems, valiant\r\nagainst ourselves only, content to let the city be taken by our love of\r\nfaction. Let us lay aside our enmity, and join in opposing the common\r\nfoe.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art a subtle knave, Simon,” replied John. “Thou desirest me and\r\nmy forces to go with thee to the Wall of Agrippa that thy men in my\r\nabsence may seize upon the temple, for all know of thy desire to make\r\nthyself tyrant of the city. However, I will so far assist thee that\r\nsuch of my men as are so minded may go with thee, but as to myself and\r\ncertain other, we will remain behind to defend the temple.”\r\n\r\nAvailing themselves of the permission thus given, hundreds of John’s\r\nmen came forth from the temple to join with the Simonians in the\r\ndefense of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, having cleared the ground from all obstructions, were\r\nnow occupied in erecting opposite the northern wall a series of\r\nlofty banks, upon which to set the engines used in discharging\r\nmissile-weapons, for the higher the position of these engines the more\r\naccurate and the more deadly their aim.\r\n\r\nEach bank or agger was made of earth strengthened by beams of timber.\r\nDuring the erection of these banks, the Zealots were not content to\r\nlook idly on. Preceded by a veritable rain of stones discharged from\r\nthe ramparts, they poured forth by hundreds, armed with long poles\r\nterminating in iron hooks; with these they sought to pull apart the\r\nbeams composing the agger, with intent to bring down the whole mass.\r\n\r\nIn these sallies the Zealots came on with the rush of a whirlwind, each\r\nman ready to sacrifice his life provided only he could kill one of the\r\nenemy, or do but the least damage to the agger.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment, however, could they stay the progress of the work.\r\nThe Roman guard stationed in front of the banks drove back every onset;\r\nand at last the Jews, despairing of accomplishing their object, kept\r\nwithin their walls, and sallied forth no more.\r\n\r\nEach embankment, when finished, presented a vertical front to the\r\ncity, but the other side was inclined at a very low angle, in order\r\nto facilitate the mounting of the military engines: and gaps were\r\npurposely left in it to permit the passage of the battering-rams and\r\nthe movable towers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shrill réveille pealed through the Roman camp, rousing the\r\nlegionaries from their slumber.\r\n\r\nEvery man on waking turned his eyes towards the tent of Titus, and\r\nevery face gleamed with a grim satisfaction at sight of the scarlet\r\nmantle hoisted above it, the sign that the day was to be one of battle.\r\n\r\nAs the Roman host gazed upon the holy city rising fair and stately in\r\nthe golden light of an Eastern dawn, they were fain to confess that it\r\nwas a city worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nFrom its walls the tocsin of war was sounding in the shape of a\r\nsix-foot brazen gong, whose deep, sullen tone reverberated monotonously\r\non the morning air.\r\n\r\nThe whole northern rampart was alive with a multitude of Zealot\r\nwarriors moving to and fro, their shining armor obscured at times by\r\nfaint columns of blue smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Romans knew well what that smoke meant.\r\n\r\nBehind those battlements burned fires, over which were slung cauldrons\r\nhissing with scalding water, boiling pitch, and molten lead!\r\n\r\nAt sight of this smoke the Romans merely smiled; but at sight of the\r\nmilitary engines, disposed at due intervals along the wall, they burned\r\nwith secret rage, being reminded of their tarnished honor, for these\r\nengines represented a triumph over Romans, having been captured, some\r\nfrom the camp of Cestius, and others from the Tower of Antonia and the\r\nPrætorium of Florus.\r\n\r\nMoving everywhere along the ramparts, now giving an order here, and\r\nnow a caution there, was seen the form of that brawny Titan, Simon the\r\nBlack, the very soul of battle, hatred of the Roman looking out from\r\nhis wild, dark eye. Over his armor he wore a wolfskin mantle with the\r\nshaggy side turned outwards, a mantle that suggested to his followers\r\nthe prophecy (for he came of the “little” tribe), “Benjamin shall ravin\r\nas a wolf.”\r\n\r\nEven those among the Romans that were most given to the despising of\r\nHebrew valor, were obliged to admit that in Simon they had a warrior\r\nworthy of their steel.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely morning, giving promise of a sultry noontide; a\r\ndazzling sun shone from a sky of deepest blue; far away on the horizon\r\nhung a pall of pearly white mist.\r\n\r\nAs a hush precedes the desert sandstorm, so upon the two armies there\r\nlay a strange stillness.\r\n\r\nIt was a sublime and thrilling spectacle this, of two nations\r\nfacing each other in arms--nay, an act in a Divine drama, the true\r\nsignificance of which was understood by none present, except by Crispus\r\nand the very few that were of like faith with him. The struggle\r\nwas more than it appeared upon the surface; it was not merely the\r\nsubjugation of a revolted city, but a battle betwixt two religions; the\r\nreligions, not, as might be thought, Judaism and Paganism, but Judaism\r\nand Christianity. The legions of Titus, though they knew it not, were\r\ntruly soldiers of the Cross, continuing the work to which they had been\r\ndivinely pre-ordained--_the work of the Church!_\r\n\r\nFor the Romans, by uniting the nations of the civilized world under one\r\ngovernment, by establishing a universal peace--the “_Romana pax_” that\r\nwas the just boast of their orators; by clearing the sea of corsairs,\r\nand the land from banditti; by linking all parts of their empire with\r\na series of splendid roads; by diffusing among their provinces a\r\nknowledge of the Greek language; had created conditions such as had\r\nnever before existed in the world’s history: conditions that were\r\nabsolutely essential, if the Church were to make quick progress;\r\nconditions that enabled the evangelist, knowing one language only, to\r\ntravel in safety and preach the faith from the banks of the Euphrates\r\nto the Pillars of Hercules.\r\n\r\nThe Roman legionaries, paradoxical as it may sound, were the coadjutors\r\nof the apostles. They were now about to put the final touches to their\r\nwork by demolishing the temple, whose further existence was an obstacle\r\nto the free development of Christianity; and by acting as the sword of\r\nthe Lord against those who had cried, “His blood be on us and on our\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nA.D. 70 was the necessary sequel of A.D. 29; and he who refuses to\r\nsee a Divine Judgment in the fall of Jerusalem has yet to learn the\r\nelements of history.\r\n\r\nIgnorant of the high mission assigned to him, Titus, distinguished\r\nby a purple mantle and by the splendor of his gilded arms, had taken\r\nup his station upon the central agger. Beside him, and clothed in a\r\nmagnificent white robe, gold-embroidered, stood Theomantes, the priest\r\nof Jupiter Cæsarius, presiding at an altar of unhewn stones, upon which\r\nthere flamed a sacrificial ox. Titus and the Romans in the immediate\r\nvicinity of this altar were standing bareheaded in reverential attitude.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots upon the wall, keenly attentive to this religious ceremony,\r\nnoticed that Theomantes, as he stood with his arms raised in prayer to\r\nsome deity, kept his eyes fixed throughout upon their holy temple.\r\n\r\nA sudden suspicion fell upon them. They strained their ears in the hope\r\nof catching his utterance, though distance might well forbid that hope.\r\nFortune favored them, however. A breeze blowing from the north at that\r\nmoment wafted to their ears the word--JEHOVAH!--a word so sacred that\r\nit was seldom uttered even by the Jews themselves, and never in the\r\npresence of a Gentile.\r\n\r\nHow came this pagan priest to know the true name of God, and why was he\r\npraying to Him?\r\n\r\nThen the full meaning of the scene was borne in upon them. It was the\r\nceremony called by the Romans the Evocation.[25] It was the custom of\r\nthat people at the beginning of a siege to invoke the tutelary deity of\r\nthe invested city, inviting him not to be made a prisoner, but to come\r\nforth and take up his abode among the divinities of the Roman Capitol.\r\nWithout such ceremony they would be fighting against the gods--an\r\nimpious deed!\r\n\r\nThe ceremony, ludicrous or blasphemous, according as one may view it,\r\nwas at all events unnecessary on the present occasion. The tutelary\r\nangels _had_ quitted the city, and Crispus was of those who had heard\r\ntheir departing voice.\r\n\r\nTo the Jews upon the wall, the affair was as blasphemy. Jehovah was\r\ntheir own peculiar heritage! That the heathen should dare pray to Him,\r\nabove all that they should call upon Him to quit the place where He had\r\nchosen to put His name forever, was a thing not to be borne.\r\n\r\nCalling for their most expert archer, they bade him shoot down the\r\nimpious Theomantes.\r\n\r\nBut the action was observed by the quick-eyed Rufus, who interposed his\r\nshield between the priest and the oncoming arrow.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards Titus tossed his baton high in air.\r\n\r\nAt that sight--the signal for battle--there rolled down the Roman lines\r\na shout that seemed to shake the very towers of the city, the thrilling\r\nwar-cry of “ROMA! ROMA!” and with that each man flew to his appointed\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe greatest siege in the world’s history had begun!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                         THE FIRST DAY’S FIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very edge of each agger there leaped up, as if by magic, a cloud\r\nof archers and slingers, who, setting up iron screens in front of\r\nthemselves, proceeded to direct their missiles upon the defenders of\r\nthe battlements.\r\n\r\nExpert as were these archers--Cretans all, a nation famed from Homeric\r\ntimes in the use of the bow--they were surpassed in accuracy of aim by\r\nthe slingers. These, natives of the Balearic Isles, had been trained to\r\ntheir work from very childhood, when their daily meal, set upon some\r\nhigh point, could not be obtained, unless brought down by themselves\r\nwith the sling. Hence a force of Baleares formed an adjunct to every\r\nRoman legion. Their missiles, consisting both of stones and leaden\r\nplummets, were discharged by a triple whirl of the sling; with a force\r\nso powerful that headpiece, breastplate, and buckler afforded little\r\nprotection; with a motion so swift that the leaden plummet, glowing in\r\nthe air, sometimes melted; with an aim so true that the slinger could\r\nnot only hit the face of a distant enemy, but could even hit whatever\r\npart of the face he chose. Not infrequently the missile bore some\r\ninsulting inscription; and Simon, picking up a stone that had very\r\nnearly brained him, found it marked with the message: “ΔΕΞΑΙ--Take\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\nThe slingers and archers were aided in their death-dealing business by\r\nthe workers of the catapults, machines which, framed somewhat upon the\r\nprinciple of the medieval crossbow, discharged gigantic javelins and\r\nbeams headed with iron.\r\n\r\nThe Jews did not remain passive under this attack. In the use of the\r\nbow and the sling they were almost as well skilled as their opponents,\r\nand returned the fire of the besiegers with a fire equally brisk.\r\n\r\nThe fray became more deadly as soon as the Romans had got their balistæ\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\nThese were huge machines, whose working part consisted of an\r\narrangement of levers and ropes, which, when forcibly drawn back and\r\nlet go, produced a tremendous recoil, sufficient to hurl ponderous\r\nstones to a distance of three furlongs, and farther.\r\n\r\nThese stones were discharged mainly for the purpose of carrying away\r\nthe battlements, turrets and parapet of the wall, so that, deprived of\r\ncover, the defenders would be compelled to quit the ramparts, since to\r\nremain there open and exposed would mean certain death at the hands of\r\nthe archers and slingers. The withdrawal of the defenders would be the\r\nsignal for the escalade.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty of these balistæ were now at work, making terrible\r\nhavoc, not only with battlement and parapet, but also with the lives\r\nof the Jewish people. Some of the stones hurled aloft exceeded three\r\nhundred pounds in weight, and had force sufficient to kill six men, if\r\ntaken in file. Josephus describes how he saw a man’s head struck clean\r\nfrom his shoulders and carried to a distance of three furlongs! Anyone\r\nstanding within a yard of such stone as it swept past was certain to be\r\nflung to earth by the accompanying rush of air.\r\n\r\nSuch was the effect of the ponderous rocks that now went whirling over\r\nthe ramparts, fifteen or twenty at a time, into the suburb of Bezetha,\r\ncrashing through the roof and wall of many a private dwelling, and\r\ntumbling it into ruins amid the wild shrieking of its hapless occupants.\r\n\r\nTo this artillery Simon sought to reply with the captured Roman\r\nbalistæ; but the Zealots, for lack of skill and practice, bungled so\r\nmiserably at the task as to evoke the laughter of the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhile this terrific fusillade was going on, a party of Romans began\r\nto push forward a pluteus--a sort of iron shed open at both ends and\r\nrunning upon wheels. As it moved along, the Romans walked beneath its\r\nroof, and were thus effectually screened against the missiles showered\r\nat them from the battlements.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pluteus touched the foot of the wall, the party within,\r\nkneeling down upon the ground, set to work vigorously with lever and\r\ncrow, endeavoring to loosen the lower courses of the masonry.\r\n\r\nStones and darts were powerless against a machine of this kind. But\r\nSimon’s fertile brain had devised a plan for defeating its operations.\r\nLiquid bitumen, in immense quantities, was flung upon the pluteus,\r\nand when all the ground beneath it and around it was flowing with the\r\nliquid, lighted torches were thrown down. In a flash the interior of\r\nthe pluteus as well as the air above and around became a flaming fire.\r\nWith terrible howlings the miserable Romans, their hair, beard, and\r\ngarments alight, rushed forth into the open, only to be shot dead by\r\nthe Jewish archers.\r\n\r\nWhat Simon had done once he was likely to do again. Titus, therefore,\r\nwhen informed of this incident gave orders to keep the plutei in\r\nreserve and to push forward the battering-rams.\r\n\r\nOne of these, by reason of its hugeness, excited the wonder, if not the\r\nfears, of the Zealots.\r\n\r\nIt was a wheeled tower, consisting of several stages, the topmost one\r\nrising high above the city wall. Through an opening in the lower story\r\nthere projected the gigantic brazen head of a ram, forming the forepart\r\nof a wooden beam, 120 feet in length, a beam poised upon ropes, and of\r\na weight so great as to require the united strength of two hundred men\r\nto put it in motion. The different stages in the tower were for the use\r\nof archers, whose business it was to clear the enemy from that part\r\nof the wall directly facing the ram. A little turret at the top of the\r\nstructure afforded a coign of vantage for a sentinel to observe and\r\nreport to those below the doings of the besieged.\r\n\r\nThis structure, which was under the charge of Rufus, bore the Greek\r\nname of Nico, or the Conqueror, for although its powers had not yet\r\nbeen tested, it was confidently believed that no wall, however strong,\r\ncould long withstand the repeated shocks of the ram.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this heavy machine was brought within striking distance of\r\nthe wall, two hundred brawny legionaries, grasping a multiplicity of\r\nropes, began slowly to draw the gigantic beam as far back as it would\r\ngo; then, at a given signal, every man simultaneously relinquished his\r\nhold, and the released beam, darting forward with lightning speed, came\r\nwith terrific impact full tilt against the wall.\r\n\r\nAt that mighty stroke the masonry shivered from parapet to foundation.\r\nBut more appalling than the shock itself was the thunder-boom\r\naccompanying it. The sound ran through the length and breadth of the\r\ncity, terrifying Vashti in her distant home on Mount Zion; it was\r\nechoed and re-echoed from all the hills around; it filled the breasts\r\nof even the most stouthearted of the Zealots with fear; while from\r\nevery quarter of Bezetha there came shrieks of terror from women and\r\nchildren, for all who were not near the spot made sure that the wall\r\nhad fallen in, and that the enemy were entering the breach.\r\n\r\nAgain that terrifying boom! and yet again!\r\n\r\nDreadful as was the sound, the agony of waiting for it was even more\r\ndreadful. Some women, unable to bear the strain, stopped their ears\r\nwith their fingers; others fled to cellars and underground places to\r\nescape from the terror.\r\n\r\nThe whole Roman army was now in working order; forty thousand troops\r\narrayed against the northern wall, and not a man idle among them.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrific spectacle, both within and without the city. The\r\ngroaning of the wounded, and the shrieking of the women; the twanging\r\nof the catapults, and the whizzing of darts and arrows; the peculiar\r\nhum of the swift-flying stones slung from the balistæ; the crash of\r\nfalling masonry; the shout of the combatants hurling defiance at each\r\nother; and, above all, the thunder-boom of the brazen rams, as they\r\nsmote against the wall--all contributed to form a scene that transcends\r\nthe power of the pen to describe.\r\n\r\nAll in a moment there was on the part of the Jews a simultaneous\r\ncessation of activity; their archers stopped firing; their engines\r\nceased playing; the whole force stood mute and motionless. A sight so\r\nsurprising caused a temporary suspension of hostilities on the part of\r\nthe Romans, who were wondering whether this Jewish attitude implied the\r\nwish to surrender.\r\n\r\nThe mystery was soon explained.\r\n\r\nFrom the temple--that temple where priests were falling dead or wounded\r\nfrom the stones cast by the engines of the Tenth Legion, stationed upon\r\nMount Olivet, there came the piercing clangor of the silver trumpets.\r\nIt was the time of the morning sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-peal was followed by the lifting of every Jewish sword, and\r\nalong the whole length of the ramparts there rolled one sublime shout,\r\na shout flung in defiance at the polytheism of their opponents, a shout\r\nexpressive of the grandest truth ever proclaimed to mankind:\r\n\r\n  “HEAR, O ISRAEL, THE LORD OUR GOD IS ONE LORD.”\r\n\r\nWith that they flew to the fight with renewed ardor. And now in the\r\noccasional lulls of the fray could be heard a voice, far off at first,\r\nbut drawing gradually nearer, a voice that by the space of eight years\r\nhad never ceased its melancholy ditty:\r\n\r\n“Woe, woe, to Jerusalem!”\r\n\r\nAlong the rampart, winding in and out among the ranks of the fighting\r\nZealots, who received him with black looks and angry murmurs, came the\r\nweird form of Jesus, the son of Hanan, clad, not as was his wont in a\r\ngarment of camel’s hair, but in a long robe of white linen, such as\r\nmight be used to enshroud the dead.\r\n\r\n“A voice from the East, a voice from the West, a voice against\r\nJerusalem and the holy house!”\r\n\r\n“Now, what doeth this madman here, putting fear into the hearts of\r\nbrave men?” muttered Simon, eying the other darkly. But, as Jesus\r\napproached, there was in his looks something so awe-inspiring that\r\nthe Zealot chief, who was minded to do the “madman” hurt, lowered his\r\nweapon and let him pass on.\r\n\r\nThe wild figure, with its lifted arms outlined against the sky, was\r\nplainly visible to the enemy.\r\n\r\nNow, there prevailed in those days the belief that it was possible for\r\na soothsayer to paralyze the efforts of a hostile army by the utterance\r\nof magical spells; and hence, the Romans being too far off to catch his\r\nwords, even if they had been able to understand his Hebrew language,\r\nmistook him for a priest engaged in the task of cursing them.\r\n\r\n“His curses shall fall upon his own pate,” muttered an angry\r\nbalistarius, directing his assistants to slew the head of the machine\r\nround so as to bring its aim to bear athwart the line of the moving\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n“Woe to the city! Woe to the people! Woe to the holy house! _Woe, woe,\r\nto myself also!_”\r\n\r\nScarcely had this last utterance left his mouth when the stone prepared\r\nfrom all eternity for the purpose, smote him so that he fell to rise no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots gazed at the horribly mangled form in fear and awe. This\r\nman, who had prophesied the moment of his own doom, had prophesied\r\nlikewise the doom of the city; since his word was true in the one case,\r\nwhy should it not be true in the other?\r\n\r\nLeave musing for the night; the day is for action, and the Zealots\r\nflew to obey the orders of Simon, who was growing somewhat concerned at\r\nthe shaking of the masonry caused by the strokes of the ram Nico.\r\n\r\nHe directed that gabions or huge sacks stuffed with chaff, should be\r\nlowered in front of the ram in order to weaken the effect of its blows.\r\n\r\nBut the simple device was defeated by one equally simple. Projecting\r\nhorizontally from each side of the tower in which the ram hung were\r\niron mantelets or screens, under cover of which stood a number of\r\nRomans armed with long poles ending in sharp scythes, and with these\r\nthey severed the ropes from which the gabion hung, and when the\r\ndefenders substituted a chain for the rope, the Romans fell upon the\r\ngabion instead, so that through a score of rents the chaff came pouring\r\nout, leaving the gabion to flap emptily against the wall.\r\n\r\n“Why this waste?” said Rufus sarcastically. “They’ll be glad of this\r\nchaff for food before the war be over.”\r\n\r\nA third gabion was lowered. This time a soldier bolder than his\r\nfellows, breaking cover, ran forward, and with a lighted torch fired\r\nthe lower end of the gabion. Instantly there shot upwards a column of\r\nblinding smoke and dazzling flame, whose heat drove the holders of the\r\ngabion backwards; in their confusion they let go the chain, which thus\r\nfell into the hands of the Romans, who punctuated their capture with an\r\nextra loud boom of the ram.\r\n\r\n“No more burnable stuff. Fill the sacks with earth,” said Simon. For\r\na few moments he looked on, watching the destruction of gabion after\r\ngabion. His brow frowning at first began gradually to clear.\r\n\r\n“What will you say, Ananus,” said he, turning to one of his fifty\r\ncaptains, “if I prophesy that within a little space the brazen head of\r\nyon ram shall be hanging over the gate of the temple, an offering to\r\nJehovah?”\r\n\r\n“If Simon says it, ’twill be so,” replied the other, who had unbounded\r\nfaith in his chief.\r\n\r\n“Tie one end of this rope round my waist,” said Simon; “securely--for\r\nhereby hangs my life.”\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\n“Now bring levers.”\r\n\r\nWhen they were brought Simon directed the attention of his followers to\r\na block of masonry which formed part of the battlement that directly\r\noverhung the head of the charging ram.\r\n\r\n“When I lift my hand heave the stone over, and lower me with all speed.”\r\n\r\nLike a watchful lion waiting to swoop upon its quarry stood Simon, his\r\neye upon the ram, which at that moment was being drawn back by four\r\nhundred arms fresh to the task, for the Romans wisely worked in relays\r\nand a new body of men had just been put on.\r\n\r\nThe released beam shot forward, humming through the air.\r\n\r\nSimon gave the signal, and the huge stone was instantly levered over\r\nand fell plump upon the forepart of the ram with such good effect\r\nthat the brazen head snapped clean off amid a mighty splintering of\r\nwoodwork, and lay on the ground beside the fallen stone.\r\n\r\nBut it lay there for a moment only.\r\n\r\nA figure suspended at the end of a rope shot down with lightning\r\nspeed, grasped the great brazen head in both arms, and was drawn up\r\nagain; and, almost before the astonished Romans could realize what had\r\nhappened, there was Simon on the ramparts above triumphantly holding\r\naloft the trophy he had so daringly won.\r\n\r\n“Simon, thou art a lion, and the son of a lion,” said Ananus admiringly.\r\n\r\nA flood of curses broke from the Romans; the ram was useless till the\r\ndamage had been repaired, and as this repairing could be effectively\r\ndone only at a distance from the walls, there remained nothing for it\r\nbut to drag the machine away amid the mocking laughter of the Jews.\r\n\r\nSimon now turned his attention to a terrible danger approaching\r\nthe wall in the shape of a _turris ambulatoria_ or movable tower,\r\nseventy-five feet in height, made of wood, mounted upon wheels, and\r\nprovided with a drawbridge by which when lowered the besiegers hoped to\r\nleap upon the battlements.\r\n\r\nThis great tower was under the charge of Crispus.\r\n\r\nIt would go ill with the Zealots, as Simon well knew, if Crispus and\r\na body of well-disciplined Romans should succeed in establishing\r\nthemselves upon the ramparts.\r\n\r\nProjecting from the rear of the tower, and at a height of about\r\nfour feet from the ground, were six long beams, each provided with\r\ncrossbars; one hundred and twenty men had their shoulders set hard\r\nagainst these crossbars, but in spite of their efforts the rate of\r\nprogression was infinitely slow, owing to the ponderous weight of the\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots made vigorous attempts to set the structure on fire by\r\nmeans of flaming darts; these were wooden shafts, a cubit in length,\r\nthe head being armed with a triangular steel barb to which was affixed\r\na lump of bitumen or other combustible matter; the dart, when set\r\nalight, was hurled with great force into the side of the tower;\r\nwherever it fixed itself in the woodwork little jets of flame spurted\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the tower presented at this moment a scene of\r\nexcitement. At every window of every story were seen soldiers repelling\r\nthe attack, some by discharging javelins at the casters of the fiery\r\ndarts, others by pouring water upon the hissing flames, which as fast\r\nas they died out in one part leaped to life in another.\r\n\r\nCrispus, moving from story to story, directed the operations.\r\n\r\n“Water, here!” he cried, on seeing a dense volume of smoke ascending\r\nfrom one side of the tower.\r\n\r\n“The supply has run out,” replied the decurion in charge of the water\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nHad Crispus not left his pagan days behind him he would have run the\r\nfellow through for his supposed negligence.\r\n\r\n“With six water-carts, and the Serpent’s Pool but a furlong distant,\r\nyou dare to say----?”\r\n\r\n“The Serpent’s Pool hath been so well drawn upon by us and by others\r\nthat it has become exhausted.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! sayest thou so?” exclaimed Crispus, relenting somewhat at this\r\nexplanation. “Well, since water be denied us, hang out the raw hides,”\r\nhe cried, for every tower carried a supply of these to be used as a\r\nprotection against fire. “And bring up sand and earth to drop upon the\r\nflames.”\r\n\r\nBy these means Crispus contrived, not indeed to quench the fire, but to\r\nkeep it somewhat under control.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the giant tower had been pushed to a point sufficiently near\r\nfor the lowering of the drawbridge, the toiling troops, letting go the\r\nbeams, grasped their weapons; and, losing for the moment something of\r\ntheir Roman discipline, scrambled pell-mell into the tower, all eager\r\nto be foremost in the attack, for among the Romans the soldier that\r\nwas first to mount the ramparts of an enemy’s city received--if he\r\nsurvived--the gift of a Mural Crown, a prize that shed a glory over the\r\nrecipient to the end of his days.\r\n\r\nThe way out upon the drawbridge, when it should be lowered, led\r\nfrom the fifth story; it was into this chamber, therefore, that the\r\nstorming-party was now crowding. The drawbridge, standing bolt upright\r\nbefore the doorway, acted as a screen, but when it fell they would be\r\nfacing a storm of arrows and javelins. It was almost certain death to\r\nthe men who should be foremost to run out upon the drawbridge; yet,\r\ndespite the peril, each soldier was striving with his fellow for the\r\nhonor of being second, the first place being claimed by Crispus himself.\r\n\r\n“A Cestius lost the city; a Cestius shall recover it,” said he. “Stand\r\nby me,” he continued, addressing the aquilifer, “we’ll plant the eagle\r\non the ramparts, or die in the attempt.”\r\n\r\nFor the eagle, though no longer an object of worship with Crispus, was\r\nstill sacred in his eyes as the emblem of a glorious empire.\r\n\r\nIt was a thrilling moment. As they stood there in a mass so dense that\r\neach could scarce lift his arms, they could hear the never-ceasing\r\nthud-thud of the fiery darts falling upon the outer walls.\r\n\r\nAt each side of the doorway, awaiting the signal to lower, stood\r\ntwo brawny legionaries, their hands upon the ropes that worked the\r\ndrawbridge.\r\n\r\n“All ready, men?” said Crispus, with a glance at the set faces behind\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe question met with an eager response.\r\n\r\n“Guard your faces well. Now!”\r\n\r\nUp went the ropes, and as they swirled fast over the creaking pulleys,\r\nthe upper end of the drawbridge falling away from the tower began a\r\nrapid descent upon the city wall.\r\n\r\nThe sight was seen from near and from far, and both armies set up a\r\nsimultaneous roar, the one in dismay, the other in exultation, a roar\r\nso tremendous as to drown even the thunder-boom of the battering-rams.\r\n\r\nTitus, who knew that Crispus was in charge of this tower, slapped his\r\nthigh with a fierce joy.\r\n\r\n“By the gods, Crispus hath opened a way into the city!” he cried.\r\n\r\nThousands on both sides paused in the fray to watch the contest upon\r\nthe drawbridge. Of what use was it to continue the fight elsewhere, if\r\nonce this part of the wall should be seized and held by Crispus and his\r\nband?\r\n\r\nThe fate of Bezetha at least, if not of all Jerusalem, hung upon the\r\nissue of the next few moments.\r\n\r\nAs the drawbridge fell with a mighty thud upon the ramparts, Crispus,\r\nsword in hand, and with buckler held before his face, leaped out upon\r\nthe shivering timbers, followed by a crowd of warriors.\r\n\r\nThe sequel was appalling!\r\n\r\nThey found themselves amid a blinding, whirling hurricane of arrows and\r\ndarts, javelins and stones, coming from the front, from the left, from\r\nthe right. Obedient to Simon’s orders every Jewish marksman, far and\r\nnear, from turret, battlement and loophole, shot thick and fast at the\r\ndevoted band upon the drawbridge. In such numbers and with such fury\r\ndid the missiles smite upon helmet and breastplate, shield and greave,\r\nthat the little band were absolutely unable to advance; they staggered\r\nto and fro as though struck by lightning; they fell, dead and dying\r\nfrom the bridge.\r\n\r\nCrispus, preserved from death by the superior temper of his armor,\r\ntook several wounds, nevertheless; three arrows were quivering in\r\nhis sword-arm; two hung from the calf of his leg, though the fierce\r\nexcitement of the moment prevented him from feeling them.\r\n\r\nFor one bewildering moment he stood irresolute; then, gathering himself\r\nup for a mighty effort, he darted forward all alone across the bridge.\r\nTwenty missiles striking him at one and the same time, caused him to\r\nreel like a drunken man.\r\n\r\nThen came the end!\r\n\r\nSimon had not seen the advance of the ambulatory tower without making\r\ndue preparation for its reception.\r\n\r\nThe moment the drawbridge touched the battlement there sprang up\r\nbefore it four of his strongest captains, each armed with a mighty\r\nax; and, while Simon with the keen edge of his scimitar severed the\r\nropes by which the drawbridge had been lowered, his four captains\r\nplied their axes with such good effect that ere the Romans could come\r\nrushing across to prevent it, the whole bridge, cut clean off from\r\nthe battlement, swung downwards, and its living freight were hurled\r\nprecipitately through forty feet of air to the rocky ground below,\r\nwhere they lay a struggling, helpless mound of heads, arms, and legs,\r\nwhich in the next moment bristled all over with arrows shot at them by\r\nthe delighted Jewish archers.\r\n\r\n“Bring on your next tower,” cried Simon mockingly, “and we’ll deal with\r\nit in like fashion.”\r\n\r\nAmong the few who contrived to limp painfully away to a place beyond\r\nreach of the enemy’s fire was Crispus, bruised, dizzy, white-faced,\r\nwith a dozen arrowheads embedded in his flesh.\r\n\r\nSitting down, he proceeded to extract these barbs, and, the means being\r\nat hand, he anointed his wounds and bound them with linen swathings, in\r\nwhich task he was engaged when Titus came up.\r\n\r\n“Now, the gods be praised, you live. But you are wounded; there must\r\nbe no more fighting for you to-day. Hither, two of you! Lay the noble\r\nCrispus upon a buckler, and carry him back to camp.”\r\n\r\nBut Crispus vowed he was not so hurt as to necessitate his immediate\r\nremoval.\r\n\r\n“Mere flesh-wounds, though I confess I am somewhat dazed by my fall.\r\nLet me rest for an hour in this cool shade, and I’ll be ready for the\r\nfray again.”\r\n\r\n“Well, as thou wilt. Farewell awhile. I am beginning to like this\r\nSimon; he is a foe worth fighting.”\r\n\r\nSimon’s admirable tactics seemed to have a discouraging effect upon the\r\nlegionaries. At any rate the attack began to languish. The noontide sun\r\nwas now streaming directly upon the faces of the Romans, dazzling the\r\neyes of the archers and slingers, and marring the accuracy of their\r\naim. The heat of the day, the clouds of dust, the toil of war had\r\nproduced among the besiegers the agony of a raging thirst, a thirst\r\nwhich they had no means of quenching. The _posca_--the water, sharpened\r\nwith vinegar--which every soldier was wont to carry with him in a\r\nleathern bottle, had long since been drained to the last drop, and no\r\nfurther supply was at hand.\r\n\r\nCrispus, still faint and dazed, reclined against the agger.\r\n\r\n“O, for water!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“There is none in all the host,” remarked a soldier standing by. “Men\r\nare offering a gold piece for a cup of water.”\r\n\r\n“And the enemy have become aware of our want,” said a second soldier.\r\n“See! they are holding up vessels of water, and wastefully spilling it\r\nin mockery at our distress.”\r\n\r\nTitus with a troubled face came up at that moment.\r\n\r\n“We are in rueful strait,” said he. “Our men are fainting for lack\r\nof water. The Serpent’s Pool is exhausted; Cedron hath run dry. Our\r\nengineers cannot sink a well, the rocky ground forbidding it. Where are\r\nwe to look for water?”\r\n\r\n“There is a pool called Siloam, on the south side of the city,” replied\r\nCrispus. “It may not be dry.”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” exclaimed Titus, with new hope. “But,” he added doubtfully,\r\n“whoever goes thither must pass under the eastern wall exposed to the\r\nfire of the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“But is not the Tenth Legion stationed on Olivet ready to repel any\r\nsortie from that quarter? Give me the water-carts and a convoy of two\r\nhundred horsemen, and I’ll engage to return with water enough for the\r\nwhole host.”\r\n\r\n“Take three hundred, and good fortune go with you.”\r\n\r\nEre many minutes were past there went clattering down the Vale of\r\nCedron a long train of wagons, whose drivers were escorted by a\r\ndetachment of mounted soldiers, three hundred strong.\r\n\r\nHigh above their heads hummed and whizzed volleys of stones and darts\r\nslung from Olivet by the balistæ and catapults of the Tenth Legion,\r\nwho sought in this way to protect the movements of the water-seekers.\r\n\r\nLooking forth from the eastern wall, John of Giscala and his Zealots\r\ncaught sight of the Roman horsemen, and vainly tried to stay their\r\nprogress by flights of arrows.\r\n\r\nOn dashed the convoy, past the olive grove of Gethsemane, and now they\r\nwere in the deepest part of the Black Glen; far above them on their\r\nright was the temple, towering aloft in the sunlight to the height of\r\nnearly five hundred feet; on, past the wall of Ophel, and, rounding its\r\nsouthern end, they swung westward. Here, where the glen of Tyropæon\r\nopens out into the Vale of Cedron, was a picturesque spot known from of\r\nold as the King’s Garden, and watered by a streamlet from Siloam.\r\n\r\nTo his great joy, Crispus found that the Pool of Siloam--a long,\r\nrectangular basin, excavated in the solid rock for the reception of the\r\noutflow of a spring--was full of cool, limpid water.\r\n\r\nBy a coincidence, too timely to be regarded as fortuitous, Siloam,\r\nwhose waters had been “sealed” for nearly four years, _had started\r\nflowing again upon the coming of the Roman army_![26] To the Jews the\r\nMessianic fountain seemed to be playing the part of a traitor. The\r\nwater, so long withheld from them, was now flowing for the enemy. What\r\ndid it mean? they darkly asked, failing to see in this acted parable\r\nthat the Divine kingdom was being taken from them and given to the\r\nGentiles.\r\n\r\nThe thirsting Roman band, springing from their steeds, first refreshed\r\nthemselves, and proceeded next with all speed to the filling of the\r\nwater-carts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jews, who were looking on from the wall of Ophel, realized the\r\nobject of this sudden dash on the part of the Romans, they gave vent to\r\nindignant and wrathful cries.\r\n\r\nWhat? Must the unclean and uncircumcized heathen be permitted to carry\r\naway for his profane use the water used in the sacred rites of the\r\ntemple? In the name of Elohim--no!\r\n\r\nWide clanged the Fountain Gate, and out poured a tumultuous crowd of\r\nfierce-shouting saber-brandishing Zealots, led on by John of Giscala.\r\n\r\n“To horse!” sang out the Roman trumpet; and instantly the troops\r\nmounted and swung into line. Crispus’ question, “Shall we give them\r\nbattle?” met with an eager affirmative. Not a man among them but\r\nthrilled with joy at the prospect of a hand-to-hand engagement with the\r\nenemy. For many hours they had been waging an unsatisfactory warfare\r\nagainst flying missiles, but here was something more substantial,\r\nsomething they could flesh their steel upon!\r\n\r\nWith the spirit of his fighting ancestors dancing in his veins, Crispus\r\ncried, “Why wait we here? We’ll go to meet them. _Charge!_”\r\n\r\nHe put his steed to the gallop, and the whole three hundred, knee to\r\nknee and sword in air, went racing after him up the valley of Tyropæon.\r\n\r\nFaster and faster they whirled towards the foe, gathering momentum with\r\nevery yard. The thundering hoofs and flashing steel made a sight so\r\nnerveshaking that the crowd of onrushing Zealots came to a dead halt.\r\n\r\n“Stand fast!” yelled John to his followers.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was hurled to the earth, as the head of the Roman\r\ncolumn went crashing with irresistible force into the midst of the\r\nZealots.\r\n\r\nThe contest was short and sharp. John’s men lacked the fire of Simon’s;\r\nfor a moment only they fought, then turned tail and fled; and the\r\ndelighted Romans chased and slew up to the very gate of the city, all\r\nbut entering with the foe.\r\n\r\n“John of Giscala hath escaped us,” growled a centurion, as he turned\r\naway from the gate at which he had been savagely kicking.\r\n\r\n“He is reserved for another day,” answered Crispus.\r\n\r\nLaughing over their easy victory the little band galloped back to their\r\nwater-carts, and, as they clattered again up the valley of the Cedron,\r\nthey cast gibes at the discomfited Zealots upon the wall.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the water the thirsting Roman army imbibed fresh\r\nenergy, but though they toiled hard till nightfall they failed to open\r\na way into the city.\r\n\r\nThus ended the first day’s fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                            CIRCUMVALLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth day of the siege the repaired ram Nico, or the\r\nConqueror, justified its name by effecting a breach in the northern\r\nwall; and Simon, seeing his position no longer tenable, fell back upon\r\nhis second line of defense.\r\n\r\nThis was the first great step in the siege.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, entering Bezetha on the fifteenth day, proceeded to\r\ndemolish the greater part of this suburb, the demolition being\r\nnecessary in order to clear the way for the advance of the\r\nbattering-train.\r\n\r\nNine days more, and the Romans had penetrated the second wall, and were\r\nnow masters of the suburb of Acra, which they proceeded to treat in\r\nlike fashion with that of Bezetha.\r\n\r\nThis was the second great step in the siege.\r\n\r\n“Bezetha taken in fifteen days, Acra in nine,” exulted Titus. “We are\r\ngetting on.”\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander, to whom the remark was addressed, shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“Mere outworks, Cæsar. What we have done is child’s play compared with\r\nwhat remains to be done.”\r\n\r\nTitus began to be of the same opinion as he stood amid the fast\r\ndismantling Acra, and surveyed a long chain of defiant fortresses.\r\n\r\nBefore him as he looked southwards rose the rugged escarpment of Mount\r\nZion, forty feet high, its edge surmounted by a lofty wall, whose\r\ncircuit included those magnificent towers, Hippicus, Phasaelus, and\r\nMariamne, each a citadel in itself. Above him, on his left hand,\r\nsoared the temple-fortress, and adjacent to it the Turris Antonia, this\r\nlast standing on a rock, which rock was not only seventy-five feet\r\nhigh, but had its perpendicular sides cased with smooth marble!\r\n\r\nAfter deliberating with his staff Titus resolved to make a simultaneous\r\nattack on Mount Zion and on Antonia.\r\n\r\nBut how to reach these strongholds elevated in mid-air?\r\n\r\nThere was but one way, by the raising of banks--a stupendous operation!\r\nBut the Romans were familiarized with such tasks, and, animated by the\r\nsame resolute spirit as their general, they set to work with a fiery\r\nenergy that nothing could daunt. Owing to the scarcity of earth, timber\r\nand fascines were largely used in the erection of these works, to such\r\nan extent indeed, that not a tree remained within sight of Jerusalem.\r\nThe sylvan beauty of the landscape vanished; the Jewish people, looking\r\nfar and wide from the city walls, could see around them nothing but a\r\ntreeless and desolate waste. On the seventeenth day a huge embankment\r\nfaced the northern side of Antonia, but just when the engines planted\r\nupon it were beginning to play, the Romans, to their consternation and\r\ndismay, found the whole mound slowly beginning to sink. As the rate of\r\nsubsidence varied in different parts, chasms began to yawn, the rams\r\nand towers rolled this way and that, crashing into each other with\r\ndestructive effect; men found themselves entangled among the machines,\r\noverwhelmed with earth, suffocated with dust; a prodigious quantity\r\nof smoke burst forth from the embankment, followed by darting tongues\r\nof flame. It was death to remain longer upon it, and the amazed and\r\naffrighted Romans, running in all directions, leaped from the mound.\r\n\r\nThe cause of it all soon became clear. John of Giscala and his Zealot\r\ncrew, toiling underground with an energy almost superhuman, had\r\ndriven a vast mine beneath the Roman agger, a mine whose roof and\r\nsupports were formed of timber, daubed with bitumen, sulphur, and other\r\ncombustibles. The ignition of these supports caused the engulfing of\r\nthe bank, and the complete destruction of the engines.\r\n\r\n“Seest thou what John hath wrought?” cried Simon to his followers.\r\n“Shall we be outdone by him?”\r\n\r\nNow a similar bank was facing Zion, and two days later, at eventide,\r\njust when the Romans had retired to their camp, leaving the customary\r\nforce to guard this bank, the gates of Zion opened, and from each\r\nissued a crowd of Zealots, every one carrying either a lighted torch or\r\na vessel flaming with combustibles, and every one under a _cherem_ or\r\ncurse, not to return till he had seen the Roman engines and the Roman\r\nbank in a blaze.\r\n\r\nComing forth, not by hundreds, but by thousands, they poured down\r\nthe craggy descent like a flood, wave upon wave, and swept up to the\r\nembankment; some, fighting like fiends, impaled themselves upon the\r\npoints of the Roman spears, and so died; others, equally brave but more\r\nfortunate, broke through the guard, scaled the embankment, and, running\r\nhither and thither, set the engines alight, and finished the work of\r\ndestruction by firing the embankment itself, so that by the time Titus\r\nand the rest of the army came up, the huge platform of earth and timber\r\nwas a roaring sea of unquenchable flame!\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time during the siege, the spirit of despair fell\r\nupon Titus. He began to think with the murmuring and superstitious\r\nlegionaries that the fiery comet which, in the shape of a sword, shed a\r\nred gleam nightly over Jerusalem, was directing its malignant influence\r\nnot against the Jews but against the Romans.\r\n\r\nHis mood was shown by the letter directed jointly to his father\r\nVespasian and the Roman Senate; the dispatch omitted the customary\r\nformula: “I rejoice if all is well with you and your children; with\r\nmyself and the army all is well.”\r\n\r\nAll was _not_ well with him and the army. The tactics of Simon and John\r\nhad caused the entire disappearance of his battering-train.\r\n\r\nWas there no other course left him than to order the Greek engineers\r\nof Cæsarea to construct a new set of military machines, an order that\r\nwould require several weeks for its fulfillment?\r\n\r\nMany and various were the suggestions put forth at the council held in\r\nthe tent of Titus.\r\n\r\nThe plan of massing the whole strength of the legions against a\r\nselected part of the wall, and of continuing the assault night and day\r\nwith testudo and scaling-ladder, regardless of the loss of life, till\r\nthe place should be finally stormed, was rejected as impracticable,\r\nas was also the proposition to tunnel a way through the rock into the\r\nheart of the city.\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander rose to speak.\r\n\r\n“By all means send to Cæsarea for new engines,” said he. “In the\r\nmeantime we’ll turn the siege into a blockade, and make famine our\r\nchief weapon. Food within the city is already running short, even among\r\nthe Zealots themselves, so much so that, if the stories of deserters\r\nbe true, these same Zealots are robbing the people of their bread, and\r\ntorturing those whom they suspect of concealing it.\r\n\r\n“But if the city is to be effectually starved, we must close up every\r\navenue of access. Now, hitherto, we have kept but an ill watch upon the\r\nwestern and southern sides of the city, with the result that certain\r\nmerchants, despising the Roman power, and eager to coin wealth out of\r\nJewish necessities, are in the habit of stealing nightly to the city to\r\nsupply its wants. Tyrians bring fish, and Egyptians corn; Arabs purvey\r\ndates, and the Nabatæans supplies of bitumen from the Dead Sea, that\r\nfiery bitumen whose effects we know so well. Unless these doings be\r\nstopped, the siege will be prolonged indefinitely. Now, my counsel is\r\nthat we encircle the city with a wall to be patrolled night and day; so\r\nshall we cut off the enemy from all outside help.\r\n\r\n“And since the more mouths there are in the city the more quickly will\r\nfood vanish, do you, O Cæsar, who have hitherto dealt kindly with\r\ndeserters, make it known that henceforth crucifixion shall be the lot\r\nof those who come to us for pity.\r\n\r\n“In six weeks’ time they will be eating each other, and victory will be\r\nours; for we shall be contending, not with strong men, but with gaunt\r\nand famished weaklings, scarce able to lift spear or shield.\r\n\r\n“Fasting is a part of their religion,” this renegade Hebrew concluded,\r\nwith a sneer. “Let them be made to keep such a fast as they never\r\nbefore kept in all their history.”\r\n\r\nThe counsel of Tiberius Alexander prevailed, as Crispus knew that it\r\nwould prevail, even before the prefect had made an end of speaking.\r\nVain was it for others to propose a different plan, when, forty years\r\npreviously, a Divine voice had said: “_Thine enemies shall cast a\r\ntrench about thee, and compass thee around, and keep thee in on every\r\nside._”\r\n\r\nThe next day witnessed the beginning of the fatal circuit.\r\n\r\nAround the doomed city was drawn, over high hill and down deep ravine,\r\na double wall; one, the contravallation, designed to repel sorties from\r\nthe city; the other, the circumvallation, to repel attacks coming from\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nEach of these investing lines was defended on its outer side by a\r\ndeep trench, and at every third furlong rose a castellum or fort, the\r\nstation of a garrison.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the army, 50,000 strong, was employed upon the work, which\r\nwas completed at the end of three days; a marvelously quick feat, even\r\nfor Romans, accustomed, as they were, to trenching and embanking.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots affected to view these operations with unconcern, casting\r\ngibes at Titus, whenever he came within earshot.\r\n\r\nSome of these gibes had reference to Berenice, who was known to be the\r\nobject of his adoration.\r\n\r\n“The fair one at Cæsarea is lonely,” they cried. “The daughter of\r\nAgrippa looketh out at a window, and crieth through the lattice, ‘Why\r\nis his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariot?’”\r\n\r\nOther gibes were directed at Titus’ plebeian origin.\r\n\r\n“Thy father was once a horse-doctor,” cried one. “Why not return to the\r\nold trade, Titus? for plainly thou art no warrior. Depart, seeing that\r\nthou canst not take this city.”\r\n\r\nAt this, Terentius Rufus, growing fierce for the honor of Cæsar, lifted\r\nup a plow that by chance was lying near, and swore a memorable oath.\r\n\r\n“Hear now the vow I make, O ye rebels! With this will I plow Zion as\r\none ploweth a field!”\r\n\r\nA flight of arrows caused him to retreat, but he kept to his plow.\r\n\r\n“Take this to my tent,” said he to a soldier, “and there let it be till\r\nthe day when I call for it. Terentius Rufus will keep his word.”\r\n\r\nOn the first night after the completion of the investing lines Titus\r\nhimself, accompanied by Crispus, went the round of the watch. Often\r\ndid the eyes of Crispus turn towards the city, now sleeping peacefully\r\nbeneath the light of the stars. The reduction of the place by famine\r\nwas doubtless justifiable from a military point of view, but he could\r\nnot help thinking of the fearful anguish that would fill ten thousand\r\nhomes; above all, he thought of Vashti. He pictured her, tormented by\r\nall the agonies of slow starvation, dying by inches, her sweet and\r\ngraceful beauty all gone, a hollow-eyed thing of skin and bone, with\r\nbrain crazed for the lack of food, and he scarcely a mile distant with\r\nbread and to spare, yet unable to pass her so little as a crust.\r\n\r\nWhen the city should be taken, would she be living or dead? It was a\r\npoint which, strangely enough, had not occurred to him before that, if\r\nliving, she would be, according to the rights of war as practiced in a\r\nbrutal age, a captive doomed to slavery. He resolved there and then to\r\nclaim her freedom from the only man capable of granting it.\r\n\r\n“When you take the city, Cæsar, there is one whose life and freedom I\r\nwould fain crave.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis granted, provided that the object of your request be not a\r\ndescendant of David.”\r\n\r\n“Why that exception?” asked Crispus in great surprise.\r\n\r\n“The orders of my sire Vespasian are that I am to make search for all\r\nthat are of David’s line with a view to their extirpation.[27] The Jew\r\nis convinced that a descendant of this ancient royal house is destined\r\nto attain universal empire, a belief which has given rise to this\r\npresent revolt; therefore, destroy all that are of David’s line, and\r\nyou extinguish this vain Jewish dream.”\r\n\r\nHow Crispus rejoiced in the thought that the saintly bishop Simeon, and\r\nthe remaining Desposyni--relatives of the Master--were at that moment\r\nin distant Pella!\r\n\r\n“She for whom I would make request,” said he, “is one Vashti, daughter\r\nof Hyrcanus.”\r\n\r\nTitus gave a start of surprise.\r\n\r\n“She to whom you gave the golden zone at Cæsarea?”\r\n\r\n“The same,” replied Crispus, conjecturing that Titus’ knowledge of this\r\nincident was derived from Berenice.\r\n\r\n“What is this maiden to you?” asked Titus with a keen glance.\r\n\r\n“Much, seeing that but for her I should no longer be living,” replied\r\nCrispus, relating the circumstances of his recovery from Eleazar’s\r\nsword-thrust.\r\n\r\nTitus seemed genuinely troubled. Crispus had distinguished himself so\r\nwell in the siege that it was hard to refuse him this favor.\r\n\r\n“Gladly would I grant your request, but that it comes too late. The\r\nPrincess Berenice is desirous of obtaining possession of that damsel.”\r\n\r\nCrispus at that moment looked more dazed than when he fell from the\r\ndrawbridge.\r\n\r\n“Berenice!” he murmured. “What would _she_ with Vashti?”\r\n\r\n“The princess likes to have pretty and graceful maidens about her. She\r\nmade me promise that out of the spoils of the city I would give her\r\nthis Vashti.”\r\n\r\n“And you will?”\r\n\r\nTitus shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“She was not content with an oral promise. She holds a parchment signed\r\nby my hand empowering her to claim Vashti as her slave.”\r\n\r\nIn Crispus’ opinion it would be better, far better, for Vashti to die\r\nof slow starvation than to fall into the hands of the jealous Berenice,\r\nwhose only object in this enslavement was to gratify her spirit of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nHe said no more, knowing the uselessness of interceding, but he had\r\nquite made up his mind what he would do; and he could do it, too, in\r\nall good conscience.\r\n\r\n“Let Cæsar’s parchment bond say what it will,” said he within himself.\r\n“I will save Vashti from the doom intended for her, though it cost me\r\nmy life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                             THE DYING CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gaunt specter of famine was stalking through Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nOn the very first day of the siege the price of food had mounted so\r\nhigh that a bushel of wheat could not be had for less than a talent\r\nof gold,[28] but as soon as the Roman wall had cut off the Jews from\r\nall external supplies ten times ten talents could not purchase even a\r\nhandful of grain.\r\n\r\nThen from ten thousand homes there rose up the cry for bread; but the\r\nheaven above was as brass; the God that had shed down manna upon their\r\nforefathers remained cold to all the wild wailings in the synagogues.\r\n\r\nHe who had laid up food for himself was not certain of benefiting by\r\nhis forethought, for the Zealots broke into whatsoever house they\r\npleased, and upon those suspected of concealing food they inflicted\r\ntorments so horrible as to seem rather the invention of fiends than of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAmong those hitherto preserved from the visits of the Zealots, though\r\nliving in daily dread of such visits, were Vashti and her mother.\r\n\r\nThe two dwelt all alone, since Miriam, in expectation of famine, had\r\ndismissed her handmaids at the beginning of the siege.\r\n\r\nVashti had never known a more unhappy time than the present, and\r\nshe had begun to doubt whether it would not have been wiser to have\r\nfollowed the counsel of the holy Simeon by escaping while it was\r\npossible from the doomed city.\r\n\r\nIt was not the gnawing pangs of hunger that distressed her so much as\r\nthe knowledge that she had altogether lost her mother’s love. Miriam\r\ntreated her with an unkindliness that seemed to increase with each\r\nsucceeding day. She was forever reproaching Vashti as being a Christian\r\nand a lover of the Romans.\r\n\r\n“But I love you, too, dear mother, more than all the Christians, or\r\nwould I have remained here with you, when I might have retired safely\r\nto Pella?”\r\n\r\nHer mother took no notice of this pertinent argument, but began to\r\ninveigh against Crispus, whose conspicuous valor during the siege had\r\ninspired the Jews with a hatred almost equal to that felt for Titus\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Why did you nurse him back to life? He is a serpent repaying our\r\nkindness by doing all the hurt he can to the holy city.”\r\n\r\nNot wishing to vex her mother, Vashti refrained from argument, and went\r\nwith aching heart to survey their fast diminishing store of provisions.\r\nThe slender stock of meal, figs, and dried grapes would last but a few\r\ndays more, and then----?\r\n\r\nThe two women contented themselves with a few mouthfuls a day in order\r\nthat little Arad might have sufficient for his wants. He was now\r\nbetween five and six years of age, and was idolized at least by his\r\nsister, if not by his mother. The child could not help observing how\r\nlittle they ate.\r\n\r\n“It is all through the Romans,” answered his mother fiercely, adding,\r\n“say, ‘God curse the Romans!’”\r\n\r\nThe little fellow repeated the words.\r\n\r\n“Now you say it, Vashti,” said he.\r\n\r\nBut Vashti, believing that the Romans were God’s ministers, tearfully\r\nshook her head, and this produced a fresh outburst of wrath on the\r\npart of Miriam, who seemed to take an unholy pleasure in setting the\r\nchild against Vashti, saying so many bitter things that Vashti withdrew\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nAt last came the time of starvation.\r\n\r\nFor two days the women fasted, giving to Arad what remained of their\r\nstore; and, as Miriam watched him eating, there was in her eyes a look\r\nthat Vashti did not like to see, a look as if she were begrudging the\r\nchild its food.\r\n\r\nOn the third day he, too, had to fast.\r\n\r\nHis pitiful questionings and sobbings gave additional pangs to Vashti’s\r\nown anguish. But where was she to look for relief? To solicit food from\r\nher friends and neighbors would but provoke them to mocking laughter,\r\nif indeed the power to laugh remained in them. If they had food, would\r\nthey part with it, when such act would be but to hasten their own end?\r\nWhat was Arad to them? they would say. Had they not dying children of\r\ntheir own? Why prolong Arad’s sufferings? The quicker death came to him\r\nthe better. Such were the answers Vashti would receive, as she very\r\nwell knew.\r\n\r\nAs for Miriam, she had grown neglectful of the boy; faint and\r\ndizzy, she restlessly tottered with feeble step from room to room,\r\nlooking into every corner, probing behind every piece of furniture,\r\nemptying every chest of its contents, in the hope of lighting upon\r\nsomething--anything--that could satisfy for a time the gnawing pangs of\r\nhunger. But vain was her search.\r\n\r\nThe two women passed the third night foodless. Arad cried himself to\r\nsleep. Vashti spent the dark hours in a state between slumbering and\r\nwaking; when she dreamed, it was of delicious banquets, from which with\r\na sudden start she would wake to the dreadful realities of her position.\r\n\r\nAnd now dawned the fourth day of her fast, and Arad, waking again, set\r\nup his piteous cry for food, a cry that went to the heart of Vashti.\r\nMust she sit idly by, and watch the child die?\r\n\r\nA sudden thought set all her nerves thrilling with joy. Looking around\r\nand finding her mother absent, she knelt beside his pallet, and\r\nwhispered to him, “Don’t cry, Arad. Lie still, and be good, and I’ll\r\nbring you something to eat.”\r\n\r\nPacified somewhat by this announcement the little fellow became quiet.\r\n\r\nOn passing into the next chamber Vashti saw her mother crouching in a\r\ncorner upon the floor, her head bowed down upon her knees. She seemed,\r\nas if having once sat down, to lack all power to rise again. As Vashti\r\ndrew near, Miriam feebly raised her head, and stared in moody and\r\ndull despair at her daughter. She made no inquiries as to Arad; not a\r\nword passed her lips; she had reached the stage when speaking becomes\r\npainful and irritating, the stage when all interest in outward things\r\nceases, the stage where one sits on the ground silently brooding,\r\nwaiting for the slow approach of death.\r\n\r\nVashti’s youthful frame contained more life and energy than her\r\nmother’s, but soon she, too, unable to drag her limbs along, must sit,\r\nbrooding, silent, dying.\r\n\r\nVashti said nothing to her mother. What could she say? Cheering words\r\nwould be but a mockery.\r\n\r\nShe climbed the stairway, and passed out upon the roof.\r\n\r\nA few weeks previously Arad had taken there a large cake of bread with\r\na view of amusing himself by tossing crumbs up into the air in order to\r\nattract the attention of pigeons and sparrows. For some reason or other\r\nhe had not carried out his purpose, and the bread instead of being\r\ncarried down again was placed by him within a hollow under a tile to\r\nbe reserved for the sport of some other day. That day had never come,\r\nhowever; and there it had lain forgotten by Vashti till this moment.\r\nWas it still there? she wondered. Yes, there it was, large enough to\r\nserve little Arad for one meal. A great temptation came upon Vashti\r\nto fix her teeth into it there and then, and gnaw away till nothing\r\nremained; but the thought of Arad controlled this selfish prompting.\r\n\r\nThe bread was as hard as iron, but a little soaking in water would soon\r\nrender it soft and palatable.\r\n\r\nConcealing the precious fragment within her bosom, Vashti descended the\r\nstairway, passing by her mother again, who looked at her with the same\r\nlistless, mechanical stare as before. Under that dreadful look Vashti\r\nfelt like a traitress. A struggle began in her breast. Was it right to\r\nconceal this discovery from her mother? Was she not entitled to a share\r\nof the crust? Yes, if she would be content with a share, but supposing\r\nin her fierce hunger she should seize upon the whole? _There_ was\r\nVashti’s fear. Affection bade her choose between her mother and Arad,\r\nand the latter prevailed. It went to her heart to leave her mother\r\ndying there, but it would go to her heart still more to see little Arad\r\nrobbed of his last morsel by the mother who bore him.\r\n\r\nAs Vashti entered the chamber the little fellow turned his eyes eagerly\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nShe stole to his pallet.\r\n\r\n“See! here is a large cake of bread; but it is hard, and must be\r\nsoftened before you can eat it.” And then, dreading lest her mother’s\r\nears should be caught by these doings, she added in a whisper, “Hush!\r\ndo not talk, darling. Lie still, and you shall have it soon.”\r\n\r\nHaving rendered the bread eatable by moistening it with water,\r\ntormented the while by a fearful longing to devour it herself, she\r\nhanded the whole to Arad.\r\n\r\nThere were many fathers among the besieging Romans outside, men of\r\nhumane disposition, despite their warlike calling. Could they have\r\nwitnessed the joy with which the little fellow swallowed the not very\r\npalatable morsels, they would surely have loaded their balistæ, not\r\nwith stones, but with loaves, and have rained them upon the roof of\r\nMiriam’s dwelling.\r\n\r\n“Eat slowly,” said Vashti, “or ’twill do you hurt.”\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely said this when a scream broke from her. Between her\r\nand Arad there had suddenly dropped a skinny hand, a hand that clutched\r\ngreedily at the bread, a hand belonging to the figure whom Vashti had\r\nthought to be still crouching upon the floor of the next apartment.\r\n\r\nArad, instinctively divining that he was about to be robbed of his\r\nmeal, crammed one end of the crust into his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Give it to me,” shrieked Miriam, tugging at the other end with such\r\nforce as to drag the child from off his pallet.\r\n\r\nArad hung with his teeth upon the crust; it suddenly parted, and\r\nMiriam, securing her own piece, swallowed it with a wolfish gusto\r\ndreadful to witness, while Vashti looked on in fear and trembling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, mother! mother!” she gasped. “How could you do it?”\r\n\r\nArad, frightened almost to death by his mother’s deed and look, clung\r\nto his sister, who strove to soothe his grief.\r\n\r\n“It is as I have suspected,” said Miriam. “You are hiding food from me\r\nto satisfy yourself and Arad, while I, your mother, may starve.”\r\n\r\n“Not so, mother.”\r\n\r\n“Will you deny what mine eyes have seen? Show me the way to your secret\r\nstore.”\r\n\r\n“I have no secret store.”\r\n\r\n“Whence, then, did you obtain this bread?”\r\n\r\nVashti explained, but all to no purpose. Miriam persisted in declaring\r\nthat Vashti had secreted provisions somewhere in the house, and\r\nannounced her intention of watching henceforth all her daughter’s\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nVashti, weak before, was now almost ready to collapse under the shock\r\nof this rude encounter, but for Arad’s sake she bravely bore up.\r\n\r\nHer indignation against her mother passed away after a time, giving\r\nplace to pity; in taking Arad’s food Miriam had been doing only what\r\nshe herself had been terribly tempted to do. Though tormented within\r\nby a gnawing pain that grew greater with each hour, Vashti, hiding it\r\nall under a cheerful mien, sought to make Arad forget his sorrows;\r\nshe brought out his toys (for children had toys in those days as in\r\nthese) and played with him; she procured parchment, ink and pens, and\r\ndrew letters and objects and little pictures for his diversion; she\r\ntold him simple stories and sang some of the psalms known to him that\r\nhe might chime in with his little voice. Those psalms recalled the\r\nhappy twilight hours spent with Crispus, and she sang with a quaver\r\nin her voice and tears welling from her eyes, till at last she broke\r\ndown entirely and sobbed aloud. Seeing his sister cry, Arad naturally\r\ncried, too; and, the pangs of hunger asserting themselves, he began his\r\npiteous wail for something to eat.\r\n\r\n“Give us of your store,” said Miriam.\r\n\r\n“Mother, I have no store.”\r\n\r\n“Then, find us food,” returned Miriam, raising her voice to a shriek.\r\n“You see me and the child starving, and yet you sit idly by doing\r\nnothing to prevent it. Are we to die? I am too weak to stir abroad,\r\nbut you have strength left. There must be food somewhere in the\r\ncity. Go and find it. Take money, your jewels, your golden zone.\r\nBuy--beg--steal, if need be, but bring us food.”\r\n\r\nIn Vashti’s opinion Miriam’s words were mere raving. Of what use was\r\nit to wander through the city offering to buy food from a starving\r\npopulace? He who had bread, would he not keep it?\r\n\r\nSuddenly she bethought herself of one with whom she had always been a\r\nfavorite, the benevolent Johanan ben Zacchai, whose two daughters had\r\nbeen her lifelong friends.\r\n\r\nShe would go to their home in Ophel, and, if they should be the happy\r\npossessors of food, beg a little of it for the sake of Arad. Kissing\r\nhim passionately she laid him down, and went forth on this dubious\r\nerrand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe setting sun was tingeing with a golden glow the higher parts of the\r\ncity as Vashti unbarred the gate of her dwelling, a gate that had not\r\nopened for many weeks.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that impressed her was the strange stillness that\r\nprevailed around, “_a deep silence and a kind of deadly night_,” to use\r\nthe language of the contemporary historian. The street was empty; every\r\nhouse, like her own, was shut and barred.\r\n\r\nSignificant fact! What silent tragedies, what scenes of anguish, were\r\ntaking place behind those closed doors and latticed windows?\r\n\r\nAs she stepped out into the street her eye was caught by a startling\r\nobject. Hanging by a rope from a hook fixed into an adjacent wall was\r\na shriveled and mummified corpse, that of a man, who, doubtless unable\r\nlonger to endure the agonies of slow starvation, had chosen to hasten\r\nhis end by suicide. The thought that before her journey’s end she was\r\nlikely to see other sights like this, or even more ghastly, almost\r\ndrove her within the house again, but her mother’s wrath and Arad’s\r\nhunger spurred her on, and she walked away as quickly as her weakness\r\nwould let her.\r\n\r\nA few paces, and she saw lying within the entrance of a narrow archway\r\nthe body of a woman but recently dead, a woman with a frame emaciated\r\nby famine, the skin tightly drawn over her bones, the veins on her\r\nshriveled neck showing like sinews. Pillowed upon her arm lay an infant\r\nwhose hand convulsively grasped his mother’s withered breast, twisting\r\nit with his fingers, and uttering feeble little cries of anger at\r\nfinding himself deprived of sustenance. Pity for the mother, a greater\r\npity for the babe, put Vashti in a state of hesitation. To leave the\r\ninfant dying there was an unnatural act; on the other hand, where was\r\nthe good in taking it to her own home? Neither she nor her mother had\r\nthe means of preserving its life. It might as well die under the open\r\nsky as under a roof; and so, steeling her heart, Vashti went slowly on.\r\nBut she got no further than the end of the street; beginning to feel\r\nlike a murderess, she turned back, only to find the infant breathing\r\nits last.\r\n\r\nLeaving mother and babe Vashti went on her way, seeing with a pitying\r\nheart other sights equally grim. The Apocalypse, but recently written,\r\nhad not yet come to her knowledge, or she might have recalled the\r\npassage, “_Their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great\r\ncity._”\r\n\r\nShe entered a silent square, seemingly empty, but a second\r\nglance around showed her on its southern side a group of human\r\nfigures--perhaps twenty in all--men, women, and children, clustered in\r\nvarious attitudes upon the steps of the Royal Synagogue. They took no\r\nnotice of her approach, though her footsteps sounded unnaturally loud\r\nin the strange stillness.\r\n\r\nVashti stopped short, absolutely appalled at their aspect. Though\r\nterribly wasted herself, Vashti was plump compared with these figures.\r\nWith limbs attenuated to those of a skeleton; with eyes deep sunken in\r\ntheir orbit; with cheek-bones projecting hideously; with complexions\r\ndarkened by famine, they looked like weird beings from another world.\r\nMore dreadful than all was the look of unspeakable anguish stamped upon\r\ntheir features; it was the look of men who would never smile more in\r\nthis world. They had come to this spot because from it their beloved\r\ntemple could be seen; and they would fain die with their glazing eyes\r\nfixed to the last upon the lofty golden pinnacles of the white marble\r\nshrine that stood out in all its loveliness against the calm blue sky\r\nof evening.\r\n\r\nDead and dying they lay, stretched athwart the steps. “Those who were\r\njust going to die looked upon those that were gone to their rest\r\nbefore them with dry eyes and open mouths.”[29]\r\n\r\nSuddenly a sound became audible; distant at first, it grew painfully\r\nloud, and at last, with a rattle and a clang, a dozen armed Zealots,\r\nbelonging to John’s party, came marching into the square, their\r\nwell-preserved physique affording a striking contrast to the ghastly\r\ngroup on the synagogue steps. Famine had not yet laid its finger upon\r\n_them_.\r\n\r\nSeemingly in the best of spirits they talked and laughed in rude\r\nfashion, indifferent to the suffering that met them at every point.\r\nAs a matter of fact, they had come out purposely to add to the city’s\r\nsufferings. Four of their number carried a small battering-ram,\r\nintended to force open the doors of such obstinate citizens as were\r\nbent on keeping their own provisions.\r\n\r\nVashti noticed that these Zealots were taking the way that led past the\r\nsynagogue. Not wishing to attract their attention, she crept to the\r\nside of the building, and hid herself behind a buttress, contriving the\r\nwhile, however, to keep watch upon the approaching group.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer she saw to her surprise that the more youthful of\r\nthem were _dressed as women_ in all the bravery of finely dyed garments\r\nand golden anklets that tinkled as they walked; their long, flowing\r\nhair was decked with the _suffa_, a gauzy network, that, attached to\r\nthe headdress, hung down over the shoulders as far as the waist; red\r\ncoloring glowed on their cheeks, while their eyes, to make them appear\r\nlarger and more lustrous, were painted round with _kohl_, and their\r\neyebrows arched and darkened with the same preparation.\r\n\r\nTheir appearance thrilled Vashti with a mysterious and nameless horror;\r\nshe wondered what this feminine garb should mean, not knowing in her\r\ninnocence that the temple had become, under John of Giscala, the seat\r\nof infamies that caused the seer of Patmos to brand the once holy city\r\nwith a fearful name.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots in passing glanced at the silent throng, whose dying\r\nanguish provoked only their savage mirth.\r\n\r\n“More victims for the dead-cart,” laughed one. “Aha!” he continued,\r\nstopping in his walk, and pointing to a ghastly stiffened figure lying\r\nsupine upon the stairs, “whom have we here? Asenath the harlot, as I\r\nlive. One can scarce recognize in her the one-time favorite of old\r\nAnanias. How she stares! Is she living or dead?”\r\n\r\n“Dead!” replied another Zealot.\r\n\r\n“I’ll wager ten shekels she’s living,” cried he who had spoken first.\r\n\r\n“And I’ll wager the same that she’s dead,” answered the second.\r\n\r\n“Good! you hear,” said the first, addressing the rest as desiring them\r\nto be witnesses of the wager.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots had a way of their own--and for sport often practiced\r\nit--of ascertaining whether a body were dead.\r\n\r\nDrawing his blade the first ruffian pulled aside the woman’s robe and\r\npierced her breast with the point of the weapon, an act followed by a\r\nfaint moan, and a slight writhing of the figure.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast lost thy bet, Malchus,” laughed the first ruffian. “She’s\r\nliving.”\r\n\r\n“She’s dead now, at any rate,” answered the second; and, furious at\r\nlosing the wager, he drew his sword and stabbed the woman to the heart.\r\n\r\nAt this a dying man beside her spoke in hollow tones.\r\n\r\n“In the name of God be merciful, and do the like by me. Thrust me\r\nthrough that my anguish may have an end.”\r\n\r\n“Thou wishest to die? Then thou shalt live,” replied Malchus; and,\r\nsheathing his blade, he moved off with the rest of the Zealots, who\r\nlaughed as though the affair were a merry jest.\r\n\r\nWhen silence had descended upon the square again Vashti crept fearfully\r\nforth, and, after hesitating whether or not to return home, she resumed\r\nher slow and trembling way to Ophel, and arrived without further\r\nadventure at the house of Johanan ben Zacchai. It was a humble dwelling\r\nsituated in a street that, like all others in the city, was as quiet as\r\nthe tomb.\r\n\r\nVashti found the gate, as she expected, barred.\r\n\r\nBefore knocking she listened, and detected coming from within a sound\r\nthat caused her heart to leap with hope, for it was a sound like that\r\nproduced when corn is ground between two millstones.\r\n\r\nEven in her dazed and frightened state of mind Vashti could not but\r\nthink it imprudent to be grinding corn within hearing of the street, a\r\nstreet that might be traversed at any moment by ruffianly, food-seeking\r\nZealots.\r\n\r\nThe household of Johanan were evidently not without grain; surely they\r\nwould spare her just a little from their store?\r\n\r\nShe knocked at the gate, and the sound of the grinding, if such it\r\nwere, instantly ceased.\r\n\r\n“They think I am a Zealot,” she said with a wild little laugh.\r\n\r\nShe knocked a second and a third time, but received no reply; she\r\ncalled out her name so loudly that those within must have heard who the\r\nvisitor was, but they made no response. A dead silence prevailed within.\r\n\r\nVashti withdrew to the middle of the street, and turned her despairing\r\neyes towards the lattice over the gateway. No friendly face looked down\r\nat her; no face at all.\r\n\r\nShe turned sorrowfully away, but came again presently, and this she\r\ncontinued to do at intervals, beating piteously upon the gate, but all\r\nto no purpose.\r\n\r\nThen did hope die within her. If Johanan ben Zacchai would not listen\r\nto the voice of a suppliant, there was none other in the city that\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nNothing remained for her but to return home; but how could she,\r\nempty-handed, face the despairing gaze of her dying mother, the\r\nfearful, famishing eyes of little Arad, who quite expected to see his\r\nsister come back laden with food.\r\n\r\nLoth to return home she wandered slowly and aimlessly through the\r\nstreets and squares of the star-lit city.\r\n\r\nIn the Xystus that faced the half-burned palace of Agrippa she came\r\nupon a group of men, all bearing the signet-mark of famine--the\r\nskeleton limbs, the dark complexion, the sunken eyes of unnatural\r\nluster with the scared look in them.\r\n\r\nLeaning upon staves they were listening to one of those self-deluded\r\nfanatics, so numerous at that time in Jerusalem--fanatics whose dream\r\nno reverses could destroy, the dream namely of a coming universal\r\nempire for the Jews; the darker and the more hopeless the situation\r\nseemed, the more fervent and enthusiastic became the faith of these\r\nfalse prophets, who did not relinquish their hopes till they saw the\r\ntemple sink into everlasting night, and the plow drawn over the soil\r\nwhere once the palace of Zion had stood.\r\n\r\nVashti paused for a moment to listen to his wild harangue.\r\n\r\n“Think you that Jehovah will let the place in which He has chosen to\r\nput His name fall into the hands of the uncircumcized heathen? Men,\r\nbrethren, there is no contradiction in the Divine nature, and therefore\r\nHe who decreed that the temple should be built can never decree that\r\nit shall be destroyed. Take heart and rejoice! The time foretold by\r\nthe prophets is at hand: the heavens shall open, and the Messiah shall\r\ndescend therefrom--yea! it is but a matter of a few hours now--to\r\navenge His people. His feet shall stand upon Olivet, and with the\r\nbreath of His mouth will He slay the host of Titus even as He slew the\r\nhost of Sennacherib.”\r\n\r\nAnd so speciously did he argue by texts drawn from the prophetical\r\nscriptures that his famishing auditors, with scarcely strength to\r\nstand, became as hopeful as the orator himself; they forgot their\r\npresent sufferings; their faces brightened, and they turned their\r\nglance upward to the comet gleaming red in the sky, half-expecting to\r\nsee it launch forth fiery death at the girdling hostile line that,\r\n“hushed in grim repose,” was patiently waiting the slow but certain\r\ndoom of the city.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh Vashti passed on, and coming to a street corner beheld the\r\nemaciated figure of a man kneeling, in his hand a drawn bow with an\r\narrow fitted thereto. Never had she seen eyes so fiercely wild, or an\r\nexpression so painfully eager and expectant. Following the direction\r\nof his glance she saw that he was aiming at a pigeon which had just\r\nalighted upon the ground only a few yards distant. “Food, food! Life,\r\nlife!” was the thought that frenzied his brain.\r\n\r\nBut Vashti could see what he could not, namely, that much nearer to the\r\nbird, and crouching down within a gateway was the skeleton figure of\r\na woman, whose manner showed that she was waiting to snatch the prize\r\nfrom the archer. And so it proved. As the shaft flew true to the mark\r\nthe woman tottered feebly from her hiding-place; her eyes sparkled with\r\nwild glee; she gave a demoniacal chuckle as she pounced upon the slain\r\npigeon, and ghoul-like tore greedily at the raw flesh with her teeth.\r\n\r\nAt that sight there broke from the man a cry of surprise and despair,\r\nof agony and rage, a cry horrible yet pitiable to hear. “Thief! bitch!\r\naccursed!” he screamed. “Give me what is mine. Ah! she would devour it\r\nall! In the name of God give me a mouthful, a morsel, that I may live,\r\nand not die.”\r\n\r\nAs the speaker lurched forward in the endeavor to get at the thief his\r\nlegs gave way beneath him, and he fell heavily to the ground; feebly\r\nstruggling to his feet he staggered on again with intent to wreak\r\nvengeance upon the spoiler.\r\n\r\nOutraged nature did the work for him.\r\n\r\nThe eater gorging herself to the full, and being long unused to the\r\ntaking of so great an amount of sustenance, became suddenly convulsed,\r\ndropped to the ground in horrible contortions, and there and then died,\r\nher end being greeted with mocking laughter by the weakling pursuer,\r\nwho, seemingly undeterred by her fate, knelt down, and plucking the\r\nremnant of the bird from the dead woman’s teeth began to gnaw it with\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nVashti, shuddering, turned away, and retracing her steps to Ophel,\r\nsought once more the house of Johanan ben Zacchai. But she stopped\r\naghast ere reaching it.\r\n\r\nIts gate was wide open now, hanging wrecked upon its hinges, with the\r\nbattering-ram that had done the work lying within the entrance.\r\n\r\nFrom the house came the cries as of an old man in pain.\r\n\r\n“Give his limb another twist,” cried a voice that she recognized as\r\nthat of Malchus the Zealot. “We’ll soon make the old graybeard tell\r\nwhere he has concealed his corn.”\r\n\r\nAt the same moment there broke forth from an upper chamber the\r\nthrilling screams of Johanan’s two daughters, painly calling upon their\r\naged father to deliver them from the hands of the lewd and laughing\r\nZealots; for John’s followers made it their boast that if there were a\r\nvirgin in any house they entered there would be none there when they\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nWith the blood about her heart congealing to ice Vashti fled, lest a\r\nlike fate should befall her; fled, not knowing whither she went, not\r\ncaring; fled, till she suddenly found herself facing a great black mass\r\nthat rose up into the starry night. It was the wall of Zion, the huge\r\nrampart of masonry that lay between the Romans and victory, that lay,\r\nalas! betwixt herself and Crispus. She was near the Valley Gate, whose\r\napproaches as she saw were guarded by a small party of Zealots, while\r\non the battlements above them slow-pacing sentinels kept their watch.\r\nHastily Vashti retreated within the shadows ere she should be seen.\r\n\r\nBy the gate stood Simon the Black. An unpleasant odor, so palpable that\r\none could almost taste it, hung in the air; and this was doubtless his\r\nreason for holding in his hand a perfume box whose fragrance he inhaled\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nAt intervals there came from beyond the city walls weird, plaintive\r\ncries, mysterious voices as of human creatures in pain; the sounds,\r\nborne on the wings of the night, seemed to come like arrows to the\r\nheart of Vashti, thrilling her with an unknown fear. The strange odor\r\nand the eerie sounds--what did they mean? The apparent unconcern of the\r\nmen about the gate showed that to them at least these were familiar\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nConversing apart with Simon was a somewhat sad-eyed man, by name\r\nManneus, the scribe appointed to take note of all the dead carried\r\nforth through the Valley Gate; for be it known that the bodies of the\r\ndead as being like to create a plague if allowed to remain in the city\r\nwere collected at night by paid agents of the Sanhedrim, thrown upon\r\ncarts, and carried out to be promiscuously flung, without funeral rites\r\nand without burial, into the ravines that surrounded Jerusalem; all\r\nwhich matters were as yet unknown to Vashti.\r\n\r\n“How many, think you, up to yester even have been borne forth from this\r\ngate?” asked Manneus of Simon.\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand, perhaps,” replied the Zealot, hazarding a guess.\r\n\r\n“_One hundred and fifteen thousand, eight hundred and eighty_,”[30]\r\nreturned Manneus, consulting his tablets.\r\n\r\nEven Simon, little prone to emotion, was staggered by these figures.\r\n\r\n“Fire of Gehenna!” he muttered. “And this is but one gate! How many\r\nfrom each of the other gates? Our Jewish brethren from foreign lands\r\nwhose wish it is to be buried at Jerusalem seem to be having their\r\nwish,” he added grimly. “But, ah! whom have we here?”\r\n\r\nThis last question was caused by the action of Vashti, who, moved by\r\nsome uncontrollable impulse, came tremblingly forward, and addressed to\r\nhim a pitiful plaint for bread.\r\n\r\n“Bread?” repeated the Zealot. “Why comest thou to me?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are as a king in this city.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said one of the Zealots, recognizing Vashti, “this damsel is\r\nof the Nazarenes, who were forever preaching the doom of the city. She\r\nis, moreover, the ward of Josephus, that traitor, who is high in the\r\ncouncils of the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“A Nazarene, true. Yet,” answered Vashti, eager to seize upon any\r\nargument that might influence the Zealot chief in her favor, “yet did\r\nI not quit the city, when the Nazarenes left it, but have remained\r\nbehind to share the fate of my fellow-citizens. In the name of God,”\r\nshe continued, addressing Simon, “give me bread. I ask not for myself,\r\nbut for a dying child. Give me but one loaf, and on the resurrection\r\nmorning, when all deeds will be brought to light, this shall be counted\r\nto you for righteousness.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have a loaf,” said Simon, moved strangely by her words, “you\r\nshall have a basket ... a basket filled with bread.” The bewildered\r\nVashti could scarcely trust her hearing. “But ere you return home you\r\nmust eat a morsel yourself, or you will faint by the way. Come with me.”\r\n\r\nVashti, loth to go with him, yet not daring to refuse, accompanied\r\nSimon to the tower adjacent to the Valley Gate. Entering the first room\r\nthat he came to, the Zealot chief peremptorily ordered out of it three\r\nor four of his followers who were sitting there occupied with dice and\r\nwine.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said he, addressing Vashti, when the men had withdrawn, “here\r\nare six dried grapes, a fig, and a morsel of bread. No more at present.\r\nPut a curb upon your appetite, if you would live.”\r\n\r\nTo Vashti’s mind there was something selfish in eating while thousands\r\nof her fellow-citizens were dying of want--doubly selfish, when she\r\nreflected that this food had perhaps been wrung by violence from the\r\nfamishing people. Natural appetite, however, prevailed over sentiment;\r\nand with a strange feeling towards Simon, a feeling compounded of\r\ngratitude and repulsion, Vashti began the slow eating of what was to\r\nher a repast more delicious than that in the banquet-hall of Florus,\r\nthough her enjoyment was somewhat marred by the unpleasant odor that\r\nseemed to cling around everything in this vicinity. That she did not\r\nknow its cause seemed to surprise Simon. Perceiving that her ignorance\r\nwas real and not feigned, he rose, and said, “Come with me, if you\r\nwould learn.”\r\n\r\nVashti began to regret her curiosity, being all-anxious now to return\r\nhome with the promised loaves. Not wishing, however, to offend the\r\nZealot she followed him up a stone staircase, and through a doorway\r\nthat opened upon the ramparts.\r\n\r\nSimon, first handing her his perfume box, bade her look down over the\r\nbattlements.\r\n\r\nAnd Vashti looked.\r\n\r\nIt was a moonless night, but the sky was jeweled with stars whose\r\nfaint light was just sufficient to give her a glimmering of what lay\r\nbelow. It was the light required for such a scene: the full blaze of\r\nthe noonday sun would have made it a horror too great to be endured by\r\nhuman nerves.\r\n\r\n“_They shall look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed\r\nagainst me!_”\r\n\r\nVashti, peering down, could dimly see that the deep and shadowy\r\nravine of Hinnom--that ravine already regarded in Hebrew theology as\r\nthe type of hell--was filled with the remains of the dead, who were to\r\nbe counted not by hundreds, but by tens of thousands. The bodies lay,\r\npiled promiscuously, some clothed, some naked, in every possible stage\r\nof decay, from that of the newly dead to that of the whitened skeleton\r\nglimmering ghastly through the gloom.\r\n\r\nThe air that hung above and around the ravine was tainted with an\r\neffluvium so gross as to be all but palpable to the touch, and so\r\nloathsome that but for the perfume box Vashti would have sunk to the\r\nground overpowered.\r\n\r\nMore dreadful still, from every part of the gloom came significant and\r\nhorrid rustlings, intermingled with sounds like to the tearing of flesh\r\nby some sharp instrument.\r\n\r\n“Mark!” said Simon.\r\n\r\nHe flung over a stone; at its sudden and startling descent a black\r\ncloud of ravens and vultures, gorged with human flesh, rose on the\r\nwing, high above the battlements, their slow-sailing shadows darkening\r\nthe face of the sky.\r\n\r\nVashti, as they passed, drew back with a shudder, and as she did so,\r\nher eyes fell upon a sight still more startling and awful. _Now_ she\r\nknew the origin of the weird and midnight cries!\r\n\r\nThere, beyond the ravine, under the cold light of the pitiless stars,\r\nwere rows upon rows of crosses; and to every cross was nailed a naked\r\nhuman form!\r\n\r\nThe number of these crosses was past all counting; they circled the\r\nwhole city, extending as far back as the Roman wall, whose castellated\r\noutline was dimly visible from the battlements. How many of the\r\ncrucified victims were dead; how many were bearing their sufferings\r\nin heroic silence; how many had reached the sullen stupor that is the\r\nimmediate precursor of death, it was impossible to tell. Vashti might\r\nhave thought all dead, but that every now and then some poor wretch,\r\nnow in this quarter and now in that, lifting his hitherto bowed head\r\nwould shiver convulsively, and would break the stillness of the night\r\nby a long-drawn mournful cry of pain, a cry that might have caused the\r\ncoldest, sternest nature to weep, but seemed to have no effect upon\r\nSimon.\r\n\r\n“In God’s name, who are these?” gasped Vashti.\r\n\r\n“Jewish deserters. It is thus that Titus receives those that come to\r\nhim from the city, nor do I pity them. Let them die; they deserve their\r\ndoom. Mark,” he continued, “mark the ill-fortune that has attended all\r\nwho have deserted the holy cause! In the early days of the siege Titus\r\nwas wont to receive such renegades with favor, a favor, however, that\r\nproved the doom of many, who, eating too freely of the food given to\r\nthem, burst, and so died.” He paused, with a vindictive smile, and then\r\nresumed. “They were succeeded by other deserters, who, ere leaving the\r\ncity, swallowed gold pieces and precious stones, thinking to recover\r\nthem after they had passed the Roman lines. Fatal avarice! The secret\r\nbecame known to the Syrian and Arabian allies deputed to take charge of\r\nthese deserters; they slew them and cut open their bodies to get at the\r\ntreasures. In this way were two thousand of them killed in one night.”\r\nAgain he smiled vindictively. “At last Titus, growing stern, as he saw\r\nthe little progress made by his arms, sent to our walls a herald to\r\nproclaim that he would receive no more deserters; let the whole body\r\nof the people come forth, or none. Regardless of this decree, fresh\r\nparties made their way to the Roman camp, to be sent back to the city,\r\na shrieking train of victims, with their hands lopped off.” Again that\r\nvindictive smile. “And now,” added Simon, pointing to the ghastly scene\r\nbefore them, “now he hath taken to this way of dealing with them. _They\r\nare crucified to the number of five hundred a day!_”\r\n\r\nThe vengeance of history!\r\n\r\nThese were the men, and the sons of the men, who forty years earlier\r\nhad cried “Crucify Him! crucify Him!” And now they themselves were\r\ncrucified--some on the very site of Golgotha itself!--in such numbers\r\nthat, in the language of Josephus, “room was wanting for the crosses,\r\nand crosses wanting for the bodies.” And the victims, if they but chose\r\nto look, could see overhead in the sky the red gleam of the heavenly\r\nsword. Stay! was it the figure of a sword, or was it not rather _the\r\nlikeness of a cross_, intended to remind them of the greatest and most\r\nawful tragedy in the world’s history?\r\n\r\nVashti’s head swam with horror; a mist obscured her vision; air and\r\nlandscape seemed slowly turning to one universal blood-red hue. Her\r\nwild wail went forth upon the night air:\r\n\r\n“O God, have mercy upon this hapless city!”\r\n\r\nIt was past the sixth hour of the night when Vashti, with her basket of\r\nbread upon her arm, reached home.\r\n\r\nClosing and barring the gate behind her, she went along the short\r\npassage, and crossed the little court.\r\n\r\nEntering a chamber upon the ground floor she paused for a moment and\r\nstood in the attitude of listening. She had so expected to hear Arad’s\r\nplaintive cry for food that it was almost a disappointment to find\r\nthe house as silent as the tomb. Evidently Arad was sleeping, unless\r\nindeed----! Her heart almost stood still at the dread thought that\r\nsuddenly smote her. But no! she was alarming herself without cause. A\r\ntwo days’ fast, though it might very much weaken a child, would not\r\nkill him. Arad must be sleeping.\r\n\r\nShe smiled lovingly as she pictured his delight when he should awake\r\nand see what his sister had brought him.\r\n\r\nIf mother and son were sleeping it could not be otherwise that the\r\nhouse should be without sound; yet in the prevailing stillness that\r\nhung about the place like a tangible veil there was something so\r\nstrange and oppressive as to fill Vashti with vague fears. Her tread\r\non entering had sounded so hollow that she had paused, almost fearing\r\nto take a second step. For the first time in her life she feared the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nPlucking up her courage, she moved through the gloom towards the\r\nstairway that stood in one corner of the room. When she was half-way\r\nacross the floor her foot touched some object; moved by curiosity she\r\nstooped, and picking the thing up found it to be--_a long knife_!\r\n\r\nNow when Vashti had last gone through this room there was no knife\r\nlying upon the floor; her sandal had become loose upon this very spot;\r\nshe had knelt to tie the string, and the knife, had it been lying there\r\nat that time, could scarcely have failed to come within the ken of\r\nher vision. Evidently someone must have entered this room during her\r\nabsence; doubtless Miriam.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing strange in the fact that her mother, if so minded,\r\nshould leave the upper story and descend to the court, yet Vashti\r\ncould not help wondering why Miriam should have removed the knife from\r\nits customary place upon the shelf, since it was the one used only in\r\nthe culinary operations, this room being the kitchen of the little\r\nhousehold. But that existing circumstances forbade the hypothesis, the\r\nknife might have been taken as evidence almost of the preparation of a\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nAs if expecting the darkness to furnish some clew Vashti looked\r\nvacantly around, and there upon the floor distant but a few feet, and\r\nscintillating through the gloom, was a something that had the semblance\r\nof an eye, an eye intently watching all her movements.\r\n\r\nIt stared at her a while, blinked, glittered again, then the eyelid\r\nseemed to close, and there was darkness where the thing had been.\r\n\r\nVashti gave a little insane laugh of relief, perceiving that what had\r\nfrightened her was no eye at all, but a faint point of light upon the\r\nhearth, the last spark of some dying embers. It was clear that during\r\nher absence a fire had been kindled in this room, and by whom, if not\r\nby her mother? and this fact when taken with the knife would seem to\r\npoint to the preparation of food. If so, by what means had Miriam\r\nbecome so fortunate? After what Vashti had seen that night it was\r\nscarcely credible that, Zealots excepted, there could be anyone in this\r\nfamishing city so well provided as to be capable of giving relief to\r\nothers. Such being the case, then, what was the meaning to be put upon\r\nthe fire and the knife?\r\n\r\nInstead of hastening at once to her mother’s room Vashti lingered in\r\nthis chamber, impressed somehow by the belief that here was to be found\r\nthe key to the mystery. Though entirely ignorant as to its nature, she\r\nnevertheless felt certain that she was on the verge of some startling\r\ndiscovery, and she trembled all over.\r\n\r\nSlowly she drew near the hearth; over it the air still hung warm. Her\r\nfeet pressed upon some light yielding material like cloth. Cloth it\r\nwas, a little woollen garment belonging to Arad; nay more, certain\r\nfringes upon it told her that it was the little caftan he had been\r\nwearing when she last parted from him. What strange whim had induced\r\nher mother to deprive the child of his one and only garment? Had it\r\nbeen exchanged for another? If so, it was not easy to see the reason,\r\nor why the old one should have been brought down, and left lying by the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nWondering whether there were anything else here belonging to Arad she\r\nput forth her hands, and grasped a little girdle and two sandals.\r\n\r\nA moment she stood in bewilderment: then, as the ghastly truth came\r\nrushing upon her mind, there broke from her a cry so awful as to seem\r\nscarcely human; the fear of the thing caused her hair to bristle, and\r\nthe cold drops to start from every pore.\r\n\r\nAll the appalling tragedies she had seen that night--what were they\r\ncompared with this?\r\n\r\nShe turned and ran up the staircase, her frenzy of grief giving her a\r\nstrength so great that armed men could scarcely have had the power to\r\nstay her.\r\n\r\nWith a quick tread she entered the upper chamber. It was dark, yet\r\nnot quite dark: the light of the stars seen through the open lattice\r\nsufficed to make the nearer objects faintly visible. Miriam lay in the\r\nmiddle of the apartment asleep upon her pallet. It was not to her that\r\nVashti first turned. Though knowing well that she would not find him\r\nthere, she nevertheless ran at once to Arad’s pallet.\r\n\r\nIt was empty!\r\n\r\nShe flew to her mother’s side, knelt, and peered shudderingly into\r\nthe somnolent face, a face that wore at this moment the dull heavy\r\nair as of one whose animal wants are satisfied. Her mother actually\r\n_sleeping_, as if this were merely some ordinary night! sleeping, after\r\nsuch a deed as hers! Sleeping--she who ought never to sleep again!\r\n\r\nThere was little of the daughter left in Vashti as she fiercely shook\r\nthe slumbering woman by the shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd the soul of the unhappy Miriam starting from blissful dreams to\r\nthe dread reality of earthly things awoke to hear sounding through the\r\ngloom of night a voice that, like the voice of the accusing archangel,\r\naddressed her with the awful question:\r\n\r\n“WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH ARAD?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                          THE RESCUE OF VASHTI\r\n\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander, the apostate Jew, and Crispus, with four\r\nlegionaries attending on them, stood at the foot of the city wall at\r\nthe point where masonry, carried aloft to an amazing height, supported\r\nthe Colonnade of Solomon.\r\n\r\nThe night, bright and starry in its earlier part, had now become\r\nclouded and dark, an event that seemed to give satisfaction to\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n“The darker the night, the more likely am I to discover something,” he\r\nobserved, from which remark it was clear to Crispus that Alexander had\r\nsome special reason for bringing him to this spot, a spot that was a\r\nsore trial to the olfactory sense, owing to the effluvium arising from\r\nthe dead bodies in the ravine of Cedron.\r\n\r\nInto that ravine Alexander was now gazing. He could quote the Hebrew\r\nprophets on occasion; usually, however, to ridicule them.\r\n\r\n“‘Son of man,’” said he mockingly to Crispus, “‘can these dry bones\r\nlive?’”\r\n\r\n“My answer is that of the scribes whose teaching you have deserted,”\r\nretorted Crispus. “That which was not, came into being; how much more,\r\nthen, that which has been already?”\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander might perhaps have replied to this celebrated,\r\nrabbinical argument but that his attention was attracted at that moment\r\nby the sudden appearance of a light at a window in one of the castella\r\nor forts on the Roman line of contravallation.\r\n\r\nThree times did the light flash, and then it vanished.\r\n\r\n“You saw it?” said he to Crispus. “So, too, have I seen it, on other\r\nnights than this. There can be no doubt that it is a signal to the Jews\r\nin the city. We have a traitor in our camp. By remaining here we shall,\r\nif I err not, discover who he is. Keep we in the shadow of this crag.”\r\n\r\n“Is not yon castellum the one in which King Agrippa is quartered?”\r\nwhispered Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Thou hast said,” replied Alexander.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the little party remained silent and expectant. At last\r\na sound was heard above their heads like the clanking of metal against\r\nmasonry, and looking up they saw coming down through the darkness a\r\nvery large basket of strong wicker-work attached to the end of an iron\r\nchain. It touched the ground and there remained.\r\n\r\n“Empty,” remarked Alexander, taking a peep into it. “It is as I\r\nsuspected. This is lowered by the priests for the reception of\r\nsomething to be put into it by the man who signaled with the light. And\r\nhere comes the traitor himself.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there came stealing along at the foot of the city wall a\r\nman whose garb showed him to be a soldier belonging to King Agrippa’s\r\ntroops. He was leading a file of lambs attached to one another by a\r\ncord. Having arrived at his destination the man was about to lift\r\none of the animals into the basket when he stopped short in guilty\r\nconfusion upon seeing Alexander, who chose that very moment for making\r\nhis presence known.\r\n\r\n“Are you not Sadas, the freedman of the Princess Berenice?”\r\n\r\nThe soldier admitted that he was. Then did Crispus recognize in him the\r\nman who had denounced Vashti in the Royal Synagogue.\r\n\r\n“Ah! that puts a different complexion on this affair, which is not so\r\ngrave as I had thought it. These lambs, presumably from Bethlehem, none\r\nothers being permissible on the temple-altar, are sent by the Princess\r\nBerenice in order that the morning and the evening sacrifices may not\r\ncease for want of victims. Is it not so, my Sadas? The supply above\r\nis running short, I ween. Now I have a great regard for the princess,\r\nbut it seems to me that the fair lady’s zeal for her religion borders\r\nclosely upon treason to us Romans. It were foolish of us to permit\r\nsacrifices to Jehovah here, after Theomantes hath so kindly invited\r\nhim to take up his dwelling in the Capitol. Therefore, as my men, not\r\nto speak of myself, are very fond of roast lamb, do you, Quintus, lead\r\nthese animals to my tent, and place this fellow under ward. To-morrow\r\nwe’ll inquire further into the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers proceeded to do as bidden.\r\n\r\n“I would we had a dozen swine to put into this basket,” continued\r\nAlexander, giving it a contemptuous kick.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the priests on the cloister above observing that the\r\nlambs were being taken back to the Roman camp by a party of soldiers,\r\nsaw that the affair had somehow miscarried and began to haul up the\r\nbasket again.\r\n\r\nWhile Tiberius Alexander followed close upon the heels of the soldiers,\r\nCrispus lingered in the vicinity of the walls, his mind tortured almost\r\nto madness at the thought of what might be happening to Vashti in this\r\nlong and cruel process of starving the obstinate city into submission.\r\nFor all he knew to the contrary, she might be lying at that very moment\r\namong the festering horrors of the glen of Cedron, her body torn by the\r\nbeak and claw of obscene birds of prey, to be seen no more by him till\r\nthe resurrection morning, when these “dry bones” would live again, to\r\nshame the doctrine of the mocking Alexander.\r\n\r\nThe air grew darker, so dark that a circle of a few yards only was the\r\nlimit of Crispus’ vision; all beyond was blackness.\r\n\r\nAn ideal night for the enemy if they were minded to attack the Roman\r\nentrenchments!\r\n\r\nScarcely had this thought occurred to Crispus when he heard, or fancied\r\nhe heard, a sound proceeding from a point not many yards distant. He\r\nlistened intently. Footsteps, not loud, but quiet footsteps; not of one\r\nman but, so it seemed to Crispus, of three or four men, all walking in\r\na stealthy sort of way, as if wishing to keep their movements a secret.\r\nThey were coming slowly through the darkness right towards the place\r\nwhere he stood. In another moment they would be upon him.\r\n\r\nRomans on some errand of espial? or a party of Jewish deserters?\r\n\r\nBracing his buckler upon his arm and drawing his sword Crispus awaited\r\ntheir approach.\r\n\r\nAs the men--they were three in number--came into view he bade them\r\nhalt, which they did with surprising promptitude. Questioning on\r\nthe part of Crispus elicited the fact that they were Jews, passover\r\npilgrims from Asia, detained by the war: appointed to guard a portion\r\nof the wall in Ophel they had, through despair of the city’s salvation,\r\nresolved to desert; and so, tying a rope to a battlement, they had let\r\nthemselves down.\r\n\r\nThe madness of these men! Though the crucifixions of Jewish fugitives\r\namounted to five hundred a day, the stream of defection from the city\r\nnever ceased, the deserters hoping, in spite of failure on the part of\r\ntheir predecessors, to steal secretly through the Roman lines, or, if\r\nneed be, force a way at the sword’s point.\r\n\r\n“How long is it since ye fled?”\r\n\r\n“Less than the fourth part of an hour,” replied one whose name was\r\nAsaph.\r\n\r\n“Is the rope still hanging there?”\r\n\r\n“Surely. How could we, when on the ground, detach it from the\r\nbattlement?”\r\n\r\n“Think you that your flight is known?”\r\n\r\n“We purposely waited till the night-watch had gone by, and left the\r\nmoment afterwards; therefore our flight will not be discovered for some\r\ntime yet.”\r\n\r\n“Is it yours to watch the same part of the wall every night?”\r\n\r\n“Till the next Sabbath.”\r\n\r\nThese questions of Crispus were inspired by a daring idea that had\r\nsuddenly darted into his mind.\r\n\r\nA rope hanging from the city wall at a part deserted by its watchers!\r\n\r\nWhy should he not enter the city by the same means as that by which\r\nthese men had left it? His object in this enterprise was to find\r\nVashti, and having found her to bring her out of this city of death,\r\nand to put her into some safe place of concealment, thereby defeating\r\nthe wicked scheme of Berenice. But his plan, as he rapidly conceived\r\nit, required the co-operation of these three Jews, and there lay the\r\ndifficulty: they might refuse to join him, or, deceiving him by a\r\npretended assent, turn traitors at the very moment of his seeming\r\nsuccess. Nevertheless, desperate as the plan was, he determined to take\r\nthe risks.\r\n\r\n“Hearken unto me, Asaph, and ye two,” said Crispus, adopting a Hebrew\r\nphraseology, to make his address the more impressive. “As the Lord\r\nliveth, before whom I stand, if ye attempt to pass the Roman lines\r\nwithout me ye are dead men. But fear not, I will go with you and save\r\nyou. Yet will I not go with you to-night, but to-morrow night. Ye must\r\nreturn, and resume your post upon the wall. I will go with you, not to\r\nbetray the city, but to seek therein a damsel, whose life I would save.\r\n’Tis an easy matter for me to mount the wall by the rope ye have left,\r\nbut how am I to return, unless the wall be held by those friendly to\r\nme? Therefore ye must delay your flight by twenty-four hours. To-morrow\r\nnight about this time when ye are again playing the part of sentinels I\r\nwill come to you bringing the damsel, and that hour shall be the hour\r\nof your departure.\r\n\r\n“Know that I am Crispus the Tribune, high in the favor of Titus, and\r\ntherefore capable of fulfilling my word. Now, if ye will aid me in\r\nthis, my soul’s desire, I will conduct you to the Roman camp, and send\r\nyou away in safety; but if ye will not do this thing, then go on your\r\nway alone to meet whatever doom befall you. Now, delay not your answer,\r\nfor the success of my scheme depends upon your speedy return to the\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nThe three men whispered together. They were not long in coming to a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n“Swear in the name of the Lord that you will save our soul alive,” said\r\nAsaph, “and we will aid thee in this matter.”\r\n\r\nUnder the black sky the strange compact was made, the three men\r\ntaking Crispus to be a Hebrew proselyte, a belief in which he did not\r\nundeceive them.\r\n\r\n“Let us return at once,” said Asaph, “ere our flight be discovered.”\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his new-sworn allies Crispus began the steep ascent\r\nof Ophel, climbing with all silence and caution, and grateful to the\r\ndarkness that hid them from the view of the sentinel Zealots above.\r\n\r\nArrived at the foot of the ramparts they crept along, Asaph leading the\r\nway, till a point was reached where the semicircular base of a huge\r\nprojecting tower made an angle with the wall. Within this angle, and\r\nscarcely discernible in the dark, hung a rope attached to a battlement\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n“A good sign, this,” said Crispus in a whisper. “Had these battlements\r\nbeen visited in your absence this rope would surely have been detected\r\nand drawn up.”\r\n\r\nClambering up hand over hand the three Jews ascended the rope, and\r\ndisappearing over the battlements proceeded to haul up their new ally.\r\n\r\nThe portion of wall allotted to their care proved to be about twenty\r\nyards in length, terminated at each end by two circular towers--the\r\ntower in Siloam, and “the tower that lieth out”--which effectually\r\nscreened them from the observation of the sentinels disposed along the\r\nrest of the wall.\r\n\r\n“Can you not bring the damsel here within the hour, and so make an end\r\nof the matter this night?” asked Asaph anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Right gladly would I do so, but that I fear the finding of her will be\r\na work of time, and within an hour from now day will be dawning. Can\r\nyou hide this, my crested helmet, or ’twill betray me? and if you can\r\nfind me a cloak----”\r\n\r\nAsaph entered one of the towers and returned with a Jewish cap, and\r\nwith a gabardine, beneath which Crispus found effectual concealment for\r\nhis military garb.\r\n\r\n“At what hour of the night do you begin your vigil?”\r\n\r\n“Ours is the third watch and lasts from the sixth hour till the ninth.”\r\n\r\n“Look for me a little after the sixth hour. As a sign that all is\r\nwell fix a spear erect upon the middle of the rampart. Unless I see\r\nit standing out clear against the sky I will not draw near. And now\r\nfarewell for a time. Keep to your oath, and it shall go well with you.”\r\n\r\nAs Crispus descended the stone stairway that led to the ground he\r\ncongratulated himself upon the ease with which he had contrived to\r\nenter the city. Would he be able, however, to quit it with similar\r\nease? That depended chiefly upon the fidelity of his new associates,\r\nand since they could hardly betray him without betraying themselves he\r\nfelt somewhat assured. Turning from the wall of Ophel he set off for\r\nthe street of Millo on Mount Zion.\r\n\r\nWhen lying convalescent upon the roof of Miriam’s dwelling Crispus\r\nhad had ample leisure to study the topography both of Ophel and Zion;\r\nthis knowledge stood him now in good stead, and though, owing to the\r\ndarkness, he once or twice missed his way, he finally found himself in\r\nthe gray light of dawn before the gate of the house he sought.\r\n\r\nHe was about to knock at the gate when it suddenly opened, and there\r\nappeared in the entrance the figure of a young woman terribly emaciated\r\nby famine. She was habited as if for a journey.\r\n\r\n“Is Vashti, daughter of Hyrcanus, within?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\nThe figure gave a smile. _Such_ a smile! One more fearful and weird he\r\nhad never seen.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know me, Crispus?”\r\n\r\nHe started, looked at her again, and could scarcely recognize her, so\r\nfearfully had she changed from the beautiful maiden of other days.\r\n\r\n“Vashti, my poor girl, can this be you?”\r\n\r\nTo see her looking thus caused the tears to come welling to his eyes.\r\nHis weeping caused her likewise to weep. Then ever mindful of others,\r\nrather than of herself, she suddenly said, amid her tears:\r\n\r\n“Crispus, what do you here in this city of your enemies? Oh, if you\r\nshould be discovered!”\r\n\r\n“What do I here?” he repeated. “This is the answer to that question,”\r\nhe continued, tenderly lifting her hand that she might see how thin it\r\nwas. “You are slowly dying of starvation, and yet you ask what do I\r\nhere. I have come to snatch you from death by carrying you away to the\r\nRoman camp.”\r\n\r\nVashti looked at him with a fearful joy in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh! if you could! if you could! I was just going to Simon of Gerasa to\r\nimplore him to let me leave the city----”\r\n\r\n“You shall not ask Simon’s leave. That I have entered the city safely,\r\nyou can see for yourself. By what means I have entered by that same\r\nmeans shall you leave.” He smiled cheerfully as he closed and barred\r\nthe gate. “To-morrow about this time,” he added, “you shall be feasting\r\nin the Roman camp, you, and your mother, and little Arad.”\r\n\r\nBut at the mention of this last name Vashti wept like one heartbroken.\r\n\r\n“Arad,” she said, “Arad--is--is----”\r\n\r\nCrispus guessed the cause of her emotion.\r\n\r\n“What! is the poor little fellow dead?”\r\n\r\n“If you had but come yesterday!” she sobbed. “Oh! if you had but come\r\nyesterday, my brother might be living.”\r\n\r\nSeeing that she had scarcely strength to stand, Crispus lifted her in\r\nhis arms, and carried her into the court.\r\n\r\n“No, not that side!” said she, shivering, as he was about to enter the\r\nhouse by way of the room where her dreadful discovery had taken place.\r\n“Not that side!”\r\n\r\nSo Crispus carried her to a chamber that opened from a different part\r\nof the court, and producing the leathern wallet carried by every Roman\r\nsoldier, he drew from it figs and bread and made her eat before he\r\nwould let her say another word.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished the simple repast she told him the terrible story\r\nof a child slain by a famishing mother to satisfy her appetite; and\r\nCrispus listened, knowing from deserters’ tales that deeds equally dark\r\nhad been perpetrated in other households besides this.\r\n\r\n“And because I have reproached her--was I wrong in so doing?--my mother\r\nhas cursed me, and has bidden me leave her and go to my friends, the\r\nRomans. I call her mother,” she added, “for I cannot easily rid myself\r\nof the familiar word.”\r\n\r\n“Is she not really your mother, then?” asked Crispus, receiving the\r\nnews with the same satisfaction that Vashti herself had felt at the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n“She has told me--and there was in her manner something that convinces\r\nme she is speaking the truth--that I am her daughter by adoption only.”\r\n\r\n“And I believe it,” said Crispus emphatically, “if only for this\r\nreason, that you are so different from her in every way; and you\r\nhave another proof of it in this, that your name does not appear in\r\nthe public genealogical rolls as the daughter of Hyrcanus. What were\r\nMiriam’s words to you?”\r\n\r\n“When I cried, for I could not help crying it, ‘Would to God you were\r\nnot my mother!’ she laughed and said, ‘You have your wish; I am not\r\nyour mother. You were brought to me when you were a babe of about\r\ntwelve months by my husband Hyrcanus, who found you one winter’s night\r\ncrying among the crags of Mount Hermon, where you had been purposely\r\nleft to perish, and where, but for him, you would have perished. That\r\nis all I know of your origin, save this, that since there hath never\r\nbeen aught of the Jewess in you, I doubt not that you come of Greekish\r\nparents--nay, it would not surprise me to learn that your mother was a\r\nSamaritan, and hence your perverse nature.’”\r\n\r\nA few years earlier the doubt that she was not of the chosen race would\r\nhave troubled Vashti, but now baptized into a faith in which there is\r\nneither Greek nor Jew, neither barbarian nor Scythian, neither bond\r\nnor free, she viewed the question of her nationality as a matter of no\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe two for a while talked of Miriam’s revelation; and then, quitting\r\nthis theme, Crispus proceeded to tell Vashti of an event that he knew\r\nwould interest her, an event the most momentous in his life--namely,\r\nhow, during the time of his proscription, the Christians of Pella had\r\ngiven him harboring, and how he had become a catechumen, receiving\r\ninstruction in the faith from the holy bishop Simeon, and from others\r\nwho had seen the Lord.\r\n\r\n“And when,” concluded Crispus, “I learned that it was Simeon who had\r\nbaptized you, I would not let any other perform that rite for me.”\r\n\r\nNight and day for nearly four years had Vashti prayed for the\r\nconversion of Crispus, and now came the sweet realization of her\r\nprayer! His words seemed to lift her from earth to heaven--but for a\r\nmoment only; like a swift, painful dart came the memory of little Arad,\r\nand she wept. How happy would she now be but for that black deed!\r\n\r\nKnowing the cause of her sadness, Crispus tried to divert the course\r\nof her thoughts by talking of the way in which he hoped to remove her\r\nfrom the city; he made her eat again; and then, learning from her that\r\nshe had been out all the previous night, he bade her sleep. So Vashti,\r\ncompliant with his will, lay down upon a divan, and though sweet\r\noblivion was a long time in coming, it came at last.\r\n\r\nMiriam remained invisible throughout the day, a fact for which Crispus\r\nfelt extremely grateful, since it was not at all unlikely that, if he\r\nwere seen by her, she might, in her hatred of Romans, raise an alarm,\r\nand bring the Zealots upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was much past noon when Vashti awoke. She smiled on learning how\r\nlong she had slept; but it was a wan, sad smile; Arad’s end was ever\r\npresent to her memory.\r\n\r\nThat day was the longest Vashti had ever known, but it came to an end\r\nin due course, and shortly before the sixth hour of the night she\r\ngot ready for her departure. With tears in her eyes she took a last,\r\nlingering look at the silent star-lit court of the dwelling that had\r\nbeen her home since childhood, knowing that she would see the place no\r\nmore; the flaming torch and the iron crow of the Roman were destined\r\nere many weeks had passed to bring this and ten thousand other houses\r\ncrashing to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe two closed the gate behind them, and made their way through the\r\ndark streets.\r\n\r\nAs Vashti drew nigh to the great black wall of Ophel, she looked up and\r\nsaw a sight that made her shudder.\r\n\r\nWas she never to get away from the sight of death?\r\n\r\nThere upon the battlements and standing out in ghastly relief against\r\nthe dark-blue sky of night was a line of lofty posts, twenty-one in\r\nnumber, to each of which was nailed a naked human body!\r\n\r\nPacing to and fro upon the rampart was the Jewish trio, Asaph and his\r\ntwo comrades.\r\n\r\nHaving caught sight of the prearranged sign, the spear set erect,\r\nCrispus, exercising a spirit of caution, bade Vashti remain where she\r\nwas while he went forward to reconnoiter.\r\n\r\nHaving found all satisfactory, Asaph and his companions receiving\r\nhim with unfeigned joy, he returned and assisted Vashti to mount the\r\nstairway ascending to the battlements, where he threw off his Jewish\r\ngabardine, and resumed his crested helmet.\r\n\r\n“Who are these?” asked Vashti, shrinking at the sight of the dead\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\n“Matthias, alas! the one-time high priest, his three sons, and others\r\nof the priesthood. Accused by Simon of corresponding with the Romans\r\nthey were slain to-day by Ananus,[31] the most savage of Simon’s fifty\r\ncaptains, and their bodies hung here on high for Titus to see.”\r\n\r\nOf all the events that had occurred since the beginning of the siege,\r\nthere was in Crispus’ opinion scarcely any more mournful or more\r\nsignificant than this, the death of Matthias, THE LAST OF THE HIGH\r\nPRIESTS--for the irregularly chosen Phannias must be excluded from the\r\ncatalogue--stabbed by the hand of a brutal ruffian, his body denied\r\nsepulture, and exposed naked upon the ramparts of the holy city to\r\nbecome the prey of the fowls of the air.\r\n\r\n“_Non hunc, sed Barabbam!_” had been the cry of the chief priests. And\r\nthis was how Barabbas had rewarded them!\r\n\r\nWhile thinking thus, Crispus made a sudden dash forward, and then stood\r\ndisappointedly peering down the flight of steps.\r\n\r\n“What is amiss?” asked Asaph, seeing excitement written on Crispus’\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“I saw a black shape rise, and run down these stairs.”\r\n\r\nAs Crispus spoke, the deep silence of the night was suddenly broken by\r\nthe startling scream of a trumpet coming from beneath the very part of\r\nthe wall on which he stood. It was the Jewish call to arms.\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate murmur of voices, swelling into a babel of\r\nexcited cries, accompanied by a sudden blazing up of torches in all\r\ndirections. By the ruddy light the little party on the ramparts could\r\nsee hundreds of dark figures racing towards the wall of Ophel, all in a\r\ntempest of Eastern fury.\r\n\r\n“We are lost!” gasped Vashti, her skin, darkened by famine, becoming\r\nwhite now.\r\n\r\n“Have no fear,” responded Crispus cheerily; and, addressing the three\r\nJews, he said in a rapid, staccato utterance, “Make for the rope--lower\r\nthe damsel first--descend yourselves--when the last man is down blow\r\nyour trumpet--AWAY!”\r\n\r\nWith this, Crispus drew his blade; and, taking his station at the head\r\nof the steps, glared down like an eagle upon the coming foe.\r\n\r\nIn the full belief that Crispus’ end was at hand Vashti would fain have\r\nstayed to die with him, but, heeding not her protests, the three Jews\r\nwhirled her off her feet and ran like madmen towards the suspended\r\nrope, their sole means of escape. It was woe to them if they were\r\ncaught!\r\n\r\nThe torch-carrying, saber-brandishing multitude halted at the foot of\r\nthe steps, surprised to see but a single armed Roman, surprised still\r\nmore that that Roman should be preparing to offer resistance.\r\n\r\nThe stair at the head of which Crispus stood formed the sole access to\r\nthe battlements; of narrow width it did not permit two men to stand\r\nabreast; and, moreover, neither on the one side nor on the other\r\nwas it provided with a hand-rail. Strong therefore in his position,\r\nCrispus felt that he could hold the foe in play for a space of time\r\nsufficiently long to enable his confederates to descend the wall; after\r\nwhich it would be a race between himself and the enemy as to which\r\nwould first reach the rope-encircled battlement.\r\n\r\n“A Roman! How came he there?” exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n“Asaph is playing the traitor,” cried a second. “He is admitting the\r\nenemy into the city.”\r\n\r\n“Why, ’tis Crispus the Tribune,” said a third.\r\n\r\n_Crispus!_\r\n\r\nAt the sound of that name, a man--the foremost of the crowd--who had\r\njust put his foot upon the lowest step, immediately withdrew it in\r\nfavor of anyone else that chose to mount.\r\n\r\nCrispus, during the siege, had added to his former fame gained by his\r\ndefense of the Prætorium of Florus; so quick of limb and eye, so deadly\r\ndexterous in fence was he known to be, that it was the confident belief\r\nof almost every Zealot present that the first of their number to reach\r\nthe topmost stair would be a dead man the moment afterwards. Their\r\nstate of hesitancy was highly favorable to the escaping fugitives. A\r\nquick, backward glance on the part of Crispus showed him that the three\r\nJews, having lowered Vashti, were themselves preparing to descend.\r\n\r\n“Way there!” cried a powerful voice from among the crowd. The throng\r\nparted, and a tall, red-bearded figure, armed with sword and shield,\r\nmounted the lowest stair and began a wary ascent. His example inspired\r\nothers to follow.\r\n\r\nCrispus looked calmly down upon the first of the ascending file.\r\n\r\n“Who art thou?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Ananus, Simon’s chief captain,” was the proud answer.\r\n\r\n“Ah! And are all Simon’s captains as ugly as thou?”\r\n\r\nWith a snarl of rage--for he knew himself to be illfavored, and nothing\r\ntouched his vanity more than to be reminded of the fact--the slayer of\r\nthe last high priest leaped fiercely up the stairs towards Crispus,\r\nwho, at that moment, caught the welcome peal of Asaph’s trumpet.\r\n\r\nThen, to the amazement of the gazing crowd, Crispus, stepping\r\nbackwards, actually sheathed his sword.\r\n\r\nThey saw the reason a moment afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt his feet lay a huge post, similar to those upon which Simon’s\r\ncrucified victims hung. Crispus lifted this long beam in his arms,\r\ncarefully adjusting its balance; and, as soon as Ananus appeared at the\r\ntop of the stairs, he sent the head of this improvised battering-ram\r\nfull tilt into the Zealot’s stomach with so tremendous an impact that\r\nnot only did Ananus fly backwards, gasping and helpless, but in his\r\nfall he also carried with him the rest of the file that were coming up\r\nbehind. The indignant howls of the bruised crew were as music to the\r\nears of Crispus. Dropping the log, he instantly turned and fled, an act\r\nthat naturally made the crowd below dash at once up the stairway in\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\nBut never did Grecian runner skim over the Olympic stadium more fleetly\r\nthan did the Roman Crispus along that wall of Ophel. Ere the foremost\r\nof the Zealots had come tumbling over the top stair, he had reached the\r\nplace where the rope hung, and, pausing for a moment to fling a gesture\r\nof defiance at his pursuers, he swung himself over the battlement, and\r\nmade a rapid hand-over-hand descent to the foot of the ramparts, where\r\nstood the three Jews and the trembling Vashti.\r\n\r\n“Are you hurt?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No, but I warrant Ananus is,” laughed Crispus. “For some days to\r\ncome he’ll have no stomach for the fight. And now, away! See, they are\r\nopening a gate on our left.”\r\n\r\nLifting Vashti--how thin and light she was!--he sped down the slope of\r\nOphel with her, and succeeded in safely reaching the Roman lines.\r\n\r\nDetermined to forestall any attempt on the part of Titus to detain her\r\nhe dispatched Vashti that same hour of the night, under the care of two\r\nChristian soldiers, to the saints that dwelt at Pella.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                               CLOSING IN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long blockade had failed to bring about the surrender of the city;\r\nand Titus was beginning to grow weary of the delay; in fancy he could\r\nhear the patricians of Rome laughing at the plebeian-born general, and\r\ndeclaring that a city taken by famine was not a very brilliant way of\r\ninaugurating the new dynasty of Flavian emperors.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that on the day following Vashti’s departure for\r\nPella, the mighty Roman host at a word from Titus roused itself to toil\r\nagain like a giant refreshed by a long sleep.\r\n\r\nAs the fortress Antonia was the key to the temple, Titus began by\r\nraising opposite this fortress four huge aggeres.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the former banks had cleared all the timber from\r\nthe immediate vicinity of Jerusalem, so that the Romans were compelled\r\nto go farther afield, and at the end of twenty-one days--the time taken\r\nin raising these new aggeres--there was not a tree left within ten\r\nmiles of the city!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, long teams of oxen, bellowing under the lash, were toiling\r\nup the rugged pass of Beth-horon, drawing endless files of wagons roped\r\nto each other, upon which were mounted the new military machines, huge\r\nand terrible, constructed by the Greek engineers of Cæsarea.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-second day, the artillery (this word is long anterior to\r\nthe use of firearms) was placed in position, and the legions, massing\r\nall their strength, directed a fierce attack upon the northern wall of\r\nAntonia, the stronghold of John of Giscala.\r\n\r\nNow this wall happened to stand upon that part which had been\r\nundermined by John at the time when the Romans made their former\r\nattack; and the hollow ground, weakened by the shaking caused by the\r\nbattering-rams, gave way during the first night, hurling down a portion\r\nof the wall with all the sentinels upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, startled from their sleep by the appalling crash and by\r\nthe thrilling shrieks of the doomed victims, knew not at first what\r\nhad happened, but when the morning light revealed the nature of the\r\ndisaster, they grasped their weapons, clambered over the ruins, and\r\npoured through the breach.\r\n\r\nBut Antonia was not yet taken. John, exercising a military foresight\r\nthat moved his enemies to surprise, if not to admiration, had\r\npreviously raised a second wall within.\r\n\r\nAs it was impossible to advance the engines through the breach, the\r\nRomans, in order to overcome this new barrier, were compelled to resort\r\nto other means.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to surmount it by boldly climbing up in the very face of\r\nthe enemy, they lay down at last at the foot of the wall, and, forming\r\na testudo, or roof of shields, they sought to loosen with iron crows\r\nthe lower courses of the masonry, a process attended with little hurt\r\nto the wall, but with considerable loss of life to the Romans.\r\n\r\nNow Crispus, having taken due note that a certain part of this wall\r\ndeclined backwards, and that the stones at this said part projected in\r\nsuch a manner as to afford some slight foothold, resolved to attempt\r\na nocturnal surprise on his own account. At the dead of night he\r\nassembled fifteen of his bravest troops, including a trumpeter and an\r\neagle-bearer.\r\n\r\nCreeping forward with soundless tread, the little band, favored by\r\nthe gloom, gained the foot of the wall unseen by the Jewish sentinels\r\nabove. Then Crispus silently and cautiously began the ascent; his men\r\nfollowed like a file of grim specters. One javelin hurled from above\r\nwould have sufficed to send the whole party thundering down. No such\r\ndisaster occurred, however. Whether the sentinels were sleeping, or\r\nwhether they were keeping careless watch, is a matter that will never\r\nbe known: certain it is that the heroic sixteen safely gained the top\r\nof the wall.\r\n\r\nA whispered word from Crispus, and then on the still night air the\r\ntrumpet rang out the call to arms; long, shrill, and piercing, the\r\nsummons startled the Romans from sleep; it startled still more\r\nthe Jewish sentinels close at hand. Even now it would have been a\r\ncomparatively easy matter to repel the attack; but, as Crispus and his\r\nparty, their lifted blades glinting through the gloom, dashed forward\r\nwith a mighty shout, the Zealot sentinels, without waiting to ascertain\r\nthe number of their assailants, turned tail and fled, fully convinced\r\nthat the whole of the Roman army was pouring over the battlements.\r\n\r\nTheir shouts awoke their fellows. Roused thus in the dead of night the\r\nentire garrison became the victims of one of those panics which have\r\nbeen known to fall sometimes upon even the hardiest veterans. From\r\nabove, from below, from every hall and chamber, there came running\r\nwild-eyed Zealots, whose only object was to save their lives; in mad\r\nconfusion they made for the south side of the fortress, where lay\r\nthe only available exit--a narrow causeway over the deep ravine that\r\nseparated Antonia from the temple.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Titus and the rest of the Romans in the camp, guided by the\r\ncontinuous pealing of the trumpet, hurried forward, scaled the wall,\r\nand found to their surprise and delight that the enemy had vacated the\r\nfortress without striking a blow.\r\n\r\nNow the surrender of Antonia had opened the way to the temple, and\r\nCrispus, thinking in one night and by the same stroke, to capture both\r\nplaces was pursuing the retreating Zealots across the connecting\r\ncauseway.\r\n\r\nBut now the Zealots, cursing themselves for their cowardly folly,\r\nturned and made a stand upon this same causeway.\r\n\r\nThen began a battle, perhaps the fiercest and bloodiest in the whole\r\ncourse of the siege. Spears and javelins being useless, both sides drew\r\ntheir swords and fought it out hand to hand. In the gloom of night the\r\ntroops of both parties were so intermingled that no man knew where he\r\nwas; more often than not Roman slew Roman, and Jew slew Jew. Crispus,\r\nstunned by a blow on the head, was dragged forth from the fray by a\r\nfaithful legionary.\r\n\r\nWith the dawn Simon came to the aid of his Zealot rival; and then\r\nindeed the fighting, and the shouting, and the clangor, grew fiercer\r\nand louder than ever. On that narrow viaduct there was no room either\r\nto advance or retreat; scores of the combatants were forced over the\r\nparapet, and shrieking, fell, to be dashed to pieces in the rocky\r\nravine below. The passage became so crowded with dead that the living\r\nto get at each other were obliged to mount upon piles of bodies and of\r\narmor.\r\n\r\nAt last, when it became clear that the Romans could make no headway,\r\nTitus, after ten hours of this fighting, gave the signal for recall.\r\n\r\nThanks to Crispus, however, the great fortress of Antonia was now\r\nin Roman hands, and as Simon beheld the standard inscribed S.P.Q.R.\r\nfloating proudly again from its lofty battlements, he wept tears\r\nof grief and rage, and cursed John to his face saying--somewhat\r\nunjustly--that none but a fool or a coward or a traitor could have lost\r\nsuch a stronghold.\r\n\r\nLater that same day Rufus and Crispus stood on the battlements of\r\nAntonia; and of all the Romans, who more pleased than Rufus at finding\r\nhimself once more in his old familiar fortress?\r\n\r\nThe two, looking down from their lofty position, watched the\r\npreparations that were being made for the defense of the temple. The\r\nmarble courts and gilded pinnacles were assuming the appearance of a\r\nwarlike citadel. Thousands of Zealots, under the direction of Simon\r\nand John, were hauling their huge military engines over the tesselated\r\npavement, till the northern porticoes facing Antonia fairly bristled\r\nwith balistæ and catapults. The clang of arms and the creaking of the\r\nmachines, the shouting of men and the ceaseless hurrying hither and\r\nthither, made a scene difficult to reconcile with the belief that the\r\nplace was the house of God.\r\n\r\n“What is the day of the month?” asked Rufus, suddenly.\r\n\r\n“The seventeenth of July,” replied Crispus.\r\n\r\n“I venture to prophesy that in the years to come the Jews--if there\r\nbe any of them left after this war--will keep this day as a day of\r\nmourning.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“The answer is to be found _there!_” remarked Rufus, pointing to the\r\ncourt of the priests. “It is the hour of the evening sacrifice,” he\r\ncontinued, glancing at a sun-dial near by, “but where is the smoke\r\nascending from the altar? ’Twas absent, too, this morning, so I am\r\ntold. _The daily sacrifice hath ceased_ for lack of victims. If I\r\nrightly foresee the fate of the temple, they made their last sacrifice\r\nyester even.”\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the pagan Rufus the matter was one of little moment,\r\nbut to Crispus, with his Christian way of thinking, this cessation of\r\na sacrifice that had taken place twice a day for a space of thirteen\r\nhundred years was full of a profound significance; he knew that to the\r\npious Hebrew, if not to the fighting Zealot, it must appear an event as\r\ngrave almost as a stoppage in the progress of the universe, for had not\r\nthe scribes said, “The world was made for the sake of the temple,” and\r\nwhat was the temple without its sacrifices?\r\n\r\nTitus, made aware of the event, sought to conciliate the religious\r\nsentiment of the foe by a very remarkable offer.\r\n\r\nJosephus, covered by the shield of a legionary, walked along the\r\ncauseway; and, halting in the middle, lifted up his voice, and\r\naddressed the Jewish people in the Hebrew tongue.\r\n\r\n“Simon Bar-gioras and John of Giscala, hear now the words of Titus\r\nCæsar. He hath a reverence for your temple, and would fain save it from\r\nthe destruction which ye, by converting it into a citadel, are bringing\r\nupon it. If ye will remove your men of war, he will meet you in battle\r\nat Mount Zion or in whatever place you choose; he, too, will withdraw\r\nhis arms from the temple, leaving it sacred and inviolate. And as a\r\ntoken of his good will towards you, he offers you this day a gift of\r\nthreescore rams that ye may continue the daily sacrifice as heretofore.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! mark you that?” said Rufus to Crispus. “There speaks not Titus but\r\nBerenice.”\r\n\r\nThere were among the Jewish people thousands that would gladly have\r\nseen the war removed from the temple and its precincts, but they were\r\noverawed by the Zealots, who, by the mouth of Simon, thus made answer:\r\n\r\n“Titus, knowing that he cannot take the temple by force of arms,\r\nwhereof the fight of this morning is a witness, speaks thus, hoping\r\nto lure us from our stronghold, that he may the more easily enter it.\r\nBut in vain is the net spread in the sight of the bird. His threescore\r\nrams we will not take, for never shall it be said that the sacrifices\r\nto the Eternal One have become dependent upon the polluted offerings\r\nof an uncircumcized heathen. And to him and to the whole Roman empire\r\ndo we offer an everlasting defiance. Now, renegade, carry back in thy\r\ndetestable Greek or Latin the answer of Simon Bar-gioras.”\r\n\r\nThis haughty reply, and especially its boastful note as to the fight on\r\nthe causeway, so provoked Titus that he determined to make a second\r\nattempt that very night. As the whole army were unable to join in the\r\nassault owing to the narrowness of the approach, there were picked out\r\nfrom each century the thirty bravest and strongest men; tribunes were\r\nappointed over each thousand, and one Cerealis, an officer of rare\r\nvalor, was chosen to command the whole. In the great hall of Antonia\r\nthe storming party consecrated themselves, as it were, to the work by\r\noffering, under the presidency of Theomantes, a solemn sacrifice to\r\nMars.\r\n\r\nAn hour before dawn Cerealis at the head of his men, advanced over the\r\ncauseway with swift silent tread, but failed to effect a surprise.\r\nSimon, if not John, was on the alert. Then began a battle similar in\r\nall respects to that of the preceding night. After eight hours of\r\ndesperate fighting the Romans had not gained a foot of ground, and the\r\nbattle ceased, as it were, by mutual consent.\r\n\r\nNow no more could the Romans boast that, man for man, they were\r\nsuperior to the Jews, when the picked soldiers of their army, the very\r\nflower of the legions, had suffered repulse at the hands of the Zealots.\r\n\r\nThe iron warriors, who had carried their eagles triumphantly over\r\nall nations from the Euphrates to the Atlantic, leaned moodily upon\r\ntheir spears, and stared up with dark and sullen faces at the laughing\r\nZealots, who, clustering upon the roof of the northern cloisters,\r\npointed with their swords at the causeway and mockingly asked the foe\r\nwhy they did not come into the temple.\r\n\r\n“Give counsel what we shall do,” said Titus to Tiberius Alexander.\r\n\r\n“Raze Antonia to the ground, and with the materials fill up this\r\nintervening glen so as to make a broad level way, over which we may\r\nhaul our engines to batter the northern cloisters.”\r\n\r\nTitus without delay adopted this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe Roman soldiers, burning to retrieve their tarnished honor, had\r\nno sooner received the new command than they flew with ardor to\r\nits execution. All along the sky-line, on every tower, turret and\r\nbattlement, were seen groups of men furnished with lever and crow, by\r\nwhose means blocks of masonry were lifted up to be sent whirling and\r\ncrashing into the valley below; far into the night the soldiers toiled\r\nby the ruddy glare of a thousand torches, and as the mighty fortress\r\nsank lower and lower so did the débris accumulated in the valley rise\r\nhigher and higher.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots no longer mocked, but looked on in silent wonder at this\r\ndisplay of almost superhuman energy. There was something sublime in\r\nthis demolition of a magnificent citadel merely for the purpose of\r\nfilling up a trench.\r\n\r\nAt last a broad and level way was successfully carried across the\r\nravine right up to the very foot of the northern cloisters.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day that saw its completion Crispus, walking\r\nmeditatively upon the crest of Olivet, came suddenly upon a figure\r\nstanding solitary, silent, motionless. It was the woman who was\r\nsteadfastly refusing to acknowledge herself as his wife, the Princess\r\nBerenice. Not far off, in the background, stood two attendants with a\r\nchariot. Evidently she had come to take a look, perhaps her last look,\r\nat her native city.\r\n\r\nCrispus had leisure to observe her, for she was so wrapped in\r\ncontemplation that she did not hear his tread.\r\n\r\nHer face was pale, and anguish looked from her eyes as she surveyed the\r\nruin wrought by man against his fellow-man.\r\n\r\nThe country, swept of all its timber to supply materials for the Roman\r\nbanks and for camp fires, had lost all its sylvan charm and beauty.\r\n\r\nTo this denudation must be added the ravages of the Arabian and Syrian\r\nallies, who, haters of the Jews, had diffused their devastating\r\nfrenzy so far around that, from the summit of Olivet, neither village\r\nnor house, neither tower nor wall, could be seen to break the dreary\r\nmonotony of the landscape. So mournful a change had passed over the\r\ncountry that in the striking language of Josephus, “_Anyone that had\r\npreviously known the place, coming on a sudden to it now, would have\r\nfailed to recognize it!_”\r\n\r\nIt was a scene of utter desolation, a howling wilderness, made more\r\nawful by the light of the setting sun, which, half sunk below the\r\nhorizon, shot a sinister red glare athwart the melancholy waste.\r\n\r\nIn all the wide extent of landscape there was no vestige of life or\r\nmovement, save at one spot only, where the grim and ever-narrowing\r\ncircle of fire and steel was slowly extinguishing the life of a once\r\ngreat nation.\r\n\r\nBerenice set her eyes upon the city, or rather upon what was left of\r\nit. Was this the place that the Psalmist had called, “The joy of the\r\nwhole earth”?\r\n\r\nGone was the suburb of Bezetha! Gone was the suburb of Acra! Gone\r\nwas the citadel of Antonia! Zion and Ophel remained, but woefully\r\nwrecked and dilapidated; and the temple--shorn, alas! of its divine\r\nsacrifies--still rose as fair as ever, its marble porticoes and golden\r\npinnacles dyed in the blood-red hues of sunset. But how long would\r\nit stand? Ah! there was her fear, and she pressed her hand to her\r\nthrobbing heart.\r\n\r\nTurning suddenly she caught sight of Crispus, and started. There was\r\na proud trembling of her lip as if she were trying to subdue some\r\nemotion--anger probably--that was rising to the surface.\r\n\r\n“So it was _you_,” said she, taking no notice of his greeting, “who\r\nprevented my weekly gift of rams from reaching the temple?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, it was Tiberius Alexander, though I freely admit that his deed\r\nhas my approval.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“The Law, princess, was but a shadow of things to come. There is\r\nnow no need for typical sacrifices when the True Sacrifice has been\r\noffered, once and for all. And since the Jew refuses to acknowledge the\r\ntemporal character of the Law, there is but one way of teaching him the\r\nlesson--a stern and terrible way!”\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether Berenice, not being versed in Pauline theology,\r\nquite comprehended the import of these words; at any rate, she did not\r\nreply to them.\r\n\r\n“They tell me you are great at slaughter,” she said, with a sort of\r\nsneer, “and that, as being the first to mount the battlements of\r\nAntonia, you have gained a Mural Crown. And now, grown more bold, you\r\nseek to take God himself captive.”\r\n\r\n“Princess, you talk as do the heathen. The Most High dwelleth not in\r\ntemples made with hands.”\r\n\r\n“Yet your master Paul was wont to worship in yon edifice.”\r\n\r\n“I doubt whether he would do so to-day, were he living, seeing that\r\nthere is now no holiness in yon temple. The spirit of true religion\r\nhas fled from the place. The high priest Phannias is a village rustic,\r\nunlawfully chosen by lot, so ignorant that he knows not how to perform\r\nthe duties of his office. The temple has become a slaughter-house,\r\nreeking with innocent blood shed by the wicked Zealots, who have held\r\ntherein mock trials of the rich, condemning them to death that they\r\nmay seize upon their wealth. The place is no longer a temple but a\r\ncitadel. The holy vessels have been melted down to form instruments\r\nof war. Assassins pile their arms around the altar, and revelers make\r\nthemselves drunk in the Sanctuary. It were a shame to speak of the\r\nthings that have been done there. John’s men, tricked out in feminine\r\ngarb, have imitated the infamies of the guilty Cities of the Plain. And\r\nyou would bid us deal tenderly with this place, forsooth! Nay, verily,\r\nits stones cry out for the avenging, purifying fire of heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Or the flaming torch of Crispus,” sneered Berenice. “You think to see\r\nthe temple destroyed, but it shall not be so. Titus has pledged me his\r\nsolemn word to preserve it.”\r\n\r\n“Titus may promise what he will; he cannot overturn the counsels of the\r\nMost High.”\r\n\r\n“Whose instrument you deem yourself to be,” returned Berenice,\r\ndisdainfully. “I know the secret thought of your heart. A vision sent,\r\nnot as you vainly think by God, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the\r\ndevils, is luring you on to a wicked deed. You have desired to take\r\npart in the siege for this end only, that when the attack on the temple\r\nshall begin you may be able in the confusion to apply an incendiary\r\ntorch. Do so, and the act shall bring death upon her whom you hold most\r\ndear.”\r\n\r\n“And who is that?” asked Crispus quickly.\r\n\r\n“Vashti, who, instead of being safe at Pella, as you intended her to\r\nbe, is a captive at my mercy--my slave to do with as I list. Your act\r\nin bringing her forth from Jerusalem has had this result only--to\r\ndeliver her into my hands the sooner.”\r\n\r\nThough Crispus tried to receive this startling news with outward\r\ncalmness, something of the fear felt by him looked from his eyes, and\r\ndrew a triumphant smile from Berenice.\r\n\r\nMistress of Vashti, she was mistress of his action, so she thought, and\r\nhis action must be the sparing of the temple.\r\n\r\n“It was by accident I discovered that your Vashti was at Pella. Armed\r\nwith the written authority granted me by Titus I immediately arrested\r\nmy slave, and conveyed her to--to----”--No! she would keep the name\r\nof the place a secret--“to where you will not find her. Now, mark my\r\nwords, Crispus Cestius Gallus. If by your hand yon temple burns, so too\r\nshall Vashti burn; she shall die, shrieking in a flaming vesture of\r\npitch, even as the Christians died in the gardens of Nero.”\r\n\r\n“Princess, if yours be the heart of a woman, I am glad to possess the\r\nheart of a man.”\r\n\r\nBerenice laughed, a cold, hard laugh.\r\n\r\n“I care not how vile I be in your sight so long as I can but save the\r\ntemple. Retire this night from the army--Titus will permit it--have no\r\nmore to do with the siege, and I will set Vashti at liberty. What is\r\nyour answer?”\r\n\r\n“This. Your threat supplies an additional argument for the destruction\r\nof the temple, since it is clear that its dead ritual and external\r\nformalities have no power to purify the heart or quicken the\r\nconscience. As to your menace against Vashti, forget not that it is\r\nwritten, ‘Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed.’”\r\n\r\nBerenice laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\n“Who will venture to punish a princess and the friend of Titus merely\r\nfor putting her own slave to death?”\r\n\r\n“The Christians.”\r\n\r\n“The Christians!” repeated Berenice, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n“I have said it, princess. If Vashti dies, you die also. Trust not to\r\nthe power of Titus to save you. There are in yon army Christians who,\r\nin the execution of what they deem to be right, fear neither kings nor\r\nCæsars. You shall be secretly seized and carried off to a conclave of\r\nChristians there to be judged of the deed by your own Law, which has\r\nsaid: ‘Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, burning for burning’; Berenice’s\r\ndeath for Vashti’s death. If you are found guilty, be sure of this,\r\nprincess, _they’ll not lack an executioner_!”\r\n\r\nAs Berenice beheld the set, stern look on his face, she had no need to\r\nask who that executioner would be.\r\n\r\nWithout another word he turned and left her.\r\n\r\nShe had sought to frighten him, but it was _she_ who was the\r\nfrightened one. She stood in fear and trembling, knowing that her\r\nthreat instead of acting as a deterrent had but made him the more\r\nresolved to carry out his purpose.\r\n\r\nNext day the toiling legions pushing forward their military engines\r\ndirected a fierce attack along the line of cloisters--more than a\r\nthousand feet in length--that formed the northern side of the great\r\ntemple-platform.\r\n\r\nNow that the battle had reached the very seat of their religion the\r\nJews fought with a fury they had never before shown; the priests\r\nthemselves were under arms, rivaling the Zealots in deeds of valor;\r\nSimon, with bare arm and flashing scimitar, was seen at every point\r\nalong the line, urging on to fresh exertions men who required but\r\nlittle urging.\r\n\r\nLet Jewish valor do what it would, however, it could not prevail; each\r\nday marked an advance on the part of the Romans, who at last became\r\nmasters of the whole northern gallery, which they proceeded at once to\r\ndestroy by fire, ax, and crow, in order to facilitate the advance of\r\nthe battering-train.\r\n\r\nThe victors had now gained the summit of the lofty temple-platform, a\r\nvast square open to the sky save at the sides which were adorned with\r\ncloisters. In the midst of this square towered the Sanctuary or temple\r\nproper, a structure 360 feet in length and 270 in breadth. Its exterior\r\nwall, formed of gigantic blocks of marble, and nearly 40 feet in\r\nheight, was pierced by nine gateways, there being three upon each side\r\nsave the western, that side being without gates.\r\n\r\nIt was within this fortress--for such it was--that the defeated Jews\r\nhad taken refuge, and here they prepared to make their final, and, as\r\nthey believed, triumphal stand.\r\n\r\nStrange and incredible fact!\r\n\r\nIn spite of their numerous defeats, hope was stronger than ever in the\r\nbreast of the Jews, who still dreamed of seeing the scepter of empire\r\ntransferred from the Capitol to Zion. They were fully convinced that\r\nthe temple which God Himself had ordered to be built could never be\r\ntrodden by the foot of pagan conqueror. The deity would be certain to\r\nwork a miracle in their favor; at the least, something would happen to\r\nastonish and disperse the enemy. And they talked of Sennacherib and the\r\nburning simoon, but forgot Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\nAnd now the sacred precincts of the temple echoed with the clang of\r\nhorse-hoofs. Roman cavalry clattered on the marble pavement of the\r\nCourt of the Gentiles, and with leveled spears swept round and round\r\nthe Sanctuary, driving in every sortie made from the gates, and acting\r\nas a cover to the Roman infantry, who, with tremendous toil and\r\ndifficulty, were hauling along a train of battering-rams.\r\n\r\nThe Sanctuary was surrounded by a low balustrade, bearing tablets--one\r\nhas survived to the present time--inscribed in Greek and Latin letters\r\nwith notices prohibiting the Gentiles on pain of death from entering\r\nthe edifice--notices that evoked the mocking laughter of the Roman\r\nsoldiery as they set their engines in array against the building.\r\n\r\nThe “middle wall of partition,” which the Law had set up betwixt Jew\r\nand Gentile, was now breaking down in no figurative sense!\r\n\r\nThe temple-platform had a circuit so ample as to contain within it\r\na synagogue, and it was from the roof of this structure, as from\r\na throne, that Titus directed the military operations against the\r\nSanctuary.\r\n\r\nIt was not without an expectant thrill that the Jews awaited Titus’\r\nsignal for the assault, there being a half belief among them that fire\r\nfrom heaven would descend upon the impious band that first ventured\r\nto swing a beam against the sacred wall of God’s house; and therefore\r\nsomething like a sigh of disappointment went up when nothing marvelous\r\nfollowed upon the first stroke of the ram.\r\n\r\nRelying upon the strength of the masonry the Jews did little fighting,\r\ncontent to watch amid laughter and gibes the futile labors of the enemy.\r\n\r\nFor six days the battering-rams swung, and thundered, and pounded\r\nagainst the walls of the Sanctuary; yet not a stone was pushed from its\r\nplace, so marvelously compacted was the masonry.\r\n\r\n“Bring scaling-ladders and storm the walls!” cried Titus on the seventh\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe legionaries, relinquishing the battering-rams, flew to execute this\r\nnew order.\r\n\r\nThe Jews made no resistance to the Romans while mounting, but as soon\r\nas each man had reached the top, they either hurled him down headlong\r\nor slew him before he had time to cover himself with his shield.\r\n\r\nNow here, and now there, a ladder crowded with ascending legionaries,\r\nwould be toppled backwards and the men dashed to pieces upon the marble\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nThe fierce shouts of the active combatants intermingled with the cries\r\nand groans of the wounded and the dying.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours of this deadly game there came a lull. Despairing of\r\ntaking the place by escalade the Romans withdrew to a distance, and\r\nstared up in moody silence at the Zealots, who, brandishing their\r\nweapons, shouted, “Ye cannot take this place; it is the abode of God.”\r\n\r\nThe superstitious legionaries were beginning to think the same. They\r\nno longer laughed at the words, “Let no Gentile enter here on pain\r\nof death.” The dead and dying strewn around on the pavement were a\r\nsignificant commentary on that interdict.\r\n\r\nVainly did the trumpets peal out a call to renew the charge. Not a man\r\nwould move.\r\n\r\nTitus sought to stimulate their courage by a new expedient. Pointing to\r\nthat part of the wall where stood the Zealot chief, he shouted:\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand gold pieces to the man who brings me Simon’s head.”\r\n\r\nNo one seemed willing to earn this rich reward.\r\n\r\nSimon laughed.\r\n\r\n“Titus knows my value. Now to him who brings me the head of Titus I\r\nshall give ten shekels only, it not being worth more.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a standard-bearer, darting forward, mounted a ladder, and when\r\nthree-fourths of the way up, he deliberately flung the eagle into the\r\nmidst of the foe, crying as he waved his sword, “Romans, will you see\r\nyour standard taken by the enemy? Follow me.”\r\n\r\nLose an eagle? Never!\r\n\r\nAmid a wild, shrill clangor of trumpets, the legionaries, with the\r\nflame of battle in their blood, swept forward, wave upon wave,\r\ndetermined this time to carry the fortress. But, alas! for them, this\r\nattack fared no better than the others. The bold standard-bearer was\r\nstruck down; those following him were either slain or repulsed; and the\r\neagle remained in the hands of the foe.\r\n\r\nSimon viewed the idolatrous image with loathing.\r\n\r\n“An abomination brought into the place where it ought not to be,” said\r\nhe. “Bring ax and hammer.”\r\n\r\nAnd with his own strong arm he hewed the golden eagle to pieces, and\r\ncast them down at the feet of the Romans contemptuously, crying:\r\n“Behold your god!”\r\n\r\nIf a yell could have brought down the walls of the Sanctuary they\r\nwould most assuredly have fallen at that moment before the terrific\r\nyell of concentrated hatred and fury that burst from the Romans, when\r\nthey beheld the destruction of what was to them not merely a patriotic\r\nemblem but a darling object of worship, a worship far more real and\r\nfervent than they ever paid to Jove or Mars!\r\n\r\nSimon’s studied affront goaded Titus to a course from which he had\r\nhitherto refrained.\r\n\r\n“_Fire the gates!_” he cried.\r\n\r\nTo this command the legionaries responded with a huge roar of delight.\r\nVast quantities of timber were quickly brought and piled high against\r\nthe metal-plated doors of the nine gateways.\r\n\r\nOf these, the most splendid was the one facing the east, and known as\r\nthe Corinthian Gate, for, whereas, the other doors were crusted all\r\nover with gold and silver, the eastern door was a marvel of richly\r\nchased Corinthian bronze.\r\n\r\nIt was Alexander, the wealthy Alabarch of Alexandria, who had adorned\r\nthe gate in this fashion; and, by a singular turn of destiny, it\r\nwas his apostate son Tiberius who wrought its destruction--a deed\r\nsurprising to the Romans themselves, who could not but regard it as\r\nan act of filial impiety. With buckler held over his head to protect\r\nhimself from the arrows that came whizzing obliquely from above, the\r\nex-procurator of Judæa ascended the stately flight of fifteen stairs,\r\nand, with his own hand, applied a lighted torch to the pile of timber.\r\n\r\nNine huge fires were now smoking, and crackling, and flaming, and\r\nroaring, at the nine gates of the temple. As the metallic platings\r\nbecame red-hot the fire, carried to the woodwork behind, began to\r\nconsume the entire gate.\r\n\r\nThe sight produced a strange and stupefying effect upon the Jews, who\r\nhad never thought such an event to be possible; at one stroke their\r\ncourage seemed to vanish; they made no attempt to quench the flames,\r\nbut stood mute spectators of the scene.\r\n\r\nIt was Titus himself, who, not wishing the conflagration to extend too\r\nfar, gave orders to fling water upon the burning gates; and when this\r\nhad been done, the besieged realized that their defense was all but at\r\nan end; the charred timber of the doors would yield at the first stroke\r\nof the battering-ram, and the enemy would enter by nine different ways.\r\n\r\n“The day is far spent and the soldiers are faint,” said Titus. “We will\r\ndefer our final attack till the morrow.”\r\n\r\nWith a view of cutting off the retreat of Simon and John, who might\r\nseek during the night to make their escape to Mount Zion, Titus caused\r\na great part of his army to camp round about in the cloisters of the\r\nCourt of the Gentiles.\r\n\r\nLeaving Crispus and Rufus in charge of these forces Titus retired\r\nto Antonia, or rather to a corner of it that had been spared in the\r\ngeneral demolition in order to furnish a lodging for himself and his\r\nchief officers.\r\n\r\nAnd here, that same night, there sat that memorable council, assembled\r\nto decide the great question (as if it were in _their_ power to\r\ndecide!) whether the Jewish temple should be preserved or destroyed.\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander was the first to speak; more pagan than the pagans\r\nthemselves he brought forward several reasons, all tending to show that\r\nthe existence of the temple was a menace to the safety of the empire.\r\nHe ended with a religious argument:\r\n\r\n“If you spare this edifice, O Cæsar, the Jews will boast that their God\r\nhas put His fear in your heart and that you dare not destroy it. They\r\nwill see in your leniency both a proof of the divine origin of their\r\ntemple and an augury of its eternal existence; its preservation will\r\nmore than ever convince them that they are the favorites of heaven, and\r\nare therefore under no obligation to obey an earthly power.\r\n\r\n“It must be ours to show that Jupiter of the Capitol is supreme over\r\nJehovah of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n“Two superstitions, equally fatal to the empire, depend for their\r\nexistence upon yon temple, that of the Jews and that of the\r\nChristians![32] These two superstitions, although contrary to each\r\nother, have the same origin: the Christians come from the Jews; destroy\r\nthe root, and the shoot will quickly perish. Wherefore,” concluded he,\r\nwith reminiscences of the psalms, “my counsel is, ‘Down with it; down\r\nwith it, even to the ground!’”\r\n\r\nBut Titus, secretly moved by his infatuation for Berenice, was, of\r\ncourse, disposed to take a milder view.\r\n\r\n“We ought not,” said he, “from hatred of our enemies to take revenge\r\nupon inanimate things. To burn so vast and splendid a fabric is to do\r\nhurt to ourselves, seeing that it is an ornament to our empire.”[33]\r\n\r\nAnd, perceiving on which side of the question the mind of their general\r\nlay a certain minority, who had been disposed to favor the views of\r\nAlexander, dropped their opposition.\r\n\r\n“This, then, is our decree,” said Titus solemnly, “and let the whole\r\narmy know it--the temple shall be preserved.”\r\n\r\nHe that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in\r\nderision!\r\n\r\nFor scarcely had Titus made an end of speaking when from without\r\nthere came a cry, distant and faint; it was repeated in a louder key;\r\ncaught up by a thousand tongues, alike by the startled Romans in the\r\ncamp and by the terrified Jews in the city, the wild tidings came\r\nrolling louder, and ever louder, upon the night air, to the mockery and\r\nconfusion of the military council:\r\n\r\n=“THE TEMPLE IS ON FIRE!”=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                     “WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?”\r\n\r\n\r\nNight, still and beautiful, rested upon the temple-courts; in the\r\nimmeasurable depths of a purple sky the stars were burning with the\r\nbrilliancy peculiar to southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe battle-toil of the day had given place to a strange quiet; both\r\nsides seemed bent on taking rest as a preparation for the greater\r\nstruggle of the morrow.\r\n\r\nNo sound came from the Sanctuary; its unseen sentinels moved with\r\nsilent tread.\r\n\r\nWithin the circumjacent cloisters, and hidden by the shadows, lay the\r\nRoman troops, sleeping on their arms, yet ready at the first blast of\r\nthe trumpet to spring into life and action.\r\n\r\nCrispus and Rufus paced softly to and fro over the pavement of the\r\nCourt of the Gentiles, seldom, if ever, removing their eyes from the\r\nSanctuary, lest a sudden rush on the part of the enemy should take\r\ntheir troops by surprise.\r\n\r\nCrispus was thinking of the fate of the Roman Capitol which, nine\r\nmonths previously, in the civil war between the Vespasians and the\r\nVitellians, had been destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nNow the Capitol was the temple of sovereign Jupiter, and hence its fall\r\nhad sent a profound sensation through the pagan world. It would be a\r\nfact more significant still, if, within the same year and by similar\r\nmeans, the great Jewish temple should fall. To minds intent on studying\r\nthe signs of the times, the two events would seem as if foreshadowing\r\nthe doom of two religions, that of heathendom, and that of Jewry.\r\n\r\nAnd doomed they were! They had played their preparatory part in the\r\nhistory of human progress, and were now to give place to a loftier and\r\nmore spiritual faith.\r\n\r\n“Titus holds high council to-night,” remarked Rufus, suddenly breaking\r\nin upon Crispus’ thoughts. “He is for preserving the temple. Every\r\nman knows why. He is moved by love for the new Cleopatra. She and her\r\nbrother Agrippa visited his quarters yesterday, and remained there for\r\nsome time. We can guess what their talk was about. Now if this temple\r\nbe permitted to stand, we shall continue to have the annual gatherings\r\nof treasonable Jews breathing defiance to Roman rule. The result will\r\nbe another war, and we shall have all our work over again. And what a\r\nwork it has been! Was there ever in all history a siege like this?”\r\n\r\n“And it is by no means over yet,” commented Crispus. “All our previous\r\nwork will appear but as child’s play when we come to deal with the\r\ntaking of Zion.”\r\n\r\n“My fear, too,” responded Rufus moodily. “This stubborn people,\r\nrefusing to see that they are beaten, will go on fighting to the end.\r\nBut as to this temple, my opinion is that since the Jews choose to\r\nturn it into a fortress it should be treated as such, and razed to the\r\nground. If I were Titus,” he added emphatically, “I would destroy both\r\ncity and temple, exclude all Jews from Judæa, and colonize it with\r\nRomans. Thus only shall we have peace.”\r\n\r\nCrispus fell into a reverie.\r\n\r\nHe had, when a pagan, seen reasons to wish the temple at an end, and\r\nnow, as a Christian, he could add to his reasons.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that he argued within himself.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the temple was a perpetual affront to the living\r\nChrist, since its daily sacrifices were a tacit denial of the great\r\nfact that the True Sacrifice had been offered once and for all. With\r\nthe death of Christ Judaism had come to an end, but what Jew would\r\never believe this until he saw that the God who had ordered the temple\r\nto be built now permitted it to be destroyed? Add to this, that the\r\nsure word of prophecy had said that the Messiah would come while the\r\nSecond Temple was standing; if this--the Second Temple--should fall, it\r\nwould be a proof to the Jewish nation that the Messiah _had_ come--and\r\ngone!--and that those were wrong who looked for Him in the future.\r\n\r\nAnother point worth noting: so long as the temple stood--that temple in\r\nwhich the apostles themselves were wont to meet for worship--so long\r\nwould there be on the part of Christianity a temptation to revert to\r\nthe precepts and rites of the Law. As a matter of fact, in spite of\r\nall the writings and labors of Saint Paul to the contrary, a hybrid\r\nbelief, a Christianized form of Judaism, the heresy called at a later\r\nday Ebionism, was already in existence, threatening the purity of the\r\nChurch’s faith. The development of Christianity required that it should\r\nbe freed from the bondage of the Law, and how could that freedom be\r\nmore effectively attained than by the fall of the edifice, which was,\r\nas it were, the actual embodiment of that Law?\r\n\r\nMoreover, had not the Saviour said that some of His own generation\r\nshould not taste of death till they had seen the fall of the temple?\r\nForty years had now passed since that utterance. If its fall were\r\ndelayed much longer, would not the Saviour appear as a false prophet?\r\nBut, unless a miracle were going to happen, must not the destruction of\r\nthe temple be brought about by human instrumentality? Why not by his\r\nown? Was it impious to imagine that he was the agent foreordained to\r\ncarry out the Divine purpose?\r\n\r\nHe thought of the vision of the flaming torch, and of the Divine voice,\r\ncrying, “_Burn!_” and he doubted no longer.\r\n\r\nRufus put the finishing touch to his determination by a significant\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n“Now if Titus could be persuaded to destroy the temple, to-day would be\r\nan appropriate date for it.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“By the Jewish calendar to-day is the ninth of the month Ab. On this\r\nvery day exactly 658 years ago the Chaldeans burnt the first temple.”\r\n\r\nThe very date seemed to be inviting him to the deed!\r\n\r\nScarcely had this thought passed through his mind when Rufus exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Ah! what light is that? By the gods, a sortie!”\r\n\r\nHis remark was caused by the sight of an immense body of Jews, who,\r\nhaving opened one of the half-burned gates, were issuing noiselessly\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThey were seen, however, not only by Crispus and Rufus, but by the\r\nvigilant Roman sentinels. Instantly, the shrill trumpet blast rang out\r\nthe call to arms, and the legionaries, starting from sleep, grasped\r\ntheir weapons and stood ready for the conflict.\r\n\r\nHeedless of the fact that they were discovered the Jews poured down\r\nthe steps of the gateway and raced across the court towards the wooden\r\nsynagogue, from whose roof Titus had directed his operations against\r\nthe Sanctuary. They ran amid a blaze of light cast by torches, the\r\nobject of the Jews being evidently to fire the synagogue in the hope of\r\nburning such of the enemy as lay sleeping within.\r\n\r\nThey failed in their purpose, however. Both from the nearer synagogue\r\nitself and from the more distant cloisters, the Romans poured forth\r\nwith clanging buckler and flashing broadsword; a desperate hand-to-hand\r\ncombat took place, lasting for a brief space only, inasmuch as the\r\nZealots, seeing the number of their foes increasing moment by\r\nmoment, turned tail and fled, pursued by the shouting, triumphant\r\nlegionaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moved by a Divine impulse]\r\n\r\nCrispus and Rufus, who had taken an active part in the fray, joined\r\nalso in the pursuit.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, while Rufus ran on, Crispus stopped, attracted by the sight\r\nof a flaming torch dropped probably by a flying Zealot. Moved by some\r\nunaccountable prompting he picked it up, and as he did so he caught\r\nsight of something above that sent a strange thrill through him; all\r\nunconsciously he had checked his footsteps beneath the golden window of\r\nthe room Gazith, that judgment-hall in which the Saviour of the world\r\nhad received His sentence of condemnation at the mouth of the Sanhedrim.\r\n\r\nSomething light and cool stirred the hair of Crispus; it was a faint\r\nwind coming from the north, the very direction required to carry the\r\nflames throughout the building!\r\n\r\nLet others regard these things as mere coincidences; to Crispus they\r\nwere signs that the hour, long predestined, had come.\r\n\r\n“Marcus,” said he, stopping one of his own soldiers who was running\r\npast at that moment, “lift me up to yon window.”\r\n\r\nWithout a word the man clasping his tribune’s ankles, reared him aloft,\r\nand set his feet upon his own shoulders.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Crispus hesitated; then, as the historian of the event\r\ntestifies, “MOVED BY A DIVINE IMPULSE,” he thrust the flambeau through\r\nthe golden lattices, and, having effectively kindled the woodwork of\r\nthe interior, sprang to the ground again.\r\n\r\nSo little time had he taken that it was doubtful whether any other\r\nRoman besides Marcus had witnessed his act; certain it was that none of\r\nthe Zealots suspected that there was kindling a fire whose flames were\r\ndestined to sweep the temple from end to end.\r\n\r\nCrispus glanced at the gate from which the Zealots had issued but\r\na few minutes previously; having retreated to it they were now\r\nendeavoring with might and main to stay the entering of the Romans.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes again to the golden window, and laughed to see that\r\nthe light within was increasing in brightness; the whole room must soon\r\nbe in a blaze, and the hall that had once reverberated with the unjust\r\ncry, “He is guilty of death,” would be the first of the temple-chambers\r\nto perish.\r\n\r\nAs yet no one either within or without the building seemed to be aware\r\nof what was going on; so much the better! the fire would gain such a\r\nhold that human efforts must fail to extinguish it.\r\n\r\nThe room above the hall Gazith was now burning, burning with a hidden\r\nglow. Then, all in a moment, with a snap and a crackle, there leaped\r\nskywards a dazzling sheet of flame accompanied by a wave of black smoke\r\nand a fierce shower of red sparks that, carried by the northern wind,\r\nswept southwards over the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\nThat startling glare, lighting up the dusk of night with the sudden\r\nbrightness of noontide, caused the fighting at the gate to cease for a\r\nmoment; Roman and Zealot alike turned their eyes to ascertain the cause.\r\n\r\nA moment afterwards there ran through the length and breadth of the\r\nSanctuary one thrilling simultaneous shout:\r\n\r\n“_The temple is on fire!_”\r\n\r\nBy this time the whole Roman force that had lain within the cloisters\r\nhad gathered round the Sanctuary. Their feeling was one of dismay, for\r\nthe fire was destroying their hopes of plunder. Behind those walls\r\nthere lay stores of wealth greater far than were ever contained in\r\nthe palace of the Cæsars; the gold and silver utensils used in the\r\nsacrifices; the rich offerings--accumulations of centuries--made by\r\npious Jews throughout the world; the jeweled vestments of the priests;\r\nthe hoards of costly spices; the countless shekels plundered from the\r\ncitizens by the Zealots.\r\n\r\nFor several days previously the Roman soldiery had talked of little\r\nelse but the temple-treasures with which they were hoping to enrich\r\nthemselves as a recompense after their many weeks of toil.\r\n\r\nAnd now must they lose their reward?\r\n\r\nIf they should wait till the morning, the time fixed by Titus for the\r\nfinal assault upon the Sanctuary, the riches would be consumed. Why\r\ntarry?\r\n\r\nA moment they stood, irresolute, murmuring; then, with a simultaneous\r\nshout, “On to the gold of the temple!” each soldier firmly grasping\r\nblade and shield, and disregarding the remonstrations of his officer,\r\nrushed forward to whichever gate of the nine happened to be nearest.\r\n\r\nThe Zealots, massed in dense bodies at each entrance, fought with\r\nfanatical fury, animated by no other desire than that of revenging\r\nthemselves upon their enemies and of perishing amid the blazing ruins\r\nof the temple.\r\n\r\nThose Romans who attacked the great Corinthian Gate were the first to\r\nfight their way in. Headed by Terentius Rufus, who, finding himself\r\nunable to check his men, determined to lead them, they entered the\r\nquadrangle known as the Court of the Women, so called because thus far\r\nwomen might enter to worship, but not farther.\r\n\r\nThis court contained, among other things, the twelve chests with\r\nfunnel-shaped openings into which pious Jews were wont to drop their\r\nfree-will offerings.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the Romans were breaking open these treasury boxes and\r\nothers were dispersing into the chambers around in search of plunder,\r\na third and more numerous party, led by Rufus, continued the fight,\r\ndriving the Zealots before them across the Court of the Women, and up\r\nthe semicircular ascent of twelve stairs that fronted the great brazen\r\ngate of Nicanor, which led to the inner court, or Court of Israel.\r\nTwining around the sides and above the entablature of this entrance\r\nwas an object attractive to the eyes of plunderers--the celebrated vine\r\nwhose branches, leaves, and grape-clusters were all of pure gold.\r\n\r\n“Close the gate!” shouted Simon.\r\n\r\nVain the command!\r\n\r\nLike some moving wall of bronze, buckler touching buckler, the front\r\nrank of the legionaries pushed its way forward inch by inch up the\r\nstairs and into the interior court.\r\n\r\n“Way there for Cæsar!” shouted Rufus as, standing on the topmost of the\r\ntwelve stairs, he caught sight of Titus, who, surrounded by his chief\r\nofficers, was seeking to clear a path through the throng of surging,\r\nshouting Romans.\r\n\r\nConsternation was written on the face of Titus. Though not troubling to\r\ncommunicate the fact to his council, he had pledged his word both to\r\nBerenice and to Agrippa that the temple should be preserved; and now,\r\nto his confusion, there was fast spreading along the northern cloister\r\nof the Sanctuary a fire that, unless immediately checked, would consume\r\nthe whole edifice.\r\n\r\nMany of the soldiers, possessed by the frenzy for destruction that is\r\napt to come upon man at such wild times, were helping to spread the\r\nconflagration by hurling lighted joists into the surrounding chambers\r\nand cloisters.\r\n\r\nStanding on the stairs of the Nicanor Gate so that he might the more\r\nplainly be seen, Titus, shouting his loudest and making signals with\r\nhis hand, gave orders to the soldiers to extinguish the fire.\r\n\r\nBut so great was the roaring of the flames and the din of the combat\r\nthat few could hear him, and those that did affected not to understand,\r\nbut went on with the double work of carnage and plunder.\r\n\r\n“’Tis useless to restrain them,” said Tiberius Alexander. “They are\r\ndrunk with delight at having come as they think to the end of their\r\nlabors. Discipline is at an end for this night at least. The soldier\r\nwill acknowledge no master but his own will.”\r\n\r\n“Must we let the temple burn to the ground?” asked Titus in despair.\r\n\r\nAlexander shrugged his shoulders. Secretly he was not at all displeased\r\nby the turn events were taking.\r\n\r\n“Let us try at least to save the Golden House,” said Titus, commanding\r\nhis bodyguard to open a way for him into the inner court.\r\n\r\nThe Sanctuary formed a series of terraces, and upon the highest of\r\nall, within the Court of the Priests, stood the world-famed Golden\r\nHouse--the shrine containing the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies--now\r\nlovely in the firelight and flashing with a splendor that dazzled the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nDriven from all other parts of the Sanctuary the Zealots gathered about\r\nthis golden shrine, determined that it should not be profaned by the\r\nfoot of the heathen Gentile.\r\n\r\nThe triumphant Romans followed to the attack, and a desperate fight\r\nensued.\r\n\r\nSword in hand the furious Zealots fell by hundreds, and at last Simon\r\nand John, seeing that all was lost, massed the survivors at one point,\r\nand charging at their head, succeeded in cutting their way through\r\nthe Roman ranks out into the Court of the Gentiles, and thence by the\r\nbridge that spanned the Tyropæon they made their way into the Upper\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the Zealots was followed by a terrible carnage around\r\nthe great brazen altar of sacrifice, a sort of truncated pyramid,\r\nforty-eight feet square at the base, standing directly in front of the\r\nGolden House. Hither, upon the first entering of the Romans, had fled\r\na helpless, trembling crowd of children, women, and aged men, thinking\r\nthat the sanctity of the spot would stay the sword of the conqueror.\r\n\r\nVain hope!\r\n\r\nThe foe, made cruel by the long duration of the siege, stabbed and slew\r\nwithout distinction of age or sex; the bodies of the dead lay piled\r\nlike hecatombs upon the sacrificial altar; upon the pavement around\r\nthe red blood spread in a quickly widening circle, till, reaching the\r\nmarble stairs, it rolled in sullen streams into the courts below.\r\n\r\nThough isolated groups of desperate Jews continued here and there to\r\nfight Titus was now practically master of the temple, but the victory\r\ngave him little pleasure when he noticed the progress made by the\r\nfire, which, fanned by the wind, had reached one end of the northern\r\ncloister, and, having turned the angle, was now fast advancing along\r\nthe western cloister, and would soon be on a line parallel with the\r\nwestern wall of the Golden House; true, a space separated the cloister\r\nfrom the shrine, but the space was, perhaps, not too wide for the\r\nflames to leap across; already sparks and fragments of fiery matter,\r\nfloated by the wind, were beginning to patter upon the fretted and\r\npinnacled roof.\r\n\r\nMoved by Titus’ look of despair, Alexander put forth a suggestion.\r\n\r\n“We can perhaps preserve it by drenching its roof with water.”\r\n\r\n“But whence the water?”\r\n\r\n“There is a draw-well on the southern side of the Sanctuary.”\r\n\r\nSpringing upon one of the many marble tables where sacrificial\r\nvictims were laid prior to their being offered upon the brazen altar,\r\nTitus, trying to make his voice heard above the noise of fire and\r\nvociferation, shouted that the soldiers should bring water for the\r\npreserving of the Golden House.\r\n\r\nBut none would put hand to the work, for the sides and western end of\r\nthis house were set about with treasury vaults, and the fool who spent\r\nhis time like a slave in fetching water would lose the chance of\r\nenriching himself.\r\n\r\n“Urge them to the work, Liberalis!” cried Titus, addressing a\r\ncenturion. “Threaten them! Strike them with your staff!”\r\n\r\nLiberalis did so, but all in vain; respect for Cæsar gave way to the\r\ninsatiable desire for plunder.\r\n\r\n“Let us see the interior of the Golden House, ere it perish forever,”\r\nsaid Alexander.\r\n\r\nSpeaking thus, he led the way; Titus and his staff followed, walking\r\nankle-deep in blood.\r\n\r\nEntering the Propyleon, a magnificent porch with wings on each hand\r\nextending far beyond the width of the shrine, they stood before the\r\ngreat golden gate, and found it barred from within.\r\n\r\n“’Twill require a battering-ram to force it,” said Titus, hesitating at\r\nsuch a measure. There came into his mind tales told him by Berenice of\r\nGentiles who had fallen dead for profaning a place sacred to the Jewish\r\npriesthood only.\r\n\r\n“There is a little wicket at the side by which the priest enters to\r\nunbar the door in the morning,” said Alexander. “The noble Agrippa will\r\nperhaps lead the way?” he added, addressing that king, who stood beside\r\nTitus.\r\n\r\nBut Agrippa declined the honor.\r\n\r\n“Nay, I’ll give thee the precedency,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Thy face is pale, Agrippa. Thou fearest,” sneered Alexander.\r\n\r\nWhat no orthodox Jew durst do, and what even the Roman hesitated at,\r\nwas done by the apostate Alexander.\r\n\r\nPutting his shoulder to the little wicket he forced it wide, passed\r\nboldly within, and, having first drawn aside the Babylonian curtain, he\r\nunbarred the double doors, and flung open the Holy Place to the profane\r\ngaze of the Romans, who saw what they had never before seen, what no\r\nman would ever see again.\r\n\r\nA low murmur of admiration broke from Titus and his staff at the beauty\r\nof the golden interior all radiant in the wild light of the leaping\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nOn the right or north side was seen the golden table, but without the\r\ntwelve loaves of shewbread; on the left the seven-branched golden\r\ncandlestick, unlighted; at the far end rose the golden altar of\r\nincense, standing in front of the solemn “veil,” a curtain of linen\r\nfinely twined; in color an admirable mingling of blue, and scarlet, and\r\npurple, and wrought in golden thread with the figures of cherubim.\r\n\r\n“Let these things be brought forth and kept against the day of my\r\ntriumph,” said Titus.\r\n\r\nEmboldened by the example of Alexander he passed into the Holy Place\r\nand came to the veil that hung at its far end.\r\n\r\nThis Alexander lifted, and Titus gazed with curious eye upon the Holy\r\nof Holies, the place where the Shechinah had once dwelt. But the Divine\r\nPresence had long since departed; the place was empty save for an\r\noblong stone upon which rested a golden ark with two golden cherubim,\r\none on each side, having their faces bent downwards and their wings\r\nexpanded. The stone itself was not without interest, seeing that, in\r\nHebrew opinion, it marked the very center of the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nDirecting that the ark and the cherubim, with the other sacred\r\nfurniture, should be carried to his own quarters, Titus came forth\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe imagination of Dante could scarcely conceive a scene more wild and\r\nweird than that now taking place.\r\n\r\nA wind blowing from the north carried into the temple-courts whirling\r\nclouds of smoke and intermittent gusts of heat that came and went like\r\nthe breath of a fiery furnace.\r\n\r\nAmid the roaring of the flames could be heard the shrieks of victims\r\ncut off from escape, intermingled with the crackling of cedar roofs\r\nand the crash of falling masonry.\r\n\r\nThe shouting legionaries, fierce with the lust for gold, were running\r\nhither and thither like madmen, ransacking first this chamber and\r\nthen that. Here and there some priest, detected in hiding, would find\r\nhimself surrounded by fierce-eyed soldiers, and with the keen edge of\r\na sword laid across his windpipe, he would be addressed with the cry,\r\n“Show us gold, and you shall live!” And wild were scenes that occurred\r\nwhen some new vault was discovered glittering with treasure, the\r\nplunderers trampling each other down in their eagerness to be first at\r\nthe spoil.\r\n\r\nOn all sides were to be seen men carrying off vessels of gold\r\nand silver, ingots of the same precious metals, bags of shekels,\r\njewel-hilted weapons, myrrhine vases, caskets of ivory, ebony,\r\nand alabaster filled with spices, ointments, and perfumes, costly\r\nvestments, and ten thousand other objects of spoil. Never in all the\r\nworld’s history did riches so vast fall to the lot of a conquering army\r\nas fell to those who plundered the temple--riches that were destined\r\nwithin a week to send down the price of gold in the markets of Syria to\r\none-half of its former value!\r\n\r\nThe attention of Titus was attracted by two men who were dragging along\r\na heavy cedar chest which they had just rescued from the flames; but on\r\nbreaking it open, they found within, not gold, as they had hoped, but\r\nbooks merely--historic writings, temple records, genealogical rolls,\r\nand the like. In their disappointment the two were about to set fire to\r\nthe whole, but were checked by Titus.\r\n\r\n“Hold! Let these be kept for Josephus. I doubt not that he will esteem\r\nthem more highly than gold. Carry this chest to my tent.”\r\n\r\nBut though Titus might save the sacred books of the temple, the Golden\r\nHouse he could not save.\r\n\r\nUnperceived by him a soldier, moved by a frenzy to destroy, held a\r\nlighted torch between the hinges of the golden door; a flame sprang up\r\nwhich, from lack of water to quench it, spread rapidly over the whole,\r\na sight viewed with satisfaction by the soldiery.\r\n\r\n“Where is now the God of the Jews?” they cried.\r\n\r\nNumerous figures, clad in priestly vestments, now appeared upon the\r\nburning roof.\r\n\r\n“Who are these?” asked Titus.\r\n\r\n“Priests,” replied Alexander, “forced by the heat from the secret\r\nchambers, of which there are many about the Golden House.”\r\n\r\n“Surrender, and your lives shall be spared,” shouted Titus.\r\n\r\nBut to this invitation the priests replied by a flood of curses.\r\nWrenching from the roof the gilded spikes, with their leaden sockets,\r\nthey hurled them as missiles against the foe.\r\n\r\nThe eddying flames, the blinding smoke, the overpowering heat, now\r\nforced Titus and every other Roman, not only from the vicinity of the\r\nGolden House, but from the Sanctuary itself; for the outer circle of\r\nfire, having traversed both the western and eastern cloisters, had now\r\nseized upon the southern side, threatening to cut off the retreat of\r\nall who lingered within.\r\n\r\nAs there was still abundant pillage left, the soldiers quitted the\r\nburning building with reluctance; some lingering too long were\r\novertaken by the flames, and did not quit it at all, while others by\r\ntheir scorched clothing, singed eyebrows, and half-burnt beards showed\r\nhow narrowly they had escaped death.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing to a safe distance Titus and his staff continued to watch\r\nthe appalling spectacle, the like of which they had not seen since the\r\nburning of Rome by Nero.\r\n\r\n“The whole summit of the hill blazed like a volcano. One after another\r\nthe buildings fell in with a tremendous crash, and were swallowed up\r\nin the fiery abyss. The roofs of cedar were like sheets of flame; the\r\ngilded pinnacles shone like spikes of red light. The gate towers sent\r\nup tall columns of flame and smoke.”[34]\r\n\r\nBut if it were an appalling spectacle to the Roman what was it to the\r\nJew?\r\n\r\nAll along the northern ramparts of Mount Zion was gathered a vast\r\nmultitude (for though myriads had died of famine, there were still\r\nmyriads left)--a countless host of gaunt, famishing specters, who\r\nlooked fearfully into each other’s eyes as if asking whether what they\r\nsaw could be real.\r\n\r\nMust they let go the great hope that had so long sustained them? During\r\nthe space of four years, ever since the outbreak of the war, they\r\nhad lived in hope of the immediate advent of the Messiah, who should\r\noverturn the empire of the wicked Romans and establish a glorious\r\nkingdom for Israel.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the end of it all--to know that the fiery star in the\r\nsky had been but mocking them all this time; to learn that their own\r\nJehovah had taken the side of the heathen enemy! to see the temple,\r\nwhich they had supposed eternal, sinking in the flames! to be so\r\nnear the realization of the grandest of visions, and to be forced to\r\nrenounce it when their tutelary angel had already partially withdrawn\r\nthe cloud! to be compelled to accept the soul-shaking alternative that\r\neither their holy scriptures had lied in stating that the Messiah\r\nshould come during the time of the Second Temple, or that He must have\r\nalready appeared, only to be rejected by them! to see all their bright\r\nhopes vanish into space! Was ever nation so fearfully deceived as this\r\nnation?\r\n\r\nThey gazed again and again in doubt and bewilderment; and when, at\r\nlast, they were forced to realize that the temple was actually blazing,\r\nand that angelic powers would NOT descend from the skies to help them,\r\nthere pealed forth into the infinity of night long shrieks, terrible\r\nin their pathos and despair; the shrieks of a dying nation; shrieks so\r\npiercingly loud that they were echoed and re-echoed from all the hills\r\nthat surrounded the city.\r\n\r\nSlowly the leaping flames sank and died out, to be followed here and\r\nthere by intermittent flashes and flickerings; and then, at last, the\r\ndarkness of night fell over the smoking, smoldering, blackened ruins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree centuries later the heathen emperor Julian, resolving to show\r\nthat Christ was a false prophet, called upon the Jews to rebuild their\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nThe supernatural circumstances attending the defeat of this project\r\non the part of him, whose last, dying cry was, “Thou hast conquered,\r\nO Galilæan!” are attested alike by pagan and by Christian writer. The\r\nlesson of history is clear: THE ABOLITION OF THE TEMPLE WAS THE ACT OF\r\nGOD!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                             “JUDÆA CAPTA!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus was the temple burnt, and when Titus learned--for the matter was\r\nsecretly reported to him--whose was the hand that had kindled the first\r\nflame, he swore by all his gods that Crispus should suffer death; and,\r\nin so resolving, he tried to think that he was actuated by a spirit of\r\njustice, and not by the wish of removing one who was a hindrance to his\r\nunion with Berenice. That princess had often spoken of Crispus’ purpose\r\nas touching the temple, but at her fears Titus had laughed, never\r\nthinking that Crispus would so far transcend all rules of military\r\ndiscipline as to dare to fire a magnificent edifice without due orders\r\nfrom his commander-in-chief. But Crispus _had_ dared so to act, and\r\nfiercely did Titus express his wrath to those of his officers with whom\r\nhe breakfasted next morning.\r\n\r\nTiberius Alexander tried to placate his angry chief.\r\n\r\n“What command did Crispus disobey? He fired the building ere he learned\r\nof your decree.”\r\n\r\n“Is Crispus, forsooth, commander-in-chief? By whose orders did he act?”\r\n\r\n“By those of the immortal gods, I verily believe,” replied Alexander.\r\n“Josephus, whom you regard so highly, will tell you that it is the\r\nDivine will that the temple should perish. Crispus could not resist his\r\ndestiny. It was fated that he should so act.”\r\n\r\n“Very like. And ’twas fated, too, that I should behead him.”\r\n\r\nAlexander’s face darkened.\r\n\r\n“By so treating the bravest soldier in your army you will incense the\r\nlegions to the verge of mutiny.”\r\n\r\n“Be that as it may,” retorted Titus, frowning, for he well knew that\r\nthere was truth in what the other had said.\r\n\r\n“And you will lose my services, for I shall immediately return to\r\nAlexandria.”\r\n\r\n“And I shall resign my tribuneship,” said Rufus.\r\n\r\n“And I!”--“And I!” came from many others.\r\n\r\nAs he beheld the stern faces of his staff Titus saw the imperative\r\nnecessity of revoking his too hasty judgment upon Crispus. He could not\r\nafford to lose his bravest officers with that terrible stronghold of\r\nZion--the goal of all his labors--still untaken. Moreover, there was\r\nVespasian to think of; he would not be pleased at the execution of one\r\nfor whom he had always entertained a fatherly affection.\r\n\r\n“Summon Crispus to our presence,” said he moodily, addressing a\r\ncenturion.\r\n\r\nThe messenger departed, and presently returned with a grave face.\r\nCrispus, it seemed, had been carried forth from the previous night’s\r\nbattle so slashed with wounds that his recovery was a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\n“He was endeavoring,” stated the centurion, “to save from slaughter an\r\naged widow, named Miriam, who had taken refuge at the altar--an action\r\non his part that so incensed some of those Syrian allies who, if Cæsar\r\nwill pardon me for saying it, are the curse of our army, that they\r\ndared to turn their arms against him--a Roman tribune!”\r\n\r\n“By Castor, if he can point them out, they shall be crucified!”\r\nexclaimed Titus. “Well, since he cannot come to me, I must go to him.\r\nO, fear not, brave captains,” he added, observing their dubious looks,\r\n“my resentment is over. You have my word for it that Crispus shall come\r\nto no hurt through me.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he followed the centurion, and came to the castellum, or\r\nfort, where upon a pallet lay Crispus, swathed in bandages, and looking\r\nmore dead than alive.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the pallid figure disarmed all Titus’ anger, and in\r\nsympathetic tones he expressed his sorrow at seeing Crispus in such\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n“It is better thus,” said Crispus, believing his end to be at hand.\r\n“Berenice will be free.”\r\n\r\n“Now by the gods!” exclaimed Titus, his better nature flashing out,\r\n“a plague on these women who set friend and friend at variance. If\r\nBerenice is to be won only at the cost of your life, may she never be\r\nwon, say I. But as to this matter, do you know that Berenice denies\r\nthat she was the veiled lady of Beth-tamar?”\r\n\r\n“But you do not believe her?”\r\n\r\nTitus’ silence would seem to show that he was of the same opinion as\r\nCrispus.\r\n\r\nHe spoke a few more cheering words, and then took his departure.\r\nMaking his way to the ruins of the temple, he was hailed with loud\r\ncries of “_Ave, Imperator!_” by the soldiery, who, assembled before\r\nthe blackened eastern gate, were offering incense and prayers to the\r\neagles, the gods that, in their superstitious fancy, had given them the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n“‘Imperator!’” said Titus scornfully, recalling their disobedience of\r\nthe previous night. “Very much imperator, when ye let the temple burn\r\ncontrary to my will.”\r\n\r\nIt was customary among the Roman troops to honor the victorious\r\ngeneral with a new title drawn from the name of the people subdued by\r\nhim--Scipio _Africanus_ and Metellus _Creticus_ are cases in point--but\r\nwhen some of the soldiery proceeded further to salute Titus with the\r\nepithet “_Judaicus_,” he sternly forbade them to use an appellation\r\nthat he knew would be a perpetual reminder to Berenice of the fall of\r\nher nation.\r\n\r\nThough the ordinary soldier was left to cure his wounds as best he\r\nmight, with the aid of his sympathizing comrades, Titus himself was\r\nattended in this campaign by a Greek physician, whom he now sent to\r\nwatch over Crispus, and great was the satisfaction throughout the\r\ncamp when it became known that the state of the patient was such as to\r\nafford good ground for hope.\r\n\r\nA week later Titus, when paying a second visit to Crispus, dwelt again\r\non the subject of Berenice.\r\n\r\n“No man,” said he, “would risk his life, as you did, in rescuing a\r\ndamsel from a beleaguered city--you see I know the story--unless he\r\nwere madly enamored of her. Since your heart is set, not upon Berenice\r\nbut upon this Vashti, what is to prevent you from repudiating the one\r\nand taking the other?”\r\n\r\n“Firstly, I have not said that my heart _is_ set upon Vashti; secondly,\r\neven if it were so, my Christian creed forbids me acting in the way\r\nyour prescribe. With Christians marriage is a perpetual obligation.”\r\n\r\n“Crispus, don’t deny it; you love this Vashti, and yet you are going to\r\nallow your foolish religion--for such must I call it--to stand in the\r\nway of your desires. But I doubt whether you fully understand your own\r\ncreed. I have been conversing with some of your faith, for it appears\r\nthat you are not the only Christian in our army, and their saying is\r\nthat if a wife takes a lover, her husband is justified in obtaining a\r\ndivorce. It is Berenice’s intention,” added Titus significantly, “to\r\nsupply you with the grounds for one.”\r\n\r\nIn his pagan days Crispus would have readily availed himself of this\r\nway of escaping from a union that was hateful to him, but being no\r\nlonger a pagan, he would not consent to Berenice’s doing evil that\r\nthereby good might come to him.\r\n\r\n“Cæsar,” said he, “I will be no party to this scheme, which I look upon\r\nas an infamous one. Nay, more; if you so act, I will have justice upon\r\nyou. Forget not the oath of your sire, Vespasian, that he would hang\r\nthe man who takes my wife from me, though that man were his own son. Do\r\nthis thing, and I will accuse you at the foot of the imperial throne,\r\nand demand that he keep his word.”\r\n\r\nTitus laughed pleasantly.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the risk,” said he.\r\n\r\nAnd with that he withdrew, bent on fulfilling his purpose, as Crispus\r\nwas equally bent on fulfilling his.\r\n\r\nAmong others that visited Crispus during his illness was Josephus, who,\r\nas intending to write a history of the war, was naturally desirous of\r\nobtaining all the information he could respecting the burning of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nCrispus complied with this request, but as he had no particular desire\r\nfor worldly fame, he added:\r\n\r\n“Keep my name out of the history.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” smiled Josephus, “in view of your great deeds?”\r\n\r\n“Quite possible. You can allude to me as ‘a certain captain tribune,’\r\nor ‘one of the soldiers.’” And then, turning to a matter of far more\r\ninterest to him than future fame, he said, “Do you know that your ward\r\nVashti is a slave in the household of the Princess Berenice?”\r\n\r\n“Yea, I know it,” said Josephus with a queer smile, the meaning of\r\nwhich was not at all apparent to Crispus, “and I am this day setting\r\noff for Cæsarea, carrying to the princess a letter from Titus enjoining\r\nher to deal tenderly with my ward.”\r\n\r\n“That is good, but it would be better were he sending an order that she\r\nmust be set at liberty. However, that will perhaps come in time,” he\r\ncontinued, resolving to petition Vespasian on behalf of Vashti. “But\r\nlet me not delay you. Go, and heaven prosper your mission.”\r\n\r\nCrispus had ordered that his bed should be placed by a window from\r\nwhich he could watch the preparations that were being made to storm\r\nMount Zion, where the implacable Zealots were making their last stand.\r\nWith the capture of that stronghold, the long siege would be brought\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nTitus had offered, by the mouth of Josephus, to spare the lives of all\r\nthe insurgents on the condition of instant surrender. But Simon and\r\nJohn still talked big. They demanded a free passage for themselves and\r\ntheir followers, together with their wives and children, promising to\r\ndepart to some far-off spot in the wilderness. Titus rejected these\r\nterms, and in his anger vowed to slay every man, woman, and child, and\r\nto level the city to the ground.\r\n\r\nThen did Crispus rejoice that Vashti was delivered from the possibility\r\nof such doom.\r\n\r\nThe Roman banks were completed in eighteen days, and on the nineteenth\r\nmorning Titus began his attack upon the northern wall of Zion.\r\n\r\nEven now it was within the power of the Zealots to prolong the siege\r\nfor many weeks in virtue of their almost impregnable position in those\r\nthree magnificent fortresses, Hippicus, Phasaelus, and Mariamne. But\r\nthe steady and triumphant progress of the Roman arms through the\r\nsuburb of Bezetha and the suburb of Acra, over the ruins of Antonia\r\nand the ruins of the temple, had put a secret fear into the heart\r\nof the Zealots, so that as soon as they heard the terrible rams\r\nswinging and pounding against the walls of Zion they quitted their\r\nfortifications, and fled. Some sought the catacombs with which the\r\nsub-soil of Jerusalem is everywhere honeycombed; others, opening the\r\nsouthern gates, made a wild and futile attempt to force the Roman line\r\nof circumvallation.\r\n\r\nWith a fierce shouting that seemed to shake the very towers, the\r\ntriumphant legionaries poured over the walls, and proceeded to carry\r\nfire and sword through the length and breadth of the city. Enraged by\r\nthe long opposition of the Zealots, the Romans made no distinction\r\nbetween the innocent and the guilty, but wreaked upon all alike, man,\r\nwoman, and child, the accumulated vengeance of a long term of weeks.\r\n\r\nThe flames of night lit up wild scenes of carnage, lust, and rapine,\r\nscenes that have scarcely any parallel in history. One significant fact\r\nattests the extent of the slaughter--the fires on the lower parts of\r\nZion were extinguished by the rivers of blood that poured down from the\r\nhigher!\r\n\r\nThe Romans only ceased from slaying when their arms had become weary\r\nof striking; the surviving Jews--still to be counted by myriads--were\r\ndriven like sheep across the Tyropæon bridge to the ruined cloisters of\r\nthe temple, where they were put under guard. Scores of them, sullen and\r\ndefiant to the last, refused to taste food prepared by Gentile hands,\r\nand so died.\r\n\r\nWhen Titus entered the city and beheld the massy towers which the\r\nZealots had so cravenly relinquished, he was filled with wonder.\r\n\r\n“Truly,” he murmured, “unless the gods had put it into the hearts of\r\nthese men to flee, we should never by our own strength have taken these\r\ntowers.”\r\n\r\nBut however much Titus may have thought himself indebted to Divine\r\npower, he showed little of the Divine in his treatment of the captive\r\nmultitude, who, if the figures of Josephus are to be trusted, amounted\r\nto ninety-seven thousand!\r\n\r\nFor many days a sorting process went on in the temple-courts. Those who\r\nwere convicted of having borne arms against the Romans were executed\r\nat once. Seven hundred others, the tallest and most handsome, were set\r\naside to grace the triumph of Titus. Of the rest, those under seventeen\r\nyears of age were sold into slavery; all who had passed that age were\r\neither sent in fetters to Egypt, there to work in the mines, or were\r\ndistributed among the provinces, to die in the amphitheater by the\r\nsword of the gladiator or by the fangs of wild beasts. As for the aged\r\nand infirm, these, as being useless and unsaleable, were simply put to\r\ndeath in cold blood. Thus were weeping families parted to meet no more\r\non earth; never were such heartrending scenes as those that took place\r\nin the temple-courts upon the closing days of September in the year\r\nA.D. 70, and all under the sanction of the Cæsar who was called by his\r\nsycophantic contemporaries, “_Amor et deliciæ generis humani_--the love\r\nand darling of mankind!”\r\n\r\nAs Crispus heard the nightly wailings of the captive multitude he\r\nlonged for the day when the progress of Christianity should temper\r\nwarfare with a spirit more humane and merciful.\r\n\r\nJosephus received the privilege of setting free from among the\r\nprisoners all his former friends, of whom he must have possessed a\r\nremarkable number, seeing that, after setting aside his father and\r\nmother, he contrived to liberate nearly two hundred more of the throng.\r\n\r\nThere were two faces, however, he looked for in vain.\r\n\r\n“What hath become of Simeon ben Gamaliel?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Slain at the taking of Zion,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“And Johanan ben Zacchai?”\r\n\r\nThat rabbi, it appeared, was now at Jamnia in southern Judæa, having\r\nescaped from the holy city in a very singular manner.[35] Feigning\r\nto be dead, he was placed in a coffin, which the Zealot sentinels at\r\nthe gate permitted to be carried forth for burial within his father’s\r\nsepulcher in the glen of Cedron. When once outside the city Johanan\r\nmade his way to the Roman lines; and being permitted to pass by the\r\ngood will of Crispus before whom he happened to be brought, he retired\r\nto Jamnia. And here, in subsequent years, he established the celebrated\r\nrabbinical school whose teaching was destined ultimately to develop\r\ninto that strange system of Jewish scholasticism known as the Talmud.\r\n\r\nTitus ordered the city to be razed to the ground with the exception\r\nof the three great towers--Hippicus, Phasaelus, and Mariamne. These\r\nwere spared partly for the accommodation of a garrison to be stationed\r\nthere with a view of preventing any attempt at rebuilding by the Jews,\r\nbut mainly to demonstrate to posterity what kind of a city it was that\r\nRoman valor had subdued.\r\n\r\nTerentius Rufus was appointed to superintend this work of demolition,\r\nand his first care was to remove Crispus to the splendid apartments in\r\nthe tower Hippicus, as being more conducive to the patient’s recovery\r\nthan the close and squalid quarters of the castellum, in which he had\r\nhitherto lain.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of vexation to Titus that Simon the Black and John of\r\nGiscala were not to be found among the captive multitude. It turned\r\nout that the two Zealot chiefs had taken refuge in the catacombs\r\nbeneath the city, and though the dauntless Simon contrived for a while\r\nto elude pursuit, John, reduced by stress of famine, came forth from\r\nhis hiding-place to meet, by a singular leniency on the part of the\r\nconqueror, with the sentence of perpetual imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the Roman troops, having done the work they had set out to\r\ndo, broke up their camp and commenced a slow and stately march to\r\nCæsarea-by-the-sea, leading with them a long train of melancholy\r\ncaptives, the remnants of a once great nation, together with the spoils\r\nof the temple.\r\n\r\nTerentius Rufus was left behind with the Legio Fretensis--bricks\r\nstamped with the name of this legion are still found in the sub-soil\r\nof Zion--and he proceeded to execute the work of demolition with a\r\nthoroughness that has made his memory forever hated by the Jews. The\r\nTalmud has no more fearful curses than those laid upon the head of him\r\nwhom, with the Oriental peculiarity for disfiguring Western names, it\r\nmiscalls _Turnus_ Rufus.\r\n\r\nOver the site of what had once been a splendid and populous city he\r\ndrew a plow in accordance with the oath which he had sworn to the Jews.\r\n\r\n“Where is now their God?” he laughed, in scornful ignorance that his\r\nown action was a striking confirmation to the truth of the Hebrew\r\nreligion, for had not the prophet written, “_Zion shall be plowed as a\r\nfield_”?\r\n\r\nFor the accommodation of the garrison, however, a few houses were\r\nleft standing upon the western side of the city, and among them the\r\ncelebrated _Cænaculum_,[36] or House of the Last Supper, destined in\r\nthe age of Constantine to be transformed into a Christian church.\r\n\r\nFor more than a month that fugitive of the catacombs, Simon, continued\r\nto evade arrest. Attended by a small but faithful band of miners and\r\nhewers of stone, well provided with cutting tools, he had been essaying\r\nthe gigantic feat of boring his way through the solid rock to a point\r\nthat should be beyond the ken of the Roman garrison, but the difficulty\r\nof the work and the failure of provisions compelled him to relinquish\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\nHe then took a singular step.\r\n\r\nAssuming a white robe and a mantle of purple he emerged unexpectedly\r\nfrom the ground in the very place where the temple had stood, thinking\r\nperhaps by this act to impress the Romans with the belief that he was\r\na new Messiah resuscitated from the dead.[37] As a matter of fact, the\r\nsoldiers in the vicinity were not a little awe-struck at sight of this\r\nstrange apparition rising from the ground. Their first amazement over,\r\nthey drew near, formed a circle round him, and demanded who he was.\r\n\r\nBut Simon declared that his name was not for vulgar ears.\r\n\r\n“Call your commandant,” said he with a mysterious air.\r\n\r\nBut when that commandant proved to be one well acquainted with the\r\nfeatures and figure of Simon, the Zealot chief saw that deception was\r\nat an end.\r\n\r\nRufus received him with a pitying smile.\r\n\r\n“Simon, if thou art attempting to imitate the God of my friend Crispus,\r\nthou art playing the part to no purpose. I know thee to be mortal man.\r\nThou art my prisoner. This is a sorry ending for thee. Why didst not\r\nthou, Roman fashion, fall on thy blade, and so round off thy wild life?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis forbidden by our law to slay one’s self,” returned Simon. “Now\r\ntell me what will be my doom?”\r\n\r\n“Titus hath already decreed it. With a rope round thy neck thou wilt\r\nmarch through Rome in Cæsar’s great triumphal procession that all the\r\ncitizens may see what manner of man it was that kept their soldiers at\r\nbay so long. As thou walkest, attendant lictors will beat thee with\r\nrods, for such is the custom. If it will give thee any pleasure thou\r\nwilt see borne aloft before thee the holy vessels of thy temple. But\r\nwhile these will be carried on to the journey’s end to be laid up in\r\nthe temple of Peace, thou, at a certain point in the procession, wilt\r\nbe led aside to the Tarpeian Rock, precipitated therefrom and slain.\r\nAnd a mighty shout of joy will go up from the multitude, for it is\r\nnot till thy death has been announced that the sacrifices and the\r\nfeasting will begin. Now, I might pity thee, but that the memory of the\r\nmassacred Roman garrisons hardens my heart.”\r\n\r\n“Better to fall with Israel than to triumph with Rome,” retorted the\r\nZealot.\r\n\r\nRufus had no further parley with his prisoner, but dispatched him\r\nat once to Titus, who was then at Cæsarea. What must have been the\r\nfeelings of Simon, when he found himself journeying along the same road\r\nas that on which he had gained his memorable victory over Cestius?\r\nVerily, the fortune of war had indeed changed!\r\n\r\nIt was not till three months after the burning of the temple that\r\nCrispus was strong enough to leave his chamber in Hippicus, and walk\r\nwith halting step among the shapeless heaps of stones which represented\r\nall that was left of the once proud city.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Rufus he ascended the temple-hill. Its columns and\r\ncloisters, chambers and courts, had vanished, but the Legio Fretensis\r\nwith all their toil had been unable to pull apart the masonry of the\r\nvast basement on which the temple structures had rested.\r\n\r\nIt remained, and remains to this day, a part of it forming the\r\ncelebrated “Wailing-place” of the Jews.\r\n\r\nNow as Crispus and Rufus stood there, they were surprised to see a band\r\nof men and women, quiet and orderly, ascending Mount Moriah from the\r\nVale of Cedron.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near, Crispus recognized in them his friends of Pella.\r\nThere was the saintly bishop Simeon, who had baptized both him and\r\nVashti; and there, too, were the two youthful grandsons of the apostle\r\nJude, destined on account of their Davidic descent to be haled one day\r\nbefore the jealous tyrant Domitian, and by him to be dismissed again as\r\ninnocent and foolish visionaries.\r\n\r\n“Now, who be ye?” asked Rufus, casting a suspicious glance at the\r\nthrong.\r\n\r\n“We are natives of Jerusalem, who, four years ago, quitted the city,\r\nrather than take up arms against the Romans.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a point in your favor.”\r\n\r\n“These,” explained Crispus, “are the Christians who befriended me\r\nduring the time of my proscription by Nero.”\r\n\r\n“And what would ye here?” asked Rufus, addressing them.\r\n\r\n“We seek to inhabit this place again, and to carry on our worship as\r\nheretofore.”\r\n\r\n“What! Think ye that Titus has destroyed this city merely to see it\r\nbuilt again?”\r\n\r\n“Titus destroyed the city as being a center of Jewish sedition,”\r\nremarked Crispus. “But these persons repudiate the Jewish religion.\r\nThey are Christians with no wish for an independent kingdom.\r\nAcknowledging the authority of Rome, they will be a hindrance to\r\nrebellion, and a source of strength to us.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! I doubt whether Titus will agree to their settling here.”\r\n\r\n“His cousin, Flavius Clemens, would. Thou knowest that he is a\r\nChristian.”\r\n\r\n“Flavius Clemens is not Cæsar.”\r\n\r\n“But his two sons may become Cæsars, seeing that Vespasian has\r\nnominated them as his heirs next after Titus and Domitian, who, as\r\nyou know, are both childless. You and I may yet live, Rufus, to see a\r\nChristian Cæsar on the throne, and a Cæsar who will know how to reward\r\nany favor shown to this little community here.”[38]\r\n\r\nThere was something in this argument, and Rufus thought he might as\r\nwell have an eye to the future. To him, personally, it was a matter of\r\nindifference whether the Christians remained or withdrew; his only wish\r\nwas not to be embroiled with Titus.\r\n\r\n“Christians,” said Rufus meditatively. “Humph! well,” he added, turning\r\nto Crispus, “since you warrant them to be orderly, and innocent of any\r\ninnovation against Rome, let them, if they will, remain and build.\r\nTitus hath not actually said aught to the contrary.”\r\n\r\nThus had the saints returning from Pella good cause to bless the day\r\nwhen they received among them the heathen and proscribed fugitive\r\nCrispus; for, thanks to his good offices, they were permitted to\r\nremain, and by their daily worship in the Cænaculum to carry on the\r\nhistoric continuity of the Church of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                          JUSTICE THE AVENGER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely sunny morning in April as Crispus and Rufus strolled\r\nalong the sands in the vicinity of Cæsarea-by-the-sea.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the new coin struck by Titus to commemorate his\r\nconquest?” asked Rufus; and, being answered in the negative, he drew\r\nforth a sesterce, and exhibited it to the gaze of Crispus.\r\n\r\nThe obverse of the coin bore the laureated head of Titus; the reverse,\r\na graceful palm-tree, at the foot of which sat the weeping figure of a\r\nwoman, emblematic of Judæa; behind the palm stood Titus in a military\r\nuniform, with his foot on a helmet, holding in his right hand a lance,\r\nand in his left a sword. The words JUDÆA CAPTA formed the legend.\r\n\r\n“This weeping figure is obviously intended as a portrait of Berenice,”\r\nremarked Crispus in some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Just so. ’Tis said that Titus, happening to see Berenice sitting\r\nbeneath a palm weeping, or pretending to weep, for her country, was so\r\nstruck by the sight that he ordered the Master of the Mint at Cæsarea\r\nto immortalize her figure and attitude in the issue of commemorative\r\ncoins.”\r\n\r\n“Did Berenice have aught to say on the matter?”\r\n\r\n“She was not averse to it.”\r\n\r\nNo; doubtless it suited her taste for emotional display to see herself\r\nset forth to the Roman world in the character of a devout patriot\r\nweeping for the fall of her country. The hollowness both of her grief\r\nand of her religion, in fact her entire lack of womanly feeling, was\r\nshown by her presence at the games held at Cæsarea Philippi in honor\r\nof Domitian’s birthday, when she could calmly sit in the amphitheater\r\nthere and see 2,500 hapless Jews slaughtered, either in combats with\r\nwild beasts, or in fighting with each other as gladiators; for Titus,\r\nprevented from sailing to Rome by reason of the advanced season at\r\nwhich the war ended--navigation being usually suspended during the\r\nwinter months--had spent his time in giving a series of fêtes in\r\nvarious cities of the East, fêtes that were seldom celebrated without\r\nthe butchery of Jews in the arena.\r\n\r\n“Berenice has been with Titus at all these festivities,” remarked\r\nRufus. “She has become his mistress, as I thought she would. So amorous\r\nare they that they all but fondle each other in public. It is Antony\r\nand Cleopatra over again. Will he marry her, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“Not till I have divorced her,” responded Crispus, quietly.\r\n\r\nRufus stared in amazement at this intimation of a secret hitherto\r\nkept from him. Crispus proceeded to tell the story of the wedding at\r\nBeth-tamar, giving his reasons for supposing Berenice to be the veiled\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“The Princess Berenice your wife?” murmured Rufus, scarcely able to\r\ncredit the statement. “Humph! and when Cæsar takes a man’s wife, where\r\nshall the man look for redress?”\r\n\r\n“He’s welcome to her. She is my wife no longer. I shall repudiate her.”\r\n\r\n“No, not yet,” exclaimed Rufus, his face suddenly lighting up with\r\nexcitement. “You must not do so just yet. You must delay your purpose\r\nfor a while in order to save Vashti.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! what mean you? How can the delay serve Vashti?”\r\n\r\nRufus laughed with a sort of good-humored contempt at what he conceived\r\nto be a sad lack of discernment on the part of Crispus.\r\n\r\n“Was there any stipulation made at this marriage that the wife was to\r\nretain the separate possession of her property?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“Then Vashti may be set free.”\r\n\r\n“How?” asked Crispus eagerly.\r\n\r\n“By you, of course. O, dullard! All you have to do now is to walk\r\ninto the presence of Titus and Berenice, and to say, ‘Woman, you are\r\nmy wife. The law gives you to me, as doth also this document signed\r\nby Vespasian.’ Titus dare not oppose you, if you are determined to\r\nassert your legal rights. Then you lead the proud princess home, by\r\nforce if she will not come by persuasion, and you address her thus:\r\n‘You are mine, and all that you have is mine, including your household\r\nslaves. Therefore, in the exercise of my lawful right, I declare this\r\nmaiden Vashti to be free.’ That’s the plan you must adopt, Crispus.\r\nAfterwards, repudiate her, if you will; but--liberate Vashti first.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, with the fire of hope coursing through his veins, resolved to\r\nfollow the daring suggestion of Rufus.\r\n\r\n“The sooner this business be done, the better,” said he.\r\n\r\n“There I agree with you. What more appropriate time than to-morrow\r\nnight when Berenice gives a grand banquet in the Prætorium, that\r\nedifice being graciously lent for the occasion by the new procurator,\r\nAntonius Julianus, who, by the way, talks of writing a history[39] of\r\nthe war, thereby entering into rivalry with Josephus. You and I are\r\ninvited to this entertainment; in truth, if you are absent, Berenice\r\nwill suffer sore disappointment, seeing that she hath prepared a little\r\nmortification for you. She hath decreed that her slave Vashti shall\r\nwait as cup-bearer upon the chief guests.”\r\n\r\n“May the intended humiliation fall upon Berenice’s own head!”\r\n\r\n“So say I. What hath our pretty Vashti done that she should be thus\r\nshamed? I confess I am beginning to dislike the princess, whom I once\r\nso much admired. You must certainly put your plan into operation\r\nto-morrow night. In the face of all the company claim Berenice as your\r\nwife, and assert your authority over her, to the confusion of Titus.\r\nShe is desirous, so ’tis said, of providing her guests with a rare\r\nentertainment; it’s very likely she’ll succeed.”\r\n\r\nCrispus, determined to adopt this scheme--he blinked its\r\ndifficulties--impatiently awaited the moment for putting it into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nWhen the time fixed for the banquet drew near, Crispus, assuming his\r\nwhitest and handsomest toga, with its broad purple border, went,\r\naccompanied by Rufus, to that palace, still called, though its founder\r\nhad been seventy years dead, Herod’s Prætorium.\r\n\r\nUpon entering he found that the scene of the feast was the same as that\r\nin which Florus had held _his_ banquet.\r\n\r\nIt was malice that made Berenice choose this hall; the very place\r\nthat had seen Vashti hailed as the queen of beauty was now to see\r\nher degraded to the condition of a slave, compelled to wait upon the\r\nprincess whose charms had been slighted by Crispus, while Crispus\r\nhimself was invited to look on and behold her humiliation.\r\n\r\nHe smiled within himself. The sequel would show whose was to be the\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\nThe banquet-hall presented a brilliant scene, thronged as it was with\r\nall the brave captains who had taken part in the war, and with fair\r\nladies whose richly dyed robes afforded a perpetual feast of color.\r\n\r\nCrispus and his companion arrived just as the guests were preparing to\r\ntake their places at the various triclinia.\r\n\r\nBerenice was there, moving with a proud and stately step, and, as\r\nthough she were already an empress, wearing an Eastern diadem upon her\r\ndark hair.\r\n\r\nBy her side walked the laureled Titus, clad in imperial purple, and\r\nseemingly in excellent spirits, though he suddenly started as he caught\r\nsight of Crispus, and over his face came a guilty look which Rufus\r\ninterpreted in his own way.\r\n\r\n“Ashamed of himself at stealing his friend’s wife. Though he be Cæsar,\r\nand my commander, I shall rejoice if he meet by and by with deserved\r\ndiscomfiture.”\r\n\r\nCrispus and Rufus were allotted places next each other, not, however,\r\nat the chief triclinium where were Titus, Berenice, Agrippa, Alexander,\r\nand others, but at an adjacent triclinium, an arrangement that suited\r\nthe two friends, who were thus enabled to talk with more freedom than\r\nthey could have enjoyed at Cæsar’s table.\r\n\r\nAt the same triclinium with Crispus was Josephus, who had his place\r\nnext to the Roman.\r\n\r\n“Do you know the humiliation intended for Vashti?” asked Crispus.\r\n\r\nJosephus signified assent, adding:\r\n\r\n“Aware that your presence here will save her, I can await the issue\r\nwith a serene mind.”\r\n\r\n“Rufus,” whispered Crispus to his friend, “you have been communicating\r\nour plan to Josephus.”\r\n\r\nBut as Rufus gave an emphatic denial to this, Crispus was not a little\r\npuzzled by the words of Josephus.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the historian sat a stately and venerable dame.\r\n\r\n“My mother,” remarked Josephus, “and her purpose in being here is the\r\nsame as mine,” he added with a mysterious smile, “to obtain Vashti’s\r\nfreedom.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed from this that Josephus, too, had some plan for delivering\r\nhis ward from Berenice’s hands. What was the nature of the plan, and\r\nwas it likely to succeed? But to all questioning Josephus remained\r\nprovokingly evasive, so that Crispus was fain to hold his soul in\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nIt soon became clear, however, from the conversation of Josephus,\r\nthat he was animated by a spirit of bitter hostility to Berenice,\r\ncaused by her patronage of those amphitheatrical games in which Jews\r\nwere pitilessly butchered. Titus, too, came in for a share of his\r\nanimadversions.\r\n\r\n“He hath ordered that the didrachmas which every adult Jew is\r\naccustomed to pay annually into the temple treasury, shall now be\r\npaid into the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter. You, as a Christian,\r\ncan understand the feeling of the Jew in this matter. And the golden\r\ncherubim that overshadowed the mercy seat he hath given to the heathen;\r\nthe sacred figures which none but the high priest was permitted to see\r\nare now profanely placed as a trophy over the eastern gate of Antioch,\r\nso that it is beginning to be known as the Gate of the Cherubim. And\r\nnigh to it he hath dedicated a chariot to the Moon, for the help which\r\nshe hath given him during the siege. The moon, forsooth!”\r\n\r\nThe signal for the feast was now given, and richly clad slaves, both\r\nmale and female, moved to and fro, attentive to the wants of the guests.\r\n\r\n“I do not see Vashti,” whispered Crispus to Josephus.\r\n\r\n“She will not enter till the drinking begins.”\r\n\r\nGay conversation went on all around, but Crispus took little or no part\r\nin it. Vashti! Vashti! was the one thought of his mind.\r\n\r\nAt last repletion came to the guests; both the heavier and the lighter\r\ndishes were removed from the tables to make way for the wines.\r\n\r\n“And now, my lords,” cried Berenice, addressing those at her own\r\ntriclinium, but speaking sufficiently loud for Crispus to hear, “I have\r\na rare vintage for you, to be offered by a cup-bearer as graceful as\r\nHebe herself.”\r\n\r\nAmong a crowd of wine-bearing slaves that now entered the hall Crispus\r\ndistinguished the form of Vashti. Quickly the slaves spread themselves\r\nto right and left, each going to his appointed place.\r\n\r\nOf the thousand persons in the banquet-hall Crispus saw but one\r\nonly--the fair girl that was moving with a light, graceful step towards\r\nthe chief triclinium.\r\n\r\nVashti, but how different from her appearance when last seen by him!\r\nThe disfigurement wrought by the famine had vanished; she was her own\r\nsweet self once more.\r\n\r\nThe charming grace and beauty of her figure were set off by a clinging\r\nrobe of pure white silk, richly embroidered with gold, and girt at\r\nthe waist with a broad, silver-sparkling zone. A necklace of pearls\r\nencircled her fair throat, and a wreath of violets rested upon her\r\ngolden ringlets.\r\n\r\nShe was the living picture of beauty; from the crown of her head to\r\nher dainty, gold-embroidered sandals there was not a flaw to mar her\r\nradiant loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Josephus’ mother glistened with pleasure at the success of\r\nthe toilet for which she was responsible, the good dame having resolved\r\nthat Vashti should appear at her fairest before the guests.\r\n\r\nAs Vashti caught Crispus’ look she gave him a smile that sent the blood\r\ncoursing like liquid fire through his veins; it was a smile that showed\r\nshe had no fear; a smile that seemed to say she knew that he could and\r\nwould save her. Was she aware of his intentions? he wondered, or was\r\nshe relying upon the aid of Josephus?\r\n\r\nBerenice, with a sudden uneasiness at her heart, began all too late to\r\nwish that she had kept her slave from appearing at this banquet, for\r\nVashti’s beauty drew murmurs of admiration from the men, if not from\r\nthe women.\r\n\r\n“Ye gods! who is this?” said Tiberius Alexander. “I did not know,\r\nprincess, that you had invited Venus to be a guest.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis only one of my slaves,” replied Berenice, outwardly calm,\r\ninwardly thrilling with jealousy.\r\n\r\n“A slave!” said Alexander, with the light of amatory desire leaping\r\ninto his eyes. “I’ll give you ten thousand aurei for her--fifteen\r\nthousand,” he added, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“I would not take a hundred myriads,” replied Berenice, coldly. “She is\r\nnot for sale.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the murmur of tongues ceased throughout the hall. The\r\nguests, catching sight of Berenice’s dark face, became suddenly silent,\r\ndesirous of discovering what was amiss.\r\n\r\nThe princess rose to her feet, and angrily faced the slave who was\r\ndisobeying her on two points--she was wearing a costume different from\r\nthat enjoined her, and she lacked the flagon of wine that it was her\r\nduty to bear.\r\n\r\n“By whose leave do you wear that dress?”\r\n\r\n“By my own,” replied Vashti, with a sweet smile that maddened the\r\nother. “Why should I consult _you_, princess, as to what manner of\r\nraiment I must wear?”\r\n\r\nIt was a revelation to Crispus to hear the hitherto submissive and\r\ngentle Vashti taking this bold stand, and he loved her the more for\r\nit. There was no tremor in her voice, nor did she shrink in the least\r\nfrom the fierce gaze of the princess. Indeed, Vashti, in her proud\r\nfearlessness, looked at that moment far more of a princess than did\r\nBerenice. What wonderful power was it that enabled her thus to brave a\r\nmistress who, if she chose, could order her off to instant scourging?\r\n\r\n“You dare speak thus to _me_?” exclaimed Berenice amazedly. “O, I see.\r\nA freewoman all these years, you cannot yet realize that you are a\r\nslave. I will overlook your offense. Go! Bring hither the flagon of\r\nwine that you were bidden to pour out for my guests.”\r\n\r\nBut Vashti shook her pretty golden tresses, and cast an arch smile at\r\nthose reclining at Berenice’s triclinium.\r\n\r\n“Nay, verily, if they desire the wine let them wait upon themselves;\r\nor perhaps _you_, princess, will play the part of cup-bearer.”\r\n\r\nBerenice stood completely dumfounded at these audacious words from one\r\nwho had hitherto behaved as her submissive slave. The men looked on\r\nwith smiles of wonder and amusement; the women were more disposed to\r\nside with the princess.\r\n\r\n“The slave claims to be a Christian,” sneered Agrippa to a fair lady by\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n“That explains her insolence,” replied his partner. “I once had one of\r\nthose creatures among my household, and know the trouble they give.\r\nWere I the princess, I would whip the new religion out of her.”\r\n\r\n“The girl must be mad,” exclaimed Berenice. “On your knees and cry\r\npardon, or----”\r\n\r\nVashti turned disdainfully away.\r\n\r\n“It has pleased me for a time to abide in your house as a slave,” said\r\nshe. “It pleases me now to resume my freedom. Give your commands to\r\nothers. There is but one person here who shall have my obedience, and\r\nthat is my lord Crispus.”\r\n\r\nShe walked to where Crispus stood--for he had risen to his feet--laid\r\nan appealing hand upon his arm, and looked with trusting eyes into his.\r\nThe supreme moment had come! But how was he to save her? His plan had\r\nmelted into thin air. It was all very well to claim Berenice as his\r\nwife, but the cold conviction suddenly struck him that his claim was\r\nbased not upon proof, but upon conjecture merely. If Berenice chose to\r\ndeny his statement, as she undoubtedly would, how could he make his\r\nword good? He turned his eyes upon Josephus, but that priest made no\r\nmovement, uttered no word. “Not yet,” he seemed to be saying.\r\n\r\n“Guards!” cried Berenice, addressing some of her own soldiers, who were\r\nstationed at intervals along the wall of the banqueting chamber. “Drag\r\nyon girl away, and bring whips hither. Since her defiance of me is\r\npublic, so, too, shall her scourging be.”\r\n\r\nEven these words did not disturb Vashti’s serenity. Her pitying smile,\r\nimplying as it did that she was secure from the threatened punishment,\r\nlashed Berenice into a secret fury.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the greatest man at the feast, Titus, had remained\r\nsilent, looking on perplexed and uneasy. The redemption of Vashti,\r\nthough he had often asked for it, was a favor Berenice would not grant\r\nhim. He was sorry for Crispus, and secretly sympathized with the daring\r\nmaid who was seeking to assert her liberty, but under the influence of\r\nhis passion for Berenice he hesitated to do the right thing, namely, to\r\ndeclare Vashti free.\r\n\r\nAs the soldiers came forward to execute Berenice’s command, Vashti\r\nturned to Titus and addressed him.\r\n\r\n“Cæsar, bid these men stay their hand till I have spoken. I have that\r\nto say which will show the justice of my cause.”\r\n\r\nAt a sign from Titus the advancing guards paused.\r\n\r\n“Say on,” he commanded, hoping that Vashti might somehow be able to\r\nfurnish him with a plausible pretext for delivering her from the power\r\nof Berenice.\r\n\r\nVerily, Vashti seemed to be doing the work from which Crispus shrank;\r\nfor she began to address Titus with a catechism very similar to what\r\nCrispus himself would have employed had he carried out his plan as\r\noriginally intended.\r\n\r\n“Have you forgotten, sire, a brief visit made by you and my lord\r\nCrispus to a house called Beth-tamar on a certain night more than four\r\nyears ago?”\r\n\r\nTitus started; he guessed what was coming, and frowned.\r\n\r\n“I have not forgotten it,” said he, with a side glance at Berenice,\r\nwhose lip curved with the scornful smile as of one who should say,\r\n“That silly story!”\r\n\r\n“You can testify that my lord Crispus wedded at Beth-tamar a woman\r\nunknown to him?--unknown, because she was veiled and spake never a\r\nword.”\r\n\r\nThis strange and romantic statement caused a murmur of surprise and\r\nwonder to run around the banquet-hall.\r\n\r\n“I can testify to that,” said Titus, with the air of one who would fain\r\ndeny what he was affirming.\r\n\r\n“Do you know the name of the woman?”\r\n\r\n“I do not,” replied Titus, with another side glance at Berenice,\r\nwhich set some of the guests wondering as to whether _she_ were the\r\nmysterious bride.\r\n\r\nAt this point Berenice, with a gesture of impatience, addressed Titus.\r\n\r\n“What hath all this to do with the question of punishing an insolent\r\nslave?”\r\n\r\n“Everything, as you will see,” returned Vashti quietly, continuing her\r\nquestions to Titus. “Did not Crispus give his bride a ring, saying that\r\nwhen the unknown lady should come to him with the said ring he would\r\nacknowledge her as his wife?”\r\n\r\n“That is so.”\r\n\r\nVashti, with eyes shining with love, and with a tender smile that made\r\nher face the more beautiful, turned to Crispus, and, withdrawing her\r\nhand from a fold of her dress where it had lain concealed, she held it\r\nforth, and there, sparkling on her finger, was the very ring that he\r\nhad given to his bride at Beth-tamar!\r\n\r\nScarcely able to grasp the momentous truth Crispus stood like one\r\nenchanted to stone, silently staring at Vashti and her ring. To think\r\nthat his marriage with Berenice, the ugly black incubus that had so\r\nlong oppressed him, was the mere figment of his own imagination! that\r\nthe sweet Christian maiden, whom he had loved from the first hour of\r\nseeing her, should be his wife, was a revelation so astounding that it\r\nwas no wonder that at first he could not give it credence.\r\n\r\nVashti gave a low, sweet laugh at his bewilderment.\r\n\r\n“I am your wife, Crispus. Won’t you protect me?”\r\n\r\nProtect her?\r\n\r\nHe put his arm about her waist--a dozen men could not have torn her\r\nfrom his grasp!--and turned to face Berenice, who for the moment was\r\nalmost as much bewildered and amazed as Crispus himself.\r\n\r\n“Prettily acted!” sneered she. “A scheme, artfully preconcerted, for\r\nthe purpose of robbing me of my slave. But it shall not succeed. That\r\nCrispus wedded someone at Beth-tamar we must believe, since Cæsar\r\nhimself affirms it; but I require something more than this girl’s word,\r\nere I shall believe her to be the wife of Crispus.”\r\n\r\n“I can confirm her statement,” said Josephus, intervening at this\r\npoint, “since it was I who conducted Vashti to Beth-tamar, and from\r\nbehind a curtain saw her wedded to the lord Crispus. And the woman who\r\nattended Vashti during the ceremony was my mother, who is here present\r\nto bear her testimony, if need be.”\r\n\r\n“And in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be\r\nestablished, princess,” remarked Alexander.\r\n\r\nBerenice though striving to maintain a calm exterior, was nevertheless\r\nfull of a secret rage at finding her intended victim slipping from her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“What if she be the wife of Crispus? She is none the less my slave.”\r\n\r\n“What? Rob a Roman noble of his wife?” interjected Alexander. “O, too\r\nbad!”\r\n\r\n“At the time I made the gift I knew not that she was the wife of\r\nCrispus,” remarked Titus, not at all displeased with the turn events\r\nwere taking.\r\n\r\n“That matters not,” returned Berenice. “The gift, if made in due legal\r\nform, as this was, can be revoked neither by you nor by a court of law.”\r\n\r\nCrispus smiled pityingly at the baffled princess.\r\n\r\n“I have here,” said he, drawing forth a papyrus-scroll, “a document\r\nthat bears a date long anterior to the time when Vashti was made a\r\nslave, a document that threatens death to those who seek to take the\r\nwife of Crispus from him. It bears the autograph signature of one\r\nwhose authority not even Titus Cæsar himself will venture to dispute,\r\nfor the signature is that of his august sire, Flavius Vespasian.”\r\n\r\n“That is so,” observed Tiberius Alexander, who had drawn near, and was\r\ninspecting the document, “and, therefore, it seems to me,” he added,\r\njocularly, “that both Cæsar and the princess, by enslaving the wife of\r\nCrispus, have made themselves liable to the death penalty. Doubtless\r\nVespasian will pardon the offenders, as they acted in ignorance. At any\r\nrate, Crispus is entitled to lead away his wife; and may good fortune\r\nattend him! The bravest man in the war has obtained the fairest woman\r\nfor his bride; that is what I say, and who will controvert it?” he\r\nadded, looking round upon the guests.\r\n\r\n“None! None!” was the answer that came from every side. Vashti’s\r\nromantic story appealed to every heart, save _one_; even those ladies\r\nwho, a few minutes before, had been most opposed to her, now joined in\r\nthe acclamations that greeted the happy pair thus strangely reunited.\r\n\r\n“Take me away,” whispered Vashti. “Anywhere, so that it be from here.”\r\n\r\nCrispus responded to her appeal. Drawing her arm within his own, he\r\npassed smilingly from the hall amid cries of “Long live the brave\r\nCrispus and his fair bride!”\r\n\r\nMiserable Berenice! Her bitterness of spirit at that moment received\r\nbut little balm from Titus’ gay whisper, “There is now no obstacle to\r\nour union,” for she had known all along that the obstacle had never\r\nexisted save in his own imagination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the moonlit gardens of the Prætorium Crispus and Vashti, seated in\r\nthe very same spot where they had sat four years before, were holding a\r\ndelightful conversation.\r\n\r\nVashti was reclining within his embrace, her little hand resting\r\nwithin his. The early Christians were very human!\r\n\r\n“And to think that during all this time you have been my wife, and I\r\nknew it not. Why did you not reveal the truth earlier?”\r\n\r\n“Because, like yourself, I was bound to secrecy for three years.”\r\n\r\n“But that time limit had gone by when I rescued you from Jerusalem.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Vashti, the brightness of her face becoming dimmed for\r\na moment by that mournful reminiscence, “but was that a time to be\r\ntalking love and wedlock? I resolved to keep the secret till the siege\r\nshould be over.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sure that you were right in doing so. The making it known\r\nwould have saved you from the hands of Berenice. Tell me, how has she\r\nused you?”\r\n\r\n“Not ill, though she would taunt me at times with your name, and\r\nthreaten to whip the Christianity out of me.”\r\n\r\n“But why did you not set yourself free earlier, by sending me the ring?”\r\n\r\n“Because she was always saying that she would give a grand\r\nentertainment at which I should serve as a slave while you should look\r\nhelplessly on; she seemed to take such delight in the notion that I\r\nresolved to await the coming of this feast; it would furnish me with\r\nan excellent opportunity of asserting my freedom and of giving her a\r\nstartling surprise.”\r\n\r\n“You have certainly succeeded in doing that, my little wife.”\r\n\r\n“_Am_ I your wife, Crispus?” said Vashti gravely. “Was not that\r\nceremony at Beth-tamar somewhat heathenish in character?”\r\n\r\n“You speak truth, dearest. We must have the blessing of the Church on\r\nour union. To-morrow we will set out for Jerusalem, where the good\r\nbishop Simeon shall join our hands.”\r\n\r\nAt this point a centurion made his appearance with a message to the\r\neffect that Titus desired the presence of Crispus and his lady.\r\n\r\nResponding, though with considerable reluctance, to this summons, the\r\ntwo repaired to the Ivory Hall, where they found Titus seated beside\r\nBerenice with Josephus standing near.\r\n\r\n“Be seated, noble Crispus and the lady Vashti.”\r\n\r\nTitus spoke with genuine affability; as for Berenice her disdainful air\r\nshowed that the presence or the absence of the pair was a matter alike\r\nof indifference to her.\r\n\r\n“I have asked Josephus,” began Titus, when the centurion had withdrawn,\r\nleaving the five together, “to tell me the meaning of the strange\r\nbusiness at Beth-tamar. He is very urgent that you also should be\r\npresent to hear him. Hence my sending for you.”\r\n\r\nWith that he nodded to the priest as a sign for him to proceed.\r\n\r\n“It may be, sire,” began Josephus, “that what I have to say will give\r\nsharp offense to one of my hearers.” Crispus guessed that Berenice was\r\nmeant. “Therefore, ere I begin, I must receive assurance from you that\r\nthe utterance shall not bring punishment upon the utterer.”\r\n\r\n“Say what thou wilt; abuse me, if it please thee; thy tongue shalt have\r\nfree license to-night.”\r\n\r\nAssured thus, Josephus began.\r\n\r\n“I have but lately returned, O Cæsar, from a visit to Pontus, where it\r\nwas my fortune to meet with Zeno, the secretary of the royal Polemo,\r\nand seemingly a man well acquainted with the secrets of the late king.\r\nIt is partly from this Zeno, and partly from my own knowledge, that I\r\nderive the materials for the story I am about to relate.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the names Polemo and Zeno, Berenice, who had\r\nhitherto betrayed a languid indifference, began to appear as if keenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n“Many years ago--twenty-three, to give the exact number--the Princess\r\nBerenice, then in her twentieth year, married Polemo, king of Pontus,\r\nwho, after two years, repudiated her, for a reason the princess herself\r\nknows.”\r\n\r\nHere Josephus ceased speaking, checked by Berenice’s haughty and\r\nindignant stare.\r\n\r\n“Is it necessary to bring _my_ name into your narration?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely necessary.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will tell you the reason of our separation. He did not\r\nrepudiate me; I left him of my own free will, left him because, prior\r\nto our marriage, he, himself a proselyte, promised that he would do all\r\nin his power to bring the people of Pontus over to Judaism. He failed\r\nto redeem his word, however--nay, he actively thwarted my attempts at\r\nproselytism, and so I left him.”\r\n\r\n“Was there not a daughter born of this marriage?”\r\n\r\nBerenice’s eyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n“I see plainly that your object is to prejudice me in the eyes of Titus\r\nby recalling a deed of long ago. What I did then I do not now regret.”\r\n\r\n“That is a strange thing to say of infanticide.”\r\n\r\nBerenice gave a cold hard laugh that caused Vashti to shiver.\r\n\r\n“The exposure of infants is a custom so common among Romans that Titus\r\nwill scarcely regard it as a great crime.”\r\n\r\n“But _our_ law, princess, regards it as murder.”\r\n\r\n“And I regard my deed as a justifiable one, for in destroying the body\r\nof the infant I saved its soul. Polemo, who had seceded from Judaism,\r\nand had grown to hate both me and my religion, swore that he would\r\nbring up the child in his own Hellenic faith, and would teach it to\r\nhate the religion of its mother. I resolved to save it from such fate,\r\nand took the only possible way--I exposed it one winter’s night among\r\nthe snowy crags of Hermon.”\r\n\r\nVashti gave a faint little gasp--inaudible to Berenice--and her heart\r\nalmost ceased its beating. Not even when coming home on that dreadful\r\nnight to find Arad gone forever did she feel more horror than she\r\nfelt at this moment. To learn that she was the daughter of a woman so\r\nunnatural as to expose her own child to death! to learn that it was her\r\nown mother who had been pursuing her with a malignant aim! to learn\r\nthat she was a member of that Herodian house that had never ceased\r\npersecuting Christianity from its very beginning! to know that her\r\nmother was at that very moment living in open sin with the destroyer\r\nof her country!--all this rushed with her blood, nearly causing her to\r\nshriek aloud.\r\n\r\nJosephus continued his narration.\r\n\r\n“The loss of the child--for he had loved it as the apple of his\r\neye--threw Polemo into a fever, which, so it seems to me, crazed his\r\nbrain, for it left him animated by one passion only--a desire to be\r\nrevenged upon the woman who had wronged him.”\r\n\r\n“Thou liest,” interjected Berenice, “for in due course of time, he and\r\nI, as all men can testify, grew to be great friends.”\r\n\r\n“You were deceived, princess. He masked his hatred under a smiling\r\nguise the more effectually to conceal his purpose. Now, mark the result\r\nof your deed! It is true that it was decreed in the councils of the\r\nMost High that the city and the temple should perish, but the Most High\r\nmakes use of human instruments to work out His decrees; and yours,\r\nprincess, has been the hand that has wrought the ruin of Israel.”\r\n\r\nThere was in Josephus’ manner something so solemn and convincing, that\r\nall Berenice’s hauteur and defiance vanished, leaving her nearly as\r\npale and trembling as the daughter that was as yet unknown to her.\r\n\r\n“How mean you?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“It was our common religion, so Polemo erroneously argued, that had\r\ndestroyed his child; he would therefore destroy our religion.\r\n\r\n“Nothing was dearer to you, so you had once said to him, than the holy\r\ncity, and the holy temple; he resolved to bring destruction both upon\r\nthat city and upon that temple.\r\n\r\n“How could he effect it?\r\n\r\n“There was but one way; the Jewish people must be goaded into war, a\r\nwar in which their capital must sink in flames.\r\n\r\n“This is the key to Polemo’s frequent visits to Judæa; to his\r\nfriendship with successive procurators--Felix, Festus, Albinus. With\r\nthese, however, he failed to effect his purpose, but at last in Florus\r\nhe found the tool he wanted. While you, princess, were on one side of\r\nthat procurator, winning him to acts of clemency, Polemo was on the\r\nother, urging him to deeds of blood; all the provocative acts of Florus\r\nwere due to the secret, the wicked policy of the Pontic king.”\r\n\r\nThese words caused a deepening of Vashti’s horror. To think that she\r\nwas the daughter of a king so coldblooded as deliberately to plan the\r\nextirpation of a whole nation, and all, so it seemed, on her account!\r\n\r\nAt this point Titus intervened.\r\n\r\n“This secret history is doubtless interesting, but what hath it to do\r\nwith Beth-tamar?”\r\n\r\n“I am coming to it, O Cæsar. It chanced in course of time that the\r\nPrincess Berenice met my lord Crispus at a banquet at Antioch and\r\nbecame enamored of him.”\r\n\r\nBerenice gave a scornful laugh; but the statement was true, and her\r\nlaugh deceived no one. “Polemo suspected this. Now, he had already in\r\nmind selected the son of his friend, Cestius the Legate, to be his\r\nsuccessor in the sovereignty of Pontus, and it did not suit his policy\r\nthat Berenice should marry Crispus, and thus again wear the crown that\r\nshe had once despised. He therefore resolved to thwart her aim. While\r\nthinking how he might best succeed in this matter, he happened to\r\npay a visit to Jerusalem, and there, by a singular turn of destiny,\r\nhe saw one day in the temple-courts a maiden who immediately arrested\r\nhis attention from the marvelous resemblance she bore to his mother\r\nPythodoris in her youthful days. Avoiding the maiden herself, he made\r\ninquiries of others, and learned that her name was Vashti, and that she\r\nwas the ward of him who now addresses you. He sought me out with eager\r\nquestionings, and I was forced to admit that the supposed daughter\r\nof Hyrcanus was in reality a foundling, nor were proofs wanting to\r\nconvince him beyond all doubt that in Vashti he had found his daughter\r\nAthenaïs, long supposed by him to be dead.”\r\n\r\nA strange sound broke from Berenice; amazement caused her figure\r\nto stiffen into a rigid attitude; for a few moments she sat thus,\r\nmotionless and wordless; then slowly, mechanically, she turned her\r\nhead and looked at Vashti. And of all the looks that Vashti had ever\r\nreceived none frightened her more than this; it was a look without a\r\ntrace of maternal love--cold, disdainful, cruel; a look that said,\r\nas plainly as words could say, that she would never acknowledge the\r\nNazarene apostate as a daughter of hers.\r\n\r\n“Polemo, for reasons of his own, did not make himself known to his\r\ndaughter. Whether he now had any affection for her whom, as a babe,\r\nhe had idolized, it is hard to say; one thing became clear to him; he\r\nsaw in the daughter an instrument for the humiliation of the mother.\r\nIf he could persuade Crispus to marry Vashti, and to keep the matter\r\nhidden from the world, the fond, enamored Berenice would be pursuing\r\nCrispus for months in the vain endeavor to win him to her arms, while\r\nhe--Polemo--could look on in malicious enjoyment, as knowing that her\r\nwiles were foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\n“Such was Polemo’s reason for keeping the wedding a secret--a reason\r\nunknown to me at the time; I have learned it since from Zeno. Vashti,\r\ntoo, was required to keep the matter hidden, even from her adopted\r\nmother, Miriam. Vashti, being my ward, was compelled to take for\r\nher husband the man of my choice, and though she long resisted the\r\nnotion of wedding a heathen Roman, I overcame her scruples at last by\r\npersuading her that her intended bridegroom was far more virtuous than\r\nmany a Jew. She therefore accompanied me by night to Beth-tamar, not\r\nknowing that he who presided over these nuptials was her father, not\r\nknowing his name even, nor that she had been destined by him to wear\r\nthe crown of a queen.\r\n\r\n“All this was to come upon her later as a delightful surprise.\r\n\r\n“My story is all but finished. It was Polemo’s intention to stand\r\nbeside Berenice either upon Mount Olivet when the temple was burning,\r\nor at some palace window in Rome when the triumphal procession was\r\nsweeping past, carrying the sacred spoils of the temple--to stand\r\nbeside her and to tell her in fierce, exultant tones that all this was\r\n_his_ work; he would watch her agony; she was to be the victim of his\r\nlaughter, of his mockery, of his scorn!\r\n\r\n“But this supreme and thrilling moment of revenge--this triumph that he\r\nhad so long worked for, was not to be his; he died ere the day of his\r\nvengeance came.\r\n\r\n“Cæsar, my tale is said.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence in that chamber after Josephus had finished\r\nhis narration.\r\n\r\nTitus looked at Berenice as if desiring her to say something.\r\n\r\nThe breast of that princess was the seat of a wild tumult of contending\r\npassions, but among them there was neither pity nor love for her newly\r\nfound daughter.\r\n\r\n“It seems,” said she, with a superbly disdainful air, “it seems, if the\r\nstory of Josephus be true, that I am to be presented with a daughter,\r\nbut I care not for the gift. I should be a hypocrite were I to feign\r\nlove where love is not. No; I cast her away in infancy that thereby I\r\nmight save her soul; by becoming a Nazarene she has chosen to destroy\r\nher soul; let her still remain a castaway. Let her keep to her own path\r\nas I shall keep to mine. I have no daughter; that is my answer to her.”\r\n\r\nVashti was willing for reconcilement, but this cold repudiation kept\r\nher dumb. With divine pity in her eyes, she looked at her mother, and\r\nsighed.\r\n\r\nCrispus made reply for her.\r\n\r\n“Since such is your decision,” said he, “we will not seek to change it.\r\nCæsar, I salute you. Come, Vashti, let us be going.”\r\n\r\nAs the two arose to depart, Titus walked over to them, as if not\r\nwilling that Berenice should hear what he had to say.\r\n\r\n“My sire, Vespasian, knowing that you have been disappointed in the\r\nexpectation of the crown of Pontus, has offered you the thing that is\r\nmost like it--namely, the governorship of that province. Its people\r\nwill be delighted when they know that the wife of the new governor is\r\nthe granddaughter of the good queen Pythodoris.”\r\n\r\nBut Crispus had little desire for the honor; he would be more happy\r\nwith Vashti in his beautiful villa among the Sabine hills than in\r\npresiding over the destinies of the Pontic people. While thinking thus,\r\nhowever, he received from Vashti a wistful glance which seemed to be\r\nurging him to accept the post.\r\n\r\n“What, Vashti? Ambitious that I should sit in a curule chair?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” whispered she, “for if Crispus be ruler of Pontus there will\r\nalways be _one_ safe asylum for Christians.”\r\n\r\n“You speak wisely, little woman,” replied he; and, turning to Titus, he\r\nsaid, “Cæsar, I accept the post with all thankfulness.”\r\n\r\nBerenice watched the two as they quitted the Ivory Hall.\r\n\r\nShe never saw them again!\r\n\r\nAfter a brief visit to Jerusalem, where bishop Simeon joined the\r\nhands of the pair, Crispus, accompanied by his bride, set out for his\r\nprovince of Pontus, there to begin a long administration, whose wisdom\r\nand justice were to win golden opinions from all men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Berenice?\r\n\r\nThe Roman senate and the Roman people soon made short work of her dream\r\nof an imperial throne! Their anger at the thought of a Jewish empress\r\nwas so fiercely expressed that Titus, albeit with all reluctance, was\r\ncompelled to banish her from his presence.[40]\r\n\r\nScorned by the Romans because she came of the Jewish people; scorned by\r\nthe Jewish people because she had allied herself with a Roman; branded\r\nwith deserved infamy by the poet Juvenal;[41] eating out her heart over\r\nthe ignominious ending of her splendid ambition, Berenice passed into\r\na state of obscurity and oblivion, History failing to record the time,\r\nthe place, or the manner of her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n  1 The Talmud.\r\n\r\n  2 Told by the heathen Plutarch in his _Cessation of Oracles_.\r\n\r\n  3 Josephus.--_Vita_ 2.\r\n\r\n  4 Acts xxv. 16.\r\n\r\n  5 Greek Anthology.--I. 77.\r\n\r\n  6 Acts xxiii. 14.\r\n\r\n  7 Flaccus, pro-Consul of Asia, for example.--CICERO. _Pro Flacco._\r\n\r\n  8 The ancient usage in the Jerusalem synagogues of anathematizing\r\n    Christ and the Christians is said by some to have originated,\r\n    not with Simeon, but with his father Gamaliel, a statement\r\n    scarcely reconcilable with Acts v. 38.\r\n\r\n  9 A saying of Simeon’s, according to the Talmud.\r\n\r\n  10 The Talmud.\r\n\r\n  11 Jos.--_Bell.

At one\r\n  end a portion, elevated like a daïs and railed off like a chancel,\r\n  formed the _bema_ (the word had passed from the Greek into *the*\r\n  Syro-Chaldaic) or tribunal, where the judges sat *and* orators\r\n  pleaded.",
