History knows nothing of spontaneous generation; the\r\nchain of cause and effect is unbroken, and however modest be the\r\nscale on which an historical work is cast, the reader has a right to\r\nask that it should give him some idea, not only of what happened, but\r\nof why it happened. A catalogue of dates and names is as meaningless\r\nas the photograph of a crowd. In the following retrospect, I have\r\nattempted to trace the principal factors that worked towards Italian\r\nunity. The Liberation of Italy is a cycle waiting to be turned into an\r\nepic.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it presents the appearance of a series of detached\r\nepisodes, but the parts have an intimate connection with the whole,\r\nwhich, as time wears on, will constantly emerge into plainer light.\r\nEvery year brings with it the issue of documents, letters, memoirs,\r\nthat help to unravel the tangled threads in which this subject has\r\nbeen enveloped, and which have made it less generally understood than\r\nthe two other great struggles of the century, the American fight for\r\nthe Union, and the unification of Germany.\r\n\r\nI cannot too strongly state my indebtedness to the voluminous\r\nliterature which has grown up in Italy round the _Risorgimento_ since\r\nits completion; yet it must not be supposed that the witness of\r\ncontemporaries published from hour to hour, in every European tongue,\r\nwhile the events were going on, has become or will ever become\r\nvalueless. I have had access to a collection of these older writings,\r\nformed with much care between the years 1850-1870, and some\r\nauthorities that were wanting, I found in the library of Sir James\r\nHudson, given by him to Count Giuseppe Martinengo Cesaresco after he\r\nleft the British legation at Turin.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many books in which the affairs of Italy figure\r\nonly incidentally, which ought to be consulted by anyone who wishes to\r\nstudy the inner working of the Italian movement. Of such are Lord\r\nCastlereagh's _Despatches and Correspondence_, and the autobiographies\r\nof Prince Metternich and Count Beust.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have been helped in describing the events clearly, by the\r\nfact that I am familiar with almost all the places where they\r\noccurred, from the heights of Calatafimi to the unhappy rock of Lissa.\r\nWherever the language of the _Si_ sounds, we tread upon the history of\r\nthe Revolution that achieved what a great English orator once called,\r\n'the noblest work ever undertaken by man.'\r\n\r\nThe supreme interest of the re-casting of Italy arises from the new\r\nspectacle of a nation made one not by conquest but by consent. Above\r\nand beyond the other causes that contributed to the conclusion must\r\nalways be reckoned the gathering of an emotional wave, only comparable\r\nto the phenomena displayed by the mediæval religious revivals.\r\nSentiment, it is said, is what makes the real historical miracles. A\r\nwriter on Italian Liberation would be indeed misleading who failed to\r\ntake account of the passionate longing which stirred and swayed even\r\nthe most outwardly cold of those who took part in it, and nerved an\r\nentire people to heroic effort.\r\n\r\nSalò, Lago di Garda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nRESURGAM\r\n\r\nItaly from the Battle of Lodi to the Congress of Vienna\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE CARBONARI\r\n\r\nRevolutions in the Kingdom of Naples and in Piedmont--The Conspiracy\r\nagainst Charles Albert\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRISON AND SCAFFOLD\r\n\r\nPolitical Trials in Venetia and Lombardy--Risings in the South and\r\nCentre--Ciro Menotti\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nYOUNG ITALY\r\n\r\nAccession of Charles Albert--Mazzini's Unitarian Propaganda--The\r\nBrothers Bandiera\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE POPE LIBERATOR\r\n\r\nEvents leading to the Election of Pius IX.--The Petty Princes--Charles\r\nAlbert, Leopold and Ferdinand\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR OF REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nInsurrection in Sicily--The Austrians expelled from Milan and\r\nVenice--Charles Albert takes the Field--Withdrawal of the Pope and\r\nKing of Naples--Piedmont defeated--The Retreat\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL OF THRONES\r\n\r\nGaribaldi arrives--Venice under Manin--The Dissolution of the Temporal\r\nPower--Republics at Rome and Florence\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAT BAY\r\n\r\nNovara--Abdication of Charles Albert--Brescia crushed--French\r\nIntervention--The Fall of Rome--The Fall of Venice\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n'J'ATTENDS MON ASTRE'\r\n\r\nThe House of Savoy--A King who Keeps his Word--Sufferings of the\r\nLombards--Charles Albert's death\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF PIEDMONT\r\n\r\nRestoration of the Pope and Grand-Duke of Tuscany--Misrule at Naples--\r\nThe Struggle with the Church in Piedmont--The Crimean War\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPREMONITIONS OF THE STORM\r\n\r\nPisacane's Landing--Orsini's Attempt--The Compact of\r\nPlombières--Cavour's Triumph\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR LOMBARDY\r\n\r\nAustria declares War--Montebello--Garibaldi's Campaign--Palestro--\r\nMagenta--The Allies enter Milan--Ricasoli saves Italian Unity--\r\nAccession of Francis II.--Solferino--The Armistice of Villafranca\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHAT UNITY COST\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. and Cavour--The Cession of Savoy and Nice--Annexations\r\nin Central Italy\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH OF THE THOUSAND\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Expedition--Garibaldi at Marsala--Calatafimi--The Taking\r\nof Palermo--Milazzo--The Bourbons evacuate Sicily\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF THE WATERS\r\n\r\nGaribaldi's March on Naples--The Piedmontese in Umbria and the\r\nMarches--The Volturno.

To him it was a point of secondary interest that the Imperial\r\nLord happened to be bred beyond the Alps, that he was of Teutonic, not\r\nof Latin blood. If the Emperor brought the talisman of his authority\r\nto the banks of the Tiber, Italy would overcome the factions which\r\nrent her, and would not only rule herself, but lead mankind. Vast as\r\nthe vision was, Dante cannot be called presumptuous for having\r\nentertained it. The Rome of the Cæsars, the Rome of the Popes, had\r\neach transformed the world: Italy was transforming it for a third time\r\nat that moment by the spiritual awakening which, beginning with the\r\nRenaissance, led by inevitable steps to the Reformation. The great\r\nFlorentine poet had the right to dream that his country was invested\r\nwith a providential mission, that his people was a chosen people,\r\nwhich, by its own fault and by the fault of others, had lost its way,\r\nbut would find it again. Such was Dante's so-called Ghibelline\r\nprogramme--less Ghibelline than intensely and magnificently Italian.\r\nHis was a mind too mighty to be caged within the limits of partisan\r\nambitions. The same may be said of Machiavelli. He also imagined, or\r\nrather discerned in the future, a regenerate Italy under a single\r\nhead, and this, not the advancement of any particular man, was the\r\ngrand event he endeavoured to hasten. With the impatience of a heart\r\nconsumed by the single passion of patriotism, he conjured his\r\nfellow-countrymen to seize the first chance that presented itself,\r\npromising or unpromising, of reaching the goal. The concluding passage\r\nin the _Principe_ was meant as an exhortation; it reads as a prophecy.\r\n'We ought not therefore,' writes Machiavelli, 'to let this occasion\r\npass whereby, after so long waiting, Italy may behold the coming of a\r\nsaviour. Nor can I express with what love he would be received in all\r\nthose provinces which have suffered from the foreign inundations; with\r\nwhat thirst of vengeance, with what obstinate faith, with what\r\nworship, with what tears! What doors would be closed against him? What\r\npeople would deny him obedience? What jealousy would oppose him? What\r\nItalian would not do him honour? The barbarous dominion of the\r\nstranger stinks in the nostrils of all.'\r\n\r\nAnother man of genius, an Italian whom a fortuitous circumstance made\r\nthe citizen and the master of a country not his own, grasped both the\r\nvital necessity of unity from an Italian point of view, and the\r\ncertainty of its ultimate achievement. Napoleon's notes on the\r\nsubject, written at St Helena, sum up the whole question without\r\nrhetoric but with unanswerable logic:--'Italy is surrounded by the\r\nAlps and the sea. Her natural limits are defined with as much\r\nexactitude as if she were an island. Italy is only united to the\r\nContinent by 150 leagues of frontier, and these 150 leagues are\r\nfortified by the highest barrier that can be opposed to man. Italy,\r\nisolated between her natural limits, is destined to form a great and\r\npowerful nation. Italy is one nation; unity of customs, language and\r\nliterature must, within a period more or less distant, unite her\r\ninhabitants under one sole government. And Rome will, without the\r\nslightest doubt, be chosen by the Italians as their capital.'\r\n\r\nUnlike Dante and Machiavelli, who could only sow the seed, not gather\r\nthe fruit, the man who wrote these lines might have made them a\r\nreality. Had Napoleon wished to unite Italy--had he had the greatness\r\nof mind to proclaim Rome the capital of a free and independent\r\nstate instead of turning it into the chief town of a French\r\ndepartment--there was a time when he could plainly have done it.\r\nWhether redemption too easily won would have proved a gain or a loss\r\nin the long run to the populations welded together, not after their\r\nown long and laborious efforts, but by the sudden exercise of the will\r\nof a conqueror, is, of course, a different matter. The experiment was\r\nnot tried. Napoleon, whom the simple splendour of such a scheme ought\r\nto have fascinated, did a very poor thing instead of a very great one:\r\nhe divided Italy among his relations, keeping the lion's share for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's policy in Italy was permanently compromised by the\r\nabominable sale of Venice, with her two thousand years of freedom, to\r\nthe empire which, as no one knew better than he did, was the pivot of\r\nEuropean despotism. After that transaction he could never again come\r\nbefore the Italians with clean hands; they might for a season make him\r\ntheir idol, carried away by the intoxication of his fame; they could\r\nnever trust him in their inmost conscience. The ruinous consequences\r\nof the Treaty of Campo Formio only; ceased in 1866. The Venetians have\r\nbeen severely blamed, most of all by Italian historians, for making\r\nCampo Formio possible by opening the door to the French six months\r\nbefore. Napoleon could not have bartered away Venice if it had not\r\nbelonged to him. The reason that it belonged to him was that, on the\r\n12th of May 1797, the Grand Council committed political suicide by\r\ndissolving the old aristocratic form of government, in compliance with\r\na mere rumour, conveyed to them through the ignoble medium of a petty\r\nshopkeeper, that such was the wish of General Buonaparte. In\r\nextenuation of their fatal supineness, it may be urged that they felt\r\nthe inherent weakness of an oligarchy out of date; and in the second\r\nplace, that the victor of Lodi, the deliverer of Lombardy, then in the\r\nfirst flush of his scarcely tarnished glory, was a dazzling figure,\r\ncalculated indeed to turn men's heads. But, after all, the only really\r\nvalid excuse for them would have been that Venice lacked the means of\r\ndefence, and this was not the case. She had 14,000 regular troops,\r\n8000 marines, a good stock of guns--how well she might have resisted\r\nthe French, had they, which was probable, attacked her, was to be\r\nproved in 1849. Her people, moreover, that _basso popolo_ which\r\nnowhere in the world is more free from crime, more patient in\r\nsuffering, more intelligent and public-spirited than in Venice, was\r\nanxious and ready to resist; when the nobles offered themselves a\r\nsacrifice on the Gallic altar by welcoming the proposed democratic\r\ninstitutions, the populace, neither hoodwinked nor scared into\r\nhysterics, rose to the old cry of San Marco, and attempted a righteous\r\nreaction, which was only smothered when the treacherous introduction\r\nof French troops by night on board Venetian vessels settled the doom\r\nof Venice's independence.\r\n\r\n'Under all circumstances,' Napoleon wrote to the Venetian Municipality,\r\n'I shall do what lies in my power to prove to you my desire to see your\r\nliberty consolidated, and miserable Italy assume, at last, a glorious\r\nplace, free and independent of strangers.' On the 10th of the following\r\nOctober he made over Venice to Austria, sending as a parting word the\r\ncynical message to the Venetians 'that they were little fitted for\r\nliberty: if they were capable of appreciating it, and had the virtue\r\nnecessary for acquiring it well and good; existing circumstances gave\r\nthem an excellent opportunity of proving it.' At the time, the act of\r\nbetrayal was generally regarded as part of a well-considered plot laid\r\nby the French Directory, but it seems certain that it was not made known\r\nto that body before it was carried out, and that with Napoleon himself\r\nit was a sort of after-thought, sprung from the desire to patch up an\r\nimmediate peace with Austria on account of the appointment of Hoche to\r\nthe chief command of the army in Germany. The god to which he immolated\r\nVenice was the selfish fear lest another general should reap his German\r\nlaurels.\r\n\r\nVenice remained for eight years under the Austrians, who thereby\r\nobtained what, in flagrant perversion of the principles on which the\r\nCongress of Vienna professed to act, was accepted in 1815 as their\r\ntitle-deeds to its possession. Meanwhile, after the battle of\r\nAusterlitz, the city of the sea was tossed back to Napoleon, who\r\nincorporated it in the newly-created kingdom of Italy, which no more\r\ncorresponded to its name than did the Gothic kingdom of which he\r\narrogated to himself the heirship, when, placing the Iron Crown of\r\nTheodolinda upon his brow, he uttered the celebrated phrase: 'Dieu me\r\nl'a donnée, gare à qui la touche.'\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to write a history of French supremacy in Italy,\r\nbut several points connected with it must be glanced at, because,\r\nwithout bearing them in mind, it is impossible to understand the\r\nevents which followed. The viceroyalty of Eugène Beauharnais in North\r\nItaly, and the government of Joseph Buonaparte, and afterwards of\r\nJoachim Murat, in the South, brought much that was an improvement on\r\nwhat had gone before: there were better laws, a better administration,\r\na quickening of intelligence. 'The French have done much for the\r\nregeneration of Italy,' wrote an English observer in 1810; 'they have\r\ndestroyed the prejudices of the inhabitants of the small states of\r\nUpper Italy by uniting them; they have done away with the Pope; they\r\nhave made them soldiers.' But there was the reverse side of the medal:\r\nthe absence everywhere of the national spirit which alone could have\r\nconsolidated the new _régime_ on a firm basis; the danger which the\r\nlanguage ran of losing its purity by the introduction of Gallicisms;\r\nthe shameless robbery of pictures, statues, and national heirlooms of\r\nevery kind for the replenishment of French museums; the bad impression\r\nleft in the country districts by the abuses committed by the French\r\nsoldiery on their first descent, and kept alive by the blood-tax\r\nlevied in the persons of thousands of Italian conscripts sent to die,\r\nnobody knew where or why; the fields untilled, and Rachel weeping for\r\nher children: all these elements combined in rendering it difficult\r\nfor the governments established under French auspices to survive the\r\ndownfall of the man to whose sword they owed their existence. Their\r\ndissolution was precipitated, however, by the discordant action of\r\nMurat and Eugène Beauharnais. Had these two pulled together, whatever\r\nthe issue was it would have differed in much from what actually\r\nhappened. Murat was jealous of Eugène, and did not love his\r\nbrother-in-law, who had annoyed and thwarted him through his whole\r\nreign; he was uneasy about his Neapolitan throne, and, in all\r\nlikelihood, was already dreaming of acquiring the crown of an\r\nindependent Italy. Throwing off his allegiance to Napoleon, he\r\nimagined the vain thing that he might gain his object by taking sides\r\nwith the Austrians. It must be remembered that there was a time when\r\nthe Allied Powers had distinctly contemplated Italian independence as\r\na dyke to France, and there were people foolish enough to think that\r\nAustria, now she felt herself as strong as she had then felt weak,\r\nwould consent to such a plan. Liberators, self-called, were absolutely\r\nswarming in Italy; Lord William Bentinck was promising entire\r\nemancipation from Leghorn; the Austrian and English allies in Romagna\r\nransacked the dictionary for expressions in praise of liberty; an\r\nEnglish officer was made the mouthpiece for the lying assurance of the\r\nAustrian Emperor Francis, that he had no intention of re-asserting any\r\nclaims to the possession of Lombardy or Venetia.\r\n\r\nIn 1814, Napoleon empowered Prince Eugène to adopt whatever attitude\r\nhe thought best fitted to make head against Austria; for himself, he\r\nresigned the Iron Crown, and his Italian soldiers were freed from\r\ntheir oaths. It was not, therefore, Eugene's loyal scruples which\r\nprevented him from throwing down a grand stake when he led his 60,000\r\nmen to the attack. It was want of genius, or of what would have done\r\ninstead, a flash of genuine enthusiasm for the Italian idea. In place\r\nof appealing to all Italians to unite in winning a country, he\r\nappealed to one sentiment only, fidelity to Napoleon, which no longer\r\nwoke any echo in the hearts of a population that had grown more and\r\nmore to associate the name of the Emperor with exactions which never\r\ncame to an end, and with wars which had not now even the merit of\r\nbeing successful. It is estimated that although the Italian troops\r\namply proved the truth of Alfieri's maxim, that 'the plant man is more\r\nvigorous in Italy than elsewhere,' by bearing the hardships and\r\nresisting the cold in Russia better than the soldiers of any other\r\nnationality, nevertheless 26,000 Italians were lost in the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow. That happened a year ago. Exhausted patience got the\r\nbetter of judgment; in April 1814, the Milanese committed the\r\nirremediable error of revolting against their Viceroy, who commanded\r\nthe only army which could still save Italy: the pent-up passions of a\r\nlong period broke loose, the peasants from the country, who had always\r\nhated the French, flooded the streets of Milan, and allying themselves\r\nunimpeded with the dregs of the townsfolk, they murdered with great\r\nbrutality General Prina, the Minister of Finance, whose remarkable\r\nabilities had been devoted towards raising funds for the Imperial\r\nExchequer. Personally incorruptible, Prina was looked upon as the\r\ngeneral representative of French voracity; he met his death with the\r\nutmost calmness, only praying that he might be the last victim. No one\r\nelse was, in fact, killed, and next day quiet was resumed, but the\r\naffair had another victim--Italy. You cannot change horses when you\r\nare crossing a stream. Prince Eugène was in Mantua with a fine army,\r\npractically intact, though it had suffered some slight reverses; the\r\nfortress was believed to be impregnable; by merely waiting, Eugene\r\nmight, if nothing else, have exacted favourable terms. But the news of\r\nPrina's murder, and the blow dealt at his own authority in Milan,\r\ncaused him to give over the fortress and the army to the Austrians\r\nwithout more ado; an act which looked like revenge, but it was most\r\nlikely prompted by moral cowardice. The capitulation signed with\r\nField-Marshal Bellegarde on the 23rd of April, so exasperated the army\r\nthat the officers in command of the garrison decided to arrest Eugene,\r\nbut it was found that he was already on his way to Germany, taking\r\nwith him his treasure, in accordance with a secret agreement entered\r\ninto with the Austrian Field-Marshal. Such was the end to the Italian\r\ncareer of Eugène Beauharnais.\r\n\r\nFor the _Beau Sabreur_ another ending was in store. Back on Napoleon's\r\nside in 1815, his Austrian allies having given him plenty of reason\r\nfor suspecting their sincerity, he issued from Rimini, on the 30th of\r\nMarch, the proclamation of an independent Italy from the Alps to\r\nSicily. There was no popular reply to his call. Italy, prostrate and\r\nimpoverished, was unequal to a great resolve. The Napoleonic legend\r\nwas not only dead, but buried; Napoleon had literally no friends left\r\nin Italy except those of his old soldiers who had managed to get back\r\nto their homes, many of them deprived of an arm or a leg, but so\r\ntoughened that they lived to great ages. These cherished to their last\r\nhour the worship of their Captain, which it was his highest gift to be\r\nable to inspire. 'I have that feeling for him still, that if he were\r\nto rise from the dead I should go to him, if I could, wherever he\r\nwas,' said the old conscript Emmanuele Gaminara of Genoa, who died at\r\nnearly a hundred in a Norfolk village in 1892: the last, perhaps, of\r\nthe Italian veterans, and the type of them all.\r\n\r\nBut a few scattered invalids do not make a nation, and the Italian\r\nnation in 1815 had not the least wish to support any one who came in\r\nthe name of Napoleon. So Murat failed without even raising a strong\r\ncurrent of sympathy. Beaten by the Austrians at Tolentino on the 3rd\r\nof May, he retreated with his shattered army. In the last desperate\r\nmoment, he issued the constitution which he ought to have granted\r\nyears before. Nothing could be of any avail now; his admirable Queen,\r\nthe best of all the House of Buonaparte, surrendered Naples to the\r\nEnglish admiral; and Murat, harried by a crushing Austrian force,\r\nrenounced his kingdom on the 30th of May. After Waterloo, when a price\r\nwas set on his head in France, he meditated one more forlorn hope;\r\nbut, deserted by the treachery of his few followers, and driven out of\r\nhis course by the violence of the waves, he was thrown on the coast of\r\nCalabria with only twenty-six men, and was shot by order of Ferdinand\r\nof Naples, who especially directed that he should be only allowed\r\nhalf-an-hour for his religious duties after sentence had been\r\ndelivered by the mock court-martial. His dauntless courage did not\r\ndesert him: he died like a soldier. It was a better end for an Italian\r\nprince than escaping with money-bags to Germany. Great as were Murat's\r\nfaults, an Italian should remember that it was he who first took up\r\narms to the cry which was later to redeem Italy: independence from\r\nAlps to sea; and if he stand on the ill-omened shore of Pizzo, he\r\nneed not refuse to uncover his head in silence.\r\n\r\nWhen Mantua surrendered, the Milanese sent a deputation to Paris with\r\na view of securing for Lombardy the position of an independent kingdom\r\nunder an Austrian prince. They hoped to obtain the first by\r\nacquiescing in the second. They were aroused from their unheroic\r\nillusions with startling rapidity. Lord Castlereagh, to whom they went\r\nfirst (for they fancied that the English were interested in liberty),\r\nreferred them 'to their master, the Austrian Emperor.' The Emperor\r\nFrancis replied to their memorial that Lombardy was his by right of\r\nconquest; they would hear soon enough at Milan what orders he had to\r\ngive them. Even after that, the distracted Lombards hoped that the\r\nEnglish at Genoa would befriend them. All uncertainty ceased on the\r\n23rd of May 1814, when Field-Marshal Bellegarde formally took\r\npossession of Lombardy on behalf of his Sovereign, dissolved the\r\nElectoral Colleges, and proclaimed himself Regent. There was no\r\nquestion of reviving the conditions under which Austria ruled Lombardy\r\nwhile there was still a German Empire: conditions which, though\r\ndespotic in theory, were comparatively easy-going in practice, and did\r\nnot exclude the native element from the administration. Henceforth the\r\ndespotism was pure and simple; for Italians to even think of politics\r\nwas an act of high treason.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that a British army ultimately sent to Spain\r\nwas intended for Italy,[1] but its destination was changed because the\r\nItalians showed so little disposition to rise against Napoleon. The\r\nEnglish Government was continually advised by its agents in Italy to\r\nmake Sicily, which was wholly in its power, the _point d'appùi_ for a\r\nreally great intervention in the destinies of the peninsula. 'The\r\ngrand end of all the operations in the Mediterranean,' wrote one of\r\nLord Castlereagh's correspondents, 'is the emancipation of Italy, and\r\nits union in one great state.' Lord William Bentinck urged that if\r\nSicily were reunited to Naples under the Bourbons, liberty,\r\nestablished there by his own incredible efforts, would be crushed, and\r\nthe King would wreck vengeance on the Constitution and its supporters.\r\nUniversal terror, he said, was felt at 'the unforgiving temper of\r\ntheir Majesties.' He strongly supported a course proposed for her own\r\nreasons by Queen Caroline: the purchase of Sicily by the English\r\nGovernment which could make it 'not only the model but the instrument\r\nof Italian independence.'\r\n\r\nThis way of talking was not confined to private despatches, and it was\r\nno wonder if the Italians were disappointed when they found that\r\nEngland declined to plead their cause with the Allies in Paris, and\r\nafterwards at Vienna. When charged directly with breach of faith\r\nbefore the House of Commons, Lord Castlereagh said that Austria, being\r\n'in truth the great hinge on which the fate of mankind must ultimately\r\ndepend,' had to be paid (this was exactly the sense, though not the\r\nform, of his defence) by letting her do what she liked with Italy.\r\nThere is a certain brutal straightforwardness in the line of argument.\r\nLord Castlereagh did not say that independence was not a good thing.\r\nHe had tried to obtain it for Poland and had failed; he had not tried\r\nto obtain it for Italy, because he was afraid of offending Austria. At\r\nleast he had the courage to tell the truth, and did not prate about\r\nthe felicity of being subjects of the Austrian Emperor, as many\r\nEnglish partisans of Austria prated in days to come.\r\n\r\nThe political map of Italy in the summer of 1814 showed the Pope (Pius\r\nVII.) reinstated in Rome, Victor Emmanuel I. at Turin, Ferdinand III.\r\nof Hapsburg-Lorraine in Tuscany, the Genoese Republic for the moment\r\nrestored by the English, Parma and Piacenza assigned to the Empress\r\nMarie-Louise, and Modena to the Austrian Archduke Francis, who was\r\nheir through the female line to the last of the Estes. Murat was still\r\nat Naples, Ferdinand IV. in Sicily, Austria acknowledged supreme in\r\nLombardy and Venetia, and the island of Elba ironically handed over to\r\nNapoleon. These were the chief features, so far as Italy was\r\nconcerned, of the Treaty of Paris, signed on the 30th of May 1814.\r\nNext year the Congress of Vienna modified the arrangement by providing\r\nthat the Spanish Infanta Maria Louisa, on whom had been bestowed the\r\nex-republic of Lucca, should have the reversion of Parma and Piacenza,\r\nwhile Lucca was to go in the end to Tuscany. Murat having been\r\ndestroyed, the Neapolitan Bourbons recovered all their old\r\npossessions. San Marino and Monaco were graciously recognised as\r\nindependent, which brought the number of Italian states up to ten. The\r\nSardinian monarchy received back the part of Savoy which by the Treaty\r\nof Paris had been reserved to France. It was also offered a splendid\r\nand unexpected gift--Genoa.\r\n\r\nLord William Bentinck entered Genoa by a convention concluded with the\r\nauthorities on the 18th of April 1814. A naval demonstration following\r\nan ably-conducted operation, by which Bentinck's hybrid force of\r\nGreeks and Calabrese, with a handful of English, became master of the\r\ntwo principal forts, hastened this conclusion, but the Genoese had no\r\nreluctance to open their gates to the English commander, who inspired\r\nthem with the fullest confidence. He came invested with the halo of a\r\nconstitution-maker-under-difficulties; it was known that he had\r\nstopped at nothing in carrying out his mission in Sicily; not even at\r\ngetting rid of the Queen, who found in Bentinck the Nemesis for having\r\nled a greater Englishman to stain his fame in the roads of Naples.\r\nDriven rather than persuaded to leave Sicily, Marie Antoinette's\r\nsister encountered so frightful a sea voyage that she died soon after\r\njoining her relations at Vienna. Lord William had acquired the art of\r\nwriting the finest appeals to the love of freedom; a collection of his\r\nmanifestoes would serve as handy-book to anyone instructed to stir up\r\nan oppressed nationality. He immediately gave the Genoese some\r\nspecimens of his skill as a writer, and by granting them at once a\r\nprovisional constitution, he dispelled all doubts about the future\r\nrecognition of their republic. What was not, therefore, their dismay,\r\nwhen they were suddenly informed of the decision of the Holy Alliance\r\nto make a present of them to the people whom, of all others, they\r\nprobably disliked the most. Italians had not ceased yet from reserving\r\ntheir best aversion for their nearest neighbours.\r\n\r\nBentinck did not mean to deceive; perhaps he thought that by going\r\nbeyond the letter of his instructions he should draw his government\r\nafter him. That he did, in effect, deceive, cannot be denied; even\r\nLord Castlereagh, while necessarily refusing to admit that definite\r\npromises had been made, yet allowed that, 'Of course he would have\r\nbeen glad if the proclamation issued to the Genoese had been more\r\nprecisely worded.' The motive of the determination to sacrifice the\r\nrepublic was, he said, 'a sincere conviction of the necessity of a\r\nbarrier between France and Italy, which ought to be made effectual on\r\nthe side of Piedmont. The object was to commit the defence of the Alps\r\nand of the great road leading round them by the Gulf of Genoa, between\r\nFrance and Italy, to the same power to which it had formerly been\r\nentrusted. On that principle, the question relating to Genoa had been\r\nentertained and decided upon by the allied sovereigns. It was not\r\nresolved upon because any particular state had unworthy or sordid\r\nviews, or from any interest or feeling in favour of the King of\r\nSardinia, but solely to make him, as far as was necessary, the\r\ninstrument of the general policy of Europe.'\r\n\r\nA better defence might have been made. Piedmont was destined to serve\r\nas a bulwark, not so much against France, which for the time was not\r\nto be feared, as against Austria, absolute except for the subalpine\r\nkingdom in all Italy. But this belongs to the shaping of rough-hewn\r\nends, which is in higher hands than those of English ministers. The\r\nends then looked very rough-hewn.\r\n\r\nPiedmont was a hotbed of reaction and bigotry. True, she had a history\r\ndiffering vastly from that of the other Italian states, but the facts\r\nof the hour presented her in a most unattractive light. The Genoese\r\nfelt the keenest heart-burnings in submitting to a decision in which\r\nthey had no voice, and which came to them as a mandate of political\r\nextinction from the same powers that confirmed the sentence of death\r\non Genoa's ancient and glorious rival. The seeds were laid of\r\ndisaffection, always smouldering among the Genoese, till Piedmont's\r\nking became King of Italy. It might almost be said that the\r\nreconciliation was not consummated till the day when the heir and\r\nnamesake of Humbert of the White Hands received the squadrons of\r\nEurope in the harbour of Genoa, and the proud republican city showed\r\nwhat a welcome she had prepared for her sovereign of the Savoy race.\r\n\r\nAfter the Congress of Vienna finished its labours, there were, as has\r\nbeen remarked, ten states in Italy, but out of Sardinia (whose\r\nsubjugation Prince Metternich esteemed a mere matter of time) there\r\nwas one master. The authority of the Emperor Francis was practically\r\nas undisputed from Venice to the Bay of Naples as it was in the Grand\r\nDuchy of Austria. The Austrians garrisoned Piacenza, Ferrara and\r\nCommacchio; Austrian princes reigned in Tuscany, Parma, Modena and\r\nLucca; the King of Naples, who paid Austria twenty-six million francs\r\nfor getting back his throne, thankfully agreed to support a German\r\narmy to protect him against his subjects. In the secret treaty\r\nconcluded between himself and the Emperor of Austria, it was\r\nstipulated that the King of the Two Sicilies should not introduce into\r\nhis government any principles irreconcilable with those adopted by His\r\nImperial Majesty in the government of his Italian provinces. As for\r\nthe Roman States, Austria reckoned on her influence in always\r\nsecuring the election of a Pope who would give her no trouble. Seeing\r\nherself without rivals and all-powerful, she deemed her position\r\nunassailable. She forgot that, by giving Italy an unity of misery, she\r\nwas preparing the way for another unity. Common hatred engendered\r\ncommon love; common sufferings led on to a common effort. If some\r\nprejudices passed away under the Napoleonic rule, many more still\r\nremained, and possibly, to eradicate so old an evil, no cure less\r\ndrastic than universal servitude would have sufficed. Italians felt\r\nfor the first time what before only the greatest among them had\r\nfelt--that they were brothers in one household, children of one mother\r\nwhom they were bound to redeem. Jealousies and millennial feuds died\r\nout; the intense municipal spirit which, imperfect as it was, had yet\r\nin it precious political germs, widened into patriotism. Italy was\r\nre-born.\r\n\r\nBlack, however, was the present outlook. Total commercial stagnation\r\nand famine increased the sentiment of unmitigated hopelessness which\r\nspread through the land. The poet Monti, who, alas! sang for bread the\r\nfestival songs of the Austrians as he had sung those of Napoleon, said\r\nin private to an Englishman who asked him why he did not give his\r\nvoice to the liberties of his country which he desired, though he did\r\nnot expect to see them: 'It would be _vox clamantis in deserto_;\r\nbesides, how can the grievances of Italy be made known? No one dares\r\nto write--scarcely to think--politics; if truth is to be told, it must\r\nbe told by the English; England is the only tribunal yet open to the\r\ncomplaints of Europe.' A greater poet and nobler man, Ugo Foscolo, had\r\nbut lately uttered a wail still more despondent: 'Italy will soon be\r\nnothing but a lifeless carcass, and her generous sons should only\r\nweep in silence without the impotent complaints and mutual\r\nrecriminations of slaves.' That as patriotic a heart as ever beat\r\nshould have been afflicted to this point by the canker of despair\r\ntells of the quagmire--not only political but spiritual--into which\r\nItaly was sunk. The first thing needful was to restore the people to\r\nconsciousness, to animation of some sort, it did not matter what, so\r\nit were a sign of life. Foscolo himself, who impressed on what he\r\nwrote his own proud and scornful temperament, almost savage in its\r\nindependence, fired his countrymen to better things than the\r\ndespairing inertia which he preached. Few works have had more effect\r\nthan his _Letters of Jacobo Ortis_. As often happens with books which\r\nstrongly move contemporaries, the reader may wonder now what was the\r\nsecret of its power, but if the form and sentiment of the Italian\r\n_Werther_ strike us as antiquated, the intense, though melancholy\r\npatriotism that pervades it explains the excitement it caused when\r\npatriotism was a statutory offence. Such mutilated copies as were\r\nallowed to pass by the censor were eagerly sought; the young read it,\r\nwomen read it--who so rarely read--the mothers of the fighters of\r\nto-morrow. Foscolo's life gave force to his words: when all were\r\nflattering Napoleon, he had reminded him that no man can be rightly\r\npraised till he is dead, and that his one sure way of winning the\r\npraise of posterity was to establish the independence of Italy. The\r\nwarning was contained in a 'discourse' which Foscolo afterwards\r\nprinted with the motto from Sophocles: 'My soul groans for my country,\r\nfor myself and for thee.' Sooner than live under the Austrians, he\r\nwent into voluntary exile, and finally took refuge in England, where\r\nhe was the _fêted_ lion of a season, and then forgotten, and left\r\nalmost without the necessaries of life. No one was much to blame;\r\nFoscolo was born to misunderstand and to be misunderstood; he hid\r\nhimself to hide his poverty, which, had it been known, might have been\r\nalleviated. His individual tragedy seemed a part of the universal\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nWith Foscolo, his literary predecessor Alfieri must be mentioned as\r\nhaving helped in rekindling the embers, of patriotic feeling, because,\r\nthough dead, he spoke; and his plays, one of which was prophetically\r\ndedicated _al libero Popolo Italiano_, had never been so much read.\r\nThe _Misogallo_, published for the first time after the fall of\r\nNapoleon, though aimed at the French, served equally well as an\r\nonslaught on every foreign dominion or even moral or intellectual\r\ninfluence. 'Shall _we_ learn liberty of the Gauls, _we_ who taught\r\nevery lofty thing to others?' was a healthy remonstrance to a race\r\nthat had lost faith in itself; and the Austrians were wise in\r\ndiscountenancing the sale of a work that contained the line which gave\r\na watchword to the future:--\r\n\r\n      _Schiavi or siam si; ma schiavi almen frementi_.\r\n\r\nLike Foscolo's, Alfieri's life was a lesson in independence: angry at\r\nthe scant measure of freedom in Piedmont, he could never be induced to\r\ngo near his sovereign till Charles Emmanuel was staying at Florence as\r\na proscript. Then the poet went to pay his respects to him, and was\r\nreceived with the good-humoured banter: 'Well, Signor Conte, here am\r\nI, a king, in the condition you would like to see them all.'\r\n\r\nAgainst the classical, not to say pagan, leanings of these two poets,\r\na reaction set in with Alessandro Manzoni, the founder of Italian\r\nRomanticism, to which he gave an aspect differing from that which the\r\nsame movement wore in France, because he was an ardent Catholic at a\r\ntime when Christianity had almost the charm of novelty. His religious\r\noutpourings combine the fervour of the Middle Ages with modern\r\nexpansion, and he freed the Italian language from pedantic\r\nrestrictions without impairing its dignity. It was once the fashion to\r\ninveigh against Manzoni for, as it was said, inculcating resignation;\r\nbut he did nothing of the kind. As a young man he had sung of the\r\nItalians as 'Figli tutti d'un solo Riscatto,' and though he was not of\r\nthose who fight either with the sword or the pen, yet that 'Riscatto'\r\nwas the dream of his youth and manhood, and the joy of his old age.\r\nHis gentleness was never contaminated by servility, and the love for\r\nhis country, profound if placid, which appears in every line of his\r\nwritings, appealed to a class that could not be reached by fiery\r\nturbulence of thought.\r\n\r\nIn an age when newspapers have taken the place of books, it may seem\r\nstrange to ascribe any serious effect to the works of poets and\r\nromancists; but in the Italy of that date there were no newspapers to\r\nspeak of; the ordinary channels of opinion were blocked up. Books were\r\nstill not only read, but discussed and thought over, and every slight\r\nallusion to the times was instantly applied. In the prevailing\r\nlistlessness, the mere fact of increased mental activity was of\r\nimportance. A spark of genius does much to raise a nation. It is in\r\nitself the incontrovertible proof that the race lives: a dead people\r\ndoes not produce men of genius. Whatever awakes one part of the\r\nintelligence reacts on all its parts. You cannot lift, any more than\r\nyou can degrade, the heart of man piecemeal. In this sense not\r\nliterature only but also music helped, who can say how effectually, to\r\nbring Italy back to life. The land was refreshed by a flood of purely\r\nnational song, full of the laughter and the tears of Italian\r\ncharacter, of the sunshine and the storms of Italian nature. Music,\r\nthe only art uncageable as the human soul, descended as a gift from\r\nheaven upon the people whose articulate utterance was stifled. And\r\n\r\n   ... No speech may evince\r\n  Feeling like music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE CARBONARI\r\n\r\n1815-1821\r\n\r\nRevolutions in the Kingdom of Naples and in Piedmont--The Conspiracy\r\nagainst Charles Albert.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering what the state of the country was after 1815, and how\r\napparently inexhaustible were the resources of the Empire of which the\r\npetty princes of the peninsula were but puppets, it is remarkable that\r\npolitical agitation, with a view to reversing the decisions of Vienna,\r\nshould have begun so soon, and on so large a scale. Not that the\r\nnation, as a whole, was yet prepared to move; every revolution, till\r\n1848, was partial in the sense that the mass of the people stood\r\naloof, because unconvinced of the possibility of loosening their\r\nchains. But, during that long succession of years, the number of\r\nItalians ready to embark on enterprises of the most desperate\r\ncharacter, accounting as nothing the smallness of the chance of\r\nsuccess, seems enormous when the risks they ran and the difficulties\r\nthey faced are fully recognised. Among the means which were effective\r\nin first rousing Italy from her lethargy, and in fostering the will to\r\nacquire her independence at all costs, the secret society of the\r\nCarbonari undoubtedly occupies the front rank. The Carbonari acted in\r\ntwo ways; by what they did and by what they caused to be done by\r\nothers who were outside their society, and perhaps unfavourable to it,\r\nbut who were none the less sensible of the pressure it exercised. The\r\norigin of Carbonarism has been sought in vain; as a specimen of the\r\nchildish fables that once passed for its history may be noticed the\r\nlegend that Francis I. of France once stumbled on a charcoal burner's\r\nhut when hunting 'on the frontiers of his kingdom next to Scotland,'\r\nand was initiated into the rites similar to those in use among the\r\nsectaries of the nineteenth century. Those rites referred to vengeance\r\nwhich was to be taken on the wolf that slew the lamb; the wolf\r\nstanding for tyrants and oppressors, and the lamb for Jesus Christ,\r\nthe sinless victim, by whom all the oppressed were represented. The\r\nCarbonari themselves generally believed that they were heirs to an\r\norganisation started in Germany before the eleventh century, under the\r\nname of the Faith of the Kohlen-Brenners, of which Theobald de Brie,\r\nwho was afterwards canonised, was a member. Theobald was adopted as\r\npatron saint of the modern society, and his fancied portrait figured\r\nin all the lodges. That any weight should have been attached to these\r\npretensions to antiquity may appear strange to us, as it certainly did\r\nnot matter whether an association bent on the liberation of Italy had\r\nor had not existed in German forests eight hundred years before; age\r\nand mystery, however, have a great popular attraction, the first as an\r\nobject of reverence, the second as food for curiosity with the\r\nprofane, and a bond of union among the initiated. The religious\r\nsymbolism of the Carbonari, their oaths and ceremonies, and the axes,\r\nblocks and other furniture of the initiatory chamber, were well\r\ncalculated to impress the poorer and more ignorant and excitable of\r\nthe brethren. The Vatican affected to believe that Carbonarism was an\r\noffshoot of Freemasonry, but, in spite of sundry points of\r\nresemblance, such as the engagements of mutual help assumed by\r\nmembers, there seems to have been no real connection between the two.\r\nPolitical Freemasonry remained somewhat of an exotic in Italy, and was\r\ninclined to regard France as its centre. As far as can be ascertained,\r\nit gave a general support to Napoleon, while Carbonarism rejected\r\nevery foreign yoke. The practical aims of the Carbonari may be summed\r\nup in two words: freedom and independence. From the first they had the\r\npenetration to grasp the fact that independence, even if obtained,\r\ncould not be preserved without freedom; but though their predilections\r\nwere theoretically republican, they did not make a particular form of\r\ngovernment a matter of principle. Nor were they agreed in a definite\r\nadvocacy of the unity of Italy.\r\n\r\nA Genoese of the name of Malghella, who was Murat's Minister of\r\nPolice, was the first person to give a powerful impetus to\r\nCarbonarism, of which he has even been called the inventor, but the\r\ninference goes too far. Malghella ended miserably; after the fall of\r\nMurat he was arrested by the Austrians, who consigned him as a new\r\nsubject to the Sardinian Government, which immediately put him in\r\nprison. His name is hardly known, but no Italian of his time worked\r\nmore assiduously, or in some respects more intelligently, for the\r\nemancipation of Italy. Whatever was truly Italian in Murat's policy\r\nmust be mainly attributed to him. As early as 1813 he urged the King\r\nto declare himself frankly for independence, and to grant a\r\nconstitution to his Neapolitan subjects. But Malghella did not find\r\nthe destined saviour of Italy in Murat; his one lasting work was to\r\nestablish Carbonarism on so strong a basis that, when the Bourbons\r\nreturned, there were thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of\r\nCarbonari in all parts of the realm. The discovery was not a pleasant\r\none to the restored rulers, and the Prince of Canosa, the new Minister\r\nof Police, thought to counteract the evil done by his predecessor by\r\nsetting up an abominable secret society called the Calderai del\r\nContrapeso (Braziers of the Counterpoise), principally recruited from\r\nthe refuse of the people, lazzaroni, bandits and let-out convicts, who\r\nwere provided by Government with 20,000 muskets, and were sworn to\r\nexterminate all enemies of the Church of Rome, whether Jansenists,\r\nFreemasons or Carbonari. This association committed some horrible\r\nexcesses, but otherwise it had no results. The Carbonari closed in\r\ntheir ranks, and learnt to observe more strictly their rules of\r\nsecrecy. From the kingdom of Naples, Carbonarism spread to the Roman\r\nstates, and found a congenial soil in Romagna, which became the focus\r\nwhence it spread over the rest of Italy. It was natural that it should\r\ntake the colour, more or less, of the places where it grew. In\r\nRomagna, where political assassination is in the blood of the people,\r\na dagger was substituted for the symbolical woodman's axe in the\r\ninitiatory rites. It was probably only in Romagna that the\r\nconventional threat against informers was often carried out. The\r\nRomagnols invested Carbonarism with the wild intensity of their own\r\ntemperament, resolute even to crime, but capable of supreme impersonal\r\nenthusiasm. The ferment of expectancy that prevailed in Romagna is\r\nreflected in the Letters and Journals of Lord Byron, whom young Count\r\nPietro Gamba made a Carbonaro, and who looked forward to seeing the\r\nItalians send the barbarians of all nations back to their own dens, as\r\nto the most interesting spectacle and moment in existence. His lower\r\napartments, he writes, were full of the bayonets, fusils and\r\ncartridges of his Carbonari cronies; 'I suppose that they consider me\r\nas a dépôt, to be sacrificed in case of accidents. It is no great\r\nmatter, supposing that Italy could be liberated, who or what is\r\nsacrificed. It is a grand object--the very poetry of politics. Only\r\nthink--free Italy!!! Why, there has been nothing like it since the\r\ndays of Augustus.'\r\n\r\nThe movement on which such great hopes were set was to begin in the\r\nkingdom of Naples in the spring of 1820. The concession of the\r\nhard-won Spanish Constitution in the month of March encouraged the\r\nNeapolitans to believe that they might get a like boon from their own\r\nKing if they directed all the forces at their command to this single\r\nend. To avoid being compromised, they sought rather to dissociate\r\nthemselves from the patriots of other parts of Italy than to\r\nco-operate with them in an united effort. The Carbonari of the\r\nNeapolitan kingdom, who were the entire authors of the revolution,\r\nwhich, after many unfortunate delays, broke out on the 1st of July,\r\nhad good cause for thinking that they were in a position to dictate\r\nterms; the mistake they made was to suppose that a charter conceded by\r\na Bourbon of Naples could ever be worth the paper on which it was\r\nwritten. Not only among the people, but in the army the Carbonari had\r\nthousands of followers on whom they could rely, and several whole\r\nregiments were only waiting their orders to rise in open revolt. The\r\nscheme was to take possession of the persons of the King and the royal\r\nfamily, and retain them as hostages till the Constitution was granted.\r\nSuch extreme measures were not necessary. The standard of rebellion\r\nwas raised at Monteforte by two officers named Morelli and Silvati,\r\nwho had brought over a troop of cavalry from Nola, and by the priest\r\nMenechini. In all Neapolitan insurrections there was sure to be a\r\npriest; the Neapolitan Church, much though there is to be laid to its\r\naccount, must be admitted to have frequently shown sympathy with the\r\npopular side. Menechini enjoyed an immense, if brief, popularity which\r\nhe used to allay the anger of the mob and to procure the safety of\r\nobnoxious persons. The King sent two generals and a body of troops\r\nagainst the Chartists, but when the Carbonari symbols were recognised\r\non the insurgent flags, the troops showed such clear signs of wishing\r\nto go over to the enemy that they were quietly taken back to Naples.\r\nThe cry of 'God, the King, and the Constitution,' was taken up through\r\nthe land; General Pepe, who had long been a Carbonaro in secret, was\r\nenthusiastically hailed as commander of the Chartist forces, which\r\npractically comprised the whole army. The King was powerless; besides\r\nwhich, when pushed up into any corner people who do not mind breaking\r\ntheir word have a facility for hard swearing. On the 13th of July,\r\nFerdinand standing at the altar of the royal chapel, with his hand on\r\nthe Bible, swore to defend and maintain the Constitution which he had\r\njust granted. If he failed to do so, he called upon his subjects to\r\ndisobey him, and God to call him to account. These words he read from\r\na written form; as if they were not enough, he added, with his eyes on\r\nthe cross, and his face turned towards heaven: 'Omnipotent God, who\r\nwith Thine infinite power canst read the soul of man and the future,\r\ndo Thou, if I speak falsely, or intend to break my oath, at this\r\nmoment direct the thunder of Thy vengeance on my head.'\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitans had got their liberties, but they soon found\r\nthemselves face to face with perplexities which would have taxed the\r\npowers of men both wiser and more experienced in free government than\r\nthey were. In the first place, although a revolution may be made by a\r\nsect, a government cannot be carried on by one. The Carbonari who had\r\nwon the day were blind to this self-evident truth; and, to make\r\nmatters worse, there was a split in their party, some of them being\r\ndisposed to throw off the Bourbon yoke altogether; a natural desire,\r\nbut as it was only felt by a minority, it added to the general\r\nconfusion. Then came, as it was sure to come, the cry for separation\r\nfrom Sicily. The Sicilians wanted back the violated constitution\r\nobtained for them by the English in 1812, and would have nothing to do\r\nwith that offered them from Naples. In every one of the struggles\r\nbetween Sicily and Naples, it is impossible to refuse sympathy to the\r\nislanders, who, in the pride of their splendid independent history,\r\ndeemed themselves the victims of an inferior race; but it is equally\r\nimpossible to ignore that, politically, they were in the wrong. In\r\nunion, and in union alone, lay the only chance of resisting the\r\ninternational plot to keep the South Italian populations in perpetual\r\nbondage. The Sicilian revolt was put down at first mildly, and\r\nfinally, as mildness had no effect, with the usual violence by the\r\nNeapolitan Constitutional Government, which could not avoid losing\r\ncredit and popularity in the operation. Meanwhile, the three persons\r\nwho traded under the name of Europe met at Troppau, and came readily\r\nto the conclusion that 'the sovereigns of the Holy Alliance exercised\r\nan incontestable right in taking common measures of security against\r\nstates which the overthrow of authority by revolt placed in a hostile\r\nattitude towards every legitimate government.' The assumption was too\r\nbroadly stated, even for Lord Castlereagh's acceptance; but he was\r\ncontented to make a gentle protest, which he further nullified by\r\nallowing that, in the present case, intervention was very likely\r\njustified. France expressed no disapproval. Only the Netherlands,\r\nSwitzerland, Sweden and Spain gave the Constitutional _régime_ tacit\r\nsupport by recognising it. The Emperor of Russia was very anxious to\r\ntake part in the business, and would have sent off an army instantly\r\nhad not his royal brother of Prussia hesitated to consent to the\r\ninconvenience of a Cossack march through his territory. The work was\r\nleft, therefore, to the Emperor of Austria. Before entering upon it,\r\nit occurred to these three to invite the King of Naples to meet them\r\nat Laybach. They knew his character.\r\n\r\nFerdinand assured his Parliament that he was going to Laybach solely\r\nto induce the Holy Alliance to think better of its opposition, and to\r\nagree, at least, to all the principal features of the new state of\r\nthings. Most foolishly the Parliament, which, according to the\r\nConstitution, might have vetoed his leaving the country, let him go.\r\nBefore starting he wrote an open letter to his dear son, the Duke of\r\nCalabria, who was appointed Regent, in which he said: 'I shall defend\r\nthe events of the past July before the Congress. I firmly desire the\r\nSpanish Constitution for my kingdom; and although I rely on the\r\njustice of the assembled sovereigns, and on their old friendship,\r\nstill it is well to tell you that, in whatever circumstance it may\r\nplease God to place me, my course will be what I have manifested on\r\nthis sheet, strong and unchangeable either by force or by the flattery\r\nof others.'\r\n\r\nBrave words! News came in due time of the sequel. On the 9th of\r\nFebruary 1821, the Regent received a letter from the King, in which he\r\ngave the one piece of advice that the people should submit to their\r\nfate quietly. He was coming back with 50,000 Austrians, and a Russian\r\narmy was ready to start if wanted. Nevertheless, to prevent a sudden\r\noutbreak before the foreign troops arrived, the Regent carried on a\r\ngame of duplicity to the last, and pretended to second, whilst he\r\nreally baulked, the preparations for resistance decreed by Parliament.\r\nBaron Poerio, the father of two patriot martyrs of the future,\r\nsustained the national dignity by urging Parliament to yield only to\r\nforce, and to defy the barbarous horde which was bearing down on the\r\ncountry. The closing scene is soon told. On the 7th of March, in the\r\nmountains near Rieti, General Guglielmo Pepe, with 8000 regular troops\r\nand a handful of militia, encountered an overwhelmingly superior force\r\nof Austrians. The Neapolitans stood out well for six hours, but on the\r\nAustrian reserves coming up, they were completely routed, and obliged\r\nto fly in all directions.\r\n\r\n'Order reigned' in the kingdom of Naples. In Sicily, a gallant attempt\r\nat insurrection was begun, but there was not the spirit to go on with\r\nit, and General Rossaroll, its initiator, had to fly to Spain. The\r\nafterpiece is what might have been expected; an insensate desire for\r\nvengeance got hold of Ferdinand, and the last years of his life were\r\nspent in hunting down his enemies, real or imaginary. Morelli and\r\nSilvati were hung, the fugitives, Pepe and Rossaroll, were condemned\r\nto death, but this was only the beginning. The Austrian commander\r\ncounselled mercy, but in this respect the King showed an independent\r\nmind. A court-martial was instituted to examine the conduct of\r\necclesiastics, public functionaries and soldiers, from the year 1793\r\ndownwards. No one was safe who had expressed a dislike of absolutism\r\nwithin the last thirty years. A blameless gentleman who was a\r\nCarbonaro, was conducted through Naples on the back of an ass, and\r\nbeaten with a whip, to which nails were attached. Eight hundred\r\npersons are said to have perished at the hands of the state in one\r\nyear. Ferdinand himself expired on the 3rd of January 1825, after\r\nmisgoverning for sixty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan revolution had just collapsed, when another broke out\r\nin Piedmont, which, though short in duration, was to have far-reaching\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the King of Sardinia was Victor Emmanuel I., who\r\nsucceeded his brother Charles Emmanuel in 1802, when the latter\r\nabdicated and retired to Rome, where he joined the Society of Jesus.\r\nVictor Emmanuel's only son was dead, and the throne would devolve on\r\nhis youngest brother, Charles Felix, Duke of Genoa, whom reasons of\r\nstate led to abandon the wish to become a monk, which he had formed as\r\na boy of eleven, on being taken to visit a convent near Turin. But\r\nCharles Felix, though married, was without children, and the\r\nlegitimate heir-presumptive was Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano,\r\nwho represented the younger branch of the family, which divided from\r\nthe main line in the early part of the seventeenth century. Charles\r\nAlbert's father was the luckless Prince Charles of Carignano, who,\r\nalone of his house, came to terms with Napoleon, who promised him a\r\npension, which was not paid. His mother, a Saxon Princess, paraded the\r\nstreets of Turin, dressed in the last republican fashion, with her\r\ninfant son in her arms. Afterwards, she gave him a miscellaneous\r\neducation, that included a large dose of Rousseau from a Swiss\r\nprofessor. The boy was shifted from place to place, happier when his\r\nmother forgot him, than when, in temporary recollection of his\r\nexistence, she called him to her. Once when he was travelling with the\r\nPrincess and her second husband, M. de Montléart, Charles Albert was\r\nmade to sit on the box of the carriage, in a temperature many degrees\r\nbelow zero.\r\n\r\nHis uncles (as the King and Charles Felix called themselves, though\r\nthey were his cousins) heard with natural horror of the vagaries of\r\nthe Princess of Carignano, and they extended their antipathy from the\r\nmother to the son, even when he was a child. In Victor Emmanuel, this\r\nantipathy was moderated by the easy good-nature of his character; in\r\nCharles Felix, it degenerated into an intense hatred.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular thing that Prince Metternich, from the very first,\r\nhad an instinctive feeling that the unfortunate boy, who seemed the\r\nmost hopeless and helpless of human creatures, would prove the evil\r\ngenius of the Austrian power. He therefore set to work to deprive him\r\nof his eventual rights. He was confident of success, as fortune had\r\narranged matters in a manner that offered a ready-made plan for\r\ncarrying out the design. Victor Emmanuel had four daughters, precluded\r\nfrom reigning by the Salic law, which was in force in Piedmont. His\r\nwife, the Queen Maria Teresa, a woman of great beauty and insatiable\r\nambition, was sister to the Austrian Archduke Francis d'Este, Duke of\r\nModena. Francis had never married, having been robbed of his intended\r\nbride, the Archduchess Marie-Louise, by her betrothal to Napoleon.\r\nWhat simpler than to marry the eldest of the Sardinian princesses to\r\nher uncle, abrogate the Salic law, and calmly await the desired\r\nconsummation of an Austrian prince, by right of his wife, occupying\r\nthe Sardinian throne?\r\n\r\nThe first step was soon taken; princesses came into the world to be\r\nsacrificed. The plot ran on for some time, the Queen, who was in the\r\nhabit of calling Charles Albert 'that little vagrant,' giving it her\r\nindefatigable support. Victor Emmanuel was weak, and stood in\r\nconsiderable awe of his wife, who had obtained a great ascendancy over\r\nhim in the miserable days of their residence in the island of\r\nSardinia. His nephew, who was almost or wholly unknown to him, partook\r\nof the nature of a disagreeable myth. Nevertheless he had a sense of\r\njustice, as well as Savoy blood, in his veins--he resisted; but the\r\nday came when his surrender seemed probable. Just at that moment,\r\nhowever, the Duke of Modena prematurely revealed the project by asking\r\nthrough his representative at the Congress of Vienna for the port of\r\nSpezia, in order that he might conveniently connect his own state with\r\nhis prospective possession, the island of Sardinia. Prince Talleyrand\r\nwas alarmed by the vision of Austria supreme in the Mediterranean, and\r\nthrough his opposition the conspiracy, for the time, was upset, and\r\nthe rights of Charles Albert were recognised.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, Prince Metternich had insisted on the young Prince,\r\nthen seventeen, visiting the headquarters of the Allies. Charles Felix\r\n(who was unconnected with the Modena scheme) wrote a letter to the\r\nKing on this subject, in which he stated it as his belief that the\r\nAustrian plan was to get Charles Albert accidentally killed, or to\r\nplunge him in vice, or to make him contract a discreditable marriage.\r\nThis was why they had invited him to their camp. He adds the\r\ncharacteristic remark that their nephew would be in no less danger at\r\nthe headquarters of the Duke of Wellington 'à cause de la religion.'\r\nHave him home and have him married, is his advice. 'We are well\r\ntreated, because there is the expectation of soon devouring our\r\nremains by extinguishing the House of Savoy. It is the habit of the\r\ncabinet of Vienna; it was thus they made an end of the House of Este.'\r\n\r\nThese counsels were the more likely to impress Victor Emmanuel from\r\nhis knowledge that they were inspired by no shadow of personal\r\ninterest in 'the little vagrant,' but by the race-feeling alone. The\r\nQueen contrived to prevent the immediate recall of the Prince of\r\nCarignano, but she was obliged to give way, and he was definitely\r\nestablished in Piedmont. In 1818 he was married at Florence to the\r\nArchduchess Maria Teresa of Tuscany, who, on the 14th of March 1820,\r\ngave birth to the child that was to become the first King of Italy.\r\n\r\nVery soon after his return to his country, the hopes of the Liberal\r\nparty began to centre in the young Prince, whom some of their more\r\nardent spirits already saluted as the rising sun. Those who made his\r\nacquaintance were fascinated by the charm of manner which he could\r\nalways exert when he chose, and were confirmed in their hopes by his\r\nevident susceptibility to the magnetism of new ideas and fatalistic\r\nambitions. What they did not perceive was, that in his nature lay\r\nthat ingrained tendency to drift before the wind, which is the most\r\ndangerous thing in politics. In the mid-sea of events he might\r\nchange his course without conscious insincerity, but with the\r\nself-abandonment of a mind which, under pressure, loses the sense of\r\npersonal responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn Piedmont, Carbonarism had made great way among the upper classes\r\nand among the younger officers; the flower of the country was enrolled\r\nin its ranks, and the impatience to take some action towards procuring\r\nfree institutions for themselves, and doing something for their\r\nLombard brothers, had reached fever heat in the spring of 1821, when\r\nthe affairs of Naples were creating much excitement. The principal\r\nconspirators, noble young men, full of unselfish ardour, were the\r\nchosen friends and companions of the Prince of Carignano. It was\r\nformerly the opinion that they made him the confidant of their plans\r\nfrom the first, that he was one of them, in short--a Carbonaro bound\r\nby all the oaths and obligations of the society. The judgment of his\r\nconduct afterwards is, of course, much affected by this point; were\r\nthe assumption correct, the invectives launched against him, not by\r\nany means only by republican writers, would hardly seem excessive. But\r\nby the light of documents issued in recent times, it appears more just\r\nas well as more charitable to suppose that Charles Albert's complicity\r\nwas of a much less precise character. A little encouragement from a\r\nprince goes a long way.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own account, he was taken by surprise when, on the\r\nand or 3rd of March, his friends Carail, Collegno, Santa Rosa and\r\nLisio came to tell him in secret that they belonged to societies\r\nwhich had been long working for the independence of Italy, and that\r\nthey reckoned on him, knowing well his affection for his country, to\r\naid them in obtaining from the King some few first concessions, which\r\nwould be the prelude of a glorious future. It is clear that he ought\r\neither to have broken with them altogether from that moment or to have\r\ncast his lot with them for good or evil. He tried a middle course. He\r\ninduced the conspirators to put off the revolution by which they\r\nintended to enforce their demands, and he conveyed to the King\r\ninformation of what had happened, asking at the same time that no\r\nmeasures should be taken against incriminated persons.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no precautions of any kind seem to have been taken. Victor\r\nEmmanuel, frightened at first, was soon reassured. The revolution, which\r\nwas to have begun on the 8th, actually broke out on the 10th of March at\r\nAlessandria, where the counter orders issued at Charles. Albert's\r\nrequest, after the interview just described, were not obeyed. The\r\ngarrison 'pronounced' in favour of the Spanish Constitution. It was now\r\nimpossible to draw back. From Alessandria the revolution spread to the\r\ncapital. The bulk of the army sympathised with the movement, and relied\r\non the support of the people. The greatest ladies mixed with the crowds\r\nwhich gathered under the Carbonaro flag--black, blue and red. On the\r\nother hand, there were a few devoted servants of the House of Savoy who\r\nbeheld these novelties with the sensations of a quiet person who sees\r\nfrom his window the breaking loose of a menagerie. Invincibly ignorant\r\nof all that was really inspiring in this first breath of freedom, they\r\nsaw nothing in it but an unwarrantable attack on the authority of their\r\namiable, if weak, old King, for whom they would gladly have shed every\r\ndrop of their blood--not from the rational esteem which the people of\r\nItaly, like the people of England, now feel for their sovereign, but\r\nfrom the pure passion of loyalty which made the cavalier stand blindly\r\nby his prince, whether he was good or bad, in the right or in the wrong.\r\nMen of their type watched the evolution of Piedmont into Italy from\r\nfirst to last with the same presentiment of evil, the same moral\r\nincapacity of appreciation. A handful of these loyal servitors hurried\r\nto Victor Emmanuel to offer their assistance. They marshalled their\r\ntroop in battle-array in the courtyard of the palace. Their arms were\r\nantiquated pistols and rapiers, and they themselves were veterans, some\r\nof them of eighty years, mounted on steeds as ancient. The King thanked\r\nthem, but declined their services; nor would he give _carte blanche_ to\r\nCaptain Raimondi, who assured him that with his one company he could\r\nsuppress the insurrection if invested with full powers. Soon after this\r\nrefusal, a firing of guns announced that the citadel was in the hands\r\nof the insurgents. The troops within and without fraternised; it was a\r\nfine moment for those who knew history and who were bent in their hearts\r\non driving the foreigner out of Italy. Here at the citadel of Turin,\r\nduring the siege of 1706, occurred the memorable deed of Pietro Micca,\r\nthe peasant-soldier, who, when he heard the enemy thundering at the door\r\nof the gallery, thought life and the welcome of wife and child and the\r\nhappy return to his village of less account than duty, and fired the\r\nmine which sent him and three companies of French Grenadiers to their\r\nfinal reckoning.\r\n\r\nAfter vacillating for two or three days, Victor Emmanuel abdicated on\r\nthe 13th of March. The Queen desired to be appointed regent, but, to\r\nher intense vexation, the appointment was given to Charles Albert. A\r\nmore unenviable honour never fell to the lot of man.\r\n\r\nDeserted by the ministers of the crown, who resigned in a body, alone\r\nin the midst of a triumphant revolution, appealed to in the name of\r\nthose sentiments of patriotism which he could never hear invoked\r\nunmoved, the young Prince uttered the words which were as good as a\r\nsurrender: 'I, too, am an Italian!' That evening he allowed the\r\nSpanish Constitution to be proclaimed subject to the arrival of the\r\norders of the new King.\r\n\r\nThe new King! No one remembered that there existed such a person. Nor\r\nhad anyone recollected that the Spanish Constitution abrogated the\r\nSalic law, and that hence, instead of a new King, they had a new\r\nQueen--the wife of the Duke of Modena! An eminent Turinese\r\njurisconsulist, who was probably the only possessor of a copy of the\r\ncharter in the town which was screaming itself hoarse for it, divulged\r\nthis awkward discovery.--Several hours were spent in anxious\r\ndiscussion, when the brilliant suggestion was made that the article\r\nshould be cancelled. The article was cancelled.\r\n\r\nBut Charles Felix could not be disposed of so easily. The news of the\r\nlate events reached him at Modena of all places in the world, the\r\nrallying-point of the Prince of Carignano's bitterest foes. He was not\r\nlong in sending his orders. He repudiated everything that had been\r\ndone, and commanded Charles Albert, 'if he had a drop of our royal\r\nblood left in his veins,' to leave the capital instantly for Novara,\r\nwhere he was to await his further instructions.\r\n\r\nCharles Albert obeyed. He was accompanied on his journey--or, as it\r\nmay be called, his flight--by such of the troops as remained loyal.\r\nAt Novara he found a sentence of exile, in a fresh order, to quit\r\nPiedmontese territory. Tuscany was indicated as the state where he was\r\nto reside.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians crossed the frontier with the consent of the King.\r\nCharles Felix's opinion of Austria has been already given; another\r\ntime he said: 'Austria is a sort of bird-lime which, if you get it on\r\nyour fingers, you can never rub off.' If anything was needed to\r\nincrease his loathing for the revolution, it was the necessity in\r\nwhich it placed him, as he thought, of calling in this unloved ally.\r\nBut Charles Felix was not the man to hesitate. Not caring a straw for\r\nthe privilege of wearing a crown himself, his belief in the divine\r\nright of kings, and the obligation to defend it, amounted to\r\nmonomania. The Austrian offer was therefore accepted. On her part\r\nAustria declined the obliging proposal of the Czar of a loan of\r\n100,000 men. She felt that she could do the work unaided, nor was she\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April the Constitutionalist troops which marched towards\r\nNovara, sanguine that the loyal regiments there quartered would end by\r\njoining them, were met by an armed resistance, in which the\r\nnewly-arrived Austrians assisted. Their defeat was complete, and it\r\nwas the signal of the downfall of the revolution. The leaders retired\r\nfrom Turin to Alessandria, and thence to Genoa, that had risen last\r\nand was last to submit. Thus most of them escaped by sea, which was\r\nfortunate, as Charles Felix had the will to establish a White Terror,\r\nand was only prevented by the circumstance that nearly all the\r\nproposed victims were outside his kingdom. Capital sentences were sent\r\nafter them by the folio: there was hardly a noble family which had not\r\none of its members condemned to death. When his brother, Victor\r\nEmmanuel, recommended mercy, he told him that he was entirely ready\r\nto give him back the crown, but that, while he reigned, he should\r\nreign after his own ideas. He seems to have had thoughts of hanging\r\nthe Prince of Carignano, and for a long time he seriously meant to\r\ndevise the kingdom to his son, the infant Prince Victor. Thus a new\r\nset of obstacles arose between Charles Albert and the throne.\r\n\r\nOf the personal friends of that ill-starred Prince all escaped. One of\r\nthem, the noble-minded Count Santorre di Santa Rosa, died fighting for\r\nliberty in Greece. In the miseries of exile and poverty he had never\r\nlost faith in his country, but fearlessly maintained that 'the\r\nemancipation of Italy was an event of the nineteenth century.' To\r\nanother, Giacinta di Collegno, it was reserved to receive the dying\r\nbreath of Charles Albert, when as an exiled and crownless king he\r\nfound rest, at last, at Oporto.\r\n\r\nThere were deeper reasons than any which appear on the surface for the\r\nfailure of the revolutionary movements of this period. North and\r\nsouth, though the populations exhibited a childish delight at the\r\noverthrow of the old, despotic form of government, their effervescence\r\nended as rapidly as it began. They did not really understand what was\r\ngoing on. 'By-the-bye, what _is_ this same constitution they are\r\nmaking such a noise about?' asked a lazzarone who had been shouting\r\n'Viva la Costituzione' all the day. Within a few weeks of the\r\nbreakdown at Novara, Count Confalonieri wrote wisely to Gino Capponi\r\nthat revolutions are not made by high intelligences, but by the masses\r\nwhich are moved by enthusiasm, and for a possibility of success, the\r\nword Constitution, the least magical of words, should have been\r\nreplaced by the more comprehensible and stirring call: 'War to the\r\nstranger.' But this, instead of sounding from every housetop, was\r\npurposely stifled at Naples, and kept a mysterious secret in\r\nPiedmont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRISON AND SCAFFOLD\r\n\r\n1821-1831\r\n\r\nPolitical Trials in Venetia and Lombardy--Risings in the South and\r\nCentre--Ciro Menotti.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Austrians fully expected a rising in Lombardy in the middle of\r\nMarch, and that they were not without serious fears as to its\r\nconsequences is proved by the preparations which they quietly made to\r\nabandon Milan, if necessary. The Court travelling-carriages were got\r\nready, and the younger princes were sent away. Carbonarism had been\r\nintroduced into Lombardy the year before by two Romagnols, Count\r\nLaderchi and Pietro Maroncelli. It was their propaganda that put the\r\nAustrian Government on the alert, and was the cause of the Imperial\r\ndecree which denounced the society as a subversive conspiracy, aiming\r\nat the destruction of all constituted authority, and pointed to death\r\nand confiscation of property as the penalty for joining it. There was\r\nthe additional clause, destined to bear terrible fruit, which declared\r\naccomplices, punishable with life-imprisonment, all who knew of the\r\nexistence of lodges (_Vendite_, as they were called) or the names of\r\nassociates, without informing the police. In the autumn of 1820,\r\nMaroncelli and many others, including Silvio Pellico, the young\r\nPiedmontese poet, were arrested as Carbonari, while the arrest of the\r\nso-called accomplices began with Count Giovanni Arrivabene of Mantua,\r\nwho had no connection with the society, but was charged with having\r\nheard from Pellico that he was a member. Pellico and his companions\r\nwere still lying untried in the horrible Venetian prisons, called,\r\nfrom their leaden roofs, the 'Piombi,' when the events of 1821 gave\r\nrise to a wholesale batch of new arrests. As soon as they knew of a\r\nmovement in Piedmont, the Lombard patriots prepared to co-operate in\r\nit; that they were actually able to do nothing, was because it broke\r\nout prematurely, and also, to some extent, because their head, Count\r\nConfalonieri, was incapacitated by severe illness. But though their\r\nactivity profited not at all to the cause, it was fatal to\r\nthemselves. The Austrian Government had, as has been stated, a\r\ncorrect general notion of what was going on, but at the beginning it\r\nalmost entirely lacked proofs which could inculpate individuals. In\r\nthe matter of arrests, however, there was one sovereign rule which all\r\nthe despotic Governments in Italy could and did follow in every\r\nemergency: it was to lay hands on the most intelligent, distinguished\r\nand upright members of the community. This plan never failed; these\r\nwere the patriots, the conspirators of those days. The second thing\r\nwhich the Austrians made a rule of doing, was to extort from the\r\nprisoners some incautious word, some shadow of an assent or admission\r\nwhich would place them on the track of other compromised persons, and\r\nfurnish them with such scraps of evidence as they deemed sufficient,\r\nin order to proceed against those already in their power. In their\r\nsecret examination of prisoners, they had reduced the system of\r\nprovocative interrogation to a science. They made use of every\r\nsubterfuge, and, above all, of fabricated confessions fathered on\r\nfriends of the prisoner, to extract the exclamation, the nod of the\r\nhead, the confused answer, which served their purpose. The prisoners,\r\nmen of good faith, and inexperienced in the arts of deception, were\r\nbut children in their hands, and scarcely one of them was not doomed\r\nto be the involuntary cause of some other person's ruin--generally\r\nthat of a dear and intimate friend.\r\n\r\nThe first to be arrested was Gaetano De-Castillia, who went with the\r\nMarquis Giorgio Pallavicini on a mission to Piedmont while the\r\nrevolution there was at its height. They even had an interview with\r\nthe Prince of Carignano, 'a pale and tall young man, with a charming\r\nexpression' (so Pallavicini describes him), but had obtained from him\r\nno assurance, except the characteristic parting word: 'Let us hope in\r\nthe future.' When De-Castillia was arrested, Pallavicini, then a youth\r\nof twenty, and full of noble sentiments, rushed to the director of the\r\npolice with the avowal: 'It was I who induced De-Castillia to go to\r\nPiedmont; if the journey was a crime, the fault is mine; punish me!'\r\nNo error could have proved more calamitous; till that moment the\r\nAustrians were in ignorance of the Piedmontese mission; De-Castillia\r\nwas arrested on some far more trifling charge. Pallavicini's generous\r\nfolly was rewarded by fourteen years' imprisonment, and its first\r\nconsequence was the arrest of Count Confalonieri, at whose instance\r\nthe visit to Turin had been made. For months the Austrians had desired\r\nto have a clue against him; the opportunity was come at last.\r\n\r\nFederico Confalonieri, brilliant, handsome, persuasive, of great\r\nwealth and ancient lineage, innately aristocratic, but in the best\r\nsense, was morally at the head of Lombardy, by the selection of the\r\nfittest, which at certain junctures makes one man pre-appointed leader\r\nwhile he is still untried. When in England, the Duke of Sussex\r\nprevailed upon him to become a Freemason, but he was not a Carbonaro\r\nin the technical sense, though both friends and foes believed him to\r\nbe one. He knew, however, more about this and the other secret\r\nsocieties then existing in Italy--even those of the reactionary\r\nparty--than did most of the initiated. In an amusing passage in his\r\nmemoirs he relates how, when once forcibly detained in a miserable\r\nhostelry in the Calabrian Mountains, a den of brigands, of whom the\r\nchief was the landlord, he guessed that this man was a Calderaio, and\r\nit occurred to him to make the sign of that bloodthirsty sect. Things\r\nchanged in a second; the brigand innkeeper was at his feet, the\r\ncomplete household was set in motion to serve him. In 1821, he\r\nfounded at Milan, not a secret society, but an association in which\r\nall the best patriots were enrolled, and of which the sole engagement\r\nwas the formula, repeated on entering its ranks: 'I swear to God, and\r\non my honour, to exert myself to the utmost of my power, and even at\r\nthe sacrifice of my life, to redeem Italy from foreign dominion.'\r\n\r\nKnowing to what extent he was a marked man, Confalonieri would have\r\nonly exercised common prudence in leaving the country, but he could\r\nnot reconcile himself to the idea of flight. Anonymous warnings rained\r\nupon him: most likely they all came from the same quarter, from Count\r\nBubna, the Austrian Field-Marshal, with whom Confalonieri was\r\npersonally on friendly terms. On the 12th of December the Countess\r\nBubna made a last effort to save him; her carriage was ready, she\r\nimplored him to take it and escape across the frontier. He refused,\r\nand next day he was arrested.\r\n\r\nAustrian legal procedure was slow; the trial of the first Carbonari,\r\nSilvio Pellico and his companions, did not take place till 1822. On\r\nthe 22nd of February the sentence of death was read to Silvio Pellico\r\nin his Venetian prison, to be commuted to one of fifteen years'\r\nimprisonment at Spielberg, a fortress converted into a convict prison\r\nin a bleak position in Moravia. To that rock of sorrow, consecrated\r\nfor ever by the sufferings of some of the purest of men, Silvio\r\nPellico and Pietro Maroncelli, with nine or ten companions, condemned\r\nat the same time, were the first Italians to take the road. Here they\r\nremained for the eight years described by the author of _Francesca da\r\nRimini_, in _Le Mie Prigioni_, a book that served the Italian cause\r\nthroughout the world. Even now some Italians are indignant at the\r\nspirit of saintly resignation which breathes upon Silvio Pellico's\r\npages, at the veil which is drawn over many shocking features in the\r\ntreatment of the prisoners; they do not know the tremendous force\r\nwhich such reticence gave his narrative. _Le Mie Prigioni_ has the\r\nreserve strength of a Greek tragedy.\r\n\r\nMaroncelli contracted a disease of the leg through the hardships\r\nendured; amputation became necessary, but could not be performed till\r\npermission was received from Vienna--a detail showing the red-tapism\r\nwhich governed all branches of the Austrian administration. This\r\npatriot went, after his release, to America, where he died, poor,\r\nblind and mad. Pellico, crushed in soul, devoted his latter years\r\nentirely to religion. Only men of iron fibre could come out as they\r\nwent in. The Spielberg prisoners wore chains, and their food was so\r\nbad and scanty that they suffered from continual hunger, with its\r\nattendant diseases. Unlike the thieves and assassins confined in the\r\nsame fortress, the State prisoners were given no news of their\r\nfamilies. Such was Spielberg, 'a sepulchre without the peace of the\r\ndead.'\r\n\r\nThe State trials of the Lombard patriots in 1823 resulted in seven\r\ncapital sentences on the Milanese, thirteen on the Brescians, and four\r\non the Mantuans. The fate of the other prisoners depended on that of\r\nCount Confalonieri. If the sentence on him were not carried out, the\r\nlives at least of the others might be regarded as safe, since he was\r\nlooked upon as the head. It is certain that the authorities, and the\r\nEmperor himself, had the most firm intention of having him executed;\r\nthe more merciful decision was solely due to the Countess\r\nConfalonieri's journey to Vienna. Accompanied by the prisoner's aged\r\nfather, this beautiful and heroic woman, a daughter of the noble\r\nMilanese house of Casati, went to Vienna before the conclusion of the\r\ntrial, to be ready for any eventuality. When the sentence of death was\r\npassed, it was announced by the Emperor to old Count Confalonieri,\r\nwhom he advised to return with the Countess Teresa as fast as possible\r\nif they wished to see the condemned man alive. Undaunted by the news,\r\nthe brave wife sought an interview with the Empress, in whom she found\r\na warm advocate, but who was obliged to own, after several attempts to\r\nobtain a reprieve, that she despaired of success. Teresa Confalonieri\r\nhurried back to Milan through the bitter winter weather, in doubt\r\nwhether she should arrive before the execution had taken place. But\r\nthe unceasing efforts of the Empress won the day. The respite was\r\ngranted on the 13th of January; life-imprisonment was substituted for\r\ndeath. The countess sent her husband the pillow which she had bathed\r\nwith her tears during her terrible journey; needless to say that it\r\nwas not given to him. She died broken-hearted with waiting before he\r\nwas set at liberty in the year 1836.\r\n\r\nWhen Count Confalonieri reached Vienna on his way to Spielberg, he was\r\nsurprised to find himself installed in a luxurious apartment, with\r\nthree servants to wait upon him. Though too ill to touch solid food, a\r\nsumptuous breakfast and dinner were daily set before him; and but for\r\nthe constant jingle of his chains, he would have thought himself in a\r\nfirst-class hotel on a journey of pleasure. The object of these\r\nattentions was clear when one evening Prince Metternich came to see\r\nhim, and stayed for three hours, endeavouring by every exquisite\r\nflattery, by every promise and persuasion, to worm out of him the\r\nsecrets of which he alone was believed to be the depositary. The\r\nAustrian Government had spent £60,000 on the Milan Commission, and,\r\npractically, they were no wiser than when it began. Would Confalonieri\r\nenlighten them? Whatever scruples he might have felt during the trial\r\ncould be now laid aside; there was no question of new arrests. It was\r\nfrom pure, abstract love of knowledge that the Government, or, rather,\r\nthe Emperor, desired to get at the truth. If he preferred to open his\r\nmind to the Emperor in person, His Majesty would grant him a secret\r\naudience. Above all, what was the real truth about the Prince of\r\nCarignano?\r\n\r\nAll the rest was a blind; it was the wish to have some damnatory\r\nevidence against Charles Albert, such as would for ever exclude him\r\nfrom the throne, that had induced the Emperor and his astute minister\r\nto make this final attempt.\r\n\r\n'Confalonieri need never go to Spielberg,' said the Prince; 'let him\r\nthink of his family, of his adored wife, of his own talents, of his\r\nfuture career, which was on the brink of being blotted out as\r\ncompletely as if he were dead!' Confalonieri was worthy of his race,\r\nof his class, of himself; he stood firm, and next morning, almost with\r\na sense of relief, he started for the living grave.\r\n\r\n'The struggle was decided,' Prince Metternich had said in the course\r\nof the interview, 'and decided not only for our own, but for many\r\ngenerations. Those who still hoped to the contrary were madmen.'\r\n\r\nSome years of outward quiet doubtless confirmed him in the first\r\nopinion, while the second was not likely to be shaken by the next\r\nattempt that was made to take up arms for freedom. On the 28th of June\r\n1828, several villages in the province of Salerno rose in obedience to\r\nthe harangues of two patriotic ecclesiastics, Canon de Luca and Carlo\r\nda Celle, superior of a capuchin convent. This was meant to develop\r\ninto a general insurrection, but it was nowhere followed up, and the\r\nsword of vengeance fell speedily on the wretched villagers. Surrounded\r\nby the royal troops, they were forced into submission, many were shot\r\non the spot, others were dragged in chains to Salerno, not even a drop\r\nof water being allowed them during the journey under the scorching\r\nsun. The village of Bosco was rased to the ground. The priest, the\r\nmonk, and twenty-two insurgents were shot after the repression. The\r\nheads of the victims were cut off and placed in iron cages where their\r\nwives or mothers were likely to see them. A woman went to Naples to\r\nbeg for the pardon of her two grandsons, by name Diego and Emilio. The\r\nKing, with barbarous clemency, told her to choose one. In vain she\r\nentreated that if both could not be saved the choice should be left to\r\nchance, or decided by someone else. But no; unless she chose they\r\nwould both be shot. At last she chose Diego. Afterwards she went mad,\r\nand was constantly heard wailing: 'I have killed my grandson Emilio.'\r\nThis anecdote gives a fair notion of Francis I., whose short reign\r\nwas, however, less signalised by acts of cruelty, though there were\r\nenough of these, than by a venality never surpassed. The\r\ngrooms-in-waiting and ladies-of-the-bedchamber sold the public offices\r\nin the daylight; and the King, who was aware of it, thought it a\r\nsubject for vulgar jokes with his intimates. Francis died in 1830 of\r\nbad humour at the Paris revolution, and was succeeded by Ferdinand\r\nII., to be known hereafter as Bomba--then a clownish youth, one of\r\nwhose first kingly cares was to create St Ignatius Loyola a\r\nField-Marshal.\r\n\r\nThe revolution which upset the throne of Charles X., and ushered in\r\nthe eighteen years' reign of the Citizen King, seemed likely to have\r\nmomentous consequences for Italy. The principle of non-intervention\r\nproclaimed by French politicians would, if logically enforced, sound\r\nthe death-knell of the Austrian power in Italy. Dupin, the Minister of\r\nWar, enlarged on the theme in a speech which appeared to remove all\r\ndoubt as to the real intentions of the Government. 'One phrase,' he\r\nremarked, 'has made a general impression; it expresses the true\r\nposition of a loyal and generous Government. Not only has the\r\nPresident of the Council laid down the principle that France should\r\nabstain from intervention; he has declared that she would not tolerate\r\nintervention on the part of others. France might have shut herself up\r\nin a cold egotism, and simply said that she would not intervene; this\r\nwould have been contemptible, but the proclamation of not suffering\r\nthe interventions of others is the noblest attitude a strong and\r\nmagnanimous people can assume; it amounts to saying: Not only will I\r\nnot attack or disturb other nations, but I, France, whose voice is\r\nrespected by Europe and by the whole world, will never permit others\r\nto do so. This is the language held by the ministry and by the\r\nambassadors of Louis Philippe; and it is this which the army, the\r\nNational Guard, France entire, is ready to maintain.'\r\n\r\nTruly language was invented to travesty the truth, and when French\r\npoliticians say they are going to the right it is an almost sure sign\r\nthat they are going to the left; nevertheless, is it possible to blame\r\nthe Italians who read in these assurances a positive promise affecting\r\ntheir own case?\r\n\r\nThe same assurances were repeated again and again through the winter\r\nof 1830-31; they were repeated authoritatively as late as March in the\r\nlatter year. Well may a French writer inquire: 'Was it insanity or\r\ntreachery?'\r\n\r\nThe good tidings were published by the Italian exiles, who, living\r\nclose to the great centres of European politics, were the first to\r\nintoxicate themselves with the great delusion. From London, Gabriele\r\nRossetti sent the exultant summons:\r\n\r\n  Cingi l'elmo, la mitra deponi,\r\n    O vetusta Signora del mondo:\r\n    Sorgi, sorgi dal sonno profondo,\r\n    Io son l'alba del nuovo tuo dì.\r\n\r\n  Saran rotte le vostre catene,\r\n    O Fratelli che in ceppi languite;\r\n    O Fratelli che il giogo soffrite\r\n    Calcherete quel giogo col piè.\r\n\r\nThe child beside whose cradle the ode was written, was to grow to\r\nmanhood while Italy still remained 'the weeping, desolate mother.' The\r\ncry of the poet was not, however, without an echo. In 1831, Romagna,\r\nParma and Modena rose in rebellion.\r\n\r\nThings had been going, without much variation, from bad to worse in\r\nthe Roman states, ever since 1815. Pius VII. (Chiaramonti), who died\r\nin 1823, was succeeded by Leo XII. (Genga), an old man who was in such\r\nenfeebled health that his death was expected at the time of his\r\nelection, but, like a more famous pontiff, he made a sudden recovery,\r\nwhich was attributed to the act of a prelate, who, in prayer, offered\r\nhis own life for the Pope's, and who died a few days after resolving\r\non the sacrifice. During this Pope's reign, the smallpox was rife in\r\nRome, in consequence of the suppression of public vaccination. The\r\nnext conclave, held in 1829, resulted in the election of Pius VIII.\r\n(Castiglioni da Cingoli), who died on the 30th of November 1830, and\r\nwas followed by Gregory XVI. (Cappellari). In each conclave, Austria\r\nhad secured the choice of a 'Zealot,' as the party afterwards called\r\nUltramontane was then designated. The last traces of reforms\r\nintroduced by the French disappeared; criminal justice was again\r\nadministered in secret; the police were arbitrary and irresponsible.\r\nAll over the Roman states, but especially in Romagna, the secret\r\nsociety of the Sanfedesti flourished exceedingly; whether, as is\r\nprobable, an offshoot of the Calderai or of indigenous growth, its\r\naims were the same. The affiliated swore to spill the last drop of the\r\nblood of the Liberals, without regard to sex or rank, and to spare\r\nneither children nor old men. Many Romagnols had left their country\r\nafter the abortive agitation of 1821, and amongst these were the\r\nGambas. Count Pietro died in Greece, where he had gone on the service\r\nof freedom. Had he lived, this young man would have been sure to win a\r\nfair name in the annals of Italian patriotism; he should not, as it\r\nis, be quite forgotten, as it was chiefly due to him that Byron's life\r\ntook the redeeming direction which led to Missolonghi.\r\n\r\nIn February 1831, Romagna and the Marches of Ancona threw off the\r\nPapal Government with an ease which must have surprised the most\r\nsanguine. The white, red and green tricolor was hoisted at Bologna,\r\nwhere, as far as is known, this combination of colours first became a\r\npolitical badge. Thirty-six years before Luigi Zamboni and Gian\r\nBattista De Rolandis of Bologna had distributed rosettes of white, red\r\nand green ribbon; Zamboni was arrested, and strangled himself, afraid\r\nof betraying his friends; De Rolandis was hung on the 23rd of April\r\n1796. Such was the origin of the flag, but, until 1831, the Carbonaro\r\nred, blue and black was the common standard of the revolution. From\r\nthat year forth, the destinies of Italy were accomplished under the\r\ncolours of better augury, so fit to recall her fiery volcanoes, her\r\nwooded Apennines, her snow-crowned Alps; colours which in one sense\r\nshe receives from Dante, who clothes in them the vision of the\r\nglorified Beatrice.\r\n\r\nThe rising at Parma requires but little comment. The Empress\r\nMarie-Louise neither hated her subjects, nor was hated by them, but\r\nher engagements with Austria prevented her from granting the demanded\r\nconcessions, and she abandoned her state, to return to it, indeed,\r\nunder Austrian protection, but without the odious corollary of\r\nvindictive measures which was generally meant by a restoration.\r\n\r\nMuch more important is the history of the Modenese revolution.\r\nApologists have been found for the Bourbons of Naples, but, if anyone\r\never said a good word for Francesco d'Este, it has escaped the notice\r\nof the present writer. Under a despotism without laws (for the edicts\r\nof the Prince daily overrode the Este statute book which was supposed\r\nto be in force), Modena was far more in the power of the priests, or\r\nrather of the Jesuits, than any portion of the states of the Church.\r\nSquint-eyed, crooked in mind and bloodthirsty, Francis was as ideal a\r\nbogey-tyrant as can be discovered outside fiction. In 1822, he hung\r\nthe priest Giuseppe Andreoli on the charge of Carbonarism; and his\r\ntheory of justice is amusingly illustrated by the story of his sending\r\nin a bill to Sir Anthony Panizzi--who had escaped to England--for the\r\nexpenses of hanging him in effigy.\r\n\r\nFrancis felt deeply annoyed by the narrow limits of his dominions, and\r\nhis annoyance did not decrease with the decreasing chances of his\r\nousting the Prince of Carignano from the Sardinian throne. He was\r\nintensely ambitious, and one of his subjects, a man, in other\r\nrespects, of high intelligence, thought that his ambition could be\r\nturned to account for Italy. It was the mistake over again that\r\nMachiavelli had made with Cesare Borgia.\r\n\r\nCiro Menotti, who conceived the plan of uniting Italy under the Duke\r\nof Modena, was a Modenese landed proprietor who had exerted himself to\r\npromote the industry of straw-plaiting, and the other branches of\r\ncommerce likely to be of advantage to an agricultural population. He\r\nwas known as a sound philanthropist, an excellent husband and father,\r\na model member of society. Francis professed to take an interest in\r\nindustrial matters; Menotti, therefore, easily gained access to his\r\nperson. In all the negotiations that followed, the Modenese patriot\r\nwas supported and encouraged by a certain Dr Misley, who was of\r\nEnglish extraction, with whom the Duke seems to have been on familiar\r\nterms. It appears not doubtful that Menotti was led to believe that\r\nhis political views were regarded with favour, and that he also\r\nreceived the royal promise that, whatever happened, his life would be\r\nsafe. This promise was given because he had the opportunity of saving\r\nthe Duke from some great peril--probably from assassination, though\r\nthe particulars were never divulged.\r\n\r\nMisley went to Paris to concert with the Italian committee which had\r\nits seat there; the movement in Modena was fixed for the first days of\r\nFebruary. But spies got information of the preparations, and on the\r\nevening of the 3rd, before anything had been done, Menotti's house was\r\nsurrounded by troops, and after defending it, with the help of his\r\nfriends, for two hours, he was wounded and captured. Next day the Duke\r\ndespatched the following note to the Governor of Reggio-Emilia: 'A\r\nterrible conspiracy against me has broken out. The conspirators are in\r\nmy hands. Send me the hangman.--Francis.'\r\n\r\nNot all, however, of the conspirators were in his hands; the movement\r\nmatured, in spite of the seizure of Menotti, and Francis, 'the first\r\ncaptain in the world,' as he made his troops call him, was so overcome\r\nwith fright that on the 5th of February he left Modena with his\r\nfamily, under a strong military escort, dragging after him Giro\r\nMenotti, who, when Mantua was reached, was consigned to an Austrian\r\nfortress.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the revolution triumphed. Modena chose one of her citizens\r\nas dictator, Biagio Nardi, who issued a proclamation in which the\r\nwords 'Italy is one; the Italian nation is one sole nation,' testified\r\nthat the great lesson which Menotti had sought to teach had not fallen\r\non unfruitful ground. Wild as were the methods by which, for a moment,\r\nhe sought to gain his end, his insistance on unity nevertheless gives\r\nMenotti the right to be considered the true precursor of Mazzini in\r\nthe Italian Revolution.\r\n\r\nNow that the testing-time was come, France threw to the winds the\r\nprinciple announced in her name with such solemn emphasis. 'Precious\r\nFrench blood should never be shed except on behalf of French\r\ninterests,' said Casimir Périer, the new President of the Council. A\r\nmonth after the flight of the Duke of Modena, the inevitable Austrians\r\nmarched into his state to win it back for him. The hastily-organised\r\nlittle army of the new government was commanded by General Zucchi, an\r\nold general of Napoleon, who, when Lombardy passed to Austria, had\r\nentered the Austrian service. He now offered his sword to the Dictator\r\nof Modena, who accepted it, but there was little to be done save to\r\nretire with honour before the 6000 Austrians. Zucchi capitulated at\r\nAncona to Cardinal Benvenuti, the Papal delegate. Those of the\r\nvolunteers who desired it were furnished with regular passports, and\r\nauthorised to take ship for any foreign port. The most compromised\r\navailed themselves of this arrangement, but the vessel which was to\r\nbear Zucchi and 103 others to Marseilles, was captured by the Austrian\r\nAdmiral Bandiera, by whom its passengers were kidnapped and thrown\r\ninto Venetian prisons, where they were kept till the end of May 1832.\r\nThis act of piracy was chiefly performed with a view to getting\r\npossession of General Zucchi, who was tried as a deserter, and\r\ncondemned to twenty years' imprisonment. Among the prisoners was the\r\nyoung wife of Captain Silvestro Castiglioni of Modena. 'Go, do your\r\nduty as a citizen,' she had said, when her husband left her to join\r\nthe insurrection. 'Do not betray it for me, as perhaps it would make\r\nme love you less.' She shared his imprisonment, but just at the moment\r\nof the release, she died from the hardships endured.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the month of March, the Austrians had restored Romagna\r\nto the Pope, and Modena to Francis IV. In Romagna the amnesty\r\npublished by Cardinal Benvenuti was revoked, but there were no\r\nexecutions; this was not the case in Modena. The Duke brought back\r\nCiro Menotti attached to his triumphal car, and when he felt that all\r\ndanger was past, and that the presence of the Austrians was a\r\nguarantee against a popular expression of anger, he had him hung.\r\n\r\n'When my children are grown up, let them know how well I loved my\r\ncountry,' Menotti wrote to his wife on the morning of his execution.\r\nThe letter was intercepted, and only delivered to his family in 1848.\r\nThe revolutionists found it in the archives of Modena. On the\r\nscaffold he recalled how he was once the means of saving the Duke's\r\nlife, and added that he pardoned his murderer, and prayed that his\r\nblood might not fall upon his head.\r\n\r\nDuring the insurrection in Romagna, an event occurred which was not\r\nwithout importance to Europe, though it passed almost unnoticed at the\r\ntime. The eldest son of Queen Hortense died in her arms at Forlì, of a\r\nneglected attack of measles; some said of poison, but the report was\r\nunfounded. He and his brother Louis, who had been closely mixed up\r\nwith Italian conspiracies for more than a year, went to Romagna to\r\noffer their services as volunteers in the national army. By the death\r\nof the elder of the two, Louis Napoleon became heir to what seemed\r\nthen the shadowy sovereignty of the Buonapartes.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Austrians retired from the Legations in July 1831,\r\nthan the revolution broke out again. Many things had been promised,\r\nnothing performed; disaffection was universal, anarchy became chronic,\r\nand was increased by the indiscipline of the Papal troops that were\r\nsent to put it down. The Austrians returned and the French occupied\r\nAncona, much to the Pope's displeasure, and not one whit to the\r\nadvantage of the Liberals. This dual foreign occupation of the Papal\r\nstates lasted till the winter of 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n'YOUNG ITALY' 1831-1844\r\n\r\nAccession of Charles Albert--Mazzini's Unitarian Propaganda--The\r\nBrothers Bandiera.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 27 April 1831, Charles Albert came to the throne he had so nearly\r\nlost. His reconciliation with his uncle, Charles Felix, had been\r\neffected after long and melancholy preliminaries. To wash off the\r\nLiberal sins of his youth, or possibly with a vague hope of finding an\r\nescape from his false position in a soldier's death, he joined the Duc\r\nd'Angoulême's expedition against the Spanish Constitutionalists. His\r\nextraordinary daring in the assault of the Trocadero caused him to be\r\nthe hero of the hour when he returned with the army to Paris; but the\r\nKing of Sardinia still refused to receive him with favour--a\r\nsufficiently icy favour when it was granted--until he signed an\r\nengagement, which remained secret, to preserve intact during his reign\r\nthe laws and principles of government which he found in force at his\r\naccession. If there had been an Order of the Millstone, Charles Felix\r\nwould doubtless have conferred it upon his dutiful nephew; failing\r\nthat, he presented to him for signature this wonderful document, the\r\ninvention of which he owed to Prince Metternich. At the Congress of\r\nVerona in 1822, Charles Albert's claims to the succession were\r\nrecognised, thanks chiefly to the Duke of Wellington, who represented\r\nEngland in place of Lord Londonderry (Castlereagh), that statesman\r\nhaving committed suicide just as he was starting for Verona. Prince\r\nMetternich then proposed that the Prince of Carignano should be called\r\nupon to enter into an agreement identical with the compact he was\r\nbrought to sign a couple of years later. In communicating the proposal\r\nto Canning, the Duke of Wellington wrote that he had demonstrated to\r\nPrince Metternich 'the fatality of such an arrangement,' but that he\r\ndid not think that he had made the slightest impression on him. So the\r\nevent proved; baffled for the moment, the Prince managed to put his\r\nplan in execution through a surer channel.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of Charles Albert appears upon the political scene\r\na great actor in the Liberation of Italy, Giuseppe Mazzini. Young and\r\nunknown, except for a vague reputation for restlessness and for talent\r\nwhich caused the government of Charles Felix to imprison him for six\r\nor seven months at Savona, Mazzini proposed to the new King the terms\r\non which he might keep his throne, as calmly as Metternich had\r\nproposed to him the terms on which he might ascend it. The contrast is\r\nstriking; on the one side the statesman, who still commanded the armed\r\nforce of three-fourths of Europe, doing battle for the holy alliance\r\nof autocrats, for the international law of repression, for all the\r\ntraditions of the old diplomacy; on the other, the young student with\r\nlittle money and few friends, already an exile, having no allies but\r\nhis brain and his pen, who set himself, certain of success, to\r\ndissolve that mighty array of power and pomp. All his life Charles\r\nAlbert was a Faust for the possession of whose soul two irreconcilable\r\nforces contended; the struggle was never more dramatically represented\r\nthan at this moment in the person of these two champions.\r\n\r\nMazzini's letter to Charles Albert, which was read by the King, and\r\nwidely, though secretly, circulated in Piedmont, began by telling him\r\nthat his fellow-countrymen were ready to believe his line of conduct\r\nin 1821 to have been forced on him by circumstances, and that there\r\nwas not a heart in Italy that did not quicken at his accession, nor an\r\neye in Europe that was not turned to watch his first steps in the\r\ncareer that now unfolded before him. Then he went on to show, with the\r\nlogical strength in developing an argument which, joined to a novel\r\nand eloquent style, caused his writings to attract notice from the\r\nfirst, that the King could take no middle course. He would be one of\r\nthe first of men, or the last of Italian tyrants; let him choose. Had\r\nhe never looked upon Italy, radiant with the smile of nature, crowned\r\nwith twenty centuries of sublime memories, the mother of genius,\r\npossessing infinite means, to which only union was lacking, girt round\r\nwith such defences that a strong will and a few courageous breasts\r\nwould suffice to defend her? Had it never struck him that she was\r\ncreated for a glorious destiny? Did he not contemplate her people,\r\nsplendid still, in spite of the shadow of servitude, the vigour of\r\nwhose intellect, the energy of whose passions, even when turned to\r\nevil, showed that the making of a nation was there? Did not the\r\nthought come to him: 'Draw a world out of these dispersed elements\r\nlike a god from chaos; unite into one whole the scattered members, and\r\npronounce the words, \"It is mine, and it is happy\"?'\r\n\r\nMazzini in 1831 was twenty-six years of age. His father was a Genoese\r\nphysician, his mother a native of Chiavari. She was a superior woman,\r\nand devoted more than a mother's care to the excitable and delicate\r\nchild, who seemed to her (mothers have sometimes the gift of prophecy)\r\nto be meant for an uncommon lot. One of the few personal reminiscences\r\nthat Mazzini left recorded, relates to the time and manner in which\r\nthe idea first came to him of the possibility of Italians doing\r\nsomething for their country. He was walking with his mother in the\r\nStrada Nuova at Genoa one Sunday in April 1821, when a tall,\r\nblack-bearded man with a fiery glance held towards them a white\r\nhandkerchief, saying: 'For the refugees of Italy.' Mazzini's mother,\r\ngave him some money, and he passed on. In the streets were many\r\nunfamiliar faces; the fugitives from Turin and Alessandria were\r\ngathered at Genoa before they departed by sea into exile. The\r\nimpression which that scene made on the mind of the boy of sixteen was\r\nnever effaced.\r\n\r\nOwing to his delicate health, Mazzini's early education was carried on\r\nat home, where the social atmosphere was that of one of those little\r\ncentres in a provincial capital which are composed of a few people,\r\nmostly kindred, of similar tastes, who lead useful and refined lives,\r\ncontent with moderate ease. The real exclusiveness of such centres\r\nexceeds any that exists in the most aristocratic sphere in the world.\r\nThe Mazzinis were, moreover, Genoese to the core; and this was another\r\nreason for exclusiveness, and for holding aloof from the governing\r\nclass. Mazzini was born a few days after Napoleon entered Genoa as its\r\nlord. He had not, therefore, breathed the air of the ancient Republic;\r\nbut there was the unadulterated republicanism of a thousand years in\r\nhis veins.\r\n\r\nWhen he grew to manhood his appearance was striking. The black,\r\nflowing hair, the pale, olive complexion, the finely-cut features and\r\nlofty brow, the deep-set eyes, which could smile as only Italian eyes\r\ncan smile, but which could also flash astral infinitudes of scorn, the\r\nfragile figure, even the long, delicate, tapering fingers, marked him\r\nfor a man apart--though whether a poet or an apostle, a seer or a\r\nsaint, it was not easy to decide. Yet this could be said at once: if\r\nthis man concentrated all his being on a single point, he would wield\r\nthe power, call it what we will, which in every age has worked\r\nmiracles and moved mountains.\r\n\r\nMazzini became a Carbonaro, though the want of clear, guiding\r\nprinciples in Carbonarism made him misdoubt its efficacy, and its\r\nhierarchical mysteries and initiatory ordeals repelled him by their\r\nchildishness. Then followed his arrest, and his detention in the\r\nfortress of Savona, which was the turning-point in his mental life.\r\nBefore that date he learnt, after it he taught. From his high-perched\r\ncell he saw the sea and the sky--with the Alps, the sublimest things\r\nin Nature. The voices of the fishermen reached his ears, though he\r\ncould not see them. A tame goldfinch was his companion. Here, in a\r\nsolitude and peace which he remembered with regret in the stormy and\r\nsorrowful years that were to come, he conceived his message and the\r\nmission, in which he believed to the last day of his life.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to found a new association on broader and simpler lines than\r\nthe secret societies of the past, which should aim not only at the\r\nmaterial freeing of Italy from her present bondage, but at her moral and\r\nreligious regeneration. To aim at material progress of any kind, without\r\nat the same time aiming at a higher moral progress, seemed to Mazzini\r\nabsurd; to attempt to pull down without attempting to build up seemed to\r\nhim criminal. Thus he accused the Socialists of substituting the\r\nprogress of humanity's kitchen for the progress of humanity. He believed\r\nthat Italy, united and redeemed, was destined to shed through the world\r\nthe light of a new moral unity, which should end the reign of\r\nScepticism, triumphant among discordant creeds. Mazzini's religious\r\nbelief was the motor of his whole being. The Catholicism in which he was\r\noutwardly brought up never seems to have touched his inner nature; he\r\nwent through no spiritual wrench in leaving a faith that was never a\r\nreality to him. The same is true of innumerable young Italians, who,\r\nwhen they begin to read and study, drift out of their childhood's\r\nreligion without a struggle or a regret. But thought and study brought\r\nMazzini what it rarely brings to these young men--the necessity to find\r\nsomething in which he could believe. He had not long to seek for a basis\r\nto his creed, because he was one of the men from the prophets of old to\r\nSpinoza, from Spinoza to Gordon, to whom the existence of God is a\r\nmatter of experience rather than an object of faith. Starting from this\r\npoint, he formed his religion out of what he regarded as its inevitable\r\ndeductions. If God existed, his creatures must be intended for\r\nperfection; if this were the Divine scheme, man's one business was to\r\ncarry it out. He considered the idea of duty separated from the idea of\r\nGod to be illogical. Either the development of human things depended on\r\na providential law, or it was left to chance and passing circumstance,\r\nand to the dexterity of the man who turned these to most account. God\r\nwas the sole source of duty; duty the sole law of life. Mazzini did not\r\ndenounce Catholicism or any other religion as false. He saw in it a\r\nstepping-stone to purer comprehension, which would be reached when man's\r\nintellect was sufficiently developed for him to be able to do without\r\nsymbols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIUSEPPE MAZZINI]\r\n\r\nThe conscience of humanity is the last tribunal. Ideas, as well as\r\ninstitutions, change and expand, but certain fundamental principles\r\nare fixed. The family would always exist; property would always exist.\r\nThe first, 'the heart's fatherland,' was the source of the only true\r\nhappiness, the only joys untainted by grief, which were given to man.\r\nThose who wished to abolish the second were like the savage who cut\r\ndown the tree in order to gather the fruit. In the future, free\r\nassociation would be the great agent of moral and material progress.\r\nThe authority which once rested in popes and emperors now devolved on\r\nthe people. Instead of 'God and the King,' Mazzini proposed the new\r\nformula 'God and the People.' By the people he understood no caste or\r\nclass, whether high or low, but the universality of men composing the\r\nnation. The nation is the sole sovereign; its will, expressed by\r\ndelegates, must be law to all its citizens.\r\n\r\nBy degrees certain words acquired more and more a mystical\r\nsignificance in Mazzini's mind; the very name of Rome, for instance,\r\nhad for him a sort of talismanic fascination, not unlike that\r\npossessed by Jerusalem for the mediæval Christian. When he spoke of\r\nthe people or the republic he frequently used those terms in an ideal\r\nand visionary sense (as theologians use the Church) rather than in one\r\nstrictly corresponding with the case of any existing nation, or any\r\nhitherto tried form of government. This does not alter the fact that\r\nhis theories, which have been briefly summarised, are not hard to\r\ncomprehend, as has been said by those who did not know in what they\r\nconsisted, nor, taken one by one, are they novel. What was new in the\r\nnineteenth century was the appearance of a revolutionary leader, who\r\nwas before all things a religious and ethical teacher. And though\r\nMazzini never founded the Church of Precursors, of which he dreamt,\r\nhis influence was as surely due to his belief in his religious\r\nmission, as was the influence of Savonarola. The Italians are not a\r\nmystical people, but they have always followed mystical leaders. The\r\nless men are prone to ideal enthusiasm the more attracted are they by\r\nit; Don Quixote, as Heine remarked, always draws Sancho Panza after\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMazzini had a natural capacity for organisation, and the Association\r\nof Young Italy which he founded at Marseilles, the first nucleus being\r\na group of young, penniless refugees, soon obtained an astonishing\r\ndevelopment. Up to the time of his 'Letter to Charles Albert,' his\r\nexile had been so far voluntary that he might have remained in\r\nPiedmont had he agreed to live in one of the smaller towns under the\r\nwatchful care of the police, but he declined the terms, and the first\r\neffect of the 'Letter' was a stringent order to arrest him if he\r\nrecrossed the frontier. He was not surprised at that result. Mazzini's\r\nattitude towards the Sardinian monarchy was perfectly well defined.\r\nRepublican himself, even to fanaticism, he placed the question of\r\nunity, which for him meant national existence, above the question of\r\nthe republic. He did not believe that the House of Savoy would unite\r\nItaly, but if unity could only be had under what he looked upon as the\r\ninauspicious form of monarchy, he would not reject it. He was like the\r\nreal mother in the judgment of Solomon, who, because she loved her\r\nchild, was ready to give it up sooner than see it cut in two.\r\n\r\nApart from personal hereditary instincts and predilections, Mazzini\r\nthought that he saw in the glorious memories of the Italian republics\r\na clear indication that the commonwealth was the form of government\r\nwhich ought and would be adopted by the Italy of the future. But,\r\nunlike most politicians, he laid down the principle that, after all,\r\nwhen free, the nation must decide for itself. 'To what purpose,' he\r\nasks, 'do we constantly speak of the sovereignty of the people, and of\r\nour reverence for the national will, if we are to disregard it as soon\r\nas it pronounces in contradiction to our wishes?'\r\n\r\nHe did not succeed in making the majority of his countrymen\r\nrepublicans, but he contributed more than any other man towards\r\ninspiring the whole country with the desire for unity. Herein lies his\r\ngreat work. Without Mazzini, when would the Italians have got beyond\r\nthe fallacies of federal republics, leagues of princes, provincial\r\nautonomy, insular home-rule, and all the other dreams of independence\r\nreft of its only safeguard which possessed the minds of patriots of\r\nevery party in Italy and of nearly every well-wisher to Italian\r\nfreedom abroad?\r\n\r\nIn 1831, most educated Italians did not even wish for unity, and this\r\nis still truer of the republicans than of the monarchists. Some, like\r\nManzoni, did wish for it, but, like him, said nothing about it, for\r\nfear of being thought madmen. A flash of the true light illuminated\r\nthe mind of Giro Menotti, but that was extinguished on the scaffold.\r\nThen it was that Mazzini came forward with the news that Italy could\r\n_only_ be made free and independent by being united; unity was the\r\nruling tendency of the century, and, as far as Italy went, no Utopia,\r\nbut a certain conclusion. This was repeated over and over again,\r\nwherever there were Italians, over the inhabited globe. By means of\r\nsailors, 'Young Italy' spread like lightning. Giuseppe Garibaldi was\r\nmade a member by a sailor on the shores of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nWith the masses, unity proved the wonder-working word which\r\nConfalonieri had said was the one thing needful--a word yet fitter to\r\nwork wonders than 'War to the Stranger.' Among the cultivated classes,\r\nit was much slower in gaining ground, and particularly among statesmen\r\nand diplomatists. But in the end it was to convert them all.\r\n\r\n'\"Young Italy,\"' writes Mazzini, 'closed the period of political\r\nsects, and initiated that of educational associations.' 'Great\r\nrevolutions,' he says again, 'are the work of principles rather than\r\nof bayonets.' It was by the diffusion of ideas that 'Young Italy'\r\nbecame a commanding factor in the events of the next thirty years.\r\nThe insurrectional attempts planned under its guidance did not\r\nsucceed, nor was it likely that they should succeed. Devised by\r\nexiles, at a distance, they lacked the first elements of success. The\r\nearliest of these attempts aimed at an invasion of Savoy; it was hoped\r\nthat the Sardinian army and people would join the little band of\r\nexiles in a movement for the liberation of Lombardy. The revolution of\r\n1821 had evidently suggested this plan to Mazzini, but it was\r\nforedoomed to misfortune. The Piedmontese authorities got wind of it,\r\nand a hunt followed for the members of 'Young Italy'; most severe\r\nmeasures were taken; there were eleven executions, and numberless\r\nsentences to long terms of imprisonment. Jacobo Ruffini, the younger\r\nbrother of the author of _Dr Antonio_, and Mazzini's most beloved\r\nfriend, committed suicide in prison, fearing to reveal the names of\r\nhis associates. The apologists for Charles Albert say that if he had\r\nnot shown the will and ability to deal severely with the conspirators,\r\nAustria would have insisted on a military occupation. Whatever were\r\nhis motives, this is the saddest page of his unhappy reign.\r\n\r\nChecked in 1833, the descent on Savoy was actually attempted in 1834,\r\nwith Mazzini's consent, though not by his wish. An officer who had won\r\nsome celebrity in the Polish revolution, General Ramorino, a Savoyard\r\nby origin, was given the command. Ramorino was a gambler, who could\r\nnot be trusted with money, but Mazzini's suspicion that on this\r\noccasion he played the part of traitor is not proved. However that may\r\nbe, the expedition ended almost as soon as it began. Ramorino crossed\r\nthe frontier of Savoy at the head of the column, but when he heard\r\nthat a Polish reinforcement had been stopped on the Lake of Geneva, he\r\nretreated into Switzerland, and advised the band to follow him.\r\n\r\nAfter these events, Mazzini could no longer carry on his propaganda in\r\nFrance. He took refuge in England, where a great part of his life was\r\nto be passed, and of which he spoke, to the last, as his second\r\ncountry. The first period of his residence in England was darkened by\r\nthe deep distress and discouragement into which the recent events had\r\nplunged him; but his faith in the future prevailed, and he went on\r\nwith his work. His endeavours to help his fellow-exiles reduced him to\r\nthe last stage of poverty; the day came when he was obliged to pawn a\r\ncoat and an old pair of boots. These money difficulties did not\r\nafflict him, and by degrees his writings in English periodicals\r\nbrought some addition to the small quarterly allowance which he\r\nreceived from his mother. It seems strange, though it is easily\r\nexplained, that it was in London that he first got to know the Italian\r\nworking classes. He was surprised and gladdened by the abundance of\r\ngood elements which he found in them. No country, indeed, has more\r\nreason to hope in her working men than the land whose sons have\r\ntunnelled the Alps, cut the most arduous railway lines in America and\r\nIndia, brought up English ships from the deep, laid the caissons (a\r\ntask of extreme danger) which support the great structure of the\r\nBridge of the Firth of Forth, and left their bones to whiten at\r\nPanama. 'It is the universal testimony,' writes a high American\r\nauthority, 'that no more faithful men have come among us.' What was\r\nthe cause of the slaughter of the Aigues Mortes? That the Italians\r\nworked too well.\r\n\r\nMazzini wrote for his humble friends the treatise on _The Duties of\r\nMan_, in which he told them that he loved them too well to flatter\r\nthem. Another work that occupied him and consoled him was the rescue\r\nand moral improvement of the children employed by organ-grinders, and\r\nhe was the first to call attention to the white slavery to which many\r\nof them were subjected. He opened a school in Hatton Garden, in which\r\nhe taught, and which he mainly supported for the seven years from 1841\r\nto 1848.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of the Brothers Bandiera belongs to the history of\r\n'Young Italy,' though Mazzini himself had tried to prevent it,\r\nbelieving that it could only end in the sacrifice of all concerned.\r\nNor, at the last, did the actors in it expect anything else. They had\r\nhoped for better things; for a general movement in the South of Italy,\r\nor at least for an undertaking on a larger and less irrational basis.\r\nBut promises failed, money was not forthcoming, and it was a choice\r\nbetween doing nothing or a piece of heroic folly. Contrary to\r\nMazzini's entreaties, they chose the second alternative.\r\n\r\nAttilio and Emilio Bandiera were sons of the Austrian admiral who, in\r\n1831, arrested Italian fugitives at sea. Placed by their father in the\r\nAustrian navy, they renounced every prospect of a brilliant career to\r\nenter the service of their down-trodden country. When they deserted,\r\nstrong efforts were made by the Archduke Rainieri, through their\r\nmother, to win them back, but neither the offers of pardon nor the\r\npoor woman's tears and reproaches turned them from their purpose.\r\nAnother deserter was with them, Lieutenant Domenico Moro, a youth of\r\ngreat charm of person and disposition, who had been employed with a\r\nmixed force of Englishmen and Austrians in the Lebanon, where he\r\nformed a warm friendship with Lieutenant, now Admiral, Sir George\r\nWellesley, who still preserves an affectionate remembrance of him.\r\nNicola Ricciotti, a Roman subject who had devoted all his life to\r\nItaly, and Anacarsi Nardi, son of the dictator of Modena, were also\r\nof the band, which counted about twenty.\r\n\r\nThe Bandieras and their companions sailed from Corfu for the coast of\r\nCalabria on the 11th of June 1844. 'If we fall,' they wrote to\r\nMazzini, 'tell our countrymen to imitate our example, for life was\r\ngiven to us to be nobly and usefully employed, and the cause for which\r\nwe shall have fought and died is the purest and holiest that ever\r\nwarmed the heart of man.' It was their last letter. After they landed\r\nin Calabria one of their number disappeared; there is every reason to\r\nsuppose that he went to betray them. They wandered for a few days in\r\nthe mountains, looking for the insurgent band which they had been\r\nfalsely told was waiting for them, and then fell into an ambush\r\nprepared by the Neapolitan troops. Some died fighting; nine were shot\r\nat Cosenza, including the Bandieras, Mori, Ricciotti and Nardi.\r\nBoccheciampi the Corsican, whom they suspected of treason, was brought\r\nup to be confronted with them during the trial; when asked if he knew\r\nwho he was, Nardi replied: 'I know no word in my divine Italian\r\nlanguage that can fitly describe that man.' Boccheciampi was condemned\r\nto a nominal imprisonment; when he came out of prison he wrote to a\r\nGreek girl of Corfu, to whom he was engaged, to join him at Naples,\r\nthat they might be married. The girl had been deeply in love with him,\r\nand had already given him part of her dowry, but she answered: 'A\r\ntraitor cannot wed a Greek maiden; I bear with me the blessing of my\r\nparents; upon you rests the curse of God.'\r\n\r\nThe martyrdom of the Bandieras made a great impression, especially in\r\nEngland, where the circumstance came to light that their\r\ncorrespondence with Mazzini had been tampered with in the English\r\nPost Office, and that information as to their plans had reached the\r\nAustrian and Neapolitan Governments through the British Foreign\r\nOffice. The affair was brought before the House of Commons by Thomas\r\nDuncombe. The Home Secretary repeated a calumny which had appeared\r\nmany years before in a French newspaper, to the effect that the murder\r\nof an Italian in Rodez by two of his fellow-countrymen was the result\r\nof an order from the Association of Young Italy. Sir James Graham had\r\nto apologise afterwards for 'the injury inflicted on Mr Mazzini' by\r\nthis statement, which he was obliged to admit was supported by no\r\nevidence, and was contrary to the opinion of the Judge who tried the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ having observed in a leading article that the gravity of\r\nthe fact in question, the violation of private correspondence in the\r\nPost Office, was not affected by the merits or demerits of Mr Mazzini,\r\nof whom it professed to 'know nothing,' Thomas Carlyle wrote next day\r\na letter containing words which may be quoted as some of the best and\r\ntruest ever written about the great Italian: 'I have had the honour to\r\nknow Mr Mazzini for a series of years, and, whatever I may think of\r\nhis practical insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great\r\nfreedom testify that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man of\r\ngenius and virtue, one of those rare men, numerable unfortunately but\r\nas units in this world, who are worthy to be called martyr souls; who\r\nin silence, piously in their daily life, understand and practise what\r\nis meant by that.' [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE POPE LIBERATOR\r\n\r\n1844-1847\r\n\r\nEvents leading to the Election of Pius IX.--The Petty Princes--Charles\r\nAlbert, Leopold and Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day is drawing near when the century which witnessed the\r\nliberation of Italy will have passed away. Already a generation has\r\ngrown up which can but faintly realise the passionate hopes and fears\r\nwith which the steps that led through defeat to the ultimate victory\r\nwere watched, not only by Italians, but by thousands who had never set\r\nfoot in Italy. Never did a series of political events evoke a sympathy\r\nso wide and so disinterested, and it may be foretold with confidence\r\nthat it never will again. Italy rising from the grave was the living\r\nromance of myriads of young hearts that were lifted from the common\r\nlevel of trivial interests and selfish ends, from the routine of work\r\nor pleasure, both deadening without some diviner spark, by a sustained\r\nenthusiasm that can hardly be imagined now. There were, indeed, some\r\nwho asked what was all this to them? What were the 'extraneous\r\nAustrian Emperor,' or the 'old chimera of a Pope' (Carlyle's\r\ndesignations) to the British taxpayer? Some there were in England who\r\nwere deeply attached still to the 'Great Hinge on which Europe\r\ndepended,' and even to the most clement Spanish Bourbons of Naples,\r\nabout whom strangely beautiful things are to be read in old numbers of\r\nthe _Quarterly Review_. But on the whole, English men and women--in\r\nmind half Italian, whether they will it or not, from the day they\r\nbegin to read their own literature from Chaucer to Shakespeare, from\r\nShakespeare to Shelley, from Shelley to Rossetti and Swinburne--were\r\nunited at that time in warmth of feeling towards struggling Italy as\r\nthey have been united in no political sentiment relating to another\r\nnation, and in few concerning their own country.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to expect that the record of Italian vicissitudes\r\nduring the years when the fate of Italy hung in the balance can awake\r\nor renew the spellbound interest caused by the events themselves. The\r\nreader of recent history is like the novel reader who begins at the\r\nlast chapter--he is too familiar with how it all ended to be keenly\r\naffected by the development of the plot. Yet it is plain that we are\r\nin a better position to appreciate the process of development than was\r\nthe case when the issue remained uncertain. We can estimate more\r\naccurately the difficulties which stood in the way, and judge more\r\nimpartially the means that were taken to remove them. One outcome of\r\nthis fuller knowledge is the conviction that patriotism was the\r\nmonopoly of no single Italian party. The leaders, and still more their\r\nhenchmen, were in the habit of saying very hard things about each\r\nother. It was natural and unavoidable; but there is no excuse now for\r\nfailing to recognise that there were pure and devoted patriots on the\r\none side as well as on the other--men whose only desire was the\r\nsalvation of Italy, to effect which no sacrifice seemed too great. Nor\r\nwere their labours unfruitful, for there was work for all of them to\r\ndo; and the very diversity of opinion, though unfortunate under some\r\naspects, was not so under all. If no one had raised the question of\r\nunity before all things, Italy might be still a geographical\r\nexpression. If no one had tried to wring concessions from the old\r\ngovernments, their inherent and irremediable vices would never have\r\nbeen proved; and though they might have been overturned, they would\r\nhave left behind a lasting possibility of ignorant reaction.\r\n\r\nThe Great Powers had presented to the Court of Rome in 1831 a\r\nmemorandum, in which various moderate reforms and improvements were\r\nproposed as urgently necessary to put an end to the intolerable abuses\r\nwhich were rife in the states of the Church, and, most of all, in\r\nRomagna. The abolition of the tribunal of the Holy Office, the\r\ninstitution of a Council of State, lay education, and the\r\nsecularisation of the administration were among the measures\r\nrecommended. In 1845 a certain Pietro Renzi collected a body of\r\nspirited young men at San Marino, and made a dash on Rimini, where he\r\ndisarmed the small garrison. The other towns were not prepared, and\r\nRenzi and his companions were obliged to retire into Tuscany; but the\r\nrevolution, partial as it had been, raised discussion in consequence\r\nof the manifesto issued by its promoters, in which a demand was made\r\nfor the identical reforms vainly advocated by European diplomacy\r\nfourteen years before. If these were granted, the insurgents engaged\r\nto lay down their arms. The manifesto was written by Luigi Carlo\r\nFarini, who was destined to play a large part in future affairs. It\r\nproved to Europe that even the most conservative elements in the\r\nnation were driven to revolution by the sheer hopelessness of the\r\ndead-lock which the Italian rulers sought by every means to prolong.\r\nMassimo d'Azeglio, who was then known only as a painter of talent and\r\na writer of historical novels, first made his mark as a politician by\r\nthe pamphlet entitled _Gli ultimi casi di Romagna_, in which his\r\narguments derived force from the fact that, when travelling in the\r\ndistrict, he had done all in his power to induce the Liberals to keep\r\nwithin the bounds of legality. But he confessed that, when someone\r\nsays: 'I suffer too much,' it is an unsatisfactory answer to retort:\r\n'You have not suffered enough.' Massimo d'Azeglio had lived for many\r\nyears an artist's life in Rome and the country round, where his\r\naristocratic birth and handsome face made him popular with all\r\nclasses. The transparent integrity of his nature overcame the\r\ndiffidence usually inspired by strangers among a somewhat suspicious\r\npeople, and he got to know more thoroughly than any other North\r\nItalian the real aspirations of the Pope's subjects. He listened to\r\ntheir complaints and their plans, and if they asked his advice, he\r\ninvariably replied: 'Let us speak clearly. What is it that you wish\r\nand I with you? You wish to have done with priestly rule, and to send\r\nthe Teutons out of Italy? If you invite them to decamp, they will\r\nprobably say, \"No, thank you!\" Therefore you must use force; and where\r\nis it to be had? If you have not got it, you must find somebody who\r\nhas. In Italy who has it, or, to speak more precisely, who has a\r\nlittle of it? Piedmont, because it, at least, enjoys an independent\r\nlife, and possesses an army and a surplus in the treasury.' His\r\nfriends answered: 'What of Charles Albert, of 1821, of 1832?' Now,\r\nthere was no one who felt less trust in Charles Albert than Massimo\r\nd'Azeglio; he admitted it with something like remorse in later years.\r\nBut he believed in his ambition, and he thought it madness to throw\r\naway what he regarded as the sole chance of freeing Italy on account\r\nof private doubts of the King of Sardinia's sincerity.\r\n\r\nCharles Albert had reigned for fourteen years, and still the mystery\r\nwhich surrounded his character formed as impenetrable a veil as ever.\r\nThe popular nickname of _Re Tentenna_ (King Waverer) seemed, in a\r\nsense, accepted by him when he said to the Duke d'Aumale in 1843: 'I\r\nam between the dagger of the Carbonari and the chocolate of the\r\nJesuits.' He chose, as bride for his eldest son, an Austrian princess,\r\nwho, however, had known no country but Italy. His internal policy was\r\nnot simply stationary, it was retrograde. If his consent was obtained\r\nto some progressive measure, he withdrew it at the last moment, or\r\ninsisted on the introduction of modifications which nullified the\r\nwhole. His want of stability drove one of his ministers to jump out of\r\na window. In spite of the candid reference to the Jesuit's cup of\r\nchocolate, he allowed the Society of Jesus to dictate its will in\r\nPiedmont. Victor Amadeus, the first King of Sardinia, took public\r\neducation out of the hands of the Jesuits, after receiving the\r\nfollowing deathbed communication from one of the Order who was his own\r\nconfessor: 'Deeply sensible of your many favours, I can only show my\r\ngratitude by a final piece of advice, but of such importance that\r\nperhaps it may suffice to discharge my debt. Never have a Jesuit for\r\nconfessor. Do not ask me the grounds of this advice, I should not be\r\nat liberty to tell them to you.' The lesson was forgotten now. Charles\r\nAlbert was not content to wear a hair-shirt himself; he would have\r\nliked to see all his subjects furnished with the same garment. The\r\nresult was, that Piedmont was not a comfortable place for Liberals to\r\nlive in, nor a lively place for anyone. Yet there is hardly anything\r\nmore certain than that all this time the King was constantly dreaming\r\nof turning the Austrians out of Italy. His government kept its\r\nattention fixed on two points: the improvement of the army, and the\r\naccumulation of a reserve fund to be available in case of war. Drill\r\nand thrift, which made the German Empire out of Prussia, if they did\r\nnot lead straight to equally splendid results south of the Alps, were\r\nstill what rendered it possible for Piedmont to defy Austria when the\r\ntime came. In 1840, Charles Albert wrote to his Minister of War: 'It\r\nis a fine thing to win twenty battles; as for me, I should be content\r\nto win ten on behalf of a cause I know of, and to fall in the\r\ntenth--then, indeed, I would die blessing the Lord.' A year or two\r\nlater, he unearthed and reassumed the ancient motto of the House of\r\nSavoy: 'J'attends mon astre.' Nevertheless, to the outward world his\r\nintentions remained enigmatical, and it was therefore with extreme\r\nsurprise that Massimo d'Azeglio (who, on his return from the Roman\r\nstates, asked permission to inform the King of the impressions made on\r\nhim by his travels) received the injunction to tell his Liberal\r\nfriends 'that when the occasion presented itself, his life, the life\r\nof his sons, his treasure, and his army would all be spent for the\r\nItalian cause.'\r\n\r\nThe fifteen years' pontificate of Gregory XVI. ended on the 1st June\r\nof 1846. In spite of the care taken by those around him to keep the\r\naged pontiff in a fool's paradise with regard to the real state of his\r\ndominions, a copy of _The Late Events in Romagna_ fell into his hands,\r\nand considerably disturbed his peace of mind. He sent two prelates to\r\nlook into the condition of the congested provinces, and their tour,\r\nthough it resulted in nothing else, called forth new protests and\r\nsupplications from the inhabitants, of which the most noteworthy was\r\nan address written by Count Aurelio Saffi, who was destined to pass\r\nmany honourable years of exile in England. This address attacked the\r\nroot of the evil in a passage which exposed the unbearable vexations\r\nof a government based on espionage. The acknowledged power of an\r\nirresponsible police was backed by the secret force of an army of\r\nprivate spies and informers. The sentiment of legality was being\r\nstamped out of the public conscience, and with it religion and\r\nmorality. 'Bishops have been heard to preach civil war--a crusade\r\nagainst the Liberals; priests seem to mix themselves in wretched party\r\nstrife, egging on the mob to vent its worst passions. There is not a\r\nCatholic country in which the really Christian priest is so rarely\r\nfound as in the States of the Church.'\r\n\r\nIf Gregory XVI. was not without reasons for disquietude in his last\r\nhours, he could take comfort in the fact that he had succeeded in\r\nkeeping railways out of all parts of his dominions. Gas and suspension\r\nbridges were also classed as works of the Evil One, and vigorously\r\ntabooed. Among the Pope's subjects there was a young prelate who had\r\nnever been able to make out what there was subversive to theology in a\r\nsteam-engine, or why the safety of the Papal government should depend\r\non its opposing every form of material improvement, although in\r\ndiscussing these subjects he generally ended by saying: 'After all I\r\nam no politician, and I may be mistaken.' This prelate was Cardinal\r\nMastai-Ferretti, Bishop of Imola. Born in 1792 at Sinigaglia, of a\r\ngood though rather needy family, Count Giovanni Maria Mastai was\r\npiously brought up by his mother, who dedicated him at an early age to\r\nthe Virgin, to whom she believed that she owed his recovery from an\r\nillness which had been pronounced fatal. Roman Catholic writers\r\nconnect the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception\r\nwith this incident of childhood. After entering the priesthood, young\r\nMastai devoted most of his energies to active charity, and remained,\r\nas he said, 'no politician,' being singularly ignorant of the world\r\nand of public affairs, though full of amiable wishes that everyone\r\nshould be happy. Some years spent in missionary work in South America\r\nfailed to enlarge his practical knowledge, the limits of which he was\r\nthe first to recognise--a fact that tended to make him all his life\r\nthe instrument, not of his own will, but of the wills of men whom he\r\nhonestly thought cleverer and more experienced than himself. His chief\r\nfriends in his Romagnol diocese, friends on the intimate basis of\r\nsocial equality and common provincial interests, were sound patriots,\r\nthough not revolutionists, and the future Pio Nono involuntarily\r\nadopted their ideas and sympathies. He saw with his eyes certain\r\nabuses so glaring that they admitted of no two opinions, and these\r\nhelped to convince him of the truth of his friends' arguments in\r\nfavour of a completely new order of things. One such abuse was the\r\nencouragement given by government to the Society of the Centurioni,\r\nthe latest evolution of the Calderai; the Centurions, recruited among\r\nroughs and peasants, were set upon the respectable middle classes,\r\nover which they tyrannised by secret accusations or open violence: it\r\nwas well understood that anyone called a Liberal, or Freemason, or\r\nCarbonaro could be beaten or killed without inquiries being made.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Imola was frequently in the house of the Count and\r\nCountess Pasolini, who kept their friend well supplied with the new\r\nbooks on Italian affairs; thus he read not only D'Azeglio's _Cast di\r\nRomagna_, but also Cesare Balbo's _Le Speranze d'Italia,_ which\r\npropounded a plan for an Italian federation, and Gioberti's _Primato\r\nmorale e civile degli Italiani_, in which this plan was elaborately\r\ndeveloped. Gioberti indicated the Supreme Pontiff as the natural head\r\nof the Italian Union, and the King of Sardinia as Italy's natural\r\ndeliverer from foreign domination. The eternal fitness of things, and\r\nthe history of many centuries, proved the Pope to be the proper\r\nparamount civil authority in Italy, 'which is the capital of Europe,\r\nbecause Rome is the religious metropolis of the world.' An ex-member\r\nof 'Young Italy,' a Piedmontese by birth, a priest by ordination,\r\nGioberti's profession of faith was derived from these three sources,\r\nand it attracted thousands of Italians by its apparent reconciliation\r\nof the interests of the papacy, and of the Sardinian monarchy, with\r\nthe most advanced views of the newest school. History, to which\r\nGioberti appealed, might have told him that a reversal of the law of\r\ngravity was as likely to happen as the performance by the papacy of\r\nthe mission he proposed to it; but men believe what they wish to\r\nbelieve, and his work found, as has been said, thousands of admirers,\r\namong whom none was more sincere than Cardinal Mastai. The day on\r\nwhich Count Pasolini gave him a copy of _Il Primato_ he created that\r\ngreat, and under some aspects pathetic illusion, the reforming Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Conclave opened on the 14th of June 1846. During the Bishop of\r\nImola's journey to Rome a white pigeon had perched several times on\r\nhis carriage. The story became known; people said the same thing had\r\noccurred to a coming Pope on former occasions, and the augury was\r\naccepted with joy and satisfaction. He was, in fact, elected after the\r\nConclave had lasted only two days, while the Conclave which elected\r\nhis predecessor lasted sixty-four. The brevity of that to which Pius\r\nIX. owed the tiara was looked upon by the populace as something\r\nmiraculous, but it was the result of the well-considered determination\r\nof the Italian Cardinals not to allow time for Austrian intrigues to\r\nobtain the election of a Pope who would be ruled from Vienna. When the\r\nnew Pope appeared on the balcony of the Quirinal to give his first\r\nbenediction, the people, carried away by his youthful yet majestic\r\nbearing, and by the hopes which already centred in him, broke into\r\nfrantic cries of: 'We have a Pope! He loves us! He is our Father!' If\r\nthey had cried: 'We have a new heaven and a new earth,' they would but\r\nhave expressed the delirium which, starting from Rome, spread\r\nthroughout Italy.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 6th of December 1846, the whole line of the\r\nApennines from Liguria to Calabria was illuminated. A hundred years\r\nbefore, a stone thrown by the child Balilla had given the signal for\r\nthe expulsion of the Austrians from Genoa: this was the memory\r\nflashed from height to height by countless beacons, but while\r\ncelebrating the past, they were the fiery heralds of a greater\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe upheaval of Europe did not become a fact, however, for another\r\nyear. Meantime, the Roman States attracted more attention than any\r\nother part of the peninsula, from the curiosity awakened by the\r\nprogress of the experiment of which they were the scene. It is not\r\ndoubtful that at the first moment Pius IX. was under the impression\r\nthat the problem he had taken in hand was eminently simple. A little\r\ngoodwill on the part of everybody, an amnesty to heal old sores, and a\r\nfew administrative reforms, ought, he thought, to set everything\r\nright. Such was not the opinion of intelligent onlookers who were\r\nstudents of politics--especially if they were foreigners, and could\r\ntherefore keep their heads moderately cool in the prevailing\r\nexcitement. The wave of a wand may seem to effect marvels, but long\r\nand silent causes prepare the way for each event. Now what had been\r\ngoing on for years in the Roman States was not the process of gradual\r\ngrowth, but the process of rapid disintegration. The Temporal Power of\r\nthe Popes had died without anyone noticing it, and there was nothing\r\nleft but a body in the course of dissolution. Every foreigner in Rome\r\nduring the reign of Gregory XVI. bore witness that his government\r\ndepended for its existence absolutely on the Swiss Guards. In 1845,\r\nCount Rossi told Guizot that without the Swiss regiments the\r\ngovernment in the Legations and the Marches 'would be overthrown in\r\nthe twinkling of an eye.' The British agent in Rome, writing during\r\nthe Conclave, bore this out by the statement, which applied not to one\r\nportion of the Roman states, but to all, that 'the government could\r\nnot stand without the protection of Austria and the immediate\r\npresence of the Swiss.' On the accession of Pius IX., the props, such\r\nas they were, which had prevented an earlier collapse of the Temporal\r\nPower, were either removed or rendered useless. The Swiss might as\r\nwell have been disbanded at once as retained merely to be a bone of\r\ncontention between the new government and the people, since it was\r\nunderstood that a vigorous use of their services would never be\r\nresorted to; while Austrian protection was transferred from the Pope\r\nto the disaffected party in the Church, which consisted in a large\r\nproportion of the cardinals and of the inferior clergy who were afraid\r\nthat, with the reform of abuses, they would lose their influence over\r\nthe lower class of their flocks. The English diplomatic agents in\r\nItaly also firmly believed that Austria coupled with her support of\r\nthe ultramontane malcontents the direct encouragement of the\r\ndisorderly elements of the population. To resist all these contrary\r\nforces, Pius IX. had only a popularity which, though for the time\r\nimmense, was founded almost completely on imagination. 'It was,' said\r\nMr Petre, 'the name and known views of Pius, rather than his acts,\r\nwhich aroused so much interest.' If for 'known views' be substituted\r\n'supposed views,' the remark exactly describes the situation.\r\n\r\nPopularity is very well, but a government cannot long subsist on the\r\nsingle fact of the popularity of the sovereign. When the Roman mob\r\nbegan to cry: 'Viva Pio Nono _solo_,' the fate of the experiment was\r\nsealed. Real control slipped from the hands that nominally wielded it.\r\n'The influence,' Mr Petre wrote to Sir George Hamilton, 'of one\r\nindividual of the lower class, Angelo Brunetti, hardly known but by\r\nhis nickname of Ciceruacchio, has for the last month kept the peace of\r\nthe city more than any power possessed by the authorities, from the\r\ncommand which he exerts over the populace.' It was Ciceruacchio who\r\npreserved order when in July 1847 the air was full of rumours of a\r\nvast reactionary plot, which aimed at carrying off the Pope, and\r\nputting things back as they were under Gregory. That such a plot was\r\never conceived, or, at anyrate, that it received the sanction of the\r\nhigh personages whose names were mentioned in connection with it, is\r\ngenerally doubted now; but it was believed in by many of the\r\nrepresentatives of foreign Powers then in Italy. The public mind in\r\nRome was violently disturbed. Austria made the excitement the excuse\r\nfor occupying the town of Ferrara, where, by the accepted\r\ninterpretation of the Treaty of Vienna, she had only the right to\r\ngarrison the fortress. This aggression called forth a strong\r\nremonstrance from the Pope's Secretary of State, Cardinal Ferretti;\r\nand though a compromise was arrived at through the mediation of Lord\r\nPalmerston, the feeling against Austria grew more and more exasperated\r\nin the Roman states, and the Pope consented, not, it seemed, much\r\nagainst the grain, to preparations being taken in hand with a view to\r\nthe possible eventuality of war.\r\n\r\nAt this date the Italian question was better apprehended at Vienna\r\nthan in any other part of Europe. A man of Prince Metternich's talents\r\ndoes not devote a long life to statecraft without learning to\r\ndistinguish the real drift of political currents. While Lord\r\nPalmerston still felt sure that reforms, and nothing but reforms, were\r\nwhat Italy wanted, Prince Metternich saw that two real forces were at\r\nwork from the Alps to the Straits of Messina, and two only: desire for\r\nunion, hatred of Austria. Nor was it his fault if the English Cabinet\r\nor the rest of the world remained unenlightened. Besides enlarging on\r\nthis truth in frequent diplomatic communications, he caused it to be\r\ncontinually dwelt upon in the Vienna _Observer_, the organ of the\r\nAustrian Government, which printed illustrative quotations from the\r\nwritings of Mazzini, of whom it said that 'he has the one merit of\r\ndespising hypocrisy, and proceeding firmly and directly to his true\r\nend. Persons who are versed in history will know that this is exactly\r\nthe same end as that at which Arnold of Brescia and Cola di Rienzi\r\nformerly aimed. The only difference is, that the revolutionary dream\r\nhas in the course of centuries gained in self-reliance and\r\nconfidence.' It may truly be affirmed after this that Metternich 'had\r\nthe one merit of despising hypocrisy.' Exactly the same end as Arnold\r\nof Brescia and Cola di Rienzi--who better could have described the\r\nscheme of Italian redemption?\r\n\r\nIn the course of the summer of 1847, the Prince said more than once to\r\nthe British Ambassador: 'The Emperor is determined not to lose his\r\nItalian dominions.' It was no idle boast, the speaker felt confident,\r\nthat the troops in Lombardy and Venetia could keep those provinces\r\nfrom taking an active part in the 'revolution' which he declared to be\r\nalready complete over all central Italy, though the word revolution\r\nhad never yet been mentioned. Nor was it only in the Austrian army\r\nthat he trusted; Metternich was persuaded that neither in Lombardy nor\r\nin Venetia was there any fear of a really popular and, therefore,\r\nformidable movement. He believed that Austria's only enemy was the\r\naristocracy. He even threw out hints that if the Austrian Government\r\ncondescended to do so, it could raise a social or peasants' war of the\r\ncountry people against their masters. This is the policy which has\r\nbeen elaborately followed by the Russians in Poland. The Austrians\r\npointed to their virtue in not resorting to it; but some tentative\r\nexperiments in such a direction had not given results of a kind to\r\nencourage them to go on. The Italian peasant, though ignorant, had a\r\nfar quicker innate intelligence than his unfortunate Polish brother.\r\nHe did not dislike his masters, who treated him at least with easy\r\nfamiliarity, and he detested foreigners--those foreigners, no matter\r\nof what nation, who for two thousand years had brought the everlasting\r\ncurse of war upon his fields. The conscription, which carried off his\r\nsons for eight years into distant lands, of which he could not\r\npronounce the name, was alone enough to alienate him from the Austrian\r\nGovernment. In hoping to find a friend in the Italian peasant,\r\nMetternich reckoned without his host. On the other hand, he was\r\nstrictly correct in his estimate of the patriotism of the aristocracy.\r\nThe fact always seemed to the Prince a violation of eternal laws.\r\nAccording to him, the fore-ordained disaffected in every country were\r\ndrawn from the middle classes. What business had noblemen with ancient\r\nnames and fine estates to prefer Spielberg to their beautiful palaces\r\nand fairy-like villas on the Lombard lakes? Was it on purpose to spite\r\nthe best of governments, and the one most favourable to the\r\naristocratic principle, which had always held out paternal hands to\r\nthem? Could anything be imagined more aggravating?\r\n\r\nThis feature in Italian liberation has been kept mostly in the\r\nbackground. Democratic chroniclers were satisfied to ignore it, and to\r\nthe men themselves their enormous sacrifices seemed so natural that\r\nthey were very willing to let them pass out of mind. It is in the\r\nworks of those who, while sympathising with Italy, are not Italians,\r\nthat the best record of it is to be found; nowhere better than in a\r\nrecent book by a French writer, M. Paul Bourget, in which occurs the\r\nfollowing just and eloquent tribute: 'We must say in praise of the\r\naristocracy on this side of the Alps that the best soldiers of\r\nindependence were nobles. If Italy owes the final success to the\r\nsuperior capabilities of Victor Emmanuel and Cavour, and to the\r\nagitating power of the General of the Thousand, it is well not to\r\nforget the struggles sustained for years by gentlemen whose example\r\ndid so much to raise partisans among the humble. These aristocrats,\r\npassionate for liberty, have (like our own of the eighteenth century)\r\ndone more for the people than the people itself. The veritable history\r\nof this _Risorgimento_ would be in great part that of the Italian\r\nnobility in which the heroic blood of feudal chiefs revolted against\r\nthe oppressions and, above all, the perpetual humiliation, born of the\r\npresence of the stranger.'\r\n\r\nWhen Prince Metternich looked beyond the borders of those provinces\r\nwhich he said that his Sovereign did not intend to lose, he saw sooner\r\nthan most people that a ball was set rolling which would not stop half\r\nway down the hill. The one element in the situation which came as a\r\nsurprise to him, was that introduced by Pius IX. 'A liberal Pope is an\r\nimpossible being!' he exclaimed. Nevertheless this impossible being was\r\na reality which had to be dealt with. He hoped all along, however, that\r\nPius would fall a victim to the Frankenstein he had called into\r\nexistence, and his only real anxiety lay where it had always lain--on\r\nthe side of Piedmont. 'Charles Albert ought to let us know,' he wrote to\r\nthe Austrian Minister at Turin, 'whether his reign has been only a mask\r\nunder which was hidden the Prince of Carignano, who ascended the throne\r\nthrough the order of succession re-established in his favour by the\r\nEmperor Francis.' Considering all things, the endeavour to make it\r\nappear that the King was indebted for his crown to Austria was somewhat\r\nventuresome. Charles Albert, Metternich went on to say, had to choose\r\nbetween two systems, the system now in force, or 'the crassest\r\nrevolution.' He wrote again: 'The King is sliding back upon the path\r\nwhich he enters for the second time in his life, _and which he will\r\nnever really quit_.' Words of a bitter enemy, but juster than the\r\n'Esecrato o Carignano,' hurled for a quarter of a century at Charles\r\nAlbert by those who only saw in him a traitor.\r\n\r\nThe constant invocation of the revolutionary spectre by the Austrian\r\nstatesman convinced the King that the wish was father to the thought,\r\nand, afraid of introducing the thin end of the wedge, he showed\r\nhimself more than ever averse to reforming the antiquated machinery of\r\nthe Sardinian Government. Instead of being the first of Italian\r\nprinces to yield to popular demands, he was almost the last. He\r\nbelieved that the question of nationality, of independence, could be\r\nseparated from the question of free institutions. Of all the\r\nchimerical ideas then afloat, this was the most chimerical. Even the\r\nexample of the Pope, for whom Charles Albert felt a romantic devotion,\r\nwas not enough to induce him to open the road to reforms. The person\r\nwho seems first to have impressed him with their absolute necessity\r\nwas Lord Minto, whose visit to Turin, in October 1847, coincided with\r\nthe dismissal of Count della Margherita, the minister most closely\r\nassociated with the absolutist and Jesuitical _régime_. Lord Minto was\r\nsent to Italy to encourage in the ways of political virtue those\r\nItalian princes who were not entirely incorrigible. His mission\r\nexcited exaggerated hopes on the part of the Liberals, and exaggerated\r\nwrath in the retrograde party--both failing to understand its\r\nlimitations. The hopes died a natural death, but long afterwards,\r\nreactionary writers attributed all the 'troubles' in Italy to this\r\nestimable British diplomatist. What is not doubtful is, that,\r\naccustomed as they were to being lectured and bullied by foreign\r\ncourts, the Italians derived the greatest encouragement from the\r\nopenly expressed sympathy of well-known English visitors, whether they\r\ncame in an official capacity like Lord Minto, or unofficially like Mr\r\nCobden, who travelled as a missionary of Free Trade, and was received\r\nwith rapture--with which, it is to be feared, Free Trade had little to\r\ndo--by the leading Liberals in Italy: Massimo d'Azeglio at Genoa,\r\nMancini at Naples Cavour and Scialoja at Turin, Minghetti at Bologna,\r\nRidolfi at Florence, and Manin and Tommaseo at Venice.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1847, there was a curious shuffling of the cards in\r\nthe small states of Lucca and Parma, resulting in much irritation,\r\nwhich, in an atmosphere so charged with revolutionary electricity, was\r\nnot without importance. The dissolute Bourbon prince who reigned in\r\nLucca, Charles Ludovico, had but one desire, which was to increase his\r\ncivil list. He hit upon an English jockey named Ward, who came to\r\nItaly in the service of a German count, and this person he made his\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer. By various luminous strokes, Ward\r\nfurthered his Sovereign's object without much increasing the taxation,\r\nand when matters began to grow complicated, and here, too, a cry was\r\nraised for a Constitution (which had been solemnly guaranteed to the\r\npeople of Lucca at the Congress of Vienna, but had never been heard of\r\nsince), he proposed the sale of the Duchy off-hand to Tuscany, with\r\nwhich it would, in any case, be united, when, on the death of the\r\nex-Empress Marie-Louise, the Duchy of Parma devolved on the Duke of\r\nLucca. At the same time, by a prior agreement, a district of Tuscany\r\ncalled the Lunigiana was consigned, one-half to the Duchess of Parma,\r\nand the other to the Duke of Modena. The indignation of the\r\npopulation, which was made, by force, subject to the Duke of Modena,\r\nwas intense, and the whole transaction of handing about Italians to\r\nsuit the pleasure of princes, or to obey the articles of forgotten\r\ntreaties, reminded the least sensitive of the everyday opprobrium of\r\ntheir lot.\r\n\r\nThe bargain with Tuscany had been struck only eight days when\r\nMarie-Louise died--unlamented, since the latter years of her reign\r\nformed a sad contrast to the earlier. Marie-Louise had not a bad\r\ndisposition, but she always let her husband of the hour govern as he\r\nchose; of the four or five of these husbands, the last two, and\r\nparticularly the hated Count de Bombelles, undid all the good done by\r\ntheir more humane predecessors. The Parmese petitioned their new Duke\r\nto send the man away, and to grant them some measure of freedom. The\r\nanswer he gave was the confirmation of Bombelles in all his honours,\r\nand the conclusion of a treaty with Austria, securing the assistance\r\nof her arms. A military force had been sent to Parma to escort the\r\nbody of the late Duchess to Vienna; but on the principle that the\r\nliving are of more consequence than the dead, it remained there to\r\nprotect the new Duke from his subjects. Marie-Louise and her lovers,\r\nCharles Ludovico and his jockey-minister, are instructive\r\nillustrations of the scandalous point things had reached in the small\r\nstates of Italy.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, one state in which, though the dynasty was\r\nAustrian, the government was conducted without ferocity and without\r\nscandal. This was Tuscany. The branch of the Hapsburg-Lorraine family\r\nestablished in Tuscany produced a series of rulers who, if they\r\nexhibited no magnificent qualities, were respectable as individuals,\r\nand mild as rulers. Giusti dubbed Leopold II. 'the Tuscan Morpheus,\r\ncrowned with poppies and lettuce leaves,' and the clear intelligence\r\nof Ricasoli was angered by the languid, let-be policy of the\r\nGrand-Ducal government, but, compared with the other populations of\r\nItaly, the Tuscans might well deem themselves fortunate. Only on one\r\noccasion had the Grand Duke given up a fugitive from the more favoured\r\nprovinces, and the presence of distinguished exiles lent brilliancy to\r\nhis capital. Leopold II. hesitated between the desire to please his\r\nsubjects and the fear of his Viennese relations, who sent him through\r\nMetternich the ominous reminder, 'that the Italian Governments had\r\nonly subsisted for the last ten years by the support they received\r\nfrom Austria'--an assertion at which Charles Albert took umbrage, but\r\nhe was curtly told that he was not intended. In spite of his fears,\r\nhowever, the Grand Duke instituted a National Guard on the 4th of\r\nSeptember, which was correctly judged the augury of further\r\nconcessions. In August, the Austrian Minister had distinctly\r\nthreatened to occupy Tuscany, or any other of the Italian duchies\r\nwhere a National Guard was granted; its institution was therefore\r\ninterpreted as a decisive act of rebellion against the Imperial\r\ndictatorship. The red, white and green tricolor, not yet permitted in\r\nPiedmont, floated already from all the towers of the city on the Arno.\r\n\r\nWhere there were no signs of improvement was in the government of the\r\nTwo Sicilies. King Ferdinand undertook a journey through several parts\r\nof the country, but as Lord Napier, the British Minister, expressed\r\nit: 'Exactly where the grace of the royal countenance was principally\r\nconferred, the rebels sprung up most thickly.' A revolution was\r\nplanned to break out in all the cities of the kingdom, but the project\r\nonly took effect at Messina and at Reggio, and in both places the\r\nmovement was stifled with prompt and barbarous severity. When the\r\nleader of the Calabrian attempt, Domenico Romeo, a landed proprietor,\r\nwas caught on the heights of Aspromonte, his captors, after cutting\r\noff his head, carried it to his young nephew, whom they ordered to\r\ntake it to Reggio with the cry of 'Long live the King.' The youth\r\nrefused, and was immediately killed. In the capital, Carlo Poerio and\r\nmany patriots were thrown into prison on suspicion. Settembrini had\r\njust time to escape to Malta.\r\n\r\nThe year 1847 closed amid outward appearances of quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE YEAR OF REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n1848\r\n\r\nInsurrection in Sicily--The Austrians expelled from Milan and\r\nVenice--Charles Albert takes the Field--Withdrawal of the Pope and King\r\nof Naples--Piedmont defeated--The Retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of January, the birthday of the King of the Two Sicilies,\r\nanother insurrection broke out in Sicily; this time it was serious\r\nindeed. The City of the Vespers lit the torch which set Europe on\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nSo began the year of revolution which was to see the kings of the\r\nearth flying, with or without umbrellas, and the principle of monarchy\r\nmore shaken by the royal see-saw of submission and vengeance than ever\r\nit was by the block of Whitehall or the guillotine of the Place Louis\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the errors and follies of that year were not confined to\r\nprinces and governments, but it will remain memorable as the time when\r\nthe Italian nation, not a dreamer here or there, or a handful of\r\nheroic madmen, or an isolated city, but the nation as a whole, with an\r\nunanimity new in history, asserted its right and its resolve to exist.\r\n\r\nKing Ferdinand sent 5000 soldiers to 'make a garden,' as he described\r\nit, of Palermo, if the offers sent at the same time failed to pacify\r\nthe inhabitants. These offers were refused with the comment: 'Too\r\nlate,' and the Palermitans prepared to resist to the death under the\r\nguidance of the veteran patriot Ruggiero Settimo, Prince of Fitalia.\r\n'Separation,' they said, 'or our English Constitution of 1812.'\r\nIncreased irritation was awakened by the discovery in the head office\r\nof the police at Palermo of a secret room full of skeletons, which\r\nwere supposed to belong to persons privately murdered. The Neapolitans\r\nwere compelled to withdraw with a loss of 3000 men, but before they\r\nwent, the general in command let out 4000 convicts, who had been kept\r\nwithout food for forty-eight hours. The convicts, however, did not\r\nfulfil the intentions of their liberator, and did but little mischief.\r\nNot so the Neapolitan troops, who committed horrors on the peasantry\r\nas they retreated, which provoked acts of retaliation almost as\r\nbarbarous. In a short time all Sicily was in its own hands except the\r\ncitadel of Messina.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to follow the Sicilians in their long struggle for\r\ntheir autonomy. They stood out for some fourteen months. An English\r\nBlue-book is full of the interminable negotiations conducted by Lord\r\nNapier and the Earl of Minto in the hope of bringing the strife to an\r\nend. When the parliament summoned by the revolutionary government\r\ndeclared the downfall of the House of Bourbon, all the stray princes\r\nin Europe, including Louis Napoleon, were reviewed as candidates for\r\nthe throne. The choice fell on the Duke of Genoa; it was well received\r\nin England, and the British men-of-war were immediately ordered to\r\nsalute the Sicilian flag. But the Duke's reign never became a reality.\r\nAfter an heroic struggle, the islanders were subjugated in the spring\r\nof 1849.\r\n\r\nSo stout a fight for independence must win admiration, if not\r\napproval. The political reasons against the course taken by the\r\nSicilians have been suggested in a former chapter. In separating their\r\nlot from that of Naples, in rejecting even freedom unless it was\r\naccompanied by disruption, they hastened the ruin of the Neapolitans\r\nand of themselves, and surely played into the hands of the crafty\r\ntyrant who desired nothing better than to fish in the troubled waters\r\nof his subjects' dissensions.\r\n\r\nIn the gathering storm of January 1848, the first idea that occurred\r\nto Ferdinand II. was the good old plan of calling in Austrian\r\nassistance. But the Austrians were told by Pius IX. that he would not\r\nallow their troops to pass through his territory. Had they attempted\r\nto pass in spite of his warning, events would have taken a different\r\nturn, as the Pope would have been driven into a war with Austria then\r\nand there; perhaps he would have been glad, as weak people commonly\r\nare, of the compulsion to do what he dared not do without compulsion.\r\nThe Austrian Government was too wise to force a quarrel; it was easy\r\nto lock up Austrian subjects for crying 'Viva Pio Nono,' but the\r\nenormous importance of keeping the Head of the Church, if possible, in\r\na neutral attitude could not be overlooked. All thoughts of going to\r\nFerdinand's help were politely abandoned, and he, seeing himself in a\r\ndefenceless position, and pondering deeply on the upsetting of Louis\r\nPhilippe's throne, which was just then the latest news, decided on\r\nthat device, dear to all political conjurors, which is known as taking\r\nthe wind out of your enemy's sails. The Pope, the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany and the King of Sardinia, had worried him for six months with\r\nadmonitions. 'Very well,' he now said; 'they urge me forward, I will\r\nprecipitate them.' Constitution, representative government, unbridled\r\nliberty of the press, a civic guard, the expulsion of the Jesuits;\r\nwhat mattered a trifle more or less when everything could be revoked\r\nat the small expense of perjury? Ferdinand posed to perfection in the\r\ncharacter of Citizen King. He reassured those who ventured to show the\r\nleast signs of apprehension by saying: 'If I had not intended to carry\r\nout the Statute, I should not have granted it.'\r\n\r\nNot many days later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the King of\r\nSardinia each promulgated a Charter. In the case of Charles Albert, it\r\nhad been formally promised on the 8th of February, after sleepless\r\nnights, severe fasts, much searching of the heart--contrasting\r\nstrangely with the gay transformation scene at Naples; but promises\r\nhave a more serious meaning to some persons than to others. Nor did\r\nCharles Albert take any pleasure in the shouts of a grateful people.\r\n'Born in revolution,' he once wrote, 'I have traversed all its phases,\r\nand I know well enough what popularity is worth--_viva_ to-day,\r\n_morte_ to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nIn the Lombardo-Venetian provinces all seemed still quiet, but the\r\nbrooding discontent of the masses increased with the increasing\r\naggressiveness of the Austrian soldiers, while the refusal to grant\r\nthe studiously moderate demands of men like Nazari of Bergamo and\r\nManin and Tommasco of Venice, who were engaged in a campaign of legal\r\nagitation, brought conviction to the most cautious that no measure of\r\npolitical liberty was obtainable under Austrian rule.\r\n\r\nAt the Scala Theatre some of the audience had raised cries of 'Viva\r\nPio Nono' during a performance of _I Lombardi._[3] This was the excuse\r\nfor prohibiting every direct or indirect public reference to the\r\nreigning Pontiff. Nevertheless, a few young men were caught singing\r\nthe Pope's hymn, upon which the military charged the crowd. On the 3rd\r\nof January the soldiers fell on the people in the Piazza San Carlo,\r\nkilling six and wounding fifty-three. The parish priest of the Duomo\r\nsaid that he had seen Russians, French and Austrians enter Milan as\r\ninvaders; but a scene like that of the 3rd of January he had never\r\nwitnessed; 'they simply murdered in the streets.'\r\n\r\nThe _Judicium Statuarium_, equivalent to martial law, was proclaimed\r\nin February; but the Viennese revolution of the 8th of March, and\r\nPrince Metternich's flight to England, were followed by promises to\r\nabolish the censure, and to convoke the central congregations of the\r\nLombardo-Venetian kingdom. The utmost privilege of these assemblies\r\nwas consultative. In 1815 they were invested with the right to 'make\r\nknown grievances,' but they had only once managed to perform this\r\nmodest function. It was hardly worth while to talk about them on the\r\n18th of March 1848.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of that day, Count O'Donnel, the Vice-Governor of\r\nMilan, announced the Emperor's concessions. Before night he was the\r\nhostage of the revolution, signing whatever decrees were demanded of\r\nhim till in a few hours even his signature was dispensed with. The\r\nMilanese had begun their historic struggle.\r\n\r\nTaking refuge in the Citadel, Radetsky wrote to the Podestà, Count\r\nGabrio Casati (brother of Teresa Confalonieri), that he acknowledged\r\nno authority at Milan except his own and that of his soldiers. Those\r\nwho resisted would be guilty of high treason. If arguments did not\r\navail, he would make use of all the means placed in his hands by an\r\narmy of 100,000 men to bring the rebel city to obedience. Unhappily\r\nfor Radetsky, there were not any such 100,000 men in Italy, though\r\nlong before this he had told Metternich that he could not guarantee\r\nthe safety of Lombardy with less than 150,000. In spite of partial\r\nreinforcements, the number did not amount to more than from 72,000 to\r\n75,000, while at Milan it stood at between 15,000 and 20,000. But if\r\nwe take the lower estimate, 15,000 regular troops under such a\r\ncommander, who, most rare in similar emergencies, knew his own mind,\r\nand had no thought except the recovery of the town for his Sovereign,\r\nconstituted a formidable force against a civilian population, which\r\nbegan the fight with only a few hundred fowling-pieces. The odds on\r\nthe side of Austria were tremendous.\r\n\r\nIf the Milan revolt had been one of the customary revolutions,\r\narranged with the help of pen and paper, its first day would have been\r\ncertainly its last. But even more than the Sicilian Vespers, it was\r\nthe unpremeditated, irresistible act of a people sick of being slaves.\r\nAt the beginning Casati tried to restrain it; so, with equal or still\r\nstronger endeavours, did the republican Carlo Cattaneo, whose\r\ninfluence was great. 'You have no arms,' he said again and again. Not\r\na single man of weight took upon himself the awful responsibility of\r\nurging the unarmed masses upon so desperate an enterprise; but when\r\nthe die was cast none held back. Initiated by the populace, the revolt\r\nwas led to its victorious close by the nerve and ability of the\r\ninfluential men who directed its course.\r\n\r\nTowards nightfall on the 18th, during which day there had been only\r\nscuffles between the soldiers and the people, Radetsky took the\r\nBroletto, where the Municipality sat, after a two hours' siege, and\r\nsent forthwith a special messenger to the Emperor with the news that\r\nthe revolution was on a fair way to being completely crushed.\r\nMeanwhile, he massed his troops at all the entrances to the city, so\r\nthat at dawn he might strangle the insurrection by a concentric\r\nmovement, as in a noose. The plan was good; but to-morrow does not\r\nbelong even to the most experienced of Field-Marshals.\r\n\r\nIn all quarters of the city barricades sprang up like mushrooms.\r\nEverything went, freely given, to their construction; the benches of\r\nthe Scala, the beds of the young seminarists, the court carriages,\r\nfound hidden in a disused church, building materials of the\r\nhalf-finished Palazzo d'Adda, grand pianofortes, valuable pieces of\r\nartistic furniture, and the old kitchen table of the artisan. Before\r\nthe end of the fight the barricades numbered 1523. Young nobles,\r\ndressed in the velvet suits then in vogue, cooks in their white\r\naprons, even women and children, rushed to the defence of the\r\nimprovised fortifications. Luciano Manara and other heroes, who\r\nafterwards fell at Rome, were there to lead. In the first straits for\r\nwant of arms the museums of the Uboldi and Poldi-Pozzoli families were\r\nemptied of their rare treasures by permission of the owners; the crowd\r\nbrandished priceless old swords and specimens of early firearms. More\r\nserviceable weapons were obtained by degrees from the Austrian killed\r\nand wounded, and from the public offices which fell into their hands.\r\nBolza, long the hated agent of the Austrian police, was discovered by\r\nthe people, but they did not harm him. Throughout the five days, the\r\nMilanese showed a forbearance which was the more admirable, because\r\nthere can be no doubt that when the Austrians found they were getting\r\nthe worst of it, they vented their rage in deplorable outrages on\r\nnon-combatants. That Radetsky was personally to blame for these\r\nexcesses has never been alleged, and it was perhaps beyond the power\r\nof the officers to keep discipline among soldiers who, towards the\r\nend, were wild with panic.\r\n\r\n'The very foundations of the city were torn up,' wrote the\r\nField-Marshal in his official report; 'not hundreds, but thousands of\r\nbarricades crossed the streets. Such circumspection and audacity were\r\ndisplayed that it was evident military leaders were at the head of the\r\npeople. The character of the Milanese had become quite changed.\r\nFanaticism had seized every rank and age and both sexes.'\r\n\r\nAs always happens with street-fighting, the number of the slain has\r\nnever been really known; the loss of the citizens was small compared\r\nwith that of the Austrians, who, according to some authorities, lost\r\n5000, between killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nRadetsky ordered the evacuation of the town and citadel on the night\r\nof Wednesday, the 22nd of March. The Milanese had won much more than\r\nfreedom--they had won the right to it. And what they had done they had\r\ndone alone. When the news that the capital was up in arms spread\r\nthrough Lombardy, there was but one gallant impulse, to fly to its\r\naid. But the earliest to arrive, Giuseppe Martinengo Cesaresco, with\r\nhis troop of Brescian peasants, found when he reached Milan that they\r\nwere a few hours too late to share in the last shots fired upon the\r\nretreating Austrians.\r\n\r\nNowhere, except in Milan, did the revolution meet with a Radetsky. The\r\nAustrian authorities became convinced that their position was\r\nuntenable, and they desired to avoid a useless sacrifice of life.\r\nThis, rather than cowardly fears, was the motive which induced Count\r\nPalffy and Count Zichy, the civil and military governors of Venice, to\r\nyield the city without deluging it in blood. The latter had been\r\nguilty of negligence in leaving the Venetian arsenal in charge of\r\ntroops so untrustworthy that Manin could take it on the 22nd of March\r\nby a simple display of his own courage, and without striking a blow,\r\nbut after this first success on the side of the revolution, which\r\nsupplied the people with an unlimited stock of arms and ammunition,\r\nthe Austrians did well to give way even from their own point of view.\r\nAt seven o'clock on the evening of the 22nd of March, the famous\r\ncapitulation was signed. Manin's prediction of the previous day,\r\n'To-morrow the city will be in my power, or I shall be dead,' had been\r\nrealised in the first alternative.\r\n\r\nDaniel Manin, who was now forty-four years of age, was by profession a\r\nlawyer, by race a Jew. His father became a Christian, and, according\r\nto custom, took the surname of his godfather, who belonged to the\r\nfamily of the last Doge of Venice. Manin and the Dalmatian scholar,\r\nNiccolò Tommaseo, had been engaged in patiently adducing proof after\r\nproof that Austria did not even abide by her own laws when the\r\nexpression of political opinion was concerned. At the beginning of the\r\nrevolution they were in prison, and Palffy's first act of surrender\r\nwas to set them free. Henceforth Manin was undisputed lord of the\r\ncity. It is strange how, all at once, a man who was only slightly\r\nknown to the world should have been chosen as spokesman and ruler. It\r\ndid not, however, happen by chance. The people in Italy are observant;\r\nthe Venetians had observed Manin, and they trusted him. The power of\r\ninspiring trust was what gave this Jewish lawyer his ascendancy, not\r\nthe talents which usually appeal to the masses. He had not the\r\nadvantage of an imposing presence, for he was short, slight, with blue\r\neyes and bushy hair; in all things he was the opposite to a demagogue;\r\nhe never beguiled, or flattered, or told others what he did not\r\nbelieve himself. But, on his side, he _knew_ the people, whom most\r\nrevolutionary leaders know not at all. 'That is my sole merit,' he\r\nused to say. It was that which enabled him to cleanse Venice from the\r\nstain of having bartered her freedom for the smile of a conqueror, and\r\ngive her back the name and inheritance of 'eldest child of liberty.'\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of course that emancipated Venice should assume a\r\nrepublican form of government. Here the republic was a restoration. At\r\nMilan the case was different; there were two parties, that of\r\nCattaneo, which was strongly republican, that of Casati, which was\r\nstrongly monarchical. There was a third party, which thought of\r\nnothing except of never again seeing a soldier with a white coat. By\r\nmutual agreement, the Provisional Government declared that the\r\ndecision as to the form of government should be left to calmer days.\r\nFor a time this compromise produced satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe revolution gained ground. Francis of Modena executed a rapid flight,\r\nand the Duke of Parma presently followed him. By the end of March,\r\nLombardy and Venetia were free, saving the fortresses of the\r\nQuadrilateral. The exception was of far greater moment than, in the\r\nenchantment of the hour, anyone dreamt of confessing. Mantua, Legnano,\r\nPeschiera and Verona were so many cities of refuge to the flying\r\nAustrian troops, where they could rest in safety and nurse their\r\nstrength. Still, the results achieved were great, almost incredible;\r\nwith the expectation that Rome, Naples, Tuscany and Piedmont would send\r\ntheir armies to consolidate the work already done, it was natural to\r\nthink that, whatever else might happen, Austrian dominion was a thing of\r\nthe past. Alessandro Bixio (brother of the General), who was a\r\nnaturalised Frenchman, wrote to the French Government on the 7th of\r\nApril from Turin: 'In the ministries, in meetings, in the streets, you\r\nonly see and hear people to whom the question of Italian independence\r\nseems to be one of those historical questions about which the time is\r\npast for talking. According to the general opinion, Austria is nothing\r\nbut a phantom, and the army of Radetsky a shadow.' Such were the hopes\r\nthat prevailed. They were vain, but they did not appear so then.\r\n\r\nPius IX. seemed to throw in his lot definitely with the revolution\r\nwhen, on the 19th of March, he too granted a Constitution, having\r\npreviously formed a lay ministry, which included Marco Minghetti and\r\nCount Pasolini, under the presidency of Cardinal Antonelli, who thus\r\nmakes his first appearance as Liberal Premier. That the Roman\r\nConstitution was an unworkable attempt to reconcile lay and\r\necclesiastical pretensions, that the proposed Chamber of Deputies,\r\nwhich was not to make laws affecting education, religious\r\ncorporations, the registration of births and marriages; or to confer\r\ncivil rights on non-catholics, or to touch the privileges and\r\nimmunities of the clergy, might have suited Cloud-cuckoo-town, but\r\nwould not suit the solid earth, were facts easy to recognise, but no\r\none had time to pause and consider. It was sufficient to hear Pius\r\nproclaim that in the wind which was uprooting oaks and cedars might be\r\nclearly distinguished the Voice of the Lord. Such utterances, mingled\r\nwith blessings on Italy, brought balm to patriotic souls. The Liberals\r\nhad no fear that the Pope would veto the participation of his troops\r\nin the national war, for they were blind to the complications with\r\nwhich a fighting Pope would find himself embarrassed in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. But the other party discerned these\r\ncomplications from the first, and knew what use to make of them.\r\n\r\nThe powers of reaction had only to catch hold of a perfectly modern\r\nsentiment, the doctrine that ecclesiastics should be men of peace, in\r\norder to dissipate the myth of a Pope liberator. It was beside the\r\nquestion that, from the moment he accepted such a doctrine, the Pope\r\ncondemned the institution of prince-bishoprics, of which he\r\nrepresented the last survival. Nor was it material that, if he adopted\r\nit, consistency should have made him carry it to its logical\r\nconsequence of non-resistance. By aid of this theory of a peaceful\r\nPontiff, with the threat, in reserve, of a schism, Austria felt\r\nconfident that she could avoid the enormous moral inconvenience of a\r\nPope in arms against her.\r\n\r\nEither, however, the full force of the influence which caused Pius IX.\r\nto draw back was not brought to bear till somewhat late in the day, or\r\nthe part acted by him during the months of March and April can be\r\nhardly acquitted of dissimulation. War preparations were continued,\r\nwith the warm co-operation of the Cardinal President of the Council,\r\nand when General Durando started for the frontier with 17,000 men, he\r\nwould have been a bold man who had said openly in Rome that they were\r\nintended not to fight.\r\n\r\nWhile the Pope was still supposed to favour the war, Ferdinand of\r\nNaples did not dare to oppose the enthusiasm of his subjects, and the\r\ndemand that a Neapolitan contingent should be sent to Lombardy. The\r\nfirst relay of troops actually started, but the generals had secret\r\norders to take the longest route, and to lose as much time as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTuscany had a very small army, but such assistance as she could give\r\nwas both promised and given. The fate of the Tuscan corps of 6000 men\r\nwill be related hereafter. The Grand Duke Leopold identified himself\r\nwith the Italian cause with more sincerity than was to be found at\r\nRome or Naples; still, the material aid that he could offer counted as\r\nnext to nothing.\r\n\r\nThere remained Piedmont and Charles Albert. Now was the time for the\r\narmy which he had created (for Charles Felix left no army worthy of\r\nthe name) to assert upon the Lombard fields the reason of its\r\nexistence. War with Austria was declared on the 23rd of March. It was\r\nmidnight; a vast crowd waited in silence in Piazza Castello. At last\r\nthe windows of the palace were opened, a sudden flood of light from\r\nwithin illuminating the scene. Charles Albert stepped upon the balcony\r\nbetween his two sons. He was even paler than usual, but a smile such\r\nas no one had seen before was on his lips. He waved the long\r\nproscribed tricolor slowly over the heads of the people.\r\n\r\nThe King said in his proclamation that 'God had placed Italy in a\r\nposition to provide for herself ('in grado di fare da sè'). Hence the\r\noften repeated phrase: 'L'Italia farà da sè.' He told the Lombard\r\ndelegates, who met him at Pavia that he would not enter their capital,\r\nwhich had shown such signal valour, till after he had won a victory.\r\nHe declared to all that his only aim was to complete the splendid work\r\nof liberation so happily begun; questions of government would be\r\nreserved for the conclusion of the war. Joy was the order of the day,\r\nbut the fatal mistakes of the campaign had already commenced; there\r\nhad been inexcusable delay in declaring war; if it was pardonable to\r\nwait for the Milanese initiative, it was as inexpedient as it seemed\r\nungenerous to wait till the issue of the struggle at Milan was\r\ndecided. Then, after the declaration of war, considering that the\r\nSardinian Government must have seen its imminence for weeks, and\r\nindeed for months, there was more time lost than ought to have been\r\nthe case in getting the troops under weigh. Still, at the opening of\r\nthe campaign, two grand possibilities were left. The first was\r\nobviously to cut Radetsky off in his painful retreat, largely\r\nperformed along country by-roads, as he had to avoid the principal\r\ncities which were already free. Had Charles Albert caught him up while\r\nhe was far from the Quadrilateral, the decisive blow would have been\r\nstruck, and the only man who could save Austria in Italy would have\r\nbeen taken prisoner. Radetsky chose the route of Lodi and the lower\r\nBrescian plains to Montechiaro, where the encampments were ready for\r\nthe Austrian spring manoeuvres: from this point an easy march carried\r\nhim under the walls of Verona. Here he met General d'Aspre, who had\r\njust arrived with the garrison of Padua. D'Aspre, by skill and\r\nresolution, had brought his men from Padua without losing one, having\r\nrefused the Paduans arms for a national guard, though ordered from\r\nMilan to grant them. 'You come to tell me all is lost,' said the\r\nField-Marshal when they met 'No,' rejoined the younger general, 'I\r\ncome to tell you all is saved.'\r\n\r\nThis great chance missed, there was another which could have been\r\nseized. Mantua, extraordinary to relate, was defended by only three\r\nhundred artillerymen and a handful of hussars. It would have fallen\r\ninto the hands of its own citizens but for the presence of mind of its\r\ncommandant, the Polish General Gorzhowsky, who told them that to no\r\none on earth would he deliver the keys of the fortress except to his\r\nEmperor, and that the moment he could no longer defend it he would\r\nblow it into the air, with himself and half Mantua. He showed them the\r\nflint and the steel with which he intended to do the deed. Enemy\r\nthough he was, that incident ought to be recorded in letters of gold\r\non the gates of Mantua, as a perpetual lesson of that most difficult\r\nthing for a country founded in revolution to learn: the meaning of a\r\nsoldier's duty.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see that, if Charles Albert had made an immediate dash\r\non Mantua, the fortress, or its ruins, would have been his, to the\r\nenormous detriment of the Austrian position. But this chance too was\r\nmissed. On the 31st of March, the 9000 men sent with all speed by\r\nRadetsky to the defenceless fortress arrived, and henceforth Mantua\r\nwas safe. Charles Albert only got within fifteen or sixteen miles of\r\nit five days later, to find that all hope of its capture was gone.\r\n\r\nThe campaign began with political as well as with military mistakes.\r\nAt the same time that the King of Sardinia was declaring in the\r\nProclamation addressed to the Lombards that, full of admiration of the\r\nglorious feats performed in their capital, he came to their aid as\r\nbrother to brother, friend to friend, his ambassadors were trying to\r\npersuade the foreign Powers, and especially Austria, Prussia and\r\nRussia, that the only object of the war was to avoid a revolution in\r\nPiedmont, and to prevent the establishment of a republic in Lombardy.\r\nNo one was convinced or placated by these assurances; far better as\r\npolicy than so ignominious an attempt at hedging would have been the\r\nacknowledgment to all the world of the noble crime of patriotism. But,\r\nas Massimo d'Azeglio once observed, Charles Albert had the incurable\r\ndefect of thinking himself cunning. It was, moreover, only too true\r\nthat, although in these diplomatic communications the King allowed the\r\ncase against him to be stated with glaring exaggeration, yet they\r\ncontained an element of fact. He _was_ afraid of revolution at home;\r\nhe _was_ afraid of a Lombard republic; these were not the only, nor\r\nwere they the strongest, motives which drove him into the war, but\r\nthey were motives which, associated with deeper causes, contributed\r\nto the disasters of the future.\r\n\r\nThe Piedmontese force was composed of two _corps d'armée,_ the first\r\nunder General Bava and the second under General Sonnaz: each amounted\r\nto 24,000 men. The reserves, under the Duke of Savoy, numbered 12,000.\r\nRadetsky, at first (after strengthening the garrisons in the\r\nfortresses), could not put into the field more than 40,000 men. As has\r\nbeen stated, the King assumed the supreme command, which led to a\r\nconstant wavering between the original plan of General Bava, a capable\r\nofficer, and the criticisms and suggestions of the staff. The greatest\r\nmistake of all, that of never bringing into the field at once more\r\nthan about half the army, was not without connection with the supposed\r\nnecessity, based on political reasons, of garrisoning places in the\r\nrear which might have been safely left to the care of their national\r\nguards.\r\n\r\nBesides the royal army, there were in the field 17,000 Romans, 3000\r\nModenese and Parmese, and 6000 Tuscans. There were also several\r\ncompanies of Lombard volunteers, Free Corps, as they were called,\r\nwhich might have been increased to almost any extent had they not been\r\ndiscouraged by the King, who was believed to look coldly on all these\r\nextraneous allies, either from doubt of their efficiency, or from the\r\nwish to keep the whole glory of the campaign for his Piedmontese army.\r\n\r\nThe first engagements were on the line of the Mincio. On the 8th of\r\nApril the Sardinians carried the bridge of Goito after a fight of four\r\nhours. The burning of the village of Castelnuovo on the 12th, as a\r\npunishment for its having received Manara's band of volunteers,\r\nexcited great exasperation; many of the unfortunate villagers perished\r\nin the flames, and this and other incidents of the same kind did much\r\ntowards awakening a more vivid hatred of the Austrians among the\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nAfter easily gaining possession of the left (Venetian) bank of the\r\nMincio, Charles Albert employed himself in losing time over chimerical\r\noperations with a view to taking the fortresses of Peschiera and\r\nMantua, now strongly garrisoned, and impregnable while their\r\nprovisions lasted. This object governed the conduct of the campaign,\r\nand caused the waste of precious months during every day of which\r\nGeneral Nugent, with his 30,000 men, was approaching one step nearer\r\nfrom the mountains of Friuli, and General Welden, with his 10,000,\r\ndown the passes of Tyrol. If, instead of playing at sieges, Charles\r\nAlbert had cut off these reinforcements, Radetsky would have been\r\nrendered powerless, and the campaign would have had another\r\ntermination. Never was there a war in which the adoption of Napoleon's\r\nsystem of crushing his opponents one by one, when he could not\r\noutnumber them if united, was more clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Durando crossed the Po on the 21st of April with 17,000 men,\r\npartly Pontifical troops and partly volunteers, to which weak corps\r\nfell the task of opposing Nugent's advance in Venetia. The colours of\r\nthe Pontifical troops were solemnly blessed before they left Rome, but\r\nas the order was only given to go to the frontier, and nothing was\r\nsaid, though everything was understood, about crossing it, the Pope\r\nwas technically able to assert that the war was none of his making.\r\nHis ministry ventured to suggest to him that the situation was\r\npeculiar. Now it was that Catholic Austria and Russia, herself\r\nschismatic, flourished in the face of the Pope the portentous scare of\r\na new schism. It is said that the Pope's confessor, a firm Liberal,\r\ndied just at this time, not without suspicion of poison. Thoroughly\r\nalarmed in his spiritual capacity, the Pope issued his Encyclical\r\nLetter of the 29th of April--when his ministers and the whole country\r\nstill hoped from day to day that he would formally declare war--in\r\nwhich he protested that his sacred office obliged him to embrace all\r\nnations in an equal paternal love. If his subjects, he added, followed\r\nthe example of the other Italians, he could not help it: a\r\nhalf-hearted admission which could not mitigate the indignation which\r\nthe document called forth. With regard to Durando's corps, the Pope\r\ndid what was the best thing under the altered circumstances; he sent\r\nL.C. Farini as envoy to the King of Sardinia, with the request that he\r\nwould take the Roman troops under his supreme command, the Papal\r\nGovernment agreeing to continue the pay of such of them as belonged to\r\nthe regular army. Pius IX. made one last effort to help his\r\nfellow-countrymen which people hardly noticed, so futile did it\r\nappear, but which was probably made in profound seriousness. He wrote\r\na letter to the Emperor of Austria begging him to make all things\r\nright and pleasant by voluntarily withdrawing from his Italian\r\ndominions. Popes had dictated to sovereigns before now; was there not\r\nCanossa? Besides, if a miracle was sought, why should not a miracle\r\nhappen? Pope and Emperor shaking hands over a free Italy and a world\r\nreconciled--how delightful the prospect! Who can doubt that when the\r\nPope wrote that letter all the beautiful dreams of Cardinal Mastai\r\ncarried him once more away (it was the last time) in an ecstasy of\r\nblissful hopes? 'Let not your Majesty take offence,' ran the appeal,\r\n'if we turn to your pity and religion, exhorting you with fatherly\r\naffection to desist from a war which, powerless to re-conquer the\r\nhearts of the Lombards and Venetians, can only lead to a dark series\r\nof calamities. Nor let the generous Germanic nation take offence if\r\nwe invite it to abandon old hatreds, and convert into useful relations\r\nof friendly neighbourhood a dominion which can be neither noble nor\r\nhappy if it depend only on the sword. Thus we trust in the nation\r\nitself, honestly proud of its own nationality, to no longer make a\r\npoint of honour of sanguinary attempts against the Italian nation, but\r\nrather to perceive that its true honour lies in recognising Italy as a\r\nsister.'\r\n\r\nThe Emperor received the bearer of the letter with coldness, and\r\nreferred him to his ministers, who simply called his attention to the\r\nfact that the Pope owed the Temporal Power to the same treaties as\r\nthose which gave Austria the possession of Lombardy and Venetia.\r\n\r\nThe day after the publication of the Encyclical, that is to say, the\r\n30th of April, the Piedmontese obtained their first important success\r\nin the battle of Pastrengo, near Peschiera. Fighting from daybreak to\r\nsundown, they drove the enemy back into Verona, with a loss of 1200\r\nkilled and wounded. The Austrians were in rather inferior numbers; but\r\nthe victory was highly creditable to the hitherto untried army of\r\nPiedmont, and showed that it contained excellent fighting material. It\r\nwas not followed up, and might nearly as well have never been fought.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan troops, of whom 41,000 were promised, 17,000 being on\r\nthe way already, were intended to reinforce Durando's corps in\r\nVenetia. With the two or three battalions which Manin could spare from\r\nthe little army of Venice, the Italian forces opposed to Nugent's\r\nadvance would have been brought up to 60,000 men; in which case not\r\neven Charles Albert's 'masterly inactivity' could have given Austria\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan Parliament convoked under the new Constitution was to\r\nmeet on the 15th of May. A dispute had been going on for several days\r\nbetween the Sovereign and the deputies about the form of the\r\nparliamentary oath, the deputies wishing that the Chambers should be\r\nleft free to amend or alter the Statute, while the King desired that\r\nthey should be bound by oath to maintain it as it was presented to\r\nthem. It was unwise to provoke a disagreement which was sure to\r\nirritate the King. However, late on the 14th, he appeared to yield,\r\nand consented that the wording of the oath should be referred to the\r\ndiscussion of Parliament itself. It seems that, at the same time, he\r\nordered the troops of the garrison to take up certain positions in the\r\ncity. A colonel of the National Guard raised the cry of royal treason,\r\ncalling upon the people to rise, which a portion of them did, and\r\nbarricades were constructed in the Toledo and other of the principal\r\nstreets. A more insane and culpable thing than this attempt at\r\nrevolution was never put in practice. It was worse even than that 20th\r\nof May at Milan, which threw Eugene into the arms of Austria. Its\r\nconsequences were those which everyone could have foreseen--a two\r\ndays' massacre in the streets of Naples, begun by the troops and\r\ncontinued by the lazzaroni, who were allowed to pillage to their\r\nhearts' content; the deputies dispersed with threats of violence,\r\nParliament dissolved before it had sat, the original Statute torn up,\r\nand (by far the most important) the Neapolitan troops, now at Bologna,\r\nrecalled to Naples. This was the pretty work of the few hundred\r\nreckless rioters on the 15th of May.\r\n\r\nHad not Pius IX. by this time repudiated all part in the war, the King\r\nof the Two Sicilies would have thought twice before he recalled his\r\ncontingent, though the counsels of neutrality which he received from\r\nanother quarter--from Lord Palmerston in the name of the English\r\nGovernment--strengthened his hand not a little in carrying out a\r\ndefection which was the direct ruin of the Italian cause. When the\r\norder to return reached Bologna, the veteran patriot, General Pepe,\r\nwho had been summoned from exile to take the chief command, resolved\r\nto disobey, and invited the rest to follow him. Nearly the whole of\r\nthe troops were, however, faithful to their military oath. The\r\nsituation was horrible. The choice lay between the country in danger\r\nand the King, who, false and perjured though he might be, was still\r\nthe head of the State, to whom each soldier had sworn obedience. One\r\ngallant officer escaped from the dilemma by shooting himself. Pepe,\r\nwith a single battalion of the line, a company of engineers, and two\r\nbattalions of volunteers, went to Venice, where they fought like\r\nheroes to the end.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May, Radetsky, taking the offensive with about 40,000\r\nmen, marched towards Mantua, near which was stationed the small Tuscan\r\ncorps, whose commander only received when too late General Bava's\r\norder to retire from an untenable position. On the 29th the Austrians,\r\nin overwhelming numbers, bore down upon the 6000 Tuscans at Montanara\r\nand Curtatone, and defeated them after a resistance of six hours. The\r\nTuscan professor, Giuseppe Montanelli, fell severely wounded while\r\nholding the dead body of his favourite pupil, but he recovered to show\r\nless discretion in politics than he had shown valour in the field.\r\n\r\nPeschiera, where the supplies were exhausted, capitulated on the 30th,\r\nand the day after found 22,000 Piedmontese ready to give Radetsky\r\nbattle at Goito, whence, after a severe contest, they drove him back\r\nto Mantua. The Austrians lost 3000 out of 25,000 men. The honours of\r\nthe day fell to the Savoy brigade, which was worthy of its own fame\r\nand of the future King of Italy, who was slightly wounded while\r\nleading it. Outwardly this seemed the most fortunate period of the war\r\nfor Charles Albert, but that had already happened which was to cause\r\nthe turning of the tide. Nugent, with his 30,000 men, had joined\r\nRadetsky. His march across Venetia was harassed by the inhabitants,\r\nwho left him no peace, especially in the mountain districts, but the\r\npoor little force of Romans and volunteers under Durando and Ferrari\r\nwas unable to seriously check his progress in the open country, though\r\nhe failed in the attempt to take the towns of Treviso and Vicenza in\r\nhis passage. The repulse of the Austrians, 18,000 strong, from Vicenza\r\non the 23rd of May, did great credit to Durando, who only had 10,000\r\nmen, most of them _Crociati_, as the volunteers were called, whose\r\nideas about fighting were original. It is hard to see how this General\r\ncould have done more than he did with the materials at his disposal,\r\nor in what way he merited the abuse which was heaped upon him. The\r\ncase would have been very different if his hybrid force had been\r\nsupported by the Neapolitan army.\r\n\r\nNugent was ordered by Radetsky to let the intermediate places alone,\r\nand to come on to him as fast as circumstances would admit. The\r\njunction of their troops was, the Field-Marshal saw, of vital\r\nnecessity, but when this was achieved, and when Welden had also\r\nbrought his 15,000 fresh men from Tyrol, he turned his attention to\r\nVicenza, since, as long as that town remained in Durando's hands,\r\nVenetia would still be free. He conceived the bold plan of making an\r\nexcursion to Vicenza with his complete army, while Charles Albert\r\nenjoyed the pleasant illusion that the Austrians were in full retreat\r\nowing to his success at Goito. The result of Radetsky's attack was not\r\ndoubtful, but the defence of the town on the 10th of June could not\r\nhave been more gallant; the 3500 Swiss, the Pontifical Carabineers,\r\nand the few other troops belonging to the regular army of the Pope did\r\nwonders. Cialdini, the future general, and Massimo d'Azeglio, the\r\nfuture prime minister, fought in this action, and the latter was\r\nseverely wounded. After several hours' resistance there was nothing to\r\nbe done but to hoist the white flag; Radetsky's object was\r\naccomplished, the Venetian _terra firma_ was practically once more in\r\nthe power of Austria. On the 14th he was back again at Verona without\r\nthe least harm having happened in his absence.\r\n\r\nOnly military genius of the first order could now have saved the\r\nPiedmontese, and what prevailed was the usual infatuation. Charles\r\nAlbert's lines were extended across forty miles of country, from\r\nPeschiera to Goito. On the 23rd of July the Austrians fell upon their\r\nweakest point, and obliged Sonnaz' division to cross over to the right\r\nbank of the Mincio. On the 24th, the King succeeded in dislodging the\r\nAustrians from Custozza after four hours' struggle; but next day,\r\nwhich was spent entirely in fighting, Radetsky retook Custozza, and\r\nobliged the King to fall back on Villafranca. Now began the terrible\r\nretreat on Milan, performed under the ceaseless fire of the pursuers,\r\nwho attacked and defeated the retreating army for the last time, close\r\nto Milan, on the 4th of August. Radetsky had with him 45,000 men;\r\nCharles Albert's forces were reduced to 25,000. He had lost 5000 since\r\nhe recrossed the Mincio. He begged for a truce, and, defeated and\r\nundone, he entered the city which he had vowed should only receive him\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nTo suppose that anything could have been gained by subjecting Milan to\r\nthe horrors of a siege seems at this date the veriest madness;\r\nwhatever Charles Albert's sins were, the capitulation of Milan was not\r\namong them. The members of a wild faction, however, demanded\r\nresistance to the death, or the death of the King if he refused. It is\r\ntheir severest censure to say that their pitiless fury is not excused\r\neven by the tragic fate of a population which, having gained freedom\r\nunaided less than six months before, saw itself given back to its\r\nancestral foe by the man in whom it had hoped as a saviour. They saw\r\ncrimes where there were only blunders, which had brought the King to a\r\npass only one degree less wretched than their own. Crushed,\r\nhumiliated, his army half destroyed, his personal ambition--to rate no\r\nhigher the motive of his actions--trodden in the dust; and now the\r\nname of traitor was hissed in his ears by those for whom he had made\r\nthese sacrifices.\r\n\r\nStung to the heart, the King instructed General Bava to tell the\r\nMilanese that if they were ready to bury themselves under the ruins of\r\nthe city, he and his sons were ready to do the same. But the\r\nMunicipality, convinced of the desperateness of the situation, had\r\nalready entered into negotiations with Radetsky, by which the\r\ncapitulation was ratified. On this becoming known, the Palazzo Greppi,\r\nwhere Charles Albert lodged, was the object of a new display of rage;\r\nan attempt was even made to set it on fire. During the night, the King\r\nsucceeded in leaving the palace on foot, guarded by a company of\r\nBersaglieri and accompanied by his son, the Duke of Genoa, who, on\r\nhearing of his father's critical position, disobeyed the order to stay\r\nwith his regiment, and came into the city to share his danger.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 6th of August, the Austrians reentered Milan. They\r\nthemselves said that the Milanese seemed distraught. The Municipality\r\nwas to blame for having concealed from the people the real state of\r\nthings, by publishing reports of imaginary victories. Had the\r\nunthinking fury of the mob ended, as it so nearly ended, in an\r\nirreparable crime, the authors of these falsehoods would have been,\r\nmore than anyone else, responsible for the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1848 was finished. From the frontier, Charles Albert\r\nissued a proclamation to his people, calling upon the Piedmontese to\r\nrender the common misfortunes less difficult to bear by giving his\r\narmy a brotherly reception. 'In its ranks,' he concluded, 'are my sons\r\nand I, ready, as we all are, for new sacrifices, new hardships, or for\r\ndeath itself for our beloved fatherland.'\r\n\r\nThe political and diplomatic transactions connected with the war in\r\nLombardy were the subject after it closed of much discussion, and of\r\nsome violent recriminations. Even from the short account given in\r\nthese pages, it ought to be apparent that the supreme cause of\r\ndisaster was simply bad generalship. Contemporaries, however, judged\r\notherwise; if they were monarchists, they attributed the failure to\r\nthe want of whole-hearted co-operation of the Provisional Governments\r\nof Lombardy with the liberating King; if they were republicans, they\r\nattributed it to the King's want of trust in the popular element, and\r\nanxiety lest, instead of receiving an increase of territory, he should\r\nfind himself confronted with a new republic at his door. Both parties\r\nwere so far correct that the strain of double purposes, or, at least,\r\nof incompatible aspirations which ran through the conduct of affairs,\r\nmilitated against a fortunate ending. The Piedmontese Government,\r\neven had it wished, would have found it difficult to adhere strictly\r\nto the programme of leaving all political matters for discussion after\r\nthe war. What actually happened was that the union, under the not\r\naltogether attractive form of Fusion with Piedmont (instead of in the\r\nshape of the formation of an Italian kingdom), was effected at the end\r\nof June and beginning of July over the whole of Lombardy and Venetia,\r\nincluding Venice, where, perhaps alone, the feeling against it was not\r\nthat of a party, but of the bulk of the population. Manin shared that\r\nfeeling, but his true patriotism induced him to push on the Fusion in\r\norder to avoid the risk of civil war. He retired into private life the\r\nday it was accomplished, only to become again by acclamation Head of\r\nthe State when the reverses of Sardinia obliged the King's Government\r\nto renounce the whole of his scarcely--acquired possessions, not\r\nexcepting Modena, which had been the first, by a spontaneous\r\nplebiscite, to elect him Sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic history of the war is chiefly the history of the\r\nefforts of the English Cabinet to pull up a runaway horse. Lord Minto\r\nhad been sent to urge the Italian princes to grant those concessions\r\nwhich Austria always said (and she was perfectly right) would lead to\r\na general attack upon her power, but when the attack began, the\r\nBritish Government strained every nerve to limit its extension and\r\ndiminish its force. That Lord Palmerston in his own mind disliked\r\nAustria, and would have been glad to see North Italy free, does not\r\nalter the fact that he played the Austrian game, and played it with\r\nsuccess. He strongly advised every Italian prince to abstain from the\r\nconflict, and it is further as certain as anything can well be, that\r\nhis influence, exercised through Lord Normanby, alone averted French\r\nintervention in August 1848, when the desperate state of things made\r\nthe Italians willing to accept foreign aid. What would have happened\r\nif the French had intervened it is interesting to speculate, but\r\nimpossible to decide. Their help was not desired, except as a last\r\nresource, by any party in Italy, nor by any man of note except Manin.\r\nThe republicans wished Italy to owe her liberation to herself; Charles\r\nAlbert wished her to owe it to him. The King also feared a republican\r\npropaganda, and was uneasy, not without reason, about Savoy and Nice.\r\nLamartine would probably have been satisfied with the former, but it\r\nis doubtful if Charles Albert, though capable of giving up his crown\r\nfor Italy, would have been capable of renouncing the cradle of his\r\nrace. When Lamartine was succeeded by Cavaignac, perhaps Nice would\r\nhave been demanded as well as Savoy. That both the King and Mazzini\r\nwere right in mistrusting the sentiments of the French Government, is\r\namply testified by a letter written by Jules Bastide to the French\r\nrepresentative at Turin, in which the Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nspeaks of the danger to France of the formation of a strong monarchy\r\nat the foot of the Alps, that would tend to assimilate the rest of\r\nItaly, adding the significant words: 'We could admit the unity of\r\nItaly on the principle and in the form of a federation of independent\r\nstates, each balancing the other, but never a unity which placed the\r\nwhole of Italy under the dominion of one of these states.'\r\n\r\nWhether, in spite of all this, a political mistake was not made in not\r\naccepting French aid when it was first offered (in the spring of 1848)\r\nmust remain an open question. When the French came eleven years later,\r\nthey were actuated by no purer motives, but who would say that Cavour,\r\ninstead of seeking, should have refused the French alliance?\r\n\r\nOne other point has still to be noticed: the proposal made by Austria\r\nin the month of May to give up Lombardy unconditionally if she might\r\nkeep Venetia, which was promised a separate administration and a\r\nnational army. Nothing shows the state of mind then prevailing in a\r\nmore distinct light than the scorn with which this offer was\r\neverywhere treated. Lord Palmerston declined to mediate on such a\r\nbasis 'because there was no chance of the proposal being entertained,'\r\nwhich proved correct, as when it was submitted to the Provisional\r\nGovernment of Milan, it was not even thought worth taking into\r\nconsideration. No one would contemplate the sacrifice of Venice by a\r\nnew Campo Formio.\r\n\r\nFar, indeed, was Austria the victorious in August from Austria the\r\nhumiliated in May. On the 9th of August, Hess and Salasco signed the\r\narmistice between the lately contending Powers. The next day the\r\nEmperor Ferdinand returned to his capital, from which he had been\r\nchased in the spring. He might well congratulate himself upon the\r\nmarvellous recovery of his empire; but the revolution in Hungary was\r\nyet to be quelled, and another rising at Vienna in October tried his\r\nnerves, which were never of the strongest. On the 2nd of December he\r\nabdicated in favour of his young nephew, the Archduke Francis Joseph,\r\nwho had been brought face to face more than once on the Mincio with\r\nthe Duke of Savoy, whom he rivalled in personal courage.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of December, another event occurred which placed a new\r\npiece on the European chess-board: Louis Napoleon was elected to the\r\nPresidency of the French Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL OF THRONES\r\n\r\n1848-1849\r\n\r\nGaribaldi Arrives--Venice under Manin--The Dissolution of the Temporal\r\nPower--Republics at Rome and Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the remnant of the Piedmontese army recrossed the bridge over\r\nthe Ticino at Pavia, crushed, though not though want of valour,\r\noutraged in the person of its King, surely the saddest vanquished host\r\nthat ever retraced in sorrow the path it had traced in the wildest\r\njoy, a few thousand volunteers in Lombardy still refused to lay down\r\ntheir arms or to recognise that, after the capitulation of Milan, all\r\nwas lost. Valueless as a fact, their defiance of Austria had value as\r\na prophecy, and its prophetic aspect comes more clearly into view when\r\nit is seen that the leader of the little band was Garibaldi, while its\r\nstandard-bearer was Mazzini. These two had lately met for the first\r\ntime since 1833, when Garibaldi, or 'Borel,' as he was called in the\r\nranks of 'Young Italy,' went to Marseilles to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe head and brain of the society which he had joined, as has been\r\nmentioned, on the banks of the Black Sea.\r\n\r\n'When I was young and had only aspirations,' said Garibaldi in London\r\nin April 1864, 'I sought out a man who could give me counsel and guide\r\nmy youthful years; I sought him as the thirsty man seeks water. This\r\nman I found; he alone kept alive the sacred fire, he alone watched\r\nwhile all the world slept; he has always remained my friend, full of\r\nlove for his country, full of devotion for the cause of freedom: this\r\nman is Joseph Mazzini.'\r\n\r\nThe words spoken then--when the younger patriot was the chosen hero of\r\nthe greatest of free nations, while the elder, still misunderstood by\r\nalmost all, was shunned and calumniated, and even called 'the worst\r\nenemy of Italy'--gave one fresh proof, had one been wanting, that,\r\nthough there have been more flawless characters than Garibaldi, never\r\nin a human breast beat a more generous heart. Politically, there was\r\nnearly as much divergence between Mazzini and Garibaldi as between\r\nMazzini and Cavour; the master thought the pupil lacked ideality, the\r\npupil thought the master lacked practicalness; but they were at one in\r\nthe love of their land and in the desire to serve her.\r\n\r\nOn parting with Mazzini in 1833, Garibaldi, then captain of a sailing\r\nvessel, went to Genoa and enrolled himself as a common sailor in the\r\nRoyal Piedmontese Navy. The step, strange in appearance, was certainly\r\ntaken on Mazzini's advice, and the immediate purpose was doubtless to\r\nmake converts for 'Young Italy' among the marines. Had Garibaldi been\r\ncaught when the ruthless persecution of all connected with 'Young\r\nItaly' set in, he would have been shot offhand, as were all those who\r\nwere found dabbling with politics in the army and navy. He escaped\r\njust in time, and sailed for South America.\r\n\r\nThe _Gazzetta Piemontese_ of the 17th of June 1834 published the\r\nsentence of death passed upon him, with the rider which declared him\r\nexposed to public vengeance 'as an enemy of the State, and liable to\r\nall the penalties of a brigand of the first category.' He saw the\r\npaper; and it was the first time that he or anyone else had seen the\r\nname of Giuseppe Garibaldi in print; a name of which Victor Emmanuel\r\nwould one day say that 'it filled the furthest ends of the earth.'\r\n\r\nProfitable to Italy, over nearly every page of whose recent history\r\nmight be written 'out of evil cometh forth good,' was the banishment\r\nwhich threw Garibaldi into his romantic career of the next twelve\r\nyears between the Amazon and the Plata. Soldier of fortune who did not\r\nseek to enrich himself; soldier of freedom who never aimed at power,\r\nhe always meant to turn to account for his own country the experience\r\ngained in the art of war in that distant land, where he rapidly became\r\nthe centre of a legend, almost the origin of a myth. Antique in\r\nsimplicity, singleness, superabundance of life, and in a sort of\r\nnaturalism which is not of to-day; unselfconscious, trustful in\r\nothers, forgiving, incapable of fear, abounding in compassion,\r\nGaribaldi's true place is not in the aggregation of facts which we\r\ncall history, but in the apotheosis of character which we call the\r\n_Iliad_, the _Mahabharata_, the _Edda_, the cycles of Arthur and of\r\nRoland, and the _Romancero del Cid_.\r\n\r\nIn childhood he rescued a drowning washerwoman; in youth he nursed men\r\ndying of cholera; as a veteran soldier he passed the night among the\r\nrocks of Caprera hunting for a lamb that was lost. No amount of habit\r\ncould remove the repugnance he felt at uttering the word 'fire.' Yet\r\nthis gentle warrior, when his career was closed and he lay chained to\r\nhis bed of pain, endorsed his memoirs with the Spanish motto: 'La\r\nguerra es la verdadera vida del hombre.' War was the veritable life of\r\nGaribaldi; war, not conspiracy; war, not politics; war, not, alas!\r\nmodel farming, for which the old chief fancied in his later years that\r\nhe had discovered in himself a vocation.\r\n\r\nRiding the wild horses and chasing the wild cattle of the Pampas, his\r\neyes covering the immense spaces untrodden by man, this corsair of\r\nfive-and-twenty drank deep of the innocent pleasures of untamed\r\nnature, when not occupied in fighting by land or sea, with equal\r\nfortune; or rather, perhaps, with greater fortune and greater proof of\r\ninborn genius as commander of the naval campaign of the Paran[=a] than\r\nas defender of Monte Video. No adventures were wanting to him; he was\r\neven imprisoned and tortured. In South America he found the one woman\r\nworthy to bear his name, the lion-hearted Anita, whom he carried off,\r\nshe consenting, from her father and the man to whom her father had\r\nbetrothed her. Garibaldi in after years expressed such deep contrition\r\nfor the act which bore Anita away from the quiet life in store for\r\nher, and plunged her into hardships which only ended when she died,\r\nthat, misinterpreting his remorse, many supposed the man from whom he\r\ntook her to have been already her husband. It was not so. Shortly\r\nbefore the Church of San Francisco at Monte Video was burnt down (some\r\ntwenty years ago), the marriage register of Garibaldi and Anita was\r\nfound in its archives, and a legal copy was made. In it she is\r\ndescribed as 'Doña Ana Maria de Jesus, unmarried daughter of Don\r\nBenito Rivevio de Silva, of Laguna, in Brazil.' The bridegroom, who\r\nduring all his American career had scarcely clothes to cover him,\r\nparted with his only possession, an old silver watch, to pay the\r\npriest's fees. Head of the Italian Legion, he only took the rations of\r\na common soldier, and as candles were not included in the rations, he\r\nsat in the dark. Someone reported this to the Government, who sent him\r\na present of £20, half of which he gave to a poor widow.\r\n\r\nWhen the first rumours that something was preparing in Italy reached\r\nMonte Video, Garibaldi wrote a letter offering his services to the\r\nPope, still hailed as Champion of Freedom, and soon embarked himself\r\nfor the Old World, with eighty-five of his best soldiers, among whom\r\nwas his beloved friend, Francesco Anzani. Giacomo Medici had been\r\ndespatched a little in advance to confer with Mazzini. At starting,\r\nthe Legion knew nothing of the revolution in Milan and Venice, or of\r\nCharles Albert having taken the field. Great was their wonder,\r\ntherefore, on reaching Gibraltar, to see hoisted on a Sardinian ship a\r\nperfectly new flag, never beheld by them out of dreams--the Italian\r\ntricolor.\r\n\r\nSo Garibaldi returned at forty-one years of age to the country where\r\nthe sentence of death passed upon him had never been revoked. Before\r\nthe law he was still 'a brigand of the first category.' Nor was he\r\nquite sure that he would not be arrested, and, as a precaution, when\r\nhe cast anchor in the harbour of his native Nice, he ran up the Monte\r\nVidean colours. It was needless. Throngs of people crowded the quays\r\nto welcome home the Ligurian captain, who had done great things over\r\nsea. Anita was there; she had preceded him to Europe with their three\r\nchildren, Teresita, Menotti and Ricciotti. There, also, was his old\r\nmother, who never ceased to be beautiful, the 'Signora Rosa,' as the\r\nNizzards called her. She was almost a woman of the people, but the\r\nsimple dignity of her life made all treat her as a superior being. To\r\nher prayers, while she lived, Garibaldi believed that he owed his\r\nsafety in so many perils, and after her death the soldiers used to say\r\nthat on the eve of battles he walked apart communing with her spirit.\r\n\r\nFrom Nice, Garibaldi went to Genoa, where he took a last leave of his\r\nfriend Anzani, who returned from exile not to fight, as he had hoped,\r\nbut to die. The day before he expired, Medici arrived at Genoa; he was\r\nvery angry with the Chief, in consequence of some disagreement as to\r\nthe place of landing. Anzani said to him entreatingly: 'Do not be\r\nhard, Medici, on Garibaldi; he is a predestined man: a great part of\r\nthe future of Italy is in his hands.' The counsel from dying lips sank\r\ndeep into Medici's heart; he often disagreed with Garibaldi, but to\r\nhis last day he never quarrelled with him again. Long years after, if\r\nfriction arose between Garibaldi and his King, it was Medici's part to\r\nthrow oil on the waters.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi sought an interview with Charles Albert, and offered him his\r\narms and the arms of his Legion, 'not unused to war.' Pope or prince,\r\nlittle it mattered to him who the saviour of Italy should be. But\r\nCharles Albert, though he was polite, merely referred his visitor to\r\nhis ministers, and the inestimable sword of the hero went begging for\r\na month or more, till the Provisional Government of Milan gave him the\r\ncommand of the few thousand volunteers with whom we saw him at the\r\nconclusion of the campaign. The war was over before he had a chance of\r\nstriking a blow. His indignant cry of defiance could not be long\r\nsustained, for Garibaldi never drove men to certain and useless\r\nslaughter; when the real position of things became known to him, he\r\nled his band over the Swiss confines, and bid them wait for a better\r\nand not distant day.\r\n\r\nUnder Manin's wise rule, which was directed solely to the preservation\r\nof peace within the city, and resistance to the enemy at its gates,\r\nVenice remained undaunted by the catastrophes in Lombardy, after all\r\nthe Venetian _terra firma_ had been restored to Austria. (Even the\r\nheroic little mountain fort of Osopo in the Friuli was compelled to\r\ncapitulate on the 12th of October.) The blockade of the city on the\r\nlagunes did not prevent Venice from acting not only on the defensive\r\nbut on the offensive; in the sortie of the 27th of October, 2500\r\nVenetians drove the Austrians from Mestre with severe losses, carrying\r\nback six captured guns, which the people dragged in triumph to the\r\nDoge's palace. A cabin-boy named Zorzi was borne on the shoulders of\r\nthe soldiers enveloped in the Italian flag; his story was this: the\r\nnational colours, floating from the mast of the pinnace on which he\r\nserved, were detached by a ball and dropped into the water; the child\r\nsprang in after them, and with a shout of _Viva l'Italia,_ fixed them\r\nagain at the masthead under a sharp fire. Zorzi was, of course, the\r\nsmall hero of the hour, especially among the women. General Pepe\r\ncommanded the sortie, with Ulloa, Fontana and Cosenz as his\r\nlieutenants; Ugo Bassi, the patriot monk of Bologna, marched at the\r\nhead of a battalion with the crucifix, the only arms he ever carried,\r\nin his hand. The success cost Italy dear, as Alessandro Poerio, poet\r\nand patriot, the brother of Baron Carlo Poerio of Naples, lost his\r\nlife by a wound received at Mestre. But the confidence of Venice in\r\nher little army was increased a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nThe most important event of the autumn of 1848 was the gradual but\r\ncontinuous break-up of the Papal authority in Rome. The meeting of the\r\nnew Parliament only served to accentuate the want of harmony between\r\nthe Pope and his ministers; assassinations were frequent; what law\r\nthere was was administered by the political clubs. In Count Terenzio\r\nMamiani, Pius IX. found a Prime Minister who, for eloquence and\r\npatriotism, could hardly be rivalled, but hampered as he was by the\r\nopposition he encountered from the Sovereign, and by the absence of\r\nany real or solid moderate constitutional party in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies, Mamiani could carry out very few of the improvements he\r\ndesired to effect, and in August he retired from an impracticable\r\ntask, to be replaced by men of less note and talent than himself.\r\n\r\nWishing to create fresh complications for the Pope, the Austrians\r\ninvaded the Legations, regardless of his protests, and after the fall\r\nof Milan, General Welden advanced on Bologna, where, however, his\r\nforces were so furiously attacked by the inhabitants and the few\r\ncarabineers who were all the troops in the town, that they were\r\ndislodged from the strong position they had taken up on the\r\nMontagnola, the hill which forms the public park, and obliged to fly\r\nbeyond the city walls. Radetsky disapproved of Welden's movements on\r\nBologna, and ordered him not to return to the assault.\r\n\r\nHad the Austrians returned and massacred half the population of\r\nBologna, the Pope might have been saved. When Rome heard that the\r\nstormy capital of Romagna was up in arms, once more, for a moment,\r\nthere were united counsels. 'His Holiness,' ran the official\r\nproclamation, 'was firmly resolved to repel the Austrian invasion with\r\nall the means which his State and the well-regulated enthusiasm of his\r\npeople could supply.' The Chamber confirmed the ministerial proposal\r\nto demand French help against Austria. But all this brave show of\r\nenergy vanished with the pressing danger, and Bologna, which, by its\r\nmanly courage, had galvanised the whole bloodless body-politic, now\r\nhastened the hour of dissolution by lapsing into a state of deplorable\r\nanarchy, the populace using the arms with which they had driven out\r\nthe Austrians, to establish a reign of murder and pillage. L.C. Farini\r\nrestored something like order, but the general weakness of the power\r\nof government became every day more apparent.\r\n\r\nThe Pope made a last endeavour to avert the catastrophe by calling to\r\nhis counsels Count Pellegrino Rossi, a man of unyielding will, who was\r\nas much opposed to demagogic as to theocratic government. Rossi,\r\nhaving been compromised when very young in Murat's enterprises, lived\r\nlong abroad, and attained the highest offices under Louis Philippe,\r\nwho sent him to Rome to arrange with the Pope the delicate question of\r\nthe expulsion of the Jesuits from France, which he conducted to an\r\namicable settlement, though one not pleasing to the great Society.\r\nNot being one of those who change masters as they change their boots\r\naccording to the state of the roads, the ambassador retired from the\r\nFrench service when Louis Philippe was dethroned. As minister to the\r\nPope, he made his influence instantly felt; measures were taken to\r\nrestore order in the finances, discipline in the army, public security\r\nin the streets, and method and activity in the Government offices. The\r\ntax on ecclesiastical property was enforced; fomenters of anarchy,\r\neven though they wore the garb of patriots, and perhaps honestly\r\nbelieved themselves to be such, were vigorously dealt with. If anyone\r\ncould have given the Temporal Power a new lease of life, it would have\r\nbeen a man so gifted and so devoted as Pellegrino Rossi, but the\r\nentire forces, both of subversion and of reaction, were against him,\r\nand most of all was against him the fatality of dates. Not at human\r\nbidding do the dead arise and walk. The most deeply to be regretted\r\nevent that happened in the course of the Italian revolution gave his\r\ninevitable failure the appearance of a fortuitous accident.\r\n\r\nParliament, which had been prorogued on the 26th of August, was to\r\nopen on the 15th of November. Anarchy, black and red, was in the air.\r\nThough disorders were expected, Rossi made no provision for keeping\r\nthe space clear round the palace where Parliament met; knots of men,\r\nwith sinister faces, gathered in all parts of the square. Rossi was\r\nwarned in the morning that an attempt would be made to assassinate\r\nhim; he was entreated not to go to the Chamber, to which he replied\r\nthat it was his duty to be present, and that if people wanted his\r\nblood they would have it sooner or later, whether he took precautions\r\nor not. Two policemen to keep the passage free when he reached the\r\nChamber would, nevertheless, have saved his life. As he walked from\r\nhis carriage to the stairs, an unknown individual pushed against him\r\non the right side, and when he turned to see who it was, the assassin\r\nplunged a dagger in his throat. He fell, bathed in blood, to expire\r\nwithout uttering a word.\r\n\r\nIn the Chamber, the deputies proceeded to business; not one raised an\r\nindignant protest against a crime which violated the independence of\r\nthe representatives of the nation. The mere understanding of what\r\nliberty means is absolutely wanting in most populations when they\r\nfirst emerge from servitude.\r\n\r\nAfter the craven conduct of the deputies, it is no wonder if the dregs\r\nof the people went further, and paraded the streets singing songs in\r\npraise of the assassin. The Pope summoned the Presidents of the two\r\nChambers and Marco Minghetti, whom he requested to form a new\r\nministry. But the time for regular proceeding was past; the city was\r\nin the hands of the mob, which imposed on the Pope the acceptance of a\r\nministry of nonentities nominated by it. The Swiss Guard fired on the\r\ncrowd which attempted to gain access to the Quirinal; the crowd,\r\nreinforced by the Civic Guard, returned to the attack and fired\r\nagainst the walls, a stray shot killing Monsignor Palma, who was in\r\none of the rooms. The Pope decided on flight. He left Rome in disguise\r\nduring the evening of the 25th of November. After gaining the\r\nNeapolitan frontier, he took the road to Gaeta. The illusion of the\r\nPope Liberator ended with the Encyclical; the illusion of the\r\nConstitutional Pope ended with the flight to Gaeta. Pius IX. was only\r\nin a limited degree responsible for his want of success, because the\r\ntask he had set before him was the quadrature of the circle in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nThe weight of a less qualified responsibility rests upon him for his\r\nsubsequent actions. On the 3rd of December Parliament voted a proposal\r\nto send a deputation to the Pope, praying him to return to his States.\r\nTo give the deputation greater authority, the Municipality of Rome\r\nproposed that the Syndic, the octogenarian Prince Corsini, should\r\naccompany it. It also comprised two ecclesiastics, and thus\r\nconstituted, it left Rome for Gaeta on the 5th of December. On the\r\nborders of the Neapolitan kingdom its passage was barred by the\r\npolice, and it was obliged to retrace its steps to Terracina. Here the\r\ndeputation drew up a letter to Cardinal Antonelli (no longer the\r\npatriotic minister of the spring), in which an audience with the\r\nSovereign Pontiff was respectfully requested. The answer came that the\r\nPope would not receive the deputation. It was an answer that he was at\r\nliberty to make, but it should have meant abdication. If, called back\r\nby the will of the Parliament of his own making, the Sovereign deigned\r\nnot even to receive the bearers of the invitation, in what way did he\r\ncontemplate resuming the throne? It was only too easy to guess. The\r\nHead of Christendom had become a convert of King Ferdinand of Naples,\r\notherwise Bomba. By a path strewn with the sinister flowers of war did\r\nPius IX. meditate returning to his subjects--by that path and no\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Galetti-Sterbini ministry, appointed by the Pope under popular\r\npressure a few days before his departure, remained in charge of\r\naffairs, somewhat strengthened by the adhesion of Terenzio Mamiani as\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs. Mamiani at first declined to form part of\r\nthe ministry, but joined it afterwards with self-sacrificing\r\npatriotism, in the hope of saving things from going to complete rack\r\nand ruin during the interregnum caused by the withdrawal of the Head\r\nof the State. He only retired from the ungrateful office when he saw\r\nthe imminence of a radical change in the form of government, which was\r\nnot desired by him any more than it had been by Rossi.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the population of the Roman States had desired such a\r\nchange ever since the days of Gregory; the temporary enthusiasm for\r\nPius, if it arrested the flow of the stream, did not prevent the\r\nwaters from accumulating beyond the dyke. One day the dyke would\r\nburst, and the waters sweep all before them.\r\n\r\nA Constituent Assembly was convoked for the 5th of February 1849. The\r\nelections, which took place on the 21st of January, were on this\r\nbasis: every citizen of more than twenty-one years was allowed to\r\nvote; every citizen over twenty-five could become a deputy; the number\r\nof deputies was fixed at two hundred; a candidate who received less\r\nthan 500 votes would not be elected. On the 9th of February, the\r\nConstituent Assembly voted the downfall of the Temporal Power (free\r\nexercise of his spiritual functions being, at the same time, assured\r\nto the Supreme Pontiff), and the establishment of a republican form of\r\ngovernment. The Roman Republic was proclaimed from the Capitol.\r\n\r\nTen votes were given against the republic. No government ever came\r\ninto existence in a more strictly legal manner. Had it not represented\r\nthe true will of the people, the last Roman Commonwealth could not\r\nhave left behind so glorious, albeit brief, a record.\r\n\r\nA youthful poet, descendant of the Doges of Genoa, Goffredo Mameli,\r\nwhose 'Fratelli d'Italia' was the battle-hymn to which Italy marched,\r\nwrote these three words to Mazzini: 'Roma, Repubblica, Venite.' So\r\nMazzini came to Rome, which confided her destinies to him, as she had\r\nonce confided them to the Brescian Arnold and to Cola di Rienzi. Not\r\nArnold--not Rienzi in his nobler days--dreamed a more sublime dream of\r\nRoman liberty than did Giuseppe Mazzini, or more nearly wrote down\r\nthat dream in facts.\r\n\r\nOriginally the executive power was delegated to a committee, but this\r\nwas changed to a Triumvirate, the Triumvirs being Armellini, Saffi and\r\nMazzini. Mazzini's mind and will directed the whole.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February, Cardinal Antonelli demanded in the Pope's\r\nname the armed intervention of France, Austria, Spain and Naples, 'as\r\nin this way alone can order be restored in the States of the Church,\r\nand the Holy Father re-established in the exercise of his supreme\r\nauthority, in compliance with the imperious exigencies of his august\r\nand sacred character, the interests of the universal Church, and the\r\npeace of nations. In this way he will be enabled to retain the\r\npatrimony which he received at his accession, and transmit it in its\r\nintegrity to his successors.'\r\n\r\nThe Pope, who could not bring himself to stain his white robes with\r\nthe blood of the enemies of Italy, called in four armies to shoot down\r\nhis subjects, because in no other way could he recover his lost\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nPius IX. was the twenty-sixth Pontiff who called the foreigner into\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe final conquest of the Pope by the party of universal reaction\r\ncould only be effected by his isolation from all but one set of\r\ninfluences; this is precisely what happened at Gaeta. There are\r\nreasons for thinking that his choice of the hospitality of the King of\r\nthe Two Sicilies, rather than that of France or Spain or Sardinia, was\r\nthe result of an intrigue in which Count Spaur, the Bavarian minister\r\nwho represented the interests of Austria in Rome after that power\r\nwithdrew her ambassador, played a principal part. Even after Pius\r\narrived at Gaeta, it is said that he talked of it as the first stage\r\nof a longer journey. He had never shown any liking for the Neapolitan\r\nBourbons, and the willingness which he expressed to Gioberti to crown\r\nCharles Albert King of Italy if his arms were successful, was probably\r\nduly appreciated by Ferdinand II. To save the Pope from absorption by\r\nthe retrograde party, and to avoid the certainty of a foreign\r\ninvasion, Gioberti, who became Prime Minister of Piedmont in November\r\n1848, was anxious to occupy the Roman states with Sardinian troops\r\nimmediately after the Pope's flight, when his subjects still\r\nrecognised his sovereignty. Gioberti resigned because this policy was\r\nopposed by Rattazzi and other of his colleagues in the ministry. It\r\nwould have been a difficult _rôle_ to play; Sardinia, while\r\nendeavouring to checkmate the reaction, might have become its\r\ninstrument. The failure of Gioberti's plan cannot be regretted, but\r\nhis forecast of what would happen if it were not attempted proved to\r\nbe correct.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of his exalted guest, King Ferdinand with his\r\nfamily, a great number of priests, and a strong escort, moved his\r\nresidence from the capital to Gaeta. The modified Constitution,\r\nsubstituted for the first charter after the events of the 15th of May,\r\nwas still nominally in force; Parliament had met during the summer,\r\nbut the King solved the riddle of governing through his ministers, on\r\npurely retrograde principles, without paying more heed to the\r\nrepresentatives of the nations than to the benches on which they sat.\r\nProrogued on the 5th of September, Parliament was to have met on the\r\n30th of November, but when that date approached, it was prorogued\r\nagain to the 1st of February. 'Our misery has reached such a climax,'\r\nwrote Baron Carlo Poerio, 'that it is enough to drive us mad. Every\r\nfaculty of the soul revolts against the ferocious reactionary\r\nmovement, the more disgraceful from its execrable hypocrisy. We are\r\ngoverned by an oligarchy; the only article maintained is that\r\nrespecting the taxes. The laws have ceased to exist; the Statute is\r\nburied; a licentious soldiery rules over everything, and the press is\r\nconstantly employed to asperse honest men. The lives of the deputies\r\nare menaced. Another night of St Bartholomew is threatened to all who\r\nwill not sell body and soul.' Ferdinand only waited till he had\r\nrecovered substantial hold over Sicily to do away with even the\r\nfiction of parliamentary government. Messina had fallen in September,\r\nthough not till half the city was in flames, the barbarous cruelties\r\npractised on the inhabitants after the surrender exciting the\r\nindignation of the English and French admirals who witnessed the\r\nbombardment. This was the first step to the subjection of Sicily, but\r\nnot till after Syracuse and Catania fell did the King feel that there\r\nwas no further cause for anxiety--the taking of the capital becoming a\r\nmere question of time. He was so much pleased at the fall of Catania\r\nthat he had a mock representation of the siege performed at Gaeta in\r\npresence of the Pope and of half the sacred college.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March Prince Torelli handed the President of the\r\nNeapolitan Chamber of Deputies a sealed packet which contained a royal\r\ndecree dissolving Parliament. Naples was once more under an\r\nirresponsible despotism. The lazzaroni of both the lower and higher\r\nclasses, if by lazzaroni may be understood the born allies of\r\nignorance, idleness and bigotry, rejoiced and were glad. Nor were they\r\nfew. Unlike the Austrians in the north, Ferdinand had his party; the\r\n'fidelity of his subjects' of which he boasted, was not purely\r\nmythical. Whether, considering its basis, it was much to boast of,\r\nneed not be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn March, the happy family at Gaeta was increased by a new arrival.\r\nHad he been better advised, Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, would have\r\nnever gone to breathe that malarious atmosphere. He had played no\r\nconjuror's tricks with his promises to his people; Austrian though he\r\nwas, he had really acted the part of an Italian prince, and there was\r\nnothing to show that he had not acted it sincerely. But a persistent\r\nbad luck attended his efforts. Though the ministers appointed by him\r\nincluded men as distinguished as the Marquis Gino Capponi, Baron\r\nRicasoli and Prince Corsini, they failed in winning a strong popular\r\nsupport. Leghorn, where the population, unlike that of the rest of\r\nTuscany, is by nature turbulent, broke into open revolution. In the\r\nlast crisis, the Grand Duke entrusted the government to the extreme\r\nLiberals, Montanelli the professor, and Guerrazzi the novelist; both\r\nwere honourable men, and Guerrazzi was thought by many to be a man of\r\ngenius. The vigorous rhetoric of his _Assedio di Firenze_ had warmed\r\nthe patriotism of many young hearts. But, as statesmen, the only\r\ntalent they showed was for upsetting any _régime_ with which they were\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke was asked to convoke a Constituent Assembly, following\r\nthe example of Rome. If every part of Italy were to do the same, the\r\nconstitution and form of government of the whole country could be\r\nsettled by a convention of the various assemblies. The idea was worthy\r\nof respect because it pointed to unity; but in view of the existing\r\nsituation, Tuscany's solitary adhesion would hardly have helped the\r\nnation, while it was accompanied by serious risks to the state. The\r\nGrand Duke seemed about to yield to the proposal, but, on receiving a\r\nstrong protest from the Pope, he refused to do so on the ground that\r\nit would expose himself and his subjects to the terrors of\r\necclesiastical censure. He still remained in Tuscany, near Viareggio,\r\ntill he was informed that a band of Leghornese had set out with the\r\nintention of capturing his person. Then he left for Gaeta on board the\r\nEnglish ship _Bull Dog._ The republic had been already proclaimed at\r\nFlorence, with Montanelli and Guerrazzi as its chief administrators.\r\nIt succeeded in pleasing no one. Civil war was more than once at the\r\nthreshhold of Florence, for the peasants rose in armed resistance to\r\nthe new government. In less than two months the restoration of the\r\nGrand. Ducal authority was accomplished almost of itself.\r\nUnfortunately, the Grand Duke who was to come back was not the same\r\nman as he who went away. The air of Gaeta did its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAT BAY\r\n\r\n1849\r\n\r\nNovara--Abdication of Charles Albert--Brescia crushed--French\r\nIntervention--The Fall of Rome--The Fall of Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848, a date might be found when every Italian ruler\r\nexcept the Duke of Modena wore the appearance of a friend to freedom\r\nand independence. In the spring of 1849 no Italian prince preserved\r\nthat appearance except the King of Sardinia. Many causes contributed\r\nto the elimination, but most of all the logic of events. It was a case\r\nof the survival of the fittest. What seemed a calamity was a step in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, the Marquis Pallavicini, prisoner of Spielberg, had a\r\nlong interview with Charles Albert. They sat face to face talking over\r\nItalian matters, and the King said confidently that the army was now\r\nflourishing; if the die were cast anew, they would win. At parting he\r\nembraced the Lombard patriot with the words: 'Dear Pallavicini, how\r\nglad I am to have seen you again! You and I had always the same\r\nthought; the independence of Italy was the first dream of my youth; it\r\nis my dream still, it will be till I die.'\r\n\r\nSome characters grow small in misfortune, others grow great. The\r\nterrible scene at the Palazzo Greppi, the charge of treason, the\r\nshouts of 'death,' had left only one trace on Charles Albert's mind:\r\nthe burning desire to deliver his accusers.\r\n\r\nThe armistice was denounced on the 12th of March, a truce of eight\r\ndays being allowed before the recommencement of hostilities. There is\r\nsuch a thing in politics as necessary madness, and it may be doubted\r\nif the Sardinian war of 1849 was not this thing. The programme of\r\n_fare da sè_ had now to be carried out in stern earnest. Sardinia\r\nstood alone, neither from south of the Apennines nor from north of the\r\nAlps could help be hoped for. France, which was meditating quite\r\nanother sort of intervention, refused the loan even of a general.\r\n'They were not going to offend Austria to please Piedmont,' said the\r\nFrench Cabinet. Worse than this, the army was not in the flourishing\r\nstate of which the King had spoken. The miseries of the retreat, but\r\ninfinitely more, the incidents of Milan, though wiped out by the King\r\nfrom his own memory, were vividly recollected by all ranks. Affection\r\nwas not the feeling with which the Piedmontese soldiers regarded the\r\n'fratelli Lombardi.' Did anyone beside the King believe that this\r\narmy, which had lost faith in its cause, in its leaders and in itself,\r\nwas going to beat Radetsky? The old Field-Marshal might well show the\r\nwildest joy when the denunciation of the armistice was communicated to\r\nhim. And yet the higher expediency demanded that the sacrifice of\r\nPiedmont and of her King for Italy should be consummated.\r\n\r\nRattazzi announced the coming campaign to the Chambers on the 14th of\r\nMarch; the news was well received; there was a general feeling that,\r\nwhatever happened, the present situation could not be prolonged. With\r\nregard to the numbers they could put in the field, Austria and\r\nSardinia were evenly balanced, each having about 80,000 disposable\r\nmen. The request for a French marshal having been refused, the chief\r\ncommand was given to Chrzanowski, a Pole, who did not know Italian,\r\nhad not studied the theatre of the war, and was so little favoured by\r\nnature that, to the impressionable Italians, his appearance seemed\r\nludicrous. This deplorable appointment was made to satisfy the outcry\r\nagainst Piedmontese generalship; as if it was not enough, the other\r\nPolish general, Ramorino, accused of treachery by the revolutionists\r\nin 1832, but now praised to the skies by the democratic party, was\r\nplaced in command of the fifth or Lombard division.\r\n\r\nThough Radetsky openly gave the word 'To Turin!' Chrzanowski seems to\r\nhave failed to realise that the Austrians intended to invade Piedmont.\r\nHe ordered Ramorino, however, with his 8000 Lombards, to occupy the\r\nfork formed by the Po and the Ticino, so as to defend the bridge at\r\nPavia, if, by chance, any fraction of the enemy tried to cross it.\r\nWhat Ramorino did was to place his division on the right bank of the\r\nPo, and to destroy the bridge of boats at Mezzana Corte _between_\r\nhimself and the enemy. The Austrians crossed the Ticino in the night\r\nof the 20th of April, not with a fraction, but with a complete army.\r\nRamorino was deprived of his command, and was afterwards tried by\r\ncourt-martial and shot. Whether his treason was intentional or\r\ninvoluntary, it is certain that, had he stemmed the Austrian advance\r\neven for half a day, the future disasters, if not averted, would not\r\nhave come so rapidly, because the Piedmontese would have been\r\nforewarned. On the evening of the 21st, General D'Aspre, with 15,000\r\nmen, took a portion of the Sardinian army unawares near Mortara, and,\r\nowing to the scattered distribution of the Piedmontese, who would have\r\noutnumbered him had they been concentrated, he succeeded in forcing his\r\nway into Mortara by nightfall. The moral effect of this first reverse\r\nwas bad, but Chrzanowski rashly decided staking the whole fate of the\r\ncampaign in a field-day, for which purpose he gathered what troops he\r\ncould collect at La Biccocca, a hill capped with a village about a\r\nmile and a half from Novara. Not more than 50,000 men were collected;\r\nsome had already deserted, and 20,000 were doing nothing on the other\r\nside of the Po.\r\n\r\nTowards eleven o'clock D'Aspre arrived, and lost no time in beginning\r\nthe attack. He sent post-haste to Radetsky, Appel and Thurn to bring\r\nall the reinforcements in their power as fast as possible. D'Aspre's\r\ndaring was rewarded by his carrying La Biccocca at about mid-day, but\r\nthe Duke of Genoa retook the position with the aid of the valorous\r\n'Piemonte' brigade, and by two p.m. D'Aspre's brave soldiers were so\r\nthoroughly beaten, that nothing could have saved his division from\r\ndestruction, as he afterwards admitted, had Chrzanowski joined in the\r\npursuit instead of staying behind with more than half the army, in\r\naccordance with a preconceived plan of remaining on the defensive.\r\n\r\nAt two o'clock on the 23rd of March, the news started on the wings of\r\nthe wind, and, as great news will do, swiftly reached every part of\r\nthe waiting country, that the Sardinians were getting the best of it,\r\nthat the cause was saved. Men who are not very old remember this as\r\nthe first strong sensation of their lives--this, and its sequel.\r\n\r\nAppel and Thurn, and Wratislaw and the old Field-Marshal were on the\r\nmarch, and by four o'clock they were pouring their fresh troops upon\r\nthe Piedmontese, who had not known how to profit by their success.\r\nHeroism such as few battlefields have seen, disorder such as has\r\nrarely disgraced a beaten army, were displayed side by side in Charles\r\nAlbert's ranks. At eight in the evening, the whole Sardinian army\r\nretired into Novara; the Austrians bivouacked on La Biccocca. The\r\nSardinians had lost 4000 in dead and wounded; the losses of the\r\nvictors were a thousand less.\r\n\r\nAll the day long the King courted death, pressing forward where the\r\nballs fell like hail and the confusion was at its height, with the\r\nanswer of despair to the devoted officers who sought to hold him\r\nback: 'Let me die, this is my last day.' But death shuns the seeker.\r\nMen fell close beside him, but no charitable ball struck his breast.\r\nIn the evening he said to his generals: 'We have still 40,000 men,\r\ncannot we fall back on Alessandria and still make an honourable\r\nstand?' They told him that it could not be done. Radetsky was asked on\r\nwhat terms he would grant an armistice; he replied: 'The occupation of\r\na large district in Piedmont, and the heir to the throne as a\r\nhostage.' Then Charles Albert knew what he must do. 'For eighteen\r\nyears,' he said, 'I have made every effort for the good of the people;\r\nI grieve to see that my hopes have failed, not so much for myself as\r\nfor the country. I have not found death on the field of battle as I\r\nardently desired; perhaps my person is the only obstacle to obtaining\r\njuster terms. I abdicate the crown in favour of my son, Victor\r\nEmmanuel.' And turning to the Duke of Savoy he said: 'There is your\r\nKing.'\r\n\r\nIn the night he left Novara alone for Nice. As he passed through the\r\nAustrian lines, the sentinels were nearly firing upon his carriage;\r\nGeneral Thurn, before whom he was brought, asked for some proof that\r\nhe was in fact the 'Count de Barge' in whose name his passport was\r\nmade out. A Bersagliere prisoner who recognised the King, at a sign\r\nfrom him gave the required testimony, and he was allowed to pass. At\r\nNice he was received by the governor, a son of Santorre di Santa Rosa,\r\nand to him he addressed the last words spoken by him on Italian\r\nground: 'In whatever time, in whatever place, a regular government\r\nraises the flag of war with Austria, the Austrians will find me among\r\ntheir enemies as a simple soldier.' Then he continued his journey to\r\nOporto.\r\n\r\nThe principal side-issue of the campaign of 1849 was the revolution at\r\nBrescia. Had the original plan been carried out, which was to throw\r\nthe Sardinian army into Lombardy (and it is doubtful whether, even\r\nafter Radetsky's invasion of Piedmont, it would not have been better\r\nto adhere to it), a corresponding movement on the part of the\r\ninhabitants would have become of the greatest importance. To Brescia,\r\nwhich was the one Lombard town where the Piedmontese had been received\r\nin 1848 with real effusion, the Sardinian Minister of War despatched\r\nCount Giuseppe Martinengo Cesaresco with arms and ammunition, and\r\norders to reassume the colonelcy of the National Guard which he held\r\nin the previous year, and to take the general control of the movement\r\nas far as Brescia was concerned. Martinengo succeeded in transporting\r\nthe arms through the enemy's country from the Piedmontese frontier to\r\nIseo, and thence to his native city. When he reached Brescia, he found\r\nthat the Austrians had evacuated the town, though they still occupied\r\nthe castle which frowns down upon it. This was the 23rd of March:\r\nNovara was fought and lost, Piedmont was powerless to come to the\r\nassistance of the people she had commanded to rise. What was to be\r\ndone? Plainly common sense suggested an honourable compromise with the\r\nAustrian commandant, by which he should be allowed to reoccupy the\r\ncity on condition that no hair of the citizens' heads was touched.\r\nThis is what Bergamo and the other towns did, nor are they to be\r\nblamed.\r\n\r\nNot so Brescia. Here, where love of liberty was an hereditary instinct\r\nfrom the long connection of Brescia with free Venice, where hatred of\r\nthe stranger, planted by the ruthless soldiery of Gaston de Foix, had\r\nbut gone on maturing through three centuries, where the historical\r\ntitle of 'Valiant,' coming down from a remote antiquity, was still no\r\nfable; here, with a single mind, the inhabitants resolved upon as\r\ndesperate a resistance as was ever offered by one little town to a\r\ngreat army.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian bombardment was begun by the Irish General,\r\nNugent-Lavall, who, dying in the midst of it, left all his fortune to\r\nthe heroic city which he was attacking. The Austrians, flushed with\r\ntheir victory over Charles Albert's army of 80,000, were seized with\r\nrage at the sight of their power defied by a town of less than half\r\nthat number of souls. But with that rage was mingled, even in the mind\r\nof Haynau, an admiration not to be repressed.\r\n\r\nHaynau who was sent to replace Nugent, was already known at Brescia,\r\nwhere he had been appointed military governor after the resumption of\r\nAustrian authority in 1848. In order to punish the 'persistent\r\nopposition manifested to the legitimate Imperial and Royal\r\nGovernment,' and as an example to the other towns, he had imposed on\r\nthe Brescian householders and the landed proprietors of the province a\r\nfine of half a million francs.\r\n\r\nHe now returned, and what he did may be best read in his own report on\r\nthe operations. 'It was then,' he wrote, 'that began the most murderous\r\nfight; a fight prolonged by the insurgents from barricade to barricade,\r\nfrom house to house, with extraordinary obstinacy. I should never have\r\nbelieved that so bad a cause could have been sustained with such\r\nperseverance. In spite of this desperate defence, and although the\r\nassault could only be effected in part, and with the help of cannons of\r\nheavy calibre, our brave troops with heroic courage, but at the cost of\r\ngreat losses, occupied a first line of houses; but as all my columns\r\ncould not penetrate into the town at the same time, I ordered the\r\nsuspension of the attack at nightfall, limiting myself to holding the\r\nground conquered. In spite of that, the combat continued late into the\r\nnight. On the 1st of April, in the earliest morning light, the tocsin\r\nwas heard ringing with more fury than ever, and the insurgents reopened\r\nfire with an entirely new desperation. Considering the gravity of our\r\nlosses, as well as the obstinacy and fury of the enemy, it was\r\nnecessary to adopt a most rigorous measure. I ordered that no prisoners\r\nshould be taken, but that every person seized with arms in his hand\r\nshould be immediately put to death, and that the houses from which shots\r\ncame should be burnt. It is thus that conflagrations, partly caused by\r\nthe troops, partly by the bombardment, broke out in various parts of the\r\ntown.'\r\n\r\nDuring the ten days' struggle, the citizens did not flinch for a\r\nmoment. Count Martinengo was the guiding spirit of the defence, and\r\nscarcely left the most exposed of the barricades night or day. From\r\nthe nobles to the poorest of the people, all did their duty. A youth\r\nnamed Tito Speri led and animated the populace. The horrors of the\r\nrepression make one think of the fall of Khartoum. Not even in\r\nHungary, where he went from Brescia to continue his 'system,' did\r\nHaynau so blacken his own and his country's name as here. In a boys'\r\nschool kept by a certain Guidi, the master's wife, his mother and ten\r\nof his pupils were slaughtered. A little hunchback tailor was carried\r\nto the barracks to be slowly burnt alive. But stray details do not\r\ngive the faintest idea of the whole. And for all this, Haynau was in a\r\nfar higher degree responsible than the actual executants of the\r\nvengeance to which he hounded on his ignorant soldiers, maddened with\r\nthe lust of blood.\r\n\r\nSuch was General Haynau, 'whose brave devotion to his master's service\r\nwas the veteran's sole crime,' said the _Quarterly Review_ (June\r\n1853), but who was judged otherwise by some in England. Wherefore was\r\nhe soundly beaten by the brewers in the employment of Messrs Barclay &\r\nPerkins; and the nice words of the _Quarterly_ could not undo that\r\nbeating, redress for which Lord Palmerston blandly advised the\r\ncomplainant to seek 'before the common tribunals.' He thought it best\r\nto neglect the advice, and to leave the country.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious taxes levied at Brescia during the six months after\r\nits fall was one of £500 for 'the expenses of the hangman.' Count\r\nMartinengo escaped after the Austrians were in possession of the town\r\nthrough the courageous assistance given to him by a few young men of\r\nthe working class. Camozzi's band of Bergamasques, which started for\r\nthe relief of the sister city, was driven back with loss.\r\n\r\nThe end was come, but woe to the victors.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Italian flag to where it still floated, we pass from\r\nBrescia in the dust to Rome still inviolate, though soon to be\r\nassailed by the bearers of another tricolor. A few days after Novara,\r\nthe Triumvirate issued a proclamation, in which they said: 'The\r\nRepublic in Rome has to prove to Italy and to Europe that our work is\r\neminently religious, a work of education and of morality; that the\r\naccusations of intolerance, anarchy and violent upturning of things\r\nare false; that, thanks to the republican principle, united as one\r\nfamily of good men under the eye of God, and following the impulse of\r\nthose who are first among us in genius and virtue, we march to the\r\nattainment of true order, law and power united.' Englishmen who were\r\nin Rome at the time attest how well the pledge was kept. Peace and\r\ntrue freedom prevailed under the republican banner as no man\r\nremembered them to have prevailed before in Rome. The bitter\r\nprovocation of the quadruple attack was not followed by revengeful\r\nacts on the parts of the government against those who were politically\r\nand religiously associated with him at whose bidding that attack was\r\nmade. Nothing like a national party was terrorised or kept under by\r\nfear of violence. 'That at such a time,' writes Henry Lushington, who\r\nwas not favourable to Mazzini, 'not one lawless or evil deed was done\r\nwould have been rather a miracle than a merit, but on much concurrent\r\ntestimony it is clear that the efforts of the government to preserve\r\norder were incessant, and to a remarkable degree successful.' He adds\r\nthat the streets were far safer for ordinary passengers under the\r\nTriumvirs than under the Papacy.\r\n\r\nOf great help in quieting the passions of the lower orders was the\r\npeople's tribune, Ciceruacchio, who had not put on black cloth\r\nclothes, or asked for the ministry of war, or of fine arts, according\r\nto the usual wont of successful tribunes. Ciceruacchio had the sense\r\nof humour of the genuine Roman _popolano_, and it never came into his\r\nhead to make himself ridiculous. His influence had been first acquired\r\nby works of charity in the Tiber floods. Being a strong swimmer, he\r\nventured where no one else would go, and had saved many lives. At\r\nfirst a wine-carrier, he made money by letting out conveyances and\r\ndealing in forage, but he gave away most of what he made. He opposed\r\nthe whole force of his popularity to a war of classes. 'Viva chi c'ia\r\ne chi non c'ia quattrini!'[4] was his favourite cry. Once when a young\r\npoet read him a sonnet in his honour he stopped him at the line 'Thou\r\nart greater than all patricians,' saying that he would not have that\r\npublished: 'I respect the nobility, and never dream of being higher\r\nthan they. I am a poor man of the people, and such I will always\r\nremain.'\r\n\r\nWhen the siege came, Ciceruacchio was invaluable in providing the\r\ntroops with forage, horses, and even victuals, which he procured by\r\nmaking private sorties on his own account during the night; his\r\nintimate knowledge of every path enabling him to go unobserved. He\r\nplanned the earthworks, at which he laboured with his hands, and when\r\nfighting was going on, he shouldered a musket and ran with his two\r\nsons, one of them a mere child, to wherever the noise of guns directed\r\nhim. No picture of Rome in 1849 would be complete without the burly\r\nfigure and jocund face of Angelo Brunetti.\r\n\r\nThe republican government found Rome with a mere shadow of an army;\r\nthe efforts to create one had been too spasmodic to do anything but\r\nmake confusion worse confounded by changes and experiments soon\r\nabandoned. Perseverance and intelligence now had a different result,\r\nand the little army, called into existence by the republic, proved\r\nadmirable in discipline, various and fantastic as were its components.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April, Garibaldi, who had been stationed at Rieti,\r\nwas ordered to bring his legion to Rome. Those who witnessed the\r\narrival saw one of the strangest scenes ever beheld in the Eternal\r\nCity. The men wore pointed hats with black, waving plumes; thin and\r\ngaunt, their faces dark as copper, with naked legs, long beards and\r\nwild dark hair hanging down their backs, they looked like a company of\r\nSalvator Rosa's brigands. Beautiful as a statue amidst his\r\nextraordinary host rode the Chief, mounted on a white horse, which he\r\nsat like a centaur. 'He was quite a show, everyone stopping to look at\r\nhim,' adds the sculptor Gibson, to whom these details are owed.\r\n'Probably,' writes another Englishman, 'a human face so like a lion,\r\nand still retaining the humanity nearest the image of its Maker, was\r\nnever seen.' Garibaldi wore the historic red shirt, and a small cap\r\nornamented with gold.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the red shirt might have remained in poetic uncertainty\r\nhad it not been mentioned a few years ago in a volume of reminiscences\r\npublished by an English naval officer. The men employed in the\r\nSaladéros or great slaughtering and salting establishments for cattle\r\nin the Argentine provinces wore scarlet woollen shirts; owing to the\r\nblockade of Buenos Ayres, a merchant at Monte Video had a quantity of\r\nthese on his hands, and as economy was a great object to the\r\ngovernment, they bought the lot cheap for their Italian legion, little\r\nthinking that they were making the 'Camicia Rossa' immortal in song\r\nand story.\r\n\r\nThe coming to Rome of the 1200 legionaries aroused private fears in\r\nthe hearts of the more timid inhabitants, but Garibaldi knew how to\r\nkeep his wild followers in hand, and gallant was the service they\r\nrendered to Roman liberty.\r\n\r\nThat liberty was now on the eve of its peril. The preliminaries of the\r\nFrench intervention in Rome are tolerably well known; here it suffices\r\nto say that every new contribution to a more precise knowledge of the\r\nfacts only serves to confirm the charge of dissimulation, or, to use a\r\nplainer and far better adapted word, of dishonesty, brought against\r\nthe French government for their part in the matter. White, indeed, do\r\nAustria, Spain and Naples appear--the avowed upholders of priestly\r\ndespotism--beside the ruler of republican France and his ministers,\r\nwhose plan it was not to fight the Roman republic: fighting was far\r\nfrom their counsels, but to betray it. It is proved that the\r\nrestoration of the Temporal Power was the aim of the expedition from\r\nthe first; it is equally proved that the French sought to get inside\r\nRome by distinct disclaimers of any such intention. 'We do not go to\r\nItaly,' they said, 'to impose with our arms a system of government,\r\nbut to assure the rights of liberty, and to preserve a legitimate\r\ninterference in the affairs of the peninsula.' They adopted a curious\r\nmethod of assuring the rights of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe Pope would not have anything to do with the affair. 'If you say\r\nopenly that you are going to give me back my Temporal Power, well and\r\ngood; if not, I prefer the aid of Austria.' So he replied to the\r\nflattering tales whispered in his ear, while tales no less flattering\r\nwere being whispered in the ear of Mazzini. He declined to give the\r\nFrench any guarantees as to his future mode of governing; it cannot be\r\nsaid, therefore, that they were under the delusion that they were\r\nrestoring a constitutional sovereign.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made to cast the responsibility of the Roman\r\nintervention entirely on Louis Napoleon. Even Mazzini favoured that\r\nview, but it is impossible to separate the President of the Republic\r\nfrom the 325 deputies who voted the supplies for the expedition on the\r\n2nd of April. Does anyone pretend that they were hoodwinked any more\r\nthan Ledru Rollin was hoodwinked, or the minority, which, roused by\r\nhis vigorous speech, voted against the grant? Louis Napoleon was far\r\nless Papal in his sentiments than were most of the assenting deputies;\r\nhis own opinion was more truly represented by the letter which, as a\r\nprivate citizen, he wrote to the 'Constitutionnel' in December 1848\r\nthan by his subsequent course as President. In this letter he declared\r\nthat a military demonstration would be perilous even to the interests\r\nwhich it was intended to safeguard. He had but one fixed purpose: to\r\nplease France, so as to get himself made Emperor. France must be held\r\nanswerable for the means taken to please her.\r\n\r\nGeneral Oudinot landed at Civitavecchia on the 25th of April, his\r\nfriendly assurances having persuaded the local authorities to oppose\r\nno resistance, an unfortunate error, but the last. The correct\r\njudgment formed by the Roman Government of the designs of the invaders\r\nwas considerably assisted by a French officer, Colonel Leblanc, who\r\nwas sent to Rome by Oudinot to come to an agreement with Mazzini for\r\nthe amicable reception of the French, and who, losing his temper,\r\nrevealed more than he was meant to reveal. His last words, 'Les\r\nItaliens ne se battent pas,' unquestionably expressed the belief of\r\nthe whole French force, from the general-in-chief to the youngest\r\ndrummer. They were soon going to have a chance of testing its\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Assembly passed a vote that 'force should be repelled by\r\nforce.' Well-warned, therefore, but with the proverbial _coeur léger_,\r\nOudinot advanced on Rome with 8000 men early on the 30th of April. At\r\neleven o'clock the two columns came in sight of St Peter's, and soon\r\nafter, the first which moved towards Porta Angelica was attacked by\r\nColonel Masi. Garibaldi attacked the second column a mile out of Porta\r\nSan Pancrazio. At the first moment the superior numbers of the French\r\ntold, and the Italians fell back on Villa Pamphilli, but Colonel\r\nGaletti arrived with reinforcements, and before long Garibaldi drove\r\nthe French from the Pamphilli Gardens and had them in full retreat\r\nalong the Civitavecchia road. Oudinot was beaten, Rome was victorious.\r\n'This does not surprise us Romans; but it will astonish Paris!' ran a\r\nmanifesto of the hour; the words are a little childish, but men are\r\napt to be childish when they are deeply moved. And as to the\r\nastonishment of Paris, all the words in the world would fail to paint\r\nits proportions. Paris was indeed astonished.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi had not the chief command of the Roman army, or he would\r\nhave done more; there was nothing to prevent the Italians from driving\r\nOudinot into the sea. The Triumvirate, when appealed to directly by\r\nGaribaldi, refused their sanction, either fearing to leave the capital\r\nexposed to the Neapolitans who were advancing, or (and this seems to\r\nhave been the real reason) still hoping that France would repudiate\r\nOudinot and come to terms. Garibaldi was right on this occasion, and\r\nMazzini was wrong. When you are at war, nothing is so ruinous as to be\r\nafraid of damaging the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe French ministers, bombarded with reproaches by friends and foes,\r\nand most uneasy lest their troops in Italy should be destroyed before\r\nthey could send reinforcements, did disown Oudinot's march on Rome,\r\nand Ferdinand de Lesseps was despatched nominally 'to arrange matters\r\nin a pacific sense,' but actually to gain time.\r\n\r\nIn a sitting in the French Assembly, a member of the opposition said\r\nto the President of the Council: 'You are going to reinstate the\r\nPope!' 'No, no,' ejaculated Odilon Barrot. 'You are going to do the\r\nsame as Austria,' cried Lamoricière. 'We should be culpable if we\r\ndid,' was the answer. Lesseps' instructions, very vague, for the rest,\r\nwere given to him in this spirit. That Lesseps acted in good faith has\r\nbeen generally admitted, and was always believed by Mazzini. It was to\r\nthe interest of the French Government to choose a tool who did not\r\nsee how far he was a tool. But if Lesseps had no suspicions, if he had\r\nnot strong suspicions of the real object of his employers, then he was\r\nalready at this date a man singularly easy to deceive.\r\n\r\nThe French envoy was commissioned to treat, not with the Triumvirate,\r\nbut with the Roman Assembly: a piece of insolence which the former\r\nwould have done well to reply to by sending him about his business.\r\nLesseps, however, thought that he would gain by speaking in person to\r\nMazzini, and in order that the interview should remain a secret, he\r\ndecided to go to him alone in the dead of the night and unannounced.\r\nHaving made the needful inquiries, he proceeded to the palace of the\r\nConsulta, the doors of which seem to have been left open all night;\r\nthere were guards, but they were asleep, and the French diplomatist\r\ntraversed the long suite of splendid apartments, opening one into the\r\nother without corridors. At last he reached the simply-furnished room\r\nwhere, upon an iron bedstead, Mazzini slept. Lesseps watched him\r\nsleeping, fascinated by the beauty of his magnificent head as it lay\r\nin repose. He still looked very young, though there was hardly a state\r\nin Europe where he was not proscribed. When Lesseps had gazed his\r\nfull, he called 'Mazzini, Mazzini!' The Triumvir awoke, sat up and\r\nasked if he had come to assassinate him? Lesseps told him his name,\r\nand a long conversation followed. One thing, at least, that Lesseps\r\nsaid in this interview was strictly true, namely, that Mazzini must\r\nnot count on the French republican soldiers objecting to fire on\r\nrepublicans: 'The French soldier would burn down the cottage of his\r\nmother if ordered by his superiors to do so.' The discipline of a\r\ngreat army is proof against politics.\r\n\r\nLesseps was himself in much fear of being assassinated. He believed\r\nthat his footsteps were dogged by three individuals, one of whom was\r\nan ex-French convict. He complained to Mazzini, who said that he could\r\ndo nothing, which probably shows that he gave no credence to the\r\nstory. Then Lesseps had recourse to Ciceruacchio, 'a man of the people\r\nwho had great influence on the population, and who had organised the\r\nrevolution.' The tribune seems to have quieted his fears and\r\nguaranteed his safety.\r\n\r\nThe French envoy could not help being struck by the tender care taken\r\nof his wounded fellow-countrymen by the Princess Belgiojoso and other\r\nnoble ladies who attended the hospitals. Of prisoners who were not\r\nwounded there were none, as they had been sent back scot-free to their\r\ngeneral a few days after the 30th of April. He was struck also by the\r\nfirm resolve of all classes not to restore the Pope. Some liked the\r\nexisting government, some did not, but all prayed heaven to be\r\nhenceforth delivered from the rule of an infallible sovereign.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the measure of confidence which Mazzini felt in Lesseps,\r\nhe was firm as iron on the main point--the non-admittance of the\r\n'friendly' French troops into Rome. Lesseps dragged on the\r\nnegotiations till his government had finished the preparations for\r\nsending to Rome a force which should not be much less than twice in\r\nnumber the whole military resources of the republic. Then they\r\nrecalled him, and, in order not to be bound by anything that he might\r\nhave said, they set about the rumour that he was mad. Indignant at\r\nsuch treatment, Lesseps left the diplomatic service, and turned his\r\nattention to engineering. This was the origin of the Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nWhile all these things were going on, the Austrians moved from Ferrara\r\nand Modena towards Bologna, the Spaniards landed at Fiumicino, and\r\n16,000 Neapolitans, commanded by Ferdinand II., encamped near Albano.\r\nGaribaldi was attacked on the 9th of May by the Neapolitan vanguard,\r\nwhich he obliged to fall back. On the 18th, he completely defeated\r\nKing Ferdinand's army near Velletri, and the King ordered a general\r\nretreat into his own dominions, which was accomplished in haste and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nBy the end of May, Oudinot's forces were increased to over 35,000 men.\r\nThe defenders of Rome, under the chief command of General Rosselli,\r\nwere about 20,000, of whom half were volunteers. Colonel Marnara's\r\nLombard Legion of Bersaglieri was, in smartness of appearance and\r\nperfect discipline, equal to any regular troops; in its ranks were the\r\nsons of the best and richest Lombard families, such as Dandolo,\r\nMorosini and many others. Medici's legion was also composed of\r\neducated and well-to-do young men. The Bolognese, under the Marquis\r\nMelara, had the impetuous daring of their race, and Count Angelo\r\nMasina did wonders with his forty lancers. Wherever Garibaldi was--it\r\nwas always in the hottest places--there were to be seen, at no great\r\ndistance, the patriot monk, Ugo Bassi, riding upon a fiery horse, and\r\nthe young poet of Free Italy, Goffredo Mameli, with his slight, boyish\r\nfigure, and his fair hair floating in the breeze. Nor must we omit\r\nfrom the list of Garibaldi's bodyguard Forbes, the Englishman, and\r\nAnghiar, the devoted negro, who followed his master like a dog.\r\n\r\nOudinot formally disavowed all Lesseps' proceedings from first to\r\nlast, and announced, on the 1st of June, that he had orders to take\r\nRome as soon as possible. Out of regard, however, for the French\r\nresidents, he would not begin the attack 'till the morning of Monday\r\nthe 4th.' Now, though no one knew it but the French general, that\r\nMonday morning began with Sunday's dawn, when the French attacked\r\nMelara's sleeping battalion at the Roman outposts. It was easy for the\r\nFrench to drive back these 300 men, and to occupy the Villa Corsini\r\n('Villa,' in the Roman sense, means a garden) and the position\r\ndominating Porta San Pancrazio; but Galetti came up and retook them\r\nall, to lose them again by nine o'clock. Then Garibaldi, who was ill,\r\nhurried to the scene from his sick-bed, and thrice that day he retook\r\nand thrice he lost the contested positions--a brief statement, which\r\nrepresents prodigies of valour, and the oblation of as noble blood as\r\never watered the earth of Rome. Melara, Masina, Daverio, Dandolo,\r\nMameli: every schoolboy would know these names if they belonged to\r\nancient, not to modern, history. Bright careers, full of promise, cut\r\nshort; lives renounced, not only voluntarily, but with joy, and to\r\nwhat end? Not for interest or fame--not even in the hope of winning;\r\nbut that, erect and crowned with the roses of martyrdom, Rome might\r\nsend her dying salutation to the world.\r\n\r\nAt sunset the French had established their possession of all the\r\npoints outside the Gate of San Pancrazio, except the Vascello, a villa\r\nwhich had been seized from their very teeth by Medici, who held it\r\nagainst all comers. Monte Mario was also in their hands.\r\n\r\nMazzini, whose judgment was obscured by his attribution of the Italian\r\npolicy of France to Louis Napoleon alone, hoped for a revolution in\r\nParis, but Ledru Rollin's attempt at agitation completely failed, and\r\nthe country applauded its government now that the mask was thrown\r\naway. The reasons for revolutions in Paris have always been the same;\r\nthey have to do with something else than the garrotting of\r\nsister-republics.\r\n\r\nOudinot tightened his cordon; on the 12th of June he invited the city\r\nto capitulate. The answer was a refusal; so, with the aid of his\r\nexcellent artillery, he crept on, his passage contested at each step,\r\nbut not arrested, till, on the 27th, the Villa Savorelli, Garibaldi's\r\nheadquarters, fell into the hands of the enemy, and, on the night of\r\nthe 29th, the French were within the city walls. St Peter's day is the\r\ngreat feast of Rome, and this time, as usual, the cupola of St Peter's\r\nwas illuminated, the Italian flag flying from the highest point. The\r\nthunderstorm, which proverbially accompanies the feast, raged during\r\nthe night; the French shells flew in all directions; the fight raged\r\nfiercer than the storm; Medici held out among the crumbling walls of\r\nthe Vascello, which had been bombarded for a week; the heroic Manara\r\nfell fighting at Villa Spada; Garibaldi, descending into the _mêlée_,\r\ndealt blows right and left: he seemed possessed by some supernatural\r\npower. Those around him say that it is impossible that he would have\r\nmuch longer escaped death, but suddenly a message came summoning him\r\nto the Assembly--it saved his life. When he appeared at the door of\r\nthe Chamber, the deputies rose and burst into wild applause. He seemed\r\npuzzled, but, looking down upon himself, he read the explanation; he\r\nwas covered with blood, his clothes were honeycombed by balls and\r\nbayonet thrusts, his sabre was so bent with striking that it would not\r\ngo more than half into its sheath.\r\n\r\nWhat the Assembly wanted to know was whether the defence could be\r\nprolonged; Garibaldi had only to say that it could not. They voted,\r\ntherefore, the following decree: 'In the name of God and of the\r\nPeople: the Roman Constituent Assembly discontinues a defence which\r\nhas become impossible, and remains at its post.' At its post it\r\nremained till the French soldiers invaded the Capitol, where it sat,\r\nwhen, yielding to brute force, the deputies dispersed.\r\n\r\nMazzini, who would have resisted still, when all resistance was\r\nimpossible, wandered openly about the city like a man in a dream. He\r\nfelt as though he were looking on at the funeral of his best-beloved.\r\nHow it was that he was not killed or arrested is a mystery. At the end\r\nof a week his friends induced him to leave Rome with an English\r\npassport.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of July, before the French made their official entry,\r\nGaribaldi called his soldiers together in the square of the Vatican,\r\nand told them that he was going to seek some field where the foreigner\r\ncould still be fought. Who would might follow him; 'I cannot offer you\r\nhonours or pay; I offer you hunger, thirst, forced marches, battles,\r\ndeath.'\r\n\r\nThree thousand followed him. Beside her husband rode Anita; not even\r\nfor the sake of the child soon to come would she stay behind in\r\nsafety. Ugo Bassi was there; Anghiar was dead, Mameli was dying in a\r\nhospital, but there was 'the partisan or brigand Forbes,' as he was\r\ndescribed in a letter of the Austrian general D'Aspre to the French\r\ngeneral Oudinot, with a good handful of Garibaldi's best surviving\r\nofficers. Ciceruacchio came with his two sons, and offered himself as\r\nguide. No one knew what the plan was, or if there was one. Like\r\nknights of old in search of adventures, they set out in search of\r\ntheir country's foes. It was the last desperate venture of men who did\r\nnot know how to yield.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering hither and thither, and suffering severe hardships,\r\nthe column reached the republic of San Marino. The brave hospitality\r\nof that Rock of freedom prevented Garibaldi from falling into the\r\nclutches of the Austrians, who surrounded the republic. He treated\r\nwith the Regent for the immunity of his followers, who had laid down\r\ntheir arms; and, in the night, he himself escaped with Anita, Ugo\r\nBassi, Forbes, Ciceruacchio and a few others. They hoped to take their\r\nswords to Venice, but a storm arose, and the boats on which they\r\nembarked were driven out of their course. Some of them were stranded\r\non the shore which bounds the pine-forest of Ravenna, and here, hope\r\nbeing indeed gone, the Chief separated from his companions. Of these,\r\nUgo Bassi, and an officer named Livraghi, were soon captured by the\r\nAustrians, who conveyed them to Bologna, where they were shot.\r\nCiceruacchio and his sons were taken in another place, and shot as\r\nsoon as taken. The boat which contained Colonel Forbes was caught at\r\nsea by an Austrian cruiser: he was kept in Austrian prisons for two\r\nmonths, and was constantly reminded that he would be either shot or\r\nhung; but the English Government succeeded in getting him liberated,\r\nand he lived to take part in more fortunate fights under Garibaldi's\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Anita was dying in a peasant's cottage, to which Garibaldi\r\ncarried her when the strong will and dauntless heart could no longer\r\nstand in place of the strength that was finished. This was the 4th of\r\nAugust. Scarcely had she breathed her last breath when Garibaldi,\r\nbroken down with grief as he was, had to fly from the spot. The\r\nAustrians were hunting for him in all directions. All the Roman\r\nfugitives were proclaimed outlaws, and the population was forbidden to\r\ngive them even bread or water. Nevertheless--aided in secret by\r\npeasants, priests and all whose help he was obliged to seek--Garibaldi\r\nmade good his flight from the Adriatic to the Mediterranean, the whole\r\nroute being overrun by Austrians. When once the western coast was\r\nreached, he was able, partly by sea and partly by land, to reach the\r\nPiedmontese territory, where his life was safe. Not even there,\r\nhowever, could he rest; he was told, politely but firmly, that his\r\npresence was embarrassing, and for the second time he left\r\nEurope--first for Tunis and then for the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile the French besieged Rome, the Austrians had not been idle. They\r\ntook Bologna in May, after eight days' resistance; and in June, after\r\ntwenty days' attack by sea and land, Ancona fell into their hands. In\r\nthese towns they pursued means of 'pacification' resembling those\r\nemployed at Brescia. All who possessed what by a fiction could be\r\ncalled arms were summarily slaughtered. At Ancona, a woman of bad\r\ncharacter hid a rusty nail in the bed of her husband, whom she wished\r\nto get rid of; she then denounced him to the military tribunal, and\r\ntwo hours later an English family, whose house was near the barracks,\r\nheard the ring of the volley of musketry which despatched him. Austria\r\nhad also occupied the Grand Duchy of Tuscany; and when, in July,\r\nLeopold II. returned to his state, which had restored him by general\r\nconsent and without any foreign intervention, he entered Florence\r\nbetween two files of Austrian soldiery, in violation of the article of\r\nthe Statute to which he had sworn, which stipulated that no foreign\r\noccupation should be invited or tolerated. The Grand Duke wrote to the\r\nEmperor of Austria, from Gaeta, humbly begging the loan of his arms.\r\nFrancis Joseph replied with supreme contempt, that it would have been\r\na better thing if Leopold had never forgotten to whose family he\r\nbelonged, but he granted the prayer. Such was the way in which the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg-Lorraine, that had done much in Tuscany to win\r\nrespect if not love, destroyed all its rights to the goodwill of the\r\nTuscan people, and removed what might have been a serious obstacle to\r\nItalian unity.\r\n\r\nAustria, unable alone to cope with Hungary, committed the immeasurable\r\nblunder of calling in the 200,000 Russians who made conquest certain,\r\nbut the price of whose aid she may still have to pay. Venice, and\r\nVenice only, continued to defy her power. Since Novara, the first\r\nresult of which was the withdrawal of the Sardinian Commissioners, who\r\nhad taken over the government after the Fusion, Venice had been ruled\r\nby Manin on the terms which he himself proposed: 'Are you ready,' he\r\nasked the Venetian Assembly, 'to invest the Government with unlimited\r\npowers in order to direct the defence and maintain order?' He warned\r\nthem that he should be obliged to impose upon them enormous\r\nsacrifices, but they replied by voting the order of the day: 'Venice\r\nresists the Austrians at all costs; to this end the President Manin is\r\ninvested with plenary powers.' All the deputies then raised their\r\nright hand, and swore to defend the city to the last extremity. They\r\nkept their word.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say which was the most admirable: Manin's fidelity to\r\nhis trust, or the people's fidelity to him. To keep up the spirits, to\r\nmaintain the decorum of a besieged city even for a few weeks or a few\r\nmonths, is a task not without difficulty; but when the months run into\r\na second year, when the real pinch of privations has been felt by\r\neveryone, not as a sudden twinge, but as a long-drawn-out pain, when\r\nthe bare necessities of life fail, and a horrible disease, cholera,\r\nenters as auxiliary under the enemy's black-and-yellow,\r\ndeath-and-pestilence flag; then, indeed, the task becomes one which\r\nonly a born leader of men could perform.\r\n\r\nThe financial administration of the republic was a model of order and\r\neconomy. Generous voluntary assistance was afforded by all classes,\r\nfrom the wealthy patrician and the Jewish merchant to the poorest\r\ngondolier. Mazzini once said bitterly that it was easier to get his\r\ncountrymen to give their blood than their money; here they gave both.\r\nThe capable manner in which Manin conducted the foreign policy of the\r\nrepublic is also a point that deserves mention, as it won the esteem\r\neven of statesmen of the old school, though it was powerless to obtain\r\ntheir help.\r\n\r\nThe time was gone when France was disposed to do anything for Venice;\r\nno one except the Archbishop of Paris, who was afterwards to die by\r\nthe hand of an assassin, said a word for her.\r\n\r\nIn the past year, Lord Palmerston, though he tried to localise the\r\nwar, and to prevent the co-operation of the south, abounded in good\r\nadvice to Austria. He repeated till he was tired of repeating, that\r\nshe would do well to retire from her Italian possessions of her own\r\naccord. If the French did not come now, he said, they would come some\r\nday, and then her friends and allies would give her scanty support. As\r\nfor Lombardy, it was notorious that a considerable Austrian party was\r\nin favour of giving it up, including the Archduke Ranieri, who was\r\nstrongly attached to Italy, which was the land of his birth. As for\r\nVenice, Austria had against her both the principle of nationality, now\r\nthe rallying cry of Germany, and the principle of ancient prescription\r\nwhich could be energetically invoked against her by a state to which\r\nher title went back no farther than the transfer effected by\r\nBuonaparte in the treaty of Campo Formio. These were his arguments;\r\nbut he was convinced, by this time, that arguments unsupported by big\r\nbattalions might as well be bestowed on the winds as on the Cabinet of\r\nVienna. From the moment that Radetsky recovered Lombardy for his\r\nmaster, the Italian policy of the Austrian Government was entirely\r\ninspired by him, and he was determined that while he lived, what\r\nAustria had got she should keep. It was thus that, in reply to Manin's\r\nappeal to Lord Palmerston, he only received the cold comfort of the\r\nrecommendation that Venice should come to terms with her enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian army of 20,000 men was reduced by casualties and sickness\r\nto 18,000 or less. It always did its duty. The defence of Fort\r\nMalghera, the great fort which commanded the road to Padua and the\r\nbridge of the Venice railway, would have done credit to the most\r\nexperienced troops in the world. The garrison numbered 2500; the\r\nbesiegers, under Haynau, 30,000. Radetsky, with three archdukes, came\r\nto see the siege, but, tired with waiting, they went away before it\r\nwas ended. The bombardment began on the 4th of May; in the three days\r\nand nights ending with the 25th over 60,000 projectiles fell on the\r\nfort. During the night of the 25th the Commandant, Ulloa, by order of\r\nGovernment, quietly evacuated the place, and withdrew his troops; only\r\nthe next morning the Austrians found out that Malghera was abandoned,\r\nand proceeded to take possession of the heap of ruins, which was all\r\nthat remained.\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of July, an incessant bombardment was directed\r\nagainst the city itself. Women and children lived in the cellars; fever\r\nstalked through the place, but the war feeling was as strong as\r\never--nay, stronger. Moreover, the provisions became daily scarcer, the\r\nday came when hunger was already acutely felt, when the time might be\r\nreckoned by hours before the famished defenders must let drop their\r\nweapons, and Venice, her works of art and her population, must fall a\r\nprey to the savage vengeance of the Austrians, who would enter by force\r\nand without conditions.\r\n\r\nAnd this is what Manin prevented. The cry was still for resistance;\r\nfor the first time bitter words were spoken against the man who had\r\nserved his country so well. But he, who had never sacrificed one iota\r\nto popularity, did not swerve. His great influence prevailed. The\r\ncapitulation was arranged on the 22nd, and signed on the 24th of July.\r\nManin had calculated correctly; on that day there was literally\r\nnothing left to eat in Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the last sad hours that Manin spent in Venice all the love of his\r\npeople, clouded for an instant, burst forth anew. Not, indeed, in\r\nshouts and acclamations, but in tears and sobs; 'Our poor father, how\r\nmuch he has suffered!' they were heard saying. He embarked on a French\r\nvessel bound for Marseilles, poor, worn out and exiled for ever from\r\nthe city which he had guided for eighteen months; if, indeed, no spark\r\nof his spirit animated the dust which it was the first care of\r\nliberated Venice to welcome home. The Austrians broke up his doorstep\r\non which, according to a Venetian custom, his name was engraved.\r\nAnother martyr, Ugo Bassi, had kissed the stone, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n'Next to God and Italy--before the Pope--Manin!' The people gathered\r\nup the broken fragments and kept them as relics, even as in their\r\nhearts they kept his memory, till the arrival of that day of\r\nredemption which, in the darkest hour, he foretold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n'J'ATTENDS MON ASTRE'\r\n\r\n1849-1850\r\n\r\nThe House of Savoy--A King who keeps his Word--Sufferings of the\r\nLombards--Charles Albert's Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumstances more gloomy than those under which Victor Emmanuel II.\r\nascended the throne of his ancestors it would be hard to imagine.\r\n\r\nAn army twice beaten, a bankrupt exchequer, a triumphant invader\r\nwaiting to dictate terms; this was but the beginning of the inventory\r\nof the royal inheritance. The internal condition of the kingdom, even\r\napart from the financial ruin which had succeeded to the handsome\r\nsurplus of two years before, was full of embarrassments of the gravest\r\nkind. There was a party representing the darkest-dyed clericalism and\r\nreaction whose machinations had not been absent in the disaster of\r\nNovara. Who was it that disseminated among the troops engaged in the\r\nbattle broadsides printed with the words: 'Soldiers, for whom do you\r\nthink you are fighting? The King is betrayed; at Turin they have\r\nproclaimed the republic'? There were other broadsides in which Austria\r\nwas called the supporter of thrones and altars. The dreadful\r\nindiscipline witnessed towards the end of, and after the conflict was\r\ndue more to the demoralising doctrines that had been introduced into\r\nthe army than to the insubordination of panic. There was another party\r\nstrengthened by the recent misfortunes and recruited by exiles from\r\nall parts of Italy, which was democratic to the verge of republicanism\r\nin Piedmont and over that verge at Genoa, where a revolution broke out\r\nbefore the new King's reign was a week old. Constitutional government\r\nstood between the fires of these two parties, both fanned by Austrian\r\nbellows, the first openly, the second in secret.\r\n\r\nVictor Emmanuel was not popular. The indifference to danger which he\r\nhad shown conspicuously during the war would have awakened enthusiasm\r\nin most countries, but in Piedmont it was so thoroughly taken for\r\ngranted that the Princes of the House of Savoy did not know fear, that\r\nit was looked on as an ordinary fact. The Austrian origin of the\r\nDuchess of Savoy formed a peg on which to hang unfriendly theories. It\r\nis impossible not to compassionate the poor young wife who now found\r\nherself Queen of a people which hated her race, after having lived\r\nsince her marriage the most dreary of lives at the dismallest court in\r\nEurope. At first, as a bride, she seemed to have a desire to break\r\nthrough the frozen etiquette which surrounded her; it is told how she\r\nonce begged and prayed her husband to take her for a walk under the\r\nPorticoes of Turin, which she had looked at only from the outside. The\r\nyoung couple enjoyed their airing, but when it reached Charles\r\nAlbert's ears, he ordered his son to be immediately placed under\r\nmilitary arrest. The chilling formalism which invaded even the private\r\nlife of these royal personages, shutting the door to 'good\r\ncomradeship' even between husband and wife, may have had much to do\r\nwith driving Victor Emmanuel from the side of the Princess, whom,\r\nnevertheless, he loved and venerated, to unworthy pleasures, the habit\r\nof indulgence in which is far easier to contract than to cure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VICTOR IMMANUEL]\r\n\r\nThe King's address at this time was not conciliatory, and, indeed, it\r\nnever lost a bluntness which later harmonised well enough with the\r\nreputation he gained for soldierly integrity, but which then passed\r\nfor aristocratic haughtiness. His personal friends were said to belong\r\nto the aristocratic or even the reactionary party. In the perplexities\r\nwhich encompassed him, he could not reckon on the encouragement of any\r\nconsensus of good opinion or confidence. He was simply an unknown man,\r\nagainst whom there was a good deal of prejudice.\r\n\r\nRadetsky did not refuse to treat with Charles Albert, as has been\r\nsometimes said, but the intolerably onerous terms first proposed by\r\nhim showed that he wished to force the abdication which Charles Albert\r\nhad always contemplated in the event of new reverses of fortune.\r\nRadetsky was favourably disposed to the young Duke of Savoy, as far as\r\nhis personal feeling was concerned, a fact which was made out in\r\ncertain quarters to be almost a crime to be marked to the account of\r\nVictor Emmanuel. The Field-Marshal did not forget that he was the\r\nson-in-law of the Austrian Archduke Ranieri; it is probable, if not\r\nproved, that he expected to find him pliable; but Radetsky, besides\r\nbeing a politician of the purest blood-and-iron type, was an old\r\nsoldier with not a bad heart, and some of his sympathy is to be\r\nascribed to a veteran's natural admiration for a daring young officer.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of March, Victor Emmanuel, with the manliness that was\r\nborn with him, decided to go and treat himself for the conditions of\r\nthe armistice. It was the first act of his reign, and it was an act of\r\nabnegation; but of how much less humiliation than that performed by\r\nhis father twenty-eight years before, when almost on the same day, by\r\norder of King Charles Felix, the Prince of Carignano betook himself to\r\nthe Austrian camp at Novara, to be greeted with the derisive shout of:\r\n'Behold the King of Italy!' Little did Radetsky think that the words,\r\naddressed then in scorn to the father, might to-day have been\r\naddressed in truthful anticipation to the son.\r\n\r\nThe Field-Marshal took good care, however, that nothing but respect\r\nshould be paid to his visitor, whom he received half-way, surrounded\r\nby his superb staff, all mounted on fine horses and clad in splendid\r\naccoutrements. As soon as the King saw him coming, he sprang from his\r\nsaddle, and Radetsky would have done the same had not he required,\r\nowing to his great age, the aid of two officers to help him to the\r\nground. After he had laboriously dismounted, he made a military\r\nsalute, and then embraced Victor Emmanuel with the greatest\r\ncordiality. The King was accompanied by very few officers, but the\r\npresence of one of these was significant, namely, of the Lombard Count\r\nVimercati, whom he particularly pointed out to Radetsky.\r\n\r\nWhile observing the most courteous forms, the Field-Marshal was not\r\nlong in coming to the point. The negotiations would be greatly\r\nfacilitated, nay, more, instead of beginning his reign with a large\r\nslice of territory occupied by a foreign enemy for an indefinite\r\nperiod, the King might open it with an actual enlargement of his\r\nfrontier, if he would only give the easy assurance of ruling on the\r\ngood old system, and of re-hoisting the blue banner of Piedmont\r\ninstead of the revolutionary tricolor. The moment was opportune;\r\nVictor Emmanuel had not yet sworn to maintain the Constitution. But he\r\nreplied, without hesitation, that though he was ready, if needs be, to\r\naccept the full penalties of defeat, he was determined to observe the\r\nengagements entered into by his father towards the people over whom he\r\nwas called to reign.\r\n\r\nOne person had already received from his lips the same declaration,\r\nwith another of wider meaning. During the previous night, speaking to\r\nthe Lombard officer above mentioned, the King said: 'I shall preserve\r\nintact the institutions given by my father; I shall uphold the\r\ntricolor flag, symbol of Italian nationality, which is vanquished\r\nto-day, but which one day will triumph. This triumph will be,\r\nhenceforth, the aim of all my efforts.' In 1874, on the twenty-fifth\r\nanniversary of Novara, Count Vimercati wrote to the King of Italy from\r\nParis to remind him of the words he had then spoken.\r\n\r\nWhen the King started for his capital, Radetsky offered to draw up his\r\ntroops as a guard of honour over the whole extent of occupied\r\nterritory between Novara and Turin. The offer was declined, and Victor\r\nEmmanuel took a circuitous route to avoid observation. His journey was\r\nmarked throughout by a complete absence of state. Before he arrived, a\r\ntrusty hand consigned to him a note written in haste and in much\r\nanguish by the Queen, in which she warned him to enter by night, as he\r\nwas likely to have a very bad reception. On the 27th of March he\r\nreviewed the National Guard in the Piazza Castello on the occasion of\r\nits taking the oath of allegiance. The ceremony was attended by Queen\r\nMaria Adelaide in a carriage with her two little boys, the Princes\r\nUmberto and Amedeo. There was no hostile demonstration, but there was\r\na most general and icy coldness.\r\n\r\nThat evening, the terms of the armistice were communicated to the\r\nChamber. As was natural, they evoked the wildest indignation, a part\r\nof which fell undeservedly on the King. Twenty thousand Austrians were\r\nto occupy the district between the Po, Sesia and Ticino and half the\r\ncitadel of Alessandria. The excitement rose to its height when it was\r\nannounced that the Sardinian Fleet must be recalled from Venetian\r\nwaters, depriving that struggling city of the last visible sign of\r\nsupport from without. The Chamber sent a deputation to the King, who\r\nsucceeded in persuading its members that, hard though the terms were,\r\nthere was no avoiding their acceptance, and that the original\r\nstipulations were harder still.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th, Victor Emmanuel took the oath to observe the Statute, to\r\nexercise the royal authority only in virtue of the laws, to cause\r\njustice to be fairly and fearlessly administered, and to conduct\r\nhimself in all things with the sole view to the interest, honour and\r\nprosperity of the nation.\r\n\r\nA trifling accident occurred which might have been far from trifling;\r\none of the ornaments of the ceiling of the Palazzo Madama, where the\r\nParliament assembled, fell close to the King. As it was of great\r\nweight, it would have killed anyone on whom it had fallen. 'Never mind\r\nthat,' said the King in Piedmontese dialect to Colonel Menabrea, who\r\nwas near him, 'it will not be the last!'\r\n\r\nThe ministry which held office under the late King resigned; a new\r\none was formed, in which General Delaunay was President of the\r\nCouncil, and Gioberti minister without a portfolio. The King was\r\nadvised to dissolve the Chamber, which had been elected as a war\r\nparliament, and was ill-constituted to perform the work now required.\r\nGeneral La Marmora had orders to quell the insurrection at Genoa, the\r\nmotive of which was not nominally a change of government, but the\r\ncontinuance of the war at all costs. Its deeper cause lay in the old\r\nirreconcilability of republican Genoa with her Piedmontese masters,\r\nbreaking out now afresh under the strain of patriotic disappointment.\r\nLike the 15th of May at Naples, the Genoese revolution was a folly\r\nwhich can hardly be otherwise described than as a crime; it happened,\r\nhowever, that in Piedmont there was a King who had not the slightest\r\nintention of turning it into an excuse for a royal hark-back. Austria\r\nand France offered Victor Emmanuel their arms to put down the\r\nrevolution, but, declining the not exactly disinterested attention, he\r\nmade a wise choice in La Marmora, who accomplished the ungrateful\r\ntask with expedition and humanity. An amnesty was granted to all but a\r\nvery few participators in the revolt. On the brief black list when it\r\nwas submitted to the King was the name of the Marquis Lorenzo Pareto,\r\nwho at one time had held the Foreign Office under Charles Albert. As\r\nColonel of the Genoese National Guard, his responsibility in joining\r\nthe insurrection was judged to be particularly heavy; but the King\r\nrefused to confirm his exclusion from the amnesty. 'I would not have\r\nit said,' he objected, 'that I was harsh to one of my father's old\r\nministers.'\r\n\r\nThe conception of Victor Emmanuel as a bluff, easy-going monarch is\r\nmistaken. Very few princes have had a keener sense of the royal\r\ndignity, or a more deeply-rooted family pride, or, when he thought fit\r\nto resort to it, a more decisive method of preventing people from\r\ntaking liberties with him. But he knew that, in nearly all cases,\r\npardon is the best of a king's prerogatives.\r\n\r\nAn instance to the point happened when he came to the throne. Two\r\nofficers of the royal household had caused him annoyance while he was\r\nDuke of Savoy by telling tales of his unconventionality to his\r\neasily-scandalised father. To them, perhaps, he owed the condign\r\npunishment he had undergone for the famous promenade under the\r\nPorticoes. At anyrate, they had procured for the Duke many bad\r\nquarters-of-an-hour, but the King, when he became King, chose to be\r\ncompletely oblivious of their conduct, and they remained undisturbed\r\nat their posts. To those who pointed to King Leopold of the Belgians,\r\nor to any other foreign example of a loyal sovereign who understood\r\nthe needs of his people as a model for Victor Emmanuel to imitate, he\r\nwas in the habit of replying: 'I remember the history of my fathers,\r\nand it is enough.'\r\n\r\n'The Persians,' says the Greek historian, 'taught their children to\r\nride and to speak the truth.' In a land that had seen as much of\r\nenthroned effeminacy and mendacity as Italy had seen, a prince fond of\r\nmanly exercise and observant of his word was more valuable than a\r\nheaven-sent genius, and more welcome than a calendar saint. Piedmont\r\nonly could give such a prince to Italy. Its kings were not Spaniards\r\nwho, by way of improvement, became lazzaroni, nor were they Austrians\r\ncondemned by a fatal law to revert to their original type; they were\r\nchildren of the ice and snow, the fellow-countrymen of their subjects.\r\nAll their traditions told of obstinacy and hardihood. They brought\r\ntheir useful if scarcely amiable moral qualities from Maurienne in the\r\neleventh century. The second Count of Savoy, known as Amadeus with the\r\nTail, son of Humbert of the White Hands, founder of the House, went to\r\nthe Holy Roman Emperor with such a body of retainers that the guards\r\nrefused them entrance to the Council Chamber. 'Either I shall go in\r\nwith my Tail or not at all,' said Humbert, and with his Tail he went\r\nin. This was the metal of the race. Even at the time when they were\r\nvassals of the Empire, they expected to dictate rather than to obey.\r\nThey studiously married into all the great royal houses of Europe.\r\nThough they persecuted their Vaudois subjects, who were only in 1848\r\nrewarded by emancipation for centuries of unmerited sufferings and\r\nsplendid fidelity, yet the Princes of Savoy had from the first, from\r\nthe White-Handed Humbert himself, held their heads high in all\r\ntransactions with the Holy See, between which and them there was an\r\never-returning antagonism. Not to the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when the rebound from revolutionary chaos did not suffice to\r\ndenationalise the Kings of Sardinia, but sufficed to ally them with\r\nreaction, ought we to turn if we would seize the true bearings of the\r\ndevelopment of the Counts of Maurienne into Kings of Italy. At that\r\nmoment the mission of Piedmont, though not lost, was obscured. What\r\nhas rather to be contemplated is the historic tendency, viewed as a\r\nwhole, of both reigning house and people. No one has pointed out that\r\ntendency more clearly than the anonymous author of a pamphlet entitled\r\n_Le Testament politique du Chevalier Walpole_ (published at Amsterdam\r\nin 1769), who was able to draw the horoscope of the House of Savoy\r\nwith a correctness which seems almost startling. He was not helped by\r\neither sympathy or poetic imagination, but simply by political logic.\r\nSardinia, he said, was the best governed state in Europe. Instead of\r\nyielding to the indolent apathy in which other reigning families were\r\nsunk, its princes sought to improve its laws and develop its resources\r\naccording to the wants of the population and the exigences of the\r\nclimate. Finance, police, the administration of justice, military\r\ndiscipline, presented the picture of order. From the nature of the\r\nsituation, a King of Sardinia must be ambitious, and to satisfy his\r\nambition he had only to bide his time. Placed between two great Powers\r\nhe could choose for his ally whichever would give him the most, and by\r\nplaying this mute _rôle_, it was impossible that he would not\r\nhereafter be called upon to play one of the most important parts in\r\nEurope. Italy was the oyster disputed by Austria and France; might it\r\nnot happen that the King of Sardinia, becoming judge and party, would\r\ndevour the oyster and leave the shells to the rival aspirants? It was\r\nunlikely, added this far-seeing observer, that the Italian populations\r\nshould have got so innured to their chains as to prefer the harsh,\r\nvexatious government of Austria to the happy lot which Sardinian\r\ndomination would secure to them, but even if they had become\r\ndemoralised to this extent, they could not resist the providential\r\nadvance of a temperate, robust and warlike nation like Piedmont, led\r\nby a prince as enlightened as the King (Charles Emmanuel) who then\r\nreigned over it.\r\n\r\nThe metaphor of the oyster recalls another, that of Italy being an\r\nartichoke which the House of Savoy was to devour, a leaf at a time.\r\nWhether or not a Duke of Savoy really invented this often-quoted\r\ncomparison, it is certain that power was what the rulers of Piedmont\r\ncared for. They were no more a race of scholars and art patrons than\r\ntheir people was a people of artists and poets. There is a story to\r\nthe effect that one Duke of Savoy could never make out what poetry\r\nwas, except that it was written in half lines, which caused a great\r\nwaste of paper. The only poet born in Piedmont found the country\r\nunlivable. Recent research among the archives at Turin revealed facts\r\nwhich were thought to be not creditable to certain princely persons,\r\nand a gleaning was therefore made of documents to which the historical\r\nstudent will no longer have access. The step was ill advised; what can\r\ndocuments tell us on the subject that we do not know? Did anyone\r\nsuppose that the Savoy princes were commonly saints? Sainthood has\r\nbeen the privilege of the women of the family, and they have kept it\r\nmostly to themselves. But peccable and rough though the members of\r\nthis royal house may have been, very few of them were without the\r\ngoverning faculty. 'C'est bien le souverain le plus fin que j'ai connu\r\nen Europe,' said Thiers of Victor Emmanuel, whose acquaintance he made\r\nin 1870, and in whom he found an able politician instead of the common\r\nsoldier he had expected. The remark might be extended back to all the\r\nrace. They understood the business of kings. A word not unlike the 'Tu\r\nregere imperio populos, Romane, memento' of Virgil was breathed over\r\nthe cradle at Maurienne. If it did not send forth sons to rule the\r\nworld, its children were, at least, to be enthroned in the capital of\r\nthe Cæsars, and to make Italy one for the first time since Augustus.\r\n\r\nFrom April to August 1849, the peace negotiations dragged on. The\r\npretensions of Austria were still exorbitant, and she resisted the\r\ndemand which Piedmont, weak and reduced though she was, did not fear\r\nto make, that she should amnesty her Italian subjects who had taken\r\npart in the revolution. Unequal to cope with the difficulties of the\r\nsituation, the Delaunay ministry fell, and Massimo d'Azeglio was\r\nappointed President of the Council. This was a good augury for\r\nPiedmont; D'Azeglio's patriotism had received a seal in the wound\r\nwhich he carried away from the defence of Vicenza. Honour was safe in\r\nhis hands, whatever were the sacrifices to which he might be obliged\r\nto consent.\r\n\r\nSome pressure having been put on Austria by France and England, she\r\nagreed in July to evacuate Alessandria, and to reduce the war\r\nindemnity from 230,000,000 francs to 75,000,000, which Piedmont\r\nundertook to pay, onerous though the charge was in her deplorable\r\nfinancial condition. But the amnesty question was the last to be\r\nsettled, and in this Piedmont stood alone. France and her. The\r\nPiedmontese special envoy at Milan, Count Pralormo, wrote to Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg on the 2nd of July that his Government could not give up\r\nthis point. It was a conscientious duty so universally and strongly\r\nfelt, that they were readier to submit to the consequences, whatever\r\nthey might be, than to dishonour themselves by renouncing it. In other\r\nwords, they were ready to face a new war, abandoned to their fate by\r\nall Europe, to undergo a new invasion, which meant the utter\r\ndestruction of their country, rather than leave their Lombard and\r\nVenetian fellow-countrymen to the revenge of Austria. Count Pralormo\r\nadded that he was speaking not only in the name of the ministry, but\r\nof the King and the whole nation. The risk was no imaginary one; there\r\nwere many in Austria who desired an excuse for crushing the life out\r\nof the small state which was the eternal thorn in the side of that\r\ngreat Empire. Few remember now the sufferings of Piedmont for Italy,\r\nor the perils, only too real, which she braved again and again, not\r\nfrom selfish motives--for the Piedmontese of the old, narrow school,\r\nwho said that their orderly little country had nothing to gain from\r\nbeing merged in a state of 25,000,000 were by no means in error--but\r\nfrom genuine Italian fellow-feeling for their less happy compatriots\r\nbeyond their confines.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the armistice concluded on the morrow of Novara had been\r\nprolonged for five months, the treaty of peace was signed. Prince\r\nSchwarzenberg offered to further reduce the indemnity, 75,000,000 to\r\n71,000,000, but D'Azeglio having agreed to the former figure,\r\npreferred to abide by his agreement. He thought, probably, that he\r\nwould thus gain some concession as to the amnesty, and, in fact,\r\nAustria finally consented to pardon all but a small number of the\r\npersons compromised in the late events. D'Azeglio still stood out, but\r\nfinding that there was no shadow of a chance of obtaining more than\r\nthis, he reluctantly accepted it. The great mass, the hundred thousand\r\nand more fugitives who had left their homes in Lombardy and Venetia,\r\nwere, at any rate, promised a safe return. The city of Venice, as yet\r\nundominated, though on the brink of her fall, was totally excluded.\r\nThe list of those whose banishment from Lombardy was confirmed,\r\ncomprises the noblest names in the province; with the exception of a\r\nfew who were excluded from the amnesty on the score that, before the\r\nrevolution, they were Austrian functionaries, nearly every unpardoned\r\nLombard was noble: Casati, Arese, Borromeo, Litta, Greppi,\r\nPallavicini, and the Princess Cristina Belgiojoso of Milan, the two\r\nCamozzis of Bergamo, and G. Martinengo Cesaresco of Brescia.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that this amnesty ushered in a reign of\r\noblivion and mildness. It seemed, rather, that Austria, afraid of the\r\nmoral consequences of the return of so many unloving subjects,\r\nredoubled her severity. The day following the promulgation of the\r\namnesty was the 18th of August, the Emperor of Austria's birthday. In\r\nthe morning, placards dissuading the citizens from taking part in the\r\nofficial rejoicings were to be seen on the walls of Milan. The persons\r\nwho put these up were not caught, but in the course of the day a\r\ncrowd, consisting of all classes, made what the official report called\r\n'a scandalous and anti-politic demonstration,' raising revolutionary\r\ncries, and even saying uncomplimentary things of His Majesty, and\r\nworse still, of the Austrian soldiers. During this 'shameful scene,'\r\nof which the above is the Austrian and hence the most highly-coloured\r\ndescription, the military arrested at hazard some of the crowd, who,\r\nby a 'superior order,' were condemned to the following pains and\r\npenalties:--\r\n\r\n     1. Angelo Negroni, of Padua, aged thirty, proprietor, forty\r\n      strokes;\r\n\r\n     2. Carlo Bossi, watchmaker, aged twenty-two, forty strokes;\r\n\r\n     3. Paolo Lodi, of Monza, student, aged twenty-one, thirty strokes;\r\n\r\n     4. Giovanni Mazzuchetti, Milanese, barrister, aged twenty-four,\r\n     thirty strokes;\r\n\r\n     5. Bonnetti, Milanese, lithographer, aged thirty-one, fifty\r\n     strokes;\r\n\r\n     6. Moretti, Milanese, domestic servant, aged twenty-six, fifty\r\n     strokes;\r\n\r\n     7. Cesana, artist, aged thirty-two, forty strokes;\r\n\r\n     8. Scotti, shopkeeper, of Monza, fifty strokes;\r\n\r\n     9. Vigorelli, Milanese, proprietor, fifty strokes;\r\n\r\n     10. Garavaglia, of Novara, aged thirty-nine, thirty strokes;\r\n\r\n     11. Giuseppe Tandea, Milanese, aged forty, twenty-five strokes;\r\n\r\n     12. Rossi, Milanese, student, thirty strokes;\r\n\r\n     13. Carabelli, workman, forty strokes;\r\n\r\n     14. Giuseppe Berlusconi, fifty strokes;\r\n\r\n     15. Ferrandi, bookseller, thirty strokes;\r\n\r\n     16. Ernestina Galli, of Cremona, operatic singer, aged twenty,\r\n     forty strokes;\r\n\r\n     17. Maria Conti, of Florence, operatic singer, aged eighteen,\r\n     thirty strokes.\r\n\r\nThere were other sentences of imprisonment in irons and on bread and\r\nwater, but the roll of the bastinado, extracted from the official\r\n_Gazzetta di Milano_ may be left to speak for all the rest, and to\r\ntell, with a laconicism more eloquent than the finest rhetoric, what\r\nthe Austrian yoke in Italy really meant.\r\n\r\nA few days after, the military commandant sent the Milanese\r\nMunicipality a bill for thirty-nine florins, the cost of rods broken\r\nor worn-out, and of ice used to prevent gangrene, in the punishment\r\nadministered to the persons arrested on the 18th of August. Sixty\r\nstrokes with the Austrian stick were generally enough to prove fatal.\r\nWomen were flogged half-naked, together with the men, and in the\r\npresence of the Austrian officers, who came to see the spectacle.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty of peace with Austria was signed, there arose a new\r\ndifficulty; the Sardinian Chamber of Deputies refused to approve it.\r\nSome of the deputies asked why they should be called upon either to\r\naccept or reject it, on which they were reminded of the 75,000,000\r\nfrancs indemnity, funds for the discharge of which could not be\r\nlegally raised without a parliamentary vote. The reluctance to share\r\nin an odious though necessary responsibility made these novices in\r\nrepresentative government anxious to throw away the greatest, if not\r\nthe sole guarantee of constitutional freedom. Brofferio, by far the\r\nablest man of the extreme radical party, who had opposed all peace\r\nproposals as long as Rome and Venice still resisted, now advised his\r\nfriends to bow before the inevitable. But they did not comply, and the\r\nministers had no other alternative than to resort to a fresh appeal to\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was serious, because no amount of loyalty on the part of\r\nthe head of the state can save liberty when the representatives of a\r\nnation, taking the bit between their teeth, set themselves\r\ndeliberately to work to make government impossible. People are too\r\nfond of talking of liberty as if it were something locked up in a box\r\nwhich remains safe as long as the guardian of the box does not steal\r\nit or sell it. Liberty is in the charge of all and at the mercy of\r\nall. There were not wanting persons who blamed the new dissolution as\r\nunconstitutional, and who called the proclamation of Moncalieri which\r\nannounced it an act of despotism and of improper interference with the\r\nindependence of the electors. It is hardly too much to say that it was\r\nthis royal proclamation that saved Piedmont. The King appealed to\r\nItaly and to Europe for judgment on the conduct of the late Chamber.\r\nHaving signed, he said, a 'not ruinous' treaty with Austria, which the\r\nhonour of the country and the sanctity of his word required to be\r\nfaithfully executed, the majority sought to make that execution\r\nlegally impracticable. He continued: 'I have promised to save the\r\nnation from the tyranny of parties, whatever be the name, scope and\r\nposition of the men who constitute them. These promises I fulfil by\r\ndissolving a Chamber which had become impossible, and by convoking the\r\nimmediate assemblage of another parliament; but if the electors of the\r\ncountry deny me their help, not on me will fall henceforth the\r\nresponsibility of the future; and if disorders follow, let them\r\ncomplain, not of me, but of themselves. Never, up till now, has the\r\nHouse of Savoy had recourse in vain to the faithfulness, wisdom and\r\nhonour of its peoples. I have therefore the right to trust in them on\r\nthe present occasion, and to hold for certain that, united together,\r\nwe shall save the constitution and the country from the dangers by\r\nwhich they are menaced.'\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation produced a great effect, and the parliament which met\r\non the 20th of December contained a working majority of men who were\r\nnot only patriotic, but who were also endowed with common sense. When\r\nthe ratification of the peace came on for discussion, there was,\r\nindeed, one deputy who spoke in favour of immediate war, which, in a\r\nfortnight, was to effect the liberation, not only of Lombardy and\r\nVenetia, but also of Hungary, a speech worth recalling, as it shows\r\nhow far madness will go. The debate concluded with a vote authorising\r\nthe King's government to fully carry out the treaty of peace which was\r\nconcluded at Milan on the 6th of August 1849, the ayes being 137\r\nagainst 17 noes. Piedmont had learnt the bitter but useful lesson,\r\nthat if you play and lose, you must pay the cost.\r\n\r\nHe who had played and lost his crown had already paid the last fee to\r\nfortune. Charles Albert was now a denizen of the Superga--of all\r\nkings' burial places, the most inspiring in its history, the most\r\nsublime in its situation. Here Victor Amadeus, as he looked down on\r\nthe great French army which, for three months, had besieged his\r\ncapital, vowed to erect a temple if it should please the Lord of Hosts\r\nto grant him and his people deliverance from the hands of the enemy.\r\nFive days later the French were in flight. All the Alps, from Mon Viso\r\nto the Simplon, all Piedmont, and beyond Piedmont, Italy to the\r\nApennines, can be scanned from the church which fulfilled the royal\r\nvow.\r\n\r\nTo the Superga the body of Charles Albert was brought from the place\r\nof exile. Before the coffin, his sword was carried; after it, they led\r\nthe war-horse he had ridden in all the battles. After the war-horse\r\nfollowed a great multitude. He had said truly that it was an opportune\r\ntime for him to die. The pathos of his end rekindled the affections of\r\nthe people for the dynasty.\r\n\r\nAs in the Mosque of dead Sultans in Stamboul, so in the Mausoleum of\r\nthe Superga, each sovereign occupied the post of honour only till the\r\nnext one came to join him. But the post of honour remains, and will\r\nremain, to Charles Albert. His son lies elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF PIEDMONT\r\n\r\n1850-1856\r\n\r\nRestoration of the Pope and Grand Duke of Tuscany--Misrule at\r\nNaples--The Struggle with the Church in Piedmont--The Crimean War.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decade from 1849 to 1859 may seem, at first sight, to resemble an\r\ninterregnum, but it was an evolution. There is no pause in the life of\r\nnations any more than in the life of individuals: they go forward or\r\nthey go backward. In these ten years Piedmont went forward; the other\r\nItalian governments did not stand still, they went backward. The\r\ndiseases from which they suffered gained daily upon the whole\r\nbody-politic, and even those clever foreign doctors who had been the\r\nmost convinced that this or that remedy would set them on their feet,\r\nwere in the end persuaded that there was only one place for them--the\r\nHospital for Incurables. After the fall of Rome, Pius IX. issued a\r\nsort of canticle from Gaeta, in which he thanked the Lord at whose\r\nbidding the stormy ocean had been arrested, but he did not even so\r\nmuch as say thank you to the French, without whom, nevertheless, the\r\nstormy ocean would have proceeded on its way. To all suggestions from\r\nParis that now that victory had been won by force the time was come\r\nfor the Sovereign to give some guarantee that it would not be abused,\r\nthe Pope turned a completely deaf ear. 'The Pope,' said M. Drouyn\r\nde Lhuys, 'prefers to return to Rome upon the dead bodies of his\r\nsubjects rather than amidst the applause which would have greeted him\r\nhad he taken our advice.' That advice referred in particular to the\r\nsecularisation of the public administration, and this was exactly what\r\nthe Pope and the ex-Liberal Cardinal Antonelli, now and henceforth his\r\nmost influential counsellor, were determined not to concede. They had\r\ngrown wise in their generation, for a priest whose ministers are\r\nlaymen is as much an anomaly as a layman whose ministers are priests.\r\nThe French government desired that the Statute should be maintained,\r\nand demanded judicial reforms and an amnesty for political offenders.\r\nNone of these points was accepted except the last, and that only\r\nnominally, as the amnesty of the 18th of September did not put a stop\r\nto proscriptions and vindictive measures. Count Mamiani, whose\r\nstainless character was venerated in all Italy, and who had devoted\r\nall his energies to the attempt to save the Papal government after the\r\nPope's flight, was ruthlessly excluded, and so were many other persons\r\nwho, though liberal-minded, had shown signal devotion to the Holy See.\r\nAll sorts of means were used to serve the ends of vengeance; for\r\ninstance, Alessandro Calandrelli, a Roman of high reputation, who held\r\noffice under the republic, was condemned to death for high treason,\r\nand to twenty years at the galleys, on a trumped-up charge of theft,\r\nwhich was palpably absurd; but the Pope, while quashing the first\r\nsentence, confirmed the second, and Calandrelli would have remained in\r\nprison till the year of grace 1870, as many others did, but for the\r\nchance circumstance that his father had been a friend of the King of\r\nPrussia, who took up his cause so warmly that after two years he was\r\nlet out and sent to Berlin, where the King and A. von Humboldt\r\nreceived him with open arms.\r\n\r\nThese were the auspices under which Pius IX. returned to Rome after\r\nseventeen months' absence. A four-fold invasion restored the Temporal\r\nPower, which Fénelon said was the root of all evil to the Church, but\r\nwhich, according to Pius IX., was necessary to the preservation of the\r\nCatholic religion. The re-established _régime_ was characterised by\r\nLord Clarendon at the Congress of Paris as 'the opprobrium of Europe.'\r\nThe Pope tried to compensate for his real want of independence (for a\r\nprince who could not stand a day without foreign bayonets, whatever\r\nelse he was, was not independent) by laughing at the entreaties of\r\nFrance to relieve that advanced nation from the annoyance of having\r\nset up a government fit for the Middle Ages. He rated at its correct\r\nvalue the support of Napoleon, and believing it to be purely\r\ninterested, he believed in its permanence. The President had thought\r\nof nothing in the world but votes, and he thought of them still. The\r\nRoman Expedition secured him the services of M. de Falloux as\r\nminister, and won over to him the entire Clerical Party, including\r\nMontalembert and the so-called Liberal Catholics. Thus, and thus only,\r\nwas the leap from the Presidential chair to the Imperial throne made\r\npossible. The result was flattering, but still there are reasons to\r\nthink (apart from Prince Jérôme Napoleon's express statement to that\r\neffect) that Napoleon III. hated the whole business from the bottom of\r\nhis soul, and that of his not few questionable acts, this was the only\r\none of which he felt lastingly ashamed. Seeing that the communications\r\nof his ministers failed in their object, he tried the expedient of\r\nwriting a private letter to his friend Edgar Ney, couched in the\r\nstrongest terms of disapproval of the recalcitrant attitude of the\r\nPapal Government. This letter was published as it was intended to be,\r\nbut in the Roman States, except that its circulation was forbidden, no\r\nnotice was taken of it. Though the incident may be regarded as a\r\nstroke of facing-both-ways policy, the anger expressed was probably as\r\nsincere as any of Napoleon's sentiments could be, and the letter had\r\nthe effect of awakening the idea in many minds that something of the\r\nformer Italian conspirator still existed in the ruler of France. The\r\nquestion arose, What sort of pressure would be needed to turn that\r\ngerm to account for Italy?\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Naples, where the laws, to look at them on paper,\r\nwere incomparably better than those in force in the Roman States, the\r\nadministration was such as would have disgraced a remote province of\r\nthe Turkish Empire. The King's naturally suspicious temperament was\r\nworked upon by his courtiers and priests till he came to detect in\r\nevery Liberal a personal antagonist, whose immunity from harm was\r\nincompatible with his own, and in Liberalism a plague dangerous to\r\nsociety, which must be stamped out at all costs. Over 800 Liberals\r\nwere sent to the galleys. The convictions were obtained, in a great\r\nproportion of cases, by false testimony. Bribes and secret protection\r\nin high quarters were the only means by which an innocent man could\r\nhope to escape; 50,000 persons were under police supervision, to be\r\nimprisoned at will. The police often refused to set at liberty those\r\nwhom the judges had acquitted. The government had a Turkish or Russian\r\nfear of printed matter. A wretched barber was fined 1000 ducats for\r\nhaving in his possession a volume of Leopardi's poems, which was\r\ndescribed as 'contrary to religion and morals.'\r\n\r\nWhat was meant by being an inmate of a Neapolitan prison was told by\r\nMr Gladstone in his two 'Letters to the Earl of Aberdeen,' which the\r\nlatter sent to Prince Schwarzenberg, the Austrian Prime Minister, with\r\na strong appeal to him to make known their contents to the King of the\r\nTwo Sicilies, and to use his influence in procuring a mitigation of\r\nthe abuses complained of. Prince Schwarzenberg did nothing, and it was\r\nthen that the 'Letters' were published. The impression created on\r\npublic opinion was almost without a parallel. The celebrated phrase,\r\n'The negation of God erected into a system of government,' passing\r\ninto currency as a short history of Bourbon rule at Naples, kept\r\nalive the wrathful feelings which the 'Letters' aroused, even when\r\nthese ceased to be read. Some small errors of fact (such as that of\r\nstating that all the prisoners were chained, whereas an exception was\r\nmade of those undergoing life sentences) were magnified by the\r\npartisans of Ferdinand II.; but the truth of the picture as a whole\r\nwas amply confirmed from independent sources. Baron Carlo Poerio\r\n(condemned to nineteen years' imprisonment) _was_ chained to a common\r\nmalefactor, the chain never being undone, and producing in the end a\r\ndisease of the bone from which he never recovered. His case was that\r\nof all the political prisoners in the same category with himself.\r\nLuigi Settembrini and the others on whom sentence of death had been\r\npassed, but commuted into one of life imprisonment, were not chained,\r\nbut they were put to associate with the worst thieves and assassins,\r\nwhile their material surroundings accorded with the moral atmosphere\r\nthey were forced to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan prisoners did more than suffer for freedom; they\r\ndelivered the name of their country from being a reproach among the\r\nnations. They showed what men the South of Italy can produce. Those\r\nwho wish to know what types of probity, honour and ideal patriotism\r\nmay grow out of that soil, which is sometimes charged with yielding\r\nonly the rank weeds planted by despotism, may read the letters and\r\nmemoirs of the noble Poerios, of Settembrini, gentlest but most\r\nfearless of human souls, of the Calabrian Morellis, all patriots and\r\nmartyrs; of the Duke of Castromediano, who lately, in his old age, has\r\nset down a few recollections of the years he spent at the Neapolitan\r\ngalleys. He records in these notes what he calls the most perilous\r\nmoment in his life. It was when he was summoned, with six\r\nfellow-prisoners who had asked for and obtained freedom, to hear, as\r\nhe feared, his own pardon pronounced. For pardon was equivalent to\r\ndishonour; it was granted either in consequence of real submission and\r\nretraction, or in order to be able to blacken the character of the\r\npardoned man by falsely asserting that such submission had been made.\r\nHis fear was groundless. He had been led out, perhaps, in the hope\r\nthat the example of the others would prove contagious. He was not\r\npardoned. As he returned to his prison, he thanked Divine Providence\r\nfor the chains which left him pure.\r\n\r\nStrange to tell, Ferdinand II. rendered one considerable service to\r\nthe national cause; not that he saw it in that light, but the service\r\nwas none the less real because its motive was a narrow one. Austria\r\nproposed a defensive league between the Italian Sovereigns: defensive\r\nnot only with the view to outward attack, but also and chiefly against\r\n'internal disorder.' Piedmont was to be invited to join as soon as she\r\nhad renounced her constitutional sins, which it was sanguinely\r\nexpected she would do before very long. Meanwhile Parma, Modena,\r\nTuscany and Rome embraced the idea with enthusiasm, but the King of\r\nthe Two Sicilies, who dimly saw in it an opening for interference in\r\nhis own peculiar governmental ways, boldly declined to have anything\r\nto do with it. And so, to Prince Schwarzenberg's serious\r\ndisappointment, the scheme by which he had hoped to create an\r\nabsolutist Italian federation, came to an untimely end.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke of Tuscany timidly inquired of the Austrian premier if\r\nhe might renew the constitutional _régime_ in his state. Schwarzenberg\r\nreplied with the artful suggestion that he should hear what the Dukes\r\nof Modena and Parma, the Pope, and King Ferdinand had to say on the\r\nsubject. Their advice was unanimously negative: Cardinal Antonelli\r\ngoing so far as to declare that Constitutionalism in Tuscany would be\r\nregarded as a constant menace and danger to the States of the Church.\r\nThe different counsels of Piedmont, conveyed by Count Balbo, weighed\r\nlittle against so imposing an array of opinion, backed as it was by\r\nthe Power which still stabled its horses in the Convent of San Marco.\r\nThe Tuscan Statute was formally suspended in September 1850.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth, Tuscany sank lower and lower in the slough. To\r\nplease the Pope, havoc was made of the Leopoldine laws--named after\r\nthe son of Maria Theresa, the wise Grand Duke Leopold I.--laws by\r\nwhich a bridle was put on the power and extension of the Church. The\r\nprosecution and imprisonment of a Protestant couple who were accused\r\nof wishing to make proselytes, proclaimed the depth of intolerance\r\ninto which what was once the freest and best-ordered government in\r\nItaly had descended.\r\n\r\nThe ecclesiastical question became the true test question in Piedmont\r\nas well as in Tuscany, but there it had another issue.\r\n\r\nIt had also a different basis. In Piedmont there were no Leopoldine\r\nlaws to destroy; what was necessary was to create them. To privileges\r\ndating from the Middle Ages which in the kingdom of Sardinia almost\r\nalone had been restored without curtailment after the storm of the\r\nFrench Revolution, were added the favours, the vast wealth, the\r\npreponderating influence acquired during Charles Felix' reign, and the\r\nfirst seventeen years of that of Charles Albert. Theoretically, the\r\nStatute swept away all privileges of classes and sects, and made\r\ncitizens equal before the law, but to put this theory into practice\r\nfurther legislation was needed, because, as a matter of fact, the\r\nclergy preserved their immunities untouched and showed not the\r\nslightest disposition to yield one jot of them. The Piedmontese\r\nclergy, more numerous in proportion to the population than in any\r\nstate except Rome, were more intransigent than any ecclesiastical body\r\nin the world. The Italian priest of old days, whatever else might be\r\nsaid about him, was rarely a fanatic. The very nickname 'Ultramontane'\r\ngiven by Italians to the religious extremists north of the Alps, shows\r\nhow foreign such excesses were to their own temperaments. But the\r\nUltramontane spirit had already invaded Piedmont, and was embraced by\r\nits clergy with all the zeal of converts. There was still a _Foro\r\nEcclesiastico_ for the arraignment of religious offenders, and this\r\nwas one of the first privileges against which Massimo d'Azeglio lifted\r\nhis 'sacrilegious' hand. To go through all the list would be tedious,\r\nand would demand more explanation regarding the local modes of\r\nacquisition and tenure of religious property than would be interesting\r\nnow. The object of the Siccardi laws, as they were named after the\r\nMinister of Grace and Justice who introduced them, and of the stronger\r\nmeasures to which they led up, was to make the priest amenable to the\r\ncommon law of the land in all except that which referred to his\r\nspiritual functions; to put a limit on the amassment of wealth by\r\nreligious corporations; to check the multiplication of convents and\r\nthe multiplication of feast days, both of which encouraged the people\r\nin sloth and idleness; to withdraw education from the sole control of\r\necclesiastics; and finally, to authorise civil marriage, but without\r\nmaking it compulsory. The programme was large, and it took years to\r\ncarry it out. The Vatican contended that it was contrary to the\r\nConcordat which existed between the Holy See and the Court of\r\nSardinia. Massimo d'Azeglio replied that the maintenance of the\r\nConcordat, in all its parts, meant the ruin of the state; that he had\r\ntried every means of conciliation, made every effort towards arriving\r\nat a compromise, and that since his endeavours had failed in\r\nconsequence of the refusal of the Vatican to abate pretensions which\r\nit neither could nor did enforce in Austria, Naples or Spain, heaven\r\nand the world must judge between Rome and Piedmont, between Cardinal\r\nAntonelli and himself.\r\n\r\nThe struggle throughout was bitter in the extreme, but its most\r\nstriking incident was the denial of the last Sacraments to a member of\r\nthe Government, the Minister of Agriculture, Santa Rosa, who happened\r\nto die soon after the passing of the Act abolishing the _Foro\r\nEcclesiastico_. Santa Rosa was a sincerely religious man, but he\r\nresisted all the attempts of the priest to extort a retractation, and\r\ndied unabsolved rather than leave a dishonoured name to his children.\r\n\r\nThe popular indignation excited by this incident was in proportion\r\nwith the importance attached to outward observances of religion in\r\nCatholic countries; the government had to protect the Archbishop of\r\nTurin from violence, while, at the same time, they sent him for a\r\nmonth to the Citadel for having forbidden his clergy to obey the law\r\non the _Foro Ecclesiastico_. He and one or two of the other bishops\r\nwere afterwards expelled from the kingdom. An unwelcome necessity, but\r\nwhose was the fault? In other countries, where the privileges claimed\r\nby the Piedmontese clergy had been abolished for centuries, did the\r\nbishops dictate revolt against the law? If not, why should they do so\r\nin Piedmont?\r\n\r\nThe successor of Santa Rosa in the ministry was Count Cavour, who\r\nthus in 1850 for the first time became an official servant of the\r\nstate. When D'Azeglio submitted the appointment to the King, Victor\r\nEmmanuel remarked that, though he did not object to it in the least,\r\nthey had better take care, as this man would turn them all out before\r\nlong. This man was, in fact, to stand at the helm of Piedmont, with\r\nshort intervals, till he died, and was to carve out from the block of\r\nformless marble, not the Italy of sublime dreams, which, owing her\r\ndeliverance to her sons alone, should arise immaculate from the grave\r\na Messiah among the nations, but the actual Italy which has been\r\naccomplished; imperfect and peccable as human things mostly are,\r\nbelonging rather to prose than to poetry, to matter than to spirit,\r\nbut, for all that, an Italy which is one and is free.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago a great English writer pointed out what the real Italy\r\nwould be, if it were to be; 'The prosperity of nations as of\r\nindividuals,' wrote Mr Ruskin in one of his earliest papers, 'is cold\r\nand hard-hearted and forgetful. The dead lie, indeed, trampled down by\r\nthe living; the place thereof shall know them no more, for that place is\r\nnot in the hearts of the survivors, for whose interest they have made\r\nway. But adversity and ruin point to the sepulchre, and it is not\r\ntrodden on; to the chronicle, and it does not decay. Who would\r\nsubstitute the rush of a new nation, the struggle of an awakening power,\r\nfor the dreamy sleep of Italy's desolation, for the sweet silence of\r\nmelancholy thought, her twilight time of everlasting memories?'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT CAVOUR]\r\n\r\nThere is the case, stated with beautiful lucidity, of the somewhat\r\nghoulish dilettantism which, enjoying tombs, would condemn all\r\nmankind to breathe their atmosphere. It is not, however, in order to\r\ndiscuss that view that the passage is quoted, but because of its\r\nrelevancy to what Cavour attempted and what he did. Never was there a\r\nmind which cherished fewer illusions. He believed that the pursuit of\r\nthe unattainable was still more a political crime than a political\r\nblunder. He was, in this, what is now called an opportunist, and he\r\nwas also an opportunist in believing that though in politics you can\r\nchoose your aim, you can very rarely choose your means. He held (and\r\nthis was the reason that he was so profoundly hated by men of very\r\ndifferent parties) that to accomplish great changes you have to make\r\nsacrifices, not only of the higher sort, but, in a certain sense, also\r\nof the lower. As he thought that the Austrians could not be expelled\r\nfrom Italy for good and all without foreign help, he contemplated from\r\nthe first securing that foreign help, though no one would have been\r\nmore glad than he to do without it. He thought that Italian freedom\r\ncould not be won without a closer alliance with the democratic party\r\nthan politicians like D'Azeglio, who had the fear of the ermine, of\r\ntarnishing its whiteness, would have ever brought themselves to\r\nacquiesce in, and he therefore immediately took steps to establish\r\nthat alliance. Cavour had no faith in the creation of ideally perfect\r\nstates, such as the Monarchy of Dante or the Republic of Mazzini, but\r\nhe did think that a living land was better than a dead one, that the\r\nstruggle of an awakening power, the rush of a new nation, was\r\ninfinitely to be preferred to the desolation of dreamy sleeps, sweet\r\nsilences, and everlasting memories that spelt regrets.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible now to see clearly that if no one had tried for the\r\nunattainable, Cavour would not have found the ground prepared for his\r\nwork. The appreciation of his rank among Italian liberators rests on a\r\ndifferent point, and it is this: without a man of his positive mould,\r\nof his practical genius, of his force of will and force of patience,\r\nwould the era of splendid endeavours have passed into the era of\r\naccomplished facts? If the answer to this is 'No,' then nothing can\r\ntake from Cavour the glory of having conferred an incalculable boon on\r\nthe country which he loved with a love that was not the less strong\r\nbecause it lacked the divinising qualities of imagination.\r\n\r\nAn aristocrat by birth and the inheritor of considerable wealth,\r\nCavour was singularly free from prejudices; his favourite study was\r\npolitical economy, and in quiet times he would probably have given all\r\nhis energies to the interests of commerce and agriculture. He was an\r\nadvocate of free trade, and was, perhaps, the only one of the many\r\nItalians who _fêted_ Mr Cobden on his visit to Italy who cared in the\r\nleast for the motive of his campaign. Cavour understood English\r\npolitics better than they have ever been understood by a foreign\r\nstatesman; his article on Ireland, written in 1843, may still be read\r\nwith profit. Before parliamentary life existed in Piedmont, he took\r\nthe only way open of influencing public opinion by founding a\r\nnewspaper, the _Risorgimento,_ in which he continued to write for\r\nseveral years. In the Chamber of Deputies he soon made his power\r\nfelt--power is the word, for he was no orator in the ordinary sense;\r\nhis speeches read well, as hard hitting and logical expositions, but\r\nthey were not well delivered. Cavour never spoke Italian with true\r\ngrace and ease though he selected it for his speeches, and not French,\r\nwhich was also allowed and which he spoke admirably. His presence,\r\ntoo, did not lend itself to oratory; short and thickset, and careless\r\nin his dress, he formed a contrast to the romantic figure of\r\nD'Azeglio. Yet his prosaic face, when animated, gave an impressive\r\nsense of that attribute which seemed to emanate from the whole man:\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt needed a more wary hand than D'Azeglio's to steer out of the\r\ntroubled waters caused by the ecclesiastical bills, and to put the\r\nfinal touches to the legislation which he, to his lasting honour be it\r\nsaid, had courageously and successfully initiated. In the autumn of\r\n1852 D'Azeglio resigned, and Cavour was requested by the King to form\r\na ministry. He was to remain, with short breaks, at the head of public\r\naffairs for the nine following years.\r\n\r\nAt this time the government of Lombardy and Venetia was vested in\r\nField-Marshal Radetsky, with two lieutenant-governors under him, who\r\nonly executed his orders. Radetsky resided at Verona. Politically and\r\neconomically the two provinces were then undergoing an extremity of\r\nmisery; the diseases of the vines and the silkworms had reached the\r\npoint of causing absolute ruin to the great mass of proprietors who,\r\nreckoning on having always enough to live on, had not laid by. Many\r\nnoble families sank to the condition of peasants. The taxation was\r\nheavier than in any other part of the Austrian Empire; in proof of\r\nwhich it may be mentioned that Lombardy paid 80,000,000 francs into\r\nthe Austrian treasury, which, had the Empire been taxed equally, would\r\nhave given an annual total of 1,100,000,000, whereas the revenue\r\namounted to only 736,000,000. The landtax was almost double what it\r\nwas in the German provinces. Italians, however, have a great capacity\r\nfor supporting such burdens with patience, and it is doubtful whether\r\nthe material aspect of the case did much to increase their hatred of\r\nforeign dominion. Its moral aspect grew daily worse; the terror became\r\nchronic. The possession of a sheet of printed paper issued by the\r\nrevolutionary press at Capolago, on the lake of Lugano, was enough to\r\nsend a man to the gallows. These old, badly printed leaflets, with no\r\nname of author or publisher attached, but chiefly written in the\r\nunmistakable style of Mazzini, can still be picked up in the little\r\nbooksellers' shops in Canton Ticino, and it is difficult to look at\r\nthem without emotion. What hopes were carried by them. What risks were\r\nrun in passing them from hand to hand. Of what tragedies were they not\r\nthe cause! In August 1851, Antonio Sciesa, of Milan, was shot for\r\nhaving one such leaflet on his person. The gendarmes led him past his\r\nown house, hoping that the sight of it would weaken his nerve, and\r\nmake him accept the clemency which was eagerly proffered if he would\r\nreveal the names of others engaged in the patriotic propaganda.\r\n'Tiremm innanz!' ('come along') he said, in his rough Milanese\r\ndialect, and marched incorruptible to death. On a similar charge,\r\nDottesio and Grioli, the latter a priest, suffered in the same year,\r\nand early in 1852 the long trial was begun at Mantua of about fifty\r\npatriots whose names had been obtained by the aid of the bastinado\r\nfrom one or two unhappy wretches who had not the fortitude to endure.\r\nOf these fifty, nine were executed, among whom were the priests\r\nGrazioli and Tazzoli, Count Montanari of Verona, and Tito Speri, the\r\nyoung hero of the defence of Brescia. Speri had a trifling part in the\r\npropaganda, but the remembrance of his conduct in 1849 ensured his\r\ncondemnation. He was deeply attached to the religion in which he was\r\nborn, and his last letters show the fervour of a Christian joined to\r\nthe calmness of a stoic. If he had a regret, it was that he had been\r\nunable to do more for his country; but here too his simple faith\r\nsustained him. Surely the Giver of all good would not refuse to listen\r\nto the prayers of the soul which passed to Him through martyrdom.\r\n'To-morrow they lead me forth,' he wrote. 'I have done with this\r\nworld, but, in the bosom of God, I promise you I will do what I can.'\r\nSo did this clear and childlike spirit carry its cause from the\r\nAustrian Assizes to a higher tribunal.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1853 there was an attempt at a rising in Milan from\r\nwhich the mass of the citizens stood aloof, if they even knew of it\r\ntill it was over; an attempt ill-considered and not easily justified\r\nfrom any point of view, the blame for which has been generally cast on\r\nMazzini; but though he knew of it, he was unwilling that its authors\r\nshould choose the time and mode of action which they chose. He was,\r\nmoreover, misinformed as to the extent of the preparations, since no\r\nMilanese of any standing gave his support to the plan.\r\n\r\nOn the plea that the Lombard emigration was concerned in the abortive\r\nmovement, which was by no means consistent with facts, the Austrian\r\nGovernment sequestered the landed property of the exiles and voluntary\r\nemigrants, reducing them and their families (which in most instances\r\nremained behind) to complete beggary. Nine hundred and seventy-eight\r\nestates were placed under sequestration. The Court of Sardinia held\r\nthe measure to be a violation of the amnesty, which was one of the\r\nconditions of the peace of 1850. The Sardinian Minister was recalled\r\nfrom Vienna, and the relations between the two governments were once\r\nmore on a footing of open rupture.\r\n\r\nNot less important was the moral effect of the sequestrations in\r\nFrance and England, but particularly in England. They acted as the\r\nlast straw, coming as they did on the top of the flogging system which\r\nhad already enraged the English public mind to the highest degree. The\r\nPrince Consort wrote in March to his brother: 'To give you a\r\nconception of the maxims of justice and policy which Austria has been\r\nlately developing, I enclose an extract of a report from Turin which\r\ntreats of the decrees of confiscation in Italy. People here will be\r\nvery indignant.' He goes on to say (somewhat too broadly) that the\r\nEnglish upper classes were till then thoroughly Austrian, but that she\r\nhad succeeded in turning the whole of England against her, and there\r\nwas now no one left to defend her.\r\n\r\nAustria, through Count Buol, complained that she was 'dying of\r\nlegality,' but England took the Sardinian view that the sequestrations\r\ndirectly violated the treaty between the two Powers. In the Austrian\r\nNote of the 9th of March, it was distinctly declared that Piedmont\r\nwould be crushed if she did not perform the part of police-agent to\r\nAustria. Cavour's uncowed attitude at this crisis was what first fixed\r\nupon him the eyes of European diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the summer, the Duke of Genoa, Victor Emmanuel's\r\nbrother, paid a visit to the English Court, where the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Coburg was also staying, by whom he was described as 'one of the\r\ncleverest and most amiable men of our time.' Sunny Italy, adds Duke\r\nErnest, seemed to have sent him to England so that by his mere\r\npresence alone, in the prime of his age, he might make propaganda for\r\nthe cause of his country. The Queen presented her guest with a\r\nhandsome riding-horse, and when he thanked her in warm and feeling\r\nterms, she spoke the memorable words, the effect of which spoken at\r\nthat date by the Queen of England can hardly be imagined: 'I hope you\r\nwill ride this horse when the battles are fought for the liberation of\r\nItaly.'\r\n\r\nThe battle-day was indeed to come, but when it came the sword which\r\nthe young Duke wielded with such gallantry in the siege of Peschiera\r\nwould be sheathed for ever. The Prince Charming of Casa Savoia died in\r\nFebruary 1855, leaving a daughter to Italy, the beloved Queen\r\nMargaret.\r\n\r\nIn the space of a few weeks, Victor Emmanuel lost his brother, his\r\nmother, and his wife. The King, who felt keenly when he did feel, was\r\ndriven distraught with grief; no circumstance was wanting which could\r\nsharpen the edge of his sorrow. The two Queens, both Austrian\r\nprincesses, had never interfered in foreign politics; what they\r\nsuffered they suffered in silence. But they were greatly influenced by\r\nthe ministers of the religion which had been a comfort of their not\r\ntoo happy lives, and they had frequently told Victor Emmanuel that\r\nthey would die of grief if the anti-papal policy of his government\r\nwere persisted in. Now that they were dead, every partisan of the\r\nChurch declared, without a shadow of reticence, that the mourning in\r\nwhich the House of Savoy was plunged was a clear manifestation of\r\nDivine wrath. Victor Emmanuel had been brought up in superstitious\r\nsurroundings; it was hardly possible that he should listen to these\r\nthings altogether unmoved. But on this as on the other occasions in\r\nhis life when he was to be threatened with ghostly terrors, he did not\r\nbelie the name of 'Re Galantuomo,' which he had written down as his\r\nprofession when filling up the papers of the first census taken after\r\nhis accession--a jest that gave him the title he will ever be known\r\nby. Harassed and tormented as the King was, when the law on religious\r\ncorporations had been voted by the Senate and the Chamber, and was\r\npresented to him by Cavour for signature, he did his duty and signed\r\nit. The commentary which came from the Vatican was the decree of\r\nmajor excommunication promulgated in the Consistory of the 27th of\r\nJuly against all who had approved or sanctioned the measure, or who\r\nwere concerned in putting it into execution.\r\n\r\nThe law was known as the 'Rattazziana,' from Urbano Rattazzi, whom\r\nCavour appointed Minister of Grace and Justice, thereby effecting a\r\ncoalition between the Right Centre, which he led himself, and the Left\r\nCentre, which was led by Rattazzi; an alliance not pleasing to the\r\nPure Right or to the Advanced Left, but necessary to give the Prime\r\nMinister sufficient strength to command the respect, both at home and\r\nabroad, which can only be won by a statesman who is not afraid of\r\nbeing overturned by every whiff of the parliamentary wind. The 'Legge\r\nRattazziana' certainly aimed at asserting the supremacy of the state,\r\nbut in substance it was an arrangement for raising the stipend of the\r\npoorer clergy at the expense of the richer benefices and corporations,\r\nand save for the bitter animosity of Rome, it would not have excited\r\nthe degree of anger that descended upon its promoters. In a country\r\nwhere the Church had a rental of 15,000,000 francs, there were many\r\nparish priests who had not an income of £20; a state of things seen to\r\nbe anomalous by the best ecclesiastics themselves, but their efforts\r\nat conciliation failed because the Holy See would not recognise the\r\nright of the civil authority to interfere in any question affecting\r\nthe status or property of the clergy, and this right was the real\r\npoint at issue.\r\n\r\nIn these days, Cavour came to an understanding with a friendly monk in\r\norder that when his last hour arrived, he should not, like Santa Rosa,\r\ngo unshriven to his account. In 1861, Fra Giacomo performed his part\r\nin the agreement, and was duly punished for having saved his Church\r\nfrom a scandal which, from the position of the great minister, would\r\nhave reached European dimensions.\r\n\r\nCavour's work of bringing into order the Sardinian finances, which,\r\nfrom the flourishing state they had attained prior to 1848, had fallen\r\ninto what appeared the hopeless confusion of a large and steadily\r\nincreasing deficit, is not to the ordinary observer his most brilliant\r\nachievement, but it is possibly the one for which he deserves most\r\npraise. It could not have been carried through except by a statesman\r\nwho was completely indifferent to the applause of the hour. During all\r\nthe earlier years that he held office, Cavour was extraordinarily\r\nunpopular. The nickname of 'la bestia neira' conferred on him by\r\nVictor Emmanuel referred to the opinion entertained of him by the\r\nClerical party, but he was almost as much a 'bestia neira' to a large\r\nportion of the Liberals as to the Clericals or to the old Piedmontese\r\nparty. His house was attacked by the mob in 1853, and had not his\r\nservants barred the entrance, something serious might have occurred.\r\nHappily the King and the majority in the Chamber and in the country\r\nhad, if not much love for Cavour, a profound conviction that he could\r\nnot be done without, and that, consequently, he must be allowed to do\r\nwhat he liked. Thus the large sacrifices he demanded of the taxpayers\r\nwere regularly voted, and Cavour could afford to despise the abuse\r\nheaped upon himself since he saw his policy advancing to maturity\r\nalong a steady line of success.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1854, Cavour resolved that Piedmont should join France and\r\nEngland in the coming war with Russia, it seemed to a large number of\r\nhis countrymen that he had taken leave of his senses, but the firm\r\nsupport which in this instance he found in the King enabled him next\r\nyear to equip and despatch the contingent, 15,000 strong, commanded\r\nby General La Marmora, which not only won the respect of friends and\r\nfoes in the field, but offered an example of efficiency in all\r\ndepartments that compared favourably with the faulty organisation of\r\nthe great armies beside which it fought. Its gallant conduct at the\r\nbattle of the Tchernaja flattered the native pride, and when, in due\r\ntime, 12,000 returned of the 15,000 that had gone forth, the increased\r\ncredit of Piedmont in Europe was already felt to compensate for the\r\nheavy cost of the expedition.\r\n\r\nAmong the Italians living abroad, Cavour's motives in taking part in\r\nthe Crimean War were, from the first, better understood than they were\r\nat home. Piedmont, by qualifying for the part of Italian advocate in\r\nthe Councils of Europe, gave a guarantee of good faith which patriots\r\nlike Daniel Manin and Giorgio Pallavicini accepted as a happy promise\r\nfor the future. It was then that a large section of the republican\r\nparty frankly embraced the programme of Italian unity under Victor\r\nEmmanuel. They foresaw that a repetition of the discordant action of\r\n1848 would end in the same way. Manin wrote to Lorenzo Valerio in\r\nSeptember 1855: 'I, who am a republican, plant the banner of\r\nunification; let all who desire that Italy should exist, rally round\r\nit, and Italy will exist.' The ex-dictator of Venice was eking out a\r\nscanty livelihood by giving lessons in Paris; he had only three years\r\nleft to live, and was not destined to see his words verified. But,\r\npoor and sick and obscure though he was, his support was worth\r\nlegions.\r\n\r\nIt was not the first time that Italian republicans had said to the\r\nHouse of Savoy: If you will free Italy we are with you; but the\r\ncircumstances of the case were completely changed since Mazzini wrote\r\nin somewhat the same language to Charles Albert a quarter of a\r\ncentury before. Both times the proposal contained an ultimatum as well\r\nas an offer, but Manin made it without second thoughts in the\r\nstrongest hope that the pact would be accepted and full of\r\nanticipatory joy at the prospect of its success; while by the Genoese\r\nrepublican it was made in mistrust and in the knowledge that were it\r\naccepted (which he did not believe), its acceptance, though bringing\r\nwith it for Italy a state of things which he recognised as preferable\r\nto that which prevailed, would bring to him personally nothing but\r\ndisappointment and the forfeiture of his dearest wishes.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say what were at this date Cavour's own private\r\nsentiments about Italian unity. Though he once confessed that as a\r\nyoung man he had fancied himself Prime Minister of Italy, whenever the\r\nsubject was now discussed he disclaimed any belief in the feasibility\r\nof uniting all parts of the peninsula in one whole. He even called\r\nManin 'a very good man, but mad about Italian unification.' It wanted,\r\nin truth, the prescience of the seer rather than the acumen of the\r\npolitician to discern the unity of Italy in 1855. All outward facts\r\nseemed more adverse to its accomplishment than at any period since\r\n1815. Yet it was for Italy that Cavour always pleaded; Italy, and not\r\nPiedmont or even Lombardy and Venetia. He invariably asserted the\r\nright of his King to uphold the cause of all the populations from the\r\nAlps to the Straits of Messina. If he adopted the proverb 'Chi va\r\npiano va sano,' he kept in view the end of it, 'Chi va sano va\r\nlontano.' In short, if he did not believe in Italian unity, he acted\r\nin the same way as he would have acted had he believed in it.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that one thing he could not do. Whatever was in his\r\nthoughts, unless he was prepared to retire into private life then and\r\nthere, he could not proclaim from the house-tops that he espoused the\r\nartichoke theory attributed to Victor Amadeus. There were only too\r\nmany old diplomatists as it was, who sought to cripple Cavour's\r\nresources by reviving that story. The time was not come when, without\r\nmanifest damage to the cause, he could plead guilty to the charge of\r\npreparing an Italian crown for his Sovereign. 'The rule in politics,'\r\nCavour once observed, 'is to be as moderate in language as you are\r\nresolute in act.'\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1855, Victor Emmanuel, with Cavour and Massimo\r\nd'Azeglio, paid a visit to the French and English Courts. He was\r\nreceived with more marked cordiality at the English Court than at the\r\nFrench. No Prince Charming, indeed, but the ideal of a bluff and burly\r\nLongobard chief, he managed to win the good graces of his\r\nentertainers, even if they thought him a trifle barbaric. The Duchess\r\nof Sutherland declared that of all the knights of St George whom she\r\nhad ever seen, he was the only one who would have had the best of it\r\nin the fight with the dragon. The Queen rose at four o'clock in the\r\nmorning to take leave of him. Cavour was so much struck by the\r\ninterest which Her Majesty evinced in the efforts of Piedmont for\r\nconstitutional freedom, that he did not hesitate to call her the best\r\nfriend his country possessed in England.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known, but it is quite true, that Victor Emmanuel\r\nwished to contract a matrimonial alliance with the English royal\r\nfamily. He did not take Cavour into his confidence, but a high English\r\npersonage was sounded on the matter, a hint being given to him to say\r\nnothing about it to the Count. The lady who might have become Queen of\r\nItaly was the Princess Mary of Cambridge. The negotiations were\r\nbroken off because the young Princess would not hear of any marriage\r\nwhich would have required her living out of England.\r\n\r\nThe Congress which met in Paris in February 1856 for the conclusion of\r\nthe peace between the Allies and Russia was to have far more momentous\r\nresults for Italy than for the countries more immediately concerned in\r\nits discussions, but, contrary to the general impression, it does not\r\nappear that these results were anticipated by Cavour. He even said\r\nthat it was idle for Sardinia to send delegates to a congress in which\r\nthey would be treated like children. Cavour feared, perhaps, to lose\r\nthe ground he had gained in the previous year with Napoleon III., when\r\nthe Emperor's rather surprising question: 'Que peut-on faire pour\r\nl'Italie?' had suggested to the Piedmontese statesman that definite\r\nscheme of a French alliance, which henceforth he never let go. In any\r\ncase, when D'Azeglio, who was appointed Sardinian representative,\r\nrefused at the last moment to undertake a charge for which he knew he\r\nwas not fitted, it was only at the urgent request of the King that\r\nCavour consented to take his place. When once in Paris, however, he\r\nwarmed to the work, finding an unexpectedly strong ally in Lord\r\nClarendon. He won what was considered in all Europe a great diplomatic\r\ntriumph, by getting a special sitting assigned to the examination of\r\nItalian affairs, which had as little to do with the natural work of\r\nthe Congress as the affairs of China. The chief points discussed at\r\nthe secret sitting of the 8th of April were the foreign occupations in\r\nCentral Italy, and the state of the Roman and Neapolitian governments,\r\nwhich was stigmatised by Lord Clarendon in terms much more severe than\r\nCavour himself thought it prudent to use. Count Buol, the chief\r\nAustrian representative, grew very angry, and his opposition was\r\nsuccessful in reducing the sitting to a mere conversation; but what\r\nhad been said had been said, and Cavour prepared the way for his\r\nfuture policy by remarking to everyone: 'You see that diplomacy can do\r\nnothing for us; the question needs another solution.' Lord Clarendon's\r\nvigorous support made him think for a moment that England might take\r\nan active part in that other solution, and with this idea in his mind\r\nhe hurried over the Channel to see Lord Palmerston, but he left\r\nEngland convinced that nothing more than moral assistance was ever to\r\nbe expected from that quarter. The Marquis Emmanuel d'Azeglio, who for\r\nmany years represented Sardinia, and afterwards Italy, at the Court of\r\nSt James, has placed it on record that the English Premier repeatedly\r\nassured him that an armed intervention on behalf of Italian freedom\r\nwould have been much to his taste, but that the country would not have\r\nbeen with him. It is certain that Cavour would have preferred an\r\nEnglish to a French alliance; as it was not to be had, he reposed his\r\nsole hopes in the Emperor Napoleon, who had not the French people\r\nreally more with him in this matter than Lord Palmerston had the\r\nEnglish--nay, he had them less with him, for in England there would\r\nhave been a party of Italian sympathisers favourable to the war, and\r\nin France, there was no one except Prince Napoleon and the workmen of\r\nParis. But the French Emperor was a despotic sovereign, and not the\r\nPrime Minister of a self-governing country. After all, some good may\r\ncome out of despotism.\r\n\r\nUpon Cavour's return to Turin, he received not only the approval of\r\nthe King and Parliament, but also congratulations from all parts of\r\nItaly. His position had gained immensely in strength, both at home and\r\nabroad. Yet the power of the Clerical party in Piedmont was still such\r\nthat, in the elections of 1857--the first that had taken place since\r\nthe legislation affecting the Church--they obtained seventy seats out\r\nof a total of two hundred. Cavour did not conceal his alarm. What if\r\neight years' labour were thrown away, and the movement of the State\r\nturned backward? 'Never,' he said, 'would he advise a _coup d'état,_\r\nnor would his master resort to one; but if the King abdicated, what\r\nthen?' Victor Emmanuel said to his Prime Minister: 'Let us do our\r\nduty; stand firm, and we shall see!' He often declared that, sooner\r\nthan beat a retreat from the path he had entered on, he would go to\r\nAmerica and become plain _Monsù Savoia_; but he never lost faith in\r\nthe predominating patriotism and good sense of his subjects; and at\r\nthis time, as at others, he proved to be right. The crisis was\r\nsurmounted. On the one hand, some elections were invalidated where the\r\npriests had exercised undue influence; and, on the other, Rattazzi,\r\nwho was especially obnoxious to the Clerical party, retired from\r\noffice. Cavour thus found himself still able to command the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPREMONITIONS OF THE STORM\r\n\r\n1857-1858\r\n\r\nPisacane's Landing--Orsini's Attempt--The Compact of\r\nPlombières--Cavour's Triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the accusation of favouring political assassination which\r\nwas frequently launched against the Italian secret societies, only one\r\nof the faithless Italian princes came to a violent death, and his\r\nmurder had no connection with politics. Charles III., Duke of Parma,\r\nwas mortally stabbed in March 1854; some said that the assassin was a\r\ngroom whom he had struck with a riding-whip; others, that he was the\r\nfather or brother of one of the victims of the Duke's dissolute\r\nhabits. The Duchess, a daughter of the Duke de Berry, assumed the\r\nRegency on behalf of her son, who was a child. She began by initiating\r\nmany reforms; but a street disturbance in July gave Austria the\r\ndesired excuse for meddling in the government, when all progress was,\r\nof course, arrested.\r\n\r\nIn December 1856, a soldier named Ageslao Milano attempted to\r\nassassinate the King of the Two Sicilies at a review. He belonged to\r\nno sect, but he had long premeditated the act. A few days later an\r\nearthquake occurred in the kingdom of Naples, by which over ten\r\nthousand persons lost their lives. Ferdinand II. grew morose, and shut\r\nhimself up in the royal palace of Caserta. The constant lectures of\r\nFrance and England annoyed him without persuading him to take the\r\nmeans to put a stop to them. Not till 1859 did he open the doors of\r\nthe prisons in which Poerio, Settembrini and their companions were\r\nconfined. Many plans were made, meanwhile, for their liberation, and\r\nEnglish friends even provided a ship by which they were to escape; but\r\nthe ship foundered: perhaps fortunately, as Garibaldi, with\r\ncharacteristic disinterestedness, had agreed to direct the enterprise,\r\nwhich could not have been otherwise than perilous, and was not\r\nunlikely to end in the loss of all concerned.\r\n\r\nDisaster attended Baron Bentivegna's attempt at a rising at Taormina\r\nin 1856, and Carlo Pisacane's landing at Sapri in the summer of the\r\nfollowing year had no better result. Pisacane, a son of the Duke\r\nGennaro di San Giovanni of Naples, had fought in the defence of Rome\r\nand was a firm adherent of Mazzini, in conjunction with whom he\r\nplanned his unlucky venture. Pisacane watched the growing ascendency\r\nof Piedmont with sorrow; he was one of the few, if not the only one of\r\nhis party to say that he would as soon have the dominion of Austria as\r\nthat of the House of Savoy. But if he was an extremist in politics,\r\nnone the less he was a patriot, who took his life in his hands and\r\noffered it up to his country in the spirit of the noblest devotion. He\r\nhad the slenderest hope of success, but he believed that only by such\r\nfailures could the people be roused from their apathy. 'For me,' he\r\nwrote, 'it will be victory even if I die on the scaffold. This is all\r\nI can do, and this I do; the rest depends on the country, not on me. I\r\nhave only my affections and my life to give, and I give them without\r\nhesitation.'\r\n\r\nWith the young Baron Nicotera and twenty-three others, Pisacane\r\nembarked on the _Cagliari_, a steamer belonging to a Sardinian\r\nmercantile line, which was bound for Tunis. When at sea, the captain\r\nwas frightened into obedience, and the ship's course was directed to\r\nthe isle of Ponza, where several hundred prisoners, mostly political,\r\nwere undergoing their sentences. The guards made little resistance,\r\nand Pisacane opened the prisons, inviting who would to follow him. The\r\nfirst plan had been to make a descent on San Stefano, the island where\r\nSettembrini was imprisoned, but that good citizen had refused to admit\r\nthe liberation of the non-political prisoners, which was an\r\nunavoidable feature in the scheme. With the addition of about three\r\nhundred men, Pisacane left Ponza for the mainland and disembarked near\r\nthe village of Sapri, in the province of Salerno. From information\r\nreceived, he imagined that a revolutionary movement was on the point\r\nof breaking out in that district. Nothing could be further from the\r\nfact. The country people did all the harm they could to the band,\r\nwhich, after making a brave stand against the local militia, was cut\r\nto pieces by the royal troops. Pisacane fell fighting; those who were\r\nnot killed were taken, and amongst these was Nicotera, who was kept in\r\nprison till set free by Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nThe _Cagliari_ was captured and detained with its crew. As two of the\r\nseamen were British subjects, the English Government joined Sardinia\r\nin demanding its restitution, which, after long delays, was conceded.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the Emperor of Austria relieved Field-Marshal Radetsky, then\r\nin his ninety-third year, of the burden of office. He was given the\r\nright of living in any of the royal palaces, even in the Emperor's own\r\nresidence at Vienna, but he preferred to spend the one remaining year\r\nof his life in Italy. At the same time, the Archduke Maximilian was\r\nappointed Viceroy of Lombardy and Venetia. A more naturally amiable\r\nand cultivated Prince never had the evil fate forced upon him of\r\nattempting impossible tasks. Just married to the lovely Princess\r\nCharlotte of Belgium, he came to Italy radiant with happiness, and\r\nwishing to make everyone as happy as he was himself. Not even the\r\nchilling welcome he received damped his enthusiasm, for he thought the\r\naversion of the population depended on undoubted wrongs, which it was\r\nhis full intention to redress. He was to learn two things; firstly,\r\nthat the day of reconciliation was past: there were too many ghosts\r\nbetween the Lombards and Venetians, and the House of Hapsburg.\r\nSecondly, that an unseen hand beyond the Brenner would diligently\r\nthwart each one of his benevolent designs. The system was, and was to\r\nremain, unchanged. It was not carried out quite as it was carried out\r\nin the first years after 1849. The exiles were allowed to return and\r\nthe sequestrations were revoked. It should be said, because it shows\r\nthe one white spot in Austrian despotism, its civil administration,\r\nthat on resuming their rights of ownership the proprietors found that\r\ntheir estates had not been badly managed. But the depressing and\r\ndeadening influence of an anti-national rule continued unabated.\r\nLombardy and Venetia were governed not from Milan, but from Vienna.\r\nVery small were the crumbs which the Viceroy obtained, though he went\r\non a journey to Austria expressly to plead for concessions. It is sad\r\nto think what an enlightened heir to the great Austrian empire was\r\nlost, when Napoleon III. and his own family sent Maximilian of\r\nHapsburg to Queretaro.\r\n\r\nWhile Cavour had come to the conclusion that the aid which he believed\r\nessential for the expulsion of the Austrians could only come from the\r\nFrench Emperor, this sovereign was regarded by a not inconsiderable\r\nparty of Italians as the greatest, if not the sole, obstacle to their\r\nliberation. All those, in particular, who came in contact with the\r\nFrench exiles, were impressed by them with the notion that France, the\r\nreal France, was only waiting for the disappearance of the Man of\r\nDecember to throw herself into their arms. Among the Italians who held\r\nthese opinions, there were a few with whom it became a fixed idea that\r\nthe greatest service they could render their country was the removal\r\nof Napoleon from the political scene. They conceived and nourished\r\nthe thought independently of one another; they belonged to no league,\r\nbut for that reason they were the more dangerous; somewhere or other\r\nthere was always someone planning to put an end to the Emperor's life.\r\nIt is not worth while to pause to discuss the ethics of political\r\nassassination; civilisation has decided against it, and history proves\r\nits usual failure to promote the desired object. What benefit did the\r\nConfederate cause derive from the assassination of the good President\r\nLincoln, or the cause of Russian liberty from that of Alexander II.?\r\nWhat will Anarchy gain by the murder of Carnot? It is certain,\r\nhowever, that never were men more convinced that they were executing a\r\nwild kind of justice than were the men who plotted against Napoleon\r\nIII. They looked upon him as one of themselves who had turned traitor.\r\nThere is a great probability that, in his early days when he was\r\nplaying at conspiracy in Italy, he was actually enrolled as a\r\nCarbonaro. At all events, he had conspired for Italian freedom, and\r\nafterwards, to serve his own selfish interests, he extinguished it in\r\nRome. The temporal power of the Pope was kept alive through him.\r\n\r\nA true account of the attempts on Napoleon's life will never be written,\r\nbecause the only persons who were able and willing to throw light on the\r\nsubject, ex-police agents and their kind, are authorities whose word is\r\nworth a very limited acceptance. It is pretty sure that there were more\r\nplots than the public ever knew of, and that in some cases the plotters\r\nwere disposed of summarily. Most of them were poor, ignorant creatures,\r\nbut in January 1858 an attempt was made by a man of an entirely\r\ndifferent stamp, Felice Orsini.\r\n\r\nBorn at Meldola in Romagna in 1819, he was of the true Romagnol type\r\nin mind and body; daring, resourceful, intolerant of control. From his\r\nearliest youth all his actions had but one object, the liberation of\r\nhis country. His youthful brain was enflamed by Alfieri and Foscolo,\r\nwho remained his favourite authors. He hated Austria well, and he\r\nhated the Papal government as no one but one of its own subjects could\r\nhate it. 'When the French landed in Italy' (he told his judges) 'it\r\nwas hoped that they were come as friends, but they proved the worst of\r\nenemies. For a time they were repulsed, then they resumed the cloak of\r\nfriendship, but only to wait for reinforcements. When these arrived\r\nthey returned to the assault, a thousand against ten, and we were\r\njudicially assassinated.' A succinct and true narrative.\r\n\r\nDuring the republic Orsini was sent to Ancona, where anarchy had\r\nbroken out; by vigorous measures he restored perfect order. In 1854 he\r\nwas arrested in Hungary and condemned to death, but he escaped from\r\nMantua under romantic circumstances and reached England, where the\r\nstory of his audacious flight won for him many sympathisers. He was\r\noften seen in society. On one occasion he was asked to meet Prince\r\nLucien Buonaparte. Orsini knew Mazzini, but he was impatient of his\r\nmystical leanings, and he disapproved of such enterprises as\r\nPisacane's, by which, as he thought, twenty or thirty men were\r\nsacrificed here or there without anything coming of it. He finally\r\nrepudiated Mazzini's leadership, and in March 1857 he wrote to Cavour,\r\nasking him for a passport to return to Italy, and placing at the\r\ndisposal of the Sardinian government 'the courage and energy which it\r\nhad pleased God to give him,' provided that government left wavering\r\nbehind, and showed its unmistakable will to achieve the independence\r\nof Italy. Cavour sent no reply, 'because,' he said later, 'the letter\r\nwas noble and energetic, and I should have had to pay Orsini\r\ncompliments which I did not deem fitting. 'Unlike Victor Emmanuel, who\r\nin after years carried on regular negotiations with Mazzini, Cavour,\r\nwhile ready to make an alliance with the Radicals in the Chamber, was\r\nextremely loth to have anything to do with actual revolutionists. His\r\nnot answering Orsini's letter certainly led up to the attempt of the\r\n14th of January 1858.\r\n\r\nHaving quarrelled with Mazzini, and receiving no encouragement from\r\nCavour, Orsini evolved the plan which on that day he endeavoured to\r\nput into execution. He would have preferred to act alone, but since\r\nthat was impossible, he sought and found without much difficulty two\r\nor three accomplices. One of these, Pieri, a teacher of languages, was\r\narrested by the police, who recognised him as an old conspirator,\r\nbefore he threw the bomb which he was carrying. The other bombs were\r\nthrown just as the carriage containing the Imperial party drove up to\r\nthe opera house. A number of people in the street were killed or\r\ninjured, but the Emperor and Empress escaped unhurt. When they entered\r\nthe theatre the Rutli scene of the conspirators in _Guillaume Tell_\r\nwas being performed. Not a breath of applause greeted them, though\r\neveryone knew what had happened. Napoleon III. had a striking proof of\r\nhow little hold he possessed on the affections of his subjects.\r\n\r\nWhen at his trial Orsini was asked what he expected would happen if he\r\nhad succeeded in killing the Emperor he answered: 'We were convinced\r\nthat the surest way of making a revolution in Italy was to excite one\r\nin France, and that the surest way of making a revolution in France\r\nwas to kill the Emperor.' There is a good deal of curious evidence to\r\nshow that very elaborate preparations had been made for a revolution\r\nin Paris. The French police had orders, however, to keep all this\r\naspect of the affair out of sight. It was to be made to appear the\r\nisolated act of a misguided Italian patriot. 'The world possesses an\r\nOrsini legend,' writes the late Duke of Saxe-Coburg, who was present\r\nat the event, having been invited to join the Emperor at the opera,\r\n'which is quite at variance with facts.' The duke clearly thinks that\r\nthe conviction of the instability of his throne which was brought home\r\nto the Emperor on this occasion, was one of the causes which decided\r\nhim to try the diversion of public opinion into other channels by\r\nmeans of a foreign war.\r\n\r\nEverything was done to make Orsini a hero in the eyes of the French\r\npublic, and to excite sympathy in his cause. Jules Favre by his\r\neloquent defence in which he pleaded not for the life, but for the\r\nhonour of his client, and still more Orsini's own letter to the\r\nEmperor, produced a powerful impression; there was a dramatic interest\r\nin the man who, disdaining to crave clemency for himself, tried a last\r\nsupreme effort in the service of the country he had loved too well.\r\n'Deliver my fatherland, and the blessings of twenty-five million\r\ncitizens will be with you.' So concluded the letter in which Orsini\r\ntold Napoleon, that till Italy was free there would be no peace for\r\nEurope--nor for him. It was whispered that the Emperor had a secret\r\ninterview with the condemned man at the Mazas prison; at any rate,\r\nwhen Orsini mounted the scaffold, he was borne up, not only by his\r\ninvincible courage, but by the strongest hope, if not the certainty\r\nthat his last prayer would have only a short time to wait for\r\nfulfilment.\r\n\r\nThough persons who were able to read the signs of the times no longer\r\ndoubted that Napoleon had resolved to solve the Italian question by\r\nforce of arms, it suited his purpose to occupy the public mind for the\r\nmoment with the furious agitation against England and Piedmont as\r\n'dens of assassins,' which led to the fall of the Palmerston\r\nadministration on the Conspiracy Bill, and seemed to almost place in\r\njeopardy the throne of Victor Emmanuel. Napoleon sent the King of\r\nSardinia demands so sweeping in language so threatening, that the old\r\nSavoy blood was fired, and Victor Emmanuel returned the answer: 'Tell\r\nthe Emperor in whatever terms you think best that this is not the way\r\nto treat a faithful ally; that I have never tolerated violence from\r\nanyone; that I follow the path of unstained honour, and for that\r\nhonour I am only answerable to God and to my people. That we have\r\ncarried our head high for 850 years, and no one will make me lower it;\r\nand that, nevertheless, I desire nothing better than to remain his\r\nfriend.' This reply was benevolently received; Cavour passed through\r\nthe Chambers a bill which, though not corresponding to the extravagant\r\npretensions of the French Government, gave reasonable security against\r\nthe concoction of plots of a criminal nature; Napoleon expressed\r\nhimself satisfied, and three months after, despatched Dr Conneau to\r\nTurin, to mention, quite by the way, to the Piedmontese minister, that\r\nhe would be glad to have a conversation with him on Italian affairs.\r\nThis was the preliminary of the interview of Plombières.\r\n\r\nPlombières is a watering-place in the Vosges, which became famous on\r\nthe 20th of July 1858, the day on which Napoleon III. and Cavour\r\nentered into the compact that laid down the conditions of the Italian\r\nwar. The Emperor was to bring 200,000 men into Italy, and the King of\r\nSardinia undertook to furnish 100,000. The Austrians were to be\r\nexpelled from Italy. The kingdom of Upper Italy would embrace the\r\nLegations and the Marches then under the Pope. Savoy would be ceded\r\nto France. The marriage of the Emperor's cousin with the Princess\r\nClotilde was not made a condition of the war, and only in case it had\r\nbeen made a condition, was Cavour empowered to agree to it. He,\r\ntherefore, left it uncertain; but he came away from Plombières\r\nconvinced that nearly everything depended upon its happening. Napoleon\r\nwas beyond measure anxious for a marriage which would ally him with\r\none of the oldest reigning families in Europe. It would be a fatal\r\nmistake, Cavour thought, to join the Emperor, and at the same time, to\r\noffend him in a way which he would never forget. Directly after the\r\ninterview, he wrote a long letter to the King to persuade him to yield\r\nthe point. After all, where would the Princess find a more promising\r\nmatch? Was it easy to provide husbands for princesses? Were not they\r\ngenerally extremely unhappy in marriage? What had happened to the\r\nKing's four aunts, all charming princesses, who had married the Duke\r\nof Modena, the Duke of Lucca, the Emperor Ferdinand of Austria, and\r\nthe King of Naples? Had they been happy? Prince Napoleon could not be\r\nso very bad, as he was known to have hurried to Cannes to pay a last\r\nvisit to a woman whom he had loved, a great actress, then upon her\r\ndeathbed. This reminiscence was a singular one to evoke under the\r\ncircumstances, but Cavour was not an Englishman, and he was not\r\nimpressed by the propriety of drawing a veil over facts which everyone\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nThe King's instinct told him that his young daughter, pious and simple\r\nand destitute even of that seasoning of vanity which is so good and\r\nnecessary a thing in a woman, but proud at heart like all her race,\r\nwould derive no compensation from the outward brilliancy of the\r\nImperial Court for the absence of domestic joy which would be her\r\nwedded lot unless a surprising change came over the bridegroom. When,\r\nhowever, he was persuaded of the importance, or rather, of the\r\nessential character of the concession, he said to Cavour: 'I am making\r\na great sacrifice, but I yield to your arguments. Still my consent is\r\nsubordinate to the freely given consent of my daughter.' The matter\r\nwas referred to the Princess, who answered: 'It is the wish of my\r\nfather; therefore this marriage will be useful to my family and my\r\ncountry, and I accept.' An answer worthy of one who, twelve years\r\nlater, when the members of the Imperial House were flying, remained\r\nquietly in Paris, saying: 'Savoy and fear are not acquainted.'\r\n\r\nThe marriage was celebrated at Turin in January. The King made a\r\npresent to Cavour, as a souvenir of the event, of a ring representing\r\ntwo heartseases. In thanking him, the minister said: 'Your Majesty\r\nknows that I shall never marry.' 'I know,' replied the King; 'your\r\nbride is the country.'\r\n\r\nThough warlike rumours circulated off and on, the secret of the\r\nunderstanding arrived at in the Plombières interview was well\r\npreserved, and the words spoken by Napoleon to the Austrian Ambassador\r\nat the New Year's Day reception fell on Europe with the effect of a\r\nbombshell. Turning to Baron Hubner, he said: 'Je regrette que les\r\nrelations entre nous soient si mauvaises; dîtes cependant à votre\r\nsouverain que mes sentiments pour lui ne sont pas changés.'\r\n\r\nEven Cavour was startled. Probably till that moment he had never felt\r\nsure that Napoleon would not after all throw the Italian cause to the\r\nwinds. The Emperor's invariable method in dealing with men was to\r\nmystify them. He was pleased to pose as a faithful ally, but human\r\nintellect was insufficient to fathom what he meant. On this system,\r\nskilfully pursued, was reared the whole fabric of Louis Napoleon's\r\nreputation for being a profound politician. Bearing the fact in mind,\r\nwe can easily see why that reputation crumbled away almost entirely\r\nwhen the present became the past. There are few cases in which there\r\nis more disagreement between the judgment of contemporaries and that\r\nof immediate posterity than the case of the French Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe least surprised, and, among Italians, the most dissatisfied at the\r\nNew Year's Day pronouncement was Mazzini, who when he read it in the\r\n_Times_ next morning felt that the Napoleonic war closed the heroic\r\nperiod of Italian Liberation. To men like Mazzini failure is apt to\r\nseem more heroic than success, and the war of 1859 did close the\r\nperiod of failure. The justification for calling in foreign arms could\r\nonly be in necessity, and Mazzini denied the necessity. Charles Albert\r\ndenied it in 1848 with no less confident a voice. Then, indeed, there\r\ndid appear a chance of Italy making herself, but was there the\r\nslightest prospect, eleven years later, of that chance being repeated?\r\nEach student of history may answer for himself. What is plain is, that\r\nFrance and Sardinia _together_ were to find it an exceedingly hard\r\ntask even to drive the Austrians out of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe unconquerable dislike of men of principle, like Mazzini, to\r\njoining hands with the author of the _coup d'état_ was perfectly\r\nexplicable. There were doubtless some sincere Bulgarian patriots who\r\ndisliked joining hands with the Autocrat of all the Russias. The gift\r\nof freedom from a despot means a long list of evils. Mazzini grasped\r\nthe maleficent influence which Napoleon III. would be in a position to\r\nexercise over the young state; he knew, moreover, when only two or\r\nthree other persons in Europe knew it, that the bargain of Plombières\r\nwas on the principle of give-and-take. How Mazzini was for many years\r\nbetter informed than any cabinet in Europe, remains a secret. 'I know\r\npositively,' he wrote on the 4th of January 1859, 'that the idea of\r\nthe war is only to hand over a zone of Lombardy to Piedmont, and the\r\ncession of Savoy and Nice to France: the peace, upon the offer of\r\nwhich they count, would abandon the whole of Venetia to Austria.' A\r\nmonth before this he had disclosed what was certainly true, namely,\r\nthat Napoleon wanted to place a Murat on the throne of Naples, and to\r\nsubstitute Prince Napoleon for the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The point\r\nthat is doubtful in the above revelation is the statement that the\r\nEmperor never meant to emancipate Venetia. The probabilities are\r\nagainst this. He may, however, have questioned all along whether his\r\ntroops, with those of the King of Sardinia, would display a\r\nsuperiority over the Austrian forces sufficiently incontestable for\r\nhim to risk taking them into the mouse-trap of the Quadrilateral. In\r\nthis one thing Napoleon was amply justified--in having no sort of\r\ndesire to take a beaten army back to Paris.\r\n\r\nMazzini, with the more extreme members of the Party of Action\r\n(including Crispi), issued a protest against the Napoleonic war, with\r\nthe advice to have nothing to do with it or its authors. But Italy\r\nthought otherwise, and Garibaldi, the man who of all others most\r\nnearly represented the heart of Italy, rejoiced and was glad. He did\r\nnot believe a word about the proposed cession of Savoy and Nice; no\r\none did, except Mazzini and his few disciples. What he saw was, that a\r\ngreat step towards independence was about to be taken. In 1856, he not\r\nonly adhered to Manin's call to all Italians to rally round the house\r\nof Savoy, but went further than Manin in accepting unconditionally\r\nwhat he called the 'Savoy Dictatorship,' to which he left full liberty\r\nof choice in the matter of ways and means. He did justice then to\r\nCavour's patriotism: it was only after the sacrifice of Nice that a\r\nfeeling of bitter antagonism grew up in him for the man who he thought\r\nhad deceived Italy and himself. In December 1858, on a summons from\r\nCavour, he left Caprera (the island which he had bought with a little\r\ninheritance falling to him on the death of his brother) and proceeded\r\nto Turin, where he was informed of a plan for a rising in Massa and\r\nCarrara, which was originally intended to be the signal of the war.\r\nThe plan was given up, but in March 1859, Garibaldi was told by Victor\r\nEmmanuel in person of the imminence of war, and was invited to take\r\npart in it as commander of an auxiliary corps of volunteers which took\r\nthe name of 'Cacciatori delle Alpi.' In this way, all his own\r\nfollowers, not only those in arms, but the great mass of the people\r\nwhich was obedient to his lead, became enrolled in the service of the\r\nSardinian monarchy; a fact of capital importance in the future\r\ndevelopment of affairs. Without it, the Italian kingdom could not have\r\nbeen formed. And this fact was due to Cavour, who had to fight the\r\narrayed strength of the old, narrow, military caste at Turin, which\r\nhad succeeded in getting Garibaldi's sword refused in 1848, and wished\r\nfor nothing in the world more than to get it refused in 1859. Near the\r\nend of his life, Cavour said in the Chamber that the difficulties he\r\nencountered in inducing the Sardinian War Office to sanction the\r\nappointment were all but insurmountable. Unfortunately, the jealousy\r\nof the heads of the regular army for the revolutionary captain never\r\nceased. As for Cavour, even when he opposed Garibaldi politically, he\r\nalways strove to have the highest personal honour paid to the man of\r\nwhom he once wrote 'that he had rendered Italy the greatest service\r\nit was possible to render her.'\r\n\r\nTrue to his _rôle_ of mystification, one week after the shot fired on\r\nthe 1st of January, Napoleon inserted an official statement in the\r\n_Moniteur_ to the effect that, although public opinion had been\r\nagitated by alarming rumours, there was nothing in the foreign\r\nrelations of France to justify the fears these rumours tended to\r\ncreate. He continued on this tack, with more or less consistency, to\r\nthe very verge of the outbreak of hostilities. 'The Empire was peace,'\r\nas it was always announced to be in the intervals when it was not war;\r\nthere was no more harmless dove in Europe than the person enthroned in\r\nthe Tuileries. These assurances were given more credence than they\r\ndeserved by the Conservative Cabinet then in power in England, and the\r\nBritish ministers believed to the last that war would be averted, to\r\nwhich end they strained every nerve. Besides the wish felt by every\r\nEnglish government to preserve European peace, there was at this\r\njuncture, not only in the Cabinet, but in the country, so much fear of\r\nNapoleon's ambition and restlessness, that for the time being,\r\nsympathy with Italy was relegated to a second place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was no want of plainness in the language employed in\r\nPiedmont. In opening the second session of the sixth Sardinian\r\nParliament, Victor Emmanuel pronounced, on 10th January, the historic\r\nphrase declaring that he could not remain insensible to the cry of\r\ngrief, _il grido di dolore_, that reached him from all parts of Italy.\r\nEvery corner of the fair country where the _Si_ sounds was electrified.\r\nThe words, as has since become known, were introduced into the speech by\r\nthe King himself. As Cavour had foreseen, Austria played into his hands.\r\nTo Lord Malmesbury's appeal to evacuate the Roman Legations, and to use\r\nAustrian influence with the Italian princes in procuring the concession\r\nof necessary reforms, Count Buol replied in terms that were the reverse\r\nof obliging: 'We do not mean to abdicate our right of intervention, and\r\nif we are called upon to help the Italian sovereigns with our arms, we\r\nshall do so. We shall not recommend their governments to undertake any\r\nreforms. France plays the part of protectress of nationalities; we are,\r\nand shall be, protectors of dynastic rights.' Finally, England proposed\r\na congress with a view to general disarmament. Piedmont, counting on the\r\nmadness of her adversary, risked agreement with this plan. Austria gave\r\na peremptory refusal to have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nCavour now asked Parliament to vote a war loan of £2,000,000, which\r\nwas passed by a majority of 81 out of 151 votes. No foreign banker\r\nwould undertake to negotiate the loan, but it was twice covered by\r\nItalian buyers, nearly all small capitalists, who put their money into\r\nit as a patriotic duty. Amongst the few deputies who opposed the loan\r\nwas the old apostle of retrogression, Count Solaro della Margherita,\r\nwho raised his solitary voice against the tide of revolution; and the\r\nSavoyard the Marquis Costa de Beauregard whose speech was pathetic\r\nfrom the melancholy foreboding which pervaded it that the making\r\nof Italy meant the unmaking of Savoy. Speaking in the name of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, the Marquis reconfirmed the profound love of\r\nSavoy for her Royal House and her total lack of solidarity with the\r\naspirations of Italy. With time the Savoyards might have learnt to be\r\nItalians as their king had learnt to be an Italian king. Or they might\r\nnot. Possibly the best solution would have been to join Savoy to the\r\nSwiss Confederation, though the martial instincts of the race were not\r\nfavourable to their Conversion into peaceful Helvetic citizens. From\r\none point of view, that of military defence, the retention of the\r\nprovince was of infinitely more moment to the future Italy than to\r\nlittle Piedmont. Sardinia could keep the peace with France for an\r\nindefinite period; Italy cannot. What is true of Savoy is far more\r\ntrue of Nice. To have it in foreign keeping is to have a very\r\npartially reformed burglar inside your house.\r\n\r\n'Notre roi,' said an old ragged fisherman of the Lac de Bourget to the\r\nwriter of this book,--'Notre roi nous a vendus.' Not willingly did\r\nVictor Emmanuel incur that charge, in which the rebound from love to\r\nhate was so clearly heard; not willingly did he give up Maurienne,\r\ncradle of his race, Hautecombe, grave of his fathers. It was the\r\ngreatest sacrifice, he said, that Italy could have asked of him. Nor\r\nis there any reason to doubt his word. But it is incorrect to suppose,\r\nas many have supposed, that Cavour promised at Plombières to give up\r\nSavoy (Nice he did not promise) without the King's knowledge. Before\r\nhe went there, he had brought Victor Emmanuel over to his own belief,\r\njustified or not, that without a bait Napoleon could not be got to\r\nmove. Directly after the interview, he wrote a full account of it to\r\nthe King, in which he said: 'When the future fate of Italy was\r\narranged, the Emperor asked me what France would have, and if your\r\nMajesty would cede Savoy and the county of Nice?' To which Cavour\r\nanswered 'Yes' as to Savoy, but objected that Nice was essentially\r\nItalian. The Emperor twirled his moustache several times, and only\r\nsaid that these were secondary questions, about which there would be\r\ntime to think later.\r\n\r\nAustria was always appealing to the right of treaties and the right\r\nof nations; not, as it happened, with much reason, for she had ridden\r\nor tried to ride rough-shod through as many treaties and through quite\r\nas many rights as most European Powers. In 1816 she was so determined\r\nto possess herself of Alessandria and the Upper Novarese that Lord\r\nCastlereagh advised Piedmont to join the Austrian Confederation, as\r\nthen and only then the Emperor might withdraw his pretensions to this\r\nlarge slice of territory of a Prince with whom he was at peace. If he\r\ndid withdraw them, it was not from respect for the treaties which, a\r\nyear before, had confirmed the King of Sardinia's rights as an\r\nindependent sovereign, but from respect for the untoward results to\r\nhimself which he was afraid, on reflection, might arise from enforcing\r\nhis claims with the bayonet. But people forget; and it was of vital\r\nconsequence that virtuous Austria should figure in the coming conflict\r\nnot as the victim of aggression but as the aggressor. On all sides it\r\nwas said that the Austrian Government would never commit an error of\r\nsuch magnitude; only Cavour thought the contrary. 'I shall _force_ her\r\nto declare war against us,' he told Mr Odo Russell in December 1858.\r\nWhen asked by the incredulous diplomatist at what date he expected to\r\nperform so great a feat, Cavour quietly answered: 'In the first week\r\nof May.' War was actually declared a few days sooner.\r\n\r\nFor months Austria had been pouring troops into Italy, a large portion\r\nof which were massed on the frontier line of the Ticino. Who shall\r\ncount the number of the men brought to fight and die in the Italian\r\nplains between 1848 and 1866 to sustain for that short time the weight\r\nof a condemned despotism? The supply was inexhaustible; they came from\r\nthe Hungarian steppes, from the green valleys of Styria, from the\r\nmountains of Tyrol, from the woodlands of the Banat and of Bohemia; a\r\nblind million battling for a chimera. They came, and how many did not\r\nreturn?\r\n\r\nAustria's final refusal to adhere to the Congress scheme meant, of\r\ncourse, war, and Cavour called the Chamber and demanded a vote\r\nconferring upon Government the power to take such prompt measures as\r\nthe situation required. 'We trust,' he said, 'that the Chamber will\r\nnot hesitate to sanction the proposal to invest the King with plenary\r\npowers. Who could be a better guardian of our liberty? Who more worthy\r\nof the faith of the nation? He it is whose name a ten years' reign had\r\nmade synonymous with honour and loyalty; who has always held high the\r\ntricolor standard of Italy, who now prepares to unsheath his sword for\r\nfreedom and independence.'\r\n\r\nWhen Cavour walked out of the Chamber after the vote had been taken,\r\nhe said: 'I am leaving the last sitting of the Piedmontese Parliament,\r\nthe next will be that of the Kingdom of Italy.' At that moment, if\r\never in his career, the great minister who had fought so long a fight\r\nagainst incalculable obstacles learnt what it is to taste the\r\nsweetness of triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR LOMBARDY\r\n\r\n1859\r\n\r\nAustria declares War--Montebello--Garibaldi's\r\nCampaign--Palestro--Magenta--The Allies enter Milan--Ricasoli saves\r\nItalian Unity--Accession of Francis II.--Solferino--The Armistice of\r\nVillafranca.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaron von Kellersperg reached Turin on the 23rd of April, bringing\r\nwith him the Austrian ultimatum: 'Disarmament within three days, or\r\nwar.' Cavour read the document, and then drew his watch out of his\r\npocket. It was half-past five in the afternoon. At the same hour on\r\nthe 26th, he gave Baron von Kellersperg the answer: 'Sardinia having\r\naccepted the principle of a general disarmament, as formulated by\r\nEngland, with the adhesion of France, Prussia and Russia, the\r\nSardinian Government has no other explanation to make.' The retort was\r\njustified. Austria, which now required Sardinia to disarm, had refused\r\nto disarm herself. She must take the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe British Government made a last desperate effort to maintain peace,\r\nand the Austrians always said that this was their ruin, as it delayed\r\nthe invasion of Piedmont for a week. On the 29th appeared the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph's Declaration of War, and on the same day the first\r\nAustrian columns crossed the Ticino. The Austrian commander-in-chief\r\nwas Count Gyulai, who was in high favour with the aristocratic party,\r\nby which his appointment was suggested to, if not forced upon, the\r\nEmperor. The latter, not altogether easy in his mind about Gyulai's\r\ncapabilities, commissioned General Hess, in whom he placed full\r\nconfidence, to keep his eye on him. Hess could not, however, do much\r\nmore than take notes of one of the most remarkable and providential\r\nseries of blunders ever committed by the commander of an army.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the delay which the Austrians ascribed to the English\r\npeace negotiations, there was time for them to destroy the Sardinian\r\narmy before the French came up. Gyulai had 100,000 men in the theatre\r\nof war, a number increased up to 200,000 during the campaign. Both\r\nSardinia and her ally mustered much fewer men than were spoken of at\r\nPlombières. The Piedmontese could dispose of 56,000 infantry, formed\r\nin five divisions, one division of cavalry numbering 4,000, and one\r\nbrigade of volunteers, to which the name was given of 'Cacciatori\r\ndelle Alpi.' The enrolment of these was stopped when it had reached\r\nthe small figure of 4,500 men, a figure that looks out of all\r\nproportion with the brilliant part they played. The same influences\r\nwhich cut short the enrolment prevented Cavour from keeping his\r\ndistinct promise to give Garibaldi, now invested with the official\r\nrank of major-general, 10,000 regulars, with a battery and a troop of\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThe French army consisted of 128,000 men, including about 10,000\r\ncavalry. The Emperor's Government had notified beforehand to Vienna\r\nthat the passage of the Ticino by the Austrian troops would be\r\nconsidered equivalent to a declaration of war, and accordingly, on the\r\n29th of April, diplomatic relations between the two Powers were broken\r\noff. The French forces had been really on the move for more than a\r\nweek--ever since, in fact, by what the Marquis of Normanby called 'an\r\nunpardonable breach of confidence,' the intention of Austria to invade\r\nSardinia was communicated to Paris. The mobilisation was conducted\r\nwith rapidity; in spite of the snow, which lay deep on the Mont Cenis,\r\nthe first corps, under Marshal Baraguay d'Hilliers, made a swift march\r\nover the Alps, and the foremost division entered Turin on the 30th of\r\nApril. The troops of Canrobert and Niel, who commanded the third and\r\nfourth corps, were sent by Toulon and Marseilles, while the generals\r\nthemselves went on to Turin in advance. MacMahon's corps, which was\r\nthe second, was on its way from Algiers. The fifth corps, under the\r\ncommand of Prince Napoleon, was despatched at a later date to Tuscany,\r\nwhere it was kept in a state of inactivity, which suggested rather a\r\npolitical than a military mission. General Regnault de Saint-Jean\r\nd'Angély commanded the Imperial Guard. Napoleon III assumed the\r\nsupreme command of the allied armies, with General Vaillant as head of\r\nthe staff.\r\n\r\nThe condition of neither French nor Austrian army was satisfactory.\r\nThe former had more modern arms and a greater proportion of old\r\nsoldiers, but it was generally thought that the French cavalry, so far\r\nsuperior to the Prussian in the war of 1870, was inferior to the\r\nAustrian in 1859. The commissariat and ambulance arrangements of the\r\nFrench were disgraceful, though they had this advantage, that when\r\nthere was food to be had the soldiers were allowed to eat it, while\r\nthe Austrians were limited to half-a-pound of beef a day, and were\r\nonly allowed to cook once in the twenty-four hours, which led to their\r\nhaving constantly to fight fasting. In point of discipline, they were\r\nprobably superior to the French, who fought, however, and this should\r\nalways be remembered of them in Italy, with the best will in the\r\nworld. They carried about their pet monkeys and dogs, and were always\r\ngood-humoured and in good spirits, even when wounded. What would have\r\nbeen the effect on them of even a single defeat is a question which it\r\nis useless to discuss.\r\n\r\nIn Napoleon's proclamation to the French people it was stated that the\r\nscope of the war was to give Italy to herself, not to make her change\r\nmasters; the recompense of France would be to have upon her frontiers\r\na friendly people which owed its independence to her. As things stood\r\nthere were but two alternatives: Austria supreme as far as the Alps,\r\nor Italy free to the Adriatic. On the 12th of May, the Imperial yacht,\r\nthe _Reine Hortense_, steamed into the harbour of Genoa with the\r\nEmperor on board. A splendid reception awaited him, and amongst the\r\nfirst to greet him was Cavour. 'You may well rejoice,' said Napoleon,\r\nas he embraced the Sardinian statesman, 'for your plans are being\r\nrealised.'\r\n\r\nGyulai, who had insisted on invading Piedmont, contrary to the opinion\r\nof Hess (who counselled waiting for reinforcements on the left bank of\r\nthe Mincio), wasted his time after crossing the Ticino in making plans\r\nand changing them while he could unquestionably have thrown himself on\r\nTurin had he possessed more resolution, and this was the only\r\noperation that could have justified the initial folly of the invasion.\r\nThe taking of the capital might not have altered the fortunes of the\r\nwar, but it would have had all the appearance of a triumph, and would\r\nhave raised the _moral_ of the Austrian soldiers. The allies had time\r\nto concentrate their forces near Tortona, and it was left to them to\r\nassume the offensive. The Austrians retired towards the Apennines, but\r\nmade a forward movement on the 20th of May with the object of seizing\r\nthe heights of Casteggio which command the road to Piacenza; they were\r\nmet by the allies at the village of Montebello where Marshal Lannes\r\nobtained a victory in 1800. The allies were completely successful in\r\nthis first battle, the honours of the day falling to the Sardinian\r\ncavalry, which showed great gallantry. The Austrian forces were\r\nconsiderably superior in strength.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time as the engagement of Montebello, Garibaldi\r\nwith his diminutive army (which through the weeding-out of men unfit\r\nfor service was reduced to about 3,500 before it took the field),\r\ncrossed the Lago Maggiore, and advanced boldly into the heart of the\r\nenemy's country. The volunteers had no artillery, and by way of\r\ncavalry only some forty or fifty were mounted on their own horses and\r\ndignified with the name of 'guides.' They were badly armed and worse\r\nequipped; the only good thing they had was an excellent ambulance\r\norganised by Dr Bertani, Garibaldi's surgeon-general from Roman days\r\ndownwards. But they formed a picturesque sight as they marched along\r\ngaily to the everlasting song, 'Addio, mia bella, addio'; and a\r\nphysiognomist would have been struck by their intelligent and often\r\ndistinguished faces: nobles and poets, budding doctors and lawyers,\r\nbristled in the ranks, while the officers were the still young\r\nveterans of 1848-1849: Cosenz, hero of Venice; Medici, the defender of\r\nthe Vascello; Bixio, Sirtori, Cairoli--all the Knights of the Legend.\r\n\r\nMoving swiftly from place to place, and appearing where and when he\r\nwas least expected, Garibaldi took the entire country of the Lombard\r\nlakes. Gyulai, who at first looked upon the Garibaldian march as a\r\nsimple diversion intended to draw off his attention, now became\r\nconcerned, and dispatched Urban with 10,000 men to destroy the\r\nvolunteers, and stem the insurrection which everywhere followed in\r\ntheir wake. On the 27th of May Garibaldi drove Urban from his position\r\nnear San Fermo, and that commander had his mission still unfulfilled\r\nwhen he received the order to retreat after the battle of Magenta. The\r\nvolunteers were free to pursue their way to Brescia and the\r\nValtellina, where they performed many feats in the latter period of\r\nthe war, winning the admiration of Hayn, the Austrian general opposed\r\nto them, which he was generous enough to express in no measured terms.\r\n\r\nThe great war was meanwhile approaching its climax. After Montebello\r\nthe whole French army executed a secret flank movement, changing its\r\nposition from Voghera, where Gyulai believed it to be, and whence he\r\nexpected it to move on to Piacenza, to the line of the Sesia, between\r\nCameriano and Casale. To mask the main operations, the Sardinian\r\nforces were sent to Palestro, on the other side of the Sesia. On the\r\n30th of May, they drove in the outposts of the enemy, and on the 31st\r\nfought the important engagement by which the Austrian attempt to\r\nretake Palestro was repelled, and great damage caused to Zobel's\r\ncorps, which was obliged to leave eight guns sticking in the mud. The\r\nFrench Zouaves of the 3rd regiment fought with the Piedmontese, and\r\nmade the battle famous by the reckless valour of their bayonet\r\ncharges. Victor Emmanuel, deaf to all remonstrances, placed himself at\r\ntheir head, in consequence of which they elected him their corporal,\r\nan honour once paid to the first Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that after Palestro, Gyulai, having at last\r\nrealised what Napoleon was about, wished to evacuate Lombardy, but was\r\nprevented from doing so by strong protests sent by the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph, who was at Verona. The Austrian army was in full retreat when\r\nit was pulled up near Magenta, with the object of checking the advance\r\nof the French, who had already begun to cross the Ticino by the\r\nbridges of San Martino and Buffalora, which the Austrians had tried to\r\nblow up, but had not succeeded from want of proper powder. In the\r\ngreat battle of the 4th of June, Austrians and French numbered\r\nrespectively about 60,000 men; no Piedmontese were engaged till the\r\nevening, when a battalion of Bersaglieri arrived. The Imperial Guard,\r\nwith which was Napoleon, had to bear the brunt of the fight for four\r\nhours, and ran a good chance of being annihilated; not a brilliant\r\nproof of French generalship, but happily the Austrians also committed\r\ngrave mistakes. MacMahon's arrival at five in the afternoon prevented\r\na catastrophe, and the fighting, which continued far into the night,\r\nwas from this moment attended by results on the whole advantageous to\r\nthe French. Not much more can be said. Magenta was very like a drawn\r\nbattle. The Austrians are calculated to have lost 10,000 men, the\r\nFrench between 4,000 and 5,000. It was expected that the Austrians\r\nwould renew the attack, but on the 5th, Gyulai ordered the retreat,\r\nwhich was the last order he had the opportunity of giving, as he was\r\ndeprived of his command immediately after.\r\n\r\nAt mid-day on the 5th, Milan, which was trembling on the verge of\r\nrevolution, made the pleasurable discovery that there were no\r\nAustrians left in the town. The municipality sent out delegates with\r\nthe keys of the city to Victor Emmanuel. At ten a.m. on the 7th,\r\nMacMahon's corps began to file down the streets. Words cannot describe\r\nthe welcome given to them. How MacMahon lifted to his saddle-bow a\r\nchild that was in danger of being crushed by the crowd will be\r\nremembered from the pretty incident having passed into English poetry.\r\nOn the 8th, the King and the Emperor made their entry amidst a new\r\nparoxysm of enthusiasm. Napoleon is reported to have exclaimed: 'How\r\nthis people must have suffered!' In his proclamation 'to the Italian\r\npeople,' which bears the same date as his entry into Milan, he renewed\r\nthe assurance of the disinterested motives which had brought him to\r\nItaly: 'Your enemies, who are also mine, have endeavoured to diminish\r\nthe universal sympathy felt in Europe for your cause, by causing it to\r\nbe believed that I am making war for personal ambition, or to\r\nincrease French territory. If there are men who fail to comprehend\r\ntheir epoch, I am not one of them. In the enlightened state of public\r\nopinion now prevailing, true greatness lies in the moral influence\r\nwhich we exercise rather than in sterile conquests.' The proclamation\r\nended with the words: 'To-morrow you will be the citizens of a great\r\ncountry.' Not the least effusive demonstrations were reserved for\r\nCavour, who joined his Sovereign a few days after the battle of\r\nMagenta.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving the Milanese to put their faith in princes while yet there was\r\ntime, a glance must be taken at what had been going on in the rest of\r\nItaly, which was becoming a great nation far more rapidly, and in a\r\nmuch fuller sense than Napoleon III. expected or wished. When Austria\r\nsent her ultimatum to Turin, the Sardinian minister at the Court of\r\nTuscany invited the Grand Duke's Government to take part in the war of\r\nliberation. This they refused to do. On perceiving, however, that he\r\ncould not depend on his troops, the Grand Duke promised to co-operate\r\nwith Piedmont, but his advisers did not now think it possible to save\r\nthe grand ducal throne, unless Leopold II. abdicated in favour of his\r\nson, who was not burdened with the fatal associations of the reaction\r\nof ten years before. Leopold probably thought that even his abdication\r\nwould not keep out the deluge, and he took the more dignified course\r\nof declining to yield to force. On the 27th of April, accompanied by\r\nthe Corps Diplomatique as far as the frontier, he left Tuscany. A\r\nProvisional Government was formed with Peruzzi at its head, which\r\nhastily raised 8000 men for immediate service under the command of\r\nGeneral Ulloa. Before long Prince Napoleon, with the fifth corps of\r\nthe French army, landed, for no reason that could be avowed, at\r\nLeghorn. The real motive was to prepare the way for the fabrication\r\nof a new kingdom of Etruria, which existed already in Napoleon's\r\nbrain. This masterpiece of folly had but a lukewarm supporter in\r\nPrince Napoleon, who was the only Napoleon and about the only\r\nFrenchman (if he could be called one) who grasped the idea of the\r\nunity of Italy and sincerely applauded it. Had Jérôme Napoleon been\r\nborn with the least comprehension of self-respect and personal\r\ndignity, his strong political intelligence and clear logical\r\ndiscernment must have produced something better than the most\r\nineffectual career of the century.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, Baron Ricasoli took office under the Provisional\r\nGovernment as Minister of the Interior, and for nearly twelve months\r\nhe was the real ruler of Tuscany. He had an ally of great strength,\r\nthough of humble origin, in Giuseppe Dolfi, the baker, of whom it was\r\ncurrently said that any day he could summon 10,000 men to the Piazza\r\ndella Signoria, who would obey him to the death. To Dolfi it was due\r\nthat there were no disorders after the Grand Duke left. What Italy\r\nowes to the Lord of Brolio, history will never adequately state,\r\nbecause it is well-nigh impossible fully to realise how critical was\r\nher position during all that year, from causes external and internal,\r\nand how disastrous would have been the slightest mistake or wavering\r\nin the direction of Tuscan affairs, which formed the central hinge of\r\nthe whole complicated situation. Fortunate, indeed, was it that there\r\nwas a man like the Iron Baron, who, by simple force of will, outwitted\r\nthe enemies of Italy more thoroughly than even Cavour could do with\r\nall his astuteness. Austere, aristocratic, immovable from his purpose,\r\nindifferent to praise or blame, Ricasoli aimed at one point--the\r\nunity of the whole country; and neither Cavour's impatience for\r\nannexation to Piedmont, nor the scheme of Farini and Minghetti for\r\naverting the wrath of the French Emperor by a temporary and\r\npreparatory union of the central states, drew him one inch from the\r\nstraight road, which was the only one he had ever learnt to walk in.\r\n\r\nIn June, the Duke of Modena and the Duchess-Regent of Parma found it\r\nimpossible to remain in their states, now that Austrian protection was\r\nwithdrawn. The latter had done what she could to preserve the duchy\r\nfor her young son, but the tide was too strong. These revolutions were\r\naccomplished quietly; but, some months after, on the incautious return\r\nto Parma of a man deeply implicated in the abuses of Charles III.'s\r\ngovernment--Colonel Anviti--he was cruelly murdered; an act of\r\nvengeance which happily remained alone.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Magenta, when the Austrian troops were recalled\r\nfrom the Marches and Romagna, those districts rose and demanded the\r\ndictatorship of Piedmont. Napoleon foresaw that this would happen as\r\nfar back as the Plombières interview, and at that date it did not\r\nappear that he meant to oppose it. But now, in Paris, the Clerical\r\nparty were seized with panic, and the Empress-Regent, then, as always,\r\ncompletely under their control, did all in her power to arouse the\r\nEmperor's opposition. The Pope, on his part, knowing that he was\r\nsecure in Rome--thanks to the French garrison, which, though it hated\r\nits office, as the French writer Ampère and others bore witness, was\r\nsure to perform it faithfully--had the idea of sending his Swiss\r\ntroops to put down the growing revolution. With these, and a few Roman\r\ntroops of the line, Colonel Schmidt marched against Perugia, where, in\r\nrestoring the Papal authority, he used a ferocity which, though denied\r\nby clerical writers, was attested by all contemporary accounts, and\r\nwas called 'atrocious' by Sir James Hudson in a despatch to Lord John\r\nRussell. The significance of such facts, wrote the English minister at\r\nTurin, could only be the coming fall of the Pope's Temporal Power.\r\n\r\nL.C. Farini was sent by Victor Emmanuel to administer the provinces of\r\nModena and Parma, and Massimo d'Azeglio was charged with the same\r\nmission in Romagna. The Marches of Ancona had been recovered by the\r\nPapal troops, which were concentrated in the district called La\r\nCattolica, near Rimini. A volunteer corps, under the Piedmontese\r\nGeneral Mezzacapo, was entrusted with the task of preventing them from\r\ncrossing into the Legations.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, when the allies were reaping their first\r\nsuccesses, an event occurred at Caserta which precipitated crisis in\r\nthe South Italy. Ferdinand II. died at forty-eight years of age of a\r\nterrible complaint which had attacked him a few months earlier, when\r\nhe went to meet his son's bride, the Princess Maria Sofia of Bavaria,\r\nsister of the Empress of Austria. The news from Upper Italy hastened\r\nhis end; he is said to have exclaimed not long before he died: 'They\r\nhave won the cause!'\r\n\r\nThe accession of a youth, of whom nothing bad was known, to a throne\r\nthat had been occupied by a sovereign so out of place in modern\r\ncivilisation as Ferdinand, would appear at first sight a fortunate\r\ncircumstance for the chances of the dynasty; but it was not so. In an\r\neastern country it matters little whether the best of the inhabitants\r\nloathe and detest their ruler; but it matters much whether he knows\r\nhow to cajole and frighten the masses, and especially the army, into\r\nobedience. Naples, more Oriental than western, possessed in Ferdinand\r\na monarch consummately expert in this side of the art of government.\r\nThough without the higher military virtues, his army was his favourite\r\nplaything; he always wore uniform, never forgot a face he had once\r\nseen, and treated the officers with a rather vulgar familiarity,\r\nguessing at their weaknesses and making use of them on occasion. The\r\nrank and file regarded him as a sort of supernatural being. Francis\r\nII., who succeeded him, could scarcely appear in this light even to\r\nthe most ignorant. Popular opinion considered him not quite sound in\r\nhis mind. Probably his timorous, awkward ways and his seeming\r\nstupidity were simply the result of an education conducted by bigoted\r\npriests in a home that was no home: populated as it was by the\r\noffspring of a stepmother who hated him. His own mother, the charming\r\nPrincess Cristina of Savoy, died while the city was rejoicing at his\r\nbirth. The story is well known of how, shortly after the marriage,\r\nFerdinand thought it diverting to draw a music-stool from under his\r\nwife, causing her to fall heavily. It gives a sample of the sufferings\r\nof her brief married life. An inheritance of sorrow descended from her\r\nto her child.\r\n\r\nIf Francis II. was not popular, neither was the new queen. Far more\r\nvirile in character and in tastes than her husband, her high spirit\r\nwas not what the Neapolitans admire in women, and those who were\r\ndevoted to the late King accused her of having shown impatience during\r\nhis illness for the moment when the crown would fall to Francis.\r\nMalicious gossip of this kind, however false, serves its end. Thus,\r\nfrom one cause or another, the young King exercised a power sensibly\r\nweaker than that of his father, while, besides other enemies, he had\r\nan inveterate one in his stepmother, who began weaving a conspiracy to\r\noust him from the throne and place on it the eldest of his\r\nhalf-brothers. This plot received, however, very little popular\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe Sardinian Government sought to persuade Francis to join in the\r\nwar against Austria; disinterested counsel, as in taking it lay his\r\nonly hope, but it was opposed by England, Russia and France. In July\r\ntwo of the Swiss regiments at Naples mutinied. The Swiss Government,\r\nbecoming alive to the discredit cast on the country by mercenary\r\nservice, had decided that Swiss subjects serving abroad should lose\r\ntheir rights as citizens of the Confederation whilst so employed, and\r\nthat they should no longer introduce the arms of their respective\r\ncantons into their regimental colours. This was the immediate cause of\r\ntheir insubordination. The mutineers, most of whom were unarmed, were\r\nruthlessly shot down in the Campo di Marte to the terror of the\r\npopulation, and the two Swiss regiments which remained quiet were\r\ndissolved; by which the monarchy lost the troops that were chiefly to\r\nbe depended on in emergencies. The Austrians and Bavarians imported in\r\ntheir stead did not form separate regiments, but were incorporated\r\namong the native troops, though the regiments that contained them were\r\ncommonly called 'Bavarian.' They only partially filled the place of\r\nthe Swiss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween the 4th and the 24th of June, no engagement of any magnitude\r\nwas fought in Lombardy except the attack on Benedek at Melegnano, a\r\nbattle in which the French lost most men, and gained no strategical\r\nadvantage. It was supposed to have been fought because Napoleon I. had\r\ngained a victory in the same neighbourhood. The Austrians retreated to\r\nthe Mincio, destroying the bridges over the Adda, Serio, Oglio and\r\nMella as they went; these rivers the allies had to make repassable,\r\nwhich is the excuse given for the dilatory nature of their pursuit of\r\nthe enemy. The Emperor Francis Joseph had now assumed the command,\r\nwith Hess as his principle adviser, and Wimpffen and Schlick, famous\r\nas the 'One-eyed,' as heads of the two great corps into which the army\r\nwas divided.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June, the Austrians were ranged along the left bank of\r\nthe Mincio from Peschiera to Mantua, and the French were massed near\r\nMontechiaro, on the Brescia road, which Napoleon had made his\r\nheadquarters. In withdrawing all their men from the right bank of the\r\nriver, the Austrians desired to create the impression that they had\r\nfinally abandoned it. It was their plan, which did not lack boldness,\r\nto throw the whole army back upon the right bank, and to perform a\r\nconcentric movement on Montechiaro, where they hoped to fall unawares\r\non the French and destroy them. They were confident of success, for\r\nthey knew what a good stand they had made at Magenta, and now that\r\nGyulai was got rid of, and the young Emperor had taken the field, they\r\ndid not doubt that fortune would turn her wheel. To these men of many\r\nnations, the presence of their Emperor was the one inspiration that\r\ncould rouse them, for if they were fighting for anything, it was for\r\nhim in the most personal sense; it was to secure his mastery of the\r\nsplendid land over which he looked from the castle of Valleggio, on\r\nthe 23rd of June, whilst his brilliant staff stood round, waiting for\r\nthe signal to mount and clatter down the steep road to the Mincio\r\nbridge. The army now advanced along all its line.\r\n\r\nEven the soberest writers have not resisted making some reference to\r\nthe magnificent scene of to-morrow's battle. On one side, the mountain\r\nbulwarks rising tier on tier, gorgeous with the trancendent beauty of\r\ncolour and light of the Italian summer; on the other, the vine-clad\r\nhillocks which fall gently away from the blue lake of Garda till they\r\nare lost in the\r\n\r\n  ............harvest shining plain\r\n  Where the peasant heaps his grain\r\n  In the garner of his foe.\r\n\r\nThe 24th of June was to decide how much longer the Lombard peasant\r\nshould labour to fill a stranger's treasury.\r\n\r\nThe calculations of the Austrians were founded on the slowness which\r\nhad hitherto characterised Napoleon's movements. Hess thought that two\r\ndays might be safely allowed for the Austrian advance, and that the\r\nenemy would remain passive on the west bank of the river Chiese,\r\nwaiting to be attacked on the 25th. If the operation could have been\r\nperformed in one day, and it is thought that it could, there would\r\nhave been more prospect of success. But even then, the original plan\r\nof attacking the allies west of the Chiese could not have been carried\r\nout, as on the 23rd the whole allied army moved forward, the French\r\noccupying Castiglione and Lonato, and the Sardinians Rezzato and\r\nDesenzano, on the lake of Garda. It is not clear how far the allies\r\nbelieved in the Austrian advance; that they had warning of it from\r\nseveral quarters is certain. For instance, a gentleman living at\r\nDesenzano heard from the country people, who, for marketing or other\r\npurposes, constantly go to and fro between that place and Peschiera,\r\nthat the Austrians had ordered a quantity of country carts and\r\ntransport waggons to be in readiness on the 23rd, and he hastened with\r\nthe intelligence to the Piedmontese General Delia Rocca, who, in a\r\nfine spirit of red-tapism, pooh-poohed the information. The French\r\nencountered several Austrian patrols in the course of the day, but\r\nthey were inclined to think that the Austrians were only executing a\r\nreconnaissance. On the whole, it seems that the conflict came as a\r\nsurprise to both sides.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Austria, after accompanying the advance for a short\r\ndistance, returned with Hess to Valleggio for the night. Napoleon\r\nslept at Montechiaro. The Austrian forces bivouacked on the little\r\nhills between Solferino and Cavriana. They rested well, still\r\nconfident that no fighting would be done next day. At two in the\r\nmorning, the French began to move in the direction of Solferino, and\r\nthe Sardinians in that of Peschiera. There is a legend, that in the\r\ngrey mists of dawn an advance party of French cavalry espied a huge\r\nand gaunt hussar standing by the roadside. For a moment the figure was\r\nlost sight of, but it reappeared, and after running across the road in\r\nfront of the French, it turned and dealt the officer who led the party\r\nso tremendous a blow that he fell off his horse. Then the adventurous\r\nAustrian fled, followed by a volley from the French troopers; the\r\nsound vibrating through the dawn stillness gave the call to arms to\r\nthe contrasted hosts. The battle of Solferino had begun.\r\n\r\nThe news flew to Montechiaro and to Valleggio. Napoleon started for\r\nthe scene of action with the Imperial Guard; Francis Joseph's staff\r\nwas sent forward at six a.m., but the Emperor and Hess did not start\r\ntill later. At near nine, the staff was looking for the Emperor, and\r\nthe Emperor was looking for the staff in the open country about Volta;\r\nthe sixty or seventy staff-officers dashed across ploughed fields and\r\nover hedges and ditches, in a style which would have done credit to an\r\nEnglish fox-hunt. This remarkable incident was in keeping with the\r\ngeneral management of the battle on the part of the Austrians, who had\r\nbeen fighting for many hours before the commander-in-chief arrived.\r\nAfter his arrival, they continued fighting without any visible plan,\r\naccording to the expedients of the divisional generals. The particular\r\nexpedient adopted by General Zedwitz was to withdraw 15,000 men,\r\nincluding six regiments of cavalry, from the field. At a critical\r\nmoment, Count Clam Gallas had the misfortune to lose his artillery\r\nreserve, and sent everywhere to ask if anyone had seen it. The Prince\r\nof Hesse, acting without orders, or against orders, separated his\r\ndivision from Schwarzenberg's and brought it up at the nick of time to\r\nsave the Austrians, when they were threatened with actual destruction,\r\nat two o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nAt that hour the French were in possession of the Spia d'Italia, and\r\nof all the heights of Solferino. They had been engaged in attacking\r\nthem since eight in the morning, Napoleon having seen at once that\r\nthey were the key to the position, and must be taken, cost what it\r\nmight. The cost was great; if there is any episode in French military\r\nhistory in which soldiers and officers earned all the praise that can\r\nbe given to brave men, it is the taking of these Solferino hills.\r\nAgain and again Forey's division and Bazaine's brigade returned to the\r\ncharge; the cemetery and streets of Solferino were piled up with their\r\ndead, mingled with the dead of the defenders, who contested every inch\r\nof ground. The individual valour of the French soldiers in that six\r\nhours' struggle made it possible to win the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, however, after their desperate straits at two o'clock\r\nrecovered to so great an extent that, had Zedwitz returned with his\r\ncavalry, as the Emperor was hoping that he would, the day might still\r\nhave been theirs. Even as it was, MacMahon's corps swerved under\r\nZobel's repulse of his attack on San Cassiano, and Niel, in the plain,\r\nwas dangerously hard pressed by Schwarzenberg. But, by degrees, the\r\nFrench recommenced gaining and the Austrians losing ground, and at six\r\np.m., the latter were retreating in good order, defending each step\r\nbefore they yielded it.\r\n\r\nIn the last stage of the battle the French limbered up their guns in\r\nthe belief that a vast reserve of Austrian cavalry was galloping into\r\naction. What made them think so was a dense yellowish wall advancing\r\nthrough the air. Had they been natives, they would have recognised the\r\napproach of one of those frightful storms which bring devastation in\r\ntheir train, and which, as they move forward in what appears a solid\r\nmass, look to the inexperienced eye exactly like the clouds of dust\r\nraised by innumerable horsemen. The bursting of the storm hastened the\r\nend of the fight.\r\n\r\nAll the day another fight, separate from this, had been going on\r\nbetween Benedek and the Sardinian army near the knoll of San Martino,\r\noverlooking the lake of Garda. The battle, which began in the early\r\nmorning among the cypresses that crown the hillock, raged till seven\r\np.m. with a fury which cost the Piedmontese over 4,000 in dead and\r\nwounded. It consisted largely in hand-to-hand fighting, which now gave\r\nan advantage to the Austrians, now to the Italians; many of the\r\npositions were lost and re-taken more than half-a-dozen times; the\r\nissue seemed long doubtful, and when Benedek, who commanded his side\r\nwith unquestionable ability, received orders from the field of\r\nSolferino to begin a retreat, each combatant was firmly convinced that\r\nhe was getting the best of it. Austrian writers allege that this order\r\nsaved the Sardinians from defeat, while in both Italian and French\r\nnarratives, the Piedmontese are represented as having been already\r\nsure of success. The courage shown alike by Piedmontese and Austrians\r\ncould not be surpassed. Victor Emmanuel, as usual, set an example to\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\nAn incident in the battle brings into striking relief what it was this\r\nbloody strife was meant to end. An Austrian corporal fell, mortally\r\nwounded by a Bersagliere whom he conjured, in Italian, to listen to\r\nwhat he had got to say. It was this: Forced into the Austrian army, he\r\nhad been obliged to serve through the war, but had never fired his\r\nrifle on his fellow-countrymen; now he preferred to die rather than\r\ndefend himself. So he yielded up his breath with his hand clasped in\r\nthe hand which had slain him.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians lost, on the 24th of June, 13,000 men in killed and\r\nwounded; the French, 10,000. It was said that the frightful scene of\r\ncarnage on the battlefield after Solferino influenced Napoleon III. in\r\nhis desire to stop the war. Had that scene vanished from his\r\nrecollection in June 1870?\r\n\r\nEven a field of battle, with its unburied dead, speaks only of a small\r\npart of the miseries of a great war. Those who were at that time at\r\nBrescia, to which town the greater portion of the French wounded and\r\nall the worst cases were brought, still shudder as they recall the\r\ndreadful human suffering which no skill or devotion could do more than\r\na very little to assuage. The noble Brescian ladies who had once\r\nnursed Bayard, turned, with one accord, into sisters of charity; every\r\nhouse, every church, became a hospital, all that gratitude and pity\r\ncould do was done; but many were to leave their bones in Italy, and\r\nhow many more to go home maimed for life, or bearing with them the\r\nseeds of death.\r\n\r\nOther reasons than those of sentiment in reality decided Napoleon's\r\ncourse. Though these can only be guessed at, the guess, at the present\r\ndate, amounts to certainty. In the first place, the skin-deep\r\nrejoicings in Paris at the news of the victories did not hide the fact\r\nthat French public opinion, never genuinely favourable to the war, was\r\nbecoming more and more hostile to it. Then there was the military\r\nquestion. It is true that the Fifth Corps, estimated at 30,000 men,\r\nhad, at last, emerged from its crepuscular doings in Tuscany, and was\r\navailable for future operations. Moreover, Kossuth paid a visit to the\r\nImperial headquarters, and held out hopes of a revolution in Hungary\r\nwhich would oblige the Austrian Emperor to remove part of his troops\r\nfrom the scene of the war. Nevertheless, Napoleon was by no means\r\nconvinced that his army was sufficient to take the Quadrilateral. He\r\nrealised the bad organisation and numerous shortcomings of the forces\r\nunder him so vividly that it seems incredible that, in the eleven\r\nfollowing years, he should have done nothing to remedy them. He\r\nattributed his success mainly to chance, though in a less degree to a\r\ncertain lack of energy in the Austrians, joined with the exaggerated\r\nfear of responsibility felt by their leaders. He never could\r\nthoroughly understand why the Austrians had not won Solferino.\r\nNaturally, he did not express these opinions to his marshals, but\r\nthere is ample proof that he held them; and if the fact stood alone,\r\nit ought not to be difficult to explain why he was not anxious for a\r\ncontinuance of the war.\r\n\r\nBut it does not stand alone. Napoleon feared being defeated on the\r\nRhine as well as in the Quadrilateral. Prussia had six army corps\r\nready, and she was about to move them. That, after her long\r\nhesitations, she resolved to intervene was long doubted, but it\r\ncannot be so after the evidence which recent years have produced.\r\n\r\nAt the time things wore a different complexion. Europe was never more\r\namazed than when, on the 6th of July, Napoleon the victor sent General\r\nFleury to Francis Joseph the vanquished with a request for an\r\narmistice. One point only was plain; an armistice meant peace without\r\nVenetia, and never did profound sorrow so quickly succeed national joy\r\nthan when this, to contemporaries astonishing intelligence, went\r\nforth. But the blow fell on no Italian with such tremendous force as\r\non Cavour.\r\n\r\nThere are natives of Italy who appear to be more cool, more\r\ncalculating, more completely masters of themselves, than the men of\r\nany other nationality. Cavour was one of these. But there comes,\r\nsooner or later, the assertion of southern blood, the explosion of\r\nfeeling the more violent because long contained, and the cool, quiet\r\nItalian of yesterday is not to be recognised except by those who know\r\nthe race intimately well, and who know the volcano that underlies its\r\nice and snow as well as its luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 6th of June, the French army was spread out in\r\nbattle array along the left bank of the Mincio, and everything led to\r\nthe supposition that a new and immediate battle was in contemplation.\r\nThe Piedmontese were engaged in making preparations to invest\r\nPeschiera. Napoleon's headquarters were at Valleggio, those of the\r\nKing at Monzambano. By the evening a very few persons had picked up\r\nthe information that Napoleon had sent a messenger to Verona. Victor\r\nEmmanuel knew nothing of it, nor did any of the French generals except\r\nMarshal Vaillant, but such things leak out, and two or three\r\nindividuals were aware of the journey to Verona, and spent that night\r\nin racking their brains as to what it might mean. Next day at eleven\r\no'clock General Fleury returned; the Austrian Emperor had accepted the\r\narmistice. Further secrecy was impossible, and like lightning the news\r\nflashed through the world.\r\n\r\nCavour rushed from Turin to Desenzano, where he arrived the day before\r\nthe final meeting between Napoleon and Francis Joseph. He waited for a\r\ncarnage in the little _café_ in the piazza; no one guessed who it was,\r\nand conversation went on undisturbed: it was full of curses on the\r\nFrench Emperor. Mazzini, someone said, was right; this is the way the\r\nwar was sure to end. When a shabby conveyance had at length been\r\nfound, the great statesman drove to Monzambano. There, of course, his\r\narrival did not escape notice, and all who saw him were horrified by\r\nthe change that had come over his face. Instead of the jovial, witty\r\nsmile, there was a look of frantic rage and desperation. What passed\r\nbetween him and his Sovereign is partly a matter of conjecture; the\r\nexact sense of the violent words into which his grief betrayed him is\r\nlost, in spite of the categorical versions of the interview which have\r\nbeen printed. Even in a fit of madness he can hardly have spoken some\r\nof the words attributed to him. That he advised the King to withdraw\r\nhis army or to abdicate rather than agree to the peace which was being\r\nplotted behind his back, seems past doubting. It is said that after\r\nattempting in vain to calm him, Victor Emmanuel brought the interview\r\nto a sudden close. Cavour came out of the house flushed and exhausted,\r\nand drove back to Desenzano. He had resigned office.\r\n\r\nThe King showed extraordinary self-control. Bitter as the draught was,\r\nhe saw that it must be drunk, and he was determined to drink it with\r\ndignity. Probably no other Italian grasped as clearly as he did the\r\nreal reason which actuated Napoleon; at any rate his chivalrous\r\nappreciation of the benefits already received, closed his lips to\r\nreproaches. 'Whatever may be the decision of your Majesty,' he said to\r\nthe Emperor on the eve of Villafranca, 'I shall feel an eternal\r\ngratitude for what you have done for the independence of Italy, and I\r\nbeg you to believe that under all circumstances you may reckon on my\r\ncomplete fidelity.'\r\n\r\nIf there was sadness in the Sardinian camp, so there was in that of\r\nAustria. The Austrians by no means thought that the game was up for\r\nthem. It would be interesting to know by what arguments Napoleon\r\npersuaded the young Emperor to renounce the hope of retrieving his\r\ndisasters, whilst he slowly pulled to pieces some flowers which were\r\non the table before which he and Francis Joseph sat. When they left\r\nthe house, the heir to all the Hapsburgs looked pale and sad. Did he\r\nremember the dying counsels of 'Father' Radetsky--not to yield if he\r\nwas beaten on the Mincio, on the Tagliamento, on the Isonzo, before\r\nthe gates of Vienna.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the evening of the same day, the Emperor of Austria signed\r\nthe preliminaries of peace, he said to Prince Napoleon, who took the\r\ndocument to Verona for his signature: 'I pray God that if you are ever\r\na sovereign He may spare you the hour of grief I have just passed.'\r\nYet the defeat of Solferino and the loss of Lombardy were the first\r\nsteps in the transformation of Radetsky's pupil from a despot, who\r\nhourly feared revolution in every land under his sceptre, to a wise\r\nand constitutional monarch ruling over a contented Empire. To some\r\nindividuals and to some states, misfortune is fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHAT UNITY COST\r\n\r\n1859-1860\r\n\r\nNapoleon III. and Cavour--The Cession of Savoy and Nice--Annexations\r\nin Central Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapoleon's hurried journey to Turin on his way back to France was\r\nalmost a flight. Everywhere his reception was cold in the extreme. He\r\nwas surprised, he said, at the ingratitude of the Italians. It was\r\nstill possible to ask for gratitude, as the services rendered had not\r\nbeen paid for; no one spoke yet of the barter of Savoy and Nice. But\r\nNapoleon, when he said these words to the Governor of Milan, forgot\r\nhow the Lombards, in June 1848, absolutely refused to take their\r\nfreedom at the cost of resigning Venice to Austria. And if Venice was\r\ndear to them and to Italy then, how much dearer had she not become\r\nsince the heroic struggle in which she was the last to yield. The\r\nbones of Manin cried aloud for Venetian liberty from his grave of\r\nexile.\r\n\r\nVenice was the one absorbing thought of the moment; yet there were\r\nclauses in the brief preliminaries of peace more fraught with\r\ninsidious danger than the abandonment of Venice. If the rest of Italy\r\nbecame one and free, it needed no prophet to tell that not the might\r\nof twenty Austrias could keep Venetia permanently outside the fold.\r\nBut if Italy was to remain divided and enslaved, then, indeed, the\r\nindignant question went up to heaven, To what end had so much blood\r\nbeen shed?\r\n\r\nWhen he resolved to cut short the war, Napoleon still had it in his\r\npower to go down to history as the supreme benefactor of Italy. He\r\nchose instead to become her worst and by far her most dangerous enemy.\r\nThe preliminaries of peace opened with the words: 'The Emperor of\r\nAustria and the Emperor of the French will favour the creation of an\r\nItalian Confederation under the honorary presidency of the Holy\r\nFather.' Further, it was stated that the Grand Duke of Tuscany and\r\nthe Duke of Modena would return to their states. Though Napoleon\r\nproposed at first to add, 'without foreign armed intervention,' he\r\nwaived the point (Rome was in his mind) and no such guarantee was\r\ninserted. Here, then, was the federative programme which all the\r\npersonal influence and ingenuity of the French Emperor, all the arts\r\nof French diplomacy, were concentrated on maintaining, and which was\r\nonly defeated by the true patriotism and strong good sense of the\r\nItalian populations, and of the men who led them through this, the\r\nmost critical period in their history.\r\n\r\nIn England Lord Derby's administration had fallen and the Liberals\r\nwere again in power. Napoleon was so strangely deluded as to expect to\r\nfind support in that quarter for his anti-unionist conspiracy. His\r\nearliest scheme was that the federative plan should be presented to\r\nEurope by Great Britain. Lord John Russell answered: 'We are asked to\r\npropose a partition (_morcellement_) of the peoples of Italy, as if we\r\nhad the right to dispose of them.' It was a happy circumstance for\r\nItaly that her unity had no better friends than in the English\r\nGovernment during those difficult years. Cavour's words soon after\r\nVillafranca, 'It is England's turn now,' were not belied.\r\n\r\nOne thing should have made Napoleon uneasy; a man like Cavour, when\r\nhis blood is roused, when his nature is fired by the strongest\r\npassions that move the human heart, is an awkward adversary. If there\r\nwas an instant in which the great statesman thought that all was lost,\r\nit was but an instant. With the quick rebound of virile characters he\r\nrecovered his balance and understood his part. It was to fight and\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\n'Your Emperor has dishonoured me,' he said to M. Pietri in the\r\npresence of Kossuth (the interview taking place at Turin on the 15th\r\nof July). 'Yes, sir, he has dishonoured me,' and he set forth how,\r\nafter promising to hunt the last Austrian out of Italy, after secretly\r\nexacting the price of his assistance to which Cavour had induced his\r\ngood and honest King to consent, he now left them solemnly in the\r\nlurch; Lombardy might suffice! And, for nothing to be wanting, the\r\nKing was to be forced into a confederation with Austria and the\r\nItalian princes under the presidency of the Pope. After painting the\r\nsituation with all the irony and scorn of which he was master, he gave\r\nhis note of warning: 'If needs be, I will become a conspirator, I will\r\nbecome a revolutionist, but this treaty shall never be executed; a\r\nthousand times no--never!'\r\n\r\nThe routine business of the Prime Minister still fell to Cavour, as\r\nRattazzi, who succeeded him, had not yet formed his cabinet. He was\r\nobliged, therefore, to write officially to the Royal Commissioners at\r\nModena, Bologna and Florence to abandon their posts. But in the\r\ncharacter of Cavour, the private citizen, he telegraphed to them at\r\nthe same time to remain and do their duty. And they remained.\r\n\r\nOn one point there was a temporary lull of anxiety. Almost the last\r\nwords spoken by Napoleon to Victor Emmanuel before he left Turin were:\r\n'We shall think no more about Nice and Savoy.' The mention of Nice\r\nshows that though it had not been promised, Napoleon was all along set\r\nupon its acquisition. It is impossible to say how far, at the moment,\r\nhe was sincere in the renunciation. That, very soon after his return\r\nto Paris, he was diligently weaving plans for getting both provinces\r\ninto his net, is evident from the tenor of the articles and notes\r\npublished in the 'inspired' French newspapers.\r\n\r\nTwo chief motives can be divined for Napoleon's determined opposition\r\nto Italian unity which never ceased till Sedan. The first was his\r\nwish, shared by all French politicians, that Italy should be weak. The\r\nsecond was his regard for the Temporal Power which proceeded from his\r\nstill being convinced that he could not reign without the Clerical\r\nvote. The French prelates were perpetually giving him reminders that\r\nthis vote depended on his keeping the Pope on his throne. For\r\ninstance, Cardinal Donnet told him at Bordeaux in October 1859, that\r\nhe could not choose a better way of showing his appreciation of the\r\nBlessed Virgin than 'en ménageant un triomphe à son Fils dans la\r\npersonne de son Vicaire.' It would be a triumph which the Catholic\r\nworld would salute with transport. Hints of this sort, the sense of\r\nwhich was not hard to read, in spite of their recondite phraseology,\r\nreached him from every quarter. He feared to set them aside. The\r\norigins of his power were too much tainted for him to advance boldly\r\non an independent policy. Thus it was that bit by bit he deliberately\r\nforfeited all title to the help of Italy when the same whirlwind that\r\ndashed him to earth, cleared the way for the final accomplishment of\r\nher national destinies.\r\n\r\nWhilst Victor Emmanuel was more alive than Cavour to the military\r\narguments in favour of stopping hostilities when the tide of success\r\nwas at its height, he was not one whit more disposed to stultify his\r\npast by becoming the vassal at once of Paris and Vienna. In a letter\r\nwritten to the Emperor of the French in October, in answer to a very\r\nlong one in which Napoleon sought to convert him to the plan of an\r\nAustro-Italian Confederation, he wound up by saying: 'For the\r\nconsiderations above stated, and for many others, I cannot, Sire,\r\nsecond your Majesty's policy in Italy. If your Majesty is bound by\r\ntreaties and cannot revoke your engagements in the (proposed)\r\ncongress, I, Sire, am bound on my side, by honour in the face of\r\nEurope, by right and duty, by the interests of my house, of my people\r\nand of Italy. My fate is joined to that of the Italian people. We can\r\nsuccumb, but never betray. Solferino and San Martino may sometimes\r\nredeem Novara and Waterloo, but the apostasies of princes are always\r\nirreparable. I am moved to the bottom of my soul by the faith and love\r\nwhich this noble and unfortunate people has reposed in me, and rather\r\nthan be unworthy of it, I will break my sword and throw the crown away\r\nas did my august father. Personal interest does not guide me in\r\ndefending the annexations; the Sword and Time have borne my house from\r\nthe summit of the Alps to the banks of the Mincio, and those two\r\nguardian angels of the Savoy race will bear it further still, when it\r\npleases God.'\r\n\r\nThe events in Central Italy to which the King alludes were of the\r\nhighest importance. L.C. Farini, the Sardinian Royal Commissioner at\r\nModena, when relieved of his office, assumed the dictatorship by the\r\nwill of the people. L. Cipriani became Governor of Romagna, and at\r\nFlorence Ricasoli continued at the head of affairs, undismayed and\r\nunshaken in his resolve to defeat the combined machinations of France\r\nand Austria. In August the populations of Modena, Reggio, Parma and\r\nPiacenza declared their union with Piedmont by an all but unanimous\r\npopular vote, the two last provinces placing themselves for temporary\r\nconvenience under the Dictator Farini. A few days later, Tuscany and\r\nRomagna voted a like act of union through their Constituent\r\nAssemblies. The representatives of the four States, Modena, Parma,\r\nRomagna and Tuscany, formally announced to the great Powers their\r\nchoice of Victor Emmanuel, in whose rule they recognised the sole hope\r\nof preserving their liberties and avoiding disorder. Delegates were\r\nsent to Turin with the offer of the crown.\r\n\r\nPeace, of which the preliminaries only were signed at Villafranca, was\r\nnot yet definitely concluded, and a large French army was still in\r\nItaly. The King's government feared therefore to adopt the bold course\r\nof accepting the annexations outright, and facing the responsibilities\r\nwhich might arise. Victor Emmanuel thanked the delegates, expressing\r\nhis confidence that Europe would not undo the great work that had been\r\ndone in Central Italy. The state of things, however, in these\r\nprovinces, whose elected King could not yet govern them, was\r\nanomalous, most of all in what related to defence; they being menaced\r\non the Austrian side by the Duke of Modena, and on the South by the\r\nPapal troops in the Cattolica. An armed force of 25,000 men was\r\norganised, of which the Tuscan contingent was under the command of\r\nGaribaldi, and the rest under that of the Sardinian General Fanti,\r\n'lent' for the purpose. Garibaldi hoped not merely to defend the\r\nprovinces already emancipated, but to carry war into the enemy's camp\r\nand make revolution possible throughout the States of the Church. To\r\nthe Party of Action the chance seemed an unique one of hastening the\r\nprogress of events. Unaccustomed as they were to weigh diplomatic\r\ndifficulties, they saw the advantages but not the perils of a daring\r\ncourse. Meanwhile Napoleon threatened to occupy Piacenza with 30,000\r\nmen on the first forward step of Garibaldi, who, on his side, seemed\r\nby no means inclined to yield either to the orders of the Dictator\r\nFarini, or to the somewhat violent measures taken to stop him by\r\nGeneral Fanti, who instructed the officers under his command to\r\ndisobey him. It was then that Victor Emmanuel tried his personal\r\ninfluence, rarely tried without success, over the revolutionary chief,\r\nwho reposed absolute faith in the King's patriotism, and who was\r\ntherefore amenable to his arguments when all others failed. The\r\ngeneral was summoned to Turin, and in an audience given on the 16th of\r\nNovember, Victor Emmanuel persuaded him that the proposed enterprise\r\nwould retard rather than advance the cause of Italian freedom.\r\nGaribaldi left for Caprera, only insisting that his 'weak services'\r\nshould be called into requisition whenever there was an opportunity to\r\nact.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Adriatic coast the hero of Rome went one evening\r\nwith his two children, Menotti and Teresita, to the Chapel in the Pine\r\nForest, where their mother was buried. Within a mile was the farmhouse\r\nwhere he had embraced her lifeless form before undertaking his\r\nperilous flight from sea to sea. In 1850, at Staten Island, when he\r\nwas earning his bread as a factory hand, he wrote the prophetic words:\r\n'Anita, a land of slavery holds your precious dust; Italy will make\r\nyour grave free, but what can restore to your children their\r\nincomparable mother?' Garibaldi's visit to Anita's grave closes the\r\nstory of the brave and tender woman who sacrificed all to the love she\r\nbore him.\r\n\r\nAfter sitting for three months, the Conference which met at Zurich to\r\nestablish the definite treaty of peace finished its labours on the\r\n10th of November. The compact was substantially the same as that\r\narranged at Villafranca. Victor Emmanuel, who had signed the\r\nPreliminaries with the reservation implied in the note: 'In so far as\r\nI am concerned,' preserved the same liberty of action in the Treaty of\r\nZurich. He still hesitated, however, in assuming the government of the\r\ncentral provinces, and even the plan of sending the Prince of\r\nCarignano as governor fell through in consequence of Napoleon's\r\nopposition. His hesitations sprang from the general apprehension that\r\na hint from Paris might any day be followed by a new eruption of\r\nAustrians in Modena and Tuscany for the purpose of replacing the\r\nformer rulers of those states on their thrones. Such a fear existed at\r\nthe time, and Rattazzi's timid policy was the result; it is impossible\r\nnot to ask now whether it was not exaggerated? 'What statesman,' wrote\r\nthe Prince Consort in June 1859, 'could adopt measures to force\r\nAustrian rule again upon delighted, free Italy?' If this was true\r\nin June was it less true in November? For the rest, would not the\r\nsupreme ridicule that would have fallen on the French Emperor if he\r\nencouraged the Austrians to return to Central Italy after driving\r\nthem out of Lombardy, have obliged him to support the principle of\r\nnon-intervention, whether he wished it or not? England was prepared to\r\nback up the government of Piedmont, in which lay a great moral force.\r\nIt is plain that the long wavering about what ought to be done with\r\nthe central provinces is what cost the country Savoy and Nice, or at\r\nany rate, Nice. Napoleon did all in his power to prevent and to retard\r\nthe annexations, especially that of Tuscany, which, as he said, 'would\r\nmake Italian unity a mere question of time,' but when he found that\r\nneither threats nor blandishments could move the population from their\r\nresolve to have Victor Emmanuel for their king, he decided to sell his\r\nadhesion for a good price. Compelled for the sake of appearances to\r\nwithdraw his claim after the abrupt termination of the war, he now saw\r\nan excellent excuse for reviving it, and he was not likely to let the\r\nopportunity slip.\r\n\r\nAt this period there was continual talk, which may or may not have\r\nbeen intended to end in talk, of a Congress to which the affairs of\r\nItaly were to be referred. It gave an opening to Napoleon for\r\npublishing one of the anonymous pamphlets by means of which he was in\r\nthe habit of throwing out tentative ideas, and watching their effect.\r\nThe chief idea broached in _Le Pape et le Congrès_ was the voluntary\r\nrenunciation by the Pope of all but a small zone of territory round\r\nRome; it being pointed out that his position as an independent\r\nsovereign would remain unaffected by such an act, which would smooth\r\nthe way to his assuming the hegemony of the Italian Confederation. The\r\nPope, however, let it be clearly known that he had no intention of\r\nceding a rood of his possessions, or of recognising the separation of\r\nthe part which had already escaped from him. Anyone acquainted with\r\nthe long strife and millennial manoeuvres by which the Church had\r\nacquired the States called by her name, will understand the\r\nunwillingness there was to yield them. To do Pius IX. justice, an\r\nobjection which merits more respect weighed then and always upon his\r\nmind. He thought that he was personally debarred by the oath taken on\r\nassuming the tiara from giving up the smallest part of the territory\r\nhe received from his predecessor. The Ultramontane party knew that\r\nthey had only to remind him of this oath to provoke a fresh assertion\r\nof _Non possumus._ The attitude of the Pope was one reason why the\r\nCongress was abandoned; but there was a deeper reason. A European\r\nCongress would certainly not have approved the cession of Nice and\r\nSavoy, and to that object the French Emperor was now turning all his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAt Turin there was an ignoble cabal, supported not so much, perhaps,\r\nby Rattazzi himself as by followers, the design of which was to\r\nprevent Cavour from returning to power. Abroad, the Empress Eugénie,\r\nwho looked on Cavour as the Pope's worst foe, did what she could to\r\nfurther the scheme, and its promoters counted much on the soreness\r\nleft in Victor Emmanuel's mind by the scene after Villafranca. That\r\nsoreness did, in fact, still exist; but when in January the Rattazzi\r\nministry fell, the King saw that it was his duty to recall Cavour to\r\nhis counsels, and he at once charged him to form a cabinet.\r\n\r\nThat Cavour accepted the task is the highest proof of his abnegation\r\nas a statesman. He was on the point of getting into his carriage to\r\ncatch the train for Leri when the messenger reached the Palazzo Cavour\r\nwith the royal command to go to the castle. If he had refused office\r\nand returned to the congenial activity of his life as a country\r\ngentleman, his name would not be attached to the melancholy sacrifice\r\nwhich Napoleon was now determined to exact from Italy. The French\r\nenvoy, Baron de Talleyrand, whose business it was to communicate the\r\nunwelcome intelligence, arrived at Turin before the collapse of\r\nRattazzi; but, on finding that a ministerial crisis was imminent, he\r\ndeferred carrying out his mission till a more opportune moment.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January 1860, the Emperor admitted to Lord Cowley\r\nthat, though there was as yet no arrangement between himself and\r\nVictor Emmanuel on the subject, he intended to have Savoy. After the\r\nlong series of denials of any such design, the admission caused the\r\nmost indignant feeling in the English ministers and in the Queen, who\r\nwrote to Lord John Russell: 'We have been made regular dupes.' She\r\nwent on to say that the revival of the English Alliance, and the hymns\r\nof universal peace chanted in Paris on the occasion of the Commercial\r\nTreaty, had been simply so many blinds, 'to hide from Europe a policy\r\nof spoliation.' Cavour came in for a part of the blame, as, during the\r\nwar, he denied cognisance of the proposal to give up Savoy. The best\r\nthat can be said of that denial is, that it was diplomatically\r\nimpracticable for one party in the understanding of Plombières to make\r\na clean breast of the truth, whilst the other party was assuring the\r\nwhole universe that he was fighting for an idea.\r\n\r\nWhen the war was broken off, Cavour fully expected that Napoleon, of\r\nwhom he had the worst opinion, would then and there demand whole pay\r\nfor his half service; and this had much to do with his furious anger\r\nat Villafranca; but later, in common with the best-informed persons,\r\nhe believed that the claim was finally withdrawn. When, however,\r\nNapoleon asked again for the provinces--not as the price of the war,\r\nbut of the annexations in Central Italy--Cavour instantly came to the\r\nconclusion that, cost what it might (and he thought that, amongst\r\nother things, it would cost his own reputation and popularity), the\r\ndemand must be granted. Otherwise Italian unity would never be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIn considering whether he was mistaken, it must not be forgotten that\r\nthe French troops were still in Italy. Not to speak of those in Rome,\r\nMarshal Vaillant had five divisions of infantry and two brigades of\r\ncavalry in Lombardy up to the 20th of March 1860. The engagement had\r\nbeen to send this army home as soon as the definite peace was\r\nconcluded; why, then, was it still south of the Alps four months\r\nafter?\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, however, and in spite of the difficulty of judging\r\nan act, all the reasons for which may not, even now, be in possession\r\nof the world, it is very hard indeed to pardon Cavour for having\r\nyielded Nice as well as Savoy to France. The Nizzards were Italians as\r\nthe lower class of the population is Italian still; they had always\r\nshown warm sympathy with the hopes of Italy, which could not be said\r\nof the Savoyards; and Nice was the birthplace of Garibaldi!\r\n\r\nEngland would have supported and applauded resistance to the claim for\r\nNice on general grounds, though her particular interest was in Savoy,\r\nor rather in that part of the Savoy Alps which was neutralised by\r\ntreaty in 1814. It was the refusal of Napoleon to adopt the compromise\r\nof ceding this district to Switzerland which caused the breach between\r\nhim and the British ministry. From that moment, also, Prussia began to\r\nincrease her army, and resolved, when she was ready, to check the\r\nimperial ambition by force of arms. 'The loss of Alsace and Lorraine,'\r\nwrites an able publicist, M.E. Tallichet, 'was the direct consequence\r\nof the annexation of Nice and Savoy.'\r\n\r\nIf anything could have rendered more galling to Italy the deprivation\r\nof these two provinces, it was the tone adopted in France when\r\nspeaking of the transaction. What were Savoy and Nice? A barren rock\r\nand an insignificant strip of coast! The French of thirty-four years\r\nago travelled so little that they may have believed in the\r\ndescription. The vast military importance of the ceded districts has\r\nbeen already referred to. Some scraps on the Nice frontier were saved\r\nin a curious way: They were spots which formed part of the favourite\r\nplayground of the Royal Hunter of the Alps, and it was pointed out to\r\nNapoleon that it would be a graceful act to leave these particular\r\n'barren rocks' to his Sardinian Majesty. The zig-zags in the line of\r\ndemarcation which were thus introduced are said to be of great\r\nstrategic advantage to Italy. So far, so good; but it remains true\r\nthat France is _inside_ the Italian front-door.\r\n\r\nAt the elections for the new Chamber in March 1860, the Nizzards chose\r\nGaribaldi; and this was their real plebiscite--not that which followed\r\nat a short interval, and presented the phenomenon of a population\r\nwhich appeared to change its mind as to its nationality in the course\r\nof a few weeks. In voting for Garibaldi, they voted for Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Nizzard hero made some desperate efforts on behalf of his\r\nfellow-citizens in the Chamber, not his natural sphere, and was on the\r\nbrink of making other efforts in a sphere in which he might have\r\nsucceeded better. He had the idea of going to Nice with about 200\r\nfollowers, and exciting just enough of a revolution to let the real\r\nwill of the people be known, and to frustrate the wiles of French\r\nemissaries and the pressure of government in the official plebiscite\r\nof the 15th of April. The story of the conspiracy, which is unknown in\r\nItaly, has been told by one of the conspirators, the late Lawrence\r\nOliphant. The English writer, who reached Turin full of wrath at the\r\nproposed cession, was introduced to Garibaldi, from whom he received\r\nthe news of the proposed enterprise. Oliphant offered his services,\r\nwhich were accepted, and he accompanied the general to Genoa, where he\r\nengaged a diligence which was to carry the vanguard to Nice. But, on\r\ngoing to Garibaldi for the last orders, he found him supping with\r\ntwenty or thirty young men; 'All Sicilians!' said the chief. 'We must\r\ngive up the Nice programme; the general opinion is that we shall lose\r\nall if we try for too much.' He added that he had hoped to carry out\r\nthe Nice plan first, but now everything must be sacrificed to freeing\r\nSicily. And he asked Oliphant to join the Thousand, an offer which the\r\nadventurous Englishman never ceased to regret that he did not accept.\r\nAs it was, he elected to go all the same to Nice, where he was the\r\nspectator and became the historian of the arts which brought about the\r\nsemblance of an unanimous vote in favour of annexation to France.\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the treaty--which, by straining the constitution,\r\nwas concluded without consulting Parliament--was reluctantly given by\r\nthe Piedmontese Chambers, the majority of members fearing the\r\nresponsibility of upsetting an accomplished fact. Cavour, when he laid\r\ndown the pen after signing the deed of cession, turned to Baron de\r\nTalleyrand with the remark: 'Now we are accomplices!' His face, which\r\nhad been depressed, resumed its cheerful air. In fact, though\r\nNapoleon's dislike of the central annexations was unabated, he could\r\nno longer oppose them. Victor Emmanuel accepted the four crowns of\r\nCentral Italy, the people of which, during the long months of waiting,\r\nand under circumstances that applied the most crucial test to their\r\nresolution, had never swerved from the desire to form part of the\r\nItalian monarchy under the sceptre of the _Re Galantuomo_. The King of\r\nSardinia, as he was still called, had eleven million subjects, and on\r\nhis head rested one excommunication the more. The Bull fulminated\r\nagainst all who had, directly or indirectly, participated in the\r\nevents which caused Romagna to change hands, was published a day or\r\ntwo before the opening of the new Parliament at Turin.\r\n\r\nAddressing for the first time the representatives of his widened\r\nrealm, Victor Emmanuel said: 'True to the creed of my fathers, and,\r\nlike them, constant in my homage to the Supreme Head of the Church,\r\nwhenever it happens that the ecclesiastical authority employs\r\nspiritual arms in support of temporal interests, I shall find in my\r\nsteadfast conscience and in the very traditions of my ancestors, the\r\npower to maintain civil liberty in its integrity, and my own\r\nauthority, for which I hold myself accountable to God alone and to my\r\npeople.'\r\n\r\nThe words: 'Della quale debbo ragione a Dio solo ed ai miei popoli,'\r\nwere added by the King to the speech prepared by his ministers; it was\r\nnoticed that he pronounced them with remarkable energy. The speech\r\nconcluded: 'Our country is no more the Italy of the Romans, nor the\r\nItaly of the Middle Ages; no longer the field for every foreign\r\nambition, it becomes, henceforth, the Italy of the Italians.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE MARCH OF THE THOUSAND\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Expedition--Garibaldi at Marsala--Calatafimi--The\r\nTaking of Palermo--Milazzo--The Bourbons evacuate Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the journey from Turin to Genoa, Garibaldi was occupied in\r\nopening, reading and tearing up into small pieces an enormous mass of\r\nletters, while his English companion spent the time in vainly\r\nspeculating as to what this vast correspondence was about. When they\r\napproached Genoa, the floor of the railway carriage resembled a\r\ngigantic wastepaper basket. It was only afterwards that Lawrence\r\nOliphant guessed the letters to be responses to a call for volunteers\r\nfor Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Sicilian expedition has been related in various\r\nways; there is the version which attributes it entirely to Cavour, and\r\nthe version which attributes it to not irresponsible personages in\r\nEngland. The former was the French and Clerical official account; the\r\nlatter has always obtained credence in Germany and Russia. For\r\ninstance, the late Duke Ernest of Saxe-Coburg said that 'the mystery\r\nof how 150,000 men were vanquished by a thousand Red-shirts was\r\nwrapped in English bank-notes!' Of this theory, it need only be said\r\nthat the notion of Lord Palmerston (for it comes to that) supporting a\r\nforeign revolution out of the British exchequer is not one that\r\ncommends itself to the belief of the average Englishman. With regard\r\nto the other theory--namely, that Cavour 'got up' the Sicilian\r\nexpedition, it has been favoured to a certain degree, both by his\r\nfriends and foes; but it will not bear careful examination. As far as\r\nSicily goes (Naples is another thing), the most that can be brought\r\nhome to Cavour is a complicity of toleration; and even this statement\r\nshould be qualified by the addition, 'after the act.' It is true that,\r\nin the early days after Villafranca, he had exclaimed: 'They have cut\r\nme off from making Italy from the north, by diplomacy; very well, I\r\nwill make her from the south, by revolution!' True, also, that\r\nearlier still, in 1856, he expressed the opinion, shared by every man\r\nof common sense, that while the Bourbons ruled over the Two Sicilies\r\nthere would be no real peace for Italy. Nevertheless, in April 1860,\r\nhe neither thought the time ripe for the venture nor the means\r\nemployed adequate for its accomplishment. He was afraid that Garibaldi\r\nwould meet with the death of the Bandieras and Pisacane. No one was\r\nmore convinced than Cavour of the importance of Garibaldi's life to\r\nItaly; and it is a sign of his true superiority of mind that this\r\nconviction was never entertained more strongly than at the moment when\r\nthe general was passionately inveighing against him for the cession of\r\nNice. To Cavour such invectives seemed natural, and even justified\r\nfrom one point of view; they excited in him no bitterness, and he was\r\nonly too happy that they fell upon himself and not upon the King,\r\nsince it was his fixed idea that, without the maintenance of a good\r\nunderstanding between Victor Emmanuel and Garibaldi, Italy would not\r\nbe made. Few men under the sting of personal attacks have shown such\r\ncomplete self-control.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, when Francis II. ascended the Neapolitan throne,\r\nhe was invited to join in the war with Austria, and he refused. Since\r\nthen, the same negative result had attended the reiterated counsels of\r\nreform which the Piedmontese Government sent to that of Naples--the\r\nyoung King showing, by repeated acts, that not Sardinia but Rome was\r\nhis monitress and chosen ally in Italy. The Pope had lately induced\r\nthe French General Lamoricière to take the command of the Pontifical\r\ntroops, and he and the King of Naples were organising their armies,\r\nwith a view to co-operating at an early date against the common enemy\r\nat Turin. In January 1860, Lord Russell wrote to Mr Elliot, the\r\nEnglish Minister at Naples: 'You will tell the King and his Ministers\r\nthat the Government of her Majesty the Queen does not intend to accept\r\nany part in the responsibility nor to guarantee the certain\r\nconsequences of a misgovernment which has scarcely a parallel in\r\nEurope.' Mr Elliot replied, early in March: 'I have used all\r\nimaginable arguments to convince this Government of the necessity of\r\nstopping short on the fatal path which it has entered. I finished by\r\nsaying that I was persuaded of the inevitable fall of his Majesty and\r\nthe dynasty if wiser counsels did not obtain a hearing, and requested\r\nan audience with the King; since, when the catastrophe occurs, I do\r\nnot wish my conscience to reproach me with not having tried all means\r\nof saving an inexperienced Sovereign from the ruin which threatens\r\nhim. The Ministers of France and Spain have spoken to the same\r\neffect.' Even Russia advised Francis to make common cause with\r\nPiedmont. In April, Victor Emmanuel wrote to his cousin, 'as a near\r\nrelative and an Italian Prince,' urging him to listen while there was\r\nyet time to save something, if not everything. 'If you will not hear\r\nme,' he said, 'the day may come when I shall be obliged to be the\r\ninstrument of your ruin!'\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Sardinian Government, in tendering similar\r\nadvice, hoped for its refusal and contemplated the eventuality hinted\r\nat with the reverse of apprehension. Of course this is true. Yet the\r\nresponsibility of declining to take the only course which might by any\r\npossibility have saved him must rest with the King of Naples and not\r\nwith Victor Emmanuel and his Ministers. The attempt to make Francis\r\nappear the innocent victim of a diabolical conspiracy will never\r\nsucceed, however ingenious are the writers who devote their abilities\r\nto so unfruitful a task.\r\n\r\nTo trace the real beginning of the expedition we must go back to the\r\nsummer of 1859. When the war ended in the manner which he alone had\r\nforeseen, Mazzini projected a revolutionary enterprise in the south\r\nwhich should restore to the Italian movement its purely national\r\ncharacter and defeat in advance Napoleon's plans for gathering the\r\nBourbon succession for his cousin, Prince Murat. He sent agents to\r\nSicily, and notably Francesco Crispi, who, as a native of the island\r\nand a man of resource and quick intelligence, was well qualified to\r\nexecute the work of propaganda and to elude the Bourbon police. Crispi\r\ntravelled in all parts of Sicily for several months, and in September\r\nhe was able to report to Mazzini that the insurrection might be\r\nexpected in a few weeks--which proved incorrect, but only as to date.\r\nMazzini forbade his agents to agitate in favour of a republic; unity\r\nwas the sole object to be aimed at; unity in whatever form and at\r\nwhatever cost.\r\n\r\nIn March 1860 he had an interview in London with the man who was to\r\nbecome the actual initiator of the revolutionary movement in South\r\nItaly. This was Rosalino Pilo, son of the Count di Capaci, and\r\ndescended through his mother from the royal house of Anjou, whose\r\nname, Italianised into Gioeni, is still borne by several noble\r\nfamilies in Sicily. Rosalino Pilo, who was now in his fortieth year,\r\nhad devoted all his life to his country's liberties. After 1849, when\r\nhe was obliged to leave Sicily, he sold his ancestral acres to supply\r\nthe wants of his fellow exiles, and help the work of revolutionary\r\npropaganda. Handsome in person, cultivated in mind, ready to give his\r\nlife, as he had already given most of what makes life tolerable, to\r\nthe Italian cause, he won the affection of all with whom he was\r\nbrought in contact, and especially of Mazzini, from whom he parted\r\nafter that last interview radiant with hope, and yet with a touch of\r\nsadness in his smile, as if in prevision that the place allotted to\r\nhim in the ranks of men was among the sowers, not among the reapers.\r\n\r\nRosalino Pilo believed, as Mazzini believed, that Sicily was ripe for\r\nrevolution, but he realised the fact that under existing circumstances\r\nthere was an exceeding probability of a Sicilian revolution being\r\nrapidly crushed. It was the tendency of Mazzini's mind to think the\r\ncontrary; to put more faith in the people themselves than in any\r\nleader or leaders; to imagine that the blast of the trumpet of an\r\nangered population was sufficient to bring down the walls of all the\r\ncitadels of despotism, however well furnished with heavy artillery.\r\nPilo saw that there was only one man who could give a real chance of\r\nsuccess to a rising in his native island, and that man was Garibaldi.\r\nAs early as February he began to write to Caprera, urging the general\r\nto give his co-operation to the projected movement. It is notorious\r\nthat the scheme, until almost the last moment, did not find favour\r\nwith Garibaldi. In spite of his perilous enterprises, the chief had\r\nnever been a courtier of failure, and he understood more clearly than\r\nhis correspondent what failure at that particular juncture would have\r\nmeant. The ventures of the Bandieras and of Pisacane, similar in their\r\ngeneral plan to the one now in view (though on a smaller scale). ended\r\nin disasters, but disasters that were useful to Italy. A disaster now\r\nwould have been ruinous to Italy. Garibaldi's hesitations do not, as\r\nsome writers of the extreme party have foolishly assumed, detract from\r\nhis merit as victorious leader of the expedition; they only show him\r\nto have been more amenable to political prudence than most people\r\nhave supposed.\r\n\r\nRosalino Pilo wrote, finally, that in any case he was determined to go\r\nto Sicily himself to complete the preparations, and he added: 'The\r\ninsurrection in Sicily, consider it well, will carry with it that of\r\nthe whole south of the peninsula,' by which means not only would the\r\nMuratist plots be frustrated, but also a new army and fleet would\r\nbecome available for the conquest of independence and the liberation\r\nof Venetia. The writer concluded by wishing the general 'new glories\r\nin Sicily in the accomplishment of our country's redemption.'\r\n\r\nTrue to his word Rosalino Pilo embarked at Genoa on the 24th of March,\r\non a crazy old coasting vessel, manned by five friendly sailors. He\r\nhad with him a single companion, and carried such arms and ammunition\r\nas he had been able to get together. Terrible weather and the\r\ndeplorable condition of their craft kept them at sea for fifteen days,\r\nduring which time something of great importance happened at Palermo.\r\nOn the 4th of April the authorities became aware that arms and\r\nconspirators were concealed in the convent of La Gancia, which was to\r\nhave been the focus of the revolution. Troops were sent to besiege the\r\nconvent, which they only succeeded in taking after four hours'\r\nresistance; its fall was the signal for a general slaughter of the\r\ninmates, both monks and laymen. The insurrection was thus stifled in\r\nits birth in the capital, but from this time it began to spread in the\r\ncountry, and when, at last, Rosalino Pilo landed near Messina on the\r\n10th of April, he found that several armed bands were already roving\r\nthe mountains, as yet almost unperceived by the Government, which had\r\ngone to sleep again after its exhibition of energy on the 4th. Events\r\nwere, however, to awake it from its slumbers, and to cause it to renew\r\nits vigilance. It required all Rosalino Pilo's skill and courage to\r\nsustain the revolution of which he became henceforth the responsible\r\nhead, till the fated deliverer arrived.\r\n\r\nPilo's letters, brought back to Genoa by the pilot who guided him to\r\nSicilian waters, were what decided Garibaldi to go to the rescue.\r\nSome, like Bixio and Bertani, warmly and persistently urged him to\r\naccept the charge; others, like Sirtori, were convinced that the\r\nundertaking was foredoomed, and that its only result would be the\r\ndeath of their beloved captain: but this conviction did not lessen\r\ntheir eagerness to share his perils when once he was resolved to go.\r\n\r\nLike all born men of action, Garibaldi did not know what doubt was\r\nafter he came to a decision. From that moment his mental atmosphere\r\ncleared; he saw the goal and went straight for it. In a surprisingly\r\nshort time the expedition was organised and ready to leave. 'Few and\r\ngood,' had been the rule laid down by Garibaldi for the enrolments; if\r\nhe had chosen he could have taken with him a much more numerous host.\r\nWhen it was the day to start few they were (according to the most\r\nrecent computation the exact number was 1072 men), and they were\r\ncertainly good. The force was divided into seven companies, the first\r\nentrusted to the ardent Nino Bixio, who acted in a general way as\r\nsecond-in-command through both the Sicilian and Neapolitan campaigns,\r\nand the seventh to Benedetto Cairoli, whose mother contributed a large\r\nsum of money as well as three of her sons to the freeing of Southern\r\nItaly. Sirtori, about whom there always clung something of the\r\npriestly vocation for which he had been designed, was the head of the\r\nstaff; Türr (the Hungarian) was adjutant-general. The organisation was\r\nidentical with that of the Italian army 'to which we belong,' said\r\nGaribaldi in his first order of the day.\r\n\r\nOne name is missing, that of Medici, who was left behind to take the\r\ncommand of a projected movement in the Papal States. By whom this plan\r\nwas invented is not clear, but simultaneous operations in different\r\nparts of the peninsula had been always a favourite design of the more\r\nextreme members of the Party of Action, and Garibaldi probably yielded\r\nto their advice. All that came of it was the entry into Umbria of\r\nZambianchi's small band of volunteers, which was promptly repulsed\r\nover the frontier. Medici, therefore, remained inactive till after the\r\nfall of Palermo; he headed the second expedition of 4,000 volunteers\r\nwhich arrived in time to take part in the final Sicilian battles.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi's political programme was the cry of the Hunters of the Alps\r\nin 1859: _Italy and Victor Emmanuel._ Those who were strict\r\nrepublicans at heart, while abstaining from preaching the republic\r\ntill the struggle was over, would have stopped short at the first word\r\n_Italy_. But Garibaldi told Rosalino Pilo, who was of this way of\r\nthinking, that either he marched in the King's name or he did not\r\nmarch at all. This was the condition of his acceptance, because he\r\nesteemed it the condition on which hung the success of the enterprise,\r\nnay more, the existence of an united Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Thousand embarked at Quarto, near Genoa, during the night of the\r\n5th of May on the two merchant vessels, the _Piemonte_ and _Lombardo_,\r\nwhich, with the complicity of their patriotic owner, R. Rubattino, had\r\nbeen sequestered for the use of the expedition. On hearing of\r\nGaribaldi's departure, Cavour ordered Admiral Persano, whose squadron\r\nlay in the gulf of Cagliari, to arrest the expedition if the steamers\r\nentered any Sardinian port, but to let it go free if they were\r\nencountered on the high seas. Persano asked Cavour what he was to do\r\nif by stress of storms Garibaldi were forced to come into port? The\r\nanswer was that 'the Ministry' decided for his arrest, which Persano\r\nrightly interpreted to mean that Cavour had decided the contrary. He\r\nresolved, therefore, not to stop him under any circumstances, but the\r\ncase did not occur, for the fairest of May weather favoured the\r\nvoyage, and six days after the start the men were quietly landed at\r\nMarsala without let or hindrance from the two Neapolitan warships\r\nwhich arrived almost at the same time as the _Piemonte_ and\r\n_Lombardo_, an inconceivable stroke of good fortune which, like the\r\neventful march that was to follow, seems to belong far more to romance\r\nthan to history.\r\n\r\nOn the day before, the British gunboat _Intrepid_ (Captain Marryat),\r\nand the steam vessel _Argus_, had cast anchor in the harbour of\r\nMarsala. Their presence was again and again spoken of by Garibaldi as\r\nthe key to the mystery of why he was not attacked. No matter how it\r\nwas done--it may have been a mere accident--but it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the English men-of-war did practically cover the landing\r\nof the Thousand. Lord John Russell denied emphatically to the House of\r\nCommons that they were sent there for the purpose, as to this day is\r\nbelieved by some grateful Italians, and by every Clerical writer who\r\nhandles the subject. The British Government had early information of\r\nItalian revolutionary doings, just then, through Sir James Hudson, who\r\nwas in communication with men of all shades of opinion, and it is\r\ncredible that orders which must necessarily have been secret, were\r\ngiven to afford a refuge on board English ships to the flying patriots\r\nin the anticipated catastrophe. More than this is not credible, but\r\nthe energy shown by Captain Marryat in safeguarding the interests of\r\nthe British residents at Marsala caused the Neapolitan ships to delay\r\nopening fire till the very last Red-shirt was out of harm's way on dry\r\nland. Then and then only did they direct their guns on the _Piemonte_\r\nand _Lombardo_, and fire a few shots into the city, which caused no\r\nother damage than the destruction of two casks of wine.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, Garibaldi left Marsala for Salemi, a mountain city\r\napproached by a steep, winding ascent, where he was sure of a warm\r\nreception, as it had already taken arms against the Bourbon king.\r\nHence he promulgated the decree by which he assumed the dictatorship\r\nof Sicily in the name of Victor Emmanuel.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan army numbered from 120,000 to 130,000 men; of these\r\n30,000 were actually in Sicily at the time the Thousand landed at\r\nMarsala, 18,000 being in and about Palermo, and the rest distributed\r\nover the island. At Salemi, Garibaldi reviewed his united forces: he\r\nhad been joined by 200 fresh volunteers, and by a fluctuating mass of\r\nSicilian irregulars, which might be estimated to consist of 2,000 men,\r\nbut it increased or decreased along the road, because it was formed of\r\npeasants of the districts traversed, who did not go far from their\r\nhomes. These undisciplined bands were not useless, as they gave the\r\nBourbon generals the idea that Garibaldi had more men than he could\r\never really count upon, and also the peasants knew the country well.\r\nWhen they came under fire they behaved better than anyone would have\r\nexpected. The first batch joined the Thousand half-way between Marsala\r\nand Salemi. There might have been fifty of them, dressed in\r\ngoat-skins, and armed with the old flint muskets and rusty pistols\r\ndear to the Sicilian heart, which he would not for the world leave\r\nbehind were he going no farther than to buy a lamb at the fair. The\r\nfeudal lord marched at the head of his uncouth retainers--a company\r\nof bandits in an opera--yet, to Garibaldi, they seemed the blessed\r\nassurance that this people whom he was come to save was ready and\r\nwilling to be saved. He received the poor little band with as much\r\nrapture as if it had been a powerful army, and, in their turn, the\r\nimpressionable islanders were enraptured by the affability of the man\r\nwhom the population of Sicily soon came seriously to consider as a new\r\nMessiah. It is a fact that the people of Southern Italy did believe\r\nthat Garibaldi had in him something superhuman, only the Bourbon\r\ntroops looked rather below than above for the source of it. The\r\npicturesque incidents of the historic march were many; one other may\r\nbe mentioned. While the chief watered his horse at a spring a\r\nFranciscan friar threw himself on his knees, and implored to be\r\nallowed to follow him. Some of the volunteers thought the friar a\r\ntraitor in disguise, but larger in faith, Garibaldi said: 'Come with\r\nus, you will be our Ugo Bassi.' Fra Pantaleo proved of no small use to\r\nthe expedition.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map makes clear the military situation. Garibaldi's\r\nobjective was Palermo, and if anything shows his genius as a\r\nCondottiere it is this immediate determination to make straight for\r\nthe capital where the largest number of the enemy's troops was massed,\r\ninstead of seeking an illusionary safety for his weak army in the open\r\ncountry. As the crow flies the distance from Marsala to Palermo is not\r\nmore than sixty or seventy miles, but the routes being mountainous,\r\nthe actual ground to be covered is much longer. About midway lies\r\nCalatafimi, where all the roads leading from the eastern coast to\r\nPalermo converge, and above it towers the immensely strong position\r\ncalled Pianto dei Romani, from a battle in which the Romans were\r\ndefeated. These heights command a vast prospect, and here General\r\nLandi, with 3,000 men and four pieces of artillery, prepared to\r\nintercept the Garibaldians with every probability of driving them back\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nThe royal troops took the offensive towards ten o'clock on the 15th of\r\nMay. They met the Red-shirts half way down the mountain, but were\r\ndriven up it again, inch by inch, till, at about three o'clock, they\r\nwere back at Pianto dei Romani. A final vigorous assault dislodged\r\nthem from this position, and they retreated in disorder to Calatafimi.\r\nNot wishing to tempt fortune further for that day, Garibaldi\r\nbivouacqued on the field of battle. In a letter written to Bertani, on\r\nthe spur of the moment, he bore witness with a sort of fatherly pride\r\nto the courage displayed by the Neapolitans: 'It was the old\r\nmisfortune,' he said, 'a fight between Italians; but it proved to me\r\nwhat can be done with this family when united. The Neapolitan\r\nsoldiers, when their cartridges were exhausted, threw stones at us in\r\ndesperation.' How then, with much superior numbers and a seemingly\r\nimpregnable position, did they end in ignominious flight? The answer\r\nmay be found in the reply given to Bixio, bravest of the brave, who\r\nyet feared, at one hotly-contested point, that retreat was inevitable.\r\n'Here,' retorted the chief,'we _die_.' Men who really mean to conquer\r\nor die can do miracles.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of the victory was tremendous. The world at large had\r\nmade absolutely sure of the destruction of the expedition. 'Garibaldi\r\nhas chosen to go his own way,' said Victor Emmanuel; 'but if you only\r\nknew the fright I was in about him and the brave lads with him!' In\r\nSicily, where the insurrectionary activity of April was almost totally\r\nspent, the news sent an electric shock of revolution through the\r\nwhole island. In the mountains Rosalino Pilo still resisted, weary of\r\nwaiting for the help that came not, discouraged or hopeless, but\r\nunyielding. Food and ammunition were almost gone; his ragged band,\r\nheld together only by the magnetism of his personal influence, began\r\nto feel the pangs of hunger. A price was set on his head, and he was\r\nharassed on all sides by the Neapolitan troops, whose attacks became\r\nmore frequent now that the Government realised that there was danger.\r\nHe knew nothing of Garibaldi's movements; but he was resolved to keep\r\nhis promise as long as he could: to hold out till the chief came. At\r\nthe hour when everything looked most desperate, a messenger arrived in\r\nhis camp with a letter in Garibaldi's handwriting, which bore the date\r\nof the 16th of May. 'Yesterday,' it ran, we fought and conquered.'\r\nNever was unexpected news more welcome. Filled with a joy such as few\r\nmen have tasted, Rosalino read the glad tidings to his men. 'The cause\r\nis won,' he said. 'In a few days, if the enemy's balls respect me, we\r\nshall be in Palermo.'\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Garibaldi had occupied Calatafimi, and was proceeding\r\ntowards Monreale, from which side he contemplated a descent on the\r\ncapital. On the high tableland of Renda he met Rosalino Pilo with his\r\nreanimated band. That day the Garibaldian army, all told, amounted to\r\n5,000 men. On the 21st of May, Rosalino was ordered to make a\r\nreconnaissance in the direction of Monreale; while carrying out this\r\norder a Neapolitan bullet struck his forehead, causing almost\r\ninstantaneous death. 'I am happy to be able to give my blood to Italy,\r\nbut may heaven be propitious once for all,' he had written when he\r\nfirst landed, words realised to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitans were put in high spirits by Rosalino Pilo's death; the\r\ndiscomfiture of Calatafimi was forgotten; they represented Garibaldi\r\nas a mouse that was obligingly walking into a well-laid trap. In fact,\r\nhis position could not have been more critical, but he had recourse to\r\na stratagem which saved him. He succeeded in placing the enemy upon a\r\ncompletely false scent. Abandoning the idea of reaching Palermo from\r\nthe east (Monreale), he decided to attempt the assault from the south\r\n(Piana de' Greci and Misilmeri), but, all the while, he continued to\r\nthrow the Sicilian _Picciotti_ on the Monreale route, and gave them\r\norders to fire stray shots in every direction and to light innumerable\r\ncamp-fires. These troops frequently came in contact with the\r\nNeapolitans in trifling skirmishes, and kept their attention so well\r\noccupied that General Colonna, in command of the force sent in search\r\nof the 'Filibuster,' did not doubt that the whole Garibaldian army was\r\nconcentrated over Monreale. Garibaldi rapidly moved his own column by\r\nnight to its new base of operations. The ground was steep and\r\ndifficult, and a storm raged all the night; fifteen years later he\r\ndeclared that none of his marches in the virgin forests of America was\r\nso arduous as this. While the Neapolitans remained in ignorance of\r\nthese changes, three English naval officers, guided by a sort of\r\nsporting dog's instinct, happened to be driving through the village of\r\nMisilmeri just after Garibaldi established his headquarters in that\r\nneighbourhood. Of course it was by chance; still, Misilmeri is an odd\r\nplace to go for an afternoon drive, and the escapade ended in the\r\nissue of a severe warning to Her Majesty's officers and marines to\r\nkeep in future 'within the bounds of the sentinels of the royal\r\ntroops.' Luckily record exists of the experiences of Lieutenant Wilmot\r\nand his two companions at Misilmeri. Garibaldi, on hearing that three\r\nEnglish naval officers were in the village, sent to invite them to the\r\nvineyard where he was taking his dinner. They found him standing in a\r\nlarge enclosure in the midst of a group of followers who all, like\r\nhimself, wore the legendary red flannel shirt and grey trousers. Fra\r\nPantaleo's brown habit formed the only exception. Several Hungarian\r\nofficers were present, and by his father stood Menotti, then a stout\r\nyouth of nineteen, with his arm in a sling from the severe wound he\r\nreceived at Calatafimi. Around were soldiers who looked like mere\r\nboys. They gazed with delight on the English uniforms. Garibaldi\r\nrequested his guests to be seated and to partake of some\r\nfreshly-gathered strawberries. He spoke of his affection and respect\r\nfor England, and said it was his hope soon to make the acquaintance of\r\nthe British admiral. He mentioned how he had seen and admired from the\r\nheights the beautiful effect of the salutes fired in honour of the\r\nQueen's birthday, two days before. He then retired into his tent, made\r\nof an old blanket stretched over pikes; a child, under the name of a\r\nsentry, paced before it to keep off the crowd.\r\n\r\nTo complete the deception of the enemy the Garibaldian artillery,\r\nunder Colonel Orsini, was ordered to make a retrograde march on\r\nCorleone previous to joining the main force at Misilmeri. Orsini\r\nnarrowly escaped getting caught while executing this movement, and for\r\nthe sake of celerity was obliged to throw his five cannon (including\r\none taken at Calatafimi) down deep water courses. He returned to pull\r\nthem out again when the immediate danger was past. General Colonna,\r\nwho followed him closely, was convinced that the whole of the\r\nGaribaldians were in disorderly retreat as witnessed by the mules and\r\nwaggons purposely abandoned by Orsini along the route. For four days\r\nColonna believed that he had Garibaldi flying before him, and sent\r\nintelligence to that effect to Naples, whence it was published through\r\nthe world. On the fifth day he was immeasurably surprised by hearing\r\nthat Garibaldi had entered Palermo!\r\n\r\nIt was at early dawn on Whitsunday, the 27th of May, that Garibaldi\r\nreached the threshold of the capital, and after overcoming the guard\r\nat Ponte dell' Ammiraglio, pushed on to Porta Termini, the strategic\r\nkey to the city. The royalists, though taken by surprise in the first\r\ninstance, had time to dispose a strong force behind walls and\r\nbarricades before Garibaldi could reach the gate, and it required two\r\nhours of severe fighting to take the position. Many Red-shirts were\r\nkilled, and Benedetto Cairoli received the severe wound from which he\r\nnever wholly recovered. Success, however, was complete, and the\r\nPalermitans got up to find, to their frantic joy, the Liberator within\r\ntheir gates. According to the old usage their first impulse was to run\r\nto the belfries in order to sound the tocsin, but they found that the\r\nroyalists had removed the clappers of the bells. Nothing daunted, they\r\nbeat the bells all day with hammers and other implements, and so\r\nproduced an indescribable noise which had a material influence on the\r\nnerves of the terrified Neapolitan troops. Being disarmed, the only\r\nother help which the inhabitants could render to their deliverers was\r\nthe erection of barricades.\r\n\r\nEven after Garibaldi's entry, it is thought that General Lanza could\r\nhave crushed him in the streets by sheer force of superiority in\r\nnumbers and artillery had he made proper use of his means. However, at\r\nabout three p.m., he chose the less heroic plan of ordering the castle\r\nand the Neapolitan fleet to bombard the city. Most of his staff\r\nopposed the decision, and one officer broke his sword, but Lanza was\r\ninexorable. The measure so exasperated the Palermitans that even had\r\nit achieved its end for the moment, never after would they have proved\r\ngovernable from Naples. Thirteen hundred shells were thrown into the\r\ncity. Lord Palmerston denounced the bombardment and its attendant\r\nhorrors as 'unworthy of our time and of our civilisation.' The\r\nsoldiers helped the work by setting fire to some quarters of the city.\r\nAmong the spots where the shells fell in most abundance was the\r\nconvent of the Sette Angeli. The Garibaldians escorted the nuns to a\r\nplace of safety and carried their more valuable possessions after\r\nthem. The good sisters were charmed by the courtesy with which the\r\nyoung Italians performed these duties.\r\n\r\nFighting in the streets went on more or less continuously, and the\r\nliberators kept their ground, but every hour brought fresh perils. A\r\nBavarian regiment arrived to reinforce General Lanza, and the return\r\nof the Neapolitan column from Corleone was momentarily expected. The\r\nGaribaldians, and this was the gravest fact of all, had used almost\r\ntheir last cartridge. The issue of the struggle was awaited with\r\nvarying sentiments on board the English, French, Austrian, Spanish and\r\nSardinian warships at anchor in the bay. Admiral Mundy had placed his\r\nsquadron so close to the land that the ships were in danger of\r\nsuffering from the bombardment, a course attributed to the humane\r\ndesire to afford a refuge for non-combatants, and in fact, the\r\nofficers were soon engaged in entertaining a frightened crowd of\r\nladies and children. The _Intrepid_ in particular, was so near the\r\nMarina that a fair swimmer could have reached it in a few minutes;\r\nnobody guessed, least of all Garibaldi, that her mission in the mind\r\nof the British admiral was to save the chiefs own life in what seemed\r\nthe likely case of its being placed in peril.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Mundy begged the authorities to stop the bombardment before\r\nthe city was destroyed, but Lanza appeared to have no intention of\r\nyielding to his counsels, and it is still uncertain what at last\r\ninduced him on the 30th of May to sue the Filibuster, hastily\r\ntransformed into his Excellency, for an armistice of twenty-four\r\nhours. 'God knows,' writes Garibaldi, 'if we had want of it!' The\r\nroyalists had lost nearly the whole city except the palace and its\r\nsurroundings, and, cut off from the sea, they began to feel a scarcity\r\nof food, but not to a severe extent. It seems most probable that with\r\nhis men panic-stricken and constantly driven back in spite of the\r\nbombardment, Lanza looked upon the game as lost, when had he known the\r\nstraits to which the Garibaldians were reduced for ammunition, he\r\nmight have considered it as won.\r\n\r\nAn unforeseen incident now occurred; the royalist column, recalled\r\nfrom Corleone, which was largely composed of Bavarians, reached Porta\r\nTermini and opened a furious fire on the weak Garibaldian detachment\r\nstationed there. Was it ignorance or bad faith? Lieutenant Wilmot, who\r\nhappened to be passing by, energetically waved his handkerchief and\r\nshouted that a truce was concluded; the assailants continued the\r\nattack till an officer of the Neapolitan staff who was in conference\r\nwith Garibaldi at the time hurried to the spot, at his indignant\r\nrequest, and ordered them to desist. A few minutes later, Garibaldi\r\nhimself rode up in a wrathful mood, and while he was renewing his\r\nprotests, a shell fell close by him, thrown from a ship which\r\nre-opened the bombardment on its own account. Lieutenant Wilmot, who\r\nwitnessed the whole affair, was convinced that there was a deliberate\r\nplan to surprise and capture the Italian chief after he had granted\r\nthe armistice.\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past two on this eventful day, the 30th of May 1860,\r\nGaribaldi and the Neapolitan generals, Letizia and Chretien, stepped\r\non board the flag-ship _Hannibal_ which Admiral Mundy offered as\r\nneutral ground for their meeting. Curiously enough, both parties,\r\nreaching the mole simultaneously, were rowed out in the same ship's\r\nboat, which was waiting in readiness. The Neapolitans insisted that\r\nGaribaldi should go on board first, either from courtesy or, as the\r\nadmiral suspected, out of desire to find out whether he would be\r\nreceived with military honours. With instinctive tact he had donned\r\nhis old and rather shabby uniform of a major-general in the Sardinian\r\narmy; the admiral's course was, therefore, marked out, and Garibaldi\r\nreceived the same salute as the two generals who followed him. After a\r\nfoolish attempt on the part of the Neapolitan officers to make\r\nthemselves disagreeable, which was repressed with dignified decision\r\nby Admiral Mundy, business began, and things went smoothly till the\r\nfifth article of the proposed convention came under discussion: 'That\r\nthe municipality should direct a humble petition to his Majesty the\r\nKing expressing the real wants of the city.' 'No,' cried Garibaldi,\r\nstarting to his feet, 'the time for humble petitions to the King, or\r\nto anyone else, is past; I am the municipality, and I refuse.' General\r\nLetizia grew excited at this declaration, but afterwards he agreed to\r\nsubmit the question of quashing the fifth article to his chief,\r\nGeneral Lanza. The armistice was prolonged till nine the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he was back on shore, Garibaldi issued a manifesto, in\r\nwhich he announced that he had refused a proposal dishonouring the\r\ncity, and that to-morrow, at the close of the armistice, he should\r\nrenew hostilities. There was a splendid audacity in the threat; his\r\npowder was literally exhausted; nothing was left for him to do but to\r\ndie with all his men, and to do this he and they were unquestionably\r\nready. The conduct of the citizens was on a level with the occasion.\r\nAs soon as the manifesto came to be known, the inhabitants rushed to\r\nthe Palazzo Pretorio, where the man who had so proudly answered in\r\ntheir name, addressed them in these terms: 'People of Palermo; the\r\nenemy has made me propositions which I judged humiliating to you, and\r\nknowing that you are ready to bury yourselves under the ruins of your\r\ncity, I refused.' Those who were present say that never did Garibaldi\r\nseem so great as at that moment. The answer was one deafening shout,\r\nin which the women and children joined, of 'War! war!' In the evening\r\nthe city was illuminated as on a feast-day.\r\n\r\nOnce more in history, the game of greatly daring succeeded. Appalled\r\nby the reports of the dreadful threats emanating from a population\r\nwithout arms, and a handful of volunteers without powder, distrustful\r\nhenceforth of the courage of his soldiers, and, if the truth must\r\nbe told, of the fidelity of his fleet, Lanza sent General Letizia\r\nto Garibaldi betimes, on the 31st of May, with an unconditional\r\ndemand for the continuance of the armistice. A convention was drawn up,\r\nwhich conceded the fullest liberty to the royalists to supply their\r\nmaterial wants, succour the wounded, and, if they desired, embark\r\nthem on board ships with their families for Naples. Garibaldi, always\r\nhumane, had a special tenderness for the victims of that civil strife\r\nwhich his soul abhorred, and he never forgot that the enemy was his\r\nfellow-countryman. His influence sufficed to secure to the royal\r\ntroops an immunity from reprisals which was the more creditable\r\nbecause some horrid crimes had been done by miscreants in their ranks\r\nwhen they found that they were getting the worst of it in the\r\nstreet-fighting. Unfortunately the same mercy was not extended to some\r\nof the secret agents of Maniscalco, head of the Sicilian police, who,\r\ndiscovered in hiding-places by the mob, were murdered before any\r\nprotection could be given them. At the time the act of barbarity was\r\njudged, even by English observers, with more leniency than it deserved\r\n(because cruelty can have _no_ excuse), so great was the disgust\r\nexcited by the most odious system of espionage ever put in practice.\r\n\r\nThe convention bore the signatures of 'Ferdinando Lanza,\r\nGeneral-in-Chief,' and of 'Francesco Crispi, Secretary of State to the\r\nProvisional Government of Sicily.' One article provided for the\r\nconsignment of the Royal Mint to the victors; a large sum was stored\r\nin its coffers, and Garibaldi found himself in the novel position of\r\nbeing able to pay his men and the Sicilian _squadre_, and to send\r\nlarge orders for arms and ammunition to the Continent.\r\n\r\nGeneral Letizia made two journeys to Naples, and on his return from\r\nthe second he came invested with full powers to treat with Garibaldi\r\nfor the evacuation of the city. On the 7th of June, 15,000 royal\r\ntroops marched down to the Marina to the ships that were to take them\r\naway. At the entrance of the Toledo, the great main street of Palermo,\r\nMenotti Garibaldi was on guard, on a prancing black charger, with a\r\nfew other Red-shirts of his own age around him, and before this group\r\nof boys defiled the might and pomp of the disciplined army to which\r\nKing Bomba had given the thoughtful care of a life-time.\r\n\r\nThe closing formalities which wound up these events at Palermo formed a\r\nfitting ending to the dramatic scenes which have been briefly narrated.\r\nOn the 19th, General Lanza went on board the _Hannibal_ to take leave of\r\nthe British admiral. He was covered with decorations and attended by his\r\nbrilliant personal staff. There, in the beautiful bay, lay the ship on\r\nboard which he was to sail at sunset, and twenty-four steam transports\r\nwere also there, each filled with Neapolitan troops. The defeated\r\ngeneral was deeply moved as he walked on to the quarter-deck. 'We have\r\nbeen unfortunate,' he said--words never spoken by one officer of\r\nunquestioned personal courage to another without striking a responsive\r\nchord. When he quitted the _Hannibal_, the English admiral ordered the\r\nWhite Flag of the King of the Two Sicilies to be hoisted at the\r\nforetop-gallant masthead for the last time in Sicilian waters; and a\r\nsalute of nineteen guns, the salute due to the direct representative or\r\n_alter ego_ of a sovereign, speeded the parting guest. Thus, wrapped in\r\nthe dignity of misfortune, vanished the last semblance of the graceless\r\nand treacherous thraldom of the Spanish Bourbons in the capital of\r\nSicily. The flag of Italy was run up on the tower of the Semaphore.\r\nEverywhere the revolution triumphed except at Messina, Milazzo and\r\nSyracuse. Even Catania, where a rising had been put down after a\r\nsanguinary struggle, was now evacuated and left to itself.\r\n\r\nSo the 20th of June dawned, and the Queen's ships in the harbour put\r\nforth all their bravery of flags in commemoration of her accession,\r\nwhich display was naturally interpreted by the Palermitans as a\r\ncompliment to the Dictator, who had fixed that day for calling on the\r\nBritish, French and Sardinian admirals and on the captain of the\r\nUnited States frigate _Iroquois_. With what honours the American\r\ncaptain received him is not recorded; for certain it was with cordial\r\ngoodwill; of the others, Admiral Mundy treated him as on the previous\r\noccasion; the French admiral affected to consider him a 'simple\r\nmonsieur' who had unexpectedly come to call, whilst Admiral Persano,\r\non board the _Maria Adelaide_, gave him a salute of nineteen guns,\r\nwhich formed a virtual recognition on the part of Piedmont of his\r\nassumption of the dictatorship. Cavour had ordered Persano to act on\r\nhis own responsibility as the exigencies of the hour demanded, and the\r\nadmiral knew that these vague instructions assigned him a more\r\nvigorous policy than the other ministers would have agreed to\r\nofficially. His bold initiative was therefore justified. As some\r\nsevere words will have to be said of Persano in a later chapter, it is\r\nwell to remark here that during his Sicilian command he behaved like a\r\nthorough patriot, although it was not in his power to render such\r\ngreat moral services to freedom as were undoubtedly rendered by\r\nAdmiral Mundy, who at the same time acted with so much tact that his\r\nneutrality was not impugned, and he even won the equal personal\r\ngratitude of both parties. On the other hand, the Austrian commodore,\r\nBaron von Wüllersdorf, succeeded in pleasing no one and no one pleased\r\nhim. He did not expect that the Garibaldians would lose much love to\r\nhim, but he took it unkindly that the royalists fired at his boat with\r\nhimself in it, and the Austrian flag at the stern. In high dudgeon he\r\nrelated this grievance to his British colleague, who gently suggested\r\nthat since Austria had always supported the Bourbon system of\r\nGovernment, it was hardly strange if the royalists were hurt at\r\nreceiving neither assistance nor even sympathy from the Austrian\r\nsquadron which witnessed their destruction. The remark was acute; even\r\nAustria was, in fact, tired of the Bourbons of Naples; a portent of\r\ntheir not distant doom. But it was not likely that the royalists\r\nshould appreciate the phlegmatic attitude of their erewhile\r\nprotectors.\r\n\r\nThe concluding military operations in Sicily presented a more arduous\r\ntask than, in the first flush of success, might have been anticipated.\r\nIn the general panic, one, if one only, royalist officer, Colonel Del\r\nBosco, turned round and stood at bay. His spirited course was not far\r\nfrom undoing all that had been done. Fortunately Garibaldi had\r\nreceived important reinforcements. General Medici touched the Sicilian\r\nshores three days after the evacuation of Palermo with 3500\r\nvolunteers, well-armed and equipped out of the so-called 'Million\r\nRifle Fund,' which was formed by popular subscription in the north of\r\nItaly. The Dictator went as far as Alcamo to meet the hero of the last\r\nglorious fight of Rome, whom he greeted with delight and affection.\r\nLater, arrived the third and last expedition, consisting of 1500 men\r\nunder Cosenz, till recently commander-in-chief of the Italian army.\r\nThe Sicilian _squadre_ had been brought into something like military\r\norganisation; and an Englishman, Colonel Dunne, had raised a picked\r\ncorps of 400 Palermitans which contained, besides its commander,\r\nbetween thirty and forty of his countrymen, and was hence called the\r\nEnglish Regiment. This battalion was ready to do anything and go\r\nanywhere; it performed excellent work both in Sicily and on the\r\nmainland.[5]\r\n\r\nGaribaldi arranged his forces in three divisions; one, under Türr, was\r\nsent to Catania; the second, under Bixio, to Girgenti; the third,\r\nunder Medici, was to follow the northern sea-coast towards Messina,\r\nthe strongest position still in the enemy's hands. All three were\r\nultimately to converge with a view to the grand object of crossing\r\nover to the mainland. Medici had 2500 men; the royalists in and about\r\nMessina could dispose of 15,000. The Garibaldians did not expect much\r\nopposition till they got near Messina, but when they reached\r\nBarcelona they heard that the garrison of Milazzo had been reinforced\r\nby Del Bosco with 4000 men, with the evident design of cutting off\r\ntheir passage to Messina. It is said that this move was made in\r\nconsequence of direct communications between that officer and Francis\r\nII., whose ministers had already decided to abandon the whole island.\r\nBut Del Bosco secretly assured his King that such a measure was not\r\nnecessary, and that he would undertake not only to bar Medici's\r\nadvance, but to march over the dead bodies of the Garibaldians to\r\nPalermo. Milazzo is a small hilly peninsula, on which stands a fort\r\nand a little walled city. The spot was well chosen. On the 17th of\r\nJuly, Del Bosco attacked the Garibaldian right, and it was not without\r\ndifficulty that Medici retained his positions. Some further\r\nreinforcements were sent to Del Bosco from Messina, though not so\r\nnumerous as they ought to have been, but they would have almost\r\nensured him the victory had not Medici also received help; Cosenz'\r\ncolumn, and, yet more important, Garibaldi himself with the 1000 men\r\nhe had kept in Palermo, hastening at full speed to the rescue. The\r\nbelligerents were, for once, about equally balanced in numbers when on\r\nthe 20th of July Garibaldi attacked Del Bosco with the purpose of\r\ndriving him on to the tongue of the peninsula, thus cutting him off\r\nfrom Messina and leaving the road open. A desperate engagement\r\nfollowed. The Neapolitans showed that they could fight if they were\r\nproperly led, and inflicted a loss of 800 in killed and wounded (heavy\r\nout of a total of 5000) on their gallant opponents. Garibaldi's own\r\nlife was nearly sacrificed. He was standing in a field of prickly\r\npears in conversation with Major Missori when a party of the enemy's\r\ncavalry rode up, the captain of which dealt a violent blow at him with\r\nhis sword, without knowing who it was. Garibaldi coolly parried the\r\nblow, and struck down his assailant, while Missori shot the three\r\nnearest dragoons with his revolver. Hearing the noise, other\r\nGaribaldians hurried up, and the chief was saved. For a long time the\r\nissue of the battle remained uncertain, and it was only after hours of\r\nsevere fighting that Del Bosco was compelled to recognise his defeat,\r\nand to take refuge on the projecting strip of land as Garibaldi had\r\nmeant that he should do.\r\n\r\nA few days later, four transports arrived in the bay of Milazzo to\r\ncarry Del Bosco and his men to Naples. The ministry had prevailed, and\r\nthe complete abandonment of the island was decreed. General Clary,\r\ncommandant of Messina, informed Garibaldi that he had orders to\r\nevacuate the town and its outlying forts; the citadel would be also\r\nhanded over if the Dictator would engage not to cross to the mainland,\r\nbut this conditional offer was declined. The citadel of Messina\r\ntherefore remained in the power of the royalists, but on agreement\r\nthat it should not resume hostilities unless attacked. It only\r\ncapitulated in March 1861. Garibaldi reigned over the rest of the\r\nisland. The convention was signed on the 28th of July by Marshal\r\nTommaso de Clary for the King of Naples, and Major-General Giacomo\r\nMedici for the Dictator.\r\n\r\nBefore following Garibaldi across the Straits, some allusion is called\r\nfor to the general political situation both in Sicily and in Italy.\r\nAnd first as regards Sicily. When a government is pulled down another\r\nmust be set up, and the last task is often not the easiest. Garibaldi\r\nappointed a ministry in which the ruling spirit was Francesco Crispi.\r\nA Sicilian patriot from his youth, and one of the Thousand, he has\r\nbeen judged the man best fitted to direct the helm of United Italy in\r\ndays of unexampled difficulty. This is enough to prove that he was not\r\nthe first-come ignoramus or madman that some people then liked to\r\nthink him. But Crispi had the art of making enemies, nor has he lost\r\nit. Though volumes have been written on the civil administration under\r\nthe dictatorship, the writers' judgments are so warped by their\r\npolitical leanings that it is not easy to get at the truth. It would\r\nhave been strange had no confusion existed, had no false steps been\r\nmade; yet some of the old English residents in Sicily say that the\r\nisland made more real progress during the few months of Garibaldi's\r\nreign than in all the years that have followed. Towards the end of\r\nJune, Garibaldi appointed Agostino Depretis as Pro-Dictator. Of the\r\nmany decrees formulated and measures adopted at this period,\r\nGaribaldi, who had many other things to think of, was personally\r\nresponsible only for those of a philanthropic nature. Busy as he was,\r\nhe found time to inquire minutely into the State of the population of\r\nPalermo, and he was horrified at the ignorance and misery in which the\r\npoorer classes were plunged. Forthwith, out came a bushel-basket of\r\nedicts and appeals on behalf of these poor children of the sun. He\r\nvisited the orphan asylum and found that eighty per cent. of the\r\ninmates died of starvation. One nurse had to provide for the wants of\r\nfour infants. Garibaldi wrote off an address to the ladies of Palermo,\r\nin which he implored them to interest themselves in the wretched\r\nlittle beings created in the image of God, at the sight of whose\r\nwasted and puny bodies he, an old soldier, had wept. He had money and\r\nfood distributed every morning to the most destitute, at the gates of\r\nthe royal palace, where he lived with a frugality that scandalised the\r\naged servants of royalty whom he kept, out of kindness, at their\r\nposts. Theoretically, he disapproved of indiscriminate almsgiving, but\r\nin the misery caused by the recent bombardment, such theories could\r\nnot be strictly applied, or, at any rate, Garibaldi was not the man to\r\nso apply them; whence it happened that though, as _de facto_ head of\r\nthe State, he allowed himself a civil list of eight francs a day, the\r\nmorning had never far advanced before his pockets were empty, and he\r\nhad to borrow small sums from his friends, which next morning were\r\nfaithfully repaid.\r\n\r\nWhen he walked about the town, the women pressed forward to touch the\r\nhem of his _poncho_, and made their children kneel to receive his\r\nblessing. On one occasion a convent of nuns, from the youngest novice\r\nto the elderly abbess, insisted on giving him the kiss of peace. An\r\nidolatry which would have made anyone else ridiculous; but Garibaldi,\r\nbeing altogether simple and unselfconscious, was above ridicule. One\r\nof the good works that he initiated was the transformation of the\r\nFoundling Hospital, of which the large funds were turned to little\r\naccount, into a Military School under the direction of his best\r\nofficers. In less than a month the school could turn out two smart\r\nbattalions, and there were few mornings that the Dictator did not go\r\nto watch the boys at their drill. He encouraged them with the promise\r\nthat before long he would lead them himself to the wars.\r\n\r\nSuch actions smell sweeter from the dust, than the old story of the\r\nantagonism that sprang up in those days between Garibaldi and Cavour,\r\nbetween Crispi and La Farina. This dualism, as it was called, was the\r\nfruit of a mutual distrust, which, however much to be deplored, was\r\nnot to be avoided. Although Cavour had a far juster idea of Garibaldi\r\nthan that entertained by his _entourage_, he was nevertheless haunted\r\nby the fear that the general's revolutionary friends would persuade\r\nhim to depart from his programme of 'Italy and Victor Emmanuel,' and\r\nembark upon some adventure of a republican complexion. He was also\r\nafraid that the Government of the Dictator would, by its\r\nunconventional methods, discredit the Italian cause in the eyes of\r\nEuropean statesmen. These reasons caused him to desire and to\r\nendeavour to bring about the immediate annexation of Sicily to the\r\nSardinian kingdom. On the other hand, Garibaldi's faith in Cavour had\r\nceased with the cession of Nice, and he believed him to be even now\r\ncontemplating the cession of the island of Sardinia as a further sop\r\nto Cerberus--a project which, if it existed nowhere else, did exist in\r\nthe mind of Napoleon III. With regard to immediate annexation, he had\r\nno intention of agreeing to it, and for one sufficing reason: had he\r\nconsented he could not have carried the war of liberation across the\r\nStraits of Messina. His Sicilian army must have laid down their arms\r\nat a command from Turin were it given. And it would have been given.\r\n\r\nLa Farina, like Crispi, a Sicilian by birth, arrived suddenly at\r\nPalermo, representing Cavour, as everyone thought, but in reality he\r\nrepresented himself. Strong-willed and prejudiced, he was, in his own\r\nway, a perfectly good patriot, and he had done all that was in his\r\npower (though not quite so much as in later years he fancied that he\r\nhad done) to aid and further the expedition of the Thousand. But he\r\ntried to force the annexation scheme by means so openly hostile to the\r\ngovernment of the day, that Garibaldi at length sent him on board\r\nPersano's flag-ship with a request that the admiral would forward him\r\nto Turin.\r\n\r\nAfter the evacuation of Messina by the royal troops, Garibaldi\r\nreceived persuasions of all sorts to let the kingdom of Naples alone.\r\nOn the part of King Francis an offer was made to him of 50,000,000\r\nfrancs and the Neapolitan navy in aid of a war for the liberation of\r\nVenice. Almost simultaneously he received a letter from Victor\r\nEmmanuel sent by the hand of Count Giulio Litta, in which the writer\r\nsaid that in the event of the King of Naples giving up Sicily 'I think\r\nthat our most reasonable course would be to renounce all ulterior\r\nundertakings against the Neapolitan kingdom.' This was the first\r\ndirect communication between the King and Garibaldi since the latter's\r\nlanding at Marsala; it is to be surmised that of indirect\r\ncommunications there had been several, and that they took the form of\r\nsubstantial assistance, sent, probably without Cavour being aware of\r\nit, for Victor Emmanuel carried on his own little conspiracies with a\r\nremarkable amount of secrecy. What induced him now to address words of\r\nrestraint to Garibaldi in the midway of his work, was the arrival of a\r\nletter from Napoleon III. in which the Emperor urged him in the\r\nstrongest manner to use his well-known personal influence with the\r\ngeneral to hold him back. It was not easy for Victor Emmanuel to\r\nrefuse point blank to make the last effort on behalf of his cousin.\r\nFrancis had appointed a constitutional ministry, promised a statute,\r\ngranted an amnesty and engaged to place himself in accord with the\r\nKing of Sardinia, adopted even the tricolor flag with the royal arms\r\nof Bourbon in the centre. Concessions idle as desperate on the 25th of\r\nJune 1860, the date which they bore. Their only consequence then was\r\nto facilitate the fall of the dynasty, the usual result of similar\r\ninspirations of the eleventh hour. Had all this been done on the day\r\nof the King's accession it might have imperilled Italian unity--not\r\nnow. But the fatal words, 'Too late,' would have fallen with ill grace\r\nfrom Victor Emmanuel's lips. Garibaldi answered his royal\r\ncorrespondent that when he had made him King of Italy he would be only\r\ntoo happy to obey him for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe King's letter, though delivered after the battle of Milazzo, was\r\nwritten before it. That event convinced Cavour, and doubtless the King\r\nwith him, that it was utterly impossible to arrest the tide at Cape\r\nFaro. It convinced him of a great deal more. He saw that if Piedmont\r\ncontinued much longer a passive spectator of the march of events, she\r\nwould lose the lead forever And he prepared to act.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile counsels reached Garibaldi from quite a different quarter\r\nnot to abandon Naples, but to go there from Rome instead of by\r\nCalabria. This daring scheme was favoured by Mazzini, Nicotera,\r\nBertani; indeed, by all the republicans. A corps of about 8000\r\nvolunteers was ready to start for a descent on the coast of the Papal\r\nStates. At present it was in the island of Sardinia, awaiting the\r\narrival of Garibaldi to assume the command. And now occurred\r\nGaribaldi's mysterious disappearance from Cape Faro, which at the time\r\nexcited endless curiosity. The truth was, that he actually went to\r\nSardinia, but instead of taking command of the volunteers bound for\r\nRome, he induced them to alter their plans and to join his Sicilian\r\narmy in the arduous undertaking before it of overthrowing the Bourbons\r\nin the Neapolitan kingdom. Thus he gained a reinforcement of which he\r\nknew the enormous need, for though he was willing to face\r\ndifficulties, he was not blind to them, as were many men of the\r\nextreme party. He also prevented what would have been a step of\r\nexceeding danger to the national cause, as it would have obliged the\r\nSardinian Government to break off all relations with Garibaldi and to\r\nuse force against the patriots in suppressing a movement which, if\r\nsuccessful, would have brought a hostile French army into Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF THE WATERS\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\nGaribaldi's March on Naples--The Piedmontese in Umbria and the\r\nMarches--The Volturno--Victor Emmanuel enters Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Italian kingdom is the fruit of the alliance between the strong\r\nmonarchical principles of Piedmont and the dissolvent forces of\r\nrevolution. Whenever either one side or the other, yielding to the\r\ninfluence of its individual sympathies or prejudices, failed to\r\nrecognise that thus only, by the essential logic of events, could the\r\nunity of the country be achieved, the entire edifice was placed in\r\ndanger of falling to the ground before it was completed.\r\n\r\nWhen Garibaldi stood on Cape Faro, conqueror and liberator, clothed in\r\na glory not that of Wellington or Moltke, but that of Arthur or Roland\r\nor the Cid Campeador; the subject of the gossip of the Arabs in their\r\ntents, of the wild horsemen of the Pampas, of the fishers in ice-bound\r\nseas; a solar myth, nevertheless certified to be alive in the\r\nnineteenth century--Cavour understood that if he were left much longer\r\nsingle occupant of the field, either he would rush to disaster, which\r\nwould be fatal to Italy, or he would become so powerful that, in the\r\nevent of his being plunged, willingly or unwillingly, by the more\r\nardent apostles of revolution into opposition with the King of\r\nSardinia, the issue of the contest would be by no means sure. To guard\r\nagainst both possibilities, Cavour decided to act, and to act at once.\r\nHe said of the conjuncture in which he was placed that it was not one\r\nof the most difficult, but the most difficult of his political life.\r\nBut he proved equal to the task, which does the more honour to his\r\nstatesmanship because his first plan failed completely. This plan was,\r\nthat the Neapolitan population should overthrow Francis II., and\r\nproclaim Victor Emmanuel their King before Garibaldi crossed the\r\nStraits. But the Neapolitans would not move hand or foot till\r\nGaribaldi was among them. The fact that when Cavour was convinced\r\nthat the Bourbon dynasty at Naples was about to fall, he tried to\r\nhasten its collapse by a few weeks or days, was made the most of by\r\nhis enemies as an example of base duplicity. At this distance of time,\r\nit need only be said that whether his conduct of affairs was\r\nscrupulous or unscrupulous, it deceived no one, for the Neapolitan\r\nKing and his friends were well convinced that the Filibuster of\r\nCaprera was their less deadly foe than the Prime Minister of Piedmont.\r\n\r\nBut of all the foes of Franceschiello, to use the diminutive by which,\r\nhalf in pity, half in contempt, the people of Naples remember him, the\r\nmost irrevocably fatal was himself. Two courses were open to him when,\r\nafter losing Sicily, he saw the loss of his other kingdom and of his\r\nthrone staring him in the face. One was to go forth like a man at the\r\nhead of his troops to meet the storm. There had been such a thing as\r\nloyalty in the Kingdom of Naples; not loyalty of the highest sort, but\r\nstill the sentiment had existed. Who knows what might not have been\r\nthe effect of the presence of their young Sovereign on the broken\r\n_moral_ of the Neapolitan soldiers? 'Sire, place yourself at the head\r\nof the 40,000 who remain, and risk a last stake, or, at least, fall\r\ngloriously after an honourable battle,' was the advice given him by\r\nhis minister of war, Pianell. But his stepmother or somebody\r\n(certainly not his wife) said that the sacred life of a king ought to\r\nbe kept in cotton wool, like other curiosities. Meanwhile his uncle,\r\nthe Count of Syracuse, proposed the other course which, though not\r\nheroic, would have been intelligible and even patriotic. This was to\r\nabsolve his subjects from their obedience, and embark on the first\r\navailable ship for foreign parts. Fitting the action to the word, the\r\nCount himself started for Turin. Francis awaited the doom of those\r\nwho only know how to take half measures.\r\n\r\nThe demoralisation, not only of the troops but of every branch of the\r\npublic administration in the kingdom of Naples, was not yet a\r\ncertified fact; and the enterprise which Garibaldi at Cape Faro had\r\nbefore him, of invading the dominions of a monarch who still had a\r\nlarge army, and whose subjects showed not the slightest visible sign\r\nof being disposed to strike a blow for their own freedom, looked\r\nrather fabulous than difficult. The only part of the _Regno_ where the\r\npeople were taking action was in the furthermost region of Calabria; a\r\nfortunate circumstance, since it was the first point to be attacked.\r\nCalabria, which had contributed its quota to the Thousand, contained\r\nmore patriotic energy than the rest of the _Regno_ put together. On\r\nthe 8th of August, Garibaldi sent over a small vanguard of 200 men\r\nunder a Calabrian officer, with the order to join the Calabrian band\r\nof insurgents which was hiding in the woods and gorges of Aspromonte,\r\nand to spread the news that his own coming would not be long delayed.\r\nThe Neapolitan generals had acquired the idea that, instead of these\r\nfew men, a large force had already disembarked, and so turned their\r\nattention to the mountains; while Garibaldi, after throwing the\r\nwar-ships in the Straits on an equally false scent by various\r\nintentionally abortive operations, crossed in the night of the 19th\r\nand effected a landing not far from Reggio, of which, for both moral\r\nand strategic reasons, it was of vital importance to gain possession\r\nas soon as possible. He took with him 4500 men, and had between 14,000\r\nand 15,000 more in readiness to follow. The royalist army in Calabria\r\nnumbered about 27,000, including the garrison of Reggio, 2000 men,\r\nunder the command of General Galotti. On the 20th, Bixio attacked the\r\noutposts; and on the 21st, Garibaldi fought his way into the\r\ncity--not, however, without meeting a strong resistance on the part of\r\nthe garrison, which might have been continued longer, and even with a\r\ndifferent result, had not the Calabrian insurgents hurried down from\r\nAspromonte on hearing the sound of guns, their sudden appearance\r\nmaking the Royalists think that they were being attacked on all sides.\r\nNext day the castle surrendered, and thus a quantity of valuable war\r\nmaterial fell into Garibaldi's hands. His luck had not deserted him.\r\n\r\nCosenz and Medici landed their divisions in the night of the 21st of\r\nAugust, near Scilla, in the neighbourhood of which General Briganti\r\nhad massed his Neapolitans, 7000 strong. On the 23rd, Briganti found\r\nhimself attacked on the south and north--from Scilla by Cosenz, and\r\nfrom Reggio by Garibaldi. His position was critical but not desperate\r\nhad he been able to depend upon his men, who were more numerous than\r\ntheir combined opponents; but he saw at once that fighting was the\r\nlast thing they meant to do, and he had no choice but to surrender at\r\ndiscretion, almost without firing a shot. Unfortunately, Garibaldi had\r\nno power to keep prisoners of war, even if he wished to do so. Who was\r\nto feed and guard them? Now, as subsequently, he bade the disbanded\r\ntroops go where they listed, undertaking to send to Naples by sea as\r\nmany as desired to go there. About a thousand accepted; the rest\r\ndispersed, forming the first nucleus of the semi-political and wholly\r\ndastardly brigandage which was later to become the scourge of Southern\r\nItaly. Their earliest exploit was the savage murder of General\r\nBriganti, whom they called a traitor, after the fashion of cowards.\r\nThis happened at Mileto on the 25th of August, when Briganti was on\r\nhis way to join General Ghio, who had concentrated 12,000 men on the\r\ntown of Monteleone. Garibaldi, whose sound principle it was to dispose\r\nof his enemies one by one as they cropped up, prepared to attack Ghio\r\nwith his whole available forces, but he was spared the trouble. He\r\ncame, he saw, and he had no need of conquering, for the soldiers of\r\nthat bad thing that had been Bourbon despotism in the Italian south\r\nvanished before his path more quickly than the mists of the morning\r\nbefore the sun. No grounds that will bear scrutiny have ever been\r\nadduced for the reactionary explanation of the marvel: to wit, that\r\nthe Neapolitan generals were bribed. By Cavour? The game would have\r\nbeen too risky. By 'English bank-notes,' that useful factor in\r\nEuropean politics that has every pleasing quality except reality? It\r\nis not apparent how the corruptibility of the generals gives a better\r\ncomplexion to the matter, but the writers on the subject who are\r\nfavourable to Francis II. seem to think that it does. Panic-stricken\r\nthese helpless Neapolitan officers may deserve to be called, but they\r\nwere not bought. And they had cause for panic with troops of whose\r\nuntrustworthiness they held the clearest proofs, and with the country\r\nup in arms against them; for a few days after the taking of Reggio\r\nthis was the case, and this was by far the greatest miracle operated\r\nby Garibaldi. The populations shook off their apathy, and not in\r\nCalabria only but in the Puglie, the Basilicata, the Abruzzi, there\r\nwas a sudden awakening as from a too long sleep. When Garibaldi got to\r\nMonteleone he found that Ghio had evacuated the town. He pursued him\r\nto Soveria, where, on the 30th of August, the 12,000 men laid down\r\ntheir arms. A few days later, another officer, General Caldarelli,\r\ncapitulated with 4000 men. Garibaldi's onward march was a perpetual\r\n_fête_; everywhere he was received with frantic demonstrations of\r\ndelight. Still there was one point between himself and the capital\r\nwhich might reasonably cause him some anxiety. There were 30,000 men\r\nmassed near Salerno, in positions of immense natural strength, where\r\nthey ought to have been able to stop the advance of an army twice the\r\nsize of Garibaldi's. How this obstacle was removed is far more\r\nsuggestive of a scene in a comic opera than of a page in history.\r\nColonel Peard, 'Garibaldi's Englishman,' went in advance of the army\r\nto Eboli, where he was mistaken, as commonly happened, for his chief.\r\nHe was past middle age; very tall, with a magnificent beard and a\r\nstern, dictatorial air, which answered admirably to the popular idea\r\nof what the conqueror of Sicily ought to be like, although there was\r\nno resemblance to the real person. It happened that Eboli was a\r\nroyalist town and beyond the pale of declared revolution--a placid and\r\nantiquated little city with a forgotten air, where life had been\r\nprobably too easy for its inhabitants to wish for a change. But the\r\nsupposed arrival of the Terrible Man turned everything upside-down.\r\nPeard, with Commander Forbes, who was following the campaign as a\r\nnon-combatant, rode up to the house of the old Syndic, who instantly\r\nbecame their devoted servant. Like wildfire spread the news--the whole\r\npopulation besieged the house, brass bands resounded, chinese lanterns\r\nwere hung out; the Church, led by the bishop, hurried to the spot, the\r\nLaw, headed by a judge, closely following, while the wives of the\r\nlocal officials appeared in perfectly new bonnets. They all craved an\r\naudience, and the same answer was given to all: that General\r\nGaribaldi was much fatigued and was asleep--so he was, but ninety\r\nmiles away. He would be pleased to receive the deputations if they\r\nwould return punctually at half-past three a.m. In the meantime, Peard\r\nwas in an inner room, engaged in cannonading Naples with telegrams. He\r\nhad sent for the telegraph master, who came trembling like an aspen,\r\nand from whom it was elicited that he had already telegraphed to the\r\nHome Office at Naples, and to the general commanding at Salerno, that\r\nGaribaldi was in the town. Peard remarked casually that he supposed he\r\nknew his life was in jeopardy, and then handed him the following\r\nmessage: 'Eboli, 11.30 p.m.--Garibaldi has arrived with 5000 of his\r\nown men, and 5000 Calabrese are momentarily expected. Disembarkations\r\nare expected in the bay of Naples and the gulf of Salerno to-night. I\r\nstrongly advise your withdrawing the garrison from the latter place\r\nwithout delay, or they will be cut off.' This was despatched to\r\nGeneral Ulloa, whom rumour reported to have been just made minister of\r\nwar, and was signed in the name of one of his personal friends. The\r\nrumour was false; but the telegram, of course, reached the desired\r\nquarter, and the name attached removed all doubt of its genuineness.\r\nIt was hardly sent off when a despatch came from the real war\r\nminister, asking the telegraph clerk if news had been received of the\r\ndivision Caldarelli? To this Peard answered that General Caldarelli\r\nand his division had gone over to Garibaldi yesterday, and now formed\r\npart of the national army. Similar information was sent to General\r\nScotti at Salerno. Finally, the Syndic of Salerno was asked if he had\r\nseen anything of the Garibaldian expeditions by sea?\r\n\r\nSatisfied with his work, Colonel Peard, who knew that there were\r\nNeapolitan troops within four miles of Eboli, and who did not think\r\nthat things looked entirely reassuring, decided to beat a somewhat\r\nprecipitous retreat. He told the Syndic that he was going to\r\nreconnoitre in the direction of Salerno, and that his departure must\r\nbe kept a dead secret, but as soon as he was out of the town he turned\r\nthe horses' heads backwards towards the Garibaldian lines. He was\r\nstill accompanied by Commander Forbes, to whom, during their midnight\r\ndrive, he related his performance on the telegraph wires. 'What on\r\nearth is the good of all this?' said Forbes; 'you don't imagine they\r\nwill be fools enough to believe it?' 'You will see,' answered the\r\ncolonel, 'it will frighten them to death, and to-morrow they will\r\nevacuate Salerno.' And, in fact, at four o'clock in the morning the\r\nevacuation was begun in obedience to telegraphic orders from Naples.\r\n\r\nThe 30,000 men recalled from Salerno and the adjacent districts\r\nmarched towards Capua. The river Volturno, which runs by that\r\nfortified town, was now chosen as the line of defence of the Bourbon\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of September the King and Queen with the Austrian,\r\nPrussian, Bavarian and Spanish ministers, left Naples for Gaeta on\r\nboard a Spanish man-of-war. The King issued a proclamation of which\r\nthe language was dignified and even pathetic: it is believed to have\r\nbeen written by Liborio Romano, the Prime Minister, who was at the\r\nsame moment betraying his master. Be that as it may, the King's\r\nfarewell to his subjects and fellow-citizens might have touched hearts\r\nof stone could they but have forgotten the record of the hundred and\r\ntwenty-six years of rule to which he fondly alluded. As it was, in the\r\nvast crowds that watched him go, there was not found a man who said,\r\n'God bless him;' not a woman who shed a tear. Had any one of the\r\nbullets aimed at Ferdinand II. taken fatal effect, it would have been\r\na less striking punishment for his political sins than this leaden\r\nweight of indifference which descended on his son.\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Proclamation Francis II. stated that he had adhered to\r\nthe great principles of Italian nationality, and had irrevocably\r\nsurrounded his throne with free institutions; nevertheless it is\r\nalleged on what seems good authority that in those last days he veered\r\nround to the party of the Queen Dowager, who was doing all she could\r\nto provoke the lazzaroni to reaction. It was also believed at Naples\r\nthat he left orders for Castel Sant' Elmo to bombard the town if\r\nGaribaldi entered.\r\n\r\nThe Dictator was so much pleased with Colonel Peard's telegraphic\r\nfeats at Eboli, that he sent him on to Salerno to repeat the farce.\r\nPeard's despatches determined the departure of the Court, and it was\r\nto him (in the belief that he was Garibaldi) that Liborio Romano,\r\nthree hours before the King embarked, addressed the celebrated\r\ntelegram invoking the 'most desired presence' of the Dictator in\r\nNaples. With this document in his hand, Peard went out with the\r\nNational Guard to meet the real Garibaldi who was on his way from\r\nAuletta. The Dictator hailed his double with the cry of 'Viva\r\nGaribaldi,' in which Cosenz and the other officers cordially joined.\r\nThe entry of the Liberator into Salerno was greeted with the wildest\r\nenthusiasm, the wonderful beauty of the surroundings seeming a fitting\r\nsetting for a scene like the vision of some freedom-loving poet.\r\n\r\nNext morning at half-past nine, Garibaldi, with thirteen of his staff,\r\nstarted by special train for the capital.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that though the army of Salerno was recalled to\r\nthe Volturno, no troops had been withdrawn from Naples. The sentries\r\nstill paced before the palaces and public offices, the barracks held\r\ntheir full complement, Castel Sant' Elmo had all its guns in position.\r\nThese troops quartered in the capital, where everything contributed to\r\nstimulate their fidelity, were of different stuff from Ghio's or\r\nCaldarelli's frightened sheep; a White Terror, a repetition of the\r\n15th of May 1848, would have been much to their mind. There had been\r\nno actual revolution; nothing officially proved that Naples had thrown\r\noff the royal allegiance. Such were the strange circumstances under\r\nwhich Garibaldi, without a single battalion, came to take possession\r\nof a city of 300,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nCourage of this sort either does not exist, or it is supremely\r\nunconscious. It is likely, therefore, that the Dictator gave no\r\nthought to the enormous risk he ran, but his passage from the station\r\nto the palace of the Foresteria, where he descended, was a bad\r\nquarter-of-an-hour to the friends who followed him, and to whom his\r\nlife seemed the point on which Italian regeneration yet hung. A chance\r\nshot fired by some Royalist fanatic, and who could measure the result?\r\nAs he passed under the muzzle of the guns at the opening of the\r\nToledo, he gave the order: 'Drive slower, slower--more slowly still.'\r\nAnd he rose and stood up for a moment in the carriage with his arms\r\ncrossed. The artillerymen, who had begun to make a kind of hostile\r\ndemonstration, changed their minds and saluted. The sullen looks of\r\nthe royal soldiers was the only jarring note in the display of\r\nintoxicating joy with which the Neapolitans welcomed the bringer of\r\ntheir freedom; freedom all too easily had, for if anything could have\r\npurified the Neapolitans from the evil influences of servitude, it\r\nwould have been the necessity of paying dearly for their liberties.\r\nThe delirium in the streets lasted for several days and nights; what\r\nthe consequences would have been of such a state of madness under a\r\npaler sky, it is not pleasant to reflect; here, at least, there were\r\nno robberies, no drunken person was seen; if there were some murders,\r\na careful inquiry made by an Englishman showed that the number was the\r\nsame as the average number of street-murders through the year. At\r\nnight, when the word passed 'Il Dittatore dorme,' it was enough to\r\nclear the streets as if by magic near the palace (a private one) where\r\nin a sixth floor room the idol of the hour slept. The National Guard,\r\nwho were the sole guardians of order, behaved admirably.\r\n\r\nFor a few days such of the townsfolk as had not completely lost their\r\nheads, underwent acute anxiety as they gazed at the frowning pile of\r\nSant' Elmo; but finally the officers in command of the garrison\r\ndecided to capitulate, contrary, in this instance, to the wishes of\r\nthe soldiery. The royal troops marched out of the city towards Capua\r\non the 11th of September.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi's first act had been to hand over the Neapolitan fleet in\r\nthe bay to Admiral Persano, a solemn reassertion of his loyalty to\r\nVictor Emmanuel, whom, in his every utterance, he held up to the\r\npeople as the best of kings and the father of his country. He\r\ninstructed his Neapolitan officer, Cosenz, to form a ministry, and\r\nwrote to the Marquis Pallavicini, the prisoner of Spielberg, inviting\r\nhim to become Pro-Dictator. Had a man of authority like Pallavicini,\r\nwho also entirely possessed the Dictator's confidence, at once assumed\r\nthat office, much of the friction which followed might have been\r\nspared. But he did not enter into his functions till October, and in\r\nthe meanwhile the 'dualism' of Sicily broke out in an exaggerated\r\nform, each side sincerely believing the other to be on the verge of\r\nruining the country to which they were both sincerely attached. The\r\nappointment of Dr Bertani as Secretary of the Dictatorship gave rise\r\nto controversies which even now, when the grave has closed over the\r\nactors, are hardly at rest. It is time that they should be. Apart from\r\nthe war about persons, some of them not very wise persons, and apart\r\nfrom the fears entertained at Turin, that the freeing of the Two\r\nSicilies would drift into a republican movement: fears which were\r\ninvincible, though, as far as they regarded Garibaldi, they were\r\nneither just nor generous, the question resolved itself, as was the\r\ncase in Sicily, into whether the unification of Italy was to go on or\r\nwhether it was to halt? Garibaldi refused to give up Sicily to the\r\nKing's government because he intended making it the base for the\r\nliberation of Naples. Events had justified him. He now refused to hand\r\nover Naples because he intended making it the base for the liberation\r\nof Rome. It has been seen that he and he alone prevented an attempt at\r\na landing in the Papal states from being made in the month of August.\r\nIn deciding, however, that it was expedient to finish one enterprise\r\nbefore beginning another, he did not give up Rome: he merely chose\r\nwhat he thought a safer road to go there. And he now declared without\r\nthe least concealment that he intended to proclaim Victor Emmanuel\r\nKing of Italy from the Quirinal.\r\n\r\nWould events have justified him again? There was a French garrison in\r\nRome; this, to Cavour, seemed a conclusive answer.\r\n\r\nCavour was engaged on a series of measures, unscrupulous manoeuvres as\r\nsome have called them, masterpieces of statesmanship as they have been\r\ndescribed by others, by which he got back the reins of the Italian\r\nteam into his own hands. The plan of an annexionist revolution in\r\nNaples before Garibaldi arrived had failed. So much discontent was\r\nfelt at the apparent indifference, or, at least, 'masterly inactivity'\r\nof the Sardinian government in presence of the great struggle in the\r\nsouth that Cavour began to be afraid of a revolution breaking out in\r\nquite a different quarter, in Victor Emmanuel's own kingdom. It was at\r\nthis critical juncture that he resolved to invade the Papal states,\r\nand take possession of the Province of Umbria and the Marches of\r\nAncona.\r\n\r\nThe decision was one of extreme boldness. For three months Cavour had\r\nbeen stormed at by all the Foreign Ministers in Turin, excepting Sir\r\nJames Hudson, but, as he wrote to the Marquis E. D'Azeglio: 'I shall\r\nnot draw back save before fleets and armies.'\r\n\r\nAustria, France, Spain, Russia and Prussia now broke off diplomatic\r\nrelations with Sardinia. What would be their next act? The danger of\r\nAustria intervening was smaller than it then appeared; Austria was too\r\nmuch embarrassed in her own house, and especially in Hungary, for her\r\nto covet adventures in Italy. But the French Government did, in the\r\nplainest terms, threaten to intervene, and this notwithstanding that\r\nthe Emperor himself appeared to be convinced by Cavour's argument,\r\nthat the proposed scheme was the only means of checking the march of\r\nrevolution, which from Rome might spread to Paris. By announcing one\r\nline of policy in public and another in private, Napoleon left the\r\ndoor open to adopt either one or the other, according to the\r\ndevelopment of events. In the sequel, the Papal party had a right to\r\nsay that he lured them to their destruction, as their plan of\r\noperations, and in particular the defence of Ancona, was undertaken in\r\nthe distinct expectation of being supported by the French fleet.\r\n\r\nAs early as April 1860, the Pope invited the Orleanist General\r\nLamoricière to organise and command the forces for the defence of the\r\nTemporal Power, which he had summoned from the four quarters of the\r\nCatholic world. 5000 men, more or less, answered the call; they came\r\nchiefly from France, Belgium and Ireland. Of his own subjects the Pope\r\nhad 10,000 under arms. In a proclamation, issued on assuming the\r\ncommand, Lamoricière compared the Italian movement with Islamism, a\r\ncomparison which aroused intense exasperation in Italy, where the\r\nrally of a foreign crusade against the object which was nearest to\r\nItalian hearts, and for which so many of the best Italians had\r\nsuffered and died, could not but call up feelings which in their turn\r\nwere expressed in no moderate language. It was a fresh illustration of\r\nthe old truth--that the Papal throne existed only by force of foreign\r\narms, foreign influence. Lamoricière's 'mercenaries' did much harm to\r\nthe Pope's cause by bringing home this truth once more to the minds of\r\nall. That the corps contained some of the bluest blood of France, that\r\nthere were good young men in it, who thought heaven the sure reward\r\nfor death in defence of dominions painfully added in the course of\r\ncenturies by devices not heavenly to the original patrimony of Peter,\r\ndid not and could not reconcile the Italians to the defiance thrown\r\ndown to them by a band of strangers in their own country.\r\n\r\nBefore the opening of hostilities, Victor Emmanuel offered Pius IX. to\r\nassume the administration of the Papal states (barring Rome) while\r\nleaving the nominal sovereignty to the Pope. Nothing came of the\r\nproposal, which was followed by a formal demand for the dissolution of\r\nLamoricière's army, and an intimation that the Sardinian troops would\r\nintervene were force used to put down risings within the Papal border.\r\nOn the 11th of September, symptoms of revolution having meanwhile\r\nbroken out in the Marches, General Fanti in command of 35,000 men\r\ncrossed the frontier. Half these forces under Fanti himself were\r\ndirected on Perugia; the other half under Cialdini marched towards\r\nAncona. The garrisons of Perugia and Spoleto were compelled to\r\nsurrender, and Lamoricière found his communications cut off, so that\r\nhe could only reach the last fortress in the power of the Papal\r\ntroops, Ancona, by fighting his way through Cialdini's division, which\r\nby rapid marches had reached the heights of Castelfidardo. His men\r\npassed the day of the 17th in religious exercises, and in going to\r\nconfession; the vicinity of the Holy House of Loreto, brought hither\r\nby angels from Bethlehem, filled the young Breton soldiers with\r\ntransports of religious fervour. Lamoricière had taken from the Santa\r\nCasa some of the flags of the victors of Lepanto to wave over his\r\ncolumns. In the battle of the next day the French fought with the\r\ngallantry of the Vendéans whose descendants they were, and the Irish\r\nbehaved as Irishmen generally behave under fire, but the Swiss and\r\nRomans mostly fought ill or not at all. Lamoricière excused the\r\nconduct of the latter on the ground that they were young troops; it is\r\nlikely that they had but little eagerness to fire on their\r\nfellow-countrymen. Being Italians, and above all being Romans, they\r\nassuredly were not sustained by one scrap of the mystical enthusiasm\r\nof the French: such a state of mind would have been incomprehensible\r\nto them. They knew that so far as dogmas went Victor Emmanuel was as\r\ngood a Catholic as the Pope. It is surprising that with part of his\r\nforce demoralised Lamoricière was still able to hold his own for three\r\nor four hours. General Pimodan and many of the French officers were\r\nkilled; Lamoricière could say truly: 'All the best names of France are\r\nleft on the battlefield.'\r\n\r\nAfter the victory of Castelfidardo, the Sardinian attack was\r\nconcentrated on Ancona. Admiral Persano brought the squadron from\r\nNaples to co-operate with Fanti's land forces, and the fortress\r\ncapitulated on the 29th of September. The campaign had lasted eighteen\r\ndays. The Piedmontese held Umbria and the Marches, and a road was thus\r\nopened for the army of Victor Emmanuel to march to Naples. During the\r\nprogress of these events Garibaldi was preparing for the final\r\nstruggle on the Volturno. He had not yet given up the hope of carrying\r\nhis victorious arms to the Capitol, and from the Capitol to the Square\r\nof St Mark. The whole republican party, and Mazzini himself, who had\r\narrived in Naples, ardently adhered to this programme. Their argument\r\nwas not without force, risk or no risk, when would there be another\r\nopportunity as good as the present? It was very well for Cavour to\r\nlook forward, as he did to the day of his death, to a pacific solution\r\nof the Roman question; Mazzini saw--in which he was far more\r\nclear-sighted than Cavour--that such a solution would never take\r\nplace. His arrival at Naples caused alarm at Turin, both on account of\r\nhis presumed influence over Garibaldi, the extent of which was much\r\nexaggerated, and from the terror his name spread among European\r\ndiplomatists. The Dictator was asked to proscribe the man whose latest\r\nact had been to give the last 30,000 francs he possessed in the world\r\nto the expenses of the Calabrian campaign. He refused to do this. 'How\r\ncould I have insisted upon sending Mazzini into exile when he has done\r\nso much for Italian unity?' he said afterwards to Victor Emmanuel, who\r\nagreed that he was right. However, he allowed the Pro-Dictator\r\nPallavicini to write a letter to Mazzini, inviting him to show his\r\ngenerosity by spontaneously leaving Naples in order to remove the\r\nunjust fears occasioned by his presence. Mazzini replied, as he had a\r\nperfect right to do, that every citizen is entitled to remain in a\r\nfree country as long as he does not break the laws. And so the\r\nincident closed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Party of Action urged Garibaldi not to give up Rome, other\r\ninfluences were brought to bear on him in the opposite sense, and\r\nespecially that of the English Government, which instructed Admiral\r\nMundy to arrange a 'chance' meeting between the Dictator and the\r\nEnglish Minister at Naples, Mr. Elliot, on board the flagship\r\n_Hannibal_. Mr. Elliot pointed out the likelihood of a European war\r\narising from an attack on Venice, and the certainty of French\r\nintervention in case of a revolutionary dash on Rome. Garibaldi\r\nreplied that Rome was an Italian city, and that neither the Emperor\r\nnor anyone else had a right to keep him out of it. 'He was evidently,'\r\nwrites Admiral Mundy in reporting the interview, 'not to be swayed by\r\nany dictates of prudence.'\r\n\r\nIn Sicily, the rival factions were bringing about a state approaching\r\nanarchy, but a flying visit from Garibaldi in the middle of September\r\naverted the storm. At this time, Garibaldi's headquarters were at\r\nCaserta, in the vast palace where Ferdinand II. breathed his last. The\r\nGaribaldian and the Royal armies lay face to face with one another,\r\nand each was engaged in completing its preparations. It might have\r\nbeen expected, and for a moment it seems that Garibaldi did expect,\r\nthat after the solemn collapse of the Neapolitan army south of Naples,\r\nthe comedy was now only awaiting its final act and the fall of the\r\ncurtain. But it soon became apparent that, instead of the last act of\r\na comedy, the next might be the first of a tragedy. The troops\r\nconcentrated on the right bank of the Volturno amounted to 35,000,\r\nwith 6000 garrisoning Capua. About 15,000 more formed the reserves and\r\nthe garrison of Gaeta. The position on the Volturno was favourable to\r\nthe Royalists; the fortress of Capua on the left bank gave them a free\r\npassage to and fro, while the Volturno, which is rather wide and very\r\ndeep, formed a grave impediment to the advance of their opponents. But\r\nthe chief reason why there was a serious possibility of the fortunes\r\nof war being reversed, lay in the fact that the _moral_ of these\r\ntroops was good. All the picked regiments of the army were here,\r\nincluding 2500 cavalry. The men were ashamed of the stampede from the\r\nsouth, and were sincerely anxious to take their revenge. Thus the\r\nNeapolitan plan of a pitched battle and a victorious march on Naples\r\nwas by no means foredoomed, on the face of things, to failure.\r\n\r\nIn Garibaldi's short absence at Palermo, the Southern Army (as he now\r\ncalled his forces) was left under the command of the Hungarian General\r\nTürr, as brave an officer as ever lived, and a fast friend to Italy,\r\nbut his merits do not undo the fact that as soon as the Dictator's\r\nback was turned, everything got into a muddle. Pontoon bridges had\r\nbeen thrown across the river at four points; availing himself of one\r\nof these, Türr crossed the Volturno with a view to taking up a\r\nposition on the right bank at a place called Caiazzo, a step which, if\r\nattempted at all, ought to have been supported by a very strong force.\r\nOn the 19th of September, Caiazzo was actually taken, but on the 21st\r\nthe Royalists came out of Capua with 3000 men and defeated with great\r\nloss the thousand or fewer Garibaldians charged with its defence, only\r\na small number of whom were able to recross the bridges and join their\r\ncompanions. The saddest part of this adventure was the slaughter of\r\nnearly the whole of the boys' company--lads under fifteen, who had run\r\naway from home or school to fight with Garibaldi. Fight they did for\r\nfive mortal hours, with the heroism of veterans or of children. Only\r\nabout twenty were left.\r\n\r\nWhen Garibaldi returned from Sicily, this was the first news he heard,\r\nand it was not cheering. The Royalists, who thought they had won\r\nanother Waterloo, were in the wildest spirits, and the march on Naples\r\nwas talked of in their camp as being as good as accomplished.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi's lines were spread in the shape of a semi-circle, of which\r\nthe two ends started from Santa Maria on the left, and Maddaloni on\r\nthe right, with Castel Morone at the apex. The country is hilly, and\r\nthis fact, together with the great distance covered, divided the\r\n20,000 men into a number of practically distinct bodies, each of\r\nwhich, in the decisive battle, had to fight its own fight. Here and\r\nthere improvised fortifications were thrown up. Garibaldi was aware\r\nthat his line of battle was perilously extended, but the necessity of\r\nblocking all the roads and by-ways which led to Naples, dictated\r\ntactics which he was the last to defend.\r\n\r\nThe best policy for the Royalists would have been to bring\r\noverwhelming numbers to bear on a single point, and, breaking the\r\nline, to march straight on the capital. They were doubtless afraid of\r\nan advance which would have left a portion of the Garibaldian army\r\nunbeaten in their rear. Nevertheless, of the chances that remained to\r\nthem, this was the best. At Naples there were no Garibaldian troops to\r\nspeak of, and the powers of reaction had been working night and day to\r\nprocure for the rightful King the reception due to a saviour of\r\nsociety. Perhaps they would not have completely failed. There were\r\nnobles who were sulking, shopkeepers who were frightened,\r\nprofessional beggars with whom the Dictator had opened a fierce but\r\nunequal contest, for no blue-bottle fly is more difficult to tackle\r\nthan a genuine Neapolitan mendicant; there were priests who, though\r\nnot by any means all unpatriotic, were beginning to be scared by\r\nGaribaldi's gift of a piece of land for the erection of an English\r\nchurch, and by the sale of Diodati's Bible in the streets. And\r\nfinally, there was the Carrozzella driver whom a Garibaldian officer\r\nhad struck because he beat his horse. These individuals formed a\r\nnucleus respectably numerous, if not otherwise respectable, of anxious\r\nwatchers for the Happy Return.\r\n\r\nIf anyone question the fairness of this catalogue of the partisans of\r\nthe fallen dynasty, the answer is, that had their ranks contained\r\nworthier elements, they would not have carefully reserved the\r\ndemonstration of their allegiance till the King should prove that he\r\nhad the right of the strongest.\r\n\r\nTowards five o'clock in the morning of the 1st of October, the\r\nroyalists, who crossed the river in three columns, fired the first\r\nshots, and the fight soon became general. King Francis had come from\r\nGaeta to Capua to witness what was meant to be an auspicious\r\ncelebration of his birthday. General Ritucci held the chief command.\r\nOf the Garibaldians, Milbitz and Medici commanded the left wing (Santa\r\nMaria and Sant' Angelo), and Bixio the right (Maddaloni), while Castel\r\nMorone, through which a road led to Caserta, was entrusted to Colonel\r\nPilade Bronzetti and three hundred picked volunteers. Garibaldi's own\r\nheadquarters was with the reserves at Caserta, but he appeared, as if\r\nby magic, at all parts of the line during the day, sometimes bringing\r\nup reinforcements, sometimes almost alone, always arriving at the\r\nnick of time whenever things looked serious, to help, direct and\r\nreanimate the men. A dozen times in these journeys by the rugged\r\nmountain paths he narrowly escaped falling into the enemy's hands. No\r\ntrace of uneasiness was visible on his placid face; there was,\r\nhowever, more than enough to make a man uneasy. In the early part of\r\nthe battle, both Medici and Bixio were pushed back from their\r\npositions. Only Pilade Bronzetti with his handful of Lombard\r\nBersaglieri never swerved, and held in check an entire Neapolitan\r\ncolumn, whose commander (Perrone) has been blamed for wasting so much\r\ntime in trying to take that position instead of joining his 2000 men\r\nto the troops attacking Bixio, but his object was to march on Caserta,\r\nwhere his appearance might have caused very serious embarrassment.\r\n\r\nUp to midday the Royalists advanced, not fast, indeed, but surely.\r\nThey fired all the buildings on their path, and amongst others one in\r\nwhich there were thirty wounded Garibaldians who were burned to death.\r\nIt was said to be an accident, but such accidents had better not\r\nhappen. Victory seemed assured to them. It is not disputed that on\r\nthis occasion they fought well, and they had all the advantages of\r\nground, numbers and artillery. But the volunteers, also, were at their\r\nbest; they surpassed themselves. If every man of them had not shown\r\nthe best military qualities, skill, resource, the power of recovery,\r\nFrancis II. would have slept that night at Naples.\r\n\r\nMedici acted with splendid firmness, but at the most critical moment\r\nhe had Garibaldi by his side. Bixio was left to fight his separate\r\nbattle unaided (so great was the chief's confidence in him), and\r\nconsummately well he fought it. After the middle of the day, the\r\nGaribaldians began to retake their positions, and at some points to\r\nassume the offensive; still it was five o'clock before Garibaldi could\r\nsend his famous despatch to Naples: 'Victory along all the line.' The\r\nbattle had lasted ten hours.\r\n\r\nThe Sicilians and Calabrese under Dunne, who stemmed the first onset\r\nat Casa Brucciata, and under Eber, whose desperate charge at Porta\r\nCapua ushered in the changing fortunes of the day, rivalled the North\r\nItalians in steadiness and in dash. The French company and the\r\nHungarian Legion covered themselves with glory; it was a pity there\r\nwas not the English brigade, 600 strong, which mismanaged to arrive at\r\nNaples the day after the fair. Had they been in time for the fight,\r\nthey would doubtless have left a brighter record than the only one\r\nwhich they did leave: that of being out of place in a country where\r\nwine was cheap.\r\n\r\nPutting aside Dunne and a few other English officers, England was\r\nrepresented on the Volturno by three or four Royal Marines who had\r\nslipped away from their ship, the _Renown_, and were come over to see\r\nthe 'fun.' It seems that they did ask for rifles, but they did not get\r\nthem, their martial deeds consisting in the help they gave in dragging\r\noff two captured field-pieces. Never did an exploit cause so much\r\ndiscussion in proportion with its importance; the Neapolitan Minister\r\nin London informed Lord John Russell that a body of armed men from the\r\nBritish fleet had been sent by Admiral Mundy to serve pieces of\r\nGaribaldian artillery.\r\n\r\nOf all the striking incidents of the day, that which should be\r\nremembered while Italy endures, was the defence of the hillock of\r\nCastel Morone by Bronzetti and his Lombards. Their invincible courage\r\ncontributed in no small degree to the final result. One man to eight,\r\nthey held their own for ten hours; when summoned to yield by the\r\nNeapolitan officer, who could not help admiring his courage, Pilade\r\nBronzetti replied: 'Soldiers of liberty never surrender!' It was only\r\nin the moment of victory that Perrone passed over their dead bodies\r\nand uselessly advanced--which cost him dear on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe Garibaldian losses were 2000 killed and wounded and 150 prisoners;\r\nthe Neapolitans had the same number placed _hors de combat_, and lost\r\n3000 prisoners.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi had none but his own men; the report that the battle had\r\nbeen won by soldiers of the Sardinian army who arrived in the\r\nafternoon was false, because they did not arrive till next day, when a\r\nbattalion of Piedmontese Bersaglieri took part in defeating Perrone's\r\ncolumn, which (it is hard to say with what idea) descended nearly to\r\nCaserta, as its commander wished to do on the first. Did Perrone not\r\nknow of the defeat of yesterday? His column was surrounded and all the\r\nmen were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of the Volturno the belligerents re-occupied the\r\npositions on the right and left banks of that river which they held\r\nbefore. Military critics speculate as to why Garibaldi did not follow\r\nup his advantage, and the opinion seems general that he did not feel\r\nhimself strong enough to do so. The fortress of Capua was a serious\r\nobstacle, but Garibaldi was not accustomed to attach much weight to\r\nobstacles whatever they were, and it is pretty certain that he would\r\nhave gone in pursuit had he not received a letter from Victor\r\nEmmanuel, who bade him wait till he came.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had abandoned all thoughts of marching on Rome. From\r\nthe moment that the King's army started for Naples he understood that\r\npersistence in the Roman programme would lead to something graver than\r\na war of words with the authorities at Turin. Always positive, he\r\ngathered some consolation from the gain to Italy of two Roman\r\nprovinces, Umbria and the Marches, and trusted the future with the\r\nlarger hope.\r\n\r\nConstitutional government triumphed over the old absolutism and over\r\nthe new dictatorship. And here it may be noted which Constitutional\r\ngovernment, which never had a more sincere and faithful votary than\r\nCavour, found no favour with Garibaldi at any period of his life. Its\r\nhampering restrictions, its slow processes, irritated his mind,\r\nintolerant of constraint, and he failed to see that this cumbersome\r\nmechanism still gives the best, if not the only, guarantee for the\r\nmaintenance of freedom. The sudden transition of Southern Italy from a\r\ncorrupt despotism to free institutions brought with it a train of\r\nevils, but there was no alternative. If Italy was to be one, all parts\r\nof it must be placed under the same laws, and that at once.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of October the Sardinian parliament sitting at Turin\r\npassed all but unanimously the motion authorising the King's\r\nGovernment to accept the annexation of those Italian provinces which\r\nmanifested, by universal suffrage, their desire to form part of the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy. Cavour's speech on this occasion was\r\nmemorable: 'Rome,' he said, 'would inevitably become the splendid\r\ncapital of the Italian kingdom, but that great result would be reached\r\nby means of moral force; it was impossible that enlightened Catholics\r\nshould not end by recognising that the Head of Catholicism would\r\nexercise his high office with truer freedom and independence guarded\r\nby the love and respect of 22,000,000 Italians than entrenched behind\r\n25,000 bayonets.' Of Venice, the martyr-city, he said 'that public\r\nopinion was rapidly turning against its retention by Austria, and that\r\nwhen the great majority of Germans refused to be any longer\r\naccomplices in its subjection, that subjection would be brought to a\r\nclose either by force of arms or by pacific negotiations.'\r\n\r\nThe words were strangely prescient at a time when the Prince Regent of\r\nPrussia was making most melancholy wails over the fall of the\r\nNeapolitan King. The Prussian Government issued a formal protest,\r\nwhich Cavour met by observing that Prussia, of all Powers, had the\r\nleast reason to object, as Piedmont was simply setting her an example\r\nwhich she ought to follow and would follow, the mission of the two\r\nnations being identical. He already thought of Prussia as an ally:\r\n'Never more French alliances,' he was once heard to say.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the 11th of October, Victor Emmanuel crossed the\r\nNeapolitan frontier at the head of the army which Cialdini led to\r\nvictory at Castelfidardo. The King published a proclamation, in which\r\nhe said that he closed the era of revolution in Italy. Other bodies of\r\nPiedmontese troops had been despatched by sea to Naples and\r\nManfredonia. The passage of the Piedmontese troops over the Abruzzi\r\nmountains was opposed both by a division of the Bourbon army and by\r\narmed peasants, who burnt a man alive at a place called Isernia; but\r\ntheir advance was not long delayed.\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitans now began to retire from the right bank of the\r\nVolturno, and retreat towards the Garigliano, their last line of\r\ndefence. Garibaldi crossed the river with 5000 men, and moved in the\r\ndirection by which the vanguard of the Piedmontese was expected to\r\narrive. At daybreak on the 26th of October, near Teano, the\r\nPiedmontese came in sight. Garibaldi, who had dismounted, walked up\r\nto Victor Emmanuel and said: 'Hail, King of Italy!'\r\n\r\nOnce before the title was given to a prince of the House of Savoy--to\r\nCharles Albert, in the bitterest irony by the Austrian officers who\r\nsaw him flying from his friends and country by order of his implacable\r\nuncle. A change had come since then.\r\n\r\nVictor Emmanuel answered simply: 'Thanks,' and remained talking for a\r\nquarter of an hour in the particularly kind and affectionate manner he\r\nused with Garibaldi, but at the end of the interview, when the leader\r\nof the volunteers asked that in the imminent battle on the Garigliano\r\nthey might have the honour of occupying the front line, he received\r\nthe reply: 'Your troops are tired, mine are fresh, it is my turn now.'\r\n\r\nGaribaldi said sadly that evening to an English friend: 'They have\r\nsent us to the rear.' It was the first sign of the ungenerous\r\ntreatment meted out to the Garibaldian array to which the King lent\r\nhimself more than he ought to have done. He promised to be present on\r\nthe 6th of November, when Garibaldi reviewed his volunteers, but after\r\nkeeping them waiting, sent a message to say that he could not come.\r\nThe last meeting of all between the chief and his faithful followers\r\nwas at Naples, on the occasion of the distribution of medals to as\r\nmany as were left of the Thousand--less than half. In all his farewell\r\naddresses the same note sounded: 'We have done much in a short\r\ntime.... I thank you in the name of our country.... We shall meet\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nThe plebiscites in Umbria and the Marches and in the kingdoms of\r\nNaples and Sicily took place in October. The formula adopted at Naples\r\nwas more broadly framed than in the previous plebiscites; it ran:\r\n'The people desire an united Italy under the sceptre of the House of\r\nSavoy.' The vote was almost unanimous.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of November, Victor Emmanuel made his entry into Naples,\r\nwith Garibaldi at his side. Next day, in the great throne-room of the\r\npalace, the king-maker delivered to the King the plebiscites of the\r\nTwo Sicilies.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi had nothing more to do except to pay a last visit to Admiral\r\nMundy, whose flagship still lay at anchor in the bay. This duty was\r\nperformed in the grey dawn of the 9th of November. 'There is the ship\r\nwhich is to carry me away to my island home,' he said, pointing to an\r\nAmerican merchant vessel, 'but, Admiral, I could not depart without\r\npaying you a farewell visit. Your conduct to me since our first\r\nmeeting at Palermo has been so kind, so generous, that it can never be\r\nerased from my memory; it is engraven there indelibly--it will last my\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\nOn leaving the flagship he rowed straight to the American vessel,\r\nwhich soon afterwards steamed out of the bay. The parting salute fired\r\nby the guns of the _Hannibal_ was all the pomp that attended his\r\ndeparture. Several hours later the people of Naples knew that their\r\nliberator had gone to dig up the potatoes which he had planted in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nBy Cavour's advice, Victor Emmanuel offered Garibaldi a dukedom and\r\nthe Collar of the Annunziata, which confers the rank of cousin to the\r\nKing, besides riches to support these honours. He refused everything,\r\nand returned to Caprera poorer than when he left it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF THE ITALIAN KINGDOM\r\n\r\n1860-1861\r\n\r\nBeginnings of the Italian Kingdom--The Fall of Gaeta--Political\r\nBrigandage--The Proclamation of the Italian Kingdom--Cavour's Death.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neapolitan army retreated, as has been already stated, beyond the\r\nGarigliano. Capua, isolated and surrounded, could render no material\r\nservice to the royal cause; it capitulated on the 2nd of November,\r\nthough not until the town had been bombarded for forty-eight hours.\r\nThe siege was witnessed by Victor Emmanuel, who said to General Delia\r\nRocca: 'It breaks my heart to think that we are sending death and\r\ndestruction into an Italian town.' Two days after the surrender of\r\nCapua, Cialdini threw a bridge over the Garigliano near its mouth, an\r\noperation covered by the guns of Admiral Persano's squadron. His first\r\nattempt on the 29th of October had met with a decided repulse, another\r\nproof that this last remnant of the Neapolitan army was not an enemy\r\nto be despised. The second attempt, however, was successful; part of\r\nthe Neapolitans fell back upon Gaeta, and the other part fled over the\r\nPapal frontier.\r\n\r\nGaeta, the refuge of the Pope and the fugitive Princes in 1848, now\r\nbecame the ultimate rock of defence of the Bourbon dynasty. The\r\nposition of the fortress is extremely strong and not unlike Gibraltar\r\nin its main features. A headland running out into the sea and rising\r\nto a height of three or four hundred feet, it is divided by a strip of\r\nsand from the shore-line. The principal defences were then composed of\r\na triple semi-circle of ditches and ramparts one higher than the\r\nother. Had the country been flat the difficulties of the siege would\r\nhave been much increased; its hilly character allowed Cialdini to fix\r\nhis batteries on heights which commanded the top of the Gaeta hill.\r\nBut to profit by this, the Piedmontese were obliged to make fourteen\r\nmiles of roads by which to bring up their artillery. For a month,\r\n10,000 out of the 20,000 besiegers were at work with the spade. The\r\ndefending force amounted to 11,000 men, and was commanded by General\r\nRitucci. From the first, it was certain that the obstinate stand made\r\nat Gaeta could only result in what Lord John Russell called a useless\r\neffusion of blood; nevertheless it seems to have been prompted by a\r\nreal belief that Francis would still recover his kingdom. The\r\nprecedent of his father's return from Gaeta may have strengthened the\r\nKing's illusion; every day he received highly-coloured reports of a\r\ngathering reaction, and as the French fleet in the bay prevented\r\nAdmiral Persano from attacking from the sea, he believed that the time\r\nwhich he could hold out was indefinite. This policy of the French\r\nGovernment need not have greatly cheered him, as its motive was less\r\nto help Francis than to prepare the way, by hampering the Piedmontese,\r\nfor a little fishing in troubled waters. Prince Murat, descendant of\r\nthe _Beau Sabreur_, was busy writing proclamations to remind the world\r\nthat if Francis were impossible and Victor Emmanuel 'wanted finish,'\r\nthere was an eligible young man ready to sacrifice the charms of the\r\nBoulevards for the cares of kingship.\r\n\r\nOn the representations of the British Government the Emperor withdrew\r\nhis fleet in January, advising Francis II. to renounce a hopeless\r\nresistance. But at this eleventh hour the King had adopted the\r\nprinciple of 'no surrender,' and he meant to stick to it. It is\r\ndifficult to blame him; at anyrate, much more serious is the blame due\r\nto the methods of warfare which he was to adopt or to approve\r\nthereafter. His young Queen, who was frequently seen on the ramparts\r\nencouraging the artillerymen at their guns, had probably much to do\r\nwith his virile resolution. The fortress was now attacked by land and\r\nby sea, and the bursting of a powder-magazine inside the walls\r\nhastened its doom. On the 15th of January the Neapolitans laid down\r\ntheir arms, the King having left his dominions by sea. The first act\r\nof the conquerors in the half-ruined town was to attend a mass for the\r\nrepose of the souls of the brave men, friends and foes, who had fallen\r\nduring the siege. Noisy rejoicings would have been unseemly, for the\r\nvanquished were fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe telegram announcing the fall of Gaeta went to Caprera; Garibaldi\r\nread it, and a weight was taken off his mind. 'Civil war is at an\r\nend,' he announced to the little party round the supper-table;\r\n'Cialdini with our army is in Gaeta; now the Italians will not cut one\r\nanother's throats any more.' Later in the evening he seemed so\r\ndepressed that they thought him ill; Colonel Vecchj went to his\r\nbedside to discover what was the matter. He found him reading the\r\n_Times_, and inquired why he had become so suddenly sad. After a\r\npause, Garibaldi said: 'Poor boy! Born at the foot of a throne and\r\nperhaps not by his own fault, hurled from it. He too will have to feel\r\nthe bitterness of exile without preparation.' 'Is that all?' asked\r\nVecchj. 'Do you think it nothing?' was the answer. 'Why then,'\r\npersisted Vecchj, half in jest, 'did you go to Marsala?' 'It was the\r\nduty of us all to go,' Garibaldi said quickly, 'else how could there\r\nhave been one Italy?'\r\n\r\nFrancis II. would have been happy had he found counsellors to persuade\r\nhim to keep pure such titles to sympathy as he then possessed.\r\nDecorum, if not humanity, should have urged him to retire, surrounded\r\nby the solitary flash of glory cast on his fallen cause by the brave\r\ndefence of Gaeta. But the revolution, the new Islam, if it could not\r\nbe conquered must be made to suffer for its triumph. Hence the exiled\r\nKing was advised to call in murder, pillage and rapine as\r\naccomplices. The political brigandage which followed the downfall of\r\nthe King of the Two Sicilies began after the battle of the Volturno\r\nand extended over five years. Its effect on the general situation was\r\nnil; it harassed and distracted the Italian Government and created the\r\nodious necessity of using severe repressive measures, but it never\r\nplaced the crown in danger. One effect it did have, and that was to\r\nraise all over Italy a feeling of reprobation for the late dynasty,\r\nwhich not all the crimes and follies of the two Ferdinands and the\r\nfirst Francis had succeeded in evoking. How many bright lives, full of\r\npromise, were lost in that warfare which even the sacred name of duty\r\ncould not save from being ungrateful and inglorious! Italians who have\r\nlost their children in their country's battles have never been heard\r\nto complain; nowhere was the seemliness of death for native land\r\nbetter understood than it has been in the Italy of this century, but\r\nto lose son or brother in a brigand ambush by the hand of an escaped\r\ngalley-slave--this was hard. The thrust was sharpened by the knowledge\r\nthat the fomenter of the mischief was dwelling securely in the heart\r\nof Italy, the guest of the Head of the Church. From Rome came money\r\nand instructions; from Rome, whether with or without the cognizance of\r\nthe authorities, came recruits. The Roman frontier afforded a means of\r\nescape for all who could reach it, however red their hands were with\r\nblood. What further evidence was needed of the impossibility of an\r\nindefinite duration of this state within a state?\r\n\r\nKing Francis held back at first, but his uncle, the Count of Trapani,\r\nwho openly abetted the brigand partisans, drew him more and more into\r\ncollusion with them and their works. The Belgian ecclesiastic, Mgr. de\r\nMérode, who had then an influence at the Vatican not possessed even\r\nby Antonelli, looked, unless he was much belied, with a very kind eye\r\nupon the new defenders of throne and altar. Efforts have been made to\r\nrepresent the war as one carried on by loyal peasants. No one denies\r\nthat every peasants' war must assume, more or less, an aspect of\r\nbrigandage; nevertheless there have been righteous and patriotic\r\npeasants' wars, such as that of the Klephts in Greece. The question\r\nis, Whether the political brigandage in South Italy had any real\r\naffinity with the wars of the Klephts, or even of the Carlists? And\r\nthe answer must be a negative.\r\n\r\nThe partisan chiefs in the kingdom of Naples were brigands, pure and\r\nsimple, most of whom had either been long wanted by the police, or had\r\nalready suffered in prison for their crimes. They organised their\r\ntroops on the strict principles of brigand bands, and proposed to them\r\nthe same object: pillage. 'Lieut-General' Chiavone who had a mania for\r\nimitating Garibaldi, was the least bad among them; unlike his\r\nprototype, he did not like being under fire, but neither did he care\r\nto spill innocent blood. What, however, can be said for Pilone,\r\n'commander of His Majesty's forces' on Vesuvius; for Ninco Nanco,\r\nBianco dei Bianchi, Tardio, Palma; for Carusso, who cut the throats of\r\nthirteen out of fourteen labourers and told the one left to go and\r\ntell the tale; for the brothers La Gala, who roasted and ate a priest?\r\nIt was said that no horror committed during the Indian Mutiny was here\r\nwithout a parallel.\r\n\r\nOf respectable Neapolitans who held responsible posts under the late\r\n_régime_ not one joined the bands, but they contained French, Austrian\r\nand Belgian officers, and one Prussian. A nephew of Mgr. de Mérode,\r\nthe young Marquis de Trazégnies, was with Chiavone; the Carlist, Josè\r\nBorjès, was with a scoundrel named Crocco. Borjès' case is a hard one.\r\nHe had been made to believe in the genuine character of the\r\ninsurrection and thought that he was giving his sword to an honourable\r\ncause. The melancholy disillusion can be traced in the pages of a\r\nnote-book which he kept from day to day, and which fell into the hands\r\nof the Italians when he was captured. The brief entries show a poetic\r\nmind; he observes the fertile soil, deploring, only, that it is not\r\nbetter cultivated; he admires the smiling valleys and the magnificent\r\nwoods whose kings of the forest show no mark of the centuries that\r\npassed over their fresh verdure. At first Borjès was pleased with the\r\npeasants who came to him, but as they were few, he was obliged to join\r\nCrocco's large band, and he now began to see, with horror, what kind\r\nof associates he had fallen amongst. He had no authority; the brigands\r\nlaughed at his rebukes; never in his life, he writes, had he come\r\nacross such thieves. Before the enemy they ran away like a flock of\r\nsheep, but when it was safe to do so, they murdered both men and\r\nwomen. In desperation, Borjès resolved to try and get to Rome, that he\r\nmight lay the whole truth before the King, but after suffering many\r\nhardships, he was taken with a few others close to the Papal frontier\r\nand was immediately shot. He died bravely, chanting a Spanish litany.\r\n\r\nBorjès' journal notes the opposition of all classes, except the very\r\npoorest and most ignorant. Was it to be believed, therefore, that this\r\nmountain warfare, however long drawn out, could alter one iota the\r\ncourse of events? If Francis II. supposed the insurrection to be the\r\nwork of a virtuous peasantry, why did he allow them to rush to their\r\ndestruction?\r\n\r\nThe task of restoring order was assigned to General Cialdini. He\r\nfound the whole country, from the Abruzzi to Calabria, terrorised by\r\nthe league of native assassins and foreign noblemen. The Modenese\r\ngeneral was a severe officer who had learnt war in Spain, not a gentle\r\nschool. If he exceeded the bounds of dire necessity he merits blame;\r\nbut no one then hoped in the efficacy of half measures.\r\n\r\nOne element in the epidemic of brigandage, and looking forward, the\r\nmost serious of all, was an unconscious but profoundly real socialism.\r\nIf half-a-dozen socialistic emissaries had assumed the office of\r\nguides and instructors, it is even odds that the red flag of communism\r\nwould have displaced the white one of Bourbon. This feature became\r\nmore accentuated as the struggle wore on, and after experience had\r\nbeen made of the new political state. The economic condition of a\r\ngreat part of the southern population was deplorable, but liberty, so\r\nmany thought, would exercise an instantaneous effect, filling the\r\nmouths of the hungry, clothing the naked, providing firing in winter,\r\nsending rain or sunshine as it was wanted. But liberty does none of\r\nthese things. The disappointment of the discovery did not count for\r\nnothing in the difficulties of that period; it counts for everything\r\nin the difficulties of this.\r\n\r\nThe reorganisation of the southern provinces proceeded very slowly. The\r\npost of Lieutenant-Governor was successively conferred on L.C. Farini,\r\nPrince Eugene of Carignano, and Count Ponza di San Martino; for a short\r\ntime Cialdini was invested with the supreme civil as well as military\r\npower. None of these changes met with entire success. The government was\r\nsometimes too weak, sometimes too arbitrary; of the great number of\r\nPiedmontese officials distributed through the south, a few won general\r\napproval, but the majority betrayed want of knowledge and tact, and were\r\njudged accordingly. It was a misfortune for the new administration that\r\nit was not assisted by the steam power of moral enthusiasm which\r\nappeared and disappeared with Garibaldi. There is a great amount of\r\ncertainty that the vast bulk of the population desired union with Italy;\r\nbut it is equally certain that the new Government, though not without\r\ngood intentions, began by failing to please anybody, and the seeds of\r\nmuch future trouble were planted.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February 1861, the first Italian legislature assembled\r\nat Turin in the old Chamber, where, by long years of patient work and\r\nself-sacrificing fidelity to principle, the possibility of\r\nestablishing an Italian constitutional monarchy had been laboriously\r\ntested and established. Only the deputies of Rome and Venice were\r\nstill missing. The first act of the new parliament was to pass an\r\nunanimous vote to the effect that Victor Emmanuel and his heirs should\r\nassume the title of King of Italy. The Italian kingdom thus\r\nconstituted was recognised by England in a fortnight, by France in\r\nthree months, by Prussia in a year, by Spain in four years, by the\r\nPope never.\r\n\r\nAfter the merging of Naples in the Italian body-politic, one of the\r\nthorniest questions that arose was the disposal of the Garibaldian\r\nforces. The chief implored Victor Emmanuel to receive his comrades\r\ninto his own army, a prayer which the King had not the power, even if\r\nhe had the will, to grant, as in the constitutional course of things\r\nthe decision was referred to the ministers, who, again, were crippled\r\nin their action by the military authorities at Turin. Though it is\r\nnatural to sympathise with Garibaldi in his eagerness to obtain\r\ngenerous terms for his old companions-in-arms, it may be true that his\r\ndemand was not one that could be satisfied in its full extent. The\r\nvolunteers were not inferior to the ordinary soldier; about half of\r\nthem were decidedly his superior, but they were a political body\r\nimprovised for a special purpose, and it is easy to see how many were\r\nthe reasons against their forming a division of a conventional army\r\nlike that of Piedmont. Nevertheless, the means ought to have been\r\nfound of convincing them that their King and country were proud of\r\nthem, that their great, their incalculable services were appreciated.\r\nThat such means were not found was supposed to be the fault of Cavour.\r\nIt was only in 1885, on the publication of the fourth volume of the\r\nCount's letters, that it became known how strenuously he had fought\r\nfor justice. Military prejudice was what was really to blame; General\r\nFanti, the Minister of War, even provoked Cavour into telling him\r\n'that they were not in Spain, and that in Italy the army obeyed.' 'A\r\ncry of reprobation would be raised,' he wrote, 'if, while the Bourbon\r\nofficers who ran away disgracefully were confirmed in their rank, the\r\nGaribaldians who beat them were coolly sent about their business.\r\nRather than bear the responsibility of such an act of black\r\ningratitude, I would go and bury myself at Leri. I despise the\r\nungrateful to the point of not feeling angered by them, and I forgive\r\ntheir abuse. But, by Heaven, I could not bear the merited blot of\r\nhaving failed to recognise services such as the conquest of a kingdom\r\nof 9,000,000 inhabitants.'\r\n\r\nCavour, in fact, did obtain something; much more than the army\r\nauthorities wished to give, but much less than Garibaldi asked or than\r\nthe Count would doubtless have given had not his hands been tied. And,\r\ndoubtless, he would have given it with more grace.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the volunteers were deeply offended and sent their griefs\r\nby every post to Caprera. Garibaldi, who refused every favour and\r\nhonour for himself, was worked up into a state of fury by what he\r\ndeemed the wrongs of his faithful followers, and in April he arrived\r\nunexpectedly at Turin to plead their cause before the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. Perhaps by a wise presentiment he had refused to stand for\r\nany constituency; but when Naples elected him her representative,\r\nalmost without opposition, he submitted to the popular will. At Turin\r\nhe fell ill with rheumatic fever, but on the day of the debate on the\r\nSouthern Army he rose from his bed to take his seat in the Chamber.\r\nThe case for the volunteers was opened, and this is worthy of note, by\r\nBaron Ricasoli, aristocrat and conservative. Afterwards Garibaldi got\r\nup--at first he tried to make out the statistics and particulars which\r\nhe had on paper, but blinded by passion and by fever, he threw down\r\nhis notes and launched into a fierce invective against 'the man who\r\nhad made him a foreigner in his own birthplace and the government\r\nwhich was driving the country straight into civil war.' At the words\r\n'civil war' Cavour sprang to his feet, unwontedly moved, and uttered\r\nsome expressions of protest, which were lost in the general uproar.\r\nWhen this was quieted, Garibaldi finished his speech in a moderate\r\ntone, and then General Bixio rose to make that noble appeal to concord\r\nwhich, had he done nothing else for Italy, should be a lasting title\r\nto her gratitude. 'I am one of those,' he said, 'who believe in the\r\nsacredness of the thoughts which have guided General Garibaldi, but\r\nI am also one of those who have faith in the patriotism of Count\r\nCavour. In God's holy name let us make an Italy superior to the\r\nstrife of parties.' He might not be making a parliamentary speech,\r\nhe added, but he would give his children and his life to see peace\r\nestablished--words flowing so plainly from his honest heart that\r\nsavage indeed would have been the enmity which, for the time, at\r\nleast, was not quelled. Cavour grasped the olive branch at once; all\r\nhis momentary ire vanished. He made excuses for his adversary; from\r\nthe grief which he had felt himself when he advised the King to cede\r\nSavoy and Nice, he could understand the general's resentment. He had\r\nalways been, he said in general terms, a friend to the volunteers.\r\nWhat he did not even remotely suggest was the dissension which existed\r\nbetween himself and his military colleague on the subject of the\r\nGaribaldians. The least hint would have gained for Cavour any amount\r\nof applause and popularity; but he preferred to bear all the blame\r\nrather than bring the national army into disfavour. Garibaldi replied\r\n'that he had never doubted the Count's patriotism;' but at the end of\r\nthe three days' debate he declared himself dissatisfied with the\r\nMinisterial assurances touching the volunteers in particular and the\r\ncountry's armaments as a whole. As Cavour left the Chamber after the\r\nfinal night's sitting, he remarked to a friend--all his fine\r\nequanimity returned: 'And yet, and yet, when the time comes for war, I\r\nshall take General Garibaldi under my arm and say: \"Let's go and see\r\nwhat they are about inside Verona!\"'\r\n\r\nCialdini tried to stir up the quarrel anew by a letter full of foolish\r\npersonalities; but to this sort of attack Garibaldi was impervious. It\r\nmattered nothing to him that a man should make rude remarks about his\r\nwearing a red shirt. He admired the victor of Castelfidardo as one of\r\nItaly's best soldiers. He was, therefore, perfectly ready to embrace\r\nCialdini at the King's request before he left Turin for Caprera. It\r\ncost him more to consent to an interview of reconciliation with the\r\nPrime Minister in the royal presence, because his disagreement with\r\nCavour was purely political and impersonal, and was rooted more deeply\r\nin his heart than any private irritation could be; but he did consent,\r\nand the interview took place on the 23rd of April. Probably Victor\r\nEmmanuel in after days was never gladder of anything he had done than\r\nof having caused his two great subjects--both his subjects born--to\r\npart for the last time in this mortal life in peace.\r\n\r\nOn one other memorable occasion the man who, at twenty-two, said that\r\nhe meant to be Prime Minister of Italy, and who now, at fifty-one, was\r\nkeeping his word, filled with his presence the Chamber of which he\r\nseemed to incarnate the life and history--which may be said to have\r\nbeen his only home, for Cavour hardly had a private life. Very soon\r\nthe familiar figure was to vacate the accustomed place for ever.\r\n\r\nAn obscure deputy put a question on the 25th of May, which gave Cavour\r\nthe opportunity of expounding his views about Rome still more\r\nexplicitly than in the previous autumn. It was impossible, he said, to\r\nconceive Italian unity without Rome as capital. Were there any other\r\nsolution to the problem he would be willing to give it due\r\nconsideration, but there was not. The position of a capital was not\r\ndecided by climatic or topographical reasons: a glance at capitals of\r\nEurope was sufficient to certify the fact; it was decided by moral\r\nreasons. Now Rome, alone out of the Italian cities, had an undisputed\r\nmoral claim to primacy. 'As far as I am personally concerned,' he\r\nsaid, 'I shall go to Rome with sorrow; not caring for art, I am sure\r\nthat among the most splendid monuments of ancient and modern Rome I\r\nshall regret the sedate and unpoetic streets of my native town.' It\r\ngrieved him to think that Turin must resign her most cherished\r\nprivilege, but he knew his fellow-citizens, and he knew them to be\r\nready to make this last sacrifice to their country. Might Italy not\r\nforget the cradle of her liberties when her seat of government was\r\nfirmly established in the Eternal City!\r\n\r\nHe went on to say that he had not lost the hope that France and the\r\nHead of the Church would yield to the inexorable logic of the\r\nsituation, and that the same generation which had resuscitated Italy\r\nwould accomplish the still grander task of concluding a peace between\r\nthe State and the Church, liberty and religion. These were no formal\r\nwords; Cavour's whole heart was set on their realisation. He did not\r\ndoubt that the knot, if not untied, would be cut by the sword sooner\r\nor later. He felt as sure as Mazzini felt that this would happen; but\r\nmore than any man of any party he had reckoned the cost of ranging the\r\nChurch with its vast potential powers for good, for order, for public\r\nmorality, among the implacable enemies of the nascent kingdom. And,\r\ntherefore, his last public utterance was a cry for religious peace.\r\n\r\nAlways an immense worker, in these latter months Cavour had been\r\npossessed by a feverish activity. 'I must make haste to finish my\r\nwork,' he said; 'I feel that this miserable body of mine is giving way\r\nbeneath the mind and will which still urge it on. Some fine day you\r\nwill see me break down upon the road.' On the 6th of June, after two\r\nor three days of so-called sudden illness, he broke down upon the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nFra Giacomo, faithful to his old promise, administered the sacraments\r\nto the dying minister, who told Farini 'to tell the good people of\r\nTurin that he died a Christian.' After this his mind rambled, but\r\nalways upon the themes that had so completely absorbed it: Rome,\r\nVenice, Naples--'no state of siege,' was one of his broken sayings\r\nthat referred to Naples. It was his farewell protest against brute\r\nforce in which he had never believed. 'Cleanse them, cleanse them,' he\r\nrepeated; cleanse the people of the South of their moral contagion;\r\nthat, not force, was the remedy. He was able to recognise the King,\r\nbut unable to collect the ideas which he wished to express to him.\r\n\r\nCavour's death caused a profound sensation in Europe, and in Italy and\r\nin England awakened great sorrow. Hardly any public man has received\r\nso splendid a tribute as that rendered to his memory in the British\r\nHouses of Parliament. The same words were on the lips of all: What\r\nwould Italy do without him? Death is commonly the great reminder that\r\nno man is necessary. Nations fulfil their destinies even though their\r\ngreatest sons be laid under the turf. And Italy has fulfilled her\r\ndestinies, but there are Italians who believe that had Cavour lived to\r\ncomplete his task, although his dream of an Eirenicon might never have\r\nbeen realised, their country would not have passed through the _selva\r\nselvaggia_ of mistakes and humiliations into which she now entered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nROME OR DEATH\r\n\r\n1861-1864\r\n\r\nCavour's Successors--Aspromonte--The September Convention--Garibaldi's\r\nVisit to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two possible successors to Cavour, the Tuscan, Bettino\r\nRicasoli, and Urban Rattazzi, a Piedmontese barrister. The first\r\nbelonged to the right, the second to the left centre in the\r\nParliamentary combinations. Cavour had no very close personal\r\nrelations with either, but he knew their characters. Rattazzi formerly\r\nheld ministerial office under him, and the long Tuscan crisis of 1859,\r\nlooked at, as he looked at it, from the inside, gave him opportunities\r\nof judging the Iron Baron who opposed even his own will on more than\r\none occasion in that great emergency. Ricasoli was rigid, frigid, a\r\nfrequenter of the straightest possible roads; Rattazzi, supple,\r\naccommodating, with an incorrigible partiality for umbrageous by-ways.\r\nHe was already an 'old parliamentary hand,' and in the future, through\r\na series of ministerial lapses, any one of which would have condemned\r\nmost men to seclusion, he preserved his talent for manufacturing\r\nmajorities and holding his party together. Choosing between these two\r\ncandidates, Cavour before he died gave his preference to Ricasoli, who\r\nwas charged by the King with the formation of a ministry in which he\r\ntook the Treasury and the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nRicasoli was without ambition, and he rather under than over-rated his\r\nabilities, but he went to work with considerable confidence in his power\r\nof setting everything right. A perfectly open and honest statesman\r\nought to be able, he imagined, to solve the most difficult problems. Why\r\nnot, except that the world is not what it ought to be? In home politics\r\nhe offended the Party of Action by telling them plainly that if they\r\nbroke the law they would have to pay the cost, and he offended his own\r\nparty by refusing to interfere with the right of meeting or any other\r\nconstitutional right of citizens, whether they were followers of Mazzini\r\nor of anybody else, as long as they kept within legal bounds. He wrote\r\nan elaborate letter to Pius IX., in which he sought to persuade the\r\nPontiff of the sweet reasonableness of renouncing claims which, for a\r\nvery long spell, had cast nothing but discredit on religion. Ricasoli's\r\nattitude towards the Temporal Power was unique in this century. Like\r\nDante's, his hatred of it was religious. He was a Catholic, not because\r\nhe had never thought or studied, but because, having thought and\r\nstudied, he assented, and from this standpoint he ascribed most of the\r\nwounds of the Church to her subordination of her spiritual mission to\r\nmaterial interests. He encouraged Padre Passaglia to collect the\r\nsignatures of priests for a petition praying the Pope to cease opposing\r\nthe desires of all Italy; 8943 names were affixed in a short time. The\r\nonly result of these transactions was that Cardinal Antonelli remarked\r\nto the French Government that the Holy See would never come to terms\r\nwith robbers, and that, although at war with the Turin Cabinet, 'the\r\nPope's relations with Italy were excellent.' More harmful to Ricasoli\r\nthan the fulminations of the Vatican was the veiled but determined\r\nhostility of Napoleon III. Cavour succeeded in more or less keeping the\r\nEmperor in ignorance of the degree to which their long partnership\r\nresembled a duel. He made him think that he was leading while he was\r\nbeing led. With Ricasoli there could be no such illusions. Napoleon\r\nunderstood him to be a man whom he might break, not bend. He thought it\r\ndesirable to break him, and Imperial desires had many channels, at that\r\ntime, towards fulfilment.\r\n\r\nThe Ricasoli ministry fell in February 1862, and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, Rattazzi was called to power. The new premier soon\r\ningratiated himself with the King, who found him easier to get on with\r\nthan the Florentine _grand seigneur_; with Garibaldi, whom he\r\npersuaded that some great step in the national redemption was on the\r\neve of accomplishment; with Napoleon, who divined in him an\r\ninstrument. Meanwhile, in his own mind, he proposed to eclipse Cavour,\r\nout-manoeuvre all parties, and make his name immortal. This remains\r\nthe most probable, as it is the most lenient interpretation to which\r\nhis strange policy is open.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi was encouraged to visit the principal towns of North Italy\r\nin order to institute the _Tiro Nazionale_ or Rifle Association, which\r\nwas said to be meant to form the basis of a permanent volunteer force\r\non the English pattern. For many reasons, such a scheme was not likely\r\nto succeed in Italy, but most people supposed the object to be\r\ndifferent--namely, the preparation of the youth of the nation for an\r\nimmediate war. The idea was strengthened when it was observed that\r\nTrescorre, in the province of Bergamo, where Garibaldi stopped to take\r\na course of sulphur baths, became the centre of a gathering which\r\nincluded the greater part of his old Sicilian staff. There was no\r\nconcealment in what was done, and the Government manifested no alarm.\r\nThe air was full of rumours, and in particular much was said about a\r\nGaribaldian expedition to Greece, for which, it was stated and\r\nre-stated, Rattazzi had promised £40,000. That Garibaldi meant to cast\r\nhis lot in any struggle not bearing directly on Italian affairs, as\r\nlong as the questions of Rome and Venice still hung in the balance, is\r\nnot to be believed. A little earlier than this date, President Lincoln\r\ninvited him to take the supreme command of the Federal army in the war\r\nfor the Union, and he declined the offer, attractive though it must\r\nhave been to him, both as a soldier and an abhorrer of slavery,\r\nbecause he did not think that Italy could spare him. But the 'Greek\r\nExpedition,' though a misleading name, was not altogether a blind.\r\nBefore Cavour's death, there had been frequent discussion of a project\r\nfor revolutionising the east of Europe on a grand scale; Hungary and\r\nthe southern provinces of the Austrian Empire were to co-operate with\r\nthe Slavs and other populations under Turkey in a movement which, even\r\nif only partially successful, would go far to facilitate the\r\nliberation of Venice. It cannot be doubted that Rattazzi's brain was\r\nat work on something of this sort, but the mobilisation, so to speak,\r\nof the Garibaldians suggested proceedings nearer home. Trescorre was\r\nvery far from the sea, very near the Austrian frontier.\r\n\r\nIn spite of contradictions, a plan for invading the Trentino, or South\r\nTyrol, almost certainly did exist. Whether Garibaldi was alone\r\nanswerable for it cannot be determined. The Government became suddenly\r\nalive to the enormous peril such an attack would involve, and arrested\r\nseveral of the Garibaldian officers at Sarnico. They were conveyed to\r\nBrescia, where a popular attempt was made to liberate them; the troops\r\nfired on the crowd, and some blood was shed. Garibaldi wrote an\r\nindignant protest and retired, first to the villa of Signora Cairoli\r\nat Belgirate, and then to Caprera. He did not, however, remain there\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAfter this point, the thread of events becomes tangled beyond the hope\r\nof unravelment. What were the causes which led Garibaldi into the\r\ndesperate venture that ended at Aspromonte? Recollecting his\r\nhesitation before assuming the leadership of the Sicilian expedition,\r\nit seemed the more unintelligible that he should now undertake an\r\nenterprise which, unless he could rely on the complicity of\r\nGovernment, had not a single possibility of success. His own old\r\ncomrades were opposed to it, and it was notorious that Mazzini, to\r\nwhom the counsels of despair were generally either rightly or wrongly\r\nattributed, had nothing to do with inspiring this attempt. In justice\r\nto Rattazzi, it must be allowed that, after the arrests at Sarnico,\r\nGaribaldi went into open opposition to the ministry, which he\r\ndenounced as subservient to Napoleon. Nevertheless, with the\r\nremembrance of past circumstances in his mind, he may have felt\r\nconvinced that the Prime Minister did not mean or that he would not\r\ndare to oppose him by force. One thing is certain; from beginning to\r\nend he never contemplated civil war. His disobedience to the King of\r\nItaly had only one purpose--to give him Rome. He was no more a rebel\r\nto Victor Emmanuel than when he marched through Sicily in 1860.\r\n\r\nThe earlier stages of the affair were not calculated to weaken a\r\nbelief in the effective non-intervention of Government. Garibaldi went\r\nto Palermo, where he arrived in the evening of the 28th of June. The\r\nyoung Princes Umberto and Amedeo were on a visit to the Prefect, the\r\nMarquis Pallavicini, and happened to be that night at the opera. All\r\nat once they perceived the spectators leave the house in a body, and\r\nthey were left alone; on asking the reason, they heard that Garibaldi\r\nhad just landed--all were gone to greet him! Before the departure of\r\nthe Princes next day, the chief and his future King had an\r\naffectionate meeting, while the population renewed the scenes of wild\r\nenthusiasm of two years ago. Some of Garibaldi's intimate friends\r\nassert that when he reached Palermo he had still no intention of\r\ntaking up arms. He soon began, however, to speak in a warlike tone,\r\nand at a review of the National Guard in presence of the Prefect, the\r\nSyndic, and all the authorities, he told the 'People of the Vespers'\r\nthat if another Vespers were wanted to do it, Napoleon III., head of\r\nthe brigands, must be ejected from Rome. The epithet was not bestowed\r\nat random; Lord Palmerston confirmed it when he said from his place in\r\nthe House of Commons: 'In Rome there is a French garrison; under its\r\nshelter there exists a committee of 200, whose practice is to organise\r\na band of murderers, the scum and dross of every nation, and send them\r\ninto the Neapolitan territory to commit every atrocity!' As a\r\ncriticism the words are not less strong; but the public defiance of\r\nNapoleon, and the threat with which it was accompanied, dictated one\r\nplain duty to the Italian Government if they meant to keep the\r\npeace--the arrest of Garibaldi and his embarkation for Caprera.\r\n\r\nThis they did not do; confining themselves to the recall of the\r\nMarquis Pallavicini. Garibaldi went over the ground made glorious by\r\nhis former exploits--past Calatafimi to Marsala. It was at Marsala\r\nthat, while he harangued his followers in a church, a voice in the\r\ncrowd raised a cry of '_Rome or death!_' 'Yes; Rome or death!'\r\nrepeated Garibaldi; and thus the watchword originated which will\r\nendure written in blood on the Bitter Mount and on the Plain of\r\nNomentum. Who raised it first? Perhaps some humble Sicilian fisherman.\r\nIts haunting music coming he knew not whence, sounding in his ear like\r\nan omen, was what wedded Garibaldi irrevocably to the undertaking. It\r\nwas the casting interposition of chance, or, shall it be said, of\r\nProvidence? Like all men of his mould, Garibaldi was governed by\r\npoetry, by romance. Besides the general patriotic sentiment, he had a\r\npeculiar personal feeling about Rome, 'which for me,' he once wrote,\r\n'is Italy.' In 1849, the Assembly in its last moments invested him\r\nwith plenary powers for the defence of the Eternal City, and this\r\nvote, never revoked, imposed on his imagination a permanent mandate.\r\n'Rome or death' suggested an idea to him which he had never before\r\nentertained, prodigal though he had been of his person in a hundred\r\nfights: What if his own death were the one thing needful to\r\nprecipitate the solution of the problem?\r\n\r\nFrom Marsala he returned to Palermo, where, in the broad light of day,\r\nhe summoned the Faithful, who came, as usual, at his bidding, without\r\nasking why or where?--the happy few who followed him in 1859 and 1860;\r\nwho would follow him in 1867, and even in 1870, when they gave their\r\nlives for a people that did not thank them, because he willed it so.\r\nHe sent out also a call to the Sicilian _Picciotti_, the _Squadre_ of\r\nlast year; and it is much to their credit that they too who cared\r\npossibly remarkably little for _Roma Capitale_, obeyed the man who had\r\nfreed them. And Rattazzi knew of all this, and did nothing.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, Garibaldi took command of 3000 volunteers in the\r\nwoods of Ficuzza. Then, indeed, the Government wasted much paper on\r\nproclamations, and closed the door of the stable when the horse was\r\ngone. General Cugia was sent to Palermo to repress the movement.\r\nNevertheless Garibaldi, with his constantly increasing band, made a\r\ntriumphant progress across the island, and a more than royal entry\r\ninto Catania. At Mezzojuso he was present at a _Te Deum_ chanted in\r\nhis honour. On the 22nd, when the royal troops were, it seems, really\r\nordered to march on Catania, Garibaldi took possession of a couple of\r\nmerchant vessels that had just reached the port, and sailed away by\r\nnight for the Calabrian coast with about 1000 of his men.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Italian Government, whether by spontaneous conviction\r\nor by pressure from without, had resolved that the band should never\r\nget as far as the Papal frontier. If Garibaldi knew or realised their\r\nresolution, it is a mystery why he did not attempt to effect a landing\r\nnearer that frontier, if not actually within it. The deserted shore of\r\nthe Pontine marshes would, one would think, have offered attractions\r\nto men who were as little afraid of fever as of bullets. A sort of\r\nsuperstition may have ruled the choice of the path, which was that\r\nwhich led to victory in 1860. It was not practicable, however, to\r\nfollow it exactly. The tactics were different. Then the desire was to\r\nmeet the enemy anywhere and everywhere; now the pursuer had to be\r\neluded, because Garibaldi was determined not to fight him. Thus,\r\ninstead of marching straight on Reggio, the volunteers sought\r\nconcealment in the great mountain mass which forms the southernmost\r\nbulwark of the Apennines. The dense and trackless forests could have\r\ngiven cover for a long while to a native brigand troop, with intimate\r\nknowledge of the country and ways and means of obtaining\r\nprovisions--not to a band like this of Garibaldi. They wandered about\r\nfor three days, suffering from almost total want of food, and from the\r\ngreat fatigue of climbing the dried-up watercourses which serve as\r\npaths. On the 28th of August they reached the heights of Aspromonte--a\r\nstrong position, from which only a large force could have dislodged\r\nthem had they defended it.\r\n\r\nGeneral La Marmora, then Prefect of Naples, and commander-in-chief of\r\nthe army in the south, reinforced the troops in Calabria to prevent\r\nGaribaldi's advance, but the direction of the decisive operation fell\r\nby accident to Cialdini, whom the Government despatched to Sicily\r\nwhen they tardily made up their minds to take energetic measures. On\r\nhis voyage to Messina, Cialdini heard that the volunteers had already\r\ncrossed the Straits; he therefore changed his course, and hastening to\r\nReggio, invested himself with the command on the mainland. At Reggio\r\nhe met Colonel Pallavicini, whom he ordered in terms that might have\r\nbeen more suitable had he been engaged in hunting brigands, 'to crush\r\nGaribaldi completely, and only accept from him unconditional\r\nsurrender.' Pallavicini started with six or seven battalions of\r\nBersaglieri. It was the 29th of August. Garibaldi saw them coming when\r\nthey were still three miles off. He could have dispersed his men in\r\nthe forest and himself escaped, for the time, and perhaps altogether,\r\nfor the sea which had so often befriended him was not far off. But\r\nalthough he did not mean to resist, a dogged instinct drove away the\r\nthought of flight. In the official account it was stated that an\r\nofficer was sent in advance of the royal troops to demand surrender.\r\nNo such officer was seen in the Garibaldian encampment till after the\r\nattack. The troops rapidly ascended an eminence, facing that on which\r\nthe Garibaldians were posted, and opened a violent fusillade, which,\r\nto Garibaldi's dismay, was returned for a few minutes by his right,\r\nconsisting of young Sicilians who were not sufficiently disciplined to\r\nstand being made targets of without replying. The contention, however,\r\nthat they were the first to fire, has the testimony of every\r\neye-witness on the side of the volunteers against it. All the\r\nGaribaldian bugles sounded 'Cease firing,' and Garibaldi walked down\r\nin front of the ranks conjuring the men to obey. While he was thus\r\nemployed, a spent ball struck his thigh, and a bullet entered his\r\nright foot. At first he remained standing, and repeated, 'Do not\r\nfire,' but he was obliged to sit down, and some of his officers\r\ncarried him under a tree. The whole 'feat of arms,' as General\r\nCialdini described it, did not last more than a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nPallavicini approached the wounded hero bareheaded, and said that he\r\nmade his acquaintance on the most unfortunate day of his own life. He\r\nwas received with nothing but kind praise for doing his duty. The\r\nfirst night was passed by the prisoner in a shepherd's hut. The few\r\ndevoted followers who were with him were strangely impressed by that\r\nmidnight watch; the moon shining on the forest, the shepherds' dogs\r\nhowling in the mountain silence, and their chief lying wounded, it\r\nmight be to death, in the name of the King to whom he had given this\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNext day, in a litter sheltered from the sun with branches of wild\r\nlaurel, Garibaldi was carried down the steep rocks to Scilla, whence\r\nhe was conveyed by sea to the fort of Varignano. It was not till after\r\nmonths of acute suffering, borne with a gentleness that made the\r\ndoctors say: 'This man is not a soldier, but a saint,' that, through\r\nthe skill of the French surgeon, Nélaton, the position of the ball was\r\ndetermined, and its extraction rendered possible.\r\n\r\nA general amnesty issued on the occasion of the marriage of the King's\r\nsecond daughter with the King of Portugal relieved the Government of\r\nhaving to decide whether Garibaldi was to be tried, and if so, what\r\nfor; but the unpopularity into which the ministry had fallen could not\r\nbe so easily dissipated. The Minister of Foreign Affairs (Durando)\r\npublished a note in which it was stated that Garibaldi had only\r\nattempted to realise, in an irregular way, the desire of the whole\r\nnation, and that, although he had been checked, the tension of the\r\nsituation was such that it could not be indefinitely prolonged. This\r\nwas true, but it hardly improved the case for the Government. In Latin\r\ncountries, ministers do not cling to power; as soon as the wind blows\r\nagainst them, they resign to give the public time to forget their\r\nfaults, and to become dissatisfied with their political rivals.\r\nUsually a very short time is required. Therefore, forestalling a vote\r\nof censure in the Chambers, where he had never yet had a real\r\nmajority, Rattazzi resigned office with a parting homily in which he\r\nclaimed to have saved the national institutions.\r\n\r\nThe administration which followed contained the well-known names of\r\nFarini, Minghetti, Pasolini, Peruzzi, Delia Rovere, Menabrea. When\r\nFarini's fatal illness set in, Minghetti replaced him as Prime\r\nMinister, and Visconti Venosta took the Foreign Office. They found the\r\ncountry in a lamentable state, embittered by Aspromonte, still\r\ninfected with brigandage, and suffering from an increasing deficit,\r\ncoupled with a diminishing revenue. The administrative and financial\r\nunification of Italy, still far from complete, presented the gravest\r\ndifficulties. The political aspect of affairs, and especially the\r\npresence of the French in Rome, provoked a general sense of\r\ninstability which was contrary to the organisation of the new state\r\nand the development of its resources. The ministers sought remedies or\r\npalliatives for these several evils, and to meet the last they opened\r\nnegotiations with France, which resulted in the compromise known as\r\nthe September Convention. It was long before the treaty was concluded,\r\nas for more than a year the French Government refused to remove the\r\ngarrison on any terms; but in the autumn of 1864 the following\r\narrangement was signed by both parties: that Italy should protect the\r\nPapal frontier from all attack from the outside; that France should\r\ngradually withdraw her troops, the complete evacuation to take place\r\nwithin two years; that Italy should waive the right of protest against\r\nthe internal organisation of the Papal army unless its proportions\r\nbecame such as to be a manifest threat to the Italian kingdom; that\r\nthe Italian capital should be moved to Florence within six months of\r\nthe approval of the Convention by Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese terms were in part the same as those proposed by Prince Napoleon\r\nto Cavour shortly before the death of that statesman, who had promised\r\nto support them as a temporary makeshift, and in order to get the\r\nFrench out of Italy. But they were in part different, and they\r\ncontained two new provisions which it is morally certain that Cavour\r\nwould never have agreed to--the prolongation of the French occupation\r\nfor two years (Cavour had insisted that it should cease in a\r\nfortnight), and the transfer of the capital, which was now made a\r\n_sine quâ non_ by Napoleon, for evident reasons. While it was clear\r\nthat Turin could not be the permanent capital of a kingdom that\r\nstretched to Ætna, if once the seat of government were removed to\r\nFlorence a thousand arguments and interests would spring up in favour\r\nof keeping it there. So, at least, it was sure to seem to a foreigner.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the solution was no solution; the Italians could\r\nnot be reconciled to the loss of Rome either by the beauty and\r\nhistoric splendour of the city on the Arno, or by its immunity from\r\nmalaria, which was then feared as a serious drawback, though Rome has\r\nbecome, under its present rulers, the healthiest capital in Europe.\r\nBut Napoleon thought that he was playing a trump card when he dictated\r\nthe sacrifice of Turin.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic Turinese were unprepared for the blow. They had been\r\ntold again and again that till the seat of government was established\r\non the Tiber, it should abide under the shadow of the Alps--white\r\nguardian angels of Italy--in the custody of the hardy population which\r\nhad shown itself so well worthy of the trust. The ministry foresaw the\r\neffect which the convention would have on the minds of the Turinese,\r\nand they resorted to the weak subterfuge of keeping its terms secret\r\nas long as they could. Rumours, however, leaked out, and these, as\r\nusual, exaggerated the evil. It was said that Rome was categorically\r\nabandoned. On the 20th of September crowds began to fill the streets,\r\ncrying: 'Rome or Turin!' and on the two following days there were\r\nencounters between the populace and the military, in which the latter\r\nresorted to unnecessary and almost provocative violence. Amidst the\r\nchorus of censure aroused by these events, the Minghetti cabinet\r\nresigned, and General La Marmora, who, as a Piedmontese, was fitted to\r\nsoothe the excited feelings of his fellow-citizens, was called upon to\r\nform a ministry.\r\n\r\nThe change of capital received the sanction of Parliament on the 19th\r\nof November. Outside Piedmont it was not unpopular; people felt that,\r\nafter all, it rested with themselves to make Florence no final\r\nhalting-place, but a step towards Rome. The Papal Government, which\r\nhad been a stranger to the late negotiations, expressed a supreme\r\nindifference to the whole affair, even to the contemplated departure\r\nof the French troops, 'which concerned the Imperial Government, not\r\nthe Pope,' said Cardinal Antonelli, 'since the occupation had been\r\ndetermined by French interests.' It cannot be asserted that the Pope\r\never assumed a gratitude which he did not feel towards the monarch who\r\nkept him on his throne for twenty years.\r\n\r\nThis year, 1864, was marked by an incident which, though not a\r\npolitical event, should never be forgotten in the history of Italian\r\nliberation--Garibaldi's visit to England. He came, the prisoner of\r\nAspromonte, not the conqueror of Sicily: a distinction that might have\r\nmade a difference elsewhere, but the English sometimes worship\r\nmisfortune as other peoples worship success. No sovereign from oversea\r\nwas ever received by them as they received the Italian hero; a\r\nreception showing the sympathies of a century rather than the caprice\r\nor curiosity of an hour. Half a million throats shouted London's\r\nwelcome; the soldier of two worlds knew the roar of battle, and the\r\nroar of the sea was familiar to the Nizzard sailor, but it is said\r\nthat when Garibaldi heard the stupendous and almost awful British roar\r\nwhich greeted him as he came out of the Nine Elms station, and took\r\nhis seat in the carriage that was to convey him to Stafford House, he\r\nlooked completely disconcerted. From the heir to the throne to the\r\ncrossing-sweeper, all combined to do him honour; where Garibaldi was\r\nnot, through the breadth of the land the very poor bought his portrait\r\nand pasted it on their whitewashed cottage walls. London made him its\r\ncitizen. The greatest living English poet invited him to plant a tree\r\nin his garden: a memory he recalled nearly at the close of his own\r\nhonoured life:--\r\n\r\n  Or watch the waving pine which here\r\n    The warrior of Caprera set,\r\n    A name that earth shall not forget\r\n  Till earth has rolled her latest year.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi showed himself mindful of old friends; at the opera he\r\nrecognised Admiral Mundy in a box, and immediately rose and went to\r\noffer him his respects. At Portsmouth, he not only went to see the\r\nmother of Signora White-Mario (the providence of his wounded in many a\r\ncampaign), but also paid an unrecorded visit to two maiden sisters in\r\nhumble circumstances, who had shown him kindness when he was an exile\r\nin England; they related ever afterwards the sensation caused by his\r\nappearance in their narrow courtyard, where it was difficult to turn\r\nthe big carriage which the authorities had placed at his disposal. He\r\ntwice met the great Italian whom he addressed as Master: transferring,\r\nas it were, to Mazzini's brows the crown of glory that surrounded his\r\nown. Another exile, Louis Blanc, used to tell how, when he went to\r\ncall on Garibaldi, he found him seated on a sofa, receiving the homage\r\nof the fairest and most illustrious members of the English\r\naristocracy; when the Friend of the People was announced (a title\r\ndeserved by Louis Blanc, if not for his possibly fallacious theories,\r\nstill for the rare sincerity of his life), the hero started to his\r\nfeet and most earnestly begged him to sit beside him. 'Which I could\r\nnot do!' the narrator of the scene would add with a look of comical\r\nalarm for his threatened modesty.\r\n\r\nThese friendly passages with the proscripts in London, as well as the\r\nstirring appeal spoken by Garibaldi on behalf of the Poles, did not\r\nplease foreign Powers. The Austrian ambassador shut himself up in his\r\nhouse; it was remarked that the only members of the diplomatic body\r\nwho were seen at the Garibaldi _fêtes_ were the representatives of the\r\nUnited States and of the Sublime Porte. The Emperor Napoleon was said\r\nto be angry. Lord Palmerston assured the House of Commons that no\r\nremonstrance had been received from France or from any foreign\r\ngovernment, and that if it had been received, it would not have been\r\nheeded. Yet the English Government took the course of hinting to the\r\nguest of England that his visit had lasted long enough. In some\r\nquarters it was reported that they feared disturbances among the Irish\r\noperatives in the manufacturing towns, had he gone, as he intended,\r\nto the north. Whatever were the motives that inspired it, their action\r\nin the matter cannot be remembered with complacency, but it was\r\npowerless to undo the significance of the great current of enthusiasm\r\nwhich had passed through the English land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR VENICE\r\n\r\n1864-1866\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Alliance--Custoza--Lissa--The Volunteers--Acquisition of\r\nVenetia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe change of capital was carried out in 1865, and the lull which\r\nfollowed gave an appearance of correctness to the surmise that if the\r\nSeptember Convention had not solved the Roman question, it had,\r\nanyhow, reduced it to a state of quiescence. But there were other\r\nreasons why Rome was kept, for the moment, not indeed out of mind, but\r\nout of sight. The opinion grew that the emancipation of Venice, too\r\nlong delayed, ought to take precedence of every other political\r\nobject. On this point there was no disagreement among the 22,000,000\r\nfree Italians, who felt the servitude of Venice to be an hourly\r\ndisgrace and reproach; no one even ventured to preach patience. A\r\ncurious chapter might be written on the schemes woven between the\r\nPeace of Villafranca and the year 1866, for the realisation of the\r\nunfulfilled promise of freedom from Alps to sea. Foremost among the\r\nschemers was Victor Emmanuel, and if some persons may be shocked by\r\nthe idea of a royal conspirator, more will admire the patriotism which\r\nmade the King hold out his hand to Mazzini, whose sentiments about\r\nmonarchy, and especially about the Savoy dynasty, were a secret to no\r\none, least of all to him. But as Mazzini placed those sentiments on\r\nsecond rank to the grand end of Italian unity, so the King, to serve\r\nthe same end, showed himself superior to prejudices which in most men\r\nwould have proved insuperable. The fact that Victor Emmanuel opened\r\nnegotiations with Mazzini, and maintained them, off and on, for years,\r\nproves amongst other things, that he knew the exiled patriot better\r\nthan the world yet knew him. He may have understood that by turning\r\nrepublican sympathies into the groove of unity (not their necessary or\r\neven their most natural groove), Mazzini made an Italian kingdom\r\npossible. There is reason to think that the King's ministers were\r\nkept entirely ignorant of his correspondence with the Agitator. The\r\nletters were impersonal drafts carried to and fro by means of trusted\r\nemissaries; each party freely expounded his views, and stated the\r\nterms on which his support could be given. Victor Emmanuel's favourite\r\nidea was a revolution in Galicia. When Garibaldi returned from England\r\nhe was nearly commissioned to start for Constantinople, whence he was\r\nto lead an expedition through Roumania into Galicia. It seems to have\r\nbeen due to Garibaldi's own good sense that so extremely unpromising a\r\nproject was abandoned. General Klapka was another of Victor Emmanuel's\r\nsecret revolutionary correspondents. The very wildness of the plans\r\nthat floated in the air betokened the feverish anxiety to do something\r\nwhich had taken hold of all minds.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 a scheme of a different sort, and of momentous consequences,\r\ngrew into shape. It was a scheme of which Cavour first guessed the\r\npossibility, as well as the far-reaching results. In August 1865 Count\r\nBismarck asked General La Marmora whether Italy would join Prussia in\r\nthe contingency of a war with Austria? Only a year before he was still\r\nthinking of carrying out his policy with the aid of Austria, and he\r\nhad offered to help her to wrench Lombardy from Italy (and from France\r\nif she intervened), in payment for her consent to his designs. But\r\nnow, though the Austrians did not even remotely suspect it, his\r\nthoughts were resolutely turned to the Italian alliance. Without this\r\nalliance Italy might, indeed, have acquired Venice, but would the\r\nGerman Empire have been founded?\r\n\r\nFor a time the proposal was suspended, owing to the temporary\r\nunderstanding concluded between Prussia and Austria at Gastein; and\r\nin the interim, General La Marmora urged the Viennese Government to\r\ncede Venetia in return for a compensation of five hundred million\r\nfrancs. But those whom the gods would destroy they make mad. Austria\r\npreserved her infatuated sense of security almost till the rude\r\nawakening caused by the rifle-shots that ushered in the campaign of\r\nSadowa.\r\n\r\nOne thing which contributed to keeping Europe in the dark as to the\r\nimpending cataclysm was the character and known tendencies of King\r\nWilliam I. of Prussia, whose conservative, not to say retrograde\r\nsentiments made it difficult to picture him at the head of what was\r\nreally a great revolutionary movement, in spite of the militarism that\r\nsurrounded it. With consummate art, Count Bismarck little by little\r\nconcentrated all his master's ideas about royal divinity in general\r\ninto one overwhelming belief in his own divine right to be German\r\nEmperor, and so transformed an obstacle into the corner-stone of the\r\nedifice he wished to build. But this could hardly be foreseen. At the\r\nNew Year's Day reception of 1866, Napoleon announced an era of\r\nuniversal peace; henceforth all nations were to arrange their\r\ndifferences amicably, as had been done at Gastein If the illusion was\r\ncomplete, it was destined to be of short duration.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the Prussian proposal to Italy was formally renewed, and\r\nthis time it was accepted. The secret treaty of an offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance for three months was signed on the 8th of April.\r\nLess than three weeks later, Austria, which was slowly beginning to\r\nfeel some uneasiness, proposed to Napoleon the cession of Venetia,\r\nwhile exacting from Italy only a simple promise of neutrality in case\r\nof war. General La Marmora held the honour of the country and his own\r\nto compel fidelity to the prior arrangement with Prussia, and he\r\nrefused the tempting offer. His choice has been variously\r\ncharacterised as one of common honesty and of uncommon magnanimity; at\r\nall events, it was of incalculable advantage to Prussia, which already\r\ngave signs of not being a particularly delicate-minded ally. When La\r\nMarmora asked Bismarck whether, in case Austria took the initiative of\r\nattacking Italy, Prussia would intervene, the answer was 'No.'\r\n\r\nThe three countries now pushed on their war preparations: Austria with\r\nless ardour than the others, as she still failed to more than faintly\r\nrealise her danger. The Italian army, which the opening of the year\r\nfound in a deplorably unserviceable condition, was rapidly placed on a\r\nwar-footing, and, considering the shortness of the time allowed for\r\nthe work, and the secrecy with which, at the outset, it had to be\r\nconducted, it is generally agreed that La Marmora produced surprising\r\nresults. As was natural in an army which, except for the old\r\nPiedmontese nucleus, might almost be called improvised, the weakest\r\npoints were the cavalry and the artillery. The infantry was good; not\r\nonly the picked corps of Bersaglieri, but also the line regiments were\r\nequal to any troops likely to be opposed to them. No one can see the\r\nfine appearance of a line regiment marching down the streets of an\r\nItalian town without receiving the impression that, however much the\r\nother branches of the service may have improved since the Sixties, the\r\nfondest hopes of Italy in case of war still lie in that common soldier\r\nwho best supported the rigours of the Russian snows.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the attention paid to the army was not extended to the\r\nfleet, which continued totally unready; nor was the organisation of\r\nthe volunteers carried out in an efficient manner. The excuse\r\nafterwards advanced was that not more than 15,000 enrolments were\r\nexpected, while the actual figure reached 35,000. Besides being from\r\nits very bulk less manageable than the 'few and good' of 1859, this\r\nmass of men was ill-provided with officers who could inspire and keep\r\ndiscipline. Garibaldi's own generals, Bixio, Medici, Cosenz and\r\nSirtori, were now all in the regular army, and therefore not free to\r\njoin him. He begged for the loan of a few regular officers, indicating\r\namongst other names that of Colonel Pallavicini, who commanded against\r\nhim at Aspromonte: a trait characteristic of the man. But this\r\nassistance, though promised, was not granted, and the same was the\r\ncase with the guns which were vainly asked for. Without charging La\r\nMarmora with a deliberate intention of neglecting the volunteers, it\r\nmust be owned that under the influence of the prejudice which holds\r\nirregular troops in small esteem, he did not do for them what ought to\r\nhave been done if their services were accepted at all.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Southern Army, excellent in discipline and equipment\r\nthough weak in numbers, was commanded up to the outbreak of the war by\r\nField-Marshal Benedek, but he was called to Vienna to take command of\r\nthe unfortunate army of operation against Prussia, and was succeeded\r\nin Italy by the Archduke Albrecht, with General Von John, an officer\r\nof the first capacity, as chief of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe numerical strength of the forces which could be put in the field\r\nhas been stated with startling divergence by different military\r\nwriters on the war, but every calculation gives the Italian side\r\n(exclusive of the volunteers) a superiority of not less than two to\r\none. The Austrian mobilised army has been reckoned at as low a figure\r\nas 63,000, certainly an understatement, as it appears that the\r\nArchduke mustered not less than 70,000 at the battle of Custoza. That\r\nhe mustered on that day every man he could produce is probably a fact.\r\nHad the Italian generals followed the same rule, however enormous\r\ntheir other errors might have been, they would have won. Of all\r\nconceivable faults in a military commander that which is the least\r\npardonable is the neglect to crush his antagonist by force of superior\r\nnumbers when he has them at his disposal. How many great military\r\nreputations have been built up, and justly built up, on the care never\r\nto meet an enemy without the odds being largely in your favour!\r\n\r\nFor obvious political reasons the King of Italy assumed the supreme\r\ncommand of the army, with General La Marmora as chief of the staff.\r\nCialdini had been offered the latter post, but he declined it,\r\nobjecting, it is said, to the arrangement by which the real head of\r\nthe army has no guarantee against the possible interference of its\r\nnominal head. When La Marmora went to the front, Baron Ricasoli took\r\nhis place as Prime Minister; Visconti-Venosta became Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs; and the Ministry of the Marine was offered to\r\nQuintino Sella, who refused it on the ground that he knew nothing of\r\nnaval matters. It was then offered to and accepted by a man who knew\r\nstill less, because he did not even know his own ignorance, Agostino\r\nDepretis, a Piedmontese advocate.\r\n\r\nBefore the commencement of hostilities a secret treaty was concluded\r\nbetween Napoleon III. and the Austrian Government, according to which\r\nVenetia was to be ceded to the Emperor for Italy, even if Austrian\r\narms were victorious both on the Mincio and on the Maine. Napoleon's\r\nreal purpose in this singular transaction is not perfectly clear; but\r\nhe was probably acting under a semi-romantic desire to have the\r\nappearance of completing his programme of freeing Italy from the Alps\r\nto the Adriatic which had been interrupted at Villafranca. In spite of\r\nhis enmity towards Italian unity, there is no reason to doubt that he\r\nwas in very few things as sincere as in the wish to see the Austrians\r\nout of Italy. His reckonings at this time were all founded on the\r\nassumption that Prussia would be defeated; he even seems to have had\r\nsome hopes of getting the Rhine bank in return for his good offices on\r\nbehalf of that Power with triumphant Austria. Be this as it may, he\r\ninspired the Italian Government (or rather La Marmora, for there were\r\nthen two Italian Governments, and the real one was on the Mincio) with\r\nhis own expectation of Prussian disasters, and it is possible that\r\nthis expectation had a material and unfavourable influence on the\r\nmanner of conducting the war in Italy.\r\n\r\nThrough the Prussian Minister at Florence, General La Marmora received\r\nthe draft of a plan of campaign which is known to have been prepared\r\nby Count Moltke; in it the great feature was a descent on the\r\nDalmatian coast. From an independent quarter he received another plan\r\nin which a descent on the east coast of the Adriatic was contemplated,\r\nthe main difference being that Istria, instead of Dalmatia, was\r\nproposed for the landing-point. This second plan was modestly\r\nsubmitted to him by Garibaldi, who was thus in substantial accord with\r\nthe Prussian strategist. The prospect which either of these plans\r\nopened was one of great fascination. What Italian can look across the\r\nsea to where the sun rises and forget that along that horizon lies a\r\nland colonised by Rome and guarded for four hundred years by Venice?\r\n\r\nIstria was marked out by Dante as the frontier province of Italy:\r\n\r\n  Si come a Pola presso del Quarnero\r\n  Che Italia chiude e i suoi termini bagna.\r\n\r\nIt forms, with the Trentino, what is called _Italia Irredenta_.\r\nAlthough the feeling of Italians for unredeemed Italy is not what\r\ntheir feeling was for Lombardy or Venetia, it is a mistake to imagine\r\nthat they have renounced all aspirations in that direction. Only\r\nfanatics of the worst kind would be disposed to attempt, in the\r\npresent situation, to win those provinces by force, but that has\r\nnothing to do with the matter. The aspiration exists and cannot help\r\nexisting. It has always been shared by patriots of all denominations.\r\nAn English statesman who called on Pius IX. was somewhat surprised by\r\nthe Pope saying that Italian unity was very well, but it was a pity it\r\ndid not include Trento and Trieste.\r\n\r\nThe case of Dalmatia is different; there the mass of the population is\r\nunquestionably of a non-Italian race, though that race is one which,\r\nwhenever left to itself, seems created to amalgamate with the Italian.\r\nSlav and Teuton are racially antagonistic, but the Slav falls into\r\nItalian ways, speaks the Italian language and mixes his blood with\r\nItalian blood: with what results Venice can tell. For more than two\r\nthousand years the civilisation of Dalmatia has been exclusively\r\nLatin; the Roman column points to the Venetian Campanile; all the\r\nproudest memories are gathered round the Lion of St Mark, which in\r\nevery town, almost in every village, recalls the splendid though not\r\nblameless suzerainty of the Serene Republic. The sky, the\r\nolive-groves, the wild pomegranates make us think of Salerno; by the\r\nspoken tongue we are often reminded of Tuscany, for few Italian\r\ndialects are so pure. The political subjection of the country to Italy\r\ndates from Augustus; its political subjection to Austria dates from\r\nNapoleon. Dalmatia, with the glorious little commonwealth of Ragusa,\r\nand the free city of Cattaro, was bartered away with Venice at Campo\r\nFormio; and as with Venice, so with Dalmatia, the Holy Alliance\r\nviolated its own principle of restoring the proe-Napoleonic state of\r\nthings and confirmed the sale.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, Austria did not ignore that her loss of\r\nterritory might exceed Venetia. The Archduke Albrecht, in his\r\nproclamation to his soldiers, appealed to them to protect their\r\nmothers, wives and sisters from being ruled by a foreign race.\r\n\r\nEven a successful raid upon Dalmatia or Istria need not have given\r\nthose districts to Italy, but it would have brought such an event\r\nwithin the range of a moderately strong political telescope. The Slavs\r\n(erected since into a party hostile to their Italian fellow-citizens\r\nby a fostering of Panslavism which may not, in the long run, prove\r\nsound policy for Austria) were then ready to make friends with anyone\r\nopposed to their actual rulers. They would not have been easy to\r\ngovern after an Italian invasion; still less easy to govern would the\r\nLatin element have been, which was and is _Italianissimo_. Since\r\nPrussia became the German Empire, she has set her face against Italian\r\nextension eastward, but in 1866, had her advice been intelligently\r\nacted upon, it might have generated facts the logic of which none\r\nwould have had the power to stay.\r\n\r\nMoltke's plan more than hinted at a march on Vienna by the Semmering,\r\nand this is what is supposed to have induced La Marmora to treat it with\r\nscorn. With the bogey of Prussia vanquished before his eyes, he\r\ndoubtless asked what the Italians would do at Vienna if they got there?\r\nHe put the plan in his pocket, and showed it neither to his staff nor to\r\nthe King, who would certainly have been attracted by it, as he had set\r\nhis heart on the volunteers, at least, crossing the Adriatic. With\r\nregard to the campaign at home, both Moltke and Garibaldi counselled\r\nturning the Quadrilateral in preference to a direct attack upon\r\nfortresses which had been proved impregnable except with the assistance\r\nof hunger, and at present they were better provisioned than in 1848. The\r\nturning of the Quadrilateral meant the adoption of a route into Venetia\r\nacross the Po below Mantua. An objection not without gravity to that\r\nroute was the unfavourable nature of the ground which, being marshy, is\r\nliable after heavy rains to become impassable. But against this\r\ndisadvantage had to be weighed the advantage of keeping out of the\r\nmouse-trap, the fatality of which needed no new demonstration.\r\n\r\nIn Italy it is common to hear it said that it was necessary to station\r\na large army on the Mincio to bar the Archduke's path to Milan. But\r\napart from the rumoured existence of a promise to the French Emperor\r\nnot to invade Lombardy, it was unlikely that so good a general as the\r\nArchduke would have taken his small army far from the security it\r\nenjoyed among the four fortresses which, if the worst came to the\r\nworst, assured him a safe line of retreat.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by La Marmora is vaguely said to have been that which\r\nwas prepared by the French and Sardinian staffs for use in 1859, had\r\nthe war been continued. But in what it really consisted is not to this\r\nday placed beyond dispute. The army, roughly speaking, was divided\r\ninto halves; one (the larger) half under the King and La Marmora was\r\nto operate on the Mincio; the other, under Cialdini, was to operate on\r\nthe lower Po. It is supposed that one of these portions was intended\r\nto act as a blind to deceive the enemy as to the movements of the\r\nother portion; the undecided question is, which was meant to be the\r\nprincipal and which the accessory?\r\n\r\nThe volunteers were thrown against the precipices of the Tridentine\r\nmountains, where a detachment of the regular army, well-armed and\r\nproperly supplied with artillery, would have been better suited for\r\nthe work. The Garibaldian headquarters was at Salò on the Lake of\r\nGarda. Less than half of the 35,000 volunteers who appear upon paper,\r\nwere ever ready to be sent to the front. It was widely said that only\r\npatriotism prevented Garibaldi from throwing up his command, so\r\ndissatisfied was he with the conduct of affairs.\r\n\r\nPrussia invaded Hanover and Saxony on the 16th of June, and declared\r\nwar with Austria on the 21st, one day after the Italian declaration of\r\nwar had been delivered to the Archduke Albrecht. On the 23rd La\r\nMarmora's army began to cross the Mincio. It consisted of three _corps\r\nd'armée_ under the command of Generals Durando, Cucchiari and Delia\r\nRocca, each corps containing four divisions. The force under Cialdini\r\nwas composed of eight divisions forming one _corps d'armée._ An\r\nItalian military writer rates the numbers at 133,000 and 82,000\r\nrespectively. La Marmora acquired the belief that the Archduke's\r\nattention was absorbed by Cialdini's movements on the Po, and that his\r\nown operations on the Mincio would pass unobserved.\r\n\r\nWhile the Italian commander had no information of what was going on in\r\nthe enemy's camp, the Archduke's intelligence department was so\r\nefficient that he knew quite well the disposition of both Italian\r\narmies. Cialdini's advance, if he meant to advance, was checked by\r\nfloods. On the night of the 23rd most of La Marmora's force bivouacked\r\non the left (Venetian) bank of the Mincio. No reconnaissances were made;\r\neveryone supposed that the Austrians were still beyond the Adige, and\r\nthat they intended to stay there. The King slept at Goito.\r\n\r\nBefore the early dawn next morning the whole Italian army of the\r\nMincio had orders to advance. The soldiers marched with heavy\r\nknapsacks and empty stomachs, and with no more precautions than in\r\ntime of peace. The Austrian Archduke was in the saddle at four a.m.,\r\nand watched from an eminence the moving clouds of dust which announced\r\nthe approach of his unsuspecting foe.\r\n\r\nLa Marmora's intention had been to occupy the heights of Santa\r\nGiustina, Sona and Somma Campagna, but the Archduke anticipated his\r\ndesign, and while the Italians were moving from the Mincio, the\r\nAustrians were ranging themselves in those positions. At half-past\r\nfive on the midsummer Sunday morning, the Austrian advance guard led\r\nby Colonel Pulz came up with Prince Humbert's division near\r\nVillafranca. The battle began dramatically, with a charge of the\r\nsplendid Polish and Hungarian Hussars, who dashed their horses against\r\nthe Italian squares, in one of which, opportunely formed for his\r\nshelter, was the gallant heir to the throne. Bixio's division was also\r\nengaged in this prelude, which augured not ill for the Italians, since\r\nat about eight o'clock Pulz received the Archduke's orders to retire.\r\n\r\nThe first hours of the battle were spent in fortuitous encounters\r\nalong the extensive chain of hillocks which La Marmora had intended to\r\noccupy. As the Italians approached each position they found it in the\r\npossession of a strong force of the enemy. On the right, however,\r\nCustoza and the heights between it and Somma Campagna had not been\r\noccupied by the Austrians. Here La Marmora placed the flower of his\r\narmy, the Sardinian and Lombard Grenadiers, the latter commanded by\r\nPrince Amedeo. The fighting continued through the day over very\r\nwidely distributed ground, but from about nine in the morning the\r\nsupreme interest was concentrated at and near Custoza, in which the\r\nArchduke promptly detected the turning-point of the battle. To wrest\r\nCustoza from the hold of the Italians was to the Austrians on the 24th\r\nof June 1866, what the taking of the crest of Solferino had been to\r\nthe French on the 24th of June 1859. La Marmora in person led the\r\nGrenadiers into action; they proved worthy of their reputation, but\r\nafter losing a great many men, Prince Amedeo being among the wounded,\r\nthey were obliged to retreat. At about midday, however, the Italian\r\nprospects improved so much that in the opinion of Austrian military\r\nwriters, with moderate reinforcements they would have had a strong\r\nprobability of winning the battle. La Marmora saw the importance of\r\ngetting fresh troops into the field, but, instead of sending for the\r\ndivisions under Bixio and Prince Humbert, which since eight a.m. had\r\nbeen fretting in inaction close by, at Villafranca, he rode himself to\r\nGoito, a great distance away, to look after the reserves belonging to\r\nthe 2nd _corps d'armée_; a task which any staff officer could have\r\nperformed as well. This inexplicable proceeding left the army without\r\na commander-in-chief. The generals of division followed their\r\nindividual inspirations, Govone, Pianel and Cugia especially\r\ndistinguishing themselves: it is sad to think that death has removed\r\nthese three officers from the Italian ranks. But the Austrians fatally\r\ngained ground, and as the afternoon closed in the Archduke began to\r\nfeel sure that the Italian reinforcements whose arrival he had so much\r\nfeared, were never coming. He therefore prepared for the final effort\r\nwhich was to give him the well-deserved honours of the day. Towards\r\nseven o'clock in the evening, his soldiers succeeded in storming the\r\nheights of Custoza, and Austria could write a second battle of that\r\nname among her victories.\r\n\r\nThe Italians lost 720 killed, 3112 wounded and 3608 prisoners. The\r\nAustrian loss was 960 killed, 3690 wounded and 1000 prisoners. Both\r\nsides were much tried by the scorching midsummer sun, but the Italians\r\nlaboured under the additional drawback of having to fight fasting. In\r\nhis report, the Archduke Albrecht mentioned that the prisoners said\r\nthey had not tasted food for twenty-four hours. In the same report, he\r\ndid ample justice to the courage of the Italian soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the Archduke fought Custoza with not less,\r\nprobably with rather more, than 70,000 men. The force which La Marmora\r\nplaced in the field was actually inferior in number. The divisions of\r\nBixio and Prince Humbert were kept doing nothing all day at a stone's\r\nthrow from the scene of action. Of the whole 2nd _corps d'armée_ only\r\na trifling detachment ever reached the ground. Inexplicably little use\r\nwas made of the Italian cavalry.\r\n\r\nThis bungling had lost the battle, but the fact that on the morrow,\r\nsix divisions of the army of the Mincio were practically fresh, might\r\nhave suggested to a general of enterprise to try again, since it was\r\nknown that the Archduke had not a single new man to fall back on. And\r\nthere was Cialdini on the Po with his eight divisions that had not\r\nbeen engaged at all. But, instead of adopting a spirited course, the\r\nItalian authorities gave way to unreasoning panic. It appears,\r\nunfortunately, that the King was the first to be overcome by this\r\nmoral vertigo. The long and fiercely discussed question of who\r\ntelegraphed to Cialdini: 'Irreparable disaster; cover the capital,'\r\nseems to have been settled since that general's death in 1892. It is\r\nnow alleged that the telegram, the authorship of which was disowned by\r\nLa Marmora, was signed by the King's adjutant, Count Verasio di\r\nCastiglione. Cialdini obeyed the order and fell back on Modena.\r\nWhether he was bound to obey an almost anonymous communication signed\r\nby an irresponsible officer is a moot point; it is reported that he\r\nrepented having done so to the last day of his life.\r\n\r\nA great event now happened across the Alps; one of the decisive\r\nbattles of the world was lost and won on the 5th of July at Sadowa\r\nnear Königgrätz in Bohemia. The fate of Europe was shaped on that day\r\nfor decades, if not for centuries. Of the immediate results, the first\r\nwas the scattering to the wind of all calculations based upon a long\r\ncontinuance of the war, the issue of which, as far as Prussia was\r\nconcerned, could not be regarded as doubtful. In respect to Italy,\r\nAustria's first thought was to prevent her from taking a revenge for\r\nCustoza. She attempted to compass this by ceding Venetia to Napoleon\r\ntwo days after Sadowa. It was making a virtue of necessity, as she was\r\nbound in any case to cede it at the conclusion of the war; but as the\r\nsecret of the treaty had been well kept, the step caused great\r\nsurprise, and in Italy, where the public mind had leapt from profound\r\ndiscouragement to buoyant hope, the impression was one of\r\nembarrassment and mortification. Italy was distinctly precluded by her\r\nengagement with Prussia from accepting Napoleon's invitation to\r\nconclude a separate peace. Meanwhile, Austria gained by the move, as\r\nit set her at liberty to recall the larger part of her troops from\r\nVenetia for the defence of Vienna. Her honour did not require her to\r\ncontest the ground in a province which she had already given away.\r\nWhen Cialdini, at the head of the reorganised Italian army of which he\r\nnow held the chief command, advanced across the Po to Padua, he found\r\nthe path practically open.\r\n\r\nIt was still possible for Italy to accomplish two things which would\r\nhave in a great measure retrieved her _prestige_. The first was to\r\noccupy the Trentino; the second was to destroy the Austrian fleet.\r\nWith the means at her disposal she ought to have been able to do both.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier phases of Italian liberation, no one disputed that if\r\nLombardy and Venetia were lost to the Empire the Tridentine province,\r\nwedged in as it is between them, would follow suit. When, in 1848,\r\nLord Palmerston offered his services as mediator between Austria and\r\nrevolted Italy, it was on a minimum basis of a frontier north of\r\nTrento. The arguments for the retention of Trieste--that Austria had\r\nmade it what it was; that Germany needed it as a seaport, etc.--were\r\ninapplicable here; and even after the defeat of Custoza, an occupation\r\nof the Trentino, had it happened in conjunction with a naval victory,\r\nwould have opened a fair prospect to possession. But there was no time\r\nto lose, and much time was lost by ordering Garibaldi to descend to\r\nthe southern extremity of the lake of Garda to 'cover Brescia' from an\r\nimaginary attack. When the fear of an Austrian invasion subsided, and\r\nGaribaldi returned to the mountains, he endeavoured to re-take the\r\nposition of Monte Suello which he had previously held, but the attempt\r\nfailed. The volunteers were forced to retire with great loss, and the\r\nchief himself was wounded. On the 16th of July the volunteers renewed\r\ntheir advance up the mountain ravines, and, after taking Fort Ampola,\r\nreached the village of Bezzecca, where they were attacked by the\r\nAustrians early on the 21st. Each side claimed that sanguinary day as\r\na victory; the Garibaldians remained masters of the ground, but the\r\nAustrians, in retiring, took with them a large number of prisoners.\r\nThe losses of the volunteers on this and other occasions when they\r\nwere engaged were disproportionately heavy. They were spendthrift of\r\ntheir lives, but in war, and especially in mountain warfare, caution\r\nis as needful as courage, and in caution they were so deficient that\r\nthey were always being surprised. General Kuhn's numerically inferior\r\nforce of tried marksmen, supported by good artillery and favoured by\r\nground which may be described as one great natural fortification, had\r\nsucceeded up till now in holding the Trentino, but his position was\r\nbecoming critical, because while Garibaldi sought to approach Trento\r\nfrom the west, Medici with 10,000 men detached from the main army at\r\nPadua, was ascending the Venetian valleys that lead to the same\r\ndestination from the east. Kuhn was therefore on the point of being\r\ntaken between two fires when the armistice saved him.\r\n\r\nThese operations on the Tridentine frontier, though not without a real\r\nimportance, passed almost unnoticed in the excitement which attended\r\nthe first calamitous appearance of United Italy as a naval power.\r\n\r\nWhen invited to assume the command of the Italian fleet, Admiral\r\nPersano twice refused; it was only when the King pressed upon him a\r\nthird invitation that he weakly accepted a charge to which he felt\r\nhimself unequal. He had been living in retirement for some years, and\r\nneither knew nor was known by most of the officers and men whom he was\r\nnow to command. The fleet under his orders comprised thirty-three\r\nvessels, of which twelve were ironclads. The Austrian fleet numbered\r\ntwenty-seven ships, including seven ironclads. When the war broke out,\r\nboth fleets were far from ready for active service; but, while the\r\nAustrian Admiral Tegethoff said nothing, but worked night and day at\r\nPola to make his ships and his men serviceable, Persano despatched\r\nhourly lamentable reports to the Minister of Marine, without finding\r\nthe way to bring about a change for the better. He wasted time in\r\nminutiæ, and took into his head to paint all the Italian ships a\r\nlight grey, which was of the greatest use to the Austrians in the\r\nbattle of Lissa, as it enabled them to distinguish between them and\r\ntheir own dark-coloured ships.\r\n\r\nAfter long delaying at Taranto, Persano brought his fleet to Ancona;\r\nand, two days later, Tegethoff appeared in front of that town--not\r\nknowing, it seems, that the Italian squadrons had arrived. Tegethoff\r\nwas bound on a simple reconnaissance, and, after firing a few shots,\r\nhe sailed away. On this occasion, Persano issued orders so hesitating\r\nand confused that the Austrian admiral must have correctly gauged the\r\ncapacity of the man opposed to him, while the superior officers of the\r\nItalian fleet were filled with little less than dismay. A strong\r\neffort was made to induce Depretis to supersede Persano then and\r\nthere; he promised to do so, but it is said that the fear of offending\r\nthe King prevented him. Instead, he set about showering instructions\r\non the admiral, the worth of which may be easily imagined. The\r\nmistrust felt by the fleet in its commander invaded all ranks; and if\r\nit did not break out in open insubordination, it deprived officers and\r\nmen of all confidence in the issue of the campaign.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Persano would have stayed quietly at Ancona, but the\r\nimperative orders of a cabinet council, presided over by the King,\r\nforced him to take some action. Against the advice of Admiral Albini,\r\nbut in agreement with another admiral, Vacca, Persano decided to\r\nattack the fortified island of Lissa, on the Dalmatian coast. Though\r\nLissa is a strong position, the usual comparison of it with Gibraltar\r\nis exaggerated. It ought to have been possible to land the Italian\r\ntroops which Persano had with him under cover of his guns, and to take\r\nthe island before Tegethoff came up. The surf caused by the rough\r\nweather, to which he chiefly attributed his failure, would not have\r\nproved an insuperable obstacle had the ships' crews been exercised in\r\nlanding troops under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nPersano reached Lissa on the morning of the 18th of July, and began a\r\ntremendous bombardment of the forts, which, though answered with the\r\nhighest spirit by the Austrians, did most deadly damage to their\r\nbatteries. In fact, by the evening, except one or two at a high\r\nelevation, they were practically silenced. At six o'clock Captain\r\nSaint Bon took the _Formidabile_ into the narrow harbour to silence\r\nthe inner works: a murderous fire rained on the corvette from Fort\r\nWellington, which was too high for the Italian guns to get it into\r\nrange. Though Saint Bon's attempt was not successful, the Italians had\r\neffected most of what they aimed at, and might have effected the rest\r\nhad they continued the bombardment through the night, and so given the\r\nAustrians no time to repair their batteries, but at sunset Persano\r\nwithdrew his fleet to a distance of eight miles. The Austrians worked\r\nall night at mending the batteries that could still be used, and hoped\r\nin the coming of Tegethoff.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph cable connecting the neighbouring island of Lesina with\r\nthe coast, and so with Pola, had been cut by Persano's orders; but\r\neither (as the writer was told on the spot last year) there was another\r\nline that was not noticed, or before the cable was destroyed the\r\nofficial in charge got off a message to Tegethoff, informing him of the\r\narrival of the Italian fleet. An answer, to the effect that Tegethoff\r\nwould come to the rescue as soon as possible, fell into the hands of the\r\nItalians, but Persano appears not to have believed in it.\r\n\r\nThe 19th was spent in attempts at landing, which the surf and the\r\nenergetic play of the repaired batteries rendered fruitless. The\r\nbombardment was renewed, but it was not well conducted. Saint Bon, who\r\nmade another plucky entry into the harbour, was unsupported, and,\r\nafter an hour's fighting, he was obliged to retire, his ship having\r\nsuffered severely.\r\n\r\nNext morning there was a blinding summer storm, but at about eight\r\no'clock the _Esploratore_ distinguished the forms of ironclads through\r\nthe rain, and signalled to Persano: 'Suspicious vessels in sight.'\r\nPersano answered: 'No doubt they are fishing-boats.' When obliged to\r\nadmit the truth he gave the order to unite, his ships being scattered\r\nin all directions with everything on board at sixes and sevens. The\r\ntroops which had again been attempting to land, were in boats, tossed\r\nabout by the heavy sea. The surprise was complete.\r\n\r\nPersano fought the battle of Lissa with nine ironclads, most of which\r\nhad received some injuries during the bombardment. He ordered his\r\nwooden ships to keep out of the action altogether. Tegethoff had seven\r\nironclads and fourteen wooden vessels, all of which he turned to the\r\nbest account.\r\n\r\nJust before the battle Persano left his flagship, the _Re_ _d'Italia_,\r\nand went on board the _Affondatore_. By somebody's mistake it was a\r\nlong time before the _Affondatore_ hoisted the admiral's flag, and\r\nthe fleet continued to look to the _Re d'Italia_ for signals when he\r\nwas no longer on board.\r\n\r\nContrary to a well-known rule in naval science, Persano formed his\r\nsquadron in single file, and quite at the beginning of the battle\r\nTegethoff managed to break the line by dashing in between the first\r\nand second division whilst they were going at full speed, and under a\r\nfurious cannonade from their guns. This daring operation placed him\r\nin the middle of the Italian ironclads, which, well directed, could\r\nhave closed round him and destroyed him, but they were not directed\r\neither well nor ill--they were not directed at all. Persano put up\r\ncontradictory signals, most of which were not seen, and those which\r\nwere seen meant nothing. The plan followed by Admiral Tegethoff may be\r\nbest described in his own words: 'It was hard to make out friend from\r\nfoe, so I just rammed away at anything I saw painted grey.' Two\r\nItalian vessels had been already damaged, but not vitally injured, by\r\nthe _Ferdinand Max_, when in the dense smoke a vast wall of grey\r\nappeared close to the bows of the Austrian flagship, which, to the cry\r\nof 'Ram her!' put on full steam and crashed into the enemy's flank.\r\nThe shock was so great that the crew of the _Max_ were thrown about in\r\nindescribable confusion. The Italian ship was the _Re d'Italia,_ the\r\nflagship which did not carry the admiral. She quivered for one, two,\r\nsome say for three minutes in her death agony, and then went down in\r\ntwo hundred fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nAfter the _Re d'Italia_ was struck, one of her seamen, thinking to\r\nassert a claim to pity, began to lower her flag, but a young officer\r\npushed him aside and hoisted it again; so the great ship sank with her\r\ncolours flying. The incident was noticed by the Austrians, who spoke\r\nof it in feeling terms. Willing enough were they to help, for after\r\nthe first cheer of triumph they felt sick with horror at their own\r\nwork, the fearful work of modern naval warfare. There were 550 men on\r\nboard the doomed ship. Tegethoff shouted for the boats to be lowered,\r\nand signalled to the despatch boat _Elisabeth_ to pick up all she\r\ncould, but two Italian ironclads were bearing down upon him, and\r\nlittle could be done to save the drowning multitude either by the\r\nAustrians or by their own people. Persano did not know of the\r\ndisaster till some hours after it happened.\r\n\r\nThe sea had scarcely closed over the _Re d'Italia_ when another\r\nmisfortune occurred; the gunboat _Palestro_ took fire. Her captain,\r\nAlfredo Cappellini, disembarked the sick and wounded, but remained\r\nhimself with the rest of the crew, endeavouring to put out the fire.\r\nThe ship blew up at 2.30 p.m., and over two hundred perished with her.\r\n\r\nPersano, still on the _Affondatore_, now led his fleet out of action,\r\nand it was the first time he had led it during the day. Tegethoff\r\ngazed after the vanishing squadron with anxiety, as had Persano turned\r\nand renewed the battle from a distance, he could have revenged his\r\ndefeat at close quarters without receiving a shot, owing to the longer\r\nrange of his guns. But for such an operation skilful manoeuvring was\r\nwanted, and also, perhaps, more precision in firing than the Italian\r\ngunners possessed. At any rate, Persano had no mind for new\r\nadventures. He took what remained of his fleet straight back to\r\nAncona, where the _Affondatore_ sank in the harbour from injuries\r\nreceived during the battle. For three days the Italian people were\r\ntold that they had won a victory, then the bitter truth was known. The\r\nadmiral, tried before the Senate, was deprived of his rank and command\r\nin the Italian navy. The politician who, when convinced of his\r\nunfitness, yet had not the nerve to remove him from his post, died,\r\nfull of years and honours, Prime Minister of Italy.\r\n\r\nLissa was fought on the 20th of July. On the 25th, Prussia signed the\r\npreliminaries of peace with Austria without consulting her ally, who,\r\nif unfortunate, had been eminently loyal to her. Thus the whole forces\r\nof the Empire, not less than 350,000 men, were let loose to fall upon\r\nItaly. Such was the wrathful disappointment of the Italians at their\r\ndefeats by land and sea, that if a vote had been taken they would\r\npossibly have decided for a renewal of the struggle. Ricasoli was\r\ninclined to risk war rather than bow to the Austrian demand that the\r\nevacuation of the Trentino should precede the conclusion of an\r\narmistice. At this crisis, La Marmora acted as a true patriot in\r\nforcing the hand of the Ministry by ordering the recall of the troops\r\nand sending General Petitti to treat directly with the Austrian\r\nmilitary authorities. 'They will say that we have betrayed the\r\ncountry,' said the King in the interview in which these measures were\r\nconcerted; to which La Marmora answered: 'Come what may, I take the\r\nwhole responsibility upon myself.' 'This is too much,' replied Victor\r\nEmmanuel with tears in his eyes; 'I, also, will have my part in it.'\r\nIn which brief dialogue the character of the two men stands revealed;\r\nmen who might fall short in talent or in judgment, not in honour.\r\n\r\nThe volunteers, so many of whose comrades lay dead along the mountain\r\ngorges--who believed, too, that they were in sight of the reward of\r\ntheir sacrifices--were thrown into a ferment, almost into a revolt by\r\nthe order to retreat. They had expected in a day or two to shake hands\r\nwith Medici, who, after some hard fighting, was within a march of\r\nTrento. The order was explicit: instant evacuation of the enemy's\r\nterritory. Garibaldi, to whom from first to last had fallen an\r\nungrateful part, took up his pen and wrote the laconic telegram:\r\n'Obbedisco.' 'I have obeyed,' he said to the would-be mutineers, 'do\r\nyou obey likewise.' Someone murmured 'Rome.' 'Yes,' said the chief,\r\n'we will march on Rome.'\r\n\r\nThe armistice was signed at Cormons on the 12th of August, and the\r\ntreaty of peace on the 3rd of October at Vienna. Italy received Venice\r\nfrom the hands of the French Emperor, whose interference since the\r\nbeginning of the campaign had incensed Prussia against her ally\r\nwithout benefiting the Power which he affected and, perhaps, really\r\nmeant to serve. Italy would have received Venetia without his\r\ninterposition, for besides the Prussian obligation to claim it for\r\nher, Austria had no further wish to keep it. Despite the fact that\r\nItalian populations still remained under the rule of the Empire, the\r\nmelancholy book of Austrian dominion in Italy might be fairly said to\r\nbe closed forever. A new era was dawning for the House of Hapsburg,\r\nwhich was to show that, unlike the Bourbons, it could learn and\r\nunlearn.\r\n\r\nThe comedy of the cession of Venice to Napoleon was enacted between\r\nGeneral Le Boeuf and General Alemann, the Austrian military\r\ncommandant. Among other formalities, the French delegate went the\r\nround of the museums and galleries to see that everything was in its\r\nplace. Suddenly he came upon a most suspicious blank. 'A picture is\r\nmissing here,' he said. 'It is, blandly assented the Austrian officer.\r\n'Well, but it must be sent back immediately--where is it?' 'In the\r\nLouvre.'\r\n\r\nAt last Austrians and French departed, and Italy shook off her\r\nmourning, for however it had come about, the great object which had\r\ncost so much blood, so many tears, was attained; the stranger was\r\ngone!\r\n\r\nOut of 642,000 votes, only 69 were recorded against the union of\r\nVenetia with the Italian kingdom. When the plebiscite was presented\r\nto the King, he said: 'This is the greatest day of my life: Italy is\r\nmade, though not complete.' On the 7th of November he entered Venice,\r\nand of all the pageants that greeted him in the hundred cities of\r\nItaly, the welcome of the Bride of the Adriatic was, if not the most\r\nimposing, certainly the fairest to see. More touching, however, than\r\nthe glorious beauty of the Piazza San Marco and the Grand Canal in\r\ntheir rich adornment, was the universal decoration of the poorest\r\nquarters, which were all flagged and festooned so thickly that little\r\ncould be seen of the stones of Venice. One poor cobbler, however,\r\nliving at the end of a blind alley, had no flag, no garland to deck\r\nhis abode: he had therefore pasted three strips of coloured paper,\r\nred, white and green, over his door, inscribing on the middle strip\r\nthese words, which in their sublime simplicity merit to be rescued\r\nfrom oblivion: 'O mia cara Italia, voglio ma non posso fare più per\r\nte.'\r\n\r\nThe Iron Crown of the Lombard Kings of Italy, which the Austrians had\r\ntaken away in 1859, was brought back and restored to the Cathedral of\r\nMonza. Less presumptuous than Napoleon, Victor Emmanuel never placed\r\nthe mystical fillet upon his head, but it was carried after his coffin\r\nto the Pantheon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE LAST CRUSADE\r\n\r\n1867\r\n\r\nThe French leave Rome--Garibaldi's Arrest and Escape--The Second\r\nFrench Intervention--Monte Rotondo--Mentana.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words of Victor Emmanuel to the Venetian Deputation contained a\r\nriddle easy to solve: what was meant by the 'completion' of Italy was\r\nthe establishment of her capital on the Tiber. In most minds there was\r\nan intense belief in the inevitability of the union of Rome with the\r\nrest of Italy, but no one saw how it was to be brought about. What\r\nsoothsayer foretold Sédan?\r\n\r\nIn the first period after the war, domestic difficulties fixed the\r\nattention of the Italian Government on the present rather than on the\r\nfuture. An insurrection at Palermo assumed threatening proportions\r\nowing to the smallness of the garrison, and might have had still more\r\nserious consequences but for the courage and presence of mind shown by\r\nthe Syndic, the young Marquis di Rudini. Crime and poverty, republican\r\nhankerings, the irritation of the priesthood at recent legislation,\r\nand most of all, the feeling that little had been done since 1860 to\r\nrealise the millennium then promised, contributed to the outbreak\r\nwhich was quelled when troops arrived from the mainland, but the\r\nministers were blamed for not having taken better precautions against\r\nits occurrence. Another stumbling-block lay in the path of Ricasoli,\r\nnamely, the application of the law for the suppression of religious\r\nhouses, and the expropriation of ecclesiastical property. After an\r\nunsuccessful endeavour to cope with it, he dissolved the Chamber, but\r\nthe new Parliament proved no more willing to support his measures,\r\nwhich were of the nature of a compromise, than the old one, and he\r\nfinally resigned office. He was succeeded by Urban Rattazzi, under\r\nwhose administration a measure was passed which, though drastic in\r\nappearance, has not prevented the re-establishment of a great many\r\nconvents of which the property was bought in under the name of\r\nprivate individuals. Every Catholic country has seen the necessity\r\nsooner or later of putting a check to the increase of monasticism, but\r\nit may be a matter of regret that in Italy, the toleration granted to\r\nthe learned community of Monte Cassino was not extended to more of the\r\nhistoric monasteries. The abstention of the Clerical party from the\r\nvoting urns deprived them of an influence which, on such points as\r\nthese, they might have exercised legitimately and perhaps\r\nbeneficially. To that abstention, the disequilibrium of Italian\r\npolitical life, from first to last, is largely due.\r\n\r\nThe time allowed to the French under the September Convention for the\r\nevacuation of Rome expired in December 1866, and at the opening of the\r\nnew year, for the first time since 1849, the Eternal City was without\r\na garrison in the service of a foreign Power. While executing their\r\nengagement, the French Government took occasion to say that they kept\r\ntheir hands perfectly free as concerned future action. The anomalous\r\nobligations of the September Convention now came into force, and it\r\nwas not long before their inconvenience was felt. Had Ricasoli\r\nremained at the head of affairs the _status quo_ might have lasted for\r\na time; because, although he was an unflinching opponent of the\r\nTemporal Power, he would have made it clear that since the Convention\r\nexisted he meant to respect it, and to make others respect it. He had\r\nshown that he could dare, but that was when he bore himself the whole\r\nresponsibility of his daring. He was not the man to tolerate heroic\r\nimprudence in others with the mental reservation of owning or\r\ndisowning the results, as might prove convenient. Rattazzi, on the\r\nother hand, was believed to answer very closely to this description;\r\nand patriots who were willing to bear all the blame in case of\r\nfailure and yield all the praise in case of success, began once more\r\nto speculate on the profit to the national cause which might be\r\nextracted from the peculiarities of his character. Aspromonte, that\r\nshould have placed them on their guard, had the contrary effect, for\r\nit was supposed that the Prime Minister was very anxious to wipe that\r\nstain from his reputation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Party of Action considered that, for the present,\r\nthe wisest course was to wait and watch the development of events.\r\nThis was Mazzini's personal view, but Garibaldi, almost alone in his\r\ndissent, did not share it. Impelled partly, no doubt, by the\r\nimpatience of a man who sees the years going by and his own life\r\nebbing away without the realisation of its dearest dream, but partly\r\nalso by the deliberate belief that the political situation offered\r\nsome favourable features which might not soon be repeated, Garibaldi\r\ndecided to take the field in the autumn of 1867. His friends, who one\r\nand all tried to dissuade him, found him immovable. It is too much to\r\nsay that he expected assistance from the Government, but that he hoped\r\nto draw Rattazzi after him is scarcely doubtful, and he had good\r\nreason for the hope.\r\n\r\nIn Rattazzi's own version and defence of his policy, it is set forth\r\nthat before the die was cast he did all that was humanly possible to\r\nprevent the expedition, but that having failed, he intended sending the\r\nItalian army over the frontier in the wake of the broken-loose\r\ncondottiere. Though this gives a colour of consistency to his conduct,\r\nit is not satisfactory as an explanation, and still less as an apology.\r\n\r\nGeneral La Marmora, who had always opposed the Convention, though he\r\nbelonged to the party which made it, once declared that 200,000 men\r\nwould not be sufficient to hold the Papal frontier against a guerilla\r\ninvasion. True as this may be, it is impossible to resist the\r\nconclusion that a minister who had resolutely made up his mind to\r\nprevent any attempt from being made would not have acted as Rattazzi\r\nacted. The Prime Minister thought that he was imitating Cavour, but in\r\nreality he simply imitated the pendulum of a clock.\r\n\r\nRattazzi's taste was for intrigue rather than for adventure in the\r\ngrand sense. An adventurous minister would have accelerated the\r\nenterprise to the utmost, in secret or not in secret, and would then\r\nhave preceded Garibaldi to Rome before the Clerical party in France\r\nhad time to force Napoleon to act. The rest could have been left to\r\nthe Roman people. What they did in 1870 they would have done in 1867;\r\nthey were ready to acclaim any conquering liberator; they were not\r\nready to make a revolution on their own account, and with all their\r\nleaders in prison or in exile, they are hardly to be blamed for it.\r\nFor such a policy Italy might have pleaded that necessity which knows\r\nno law. Everybody allowed that if Garibaldi went to Rome the Italians\r\nmust go there too: the very security of the Pope demanded it--at\r\nleast, he said so. As to the first part of the programme, complicity\r\nin the preparation of the movement, it would have been an infringement\r\nof the Convention, but had France kept the Convention? French bishops\r\nrecruited soldiers for the Pope in every province of France, and the\r\nAntibes Legion was drawn, officers and men, from the French army. When\r\nsome of the men deserted, the French War Office sent General Dumont to\r\nRome to look to the discipline of the regiment. Those who argued that\r\nthe spirit, if not the letter, of the agreement had been already\r\nevaded, could make out a good case for their position.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that this is what Rattazzi's policy would have\r\nbeen, but for the opposition of the King. Were it so, the minister\r\nought to have resigned at the beginning of the proceedings instead of\r\nat the end. That in the ultimate crisis it was the King who prevented\r\nthe troops from moving is a fact, but the propitious moment was then\r\npast and gone. 'Do as you like, but do it quickly,' Napoleon said to\r\nCavour when Cialdini was to be sent to the Cattolica. And it was done\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nAfter letting Garibaldi make what arrangements and issue what\r\nmanifestoes he chose for six weeks, Rattazzi suddenly had him arrested\r\nat Sinalunga on the 23rd of September. The only consequence was fatal\r\ndelay; not knowing what to do with their prisoner, the Government\r\nshipped him to Caprera. Personally he was perfectly free; no\r\nconditions were imposed; but nine men-of-war were despatched to the\r\nisland to sweep the seas of erratic heroes. In spite of which,\r\nGaribaldi escaped in a canoe on the 14th of October.\r\n\r\nThat night, between sundown and moonrise, there was only one hour's\r\ndark, but it sufficed the fugitive to make good his passage from\r\nCaprera to the island of Maddalena. A strong south-east breeze was\r\nblowing; the waves, however, were rather favourable to the venture, as\r\nthey hid the frail bark from any eyes that might be peering through\r\nthe night. Garibaldi did not fear; he had often put out on this\r\nterrible sea when lashed to fury to succour sailors in their peril. On\r\nreaching Maddalena he scrambled over the rocks to the house of an\r\nEnglish lady who was delighted to give him hospitality. Next evening\r\nhe proceeded to Sardinia, from which, after several adventures, he\r\nsailed for the Tuscan coast in a boat held in readiness by his\r\nson-in-law, Canzio. And so, to the amazement of friends and foes, he\r\narrived in Florence, where, before many hours were past, he was\r\nharanguing the enthusiastic crowd from a balcony.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi had escaped, but the mischief done to the movement by the\r\nloss of nearly a month could not be remedied. Although large armed\r\nbands under Acerbi, Nicotera and Menotti Garibaldi were gathered near\r\nViterbo, as usually happened in the absence of the chief, nothing\r\neffectual was done. But it was in Paris that the delay brought the\r\nmost ruinous results.\r\n\r\nThe history of the second French expedition to Rome will never be\r\nsatisfactorily told, because, while the outward circumstances point\r\none way, the inward probabilities point another. Napoleon had said\r\nthat if the Convention were not observed he would intervene, and he\r\ndid intervene; nothing could seem simpler. Yet it is not doubtful\r\nthat, in his inmost heart, he was wishing day and night that something\r\nwould turn up to extricate him from the Roman dilemma once for all.\r\nWhile he hesitated, the Clerical party in France did not hesitate. Not\r\na moment was thrown away by them. Towards the middle of October, it\r\nwas reported that 'half royalist and half Catholic France will be in\r\nRome in the course of the week. Men with names belonging to the\r\nproudest French nobility--the De Lusignans, De Clissons, De Lumleys,\r\nDe Bourbon-Chalens, etc., are chartering vessels, arriving in Rome by\r\nscores and hundreds, and hence hurrying to the front to take their\r\nplaces as privates in the Zouaves.' That, however, does not describe\r\nthe most important sphere of their activity which was the\r\nante-chamber, nay, the boudoir of St Cloud. In that palace, three\r\nyears later to be rased to the ground by the Germans, the net was\r\nwoven which every day closed tighter and tighter round Napoleon, till\r\nhe was enveloped in its meshes past escape. Ever since De Morny's\r\ndeath, the influence nearest the throne had been increasing in\r\nstrength; it is needless to say in which direction it was exercised.\r\nNapoleon was ill; Maximilian's ghost floated over him; he felt his\r\npower slipping from his hands in spite of the noise and show of the\r\nExhibition, which was supposed to mark its zenith. The words of the\r\nold pact with the Royalists buzzed in his ears: 'Do you keep the Pope\r\non his throne, and we will keep you on yours.' And he yielded.\r\n\r\nThe 'principle' of French intervention was adopted by the council of\r\nministers on the 17th of October. Then, and not till then, Rattazzi\r\ndecided to send the Italian troops over the frontier. On finding that\r\nneither the King nor several of his colleagues in the ministry would\r\nsupport him, he resigned office on the 19th of the month.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day after that Garibaldi appeared in Florence. As there\r\nwas no ministry, no one thought it his business to interfere with him.\r\nCialdini, whom the King had requested to form a cabinet, did go and\r\nask him to keep quiet till there was some properly qualified person to\r\narrest him; but this, not unnaturally, he declined to do. He left\r\nFlorence by special train for Terni, whence he crossed the frontier\r\nand joined the insurgent bands near Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom the 19th to the 26th, Napoleon again and again ordered and\r\ncountermanded the departure of the transports from Toulon. On the last\r\ndate the final order was given and the ships started. The news must\r\nhave just reached Paris that the King had called upon General Menabrea\r\nto undertake the task which had been abandoned by Cialdini, whose name\r\nrecalled Castelfidardo too strongly to have a sound welcome either in\r\nthe Vatican or at St Cloud. When Napoleon heard that Menabrea was to\r\nbe Rattazzi's successor, he knew that there was no fear that the new\r\nGovernment, carried away by the popular current which was manifestly\r\nhaving its effect on the King, should, after all, order the Italian\r\narmy to the front. Menabrea, the Savoyard who in 1860 chose the\r\nItalian nationality which his son has lately cast away, was the old\r\nopponent of Cavour in the Turinese chamber, and of all Italian\r\npoliticians he was the most lukewarm on the Roman question. All chance\r\nof a collision between the French and Italian armies was removed.\r\nMenabrea did occupy some positions over the Papal frontier, it would\r\nbe hard to say with what intention, unless it were to appear to fulfil\r\na sort of promise given by the King during the ministerial\r\ninterregnum. The troops were ordered on no account to attack the\r\nFrench, and as soon as the Garibaldian campaign was at an end, they\r\nwere brought home. It was not worth while to send them with their\r\nhands tied to almost within earshot of where other Italians were\r\nfighting and falling. Menabrea's attitude towards the volunteers was\r\nimmediately revealed by the issue of a royal proclamation, in which\r\nthey were declared rebels. The French were free to act.\r\n\r\nAll this time the revolution in Rome, which it was admitted on all\r\nsides would have gone far towards cutting the knot, did not begin.\r\nBesides the cause already assigned, the absence of the heads, there was\r\nanother, the almost total lack of arms. To remedy this, Enrico and\r\nGiovanni Cairoli, with some seventy followers, tried to take a supply of\r\narms up the Tiber to Rome. Only the immense importance of the object\r\ncould have justified so desperate an attempt. Obliged to abandon their\r\nboats near Ponte Molle, they struck off into the Monti Parioli, where\r\nthey were attacked, within sight of the promised land, at a spot called\r\nVilla Gloria. Their assailants were three times their number, and those\r\nwho were not killed were carried prisoners to Rome. Among the killed was\r\nthe captain of the band, who fell in the arms of his young brother. As\r\nEnrico Cairoli lay dying, the French Zouaves (was this the chivalry of\r\nFrance?) charged the two brothers with their bayonets, piercing Giovanni\r\nwith ten wounds, from injuries arising from one of which he expired a\r\nyear later, after long torments. 'Dastardly French!' cried Enrico with\r\nhis last breath. They were the third and fourth sons of Adelaide Cairoli\r\nwho died for their country. One only of her five children remained to\r\nstand by her own death-bed--Benedetto, the future Prime Minister, and\r\nsaviour of King Humbert from the knife of an assassin.\r\n\r\nThe Papal army was composed of 13,000 men, General de Courten\r\ncommanding the portion of it which could be spared out of Rome. The\r\nBreton, Colonel Charette, had charge of the Zouaves. Since the French\r\ngarrison left, much trouble had been taken to make this force\r\nefficient. Under Garibaldi's own orders there were between 7000 and\r\n8000 volunteers. Those who have made a higher estimate have included\r\nother bands which, either from the difficulty of provisioning a larger\r\nnumber, or from want of time for concentration, remained at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe chief's arrival soon infused new life into the camp. On the 24th\r\nhe moved towards Monte Rotondo, one of the castellated heights near\r\nRome, which commands the Nomentane and Tiburtine ways to the south,\r\nand the railway and Via Salara to the west. It was generally\r\nconsidered the most important military position in the Papal states.\r\nThe garrison was small, but, perched as they were on a hill crest\r\nwhich looks inaccessible, the defenders might well hope to hold out\r\ntill help came from Rome. They had artillery, of which the volunteers\r\nhad none, and the old castle of the Orsini, where they made their\r\nprincipal stand, was well adapted for defence. From the morning of the\r\n25th till midnight, the Garibaldians hurled themselves against the\r\nwalls of the rock town without making much way; but at last the\r\nresistance grew weak, and when the morning light came, the white flag\r\nwas seen flying. At four in the afternoon of the 26th a Papal column\r\ntardily arrived upon the scene, but they perceived that all was over\r\nat Monte Rotondo, and, after firing a few musket shots, they fled to\r\nRome in disorder.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi rode into the cathedral, where he fixed his quarters for the\r\nnight. In Italy churches have ever been applied to such uses. After\r\nthe reduction of Milan, Francesco Sforza rode into the Duomo, and when\r\nKing Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome, he rode into the basilica of\r\nSt John Lateran. The guerilla chief bivouacked in a confessional,\r\nwhile his Red-shirts slept where they could on the cathedral floor.\r\nFour hundred of them had been killed or wounded in the assault.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners of war were brought before Garibaldi, who praised their\r\nvalour and sent them under an escort to the Italian frontier. Two or\r\nthree were retained for the following reason. Garibaldi had heard of\r\nthe Cairolis' heroic failure, and after his victory his first thought\r\nwas of them and of their sorrowing mother. He asked Signora Mario if\r\nthere were any notabilities among the Papal prisoners. She mentioned\r\nCaptain Quatrebras and others, and he sent her into Rome on a mission\r\nto the Papal commander with a view to exchanging these prisoners for\r\nthe wounded Giovanni and for his brother's body. The proposal was\r\naccepted, and the compact kept after Mentana had changed the aspect of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n'Garibaldi at the gates!' was the news that spread like wildfire\r\nthrough Rome on the evening of the 26th of October. Terror, real\r\nterror, and no less real joy filled all hearts; but the sides were\r\nsoon to be reversed. Another piece of news was not long in coming:\r\n'The French at Civita Vecchia!'\r\n\r\nThe French arrived on the 29th, and on the same day Garibaldi advanced\r\nalmost to the walls of Rome, still hoping for a revolutionary movement\r\nto break out within the city; but the information which he then\r\nreceived deprived him finally of this hope, and he gave the order to\r\nreturn to Monte Rotondo. Volunteers have the defect of being soldiers\r\nwho _think_; on this occasion they thought that the backward march was\r\nthe beginning of the end--that, in short, the game was up. A third of\r\nthe whole number deserted, and took the road towards the Italian\r\nfrontier. Garibaldi himself seems to have had a first idea of crossing\r\ninto the Abruzzi, and there waiting to see what turn events would\r\ntake; but he did not long entertain it, and, when he again left Monte\r\nRotondo, it was with the fixed design of fighting a battle. He\r\nexpected, however, to fight the Papal troops alone, and not the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nThis was very nearly being the case. On the 1st of November, the Papal\r\nGeneral Kanzler called on General De Failly at Civita Vecchia, and\r\nfound him, to his concern, by no means anxious to rush into the fray.\r\nEven when sending the troops, Napoleon seems to have hoped to escape\r\nfrom being seriously compromised. He probably thought that the moral\r\neffect of their landing would cause Garibaldi to retire, and that thus\r\nthe whole affair would collapse. But the Papal authorities did not\r\nwant it to collapse; they wanted more bloodshed, and if the words\r\nwhich express the ungarnished truth as acknowledged by their own\r\nwriters and apologists, sound indecent when describing the government\r\nof the Vicar of Christ, it only shows once more the irreconcilability\r\nof the offices of priest and king in the nineteenth century. Kanzler\r\ninsisted that a crushing blow must be inflicted on the volunteers\r\nbefore they had time to retreat. He argued so long and so well that De\r\nFailly promised him a brigade under General Polhès to aid in the\r\nattack which he proposed to make on Monte Rotondo.\r\n\r\nThe Papal forces left Rome by Porta Pia, and took the Via Nomentana,\r\nwhich leads to Monte Rotondo by Mentana. They were on the march at\r\nfour o'clock a.m. Garibaldi had ordered his men to be ready at dawn on\r\nthe same day (it was the 3rd of November); but Menotti suggested that,\r\nbefore they started, there should be a distribution of shoes, a\r\nconsignment of which had just reached the camp. Many of the volunteers\r\nwere barefoot, which gives a notion of their general equipment.\r\nGaribaldi, who rarely took advice, yielded to his son. Had he not done\r\nso, before the Papal army reached Mentana, he would have been at\r\nTivoli. One delay brings another, and it was midday when the march\r\nbegan. Garibaldi looked sad, and spoke to no one, but hummed some bars\r\nof Riego's hymn, the Spanish song of freedom, full of a wild, sweet\r\npathos, to which his tanned-faced legionaries had marched under the\r\nMonte Videan sun. Could he but have had with him those strong warriors\r\nnow! He mounted his horse, put it to a gallop, which he rarely did,\r\nand, riding down the ranks of the column, took his place at its head.\r\nWhen he arrived at the village of Mentana, he heard that the\r\nPontificals were close by, and he waited to give them battle.\r\n\r\nMentana lies in a depression commanded by the neighbouring mounds,\r\nnot a good configuration for defence. This village in the Roman\r\nCampagna sprang into history on a November day one thousand and\r\nsixty-seven years before, as the meeting-place of Charlemagne and Leo\r\nIII. Here they shook hands over their bargain: that the Pope should\r\ncrown the great Charles Emperor, and that the Emperor should assure to\r\nthe Pope his temporal power. And now the ragged band of Italian youths\r\nwas come to say that of bargains between Popes and Emperors there had\r\nbeen enough.\r\n\r\nThey numbered less than 5000. General De Failly reckoned the Papal\r\ntroops engaged at 3000 and the French at 2000, but Italian authorities\r\ncompute the former at a higher figure. The most experienced of the\r\nGaribaldian officers thought that the attackers were twice as numerous\r\nas they were. At the first onslaught great confusion prevailed among\r\nthe volunteers. Mentana seemed lost, but the sound of the guns they\r\nhad captured at Monte Rotondo restored their _moral_, and making a\r\ngallant rush forward they retook the principal positions with the\r\nbayonet. As they saw the Pontificals swerve back they uttered cries of\r\njoy. It was two o'clock. The enemy's fire slackened; something was\r\ngoing on which the volunteers could not make out. All at once there\r\nwas a sharp unfamiliar detonation, resembling the whirring sound of a\r\nmachine. The French had come into action.\r\n\r\nA hailstorm of bullets mowed down the Garibaldian ranks. Their two\r\nguns were useless, for the ammunition, seventy rounds in all, was\r\nexhausted. They fought till four o'clock--till nearly their last\r\ncartridge was gone; then they slowly retreated. Very few of them\r\nguessed what that peculiar sound meant, or imagined that they had been\r\nengaged with the French, but next morning Europe knew from General De\r\nFailly's report that 'the Chassepots had done wonders.'\r\n\r\nGaribaldi left the field, haggard and aged, unable to reconcile\r\nhimself to a defeat which he thought that more discipline, more\r\nsteadiness in his rank and file, would have turned into a victory. He\r\nhad always demanded the impossible of his men; till now they had given\r\nit to him. In time he judged more justly. Those miserably-armed lads\r\nwho lately had been glad to eat the herbs of the field, if haply they\r\nfound any, stood out for four hours against the pick of two regular\r\narmies, one of which was supposed to be the finest in the world. They\r\nhad done well.\r\n\r\nMentana remained that night in the hands of 1500 Garibaldians, who\r\nstill occupied the castle and most of the houses when the general\r\nretreat was ordered. In the morning the Garibaldian officer who held\r\nthe castle capitulated, on condition that the volunteers 'shut up in\r\nMentana' should be reconducted across the frontier; terms which the\r\nFrench and Papal generals interpreted to embrace only the defenders of\r\nthe castle. Eight hundred of the others were taken in triumph to Rome.\r\nIt would have been wiser to let them go. The Romans had been told that\r\nthe Garibaldians were cut-throats, incendiaries, human bloodhounds\r\nwaiting to fly at them. What did they behold? 'The beast is gentle,'\r\nas Euripides makes his captors say of Dionysius. The stalwart Romans\r\nsaw a host of boys, with pale, wistful, very young-looking faces. If\r\nanything was wanting to seal the fate of the Temporal Power it was the\r\nsight of that procession of famished and wounded Italians brought to\r\nRome by the foreigner.\r\n\r\nThe victors, however, were jubilant. Their inharmonious shouts of\r\n_Vive Pie Neuf_ vexed the delicate Roman ears. It was the battle-cry\r\nof the day of Mentana. Begun by the masked, finished by the unmasked\r\nsoldiers of France, Mentana was a French victory, and it was the last.\r\n\r\nThe Garibaldian retreat continued through the night to Passo Corese on\r\nthe Italian frontier. The silence of the Campagna was only broken by\r\nlittle gusts of a chilly wind off the Tiber; it seemed as if a\r\nspectral army moved without sound. Garibaldi rode with his hat pressed\r\ndown over his eyes; only once he spoke: 'It is the first time they\r\nmake me turn my back like this,' he said to an old comrade, 'it would\r\nhave been better ...' He stopped, but it was easy to supply the words:\r\n'to die.'\r\n\r\nAs he was getting into the train at Figline, with the intention of\r\ngoing straight to Caprera, he was placed under arrest by order of the\r\nItalian Government. His officers had their hands on their swords, but\r\nhe forbade their using force. The arrest seemed an unnecessary slight\r\non the beaten man, who had loved Italy too well. But General Menabrea,\r\nwho ordered it, believes that he thereby saved Italian unity.\r\nAccording to an account given by him many years after to the\r\ncorrespondent of an English newspaper, Napoleon wrote at this juncture\r\nto King Victor Emmanuel, that as he was not strong enough to govern\r\nhis kingdom, he, Napoleon, was about to help him by relieving him of\r\nall parts of it except Piedmont, Lombardy and Venetia. The arrest of\r\nGaribaldi, by showing that the King 'could govern,' averted the\r\nimpending danger. In communicating it to Napoleon, the King is said to\r\nhave added 'that Italians would lose their last drop of blood before\r\nconsenting to disruption,' a warning which he was not unlikely to\r\ngive, but the whole story lacks verisimilitude. It appears more\r\ncredible that an old man's memory is at fault than that a letter, so\r\ncolossally insolent, was actually written. Menabrea, and even the\r\nKing, may have feared that something of the kind was in the mind of\r\nthe Emperor.\r\n\r\nAs after Aspromonte so after Mentana; Garibaldi was confined in the\r\nfortress of Varignano, on the bay of Spezia. A few weeks later he was\r\nreleased and sent to Caprera. As he left the fortress-prison he wrote\r\nthe words: 'Farewell, Rome; farewell, Capitol; who knows who will\r\nthink of thee, and when?'\r\n\r\nThe last crusade was over; destiny would do the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nROME, THE CAPITAL\r\n\r\n1867-1870\r\n\r\nM. Rouher's 'Never'--Papal Infallibility--Sédan--The Breach in Porta\r\nPia--The King of Italy in Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nMentana had its epilogue in the debate in the French Corps Législatif,\r\nwhich lasted from the 2nd to the 5th of December. Jules Favre proposed\r\na vote of censure on the Ministry for their Roman policy. The most\r\ndistinguished speaker who followed him was Thiers, who said that\r\nthough in opposition, he would support the Government tooth and nail\r\nin their defence of French interests at Rome. The debate was wound up\r\nby the memorable declaration of the Prime Minister, Rouher, that\r\n'never' should Italy get possession of Rome. 'Is that clear?' he\r\nasked. It was quite clear. The word escaped him, he afterwards said,\r\nin 'the heat of improvisation.' The French Chamber confirmed it by\r\nthrowing out Favre's motion by 237 votes against 17.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, the Ultramontanes were jubilant throughout the world.\r\nNapoleon was compromised, enmeshed beyond extrication.\r\n\r\nOf all these events, Prussia, or rather the great man who was the\r\nbrain of Prussia, took attentive note. He was convinced that the\r\nwonders accomplished by the Chassepot at Mentana would soon lead\r\nFrance to try the effect of the new rifle on larger game. Among the\r\nmeasures which he took with a view to that contingency, his\r\ncorrespondence with Mazzini is not the least remarkable. It began in\r\nNovember 1867, and was continued for a year. The object of both\r\nBismarck and Mazzini was to prevent Italy from taking sides with\r\nFrance. The negotiations were carried on partly through Count\r\nd'Usedom, Prussian Minister at Florence, and partly through other\r\nintermediaries. Mazzini began by saying, that although the\r\nChancellor's methods of unification had not his sympathy, he admired\r\nhis energy, tenacity and independence; that he believed in German\r\nunity and opposed the supremacy which France arrogated to herself in\r\nEurope. He engaged to use his influence in Italy to make it difficult\r\nfor an Italian Government to take up arms for the victors of Mentana.\r\nBismarck was well aware that in speaking of his influence the writer\r\nused no idle phrase, but possibly one of his reasons for continuing\r\nthe correspondence was to find out what Mazzini knew of the hidden\r\nplots and counter plots then in manufacture both in Paris and at\r\nFlorence, because the Italian was more conversant with diplomatic\r\nsecrets than any man living, except, perhaps, Cardinal Antonelli. In\r\nApril 1868, Mazzini received through the Prussian Embassy at Florence,\r\na document which even now possesses real interest on the relative\r\nadvantages to Italy of a French or German Alliance. The whole question\r\nturned, observed the Prussian Chancellor, on the mastery of the\r\nMediterranean: here France and Italy must find themselves at variance\r\nwhether they willed it or not. 'The configuration of the terrestrial\r\nglobe not being amenable to change, they will be always rivals and\r\noften enemies.' Nature has thrown between them an apple of discord,\r\nthe possession of which they will not cease to contest. The\r\nMediterranean ought to become an Italian lake. 'It is impossible for\r\nItaly to put up with the perpetual threats of France to obtain the\r\nmastery over Tunis, which would be for her the first stage to arriving\r\nin Sardinia.'\r\n\r\nAt the Berlin Congress eight years later, Prince Bismarck pressed the\r\nsame views upon Count Corti, the Italian delegate. He would have been\r\nglad to see the Italians go to Tunis, but Count Corti ingenuously\r\nreplied: 'You want to make us quarrel with France.' Meanwhile the\r\nEnglishman who represented France and the Englishman who represented\r\nEngland were discussing the same subject, and out of their discussion\r\narose the French occupation of Tunis. Disquieting rumours got about at\r\nonce, but they were dispelled. 'No French Government would be so\r\nrash,' said Gambetta, 'as to make Italy the _irreconcilable_ foe of\r\nFrance.' M. Waddington declared that he was personally opposed to the\r\nacquisition of Tunis, and gave his word of honour that nothing would\r\nbe done without the full consent of Italy. What was done and how it\r\nwas done is known to all. And so it happens that a great French naval\r\nstation is in course of construction almost within sight of Sicily\r\n_and of Malta._\r\n\r\nIn the document communicated by Bismarck to Mazzini, there is a\r\ncurious inclusion of Trieste among Italian seaports which seems to\r\nindicate that he was still not averse from a rectification of the\r\nItalian north-east frontier. Whence it may be supposed that he\r\nexpected to find Austria ranged on the part of France in the struggle\r\nfor the Rhine bank. To explain how it was that this did not happen, we\r\nmust leave the Chancellor and the Revolutionist, and see what at the\r\nsame time was going on between Napoleon on the one side and Austria\r\nand Italy on the other.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor was not so infatuated as to court the risk of\r\nmaking war on Prussia single-handed if he could avoid it. He hoped for\r\na triple alliance of France, Austria and Italy, or, if that could not\r\nbe compassed, a dual alliance of France with either of these Powers.\r\nNow, wisely or unwisely, both the Italian and Austrian Governments\r\nwere far from rejecting these proposals off-hand. The secret\r\nnegotiations lasted from 1868 till June 1869. They took the shape of\r\ninformal letters between the King of Italy and Napoleon, and of\r\nprivate communications with Count Beust through Prince Metternich, the\r\nAustrian Ambassador in Paris, who was the intimate friend and\r\nconfidant of the Emperor and Empress. General Menabrea was not let\r\ninto the secret till later. With regard to Victor Emmanuel, there is\r\nno doubt that he wished with all his heart to be able to do a good\r\nturn to his Imperial ally of 1859 if the occasion presented itself.\r\nSome men see their wives even to old age as they saw them when they\r\nwere young and fair. The first print on the retina of the mental\r\nvision was so strong that no later impression can change or efface it.\r\nThis hallucination is not confined to the marital relationship, and\r\nVictor Emmanuel never left off seeing Napoleon in one sole light: as\r\nthe friend of Solferino. It may be that he perceived what the Italians\r\ndid not perceive: that the obligation was owed to Napoleon alone,\r\nwhile all France had a part in the subsequent injuries. At any rate\r\nthe idea of refusing the Emperor's appeal was repugnant in the extreme\r\nto the Italian King, who personally would have strained any point\r\nrather than give that refusal.\r\n\r\nThe King, however, and General Menabrea, who was finally admitted into\r\nthe conspiracy, could not be blind to the fact that an unpopular war\r\nmight create so great an agitation in the country that the dynasty\r\nitself would be in danger. A war for France while the French were in\r\nRome would have raised one storm of indignation from Palermo to Turin.\r\nSo their ultimatum was this: Rome capital of Italy, or no alliance.\r\n\r\nThere remained Austria, but if Napoleon ever hoped to conclude a\r\nseparate treaty with her, he was to discover his mistake. From the\r\nmoment that Austria resigned the Iron Crown, the symbol of her Italian\r\npower, she acted towards Italy with a loyalty that has few parallels\r\nin history. And she, too, replied to Napoleon: Rome capital of Italy,\r\nor no alliance.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican has never forgiven this to Austria. At the present hour,\r\nwhile republican France with her open antagonism to all religion, is\r\nthe favoured daughter of the Church, Austria, the only country in\r\nEurope except Spain where the Roman Catholic cultus retains all its\r\noriginal pomp and almost all its mediæval privileges, meets from the\r\nVatican a studied plan of opposition, the object of which can only be\r\nto bring her Government to a deadlock. From France the Pope still\r\nhopes for aid in the recovery of his temporalities; from Austria he\r\nknows that he will never receive it. So much have politics and so\r\nlittle has religion to do now, as in all ages, with the motives that\r\ngovern the Holy See.\r\n\r\n  Ahi, Costantin, di quanto mal fu matre\r\n    Non la tua conversion, ma quella dote\r\n  Che da te prese il primo ricco patre!\r\n\r\nThe years 1868 and 1869 passed uneventfully for Italy. In the former\r\nyear Prince Humbert married his cousin Margherita of Savoy. He was\r\npreviously engaged to the Archduchess Matilda, the only daughter of\r\nthe Victor of Custoza, but the young Princess met with a terrible\r\ndeath just when the betrothal was about to be announced. No one\r\nworthier to receive from Adelaide of Burgundy the lovely title of\r\nQueen of Italy could have been found than the Princess Margaret, who\r\ninherited the sunny charm which had endeared her father, the Duke of\r\nGenoa, to all who knew him.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1869 another domestic event, the severe illness of\r\nVictor Emmanuel, gave rise to an incident which made a deep impression\r\nin Italy, and attached the nation by one link more to the King of its\r\nchoice. The illness which seized Victor Emmanuel at his hunting-box\r\nof San Rossore, in a malarious part of Tuscany, proved so serious\r\nthat his life was despaired of. A priest was called to hear the King's\r\nlast confession, and to administer the Sacraments for the dying. After\r\nhearing the confession, the priest said he could not give absolution\r\nunless Victor Emmanuel signed a solemn retractation of all the acts\r\nperformed during his reign that were contrary to the interests of the\r\nChurch. The King answered, without a moment's hesitation, that he died\r\na Christian and a Catholic, and that if he had wronged anyone he\r\nsincerely repented and asked pardon of God, but the signature demanded\r\nwas a political act, and if the priest wished to talk politics his\r\nministers were in the next room. Thither the ecclesiastic retired, but\r\nhe very soon returned, and administered the rite without more ado.\r\nWhat had passed was this: General Menabrea, with a decision for which\r\nhe cannot be too much praised, threatened the priest with instant\r\narrest unless he surrendered his pretensions. Only those who know the\r\nextraordinary terror inspired in an Italian Catholic by the prospect\r\nof dying unshriven can appreciate the merit of the King, whose faith\r\nwas childlike, in standing as firm in the presence of supernatural\r\narms as he stood before the Austrian guns.\r\n\r\nMenabrea's administration was then upon the eve of falling. The cause\r\nwas one of those financial crises that were symptomatic of a mischief\r\nwhich has been growing from then till now, when some critics think\r\nthey see in it the fatal upas tree of Italy. The process of\r\ntransforming a country where everything was wanting--roads, railways,\r\nlines of navigation, schools, water, lighting, sanitary provisions,\r\nand the other hundred thousand requirements of modern life--into the\r\nItaly of to-day, where all these things have made leaps almost\r\nincredible to those who knew her in her former state, has proved\r\ncostly without example. During the whole period it has been necessary\r\nto spend in ever-increasing ratio on the army and navy, and this\r\nexpenditure, though emphatically not the chief, has yet been a\r\nconcomitant cause of financial trouble. The point cannot be inquired\r\ninto here of how far greater wisdom and higher character in Italian\r\npublic servants might have limited the evil and reconciled progress\r\nwith economy; but it may be said that if the path entered upon by the\r\nman who took charge of the exchequer after Menabrea's fall, Quintino\r\nSella, had been rigorously followed by his successors, the present\r\nsituation would not be what it is.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Lanza assumed the premiership in the government in which\r\nSella was Minister of Finance. Both these politicians were\r\nPiedmontese, and both were known as men of conspicuous integrity, but\r\nLanza's rigid conservatism made it seem unlikely that the Roman\r\nquestion would take a fresh turn under his administration. In\r\npolitics, however, the unlikely is what generally happens; events are\r\nstronger than men.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December the twenty-first Ecumenical Council assembled\r\nin Rome. From the day of its meeting, in spite of the strenuous\r\nopposition of its most learned and illustrious members, there was no\r\nmore doubt that the dogma under consideration would be voted by the\r\npartly astute and partly complaisant majority than that it would have\r\nbeen rejected in the twenty preceding Councils. On the 18th of July\r\n1870, the Pope was proclaimed Infallible.\r\n\r\nThat was a moment of excitement such as has not often thrilled Europe,\r\nbut the cause was not the Infallibility of Pius IX. On the 16th,\r\nNapoleon declared war with Prussia. War, like death, comes as a shock,\r\nhowever plainly it has been foreseen; besides, it was only the\r\nwell-informed who knew how near the match had been to the\r\npowder-magazine for two years and more. Whether the explosion, at the\r\nlast, was timed by Napoleon or by Bismarck is not of great importance;\r\nit could have been but little delayed. Napoleon was beset alike by the\r\nrevolutionary spectre and by the gaunt King of Terrors; he knew the\r\nthrow was desperate, but with the gambler's instinct, which had always\r\nbeen so strong in him, he was magnetised by it because it was\r\ndesperate. Pitiful egotist though he was, history may forgive him\r\nsooner than it forgives the selfish Chauvinism of Thiers, who had been\r\ngoading his countrymen to war ever since Sadowa, or the insane bigotry\r\nof the party which, having triumphed over revolution at Mentana, now\r\nsought to triumph over heresy in what the Empress called 'Ma guerre.'\r\n\r\nNapoleon had the remaining sagacity to see the extreme danger of\r\nleaving a few thousand men isolated in Rome at a time when, happen\r\nwhat might, it would be impossible to reinforce them. Directly after\r\ndeclaring war, notwithstanding the cries of the Ultramontanes, he\r\ndecided on recalling the French troops. He induced the Italian\r\nGovernment to resume the obligations of the September Convention, by\r\nwhich the inviolability of the Papal frontier was guaranteed. Lanza is\r\nopen to grave criticism for entering into a contract which it was\r\nmorally certain that he would not be able to keep. Perhaps he hoped\r\nthat Napoleon would himself release Italy from her bond. But the\r\n'Jamais' of Rouher stood in the way. Could the Emperor, after such\r\nboasting, coolly throw the Pope overboard the first time it suited his\r\nconvenience? Moreover, his present Prime Minister, M. Emile Olivier,\r\nwhen the question was put to him, did not hesitate to renew the\r\ndeclaration that the Italians must not be allowed to go to Rome.\r\n\r\nNapoleon made some last frantic efforts to get Austria and Italy to\r\nbefriend him unconditionally. How far he knew the real state of his\r\narmy before he declared war may be doubtful, but that he possessed\r\noverwhelming proof of it, even before the first defeats, cannot be\r\ndoubted at all. His heart was not so light as his Prime Minister's. At\r\nthe end of July he sent General Türr on a secret mission to try and\r\nobtain the help of Austria and Italy. The Hungarian general wrote from\r\nFlorence, that unless something could be done to assure Italy that the\r\nnational question would be settled in accordance with the wishes of\r\nher people, the Italian alliance was not possible. The Convention, he\r\npointed out, was a bane instead of a boon to Italy. This letter was\r\nanswered by a telegram through the French Ambassador at Vienna: 'Can't\r\ndo anything for Rome; if Italy will not march, let her stand still.\r\n\r\nAs in the former negotiations, Austria took her stand on precisely the\r\nsame ground as Italy. And thus it was that France plunged into the\r\ncampaign of 1870 single-handed.\r\n\r\nAfter Wörth, and once more after Gravelotte, the endeavour to draw\r\nItaly into the struggle was renewed. Napoleon was aware that Victor\r\nEmmanuel was wildly anxious to come to the rescue, and on this\r\npersonal goodwill his last hope was built. Prince Napoleon was\r\ndespatched from the camp at Châlons to see what he could do. At this\r\neleventh hour (19th August) Napoleon was ready to yield about Rome. At\r\nthe camp, the influence which guided him in Paris was less felt, or it\r\nis probable that he would not have yielded even now. Prince Napoleon\r\ncarried a sheet of white paper with the Emperor's signature at the\r\nfoot. He showed it to Lanza when he reached Florence, and told him to\r\nfill it up as he chose. Whatever he asked for was already granted. A\r\nmonth before, such terms would have won both Italy and Austria--not\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe Prince found his father-in-law eager to give the 50,000 men that\r\nwere asked for, but the ministers protested that the Italian army was\r\nunprepared for war. Still, to satisfy the King, who signified his\r\nirritation so clearly to Lanza that this good servant was on the point\r\nof resigning, they agreed to submit the case to Austria; if Austria\r\nwould co-operate, they would re-consider their decision. Austria\r\nreplied: 'Too late.'\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1873, Victor Emmanuel paid a visit to Berlin, he caused some\r\nsensation at a grand State banquet by saying to his host: 'But for\r\nthese gentlemen' (and he waved his hand towards the ministers who\r\naccompanied him) 'I should have gone to war with you.' Courtiers did\r\nnot know which way to look, but the aged Emperor was not displeased by\r\nthe soldierly bluntness of the avowal.\r\n\r\nPrince Napoleon remained in Florence, throwing away his eloquence,\r\ntill the 2nd of September cut short the argument. When he had left his\r\ncousin, the Emperor was resolved to fall back on Paris according to\r\nMacMahon's plan, but the ministers and the Empress Regent forced him\r\nto his doom. On the 2nd of September Sédan was lost; on the 4th the\r\nEmpire fell.\r\n\r\n'And to think,' exclaimed Victor Emmanuel when he heard the news,\r\n'that this good man was always wanting to give me advice!'\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the declaration of war, and still more since the\r\nevacuation of Rome by the French troops (begun on the 29th of July,\r\nended on the 19th of August), Italy had been too deeply agitated for\r\nany sane person to suppose that the prescriptive right of the nation\r\nto seize the opportunity which offered itself of completing its unity\r\ncould be resisted by the artificial dyke of a compromise which made\r\nthe Government the instrument of France. Lanza was determined to\r\nmaintain order; he had Mazzini arrested at Palermo, and suppressed\r\ndisorders where they occurred, but the rising tide of the will of the\r\npeople could not be suppressed, and had the ministry resisted it,\r\nsomething more than the ministry would have fallen.\r\n\r\nIn justification of Lanza's slowness to move, and of the apparent, if\r\nnot real, unwillingness with which he took every forward step, it is\r\ncontended that more precipitate action would have caused what most\r\npeople will agree would have been a misfortune for Italy, the\r\ndeparture of the Pope from Rome. It was only on the 20th of August\r\nthat the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Visconti-Venosta, sent a\r\nmemorandum to the European Powers which announced that the Government\r\nhad decided on occupying Rome at once. A week after, the fall of the\r\nEmpire came as a godsend to the ministry which had possibly hardly\r\ndeserved such a stroke of luck. They were no longer hampered by the\r\nSeptember Convention, because the September Convention was dead. This\r\nwas amply admitted by Jules Favre, though he declined to denounce the\r\ntreaty formally; even a French Radical, in the hour of setting up the\r\nRepublic, was afraid to proclaim aloud that France renounced all claim\r\nto interfere in her neighbour's concerns.\r\n\r\nOf the other Powers, Switzerland signified her approval, and the rest\r\nengaged to abstain from any opposition.\r\n\r\nThe King addressed a letter to the Pope, in which, with the affection\r\nof a son and the faith of a Catholic, he appealed to his spirit of\r\nbenevolence and his Italian patriotism to speak the word of peace in\r\nthe midst of the storm of war that was distracting Europe, and to\r\naccept the love and protection of the people of Italy in lieu of a\r\nsovereignty which could not stand without the support of foreign arms.\r\nPius IX. merely answered by saying that the letter was not worthy of\r\nan affectionate son, and that he prayed God to bestow upon His Majesty\r\nthe mercy of which he had much need. To the bearer of the royal\r\nappeal, Count Ponza di San Martino, he said that he might yield to\r\nviolence, but would never sanction injustice.\r\n\r\nThis was about the time that the Pope, on his side, wrote an appeal\r\nnot, be it observed, to any Catholic monarch, but to King William of\r\nPrussia, who would certainly not have read unmoved the complaint of\r\none who, like himself, was crowned with white hairs, but Count\r\nBismarck took the precaution of causing the letter not to reach his\r\nmaster's hands till the Italians were in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe day following the Pope's interview with Count Ponza, the 11th of\r\nSeptember, the Italian troops received the order to enter the Papal\r\nstates. For several weeks five divisions under General Cadorna had\r\nbeen in course of concentration along the frontier; this force now\r\nmarched on Rome. Bixio was sent to Civita Vecchia where resistance was\r\nexpected, and had been ordered by Kanzler, but the native element\r\nprevailed over the foreign in the garrison, and the Spanish\r\ncommandant, Colonel Serra, interpreting the wishes of the Roman\r\ntroops, surrendered without firing a shot.\r\n\r\nGreat was the indignation of the French and Belgian Zouaves. They were\r\nresolved that the same thing should not happen in Rome. That there was\r\na chance of avoiding bloodshed may be inferred, from Count Arnim's\r\nnumerous journeys between the Vatican and General Cadorna's\r\nheadquarters outside Porta Salara; the Prussian representative hoping\r\ntill the last moment to arrange matters in a pacific sense. Cardinal\r\nAntonelli is said to have been nearly persuaded, when he received a\r\nmessage from Colonel Charette in these terms: 'You had better go and\r\nsay mass while we look after defending you.' The war party so far\r\ncarried the day that the Pope adhered to his plan of 'sufficient\r\nresistance to show that he yielded only to force.'\r\n\r\nAt half-past five on the morning of the 20th of September, all\r\nattempts at conciliation having failed, the Italian attack was opened\r\nupon five different points, Porta San Pancrazio, Porta San Giovanni\r\nLaterano, Porta San Lorenzo, Porta del Popolo and Porta Pia. General\r\nMaze de la Roche's division attacked the latter gate, and the wall\r\nnear it, in which a breach was rapidly effected by the steady fire of\r\nthe Italian batteries, though it was not till past eight o'clock that\r\nit seemed large enough to admit of an assault. Then the 41st of the\r\nline, and the 12th and 34th Bersaglieri were ordered up, and dashed\r\ninto the breach with the cry of 'Savoia! Savoia!' The challenge was\r\nreturned by the Zouaves with their 'Vive Pie Neuf.' They had been\r\nalready ordered to desist, as the Pope's instructions were clear, 'to\r\nstop when a breach was made;' but on the plea that the order was sent\r\nto them verbally they continued firing. When the written order came,\r\nthey displayed a white handkerchief fastened to a bayonet, and at this\r\npoint the fight was over. Hundreds of Roman exiles poured through the\r\nbreach after the soldiers; 15,000 of them had arrived or were arriving\r\nat the gates of the city.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the white flag was hoisted on Porta Pia, but on the\r\nadvance of the 40th Regiment and a battalion of Bersaglieri, shots\r\nwere fired which killed and wounded several officers and men; when\r\nthey saw their companions falling, the troops could not be restrained\r\nfrom scaling the barricade which had been formed to defend the gate,\r\nand surrounding and capturing the Zouaves who were behind it. The\r\nwhole Diplomatic Corps now came out in full uniform to urge General\r\nCadorna to effect the occupation as quickly as possible, that order\r\nmight be maintained. By midday, the Italian troops had penetrated into\r\nmost parts of the city left of the Tiber; as yet there was no formal\r\ncapitulation on the part of the Zouaves, and their attitude was not\r\nexactly reassuring. This did not prevent the population, both men and\r\nwomen, from filling the streets and greeting the Italians with every\r\nsign of rejoicing. They cheered, they wept, they kissed the national\r\nflag, and the cry of _Roma Capitale_ drowned all other cries, even as\r\nthe fact it saluted closed the discords and the factions of ages.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon all the Papal troops were persuaded to lay down their\r\narms, which, in the case of the foreigners, were given back to them.\r\nNext day they were reviewed by General Cadorna. As the Italians\r\npresented arms to the retiring host, some of the Antibes Legion\r\nshouted at them: 'We are French, we shall meet you again.' The Roman\r\ntroops were sent to their homes; the foreigners conducted to the\r\nfrontier, Charette and other of the French officers went to the\r\nbattlefields of their prostrate country, and thus it came to pass that\r\nthe Pope's defenders were found fighting side by side with Garibaldi;\r\nthey, indeed, only doing their simple duty, but he, acting on an\r\nimpulse of Quixotic generosity which was repaid--the world knows how!\r\n\r\nCadorna received three pressing requests from the Pope to occupy the\r\nLeonine City, and the third he granted. The idea of leaving the part\r\nof Rome on which the Vatican stands under the Pope's jurisdiction had\r\nbeen long favoured by a certain class of politicians, and Lanza made\r\na last effort to give it effect by excluding the Leonine City from the\r\nplebiscite which was ordered to take place in Rome and in the Roman\r\nprovince on the 2nd of October. It was in vain. The first voting urn\r\nto arrive at the Capitol on the appointed day was a glass receptacle\r\nborne by a huge Trasteverino, and preceded by a banner inscribed:\r\n'Città Leonina Si.' As the Government had not supplied the inhabitants\r\nwith an official urn, it occurred to them to provide themselves with\r\nan unofficial one in which they duly deposited their votes. The Roman\r\nplebiscite yielded the results of 133,681 affirmative and 1507\r\nnegative votes.\r\n\r\nIn December the Italian Parliament met for the last time in the Hall\r\nof the Five Hundred. 'Italy,' said the King in the speech from the\r\nthrone, 'is free and united; it depends on us to make her great and\r\nhappy.' Of this last session at Florence the principal labour was the\r\nAct embodying the Papal guarantees which was intended to safeguard the\r\nlegitimate independence and decorum of the Holy See on the lines\r\nformerly advocated by Cavour. Neither extreme party was satisfied, but\r\nit seemed at first not unlikely that the Pope would tacitly acquiesce\r\nin the arrangement. The first monthly payment of the national\r\ndotation, calculated to correspond with his civil list, was accepted.\r\nBut though the influence of Cardinal Antonelli and the Italian\r\nprelates had been sufficient to keep the Pope in Rome, the influence\r\nof those who wished him to leave it was strong enough to establish at\r\nthe Vatican the intransigent policy which has been pursued till now.\r\n\r\nDuring the flood of the Tiber which devastated the city that winter,\r\nthe King of Italy paid a first informal visit to his capital,\r\naccompanied only by a few attendants, and bent on bringing help to\r\nthe suffering population. In July 1872, he made his solemn entry, and\r\nat the same time the seat of Government was transferred to the Eternal\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVictor Emmanuel could say what few men have been able to say of so\r\nlarge a promise: 'I have kept my word.' He gathered up the Italian\r\nflag from the dust of Novara, and carried it to the Capitol. In spite\r\nof the grandeur of republican tradition in Italy, and the lofty\r\ncharacter of the men who represented it during the struggle for unity,\r\na study of these events leaves on the mind the conviction that, at\r\nleast in our time, the country could neither have been freed from the\r\nstranger nor welded into a single body-politic without a symbol which\r\nappealed to the imagination, and a centre of gravity which kept the\r\ndiverse elements together by giving the whole its proper balance. The\r\nLiberating Prince whom Machiavelli sought was found in the Savoyard\r\nKing. 'Quali porte se gli serrerebbono? Quali popoli gli negherebbono\r\nla obbedienza? Quale invidia se gli opporrebbe? Quale Italiano gli\r\nnegherebbe l'ossequio?' To fill the appointed part Victor Emmanuel\r\npossessed the supreme qualification, which was patriotism. Though he\r\ncame of an ambitious race, not even his enemies could with any\r\nseriousness bring to his charge personal ambition, since every step\r\nwhich took him further from the Alps, his fathers' cradle, involved a\r\nsacrifice of tastes and habits, and of most that made life congenial.\r\nWhen his work was finished, though he was not old, he had the\r\npresentiment that he should not long survive its completion. And so it\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of January 1878, the King was seized with one of\r\nthose attacks on the lungs which his vigorous constitution had\r\nhitherto enabled him to throw off. But in Rome this kind of illness is\r\nmore fatal than elsewhere, and the doctors were soon obliged to tell\r\nhim that there was no hope. 'Are we come to that?' he asked; and then\r\ndirected that the chaplain should be summoned. There was no repetition\r\nof the scene at San Rossore; the highest authority had already\r\nsanctioned the administration of the Sacraments to the dying King, nay,\r\nit is said that the Pope's first impulse was to be himself the bearer\r\nof them. At that hour the man got the better of the priest; Francis\r\ndrove out Dominic. The heart that had been made to pity and the lips\r\nthat had been formed to bless returned to their natural functions.\r\nWhen the aged Pius heard that all was over, exclaimed: 'He died like a\r\nChristian, a Sovereign and an honest man (galantuomo).' Very soon the\r\nPope followed the King to the grave, and so, almost together, these\r\ntwo historical figures disappear.\r\n\r\nSix years before, solitary and unsatisfied, Mazzini died at Pisa, his\r\nheart gnawed with the desire of the extreme, as the hearts have been\r\nof all those who aspired less to change what men do, or even what they\r\nbelieve, than what they are. More deep than political regrets was the\r\npain with which he watched the absorption of human energies, in the\r\nrace for wealth, for ease, for material happiness; he discerned that\r\nif the egotism of capital led to oppression, the egotism of labour\r\nwould lead to anarchy. To the end he preached the moral law of which\r\nhe had been the apostle through life. His last message to his\r\ncountrymen, written when the pen was falling from his hand, was a\r\nwarning to Italian workingmen to beware of the false gods of the new\r\nsocialism. When others saw darkness he saw light; now, Cassandra-like,\r\nhe saw darkness when others saw light; yet he did not doubt the\r\nultimate triumph of the light, but he no longer thought that his eyes\r\nwould see it, and he was glad to close them.\r\n\r\nLess sad, notwithstanding his physical martyrdom, were Garibaldi's\r\nlast years. Italy showed him an unforgetting love; when he came to the\r\ncontinent, the same multitudes waited for him as of old, but instead\r\nof cheers there was a not less impressive silence now, lest the\r\ninvalid should be disturbed. Soon after the transfer of the capital he\r\nwent to Rome to speak in favour of the works by which it was proposed\r\nto control the inundations of the Tiber, and it was curious to hear it\r\nsaid on all sides that, of course, the Tiber works must be taken in\r\nhand as Garibaldi wished it. Pius IX. summed up the situation wittily\r\nin the remark: 'Lately we were two here; now we are three.' The old\r\nhero invoked the day when bayonets might be turned into pruning-hooks,\r\nbut he by no means thought that it had arrived, and in the meanwhile\r\nhe urged the Italians to look to their defences, and above all, 'to be\r\nstrong on the sea, like England.' In the matter of government he\r\nremained the impenitent advocate of the rule of one honest man--call\r\nhim Dictator or what you please, so he be one! Garibaldi died at\r\nCaprera on the 2nd of June 1882. The play was ended, the actors\r\nvanished:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Dote kroton, kai pantes hymeis meta charas ktypêsate.]\r\n\r\nA new epoch has begun which need not detain the chronicler of Italian\r\nLiberation. The prose of possession succeeds the poetry of desire.\r\nNothing, however, can lessen the greatness of the achievement. With\r\nregard to the future, it may be allowable to recall the superstition\r\nwhich, like so many other seemingly meaningless beliefs, becomes full\r\nof meaning when read according to the spirit: that a house stands long\r\nif its foundations be watered with the blood of sacrifice.

Let Mazzini\r\nspeak for him from the grave: 'I do not know if I told you,' he wrote\r\nto the Marchesa Eleonora Curlo Ruffini, in a letter published a few\r\nmonths ago, 'that I have met upon my path, deserted enough, I hope,\r\nby choice, a Scotchman of mind and things, the first person here, up\r\ntill now, with whom I sympathise and who sympathises with me. We\r\ndiffer in nearly all opinions, but his are so sincere and\r\ndisinterested that I respect them. He is good, good, good; he has\r\nbeen, and I think he is still, unhappy in spite of the fame which\r\nsurrounds him; he has a wife with talent and feeling; always ailing;\r\nno children. They live out of town, and I go to see them every now and\r\nthen. They have no insular or other prejudices that jar upon me. I\r\nhave grown more intimate with this man in consequence, I think, of an\r\narticle I wrote here, after knowing him, against an historical work of\r\nhis; perhaps, accustomed as he is to common-place praise, to which he\r\nis indifferent, my frankness pleased him. For the rest I shall see him\r\nrarely, and I can only give him esteem and the warmest sympathy--not\r\nfriendship, which I can henceforth give to no one.' (22nd March\r\n1840.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: On the production of Verdi's opera, _I Lombardi alla\r\nprima Crociata_, the Austrian Archbishop of Milan wished the\r\nCommissary of Police to prohibit the performance because it treated of\r\nsacred subjects. When it was recognised as one of the accelerating\r\ncauses of the revolution, he drily remarked that they would have done\r\nbetter to take his advice. The grand chorus, 'O Signore dal tetto\r\nnatiò,' in which the censor had only seen a pious chant, became the\r\nmorning-song of national resurrection.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Long live who has money and who has none.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Of Garibaldi's foreign officers, Colonel (afterwards\r\nGeneral) Dunne was one of the most marked personalities. When quite a\r\nyoung man he sold his commission in the English army and took to\r\nfighting under many flags. In the Crimean War he commanded a company\r\nof Bashi Bazouks. He had in him more than a dash of Gordon, of Burton,\r\nand like them he could do what he chose with untamed natures. If he\r\nwas not obeyed fast enough he adopted rather strong measures. A\r\nSicilian company, under fire for the first time, failed to show\r\nsufficient promptitude in executing an order to escalade a wall and\r\njump into a garden, from which the enemy was keeping up a brisk fire.\r\nDunne caught up half-a-dozen of the men into his saddle and pitched\r\nthem bodily over the wall. The effect was singular, for seeing the\r\nGaribaldians falling from the clouds, the Neapolitans took to their\r\nheels, exclaiming: 'They can fly! they can fly!' Generally, however,\r\nhe infused his own courage into all who served under him with a touch,\r\nperhaps, of his own fatalistic mysticism. It was a strange experience\r\nto hear this courteous, mild-mannered gentleman lament that Rome had\r\nnot been burnt down; the disappearance of the scene of so many awful\r\ncrimes he regarded necessary as a moral sanitary measure.]",
