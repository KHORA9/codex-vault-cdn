It was carefully compiled from a mass of private\r\npapers and letters submitted to me by his brother, Sir Duncan Cameron,\r\nBart.; from several letters written to me by his brother officers; the\r\nMSS. Records of the 92nd Highlanders; and--like the sketch of Count\r\nO'Connell--from information readily afforded to me by the authorities\r\nat the War-Office and Horse Guards.\r\n\r\nIn several instances, the brief _Biographie Universelle_, edited by\r\nMichaud, has been of service to me in fixing dates--especially in the\r\naccount of the Lacys.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty Years' War, the Septennial War, and the War of the Spanish\r\nSuccession formed an ample field of enterprise for those Scots and\r\nIrish who, having nothing better to do at home, sold their swords and\r\ntheir valour to the highest bidder; and who, having but little hope\r\nof attaining rank in the service of Britain, sought fortune, fame,\r\nand a new home in the camp of the stranger. Thus many of the military\r\nwanderers who form the subject of these detached Memoirs belonged to\r\nthe Sister Isle.\r\n\r\nThe Irish troops in the service of France covered themselves with\r\nglory, as the Scots had done under Gustavus of Sweden; and by the\r\nMemoir of their last Colonel, Count O'Connell, it will be seen that\r\nthey were faithful and true, as they had been valiant, to the end. They\r\nfilled Europe with the fame of their exploits, and have left their\r\nbones on many a hard-fought battle-field; and, as their song has it,--\r\n\r\n \"They who survived fought and drank as of yore,\r\n But the land of their heart's hope they never saw more;\r\n For on far foreign fields, from Dunkirk to Belgrade,\r\n Lie the soldiers and chiefs of the IRISH BRIGADE!\"\r\n\r\nUnder the happier influences of the present time, our people are no\r\nlonger forced to seek their bread in foreign camps. The restless\r\nmilitary spirit which produced the Soldier of Fortune is now on the\r\nwane; yet it is impossible, without emotion, to look back on the\r\nexploits of those brave fellows who led the armies of Europe in so many\r\n\"king-making victories,\" and won by their swords those honours which\r\nwere denied them in the land of their forefathers.\r\n\r\n 26, _Danube Street_,\r\n Edinburgh, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              PAGE\r\n\r\n ARTHUR COUNT DE LALLY, General of the Troops of\r\n Louis XV. in India                                             1\r\n\r\n COLONEL JOHN CAMERON, of the Gordon Highlanders,\r\n slain at Quatre Bras                                          44\r\n\r\n ADMIRAL SIR SAMUEL GREIG, \"Father of the Russian\r\n Navy\"                                                         85\r\n\r\n ULYSSES COUNT BROWN, Marshal of the Armies of\r\n Maria Theresa                                                112\r\n\r\n MARSHAL LACY, the Conqueror of the Crimea                    142\r\n\r\n COUNT LACY, Marshal of the Imperial Armies                   164\r\n\r\n COUNT LACY, Captain General of Catalonia                     168\r\n\r\n LOUIS LACY, Mariscal de Campo and Commander of Leon          169\r\n\r\n COLONEL BUTLER, of the Irish Musketeers under the\r\n Emperor Ferdinand                                            178\r\n\r\n MARSHAL CLARKE, Duc de Feltre, and Governor of Vienna        192\r\n\r\n GENERAL KILMAINE, Commander of Lombardy, and the\r\n Armée d'Angleterre                                           213\r\n\r\n COUNTS O'REILLY, O'DONNEL, and the Irish in Spain            233\r\n\r\n BARON LOUDON, Marshal of the Austrian Army                   263\r\n\r\n COUNT O'REILLY, Chamberlain of the Empire                    292\r\n\r\n COUNT O'CONNELL, Knight of St. Louis, and Colonel of\r\n the Irish Brigade                                            298\r\n\r\n MARSHAL MACDONALD, Duke of Tarentum                          308\r\n\r\n THOMAS DALYELL, of Binns, General of the Scottish\r\n Army, and First Colonel of the Scots Grey Dragoons           356\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCAVALIERS OF FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE COUNT DE LALLY,\r\n\r\nGENERAL OF THE TROOPS OF LOUIS XV. IN THE EAST INDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many gallant Irishmen, and those descended from the Irish\r\nrace, who served in the armies of France, and sought there those\r\nhonours and distinctions which political misfortune and studied misrule\r\ndenied them at home, I know of none more distinguished, and of none\r\nwhose name is more worthy of being rescued from oblivion, than General\r\nthe Count de Lally, the ill-requited leader of the troops of Louis XV.\r\nin the wars of India.\r\n\r\nArthur Lally was the son of Captain O'Lally, of Tulloch na Daly, in\r\nGalway, who passed over to France soon after Limerick capitulated to\r\nGoderdt de Ginckel, the Dutch Earl of Athlone, and at the close of\r\nthat disastrous war in which the Irish troops withstood the army of\r\nKing William. Captain Lally obtained a commission in the regiment of\r\nthe Hon. Arthur Dillon, the same battalion in which the great Marshal\r\nMacdonald, Duke of Tarentum, commenced his military career as a\r\nsub-lieutenant.\r\n\r\nSoon after he settled in France, Captain Lally married a French lady\r\nof distinction. They had two children, the eldest of whom, Arthur, was\r\nsoon after his birth enrolled--according to a custom then prevailing\r\nin the French army--as a private soldier in the company of his\r\nfather. In this capacity he served at the famous siege of Barcelona\r\nunder the Maréchal Duke of Berwick in 1714. His father being an\r\nofficer of distinguished merit, and his mother being by blood allied\r\nto some of the most noble families in France, afforded young Daily\r\nevery opportunity for the improvement of his mind and person; thus at\r\nthe age of nineteen he was considered one of the handsomest and most\r\naccomplished chevaliers in Paris.\r\n\r\nWithout having seen much active service, he had then been appointed\r\nto a company in that gallant band of exiles whose valour contributed\r\nto win many a victory for the House of Bourbon--the _Irish Brigade_.\r\nHis regiment--every member of which knew his father's worth and\r\nmerit--received him with satisfaction, and his _reception_ took place\r\nearly in 1718.\r\n\r\nIn the old French service this was an indispensable ceremony when\r\nan officer first joined. His company was drawn up in front of the\r\nregiment, with the drummers beating on the flanks. Dressed in full\r\nuniform, with his scarf, sword, and gorget, Arthur Lally was led\r\nforward by the general of division, who, when the drums ceased, raised\r\nhis cocked hat, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"De par le Roi! Soldats, vous reconnoitrez Monsieur de Daily, votre\r\ncapitaine de la compagnie, et vous lui obeirez en tout ce qu'il vous\r\nordonnera pour le service du Roi, en cette qualité.\"\r\n\r\nAnother ruffle on the drums, the company fell back to its place in the\r\nline of the regiment of Dillon, and Arthur Dally was formally installed\r\nits captain.\r\n\r\nThough he was known by his education and spirit to have possessed all\r\nthose qualities which were requisite for the perfect soldier, uniting\r\na clear head and solid judgment to a light and joyous, but intrepid\r\nheart, he was found to be equally qualified for the civil service of\r\nthe State; thus at the age of five-and-twenty he was sent by Louis XV.\r\nto the court of Russia on a political mission of importance. On this\r\nduty he acquitted himself ably, his fidelity on one hand securing the\r\nconfidence of the king his master, by his address and winning manner;\r\non the other, obtaining the esteem and admiration of the Empress\r\nCatherine, whose husband, Peter the Great, had died about a year\r\nbefore. On his return to France in 1725 he proceeded to Versailles,\r\nwhere Louis XV., who had then attained his majority, and taken the\r\nreins of government from the Regent Duke of Orleans, received him in\r\nthe most gracious manner, and promoted him to the rank of colonel of\r\ninfantry; and at the head of his regiment he had the good fortune to\r\nacquit himself with distinction wherever he was employed.\r\n\r\nHe stood high in the favour of the two ministers who succeeded the\r\nDuke of Orleans, namely, the Duke de Bourbon and Cardinal Fleury,\r\nthen in his seventy-third year, a mild and amiable prelate, under\r\nwhose moderate and conciliatory counsels France enjoyed many years\r\nof peace and tranquillity. During service in France, Lally, though\r\nsomewhat proud and lofty in his manner, succeeded in gaining the\r\nesteem and affection of the officers of his regiment, among whom--even\r\nin those days of incessant duelling--he was fortunately successful\r\nin maintaining the most perfect union and harmony, while by his\r\nunalterable firmness subordination was equally maintained.\r\n\r\nThus had passed the time until 1745, when Prince Charles Edward Stuart\r\nprojected his gallant and unfortunate rising among the clans in the\r\nScottish Highlands. Entering warmly into the design of restoring the\r\nhapless House of Stuart, under which his father had served long and\r\nfaithfully, and with whom he had eaten the bread of exile, Colonel\r\nLally came boldly over to London. While his ostensible object was to\r\nrecover certain lands in Ireland, to which he averred his father had\r\na claim, his real errand was to serve the young Prince of Scotland,\r\nto animate his friends, to excite the malcontents, to promise money,\r\ntitles, and prepare the Jacobites of South Britain for the tempest that\r\nwas gathering among the mountains of the north. By his boldness and\r\ndetermination Lally met with the utmost success in London; but being\r\nsomewhat unwary, his plans and presence were discovered and revealed\r\nby a spy to the Duke of Cumberland, who procured immediate orders for\r\nhis arrest.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, Lally escaped those shambles to which \"the\r\nbutcher\" of the clans had doomed him, and escaping to France about the\r\ntime Culloden was fought, resumed the command of his regiment.\r\n\r\nA war was then waging between France and Britain, and the fleets of the\r\nlatter had swept those of the former from the ocean. Admiral Hawke had\r\ndestroyed the French fleet at Belleisle, and in that year upwards of\r\nsix hundred prizes were taken by our cruisers.\r\n\r\nThough the French armies performed some brilliant actions in the\r\nNetherlands, where the Marshal-General, Maurice Count de Saxe, defeated\r\nand covered with disgrace the troops of the Duke of Cumberland, Louis\r\nXV. was compelled by naval disasters, and the internal distresses\r\nof France, to conclude a peace, a congress for which met at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle in April, 1748; and the definitive treaty was signed in\r\nthe following October.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, and until his promotion to the rank of\r\nlieutenant-general and commander-in-chief in the East Indies, the life\r\nof Lally--who had now been created a peer of France--does not present\r\nany circumstance or incident worthy of attention. In 1749 he married.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 a dispute pregnant with hostility ensued between France and\r\nBritain respecting their mutual claims in North America; various\r\ncircumstances which occurred in the East Indies about the same time\r\nconfirmed the idea that the short peace concluded in 1748 was about to\r\nend. Each country prepared for war; but though many unfriendly acts\r\nwere committed, and bitter recriminations exchanged between the Courts\r\nof London and Versailles, until Britain was threatened with invasion,\r\nas a curb on her aggressive spirit, hostilities were not formally\r\ndenounced until the month of June, 1756. The declaration made by George\r\nII. was mild and moderate in tenor and language, but the declaration\r\npromulgated by Louis XV. was full of severity and opprobrium. Prussia\r\nbecame the ally of the former; Sweden and Russia joined the latter.\r\nIn distant regions as well as at home the sanguinary struggle was\r\nmaintained, and in America France was stripped of all her possessions\r\nby the army of the heroic Wolfe.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the declaration of war, in the month of August, 1756,\r\nthe Count de Lally, as Lieutenant-General and Commander-in-Chief of all\r\nhis Most Christian Majesty's forces in India, was appointed to conduct\r\nan expedition destined for those burning shores, so far distant, and\r\neven at that period comparatively so little known to Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn support of this expedition the Court had destined six millions of\r\nlivres, six strong battalions of infantry, and three ships of war,\r\nwhich were to co-operate with such an armament as the French India\r\nCompany could furnish; but the whole of the troops did not embark.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th February, 1757, the Count de Lally, accompanied by his\r\nbrother Michael, marched to Brest at the head of two battalions; and\r\nthough having only two millions of livres in the military chest,\r\nembarked on board the ships of the Count d'Aché, who immediately put to\r\nsea; but being driven into port again by contrary winds, the squadron\r\nwas detained until the 2nd of May.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Major-General the Chevalier des Soupirs, Lally's second in\r\ncommand, had already reached the Indian Ocean, having departed from\r\nL'Orient, the principal port of the India Company, on the 30th of the\r\npreceding December, with two battalions and two millions of livres,\r\nwith which he touched at the Isle of France, without accident.\r\n\r\nThe general had very ample and important instructions given to him by\r\nthe India Company. Some of these were to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n\"The Sieur de Lally is authorized to destroy the fortifications of\r\nall maritime settlements which may be taken from the English; it may,\r\nhowever, be proper to except Vizagapatam, by reason of its being so\r\nnearly situated to Bemelipatana, which in that case would be enriched\r\nby the ruin of Vizagapatam; but as to that, and the demolition of\r\nall other places, the Sieur de Lally is to consult the Governor and\r\nSuperior Council of Pondicherry, and to have their opinion in writing;\r\nbut, notwithstanding, he is to destroy such places as he shall think\r\nproper, unless strong and sufficient arguments are made use of to the\r\ncontrary; such, for example, as the Company being apprehensive for\r\nsome of their settlements, and that it would then be thought prudent\r\nand necessary to reserve the power of exchange in case any of them\r\nshould be lost. Nevertheless, if the Sieur de Lally should think it\r\ntoo hazardous to keep a place, or could not do so without dividing or\r\nweakening his army, then his Majesty leaves him to act as he may deem\r\nproper for the good of the service.\r\n\r\n\"The Sieur de Lally is to allow of no English settlement being\r\nransomed, as we may well remember that, after the taking of Madras\r\nlast war, the English Company in their Council of the 14th of July,\r\n1747, determined that all ransoms made in India should be annulled. In\r\nregard to the English troops, both officers and writers belonging to\r\nthe Company, and to the inhabitants of that nation, the Sieur de Lally\r\nis to permit none of them to remain on the coast of Coromandel; he may,\r\nif he pleases, permit the inhabitants to go to England, and order them\r\nto be conducted in armed vessels to St. Helena. But as to the officers,\r\nsoldiers, writers, and sailors belonging to the East India Company, he\r\nis to conduct them as soon as possible to the Isle de Bourbon, where\r\nthe soldiers and sailors will be permitted to work for the inhabitants\r\nof that place, according to mutual agreement. It is by no means his\r\nMajesty's intention that the English officers, soldiers, and sailors\r\nshould be ransomed, as none are to be delivered up but by exchange, man\r\nfor man, according to their different ranks and stations.\r\n\r\n\"If the exchange of prisoners should by chance be settled at home\r\nbetween the two nations, of which proper notice will be given to the\r\nSieur de Lally, and that the islands of France and Bourbon should have\r\nmore prisoners than it would be convenient to provide for, in that case\r\nit will be permitted to send a certain number to England, in a vessel\r\narmed for the purpose. No English officers, soldiers, &c., are to be\r\npermitted to remain in a place after it is taken; neither are they to\r\nretire to any other of their settlements.\r\n\r\n\"The Sieur de Lally is not in the least to deviate from the above\r\ninstructions and regulations, unless there shall be a stipulation\r\nto the contrary; in which case the Sieur de Lally is faithfully and\r\nhonestly to adhere to the capitulation.\r\n\r\n\"The whole of what has been said before concerns only natives of\r\nEngland; but as they have in their settlements merchants from all\r\nnations, such as Moors, Armenians, Jews, Pattaners, &c., the Sieur de\r\nLally is ordered to treat them with humanity, and endeavour by fair\r\nmeans to engage them to retire to Pondicherry, or any other of the\r\nCompany's acquisitions, assuring them at the same time that they will\r\nbe protected, and that the same liberty and privileges which they\r\nbefore possessed among the English will be granted them.\r\n\r\n\"Among the recruits furnished to complete the regiments of Lorrain and\r\nBerry, there are three hundred men from Fisher's corps, lately raised,\r\nand as it is feared there will be considerable desertions among these\r\nnew recruits, the Sieur de Lally may, if he pleases, leave them on the\r\nIsle de France, and replace them from the troops of that island.\"[1]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving France, Lally had placed his son, Trophine Gerard,\r\nwho had been born at Paris on the 5th March, 1751, at the College of\r\nHarcourt, intending that he should ultimately follow the profession of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThough impetuous and at times apt to be somewhat overbearing, Lally\r\nwas eminently fitted for command. He possessed secrecy, with a ready\r\nfacility for quick and judicious decision. His talent was evinced by\r\nthe manner in which he established magazines, extended his posts and\r\ndefences, and made himself acquainted with the character and features\r\nof the country which was to be the scene of his future operations. His\r\nlofty demeanour, talent, tact, and bravery inspired his troops with\r\nconfidence and an assurance of conquest. If Lally was fond of glory,\r\nhe was also fond of flattery; and though a strict disciplinarian, he\r\nwas somewhat too partial, perhaps, to levying contribution on the\r\nconquered provinces; but while his enemies in after years averred that\r\nhe was grasping, they never denied that he was lavish and liberal when\r\nthe king's service required him by spies to obtain intelligence of the\r\nstrength and designs of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Count d'Aché, Chef d'Escadre, encountered such adverse winds that\r\nhe was nearly twelve months on his voyage; thus the Chevalier des\r\nSoupirs, having wearied of waiting at the Mauritius, sailed towards\r\nthe coast of Hindostan, and reaching Pondicherry (or _Puducheri_),\r\ndisembarked his troops.\r\n\r\nThis town was the capital of the French settlements in India, being\r\nrestored to them by the Dutch after the Treaty of Ryswick. It occupied\r\na good position in the rich, fertile, and populous Carnatic, a\r\ncountry studded by an incredible number of forts and strongholds.\r\nTheir erection was an indispensable necessity in a level district\r\nfull of open towns, subject to the sudden attacks of hordes of native\r\ncavalry. The sovereigns of the Carnatic must have possessed at one\r\nperiod immense wealth and power, for the number and magnitude of their\r\npagodas, and the indications that remain of ancient riches, grandeur,\r\npopulation, industry and art, impress the mind with wonder.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the funds and forces of the British in that part of\r\nIndia were so small, that they could scarcely bring one hundred\r\nsoldiers into the field. Madras, one of their principal places,\r\nsixty-three miles distant, was an open town; Fort St. David was in\r\nruins, with a garrison of only sixty invalids. A fortnight would have\r\nenabled the Chevalier, with his 2000 men, to reduce the whole coast\r\nof Coromandel; but M. des Soupirs was quite unskilled in the art of\r\ncarrying on war in a country so new to him, and remained inactive,\r\nthough the French had many losses to repair, having been recently\r\ndriven from all their wealthy settlements in Bengal by the victorious\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nEight months after his arrival, on the 25th April, 1758, the Chef\r\nd'Escadre anchored in the roadstead before the sandy plain occupied by\r\nPondicherry, and Lally disembarking his troops and treasure, marched\r\ninto the town, the governor of which, M. de Leyrit, received him with\r\na salute of cannon. At the peace of Amiens, the French population of\r\nPondicherry amounted to 25,000, exclusive of the blacks, who were\r\ntreble that number. Its revenue was then 40,000 pagodas; but it was\r\na place destitute of natural advantages, its vicinity producing only\r\npalm-trees, millet, and a few herbs.\r\n\r\nWeary of his long voyage, and anxious to fulfil his orders, which\r\ncomprehended the total destruction of every British fortification that\r\nfell into his power, the ardent and gallant Lally lost not an hour in\r\npreparing for active operations. Next day, the 26th, he returned on\r\nboard to sail for Cudalore, and in one hour after a powerful British\r\nfleet assailed the ships of Count d'Aché in the roadstead, where a\r\nFrench 74-gun ship was taken; but the rest fought a passage to the\r\nseaward, and favoured by the wind, and by superior sailing, anchored\r\noff Cudalore, a town situated fifteen miles from Pondicherry, on the\r\nwestern shore of the Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThis little town, which occupies the banks of the Pennar, had been\r\nobtained by the English East India Company from the Rajah of Gingee,\r\nso early as 1681, for the site of a factory, and had been fortified.\r\nIts garrison consisted only of ten invalids; but being assisted by the\r\ninhabitants, these brave fellows made so stout a resistance, that Lally\r\nwas occupied three days in taking it. From thence he marched to Fort\r\nSt. David, a settlement on the Carnatic coast, obtained by the English\r\nfrom a Mahratta rajah in 1691, and besieging it, after being seventeen\r\ndays in open trenches, exposed to the broiling sun by noon and the\r\nbaleful dews by night, gained it by capitulation on the 2nd of June,\r\nand levelled all its fortifications to the ground.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th he marched back to Pondicherry, and having resolved to\r\nassail Madras, despatched an officer in a small vessel to his naval\r\nChef d'Escadre, with instructions to return and co-operate with him.\r\nBut Admiral Pocock, who commanded the British squadron in those seas,\r\nhad defeated M. d'Aché in two engagements, and by driving him sixty\r\nmiles to the windward, had nearly cut off all communication between him\r\nand the army. And now the governor of Pondicherry announced that the\r\ntown and its vicinity could not subsist Lally's 4000 Frenchmen for more\r\nthan fifteen days. On this he was compelled to march into the little\r\nkingdom of Tanjore (or Tanjowar), which lay one hundred and fifty miles\r\nsouthward, and there quarter his troops during the stormy and rainy\r\nseason, while the naval squadron took refuge in port. The advance into\r\nTanjowar was not made without a due pretence of wrong to adjust, for\r\nthe rajah had refused to pay a government debt, which M. de Leyrit\r\nassured Count Lally to be more than due.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of five pieces of cannon against his little capital\r\ncompelled the rajah to pay down treasure to the amount of 440,000\r\nlivres, and afford free-quarters to the French troops for two\r\nmonths, until tidings arrived that 800 British were marching against\r\nPondicherry; upon which Lally immediately abandoned Tanjowar, and\r\nadvanced to the relief of the Chevalier des Soupirs, who with a slender\r\nforce was timidly preparing to evacuate the capital of French India.\r\n\r\nOn Lally approaching, on the 31st of August, the British detachment\r\nfell back on Madras, and now our indefatigable Irishman, full of the\r\nmost sanguine hopes of expelling them from the vast peninsula of\r\nHindostan, at once made new preparations for investing Fort St. George,\r\ntheir principal settlement on the coast of Coromandel; but scarcity of\r\nmoney, and the improper conduct of the naval Chef d'Escadre, retarded\r\nthe operations, frustrated the bold intentions of Lally, and ultimately\r\nbetrayed them to the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhile sparing no exertions to officer and equip a body of sepoy\r\ninfantry, he seized a Dutch ship, in which he found a sufficient\r\nquantity of specie to enable him to attack Madras; he then sent a\r\nmessage to the Count d'Aché not to leave the coast; but the count\r\nreplied, that he required a recruit of seamen, and must return to\r\nFrance. Alarmed by such a threat, Lally offered him half of his\r\nsoldiers for the marine service; but deaf alike to threats and\r\nentreaties, the count sailed for the Straits of Madagascar on the 1st\r\nof September, and left Lally to cope single handed with the British\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nOn summoning to his presence M. de Bussy, who commanded the French\r\ntroops in that extensive region named the Deccan (or Country of the\r\nSouth), and M. Moracin, who commanded at the seaport of Masulipatnam,\r\nhe found these officers were somewhat influenced by the same pride and\r\ndisobedience which characterized the conduct of Count d'Aché; and thus,\r\nbefore they would obey, and march against Madras, they required that\r\nLally should embody an additional thousand men. He immediately ordered\r\nM. Moracin to return to his post, which the British were approaching.\r\nM. Moracin dared to refuse or delay, and taken by surprise during his\r\nabsence, Masulipatnam was lost to France for ever.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, Lally, with his slender force, the flower of\r\nwhich was the valiant Regiment de Lorraine, marched without opposition\r\ninto the extensive district of Arcot (which seven years before had been\r\noverrun by Colonel Clive), and after remaining there at free-quarters\r\nfor five days, marched back to Pondicherry.\r\n\r\nThe army was now totally destitute of pay, and the commissariat had no\r\nsupply but plunder, while the departure of the Count d'Aché cut off\r\nall succour or retreat by the seaward. Though numerous, the troubles\r\nof Lally were just commencing. Discouraged and disunited by the naval\r\ndisasters of d'Aché, the French officers were alternately fired with\r\nardour and depressed by despair. M. de Bussy offered to raise 400,000\r\nlivres in three hours, if he was permitted to re-enter the Deccan\r\nwith a body of troops; but being loth to divide his little force, and\r\nbelieving the result to be incredible, Lally wisely declined. De Bussy\r\nthen informed him that he had 240,000 livres belonging to the East\r\nIndia Company, which were at his service if _he_ would be responsible\r\nfor them; but Lally still more wisely declined to compromise his\r\nhonour by appropriating the money of the merchants to the service of\r\nthe nation. He resumed his preparations for the siege of Madras while\r\nthe British fleet was absent from its shore; but this measure was\r\nvehemently opposed by the Governor of Pondicherry, M. Duval de Leyrit,\r\nwho urged the wretched state of the commissariat and the empty military\r\nchest. Lally's Irish spirit could ill brook such disputations, and,\r\n\"pay or no pay,\" he was for marching at once.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was compelled to take the opinion of the General Council\r\nof Pondicherry, some of whom adhered to De Leyrit; but five, headed by\r\nM. le Comte d'Estaigne, offered their plate, to the value of 80,000\r\nlivres, towards the expense of the expedition. The true and generous\r\nLally gave, from his private purse, 140,000 livres; and having thus in\r\nsome measure collected the sinews of war, with his small head-quarter\r\nforce, 2700 French, and a body of sepoys, he advanced towards Madras\r\nearly in December.\r\n\r\nA march of sixty-three miles brought Lally, on the 12th day of the\r\nmonth, in sight of the town, which, by its strength, wealth, and annual\r\nrevenue in calicos and muslins, was of such great consequence, even\r\nthen, to the growing English East India Company. The diamond mines\r\nwere only a week's journey distant, and the rumour of their priceless\r\nwealth, and splendid wonders, animated the French soldiers, as in three\r\ndivisions they marched across the sunny plains of Choultry.\r\n\r\nMadras, or Fort St George, was divided into two parts; one called\r\n_the Black_, and the other _the White_ town. The former, Madraspatam,\r\nhad been totally destroyed by the French in 1744, when they levelled\r\nto the ground every building that stood within three hundred yards\r\nof the fort. The walls of the latter, which rose above the centre\r\nof the English town were--as dispatches relate--all built of hard,\r\niron-coloured stone, and defended by four gigantic bastions. The inner\r\nfort, or citadel, had a front of one hundred and eight yards; the outer\r\nfort consisted of half-moons, curtain-walls, and flankers, which, like\r\nthe rusty-coloured ramparts of the town were studded by an incredible\r\nnumber of cannon. In short, the aspect of Madras, with its mansions\r\ncovered by snow-white _chunam_, is delightful from the ocean, and\r\nmagnificent from the land. On the latter, its walls are moated by a\r\nriver, which falls into the sea on that flat and sandy shore, where a\r\nwhite and furious surf is ever rolling in mountains of foam.\r\n\r\nAs he crossed the plains, Lally was briskly cannonaded by the\r\nfield-pieces of the enemy, and lost many officers and men; but,\r\nadvancing steadily, took possession of Ogmore and Meliapore (or San\r\nThomé), an old town of the Portuguese, who had built there a large\r\nchurch above a grave reputed to be that of St. Thomas, who had been\r\nmurdered by a tribe that dwelt in the vicinity, and whose _right legs_,\r\nafter that sacrilegious act, were, according to Dr. Fryar, swollen to\r\nthe size of those of elephants.\r\n\r\nColonel Lawrence, a gallant and resolute officer, who commanded the\r\ngarrison of Madras, was ably seconded by Pigot the governor, by Colonel\r\nDraper, Major Caillaud, and other gentlemen. Thus Lally encountered\r\nthe most determined resistance. The garrison consisted of 5000 men; of\r\nthese, 1600 were regular troops of the British line, 300 were sepoys,\r\nand 400 were servants of the East India Company. Lawrence retired to\r\nthe island in order to prevent the French from obtaining possession\r\nof the island bridge, and ordered all the posts to be occupied in\r\nthe Black Town, which was triangularly shaped, and surrounded by a\r\nfortified wall.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, on the morning of the 14th December, Lally sent forward\r\nM. de Rillon at the head of his regiment, which assailed the Black\r\nTown with great spirit, and after giving and receiving several severe\r\ndischarges of musketry, during a contest of some hours, gained the\r\nplace, driving back the British, who retired by detachments into the\r\nfort or citadel of Madras. This successful movement was followed by\r\nan advance of the Regiment de Lorraine, to keep the ground De Rillon\r\nhad won; but within an hour, a grand _sortie_ was made upon them by a\r\nbody of British infantry, led by Colonel Draper, who behaved with great\r\npersonal bravery.\r\n\r\nShrouded in smoke, he led a charge of bayonets against the Regiment\r\nde Lorraine; a furious _mêlée_ ensued, and the French must have been\r\ndriven back, or cut off, had not Lally sent forward another detachment,\r\nwith some sepoys, to sustain the troops of M. de Rillon. A great\r\nnumber of officers and men were shot or bayoneted on both sides; but\r\nColonel Draper was compelled to retreat, for his grenadiers gave way\r\nin a somewhat discreditable manner. After this, the garrison of Madras\r\ncontented themselves by defending their works, being too weak to engage\r\nin _sorties_ beyond them.\r\n\r\nColonel, afterwards Sir William Draper, was that _preux chevalier_\r\nwho afterwards conquered Manilla, and became a paramount judge in all\r\nmatters of military etiquette, and who, in his celebrated letter to\r\nJunius, expressed a hope that he would never see officers pushed into\r\nthe British army who had nothing to lose but their _swords_.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, by hemming in the enemy, Lally continued to push his\r\napproaches, and build batteries. Meanwhile M. de Lequille, another\r\nChef d'Escadre, had arrived at the Isle de France, with four ships\r\nof war and three millions of livres, destined for the service of the\r\nFrench India Company. When about to leave the isle for the roads of\r\nPondicherry, he unfortunately met the discomfited fleet of the Count\r\nd'Aché, who, being his superior officer, prevented him from proceeding,\r\nand removed the treasure on board his own ship, taking upon himself to\r\nsend only _one_ million of livres to the Count de Lally, in a small\r\nfrigate, which reached Pondicherry on the 21st December, 1758.\r\n\r\nThis supply enabled Lally to press the siege with greater vigour,\r\nand to pay his French soldiers and Indian levies a portion of their\r\narrears; but the blacks were of little service to him during the\r\noperations. M. Lally erected several batteries against the Black Town\r\nand Fort St. George; one of these, called the Grand Battery, was 450\r\nyards distance from the glacis. They opened on the 6th January, 1759;\r\nafter which they maintained a continued discharge of shot and shells\r\nfor twenty days, the pioneers pushing on the trenches until their sap\r\nhad reached the base of the glacis, within pistol-shot of the parapets.\r\nThen Lally formed another and loftier battery, on which he placed four\r\npieces of heavy cannon. It opened on the 31st of January; but for five\r\nconsecutive days the artillerists were compelled to close up their\r\nembrasures with fascines and earth, for the superior fire of the fort\r\nwas not to be withstood, and it soon compelled them to abandon their\r\nredoubt. The Grand Battery, however, still continued a fire, which\r\nwas so well directed, that it dismounted or broke twenty-six pieces\r\nof cannon and three mortars, beating down the wall and effecting a\r\nconsiderable breach.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations, Lally had somewhat needlessly bombarded the\r\ntown, to terrify the inhabitants, and demolished a number of their\r\nhouses; but the precautions of Governor Pigot, the vigilance, valour,\r\nand experience of Colonels Draper, Lawrence, and Major Brereton\r\nrepelled every attack; and thus, after the 5th of February, the fire\r\nof Lally's batteries gradually diminished from twenty-three to six\r\npieces of cannon. Money, powder, and shot became scarce together; he\r\nhad lost many of his bravest men; two months had elapsed, and still the\r\nBritish standard waved above the fort of Madras. During this period\r\nthe remonstrances which Lally sent frequently to France for succour,\r\ndescribe the deep anxiety he felt for the success of a cause in which\r\nhis honour was implicated; and so keen and bitter did this feeling\r\nbecome, that at times, when aggravated by an illness incident to the\r\nclimate, his reports and dispatches are remarkable for containing\r\noccasional sentences expressive of horror and distraction.\r\n\r\nHis general chagrin at the conduct of Count d'Aché and others is\r\nstrongly portrayed in the following letter, which he addressed from the\r\ntrenches at Madras to the Governor of Pondicherry, and which had been\r\nintercepted:--\r\n\r\n \"M. DUVAL DE LEYRIT,--A good blow might be struck here; there is in\r\n the roads a 20-gun ship laden with all the riches of Madras; she\r\n will remain there till the 20th. The _Expedition_ is just arrived,\r\n but M. Gerlin is not a man to attack her, for she made him run away\r\n once before. The _Bristol_, on the other hand, did but just make her\r\n appearance before San Thomé, and on the vague report of thirteen\r\n ships coming from Porto Nova, she took fright, and, after landing the\r\n provisions with which she was laden, she would not stay even long\r\n enough to take on board twelve of her own guns, which she had lent us\r\n for the siege (of Madras).\r\n\r\n \"If I was to judge of the point of honour of the Company's officers, I\r\n would break him like glass, as well as some others of them.\r\n\r\n \"The _Fidele_, or the _Haerlem_, or even the aforesaid _Bristol_,\r\n with her twelve guns restored to her, would be sufficient to make\r\n themselves masters of the British ship, if they could get to windward\r\n of her in the night. Maugendre and Tremillier are said to be good men,\r\n and were they employed to transport 200 wounded we have here, their\r\n service would be of importance. We remain in the same position; the\r\n breach made these fifteen days; all the time within fifteen toises of\r\n the place, and never holding up our heads to look at it. I believe we\r\n must, on our return to Pondicherry, learn some _other trade_, for this\r\n of war requires too much patience.\r\n\r\n \"Of the 1500 sepoys who attended our army, I believe nearly 800 are\r\n employed upon the road to Pondicherry, laden with pepper, sugar, and\r\n other goods; and as for the coolies, they have been employed for\r\n the same purpose since the first days we came here. I am taking my\r\n measures from this day to set fire to the Black Town and to blow up\r\n the powder-mills.\r\n\r\n \"You will never imagine that fifty French deserters and 100 Swiss\r\n are actually stopping the progress of 2000 men of the king's and\r\n Company's troops, which are still here existing, notwithstanding the\r\n exaggerated accounts that every one makes, according to his own fancy,\r\n of the slaughter that has been made among them; and you will be still\r\n more surprised if I tell you that, were it not for the combats and\r\n four battles we sustained, and for the batteries which failed, or\r\n (to speak more properly) which were unskilfully made, we should not\r\n have lost fifty men from the commencement of the siege to this day.\r\n I have written to M. de Larche, that if he persists in not coming\r\n here, let who will raise money upon the Poleagers for me, I will\r\n not do it! And I renounce--as I informed you a month ago--meddling\r\n directly or indirectly with anything whatever that may relate to your\r\n administration, civil or military. For I would rather go and command\r\n the Caffres of Madagascar than remain in this Sodom, which the fire of\r\n the English must sooner or later destroy, if that from heaven should\r\n not. I have the honour to be, &c.,\r\n\r\n \"Lally.\r\n\r\n \"P.S.--I think it necessary to apprise you that, as M. des Soupirs\r\n has refused to take upon him the command of this army, which I have\r\n offered him, and which he is empowered to accept, by having received\r\n from the Court a duplicate of my commission, you must necessarily,\r\n with the council, take it upon you. For my part, I undertake only\r\n to bring it back either to Arcot or Sadraste. Send, therefore, your\r\n orders, or come yourselves to command it, for I shall quit it upon my\r\n arrival there.--L.\"\r\n\r\nThough his cannonade had been diminished to only six pieces, Lally had\r\nadvanced his sap along the seashore by cutting a trench about ten feet\r\nbroad, with traverses to cover the soldiers, until he embraced the\r\nwhole north-east angle of the covered way, from whence the Regiment\r\nde Lorraine, by a well directed mousquetade, drove the besieged in\r\ndisorder. An attempt to open a passage into the ditch by mining failed,\r\nfor the mine was sprung without effect.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Major Caillaud and Captain Preston, a Scottish officer, with\r\na body of sepoys, another of Indian cavalry, and some European soldiers\r\ndrawn from the British garrisons at Trinchinopoli and Chingalaput\r\n(which Clive when a captain had taken from the French in 1752), hovered\r\non the roads a few miles from Madras, blocking up the avenues, cutting\r\noff succour and provisions from Pondicherry, thus compelling Lally\r\nfour times (as his better states) to drive them back by detachments.\r\nThese measures successfully retarded the siege until the 16th February,\r\nwhen, at the very time he was preparing for a grand assault at point\r\nof the bayonet, his Britannic Majesty's ship _Queensberry_, commanded\r\nby Captain Kempenfeldt, the Company's ship _Revenge_, and four other\r\nvessels, having on board 600 men of the 79th, or Colonel Draper's\r\nregiment, with a great supply of provision of every kind, came to\r\nanchor in the roadstead, and the troops were immediately disembarked\r\nand marched into Madras. The rage and mortification of Lally were now\r\ncomplete!\r\n\r\nHe had encountered innumerable difficulties occasioned by the scarcity\r\nof money and munition, by the wretched supplies of the Government\r\ncommissaries and contractors, by the conduct of Count d'Aché and\r\nothers, by the sinking of his soldiers' courage before the obstinate\r\ndefence of the besieged; and now, with Kempenfeldt's arrival all hope\r\nof success vanished. After maintaining a smart cannonade until the\r\nnight of the 16th closed over Madras, Lally abandoned his trenches, and\r\nwas compelled by scarcity of horses to leave forty pieces of cannon\r\nbehind him: he blew up the powder-mills of Ogmore and retreated into\r\nArcot.\r\n\r\nSoon after this siege had been abandoned, the British received from\r\nhome another reinforcement of 600 infantry, and on the 16th April the\r\nmain body of their troops, which had been centred at Madras for its\r\nprotection, took the field in three divisions against Lally, under the\r\ncommand of Major Brereton. The Chevalier des Soupirs felt the first\r\nbrunt of this movement, being driven by the Major from Conjeveram, a\r\nlarge and handsome town, principally inhabited by Brahmins, which lies\r\nforty-four miles from Madras, and had the chief manufacture of turbans\r\nand red handkerchiefs. Major Forde, with another division, took by\r\nassault the town of Masulipatnam, the governor of which, M. Moracin,\r\nwas still absent, as before related. The garrison, which was commanded\r\nby the Marquis de Conflans, had been weakened by the withdrawal of its\r\nsoldiers to the siege of Madras. Thus the commerce of Britain secured\r\na sea-coast of at least eight hundred miles in length along a country\r\nteeming with wealth and commerce, while that of France was almost\r\nconfined to the narrow limits of Pondicherry. The third division of\r\nBritish under Colonel Clive was meanwhile advancing from the province\r\nof Bengal to assist the Rajah of Visanapore, who had driven the French\r\nout of Vizagapatam, and hoisted thereon the British flag.\r\n\r\nThe first severe shock sustained by the arms of Britain in the East\r\nwas given by the gallant Lally in person. Sensible of the importance\r\nof such a place as Conjeveram, which with the fort of Chingelpel,\r\ncommanded all the adjacent country and secured the British conquests to\r\nthe northward, he marched towards Major Brereton, and took up a strong\r\nposition at Vandivash. There he cantoned his troops until the month\r\nof September, when Brereton, on receiving 300 men under Major Gordon,\r\nfrom Colonel Coote's Bengalese force, resolved on beating up the French\r\nin their quarters. Accordingly, on the 14th March he advanced from\r\nConjeveram, at the head of 400 European infantry, 7000 sepoys, seventy\r\nEuropean and 300 native horsemen, with fourteen pieces of artillery.\r\n\r\nAfter capturing the fort of Trivitar, he advanced against the village\r\nof Vandivash, where Lally, although still struggling with a severe\r\nillness, had formed a strong intrenched camp, the lines of which were\r\nprotected by a redoubt commanded by a rajah, and mounted with twenty\r\npieces of cannon worked by Indians, under the directions of a single\r\nFrench cannonier.\r\n\r\nAt two on the morning of the 30th September the British attacked the\r\nvillage on three points, and on all with equal fury and determination.\r\nThe French infantry, 1000 strong, made a spirited resistance; and\r\nthe moment daylight broke, the guns of the rajah poured a storm of\r\ngrape-shot upon the ranks of the enemy.\r\n\r\nLally did all that ability and gallantry could inspire to animate his\r\ntroops; but being deserted by his black pioneers, who (like those of\r\nBrereton) fled at the moment of attack, the French were discouraged,\r\nand retired beyond a deep dry ditch, from whence the regiments of Lally\r\nand Lorraine made a succession of desperate sallies on the British,\r\nuntil, seeing that the column of Anglo-Indian horse were watching for\r\nan opportunity to fall upon his flanks, Lally, to preserve his little\r\nforce from utter ruin, brought up his reserve to cover the retreat, and\r\nfell back, after the loss of many gallant chevaliers and 400 soldiers.\r\nBrereton and Gordon remained encamped in sight of the fort for some\r\ndays; but the approach of the rainy season compelled them to retire\r\ninto Conjeveram.\r\n\r\nThe Fort of Vandivash was afterwards garrisoned by French and sepoys,\r\nwhile another column of King Louis's troops assembled in Arcot, under\r\nBrigadier-General the Marquis de Bussy, who endeavoured to levy as\r\nmany sepoys as possible. These native troops, whose now familiar name\r\nis derived from _Sepahe_, the Indian word for a feudatory chief or\r\nmilitary tenant, have ever made excellent soldiers, having an inborn\r\npredilection for arms. The success at Vandivash, for giving the British\r\neven a _check_ was now deemed almost equal to a victory, made Lally\r\nconceive the idea of besieging Trinchinopoli; but again the folly or\r\nthe treachery of the naval Chef d'Escadre baffled his intentions.\r\n\r\nAfter having a third engagement with the British fleet on the 4th\r\nSeptember, when with eleven ships of the line he was as usual defeated\r\nby Admiral Pocock with nine, the Count d'Aché, on the 17th, reached\r\nthe roads of Pondicherry, from whence he wrote to the Count de Lally,\r\nthen in position before Vandivash, offering to place at his disposal,\r\nfor the king's service, 800,000 livres in piastres and diamonds, being\r\nthe plunder of a British ship which he had taken at sea, and which\r\nhe begged the lieutenant-general to receive as part payment of the\r\ntwo millions so improperly detained in the preceding year at the Isle\r\nof France. He concluded his dispatch by a notification that on the\r\nfollowing day, the 18th September, he would sail towards Madagascar.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when British valour was bearing all before it; when\r\nthe powerful fortress of Karical (which the King of Tanjowar had\r\nceded to France in 1739) was about to fall, and he lost, with all the\r\nfertile district around it; when the united fleets of Admirals Pocock,\r\nK.B., and Sir Samuel Cornish were sweeping along the shores of the\r\nCarnatic, reducing many places of minor importance, and by their cannon\r\neverywhere beating down the _Fleur-de-lys_ of France; when Colonel\r\nEyre Coote was pressing the French and their allies along the frontier\r\nof Bengal, and when the Prince of Vizanapore and other native rajahs\r\nwere in open revolt against King Louis,--the announcement of the Chef\r\nd'Escadre filled the colonists with fear and confusion. Indignant and\r\nexasperated, Lally would have left the camp and sought Count d'Aché in\r\nperson; but at that crisis, being so reduced by sickness that he could\r\nnot quit his bed, he sent a deputation of field officers to represent\r\nthe necessity of his remaining in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nCarnatic coast; of his co-operating with the land forces, and conjuring\r\nhim by all means to suspend the execution of a design so pregnant\r\nwith disaster to the Indian interests of his Most Christian Majesty.\r\nBut nothing that these officers could urge, or their united eloquence\r\nsuggest, would avert the fatal purpose of the Count d'Aché, who put\r\nto sea, and once more left the disheartened soldiers of King Louis to\r\ntheir fate.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon this Lally assembled the Council and drew up a\r\nsolemn PROTEST against the unaccountable conduct and sudden departure\r\nof the Chef d'Escadre and his fleet, proclaiming that he--and _he\r\nalone_--would be responsible if Pondicherry, the capital of French\r\nIndia, with all its territory fell into the hands of the British army\r\nand revolted rajahs. The \"protest\" was dated on the 17th of September,\r\n1759, and was unanimously signed in the Hall of Fort Lewis, at\r\nPondicherry, by Lally himself and the following gentlemen:--\r\n\r\n\"Duval de Leyrit, Renaut, Barthelmy, Chevalier des Soupirs, Michael\r\nLally, Bussy, Du Bois, Carrière, Verdières, Duré, Gaddeville, Du\r\nPassage, Beausset, Renaut, De la Salle, Guillart, Porcher, Père\r\nDominique, _Capucin Prêtre de la Paroisse de Notre Dame des Anges,\r\nF.S.

Nicolas, Du Plan, De\r\nLaval, Borée, D. l'Arché, Bayelleon de Guillette.\"\r\n\r\nThe count had already sailed; but strong currents and adverse winds,\r\nhowever, met his fleet, which was driven far to the north; thus the\r\nprotest of Lally overtook him at sea. Influenced by its tenor, he\r\nreturned to Pondicherry, and after remaining one week in the roadstead,\r\nagain departed for his favourite island of Madagascar, and for _sixteen\r\nmonths_ Lally and his soldiers heard no more of him.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Council of the British India Company at Madras having\r\nheard that Lally had sent a detachment of his forces southward and\r\nthreatened Trinchinopoli, determined that Colonel Eyre Coote, who had\r\nrecently arrived in the East, should take the field and drive it back.\r\n\r\nThe French officers had been fortunate in acquiring the favour of many\r\nof the Indian chiefs. Thus in 1755 the King of Travancore employed M.\r\nde Launay to discipline 10,000 Naires of Malabar in the mode of the\r\nEuropean infantry; and thus M. de Lally, who had won the alliance of\r\nSalubetzingue, sovereign of the whole country, expected the arrival\r\nof his brother Bassuletzingue with a column of 12,000 Indians. When\r\nmore than a hundred miles distant from the French army, the prince\r\nsent a Rissaldar to request that an officer of rank with a body of\r\nFrench should be sent to facilitate their junction. Lally immediately\r\ndespatched the Marquis de Bussy on this service, with a detachment\r\nwhich joined the prince beneath the walls of Arcot. In twelve days all\r\nthat was necessary might have been done; but the loitering marquis spun\r\nout the time to no less than two-and-forty. While Lally was totally\r\nunable to account for his absence, a dangerous ferment arose in the\r\ncamp of Prince Bassuletzingue, there being no pay for his soldiers, as\r\nM. d'Aché's diamonds were yet unsold; and during the delay the British\r\ntroops under Colonel Coote (aware that Lally could not begin a campaign\r\nwithout cavalry) suddenly made themselves masters of Vandivash on the\r\n30th November, after having breached the walls. Thus, by the indolence\r\nof M. de Bussy one of the most important fortresses on the coast was\r\nlost, and its garrison of 900 men taken, with forty-nine pieces of\r\ncannon and a vast quantity of ammunition.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th December they took Cosangoli, which was bravely defended by\r\na mixed garrison of French and sepoys under Colonel O'Kennely, an Irish\r\nofficer; who, after his guns were dismounted, capitulated and marched\r\nout with all the honours of war. With 100 Frenchmen he joined Lally,\r\nbut 500 of his sepoys were disarmed and dismissed by Coote.\r\n\r\nThe double and dangerous success of this vigilant and enterprising\r\nofficer compelled Lally to attempt a decisive demonstration for the\r\nrecapture of Vandivash; but Coote, who had completely superseded\r\nBrereton in the command, was an officer who ably defended the conquests\r\nhis bravery had made.\r\n\r\nHaving now somewhat recovered his health and strength, on the 10th\r\nJanuary, 1760, the Lieutenant-General du Roi marched towards the\r\ncaptured fortress at the head of 2200 Frenchmen, and about 10,000\r\nnative troops. Among the latter were 1800 blacks called the Regiment de\r\nBussy, 300 Caffres, and 2000 cavalry obtained from a Mahratta chief,\r\nwith whom Lally had concluded a treaty, as soon as he found himself\r\ndisappointed by Prince Bassuletzingue. They were all clothed and armed\r\nafter the picturesque fashion of their native country (which extends\r\nacross the whole peninsula of Hindostan) and were led by a Rissaldar,\r\nor commander of independent horse. He had twenty-five pieces of cannon\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHe came in sight of the British on the banks of the Poliar, a broad\r\nand sandy river, the bed of which was quite dry; though in the middle\r\nof October, when the winter usually commences, and the rain descends\r\nin torrents, the river is sometimes half-a-mile broad, and flows\r\ntowards the ocean with the greatest fury. There the adverse hosts\r\nhovered in sight of each other, until after succeeding in destroying\r\nsome magazines which were in Colonel Coote's rear (the loss of which\r\nprevented his troops from acting in the field for some days after),\r\nLally with his 12,000 men suddenly invested Vandivash, against which\r\nhis batteries opened with such effect, that a broad and practicable\r\nbreach was soon made in the outer bastion, and now it was hoped that by\r\none bold assault the captured fortress would be re-won, and with it the\r\nentire disputed territory.\r\n\r\nBut at the very time when Lally was about to lead on the assault, Coote\r\nwith 1700 European and 3000 black troops, fourteen pieces of cannon,\r\nand one howitzer, came suddenly upon his rear to relieve the garrison.\r\n\r\nExposed to the cannon of the fort on one side, and to the troops of\r\nCoote on the other, Lally found himself critically situated; but,\r\nturning like a lion at bay, he drew off from his trenches, and rapidly\r\nformed in order of battle to face this new enemy, on the 21st of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nBoth armies were in high spirits and eager to engage.\r\n\r\nAbout nine in the morning they were two miles apart. Coote having\r\nadvanced with his cavalry and five companies of sepoys, Lally sent\r\nforward his Mahratta horse to meet them; but these, on being galled\r\nby two pieces of cannon, retired with precipitation. During this the\r\ncolonel had succeeded in completely reconnoitring the position of Count\r\nLally, whose forces were ably and judiciously placed, till the British\r\nmade a movement to the right, which obliged him to alter and extend his\r\nleft flank.\r\n\r\nWhile the lines were three-quarters of a mile apart the cannonading\r\nbegan on both sides, and was continued with deadly precision and effect\r\nuntil noon, when Lally sent forward a small party of his European\r\ncavalry to charge the British left. A few companies of sepoys and two\r\nguns sent forward by Coote soon drove these in rear of their own army,\r\nand as the forces still continued approaching, by one o'clock the roar\r\nof musketry became general along both lines from flank to flank, and\r\nthat broad plain on which a cloudless sun was shining became shrouded\r\nin snow-white smoke.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by the cowardice of his cavalry, the hot-blooded Lally now\r\nthrew himself into the line of his infantry, and at the head of the\r\nRegiment of Lorraine fell impetuously upon the British. Colonel Coote\r\nwas on foot and at the head of his own regiment to receive them.\r\n\r\nAfter giving and receiving two discharges of musketry, the Regiment de\r\nLorraine rushed on with a fury that threatened to sweep all before it.\r\nLally was in front, sword in hand; the bayonets crossed--the _British\r\nline was broken_; but though a momentary confusion followed, it was not\r\ndriven back. A series of bloody single combats ensued, with the charged\r\nbayonet and clubbed musket; but these were of brief duration; for in\r\nthree minutes the Regiment of Lorraine was broken in turn, routed, and\r\ndriven back in headlong confusion, over a field strewed with their own\r\nkilled and wounded. The explosion of a tumbril in rear of the French\r\nline created an additional confusion, of which Coote lost not a moment\r\nin taking advantage.\r\n\r\nHe ordered Major Brereton to advance with the regiment of Colonel\r\nDraper (who had returned to Europe for the benefit of his health),\r\nand by wheeling to the right to fall on the French left, and seize a\r\nfortified post which they were on the point of abandoning.\r\n\r\nThis service was performed with the utmost bravery; the French left was\r\nrouted and driven pell-mell upon their centre. Draper's regiment was\r\nthe 79th, not the present _Cameron Highlanders_, but a corps which was\r\ndisbanded in 1763. All had now become confusion among the enemy, but\r\nthe gallant and accomplished Brereton fell mortally wounded.\r\n\r\n\"Follow--follow!\" he exclaimed to some soldiers who loitered near\r\nhim; \"follow and leave me to my fate!\" He soon expired; led by Major\r\nMonsoon, the regiment advanced impetuously on, and after a vain and\r\ndesperate attempt, made by the Chevalier de Bussy, with Lally's\r\nregiment, to repel it, the French and their allies were completely\r\nrouted in every direction by two o'clock in the afternoon. The Regiment\r\nde Lally was almost cut to pieces; the horse of Brigadier-General M. de\r\nBussy was shot under him, and he was taken prisoner by Major Monsoon,\r\nto whom he surrendered his sword.\r\n\r\nLally having brought up his fugitive cavalry, formed them in rear of\r\nhis infantry, and enabled these to make a secure though precipitate\r\nretreat, leaving on the field a thousand men killed and wounded, with\r\nfifty prisoners, including the Marquis de Bussy, Quartermaster-General\r\nle Chevalier de Gadville, Lieutenant-Colonel Murphy, three captains,\r\nfive lieutenants, many other officers, and twenty-two pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nCoote lost 260 killed and wounded. Among the former was the gallant\r\nBrereton. Maréchal Charles Grant, Vicomte de Vaux, affirms that the\r\nlosses were equal on both sides.\r\n\r\nCovering the foot by the cavalry, Lally conducted his routed forces\r\nwith considerable skill and good order to Pondicherry, while Coote\r\nlost not a moment in pursuing the advantage he had gained. Dispatching\r\nthe Baron Vasserot towards that place with 1000 horse and 300 sepoys,\r\nand with orders to ravage and lay waste all the French territory in\r\nand around it, he advanced in person against Chittipett, a small town\r\nand fort in the Carnatic, which, after a defence of two days, was\r\nsurrendered on the 29th January, 1760, by the Chevalier de Tillie, who\r\nwith his garrison remained prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd February he reduced the fort of Timmary on the Coromandel\r\ncoast, and pushing on to Arcot, the capital, opened his batteries and\r\ndug his approaches within sixty yards of the glacis. The garrison,\r\nwhich consisted of 250 French with 300 sepoys, defended the place until\r\nthe 10th, when they surrendered as prisoners of war, delivering up\r\ntwenty-two pieces of cannon and a large store of warlike munition.\r\n\r\nThus the campaign ended gloriously for Britain by the conquest of\r\nArcot, and by hemming up the indefatigable but most unfortunate Lally\r\nin the fortifications of Pondicherry, the capital of French India,\r\nwhich was soon fated to become the last scene of his valour and\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nSurat, a place of great consequence on the coast of Malabar, was taken\r\nby a Bombay detachment, which destroyed the French factory. The English\r\nhad obtained a settlement there from King Jehan Jeer in the year 1020\r\nof the Hijerah. By sea the operations had been carried on with equal\r\nvigour. On the 4th September, 1759, an engagement had taken place\r\nbetween the fleets of Count d'Aché and Admiral Pocock, who obliged the\r\nformer to sheer off with great loss. In April, the fortress of Karical\r\nhad fallen, and by that time Admirals Pocock and Cornish had united\r\ntheir fleets in the roads of Pondicherry, within the gates of which\r\nnearly all that remained of the French forces in India were shut up, or\r\nencamped four leagues in front of it, under the command of the Count de\r\nLally, barring the way by which he knew the British would march to an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIn Karical 174 pieces of cannon were taken, and to add to the disasters\r\nof the French, one of their 64-gun ships (the _Haerlem_) was burned in\r\nthe roads of Pondicherry by the British cruisers.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his long career of success, and by the pecuniary and\r\npolitical embarrassments of his enemy, Colonel Coote resolved on\r\ninvesting Pondicherry. The approach of the rainy season, together with\r\nthe well-known reputation for skill, bravery, and resolution enjoyed\r\nby the general of the now almost ruined French India Company, caused\r\na regular siege to be considered impracticable; \"it was therefore\r\ndetermined,\" says the Sieur Charles Grant, \"to block up the place by\r\nsea and land.\"\r\n\r\nLally had only 1500 Frenchmen with him; these were the remnants of\r\nnine different corps of the King's and India Company's Service; the\r\ncavalry, artillery, and invalids of the latter; the Creole volunteers\r\nof the Isle de Bourbon; the king's artillery; the Regiments of Lally,\r\nLorraine, Mazinis, and the battalion of India.\r\n\r\nThe British armaments on the coast were now much more considerable. On\r\nthe land were four battalions of the line, and by sea were seventeen\r\nsail of the line, carrying 1038 pieces of cannon, the smallest being\r\nthree 50-gun ships.\r\n\r\nAs the fortress of Pondicherry was as impregnable as nature and art\r\ncould make it, Coote was perfectly aware that it could only be reduced\r\nby the most severe famine. It was also his opinion that with such an\r\nantagonist as Arthur Lally, a formal siege with regular approaches\r\nwould prove perfectly futile with any force he could assemble; for,\r\nin addition to his French comrades, Lally had a strong force of armed\r\nsepoys, and a vast store of warlike munition, including nearly 700\r\npieces of cannon, and many millions of ball cartridges, all made up\r\nfor service. The ramparts bore 508 pieces (independent of mortars),\r\nthe walls were five miles in circumference, and had a deep broad moat\r\nbefore them. There were six gates and thirteen bastions. The cavalry\r\nof the French India Company openly deserted in great numbers, and were\r\nreceived with rewards by Colonel Coote. This exasperated Lally so much,\r\nthat he erected gibbets all round Pondicherry in order to deter others\r\nfrom leaving the town or the lines before it.\r\n\r\nTo victual the place completely for the inhabitants and his garrison\r\nwas the first care of Lally; for the town was large, and possessed an\r\noverplus of population, which gave him infinite cause for trouble and\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nPondicherry was surrounded by a number of forts, the defence of which,\r\nin all former sieges, had occasioned the inhabitants the utmost\r\ndifficulty; but these were rapidly reduced, as all the adjacent country\r\nwas in the hands of the British. The fleet of Sir Samuel Cornish came\r\nto anchor on the 17th March, and while Coote approached nearer by land,\r\nLally, in order to retard him, retired from position to position,\r\nbravely disputing every inch of ground, until, in front of Pondicherry,\r\nhe formed his famous lines, which he defended for three months with\r\nadmirable skill and valour, thereby gaining sufficient time to have\r\nvictualled the town for the half of a year. While thus holding the foe\r\nin check, he concluded a treaty with the Rajah of Mysore, who pledged\r\nhimself to supply Pondicherry with provisions; but failed to perform\r\nhis promise, and departed with his people. A short time afterwards,\r\nLally resolved to attempt a _sortie_, and on the night of the 2nd\r\nSeptember, 1760, he made a furious attack on Coote's advanced posts,\r\nbut was repulsed with great loss, and had seventeen pieces of cannon\r\ntaken. Coote lost but a few privates.\r\n\r\nThe last of the fortified boundary, or chain of redoubts, was carried\r\nby storm on the 10th September; the French were driven in, and Coote\r\nhad forty killed and seventy wounded; Major Monsoon had one of his legs\r\ntorn off by a cannon-shot.\r\n\r\nA body of Scottish Highlanders, who had just been landed from the\r\n_Sandwich_ East Indiaman, behaved with their accustomed valour in\r\nthis affair. Passing Draper's grenadiers in their eagerness to get at\r\nthe enemy, they threw down their muskets, and with their bonnets in\r\none hand, and their claymores in the other, hewed a passage through a\r\njungle hedge, fell with a wild cheer upon the soldiers of Lally, and\r\ncut a whole company to pieces. Only five Highlanders and two grenadiers\r\nwere shot. The Highlanders were fifty in number, and were commanded by\r\na Captain Morrison. They belonged to the 89th Highland Regiment, which\r\nhad been raised among the Gordon clan in the preceding year.\r\n\r\nAfter that night, the operations of Lally were confined to the walls of\r\nPondicherry.\r\n\r\nOf the guns taken by the Highlanders, seven were found to be\r\n18-pounders, loaded to the muzzle with square bars of iron six inches\r\nlong, jagged pieces of metal, stones and bottles. They were on Lally's\r\nstrongest battery, which was formed before a thick wood, one mile in\r\nfront of Pondicherry, which could no longer have any succour from the\r\nseaward, as the Chef d'Escadre had sailed for Brest, where he arrived\r\nin April, 1761. Thus a 54-gun ship, a 36-gun frigate, and four Indiamen\r\nwere left behind, and hopelessly shut up in the roadstead.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, Admiral Stevens, who had relieved Admiral\r\nCornish, sailed with his portion of the fleet for Trincomalee to refit,\r\nleaving five sail of the line, under Captain Haldane, to blockade\r\nPondicherry, while Colonel Coote pressed on the investment by land.\r\nBy their dispositions and vigilance, the dense population became\r\ndistressed for provisions even before a siege was formally begun, and\r\nwhile the incessant rains rendered a closer conflict impracticable. The\r\nblockade was supported by a number of batteries judiciously posted;\r\nby these the garrison was harassed on one hand, while their supplies\r\nwere cut off on the other; and these posts were gradually pushed nearer\r\nand nearer to the town, notwithstanding the deluge of rain, which had\r\nswollen the broad currents of the Chonenbar and the Gingi, two rivers\r\nthat unite near it, and roll their tides together to the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th November, the rains abated, and Colonel Coote directed his\r\nengineers to erect batteries in other places; from whence, without\r\nbeing exposed, they could enfilade the works of the garrison, which was\r\nstrictly closed in, and by the failure of the Mysorean rajah to fulfil\r\nhis promise, was now enduring the utmost privations from scarcity of\r\nfood. Lally was compelled to turn out of the town a vast multitude of\r\nnative women and children; but Coote drove them back again, and, as\r\nthe batteries were firing at the time, a great number of these poor\r\nwretches were slain or severely wounded.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations, Captain Sir Charles Chalmers of Cults, a\r\ngallant Scottish baronet who served in Coote's artillery, died of\r\nfatigue. He possessed only the honours of his family, their estates\r\nhaving been forfeited for adherence to the house of Stuart about\r\nfifteen years before.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 7th October, the armed boats of the British fleet\r\nwere pulled with muffled oars into the harbour, and two ships were\r\ncut out, under the very muzzles of Lally's cannon; but not before he\r\nhad killed and wounded thirty officers and men. The prizes were the\r\n_Balcine_ and _Hermione_, a frigate and a valuable Indiaman. In this\r\naffair Lieutenant Owen, of H.B.M. ship _Sunderland_, lost an arm.\r\n\r\nTo encourage the British, the Nabob of Arcot promised to divide among\r\nthem fifty lacs of rupees on the day Pondicherry should surrender, and,\r\nas each lac was valued at 12,600_l._ sterling, the greatest enthusiasm\r\nprevailed among the officers, soldiers, and seamen: moreover, as all\r\nthe French colonists who fled from other places had stored up their\r\neffects in Pondicherry, the treasure there was reputed to be enormous.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th September, Coote's forces had been mustered at 3500 English\r\nand Scottish Highlanders, with 7000 sepoys, all of whom were strongly\r\nintrenched, having taken Arcupong, Villa Nova, and every French\r\noutpost, while fifteen sail of the line and three frigates swept the\r\nocean to the seaward, cutting of all succour; indeed, none was ever\r\nafforded to the unfortunate Lally save by the Dutch settlers, who sent\r\ntwo unpretending boats; but even these were observed, and on being\r\nseized were found to contain 20,000_l._ in cash and many valuable\r\nstores. Every day provisions were becoming more and more scarce, and\r\nnotwithstanding the weakness of his garrison, Lally was compelled to\r\nselect 200 French and 300 black soldiers, whom he contrived to despatch\r\ntowards Gingi for succour; but they were all cut off, and thus he found\r\nhimself worse than before.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity increased, and now gaunt starvation and death met the eye\r\non every hand; a thousand scenes of horror and distress occurred daily\r\nwithin the walls of Pondicherry. The soldiers of Lally and the citizens\r\nwere compelled to eat the flesh of elephants, camels, and troop-horses;\r\nafter which dogs, cats, and even rats were devoured. The count was\r\nfrequently implored to surrender, but having now become sullen,\r\nrevengeful, and determined, his lofty pride made him resolve to perish\r\namong the ruins of the French Indian capital, but never _capitulate_.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four rupees were given for a small dog, and in some instances as\r\nmany half-crowns.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th November, Lally dispatched a 54-gun ship, _La Compagnie des\r\nIndes_, to Trincomalee, a Danish settlement, for provisions; but after\r\neluding the watchful blockading fleet, she was taken at sea by H.M.\r\nships _Medway_ and _Newcastle_, and with her loss all hopes of succour\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th November, Colonel Coote erected a _ricochet_ battery\r\nfor four pieces of cannon, at 1400 yards from the glacis (for the\r\ninformation of unmilitary readers, we may mention that _ricochet\r\nfiring_ means when cannon or mortars are loaded with small charges,\r\nelevated from five to twelve degrees, so that when discharged from the\r\nparapet, the shot may _roll_ along the opposite rampart); this was more\r\nwith a view to harass the French than damage their works; but meanwhile\r\nfour other batteries were erecting in different places to rake and\r\nbatter them.\r\n\r\nOne for four guns, called _the Prince of Wales Battery_, was formed\r\nnear the sea-beach, on the north, to enfilade the great street which\r\nintersects the White Town.\r\n\r\nA second, for four guns and two mortars, was formed to enfilade the\r\ncounter-guard, before the north-west bastion, at a thousand yards'\r\ndistance, and in honour of the \"Butcher of Culloden,\" was called the\r\n_Duke of Cumberland's Battery_.\r\n\r\nA third, called _Prince Edward's_, for two guns, faced the southern\r\nworks at 1200 yards' distance, to enfilade the streets from south to\r\nnorth, and cross the fire of the northern battery.\r\n\r\nA fourth, on the south-west, at 1100 yards' distance, and called\r\n_Prince William's Battery_, was mounted with two guns and one mortar,\r\nto destroy the cannon on the redoubt of San Thomé.\r\n\r\nLally beheld all these preparations with calmness, and by inspiring his\r\nsoldiers with something of his own fierce ardour, laboured to retard\r\nthe work of the besiegers, whose batteries commenced a simultaneous\r\nfire at midnight on the 8th December. Lally's cannoniers replied with\r\nthe utmost vigour; they slew a master gunner, a subahdar of sepoys, and\r\nwounded a great many more.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, a violent tempest of wind, accompanied by\r\ntorrents of rain, had almost ruined the works of Coote, and blown\r\nthe fleet off the coast. The French became elated by the delay this\r\noccasioned, and the consequent prospect of relief; but the sudden\r\nreappearance of Admiral Stevens with his vessels caused their hopes\r\nto fade away; and once more this little band of starving and desperate\r\nmen betook them to their muskets and lintstocks; for, still pressing\r\non, Coote, on the 29th, formed a fifth battery, called _the Hanover_,\r\nat only 450 yards' distance, for ten cannon and three mortars, which\r\nopened a fire of shot and shell against the counter-guard and curtain.\r\n\r\nAt last, being driven frantic by their sufferings, the soldiers and\r\ncitizens demanded that the place should be surrendered. Lally was\r\nimmovable, but yet feeling keenly for what they endured, dissatisfied\r\nwith the state of the French Indian affairs, and greatly exasperated\r\nby the disorderly conduct of his troops, and the baseness of their\r\ncommissaries, he frequently burst into passionate exclamations which\r\nshowed the keenness of his agitation.\r\n\r\n\"Hell has spewed me into this country of wickedness,\" he said on one\r\noccasion, \"and like Jonas I wait until the whale shall receive me into\r\nits belly!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go among the Caffres, rather than remain longer in this Sodom,\"\r\nhe exclaimed on another occasion.\r\n\r\nBut, nevertheless, he still defended the town like a good soldier, and\r\non the disappearance of the British fleet during the storm, wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to M. de Raymond, the Resident at Pullicot:--\r\n\r\n \"M. Raymond, the English squadron is no more! Out of twelve ships\r\n they had in our roads seven are lost, crews and all; four others are\r\n dismasted, and it appears that only one frigate has escaped, therefore\r\n lose not an instant to send us chelingoes upon chelingoes loaded with\r\n rice. The Dutch have nothing to fear now; besides--according to the\r\n law of nations--they are only to send us no provisions _themselves_,\r\n and we are no longer blocked up by sea.\r\n\r\n \"The saving of Pondicherry has once already been in your power. If you\r\n miss the present, it will be entirely your own fault. Don't forget\r\n some small chelingoes--offer great rewards. I expect 17,000 Mahrattas\r\n in four days; in short, risk all! attempt! force all! but send us\r\n some rice, should it be but a half garse at a time.\r\n\r\n \"Lally.\r\n\r\n \"Pondicherry, 2nd January, 1761.\"\r\n\r\nThe British fleet suffered considerably; many vessels which had to\r\ncut their cables, were totally dismasted, and the _Queensberry_,\r\n_Newcastle_, and _Protector_ were driven on shore; while _Le Duc\r\nd'Acquitaine_ of sixty-four guns (French prize), commanded by Sir\r\nWilliam Hewitt, Bart., and the _Sunderland_ of sixty guns, commanded\r\nby the Hon. James Colville, both foundered, and all on board perished.\r\nCaptain Colville was the son of Lord Colville, of Culross, a Scottish\r\npeer, who died on the Carthagena expedition in 1740, and brother of\r\nAlexander Lord Colville, who in 1764 was Commodore in North America.\r\n\r\nOn the reappearance of Admiral Cornish with more of the fleet, the hope\r\nof the French sank again, and Lally, enraged at what he considered\r\nthe mutinous repining of his soldiers, met their remonstrances with\r\nturbulence and contempt, and by an unwise, and perhaps over-strained\r\nexercise of authority, at this fatal and desperate crisis, most\r\nunfortunately contrived to render himself unpopular with the Governor,\r\nthe Council, and the proud chevaliers of old France, who officered his\r\nlittle band of troops.\r\n\r\nStill, however, the siege was pressed, and still the defence went on.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th January, Coote attacked the redoubt of San Thomé, sword\r\nin hand, at the head of a body of Scottish Highlanders and English\r\ngrenadiers, and won it, thus silencing four 28-pounders; but two days\r\nafterwards, Lally retook it by 300 grenadiers, from the sepoys who were\r\nleft in charge of it.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Coote sent 700 Europeans, 400 Lascars, and a company\r\nof pioneers under a major, to erect another battery of eleven guns\r\nand three mortars. Under the clear splendour of an Oriental moon,\r\nthese works were carried on within 500 yards of the walls; and this\r\n_Batterie Royale_ was permitted to be erected without molestation,\r\nfor in their sullen despair the garrison never fired a shot at it. On\r\nthe 14th the _Hanover Battery_ ruined the north-west bastion, and on\r\nthe following day the _Batterie Royale_ beat down the ravelin at the\r\nMadras gate; thus by the 15th of January a great and practicable breach\r\nwas effected, and the cannon of the gallant Lally were silenced or\r\ndismounted.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a parley was beat, and four envoys came from the ruined\r\nwalls towards the British trenches. These were Colonel Duré (Durie?) of\r\nthe French Royal Artillery, Father Lavacer, Superior of the Jesuits,\r\nand two civilians. These were unprovided by \"any authority from the\r\nGovernor,\" says Vicomte de Vaux; but Colonel Coote, in his dispatch to\r\nMr. Pitt, affirms that they came direct from Lally with proposals for\r\ndelivering up the garrison. In the town, at that moment, there were\r\nonly three days provisions of the wretched kind described; thus the\r\nextremity of famine would admit of no hesitation. Rendered ungovernable\r\nby what they had endured, Lally's officers declared the defence to be\r\nfrantic obstinacy, and murmuring aloud, also averred that illness,\r\npride, and the climate had disordered his imagination; and that it was\r\ncriminal rather than valiant to defend an untenable fortress.\r\n\r\nThe following were the proposals of Lally, presented by Colonel Duré to\r\nColonel Coote:--\r\n\r\n \"The troops of the king and Company, by want of provisions, will\r\n surrender themselves prisoners of war to his Britannic Majesty, on\r\n terms of the cartel, which I claim equally for all the inhabitants of\r\n Pondicherry, as well as for the exercise of the Roman religion, the\r\n religious houses, hospitals, chaplains, surgeons, serjeants, reserving\r\n and referring myself to the decision of our two Courts, in proportion\r\n to the violation of a treaty so solemn. (He refers to the treacherous\r\n capture of Chandernagore.)\r\n\r\n \"Accordingly M. Coote may take possession of the Villenour Gate at\r\n eight o'clock to-morrow morning; and after to-morrow, at the same\r\n hour, that of Fort St. Lewis.\r\n\r\n \"I demand, merely from a principle of justice and humanity, that the\r\n mother and sisters of Raza Sahib may be permitted to seek an asylum\r\n where they please, or that they remain prisoners among the English,\r\n and not be delivered into the hands of Mohammed Ali Khan, which are\r\n still red with the blood of the husband and father, which he has\r\n spilt, to the shame of those who gave them up to him; but not less to\r\n the shame of the commander of the English army, who should not have\r\n allowed such a piece of barbarity to be committed in his camp.\r\n\r\n \"As I am tied up by the cartel, in the declaration which I make to\r\n M. Coote, I consent that the Council of Pondicherry may make their\r\n own representations to him with regard to what may concern their own\r\n private interests as well as the interests of the inhabitants of the\r\n colony.\r\n\r\n \"Done at Fort Lewis, Pondicherry, 15th day of January, 1761.\r\n\r\n \"Lally.\"\r\n\r\nTo these the Colonel replied briefly by stating that the capture\r\nof Chandernagore was beyond his cognizance, and had no relation to\r\nPondicherry; that he merely required the soldiers of its garrison to\r\nyield as prisoners of war, promising that they should be treated with\r\nevery honour and humanity; that he would send the grenadiers of his\r\nown regiment to receive possession of the Villenour Gate, and that of\r\nFort St. Lewis; and that according to the kind and humane request of\r\nM. Lally, the mother and sisters of Raza Sahib should be escorted to\r\nMadras, and on no account be permitted to fall into the hands of their\r\nenemy, the Nabob Mohammed Ali Khan.\r\n\r\nTo eight articles proposed by Father Lavacer, Superior of the Jesuits,\r\nrequiring that the inhabitants should be treated in every respect\r\nlike subjects of his Britannic Majesty; that they should have full\r\nliberty to exercise the Catholic religion; that the churches should be\r\nrejected; that all public papers should be sent to France; and that\r\nforty-one soldiers of the Volunteers of Bourbon should be permitted to\r\nreturn to their homes--Colonel Coote declined to make any reply.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th July, Lally with a bitter\r\nheart ordered the standard of France to be hauled down on Fort St.\r\nLewis, and at that hour Coote's grenadiers received the Villenour\r\nGate from the Regiment de Lally, while those of the 79th Regiment\r\ntook possession of the citadel.[2] Thus fell Pondicherry after a\r\nblockade and siege which Lally's skill and valour had protracted under\r\na thousand difficulties for the long period of eight months, against\r\nforces treble in number to those he commanded.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his fallen condition and the severe effects of a long\r\nillness, aggravated by the sultry climate, by bodily sufferings and\r\nanxiety, Lally marched out of the citadel with the air of a conqueror.\r\n\"He is now as proud and haughty as ever,\" says an officer (who beheld\r\nhim) in a letter to a periodical of the time; \"but his great share of\r\nwit, sense, and martial ability are obscured by a savage ferocity, and\r\nan undisguised contempt for every person below the rank of general.\"\r\nThis writer was ignorant of the high qualities of Lally, and the\r\ndifficulties with which he had contended, or he would never have\r\nwritten thus.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"_exact state of the troops of his most Christian\r\nMajesty, under the command of Lieutenant-General Arthur Count de Lally,\r\nwhen he surrendered at discretion on the 16th of January, 1761,_\"\r\nhe marched out with the following--a miserable and famished band,\r\nhollow-eyed and gaunt--the few survivors of the Indian war:--\r\n\r\n Artillery of Louis XV., officers and men             83\r\n The Regiment de Lorraine, ditto                     327\r\n The Regiment de Lally, ditto (of the Irish Brigade) 230\r\n The Regiment of the Marine, ditto                   295\r\n\r\n Artillery of the French India Company   94\r\n Cavalry of ditto                        15\r\n Volunteers of Bourbon                   40\r\n The Battalion d'India                  192\r\n Invalides                              124\r\n\r\nIn all there were only 1400. One of their first acts was to cut their\r\ncommissary to pieces. Among the officers of the king's artillery was\r\nJean Baptiste Louis Romée de l'Isle, the celebrated crystallographer,\r\nwho was then secretary to a corps of engineers. The quantity of\r\nmilitary stores delivered over by Lally to Coote is almost incredible.\r\n\r\nThere were 671 brass and iron cannon and mortars; 438 mortar-beds and\r\ncarriages; 84,041 shot and shell, round, double-headed, and grape;\r\n230,580 lbs. of powder; 538,137 rounds of cartridge for arquebuses,\r\nmuskets, carbines, pistols, and gingals; 910 pairs of pistols; 12,580\r\nother firearms; 4895 swords, bayonets and sabres; 1200 poleaxes, and\r\nevery other warlike munition in proportion. Tidings of the fall of\r\nPondicherry occasioned the utmost joy in Britain; and on Sunday, the\r\n2nd August, there were prayers and thanksgiving in all the English\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nOn that day Lally arrived at Fort St. George a prisoner of parole. He\r\nhad begged to be sent to Cudalore that he might have the attendance of\r\nFrench as well as British surgeons; but the Governor of Madras insisted\r\nupon his removal to that place, whither he conveyed him in his own\r\npalanquin.\r\n\r\nA regiment of Highlanders garrisoned Pondicherry, and as Lally had\r\ndestroyed many of the British fortifications, Colonel--afterwards\r\nSir Eyre--Coote retaliated by blowing up the works and hurling the\r\nglacis into the ditch. The plunder acquired amounted to 2,000,000_l._\r\nsterling. The quantity of lead discovered in the stores was immense.\r\nLally found means to convey his own cash and Valuables (200,000 pagodas\r\nof eight shillings each) out of the garrison, but he was deprived of it\r\nby Coote's orders.\r\n\r\nThe plunder of the magnificent palace was a subject for regret to the\r\nofficers who beheld it. It had been built by M. Dupleix, a former\r\nresident, at the cost of one million. On the same day that Lally\r\nsurrendered, his Scottish compatriot, M. Law, on whose assistance he\r\nhad for a time mainly relied, was defeated by Major Carnac.\r\n\r\nM. Law was a nephew of the famous financial projector, John Law, of\r\nLauriston, near Edinburgh, who, in 1720, was Premier of France, and\r\nComptroller-General of Finance--the same whose desperate schemes\r\nbrought the kingdom to the verge of bankruptcy. M. Law had made himself\r\nuseful to the Schah Zaddah, son of the late Mogul, in supporting the\r\nyoung prince's hereditary claims, and enforcing his authority on the\r\nprovinces of the empire. With 200 Frenchmen (principally fugitives\r\nfrom Lally's outposts) he persuaded the schah to turn his arms against\r\nBengal; and accordingly the young and rash prince entered that rich and\r\nfertile province at the head of 80,000 Indians, whose operations were\r\ndirected by Law, and certain chevaliers his friends. In the eye of the\r\nBritish (who had then become the arbiters of Oriental thrones), the\r\npresence of the Scottish refugee and his followers was more prejudicial\r\nto the title of Zaddah than any other objection, and they joined the\r\nSubah of Bengal to oppose his progress. A battle ensued at Guya, when\r\nMajor Carnac, with 500 British, 2500 sepoys, and 20,000 blacks, cut the\r\nvast force of the young prince to pieces, and took prisoner M. Law,\r\nwith sixty French officers.\r\n\r\nSoon after the fall of Pondicherry, the French settlement of Mahé,\r\non the coast of Malabar, was reduced by Major Hector Munro, of the\r\n89th Highlanders, who captured there 200 pieces of cannon, and thus\r\nthe whole commerce of the mighty peninsula of India, from the point\r\nof the Carnatic to the banks of the Ganges, fell under the dominion\r\nof Britain, together with the extensive trade of the vast and wealthy\r\nprovinces of Bengal, Behar, and Orixa.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd February, the nabob made his triumphal entry into\r\nPondicherry, seated in a wooden castle on the back of a gigantic\r\nelephant, accompanied by twelve of his wives, escorted by British\r\ntroops and by his own guards armed with lances, bows, and matchlocks.\r\n\r\nUltimately Lally received back his property, to the amount of\r\n100,000_l._ in cash, and being brought to Britain a prisoner of war\r\nin H.M.S. _Onslow_, landed in September, 1761. He was confined for a\r\ntime to a certain limit in Nottinghamshire; and on obtaining leave of\r\nGeorge III. to depart, most unfortunately for himself, turned his steps\r\ntowards France, the land of his father's adoption.\r\n\r\nHaving given his parole of honour to return whenever the British\r\nGovernment should require his presence, the count, on the 14th October,\r\n\"after having discharged all his debts to tradesmen and servants\" (as\r\nthe London papers of the time state), sailed for France.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the long and gallant defence he had maintained at\r\nPondicherry, thus affording the highest proofs of firmness and\r\nfidelity, bravery and activity, he was arrested soon after his return,\r\nand committed to that prison of so many terrible memories--the\r\nBastille--accused of many grievous things by the Government, which\r\nnow instituted a severe inquiry into the conduct of the civil and\r\nmilitary officials who had commanded in Canada, the Carnatic, and other\r\npossessions taken by Britain.\r\n\r\nAmong the charges brought against Lally were, betraying the interests\r\nof King Louis and of the French East India Company; abusing the high\r\nauthority with which he had been invested; unwarrantable exactions\r\nfrom the subjects of his most Christian Majesty, and from foreigners\r\nresident in Pondicherry; for _permitting_ that place to fall into the\r\nhands of the British; and generally for mismanaging the public affairs\r\ncommitted to his care.\r\n\r\nIn vain did this brave and unfortunate officer urge his many services,\r\nhis many wounds, his grey hairs, his health broken by toil, by anxiety,\r\nand by a torrid clime, in the cause of France. In vain did he urge\r\nthe numerous remonstrances he had sent to Paris, and Count d'Aché's\r\ndetention of M. de Lequille's military chest; that at Madras he had\r\nresigned a desperate command, which the Chevalier des Soupirs declined\r\nto accept; in vain was the _protest_ signed in the hall of Fort St.\r\nLewis adduced to show how his efforts had been baffled, and rendered\r\nmore than futile, by the insubordination of Count d'Aché; in vain did\r\nhe explain how the Marquis de Bussy had loitered in Arcot; that he had\r\nlong and frequently been without pay and without provision for his\r\ntroops; how the Rajah of Mysore had failed in his promises; how his\r\nsoldiers had deserted, and how famine in the streets of Pondicherry\r\nwas a source of deadlier fear than the British cannon-shot; how his\r\ndetachment sent to Gingi had been cut off to a man; how Chandernagore\r\nhad been taken by treachery, contrary to the faith of treaties and\r\nthat neutrality which had subsisted between the French and British\r\nin India, and immediately after the former had rendered the latter a\r\nsignal service in not taking part with the Nabob of Bengal. The weak\r\nGovernment of Louis XV. required a victim to satisfy the people; thus\r\nhis defence was useless. Brigadier-General the Marquis de Bussy and\r\nAdmiral Count d'Aché, whose honour and safety were chiefly interested\r\nin his condemnation, were the principal witnesses examined against\r\nhim. He was detained for four years in a close prison, and, according\r\nto the cruel and barbarous laws then existing in France, \"the bequest\r\nof ages of violence and anarchy,\" was _repeatedly tortured_. Though\r\nhis infamous judges were convinced of his perfect innocence, yet it\r\nwas stated that, in consequence of the severe conclusions of the\r\nProcureur-General against the Count de Lally, on the night of Sunday,\r\nthe 4th May, 1763, he was removed from the Bastille to the prison of\r\nthe Conciergerie, which adjoined the Court of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Though it was but one o'clock in the morning when he arrived at the\r\nConciergerie (to quote the report of his condemnation), he refused to\r\ngo to bed; and about seven he appeared before his judges. They ordered\r\nhim to be divested of his red riband and cross, to which he submitted\r\nwith the most perfect indifference; and he was then placed on the stool\r\nto undergo a new course of interrogation.\"\r\n\r\nAt that crisis a pang of bitterness shot through his heart; clasping\r\nhis hands, and raising his eyes--\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he exclaimed; \"oh, my God! is _this the reward_ of forty\r\nyears faithful service as a soldier?\"\r\n\r\nThe interrogatory lasted six hours, and D'Aché and De Bussy were\r\nsuccessively examined against him. By nine in the evening the\r\nexamination was over, and the count was re-conducted to the Bastille,\r\nsurrounded by guards and several companies of the watch of Paris.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock next morning the judges delivered their opinions, which\r\nwere so various, that the clock of the Conciergerie struck four in the\r\nafternoon before they came to a conclusion and pronounced their _arrêt_\r\nor decree, which contained a brief recital of the charges against De\r\nLally, without specifying the facts on which they were respectively\r\nfounded; but for the reparation of which it was declared that he should\r\nbe stripped of all his civil titles, his military rank, and dignities;\r\nthat all his property should be confiscated to the king; and that his\r\nhead should be struck from his body on the public scaffold.\r\n\r\nWithout emotion the count had heard their sentence, and with the utmost\r\nresolution prepared to die; yet he was detained, hovering as it were\r\nbetween life and death, until the morning of the 9th May, 1766, when\r\nhe was drawn on a hurdle to the _Place de Grève_, and hastily, almost\r\nprivately, beheaded, with his mouth filled by a wooden gag, to prevent\r\nhim addressing the people--thus adding another to the many barbarous\r\njudicial murders which disgrace the annals of France.\r\n\r\nHis son, Trophine Gerard, who had been kept at the College of Harcourt\r\nin entire ignorance of his birth and of the proceedings against his\r\nfather, only learned all these secrets when the public interest and\r\ncommiseration became too great to conceal them longer. On the 9th the\r\npoor boy learned that the great General Lally, who was to die, _was\r\nhis father_. He rushed, as he tells us, to the place of execution to\r\nbid this father, so recently found, \"an eternal adieu--to let him hear\r\nthe voice of a son amid the voices of his executioners, and embrace\r\nhim on the scaffold when he was about to perish;\" but he arrived only\r\nin time to see the axe descending and his father's blood pouring from\r\na dismembered trunk upon a sanded scaffold. Overcome with horror,\r\nTrophine--afterwards the great Count Lally Tollendal--swooned in the\r\nstreet, and was borne away insensible to the College of Harcourt.\r\n\r\nThus in his sixty-fourth year terminated the eventful career of Count\r\nLally, the victim surrendered by a weak and tyrannical ministry to\r\npopular clamour, affording by his fate a memorable instance of the\r\ninjustice, ingratitude, and barbarity of the Court of Versailles.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The MS. original of these interesting instructions was\r\npresented to Charles Grant, Viscount de Vaux, by the directors of the\r\nEnglish East India Company.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The 79th, or Draper's Regiment, lost in this siege, and\r\nencounters before it, thirty-four officers, whose names were inscribed\r\non a beautiful cenotaph, erected on Clifton Downs by Colonel Sir W.\r\nDrapes and which he dedicated as,\r\n\r\n  \"Sacred to the Memory of those departed Warriors,\r\n          Of the Seventy-ninth Regiment,\r\n  By whose Valour, Discipline, and Perseverance\r\n The French land Forces in Asia were first withstood and repulsed.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN CAMERON, OF FASSIFERN,\r\n\r\nK.T.S.,\r\n\r\nCOLONEL OF THE GORDON HIGHLANDERS; SLAIN AT QUATRE-BRAS, 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom among the many distinguished Scottish officers who served under\r\nWellington, if we could select one for the delineation of his career,\r\nit would be John Cameron of the House of Fassifern and Locheil.\r\n\r\nThis brave soldier was the eldest of the seven children of Ewen\r\nCameron, Laird of Fassifern (_i.e._ the Point of Alders), and his wife,\r\nLucy Campbell, of Barcaldine, whose father succeeded to the estate of\r\nGlenure on the death of her uncle, Colin Campbell, who was shot at the\r\nFerry of Ballachulish, in Appin, by Allan Breac Stewart, otherwise\r\nknown as _Vic Ian_, _Vic Alaster_,--a crime for which the Laird of\r\nArdsheil was judicially murdered by the Duke of Argyle at the Castle of\r\nInverary.\r\n\r\nEwen Cameron was the son of John _the Tanister_, a younger brother of\r\nthe great Locheil, who commenced the insurrection of 1745; and it is\r\nsaid that this powerful chief, on being summoned by Prince Charles\r\nto attend his memorable lauding in Moidart on the 25th July, was\r\npredisposed to warn him against the projected rising of the clans.\r\n\r\n\"If such be your intention, Donald,\" said John of Fassifern, \"_write_\r\nyour opinion to the Prince, but do not trust yourself within the\r\nfascination of his presence. I know you better than you know yourself,\r\nand foresee that you will be unable to refuse compliance.\"\r\n\r\nBut Locheil preferred an interview with the Prince, and the event\r\nproved the truth of Fassifern's prophecy. He joined him immediately\r\nwith all the clan Cameron, and the gallant revolt of the clans\r\nimmediately followed. Fassifern was taken prisoner after Culloden,\r\nand was long detained in the Castle of Edinburgh; there he was kept\r\nso close that the year 1752 arrived, yet he heard nothing of the\r\nbarbarous execution of his brother, the amiable and unfortunate Dr.\r\nArchibald Cameron, until one evening a soldier brought him a kettle\r\nwith hot water. He took off a paper which was twisted round the handle,\r\nand found it to be the \"last speech and dying confession, &c., of\r\nthe traitor Archibald Cameron.\" He immediately ordered a suit of the\r\ndeepest mourning, and on appearing in it before the authorities was\r\nbrutally upbraided by the Lord Justice Clerk for putting on mourning\r\nfor a traitor.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said Cameron, \"that traitor was my dear brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"A rebel!\" retorted the judge, scornfully. He was exiled, but\r\nafterwards returned to die at Fassifern.\r\n\r\nColonel John Cameron, the grand-nephew of the Jacobite chief, was born\r\nin Argyleshire, at the farm of Inverscaddle (a house which belonged to\r\nhis family before the acquisition of Fassifern), on the 16th of August,\r\n1771, only twenty-five years after the battle of Culloden, and while\r\nthose inhuman butcheries, for which the name of Cumberland is still\r\nabhorred in Scotland, were fresh in the memory of the people. According\r\nto the old custom, common to Scotland and Ireland, he was assigned to\r\nthe care of a foster-mother named M'Millan, who dwelt in Glendescherie,\r\non the shore of Locharkaig. Thus, born and bred among the Gael, while\r\nthe clans were unchanged and uncorrupted, and when the glens were\r\nfull of that gallant race, with all their old traditions and historic\r\nmemories, their military pride, and peculiar prejudices, Cameron was\r\nreared as thorough a chieftain as if had lived in the days of James IV.\r\nEducated among his native mountains, sharing in the athletic sports of\r\nthe people, and those in which his foster-brother, Ewan M'Millan, who\r\nwas a fox-hunter in Croydart, and a year his elder, excelled, young\r\nCameron grew up a handsome and hardy Highlander, and early became\r\ndistinguished by that proud, fiery, and courageous temperament for\r\nwhich he was so well known among the troops of Lord Hill's division,\r\nand which sometimes caused him to set the rules of discipline, and\r\nthe aristocratic coldness of Wellington, alike at defiance, if they\r\ninterfered with his native ideas of rank and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Romance of War,\" a work which has made his name familiar to the\r\nreading public, a faithful description of him will be found. He was\r\nabove the middle height, had a pleasing, open countenance, curly brown\r\nhair, and bright blue eyes, which, when he was excited, filled with a\r\ndusky fire.\r\n\r\nArms were then the only occupation for a Highland gentleman; and thus\r\nin his twenty-second year, on the 8th of February, 1793, he obtained an\r\nensigncy in the 26th, or Cameronian Regiment, commanded by Sir William\r\nErskine. He never joined that corps; but on raising a sufficient number\r\nof men in Locheil, procured a lieutenantcy in an independent Highland\r\ncompany then being formed by Capt. A. Campbell, of Ardchattan. He was\r\ngazetted on the 3rd of April; but this company was either disbanded\r\nor incorporated with the old 93rd Regiment, to which he was appointed\r\nlieutenant on the 30th of October in the same year. He did not join\r\nthis regiment either, but busied himself in raising a company to\r\nprocure the rank of captain in a corps of Highlanders, which, in\r\nobedience to a _letter of service_, dated 10th February, 1794, the Duke\r\nof Gordon was raising for his son, the young Marquis of Huntly, then\r\na captain in the Scottish Regiment of Guards. This battalion was to\r\nconsist of 46 officers, 64 staff, and 1000 rank and file, to be raised\r\namong the clan of Gordon.\r\n\r\nFrom the lands of Fassifern and Locheil Cameron drew a company,\r\nprincipally of his own name and kindred, all hardy and handsome young\r\nHighlanders, among whom were his foster-brother, Ewen M'Millan, who\r\nnever left him; three Camerons, Ewen, Alaster, and Angus, whom he made\r\nsergeants; Ewen Kennedy, for whom he procured an ensigncy, and another,\r\nwho died a lieutenant. With these, all clad in their native tartans, he\r\nmarched from the Braes of Lochaber to Castle Gordon, in Strathspey,\r\nwhere he was introduced to Alexander, Duke of Gordon, the _Cock o' the\r\nNorth_, by his uncle, the Rev. Dr. Ross, of Kilmanivaig, the worthy\r\nauthor of the statistical account of that parish. He at once received\r\na company in the duke's own regiment, to which he was appointed on the\r\n13th of February, 1794, and with which he attended the grand muster of\r\nthe whole at Aberdeen on the 24th of June, when the corps was named the\r\n_Gordon Highlanders_, or 100th Regiment, afterwards and now the 92nd.\r\nThe uniform coats and vests were scarlet, faced with yellow, and laced\r\nwith silver to suit the epaulettes. The kilts and plaids were in one\r\npiece, each containing twelve yards of Gordon tartan; the claymores,\r\ndirks, buckles, and sporrans were mounted with silver; the bonnets\r\nwere plumed with black ostrich feathers, and encircled by the old fess\r\nchecque of the House of Stuart. The men were all Highlanders; scarcely\r\none of them, and but very few of the officers, could speak English; the\r\nenthusiasm was so great in Badenoch that, in some instances, fathers\r\nand sons joined its ranks together.\r\n\r\nAt that time, when the French Revolution menaced Europe with anarchy,\r\nand the Convention declared war against Britain and Holland, the number\r\nof Highlanders in our service is almost incredible. During a period of\r\nfifty years the clans furnished _eighty-six_ battalions of infantry,\r\nsome of which were twelve hundred strong.[3]\r\n\r\nHow many could the Highlands raise now? Centralization, corruption,\r\nand local tyranny of the most infamous description have turned their\r\nbeautiful glens into a silent wilderness, and the very place where\r\nCameron raised his company of soldiers is now desolate and bare. \"I\r\ncan point,\" says the author of a letter to the Marquis of Breadalbane,\r\non his late ruthless _clearings_, \"to a place where thirty recruits\r\nthat manned the 92nd in Egypt came from--men before whom Napoleon's\r\nInvincibles bit the dust--and now only _two_ families reside there\r\ntogether. I was lately informed by a grazier that on his form a hundred\r\nswordsmen could be gathered at their country's call, and now there are\r\nonly himself and _two_ shepherds.\" The brave Gael, who crowded in tens\r\nof thousands to the British ranks, saw not the reward that was coming;\r\nevictions and wholesale clearings of the Scottish poor were then\r\nunknown. God gave the land to the people--they believed it was theirs\r\nbut the feudal charters have decided otherwise, and the clans have\r\nbeen swept from Lochness to Locheil, and from Locheil to the shores of\r\nLochlomond. The hills and the valleys are there, but the tribes have\r\ndeparted, and who can restore them?\r\n\r\nCameron of Fassifern embarked with his regiment at Fort George, in\r\nArdersier, for Southampton, where, as kilted corps were unusual then\r\nin England, its arrival created a great sensation. From thence the\r\nbattalion sailed for Gibraltar, under the command of Huntly, its\r\ncolonel commandant, and disembarked at the Rock on the 27th of October.\r\nIt was on this occasion that Mrs. Grant, of Laggan, composed her now\r\npopular song, \"The Blue Bells of Scotland.\"\r\n\r\nAt Gibraltar a coolness ensued between Cameron and the marquis, and\r\nfrom that hour they never were friends. The former having had a\r\ndispute at the mess with a Captain M'Pherson on some point of Highland\r\netiquette, high words and a duel followed. Captain, afterwards Colonel\r\nMitchel, C.B., and Knight of St. Anne of Russia, was Cameron's second.\r\nHappily nothing serious resulted; and next day at the mess Lord Huntly\r\ndrank wine with them all, begging that in future no more such quarrels\r\nmight occur, and concluded by saying--\r\n\r\n\"I may be pardoned in requiring this, as, I believe, all the gentlemen\r\nhere are the tenants of my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, marquis,\" said Fassifern, loftily; \"by Heaven, here is one who is\r\nno tenant of the house of Gordon.\"\r\n\r\nThe young marquis frowned; he did not reply, but never forgot the\r\nhaughty retort.\r\n\r\nIn sentiments and character, even in manner, Fassifern belonged to\r\na past age--to a period of time beyond our own; for the stern pride,\r\nthe Spartan spirit of clanship, with all the wild associations of the\r\nGael, deeply imbued his mind, and gave a decision to his manner and a\r\nfreshness to his enthusiasm. Proud and fiery, like all his race, he\r\nhad the defect of being quick and hasty in his speech; but he never\r\ncalled aloud the name of an officer on parade, though more than one\r\nwas reprehended by him in terms of severity, which, when the gust of\r\npassion was past, his generous spirit told him had been too great. He\r\nwas a rigid disciplinarian, strict even to a fault, and yet withal he\r\npossessed a charm which won him the affection and respect of all his\r\nregiment. To English officers who did not understand him, to Wellington\r\nin particular, his pride seemed perhaps mere petulance, and his\r\nHighland chivalry (the result of his education) eccentricity: but of\r\nthese more anon.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving its colours on Windmill Hill, the regiment embarked for\r\nCorsica, and on the 11th of July, 1795, landed at Bastia, where, under\r\nthe influence of Paoli, the allies had landed in the preceding year,\r\nand united the birthplace of Bonaparte to the British dominions. After\r\nsuppressing a rebellion in Corte, a town in the centre of the isle, and\r\nforming the secret expedition under their major, Alexander Napier, of\r\nBlackstone, to reduce Porto Ferrajo in Elba, the Highlanders returned\r\nto Gibraltar, where General de Burgh publicly testified his approbation\r\nof their conduct.\r\n\r\nCameron who was now, by the death of Major Donald M'Donald, of\r\nBoisdale, senior captain, accompanied the regiment to Portsmouth, where\r\nit landed in May, and from whence it went to Dublin in June, 1798.\r\nHere he became attached to a young lady possessed of great personal\r\nattractions, and announced to his father his intention of marrying. But\r\nold Ewen Cameron had imbibed some curious prejudices against the Irish,\r\nfor a false rumour had gained credence in the Highlands that Prince\r\nCharles had been betrayed at Culloden by his two Irish followers,\r\nSullivan and Sheridan. There was great consternation in Fassifern and\r\nthe Braes of Lochaber when it was announced that the young laird was\r\nabout to wed a stranger; and however absurd this prejudice may appear,\r\nold Fassifern set all his wits to work, and contrived to have the\r\nengagement broken off completely. A quarrel ensued between the lovers;\r\nrumour speaks of another duel with some one; but from that time to the\r\nhour of his death, Cameron was never known to form another serious\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Irish were in arms; Vinegar Hill was valiantly fought\r\nand lost by them; the Highlanders were kept incessantly on the march,\r\nand their belts were never off. During these operations, when encamped\r\nnear Moat, they were re-numbered as the 92nd Regiment of the line.\r\n\r\nAfter being quartered in Athlone, on the 15th June, 1799, Cameron\r\nembarked with the regiment for the camp at Barham Downs, where the\r\ntroops destined for the expedition to Holland were assembling under\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercrombie. The Gordon Highlanders were\r\nbrigaded with the 1st Royal Scots, 25th, or Scots Borderers; the 49th\r\nand Cameron Highlanders, under Brigadier Sir John Moore. The troops\r\nsailed from Ramsgate, landed near the Helder, and on that evening the\r\nGordon Highlanders, after having fifteen men drowned, fought bravely\r\nat the battle of the Sandhills. Here they and Cameron first saw the\r\nFrench, for whom he felt an hereditary abhorrence, having been reared\r\nto believe, like every Highlander, that they had trifled, forty years\r\nbefore, with the best interests of Scotland, and betrayed Prince\r\nCharles and the clans to England.\r\n\r\nHe served at the head of his company in all the operations under\r\nthe gallant Moore--during the advance to Oude Sluys, the action\r\nat Crabhenden, where Captain Ramsay of Dalhousie was wounded; the\r\nengagement with General Brune; the attack on Alkmaar; the retreat to\r\nZuype; and the battle of Egmont-op-Zee, where it is probable that his\r\nFrench antipathy received an additional incentive, by the infliction\r\nof a severe wound. In that decisive charge, by which twenty pieces of\r\ncannon were retaken from the enemy, a ball struck one of his knees;\r\nand as he was falling, the arm of the faithful M'Millan was the first\r\nto support him. Here the Marquis of Huntly was wounded in the shoulder;\r\nand neither he nor Cameron ever fully recovered the effect of these\r\nbullets. In this affair the Highlanders had 288 officers and men killed\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\nAmong the latter was the henchman Ewen, who lost an ear. Rendered\r\nfurious by the wound, regardless of Cameron's orders, he rushed among\r\nthe French, and drove his bayonet, with a ball at the same moment,\r\nthrough the body of the soldier who had wounded him. Returning to his\r\ncompany, he said in Gaelic, to Cameron--\r\n\r\n\"You see what yonder son of the devil has done to me,\" and pointed to\r\nhis ear, which was dripping with blood.\r\n\r\n\"He served you rightly,\" said Cameron, in the same language; \"why did\r\nyou skirmish so far in front?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Dioul!_\" muttered Ewen; \"he won't take my other ear.\"\r\n\r\nHere Sir John Moore was severely wounded, and Cameron desired two\r\nHighlanders to carry him to the rear. Moore afterwards offered 20_l._\r\nto the soldiers who carried him off. The reward was proffered to the\r\nregiment on parade, and it is a noble trait of it, that _no man_\r\never stepped forward to claim the fee. On being created a K.B., and\r\nrequiring supporters for his arms, Moore addressed the following\r\ninteresting letter to Lieutenant-Colonel Napier, then commanding the\r\nregiment:--\r\n\r\n \"Richmond, 17th Nov. 1804.\r\n\r\n \"MY DEAR NAPIER,--I have been for some days on leave in London,\r\n and received your letters there. I am here with my mother for a\r\n day, and return this night to Sandgate. My reason for troubling you\r\n for a drawing is, that, as a Knight of the Bath, I am entitled to\r\n supporters. I have chosen a light-infantry soldier for one, being\r\n colonel of the 1st Light Infantry regiment; and a Highland soldier\r\n for the other, in gratitude to, and in commemoration of, two soldiers\r\n of the 92nd, who, in the action of the 2nd October, raised me from\r\n the ground, when I was lying on my face, wounded and stunned (they\r\n must have thought me _dead_), and helped me out of the field. As my\r\n senses were returning, I heard one of them say, '_Here is the general;\r\n let us take him away_,' upon which they stooped and raised me by the\r\n arm. I never could discover who they were, and therefore concluded\r\n they must have been _killed_. I hope the 92nd will not have any\r\n objection (as I have commanded them, and as they rendered me such a\r\n service) to my taking one of the corps as a supporter. I do not care\r\n for the drawing being elegant; all I want is the correct uniform and\r\n appointments. Any person who can draw a figure tolerably, but will\r\n dress him correctly, with arms, accoutrements, and in parade order,\r\n will answer every purpose, as I want it for a model only, from which\r\n a painter may draw another. If you are at a loss for a person to do\r\n this, I dare say Lieutenant-Colonel Birch would do it, or get one of\r\n the officers of the department to do so, if you sent a man properly\r\n dressed to Colchester; but I think your own quarters will produce some\r\n one sufficiently expert. I received your letter by Captain (Peter)\r\n Grant, before I left Sandgate: he seems a very gentlemanly young man.\r\n I do not think I can recommend a proper adjutant to you at present.\r\n Remember me kindly to my friends of the 92nd, and believe me, my dear\r\n Napier, sincerely, &c.,\r\n\r\n \"John Moore.[4]\r\n\r\n \"Lieut.-Col. Napier, of Blackstone.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the convention at Alkmaar, and the cessation of hostilities, the\r\nregiment embarked near the Helder, and landed at Yarmouth on the 29th\r\nOctober. Though still suffering from his wound, Cameron obtained the\r\ntemporary command of a light infantry corps under Lord Hopeton. This\r\nprovisional battalion was exercised on Barham Downs, where he won the\r\nreputation of a zealous and able officer. He came home on leave to his\r\nnative glen, kindly bringing with him Ewen M'Millan, who had a craving\r\nto visit his old mother by the shore of Locharkaig.\r\n\r\nThey rejoined the Highlanders soon after, and the next scene of\r\nCameron's service was in Egypt. Before embarking, his regiment was\r\nsupplied with _yellow_ knapsacks, having a red thistle painted on the\r\nbacks of them.\r\n\r\nFassifern accompanied his regiment on General Maitland's futile\r\nexpedition to the Isle de Houat, from whence, with other regiments\r\ndestined for the Mediterranean, they embarked under Lord Dalhousie's\r\norders; and after touching at Port-Mahon in Minorca, passed on to the\r\nattack of Cadiz, which was abandoned, in consequence of a pestilence\r\nthat infected the coast. The expedition then sailed for Malta; and from\r\nthence to the Bay of Marmora, on the coast of Asiatic Turkey, where\r\nAbercrombie had concentrated 15,000 men to expel the French from Egypt.\r\nHe had six regiments of dragoons, and forty battalions of infantry,\r\nseven of which were foreign.\r\n\r\nFassifern served with distinction in all the operations of the Egyptian\r\ncampaign, including the landing effected under a desperate cannonade on\r\nthe shore of Aboukir; the bloody contest round the Tower of Mandora,\r\nwhere his company occupied a conspicuous position in front of the\r\nline, as skirmishers, and where his colonel, Erskine of Cardross,\r\nreceived a mortal wound, and of his comrades there were 109 officers\r\nand men killed and wounded. The intrepid conduct of his regiment was\r\nparticularly mentioned in the dispatches of Abercrombie, whose guard of\r\nhonour was daily furnished from its ranks. Cameron was at the battle of\r\nAlexandria, where, on the 21st March, 1801, he received a wound under\r\nthe left eye, and saw the brave Abercrombie receive his death shot.\r\n\r\nThe troops then advanced to Rosetta; and by the time when the Gordon\r\nHighlanders entered Grand Cairo--\"the Queen of Cities\"--the capital of\r\nMoaz El Kehira, their shoes were completely worn away. Quarter-master\r\nWallace was ordered to procure an immediate supply; but there was one\r\ngigantic grenadier from Speyside, for whom a suitable pair of brogues\r\ncould not be found in all Grand Cairo.\r\n\r\nFor his services in Egypt, Cameron received a gold medal from\r\nthe Grand Seignior; and on the promotion of Major Napier to the\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy, he obtained the majority on the 5th April, 1801;\r\nand seven months afterwards, on the conclusion of that convention, by\r\nwhich Grand Cairo was surrendered, the Highlanders were ordered home to\r\nScotland, and were quartered in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a dispute occurred among the officers. Some of them,\r\nwho were Lowlanders, insisted that the Gaelic, which was generally\r\nspoken at the mess, should be abolished there. It was put to the vote,\r\nand by an overwhelming majority, the Celts secured its retention; but\r\nin those days, there were in the regiment twelve gentlemen of the clan\r\nDonald, all kinsmen, who invariably voted together in everything, and\r\ncould carry any point they pleased. These factions were known as the\r\nnational and anti-national parties.\r\n\r\nAfter the short peace of Amiens, war was declared again; and when the\r\narmy was increased, the Gordon Highlanders were strengthened by the\r\naddition of a second battalion, and Major Cameron marched with it to\r\nWeely in England, to join the force mustered to oppose the expected\r\ninvasion by Napoleon. The invasion ended in smoke; but the battalion\r\nremained cantoned in England until 1807, and in the preceding year\r\nlined the streets of London during the funeral of Nelson. Fassifern\r\nembarked with them at Harwich on the Danish expedition, under Lord\r\nCathcart; and, for the first time, served under Wellington--then Sir\r\nArthur Wellesley--at the attack on Kioge, where Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nNapier, at the head of the Highlanders, charged the Danes, who were\r\nrouted with the loss of their artillery.\r\n\r\nAfter the bombardment of Copenhagen, and the return of the troops to\r\nBritain, Major Cameron, in consideration, of his services, received\r\na brevet lieutenant-colonelcy on the 25th April, 1808; a full\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy on the 23rd June following; and was shortly\r\nafterwards ordered on the Swedish expedition under Sir John Moore, who\r\nled 10,000 men to assist Gustavus Adolphus IV., a gallant but fiery\r\nand intractable prince, against whom Russia and France had united\r\ntheir arms. The violent temper of the Swedish monarch rendered this\r\nundertaking completely futile, and, without achieving anything, the\r\nexpedition returned to Britain.\r\n\r\nAs junior lieutenant-colonel, Cameron now remained with the second\r\nbattalion at home; while the first, under Lieutenant-Colonel Napier,\r\naccompanied Sir John Moore a third time on that fatal service, from\r\nwhich he never returned. In 1809, the gallant Napier fell with his\r\nleader at Corunna, and then Fassifern obtained the command of the\r\nfirst battalion, committing the second, in February, to the care\r\nof Lieutenant-Colonel Lamond, of Lamond. Thus, at the early age of\r\nthirty-seven, and after only fifteen years' service, he found himself\r\nat the head of one of the finest Scottish regiments in the service of\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nIn July, with the right wing of the first battalion, he embarked\r\non board H.M.S. _Superb_, 74, at Harwich, on the great expedition\r\nunder the Earl of Chatham, in Sir William Erskine's brigade. He was\r\nat the landing on Breesand in Walcheren, and the occupation of Ter\r\nGoes on South Beveland. He landed with 998 Highlanders; but so fatal\r\nwas the Dutch pestilence, that in October only 250 of them were on\r\nparade; and the grenadier company, which was entirely recruited from\r\nAberdeenshire, was reduced to _two_ sergeants and _three_ privates.\r\nCameron deeply regretted the loss of his men. The first who died was a\r\nfine young clansman, whom he had brought with him from Lochaber, and\r\nhe attended his funeral in the churchyard of a neighbouring village.\r\nAfter addressing the soldiers on the merits of the deceased, \"Cover him\r\nup with the greenest sods,\" said he, \"for he was a brave lad, a good\r\nsoldier, and true Highlander!\"\r\n\r\nOn its return from this disastrous service, his battalion occupied\r\nWoodbridge Barracks in England. At this time an Englishman obtained\r\nan ensigncy in the corps, which Cameron considered an innovation; for\r\nwhile, on one hand, he disliked the French, from old associations, on\r\nthe other, he was not, for the same reason, over partial to Englishmen,\r\nand was wont to affirm, \"that a Southern in the kilt reminded him of\r\na hog in armour.\" Unfortunately for himself, Ensign Mudge (for such\r\nwas the name of the new acquisition) had no particular love for the\r\nkilt, at which he railed on all occasions, in very coarse terms, and\r\nonce particularly at an Artillery hall in Woolwich, which so roused\r\nCameron's Highland ire, that he vowed, \"if such remarks were ever made\r\nagain by Ensign Mudge, he would bring him to a general court-martial!\"\r\nAt this time, the officers of the 42nd wore the kilt constantly by\r\ntheir own desire.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by Cameron's threat, Mudge wrote to the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nstating that his health would not permit him to wear a dress so\r\nunchristian and uncivilized. Sir David Dundas addressed an answer, not\r\nto him, but to Fassifern, stating that his Majesty had no further use\r\nfor the services of poor Mr. Mudge, on whom this result, which Cameron\r\nand his Highlanders hailed with satisfaction, fell like a thunderclap.\r\n\r\nWhile at Woodbridge, he invited to the mess Dr. Moore (the venerable\r\nfather of the hero of Corunna), who afterwards addressed to him a\r\nletter, expressing his high sense \"of the kind and social reception\"\r\nhe had met with from him and his officers. After this, in July, 1810,\r\nthe battalion marched to Canterbury, previous to embarkation for Spain;\r\nCameron obtained a short leave of absence, and so much had he become\r\nattached to the corps, that he wept when he left it even temporarily.\r\nOn revisiting his native glen, his aged father, then in his seventieth\r\nyear (the old laird was born in 1740), expressed great reluctance to\r\npart with him again, for, like a true Highlander, he had some dark\r\nforebodings of the future.\r\n\r\nHis three sisters were married: Mary, to M'Donald of Glencoe; Jean,\r\nto Roderick M'Neill of Barra; and Catherine, to Cluny M'Pherson; his\r\neldest brother Duncan was practising as a writer to the signet, in the\r\ncapital; and Peter, the second, was away to India in command of the\r\nBalcarras. The old laird was almost alone at Fassifern; he represented\r\nto the colonel, that, though he was only thirty-nine years of age, he\r\nhad received two wounds, from one of which he still suffered; that he\r\nhad been many times engaged with the enemy, and had seen enough of\r\nwar. He urged him to settle at home and to marry; offering him his\r\nsecond estate of Arthurstone, in Angus; but the love of his profession\r\nwas too strong in the heroic heart of Cameron, and he rejoined his\r\nbattalion, then under the command of Major Archibald M'Donell (of the\r\nfamily of Keppoch), at the far-famed _Lines_ of Torres Vedras.\r\n\r\nTo make his regiment as efficient as possible, he ordered that no\r\nofficer who had been less than ten years in the service should ride on\r\nthe march; this diminished the number of useless horses which every\r\nregiment then possessed; while to increase the number of bayonets,\r\nhe turned the whole of the band into the ranks; thus, throughout the\r\nwhole Peninsular War, he retained only the bagpipes, drums, and fifes.\r\nHis regiment belonged to the 1st Brigade, or General Howard's, in the\r\n2nd Division of Infantry, or Lord Hill's, with the 50th, under Colonel\r\nStuart, and the 71st Highlanders, under Colonel Cadogan, with both of\r\nwhom his fiery temper and jealousy on points of etiquette soon involved\r\nhim in a coolness that lasted till they were both removed by death. The\r\nHighlanders entered Spain by the way of Albergaria, and their peculiar\r\ngarb soon changed the constant cry of \"_Live the English_,\" to \"_Viva\r\nlos Escotos! Viva Don Juan Cameron, y sus valiante Escotos! Viva!_\"\r\n\r\nThis was when following up the retreating Massena. Notwithstanding all\r\nefforts of that general to restore the barbarities of ancient warfare,\r\nmuch good feeling prevailed between the French and British when out of\r\nthe field. Of this, one anecdote will suffice.\r\n\r\nA French picket in front of Cameron's regiment, were about to slay\r\na bullock for their dinner, when the animal broke loose, and dashed\r\nacross the neutral ground, where a Highlander killed it by a single\r\nball, and his comrades proceeded immediately to cut up their prize in\r\nview of the hungry and disappointed foe, who sent over two soldiers,\r\nwaving white handkerchiefs. Under these extempore flags of truce, they\r\nbrought a message from their officer, saying that he was \"sure Scottish\r\nsoldiers were too generous to deprive his men of the only provisions\r\nthey had seen for some days.\" The Highlanders sent them back with half\r\nthe beef, several loaves of bread, and a bottle of rum. After this,\r\nthey became so familiar that some of our pickets went over and drank\r\nwith those of the enemy, until Wellington's order forbade it as unsafe\r\nand improper.\r\n\r\nCameron distinguished himself by his activity, at the head of his\r\ngallant Highlanders, in all the arduous operations of that sanguinary\r\nwar. He led his regiment at Fuentes d'Onor, where it was on the\r\nright, covering a brigade of nine pounders, when it endured a severe\r\ncannonade, and had thirty-seven officers and men killed and wounded.\r\nMajor Peter Grant had his arm torn off by a cannon-shot, but he\r\nsurvived to die lately, at a good old age, amongst his kindred in\r\nStrathspey.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was then 897 strong. Cameron was at the second siege of\r\nBadajoz, and at the surprise of Gerard's division, on the 28th of\r\nOctober, 1811, when, on a dark, rainy morning, and under cover of a\r\ndense mist, Sir Rowland Hill's troops attacked the village of Arroya\r\ndel Molinos, or the Mills-of-the-King. In this brilliant affair,\r\nFassifern attacked the two retreating squares of the French with his\r\nHighlanders, and breaking through one, sword in hand, formed on the\r\n_other_ side of the _Puebla_, and completed the overthrow of Marshal\r\nGerard, who had all his artillery, baggage, money, officers, horses,\r\nand 1,400 men taken. In the charge through the village, Cameron\r\nreceived a wound in the sword hand, and Captain M'Pherson, with whom he\r\nfought the duel at Gibraltar, was shot by his side. On this occasion\r\nthe Highlanders had a parody made on the old song of \"Johnny Cope,\" for\r\nGerard, until he heard the pipers of the 92nd playing that popular air,\r\nbelieved the attack to be a mere exchange of shots between his videttes\r\nand the guerillas. Cameron's wound was a narrow escape, and is thus\r\nmentioned by an eye-witness:[5]\r\n\r\n\"The captain of the grenadier company having been wounded early in the\r\naction, the senior lieutenant, on assuming the command of it, made a\r\nfalse movement; on perceiving which, the colonel, greatly irritated,\r\nrepeated his former orders in a voice of thunder, and, as was his\r\nusual custom when displeased, struck his left breast with his right\r\nhand, which then grasped the hilt of his sword. The last syllable\r\nof his orders had just been delivered, when a bullet, despatched by\r\none of the enemy's riflemen, struck the first joint of his middle\r\nfinger, shattered the bone, passed through the handle of the sword,\r\nand struck his breast so violently, that he relinquished the command\r\nof the battalion to Major Mitchell, in the full conviction that the\r\nball had passed into his body. On being undeceived, the gallant colonel\r\ninstantly rejoined his battalion, and, with his middle finger dangling\r\nby a small piece of skin only, remained at the head of his Highlanders\r\nto the close of the engagement.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the French were completely driven out, and when Hill's division\r\nwas on the march for San Pedro, Cameron, who had lost much blood, was\r\nconducted by Ewen M'Millan to a house in Arroya, to have the wound\r\ndressed, and the finger, which yet dangled by a sinew, cut off. On\r\nentering, they found it occupied by a noisy and tipsy party of Spanish\r\ndragoons, who, notwithstanding the rank and wound of Fassifern,\r\nendeavoured to eject him. High words ensued, and a dragoon dared to\r\naim a blow at his head with a sabre. Cameron instinctively raised his\r\nwounded hand for protection, and had his right arm cut to the bone.\r\nRendered furious by the sight of his master's blood, M'Millan levelled\r\nhis musket at the head of the insolent Spaniard, and would have shot\r\nhim dead; but Cameron, who was aware that the Conde de Penne Villamur's\r\ndragoons occupied the whole village, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Desist, Ewen, for God's sake do not fire!\" and struck up his\r\nfoster-brother's musket, the bullet from which pierced the ceiling. He\r\nnever could discover the perpetrator of this severe wound, from the\r\neffects of which he suffered long.\r\n\r\nDuring the harassing marches of Hill's division in the desolate\r\nEstramadura, his native hardihood never flinched, though the miseries\r\nendured by the troops were excessive in that naked district, where\r\nthey were constantly in arrears of pay, bivouacking without tents or\r\nfires, or cantoned in roofless and ruined towns, marching day and night\r\nin the wet and chill of winter, or the heat of the summer solano,\r\nwhen the white dust blew down the mountain passes, and the air became\r\nthick with flies; when the soil of the vast plains cracked and rent;\r\nwhen the perspiration rose in hazy steam above the marching columns;\r\nwhen comrades fought like tigers around the wayside wells and casual\r\npools, to fill their canteens at the puddle through which, perhaps,\r\nthe advanced guard had passed an hour before; when years of hardship,\r\ndanger, starvation, and rags were to be endured, Fassifern never had\r\na day's illness or absence from parade; nor did his hardy Gordon\r\nHighlanders ever lose a man by fatigue, save upon two occasions.\r\n\r\nThese exceptions were Lieutenants Marshall and Hill, two fine young\r\nofficers; the first of whom died in a wretched bullock car--died of\r\nsheer starvation, as he was being conveyed into Badajoz; and the\r\nsecond, unable to keep up with his men, perished of the same awful\r\ndeath among the mountains, between Talavera and Toledo. It is said\r\nthat, on many occasions, Fassifern would have starved also, but for the\r\nvigorous efforts of his foster-brother and henchman, Ewen M'Millan,\r\nwho, despite Lord Wellington's orders, plundered the Dons without\r\nmercy, when the comfort of his chieftain and master required him to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nAfter incessant skirmishes and daily marches along the banks of the\r\nTagus, and after a desperate affair of outposts at La Nava, on the 18th\r\nMay, 1812, Hill marched to destroy the forts erected by the French at\r\nthe bridge of Almarez. The 50th, and a wing of the 71st Highlanders,\r\nformed one column, which was destined to attack Fort Napoleon; Cameron\r\nwith his regiment, and the remainder of the 71st, had orders to support\r\nthe attack, and storm the _tête-du-pont_. Both columns were amply\r\nprovided with scaling-ladders. As the troops descended a _rut_ of\r\nthe sierra, in Indian file, about midnight, Mr. Irvine, a gentleman\r\nvolunteer, left his ranks to obtain a draught of water. This was\r\ncontrary to express orders; and such was Cameron's strictness, that he\r\ndismissed him from the regiment on the instant, and the poor fellow was\r\nleft alone among the mountains of Romangordo.\r\n\r\nBeing proud of his own regiment, Cameron had a great jealousy of the\r\n71st Highlanders; and when the attack commenced, on some of their\r\nbullets, in the twilight and confusion, whistling over his own ranks,\r\nhe called aloud--\r\n\r\n\"Seventy-first! what the devil are you about? Do you wish the\r\nninety-second to return your fire?\"\r\n\r\nFort Napoleon was stormed in gallant style. Captain Candler, of the\r\n50th, was shot through the head; but the French were driven towards\r\nthe _tête-du-pont_. Then Cameron entered it with them pell-mell, with\r\nbayonets charged, muskets clubbed, swords and sledge-hammers. But\r\nthe commandant of Fort Ragusa, on the opposite side, cut the pontoon\r\nbridge, and thus the whole garrison of Fort Napoleon found the deep\r\nTagus before them, and the foe behind.\r\n\r\nEager to capture Ragusa, many of Cameron's men flung themselves into\r\nthe river, and daringly swam across. Privates Gall and Somerville\r\nwere the first men who brought over the pontoon bridge. On gaining\r\npossession of the platforms, which were literally ankle-deep in brains\r\nand blood, the 1st brigade slued round the cannon upon the French, and\r\nblew their heads off in scores, as they crowded into the square of the\r\nlittle fortress, where the 71st Highlanders captured a standard of the\r\n_Corps Etranger_.\r\n\r\nThe dead, 436 in number, were thrown into the ditch; the ramparts,\r\nwith eighteen cannon, were hurled over them; the stone towers were\r\nblown up; the barracks and storehouses burned down; and the whole\r\nplace laid bare. In the general pillage which ensued, a Highlander\r\nbecame mutinous to Cameron, who raised his claymore to cut him down;\r\nbut the descending blow was turned aside by a sergeant, named Taylor,\r\nwho kindly interposed his pike between them. Even when the gust of\r\npassion passed away, Cameron could not forgive the affront of Taylor's\r\ninterference before his men, and was headstrong enough to resent it\r\nin the following manner: When the sergeants drew lots for the command\r\nof a firing party to shoot a deserter at Coria, Taylor escaped this\r\nhateful ballot, but nevertheless Cameron ordered him to take charge of\r\nthe execution. Taylor gave him a glance full of reproach, and burst\r\ninto tears, yet he obeyed, and shot the culprit dead. Then Cameron\r\nrepented the casual malevolence which is sometimes to be found even yet\r\namong the Celts, when an affront has been given them. At Merida, he\r\nwas pall-bearer during the grand military funeral generously bestowed\r\non the commandant of Almarez, who had been slain there by an officer\r\nof the 71st Highlanders, and who was buried with the honours due to a\r\nBritish officer of the same rank.\r\n\r\nCameron's native dislike to receive orders from seniors, his jealousy\r\nof the 71st, and _Old Half-hundred_, involved him in many quarrels\r\nwith Colonels Cadogan and Stuart, and even in an angry correspondence\r\nwith Wellington. It was then currently rumoured in the Highland\r\nregiments, that the great Duke had some dislike to their nation. The\r\nGordon Highlanders added, that he viewed coldly old Sir William Stuart,\r\nFassifern, and Major Mitchell, from whom they averred that he withheld\r\nmany honours to which they were entitled. What amount of truth these\r\nrumours contained, it is _now_ impossible to learn. High words ensued\r\non one occasion between the colonel and his great leader, to whom he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord Marquis, thank God! I am beholden to no man for my bread--not\r\neven to the service, for I have a comfortable home to retire to\r\nwhenever I please.\"\r\n\r\nThe real source of this bitterness of feeling is unknown; but it\r\ncontinued during the whole war.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion his pride revolted at General Howard for keeping the\r\nregiment too long under arms before inspection! and he sent Lieutenant\r\nGrant to the Brigadier's billet with a brief message, \"that the\r\nregiment awaited him.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, it chanced that by mistake he and a Spanish\r\ncolonel were billeted on the same mansion, and as it was thought too\r\nsmall to accommodate both, he resolved to turn out the Don who was\r\nalready in possession of the premises. On Cameron arriving with the\r\ncolours, which were borne by his cousin, Ewen Ross, and another ensign,\r\nand were escorted by four sergeants with their pikes, the Spanish\r\ncolonel appeared in the doorway with his Toledo drawn and pistols\r\ncocked. Fassifern drew his claymore. \"Forward, gentlemen,\" said he; \"at\r\nall risks I command you to lodge the colours!\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeants charged with their pikes, and we know not how the affair\r\nmight have ended, had not Villamur's corps of Spanish horse turned the\r\ncorner of the street; this forced the rash chieftain to parley with the\r\ncavalier, and share his quarters in peace.\r\n\r\nAfter the night of blood at Almarez, Cameron and his Highlanders\r\nmarched by Fuente del Maistre, Los Santos, the hill of Albuera, and\r\nmany other places, bivouacking with their brigade wherever night found\r\nthem, preparatory to the attack on the forts at Salamanca, and the\r\nbattle there, which was fought, while Hill's division covered Lord\r\nWellington's rear. After joining the grand army on these contested\r\nplains, the Highlanders were reviewed by their great general. Rations\r\nhad been served out that morning; the sheep-heads had been assigned to\r\nthe 92nd, and when they marched past by open column of companies, every\r\nsixth man carried a sheep's head in his left hand.\r\n\r\nWhen Wellington entered Madrid, the Highlanders of Cameron for one\r\nnight occupied the Escuriel, in the chapel of which the remains of a\r\nking and queen of Scotland (Malcolm III. and St. Margaret) are said to\r\nlie, having been conveyed to Spain in 1560. After Cameron marched to\r\nAranjuez, his cousin, Ewen Ross, had a narrow escape from a terrible\r\ndeath. Having been ordered to the rear with sick and wounded from the\r\nbrigade, and having no less than twelve waggons-full of officers,\r\nhe reached Badajoz, after encountering many difficulties, and there\r\nfound that various outrages committed by the detachment of Lieutenant\r\nH----, of the 28th, were laid to the charge of his party, such as\r\nshooting and plundering the paisanos, robbing them of _burros_, wine,\r\nand provisions. Lack of Spanish prevented the gallant Highlander\r\nfrom explaining that he was not the guilty person; and the Marquis\r\ndel Palacio, governor of Badajoz, illegally tried him by a Spanish\r\ncourt-martial, and unscrupulously sentenced him to death! Then fearing\r\nto carry this sentence into execution, he sent him, under an escort of\r\nPortuguese horse, to Elvas, where an English officer saved him from a\r\nrabble who were bent on his destruction, and he was enabled to rejoin\r\nCameron in safety. On this march he saved from starvation Mr. Irvine,\r\nthe poor volunteer, whom he found in a state of destitution near\r\nTruxillo.\r\n\r\nCameron and his Highlanders endured great misery on the disastrous\r\nretreat from Burgos. Deprivation of food reduced the poor men almost to\r\nskeletons; their uniform was worn to rags; many were barefooted, and\r\nshirtless. Undeterred by the cruel exhibition of a soldier hung _daily_\r\nat the head of the column (for of twenty men under sentence of death\r\nfor plundering, one was thus sacrificed every day), the 92nd shot some\r\nwild pigs in a wood through which they passed. _Big_ Dugald Campbell,\r\none of their favourite officers, drove his long claymore through the\r\nbody of a boar which he pursued through the thicket, and claimed from\r\nsome cazadores. This prize he shared with Cameron and other officers;\r\nbut the affair drew forth a most severe reprimand from head-quarters,\r\nand this was at a time when a _duro_ was given for a handful of\r\noats or nuts, and when some of the officers had no other food for\r\nsix-and-thirty hours than a few mushrooms or acorns.\r\n\r\nFassifern's regiment formed part of the small force which was left with\r\nGeneral Howard to secure Wellington's retreat, by defending the old\r\nruined town of Alba at the passage of the rapid Tormes. There the 50th,\r\n71st, and 92nd made a gallant stand on the 8th of November, 1812. After\r\na long and fatiguing march, and just when about to receive a little\r\nration of dry bread--the first food after three days of starvation--the\r\nappearance of the whole pursuing French army under Joseph Bonaparte,\r\nsummoned the brigade to man the old and shattered walls of Alba--a\r\nrelic of the Moorish wars--while the sappers undermined the bridge of\r\nthe Tormes. Two green hills overlooked the town and river. Between\r\nthese and the wall, within pistol-shot of the 92nd Highlanders, a\r\nFrench staff-officer, mounted on a white charger, had the temerity\r\nto ride leisurely reconnoitring, and followed by an orderly on foot.\r\nTwenty Highlanders levelled their muskets to shoot this daring fellow,\r\nbut the chivalric Cameron cried aloud:\r\n\r\n\"Recover your arms there! I will by no means permit an individual to be\r\nfired on!\"\r\n\r\nThis officer who acted so boldly, and thus escaped so narrowly, proved\r\nto be no other than _Marshal Soult_, who, in ten minutes after, ordered\r\neighteen pieces of cannon up to the heights, from whence they poured\r\n1300 rounds of shot and shell on the brave brigade of Howard. This\r\nwas endured until the 13th, by which time Cameron lost forty-two men\r\nkilled and wounded. At daybreak, on the morning of the 14th, a despatch\r\narrived from Wellington, directing Howard to abandon Alba, as the\r\nFrench cavalry, 3000 strong, had forded the river above the town and\r\nturned his flank. A Spanish garrison was left in the old castle of the\r\n_Castigador de Flamencos_--the walls were abandoned, and the bridge\r\nblown up. Lieutenant John Grant of the 92nd was the last officer who\r\nquitted the town, being left to bring off the sentinels, as the French\r\nentered, and he was struck by the stones as the mine under the bridge\r\nexploded, at the very heels of his party.\r\n\r\nWellington's admirable foresight saved Howard's brigade, which retired\r\nto winter quarters at Coria, in Leon, when, with many other officers\r\nand soldiers, Colonel Stewart of the 50th, as brave a Scot as ever\r\ndrew a sword, expired of exhaustion and fatigue. A soldier of the 50th\r\ncarved a rude stone to mark where this old officer was laid.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by six months' rest in winter quarters at Banos, in a\r\nbeautiful valley of Leon, overshadowed by high mountains, Cameron,\r\nafter commanding the 1st brigade during General Foy's attack on Bejar,\r\nmarched with his Highlanders, when the whole army advanced to turn\r\nthe famous positions of Jourdan on the Ebro and Douro, and to meet him\r\non the green plains of Vittoria, where, on the 21st of June, 1813,\r\nhe again commanded the 1st brigade of Hill's division, and carried\r\nthe heights of La Peubla, when the gallant Cadogan fell amid heaps,\r\nliterally heaps, of his brave Highlanders.\r\n\r\nSir William Stuart having ordered Cameron to secure the heights, added,\r\n\"yield them to none without a written order from Sir Rowland Hill\r\nor myself, and defend them while you have a man remaining.\" On this\r\nFassifern ordered the pipers to strike up the \"Camerons' Gathering,\"\r\nand the regiment advanced with great spirit and alacrity up the\r\nmountain side.\r\n\r\nAfter this victory, the most decisive of the Spanish war, Cameron\r\npushed on with his brigade towards the Pyrenees, beyond which the\r\nconqueror drove the French like a herd of sheep, and then garrisoned\r\nthe heights by a chain of outposts, previous to besieging San\r\nSebastian, and blockading Pampeluna. On this occasion the care of the\r\nimportant pass of Maya was entirely assigned to Cameron, with the 1st\r\nbrigade, after it had crossed the Bidassoa, and skirmished with the\r\nrouted French until darkness set in, on the 7th July.\r\n\r\nCameron commanded this great outpost until the 25th of that month, when\r\nthe French advanced to storm the heights under the Duke of Dalmatia,\r\nwho had assumed the command of Jourdan's discomfited host, and was\r\ndirected to retrieve all its disasters by driving the British beyond\r\nthe Ebro. Full of confidence and of hope, at least to relieve the two\r\nbeleaguered fortresses, this brave marshal sent his legions against the\r\nvarious passes in the mountains which Wellington, who was then urging\r\nthe siege of San Sebastian in person, had occupied by battalions and\r\nbrigades.\r\n\r\nCameron's force was encamped in the centre of a lonely gorge, and his\r\noutposts were far down the hillside in advance; and these, on Sunday\r\nthe 25th, descried the division of General Drouet, 15,000 strong,\r\nadvancing on the road that led from Urdax. Coming on with great\r\nspirit, they drove in the three light companies of the brigade (which\r\nCameron had dispatched as skirmishers in front), and gained the high\r\nrock of Maya before the 2nd brigade of infantry could come to his\r\nsupport. His little band were thus left to defend that steep and narrow\r\npass against _five_ times their number. On this fatal morning the\r\nstrength of the Gordon Highlanders was only fifty-five staff, and 762\r\nrank and file.\r\n\r\nTo deceive the foe as to his real strength, Cameron skilfully divided\r\nhis Highlanders into two wings, in open columns of companies, thus\r\ngiving the slender battalion the aspect of _two_ regiments; but this\r\n_ruse_ was useless, as the traitor-muleteers, who, for the few weeks\r\npreceding, had been passing between the mountains and French outposts,\r\nhad made Soult fully aware of the actual force left to defend the\r\nPyrenees at every point. The moment the action commenced, Fassifern\r\ndetached the 50th to the right, where, after a desperate conflict, it\r\nwas driven back and forced to leave the ridge.\r\n\r\nUnder Major M'Pherson, Cameron then sent forward first the right\r\nwing, and then the left, of his brave Highlanders. Then ensued one\r\nof the most appalling scenes of carnage recorded in the annals of\r\nthat protracted war. The Highlanders stood like a rampart, in which,\r\nhowever, frightful gaps were made by the bullets of the French, who\r\ncame on, in one vast mob, shouting and brandishing their eagles.\r\nSeparating the 1st and 2nd brigades, they descended upon the pass of\r\nMaya from one flank, while a fresh division poured upon its front\r\nfrom the Urdax road. Cameron, who had repeatedly ordered a _charge_,\r\nwhich was unheard amid the roar of the musketry, then made the whole\r\nfall back gradually upon the rock of Maya; a movement which was slowly\r\nand desperately covered by the left wings of the 71st Highland Light\r\nInfantry and of the Gordon Highlanders, which, by relieving each\r\nother, drenched in blood every inch of the ground; and there these\r\ngallant men defended the rock for ten successive hours, until--just\r\nwhen ammunition was falling short--the brigade of General Barnes\r\narrived to their succour, and Lieutenant-General the Hon. Sir William\r\nStuart, a fine old soldier whom all the troops loved well, ordered\r\nCameron's brigade _not_ to charge; but, exasperated by the slaughter\r\nthey had endured, they rushed upon the French with the bayonet, and\r\nthe Gordon Highlanders, \"_for the first time disregarded orders, and\r\nnot only charged, but led the charge_,\" and recovered every foot of\r\nground as far as the pass from which they had been driven. In this\r\nheadlong advance the pipers played the \"Haughs of Cromdale,\" and the\r\nline was led by Captain Seton of Pitmedden, bonnet and claymore in\r\nhand. But the slaughter in their ranks was terrible, for 19 officers\r\nand 324 rank and file were killed, wounded, and missing. Among the\r\nwounded were--Cameron, who was shot through the thigh, and forced to\r\nleave the field; Major Mitchel, who succeeded him; Captains Holmes, and\r\nBevan, who died when his arm was taken out of the socket, and Ronald\r\nM'Donald of Coul; Lieutenants Winchester, who commanded the light\r\ncompany; Donald M'Donald, Chisholm, Durie, M'Pherson, and Fife, who,\r\nafter having one ball turned by a button, and another by his watch, was\r\nstruck down at last; Gordon, Kerr Ross, and John Grant, who was shot\r\nthrough the side. Among the ensigns were Thomas and George Mitchell,\r\nEwen Kennedy (one of Cameron's Lochaber men), who bled to death on the\r\nfield, and Alaster M'Donald of Dalchosnie, a youth of eighteen, who\r\nafterwards expired of a wound in the head, and was buried by four of\r\nhis brother officers in a hole outside the town-gate of Vittoria, where\r\nHolmes said a short prayer over his grave.\r\n\r\nSir William Napier, in his history, thus alludes to Fassifern and the\r\ntwo regiments of Highlanders: \"And that officer (Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCameron), still holding the pass of Maya with the left wings of the\r\n71st and 92nd Regiments, brought their right wings and the Portuguese\r\nguns into action, and thus maintained the fight; but so dreadful was\r\nthe slaughter, that it is said the advancing enemy was actually stopped\r\nby the heaped-up mass of dead and dying.... The stern valour of the\r\n92nd would have graced _Thermopylæ_.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, Lieutenant Gordon died at Edinburgh sixteen years\r\nafter, under the hands of a surgeon who was extracting the ball\r\nreceived at Maya, and he lies now in the Calton burying-ground. Two\r\nballs grazed Cameron, but the third pierced the fleshy part of his\r\nright thigh. In great agony he called to M'Millan, who slung his\r\nmusket, rushed to his side, and led his horse by the bridle out of\r\nthe field. \"The gallant Cameron, who has so frequently bled for his\r\ncountry,\" says the _Pilot_ of 12th October, 1813, \"received _three_\r\nshots in his person, his horse received three, and three more were\r\nfound in his cloak, which was strapped before his saddle in the usual\r\nmanner.\" He lost so much blood, that, being unable to reach Vittoria,\r\nwhich was a hundred miles distant, and to which all the wounded were\r\nordered to repair, he remained at an intermediate village until the\r\nscar healed and he could rejoin the regiment at Roncesvalles, after it\r\nhad been engaged between Lizasso and Eguaros, and on the heights of\r\nDonna Maria, having in both affairs 120 officers and men killed and\r\nwounded. Captain Seton brought the regiment out of the field: thus the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, on the 24th of June, might well say\r\nthat the Spaniards of future times would point with pride to the places\r\n\"where a Stuart made his stand, and where the best blood of Scotland\r\nwas shed in their defence.\" For his bravery at the Pyrenees, his\r\nMajesty was pleased to permit Cameron to bear upon his shield the word\r\n_Maya_.\r\n\r\nFrom this period he was incessantly engaged in all the operations along\r\nthe French Pyrenees, in daily skirmishes, and the capture of entrenched\r\ncamps. The country was now covered by snow, and the troops endured\r\nmany privations, which Sir William Stuart (brother of Lord Galloway)\r\ndid all in his power to alleviate, by issuing extra allowances of rum,\r\nwhich won him the cognomen of _Auld Grog Willie_; and his popularity\r\nwas so great among all the troops, that his appearance was always\r\nhailed by a noisy cheer, and shouts of \"God bless you, Sir William!\"\r\nLord Wellington disliked this, and compelled the general to refund to\r\nGovernment all those _extra_ allowances of rum served out to the poor\r\nsoldiers amid the snows of that severe winter on the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nCameron, who had long remarked that those officers of his 1st Battalion\r\nwho became by promotion members of the 2nd, and should consequently\r\nbe at home, were always unfortunate if the corps were engaged, before\r\nthe passage of the Nive ordered four of them to leave immediately for\r\nBritain, when the troops were about to cross the river.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, gentlemen,\" said he, as they bade him adieu; \"I am now\r\ntired of war, and may well wish I were going with you.\"\r\n\r\nBut, mounted on his charger, he was the first to cross the Nivelle,\r\nbelow Ainhoe, when his daring Highlanders were ordered to storm the\r\nstrong redoubt in rear of the village, where they drove out the French\r\nand took possession of their huts. Here his favourite piper was killed\r\nby his side; and with his own hand he strove to raise him, exclaiming,\r\n\"I would rather lose twenty men than have lost you!\" He led them\r\nthrough the Nive at Cambo; and in the attack upon those heavy columns\r\nwhich occupied the ground between the entrenched camp at Bayonne and\r\nthe road to St. Jean Pied-de-Port, he fought valiantly at the battle\r\nof St. Pierre. There (Napier relates), at one period of the day, the\r\noverwhelming cannonade and musketry drove the 92nd in rear of the\r\nhamlet; however, on being succoured by their old comrades, the 50th,\r\nand Ashworth's Caçadores, they re-formed behind St. Pierre, and \"then\r\ntheir gallant colonel, Cameron, once more led them down the road,\r\nwith colours flying and pipes playing, resolved to give the shock to\r\nwhatever stood in their way. The 92nd was but a small clump compared to\r\nthe heavy mass in front;\" but Fassifern led them on as of old, and the\r\n_heavy mass_ rolled before their bayonets like mist before the wind.\r\nFour times that day he led them to brilliant charges, and four times\r\nthe foe was driven back. Cameron had 13 officers and 173 rank and file\r\nkilled and wounded; but he obtained an honorary badge, inscribed with\r\nthe word _Nive_.\r\n\r\nAfter the attack on the enemy at Hellette, in the lower Pyrenees,\r\nwhere General Harispe was driven out, and forced to retire to Meharin;\r\nand after that gallant conflict on the heights of Garris, where Cameron\r\nlost Seton of Pitmedden, and twelve other brave fellows, the scene of\r\nhis next achievement was the pretty village of Arriverette, on the\r\nright bank of Gave de Mauleon, where the French endeavoured to destroy\r\na wooden bridge, to prevent Wellington from following them; but a\r\nford being discovered above it, Cameron boldly threw himself into\r\nthe stream, at the head of his Highlanders, crossed under a fire of\r\nartillery, stormed the village, drove back the enemy, and, by securing\r\nthe bridge, enabled the whole troops to pass. For this eminent service\r\nhis Majesty granted to him, as an additional crest of honourable\r\naugmentation, a Highlander of the 92nd foot, \"armed and accoutred,\r\nup to the middle in water, his dexter hand grasping a broadsword, in\r\nhis sinister a banner, inscribed, '92nd,' within a wreath of laurel,\r\nall proper, and on an escroll above, the word _Arriverette_.\"[6] But\r\nCameron had now a fresh cause of displeasure at his great leader; for,\r\non applying to him, through Lieutenant-General Lord Niddry, for leave\r\nto inscribe _Arriverette_ upon the regimental colours, Wellington\r\ndeclined, without affording any satisfactory reason. He acknowledged,\r\nin his reply, that \"the 92nd forded the river, and took the village\r\nagainst a superior force of the enemy, in most gallant style;\" but\r\nadded that it was beneath their reputation to explain _why_ they should\r\nnot have Arriverette on their colours. This ambiguous reply Cameron\r\nconsidered another affront, and never forgot or forgave it.\r\n\r\nHe received an honorary badge for his conduct at the battle of Orthez;\r\nand on the 2nd March, 1814, distinguished himself at the capture of\r\nAire so prominently, that George III. desired him to bear embattled in\r\nchief above the old cognizance of Lochiel (as the heraldic record above\r\nquoted has it), \"a representation of the town of Aire, in allusion to\r\nhis glorious services on the 2nd March last, when, after an arduous\r\nand sanguinary conflict, he succeeded in forcing a superior body of\r\nthe enemy to abandon the said town, and subsequently had the honour to\r\nreceive an address from the inhabitants, expressive of their gratitude\r\nfor the maintenance of discipline, by which he had saved them from\r\nplunder and destruction.\" The address, which was so complimentary to\r\nhis distinguished regiment, was signed by M. Codroy, the mayor, in the\r\nname of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom thence he accompanied the troops in that hot and brilliant\r\npursuit, which did not cease until the French evacuated Toulouse, and\r\nthe white banner of Bourbon was displayed upon its walls. The seizure\r\nof Paris by the allies, the abdication of Bonaparte and proclamation\r\nof peace, the restoration of Louis XVIII., rapidly followed, and the\r\nPeninsular army was ordered home.\r\n\r\nIn the last skirmish near Toulouse, Cameron had his favourite horse\r\nshot under him; and, though there was a hot fire of musketry sweeping\r\nthe place where it lay, M'Millan deliberately unbuckled the girths of\r\nthe saddle, and brought it away with the cloak and holsters, saying,\r\nthat \"though the French were welcome to the dead carcase, they should\r\nnot get the good accoutrements.\"\r\n\r\nWhen encamped at Blanchefort, two miles from Bordeaux, Cameron obtained\r\nhis brevet colonelcy on the 4th June, 1814;[7] and when cantoned at\r\nPouillac, his Highlanders joyfully received the route for Scotland, and\r\non the 17th July embarked on board H.M.S. _Norge_, which, however, by a\r\nchange of destination, landed them at the Cove of Cork.\r\n\r\nWhile his regiment, now reduced to one battalion, was in Ireland,\r\nCameron returned, on leave, to his native glen at Fassifern.\r\n\r\nWellington had then won all the honours a subject could attain: patents\r\nof nobility, baronetcy, and knighthood were issued for generals of\r\ndivision and brigade; Orders of the Garter, the Bath, and the Crescent\r\nwere unsparingly lavished among the heroes of the war; but the brave\r\nCameron, notwithstanding all his services--though he had been almost\r\nriddled by musket-shot, and had served in Sweden, Denmark, Holland,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Egypt, and France, at home and abroad, for twenty-one\r\nyears--found that the Duke of Wellington had _omitted_ his name in the\r\nlist of officers recommended for honorary distinctions. He visited\r\nLondon, and complained to the Duke of York, who offered to have him\r\ngazetted as an additional Cross of the Bath.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your highness will excuse me,\" said he, \"for as my name has been\r\nomitted, I will not accept of it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the duke, \"do you know to whom you are speaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"A prince of that royal blood for which I have too often shed my own;\r\nbut am yet willing to do so again. And I have the honour to wish your\r\nHighness good morning.\"\r\n\r\nIn this haughty fashion he quitted the Horse Guards, but was afterwards\r\nprevailed upon to write to Wellington.\r\n\r\nJustly indignant, he wrote a fiery remonstrance to the duke, who was\r\nthen at Vienna, and who, in one of his letters to Earl Bathurst, dated\r\n5th February, mentions it as a _somewhat imprudent production_; but his\r\nGrace replied to the following effect:--\r\n\r\n \"Vienna, 5th February, 1815.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,--I received your letter of the 8th January, this morning, and I\r\n have transmitted it to the Secretary of State, with my recommendation\r\n of you.\r\n\r\n \"The Government fixed the occasions on which medals should be granted\r\n to the army, and framed the rules, according to which I was bound\r\n to make the lists of those to whom they were to be granted; and not\r\n having received their orders to recommend for medals, for the service\r\n at Arroya del Molinos, Alba de Tormes, Bejar, Aire, or at Arriverette,\r\n it was impossible for me to recommend you for a medal at Fuentes\r\n d'Onoro, or in the Pyrenees, according to the rules by which I was\r\n bound to make out the lists of those I recommended. I have not an\r\n accurate recollection of the lists for Bayonne, the Nivelle, Orthez,\r\n and Toulouse; but of this I am very certain, _that I have never failed\r\n to do your services justice_, as it was my earnest desire to render it\r\n to every officer and soldier I had the honour of commanding.\r\n\r\n \"I have nothing to say about the selection of the officers recently\r\n appointed Knights Commanders of the Order of the Bath. I did not know\r\n their names till I saw the list of them in the _Gazette_. If you had\r\n known these facts, I hope that the same spirit of justice by which I\r\n have always been animated, would have induced you to spare me the pain\r\n of reading the _reproaches and charges of injustice_ contained in your\r\n letter; and that you would have defended me in the 92nd Regiment; and\r\n would have shown them that the regulation, and not I, deprived you of\r\n those marks of honour which they wished to see you obtain. As these\r\n facts are in the knowledge of everybody, it is scarcely possible to\r\n believe that you were not aware of them, and I attribute the harshness\r\n of your letter solely to the irritation which you naturally feel in\r\n considering your own case. However, the expression of this irritation,\r\n however unjust towards me, and unpleasant to my feelings, has not\r\n made me forget the services which you and your brave corps rendered\r\n upon every occasion on which you were called upon; and, although I am\r\n afraid it is _too late_, I have recommended you in the strongest terms\r\n to the Secretary of State; and have the honour to be, &c.,\r\n\r\n \"Wellington.\r\n\r\n \"To Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, 92nd Regiment.\"\r\n\r\nCameron saw there was something at least generous in the tone of this\r\nletter, and he sent a memorial for the Order of the Bath; for the medal\r\nwhich had been given to officers engaged at Fuentes d'Onoro, and also\r\nfor the Order of the Tower and Sword. Wellington replied as follows:--\r\n\r\n \"Vienna, February, 1815.\r\n\r\n \"SIR,--I have received your letter of the 13th January, and the copy\r\n of your memorial; in answer to which I can only inform you, that I\r\n had no concern whatever in the selection of the officers of the army\r\n lately under my command to be Knights Commanders of the Order of\r\n the Bath; and as I see that the number limited is filled, I am quite\r\n certain that no application I can make will answer any purpose. I\r\n will inquire about your claim to a medal for Fuentes d'Onoro. I have\r\n recommended you for the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword; and\r\n have the honour, &c.,\r\n\r\n \"Wellington.\r\n\r\n \"To Lieut.-Colonel Cameron, 92nd Regiment.\"\r\n\r\nFassifern received the Portuguese order, but he was too much of a\r\nHighlander to forget the first unmerited affront, of being omitted or\r\nforgotten; and now we can but hope that this omission of the great duke\r\nwas, at least, an unwitting one.\r\n\r\nLike every Highlander of the old school, and like many of the present\r\nday, Cameron believed in the Taisch, or Second Sight; he had one other\r\nfancy, a dread of being on the water, or at sea; thus he who would face\r\nwithout flinching a shower of grape or hedge of bayonets, has been\r\nknown to grow pale at the rocking of a small boat.\r\n\r\nWhen at home, on leave, in 1815, he visited Mor'ar, in Lochaber, the\r\nseat of Colonel Simon M'Donald, a retired officer who had joined the\r\n92nd at their first muster in 1793. One day when passing along a\r\ncorridor together, and about to enter the dining-room, M'Donald started\r\nback, with his eyes fixed in their sockets, his face pale as death, and\r\nhis limbs trembling.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name, what is the matter Mor'ar?\" asked Cameron.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" replied M'Donald, after a pause, and greatly agitated;\r\n\"nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You _have_ seen something, Simon,\" continued Cameron, impressively,\r\nfor he knew, or believed, that the gift of the Taisch was hereditary in\r\nthe family of Mor'ar.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I have seen something, Fassifern,\" said M'Donald, passing\r\na hand over his eyes with a troubled expression; \"but do not ask me\r\nwhat it was.\"\r\n\r\nMor'ar was thoughtful and sad for a long time after, and it was\r\ncurrently believed that he had seen some vision of his old friend's\r\napproaching end; for the day-dreams of the Highland seers are always\r\nfraught with death and sorrow. Immediately after this, war broke out\r\nagain; Bonaparte quitted Elba, returned to Paris, and resumed the reins\r\nof government, while Louis XVIII. withdrew to Ghent.\r\n\r\nWellington once more took the field, and the 92nd Highlanders were\r\nordered to Flanders, with the other forces under his command. Cameron\r\nhastened to rejoin, in Ireland, where the regiment was still stationed.\r\nIts second battalion, under Lamond of that ilk, had been disbanded at\r\nEdinburgh, all save twelve sergeants and 174 soldiers, who, with five\r\nofficers, marched to Portpatrick to join the head-quarters; and on this\r\nroute an interesting episode occurred.\r\n\r\nAs the Highlanders, with pipes playing, marched past a little wayside\r\ncottage, an old and white-haired man came out to see them, and was\r\nimmediately recognised as their brave and favourite general in Spain,\r\nSir William Stuart, who, neglected by the Government, had retired there\r\nto brood over his unrequited services. A hearty cheer welcomed \"_Auld\r\nGrog Willie_.\" Then the brave Stuart burst into tears, and wept like\r\na child. The detachment was formed into line, and inspected by him;\r\nperhaps the last military duty he ever performed, for rumour says that\r\nhe died soon after of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nCameron embarked with his Highlanders at Cork, for Ostend, from whence,\r\nwith eight battalions under his command, viz., the third battalion of\r\nthe Royal Scots; the 28th, 32nd, 42nd, 44th, 79th, 92nd, and third\r\nbattalion of the 95th Rifle corps, he marched, _viâ_ Ghent and Bruges,\r\nto Brussels, where, on the 3rd June, 1815, his Highlanders, with the\r\nbrigade to which they belonged--the 5th or Sir Denis Pack's--were\r\nreviewed by Wellington, then a field-marshal. In the 5th corps were\r\nalso the 1st Royal Scots, the 42nd Highlanders, and 44th Regiment.\r\n\r\nWhen Pack's brigade was under arms in the Park of Brussels, the Duchess\r\nof Richmond, who had been Lady Charlotte Gordon, passed in an open\r\ncarriage along the line. Colonel MacQuarrie, of the 42nd, gallantly\r\nmade his Highlanders _present arms_ to her, as the Duke of Gordon's\r\ndaughter, while the pipes played a salute; but on her approaching the\r\n92nd, Cameron, still true to his old feud with her brother the marquis,\r\ngave the order--\"Gordon Highlanders, order arms--stand at ease!\" and\r\nthus coldly was the fair duchess received by the clan regiment of her\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th June, Napoleon left Paris at the head of his brave\r\narmy, and the British poured from Brussels. \"The 42nd and 92nd\r\nHighlanders marched through the Place Royale and the Parc,\" says\r\nthe \"Circumstantial Detail;\" \"one could not but admire their fine\r\nappearance, their steady, military demeanour, with their pipes playing\r\nbefore them, and the beams of the rising sun shining upon their\r\nglittering arms. On many a highland hill and in many a lowland valley\r\nwill the deeds of these brave men be remembered. It was impossible to\r\nwitness such a scene unmoved.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at four o'clock, on a bright midsummer morning, when the\r\nHighlanders of Pack's brigade marched through the Namur gate, and,\r\nmounted on a black Spanish horse, Fassifern was at the head of the\r\n92nd. Gallant MacQuarrie led the Royal Highlanders. They were in the\r\ndivision of Sir Thomas Picton, and, about two o'clock in the day,\r\ncame within range of the French artillery in front of Gemappe, near a\r\nfarm-house, now immortalised as _Les Quatre Bras_, where the main road\r\nfrom Charleroi to Brussels is crossed by that which leads from Nivelle\r\nto Namur. This was doomed to be, as his friend Mor'ar had, perhaps, too\r\nsurely foreseen, the scene of Cameron's last achievement.\r\n\r\nThe 92nd were ordered to line a ditch in front of the Namur road, on\r\nthe left flank of the farm-house; Wellington took his station near, and\r\na hot cannonade swept over them. The proud and fiery Cameron, still\r\npursuing his feud with the duke, never deigned to take the slightest\r\nnotice of him, but allowed him to pass and repass his post without\r\naccording either salute or recognising. At four in the afternoon the\r\nBlack Brunswick which failed in a charge in front of this position,\r\nand their brave prince fell by a mortal wound. Inspired with new\r\nardour, a body of French cavalry, which had taken the colours of the\r\n69th, or South Lincolnshire Regiment, swept forward, and then the\r\n92nd, the moment the Brunswickers were past, poured an oblique but\r\ndeadly volley upon the foe, piling men and horses breast high before\r\nthe roadway. Attended by one soldier, his servant, M. Bourgoyne, an\r\nofficer of these horse chasseurs, clad in light green uniform, tried\r\nto escape round the flank of the 92nd. His brass helmet had fallen\r\noff, and displayed his curly black hair; he was a handsome young man,\r\nand waved his sabre, repeatedly shouting \"_Vive l'Empereur_.\" Cameron\r\nevinced no disposition to molest this gallant Frenchman, but Wellington\r\nexclaimed, \"92nd, d----n it, do not let that fellow escape.\" Fifty or\r\nsixty men then fired at him; but, such was the speed of his horse, the\r\nsmoke, confusion, and inutility of firing with fixed bayonets, that he\r\nescaped all their shots, and caracoled his horse along the whole line\r\nof the 92nd. Then private Harold Chisholm, and a corporal of the 42nd\r\nHighlanders (who had lost his regiment and joined Cameron), unfixed\r\ntheir bayonets, knelt down, fired, and the chasseur fell to the earth,\r\nwhile his charger limped away on three legs. M. Bourgoyne had been\r\nshot through both ankles. Several Hanoverians now rushed forward to\r\nbayonet him, but he was rescued by Lieutenants Chisholm and Ewen Ross,\r\nwho had him borne to the rear. Lieutenant Hector Innes encountered his\r\nservant, who was run through from behind by a Belgian lancer and slain.\r\nM. Bourgoyne was afterwards sent to Brussels; and his family in Paris\r\nexpressed to Lieutenant Winchester, and other Highland officers, their\r\ndeep gratitude for his preservation.\r\n\r\nAgain the chasseurs charged, and again they were repulsed; while a\r\nfire of cannon and musket-shot was thinning fast the ranks of Cameron.\r\nForming under cover of these attacks, the French infantry, flanked by\r\nartillery, possessed themselves of a two-storied house, and in heavy\r\ncolumn advanced beyond it with great spirit. At that moment,\r\n\r\n\"92nd!\" exclaimed the Duke of Wellington, waving his cocked hat,\r\n\"prepare to charge.\"\r\n\r\nFassifern raised his bonnet, set spurs to his horse, the whole regiment\r\nsprang over the ditch which bounded the road, and with bayonets\r\ncharged, dashed through the smoke upon the enemy, and routed them.\r\nOfficers and men fell fast on every side; but on went the 92nd until\r\nthe gable of the two-storied house at the corner of the Charleroi road\r\nbroke the centre of their line. Then they formed up in two wings, rank\r\nentire, with the house in the centre; and Cameron sent forward his\r\ncousin Ewen Ross, with the light company, into a wood of olives to\r\nskirmish, where he received a severe wound in the groin. At that time\r\nthe grape-shot of the French artillery was sweeping the corn-field\r\nbetween the wood and the farm-house, and shredding away the ripe ears\r\nlike flakes of snow in the wind. A body of French, who occupied the\r\nupper story, were firing briskly from the windows; and others who lined\r\na thick thorn hedge, defended the avenues to the building.\r\n\r\nHere it was that the brave Cameron, of Fassifern, fell; but the\r\naccounts of his death, as related by Siborne and others, are not\r\nstrictly correct in detail. He had led his Highlanders close to the\r\nhedge, when a shot from the house passed through his belly, entering on\r\nthe left side, and passing out on the right, tearing the intestines,\r\nand inflicting a mortal wound. At the same moment his horse sank under\r\nhim, pierced by four musket balls.\r\n\r\nThe regiment gave a wild cheer, burst in the gates of the garden, and\r\nfearfully was he avenged by the charged bayonet and clubbed musket;\r\nbut ere this Captain William Grant, Lieutenants Chisholm, Becher, and\r\nM'Pherson were killed, and soon after were barbarously stripped by the\r\nFrench. Nineteen officers of the 92nd were wounded, and 280 rank and\r\nfile killed and wounded. The aged mother of Chisholm received a widow's\r\npension from the Government, and Campbell, the adjutant, brought his\r\nclaymore and watch home to her in Strathglass, as mementos of that dark\r\nday at Les Quatre Bras.\r\n\r\n\"The warlike and lamented Colonel Cameron,\" says his cousin Lieutenant\r\nEwen Ross (92nd), who was wounded on that day by his side, and whose\r\nletter is now before me, \"Cameron, than whom there was not a braver\r\nor better officer in the best or bravest of armies, was left to the\r\nchance care of his orderly sergeant, William Grant, who with a private\r\nof the 4th company led him carefully and slowly to a square of office\r\nhouses at Quatre Bras. His horse being perforated by four musket balls,\r\ncould carry him no further, and was then shot. The colonel was then\r\ncarried in a blanket to Gemappe by Sergeant Grant, Colin Mackenzie the\r\ndrum-major, two drummers named MacLean, and three MacRaes belonging to\r\nthe band.\"\r\n\r\nEwen M'Millan and another Highlander carried Cameron into what the\r\nsoldiers not inaptly named the _bloody hospital_ at Gemappe, where\r\nhis wound was at once pronounced to be mortal. On the position being\r\nabandoned, in his hereditary hatred and horror of the French, he\r\nexpressed great dread of being left to die in their hands; and by nine\r\nin the evening his faithful and sorrowing foster-brother procured a\r\ncommon cart, the only vehicle to be had, and placed him in it with\r\nEnsign Angus M'Donald, who was also severely wounded, and conveyed\r\nthem towards Brussels. On the way Cameron asked if the enemy had been\r\ndefeated? M'Millan answered \"yes,\" though such was not the case, but\r\nthe poor fellow's heart was ready to burst.\r\n\r\n\"Defeated--then I die happy!\" said Cameron; \"but, oh! I hope my dear\r\nnative country will believe that I have served her faithfully.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this the power of language failed him; but Angus M'Donald (who\r\nafterwards died from the effect of his own wound) related that he\r\nheard him praying fervently in Gaelic, and in whispers. He was sinking\r\nfast. As the cart passed near where his cousin Ross lay wounded, the\r\nlatter sent his servant, Angus Sutherland, to inquire how he was; but\r\nCameron's speech was gone--he could only shake his head mournfully,\r\nwithout replying; and just as the cart entered the village of Waterloo,\r\nhe laid his head on the breast of the brave and good M'Millan, on\r\nwhose arm he had reclined, and expired without a sigh.\r\n\r\nHis faithful follower conveyed the body in by the Namur gate, through\r\nwhich Cameron had that morning ridden forth at the head of his\r\nHighlanders, and took it straight to the billet they had occupied in\r\nBrussels. As he was obliged to rejoin the regiment without delay for\r\nthe coming conflict at Waterloo, he made a rough deal coffin, and in\r\nthis placed the body of his master, brother, and friend--for Cameron\r\nhad been all these three to the poor Highland private; and thus he\r\ninterred him, still in his full uniform, by the side of the King's\r\nAvenue, on the Ghent road, the Allée Verte. This was on the evening of\r\nSaturday, the 17th of June. The body was conveyed to its hastily-made\r\ntomb, in a common cart, for poor Ewen could afford nothing better; and\r\nthe only persons who accompanied him were the landlord of the billet,\r\nan honest Belgian, and three wounded Highlanders, who, with their open\r\nscars, had tottered out of Brussels to pay the last tribute to him they\r\nloved so well, and had followed so long.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordships will see in the enclosed lists,\" says Wellington, in\r\na dispatch to the Treasury, dated Orville, 25th June, \"the names of\r\nsome most valuable officers lost to His Majesty's service. Among them,\r\nI cannot avoid to mention Colonel Cameron, of the 92nd Regiment, and\r\nColonel Sir H. Ellis of the 23rd, to whose conduct I have frequently\r\ncalled your lordships' attention, and who at last fell, distinguishing\r\nthemselves at the head of the brave troops which they commanded.\r\nNotwithstanding the glory of the occasion, it is impossible not to\r\nlament such men, both on account of the public and as friends.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the eulogium of Wellington!\r\n\r\nWhen Cameron was lying dead in the hospital of Gemappe, there was\r\nfound in the pocket of his Highland regimentals a touching memento,\r\nillustrative of his character, and more honourable even than the\r\ntrophies of battle which he bore on his breast; viz., a pocket-book,\r\ncontaining the names of all the Highland soldiers who had come with\r\nhim from his father's lands and from Lochaber; marking those whom he\r\nhad promoted, and those who were dead; for he counted many of them as\r\nhis clansmen and kindred, and had ever looked after the interests and\r\nwelfare of them all as if they had been the children of his own hearth,\r\nand he had carried this list with him in all his battles, for it was\r\ndated at Alexandria, in Egypt, 24th September, 1801.\r\n\r\nA captain of an English regiment was buried near him; and there in\r\nthat lonely place the graves lay undisturbed until the month of April,\r\n1816. In that year the colonel's brother, Captain Peter Cameron, of the\r\nBalcarris, came to Brussels, accompanied by Ewen M'Millan, who led him\r\nto the well-remembered place, where the graves lay, near three trees at\r\na corner of the Allée Verte. The colonel's remains were exhumed, placed\r\nwithin another coffin, and brought to Leith; from whence a king's ship\r\nconveyed them to his native Lochaber, where a grand Highland funeral\r\nwas prepared.\r\n\r\nFrom Fassifern the remains of the colonel were borne for five miles,\r\non the shoulders of his friends and clansmen, to the old kirkyard of\r\nKilmalie, where, in presence of 3000 Highlanders, his aged father, then\r\nverging on his eightieth year, laid his head in the grave a second\r\ntime, while the pipes played a lament; and now he sleeps in his native\r\nearth by the tomb of the MacLauchlans, the _Leine Chrios_ of Locheil.\r\nDonald Cameron, his chief, was in attendance, with Barra, Barcaldine,\r\nand Glencoe, and seventy gentlemen of the clans dined in honour of the\r\noccasion, at the Inn of Maryburgh.\r\n\r\nOld Highlanders yet tell how sadly and how solemnly on that day the\r\nmarch of _Gille Chriosd_ rang in the great glen of Caledonia, and yet\r\nremember the dirge composed on that occasion by _Ailean Dall_, or\r\n\"Blind Allan,\" the bard of the chieftain of Glengarry--perhaps the last\r\nof the family bards in the Scottish Highlands.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of his son's brilliant services, the venerable Ewen\r\nof Fassifern received a baronetcy, and in Kilmalie a monument has been\r\nraised above the grave of the hero of Arriverette. Its epitaph is from\r\nthe pen of Sir Walter Scott, and is remarkable for the elegance of its\r\nexpression:--\r\n\r\n\"Sacred to the memory of Colonel John Cameron, eldest son of Ewen\r\nCameron of Fassifern, Bart., whose mortal remains, transported from the\r\nfield of glory where he died, rest here with those of his forefathers.\r\nDuring twenty years of active military service, with a spirit which\r\nknew no fear, and shunned no danger, he accompanied or led, in marches,\r\nsieges, and battles, the 92nd Regiment of Scottish Highlanders, always\r\nto honour and always to victory; and at length, in the 42nd year of his\r\nage, upon the memorable 16th June, 1815, was slain in command of that\r\ncorps, while actively contributing to achieve the decisive victory of\r\nWaterloo, which gave peace to Europe. Thus closing his military career\r\nwith the long and eventful struggle, in which his services had been so\r\noften distinguished; he _died_, lamented by that unrivalled general,\r\nto whose long train of success he had so often contributed; by his\r\ncountry, from which he had repeatedly received marks of the highest\r\nconsideration, and by his sovereign, who graced his surviving family\r\nwith those marks of honour which could not follow, to this place, him\r\nwhom they were designed to commemorate. _Reader, call not his fate\r\nuntimely, who, thus honoured and lamented, closed a life of fame by a\r\ndeath of glory!_\"\r\n\r\nFew of Camerons old comrades now survive. I know of only three officers\r\nand four privates living of the regiment which, between the 27th\r\nAugust, 1799, and the 18th June, 1815, had lost, in killed and wounded,\r\n117 officers and 1634 men. After being discharged, Ewen M'Millan (who\r\ncould never learn one word of English) died, in 1840, at Callart, the\r\nseat of Cameron's brother, and he now sleeps by his old master's side\r\nat Kilmalie. He it is whose memory Scott has embalmed in his \"_Dance of\r\nDeath_,\" and--\r\n\r\n               \"Who for many a day\r\n Had followed stout and stern,\r\n Where through battles, rout, and reel,\r\n Storm of shot and hedge of steel,\r\n Led the grandson of Lochiel,\r\n               Valiant Fassifern!\r\n\r\n Though steel and shot he leads no more,\r\n Low laid 'mid friends' and foemen's gore\r\n But long his native lake's wild shore,\r\n And Suinart rough, and high Ardgower,\r\n               And Morven long and tell;\r\n\r\n And proud Bennevis hear with awe,\r\n How, upon Bloody Quatre Bras,\r\n Brave Cameron heard the wild hurrah\r\n               Of conquest, as he fell!\"\r\n\r\nRiddled with wounds, Colonel Donald M'Donald of Inch, Knight of St.\r\nVladimir, died in 1830, and is interred at Edinburgh; Lieutenant\r\nWinchester died there in 1846. Captain Campbell died, by leaping\r\nover a window, with a pistol in each hand, to chastise a person who\r\nhad insulted him; some have died as emigrants among the wilds of the\r\nfar West; many more are lying near Uppark, in Jamaica, where the\r\nclose-ranked headstones show where 1300 of the Gordon Highlanders are\r\nsleeping far from their native hills; and now Paymaster Gordon, and\r\nLieutenants Ewen Ross, John Grant, and Alexander Gordon alone survive\r\nto wear the _war decoration_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: As an example of the number of _officers_ belonging to\r\nthe clans, who served during the war and escaped its slaughter, we\r\nmay state that there were on full and half-pay commissions, in 1816,\r\n22 Buchanans; 67 Camerons; 22 Drummonds; 26 Fergusons; 41 Forbeses;\r\n49 Grahames; 90 Frazers; 96 Grants; 144 M'Leans and M'Kenzies; 248\r\nCampbells; and other names in the same proportion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: MS.

In 1759 he served with\r\nthe fleet of Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, C.B. (afterwards Lord Hawke),\r\nwhen blockading the harbour of Brest, where a fine French fleet lay,\r\nunder the pennant of the Marquis de Conflans. At that time a double\r\ninvasion of Britain (one by the way of Scotland, the other on the coast\r\nof England) was threatened; but Commodore Boys blocked up Dunkirk,\r\nand Rodney bombarded Havre-de-Grace, while the French transports and\r\nflat-bottomed boats lay inactive in Brest, with the fleet of M. de\r\nConflans; till a violent storm in autumn, having driven the ships of\r\nSir Edward Hawke into Torbay, the marquis put to sea with twenty-one\r\nsail of the line and four frigates, and threw all England into\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\nWith twenty sail of the line, Hawke left Torbay, and came up with the\r\nFrench fleet between Belleisle and Cape Quiberon, close in on the\r\ncoast of France, and in the desperate conflict which ensued, \"young\r\nGreig,\" though a subaltern, is said to \"have eminently distinguished\r\nhimself.\" The battle began at two o'clock, P.M., on the 20th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nSir Edward, in the _Royal George_, 110, lay alongside De Conflans in\r\nthe _Soleil Royale_, 80, which was soon driven on shore and burned.\r\nHe then lay alongside the _Thesée_, and sent her to the bottom by one\r\nbroadside. _La Superbe_ shared the same fate; the _Juste_ was sunk\r\noff the mouth of the Loire; the _Hero_ was burned; and thus M. de\r\nConflans was totally defeated. Nothing saved the rest of his fleet from\r\nirretrievable ruin but the shadow of a tempestuous night, in which\r\ntwo British ships of the line were lost. Lieutenant Greig served with\r\nthe fleet in all its operations, during the long cruise off the coast\r\nof Bretagne, and the blockade of the river Vilaine, to prevent seven\r\nFrench ships which lay there from joining Conflans, whose battered\r\nsquadron had reached Rochefort; but so dangerous were the storms, and\r\nso incessantly tempestuous the weather, that the fear of invasion\r\npassed away. Sir Edward Hawke was at length recalled, and the thanks\r\nof Parliament and a pension were awarded to him. In this war the\r\nBritish destroyed, or took twenty-seven French ships of the line and\r\nthirty-one frigates. Six of their vessels perished. Thus, in all they\r\nlost sixty-four sail, while Britain, by every casualty, lost only seven\r\nline-of-battle ships and five frigates.\r\n\r\nThe next scene of Greig's service was at the capture of several of the\r\nWest India Islands.\r\n\r\nWar having been declared against the Spaniards, an attack on their\r\nsettlements in the West Indies was arranged, and Martinico, St. Lucia,\r\nSt. Vincent, and Grenada were taken. Then Cuba was assailed. Greig\r\nwas with the fleet, consisting of nineteen sail of the line, eighteen\r\nfrigates, and 150 transports, which had 10,000 soldiers on board, and\r\nsailed for Cuba under Admiral Sir George Pocoke, K.B., whose commodore\r\nwas the Hon. Augustus Keppel, raised to the peerage in 1782.\r\n\r\nThe energy and exertions of Lieutenant Greig, during that tremendous\r\ncannonading which preceded the siege and capture of the Moro Castle,\r\nelicited the praise of his commander; but no promotion followed, for\r\nthe time was unfavourable for either Scotsmen or Irishmen rising in the\r\nBritish service. After incredible exertions, difficulties, danger, and\r\nslaughter, Havannah was captured, with 180 miles of coast; the Puntal\r\nCastle, the ships in the harbour, three millions sterling of booty, and\r\nan immense quantity of arms, artillery, and stores were surrendered to\r\nthe British. Greig's share of this enormous prize-money was very small,\r\nbeing somewhere about 80_l._\r\n\r\nLieutenant Greig served in many other engagements during that\r\nsuccessful war; and his bravery, activity, and skill as a seaman had\r\nso frequently elicited particular attention, that after the treaty of\r\npeace which was signed at Paris in February, 1763, under Lord Bute's\r\nadministration, when the Court of St. Petersburg requested that a few\r\nBritish officers of distinguished ability might be sent to improve the\r\nRussian fleet, Greig was one of the _five_ who were first selected,\r\nand his rank as lieutenant in the navy of Russia was confirmed by the\r\nEmpress Catherine II., in 1764. The only stipulation he and the others\r\nmade was, that they were to have the power of returning to the British\r\nservice whenever they chose.\r\n\r\nRussia, since the beginning of the seventeenth century, has ever been\r\nan excellent field for Scottish talent and valour. Thus Greig, by\r\nhis superior skill in naval affairs, his intelligence and diligent\r\ndischarge of the duties entrusted to him, soon attracted the special\r\nnotice of the Imperial Government, and the Empress appointed him a\r\ncaptain in her fleet. He drew many other Scotsmen around him, and,\r\nwith these, he was at incredible pains to teach the half-barbarous\r\nand wholly unlettered Russians the science of seamanship and the art\r\nof gunnery, in all of which they were very deficient, \"and he rapidly\r\nraised the Russian naval service to a degree of respectability and\r\nimportance which it never before had attained.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1769, when he was in his thirty-fourth year, a war broke out between\r\nRussia and Turkey, consequent on the civil strife which religious\r\nintolerance had kindled in Poland. The Czarina marched in her troops;\r\nand while pretending that her sole object was to rescue one body of\r\nPolish citizens from the tyranny of the other, she secretly sought to\r\nenslave them all, and render their country a province of the Russian\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe growing greatness of the latter had alarmed its old hereditary\r\nenemy, the Grand Seignior, who required Catherine immediately to\r\nwithdraw her troops from the Polish republic. Evasions were given,\r\nand conflicts began between the Russian and Turkish outposts, on the\r\nborders of the Ottoman empire, until the sack of Balta, in Lesser\r\nTartary, and a general massacre of its inhabitants, by the soldiers of\r\nthe Czarina, procured the committal of her ambassador to the Castle of\r\nthe Seven Towers, in October, 1769; and hostilities, which were only\r\nsuspended by the rigour of the season, began early in the spring of the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nCaptain Greig was appointed commodore of the fleet which was to sail\r\nfor the Mediterranean, under Alexis Count Orloff; and in that ample\r\narena of service he had an opportunity of displaying his zeal and\r\nintrepidity in such a manner as led to his immediate promotion to the\r\nrank of flag-officer.\r\n\r\nA partial breaking up of the ice in the Baltic enabled some of the\r\nfleet to sail; and so early as the 14th of January, 1770, one part of\r\nthe armament, under the Scottish admiral Elphinstone, consisting of\r\none 70-gun ship, two of sixty guns each, and five others, arrived at\r\nSpithead, _en route_ for the Archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe other division, of twenty-two sail of the line, reached Port\r\nMahon, in Minorca, so early as the 4th of January; and by the 6th of\r\nMarch appeared off Cephalonia, the largest of the Ionian Isles, and,\r\nwith a fair wind, bore away directly for the Morea. At Minorca they\r\nleft some vessels to wait for Elphinstone, who left Spithead on the\r\n14th of April, passed Gibraltar on the 4th of May, and before the\r\nend of July had twice defeated the Turkish fleet--on one occasion\r\nencountering three times his force, and destroying eight ships; on the\r\nsecond occasion, with nineteen ships, encountering Giafar Bey, with\r\ntwenty-three. Giafar's largest ships were destroyed, and his fleet\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nIn the great battle of the 6th of July, Greig, Mackenzie, and other\r\nofficers in the Russian fleet, had an opportunity of eminently\r\nrendering good and gallant service; and by their energy and skill\r\nthe world now saw a naval force, which, as Cormick says, had issued\r\nfrom the foot of the Baltic, able \"to shake the remotest parts of the\r\nMediterranean, to intercept the trade of the Levant, to excite and\r\nsupport the insurrection of the Greek Christians, and to leave nothing\r\nof the vast empire of their enemies free from alarm and confusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe united squadron of the Admirals Count Orloff, Elphinstone,\r\nSpiritoff, and Commodore Greig, followed the Turkish fleet, which\r\nconsisted of fifteen sail of the line, twelve frigates, &c., into the\r\nChannel of Scio, which divides the island from Anadoli, or the Lesser\r\nAsia; there the Turks were at anchor in a most advantageous position,\r\nat the foot of the Gulf of Liberno, where their rear and flanks were\r\nprotected by rocks.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 5th, Commodore Greig was sent to\r\nreconnoitre the roads between Scio and the main; and in the afternoon\r\nhe signalled _the enemy in sight_, consisting of _thirty sail in all_.\r\nOrloff, the admiral-general, held a council of war, at which Greig's\r\nopinion was specially asked, and his advice followed.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th, at ten in the morning, Orloff signalled to form line, and\r\nthe Russian fleet approached the Turks. Orloff was in the centre, with\r\nthree _Birnates_; Commodore Greig led one division, and Elphinstone the\r\nother--in all, ten sail of the line, and five frigates; and they each\r\nbore down with ensigns flying, all their ports open, and decks cleared\r\nfor action. There were many French officers on board of the Turkish\r\nfleet, which had been joined by about thirty lieutenants, who had\r\nreceived the permission of King Louis to enter the Sultan's service. A\r\nterrible scene of carnage ensued, and the whole conflict is admirably\r\ndetailed in a letter published in the _Scots' Magazine_ for that\r\nyear, by a Lieutenant Mackenzie, who served on board of her Imperial\r\nMajesty's ship the _Switostoff_.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock the battle began. Admiral Spiritoff ranged up\r\nalongside of the Turkish admiral, who was in the _Sultana_, of ninety\r\nbrass guns, and thus they fought yard-arm and yard-arm together,\r\npouring in and receiving cannon-shot, chain-shot, hand-grenades and\r\nmusketry. Spiritoff's topmasts were shot away, his bulwarks battered\r\ndown, and blood ran from his scuppers into the sea. He led his sailors\r\nin an attempt to board the _Sultana_, and tore the banner of the\r\nCrescent from her stern; but the boarders were repulsed, and obliged\r\nto sheer off, for the Turk took fire, and his burning mainmast fell\r\non board of Spiritoff's ship, which also became wrapped in flames;\r\nand in ten minutes both ships blew up. \"I leave you to judge,\" says\r\nMackenzie, \"of the dreadful scene of seeing so many hundreds of poor\r\nsouls blown into the air, while the rest were hotly engaged.\" Spiritoff\r\nand twenty-four officers saved themselves in the barge.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Turkish fleet, after being severely mauled by\r\nElphinstone and Greig (Orloff was little of a seaman), cut their\r\ncables, and ran into the harbour of Chismeh, a small town in the Sanjak\r\nof Siglah, at the bottom of a bay one mile broad, and two miles long.\r\nAcross the mouth of this bay the fleet, under Orloff, Elphinstone, and\r\nthe Commodore, lay for the whole night, firing round shot, and throwing\r\nin bombs. The fire of Greig's ship was particularly destructive; but\r\non the Turks getting batteries established on the height between Scio\r\nand the coast of Anadoli, he and the two admirals were obliged to haul\r\noff. Two fireships were prepared an the 7th, under the direction of\r\nElphinstone and Greig; and a council of war was held by the principal\r\nofficers in the cabin of Count Orloff. It was there suggested by the\r\nCommodore, and resolved upon, that at midnight four ships of the\r\nline, two frigates, and the bomb-ketch, should enter the harbour,\r\nand while attacking the enemy, send the fireships on their errand of\r\ndestruction; but volunteers were required to lead, and three officers,\r\nall Scotsmen, at once stepped forward. These were, Commodore Greig,\r\nLieutenant Mackenzie, of the _Switostoff_, and Captain-Lieutenant\r\nDrysdale (or Dugdale, for this officer is called alternately by both\r\nnames in many accounts of these wars), and they made every preparation\r\nfor the desperate duty before them. At half-past twelve at night the\r\nsignal was made to weigh anchor, and bear into the little bay; Drysdale\r\nand Mackenzie had the fireships; Greig led the ships of the line and\r\nthe two frigates, which, at four hundred yards' distance, cannonaded\r\nthe Turks, while the bomb-ketch plied its mortars. Greig signalled\r\nthe fireships to bear down; Drysdale and Mackenzie answered it, and,\r\nfavoured by the wind, ran right into the teeth of the Turks, whose\r\ncentre ship was at that moment set on fire by a fortunate shot from the\r\nCommodore.\r\n\r\nDrysdale's crew unfortunately left his ship before the proper time.\r\nIndeed, the Russians were so overcome with terror by the darkness of\r\nthe night, the boom of the Turkish shot, and by the fireships, of which\r\nthey were unable to comprehend the use, that it was only by dint of his\r\nsword and pistols that Drysdale kept them to their duty; but when near\r\nthe enemy the helmsman abandoned the rudder, the whole crew sprang into\r\ntheir boat, and abandoned the brave Scotsman on board of the fireship!\r\n\r\nIn this terrible situation his native courage never deserted him; he\r\nlashed the helm, and (though a boat full of armed Turks was pulling\r\nalongside) held the ship on her course till, with his own unaided\r\nhands, he hooked the grapnel-irons to the anchor-cable of the nearest\r\nship, which proved to be a large caravella. He then fired the train\r\nby discharging a pistol, and in doing so was severely scorched by the\r\nexplosion. At the moment the Turks boarded him on one side he sprang\r\ninto the sea from the other, and swam from the blazing ship. Many a\r\nshot was fired after him, but he escaped, and was saved with difficulty\r\nby the boats of Greig.\r\n\r\nThe fireships blew up with the most admirable effect, and the result\r\nwas, beyond Greig's utmost expectations, decisive and disastrous, for\r\nin five hours the whole Turkish fleet was burned to the water-edge\r\nand totally destroyed--all, save one ship, Giafar Bey's, of seventy\r\nguns, four row-galleys, and some gilt barges of twenty-four oars. The\r\nmorning sun, as he shone upon the Isle of Scio and Anadolian shore, saw\r\na scene of unexampled devastation--every Turkish mast had vanished from\r\nthe bay, and pieces of charred and floating wreck alone remained! The\r\nfollowing were the ships destroyed by Greig:--\r\n\r\n Capitan Alebi, 84 guns.\r\n Bashaw, 90 guns.\r\n Patrona Ayckrece, 80 guns.\r\n Reala Mustapha, 96 guns.\r\n Mulensi Achmet, 84 guns.\r\n Emir Mustapha, 84 guns.\r\n Achmet, 86 guns.\r\n Hamisi, 60 guns.\r\n Ali Randioto, 60 guns.\r\n Melehin, 80 guns.\r\n Rapislan Bashaw, 64 guns.\r\n Zefirbe, 84 guns.\r\n\r\n_La Barbarocine_, 64 guns, was towed out of the harbour by his boats.\r\nTwo other large ships (names unknown) were burned, with four frigates,\r\neight 40-gun ships, eight galleys, and several row-boats. He rescued\r\n400 Christian slaves, hauled close in shore, bombarded the town, blew\r\nup the castle, and reduced the whole place to a heap of rubbish before\r\nnine o'clock in the morning, by which time more than 6000 Turks had\r\nbeen shot, burned, or drowned.\r\n\r\nFor this brilliant service Greig was at once made a rear-admiral by\r\nCount Orloff, while Lieutenants Drysdale and Mackenzie received the\r\nrank of captain, all of which appointments the Empress was pleased\r\nto confirm. Though the unfortunate Capitan Pacha, who commanded, was\r\nseverely wounded, the Sultan ordered his head to be struck off, and\r\nappointed Giafar Bey admiral in his place. As rear-admiral Greig's pay\r\namounted to 2160 roubles per annum. Immediately after this victory\r\nAdmiral Elphinstone sailed with his squadron for the Isle of Tenedos,\r\nto block up the Dardanelles, where he captured forty vessels destined\r\nfor Constantinople, forced most of the Isles of the Archipelago to\r\ndeclare for Russia, and levied contributions everywhere, taxing\r\nMitylene in 150,000 piastres. Greig accompanied Count Orloff to the\r\nliege of the Castle of Lemnos, which proceeded slowly, the only troops\r\nthey had being revolted Greeks, who were afterwards cut to pieces by\r\nHassan Bey, and then the Russians bent all their efforts to force the\r\npassage of the Dardanelles; but so strongly was it fortified by the\r\nChevalier Tott, and other Frenchmen, that every attempt proved futile.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1770 Greig's commission was further confirmed by a\r\nletter from the Empress, and in his ship, the _Three Primates_, he\r\nbrought the nominal commander-in-chief, Count Orloff, to Leghorn on the\r\n7th of December, as the fleet was leaving the Archipelago for want of\r\nmen, and the batteries of the Dardanelles were daily becoming stronger\r\nunder the skilful eye of Tott, to whom the grateful Sultan paid 100\r\nscudi daily, as the saviour of his capital.\r\n\r\nAt Leghorn the Sieur Rutherford, Commissary of the Russian Court, sold\r\nall the prizes taken by the fleet. Having secret views of his own\r\nconcerning the unfortunate Princess Tarakanoff, the Count Orloff, who\r\nis styled minister plenipotentiary, general of the Russian troops,\r\nand admiral-general, proposed to spend the winter partly at Pisa, and\r\npartly at Leghorn, \"in order to take care of the Russian squadron,\" as\r\npeace was expected. Greig is said to have demurred; Admiral Elphinstone\r\nexpressed dissatisfaction, and when ordered to sail on \"a secret\r\nexpedition\" he bluntly declined. An altercation ensued between him\r\nand the count. He was put under arrest, and reported to the Empress,\r\nwho recalled him, and he retired from her service in disgust. On his\r\npresentation to Catherine he appeared in the blue uniform of the\r\nBritish navy, on which she turned coldly away, saying to one of her\r\nfavourites, \"It is high time this Scot was out of my service, when he\r\nhas laid aside my uniform!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fleet was not inactive, for Mackenzie, Brodie, and other\r\nofficers, who served under Spiritoff, were very zealous. Thus, by the\r\n20th January, 1771, they had destroyed nineteen Dulcignotte tartans,\r\nand exacted from the Isles of the Archipelago the same tribute which\r\nthey yearly paid the Sultan. At the same time the Russian troops had\r\ntaken the city of Sinope, on the Black Sea, the fortress of Giurgievo,\r\nand other places in the Turkish provinces. A squadron, commanded by\r\nthe Knights of Malta, joined Orloff's flag; Scio was again ravaged by\r\nthe Russians, a large dulcignotte destroyed, and the fighting among\r\nthe fertile and beautiful isles of Greece was incessant; Greig was\r\nconstantly employed, and daily added to his reputation as a brave and\r\nskilful officer.\r\n\r\nHe had assisted in the destruction of all the magazines which had been\r\nformed to supply the Turkish capital; at the bombardment of Negropont,\r\nthe capital of the ancient Euboea, where the troops were landed to\r\ndestroy the stores of corn and flour; he had cruised along the shore\r\nof Macedonia; been at the bombardment of Cavalla in Romelia, and\r\nthe destruction of the storehouses at Salonica; and in the Gulf of\r\nKassanderah, while Count Theodore, the brother of Count Alexis Orloff,\r\nscoured all the shores of Anadoli, and cannonaded Rhodez. The united\r\nRussian fleet, under the three admirals, Orloff, Spiritoff, and Greig,\r\nmade sixty-six sail in all on the 1st of November.\r\n\r\nWhile the Russian army by land was making daily successful attacks\r\non the Turks, and had crossed the Danube under General Romanzow, and\r\ntwice besieged Silistria, pushing the war round the shores of the\r\nBlack Sea, and into the Crimea, the naval squadrons had many desperate\r\nencounters in the Archipelago, and one very sharp action off the Isle\r\nof Scio, when seven Russian ships of the line and two frigates engaged\r\nten Turkish ships and six large galleys, on the 10th of October, 1773,\r\nand after fighting from ten in the morning until long past mid-day,\r\nentirely defeated them, taking five sail, sinking two, and putting the\r\nrest to flight. In one of these encounters a ball struck Admiral Greig,\r\nand bent one of the points of his cross of St. George, carrying away\r\na piece of the enamel. Every captain of the Russian navy then wore\r\nthe military order of St. George, the badge of which is a knight and\r\ndragon, attached to a black ribbon.\r\n\r\nA descent was made upon the Isle of Cyprus; another on Candia, and\r\nelsewhere; but the Russians were repulsed, and four sacks filled with\r\ntheir _scalps_ were sent from Stanchio as a proof of the reception\r\nthey had met with in that island.\r\n\r\nIn the end of 1773 Greig returned to St. Petersburg, and, with Admiral\r\nSir Charles Knowles, made every exertion to have a better and more\r\nefficient squadron dispatched to the Dardanelles. With this under\r\nhis command he sailed again from Cronstadt, and after touching at\r\nPortsmouth, bore on for the Mediterranean on the 17th of February,\r\n1774. With his flag flying as vice-admiral, he reached Leghorn,\r\nwhere, for purposes of his own, Alexis Orloff was again loitering.\r\nOn this expedition Greig was accompanied by his wife, for whom every\r\naccommodation had been made in his ship, the _Issidorum_; but being of\r\ncourse unwilling that she should risk the dangers of the Turkish war,\r\nhe landed her at Leghorn, where the house of the Russian consul was\r\nassigned to her as a residence. The ships composing his fleet were--\r\n\r\n The Issidorum, 74 guns             Captain Surminoff.\r\n The Mironfitz, 74 guns             Captain Mouskin Pouskin.\r\n St. Alexander Newski, 64 guns      Captain Voronari.\r\n Demetrius Douski, 64 guns          Captain Pajaskoff.\r\n St. Paulus, 30 guns                Captain Palovski.\r\n\r\nDuring Greig's brief sojourn at Leghorn there occurred one of those\r\natrocities which so frequently blackened the reign of Catherine II.\r\n\r\nAlexis Count Orloff, a man of the most inhuman character and brutal\r\npropensities, had conceived a passion for the young and beautiful\r\nPrincess Tarakanoff, daughter of the late Empress Elizabeth, by her\r\nclandestine marriage with the Grand Veneur. This princess had been\r\nconveyed to Rome by the artful Prince Radzivil, beyond the reach\r\nof Catherine's intrigues and tyranny. But Orloff had been ordered\r\nto _decoy her back_ to St. Petersburg on the first opportunity.\r\nAccordingly, during one of his visits to Leghorn, he laid a snare for\r\nher, by sending an Italian, named Signor Ribas, afterwards a Knight of\r\nMalta, to visit her. This vile person, who found the poor princess in\r\na mean lodging, told her that he \"had come to pay homage to her beauty\r\nand misfortunes, and to deplore the destitution in which he found\r\nher.\" He then offered her money, adding that he \"was commissioned by\r\nAlexis Orloff to promise her the throne her mother had filled, and\r\nat the same time his sincere love, if she would honour him with her\r\nhand.\" After some hesitation she was overcome by the apparent sincerity\r\nand brilliance of the proposal, which seemed the more splendid by her\r\ndestitute condition, and accepted the offer of Orloff. He visited her\r\nrepeatedly; a feigned marriage was performed by two Russian officers,\r\ndisguised as Catholic priests; villainy completed the imposture: for\r\na time--two or three months--he placed her in a magnificent palace\r\nat Pisa, and then brought her to Leghorn. It was at this crisis\r\nthat Admiral Greig entered the port, and his wife[9] is mentioned\r\nas being among the first to visit the young princess, who was far\r\nfrom suspecting the terrible snare laid for her--a snare of which\r\nthe _English_ consul is said to have been cognizant. Deluded by the\r\ncaresses and feigned love of Orloff, she begged to be \"shown the large\r\nand beautiful ships of the Russian fleet,\" which was ordered to prepare\r\nfor her reception.\r\n\r\nOn her arriving at the beach, she was placed by Orloff in a handsome\r\nboat, screened by a silken awning; the second barge conveyed the\r\nvice-admiral and other British officers, who for many years after were\r\nall unconscious of the villainy of Orloff. Music, huzzas, and salutes\r\nof artillery welcomed the unhappy daughter of the Empress Elizabeth on\r\nboard the nearest ship; and the moment she stood upon its deck, she\r\nwas _handcuffed_ with heavy irons, and thrust into one of the lowest\r\ncabins. She threw herself at the feet of Orloff, and implored pity as\r\n_his wife_; but was answered by laughter and mockery, while the anchor\r\nwas weighed, and the ship sailed for St. Petersburg, where she was shut\r\nup in a fortress on the Neva, and was _never heard of again_!\r\n\r\nRumour adds a darker tinge to this tale of Russian cruelty, by\r\nasserting that, two years afterwards, when the waters of the Neva rose\r\nten feet by an inundation, they filled the horrid vault in which she\r\nwas confined, and drowned her. Her body was then flung into the stream,\r\nand swept by its current into the Gulf of Finland.\r\n\r\nBut to return. As the wind continued fair, Greig bore away for Paros,\r\na beautiful isle of the central Cyclades, which was the rendezvous of\r\nthe fleet under Spiritoff, and where a great many small vessels of an\r\nentirely new construction, were prepared for the purpose of embarking\r\nand landing troops.\r\n\r\nHere the Russians had seized and sold a number of Venetian ships,\r\nconsequently the senate ordered all their vessels of war to be prepared\r\nto resist the new armament of Greig, and in March rigged two ships of\r\n84 guns each, and two more of 75: these ultimately came to blows with\r\nthe Turks, and defeated them off the Isle of Candia.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of March, tidings having come to Paros that the Turkish\r\nfleet were about to surprise the Russian garrison at Sciros, a 50-gun\r\nship and four frigates were despatched to oppose the attempt, but\r\nsignally failed--for they were all burned or taken but one. The general\r\nhead-quarters of the Czarina's forces were at the Isle of Paros; and\r\nthere, during the spring of 1774, the Admirals Spiritoff and Greig\r\nanchored their armaments at Port Naussa, on the northern shore--one\r\nof the finest harbours in the Archipelago, and in the channel between\r\nParos and the bold and lofty coast of Naxos. Their regular troops\r\noccupied Marmora and Zimbido, while their Albanian allies were at\r\nBachia. Greig and Spiritoff made every effort to refit the old ships,\r\nand prepare them for hostilities in summer, and when their cruisers\r\njoined them from Patmos and Tasso; but before anything of importance\r\nwas achieved, the Empress concluded a peace with the Turks--a peace,\r\nsays Frederick the Great, \"resplendent with glory, by the success which\r\nher arms had met with against her enemies during the war;\" and by this\r\npeace, the treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardgi, Catherine stipulated that the\r\nCrimea, which had hitherto been under the subjection of the Turks,\r\nshould be, in all time coming, an independent sovereignty under its\r\nown khans, thus lessening the power of the Porte.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Greig now returned to Russia with the fleet, and for many years\r\ndevoted himself entirely to the improvement of the Russian marine, and\r\nthe development of the naval resources of the Empire--remodelling its\r\ncode of discipline, relaxing its barbarity, civilizing and educating\r\nits officers and men, by training the marine cadets on board of two\r\nfrigates or floating academies, and thus justly earning for himself the\r\nhonourable and endearing sobriquet of the _Father of the Russian Navy_.\r\nFor these and other valuable services the grateful Empress bestowed\r\nupon him the government of Cronstadt, and a commission as High Admiral\r\nof all the Russias, at the same time decorating him with the Orders\r\nof St. Andrew, St. George of the second class, St. Vladimir, which\r\nshe instituted on the 22nd September, 1782 (her twentieth coronation\r\nday), and St. Anne of Holstein, which is always the gift of the Grand\r\nDuke. His great assistant was Mr. Gordon, director-general of the\r\nship-building, who at one time had building, under his own immediate\r\ncare, two ships of 100 guns each, three of 90 guns each, six of 70\r\nguns each, and ten of 40 guns each--all of which, for their skilful\r\nconstruction, strength, swiftness, and beauty of mould, had never been\r\nequalled by any previous effort of Russian naval architecture.\r\n\r\nThe admiral's pay was now 7000 roubles per annum.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the custom of the Russian nobility, who add the\r\nChristian name of their father to their own, with the termination\r\n_owitch_, which signifies _the son of_, we find the Scottish admiral\r\nsigning and designating himself \"Samuel Carlovitch Greig.\" He was ever\r\ntreated with the greatest consideration and honour by the Empress, who,\r\nin the year 1776, paid him the compliment of a visit--then esteemed\r\nan unparalleled act of condescension for the crowned head of Russia,\r\nwho, among many absurd and hyperbolical titles, had (and perhaps still\r\nretains) the blasphemous one of \"Chamberlain to Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of July the Empress, attended by all the great officers of\r\nher state and household, went in a magnificent barge from Oranienbaum\r\nto Admiral Greig's ship, the yards of which he had manned. As soon as\r\nhe had handed her on board, the Imperial standard was hoisted, and the\r\nwhole fleet fired a salute, which was responded to by _nine hundred_\r\npieces of cannon in Cronstadt. Dinner was set in Greig's cabin for the\r\nEmpress and a hundred guests, who were the principal officers of her\r\nmarine and other departments. The whole fleet then weighed anchor, and\r\nCatherine, accompanied by the infamous Orloff, Field-Marshal Count\r\nGalitzin, and Count Bruce, the adjutant on duty, was rowed in her barge\r\nalong the line amid another salute of cannon. Before returning to\r\nOranienbaum she placed on Greig's breast the golden and eight-pointed\r\nstar of St. Alexander Newski, with the red ribbon, which is worn over\r\nthe left shoulder.\r\n\r\nDuring the peace, Greig was unremitting in his efforts to draw British\r\nofficers into the service, and the number who offered their swords\r\nand valour to the Czarina soon conduced, by their skill and talent,\r\nto render her navy for the first time respectable and formidable in\r\nEurope.[10]\r\n\r\nThus it was that, in 1799, in Lord Duncan's line of battle, August\r\n24th, at the Texel, we find among the Russian ships of war, the\r\n_Ratisvan_, commanded by Captain Greig; and in September, under the\r\nsame gallant admiral, the Scottish captains Scott, Dunn, Boyle,\r\nMaclagan, Ogilvie, and Rose, commanding the Russian ships _Alexander\r\nNewski_, 74; _Neptune_, 54; _Rafaill_, 44; _Revel_, 44; _Minerva_,\r\n38; and _St. Nicholas_, 38, embarking the Russian troops at Revel;\r\nand thus it was, that when Russia, fifteen years before, projected a\r\nnew war against the Turks, in consequence of their interference with\r\nthe affairs of the independent Crimea, the Empress found her fleet to\r\nconsist of upwards of ninety sail at Cronstadt, Revel, and in the Sea\r\nof Asoph.\r\n\r\nBy the 11th of October, 1783, Admiral Greig had ready a fleet for the\r\nMediterranean consisting of twelve sail of the line--viz., one of 76\r\nguns, two of 74, three of 70, four of 64, two of 60, four frigates,\r\na sloop, three store-ships, two fireships, two bomb-ketches, and\r\ntwo galleys. The vice-admiral of this fine armament was his old\r\nbrother-officer, who had shared with him the glory of that night's\r\ndesperate work in the Bay of Chismeh. All these ships were in the best\r\ncondition, and British officers were judiciously distributed among\r\nthem; but the poor Khan of the Crimea, Sahim Gueray--the last of the\r\nlineal descendants of the far-famed Ghengiz Khan--abdicated his power,\r\nwhich he transferred to the Czarina, and his valuable territory on the\r\nBlack Sea was quietly confirmed to her by a treaty with the Sultan in\r\n1784. Since then it has formed a part of the Russian Empire, together\r\nwith part of the Kuban and all the land between the Boog, the Dneister,\r\nand the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nThe next scene of Admiral Greig's active service was against the\r\nSwedes, who became implicated in the dispute which ensued between\r\nthe Porte and the Czarina, against whom they rashly declared war.\r\nHostilities ensued; the Swedish troops advanced into Finland, and\r\nrecaptured several towns.\r\n\r\n\"Alexis Count Orloff, appointed to command the Mediterranean fleet,\r\nhas declined that honour, and left the court,\" says the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_ for April, 1788; \"and Admiral Greig, on whom it in course\r\ndevolved, has pleaded the necessity of a journey to his native country,\r\nto be excused from that service.\" The armament offered Greig by the\r\nEmpress was on a magnificent scale; it consisted of twenty-eight ships\r\nof the line, three of them carrying 100 guns and 800 officers and\r\nseamen each; six of 90 guns, with 650 seamen each; four of 80 guns,\r\nwith 600 seamen each; eleven of 74 guns, with 500 men each; two of 64\r\nguns, with 400 men each; two hundred and forty-eight sail of frigates,\r\nsloops, and transports, containing eleven battalions of infantry; two\r\ncarracques, with 1000 horse, and seven of marines; twenty-five victual\r\nand hospital ships, mounting in all 1194 pieces of cannon, and having\r\n28,000 men on board.\r\n\r\nBut the admiral does not seem either to have visited Scotland or sailed\r\nwith this armament to the Mediterranean, as he assumed command of the\r\nImperial Baltic fleet, destined to oppose the Duke of Sudermania,\r\nbrother of the King of Sweden, who put to sea with twenty-one sail,\r\nconsisting of the _Gustavus_, 111, _Sophia_, _Magdalena_, and _Prins\r\nGustaf_, of 70 guns each; nine 60-gun ships, six 40-gun frigates, and\r\nthree smaller vessels.\r\n\r\nCount Wachdmeister led the van, Captain Linderstedt the rear. Sweden\r\nmade incredible exertions in this war, the object of which was to\r\nretake Finland and Carelia; four 40-gun frigates were fitting out at\r\nGottenberg, and nine ships of the line at Carlscrona. The news of these\r\nand other armaments filled St. Petersburg with something very like\r\nconsternation; but Greig prepared for sea with all the vessels he could\r\ncollect, and the utmost activity prevailed at Riga, where Count Brown,\r\na veteran Irish general, was governor. Greig declared, however, to the\r\nEmpress, that if the United Kingdoms of Great Britain engaged in this\r\nwar antagonistic to Russia, he would feel himself under the painful\r\nnecessity of resigning his high rank, and returning to his former\r\nposition of lieutenant in the Royal Navy; \"that he would always exert\r\nhimself to the utmost against any other power who might be in alliance\r\nwith the enemy, but that he would never fire a shot in the face of his\r\nnative country.\" He ordered the calibre of the ship guns to be altered,\r\ndirecting that all from 24-pounders downwards should be of less weight\r\nwith a larger bore.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1788, while war and preparations were pending, a dispute ensued\r\nbetween the Empress and upwards of sixty British officers of her fleet,\r\non occasion of a rumour being spread abroad, that she meant to receive\r\ninto her service Paul Jones, the celebrated Scottish renegade. These\r\ngentlemen, nearly all of whom were Scotsmen, waited on the President\r\nof the Admiralty, and resigned their commissions, delivering, at the\r\nsame time, a manifesto, \"whereby they not only refused to serve under,\r\nbut even _with_ that officer.\" The French officers who were paid by the\r\nCzarina displayed the same repugnance to have this famous privateersman\r\nfor a comrade; and by this dispute, which, however, was soon arranged,\r\nten sail of the line were for a time completely unofficered. To the\r\nsatisfaction of Admiral Greig and his compatriots, it was arranged,\r\nthat \"Mr. Jones should never be appointed to command in that part of\r\nthe ocean where they were employed.\" In the meantime, a scandalous\r\nadventure of the Chevalier Paul with a girl of loose character, ended\r\nhis hope of employment _even_ under Catherine II.\r\n\r\nGreig now received from the Emperor of Germany a present of 10,000\r\nroubles and a valuable estate in Livonia. This was just before\r\nhe sailed from Cronstadt with the fleet, which consisted of one\r\nthree-decker, eight 74-gun ships, eight 66-gun ships, and seven\r\nfrigates, to oppose the formidable force of the Duke of Sudermania,\r\nwhom he overtook between the island of Schten Seaker and the Bay of\r\nCabo de Grund.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Sudermania states, that with thirty-one sail he was\r\ncruising in the Narrows of Kalkboden and Elkhomen in a dense fog, with\r\nan easterly wind, when, early on the morning of the 17th of July, the\r\nreport of alarm guns ahead summoned his crews hurriedly to quarters,\r\nand almost before order of battle could be assumed, amid the dangers\r\nof a lee shore, enveloped in the morning mist, the fleet of the\r\nScoto-Russian Admiral, consisting then of thirty-three sail, all in\r\nclose order, were within gunshot, his van being close to the prince's\r\ncentre. After considerable manoeuvring, in which the skill of Greig is\r\npraised by the prince in his dispatch, they were within musket-shot by\r\nfive P.M., when the battle began in all its fury, and sixty-four ships,\r\ntwenty-nine of which were sail of the line, engaged in all the carnage\r\nof a yard-arm conflict; and so thickly did the smoke of the Russian\r\nfleet settle down upon the Swedes, \"that it was impossible to make or\r\nanswer signals,\" says the Duke of Sudermania, \"or even to distinguish\r\nour own line.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke was in the _Charles Gustavus_, a three-decker; Greig fought\r\nhis own ship, the _Rotislaw_ of 100 guns; and the operations of the day\r\nare thus detailed by him in his dispatch to the Empress:--\r\n\r\n \"I most humbly beg to inform your Imperial Majesty, that on the 17th\r\n of July, about noon, we fell in with the Swedish fleet, consisting of\r\n fifteen ships of the line, carrying from sixty to seventy guns; eight\r\n large frigates (carrying 24-pounders), which were brought into the\r\n line owing to their weight of metal; five smaller frigates, and three\r\n tenders, commanded by the Prince of Sudermania, with an admiral's\r\n flag, and having under his command one vice and two rear admirals. I\r\n immediately signalled to make sail towards the enemy; they formed line\r\n and awaited us--our fleet, as it came up, formed also. The weather was\r\n clear, with a light breeze from the south-east. We bore right down on\r\n the enemy's line, and my flagship, the _Rotislaw_, engaged the Swedish\r\n admiral about five P.M.\r\n\r\n \"The engagement was very hot on both sides, and lasted without\r\n intermission till six. Twice the Swedes attempted to retreat, but as\r\n it fell quite calm during the contest, and the ships would not answer\r\n their helms, the two fleets fell into some confusion, but the fire\r\n was kept up on both sides till dark, and then the Swedes, assisted\r\n by their boats, got to a distance from our ships. In this action\r\n we have taken the _Prince Gustavus_, of 70 guns, which carried the\r\n vice-admiral's flag.\r\n\r\n \"She was defended with great bravery for more than an hour against\r\n the _Rotislaw_, and we had above 200 men killed and wounded on board\r\n before she struck. On board of her was the Count Wachdmeister,\r\n A.D.C. General to the King of Sweden, who commanded the van of the\r\n Swedish fleet. He came on board of my ship with an officer whom I\r\n sent to take possession, and delivered to me his flag and sword. In\r\n consideration of his gallant defence, I restored to him the latter.\r\n\r\n \"I am sorry to inform your Majesty, that in the night, and _after_ the\r\n battle had ceased, the _Wadislaw_ dropped astern of our line and fell\r\n among the Swedish fleet, by whom she was taken, as the darkness of the\r\n night and the thickness of the smoke concealed her from us. I received\r\n notice of this disaster about midnight from a petty officer, who was\r\n dispatched to me before the enemy took possession. In this engagement\r\n several of your Majesty's ships have received considerable damage,\r\n and the whole fleet so much in masts and rigging, that I was not in\r\n a condition to pursue the enemy, who, favoured by the wind, crowded\r\n all the sail they could to reach the coast of Finland, to the east of\r\n Cabo de Grund, and we lost sight of them steering north-east. This\r\n action began between the island of Schten Seaker and the Bay of Cabo\r\n de Grund, the former bearing SSE. distant three German miles, and the\r\n latter NWW. about the same distance, seven and a half miles east of\r\n Hohlang. I subjoin a list of the killed and wounded. The whole fleet\r\n are now repairing sails and rigging.\r\n\r\n \"I must say, on this occasion, that I never saw a battle maintained\r\n with more spirit and courage on both sides; and we have nothing to\r\n boast of but the capture of the commander of the vanguard, and that\r\n the enemy left _us in possession_ of the field of battle. All the\r\n flag officers, and the greater portion of the captains gave proofs\r\n of the utmost courage and firmness; and the bravery of the subaltern\r\n officers in general is entitled to every praise; BUT it is with grief,\r\n that I am obliged to declare myself very much dissatisfied with the\r\n conduct of certain captains, whom I shall be under the necessity of\r\n superseding. This will be done after a more particular inquiry, the\r\n account of which I shall transmit to your Majesty. If they had done\r\n their duty like good officers and faithful subjects, this action would\r\n have been more completely decisive, and have produced consequences\r\n equally satisfactory to your Majesty and your glorious empire. I must\r\n not fail, at the same time, to make a special report of those who, on\r\n this occasion, personally distinguished themselves by their courage\r\n and conduct. (Here follow the lists.)\r\n\r\n \"Sam. Carlovitch Greig.\r\n\r\n \"H.I.M. Ship _Rotislaw_, July 18th, 1788.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke says that his fleet was swept round by the current, and\r\nevery ship was thus raked fore and aft by those of Greig; that after\r\na lull in the conflict, it was renewed at 8 P.M., when, after another\r\ndesperate encounter, the Swedish fleet, with lights at the mast-heads,\r\nbore away for Helsingfors with all sail set, leaving the _Prins\r\nGustaf_, of seventy guns, lying disabled and without a flag; that many\r\nof the Russian ships were severely mauled, but the Swedes were riddled;\r\nfor masts, spars, and even the rudders of some were knocked to pieces,\r\nwhile most of them had received perilous shots between wind and water.\r\n\r\nThe _Wadislaw_, which they took, was a copper-bottomed seventy-four,\r\ncarrying 32 and 42-pounders, with 738 men. It was ten at night before\r\nthe last shot was fired. The Russians remained masters of the channel,\r\nwith all their colours flying; but had the officers all done their\r\nduty, the Swedes would not have escaped so easily, if at all. Greig had\r\n6000 troops on board; their presence in close action greatly increased\r\nhis list of casualties, for he had 319 killed and 666 wounded, whereas\r\nthe Swedes had only eight officers struck, and the number of seamen is\r\nnot known.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Greig was soon after reinforced by four ships of the line; but\r\nas the Duke of Sudermania received six more of seventy guns each, the\r\nfleets remained of nearly equal strength.\r\n\r\nCount Wachdmiester had yielded his sword to Greig, who returned it to\r\nhim, saying, \"I will never be the man to deprive so brave and worthy an\r\nofficer of his sword--I beseech you to receive it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter making a suitable reply, the count sheathed it, and said, \"that\r\nneither he nor any other person in Sweden believed that the Russian\r\nfleet was in so admirable a condition as he found it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Russian seamen had fought with incredible ardour and bravery;\r\nwhen the wadding ran short, many of them tore off their clothing\r\nto clean and charge home the cannon; but _all_ the officers were\r\nby no means partners in their glory; for Greig found himself under\r\nthe painful necessity of placing under arrest two captains, two\r\ncaptain-lieutenants, and thirteen other officers, all Russians, and\r\nsending them to St. Petersburg in the frigate _La Kergopolte_, of\r\ntwenty-four guns, charged with having \"abandoned Rear-Admiral Bergen\r\nwhen he was surrounded by four Swedish ships, and defending himself\r\nagainst them for two hours with the greatest bravery, till he was\r\ncompelled to strike, when his ship, the _Wadislaw_, was completely\r\nshattered.\"\r\n\r\nSir Samuel Greig added, that he had repeatedly signalled to those\r\nofficers \"to advance and support the commander of their division, but\r\nthat either from not understanding the said signals, or from some other\r\nreason, they remained where they were, and saw him taken.\" Concerning\r\ntheir misconduct, and the battle of the 17th July, the Empress\r\nimmediately wrote, with her own hand, the following characteristic\r\nletter to her gallant Admiral:--\r\n\r\n \"TO THE MOST WORTHY AND BRAVE, &C.\r\n\r\n \"We should be wanting in that gratitude and politeness which should\r\n ever distinguish sovereigns, did we not with the utmost speed convey\r\n to you our approbation of your exemplary conduct; and the obligations\r\n which we owe you for your intrepid conduct in your engagement with\r\n the fleet of our enemy, the Swedish king. To the constant exertion of\r\n _your abilities_, and _your zeal_ for the glory of the common cause of\r\n ourselves and the whole Russian Empire, may, under God, be attributed\r\n the very signal victory you have gained; and we have not the smallest\r\n doubt, but that every part of our dominions, to which this event shall\r\n be transmitted, will behold it in its proper view. It is with grief we\r\n read the record of these poltroons, who, unable to catch fire from\r\n the spirited exertions of their brother-warriors, have so signalized\r\n themselves in the annals of treasonable cowardice! and to that\r\n cowardice the Swede has to boast that any ship of their fleet escaped\r\n when so encountered.\r\n\r\n \"It is our pleasure that the delinquents mentioned in your despatch be\r\n immediately brought to Cronstadt, to await our further displeasure. We\r\n sincerely wish _you_, and all with you, health, and the most signal\r\n assistance of the Almighty God, whose aid we have invoked, and of\r\n whose assistance we cannot doubt in a cause so just.\r\n\r\n \"Your services will live perpetually in our remembrance; and the\r\n annals of our Empire must convey your name to posterity with reverence\r\n and with love!\r\n\r\n \"So saying, we recommend you to God's keeping ever. Done at St.\r\n Petersburg, the 23rd of July, in the year of grace 1788.\r\n\r\n \"Catherine.\"\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the seventeen unfortunates was peculiarly Russian in\r\nits barbarity; for they were placed in chains, with iron collars around\r\ntheir necks, and doomed to perpetual slavery in the hulks at Cronstadt,\r\nthough many were cadets of the noblest Muscovite families.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, Professor Schloeger, of Gottingen, published in his political\r\nmagazine the orders issued by the Czarina to the admiral before leaving\r\nCronstadt; and by these it appears, that he \"was to attack, and, if\r\npossible, to carry away the Swedish admiral-general, even at the total\r\nloss of the whole fleet of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly a fortnight Greig busied himself in thoroughly refitting\r\nhis fleet; on the 6th of August he signalled to weigh anchor at dawn,\r\nand on the 7th arrived off Sveaborg, where he found four Swedish ships\r\nat anchor in the roads; but they cut their cables, and, under a press\r\nof sail, retired into port in confusion. Greig followed them boldly,\r\nand just as his leading ship came within musket-shot of the sternmost\r\nSwede, the latter struck upon a sunken rock; her mainmast went by\r\nthe board, and after maintaining a short cannonade with Admiral\r\nRoslainow, she struck her colours. The other three escaped into shallow\r\nwater. Greig's boats took possession of the bilged ship, which proved\r\nto be the _Gustavus Adolphus_, of 64 guns, commanded by _Colonel_\r\nChristierne, who was taken prisoner with thirteen officers and 530 men,\r\nafter which Greig ordered her to be blown up. He next seized a ship\r\nladen with cables, sails, medicine, &c., for the Swedish fleet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Duke of Sudermania remained a quiet spectator in\r\nSveaborg, where he was completely blocked up by Greig, although he had\r\nunder his command sixteen ships of the line and eight frigates.\r\n\r\nTill the 9th Greig remained off Sveaborg, which is strongly fortified\r\nby nature and art, and then, in the hope that the duke would come out,\r\nas the wind was favourable for his doing so, he sailed slowly across\r\nthe Gulf of Finland towards the opposite coast of Revel, and on his\r\napproaching the isle of Margen, placed his cruisers towards the west,\r\nso as completely to cut off the Swedish fleet from all succour by way\r\nof Carlscrona, and to prevent them forming a junction with five ships\r\nladen with stores, of which they were in the greatest need.\r\n\r\nHere Greig was joined by two 64-gun ships; and on the 14th of August he\r\nwas off Revel in Esthonia. Meanwhile the Swedish and Russian troops had\r\nmany fierce encounters in Finland; but the former were unsuccessful,\r\nand this expedition ended in defeat and disaster.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable Greig continued to cruise in the gulf until the month\r\nof October; and, though suffering from a severe illness, he completely\r\nblocked up the Swedes in Sveaborg, cut them off from succour, and saved\r\nSt. Petersburg from alarm.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd October, the weather became exceedingly stormy, and the\r\nRussian fleet were all dispersed. Then the Duke of Sudermania thought\r\nhe might essay something against Greig; but, though sick and infirm,\r\nthe latter soon collected all his ships, and the blockade was resumed\r\nmore strictly than ever; but, unhappily, his illness terminated in\r\na violent fever, and, on the 26th of that month the brave admiral\r\nexpired, in the fifty-third year of his age, on board of his flagship\r\nthe _Rotislaw_, to the great sorrow of every officer and seaman in\r\nthe fleet, where, by his bravery, justice, generosity, and goodness\r\nof heart, he had indeed won for himself the honourable title of the\r\n_Father of the Russian Navy_.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of his death were the signal for a general mourning at\r\nSt. Petersburg; and, while Admiral Spiritoff assumed the command of\r\nthe fleet, the Empress ordered the interment of her favourite officer\r\nto be conducted with a pomp, solemnity, and magnificence never before\r\nwitnessed in Russia.\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place on the 5th of December. Some days before it,\r\nthe body lay on a state bed in the hall of the Admiralty, which was\r\nhung with black cloth, while the doors were festooned with white crape,\r\nand the vast apartment was lighted by silver lustres. Under a canopy\r\nof crape the body was placed on three small arches, dressed in full\r\nuniform, the head being encircled by a wreath of laurel. At its foot\r\nstood an urn, adorned with silver anchors and streamers, inscribed--\r\n\r\n \"S.G. nat. d. 30 Nov. 1735--obit d. 15 Oct. 1788.\"\r\n\r\nThe coffin stood on six feet of massy silver. It was covered with\r\nblack velvet, lined with white satin; the handles and fringes were\r\nof pure silver, and the pillows of blonde lace. On three tabourettes\r\nof crimson and gold lay his five orders of knighthood--one of them,\r\nthe St. George's Cross, mutilated by a shot in the Archipelago; and\r\naround were twelve pedestals, covered with crape and flowers, bearing\r\ntwelve gigantic candles. At the head of the bed hung all his flags;\r\nand two staff officers and six marine captains were constantly beside\r\nit until the day of interment, when Lieutenant the Baron Vanden Pahlen\r\npronounced a high eulogy in honour of the brave deceased.\r\n\r\nThe cannon of the ramparts and fleet fired minute-guns during the\r\nprocession from the Admiralty to the Cathedral of St. Catherine,\r\nthrough streets lined by the troops. The funeral pageant was very\r\nmagnificent and impressive.\r\n\r\nSwartzenhoup's dragoons, with standards lowered; the grenadiers of the\r\nEmpress, with arms reversed; the public schools of the capital; the\r\nclergy of the Greek Church; General Lehman, of the marine artillery,\r\nand two marshals bearing Greig's admiral's staff and five orders of\r\nknighthood; eighteen staff officers, and three bearing naval standards,\r\npreceded the body, which was borne on a bier drawn by six horses, led\r\nby six bombardiers, and attended by twelve captains of ships, followed\r\nby their coxswains. Then came General Wrangel, governor of the city,\r\nwith the nobles, citizens, the marshals with their staves, and a\r\nregiment of infantry with arms reversed, and its band playing one of\r\nthose grand dead-marches which are peculiar to Russia. So, with a band\r\nof choristers preceding it, and amid the tolling of bells, the remains\r\nof Admiral Greig were conveyed to the great cathedral, and there\r\nlowered into their last resting-place, amid three discharges of cannon\r\nand musketry from the ramparts, the troops, and the fleet, where he was\r\nso well beloved and so much lamented.\r\n\r\nEvery officer who attended had a gold ring presented to him by\r\nCatherine II., with the admiral's name and the day of his death\r\nengraved upon it; and a magnificent monument has since been erected to\r\nmark the place where he lies--a man \"no less illustrious for courage\r\nand naval skill, than for piety, benevolence, and every private virtue.\"\r\n\r\nHis estate in Livonia is still in possession of his descendants.\r\n\r\nHis son John died in China in 1793. Another son became Sir Alexis\r\nGreig, Admiral of the Russian fleet, and Knight of all the Imperial\r\norders. In 1783 he studied at the High School of Edinburgh; he served\r\nas a volunteer on board the _Culloden_ under Admiral Trowbridge,\r\nand commanded the Russian fleets at the sieges of Varna and Anapa in\r\n1828; though in 1801 he had been exiled to Siberia for remonstrating\r\nwith the Emperor Paul for his severity to certain British sailors.\r\nHis son Woronzow Greig (also educated, I believe, at the High School\r\nof Edinburgh) was A.D.C. to Prince Menschicoff, and bore a flag of\r\ntruce from Sebastopol to Lord Raglan. He died of a mortal wound on the\r\ndesperate field of Inkermann.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: His father was a seafaring man. In the _Edinburgh\r\nCourant_, 24th June, 1761, was the following notice: \"The _Thistle_,\r\nCapt. Charles Greig, of Inverkeithing, bound for St. Petersburg, passed\r\nthe Sound on the 6th instant.\" In Russia, the admiral bore the name of\r\nSamuel _Carlovitch_ Greig (_i.e._ the son of Charles).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Tooke states that Mrs. Greig was not at Leghorn; but the\r\nFrench authorities affirm that she was, and place this event in 1774.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: In the battle with the Swedes in 1790, four Russian ships\r\nwere commanded by Scottish captains, viz., Denniston, whose head was\r\nshot off; Marshal, who was drowned when leading his boarders; Miller\r\nand Aikin, who each lost a leg. The latter died under the torture of\r\nhis wound. Six Russian admirals, all Scotchmen, Mackenzie, Ogilvie,\r\nMercer, Mason, and the two Greigs, have hoisted their flags in the\r\nBlack Sea. Mackenzie was the first naval chief at Sebastopol.--See\r\nSlade's _Travels_, vol. ii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD-MARSHAL COUNT BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlysses Maximilian Brown, Field-Marshal of the armies of the Empress\r\nMaria Theresa, Governor of Prague, and Knight of the Golden Fleece, was\r\nborn on the 24th of October, 1705.\r\n\r\nHis father, Ulysses Baron de Brown and Camus, the representative\r\nand descendant of one of the most ancient families in Ireland, was\r\nthen a Colonel of Cuirassiers in the service of Joseph I., Emperor\r\nof Austria, and was one of the many brave Irish gentlemen who, after\r\nthe unfortunate battle of Aughrim, the surrender of Galway, and\r\ncapitulation of King James's army under St. Ruth, at Limerick, were\r\nforced to feed themselves by the blades of their swords in the service\r\nof foreign countries. When Marshal Catinat and the Duke of Savoy laid\r\nsiege to Valenza in 1696, they had no less than six battalions of Irish\r\nexiles in their army. Baron Brown had served under the Emperor Leopold\r\nI., who died in 1703; and by the Emperor Charles VI. had been created\r\nCount of the Holy Roman Empire; while his brother George received the\r\nsame exalted rank, being at the same time a distinguished general of\r\ninfantry, colonel of a regiment of musketeers, and councillor of war.\r\n\r\nIn his childhood Ulysses Maximilian was sent to the city of Limerick\r\nby his father, and there, for a few years, he pursued his studies at\r\na public school, until his uncle, Count George Brown, sent for him,\r\nwhen only _ten_ years of age, to join his regiment of infantry, which\r\nwas then with the army marching into Hungary, under the famous and\r\ngallant Prince Eugene of Savoy, against the Turks, who had invaded the\r\nImperial frontier. With this army the great Count Saxe was serving as\r\na subaltern officer.\r\n\r\nThe Turks had broken the peace of Carlovitz in 1715, conquered the\r\nMorea, declared war against Venice, besieged Corfu, and spread a\r\ngeneral alarm among the courts of Europe. The Emperor's mediation was\r\nrejected with disdain by Achmet III., the imperious Porte, whose army,\r\n150,000 strong, hovered on the right bank of the Danube; but Prince\r\nEugene, with a small, well disciplined force, having passed the river\r\nin sight of the inactive Osmanli, encamped at Peterwaradin, on the\r\nconfines of Sclavonia. Ulysses Maximilian Brown was with this army in\r\nthe regiment of his uncle.\r\n\r\nA battle ensued on the 5th August, 1716, near Carlovitz, and the Turks\r\nwere totally routed, with the loss of their Grand Vizier Ali, and\r\n30,000 slain; while fifty standards, 250 pieces of cannon, and all\r\ntheir baggage, were taken. Other, but minor victories followed, and in\r\nthe month of June the brave Prince Eugene invested Belgrade, the key\r\nof the Ottoman dominions on the Hungarian frontier. For two months it\r\nwas vigorously defended by 30,000 men, while the Turkish army, under\r\nthe new Grand Vizier, was intrenched close by, in a semi-circle which\r\nstretched from the Danube to the Save, thus inclosing the troops of\r\nEugene in the marshes between those rapid rivers.\r\n\r\nBy war and disease the Imperialists suffered fearfully; fighting of\r\nthe most desperate kind ensued daily; and there, while yet a child,\r\nthe little Irish boy was taught to handle his espontoon, and became a\r\nwitness of, if not an actor in, those military barbarities which have\r\nalways blackened a war along the Ottoman frontier.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent to Eugene that the Turks, by destroying the bridge of\r\nthe Save, might obstruct his retreat, surprise a body of his Austrians\r\nat Semlin, or cut off his artillery, which were bombarding the lower\r\ntown of Belgrade, while sickness and scarcity pressed severely upon\r\nhis slender force; thus it became evident that nothing but a decisive\r\nvictory would save him from gradual destruction. Already the Turks,\r\n200,000 strong, were within musket-shot, and would soon storm his\r\nlines, which were defended by only 40,000 men, exclusive of the 20,000\r\nwho were blocking up Belgrade.\r\n\r\nOn a dark midnight--the 16th of August--after uniting his forces\r\nby firing three bombs, he attacked the mighty host of the Sultan\r\nAchmet--the most complete that Turkey had ever equipped for battle.\r\nFavoured by a thick fog, the Austrians broke through the slow and heavy\r\nOsmanli, stormed all their intrenchments at the point of the bayonet,\r\nturned their _own_ guns upon them, and grape-shotted the turbaned\r\nfugitives, whose unwieldy army was totally routed, and fled, leaving\r\nevery cannon and baggage-waggon behind. The surrender of Belgrade,\r\ntwo days after, was the immediate consequence of this brilliant\r\nvictory, and the Peace of Passarovitz, which, under the mediation of\r\nGreat Britain, was signed in July, 1718, succeeded in establishing a\r\ntwenty-five years' truce, and securing to Austria the western part of\r\nWallachia, Servia, Belgrade, and part of Bosnia.\r\n\r\nAfter this battle, Ulysses Brown, then in his twelfth year, was sent to\r\nRome, where he continued his studies at the Clementine College, for the\r\nperiod of four years.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 he went to Prague, and in two years completed himself in the\r\nstudy of civil law.\r\n\r\nHe then entered the Austrian army, and in 1723 became a captain in\r\nthe regiment of infantry commanded by his uncle, Count George Brown;\r\nand such was his ardour and such his knowledge in the art of war,\r\nthat only two years after, in 1725, we find him appointed to the\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy of the same corps.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August in the following year he married Maria\r\nPhilippina, Countess of Martinitz, the beautiful Bohemian heiress, and\r\nthe last of an ancient and noble line.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 he served in the expedition to Corsica, and by his bravery\r\nand example contributed greatly to secure the capture of Callansara,\r\nwhere he was severely wounded in the thigh. This successful expedition\r\ncaused a rumour that the island was to be erected into a kingdom for\r\nthe Chevalier de St. George--James VIII. of the Scottish Jacobites;\r\nand George II., on being bribed by the Genoese, prohibited his English\r\nsubjects from furnishing any assistance to the troops or inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn 1732, Count Brown was made Chamberlain of the Austrian Empire: and\r\nin 1734 was appointed full colonel of infantry, and Italy was the next\r\nscene of his service.\r\n\r\nFrance had resolved on humbling the overweening power of the House of\r\nHapsburg; the venerable Marshal Villars crossed the Alps, and with\r\na combined army of French and Spaniards, burst into Milan, overran\r\nAustrian Lombardy, and carrying victory wherever he marched, in two\r\nmonths' time left only Mantua under the flag of Charles VI. The latter\r\nmade strenuous efforts to protect himself--to secure the passage of\r\nthe Rhine against the Marshal Duke of Berwick on one hand, and to\r\nrecover his power in Italy from Villars on the other. The Diet voted\r\nhim 120,000 men; the Count de Merci marched 6000 of these to protect\r\nthe important fortress of Mantua; and with a force increased to 60,000\r\nsoldiers, drew towards the head of the Oglio and Po.\r\n\r\nLeaving his young wife at the court of Vienna, Count Brown accompanied\r\nthis force with his regiment of German infantry; and it was among the\r\nfirst of those brave battalions which effected the arduous passage\r\nof the Po near Santo Benedetto, where the Count de Merci so boldly\r\nand skilfully surprised the French troops, and drove them back at\r\nthe bayonet's point, with the loss of all their ammunition, baggage,\r\nand the cities of Guastalla, Novella, and Mirandola, of which he\r\nimmediately took possession.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign Count Brown distinguished himself on every\r\noccasion, but most particularly at the great battle of Parma, on the\r\n29th of June, 1734. There a desperate hand-to-hand conflict ensued in\r\nfront of the city, on the high road which leads to Piacenza; and after\r\na struggle as deadly as Italy ever saw, the Austrians remained masters\r\nof the field; but the Count de Merci, their general, was mortally\r\nwounded by a musket-ball, and Count Brown and the Prince of Wirtemberg,\r\nthe lieutenant-general, had their horses shot under them. The French\r\nmade their most desperate stand at a farm-house, from the walls of\r\nwhich \"they mowed down whole companies of the Imperialists by grape\r\nand musket-shot. This dreadful conflict lasted for ten hours without\r\nintermission, when the enemy retired in good order towards the walls\r\nof Parma.\" On the field lay ten thousand corpses; of the Imperialists\r\nthere fell the commander-in-chief, seven generals, and three hundred\r\nand forty officers, were killed and wounded. Thus ended an attack which\r\nthe Count de Merci risked in direct opposition to the _advice_ of Count\r\nBrown and other officers of experience. The Imperial army now fell back\r\nupon Guastalla, where it was the good fortune of Count Brown to save it\r\nand the cause of Charles VI. from total destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, under the Prince of Wirtemberg, were posted between the\r\nCrostolo and the Po, near some strong redoubts at the head of one of\r\ntheir bridges; and there, on the 19th of September, they were attacked\r\nby the French, when after a hard conflict of eight hours, during which\r\nBrown, then in his twenty-ninth year, charged repeatedly at the head\r\nof his regiment, the Austrians were driven back, with the loss of\r\nfour standards, while the gallant Prince of Wirtemberg, old General\r\nColmenaro, the Prince of Saxe Gotha, and many other brave men, were\r\nslain.\r\n\r\nCount Brown made incredible exertions to preserve discipline, and with\r\nhis own regiment to cover the rear of the discomfited Imperialists,\r\nwho were thus enabled to fall back in good order to a new and stronger\r\nposition on the northward of the Po, where they kept the field until\r\nJanuary in the ensuing year, when the wearied French and Spaniards\r\nretired into winter quarters. One of the most brilliant feats of the\r\ncampaign was the destruction of the bridge which the Marshal Duke de\r\nNoailles had thrown over the Adige. At the head of his regiment the\r\nbrave Irish soldier of fortune achieved this arduous task in sight of\r\nthe whole French army, under a heavy discharge of cannon and musketry.\r\nThus terminated the Lombardo campaign, in which Austria, if she did not\r\nlose her honour, won but little glory, though in the two battles of\r\nParma and Guastalla she lost ten thousand soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe French strengthened their forces, and a cruel edict was issued\r\nat Paris, ordaining all British subjects in France between the ages\r\nof fifteen and fifty to enlist in the Irish Brigade, or go to the\r\ngalleys--an edict which was enforced with such rigour, that in fifteen\r\ndays all the Parisian prisons were crowded with British residents,\r\nchiefly poor Scottish Jacobites; but France soon found other and more\r\nworthy means of reinforcing her armies in Italy and on the Rhine, than\r\nby resorting to such inhospitable tyranny.\r\n\r\nFor his services in the Italian war, Count Brown received a general's\r\ncommission in 1736 from the Emperor Charles VI., who, discouraged\r\nby his reverses, signified a desire for peace; but it was scarcely\r\nnegotiated, before he became involved in a new war that broke out on\r\nthe confines of Europe and Asia. The rapid progress of the Russians\r\nagainst the Turks, and their capture of the Crimea, excited the\r\nambition of Charles, who, by the treaty of 1726, was bound to assist\r\nRussia against the Porte; and now that prophecy, so often propagated,\r\nwas in every one's mouth, that the period fatal to the Crescent was\r\narrived!\r\n\r\nAgain the Osmanli turned their arms against Hungary; and to protect\r\nthat ancient kingdom rather than to assist the Czarina (who demanded\r\nof Austria 10,000 horse and 20,000 foot), Charles sent 8000 Saxon\r\ninfantry, under Field-Marshal Seckendorf and General Count Brown, with\r\nwhom the Duke of Lorraine went as a volunteer. By the peculation of\r\nthe commissaries and contractors, these forces suffered incredible\r\nhardships, and their leaders found Gradisca, Bioc, even Belgrade,\r\nand all the Hungarian frontier fortresses dilapidated, and incapable\r\nof being defended. More troops and 600,000 florins were promised to\r\nthem from Vienna, but neither came. Thus Seckendorf and Brown found\r\nthemselves before the Turks with a small army of recruits, destitute\r\nof horses, caissons, and all the munitions of war. On receiving\r\n10,000 florins, they raised 26,000 infantry, 15,000 horse, and 4000\r\nirregulars; but the indecision of the Emperor, who interfered with all\r\ntheir arrangements, the nature of their forces, clamours among their\r\nsoldiers, cabals among their officers, the severities they encountered,\r\nand the pressing ardour of the Osmanli, gave to the Imperial arms but\r\na succession of humiliating defeats; and though Brown's fiery energy\r\ncaptured many small fortresses, others of greater importance were lost\r\nby Seckendorf, and at last Belgrade, the scene of our hero's earlier\r\nservice, was besieged.\r\n\r\nBanjaluca, a strongly fortified town, which has two castles to defend\r\nit, and which stands on the frontier of Bosnia, at the confluence of\r\nthe Verbas with the Save, was skilfully invested by the Austrians under\r\nthe Prince of Hildburghausen, but he was compelled to raise the siege,\r\nand after a bloody conflict, was driven towards the Save by the Turks.\r\n\r\nCharles, alarmed for the safety of Austria, ordered Seckendorf and\r\nBrown to march through Servia, and form a junction with the prince,\r\nwhich they immediately did, after dispatching a reinforcement to\r\nMarshal Kevenhüller. With only 20,000 men they fought a way through\r\nServia, and made themselves masters of Utzitza, after a short siege,\r\nand would have taken Zwornick, but for an inundation of the Drina.\r\nOn the 16th of October they encamped on the southern bank of the\r\nSave. Thus, they arrived in time to share some of the fighting near\r\nBanjaluca, and on the retreat from thence the Austrian baggage, sick,\r\nand wounded, were only saved from the barbarous Mussulmans by the\r\npersonal exertions of Count Brown, who secured that movement by his\r\nvalour and example.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged by the misfortunes of his army, Charles VI. resolved\r\nto end a strife in which his troops gathered nothing but disgrace;\r\nand, leaving the quarrel to the mediation of France, he bequeathed\r\nto the Czarina the whole brunt of the war. The ill-success of the\r\nAustrians was attributed to the unfortunate Seckendorf, the victim of\r\ncircumstances and the cabals of the Jesuits; thus he was committed,\r\nfor an unlimited time, to the gloomy Castle of Glatz, an old fortress\r\non the mountains of Silesia. On the peace of Belgrade being signed,\r\nMarshal Wallace was also sent prisoner to Zigieth, and Count Neuperg\r\nwas placed in the Castle of Holitz; and as these three generals were\r\nordered to remain captive during the lifetime of the Emperor, no part\r\nof the stigma of their ill-success fell on their Irish compatriot,\r\nBrown, who, on his return to Vienna, in 1735, was created Field\r\nMarshal-lieutenant, and a member of the Aulic Council of War.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, his friend and master, Charles VI. (having\r\nunfortunately surfeited himself with mushrooms), died. He was the\r\n_last_ prince of the ancient House of Hapsburg, sixteenth Emperor of\r\nGermany, and eleventh King of Bohemia; and the grave had scarcely\r\nclosed over him, ere the disputed succession to his hereditary\r\ndominions kindled another war in Europe.\r\n\r\nBy the Pragmatic Sanction his ancient possessions were guaranteed to\r\nhis daughter, the Archduchess Maria Theresa (Queen of Hungary and\r\nBohemia, and wife of Francis Stephen, Duke of Tuscany), by Britain,\r\nRussia, Holland, France, Spain, and Prussia; but the three last-named\r\npowers fell--as an old writer says--\"upon the poor distressed orphan\r\nqueen, like three wolves, without mercy or equity;\" and in defiance\r\nof their solemn league, the Bavarian Elector laid claim to Bohemia;\r\nthe sovereigns of France, Poland, and Saxony demanded all the vast\r\ninheritance of Austria each for themselves; and all prepared for open\r\nwar, while Maria Theresa quietly took possession of her father's throne.\r\n\r\nAt this startling crisis Count Brown was in command at Breslau. The\r\nfirst blow of this new and general contest was struck by Frederick\r\nIII. of Prussia, who, having at his disposal all the immense treasure\r\nwhich had been accumulated by the rigid economy of his politic father,\r\ntogether with 76,000 idle troops, for whom he had been left to find\r\nemployment, now revived an ancient claim to Silesia, based upon such\r\npretensions as the English kings of old advanced to the thrones of\r\nScotland and France; and suddenly marching twenty battalions of\r\ninfantry and thirty-six squadrons of horse into the duchy, he took\r\npossession of Breslau, its capital, from which Count Brown was forced\r\nto retire, having only 3000 men, with whom he retreated towards\r\nMoravia, leaving small garrisons in Glogau and Breig, which Frederick\r\nblockaded with six battalions. This was in the January of 1741.\r\n\r\nFrederick now offered to supply the Queen of Hungary (as Maria Theresa\r\nwas styled) with money and troops to support her claims against _the\r\nother_ violators of the Pragmatic Sanction, provided she would cede\r\nto him the Silesian province. Aware of the danger of yielding to one\r\npretender, she sent Count Neuperg (who, since the Peace of Belgrade,\r\nhad been a captive) with an army to the assistance of the faithful\r\nBrown, who, after disputing every inch of Frederick's progress, had\r\nmaintained the contest with him single-handed for two months.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia sent a detachment of infantry across the Oder to\r\nattack Brown's garrison of 300 men in Namslau, where they surrendered\r\nin a fortnight. Leaving one regiment in Breslau, he marched against\r\nBrown's next garrison, consisting of 400 men, in Ohlau, under\r\nColonel Formentini, who finding the place ruinous, and the Prussians\r\noverwhelming, capitulated. Then General Kleist invested Breig with five\r\nbattalions and four squadrons.\r\n\r\nCount Neuperg, one of Austria's best generals, being a senior officer,\r\nassumed the command of the whole force, which he had first assembled\r\nin the environs of Olmutz, and sent General Lentulus to occupy the\r\nnarrow defiles of Glatz in Silesia, and thus protect Bohemia. Neuperg,\r\nmeanwhile, meditated operations on the Neiss, and his hussars cut off\r\nthe King of Prussia's convoys and outposts in every direction. The\r\nskirmishes around Neiss were incessant, and in one cavalry encounter\r\nFrederick was nearly taken prisoner--a stroke which would have ended\r\nthe war at once. After many manoeuvres and encounters, the armies of\r\nNeuperg and Frederick drew near each other, on the 10th of April, 1741,\r\nat Molowitz, a village in the neighbourhood of Neiss, where a desperate\r\nbattle was fought.\r\n\r\nOn this inauspicious day--inauspicious for the Austrian cause--General\r\nCount Brown (or _Braün_, as the King of Prussia names him in his\r\nworks) commanded the infantry. The scene of the encounter was within\r\na league of the river Neiss, and the ground was mantled with snow to\r\nthe depth of two feet. The Prussian army consisted of twenty-seven\r\nbattalions of infantry, twenty-nine squadrons of cavalry, and three of\r\nhussars.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian infantry were, at that time, says Frederick, who had\r\nbrought their discipline to perfection, \"walking batteries! The\r\nrapidity of loading tripled their fire, and made a Prussian equal\r\nto three adversaries.\" They came on with such ardour, that Marshal\r\nNeuperg had to form his troops in order of battle under a cannonade\r\nfrom Frederick's artillery; but the right wing of his cavalry (thirty\r\nsquadrons), under Roemer, fell headlong on the Prussian left, and drove\r\nback their blue-coated dragoons. On they continued to press, with\r\nswords uplifted, until the steady fire of two grenadier battalions\r\nrouted them, and slew the brave Roemer as he led them to the charge for\r\nthe third time.\r\n\r\nAt this critical moment, the infantry under Brown rushed on, and,\r\nthough unsupported by cavalry, made incredible efforts to break through\r\nFrederick's serried ranks; and in this struggle the first battalion of\r\nhis guards lost half its officers, and no less than 800 men. For five\r\nhours the firing continued; and, as ammunition failed, the dead were\r\nall turned on their faces, and their pouches emptied, to carry on the\r\nstrife, which was only ended by Marshal Schwerin making a motion with\r\nhis left, which threatened the Austrian flank. \"This,\" says Frederick,\r\nin the _History of his Own Times_, \"was the signal of victory, and the\r\nAustrian defeat--their rout was total.\" This was at six, P.M.\r\n\r\nCount Brown was severely wounded, and Maria Theresa had 180 officers,\r\n7000 horse and foot, killed, and three standards, seven cannon, and\r\n1200 prisoners taken, with 3000 wounded. Brown, though faint with loss\r\nof blood, never left his saddle; but, by his efforts at the head of the\r\ninfantry, covered the retreat of the whole army, which Neuperg, who\r\nwas also wounded, ordered to retire under the cannon of Neiss, leaving\r\nFrederick victorious on the field, where he remained for three weeks.\r\n\r\nAvailing himself of this success, the victor, after a short siege, took\r\nBreig, removed his head-quarters to Strehlen, and, on driving 4000\r\nAustrian hussars from the important pass of Fryewalde, began to recruit\r\nhis army among the conquered Silesians. Re-establishing himself in\r\nBreslau, on being joined by the Duke of Holstein, his army, consisting\r\nof forty-three battalions and seventy squadrons, would soon have cut\r\noff all communication between the troops of Neuperg and his supplies;\r\nand moreover, would have formed a junction with the armies of France\r\nand Bavaria, which had now taken the field in his favour--the former\r\nunder the famous marshal, Duke de Belleisle, and the latter under their\r\nElector. The outposts of their allied enemies were now within eight\r\nGerman miles of Vienna, and the cause of the young and beautiful Maria\r\nTheresa seemed almost desperate. She retired to Presburg, where her\r\nappearance before the assembled Palatines, with an infant son in her\r\narms, kindled such an enthusiasm that, as one man, they drew their\r\nsabres, exclaiming \"We will die for our sovereign, Maria Theresa!\"\r\n\r\nShe sent for Count Brown in 1743, to be present at her coronation, and,\r\nas a reward for his past services, made him a privy councillor of the\r\nkingdom of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe brave Hungarian nobles now rose in arms, and old Count Palfy\r\nmarched at the head of 30,000 men to relieve Vienna, the Governor of\r\nwhich, Marshal Kevenhüller, had only 12,000 men to resist the three\r\narmies of France, Prussia, and Bavaria, while the Marshals Neuperg and\r\nBrown covered the roads to Bohemia with 20,000 men, as a protection\r\nagainst the kingdom of Bavaria. In all the operations of the Austrians,\r\nduring the many encounters and severe campaigns of 1742-3, Count Brown\r\ncommanded the vanguard or first division, and always with honour.\r\n\r\nPrince Charles of Lorraine having succeeded Marshal Neuperg in command\r\nof the army, encountered the enemy near Braunau, and a desperate, but\r\ndrawn battle (in which his forces suffered most) was fought, while\r\nPrince Lobcowitz, on marching from Bohemia, drove the French from all\r\ntheir posts and garrisons in the Upper Palatinate. Then the combined\r\nforces of the Prince, Brown, and Lobcowitz, forced those of Marshal\r\nBroglio to abandon their strongly intrenched camp at Pladling, on the\r\nDanube, and to fall back in confusion on the Rhine, while the irregular\r\nhorse, Croats, Pandours, and Foot Talpaches, harassed their rear-guard,\r\nand exterminated the stragglers.\r\n\r\nIn this expedition Count Brown seized Deckendorf at the head of the\r\nvanguard, captured a vast quantity of baggage, and obliged the French,\r\nafter immense slaughter, to abandon the banks of the Danube, which the\r\nwhole Austrian army, under the Prince of Lorraine, passed in security\r\non the 6th of June.\r\n\r\nOn this spot a pillar was afterwards erected, bearing, in the following\r\ninscription, an honourable testimony to the valour of the Irish hero:--\r\n\r\n \"Theresiæ Austriacæ Augustæ Duce Exercitus,\r\n       Carlo Alexandro Lothairingico,\r\n   Septemdecim, superatis hostilibus villis,\r\n Captoque Deckendorfio, renitendibus undis,\r\n           Resistentibus, Gallis,\r\n   Duce exercitus Ludovico Borbonio Contio\r\n           Transivit hic Danubium,\r\n Ulysses Maximilianus Brown, Campi Marashalus,\r\n           Die 5o Junii,\" A.D. 1743.\r\n\r\nWhen Marshal Broglio reached Donawert, in the Swabian circle, he\r\nwas joined by 12,000 men, under the warlike Maurice Count de Saxe,\r\nafterwards Marshal General of France and Duke of Courland; but finding\r\nhis main body almost destroyed, instead of hazarding a battle, he\r\nretreated before Prince Charles and Brown to Heilbron, and there\r\nabandoning to them his artillery and baggage, retired with greater\r\nprecipitation to Prague.\r\n\r\nLorraine followed, and encamped in sight of them, along the hills of\r\nGirisnitz. The French marshals offered to surrender Prague, Egra, and\r\nall their captures in Bohemia, provided they were permitted to march\r\nhome with the honours of war. These offers were rejected with disdain;\r\nPrague was invested on all sides, and though the Marshal de Maillebois\r\nmarched to its relief, he achieved nothing, for the Austrians possessed\r\nall the passes of the mountains, and he was compelled to retreat as a\r\nfugitive, harassed and galled by the troops of Prince Charles, who left\r\nPrince Lobcowitz to watch the motions of the Dukes of Belleisle and\r\nBroglio in the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these marshals fled from his command in the disguise\r\nof a courier; the former abandoned the city in a dark and cold\r\nDecember night, and, with 14,000 men and 30 guns, made his way towards\r\nAlsace, enduring unheard-of miseries; 900 men whom he left behind\r\nhim surrendered at discretion; and thus again the ancient capital of\r\nBohemia reverted to the House of Austria, which, however, lost the\r\nDuchy of Silesia by the treaty of Breslau, which ceded it for ever to\r\nthe kingdom of Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1743 Count Brown was sent by his Imperial Mistress to Worms\r\nas her plenipotentiary to George II. of Great Britain, with whose\r\nministers he spared no pains to arrange the important alliance between\r\nthe Courts of London, Vienna, and Turin. On this service he acquitted\r\nhimself with an ability no way inferior to the courage he had displayed\r\nin so many fields.\r\n\r\nThe arena of his next service was again in Italy, where the Austrian\r\nforces were still fighting against the Spaniards, and pursuing the old\r\nwar between the houses of Bourbon and Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Count Gages, who commanded the Spaniards in Bologna, having\r\nreceived instructions from his imperious queen to fight the enemy\r\nwithin _three_ days, or resign, and to fight whether he was prepared or\r\nnot, passed the Parano in the beginning of February, and, on the 18th,\r\nattacked the Austrians under Count Traun, at Campo Santo, a town of\r\nModena, where another _drawn_ battle was fought, and both sides claimed\r\nthe victory. Count Gages found himself obliged to repass the river,\r\nand retire into Romagna, where he intrenched himself, and remained\r\nundisturbed till October, when Prince Lobcowitz, having assumed command\r\nof the Austrian army, boldly advanced, and drove him back on Fano. It\r\nwas at this crisis that Count Brown was sent by Maria Theresa to join\r\nher Austrians, whose ultimate object was the conquest of the Bourbonic\r\nkingdom of Naples, to punish its king for violating a _forced_\r\nneutrality, and having joined Count Gages with 25,000 men.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Empress-Queen engaged to maintain 30,000 men in Italy,\r\nprovided the King of Sardinia would pay another force of 45,000, while\r\nBritain was to send a naval squadron to co-operate by sea. Lobcowitz\r\nand Count Brown had established their head-quarters at Monte Rotondo,\r\nnear Rome, when their final orders arrived to invade the kingdom of\r\nNaples. Breaking up the camp, and marching towards Viletri, the prince\r\ndispatched Count Brown, with a division of German infantry and another\r\nof Hungarian hussars, to pursue the Spaniards (who began to retreat) as\r\nfar as the river Tronto, with the double purpose of harassing them and\r\nendeavouring to excite an insurrection among the wild mountaineers of\r\nthe Abruzzo. In fulfilment of his orders, Brown distributed everywhere\r\nmanifestos in the name of Maria Theresa, urging them to throw off the\r\nSpanish yoke, and place themselves under her protection, promising,\r\nat the same time, to banish for ever the obnoxious Jews from Naples;\r\nbut these proclamations were unheeded by the Abruzzesi, who evinced no\r\ninclination to revolt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his commander, Prince Lobcowitz, had halted in the marquisate\r\nof Ancona, being somewhat uncertain in which direction to march.\r\nPushing on, Count Brown crossed the Tronto, which separates the\r\nkingdom of Naples from the Papal territory. Entering, he gave all to\r\nfire and sword as he advanced. His route lay along the shore of the\r\nAdriatic by the high road to Naples, which crosses the river Potenza\r\nnear its mouth, and lies on the confines of Ascoli. He laid most of\r\nthe small towns in the Abruzzo under contribution. Some were fined in\r\nmoney--others in a certain quantity of barley bread; but his necessary\r\nseverity was greatly tempered by mercy. His advanced guard of hussars\r\nhad daily skirmishes with the Spanish cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe passes being deep with snow, so as to be almost impassable for\r\nartillery and baggage, Lobcowitz gave up all thought of entering Naples\r\nby the coast road, which was the only clear one, and very unwisely\r\nrecalled Count Brown with his forces; and as soon as they joined,\r\nbegan his march by the way of Umbria and the Campagna di Roma, with\r\n6000 horse and 20,000 foot. Among the former were 2000 hussars; among\r\nthe latter were some irregulars, or free companies of what Buonamici,\r\nin his _Commentaries_, styles \"Condemned persons and deserters, who,\r\ndespairing of pardon, and urged by the prospect of plunder, panted for\r\nan opportunity of coming to blows with the enemy.\" This small army\r\nadvanced in three columns, two days' march apart, that the people might\r\nnot be oppressed. Brown commanded the first. Advancing by Spoleto,\r\nTerni, and Narni, they reached Castellana, and held a council of war,\r\nat which Brown, the Cardinal Alessandro Albani, and the Bishop of Gurck\r\nassisted. A stormy debate ensued, and nothing was decided upon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the alarmed King of Naples, with the combined armies of\r\nNaples and Spain, was encamped on the hill of Anagni, in the Campagna\r\ndi Roma. The Spaniards under Count Gages consisted of eleven battalions\r\nof infantry, three regiments of cavalry, under the Duke of Atri, five\r\nhundred horse-archers, and three hundred of the Duke of Modena's\r\narcher-guards (archers, of course, but by name); with the _Irish\r\nBrigade_, and a regiment of hussar deserters. The Neapolitan army\r\nconsisted of eighteen battalions of foot and five regiments of horse.\r\nThe vanguard was composed of light-armed mountaineers. The artillery\r\nwas commanded by the veteran Conte di Gazola.\r\n\r\nLobcowitz and Brown now began their march towards Rome; crossed\r\nthe Tiber at Teverone, and halted at Marino, where of old stood\r\nthe villa of Caius Marius. After a great deal of severe marching,\r\ncounter-marching, and skirmishing, the prince resolved on assailing\r\nthe chiefs of the allies in their head-quarters, which they had\r\nestablished in Viletri; and this daring enterprise he committed to\r\nBrown, his most active and able general.\r\n\r\nIn Viletri, the King of Naples and the Duke of Modena, with most of\r\nthe nobles and officers of their troops, had quartered themselves,\r\nand taken every measure to secure and fortify the town, which is\r\nsituated upon a high mountain, surrounded by deep valleys, all\r\ndifficult of access, but beautifully planted with vineyards and\r\ngroves of olive-trees. It had several gates, a Minorite convent, and\r\na town-house, which crowned the summit of the hill. Charles of Naples\r\noccupied the noble palace of the Ginnetti family; adjacent to which\r\nwere spacious gardens, a lane, and a bridge, all guarded by soldiers,\r\nand barricaded, and planted with brass cannon. The gardens communicated\r\nwith the Valmonte road, and thereon were posted two battalions of the\r\nWalloon Guard. The custody of the Roman gate was committed to the\r\nRoyal Regiment of Horse, and the Duke of Modena's Life Guards, while\r\nat the foot of the eminence, to sweep all approaches, the most of the\r\nartillery were posted near the Capuchin convent. The right flank of\r\nthe town was occupied by Spanish and Italian infantry; the left by the\r\ncavalry, the Irish Brigade, and four battalions of the Walloon Guard.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians had intrenched themselves on a hill, only a mile distant;\r\nand there, by means of spies and deserters, Count Brown had accurately\r\ninformed himself of all the arrangements which had been made in\r\nViletri; but, brave as he was, on Prince Lobcowitz first proposing this\r\nhazardous duty to him, he was struck by the too evident desperation of\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\n\"The Austrian forces,\" said he, \"are insufficient for attempting\r\nso daring an enterprise; it is impossible to reach the Neapolitan\r\ncantonment undiscovered, and I do not think we could force it without\r\nimminent danger, and a warm reception. In my opinion, the easier and\r\nthe safer way would be to make a general attack with all our strength\r\nupon the enemy's works.\"\r\n\r\nBrown afterwards adopted the general's opinion, that a night attack\r\nwas best; and the time and manner he proposed met with the consent of\r\nall who were present at their conference.\r\n\r\nSelecting 6000 men, he chose the 10th of August for this desperate\r\nexpedition; and Lobcowitz, to conceal all knowledge of the route\r\nchosen by the count in attacking Viletri, threw a chain of picquets\r\nand videttes over a vast extent of country. In silence, and without\r\nthe sound of drum or bugle, he marched from the camp; and none of\r\nhis troops, save the Marquis de Novati, his second in command, were\r\ninformed of the object until they reached a valley at the foot of the\r\nmountain, near a church dedicated to St. Mary. The darkness of the\r\nnight (says Castruccio Buonamici) was rendered more dense by the shade\r\nof the overhanging vines.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, during a temporary halt, it was reported to the count\r\nthat a soldier had deserted, and perhaps to the enemy. The Marquis\r\nde Novati fearing they were betrayed, urged a retreat, but Brown\r\nexclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"No; I am determined to advance. The die of war has been thrown!\"\r\n\r\nAnd promising his soldiers ample rewards, he exhorted them to behave\r\nlike brave men. Pushing on with ardour, the attack was commenced just\r\nas day began to break, by the cavalry outposts being cut to pieces,\r\nand the left flank of Viletri being furiously assailed, the infantry\r\npushing on through walls and vineyards, and the Hungarian horsemen\r\nwith lance and sabre hewing a passage to the streets. A regiment of\r\nItalian dragoons were put to flight. The brave Irish Brigade attacked\r\nthe advancing Austrians with such fury, as to hold them in check\r\nfor half-an-hour, but in the end were nearly cut to pieces at the\r\nNeapolitan Gate. Marsiglia of Sienna, a Knight of Malta, defended\r\na cottage with fifty dismounted dragoons, and displayed incredible\r\nbravery. The Walloon Guards were unable to assist the Irish until\r\nthey were nearly all slain. Colonel Macdonel, eleven captains, thirty\r\nsubalterns, and a heap of Irish dead, blocked up the gate they had\r\ndefended. The fury, the firing, and the slaughter on all sides of the\r\nhill were frightful. The King of Naples put himself at the head of his\r\nguards, crying, \"Remember your king and your ancient valour.\" But his\r\nefforts were vain; the gates were all forced, his troops driven out,\r\nand nine of their standards taken. The street which led to the Ginnetti\r\npalace was set in flames; the Duke of Atri was nearly burned alive, and\r\nGeneral Count Mariano was captured in bed. Brown's second in command,\r\nthe Marquis de Novati, was taken prisoner, and finding his troops, who\r\nwere busy plundering, about to be surrounded by those of Count Gages,\r\nhe ordered his drums to beat a retreat, and retired to the intrenched\r\ncamp of Lobcowitz. In this expedition he killed and captured 3000 men,\r\nhamstrung 800 horses, and brought off 500 more laden with plunder; one\r\ngeneral, one hundred other officers, twelve standards, and three small\r\ncolours. His own loss was only 500.\r\n\r\nDisheartened by the partial failure of this affair--for the King of\r\nNaples had escaped them--destitute of forage for their cavalry and\r\nartillery, and encumbered with many sick and wounded men, Lobcowitz\r\nand Brown finding themselves unable to hazard a general engagement,\r\nand that autumn was at hand, became desirous of retreating; and after\r\npillaging Valmonte and cutting the Duke of Portocarrara's Italian corps\r\nto pieces, transporting their baggage and sick by sea to Tuscany, they\r\nthrew a pontoon bridge across the Tiber beside the Ponte Molle, and\r\ncommenced a retreat in the night, demolishing all bridges as they left\r\nthem behind, to bar pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe count was named \"the right hand\" of Lobcowitz during the arduous\r\noperations which ensued; and, by his usual activity and bravery,\r\nhe frequently repulsed the pursuing Spaniards on the retreat from\r\nViletri, during the fortification of the Austrian camp at Viterbo, the\r\nretreat from thence through the forests of Orvietto, with a force now\r\ndiminished to 13,000 men; the assault upon Nocera, where Count Soro and\r\n900 Italian deserters fell into the hands of Count Gages, who sent them\r\nin chains to San Giovanni, where every fifth man was shot--and many\r\nother similar affairs, until the Imperialists reached their winter\r\nquarters at Rimini, Cesano, and Forli, on which the Spaniards and\r\nNeapolitans retired to Pesero and Fano.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the following year, 1745, he was recalled from\r\nItaly by Maria Theresa, and sent into Bavaria at the head of a body of\r\ntroops against the young Elector, who was in alliance with France. He\r\ntook the town of Vilshosen by assault, and captured 3600 prisoners:\r\n2000 were slain on both sides, and 6000 Hessians were forced to lay\r\ndown their arms, and enter the British service for the campaign against\r\nthe unfortunate Prince Charles Stuart. The count would have performed\r\nmany other feats of equal brilliance, had the war against Bavaria not\r\nbeen terminated suddenly by the terrified Elector, who, at the same\r\ntime that Vilshosen was taken, lost Pfarrkirchen, Landshut, and had\r\nall his magazines destroyed, which compelled him to sign the treaty of\r\nFussen, and in April to conclude a peace with the Empress-Queen. In the\r\nsame year Count Brown was appointed General of the Austrian Ordnance.\r\n\r\nThough peace had been made with the Bavarian Elector, there was no\r\nrest for the soldier of fortune, who was immediately dispatched a\r\n_third_ time to Italy, with 18,000 men, against the Spaniards, by Maria\r\nTheresa, whose husband had now been elected Emperor of Germany. He\r\njoined the Prince of Lichenstein, who was carrying on the war against\r\nthe still-allied French and Spaniards under the Marshal de Maillebois;\r\nand one of his first essays in the new Italian campaign was to attempt\r\nthe recovery of the Milanese, out of which, solely by his activity, the\r\nallies were ultimately driven.\r\n\r\nHe also formed a daring scheme to cut off the communication between\r\nthe main body of the Spanish army and their forces under the Marquis\r\nde Castellar, by detaching General Nadasti along the left bank of the\r\nPo, with orders to amuse the enemy by countermarches, and by pretending\r\nto lay a pontoon bridge across the river at Casale-maggiore, a town\r\nin Lombardy. While the deceived Spaniards were busy watching these\r\nfeigned motions, their guards, who occupied the right bank of the Po,\r\nwere surprised and utterly cut to pieces by the Austrian irregulars;\r\nand then Count Brown crossed the river at Borgoforte, near the strong\r\nVenetian castle, and pushing on from thence, captured Luzzara, a\r\nParmese town four miles north of the scene of his services twelve\r\nyears before--Guastalla, which he immediately invested, and took by\r\nassault, when Marshal Count Corasin surrendered, with 2000 prisoners.\r\nAt this very time Castellar, with 7000 Spaniards, hovered on one flank\r\nof the count's little force, and Gages was advancing on the other; two\r\nmovements by which his division must have been overwhelmed, had not the\r\nPrince of Lichenstein advanced to his support; and on uniting they took\r\nParma.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Piacenza Brown performed one of his most brilliant\r\ndeeds, by destroying the right wing of the allies under the Marshal de\r\nMaillebois. This great encounter took place in front of the city, which\r\nstands on an extensive plain near the right bank of the Po; earthen\r\nramparts surround, and a castle protects it. Count Gages' army abounded\r\nin cavalry; and besides its natural strength, his position was defended\r\nby the cannon of the city; so there was no hope of starving him out of\r\nhis trenches--but battle was given on the 16th of June. The French, who\r\nhad encamped without the Antonian gate, formed in three lines, and were\r\nthe right wing of the enemy, with sixteen battalions of Spaniards under\r\nLieutenant-General Arambure; the centre consisted of nine battalions,\r\nthe flower of the Spanish infantry; the left were the regiments of\r\nNaples and Genoa.\r\n\r\nThe battle began at daybreak, and the Spaniards charged with such fury\r\nthat an Austrian battery, consisting of twenty-six pieces, was taken by\r\nArambure, who was dangerously wounded. Count Gages broke their left,\r\nwhen 250 gallant men of Prince Eugene's dragoons bore them back, and\r\nstruck a panic into the French, amongst whom the Marshal de Maillebois\r\nwas fighting on foot. These dragoons were led by Count Brown, and by\r\ntheir charge the Spanish and Walloon Guards were routed, trampled under\r\nhoof, and destroyed. The allies made a precipitate retreat. Two days\r\nafter the battle they were reviewed, and found to have lost 3220 who\r\nwere killed, 4460 wounded, and 915 prisoners. The Count de Brostel,\r\nGeneral of the French artillery, the Chevalier de Tesse, two Spanish\r\nlieutenant-generals, and the commander of the Swiss, were among the\r\nslain. Ten pieces of cannon and thirty pairs of colours were left upon\r\nthat sanguinary field, where the Austrians buried 3500 of their own\r\ndead. The King of Spain survived these tidings but a few days.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August the combined French, Spanish, and Neapolitan\r\narmies attempted to cross the Po at the Lombra and Tydone. Count\r\nSabelloni, with 7000 Austrians, made a noble stand against them, from\r\nnine in the evening till ten the next morning, when General Botta and\r\nCount Brown hastened to his relief, and the conflict began again with\r\nrenewed fury; and after a terrific cross fire of cannon and musketry,\r\nand a furious mêlée, in which Spaniard, Frenchman, Swiss, Italian, and\r\nAustrian soldiers were all mingled, with musket, sword and bayonet--no\r\nman valuing life or limb when compared with the glory of the day--the\r\nthree allies were driven back, leaving 8000 killed, wounded, and\r\nprisoners, with nineteen guns and twenty standards, on the field.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians lost General Barenclau (whose courage was ever rash) with\r\n4000 men. Counts Brown and Pallavicini were wounded. The Spaniards\r\nlost the flower of their officers, and among them the young and noble\r\nColonel Don Julio Deodato of Lucca, an accomplished cavalier and\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\nMarshal Maillebois and Count Gages retreated to Genoa, from thence\r\nto Nice, and from thence to Parma; abandoning Piacenza, of which the\r\nAustrians took immediate possession, and wherein they placed 9000 men,\r\nmost of whom were suffering from wounds received in previous battles.\r\nDespite his wound, Brown remained at the head of his division and with\r\nthe army which pursued the Bourbon allies towards Genoa, taking every\r\nplace by storm or capitulation on their route, except Tortona and the\r\nmandamento or fortified town of Gavi.\r\n\r\nOn the Austrian vanguard under Count Brown (who commanded during\r\nthe absence of Count Botta, the new commander-in-chief) reaching\r\nSanto Pietro d'Arena, a suburb of Genoa, the city became filled with\r\nconsternation, and the senators sent the Marshal di Campo Esceria\r\nto learn from him on what conditions he would receive the city. But\r\nfor some private reason Brown declined to admit him to an audience.\r\nRaynerio Grimaldi and Augustino Lomellino were next sent to the\r\nAustrian camp and the count demanded the object of their visit.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" they replied, \"the people of Genoa have made war on no\r\none, and least of all upon the Empress-Queen of Hungary, for whom\r\nthey have ever entertained a profound veneration. Had they been her\r\nenemies, would their ambassador have been at this very time in her\r\ncity of Vienna? Hard necessity forced us to embrace an alliance with\r\nthe Bourbons, and it was with no other view than to defend ourselves,\r\nfor we would be the vilest of mankind to suffer our Fatherland to be\r\ntaken tamely from us. There can be no reason now, noble general, to\r\ndistress those who have only armed them in their own defence, or treat\r\nas enemies the Genoese, who have committed no act of hostility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seigneurs,\" replied Count Brown, \"you have acted the part of our most\r\nbitter enemies, for without your assistance what could the united\r\narmies of the Bourbons have effected? You sent them auxiliaries! you\r\nsupplied them with provisions; and after six years' striving to cut a\r\npassage into Italy, it was _you_ Genoese, alone, who opened up a path\r\nto them, enabling them to essay the ruin of the Austrians in Venice and\r\nin Lombardy. Begone! and without loss of time inform your senate to say\r\nno more of friendship for the present, but submit to us on those terms\r\nwhich my friend, General Gorani, will lay before you in writing.\"\r\n\r\nLest Brown should have the entire glory of reducing Genoa, General\r\nBotta hastened from Novi to resume the command, and he also required\r\nthe immediate surrender of the city.\r\n\r\nThe allies having left 4000 men to defend the pass of La Bochetta,\r\nin the northern Apennines, a gorge which has always been considered\r\nas the key of Italy on the side of Genoa, and which is well defended\r\nby several redoubts, Count Brown advanced against it, and stormed\r\nthe ravine, though it is so narrow that in some places only three\r\nmen could march abreast. He attacked and routed another party on his\r\nway to Ponte Decimo; and after this, the Genoese, finding themselves\r\ncompletely abandoned, gave up all their gates, posts, and arsenals, and\r\npaid 50,000 genovines to the victorious Austrian troops. After this,\r\nCount Brown was appointed the generalissimo in Italy; and all thought\r\nof invading Naples having been completely laid aside for the time, it\r\nwas arranged by the British and Austrian ambassadors, in a conference\r\nwhich they held in Santo Pietro d'Arena, that without loss of time he\r\nshould make an invasion of Provence, into which the allies had retired.\r\nIn obedience to this desire, after detaching General Gorani (who soon\r\nafter was unfortunately killed) to fall upon the enemy's rear, and\r\nleaving the Marquis de Botta at Genoa with 18,000 men, he embarked\r\non board a squadron consisting of three ships and eight pinnaces,\r\ncommanded by the Scottish Captain Forbes, and sailing from Santo Pietro\r\nd'Arena, had a quick passage to Villa Franca, from whence he walked\r\non foot to Nice, a two days' journey. He was disguised, for in such a\r\ncountry, convulsed as it was by war, assassination, and disorder, every\r\nprecaution was necessary for personal safety.\r\n\r\nHaving waited on the King of Sardinia, and settled their plan of future\r\noperations, he waited at Nice only until Captain Forbes brought over\r\nthe Austrian artillery, &c., from Genoa, and until the forces collected\r\nfor him by the Sardinians were reinforced by the troops from Piedmont,\r\nMilan, Genoa, and those which had been blocking up Tortona; and while\r\nthey were collecting, at the head of a small force he reduced, by\r\nassault, Mont Albano, in the county of Nice.\r\n\r\nIn triumph, and in defiance of the French troops under the Marshal\r\nDuke de Belleisle, he passed the Var on the 9th of November, with\r\na fine army, consisting of forty-five squadrons of horse, and\r\nsixty-three battalions of foot--in all, 50,000 men. Among these were\r\ntwenty regiments of the Piedmontese. The wild Croats on their swift\r\ngrey horses, and the dashing Hungarian Hussars, clad in their brown\r\nuniforms, formed his vanguard; and fell with such fury upon the French\r\nwith their long lances and sharp sabres, that they swept all before\r\nthem; while the British sailors, under Vice-Admiral Medley, drove the\r\nenemy from Fort Laurette, and thereby secured his left flank. Thus\r\nsafely and victoriously he passed the Var, and entered Provence, the\r\nancient patrimony of the House of Anjou.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of a British bomb-ketch, he reduced and took 500\r\nsoldiers in the little isles of Saint Marguerite and Saint Honorat, on\r\nthe south-east coast of France, opposite to Antibes, which he invested\r\nby land, while Admiral Medley cannonaded it by sea. Leaving Baron Roth\r\nwith twenty-four battalions to press the siege against the Chevalier de\r\nSade, he made himself master of Draguignan, with the loss of 2000 men,\r\nlaid all the open country under contribution, and threw forward his\r\noutposts as far as the river Argens. During these arduous operations he\r\nwas seized by a fever, which confined him to a camp-bed, but he soon\r\nrelinquished it for his saddle.\r\n\r\nThe batteries opened against Antibes on the 20th of September. It was\r\ncannonaded for thirty-six days, and all its houses were demolished;\r\nbut on collecting a numerous army, the Marshals De Belleisle and De\r\nBoufflers advanced to its relief, while other forces, amounting to\r\n_sixty_ battalions, were hastening forward from Flanders. Meanwhile\r\nthe Genoese, driven to despair by the extortions and severity of the\r\nMarquis de Botta, resolved to break their Austrian fetters or die in\r\nthe attempt. The circumstance of a German officer striking an Italian\r\nwho refused to drag a mortar to which he was harnessed, kindled a\r\nflame; and all the Genoese rushed to arms, and forced the arsenals.\r\nThe city barriers were stormed, the Austrians driven out, and two\r\nregiments, who defended the gate of Santo Thomaso, were cut to pieces.\r\nAll these circumstances combined, obliged Count Brown to raise the\r\nsiege of Antibes, abandon the projected expedition against Toulon, and\r\nrepass the Var. This was executed on the 23rd January, 1747, but not\r\nwithout considerable loss, for his rear-guard was furiously attacked.\r\nOrdering a column of horse and foot into Lombardy to join Count\r\nSchulemberg, he lined the southern bank of the Var with his main body,\r\nand kept the French under the great Belleisle completely in check, till\r\nthe King of Sardinia secured all the mountain defiles, to prevent them\r\nfrom penetrating into Piedmont.\r\n\r\nBrown still continued that masterly retreat which excited the\r\nadmiration of all military men, and even of his enemy, the brave\r\nBelleisle, who followed him across the Var on the 25th May, and retook\r\nMont Albano, Villa Franca, and Ventimiglia, from his garrisons, driving\r\nback forty-six Piedmontese battalions with terrible slaughter at the\r\npass of Exilles, where the Chevalier de Belleisle (brother of the\r\nmarshal), Knight of St. John of Jerusalem, fell, pierced with three\r\nwounds. Meanwhile Brown, with a force diminished to 28,000, continued\r\nhis retreat towards Finale and Savona. The despatch, which was sent\r\nto him by Major-General Colloredo, detailing the affair at Exilles,\r\nwas published in the _London Gazette_. In Lombardy he ordered two\r\nintrenched camps to be formed; one to hold 14,000 men, to guard the\r\nbanks of the Tanaro; the other to hold 11,000, and guard the Po,\r\nnear Pavia; but fatigue and want of food soon compelled all to seek\r\nquarters for the winter. The King of Sardinia marched to Turin; Brown\r\nestablished his head-quarters at Milan, after winning the praise of\r\nall Europe by his skilful operations in Provence. While here, by the\r\nseverity of his remonstrance, he forced Marshal Schulemberg to abandon\r\nhis important enterprise against Bisignano, and draw off his division\r\nto assist the King of Sardinia in covering Piedmont and Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of that year he occupied by innumerable skirmishes and\r\nmovements in defending the Italian States of Maria Theresa; among these\r\n(after the great review at Coni) was the march upon the Dermont, the\r\nassault by the French upon Maison Meau, the attack upon forty-three\r\nFrench battalions who were intrenched near Villa Franca, and other\r\naffairs, until the peace so happily signed in 1748, when he was sent by\r\nhis mistress to Nice, where, in conjunction with the Duke de Belleisle\r\nand the Marquis de la Minas, he skilfully adjusted certain difficulties\r\nwhich had arisen in fulfilling the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In reward\r\nfor his many great and gallant services, the Empress-Queen now made him\r\nGovernor of Transylvania where he won the love and admiration of the\r\npeople by his justice, affability, and honourable bearing.\r\n\r\nIn 1752 he was made governor of the city of Prague, and commander-in\r\nchief of all the troops in the kingdom of Bohemia; and in the following\r\nyear the King of Poland, as Elector of Saxony, honoured him with the\r\nOrder of the White Eagle, the collar of which is a gold chain (to\r\nwhich a silver eagle is attached), and first worn by Udislaus V. on\r\nhis marriage with a daughter of the Duke of Lithuania. In 1754 he was\r\nraised to the rank of Marshal of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter five years of peace the clouds of war again began to gather on\r\nthe Prussian frontier, and Marshal Brown was summoned for the _last_\r\ntime to the field. A quarrel having ensued between the courts of Berlin\r\nand Vienna, the warlike King of Prussia became alarmed by the hostile\r\npreparations that were made along the Livonian frontier, and resolving\r\nto anticipate the designs of his enemies, in 1756 invaded Saxony, and\r\nmade himself master of Dresden. On the first tidings of this invasion,\r\nMarshal Brown put himself at the head of the army of Prague, and\r\nmarched to relieve the Saxons; but this movement was anticipated by\r\nFrederick, who left 40,000 men to continue the blockade of Pirna on the\r\nleft bank of the Elbe (where Augustus III. of Poland was shut up), and\r\npenetrated into Bohemia at the head of 24,000 soldiers.\r\n\r\nBrown encamped at Kolin, while his compatriot, Prince Piccolomini, was\r\nposted at Konigingratz. From Kolin he marched on the 23rd of September\r\nto the fine old city of Budyn, which was surrounded by walls, and\r\ncontains the ancient fortress of Hassenberg. Here he endeavoured\r\nto concert measures with the Saxons for securing their freedom; but\r\nFrederick, on being joined by another column of his army, under the\r\ngreat Scottish Marshal Keith, marched to encounter him.\r\n\r\nPassing the Egra, Count Brown encamped at Lowositz, on the Elbe, and\r\nnear the Saxon frontier, and there the King of Prussia came in sight\r\nof his army, in position, at daybreak on the 1st of October, with\r\n65 squadrons, 26 battalions, 102 pieces of cannon, which formed in\r\norder of battle as they advanced, in that steady manner for which the\r\nPrussians had now become so famous. The infantry were formed in two\r\nlines, and the cavalry in three in their rear. Frederick's right wing\r\noccupied a village at the foot of the Radostitz, a wooded mountain; and\r\non the Homolkaberg, in front of it, he had placed a battery of heavy\r\nguns; his left wing rested on the Loboschberg; and his centre occupied\r\nthe fertile valley between.\r\n\r\nThe high and steep face of the Loboschberg was covered by vines, and\r\nintersected by many stone walls. Among these Marshal Brown advanced\r\na large body of Croats, with several battalions of Hungarians to\r\nsustain them; a deep ravine and rugged rivulet lay between the army\r\nof Frederick and the Austrians, which consisted of 72 squadrons, 52\r\nbattalions, and 98 pieces of ordnance, being 70,000 men. Brown formed\r\nthem in two lines, with his horsemen on the wings. He planted cannon in\r\nthe village of Lowositz, and in redoubts on the level ground before it.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the morning, and during a dense fog, the battle began\r\nbetween the Prussian left and the Croats on the Loboschberg, who\r\ncontinued firing till noon, when Frederick, seeing that Brown's right\r\nwas his weakest point, marched from the summit of the mountain and\r\ndrove down the Croats and Hungarians from the vineyards into the plain\r\nand ravine below. The marshal, believing that the fortune of the day\r\ndepended on the retention of Lowositz, threw his retiring right wing\r\ninto the village, where it soon gave way. He then led forward his left,\r\nbut the infantry fell into confusion at the village of Sulowitz,\r\nbeing exposed to a dreadful fire of shot and shell from redoubts and\r\nfield-pieces, grape, canister, hand-grenades, and musketry, which mowed\r\nthem down like grass, and drove them back in disorder; the marshal then\r\nordered a retreat, which he conducted in so masterly a manner, that no\r\neffort was made to harass him. He fell back at three in the afternoon\r\nto a new position, so well chosen that Frederick dared not follow, but\r\ncontented himself with keeping his line behind the ravine of Lowositz,\r\nthough by sending forward a body of cavalry under the Prince of Bavern,\r\nhe turned the marshal's left flank, a manoeuvre which compelled him to\r\nrepass the Egra, and again occupy his old camp at Budyn.\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle of Lowositz, where the marshal left 4000 of his\r\nmen dead on the field, and in his retreat had to blow up his magazine,\r\nwhile the Prussians had only 653 killed and 800 wounded. Having failed\r\nto relieve the Saxons, he marched to Lichtendorf, near Schandau,\r\nto join the King of Poland, and made an attempt to force back the\r\nPrussians at the head of 8000 chosen soldiers; but the effort proved\r\nineffectual, and Augustus III. was compelled to capitulate, and deliver\r\n17,000 men and eighty pieces of cannon into the hands of Frederick--a\r\nmortification as bitter to the marshal as it was to the Polish monarch.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th he retired towards Bohemia. The Prussian hussars followed\r\nhis rear-guard, and put 300 Croats to the sword. For his services he\r\nnow received the Collar of the Golden Fleece--one of the first of\r\nEuropean knightly orders.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 a confederacy was completed to punish Frederick of Prussia for\r\nhis invasion of Saxony. France sent 80,000 men to the Rhine, under\r\nthe Marshal d'Estrees; 60,000 Russians threatened Livonia; the Swedes\r\ngathered on the Pomeranian frontier; and Maria Theresa mustered 150,000\r\nsoldiers, the most of whom were stationed in Prague, under Prince\r\nCharles of Lorraine and the Marshals Brown and Daun. The Austrians were\r\nthen formed into four divisions--one under Marshal Brown, at Budyn;\r\na second under the Duke d'Aremberg, at Egra; a third under Count\r\nKonigsegg, at Richtenberg; a fourth under Marshal Daun, in Moravia.\r\nUndeterred by this vast array against him, Frederick in April marched\r\nstraight upon Prague, and driving before him a column under Marshal\r\nSchwerin, attacked Brown at Budyn, before Daun's division could join\r\nhim from Moravia. On finding his flank turned, Brown fell back upon the\r\nBohemian capital, and Frederick, leaving one division of his army under\r\nMarshal Keith, followed him fast with the rest, and gave battle to the\r\nAustrians on the 6th of May, at dawn in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe Imperialists under Marshal Brown were 80,000 strong; his left\r\nwing rested on the Ziskberg towards Prague; his right on the hill\r\nof Sterboli. In the front were steep and craggy mountains, which no\r\ncavalry could climb or artillery traverse; but the deep vale at their\r\nfoot was lined by hussars and hardy Hungarian infantry. The battle was\r\ncommenced by Lieutenant-General the Prince of Schonaich assailing the\r\nAustrian right with sixty-five squadrons of cavalry; a movement which\r\nBrown skilfully repulsed by drawing off his cavalry from the left, and\r\noverwhelming the prince by the united rush of one hundred and four\r\nsquadrons. Thus outflanked, they were repulsed, after two charges,\r\nuntil General Zeithen hurled the Austrians back upon their infantry by\r\na magnificent charge of twenty squadrons of hussars.\r\n\r\nThe battalions of Prussian grenadiers were routed by a discharge\r\nof twelve-pounders loaded with musket-shot, and the noble Marshal\r\nSchwerin, who, seizing the colours, placed himself on foot at their\r\nhead, was shot through the heart; but his officers rallied the troops,\r\nand assailed the Austrian right, at the same moment that Frederick\r\nbroke through their centre, and drove it towards Prague. A desperate\r\nstruggle with the bayonet now ensued between the Austrian left and the\r\nPrussian right under Prince Henry: and Marshal Brown, while in act of\r\nissuing orders to an aid-de-camp, received a deadly wound in the body;\r\nand as he could ill brook the double mortification of a defeat and of\r\nresigning the command to Prince Charles of Lorraine, it became mortal.\r\nHe was compelled to leave the field, from which his right wing fled to\r\nMaleschitz, while the left followed the centre in hopeless disorder to\r\nPrague, leaving the victory to the Prussians, who by their own account\r\nhad 3000 killed and 6000 wounded (by another account, 18,000 killed),\r\n397 officers fell, many of them high in rank; 8000 Austrians were\r\nslain, 9000 taken prisoners, and 50,000 were shut up in Prague, while\r\nall the cavalry fled to Beneschau, and joined Marshal Daun. Such was\r\nthe terrible and disastrous battle of Prague, and seldom has the sun\r\nset upon such a scene of suffering or slaughter as the field presented,\r\nfor there were more than _twenty thousand killed and wounded men lying\r\nupon it at six in the evening_!\r\n\r\nMarshal Brown was conveyed by his soldiers into Prague, where he\r\nendured the greatest torture from his wound, which was aggravated by\r\nthe bitterness of being disabled at such a critical time. Thus by the\r\nagitation and bitterness of his mind it became fatal, and fifty-one\r\ndays after the battle he expired of mingled agony and chagrin, on the\r\n26th of June, 1757, at the age of fifty-two.\r\n\r\nThus died Austria's most able general and diplomatist--and one of\r\nIreland's greatest sons; one of whom she has every reason to be proud,\r\nfor he was the military rival of Frederick of Prussia, and of France's\r\nmost skilful marshals, and he filled all Europe with the fame of his\r\nexploits in the field and his talent in the cabinet.\r\n\r\nA magnificent monument was erected to his memory, and his titles\r\nand estates were inherited by his sons, of whom he left two by his\r\ncountess, Maria Philippina of Martinitz. One of these died at Vienna,\r\non the 1st May, 1759, a major-general in the service of Austria: he\r\nexpired in great torture, under wounds received in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMOIRS OF THE LACYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland has given to the armies of Europe five brave soldiers, all\r\nkinsmen of the name of _Lacy_--viz., Marshal Lacy, who overran the\r\nCrimea in the service of Russia, and was the fellow-soldier of the\r\ngreat Count Munich; Marshal Count Lacy, his son, the friend of Leopold\r\nDaun, and, like him, a distinguished general in the Septennial War;\r\nFrancis Anthony Count de Lacy, who died Captain-General of Catalonia:\r\nhis brother Patrick Lacy, Major of the Ulster Regiment in the Spanish\r\nservice; and his son, Louis Lacy, who fought with such bravery in the\r\nwars of the Peninsula, and was _Chef-du-Battailon_ of the Irish in 1807.\r\n\r\nAll those Lacys were of the old Irish family of Bruree, and their\r\nnative place originally was Athlacca, a parish in the county of\r\nLimerick, on the Maig. Many of this gallant race are buried there, in\r\nthe ancient churchyard, where an old tomb is yet extant, inscribed--\r\n\r\n \"John, Thomas, and Edward Lacy, 1632.\"\r\n\r\nThe family followed to foreign wars the fortunes of the exiled\r\nJames Fitz-James, Duke of Berwick, Commander of the first troop of\r\nIrish Horse Guards, and natural son of James II. of England and\r\nVII. of Scotland. He was married first to a daughter of the Earl of\r\nClanricarde, by whom he had a son, the successor of his titles and\r\nestates in Spain, and who also became the friend of the Lacys.\r\n\r\nThe first of the family who rose to eminence was Marshal Peter Lacy,\r\nwho entered the service of Russia, and commanded with such distinction\r\nand success against the Turks.\r\n\r\nHe served as a subaltern and regimental officer in the armies of Peter\r\nthe Great, and first learned the art of war in those sanguinary and\r\ndesperate conflicts between the forces of the Czar and those of Charles\r\nXII. of Sweden, against whom Peter made an alliance with the Kings of\r\nPoland and Denmark in 1699, and with whom his general, the brave Prince\r\nMenschikoff, fought so many battles in the early part of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736 Lacy had attained the rank of general in the Russian\r\narmy, under Anne Ivanowna (niece of Peter I.), who at that time\r\ngoverned the vast and barbarous empire of the Muscovites. Count Munich,\r\nwho, for her service, had left the army of the Elector of Saxony, was\r\nat the head of her troops. \"He was the Prince Eugene of Muscovy,\" says\r\nFrederick the Great; \"but he had the vices with the virtues of all\r\ngreat generals. _Lascy_ (the younger), Keith, Lowendhal, and other\r\nable generals, were formed in his school.\" Sir Patrick Gordon, a\r\nScottish soldier of fortune, had already disciplined the Russian army,\r\nand brought it from barbarism to an equality with others in Europe;\r\nand in the time of Lacy and Munich it consisted of 10,000 guards,\r\n60,000 infantry of the line, 20,000 dragoons, 2000 cuirassiers, 30,000\r\nmilitia, with Cossacks, Tartars, Calmucs, and other barbarians, in\r\nunnumbered hordes.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736 the differences between the Czarina Anne and her\r\nhereditary enemy the Grand Seignior, came to a crisis; and she declared\r\nwar, in consequence of the provoking outrages of the Tartars of the\r\nCrimea, and the neglect of the Sultan to her repeated remonstrances on\r\nthat subject; and the Emperor of Austria concerted with her the plan\r\nof the new campaign against Turkey. It was agreed that a Russian army,\r\nunder General Lacy (or _Lasci_, as it is often spelt), should march\r\nagainst the city of Azoph; that another Russian army, commanded by the\r\nCount de Munich, should penetrate to the Ukraine; while the Austrians,\r\nunder Count Seckendorf, should prepare to assault Widin, in Servia; and\r\nall these armies marched accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Khan of the Crimea was, in those days, a powerful prince, who paid\r\ntribute to the Sultan, though he was styled _Emperor_ by his Tartar\r\nsubjects, and, being descended of the Ottoman blood, had a claim to\r\nthe Turkish throne, on the extinction of the race of Achmet III. The\r\nsultans had the power of deposing them, and, being jealous of their\r\nrank and authority, allowed few of them to die at liberty. Thus most\r\nof the Khans of the Crimea have ended their lives in chains in the\r\ndungeons of Rhodez. Among his own people the khan could then, at any\r\ntime, command an army of eighty or a hundred thousand men; but darts,\r\narrows, and spears, with a few muskets, were their weapons, with wooden\r\nsaddles and stirrups. His revenues were, the tenth of all captives, a\r\n_black mail_ paid by the Poles and Muscovites, and twenty cart-loads\r\nof honey from the Moldavians. He had vast flocks, coined copper money,\r\nand maintained a guard of Janissaries, who bore his green and purple\r\nstandard. The Crimea then contained several great cities, and, besides\r\nmany noble monuments of the Genoese, was covered by the ruins of the\r\nGrecian age and power.\r\n\r\nLacy came in sight of Azoph in March, 1736. It stands on the left bank\r\nof the most southern branch of the Don, in a district full of dangerous\r\nswamps, and on an eminence, the only spot capable of bearing buildings\r\nin that bleak and barren district. The city was then of a square form,\r\nsituated at the foot of an acclivity, and having a castle of great\r\nstrength. Lacy attacked both town and castle with great vigour; and\r\nthough assailed by incessant showers of bullets, arrows, darts, stones,\r\nand other missiles, shot by its strong garrison of Tartars and Turks,\r\nhe took it by storm, after a twelve days' siege, and completely reduced\r\nit.\r\n\r\nField-Marshal Count Munich, with 100,000 men, was equally successful\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nLacy next forced the far-famed lines of Perekop, which, till then,\r\nhad been considered impregnable. They extended across the Isthmus,\r\nfrom the Euxine to the Palus Mæotis, and had been the labour of 5000\r\nmen for many years. The great ditch (from whence we have the name of\r\n_Perecopz_) was seventy-two feet broad by forty-two feet deep, and the\r\nrampart was seventy feet in height, from its base to the cope of the\r\nparapet. The town was defended by a castle, the residence of the Aga of\r\nthe Guards upon the Don and Dnieper, and by six great towers mounted\r\nwith cannon; but the whole of these ample fortifications were manned by\r\nan army which made the most pitiful resistance; for this Irish soldier\r\nof fortune forced them, sword in hand, at the head of his troops, cut\r\nto pieces all who resisted, and hewed a passage into the peninsula.\r\n\r\nHe took Bakhtchissari, which lies within twenty-two miles of\r\nSebastopol. It then contained about 4000 houses, a mosque with a fine\r\npalace, and many stately tombs where the khans were buried. Around it\r\nwere baths, gardens, and orchards; and near it, in the narrow valley,\r\nthere still stands the now deserted mausoleum of a famous Georgian\r\nbeauty, who was the chief wife of the Khan Khareem Gheraee.\r\n\r\nWhile Munich was marching towards Bessarabia, Lacy overran the whole\r\nCrimea, and ravaged the country with fire and sword, up to the northern\r\nslopes of the Tauric mountains; but being foiled before Kaffa (on the\r\nsea shore), which was defended by strong walls, two castles, and a\r\ngarrison under a bashaw, he was compelled, by the approach of winter,\r\nto retreat, after subjugating the whole country, and defeating more\r\nthan 20,000 Tartars in one pitched battle.\r\n\r\n\"General Lacy,\" says Smollett, \"routed the Tartars of the Crimea; but\r\nthey returned in greater numbers, and harassed his Muscovites in such\r\na manner, by intercepting their provisions and destroying the country,\r\nthat he was obliged to abandon the lines of Perekop.\" The great\r\nField-Marshal, Baron Loudon (descended from an Ayrshire family), served\r\nin this war, under Lacy, as a subaltern officer. Among the Scottish\r\nvolunteers who also served there, were Colonel Johnstone; the gallant\r\nGeneral Leslie, who, with all his soldiers, was destroyed on the Steppe\r\nby the Tartars; and General Balmaine, who stormed Kaffa.\r\n\r\nAfter these triumphant operations, Lacy entered the Ukraine, joined\r\nMarshal Munich, and together, in 1737, they laid siege to Oczakow, at\r\nthe mouth of the Borysthenes.\r\n\r\nOczakow, or _Dziar Cremenda_, had then about 5000 houses, a mosque,\r\na palace, with a number of tombs of the Crimean khans, which stood\r\namong their gardens and orchards. It had a castle, built by Vitolaus,\r\nDuke of Lithuania, and therein a Turkish garrison had been established\r\nsince 1644. Munich and Lacy assailed the town and castle on the\r\nlandward side; but towards the sea they were attacked by the cannon\r\nof eighteen galleys. The Muscovites carried all their approaches with\r\nsuch impetuosity and perseverance, that, in a few days, the Turks and\r\nTartars became filled with terror.\r\n\r\nAmong those who distinguished themselves particularly in this service\r\nwere, General the Honourable James Keith (brother of the exiled Earl\r\nMarischal of Scotland), who was dangerously wounded in the thigh, and\r\nanother Jacobite exile, Colonel Count Brown, a brave Irishman--\"A\r\nCatholic,\" says Tooke, \"who was compelled to seek his fortune in\r\nforeign countries, by the exertion of those talents which he would\r\nwillingly have dedicated to the service of his _own_.\"\r\n\r\nThe garrison, which consisted of 3000 Janissaries and 7000 Bosniacs,\r\nstoutly defended themselves; but Oczakow was carried by assault. A bomb\r\nset fire to the town, and blew up its magazine; Lacy and Munich seized\r\nthis opportunity to lead on their stormers, and, pressed by the foe\r\nbefore them and the flames behind, the Mussulmans were nearly all cut\r\nto pieces; but not before they had slain 11,000 regular troops and 5000\r\nCossacks by bayonet and scimitar.\r\n\r\nThe rapid success of these two generals against the Crim Tartars\r\nawakened the restless ambition of Austria; and the Emperor believing\r\nthat, if he assailed the Porte by the Hungarian frontier while the\r\nCzarina pressed her victorious arms along the shores of the Black Sea,\r\nthe Empire of the Osmanlies would be finally subverted, declared war,\r\nand to co-operate with his troops, the Count Brown[11] left Lacy and\r\nMunich, and marched into Hungary at the head of a Russian column. But\r\nthe hopes of the Emperor were frustrated! The Turks turned all their\r\nvengeance against him, defeated his generals, and besieged Belgrade.\r\nThe Austrian Field-Marshal Wallace was defeated at Crotska, and the\r\ngallant Earl of Crawford who served under him as a volunteer, received\r\na wound from which he never recovered. The troops of Brown were also\r\nrouted, and he was taken prisoner. The barbarous Osmanlies stripped\r\nhim quite naked, and bound him back to back with another prisoner for\r\nforty-eight hours. He was four times exposed for sale as a slave in the\r\ncommon market-place, and four times was bought by different masters,\r\nwho treated him with the greatest cruelty.\r\n\r\nHe gave out that he was a captain to lessen the price of his ransom,\r\nand in this deplorable condition was discovered by an Irish gentleman,\r\nwho communicated his story to M. de Villeneuve, the French ambassador\r\nat Constantinople, by whom he was generously ransomed for three hundred\r\nducats, and sent back to Russia, where he died a general and governor\r\nof Riga, in 1789, in his eighty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nThe reverses on the side of Hungary overbalanced the success of Lacy\r\nagainst the Crim Tartars; the Emperor lost heart, and the Czarina,\r\nthough victorious again at Choczim in Bessarabia, where, on the 31st\r\nAugust, 1739, the forces of Munich defeated the Turks and swept the\r\nright bank of the Dneister, fearing that she was about to lose her\r\nally, concluded a treaty of peace, by which Austria ceded to the Porte,\r\nBelgrade, Sabatz, the island and fortress of Orsova, with Servia and\r\nWallachia, while the Danube and the Saave were to be the boundaries of\r\ntheir empires; but the Czarina retained Azoph, the important conquest\r\nof Marshal Lacy, who, in obedience to her orders, demolished the walls\r\nand fortifications of the city. To commemorate the exploits of him\r\nand Munich, she ordered a medal to be struck, having direct reference\r\nto the war in the Crimea, which was thenceforward to be an independent\r\nstate. On one side of this medal was the legend--\r\n\r\n \"ANNÆ IVANOWNA, D.G., RUSSLE IMPECUTRIX.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other was an eagle, with the words--\r\n\r\n \"PACE EUROPÆ PROMOTA, TARTARIS, VICTIS, TANAI\r\n               LIBERATO, ANNO 1736.\"\r\n\r\nMarshal Lacy ended his days in honour, and a noble monument was erected\r\nto his memory; but his less fortunate compatriot, Marshal Munich,\r\nincurred the displeasure of their capricious mistress, and was banished\r\nfor twenty years to the most northern confines of Siberia. Recalled in\r\nhis old age by the Czar Peter III., he was made Governor of Esthonia\r\nand Livonia; but died at Riga almost immediately after receiving that\r\nappointment, in his eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH FRANCIS MAURICE COUNT LACY, one of the great captains of the\r\nSeven Years' War, was the son of the preceding.\r\n\r\nHe was born at St. Petersburg, in the year 1718, and learned the art\r\nof soldiering under the eye of his father, and in the camp of Marshal\r\nMunich, in the service of the Czarina Anne, during her Crimean and\r\nBessarabian campaigns.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty he was a captain, and to his knowledge and love\r\nof the art of war united a polished education, gained under the best\r\nmasters in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn 1740, on the accession of Maria Theresa to the Austrian throne,\r\nhe entered her service, with the permission of the Czarina, and\r\nthere, by his talents, courage, and gentle bearing won the esteem\r\nof his soldiers; thus he soon attained a majority, and then the\r\nrank of colonel. He served in the Italian campaign as aide-de-camp\r\nto Count Brown, and at Viletri, had three horses shot under him. He\r\ndistinguished himself still more at the siege of Maestricht, and\r\nobtained command of a regiment.\r\n\r\nIn the war of the Hungarian Succession, after the cowardice and\r\nextraordinary mismanagement of the Duke of Cumberland had covered the\r\nBritish army with disgrace in the Low Countries, by allowing it to\r\nbe outflanked at Khloster Seven, by failing to defend the position\r\nat Maestricht, and forcing it shamefully to capitulate, on the 8th\r\nof September, 1757, and thus abandon our ally, Frederick the Great\r\nof Prussia, that warlike monarch only pushed on the war with greater\r\nvigour. In this disastrous contest the activity and vigilance of\r\nCount Lacy soon recommended him to the notice of Leopold Count Daun,\r\na native of Bohemia, and son of Philip Lorenzo, Prince of Tiano, the\r\npupil of Kevenhüller; and he improved the good opinion of that great\r\nsoldier by his fascinating manner and courtier-like behaviour. The\r\nfriendship of Daun soon won him the rank of major-general; and as such\r\nhe commanded a brigade in his division, when, in 1757, conformable to\r\nthe defensive system taken by Russia, Austria, and Sweden, the army of\r\nthe Empress-Queen was broken into four great columns, to prosecute the\r\nwar against the Prussians, French, and Bavarians, the violators of the\r\nfamous Pragmatic Sanction.\r\n\r\nOne column, under the Duke d'Aremberg, was posted at Egra; a second,\r\nunder Marshal Count Brown, was posted at Budyn; a third, under Count\r\nKonigsegg, held Reichenburg; a fourth, under Marshal Daun, occupied\r\nMoravia.\r\n\r\nIn his column were the brigades of Lacy and Lowenstein, whom Frederick\r\nof Prussia styles \"two young officers who ardently sought to\r\ndistinguish themselves.\" Lacy was then in his thirty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nIn Lusatia, during the winter of 1756 and the spring of 1757, these\r\nofficers had given infinite trouble to the troops of Frederick. They\r\nhad frequently attacked, sword in hand, his post at Ostritz, a Saxon\r\ntown on the Queiss; at other times, his intrenchments at Hirschfelde,\r\na manufacturing town on the left bank of the Neisse, and also at\r\nMarienthiel. Hirschfelde, which was garrisoned by one battalion of\r\nPrussians, they assailed at four o'clock one morning, with 6000 men;\r\ntwo redoubts, which stood without the gates, each defended by two\r\npieces of cannon, were repeatedly taken and retaken; but after losing\r\n500 men, Lacy and his brother-brigadier retired, bringing off the\r\nPrussian guns as a trophy. These assaults were ineffectual, and many\r\nmen were slain. Among others fell Major Blumenthal, of the Prince\r\nHenry's regiment--a brave officer. The Prussian corps of Lestwitz\r\nat Zittace, and of the Prince of Bavern at Gorlitz were harassed\r\nby perpetual alarms; and such was the activity of young Lacy and\r\nLowenstein, that they kept them continually under arms, if not in\r\naction, during the winter months.\r\n\r\nAs a brigadier, Lacy bore a distinguished part in the battles of\r\nReichenberg and of Prague, and in all the operations consequent to\r\nthe invasion of Bohemia by Frederick the Great, whose policy it\r\nwas ever to keep the scene of his wars as far as possible from his\r\nown territory; thus his army entered the Bohemian frontier in four\r\ncolumns, from Saxony, Misnia, Lusatia, and Silesia, under himself and\r\nMarshal Keith; Prince Maurice, of Anhalt Dessau; Prince Ferdinand, of\r\nBrunswick-Bavern; and the aged Marshal Schwerin. The division of the\r\nlatter entered in five brigades, at five different places, and won the\r\ndangerous defile of Gulder Oelse from the Pandours, at the point of the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the Austrians were driven back before this sudden torrent of\r\nPrussian soldiers, who advanced against the position of Count Konigsegg\r\nat Reichenberg, where 28,000 men were formed in order of battle, under\r\ncover of strong redoubts, and among steep mountains covered with dense\r\nforests. But the lines were stormed and the Austrians defeated, with\r\nthe loss of 1000 killed, among whom were two counts, a prince, and\r\na general, while twenty officers, four hundred soldiers, and three\r\nstandards were taken as an augury of greater victories. On hearing\r\nof this defeat, Leopold Daun marched with all speed from Moravia to\r\nreinforce the main body of the Austrians, which, when joined by the\r\nregiments of Prague and Bavern, mustered 100,000 men. Making a feint\r\ntowards Egra (which drew off 20,000 Austrians in _that_ direction),\r\nthe King of Prussia and Marshal Keith marched against the other troops\r\nof the Empress-Queen; and, crossing the Moldau on the 5th May, turned\r\nthe flank of the Imperialists, under the famous Ulysses Count Brown,\r\nwhose steady defence made the Prussians waver and fall back. On this\r\nthe venerable Marshal Schwerin, then in his eighty-second year, stung\r\nby the unmerited reproaches of the king, who urged him to advance,\r\ndismounted in the marshy ground, and taking an infantry standard in his\r\nhand, cried, \"Let all brave Prussians follow _me_!\"\r\n\r\nBut at that moment an Austrian bullet pierced his breast; and falling\r\nthus, covered with years and glory, he closed a long career of faithful\r\nmilitary service; but the Prussian foot pressed furiously on, and after\r\nthree charges totally routed the Austrians, whose general, Count Brown,\r\nalso received his mortal wound, as already related.\r\n\r\nFinding the day irreparably lost, Count Lacy, Prince Charles of\r\nLorraine, the Princes of Saxony and Modena, and the Duke d'Aremberg,\r\nwith the remnant of their infantry, in all 50,000 men, took refuge in\r\nPrague, where the gallant Brown expired of his wound, on the 6th May.\r\nMeanwhile 16,000 cavalry fled to Marshal Daun, who had encamped at\r\nBohmishbrodt the night before the battle.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians followed up their victory with ardour; Prague, with\r\n100,000 souls within its walls, was invested closely; Frederick pushed\r\nthe blockade on one side, and Marshal Keith on the other. In four days\r\nthey had it completely surrounded, and cut off every means of supply,\r\nagreeably to the last words of Marshal Brown, who, when dying, said:\r\n\"Tell Prince Charles of Lorraine instantly to march out and attack\r\nMarshal Keith, or all is lost.\"\r\n\r\nLacy and others proposed to assail the Prussians in the night, with\r\n12,000 Austrians, who were to be sustained by all the Pandours and\r\nHungarian Grenadiers; and thus to hew a passage, sword in hand, through\r\nFrederick's lines, and relieve Prague of the multitude of soldiers\r\nwho were rapidly consuming the provisions of the people. An infamous\r\ndeserter informed the Prussians of this gallant design, and thus they\r\nwere all on the alert, when about two o'clock, in the darkness of a\r\nmisty morning, a fiery tide of armed men rolled out of Prague, and\r\nassailing Marshal Keith at the bayonet's point, pressed desperately\r\non towards the Moldau; but, after a fierce and desultory conflict, in\r\nwhich Prince Henry (Frederick's youngest son) had a horse shot under\r\nhim, the Austrians were routed, and Lacy and other brave leaders were\r\nforced to fall back into Prague, with the loss of many killed and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Prussian batteries opened, and in twenty-four hours\r\nthrew 300 bombs, besides many fire-balls into the town; its streets\r\nwere soon sheeted with fire, and men, women, and horses, with the\r\nsick and wounded, perished in vast numbers. The city burned for\r\nthree days; flames and starvation drove the citizens to despair.\r\nSeeing their loved Bohemian capital on the verge of destruction, they\r\nbesought Lacy, d'Aremberg, and other commanders, in the most moving\r\nterms, to surrender; but war had hardened their hearts, and instead of\r\ncomplying, they drove out 12,000 persons who were considered as a mere\r\nincumberance. These unfortunates were hurled back by the Prussians to\r\nthe walls of Prague, and thus the Austrians were soon reduced to eat\r\ntheir troop and artillery horses, forty of which were shot daily, and\r\ncut up for rations, or sold at four pence per pound to the wretched\r\npeople, who still perished hourly by fire, shot, and famine.\r\n\r\nTwo other sallies were made, and the Prussian camp was kept in a state\r\nof perpetual alarm. In this defence, so disastrous to the city, Lacy\r\nwas of incalculable service in harassing the Prussian trenches, by\r\nhis vigilance and restless bravery. Contrary to the advice of Keith,\r\nthe king, on the 13th of June, left a small force before Prague, and,\r\ndrawing off his main body, marched against Daun, who defeated him in\r\nbattle at Kolin, and forced him to leave Bohemia--a movement by which\r\nthe blockade of Prague was abandoned; and the imprisoned Austrians\r\nreceived their deliverer with inexpressible joy. Lacy and other\r\ngenerals issued out, with their breasts full of ardour and vengeance,\r\nand followed the retreating Prussians over the Saxon frontier, sabring\r\nall stragglers who fell into their power.\r\n\r\nTo narrate all the military operations in which Count Lacy bore a part,\r\nwould be to rehearse the history of the Seven Years' War. He owed\r\nhis elevation and high consideration as much to his own bravery and\r\nskill as to the patronage and friendship of Daun, who consulted him on\r\nevery occasion, and employed him in the execution of the most delicate\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThough by his vigour and decision he frequently urged Marshal Daun on\r\nmany a bold enterprise, he was possessed of great coolness and presence\r\nof mind. \"His ardour,\" says the historian of the House of Hapsburg,\r\n\"never exceeded the bounds of prudence, or hurried him into attempts\r\nwhich might incur the censure of his patron.\" He was of great service\r\nin drilling and training the Austrian forces to perform those new and\r\ndifficult manoeuvres of which Daun was the inventor; he was a strict\r\ndisciplinarian, a friend to order, and by his precept and example\r\nsucceeded in introducing a degree of economy into every branch of the\r\nAustrian military service.\r\n\r\nIn 1758 the King of Prussia commenced the new campaign, and entering\r\nMoravia, invested Olmutz. General Lacy was then of great service in\r\nprotecting the roads which led to Upper Silesia; and, when posted\r\nat Gibau with a large body of Austrians, he sent a detachment of\r\ngrenadiers to Krenau, where they harassed the Prussian rear-guard, till\r\nthey were driven back by Wied. When Frederick retired from Konigsgratz,\r\nLacy and St. Ignan followed him with 15,000 men, and had many severe\r\nencounters with the Putkammer hussars, who formed the rear guard of the\r\nPrussians.\r\n\r\nHe served valiantly at the great battle of Hochkirchen, when the\r\ngood old Marshal Keith, Knight of the Black Eagle, and Governor of\r\nBerlin, a general second to none in the Seven Years' War, was slain\r\nthat day, when lighting on foot at the head of the Prussian infantry;\r\nand here ensued an affecting incident. After the battle, his body\r\nwas shamefully abandoned by the routed Prussians, and stripped by\r\nAustrian stragglers. Thus it lay long on the field, undistinguished\r\nfrom the thousands of others which covered it. In this degrading\r\nsituation it was found by Lacy, who was riding over the ground, and\r\nwith whose father (old Marshal Lacy) the venerable Keith had served\r\nin Prussia, and by whose side he had been wounded in the Crimea. The\r\ncount recognised the body, says Dr. Smollett, by the large scar of a\r\ndangerous wound which General Keith had received _in his thigh_ at\r\nthe siege of Oczakow, and could not refrain from tears on seeing his\r\nfather's honoured friend lying thus at his feet, a naked, lifeless,\r\nand deserted corpse; and it must have been an interesting scene to\r\nwitness these two exiles--the young Irish Jacobite weeping over the\r\nold Scottish Cavalier--on that sanguinary field. Lacy had the body\r\nimmediately covered, and interred with the honours of war, in the\r\nadjacent churchyard, from whence it was afterwards removed to Berlin.\r\n\r\nLacy, with Daun and Loudon, bore a conspicuous part in the campaign of\r\n1760, particularly in those manoeuvres by which the King of Prussia,\r\nnotwithstanding all his skill and cunning, was frustrated in his\r\nSilesian operations.\r\n\r\nProposing to invade the Duchy again, he crossed the Elbe, on the 15th\r\nJune, and was joined by the Prince of Holstein. On this, Lacy, who had\r\nbeen watching them, drew in his outposts, and retired to Zehaila. On\r\nhis march Frederick passed very close to Lacy's camp, with his infantry\r\ncovered by only four regiments of Saxon horse. These drove in Lacy's\r\npickets; on which he shifted his ground to a position at the foot of\r\nthe hills of Bockerdorf and Reichenberg. Frederick made preparations\r\nto assail them on the morrow, and only waited for reinforcements under\r\nGeneral Hulsen; but Daun, who had crossed the Elbe at Dresden, and was\r\nhastening to the assistance of his friend, dispatched an officer to\r\nhim, with orders \"to shift his ground;\" and together they took up a\r\nnew position at Lausa, while Frederick occupied the place which Lacy\r\nhad left by three regiments of hussars, two of dragoons, and two free\r\ncorps, which were attacked, but unsuccessfully, by Lacy in the night.\r\n\r\nBoth armies, Prussian and Imperialist, began their march for Silesia\r\non the same day, each eager to anticipate and shut the other out.\r\nThe former marched by the way of Crackau; the latter marched through\r\nBischofswerder; and _en route_ Daun detached Lacy to Keulenburg, to\r\ncover his left flank; but Frederick attacked the young brigadier\r\nunexpectedly, and captured 200 of his rear-guard. The heat was so\r\nexcessive at this time that eighty men dropped dead on the march. Lacy\r\ncontinued to harass the Prussian rear, till at Salzforstien Frederick\r\nturned and attacked his Uhlans with four regiments of horse, who in\r\nthe first charge shot and sabred 400 men. At that time Lacy's whole\r\ncavalry were encamped at Rothen Nauslitz; but he brought them up by\r\nsuccessive troops--for here again he was taken by surprise--and a\r\ndesultory and destructive skirmish ensued, after which both parties\r\nseparated. Frederick now decided it was necessary either to follow\r\nDaun, who had already reached Silesia, or to rid himself at once of the\r\nresolute Lacy, who hung like a wolf upon his skirts, and encumbered\r\nevery movement. Thus, on the evening of the 8th of July, after making\r\na feigned movement towards Gorlitz, he suddenly broke into Lacy's\r\ncamp, and drove him beyond the defiles of Horta, where his Prussians\r\npassed the night, while the Austrians occupied the mountain of the\r\nWhite Stag. From this Lacy's small force was driven next day, and had\r\nto recross the Elbe at Dresden, from whence he marched to a position\r\nat Gros Seidlitz, while lines of circumvallation were drawn round the\r\ncity. A letter written by Daun to Lacy, containing all his plans of the\r\ncampaign, was intercepted here, and brought to Frederick, to whom it\r\nproved of great service.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of August, Lacy lost his tents and baggage when escaping an\r\nattack meditated by Frederick, who was baffled by the timely arrival\r\nof Daun at Hennersdorf. Marshal Loudon invested Breslau, but raised\r\nthe siege on Prince Henry of Prussia marching to its relief. Frederick\r\nthen made his memorable march to prevent the Russians from forming\r\na junction with Daun and Lacy; he passed five rivers, the Elbe, the\r\nSpree, the Neiss, the Quiess, and the Bober, though trammelled by\r\n2000 caissons and a ponderous train of artillery; but he was unable\r\nto bring Loudon to action before that general was joined by Lacy and\r\nDaun. The three leaders then encompassed his camp at Lignitz, and his\r\naffairs seemed desperate; for Daun, after a reconnoisance, announced\r\nto Lacy and Loudon his resolution of storming the Prussian position by\r\na night attack; but the subtle Frederick eluded them all, by suddenly\r\nand secretly passing the Elbe, and hastening into Saxony, whither Daun\r\nand Lacy followed him, at the head of 80,000 men. Then Cunnersdorf,\r\nthe bloodiest battle of the Seven Years' War, was fought and lost by\r\nFrederick. In that field he had 20,000 of his soldiers slain, and\r\nall his generals killed or wounded. He made incredible exertions to\r\nretrieve the day, and his uniform was riddled by musket-balls.\r\n\r\nThe Russians passed the Oder, and pushed a strong column into\r\nBrandenburg, under Count Czernichew, who was joined by a large body\r\nof Austrians under Lacy, and together they made themselves masters of\r\nBerlin, the capital, about the end of October. They levied a severe\r\ncontribution upon the citizens, destroyed all the magazines, arsenals,\r\nand foundries, pillaged the royal palaces, and ravaged all the adjacent\r\ncountry, burning a vast amount of property and military stores;\r\nbut they retired by different routes on hearing that the mortified\r\nFrederick was advancing to the relief of his plundered capital. And\r\nsoon after he had his revenge at the battle fought near Toorgau, on\r\nthe 23rd of November. There Lacy commanded the reserve of 20,000 men,\r\nwho covered the causeway and several ponds which lay at the extremity\r\nof Daun's position, and on which his left flank rested; Lacy endured a\r\nsevere cannonade at the beginning of the action. General Count O'Donnel\r\ncommanded the cavalry. When Daun gave way, Lacy brought up his reserve,\r\nand twice with the bayonet he strove desperately and heroically to\r\nregain the day, but was twice driven back by the Prussians; nor did\r\nhe abandon that disastrous field until half-past nine in the dark\r\nNovember evening. By that time Daun, after receiving a shot in the\r\nthigh, had been borne away wounded, and O'Donnel had assumed the\r\ncommand of the broken and discomfited army.\r\n\r\n\"Although I have been in twenty-eight battles,\" says a Swiss officer,\r\nwhose letter appears in a Scottish newspaper of the time,[12] \"I never\r\nsaw anything more dreadful than the field presented. It was near six\r\no'clock, a most obscure night--to use the words of Harlequin, _a night\r\nof ink_--the only light we had was the infernal fire of the artillery\r\nand musketry, the horrid noise of the combatants rendered more dreadful\r\nby the night; the melancholy cries of the wounded, mixed with the sound\r\nof drums and trumpets, filled the soul with horror. _Kill! Kill!_ was\r\ncried out everywhere. In a word, I never saw anything that better\r\ncorresponded with the melancholy idea given us of hell itself!\"\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, despite their 200 pieces of cannon, were routed and\r\ndriven over the Elbe; 10,000 of them lay slain on the field, and\r\nfour generals, 200 other officers, and 8000 men were taken, with\r\ntwenty-seven stand of colours, and fifty guns, for of all Frederick's\r\nvictories this was the most successful and glorious. He recovered\r\nall Saxony except Dresden, in the neighbourhood of which an Austrian\r\ndivision, under General MacGuire, another Irish soldier of fortune, was\r\nhovering. The troops of the Empress-Queen evacuated Silesia, while the\r\nRussians abandoned Colberg and retired into Poland; and thus closed the\r\nyear 1760.\r\n\r\nLeaving Lacy to watch the Prussian general Zeithen, Leopold Daun,\r\naccompanied by his countess, repaired to Vienna, and so soon recovered,\r\nthat in the spring of the following year he was able to assist at the\r\ncouncils of war. Fifty thousand men were now prisoners on both sides.\r\nIn February, 1761, Lacy, now a field-marshal, meant to have visited\r\nFinland (where his father had received extensive estates), to settle\r\ncertain family disputes which had arisen; but the preparations for\r\nanother campaign, and the knowledge that his old friend Daun was about\r\nto resume the command, made him defer this journey for a time.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of March, Marshal Daun departed from Vienna to join the\r\narmy, and all the generals repaired to the head of their different\r\nbrigades and divisions, for it was intended that the greatest efforts\r\nshould now be made to crush the warlike King of Prussia. Daun took\r\nthe command in Saxony; Marshal Count Loudon in Silesia, where he\r\nwas to be supported by the Russians under Marshal Butterlin, whose\r\ntrain of artillery was tremendous. It consisted of no less than\r\neight ninety-six-pounders, twenty-two forty-eight-pounders, seventy\r\ntwenty-four-pounders, eighty-three twelve-pounders, eighty-six\r\neight-pounders, and 106 lighter field pieces, drawn by 13,834 horses.\r\n\r\nO'Donnel marched with 16,000 men to Zittau, from whence he was to\r\nassist the armies of Saxony or Silesia, as occasion might require, and\r\nhe pushed one division as far as Dresden.\r\n\r\nIn June, Lacy's corps took post on the right bank of the Elbe, to\r\npreserve a communication with the division of his countryman. Several\r\nother Irishmen had high rank in the Austrian service about this\r\ntime, and we may particularly note Nicholas Count Taaffe, who died a\r\ncolonel-commandant in 1770, aged ninety-two, and was succeeded in his\r\ntitle and regiment by his son, Count Francis; and Count O'Rourke,[13]\r\nKnight of St. Louis, descended from an ancient family in the county of\r\nLeitrim, whose ancestors Cromwell is said to have stripped of an estate\r\nworth 70,000_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nOn the Prussians, under Prince Henry, passing the Elbe in July, Daun\r\nreinforced Lacy with six battalions and some regiments of horse.\r\nIn spite of their utmost efforts, Frederick, after fighting the\r\nImperialists on the heights of Buckersdorf, where an Irish officer\r\nnamed O'Kelly ably defended their redoubts with only 4000 men,\r\nrecovered the city of Schweidnitz on the 22nd July, though defended by\r\n9000 men, under _another_ Irish general named Butler. He then turned\r\nhis eyes towards Saxony, and proposed to besiege Dresden.\r\n\r\nAfter Loudon entered Silesia in August, some severe fighting ensued,\r\nespecially at Munsterberg, and on the hills of Labedau. Lacy was\r\nthen hovering with his troops near Grossenhayn, and encamping at\r\nGros-dobritz, from whence he advanced his videttes as far as Strehlen\r\nalong the Elbe--for Count O'Donnel still occupied Dresden or its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn September, Lacy was sent with his brigade, 15,000 strong, by Daun,\r\nto join the Russians at Brandenburg, with orders to ravage all the\r\nelectorate, which, while covered by the army of Soltikoff, he did\r\nso effectually as to compel Frederick either to shift his camp from\r\nBuntzelwitz, on which he had 466 guns with 182 mines, or to weaken his\r\narmy by sending out detachments to protect the burning country. In\r\ndoing the latter some of Prince Henry's cavalry were severely cut up by\r\nLacy's dragoons in a forest near Reisa; and to avoid such unpleasant\r\nsurprises in future, the Prussians cut down all the magnificent timber\r\nthat surrounded the old castle of Hubertsbourg; but on Lacy's nearer\r\napproach they retired to Potsdam and Spandau. In October, Prince Henry\r\nof Prussia and Marshal Daun were both encamped--one under the walls\r\nof Dresden, and the other under the ramparts of Meissen, while their\r\nhussars and light troops fought together hourly, and Lacy hovered\r\nin the neighbourhood of Lusace, watching some large detachments of\r\nPrussians.\r\n\r\nIn December he again terrified the inhabitants of the capital by\r\nappearing suddenly within seven miles of Berlin; but on an overwhelming\r\nforce under General Bandemer being sent against him by Prince Henry, he\r\nrecrossed the Elbe and retreated.\r\n\r\nFortunately in 1762 there was concluded with the Court of Vienna a\r\ncessation of hostilities for the provinces of Saxony and Silesia.\r\nThis partial truce induced the Princes of the Empire to sign a treaty\r\nof neutrality to save their petty dominions from the ravages of\r\nFrederick; and as Sweden and Russia, on the accession of the Czar\r\nPeter III, had concluded a truce with him, the Septennial War was thus\r\nleft to be finished by the two powers which began it--Prussia and\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nIn that year the Khan of the Crimea proposed to join the former,\r\nand indeed marched 5000 men towards the frontier of Poland for that\r\npurpose; but the death of the Czarina Elizabeth, and the consequent\r\nrevolution in Russia, had so bewildered the poor Tartar, that not\r\nknowing what side to take, he timidly retreated to Perekop. On this\r\nFrederick recalled the Prince of Bavern from Moravia, with his troops,\r\nthat together they might make doubly sure of Schweidnitz.\r\n\r\nThey joined forces, and the prince encamped on the heights of Peilau.\r\nScarcely had this junction been effected before the Austrians, under\r\nDaun, Lacy, and O'Donnel, entered among the mountains on the 16th of\r\nAugust, 1762, and after a skirmish at Langan Bielau, encamped with\r\nforty battalions and forty squadrons close by; while General Beck,\r\nanother Imperialist, occupied the Kletchberg with twelve battalions\r\nand twenty squadrons. All night the Prussians were under arms; their\r\ncavalry bitted and saddled, their muskets loaded, and port-fires\r\nlit; every trooper slept beside his horse, and each gunner by his\r\ncannon. Daun assailed the Prince of Bavern in his position with great\r\nimpetuosity. Lacy passed the village of Peilau with six battalions,\r\nwhich he skilfully kept concealed behind a hill whereon his artillery\r\nwere posted. To cover his left flank, O'Donnel marched forty squadrons\r\ndirectly from Peilau, and three times his Imperial cuirassiers were\r\nrepulsed from the valley, and by a volley of grape from fifteen\r\nsix-pounders his confusion was completed. O'Donnel, with the loss of\r\n1500 dragoons, fell back, and thus exposed the left flank of Lacy, who,\r\nafter making great efforts to storm the heights occupied by the foe,\r\nwas compelled to retreat; and next day Daun retired by Wartha and Glatz\r\nto Scharfneck, where he remained till the close of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThis was the last military service of importance performed by Marshal\r\nCount Lacy at that time; for soon after, the war came to a close, by\r\nthe treaty of peace, signed in February, 1763, by which it was agreed\r\nthat a mutual restitution of conquests and oblivion of injuries should\r\ntake place; and that Prussia and Austria should be put in the same\r\nposition as when the hostilities began; and thus happily ended this\r\ntruly atrocious strife, in which nearly NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOLDIERS\r\nPERISHED. Prussia fought ten pitched battles, and lost 180,000 men;\r\nRussia, four great battles, and lost 120,000 men; Austria, ten battles,\r\nwith the loss of 140,000 men; France lost 200,000; Britain, 165,000;\r\nSweden, 25,000; and the Circles 28,000; while Austria found herself\r\nencumbered by one hundred millions of crowns of debt!\r\n\r\nFor fourteen years Lacy led a life of peace, devoting himself to the\r\ndevelopment of discipline in the Austrian army, till the death of the\r\nBavarian Elector, on the 30th December, 1777, opened up a new prospect\r\nof aggrandizement to the Imperial Government, and again lighted the\r\ntorch of war in Germany. The Elector Palatine, the Elector of Saxony\r\nand Duke of Mechlenburg-Schwerin laid claim to the vacant Electoral\r\nhat; but their voices were lost when the formidable and covetous House\r\nof Hapsburg also put forth a demand, and the Emperor Joseph and Marshal\r\nLacy appeared with 100,000 men, and an immense train of artillery, at\r\nthe celebrated position of Konigsgratz, above the confluence of the\r\nAdler and the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians and Saxons broke into Bohemia, and compelled Loudon\r\nto retreat, and a year of the old manoeuvring war and devastation\r\nfollowed, till the Congress of Teschen, by which Charles Theodore,\r\nElector Palatine of the House of Neuberg, obtained the Bavarian hat,\r\non the 13th May, 1779. The Emperor was compelled to relinquish his\r\nunjust claims, and tranquillity was restored to Germany, enabling Count\r\nLacy, then in his sixty-first year, once more to sheath the sword; and\r\nthis command which he held in the Bavarian dispute was the last act of\r\nimportance performed by him in the service of Austria.\r\n\r\nHe had now the rank of Field-Marshal, which at the age of thirty-six\r\nhe had declined, on the plea that his achievements were unworthy of it.\r\nHe had the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa; he was a member of the Aulic\r\nCouncil, Chief of the Staff, and General of the Ordnance.\r\n\r\nDuring his command-in-chief of the Austrian army, the following\r\nromantic incident occurred.\r\n\r\nA young Neapolitan noble, who, by war or gambling, had been reduced to\r\npoverty, became anxious to obtain military employment in the service of\r\nAustria; and on being furnished with a letter of introduction to Lacy\r\nfrom another soldier of fortune who served in the army of Ferdinand\r\nIV., he travelled on foot towards Vienna. He reached the Austrian\r\nterritories almost penniless, and one evening found himself at a poor\r\nwayside inn, not far from the capital. In the drinking room he met\r\nthree officers who were also travelling towards Vienna; and they, with\r\nthe frankness of German soldiers, invited the stranger to sup with\r\nthem, and in the course of the evening he told them what were his views\r\nand wishes, and that all his hopes depended upon Lacy.\r\n\r\n\"I regret to say that your plan is a bad one,\" said one of the Austrian\r\nofficers who wore the cross of Maria Theresa; \"we have had a long\r\npeace, and so many of our young nobility are crowding to Vienna in\r\nsearch of military employment, that I fear there is little likelihood\r\nof Marshal Lacy being able to befriend a stranger.\"\r\n\r\nUndeterred by this, the young Italian said that he was resolved to\r\npersevere; and he added an account of himself, of his family, their\r\npast importance and services in war, of his present necessity and\r\ncircumstances; and all this was related with a candour and modesty\r\nwhich so pleased him who appeared the senior officer, that he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, since you are resolved to try your fortune at Vienna, I\r\nwill give you a letter to the Marshal Lacy; it may prove of use to you,\r\nfor he knows me well.\"\r\n\r\nFurnished with this additional credential, the Italian reached Vienna.\r\nHe waited on Lacy and presented his papers; all, at least, save the\r\nAustrian officer's letter, which unfortunately he had mislaid. Lacy\r\nread them, and frankly told him that to grant what he wished was\r\nimpossible. Crushed by this, the Italian retired in desperation, for\r\nthe state of his funds could ill brook delay. Three days elapsed, until\r\nchancing to find the letter he had obtained so peculiarly at the inn,\r\nhe again presented himself at the levée of Lacy and delivered it. The\r\nmarshal opened it, and on reading the contents, his face expressed the\r\nutmost astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"How comes it, sir,\" said he, with severity, \"that you did not deliver\r\nthis letter to me sooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it was mislaid; and from the casual manner in which it was\r\nreceived, I deemed it of little value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know from whom it comes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Italian; \"but the writer wore the gold cross of Maria\r\nTheresa.\"\r\n\r\n\"That officer with the gold cross was _the Emperor_--Joseph II. You\r\nask me for a subaltern's commission, and he desires me to give you the\r\nrank of captain in a newly-raised regiment, and I have much pleasure in\r\nobeying his orders.\"\r\n\r\nThis young volunteer died a colonel of Hussars, and fell in battle\r\nagainst Custine, on the Upper Rhine, in 1792.\r\n\r\nLacy's plans of military reform won him a high renown in the Empire,\r\nto which he extended the mode of defence previously employed with\r\nsuch success upon the frontiers of Bohemia. He established the\r\ngreat fortress of Koningsgratz, and strengthened the defences of\r\nTheresienstadt and Josephstadt, which are still the admiration of all\r\nengineers. He regulated the war finance by a system of economy, still\r\nremembered with gratitude in Austria. True and faithful to the land\r\nhe served, he was ever ready to sacrifice his personal interests and\r\nfeelings for the good of the State. Of this he gave a prominent example\r\nin 1788, when Joseph II., having experienced only reverses in his\r\ncontest with the Porte, was recommended by Lacy to entrust all to Baron\r\nLoudon (with whom he had ever been on terms of coldness), as being the\r\n_only general_ capable of repairing the misfortunes of the war.\r\n\r\nFinding his health failing, he visited the Spa at Baden, and on his\r\nreturn to Vienna died, full of years and honours, on the 28th November,\r\n1801.\r\n\r\nHe bequeathed to the Archduke Charles an extensive park in the\r\nenvirons, with a request that the people should have free use of it.\r\n\r\nHe had enjoyed the trust and confidence of Maria Theresa, of Francis\r\nI., and of Joseph II., to the full; and until he became enfeebled by\r\ntime and wounds, he had more State patronage than any other subject\r\nin the empire. Frederick the Great had the highest esteem for his\r\ncharacter as a soldier, and pronounced him the first tactician of the\r\nage, and assuredly the King of Prussia was no mean authority. They had\r\noften met in the field. With his characteristic acuteness, Frederick\r\nthus spoke of the two greatest generals against whom he led the\r\nPrussian armies.\r\n\r\n\"I _admire_ the dispositions of Lacy, but I _tremble_ at the onset of\r\nLoudon!\"\r\n\r\nLoudon, his companion and rival--of whom elsewhere--ended his career\r\nvictoriously, after defeating the Turks and capturing Belgrade with the\r\nsame soldiers whom Lacy had led to many a battle-field.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS ANTHONY COUNT DE LACY, the celebrated Spanish general and\r\ndiplomatist, was the next member of this Irish family who attained an\r\neminent position in the history of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Spain, whither his father had followed the Duke of\r\nBerwick, in 1731, and after receiving the usual rudiments of education,\r\ncommenced his military career at the early age of sixteen, in the brave\r\nold Irish regiment of Ulster infantry, then in the service of his Most\r\nCatholic Majesty Ferdinand VI., who had succeeded his father, Philip\r\nDuke of Anjou, on the Spanish throne, in the preceding year, 1746.\r\n\r\nFrancis Anthony Lacy served with this regiment in the Italian campaign\r\nof 1747, which was undertaken to advance the claims of the Spanish\r\nBourbons to the crowns of Naples and Sicily, and to the Duchy of Milan,\r\nwhich had been claimed by Philip V., as successor to the House of\r\nAustria; while he also demanded Parma, Placentia, and Tuscany, in right\r\nof his queen, though he had been obliged to relinquish them _all_ by\r\nthe solemn treaty of Utrecht; but such is the faith kept by princes.\r\n\r\nThe Irish regiment of the young Count Lacy was with the army of the\r\nCount de Gages, the Spanish commander-in-chief, who had then under his\r\norders the combined armies of Spain and Naples. Genoa had revolted\r\nagainst the Austrians; Marshal Boufflers had entered it at the head\r\nof 4500 Frenchmen, and thus encouraged, the Genoese resolved to die,\r\nrather than submit to the tyranny of the House of Hapsburg, whose\r\narmies made incredible exertions to recover it. Then ensued the passage\r\nof the Var by the Marshal Duke de Belleisle; the storming of Montalbano\r\nand other places; the investment of Genoa by the Austrians and\r\nPiedmontese, and other operations of that extensive campaign, in which\r\n_le Régiment Irlandais d'Ultonie Infanterie_ bore a most prominent\r\npart, more so, perhaps, than their enemies relished, till the naval\r\nvictories of the British Admirals Anson and Warren in the East Indian\r\nOcean, and those of Fox and Hawke elsewhere, forced Louis XV. and his\r\nallies to listen to those proposals by which peace was secured to\r\nEurope by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, on the 7th October, 1748.\r\n\r\nPassing through all the successive grades with honour to himself, Count\r\nLacy, in his thirty-first year, obtained the colonelcy of the Ulster\r\nregiment, and, at its head, served in the war against Portugal in 1762,\r\nwhen Charles III. of Spain added to the calamities of his unfortunate\r\nneighbour Don Joseph, by invading his small dominions with a powerful\r\narmy, which threatened with still further destruction his hapless city\r\nof Lisbon--then recently ruined by the great earthquake. One Spanish\r\ncolumn, under the Marquis de Sarria, entered Portugal on the north;\r\na second, under the Count O'Reilly, took Chaves; a third entered by\r\nBeira and spread along the Tagus. This wanton invasion was suggested\r\nto Spain by France, as a means of insulting an ally of their common\r\nfoe--Britain--and also of extending by conquest the power of the Houses\r\nof Bourbon.\r\n\r\nBritain supplied Portugal with arms, ammunition, and 10,000 men, under\r\nBrigadier General Burgoyne, who skilfully co-operated with the Count de\r\nla Lippe, a German, and with General Forbes, a Scot, who commanded the\r\narmy of Don Joseph. Two regiments of Catholics were raised in Ireland\r\nespecially for this service, and these are still existing in the\r\nBritish line.\r\n\r\nIn all the operations of this war Lacy acquitted himself with the\r\ngreatest honour.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, he was appointed Commandant of the Spanish Artillery, and as\r\nsuch was employed at the famous Siege of Gibraltar, and was present\r\nwith the army which, under the Duke de Crillon (the conqueror of\r\nMinorca), made \"the last desperate and unparalleled efforts\" to restore\r\nthe key of the Mediterranean to the hands of King Charles III.\r\n\r\nGeneral Elliot of Stobs, in Midlothian, with 7000 men, valiantly\r\ndefended the rock against 40,000 soldiers who assailed it by land with\r\n200 pieces of cannon: and against the combined fleets of France and\r\nSpain, forty-seven sail of the line, seven three-deckers (the strongest\r\nthat had ever been built), eighty gunboats, and a swarm of frigates\r\nand smaller vessels, which opened a shower of shot from 400 pieces of\r\ncannon against him.\r\n\r\nThe first shot was fired on the 12th January, 1780, and it killed a\r\nwoman in Gibraltar. The Spanish camp was crowded by French _noblesse_\r\nand Spanish hidalgos, who had all hastened there to behold the _fall_\r\nof this great fortress.\r\n\r\nUnder Lacy, the Spanish artillerists fired with great precision and\r\neffect; but the determined old General Elliot defended Gibraltar\r\nwith the most obstinate bravery; and General Boyd (his countryman)\r\nrecommended, for the first time, a discharge of red-hot balls, which\r\nhad the most disastrous effect upon the Spaniards by land and sea; for\r\nat least 1500 of them perished. The British fired 716 barrels of powder\r\nand 8300 rounds of cannon-balls (more than half of which were _red\r\nhot_) between the time of firing the first cannon and the _last_, on\r\nthe 2nd February, 1783, when the French and Spaniards were completely\r\ndiscomfited, and a peace was signed, which ceded the fortress to\r\nBritain for ever.\r\n\r\nFor his services Lacy obtained the Grand Cross of Charles III., and the\r\nrank of Commander of the Cross of San Iago, an old Spanish order of\r\nchivalry instituted by King Ramiro, in commemoration of a victory over\r\nthe Moors, in 1030--their badge is a red cross in the form of a sword.\r\nHe was also made Titular of the rich Commanderie of _Las Cazas Buenas_,\r\nat Merida, in Estramadura.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace between Spain and Britain was firmly established, he\r\nwas sent successively as plenipotentiary to Gustavus III. of Sweden,\r\nand to the Empress Catherine II. of Russia (widow of the Czar Peter\r\nIII.); and the success he obtained in his embassies proved that he had\r\nsecured for himself and his royal master the love and esteem of the\r\ncourts of Stockholm and St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nImmediately on his return fresh honours were heaped upon him; he was\r\nnamed, _par interim_, Commandant General of the Coast of Granada and\r\nMember of the Supreme Council of War; then Lieutenant-General of the\r\nSpanish Army, Commandant of the Corps of Royal Artillery, and sole\r\nInspector-General of that branch of the service. He was also made\r\nInspector-General of the manufactories of arms, cannon, and all the\r\nmunitions of war throughout Spain and the two Indies.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of an unlooked-for _émeute_ in Barcelona the governor of\r\nwhich had not fulfilled his trust, in March, 1789, Lacy was appointed\r\nto the important and arduous office of Governor and Captain-General of\r\nthe Province of Catalonia. The Catalonians, who had long resisted the\r\nauthority of the kings of Spain, and had frequently risen in arms to\r\nassert their independence and choose princes of their own, were still\r\nliable to partial insurrections against the viceroys, to whose yoke\r\nthey submitted with sullen apathy, while they treated their monarchs\r\nwith hatred and contempt, till the conciliatory visit of Charles IV.\r\nBut Lacy contrived to win the love and esteem even of those sullen and\r\njealous provincials, and in every step of his career gave constant\r\nproofs of disinterestedness, skill, and devotion to the king and\r\ncountry of his adoption.\r\n\r\nHe seconded with great energy the measures taken by the Spanish\r\nGovernment to prevent the principles of the French revolutionists from\r\ncrossing the Pyrenees. \"Et fut reconduire sur la frontière le consul de\r\nFrance, qui avoit tenu des propos indiscrets à Barcelone. Par le même\r\nmotif,\" adds a French writer, \"Lacy retenait dans catalogue les emigrés\r\nFrancois.\"\r\n\r\nThe pupils of the Royal School of Artillery at Segovia obtained from\r\nCount Lacy the amelioration of their severe system of discipline,\r\nan augmentation of the number of their scholars and cadets, and the\r\nincrease of certain branches of knowledge relating to their branch\r\nof the military profession, by the establishment of the schools of\r\nchemistry, of mineralogy, and of pyrotechny, of all of which he urged\r\nthe creation.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed that Count Lacy was more admirable for his lofty\r\nspirit, his sparkling wit, and tall and handsome figure--which\r\napproached the gigantic--than for his talents as a soldier; but his\r\namiable and conciliatory character have never been denied, while his\r\nbenevolence, his Christian virtues, and patriotism were extolled even\r\nby his enemies; for he stood too high in the favour of the Spanish King\r\nto have friends _alone_. Such was Francis Anthony Lacy.\r\n\r\nHe died at Barcelona, in the time of Charles IV., on the 31st December,\r\n1792, in the sixty-first year of his age.\r\n\r\nOn that occasion the most universal regrets were manifested at his\r\nfuneral, which was conducted with great splendour and solemnity;\r\nand the officers and cadets of the Spanish artillery, by whom he\r\nwas sincerely beloved, celebrated him in high eulogies, which were\r\npublished in all the journals of Madrid and Catalonia.\r\n\r\nDon Antonio Ricardo Carillo, of Albornoz, succeeded him as\r\nCaptain-general of Catalonia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRICK LACY, the brother of Count Anthony Francis, was major of the\r\nUlster Regiment of Irish Infantry in the service of Spain, and died\r\nearly in life, leaving a son named Louis, who was justly celebrated\r\nfor his bravery, his misfortunes, and romantic history.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUIS LACY was born on the 11th January, 1775, at San Roque, a judicial\r\npartido and town of Andalusia, six miles distant from Gibraltar, after\r\nthe capture of which it was founded, in 1704. His father, Major Lacy,\r\ndying while he was yet an infant, his mother married an officer of the\r\nBrussels Regiment of infantry in the service of Charles III. Young\r\nLouis, at the early age of nine years, entered this corps as a cadet,\r\nwith his stepfather, and accompanied it to Puerto Rico, one of the\r\nSpanish West India islands, which was used then as a penal colony;\r\nit had been so for two centuries before. Thus a strong garrison was\r\nmaintained at the capital, San Juan de Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, Lacy showed so decided a vocation for the life of\r\na soldier, that on his return to Spain, in 1789, Charles IV. removed\r\nhim into the Ulster Regiment, among the gallant Irishmen of which his\r\nfamily name was held in high veneration; and in that battalion of\r\nexiles he obtained a company in 1794.\r\n\r\nIn that year, when the French Republican forces invaded Spain, and\r\ncommenced those operations which ended in the capture of Fontarabia and\r\nSan Sebastian, Lacy was, with the regiment of Ulster, attached to the\r\narmy of Catalonia, and fighting against them. The French were 40,000\r\nstrong, the Spaniards only 20,000.\r\n\r\nIn Catalonia their progress was small; but in Guipuzcoa many places\r\nof importance fell into their hands; for the Court, languid and slow\r\nin all its warlike operations, opposed to them forces of inferior\r\nstrength, and unhappily more accustomed to defeat than victory.\r\nBellegarde was besieged by the French, who defeated the Spaniards\r\nbefore it; yet its commandant, the Marquis de Vallesantero, held out\r\nbravely. On the shores of the Bay of Biscay the arms of the invaders\r\nwere successful; they made themselves masters of Passages, and the\r\nstrong old castle of San Sebastian; they penetrated as far as Tolosa,\r\nassaulted Placentia, and besieged Pampeluna. Lacy is recorded as\r\nhaving personally and particularly signalized himself in battle against\r\nthe French on the 5th of February, and the 5th, 16th, and 25th days of\r\nJune, 1794; and to these circumstances their own military historians\r\nbear honourable testimony.\r\n\r\nDriven to extremities, Bellegarde surrendered on the 17th of September;\r\nand the brave Conde de la Union, after making a desperate and futile\r\nattempt to save it, fell in battle for his country, on the heights of\r\nFigueras, where 9000 Spaniards and 171 pieces of cannon were taken.\r\nThe fall of Rosas followed, and the Court of Madrid trembled for the\r\nsafety of the Catalonian coast. But the war was ended in the following\r\nyear by the peace of Basle; and up to that period Lacy served, with the\r\nRegiment of Ulster, with honourable distinction, and attained great\r\nexperience in the art of war--that arduous profession to which all the\r\nexiles of his family had so successfully and especially dedicated their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1795, he embarked with his regiment for the Canary\r\nIslands. While there he unfortunately had a love intrigue with a\r\nyoung Spanish lady, of great personal attractions; and in gaining her\r\nfavour, won, also, the enmity of the governor and captain-general of\r\nthe colony, who, by ill-luck, proved to be his rival. Enraged by the\r\nsuccess of the handsome Lacy, the proud and revengeful Spaniard was so\r\nweak and unjust as to exile him from his regiment and the society of\r\nhis companions in arms, by banishing him to Ferro, one of the smallest\r\nand most westerly of the Canary Islands. An arid and barren place, it\r\nis a mere mountain pass, composed of dark grey land, dotted here and\r\nthere by sombre bushes.\r\n\r\nIndignant at such arbitrary treatment, Louis Lacy wrote bitter and\r\nfiery letters to the captain-general, who made him a prisoner, and\r\nbrought him before a _Consijo de Guerra_, or court-martial, by sentence\r\nof which he was condemned to imprisonment as one labouring under mental\r\nalienation, and, after all his gallant services, was deprived of his\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he was permitted to return to Spain, and was sent to Cadiz\r\n_en retrait_.\r\n\r\nAt that time Spain, having made peace with France, was at war with\r\nJohn VI. of Portugal. This contest was productive of no important\r\nevent, and was terminated in 1801. Lacy arrived in Europe just as\r\nthe last campaign was opened against the Portuguese; and hearing\r\nof it, he vainly solicited from the government of Charles IV. the\r\nhonour of being permitted to serve in the Spanish army as a simple\r\ngrenadier; but the mal-influence of his enemy, the Governor of the\r\nCanaries, still followed him, and this humble request was refused\r\nhim. Poor Lacy, in bitterness of spirit and almost without a coin in\r\nhis purse, resolved to push his fortunes elsewhere. He wandered on\r\nfoot through the Peninsula, crossed the Pyrenees, and, like an humble\r\nwayfaring pedestrian, passed through France, and arrived at the town of\r\nBoulogne-sur-mer in October, 1803, when Bonaparte was assembling his\r\ngreat army for the invasion of Britain.\r\n\r\nFinding himself destitute, and without resources, Lacy enlisted in\r\nthe 6th Regiment of light infantry of the French line, as a private\r\nsoldier; but his previous military knowledge, which was soon discovered\r\nby his comrades and officers, obtained for him, in one month, the rank\r\nof sergeant. About the same time General Clarke (who was afterwards,\r\nin 1809, created Duc de Feltre) having heard of him, related the\r\nhistory of Lacy, of his father and uncle, to the Emperor Napoleon.\r\nStruck by a narrative so singular, Napoleon sent for the sergeant, and\r\nbeing charmed by his manner and bearing, in virtue of the rank he had\r\npreviously held, generously gave him the commission of captain in the\r\nIrish Legion, which was then being organized at Morlaix, under Arthur\r\nO'Connor, for the service of France. General Clarke, Minister of War\r\nunder Napoleon, being of Irish descent, had the idea of gaining over\r\nsome of the old Irish aristocracy; and Nadgett, another Irishman in\r\nthe Foreign Office, had a scheme for enlisting Irish prisoners in the\r\nFrench prisons; a scheme which proved, however, unsuccessful. Arthur\r\nO'Connor had been M.P. for Philipstown, but rebelled in 1798, and after\r\nbeing imprisoned at Dublin, and tried for high treason at Maidstone, he\r\nwas acquitted. In France he became a general, married the daughter of\r\nthe Marquis de Condorcet, and died at Bignon in 1852.\r\n\r\nFrom Morlaix Lacy marched with his regiment to Quimper-Corentin, an old\r\nmanufacturing town in the departement of Finisterre; and while there\r\nbecame acquainted with a pretty French girl, Mademoiselle Guermer, to\r\nwhom he became attached, and whom he married, in June, 1806, although\r\nher parents--old royalists probably--were bitterly opposed to her\r\nespousing a soldier of fortune in the Legion of Exiles.\r\n\r\nLacy was then in his thirty-first year.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards the Irish Legion marched for Antwerp, and he took\r\nhis wife with him. From Antwerp the Irish went to the pestilential\r\nIsle of Walcheren; there also his young wife accompanied him, and he\r\nobtained a majority.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, he was appointed _Chef-du-Battailon_ of the Irish attached\r\nto the army which Murat, Grand Duke of Berg, was to command in Spain,\r\nfor the purpose of accomplishing Bonaparte's unjustifiable scheme of\r\nusurpation and conquest.\r\n\r\nLacy's generous mind became deeply agitated at the prospect of being\r\nobliged to serve against that nation among whom his exiled family had\r\nfound a home; and, notwithstanding the bitterness yet rankling in\r\nhis mind against those who had treated him so ill in Spain, and who\r\nhad dismissed him from the Regiment of Ulster, he determined not to\r\ndraw a sword against the country of his father's adoption, and with\r\nsorrow sent his young wife, with their infant son, back to her family\r\nat Quimper, there to await the settlement of the Peninsular affairs.\r\nAs _Chef-du-Battailon_, he still remained with the army which crossed\r\nthe Pyrenees, in virtue of the base conspiracy of the Escurial, and\r\nwhich marched unmolested through the barrier-towns of San Sebastian,\r\nFigueras, Pampeluna, and Barcelona, in the spring of 1808; and in the\r\nsummer of that year he found himself with the French army at Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe events of the 2nd of May--the decoying of the Royal Family to\r\nBayonne by Bonaparte--their compulsory renunciation of the Spanish\r\ncrown--and other dark transactions, decided the noble Lacy on the\r\ncourse he should pursue. He relinquished his command of the Irish,\r\nand quietly quitting the capital, surrendered himself a prisoner of\r\nwar to the venerable Spanish general, Don Gregorio de la Cuesta, who,\r\nin his seventieth year, still held the command of the forces to which\r\nFerdinand VII. had appointed him, as Captain-General of Castile and\r\nLeon.\r\n\r\nStruck with the story and magnanimity of Lacy, and revering his\r\ncharacter, Cuesta, the last of the old Spanish cavaliers, appointed\r\nhim at once Lieutenant-Colonel-Commandant of the Battalion of Ledesma,\r\nwhich had been raised in the small province of that name, near\r\nSalamanca; and he gave all his energy and talent to discipline this\r\nregiment. For now Spain had risen bravely against the invaders, and\r\nthe sturdy Asturians and Galicians, under Don Joachim Blake, a young\r\nofficer of Irish parentage, had commenced the War of Independence. In\r\nall the operations of the Spaniards Lacy fought gallantly, at the head\r\nof his new regiment; but more particularly at Logrono, in Old Castile,\r\nand on the retreat to the Ebro, at Guadalaxara, thirty-two miles from\r\nMadrid; after the betrayal of which, the Spanish vanguard, which,\r\nunder Venegas, had saved the army at Buvierca, by so bravely defending\r\nthe pass, entered the city on the night of the 4th of December, 1809.\r\nThe battalions (_tercios_) \"of Ledesma and Salamanca, under Don Louis\r\nLacy and Don Alexandro de Hore,\" skirmished for three hours with the\r\nFrench that night, on the banks of the Henares; but after a desperate\r\nencounter, the flower of the Spanish troops had to retire before them.\r\n\r\nHe was now appointed Colonel of the Burgos Regiment of Infantry; and\r\nin the same year defended several defiles of the Sierra Morena--that\r\nlong, steep chain of mountains which the novel of Cervantes (more even\r\nthan the valour of his countrymen) has made famous in Europe, and\r\nwhich divides Andalusia from New Castile. At Toralva he surprised\r\nand captured 3000 French cavalry, and afterwards took command of the\r\nSpanish advanced guard, with the rank of Brigadier-General.\r\n\r\nHe distinguished himself again at Cuesta della Reyna, and at the\r\nbeautiful old town of Aranjuez. While Venegas occupied it, he\r\ndespatched Lacy with a division to drive the enemy, 2000 strong, out\r\nof Toledo, which (as he did not wish to destroy the houses from whence\r\nthey fired upon him, as it was a Spanish town) did not succeed. He next\r\noccupied Puente Larga on the Zarama, which was crossed by the foe; and\r\nthe Spanish general, fearing his retreat would be cut off, ordered\r\nLacy to destroy the Queen's Bridge, and rejoin him, which he skilfully\r\nachieved; but not before the enemy's cavalry from Cuesta della Reyna\r\nhad attacked him, and driven his troops to some heights above the\r\nriver, the passage of which he left Don Luis Riguelmo to defend, with\r\nthree battalions and four field-pieces. He was present, also, at the\r\nengagements at Almonacid de Zoreta, on the left bank of the Tagus,\r\nwhere, for nine consecutive hours, he remained under fire at the head\r\nof his brigade, and where 4000 Spaniards fell; and again he met the\r\nFrench at the pass of Despina Perros, and in the unfortunate battle of\r\nOcana, where Venegas, in his chivalric attempt to save his friends,\r\nthe people of La Mancha, rushed, with his cavalry only, on a force\r\nconsisting of 5000 foot and 800 horse, and was defeated with great loss\r\non the 19th November, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe repeated reverses of the Spaniards after the battles of Ocana and\r\nMedellin (which was lost solely by the indecision of Don Francisco\r\nde Eguia), forced Brigadier Lacy to retire into Cadiz, where, as a\r\nreward for his services, he was named successively, Sub-Inspector,\r\nMajor-General, _Mariscial de Campo_, and Commander of the Isle de Leon,\r\nwhich is a triangular tract of ground separated from the mainland by\r\nthe river of San Pedro. The river side was strongly fortified, and\r\nthe channel flanked by batteries; the whole position, as it contained\r\n50,000 inhabitants, was one of great trust and importance. Here he\r\ndirected the increase of the fortifications, and commanded in many of\r\nthose desperate and sanguinary sorties which were made against the\r\nenemy, who boasted that the _Insurrection_ was confined to this small\r\ncorner of conquered Spain. And now ensued the long blockade, which was\r\nnot raised until the British won the battle of Salamanca, in 1812.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of May, 1811, Lacy took an active part in the battle of\r\nChiclana, which was fought on the eastern bank of the channel of San\r\nPedro, and immediately opposite the Isle de Leon. The brave defence at\r\nCadiz greatly encouraged the Spaniards elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn June he was appointed Commandant-General of Catalonia; but,\r\nunfortunately, was unable to prevent the ancient seaport of Tarragona\r\nfrom falling into the hands of the French. Indefatigable and\r\nunwearying, he rallied the remains of the Spanish forces, and, with\r\nthe Guerillas, organized a new army, at the head of which, for a year\r\nand eight months, he maintained a constant, an obstinate, and unequal\r\nstruggle with the troops of Napoleon. His glorious courage and undying\r\nperseverance gained for him, in 1812, the chief command of the army in\r\nGallicia, about 10,000 strong. This force joined Lord Wellington; but,\r\nafter active operations ceased, marched back into the province from\r\nwhich it was named, and went into winter-quarters. On the new campaign\r\nbeing opened, he appeared at the head of the brave _Gallegos_, and\r\ncontinued to display the highest military talent against the enemy,\r\nuntil they were driven over the Pyrenees by the British; after which,\r\nthe battles of Orthes and Toulouse, and the capture of Paris by the\r\nallies, by securing the peace of 1814, restored tranquillity to ravaged\r\nEurope, and Ferdinand VII. to the throne of Spain.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, this event, for which he had struggled so hard, was\r\nunfortunate for Lacy, who, in consequence of his known attachment to\r\nthe constitution of the Cortes, was deprived of all his offices--a base\r\nreturn for his many noble services--and he was coldly permitted to\r\nretire in obscurity, with his family, to Vinaroz, in the province of\r\nValencia, where he spent two years in peace, though brooding over his\r\nwrongs, and planning means of redress.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, fatally for himself, he returned to active life; for, since\r\nthe death of Parlier, and other brave men, who had fallen in attempting\r\nto secure to Spain that independence for which they had struggled\r\nagainst France, the eyes of all the Liberalists were turned on Louis\r\nLacy, and in him their hopes reposed.\r\n\r\nHaving gone to Calvetes, in Catalonia, to drink the mineral waters, it\r\nchanced that he met there an old companion in arms, General Milano,\r\nand his brother, Don Raphael Milano, with two other Spanish gentlemen,\r\nwhose political sentiments coincided with his own; and, after several\r\nsecret meetings, they boldly resolved on re-establishing the Cortes at\r\nthe point of the sword; for Lacy, relying on the sympathy of several\r\nregiments, and the regard they paid to his name and achievements, hoped\r\nto make them revolt in his favour, on the 5th April, 1817, and proclaim\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nDenounced by two traitors, the whole enterprise fell to pieces, and the\r\nfour projectors failed to save themselves.\r\n\r\nAbandoned nearly by all on whom he had relied, the unfortunate Lacy\r\nwas arrested, with a few faithful friends, and conveyed, under care\r\nof a strong guard of soldiers, to a prison at Barcelona, where he was\r\nhastily tried by a subservient military commission, and sentenced _to\r\ndeath_--a doom which he heard with a calmness that staggered even the\r\nstern and partial judge who pronounced it.\r\n\r\nAs a rising of the Catalonians in his favour was feared and expected,\r\nthe officials of the arbitrary Government at Barcelona secretly\r\nembarked him on board of a small vessel, at midnight, on the 20th June;\r\nand, resolving not to be cheated of their victim, sailed for the island\r\nof Majorca; and there he was quite as secretly landed on a solitary\r\npart of the coast, and conducted, on the night of the 4th July, to the\r\nCastle of Belver, which was garrisoned by a regiment of Neapolitan\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock next morning he was suddenly brought out of the\r\nfortress, just as day was breaking, and conducted to the deep fosse\r\nbefore the gates; there he was barbarously shot by a platoon of\r\nItalians, pursuant to the orders of those who had conveyed him from\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\nLouis Lacy had already faced death too often to receive it otherwise\r\nthan with the hereditary courage and coolness which had distinguished\r\nhim through his eventful life, and he fell with his face to his\r\ndestroyers.\r\n\r\nHis body was deposited in the old cathedral church of San Dominic, at\r\nPalma, the capital of the island; but there it was exhumed, in 1820,\r\nand conveyed, with much religious pomp and solemnity, to Barcelona,\r\nand interred near the remains of his uncle, the Captain-General Count\r\nFrancis Anthony; while the newly-established Cortes, vainly to honour\r\nthe memory of one who had died for them, named his son _the first\r\ngrenadier of the Spanish army_.\r\n\r\nThus perished Louis Lacy, in his forty-second year, one who, more even\r\nthan Riego, had secured, by his patriotism, the Revolution of 1820.\r\n\r\n\"_Lacy_,\" says a French writer, \"etait doué d'une forte constitution,\r\net d'une âme ardent, energique et généreuse. Habile général, intrepide\r\ndans les dangers, _il s'était distingué par des faits d'armes, et par\r\nun patriotisme dignes des Grecs et des Romains_!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This is _not_ the same Irish officer of whom a memoir is\r\ngiven elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Edinburgh Courant_, 7th January, 1761.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Count O'Rourke died at Lincoln's Inn, London, in 1785.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL WALTER BUTLER,\r\n\r\nOF THE IRISH MUSKETEERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the army of Ferdinand II., Emperor of Austria (who succeeded his\r\nbrother Matthias in 1619), then commanded by Albrecht, Count of\r\nWallenstein and Duke of Friedland, were two brave Irish soldiers of\r\nfortune--James Butler, who commanded a regiment of Irish dragoons; and\r\nhis younger brother, Walter, who was colonel of a regiment of Irish\r\nmusketeers.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen were nearly related to James, then Earl of Ormond, and\r\nwere driven to seek service in foreign wars by the result of a quarrel\r\nbetween their family and King James VI. of Scotland and I. of England,\r\nwho had unjustly wrested from the Butlers their valuable estates,\r\nand bestowed them upon his Scottish favourite, Sir Richard Preston,\r\nLaird of Craigmillar (near Edinburgh), and Knight of the Bath. This\r\ngentleman, who was afterwards created Lord Dingwall in the peerage\r\nof Scotland, and Earl of Desmond in that of Ireland, 6th June, 1614,\r\nclaimed Ormond in right of his wife, Lady Elizabeth Butler, who was\r\nthe only daughter of Thomas, Earl of Ormond, and widow of Theobald,\r\nViscount of Theophelim. Such was the undue partiality of James for\r\nhis countryman, the Viscount Dingwall, that in 1614, when Sir Walter,\r\neldest son of Sir John Butler, third brother of the old Earl of Ormond,\r\ninherited that title, the Ormond estates (which in ancient times were\r\nan Irish principality on the left bank of the middle Shannon, in the\r\nnorthern part of Munster) were bestowed upon the stranger; and the\r\nking, to enforce his claim, wrote a very peremptory letter to the Irish\r\nPrivy Council. Sir Arthur Chichester, Baron of Belfast, was at that\r\ntime Lord Deputy and Chief Governor of Ireland. Finding the Council\r\naverse to this injustice, James, who was notorious for entertaining\r\nthe most absurd ideas of his prerogative, took the matter into his own\r\nhands, and, charging the Earl of Ormond with \"non-compliance,\" threw\r\nhim into the Fleet prison, where he remained for eight years, enduring\r\ngreat want and misery, while all his old hereditary possessions were\r\nseized and confiscated, by which his family were reduced and ruined.\r\n\r\nPreston, Lord Dingwall, was drowned in June, 1621 when on his way from\r\nDublin to Scotland. He left an only daughter, Lady Elizabeth Preston,\r\nthrough whom his titles and Irish estates went afterwards to the Earls\r\nof Ossory.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in which the family became involved, and the wandering\r\nspirit which possessed the Irish, like the Scots of those days, led the\r\nearl's two cousins, James and Walter, into the Imperial service, where\r\nthey soon obtained the command of regiments, and served under John de\r\nTscerclai, the Count Tilly, and the great Wallenstein, in most of the\r\nbattles of the Thirty Years' War.\r\n\r\nIn 1631, Walter Butler, with his battalion of Irish musketeers,\r\nformed part of the Imperial garrison which defended the town of\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Oder against the victorious army of Gustavus Adolphus.\r\n\r\nFrankfort was even then a large town, and being capital of the middle\r\nmark of Brandenburg, was remarkable for its fairs and university. As it\r\nstood only forty-eight miles from Berlin, the imperial generals were\r\nanxious about its safety. Hannibal Count de Schomberg, the successor\r\nof old Torquato Conti, commanded the garrison, which consisted of ten\r\nthousand horse and foot. The town was surrounded by strong ramparts and\r\ngates, but was divided in two by the Oder.\r\n\r\nAt the head of eighteen thousand men, with two hundred pieces of\r\ncannon, and a pontoon bridge one hundred and eighty feet long, the\r\nwarlike King of Sweden marched along the banks of the river, and\r\nappeared near the town on the 1st day of April. No troops ever\r\npresented a finer aspect than the Swedish, as they marched in several\r\ncolumns to the investment of Frankfort, the attack on which was\r\nplanned by Sir John Hepburn, of Athelstaneford (afterwards a maréchal\r\nde camp in France), who then commanded the green brigade of Scots in\r\nthe service of Gustavus. In the army of the latter were no less than\r\nfifteen thousand Scots at this time.\r\n\r\nThere is an old rhyme, which says--\r\n\r\n \"He who lyes before Frankfort a year and a daye,\r\n Is lord of the empire for ever and aye.\"\r\n\r\nBut, knowing well that the fiery King of Sweden would not remain a week\r\nif he could help it, Count Schomberg, the commander-in-chief; the Count\r\nde Montecuculi, an Italian; Campmaster-General Teiffenbach, and Colonel\r\nHerbertstein, made the most vigorous preparations to defend the place;\r\nand to _Walter Butler_ and his Irish musketeers assigned a post of the\r\ngreatest danger.\r\n\r\n\"Take him in every respect,\" says the historian of Gustavus, \"he\r\nwas one of the bravest officers in the Emperor's service; but as\r\nthe Imperialists envied this gallant foreigner, care was taken to\r\nplace him in _the weakest part_ of the fortification; or, to speak\r\nmore to the purpose, in a part that scarcely deserved to be called\r\na fortification.\" In no way either daunted or disheartened, Butler\r\nresolved to make the best of it, and ordered his Irishmen to dig a\r\ntrench and form a breastwork in rear of it; and thus, after incredible\r\nlabour, they formed a solid rampart in one day; but that evening he\r\nwent to Count Schomberg, and represented \"that the post assigned to\r\nhim was almost incapable of being defended, and that unless a sally\r\nwas made that very night, to prevent the Swedes and Scots from coming\r\nnearer his indifferent parapet, the place would be taken.\"\r\n\r\nBut Schomberg heard him without interest or attention.\r\n\r\n\"Give me but five troops of cuirassiers, Count Hannibal,\" said he, \"and\r\nfive of dragoons, and at the peril of life and reputation, I will\r\nundertake to make the Swedes raise the siege.\"\r\n\r\nEnvious of the honour already won by the stranger, the Imperialist\r\ndeclined alike the offer and advice, though secretly he dispatched, on\r\nthe very service coveted by Walter Butler, a certain German commander,\r\nwhose cuirassiers failed to perform the duty required, for they were\r\ndriven in by the Scottish Highlanders of Gustavus, and their leader was\r\nshot, while Major Sinclair, of Sir John Hepburn's Scots musketeers,\r\nfollowed them almost into the town.\r\n\r\nCovered by the Rhinegrave's cuirassiers, under Colonel Hume, of\r\nCarrolsidebrae, Hepburn's brigade of Scots intrenched themselves\r\nbefore the great gate of the town; the yellow brigade occupied the\r\nCustrin road; and the white brigade of Swedes was spread throughout the\r\nsuburbs. After a smart cannonade, on Palm Sunday, the 3rd of April, the\r\nKing of Sweden ordered a general assault.\r\n\r\n\"The Swedish soldiers wanting ladders for the scaling of the walls,\r\nrunne to certaines Boores' houses hard bye, whence they bring away the\r\nracks in the stables, and those others without, upon which the Boores\r\nused to lay their cowes' meat. With these and some store of hatchets\r\nthey had gotten, to a mightie strong palisadoe of the enemies' neere\r\nthe walls they goe, which they fell to hewing downe. The enemies\r\nlabouring to defend the stocket or palisadoe, to it on both sides they\r\nfall; the bullets darkening the very aire with a showre of lead. The\r\nImperialists being at length, by main force, beaten off, retire through\r\na sally-port into the towne. Being entered within the outer port,\r\nthere stay they and shoote amaine. The King calling Sir John Hebron\r\nand Colonel Lumsden unto him--'_Now, my brave Scotts_' (saies he),\r\n'_remember your countrymen slain at New Brandenburg!_'\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe Scottish infantry advanced with their pikes in the front rank and\r\ntheir musketeers firing over their heads; thus a terrible slaughter\r\nwas soon made of the Imperialists. \"One Scottish man,\" continues the\r\nquaint record of the Swedish war, \"killed eighteen men with his own\r\nhand. Here did Lumsden take eighteen colours; yea, such testimony\r\nshowed he of his valour, that the king after the battle bade him aske\r\nwhat he wolde, and he wolde give it to him.\" This brave officer was\r\nColonel Sir James Lumsden, of Invergellie, in Fifeshire, afterwards\r\nmade Governor of Newcastle by the Scottish Parliament, and a\r\nmajor-general in the army which invaded England in 1640.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gustavus was pressing with his own brigade upon the quarter\r\noccupied by Butler and his Irish musketeers, who defended themselves\r\nwith incredible resolution; so much so, that when one of them was\r\ndragged over the rampart, he was asked by the Swedish king, \"what\r\nsoldiers these were who fought so valiantly?\" \"Colonel Butler's Irish\r\nregiment,\" replied the prisoner. This was at half-past one in the day,\r\nand Gustavus, on hearing it (according to Harte), drew off his brigade,\r\nand in despair of forcing a passage through the Irish, assailed the\r\nstrong Gueben gate, and about four in the afternoon broke into the town\r\nthrough the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe Governor, Schomberg, Campmaster-General Tieffenbach, the Count\r\nde Montecuculi, Colonels Behem and Herbertstein, with most of the\r\nImperialists, fled out of the city with great baseness, leaving the\r\nfaithful Butler to fight single-handed against the tides of Swedes and\r\nScots who surrounded his almost indefensible post. Already three Irish\r\nlieutenant-colonels, O'Neil, Patrick, and Macarthy were slain, with\r\nCaptain-Lieutenants Grace and Brown, and Ensign Butler, all Irish, and\r\nmany of their men. At last Walter Butler was pierced by a bullet, and\r\nhad his sword-arm broken by a musket-ball, and when he fell the remnant\r\nof his gallant soldiers surrendered, and resistance was at an end.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fugitive generals fled towards Silesia, and everywhere\r\ngave out that Butler and the Irish had betrayed Frankfort, by\r\npermitting the enemy to enter by _their_ quarter, as it was the\r\nweakest; and had it not been for a providential accident, adds an\r\nhistorian, Butler might have been beheaded and degraded, in spite\r\nof all his gallant services; but next day, says one of the stormers,\r\nthe Scottish Colonel Munro, in his history, \"It was to be seen where\r\n_the best service was done_; and truly had all the rest (of the\r\nImperialists) stood to it as well as the _Irish did_, we had returned\r\nwith great loss, and without victory.\" He adds, there were taken fifty\r\nstandards, one colonel, five lieutenant-colonels, \"and one Irish\r\ncavalier, Butler, who behaved himself honourably and well.\" Hundreds\r\nof Imperialists were drowned in the Oder, and a vast quantity of\r\nplunder was taken. That night the King of Sweden gave a banquet to his\r\nprincipal officers and colonels, Sir John Hepburn, Munro, Lumsden, Sir\r\nJohn Banier, and others; and when they were assembling, \"Cavaliers,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I will not eat a morsel until I have seen this brave Irishman\r\nof whom we hear so much; and yet,\" he added, to Colonel Hume, \"I have\r\nthat to say to him which he may not be pleased to hear.\"\r\n\r\nButler's wounds rendered him incapable of exertion; but on a litter of\r\npikes being formed, he was conveyed into the presence of Gustavus, who\r\ngazed at him sternly, and asked with anger--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, art thou the elder or the younger Butler?\"\r\n\r\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" replied the wounded man, \"I am but the\r\nyounger.\"\r\n\r\n\"God be praised!\" said Gustavus Adolphus. \"Thou art a brave fellow.\r\nHadst thou been the elder, I meant to have run my sword through thy\r\nbody; but now my own physicians shall attend thee, and nothing shall be\r\nomitted that may procure thee happiness and ease.\"\r\n\r\nThe action by which James Butler had kindled so much indignation in\r\nthe breast of the usually placid Gustavus is now unknown; but it must\r\nhave been something very remarkable to excite such angry bitterness.\r\nHad Walter Butler been a Protestant, the king would, no doubt, have\r\nendeavoured to lure him into the Swedish service; but the wounded\r\nImperialist was as famous for his strict adherence to the duties of the\r\nRoman Catholic church as for his gallantry in the field.\r\n\r\nWhile lying thus helplessly at Frankfort, he was deeply stung and\r\nmortified by the rumour so wickedly and so industriously spread by the\r\nImperial generals, that he had occasioned the loss of the town; and he\r\ncast his honour under the protection of the generous Gustavus.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the latter, \"it is in my power to do your character ample\r\njustice, and in such a manner that it can never be controverted. I will\r\nbear full testimony to your faith and valour under my own hand and\r\nroyal seal.\"\r\n\r\nAssuming a pen, he drew up a certificate, which set forth the heroism\r\ndisplayed by Butler in the strongest terms, and added, \"that if the\r\nImperial generals, instead of acting like poltroons, had performed but\r\na fifth part of what this gallant Irishman had done, he (Gustavus)\r\nshould never have been master of Frankfort, but after an obstinate\r\nsiege alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"This, sir,\" said the king, \"is no more than is due to a brave and\r\ninjured man; so every general in the room will take a pride in signing\r\nthis paper with me.\" This was accordingly done by Sir John Banier, the\r\nScottish colonels, and others.\r\n\r\nJames Butler, who was then at the court of Ferdinand II., at Vienna,\r\nwas stung to the soul by the tidings that his brother had betrayed a\r\npost, and he wrote to Walter a letter full of the bitterest reproaches.\r\n\"You have tarnished the lustre of the Imperial arms, as well as the\r\nname of Butler,\" he wrote; \"and Cæsar's court-martial will make your\r\nname a bye-word of reproach.\"\r\n\r\nWalter Butler was grieved by this insolence and unkindness, and\r\nhastened to show the letter to the King of Sweden.\r\n\r\n\"Heed it not, Colonel Butler,\" said he; \"send our testimonial to the\r\nEmperor, and trouble yourself no more about it.\"\r\n\r\nThirty thousand pounds' worth of plunder, and ten baggage waggons, with\r\nall the plate of the fugitives, were taken, and all their munitions of\r\nwar; however, they had buried in the earth a great quantity of arms. In\r\n1850, a labourer, when digging a trench in a field near the outworks of\r\nold Frankfort, came upon a depôt of old weapons, decaying, and covered\r\nwith rust. Among them were 2000 matchlocks, being part of the munition\r\nconcealed by the garrison of Count Schomberg. As soon as his wounds\r\npermitted him to travel, Walter Butler left Frankfort, for Gustavus\r\nwas too generous to detain as a prisoner one whose gallant spirit was\r\nwrithing under unmerited reproaches. He travelled towards Silesia, and\r\nsought out a Colonel Behem, who had commanded a regiment of German\r\ninfantry at the defence of Frankfort, and to whom he was fortunate\r\nenough in tracing the first of the slanderous reports, and challenged\r\nhim to single combat on horse or foot, with sword and pistol; but, awed\r\nby the justice of Butler's cause, his known skill and courage, and\r\nby the formidable testimonial of Gustavus Adolphus, he signed a full\r\nretractation and apology.\r\n\r\nButler then went into Poland, and at his own expense raised a fine\r\nregiment of cavalry, all clad in buff coats, with back and breast\r\npieces, and triple-barred helmets. While recruiting there he daily ran\r\nthe risk of being murdered by the Polish peasantry, who were averse\r\nto the Imperial service; but he marched as soon as his new levy was\r\ncompleted, and on his return to the Emperor's army took possession\r\nof Prague, the capital of Bohemia. This made him more than ever a\r\nfavourite of the great Wallenstein.\r\n\r\nSoon after this exploit he married the Countess of Fondowna.\r\n\r\nHe was at Prague when the ambitious Wallenstein became false to the\r\ninterests of the Empire, and fell into the deadly snare prepared for\r\nhim at Egra by Colonel James Butler and others, on whose unscrupulous\r\nfidelity the Imperial court could rely. Had Walter not been a rigidly\r\nhonourable man, he might have realized a large fortune by the death of\r\nhis leader, who, being always fond of foreign troops, wished him to\r\nreturn to Ireland for the purpose of raising a body of infantry to cope\r\nwith the Scottish brigades of Gustavus. For this purpose he offered\r\nhim money to the amount of 32,000_l._ sterling by bills of exchange\r\nat Hamburg, and ready cash, which was lying useless at his palace of\r\nSagan, on the bank of the Bober, in Prussian Silesia. But he declined\r\nthe service with these remarkable words--\"Poor old Ireland has been\r\ndrained too much of her men already.\" This anecdote, says Walter Harte\r\nin his history, I learned at Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe wild schemes and daring ambition of Wallenstein now made him\r\nindulge in the hope of dismembering the great conquests of the Empire,\r\nand seating himself upon a new throne, to be erected by the sword in\r\nnorthern Europe. This hope was crushed in 1634, when the great duke\r\nwas spending the holidays of Christmas in the old castle of Egra in\r\nBohemia. The garrison in this fortress was commanded by John Gordon, a\r\nPresbyterian, a native of Aberdeenshire, who was colonel of Tzertzski's\r\nregiment, and had once been a private soldier. Wallenstein's personal\r\nescort consisted of 250 men of James Butler's Irish regiment, commanded\r\nby that officer in person.\r\n\r\nJames Butler (without communicating the matter to his brother Walter),\r\nJohn Gordon, and Major Walter Lesley, son of the Laird of Balquhan in\r\nthe Garioch, on receiving private instructions from Vienna, resolved,\r\nwithout scruple or remorse, on removing the ambitious general from the\r\npath of the emperor for ever. Butler prepared a grand banquet, to which\r\nhe invited the generalissimo's attendants. Previous to the latter,\r\nButler, who, felt some distrust of Lesley and Gordon, who were both\r\nScots and Presbyterians, while he was a Catholic, made some remarks\r\nexpressive of admiration for the duke.\r\n\r\n\"You may do as you please, gentlemen, in the matter at issue,\" said\r\nGordon; \"but death itself shall never alienate me from the duty and\r\naffection I bear his majesty the emperor.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Butler produced a letter from Mathias Count Galas\r\n(who, after the siege of Mantua, obtained the supreme command of the\r\nImperial army), wherein Ferdinand II. authorized them and all his\r\nofficers to withdraw \"their allegiance\" from Wallenstein, for all the\r\ntroops had taken an oath of obedience to _him_ by the emperor's express\r\norder. Fully empowered by this document to do what they pleased, the\r\nthree mercenaries resolved on his immediate destruction. One proposed\r\nto poison him; another suggested that he should be sent a prisoner\r\nto Vienna; a third, that he should be slain after _disposing_ of his\r\nfriends at the _banquet_. The last was at once adopted, and several\r\nwere invited, among whom were Wallenstein's brother-in-law, Colonel\r\nTzertzski; Colonels Illo, William Kinski, and the secretary, Colonel\r\nNiemann. The castle was filled with soldiers on whom Gordon and Butler\r\ncould rely. As the fatal evening drew on, Captain Walter Devereaux,\r\nWatchmaster Robert Geraldine, and fifteen other Irishmen, entered the\r\nkeep, and took possession of a postern; while to Captain Edmund Bourke,\r\nwith one hundred more, was assigned the duty of keeping the streets\r\nquiet; for Tzertzski's dragoons occupied the town, which is the capital\r\nof its circle, and was then surrounded by a triple rampart, washed on\r\none side by the Egra.\r\n\r\nThe banquet was protracted so long that at half-past ten the dessert\r\nwas still on the table, when Colonel Gordon filled up a goblet of wine,\r\nand proposed the health of the shy and cunning John George, Elector of\r\nSaxony, the enemy of the emperor.\r\n\r\nButler affected astonishment, and said \"he would drink to no man's\r\nprosperity who was the enemy of _Cæsar_.\"\r\n\r\nPretended high words ensued, and while the unsuspecting friends of\r\nWallenstein gazed about them in wonder and perplexity, the doors were\r\nflung open, and Geraldine and Devereaux, with their soldiers armed with\r\ndrawn swords or partizans, rushed in.\r\n\r\n\"Long live Ferdinand the Second!\" cried Devereaux.\r\n\r\n\"God prosper the house of Austria,\" added Geraldine; while Butler,\r\nGordon, and Lesley, snatched up the candles, held them aloft, and drew\r\ntheir swords. Wallenstein's friends saw that they were betrayed; they\r\nsprang to their weapons, all flushed with wine and with fury at this\r\ntreachery; the tables were dashed over, and a deadly combat began.\r\nColonel Illo was rushing to his sword, which was hanging on the wall,\r\nwhen an Irishman ran him through the heart. Tzertzski placed himself in\r\na corner, and slew three; for the assailants, believing him to be proof\r\nto mortal weapons, were afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\"Leave me, leave me for a moment,\" he continued to cry, while fighting\r\nwith all the energy of despair; \"leave me to deal with Lesley and\r\nGordon--I will fight them both hand to hand--after that you may kill\r\nme; but, O, Gordon, what a supper is this for your friends.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant he pierced the young Duke de Lerida by a mortal wound,\r\nbut was almost immediately overpowered by ten strokes, and, with Kinski\r\nand Tzertzski, nearly hewn to pieces. Unglutted yet with blood, Captain\r\nDevereaux, finding his rapier broken, snatched up a partizan, and,\r\nfollowed by thirty soldiers, rushed to the apartments of Wallenstein;\r\nwho, having heard the uproar in the hall, had double-bolted his door\r\nwithin; and they assailed it with noise and great fury, while Butler\r\nstood, with his sword drawn, on the staircase below. Even the bold\r\nheart of Wallenstein was appalled by the unusual uproar--he leaped from\r\nhis bed, and threw on a dressing-gown. He raised the window of the\r\nroom; but the wall of the tower was too high for escape, and he cried\r\naloud--\r\n\r\n\"Will none here assist me? Alas! is no one here my friend?\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Devereaux knocked again, and commanded his soldiers to burst\r\nopen the door. Five times their united strength failed before it, till\r\nhe applied his own shoulder to it; and, being a man of great power, he\r\nbroke it to fragments, and then they beheld before them the formidable\r\nWallenstein, Duke of Friedland and Prince of the Vandal Isles, standing\r\nnear a table, in his shirt, pale and composed, but defenceless--for\r\nhe had neither sword nor pistols; for Schiller asserts that he was\r\ndisturbed in the study of astrology.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou not the betrayer of Ferdinand and the Empire?\" cried Captain\r\nDevereaux, as he charged his partizan; \"if so, now thou must die.\"\r\n\r\nWallenstein made no reply, but opened his arms, as if still more to\r\nexpose his naked breast, into which the Irish captain thrust his\r\nweapon, and he expired without a groan, while all the soldiers shrunk\r\nback, as if appalled by the act; yet his naked body, and the bodies of\r\nthe Colonels Niemann, Tzertzski, Illo, and Kinski were carried in a\r\ncart through the streets of Egra, and tossed into a ditch. So perished\r\nthe magnificent Wallenstein, the dictator of Germany!\r\n\r\nJames Butler and Devereaux hastened to Vienna, where the Emperor\r\nFerdinand II. fastened round the neck of the former a valuable chain,\r\ngiving, at the same time, his Imperial benison and a gold medal,\r\nsaying, \"Wear this, Colonel Butler, in memory of an emperor you have\r\nsaved from ruin.\" He then created him a Count of the Holy Roman Empire,\r\nand gave him the gold key of the bedchamber, with extensive estates\r\nin the kingdom of Bohemia; and, to crown all, by an act of abominable\r\nhypocrisy, he ordered three thousand masses to be said for repose of\r\nthe murdered general's soul. Devereaux also received a gold chain with\r\nthe gold key and a colonelcy; but he left the Imperial service, and\r\nreturned home to Ireland in 1638.\r\n\r\nColonel Gordon was created a marquis of the Empire, Colonel-General\r\nof the Imperial army, and High Chamberlain of Austria. Major Walter\r\nLesley, who was then a captain of the Body Guard, was created Count\r\nLesley, and Lord of Newstadt, an estate worth two hundred thousand\r\nflorins. He died Field-Marshal, Governor of Sclavonia, and Knight of\r\nthe Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nJames Butler enjoyed his countship only one year; for he died at\r\nWirtemberg in the early part of the year 1634, leaving a very ample\r\nfortune, and money to found a college of Irish Franciscans, which\r\nstill exists in the Bohemian capital. To Laurmayne, confessor to the\r\nemperor, he left a memorial worth twenty pounds by his will. To the\r\nScottish and Irish colleges at Prague he bequeathed 3300_l._; to the\r\nIrish students at Prague, 500_l._ among them equally; to his sister,\r\n1000_l._; to Walter Devereaux whose partizan slew Wallenstein, 150_l._\r\nHis widow, whom he left in easy circumstances, conveyed his body into\r\nBohemia, escorted by a troop of lancers and cuirassiers, and there she\r\ninterred him near his own estates, with great pomp and splendour. In\r\n1638, Thomas Carve, an Irish priest, chaplain of Butler's regiment, and\r\nauthor of a minute account of these affairs,[15] obtained a commission\r\nas chaplain-general \"to all the Scottish and Irish forces in the\r\nImperial service.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the development and _denouement_ of this daring conspiracy\r\nagainst the great Imperialist, his friend, Walter Butler, was in\r\ncommand at Prague, about seventy miles distant from the castle of\r\nEgra; and he was filled with horror and dismay at the part played\r\nby his brother in the dark and terrible tragedy. It was, moreover,\r\nan unfortunate event for _him_, as he never obtained any place at\r\ncourt, any military order, or rose one rank higher in the army from\r\nthenceforward--for, as a favourite of Wallenstein, he was an object of\r\ndistrust to the emperor.\r\n\r\nIn the same year his brother died. Walter served with distinguished\r\nbravery at Nordlingen in Swabia, where, on the 26th of August, 1634,\r\na general engagement was the result of Field-Marshal Gustaf Horne's\r\nattempt to relieve the town, then besieged by the Imperialists, who\r\nobtained a complete victory; for the Swedish army was defeated with\r\ngreat loss, and had 4000 baggage-waggons, 80 pieces of cannon, and 300\r\nstand of colours taken. The Scottish brigades suffered severely. In\r\nparticular the Highland regiment of Colonel Robert Munro, which by the\r\nslaughter of that fatal day was reduced to _one_ company.\r\n\r\nBy his valour and example Walter Butler, at the head of his\r\nregiment, \"decided the victory in favour of the Imperialists.\" To\r\nquote Harte--\"He stood firm, without losing one inch of ground, for\r\nthree-and-twenty hours, during a continual fire, and though 16,000\r\nsoldiers were killed in that engagement.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this great battle he died of a severe illness. The\r\ndescendants of his brother distinguished themselves repeatedly in the\r\nfuture wars of the grasping House of Austria, particularly in those\r\nwaged against Frederick the Great, King of Prussia; and there is now\r\nliving in Bohemia an old nobleman named Baron Bütler, who boasts of\r\nbeing the fourth in descent from James Butler of Ormond, one of the\r\nslayers of the great Duke of Friedland.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Swedish Intelligencer, 1632._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Thomas Carve (Tipperariensis), _Itinerarium_, 12mo.\r\n1639-1641.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHAL CLARKE,\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR OF VIENNA AND BERLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry James William Clarke, Duc de Feltre, Minister of War under the\r\nEmperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and afterwards under the Bourbons, was born\r\non the 17th October, 1765, at Landrecies, a town of France, situate\r\non the Sambre, westward of Maubeuge, and about one hundred miles from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nHis father belonged to one of the many exiled Irish families who\r\nfollowed to France the abdicated James VII. of Scotland, and II. of\r\nEngland; and after serving King Louis as a subaltern officer, died at\r\nan early age on obtaining the rank of colonel, leaving his son, the\r\nfuture general, an orphan, to the care of his uncle, Colonel Shee, who\r\nwas then \"Sécretaire des Commandement du Duc d'Orléans,\" and afterwards\r\nPrefect of Strasbourg, and a peer of France. It is strange how well\r\nfortune favoured all these Irish exiles in the various lands of their\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nBy Colonel Shee, Henry Clarke was well and carefully reared, as he\r\nintended him for the service of Louis XVI. Thus, on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, 1781, he entered the Military School at Paris as a cadet;\r\nand after going through a brief curriculum, left it on the 11th of\r\nNovember, 1782, to join the regiment of the Duc de Berwick as a\r\nsub-lieutenant. Wishing to join the cavalry, on the 5th of September,\r\n1784, he was appointed cornet of hussars, with the rank of captain in\r\nthe regiment of the colonel-general of this branch of the service.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July, 1790, he obtained a captaincy of dragoons, and in\r\nthe same year received leave of absence to visit Great Britain, as a\r\ngentleman in the suite of the ambassador.\r\n\r\nIt was to the friendship and patronage of the Duke of Orleans that\r\nClarke owed these favours, and generally, his rapid advancement in\r\nthe army; and it was to this prince that the hussar regiment of the\r\ncolonel-general belonged, according to a custom of the old _régime_.\r\n\r\nOn his return to France, Clarke applied immediately for active service,\r\nand on the 5th of February, 1792, was appointed a captain of the first\r\nclass, and soon after he attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel of\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nHe remained in command of his regiment during all the horrors of\r\nthe Revolution; and, at its head, served in the two campaigns which\r\nfollowed the attack on the Tuileries, the deposition of the king,\r\nand the murders of 1792. In September he assisted very materially at\r\nthe capture of Spire, the _ci-devant_ capital of a bishopric in the\r\npalatinate of the Rhine, along the upper circle of which Custine had\r\nspread his brilliant conquests.\r\n\r\nThe French attacked the Austrians, who were in order of battle in front\r\nof the city. They were outflanked, and driven back; the gates were cut\r\ndown by axes, or blown to pieces by cannon, and the republicans stormed\r\nthe place, taking 3000 prisoners, with a vast train of cannon and\r\nmortars. Clarke bore a conspicuous part as an active cavalry officer in\r\nall the subsequent operations of the French army, including the capture\r\nof Worms, with all its stores, and of Mentz, before which the army\r\narrived on the 19th of October, after forced marches, performed amid\r\ntorrents of rain; and the taking of Frankfort, which was ransomed from\r\ndestruction and pillage on the payment of 500,000 florins.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March, after the rout of Bingen, he defended the passage\r\nof the Nahe, a German stream, which falls into the Rhine near the\r\nformer place, and there he was of signal service to the retreating\r\ntroops. He was present at the affair of Horcheim, which was afterwards\r\nannexed to France, and the capture of Landau, on the 17th of May. His\r\ndistinguished bravery on these occasions obtained him the rank of\r\nGeneral of Brigade, provisionally, the commission of which he received\r\non the field of battle. He then received the command of three regiments\r\nof dragoons, which formed the advanced guard of the army of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards we find him exercising in this army the functions of\r\n_Chef d'Etat-Major Général_; but on the 12th of October, 1793, the\r\nCommissioners of the National Convention, in virtue of a most unjust\r\ndecree of that tyrannical assembly, deprived him of his rank, as he\r\nhappened to be at that time on their secret list of the _suspected_.\r\n\r\nHe received intelligence of this on the very evening before the\r\nAustrians stormed the French lines at Weissembourg, on the Lower Rhine,\r\nand he retired at once to Alsace, where he was confined on a species of\r\nparole; nor did he recover his military rank and position until after\r\nthe downfall and death of the cruel and infamous Robespierre.\r\n\r\nUnder the protection of M. Carnot, who was then Minister of Public\r\nSafety, Clarke was placed at the head of a committee of military\r\ntopography; and in this service he exhibited the greatest talent as\r\na director and instructor, and spared no pains to fulfil the duties\r\nimposed upon him. The restless and suspicious Directory, in thus\r\nmaintaining M. Carnot at the head of their affairs as minister, caused\r\nalso the retention of Clarke, whose importance seemed to increase with\r\nthat of his patron.\r\n\r\nHe was confirmed a General of Brigade in March, 1795; and on his\r\nappointment to the rank of General of Division, on the 17th of\r\nSeptember, in the same year, our Irish exile could scarcely believe\r\nthat fate had higher or more brilliant destinies in store for him; but\r\nnow his talents as a diplomatist were about to be put in requisition.\r\nThis was when the astonishing successes of Napoleon in Italy had\r\nalarmed the Directory, who dispatched Clarke to Vienna, entrusting\r\nto him the difficult mission of preparing the terms of the projected\r\npeace between Republican France and the Imperial Court; but, as he was\r\nadverse to the wishes of the Directory, and inimical to the task, his\r\narrangements proved unfortunately disadvantageous to the French.\r\n\r\nAfter this he visited the army of Italy, the General-in-Chief of\r\nwhich, being influenced by the Directory, placed him in a subordinate\r\nposition, alike repugnant to his love of freedom and authority. As\r\nsimple plenipotentiary, Clarke, after traversing Germany, showed\r\nhimself at Vienna to be the political confidant of the powerful\r\nDirectory, and, above all, of M. Carnot.\r\n\r\nIn the minute instructions given to General Clarke by the French\r\nGovernment we are enabled to trace him in his route, which lay through\r\nPiedmont, Milan, Medina, Bologna, and Venice; and by the Directory\r\nhe--more than all their other diplomatic agents--was specially\r\nrecommended to observe narrowly the secret purposes of the different\r\ngreat personages who held important positions at the court of Vienna.\r\n\r\n\"Your journey, M. Clarke,\" said the minister De la Croix, in a letter\r\nwritten on the 17th November, 1796, \"will be sufficiently useful when\r\nyou have no longer anything to know or to discover for the profit\r\nof the Republic or the cause of humanity.\" But it was generally\r\nbelieved--nay, it was openly asserted in Paris--that the mission of\r\nClarke to Vienna was all a _ruse_, and was meant merely to conceal some\r\nartful plot woven by the Directory against Napoleon Bonaparte, before\r\nwhose power and popularity they were beginning to tremble.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Directory really wished a peace, and provisionally\r\ndemanded an armistice; but Bonaparte, who had no desire to see a\r\ngeneral peace in Europe, and, least of all, one formed by any person\r\nsave himself, by his formidable interference and potent influence,\r\ncaused the negotiations entirely to fail. We are enabled to perceive\r\nhow the Directory, in their overtures for peace, above everything else\r\ncounted on those territories which they could offer in exchange for\r\nLuxembourg and other provinces which they had annexed to France. This\r\nsystem of compensation admitted of alterations, which their envoy could\r\nvary at his pleasure, on perceiving the effect produced by each offer\r\non the various members of the Austrian cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn the armistice extended to the two armies they wished the terms\r\nto be similar to those given by their general, Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nwhen besieging Mantua, viz.:--That they should be supplied daily with\r\nammunition and provisions, according to their numerical strength. But\r\nBonaparte declared these terms absurd; and explained to them that\r\nthe suspension of arms alone gave to France the prospect of greater\r\nadvantages than could accrue from terms based on those framed at\r\nMantua. But the commands of the Directory were imperative; and the\r\ncabinet of Vienna, on receiving their overtures, had already sent the\r\nBaron Vincent to Vicenza, to confer with General Clarke, who repelled\r\nwith all his energy the advice and interference of Bonaparte; but the\r\nlatter, on being supported by Barras against him, as one trusted by\r\nCarnot, said plainly to Clarke, \"Si vous êtes venu ici pour faire ma\r\nvolonté, je vous verrai avec plaisir; si c'est le contraire vous pouvez\r\nretourner d'où vous êtes venu.\"\r\n\r\nBy this language he made Clarke feel that his patron, Carnot, was\r\nnot secure in office, and that he must prepare other supporters for\r\nhimself. Indeed, some rumour of this nature had reached him before.\r\nThe result of these disagreements between Clarke and Napoleon caused\r\nthe former to omit all praise of the latter in public communications\r\nto the government at Paris; but, in the first report of Clarke to the\r\nminister De la Croix, dated 7th December, 1796, we find him exculpating\r\nBonaparte of all blame for the awful ravages and atrocities committed\r\nby his troops in Italy.\r\n\r\nBonaparte succeeded in postponing the conferences at Vicenza until the\r\n3rd January, 1797; and so many despatches passed to and fro between the\r\nDirectory, Carnot, and Clarke, that the Baron Vincent lost patience,\r\nand declared, that if France had any further communications to make,\r\nthey must in future be addressed, not to him, but to Gherardini, the\r\nAustrian minister at Turin. Bonaparte took care that this resolution\r\nof the baron should be effectual. Clarke was several times at Turin\r\nand Lombardy, negotiating; and after happily completing a friendly\r\narrangement with his general, was left without other duties to fulfil,\r\nthan to complete, with the Piedmontese court, those amicable treaties\r\nwhich were terminated by an alliance with France on the 5th April, 1797.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he brought before the Directory a series of complaints\r\nagainst certain generals and commissaries of the French army in Italy.\r\nWith the substance of the charges against these officers he had been\r\nfurnished by Bonaparte; and the result was, that many of them were\r\ndisplaced and recalled to France.\r\n\r\nThe complaints or charges furnished to Clarke were sometimes far from\r\ncorrect; but Bonaparte, by means of the envoy, wished to rid his army\r\nof those devastators and peculators, without drawing upon himself\r\ntheir lasting and personal hostility. To the honour of Clarke, it\r\nmust be confessed that his dislike for those who had been guilty of\r\nmal-demeanour in Italy was at least sincere; and in this he proved\r\nhimself worthy to be the friend of Carnot.\r\n\r\nHe found himself again at Turin during the discussion which ensued\r\nconcerning the preliminaries of Leoben. Bonaparte, who had neither\r\ndesire nor authority to conclude anything that resembled a peace,\r\naffected to wish much for the presence of Clarke as a plenipotentiary,\r\nwhile he secretly contrived such means to delay his journey, that it\r\nwas impossible he could arrive in time. Thus ten days passed, and on\r\nthe 17th of April Clarke had not appeared, so Bonaparte signed the\r\narticles _alone_; and on the 6th of the following month, the Directory\r\ninvested them both with full power to sign the final treaty.\r\n\r\nTwo negotiators, the Marquis di Gallo and Meerfeldt, had been\r\nappointed by Austria to meet them; but at the very commencement of\r\ntheir proceedings the proud and haughty spirits of Bonaparte and Gallo\r\ndomineered over their colleagues so completely, that they became as\r\nmere machines in their hands. Clarke had, nevertheless, occasionally\r\nsole charge of the negotiations at Udina, a town in Friuli, where they\r\nhad many meetings concerning the entangled affairs of France and\r\nAustria; but this was only when the tergiversations of the latter, who\r\nwished to recommence the war, were embarrassing the conferences, which,\r\naccording to the caustic expression of Bonaparte, \"were nothing more\r\nthan a series of pleasantries.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these incertitudes and delays, a new revolution took\r\nplace at Paris, on the 4th September, 1797, when the legislative\r\nwas entirely absorbed by the executive power, and when the famous\r\npamphlet of Bailleul, which provoked such a violent debate in the\r\nCouncil of Five Hundred, was the tocsin of alarm. On this day--the 18th\r\n_Fructidor_--Clarke was declared a \"creature of Carnot;\" and, as such,\r\nwas deprived of all power. Thus Bonaparte was left sole plenipotentiary\r\nof the Republic, and had the honour of signing alone the famous treaty\r\nof Campo Formio, which secured a peace between France and the Emperor\r\nFrancis II., and which took its name from the place of meeting--a\r\ncastle of maritime Austria, situated on a hill in the province of\r\nFriuli. It was signed on the 17th October, and was undoubtedly more\r\nglorious for France than the treaty which General Clarke had prepared\r\nfor the same purpose in November, 1796. But Bonaparte behaved with\r\ngreat generosity towards his fallen colleague: he defended him against\r\nthe virulence of the Parisian pamphleteers and journalists, protected\r\nhim while in Italy, and employed him about his staff and person in many\r\nways. \"Could he do less to the star which he had so completely made his\r\nsatellite?\" exclaims a French writer.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant reception which awaited Bonaparte on his triumphant\r\nreturn to France, and still more, the high enthusiasm kindled by his\r\ndeparture for Egypt, threw Clarke completely into the shade; and he was\r\nalmost forgotten by the volatile Parisians during two years that he\r\nlived in retirement.\r\n\r\nM. Xavier Audoin, son-in-law of Pache, succeeded Clarke as chief of\r\nthe Bureau Topographique et Militaire at the Directory. The Parisian\r\njournals accused the general of having enjoyed the confidence of Carnot\r\ntoo much, and to be too deeply attached to the House of Orleans, to\r\nwhich he and his family were indebted for much of their good fortune in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe _Dublin Journal_ of the 7th October, 1797, contains a paragraph to\r\nthe effect that it was known that Clarke had been \"for forty hours,\r\nduring the last week,\" in that city, \"that he had held conferences with\r\nthe leaders of the United Irishmen, and having obtained his information\r\nand given his directions, had embarked in a fishing smack from\r\nKillinbay, on Sunday morning last. That he could have no other purpose\r\nthan the arrangement of a French invasion we have no doubt,\" adds the\r\neditor, \"and when our readers have learned that there is strong ground\r\nto believe that he has been for some time past in the north of Ireland,\r\nthey will naturally join in our opinion. Our readers will recollect\r\nthat this General Clarke was announced in the French papers to have\r\nleft the Italian army some time since on his way to Vienna to negotiate\r\nwith the emperor--there has been _no_ negotiation at Vienna--the treaty\r\nis under discussion at Udina--so that this journey has obviously been\r\nfabricated to _conceal_ his real destination.\"\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all these details, there is no solid proof for\r\nbelieving that General Clarke ever visited the land of his forefathers\r\non this secret duty.\r\n\r\nHe ought, perhaps, to have followed Napoleon, even as a volunteer, to\r\nthe banks of the Nile; but being of a proud and jealous spirit, he was\r\nunfortunately without this feeling of devotion to his new protector.\r\nBonaparte appeared to feel this; for on his return from his distant and\r\ndangerous expedition, and finding himself master of the government, by\r\nthe 18th _Brumaire_ (9th November, 1799), he seemed to look coldly on\r\nthe general at times.\r\n\r\nClarke now neglected nothing that might serve to reinstate him in the\r\ngood graces of the First Consul, who, in September, 1800, intrusted\r\nhim finally with the charge of the negotiations at Luneville, and soon\r\nafter with the military command of that large city, which lies in the\r\ndepartement of the Meurthe. But Clarke felt that these two posts were\r\nalike insignificant and unworthy one of his talent and enterprise; for\r\nthe recent victories in Germany and Italy had greatly simplified his\r\nduties as a negotiator, and the little that remained Bonaparte directed\r\nin Paris. When the arrangements were completed, to the infinite\r\nannoyance of Clarke, he sent his brother Joseph to sign them.\r\n\r\nClarke had meanwhile been preparing for the departure of a body of\r\nRussian officers who were prisoners of war at Lisle; and the kindness\r\nwith which he did so, caused the Emperor Paul I. to present him with a\r\nmagnificent sword, and other marks of his approbation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the weakness of the human heart, that these honours inflated\r\nClarke so much, that for a time he appeared to feel himself equal to\r\nthe First Consul, and indeed he was rash enough, and unwise enough, to\r\nsay so.\r\n\r\nComing early one evening to the opera, he entered the box usually\r\nappropriated to Napoleon, and assumed that august person's place in the\r\nfront seat. When the First Consul came, Clarke had the bad taste to sit\r\nstill during the performance, and leave to his master the second place!\r\n\r\nThese mistakes of temper, united to his punctilious spirit, in affairs\r\nof state, and love of diplomatic work, caused the French government to\r\ngive him the office of minister of France at Florence, that he might\r\nbe away from Paris and near the young Duke of Parma, who wished to\r\nbe named King of all Italy; but this post, say the _Memoirs of St.\r\nHelena_, proved exceedingly distasteful to him.\r\n\r\nClarke's talent--a most useful, if not brilliant one--consisted in\r\nan amazing facility for keeping on the best possible terms with all\r\nthe parties among whom he was cast. The secret of his influence with\r\nBonaparte appears to have been, a sentiment of profound gratitude\r\nin the latter for the high praise bestowed by Clarke in his \"Secret\r\nReport\" to the Directory on the conduct of the young general in Italy.\r\nThis document afterwards fell into the hands of the First Consul, who\r\nnever forgot its contents.\r\n\r\nClarke, tired of his residence in Florence, wrote letter after letter,\r\ndemanding his recal to Paris, terming his embassy a species of exile;\r\nand Bonaparte, believing that his punishment was sufficiently severe,\r\nat last gave him leave to return; but desired him to travel by the way\r\nof Lisle (a fortified city in the departement of the north), to the\r\ncamp at Boulogne. In Belgium he gave him the title of Councillor of\r\nState, and created for him two places in the cabinet--one as secretary\r\nfor the marine, and the other for the war.\r\n\r\nArrived at the camp of Boulogne, one of the earliest matters entrusted\r\nto the general was the proposed establishment of Irish brigades, to\r\nco-operate in the projected invasion of Britain; and these corps Clarke\r\nbelieved might be recruited among the Irishmen who were prisoners of\r\nwar in France. While this project was on the _tapis_, he had many\r\ninterviews with the famous Theobald Wolfe Tone, who had been appointed\r\nby the Directory chef-de-brigade, and afterwards adjutant-general;\r\nand with Lazarus Hoche, a frank, resolute, and zealous republican,\r\nwho, from being a stable-boy and private of the French guards, raised\r\nhimself to one of the highest positions in the army of France. In 1792,\r\nhe was a corporal; in 1793, he was a _general_, commanding the army of\r\nthe Moselle; and in the two subsequent years he subdued La Vendée.\r\n\r\nTone was introduced to Hoche by Clarke, and in his _Memoirs_ he details\r\nthe questions they asked him concerning the state of Ireland; where\r\na landing might be effected; where provisions might be relied on,\r\nparticularly bread; whether French auxiliaries might count on being\r\nable to form an Irish Provisional Government, either of the Catholic\r\nCommittee, or of the chiefs of the Irish patriots? On these subjects\r\nTone had many a long and anxious conference with his countryman Clarke,\r\nand with Hoche.\r\n\r\nAfter a long interview with Hoche, in the cabinet of Fleury one day,\r\nWolfe Tone was asked, what form of government the Irish would adopt, in\r\nthe event of their successfully encountering the British troops?\r\n\r\n\"I was going to answer him with great earnestness,\" says Tone, in his\r\ninteresting _Memoirs_, \"when General Clarke entered, to request that\r\nwe would come to dinner with Citizen Carnot. We accordingly adjourned\r\nthe conversation to the apartment of the President, where we found\r\nCarnot, and one or two more. Hoche, after some time, took me aside, and\r\nrepeated his question. I replied, '_Most decidedly a republic._' He\r\nasked again, 'Are you sure?' I said, 'As sure as I can be of anything.\r\nI know nobody in Ireland who thinks of any other system----.' Carnot\r\njoined us here, with a pocket-map of Ireland, and the conversation\r\nbetween Clarke, Hoche, and him became pretty general, every one else\r\nhaving left the room. I said scarcely anything, as I wished to listen.\r\nHoche related to Carnot the substance of what passed between him and\r\nme. When he mentioned his anxiety as to bread, Carnot laughed and said,\r\n'There is plenty of beef in Ireland--if you cannot get bread, you\r\nmust eat beef.' I told him I hoped they would find both; adding, that\r\nwithin twenty years Ireland had become a great corn country, so that at\r\npresent it made a considerable article in her exports.\"--Vol. ii. pp.\r\n14-18.\r\n\r\nThe patience of Wolfe Tone was sorely tried by many and unnecessary\r\ndelays; and, after all, the hopes of the Irish exiles ended only in\r\nmustering a regiment of their countrymen, which, instead of embarking\r\nfor Ireland, marched to the invasion of Spain, under the unfortunate\r\nColonel Lewis Lacy, the son of a race of hereditary Irish soldiers, as\r\nrelated elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the year following his double appointment as minister for the war\r\nand marine, Clarke made the German campaign on the staff of Bonaparte,\r\nand was present at the capture of the free city of Ulm, in the Swabian\r\ncircle, on the 17th October, 1805, and at other operations, which\r\ndrove the army of the Archduke Ferdinand across the Danube; and, on\r\nthe capture of Vienna by the corps of the brave Murat and Lannes, he\r\nwas named governor of the city and also of Upper and Lower Austria,\r\nCarinthia, Styria, Friuli, Trieste, &c. His moderation and justice in\r\nthis high command elevated him among the victors, and won him the love\r\nand esteem of the vanquished. He also received the cordon of Grand\r\nOfficer of the Legion of Honour, and soon after was ordered to define\r\nthe line of demarcation between Brisgau, in the kingdom of Wirtemberg,\r\nand the Grand Duchy of Baden.\r\n\r\nTwo months were spent by him in conferences and diplomacy. From\r\nthe 9th to the 20th of July, 1806, he was engaged with the Russian\r\nplenipotentiary, and their interviews were terminated by the wonderful\r\ntreaty which opened and ceded to France, Cattaro, a Venetian\r\nterritory in Dalmatia, with its capital, harbour, and citadel; and\r\nwhich maintained Gustavus IV. in possession of the ancient Duchy of\r\nPomerania, and left to be achieved, at an early period, the junction\r\nof Sicily to the kingdom of Murat--the whole being arranged by them,\r\nwithout condescending to ask the advice of Great Britain, which was\r\nthen the faithful ally of Prussia. This treaty was never ratified by\r\nthe Emperor Alexander. The other conferences took place between Clarke\r\nand Lord Yarmouth, to whom Charles Fox added the Scottish Earl of\r\nLauderdale; while, to assist Clarke, the French government added Jean\r\nBaptiste Champagny, the Duc de Cadore, who was only a spectator of the\r\nnegotiations, which were without result, and are of no consequence to\r\nthe reader; but Clarke, who had displayed his usual acuteness, tact,\r\nand skill in all his meetings with the Lords Yarmouth and Lauderdale,\r\nwas not a little proud of having prevailed upon M. D'Oubril to sign\r\ncertain clauses he submitted to him.\r\n\r\nRussia, however, was in no haste to evacuate Cattaro, and the Emperor\r\nAlexander began to augment his army; so from September, 1806, it became\r\nevident that if France declared war against Prussia, she would have to\r\nencounter Russia also. In the first meeting concerning these affairs\r\nClarke said, \"that the convention recently concluded with Russia\r\nwas for France equivalent to a victory; and that henceforward his\r\nmaster, the Emperor Napoleon, had the right of proposing articles more\r\nadvantageous than those he had lately made.\" He qualified the terms of\r\nthe treaty which he wished them to adopt, and in particular _l'uti\r\npossedetis_; of vague conversations on the politics of Rome, he said\r\nthat Bonaparte had never adopted this _uti possedetis_ for a basis,\r\nwithout which Moravia, Styria, and Carniola would have remained still\r\nin his hands.\r\n\r\nSimilar language, encumbered by diplomatic technicalities, was applied\r\nto the two envoys of Fox, but failed to succeed with them, as they\r\nwere resolved not to depart in a single instance from the basis of the\r\nposition taken before by the envoy of Prince Talleyrand. The death of\r\nCharles Fox put an end to all the hopes of peace, although Lauderdale\r\nand Champagny did not despair of procuring it until the 6th of October;\r\nbut by this time Clarke had set out for Germany, having accompanied\r\nNapoleon to the Prussian campaign. After the two battles of the 14th\r\nOctober, he was named Governor of Erfurt, a fortified city on the Gera,\r\nand capital of the Elector of Mentz. It was then crowded with Prussian\r\nprisoners, and with sick and wounded Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nFor having been more in the palaces than in the camps of Bonaparte, and\r\nbeing, moreover, of foreign blood, Clarke was reproached with being\r\nmore of a diplomatist than a soldier by those who were envious of the\r\nfavour shown him by the Emperor. While at Erfurt he caused the Saxon\r\ngrenadiers of Hündt to take arms, and supplied them with ammunition,\r\ncolours, and several pieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Napoleon summoned him to Berlin, and appointed him\r\ngovernor, saying:--\r\n\r\n\"I wish that in the _same year_ you should have under your orders the\r\ncapitals of two monarchies we have conquered--Prussia and Austria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus Clarke, the inevitable Clarke, was appointed Governor of\r\nBerlin,\" says De Bourienne, \"and under his administration the wretched\r\ninhabitants, who could not flee, were overwhelmed by every species\r\nof impost and oppression. As in the execution of every measure there\r\noperated the most servile compliance with the orders of Napoleon, so\r\nthe name of Clarke is held in detestation throughout Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nThe measures of Clarke, as Governor of Berlin, were doubtless\r\nmortifying, ruinous, and often sanguinary; but then it must be\r\nremembered that he was compelled to enforce the iron will, and obey the\r\nstern orders, of his inflexible master; though it must be acknowledged\r\nthat it would have been more noble in him to have softened them to\r\nthe vanquished Prussians. The military contributions were rigorously\r\nlevied, and those were not the least of the severities exercised\r\nupon the people of Berlin. Offences were uselessly created, and then\r\nbarbarously judged of by a military commission.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of the unfortunate Burgomaster of Ciritz is forgotten\r\namid the many barbarous executions of which Prussia became the theatre,\r\nand against which her people dared not protest. When the king,\r\nFrederick William, found himself seated with Clarke at the table of\r\nLouis XVIII. in 1815, he could not refrain from bitterly reproaching\r\nClarke with what he termed \"the useless murder of the father of a\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" responded Clarke, \"it was an unfortunate error.\"\r\n\r\n\"An error, monsieur?\" reiterated the king, striking his hand upon the\r\ntable; \"an error--it was a crime!\"\r\n\r\nWithal, it must be acknowledged that Clarke, in the high place he\r\noccupied, fulfilled, in every way, the trust reposed in him by\r\nNapoleon; and that during his command at Berlin, which occupied a year,\r\nhe gave ample proof of his inflexible probity; and we may perhaps\r\nbelieve, that many of the accusations made against him were the echoes\r\nof those complaints which are naturally raised by the vanquished\r\nagainst the troops of the victor. Doubtless he would have received\r\ngreater praise had he striven to please others more, and his master\r\nless. By the official collections of Schoell, we are informed that\r\nVendomme one day wished to appropriate to himself the magnificent\r\nfurniture in the palace of Potsdam, where he resided; but that Clarke,\r\nby his determined intervention, forced him to relinquish the idea.\r\n\r\nClarke was again named minister of war, _vice_ Marshal Berthier,\r\nDuke of Neufchatel and Prince of Wagram. He acquitted himself with\r\ngreat credit during his administration, which was prolonged without\r\ninterruption for several years; but it was marked by two remarkable\r\nepisodes--the descent upon Walcheren in 1809, and the conspiracy of\r\nMallet in 1812. But we ought previously to have mentioned that in 1808\r\nClarke had been ennobled by the title of Count Hunebourg, and in 1809\r\nhe was created Duc de Feltre, from a town in Venetian Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the British upon Walcheren took Clarke by surprise;\r\nbut seconded by Bernadotte and Fouche he collected, in less than five\r\nweeks, an army of 100,000 men, near the mouths of the Scheldt, to watch\r\ntheir operations; but the swamps of South Beveland, and the Walcheren\r\nfever, proved more deadly to the British troops than the bayonets of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon was absent on his disastrous Russian campaign, the\r\nunfortunate disturbance, or rather wild enterprise of the republican\r\nGeneral Mallet, with his compatriots Guidal and Lahoire, placed Paris\r\nfor some hours in the hands of an armed mob. The coolness and presence\r\nof mind exhibited by Clarke during this momentous crisis is above all\r\ncommon praise. Mallet forged an account of Bonaparte's death; and on\r\nobtaining twelve hundred men from the 10th cohort of the National\r\nGuard, made prisoners M. Pasquer and Savary, the Duke of Rovigo, and\r\nassailing General Hullin, Commandant of Paris, in his quarters, shot\r\nhim through the head by a pistol-ball. Mallet led his party to seize\r\nClarke as minister of war; but the plot was soon discovered, and Mallet\r\nwas captured and disarmed. This finished his proposed reassertion of\r\nthe Republic, and fourteen of his followers were put to death, while\r\nClarke ordered the arrest of many others upon very slight suspicions.\r\nHe then dispatched to Bonaparte a report, which displayed his own\r\nvigilance and acuteness in escaping the snare into which General\r\nHullin, Colonel Soulier, Savary, and Pasquer had fallen so easily.\r\n\r\nThe excessive zeal of Clarke began to relax about the end of 1813,\r\nalthough his language always continued the same; thus, when Napoleon,\r\nacting under the pressure of his disasters in Russia, proposed to make\r\na peace, and yield up some of his conquests, the Duc de Feltre, knowing\r\nhow to touch one of the sensitive chords in his breast, said, \"that he\r\nwould consider the Emperor dishonoured if he consented to abandon the\r\nsmallest village which had been united to the Empire by a senatorial\r\ndecree!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a fine thing it is to talk!\" added old Bourienne.\r\n\r\nClarke's opinion, however, prevailed with Napoleon, and the war, so\r\nfatal to him, continued; though without doubt, in his secret soul,\r\nhe had begun to see the exact and perilous position of the Emperor.\r\nBefore the startling events of March, 1814, when the allies advanced\r\nupon Paris, and before the communications of Joseph had forced the\r\ndetermination of the Assembly, the acute Clarke had advised, very\r\ndecidedly, the departure of Maria Louisa, who set out at once for\r\nBlois. The ostentatious language with which he accompanied this\r\nadvice failed to deceive any one; but in spite of his efforts it was\r\nsingularly cold and discouraging.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his oration by a vivid picture of the conflicting state of\r\nparties, and of the state of Paris and its environs; and his enemies\r\naccused him not only of exaggerating the dangers which menaced the\r\ncapital, but of concealing its actual resources; but one fact is\r\nevident, Clarke was clearly and honestly of opinion that Paris was\r\nindefensible, and that to resist would be to destroy it! It is said\r\nthat Bonaparte had a contrary opinion, though it was not then publicly\r\navowed.\r\n\r\nWhen once Maria Louisa had left Paris, Clarke, foreseeing its certain\r\ncapitulation, did not take the necessary measures either to defend it\r\nor to check the progress of the allies. For three days he did not open\r\nthe arsenals to the Parisians, nor would he allow them to transport the\r\ncannon from the Hôtel des Invalides, and the Ecole Militaire to the\r\nheights about the city; finally he clubbed all the troops of the line\r\nabout Montmartre. \"Posterity,\" says a recent writer, \"will decide if\r\nthese measures were correct.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed the battle of Paris; Marshal Marmont's return within its\r\nwalls; the nights of the 30th and 31st of March; the capitulation;\r\nthe entry of the allies, and the strange enthusiasm with which the\r\nvacillating population received them. Napoleon was dethroned by a\r\ndecree of the Senate, and a Provisional Government was formed; and\r\nchanging, like many others, in that time of change, to this new\r\ngovernment, Clarke sent in his formal adhesion on the 8th of April,\r\nabout one week after Paris was taken.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of the following June he was created, by Louis XVIII., a\r\npeer of France.\r\n\r\nWhen Marshal Soult retired from office, King Louis appointed Clarke\r\nMinister of War--the same post he had held under the Emperor, who was\r\nthen maturing plans of new operations in the little isle of Elba.\r\n\r\nIt was tauntingly said of Clarke that it was his destiny and misfortune\r\nto see the affairs of both Bonaparte and the Bourbons go to wreck,\r\nwhile entrusted to his care.\r\n\r\nThe _Memoirs of St. Helena_ assure us that Clarke, during the events\r\nof the Hundred Days, wished to _retake_ service under the Emperor\r\nNapoleon! If so, how different was his conduct from the faith that\r\ncharacterized Ney, Cambronne, and Macdonald! A rumour of this, in 1815,\r\nled to the immediate departure of Clarke for Ghent, where, at the\r\nfugitive court of Louis XVIII., he exercised his functions as Minister\r\nof War; and from thence, some time after, he travelled to London,\r\ncharged with a mission from the king to the Prince Regent, afterwards\r\nGeorge IV.\r\n\r\nDuring the time the allied armies occupied Paris, Clarke had a\r\nremarkable interview with the King of Prussia. On this occasion he was\r\naccompanied by M. de Bourienne and Marshal Berthier. They remained for\r\nsome time in the saloon, before his Prussian Majesty appeared from his\r\ncloset, and when he did so, the embarrassment of his manner, and the\r\ncloudy severity of his countenance, was apparent to the three visitors.\r\n\r\n\"Marshal,\" said he to Berthier, \"I should have preferred receiving you\r\nas a peaceful visitor at Berlin; but war has its successes, as well\r\nas its reverses. Your troops are brave and ably led; but you cannot\r\noppose numbers, and Europe is armed against the Emperor; patience has\r\nits limits. You have passed no little time, marshal, in making war on\r\nGermany, and I have great pleasure in saying to you that I shall never\r\nforget your conduct, your justice, and moderation in those seasons of\r\nmisfortune.\"\r\n\r\nMarshal Berthier, who deserved this eulogium, made a suitable reply;\r\nafter which the King of Prussia turned sternly to the Duc de Feltre,\r\nsaying,--\r\n\r\n\"As for _you_, General Clarke, I cannot say the same of your conduct\r\nas of the marshal's. The inhabitants of Berlin will long remember your\r\ngovernment. You abused victory strangely, and carried to an extreme\r\nmeasures of rigour and vexation. If I have an advice to give you, it\r\nis--_never show your face in Prussia_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clarke was so overwhelmed by this reception from a crowned head,\" says\r\nM. de Bourienne, \"that Berthier and myself, each taking an arm, were\r\nabsolutely obliged to support him down the grand stair.\"\r\n\r\nOn returning to King Louis, at Ghent, he resumed his duties of Minister\r\nfor the War Department; and assuredly his task was both a severe and a\r\ndifficult one.\r\n\r\nHe had to arrange the disbanding of the Imperial and the\r\nre-organization of a Royal army; he had to examine and decide upon the\r\nvarious claims presented by hundreds of soldiers; he had to satisfy\r\nthe demands of two thousand officers who adhered to the king, and to\r\nsend them into the interior; he had to classify nine thousand officers\r\nof the disbanded army; to arrange for the pay of six thousand others\r\nwho were _re-formed_--that is, continued on pay, but without being\r\nregimented; he had to examine six thousand claims for arrears of pay\r\nand pensions, claims that could admit of no delay, and which amounted\r\nto forty-six millions of francs; he had to organize the Royal Garde du\r\nCorp; to reconstitute the gendarmerie; to provide for the maintenance\r\nof the allied armies of occupation; and all this he had to do, amid\r\nobstacles, disorders, and complexities without example.\r\n\r\nSuch was the mighty mass of labour submitted to the care of Clarke; and\r\nof this herculean task he nobly and ably acquitted himself in less than\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nAll impartial writers unite in exculpating him from the angry and\r\nunjust accusation of peculating with the enormous sums which were\r\nrequired and absorbed by the re-organization of the French army. But he\r\nwas severely handled by military men for instituting those tribunals\r\nstyled _Les Cours Prévotales_.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1815, Clarke was with Louis XVIII. at Arnouville, and\r\nwhile there saved his friend, François Marquis de Lagrange, a\r\nlieutenant-general who in 1813 commanded the 3rd Regiment of Gardes\r\nd'Honneur, from great danger, if not from death. The marquis had been\r\naccused of offering his services to Napoleon, and hastily arrived at\r\nArnouville with his son, on the 30th June. As he was about to wait upon\r\nLouis he was assailed by several soldiers, in whose hearts the love of\r\nNapoleon was strong. They called him a _traitor_, and tore away his\r\nsword, cross, and epaulettes. On becoming aware of these outrages,\r\nClarke sent two influential officers to repress the tumult, and himself\r\nled the marquis to Louis XVIII., who appointed him captain of the Black\r\nMusketeers.\r\n\r\nThe zeal which Clarke now employed in the cause of the house of Bourbon\r\nwas ultimately the means of his downfall. Louis XVIII., who each day\r\nconceded more and more to the enemies of his dynasty, after bestowing\r\nupon Clarke the bâton of a Marshal of France, displaced him from\r\noffice, and appointed Gouvin St. Cyr in his room.\r\n\r\nWe know that after his dismissal all was changed in the department of\r\nthe Minister of War.\r\n\r\nThe position in which Clarke found himself during the last years of his\r\nstirring, active, and useful life was very painful and humiliating,\r\nespecially to one of so proud a spirit as his. Some of the more\r\nfavoured personages who crowded the court of Louis XVIII., could not\r\nbehold with a favourable eye this foreigner, who had been the War\r\nMinister of the great Napoleon, a confidant of his, and his co-operator\r\nin a thousand schemes of conquest; on the other hand, his old comrades\r\nof the Imperial army affected to see in Clarke a deserter, a transferer\r\nof his allegiance, and, indeed, all but a traitor. Those whose base\r\nextortions he had repressed in other times now joined their clamours\r\nagainst him, and the Royalists cared not to say a word in his defence.\r\n\r\nThus, at the end of his career, he was unjustly despised alike for his\r\ntalents and virtues, as for his mistakes and weaknesses--for the good\r\nhe had done as well as for evil. Clarke now found himself isolated and\r\nabandoned, and the conviction of this, together with the coldness with\r\nwhich he was treated, sank deeply into his proud and sensitive heart.\r\n\r\nIt aggravated an illness which preyed upon him, and he died on the 28th\r\nof October, 1818, in his fifty-third year.\r\n\r\nSuch was the career of the Duc de Feltre, one of the most famous of the\r\nIrish exiles.\r\n\r\nClarke was master of many languages. He wrote with ease, with elegance,\r\nand with correctness; his style was often brilliant, and he knew\r\nthoroughly all that appertained to the details of a war administration.\r\nThe state of complete disorganization in which he found the French\r\nservice after March, 1814, proves the admirable tact and skill with\r\nwhich he could bring order out of disorder.\r\n\r\nMany of the old Imperialists, his enemies, coarsely accused him of\r\ntreason and treachery, but Napoleon takes care partly to exculpate him\r\nfrom charges so severe. On being asked at St. Helena if he believed\r\nthat Clarke had been true to him, the fallen Emperor said, with a sigh--\r\n\r\n\"True to me--yes, when I was in my strength;\" and after a time he\r\nadded--\"I cannot boast of him being more constant to me than Fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThis lessens the alleged crime of Clarke, while, at the same time, it\r\nlessens his nobility of conduct; though it must be acknowledged that he\r\ndid not leave Napoleon until he could no longer be of service to him.\r\nThe Emperor was not easily deceived as to the fidelity of a follower.\r\n\r\nFrom Bourienne we know that, in 1796 and 1797, after all that passed\r\nbetween Napoleon and Clarke, the former still trusted in the latter,\r\nand never attempted to interrupt his despatches to the Directory or\r\nto the Chevalier de la Croix; and nothing was ever found in them\r\ndispleasing to the Commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\nTwo great traits in the character of Clarke were, first, his hatred\r\nof all peculation and political knavery; the other was his mania for\r\noffice, and the despatches and details connected therewith. So poor was\r\nhe during the earlier years of his career, that Napoleon had to portion\r\none of his daughters; and no instance of profusion or luxury has been\r\ncited against him.\r\n\r\nInflated by his patent of nobility, he wished to make his genealogy\r\ngreat and lofty, and one day he believed that he had discovered his\r\ndescent, by the female side, from the Plantagenets--an idea which\r\nexceedingly amused Napoleon, who once said to him in a numerous\r\ncompany, about the time of his projected invasion of Britain,--\r\n\r\n\"Clarke, you have not yet spoken of your claims to the English\r\nthrone--you ought _now_ to make them good!\"[16]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Biographie Universelle_, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL KILMAINE,\r\n\r\nCOMMANDANT OF LOMBARDY AND GENERAL OF THE ARMÉE D'ANGLETERRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Jennings Kilmaine, a gallant and celebrated general in the\r\nFrench army, was born in Dublin in the year 1750, and was descended\r\nfrom an ancient Irish family which had always been strongly attached to\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion, and opposed to the interests of England.\r\nSo deep was the animosity of his father to the church and government\r\nas established in Ireland, that in 1765 he took Charles to France, and\r\nthere recommended him, when only in his fifteenth year, to enlist as a\r\nprivate hussar in the Regiment de Lauzun, a distinguished cavalry corps\r\nof the old French service, raised originally in the departement of the\r\nGaronne. He accompanied this corps to America, where he served in the\r\nWar of Independence under the celebrated Marquis de Lafayette, Grand\r\nProvost of the kingdom of France, and was present in most of those\r\nbattles in which Washington and his generals so signally discomfited\r\nthe troops of Great Britain. Association with officers of the United\r\nStates army, added to those impressions made upon him during his youth\r\nin Ireland and the teachings of his father, caused Kilmaine to imbibe\r\nstrongly the sentiments of a revolutionist.\r\n\r\nHe repeatedly distinguished himself in action; and his colonel, the\r\ngallant Biron, after passing him through the more subordinate ranks,\r\nappointed him sous-lieutenant of a troop.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the war, the Irish hussar returned with his\r\nregiment to France, full of those ideas of liberty and insurrection\r\nwhich he had seen so signally triumphant in the New World; and nearly\r\nall his brother officers had imbibed the same opinions. Thus it was\r\nwith ill-concealed joy that the young Kilmaine and his comrades, the\r\nHussars de Lauzun, in 1789, saw a Revolution which seemed destined to\r\nachieve results like those they had witnessed in America, break forth\r\nin old monarchical France.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 he was appointed captain of his troop, and continued to serve\r\nwith the hussars, who became so much attached to him, that during the\r\ntumults of 1794 he contributed greatly, by his influence, presence\r\nand example, to retain under their colours nearly the whole of the\r\nregiment, which like the regiment of Royal Germans and the Hussars de\r\nSaxe, seemed disposed to desert _en masse_. Thanks to the patriotic\r\nzeal displayed by Kilmaine in the cause of his adopted country, the\r\nofficers of noble family who chose to become emigrants were alone lost\r\nto the service; but this proved to him a new source of advancement, and\r\nhe was soon appointed a _chef d'escadre_, which in the French army is\r\nequal to the rank of a general officer, being commander of a division;\r\nand about this time he enjoyed the friendship of his countryman, the\r\nComte O'Kelly, who was ambassador of France at Mayence, with an income\r\nof 30,000 livres per annum.\r\n\r\nAs a chef d'escadre Kilmaine served throughout the first campaigns of\r\nthe Revolution, and under Dumourier and Lafayette commanded a corps of\r\nthat army which burst into the Netherlands and annexed that territory\r\nto republican France.\r\n\r\nHe fought with remarkable bravery at the great battle of Gemappes,\r\non the 6th November, 1792, and with his hussars repeatedly charged\r\nthe Austrians, driving them _sabre à la main_ along the road that\r\nleads from Mons to Valenciennes; and so pleased was his general, the\r\nunfortunate Dumourier, that in the moment of victory he named him\r\ncolonel; but this nomination was not confirmed by the minister of war.\r\nHowever, he was soon after gratified by a brevet of maréchal de camp,\r\nwhich made him, in rank, second only to a lieutenant-general.\r\n\r\nHe continued to serve with this army, and to be one of its most\r\nactive and able officers, during all the sufferings which succeeded\r\nthe victory at Gemappes. It consisted of forty-eight battalions of\r\ninfantry, and three thousand two hundred cavalry. In December, by the\r\nneglect of the Revolutionary Government, these troops were shirtless,\r\nshoeless, starving and in rags; fifteen hundred men deserted; the\r\ncavalry of Kilmaine were soon destitute of boots, saddles, carbines,\r\npistols and even sabres; the military chest was empty, and six thousand\r\ntroop and baggage horses died at Lisle and Tongres, for want of forage.\r\n\"To such a state,\" says Dumourier, \"was the victorious army of Gemappes\r\nreduced after the conquest of Belgia!\"\r\n\r\nHonourable testimony has been given to the unceasing efforts of\r\nKilmaine to preserve order among his soldiers amid these horrors;\r\nand with other staff-officers, he frequently endeavoured by private\r\ncontribution to make out a day's subsistence for their men, who roved\r\nabout in bands, robbing the villages around their cantonments at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, and in revenge many were murdered by the peasants when\r\nfound straggling alone beyond their out--posts.\r\n\r\nAfter the defection and flight of General Dumourier, Kilmaine adhered\r\nto the National Convention, and by that body was appointed a general\r\nof division; and now he redoubled his energies to restore order in\r\nthe army, which by the defection of its leader was almost disbanded;\r\nthus, in one month after General Dampierre took command, so ably was he\r\nseconded by Kilmaine, the discipline was completely established.\r\n\r\nHe commanded the advance-guard of Dampierre in the new campaign against\r\nthe allied powers, on the failure of the congress at Antwerp on the\r\n8th of April, 1793; and his leader bears the highest testimony to the\r\ngallantry and noble conduct of Kilmaine, in the \"murderous affairs of\r\nthe 1st and 2nd May;\" in which, according to the official report, he\r\nhad two chargers shot under him.\r\n\r\nSix days of incessant skirmishing succeeded, during which Kilmaine\r\nnever had his boots off, nor returned his sabre once to the scabbard;\r\nand he displayed the most reckless valour on the 8th of May, in that\r\nbattle fought by Dampierre to deliver Condé.\r\n\r\nThe French were routed with great loss; Dampierre was slain; and on\r\nKilmaine as an active cavalry officer devolved the task of covering the\r\nretreat of the infuriated and disorderly army, which fell back from\r\nCondé-sur-l'Escaut, which is a barrier town, and was then the nominal\r\nlordship of the unfortunate Duke d'Enghien.\r\n\r\nOn General la Marche succeeding Dampierre, he sent Kilmaine with his\r\ndivision to the great forest of Ardennes, which formed a part of\r\nthe theatre of war, on the invasion of France by the allies; but he\r\nremained there only a short time, and rejoined the main army, which he\r\nfound in the most critical circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Dampierre and the arrestment of Custine acted fatally on\r\nthe army of the North, which was now reduced to about thirty thousand\r\nrank and file, and these remained in a disorderly state, without a\r\nproper chief, and without aim or object--its manoeuvres committed to\r\nchance or directed by ignorance; for, with the exception of Kilmaine,\r\nits leaders were destitute of skill, experience, and energy. Quitting\r\nthe camp of Cæsar, they returned to their fortified position at\r\nFamars, three miles distant from Valenciennes, the approach to which\r\nit covered. Here they were attacked on the 23rd of May, driven back,\r\nand obliged to abandon the city to its own garrison under General\r\nFerrand; a success which enabled the allies under the Duke of York\r\nto lay immediate siege to Condé and to Valenciennes, the two most\r\nimportant barrier towns upon the northern frontier. While the army of\r\nthe North continued in full retreat towards the Scheldt, the British\r\ncommander-in-chief briskly attacked Valenciennes, which General Ferrand\r\nfirst laid in ashes, and then delivered up; his garrison, as the reward\r\nof their obstinate defence, being permitted to march out by the gate of\r\nCambray, on the 28th of July, with all _the honours of war_. Condé had\r\nalready fallen on the 10th of the same month.\r\n\r\nGeneral Custine, who in the two preceding campaigns had rendered such\r\nessential services to the faithless Convention, was meanwhile brought\r\nto trial on the charge of corresponding with the enemy, and fell a\r\nsacrifice to the malice of his accusers.\r\n\r\nIt was on the banks of the Scheldt that Kilmaine rejoined the army\r\nearly in August, with his division from Ardennes; and now his position\r\nbecame almost desperate. In presence of the scaffold erected by the\r\nferocious mutineers for all the vanquished generals, and in a camp\r\nwhere no suspected person dared to assume the precarious office of\r\nleader, when pressed upon him, he accepted the bâton provisionally, and\r\nin the meantime said to the representatives who were sent from Paris to\r\nmanage affairs and act as spies upon the army, \"that he wished another\r\nmore skilful than himself should take the great responsibility of\r\nleading the troops of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nHis presence for a time appeased the tumults in the army. Though upon\r\nthe banks of the Scheldt, and having before him both the Duke of York\r\nand the Prince of Coburg, Kilmaine, with only twenty-four thousand\r\nill-appointed troops, dared not attempt to attack them; for if he\r\nfought and lost the day, he could thereafter assume no position of\r\nsufficient strength to prevent the allies from penetrating to Paris\r\nand crushing the power of the Convention. After so many levies and\r\nenrolments, that body had no longer a battalion to spare, and had\r\naround it only the frothy orators of armed clubs, and the refuse of\r\nprisons; thus it dared not abandon the capital or retire beyond the\r\nLoire, for now the men of Poitou, Bretagne, and La Vendée were in arms\r\nunder the white banner, and elsewhere the tides of war and politics\r\nwere setting in against them. At this crisis Mayence had capitulated,\r\nafter a three months' bombardment. Toulon was under the cannon of the\r\nBritish; the Spaniards had invaded Roussillon; the Austro-Sardinians\r\nmenaced Provence, the ancient patrimony of the House of Anjou; and on\r\nthe Alps their troops hung over Dauphine and Vienne; finally, after\r\nthe revolution of the 31st of May, which had assured the triumph of\r\nRobespierre, Lyons, Marseilles, and all the departments of the south,\r\nwith those of the west, were roused against the pride, power, and\r\noppression of the Convention.\r\n\r\nIf it was really true that the allied monarchs wished to re-establish\r\nthe fallen throne of Louis XVI.,--if, as they had so proudly announced\r\nin their manifestos, it was to restore order to bleeding and desolated\r\nFrance, and to repress the Republic and its horrors,--they had\r\ndisplayed their standards in the Netherlands, never were circumstances\r\nmore favourable to them than after the retreat of Kilmaine towards\r\nthe Scheldt: but the secret measures of wily diplomatists had more\r\ninfluence then, on events, than the arms of the allied kings.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, in the second campaign, when the allies were masters\r\nof Condé and Valenciennes, and saw that the road to Paris was almost\r\nopen to them, the Austrians wished to take their revenge locally for\r\nthe cruel deeds of which they had been spectators in the Camp de\r\nla Lune; and were more intent upon gratifying this sentiment than\r\nadvancing into the heart of France.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Coburg had shown himself from the first frank, loyal, and\r\ngallant; he had promised to Dumourier to concur in his daring project\r\nfor re-establishing the monarchy, and for that purpose had engaged\r\nto form an auxiliary force to aid him, while solemnly renouncing all\r\nprojects of aggrandizement for the crown of Austria. But for these\r\nengagements he had not received from his cabinet either instructions or\r\nauthority. When Thugut was supreme director of the Austrian affairs,\r\nit was to these rash promises of the prince his consent was required;\r\nhe disapproved of them so strongly, that they were cancelled by the\r\nEmperor of Austria, and a congress met at Antwerp, where, in concert\r\nwith Britain, it was decided that in the result of the war the allies\r\nought to find indemnities for the past, and guarantees for the future\r\npeace of Europe.\r\n\r\nThese were the expressions of the protocol which the members of the\r\ncongress comprehended without difficulty; but French diplomatists\r\nloudly declared that a projected dismemberment of France was clearly\r\nannounced in its phraseology.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain: not a reference was made therein to the House of\r\nBourbon, or to the throne of Louis--that throne of which Dumourier,\r\nin concert with the Prince of Coburg, had so boldly promised the\r\nrestoration in his manifesto of the 5th April; and not a measure was\r\ntaken for the advantage or safety of the beautiful and unhappy Marie\r\nAntoinette, then languishing in prison at Paris, and over whose devoted\r\nhead hung the blade of the guillotine, and whom a simple menace from\r\nher nephew the Emperor, threatening the advance of his armies, might\r\nperhaps have saved.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it seemed sufficiently evident to the jealous and\r\nexcitable French that the allies were no longer true to the interests\r\nof the fallen Bourbons; and equally so that it was not to restore them\r\nthe Austrians at least made war. It was in _his own name_--not that of\r\nLouis XVII., king of France and Navarre--their emperor took possession\r\nof those fortified places and provinces which his armies overran; and\r\nafter he became master of Condé and Valenciennes, he no longer cared to\r\ndefine or form a frontier for those districts of the Netherlands which\r\nonce he proposed to cede to the Prussians; but which Thugut now wished\r\nto preserve to the descendants of Rudolph of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Duke of York, who from his own cabinet had\r\nreceived orders and instructions similar to those given to the\r\nPrince of Coburg, in the name of George III., resolved to seize upon\r\nDunkerque, which the English had coveted of old; but he did not wait\r\nfor the departure of a British fleet prepared for this object. The\r\nnaval squadron was delayed, and in the meantime the duke deliberated\r\nwith the Austrian general under the ramparts of Valenciennes, to\r\nlearn if, before engaging in new sieges, they might not give to the\r\nFrench army a final blow which would deprive Kilmaine of all power of\r\ninterrupting their combined operations.\r\n\r\nThis was a very simple question, yet they were fourteen days in\r\ncoming to a conclusion. Though Valenciennes, as already stated, had\r\ncapitulated on the 28th of July, it was not until the 8th of August\r\nthat the Austro-British army was in motion, and its advance guard\r\nbeheld the camp of Cæsar; this on the very day after Kilmaine had\r\nwisely evacuated the fortifications and retreated southwards.\r\n\r\nIt is said that he fully anticipated the march of the combined armies;\r\nand this was sufficiently probable, for we know that the committees\r\nof the National Convention had mysterious means of procuring secret\r\nintelligence, not only from the cabinets of the allies, but from the\r\nstaff officers of the German troops!\r\n\r\nKilmaine in retiring only obeyed the dictates of wisdom and necessity,\r\nand quitted a position which he could not defend, as his army was\r\nreduced by defeat and desertion, mutinous, or as the French style it,\r\n_demoralized_.\r\n\r\nIf the allies had wished to follow and engage him upon the Scarpe\r\nor the Somme, a last effort could easily have been made to disperse\r\nhis troops completely, and then seize upon Paris, where they might\r\nhave torn the Revolution from its very basis. But such was not the\r\nintention of the allied generals. \"Their aim on this occasion,\" says\r\na French writer, \"was to profit by our disorders and revolutions to\r\nmake themselves masters of our places and provinces after assuring\r\nthemselves of indemnities and guarantees, and to leave the volcano to\r\nconsume itself, as a Prussian prince said, not long ago: it must be\r\nadmitted, that never had this policy shown itself more evidently in its\r\nshameful nudity!\" But the reader must bear in mind that these are the\r\nopinions of a Frenchman and a sympathizer with the Convention.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of matters when Kilmaine, having abandoned the\r\nuntenable camp of Cæsar, and fallen back beyond the Scarpe, a navigable\r\nriver of French Flanders (but still a narrower barrier than the\r\nScheldt) prepared again for retreat, and marched towards the Somme,\r\nanother river which falls into the British Channel between Crotoy and\r\nSainte Valori. This was his last position--his last asylum; and now the\r\nchiefs of the allies, instead of pushing on in pursuit of his retiring\r\nbands to complete the triumphs so well begun, faced about, and wheeled\r\noff to seize Dunkerque and Quesnay.\r\n\r\nIt was in autumn that the Royal Duke appeared before the former; and\r\nthere his troops received a check which proved but the commencement of\r\na long series of disasters; the latter was stormed by the Austrians,\r\nand retaken by the French in the following year.\r\n\r\nBut what must astonish us, even at this epoch of deception and\r\nduplicity, political insanity and revenge, is the startling fact that\r\nthe brave Kilmaine, who had rendered such gallant services to that new\r\nand most faithless Republic--he who by a judicious retreat (executed\r\n_against_ the advice of the meddling and presumptuous representatives\r\nof the people, and in consequence thereof perilled his life) had\r\npreserved to shattered France her most important army, was precisely\r\nfor that reason denounced to the Convention, arrested by its orders,\r\nand flung into a loathsome prisons at Paris, where he passed a year;\r\nbeing but too happy, in the obscurity of his dungeon, that he had not\r\nperished on the scaffold like the gallant Custine, his predecessor\r\nin the command; like his old colonel and protector Biron, and like\r\nHouchard, who for the brief period of fifteen days had been his\r\nsuccessor, and who, after winning a signal and decided victory over the\r\nDuke of York--a victory alike honourable to himself and to the arms of\r\nFrance, expiated by a cruel death the grave fault of having forgotten\r\nfor a moment the powers of a bullying representative of the people!\r\n\r\nKilmaine only recovered his liberty after the fall of Robespierre; but\r\nhe still remained for some time in Paris, without military employment,\r\nthough he eagerly and anxiously sought it. He found himself there at\r\nthe epoch of the insurrection of the 22nd May, 1795, and with much zeal\r\nand valour he seconded General Pichegru in the struggle made by that\r\nofficer to defend the National Convention against the excited mobs of\r\nthe Parisian fauxbourgs. Amid a thousand dangers Kilmaine continued\r\nto fight for the Convention until the 13th Vendemaire of the year\r\nfollowing, actively co-operating with Bonaparte and the revolutionary\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nBeing appointed to the command of a division in the army of Italy, he\r\nmarched with Napoleon across the Alps to the invasion of that country,\r\nand shared in the glory of his first victories, and in that brilliant\r\ncampaign in which the French destroyed two armies, took two hundred\r\nand eighty pieces of cannon, and forty-nine stand of colours from the\r\nAustrians, who were commanded by the veteran Wurmser, the bravest of\r\nall brave men.\r\n\r\nAt the head of his division Kilmaine fought with remarkable courage at\r\nCastiglione delle Stiviere, a fortified town in Lombardy, where, in\r\nthe beginning of August, 1796, several severe engagements took place\r\nbetween the French and Austrians, which resulted in the discomfiture of\r\nthe latter. Mantua was the next scene of Kilmaine's achievements; and\r\nin July that ancient city, after fifty years of peace, beheld the army\r\nof Napoleon before its walls, while all the country on the right bank\r\nof the Po was laid under contribution.\r\n\r\nThe whole direction and charge of the siege of Mantua was committed\r\nto Kilmaine by Bonaparte in September, when Wurmser, after being\r\nsuccessful against General Massena, was overthrown by Augereau and our\r\nIrish soldier, and after a six days' contest shut himself up in the\r\ncity on the 12th, after which the siege was pressed with great vigour.\r\nTwice after this did an Austrian army under Alvinzi attempt its relief,\r\nand twice were they baffled by the besiegers; on the last occasion an\r\nadvancing corps of seven thousand men were compelled to surrender to\r\nBonaparte and Kilmaine within gunshot of the walls, and the position of\r\nthe aged Wurmser, his garrison, and the Mantuans, became desperate in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nIn an action before Mantua in October, Kilmaine had his horse killed\r\nunder him, and a rumour was spread through France and Britain that he\r\nwas killed. Wurmser made several furious sallies, and on one occasion\r\nwas severely routed by Bonaparte. In the _Courier du Bas Rhin_, we\r\nare told that the French repulsed him with the loss of eleven hundred\r\nmen and five pieces of cannon, and that \"their dispositions were made\r\nby General Kilmaine, commander of the siege of Mantua.\" Bonaparte, in\r\nhis dispatch to the Directory, dated the first day of October, writes\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 20th of September, the enemy advanced towards Castellocio,\r\nwith a body of horse 12,000 strong. Pursuant to the orders they\r\nhad received, our advanced posts fell back, but the enemy did not\r\npush forward any further. On the 23rd September, they proceeded to\r\nGovernolo, along the right bank of the Mincio, but were repulsed, after\r\na very brisk cannonade, with the loss of eleven hundred men and five\r\npieces of cannon.\r\n\r\n\"_Le Général Kilmaine_, who commands the two divisions which press the\r\nsiege of Mantua, remained on the 29th ultimo in his former position,\r\nand was still in hopes that the enemy would attempt a sortie to carry\r\nforage into the place; but instead they took up a position before the\r\ngate of Pradello, near the Carthusian convent and the chapel of Cerese.\r\nThe brave General Kilmaine made his arrangements for an attack, and\r\nadvanced in two columns against these two points; but he had scarcely\r\nbegun to march when the enemy evacuated their camps, their rear having\r\nfired only a few musket-shots at him. The advanced posts of General\r\nVaubois have come up with the Austrian division which defends the\r\nTyrol, and made one hundred and ten prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nIn November a series of sanguinary actions were fought between the\r\nFrench and Austrians at Arcola, where the latter were completely\r\noverthrown; and there fell Citizen Elliot, a Scotsman, who was one of\r\nBonaparte's principal aides-de-camp. During this time Kilmaine was at\r\nVicenza with three thousand men; all the French cavalry were sent there\r\nto be under his orders; and though still commanding the operations\r\nagainst Mantua, he shared in the disastrous battle fought near Vicenza\r\nby the aged Alvinzi, who was advancing to raise the siege. Despairing\r\nto reach Mantua, the latter fell back upon the Vicenza road, and was\r\nrouted after a bloody conflict of eight hours' duration.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, Wurmser led a sortie, sword in hand, against\r\nKilmaine. The Imperialists sallied out of Mantua at seven in the\r\nmorning, and almost in the dark, under a furious cannonade, which\r\nlasted all day; \"but General Kilmaine,\" says Bonaparte, \"made him\r\nreturn, as usual, faster than he came out, and took from him two\r\nhundred men, one howitzer, and two pieces of cannon. This is his third\r\nunsuccessful attempt.\" So energetic were the measures, and so able the\r\nprecautions of Kilmaine, that Wurmser, seeing all hope of succour at\r\nan end, surrendered, after a long, desperate, and disastrous defence,\r\nat ten o'clock on the morning of the 3rd February, 1797, giving up\r\nhis soldiers as prisoners of war. The following is a translation of\r\nKilmaine's brief letter on this important acquisition:--\r\n\r\n \"Kilmaine, Général de Division and Commandant of Lombardy, to the\r\n Minister of War. Milan, 17 Pluviose (Feb. 5), 1797.\r\n\r\n \"Citizen Minister--I avail myself of a courier which General Bonaparte\r\n sends from Romagna (in order to announce to the Directory the defeat\r\n of the Papal troops), to acquaint you with the capture of Mantua, the\r\n news of which I received yesterday evening by a courier from Mantua\r\n itself. I thought it necessary to announce this circumstance, because\r\n General Bonaparte, who is occupied in Romagna annihilating the troops\r\n of his Holiness, may probably have been ignorant of this fact when\r\n _his_ courier departed. The garrison are our prisoners of war, and\r\n are to be sent into Germany in order to be exchanged. I have not yet\r\n received the articles of capitulation; but the commander-in-chief will\r\n not fail to send them by the first courier.\r\n\r\n \"Kilmaine.\"\r\n\r\nThe capture of Mantua was celebrated in Paris by the firing of cannon\r\nand the erection of arches in honour of Bonaparte and the Irish\r\nCommandant of Lombardy, and a general joy was diffused through every\r\nheart in the city on the fall of what they styled the _Gibraltar_ of\r\nItaly; while Bonaparte, loaded with the diamonds of the vanquished\r\nPope, and the spoils of our Lady of Loretto, pushed on to seek fresh\r\nconquests and new laurels.\r\n\r\nKilmaine remained for some time in command at Mantua after its\r\ncapitulation.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege and other events, a revolutionary spirit had pervaded\r\nthe Venetian States. Peschiera, a fortified town in the province of\r\nVerona, and Brescia, a large city in the beautiful plain on the Garza,\r\nhad been both seized, garrisoned, and republicanized by the French.\r\nThe people rose in arms, fired by new and absurd ideas of liberty and\r\nequality, and frightful scenes of bloodshed ensued when the more loyal\r\nand sensible inhabitants resisted these new patriots; but the latter,\r\non being joined by fifteen hundred banditti from Bergamo, pressed the\r\nVenetian troops, who were driven out with great slaughter.\r\n\r\nOn hearing of these things, the politic Kilmaine wrote from Mantua\r\nto the French general commanding in Brescia, desiring him \"_not_ to\r\ninterfere in behalf of these insurgents, lest by so doing he might\r\ninfringe that strict neutrality which the generals of the French\r\nRepublic were bound to observe.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, however, he was compelled, by the violent proceedings of the\r\nItalians against the French garrison in Verona, to unite his forces\r\nto those of Generals Victor and La Hotze, and march to the succour of\r\nGeneral Ballaud, who was there assailed by forty-five thousand men,\r\nwhose war-cry was _Viva San Marco!_ who had cut to pieces six hundred\r\nFrenchmen, taken two thousand more after a four hours' contest, and\r\ndriven the rest into the castle. From its ramparts Ballaud threatened\r\nto lay in ruins the unfortunate city, which had enjoyed profound peace\r\nfor ages, until Bonaparte arrived on the banks of the Adige, and added\r\nit to the new kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th the insurgent Veronese capitulated, for on the approach of\r\nKilmaine the governor, the two proveditori, and the Venetian general\r\nStratico, fled with all their cavalry; on which he took as hostages\r\nthe bishop, four of the principal nobles of the city, and several\r\ncavaliers of distinction, and peace was thus restored for a time. He\r\ndisarmed all the insurgents, and seized three thousand slaves, whom he\r\nmarched under an escort to Milan. In every way Kilmaine aided Napoleon\r\nmost efficiently in these operations which preceded the capture and\r\nsubjugation of Venice; and thus gave his great leader a thousand causes\r\nto admire and appreciate him during those campaigns which were so\r\ndisastrous to Italy, but so glorious to the arms of France. During his\r\ncommand in Lombardy he settled or compromised the contested question of\r\nthe free navigation of the Lake of Lugano, in the south of Switzerland,\r\nwhich had occasioned many angry disputes between the jealous Switzers\r\nand the aggressive generals of the French army in Italy. By his\r\nintervention it was satisfactorily arranged that France should have\r\nthe open navigation of the lake by boats of any size: but the cantons\r\nviolated the treaty; on which Napoleon threatened to send a column of\r\nhis troops among them, if they did not behave more amicably towards\r\ntheir faithful and ancient allies.\r\n\r\nAt this time General Sir John Acton, the favourite minister of Naples\r\nat Milan, was a soldier of fortune, and the intimate friend of\r\nKilmaine. The story of Acton is rather a singular one.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a Jacobite gentleman who had emigrated to France\r\nand settled at Besançon. An unsuccessful love adventure forced him\r\nto leave that city, at the college of which he was studying physic\r\nwith every prospect of distinction. Repairing to Toulon, he enlisted\r\nin a battalion of French marines. From this corps he passed into the\r\nNeapolitan service, and distinguished himself at sea against a Barbary\r\ncorsair; on which he received a commission in the marines of Naples,\r\nand rose to the rank of general, Counsellor of State, and Knight of San\r\nGennaro and Saint Stephen. He possessed a high spirit, great courage,\r\ngood address, and a handsome figure; and he soon became at the Court of\r\nNaples what the Prince of Peace was at Madrid--the favourite and lover\r\nof the Queen. He died in 1811. Another of Kilmaine's friends was the\r\nveteran general O'Cher, a _chef de brigade_, who had been upwards of\r\nforty years in the service of Louis XVI. and of the Republic, and held\r\nan important command in the army of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs_ published by General Count Montholon, and which were\r\nwritten by that faithful officer at St. Helena, we have the following\r\ndescriptive reference to the Commandant of Lombardy:--\r\n\r\n\"Kilmaine, being an excellent cavalry officer, had coolness and\r\nforesight; he was well fitted to command a corps of observation,\r\ndetached upon those arduous or delicate commissions which require\r\nspirit, discernment, and sound judgment. He rendered important\r\nservices to the army, of which he was one of the principal generals,\r\nnotwithstanding the delicacy of his health. He had a great knowledge of\r\nthe Austrian troops: familiar with their _tactiques_, he did not allow\r\nhimself to be imposed upon by those rumours which they were in the\r\nhabit of spreading in the rear of an army, nor to be dismayed by those\r\nheads of columns which they were wont to display in every direction, to\r\ndeceive as to the real strength of their forces. His political opinions\r\nwere very moderate.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the words of a brother soldier, who must have known him well\r\nin the land of his adoption.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1798, the French Government was seriously employed\r\nin preparations for a descent upon the British Islands; and, in the\r\nFebruary of that year, marched to the coast of the Channel forty\r\ndemi-brigades of infantry, thirty-four regiments of cavalry, two\r\nregiments of horse artillery, two regiments of foot artillery, six\r\ncompanies of sappers and pioneers, six battalions of miners and\r\npontooniers. These forces were led by eighteen distinguished generals\r\nof division, and forty-seven generals of brigade--the most brave and\r\nable in France. Among the former were Charles Kilmaine, Berthier,\r\nMarescat, Kleber, Massena, \"the son of Rapine;\" Macdonald, Ney, Victor,\r\nand others whose names were to become famous in future wars as the\r\nmarshal dukes of the great military empire.\r\n\r\nThe brave but blustering Jean Baptist Kleber, who had originally been\r\nan architect of Strasbourg, commanded the right wing of this _Armée\r\nd'Angleterre_, which was to stretch from Calais to the mouth of the\r\nScheldt, while another corps assembled at Flushing.\r\n\r\nKilmaine commanded the centre.\r\n\r\nThese forces were partly composed of troops returned from Italy, and\r\nwere all experienced soldiers, the victors of Mantua, Lodi, and Arcola.\r\nHeaded by bands of music, the _étât-majors_ marched through Paris,\r\ndisplaying black banners, indicative of a war of extermination, and\r\ninscribed, \"_Descent upon England_--Live the Republic! May Britain\r\nperish,\" &c.\r\n\r\nOn St. Patrick's day, the 17th of the following month, Kilmaine,\r\nO'Cher, Colonel Shee, and all the Irishmen in Paris celebrated their\r\nancient national and religious festival by a grand banquet, at which\r\nthe notorious Thomas Paine--then a political fugitive--assisted. All\r\nthe corresponding members of the Irish clubs and malcontent party at\r\nhome were also present. Many fierce and stirring political toasts\r\nwere drunk, amid vociferous enthusiasm; and among these--one in\r\nparticular--\"Long live the Irish Republic!\" and speeches were made\r\nexpressive of the rapid progress which republicanism had made in\r\ntheir native country, and of the strong desire of the Catholics and\r\nDissenters to throw off the yoke of England--that yoke which Kilmaine\r\nin his boyhood had been taught to abhor and to hate. Napper Tandy, a\r\n_general de brigade_, was in the chair; on his left sat Tom Paine, and\r\non his right sat Kilmaine, who, immediately after the banquet, left\r\nParis to rejoin his column of the army on the coast.\r\n\r\nFive hundred gunboats were ordered to be prepared, and three hundred\r\nsail of transports were collecting at Dunkirk, to be protected from the\r\nBritish fleet by a Dutch squadron then at the mouth of the Scheldt; and\r\nall Britain was in arms on hearing of an armament so formidable.\r\n\r\nThe condition of France was then desperate; assignats were at 6500\r\nlivres the louis; she had to maintain a million of men in arms from\r\nan empty treasury; the ruffian demagogues and savage soldiers of the\r\nRepublic, men steeped to the lips in the blood of women and priests,\r\nnobles and aristocrats, hardened by the atrocities in La Vendée, and\r\ntrained to the war in the campaigns of Austria and Italy, occupied\r\nevery post and place under the unstable government; a rabble of\r\nbrutal ministers occupied the palaces of the fallen line of St. Louis,\r\narmed with sabres and pistols, to which they resorted in every trivial\r\ndispute and on every difference of opinion, and while warring against\r\nall manner of title and form, appeared on the rostrum in cassocks and\r\nstockings of rose-coloured silk, with knots of scarlet ribands in their\r\nshoes; and, with that mixture of ferocity and tom-foolery which caused\r\nParis to be characterized as a city of monkeys and tigers, debated on\r\nthe cut of a coat and the massacre of a city.\r\n\r\nIn April, Kilmaine repaired to Paris, after having executed, by order\r\nof the government, a survey of the coasts of France and Holland, then\r\nreduced to a province of the former; and the chief command of this\r\nfamous Armée d'Angleterre on which the eyes of all Europe were fixed,\r\nand the command of which had been given to the noble Dessaix, the hero\r\nof Marengo, was now bestowed upon him.\r\n\r\nA French writer asserts that this expedition was destined, not for\r\nBritain, but for Egypt; and that Kilmaine received the command of it,\r\nnot so much for his great military skill, as to deceive our ministry;\r\nsupposing that the name of an Irishman would cause them to believe\r\nthat the armament was destined for Ireland; and so they named him\r\nGeneral in Chief of the Armée d'Angleterre, which never existed at all.\r\nUnfortunately for this writer, history affords abundant proof to the\r\ncontrary. The number of transports was soon increased to a thousand,\r\nand all the naval and military resources of Holland were pressed into\r\nthe French service.\r\n\r\nColonel Shee, Wolfe Tone, Generals Clarke and Kilmaine, were by this\r\ntime well acquainted with the extent of the military organization\r\nof the United Irishmen, and knew that by the close of the preceding\r\nyear the people were well provided with arms, and knew the use of\r\nthem. In the beginning of 1797, great quantities were discovered and\r\nseized by the British Government, who, in Leinster and Ulster alone,\r\ncaptured 70,630 pikes, with 48,109 muskets. Had the Irish managed\r\ntheir projected rising with the vigour which has ever characterized\r\nthe Scottish insurrections, we cannot for a moment doubt what would\r\nhave been the result, had this formidable expedition once landed in\r\nIreland, where no yeomanry were organized; where the militia were not\r\nto be depended upon; and where the king's troops, on whom the ministry\r\nmainly relied, were so little superior to the French in tact and skill,\r\nthat Humbert, with less than a thousand men, was able to defeat double\r\nthat number, and immediately after received into his ranks 250 of the\r\ndrilled and attested Irish militiamen.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th April, Kilmaine, with General Bonaparte, had a long\r\naudience with the Directory at Paris, reporting on the state of their\r\narmaments. The appointment of the former to the chief command relieved\r\nBritain of the apprehension that the conqueror of Italy would cross the\r\nChannel in person, and great was the disappointment of the malcontents\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThe duties of Kilmaine were alike harassing and arduous, as he had to\r\nsuperintend the equipment and organization of this vast force, composed\r\nof men of all arms and several nations; and he was repeatedly summoned\r\nto Paris, even in the middle of the night, by couriers who overtook him\r\nin his progresses; thus, though suffering under severe ill health, the\r\nDirectory once brought him on the spur from Bruges early in July, and\r\nagain from Brest about the end of the same month.\r\n\r\nCitizen d'Arbois, an officer on the staff of Kilmaine, in a letter\r\npublished in the Parisian papers of the 7th August, 1798, states that\r\nhis general \"is on his return,\" after having made a tour of the coast,\r\nfrom Port St. Malo to L'Orient; that he was well satisfied with the\r\nstate of the French ports and armaments, and had enjoyed with delight\r\nthe magnificent aspect of Brest, in the harbour of which he saw thirty\r\nsail of the line, with a fleet of frigates and transports. D'Arbois\r\nstates that Kilmaine had been surveying Brittany, where all was then\r\npeaceful, by the \"wise measures\" of the constituted authorities. \"The\r\neagerness with which our troops, both by sea and land, await the moment\r\nwhen, under the brave Kilmaine, they will engage the English, is the\r\nbest pledge of our approaching success, and the ruin of our enemies.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Citizen d'Arbois had then no thought of fighting in\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nBut doubts hovered in the minds of the Directory, if there were none in\r\nthe hearts of their generals, and long delays ensued. General Hoche,\r\nunder whom the future Dukes of Rovigo and of Vicenza were serving as\r\nprivate soldiers, and who was the main spring of the projected movement\r\nin favour of Ireland, died in September, 1797; and Bonaparte, to whom\r\nKilmaine, Tone, Shee, and others of the Irish patriots turned, had no\r\nsympathy with their cause, as all his views were now directed towards\r\na warfare in the East. By the beginning of autumn the Directory began\r\nto break up their boasted Armée d'Angleterre, and withdrew their\r\ntroops to reinforce their columns on the Rhine. Upon this, Kilmaine\r\ncame anxiously and hastily to Paris to confer with the government and\r\nthe Minister of Marine concerning the embarkation of the troops and\r\ndeparture of the fleet from Brest; but his questions were waived, or\r\nleft unanswered, although the division of Bompard, consisting of the\r\n_Hoche_ of 74 guns and eighteen frigates, filled with troops under\r\nGeneral Hardy, destined for Ireland, remained with their cables hove\r\nshort, and all ready for sea at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nOf the forces that really sailed for Ireland, and their fate, we need\r\nnot inform the reader. For a time all Britain supposed they were led\r\nby the commander-in-chief in person; and all the press of England\r\nand Scotland teemed with blustering or scurrilous remarks on \"Paddy\r\nKilmaine and his followers;\" but the general never embarked, though he\r\ncertainly superintended the departure of a body of troops from Rochfort.\r\n\r\n\"We are assured,\" says a Brussels print, \"that in case the French\r\nrepublicans shall be able to make a successful descent upon Ireland,\r\nthe Belgic youth will be employed in that country under General\r\nKilmaine, who, being a native of it, will there have the command of\r\nthe united French and Irish forces.\" Citizen Macdonagh was to have\r\na high command in the corps of Irish Marines. He held the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in France.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1798 the army of England and its expedition were alike\r\ndissolved, and the Directory wished to give Kilmaine command of the\r\nforces assembled for the war in Egypt; but for the present his career\r\nfinished with the military examination of the coasts of France and\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 the Directory appointed him generalissimo of the army of\r\nHelvetia, as they chose to designate Switzerland; thus reviving the\r\nancient name of the people whom Julius Cæsar conquered. The French\r\ntroops already occupied Lombardy on one side, and the Rhenish provinces\r\non the other; thus they never doubted their ability to conquer the\r\nSwiss and remodel the Helvetic constitution. Kilmaine accepted the\r\ncommand with satisfaction, but his failing health compelled him to give\r\nup his bâton to Massena; and with a sorrow which he could not conceal,\r\nhe saw that army march which penetrated into the heart of the Swiss\r\nmountains, and imposed on their hardy inhabitants a constitution in\r\nwhich Bonaparte, under the plausible title of Mediator, secured the\r\nco-operation of the valiant descendants of the Helvetii in his further\r\nschemes of conquest and ambition.\r\n\r\nIn a feeble condition Kilmaine returned to Paris, where his domestic\r\nsorrows and chagrins added to the poignancy of his bodily sufferings,\r\nfor his constitution was now completely broken up.\r\n\r\nStruck by a deadly malady, he died on the 15th of December, 1799, in\r\nthe forty-ninth year of his age, at the very moment when the triumphant\r\nelevation of Bonaparte was opening up to his comrades a long and\r\nbrilliant career of military glory. He was interred with all the\r\nhonours due to his rank and bravery, and a noble monument was erected\r\nto his memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTS O'REILLY, O'DONNEL,\r\n\r\nAND THE IRISH IN SPAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland, says a popular Scottish writer, can boast not only of having\r\ntransplanted more of her sons to the soil of Spain than either of the\r\nsister kingdoms, but of having acquired by the deeds of her exiles a\r\ndegree of renown to which the others cannot aspire.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, that in every land brave men find a home!\r\n\r\nThe deeds of the Irish regiments in the Spanish service, during the\r\nWar of the Succession, like those of the O'Donnels in the war of the\r\nPeninsula, and the civil strife of more recent times, would fill\r\nvolumes. Of the Spanish Lacys I have already given a memoir; and of\r\nmany other brave Irish soldiers of fortune, who won distinction on the\r\nsoil or in the service of Spain, I can here give but the names alone.\r\n\r\nOwen Roe O'Neil, of Ulster, rose to high rank in the Spanish Imperial\r\nservice and held an important post in Catalonia. He defended Arras\r\nagainst Louis XIII. in 1640, and when forced to surrender, he did so,\r\nsays Carte, \"upon honourable terms; yet his conduct in the defence\r\nwas such as gave him great reputation, and procured him extraordinary\r\nrespect even from the enemy;\" and the brave O'Sullivan Bearra of\r\nDunbuy, who fled in the days of James I., became Governor of Corunna\r\nunder Philip IV.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Don Carlos Felix O'Neile (son of the celebrated Sir\r\nNeil O'Neile of Ulster, slain at the battle of the Boyne), was Governor\r\nof Havannah and favourite of Charles III. of Spain; he died at Madrid\r\nin 1791, after attaining the great age of one hundred and ten years.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, Colonel O'Moore commanded the Royal Walloon Guards of Charles\r\nIII. In 1799, Field-Marshal Arthur O'Neil was Governor-General\r\nof Yucatan under the same monarch, and commanded the flotilla of\r\nthirty-one vessels which made an unsuccessful attack on the British\r\nsettlements in the Bay of Honduras. In the same year, Don Gonzalo\r\nO'Farrel was the Spanish ambassador at the Court of Berlin, and in\r\n1808 he was Minister of War for Spain. In 1797, O'Higgins was Viceroy\r\nof Peru, under Charles IV., one of whose best generals was the famous\r\nAlexander Count O'Reilly.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro O'Daly was Governor of Rosas when it was besieged by Gouvion\r\nSt. Cyr in 1809; and General John O'Donoughue was chief of Cuesta's\r\nstaff, and one of the few able officers about the person of that\r\nindolent and obstinate old hidalgo, whose incapacity nearly caused the\r\nruin of the Spanish affairs at the commencement of the Peninsula war.\r\nHe died Viceroy of Mexico in 1816.\r\n\r\nO'Higgins was Viceroy of Peru under Ferdinand VI. and the third and\r\nfourth Charles of Spain. He signalized himself with great bravery in\r\nthe wars with the Araucanos, a nation on the coast of Chili, who were\r\nultimately subdued by him and subjected to the Spanish rule. John\r\nCampbell, a midshipman who escaped from the wreck of the _Wager_, one\r\nof Commodore Anson's squadron which was lost on the large island of\r\nTierra del Fuego, and who arrived, after inconceivable sufferings, at\r\nSt. Jago de Chili, furnished O'Higgins with various notes and outlines\r\nof the coast, and other memoranda concerning the natives, all of which\r\nhe had ingeniously written on the bark of trees. These observations,\r\nwhich were afterwards printed in England, were of the greatest value to\r\nO'Higgins, who was wont to affirm that by the knowledge they gave him\r\nof the barbarians under his government, \"he owed the foundation of his\r\ngood fortune to Campbell.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1765, he marched against the Araucanos with a battalion of Chilian\r\ninfantry, and fifteen hundred horse, named Maulinians. He was thrice\r\nbrought to the ground by having three horses killed under him; but the\r\nAraucanos were routed, and the Spanish rule extended over all Peru, of\r\nwhich he died viceroy in the beginning of the present century, after\r\nfighting the battles of Rancagua and Talchuana, which secured the\r\nindependence of Chili.\r\n\r\nFew names bear a more prominent place in Spanish history than those of\r\nBlake, the Captain-General of the Coronilla, and O'Reilly, a soldier\r\nof fortune, who saved the life of Charles III. during the revolt at\r\nMadrid, and who re-formed and disciplined anew the once noble army of\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER COUNT O'REILLY was born in Ireland about 1735, of Roman\r\nCatholic parents, and when young entered the Spanish service as a\r\nsub-lieutenant in the Irish regiment with which he served in Italy\r\nduring the war of the Spanish Succession, and received a wound from\r\nwhich he was rendered lame for the rest of his life. In 1751 he went\r\nto serve in Austria, and made two campaigns against the Prussians,\r\nunder the orders of Marshal Count Lacy, his countryman. Then in 1759\r\nhe passed into the service of Louis XV., under whose colours was\r\nstill that celebrated Irish Brigade whose native bravery so mainly\r\ncontributed to win for France the glory of Fontenoy.\r\n\r\nO'Reilly distinguished himself so much that the Marshal de Broglie\r\nrecommended him to the King of Spain, with great warmth of expression,\r\non his retiring to Madrid. The marshal's interest won him the rank of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, and as such he served in that war which conduced\r\nso little to the glory of Portugal, though favoured by the alliance\r\nof Britain. Nevertheless, O'Reilly found many opportunities for\r\ndistinction at the head of the light troops which were confided to him,\r\nand soon won the proud reputation of being one of Spain's most gallant\r\nofficers. He was now named Brigadier of the Armies of the King, with\r\nthe post of _aide major de l'exercise_. In these capacities he drilled\r\nthe Spanish infantry according to the best system of tactics and\r\nexercise then practised in the British service.\r\n\r\nAt the peace he was appointed Mariscal de Campo, and named Commandant\r\nen Seconde of Havannah, which was to be given up to Spain by the treaty\r\nof Fontainbleau. On arriving there, he restored and strengthened the\r\nfortifications of the colony, and soon after returned to Spain, where\r\nthe king named him Inspector-General of Infantry, and desired him to\r\nassist in the manoeuvres of a great camp, of which he gave him command.\r\nHe then sent him to New Orleans, where the inhabitants had scarcely\r\nbecome accustomed to the Spanish yoke, and where the rigorous means\r\nemployed by O'Reilly to subdue them gained him many enemies. The count\r\nreturned again to Madrid, and was treated with every mark of favour\r\nby Charles III., who knew all his talents, capacity, and courage; and\r\ncould never forget that it was to the strong hand and stout heart of\r\nO'Reilly he owed his life during the fiery sedition at Madrid in 1765,\r\nwhen the people rose in arms. Every honour Charles could bestow upon\r\na foreigner was showered upon O'Reilly, who now gave the Spanish army\r\n(which was many years behind every other in Europe in the march of\r\nprogression and improvement) a new spirit, vigour, and impulse. In this\r\ntask he was assisted by his brother-in-law, Francisco Xavier Castanos,\r\nafterwards Duke of Baylen, Captain-General of Estremadura, Old Castile,\r\nand Galicia, whom he took with him to Prussia when he visited that\r\ncountry, like all the principal officers of Europe, to witness and\r\nexamine the manoeuvres practised by the troops of the Great Frederick.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, he obtained command of the expedition against Algiers. The\r\ngreat means of attack were entirely confided to him, and he sailed from\r\nthe Spanish coast with a squadron of forty sail of the line and three\r\nhundred and fifty transports, carrying an army of thirty thousand men;\r\nbut this immense armament failed to achieve its object, and O'Reilly\r\nwas compelled to bear away for Spain, humiliated and mortified, and\r\nlanded his discomfited troops at Barcelona, on the 24th of August in\r\nthe same year.[17] Though this unfortunate result was much against his\r\nreputation as a general, it did not lessen his favour with the king,\r\nwho placed him at the head of a military school which was established\r\nin Avila, at Puerto de Santa Maria, on the Adaga, in Old Castile.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, O'Reilly was named Captain-General of Andaluzia and\r\nGovernor of Cadiz. In these important posts he displayed the talents\r\nof a skilful soldier and able administrator; but he fell into complete\r\ndisgrace on the death of Charles III., in 1788, and lived afterwards\r\nin a quiet retreat in Catalonia. Despite his many enemies at court,\r\nwho rose into power with Charles IV., O'Reilly maintained his high\r\nmilitary reputation in the Spanish army, and on the death of General\r\nRicardos in 1794, the government knew of none so able as he to direct\r\nthe war against the invasion of the French republican armies. He was\r\naccordingly named General of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees, and was\r\non his way to assume that high command when he was seized by a sudden\r\nillness, and died in his sixtieth year.\r\n\r\nO'Reilly was fortunate, perhaps, in escaping thus the misery caused to\r\nSpain by the mistakes of the Conde de la Union, and the misfortunes\r\nconsequent to reverse and defeat. His age would not have permitted\r\nhim to sustain the fatigue of a war so active; and though he was the\r\ninstructor of Blake and others who were esteemed the best officers\r\nof the Spanish army, as a foreigner he had many envious enemies, and\r\nall his ability as a soldier, with the sweetness and insinuating\r\nflexibility of his manner, was no guarantee to him among such a people\r\nas the Spaniards, who are ever cool and averse to strangers.\r\n\r\nHis pupil, Joachim Blake, afterwards Captain-General of Aragon and\r\nfour other provinces, was the son of an eminent Irish merchant who had\r\nsettled at Velez, near Malaga, and was descended from an ancient family\r\nin the county of Galway. His mother was the daughter of a wealthy\r\nSpanish banker named Joyes.\r\n\r\nAt an early age young Blake manifested an ardent predilection for\r\nthe profession of arms--a predilection inherent in his race, which\r\nhad given Ireland many proofs of high valour during two centuries.\r\nWhile yet a boy he applied himself to the science of mathematics with\r\ngreat success, and was soon appointed Superintendent of Cadets in the\r\nmilitary school established by Count O'Reilly, at Puerto de Santa\r\nMaria. In 1773, Blake commenced his military career as a volunteer in\r\nthe Regiment of America, for it has long been an established principle\r\nin the Spanish armies that candidates for commissions must learn\r\nthe art of war in the ranks; and for some years subsequent to this\r\nhe served as lieutenant and adjutant to the battalion, so great was\r\nthe progress he had made in his profession, and so intimate was his\r\nknowledge of regimental economy. At the beginning of the war waged\r\nby France against Spain, he was appointed Major of the Volunteers\r\nof Castile, without serving the intermediate rank of captain; a\r\nfavour never before granted to any officer, even to a Spaniard. In\r\nthis capacity he led his battalion with distinguished bravery during\r\nthe campaigns of 1793 and 1794, in Roussillon and Catalonia, and\r\nwas wounded when storming the heights of San Lorenzo de la Maga. He\r\nwas appointed colonel in 1802, without passing through the grade of\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and obtained command of a newly-raised battalion,\r\nstyled _Los Volontarios de la Corona_--the Volunteers of the Crown;\r\nand from thenceforward he bore a prominent part in all the warlike and\r\npolitical broils of Spain.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace in 1802, Blake was made brigadier or Mariscal de\r\nCampo, by Charles IV., and on his volunteer regiment being numbered\r\nwith the Spanish line, he was further confirmed in command of it. This\r\nposition he occupied until the invasion of Spain by Bonaparte and the\r\nimprisonment of the king; after which ensued the great contest known\r\nas the Peninsula War, during which, by the unanimous voice of the\r\nGalicians, he was summoned to the chief command of their valuable and\r\nextensive province.\r\n\r\nDuring the second operations of Marshal Bessières (Duke of Istria)\r\nin Spain, the army of Blake--twenty thousand strong--united with the\r\nten thousand Castilian recruits of old Don Gregorio de la Cuesta, at\r\nBenevente in July, 1808, for the purpose of opposing him; but they soon\r\ndisagreed; for, contrary to the wishes of Blake, whose fiery energy\r\nconsorted ill with the indolence of Cuesta, that officer left a strong\r\ndivision to protect stores at Benevente, and led only twenty-five\r\nthousand infantry, a few hundred horse, and thirty pieces of cannon,\r\ntowards Palencia, in the beautiful Tierra de Campos. _Contrary to his\r\njudgment_, a battle was risked (14th July, 1808) at Medina del Rio\r\nSeco, against the French under General Lasolles.\r\n\r\nThere, on that day, so fatal to Spain, notwithstanding all the energy\r\nof Blake, General Lasolles, with fifteen thousand men and thirty\r\ncannon, routed the soldiers of Castile and Galicia, with the loss of\r\nseven thousand two hundred of their number, killed, wounded, or taken;\r\nand the survivors fled with such absurd precipitation, that the French,\r\nin crossing the bed of the Sequillo in pursuit, and finding it dry and\r\nstony, exclaimed: \"Diable! Why, Spanish rivers run away, too!\"\r\n\r\nThe generals of the two Juntas separated in anger; but Blake had\r\ndiscovered such talents in the lost battle, that he was appointed\r\nGovernor and Captain-General of the Kingdom of Galicia, and President\r\nof the Royal Audience.\r\n\r\nHe retreated towards the mountains, and Bessières then entered the city\r\nof Leon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Junta of that province and of Castile sided with Blake,\r\nto whom Marshal Bessières sent twelve hundred of the prisoners taken\r\nat Rio Seco; and believing it to be a favourable opportunity to tamper\r\nwith their leaders, he wrote urging them to obey the act of abdication,\r\nand acknowledge Joseph Bonaparte, in whose name he offered Blake high\r\nrank and honours if he would enter the French service, like Colonel\r\nO'Meara of the Irish Brigade, Clarke the Duc de Feltre, General\r\nKilmaine, Marshal MacCarthy, and other Irishmen; while to Cuesta he\r\nvery _liberally_ offered the Viceroyalty of Mexico; but both the\r\nSpanish cavalier and the Irish soldier of fortune repelled his offers\r\nwith disdain.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th September the latter advanced against the enemy with six\r\ncolumns, each five thousand strong. Descending from La Montana towards\r\nthe Upper Ebro, he sent one division to menace the French in the Castle\r\nof Burgos, and turn the flank of Marshal Bessières; he left another\r\nat Villarcayo to preserve a communication with Reynosa and cover his\r\nretreat. He received supplies from General Broderick, who in his\r\ndespatches complained bitterly that Blake treated him with hauteur, and\r\ndeclined to afford any information as to the nature of his intended\r\noperations. The French having abandoned Bilbao, it was regarrisoned by\r\nMarshal Ney; and after various evolutions, it was attacked on the 12th\r\nOctober by Blake, at the head of eighteen thousand men. Merlin, with\r\nthree thousand French, abandoned the fortress and retreated, fighting\r\nevery foot of the way until he reached Zornosa, where he was succoured\r\nby General Verdier, who checked the fury of Blake's pursuit. The winter\r\nwas now approaching, and his troops began to be in want. Seldom have\r\nsoldiers endured greater privations than those suffered by the poor\r\nSpaniards of Blake. They were destitute of caps, boots, and stockings,\r\nand had been constantly in the open air for months, without tents or\r\nproper food; yet not a murmur escaped them, nor a wish was uttered but\r\nto conquer for their country.\r\n\r\nWhile the well appointed forces of France were hourly increasing,\r\nBlake, fearing neither difficulty nor danger, boldly ascended the\r\nvalley of El Darongo to assail two divisions of the Fourth corps\r\n(Lefebre, Duke of Dantzig's), which occupied the neighbouring villages.\r\nFull of hope, he advanced, and anticipating, if successful, to capture\r\nMarshal Ney's corps of sixteen thousand men, fearlessly, with only\r\neighteen thousand Spaniards, and almost without artillery, he hastened\r\nto engage twenty-five thousand Frenchmen of all arms!\r\n\r\nFavoured by a dense mist, the Spaniards entered the valley, and for\r\na time nothing was heard but the shots of their skirmishers ringing\r\nbetween the mountain peaks, till Vilatte's corps suddenly fell on\r\nBlake's vanguard, and hurled it back upon the third division at the\r\nbayonet's point. Then, on came the dark columns of Sebastiani and\r\nLaval, each looming in succession through the mist, while a fire of\r\nround and grape-shot from their artillery (to which Blake could not\r\nreply) swept through the rocky vale, heaping his ranks against each\r\nother, and strewing them on the grass.\r\n\r\nMadly and bravely Blake, with his infantry and Guerillas, sought to\r\ndefend every rock and pass of the valley; but they were driven back\r\nin full flight towards Bilbao, and crossing the Salcedon, took up a\r\nposition at Nava, watched by seven thousand French under Vilatte.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Gamonal, Soult resolved to make an effort for\r\never _to cut off Blake_, who, without cavalry, clothing, or food, had\r\nreached Espinosa with six divisions and only six pieces of cannon,\r\nwhich he posted in rear of the town at Aguilar del Campo. He had now\r\nonly twenty-five thousand bayonets, but strongly and skilfully posted.\r\nHis left wing, composed of Asturians, and his old favourite division\r\noccupied the heights above the road to St. Andero; another covered the\r\nroad to Reynosa, and Romano's soldiers filled a wood two miles in his\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nHe was attacked at two o'clock on the 10th November by Marshal Victor,\r\nwhose soldiers carried the wood at the point of the bayonet, forced\r\nhis centre, turned his left flank, and he had the mortification to see\r\nSan Romano and Don Luiz de Riquelmé, his two best brigadiers, fall\r\nmortally wounded. His Spaniards were hurled in masses upon each other,\r\nand utterly routed. Romano's corps were all taken to a man; the rest\r\nfled through Castile, Leon, Galicia, and Asturia, carrying everywhere\r\nthe tidings of their defeat and the terror of the French name; and poor\r\nBlake, jaded, weary, exasperated, and disheartened, reached Reynosa\r\non the 12th, with only seven thousand men--his old division--without\r\nartillery, without arms, without spirit, and without hope!\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle of Espinosa. Blake, in this terrible condition, was\r\nattacked by the vanguard of Soult, and after losing two thousand men,\r\nretired through the vale of Caburniego, and reached Arnedo in the heart\r\nof the Asturian Sierras.\r\n\r\nSpain was now nearly prostrate at the feet of France!\r\n\r\nIn 1809, Blake was appointed Captain-General of the _Coronilla_, or\r\nLesser Crown; a title given to the union of Valencia, Aragon, and\r\nCatalonia. In the latter he succeeded General Romano. Gathering his\r\nforces in April, restless and indefatigable, he advanced to Alcanitz,\r\nfrom whence the French retired to Samper and Ixar. On this Marshal\r\nSuchet advanced against him with the third corps, and on the 23rd of\r\nMay they fought the battle of Alcanitz.\r\n\r\nBlake was skilfully posted in front of the town with twelve thousand\r\nmen. The bridge of Guadaloupe was in his rear; a pool of water covered\r\nhis left, but his right was without protection; his centre occupied\r\na hill. With only eight thousand foot and seven hundred horse Suchet\r\nattacked him, but without success. Rendered desperate by reverses,\r\nthe Spaniards stood firm, and fought with their ancient rather than\r\ntheir modern bravery. Suchet was wounded and compelled to retreat:\r\nthis retreat became a panic, and in great confusion the French reached\r\nSamper in the night. This small success was a cause for rejoicing all\r\nover Spain. \"The victory at Alcanitz,\" was in every man's mouth, and\r\nthe Supreme Junta gave Blake an estate, and added the ancient kingdom\r\nof Murcia to his command. He now hoped to recover the far-famed\r\nZaragossa, and turning all his thoughts to Aragon, neglected the\r\ndefence of Catalonia.\r\n\r\nAfter the late victory his little army was augmented by more than\r\ntwenty thousand men, and full of new hope and enthusiasm he marched\r\nwith these to Ixar and Samper.\r\n\r\nSuchet hovered near Zaragossa, but left a column under General Faber\r\nat Villa Muel, near the Sierra of Daroca, to watch Blake, who, hoping\r\nto cut that officer off, marched through Carinena, so famed for its\r\nvineyards, and sent General Arisayo with a detachment to Bottorio,\r\nwith orders to capture a convoy of French provisions on the Huerba.\r\nThis movement was successful, and lack of food forced Faber to retreat\r\ntowards Plascencia.\r\n\r\nThe advanced guards exchanged shots on the 14th of June at Bottorio,\r\nand Blake, full of confidence, made a vigorous attempt to surround\r\nthe French by pushing a column to Maria on the plains of Zaragossa;\r\non the 15th he formed his troops in order of battle, but slowly\r\nand unskilfully, as they were raw soldiers, who had but recently\r\nrelinquished the vinedresser's knife for the musket and sword.\r\nOccupying both banks of the Huerba, towards 2 p.m. he extended his left\r\nflank to overlap the French right; but Suchet, who was unexpectedly\r\njoined by Faber's brigade and another from Tudela, paralysed the\r\nmovement by a furious attack of cavalry and voltigeurs. Blake's left\r\nfell back at the very moment that he was triumphantly leading on his\r\ncentre, and he became involved in a desperate sword-in-hand conflict,\r\nin which the leading columns of Suchet were repulsed. He would have\r\nachieved more but for a violent storm which arose at that moment, and\r\nso darkened the air that the adverse lines could scarcely see each\r\nother, and for a time the action ceased. Blake's position was ill\r\nchosen (according to the memoirs of Suchet); he was surrounded by deep\r\nravines, and had only one line of retreat by the bridge of Maria, which\r\ncrossed the Huerba near his right wing.\r\n\r\nMarshal Suchet observed this error, and on the storm lulling, selected\r\nsome cavalry and two regiments of infantry, and forming them, all\r\ndrenched as they were by rain, in solid column, by a vigorous effort he\r\nbroke through Blake's brigade of horse, seized the bridge, and cut off\r\nhis retreat!\r\n\r\nUndaunted by this fatal event, Blake, at all times brave and decided,\r\nformed his infantry of the left and centre into solid masses, and\r\nfought desperately for victory; but was repulsed with great loss, and\r\ndefeated, leaving one general, twenty-five guns, and many colours on\r\nthat rough and rocky field, from which he was driven about dusk, when\r\nthe darkness was so dense that few prisoners were taken. Suchet had\r\nHarispe wounded and a thousand men slain.\r\n\r\nFavoured by the obscurity of the night, Blake's men fled by the ravines\r\nto Bottorio, where he made incredible efforts to rally and remodel\r\nthem next day. Then he received tidings that a French brigade, under\r\nLaval, was marching by the Ebro to cut off his retreat. To anticipate\r\nthis movement Blake fell back on the night of the 16th, and after\r\nskirmishing with Suchet next day at Torrecilla, _again_ formed line of\r\nbattle on the 18th, to meet him at Belchite, a small town in Aragon.\r\nBlake had on this day only fourteen thousand men, dispirited by\r\nrecent repulse and the loss of nearly all their artillery. Suchet had\r\ntwenty-two battalions and seven squadrons, with a fine artillery corps,\r\nall flushed by recent success, and making fifteen thousand men; thus\r\nthe result may be anticipated--a defeat!\r\n\r\nHe had four thousand of his men taken, with the remainder of his\r\nartillery, all his baggage and ammunition. He had many difficulties\r\nto contend with as leader of an undisciplined army, and stung to the\r\nsoul by this second defeat, he reproached the Spaniards with great\r\nbitterness as shameless cowards; and, after demanding an inquiry\r\ninto his own conduct, \"with a strong and sincere emotion of honour,\"\r\nrestored to the Junta the estate which had been conferred upon him\r\nafter the victorious battle of Alcanitz.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the victory of Belchite, Marshal Suchet sent detachments\r\nas far as Morella on the Valencian frontier; but no man in arms\r\nappeared to meet them, for Blake's dispersion was signal and complete.\r\nHis march towards Zaragossa, and his attempt to wrest Aragon from the\r\nfoe, were fatal to the Spanish cause in Catalonia, where St. Cyr, with\r\nmore than forty thousand men, occupied the country between Figueras\r\nand the city of Gerona, which was blockaded by eighteen thousand\r\nFrenchmen, who pressed with vigour one of the most memorable sieges\r\nsuffered by this ancient ducal city, which was bravely defended by its\r\nintrepid Catalans. Blake was ordered by the central Junta of Seville\r\nto succour them, as the garrison were defending half-ruined walls with\r\na valour and obstinacy which filled the city with a thousand scenes of\r\nhorror and distress. He marched accordingly at the head of a weak and\r\nirregular force, which was thoroughly dispirited by the result of the\r\ntwo last battles; and thus he resolved to confine his operations simply\r\nto supplying the town with men and provisions, rather than risk his\r\nstrength by attempting to raise a siege which, if essayed with success,\r\nwould save Gerona, and with it all Catalonia.\r\n\r\nCollecting two thousand mules laden with flour, he sent them with four\r\nthousand foot and five hundred horse, under Henry O'Donnel and Garcia\r\nCondé, towards this strong and picturesque little city, which they\r\nreached after a furious encounter with the enemy during a dark and\r\nstormy night; but the provisions received did not amount to much more\r\nthan eight days' food for the starving Geronese and their garrison,\r\nwhich was encumbered rather than aided by Garcia Condé's reinforcement.\r\nSt. Cyr now resolved to seek out Blake and destroy him for ever; but\r\nrendered wary by misfortune, he retired into the mountains, and thus\r\nended his first attempt to relieve the city of Gerona.\r\n\r\nSoon after, still hovering near the French, and threatening them, he\r\nadvanced to the position of St. Hilario; and on St. Cyr preparing to\r\nstorm the post called Calvary, Blake, from the 20th to the 25th of\r\nSeptember, 1809, made movements as if he meant to force the blockade;\r\nbut being incapable of doing so, his whole object was merely to\r\nintroduce another convoy; and, watching an opportunity, while drawing\r\nthe attention of St. Cyr towards the heights of San Sadurnia, on which\r\nhe had posted a column, he sent 10,000 men under Wimphen towards\r\nGerona. O'Donnel led the vanguard. A dreadful conflict took place on\r\nWimphen's attempting to force the French lines. He was defeated; and in\r\nthe twilight Blake failed to succour him; but Henry O'Donnel, another\r\ngallant Irish soldier of fortune, succeeded in hewing a passage into\r\nGerona with 1000 men and 200 laden mules. Irritated by Blake's second\r\nattempt to succour Gerona, St. Cyr marched a column to menace his\r\ncommunication with the citadel of Hostalric, a depôt of magazines on\r\nthe Tordera. On this he was forced to retreat, leaving to its fate the\r\nnoble little city of Gerona, which, as its heroic captain, General\r\nAlvarez, said, \"if not succoured again by all Catalonia, will soon be\r\nbut a heap of carcases and ruins.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on the 29th October, we find the unwearied Blake hovering on\r\nthe heights of Brunola, watching the siege of Gerona, and while he was\r\nthus occupied, Hostalric was stormed by the French, and 2000 Spaniards,\r\nwith all his magazines, were taken therein. On the 10th November Gerona\r\ncapitulated, and Alvarez, its brave and veteran governor, died of a\r\nbroken heart at Figueras, when on the march towards France, a prisoner\r\nof war. Blake now retired to Tarragona, leaving the remains of his\r\narmy under Henry O'Donnel, who drove Marshal Augereau into Gerona, and\r\nreceived command of the troops at Vich, on Blake being called into\r\nAndalusia.\r\n\r\nIn May the seaport of Tarragona was besieged, taken, and sacked by\r\nSuchet, in a manner discreditable alike to his talents as a soldier\r\nand his humanity as a man. During the horrors of that affair, which\r\ncovered the French with infamy, Blake was in Valencia, having sailed\r\nfor that province on the 16th of May, in search for succour; but\r\nTarragona was lost, and then he assumed command of the Murcian army,\r\nwhich was 22,000 strong, and had remained inactive ever since General\r\nO'Mahy's appointment. In June, 1811, the firmness and activity of\r\nWellington formed a strong contrast to the wavering and indolent\r\ndemeanour of the Spanish generals, until Blake marched to Condado de\r\nNiebla, on concerting a movement down the right bank of the Guadiana\r\nwith the British general, who delivered to him the pontoons lately\r\nused at Badajoz. He marched on the 18th, crossed the Guadiana on the\r\n22nd, at the ancient town of Mertola, where the stream first becomes\r\nnavigable: but halted at Castillegos on the 30th, and sent his siege\r\ntrain to Ayamonte by water. Then, instead of moving his whole force\r\ndirectly on the great city of Seville, he sent only a small column of\r\ncavalry, under the gallant Conde de Penne Villamur, in that direction;\r\nand, unfortunately, consumed two entire days in besieging the castle\r\nof Niebla--a small fortress, which gave the title of count to the\r\neldest son of the Duke of Medina, and was garrisoned by 300 Swiss,\r\nwho had deserted from the Spanish army at the commencement of the\r\nwar, and whom he was most anxious to capture and punish. The absence\r\nof his siege train rendered the attack futile; and Soult, on hearing\r\nof it, sent a detachment from Monasterio to relieve the Swiss, who\r\ndefended themselves with great valour, while General Conraux crossed\r\nthe mountains by the Aracena road, to cut off all communication between\r\nBlake and his artillery at Ayamonte. Thus he was compelled to abandon\r\nthe siege, and by a precipitate march reach a pontoon bridge which was\r\nthrown across the stream for him by Colonel Austin at San Lucar de\r\nGuadiana, from whence he took shelter in Portugal.\r\n\r\nStill indefatigable, he projected an assault upon San Lucar de\r\nBarameda; but the sudden appearance of Soult's advanced guard\r\ndisconcerted his troops, who retreated to Ayamonte, and from thence\r\nto the Isle of Camelas, where a Spanish frigate and 300 transports\r\nfortunately arrived in time to afford him the means of escape. Early in\r\nJuly he embarked all his troops, and sailed to Cadiz, as the French had\r\nreinforced San Lucar and taken possession of Ayamonte.\r\n\r\nLanding at Almeria, Blake formed a junction with Freire, and proposed\r\nto invest Granada; but deeming it necessary first to visit Valencia,\r\nwhere the factious Marquis del Palacio was acting most unwisely, he\r\nleft his army, now 27,000 strong, under Freire, and before he could\r\nreturn it had utterly dispersed!\r\n\r\nAfter the rout of the Murcians at Baza in Granada, he rallied the\r\nfugitives, and in virtue of his authority as regent assumed the chief\r\ndirection of the war in Valencia, where his noble efforts were nearly\r\nrendered futile by the villainy of Palacio's faction, who opposed him\r\nand endeavoured to detach the soldiers and people from his authority,\r\nand proposed to inundate the plains that lie round the black marble\r\nmountain of Murviedro; but on Suchet invading the province, Blake\r\nconcentrated his ill-armed and undisciplined but brave horde of\r\npeasantry to meet him. Exclusive of 5000 infantry and 700 Murcian\r\nhorsemen, under O'Mahy, at Cuença, and 2000 men under Bassecour at\r\nRiguena, in September, he had 20,000 foot and 2000 horse; but, as\r\na foreigner by name and race, he was unpopular both in Murcia and\r\nValencia, \"and the regency of which he formed a part was tottering,\"\r\nadds General Napier, in the fourth volume of his history. \"The Cortes\r\nhad quashed O'Mahy's command of the Murcian army, and even recalled\r\nBlake himself; but the order, which did not reach him until he was\r\nengaged with Suchet, was not obeyed. Meanwhile that part of the Murcian\r\narmy which should have formed a reserve after O'Mahy's division had\r\nmarched for Cuença, fell into the greatest disorder; above 8000 men\r\ndeserted in a few weeks, and those who remained were exceedingly\r\ndispirited.\"\r\n\r\nSuchet's army entered in three columns, passed Castellon de la Plana,\r\nmasked Pensicola, invested Oropesa, and skirmished at Almansora, where\r\na few French, by bravely routing a great body of Spaniards, made\r\nBlake doubt seriously the firmness of his troops; and thus leaving\r\nfour thousand men under O'Donnel at Segorbe, he retired beyond the\r\nGuadalquiver, leaving Valencia in confusion. Suchet then invested the\r\ntown of Saguntum, and again turning all his attention to destroy Blake,\r\nafter much manoeuvring, they fought their disastrous battle of the 25th\r\nOctober, 1811.\r\n\r\nOn the level and fertile plain which lies between Murviedro and\r\nValencia, and is intersected by torrents and ravines, fringed by\r\nolive-trees, Suchet drew out his lines of battle before the ramparts of\r\nSaguntum, where Blake was defeated, with the loss of 5000 men; and on\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon reinforcing Suchet with 15,000 men, under General\r\nReille (a Reilly of Irish parentage), the position of Blake and his\r\nAndalusians became more than ever desperate.\r\n\r\nHe had now fought _five pitched battles_ as a general, and had under\r\nhis command 22,000 foot and 3000 horse. In November, Suchet advanced\r\ntowards the Guadalquiver with a force diminished to 18,000 men by\r\ngarrisons and detachments. Though Blake had destroyed two of the\r\nbridges, and manned the houses, and was in hourly expectation of a\r\ngeneral rising of the Valencians, the French fearlessly stormed his\r\ndefences, crossed the river, menaced his front, and harassed his rear,\r\nuntil he was compelled to form an intrenched camp five miles in extent,\r\nenclosing the city of Valencia and three of its suburbs. A twelve-feet\r\nditch surrounded this camp, the slope of which was so high as to\r\nrequire ladders.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Valencia, fought in December, 1811, followed. O'Mahy\r\nwas defeated, and fled to Alcira, leaving Blake blocked up in the\r\nfortified camp with eighteen thousand men in want of provisions, while\r\nthe French were well and freely supplied by the _Valencians_, who, as\r\nBlake reports, \"were a bad people.\" On the 2nd December he made a bold\r\neffort to break through Suchet's lines, and sallied out at the head of\r\nten thousand men; but was repulsed, and Suchet pushed more vigorously\r\nthan ever the siege of the city, knowing well that it was impossible\r\nfor Blake to remain long in a camp which included a starving population\r\nof fifty thousand souls. The fire of sixty great guns drove Blake into\r\nthe city, abandoning his camp on the 5th December to the foe, who\r\nfound in it eighty pieces of cannon. In the evening Suchet summoned\r\nValencia; but Blake declined to yield. Then skirmishes, assaults, and\r\nbombarding continued till the 9th, when the citizens were on the point\r\nof insurging against Blake, and insisted that he should surrender. He\r\ncomplained bitterly of their cowardice, and required leave to march\r\nwith his soldiers to Alicant with their baggage, colours, and only four\r\npieces of cannon.\r\n\r\nThese terms were refused him.\r\n\r\nThe Valencians opened their gates, and the brave but unfortunate Blake\r\nwas compelled to surrender his sword, and march out at the head of\r\ntwenty-two generals, eight hundred and ninety-three other officers,\r\nand eighteen thousand men, as prisoners of war; leaving in the hands\r\nof the enemy eighty stand of colours, two thousand horses, three\r\nhundred and ninety pieces of cannon, forty thousand stand of arms, one\r\nhundred and eighty thousand pounds of powder, and three millions of\r\nball-cartridges, with a vast store of other warlike munition.\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of Valencia he had no opportunity of achieving anything\r\nof importance; and in May, 1812, the Regent Charles O'Donnel, Conde\r\nde Abispal, bestowed the command of the Valencian forces upon his own\r\nbrother Joseph, who rallied at Alicant the remains of Blake's army,\r\nfour thousand of whom escaped from Suchet's guards.\r\n\r\nFor his last important capture, Suchet was created Duke of Albufera;\r\nand poor Blake, as a prisoner of war too important to be exchanged, was\r\nordered into France with his two aides-de-camp.\r\n\r\nThe preceding has been but a brief outline of the career, services, and\r\nstruggles of Blake, whose popularity, by a combination of circumstances\r\nover which he had no control, was almost destroyed for ever in Spain.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied to the Spanish frontier by the Adjutant-General\r\nFlorestan Pipi, who was then sent to Naples. On entering France\r\nhe was sent to Paris, and from thence to the strong Château de\r\nVincennes, where he remained a close prisoner until the fall of the\r\nImperial Government; but this captivity did not prevent the Cortes\r\nfrom appointing him a Counsellor of State when naming the regency.\r\nThe triumph of the allies having broken his fetters in 1814, after\r\nreceiving many marks of favour from the Emperor Alexander, he returned\r\ninto Spain under the ministry of Ballasteros, and was appointed\r\nDirector-General of the Corps of Engineers. He occupied this honourable\r\npost until the revolution of 1820, when, in exchange, he received a\r\nseat in the Council of State. When war was threatened between France\r\nand Spain in 1823 he was appointed, on the 7th February, one of the\r\ncommittee of five generals who were ordered to concert measures for\r\ndefending the kingdom. In the French army which entered Spain in\r\nthat year, under the Marquis of Lauriston (an officer of _Scottish_\r\nparentage), we find two lieutenant-generals of _Irish_ descent--Count\r\nBourke and Viscount O'Donoughue; the Duke of Angoulême was\r\nGeneral-in-Chief, and to him, the Duke of Berwick and Alba, a Spanish\r\ngrandee of the Stuart blood, gave his adherence. The restoration\r\ncaused by the French intervention under the Marshal Lauriston was\r\nfatal to Blake; for being suspected by the royalists of constitutional\r\nprinciples, he was only able to avoid prosecution by great care and\r\nsolicitude: but his career was drawing to a close, as he died at\r\nValladolid in 1827, regretted by all the Spanish army, and eulogized by\r\nthe people in their songs and stories of \"the War of Independence.\"\r\n\r\nThe military men who had borne arms under him, says a French writer,\r\nrecognised and admitted his positive talent, his great knowledge and\r\nperspicacité of tactiques; but agreed that he failed in two essential\r\npoints--the prompt _coup d'oeil_ which decides at once the fortune of a\r\nbattle, and that art of manner by which it is necessary to excite the\r\nenthusiasm of the soldier.\r\n\r\nA distinguished branch of the old Celtic sept of O'Donnel has borne a\r\nprominent part in the Spanish annals during the last fifty years; but\r\nso early as the days of Philip of Anjou and Charles of Spain, we find\r\nan O'Donnel fighting in the ranks of their armies.\r\n\r\nSoon after the accession of James VI. to the English throne, he was\r\nengaged in the last struggle of the Crown against the houses of\r\nO'Donnel and O'Neil. An earldom was bestowed as a peace-offering upon\r\nthe chief of the former; but his plots against the king soon deprived\r\nhim of it: his estates were seized, an English colony planted in the\r\nland of his tribe, and he fled to the Court of Spain, between which\r\nand the Irish there had been a close connexion during the animosity of\r\nPhilip II. and Elizabeth. He was welcomed with all the honours of a\r\nCastilian grandee, and attained a high rank under King Charles. Eighty\r\nyears after this we find his descendant, Baldearg O'Donnel, still\r\nremembering the days when the chiefs, or petty princes of his race,\r\nwere solemnly inaugurated as the successors of St. Columba on the Rock\r\nof Kilmacrenan. He resigned his commission in the service of Philip V.,\r\nof whom he begged permission to join the Irish, then in arms against\r\nWilliam of Orange. Philip refused; but the O'Donnel fled by a route so\r\ncircuitous that he visited Turkey, and after enduring many privations,\r\nlanded at Kinsale in 1690, where seven thousand armed Ulster-men hailed\r\nhim with joy, as the _Red O'Donnel_ of an ancient Celtic prophecy.\r\n\r\nFrom Baldearg O'Donnel is descended General Count O'Donnel, who\r\ncommanded the army of Maria Theresa on the fall of Count Lacy at\r\nthe great battle of Toorgau in 1761; and also General O'Donnel,\r\nVice-Governor of Lombardy, who was attacked by the Milanese during the\r\nAustrian revolution of 1848, when his palace was stormed and himself\r\ntaken prisoner. There was also a Count O'Donnel in the Hungarian\r\nservice, who died at Brussels in 1767, after reaching the patriarchal\r\nage of one hundred and two years.\r\n\r\nOf this ancient Celtic family there are now, or were lately, four\r\ngeneral officers of the highest rank in the service of Great Britain,\r\nSpain, Austria, and America; but of these the most distinguished is\r\nLeopold O'Donnel, Conde de Lucena and Marshal in the service of Donna\r\nIsabella II.\r\n\r\nThe four O'Donnels, Henry, Charles, Joseph, and Alexander, who attained\r\nsuch distinction in Spain during the Peninsula War, were the sons of\r\nIrish gentlemen who emigrated to that country during the latter end of\r\nthe last century; and of their services and honours our limits will\r\nallow but a brief outline; while General Sarsfield, Colonel O'Ronan,\r\nA.D.C. to the Marquis de Campo Verde, or such partisan soldiers as\r\nMacDonel, the unfortunate Guerilla chief who fell in action, Captain\r\nFlinter the Christino, or General O'Doyle and his brother, a captain,\r\nwho were taken prisoners at the last battle of Vittoria, and shot in\r\ncold blood by Zumalacarregui, can only be indicated here by name.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES (afterwards) Count O'Donnel first became known to history in\r\n1810, when commanding at Albuquerque, from whence, on the 14th March,\r\nhe made a vigorous attempt to surprise General Foy, but was driven into\r\nCasceres. Marching towards the ancient city of Merida on the 2nd April,\r\nhe drove back General Regnier and made an attempt to surprise Truxillo\r\n(the birthplace of Pizarro), which is situated on a mountain. Here he\r\nwas repulsed, and with difficulty effected a retreat to Albuquerque;\r\nbut three months after we find him at Truxillo again, co-operating with\r\nDon Carlos de España, with whom he cut off the French at Rio Monte.\r\nIn May he had lent two thousand infantry and two hundred cannoneers\r\nto Blake, to enable that officer to conduct the siege of Tarragona,\r\nreceiving in return from Captain Codrington two thousand British\r\nmuskets to equip a new levy. He allowed four thousand of his best\r\nValencians to embark with Miranda to fight at Tarragona, but not until\r\nhe received a pledge that the British would bring back all who survived\r\nthe siege.\r\n\r\nCharles served long with Blake, and was in most of the battles just\r\nrecounted; thus, to rehearse his earlier services would be to enumerate\r\nthose of Blake a second time.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1811, when the latter was forced to retire beyond the\r\nGuadalaviar, he left Charles O'Donnel with four thousand men on the\r\nside of Segorbe; and on investing Saguntum in October, he sent him with\r\nVilla Campo's division and San Juan's cavalry to Betera. There O'Donnel\r\nwas attacked by Harispe, though well posted in rear of a canal, and\r\nhaving his centre protected by a chapel and some houses; but the French\r\nadvanced with such fury, that the Spaniards were swept away by the\r\nfirst fire.\r\n\r\nIn the war of 1823, General O'Donnel commanded a corps of Royalists,\r\nwhich were destroyed by the troops of Torrijos, the Constitutionalist;\r\nand soon after, his wife, the Condesa de O'Donnel, had a narrow escape\r\nfrom a party of the Empecinado, who were sent to Valladolid to take\r\nher prisoner, but were repulsed by the troops of the Marshal Duke of\r\nReggio.\r\n\r\nCharles O'Donnel was now Captain-General of Old Castile, and as such,\r\nin the month of August, he summoned and took from its insurgent\r\ngarrison, under General Jalon, the citadel of Ciudad Rodrigo. By\r\nthe convention between them, it appears that the governor of the\r\nfortress undertook to obey any orders he might receive direct from\r\nthe king; but displayed great distrust of the royalists and the Irish\r\ncommander. After this, the latter marched into Estremadura, everywhere\r\ncrushing the Constitutionalists, and enforcing the supremacy of the\r\nking. In August his head-quarters were at Salamanca, and in October\r\nat Algesiras. This war, in which the absolute power of Ferdinand was\r\nfatally enforced by the bayonets of France under Marshal Lauriston,\r\nthe Duke of Reggio, and others, soon ended; but though smothered for a\r\ntime, the restless spirit of the Spaniards soon again broke forth into\r\na flame, and most fatally for the house of O'Donnel, as shall be shown\r\nin the sequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH O'DONNEL, who had been serving with his brothers against the\r\ncommon enemy, was appointed by the regent, the Conde de Abispal, to\r\nsucceed Blake in command of the Murcians and Valencians in May, 1812.\r\nHe collected the remains of these two armies, remodelled them with\r\ngreat energy, raised new levies, and during the illness of Marshal\r\nSuchet mustered fourteen thousand men in the neighbourhood of Alicant.\r\n\r\nThese operations, with others in Catalonia, brought on the battle of\r\nCastalla in July, when, with 6000 foot, 700 horse, and eight guns, he\r\nfought General Harispe on the mountains; but on the rough pathway and\r\na narrow bridge near Biar, the Spanish infantry were borne down by\r\nthe weight and fury of the French cuirassiers, and forced to retreat,\r\nleaving 3000 slain on the field. O'Donnel, who had made incredible\r\nexertions to gain the day, and had fired two pieces of cannon at the\r\nbridge with his own hands, attributed his defeat to the disobedience\r\nand inability of San Estevan, who commanded his cavalry, and who, by\r\nholding that force aloof, took no share in the battle. Pursued by the\r\nFrench cuirassiers, Joseph fled by the Jumella road, and reached the\r\ncity of Murcia, where he was joined by General Maitland's armament from\r\nSicily, and thus saved from destruction; but he unwisely required that\r\nofficer to abstain from all requisitions for forage and rations from\r\nthe neighbouring country. Maitland assented, and immediately sank under\r\nthe unnecessary difficulties thus created. In August, when O'Donnel was\r\nat Yecla with 6000 men, the Cortes passed a severe censure upon him\r\nfor his conduct at the battle of Castalla; so severe, indeed, that his\r\nbrother, the Conde de Abispal, a proud and haughty soldier, resigned\r\nhis high command during the campaign, which ended in Wellington's\r\nretreat from Burgos; and then the weakness of the Spanish Government\r\nbecame more than ever apparent.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December, when at Malaga, Joseph wrote a long letter\r\nto General Donkin, concerning the _malheur_ at Castalla, in which\r\nwe find his knowledge of English so imperfect that he was obliged,\r\nafter a dozen of lines, to adopt and end it in French; and after this\r\nunfortunate defeat we hear no more of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER O'DONNEL, the third brother, was colonel of a regiment of\r\nSpanish infantry, and served with it in the Danish Isles under Romana.\r\nAttacked there by overwhelming numbers, they effected their escape in\r\n1808; but on being made captives at Espinosa, they entered the French\r\nranks to the number of 4500, and served in Napoleon's Continental war,\r\nuntil they were all taken prisoners by the Russians on the retreat from\r\nMoscow, when they were brought back to Spain in British ships, under\r\nthe care of Captain Hill of the Royal Navy. One of the Spanish corps\r\nwhich returned after this strange career of military service was the\r\nregiment of Don Alexander O'Donnel, which had been fully equipped by\r\nthe Emperor Alexander in 1812, and for which the daughter of General\r\nBetancourt embroidered a pair of colours. It was styled the _Imperial\r\nAlexander Regiment_, and under O'Donnel distinguished itself in the\r\nnational cause till after the disasters of 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY O'DONNEL, Conde de Abispal, who, like his brother, had been\r\nserving with success and distinction in the battles of the Peninsula,\r\nwas a brave, reckless, and determined soldier, possessed of military\r\ntalents of a very high order, together with a heedlessness of his own\r\nlife and of the lives of others. Passing, with honour to himself,\r\nthrough all the subaltern ranks, he was a colonel of Spanish infantry\r\nin 1809, when Blake ordered him to command in the attack upon Sauham's\r\nposts near Brunola, where, on the 31st August, he had the mortification\r\nof seeing the place retaken, after he had carried it at the point of\r\nthe bayonet.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th September, as related in the memoir of Blake, he led the\r\nadvanced guard in the brilliant attempt to relieve Gerona. On the\r\n13th October he broke out of the city, sword in hand, hewed a passage\r\nthrough the French blockade, and, falling on Sauham's quarters sabre\r\n_à la main_, forced that general to fly in his shirt, and successfully\r\nachieved one of the most daring enterprises of that memorable siege.\r\nIn 1810, on succeeding Blake in command of the Catalonians--an\r\nappointment bestowed by the provincial Junta, who heard of his high\r\nreputation--he attacked Marshal Augereau with great fury, and drove\r\nhim into Gerona. He took up a position at Vich, but on the approach\r\nof the French retired to the Col de Sespina, where he led a charge so\r\nfierce and decisive, that Sauham's battalions were hurled from the\r\nhills in confusion upon the plain. Marching to Manresa, he summoned the\r\nMiguelets from Lerida to his colours. These were a species of banditti\r\nwho infested the mountains, and were armed with pistols, daggers, and\r\nblunderbusses. With 12,000 men, Henry O'Donnel took up a position at\r\nMaya in February, and harassed the French before Vich, where he fought\r\nand lost a severe battle, and was forced to retreat to the Sierras,\r\nand from thence to Tarragona, leaving a fourth of his men dead on the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nO'Donnel, \"whose energy and military talents,\" says Napier, \"were\r\nsuperior to all his predecessors,\" now sent Caro with 6000 men against\r\nthe French at Villa Franca, where unfortunately they were all killed or\r\ncaptured; and being wounded, he was compelled for a time to resign the\r\ncommand to General Gasca.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th April, he harassed the French, then retreating from\r\nTarragona towards Barcelona; and after retiring from Vich with an army\r\ndiscomfited by only 5000 Frenchmen, with the same discomfited men\r\nhe baffled Augereau, who led 20,000 bayonets; forced him to abandon\r\nLower Catalonia, and to retreat in disgrace to Gerona, where Marshal\r\nMacdonald, a Scotsman, was sent by Napoleon to succeed him. During the\r\ninvestment of Hostalric by the French, Henry O'Donnel collected many\r\nconvoys for its relief; he attacked the blockade at several points\r\nwith the Miguelets, and particularly distinguished himself in a noble\r\nand dashing attempt to relieve the brave Julian Estrada, on the night\r\nof the 12th May, when this strong citadel fell. During the siege of\r\nLerida by Suchet, O'Donnel collected two divisions of 4000 each; with\r\nthese and 600 cavalry he skilfully passed the defile of Momblanch, and\r\nfought the contest of Margalef, where his troops were defeated; but he\r\nrallied, and led them again upon the columns of the Duc d'Albufera.\r\nThe struggle was terrible; but he was forced to retreat through the\r\npasses, leaving one general, eight colonels, 5000 men, and three guns\r\nin the hands of the foe. His force was now 1400 strong, well supplied\r\nby the active Miguelets; and by the bravery of his soldiers and his own\r\nunwearying zeal he long prevented the siege of Tortoza, and found full\r\nemployment for the enemy during the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\n\"After the battle of Margalef, Henry O'Donnel re-united his forces,\r\nand being of a stern, unyielding disposition, not only repressed the\r\ndiscontents occasioned by that defeat, but forced the reluctant (and\r\nlawless) Miguelets to supply his ranks and submit to discipline.\"\r\nThus, in July he had twenty-two thousand men when Marshals Macdonald\r\nand Suchet combined to crush him, and when Napoleon's order to invest\r\nTortoza arrived. On this O'Donnel, after making a skilful feint towards\r\nTrivisa, suddenly threw himself with ten thousand men into the fated\r\ncity, from whence, upon the noon of the 3rd July, he fell furiously\r\nupon the French entrenchments, and made a fearful slaughter of the\r\ntroops of Laval. After this he retired to Tarragona. Having cut off\r\nMacdonald's communication with the walled city of Ampurias, he now\r\nconceived and executed the most skilful and vigorous plan which had yet\r\ngraced the Spanish arms.\r\n\r\nLeaving Campo Verde in the valley of Aro, on the 14th, he marched\r\nrapidly down from Casa de Silva upon Abispal, where the French, under\r\nSwartz, were entrenched. He attacked them, slew two hundred, and,\r\ntaking the rest, embarked them for Tarragona, whither he retired soon\r\nafter, to take a little repose, being troubled by his last wound; yet\r\nin January, 1811, we find him again in arms, directing the movements of\r\nthe army, and harassing Marshals Macdonald and Suchet, though unable to\r\nride or appear in the field; and on his being created Conde de Abispal,\r\nhe resigned the command of his Catalonians, three thousand in number,\r\nto Campo Verde, being so disabled by wounds that he was quite unable to\r\nconduct the siege of Tortoza.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1812, he was appointed to that situation, which several\r\nIrish soldiers of fortune have held--Captain-General of Andalusia,--and\r\non Wellington reaching Cadiz in December of that year, after the\r\nretreat from Burgos, on his making a complete re-organization of the\r\nSpanish forces, the first reserve corps was given to the Conde de\r\nAbispal, and the second reserve to Lacy. Thus they both served in the\r\nnew campaign which ended so gloriously on the field of Vittoria. After\r\nthis signal victory, the task of reducing the forts near the tremendous\r\npass of Pancorbo, which secured the approach to the Ebro, was given to\r\nthe Irish Conde and his Andalusians, to whom they fell partly by storm\r\nand partly by capitulation.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th July, 1813, to O'Donnel and his reserve of five thousand\r\nwas permanently entrusted the important duty of blocking up the\r\nFrench garrison in Pampeluna, now almost the last stronghold of\r\nNapoleon in Spain. This task he conducted with great vigour, while\r\nWellington secured the passes of the Pyrenees and pushed the siege of\r\nSan Sebastian; but on Soult forcing the passes on the 25th July, such\r\nan alarm reached Pampeluna, that the Conde de Abispal spiked some of\r\nhis cannon, blew up his magazines, abandoned the trenches, and but\r\nfor Picton's victorious stand at Huarte, was prepared to retreat. On\r\nthe fortunate arrival of a small Spanish division under Don Carlos\r\nd'Espana, the blockade was resumed and the siege pressed with renewed\r\nvigour.\r\n\r\nO'Donnel was posted on the right of Marshal Murillo at the great and\r\ndecisive battle of Pampeluna, so absurdly and obstinately styled by the\r\nBritish _the battle of the Pyrenees_, from which it is nearly thirty\r\nmiles distant. Soult was completely overthrown, and in August O'Donnel\r\nreinforced the seventh division in occupying the important passes of\r\nExhallar and Zugaramurdi. After this, being again troubled by old\r\nwounds, he fell ill and resigned his command for a time to Giron. In\r\nNovember he resumed it again, and occupied the beautiful valley of the\r\nBastan, prior to the invasion of France under Wellington.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1814, he led six thousand men at the passage of the Gaves,\r\nand was engaged in all the operations on the Lower Pyrenees with the\r\nSpaniards under the Prince of Anglona. He served in that victorious\r\ncampaign which terminated at the blood-stained hill of Toulouse, where,\r\nas General Napier so pithily remarks, \"the war terminated, _and with it\r\nall remembrance of the veterans' services_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Constitutional war which ensued in Spain nine years after, and\r\nduring the invasion of that country by monarchical France in 1823, the\r\nO'Donnels bore a prominent part, and adhered to Ferdinand VII. The\r\nConde de Abispal was appointed a field-marshal, with the office of\r\ngovernor and political chief at Madrid, and on the 25th March he issued\r\na proclamation announcing that the amnesty granted by the Cortes to\r\nthose in arms against the king was about to expire, and concluded by\r\na brief warning to the factious and the Constitutionalists to lay\r\ndown their arms. On the 17th April he published his able orders and\r\npropositions to the militia of the capital, together with the following\r\ndeclaration of his political principles:--\r\n\r\n \"_Don Henry O'Donnel, Knight Grand Cross, &c., General\r\n of the 3rd Corps, &c._\r\n\r\n \"Having learned that some ill-disposed persons have confounded my\r\n _private opinion_ with those sacred obligations _which my oath and\r\n duty impose upon me_, and have given out that I am unwilling to\r\n support the Constitution of 1812 even to the last extremity, and until\r\n the national representation, lawfully constituted, should have made\r\n certain changes therein; I do declare that _I am resolved to defend\r\n it_, according to my oath, until it shall be altered by those means\r\n which the Constitution itself prescribes, and that I deem as traitors\r\n all Spaniards who, deviating from the path of duty traced out by law,\r\n shall cease to obey the same. Such were my sentiments when, in answer\r\n to an address from M. Montijo, I wrote a letter which they charge me\r\n with having published, and such will ever be my sentiments. But my\r\n _opinion_ as an individual shall never prevent me from fulfilling my\r\n _duty_ as a general and a citizen of Spain.\r\n\r\n \"Madrid, 17th May, 1823.\"\r\n\r\nBut ere long he found the difficulty of reconciling his private\r\nsentiments and conviction with his duty to a king who had become the\r\ntool of France. Abispal proved the Talleyrand of Spain, and lost all\r\nfavour by his indecision and vacillation; for, after receiving the\r\nGrand Cordon of the Order of Carlos III. from the hands of Ferdinand\r\nVII., he passed over to the Constitutionalists. From that day his power\r\ndeclined, and he was glad to seek shelter from the fury and clamour of\r\nthe people at Montpelier in France, where he lived in retirement and\r\nmuch reduced in circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis son, LEOPOLD COUNT O'DONNEL, remained in Spain, and had attained\r\nthe rank of colonel when the civil war broke out between the Carlists\r\nand Christinos, a step in which the children of the four elder\r\nO'Donnels were strangely divided, brother against brother, and cousin\r\nagainst cousin.\r\n\r\nThus, on the 2nd May, 1835, when Quesada was attacked by Don Tomas\r\nZumalacarregui (the Claverhouse of Spanish loyalty), his division\r\nwould have been annihilated but for the timely succour he received\r\nfrom Colonel Leopold O'Donnel de Abispal, who unfortunately was\r\ntaken prisoner by the Navarrese while vainly struggling to rally the\r\nLoyal Guards. All who were captured were barbarously shot by the\r\nCarlists, and of all who perished none was more regretted than the\r\nyoung, handsome, and chivalric O'Donnel. Though a colonel in the\r\nservice, he was merely accompanying Quesada to profit by his escort\r\nso far as Pampeluna, where he was about to celebrate his nuptials\r\nwith a beautiful Spanish girl of high rank, and the heiress of an old\r\nand wealthy family. A noble ransom was offered, but Don Tomas was\r\ninexorable.\r\n\r\nHis father, Henry O'Donnel, then in his old age, died of a broken heart\r\nat Montpelier, on hearing of his son's disastrous fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL JOHN O'DONNEL (a cousin of Leopold's) commanded the 2nd\r\nregiment of Castilian infantry, while his brother Charles led the\r\ninsurgent cavalry of Don Tomas, and at the head of his own corps,\r\nthe heavily-armed and ferocious lancers of Navarre, performed in his\r\ntwenty-fifth year the most brilliant feats of the Constitutional war.\r\nFor his romantic victory over Lopez, in fair battle on one of the\r\nimmense plains of Old Castile, he was made Knight of San Ferdinando.\r\nSoon after, he was mortally wounded in action near Pampeluna, and as he\r\nexpired in agony, he exclaimed: \"I wish some one would send a bullet\r\nthrough me and end this misery!--I have but a short time to live.\r\nAlready four O'Donnels have perished in this war; and their blood has\r\nbeen shed on the right side as well as on the wrong!\"\r\n\r\nHe referred to Leopold, who was shot in cold blood at Alsassua; to\r\nhis second brother, who lost a leg at Arguijas, and died under the\r\namputation; to Charles, who lay on a bed of sickness from which he\r\nnever rose; and to John, who was wounded in battle at Mendigorra; and\r\nbeing dragged from bed by a mob at Barcelona, was cruelly murdered in\r\nthe streets and literally cut _into ounce pieces_. He and Charles left\r\nwives and children in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEOPOLD, the Conde de Lucena, and his brother Colonel HENRY O'DONNEL,\r\nwho in the Spanish affairs of the present time have borne so prominent\r\na part, are of the same warlike stock; but their adventures are too\r\nrecent to require a record here.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The reader will remember the mistake of Donna Julia,--\r\n\r\n \"Was it for this that General Count O'Reilly,\r\n Who _took Algiers_, declares I used him vilely?\"\r\n\r\n _Don Juan_, Canto i.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHAL BARON LOUDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the summit of a rising ground, by the side of a brook in the parish\r\nof Loudon in Ayrshire, stand the ruins of the ancient Castle of Loudon,\r\nwhich was destroyed about three hundred and fifty years ago by the\r\nclan Kennedy, headed by their chief, the Earl of Cassilis. This old\r\nScottish stronghold was the seat of a family from which sprung Gideon\r\nErnest Baron Loudon, or _de Laudohn_, a distinguished general of the\r\nContinental wars.\r\n\r\nLoudon of that ilk was one of the oldest families in the kingdom of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nLambin was proprietor of the lands and barony of Loudon during the\r\nreign of David I., who succeeded to the throne in 1124. James of\r\nLoudon, _dominus de eodem_, or of that ilk, obtained a charter of the\r\nsame barony from Richard de Morville, Constable of the Kingdom; _Jacobo\r\nfilio Lambin_, &c., also obtained a charter from William de Morville,\r\nas _Jacobo de Loudon, terrarum baroniæ de Loudon_. Both these documents\r\nwere granted during the reign of William the Lion, who succeeded to the\r\nthrone in 1165, and are, says Sir Robert Douglas, a proof that he took\r\nhis sirname from these lands, according to the custom of those early\r\ntimes; and his armorial bearings were, argent, three escutcheons sable.\r\nHis daughter, Margaret of Loudon, was married to Sir Reginald Crawford,\r\nHigh Sheriff of Ayr, and became the grandmother of Sir William Wallace,\r\nthe heroic defender of the liberties of his country.\r\n\r\nIn later times, a branch of this old family had left\r\n\r\n \"Loudon's bonnie woods and braes,\"\r\n\r\nso famed in Scottish song, and settled in Livonia, where their bravery\r\nand services had won them several fiefs and baronies, of which,\r\nhowever, they were dispossessed by Charles XI. of Sweden, after the\r\npeace of Oliva, when the Polish Republic gave up its right to the old\r\nTeutonic province.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of his successor, the famous Charles XII., the\r\nLivonian nobles made a vigorous effort to regain their patrimonies\r\nand privileges; but the Swedish king having put to death their\r\nrepresentative, the celebrated general, John Raynold Patkul, an officer\r\nin the service of Augustus, King of Poland, by cruelly breaking him\r\nalive upon the wheel, where he received sixteen blows, enduring the\r\nlongest and greatest tortures that can be conceived, all hope of\r\nrestoring Livonian liberty died; and with many other noble families,\r\nthe Loudons dedicated themselves to the profession of arms: one became\r\na captain in the Royal Swedish Guards, and was uncle of the subject of\r\nthis memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIDEON ERNEST LOUDON was born at Tootzen, in Livonia, in the year 1716.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the war and troubles in which his native province\r\nwas involved, his education was much neglected; and though his great\r\nmilitary genius in after years enabled him in some degree to supply\r\nthe deficiency, he never ceased to regret the loss he had sustained,\r\nby those circumstances over which he had no control, but which,\r\nfortunately for himself, forced him to earn his bread by his sword as\r\na soldier of fortune. He had learned little more than to read and to\r\nwrite, with a smattering of geography and geometry, when in 1731 he\r\nentered the Russian service as a cadet.\r\n\r\nHe was then in his fifteenth year, and Anne, daughter of Ivan II.,\r\nniece of Peter the Great, and consort of the Duke of Courland, was\r\nCzarina of Russia. The corps to which young Loudon was attached was a\r\nbattalion of infantry; and after being two years in garrison with it,\r\nan opportunity was afforded him of making an essay in arms, when the\r\nwar of the Double Election created disturbances in northern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1733 Stanislaus Leczinski, whom Charles XII. had invested with the\r\nSovereignty of Poland in 1704, and whom Peter the Great had dethroned,\r\nwas chosen king a second time on his daughter being married to Louis\r\nXV., from whom he received a paltry succour, consisting of only four\r\nbattalions of infantry; but the Austrian Emperor, on being assisted by\r\nthe Russians, compelled the Poles to make _another_ selection, and the\r\nElector of Saxony was raised to their throne by the name of Augustus\r\nIII., while poor King Stanislaus was driven into Dantzig, where the\r\nRussians followed and besieged him.\r\n\r\nLoudon's regiment served with the blockading force, at the investment\r\nof this populous city, which is the capital of Western Prussia, and\r\nat that time had a population of two hundred thousand. Loudon was\r\npresent during the siege and capture of Dantzig, from which, however,\r\nthe ex-King of Poland made an escape, and renounced for ever the poor\r\ndistinction of being monarch of a republic plunged in anarchy.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1734, his regiment formed part of the army which was sent\r\nby the Empress Anne towards the Low Countries, and spread a terror\r\nalong the frontier of Germany. In this campaign he marched from\r\nthe banks of the Wolga to those of the Rhine. A peace being signed\r\nat Vienna, the forces marched to the Dnieper, the scene of so many\r\nsanguinary encounters between the Russ and Turk. This movement was\r\nto repel the Osmanlies and punish the Tartars of the Crimea, who had\r\nmade an irruption into the southern province of Russia, and committed\r\nunparalleled outrages.\r\n\r\nIn the army under Marshal the Count de Munich, young Loudon served in\r\nthe long campaign from 1736 to 1739, and was present in that barbarous\r\nwarfare in the Crimea, which is already detailed in the memoirs\r\nof the Counts Lacy and Brown, including the capture of Azoph; the\r\nstorming of the lines at Perecop; the assault and capture of Oczackow,\r\nStaveoctochane and Choczim, with the general ravage and subjugation of\r\nthe Tartar peninsula down to the extreme verge of the Tauric range, and\r\nto the Symbolorum Portus of Strabo--the harbour of Balaclava.\r\n\r\nIn his position, which was then so subordinate, the share borne by\r\nLoudon in those brilliant operations was necessarily obscure; but, for\r\nhis ability and attention to duty, he was soon raised from the rank\r\nof cadet to the commissions of a second, and then first lieutenant;\r\na proof that the germ of an able officer had been discerned by his\r\ncolonel in the foreign volunteer. The treaty which ceded Azoph to\r\nRussia in 1739 secured a brief peace to Europe, and the Empress Anne\r\nIvanowna began to disband her unwieldly forces.\r\n\r\nOn this occurring, Lieutenant Loudon repaired to St. Petersburg in\r\n1740, for the double purpose of complaining to the Empress that he\r\nhad been unjustly treated during the war, having served nine years\r\nand being still a subaltern; and also to solicit from her further\r\nemployment and promotion. Disappointed in both these objects, he\r\nresigned his commission in her service with disgust, and quitted the\r\nRussian capital, resolving to make an offer of his sword to the Empress\r\nQueen of Hungary, Maria Theresa, who had succeeded her father Charles\r\nVI. on the Austrian throne, and found it assailed on all sides by\r\nhostile armies.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through Berlin he fell in with several officers,\r\nprincipally Scots and Irishmen, with whom he had served under Marshal\r\nMunich in the late campaigns; and some of these recommended him to\r\njoin the Prussian service, in which they had all accepted commissions;\r\nand one was kind enough to offer him an introduction to the warlike\r\nFrederick II., with whom, after some weeks' delay, he had the honour\r\nof an interview. Loudon modestly stated his nine years' service, his\r\njunior rank and wishes, adding that, as he had held a lieutenantcy\r\nunder the Empress Anne, he ventured to hope that his Majesty would\r\nbestow upon him the command of a company. Frederick keenly scrutinized\r\nhis face, which \"was serious, cold, severe, reserved, pensive, and\r\nreflecting\" (for he was a man schooled in danger and adversity), and it\r\ndid not prepossess the royal martinet of Prussia in his favour, for he\r\nhad the rudeness to turn his back upon the military stranger, and say\r\nto some officers near him,--\r\n\r\n\"_The physiognomy of this man does not please me._\"\r\n\r\nIn anger and mortification young Loudon, then in his twenty-fourth\r\nyear, quitted his presence with a swelling heart; but he could not then\r\nforesee the time when he would become the most formidable enemy that\r\never met the Prussian monarch in the field.\r\n\r\nIn very poor circumstances he reached Vienna in 1742, and being\r\nfurnished with a strong recommendatory letter from the Austrian\r\nambassador, repaired to the Imperial palace in search of military\r\nemployment. While he was lingering unknown and unnoticed in the\r\nante-chamber, a gentleman accosted him, inquiring his name and\r\nbusiness. Loudon having mentioned both, and expressed great desire\r\nto see the Empress, this person said, \"I will do all in my power to\r\nassist you, sir,\" and passed directly _into_ the cabinet. In a few\r\nminutes \"Lieutenant Loudon\" was summoned by name, and on entering,\r\nwas astonished to discover in his unknown protector the husband of\r\nthe beautiful Maria Theresa, Francis Stephen, Grand Duke of Tuscany\r\nand First Emperor of the House of Lorraine-Austria! Under auspices so\r\nfavourable, his request was at once granted, and he obtained a company\r\nin the Free Corps of Pandours raised by Baron Trenck, who had known\r\nLoudon in Russia, and was well pleased to have under him so gallant an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThese Pandours were Sclavonians from the banks of the Drave, a river\r\nof Germany which rises in the Tyrol and empties itself into the Danube\r\nnear Effeck in Hungary. This regiment, which was raised chiefly in\r\nthe village of Pandour or Szent Istevan, wore long coats girt by a\r\nwaist-belt, in which each man carried a sabre, four or five pistols,\r\nand a poniard. On service they always acted as irregular cavalry. This\r\ncorps had originally been infantry, and were styled the Regiment of\r\nRuitza. Their chief occupation had been to clear the roads of brigands\r\nand freebooters; and though the biographer of Baron Trenck endeavours\r\nto conceal the fact, history proves that in their new organization the\r\nPandours were a mere military banditti, whose pay was plunder, and\r\nwhose duty was devastation.\r\n\r\nLittle as he must have liked the service, Captain Loudon commenced a\r\ncampaign in their ranks, in the war which ensued on Louis XV. and the\r\nKing of Prussia leaguing together for the partition of the Austrian\r\nEmpire. A French army under the Marshal Dukes de Belleisle and de\r\nBroglie, entered Germany, where the Bavarian Elector formed a junction\r\nwith them; reduced Lintz, the capital of Upper Austria, and threatened\r\nVienna. Kevenhüller recovered Lintz; the battle of Czaslau, in which\r\nthe Pandours and Croats charged with such effect and fury was fought;\r\nPrague was besieged, and all northern Europe found itself engaged in a\r\ngeneral strife.\r\n\r\nAt the head of his Pandours Baron Trenck acted the part of a bold\r\npartisan. He stormed the Isle of Rheinmarck, put its garrison to\r\nthe sword, and with his own sabre slew the commandant, the Comte de\r\nCreveceur. Mentzel with four thousand Croats and Pandours broke into\r\nLorraine and Luxembourg, where they committed terrible devastations.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, when Prince Charles of Lorraine forced his famous passage over\r\nthe Rhine, Gideon Loudon led his company in the _foremost_ boat, and\r\nwas the _first_ who landed on French ground; but in a skirmish with\r\nthe advanced picquets of the French near Zabern, a city built on the\r\nsummit of a rock, and defended by a strong castle of the Bishops of\r\nStrasburg, he was struck by a musket-ball when fighting bravely at the\r\nhead of his men. It entered his right breast and came out behind near\r\nthe shoulder-blade, and thus incapacitated him for farther service for\r\nsome time. He fell--was taken prisoner, and conveyed to a neighbouring\r\ncottage. A few days afterwards the Austrian army advanced; the\r\nPandours drove the enemy; Loudon was restored to liberty, and had the\r\nsatisfaction of saving from pillage the dwelling of the peasant with\r\nwhom he had found shelter and by whom he had been benevolently treated.\r\n\r\nMeantime the King of Prussia, sick of his bloody victories, signed the\r\ntreaty of Breslau, which filled France with consternation, and forced\r\nher marshals, Belleisle and Broglie, to retire towards Prague; but the\r\nclose of 1745 saw tranquillity restored to Germany for a time.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the reckless regiment of Trenck, Loudon quitted it and\r\nreturned to Vienna, where he resigned his commission and was preparing\r\nto leave the Austrian dominions in search of fortune elsewhere, when\r\nsome of his military friends advised him to remain, and procured for\r\nhim a majority in the regiment of Liccaner, which at that time was\r\ngarrisoning a town on the Croatian frontier. His old corps the Pandours\r\nwere disbanded, but were afterwards re-organized in 1750 as regular\r\ntroops, and became of great service in the war of 1756, and in those of\r\nthe first French Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis new appointment and its emoluments enabled him to espouse Clara\r\nde Hagen, the daughter of a brave Hungarian officer who resided at\r\nPæsing. He was sincerely attached to this lady, and they had one child,\r\na daughter, who died in infancy.\r\n\r\nDuring ten years that he remained in the garrison towns of Croatia\r\nhe spent all his leisure hours in perfecting his military education,\r\nand completing the study of fortification, geography, and geometry.\r\nHe procured a vast number of maps and plans of fortified places,\r\nsuch as castles and barrier towns; and, as if he had some intuitive\r\npresentiment of the part he was yet to perform in the great game of\r\nwar, he pored over them incessantly. Having once obtained a German map\r\nof unusual size, he spread it over the floor of his barrack-room, and\r\n_sat down_ upon it, to pursue his study of it with greater ease, and\r\nwas thus occupied when Madame Loudon entered.\r\n\r\n\"My dear major,\" said she, \"still as ever, occupied by these horrid\r\nplans and perpetual studies!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind my present labours,\" said he, cheerfully; \"they will be\r\nof great service to me, my dear Clara, when I obtain the bâton of a\r\nfield-marshal.\"\r\n\r\nMadame Loudon laughed, for her husband was then eight-and-thirty, and\r\nthe bâton of a marshal seemed yet to be a long way off.\r\n\r\nIn 1756 the Seven Years' War was threatened. A league was formed by\r\nthe Court of Vienna for stripping the King of Prussia of his dominions.\r\nThe French threatened the electorate of Hanover, and formed an alliance\r\nwith Sweden and Austria against Britain and Prussia, the king of which,\r\non receiving evasive answers from Vienna as to the object of the\r\nAustrian armaments, prepared for immediate strife.\r\n\r\nAnxious for employment, and remembering, perhaps, the manner in which\r\nFrederick II. had insulted him at his levée in Berlin, the enterprising\r\nspirit of Loudon induced him to visit Vienna and solicit a command\r\nagainst Prussia; but having left his regiment without obtaining leave\r\nof absence, he was on the point of being reprimanded and ordered\r\nback to Croatia, when by good fortune he obtained the friendship\r\nand patronage of Prince Kaunitz, the head of a noble family, whose\r\npossessions lie on the Iglau in Moravia. By the prince's interest\r\nhe was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of eight hundred Croats. These\r\nwild and hardy troops were destined to be ordered on every desperate\r\nservice, and as their mode of fighting resembled in every respect\r\nthat of the Pandours, Loudon was well fitted to command them; more\r\nespecially as he had acquired their dialect while quartered in their\r\nnative province. They were all clad in short waistcoats with sleeves,\r\nlong white breeches, light boots, and rough huzzar caps. They had\r\neach a long firelock with a rifle barrel and short bayonet, a crooked\r\nsabre, and brace of pistols. This corps formed part of five thousand\r\nCroats levied by the Empress-Queen for the new war against Prussia.\r\nLike the Pandours of Baron Trenck, they had no pay or provisions, but\r\nsuch as their swords and the terror of their presence won them; and as\r\nirregular troops they were a scourge wherever they marched.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August, 1756, the King of Prussia entered Saxony at\r\nthe head of seventy battalions of foot and eighty squadrons of horse,\r\nin three columns, which marched by three different routes, but formed\r\na junction at Dresden and captured it. The Elector, who was King of\r\nPoland by the title of Augustus III., took refuge in a camp at Pirna,\r\nwhile Frederick marched into Bohemia and found the Austrians encamped\r\nat Lowositz under Marshal Count Brown, who was defeated there in\r\nOctober; and after a long and bloody contest forced to retire in rear\r\nof Egra.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that Loudon with his Croats joined the Austrian\r\narmy; and in the disastrous retreat which ensued after Lowositz, he\r\nnarrowly escaped when a hundred of his grenadiers were slain by the\r\nPrussian hussars. During Marshal Brown's retreat out of Saxony, Loudon\r\ntook by surprise the town of Estchen at the head of five hundred men,\r\nand destroyed two squadrons of Prussian hussars. This was his first\r\nexploit, and it was deemed the most brilliant of the Austrian campaign.\r\n\r\nHe distinguished himself again at Hirschfeld, on the Bohemian frontier;\r\nand for his bravery on that occasion was appointed colonel in February,\r\n1757.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of that month his corps had formed part of the six thousand\r\nAustrians who attacked the Prussian position at four in the morning.\r\nLoudon fought with incredible bravery, and slew many of the enemy with\r\nhis own hand. In August he attacked the Schriekstein and captured\r\nthree hundred newly raised soldiers. He now obtained an increased\r\ncommand--a small division, six thousand strong, consisting of Croats\r\nand Pandours. With these he attacked and defeated a body of the enemy\r\nat Erfurth, a garrison town of Saxony. He then joined the now allied\r\nFrench and Imperialists, who marched to Weissenfels, a city in the\r\ncentre of Thuringia. By this time the Swedes were pushing on the war\r\nin Pomerania and had besieged Stettin. Marshal Richelieu with eighty\r\nbattalions and one hundred squadrons of French had entered Halberstadt,\r\nand was everywhere levying contributions with fire and sword, while the\r\nAustrians had made themselves masters of Lignitz and most of Silesia;\r\nand after laying siege to Schwiednitz, were preparing to pass the Oder.\r\nEverywhere the tide of war had turned upon the King of Prussia.\r\n\r\nLoudon was now with what was named the _Combined Army_. The Prince de\r\nSoubise commanded the French; the Prince of Hildburghausen led the\r\nAustrians, and their united and immediate object was to clear Saxony\r\nof the Prussians. Frederick left a division to cover Silesia, and\r\napproached this Combined Army, which passed the Sala and established\r\nits head-quarters at Weissenfels; from whence the Comte de Mailly was\r\nsent to summon Leipzig. On the 5th November, the King of Prussia gave\r\nbattle to this Combined Army, then fifty thousand strong, at Rosbach,\r\na village of Prussian Saxony, at eleven o'clock in the morning. The\r\nallies were formed in line with their cavalry in front. The impetuosity\r\nof the Prussian infantry, whose charge was admirably sustained by a\r\nfire of artillery and advance of horse, broke the allied line, and,\r\nnotwithstanding all the efforts of the Prince de Soubise, Frederick\r\nobtained a complete victory with the loss of three hundred men only;\r\nwhile the Combined Army lost no less than eleven generals, three\r\nhundred other officers, nine thousand killed, wounded, and prisoners,\r\nsixty-three guns, twenty-nine colours, and one pair of kettle-drums.\r\nWith the battle of Rosbach terminated the campaign in Saxony.\r\n\r\nLoudon was with the Combined Army during all these operations; and the\r\nPrince of Hildburghausen, desirous of signalizing his own authority by\r\nsome grand stroke, proposed to the Prince de Soubise the project of\r\ndislodging the Prussians from the petty principality of Gotha, where\r\nSeidlitz commanded. They began their march accordingly with their\r\ngrenadiers and Austrian heavy cavalry, while Loudon led the Pandours\r\nand French light dragoons. They dispatched one column of cavalry over\r\nthe heights which led to Thuringia; another on the left, preceded by\r\nhussars, approached Gotha from the side of Langensaltza; while Loudon\r\nwith the Pandours, dragoons, and a body of grenadiers, formed the\r\ncolumn of the centre.\r\n\r\nSeidlitz was ready to receive them. He was in order of battle, and\r\nhad all the defiles secured by horse and cannon. A desultory conflict\r\nensued among the woods and mountains; and though the Prince de Soubise\r\ncut a passage to the castle wall of Gotha, he was obliged to retreat\r\nand leave three officers and one hundred and sixty soldiers in the\r\nhands of Seidlitz. The Prussian column under the Prince of Bavern\r\nattempted to cover Breslau, which surrendered on the 22nd November to\r\nthe Austrian generals, by whom he was made prisoner; while the remnant\r\nof his army joined Frederick, and on the 5th December the battle of\r\nLissa, where he gained a signal victory, was fought in Silesia. Such\r\nwas the severity of the season that many hundreds of soldiers were\r\nfound dead on their posts; and the German generals were reproached with\r\nheartlessly exposing their men to the extremity of cold; for a campaign\r\nin winter is alike opposed to the dictates of humanity and the common\r\nrules of war, as the operations of our own troops in the Crimea have\r\ngiven terrible proof.\r\n\r\nIn these arduous duties, though always at the head of his Croats and\r\nPandours, Loudon never received another wound, though exposed almost\r\ndaily to balls, bayonets, and sabres; and it is worthy of remark that\r\nthe musket-shot received at Zabern was the only scar of his long\r\nmilitary career.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1758 he received the Imperial military Order of\r\nMaria Theresa, which was instituted by the Empress Queen in the June\r\nof the preceding year. In this Order it is an inviolable principle\r\nthat no officer whatsoever, \"on account of his high birth, long\r\nservice, wounds, or former merits, much less from mere favour, or the\r\nrecommendation of others, be received; but that those only who have\r\nsignalized themselves by some particular act of valour, or have aided\r\nthe Imperial service by able and beneficial councils, and contributed\r\nto their execution by distinguished bravery, shall be admitted.\"\r\n\r\nIn the operations of the new year the King of Prussia recovered\r\nSchwiednitz from the Imperialists on the 16th April; entered Moravia\r\non the 27th May; invested Olmutz, which was stoutly defended by the\r\ngovernor, General Marshall, a Scotsman; while Marshal Daun, under\r\nwhom Loudon held a command, took post on the adjacent mountains, to\r\nintercept and cut off the Prussian convoys. The siege had now been\r\nopen for four weeks, and the trenches were rushed with great vigour\r\nby the Scottish exile--the gallant Marshal Keith--notwithstanding\r\nthe great difficulties attending it; for Loudon, bravely, and at\r\nincalculable hazard, in the defiles of Damstadt, in the principality of\r\nLichenstien, intercepted a convoy of four hundred waggons, and obliged\r\nGeneral Zeithen, who escorted them with twenty squadrons and three\r\nbattalions, after a five hours' encounter, to retire on Trappau. This\r\nloss was irreparable, for General Putkammer, eight hundred men, and the\r\n_military chest_ were taken.\r\n\r\nThe King of Prussia was compelled to raise the siege, and effected one\r\nof the most able retreats ever seen in Germany; he then marched to\r\noppose the Russians, who had broken into Brandenburg under Generals\r\nBrown and Farmer, two Scotsmen, whom he met in battle at Zorndorf,\r\ndefeated on the 25th August, and drove them into Poland.\r\n\r\nHad Loudon (who was ably seconded by Daun) _not_ intercepted General\r\nZeithen, \"the town of Olmutz must have been taken in a fortnight,\"\r\nsays Frederick, who styles it the Battle of the Convoy; \"for the third\r\nparallel was finished, and the besiegers had begun to open the saps.\"\r\nFor this service Loudon received the rank of lieutenant-field-marshal.\r\n\r\nHe had now won the reputation of being the first cavalry officer in\r\nthe service of the Empress-Queen; and he was of great use to Daun in\r\ngalling and incommoding the King of Prussia during the retreat from\r\nOlmutz.\r\n\r\nWith four thousand men he took post in the wood of Opotshno, a Bohemian\r\ntown, fifteen miles north-east of Koningengratz, where he intended to\r\nattack the Baron de la Mothe Fouque, who with thirty-two battalions\r\nand squadrons was conveying the heavy siege train. But there Loudon\r\nwas unexpectedly assailed by Frederick, who had heard of his projected\r\nambush, and marched to attack him in it, and he was forced to retire\r\nthrough the forest with the loss of a hundred Croatian troopers. He\r\nretreated towards Holitz, and thus the siege train passed unmolested to\r\nGlatz.\r\n\r\nLoudon and General St. Ignan followed Frederick closely; at\r\nKoningengratz their Pandours slew General Saldern, Colonel Blankenzee,\r\nand seventy men, but were checked by the sabres of Putkammer's hussars;\r\nand to prevent this harassing of the rear-guard, Frederick prepared an\r\nambuscade on a narrow path which lies through a wood at Metau. In this\r\ndefile he concealed ten battalions and twenty squadrons, under whose\r\nfire the Austrians were drawn by a few flying skirmishers. \"Loudon, who\r\nwas very easily heated,\" to quote Frederick, \"resolved on an assault;\"\r\nbut the Prussian cavalry poured upon him like a torrent, a fire opened\r\nupon his men from every point of the rocks and pass, three hundred were\r\nshot dead, and he was forced to retire. Soon after this he was lured\r\nagain, by the Volunteers of Le Noble, into a ravine near Skalitz, where\r\nhe was suddenly assailed by six battalions in the night, and had to\r\ngive way, with the loss of six officers and seventy men.\r\n\r\nHe took possession of Peitz, a town in the Duchy of Brandenburg, on the\r\nright bank of the Matx, and left no means untried to fulfil with signal\r\nsuccess his duty of covering Daun's left flank during the whole of the\r\nAustrian advance and Prussian retreat. Daun posted himself at Stolpen,\r\nto the eastward of the Elbe, on one hand to preserve a communication\r\nwith a column which he had detached to Koningstien, and on the other\r\nto favour the active operations of Marshal Loudon, who had advanced\r\nthrough Lower Lusatia to the frontier of Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Hochkirchen, which was fought on the 13th October, the\r\ndefeat of the Prussians was solely attributed to Loudon's skill and\r\nbravery. On the 12th he had attacked a great convoy, but was repulsed\r\nby Marshal the Honourable James Keith, with the loss of eighty men,\r\namong whom was the Prince de Lichenstien, lieutenant-colonel of the\r\nregiment of Löwenstien. After this Loudon assembled his dispersed\r\ntroops and took ground in a woody mountain, which was a long quarter\r\nof a league, German measure, beyond the Prussian right, facing the\r\nvillage of Hochkirchen. A marsh separated the flank of Frederick from\r\nthis height. Daun secretly prepared a road for four columns to form a\r\njunction with Loudon, who on the night of the 13th glided down with\r\nhis swift Pandours to the rear of the Prussian position, and set on\r\nfire the village of Hochkirchen, driving out by the edge of the sabre\r\nthe battalions quartered there, and seizing on a battery which defended\r\nan angle of the place; while the gallant Major Lang, with the regiment\r\nof the Margrave Charles, threw himself into the churchyard, and in the\r\ndark opened a blaze of musketry on the Pandours, whose light uniforms\r\nwere soon too fatally visible by the flames of the burning village.\r\nAround this conflagration the whole tide of battle rolled at midnight.\r\nThe aged Marshal Keith and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick were killed,\r\nand the Prussians were defeated with the loss of seven thousand men and\r\nmost of their camp equipage.\r\n\r\nMarshal Daun filled his despatch (which detailed this victory) with the\r\nhighest encomiums on Loudon, whom he sent immediately towards Silesia\r\nin pursuit of Frederick, whose forces he was to exclude from Lusatia;\r\nand so he followed and galled them with untiring zeal and vigour,\r\nthough he was then suffering from a severe and chronic disease in the\r\nstomach; but on his march towards the Saxon capital, the Prussian\r\nmonarch made one vigorous stand and repulsed him; after which he\r\nretired to Zittau.\r\n\r\nReinforced by 12,000 men, the marshal concealed himself in the forest\r\nof Schonberg, where he again attacked the Prussians, whose whole line\r\nof march became \"one battle;\" but Prince Henry, Frederick's brother,\r\ncommanded the rear-guard; and so excellent were his dispositions, that\r\nonly Lieutenant-General Bulow and 215 soldiers fell.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st November, Frederick began his march for Silesia. Loudon,\r\nstill pressing on, fell with such fury on the rear-guard, that he was\r\nnearly taken prisoner by the Prussian hussars. He then brought up his\r\ncannon; but these were dismounted by the heavier pieces of Frederick,\r\nwhich at the same time threw the Austrian foot into disorder. Thrice\r\nLoudon rallied them; and thrice, sword in hand, he led them to the\r\ncharge: but the approach of the noble Putkammer hussars compelled\r\nhim to fall back; and thus, amid skirmishes, night marches, toil,\r\nstarvation, plunder, and devastation, the campaign of the year was\r\nclosed by the Austrians raising the sieges of Neiss and Dresden, and\r\nthe King of Prussia retiring to winter quarters at Breslau.\r\n\r\nThe generals of the Imperial army usually spent the winter in the\r\nAustrian capital; and now the Empress expressed a strong desire to\r\nsee Marshal Loudon, of whom Count Daun had written so favourably in\r\nall his despatches and letters. Thus he prepared to return to Vienna,\r\nbut was compelled to remain for some time at Doeplitz in Bohemia, in\r\nconsequence of a return of his illness: and there Madame Loudon, who\r\nhad remained at Vienna during the whole war, arrived to attend him. As\r\nsoon as he was sufficiently restored, they travelled together to the\r\ncapital, where they arrived on the 24th of February, 1759. The streets\r\nwere crowded by dense masses of persons, all anxious to behold and to\r\nwelcome the hero of whom they had heard so much, and his reception\r\nwas most enthusiastic. Only two years had elapsed since he left\r\nthat city as a field-officer of Croats, and now he returned to it a\r\nLieutenant-Field-Marshal and Knight of Maria Theresa.\r\n\r\nFrom the fair Empress he received the most flattering distinction; and\r\nshe commanded her own physician, the Baron Von Swieten, to attend him\r\nuntil his health was completely re-established. She bestowed upon him\r\nthe Grand Cross of her Order, and created him a Baron of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe moment his physician permitted him, he resumed his command; and\r\nno general of the Seven Years' War bore a more distinguished part in\r\nthe campaign of 1759 than Baron Loudon, though Frederick II., who had\r\nimbibed an animosity to him, always mentions his name slightingly in\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian monarch, in the beginning of the year, had great success;\r\nbut his chief embarrassment was the approach of the Russians, who\r\ndefeated him in Silesia on the 23rd July, and spread their outposts\r\nalong the banks of the Oder. On the frontiers of Bohemia nothing of\r\nimportance occurred, though Loudon, who occupied Trautenau, was\r\ncontinually in motion, alarming the Prussian posts and cutting off\r\ntheir supplies.\r\n\r\nHe made an attack on General Seidlitz near Frederick's strong camp at\r\nSchmuckseiffen, and lost 150 men. Immediately after this, the Court of\r\nVienna gave him command of 20,000 men, 1200 of whom were dragoons, to\r\ngive vigour to their Russian allies, who were destitute of cavalry. By\r\nthe way of Greiffenberg he marched through Silesia, foiling, deceiving,\r\nand skirmishing with the horse of Prince Henry, till he took up a\r\nposition on the heights of Laubau, where he had fought the Prussians in\r\nthe preceding year. He chose this ground with the intention of being in\r\nadvance of them now, when he should receive orders to join the Russians\r\nunder Count Soltikow.\r\n\r\nWith this general he achieved a junction, and together they took up\r\na position at Cunnersdorff, opposite Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and gave\r\nbattle to Frederick at eleven o'clock, A.M., on the 12th of August.\r\nThe Russians had their intrenchments stormed amid great slaughter; a\r\nstarfort erected by them on two sand hills, to cover their right flank,\r\nwas carried at the point of the bayonet, and a dreadful massacre of\r\nthem ensued in the churchyard of Cunnersdorff. Under the glare of a\r\nburning sun, and sore with many a wound, the brave King of Prussia led\r\non his troops; and for two hours the infantry fought hand to hand.\r\nThe Jews' Cemetery, seven redoubts, and 180 pieces of cannon, were\r\nalready taken, when Loudon, perceiving that the Russians were unable to\r\nmaintain their ground, brought up his well-chosen reserves, and fired\r\nhis field-pieces loaded with case-shot, to sweep the Prussian line. He\r\nthen charged on both flanks with his fine Austrian cavalry, who bore\r\ndown all before them. The Prussians fell into confusion, and their rout\r\nbecame total. Frederick had two horses shot under him, and his blue\r\nuniform literally torn to rags by bullets and sword-cuts. The struggle\r\nwas awful, and night came down on a field where 30,000 men lay dead\r\nor dying, and of these more than the half were Prussians. The brave\r\nPutkammer was slain, and ten other generals lay killed or wounded near\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe movements of Frederick after this most signal defeat were of a\r\nmasterly description. He soon compelled Loudon and Soltikow to act\r\non the defensive, and recovered every place in the Saxon Electorate\r\nexcept Dresden. Forcing the Russians to retire into Poland, he joined\r\nhis brother Prince Henry in Saxony, compelled Marshal Daun to retreat\r\nas far as Plawen, and forced him to take shelter in the camp at Pirna;\r\nafter which he retired into winter quarters in November.\r\n\r\nFor his victory at Cunnersdorff Loudon was raised to the rank of\r\n_General-velt-zeug-Meister_; but he drew off from Soltikow with all his\r\ncavalry immediately after the battle.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1760 he received command of the army destined for\r\nservice in Silesia. It consisted of 40,000 men, and in all operations\r\nhe was to be seconded by the Russians, who, according to an agreement\r\nmade by the two Empresses, were to fight their way along the banks of\r\nthe Oder, while Daun carried on the war in Saxony. This army was light,\r\nand as unencumbered by baggage as a Pandour leader could desire. At\r\nits head Loudon left the camp in which he had passed the winter, and\r\nafter attacking and repulsing General Goltze at the head of his horse,\r\nhe left Draskowitz with 6000 men at Neustadt, and took the road to\r\nBohemia, after menacing in succession Silesia, into which he penetrated\r\nwith two corps, the new Marche of Brandenburg, Breslau, even Berlin\r\nand Schwiednitz. At last he fixed upon the latter, and General the\r\nBaron de la Mothe Fouque (who had weakened his forces by detaching the\r\nbrigades of the Scottish General Grant and General Zeithen), deceived\r\nby an artful feint, marched towards it with all his troops leaving the\r\ngarrison in Glatz quite unprotected.\r\n\r\nThe able Loudon at once perceived the success of his feint, or\r\nstratagem, and immediately had recourse to another. He took possession\r\nof Landshut, and left there a small body of troops, who were\r\nimmediately assailed and driven out by the Baron de la Mothe. While\r\nthe latter was thus occupied in recovering this trivial post, Loudon\r\nmade himself master of several important positions, and passed in\r\ntriumph through Johannesberg and Wisstengersdorff, and at Schwarzwalde\r\nrouted the hussars of Malachowski, and thus surrounded the baron's\r\nlittle army of Prussians. The latter did everything requisite to secure\r\ntheir position against the superior force of Loudon, who early in June\r\nattacked them with irresistible fury.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 23rd he seized two heights on the right, and formed\r\nthere two batteries, which swept the Prussian front and rear. He then\r\nstormed their intrenchments at the head of 28,000 men, and drove out\r\nthe enemy, who formed solid squares to repel his cavalry, which pushed\r\nthem in disordered masses on the Balkenhayn-road. Their squares were\r\nbroken, and 4000 men were slain. Among them fell the gallant baron,\r\npierced by two mortal wounds. Seven thousand men surrendered, and\r\nGlatz, the most important place between Silesia and Bohemia, as it\r\nstands in a narrow vale between two lofty hills, was the immediate\r\nconsequence of the victory. The Gersdorff hussars and dragoons of\r\nPlaten cut a passage to Breslau with 1500 of the infantry.\r\n\r\nPushing on, the victorious Loudon prepared to besiege that place, where\r\nhe expected to be joined by the Russians, and thus enabled to complete\r\nthe conquest of Silesia, the great object of the war. Encouraged by\r\nhis success at Glatz, he assailed the Silesian capital, and bombarded\r\nit with great success on the 30th July. He set forth in his summons to\r\nsurrender, \"that his forces consisted of fifty battalions and eighty\r\nsquadrons, most of which were within three days' march; that it was\r\nin vain for the governor to expect succour from the King of Prussia,\r\nnow on the other side of the Elbe, and still more vain to look for\r\nrelief from Prince Henry, who must sink beneath the Russian sword if\r\nhe attempted to obstruct its progress; and that the inhabitants must\r\nresign all hope of terms or quarter if they ventured to defend the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the governor was firm and noble. Loudon showered bombs\r\nand red-hot balls on one side, while attempting an assault on the other.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry, one of the most accomplished of the Prussian generals,\r\nadvanced to its relief by a forced march of one hundred and twenty\r\nEnglish miles in five days, resolving to give the Baron battle before\r\nthe Russians joined him; and on his approach Loudon prudently raised\r\nthe siege and retired, though he still kept Neiss and Schwiednitz\r\nunder blockade. The King of Prussia by this time was on his memorable\r\nmarch to prevent the junction of the Russian and Imperial armies in\r\nSilesia; and with this intention had encamped at Lignitz, where,\r\nwhile encompassed by three hostile columns, he gave battle to Loudon.\r\nAttacking him at three o'clock, A.M., on the 15th August, near Lignitz,\r\nhe repulsed him with loss before Daun could come to his assistance; and\r\nfurther secured his own rear effectually by a strong _corps de reserve_\r\nand park of artillery posted on the heights of Paffendorf.\r\n\r\nFrederick obtained some information as to Loudon's disposition of force\r\nfrom an Austrian officer, an Irishman, who had deserted. \"He was so\r\nintoxicated,\" says Frederick, in his own _History_, \"that he could\r\nonly stammer out he had a secret to reveal. After making him swallow\r\nsome basins of warm water to relieve his stomach, he affirmed what\r\nhad been divined, that Daun meant to attack the king that very day.\"\r\nLoudon made incredible efforts, on foot and on horseback, to maintain\r\nhis ground. After receiving five consecutive charges of five lines of\r\nfive battalions each, the confusion of the Austrians became general,\r\nand they fled towards Binowitz. The battle of Paffendorf cost Loudon\r\nten thousand men; the field, which sloped like a glacis, was occupied\r\nby the Prussians, who took two generals, eighty other officers, six\r\nthousand soldiers, twenty-three pairs of colours, and eighty-two pieces\r\nof cannon!\r\n\r\nWe next find the indefatigable Loudon in position at Hohenfriedberg,\r\na small Silesian town, which he had to abandon on the night of the\r\n11th September, finding his flank turned by the Prussian vanguard on\r\ntheir gaining the pass of Kauder. On the 18th he occupied the defiles\r\nof Giersdorf, and that night, by a cannonade prevented the enemy from\r\nadvancing to Wahlenburg. He next laid siege to the strong and important\r\nfortress of Kosel, seventy-three miles distant from Breslau, and\r\nthreatened the whole province with subjection.\r\n\r\nThe Russians and Austrians now effected their junction again, and\r\ntogether made themselves masters of Berlin on the 4th October; after\r\nwhich the affairs of the great Frederick seemed desperate; but he\r\nresolved to retrieve them by some decided effort. Crossing the Elbe,\r\nhe hurried into Saxony, followed by Daun with eighty thousand men,\r\nwhom he routed at Toorgau on the 23rd November. By this he recovered\r\nall that he had previously lost; the Russians retired into Poland, the\r\nAustrians evacuated the desolated province of Silesia, and the Swedes\r\ntook refuge on the shores of the Baltic. By the defeat of Daun, Loudon\r\nwas compelled abruptly to raise the siege of Kosel and retire out of\r\nthe province.\r\n\r\nIn 1760, Bohemia, Silesia, and other parts of Germany presented a\r\nlamentable aspect. Cities were empty, villages desolate, and castles\r\nin ruins. The fields were ravaged and destroyed, till a famine was at\r\nhand; wives and children had perished; husbands and fathers had been\r\ndriven into the ranks of adverse armies, to fight for bare subsistence\r\nrather than their blackened hearths and rifled homes; trade was\r\nneglected; the seats of learning abandoned; the land untilled: and all\r\nthis curse had fallen upon the people by the mad ambition of their\r\nkings and princes.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter Loudon's activity prevented Frederick from obtaining\r\nrecruits, provisions, or forage from the principalities or circles of\r\nNeiss, Groskau, Frankestien, Strehlen, Neustadt, and Oppelen.\r\n\r\nIn January he repaired to Vienna, to assist at the councils of war and\r\narrange the plan of the new campaign.\r\n\r\nIn this year (1761) he was destined by the Court of Vienna to undertake\r\na war of sieges in Silesia, where he was to be supported by the\r\nRussians; and on the 10th of March he resumed the command of his\r\ndivision. In April he wrote to the Empress stating that since the 18th\r\ninstant he had revoked the truce made with General Goltze, and intended\r\nto fix his head-quarters at Caretau, a league from Glatz. In May he\r\npatrolled the country about Lignitz and Jauer to levy contributions,\r\nand eighty-seven of his men were cut off by General Tatter at Rostock.\r\nAbout the 12th May, on Frederick's approach, he retired into Bohemia,\r\nby the way of Gattesberg, before eighty thousand men, and on the 6th of\r\nJune established his head-quarters at Hauptmonsdorf.\r\n\r\nFrederick was resolved to act solely on the defensive, being tired of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st July he was encamped at Pulzen, when Loudon, who occupied\r\nthe opposite mountains, descended by the defile of Steinkunzerdorf,\r\nfeigning to attack the fortress of Neiss. This drew Frederick out; and\r\nthey engaged on the heights of Munsterberg, where a warm cannonade\r\nensued. On the 23rd Loudon encamped at Ober Pomsdorf; \"and either from\r\nnative restlessness, or a habit of commanding detachments, in eight\r\ndays he changed his position six times; for which no satisfactory\r\nreason could be given.\" On the 17th July the whole of the Prussian army\r\nreceived the communion, and sixty rounds of ball per man.\r\n\r\nLoudon's force, after he was joined by General Brettano from Saxony,\r\namounted to eighty thousand men. He was also joined by a column of\r\nRussians under General Czernicheff. He received a letter from Maria\r\nTheresa, wherein she somewhat needlessly \"gave him full power to give\r\nor decline battle as he chose; and this power was to extend to all\r\nhis military operations in general.\" In the first days of August he\r\ntransmitted to her a letter which he had received from Frederick of\r\nPrussia, and written by his own hand, in which he offered him great\r\nsums \"if he would agree to act _faintly_ in this campaign.\" Loudon\r\nat the same time sent the Empress a copy of his answer, importing,\r\n\"that being accountable to God and to his sovereign for his conduct,\r\nall the treasures of the earth should not tempt him from his duty to\r\neither; and that he begged his Prussian Majesty would make him no more\r\nproposals so repugnant to his duty, and so injurious to his honour.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th August he detached forty-three squadrons of horse to join\r\na Russian column which had passed the Oder; but Frederick met them\r\non their march near Parchwitz, and defeated them, taking all their\r\ncolours and cannon. These troops were horse grenadiers--the flower of\r\nthe Austrian cavalry. The march of Loudon to form a junction \"with the\r\nRussians,\" say the London papers for 10th September, 1761, \"is alone\r\nsufficient to raise his reputation as a general as high as even a\r\nvictory could have done. He had marched seven hours before the enemy\r\nhad the least suspicion of his design, and had a conference with\r\nMarshal Butterlin near this place (Lignitz); on his return from which\r\nhe narrowly escaped being taken prisoner by the fleetness of his horse,\r\nhis escort being attacked smartly by a strong detachment of Prussians.\"\r\nThe allies afterwards separated; and the Hamburg journals asserted that\r\nit \"was owing to a pique and jealously between Laudohn and Butterlin\r\nabout the command, and the open antipathy of their respective troops to\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long series of marches, manoeuvres, and feigned attacks, in\r\nwhich he had completely the better of the great Frederick, Loudon\r\nsuddenly appeared before Schwiednitz, the ancient and fortified capital\r\nof a principality situated among the hills of Lower Silesia. Its walls\r\nwere manned by a brave Prussian garrison; but, to cut off all succour,\r\nLoudon posted twenty battalions on the heights of Kunzendorf, which are\r\nso steep that they cannot be taken from any troops who possess them.\r\n\r\nFrederick's army, consisting of sixty-six battalions, one hundred and\r\nforty-three squadrons, and four hundred and six pieces of cannon,\r\nencamped at Bunzelwitz, in a place surrounded by chevaux-de-frize,\r\nabattis, mines, and palisades. Loudon made a partial attack upon this\r\nformidable post; but, pushing on, he resolved to take Schwiednitz by\r\nsurprise. Previous to the advance, says an officer of his army, in one\r\nof his letters, \"his Excellency our general having assembled upon\r\nthe Limelberg, the troops destined to scale the walls of Schwiednitz\r\nharangued them there, and promised them a reward of one hundred\r\nthousand florins if the place was taken without pillage.\r\n\r\n\"'No, no!' exclaimed the Walloon grenadiers; 'lead us on, and we will\r\nfollow to glory; but we will take no money from you, our father Loudon!'\r\n\r\n\"Then the Count de Wallace, colonel of the regiment of Loudon\r\nFusiliers, after being twice repulsed by two battalions of the brave\r\nregiment of Treskow, said to his soldiers,--\r\n\r\n\"'I must carry this fort or die! I have promised it to Loudon;\r\n_remember that our regiment bears his name--it must conquer or perish!_'\r\n\r\n\"This short speech produced a surprising effect. An entire battalion\r\nsprung furiously into the ditch. The officers themselves fixed the\r\nscaling-ladders, and were the first that mounted. M. de Wallace had\r\nthe glory of forcing the most difficult point of attack, and taking\r\nprisoners two battalions, who made the most courageous defence.\"[18]\r\n\r\nTwenty battalions had been distributed to the four points of attack.\r\nOne column advanced to the Breslau gate, a second on the Strigau gate,\r\na third to the fort of Bockendorf, and a fourth on the redoubt of Eau.\r\nOn the 1st October, at three in the morning, favoured by a dense fog,\r\nLoudon and Wallace led their soldiers to the assault; and the escalade\r\nwas made with such rapidity, that the garrison had only time to fire\r\n_twelve_ cannon shot. Lieutenant-General Zastrow, the governor, who had\r\nbeen at a ball, hurried his troops to arms; but the contest was short;\r\na few volleys were exchanged, when a magazine blew up and killed eight\r\nhundred Prussians in the fort of Bockendorf. Taking advantage of the\r\nconfusion, Wallace rushed on, burst open the gates of the town, and\r\nwith the loss of only six hundred men, Loudon was master of the place\r\nbefore daybreak. Zastrow and three thousand men were taken, with a\r\ngreat store of all the munition of war. This was a severe blow to the\r\npride of Frederick, who was weak enough to attribute the success of\r\nLoudon to the treachery of Major Rocca, an Italian prisoner; but an\r\nofficer named De Beville made a noble defence in the redoubt of Eau.\r\n\r\nLoudon garrisoned the town by ten battalions, under General Butler, an\r\nIrishman; and after remaining long encamped at Freyburg, in December\r\nhe sent O'Donnel into Saxony after a body of Prussians, and cantoned\r\nhis own troops among the mountains, while the Russians wintered in\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1761 an epidemic malady made great ravages in the\r\narmy of Loudon. It was a kind of leprosy, the progress of which was so\r\nrapid, that it soon thinned his ranks, and filled the hospitals and\r\ncemeteries.\r\n\r\nThe year 1762 saw a fortunate change in the affairs of Prussia; Peter\r\nIII., a peaceful prince, succeeded to the Russian throne, and formed\r\nan alliance _with_ Frederick, who did not fail to profit by it, and\r\nretook Schwiednitz, though garrisoned by 9000 men, in spite of the\r\nutmost efforts made by Daun and Loudon to prevent him. After this he\r\nconcluded with Maria Theresa a cessation of hostilities in Saxony and\r\nSilesia; and soon after peace was secured to Germany by the treaty of\r\nHubertsbourg, on the 16th of February, 1763.\r\n\r\nIn the seven campaigns of the _Seven Years' War_ seventeen pitched\r\nbattles had been fought; three sieges had been undertaken and five\r\nsustained by Prussia, with innumerable skirmishes. Austria took 40,000\r\nPrussian prisoners, and Prussia took the same number of Austrians. The\r\nhospitals were full of maimed and suffering soldiers. In each regiment,\r\non an average, only eight officers, and less than 100 men, were alive\r\nwho had witnessed the commencement of the war. Loudon was the only\r\nofficer, not born a prince or of an illustrious family, who had risen\r\nto such high rank during that sanguinary struggle. He was, moreover,\r\na stranger, _a foreigner_, and a soldier of fortune. At the peace\r\nthe Empress presented him with the lordship of Klien Betchwar, not\r\nfar from Kolin. On this he built a strong and beautiful castle, with\r\nthe revenues which he derived from a barony in Bohemia; and there he\r\nretired to enjoy a few years of repose and peace, and to overlook the\r\ncultivation and improvement of his estate.\r\n\r\nIn 1766 the grateful Empress made him Aulic Councillor of War; in 1767\r\nthe highest nobles of the Empire received him as one of their members;\r\nand in 1769 he was appointed Commandant-General in Moravia.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 he was present at the interview between the Emperor Joseph and\r\nhis old antagonist Frederick the Great of Prussia. Dissembling that\r\nungenerous animosity which he had imbibed against the fortunate Loudon,\r\nFrederick always addressed him as \"M. Velt-Maréschal,\" though he had\r\nnot attained that rank in full; and when Loudon, with his natural\r\nreserve, was about to seat himself at the foot of the royal table,--\r\n\r\n\"Sit next to me, M. de Loudon,\" said his Prussian Majesty; \"for, be\r\nassured, I love better to see you by my side than _opposite_ to me.\"\r\n\r\nAt his departure he presented the baron with two horses, the finest of\r\nhis stud.\r\n\r\nIn 1778 Loudon was gazetted to the rank of Field-Marshal, and was\r\nplaced at the head of an army 50,000 strong, to defend the interests\r\nof Austria in the new war which broke out between the great powers of\r\nGermany, on the death of Maximilian Joseph, the Elector of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nHe posted the army of the Emperor behind the Elbe, in strongly\r\nfortified positions; and distributed his own corps among the secure\r\nposts of the Riechenberg (on the same ground where the Austrians were\r\ndefeated by the Duke of Brunswick in 1757); of Gabelona, a fortified\r\ntown which occupies an important pass; of Schlukenau, thirty miles\r\nfrom Dresden, and towards Lusatia; but the main body of his troops\r\nhe skilfully distributed between Leutmeritz, a well-fortified town;\r\nLowositz, in the same circle, but four miles distant from it; Dux and\r\nTöplitz. The King of Prussia took the field with all his force, to\r\nprevent the Emperor from co-operating with Loudon, to whom he opposed\r\nthe column of Prince Henry: and now ensued a campaign full of interest\r\nonly to those who study brilliant manoeuvres and subtle tactics.\r\n\r\nLoudon's posts at Schlukenau, Rumberg, and Gabelona were taken by\r\nthe prince, who forced him to abandon Aussig and Dux, with the\r\nfortifications and magazine at Leutmeritz, and, indeed, all the left\r\nbank of the Elbe; but falling back on the Iser, he skilfully secured\r\nits passages by strong detachments. In short, so equal was the\r\ndistribution of strength, numbers, skill, and discipline, that the war\r\nwas a mere succession of able movements, but barren of striking events;\r\nand after a year of marches and skirmishes, the Emperor relinquished\r\nLower Bavaria, on which he had seized unjustly, and a peace was\r\nconcluded on the 13th May, 1779, the birthday of the Empress-Queen.\r\n\r\nAfter this Loudon returned to his sequestered castle; and once more,\r\nfor eight years, resumed the peace and pleasure of a country life.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, when in his seventy-first year, he was again summoned to the\r\nfield by the Emperor, to lead the Austrian armies against the Turks;\r\nand a series of brilliant captures and encounters realized all that had\r\nbeen hoped from his old valour and experience.\r\n\r\nHe poured his hosts along the Croatian and the Bosnian frontiers; and\r\nin August, 1788, after two fruitless assaults, in one of which 430\r\nof his men were killed and wounded, he received by capitulation the\r\nfortress of Dubitzar, on the right bank of the Unna. On the 20th the\r\nTurks had attacked his camp, but were repulsed; after which he again\r\nordered an immediate assault; but, as it failed, he ordered the town to\r\nbe fired, and it burned till the morning of the 24th. He then opened\r\nseveral mines, and by the 25th his sappers were within ten feet of the\r\nwalls. The Turks then \"capitulated to Marshal Loudon, whose principal\r\nterms were:--\r\n\r\n\"That the officers might march out with swords, but their troops were\r\nto lay down all arms and surrender as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\n\"That the women and children might go to Roczaracz, attended by five\r\nTurkish soldiers, for whose return the commandant should be answerable.\"\r\n\r\nNovi-bazar, a Bosnian Sanjak, the capital of a province, with its\r\ncastle, next fell into his possession; then Gradiska, a strong Turkish\r\nfortress which had been erected fifteen years before by French\r\nengineers, at the junction of the Virbas with the Saave; then Belgrade,\r\nthe most important town and fortress on the Austrian frontier of the\r\nTurkish empire. Its citadel occupies a commanding position on the\r\nsummit of a precipitous rock which rises in the centre of the streets\r\nand is surrounded by a lofty wall, a triple fosse with flanking\r\ntowers, and an esplanade 400 paces broad. These works were principally\r\nconstructed by Benjamin Swinburne, a native of Staffordshire, who had\r\nembraced Islamism, adopted the name of Mustapha, and risen to high rank\r\nin the Turkish artillery. Led on by Loudon, the Austrians overcame\r\nevery obstacle, and captured this famous Belgrade.\r\n\r\nIn that town he found a fine funeral monument of white marble, covered\r\nwith Turkish inscriptions, arabesqued ornaments, and sculptured\r\ngarlands of flowers. He had this great sarcophagus carefully taken to\r\npieces and sent to his estate of Hadersdorf, to form a tomb for himself.\r\n\r\nIn this war of carnage, as it was justly named, for no quarter was\r\ngiven on either side, the Imperialists numbered at first 218,000\r\nbayonets and sabres; but they were soon reduced to half that number by\r\nthe resistance of the Turks.\r\n\r\nNeu-Orchova, a small town and fortress of Wallachia situated on an\r\nisland on the Danube, was his last capture after he had defeated the\r\nBashaw of Travernick and was repulsed in turn from two practicable\r\nbreaches; but he reduced it by a regular siege; and with this ended the\r\nTurkish war, which he had conducted with glory to Austria and ended\r\nwith honour to himself.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 he returned to the army in Moravia.\r\n\r\nHe was now seventy-four years of age, and his health was failing fast.\r\nDuring the latter part of his life he had been much afflicted with\r\nrheumatism, gout, and colic, the fruit of military toil and hardship.\r\nAll these attacked him regularly every spring and autumn.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June he dined with Prince Lichnowski, at Böhmisch\r\nGratzen, and was seized on that night by a fever, from which he\r\npredicted he would never recover, and about the 6th of July he was in a\r\ndying state. Observing around his bed many of his old brother officers\r\nin tears, he endeavoured to console and reassure them by the calmness\r\nof his own demeanour.\r\n\r\n\"I implore you,\" said he, \"to unite true religion to that high courage\r\nwhich I know you to possess, and to defend your minds from the\r\napproaches of atheism. All the success I have had in this world I owe\r\nto my confidence in God, as well as the glorious consolation which\r\nI now experience, in this awful time, when I am so soon to appear\r\nbefore Him.\" On the 10th, he requested the sacrament, and begged the\r\nMarshals Colloredo and Botta to be present at the reading of his will,\r\nand to bear his dying blessing and remembrances to the old officers\r\nand soldiers who had served under him. Then perceiving his favourite\r\nnephew, Alexander Loudon, weeping at his bedside, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Arise--be a man and a Christian--love God and your fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nHe lingered on until the 14th of July, when he expired in great agony.\r\n\r\nThus died, in the year 1790, Field-Marshal Baron Loudon, one of the\r\ngreatest generals of the eighteenth century. \"It was but seldom that\r\na smile was seen to unwrinkle his lofty forehead,\" says a writer of\r\nhis own time. \"He was as little acquainted with the real laugh as\r\nCato. As to his character, he knew how to diversify it wonderfully.\r\nLoudon on horseback and at the head of an army appeared to be quite\r\nanother man, and was indeed a complete contrast to Loudon in the\r\ncountry or the town. His conduct agreed perfectly with what his cold\r\nand reserved physiognomy announced, for he spoke but little, and\r\nslowly. From his early youth he constantly avoided the society of\r\nwomen; he was uncommonly timid in their company, and was a very good\r\nhusband. Accustomed to find himself punctually obeyed by thousands\r\nin the field, at the least sign indicated by him, he required the\r\nsame docility of his vassals and servants, and he acted with severity\r\nto them--perhaps more than ought to have been used to men who were\r\nunaccustomed to military discipline.\"\r\n\r\nAs a souvenir of the many perils he had passed through, he carefully\r\npreserved at Hadersdorf a musket-ball which had been cut in two on\r\nthe pommel of his saddle, and also his Croatian sabre, which had been\r\nstruck from his hand by a bomb, and bent so that no armourer could ever\r\nstraighten it.\r\n\r\nHis remains were enclosed in a double coffin, adorned by gorgeous\r\nmountings and handles, and were solemnly borne from Böhmisch Gratzen\r\nto his estate of Hadersdorf, a small town of Lower Austria, near the\r\nKlein-Kamp, and five miles west of Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn the park he had once selected a spot shaded by many fine trees,\r\nunder which he had expressed a wish to be buried; but, on his return\r\nfrom the Turkish campaign, he selected another place, and planted it\r\nwith shrubs and flowers in imitation of a Moslem sepulchre; and this he\r\nwas wont to term his Turkish Garden, for therein he had reconstructed\r\nthe marble sarcophagus which had been conveyed from Belgrade.\r\n\r\nThere he now lies in peace, shaded by some stately old trees and in the\r\ncentre of a green meadow. His funeral monument, which is one of great\r\nmagnificence, is securely walled round; and among the sculpture with\r\nwhich the Austrian Government adorned it, there may still be traced\r\nthe shield _argent_, charged with three escutcheons _sable_; the old\r\nheraldic cognizance which the Loudons of that ilk carried on their\r\npennons in the wars of the Scottish kings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Letter from an officer to a friend at Ratisbon, Oct.\r\n25th, 1761.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT O'REILLY,\r\n\r\nCHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere we to choose a hero for a military romance, he would be Andrew\r\nO'Reilly, who bore the high reputation of being the first cavalry\r\nofficer in the Austrian service.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished Irish soldier of fortune, the _last_ of the _éleves_\r\nof the Lacys and others whose achievements in the third Silesian war\r\nand the Turkish campaign have already been recorded, obtained the rank\r\nof General in the Austrian army, Chamberlain, and Commander of the\r\nImperial and Military Order of Maria Theresa, with the rank of Colonel\r\nProprietaire of the 3rd Regiment of Light Horse.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1740, and was the second son of James O'Reilly, of\r\nBallincough, in the county of Westmeath, and of Barbara, daughter of\r\nThomas Nugent, Esquire, of Dysart (grand-daughter of Thomas, fourth\r\nEarl of Westmeath). His brother Hugh was created a Baronet by George\r\nIII., and subsequently assumed the name of Nugent. His only sister\r\nmarried Lord Talbot de Malahide.\r\n\r\nEntering the Imperial service early in life, O'Reilly filled in\r\nsuccession all the military grades save that of Field-Marshal; but\r\nof those events in his stirring life which led to his elevation to\r\na coronet, we barely afford a summary. One of the most important\r\nincidents in his early career is connected with his marriage; and\r\nwhile it illustrates the manners of the last century, is worthy of\r\nnotice, for the remnant of old romance and chivalry it displays. He\r\nand a brother officer, Count Klebelsberg, uncle of Francis Count de\r\nKlebelsberg, who, in 1831, was President of the Government of Lower\r\nAustria, were rivals for the hand of the Countess Wuyrlena, a rich\r\nand beautiful Bohemian heiress; and aware that _both_ could not\r\nsucceed, they determined to solve the difficulty of selection by a\r\ncombat _à l'outrance_. The intended duel was, however, reported to the\r\nauthorities, and both O'Reilly and Klebelsberg were placed under close\r\narrest by the Director General of the High Police; but, resolved to\r\nachieve their purpose, they secretly left Vienna, and travelled post\r\ntogether to Poland, and meeting in the neutral territory of Cracow,\r\nfought their remarkable combat. The duel lasted long, for both were\r\nperfect swordsmen, active, skilful, and wary; but at length O'Reilly\r\nran Klebelsberg through the body, after receiving many dangerous wounds\r\nin his own person.\r\n\r\nThe affections of the countess, with her hand and fortune, were the\r\nimmediate reward of the soldier of fortune.\r\n\r\nRejoining the army, he served with great brilliance in the war between\r\nFrance and Austria. The forces of the latter were commanded by the\r\nArchduke Charles.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th June, 1800, he fought under General Melas, at the battle of\r\nMarengo. \"Melas,\" says M. Thiers, in his _History of the Consulate and\r\nEmpire_, \"placed General O'Reilly on the left, and Generals Kaim and\r\nHaddick on the right, to gain the road to Piacenza, the object of so\r\nmany efforts and the salvation of the Austrian army.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd December, 1805, that great day when \"the sun of Austerlitz\r\narose,\" and eighty thousand Frenchmen, flushed by rapid conquests,\r\nby the capitulation of Ulm, and the recent capture of Vienna, met\r\nthe Austro-Russian army in one of the bloodiest battles on record--a\r\nbattle, which, as General Rapp has it, \"was a veritable butchery, where\r\nwe fought man to man, and so mingled together, that the infantry on\r\neither side dared not fire lest they should kill their own men\"--the\r\nstar of Napoleon bore all before it; and the French, though losing\r\nthirteen thousand men, totally routed their allied enemies, with\r\nthe loss of thrice that number, taking all their colours, baggage,\r\nammunition, and one hundred and twenty pieces of cannon. On that\r\nterrible day, the political result of which was an almost immediate\r\ncessation of hostilities between France and Austria, it was universally\r\nadmitted that a succession of daring and brilliant charges made by the\r\nLight Dragoons of O'Reilly, \"alone saved the Austrian army from total\r\nannihilation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Alexander declined the overtures of Bonaparte, and renewed\r\nthe war next year. The field of Eylau gave his Russians a partial\r\nrevenge; and ere long they reaped the fulness of it amid the flames of\r\nMoscow and the slaughter of Smolensko.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of May, 1809, O'Reilly, for his services at Austerlitz and\r\nelsewhere, was appointed Governor of Vienna, with a powerful garrison;\r\nand in a few days after, the Eagles of Napoleon were at its gates.\r\nShut up in the city with the troops, the Archduke Ferdinand resolved\r\nto defend it, though the French had already stormed and carried all\r\nthe suburbs. In vain were flags of truce sent in; the bearers were\r\nnot only refused admittance, but, despite the orders of O'Reilly,\r\nwere even maltreated, and in some instances massacred by the people.\r\nThe bombardment followed, and soon Vienna was wrapped in flames; but\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon, being informed by O'Reilly that one of the\r\narchduchesses had remained in Vienna detained by illness, gave orders\r\nto cease firing.\r\n\r\n\"Strange destiny of Napoleon!\" exclaims old General Bourrienne; \"this\r\narchduchess was Maria Louisa!\"--the future Empress of France.\r\n\r\nOn O'Reilly devolved the difficult and trying task of obtaining\r\nhonourable terms for the capital of the Empire, from an enemy\r\nflushed by victory and the pride of a hundred hard-fought fields. He\r\naccordingly deputed the Prince of Dietrechstien, the Burgomaster,\r\nand the chief citizens to Napoleon, who inveighed bitterly against\r\nthe obstinacy of the gallant Archduke Ferdinand, but lauded the\r\ncoolness, bravery, and great presence of mind of the governor, whom he\r\nemphatically terms \"_le respectable General O'Reilly_,\" and accepted\r\nall the terms proposed by him; but in the fourteenth clause stipulated\r\nthat O'Reilly should be the bearer of the treaty to his master, to\r\nthe end that he should honestly and faithfully lay before him the\r\ntrue position of the now half-conquered Austrian Empire--and this duty\r\nO'Reilly ably performed.\r\n\r\nHe served in the great battle fought near Aspern on the Marchfeld,\r\nduring the 21st and 22nd of May, between the French under Napoleon, and\r\nthe Austrians under the Archduke Charles.\r\n\r\nIn the prince's plan of the attack \"to be made upon the hostile army,\r\non its march between Essling and Aspern,\" it was ordered \"that the\r\ncavalry brigade under the command of Veesy will be attached to the\r\nsecond column, and the _Regiment O'Reilly_ to the third.\" This regiment\r\nconsisted of eight squadrons of Light Dragoons, and the column to which\r\nit was attached comprised twenty-two battalions.\r\n\r\nO'Reilly, with his cavalry, followed the column which marched from\r\nSeiring, by the road of Sussenbrunn and Breitenbe. Here O'Reilly, with\r\nseveral troops of Light Horse and Chasseurs formed the advanced guard,\r\nwhich met the enemy's cavalry at three o'clock in the afternoon, near\r\nHirschstettin, while the other columns of the Austrian army drew the\r\nFrench back upon their position between Esslingen and Aspern, and while\r\nLieutenant-General Hohenzollern ordered up his batteries, and the\r\nbattle became general on all sides.\r\n\r\nIn close column of battalions, the line of the third column was\r\nadvancing with great bravery, when the French cavalry fell upon them,\r\nsabre in hand, with such fury, that they were repulsed, and nearly lost\r\ntheir cannon. At this moment the regiments of Zach, Colloredo, Zetwitz,\r\nand the second battalion of the legion of the Archduke Charles, led\r\nby Lieutenant-General Brady, an Irish officer, \"demonstrated with\r\nunparalleled fortitude what the fixed determination to conquer or die\r\nis capable of effecting against the most impetuous attacks.\"\r\n\r\nThe splendid cavalry of France turned both flanks of Brady's column,\r\nand penetrating between them, repulsed the Light Horse of O'Reilly,\r\nwho came up at full speed to succour the soldiers of his countryman.\r\nSurrounded, the Regiment O'Reilly were summoned to lay down their\r\narms; but a destructive fire of carbines was the answer to this\r\ndegrading proposition, and the French cavalry gave way.\r\n\r\nThe Regiment O'Reilly passed the night on the field of battle, which\r\nwas lost by the Austrians. The market town of Aspern, on the north side\r\nof the Danube, was destroyed, and the loss of the Imperialists was\r\nfrightful.\r\n\r\nAfter a two days' conflict, there lay on that field the flower of the\r\nAustrian army; 87 field-officers, 4199 subalterns and privates, 12\r\ngenerals (including the Prince de Rohan), 663 officers, and 15,651\r\nsoldiers were wounded; of these, Field-Marshal Webber, with 8 officers,\r\nand 329 men were taken prisoners, with 3 pieces of cannon, 7 powder\r\nwaggons, 17,000 muskets, and 3000 corslets. The loss of the French was\r\nterrible! 7000 men and an immense number of horses were buried on the\r\nfield; 29,773 wounded men strewed the streets and suburbs of Vienna;\r\nhundreds of corpses, gashed and shattered, floated down the rapid\r\nDanube and were flung upon its shores, where they lay unburied and\r\ndecaying, filling the air with pestilence and the place with horror.\r\n\r\nIn October peace was signed at the camp of Schoenbrunn, and, divorcing\r\nthe woman who had loved him when he had only his sword and his\r\nepaulettes, Napoleon espoused Maria Louisa of Austria; and Prince\r\nCharles, who by his accumulated blunders at the battle of Aspern, had\r\nthrown away the fortunes of Continental Europe, received from his\r\nImperial conqueror the Grand Riband of the Legion of Honour. O'Reilly\r\ncame in for a full share of the honours and decorations which were\r\nshowered upon the Austrian army.\r\n\r\nAt the general peace of 1814 the Empire, exhausted by a war of\r\nfive-and-twenty years, reduced her vast military establishments to\r\n58 regiments of the line, 12 battalions of chasseurs, and 5 garrison\r\nbattalions--in all, 1044 companies of fusiliers, and 116 of grenadiers.\r\nThe cavalry were reduced to 36 regiments of cuirassiers, light\r\ndragoons, uhlans and hussars. Of the third regiment of light horse\r\nO'Reilly was colonel and proprietor. He was also High Chamberlain of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nAt this time Louis Count Taaffe, a noble of Irish parentage, was\r\nSecond President of the Austrian High Court of Justice, and General\r\nCount O'Donnel was Military Governor of Austrian Lombardy. One of the\r\nEmperor's most distinguished officers was General Count Nugent, who\r\nin the war of 1847-8 led 30,000 Austrian infantry to succour Marshal\r\nRadetzki, who was then opposed to the troops of Charles Albert.[19]\r\nCount Taaffe was a member of the new ministry formed on the 21st of\r\nMarch, in the year of the Austrian revolution: but he retired from\r\noffice shortly before the appearance of the chartered constitution on\r\nthe 19th of April.\r\n\r\nO'Reilly lived to see Austria affected by the commotions which pervaded\r\nEurope after the French Revolution of 1830, when the Duke of Modena\r\nand the Archduke of Parma were obliged to quit these states, and a\r\nformidable insurrection broke out in the Patrimony of St. Peter--an\r\ninsurrection to quell which 18,000 Austrian troops were marched\r\ntowards the frontier; but O'Reilly was too far advanced in years to\r\ndraw his sword again in the service of the House of Hapsburg. He died\r\nin October, 1833, at Vienna, after attaining the patriarchal age of\r\n_ninety-two_. He had long survived his countess, and died childless.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Nugent, a field-marshal in 1858, commanded 25,000\r\nAustrian troops at the funeral of Marshal Radetzki, and acted as chief\r\nmourner.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT O'CONNELL,\r\n\r\nKNIGHT OF ST. LOUIS, AND COLONEL OF THE IRISH BRIGADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of this military wanderer presents, in his chequered career,\r\nthe curious anomaly of a general and his soldiers being received into\r\nthe service of their native country and native monarch, against whom\r\nthey had previously fought with a bravery that too often gave the\r\nlaurels of victory to his enemies.\r\n\r\nCount Daniel O'Connell was of the same family as the famous political\r\nagitator who bore his name, and he sprang from an old Milesian race\r\nwho held the rank of Toparchs in their own province. He was the son\r\nof Daniel O'Connell of Derrynane, and of Mary, daughter of Duffe\r\nO'Donoghue, of Anwys in the county Kerry, Ireland, and was born at\r\nDerrynane Abbey, in 1742. At the early age of fifteen, like others\r\nwhose fortunes I have recorded, he left his native country to seek\r\nforeign military service, and in 1757 was appointed a Sub-Lieutenant of\r\nthe Irish Brigade in the French service, in the battalion known as the\r\nInfantry regiment of O'Brien, or Lord Clare, and which bore the title\r\nof Clare until its dissolution, thirty-five years after.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding year war had been declared between France and Britain\r\nrespecting their mutual territorial claims in North America. The former\r\nprepared a vast military armament to carry on the strife; and in the\r\narmy formed on the 12th July, 1759, to be led by the Maréchal Princes\r\nof Condé and Soubise, were the _Irish_ and _Scottish_ Brigades; and\r\nin the former was the Regiment of Clare, with which young O'Connell\r\nwas serving as a subaltern. From this period, for some time, little is\r\nknown of him, save that he served throughout the Seven Years' War, and\r\nat its close, for his good conduct, was promoted into a new corps which\r\nhad recently been embodied.\r\n\r\nIn 1779, when France espoused the cause of America, and sought to\r\nharass the mother country in Europe, O'Connell was engaged in the\r\nexpedition against Portmahon, which is the principal town in Minorca,\r\nsituated on a rocky promontory, difficult of access from the landward,\r\nand defended by Fort San Philipo, in which there was a resolute\r\ngarrison. O'Connell, with his new regiment, served under the Duc de\r\nCrillon at the siege, and conducted himself with such honour as to be\r\nspecially noticed. The operations were severe and protracted, but in\r\nthree years the Spaniards and their allies recaptured the whole island\r\nof Minorca, which at the peace of 1763 had been formally ceded to\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nIn 1782, O'Connell served with the combined French and Spanish\r\narmament which blockaded Gibraltar, during that memorable siege which\r\nhad commenced on the 12th of January in the preceding year. Having\r\nshown considerable skill as an engineer at Minorca, he was one of the\r\ncouncil-of-war appointed to assist the Chevalier d'Arcon in conducting\r\nthe grand attempt in which France and Spain had resolved to try their\r\nfull strength for the capture of that celebrated rock, the key of\r\nthe Mediterranean; and for this purpose, as already related in the\r\nmemoir of the Lacys, 40,000 soldiers, with 200 pieces of cannon and\r\n80 mortars, pressed the attack by land, while 47 sail of the line,\r\n10 battering ships, and a multitude of frigates, mounting 1000 guns\r\nand having 12,000 chosen soldiers added to their crews, lay before\r\nthe fortress by sea--and in that fortress, to meet all this warlike\r\npreparation, were only 7000 British soldiers!\r\n\r\nThe French army was commanded by Louis Duc de Crillon-Mahon, the\r\nrepresentative of an ancient noble family in the Vaucluse, who had\r\ncommenced his military career in the Grey musketeers, and served under\r\nMarshal Villars in Italy. He had direction of the whole attack; his\r\nengineers were the most expert in Europe, and brave volunteers came\r\nfrom all quarters to take part in a siege which attracted the attention\r\nand raised the expectation of all Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the council-of-war, O'Connell repeatedly opposed the\r\nplans of the Duc de Crillon and of the Chevalier d'Arcon, and declared\r\ntheir system of attack \"worthless;\" and the sequel, in the triumph of\r\nGeneral Elliot, proved that his observations were correct.\r\n\r\nIn the grand attack he accepted command of one of the floating\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nTen of these, mounting from ten to twenty-eight guns, had been built\r\nunder the orders of M. d'Arcon. Their bottoms were of solid timber,\r\ntheir sides were sheathed with wetted cork, and filled with damp sand\r\nbetween the timbers. They had sloping roofs of raw hides and net--work\r\nto receive the bombs, which thus exploded harmlessly over the heads of\r\nthe besiegers. These floating batteries were exposed during the whole\r\ntime to that terrible fire of red-hot shot--a suggestion of General\r\nBoyd--which ultimately, by firing the great ship of Buenaventura de\r\nMoreno, struck the Spaniards with confusion and dismay.\r\n\r\nO'Connell had one of his ears torn off by a cannon-ball; and by the\r\nexplosion of a shell, which by its weight penetrated the roof of skins,\r\nhe was covered with wounds and bruises of minor importance.\r\n\r\nHis services, during this futile and disastrous siege, were considered\r\nso valuable by the King of France, that, on the recommendation of the\r\nDuc de Crillon, he was rewarded with the colonelcy of the Regiment de\r\nSalm-Salm; a German corps raised in the principality of that name; but\r\nthis post he held for a short period, being removed to the regiment of\r\nRoyal Swedish Infantry.\r\n\r\nAfter this, in 1787, the government of France having resolved that the\r\nmilitary economy of their army should undergo a complete revision and\r\nremodelling, appointed a military board, consisting of four generals\r\nand _one_ colonel to prepare reports and recommend alterations where\r\nnecessary. The colonel chosen was O'Connell, who drew up a system of\r\nregimental economy, and a code of tactics, which were afterwards used\r\nwith brilliant success against himself and his loyal comrades during\r\nthe first campaigns of the revolution. When the labours of the board\r\nceased, he was appointed to the onerous situation of Inspector-General\r\nof Infantry, with the duty of regulating the new uniforms and equipment\r\nof the Line, when many alterations and improvements were adopted in\r\n1791.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded as colonel of the Swedish regiment by Count Pherson,\r\nafterwards one of the principal agents in the escape of Louis XVI. from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nO'Connell now enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most\r\ndistinguished officers in France.\r\n\r\nBesides his very extensive knowledge of mathematics and military\r\nstrategy, says a French writer, he was well versed in the study of\r\nlanguages; and although Latin and Greek were to him alike familiar,\r\nhe spoke with equal fluency French, English, Italian, and German. He\r\nhad conceived a great predilection for the Erse (_gallique_) of the\r\nmountains of Kerry, and he was never more happy than when he could\r\nconverse in this dear old idiom, of which he could so well appreciate\r\nthe beauties.[20]\r\n\r\nNow came the fatal, the culminating, point of the once splendid\r\nmonarchy of France--the dark days of the Revolution; of the captivity\r\nand death of the weak, but unhappy Louis; of the flight or destruction\r\nof his nobles. Before the final catastrophe of the royal execution, a\r\nproposal was made by the National Assembly, which deeply interested\r\nCount O'Connell and others who had made France the land of their\r\nadoption. This was the intended expulsion from her soil of all\r\nforeign officers and soldiers who had served King Louis, including\r\nIrish, Scots, and Switzers. While this ungenerous measure was being\r\ndebated, the gallant Duke of Fitzjames, in February, 1791, addressed\r\nto Louis XVI. a letter on behalf of the exiles; and this document is\r\nso remarkable in its tenor, that I may be pardoned in quoting from it\r\none or two paragraphs. After briefly and modestly stating the services\r\nrendered by his father and grandfather to the line of St. Louis, he\r\nthus advanced the claims of the Irish in France:--\r\n\r\n\"Sire, my grandfather came not alone into France! His brave companions\r\nare now mine, and the dearest friends of my heart! He was accompanied\r\nby Thirty Thousand Irishmen, who abandoned home, fortune, and honour\r\nto follow their unfortunate king. For the descendants of those brave\r\nmen, whom your ancestors deemed so worthy of protection because they\r\nhad been faithful to their sovereign, I now entreat the same bounty\r\nfrom the great-grandson of Louis XIV. It is reported that the National\r\nAssembly propose disbanding the Irish regiments as foreign troops. The\r\nblood they have shed in the cause of France ought to have procured\r\nthem the right of being denizens of that kingdom, even though their\r\ncapitulation had not entitled them to that privilege.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, permit me to lay at your Majesty's feet the ardent wish of\r\nthe Irish regiments, who are as much attached to France by gratitude\r\nas formerly they were to the _House of Stuart_ by love and duty. If\r\nthe Assembly now reject their services, they implore your Majesty's\r\n_recommendation_ to the prince of your family now reigning in Spain,\r\npresuming to assure you that the present will be worthy of being made\r\nby a King of France, and of being favourably received by a prince of\r\nyour royal race.\r\n\r\n\"Fidelity and valour are their titles to recommendation! Of the former\r\nthey expect an authentic testimonial from the French nation, as they\r\nhave never ONCE failed in their duty during a century, and wherever\r\nthey have fought their valour has been conspicuous in battle.\r\n\r\n\"Sire, I entreat you to listen to their request; for myself I ask no\r\ncompensation--for me there is none! The honour of commanding _them_\r\ncannot be repaid. It secures my glory, as to lead them against a foe\r\nensures immediate victory!\"\r\n\r\nBut this spirited and touching letter failed to stay the popular\r\nclamour against these military strangers in the sequel.\r\n\r\nIn July the Assembly decreed that the standards of the Irish, German,\r\nand Liegoise infantry should be the tri-colour, inscribed \"Discipline\r\nand obedience to the law;\" but when the princes, Monsieur of France (or\r\nComte de Provence) and Charles Philippe, the Count d'Artois, fled to\r\nCoblentz, the formal defection of several Irish officers hastened the\r\ndestruction of the old brigade of immortal memory; and with it, after\r\nthe 10th of August, disappeared the ancient Swiss, German, Italian,\r\nScottish, and Catalonian regiments of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nDuring the crumbling of that monarchy, O'Connell, though in secret\r\ncommunication with the princes at Coblentz, lingered in Paris until\r\nthe close of 1791, when that strange convention was held at Pilnitz\r\nbetween the Emperor Leopold and the Prussian king, who formed a league\r\nto invade France and remodel its government. In a letter from Pavia,\r\ndated 6th July, the Emperor had already openly avowed his intentions\r\nin this new war, and invited all European powers to co-operate with\r\nhim. At this crisis the French government proposed to place O'Connell\r\nat the head of one of their many armies levied to meet this European\r\ncombination; but the count, despite the earnest recommendations of\r\nCarnot and of his friend the celebrated General Dumouriez, declined;\r\nand then, unable to withstand the issue of the suspicions which this\r\nrefusal excited in Paris after the terrible 10th of August, 1792, when\r\nthe attack of the Tuileries and massacre of the Swiss took place,\r\nhe secretly left the city, and repairing to the princes, offered\r\nto them his sword and fealty at Coblentz; which, being within the\r\nPrussian frontier, became the head-quarters of all those emigrants\r\nand Prussian troops destined to form the army of the Prince of Conti,\r\nwho vainly hoped to restore the line of St. Louis to the throne of\r\nhis forefathers. His chief aid-de-camp was the Comte de Macarthy, an\r\nemigrant officer of distinction, a marshal-de-camp of horse in 1791.\r\n\r\nO'Connell, relinquishing his higher claims among the crowd of noble\r\napplicants for service, accepted the command of a regiment as colonel,\r\nand left nothing undone to improve its discipline and efficiency, for\r\nhis whole energies and enthusiasm were devoted to the reconstitution of\r\nthe French monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe first of the French troops to proffer their loyalty, on this\r\noccasion, were the Scottish and Irish soldiers of the old Regiment de\r\nBerwick. The depôt of this corps was then quartered at the strong town\r\nof Givet, on the frontiers of France, under the command of Sir Charles\r\nMacCarthy-Lyragh, who immediately marched his men to Coblentz, and\r\njoined the battalion. Sir Charles afterwards passed into the British\r\nservice, when he was made a Colonel and Governor of Senegal, where in\r\n1824 he fought a battle with the Ashantees, by whom he was slain and\r\nbeheaded. The loyalty of the Irish brigade met with a warm response\r\nfrom the fugitive princes. \"This offer,\" replied Monsieur to the\r\ndeputation who came to proffer fealty, \"will mitigate the sufferings\r\nof the king, who will receive from you with pleasure the same mark of\r\nfidelity which James II. received from your ancestors. This double\r\nepoch ought for ever to furnish a device for the Regiment de Berwick!\r\nIt will henceforth be seen upon your colours; every faithful subject\r\nwill there read his duty, and behold the model he ought to imitate.\"\r\n\r\n\"The colours of Berwick,\" added Charles Philippe the Comte d'Artois,\r\n\"are, and always will be, in the path to honour, and we will march at\r\ntheir head!\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe king perished, and then followed the campaign of 1793, a period\r\nmost disastrous to the emigrants; but amid all the slaughter and\r\nmerciless butchery, with which the republicans inspired the war--a\r\nwar, to maintain which, the fiery zeal of Carnot enrolled no less than\r\n_fourteen_ armies, mustering 1,400,000 men--O'Connell led his battalion\r\nwith honour to himself and to the cause he served, till all hope was\r\nlost, and then with others he fled to England in the beginning of 1794.\r\n\r\nAmong those condemned by Robespierre's tribunal in that year, were\r\ntwo distinguished officers of the Irish brigade--General O'Moran, who\r\ndefended Dunkirk against the Duke of York; and John O'Donoghue, General\r\nde Brigade in the Army of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nAt the same time were condemned, M. Murdoch, a Scotsman in the service\r\nof the Comte de Montmorin; and W. Newton, an English colonel of the\r\nDragoon Regiment de Liberté, and formerly an officer in the Russian\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIn reduced circumstances O'Connell reached London, where he resided\r\nfor a time in comparative obscurity; and where, for many reasons, his\r\nresidence was far from being a pleasant one. Still, undiscouraged by\r\nthe aspect of affairs in France, and by the numerous bloody defeats and\r\nmassacres sustained by the emigrant troops and other supporters of the\r\nBourbons, he took a warm interest in the attempts meditated in 1794;\r\nbut fresh conflicts seemed only to fire the zeal of the republicans\r\nanew, till the French armies, following their victories, drove their\r\nenemies across the Meuse and then beyond the Rhine; after which they\r\npenetrated into Holland, revolutionized it, and succeeded in detaching\r\nPrussia from its alliance with Britain.\r\n\r\nAt this epoch O'Connell laid before William Pitt the plan of a new\r\ncampaign, which so pleased that minister, that he made the count,\r\nthen in his fifty-second year, an offer of military service under the\r\nBritish government. This he at once accepted, and proposed to form\r\na new brigade to be named _the Irish_, and to be raised principally\r\nfrom remnants of the regiments of Clare, Lally, Dillon, Berwick, &c.,\r\nemigrant officers, and men who represented the old brigade of King\r\nJames; but here O'Connell's religion, which was strictly Catholic,\r\nprevented him, in those days of intolerance, prior to the Emancipation\r\nAct, attaining in the British service a higher rank than Colonel; and\r\nthis rank he held till the day of his death.\r\n\r\nThe brigade consisted of six battalions, each of the strength usual\r\non a war establishment; but O'Connell had the mortification to find\r\nhimself gazetted by the Horse Guards Colonel of the _fourth_ regiment\r\ninstead of the first, to which he was justly entitled, by his previous\r\nposition and general military character.\r\n\r\nHis commission was dated 1st October, 1794.[22]\r\n\r\nThe list of colonels was as follows:--\r\n\r\n1st Regiment--the Duke of Fitzjames.\r\n\r\n2nd Regiment--Anthony, Count Walsh de Serrant.\r\n\r\n3rd Regiment--Honourable Henry Dillon.\r\n\r\n4th Regiment--Count Daniel O'Connell.\r\n\r\n5th Regiment--Charles, Viscount Walsh de Serrant,\r\n\r\n6th Regiment--James Henry, Count Conway.[23]\r\n\r\nSeveral of his old friends were appointed to the corps; among these\r\nwere Bartholomew, Count O'Mahoney, Colonel, 1st January, 1801; John\r\nO'Toole, Colonel, 1805; and Colonel James O'Moore, who was appointed\r\nMajor-General in 1801.\r\n\r\nThis brigade, which was embodied under circumstances so singular,\r\ninstead of being sent to fight upon the continent of Europe, as\r\nO'Connell and his brother emigrants had fondly anticipated, after many\r\nchanges in its constitution and organization, was ordered to Nova\r\nScotia, to Cape Breton, and to the then pestilential West India Isles.\r\nThe snows of America and the burning sun of the tropics soon had a\r\nfatal effect upon these unfortunate wanderers, and they were nearly all\r\nswept away by disease and death.\r\n\r\nOf the six regiments, only thirty-four officers of all ranks were alive\r\nin 1818, on the Irish half-pay.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th December, 1797, O'Connell, weary of a service so heartless,\r\nand so little conducive to the welfare of the cause he loved so much,\r\nretired upon the full-pay of colonel unattached, and returned home.[24]\r\n\r\nIn 1802 he profited by the Treaty of Amiens, when peace was negotiated\r\nbetween Great Britain and France, to return to the latter; but the\r\nfrail bond of unity was soon broken, and he was comprehended in the\r\nharsh decree which seized, as prisoners of war, all British subjects\r\nremaining in France.\r\n\r\nAt the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814 he regained his liberty,\r\nand Louis XVIII. restored to him his rank of General, and with it the\r\nColonelcy of a regiment and the pension and Grand Cross of St. Louis,\r\nwhich he enjoyed with his retired full pay as a British Colonel. This\r\nwas after the decree of the 16th July, by which the whole of the old\r\narmy was disbanded, and the command conferred upon Marshal Macdonald,\r\nwho remodelled a new army from the wreck of Napoleon's veterans.\r\n\r\nO'Connell lived in tranquillity and honour, a remnant of other days\r\nand of old romantic sympathies, until 1830, when he was again deprived\r\nof his French emoluments for his unwavering fidelity to Charles X. and\r\nthe elder branch of the Bourbons. After this he retired to his château\r\nat Meudon, near Blois, where he died, on the 9th of July, 1833, in the\r\nninety-first year of his age, the oldest Colonel of the British army,\r\nand the senior general of the French.\r\n\r\nSuch was the chequered career of one of the last of the brave old Irish\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _Biographie Universelle._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Scots' Magazine_, 1791.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: War-Office Records--communicated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: War-Office Record.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHAL MACDONALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen James Joseph Macdonald, Marshal of France and Duke of Tarentum,\r\nwas the son of Neil MacEachin Macdonald (a gentleman sprung from the\r\nbranch of the Clanranald in Uist), who served in France as a lieutenant\r\nin the Scottish Regiment of Ogilvie, to which he had been appointed by\r\nthe recommendation of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, whom he had served\r\nbravely and loyally even after the close of his disastrous campaign\r\nin Scotland, and whom he had followed into exile after materially\r\ncontributing to that deliverance which was effected by the celebrated\r\nFlora Macdonald. He was one of the hundred and thirty Highlanders who\r\ngathered on the shore of Loch nan Uamh after the horrors of Culloden,\r\nand embarked with Prince Charles for France.\r\n\r\nNeil MacEachin (_i.e._, the son of Hugh) had been a preceptor in the\r\nfamily of his chief, Clanranald, and being originally designed for the\r\nCatholic Church, had been educated at the Scottish College in Paris.\r\nHe spoke French with great fluency, and to the exiled prince proved a\r\nfaithful adherent, friend, and solace, in all his wanderings; and when\r\nCharles was so ungenerously committed to a dungeon at Vincennes by\r\norder of the French government, his captivity was shared alone by the\r\nbrave islesman from Uist. According to Mr. Chambers, there is every\r\nreason to believe that he was the author of a little work entitled\r\n_Alexis_, in which he preserved a minute record of the prince's\r\nwanderings and dangers in the Western Isles of Scotland.\r\n\r\nHis son, the future Marshal of the Empire, was born on the 17th of\r\nNovember, 1765, in the old fortified town of Sedan, in the departement\r\nof the Ardennes.\r\n\r\nDestining him for the profession of arms, he had him educated with\r\nthe greatest care, and in his nineteenth year enrolled him as a cadet\r\nin the Legion of Maillebois, which was to enter Holland, and second a\r\nrevolution there--a movement neutralized by the influence of Prussia.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 young Macdonald was appointed a Sub-lieutenant in Dillon's\r\nRegiment, a battalion of the Irish Brigade, which now included in its\r\nrank many Scottish emigrants and their descendants; and in this corps\r\nhe remained a subaltern until the Revolution in 1792, when his colonel,\r\nthe brave, loyal, and unfortunate Dillon, was murdered at Lisle, where\r\nhis body was literally torn to pieces by the revolted soldiers and\r\ninfuriated mob.\r\n\r\nAlthough, like the 4th Hussars and the Regiment of Berwick, Dillon's\r\nbattalion emigrated entire and joined the fugitive French princes,\r\nMacdonald remained in France; _not_ because he did not share the\r\nloyal sentiments of his comrades, but because he loved the beautiful\r\nMademoiselle Jacob, whose father had joined the popular party against\r\nthe monarchy. This lady he afterwards married; and the influence of her\r\nfamily led him to embrace, or at least to adopt, the principles of the\r\nrevolutionists, while he avoided their crimes and excesses.\r\n\r\nThe new government soon discovered that Macdonald was a bold, active,\r\nand intelligent officer, and at once gave him employment. He made\r\nthe first campaign of the revolutionary war as Staff-major, under\r\nde Bournonville, and served afterwards in the same capacity with\r\nGeneral Dumourier, acquitting himself so much to the satisfaction of\r\nthese distinguished leaders, that, on the 1st of March, 1793, he was\r\nappointed Colonel of the Regiment de Picardie, the second regiment of\r\nthe old French line, which was then in garrison at Thionville; and this\r\nancient corps (which was originally raised by Charles IX. in 1562) he\r\ncommanded in the first campaign in Belgium.\r\n\r\nHe was sincerely attached to Dumourier; but, on the defection of that\r\ngeneral from the Republic, after his fruitless attempts on behalf\r\nof the king, his retreat to the camp at Maulde, and the attempt to\r\nassassinate him on the 5th April, Macdonald did not accompany him in\r\nhis flight to the Austrians, but remained with the army, in which\r\nhe was soon after named a General of Brigade. Under the celebrated\r\nPichegreu he served with this rank in the Army of the North against the\r\ncombined forces of Britain and Austria, and particularly signalized\r\nhimself at Werwick and Comines.\r\n\r\nThe column of Pichegreu consisted of fifty thousand men. It penetrated\r\nto Courtrai, which was surrendered by a garrison that found it\r\nindefensible. Macdonald was next at the investment of Menin on the Lys,\r\nwhere a formidable resistance was made. The battle before this place\r\nlasted from eight a.m., until four in the afternoon, when the Germans,\r\nwho had advanced to the relief, retired, and left Menin to its fate.\r\nA few months after saw all the Austrian Netherlands overrun by the\r\nvictorious French, and the allies who had come to protect the province\r\nretiring in disorder beyond the Meuse. On this retreat the British and\r\nHanoverians were particularly pressed by Macdonald, who followed them\r\ninto Holland.\r\n\r\nAt the passage of the Meuse a Scottish officer named Macdonald came to\r\nPichegreu's army with a flag of truce, and during the parley--\r\n\r\n\"You have,\" said he, \"among you a general of my name; we wish much to\r\ntake him prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a care, monsieur,\" replied a French officer, \"that he does not\r\ntake _you_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd next day this officer, with a party, was nearly captured by the\r\ncolumn of Macdonald.[25]\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Waal on the ice, under the heavy batteries of\r\nNimeguen, when leading the right wing of the Army of the North, was one\r\nof Macdonald's most brilliant achievements.\r\n\r\nAfter many desultory movements, the discomfited allies had taken up\r\na position beyond this river, which is a branch of the Rhine, and\r\ncontested the passage with the French during the severe winter of 1794.\r\nThe stream was a mass of ice, as the frost was unusually intense; thus\r\nthe sufferings of the soldiers were great.\r\n\r\nResolved to avail themselves of the advantage which these sufferings\r\ngave them, the French had made repeated attempts to force the passage\r\nof the river. On the night of the 26th December, when an unusual gloom\r\nhad settled over the frozen stream and snow-clad scenery, Pichegreu,\r\nwith all his forces, advanced towards the boundary with such rapidity\r\nthat he lost several cannon and soldiers. Next day he ventured on the\r\nice and the swamps that bordered it, making a general assault upon the\r\nposts of the allies. Macdonald, with the right wing, pushed boldly\r\nbetween Fort St. Andre and the walls and batteries of the ancient town\r\nof Nimeguen, in which there lay a strong garrison. His orders were \"to\r\nact as an army of observation, and prevent the British and Germans from\r\nsupporting the Dutch, as the main attacks were to be made by the left\r\nand centre.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter, numbering 16,000 bayonets, crossed the Meuse in three\r\ncolumns, near the village of Driel, and invested Fort St. Andre and the\r\nfortifications in the Isle of Bommel; while Macdonald achieved with\r\nsignal success the passage elsewhere, and formed his battalions in\r\nposition beyond the frozen stream. Taken by surprise, the inert Dutch\r\nsoldiers in the Bommeler-waard made but a show of resistance. They were\r\ndriven out by the charged bayonet, and 600 of them were captured.\r\n\r\nThe French left wing advanced towards Breda with equal success, and\r\nstormed the lines between that city and Gertrudenberg in Northern\r\nBrabant; forced the entrenchments at Capellan in Gueldreland, and\r\nstormed Waspick. In this series of reverses the allied British, Dutch,\r\nand Austrians lost one hundred pieces of cannon, and had more than\r\na thousand prisoners taken; while the French securely established\r\nthemselves far beyond the contested river. Ere long all resistance to\r\ntheir progress ceased; every fortress, city, and castle submitted to\r\nthem in succession, till the desperation of his affairs compelled the\r\nStadtholder to seek refuge in Britain, while his allies retreated by\r\nthe way of Amersfort to cross the Issel, abandoning Holland to its\r\nfate, and to the armies of Pichegreu and Macdonald.\r\n\r\nFor his services in this campaign the latter was now made a General of\r\nDivision. Every officer under whom he served mentioned him with honour\r\nin their reports to the Directory; but while, with that openness which\r\nis characteristic of soldiers, his comrades thus rendered every justice\r\nand tribute to his worth and bravery, the suspicious representatives\r\nof the people, who followed the Army of the North, and thrust their\r\nofficious counsels upon its generals, occasioned him constant anxiety.\r\nTheir dislike of his Scottish name was never concealed, and his natural\r\nfrankness unfortunately laid him but too open to their insidious\r\nattacks; till ultimately their animosity was gratified by the Directory\r\n_depriving_ him of his command. Of this injustice Pichegreu complained\r\nbitterly, and said, \"My army will soon become disorganized, if thus\r\nwantonly deprived of its best officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have dismissed Macdonald,\" was the coarse reply of the Deputy St.\r\nJust, \"because neither his _face_ nor his _name_ are republican; but\r\nwe will restore him, Pichegreu, to thee, and with thy head shalt thou\r\nanswer for him.\"\r\n\r\nThis opinion of the Committee of Public Safety so far influenced the\r\nDirectory, that, until he replaced Championnet in Italy, Macdonald\r\nwas never entrusted with an independent command. Soon after this\r\nmortification in Holland, the convention for a peace between France\r\nand Austria was held at Leoben, and on its conclusion he repaired to\r\nCologne, and, quitting the army of the Rhine, joined that of Italy,\r\nwhere the bright star of Napoleon was now in the ascendant. By the\r\nnature of his frontier service Macdonald had hitherto little or no\r\ncorrespondence with the future Emperor, who having also imbibed the\r\nsuspicions of the Directory, was long in discovering the worth or\r\nrelying on the fidelity of the only Scottish soldier in his service.\r\nMacdonald appeared in Italy too late to bear any part in the first\r\nevents of the campaign of 1797, when the armies of the aggressive\r\nrepublic marched to spread their new political principles throughout\r\nthe Italian peninsula; but in the following year he was at the invasion\r\nof the Papal States, with the terrible Massena and with Berthier, who\r\nproclaimed the republic at Rome, on which the Pope fled to Florence.\r\nOne of the early measures of the French generals was the suppression\r\nof the English, Scottish, and Irish colleges, all the effects in which\r\nwere seized and the students dispersed.\r\n\r\nTo the Pope they sent a tricoloured cockade and the offer of a pension,\r\nto which he made the following reply:--\r\n\r\n\"I acknowledge no uniform save that with which the Church has adorned\r\nme. My life is at your disposal, but my soul is beyond your power.\r\nI cannot be ignorant of the hand whence the scourge proceeds which\r\nchastises the sheep and afflicts the pastor for the errors of his\r\nflock; but I submit to the Divine will. Your pension I need not.\r\nA staff and scrip are sufficient for an old man who must pass the\r\nremainder of his days in sackcloth and ashes. Rob, pillage, burn as\r\nyou please, and destroy the monuments of antiquity, _but religion you\r\ncannot destroy_: it will, in defiance of your efforts, exist to the end\r\nof time!\"\r\n\r\nMacdonald's Scottish surname was a puzzle to the Italians, who styled\r\nhim Maldonaldo, Mardona, and every possible variety of the original.\r\nAfter occupying the States of the Church, and leaving Macdonald with\r\nhis corps to overawe them, the French armies, whose line of march\r\nwas everywhere marked by flames, plunder, and barbarity, advanced\r\ninto Naples to expel the old Bourbon king, and erect an affiliated\r\nrepublic on the ruins of his throne. On this service our hero\r\ncommanded under Championnet. Prior to this he had been charged with\r\nthe duty of repressing the insurrections which broke out among the\r\nRomans, who massacred or assassinated the French soldiers whenever an\r\nopportunity of doing so occurred. The most serious of these risings\r\nwas at Froisinone, a village in the valley of the Apennines. This\r\nhe suppressed with great severity, and, to strike terror into the\r\npeasantry, shot all prisoners taken in arms. The barbarities of the\r\nFrench, during their brief ascendency, are still remembered with horror\r\nin Italy. They and their partisans hunted and destroyed the Neapolitan\r\nroyalists like wild beasts, and made a desert of all Apulia. It was\r\nin this province that Ettore Caraffa, Conti di Ruvo, and heir of the\r\nDuke of Andria, joined the invaders of his native country, and, after\r\nstorming and reducing to ashes Andria, a prosperous and populous city\r\nin the province of Bari, he was so extolled by the Directory for his\r\ngenerous republicanism, that \"when General Broussier carried the\r\ntown of Trani by storm, Caraffa recommended that it should be burned\r\nalso--and burned it was, with nearly all that were in it--the wounded\r\nand the dead, with those that were living and unhurt. They made, in\r\nfact, a hell of all that smiling Adriatic coast long before Cardinal\r\nRuffo had passed the first defile in the Calabrias.\"\r\n\r\nAt Froisinone the Roman insurgents murdered the son of the Consul\r\nMathei merely because his father was at the head of the new government.\r\nMacdonald offered from fifty to five hundred piastres for the chiefs of\r\nthe insurrection, dead or alive. He issued a proclamation to the Romans\r\ninviting them to obedience and respect for the new authorities put over\r\nthem, as being the only means of raising the Roman Republic to the rank\r\nshe should occupy; and he concludes thus: \"The great nation wills it\r\nso, and its will must be executed.--Macdonald.\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1798, as Commander-in-chief of the Roman territory,\r\nhe ordained the Consulate to raise two regiments of horse and a\r\nbattalion of infantry in each department.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Naples had now been subverted; under the protection of a\r\nBritish fleet and army, the king retired to Sicily, and a republic was\r\nsupposed to be quietly established at the extremity of the peninsula,\r\nwhen the brave Calabrese, a race of hardy mountaineers, who were living\r\nin wild places in all the simple civilization of three centuries ago,\r\nrose in arms, and, uniting with the Apulians from the plains, poured\r\nagainst the French in tumultuary hordes--half robbers and wholly\r\npatriots. Then began a war of torture and extermination. These new\r\ninsurgents demanded a general from their foolish and feeble king; but,\r\ninstead of a soldier, he sent them a priest--a man of peace to oppose\r\narmies led by such men as Championnet, Macdonald, Berthier, and Massena!\r\n\r\nThis was the celebrated Cardinal Ruffo, a descendant of the ancient\r\nprinces of Ruffo-Scilla, whose now ruined castle crowns that rock so\r\nfamed in ancient story, and opposite to the fabled whirlpool upon the\r\nSicilian shore. In a remote corner of Calabria he unfurled the banner\r\nof Bourbon, with the cry of \"Viva Ferdinand and our Holy Faith!\"\r\n\r\nThis brought to the muster-place thousands, who swore upon their\r\nknives, daggers, crosses, and relics, to clear their native land of\r\nthose lawless Jacobins and infidel republicans who were violating\r\nand desecrating everything, whether sacred or profane. The mountain\r\nrobbers, who knew well the secret passes of that romantic and beautiful\r\ncountry--men who under their own government had subsisted by rapine\r\nand slaughter, led the van of the new movement. The cardinal cared\r\nlittle for the morals of his followers. Provided they were stanch,\r\nbrave, good marksmen, and well armed, he received them all with an\r\napostolical benediction, and left the rest to Providence and gunpowder.\r\nHe marched at their head direct for Naples, where the French army under\r\nChampionnet was cantoned; and, as he advanced, his wild and tumultuary\r\narmy was increased, in every town and valley through which he marched,\r\nby sturdy peasants armed with muskets, daggers, and weapons of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe fury with which these irregular hordes, clad in their picturesque\r\ncostume, their Italian hats, and shaggy zammaras, assailed Championnet\r\nat Naples, with the advance of another column under General Mack from\r\nanother point, forced Macdonald to march with his division, four\r\nthousand strong, from Rome, and retire to Ottricoli, a small town on\r\na hill near the Tiber, about thirty-six miles distant. He left a\r\ngarrison in the Castle of St. Angelo, which was summoned by Mack to\r\nsurrender. He sent a copy of this document, which was imperious in its\r\ntenor, to General Championnet, who empowered Macdonald to reply, which\r\nhe did in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n Head-quarters, Monterozi, 29th November, 1798.\r\n\r\n \"The Commander-in-chief, sir, has sufficient confidence in me to\r\n recognise as his own the reply which I make to your letter of the 28th\r\n November. I well know that he has not given any answer to your letters\r\n concerning the evacuation of the forts and strong places; and one of\r\n these, we consider the Castle of St. Angelo. The silence of contempt\r\n alone was due to your insolent menaces on this subject, and this was\r\n the only answer that could be expected consistently with the dignity\r\n of the French name. You mention a regard for treaties, and yet you\r\n invade the territory of a Republic in alliance with France, and do so\r\n without provocation, and without its having given you the least reason\r\n for such conduct.\r\n\r\n \"You have attacked the French troops, who trusted in the most sacred\r\n defences--the law of nations and the security of treaties.\r\n\r\n \"You have shot at our flags of truce which were proceeding from Tivoli\r\n to Vicavero, and you have made the French garrison at Rieti prisoners\r\n of war.\r\n\r\n \"You have attacked our troops on the heights of Terni, and yet you do\r\n not call that a declaration of war!\r\n\r\n \"Force alone, sir, constrained us to retire from Rome (and you, sir,\r\n know better than any one the truth of what I say), that the conquerors\r\n of Europe will avenge such proceedings! At present, I confine myself\r\n merely to stating our injuries; the French army will do the rest. I\r\n declare to you, sir, that I place our sick, Valville the commissary\r\n of war, and the other Frenchmen who have remained at Rome, under\r\n the care of all the soldiers whom you command. If a hair of their\r\n heads be touched, it shall be a signal for _the death of the whole\r\n Neapolitan army_! The French Republican soldiers are not assassins;\r\n but the Neapolitan generals, the officers and soldiers who were\r\n taken prisoners of war, on the day before yesterday, on the heights\r\n of Terni, shall answer with their heads for the safety of my wounded.\r\n Your summons to the commander of Fort St. Angelo is of such a nature,\r\n that I have made it public, in order to add to the indignation and to\r\n the horror which your threats inspire, and which we despise as much as\r\n we think there is little to be dreaded from them.\r\n\r\n \"Macdonald.\"\r\n\r\nIn his position at Civita Castellana, near Ottricoli, he was attacked\r\nby Mack with great determination. Championnet, in his despatch,\r\nstates that the enemy were forty thousand strong, and advanced in\r\nfive columns. \"General Macdonald, surrounded on all sides, gave proof\r\nof his great talents. He received the attack with that courage which\r\ndistinguishes the man of firm character, and by his able dispositions\r\nentirely disconcerted the enemy.\" His advanced guard, under Kellerman,\r\nconsisted only of three squadrons of the 19th chasseurs à cheval,\r\nthe first battalion of the 11th regiment, and two pieces of flying\r\nartillery. This handful of brave fellows routed Mack's first column,\r\nslew four hundred, and took fifteen pieces of cannon, fifty caissons,\r\nand two thousand prisoners, while they had but _thirty_ killed.\r\n\r\nThe Italians of De Mert retired to the heights of Calvi, a steep\r\nmountain range, where, after a midnight march, during a severe December\r\nstorm, Macdonald surrounded and attacked them a few days after, and by\r\na flag of truce summoned them to capitulate. To this they made some\r\nridiculous propositions, but he sent the following ultimatum:--\r\n\r\n\"The column shall surrender prisoners at discretion, or be put to the\r\nsword!\"\r\n\r\nOn this they surrendered at once to the number of five thousand, with\r\nall their arms, fifteen standards, eight guns, and three hundred\r\nhorses. Among the prisoners were the Marshal De Mert and Don Carello.\r\nAfter this, he returned to Rome, re-established the Republic, and then\r\ntaking the route to Capua, followed Mack's Neapolitans, who fled\r\nbefore him. Mack was an Austrian general who had entered the service of\r\nFerdinand of Naples to organize the patriots. For this purpose he had\r\nbrought with him from Vienna fourteen experienced officers.\r\n\r\nOn the march to Capua Macdonald's soldiers suffered greatly from the\r\nconstant rain and storms of snow, by the overflow of the mountain\r\ntorrents, the destruction of all the bridges, and by the rifles of the\r\narmed peasantry, who mercilessly slew every straggler. The bravest men\r\nin the Neapolitan army were the mountain banditti; and many of these\r\nromantic desperadoes, who led armed bands, received the commission of\r\ncolonel, and were decorated with knightly orders.\r\n\r\nFra Diavolo, a brigand by profession, was a colonel in the infantry,\r\nand cavaliere of San Constantino; the Abate Proni, a ferocious monk\r\nof the Abruzzi; Gaetano Mammone, a miller from Sora; and Benedetto\r\nMangone--three outlaws and brigands, covered themselves with\r\ndistinction in this horrible war against the French; but Benedetto was\r\na veritable monster. \"He never spared the life of a Frenchman who fell\r\ninto his power; and it is said that he butchered with his own hand\r\nfour hundred Frenchmen and Neapolitan republicans; and that it was his\r\ncustom to have a human head placed upon the table when he dined, as\r\nother people would have a vase of flowers.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1799, a picquet of sixty Polish soldiers was captured between\r\nCapua and Fondi by the Calabrese, who put every one of them to death.\r\nIn the Campagna Frenchmen were roasted alive by the peasantry, or tied\r\nnaked to trees and left to be devoured by dogs and wolves. Stragglers\r\nwere destroyed by every means barbarity could devise.\r\n\r\nThe King of Naples, who had come from Sicily, fled again; and General\r\nMack, before he was blocked up in Capua, wrote in these terms:--\r\n\r\n\"Sire, of forty thousand men with whom I entered the Roman territory,\r\nonly twelve thousand remain; and, of these, many are going over daily\r\nto the French.\"\r\n\r\nMacdonald, with Championnet, laid siege to Capua, where Mack made\r\na vigorous resistance and repulsed them; but the attack was renewed\r\nwith fresh fury; the city was won by assault, and the remains of the\r\nNeapolitan army, who had gathered courage from despair, and whom shame\r\nfor past defeats inspired with a glow of double vengeance, perished\r\nunder the bayonets of the French. Their bodies choked the bed of the\r\nVolturno; and for six leagues from thence the road to Naples was\r\nstrewed with their dead and dying, till even the conquerors grew tired\r\nof slaughter. When Mack yielded himself a prisoner of war to the\r\nGeneral of Division, he proffered his sword, a handsome weapon, which\r\nhad been presented to him by the King of Great Britain in 1795.\r\n\r\nChampionnet laughed, and returned it to him, saying--\r\n\r\n\"Keep your sword, M. le General, the laws of the Republic prohibit the\r\nuse of British manufactures.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time the rage of the French army against their peculating\r\ncommissaries was great, for they had suffered severely by the scarcity\r\nof provisions; but Championnet and Macdonald skilfully turned this\r\ndiscontent against the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers,\" they exclaimed, after the fall of Capua, \"your magazines\r\nare at Naples!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us march, then--to Naples lead us!\" was the reply, and to the\r\ncapital the fugitives of Mack's army were pursued. A dreadful slaughter\r\nwas made among the Lazzaroni, for a fresh struggle ensued at Naples,\r\nand every house from which the troops were fired on was burned to the\r\nground, and its inmates bayoneted.\r\n\r\nMacdonald had distinguished himself in every engagement with the\r\nunfortunate Mack; but now a series of disputes ensued between him\r\nand Championnet, who had many troubles to contend with. Irritated by\r\nthe devastations committed by the Sieur Faitpoult, Commissary of the\r\nDirectory, the general commanding ordered him to quit Naples, with his\r\nhorde of plunderers, within twenty-four hours. Faitpoult, instead of\r\nobeying, raised the standard of mutiny against Championnet, but was\r\nforced to retire.\r\n\r\nThe coarse reproaches of the Deputy St. Just still rankled in the\r\nmemory of Macdonald, who left nothing undone to gain the confidence\r\nof the Directory, and persuade the members of it that he respected\r\ntheir authority, while it is but too probable that he despised them in\r\nhis heart. The Sieur Faitpoult had friends in the Directory; thus the\r\nfirmness of Championnet in expelling him from Naples was styled mutiny\r\nto the Republic, and he was ordered to quit the peninsula, and resign\r\nhis command to General Macdonald. Poor Championnet was placed under\r\narrest; and, relinquishing his bâton to his more fortunate second in\r\ncommand, had to appear before a court-martial at Turin.\r\n\r\nWith confidence Macdonald accepted this new position, which was one\r\nof great difficulty; for the revolted state of Naples, and, above\r\nall, the turbulence and ferocity of the Lazzaroni, were sources of\r\nincessant alarm. To travel, or pass from town to town, without an armed\r\nescort, was at that time impossible; fighting, skirmishing, solitary\r\nassassinations, and wholesale massacres, were of daily occurrence,\r\nparticularly in the province of Otranto, where the embers of revolt\r\nwere still fanned by the presence of the brave old Cardinal Ruffo,\r\nwho appeared at the head of his followers, clad in full pontificals,\r\nwearing his scarlet hat, and carrying his pastoral staff surmounted\r\nby a cross; and thus attired, in a sacred costume so well calculated\r\nto rouse the enthusiasm of Italians to frenzy, he led them to battle.\r\nThus he gave them his benediction before it, and thus he said mass for\r\nthe souls of those dead braves who died for \"Ferdinand and the Holy\r\nFaith;\" thus attired, at many a siege, he sprinkled the battering guns,\r\nlike his drums and banners, with holy water, mingling, as it were, the\r\nsmoke of the censer with the smoke of battle. Though the fiery spirit\r\nthus roused was restless and abroad, Macdonald ultimately forced the\r\nwhole kingdom to submit, and completely mastered the capital, which he\r\ngoverned with firmness and moderation.\r\n\r\nHis order of the day, issued on the 4th March, 1799, amply details\r\nthe many dangers which surrounded him, and the wise measures he took\r\nto guard against them. He threatened to make the clergy responsible\r\nfor the violence of the populace; but concluded by declaring his\r\nreverence for, and attachment to, religion, and his determination to\r\nprotect all pastors and magistrates who conformed to the laws of the\r\nnew republic. Five days after this, being informed that King Ferdinand\r\nhad an intention of landing again, he published a proclamation, in\r\nwhich he somewhat oddly invited the people of Naples to rise against\r\ntheir native prince, and unite with France. Acting in concert with the\r\nCommissioner Abrial, he lowered the taxes levied on the people; and,\r\nfilled by a just admiration for the memory of Tasso, he saved from\r\ndestruction the poet's native town, Sorrento, on the southern side of\r\nthe Gulf of Naples, where an insurrection had taken place. After this,\r\nthe provisional government made him a rash and pompous offer of forty\r\nthousand auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nIn April, he generously released and sent to Captain Trowbridge,\r\na British officer and eleven seamen, who had been cast ashore at\r\nCastellamare, during a tempest. He had treated them with every kindness\r\nas his countrymen. They were the crew of a prize, the _Championnet_,\r\nprivateer.\r\n\r\nThe entire command of the army in Italy was now bestowed upon General\r\nSherer; and when that officer was defeated between the Lake of Garda\r\nand the Adige, on the 26th of March, he sent a despatch to Macdonald,\r\ndesiring him to form a junction with his troops in northern Italy\r\nby forced marches. On hearing of the battle near the Adige, the\r\nNeapolitans again rose in arms; and the massacres of the French by\r\nwandering bands were again of daily occurrence; but, in spite of every\r\nnatural and human obstacle, Macdonald effected the junction according\r\nto his orders. As his retreat from Naples would have been dangerous\r\nwithout an attempt to overawe the armed masses who hovered on the\r\nmountains, he attacked and took Lacava, Castella, and the gloomy\r\nlittle town of Avellino, before his departure. On the 26th May, he\r\nwas in Tuscany, and united with the divisions detached by General\r\nMoreau. There were not wanting those who blamed him for losing time\r\nin combining his force with that of Moreau; but those who did so were\r\nignorant of the nature of the country he had to traverse with his\r\ntrains of artillery and baggage.\r\n\r\n\"General Macdonald has been here since the 5th instant,\" says a French\r\nletter from Florence. \"We deem him the saviour of the French in Italy,\r\nand our confidence in him will not be disappointed. His army, which has\r\nadvanced by forced marches, assembled here yesterday. It is full of\r\nardour, and its zeal, which a few reverses have only fired anew, is a\r\nhappy presage in our favour.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th June, he attacked Modena, and in less than two hours\r\ndispersed the Austrian division of Count Hohenzollern, which was in\r\nposition upon the glacis of the place; and two thousand prisoners were\r\ntaken by his French grenadiers. In an account of this affair, General\r\nSarrazen, who led these grenadiers, mentions that when Macdonald was\r\npressing on with the infantry of the line against the _cavalry_, he\r\nsaid to him--\r\n\r\n\"Macdonald, I shall remain with my grenadiers, and think you had better\r\ndo the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not see, M. Sarrazen, that I have them all, as if caught in a\r\nmousetrap,\" replied the commander, joyously; and, when within a hundred\r\npaces of the Austrian horse, he required them to surrender.\r\n\r\n\"We yield,\" replied an officer, sheathing his sabre and riding\r\nconfidently forward. Macdonald continued to approach until within\r\npistol-shot of their line, when the treacherous German suddenly\r\nexclaimed, while unsheathing his weapon,--\r\n\r\n\"Draw sabres--charge!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself at full speed upon Macdonald, who was far from\r\nanticipating a movement so sudden, and, after receiving three\r\nsword-cuts on the head, was thrown from his horse covered with blood.\r\nThis was all done in a moment, and the German officer mingled with his\r\nsquadron, which instantly took to flight. They were, however, overtaken\r\nand captured, and their leader, a youth of eighteen, was slain.\r\nMacdonald was at first supposed to be dead, for he lay stunned on the\r\nground, having three deep wounds, with a contusion by the fall from his\r\nhorse; yet he was in his saddle, and at the head of his column on the\r\n17th, when the advanced guard of the Russians, under Suwarrow, forced\r\nthe French into position on the right bank of the Trebia, so celebrated\r\nfor the victory of Hannibal over the forces of the consul Sempronius;\r\nand there, on this classic ground, ensued one of the bloodiest battles\r\nof the Italian campaign.\r\n\r\nMacdonald had advanced by Reggio and Modena, to effect a junction with\r\nthe army of Moreau, or to relieve Mantua; but being without pontoons,\r\nhe found the passage of the Po impossible, as that river was swollen by\r\nrecent rains, and, moreover, was defended by General Kray, with 10,000\r\nirregulars, and twice that number of armed peasantry. On the 17th, his\r\nadvanced guard was at Placentia; next day, he attacked and repulsed\r\nGeneral Ott, near San Giovanni; but the advance of the Russians, under\r\nSuwarrow, changed the fortune of the field.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sarrazen states Macdonald's force at 40,000 strong; M. de Segur\r\ngives it at 28,000. On the bank of that stream, the most rapid and\r\nimpetuous in Cisalpine Gaul, the contest was fierce and desperate; but\r\nthe daring attempts of Macdonald to cross, at the head of his troops,\r\nwere repulsed.\r\n\r\n\"On the 18th and 19th,\" says a journal of the time, \"the battles were\r\nvery murderous. The French formed a square four men deep and fought\r\ndesperately, till a column of Russians passed the river up to their\r\nnecks in the water, broke through with the bayonet, and made a dreadful\r\ncarnage among them. On the whole, the French are supposed to have lost,\r\nsince the 11th instant, 15,000 men in killed, wounded, and prisoners.\r\nMacdonald himself has received two sabre-wounds from a Hungarian\r\nhussar. Among the prisoners taken are 4 generals and 700 officers. Our\r\nloss consists of 4000 men killed and wounded, and 400 prisoners; but\r\nthe latter were rescued in the pursuit, and 40 waggons with French\r\nwounded were taken at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nThe fury of the Russian advance threw Macdonald's centre into\r\nconfusion. Sabre in hand, he strove to enforce order under a heavy fire\r\nof cannon and musketry; but was swept away with the panic-stricken\r\nmass of the 5th regiment of light infantry, among whom he became\r\nentangled, and who were flying in disorder, abandoning their muskets,\r\nknapsacks, canteens, and blankets in their eagerness to escape. By them\r\nhe was hurried into the current of the Trebia, and narrowly escaped\r\nbeing drowned. This confusion was caused by a brilliant charge of 500\r\nCossacks, who rushed with their lances in the rest through a cloud of\r\ndust. A terrified French chasseur exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"The whole Russian cavalry are upon us--fly!\"\r\n\r\nThen it was that the 5th gave way, and the centre was broken, but still\r\nthe flanks fought desperately; and had the division of Moreau been in\r\nthe field, it must have been won for France; but on that day he was\r\nattempting to raise the siege of Tortosa. Three standards were laid at\r\nthe feet of Suwarrow.\r\n\r\nAt Trebia, according to M. de Segur, who once served on Macdonald's\r\nstaff, \"during three days of a battle, the most desperate in our\r\nannals, twenty-eight thousand French withstood fifty thousand Russians,\r\nheld the fortunes of the day in balance, and gave vainly to Moreau the\r\ntime to strike a blow for France. The victory remained finally with\r\nSuwarrow; but, in his astonishment, the rude Muscovite exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"One more such success, and we shall lose the Peninsula!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Macdonald had been deceived in his expectations; his army\r\nwas exhausted; he was severely wounded, and when it was necessary that\r\nhe should retire, a torrent of foes behind opposed his retreat. Beyond\r\nthis torrent, other foes awaited him. The courage of his soldiers\r\nfailed; _but_ he, calm and serene, encouraged them, saying,--\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer, for nothing is impossible to the brave!\"\r\n\r\nWith the remains of his shattered army he retired towards Tuscany\r\nand Bologna; and at Piacenza a great quantity of his ammunition and\r\nbaggage fell into the hands of his pursuers. In the Directory there\r\nwere men who now reproached him with having wished to gain a battle\r\nalone, or at least without the participation of Moreau; but it was by\r\nthe express command of that general, on whose part he fully expected\r\nassistance, that he attempted to force the passage of the Trebia, and\r\nbreak the left wing of the Austro-Russian army. Notwithstanding the\r\ndesperation of his circumstances, he was not without hopes of making\r\nanother stand; but, on being deserted by General Lahoz, a Cisalpiner,\r\nand his corps, which united with twenty thousand insurgents to gall his\r\nflight, Macdonald relinquished all idea of again giving battle, and\r\ncontinued his retreat towards the mountains of Genoa, followed by the\r\ntroops of Generals Ott, Klenau, Lahoz, and Count Hohenzollern, and by\r\nhordes of brigands and guerillas, who murdered his men on all hands,\r\nand massacred them in the mountain passes.\r\n\r\nWith a flag of truce, he sent an officer to the Austrian general Melas,\r\npraying that he would treat with mercy the wounded Frenchmen whom he\r\nhad been compelled to abandon in Piacenza.\r\n\r\n\"The request is needless,\" replied Melas; \"Austrian soldiers know too\r\nwell the duties of humanity to require such advice.\"\r\n\r\nWounds and fatigue had so severely impaired Macdonald's health, that he\r\nwas fain to ask Suwarrow's permission to visit the baths of Pisa. This,\r\nthe Russian with chivalry and courtesy granted at once; but, instead of\r\nvisiting the celebrated Bagni di Pisa, the general returned to France,\r\nrelinquishing the command of his column, after uniting it to the army\r\nof Moreau; and immediately on his arrival in Paris he was entrusted by\r\nNapoleon with the command at Versailles.\r\n\r\nBy this time the French had abandoned the whole coast of the Adriatic,\r\nand lost their conquests in Naples, where nothing remained of them but\r\nthe graves of the slain.\r\n\r\nDuring the past hostilities the domestic relations of the Republic\r\nhad not improved in character or in spirit; and the feeble condition\r\nof the Directory afforded an admirable path by which the ambition of\r\nNapoleon might lead to a newer and firmer form of government. Returning\r\nhastily from his unsuccessful Egyptian campaign, he had reached Paris;\r\nand entering at once into the schemes of Talleyrand and his friend\r\nSieyes, a military conspiracy was formed to remodel the Republic as a\r\nConsulate, of which _he_ should be the head. Whatever may have been\r\nthe motives, or secret ambitions, which led the military chiefs to\r\nrevolutionize France again, it cannot be denied that she benefited\r\nthereby; and the energy with which the essay was made, and the success\r\nit had, were a sure guarantee for the decision of future affairs.\r\n\r\nMacdonald was in command at Versailles while these plans were maturing,\r\nand when Napoleon arrived at the Palace of St. Cloud. Though not\r\nactually in the conspiracy, he was in the secret, and knew that\r\nopposition to Napoleon would neither be for the interests of France,\r\nthe army, or himself; thus he took the lead in the matter, and by\r\nsuddenly closing or dispersing the political club at Versailles, made\r\nthe inhabitants aware that he, at least, deemed the time had come,\r\n\"when a just administration should obliterate the horrors of the last\r\nfew years, and the fatal vacillation of the weak Directory.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th Brumaire, the attempt was to be made; and Napoleon,\r\naccompanied by Macdonald, De Bournouville, and Moreau, inspected in the\r\ngardens of the Tuileries ten thousand chosen soldiers on whose faith\r\nthey could depend, and there Augereau, the future Duke of Castiglione,\r\njoined them.\r\n\r\n\"M. le Général,\" said he, embracing Napoleon, \"you have not called for\r\n_me_, but I have come to join you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome,\" replied Napoleon.\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous task they had undertaken, to overthrow the political\r\nincubus that had pressed so long upon France; and while the startled\r\nDirectory, who had already discovered the designs of those without,\r\nwere debating about their own safety, and while Moulins urged that\r\na battalion should be sent to seize Napoleon, the latter suddenly\r\nappeared, sword in hand, at the door of the hall, and entered with his\r\ngrenadiers, three deep, at a time when the projected Consulate was\r\nbeing discussed by some of the Directory with very little chance of\r\nsuccess. He decided the matter at once, by ordering his drummers to\r\nbeat a _pas de charge_, and by dismissing the judges with a promptitude\r\nworthy of Cromwell, and with a courage which evinced that, on his part,\r\nnothing would be wanting to retain the power he had won.\r\n\r\nWhen an army was formed for the re-conquest of Naples, in 1800,\r\nNapoleon offered Macdonald the command of the _corps de reserve_. He\r\ndid this to testify his pleasure for his adherence to the revolution\r\nof the 18th Brumaire; but the general, who felt piqued by the offer\r\nof a command so subordinate, in a country where he had before led an\r\narmy, urged illness and wounds as a reason for remaining in France.\r\nThe penetration of Napoleon, was too keen for the true sentiments\r\nof Macdonald to escape him; thus on the 24th of August, in the same\r\nyear, he was appointed to command the army of Switzerland, which was\r\ndestined to penetrate into the Tyrol, to second the operations of the\r\narmy of Italy and favour the columns of Moreau (who was then warring in\r\nGermany) by compelling the Austrians to employ at least thirty thousand\r\nof their best men among the Tyrolean mountains--the bulwark of the\r\nGerman empire.\r\n\r\nMacdonald marched from Bearn in September, with forty thousand men,[26]\r\ntowards Helvetia, accompanied by General Matthew Dumas, chief of the\r\nstaff, a soldier who used his pen better than his sword. His first\r\ndesire was that a corps of Helvetians should be formed to co-operate\r\nwith the French against the Austrians; but this request the Swiss\r\ngovernment declined; and he soon found his campaign to consist of a\r\nseries of arduous marches among the mountains, where, as the season\r\nadvanced and the winter drew on, his soldiers endured every misery\r\nthat, toil, hunger, and cold could inflict.\r\n\r\nIn the passage of the Alps, when one of his columns, composed of the\r\n80th Regiment, with some cavalry, artillery, sappers, and guides,\r\nunder Laboissière, attempted to cross the Splugen, in the country\r\nof the Grisons, a dreadful avalanche suddenly came thundering down\r\nfrom the mountains to bar their march, and swept forty-two of the\r\n10th Dragoons, with their horses, over a precipice. His other columns\r\nmet with equal difficulties. A letter in the Paris papers, dated\r\n\"Head-quarters, Chicavenna, 7th December, 1800,\" relates:--\r\n\r\n\"It was necessary to traverse the Splugen and Mount Carduiet. These\r\nmountains, even in July, present all the horrors of winter; judge what\r\nthey are in December! Threatening and inaccessible rocks, seas of snow\r\non all sides, torrents of avalanches falling with a noise equally\r\nterrible. Since our first march, two hundred men, with their horses,\r\nhave been swallowed up. After unheard-of labour, we succeeded in\r\ndisengaging all of them except three. There was not the least trace of\r\na road; but by labour and constancy we opened a narrow path, bordered\r\nby precipices which the eye could not fathom nor the foot always avoid.\"\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the pass, which leads towards Como had been traversed,\r\nthe troops in front, with muskets slung, digging a path for their\r\ncomrades in the rear, till the column, exhausted by cold and fatigue,\r\nbegan to retire without orders, though the dangers behind--snow,\r\nhunger, and avalanches--were the same as those in front. Macdonald\r\ngalloped towards his sinking soldiers, and his presence had an\r\nimmediate effect on them. They halted; he entreated and threatened; but\r\nthey listened in sullen silence.\r\n\r\nThen he dismounted, seized a shovel, and proceeded to dig the snow,\r\nexclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"My comrades, I would rather perish in the abyss than stoop to turn my\r\nsteps on perils such as these!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vive M. le Général!\" cried the soldiers of the 80th. Confidence was\r\ninspired anew; again the muskets were slung, the shovels resumed, and\r\nafter three days of labour, danger, and toil, the passage was achieved,\r\nand the troops of Macdonald debouched from that terrible gorge, where\r\nthe frozen precipices seemed to hang from heaven, and where whirlwinds\r\nof hail, tempests of snow, with death in its most frightful form, had\r\nbeen encountered.\r\n\r\nThe resistance he experienced from the Austrian troops was trivial; and\r\non the 7th of January, 1801, he made himself master of the circle and\r\ncity of Trent; but the armistice concluded at Treviso on the 16th of\r\nthe same month put an end to the war. After this he remained for some\r\ntime at Isola, suffering from an illness caused by the fatigues he had\r\nundergone at Splugen, and Delmas commanded in the interim.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the campaign he returned to Paris, where his opposition\r\nto some of the arbitrary measures of the First Consul made that haughty\r\npersonage resolve on politely getting rid of a troublesome mentor,\r\nby sending him on a distant mission. He was accordingly dispatched\r\nto Denmark, as Minister Plenipotentiary from France to the Court\r\nof Christian VII. There he resided for three years, and there he\r\nencountered so many disagreeables, as his presence was unwelcome in\r\nCopenhagen, that he frequently solicited his recall; but Napoleon was\r\njealous of Moreau, who was Macdonald's chief friend: thus he was only\r\nrecalled when the First Consul was about to exchange the consular staff\r\nfor an imperial sceptre.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the famous conspiracy of General Pichegreu\r\nand Georges Cadoudal, and their correspondence with the Prince of\r\nCondé, were discovered. In that correspondence Moreau was compromised\r\nto a dangerous extent; thus his friend Macdonald was received with\r\ngreater coldness at the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nThe high indignation which he had the temerity to express after the\r\nmock trial and banishment of his brother soldier Moreau, who fled to\r\nAmerica, completed the displeasure of the new Emperor, who withdrew all\r\ncountenance from Macdonald, and, notwithstanding his past services,\r\nbravery, and endurance, his name was omitted from the list of marshals\r\nof the Empire who were then created.\r\n\r\nHe retired to the country, inspired by a mortification which he could\r\nnot repress; and remained in seclusion, unnoticed, during the early\r\npart of the new war against Spain and Austria, and until 1809 would\r\nseem to have been forgotten; but he had perhaps the consolation of\r\nremembering \"that he must not fear who thirsts for glory; and although\r\nwe often find that true merit is eclipsed for a time, we have never\r\nknown it to be entirely lost; it bursts at last through the clouds\r\nwhich environ it, and appears resplendent in its bright and genuine\r\ncolours.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the words of Fabius Maximus to Emilius when, with Varro, he\r\nwent to lead the Roman army; and thus the \"true merit,\" the coolness\r\nand intrepidity of Macdonald, were destined to shine again, for he was\r\nremembered by Napoleon when that monarch became entangled with the\r\nItalian and Peninsula wars--when the great armies of Austria pressed\r\nhim on one hand and the distant hordes of Russia were gathering on\r\nthe other; then, but not till then, did he seem to remember the brave\r\nsoldier whom petty quarrels and court intrigues had compelled him to\r\noverlook. This was in that year when the perfidy of Napoleon to the\r\nroyal family of Spain and to the whole Spanish nation excited such\r\nindignation, not only at the Court of Vienna, but throughout the whole\r\nof Germany and Europe generally.\r\n\r\nMacdonald was now offered the command of a division in that corps\r\nof the army of Italy led by Prince Eugene Beauharnois, who was then\r\nevincing his usual intrepidity, but was experiencing severe checks\r\nfrom the Archduke John of Austria. This offer he at once accepted, for\r\nhe had grown weary alike of peace and of retirement. He joined Prince\r\nEugene; and from that period was deemed his mentor rather than his\r\nsecond in command.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the right wing he crossed the Isola on the 14th and 15th\r\nof April, 1809, and drove the Austrians from their strong positions at\r\nGoritz, capturing eleven of their guns and much munition of war.\r\n\r\nThese successes led to those at Raab and at Laybach, both of which were\r\nthe result of Macdonald's combinations and manoeuvres; and pushing on\r\nvigorously, without leisure or delay, with his division, he joined the\r\ngrand army of the Emperor before the gates of Vienna.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th and 6th of July he was at the famous battle of Wagram, where\r\nhe led two divisions of infantry, some of which were battalions of the\r\nGarde Impériale. With these he advanced under a fire, when two hundred\r\npieces of cannon were engaged on both sides, and when the roar of\r\nthe conflict was the greatest ever heard even by the oldest veteran\r\nof these warlike armies. Three-fourths of his column perished under\r\nthe storm of shot by which it was assailed as he advanced to break the\r\nAustrian centre, the task assigned to him by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe fury with which his troops came on was irresistible. He drove back\r\nthe brigades of the archduke with immense loss, and a total rout of the\r\nAustrians ensued, thus terminating a two days' conflict which will ever\r\nbe remembered in the annals of carnage--for few prisoners were taken on\r\neither side, which proved the resolution of both--to conquer or die!\r\n\r\nThirty-six thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three officers and\r\nsoldiers of both armies lay killed or wounded on the field and round\r\nthe walls of Vienna; while, as related in the memoir of Count O'Reilly,\r\ncorpses in every variety of uniform, gashed and bloody, floated in\r\nhundreds down the dark waters of the Danube, or were daily thrown upon\r\nits shores to feed the wolves or to fester and decay. Such was the\r\nfield of Wagram, and it was the culminating point in the fortunes of\r\nStephen Macdonald.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, though little disposed to view him with favour, when the\r\nfield was won, sprang from his horse, and embraced him with ardour,\r\nexclaiming,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, Macdonald, we are together for life and death!\"\r\n\r\nHe complimented him before his staff, extolled him in the bulletin, and\r\non the field of battle made him at last a Marshal of the Empire.\r\n\r\nOf all the French marshals he was the only one who thus received a\r\nbâton in the field, and soon after he was created Duke of Tarentum,\r\nfrom a town of that name in Naples.\r\n\r\n\"Among all the marshals of France,\" says the editor of Bourienne's\r\n_Memoirs_, \"there is not one so pure from every stain on the soldier's\r\ncharacter--so daringly honest with Napoleon in his prosperity--so\r\nlastingly true to him in his adversity, as this, his only Scottish\r\nofficer.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon thus bore honourable testimony to the value of his service at\r\nWagram, the glory of which another marshal sought to appropriate to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"As his majesty commands his army in person,\" says Napoleon, in a\r\nprivate order, dated Camp of Schoenbrunn, 9th of July, 1809, \"to him\r\nbelongs the exclusive right of assigning the degree of glory which each\r\nmerits. His majesty owes the success of his arms to the French troops,\r\nand not to strangers. Prince Ponte Corvo's order of the day, tending\r\nto give false pretensions to troops, at best not above mediocrity, is\r\ncontrary to truth, to discipline, and to national honour. The corps\r\nof the Prince of Ponte Corvo did not remain immovable as iron. It was\r\nthe first to retreat. His majesty was obliged to cover it by the corps\r\nof the Guard and the division commanded by Marshal Macdonald, by the\r\ndivision of heavy cavalry commanded by General Nautsonby, and by a part\r\nof the cavalry of the Guard. _To Marshal Macdonald belongs the praise\r\nwhich the Prince of Ponte Corvo arrogates to himself._ His majesty\r\ndesires that this testimony of his displeasure may serve as an example\r\nto every marshal not to attribute to himself the glory which belongs to\r\nothers.\"[27]\r\n\r\nAfter Wagram he commanded in the duchy of Gratz, and maintained in his\r\narmy a discipline so severe in repressing plunder and outrage, that on\r\nhis departure at the peace with Austria, before his division began its\r\nhomeward march for France, the States prayed him to accept an offering\r\nof two hundred thousand francs, but he resolutely declined them.\r\n\r\n\"Messieurs,\" said he, \"I am a soldier--I have done but my duty.\"\r\n\r\nThen the deputies offered him a jewel-box of great value, as a bridal\r\ngift for one of his daughters; and to the bearers he made the following\r\nreply:--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, if you believe that you owe me anything, you shall have the\r\nmeans of repaying me amply, by the care you will take of three hundred\r\npoor invalid soldiers, whom I shall leave in your city.\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon was now in the zenith of his power; his marriage with Maria\r\nLouisa--an espousal more politic than honourable--had been celebrated\r\nat the close of the year of Wagram; and in the year following, Holland,\r\nthe Valais, and the Hanse Towns were annexed to France; territories\r\nwhich, with those of Rome, gave to the new empire an augmentation of\r\nnearly 5,000,000 of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe war was now raging in the Peninsula, and there the feeble measures\r\nof Augereau in Catalonia made Napoleon resolve to supersede him.\r\nThe Duke of Tarentum was named his successor, and, as such, he soon\r\nrestored order among the Catalans. In their mountainous province,\r\nmore than in any other part of Spain, military talent and energy were\r\nrequired; as the entire population--a brave, resolute, and hardy\r\nrace--were in arms against the invaders. Augereau's losses in the\r\ndesultory warfare maintained by the Guerillas were so severe that they\r\nmore than counterbalanced his success in the sieges he undertook; and\r\nthese losses were so indicative of mismanagement that they ensured his\r\nrecal to France. He marched for the frontier laden with the plunder\r\nof Barcelona, and of all the officers who formed its escort, General\r\nChabran was the only one--as the Catalan journals remarked--who did not\r\npillage the house in which he had been quartered; but returned to the\r\nPatron de Caza the silver spoons he had used at table.\r\n\r\nAt this time rapine was the order of the day in the French army; a\r\nhammer and a small saw invariably formed a portion of a soldier's\r\naccoutrements, that he might have tools at hand to break open every\r\nlock-fast place, when the work of pillage began.\r\n\r\nIn Catalonia, Macdonald found himself at the head of 17,000 men; in the\r\nadjoining province of Aragon, Suchet led 16,000; and the Spanish corps\r\nof O'Donnel were the only regular troops opposed to them both.\r\n\r\nOn Suchet laying siege to Tortosa, a fortified city on the left bank of\r\nthe Ebro, Macdonald marched with 12,000 men to secure the entrance of a\r\nconvoy of provisions into Barcelona; and this he achieved in triumph,\r\ndefeating a vigorous attempt of the Spaniards to intercept it.\r\n\r\nO'Donnel, general of the Spaniards, now directed his main efforts to\r\nrelieve Tortosa, where the Conde de Alacha Miguel Lili, with 7800\r\nbrave fellows, who had survived or escaped from the battle of Tudela,\r\nmade a stout resistance. O'Donnel left nothing undone to impede the\r\noperations of the besiegers and raise the blockade; till Macdonald, to\r\ndistract his attention and favour the operations of Suchet, marched\r\nupon Tarragona, a seaport near the mouth of the Francoli. It is\r\npicturesquely situated upon a hill, and is surrounded by old Moorish\r\nwalls, having turrets at intervals. As it is a place of importance,\r\nthe Spaniards were anxious to preserve it, and pressed Macdonald so\r\nseverely that he was forced to take up a position in sight of the\r\ntown, in a plain so near the sea that one of his flanks was exposed to\r\na cannonade from a British frigate. Finding this position untenable,\r\nafter a sharp encounter, and reaping no other advantage from his march\r\nthan the plunder of Reus, a wealthy little manufacturing town, he\r\nretreated across the plains of Tarragona, harassed on both flanks by\r\nthe troops of Sarsfield and Ibarrola, who slew 300 of his soldiers,\r\ncaptured 130, and retook most of the pillage found in Reus and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs a central point, from whence he could cover Suchet's operations\r\nagainst Tortosa, and command a space of country capable of supplying\r\nthe troops with food and forage, Macdonald chose a strong position\r\nnear Cervera, in sight of the Mediterranean. Finding him secure here,\r\nO'Donnel, instead of attacking him, turned the attention of his own\r\ntroops against the French elsewhere, and cut off several of their small\r\ngarrisons, until he received a wound which disabled him.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th December, Macdonald received a welcome reinforcement of ten\r\nthousand men; but, notwithstanding, Eroles, Sarsfield, and Campoverde,\r\nat the head of the Spanish regiments of the line and Guerillas of\r\nCatalonia, fought him successfully in almost every instance. Yet his\r\nmovements so completely covered the siege of Tortosa that, after five\r\nmonths' delay, Suchet was able to break ground before it, and the\r\nConde Lili surrendered at discretion; for which sentence of death was\r\npronounced against him by the Spanish authorities; and with great\r\nsolemnity, in the market-place of Tarragona, the head was struck from\r\nhis _effigy_ by the public executioner.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, Macdonald possessed himself of Figueras, a small Catalonian\r\ntown situated in a fertile plain, not far from the frontier of France.\r\nOn an eminence it has a magnificent castle, with bomb-proof towers\r\nand undermined approaches. This important strength had been taken by\r\nthe French three years before; but on the night of the 10th April,\r\n1811, some Catalonians who had been forced into the ranks of a French\r\nregiment, finding themselves, by a lucky coincidence, all on guard\r\ntogether, resolved to have their revenge. They opened a sally-port\r\nto their countrymen, who entering the castle sword in hand, made the\r\ngarrison, to the number of four thousand men, prisoners, without a shot\r\nbeing exchanged. On the 19th of the following August, Macdonald, after\r\nmeeting with a determined resistance from these Catalonians, retook the\r\ncastle of Figueras, by capitulation, and garrisoned it again for Joseph\r\nBonaparte.\r\n\r\nAfter this recapture, Catalonia seemed to be subjugated to the yoke of\r\nFrance; yet, for some reason unknown, Macdonald was withdrawn from the\r\ncommand of the army there, and it was bestowed upon General Decaen. It\r\nis supposed that Napoleon, who disliked that any one should assume the\r\npart of monitor or judge of his soldiers, was piqued at the tenor of an\r\nobscure passage in Macdonald's report, in which he detailed to Marshal\r\nBerthier the recapture of Figueras. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\"_I please myself in rendering justice_ to the army, in the hope that\r\nthe Emperor will view with an eye of favour these brave fellows,\r\nentreating your excellency _to cause it to be remarked_ to his Majesty\r\nthat his army in Catalonia is a stranger to the event which has\r\nre-united it in this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"How happens it,\" said General Sarrazen, \"that Macdonald, who does not\r\nwant for good sense, should have permitted himself to use such awkward\r\nobservations?\"\r\n\r\nIn the disastrous invasion of Russia he had command of the 10th Corps,\r\nof which the Prussians formed a part. The details of that terrible\r\nwinter campaign are too well known to all the world to require\r\nrecapitulation in these memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor led his army to Smolensko, on the great road to Moscow, and\r\ncrossed the Niemann on the 27th of June.\r\n\r\nMacdonald crossed the same river, on the same day, at Tilsit, by a\r\nbridge of boats, and at the head of his French and Prussians (the Corps\r\nd'Yorck) seized Dunabourg, while Kowno, in Lithuania, fell without\r\na struggle, and the great army of the Empire marched through it in\r\nsplendid order, with all its bands playing and colours flying. How\r\ndifferent was the aspect of the few surviving fugitives of that army\r\nwhen they repassed Kowno in December following!\r\n\r\nWith orders to occupy the line of Riga, and if it was captured, to\r\nthreaten St. Petersburg, Macdonald marched towards the capital of\r\nLivonia, which was occupied by a numerous garrison, whose defensive\r\nmeasures were ably seconded by a British naval force. Napoleon\r\nconceived that if the main body of the Russians fell back on St.\r\nPetersburg, he would, when following them, be able to effect a junction\r\nwith the 10th Corps under Macdonald, after which they could push\r\non together; but though the latter burned the suburbs of Riga, his\r\noperations against the place were long retarded by the bravery of the\r\nbesieged. Though not regularly fortified, the town has considerable\r\nmeans of defence, being encircled by an earthen rampart, and having a\r\ncitadel, while a fortress guards the entrance of the Duna or Dwina.\r\n\r\nThe project of Napoleon became a failure, when the route pursued by\r\nthe retreating Russians proved different from the one he anticipated.\r\nThus he was obliged to advance after them to Moscow, while Macdonald\r\nremained for a time before Riga, on which he could make no impression,\r\nthough he fought under its walls a series of bloody conflicts, in\r\nfutile assaults and repulsing desperate sorties. Suspicion of the faith\r\nof his Prussian regiments was not his least source of anxiety. When\r\nSt. Cyr was alarmed that his flanks might be turned by the Russians\r\nfrom Finland, he wrote an urgent letter to Macdonald requesting him\r\nto oppose the march of those troops who were led by Wittgenstien and\r\nSteinheil, and whose line of march lay in front of the position before\r\nRiga; adding that if he (Macdonald) objected to detach any part of\r\nhis forces from the blockade, to come and assume command of St. Cyr's\r\ndivision in person, and meet this army from Finland. \"But Macdonald,\"\r\nadds Count Segur, \"did not conceive himself justified in making so\r\nimportant a movement without express orders. He distrusted Yorck, the\r\nPrussian general, whom he suspected of intending to deliver up to the\r\nRussians his park of siege artillery. He replied, that to defend it\r\nwas his first and most indispensable duty, and he declined to quit his\r\nstation.\"\r\n\r\nMacdonald's suspicions soon proved correct; for on the 13th December,\r\n1812, when in presence of the enemy, he was abandoned by the whole of\r\nthe Prussians under General Yorck; and was thus compelled to retire,\r\nthough resisting with indomitable energy the attack of the Russians,\r\nwho followed him closely, when sword in hand he sought to hew a passage\r\nto the rear. By this time all was lost elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHe survived the perils of that frightful campaign, in which out of\r\n300,000 soldiers, who, in June, passed the Niemann in all the pomp\r\nof war and pride of former victories, scarcely 50,000 escaped out of\r\nRussia; and of these the greater number had suffered so dreadfully from\r\nwounds, hunger and frost, as to be quite unfit for future service.\r\n\r\nWith 1131 pieces of cannon, there were taken by the Russians 41\r\ngenerals, 1298 officers. 167,410 sergeants and rank and file. The\r\n_rest_ were accounted for by the frost and snow, the Cossack lances,\r\nthe bullet and the sabre, rendering the paths across the whitened\r\nwastes of Russia impassable with the bodies of the dying and the dead.\r\nNever in all the annals of war were greater sufferings detailed than\r\nthose endured by the miserable French on their retreat from flaming\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, Macdonald commanded a corps in Saxony, where, on the 29th\r\nApril, he had the satisfaction of routing at Mercebourg the division of\r\nGeneral Yorck, composed of the _same_ Prussians who had abandoned him\r\nat Riga during the previous year; and at Lutzen, where, on the 2nd May,\r\nthe combined forces of Russia and Prussia met the French in battle, led\r\nby the Emperor in person, he attacked the Prussian reserve, and after a\r\nlong and severe engagement cut it to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I have fully avenged the desertion of General Yorck.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this Napoleon retired and established his head-quarters at\r\nDresden, while Leipzig and Breslau were also occupied by his troops.\r\nOn being reinforced by the Saxons, whose king he held as a species\r\nof hostage for his people, he resolved on attacking the northern\r\nallies near Bautzen; and Macdonald hastened with his division across\r\nthe Spree, to share in the battle which ensued in June. The French\r\ntriumphed, and their foes had to retreat, but in fine order, into\r\nSilesia. Macdonald was despatched by the Emperor in pursuit; but was\r\ncompelled to fall back, as the roads by which he must have marched were\r\nalmost inundated.\r\n\r\nNowhere did he attain more distinction than during the horrors of the\r\nthree days of Leipzig.\r\n\r\nThis Saxon city, which is situated in a fertile plain, has suffered\r\nin many wars, but by none so much as the campaign of 1813. In that\r\nyear Napoleon made it the general hospital for the sick and wounded\r\nof his army; thus its beautiful environs soon became the sad scene of\r\nmany important events. In several battles and skirmishes the allies\r\nhad defeated the French during the months of August and September; but\r\nNapoleon, who, with his characteristic obstinacy, adhered to Dresden as\r\nthe centre of his position, found himself out-manoeuvred, when eighty\r\nmiles _in his rear_ he heard of Marshal Blucher passing the Black\r\nElster, and that Bernadotte, a prince of his own making, but now in\r\narms against him, had arrived, after a long and circuitous march, near\r\nthe suburbs of Leipzig, while Schwartzenbourg drew near that city from\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\nThis was in the month of October.\r\n\r\nThe French numbered 160,000 bayonets and sabres; the allies 240,000.\r\nThe outposts were soon engaged on the 16th; the following day was spent\r\nin skirmishes and manoeuvres till the three allied armies formed a\r\njunction, and the stern conflict of the 18th began with all its terrors\r\nover an extent of line that covered seven miles. A little village on\r\nthe French right, where Napoleon had posted himself, was lost and\r\nretaken again and again at the bayonet's point under a storm of round\r\nand grape shot. Noon arrived, but the battle was still undecided,\r\nwhen all breathless with speed, an officer, with his uniform torn and\r\nbloody, rushed towards the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" he exclaimed, \"the left wing has given way; the Saxon cavalry\r\nand artillery have gone over to the enemy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" replied Napoleon, sternly; \"silence!\"\r\n\r\nThe intelligence was kept secret from the right and centre, and still\r\nthe strife went on.\r\n\r\nBy three p.m. came the still more alarming tidings that the Saxon\r\ninfantry had deserted _en masse_ to the allies. This also was kept a\r\nsecret from the French troops, though the Imperial Guard was ordered\r\nto take their place; but the power thus attained by the allies was no\r\nlonger to be withstood, and a precipitate retreat towards the Rhine\r\nbecame the first thought of the vanquished Emperor.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall he gave the order to fall back, leaving the environs\r\nof Leipzig strewed with dead and dying; but his order was tardily\r\nexecuted, as all the French fugitives with their baggage, cannon,\r\nand wounded, on horseback, on foot, or in waggons, were compelled to\r\ntake _one_ road, every other being occupied by the cavalry and horse\r\nartillery of the victors; consequently, the sufferings and slaughter of\r\nthe French, even after the field was lost, became dreadful. Napoleon,\r\nbefore retiring, had ordered that the bridge of the White Elster should\r\nbe undermined, and directed Macdonald and Prince Joseph Poniatowski,\r\nwith their divisions, to defend a portion of the suburbs that lay\r\nbetween the advancing enemy and the Borna road; and to leave nothing\r\nundone to maintain their post to the last, that the retreat of the\r\narmy and baggage might be fully covered.\r\n\r\nPoniatowski was brave as a lion. He was nephew of Stanislaus Augustus,\r\nthe last King of Poland, and was animated alike by the purest\r\npatriotism and hatred of the Russians; hence he served France against\r\nthem as the oppressors of his house and native country. He had 2000\r\nPolish infantry and a few horse with him; and seeing the desperation\r\nof affairs, as the waggons of wounded, dripping with blood, the heavy\r\nartillery with their tumbrils, and the masses of fugitive soldiery\r\nexhausted by three days of fighting and excitement, pressed in close\r\nranks across the bridge of the Elster, he drew his sabre and turning to\r\nhis countrymen--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"here we must win or lose our honour!--Forward!\"\r\nand at the head of a few Polish cuirassiers he made a rush towards the\r\nenemy. At that moment the bridge of the Elster was _blown up_, and his\r\nretreat cut off for ever!\r\n\r\nMacdonald was similarly circumstanced, as his troops had manned and\r\nenfiladed the suburbs, where they were firing briskly to keep the foe\r\nin check from walls, houses, and hedgerows.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Moniteur_, it was the intention of Napoleon to have\r\nthe bridge blown up only at the last moment, and when all his troops\r\nhad passed the stream. General Dussaussoy had remitted this duty to\r\nColonel Montfort, who, in turn, had remitted it to a corporal and four\r\nsappers. On the first appearance of the enemy upon the road, and when\r\nthe cuirassiers of Poniatowski charged, the startled corporal fired the\r\ntrain, and a dark cloud of dust and stones ascending into the air with\r\na mighty roar, announced the destruction of the bridge; while Macdonald\r\nand his whole corps, with eighty pieces of cannon, all their eagles,\r\nand several hundred carriages laden with powder, baggage, and wounded\r\nmen, were on the _wrong_ side of the river. A shout of astonishment and\r\ndismay arose from those who had crossed; and many an anxious eye was\r\nturned back to Leipzig, where the roar of musketry was yet heard in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThe attention of Napoleon, who had left the city by the road which led\r\nby the bridge to Lindenau (the direct route for France) was arrested by\r\nthe explosion, and one of his aides-de-camp exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Sire--sire--they have blown up the bridge of the Elster, and\r\nMacdonald's corps is _yet in Leipzig_!\"\r\n\r\n\"At that time,\" to quote Bourienne, \"Napoleon was accused of having\r\ngiven orders for the destruction of the bridge, immediately _after_\r\nhis own passage, to secure his retreat from the active pursuit of the\r\nenemy. The English journals were unanimous on this point, and there\r\nwere few of the inhabitants of Leipzig who doubted the fact.\"\r\n\r\nIf this be true, it was a baseness only equalled by the strangulation\r\nof Pichegreu, the torture of Captain Wright in the Temple, and the\r\nlonely butchery of the hapless Duc d'Enghien.\r\n\r\nFinding all lost, and that his retreat was cut off, Macdonald sheathed\r\nhis sword, and calling on his soldiers to escape as they best could,\r\nthrew himself into the river, the waters of which were darkening as the\r\nnight drew on. He swam across, and reached the other side in safety.\r\nPoor Poniatowski, though bleeding and severely wounded, imitated his\r\nexample; but he was pierced by a bullet, from one of the enemy's\r\nskirmishers, who had now lined the steep bank of the Elster, and opened\r\na murderous fire upon the mass of unfortunate fugitives, the wreck of\r\nMacdonald's corps, who were struggling in the stream. In the dark, the\r\nunfortunate prince was swept away with his charger and drowned. Five\r\ndays after, his corpse was found by a fisherman, and interred on the\r\nbank of the stream. A granite sarcophagus, surrounded by acacias and\r\nweeping-willows, marks the place where he lies.\r\n\r\nColonel Montfort, the corporal, and the four sappers, were delivered\r\nover to a court-martial.\r\n\r\nSuch was the closing episode of that terrible day at Leipzig, the\r\nanniversary of the more glorious events of Ulm and of Jena--a day that\r\ncost France nearly forty thousand men.\r\n\r\nNapoleon continued his retreat to Mayence, with an army exhausted by\r\ntoil, crushed by defeat, and savage in spirit, but lacking the stamina\r\nto make one more vigorous stand for France, save at Hanau; for French\r\nsoldiers, more than any other, are the worst to retrieve a disaster.\r\n\r\n\"The _defensive_ system,\" to quote the _Memoirs_ of Marshal Ney,\r\n\"accords ill with the disposition of the French soldier, at least if\r\nit is not to be maintained by successive diversions and excursions;\r\nin a word, if you are not constantly occupied in that little warfare,\r\ninactivity destroys the force of troops who rest continually on the\r\ndefensive. They are obliged to be constantly on the alert night and\r\nday; while, on the other hand, offensive expeditions wisely combined\r\nraise the spirit of the soldier, and prevent him from having time\r\nto ponder on the real cause of his dangerous situation. It is in\r\nthe _offensive_ that you find the French soldier inexhaustible in\r\nresources. His active disposition and valour in assaults double his\r\npower. A general should never hesitate to march with the bayonet\r\nagainst an enemy, if the ground is favourable for the use of that\r\nweapon. It is in the _attack_, in fine, that you accustom the French\r\nsoldier to every species of warfare--alike to brave the enemy's fire,\r\nand to leave the field open to the development of his intelligence and\r\ncourage.\"\r\n\r\nBut now the spirit of the French soldiers was almost dead for a time;\r\nand so ill was this retreat conducted, that the rear-guard, with 20,000\r\nsick and wounded, fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nMacdonald was at the battle of Hanau, the last stand made by this\r\ndiscomfited host in Hesse Cassel. There the French were attacked by\r\nthe Austrians and Bavarians, whom they routed, and then continued\r\nretreating, the whole of their cavalry hewing a passage, sword in hand,\r\nthrough the lines of the enemy.\r\n\r\nHe was now despatched by the Emperor to Cologne, with orders to\r\norganize a new army. These instructions he found the impossibility of\r\nfulfilling, so he abandoned the Rhine, along the banks of which the\r\nbayonets of the allies were glittering everywhere, and falling back\r\ninto the interior of ancient France, with the war-worn veterans of his\r\nshattered column, he formed the left wing of the retreating army; and\r\nat its head, during the campaign of 1814, he gave more than one severe\r\nrepulse to the Prussians, who were pressing towards Paris under Marshal\r\nBlucher. These encounters were chiefly on the banks of the Marne, and\r\nespecially at Nangis, in the north of France, where he fought a severe\r\naction with the allies on the 17th of February; but these struggles and\r\nall the valour of the French Imperialists were vain, for ere long the\r\ncapital was taken; then Germany found itself freed from oppression;\r\nHolland rang with acclamations on the downfall of Napoleon; and\r\nWellington had halted in his long career of victory, on the banks of\r\nthe Garonne, and by the hill of Toulouse.\r\n\r\nMacdonald adhered to the fallen Emperor--the child of Destiny--and\r\nwas with him in the old palace of Fontainebleau at the time of his\r\nabdication from the most splendid of European thrones. Hope had fled.\r\nHis army was dispersed and crumbling to pieces; its great officers\r\nand leaders had abandoned him; and such is the instability of human\r\naffairs, that the people of whose blood he had been so lavish--the\r\npeople to whom he had been a demi-god--were turning with ardour\r\nto another monarch, and welcomed the foemen against whom they had\r\nstruggled for more than twenty years of war and carnage that were\r\nwithout parallel.\r\n\r\n\"The wreck of the army assembled at Fontainebleau,\" says General\r\nBourienne, \"the remains of a million of men levied in fifteen\r\nmonths--comprising the corps of Marshals Oudinot, Ney, Macdonald, and\r\nGeneral Gerard--did not exceed twenty-five thousand.\"\r\n\r\nVarious interviews that took place between Napoleon and the Duke of\r\nTarentum about this time are carefully detailed by this gossiping old\r\nsoldier, in the supplement to the _Biographie Universelle_, and other\r\nmemoirs.\r\n\r\nMacdonald with his corps had marched in with all speed from Montereau,\r\non receipt of an order from the Emperor, that he meant to march on\r\nParis--a resolution that filled his officers with consternation. On the\r\nmarshal's arrival at the palace, the generals waited on him in a body,\r\nto request that he would place before the Emperor, the rashness and\r\ndesperation of attempting to recapture Paris from the allies.\r\n\r\n\"Messieurs,\" said he, \"in the present juncture, such advice might\r\ndisplease his Majesty--leave the matter to me.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he presented himself before Napoleon--\r\n\r\n\"Well, marshal,\" said he, \"how do things go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very ill, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Very ill? How is your division disposed?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is completely discouraged, sire; recent events at Paris have spread\r\nconsternation through its ranks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think you,\" asked the Emperor, \"it will join with me in a movement\r\nupon Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust not to that, sire,\" was the desponding answer; \"should I give\r\nsuch an order, I should hazard being disobeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are we to do?\" said the Emperor, passionately. \"I cannot\r\nremain as I am! I shall march against Paris; I will punish these\r\ninconstant Parisians, and the folly of the senate! Woe to the\r\ngovernment they have plastered up waiting the return of their Bourbons.\r\nTo-morrow I shall place myself at the head of my Old Guard, and\r\nto-morrow we shall be in the Tuileries!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" urged Macdonald, \"are you ignorant that a provisional\r\ngovernment has been established?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sire, read this--a letter from Marshal Bournonville, announcing\r\nthe sentence of forfeiture pronounced by the senate, and the resolution\r\nof the allied generals not to treat with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe countenance of Napoleon became violently contracted. After a pause,\r\nhe exclaimed, furiously,\r\n\r\n\"I shall march upon Paris!\"\r\n\r\n\"March upon Paris, sire,\" reiterated Macdonald; \"that design must be\r\nrenounced, for not a sword will leave its scabbard to follow you.\"\r\n\r\nFinding all indeed over, the bitter subject of his abdication came to\r\nbe gravely considered, and he handed to the marshal a document, on the\r\n4th April, stating that he was ready to quit the throne of France.\r\n\r\nThe tender and honourable part acted by Macdonald at this humiliating\r\nbut memorable time was duly appreciated by the Emperor, who has done\r\nhim ample justice. With Marshal Ney and the Duke of Vicenza, he\r\nwas named one of the commissioners sent by Napoleon to the Emperor\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Duke of Tarentum,\" said the former, before the marshal left\r\nFontainebleau, \"do you think a regency is the only thing possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" continued Napoleon, who had now recovered his composure; \"I\r\ncharge you with my message to the Emperor Alexander; you will go with\r\nNey instead of Marmont. _I rely on you_, and I hope you have entirely\r\nforgotten the circumstances which separated us so long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sire, I have never once thought of them since 1809.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rejoice to hear it,\" replied Napoleon with emotion; \"but marshal--I\r\nmust now make the acknowledgment--_I was wrong_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire!\" exclaimed Macdonald; the Emperor pressed his hand and faltered\r\nout but one word,\r\n\r\n\"Go.\"[28]\r\n\r\nMacdonald vehemently urged that a regency should be established in\r\nFrance, in the person of Maria Louisa, in favour of her son, the young\r\nKing of Rome, and violent altercations took place at the conference.\r\n\r\n\"Speak not to me, sir,\" said he to Bournonville, who opposed him; \"your\r\nconduct has made me forget the friendship of thirty years!\" \"As for\r\n_you_, sir,\" he added, turning to Dupont, \"your behaviour towards the\r\nEmperor is not generous. I acknowledge that he may have been unjust to\r\nyou in the affair of Baylen; but how long has it been the fashion to\r\navenge a personal wrong at the expense of the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed the Duke of Vicenza, \"do not forget that you are\r\nin the presence of the Emperor of Russia.\"\r\n\r\nThe energy with which Macdonald urged the cause of Napoleon\r\nembarrassed the Emperor of Russia; but neither the eloquence with which\r\nhe spoke of the military glory of France, and the resolution of himself\r\nand his comrades never to abandon the family of one who had led them so\r\noften to victory, and with whom they had shared so many perils in war,\r\nnor the arguments with which he sought to enforce the regency, were\r\nsuccessful; and at midnight on the 6th, he returned in dejection to\r\nFontainebleau, to render, with Ney and Caulaincourt, an account of his\r\nmission. Napoleon again exhibited much emotion, and said, with a sigh,\r\n\r\n\"I know, marshal, all you have done for me--with what warmth you have\r\npleaded the cause of my son. They desire my simple and unconditional\r\nabdication? Well--act on my behalf. Go, and again defend my interests\r\nand those of my family.\"\r\n\r\nBourienne and others thus relate their last interview.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said Napoleon, \"I am no longer rich enough to recompense your\r\nlast service, Macdonald; but I can perceive how unwisely I was formerly\r\nprejudiced against you. I can also see the designs of those who\r\ninspired me with that prejudice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied the marshal, \"I have already had the honour to assure\r\nyou, that since 1809 I have been yours in life and death!\"\r\n\r\n\"Since I can no longer recompense you as I would wish, I pray you\r\nto remember that I shall NEVER forget the faithful service you have\r\nrendered me!\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon then turned to Caulaincourt, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Duke of Vicenza, bring my sabre.\"\r\n\r\nCaulaincourt brought the weapon, which was one of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, and placed it in the hands of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\"Behold,\" said he, \"a recompence, Macdonald, which, I believe, will\r\ngive you pleasure. This sabre, which was given to me by Murad Bey, in\r\nEgypt, after we had won the battle of Mount Tabor, accept, my friend--a\r\ngift which, I believe, will gratify you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" replied the marshal, whose voice trembled as he received the\r\nsabre from the Emperor; \"if ever I have a son, this weapon shall be\r\nhis noblest heritage; and as such I will guard it with my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hand, and embrace me!\" exclaimed Napoleon; and throwing\r\nthemselves into each others arms, they parted in tears--parted never to\r\nmeet again as friends.[29]\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the commands of the fallen Emperor, the marshal, on the\r\nday succeeding this impressive farewell, sent in his adhesion to the\r\nnew government.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" he wrote, \"that I am freed from my allegiance to the Emperor\r\nNapoleon, I have the honour to announce to you--the provisional\r\ngovernment--that I accord with the national wish which recalls the\r\ndynasty of Bourbon to the throne of France.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th May, he was named member of the Council of War, and\r\nChevalier of St. Louis. This was an order instituted by Louis XIV. in\r\n1693, and, until the revolution, it remained entirely in possession of\r\nthe French army. The badge was a gold cross of eight points, hung from\r\na broad crimson ribbon. On the 6th June, he was created a peer of the\r\nrealm by the surviving descendant of the Capet family, Louis XVIII.,\r\nwho seemed now firmly seated on the throne of France. But this monarch,\r\nas soon as order was duly established, was sufficiently rash and unwise\r\nto raise doubts about the validity of that law by which, during the\r\nstormy days of the republic, the property of the emigrant noblesse had\r\nbeen confiscated and sold. This was an unpleasant topic to broach at\r\na time when Napoleon, like a caged lion, in Elba was watching for the\r\nmoment to break forth; and Macdonald foresaw that misfortunes might\r\nensue from its discussion; thus, on the 3rd December, 1814, he made\r\nan oration which succeeded in tranquillizing the fears of those who\r\nhad made fortunes amid the anarchy of the republic, or with the growth\r\nof the late military empire. He had, moreover, the amiable intention\r\nof succouring the aged nobles and chevaliers of St. Louis, who were\r\nreturning home after twenty-two years of exile, and the families of\r\nthose whose fidelity to the ancient monarchy had involved them in\r\npenury, expatriation, and ruin.\r\n\r\nHis proposition was to raise twelve millions of annual rents, to be\r\ndivided in proportions according to the rank and necessities of the\r\nclaimants. His motion was received by all honourable men with favour,\r\nand with lively gratitude by those whose cause he had undertaken. He\r\nalso advocated the hard case of his old comrades, the veteran soldiers\r\nof the Empire, who had lost their pay and pensions by the success of\r\nthe restoration.\r\n\r\nMacdonald won the hearts of all by these proposed measures; but they\r\nwere brought forward too late in the year to have any practical or\r\nbeneficial result; for now the eyes of all men were turned towards the\r\nlittle isle of Elba, from whence the _Violet_, as his soldiers named\r\nNapoleon, was confidently expected to come with the spring.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, learning that Madame Moreau, the widow of his old\r\nfriend and brother soldier, had secretly applied in his favour to\r\nan influential friend at Naples, to the effect that the revenues of\r\nthe dukedom of Tarentum, which had been long withheld, should be\r\ncontinued to him, he wrote to the French plenipotentiary at the court\r\nof Ferdinand, praying that, with all gratitude to Madame Moreau, there\r\nmight be no interference in the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Ferdinand of Naples,\" said he, with noble spirit, \"owes me nothing,\r\nfor having routed his armies, revolutionized his kingdom, and forced\r\nhim to seek refuge in Sicily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I not laid it down as a principle,\" replied Ferdinand, \"not to\r\nmaintain one of the French endowments, I would assuredly have made an\r\nexception in favour of Marshal Macdonald.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of March, 1815, the Emperor landed from Elba, and again\r\nEurope vibrated with war. The followers of the Bourbons were struck\r\nwith consternation, and the soldiers to whom Louis XVIII. looked for\r\nprotection and defence, were naturally enough flocking to the standard\r\nof their old leader; and he could turn to none, in his desertion and\r\ndismay, save a few officers of high rank, whose spirit of honour made\r\nthem adhere to their oath of allegiance. The first to whom he addressed\r\nhimself was Marshal Macdonald. He sent that officer to Lyons, where he\r\narrived on the 8th of March, and found the Comte d'Artois in despair at\r\nthe sullen and mutinous spirit exhibited by the troops he commanded.\r\n\r\nMacdonald, of course, could not be surprised at this conduct in the\r\nsoldiers, while his own heart led him towards the Emperor, and an\r\n_oath_ tied him to the throne of the Bourbons; but he ordered a general\r\nparade of all the troops, and reviewed them before the prince. Still\r\nthe same sullenness and the same silence, so unusual in French soldiers\r\nduring a time of excitement, were apparent in the officers and men.\r\nSo strong did this feeling become, that the Comte d'Artois (according\r\nto the _Voice from St. Helena_) had to withdraw in haste from Lyons,\r\naccompanied by _one_ solitary dragoon, while Macdonald marched with a\r\nregiment of cavalry and two battalions of infantry of the line towards\r\nthe bridge of the Rhone, which Napoleon was approaching at the head of\r\na few soldiers of the Old Guard and a force increasing every hour by\r\nthe regiments which deserted as they were despatched against him.\r\n\r\nThe marshal seized and barricaded the bridge, his soldiers still\r\nobeying in silence, till the brass drums of the Emperor were heard\r\nringing on the highway; again the old tri-colour was seen, and the\r\neagles that had spread their gilded wings over so many fatal fields\r\nwere glittering in the sun. The marshal ordered his troops to fix\r\nbayonets and load with ball-cartridge.\r\n\r\nWhere was then the memory of that farewell at Fontainebleau? and where\r\nthe sword of Murad Bey--the souvenir of Mount Tabor? The marshal was\r\ndeeply moved at that moment, but he remembered the oath he had sworn to\r\nLouis XVIII.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Hussars, who formed the imperial advanced guard, dashed boldly\r\nup to the bridge at full speed, and, brandishing their sabres, shouted\r\ntheir old battle-cry, \"_Vive l'Empereur!_\"\r\n\r\nThe effect was electric. The soldiers of Macdonald could no longer\r\nrestrain their long-smothered enthusiasm. They, at least, had sworn no\r\nfealty to King Louis. With a shout they responded, and, waving their\r\ncaps and muskets in welcome, tore aside the barricade, and rushed to\r\nmeet the Emperor, leaving the marshal on horseback, and by the roadside\r\n_alone_.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Hussars wished to seize and deliver him to the Emperor, but,\r\nanimated by a high sense of chivalry, his own dragoons, who had come\r\nwith him from Lyons, would by no means permit this, and drew their\r\nranks across the road until he escaped. He returned immediately to\r\nParis, and was desired by Louis XVIII. to command in the army formed\r\nunder the Duc de Berri. This army proved, however, but a phantom, as\r\nthe soldiers composing it almost to a man joined the banner of the\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nLeft thus alone, Macdonald repaired to the unfortunate king, and on the\r\nnight of the 20th of March accompanied him on his retreat to Menin;\r\nbut he again returned to Paris, where pleading his oath of fidelity,\r\nsworn by the Emperor's desire to the Bourbons, he declined to serve\r\nthe imperial cause or become one of the Chamber of Peers under it--a\r\nrefusal, doubtless, most painful to one who knew that he owed all his\r\nrank and honours to Napoleon. Relinquishing all these, as it were, for\r\na time, the marshal duke enrolled himself as a simple grenadier in\r\nthe National Guard of Paris, and as such did military duty during the\r\nusurpation, as it was named; and in the plain uniform of this corps,\r\ndivested of medals, crosses, and epaulettes, he appeared as a private\r\nsentinel before Louis XVIII. on his return to the Tuileries.\r\n\r\nOn the capitulation of Paris to the allies the remains of Napoleon's\r\narmy, then encamped beyond the Loire, were placed under the command\r\nof Macdonald, whose instructions were to remodel and re-organize the\r\nregiments, a difficult and arduous mission, which he accomplished with\r\nequal fidelity and address; but the soldiers, dispirited by the defeat\r\nat Waterloo, awed into submission by the flight of their idol Napoleon,\r\nand the presence of the overwhelming masses of the allies, obeyed him\r\nin silence and dejection. All was over now with the Bonapartists. The\r\narmy of the Empire was broken and scattered, like the marshal dukes who\r\nhad led it to those glories and conquests of which there remained but\r\nthe memory now!\r\n\r\nIn the words of M. Fleury de Chabulon, \"Marshal Ney was the first to\r\ngive the alarm and despair of the safety of his country. Marshal Soult\r\nhad abjured his command, Marshal Massena, exhausted by victory, had no\r\nlonger the strength required by circumstances; Marshal Macdonald, deaf\r\nto the war-cry of his old companions, left his sword peacefully in its\r\nscabbard; Marshal Jourdan was on the Rhine; Marshal Mortier had the\r\ngout at Beaumont; Marshal Suchet evinced repugnance and irresolution;\r\nand finally, the Marshals Davoust and Grouchy no longer enjoyed the\r\nconfidence of the army.\"\r\n\r\nThus the throne that had been so long propped by bayonets and by the\r\nsplendid chivalry of the Old Guard and of the whole imperial army, had\r\ncrumbled into dust at last!\r\n\r\nFor his talent in organizing the army of the Loire Macdonald received\r\nthe office of Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, succeeding the\r\nAbbé de Pradt on the 10th of January, 1816, and on the 3rd of May, in\r\nthat year, he was appointed Knight Commander of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIt is related that, when dining one day at the Tuileries, Charles X.\r\nsaid to him--\r\n\r\n\"How came it to pass, marshal, that when serving in our Irish regiment\r\nof Dillon, which emigrated _with us_ entirely, you still remained in\r\nFrance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" he replied, \"because I was in love with Mademoiselle Jacob; and\r\nI applaud myself for it, since to that girl's love I owe the honour of\r\nbeing this day at table with your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, had I emigrated, I might have lived in penury and died of\r\ndespair; but now, sire, I am a duke and marshal of France.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply was so frank and politic, that the king questioned him no\r\nmore on that subject. He was one of the four marshals who had command\r\nof the Royal Guard; and as one of a commission appointed to inquire\r\ninto the recruiting of the army, on the 24th of February, 1818, he made\r\nan able report upon the oppressive law of conscription, urging upon the\r\nFrench ministry the British system of voluntary enlistment.\r\n\r\nFour years after this, by a royal ordinance, he procured the reversion\r\nof his rank and titles to the Marquis de Rochedragon, his son-in-law;\r\nbut this ordinance was useless, as there was no prospect of that noble\r\nhaving any family. Thus, the marshal being anxious to have a male\r\nheir--all his children being daughters--he married, in his fifty-eighth\r\nyear, Mademoiselle de Bourgoing, and from that period led a quiet and\r\nretired life. Soon after his marriage he came to Scotland, the land of\r\nhis forefathers.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his aide-de-camp, Colonel Count Couessin, a nobleman\r\nwho was descended from an ancient family in Brittany, and was the\r\nhusband of his niece, Macdonald arrived in Edinburgh about the middle\r\nof June, 1825. He remained at an hotel, where he received the cards\r\nof all persons of distinction in the vicinity, and was visited by\r\nevery gentleman in the city who bore his name. He attended mass in the\r\nCatholic church of St. Mary, and viewed all the great \"sights\" of the\r\nScottish metropolis. A Mr. Macdonald Buchanan invited him to a dinner\r\nat which Sir Walter Scott, Lord Jeffrey, and Henry Cockburn, were\r\npresent, with several gentlemen who claimed the marshal as a clansman\r\nand relation. \"From what I see of you, gentlemen,\" said he, when\r\nreturning thanks after his health had been proposed, \"and from what I\r\nhave remarked of this country, I feel more pride than ever in having\r\nScottish blood in my veins.\"\r\n\r\nWith great interest he visited the battle-field of Prestonpans, and\r\nviewed the ground from the Thorntree, where Colonel Gardiner was slain\r\nby the Highlanders. After being _fêted_ at Hopeton House, he left\r\nEdinburgh for the Highlands, with the intention of visiting every part\r\nof the country in which his father had accompanied Prince Charles\r\nEdward, during their flight and concealment after Culloden.\r\n\r\nOn his way north, he visited the field of Bannockburn, on the 24th of\r\nJune, the anniversary of the battle; and, after surveying the ground\r\nwith a soldier's eye, he praised the dispositions and the valour of\r\nRobert Bruce. Everywhere he expressed himself \"enraptured with the\r\nbeauty of the country; and above all, of the metropolis of Scotland.\"\r\nHe visited the \"fair city\" of Perth; and accompanied by Macdonald of\r\nStaffa, reached Inverness early in July, and went immediately to the\r\nfield of Culloden, where his father's sword had been drawn for the\r\nlast of the Stuarts. There he gazed about him long and thoughtfully,\r\nsurveying the desert moor, which is yet dotted by the green graves of\r\nthe loyal and brave men who fell there.\r\n\r\nHe expressed astonishment that the prince, with his slender army of\r\nswordsmen, destitute alike of horse and artillery, should have fought\r\ntwice the number of regular troops on such ground, instead of retiring\r\ninto the mountains, and harassing the army of Cumberland by a guerilla\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nIn the ill-fated _Comet_ (a steamer which was wrecked a short time\r\nafter, under distressing circumstances) he left the Highland capital\r\nfor the wild mountain-shore of Arisaig; and to a large dinner-party on\r\nboard he made an address expressive of his admiration for the Scottish\r\nclans, \"than whom,\" said he, \"no people, I think, deserve to be more\r\nesteemed for their national character and uniform good conduct.\"\r\nEverywhere he was _fêted_ and welcomed with Highland ardour and\r\nhospitality, and in many instances by old Highland soldiers and retired\r\nofficers, who had served against him in Holland, Germany, and Spain.\r\n\r\nOn his landing under the walls of Armidale Castle in Sleat, on the\r\nsouthern shore of Skye, he was saluted by fifteen pieces of cannon, and\r\nwas received by a body of his clansmen in full Highland arms and array,\r\nunder Lord Macdonald.\r\n\r\nAt the beautiful ruins of Castle Tiorm, in \"the country of Clanranald,\"\r\nthere was presented to him an aged clansman, named Alaster Macdonald,\r\nthen in his hundredth year, who had known his father, and remembered\r\nthe melancholy embarkation of Prince Charles and his fugitive\r\nfollowers, seventy-nine years before. With this old namesake the\r\nmarshal conversed long, and asked him many questions about the personal\r\nappearance, &c., of Prince Charles Edward.\r\n\r\nHe left the Scottish isles in a government ship, and reached Dublin\r\non the 16th of July; and there he again met Sir Walter Scott, who had\r\narrived in the same city on the previous day.\r\n\r\n\"Respecting his visit (to Scotland) a singular tradition is preserved\r\nin France,\" says Dr. Memes; \"namely, that, on being introduced to Sir\r\nWalter Scott, the marshal offered to place at the disposal of the\r\nhistorian authentic and unpublished intelligence on certain important\r\nand misrepresented events. Sir Walter declined the proffered aid, with\r\nthe remark, 'Thank you, marshal; but I prefer taking my materials from\r\npopular and current reports.' We relegate this to the class of fables.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his return to France, he led a life of quiet and retirement, and\r\nfor nearly twenty-five years his name was rarely heard. He grew rapidly\r\nfeeble; for his long career of war in almost every country in Europe,\r\nand the numerous severe wounds he had received, brought age quickly\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe died in his seventy-fifth year, on the 24th of September, 1840, at\r\nhis country house near Courcelles. A noble and generous eulogy was\r\npronounced upon him by General Count Philip de Segur, author of a\r\nhistory of Napoleon's Russian expedition, and who in former days had\r\nbeen the aide-de-camp of Macdonald.\r\n\r\nThe latter was pure in spirit and generous in heart, faithful and\r\nbenevolent in peace, as he was brave and true in battle. Sarrazen thus\r\ndescribes him:--\r\n\r\n\"The Duke of Tarentum is of a good size, of a slender make, but robust\r\nand pale-faced, with eyes full of fire; his smile is sardonic, his\r\nbearing military, and his manners polished. I believe him to be a\r\nsincere friend; and although he showed a weakness of character in the\r\ncouncil of war which occasioned the loss of the battle of Trebia,\r\nwe cannot but allow him to have all the firmness necessary to a good\r\ngeneral.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been already shown that the misfortune on the banks of the\r\nTrebia arose from circumstances over which the marshal had no control;\r\nbut it was a battle that he fought long and gallantly.\r\n\r\nHe was thrice married; first to Mademoiselle Jacob, one of the most\r\nbeautiful girls in France, by whom he had two daughters, one of whom\r\nmarried Sylvester Rene, Duke of Massa, in Italy; and the youngest to\r\nAlphonse Comte de Perregaux. He married secondly, Madame Joubert,\r\nformerly Mademoiselle de Montholon, widow of his comrade the brave\r\nGeneral Joubert, who was slain in battle against Suwarrow at Novi, on\r\nthe 16th of August, 1799. By her the marshal had an only daughter,\r\nafterwards the Marchioness de Rochedragon. He married thirdly, Madame\r\nde Bourgoing, daughter of the superintendent of the Royal Hospital at\r\nSt. Denis, and widow of the Ambassador Baron de Bourgoing.[30]\r\n\r\nThey had two children: to the joy of the old marshal one of these was a\r\nson, whom he named Alexander, and who in October, 1824, was held at the\r\nbaptismal font by his Majesty Charles X. and Madame the Dauphinesse,\r\nand who now inherits the dukedom of Tarentum, and the sabre of Mont\r\nTabor.\r\n\r\nSuch was the career of Stephen Macdonald, the son of an obscure\r\nScottish fugitive from the field of Culloden, who thus became a Marshal\r\nDuke of the Empire, and by his worth and bravery shed a glory on his\r\nfather's name and on the rank he won.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: \"General Macdonald, who has come forward with so much\r\n_éclat_ as commander of a French column, is the descendant of a Mr.\r\nMacdonald of Argyleshire. His uncle is Mr. Macdonald of Kinlochmoidart.\r\nHe preserves his clannish affections, and in the campaign of Pichegreu\r\nin Flanders and Holland, having command of a brigade which had to press\r\non a British brigade, where he discovered a _namesake_, he supplied his\r\ncountryman during the memorable retreat with every comfort which a camp\r\ncould afford.\"--_Edinburgh Herald_, 10th January, 1799.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: General Sarrazen says _fifteen_ thousand (?)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Bourienne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: _Bourienne._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: \"The sabre I recognised at once; only since I\r\nhad last seen it, the following words had been engraved on the\r\nblade:--_Sabre worn by the Emperor on the day of the battle of Mount\r\nTabor_.\"--_Bourienne_, vol. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: _Biographie Universelle_, &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS DALYELL,\r\n\r\nOF BINNS, GENERAL OF THE SCOTTISH ARMY, AND FIRST COLONEL OF THE SCOTS\r\nGREY DRAGOONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my novel of _The Scottish Cavalier_ I have endeavoured to portray\r\nthe character of this celebrated cavalier officer, with all that\r\nmilitary sternness and ferocity of disposition which has generally been\r\nattributed to him, but chiefly by his enemies, for the poor man seems\r\nnever to have found a single friend among the many historians of the\r\nCovenant. Thus, notwithstanding his unwavering loyalty to the House\r\nof Stuart in the days of its declension, by his extreme severity when\r\nthat House was in the zenith of its power, he became so unpopular in\r\nScotland, that his memory is still execrated there. He is stigmatized\r\nas a \"persecutor,\" as the _Bloody Dalyell_, whose spirit is yet averred\r\nto haunt the fields where he routed or slew the children of the\r\nCovenant--who had sold himself to the devil; one who was shot-proof, and\r\n\r\n \"Whose form no darkening shadow traced\r\n Upon the sunny wall;\"\r\n\r\none who, when he spat, burned a hole in the earth; one in whose\r\nmilitary boots water would boil, and whose spectre, habited in a buff\r\ncoat and morion, wearing that voluminous white beard for which he was\r\nso remarkable, still haunts the house in which he was born and the tomb\r\nin which he lies.\r\n\r\nDescended from an old baronial family, which was afterwards ennobled\r\nby the Earldom of Carnwath, and which acquired its estates about the\r\nend of the sixteenth century he was the son of Thomas Dalyell, of the\r\nBinns, in West Lothian, and of the Honourable Janet Bruce, a daughter\r\nof the first Lord Bruce of Kinloss, the eminent minister of James\r\nVI.--a peer whose skill in statecraft, in conjunction with the Earl of\r\nMar, was of great service in securing James's peaceful accession to the\r\nEnglish throne in 1603.\r\n\r\nThomas Dalyell, the younger, is said to have been born about the year\r\n1599, during the reign of James VI. in Scotland, at his father's house\r\nof Binns, in the parish of Abercorn, Linlithgowshire. The ancient name\r\nis Dalyell; but the _z_ has since crept in, by the corruption of the\r\nletter _y_ in old Scottish orthography, and hence the pronunciation of\r\nit so puzzling to an English tongue.\r\n\r\nDalyell is first heard of as an officer of those auxiliary Scottish\r\ntroops sent to Ireland by their native Parliament, at the request of\r\nCharles I., to protect the Ulster colonists, and assist in repressing\r\nthe rebellion under Sir Phelim O'Neil and Macguire, when the dreadful\r\nmassacre of the English took place.\r\n\r\nFor this service the Parliament of Scotland levied eight battalions\r\nof infantry, of whom two thousand five hundred were Highlanders. Arms\r\nfor three thousand men were offered to the Irish Protestants, and the\r\ncastles of Craigmore and Carrickfergus, two small strongholds in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, were supplied with all requisite munitions of war\r\nfrom the magazines at Dumbarton.\r\n\r\nThe colonels of the eight Scottish regiments which mustered in\r\nNovember, 1641, were as follow:--\r\n\r\nArchibald, Earl of Argyle, afterwards executed for treason in 1660.\r\n\r\nSir Duncan Campbell, of Auchinbreck, who was afterwards slain at the\r\nbattle of Inverlochy.\r\n\r\nSir Mungo Campbell, of Lawers. These three had Highland battalions.\r\n\r\nAlexander Lord Forbes, who had served the King of Sweden.\r\n\r\nWilliam, Earl of Lothian.\r\n\r\nAlexander, Earl of Eglinton.\r\n\r\nLord Sinclair.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lindesay.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir David Leslie, of Pitcairly, was to command the whole.\r\nArgyle deputed the leading of his regiment to its lieutenant-colonel,\r\nJames Wallace, of Auchans; Lord Sinclair's was led by his major, Sir\r\nJames Turner, the celebrated military memorialist, and that of the Lord\r\nLindesay was led by Major Borthwick.\r\n\r\nThomas Dalyell was an officer in these forces, but to which corps\r\nhe was attached is not clearly known. He was with the first column\r\nof those auxiliaries which, under Major-General Munro--an officer\r\nwho had long served with distinction in Germany, at the head of Lord\r\nReay's Highlanders--embarked on the 2nd of April, 1642, for Ireland.\r\nHe had with him three thousand infantry, six hundred cavalry, and a\r\ntrain of guns. Landing in the north of Ireland, he took possession\r\nof Carrickfergus, and in it placed a garrison under young Dalyell's\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe second column sailed for Ireland on the 27th of July under Sir\r\nDavid Leslie, the same general who afterwards commanded the Scottish\r\narmy at the battle of Dunbar, and for his services was raised to the\r\npeerage as Lord Newark.\r\n\r\nAt Carrickfergus Munro shot thirty Irish prisoners who were accused of\r\ncommitting outrages upon the Protestants. Local tradition has swelled\r\nthis number to _three thousand_, and adds that they were thrown over\r\ncertain rocks named the Gobbins.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th and 29th of April Munro was joined at Carrickfergus by Lord\r\nConway and Colonel Chichester, with eighteen hundred English infantry,\r\nfive troops of horse, and two of dragoons; and in May he succeeded in\r\neffecting a junction with Sir Henry Tichbourne of Beaulieu, when their\r\nunited forces mustered only two thousand horse and twelve thousand\r\ninfantry. At this time the pay of an English colonel was 3_l._ a week;\r\nof a captain, 2_l._; of a private, 3_s._ 6_d._ In 1645 more troops were\r\nrequired in Scotland to oppose the Cavaliers on the one hand, and the\r\nIrish on the other; thus, on the 27th of February, the Scottish shires\r\nand boroughs mustered a great force, whose pay was 6_s._ Scots per day.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that Dalyell was at the battle of Benburb, a\r\nvillage of Tyrone, where, in the spring of 1646, General Munro was\r\ndefeated by the Irish, and forced to retire, with the loss of three\r\nthousand four hundred and twenty-three slain; Lord Montgomerie,\r\ntwenty-one other officers, a hundred and fifty privates, the Scottish\r\nartillery, twenty stand of colours, and fifteen hundred baggage and\r\ncavalry horses taken. \"In vain did Lord Blaney take pike in hand, and\r\nstand in the ranks. Though exposed to the play of Munro's guns and\r\nmusketry, the Irish infantry charged up hill without firing a shot.\r\nThey met a gallant resistance; but Blaney and his men held their ground\r\nlong, till the superior vivacity and freshness of the Irish clansmen\r\nbore him down.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1648 we still find Dalyell, then a colonel, in command at\r\nCarrickfergus, when that little fortress was surprised by General Monk,\r\nwho took possession of it in the name of the English Parliament, and\r\nmade both Munro and Dalyell prisoners of war. The former he sent to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nHenry Guthry, Bishop of Dunkeld, in his Memoirs, asserts that\r\nthe castle was surrendered to Monk treacherously, by the Earl of\r\nGlencairn's regiment, which formed the garrison.\r\n\r\nDalyell was so deeply imbued by the Cavalier loyalty of the period,\r\nthat about this time, on the death of Charles I., to testify his grief,\r\nhe made a vow never to shave his beard until he had avenged him; and\r\nhe cultivated this appendage to his stern visage until it attained\r\ngreat length and volume, for it covered his whole breast and descended\r\nbelow his girdle, as we may still see by the portraits of him. At this\r\nperiod _vow beards_, as they were named, were not unusual with the more\r\nresolute and enthusiastic of the Cavaliers. The comb with which Dalyell\r\nwas wont to dress his hair is still preserved at Binns, \"and it gives\r\na vast idea of the extent of beard and of the majestic character of\r\nDalyell in general, being no less than _twelve_ inches broad, while the\r\nteeth are at least six inches deep.\"\r\n\r\nDalyell was too enterprising and restless a spirit to remain long\r\na prisoner; for he soon achieved his liberty, and, on returning to\r\nScotland, was appointed major-general, and held that rank in the army,\r\nwhich consisted of eleven regiments of horse and twenty battalions of\r\ninfantry, with fourteen field pieces, and which was led by Charles II.\r\ninto England in 1651. At the head of his brigade he fought bravely at\r\nthe fatal field of Worcester, where, on the defeat of the Scots, he had\r\nthe misfortune to be again taken prisoner, and, with other officers\r\nand captives of rank, was marched, under a sure guard, to London, and\r\ncommitted to the Tower.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, in his history of Scotland, mentions (but I know\r\nnot on what authority) that he had previously served in the wars of\r\nMontrose.\r\n\r\nFor his loyalty and service in England his estates were declared, by\r\nthe dominant party in Scotland, to be forfeited, and his name was\r\nspecially excluded from the general Act of Indemnity. But Dalyell was\r\nnot to be withheld even by the guards or gates of the Tower of London,\r\nfor he soon after effected his escape again--_how_ is not recorded;\r\nbut after lurking somewhere on the Continent, he suddenly made his\r\nappearance, in March, 1654, off the northern coast of Scotland, in a\r\nsmall vessel, at a time when the Lowlands were overawed by eighteen of\r\nCromwell's garrisons and by ten thousand regular forces maintained by\r\nhim, by Argyle, and his adherents.\r\n\r\nThis was in anticipation of the Restoration, and at a time when the\r\ncause of royalty in Britain seemed most desperate. Being joined by a\r\nColonel Blackadder and a slender band of loyalists, he took possession\r\nof the castle of Skelko, and, wherever he went, boldly proclaimed\r\nthe king, and denounced Argyle and Cromwell as rebels and regicides.\r\nTo stimulate his exertions, he received the following characteristic\r\nletter from the young king, Charles II.:--\r\n\r\n \"Tom Dalyell,\r\n\r\n \"Though I need say nothing to you by this honest bearer, Captain\r\n Mewes, who can tell you all I would have said, yet I am willing\r\n to give it to you under my own hand, that I am very much pleased\r\n to hear how constant you are in your affection to me, and in your\r\n endeavours to advance my service. We have all a hard work to do; yet\r\n I doubt not God will carry us through it: and you can never fear that\r\n I will forget the good part you have acted, which, trust me, shall\r\n be rewarded, whenever it shall be in the power of your affectionate\r\n friend,\r\n\r\n \"Charles R.\"[31]\r\n\r\n \"Colen, 30th Dec. 1654.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt of Dalyell's had been made in unison with the Earl\r\nof Glencairn's rash but gallant expedition to the Highlands, when\r\nGlengarry, Lochiel, Struan, and other chiefs, whose swords were never\r\nin the scabbard when Scotland or her king required them, met in the\r\nwilds of Lochearn, and made an arrangement to rise in arms and attempt\r\na restoration; but all hope of success soon proved desperate, and they\r\ndispersed. Dalyell abandoned the castle he had taken, and retired once\r\nmore to the Continent, where he obtained from the exiled king a letter\r\nor certificate, in which his bravery, loyalty, and faith, were warmly\r\nextolled and recommended.\r\n\r\nFurnished with this, and having nothing else in the world now but his\r\nsword and his stout heart, the penniless cavalier resolved to seek his\r\nfortune in foreign wars. Proceeding to Russia, which has ever formed\r\nso ample a field for Scottish enterprise and valour, he visited the\r\nbarbarous court of the czar, and applied for military service.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign then reigning was Alexis Michailowitch, grandson of the\r\npatriarch Fedor Romanoff, who in his fifteenth year had succeeded in\r\n1645 to the title of czar; and is chiefly remarkable as being the\r\nfather of Peter the Great, who raised the Muscovites from the depths of\r\nbarbarism to a state of comparative civilization.\r\n\r\nThe letter of Charles II. at once procured for Dalyell the rank of\r\nlieutenant-general in the service of Muscovy; but great obscurity\r\ninvolves his career in that country, for even the wars in which he was\r\nengaged were little noted by the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was now in his fifty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nAlexis invited several other Scots to join his army being anxious to\r\nintroduce a more regular system of discipline into his ranks; but the\r\nmost eminent of these were General Drummond, Governor of Smolensko, and\r\nthe two Gordons,[32] who, under Peter the Great, brought to perfection\r\nthe standing forces of Russia, which however were so few, that in 1687\r\nthey amounted to no more than ten thousand men. An old topographical\r\nwork, published at the Savoy in London, in 1711, mentions that \"the\r\nRussians endeavoured to bring their soldiers under better discipline;\r\nfor which end they made use of a great many Scots and German officers,\r\nwho instruct them in all the warlike exercises that are practised by\r\nother European nations.\"\r\n\r\nAt that time--the beginning of the last century--their infantry were\r\narmed with a musket, sword, and an axe, which were slung behind; their\r\ncavalry were clad in steel morions and cuirasses, and were armed with\r\nbows, arrows, iron mouls, sabres, targets, and spears; and in the epoch\r\nof Dalyell, their army had a great battle-drum, which was fastened to\r\nthe backs of four horses abreast, and had eight drummers to beat upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHis first active service was against the Poles, with whom Alexis\r\nMichailowitch had gone to war in 1653, and from whom he captured\r\nSmolensko, which he united to Russia, and Kiow, after committing\r\nfrightful devastations in Lithuania. The Russian armies then invaded\r\nLivonia, stormed Dorpt, Kokenhausen, and other places, but were obliged\r\nto retire from before Riga with severe loss.\r\n\r\nDalyell was now raised to the rank of full general, and commanded\r\nagainst the Tartars, and the Turkish armies of Mohammed IV.--the son\r\nof the debauched Sultan Ibrahim--against whom Alexis declared war\r\nabout this time (1654-5); and in these contests, waged at the head of\r\nbarbarous hordes against hordes equally barbarous, the wanderer must\r\nhave acquired much of that unyielding sternness, if not ferocity, which\r\ncharacterized his future proceedings in his own country. In these\r\ncampaigns quarter was never asked nor given; prisoners were shot,\r\nbeheaded, impaled, or put to death by slow fires, and by every species\r\nof torture that Muscovite brutality, or the most refined cruelty of\r\nthe Oriental mind could suggest; and in this terrible arena of foreign\r\nservice was schooled the future commander-in-chief of the Scottish\r\ntroops--the scourge of the Covenanters--he to whom was given full power\r\nto crush and to destroy the men who struggled for freedom of religious\r\nopinion, for liberty of conscience, and who, as they phrased it, \"drew\r\nthe sword for an oppressed Kirk and broken Covenant.\"\r\n\r\nAfter eleven years of service in these wild and snow-covered regions,\r\nDalyell requested permission, by desire of Charles II., to return to\r\nScotland. The king had now been restored; Cromwell was in his grave;\r\nthe Parliament and great officers of state had once more taken upon\r\nthem the _mis_government of Scotland, and a wicked war was maintained\r\nthere against the Presbyterian Church, which Lauderdale and his\r\nministry were leaving nothing undone to subvert and to suppress.\r\nThe Laird of Binns now requested from the czar a certificate of his\r\nfaithful service in Russia, and a missive to that effect was passed\r\nunder the great seal of the empire.\r\n\r\n\"Part of this document,\" says Chambers, \"was conceived in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n\"That he formerly came hither to serve our great Czarian Majesty:\r\nwhilst he was with us, he stood against our enemies and fought\r\nvaliantly. The military men that were under his command, he regulated\r\nand disciplined, and himself led them to battle: and he did and\r\nperformed everything faithfully, as a noble commander. And for his\r\ntrusty services we were pleased to order the said lieutenant-general to\r\nbe a general. And now having petitioned us to give him leave to return\r\nto his own country, _We_, the great Sovereign and Czarian Majesty,\r\nwere pleased to order, that the said noble General, Thomas, the son of\r\nThomas Dalyell, should have leave to go to his own country.\r\n\r\n\"And by this patent of our Czarian Majesty, we do testify of him, that\r\nhe is a man of virtue and honour, and of great experience in military\r\naffairs. And in case he should be willing _again_ to serve our Czarian\r\nMajesty, he is to let us know of it beforehand, and he shall come into\r\nthe dominions of our Czarian Majesty, with proper passports. Given at\r\nour Court, in the Metropolitan City of Moscow, in the year from the\r\nCreation of the World 7173, January 6.\"[33]\r\n\r\nFrom Russia he was accompanied by his countryman and old\r\nfellow-soldier, who had served with him in Ireland, General Drummond,\r\nwho was also summoned by Charles II. and obeyed the royal behest.\r\nIn an Act passed by the Scottish Parliament in 1686, granting this\r\nofficer the lands of Torwoodie, it is stated \"that upon a call from his\r\nmajesty's royal brother, after his restoration, he left a splendid and\r\nhonourable employment under the Emperor of Russia to give obedience to\r\nhis native prince, and since his return to this kingdom, he did good\r\nand signal service as major-general, in the defeat of the rebels and\r\nsuppression of the rebellion raised in 1686.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in Burnet it would seem, that when the nonjuring exiles\r\nat Rotterdam and other Covenanters, were preparing to rise in arms in\r\n1665, and when Charles II. found the necessity of raising more troops,\r\nhe formally summoned Dalyell home.\r\n\r\n\"Two gallant officers,\" continues the Bishop, in the \"History of his\r\nown Times,\" \"that had served him in the wars, and when these were over\r\nhad gone with his letters to serve in Muscovy, where one of them,\r\nDalyell, was raised to be a general, and the other was advanced to be\r\na lieutenant-general and Governor of Smolensko, were now, but _not\r\nwithout great difficulty_, sent back by the czar.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Dalyell returned to Scotland, with a\r\nheart boiling with rancour against those who had sold and destroyed the\r\nking; and who had brought so many of his brother soldiers--the Scottish\r\nCavaliers of Montrose, of Hamilton and Munro--and so many of his own\r\nkinsmen, to the scaffold. With this sentiment may have been a longing\r\nfor vengeance upon those who had been so long dominant in the land; who\r\nhad deprived him of his estate and driven him into exile; and all these\r\nbitter sentiments were doubtless fostered by the inborn prejudice of\r\nclass, religion, education, and the foreign service of years. To all\r\nthese must be attributed many of the fierce and relentless acts which\r\nare related of him by the historians of the Covenant. Many of these\r\ndark deeds must, however, be doubted; and many accepted with caution.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration, the Parliament of Scotland, which was presided\r\nover by Lieutenant-General the Earl of Middleton as High Commissioner,\r\nproved a very pliant and complying body. They granted to Charles\r\nII. a revenue of 40,000_l._ for life, and rescinded all the acts\r\npassed by their wiser predecessors for defining or _restricting_ the\r\nroyal prerogative. The Solemn League and Covenant was pronounced a\r\ntreasonable and seditious bond; and they passed other acts, by which\r\nthe Earl of Lauderdale, Secretary of State for Scotland, gradually\r\nprepared a way for the abolition of Presbytery, and the restoration of\r\nan Episcopal Hierarchy. Alarmed by these measures, the Scottish Kirk\r\nsent James Sharpe, one of their most eminent divines, to expostulate\r\nwith Charles II.; but Sharpe abandoned his colours, and betrayed their\r\ncause by accepting the Archbishopric of St. Andrews, while the Marquis\r\nof Argyle, James Guthrie, and Johnstone of Warriston, who had conspired\r\nwith Cromwell, and directly, or indirectly, abetted the sale and\r\nexecution of Charles I., were consigned to the headsman. Such was the\r\nnew aspect of affairs, and it made religion and rancour grow side by\r\nside in the land.\r\n\r\nThe rash king next enjoined the Scottish privy council openly to\r\nestablish Episcopacy, and bishops for the new dioceses were consecrated\r\nin England; while Fairfowl, Archbishop of Glasgow, was insane enough to\r\nsolicit an act of council to eject all recusant ministers, and close\r\ntheir churches until episcopally ordained incumbents could be procured:\r\nand by this act, _three hundred and fifty_ parishes, about a third of\r\nthose in the kingdom, were declared to be vacant; and this tyranny was\r\nattempted after all the wars, battles, and bloodshed in defence of the\r\nCovenant--after all the armies levied and lives lost since 1638, and\r\nafter the king himself had perished in attempting to subvert the rights\r\nof the people! Now, the Scots became justly more than ever inflamed\r\nagainst the cruelty and injustice of their own government.\r\n\r\nFinding their churches closed, they met in arms on the green\r\nhill sides, and in lonely muirs, to hold what were termed field\r\nconventicles, where the oppression they endured for conscience sake,\r\nthe recollection of their present danger, and the memory of their\r\nstruggles made in years gone by, together with the grandeur of the\r\nsolemn scenery by which they were surrounded, filled their hearts with\r\na splendid enthusiasm and with a purity of soul, as, with the sword by\r\ntheir sides, they worshipped God in those wild places, which, since the\r\ndays of the Romans, had been the best stronghold of their forefathers.\r\n\r\nAs a ballad (which I quote from memory) has it:--\r\n\r\n \"Oh, sad and dreary was the lot of Scotland's true ones then,\r\n A famine-stricken remnant with scarce the guise of men;\r\n They burrowed few and lonely mid the chill dark mountain caves,\r\n For those who once had sheltered them were in their martyr-graves.\r\n\r\n \"A sword had rested on the land! it did not pass away;\r\n Long had they watched and waited; but there dawned no brighter day,\r\n And many had gone back from them, who owned the truth of old,\r\n Because of much iniquity their love was waxen cold.\"\r\n\r\nTo crush this growing enthusiasm (which was so great at times, that\r\nan angel was more than once averred to have been seen in mid air,\r\noverhanging a conventicle), to suppress these armed religious meetings,\r\nand enforce Episcopacy on the people, was now the ungrateful task\r\nassigned to Dalyell, to Drummond, and the Scottish standing forces, who\r\nwere all commanded by officers of high Cavalier principles, and were\r\nusually men without much scruple in obeying the orders of the king and\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at the spirit of resistance evinced by the people, and\r\nremembering perhaps the fate of his father, Charles II. changed the\r\nScottish ministry. Lauderdale had begun to persuade him that more\r\nlenient measures were necessary, and Sharpe, whom the Covenanters\r\nreceived as a Judas, retired from the administration of ecclesiastical\r\naffairs; but the change came _too late_, for again the banner which\r\nhad been displayed so victoriously of old, \"for an oppressed Kirk and\r\nbroken Covenant,\" was unfurled, and a body of the Presbyterians rose in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-colonel Sir James Turner, author of a little treatise on the\r\nart of war, and of his own Memoirs, from which we may learn that he\r\nwas a fierce and unscrupulous _sabreur_, was captured with his troops\r\nat Ayr, by the Lairds of Corsack and Barscob at the head of a few\r\nfollowers. Another party of soldiers were routed by them at Dalry, and\r\nthese insurgents began at once their march for Edinburgh, the seat of\r\ngovernment, in the autumn of 1666.\r\n\r\nThey first proposed to put Turner to death; but spared his life on\r\nCorsack discovering that his conduct to the people had been much less\r\nsevere than the written _orders_, which were found on his person, had\r\ninculcated.\r\n\r\nDalyell at this crisis commanded the king's troops in the capital. He\r\nconcentrated all the detachments which were dispersed throughout the\r\nadjacent country, and marched westward, by the Glasgow road, to meet\r\nthese insurgents, whose strength was ever varying, and whose numbers\r\nwere greatly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\"A great many came to the rebels who were called _Whiggs_,\" says\r\nBishop Burnet; \"at Lanark, in Clydesdale, they held a solemn fast\r\nday, in which, after much praying, they renewed the Covenant and set\r\nout their manifesto, in which they denied that they rose against the\r\nKing, but complained of the oppressions under which they groaned; they\r\ndesired that Episcopacy might be put down, that the Covenant might\r\nbe set up, their ministers restored to them; and then they promised\r\nthat they would be, in all other things, _the king's most obedient\r\nsubjects_.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the simple and just demands of these poor people. Dalyell\r\nfollowed them closely from place to place with his cavalry, the flower\r\nof which were the high-spirited Scottish Life Guards. He published\r\na proclamation, offering pardon to all who within twenty-four hours\r\nreturned to their own houses; but he threatened with death all who\r\nwere taken in arms after that brief period. He found the whole country\r\nso completely in the interest of the revolters, that he could obtain\r\nno intelligence of their number, intention, or movements, save the\r\nrumours brought to head quarters by his own parties and horse-patrols;\r\nand thus, while _he_ was hovering in the west, by a sudden march, they\r\nappeared unexpectedly within four miles of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nTheir number had considerably augmented during their march; but few men\r\nof any influence or property joined them; as most of the Covenanting\r\ngentry had been committed to various castles and prisons, on the\r\nplausible pre-text that it was necessary to insure their neutrality in\r\ncase of a war with the Dutch.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the vicinity of the Pentland Hills, they numbered about\r\nthree thousand horse and foot, ill armed and totally undisciplined.\r\n\r\nColonel James Wallace, of Auchans, a descendant of the Wallaces of\r\nDundonald, a brave officer, who had served with distinction in former\r\nwars, and been lieutenant-colonel of Argyle's Highland regiment in\r\nIreland--a veteran soldier, who had seen the battles of Benburb,\r\nKilsythe, and Dunbar, when he was lieutenant-colonel of the Scottish\r\nFoot Guards[34]--took command of the whole, and, knowing how slender\r\nwas his force, how destitute of succour, and how desperate in purpose\r\nand position, he left nothing undone to ensure a victory, or at least a\r\ndeath that should avenge their defeat and fall.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the secluded village of Colinton, which lies in a deep and\r\nwooded hollow, they learned that in Edinburgh, where they confidently\r\nexpected a great accession, the citizens, under their provost, Sir\r\nAndrew Ramsay, were in arms against them, and had made vigorous\r\npreparations for a defence. The barrier gates were shut and fortified\r\nby cannon; the gentlemen of the neighbouring shires had been summoned\r\nto defend the walls; the College of Justice had formed a corps of\r\ncavalry, and all gentlemen in the city who possessed horses were\r\nordered to mount, and appear in arms in the Meal Market, under the\r\nyoung Marquis of Montrose, to await the orders of General Dalyell.\r\n\r\nThe latter sent Alexander Seton, Viscount Kingston, with a body of\r\nthe Guards, to the old quarries in Bruntsfield Links, with orders to\r\nlie there concealed, as across these links lay the direct road to\r\nthe quarters of the insurgents, who had many friends in the capital;\r\nbut, overawed by the active measures of the Cavalier government,\r\nthey--according to Kirkton--\"could only fast and pray for them.\"\r\n\r\nOn learning all this, Colonel Wallace marched along the slope of the\r\nPentland Hills, in the hope of being able to effect a retreat towards\r\nBiggar. The season was the dreary month of November. Dogged by Dalyell\r\nand battered by a storm of wind and rain, the hapless Covenanters\r\nhad been losing heart, and as their spirit diminished, so did their\r\nnumbers, which, from three thousand, dwindled down to nine hundred\r\nhungry, wet, and famished creatures, \"who looked more like dying men\r\nthan soldiers going to conquer.\"\r\n\r\nWallace began to see the hopelessness of the cause he had undertaken;\r\nbut the spirit of the few who adhered to him never flinched.\r\n\r\n\"We are not unwilling to die for religion and liberty,\" said these\r\nbrave fellows; \"yea, we would esteem a testimony for the Lord and our\r\ncountry a sufficient reward for all our loss and labour.\"\r\n\r\nThey wrote to General Dalyell a long and pathetic letter, setting forth\r\ntheir religious grievances; but no answer was returned to it, save the\r\nsound of his trumpets and the clash of the kettle-drums, when, on the\r\nafternoon of the 28th of November, his cavalry and infantry--upwards\r\nof three thousand strong,--after a fortnight's constant marching, were\r\nseen traversing the western slope of the beautiful Pentland range, and,\r\ndescending, with all their standards displayed, towards Rullion Green,\r\nwhere these nine hundred devoted men, with their swords and Bibles,\r\nawaited them. As Dalyell approached, they sang the seventy-fourth and\r\nseventy-eighth Psalms.\r\n\r\nWallace drew up his little band in line, with a few of his toil-worn\r\nhorsemen covering the right flank, which was somewhat exposed.\r\nDesperation and religious enthusiasm enhanced their natural bravery,\r\nand twice they repulsed the attack of the royal troops; but it was\r\nrenewed by Dalyell's horse, the finest cavalry in Scotland, being\r\nprincipally cavaliers of the Life Guards, nobly mounted and richly\r\naccoutred. Dalyell led them on, and, by a single charge, they bore down\r\nhorse and foot alike, at sword's point. This was when the dusk was\r\nclosing on these lofty and heath-clad mountains. Fifty Covenanters were\r\nslain, including two eminent Irish divines--Andrew MacCormick and John\r\nCrookshanks--who had joined them, and who perished in the front rank.\r\n\r\nIn this conflict Dalyell and the famous Covenanter, Captain John Paton,\r\nof Meadowhead, met hand to hand on horseback, and exchanged several\r\nblows before they were separated by the pressure of their soldiers.\r\nPaton then discharged his pistols at Dalyell, off whose person the\r\nballs were seen _to recoil_. On perceiving this (and knowing him to be\r\nshot-proof, according to a superstitious historian), the captain loaded\r\nhis pistol with a _silver coin_, a manoeuvre observed by Dalyell; he\r\nstepped behind a soldier, who fell, pierced by the coin which was\r\nsupposed to be proof to any spell; but the same legend is related of\r\nClaverhouse at Killycrankie. Paton was among the last who left the\r\nfield. Dalyell perceived him retiring, and sent three well-mounted\r\ntroopers in pursuit, and these came to blows with him when he was\r\nurging his horse to leap a deep ditch. By a back-handed stroke he clove\r\nin two the head and helmet of his first assailant; the other two fell\r\nheadlong into the ditch, where they lay struggling under their fallen\r\nchargers.\r\n\r\n\"Take my compliments to Dalyell, your master,\" said Baton, tauntingly,\r\nas he rode off; \"tell him that I am not going home with him to-night.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Nesbit, of Hardhill, a tall and powerful Covenanter, fell on the\r\nfield, covered with wounds, but was found to be alive next day, when\r\nhe was stripped and about to be interred with the dead. He was a brave\r\nman, and had served in foreign wars, for which he was made a captain of\r\nMusketeers at Bothwell some years after.\r\n\r\nThe gloom of the November night, and a sentiment of chivalry--of pity,\r\nperhaps, for their poor and persecuted countrymen--inspired the Life\r\nGuards to spare the fugitives, the mass of whom escaped and dispersed;\r\nbut eighty prisoners--among whom was Neilson, the unfortunate Laird\r\nof Corsack--were taken, and these were next day marched in triumph\r\nthrough the streets of Edinburgh, while cannon thundered a salute from\r\nthe castle, and the bells rang in every steeple; while the streets\r\nresounded with the tramp of the cavalry, who, with standards advanced\r\nand kettle-drums beating, escorted them to prison. \"It is recorded\r\nthat Andrew Murray, an aged Presbyterian minister, when he beheld the\r\nferocious Dalyell in his rusted head-piece, buff coat, and long waving\r\nbeard, riding at the head of his cavalier squadrons, who, flushed with\r\nvictory, surrounded the manacled prisoners with drawn swords and cocked\r\ncarbines--and when he heard the shouts of acclamation from the people,\r\nwas so overpowered with grief for what he deemed the downfall for ever\r\nof _God's Covenanted Kirk_, that he became ill, and expired.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead were buried on the field, and there may yet be seen, within\r\na small and rude enclosure, which is overshadowed by a few trees,\r\na monument bearing an inscription to the memory of Crookshanks,\r\nMacCormick, and others who lie where they fell. At the back of the\r\nPentland Hills runs a rivulet named the Deadman's-grain, from the\r\ncircumstance of a wounded Covenanter falling there when pursued by a\r\ncavalier trooper. Drawing a pistol from his holsters, he fired it at\r\nhis pursuer underneath his bridle arm, but, missing, shot his own horse\r\nin the flank. The animal fell, and his rider was immediately slain,\r\nwhere his green grave is yet shown by the side of the mountain burn.\r\n\r\nAt Easton, in Dunsyre, there was long visible a lonely grave, in which,\r\naccording to a tradition transmitted from father to son, there lay a\r\nCovenanter who had expired of wounds received at Rullion Green. It was\r\nopened in 1817, and found to contain the skeleton of a tall man, with\r\ntwo silver coins dated 1620. On being touched, the bones crumbled to\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nColonel Wallace, on seeing all lost, left the field, accompanied by\r\nMr. John Welsh, and, favoured by the darkness, took a north-westerly\r\ndirection among the hills, and escaped. After long concealment and\r\nenduring many privations, he reached the Continent, and died in penury,\r\nat Rotterdam, in 1678.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange circumstance that, after the rout of his followers,\r\nmany of them were slain by the Lothian peasantry.\r\n\r\nOf the unfortunate prisoners, the servile and barbarous Scottish Privy\r\nCouncil made a severe example. Twenty were executed at Edinburgh, ten\r\nbeing hanged upon the same gibbet at once; seven were executed at Ayr,\r\nand many were hanged before their own doors in other parts of the\r\ncountry. The heads of those who perished at Edinburgh were fixed above\r\nthe city gates, and their right arms and the hands with which they\r\nsubscribed the Covenant were affixed to the Tolbooths of Lanark and\r\nother towns.\r\n\r\nWhen Gordon, of Knockbreck, and his brother were hanged on the same\r\ngibbet, they clasped each other in their arms, that together, and at\r\nonce, they might endure the pangs of death.\r\n\r\nLike all Covenanters, the whole of these men maintained, with their\r\ndying breath, that they had taken up arms _not_ against the king, but\r\nagainst the insupportable tyranny of the Episcopal prelates. And that\r\nthese men, and such as these, did not die in vain, the future history\r\nof their country has shown, for their last words left an echo that\r\nlingers yet in the hearts of the people.\r\n\r\nDalyell was highly complimented by the Council for this victory, and\r\nNeilson of Corsack, the most important of his prisoners, was ordered\r\nto be tortured in that dark, panelled room under the Parliament Hall,\r\nwherein sat the Council, over which the Duke of Rothes presided.\r\n\r\nNeilson of Corsack was a country laird, who had been long distinguished\r\nfor gentleness and amiability of disposition; but rage at the\r\nill-treatment he received from the new clergy alone drove him to\r\ndespair, and from despair to arms. On his refusal to become an\r\nEpiscopalian, by the information (or at the instance) of the curate\r\nof his parish, he was dragged from his house, fined, and imprisoned,\r\nwhile his delicate wife and little children had been driven as outcasts\r\ninto the mountains. Soldiers were then quartered on his lands, and his\r\ncattle were carried off. This was scarcely such treatment as a Scottish\r\ngentleman of the seventeenth century would endure with calmness.\r\nRendered desperate, Corsack took to his sword, and commanded the party\r\nwhich surprised Sir James Turner, whose life he subsequently saved.\r\nThat officer was not ungrateful for the act, and did all in his power\r\nto obtain mercy for him, but in vain. The Council were inexorable, and\r\n\"Corsack was so cruelly tortured by the iron boots, that his shrieks\r\nwere sufficient to move the heart of a stone.\"\r\n\r\nThe _thumbikins_ were the favourite instrument of torture most\r\ngenerally resorted to by the Lords of Council. These were small steel\r\nscrews which compressed the thumb-joint, or whole hand if necessary,\r\nand were an invention brought to Scotland by General Dalyell from the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nCharles II. distinctly, by letter, ordained the Privy Council to\r\nsubstitute banishment for torture and death; but his _missive was\r\nconcealed_, and in his name the work of cruelty still went on, and\r\nstill unsated by the daily horrors furnished by the result of the\r\nconflict at Rullion Green, Generals Dalyell and Drummond were ordered\r\ninto the Shires of Ayr, Dumfries, and Galloway, to complete the\r\ndestruction of any Covenanters or recusants who might remain in these\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nIn this year, and most probably for that duty, he raised a regiment of\r\ninfantry; but it has long ceased to exist, and was probably one of the\r\nmany Scottish corps disbanded at the peace of Ryswick.\r\n\r\nWhile on this new service the enemies of Dalyell record innumerable\r\ninstances of cruelty perpetrated by him; and though his temper was hot\r\nand his character undoubtedly fierce and resolute, these stories must\r\nbe accepted under reservation.\r\n\r\n\"The forces were ordered to lie in the west,\" says Burnet, \"where\r\nDalyell acted the Muscovite too grossly. He threatened to _spit_ men\r\nand to _roast_ them, and he killed some in cold blood, or rather hot\r\nblood, for he was then drunk, when he ordered one to be hanged because\r\nhe would not tell where his father was, for whom he was in search. When\r\nhe heard of any who did not go to church, he did not trouble himself\r\nto set a fine upon him, but sent as many soldiers as might eat him up\r\nin a night. And the clergy were so delighted with it, that they used\r\nto speak of that time as the poets do of the golden age. They looked\r\nupon the soldiery as their patrons. They were ever in their company,\r\nand complying with them in their excesses, and, if they are not much\r\nwronged, they rather led them into them, than checked them for them.\r\n_Dalyell_ himself and his officers were so disgusted with them, that\r\nthey increased the complaints, that had now more credit from them than\r\nfrom those of the country, who were looked on as their enemies. Things\r\nof so strange a pitch in vice were told of them, that they seemed\r\nscarce credible.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this severe picture of the Episcopal Clergy is given by a Scottish\r\nBishop, which renders it the more worthy of credence.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded of Dalyell, that once, when inflamed by passion, he\r\nstruck a prisoner on the face with the hilt of his dagger so severely\r\nthat blood flowed from the wound but it must be remembered that this\r\nperson had boldly taunted the fierce old man, as \"a Muscovite beast\r\nwho used to roast men alive!\" He established his head-quarters at\r\nLanark for some weeks, and there he imprisoned many Covenanters in a\r\ndamp dungeon, which was so narrow that, owing to their number, they\r\ncould neither sit nor lie at length with comfort; and where they were\r\ndeprived of all accommodation for preserving cleanliness or decency.\r\n\r\nWhile his troops were in this town, a peasant when passing through the\r\nstreets was seized by a patrol, and brought before him; and because\r\nthis man either could not, or would not, give such information as would\r\ncommit some of the prisoners, he was condemned to instant death. He\r\nbegged one night's reprieve, that he might prepare to die, and make his\r\npeace with Heaven; but even this was denied him, and, according to the\r\nhistorians of the Kirk, he was dragged into a neighbouring field, shot\r\ndead by a platoon of carbines, stripped and left nude upon the ground.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, we are told that he ordered a woman, who had aided\r\nthe escape of a fugitive, to be cast into a hole filled with toads and\r\nreptiles, where she died in great misery.\r\n\r\nSuch stories seem exceedingly improbable, yet they pass current in\r\nScotland, and are still believed to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn Dumfries the soldiers were accused of \"having tied a man neck and\r\nheels to a pole, and turned him like a joint of meat before a great\r\nfire.\" In Kilmarnock, the men of Dalyell's regiment placed an old\r\nrecusant in a dungeon, which was destitute of vent or chimney, and\r\nthere tortured him by the smoke of a coal fire. When almost suffocated\r\nhe was borne forth, amid laughter and derision, to the open air, and\r\npermitted to revive. After this he was imprisoned again; and this\r\ntorture was continued for several nights and days.\r\n\r\nAt Dalry, Sir William Bannatyne, one of Dalyell's officers, ordered\r\na woman who had been accessory to the escape of her husband, to be\r\ntortured by having lighted musket-matches tied between her clenched\r\nfingers, a cruelty by which she lost one hand entirely, and some\r\ndays afterwards expired of torture. A farmer, whom this officer was\r\ndragooning, and from whom he was extorting money, asked why he was thus\r\nfined.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied Sir William, with provoking candour, \"you have great\r\ngear, and I must have part of it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd on service so barbarous as this, the year 1667 passed away; and the\r\nestates of the forfeited Wallace of Auchans and others were bestowed by\r\nParliament upon Dalyell and Drummond, or were retained by the grasping\r\nofficers of State to enrich themselves. Thus for a time the unhappy\r\nCovenanters seemed to be completely crushed. Upon Dalyell was conferred\r\nthe valuable estate of Mure of Caldwell, who had been accessory to that\r\nrevolt which terminated at the Pentland hills; but of this property\r\nhis family were deprived by the Revolution of 1688. Those who made\r\npeace with the Government, by interest, bribery, or fines, received\r\nprotections, of which the following, in my own possession, granted the\r\nyear before Bothwell, may serve as an example:--\r\n\r\n \"At Glasgow, the twenty day of March, 1678.\r\n\r\n \"For saemeikelas Major Alexander Coult of Garturke, in the parish of\r\n Monkland, hath signed the bond appoynted by the Lords of His Maties\r\n Privy Councell ffor himself and all such who live under him, ffor\r\n their peaceable and orderlie deportment; the Comitty of His Maties\r\n Privy Councell do hereby take the said Major Alexander Coult under\r\n their special protection and safeguard: and hereby discharge all\r\n officers and souldiers to trouble or molest the said Major Alexander\r\n Coult, his house, famillie, tenants, cottars or servants, or any\r\n belonging to him, in their personal gudes or estate, as they will be\r\n answerable at their highest perill, and allows him _to have and wear\r\n his wearing sword and pistolls_.\r\n\r\n \"Glencairne,\r\n \"Strathmore,       Wigtoune,\r\n \"Airlie,           Caithness.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain John Creichton, the celebrated cavalier trooper, who served\r\nlong, both as a private and officer, under Dalyell in Scotland, and\r\nwhose interesting memoirs were published by Dean Swift, has left us\r\nthe following portrait of his stern leader, and it is so graphic that I\r\nmay be pardoned quoting it entire.\r\n\r\n\"He was bred up very hardy from his youth, both in diet and clothing.\r\nHe never wore boots, nor above one coat, which was close to his body,\r\nwith close sleeves like those we call jockey coats. He never wore a\r\nperuke, nor did he shave his beard since the murder of King Charles\r\nthe First. In my time his head was bald, which he covered only with a\r\nbeaver hat, the brim of which was not above three inches broad. His\r\nbeard was white and bushy, and yet reached down almost to his girdle.\r\nHe usually went to London once or twice in a year to kiss the King's\r\nhand, who had a great esteem for his valor and worth. His unusual dress\r\nand figure, when he was in London, never failed to draw after him a\r\ngreat crowd of boys and other young people, who constantly attended at\r\nhis lodgings, and followed him with huzzas, as he went to court and\r\nreturned from it. As he was a man of humour, he would always thank them\r\nfor their civilities when he left them at the door to go to the King,\r\nand would let them know exactly at what hour he intended to come out\r\nagain and return to his lodgings.\r\n\r\n\"When the King walked in the park attended by some of his courtiers,\r\nand Dalziel in his company, the same crowds would always be after him,\r\nshewing their admiration at his beard and dress, so that the King could\r\nhardly pass on for the crowd, upon which his Majesty bade '_the devil\r\ntake Dalziel for bringing such a rabble of boys together to have their\r\nguts squeezed out_,' while they gaped at his long beard and antique\r\nhabit, requesting him at the same time--as Dalziel used to express\r\nit--'_to shave and dress like other Christians, and keep the poor\r\nbairns out of danger_.' All this could never prevail on him to part\r\nwith his beard; but yet, in compliance to his Majesty, he went once to\r\nCourt in the very height of the fashion; but as soon as the King and\r\nthose about him had laughed sufficiently at the strange figure he made,\r\nhe resumed his usual habit, to the great joy of the boys, who had not\r\ndiscovered him in his fashionable dress.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it would appear that Dalyell had been much of a wag, that he\r\nloved to humour children, and enjoyed their fun and amazement at the\r\nsight of his huge beard, and by appearing once in the gaudy frippery of\r\na Cavalier, had striven to ridicule the foppery of the Court of Charles\r\nII.--three points of character very different from those usually\r\nattributed to him.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed a Privy Councillor, and soon after represented the\r\ncounty of Linlithgow in Parliament, and in 1670 an act of ratification,\r\nconfirming all his estates and honours, was passed. In this document he\r\nis designated \"His Majesties right trustie and weel-beloved Generall\r\nThomas Dalyell, of Binns, late Lieutenant-Generall of His Majesties\r\nlate forces within this ancient kingdome.\" From this it would appear\r\nthat promotion, as well as profit, had resulted to him after the affair\r\nat Rullion Green and dragooning the Westland Whigs. He represented his\r\nnative county in the Scottish Parliament from 1678 to 1685.\r\n\r\nTo assist in the security of Episcopacy in Scotland, and still further\r\nto fortify the royal authority and the power of that tyrannical\r\nCouncil, which committed so many atrocities in the king's name,\r\nLauderdale, who was created a duke when at the head of the Scottish\r\naffairs, obtained the formation of a militia consisting of two thousand\r\ncavalry and sixteen thousand infantry; and as the northern kingdom\r\nswarmed with experienced and high-spirited officers all lacking\r\nmilitary employment, these troops were soon disciplined and equipped;\r\nbut the flower of the national troops were the standing forces of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese, at this time, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The Royal Life Guards, the regiment of the famous John Grahame of\r\nClaverhouse, Viscount of Dundee, were raised after the Restoration,\r\nin 1661. The privates were styled, _par excellence_, gentlemen, and\r\nusually appear to have been cadets of good families. The Sieur de la\r\nRoche, a French Protestant refugee, who was slain in a tavern brawl\r\nat Leith by John Master of Tarbet and an Ensign Mowat, is styled in\r\ntheir indictment, \"a gentleman of his Majesty's troop of Guards.\" Under\r\nClaverhouse, this Scottish patrician band served at Bothwell Bridge,\r\nat Drumclog, and in all the unhappy contentions of the period. Mr.\r\nFrancis Stuart, afterwards a captain of the Guards, grandson of the\r\nEarl of Bothwell, was, says Captain Creichton, \"a private _gentleman_\r\nin the Horse Guards, like myself.\" In this trooper the reader will no\r\ndoubt recognise the Serjeant Bothwell of _Old Mortality_.\r\n\r\n\"On the 2nd of April, 1661,\" according to Wodrow, \"the King's Life\r\nGuard was formed. By their constitution they were to consist of\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen's sons, and were to be one hundred and twenty in\r\nnumber, under command of the Lord Newburgh. After taking an oath to be\r\nloyal to his Majesty, they made a parade through the town of Edinburgh,\r\nwith carbines at their saddles and swords drawn.\"\r\n\r\nThe maimed and old veteran officers, adds Kirkton, in his secret\r\nhistory, \"the poor colonels, majors, and captains who expected great\r\npromotion (at the Restoration) were preferred to be troopers in the\r\nKing's troop of Life Guards. This goodly employment obliged them to\r\nspend with one another the small remnant of the stock their miseries\r\nhad left them, but more they could not have after all their hopes and\r\nsufferings\" (he means) during the days of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nIn 1674 these Life Guards consisted of four squadrons, and were\r\ncommanded by the Marquis of Athole.\r\n\r\nAfter the Union, in 1707, this corps was removed to London, and is now\r\nrepresented by the 2nd troop of the 1st Life Guards.[35]\r\n\r\n2. The Scottish Foot Guards, raised in November, 1660, were commanded\r\nby George, Earl of Linlithgow, and were, as they are still, named\r\nFusiliers, being armed with the _fusil_, a light French musket; and by\r\nthe Scottish Privy Council, in their orders to the army in 1667, it was\r\nordained that the field officers of this corps should command in chief,\r\nand give orders in field and garrison, to all troops whatsoever. In\r\n1707 these Guards were placed upon the united British establishment;\r\nin February, 1712, they were marched to London; in the following year\r\nthey shared the duties for the _first_ time with the English Guards,\r\nand have _never been in Scotland since_.[36]\r\n\r\n3. The Royal Regiment, known of old as the Scottish Archers in France,\r\nwas at this time abroad at Tangiers, and did not return until 1682,\r\nwhen it arrived in Rochester, reduced to sixteen companies, and after\r\nthe battle of Sedgemoor was sent into Holland.\r\n\r\n4. The Earl of Mar's regiment, which served at Bothwell Bridge, was\r\nremodelled in 1689, and now known as the 21st Fusiliers.\r\n\r\n5. The infantry regiment of Dalyell is no longer in existence, but\r\nLeven's Scottish regiment is now known as the 25th, or Royal Borderers;\r\nAngus's Foot--the regiment of our old friend, Uncle Toby--is numbered\r\nas the 26th, or Cameronians; and the regiment of Argyle, infamous as\r\nthe perpetrators of the Glencoe tragedy, is no longer in the service.\r\n\r\n6. The Scottish train of artillery, commanded by the Laird of Lundin\r\nin 1687, was disbanded at the Union, when Lord Leven was its general,\r\nand the last survivor of it, then an old man, served as a volunteer,\r\nwith Sir John Cope's army, at Preston Pans. In this corps was a strange\r\nrank, named \"gentlemen of the cannon,\" as we may learn from a letter of\r\nViscount Teviot, dated 1699, and printed among Carstare's State Papers.\r\n\r\nAt the union with England, in 1707, it would seem to have been arranged\r\nthat Scotland should have the first regiment of infantry, theirs being\r\nthe oldest, and that England should have the first regiment of Dragoons.\r\n\r\nThe severity with which Dalyell and Drummond treated the Covenanters\r\nwith these regular troops drove them frantic.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1677, the former despatched John Creichton, one of his\r\nmost active, favourite, and relentless troopers, with an ensign and\r\nfifty soldiers of the Foot Guards, to seize Adam Stobie, of Luscar,\r\nnear Culross, in Fife, \"a fellow who,\" as the captain says, \"had gone\r\nthrough the west, endeavouring to stir up sedition in the people by his\r\ngreat skill in canting and praying.\"\r\n\r\nAfter surrounding his house in the night, the unfortunate Covenanter\r\nwas discovered in concealment under some straw in a lime-kiln, from\r\nwhence he was at once dragged forth. His daughter, in tears and terror,\r\nbesought mercy of Creichton, and offered to ransom her father for two\r\nhundred dollars; but the trooper knew too well the inflexibility of his\r\ngeneral, and, though not always insensible either to the voice of a\r\nwoman or the offer of a handsome sum, he marched back to Edinburgh, and\r\npresented Stobie to Dalyell, together with four other recusants, who\r\nhad been found in Culross by the Ensign of the Guards.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of February, the General brought his prisoners before\r\nthe Privy Council, who fined Stobie three thousand marks for keeping\r\nconventicles and _conversing_ with intercommuned persons. After paying\r\nthis he was to be transported; but he saved their lordships further\r\ntrouble on his account by breaking from his prison and escaping in the\r\nnight. After this he joined in the next rising, and is believed to have\r\nbeen slain at Bothwell Bridge, as he was never heard of afterwards.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Francis Stuart, the Earl of Bothwell's grandson,\r\nwas recommended by Dalyell to Charles II. for a commission, and was\r\nappointed Captain of Horse with John Creichton, who had hitherto been\r\nwith him in the Life Guards, as his lieutenant, and these officers\r\nserved under Colonel Graham, of Claverhouse, at the battle of Drumclog;\r\nfor after the murder of Archbishop Sharpe on Magus Muir, the armed\r\nfield conventicles had increased in every part of the country, and\r\ndiscontent, with sullen desperation, were rapidly moulding the people\r\ninto a mass that was ready for revolt. Conflicts with the soldiers were\r\nof daily occurrence, and many of them were barbarously murdered, in\r\nlonely billets and solitary parts of the country, by the more savage\r\nor fanatical of the hill men, as the recusants were named, from their\r\nhabit of usually lurking in the mountains.\r\n\r\nSuperstition was not wanting to lend a darker and more terrible hue to\r\nthe events of the time, as Scotland is peculiarly the land of omens.\r\nAtmospheric visions were everywhere visible, if we are to believe such\r\nold memorialists as Law and others.\r\n\r\nAt Kilbryde, near Glasgow, two armies were seen in the sky, firing\r\nplatoons of musketry at each other; \"the fyre and smock were seen, but\r\nwithout noise or crak.\" On the slope of a lonely hill near Eastwood\r\nMuir, the tall apparition of a blood-red spectre was seen to tower\r\nsuddenly between the terrified beholders and the blue sky, while a\r\ndreadful voice exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Woe! Woe unto the land!\"\r\n\r\nAt a conventicle, suppressed in Fife by Adam Masterton of Grange,\r\nan officer of the Life Guards, the fugitive women, who observed the\r\nconflict from a distance, asserted that they could perceive, to their\r\nawe and terror, \"the form of a tall man of majestic stature,\" hovering\r\nin mid air \"above the people all the while of the soldiers shooting.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1678, the devil, who seemed always in those days to take\r\na deep interest in Scottish affairs, held a great meeting of witches\r\nand warlocks in Lothian, \"where,\" saith the veracious Law, \"there\r\nwas a warlock who formerly had been admitted to the ministry in the\r\nPresbyterian times, and who, when the bishops came in, conformed with\r\n_them_; but being deposed, he now turns under the devil, a preacher of\r\nhellish doctrine.\" In the March of the same year, he adds, a tremendous\r\nvoice was heard in the ancient and half-ruined Abbey of Paisley,\r\nexclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"Woe, woe, woe! Pray, pray, pray!\"\r\n\r\nShowers of blood and of Highland bonnets, afforded the crones,\r\nelsewhere, ample matter for discussion and wonder.\r\n\r\nAmid all this absurdity, while the tyrant Lords of Council tortured and\r\nhung peasants and preachers, of ruined honourable and long-descended\r\nfamilies, for worshipping God as their hearts desired, and for doing\r\nso, in wild and sequestered places, or for refusing to say God save a\r\nKing, who was _uncovenanted_; while Dalyell had every satanic power\r\nattributed to him, and the black charger of Claverhouse was believed\r\nto be the veritable devil himself, the efforts of some to promote\r\ngodliness in the land were alike melancholy and amusing; thus people\r\nwere punished for taking snuff in time of sermon, for carrying water on\r\nthe Sabbath day, and for a thousand charges equally frivolous.\r\n\r\nTo repress the conventicles which began to assume a more formidable\r\naspect, from the number of armed men who attended them, additional\r\ngarrisons were established. Two peers and ten barons, who were\r\nobnoxious to Lauderdale, were lawlessly dispossessed of their mansions,\r\nwhich were converted into military stations. In each of these Dalyell\r\nplaced a company of infantry and ten troopers, who were supplied with\r\neverything by provincial assessment or military contribution. Fathers\r\nwere made responsible for their children; husbands for their wives;\r\nmagistrates for their citizens; landlords for their tenants; and thus,\r\nby a network of military tyranny, it was resolved that at the sword's\r\npoint, Scotland should become a highly episcopal country. Five hundred\r\nmarks were offered for the seizure of any one who held a religious\r\nmeeting; and four thousand pounds sterling was an ordinary price for\r\nthe head of a good preacher. Others were valued according to their\r\nreputation among the people; and under such laws as these the troops of\r\nhis sacred Majesty King Charles made plenty of prize-money and plunder.\r\n\r\nThe barbarities to which the people were subjected at last attracted\r\nthe attention of the English House of Commons, who appointed a\r\ncommittee to inquire into these affairs, and into the Act empowering\r\nthe Privy Council at Edinburgh to march the Scottish army wheresoever\r\nthey chose; but there the matter ended. The Government was then\r\n_federal_, and any interference might have caused another national\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nRoused at last to more open resistance, a body of these poor people\r\nappealed again to that which of old was ever the Scotsman's best and\r\nmost ready argument--the sword--and the defeat of Claverhouse's cavalry\r\nat Drumclog was deemed a sure omen of great events to come. They\r\nestablished their camp at Hamilton, and unfurled a standard, which is\r\nstill preserved at Edinburgh. It is blue, crossed by the white saltire\r\nof St. Andrew, and is inscribed--\r\n\r\n \"COVENANTS--RELIGION--KING AND KINGDOMES.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Hamilton, of Preston, a brave but intolerant and injudicious\r\nman, assumed the command. He was without experience as a leader, and\r\nhis followers were destitute of all discipline as soldiers; hence\r\ndissensions were of hourly occurrence in the camp.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the tidings of this rising, the end of which no one could\r\nthen foresee, the King sent his son James, Duke of Monmouth and\r\nBuccleugh, to assume command of the Scottish troops, and enforce the\r\nrestoration of order. The duke brought with him four troops of English\r\nhorse, commanded by a Major Main, a novelty which did not increase his\r\npopularity in Scotland, where English troops had not been seen since\r\nCromwell's time. At the head of ten thousand men, with a fine park of\r\nartillery, he marched westward at midsummer, against the insurgents.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the duke being made commander-in-chief, Dalyell refused to serve\r\nunder him,\" says Captain Creichton, \"and remained at his lodgings\r\nin Edinburgh, till his Grace was superseded, which happened about a\r\nfortnight after.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal officers in the kingdom attended the duke on this\r\nexpedition. Among them were the Earl of Linlithgow, with his regiment\r\nof Foot Guards; the Earl of Mar, with his regiment of Fusiliers; the\r\nMarquis of Montrose, the Earls of Airley and Home, and Graham of\r\nClaverhouse, all commanders of horse; while a host of cavalier nobles\r\nand gentlemen attended him to serve as he might require.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd of June, he found the Covenanters in position at the\r\nbridge of Bothwell, where the Clyde is seventy-one yards wide. This\r\npicturesque old bridge was twelve feet broad, and one hundred and\r\ntwenty feet long, with a rise of twenty in the centre, where there\r\nwas a barrier gate, which was removed in 1826. This gate Preston had\r\nbarricaded, while flanking the approaches with musketry. To three\r\nhundred stout hearts led by Hackston of Rathillet, and the stern John\r\nBalfour of Kinloch, otherwise styled of Burley, was confided the\r\nkeeping of the bridge, and well these brave men kept it too, under a\r\nheavy fire of cannon and musketry, to which the flankers of the bridge\r\nreplied by firing briskly from behind the thickets of alder and hazel\r\ntrees which clothed the banks of the stream.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of a cannonade, Lord Livingstone led the assault, at\r\nthe head of his father's regiment, the Scottish Foot Guards, and\r\ndespite its barricade of stones and timber, and all the efforts of\r\nits desperate defenders, the gate was stormed by the infantry, and\r\nthe bridge was carried by the clubbed musket and levelled pike,\r\nafter a fierce contest. Then a body of the Lennox Highlanders,\r\nled, say some authorities, by General Dalyell; by their own chief,\r\nMacfarlane, say others, raised the war-cry of _Loch sloy_ and flung\r\nthemselves, claymore in hand, on the main body of the Covenanters,\r\nwhile Claverhouse with the Life Guards--all burning to avenge their\r\nrecent defeat at Drumclog--defiled across the bridge at full speed,\r\nand forming in squadron on the opposite side, swept all before them,\r\nas they might have driven a flock of sheep. Main's English dragoons\r\nand the Highlanders are accused of behaving with great barbarity in\r\nslaughtering the fugitives. The aged Laird of Earlstone prayed for\r\nquarter from Major Main, who ran him through the body and slew him on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nWhen the charge was over, the gentlemen of the Scottish Life Guards\r\nbecame so exasperated on seeing the Covenanters treated thus by\r\nEnglishmen, that they fell, sword in hand, upon Main's dragoons, and\r\ncut many of them down, \"being grieved,\" as the Rev. John Blackadder has\r\nit, \"to see Englishmen delighting so much to shed their countrymen's\r\nblood.\"\r\n\r\nIn the streets of Hamilton the reckless Balfour of Burley made a bold\r\nattempt to rally the fugitives; but a musket-ball broke his sword arm,\r\nas his troopers reined up their horses in the thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\"Withered be the hand that fired the shot--I can fight no longer now!\"\r\nhe exclaimed in bitterness, as the weapon fell from his grasp, and once\r\nmore the flight was renewed.\r\n\r\nFour hundred Covenanters were slain on the field, and twelve hundred\r\nwere made prisoners; these, on the evening after the battle, were\r\nmarched to Edinburgh, where they were thrust into the Greyfriars\r\nchurchyard, like sheep penned in a fold. Some were selected for the\r\nscaffold, the rest were banished to the plantations, and of these many\r\nperished miserably at sea.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit was scarcely over and the troops returned to their various\r\ncolours, when old General Dalyell, on horseback and in fiery haste,\r\nlest the fighting should all be over, arrived from Edinburgh, with a\r\nnew commission appointing _him_ commander-in-chief. This document,\r\nwhich he had received by express from London, was dated 22nd June,\r\n1679, the very day of the encounter. It did not, however, entirely\r\nsupersede the authority of the Duke of Monmouth, who by the Privy\r\nCouncil was styled \"Lord General.\" Dalyell is said to have publicly\r\nupbraided the gentle duke with his clemency to the prisoners, and\r\nfor the tenor of the orders he issued before the battle. These were,\r\nto yield quarter to all who asked it, to make as many prisoners as\r\npossible, and to spare life.\r\n\r\n\"Had _my_ commission come _before_ the battle,\" said Dalyell, grimly,\r\n\"these rogues should never more have troubled the king or country.\"\r\n\r\nHe marched the troops to Glasgow, and three days afterwards--the\r\ninsurrection being deemed at an end--they were dispersed in detachments\r\nthroughout the Lowlands, most of them being sent to where they were far\r\nfrom welcome--their old quarters.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle, Dalyell captured the Reverend John King, a preacher\r\nwho had once been chaplain to the exiled Lord Cardross. This gentleman\r\nhe sent in irons to Edinburgh, escorted by a guard of Main's dragoons,\r\nand on their march from Glasgow there occurred a strange accident,\r\nwhich the people believed to be a visitation of Heaven. One of these\r\ntroopers, at a wayside alehouse, drank, \"Confusion to the Covenant!\"\r\nand being asked \"where he was going,\"\r\n\r\n\"I am carrying King to hell,\" said he, an answer likely enough to be\r\nmade by a reckless soldier.\r\n\r\n\"The judgment of Heaven did not linger on this wretch,\" records the\r\nsuperstitious Wodrow; \"he had not proceeded many paces on his journey,\r\nwhen his horse stumbled, his carbine went off and shot him dead.\"\r\n\r\nKing perished on the gibbet soon after, and had his head and right hand\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nIn the winter after the battle, Dalyell quartered himself at\r\nKilmarnock, with one battalion of Linlithgow's Foot Guards, and the\r\nhorse troops of the Earl of Airlie and Captain Francis Stuart of\r\nBothwell.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" says Captain Creichton, \"the general, one day happening to look\r\non while I was exercising the troop of dragoons, asked me when I had\r\ndone, whether I knew any one of my men who was skilful in praying well\r\nin the style and tone of the Covenanters? I immediately thought upon\r\none named James Gibb, who had been born in Ireland, and whom I had made\r\na dragoon. This man I brought to the general, assuring his Excellency\r\n'that if I had raked hell, I could not find his match in mimicking the\r\nCovenanters.' Whereupon the general gave him five pounds to buy him a\r\ngreatcoat and a bonnet, and commanded him to find out the rebels, but\r\nbe sure to take care of himself among them.\r\n\r\n\"The dragoon went eight miles off that very night, and got admittance\r\ninto the house of a notorious rebel, pretending he had come from\r\nIreland out of zeal for the cause, to assist at the fight of Bothwell\r\nBridge, and could not find an opportunity since of returning with\r\nsafety; and therefore, after bewitching the family with his gifts of\r\npraying, he was conveyed in the dusk of the evening by a guide to the\r\nhouse of the next adjoining rebel, and thus in the same manner from one\r\nto another, till in a month's time he got through the principal of them\r\nin the west, telling the general at his return, that he 'made the old\r\nwives, in their devout fits, tear off their biggonets and mutches;' he\r\nlikewise gave the general a list of their names and places of abode,\r\nand into the bargain brought back a good purse of money in his pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"How used you to pray among them?\" asked Dalyell.\r\n\r\n\"It was my custom in my prayers,\" replied the trooper, \"to send the\r\nking, the ministers of state, the officers of the army, with all their\r\nsoldiers and the episcopal clergy, all at one broadside to hell; but\r\nparticularly our general himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" exclaimed the general, \"did you also send _me_ to hell, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yea,\" replied the unabashed dragoon, \"you at the head of them as their\r\nleader.\"\r\n\r\nThis discreditable abuse of hospitality and breach of faith in the\r\nsoldier is recorded as a piece of admirable tact and strategy by\r\nCreichton, and doubtless Dalyell would make good use of the notes\r\nsupplied to him.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, in the following year, 1680, Dalyell sent\r\nCreichton with thirty of Airlie's horse, and fifty of Strachan's\r\ndragoons, under Captain Bruce of Earlshall, to capture or kill a\r\nhundred and fifty Covenanters, who, since the fight at Bothwell, had\r\nbeen lurking in the wilds of Galloway. These unfortunates, after being\r\ntracked from place to place by Bruce and Creichton, made a stand\r\nagainst them at Airsmoss, near Muirkirk, on the 22nd July, and there\r\nthese desperate men fought as only the homeless and the outlawed,\r\nthe brave and the foredoomed, can fight; but they were routed, and\r\nfourteen of them were taken prisoners. Among these was David Hackston,\r\nof Rathillet, who had been present at the murder of the Archbishop of\r\nSt. Andrews. Sixty were slain, and one of these was Richard Cameron, a\r\npreacher, and formerly a schoolmaster at Falkland, for whose capture\r\nfive thousand marks had long been offered by the government at\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"Lord!\" he exclaimed, before the cavalry charged; \"Lord, spare the\r\ngreen and take the ripe! Come on,\" he added, drawing his sword, \"let us\r\nfight it out to the last. This is the day I longed for! This is the\r\ndeath I have prayed for; to die fighting against the avowed enemies of\r\nthe Lord.\"\r\n\r\nHe was shot and buried in the moss, where his grave is still shown;\r\nbut his head and hands were conveyed by Creichton to head-quarters. So\r\nperished this enthusiast; but he bequeathed his name to a sect from\r\nwhich the 26th Scottish Regiment of the Line still takes its title of\r\n_the Cameronians_.\r\n\r\nWith a barbarity worthy of the Sepoy mutineers his head and hands were\r\nexhibited to his aged father, then a prisoner in the gloomy Tolbooth\r\nof Edinburgh, and tauntingly he was asked, if he knew to whom they had\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" said the old man, as he wept and kissed the bloody relics;\r\n\"they are my son's--my dear son's--but good is the will of the Lord!\"\r\n\r\nAfter this revolting incident, they were fixed to the Netherbow-porte,\r\nthe eastern gate of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nCaptains Bruce and Creichton had also brought with them from Airsmoss\r\nthe Laird of Rathillet, who had received many wounds in the skirmish.\r\nHe was personally questioned by Dalyell, who is said to have threatened\r\nto roast him, because his answers to certain queries were brief,\r\nsullen, and unsatisfactory. Covenanting writers add, that the general\r\nrefused to permit Hackston's wounds to be dressed, and ordered him\r\nto be chained to the floor of his dungeon till he was conveyed to\r\nEdinburgh, where he was executed by prolonged tortures with a barbarity\r\nthat had never been equalled, even in those days.\r\n\r\nAmong others seized by Dalyell was John Spreul, an apothecary in\r\nGlasgow, whom he brought before the Council, and accused of being\r\nconcerned in the fight at Bothwell. His leg was put in the iron boot,\r\nand at each query the headsman gave the wedges five strokes with a\r\nmallet. \"Dalyell,\" says Wodrow, \"complained that he did not strike\r\nstrongly enough; upon which, he (the torturer) offered himself the\r\nmallet, saying he struck with all his might.\" Spreul was afterwards\r\nimprisoned on the Bass Rock, where he remained for six years.\r\n\r\nAmid the many instances of severity attributed to Dalyell, I must not\r\nomit to record one of a different kind.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated prisoner taken at Bothwell was Captain John Paton,\r\nof Meadowhead, who served under Gustavus Adolphus, and had fought at\r\nKilsythe against Montrose, where he had displayed remarkable bravery\r\nand skill in the use of his sword. Dalyell was present when this fine\r\nold veteran was examined before the Privy Council. On this occasion a\r\nsoldier had the rudeness to taunt him with being \"a rebel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" retorted Paton, \"I have done more for the King perhaps than you\r\nhave done--I fought for him at Worcester.\"\r\n\r\nSome humane impression or soldierly emotion stirred the heart of\r\nDalyell at these words.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, John, you are right--that is true,\" said he: and striking the\r\nsoldier with his cane, added, \"I will teach you, sirrah, other manners,\r\nthan to abuse a prisoner such as this.\" He then expressed sorrow for\r\nPaton's situation, and said he would have set him at liberty had his\r\nactions not been subject to the control of others; \"but,\" he added, \"I\r\nwill yet write to the King, and crave at least your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" replied the unmoved Covenanter; \"but you will not be\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that he obtained a reprieve for Paton, but was unable to\r\nsave his life; for though willing to take the test, the Captain was\r\nhanged, by sentence of a quorum of the Council, in the Grassmarket, on\r\nthe 9th May. In August, 1853, a monument to his memory was erected in\r\nthe churchyard of Ayr.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by all that had passed and was still passing around him, in\r\nthe September of that year, Donald Cargill, one of the most determined\r\npreachers of the Covenant, and one who had long escaped the fangs of\r\nthe Council, held a conventicle in the Torwood, near Stirling, and\r\nwith all solemnity and bitterness excommunicated the King, the Dukes\r\nof York, Monmouth, and Lauderdale, General Dalyell and others, an\r\nact of daring which, at such a time, made a deep impression on the\r\nGovernment; but in the following year he paid for his enthusiasm\r\nby the forfeit of his life, being captured by General Dalyell, and\r\nexecuted by the authorities.\r\n\r\nTyranny and local misgovernment had now rendered the condition of poor\r\nScotland sad beyond description.\r\n\r\nThrough the lonely mosses, the pathless moors, and pastoral mountain\r\ndistricts of their native land, the unhappy Covenanters were hunted\r\nlike beasts of prey, without a refuge or a resting place but such\r\nas Heaven accords to wild animals; and wherever found, captivity or\r\ndeath was the penalty. During twenty-eight years of this military\r\npersecution, it has been calculated that eighteen thousand persons\r\nsuffered death in the field, or by the utmost extremities of torture\r\nthat the Council could inflict; seventeen hundred were banished to the\r\nplantations, and two hundred perished on the scaffold alone; seven\r\nthousand are said to have fled to foreign countries, and four hundred\r\nand ninety-eight were slain in cold blood, or in casual encounters; and\r\nall this was done in the name of God, of Religion, and Law!\r\n\r\nIn September, 1679, there was a stormy debate in the Scottish Privy\r\nCouncil. By an act of indemnity, his Majesty pardoned all who had been\r\nat Bothwell Bridge, ministers and lesser barons excepted, provided they\r\nappeared before such persons as the Council should appoint, and signed\r\na bond that never again would they rise in arms against the government.\r\nIt may readily be believed that very few gave this promise; and from\r\nthe minutes it would appear that Dalyell and Sir George Mackenzie of\r\nRosehaugh, urged that all who had _not_ done so should be proceeded\r\nagainst as rebels. The President and others pled that to proceed to\r\nfurther extremities would be cruel, as more than four thousand persons,\r\nmany of whom might be sick or ignorant of the King's letter, were\r\ninvolved in the measure proposed, and ultimately Dalyell, and those who\r\nadhered to him, agreed that the King should once more be addressed on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe next entry connected with the General runs thus:--\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1679. \"At Privy Council there is a letter read from his\r\nMajesty, nominating Lieutenant-General Dalziel commander-in-chief of\r\nall the forces of Scotland, with power to him _to act as he shall think\r\nfit_, and only be liable and accountable and judgeable by his Majesty\r\nhimself; for Dalziel would not accept of it otherways; only he promised\r\nand declared, that in difficult exigents he should take the advice of\r\nhis Majesty's Privy Council.\" (_Fountainhall_, vol. i.) On the 3rd\r\nJune, 1680, the Council received a letter from Charles on this subject.\r\nIt declared that when he gifted forfeitures, he always reserved for\r\nhis own use the houses standing on the forfeited lands. He also gave\r\nDalyell a Commission of Justiciary, with the advice of nine others, to\r\nexecute justice on all who were in arms at Bothwell, or failed to take\r\nthe bond within the period stated, since the 1st of January.\r\n\r\nIn 1680, the Duke of York and Albany arrived in Edinburgh, to supersede\r\nLauderdale, and took up his residence at Holyrood. Dalyell received\r\nhim at the head of the troops and a body of armed citizens, consisting\r\nof sixty men chosen from the sixteen companies of the Trained Bands\r\nwhich lined the streets. After his arrival, he and his Duchess, Marie\r\nd'Este of Modena, so celebrated for her beauty, left nothing undone\r\nto ingratiate themselves with the Scottish people, to the end that,\r\nif excluded by the Act of Succession from the English throne, they\r\nmight for themselves secure the ancient crown of Scotland. Everything\r\nwas studied, done, and adopted to ensure popularity; and one fact\r\nis certain, that after the Duke's arrival the persecution of the\r\nCovenanters was much less severe than before. By ostentatious pageants,\r\nhe revived in the nation what it was even then beginning to forget, the\r\nmemory of its regal independence and the pride of better days; and thus\r\nhe sought to make his family less abhorred in the hearts of the people.\r\nHe projected many improvements at Edinburgh. Among others, the plan for\r\nbuilding a bridge across the North Loch, and having a new town built\r\nupon the northern ridge; and the Holyrood parties, where _tea_ was seen\r\nfor the first time in Scotland, the balls and masques of the Ladies\r\nAnne, afterwards of Denmark, and Mary, afterwards of Orange, were long\r\nthe theme of aged demoiselles and stately dowagers in Edinburgh, where\r\nthe beauty and charming suavity of the young princesses, with their\r\nnatural gaiety, brightened the gloomy towers and tapestried rooms of\r\nthe ancient palace: and the memory of these things was transmitted by\r\nmany a mother and grandmother to their little ones, when the last of\r\nthat old royal race was far away in hopeless exile and obscurity, and\r\nthe first grass of spring was sprouting on the graves of Culloden.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York and his Duchess are said to have been warned of the\r\nlofty spirit and haughty punctilio of the old Scottish aristocracy from\r\na speech of General Dalyell.\r\n\r\nJames had invited this stern and bearded cavalier to dine with them at\r\nHolyrood soon after his arrival; but the Duchess Mary, as a daughter of\r\nthe ducal Prince of Modena, seemed to consider it somewhat derogatory\r\nto her rank to sit with a subject at table, and declined to take her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the old veteran, \"I have dined at a table where _your_\r\nfather must have stood at _my_ back.\"\r\n\r\nIn this instance it is supposed that he alluded to the board of the\r\nEmperor of Germany, whom the Duke of Modena, if summoned, must have\r\nattended as an officer of the household. Abashed by the firm retort of\r\nthis grim old man, the haughty princess at once took her seat, and from\r\nthenceforward she and her husband resolved, in their intercourse with\r\nthe Scottish noblesse, to exercise all the suavity and affability they\r\ncould command. By various acts of leniency the Duke also sought to win\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\"General Dalyell,\" says old Lord Fountainhall in his _Diary_, \"having\r\ncaused to be condemned by court martial a sentinel who had been found\r\nsleeping at one of the gates of the Abbey, the Duke caused him to be\r\nremitted and forgiven all punishment.\"\r\n\r\nIn this year, soon after the Duke's arrival, the services of the\r\nGeneral were required to repress a dangerous demonstration among the\r\nstudents of the Edinburgh University. Being deeply imbued with the\r\nsentiments of the Covenanters, on Christmas Day, 1680, these young men\r\nresolved to manifest publicly their horror of all prelacy, by burning\r\nan effigy of the Pope, a ceremony eminently calculated to offend\r\nthe royal Duke, as a zealous Catholic; and the magistrates, having\r\nresolved at all hazards to prevent this impolitic display, immediately\r\ncommunicated with General Dalyell, that he might have the troops in\r\nreadiness to overawe the city. In furtherance of their daring scheme,\r\nthe students posted on all the gates and public places of Edinburgh the\r\nfollowing curious placard:--\r\n\r\n \"AN ADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n \"These are to give notice to all noblemen, gentlemen, and citizens,\r\n that we, the students in the Royal College of Edinburgh (to show our\r\n detestation and abhorrence of the Romish religion, and our zeal and\r\n fervency for the Protestant), do resolve to burn the effigies of\r\n _Antichrist, the Pope of Rome_, at the Mercat-cross of Edinburgh, at\r\n twelve o'clock in the forenoon--being the festival of our Saviour's\r\n nativity. And since we hate tumults as we do superstition, we do\r\n hereby, under pain of death, discharge all plunderers, robbers,\r\n thieves, whores, and bawds to come within forty paces of our company,\r\n and such as shall be found disobedient to these our commands, _sibi\r\n caveant_.\r\n\r\n \"By our special command, Robert Brown, Secretary to all our Theatrical\r\n and Extra-Literal Divertisements.\"\r\n\r\nBy an oath, the students bound themselves to stand by each other, under\r\na penalty, and employed a carver in wood to make them an effigy of\r\nhis Holiness, \"with clothes, triple crown, keys, and other necessary\r\nhabiliments.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord Provost, Sir James Dick, reported their intentions to the\r\nDuke of York, and threatened that \"he would make it a bloody Christmas\r\nfor them;\" while Dalyell marched all the troops from Leith into the\r\nCanongate. The Grassmarket, an old quaint street lying to the south of\r\nthe Castle rock, was filled with troops, whose patrols scoured all the\r\nwynds and closes, as the narrow alleys of the ancient city are named.\r\nThe militia, or trained bands of Edinburgh, occupied the High-street;\r\nguards were placed on the College, which stood without the walls, and\r\nthose at the palace were doubled for additional security to the royal\r\nduke and his family.\r\n\r\nUndismayed by all these warlike preparations, the students, many of\r\nwhom were armed with swords and pistols in their belts, mustered in\r\nthe High School yard, and with loud shouts bore, shoulder high, an\r\neffigy of the Holy Father, clad in pontifical robes, with mitre and\r\nkeys, down the narrow wynd that led from the school to the wynd of the\r\nBlackfriars, from whence they boldly issued by an archway into the\r\nlower end of the High-street; and there, after reading an accusation\r\nand sentence, amid a general cry of _Pareat Papa!_ they set fire to\r\nthe effigy, which was hollow and filled with gunpowder. To these\r\nproceedings the city militia offered no opposition; but, according\r\nto the history of this affair, published in Paternoster-row in 1681,\r\n\"on the first report of what was doing, General Dalyell galloped in\r\nwith his dragoons through the Netherbow-porte, and was followed by the\r\ninfantry under the Earl of Mar.\"\r\n\r\nA scuffle ensued. The Earl of Linlithgow, a Catholic peer, with a few\r\nof his Foot Guards, dispersed the students sword in hand, and in making\r\na pass at one of them, fell, amid loud laughter, prostrate before the\r\nblazing figure, which was burned to the complete satisfaction of all\r\nconcerned therein. Many students were captured and threatened with\r\ntorture by the Council; but for his loyalty in this affair, the house\r\nof the Lord Provost, an old manor at Priestfield, near Duddingstone,\r\nwas one night set on fire by ignited powder-balls, and burned to the\r\nground. A proclamation was issued, banishing all students fifteen miles\r\nfrom the capital, and for closing the gates of the university; but\r\nthe circumstance of a gunpowder barrel, bearing the Edinburgh Castle\r\nmark, being found near Priestfield, caused a general suspicion that\r\nsome officers of the garrison had a hand in the affair. A reward of two\r\nhundred merks was offered for each of the leaders in these outrages;\r\nbut it was to the honour of the students that not one was betrayed by\r\nhis comrades.\r\n\r\nThe civil commotions were now of a nature so serious, that the local\r\ngovernment forced the magistrates of Edinburgh to _number_ the\r\ninhabitants of the city and its suburbs, and to make accurate lists\r\nof all men and women between the ages of sixteen and sixty, for the\r\ninformation of the Lords of Council. The name, rank, or profession of\r\npersons in lodgings or hostelries, and of all strangers in the city,\r\nwere to be delivered nightly by the bailies to the captain of the city\r\nguard, who, under a penalty of 100_l._ Scots, was to send it to the\r\ncommander-in-chief, or officer next in command.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November, 1681, Dalyell raised that celebrated\r\ndragoon regiment, so well known in military history as the Scots\r\nGreys, from the peculiar colour of their horses. They were a corps\r\nof horse-grenadiers, and were recruited almost exclusively among\r\nthe sons of the Cavalier gentry and their tenants.[37] The regiment\r\nis now numbered as the 2nd Cavalry of the Line. They wore the old\r\nheavy-skirted buff coat; and it is worthy of remark, that the _last\r\ntime_ such a garment was worn in the British service was by the colonel\r\nwho commanded them at Minden, seventy-four years after.\r\n\r\nCaptain Creichton mentions that, when he was lying in his lodgings\r\nat Edinburgh, suffering from sword wounds received at Airsmoss,\r\nDalyell was wont to visit him daily, as he went to the Duke's Court at\r\nHolyrood, and once \"did me the honour,\" he continues, \"to mention me\r\nand my services to His Royal Highness, who was desirous to see me. I\r\nwas admitted to kiss his hand, and ordered to sit down in consequence\r\nof my honourable wounds, which would not suffer me to stand without\r\ngreat pain.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Reverend John Blackadder, a pious and good man, who\r\nhad long continued preaching in solitary places, revisited his native\r\ncountry, after having been in Holland, and was captured by a party of\r\nsoldiers, and brought to Edinburgh, where Johnstone, the town major,\r\nat once conveyed him, under escort, to the house of Dalyell, in the\r\nCanongate. The account of their interview, and of the examination of\r\nBlackadder before the inexorable Lords of Council, are graphically\r\ndetailed in the memoirs of that unfortunate Covenanter.\r\n\r\nThe Major conducted him down that long and ancient street to where\r\nthe General lived, near the old palace porch, which has now been\r\ndemolished. The prisoner was accompanied by his son Thomas, who in\r\nafter years died a merchant in New England. It chanced that the dreaded\r\nDalyell, whose white vow-beard and lofty bald head impressed with fear\r\nand respect all on whom he bent his stern grey eye, opened the door as\r\nthey approached, being probably about to walk forth.\r\n\r\n\"I have brought you a prisoner,\" said Major Johnstone.\r\n\r\n\"Take him to the guard,\" replied Dalyell, briefly.\r\n\r\nOn this the poor minister, whose emotions on finding himself confronted\r\nby the scourge of the Covenanters must have been far from enviable,\r\nstepped up the stair, and said timidly--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, may I speak with you a little?\"\r\n\r\n\"You, sir, have spoken too much already,\" replied Dalyell, in anger,\r\nfor he never controlled his wrath at the sight of a Covenanter. \"I\r\nshould hang you with my own hands, over that outshot!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Dalyell knew not who Blackadder really was; but finding\r\nhim in a mood so sullen, and aware that the old man's anger was not to\r\nbe trifled with, the Major took his prisoner away. Instead, however,\r\nof consigning him to the common guard-house--for Blackadder was a man\r\nalike venerable by his years and character--he gave him a room in the\r\nhouse of Captain Murray, of Philiphaugh, where he remained until he was\r\nbrought to the dread Council chamber for examination before the Duke of\r\nRothes, then Lord High Chancellor of Scotland; Sir George Mackenzie,\r\nof Rosehaugh, King's Advocate; General Dalyell, and Paterson, the last\r\nBishop of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a minister?\" asked Rothes.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied Blackadder.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Troqueer, in Galloway.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since 1653.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you excommunicate the King at the Torwood, or were you there at\r\nthe time?\" continued the Chancellor.\r\n\r\n\"I have not been at the Torwood for these four years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you _think_ of it (the excommunication)? Do you _approve_\r\nof it?\"\r\n\r\nHe was asked the usual ensnaring questions (and, like other prisoners,\r\nhad the instruments of torture on the table before him) as to whether\r\nhe approved of the execution of Charles I.; if he had preached in the\r\nfields and on the hill-sides, and so forth; but his answers proved\r\nunsatisfactory, and, after a long examination, he was sent back to\r\nPhiliphaugh's apartments at Holyrood.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the next day he sent his son Thomas to a kinsman\r\nnamed Blackadder, who bore the rank of colonel, and had been Dalyell's\r\ncomrade in the expedition at Skelko Castle in 1654, and who now exerted\r\nhimself in his favour, and made such interest with the stern General,\r\nthat he received the recusant divine with great politeness in the\r\nforenoon, when he was again brought before the Council.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blackadder,\" said he, \"of what family are you--the House of\r\nTulliallan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, General, I am the nearest alive now, to represent that family,\r\nalthough it is now ruined and brought so low.\"\r\n\r\nDalyell was also allied by blood to the family of Tulliallan.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the son of Sir John Blackadder?\" asked Bishop Paterson; but\r\nthe inflexible Covenanter declined _his_ authority as a spiritual lord,\r\nand would not reply even to this trivial question.\r\n\r\nIn the sequel, he was sent prisoner to the Bass, escorted by three Life\r\nGuardsmen, and an officer named Rollock, who threatened to pistol him\r\nat Fisher-row, when the people gathered to see him pass. On that dreary\r\nrock, which was then the home of many a broken heart, the old man died\r\nin his seventieth year, and he now lies in the churchyard of North\r\nBerwick.[38]\r\n\r\nThe publication of a stern and high-toned manifesto against _Charles\r\nStuart_, and all supporters of his authority, together with the secret\r\nmurder of two gentlemen of the Life Guards, who had been particularly\r\nactive in discovering conventicles, and who were assassinated a few\r\nnights after its appearance in November, 1684, excited great alarm in\r\nthe minds of the Scottish ministry. An oath, abjuring the principles\r\ninculcated by this document, was ordained to be put to all persons\r\nabove sixteen years of age, and capital punishment was the penalty\r\nof all who refused it. Dalyell took measures still more decisive\r\nwith the parish where the guardsmen were murdered; and he marched a\r\nbody of troops to Livingstone, where the officers had authority to\r\nsummon before them the inhabitants of that parish, and of five others\r\nadjacent, that they might be interrogated upon the late seditious\r\nmanifesto.\r\n\r\nThose who owned it were instantly to be shot; and those who refused to\r\nanswer were also to be shot. Officers and soldiers were sent through\r\nEdinburgh--particularly to the Calton, where the poorest and most\r\nhumble class of citizens resided--to enforce the oath of abjuration\r\nand ask ensnaring questions, as to whether the rising at Bothwell was\r\na _rebellion_, and the slaying of Archbishop Sharpe a _murder_? \"Old\r\nwomen were taken from their wheels, and journeymen and apprentices from\r\nthe forge, to answer these teazing and captious questions,\" and the\r\nthumbikins were always at hand to freshen their memories.\r\n\r\nA document preserved in the General Register House at Edinburgh,\r\nsigned by Charles II. at Windsor, 16th of June, 1684, and printed by a\r\nliterary club, affords us a list of the Scottish standing forces, then\r\ncommanded by Dalyell, and irrespective of the militia which formed the\r\nmain strength of the country.\r\n\r\nReduced since Bothwell, the Life Guards then consisted of a hundred\r\nmen; each officer was furnished with two horses; the pay, sterling, of\r\na captain was 1_l._ per diem; of the lieutenants 12_s._; of the cornets\r\n7_s._; of the troopers 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's regiment of Foot Guards, still commanded by\r\nLieut.-General George, Earl of Linlithgow, consisted of ten companies,\r\neach consisting of three officers, two sergeants, two drummers, and\r\nseventy-three rank and file, making a total strength, staff included,\r\nof eight hundred and seven men.\r\n\r\nThe grenadiers of the Foot Guard were the same in number as the ten\r\npreceding companies.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Mar's regiment consisted of eleven companies of eighty\r\nstrong. The pay of a captain of infantry was 8_s._ sterling per diem;\r\nthe privates received 5_d._\r\n\r\nA regiment of horse (armed with sword and pistol), consisting of five\r\ntroops of fifty men each, including officers and men.\r\n\r\nA regiment of dragoons (armed with sword, pistol, and _musket_, for\r\nservice on horseback or on foot), the _Scots Greys_, consisting of \"six\r\ncompanies,\" also of fifty-nine each, including officers. All troopers\r\nreceived 1_s._ per diem.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Edinburgh Castle consisted of 5 officers and 121\r\nsoldiers; of Stirling Castle, 3 officers and 47 soldiers; of Dunbarton\r\nCastle, 3 officers and 32 soldiers; of the Bass Rock, 1 officer and 28\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe train of artillery was commanded by a Master of the Ordnance, whose\r\npay was 120_l._ per annum, with a conductor, engineer, fireworker, and\r\nmaster gunners.--(_Miscellany of the Maitland Club._)\r\n\r\nDalyell's pay as a Scottish General was 400_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nAssisted by a militia, this small force proved sufficient, for a time,\r\nto coerce all the Lowlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn July, this year, Mr. William Spence, a follower of the recently\r\nforfeited Marquis of Argyle, was tortured by the Privy Council, that\r\nhe might be forced to reveal all he knew of that noble's intrigues\r\nwith the English, and to read certain letters in cypher, which were\r\nplaced before him by Major Holmes; but on the torture failing to\r\nproduce the desired effect, \"he was,\" according to Lord Fountainhall,\r\n\"_put in General Dalyell's hands_; and it was reported that by a hair\r\nshirt and pricking (_i.e._, with a needle), as the witches are used,\r\nhe was five nights kept from sleep, till he was half distracted. He\r\nate very little that he might require less sleep; yet all this while\r\nhe discovered nothing; though had he done so, little credit was to be\r\ngiven to what he should say at such a time.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this is the following entry:--\r\n\r\n\"August 7th, 1684. At Privy Council, Spence (mentioned 26th July)\r\nis again tortured, and has his thumbs crushed with thumbiekins. It\r\nis a new invention used among the colliers when transgressors, and\r\ndiscovered by General Dalziell and Drummond, they having seen them used\r\nin Muscovy. After this, when they were about to put him in the boots,\r\nhe, being frightened, desired time, and he would declare what he knew;\r\nwhereon they gave him some time, and sequestrated him in the Castle of\r\nEdinburgh, as a place where he would be free from any bad advice or\r\nimpression to be obstinate in not revealing.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something alike quaint and horrible in the quiet and\r\nmatter-of-fact way in which this old senator records such\r\nextra-judicial barbarities; but instruments of torture were then as\r\nnecessary to the Privy Council as the pen and ink with which their\r\nminutes were recorded.\r\n\r\nTo repress the reviving spirit of the Covenanters, four Commissions\r\nof Lieutenancy were, in September, ordained to meet at Glasgow, Ayr,\r\nDumfries, and Dunse. The first, as Dalyell ordered, to be guarded by\r\nLord Ross's troop of Horse and Captain Inglis's Dragoons; the second\r\nby the troop of Guards and his own Grey Dragoons; the third by the\r\nHorse of Claverhouse, Drumlanrig, and Strachan; the fourth by the Horse\r\nof Balcarris and Lord Charles Murray's Dragoons; but now the horrors\r\nof this civil and military persecution received a check by the death\r\nof Charles II. on the 6th February 1685, and on the accession of his\r\nbrother, who was immediately proclaimed at Edinburgh, James VII. of\r\nScotland, by the Lyon King and magistrates, and Dalyell received a\r\nnew commission as commander-in-chief of the kingdom; but the Catholic\r\ntendencies of the new court--tendencies to which, with all his hatred\r\nof Covenanters and Low Churchmen, \"the old Muscovite\" was rigidly\r\naverse--would not have permitted him to retain his authority long.\r\n\r\nDeath now, however, solved the important problem of how he was to act\r\nat this peculiarly dangerous juncture; he was thus, to use the words of\r\nhis comrade Creichton, \"rescued from the difficulties he was likely to\r\nbe under, between the notions he had of duty to his prince on one side,\r\nand true zeal for his religion on the other;\" as he expired suddenly at\r\nhis house in the Canongate of Edinburgh, in the month of July, 1685.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th August, while the minute-guns boomed from the dark portholes\r\nof the ancient half-moon battery of the castle, his body, in a\r\nmagnificent hearse, drawn by plumed horses, and having six pieces\r\nof brass cannon, his led charger, his suit of armour, and his many\r\ntrophies, sword, spurs, helmet, and gauntlets, and his general's\r\nbâton, all borne by officers of rank, and escorted by all the standing\r\nforces in Edinburgh, with drums muffled, standards craped, and arms\r\nreversed, was slowly conveyed through the western gate of the city to\r\nLinlithgowshire, and interred in the family vault of the Dalyells at\r\nBinns, in the parish of Abercorn.\r\n\r\nThere the persecuting Cavalier rests in peace, though the superstitious\r\npeasantry still aver that his tall, thin, and venerable figure, in\r\nbuff coat and head-piece, with his vast white beard floating from his\r\ngrim visage to his military girdle, is seen \"in glimpses of the moon,\"\r\nflitting, like an unquiet spirit, about the old manor house, or in the\r\navenues and parks which were formed by himself around it.\r\n\r\nHe died in his eighty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of the Covenanters gathered hope, and held jubilee at his\r\ndeath; and if all be true that is recorded of him, it can scarcely be\r\na matter for wonder that his name and memory are still execrated in\r\nScotland, and that the reputation he has left behind him is not one to\r\nbe envied.\r\n\r\nGeneral Drummond, his old Russian comrade, succeeded him as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Scottish army; Charles, Earl of Dunmore, was\r\nappointed Colonel of the Scots Greys, and the Laird of Livingstone\r\nfilled the seat left vacant by him, as Commissioner in Parliament for\r\nthe shire of Linlithgow.\r\n\r\nHis son Thomas, who succeeded him, was created a baronet of Nova\r\nScotia, and left a daughter, Magdalene Dalyell, who, by her marriage\r\nwith James Menteith, of Auldcathie, transmitted the property to her\r\nson, who thus represented the ancient line of the Earls of Menteith.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the life of this singular officer, I cannot do better than\r\nquote the words of one of the most temperate and popular of Scottish\r\nwriters:--\r\n\r\n\"There are _two_ ways of contemplating the character even of so\r\nblood-stained a persecutor as Dalyell. He had, it must be remarked,\r\nserved royalty upon principle in its worst days, and seen a monarch\r\nbeheaded by a small party of his rebellious subjects, and a great part\r\nof the community, including himself, deprived of their property, and\r\nobliged to fly for their lives to foreign lands; and all this was on\r\naccount of _one particular way_ of viewing politics and religion. When\r\nthe usual authorities of the land regained their ascendancy, Dalyell\r\nmust naturally have been disposed to justify and support very severe\r\nmeasures, in order to prevent the _recurrence_ of such a period as the\r\nCivil War and the Usurpation. Thus all his cruelties are resolved into\r\nan abstract principle, to the relief of his personal character, which\r\notherwise, we do not doubt, might be very good. How often do we see,\r\neven in modern times, actions justified upon general views, which would\r\nbe shuddered at if they stood upon their naked merits, and were to be\r\nperformed upon the sole responsibility of the individual!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the chequered military career of the first colonel of the old\r\nScots Greys, certainly one of the most remarkable men of a time replete\r\nwith bloodshed and cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe persecuted and the persecutor--the fiery Cavalier and the stern\r\nCovenanter--are alike in their quiet graves, and the grass of nearly\r\ntwo hundred years has grown and withered over them. Their strife is\r\nbecoming, indeed, a tale of the times of old; yet few Scotsmen can look\r\nback without emotions of sorrow and compassion to those dark days of\r\nreligious madness and political misrule when, with all their bravery,\r\ntheir forefathers perpetrated such deeds as made \"the angels weep.\"\r\nBut, happily for us, time and the grave mellow the memory of all things.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Chambers' _Eminent Scotsmen_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Alexander Gordon, of Auchintoul, major-general in the\r\nservice of the czar, wrote a life of Peter I., which was published\r\nat Aberdeen in 1755. \"On the 30th November, this year,\" says this\r\nwork, \"died also General Patrick Gordon, much regretted by the czar\r\nand the whole nation. His majesty visited him five times during his\r\nillness--was present at the moment he expired, and shut his eyes\r\nwith his own hands. He was buried also in great state.
