FISHER UNWIN, 1896\r\n                         (For Great Britain).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew countries have been more strangely misunderstood by the average\r\nEnglishman than Bohemia has been. The mischievous blunder of some\r\nfifteenth century Frenchman, who confused the gipsies who had just\r\narrived in France with the nation which was just then startling Europe\r\nby its resistance to the forces of the Empire, has left a deeper mark\r\non the imagination of most of our countrymen than the martyrdom of\r\nHus or even the sufferings of our own Princess Elizabeth. The word\r\n“Bohemian” has passed into newspaper slang; and it has been so often\r\nquoted in its slang sense by people who ought to be more careful in\r\ntheir language, that it has really hindered the study of the real\r\ncountry which it misrepresents. The few who care to hear anything\r\nmore of a people so strangely slandered, have often been yet further\r\nblinded by their readiness to accept as absolute truth the prejudices\r\nof the German and Magyar opponents of the Bohemian national feeling.\r\nFrom these sources they have derived an impression of a set of narrow\r\nUltramontanes, who, oddly enough, combine their religious bigotries\r\nin favour of Roman Catholicism with a reliance on Russia in political\r\naffairs. These prejudices ought certainly to yield to an acquaintance\r\nwith the people in their own country. A Roman Catholicism, tempered\r\nby an enthusiasm for Hus and Z̆iz̆ka and King George, can scarcely be\r\na very obscurantist form of creed; and an intense feeling of national\r\ndistinctness can hardly be compatible with an anxiety to be absorbed\r\nby the great North-eastern Empire, though undoubtedly it produces\r\na stronger repulsion against the equally denationalising force of\r\nPan-Germanism. Perhaps a careful study of the history of a country\r\nso much misunderstood will be the best preparation for a fairer\r\nappreciation of its present difficulties.\r\n\r\nI have now to thank the many kind friends who have helped me in my\r\nwork. Of these the chief helper has been Professor Mourek. During\r\nthe whole of my stay at Prague I received every assistance from him\r\nwhich a foreigner studying in that town could possibly require; and\r\nsince I have returned to England he has helped me most energetically\r\nin procuring various illustrations necessary for my book. I have also\r\nto thank Count Leo Thun (the cousin of the late Governor of Bohemia)\r\nfor many useful hints and introductions. I should also thank Mr.\r\nCustos Borovsky, of the Rudolfinum, for the kindness with which he\r\nsupplied me with introductions during my visits to other towns in\r\nBohemia and Moravia. I should also thank Professor Rez̆ek for many\r\nuseful hints, especially about the difficult reign of Ferdinand I.\r\nProfessor Kalausek I have to thank for hints about the earlier period.\r\nProfessor Tomek I must thank for allowing me to use the map of Prague\r\nwhich appears in my book. I must also thank Dr. Toman for the use of\r\nthe curious pictures of Z̆iz̆ka. For help in my work in other towns I\r\nmust thank Father Wurm, of Olmütz (Olomouci); Mr. Palliardi, of Znaym\r\n(Znojem); Professor Brettholz, of Brünn (Brno); the Sub-librarian of\r\nC̆aslau; Professor Lemminger, of Kuttenberg (Kutna Hora); Mr. Gross,\r\nof Krumov; Father Fuc̆ik, of Prachatice; Professor Strnad, of Pilsen\r\n(Plz̆en); Monsignore Rodler, of Budweis (Budejóvice); the Keeper of the\r\nArchives at Wittingau (Tr̆ebon̆), and Professor Sedlac̆ek, of Tabor. I\r\nalso wish to thank Mr. C̆elakovsky, of the Town Archives of Prague, for\r\nthe suggestion about the relation of the early Utraquist rising to the\r\ndifferences between Bohemian workmen and German employers (see Chap.\r\nix. pp. 231, 232).\r\n\r\nThe question of when and how far to use the Bohemian names of places\r\nis one of some difficulty. My own instinct would be to use them\r\nwherever possible. But it cannot be denied that there are cases in\r\nwhich the German forms are so well known to English readers, and some\r\nin which the Bohemian names seem so unpronounceable, that it would be\r\naffectation to follow the strict rules of national expression. Praha,\r\nof course, has been hopelessly Anglicized into Prague; and Olomouci,\r\nCheb, Brno, and Plz̆en have been as certainly Germanised into Olmütz,\r\nEger, Brünn, and Pilsen. Even in these cases I have on some occasions\r\nadded the Bohemian names in brackets. But it was so difficult to know\r\nwhat names of Bohemian towns are generally known in England, that I\r\nmay sometimes seem to have been inconsistent in my practice. Only let\r\nme assure my readers that my wish has been to impress on them the\r\ndistinctive character of the Bohemian language, and at the same time to\r\nsecure the recognition of any places with whose names they are already\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                       PAGE\r\n    I.\r\n\r\n    FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF BOHEMIAN HISTORY TO THE HUNGARIAN\r\n    INVASION                                                           1-17\r\n\r\n    (-885.)\r\n\r\n    Characteristics of Bohemian history--Story of Queen\r\n    Libus̆a--Early Slavonic kingdom--The struggle with the\r\n    Franks--Resistance to Frankish “conversions”--Boris of\r\n    Bulgaria and Methodius--The Cyrillic language--Cyril\r\n    and Methodius in Moravia--Career of Svatopluk--Renewed\r\n    struggle with the Franks--Conversion of Bor̆ivoj--The\r\n    Slavonic ritual--Opposition of Svatopluk and his\r\n    courtiers to Methodius--The appeal to the Pope--The\r\n    “Pilatici”--Approval of the ritual by John VIII.--Wiching’s\r\n    fraud--Svatopluk and Arnulf--Expulsion of the\r\n    Methodian Christians from Moravia--Death of Svatopluk--Mojmir\r\n    and the Slavonic ritual--The Hungarian invasion.\r\n\r\n    II.\r\n\r\n    BOHEMIAN SAINTS AND WARRIORS IN THE TENTH CENTURY                 18-32\r\n\r\n    (885-997.)\r\n\r\n    Bohemian feeling about the saintly and the military\r\n    character--Svatopluk’s struggle and fall--Separation of\r\n    Bohemia from Moravia--Reigns of Bor̆ivoj and Vratislav--The\r\n    heathen reaction under Drahomíra--Life, death, and\r\n    character of St. Wenceslaus--Reign of Boleslav the Cruel--Rise\r\n    of the Vrs̆ovici--Boleslav the Pious--Life and death\r\n    of St. Adalbert.\r\n\r\n    III.\r\n\r\n    RELATIONS OF BOHEMIA TO POLAND AND TO THE EMPIRE IN THE\r\n    ELEVENTH, TWELFTH, AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES                       33-66\r\n\r\n    (997-1253.)\r\n\r\n    Effect of the Hungarian invasions on the position of\r\n    Bohemia--The struggles between Bohemia and Poland--Romantic\r\n    stories of Oldr̆ich and Brac̆islav--Revival of\r\n    the Slavonic ritual--Brac̆islav’s victories in Poland--The\r\n    scene in the Church at Gnesen--Invasion of Bohemia by\r\n    Henry III.--The Pr̆emyslovci made hereditary Dukes--Spitihnĕv’s\r\n    anti-German policy--Election and policy of\r\n    Vratislav--The family opposition and its results--Relations\r\n    with Henry IV.--The first Bohemian king--Relations with\r\n    the Hohenstauffen--Vladislav’s policy and the opposition\r\n    of the nobles--Frederick Barbarossa--The second King of\r\n    Bohemia--Bohemians in Italy--Summary of Vladislav’s\r\n    reign--New disorders--Election of Pr̆emysl--Divisions in\r\n    the Empire and their effect on the Bohemian position--Contests\r\n    of King and Priest--Breach between Bohemia\r\n    and the Empire--Conquest of Austria by Bohemia--Accession\r\n    of Ottakar II.\r\n\r\n    IV.\r\n\r\n    THE GROWTH OF BOHEMIAN LIFE FROM ACCESSION OF PR̆EMYSL OTTAKAR\r\n    I.

FISHER UNWIN, PATERNOSTER SQUARE, LONDON, E.C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF BOHEMIAN HISTORY TO THE HUNGARIAN INVASION.\r\n\r\n(-885.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of a lost nationality is necessarily tragic and can rarely\r\nbe commonplace. In the case of Bohemia the interest is increased by\r\nthe variety of the parts which she was forced to play, each of which,\r\nwhile of great value to the world, assisted in some degree to hasten\r\nher ruin. Thus, for instance, the intense desire to maintain her own\r\nindependent life brought her into collision with neighbouring States\r\nwhich were determined to crush or to absorb her; while, on the other\r\nhand, her position as the champion of a race, of which she was but one\r\nmember, dragged her into further quarrels that were not necessarily\r\nthe result of her geographical position. And, lastly, the very desire\r\nto maintain her national existence, and to defend the freedom of her\r\nSlavonic kinsmen, constantly compelled her to mix in the quarrels of\r\nthat larger world with which she and they had so little sympathy; and\r\neven to accept a share in the responsibilities of that Empire, which,\r\ncalling itself Roman, was always becoming more and more Teutonic, and\r\ntherefore more anti-Slavonic.\r\n\r\nAnd in that struggle between Teuton and Slav the one thing which, from\r\nthe earliest to the latest times, has been the most prized treasure,\r\nand the subject of the fiercest championship of the Bohemian, is his\r\nlanguage. Every effort for constitutional government and national\r\nliberty has always directly connected itself with this aspiration for\r\nthe preservation, development, and general recognition of this great\r\nright. Sigismund, in the time of his most cruel attempts to crush\r\nout the freedom of his subjects, was denounced as “the enemy of our\r\nlanguage,” rather than of our nation. Hus is honoured, even by Roman\r\nCatholic Bohemians, as the assertor and developer of their language.\r\nIt was the great crime of Joseph II. that he desired to destroy it.\r\nIf we could have talked with a Bohemian Christian of the ninth or\r\ntenth century, we should have found his deepest feelings stirred by a\r\nreference to the language which was then assuming its first shape; and\r\nthe same subject has the deepest interest for the Bohemian patriot of\r\nthe nineteenth century, now that his language has become one of the\r\nmost varied and expressive of modern Europe.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the connection of the ecclesiastical independence\r\nof Bohemia with her most vivid political life. From the time when the\r\nmission of Cyril and Methodius brought to the front the question of a\r\nSlavonic ritual, and of an ecclesiastical organisation, which was to\r\nbe separated as far as possible from Teutonic influences, to the time\r\nwhen Bohemia sank before Ferdinand in the struggle between national\r\nProtestantism and Imperial Romanism, the questions of Bohemian language\r\nand Bohemian self-government were mixed up continually with the claim\r\nto be guided in spiritual things by a clergy who preached and prayed in\r\nthe Slavonic language.\r\n\r\nEven the earliest traditions show that long before the introduction\r\nof Christianity the Bohemian ideal of national life had been totally\r\ndifferent from that of the surrounding nations. The poem of “The\r\nJudgment of Libus̆a,” which seems to embody the earliest picture of\r\nBohemian life, is no Iliad or Niebelungen Lied, no story of robber\r\ndens or rapes of the Sabines, but the representation of a peace-loving\r\nnation trying to uphold traditions of communal ownership of land, and\r\nthe gentle guidance of the wisest in judicial affairs, modified by an\r\norganised expression of popular opinion.[1]\r\n\r\nSo great an impression did the poems, in which this ideal is set forth,\r\nproduce on the Bohemian mind, that extracts from them are translated at\r\nfull length by the chronicler Cosmas, who took an active part in the\r\nbustling politics of the eleventh century, when these ideals must have\r\nseemed to belong to a very distant past.\r\n\r\nAccording to this writer, certain people who had been scattered by\r\nthe failure of the Tower of Babel, wandered into Germany where they\r\nfound various wild beasts. One party in the course of their wanderings\r\nfound a plain lying near the mountain Rip, and between the rivers Ogra\r\n(Eger), and Wlitawa (Moldau). This plain they called Bohemia after the\r\neldest of the party named Boemus. Here they founded a peaceable and\r\ncommunistic settlement where they desired to make war on none but the\r\nbeasts. But, some ambitious men having introduced the evil of private\r\nproperty, it became necessary to choose a judge to decide the disputes\r\nwhich now unavoidably arose. So they chose as their judge their best\r\nman named Crocco, who founded a camp. He had three daughters, of whom\r\nthe eldest was skilled in medicine, the second was a kind of religious\r\nteacher, who instructed the people in the worship of Oreads and Dryads;\r\nwhile the third, Libus̆a, was distinguished for her political wisdom\r\nand foresight, and was supposed to be an inspired prophetess.\r\n\r\nLibus̆a was accordingly chosen to the judicial office on her father’s\r\ndeath. But Crocco’s formation of a camp seems to have stirred the\r\nmilitary spirit in the Bohemians; and the story which follows clearly\r\nindicates the transition from the earlier and more peaceable stage to\r\nthe later developments of national organisation. Two powerful chiefs\r\nare disputing for the land, which has come to them from their father.\r\nThe question is submitted to Libus̆a, as the chief judge. On the day of\r\nthe trial she appears in great state, summons before her the heads of\r\nthe different families or tribes, and submits to them her proposals for\r\nsettling this question. She declares that, according to the old custom\r\nof their people, the land ought either to be equally divided between\r\nthe brothers, or else they ought to share it in common. The leaders of\r\nthe tribes, after collecting in some way the votes of the assembly,\r\ndecide that the land is to be held in common, basing their judgment\r\nalso on the old traditions of the nation. Thereupon the elder of the\r\ndisputants rises in anger, and declares that he ought to have retained\r\nthe land in right of primogeniture, and further that the Bohemians\r\nought not to submit any longer to women, who were fitter for receiving\r\nthe advances of wooers than of dictating laws to soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen follows a scene which seems at once to fix the point of change\r\narrived at, and to make the circumstances more familiar for ordinary\r\nreaders by the parallel which it suggests with a familiar transition to\r\nmilitary kingship recorded in the Second Book of Samuel.\r\n\r\nLibus̆a, anxious to warn her people of the full effect of the course\r\nthey are taking, sets forth to them the dangers of a military monarchy.\r\nBeginning with a reference to the story of the petition of the frogs\r\nto Jupiter, she reminds them that it will be more easy to choose a\r\nchief than to remove him. “Before him your knees will tremble, and your\r\ntongue cleave to your mouth. You will with difficulty answer, ‘Yes,\r\nsir! yes, sir!’ He will condemn men by his nod without your judgment\r\nbeing taken; he will cut off the head of one, and throw others into\r\nprison; some of you he will make slaves, and others exactors and\r\ntorturers; others, again, he will make cooks or bakers or millers. He\r\nwill appoint you as tribunes or centurions or cultivators of his vines\r\nand wheat, as armourers and preparers of skins. He will reduce your\r\nsons and daughters to subjection, and will carry off the best of your\r\nhorses and mares and cattle to his palace. He will take what is best\r\nfrom your fields and plains and meadows and vineyards, and turn them to\r\nhis own use.” But though the criminal folly of the change proposed is\r\nindicated as clearly by Libus̆a as by Samuel, yet in both stories we\r\nfind by a strange contradiction the same half-mystical enthusiasm for\r\nthe person of the first king.\r\n\r\nLibus̆a, unable to resist the popular demand that she should take a\r\nhusband and give the Bohemians a king, tells the people to go to a\r\ncertain village where they will find a man ploughing with oxen. Him\r\nthey are to greet as their king, and his posterity will rule in this\r\nland for ever. The messengers plead that they do not know the way to\r\nthe village. Libus̆a answers that if they will follow her horse it\r\nwill guide them. They obey; and they at last arrive at the village\r\nof Stadic, where they find Pr̆emysl ploughing. They call on him to\r\nchange his dress and mount the horse, as Queen Libus̆a and all the\r\npeople demand him as their ruler. Pr̆emysl therefore sets free his\r\noxen, telling them to go whence they came, and strikes his goad into\r\nthe ground. The oxen vanish from sight, and the goad puts forth leaves\r\nand fruits. Then Pr̆emysl comes with the messengers; but he insists on\r\ntaking with him his ploughman’s boots, that his successors may be made\r\nhumble and merciful by the memory of the state from whence they sprung;\r\n“and these boots,” says Cosmas (writing in the eleventh century), “are\r\npreserved at Vys̆ehrad to this day in the Duke’s chamber.”\r\n\r\nThere is another legend which still more quaintly marks this transition\r\nfrom mild and readily accepted rule to the era of physical force.\r\nAccording to this story the maidens of Bohemia founded a city which\r\nthey called Dĕvín from Devina, “a maiden.” The young men to maintain\r\ntheir independence set up an opposition town called Hrasten. The\r\nintercourse between these rival towns seems to have been sometimes\r\nfriendly and sometimes hostile; but always apparently on equal terms as\r\nlong as Libus̆a lived. After her death, however, the men won the day,\r\nand ever afterwards held the women under their control.\r\n\r\nBut the golden age of Queen Libus̆a is long past, when we catch sight\r\nof the Bohemians in even the earliest period of authentic history.\r\nFirst we have a dim vision of a great Slavonic Empire stretching\r\nnorthwards to the Spree, and eastwards to the Carpathians; of struggles\r\nwith Avars and Huns, and, above all, with the Franks. Then suddenly,\r\nas the dim mist clears a little, we find that the Franks have become\r\nChristian, and the great struggle between German and Slav, hinted at\r\nalready in the poem of “Libus̆a’s Judgment,” has begun in earnest. The\r\ncentre of resistance to the German, however, is not in Bohemia, but in\r\nthe neighbouring Slavonic dukedom of Moravia; and it gathers round a\r\nprince named Rostislav, who is encouraging both Moravians and Bohemians\r\nto stand firm against those peculiar ideas of Christianity, which\r\nCharles the Great and his descendants tried to thrust upon reluctant\r\nnations by fire and sword. Some Bohemians had indeed been compelled\r\nby Louis, the grandson of Charles the Great, to accept baptism; and\r\nChristian Bohemia owned the authority of the German Archbishop of\r\nRegensburg.[2]\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of Bohemia, encouraged by Rostislav, still held out\r\nagainst the Carlovingian form of Christianity; the Moravians defeated\r\nLouis in 849, and Rostislav strengthened his own position as the\r\nchampion of Slavonic independence by an alliance with the Bulgarians.\r\nThis alliance was to produce results very unexpected at the time by\r\nRostislav, and powerfully affecting the future of Moravia and Bohemia.\r\nBoris, the powerful king of Bulgaria, had received at his Court a\r\nChristian monk named Methodius, the son of a patrician of Thessalonica.\r\nApparently Methodius had originally been brought to the Bulgarian Court\r\non account of his artistic talent; but he was also a very zealous\r\nChristian; and when Boris ordered him to paint such a picture, in\r\nthe hall of his palace, as would strike terror into all who saw it,\r\nMethodius improved the occasion by painting a picture of the Last\r\nJudgment. The inquiries and explanations that followed prepared the way\r\nfor the acceptance of the new faith by the king of Bulgaria and his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIBUS̆A’S BATH JUST BELOW THE VYS̆EHRAD.]\r\n\r\nBut the Greek missionaries found that the want of a written language\r\nprevented them from giving their Slavonic converts full instruction in\r\nthe details of the Christian creed. Methodius, therefore, called in the\r\nhelp of his brother Cyril, who had been occupied in the conversion of\r\nthe Chazars, a people whose country lay a little to the north of the\r\nBulgarian kingdom.\r\n\r\nCyril was a learned monk, who had been trained at the Court of\r\nConstantinople, and was well skilled in various languages. Taking\r\nthe Greek alphabet as his basis, but altering its form, he invented\r\na written language for the Slavonic race, into which he translated a\r\nliturgy, several books of the Bible, and some of the early Fathers.\r\n\r\nThe news of the conversion of the Bulgarians quickly came to the ears\r\nof Rostislav, for the great Bulgarian kingdom touched the eastern\r\nside of Moravia; and the recent alliance had brought the two peoples\r\ninto closer intercourse. Unwelcome as Christianity had seemed to the\r\nMoravians, when presented to them as a demand of Frankish invaders, and\r\ntaught in an unknown tongue, its lessons came with a very different\r\nforce when urged by pious and peaceable monks, recommended by friendly\r\nkinsmen, and expounded in a language intelligible to the converts.\r\nRostislav no doubt quickly perceived that the new teaching might form\r\na valuable link in the alliance of the Slavs against their enemies.\r\nHe appealed to the Emperor of the East to send Cyril and Methodius to\r\nMoravia; and, when they arrived at the town of Devina, Rostislav and\r\nhis followers went out to welcome them; and after Cyril had retired\r\nfrom the mission, Methodius was recognised by the Pope as Archbishop of\r\nMoravia and Pannonia.\r\n\r\nBut troubles very soon began for the new-comers. The German party in\r\nMoravia were resentful at the introduction into the churches of what\r\nthey considered a barbarous language; and they saw danger to their\r\npower, both in the adoption of a ritual which was understood by the\r\npeople, and in the assertion of an episcopal authority which claimed\r\nto be independent of the German bishops. Nor was it only by foreigners\r\nthat the influence of Cyril and Methodius was endangered; an opposition\r\nwas roused even among the Moravians themselves. Svatopluk, the nephew\r\nand rival of Rostislav, seems to have accepted some kind of nominal\r\nChristianity, but unaccompanied by any change of life, or even by any\r\ngreat reverence for the externals of worship; and he opposed the new\r\napostles of the Slavs with the greatest fierceness. The opposition\r\nof this ambitious prince no doubt arose at first from his desire to\r\npose as the champion of the German party, who were undermining his\r\nuncle’s authority. According to one story he had already attempted to\r\npoison Rostislav, and having failed in that purpose he conspired with\r\nthe Emperor Louis against him, made him prisoner, and sent him off to\r\nthe Imperial Court to be tried. Louis threw Rostislav into prison,\r\nand put out his eyes. But Svatopluk, though he succeeded in seizing\r\nthe Dukedom, did not long retain the confidence of the Emperor or the\r\nGerman party. He, in his turn, was deposed and thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nThen the Moravians rose against the Franks, under a man named Slavomir,\r\nwho, according to one story, was a pupil of Methodius. The Emperor\r\nthereupon set Svatopluk free, and sent him at the head of an army\r\nto suppress the new rising. Svatopluk betrayed his soldiers to his\r\ncountrymen, destroyed the German army, and once more became Duke of\r\nMoravia. He now felt it impossible any longer to pose as the champion\r\nof the German party; and he had married the sister of Duke Bor̆ivoj,\r\nof Bohemia, in order to strengthen the alliance of the Slavs against\r\nthe Franks. As a part of his new policy, he was forced, for a time, to\r\nencourage the movement of Methodius; and it was during this period that\r\nthe archbishop or one of his followers converted and baptised Bor̆ivoj,\r\nand induced him to found two churches in memory of St. Clement of Rome,\r\nwhose remains Cyril had discovered in his expedition to the Chazars.\r\n\r\nThere seems some difficulty in ascertaining how far the Slavonic\r\nritual came into general use in Bohemia at this time. It is tolerably\r\ncertain, on the one hand, that Methodius did not desire to oppose the\r\nauthority of the Bishop of Regensburg, who claimed to be primate over\r\nthe Bohemian Christians; and that bishop, like all the German prelates,\r\nwas opposed to the spread of the Slavonic ritual. On the other hand,\r\nit is clear that, as Christianity grew in Bohemia, it connected itself\r\nwith Slavonic traditions; and we find that in less than a century from\r\nthis time the Bohemian congregations had adopted a Slavonic hymn as a\r\nnecessary part of their ritual.\r\n\r\nBut, however slow the progress of Slavonic Christianity may have been\r\nin Bohemia, Methodius does not seem to have excited there that savage\r\nhostility which he continued to provoke in Moravia. Svatopluk and his\r\ncourtiers were, no doubt, indignant at the higher morality preached by\r\nMethodius; and one of the claimants of the German Empire, with whom\r\nSvatopluk was alternately in alliance and enmity, resented extremely\r\nthe authority claimed by Methodius over Pannonia as well as Moravia.\r\nBut, in order to strengthen their position, the opponents of Methodius\r\ntook advantage of his having come from Constantinople, to attack him as\r\na rebel against the Pope, and a supporter of the Greek heresy of the\r\nSingle Procession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRIL AND METHODIUS, FROM THE WINDOW OF A CHURCH IN\r\nCAROLINEN-THAL.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these charges was singularly inconsistent with the\r\ntraditions of both the brothers, who led the mission to the Slavs.\r\nCyril had been partially induced to go on his mission to the Chazars\r\nby the unfriendly relations which had arisen between him and the\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople. While in the Chersonesus he had discovered\r\nthe bones of the Roman saint, Clement, who had died there; and he had\r\never since recognised this saint as the special patron of his mission\r\nto the Slavs. After Cyril and Methodius had established themselves in\r\nMoravia, they had applied to Rome for sanction to their work; and when\r\nthey had been summoned to the Court of the Pope, in consequence of this\r\napplication, Cyril had been so much attracted to the place that he\r\nhad entered a Roman monastery, and had abandoned the mission, for the\r\nfuture, to Methodius. Methodius, on his part, seems to have been little\r\ninclined to resist authority, where no moral or religious principle\r\nwas concerned. So in 879 he readily accepted the summons to appear\r\nbefore the Roman Synod, and easily convinced Pope John VIII. of his\r\nwillingness to obey him. Methodius was equally happy in vindicating his\r\northodoxy in the matter of the Double Procession.\r\n\r\nBut when these points had been settled, there still remained the real\r\nsubjects of dispute. These were the lawfulness of the Slavonic ritual,\r\nand the position of Methodius as Archbishop of Moravia. Svatopluk had\r\nthrown himself with eagerness into the cause of Methodius’s opponents,\r\nand joined in the denunciation of the Slavonic ritual, declaring that\r\nit degraded worship by connecting it with a barbarous dialect. The\r\nchampions of the Latin ritual attempted to strengthen their cause\r\nby referring to the inscription written by Pilate on the Cross in\r\nHebrew and Greek and Latin. This argument brought them the nickname of\r\nPilatici, or followers of Pilate, while Methodius and his disciples\r\nappealed, in answer, to the authority of the Apostles, who, on the\r\nDay of Pentecost, had uttered in all languages the wonderful works of\r\nGod. Pope John seems clearly to have understood that the opposition to\r\nMethodius arose rather from prejudice of race than from ecclesiastical\r\nprinciple; and he recognised this fact in the Bull which sanctioned the\r\nSlavonic ritual. For in this document he expressly required that all\r\nthe clergy in the diocese of Moravia and Pannonia, whether Slav _or of\r\nwhatever race they might be_, should be submissive to the archbishop.\r\nA very noteworthy modification was subjoined to this decision which\r\nseemed to stamp a popular and democratic character on the Slavonic\r\nmovement. “If Svatopluk,” said the Pope, “and the members of his Court\r\ndesire to use the Latin ritual, they may do so still.”\r\n\r\nAn even more crushing blow to the hopes of the enemies of Methodius was\r\ngiven in a second decision of the Pope. The German party had persuaded\r\nSvatopluk to appoint a preacher named Wiching as Bishop of Nitra in\r\nPannonia, thereby hoping at any rate to counterbalance the authority\r\nof Methodius. Pope John, however, decided that he would only recognise\r\nthis appointment on condition that Wiching acknowledged the archbishop\r\nas his superior; and he expressly recommended Svatopluk to choose\r\nhis next bishop with the advice and consent of Methodius. So alarmed\r\nwere Wiching and his friends at this letter from the Pope that they\r\nsucceeded in suppressing it, before it could reach Svatopluk; and they\r\nforged another in which the Pope was made to say that Methodius had\r\nindeed recanted his heresy about the Double Procession; but that he\r\nwas forbidden to use the Slavonic ritual, and that Bishop Wiching was\r\nappointed to carry out the papal decrees.\r\n\r\nMethodius denied the genuineness of the document, and wrote to Rome for\r\nanother letter. John confirmed his former decree, and summoned Wiching\r\nto Rome to answer for his proceedings. Wiching, however, refused to go;\r\nand he was backed in his opposition both by Svatopluk and by Arnulf,\r\nthe claimant of the Empire, whose hold over Pannonia had been one\r\nof the chief causes of the opposition to the episcopal authority of\r\nMethodius.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Methodius and Svatopluk, always hostile, would\r\nnow have probably culminated in the death or exile of the archbishop,\r\nbut that a quarrel broke out between Svatopluk and Arnulf; and the\r\ndesire of Svatopluk to overthrow Arnulf’s influence in Pannonia\r\nnaturally hindered his action against Methodius. For the few remaining\r\nyears of the archbishop’s life, he was able to carry on his work,\r\nboth moral and religious, with much less opposition; but when, after\r\nhis death, his friends attempted to get his pupil Gorazd appointed\r\nas successor in the archbishopric, Wiching succeeded in stirring up\r\nSvatopluk against him, in renewing the alliance with Arnulf, and\r\nfinally in securing the expulsion from Moravia of the leading followers\r\nof Methodius. But in spite of the opposition of dukes and Germans, the\r\nSlavonic ritual held its own in Moravia, and Svatopluk’s son Mojmir\r\nbecame its champion against the bishops of Salzburg.\r\n\r\nImportant, however, as the defence of the Slavonic language and\r\nritual was in the history of Bohemia and Moravia, the enemy against\r\nwhom it had specially served as a watchword had ceased to become the\r\nobject of uncompromising hostility. A new power had made its way into\r\nEurope, more dangerous, for the moment, to Slavonic unity and Bohemian\r\nindependence than Frank, Saxon, or Bavarian; and the Bohemians and\r\nMoravians were for a time compelled to forget their fears and hatred of\r\nthe Germans, in order to combine with them against a new enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBOHEMIAN SAINTS AND WARRIORS IN THE TENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n(885-997.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ideal of life and character hinted at in the Libus̆in Saud affects,\r\nin an often contradictory way, the popular judgments of the prominent\r\ncharacters of Bohemian history. So strangely does this tendency\r\nmanifest itself at more than one stage of the story, that it would\r\nalmost seem as if the ordinary conceptions of national greatness, and\r\nsometimes even of independence, were entirely obscured by the Christian\r\naspiration after a peaceable national life. Kings and warriors,\r\nwho had done much to extend the prestige and power of Bohemia, are\r\nremembered mainly for their cruelty and oppression; while saints, who\r\nmay in some degree have weakened the sense of Bohemian independence,\r\nare not merely honoured, but are even put forward as the symbols of\r\ndistinctive national life. Thus, for instance, Svatopluk, the cruel\r\nand unscrupulous persecutor of Methodius and his followers, might,\r\nfrom the ordinary nationalist point of view, have been looked upon\r\nas the establisher of Slavonic greatness, the champion of Moravian\r\nindependence, and even the protector of Bohemia and Moravia against a\r\ncruel and barbarous invader.\r\n\r\nUnder his rule Moravia had become the centre of a great Slavonic\r\nalliance extending eastwards to Bulgaria and northwards to Magdeburg.\r\nThe exact relations between the dukedom of Moravia and the other States\r\nreferred to may be difficult to define; but the whole story of his\r\nrelations with Bohemia shows that Svatopluk exercised an authority\r\nthere which was, at least, equal to that maintained by the German\r\nEmperor over many of the states subject to him; and we may fairly\r\nassume that he held a somewhat similar position towards the other\r\nSlavonic States which surrounded him.\r\n\r\nSuch a position, in the then condition of Europe, could not but excite\r\nrivalry and jealousy among the neighbouring princes; and Arnulf, the\r\nDuke of Pannonia, who had aspired to the throne of the Frankish Empire,\r\nwas particularly jealous of a man whose power, as he considered,\r\nhad been largely due to the patronage which Arnulf had granted to\r\nhim. The exact merits of the numerous quarrels between these princes\r\nit is impossible to estimate accurately; but it is clear that, as\r\nSvatopluk gained power, he became more and more resolved to throw off\r\nthe authority which Arnulf found difficult to assert. At last Arnulf,\r\nhaving lost hope of maintaining his authority by his own force, and\r\nperhaps suspecting that Pannonia would itself fall a prey to his rival,\r\nresolved to call in a new ally to his assistance.\r\n\r\nThe emperors of Constantinople had followed the tradition of the\r\nWestern Empire, by playing off their barbarian invaders against one\r\nanother. And, as the Romans had used their alliance with the Goths to\r\ndrive back the hordes of Attila, so the Emperor of Constantinople had\r\ncalled on the descendants of Attila’s followers to protect the decaying\r\nempire from the inroads of the Bulgarians.\r\n\r\nIt was apparently in the latter part of the sixth century that the\r\nHungarians, or, as some called them, the Turks, had been driven into\r\nEurope by the pressure of other Asiatic races. They had been hospitably\r\nreceived at Constantinople, and, after various fortunes, had settled,\r\nin the eighth century, among the Chazars. But they were never allowed\r\nto remain long in one place; and it was in consequence of their\r\nalliance with the Emperors of the East that they overran Transylvania,\r\nand secured their first settlement in their future kingdom. Even here,\r\nhowever, they were not allowed to remain quietly, and another tribe\r\nsucceeded in driving them out of Transylvania for a time.\r\n\r\nIt was while this contest was at its height that the new invaders\r\nattracted the attention of Arnulf; and, in the year 892, finding\r\nhimself in a desperate plight, he persuaded the Hungarians to join\r\nhim in an invasion of Moravia. Svatopluk fought gallantly against his\r\nenemies, and more than once repelled them from his dukedom; but, in\r\n894, he was finally defeated by the combined forces of his opponents.\r\nThen comes in a story which illustrates in a startling manner the\r\nBohemian feeling that no military successes could atone for acts of\r\ncruelty and treachery. Although Svatopluk was undoubtedly fighting\r\nfor the independence of his country, he was seized, according to this\r\nlegend, with so extreme a fit of penitence for his crimes, that he fled\r\nfrom the battle to a secret place in the mountains, where he killed his\r\nhorse, buried his sword in the ground, and lived and died a hermit.\r\nWhat gives a still stranger flavour to the legend is the cause which\r\nCosmas assigns for the Duke’s penitence; for this cause was not his\r\npersecution of Methodius, but his ingratitude to Arnulf.\r\n\r\nThe ruin of the Moravian dukedom speedily followed. According to one\r\ntradition, Wiching, Svatopluk’s German bishop, was used by Arnulf\r\nto stir up division between the sons of Svatopluk. If so, he must\r\nundoubtedly have used his influence in favour of the younger Svatopluk,\r\nand against Mojmir, the champion of the Slavonic ritual. But, whatever\r\nthe cause of division, the fact of the civil war is undoubted; and all\r\nthe enemies of the country took advantage of it. In 896 the Hungarians\r\nagain invaded Moravia, and this time with much greater success. The\r\nstruggle was, however, continued for a few years longer, during which\r\nthe Emperor endeavoured to assist Mojmir; but at last, in 907, Mojmir\r\nwas killed in battle, and the old dukedom of Moravia was completely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF ST. LUDMILA.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the overthrow of this powerful State broke down, for a time,\r\na barrier between the savage invaders and the settled governments of\r\nEurope, it seems, strangely enough, to have produced less immediate\r\nevil to Bohemia than to the German principalities. It is, however, easy\r\nto understand that the protection and championship of a neighbouring\r\nState by such a ruler as Svatopluk may have had its disadvantages, both\r\nin checking the independence of the country protected, and in involving\r\nit in wars in which it had little interest. Indeed, it appears as if\r\nBor̆ivoj and his immediate successors were too much concerned with the\r\ninternal struggles of their country, to take much immediate interest\r\nin the apparently larger issues which were being settled in the\r\nneighbouring States. The Bohemian struggles were mainly concerned with\r\nthe rivalry between heathens and Christians. The zeal of Bor̆ivoj for\r\nthe new faith soon irritated a large number of his subjects against\r\nhim; and, being unwilling to maintain his authority by force of arms,\r\nhe abdicated in favour of his son Spitihnĕv. In the latter we seem\r\nto catch a glimpse of a premature champion of toleration, who, while\r\ndesiring to encourage the progress of Christianity, resented the\r\nexcessive influence of the Christian priests, and declared that he was\r\nequally the king of his heathen and Christian subjects alike. This,\r\nhowever, was a position that it was obviously impossible to maintain\r\nat such a transitional period; and, after Spitihnĕv’s death, Bor̆ivoj,\r\nbeing recalled to the throne, resolved that the propagation of his\r\ncreed should not again suffer by the laxity of his family. He therefore\r\nput his second son, Vratislav, under the special care of Methodius;\r\nand, after Bor̆ivoj and Methodius were both dead, Vratislav’s mother,\r\nLudmila, continued to influence him in favour of the new faith. But the\r\npower of Ludmila was counteracted, especially among the nobles, by\r\nher daughter-in-law Drahomíra, who became the centre of the heathen\r\nopposition to Ludmila and the clergy; and she trained her son Boleslav\r\nto follow in her footsteps. Vratislav’s other son, Václav (or, as we\r\ncall him, Wenceslaus), was protected from Drahomíra’s influence by his\r\ngrandmother Ludmila; and thus the two brothers became the champions,\r\nthe one of the Christian, and the other of the heathen party, in the\r\nState. The Duke was so little conscious of the mischief that was\r\nbrewing that, after building the town of Bolislava in honour of his\r\nyounger son, he celebrated the occasion by building a church in that\r\ntown in honour of Cyril and Methodius; and he apparently sanctioned\r\nthat division of his territory between his sons which was carried out\r\nafter his death. No sooner, however, was Vratislav dead, than Drahomíra\r\ncommanded the Christians to close their churches; and this order was\r\nspeedily followed by a massacre; nor was Wenceslaus able to save even\r\nhis grandmother Ludmila from the vengeance of his mother. Indeed, this\r\nfavourite saint of the Bohemians seems to have had so little vigour,\r\nas a ruler, that he could not protect even the clergy, whom he most\r\ndesired to favour, from the intimidation of Boleslav and Drahomíra.\r\nThus, for instance, when he invited the Bishop of Regensburg to\r\nconsecrate a new church at Prague, the bishop was so terrified by the\r\nthreats of his enemies that he dared not come. It would, indeed, be\r\nunjust to deny that the position of a Christian Duke in the midst of\r\nthis sudden revival of heathenism was a most difficult and dangerous\r\none; nor is there the smallest ground to suspect Wenceslaus of\r\npersonal cowardice. On the contrary, he is represented on two occasions\r\nas offering personal combat to an invading prince, in order to save his\r\ncountry from the evils of war; and no doubt, according to his lights,\r\nhe was very willing to sacrifice himself for the good of Bohemia. Yet\r\none cannot but detect certain weaknesses in his career, which may well\r\nhave alarmed some of the stronger, if coarser, statesmen, who stood\r\nnear the throne; and though he distinguished himself by many acts\r\nof benevolence and devotion, and succeeded on several occasions in\r\npreserving peace and preventing bloodshed, yet it was not wholly by\r\nhis virtues that he excited the indignation of the party led by his\r\nbrother. The tendency to encourage those who were engaged in other\r\nwork to become priests, and his excessive reliance on the authority\r\nof the Emperor, might well have given occasion to a more reasonable\r\nopposition than that which expressed itself in the mere persecution of\r\nthe Christians.\r\n\r\nNor is it a wholly satisfactory sign that his piety, like that of\r\nEdward the Confessor, took the form of a contempt for marriage, or,\r\nto use the ecclesiastical phrase, of the zeal for preserving his\r\nvirginity. He was therefore probably in the right when he meditated\r\nretiring into a Benedictine monastery; but the Pope, glad enough, no\r\ndoubt, to secure a Christian Duke on the throne of a half-converted\r\nnation, threw great difficulties in the way of his abdication. His\r\nmother and brother, indignant at the frustration of their hopes,\r\nresolved on murder; and as a first step, to their purpose, they invited\r\nWenceslaus to be present at the baptism of the son of Boleslav. So\r\nunexpected a concession to Christianity aroused the suspicions of\r\nWenceslaus; but his religion throughout seems to have had a touch of\r\nfatalism, and he went to the feast in the full expectation of death.\r\nWhile the revelry was at its height, he withdrew from the table to\r\nworship in the church; and it was there that Boleslav found him and\r\nmurdered him, while he clung to the door of the church for safety. The\r\nmurder was followed by a general massacre of the Christian priests,\r\namong whom is especially mentioned Podiven, the follower known to\r\nEnglish readers as having warmed his feet by treading in the footsteps\r\nof his master.[3]\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor was naturally indignant at the murder of his\r\nfaithful _protégé_; and he exacted from Boleslav, as the price of\r\npeace, the recall of the banished Christians, the renewal of the\r\ntribute which he had just remitted to Wenceslaus, and an oath of\r\nallegiance, such as had hitherto been paid to the Emperor only by\r\nGerman princes. Boleslav was apparently induced to submit to these\r\nsevere terms, partly by his fear of the power of the Emperor, partly by\r\na sense of the danger which was still threatening the civilised States\r\nof Europe, a danger which could only be faced by an alliance with\r\nthe new ruler who had arisen in Germany. For while Bor̆ivoj and his\r\nsuccessors had been struggling to assert their power over their heathen\r\nsubjects, the old Saxon kingdom had succeeded in producing a champion\r\nof European freedom and civilisation.\r\n\r\nHenry the Fowler had thrown off the effete yoke of the Franks, and\r\nrallied the Germans under his banner; he had then routed the Hungarians\r\nat the celebrated battle of Merseburg, and had founded towns, by which\r\na new order of civilisation was being introduced into Germany. His son\r\nOtto was vigorously carrying on the struggle against the Hungarians;\r\nand Boleslav, however much he might dislike foreign rule, saw that an\r\nalliance with Otto was the only hope for his country. The Hungarians\r\nwere now advancing into Bohemia, and Boleslav encountered them on the\r\nfrontier and completely defeated them. He then proceeded to suppress\r\na robber tribe who had given much trouble to Wenceslaus, and who had\r\nestablished a castle on the borders of Bohemia, from whence they had\r\nharassed the country.\r\n\r\nThe chroniclers declare that Drahomíra was swallowed up in an\r\nearthquake, and perhaps her death removed the chief anti-Christian\r\ninfluence in the life of Boleslav; for, to whatever motives of\r\nconviction or policy the change may have been due, it is evident that,\r\nfrom this time forward, he not merely abandoned his persecution of the\r\nChristians, but used all his power to encourage their influence. The\r\nson whose baptism had been the occasion of the murder of Wenceslaus,\r\nbecame a monk; while the second son was trained with such effect in\r\nthe principles of Christianity that he afterwards gained the name of\r\nBoleslav the Pious. But to the father of these princes the Bohemian\r\nchroniclers are as inexorable as they had been to Svatopluk; and,\r\nwhile Wenceslaus is remembered as one of the chief national saints of\r\nBohemia, his brother lives in history as Boleslav the Cruel.\r\n\r\nIf the weaknesses of Wenceslaus tend to diminish our sympathies with\r\nthe movement of which he is the champion and martyr, we may perhaps\r\nfeel a more undivided interest in the next phase of the development\r\nof Bohemian Christianity, and a more unmixed admiration for the\r\nsaint who represents that period. There were two demands made by the\r\nChristian leaders in Bohemia which specially connected patriotism with\r\nreligion. These were the claim for a Slavonic ritual, and the attempt\r\nto establish an independent bishopric at Prague. But, though both of\r\nthese claims sprang from the feeling of national independence, it was\r\nonly the question of the bishopric, which appealed to such champions\r\nof Bohemia as Boleslav the Cruel. That strong and deep longing for the\r\nprotection and development of the national language, which expressed\r\nitself, at this time, in the cry for the Methodian ritual, was not a\r\nfeeling which the mere military champions of Bohemia could understand\r\nor recognise. The Pope seems to have been conscious of this division,\r\nand to have availed himself of it to make more grudging concessions\r\nto the national feeling than the merits of Boleslav the Pious, and\r\nthe memory of St. Wenceslaus might seem to have demanded. He granted,\r\nindeed, the free election of a bishop of Prague, and sanctioned, at the\r\nsame time, the foundation of a nunnery of which Boleslav’s sister was\r\nto be abbess; but he clogged the latter concession by the condition\r\nthat the Slavonic ritual should not be used in the new nunnery.\r\nPerhaps it was a similar desire for compromise which led Boleslav to\r\nrecommend to his clergy and people, for the first bishop, a Saxon named\r\nDettmar, who, however, was noted for his knowledge of the Bohemian\r\nlanguage. Friendship with Saxony was doubtless attractive to the\r\nwiser men of Bohemia, for more than one reason. It was the centre of\r\nthat resistance to the Hungarian power which they felt to be so vital\r\nto European civilisation. It contained a large proportion of men of\r\nSlavonic race; and Magdeburg, where Dettmar had been trained, was the\r\ngreat home of such learning and culture as were then to be found in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nBut the fierce heathen spirit, which had been strengthened by Boleslav\r\nthe Cruel, could not be suppressed at once either by his conversion, or\r\nby the probably sincerer piety of his son. It is now that the strong\r\nand cruel aristocracy of Bohemia begin to show their power both against\r\nking and people. Even in heathen times we hear of at least one family\r\nwho claimed a sort of equality with the royal line, and who continued\r\nduring the tenth and eleventh centuries to play much the same part\r\nas that of the Douglases in Scotland in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies. There was, however, one important difference between the\r\ncases. With all their selfishness and unscrupulousness, the Douglases\r\nalways stood by Scotland against its external enemies, while the\r\nVrs̆ovici were continually betraying Bohemia to Pole or German in order\r\nto gain their own ends. Nor were the Vrs̆ovici the only specimens of\r\na lawless and cruel class; and Boleslav the Pious and Bishop Dettmar\r\nsoon incurred the hatred of that class. The bishop, however, did not\r\nlong survive his appointment; and he was soon to be succeeded by a man\r\nfar more notable in Bohemian history. This man was Vojtĕch, the son of\r\na powerful Bohemian noble, who was as distinguished for his virtues as\r\nfor his wealth and rank. Vojtĕch, by the advice of Dettmar, had been\r\nsent by his parents to study at Magdeburg; and on his entrance into the\r\nclerical profession, he had received from the Archbishop of Magdeburg\r\nhis name of Adalbert. When he returned to Bohemia, he was called to\r\nsucceed Dettmar in the bishopric of Prague. He soon began to denounce\r\nthe state of morals around him. Divorce was frequent; impurity of\r\nall kinds terribly rife; and the nobles, not content with oppression\r\nat home, were constantly selling their unfortunate dependants into\r\nslavery. The stern denunciations of Adalbert soon roused against him\r\nthe hatred of his own class, which was increased in bitterness by the\r\nrivalry between his family and that of the Vrs̆ovici.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a woman, whom he had saved from her angry husband and\r\nsent into a nunnery, was dragged out and murdered by her husband.\r\nBoleslav desired to repress such violence by the sword; Adalbert at\r\nfirst persuaded him to abstain from bloodshed; but, when the insurgent\r\nnobles built a fortress on the banks of the Elbe, from which they\r\nharassed all the Christians who came that way, the king felt bound to\r\nact; so he marched against the insurgents and signally defeated them.\r\nAdalbert, horrified at being in any way the cause of bloodshed, fled\r\nto Pannonia, which had now been conquered by the Hungarians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH BUILT BY ST. ADALBERT AT PRAHATICE.]\r\n\r\nGeysa, the leading chief of the Hungarians in that district, was a\r\nhospitable and large-minded man, who welcomed strangers heartily.\r\nAdalbert used the opportunity to teach Christianity, and many of the\r\nHungarians were converted. Amongst other converts was Geysa himself,\r\nwho consented to have his son Stephen christened by Adalbert. Over this\r\nchild Adalbert’s influence was evidently great; and when Stephen grew\r\nup, he became the first Christian king of Hungary, recognised as such\r\nboth by Pope and Emperor. From the reign of St. Stephen the Hungarians\r\nthemselves reckon their beginning as a settled monarchy; and thus they\r\nowe their change from the condition of a marauding horde to an orderly\r\nand progressive nation, to the teaching of the Bohemian saint.\r\n\r\nTwice Adalbert was recalled to Bohemia, and twice he again left it in\r\ndisgust. On the last occasion he took refuge with the King of Poland,\r\nand from thence went to convert the heathen Prussians, by whom he was\r\nkilled. His body was brought back by the Poles and buried at Gnesen.\r\nNext to the actual memory of his life, his most notable legacy to\r\nhis country is the hymn which he wrote in the native language, and\r\nwhich soon became, and long remained, a kind of war-cry of Bohemian\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nRELATIONS OF BOHEMIA TO POLAND AND TO THE EMPIRE IN THE ELEVENTH,\r\nTWELFTH, AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES.\r\n\r\n(997-1253.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invasion of the Hungarians had changed the attitude of Bohemia,\r\nas of other countries, towards the German Empire. The necessity of\r\nsaving themselves from the ruin which overwhelmed the dukedom of\r\nMoravia, naturally compelled the Bohemians to recognise their former\r\nenemies as their only sure protectors; and, as the vigorous line of\r\nSaxon princes put new force into the German kingdom, this relation\r\nbecame necessarily closer. But it was long before the German rulers\r\nwere able to realise that they could gain any help, in turn, from\r\nthe rising dukedom of Bohemia. Torn by the divisions between heathen\r\nand Christian, distracted to an unusual degree by family quarrels,\r\nharassed by powerful neighbours, Bohemia seemed, in the tenth and\r\nearly part of the eleventh century, more fitted to be the tool or the\r\nprey of the Emperors than their ally. Nor was it only a weakening of\r\ninternal security which had been produced by the Magyar invasion. The\r\nbreak-up of Slavonic unity, by the overthrow of Svatopluk, had caused a\r\nconfusion of races in certain districts, which made them the subject of\r\ndispute between rival powers.\r\n\r\nOf these mixed lands, the two in which Bohemia was most interested,\r\nwere the district of Lusatia (afterwards called the Lausitz), over\r\nwhich she disputed with Saxony, and the even more variously peopled\r\nprovince of Silesia, which was the great cause of controversy between\r\nBohemia and Poland. Of these two subjects of difference the Silesian\r\nquestion was the far more pressing and important. The common feeling of\r\ndanger, produced by Hungarian invasion, had, indeed, affected Poland\r\nas much as other European countries; but, as the raids of the invaders\r\ngrew less frequent, the sense of union, developed by that danger, grew\r\nweaker; and when the Hungarians began to settle down as a peaceable and\r\nChristian nation, the Poles began to abandon their defensive attitude,\r\nand gradually to become aggressive in their turn.\r\n\r\nNor was the Silesian question the only cause of jealousy between Poland\r\nand Bohemia. The town of Cracow, the former capital of Croatia, was\r\nas much desired by both the rival nations as Silesia could be; since\r\nit was important both for military and political purposes. Moreover\r\nthose ecclesiastical considerations, which were always influencing\r\nthe foreign politics of Bohemia, played a somewhat important part in\r\nthe struggle with Poland. The desire of the Polish Duke to secure the\r\nburial of Adalbert at Gnesen had not been wholly due to religious\r\nfeelings. The kings and bishops of Poland wished to make Gnesen the\r\ncentre of a large diocese, in which Prague should hold a subordinate\r\nposition; and an offer of money which the Duke of Poland made to\r\na Bohemian monastery founded by Adalbert, was no doubt intended\r\nas a bribe to the monks, to induce them to further these schemes\r\nof ecclesiastical and political ambition. These enterprises were\r\nunfortunately aided by that treacherous family, the Vrs̆ovici, who\r\nhad already played so fatal a part in their country’s history. They\r\nseem to have again tried to carry out their treasons by stirring up\r\nfamily jealousy. Young Boleslav, a nephew of Boleslav the Pious, showed\r\nhimself eager to assert his claims to the Dukedom of Bohemia. Mĕs̆ek of\r\nPoland encouraged his kinsman’s intrigues, and, by a sudden surprise,\r\nCracow was seized, and Silesia was overrun by the Polish troops.\r\n\r\nBoleslav the Pious demanded reparation for this outrage, and\r\ncircumstances soon gave him the opportunity for revenge. A Russian\r\nchief unexpectedly invaded Poland and laid waste a great part of it.\r\nBoleslav the Pious seized this opportunity to recover Cracow, and he\r\nplaced there a governor of sufficient vigour to hold the fortress\r\nagainst all attempts of the Poles to recover it, even after they had\r\nsucceeded in making peace with Russia. Indeed the new governor would\r\nwillingly have extended the Bohemian territory by making reprisals on\r\nPoland; but this was strictly forbidden by the Duke of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe death of Boleslav the Pious, and the accession to the dukedom\r\nof his weak and profligate son, Boleslav the Third, gave a new\r\nopportunity both to native and foreign intrigues. Indeed the Vrs̆ovici\r\nare represented by some historians as acting in this reign rather the\r\npart of patriotic opponents of a tyrant than of selfish intriguers for\r\npower. It is, however, unfortunately clear that they did not abandon\r\ntheir intrigues with the Polish pretender; and he was able to take\r\nadvantage of the non-payment of the soldiers in the garrison of Cracow\r\nto stir up division in the fortress. By this means he was once more\r\nable to surprise the garrison, and to put all the Bohemians to the\r\nsword. Great confusion now followed; the German Emperor, Henry II.,\r\nseized the opportunity of fishing in troubled waters, and something\r\nlike a conquest of Bohemia by Poland was for a time the result of this\r\nstruggle. The accounts, however, of the details of the struggle seem\r\nuncertain and contradictory; and it is not until the Bohemians had in\r\nsome measure re-established their independence that we once more find\r\nourselves on firm ground.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, it is just when we have reached a point at which\r\nmodern research and early tradition seem to be in practical harmony\r\nthat we light upon a series of stories of the most romantic kind.\r\nOldr̆ich, the brother of Boleslav III., had been established on\r\nthe throne after the expulsion of the Poles. He seems to have been\r\nan eccentric prince, given to somewhat unconventional explorations\r\nof his kingdom. In one of these wanderings he came upon a handsome\r\npeasant-girl washing clothes in a stream. He at once fell in love with\r\nher, and soon after woo’d, won, and married her. The great ladies of\r\nthe court at first resented the arrival of the peasant-queen; but in\r\ntime the grace and courtesy of Beatrix broke down the opposition of her\r\njealous critics, and the birth of her son Brac̆islav was celebrated\r\nwith splendid feasts. Brac̆islav was to be the future hero and\r\nrestorer of the greatness of his country; and, as usual, the political\r\nand military revival of Bohemia is preluded by a reawakening of the\r\ninterest in the national language.\r\n\r\nIn another of his wanderings Oldr̆ich found, in the depth of the\r\nforest, an old hermit, to whom he confessed his sins; and he was\r\nso much impressed by the power and saintliness of the man, that he\r\npersuaded him to leave his solitary life, to return to the town, and\r\nto assist the duke and other pious men in founding the monastery of\r\nSázava. He soon found that this hermit had in his keeping copies of\r\nthe old Slavonic services introduced into Bohemia by Methodius, which\r\nhad doubtless disappeared from the country in the recent troubles.\r\nEncouraged by Oldr̆ich, and at a later time by his son Brac̆islav, the\r\nnational ritual was rapidly extended from Sázava to other churches.\r\n\r\nOldr̆ich bequeathed to his son both his zeal for the national language\r\nand the national independence, and also the love of romantic adventure.\r\nEven before his accession to the throne, Brac̆islav had attracted\r\nattention as a hero of romance. He had made a sudden expedition to the\r\nnunnery of Schweinfurt, to carry off from thence the beautiful daughter\r\nof a German Count. The gate of the nunnery was secured by a bar; but\r\nBrac̆islav cut through the bar with his sword, and carried off his\r\nbride in triumph, though some of his followers were cut off and killed.\r\nBut the great purpose of his life was to recover the ground which\r\nBohemia had lost in her struggle with Poland. Even before his accession\r\nto the throne, he had reconquered the greater part of the province of\r\nMoravia, which the Poles had torn away from Bohemia; and, as soon as he\r\nbecame duke, he resolved to carry his plans yet further, and to invade\r\nPoland itself. The death of Duke Casimir of Poland, and the infancy of\r\nhis successor, facilitated this expedition. Brac̆islav retook Cracow\r\nby storm, overran much of Silesia, and transplanted many of the Poles\r\nto Bohemia, where he suffered them to maintain their old laws and\r\ncustoms. He then marched to Gnesen, the centre of the intended scheme\r\nfor establishing the ecclesiastical supremacy of Poland over Bohemia.\r\nThe city was ill-defended, and Brac̆islav entered it in triumph.\r\n\r\nThen followed one of those scenes which show how strangely the fiercer\r\nelements in the Bohemian character were checked and crossed by\r\ninfluences like those of St. Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. It will be\r\nremembered that the body of the latter saint had been buried by the\r\nking of Poland at Gnesen, and Brac̆islav had many motives for desiring\r\nto recover so valuable a possession. But the scene which preceded\r\nthe restoration of the national saint to the country, which had so\r\nill-treated him during his life, is curiously unlike the ordinary\r\nperformances of a military conqueror; and, if there are any who think\r\nthat such a mediæval legend is beneath the dignity of history, they\r\nshould remember that the historian Cosmas, who has preserved it for us,\r\nwas a man actively engaged in the ordinary political affairs of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt first the Bohemians were disposed to carry things with a high hand;\r\nand, in spite of the warnings of the chief pastor of the town, they\r\ntore down the altar which covered the body, in order to seize it the\r\nmore easily. For this offence they were struck dumb and blind for the\r\nspace of three hours; and on recovering their senses they consented\r\nto submit to a three days’ fast before taking further action. On the\r\nthird day the same priest, who had warned them of the consequences of\r\ntheir sacrilege, told them that he had had a vision of St. Adalbert;\r\nand that the saint had bidden him to tell the Duke and his companions\r\nthat the Father in Heaven would give them what they asked, if they did\r\nnot repeat those evil deeds which they abjured in their baptism. On\r\nthe morning following this announcement, the Duke and his followers\r\nentered the church and prostrated themselves before the tomb of St.\r\nAdalbert. Then the Duke arose and addressed them as follows: “Do you\r\nwish to amend your errors and to turn from evil works to wisdom?” To\r\nthis they answered, “We are prepared to amend whatever our fathers or\r\nwe have done wrong against this saint of God, and to cease from every\r\nevil work.” Then the Duke, extending his hand over the sacred tomb,\r\naddressed the crowd as follows: “Stretch out, my brothers, your hands\r\nto God, and listen to my discourses, which I wish you to confirm your\r\nfaith in by an oath. Therefore, let this be my first and most urgent\r\ndecree; that your marriages, which you have hitherto treated as if they\r\nwere mere fornications, and like the union of brute animals, should\r\nin future be made lawful, according to canonical rules, private and\r\nindissoluble, so that each husband shall be content with one wife, and\r\neach wife with one husband. But, if a wife shall despise a husband, or\r\na husband his wife, and if a quarrel between them shall boil over into\r\na separation, then I do not will that the one of them that refuses to\r\nreturn to lawful union shall be made a slave according to the custom of\r\nour land; but rather that, by the slavery of our unchangeable decree,\r\nsuch persons, whoever they may be, shall be carried into Hungary; and\r\nit shall not be permitted to them to buy their liberty, or to return to\r\nthis land, lest the contagion of one little sheep should creep into the\r\nwhole sheep-fold of Christ.” Then the pastor of the church answered:\r\n“Let him who does otherwise be anathema.”\r\n\r\nAfter further provisions for enforcing purity of life, the Duke added,\r\n“But, if a woman shall have declared publicly that she was not loved\r\nas an equal, but was afflicted and persecuted by her husband, let the\r\njudgment of God be given between them; and let the one who is found\r\nguilty pay the penalty.” Further provisions were then introduced for\r\npunishing homicides; but with regard to murderers of fathers, brothers,\r\nor priests, they were to be bound by hand and belly with iron, and\r\nsent out of the kingdom, to wander, like Cain, over the whole earth.\r\nThose, again, who set up taverns, which are the source of all crimes\r\nand impurities, were to be anathema; and he who was caught in the act\r\nof keeping a tavern was to be hung, and his drinks to be poured out\r\nupon the earth, lest any one should be polluted by this execrable\r\ndraught. Further provisions then followed against holding markets\r\nor doing servile works on Sunday, and against burial of the dead in\r\nunconsecrated places.\r\n\r\nAfter these sins had been denounced as offensive unto God, and as\r\nthe cause why St. Adalbert left his native country, all present were\r\ncalled upon to assent to the changes of conduct proposed. When they\r\nhad done so the archbishop broke open the tomb, and disclosed the body\r\nof the saint. So delicious, says Cosmas, was the smell which came out\r\nthat many seemed as if they had tasted rich food, and for three days\r\nthey needed no more; many sick were healed; yet only the Duke, the\r\narchbishop, and the nobles were suffered to see the body. They then\r\nprayed St. Adalbert to allow them to carry him to Prague; and the Duke\r\nand bishop, taking the body from the tomb, wrapped it in silk, and set\r\nout with it in a solemn procession. After the body were carried the\r\nspoils taken from the Poles; and the Polish nobles (among whom was the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Cosmas) followed the procession as prisoners,\r\ntheir hands and necks being loaded with irons.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that Brac̆islav’s proceedings would pass\r\nunchallenged; and both Pope and Emperor were appealed to, to redress\r\nthe wrongs done to the Church and to Poland. Both of them answered\r\nthe appeal; but the complaints of the Pope were soon silenced by the\r\nbuilding of a monastery, and by the judicious distribution of money\r\namong the cardinals. Henry III. was not so easily satisfied. He had\r\ndoubtless adopted the Imperial policy of playing off the rival kingdoms\r\nagainst each other; and the Bohemian victories, won so easily, and\r\nwithout his intervention, were most unwelcome. His avarice, moreover,\r\nwas roused by the news of the booty which Brac̆islav had brought back\r\nfrom Poland. He therefore peremptorily demanded the surrender of the\r\nspoil, under pain of war. Brac̆islav boldly replied that, “while the\r\nBohemians were willing to pay to the Emperor that tribute which they\r\nhad always paid him, they would resist to the death any attempt to lay\r\non them unlawful burdens.” Henry retorted that the law had a wax nose,\r\nwhich a king could always bend with his iron hand.\r\n\r\nSuch an exchange of courtesies was naturally followed by war; and,\r\nwhile a Saxon army marched into Bohemia on one side, the Emperor\r\nhimself speedily followed by another entrance. But the Bohemians were\r\nready for the invasion; and, while the imperial army were resting in a\r\nwood, they were surprised by Brac̆islav’s soldiers and cut to pieces,\r\nHenry only saving himself by the swiftness of his horse. The Duke of\r\nSaxony in vain tried to make terms with the Bohemians, and was speedily\r\nforced to retreat to his own country.\r\n\r\nThis success, indeed, was not quite so complete as it seemed at first;\r\nfor, in the following year, Henry once more invaded Bohemia, and\r\ngained such successes that Brac̆islav was compelled to pay a higher\r\ntribute, and to restore many towns to Poland. Nevertheless, he was able\r\nto retain some hold even over those towns, by exacting a perpetual\r\ntribute from them; nor was Bohemia ever again so completely at the\r\nmercy of Poland as it had been in the previous reigns.\r\n\r\nThe divisions in the Bohemian Ducal family seemed, however, to\r\nBrac̆islav to be as great a danger as could arise from any foreign\r\nenemy; and he persuaded the nobles to guard against such dangers in the\r\nfuture by making the crown hereditary in his family, and abandoning\r\nthe unlimited right of election. Such a law could not finally prevent\r\nfamily quarrels, or defeat the designs of ambitious adventurers. But it\r\nis worth noting, as indicating the feeling of an able ruler about the\r\ndangers to which his country was exposed.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that the conduct of Henry III. and the\r\nDuke of Saxony had quickened once more in Bohemia that anti-German\r\nfeeling, which the struggles with the Magyars and the Poles had\r\nfor a time forced into the background. Brac̆islav had, no doubt,\r\nbeen statesman enough to restrain such a feeling within due bounds;\r\nbut, when his son Spitihnĕv came to the throne, he gave far fiercer\r\nexpression to his hatred of the old enemies of Bohemia. No sooner was\r\nhe established in his power, than he issued a decree ordering all\r\nthe Germans to leave the country; nor was even his mother allowed\r\nan exemption from this sentence. His brother Vratislav set himself\r\nagainst this policy, and tried to make the province of Moravia a centre\r\nof opposition to the king. But Spitihnĕv invaded Moravia, forced\r\nVratislav to fly to Hungary, and treated his wife with such cruelty\r\nthat she died from the effects. In order to make his power yet more\r\nsecure, the Duke persuaded his other brothers, Otto and Conrad, to\r\nabandon their claims to the special districts of Moravia, which their\r\nfather had granted to them, and to come to the ducal court at Prague.\r\n\r\nSpitihnĕv, however, like Svatopluk of Moravia and Boleslav the\r\nCruel, was one of those violent men who are subject to reactions as\r\ninexplicable as their first outbursts. Under the influence of the\r\nBishop of Prague, he consented to be reconciled to Vratislav, and to\r\nallow him to return to Moravia; and this concession was a prelude to\r\na complete change of policy. So mild, indeed, did he become, that he\r\ngained the reputation of being a friend to the poor, a just judge, and\r\nan encourager of religion.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say to which part of his reign we are to assign an\r\nact, which seems at first sight a strange contrast with his furious\r\nnational prejudices. This was his suppression of the Slavonic ritual\r\nin the monastery of Sázava. But the apparent inconsistency is easily\r\nexplained. The Emperors and Popes were no longer the props of each\r\nother’s power; for Henry III. had struck out that new policy, which\r\naimed at the humiliation of the Papacy, and the exaltation of the\r\nEmpire at its expense. Under these circumstances, a king of Bohemia\r\nwho wished to hurl defiance at the Germans and their ruler, was\r\nnecessarily forced to rely on the support of the Pope. Now the very\r\nbitterness of the struggle against the German Empire had crushed out\r\nthose ideas of tolerance towards national feeling which had prevailed\r\nin the days of John VIII. The Slavonic ritual represented at once\r\na concession to the Greek heresy, and a substitution of a national\r\nlanguage for the Latin, which symbolised the power of the Papacy.\r\nSpitihnĕv, therefore, was obliged to suppress this incitement to heresy\r\nbefore he could obtain the help of the Papacy against the Emperor.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever changes might have marked the closing years of\r\nSpitihnĕv’s reign, he could not hope at once to suppress that fierce\r\nspirit of national hatred which he had called into prominence;\r\nespecially since it had entwined itself, in many cases, with personal\r\nambitions and jealousies. When, then, Vratislav succeeded to his\r\nbrother’s dukedom, he found himself in an exceptionally difficult\r\nposition. The persecution which he had suffered from his brother\r\nnaturally inclined him to a reversal of Spitihnĕv’s policy; but he\r\nfound that the rest of his family by no means shared his desire for\r\nsuch a change. The most turbulent and ambitious of his brothers was\r\nnamed Jaromír. He had been early persuaded to enter deacon’s orders,\r\nin the hope of ultimately succeeding to the bishopric of Prague. Soon,\r\nhowever, he wearied of a life for which he had no natural inclination;\r\nhe therefore fled to Poland, and entered the Polish army. When, then,\r\nthe Bishop of Prague died, Vratislav naturally felt that any claim\r\nwhich Jaromír might have founded on former promises, was cancelled by\r\nhis desertion of his profession; and this seemed a good opportunity for\r\nintroducing the new policy of conciliation of the Germans. Vratislav,\r\ntherefore, offered the bishopric to a Saxon chaplain named Lanczo.\r\nThough Saxon birth might have special recommendations to those who\r\nremembered St. Adalbert’s training at Magdeburg, yet, on the other\r\nhand, the share which the Saxons had taken in the invasions of Henry\r\nIII. had produced a deep feeling of resentment in many Bohemians.\r\nConrad and Otto resolved to give expression to these discontents, by\r\npersuading Jaromír to renew his tonsure; and they resolved to support\r\nhis claim to the bishopric.\r\n\r\nVratislav hoped to solve the difficulty by an appeal to a General\r\nAssembly. The Assembly met, and Vratislav in their presence presented\r\nLanczo with the episcopal ring and staff. For a few moments dead\r\nsilence followed this act; then, after some mutterings amongst\r\nthemselves, several nobles sprang up, and announced their intention to\r\nsupport the claims of Jaromír by force of arms. The opposition was so\r\nfierce that Vratislav yielded, and Jaromír was made Bishop of Prague.\r\n\r\nBut the ambition of the new bishop was not yet satisfied. It had been\r\nfound necessary, in a previous reign, to divide the diocese into two\r\nparts, one Bohemian and one Moravian; and the Bishop of Olomouci\r\n(Olmütz) was then made practically independent of the Bishop of Prague.\r\nJaromír now demanded that the Bishop of Olmütz should be deposed, and\r\nhis diocese absorbed in the diocese of Prague. This proposal was, of\r\ncourse, opposed by Vratislav; whereupon Jaromír went secretly to\r\nOlmütz and assaulted his rival bishop, injuring him severely. Vratislav\r\nnow felt that the time had come to appeal to the Pope against his\r\nunruly brother. Alexander II. sent a legate to Bohemia to try the case;\r\nbut, though the Duke and the nobles received him with great honour,\r\nJaromír denied the authority of the Papal emissary, and refused to\r\nresign the see at his bidding.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not a time when the Pope could be bearded with\r\nimpunity. In 1073 Alexander died, and Hildebrand was chosen Pope, with\r\nthe title of Gregory VII. He summoned Jaromír to Rome; and, after a\r\nshort attempt at resistance, the turbulent prince submitted to that\r\npowerful will. But even Gregory had allies with whom he could not\r\ndispense; and Matilda of Tuscany, who was connected with the Bohemian\r\nducal family, chose to interest herself on Jaromír’s behalf, made\r\nup a temporary reconciliation between the brothers, and persuaded\r\nthe Pope to restore Jaromír to the bishopric of Prague, after he had\r\nperformed some kind of penance, and had given a promise to abstain from\r\ninterference with the Bishop of Olmütz. Jaromír, therefore, returned to\r\nBohemia, and continued to be a thorn in the side of his brother, and of\r\nall his order-loving countrymen.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that neither the conduct of Jaromír nor of Gregory can\r\nhave tended to sweeten Vratislav’s feelings towards the anti-German\r\nparty; and his personal resentment and the desire for greater security\r\nfor his throne, doubtless mingled with larger considerations, to\r\nrecommend to him an important change in Bohemian policy, which was\r\nvitally to affect the future of the country.\r\n\r\nEver since the death of Henry II., the Bohemian Dukes had had a new\r\nchance for playing a part in the affairs of the German Empire. The six\r\nGerman princes, to whom the Saxon Emperors had wished to limit the\r\nright of election to the Empire, had found it impossible, or at least,\r\nextremely difficult, to come to a satisfactory decision on occasions\r\nwhen the champions of rival candidates were equally divided. So they\r\nwere forced to add the Duke of Bohemia as a seventh Elector, to secure\r\na better chance of a satisfactory decision, and in 1024 Duke Oldr̆ich\r\nhad actually taken part in an Imperial Election. At that time, no\r\ndoubt, the Emperors were still strong enough to dispense with allies\r\nwho were not directly and naturally connected with the Empire; but when\r\nthe struggle with the Popes began, the need for fresh support became\r\nmore evident, and the friendship of the new Elector of the Empire\r\nbecame more valuable.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, in 1075, Vratislav offered his help to the Emperor in the\r\nstruggle which was then becoming desperate, his alliance was gladly\r\nwelcomed. Henry IV. had just then been excommunicated by Gregory for\r\nhis opposition to the Papal claims over the German bishoprics; and he\r\nwas threatened with rebellion by some of his most powerful subjects.\r\nVratislav’s opportunity was therefore well chosen; and throughout the\r\nmany changes of fortune in his stormy career, Henry found his new ally\r\nboth faithful and helpful. Many victories were gained by the help\r\nof the Bohemian soldiers; and perhaps the most noteworthy battle, as\r\naffecting the future Bohemian history, was that at Mailberg in 1082,\r\nwhen Vratislav, with the help of the Bavarians, defeated Leopold,\r\nMargrave of Austria, who had just revolted against Henry. The Emperor\r\nwould gladly have presented the Mark of Austria to the victorious Duke;\r\nbut Vratislav wisely shrank from this extension of his dominions. Other\r\noffers of territory by Henry were either declined by the Duke or found\r\nincapable of execution; and at last, in 1086, the Emperor, finding no\r\nother reward acceptable to his ally, publicly recognised Vratislav as\r\nKing of Bohemia, and released him from tribute to the Empire.\r\n\r\nThus Bohemia passed for the moment from a position of dependence to one\r\nof equal alliance with the German Emperor. It might seem, indeed, when\r\none considers the later developments of Bohemian history, as if the\r\ncountry would have been happier had it held aloof from the quarrels of\r\nEmperors and Popes, and developed itself on narrower and more peaceful\r\nlines. But, by the statesmen of that time, the matter must have been\r\nseen in a very different light. The perpetual interference by Emperors,\r\nPopes, and Kings of Poland in the internal affairs of Bohemia seemed to\r\nhave become an unavoidable evil; and the only apparent remedy was to\r\nseize the moment when the Emperor was in difficulty, and to show him\r\nthat his despised dependant might become a necessary ally.\r\n\r\nBut the general character of Vratislav’s policy justifies us in\r\nattributing to him higher motives than those above mentioned. He seems\r\nto have really desired to encourage a wider development of thought\r\nand culture in Bohemia. Both Germans and Jews were granted special\r\nprivileges to induce them to settle in Prague; and it may well be\r\nbelieved that he hoped to extend this connection between Bohemia and\r\nthe European world, by concerning himself with the politics of the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nNor did he fail to do honour to native excellence. One man in\r\nparticular stands out amongst his favourites, as a proof of Vratislav’s\r\nsympathy with artistic power. This was Boz̆etĕch, who was distinguished\r\nboth as painter, sculptor, and architect. Such a variety of excellence\r\nso attracted the Duke that he appointed Boz̆etĕch as Abbot of Sázava;\r\nand by his help he once more brought back into use the often-disputed\r\nSlavonic ritual. Pope Gregory, indeed, indignantly demanded its\r\nsuppression; but Vratislav, strong in the support of the Emperor and of\r\nthe general feeling of Bohemia, stood firm on behalf of this symbol of\r\nnational life. Unfortunately, rulers who choose their favourites for\r\nmerit rather than for birth, naturally rouse the hostility of those\r\ncourtiers, who have only the latter claim to distinction; and while\r\nBoz̆etĕch was sternly rebuked for presumption by the Bishop of Prague,\r\nanother favourite of Vratislav’s gave offence to the heir to the\r\nthrone, and was murdered by the young prince and his followers.\r\n\r\nThis act of violence is one proof among many that Vratislav’s policy\r\nwas too vigorous for the leaders of Bohemian opinion. His successors\r\ncould not maintain Bohemia in the position in which he would have\r\nplaced her; and even the royal title fell into disuse, in consequence,\r\npartly, of the disputes about the succession. Indeed, the chief\r\nevidence of the progress, which Bohemia had made under Vratislav, is\r\nto be found in the fact that the internal quarrels which followed\r\nhis reign were not able to drag the country down to the condition\r\ninto which she had previously fallen. Poland was not able to recover\r\nher hold over Bohemia; and Henry IV. was so conscious of his debt to\r\nVratislav that he refused to interfere in a contest between members of\r\nthe ducal family, on the ground that such questions should be left to\r\nthe free choice of the Bohemians themselves.\r\n\r\nIn spite, then, of Vratislav’s partial success, the divisions which\r\nfollowed his death could not fail to weaken Bohemia; and at last one\r\nof the Dukes resolved upon a terrible method for suppressing internal\r\ndisorder. This duke bore the name of Svatopluk; and his career was\r\nnot wholly unlike that of his namesake in the old Moravian times. By\r\nthe help of Mutina and Boz̆ej, two of the leaders of the Vrs̆ovici,\r\nhe had deposed Duke Bor̆ivoj, and placed himself upon the throne of\r\nBohemia. Bor̆ivoj appealed to Polish support for the recovery of his\r\nkingdom; and, during Svatopluk’s absence, he invaded Bohemia at the\r\nhead of a Polish army. Mutina, who had been left as one of Svatopluk’s\r\nchief representatives, offered little resistance to the invaders, and\r\nhe was, in consequence, denounced to the Duke as having intrigued with\r\nBor̆ivoj. Thereupon Svatopluk resolved to destroy the whole race of\r\nthe Vrs̆ovici. He summoned all the nobles to a banquet in Breslau;\r\nand among them came Mutina, not suspecting what was to follow. At\r\nthe close of the banquet Svatopluk suddenly turned upon Mutina, and\r\naccused him and his family of being the authors of all the treasons\r\nin Bohemia for many years past. Then he made a sign to an officer,\r\nwho rushed upon Mutina and cut off his head as he was trying to rise\r\nfrom his seat. His sons were then seized and their eyes put out.\r\nThen messengers were despatched all over the country, who hunted out\r\nevery member of the family of the Vrs̆ovici, and killed all whom they\r\ncould seize--men, women, and children. Some of them fled, to Poland,\r\nand others to Hungary; and for a long time the family was unknown in\r\nBohemia. But this savage act of vengeance did not produce the general\r\nresults at which its author had aimed. Svatopluk himself was murdered\r\nduring an invasion of Poland by one of the exiled Vrs̆ovici; and the\r\nsucceeding reign was as much disturbed by family quarrels as any which\r\nhad preceded it.\r\n\r\nBut the real stability of Bohemia, and the substantial unity which\r\nunder-lay its divisions, were to be proved very soon, by a most\r\nsearching test. In 1125 the line of the Franconian sovereigns of\r\nGermany ended; and Lothar, Duke of Saxony, was chosen Emperor. It will\r\nbe remembered that the Saxons had now for some time been recognised\r\nas the most dangerous rivals of Bohemia; and, at the time of Lothar’s\r\naccession, an opportunity seemed to offer itself for using the Imperial\r\npower to crush out Bohemian independence. Sobeslav, the next Duke of\r\nBohemia, had just obtained the throne by the influence of his mother\r\nSvatava, who had persuaded the Bohemian nobles to ignore the claims of\r\nher eldest son, Otto. Otto at once appealed to Lothar, who asserted his\r\nright, as Emperor, to decide the succession to the Dukedom of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nSuch a claim would have been resented at any time; but Otto had\r\nspecially offended Bohemian feeling, by consenting to hold the province\r\nof Moravia as a fief from the Emperor, instead of a dependency of the\r\nDuke of Bohemia. All the national feeling of independence at once burst\r\ninto flame; Sobeslav answered Lothar “that he trusted in the mercy of\r\nGod, and in the merits of the holy martyrs of Christ, St. Wenceslaus,\r\nand St. Adalbert, that our country would not be delivered into the\r\nhands of foreigners.” Then he went round to the monasteries imploring\r\nDivine help; and when he finally set out on his march, the spear of\r\nSt. Wenceslaus and the banner of St. Adalbert were carried at the head\r\nof the army. At the same time Sobeslav despatched a message to the\r\nEmperor, reminding him that the Bohemian nobles were the sole electors\r\nof their duke, and that the Emperor had only the right of confirming\r\ntheir choice. But Otto had filled the leaders of the Saxon army with\r\nthe belief that the nobles of Bohemia were on their side; so the\r\nEmperor and his friends declared that Sobeslav’s speech was mere raving.\r\n\r\nFollowing Otto’s guidance, the Saxon army now marched through a thick\r\nwood till they came to the pass of Chlum. Here they found themselves\r\nwedged in between two mountains, and so blocked by the snow that they\r\nhad to dismount from their horses. While the invaders were thus cut\r\noff from any hope of retreat, Sobeslav’s army broke in upon them from\r\nthree different sides. Surprised and unable to defend themselves, the\r\nSaxons were cut to pieces; while many of the Bohemians were encouraged\r\nby visions of St. Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. So great was the victory\r\nthat, in the words of one chronicler, “there was rejoicing through all\r\nthe family of St. Wenceslaus.” Lothar admitted that he had been misled\r\nby Otto, recognised the “judgment of God,” and presented Sobeslav with\r\nthe ducal standard.\r\n\r\nSobeslav, like all the wiser rulers of Bohemia, while determined to\r\nmaintain the independence of his country, was unwilling to provoke any\r\nneedless quarrel with Germany. Even with Lothar he soon entered into\r\nfriendly relations; and, after the death of the Saxon Emperor, he used\r\nhis vote as Elector of the Empire on behalf of Conrad of Hohenstauffen.\r\nOnce more the connection between Bohemia and the Empire became one\r\nof close friendship; and Sobeslav appealed to Conrad to confirm his\r\nnomination of his son Vladislav as successor to the throne. Evidently\r\nfearing the divisions which might follow his death, Sobeslav further\r\nstrengthened Vladislav’s position by securing a special promise from\r\nthe nobles and knights that they would accept this prince as their\r\nduke. The correctness of Sobeslav’s fears was soon proved by the events\r\nwhich followed his death. When in 1140 the duke was known to be dying,\r\nthe nobles of Bohemia met at the Vys̆ehrad, where they consulted long\r\nabout the succession to the throne; and, though they finally decided\r\nto accept Vladislav as their duke, he soon found that his tenure of\r\nauthority was a frail and uncertain one.\r\n\r\nHis difficulties, indeed, were much increased by the reforming zeal\r\nof one of the most important of the statesmen on whom he had to\r\nrely. Zdík, Bishop of Olmütz, had just returned from a pilgrimage\r\nto Palestine, full of eager enthusiasm for establishing a new order\r\nof things. By this “new order” he understood a revival of clerical\r\ndiscipline, an increase of monasteries, and a stricter enforcement of\r\ngeneral purity of life. Vladislav sympathised with the bishop’s zeal;\r\nand he had also enthusiasms of his own, which were equally difficult of\r\nrealisation. He removed corrupt magistrates, and he insisted that his\r\nsubjects should have the right to appeal to him against the decisions\r\nof those subordinate courts which often represented rather the will of\r\nthe lords than the intentions of the law.\r\n\r\nSuch reforms, however welcome to the peasants, the townsfolk, and the\r\nstricter clergy, were bitterly opposed by the nobles, whose power\r\nthey weakened, and whose oppressions they redressed. Therefore, in\r\n1142, the nobles again met, to depose Vratislav from the throne, and\r\nto choose a successor in his place. After some discussion, they fixed\r\nupon Conrad, the Margrave of Moravia, and placed him at the head of the\r\ninsurgent forces. Vladislav soon heard of their intrigues; and, while\r\nhe entrusted the Bishop of Olmütz with the organisation of the ducal\r\ntroops, he himself sent messengers to the conspirators, reminding\r\nthem of their oaths of allegiance; and he specially appealed to his\r\ncousin Otto, the son of the prince who had headed the Saxon invasion,\r\nreproaching him with the fact that he had just restored him to his\r\nfather’s lands. But all these appeals were in vain; the insurgent army\r\nadvanced to “Vizoca,” where they were encountered by Vladislav. The\r\nfight was a fierce one, and many of the leading nobles were killed;\r\nbut at last, by pretending a panic, they decoyed the ducal army into a\r\ndangerous position, and there turned on them and routed them. Vladislav\r\nretreated to Prague; and then, leaving his brother Theobald to defend\r\nthe city, he went to the Emperor to ask his assistance. The Emperor\r\nremembered his debt to Sobeslav, and willingly interceded for his son;\r\nand Conrad of Moravia was soon compelled to fly before the forces of\r\nhis Imperial namesake. Great part of the next four years was wasted in\r\ncompelling the insurgents to return to their allegiance; but at last\r\nthe Emperor succeeded in making peace between the contending parties,\r\nand Conrad was restored to the government of Moravia.\r\n\r\nVladislav now became eager to resume his interrupted career of reform;\r\nand, as a first step, he began to rebuild the monasteries which the\r\nrebels had destroyed. Like Vratislav, however, he now felt himself\r\nforced by the opposition which he had encountered at home to rely\r\nmore than ever on the German Emperor; and he was thus dragged into\r\nexpeditions which had little concern for Bohemia. At first, indeed,\r\nthe wars in which he engaged were not of a kind to offend the feelings\r\nof his countrymen. The crusade, for instance, in which he followed\r\nConrad in 1147, was too much in accordance with the ideas of the time\r\nto provoke any open opposition from the nobles; while his invasion of\r\nPoland in 1149 was, doubtless, only too popular in Bohemia. But an\r\nexpedition of a far more important character, and far more closely\r\nbound up with the Imperial power, was, a few years later, to occupy the\r\nthoughts of Vladislav and his countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1154 the Emperor Conrad died, and the Electors of the\r\nEmpire met to choose his successor. The influence of the Duke of\r\nBohemia in these elections had now been completely recovered; and\r\nVladislav played a considerable part in securing the success of his\r\ncandidate, the son of Conrad, the celebrated Barbarossa.\r\n\r\nBut Vladislav’s enemies were on the watch to break a connection\r\nso important to his power. Vladislav, for some reason not easy to\r\nascertain, refused to attend Barbarossa’s first Council at Merseburg.\r\nThis absence was at once seized upon by his rival and kinsman Oldr̆ich\r\nto draw the Emperor’s favour away from the new duke. Fortunately,\r\nVladislav, though absent, was well represented by his shrewd adviser,\r\nDaniel, Bishop of Prague; and by the bishop’s influence Oldr̆ich was\r\nquieted for a time. Vladislav took note of this intrigue; and to\r\nprevent its recurrence he drew closer his ties with the Emperor, and\r\nconsented to support the Emperor in a new invasion of Poland.\r\n\r\nThis connection gave Barbarossa the opportunity to interest Vladislav\r\nin his important projects for recovering and making firmer his\r\nposition as Holy Roman Emperor. The rising of Arnold of Brescia had\r\ndrawn the Pope and the Emperor for a time into an alliance; and the\r\nappeal of Lodi against the tyrannies of the greater Lombard towns had\r\ngiven the Emperor a new excuse for establishing his rule in Italy. So\r\nhe became anxious to secure sufficient support from the princes of the\r\nEmpire; and he was ready to grant favours to those most likely to be\r\nof service to him. In 1156 he raised the Margravate of Austria into an\r\nindependent dukedom; and in the following year he proposed to restore\r\nto Vladislav that royal title which had gradually fallen into disuse\r\nin Bohemia, on condition that the new King should bring his forces to\r\nassist him in the siege of Milan.\r\n\r\nThis was the third occasion on which a royal crown had been offered to\r\nthe Dukes of Bohemia; and it was in some ways the most significant of\r\nthe three. The first offer had been made to St. Wenceslaus, and had\r\nbeen based entirely on the ground of his personal qualities. The saint\r\nhad refused it as inconsistent with his character. The offer made to\r\nVratislav had been of a wholly different kind from the first proposal;\r\nbut the way in which the title speedily fell into disuse has led some\r\nto doubt if Henry IV. had intended the crown to be hereditary. In the\r\ncase of Vladislav, however, there was no doubt as to the intentions\r\nof Barbarossa. Indeed, he clearly showed that he considered the grant\r\nof this dignity as the revival of the old Moravian kingship; and, in\r\norder to emphasise the importance and independence of the new dignity,\r\nhe accompanied it by the grant of territory which the Bohemians had\r\npreviously claimed, but over which their rights had hitherto been\r\ndisputed. Although, therefore, the continual contests for the throne of\r\nBohemia, which followed the death of Vladislav, made it impossible for\r\nthe rival pretenders to make good their claim to the royal title, there\r\nwas, nevertheless, no doubt that, from this time forth, any lawfully\r\nelected ruler of Bohemia had the right to call himself king. Yet,\r\nsplendid as this proposal was, Vladislav felt it necessary to consult\r\nhis chief adviser, Bishop Daniel of Prague, before he would give the\r\npromise which could alone secure him the new dignity. Daniel had no\r\ndoubts in his own mind; indeed, he seems throughout to have been more\r\nzealous for the Imperial alliance than Vladislav himself, and even to\r\nhave taken a warm interest in the details of the Italian campaign. He,\r\ntherefore, readily used his influence in favour of the proposal; and\r\nthe bargain between the Emperor and the King was accordingly struck.\r\n\r\nFew wise and well-meaning rulers have ever done greater mischief\r\nto their country than Vladislav accomplished by that hastily made\r\nbargain; but nothing could be honester than his way of carrying out\r\nthe compact; and he clearly showed that he believed himself to be\r\nacting for the good of his country. He hastened back to Bohemia, and\r\ncalled a General Council of the nobles, to whom he announced the\r\nwhole transaction. Immediately fierce protests broke forth. The Duke,\r\nwithout any consultation with his lawful advisers, had raised himself\r\nto a new dignity, and had dragged the country into a foreign war. The\r\nadviser of such unlawful acts deserved to be crucified. This threat\r\nwas obviously aimed at Bishop Daniel, but Vladislav hastened to take\r\nthe whole responsibility upon himself. “I have made this promise,” he\r\nsaid, “to the Emperor, by no man’s advice, but of my own free will. I\r\ngive this answer to the honours which he has granted to me. Whosoever\r\nintends to help me in this business, him I will provide with fitting\r\nhonour and with the money necessary for this work; but he who cares\r\nnot for it let him sit at home content with the games and the ease of\r\nwomen, and secure of the peace which I will guarantee to him.”\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that, under the scornful rhetoric of this speech,\r\nthere is concealed the admission of the important constitutional\r\nprinciple, that the king had no right to demand the service of his\r\nsubjects in a foreign war. In saner moods and at later periods,\r\nBohemians were eager to assert this great liberty. But, for the moment,\r\nthe king’s appeal acted like magic in silencing opposition and rousing\r\nenthusiasm for the war. Songs were composed and speeches delivered in\r\nhonour of the siege of Milan; and, while the young nobility disregarded\r\nthe warnings of their elders and hastened to take up arms in the\r\nImperial cause, the peasants gladly left their wearisome occupations\r\nand oppressed condition to flock to the banner of their beloved king.\r\nThe splendid services accomplished by Vladislav in that ill-fated war\r\nstrengthened his influence in the Councils of the Empire; and it is\r\nat least pleasant to mention that, at the siege of Brescia, the King\r\nof Bohemia used his influence with Barbarossa to soften the terms\r\noffered to the unfortunate Brescians. His personal share in the war\r\nwas indeed cut short, partly by ill-health, partly by the necessity\r\nof returning to Bohemia, which was disturbed by the insurrection of a\r\nnew pretender. But his son Frederick and his brother Theobald brought\r\nnew reinforcements to the camp of Barbarossa; and a large part of all\r\nthe glory that could be won in such a cause was due to the Bohemian\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nNor was Vladislav less successful in rousing the enthusiasm of his\r\nsubjects in favour of another war, which had as little connection as\r\nthe Italian expedition had had with the welfare of Bohemia. Queen\r\nGeysa, of Hungary, appealed to Vladislav in 1164 to help her young son\r\nin his struggle against a pretender to the Hungarian throne. Again\r\nVladislav promised his help, and again the constitutional protest\r\nagainst his promise produced an explanation which served to show\r\nthe deference of the king to the laws, while its complete success\r\nproved his personal popularity in the country. This campaign gave\r\nadditional proof of the king’s military reputation; for the Emperor of\r\nConstantinople, who had invaded Hungary on behalf of the rebels, was\r\neager to make a special peace with his Bohemian opponent; and when he\r\nfailed to effect this purpose, he speedily returned to his own country\r\nand accepted the proposals of Vladislav about the terms of his peace\r\nwith Queen Geysa.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Vladislav stands out strangely in the middle of the\r\ndisorderly twelfth century. We see there a king suppressing disorder\r\nwithout suppressing freedom; armed insurrection by selfish intriguers,\r\nchanging as if by magic into constitutional opposition on behalf of\r\nmost important liberties; and all these gains apparently connected with\r\nan increase in military glory and national prestige, such as might well\r\ndazzle even men of some sagacity and foresight.\r\n\r\nBut the glory, and, what was of far more importance, the peace of\r\nBohemia, were of short duration. The death of Bishop Daniel broke the\r\nchief link between Vladislav and Barbarossa. The bishop had remained\r\nwith the Emperor during his Italian campaign; his counsels had always\r\nbeen welcome, and his influence had, no doubt, been a strong force\r\nin securing Bohemia to the Imperial cause. Nor did his death produce\r\na merely negative effect on the relations between Bohemia and the\r\nEmpire. It brought into play another influence which was exerted on the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nVladislav’s queen, Judith, favoured the party of Pope Alexander III.;\r\nand by her advice a Saxon bishop, who had taken the Papal side, was\r\nelected as Daniel’s successor. As the new bishop was totally ignorant\r\nof the Bohemian language, his election weakened Vladislav’s popularity\r\nwith his people as much as his favour with the Emperor. Three years\r\nlater, the enemies of the king once more found their opportunity to\r\nmake use of these discontents against him. Vladislav, without any\r\nconsultation with the nobles, and without any notice to the Emperor,\r\nresigned his power to his son Frederick; and the intriguers, whom he\r\nhad with such difficulty suppressed, were now easily able to rouse an\r\ninsurrection against his successor. Then followed twenty-five years of\r\nmiserable dynastic squabbles, during which Conrad of Moravia was able\r\nto play the part of king-maker, and, by the help of the puppets whom he\r\nplaced on the throne of Bohemia, to secure a temporary independence for\r\nthe province which he governed.\r\n\r\nAt last the contest was brought to an end by the accession of King\r\nPr̆emysl to the throne in 1198; and he settled the question of Moravian\r\ngovernment by conceding the rule of that province to his brother\r\nVladislav. Pr̆emysl came at the right moment to recover for Bohemia the\r\npower and influence of which the civil wars of a quarter of a century\r\nhad deprived her. Once more, as in the time of Henry IV., Germany’s\r\ndifficulty was Bohemia’s opportunity. The death of Henry VI., the\r\nson of Barbarossa, had thrown the Empire into all the disorder which\r\narises from a disputed succession; and Pr̆emysl found his interest in\r\nplaying off one rival emperor against another, just as the Emperors\r\nhad previously played with the rival candidates to the Bohemian\r\nthrone. Philip and Otto soon found that their respective causes were\r\npractically at the mercy of the Bohemian king; and, if Dubravsky has\r\nany authority for saying that Pr̆emysl’s surname of Ottakar was a\r\ntribute to his devotion to Otto, never, certainly, did a nickname\r\nconvey keener irony.\r\n\r\nNor did the election of Frederick II. diminish the power of Pr̆emysl.\r\nHis influence had considerably contributed to that election; and\r\nFrederick’s lifelong war against popes and priests compelled him to\r\nrely on any friend who would stand by him against those dangerous\r\nantagonists. In his eagerness to secure Pr̆emysl’s help, the Emperor\r\nconfirmed to the Bohemian crown those German territories in Silesia\r\nand the Lausitz, which had so long been the subject of dispute. He\r\nalso granted to Pr̆emysl the power of appointing bishops in Bohemia\r\nwithout any outside interference. Pr̆emysl’s sympathies with Frederick\r\nwere further quickened by the struggles with the clergy of Bohemia in\r\nwhich he found himself involved. The same difficulties which our Henry\r\nII. had so recently experienced, in his attempts to bring the clergy\r\nunder the authority of lay tribunals, were harassing Pr̆emysl during\r\na large part of his reign; and his attitude in these matters provoked\r\nagainst him Papal censures as stern as those which were aimed at his\r\nImperial ally. The contest between king and priest in Bohemia ended in\r\na compromise; but the substantial victory probably remained with the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nPr̆emysl’s vigour tended, no doubt, to reconcile the discontented\r\nnobles to his rule; but, in the reign of his son Wenceslaus, the\r\nopposition again began to make head. Young Pr̆emysl Ottakar, the son\r\nof Wenceslaus, had been appointed Margrave of Moravia; and the power\r\nconnected with this office induced the nobles to make the young prince\r\nthe centre of their intrigues. The terrible events of 1241 suppressed\r\nfaction for a time in Bohemia; for in that year the invasion of Genghis\r\nKhan shook all the States of Europe to their centre, and gradually\r\nforced into the background any minor cause of division. The details of\r\nthis invasion are more properly connected with the events to be dealt\r\nwith in the following chapter. Here it is enough to say that the panic\r\nproduced by this invasion enabled Wenceslaus to rally round him the\r\nwhole forces of the kingdom, and to establish the reputation of Bohemia\r\nas the champion of European civilisation.\r\n\r\nBut there was one ruler, in whom neither fear of danger nor gratitude\r\nfor deliverance could quench his hostility to the Slavonic kingdom.\r\nThis was Frederick of Babenberg, Duke of Austria, who was otherwise\r\nknown as Frederick the Quarrelsome. Ever since the time when Vratislav\r\nhad defeated the Margrave Leopold in his rising against Henry IV., the\r\nrulers of Austria had been doubtful friends to Bohemia; and, though\r\naccident might sometimes have forced them into an alliance, their\r\nordinary attitude was that of suspicion, if not of open hostility.\r\nFrederick the Quarrelsome was one of the bitterest in his opposition.\r\nHe invaded Moravia in the very year after the repulse of the Mongols;\r\nand he continued the struggle till his death.\r\n\r\nThat death, however, instead of bringing peace to Wenceslaus, only\r\nraised against him a far more formidable opponent. The Emperor\r\nFrederick had opposed the efforts of his turbulent namesake; but, when\r\nthe Duke died without an heir, it seemed an excellent opportunity for\r\nseizing Austria as a fief of the Empire. Wenceslaus, on the other hand,\r\ndesired to secure the dukedom for his son Vladislav; and, in spite of\r\nImperial opposition, he seems to have won for his son the sympathies,\r\nof a part, at least, of the Austrian nobles.\r\n\r\nThus then ended abruptly that alliance between Bohemia and the Empire\r\nwhich had been so useful to both parties. Neither Wenceslaus nor\r\nFrederick lost time in their declarations of hostility to each other.\r\nIn 1247 Wenceslaus openly joined in the schemes of Innocent IV., for\r\ndeposing the Emperor, and setting up William of Holland in his place;\r\nand Frederick revenged himself by stirring up the discontented Bohemian\r\nnobles against their king. The struggle was a sharp one; the rebels\r\nsucceeded for a time in deposing Wenceslaus and setting up young\r\nOttakar in his stead; but the threats of Innocent IV. brought them\r\nback to their allegiance; and a compromise by which young Ottakar was\r\nconfirmed in his former government of Moravia removed him from the\r\nranks of his father’s enemies. The death of Frederick II. once more\r\nplunged the Empire into disorder. Wenceslaus saw his opportunity in\r\nthis confusion; and, as Vladislav was now dead, the King persuaded\r\nyoung Ottakar to seize the dukedom of Austria for himself. The\r\nAustrians accepted their new duke without any apparent reluctance;\r\nand thus, when Wenceslaus died in 1253, Ottakar II. became king of a\r\nBohemia, which included not only Silesia and the Lausitz, but also the\r\ndukedom of Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF BOHEMIAN LIFE FROM ACCESSION OF PR̆EMYSL OTTAKAR I. TO\r\nDEATH OF PR̆EMYSL OTTAKAR II.\r\n\r\n(1198-1278.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present century the development of national constitutions\r\nhas had a special interest for historians. This interest has arisen\r\npartly from the spectacle of the unusual number of new experiments\r\nin government which have been made in our own time; partly from the\r\ngrowing sense that the history of wars and Courts has become less\r\nimportant, and that the growth of law and of popular life ought to\r\ntake the place of those exploded subjects of interest. But the exact\r\nlegal position of the different component parts of a nation is not\r\ngenerally easy to ascertain at an early period of its history; nor,\r\nwhen it is ascertained, has the knowledge always brought us nearer to\r\nthe discovery of the really living and progressive force in the nation\r\nat that period.\r\n\r\nThus, in the case of Bohemia, though we get continual hints of national\r\nfeeling and popular aspiration, these do not always centre in legally\r\nconstituted bodies, nor do they keep pace with any orderly line of\r\nconstitutional development. Assemblies seem constantly to have met, but\r\nthese were, in the main, assemblies of nobles; and the general national\r\nfeeling more often took the form of an enthusiasm for the Bohemian\r\nlanguage, or the reverence for a native saint, than of a demand for the\r\nextension of the rights of any class, or for a limitation of the royal\r\npower.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was a natural consequence of this popular indifference to\r\npolitical progress, as compared with the zeal for the preservation of\r\nthe national language, and the religious ritual, that, by the close\r\nof the twelfth century, we find few traces remaining of those free\r\ninstitutions which seemed to connect themselves with the story of\r\nLibus̆a. Even those securities for popular freedom, which undoubtedly\r\nprevailed in historical times, had been, in the course of the eleventh\r\nand twelfth centuries, corrupted into new sources of tyranny. Of these\r\nthe most important had been the Z̆upa, or local assembly. This had been\r\nformed partly for purposes of self-defence, partly for ecclesiastical\r\norganisation; and, though it had centred at one time in a castle, at\r\nanother in a church, yet it had originally been governed by a judge,\r\nelected by the district.\r\n\r\nBut from the time of Boleslav the Cruel, the Dukes began to make it\r\ntheir practice to grant these local judgeships to nobles who had done\r\nthem special service; and those nobles were generally allowed either to\r\nsell their offices or to bequeath them to their heirs. The temptation\r\nto use this position as an instrument of oppression was yet further\r\nincreased by the profit which the judges were allowed to make out of\r\nthe fines that they had inflicted. The money thus accumulated was often\r\nused for the purchase of neighbouring lands; and thus lands formerly\r\nheld by freemen, or on the communal system, passed into the power of\r\nthe official nobles. In the meantime those nobles, who did not become\r\nZ̆upani, were able to profit by the growing unpopularity of the local\r\ntribunals to strengthen the power of their own feudal courts over their\r\ndependants; while the continual wars, and the practice of selling\r\ncaptives into slavery, encouraged the growth of an even more helpless\r\nand degraded class. The coolness with which many of the grants of land\r\ntransfer workmen of various kinds as mere appendages of fields and\r\nfishponds, is in itself a proof of the degraded position to which the\r\npeasant class in Bohemia had been reduced; and the fact that military\r\nservice seemed one of the few means of escaping from serfdom led the\r\npeasants to favour those wars which in the end increased their misery.\r\n\r\nWhen the peculiarly disturbed state of Bohemia, which followed King\r\nVladislav’s retirement from power, had been for a time brought to an\r\nend, or at least modified by the accession of Pr̆emysl Ottakar to the\r\nthrone of the kingdom, it became necessary to provide some remedy for\r\nthe miserable state of things which was destroying the country; and\r\nabove all to find a new opportunity for the development of peaceful\r\ntrade, and some power which could counteract the lawless intrigues of\r\nthe nobles. The calling into life of communities which should be out of\r\nreach of the power both of feudalism and officialism was the natural\r\nmethod of meeting these difficulties; and, in the ruin of the rest of\r\nthe country, there seemed to be two places where there still lingered\r\ntraditions that could be made available for this purpose.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, amid the decay of national freedom, the privileges\r\ngranted to foreigners still remained undiminished; and, stranger\r\nstill, it was from these communities that a new material for national\r\nlife was to be drawn. In the district of Poric̆, which Vratislav had\r\nraised into a suburb of Prague, a settlement of German workmen had\r\nbeen planted by that king; and to encourage them in the continuance of\r\ntheir occupations, he had granted them rights of self-government, which\r\nhad survived the freedom of the Z̆upani, and the other elements of\r\nindependence which had been enjoyed by the poorer classes of Bohemia.\r\nThey had been allowed to choose their own judge without interference\r\nfrom any one; and, except in the cases of the most extreme crimes,\r\nwhich were dealt with by the Duke himself, they were allowed to carry\r\non their own affairs according to their own laws. They were never to\r\nbe compelled to go on military service, except when the actual defence\r\nof the country required it. A Bohemian wishing to bring an action\r\nagainst a German was obliged to prove his case through two German\r\nwitnesses and one Bohemian before a German judge. They were to be safe\r\nfrom that compulsory intrusion into their houses by nobles who came\r\nfrom a distance, which was one of the great burdens of the Bohemian\r\ncitizens; and in many other matters they were allowed to follow the\r\ncustoms of their own country. The respect felt for these privileges\r\nis sufficiently shown by the fact that, even in the time of turbulence\r\nand disorder between the abdication of Vladislav, and the accession of\r\nPr̆emysl, we find a formal confirmation by Duke Sobeslav of Vratislav’s\r\ngrant to the settlers in Poric̆.\r\n\r\nHere then Pr̆emysl could find a tradition which might justify him\r\nin developing, without violent change, liberties of the greatest\r\nimportance to his country; and accordingly in 1213 he grants to the\r\ncitizens of Freudenthal the settlement of their town “in accordance\r\nwith that Teutonic law which has hitherto been unwonted and unused in\r\nthe lands of Bohemia and Moravia; but which, having been granted to\r\nyou first by our illustrious brother Vladislav, Margrave of Moravia,\r\nwe confirm with our royal authority.” And then, as an important hint\r\nof coming developments, and an indication of the thoroughly national\r\npurpose of this movement, he grants them, during the life of himself\r\nand his brother, the tithes on the metals found within four miles from\r\nthe city, to be used for the improvement of the aforesaid city.\r\n\r\nBut, if the new development of town life took root at this time in the\r\nwestern parts of Bohemia, it seems to have had a still earlier growth\r\nin the more eastern province of Moravia. That province had always had\r\npeculiar traditions of its own. It was a fragment of the old kingdom of\r\nMoravia, and had been incorporated in the Bohemian dukedom, at the time\r\nof the Hungarian invasion. It always retained a sense of its important\r\nposition; and Barbarossa himself had increased that feeling when, in\r\ngranting the royal crown to Vladislav, he spoke of the new dignity as a\r\nrevival of the old Moravian kingdom. Moreover, by some means or other,\r\na German element seems to have penetrated into this province; and it\r\nis now generally believed that in Moravia, as in Bohemia, the first\r\ntraditions of municipal self-government were drawn from German sources.\r\nNevertheless, when in 1229 King Pr̆emysl recognised the municipal\r\nliberties of Brünn (Brno), he evidently refers to them as connected\r\nwith local rights which had been traditional for a considerable time\r\nin that town; and in the book of decisions of the Moravian municipal\r\ntribunals, the Law of Brno is sometimes pitted against that Law of\r\nMagdeburg which was generally accepted as the model of town rights.\r\nBrünn, too, became in a peculiar manner the centre of the towns of\r\nMoravia, and its laws became a new source of life to a great portion\r\nof the Bohemian kingdom; and its Book of Rights, with its splendid\r\nbinding and beautiful illuminations, may still be seen in the town\r\ncouncil house at Brünn. So, when in 1229 Pr̆emysl Ottakar confirmed the\r\nancient laws of the province of Brünn, he gave a new, and probably more\r\nattractive, impulse to the movement for civic self-government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RADNICE BRNE: OLD DOOR OF TOWN COUNCIL HOUSE OF BRÜNN.]\r\n\r\nThese rights, however, were of gradual growth, and at the time of\r\nPr̆emysl’s decree they were not developed to that point which the\r\nsubsequent records of their interpretation would lead one to expect.\r\nThus, although we find securities against arbitrary arrest, we do not\r\nfind that definite arrangement for the production of legal witnesses\r\nwhich was afterwards established; and, though the judge is no longer\r\nallowed to decide questions alone, the check upon him seems to be\r\nrather that of officials and nobles than of his fellow-citizens. But,\r\nwhatever defects and limitations we may find in these early provisions\r\nfor municipal liberty, the movement in its favour was soon to be\r\nhastened by one of the most tremendous shocks which had convulsed\r\nEurope since the fall of the Roman Empire. This was nothing less than\r\nthe invasion of Genghis Khan and his Tartar hordes, which has already\r\nbeen slightly alluded to in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Cumani, a still barbarous tribe, had come into\r\ncollision with the Tartars in Asia; and, either flying from Tartar\r\nvengeance, or following a new career of conquest, the Cumani entered\r\nHungary. There they joined with some of their kinsmen who had formerly\r\nsettled there, and began to harass the Hungarians. The Tartars quickly\r\nfollowed on their heels; and, having overrun Russia, they made their\r\nway into Hungary, defeated King Bela, and laid waste his territory,\r\nkilling men, women, and children. From thence they swept over Poland,\r\nand advanced into Moravia, while others attacked Bulgaria and Greece.\r\nThe terror-struck descriptions of the writers of the period seem to\r\ncombine the memories of Gothic and Hunnish invasions with the imagery\r\nof the Apocalypse. Like so many conquerors, Genghis Khan seems to have\r\nhad a conception of a special mission to destroy imposed on him by some\r\ninvisible Power; and he and his followers were looked on, for a time,\r\nas irresistible. He had twelve thousand men wearing breastplates of\r\nskin, and always on horseback, and twenty or thirty horses without any\r\none to guide them following every rider; for the Mongol Tartars could\r\ndo nothing on foot because of their short legs and long bodies. They\r\nwere killing all except those children whom Genghis Khan was branding\r\non the face with his mark. Their women were said to fight on horseback;\r\nand those who slaughtered the most were the most admired.\r\n\r\nWhile Europe was panic-struck, and every man was calling on his\r\nneighbour for help, Pope Gregory IX. and the Emperor Frederick II.\r\nwere fighting with each other for the possession of Sicily; and,\r\nwhile Frederick pleaded that he could not put himself at the head of\r\nthe Imperial forces till Gregory would let him alone, the friends\r\nand admirers of Gregory were accusing Frederick of having himself\r\ninvited in the Tartars; and some even declared that they had seen\r\nhis messengers in the Tartar army. Alone almost among the princes of\r\nEurope, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who had now succeeded to the throne,\r\nseems to have preserved some nerve and sense. He called upon the Duke\r\nof Austria, the Patriarch of Aquileia, the Duke of Carinthia, and the\r\nMargrave of Baden to help him to gather together his forces near Olmütz\r\n(Olomouci); and he made so determined a stand that the invasion was\r\nrolled back upon Hungary.\r\n\r\nEven after this defeat of the Tartars the terror of them hung for years\r\nover Europe; but, though Bohemia itself was not yet free from danger,\r\nWenceslaus, as King of Bohemia, and his son Pr̆emysl Ottakar, as\r\nMargrave of Moravia, now set themselves to redress the injuries done\r\nby the Tartar invasion. In 1243 they began to enlarge and restore the\r\ntowns which had been destroyed by the Tartars; and in order to induce\r\nthe frightened citizens to devote themselves to this work, they found\r\nit necessary to encourage them by the grant of further liberties.\r\n\r\nThe conception of municipal government evidently makes great strides\r\nat this time. Accused persons are now more carefully guarded from\r\narbitrary sentences; and we also find the jury rising to an equality\r\nwith the judge in the decision of certain matters. More clearly,\r\ntoo, do we detect the determination to put a check on the tyranny of\r\nthe nobles by the development of civic liberties. “We will,” says\r\nWenceslaus, in his extension of the privileges of Brünn, “and we\r\nirrefragably decree that no baron or noble of the land shall have power\r\nin the city of Brünn, or shall do any violence in it, or shall detain\r\nany one, without the license and proclamation of the judge of the city;\r\nand we will that, whoever of the citizens has servants or possessions\r\noutside the city, shall not be summoned by the provincial judge, or\r\nthe officials of the province, but shall be judged by the judge of the\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JÍHLAVA (IGLAU), THE GREAT MINING CENTRE IN MORAVIA.]\r\n\r\nThe power of demising property without interference from others,\r\nfreedom of marriage or non-marriage to widows and maidens, various\r\nforms of protection against violence, facilities for holding markets,\r\nand the removal of customs duties--such are the chief subjects dealt\r\nwith in these civic constitutions. The discovery and working of\r\nminerals, which largely date from this time, led to new opportunities\r\nof self-government. In the town of Iglau (Jíhlava), where miners had\r\nbeen prominent in the defence of their country against the Tartars, the\r\npowers granted to them and the neighbouring citizens were particularly\r\nlarge. “We wish and command,” say Wenceslaus and Pr̆emysl Ottakar his\r\nson, “that, whatever the jury of our city and the jury of the miners\r\nhave ordained, for the commercial good, should be inviolably observed\r\nby all.” Even tax-collectors of the king are to consult the miners in\r\ncertain matters; while special securities are given against possible\r\ndefalcations by debtors of noble birth.\r\n\r\nGreat as was the advance which is implied in these decrees, the use\r\nmade of them by the citizens shows that they understood how to extend\r\ntheir liberties still further. The benefit derived from the powers\r\ngranted to civic judges might have been neutralised by the way in which\r\nthe judgeships were still conferred by the kings on their personal\r\nfavourites; but the jurymen of Brünn claimed for themselves the power\r\nof checking, and even overruling the judge, which must have been a far\r\nbetter guarantee for the self-government of the city than any that was\r\ndirectly contained in the royal decree.\r\n\r\n“The judge,” say these administrators, “must reverence the jury as\r\nlegislators, never dictate sentences on his own authority, never arrest\r\nany one without their knowledge, never appropriate to himself the fines\r\nof the city, never bring back those that are driven from the city,\r\nwithout the consent of the jurors; always listen to them, and arrange\r\nall the business of his office according to their advice.”\r\n\r\nHow much the sense of equality before the law grew under this\r\nadministration may be illustrated by the following instance. A servant\r\nhas brought an action against a fellow-servant for wounding him; while\r\nat the same time a master brings an action against the same defendant\r\nfor debt. The question arises which of these shall be heard first.\r\nThe jury decide that “since the body of a man is more precious than\r\nmoney,” the defendant should answer for his violence to the man whom\r\nhe has wounded, before he answers to the master for his debt. More\r\nbold still was the assertion of the rights of the citizens to hold the\r\nnobles responsible to the city tribunals for lands held within the\r\ncity. And while they held their own against the nobles outside, the\r\npopular magistrates increased their authority within the city. The\r\npower of regulating trade, which in England was seized by the Guilds,\r\nwas, in the Moravian towns, at once taken into the hands of the civic\r\nauthorities; and thus those conflicts, which Mrs. Green has described\r\nas prevailing in so many English towns, between the magistrates and the\r\nleaders of the trades, never assume such prominence in the history of\r\nBrünn and Olmütz.\r\n\r\nNor was it only in their immediate security for liberty and good\r\ngovernment that these civic rights were of advantage to Bohemia and\r\nMoravia. Questions were forced upon the practical consideration of\r\nthe jurors, the very discussion of which formed an important element\r\nin political education. Thus the treatment by the jurors of the\r\nquestions of the value of torture, and ordeal by battle, as methods of\r\ndiscovering truth, show how experience was already preparing the way\r\nfor the overthrow of abuses, which were yet too strongly supported by\r\npopular prejudice to be removed at once. The steady growth of these\r\nliberties, which had received so powerful an impulse from the needs\r\nproduced by the Tartar invasion, was still further promoted by Pr̆emysl\r\nOttakar II., and became in his hands part of a complete scheme for\r\nhumbling the power of the nobility.\r\n\r\nWenceslaus, in spite of some fine qualities, had been a self-indulgent\r\nand pleasure-seeking man; and he had, like some of his predecessors,\r\nmortgaged many of the royal lands and castles to the nobles. This had\r\nnaturally increased their power, and had enabled them to organise those\r\ninsurrections against the king in which they had at first succeeded in\r\ninvolving his son. But even while he was still Margrave of Moravia,\r\nyoung Pr̆emysl Ottakar had broken loose from these influences; and\r\nby various economies and convenient pecuniary transactions he had\r\nsucceeded in raising money enough to purchase back the lands from the\r\nnobles, compelling them, sometimes against their will, to surrender\r\ntheir mortgages. He also forced them to break down those castles which\r\nhad been great causes of disorder and weakness in the country. Nor did\r\nhe fail to strengthen his cause by alliance with the clergy.\r\n\r\nEver since the quarrel between Frederick II. and Wenceslaus, that\r\nKing had been a devoted champion of the Pope; and in the growing\r\nweakness of the Empire, the Pope became more and more the one great\r\nPower to which a rising and ambitious king could appeal. Ottakar II.\r\nbecame distinguished as a friend of the Church, not only by his strong\r\nsupport of the Papal power, but by his endowment and development of\r\nthe monasteries. In this, indeed, he was carrying on that revival of\r\nBohemian life which Wenceslaus had begun after the repulse of the\r\nTartars. But it was evident that these ecclesiastical exemptions must\r\nsometimes come into collision with those civic liberties of which we\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\nThis contradiction was evidently felt by Ottakar; and it showed itself\r\nin three different ways. The freedom of trade, which, under certain\r\nlimitations, was so welcome to the towns, was by no means in accordance\r\nwith the claims of the abbots. They wished that certain occupations\r\nshould be carried on under their control; and not that there should be\r\nany exchange of the articles connected with those occupations. Thus we\r\nfind in some of the grants to the monasteries that, while the monks\r\nand their dependants are relieved from certain forms of taxation, the\r\nexemption is specially limited to those who are not engaged in trade.\r\nSecondly, there was an obvious risk of a conflict of authority between\r\nthe monastic tribunals and those of the city. Thirdly, the records of\r\nBrünn, and of its imitators, show that the growing ideas of equality\r\nbefore the law did not always seem to the citizens quite consistent\r\nwith the privileges claimed by the clergy. Nor must it be supposed that\r\ncharters to monasteries and charters to towns represented, in the same\r\ndegree, the ordinary idea of human liberty. The dependants of the abbot\r\nwere as much at his mercy as those of any feudal lord; and though it\r\nmight be an advantage for them to escape from the oppressions of the\r\nZ̆upani, it was not always certain that the abbot would be a gentler\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nThat Ottakar felt the difficulty of this conflict, and desired to\r\ncompromise between the interests of these rivals for his favour, is\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the two cases of Hradiste and Litomys̆l. In\r\nthe former case, Ottakar was particularly anxious to secure the good\r\nwill of the citizens, because he looked upon their town as a possible\r\nbulwark against Hungarian invasion; but the neighbouring convent\r\nof Vilegrad feared that the grant of liberties to Hradiste would\r\ninterfere with the privileges of their convent. The compromise to which\r\nOttakar was forced seems a considerable surrender to ecclesiastical\r\npretensions. The townsmen were to settle in one particular island, for\r\nwhich they were to pay rent to the monastery. The monastery was to\r\nretain all its former rights over waters, fisheries, mills, meadows,\r\nwoods, and corn-fields; and, though the town was to hold a market two\r\ndays a week, the profit of that market was to go on one day to the\r\nking, and on another to the monastery; and, above all, the judge of the\r\ntown was to be appointed by the monastery. But in this decree there is\r\na provision which seems to suggest how even such a compromise might\r\nwork for freedom. The common rights in pasture held previously by the\r\ntownsmen are to be shared with the dependants of the monastery; but\r\nthe dependants of the monastery in their turn are to share their common\r\nrights with the citizens of the town. Thus there would naturally grow\r\nup a combination among the dependants of the monasteries, like those\r\nunions which, in England, gave such trouble to the abbots of St. Albans\r\nand Dunstable.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Litomys̆l the grants to the monastery and those given to\r\nthe town are so entangled that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish\r\nbetween the benefits received by the respective recipients of the\r\nroyal favour; and, in this case, Ottakar seems to have cut the knot by\r\nraising Litomys̆l to the ordinary position of a royal town, and thereby\r\nemancipating it from the control of the monastery. Ottakar indeed had\r\none sure protection against any possible offence which the Church\r\nmight fear from the growth of civic liberty. Bruno, Bishop of Olmütz,\r\nwas his right-hand man in this as in other parts of his work. Himself\r\na German by birth, he warmly encouraged the introduction of German\r\ntown rights into the cities of Moravia; while, on the other hand, he\r\nalways succeeded, until the final catastrophe of Ottakar’s life, in\r\nstrengthening the good understanding between the Pope and the King of\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\nThus there were now growing up in Bohemia the elements of internal\r\nliberty, under the patronage of a king strong and wise enough to hold\r\nhis own against the nobles. Had Ottakar been content to remain King\r\nof Bohemia alone, the effect of his reign on his country might have\r\nbeen permanently beneficial. But it is now necessary to speak of that\r\ncareer of conquest and aggression which raised up against him so many\r\nenemies, and which at last put into the hands of his most dangerous\r\nrival the weapon by which king and country were alike overthrown.\r\n\r\nHowever evil were the final results of his aggressions, it must be\r\nowned that there was a certain plausibility in the justification\r\noffered by Ottakar for each of his conquests. To begin with the first\r\nand most important of them, the conquest of Austria. The Babenbergers\r\nhad been undoubtedly troublesome neighbours to the Dukes of Bohemia;\r\nand Frederick the Quarrelsome, the last of the line, had been also so\r\noppressive to his subjects that they had appealed to the Emperor to\r\nchoose them a new duke. On this occasion the King of Bohemia had been\r\none of those to whom the enforcement of the ban of the Empire had been\r\nentrusted. When, then, on the death of Frederick the Quarrelsome, the\r\nland seemed likely to fall into the hands of the Emperor, or to be torn\r\nin pieces by rival claimants, Wenceslaus and Ottakar may have naturally\r\nconsidered it a matter of self-defence to establish their rule, and\r\nwith it some kind of order, in the lands of so near a neighbour; and\r\nthey were further encouraged in their attempt by the approval of Pope\r\nInnocent IV.\r\n\r\nBut the latter phases of the conquest are perhaps less excusable, and\r\neven somewhat discreditable to Wenceslaus and his son. The Austrian\r\nnobles, on the death of the Emperor Frederick had resolved to choose\r\nthe Margrave of Meissen as their duke, and to send representatives to\r\ninvite him to accept the ducal crown. On their way through Bohemia,\r\nWenceslaus invited them to a banquet, and tried to cajole them into\r\nchoosing his son as their duke. The messengers, alarmed and taken by\r\nsurprise, declared that they had no authority to accept this proposal.\r\nWenceslaus, thereupon, uttered such threats, that the Austrians\r\nconsidered it dangerous to continue their journey; and they returned to\r\ntheir country to reconsider the question.\r\n\r\nApart from the claim given to the Margrave of Meissen by the choice of\r\nthe nobles, there were two rival claimants to the dukedom of Austria;\r\nMargaret the widow of the Emperor Henry VI., and daughter of Leopold\r\nthe Glorious, the most popular of all the Babenberg House; and Gertrude\r\na niece of Frederick the Quarrelsome, and wife of the Margrave of\r\nBaden. Margaret was, of course, tolerably advanced in life, and had\r\ntaken a vow of virginity after the death of her husband; but Wenceslaus\r\nand Bruno of Olmütz persuaded young Ottakar to make good his claim to\r\nthe duchy by wooing the widow. In an evil hour for herself, Margaret\r\nconsented to Ottakar’s proposal; the approval of the Pope, and possibly\r\nsome slight display of military force, completed Ottakar’s claim; and\r\nhe was accepted by some at least of the Austrian nobles as their Duke.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, as in Bohemia, Ottakar looked chiefly for his support to\r\nthe great cities. Vienna flourished under his rule; and he granted\r\nspecial privileges to the neighbouring town of Neustadt. But the\r\nhostility of the nobles still continued; and they were resolved that,\r\nat all events, the German province of Styria should not fall into\r\nBohemian hands. The difficulty of Ottakar’s position on this question\r\nlay in the fact that the most important rival claimant was Bela, King\r\nof Hungary, who, like Ottakar, was a special favourite of the Pope;\r\nand in the beginning of the struggle the King of Hungary succeeded\r\nin establishing his authority in Styria. But, by the admission even\r\nof Ottakar’s enemies, the tyranny of the Hungarians in Styria was so\r\ngreat that, when Ottakar again made an attempt on the province, he was\r\nwelcomed as a deliverer; and for the time he made good his footing.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to get a formal sanction for these conquests; and\r\nOttakar chose Richard of Cornwall, from the rival claimants to the\r\nGerman Empire, as the puppet most useful for this purpose. Richard was\r\nwilling enough to secure so influential a supporter; but the King of\r\nHungary was not so easily satisfied. In 1260, he once more poured his\r\nforces into Styria and Austria; and he was now followed, not only by\r\nthe Hungarian troops, but by the savage Cumanians, and even, according\r\nto one account, by the Tartars. The struggle was a fierce one; but it\r\nended in the complete victory of the Bohemians.\r\n\r\nOttakar, however, thought it necessary to secure himself against future\r\ninvasions, by a singularly questionable step. The unfortunate Margaret,\r\nto whom, it was evident, he must very soon have become unfaithful,\r\nwas to be repudiated on the ground of her former vow of virginity, in\r\norder that Ottakar might marry Kunigunda, the daughter of Bela, King\r\nof Hungary. Urban IV., like many of his predecessors, was extremely\r\ndesirous to procure a good understanding between Hungary and Bohemia,\r\nas in the union of these kingdoms he saw the best hope of security\r\nagainst a future Tartar invasion; so Kunigunda was crowned Queen of\r\nBohemia by the Archbishop of Mainz.\r\n\r\nBut Ottakar’s conquests were not yet at an end. Ulrich, the Duke\r\nof Carinthia and Carniola, had a very troublesome brother called\r\nPhilip, who was generally at feud with some prince or other. Amongst\r\nhis other enemies was the Patriarch of Aquileia, to whose office he\r\ndesired to succeed. Ulrich, knowing Ottakar’s influence with the\r\nPope and the ecclesiastics generally, tried to secure that influence\r\nin favour of the election of Philip to the patriarchate. Ottakar\r\nagreed, on condition that Ulrich would make him his heir in Carinthia\r\nand Carniola. Ulrich consented to this proposal; and, by Ottakar’s\r\ninfluence, the Chapter of Aquileia elected Philip Patriarch. Philip\r\nwas apparently unaware of the bargain; and he was therefore extremely\r\nindignant, when, on Ulrich’s death, the King of Bohemia entered\r\nCarinthia and Carniola as the lawful heir of Ulrich. This bitterness\r\nwas further increased when the Pope refused to confirm the election of\r\nthe Chapter, and Philip found himself without either patriarchate or\r\ndukedom.\r\n\r\nOttakar was now the lord of all the territories which form the western\r\npart of the present Austrian Empire, with the exception of the Tyrol.\r\nBut his hold on these conquered territories was by no means so certain\r\nas it at first appeared. Though none of his rivals were able, at the\r\nmoment, to make good their claims against him, yet any one of them\r\nmight reckon on a formidable amount of discontent in all the conquered\r\nprovinces. For the same policy which he had pursued in Bohemia of\r\nbreaking down the power of the nobles, by destroying their castles, was\r\ncarried on in his new dominions; and, while in all of them it caused\r\nconsiderable opposition, in Styria the discontent soon ripened into\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Styrian nobles had, from the first, been one of\r\nmore determined hostility than Ottakar had encountered in his other\r\ndominions; and it soon provoked him into measures which increased the\r\nevil. One can scarcely accept as undoubted history all the charges of\r\ncruelty made against him by the Styrian noble Ottakar von Horneck,\r\nwho was evidently in full sympathy from the first with those who\r\nresisted the Bohemian claims. Still less can we accept as authentic the\r\nreckless attacks of the chronicler Victor, who was a chaplain of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg. But those facts, which seem to be indisputable, are\r\nsufficient of themselves to account for Ottakar’s failure to reduce the\r\nprovince to submission. As usual in such cases, intriguers were found\r\nto intensify the king’s suspicions by false accusations; some nobles\r\nwere thrown into prison on insufficient evidence; and when the case\r\nbroke down against them, their accuser was in turn imprisoned. Finally,\r\nMilota, the governor appointed by Ottakar, tried to bring in Bohemian\r\nsoldiers and Bohemian settlers to maintain the authority of the king.\r\n\r\nBut, though all these elements of discontent were gradually ripening\r\nto violent conclusions, to outward appearance Ottakar was still at the\r\nheight of his power. Old King Bela of Hungary, in dying, placed his\r\nwife, daughter, and barons under the special protection of Ottakar;\r\nand, when Bela’s son and successor Stephen tried to shake off the power\r\nwhich his father had given to Bohemia, he found himself opposed by the\r\nbishops and archbishops of Hungary, and by some even of the barons.\r\nOttakar was able to dictate peace in Hungary itself, and Stephen was\r\nforced to renounce all claims to Styria and Carinthia.\r\n\r\nA change, however, was shortly to occur in Europe which was to diminish\r\none of the chief causes of Ottakar’s success. In his, as in former\r\nreigns, Germany’s difficulty had been Bohemia’s opportunity; and it\r\nwas Ottakar’s too ready recognition of this fact which now brought him\r\ninto collision with the wisest and most patriotic rulers in Europe,\r\nas well as with some of the most daring intriguers. Ever since the\r\ndeath of Henry VI., the son of Barbarossa, the claim to the throne of\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire had been perpetually disputed. The striking and\r\nromantic figure of Frederick II. had indeed arrested the attention of\r\nEurope in a marked manner; but the intense hatred felt for him by all\r\nthe Popes, his own preference of Sicily to Germany, and the complete\r\ndisorganisation produced by the Tartar invasion, had combined to\r\nprevent him from establishing any firm rule in the Empire. Since his\r\ndeath the phantom figures of William of Holland, Conrad the Fourth,\r\nAlfonso of Castille, and Richard of Cornwall had flitted across the\r\nstage of German politics, each contributing a certain amount of\r\nincrease to the general anarchy. In the absence of any settled central\r\ngovernment, the great towns of Germany had endeavoured to form leagues\r\nfor their own protection, and in the general interest of order; but\r\neven these had a difficulty in maintaining their existence against the\r\npretensions of the archbishops and the robberies of the knights and\r\nnobles.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of things the first instinct of those who desired to\r\nrestore order was to choose the strongest ruler who could be found; and\r\ntherefore it was not altogether surprising that the Imperial crown was\r\noffered, by some at least of the German princes, to Ottakar himself.\r\nThe grounds of Ottakar’s refusal have been variously given; and it is\r\nhighly probable that both of the explanations offered were parts of the\r\ntruth. On the one hand his nobles, already jealous of his power, were\r\nextremely unwilling that he should have a new and independent force at\r\nhis back, which would enable him still further to overawe them; while,\r\non the other hand, Ottakar himself saw clearly that the position of\r\nKing of Bohemia and King-maker of the Empire was a far safer and more\r\npowerful one than the position of a Holy Roman Emperor, checked, and\r\noften controlled, by the Electors of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe Elector who took the most prominent part in this offer to Ottakar\r\nhad been the Archbishop of Köln; but Werner of Mainz now succeeded in\r\ninducing the Archbishops of Köln and Trier to join him in an alliance\r\nwhich was to secure the election of an Emperor who would be amenable\r\nto their advice. Werner had been specially alarmed at the growth of\r\nOttakar’s power; for any development of Bohemian independence would\r\nweaken the power of the Empire over the diocese of Prague, and would\r\nthereby weaken also the ecclesiastical authority of Mainz. He was,\r\ntherefore, specially anxious to secure a counterbalancing power to\r\nOttakar’s, but a power which would at the same time be dependent on\r\nthe Electors of the Empire. The Archbishops first considered, and\r\nthen rejected, the proposal to raise to the Imperial throne the Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine; for they soon saw that he might be useful as an\r\nally, but extremely dangerous as a master. As the great hindrance to\r\nthe unity of the Empire seemed, at that time, to come from the South,\r\nit was particularly necessary for the Archbishops to win to their\r\nside Duke Louis of Bavaria, who was the principal rival and enemy of\r\nOttakar. Bavaria had recently been divided into two parts, between the\r\ntwo brothers Louis and Henry; and the warm friendship of Henry for\r\nOttakar had strengthened the opposition of Louis. Louis, indeed, may\r\nhave himself dreamt of the Imperial crown; but neither the Archbishops,\r\nnor the more northern Electors, were disposed to concede this dignity\r\nto him. They had, however, a bait which was sufficiently attractive to\r\nthe Duke.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that in the year 1257, the Duke of Bavaria had taken part\r\nin one of those confused elections to the Empire which had given an\r\nopportunity for every kind of irregular interference. The Archbishops\r\nnow proposed to recognise this precedent as conferring on the Duke of\r\nBavaria the position of Elector of the Empire, and thus completing\r\nthe mystic number of seven, without the help of the King of Bohemia. A\r\ncandidate for the throne had, however, still to be found; and, as the\r\nidea of choosing one of the more powerful princes was now definitely\r\nabandoned, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony put\r\nforward a kinsman of their own, named Siegfried of Anhalt.\r\n\r\nThe majority, however, of the Electors, and the most active spirits\r\namong them, desired to strengthen their position in the South\r\nrather than the North of Germany; and it was now that Frederick of\r\nHohenzollern, the Burggraf of Nürnberg, brought forward the candidate\r\nfor whom he had been secretly preparing the way. This was Count Rudolf\r\nof Hapsburg, the owner of a castle near the Lake of Constance, who had\r\nbecome known in his own neighbourhood as the protector and champion of\r\nBern and other growing towns. He had gained considerable reputation\r\nfor military ability; and he had evidently some of that personal power\r\nof fascination so important to a great ruler. Fortunately for his\r\nchances of success he had already attracted the attention of Werner of\r\nMainz, at the time when the Archbishop was on his journey to Rome to be\r\nconfirmed in his diocese. But, besides this important support, Rudolf\r\nhad another source of influence, the peculiar use of which was to be\r\na marked characteristic of his descendants. He had a large number of\r\nmarriageable daughters. One of these was promised to the Count Palatine\r\nof the Rhine; and by marriage with another the Duke of Saxony was\r\npersuaded to abandon the cause of Siegfried of Anhalt. By what means\r\nthe Elector of Brandenburg was won over is not quite clear; and, in\r\nall probability, he was the least willing of the Imperial Electors to\r\ngrant his support to Rudolf. His opposition, however, cannot at this\r\ntime have been very decided; for, when the Electors held their formal\r\nmeeting, the resolution to support Rudolf was unanimous.\r\n\r\nThus far the intrigues appear by some mysterious means to have been\r\nkept from the knowledge of Ottakar. But such an arrangement could not\r\nlong be hid. Henry of Bavaria must necessarily have been admitted to\r\nthe knowledge of some of these proceedings; and, although the Electors\r\nwere anxious to conciliate him, he was not yet prepared to abandon his\r\nfriendship for Ottakar. Probably, therefore, it was through his means\r\nthat Ottakar had received notice of the meeting of the final Assembly\r\nfor deciding the election; and he was able, therefore, to send a\r\nrepresentative to it. Apparently, however, the King of Bohemia had not\r\neven yet realised the full extent of his enemies’ intrigues; and it\r\nwas with the greatest surprise and indignation that his representative\r\ndiscovered that the meeting to which he had been summoned was merely\r\ncalled to confirm an election already previously agreed upon. That\r\nOttakar should be indignant at this ignoring of his electoral rights\r\nwas natural enough; but the amazement and horror which the election of\r\nRudolf excited in his mind can only be described in his own words.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1273, he addressed to Pope Gregory X., who had then been\r\nrecently elected, his protest against the decision of the Electoral\r\nCollege. Beginning with a most glowing and somewhat fulsome description\r\nof the Papacy, he then proceeds as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, if the commonwealth is ever oppressed, neither reason nor\r\nour wishes allow us to have recourse to any but you. Whence, since\r\nthe Princes of Germany who have the power of choosing the Cæsars have\r\nagreed (we would not speak with spiteful poison, nor has detraction\r\na place in a royal speech) to direct their votes to a less suitable\r\nCount, in spite of the protest of our customary messengers whom we sent\r\nto Wrauenwrt, where the election ought to have been held; and since, to\r\nthe injury of the Empire and to our prejudice, after our appeal to the\r\nApostolic Chair, they have decorated him with the majesty of the sacred\r\ndiadem, we return to you as the inexhaustible fountain of justice and\r\npiety, entreating your Holiness not to permit us to be trampled on in\r\nour rights, which the aforesaid princes try to crush down with manifest\r\ninjuries; and that you will deign to turn your sacred mind to the\r\nweeping state of the Empire; and that the blessed benignity of Mother\r\nChurch will take compassion on it; since that Empire, before which\r\nthe whole world has trembled, which was entrusted with all the most\r\nexcellent dignities of monarchy, has now fallen to those persons whom\r\nobscurity hides from fame, who are deprived of power and strength, and\r\nweighed down by the burden of poverty. Pity us! holiest Father! lest\r\n_that_ which is so pressed down may be seen to be most unworthy; since,\r\nif the Apostolic Chair permits it, if the world tolerates it, that so\r\nhigh an exaltation should be granted to those that are low, it would be\r\nreduced to nothing; and _that_ which the Arab has served, the Indian\r\nhas obeyed, the Italian has submitted to, the Spaniard has looked up\r\nto, which the whole world has reverenced, should become despicable in\r\nthe eyes of all. Him whom the Senate and Roman people, whom law and\r\nvirtue, whom God Himself has established on the throne, every one will\r\ndespise as scorning the bridle of a poor man. And thus justice will\r\nbe stifled, concord will be banished, peace will perish in a reign of\r\ncrimes, injuries will flourish unpunished, neighbour will rise against\r\nneighbour, and such calamity and misery will hang over us that all who\r\nlive will hate their life.”\r\n\r\nSurely a more pathetic appeal was rarely addressed by a great ruler\r\nto the head of the Christian Church. But Gregory X., though willing\r\nlike his predecessors to be on good terms with the King of Bohemia,\r\nwas probably not so ill-informed of the affairs of Europe as not to\r\nknow that many of the evils which Ottakar depicted as likely to follow\r\non Rudolf’s election, had already disturbed the Empire for many years\r\npast; and he was soon to be convinced that the election of Rudolf might\r\nbe the best way of removing them. Rudolf, on his part, lost no time and\r\nspared no pains in destroying in the Pope’s mind the only objection\r\nwhich might possibly have interfered with his acceptance. While eager\r\nto secure his recognition and coronation as Holy Roman Emperor by the\r\nPope, Rudolf, more than any Emperor since Henry the Fowler, desired to\r\nbe, in all essentials, merely a German King. He eagerly assured the\r\nPope that he had not the slightest wish to assert those claims in\r\nItaly and Sicily which had brought Frederick II. and other emperors\r\ninto collision with the Papacy; nay, he would even defend the nominees\r\nof the Pope in their claims on Sicily, and would in all things be the\r\nfaithful servant of the Church. But, though Gregory very soon showed\r\nan inclination to accept the choice of the German Electors, he still\r\npaused on the brink of so important a decision; and this pause was\r\ningeniously used by the ablest of Ottakar’s advisers, Bruno, Bishop of\r\nOlmütz. Gregory, who seems to have been one of the most high-minded\r\nPopes of the period, was sincerely desirous of restoring a better state\r\nof things in Europe, partly as a preparation for a new expedition to\r\nPalestine. In order to ascertain the real feeling and purposes of the\r\nChristians of Europe, he requested various bishops to report to him\r\non the condition of the countries with which they were acquainted.\r\nWhatever other results this appeal may have produced, Bruno saw in\r\nit an admirable opportunity for furthering his master’s interests.\r\nThe growth of heresy, the maintenance of the Cumani by the King of\r\nHungary, the extreme poverty and misery of the clergy, the indifference\r\nof the bulk of the people to religious services, the intrusion of\r\nthe mendicant friars into the offices of the parochial clergy and\r\nbishops, the unwillingness of the laity to hear their sins denounced,\r\nand the continual encroachment of lay judges on the privileges of the\r\nclergy--all these evils are aggravated by the elevation to high places\r\nof those who ought rather to be subjects. The only trustworthy champion\r\nof the Christian faith is the King of Bohemia; even in the very\r\ndiocese of Prague he is the only patron who grants the presentation\r\nof the clergy to the bishops; and on him mainly will fall the burden\r\nof resisting a new Tartar invasion. Bruno undoubtedly stood high in\r\nthe opinion of Gregory; and, even apart from his advice, there were\r\nobvious grounds for inquiry in the circumstances of Rudolf’s election.\r\nA Council was therefore held at Lyons for the full investigation of\r\nthis question; an unusually large number of bishops attended it; and\r\nit doubtless received dignity in the eyes of many by the presence of\r\nThomas Aquinas and Bonaventura. Bruno’s protest was heard at full;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, Rudolf’s readiness to meet the demands of\r\nthe Pope, and to acknowledge the rights of the clergy was pressed upon\r\nGregory’s attention. Anxious to treat Ottakar mildly, but conscious\r\nthat the Church and the Empire would both gain by the election of\r\nRudolf, Gregory decided that, though Ottakar’s claim to share in the\r\nelection was undoubtedly just, yet, as the six other Electors took\r\nthe opposite side to that which he advocated, he was in the minority,\r\nand ought therefore to yield; and the Pope persuaded Bruno to use his\r\ninfluence with his master in favour of Rudolf.\r\n\r\nBut the question, in the meantime, was assuming a new aspect. Rudolf’s\r\nalarm at the opposition of Ottakar, and his desire to secure all the\r\nImperial rights, were combining with other circumstances to induce\r\nhim to put forward a claim for the restoration to the Empire of the\r\nDuchies of Austria, Styria, Carniola, and Carinthia. Ottakar had been\r\nunwilling to resist the pressure of the Pope and the advice of Bruno;\r\nbut he now demanded that, before doing homage to Rudolf, he should have\r\na clear guarantee for the possession of the lands that he had conquered.\r\n\r\nIn his determination to resist the demands of Rudolf, Ottakar seems to\r\nhave been strangely unaware of the dangers that were surrounding him.\r\nRudolf was, in the meantime, making allies with great sagacity. Count\r\nMeinhard of the Tyrol had been the Count of Hapsburg’s most intimate\r\nfriend; and he was one of the many who looked with jealous eyes on\r\nOttakar’s possession of Carinthia. The Archbishop of Salzburg had\r\nclaimed some rights in Styria, and was besides continually harassed by\r\nencroachments on the part of Ottakar; Henry of Bavaria had been one\r\nof those to whom the nobles of Styria had offered their dukedom; and\r\nthough his friendship for Ottakar shows that he must have abandoned\r\nthis claim for a time, the offer of one of Rudolf’s useful daughters\r\nfinally detached him from his alliance with Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the indefatigable Burggraf of Nürnberg had discovered\r\nand fomented the discontents of the nobles of Austria and Styria; and\r\nhe announced to Ottakar that the Ban of the Empire had been proclaimed\r\nagainst him. But even now Ottakar was unaware of Rudolf’s plans; he\r\nprobably despised his military ability; and he thought it sufficient\r\nto send a small force to the defence of the Bohemian frontier, while\r\nhe gave himself up to hunting and other amusements. He was, therefore,\r\nterribly startled when, in September, 1276, Rudolf suddenly entered\r\nAustria. Almost at the same time Count Meinhard invaded Carinthia, and\r\nthe Styrian nobles, rising in insurrection, drove out Milota from their\r\ncountry. Still Ottakar hoped to save himself by the devotion of the\r\ntowns; for six months, Vienna justified his expectations by holding\r\nout against Rudolf’s army; and Paltram, the Burgomaster, roused the\r\ncitizens to a vigorous defence on behalf of the King, who had showed\r\nthem such favour. Ottakar, now stirred to action, marched into Austria\r\nand occupied one side of the Danube; from whence he hoped to make an\r\nattack on the rear of Rudolf’s army. But the Count Palatine of the\r\nRhine hastened to seize the fortresses which lay between him and the\r\nGerman army; and it was now that Ottakar became thoroughly aware of\r\nthe defection of his nobles. Fortress after fortress surrendered to\r\nRudolf without a struggle; and at last the poorer men in Vienna, seeing\r\nthe continual destruction of their vineyards outside the city, called\r\nupon Paltram to surrender. He, finding that Ottakar did not arrive,\r\ndespaired of holding out longer; though, before surrendering, he\r\nexacted from Rudolf a promise that he would maintain the liberties of\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Bruno of Olmütz heard of this loss, he advised Ottakar\r\nto yield. Ottakar was most reluctant that the struggle should end\r\nwithout a pitched battle; but another enemy now threatened to appear\r\non the scene. Ladislaus, the new king of Hungary, was smarting under\r\nthe recollection of the defeats which his predecessor had sustained;\r\nand he prepared to invade Bohemia. This new danger seems to have\r\ndecided Ottakar to yield. He therefore publicly surrendered to Rudolf\r\nall his claims on Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, and did\r\nhomage to him as Emperor for his kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nSuch a settlement could not possibly be lasting. Ottakar had not yet\r\nbeen defeated in any pitched battle; his wife Kunigunda is said to\r\nhave reproached him for his weakness in yielding so soon; and, in\r\nthe carrying out of the treaty which followed, numerous questions,\r\nof doubtful interpretation, quickly came to the front. In this case,\r\none of Rudolf’s otherwise successful daughters proved a source of\r\ncontention rather than of unity. Guta, the daughter whom Rudolf had\r\noffered as a bride to Ottakar’s son, had been promised large lands as\r\nher dowry; and Ottakar maintained that, as these lands must necessarily\r\nlie in Austria, he was not bound to evacuate those territories, but\r\nshould rather claim them as his due. Rudolf, on the other hand,\r\ninsisted that the terms of the treaty involved the evacuation of the\r\nwhole of Austria.\r\n\r\nA question which must have touched Ottakar far more nearly was the\r\ninterpretation of the clause about the extension to the supporters of\r\neach King of all the securities gained by the peace. The discontent\r\nof the nobles with Ottakar’s rule had extended even to Bohemia and\r\nMoravia; and many of the king’s native subjects had entered into\r\nintrigues with Rudolf. Rudolf maintained that, as these men must be\r\nconsidered his supporters, they were entitled to the same concessions\r\nas the other champions of his cause. It was obvious that such grounds\r\nof division as these, by whatever compromise they might be settled\r\nat the moment, must leave a lasting sting behind them; and there is\r\nno sign in the letters of either King of even such a pretence of\r\nfriendship, as the ordinary exigencies of diplomacy might seem to\r\nrequire. Both Rudolf and Ottakar were, in fact, preparing for a new\r\nstruggle, and looking about for allies.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the chances seemed to be in favour of Ottakar. In the\r\nfirst struggle he could rely on nothing but the military forces of his\r\nown kingdom, and the sympathies of those citizens whom he had favoured;\r\nwhile Rudolf was backed by the approval and encouragement of the great\r\nprinces of the Empire, by the sanction of the Pope, by the assistance\r\nof the King of Hungary, and by the eager sympathy and co-operation of\r\nthe discontented subjects of Ottakar.\r\n\r\nNow, these supporters seemed to be gradually dropping off from the\r\nEmperor. Rudolf had by no means abandoned that championship of the\r\ntowns for which he had been so distinguished before his election to the\r\nImperial throne; and of all the enemies of the town life of Germany the\r\nprince-bishops were looked upon as the most determined and dangerous.\r\nRudolf had therefore to choose between adherence to his old policy\r\nand the favour of his archiepiscopal supporters. With a courage which\r\nwas doubtless united to far-sighted wisdom, he boldly defended the\r\nmunicipal rights of Köln against the encroachments of its Archbishop.\r\nThat powerful Elector was thus completely alienated from Rudolf’s\r\ncause; and he speedily succeeded in persuading his brother Archbishops\r\nof Trier and Mainz to desert their nominee. The defection of Werner of\r\nMainz so alarmed Rudolf that he seemed disposed to make some sacrifice\r\nof principle in order to conciliate him. But the concessions which\r\nthe Emperor offered were not sufficient to appease the jealousies and\r\nsuspicions of the Archbishop; and Werner now began to listen only too\r\nreadily to the advances of Ottakar.\r\n\r\nThe Margrave of Brandenburg can never have been a warm supporter of\r\nRudolf. He had married Ottakar’s sister; and he was united to him\r\nalso by the still closer link of military comradeship; for Ottakar\r\nand he had fought side by side in one of those invasions of Prussia,\r\nwhich were supposed to be so advantageous to the souls of the heathen\r\npopulation, and which undoubtedly tended to increase the power and\r\nterritory of the Margrave of Brandenburg. Nor does the Duke of Saxony\r\nseem to have been finally secured to the interest of Rudolf by the\r\nmarriage with his daughter. Even the Dukes of Bavaria did not feel that\r\nthey had profited as much as they had hoped to do by their support\r\nof the Emperor; and they were not a little alarmed at his evident\r\nintention to turn the provinces, which he had won for the Empire, into\r\na private possession of the House of Hapsburg. Nor was Rudolf more\r\nfortunate when he tried to find allies abroad whose support might\r\ncompensate him for the loss of his friends at home. In vain he made\r\nadvances to our Edward I.; and an attempt to strengthen his hands by\r\nalliances with the princes of Italy, had the sole result of exciting\r\nthe suspicions and enmity of Pope Nicholas III.\r\n\r\nOttakar was, of course, greatly encouraged by these secessions from\r\nhis rival; and he hoped still further to strengthen his own position\r\nby detaching the King of Hungary from his alliance with Rudolf, and by\r\nstirring up an insurrection in Austria. In both these efforts, however,\r\nhe was unsuccessful. The conspiracy formed by some of the Austrian\r\nnobles, in concert with the still discontented Burgomaster of Vienna,\r\nwas detected by Rudolf before it had come to a head; and while Paltram\r\nwas forced to save himself by flight, one of the leading nobles was\r\nseized and condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this conspiracy seems to have been the signal for the\r\nnew outbreak of war; and it was now apparent that Rudolf had not been\r\nwholly weakened by the desertion of his powerful supporters. The forces\r\non which he could still rely were more ready to act under his command\r\nthan the great princes of the Empire would have been; and his one\r\nindependent ally probably gave him more efficient help than he could\r\nhave derived from any distant general. This was Ladislaus of Hungary,\r\nwho had been firmly secured to Rudolf’s side, partly by the gift of one\r\nof his inexhaustible tribe of daughters, and partly by a vague promise\r\nof extension of territory. Ottakar was apparently unaware of the\r\nfirmness of this alliance; and he entered Austria with a somewhat small\r\nforce, expecting an easy victory. One or two fortresses fell quickly\r\ninto his hands; but the sudden appearance of the King of Hungary at\r\nthe head of a large army took him completely by surprise; and, after\r\nsuffering a slight defeat, he found it convenient to retreat to some\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nRudolf in the meantime had rallied round him his most determined\r\nsupporters. Chief among these was Frederick of Hohenzollern; and the\r\nEmperor also received ready help from Count Meinhard of the Tyrol,\r\nthe Archbishop of Salzburg, and the Bishop of Basel. Besides these\r\nsupporters, he had under his command a strong force of South Germans;\r\nwhile fiercest and keenest of all the soldiers in his ranks were those\r\nwho fought under the banners of the discontented Styrian nobles.\r\n\r\nThe rival armies met on the banks of the river Morava on the plain\r\ncalled the Marchfeld. The battle was a fierce one. The Bishop of Basel\r\nand Frederick of Hohenzollern broke the left wing of the Bohemian army;\r\nwhile, on the other side, Ottakar, at the head of a chosen band of\r\nknights, drove back the right wing of the Imperialists, and even struck\r\ndown the Emperor himself. But the Styrian nobles so fiercely resisted\r\nthe advance of the Bohemians, that they gave time to Rudolf to reform\r\nhis troops; while Frederick of Hohenzollern followed up his success by\r\nattacking the reserve guard, which ought to have advanced to Ottakar’s\r\nrescue. These reserves were headed by Milota, Ottakar’s Governor of\r\nStyria. It is said that Milota himself had a bitter grievance against\r\nthe king, on account of an injury inflicted on his brother. Whether\r\nthis is true or not, it seems certain that, just when these troops\r\nought to have hastened to the support of the main army, they were\r\nsuddenly seized with a panic, and fled in confusion. The panic quickly\r\nspread to the troops posted next to them; and the battle was hopelessly\r\nlost. Ottakar fought with desperate courage to the last; and, whether\r\nhe died sword in hand, or whether, as others say, he was killed by the\r\nStyrian nobles after he had surrendered, it is certain that his body\r\nwas found on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nWith him, for a time, fell the liberty and independence of Bohemia;\r\nand, though his son bore the name of king, and even recovered for\r\na short period an appearance of independence, yet, politically\r\nconsidered, the male line of those Bohemian native rulers, who traced\r\ntheir descent to Libus̆a and Pr̆emysl, came to an end on the plain of\r\nMarchfeld in August, 1278. Bohemian independence was, indeed, to revive\r\nunder a different form; and, nearly two centuries later, a native\r\nBohemian king was once more to rule at Prague; but never again was a\r\npurely Bohemian dynasty to be established on the throne.\r\n\r\nWith all its faults, the line of the Pr̆emyslovci had produced as many\r\nable and patriotic rulers as most royal houses can boast of. They had\r\nsteered their country through its difficult progress from Paganism\r\nto Christianity. They had reduced the rival kingdom of Poland from\r\nthe position of a dangerous aggressor into that of a tributary State.\r\nThey had helped to roll back the tide of Hungarian conquest; they had\r\nmade themselves a powerful factor in the policy of the German Empire.\r\nAmid the despair of Europe, they had stood almost alone against the\r\ncrushing invasion of the Tartars. And last, and most important of all,\r\nthey had begun to develop the municipal liberties of their country,\r\nin a way which gave good promise of future prosperity. That in this\r\nlast matter they had borrowed largely from German models, only showed\r\ntheir power of rising superior to a most natural national prejudice;\r\nwhile, in the case of Ottakar II., his enlightened policy towards the\r\nJews must have often brought upon him the rebukes of those clergy on\r\nwhom he so much relied for help. He failed, because he was not content\r\nto be king of Bohemia, but wished to be the head of a powerful State\r\nwhich could dictate the policy of the Empire. Had he been satisfied to\r\ndevelop the liberties of his own country in peace, he might have laid\r\nthe foundations of a State, which could even now have been playing an\r\nindependent part in the affairs of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTIME OF ANARCHY IN BOHEMIA FROM DEATH OF OTTAKAR II. TO ACCESSION OF\r\nCHARLES IV.\r\n\r\n(1278-1346.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf tried by the standard of ordinary conquerors, Rudolf of Hapsburg\r\nmust be admitted to have been merciful, and even generous, in his\r\ndealings with Bohemia. Although, after the death of Ottakar, he\r\ncontinued for some time to hold Moravia as a conquered province, he set\r\nhimself to restore those Moravian cities which had suffered by the war;\r\nand he readily confirmed all the municipal liberties, which had been\r\ngranted by Ottakar and previous kings. He always treated Kunigunda as a\r\nQueen; he secured to her, not only her own money dowry, but also that\r\ndistrict of Opava (in Moravia) which had been specially settled upon\r\nher; and, as will be seen, he protected her from the cruelty of the\r\nfriends in whom she had too rashly trusted. To her son, Wenceslaus, he\r\nwas even more generous. The daughter whom he had promised in 1276 to\r\nthe son of the still powerful King of Bohemia, he was still ready to\r\ngive to the orphan of a defeated and conquered man.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boy’s age permitted such a step, he restored him to his\r\nfather’s throne, and helped him, sometimes by wise advice and sometimes\r\nby force of arms, to maintain his power over his subjects. Doubtless\r\nthis policy, however magnanimous, was part of a scheme of action which\r\ntended to strengthen and increase Rudolf’s power. The towns in Moravia,\r\nwhose liberties he confirmed, he raised into free cities of the German\r\nEmpire; and he saw the wisdom of winning to his side, and holding\r\nin friendly subjection, the young and spirited King of a kingdom\r\nwhich had so often been a hindrance to schemes of Imperial policy.\r\nYet, allowing for these considerations, it cannot be denied that the\r\nconsistent execution of such a policy must have required a masterly\r\nself-restraint, and a splendid coolness of judgment, not often found in\r\nconquerors of any time.\r\n\r\nBut the feat which he had attempted was one which many circumstances\r\ncombined to make impossible; and men, of a very opposite type to\r\nRudolf’s, speedily frustrated his efforts for a peaceable and gradual\r\nabsorption of Bohemia in the German Empire. Queen Kunigunda had\r\nnaturally desired to make a further stand against her husband’s\r\nconqueror; and she called to her aid the son of that Otto of\r\nBrandenburg who had been Ottakar’s companion in arms, and afterwards\r\nhis brother-in-law. He came; and the queen had speedy cause to regret\r\nher invitation. The struggle between Otto and Rudolf was of short\r\nduration, and the Margrave was soon willing to accept the Emperor’s\r\nterms of peace and one of his inexhaustible tribe of daughters.\r\n\r\nOtto soon showed that it was not for the sake of the wife and son\r\nof his old friend that he had come to Bohemia. Under pretence of\r\ninvestigating some old charter of Ottakar’s, Otto sent German soldiers\r\nto Prague to find out the places where Ottakar’s bailiff had kept the\r\nroyal treasure. These soldiers entered one of the chief monasteries,\r\nand there discovered a large chest which had been used by many people\r\nduring the war as a storehouse for food, clothes, and other property.\r\nThis chest the Germans at once broke open and plundered of its\r\ncontents; and then, as if determined to offend the national feeling to\r\nthe utmost, they rushed into the chapel of St. Wenceslaus and rifled\r\nthe tomb of the saint.\r\n\r\nThese outrages were followed by a yet more daring act of violence.\r\nOtto suddenly entered Prague by night, seized the queen and prince\r\nin their rooms, while still half dressed, and carried them off to a\r\nfortress, where he set German soldiers to guard them, and would permit\r\nno Bohemian to see them. Some Bohemian nobles demanded the release of\r\nthese captives, and Otto promised to set them free; but he broke his\r\npromise. Kunigunda, indeed, by a series of ruses, succeeded in escaping\r\nfrom her imprisonment and taking refuge in her own special dominions at\r\nOpava; but her boy remained a prisoner in Otto’s hands.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the soldiers, who had been brought in by Otto to carry\r\nout his tyrannical purposes, began a series of plundering expeditions\r\non their own account. The unfortunate peasants fled from their fields\r\nand took refuge in the woods, leaving the lands wholly uncultivated.\r\nEven worse calamities fell on the towns. The large-minded policy of\r\nthe two Ottakars and of Wenceslaus I. now proved a source of evil\r\nand division. They had tried to induce Germans and Bohemians to live\r\ntogether in towns, established under German municipal laws, and\r\noften peopled in the first instance by German immigrants. But these\r\nenlightened kings had not been able thereby to stifle race-hatred and\r\njealousy; and the German settlers now looked upon the wild soldiers\r\nof Otto as their allies against the native Bohemian citizens. They\r\ninvited the leaders of the plundering parties into the towns, and with\r\ntheir help expelled the Bohemians. Prague was the only city strong\r\nenough to resist this Germanising process; and Tobias, the Bishop\r\nof Prague, tried to rally the faithful nobles of the kingdom round\r\nKunigunda. This effort was a desperate one; and, even when Otto left\r\nBohemia for a time, his viceroy, the Bishop of Brandenburg, carried his\r\nruthless policy still further, plundering the clergy and treating the\r\nremonstrances of Bishop Tobias with scorn and insolence.\r\n\r\nAt last the Bohemians were forced to call in their former conqueror\r\nto deliver them from this cruel tyranny; and Otto soon succumbed to\r\nthe Imperial forces. He consented to summon an Assembly at Prague, at\r\nwhich he appointed Bishop Tobias as chief ruler of the kingdom; and he\r\nfurther issued a decree that those Germans who had entered Bohemia for\r\nthe purposes of plunder should leave the country within three days.\r\nHe again promised to release young Wenceslaus, and again broke his\r\npromise. The German robbers, awed doubtless by the power of Rudolf,\r\nhastened to obey the orders of their master. But the evil seed which\r\nthey had sown did not cease to produce its natural fruits.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that for three years the lands had been left\r\nuncultivated; and trade, except where carried on by Germans, had been\r\ntotally paralysed. The consequence of these misfortunes was a terrible\r\nfamine. Unemployed workmen and starving peasants crowded into Prague\r\nand enforced by violence their demands for food and clothing. Driven\r\nout by the authorities of the city, they perished of cold in the woods;\r\nlarge holes were filled with the dead bodies; family affection ceased\r\nin the bitter struggle for life; and, when all kinds of strange food\r\nhad been tried and exhausted, mothers killed and ate their own children.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1283, a better harvest began to restore some hope for a\r\nreturn to human conditions of life. Then wild rumours and speculations\r\nfed the rising expectation. A beautiful rainbow was the source of\r\nbright prophecies; and a half belief began to arise in some minds that\r\nKing Ottakar was not really dead, and would return in triumph. Suddenly\r\na definite announcement took the place of dreams and fancies. Not\r\nOttakar, but his son Wenceslaus, was to return to reign in Bohemia.\r\nBase and sordid to the last, Otto had demanded from the half-starved\r\nBohemians a ransom of 35,000 marks, as compensation for what he called\r\nhis care and expense in guarding the young Bohemian king, in reality\r\nas a bribe not to break any more promises. But the sum was paid, and no\r\ndoubt willingly.\r\n\r\nThere is something inexpressibly touching in the enthusiasm which\r\ngreeted the return of the twelve-year-old king. Men, hardly recovered\r\nfrom years of starvation and plague, seemed at once convinced that at\r\nlast a better time was coming; and on June 9, 1283, barons, knights,\r\nclergy, citizens, and peasants flocked out to meet the young king,\r\nBishop Tobias leading the motley throng, and all singing the hymn\r\nof St. Adalbert, the opening words of which had served Ottakar as a\r\nwar-cry at the fatal battle of the Marchfeld.\r\n\r\nBut the troubles of Bohemia were not yet at an end. The boy followed\r\nhis most natural instinct in appealing to his mother to join him\r\nin Prague. Unfortunately, Kunigunda had in the meantime formed a\r\nconnection which proved most dangerous to the peace and order of the\r\ncountry. Zavis̆ of Falkenstein belonged to a noble family of Moravia,\r\nand he had succeeded in securing the queen’s affection during her\r\nresidence in Opava. Whether the marriage, which was recognised at a\r\nlater time, had already taken place, or whether, as some said, their\r\nconnection was one of illicit love, certain it is that it was the\r\naffection between them, rather than the form of its expression, which\r\nexcited the indignation and jealousy of the Bohemian nobles; and Zavis̆\r\nsoon justified that indignation.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he appear at the Court of Prague than he set himself to\r\noppose and drive away such patriots as Bishop Tobias, and to put his\r\nown favourites in their place. An insurrection quickly followed; and\r\nthough Rudolf exerted himself to pacify the insurgents, he soon showed\r\nin an unmistakable manner his own distrust of the new ruler of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1285, Wenceslaus, now arrived at his fourteenth year, was\r\nmarried to Guta, the daughter of Rudolf. Zavis̆ was so conscious of\r\nRudolf’s distrust, that he did not venture to enter the town where the\r\nmarriage was solemnised. This absence, however, did not satisfy the\r\nEmperor; and he took the extreme step of carrying back Guta with him,\r\nafter her marriage, to preserve her from the influences which prevailed\r\nat Prague. Either encouraged by these signs of Rudolf’s feelings, or\r\nirritated by some new insolence on the part of Zavis̆, the Bohemian\r\nnobles raised a second insurrection; but they were again unsuccessful,\r\nand it was not till the death of Kunigunda, in 1287, that Wenceslaus\r\nsucceeded in shaking off the power of his stepfather.\r\n\r\nAn excellent excuse for this final effort for freedom was supplied by\r\nRudolf, who declared that he would not restore Guta to her husband\r\nuntil Zavis̆ was banished from the court. Wenceslaus was, no doubt,\r\nglad enough to get back his wife in exchange for his stepfather; and,\r\nwhen Zavis̆ intrigued with the King of Hungary and tried to entrap\r\nWenceslaus, the young king decoyed him back to Prague and there\r\nimprisoned him. The friends of Zavis̆, both in Hungary and Bohemia,\r\nattempted his rescue; but Rudolf again intervened; and after the\r\nHungarian invasion had been repelled, Wenceslaus was at last persuaded\r\nby his Imperial father-in-law to put Zavis̆ to death.\r\n\r\nThe young king now devoted himself to the restoration of order. He\r\nbroke down castles, encouraged trade, extended the liberties of the\r\ncities, and gained a high reputation for justice. He even attempted to\r\nsubstitute for the vague mass of traditional custom a regular code of\r\nwritten laws; but in this attempt he was defeated by the nobles, who\r\noften showed themselves too strong for him.\r\n\r\nThe fatality which seemed to attend the best and most law-loving kings\r\nof Bohemia dragged Wenceslaus also into the complications of Imperial\r\nand Polish politics. In 1291 Rudolf died; and it soon became evident\r\nhow bitter was the hostility which the Hapsburg family had excited\r\namong the princes of Germany.\r\n\r\nAlbert, the son of Rudolf, had indeed made good his power in the\r\ndukedoms of Austria and Styria, but he had shown little sign of his\r\nfather’s vigour or ability; and the suspicion felt by the Bohemians\r\ntowards the whole house of Hapsburg was increased, in the case of\r\nAlbert, by the personal quarrels which had embittered his relations\r\nwith his brother-in-law, Wenceslaus. Rudolf, indeed, had made great\r\nefforts to preserve the peace; but, as soon as he was dead, the quarrel\r\nagain broke out, and Wenceslaus joined with other Electors of the\r\nEmpire to choose Adolf of Nassau as Emperor, in opposition to Albert.\r\n\r\nHis success in securing this election left the King of Bohemia free\r\nto carry on the struggle with Poland. He recovered the often-disputed\r\ntown of Cracow, and resumed that claim to the kingdom of Poland\r\nwhich, in some form or other, had been traditional in Bohemia since\r\nthe time of King Vladislav. Adolf would gladly have strengthened the\r\nallegiance of Wenceslaus by this or any other concession; but Albert\r\nhad an advantage which eventually enabled him to outbid his rival.\r\nHe still retained in his hands the towns of Eger (Cheb) and Pilsen\r\n(Plz̆en), which his father had never surrendered to Bohemia. These\r\ntowns, from their nearness to the Bavarian frontier, might be specially\r\ndangerous to the Bohemians if held by an enemy of their country; and\r\ntheir restoration to Wenceslaus meant the practical revival of Bohemian\r\nindependence. This bribe therefore proved too strong for Wenceslaus’s\r\nfaith; he withdrew his support from Adolf, and helped to place Albert\r\non the throne of the Empire. In the following year the King of Poland\r\nfinally surrendered his crown to Wenceslaus; and in 1300 Albert gave\r\nhis Imperial sanction to the union of Poland with Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another kingdom whose internal affairs had always a\r\ndangerous attraction for the kings of Bohemia. In 1301 the direct line\r\nof the old kings of Hungary came to an end; and a Hungarian bishop,\r\nbacked by some of the nobles, offered the crown to Wenceslaus. The\r\nyoung king, though refusing the offer on his own account, was disposed\r\nto accept it on behalf of his son; but this acceptance brought upon him\r\nthe hostility of the two greatest Powers of Europe. The Pope complained\r\nthat the election was uncanonical; because the bishop who had taken\r\nthe leading part in it was not authorised to crown the kings of\r\nHungary. The Emperor Albert, on his side, had already become suspicious\r\nof the growing power of Bohemia; and, according to one chronicler, his\r\navarice had been excited by the fame of the silver mines at Kuttenberg\r\n(Kutna Hora). Wenceslaus, indeed, though ready enough to hold his own\r\nagainst the Emperor, was as anxious as his father had been to remain on\r\ngood terms with the Pope. He acknowledged the irregularity in the form\r\nof his son’s election; and, at the same time, he entreated the Pope to\r\nsecure him the crown in a canonical manner. But it soon appeared that\r\nBoniface’s complaint about the form of election was a mere pretext, and\r\nthat the Pope was really intending to grant the crown of Hungary to the\r\nKing of Naples. To this arrangement Wenceslaus would not consent; and\r\nhence it came that in 1304 he was compelled to defend Bohemia against\r\nthe forces of the Empire, supported by the authority of the Pope. This\r\ntime, however, there was no division in the national feeling. However\r\nunwelcome some of Wenceslaus’s schemes might be to the Bohemian nobles,\r\nthey had too recently learnt, by bitter experience, the folly of\r\ndeserting a national king for a foreign invader. The Bohemians offered\r\na unanimous resistance to the Imperial army, and Albert was forced to\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nBut the doom of the male line of the House of Pr̆emysl was, none the\r\nless, hopelessly fixed. Wenceslaus died in the following year; and\r\nhis son, after resigning his claim to the kingdom of Hungary, gave\r\nhimself up to dissipation and profligacy. The Poles began to revolt;\r\nand during an expedition to Cracow the last of the male line of the\r\nPr̆emyslovci was murdered by a traitor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATHEDRAL OF OLMÜTZ On SITE OF CASTLE WHERE WENCESLAUS\r\nIII. WAS MURDERED.]\r\n\r\nIt seemed for the moment as if the turn of the House of Hapsburg had\r\nonce more come. During the bitter divisions in the Bohemian Assembly\r\nwhich followed the death of their king, Albert succeeded in thrusting\r\nhis son Rudolf on the attention of the Electors; and the majority of\r\nthose who were present consented to elect this prince to the Bohemian\r\nthrone, and even to declare their crown hereditary in the House of\r\nHapsburg. But this success was only momentary, for a fierce hatred of\r\nthe Hapsburgs was deeply rooted in the Bohemians; and, by a curious\r\nirony of fortune, the opponents of Rudolf called to their aid the\r\nson of that Duke of Carinthia who had won his Dukedom by supporting\r\nRudolf’s grandfather against Ottakar II. Rudolf died after a few\r\nmonths; and the majority of the next Assembly chose Henry of Carinthia\r\nas their king.\r\n\r\nBut Albert would not yet yield; and he set up his son Frederick as\r\nRudolf’s successor. The fight was a fierce one; and it was soon\r\nchanged from the attempt of an Emperor to conquer a new kingdom into a\r\nstruggle of the House of Hapsburg to maintain its political existence.\r\nThe opposition to that House was due, not only to the bitter Bohemian\r\nfeeling against the German oppressor, nor yet to the jealousy felt by\r\nthe great Princes of the Empire towards successful upstarts, but also\r\nto the hatred of those townsmen and peasants who had looked to Rudolf\r\nas their protector, and who found in his descendants their most deadly\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1308, the Emperor Albert was murdered by his nephew; and, as\r\nthe murderer was the son of Ottakar’s daughter, he was looked upon by\r\nthe Bohemians as the avenger of his grandfather. The Electors of the\r\nEmpire were now resolved that no further chance should be given to the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg; and Henry of Luxemburg was elected to the Imperial\r\nthrone. The fate of Bohemia once more followed that of the Empire;\r\nfor the new Emperor quickly saw his opportunity in the unpopularity\r\nof both the claimants of the Bohemian crown. He secured the hand of\r\nElizabeth, the daughter of Wenceslaus, for his son John, and thus paved\r\nthe way for the latter’s succession to the Bohemian throne. Hence it\r\ncame about that in 1310 the Estates of Prague enthusiastically welcomed\r\nJohn of Luxemburg as their king.\r\n\r\nIt even seemed, for the moment, as if this election would be the signal\r\nfor a yet more complete victory of the House of Luxemburg over that\r\nof Hapsburg; for, at the very same time, the Austrians suddenly rose\r\nagainst their Dukes, and expelled them from all but three towns of the\r\nDuchy. But the Emperor Henry refused to encourage this insurrection;\r\nand the Hapsburgs continued to maintain their position as Dukes of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nFew kings have ever succeeded to the rule of a foreign country\r\nwith a better hope of popularity than did John of Luxemburg. The\r\nterrible years of anarchy had made the Bohemians desirous of a strong\r\ngovernment, and ready to welcome any one who seemed to have force and\r\nvigour enough to restore order. As the rival of the hated House of\r\nHapsburg, and the deliverer from the incapable Henry of Carinthia, the\r\nnew king was specially acceptable; while his marriage with the daughter\r\nof Wenceslaus might have almost cheated the enthusiastic Bohemians\r\ninto the belief that they were once more to be governed by a national\r\nsovereign. John, too, seemed willing enough to meet these aspirations\r\nmore than half way. He not only recognised that claim, which had been\r\nformerly asserted against Vladislav, that Bohemians should not be\r\ncalled to fight outside their kingdom; but he declared that no official\r\nshould be appointed in Bohemia or Moravia who was not a native of those\r\ncountries; and, more startling still, that none but natives should be\r\nsuffered to buy lands, inheritances, fortresses, or any other rights\r\nwithin the country.\r\n\r\nBut it soon became evident that, if these promises were to be kept to\r\nthe ear, they were certain to be broken to the sense. The earliest\r\ncause of offence, was, no doubt, one which might be excused to a boy of\r\nfourteen. By the advice of his father, John accepted the Archbishop of\r\nMainz as his chief counsellor, and gradually drew around him a number\r\nof German courtiers. It appears, indeed, from trustworthy evidence,\r\nthat this German Churchman preserved better order in Bohemia than that\r\nwhich prevailed in the latter part of John’s reign; yet his position\r\nwas, notwithstanding, a most difficult one, and several circumstances\r\ncombined to make it impossible.\r\n\r\nThe national feeling of independence, which had been roused to new\r\nlife by the promises of John, was unfortunately manipulated at this\r\nperiod by one of those unscrupulous intriguers who sometimes drift to\r\nthe front in times of disorder. His name was Henry of Lipa; and he had\r\nalready played a part in the reign of Henry of Carinthia, in exciting\r\nthe nobles of Bohemia against the rulers of the towns.\r\n\r\nEver since the time of Ottakar II. the claim of the towns to a share\r\nin the government of Bohemia was being more strongly asserted; and a\r\ncontroversy which, under their native rulers, might have been settled\r\nby peaceful means, had led, in a time of foreign tyranny, to an\r\noutbreak of civil war. In the first phase of the struggle, the towns\r\nhad so far made good their claim that they were admitted to share in\r\nthe discussions of the Assembly which offered the crown to John; and\r\nsuch a victory must have tended to prejudice men like Henry of Lipa\r\nagainst the new king.\r\n\r\nNor was it difficult to give a national colouring to the class\r\nselfishness of the nobles. It will be remembered that Ottakar II. had\r\nintroduced a large German element into the towns which he had founded.\r\nThis measure of wise policy had been changed into a means of cruel\r\noppression by Otto of Brandenburg; and, unfortunately for the cause\r\nof the towns, Otto had been, apparently, the first ruler who summoned\r\ntheir representatives to share in the deliberations of the Estates of\r\nthe Realm.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Henry of Lipa added to his class prejudices a more personal\r\nreason for opposing the existing government. He was attached to the\r\nwidow of the late King Rudolf, who was known to her supporters as the\r\nQueen of Grätz; and he was resolved to make good both her claims and\r\nhis own at the expense of the peace and order of the country.\r\n\r\nTo the unscrupulous intriguers who were plotting against their power,\r\nJohn and the Archbishop of Mainz were unfortunately soon to supply\r\nsome just causes of complaint. The death of the Emperor Henry seemed\r\nto open to John a chance for claiming the Imperial throne; and, when\r\nhe found that his youth was held to disqualify him for that dignity,\r\nhe threw all his influence on to the side of Louis of Bavaria, as he\r\nwas resolved that no Hapsburg, at any rate, should again become Holy\r\nRoman Emperor. This contest withdrew both him and the Archbishop from\r\nBohemia; and the German Councillors who were left to support the queen\r\nwere little able to stand against Henry of Lipa. John soon found that\r\nhis championship of the Bavarian cause was likely to involve him in a\r\ndangerous war; and, fearing to leave a disturbed Bohemia behind him, he\r\nhastened to satisfy his opponents by dismissing his German advisers and\r\ntaking Henry of Lipa into his counsels.\r\n\r\nA new Hungarian war which broke out at this time enabled Henry to\r\nincrease his power, and he used it for inflicting new oppressions on\r\nthe Bohemian towns. But a bolder act of presumption at last exhausted\r\nthe patience of the Court. Henry ventured, without consulting king or\r\nqueen, to grant Agnes, the queen’s sister, in marriage to a Duke of\r\nSilesia. This insolence at last roused John to action, and Lipa was\r\narrested. Before any further steps could be taken, John was once more\r\ncalled to the German war; and he again left the Archbishop of Mainz\r\nas his viceroy. Henry of Lipa once more appealed to Bohemian feeling\r\nagainst the German prelate; and, though many of the better men among\r\nthe Bohemian nobility were now disposed to stand by their queen, they\r\nwere not strong enough to hold their own against these intrigues. John\r\nwas now earnestly entreated to return to Bohemia; but, when he hastened\r\nback, at the head of his Rhenish forces, his Bohemian advisers urged\r\nhim to leave the Germans behind, and to throw himself on the support of\r\nhis faithful nobles. John rejected this advice; he re-entered Bohemia\r\nat the head of his German troops, and proceeded to attack the lands of\r\nthose nobles who had resisted him.\r\n\r\nA general panic now seized the Bohemians; they recalled to their minds\r\nthe tyranny of Otto of Brandenburg; and the rumour quickly spread\r\nthat John was about to use German soldiers to crush out Bohemian\r\nindependence. What had been the intrigue of a mere selfish faction, now\r\nswelled into a national opposition; and the war raged fiercely. Henry\r\nof Lipa, indeed, remained the ostensible leader of the insurgents; but\r\nhe had so little sympathy with real national feeling, that he called\r\nin Frederick of Austria as his ally; and, when John offered terms to\r\nthe rebels, Henry refused them, on the ground that any treaty of peace\r\nmust also include the Austrians. At last the Emperor Louis intervened\r\nin the struggle. John was persuaded to send away his Rhenish troops, to\r\nrenew his promise to appoint only Bohemian advisers, and once more to\r\ngive high office in the State to Henry of Lipa. To these terms the king\r\nconsented; but Queen Elizabeth, with keener insight, refused altogether\r\nto trust this new Councillor; and Henry thereupon devoted his whole\r\nenergies to making mischief between the king and queen.\r\n\r\nThe intriguers had now discovered what manner of man they had to deal\r\nwith. Vain, profligate, and pleasure-seeking, John was easily persuaded\r\nby the young nobles that his wife had gained too much power over him;\r\nand, when they had once sown in his mind this suspicion, they were able\r\nto develop an elaborate romance of imaginary plots, by which the queen\r\nwas supposed to be undermining the throne of John, and securing the\r\npower to herself and her son. John’s selfish vanity soon drove him into\r\nviolent action. He hastened to the fortress where the queen was then\r\nstaying, and used such violent language that she fled in terror from\r\nthe place. Then he removed from her her favourite attendants, carried\r\noff her children, and shut up his eldest son for two months in a dark\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe indignation which this conduct caused among the citizens of Bohemia\r\nwas much increased by the various forms of extortion which John now\r\nproceeded to inflict both on towns and monasteries--extortions devised\r\nsolely to obtain money for the pleasures of the King and his courtiers.\r\nJohn, indeed, had been as ready as any other King of Bohemia to promise\r\nthe citizens exemption from certain forms of taxation; and consequently\r\nthey now complained, not only of oppression, but also of broken faith.\r\nNor was it merely in the matter of taxes that the privileges of the\r\ncitizens were violated. In earlier times the nobles had claimed the\r\nright of demanding forcible quartering in the houses of citizens for\r\nthose who were engaged on expeditions in the king’s service. This claim\r\nnaturally led to great abuses, against which Ottakar and Wenceslaus had\r\ntried to protect their subjects. In this matter also John had promised\r\nto carry out the policy of his predecessors. But he now encouraged even\r\nhis own kinsmen to demand this compulsory entertainment. One citizen\r\nwas seized and crucified because he would not give up his money to\r\nthese intruders; others were plundered and unjustly imprisoned.\r\n\r\nAt last the citizens of Prague drew up a formal complaint, which they\r\nauthorised six of their number to present to John. Some mischief-maker\r\npersuaded the king that this protest was a first step to insurrection;\r\nand his suspicions were further inflamed by the news that the queen\r\nhad recently come to Prague, and had been received with great honour.\r\nFurious at this supposed conspiracy, the king and Henry of Lipa at once\r\nmarched against Prague. The citizens, astonished at the interpretation\r\nwhich had been put upon their remonstrance, were at first disposed to\r\nadmit the king, in the hopes of an easy explanation; but some of the\r\nnobles, who had remained faithful to the queen, were opposed to this\r\npolicy; and they offered such determined resistance, that John was\r\ncompelled to retreat from the city. A sort of truce was patched up for\r\na time, though John insisted that the six citizens who had drawn up the\r\nremonstrance should be expelled from the city. Then he hurried away\r\nto finish the war between Louis and Frederick; and Henry of Lipa was\r\nleft chief ruler of the kingdom. He soon succeeded in bringing to an\r\nend the temporary reconciliation between John and Elizabeth; and the\r\nqueen was forced to fly to Bavaria, where she remained for some time,\r\nin dependence on her Bavarian relations, since John would not allow any\r\nsupport to be sent to her from Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThen followed many years of oppression and disorder, during which\r\nJohn only appeared in Bohemia when he wished to demand money from the\r\ncitizens, which he then hastened to spend at Paris or on the Rhine,\r\neither in the provision of splendid tournaments, or on some of the many\r\nwars which the princes of the Empire were waging against each other or\r\nagainst the Imperial towns. John’s special attraction was to Paris,\r\nwhere the court of King Charles was becoming a centre of pleasure and\r\nexcitement. It was probably his alliance with this king which gradually\r\nseparated John from the cause of Louis of Bavaria; for Charles felt\r\nhimself bound to stand by his dependant at Avignon, Pope John XXII.,\r\nwho had always been opposed to the claims of Louis.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of disorder the nobles had gradually succeeded in\r\ndrawing into their power many of the royal fortresses; and, the central\r\nauthority being thus fatally weakened, robbery and violence prevailed\r\nthroughout the country. Poor Elizabeth ventured back to Prague about\r\n1325; and she used her best efforts for the good of her country. On the\r\noccasion of a plague, she arranged processions in which sacred relics\r\nof great value were publicly exhibited; she endowed monasteries, and\r\nprotected them, even with a high hand, against the intrusions of the\r\nnobles; while, for her personal consolation, she contemplated a thorn\r\nfrom the Sacred Crown, which King Charles of France had sent her as a\r\npresent during some of the revels which her husband was enjoying at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nBishop John of Prague might have given her some help in the government\r\nof the country; but he was summoned to Avignon to be tried as a\r\nprotector of heretics, and detained there for thirteen years before\r\nhe was tried and acquitted. It was impossible, however, to expect that\r\neither the queen or the bishop could hold their own against such men\r\nas Henry of Lipa; and, after the death of the queen in 1330, even King\r\nJohn began gradually to realise that some better provision must be made\r\nfor the government of the country. So, three years later, he consented\r\nto send his eldest son, who had hitherto been detained at Paris, to try\r\nhis hand at the restoration of order in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThis son had originally been named Wenceslaus, at the time when John\r\nwas still hoping to conciliate the national feeling of Bohemia; but\r\nhe had subsequently been re-named Charles, in honour of John’s model\r\nand ally, the King of France. He was now seventeen years old; he was\r\nwelcomed by the Bohemians as the son of their beloved Elizabeth, and\r\nhis dignified and straightforward manners tended to increase the\r\nattachment of his subjects. He speedily showed that enthusiasm for\r\nhis mother’s country which was to produce such striking results, when\r\nonce his hand was free. By judicious economy, he tried to buy back for\r\nthe Crown those castles which had been mortgaged to the nobles; and\r\nhe made progresses through his dominions, hearing the grievances of\r\nthe people and trying to redress them. This policy did not suit those\r\ndisorderly nobles who had hitherto ruled at their pleasure. They easily\r\nsucceeded in stirring up John’s suspicions against his son, as they\r\nhad previously done against his wife; and Charles was deprived of his\r\npower and sent off to the Tyrol. Not many years elapsed, however,\r\nbefore John discovered that his son would be still necessary to him,\r\nif he wished to gain any advantage from the kingdom of Bohemia. But\r\nCharles had now realised that his father was habitually sacrificing the\r\nhonour and freedom of the country for the sake of his own pleasures;\r\nand in 1342 the young prince declared that he would only undertake the\r\ngovernment of Bohemia if John would consent to stay away from it for\r\ntwo years, and would be content with the sum of five thousand marks\r\nduring that period.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling in Bohemia was strongly in favour of Charles, as\r\nagainst his father. Indeed, so hated had the latter become, that,\r\nwhen he was shortly after afflicted with blindness, many Bohemians\r\nconsidered that this suffering was a judgment upon him for his cruelty\r\nand oppression. He therefore considered it advisable to accept these\r\nterms; and Charles’s position was made still easier by the friendship\r\nof Pope Clement VI., who, while anxious to conciliate the friendship of\r\nJohn, was keenly alive to the desirability of securing to his side the\r\nnational sentiment of Bohemia. He therefore raised the Church of Prague\r\ninto an archbishopric, emancipating it entirely from the archbishopric\r\nof Mainz; and he also conceded that often disputed demand for the use\r\nof the Slavonic ritual in the monasteries of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, both John and Clement had a very special reason for desiring\r\nto keep the popular young prince in friendly alliance with them. The\r\nambition, which John had once cherished on his own behalf, had now been\r\nturned into a desire for the exaltation of his son. For different\r\nreasons both the King and the Pope were now eager for the overthrow\r\nof Louis of Bavaria; and they heartily agreed that Charles was the\r\nmost hopeful candidate for the Imperial throne. The other Electors\r\nwere equally ready for this change; and in July, 1346, Charles was\r\nchosen Holy Roman Emperor. Such a step could not long fail to produce\r\ndangerous results; but, before the opponents of the new Emperor were\r\nprepared for action, the attention of Europe was distracted from their\r\nquarrels by a war between England and France. John eagerly rushed to\r\nthe support of his old ally; and, in August, 1346, he died fighting at\r\nthe battle of Crecy--a death much admired by the readers of romances,\r\nand an infinite relief to the oppressed Bohemians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF CHARLES IV.\r\n\r\n(1346-1378.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing the life of men who have played a great part in the affairs\r\nof the world, it is generally possible to find some hint in the earlier\r\nperiods of their life of a preparation for the important work which has\r\ndistinguished their later years. In the case of Charles IV. this link\r\nseems at first sight exceptionally difficult to find. He had been torn\r\naway from his mother’s influence in his earliest childhood; treated\r\nwith exceptional harshness, at that tender age, by his father; kept\r\naway so long from the country which he was afterwards to govern, that\r\nwhen he first returned to it he had completely forgotten the Bohemian\r\nlanguage; suddenly thrust into a partial government of the country, at\r\nthe age of seventeen; regarded by his father and those who surrounded\r\nhim with the utmost suspicion, and snatched away from the government\r\nwhen he was just beginning to get a firm hold of it. Then he was\r\ndragged into Italian wars with which he had little sympathy, and where\r\nmen seemed to fight as much with poison as with swords; a witness of\r\nhis father’s dissolute life, and surrounded by evil companions; and,\r\nto crown all his difficulties, when he had attained to full manhood,\r\nbut had not yet become king of Bohemia, he had been suddenly raised to\r\nthe highest dignity in Europe. Such was the preparation which Charles\r\nhad received for the government of a kingdom which required special\r\nknowledge, special sympathies, and somewhat exclusive care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Karl IV. mit der Kaiserin Anna.\r\n\r\nLIKENESS TAKEN FROM CHAPEL IN CARLSTEIN.]\r\n\r\nBut in the fragment of autobiography which Charles has left us, he has\r\nhimself supplied the clue to at least some part of this difficulty.\r\nThat residence in Paris, and intimacy with the King of France, which\r\nwas to John merely a new opportunity for self-indulgence and luxury,\r\ngave to Charles both that interest in the higher education of a people\r\nwhich was of so much service to Bohemia, and a personal zeal for study\r\nwhich doubtless saved him from many of the evils which surrounded\r\nhim. The King of France took a great fancy to his young namesake;\r\nand, though he and most of his family were ignorant of literature, he\r\nsaw the value of it for others, and urged his chaplain to encourage\r\nCharles in his studies. Paris was at that time the centre of learning.\r\nIt contained the most completely organised University, except that\r\nof Bologna; and it attracted students from many parts of Europe. The\r\ninfluence of the king’s chaplain doubtless developed in Charles that\r\nreverence for the clergy and the pope which was, perhaps, more of a\r\nreal moral conviction in him than in any prince of his time. He was\r\nalso fortunate in the ease with which he acquired new languages; and\r\nthis gift enabled him to recover his power of speaking Bohemian without\r\nlosing his knowledge of German. Whence he could have derived that\r\nintense Bohemian feeling, which showed itself in all the more important\r\nacts of his life, sometimes even to the prejudice of his work as German\r\nEmperor, it is very difficult to say; but, doubtless, the fervent and\r\npractical piety, which always distinguished him, led him to cling to\r\nsuch traditions as he could gather about the mother of whom he had\r\nseen so little; and the zeal for her country, when he saw the wrongs\r\ninflicted on it by his father, would have been quickened in him by that\r\nhatred of injustice and oppression which was so strong an element in\r\nhis character. But, be the causes what they may, certain it is that the\r\nfirst important use which he made of his double power of Bohemian king\r\nand German emperor was to lay the foundations of a scheme for making\r\nPrague the intellectual centre, not only of Bohemia, but of the whole\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, as elsewhere, book-learning had primarily been considered\r\nas part of the training of the clergy. Under Ottakar II., indeed, an\r\nattempt had been made to enlarge the range of studies, and perhaps to\r\ninterest in them people of other professions and races. But, after\r\nthe fall of Ottakar, Rudolf had feared anything which would attract\r\nhis Austrian subjects to Bohemia; and the Austrian students had been\r\nordered to leave Prague. Wenceslaus II. had tried to revive and develop\r\nhis father’s ideas; but, as it was not even then understood that a\r\nUniversity could be intended for all men, the nobles successfully\r\nopposed the scheme, as an attempt to increase the power of the clergy.\r\n\r\nCharles soon showed that, while anxious to work with the clergy in\r\nthis, as in other matters, he yet aimed at something much higher and\r\nwider than a mere clerical school. Doctors of law, medicine, and\r\nnatural science were summoned to join in his new institution; and the\r\nFaculties were organised, partly on the model of Paris and partly of\r\nBologna. The Rector, who was elected by masters and students, was\r\nthe chief judge of the University; but, in the matters which purely\r\nrelated to their own art or science, the elected heads of the Faculties\r\nwere left to manage their own affairs. Important as the lectures at\r\nthe University were considered, a great deal of the instruction was\r\nconveyed through the medium of public discussions, in some of which\r\nall the Masters of Arts were compelled to take part. Questions of the\r\nalterations of the Statutes were decided by a general assembly, in\r\nwhich masters and students had equal votes.\r\n\r\nBut one of the most distinctive points of Charles’s scheme, and one\r\nwhich produced most important effects both for good and evil, was\r\nthe division of the University into four Nations. These were called\r\nrespectively the Bohemian, Bavarian, Polish, and Saxon. The Bohemian\r\nNation included Hungary; the Bavarian, most of South Germany; the\r\nPolish, Prussia and Silesia; and the Saxon, all the rest of North\r\nGermany, with Denmark and Sweden. Each of these Nations chose one\r\nElector; the four Electors chose seven others; the seven chose five;\r\nand then these five chose the Rector of the University. For special\r\ncases, not dealt with by the general assembly, a council of eight was\r\nappointed, containing two representatives from each Nation. How much\r\nCharles desired to make his University a centre for the whole Empire\r\nmay be gathered from the fact that among the first eight professors\r\none was a Saxon, one a Westphalian, and one a Frenchman. The tendency\r\nto welcome men of learning was characteristic of Charles’s reign; nor\r\nwas his welcome confined to teachers and writers; artists also shared\r\nhis patronage; and his reign was marked by efforts after external\r\nsplendour and stern morality which are seldom found in combination. The\r\nmost remarkable outward symbol of these divergent tendencies is the\r\ncelebrated fortress of Carlstein (Karluv Tyn, Charles’s town), which,\r\nin its form, its decoration, and special objects, seems to combine the\r\nmemories of Charles’s work as king, as moral reformer, and as patron of\r\nArt. Devised for the better protection of the crown jewels, and, at a\r\nsomewhat later period, of the charters of Bohemia, it also afforded a\r\nplace of retirement for periods of strict and almost ascetic devotion;\r\nwhile the pictures on its walls, and the precious stones which cover\r\nits roof, recall the memory of the encouragement which the King gave to\r\nthe Arts of his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARLSTEIN (KARLUV TYN).]\r\n\r\nBut the attempt to combine his work as Emperor with his work as King\r\nof Bohemia was to be the great difficulty of his career; and scarcely\r\nhad he succeeded in bringing the University into working order before\r\nthe great rush of students began to alarm the inhabitants of Prague.\r\nComplaints were made of disorders, of the high price of provisions,\r\nand of difficulties arising from the want of accommodation in the\r\ncity. This last objection Charles proceeded to meet by founding a new\r\nsuburb of Prague, to be united by ditch, wall, and bridge with the\r\nold city, and to enjoy the same privileges as the rest of Prague.\r\nThis helped forward Charles’s plans for raising Prague into Imperial\r\nimportance; and the work of uniting all the different parts of the\r\ncity was undertaken on so splendid a scale that, in a time of famine,\r\nCharles was able to solve “the problem of the unemployed,” by setting\r\nmore than a thousand men to work on the new walls. But there still\r\nremained the disorders which had been brought about by the arrival of\r\nGerman students, who distrusted the justice of Bohemian tribunals. In\r\norder to restore peace, Charles placed the University directly under\r\nhis own authority, and allowed no appeal from the decisions of the\r\nRector, except to the highest court. This creation of an independent\r\ncorporation of learning was a necessary stage in the growth of the\r\nUniversity, and contained seeds both of good and evil, to be developed\r\nat a later time.\r\n\r\nIn the founding of this University, Charles had aimed at the\r\naccomplishment of two different objects; the establishment of an\r\nintellectual centre for the Empire, and the development of a new life\r\nin Bohemia. The second of these objects was probably the one nearest to\r\nhis heart; and it was not only by the encouragement of learning that\r\nhe hoped to promote it, but by attention to every phase of national\r\nwell-being. He, like his grandfather Wenceslaus, desired to substitute\r\na written code of laws for the floating mass of customs and traditions\r\nby which Bohemia was, in great part, governed. How far Wenceslaus had\r\ngone towards the execution of this plan cannot be ascertained; but\r\nCharles actually drew up his code, and gave it the name of the Majestas\r\nCarolina. If we may judge from his preface, and from the subject which\r\nstands first in the code, the cause of oppression and disorder which\r\nmost impressed him in Bohemia was the alienation of royal lands by the\r\nKings. The power which special nobles had gained, through these grants,\r\nhad been often used in a most disorderly manner. The efficiency of the\r\ncentral Executive had been unduly weakened; and an excuse had been\r\ngiven for those continual demands for exceptional taxation, which had\r\nso painfully marked the reign of King John. Charles therefore drew up a\r\ncareful list of the cities and lands, which, under no circumstances,\r\nshould be alienated by the King, nor should any grant of them be asked\r\nfor by others. Special arrangements were made for the registration,\r\nin a public court, of lands sold by the nobles; lands were not to be\r\ngranted to the “dead hand”; special means of remedy were to be provided\r\nagainst oppression by the King; special restrictions were to be placed\r\non the power of nobles over their dependants. Other provisions of\r\nvarious importance were contained in this document; but the great,\r\nand essential, point about it was, that these “Constitutions” were to\r\nbe read four times a year in Bohemia, before a full assembly of the\r\npeople, that all might know the laws by which they were governed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAGUE (PRAHA) in 1200.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAGUE (PRAHA) in 1388.\r\n\r\nMAPS SHOWING GROWTH OF PRAGUE UNDER CHARLES IV.]\r\n\r\nThis provision pointed to Charles’s chief object in composing the\r\nCode; and it was doubtless this very demand which roused to its\r\nheight the opposition of the nobles. It was not merely this or that\r\nprivilege which the King was threatening; it was the whole fabric of\r\nfeudal power, which depended much more on the separate and individual\r\ninfluence of each noble on his estate, than on any decrees of a\r\ncollective Assembly; and this influence must necessarily give way\r\nbefore a code of written law, set forth by the King, and accepted and\r\nsupported by the main body of the people.\r\n\r\nCharles was no “benevolent despot,” determined to thrust upon his\r\npeople, by force, principles of government for which they were not\r\nprepared. He yielded to the resistance of the nobles, and withdrew the\r\nmain part of the Majestas Carolina. The concession was undoubtedly a\r\nwise one; and, however excellent were many of the changes which he had\r\nproposed, there were parts of this remarkable document which make one\r\nglad that they were not stereotyped in a code, nor sanctified in the\r\nmemories of Bohemians by so close a connection with their popular king.\r\nThus, for instance, Charles opens his code with a strong declaration\r\nof devotion to the Catholic faith, with a prohibition to Pagans and\r\nSaracens against settling in Bohemia, and with a promise to put down\r\nheresy with the sword.[4] Again, the declaration of the power of lords\r\nover their dependants is only limited by taking from the lords the\r\nright of putting out their eyes or cutting off their hands and feet;\r\nand though Charles, no doubt, was thinking more of these limitations\r\nthan of the power which he still left to the nobles; yet it was obvious\r\nthat such a statement in a code might be used in the very opposite\r\nsense to that in which it was written. That is to say, the code might\r\nhave been appealed to in later times as securing to the nobles all the\r\npowers of which it did not expressly deprive them.\r\n\r\nBut Charles had the statesmanlike instinct which tells a man when to\r\nyield and when to stand firm. There was one reform on which he was\r\ndetermined, and which he insisted on carrying out in spite of the\r\nopposition of the nobles. This was the abolition of those supposed\r\ntests of justice, by which accused persons were compelled to hold, or\r\nto walk upon, burning iron, or to prove their innocence by risking\r\ndrowning. We are so apt to consider these superstitions as bound up\r\nwith old religious feelings, that we almost instinctively expect to\r\nfind this kind of abuse supported by the pious and orthodox in those\r\ngenerations, and opposed chiefly by some coldly superior persons\r\nwho are untouched by the popular feeling of the time. But nothing\r\nis clearer than that Charles was stirred to this great reform by an\r\nintense sense of piety and reverence. Witness the words by which he\r\nhad preluded this reform in the Majestas Carolina. “For he who should\r\npresume to tempt the omnipotence of God, and to make ridiculous His\r\nsecret judgment, by forcing his neighbour to perish by means contrary\r\nto nature, does not deserve to enjoy the comfort of his own natural\r\nlife.” In this reform he was steadily supported by Archbishop Arnestus;\r\nand, in spite of the opposition of the nobles, he succeeded in getting\r\nthese terrible abuses suppressed. With regard to the ordeal by battle\r\nhe was less successful. Indeed he was apparently disposed to accept\r\na rather curious compromise on the subject. Duelling of all kinds he\r\nloathed as disorderly; but, in the case of charges of treason, he\r\npermitted a prosecutor who could bring nine respectable witnesses to\r\nsupport his charge, to make good his accusation by the final test of\r\nthe duel. It does not appear, however, that he succeeded in reducing\r\nthis foolish practice even within these limits.\r\n\r\nLastly, and perhaps best of all, he secured to the peasantry the\r\nright of appealing to the King from the feudal courts of their lords.\r\nDoubtless the readiness of the nobles to accept this important reform\r\nwas much increased by Charles’s willingness to do justice as against\r\nhimself. Thus, in a dispute with some nobles about the possession of\r\na certain castle, he consented to submit the question to two Bohemian\r\nnobles chosen for the purpose; and he abode by the compromise which\r\nthey suggested.\r\n\r\nIn short, in his position as King of Bohemia, Charles generally\r\nappears as one of those exceptional rulers who combine a genuine\r\nzeal for reform with a real sense of justice, and that statesmanlike\r\nself-restraint which teaches a man the difference between the desirable\r\nand the possible, between the ultimate ideal and the immediately\r\npracticable. But it is impossible to separate Charles the Emperor from\r\nCharles the King of Bohemia. Many of his greatest reforms, such as the\r\nestablishment of the University and the assertion of the independence\r\nof the Prague archbishopric, could not have been carried out so easily,\r\nperhaps not at all, unless he had been able to use his authority as\r\nEmperor to back his power as King of Bohemia, and to secure also the\r\nsympathy and approval of the Pope. So thoroughly was the connection\r\nof his Imperial office with his Bohemian kingship recognised by his\r\nsubjects, that it is the rarest thing to find this popular King\r\nmentioned in the chronicles by his proper Bohemian title of Charles I.,\r\nstill less by his early name of Wenceslaus. The _Emperor_ Charles IV.\r\nhas overshadowed and absorbed Wenceslaus alias Charles I. of Bohemia;\r\nand yet so far was he from losing thereby the sympathies of the\r\nBohemians, that it is they and not the Germans who cherish his memory\r\nas that of a great and popular ruler.\r\n\r\nThe German view, indeed, is more nearly represented by the saying of\r\nMaximilian I., “Charles was the father of Bohemia, but the stepfather\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire.” This saying, like most epigrams that have\r\nlived, has a mixture of truth and falsehood. Certainly one of the\r\nmorals of Charles’s career might seem to be the impossibility of\r\ncombining these two important offices in a manner which should satisfy\r\nthe just demands both of Germans and Bohemians. But though, as will\r\npresently appear, the weaker and worse part of his policy was connected\r\nwith his position as Emperor, yet there is evident, even in his plans\r\nfor Germany, a real enthusiasm for order, good government, and, above\r\nall, independence of that Papal power which had paralysed German\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Bull, with which his name is specially connected, shows\r\nin many respects these noble aims. The disorderly state into which\r\nthe Empire had fallen had been largely due to the uncertainty of the\r\nElectorate. The titles which carried with them a right of voting for\r\nthe Emperor, had been so often shared by different claimants, and the\r\nlands which originally marked these titles had been so often divided,\r\nthat few could tell who had really the right of choosing the ruler of\r\nEurope; while the irregularity of many elections had given opportunity\r\nfor the assertion of spurious claims, like those of the Dukes of\r\nBavaria. Charles fixed the Electorate on a clear basis, and settled the\r\nlands which gave the right of voting. He also sternly prohibited those\r\nprivate feuds which had done such evil in Germany. Lastly, he boldly\r\nasserted the right of the Electors to choose the Emperor, without\r\nwaiting for confirmation of their choice by the Pope. But, at the same\r\ntime, he secured for the King of Bohemia the leading position among the\r\nElectors of the Empire; he declared his independence of the Imperial\r\ncourts; and he asserted the right of the Bohemians to choose their own\r\nking, as soon as the House of Luxemburg was extinct.\r\n\r\nObviously there was here much to provoke opposition. The smaller\r\nprinces, fierce at the restriction on their rights of quarrelling,\r\nbroke into fresh disorders; the dukes of Bavaria took up arms to\r\nreassert their suppressed electoral rights; the dukes of Austria\r\nwere indignant that their claims to the Bohemian succession, founded\r\non the decree passed in King Rudolf’s Assembly, were now definitely\r\nrepudiated. Charles dealt in different ways with these sets of\r\nopponents. The turbulent rioters he forcibly suppressed, but readily\r\nadmitted to favour when repentant. From Bavaria, however, he thought it\r\nnecessary to take stronger securities. After he had defeated the Dukes\r\nin battle, he succeeded in persuading them to sell to him lands and\r\ncities, which he added to the kingdom of Bohemia, and thereby extended\r\nthat kingdom as far as Nürnberg. It might be plausibly urged that\r\nBohemia needed securities for peace against so turbulent a neighbour as\r\nBavaria; but it was evident, from the additions to his kingdom which\r\nCharles carried out at a later time, that this was but part of his\r\nscheme for securing to Bohemia that predominance in the Empire which\r\nwas hinted at in the Golden Bull. Bavaria and the smaller princes being\r\nbrought to reason, there remained still the struggle with Austria. Here\r\none might have expected that the long-standing feud between Bohemian\r\nand Austrian, and between the House of Luxemburg and the House of\r\nHapsburg, would have made the contest deadly in its course and crushing\r\nin its results. Strange to say, it ended in a settlement which must,\r\neven at the time, have startled some Bohemians, though no doubt they\r\ncould never have expected that the following century would see the\r\nclaim then legalised grow into practical results. In consideration of\r\nthe peaceable abandonment by the House of Hapsburg of its immediate\r\nclaims, it was promised the succession to the throne of Bohemia as soon\r\nas the direct lines of Charles and of his brother John should have come\r\nto an end. In all these matters Charles had shown a genuine desire for\r\npeace and order, which must surely deserve all recognition.\r\n\r\nThe same credit cannot be given to another phase of his policy, which\r\narose from his relations with Louis, the son of his former rival, the\r\nEmperor Louis of Bavaria. The causes of this quarrel must be shortly\r\ntold. John, the brother of Charles, had married Margaretha Maultasche,\r\nCountess of Tyrol; and he had thereby acquired her lands. Margaretha,\r\nwho seems to have been as foul in mind as she was ugly in face, made a\r\nfalse charge of impotency against her husband; and, under this excuse,\r\nshe hastened to welcome the advances of young Louis, the son of the\r\nEmperor, who helped her to drive her husband from the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor recognised a so-called marriage between his son and\r\nMargaretha; and this act contributed not a little to the storm of\r\nindignation which drove the Bavarian from the throne of the Empire and\r\nraised Charles to his place. Charles was scarcely seated on the throne,\r\nbefore he resolved to revenge his brother by a raid on the Tyrol.\r\nThe raid produced no results but bloodshed and misery; and John was\r\nforced to console himself for the loss of his lands by the Margravate\r\nof Moravia, and for the loss of Margaretha by marriage with a more\r\nfaithful wife.\r\n\r\nBut the quarrel between Charles and Louis was not yet at an end. On\r\nthe extinction of the line of the former Margraves of Brandenburg, the\r\nterritory had been granted to Louis by his father, and he had remained\r\nin undisturbed possession of it for several years. Suddenly, in 1348,\r\na claimant came forward to the Margravate. This man declared that his\r\nname was Waldemar; that he was son of the late Margrave of Brandenburg;\r\nthat, since 1319, he had been supposed to be dead; that his death had\r\nbeen really pretended, in order to escape from a marriage, which, after\r\nits celebration, he had found to be illegal; and lastly that, his wife\r\nbeing now dead, he had come forward to claim his inheritance. The\r\nstory was sufficiently absurd; and it might have been thought that,\r\neven if it were true, a prince who had pretended to be dead for nearly\r\nthirty years, might, in the interest of peace, consent to pretend a\r\nlittle longer. Charles’s excuse for crediting the imposture was that,\r\nas he was too young to remember the real Waldemar, he trusted in the\r\nevidence of the Duke of Saxony and other princes of the Empire, who,\r\nafter investigating the case, declared their belief in the genuineness\r\nof the claim. Encouraged by this evidence, Charles only too gladly\r\nseized the opportunity for avenging his brother. He declared war on\r\nLouis, removed him from his Margravate, and established Waldemar in\r\nhis place. Eventually it was proved that the so-called Waldemar was\r\nthe subject and tool of the Duke of Saxony; and Charles, convinced of\r\nthe imposture, was forced to reinstate Louis in Brandenburg. But, his\r\nattention once fixed on this province, he saw in it a new opportunity\r\nfor aggrandising his House and Kingdom; and, in restoring it to Louis,\r\nhe secured to his own son Wenceslaus the succession to the Margravate.\r\n\r\nBut, if this unfortunate episode illustrates afresh the dangers which\r\nCharles had to encounter in combining his positions of German Emperor\r\nand Bohemian King, there was at least one side of his policy for which\r\nGermans, even more than Bohemians, have cause to thank him. It has\r\nalready been mentioned that in the Golden Bull Charles had asserted\r\nthe right of the Electors of the Empire to choose an Emperor without\r\nwaiting for the confirmation of the Pope. This bold proposal was\r\nconnected with that desire for a German rather than a Roman Empire,\r\nwhich Rudolf of Hapsburg and other wise rulers had cherished. Charles,\r\nas we shall see, had no desire to weaken the Papacy in spiritual\r\nmatters, and he had been willing enough to go to Rome to be formally\r\ncrowned in the sacred city; but he wished to free the German princes\r\nfrom that intolerable burden of the rule over Italy which was always\r\ninvolving the Emperors in useless expeditions, and at the same time to\r\nprevent the Popes from interfering in German affairs.\r\n\r\nIn his desire to escape from the burden of Italian politics, Charles\r\nhad to resist the pressure of two advisers, each remarkable in his\r\nspecial way, and each disposed to revive the memory of that expedition\r\nto Italy, which Charles’s grandfather, Henry of Luxemburg, had so\r\nrashly attempted. The interview between the first of these advisers\r\nand the King must have been most impressive. It was during a temporary\r\ncoolness between Charles and Pope Clement VI., that Charles, while\r\nstaying in his palace at Prague, was informed that a merchant, who\r\nhad recently come to the city, desired to see him on urgent business.\r\nThe supposed merchant was admitted; but when called on to state his\r\nbusiness, replied with the startling words, that he had been sent to\r\nCharles by a hermit, to inform him that God the Father and God the Son\r\nhad hitherto ruled the world; but that in future it would be ruled\r\nby the Holy Spirit alone.[5] This formula was apparently familiar\r\nto Charles, for he at once recognised the speaker as the ex-tribune\r\nRienzi. Rienzi, when challenged, at once admitted his identity; then\r\nhe went on to give a sketch of the rise and fall of his government in\r\nRome, and urged Charles to send him back to Rome as his representative.\r\nThe strain of mysticism in Rienzi’s language, coupled with the Pope’s\r\nformer warnings, alarmed the orthodox Charles, and he sent at once\r\nfor Archbishop Arnestus. A few questions from Arnestus soon involved\r\nRienzi in statements which savoured of heresy. The archbishop at once\r\narrested him, and soon after sent him to Avignon, where he was kept as\r\na prisoner for some time. Even from prison Rienzi appealed to Charles\r\nfor sympathy, on the ground that he was the illegitimate son of the\r\nEmperor Henry, and therefore Charles’s uncle. Charles replied that\r\nsuch a consideration would not affect his action, as we all came from\r\nAdam; and he urged Rienzi to think of his soul, and not to listen\r\nto the friar, whose prophecies would drag him to ruin. The end of\r\nRienzi’s career is well known; how, returning as Senator and Papal\r\nrepresentative to the city which he had formerly governed in the name\r\nof the People, he was soon after murdered by the Romans, whom he had\r\ntried to restore to the “Good State.”\r\n\r\nThe other adviser, who tried to involve Charles in the responsibilities\r\nof the government of Rome, was a man of very different type. This was\r\nthe poet Petrarch, who had first been interested in Charles by the\r\nadmiration which the latter had expressed, during a visit to Avignon,\r\nfor the beautiful Laura. So good a judge of beauty must, of course,\r\nbe the poet’s ideal ruler; and Petrarch was only too eager to play\r\nthe part of Dante to the grandson of Henry of Luxemburg. His first\r\nappeal to Charles was left unanswered; but, after the fall of Rienzi,\r\nthe poet returned to the attack, and urged upon the Emperor the duty\r\nof coming to Rome, and administering the Holy Roman Empire from its\r\ncapital. Charles had heard much of Petrarch between the writing of\r\nthese two letters; and, admiring his graceful style, readily entered\r\ninto correspondence with him, and pointed out to him the difficulties\r\nand dangers of the course which he advised. Petrarch did not cease to\r\nurge his proposal, and twice he fancied that his dream was about to be\r\nrealised; once, when Charles went to Rome to be crowned by the Papal\r\nrepresentative, and again, at a later time, when he consented to escort\r\nthe Pope from Avignon to Rome, and even to compel the Visconti to\r\nabandon their opposition to the Papal claims over some of the northern\r\ntowns of Italy. But the first expedition was merely intended to\r\nstrengthen his throne by the kind of prestige which the Papal approval\r\nwas still supposed to give to it; and the second visit was undertaken\r\nin the interests of Italian order and Papal dignity. In short, though\r\nCharles was anxious for Petrarch’s company, and would have liked him\r\nto lecture on literature to the University of Prague, and to the young\r\nWenceslaus, he had no intention of following the poet’s advice in the\r\nweighty concerns of government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF CHARLES IV. NEAR HIS BRIDGE IN PRAGUE.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this general sketch of Charles’s career, it is\r\nnecessary to refer to a project, the character of which may be easily\r\nmisunderstood. Even when freed from Italian influence, and united,\r\nat least in intellectual interests, with Bohemia, the German Empire\r\nmight still be exposed to the disorders arising from the contests of\r\nits princes, especially at the time of the election of the Emperors.\r\nThis evil Charles proposed to remove by making the Imperial crown\r\nhereditary in the House of Luxemburg. One must not judge this scheme as\r\na mere piece of personal ambition. Doubtless there is always something\r\nrepugnant to our ideas of strict honesty in those frequent attempts,\r\nduring the Middle Ages, to turn an elective position to the permanent\r\nadvantage of the family of its accidental occupant. But we must\r\nremember that there is an important difference between the purpose of\r\nCharles IV. and other attempts which appear to have the same character.\r\nWhen, for instance, Rudolf of Hapsburg used his Imperial position to\r\nturn the Counts of Hapsburg into Dukes of Austria; when the Margrave\r\nof Brandenburg made use of his Mastership of the Teutonic knights as a\r\nmeans of uniting East Prussia with Brandenburg; or when the Savoyard\r\nPope Felix used his Papal power to extend the dominions of the House\r\nof Savoy; none of these attempts could have profited any one except\r\nthe ambitious promoters of them. But, if Charles could have made the\r\nGerman Empire hereditary in a House which was already powerful by its\r\nposition in Bohemia, and could at the same time have delivered it from\r\nthe terrible encumbrance of the connection with Italy, many a bitter\r\ncivil war might surely have been spared. His attempt failed; and, from\r\nsome points of view, one may say that it was well that it failed. But a\r\ngreat design cannot be completely judged by its results alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORM MOVEMENT FROM THE DIET OF 1359 TO THE RETIREMENT OF THE\r\nGERMANS FROM THE PRAGUE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n(1359-1409.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMany causes had paved the way for that revolution, both of thought and\r\naction, which marks the fourteenth century. The complete failure of the\r\ncrusades had shaken the faith of the people generally in the leadership\r\nof those princes and nobles who had organised these expeditions.\r\nThe insurrection of “the Shepherds” in France had been one of the\r\nfirst results of this feeling; while the extraordinary performances\r\nof the Flagellants or Scourging Friars showed yet more clearly the\r\nextravagances which the popular discontent might produce.\r\n\r\nNor, in the general whirl of thought and feeling, was it easy to\r\nforesee on which side any new development of this feeling should\r\nbe classed; whether it should be condemned as a source of heresy\r\nand a disturbance of order, or applauded as a revival of stronger\r\nfaith and stricter discipline. The Dominicans and Franciscans,\r\ncalled into existence to combat heresy and to strengthen the Papal\r\npower, were looked upon by the secular clergy as intruders on their\r\nlawful privileges and disturbers of the peace; while the Franciscan\r\nrenunciation of property gradually led them on to the advocacy of\r\ndoctrines, which were at least as inconvenient to Popes and Cardinals\r\nas to the secular nobles.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the way in which anxiety for their temporal\r\npossessions was colouring all the feelings of the defenders of the\r\nChurch, that, throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the\r\nname with which its champions were most eager to brand their opponents,\r\nas indicating the darkest shade of heresy, was the name of “Picard.”\r\nThis word was a corruption of “Beghard,” the title of a Flemish sect,\r\nwhich had been distinguished for its devotion and zeal for prayer, but\r\nwhich had alarmed the rulers of the world by its advocacy of community\r\nof goods.\r\n\r\nThe confusion produced in men’s minds by the failure of the Church’s\r\narmies to recover Palestine, was still further increased by the\r\nretirement of the Popes to Avignon, and at a later time by that schism\r\nin the Papacy which followed the restoration of the Papal rule in Rome;\r\nand, along with the desire for the re-establishment of the unity of the\r\nChurch, there grew the wish for a revival of peace and purity in the\r\ngeneral life of Europe.\r\n\r\nOf all the rulers of the fourteenth century Charles IV. seemed the most\r\nlikely to guide these conflicting movements into channels, which should\r\nbe at once favourable to the champions of the Papacy, and welcome to\r\nthe promoters of peace and purity.\r\n\r\nAs King of Bohemia he had inherited, through his mother’s family,\r\ntraditions of special devotion to the Church; and most of the\r\ncircumstances of his career were of a kind to encourage the hopes of\r\nthe Pope and the clergy. He had been elected to the Imperial throne,\r\nin opposition to the most bitterly anti-papal of Emperors, Louis of\r\nBavaria; he had steadily opposed all the proposals which had been made\r\nto him, to induce him to assert his Imperial authority over the Italian\r\ncities; and he had prefaced the Majestas Carolina with an assertion of\r\nhis adherence to the Catholic faith, and a denunciation of heresy. No\r\ndoubt that clause in the Golden Bull which repudiated the necessity of\r\na Papal sanction to the election of an Emperor, had drawn a protest\r\nfrom the Pope; but this error had surely been more than compensated\r\nfor, by the zeal which Charles had shown for the restoration of the\r\nPope to Rome, and for the maintenance of the Papal authority in Italy.\r\n\r\nIt must, then, have been with a shock of painful surprise that, in\r\n1359, Pope Innocent VI. found himself suddenly opposed by this orthodox\r\nchampion of the Church. The first cause of division had been a demand\r\nof Charles, that the Pope would repeal some decrees which hindered the\r\nEmperor from reforming the discipline of the clergy. Innocent had been\r\nso indignant at this demand, that he had tried to rouse the Electors\r\nagainst the Emperor; but he had wholly failed in that attempt, and had\r\nbeen forced to make some concessions to Charles.\r\n\r\nThe next point of difference was connected with a yet more burning\r\nquestion. Innocent had demanded new tithes from the princes of the\r\nEmpire. Many of them had refused; and now, at an Assembly at Mainz,\r\nthe Papal Legate again raised the question, possibly hoping to obtain\r\nCharles’s support. But the Emperor answered his demand by an expression\r\nof surprise, that the Pope was so much more zealous for collecting\r\nmoney than for reforming the morals of the clergy. Then, turning\r\nsuddenly to the Dean of Mainz, who was wearing a splendid silken robe\r\nornamented with gold, he made him exchange the magnificent dress for\r\nthe simple cloth robe which Charles himself wore; and, as he put on the\r\ngrand dress of the ecclesiastic, he appealed to the spectators to say\r\nif he did not now look more like a knight than a dean. This practical\r\nexhibition of clerical luxury the Emperor followed by a stern rebuke to\r\nthe bishops for not enforcing a more strict decorum of life among the\r\nclergy; and he even threatened to tax their income for the support of\r\nthe royal exchequer.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, unfortunately, there were many nobles who were ready to\r\ntake advantage of the reforming movement to promote their own ends.\r\nThat the clergy should live more simply seemed to these nobles a\r\nmost desirable thing; and to help them to attain so satisfactory a\r\ncondition, they proceeded to plunder their houses, and lay waste their\r\nlands. Such acts were utterly opposed to Charles’s intentions; and he\r\nchecked these outrages so sternly that the Pope was once more forced\r\nto recognise him as his safest and strongest supporter. Perhaps this\r\nlast circumstance made it easier for Charles to carry out his plans\r\nfor reformation in Bohemia. In that kingdom, however, he worked by\r\ndifferent methods, and with somewhat different objects from those at\r\nwhich he had aimed in his German schemes of reformation; for in Bohemia\r\nhe trusted rather to the moral effect which could be produced by great\r\npreachers than to legislation or forcible repression.\r\n\r\nThe first of these preachers, whom the King summoned to Prague, was an\r\nAustrian named Conrad Waldhauser, who began to come prominently forward\r\nin 1360, the year after Charles’s attempt to reform the German clergy.\r\nConrad’s preachings were largely directed against the luxury of women;\r\nbut he also denounced the tyranny of the nobles and their usurious\r\nexactions from the peasantry. His fiercest attacks, however, were aimed\r\nagainst the Mendicant Orders, and specially against their simoniacal\r\nattempts to obtain ecclesiastical offices. It was these attacks that\r\nbrought the greatest danger to the preacher; for the Franciscans were\r\nstill strong in Papal support; and Conrad was summoned before the\r\nLegate to answer a charge of heresy. As both King and Archbishop stood\r\nby the accused, the attempts of his enemies were defeated; and he\r\ncontinued till his death in 1369 to exercise great influence in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut Conrad was a German, and preached, of course, in his native\r\nlanguage; and Charles felt that, if the reformation were really to take\r\nhold of the people, they must be addressed in their own language. He\r\ntherefore brought forward a preacher of a rather different type from\r\nConrad. This was Milic of Kromĕr̆íz̆, a Moravian of rather plebeian\r\norigin. He had early attracted Charles’s attention, and had been\r\nalready appointed to some office about the court in 1350. He had risen\r\nsteadily in the king’s favour, and had been raised in 1363 to one of\r\nthe chief posts in the Chancellery. An ascetic dislike to worldly\r\nhonours now induced him to resign all these offices, in order to become\r\na preacher. He at first retired to a living in a distant town; but,\r\nfinding that the beautiful garden which was attached to the pastor’s\r\nhouse gave him too much pleasure, he returned to Prague, and began\r\nto preach at the Church of St. Nicholas in the Small District, and\r\nafterwards at St. Giles’s in the Old Town.\r\n\r\nAt first his Moravian accent excited some ridicule; but the eloquence\r\nand moral fervour of his preaching soon brought him large audiences;\r\nand he was at last called on to preach three times a day in different\r\nplaces. His horror at the evils of the time was so great that he soon\r\nbegan to prophesy the coming of Antichrist; and, at one time, when\r\nCharles was, as he considered, falling short of his duty, Milic even\r\ndenounced the King as Antichrist. The Archbishop of Prague became\r\nalarmed at this attack, and put Milic in prison; but Charles himself\r\nnever resented the opposition of those whom he respected; and Milic was\r\nset free again. Like so many of the reformers of the time, he had been\r\ngreatly distressed at the retirement of the popes to Avignon; and, when\r\nCharles was trying to persuade Pope Urban V. to return to Rome, Milic\r\nwent to Rome, and there also delivered his sermons on the coming of\r\nAntichrist. The Roman authorities were alarmed, and Milic was again\r\nthrown into prison; but, when the Pope actually returned to Rome, he\r\nwas again set free and sent back to Prague.\r\n\r\nHe now abandoned his preaching on Antichrist, and restricted it to the\r\nadvocacy of moral reforms. The death of Conrad Waldhauser made Milic\r\nthe undisputed leader among the preachers of Prague; and, while the\r\nTeyn Church became the chief scene of his labours, he also prepared\r\ndiscourses for a preacher in another church. His most successful work\r\nwas in reclaiming fallen women. Of these he had sometimes more than\r\nthree hundred under his charge, whom he had rescued from an evil life;\r\nand he not only built a penitentiary for their residence, but he\r\npersuaded the ladies of Prague to give them places in their service.\r\nCharles nobly seconded his efforts by pulling down a notorious house of\r\nill-fame, and building a church on the site of it.\r\n\r\nBut Milic’s fierce denunciations of the sins of the clergy continued to\r\nstir up enemies against him; and in 1374 Gregory XI., who had returned\r\nto Avignon, sent a warning to the King and Archbishop, as well as\r\nto the Bishops of Breslau, Cracow, and Olmütz against the danger of\r\nMilic’s teaching. He went to Avignon to defend himself; but, though he\r\nsucceeded in satisfying the Pope and cardinals of his innocence, he\r\nnever returned to Bohemia; for he was seized with an illness while at\r\nAvignon, and died there on St. Peter’s Day, 1374.\r\n\r\nMilic had been assisted by his humble origin in gaining the sympathies\r\nof the poor; but even more alarming to the Germans who had gathered in\r\nPrague was Milic’s follower Thomas of S̆títný. He was descended from a\r\nnoble family, and had been one of the earliest pupils of the University\r\nof Prague. He was thus able to give a more permanent literary reform to\r\nthe teachings of the reformers. Nor did he confine himself, as Conrad\r\nand Milic had done, to efforts after moral improvement; for he grappled\r\nalso with those more subtle questions of theology which were coming at\r\nthat time into prominence. Master Eckhard, the founder of the Mystics,\r\nhad been appointed at one time as Vicar-General of Bohemia. He had no\r\ndoubt gained considerable influence in that country; and S̆títný’s\r\nutterances, especially about Faith and Love, were coloured by the\r\nteaching of the mystical school.\r\n\r\nBut the chief point of objection urged against S̆títný by his enemies\r\nwas that he wrote in Bohemian. Since the time of Otto of Brandenburg,\r\nthe German language had gained much ground in the town councils of\r\nBohemia; and the foundation of the Prague University had brought a rush\r\nof German scholars to that city. The arrangements for the votings of\r\nthe Nations had secured a predominance to the German element in the\r\nUniversity; for not only did the Bavarian and Saxon nations represent\r\nalmost exclusively the German influence; but even in the districts from\r\nwhich the Polish nation was drawn, there was a large German admixture.\r\nOf course those students who had come from a great distance had given\r\na special proof of their genuine interest in learning; and they\r\nnaturally looked upon themselves as the representatives of a higher\r\nculture than that of the ordinary townsfolk of Prague. Hence it came\r\nthat the leading doctors of the University inclined to consider German\r\nrather than Bohemian as the suitable language for men of culture,\r\nespecially when writing on abstruse subjects; and this feeling they\r\nwere all the more anxious to assert, because, in the general stir\r\nof thought, a native Bohemian literature was beginning to attract\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nCharles himself had studied the language carefully, had favoured the\r\nrevival of the Slavonic ritual, and, as already mentioned, had chosen\r\nMilic of Kromĕr̆íz̆ in order to encourage the popular preaching of\r\nBohemian. Under these circumstances, satirists, poets, and historians\r\nbegan to write in their native language; and the Masters of the\r\nUniversity felt that they would have a hard struggle before they could\r\ndenationalise Bohemia. They were therefore especially irritated when\r\na cultivated nobleman like S̆títný insisted on discussing the most\r\nprofound and subtle questions of theology in the Bohemian language; and\r\nthis alarm was certainly not diminished when they found that he coupled\r\nthese speculations with denunciations of the corruptions of the clergy,\r\nthe tyrannies of nobles, and even the injustices of kings. Thus, then,\r\na general movement for the reform of morals and the improvement of the\r\nclergy was more and more connecting itself with the struggles between\r\nGerman and Bohemian for the supremacy of their respective languages. It\r\nis conceivable that even so bitter a controversy as this might have\r\nbeen guided into more peaceable channels by a king who combined zeal\r\nfor the Church, hearty appreciation of German learning, and a real\r\nenthusiasm for Bohemian traditions. But whether or not Charles would\r\nhave been equal to such a task, there can be little doubt that his\r\ndeath in 1378, and the accession of his son Wenceslaus IV., did prepare\r\nthe way for the more violent explosion which followed.\r\n\r\nA great name is, in any case, a very dangerous inheritance; and when\r\nthat inheritance implies an obligation on the heir to carry out a\r\ngreat work begun by his predecessor, the tradition generally involves\r\nfailure and disgrace. In Wenceslaus, as in so many sons of great\r\nrulers, some of the qualities which had secured his father’s success\r\nwere conspicuously wanting. Charles had known when to insist, and when\r\nto abstain from insisting, on the reforms which he had most at heart.\r\nHe had known how far to go in the punishment of offences, and when to\r\npardon graciously; above all, he had known how to respect, and even to\r\nutilise, the abilities of honest opponents. None of these lessons of\r\nstatesmanship could Wenceslaus ever learn; he was absolutely without\r\nself-restraint or sense of proportion; and, consequently, though his\r\naims were generally those of a wise and patriotic ruler, he frequently\r\nused the methods of a cruel tyrant.\r\n\r\nYet, with all these grave defects, Wenceslaus was far from being the\r\nunscrupulous and self-indulgent monster which his enemies delighted to\r\npaint him. In the early years of his reign his policy was wise and\r\nenlightened, though, even then, it was marked occasionally by that\r\nhastiness and uncertainty which belonged to his passionate temperament.\r\nBut, in the difficult position in which he was placed, every step\r\nwhich he took was a dangerous one, and was certain to encounter fierce\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe first work which his Imperial position imposed on him was the\r\neffort to restore order in the Church, by putting an end to the\r\ndivisions between the rival Popes. In this point he wisely followed the\r\npolicy of his father, and supported the claims of Pope Urban VI., who\r\nwas actually living at Rome. The assembly of German princes accepted\r\nthe decision of the Emperor; and at Prague he received the support both\r\nof the University and the Archbishop. But a difficulty at once arose.\r\nThe Pope of Avignon was, as a matter of course, supported by the King\r\nof France; and the old traditions of the House of Luxemburg were in\r\nfavour of friendly relations with the French kings. Greatly, therefore,\r\nto Urban’s indignation, Wenceslaus insisted on renewing his alliance\r\nwith Charles in the next year to that in which he had recognised Urban\r\nas pope; he also refused to support that Pope in his quarrels with the\r\nHouse of Anjou for the possession of Sicily; and an even more vital\r\ncause of difference between Urban and Wenceslaus was the determination\r\nof the King to assert his authority over the clergy of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIt was in these quarrels with his clergy that Wenceslaus first showed\r\nthat tendency to violent methods, which undermined his own power and\r\ninflicted great injury on the cause of Church reformation. In 1385 he\r\nwas involved in a quarrel with the Dean of Breslau. It appeared that a\r\ncask of beer sent to the dean by his brother had been intercepted by\r\nthe Town Council, on the ground that no foreign beer should be admitted\r\ninto the town. The dean, therefore, laid an interdict upon Breslau.\r\nWenceslaus came to inquire into the matter, and demanded that the\r\nreligious services should be celebrated, as long at least as he stayed\r\nin the town. The dean refused; and thereupon Wenceslaus banished the\r\nwhole Chapter of Breslau from the town for two years, and handed over a\r\nlarge part of their property to the citizens.\r\n\r\nBut the most dangerous of his clerical enemies was the Archbishop of\r\nPrague, John of Jenstein. The Archbishop, himself of noble birth, had\r\nhad a quarrel with the Marshal of the Court about certain rights of\r\nfishing on the Elbe; and, in asserting these rights, he had destroyed\r\na weir which the marshal had made. Wenceslaus took the side of his\r\nofficial, and demanded that the Archbishop should make compensation.\r\nJenstein refused; and Wenceslaus thereupon confiscated his property.\r\nBut these acts, however arbitrary, might possibly have been forgotten,\r\nhad they not been followed by a more celebrated quarrel.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1393 the Vice Chamberlain, who was the chief judge of the\r\nroyal law-court, had put to death two priests. It is uncertain what\r\ntheir offences were; but the Archbishop claimed them as under his\r\njurisdiction, and asserted that they should only have been tried in\r\nhis court. About the same time, the Archbishop had wished to seize\r\nand punish certain Jews, who, after being baptised as Christians, had\r\nrelapsed into Judaism. As the Jews were under the special protection\r\nof the King’s court, the Vice Chamberlain refused to surrender them\r\nto the Archbishop. For these two acts of opposition to his power, the\r\nArchbishop excommunicated the Vice Chamberlain, and denounced him as a\r\nheretic. The King received this news with great indignation; and his\r\nanger was still further quickened by a more personal insult. Not long\r\nbefore this time, he had recommended a special favourite to a bishopric\r\nin Pomerania; but, as the rulers of Pomerania had resisted the\r\nappointment, Wenceslaus had been unable to establish his claim. He was\r\ntherefore resolved to endow a new bishopric in Bohemia, to which his\r\nnominee could be appointed; and the death of the abbot of a monastery\r\nin Prague suggested to the King the advisability of suppressing the\r\nmonastery in order to obtain funds for the endowment of his new\r\nbishopric. The Archbishop opposed the creation of this bishopric as a\r\ndiminution of his own diocese; and he may very likely have considered\r\nthe suppression of the monastery as an act of injustice. In defiance,\r\ntherefore, of the King’s order, the Archbishop directed the monks to\r\nproceed to the election of a new abbot, which they accordingly did.\r\nWenceslaus hastened back to Prague in great indignation; and the\r\nArchbishop fled to the Castle of Raudnice. The King claimed this as\r\na royal castle; and he therefore considered the Archbishop’s flight\r\nthither as conclusive proof of an organised conspiracy against the\r\nroyal authority. Finding that Jenstein would not return to Prague, the\r\nking summoned before him the two chief officials of the archbishopric,\r\nPuchnic, and John Nepomuc. When they persistently refused to give\r\nany evidence against the Archbishop, Wenceslaus ordered them to be\r\ntortured. As they continued to defy him, he had them burnt on the hand;\r\nand, at last, fixing upon Nepomuc, either as the most defiant or the\r\nmost important of his victims, he ordered him to be bound hand and\r\nfoot, and thrown into the Moldau.\r\n\r\nThis crime was to produce even greater triumphs for the clerical party\r\nthan those which had followed the murder of Becket; and Wenceslaus\r\nseems to have repented of it almost as soon as it was committed. He\r\nset Puchnic free, and gave him money compensation for his sufferings;\r\nand he recalled Jenstein to Prague. The Archbishop came; a sort of\r\nreconciliation was patched up, but its unreality was evident from the\r\nfirst. Jenstein secretly fled to Rome and demanded that the Pope should\r\nlay an interdict on Bohemia. At the same time all the clergy appealed\r\nto Sigismund, King of Hungary, the brother of Wenceslaus, to come to\r\nBohemia to avenge their wrongs. Strange to say, this second appeal was\r\nthe only one which produced a result. The new pope, Boniface IX., was\r\neager to obtain the support of Wenceslaus, and therefore took his part\r\nagainst the Archbishop. Sigismund, on the contrary, was always ready to\r\nplot against his brother; and he easily found allies among the Bohemian\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nFor, though the offences of Wenceslaus against the clergy had\r\nattracted the most attention, his injuries to the secular nobles had\r\nbeen not less keenly felt. In his desire to weaken the more powerful\r\nmembers of the aristocracy, he had formed a private Council among the\r\nsmall nobility and citizens; and, by their help, he had opposed and\r\ncounteracted the greater nobles. He had further offended their sense of\r\ndignity and decorum by playing the part of Haroun Alraschid, and paying\r\nsecret visits to the houses of his various subjects, to discover any\r\noffences which might have escaped the notice of the ordinary tribunals.\r\nThis conduct had made him so unpopular with the nobles that, even\r\nbefore Sigismund’s intervention, they had formed a conspiracy against\r\nhim. The ostensible leader of this conspiracy was the king’s cousin\r\nJodok, the Margrave of Moravia; but perhaps its most powerful member\r\nwas Henry of Rosenberg. This nobleman, like so many of his time, was\r\na distinguished patron of literature and art; though his influence in\r\nsuch a movement was no doubt due to the more material considerations of\r\nhis high rank, wide connections, and large territorial influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KRUMOV, ONE OF THE CHIEF SEATS OF THE ROSENBERGS.]\r\n\r\nThe Rosenbergs were the members of a very powerful group of families\r\ncalled the Vítkovici, who were the practical rulers of the south and\r\nsouth-east of Bohemia. There they exercised an authority which was\r\nlittle short of regal. They had bodies of soldiers at their command;\r\nthey coined money and built fortresses at their pleasure. They\r\nprofessed to trace their origin to the Italian family of the Orsini;\r\nand they had played almost as important a part in the thirteenth\r\ncentury as the Vrs̆ovici had played in the earlier history of Bohemia.\r\nOf these Vítkovici the Rosenbergs were the most important branch;\r\nand their name shows that they had to a large extent Germanised\r\nthemselves, even in the time of Ottakar. They had strengthened their\r\nposition in Bohemia by founding towns and monasteries, planting woods,\r\nand building churches; and their fishponds became so important that\r\nthe town of Prague was mainly supplied from them. So deeply-rooted\r\nwas their power that the signs of its past greatness are visible even\r\nat the present day, in the towns of Krumov, Tr̆ebon̆, Prachatice,\r\nthe monastery of Hohenfurt, and the castle and village of Rosenberg.\r\nIt will easily be understood that the leader of so powerful a clan\r\nwould deeply resent such attempts as those of Wenceslaus to infringe\r\nthe privileges of the nobility, and to call men of lower rank to his\r\nCouncils. Nor did the nobles rely solely on Bohemian support. Jodok of\r\nMoravia had taken counsel with the Duke of Austria and the Margrave of\r\nMeissen, who were always ready for any opportunity of weakening the\r\nBohemian kingdom. Such a combination as this would have been dangerous\r\neven to Charles; and Wenceslaus was quite unable to stand against it.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were quickly ready for action; and in the year 1394, as\r\nWenceslaus was on his way to Prague, he was seized by Jodok and his\r\nfollowers, and imprisoned in the Castle of Prague. The demands of the\r\ninsurgent nobles were now formulated. They insisted that Wenceslaus\r\nshould leave them in possession of all the fortresses that had been\r\npledged to them, and that he should appoint Jodok as his Viceroy in\r\nBohemia. Duke John of Görlitz, the youngest brother of Wenceslaus,\r\nhastened to the rescue of the king; and, though Jodok succeeded in\r\ncarrying off his prisoner to Austria, John was welcomed by the\r\ncitizens of Prague, who swore to recognise him as the administrator of\r\nthe country till the King should once more be at liberty to act.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the princes of the Empire had become indignant at the\r\ntreatment of their Emperor; and they persuaded the Duke of Austria\r\nto set him free. Wenceslaus returned, embittered and suspicious, to\r\nhis kingdom; and his brother John soon found that the position of\r\nliberator and peacemaker was a very difficult one. The rebel nobles\r\nhad fled to Austria, whence they made raids upon their native country;\r\nJohn attempted to make peace between the king and the insurgents; but,\r\nwhen Wenceslaus found that John had mistaken the extent of the powers\r\nentrusted to him by the rebels, he accused his brother of deceiving\r\nhim, and deprived him of his vice-royalty. Many of the citizens of\r\nPrague had become attached to John, and they remonstrated against\r\nhis deposition. Thereupon Wenceslaus deposed all the members of the\r\nTown Council, appointed a new Council in their place, and then went\r\nthrough the town, accompanied by an executioner, who cut off the heads\r\nof the King’s leading opponents at the doors of their houses. In his\r\ndiscontent with John, Wenceslaus now appealed to his brother Sigismund.\r\nSigismund came, and John soon after died, not without suspicion of\r\npoison. Sigismund at once persuaded Wenceslaus to recognise him as his\r\nheir if he should die without sons, to appoint a Council of the nobles,\r\nand to promise not to introduce any changes in the government without\r\nthe consent of that Council.\r\n\r\nThe hollowness of the peace which followed was very quickly seen. When\r\nJodok came to see the king at Carlstein in the same year, Wenceslaus\r\nwas so carried away by the recollection of his cousin’s insults, that\r\nhe had him arrested and imprisoned. Then, suddenly remembering the\r\ntreaty of peace, he set him free again. But Jodok thought more of his\r\nimprisonment than of his liberation; and, though nominally reconciled,\r\nthe King and the Margrave remained enemies throughout life.\r\n\r\nThe Bohemian quarrels had, in the meantime, given opportunity for the\r\nintrigues of Wenceslaus’s rivals in the Empire. That jealousy which\r\nthe Electors always felt of the concentration of the Imperial power in\r\nany one family, had been for some time directed against the House of\r\nLuxemburg. Charles’s extension of Bohemian territory, by the addition\r\nof German lands, had caused much suspicion and dislike. But his\r\ncombination of vigour and self-restraint, and his complete hold over\r\nhis Bohemian subjects, had prevented the intriguers from making any\r\nhead during his lifetime. Now, however, the quarrels of Wenceslaus with\r\nhis subjects had given a double opportunity to his German opponents;\r\nfor while, on the one hand, they could point to his long detention\r\nin Bohemia as a proof of his indifference to Imperial affairs, on\r\nthe other hand, the disaffection of his Bohemian subjects supplied a\r\nhopeful weapon for undermining his power.\r\n\r\nHis two leading enemies were Rupert, Count Palatine of the Rhine, who\r\naimed at the Imperial dignity, and the Archbishop of Mainz, who had\r\nsecured his see by a promise to support the intrigues of Rupert. These\r\nconspirators succeeded in winning to their side Pope Boniface IX. This\r\nPope had indeed been at first friendly to Wenceslaus; but he had been\r\noffended by the readiness with which the King of Bohemia had listened\r\nto the French proposals for the election of a new Pope in place of the\r\ntwo rival claimants to the Holy See. Under various pretexts, the Duke\r\nof Saxony and the Archbishops of Trier and Köln were drawn into the\r\nconspiracy; and so, in February, 1400, the Electors met at Frankfort\r\nand resolved to choose a new Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible grounds for this deposition were mainly of a\r\nnegative kind. Wenceslaus was charged with failing to procure a\r\npeaceful settlement of the affairs of the Church, and with paying no\r\nheed to those wars which were disturbing the Empire. Though Wenceslaus\r\nmight have found ample excuse for these failures, he could not\r\ndirectly deny them; but the other charges were either false or grossly\r\nexaggerated. One of them, however, must be quoted, since it has so much\r\nbearing on the troubles which were approaching in the Bohemian kingdom.\r\nThis was a charge that he “had drowned, burnt, and otherwise murdered\r\nand tortured reverend prelates and priests.” This accusation shows\r\nthat the murder of Nepomuc was to be represented, at the pleasure of\r\nWenceslaus’s enemies, either as part of a general massacre of priests,\r\nor as the cruel execution of one specially righteous man.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, as the champion of Holy Church against its\r\noppressor, that Rupert was chosen Holy Roman Emperor. In this character\r\nhe at once marched into Bohemia and won the support of Jodok and\r\nthe discontented nobles. Again Wenceslaus was forced to make terms\r\nwith his enemies; and again Sigismund was called in and appointed\r\nViceroy. But Sigismund gained favour with no party. Jodok and his\r\nfriends resented the power entrusted to him; the citizens of Bohemia\r\ncomplained of the heavy taxes which he laid upon them; and Wenceslaus\r\nresisted his proposal that he should counteract the schemes of Rupert\r\nby accompanying Sigismund to Rome, and by accepting the Imperial crown\r\nfrom the Pope. Finding his plans thwarted, Sigismund suddenly seized\r\nupon his brother, and carried him off as prisoner to Vienna. From this\r\nimprisonment Wenceslaus succeeded in escaping in 1403; and, on his\r\nreturn to Prague, he was welcomed as the liberator of Bohemia from\r\nSigismund.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the reform movement had been approaching a crisis. The\r\nteacher who, after the death of Milic, had gained most influence in\r\nthe country, was a Bohemian nobleman named Matthias of Janov. He had\r\nnot devoted himself so exclusively as Conrad and Milic had done to the\r\ndenunciation of moral abuses, but had also attacked practices like the\r\nworship of images and saints; and he had been the first to bring before\r\nthe public the question which was afterwards to be so interesting to\r\nBohemians, the granting of the cup to the laity in the Holy Communion.\r\nBut though this latter fact gives Matthias a kind of historic interest,\r\nhe seems to have been in the main a source of weakness to the cause\r\nwhich he defended. Never wholly disinterested in his objects, he soon\r\nflinched from the attacks of the rulers of the Church; and in 1389 he\r\nformally recanted his reforming doctrines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE OF HUSINEC.]\r\n\r\nAlong with the movement for ecclesiastical reform, the Bohemian\r\nnational revival had been steadily making way; and the opposition of\r\nthe German party had served to deepen the zeal of the reformers for\r\nthe encouragement of the Bohemian languages. A most important link\r\nwas formed in 1396 between the linguistic and the moral revival. In\r\nthat year a man named John of Milheim founded a chapel which was to\r\nbe entirely devoted to Bohemian preaching, in order, as its founder\r\nexpressed it, “that the Word of God should not be fettered, and that\r\nBohemian preachers should not be obliged to go from house to house.”\r\nThe new foundation was to be called the Bethlehem Chapel, and was to\r\nbe consecrated to the Holy Innocents. Strange to say, the first three\r\npreachers seem to have been somewhat hesitating and uncertain in their\r\ntendencies; and it was not till 1402 that the appointment of Jan Hus\r\nsecured to the Bethlehem Chapel a special position in the history of\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUSINEC, SHOWING COTTAGE WHERE HUS WAS BORN.]\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 1369, Jan Hus was born at Husinec, in the south of Bohemia.\r\nThis village lies in a deep valley among pine-covered hills, and the\r\ntiny cottage in which Hus was born still remains. As his parents were\r\npoor, he was forced to support himself in his early days by singing in\r\nchurches; and even after he had been sent to the University he was in\r\nsuch straits that he was at one time compelled to live on dry bread.\r\nNevertheless he made steady way in the University; two years after\r\ntaking his degree of Master of Arts, he was appointed examiner; in\r\n1401 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and in 1403 he was\r\nchosen Rector of the University. He had thrown himself from the first\r\ninto the national cause; and he denounced, from his pulpit in the\r\nBethlehem Chapel, the expedition of the rebel nobles against Prague.\r\nHe showed great zeal in giving new literary expression to the Bohemian\r\nlanguage, and expunged from it the Germanisms which had crept into it.\r\nHe also persistently opposed the encroachments of the Germans in the\r\ngovernment of the University. At the same time he always declared that\r\nhe would prefer a good German to a bad Bohemian, even if the latter\r\nwere his brother.\r\n\r\nIt was in this same year, 1403, that the national reform movement began\r\nto connect itself generally with questions of ritual and doctrine.\r\nThe exact point in history at which the doctrines of Wyclif gained\r\ninfluence in Bohemia, is very difficult to fix. The marriage of\r\nAnna, the sister of Wenceslaus, in 1381, to Richard II. of England,\r\nundoubtedly produced close contact between the two countries. It is\r\nclear, from his own statements, that Wyclif was much impressed by the\r\nforwardness of the Bohemians in religious knowledge, and specially by\r\nthe fact that they had already translated the Bible into their native\r\ntongue. But, although this experience much affected the work of the\r\nEnglish Reformer, it seems doubtful how soon he began to repay the\r\ndebt, by imparting his ideas to Bohemia. Apparently, neither Matthias\r\nof Janov nor Thomas of S̆títný were deeply acquainted with Wyclif’s\r\nworks; and neither his condemnation in 1382 nor his death in 1385 seem\r\nto have excited much interest in Bohemia. Yet, on the other hand, it\r\nis evident, from the scene which is about to be described, that both\r\nHus and some of his followers must have given considerable attention to\r\nWyclif’s writings.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, the enemies of the English Reformer who first\r\npublicly called the attention of the Bohemians to his works. A German\r\nSilesian, named Hubner, had selected from Wyclif’s writings forty-five\r\npropositions which he asked the University of Prague to condemn.\r\nThe period of Hus’s Rectorship seems to have come to an end before\r\nthis proposal was made; and on May 28, 1403, the new Rector of the\r\nUniversity convoked an assembly of the Masters of Arts, and laid\r\nbefore them the propositions which Hubner had compiled. Hus at once\r\ncame forward to answer Hubner, but he based his opposition entirely on\r\nthe inaccuracy of the summaries laid before them. He referred to the\r\nburning alive of certain adulterators of saffron, which had recently\r\ntaken place in Prague; and he declared that such a fate was better\r\ndeserved by these adulterators of books. But some of his followers went\r\nmuch further. Stephen Pálec̆ threw a book of Wyclif’s on the table,\r\ndeclaring that he was willing to defend it against all attacks; and\r\nStanislaus of Znaym (Znojem) offered to prove that none of the articles\r\nattributed to Wyclif were heretical. This statement so offended some\r\nof the older Masters that they at once left the room; but, in spite\r\nof their retirement, a majority of those who remained condemned the\r\nforty-five Articles of Wyclif, and decided that they should not be\r\ntaught in Bohemia. The influence of Wenceslaus was, for the moment,\r\nthrown on the side of reform; and, after the death of the Archbishop of\r\nPrague, he appointed to the see an ex-soldier named Zbynĕk Zajíc, who\r\nhad a great dislike to many of the impostures which had been encouraged\r\nby the clergy. The new Archbishop at once sent Hus to inquire into\r\nseveral fictitious miracles which had recently become notorious in the\r\ncountry; and, by his help, these abuses were checked for the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAN HUS.]\r\n\r\nBut, while Hus was zealous against every form of moral corruption, he\r\nhad by no means committed himself to those doctrines for which Wyclif\r\nhad been branded as a heretic. At the same time he had read and studied\r\nmany of the purely philosophical works of the English Reformer; and he\r\nexpressed his belief that much good was to be learned from them. With\r\nthe Englishman’s hatred of moral corruption Hus sympathised yet more\r\nwarmly; while the national character of the two movements naturally\r\nroused a sympathy between their respective supporters. The revival of\r\nthe English language, as a literary expression of thought, had received\r\nconsiderable impulse from Wyclif’s translation of the Bible; and the\r\nuse of English, rather than Latin or Norman-French, in theological\r\nwritings became one of the notes of the Lollard movement. In this\r\ntendency Hus could not fail to observe the likeness to his own efforts\r\nto maintain the Bohemian language against the inroads of the Germans.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations produced in Hus so strong a personal\r\nadmiration for Wyclif that he expressed a wish that his soul might be\r\nwith his. The combination of such a wish with the rejection of many of\r\nWyclif’s doctrines as heretical, was utterly unintelligible to most of\r\nthe contemporaries of Hus. This pious expression of moral sympathy was\r\nnaturally connected by many with the attacks which Stanislaus of Znojem\r\nwas at the same time making on the doctrine of Transubstantiation; and,\r\nconsequently, the rashness of Hus’s followers, coupled with his own\r\nexpressions of personal feeling, caused him to be branded as a heretic,\r\nwith regard to doctrines about which he held the orthodox belief.\r\n\r\nBut the opposition to the reform movement could not long be confined\r\nto the masters of the University of Prague. In 1405 Pope Innocent\r\nVII. became alarmed at the progress of heresy, and issued a Bull\r\nagainst the doctrines of Wyclif. In deference to this denunciation,\r\nWenceslaus ordered an inquiry into these doctrines; and Archbishop\r\nZbynĕk became even more excited on the subject. On May 14, 1408, even\r\nthe Bohemian nation in the University consented to hold a meeting for\r\nthe examination of Wyclif’s books; but they could only be induced to\r\ncome to the harmless conclusion that the Articles of Wyclif should not\r\nbe taught in any heretical sense, and that his Dialogus and Trialogus\r\nshould not be studied by members of the University before they had\r\ntaken their degree. Such a decision could not satisfy the Archbishop;\r\nand, in June, 1408, he issued a new decree forbidding the clergy to\r\npreach against Transubstantiation. This decree was soon followed by a\r\ndemand that all who possessed copies of Wyclif’s books should surrender\r\nthem to the Archbishop; and the majority of the University obeyed this\r\ncommand, only five students refusing.\r\n\r\nHus had openly expressed his dislike of some of the prosecutions, by\r\nwhich the Archbishop attempted to enforce some of his prohibitions;\r\nand such a protest from so prominent a reformer could not be allowed\r\nto pass unnoticed at such a crisis. So, early in 1408, the clergy of\r\nPrague presented to the archbishop certain articles against Hus. Most\r\nof these are concerned with his denunciations of the pecuniary greed of\r\nthe clergy; but they also include a reference to his wish that his soul\r\nmight be with Wyclif. For the moment, indeed, these complaints produced\r\nlittle result; for just at this time Archbishop Zajíc himself announced\r\nthat, after inquiry, he could find no heresy in Bohemia. Moreover, it\r\nwas unavoidable that this smaller controversy should be lost sight\r\nof, for a time, in the apparently larger issue of the reunion of\r\nChristendom under one Pope.\r\n\r\nThe division of the Papacy between Rome and Avignon had begun to cause\r\nsuch a scandal in the Church that a new Council was held necessary for\r\nthe restoration of order and unity. Wenceslaus saw in the meeting of\r\nthis Council an opportunity for recovering the position of which he had\r\nbeen deprived. He had never admitted the legality of his deposition\r\nfrom the Imperial throne; and, since only a part of the Electors had\r\nsanctioned that step, he had plausible grounds for disputing its\r\nvalidity. When, then, the Council of Pisa proposed to deal with the\r\nPapal Schism, Wenceslaus consented to send ambassadors to that Council,\r\non condition that they should be recognised as the representatives of\r\nthe Holy Roman Emperor. To secure the consent of the Council to this\r\nproposal, Wenceslaus readily accepted the decision of that body, that,\r\nas a preparatory step to the Unity of the Church, the two rival Popes\r\nshould be required to resign; and he forbade his subjects to recognise\r\nthe authority of either Gregory XII. or his rival till the Council\r\nshould have decided on their claims. This demand at once produced a new\r\nline of division between the contending parties in the Bohemian Church.\r\nHus and his friends had welcomed the Council of Pisa, as a possible\r\nmeans of accomplishing the reforms which they desired; and they\r\nmade no difficulty about approving the deposition of the two Popes.\r\nThe Archbishop, however, and the great body of the Bohemian clergy,\r\nmaintained that they were bound by their allegiance to Gregory XII.;\r\nand in this view the three foreign “Nations” in the University eagerly\r\nsupported them.\r\n\r\nThis division of opinion at once brought to a head that desire for\r\nreasserting their national independence which the Bohemians had so\r\nlong cherished. The dislike of being swamped in their own capital by\r\nforeigners had been steadily growing in the minds of the Bohemians.\r\nThis feeling had been at first expressed in complaints about the\r\nrise of prices and the overcrowding of the city; but it had gained a\r\nmuch greater intensity when the native population realised that the\r\nsupremacy of their language in their own country was at stake. The\r\nresistance of the Germans to the demands of Wenceslaus enabled the\r\nReformers to join their movement for national independence with the\r\nassertion of the royal authority; and, as a means of accomplishing both\r\nthese ends, they proposed that the Bohemian Nation should in future\r\nhave three votes in the election of University officials, while each\r\nof the three foreign “Nations” should be still limited to one vote.\r\nWenceslaus had already made some concessions to the national party\r\nin the University; and they naturally thought that he would at once\r\napprove of a concession which would tend to strengthen his hands in his\r\nstruggle against Gregory XII.\r\n\r\nTo their great surprise, however, they at first met with a rebuff.\r\nWenceslaus was desirous of recovering his position as Emperor; and for\r\nthat he needed German support. He also wished to appear as the orthodox\r\nchampion of the Church; and a recent event had brought home to him the\r\ndanger into which the Bohemian Reformers were running, in this respect.\r\nStephen Pálec̆ and Stanislaus of Znojem had been sent as commissioners\r\nto the Council of Pisa; on their way thither they had been arrested\r\nat Bologna and imprisoned as heretics. This so alarmed the king, that\r\nwhen the Bohemian Deputation waited on him at Kutna Hora, he not only\r\nrejected their proposals, but sharply rebuked Hus and his friends for\r\nbringing discredit on the nation by tainting them with heresy.\r\n\r\nConsistency of purpose, however, was never one of the virtues\r\nof Wenceslaus. A Bohemian nobleman of the name of Lobkovic had\r\nconsiderable influence with the king; and he was a strong champion of\r\nHus and his party. He pointed out to Wenceslaus that those who proposed\r\nthis reform at the University were the supporters of the king’s policy\r\nin the Council of Pisa. Queen Sophia, with whom Hus had already become\r\na favourite, no doubt used her influence in the same direction. The\r\nking was convinced that his interests were, for the time, on the\r\nside of the Reformers; and, in January, 1409, he issued the desired\r\ndecree which granted three votes to the Bohemian Nation in University\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nBut the powerful German party did not yield without a struggle. They\r\npleaded that their oaths as Masters of Arts bound them to maintain the\r\nsettlement made by Charles IV.; and they pointed out that that Emperor\r\nhad intended to make his University the centre of all the learning\r\nof the Empire. Finally they suggested that, if the Bohemian Nation\r\nobjected to be swamped by them, it ought to separate from them and have\r\na council, tribunal, and elections of its own.\r\n\r\nOf these arguments, the first may be fairly dismissed as one of those\r\npieces of ill-tempered rhetoric which are usually thrust forward on\r\nsuch occasions. If an oath to maintain the laws of an association\r\nimplies an opposition to any possible change in those laws, there\r\ncan be few corporations in the world which are not deeply tainted\r\nwith perjury. But the second argument, which appealed to the wishes\r\nand intentions of Charles IV., had undoubtedly some plausibility,\r\nespecially when one considers that the University was only sixty years\r\nold. An answer to this objection could, however, be easily found by\r\nthe Bohemians. Though Charles IV. had no doubt desired to make the\r\nUniversity the centre of the Empire, other words of his could be quoted\r\nto show that he had also intended that his Foundation should secure\r\nspecial advantages to the Bohemians.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was, that Charles’s idea, however grand, was\r\nself-contradictory; and, while inconsistent schemes may work very\r\nwell, as long as all who are interested in them wish them to do so,\r\nthey must fall to pieces at once if they are administered by two\r\nantagonistic parties with directly opposite ideals about the welfare of\r\nthe institution. Charles had undoubtedly wished, as the Germans said,\r\nto make Prague an intellectual centre for Europe; he had also desired,\r\nas the Bohemians said, to call out the national life and encourage the\r\nnational literature of Bohemia. It now appeared that these two objects\r\nwere incompatible; and the question was, which must yield to the other.\r\nCharles IV. was a great statesman; but, as in the case of so many great\r\nmen, the effect which he ultimately produced was precisely the contrary\r\nof that which he desired. He had wished to found a University, which\r\nshould gratify the feelings both of Bohemians and Germans, and be a\r\ncentre of unity and peace to the Empire. He had, instead, given an\r\nimpulse to life, movement, and struggle, which was to overthrow many\r\nabuses which he condemned, but also to drag down in their fall much\r\nwhich he desired to maintain.\r\n\r\nFinding that their arguments were of no avail, the Germans devoted\r\nthemselves to more practical forms of obstruction. They insisted on\r\ndisregarding the decree of the King and on voting in the old fashion\r\nat the next election of the Examiners. The Bohemians resisted this\r\nattempt; and the consequence was that no examination took place. A\r\nsimilar dispute arose about the election of the Deans of Faculties; and\r\na similar result followed. It was obvious that the continuance of this\r\nstruggle must end in the destruction of the work of the University.\r\nMoreover, whatever doubts Wenceslaus might have on other subjects, he\r\nwas quite clear about the duty of enforcing his own decrees. So, on\r\nMay 9, 1409, he summoned an extraordinary meeting of the University,\r\nat which he appointed a new Rector and a new Dean of Arts on his own\r\nauthority. The Germans, finding further resistance hopeless, resolved\r\nto abandon the struggle; and, on May 16th, several thousand German\r\nstudents left Prague for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE RETIREMENT OF THE GERMANS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PRAGUE TO THE\r\nDEATH OF HUS.\r\n\r\n(1409-1415.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of German supremacy in the Bohemian University has been\r\nconsidered by both sides to mark a great crisis in the history of\r\nBohemia. The national character, which had been stamped at so early a\r\ntime on the reforming movement, now became more visible to the world\r\nat large, and at the same time more exclusive and defiant. Nor was\r\nits effect on the life and death of Hus less notable. When he became\r\nrecognised as the most complete embodiment of the principles of the\r\nBohemian Reformation, his German enemies naturally fixed upon him as\r\nthe chief actor in this important stage of the movement; and wild\r\ncharges of violence and intimidation towards the Germans helped to\r\nincrease the hostility which had been roused by the suspicion of heresy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it seems clear enough that, though Hus ultimately\r\nrejoiced in the change produced by the German secession, he had yet\r\ntaken but a secondary and hesitating part in producing the change\r\nitself. On returning from Kuttenberg (Kutna Hora), after Wenceslaus’s\r\nfirst rejection of this proposal, Hus, disappointed and anxious, was\r\nseized with illness; and, while worn with suffering, he asked a friend\r\nwhether, after all, the change was a just one. This appeal has been\r\nquoted by a modern writer as a proof of the duplicity of Hus; and the\r\nsame antagonist has scornfully contrasted this anxious hesitation with\r\nthe exulting approval of the change which Hus proclaimed at a later\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nTo those who try to weigh both sides of a question, it may not seem\r\nso difficult to understand that Hus may have heartily desired, and\r\nexulted in, the victory of the reforming party and the freedom of the\r\nBohemians from German domination, and yet may have hesitated in his\r\nown mind, especially in sickness, about the justice of the particular\r\nstep which brought things to a crisis. The point which rather seems to\r\ndistinguish him from other men in the matter was the candour with which\r\nhe confessed those previous doubts at a place and in a time when such a\r\nconfession was certain to be used against him.\r\n\r\nBut if the charge of duplicity against Hus is founded mainly on\r\nignorance of human nature, the accusation of violence which was\r\nbrought against the Bohemian reformers may have been partially due to\r\na confusion between two contests which were taking place at the same\r\ntime, and in which the same parties were to some extent involved.\r\nFor, while the Germans and Bohemians were struggling for supremacy\r\nin the University of Prague, Wenceslaus was devoting his energies to\r\nthe punishment of the Archbishop and clergy for their championship of\r\nGregory XII. In this, as in every other case, Wenceslaus soon damaged\r\nhis cause by his utter want of self-restraint. Mobs were let loose\r\nupon the clergy, many acts of violence were committed, and a general\r\nsense of insecurity prevailed. Zbynĕk, who had plenty of that bull-dog\r\ncourage which one might expect from an ex-soldier, replied to the\r\nking’s violence by putting Prague under an interdict. How the king\r\nmight have met this defiance one may guess from his previous conduct;\r\nbut the Archbishop and his clergy were saved from the fate of Nepomuc\r\nby a sudden change of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Pisa had agreed to depose the two existing claimants\r\nof the Papacy; and, after some discussion, they chose a new Pope,\r\nunder the name of Alexander V. At first, of course, this Pope was not\r\nvery favourably inclined to an Archbishop who had steadily opposed\r\nhis election; but, when Zbynĕk accepted his authority, and showed\r\nhis appreciation of him by sending him rich gifts, Alexander became\r\nalarmed at the spread of heresy in Bohemia, and granted a commission\r\nfor inquiry into the writings of Wyclif, and a permission to Zbynĕk to\r\nremove those writings from the eyes of the faithful.\r\n\r\nThis commission gave a new opportunity to the enemies of Hus; and\r\nthey presented a petition against him to the Archbishop, in which\r\nthey charged him with sixteen acts of heresy and disorder. Some of\r\nthese charges had already been put forward on former occasions, others\r\nalleged against him heresies which he repudiated; but there are four\r\naccusations at least that are specially worth noting, both for their\r\nown character, and on account of the answers made to them by Hus. The\r\nfourth charge was that in a conversation, which took place at the time\r\nof the drowning of John Nepomuc and the arrest of the Dean of Prague,\r\nHus had spoken lightly of these acts, and had condemned the proposal to\r\nput Prague under an Interdict on account of them. Hus replied to this\r\ncharge by quoting his actual words. “If,” said he, “he himself, or any\r\nother, had been killed or imprisoned, that was no reason why men should\r\ncease to give praise to God throughout the kingdom of Bohemia.” The\r\nfifth clause he answered by one of those distinctions which seemed to\r\nhis enemies so dishonest. Hus was accused of saying that anti-Christ\r\nhad fixed a foot in the Roman Church, which it was difficult to move.\r\nTo this charge Hus answered that he had never said this of the Roman\r\n_Church_, because he considered that that Church consisted of all those\r\nwho held the faith preached by St. Peter and St. Paul at Rome; but\r\nthat he did maintain that anti-Christ had set his foot very firmly in\r\nthe Roman _Court_ (Curia). Thirdly, he objected to two of the charges\r\nagainst him on the ground that they implied his use of words which had\r\nno equivalent in the Bohemian language, and which, therefore, he could\r\nnot have used in the Bethlehem Chapel. Lastly, in answer to the charge\r\nof having stirred up ill-will between Bohemian and German, he denied\r\nthat he had done this, unless either German or Bohemian had taken\r\nunjust occasion from his words; and he reiterated his statement that he\r\nloved a good German better than a bad Bohemian.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that these articles were intended to identify still\r\nmore closely the struggle of the Archbishop and clergy against secular\r\nintrusion and heretical doctrine with the struggles of the Germans for\r\nsupremacy in Bohemia. But if, by so doing, Zbynĕk secured a stronger\r\nfollowing in the outside world, and bound to his cause those Germans\r\nwho had remained in Bohemia, he irritated against him still more\r\nstrongly the feeling of the Bohemian nobles and of a large number of\r\nthe citizens of Prague; and he even alienated from him many of the\r\ninferior clergy.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful influence, which was specially exerted at this time\r\nin favour of Hus, was that of the Queen Sophia. She had been greatly\r\nimpressed by the preacher, and had taken him as her chief adviser, some\r\nsay her confessor; and, though it may be true of Wenceslaus that he\r\nhated Zbynĕk more than he loved Hus, the reverse is true of his wife.\r\nYet in spite of all this force of opposition, Zbynĕk showed very little\r\nsign of yielding. He consented, indeed, to postpone any final act until\r\nthe Margrave of Moravia could be consulted. But, whether Jodok delayed\r\nbeyond the time proposed, or whether the Archbishop simply grew tired\r\nof waiting, he resolved, on June 10, 1410, publicly to burn two hundred\r\nof Wyclif’s books; and accordingly they were burnt in great state, in\r\nthe court of the archiepiscopal palace, the bells of the churches\r\nbeing tolled during the performance.\r\n\r\nAs if to mark the man against whom this proceeding was specially\r\naimed, the Archbishop followed it up by commanding the closing of all\r\nprivate chapels, a command understood by everybody to be intended\r\nespecially against the chapel in which Hus preached. Hus and his\r\nfriends indignantly appealed to the Pope against these proceedings; and\r\nthey did not fail to point out that many of the works which were burnt\r\nwere not theological at all, but simply dealt with abstract philosophy.\r\nIndeed, the traditions of learning and culture, which the German\r\nscholars had hoped to secure to their side, in their first struggle\r\nagainst the Bohemian language, were now appealed to by the opposite\r\nparty with much more force. Zbynĕk was ridiculed in satirical songs\r\nfor having burnt books which he had never read; and the University of\r\nBologna, when consulted by the Pope, denounced the burning of the books\r\nas an insult to the University of Oxford. Zbynĕk, indeed, would have\r\nfought to the last; but Pope Alexander was shaken by the opposition\r\nwhich these proceedings had called forth, and he checked the inquiry\r\ninto Wyclif’s books, and continued to delay matters, till the decision\r\nwas taken out of his hands by death.\r\n\r\nBoth parties made haste to approach the new Pope, John XXIII.; and he\r\ndemanded that Hus should come to Rome. The danger of the way made a\r\ngood excuse for refusal; and John, having received rich presents from\r\nZbynĕk, consented to excommunicate Hus for contumacy. This, however,\r\ndid not affect Wenceslaus’s attitude; for, irritated by Zbynĕk’s\r\nopposition, and impressed by the queen’s partiality for Hus, the king\r\nhad become a zealous champion of the Reformers. He demanded that Zbynĕk\r\nshould compensate those whose books he had burnt; and, on his refusal,\r\nhe confiscated his property for the benefit of the owners of the books.\r\nAt the same time the king and his friends wrote to the Pope to assure\r\nhim that he had been ill-informed about the circumstances of the case.\r\nThe Pope being thus politely set on one side, and riot and disorder\r\ncontinuing, there seemed an opportunity for some outsider to step in.\r\n\r\nThis opportunity was eagerly seized by Sigismund. He had never formally\r\nresigned that administrative power which Wenceslaus had granted to\r\nhim in his time of emergency; and, though he had nominally supported\r\nWenceslaus against Rupert in his claim to the Imperial crown, he was\r\nnow intriguing to succeed the latter and to set aside his brother.\r\nWenceslaus, on his part, was willing enough to listen to proposals\r\nfor peace when they did not come from a clerical source; and Zbynĕk\r\nconsented to accept the arbitration proposed. But, when the arbitrators\r\ndemanded that the archbishop should write to the Pope to ask him to\r\nrepeal the excommunication of Hus, Zbynĕk refused to submit to this\r\ndecision; and he went to Presburg to appeal personally to Sigismund.\r\nThere, however, he fell ill and died; and, in a few months, the\r\ncontroversy had assumed quite another form.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the Council of Pisa had professed to put an\r\nend to the disunion in the Church by deposing the two claimants of the\r\nPapacy, and electing Alexander V. in their place. But, though Alexander\r\nV., and his successor, John XXIII., had probably been accepted by a\r\nmajority of the authorities of the Church, the deposed Popes still, at\r\ntimes, put forward claims which could easily be taken advantage of by\r\nthose who wished to stir up division in the Church. Ladislaus, the king\r\nof Naples, who had a grudge against John, took up the cause of Gregory\r\nXII. Therefore, in December, 1411, John proclaimed a crusade against\r\nthe King of Naples, and promised plenary indulgence to all who would\r\nsupport this expedition, either in purse or person.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners for promoting this war arrived in Prague in 1412;\r\nand they soon set to work, not merely to preach the crusade, but to\r\norganise a regular system for the sale of the indulgences. Some attempt\r\nto start this trade had been begun in 1393, but it does not seem to\r\nhave been then carried on on so extensive a scale. _Now_ the Legate\r\nfarmed out the right of selling these indulgences to other priests,\r\ngranting them preferment in the Church, and receiving from them a\r\ncommission on what they raised. As respectable clergymen would not\r\noften undertake such an office, the trade fell into the hands of men of\r\ndisreputable lives, who were thus brought prominently to the front. Hus\r\nhad objected, from the first, to the attempt to involve the Bohemians\r\nin a war which he considered unchristian; and, when to the proposal for\r\nthe crusade was added the organisation of the sale of indulgences, he\r\ndetermined to raise the question in an assembly of the University.\r\n\r\nBut he now found that some, who had been hitherto his followers, were\r\nprepared to resist and oppose him. Stanislaus of Znojem and Stephen\r\nPálec̆ had been released from their imprisonment at Bologna, at the\r\nrequest of Wenceslaus; and since their return to Prague they had\r\ngradually drifted into the ranks of the opponents of reform. Stanislaus\r\nhad been the first to show this change. The charge of heresy on which\r\nhe had been arrested had been based on a pamphlet dealing with Wyclif’s\r\ndoctrines. He pleaded that the apparent Wyclifite tendency of the\r\npamphlet was due to its incompleteness; and, when ordered to finish it,\r\nhe did so in a sense hostile to the doctrines of Wyclif.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, though Hus had repudiated many of the\r\ndoctrines of the English Reformer, he had yet opposed the general\r\ncondemnation of his works, and had spoken warmly of his character.\r\nTherefore Stanislaus’ attack upon Wyclif paved the way for an open\r\nopposition to Hus. Pálec̆, indeed, had remained on the side of his old\r\nleader during the struggle with Zbynĕk, but the opposition to the Papal\r\nBull drove him also into the orthodox ranks. The cry of cowardice has\r\nbeen raised against him by the friends of Hus, and seems, indeed, to\r\nhave been sanctioned by Hus himself. But, unscrupulous and malignant as\r\nPálec̆ afterwards showed himself, it may be doubted whether the charge\r\nof cowardice was, in this instance, a just one. It must be remembered\r\nthat in his previous opposition to Popes, Hus had protected himself by\r\nthe well-recognised formula that the Pope had been misinformed on the\r\ncondition of affairs in Bohemia. On this occasion the question at issue\r\nwas not so much one of information about special facts as of clear\r\nmoral principles; and the issue of the Bull took away all possibility\r\nof throwing the blame of the Pope’s action on misleading advisers.\r\nMoreover, the opposition of Hus was no longer covered by the authority\r\nof the King. Wenceslaus, having once committed himself to opposition\r\nto Gregory, was not disposed to inquire too curiously into the\r\nmethods which were used to suppress the fallen Pope. He had therefore\r\nsanctioned John’s Bull, and thereby approved the crusade. It may well,\r\ntherefore, have been that Pálec̆, though willing to resist the ordinary\r\ncurrent of clerical opinion, might yet doubt the lawfulness and\r\npropriety of setting himself against his spiritual and temporal rulers.\r\nAt any rate, when Hus brought before the Masters of the University his\r\nproposal to denounce the crusade and its methods, Pálec̆ and Stanislaus\r\nheaded the opposition to their former leader, and won the majority of\r\nthe Masters to their side.\r\n\r\nBut Hus was not to be silenced. He continued to preach and write\r\nagainst the sale of indulgences; and he proposed to hold a discussion\r\non the Papal Bull in the Carolinum, a college founded for the clergy\r\nby Charles IV. He was now compelled into a position which seems to\r\nanticipate the more advanced Reformers of the following century; for\r\nwhen the new Archbishop, Albik, called on him to obey the Apostolic\r\ncommands, he answered that the Apostolic commands were those contained\r\nin the teaching of Christ and His Apostles; that, so far as the Pope’s\r\ncommands agreed with them, he would obey them gladly; but that, if\r\nthey did not agree with them, he would not obey them, if the fire were\r\nkindled in his presence.\r\n\r\nHus was now at issue with old friends, with the leaders of learning,\r\nand with the rulers of Church and State. It was therefore with\r\nspecial satisfaction that he must have hailed a new supporter who\r\ncame to his aid at this crisis. This was a young Bohemian nobleman,\r\nnamed Hieronymus, or Jerom. He has often been credited with the\r\nfirst introduction of Wyclif’s works into Bohemia, though some\r\nhistorians have thrown doubt on this claim. Whether it were so or\r\nnot, he certainly now formed a link between the reforming leaders\r\nand the fashionable world, which did not previously exist. His easy\r\ncircumstances and noble birth gave him entrance to the Court circles of\r\nEurope; and his attractive manners, splendid dress, and love of display\r\ngained him fame and popularity. Moreover, he had found great delight\r\nin exciting discussions on doubtful points of theology in the various\r\nUniversities which he had visited. He began these discussions at\r\nHeidelberg, apparently against the wish of the University authorities.\r\nHe had visited Oxford, whither a reputation for heresy had preceded\r\nhim; and he had specially provoked the opposition of Gerson, the\r\nChancellor of the Paris University, by the controversies which he had\r\ninaugurated in that famous centre of learning. He now plunged boldly\r\ninto the dispute about the sale of indulgences. His brilliant and\r\npolished oratory threw into shade for the time the simpler eloquence\r\nof Hus. He was followed home, on one occasion, by a large crowd of\r\nstudents; and the reforming movement began to attract the sympathies of\r\nthe younger nobles.\r\n\r\nBut it soon became evident that the new converts would bring more zeal\r\nthan dignity to the camp of the reformers. The forms of ridicule of the\r\nclerical party indulged in by these fiery spirits can scarcely have\r\nbeen welcome to the soberer reformers who had been first drawn to the\r\nteaching of Hus. Thus, for instance, a procession was organised, which\r\nmarched through the streets of Prague, and in which the chief figure\r\nwas a student, who was dressed as a woman of ill-fame, wearing round\r\nher neck an imitation of the Papal Bulls. Such demonstrations as these,\r\nwhen accompanied by satirical songs, naturally led to disorder and\r\nriot. Wenceslaus, who was divided in feeling between his friendliness\r\nto Hus and his desire to enforce his own decrees, tried in vain to\r\neffect a compromise between the contending parties, and, finding\r\nreconciliation or even partial restraint impossible, he forbad the\r\nreformers to offer any further opposition to the sale of indulgences.\r\n\r\nThis decree at once called out the sterner and nobler side of the\r\nreforming spirit. In spite of the king’s prohibition, three young\r\nmen came to the church where the champions of the indulgences were\r\npreaching, and made a public protest against the preacher’s words. The\r\nintruders were promptly secured by the officials of the town council,\r\nand were at once taken to the Great Ring. A large crowd gathered to\r\nsee what was intended, and Hus came forward to remind the councillors\r\nthat he was the first promoter of the opposition to the indulgences,\r\nand that they ought therefore to punish him before they punished\r\nthese young men. The Councillors gave an answer which seemed to imply\r\nthat the prisoners should not be injured; but no sooner had the crowd\r\ndispersed than the youths were taken into a side street and summarily\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement followed this treachery; and numbers of people paraded\r\nthe streets declaring their readiness to die for the truth. Hus, from\r\nhis pulpit, praised the young men who had been executed, and exhorted\r\nhis hearers to stand by the truth.\r\n\r\nAnother opponent now came forward to give new impulse to the attacks\r\non Hus. This was a German priest of questionable antecedents, called\r\nMichael de Causis. He drew up a list of articles against the reformer,\r\nwhich revived, more definitely, the charge of sympathising with\r\nWyclif’s doctrine, both as to the Sacraments, and the interference\r\nof secular authorities with the property of the clergy. With these\r\ncharges Michael now combined the accusation of stirring up the people\r\nagainst the bishops, and making ill-feeling in the University. Pope\r\nJohn, already indignant at the opposition to his Bull, was roused by\r\nthese charges to more decided action. He excommunicated Hus, and laid\r\nan Interdict on Prague. Several Germans tried to give practical force\r\nto this sentence by rushing armed into the Bethlehem chapel, and\r\nattempting to kill Hus; but his friends rallied round him, and the\r\nassassins were forced to retire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT RING OF PRAGUE. SCENE OF MURDER OF THE\r\nOPPONENTS OF THE INDULGENCE.]\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Wenceslaus seems to have shown towards Hus a\r\nforbearance such as he hardly ever exhibited towards others who crossed\r\nhis path. Doubtless one must trace in this conduct the influence of\r\nthe queen; but, to whatever cause it was due, it did not fail to\r\naffect the feelings of Hus. He was shocked at the amount of disorder\r\nand bitterness prevailing in Prague; and he was grieved to think that\r\nhe was, to some extent, the cause of it. The desire for peace and\r\nconcession which these considerations produced was naturally quickened\r\nby personal gratitude to the King; and he now consented to leave\r\nPrague for a time, and to retire to Austi, where he remained under the\r\nprotection of a powerful noble.\r\n\r\nIt was during this retirement that he composed the book “De Ecclesia,”\r\nwhich was to cost him so dear. In this he declared, more distinctly\r\nthan before, his disbelief in the necessity of the Pope and Cardinals\r\nas a part of the constitution of the Church, and his belief in the\r\nessential equality of all Orders of the clergy. But his retirement\r\nfrom Prague brought no cessation to the fierceness of the controversy.\r\nJakaubek of Kladrau, who now took the lead among the friends of Hus,\r\ndemanded a reformation of the lives of the clergy, and declared that\r\nno peace could be made till these were amended. Wenceslaus once more\r\nstepped in as peacemaker. He appointed a commission of four, to which\r\nthe representatives of the opposite parties were to present their\r\ndifferent statements for consideration and arbitration. Stanislaus and\r\nhis friends drew up an address, in which they spoke of the Church,\r\n“whose head is the Pope, and whose body is the Cardinals.” For this\r\nJakaubek and his friends proposed to substitute the words, “whose head\r\nis Jesus Christ our Saviour, and His representative is the Pope.” When,\r\nhowever, the opposite parties came before the arbitrators, Stanislaus,\r\nPálec̆, and their friends refused to submit to the order of discussion\r\nsuggested by the commissioners; whereupon Wenceslaus cut short the\r\nproceedings by banishing from Bohemia Stanislaus, Pálec̆, and two of\r\ntheir friends, as disturbers of the peace.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Hus had been vexed with scruples of conscience, as\r\nto whether he had violated his duty in consenting to leave Prague,\r\nand to abandon his pulpit at the order of the King; and, after vainly\r\nendeavouring to satisfy himself by a comparison of quotations from St.\r\nAugustine and others, he at last came back to Prague, though he could\r\nnot at once make up his mind so far to defy the king as to return to\r\nhis pulpit in the Bethlehem Chapel. While he was in this hesitating\r\nstate, the crisis arrived which was to solve his difficulties for him,\r\nand give him the longed-for opportunity of vindicating his teaching\r\nbefore the world, without directly defying the King of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1414, Sigismund once more arrived in Prague. He had\r\ncontrived, on the death of Count Rupert, to get himself elected Holy\r\nRoman Emperor, but had afterwards reconciled Wenceslaus to this\r\narrangement, by promising to recognise the latter as Emperor, during\r\nhis life, if Wenceslaus would allow him to retain the name of King of\r\nthe Romans, which implied heirship to the Empire. This promise seems\r\nto have been very ill-kept; but probably Wenceslaus was too busy with\r\nhis Bohemian troubles to care to enforce a claim which had formerly\r\nproved so irksome to him. At the period at which we have arrived, he\r\nwas contented to leave both the dignity and power to his brother.\r\n\r\nCircumstances now afforded a splendid opening for the display of both.\r\nThe quarrel between John and Ladislaus, after being patched up by a\r\ntemporary peace, had broken out again so fiercely that John had been\r\nforced to fly from Rome, and to take refuge in Bologna. From thence he\r\nappealed to Sigismund to call a new Council for the settlement of the\r\ntroubles of the Church, and the final suppression of the schism in the\r\npapacy; and he consented that it should be held in the free, Imperial\r\ntown of Constance. Hus also saw his opportunity in this Council, and\r\nhe appealed to Sigismund to secure him a public hearing before it.\r\nSigismund readily consented, and promised also to give a safe-conduct\r\nfor the purpose. Before starting, however, Hus secured from the new\r\nArchbishop, Conrad, and from the chief Inquisitor in Bohemia, letters\r\ndeclaring their belief in his orthodoxy. He then put himself under the\r\nspecial care of John of Chlum and Wenceslaus of Duba, and, under their\r\nescort, he started from Prague, without waiting for the arrival of the\r\nsafe-conduct. To judge by some expressions in his letter to Sigismund,\r\nand still more by a letter which he left at Prague, to be opened by\r\na friend in case of his death, Hus had already a gloomy anticipation\r\nof the fate which awaited him. But his spirits rose as the journey\r\ncontinued; for everywhere he met with kindness and hospitality, even\r\nfrom the Germans, and at Nürnberg he was chosen to preach before the\r\nnobles and clergy. So, with raised hopes, on the 3rd of November, 1414,\r\nhe arrived at the town of Constance.\r\n\r\nHe and his friends were somewhat startled to find that the inn at which\r\nhe lodged was close to that already occupied by the Pope, who had so\r\nrecently excommunicated him. John of Chlum and Henry of Lac̆embok\r\ndecided that the best course would be to go at once to the Pope, and\r\ntell him that Hus had arrived, under the promise of safe-conduct from\r\nthe Emperor. The Pope answered that he had no desire to hinder Hus in\r\nany way; that he had no wish to do him any violence; and that Hus might\r\nremain safe in Constance, even if he had killed the Pope’s own brother.\r\nThe arrival, two days later, of a messenger from Sigismund bearing the\r\nsafe-conduct must have further confirmed Hus’s sense of security; and,\r\nso safe did his friends suppose him, that a rumour even spread among\r\nsome of them that he was to preach before the Council.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, there had arrived in Constance two enemies far\r\nmore deadly to Hus than Pope or King. These were Michael de Causis,\r\nthe German priest, and Stephen Pálec̆, his former friend and recent\r\nopponent, who had so lately been banished from Prague as a disturber\r\nof the peace. They agreed to draw up extracts, chiefly compiled from\r\nHus’s book “De Ecclesia,” some of them tolerably accurate, others\r\nperverting his meaning. These Pálec̆ carried about among the Cardinals,\r\nbishops, and friars, and he stirred them up to take action against\r\nHus. At last, on the 28th of November, while Hus was at dinner, there\r\narrived at his house two bishops, the burgomaster of Constance, and\r\na German gentleman. Not knowing Hus by sight, they first applied to\r\nJohn of Chlum for an opportunity of speaking with Hus, on behalf of\r\nthe Cardinals. Chlum seems at once to have suspected treachery, and\r\nhe told them that Hus had come to Constance to speak publicly before\r\nthe Emperor and Council, and that he was under the protection of the\r\nEmperor’s safe-conduct. The bishops answered that they had come in\r\nthe interests of peace and to prevent disorder. Then Hus, rising from\r\ntable, came to them, and said that, though he had come to speak to the\r\nwhole Council and not to the Cardinals only, yet, if the Cardinals\r\ndesired it, he would come to see them.\r\n\r\nWhen he was brought to the palace, the Cardinals told him that they had\r\nbeen informed that he taught many errors. He answered that he would\r\nsooner die than teach errors, and he would amend any if they were shown\r\nto him. Then the Cardinals went away for a time, leaving him under the\r\nguard of soldiers. Still, they seem to have hesitated, and, in order\r\nto obtain clearer proof, they sent a monk to try to entrap him into\r\nconfession of heresy. But, when this failed, Stephen Pálec̆ and Michael\r\nde Causis urged them to arrest him. One point, which they strongly\r\npressed in proof of his heresy, was the practice which Jakaubek of\r\nKladrau had introduced since the departure of Hus, of administration\r\nof the Communion in both kinds to the laity. Then they raised against\r\nhim the charge which he had so often denied, of a sympathy with\r\nWyclif’s opposition to the doctrine of Transubstantiation. They revived\r\nthe old grievances of the Germans in the matter of the University\r\nvotes, and then charged him with having incited to the plunder of the\r\nclergy, and of having stood alone in the support of the doctrines of\r\nWyclif against both Germans and Bohemians. The Cardinals then sent a\r\nmessenger to Chlum, who had accompanied Hus to the palace, and told him\r\nthat he might leave Hus and return home. Chlum hastened to the Pope,\r\nreminded him of his former promise, and insisted again on Sigismund’s\r\nsafe-conduct. Pope John answered that he had not ordered the arrest of\r\nHus, but that he could not resist the Cardinals.\r\n\r\nHus, in the meantime, had been hurried off to a Dominican convent,\r\nin a suburb of Constance, and was there thrown into a damp prison.\r\nChlum was not, however, to be silenced; and he put up bills on the\r\ngreat church at Constance, denouncing the Pope and Cardinals for their\r\nbreach of faith. Then he appealed to the Bohemian nobles who had come\r\nto the Council; and they and the leading Polish nobles also prepared\r\na protest against the treatment of Hus, to be presented to Sigismund\r\non his arrival. In the meantime, the treatment of Hus showed a mixture\r\nof cruelty and cunning on the part of his opponents. While, on the one\r\nhand, the prison in which he was confined was so damp as to produce\r\nfever, he was yet allowed to communicate freely with his friends; and\r\ntwo of the letters which he wrote from prison had some influence on his\r\nfate. In one of these he defended the practice, which Jakaubek was now\r\nintroducing, of Communion in both kinds. In the other he declared that,\r\neven if he were condemned by false witnesses, his friends were not to\r\nbelieve that he had forsaken the truth. This latter letter seems to\r\nhave fallen into the hands of Pálec̆, or some other enemy; and it was\r\nat once perverted into the statement that, if he revoked and recanted\r\nanything at Constance, he would still continue to hold and teach it\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nWhile these intrigues of the enemies of Hus were being reduced into a\r\nliterary form, Sigismund at last arrived at Constance. Most English\r\nreaders will remember the scene, as Carlyle has given it, of his\r\nsplendid appearance on his entrance into the Council, of his pompous\r\naddress about the need of suppressing the schism in the Church, and\r\nof his rebuke to the man who ventured to correct his Latin--“Rex sum\r\nRomanus et super grammaticam.”\r\n\r\nThe question of Hus’s imprisonment was brought before him by the\r\nBohemian and Polish nobles; and he at first protested, with much\r\nindignation, against the violation of his safe-conduct. But the\r\nnecessity of dealing with the question of the Papacy compelled him,\r\nfor a time, to abandon further inquiry into the Bohemian heresies; for\r\nthe representatives of the Popes arrived soon after at the Council.\r\nAt first the discussion was confined to the consideration of the\r\ndisorders produced by the multiplication of claimants to the Papal\r\nthrone; and a demand was made for the simultaneous resignation of\r\nall the rivals, in order that the ground might be cleared for a new\r\nelection. But it soon became evident that the case against John XXIII.\r\nwas based on very different grounds from the opposition to his rivals;\r\nand fearing the consequences which might ensue, he fled from Constance.\r\nThe Duke of Austria, willing enough to hamper a Council presided over\r\nby a member of the House of Luxemburg, lent his aid to this scheme, and\r\nJohn escaped to Freyburg. He was, however, seized and brought back; and\r\nhe was soon after degraded from the Papacy, on account of his horrible\r\ncrimes.\r\n\r\nHis attempted escape gave a new opportunity to the enemies of Hus. If,\r\nthey said, one prisoner of the Council could escape, why not another?\r\nHus was too lightly guarded at the convent; and he must be put under\r\nsafer charge. Therefore, on the night of March 24th, a guard of a\r\nhundred and seventy armed men carried him off to a fortress, outside\r\nthe city, belonging to the Bishop of Constance; and there he was\r\nchained night and day. Again his friends indignantly protested; but\r\nSigismund was now evidently falling under hostile influences. He had\r\nbeen offended already with Hus for having come to the Council without\r\nwaiting for the safe-conduct; and he was persuaded that the fact that\r\nHus possessed that safe-conduct had been in some way suppressed.\r\nIndignant at this rumour, Sigismund, on the 8th of April, by the advice\r\nof the Council, revoked all the letters of safe-conduct which he had\r\ngranted. At last, on April 17th, commissioners were appointed to\r\nreport on Hus’s case.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been about this time that Jerom also arrived at\r\nthe Council. His career, since the struggle against the indulgences\r\nhad been very unsatisfactory. He had first gone to Presburg to preach\r\nbefore Sigismund, and had there been imprisoned. Escaping from prison,\r\nhe had made his way to Vienna; but had again been arrested there, and\r\nhad consented to submit to an examination by an Austrian bishop. Set\r\nfree on parole, he had broken his word and fled back to Bohemia, from\r\nwhence he addressed a taunting letter to the bishop. It was, therefore,\r\nunder the shadow of some discredit that he came to Constance, and\r\noffered to answer any charges of heresy which might be brought against\r\nhim. At the same time he demanded a safe-conduct from Sigismund; and,\r\nnot being able to obtain it, he fled from Constance, to which he was\r\nforcibly brought back by the officers of the Duke of Bavaria. He was\r\nthen imprisoned, and kept heavily ironed for nearly a year.\r\n\r\nHus accused him of having disregarded the advice of his friends;\r\nand though it is not clear, whether this refers to his coming to\r\nthe Council, or to his conduct when there, it is certain that his\r\nappearance must have made Hus’s position more difficult.\r\n\r\nAt last, on May 14, 1415, the nobles of Bohemia and Poland were able\r\nto make their protest before the Council against the treatment of Hus.\r\nThey also indignantly complained of the insults and slanders which\r\nwere being circulated against the Bohemian nation, as if they were\r\nprofaners of the Sacrament, and guilty of all sorts of indecencies in\r\nits celebration. The Bishop of Litomys̆l rose in answer to this to say\r\nthat he was the author of these reports; and that this desecration of\r\nthe Sacrament was the natural consequence of granting the cup to the\r\nlaity. Another bishop answered their reference to Hus’s safe-conduct\r\nby saying that Hus only obtained it after his imprisonment. To this\r\nthe Bohemian lords retorted that John of Chlum had himself shown the\r\nsafe-conduct to the Pope before the arrest of Hus. They defended his\r\nnon-appearance at Rome in answer to the summons of the Pope; and they\r\nproduced the testimony of the University of Prague to his orthodoxy.\r\nThen, after reiterating their denial of the charges made by the\r\nBishop of Litomys̆l, they wound up with a rather amusing outburst of\r\naristocratic feeling. The Bishop of Litomys̆l had demanded their names,\r\nthat he might know to whom he had to give answer. They had fancied that\r\ntheir names were tolerably well known to him; but, for their part, they\r\nwere perfectly willing to give not only their own names, but those of\r\ntheir ancestors. On a later occasion they produced the certificate\r\nwhich the Bohemian Inquisitor had given to Hus.\r\n\r\nAt last, after repeated appeals, Hus was granted an audience on June\r\n5th. But no sooner did he try to answer the various charges brought\r\nagainst him, then all the Council howled at him, and, after demanding\r\nthat he should give a simple answer (Yes! or No!), were proceeding to\r\ncondemn him on the evidence of the falsified letter to his friends.\r\nFortunately Oldr̆ich and Peter Mladenovich, who had accompanied Hus\r\nto Constance, heard the noise of the riot, and hastened to inform\r\nJohn of Chlum and Wenceslaus of Duba. They went at once to Sigismund,\r\nwho was not present at the Council; and he sent the Count Palatine\r\nand Frederick of Hohenzollern to order the Councillors to hear Hus\r\npatiently. After some further disorder, the audience was adjourned to\r\nthe 7th of June.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting many new points were raised against Hus, both of\r\ndoctrine and conduct. He defended his resistance to the condemnation\r\nof Wyclif’s books, on the ground that he had been called on to say\r\nthat every proposition of Wyclif’s was either heretical, scandalous,\r\nor erroneous. At the same time he admitted that he had wished his soul\r\nto be with Wyclif, on account of Wyclif’s pure life. When charged with\r\nhaving appealed to Christ when condemned by the Pope, he declared\r\nthat to be a most just and efficacious appeal, a statement which was\r\nreceived with laughter by his judges. At the same time he indignantly\r\ndenied having encouraged his followers to smite with the material\r\nsword. Lastly, while maintaining the justice of the decision about the\r\nBohemian votes, he denied the extraordinary charge of Pálec̆ that he\r\nhad driven out the Germans.\r\n\r\nBut he was, unfortunately, doomed to irritate against him on every\r\noccasion the intense vanity of Sigismund. One great object of his\r\nenemies was to deprive him of any benefit accruing to him from his\r\nsafe-conduct; and they caught eagerly at an expression of his that\r\nhe had come, freely and voluntarily, to the Council. Provoked at the\r\nconstant distortions of his language, he broke out with a boast, which,\r\nhowever true, was most ill-judged. If, he said, he had not wished to\r\ncome to the Council, neither King nor Emperor could have compelled\r\nhim; for there were many friends who would have hidden him in their\r\nhouses, so that neither Wenceslaus nor Sigismund could have found him.\r\nWhen a murmur arose at this, John of Chlum stepped forward and said\r\nthat, though he was but a poor gentlemen in his own country, he, for\r\none, would have guarded Hus for a year, whoever liked or disliked it;\r\nand that there were many others who would have protected him in strong\r\ncastles. This belittling of his power roused Sigismund’s anger. He\r\nexclaimed that he had sent Hus his safe-conduct before he left Prague;\r\nand that he had provided the noblemen for his escort; and he now\r\nadvised Hus to submit himself completely to the Council. Hus at once\r\nanswered, in his more ordinary tone, that he thanked Sigismund for the\r\nsafe-conduct; and, for his part, he would be glad to be corrected by\r\nthe Council if he were shown to be wrong.\r\n\r\nOn June 8th, he was examined more in detail on thirty-nine Articles\r\ngathered from his writings. Some of these dealt with the subtle\r\nquestions of Predestination; but others were concerned with his\r\nassertions in the “De Ecclesia” that a visible head was not necessary\r\nto the Church; and that a Pope in mortal sin ceases to be a true Pope.\r\nHus was able, with great force, to appeal to the action of the Council\r\nitself in justification of these doctrines. If a Pope in mortal sin\r\ndid not cease to be a true Pope, by what right had they deposed John\r\nXXIII.? If the visible Head was necessary to the Church, who was the\r\nHead _then_, when all the Popes had either resigned or been deposed?\r\nSuch arguments were probably too forcible to be convincing.\r\n\r\nBut again, by some strange fatality, Hus was further to irritate\r\nagainst him the suspicion and anger of the Holy Roman Emperor. “Not\r\nonly,” said Hus, “did a Pope cease to be a true Pope if in mortal\r\nsin, but the case of the deposition of Saul by Samuel showed that a\r\nKing might be treated in a similar way.” Sigismund was sitting at a\r\nwindow in a back part of the room when this utterance was made; but the\r\nCardinals eagerly called him forward and made Hus repeat his statement.\r\nNor was this the only offence which he was doomed to commit against\r\nthe Emperor on that fatal day. When the examination had concluded,\r\nthe chief Cardinal asked Hus whether he would submit entirely to the\r\nCouncil, or if he wished to defend any of the Articles alleged against\r\nhim. But when Hus demanded an opportunity for further discussion, the\r\nCardinal answered that the Council insisted on his abjuration and\r\nrevocation of the Articles alleged against him, and his promise not to\r\npreach them any more. To this Hus answered, that he could not revoke\r\nand abjure opinions which he had never held, mentioning as an instance\r\nthe denial of Transubstantiation. As for the opinions which he had set\r\nforth, he would retract them when they had been refuted. Sigismund\r\nendeavoured to convince him that he could abjure Articles which he had\r\nnever held; whereupon Hus ventured to dispute the Emperor’s use of the\r\nword “abjurare.” This further denial of the power of the Roman Emperor\r\nover the Latin language roused to a still higher pitch the irritation\r\nof Sigismund “Super Grammaticam;” and he told Hus that, unless he would\r\nabjure and revoke all the errors alleged against him, the Council must\r\ndeal with him according to its laws.\r\n\r\nUpon this a fat and richly dressed priest, who was sitting in the\r\nwindow, cried out that they should not allow him to recant, since he\r\nwould not keep his word; and again he quoted the falsified version of\r\nHus’s letter. Then Pálec̆ and Michael de Causis pressed upon him a\r\nnumber of charges, some new and some old, mixing up actual writings\r\nand doings of Hus with doctrines which he had repudiated; and, after\r\nthis had continued for some time, the Council decided to send him back\r\nto prison, to see if a period of delay would induce him to revoke his\r\nheresies.\r\n\r\nFor the moment Hus seemed to be crushed by the noise and bitterness of\r\nhis enemies. He was leaving the Council with the sense that the world\r\nwas entirely against him, when, as he drew near to the door, John of\r\nChlum pressed through the crowd and shook him warmly by the hand. The\r\nmemory of that handshake seems to have lingered to the last in the mind\r\nof Hus. Other friends, too, were still faithful to him; and, after he\r\nhad left the Council, several of them pressed to the window of the\r\nconvent where the Council was being held, to hear what should follow.\r\n\r\nSigismund was now thoroughly inflamed against Hus. He had belittled\r\nthe protection which Sigismund had offered him, and had declared that\r\nhis friends could protect him against the Emperor; he had quoted a\r\nScriptural instance of the deposition of kings; and, above all, he\r\nhad disputed Sigismund’s authority over the Latin language. Such a\r\nman could not be suffered to live; and the Emperor now declared that\r\nhe delivered him over to the Council to be burnt, if they so pleased;\r\nadding further, that no recantation was to be trusted. He also implied\r\nthat the death of Jerom must follow that of Hus.\r\n\r\nHus now saw that his fate was sealed; and one observes in his letters\r\nto his friends the tone of a man who is preparing for death. He was\r\nparticularly anxious, lest the more ignorant of his followers should\r\nsuffer for doctrines which they had not understood, and which they had\r\nmerely adopted from a sense of personal devotion to their teacher. So\r\nhe wrote to one of these followers, that, if he should be attacked for\r\nhis adherence to Hus, he should answer his accusers by saying, “I hope\r\nthat the Master was a good Christian, but I have not understood or read\r\nthrough the things which he taught in the schools.” The thought of the\r\ncorruptions of the clergy still weighed upon his mind; and he advised\r\nhis nephews rather to learn some manual work than to become priests;\r\nlest, if they assumed the spiritual office, they should not maintain it\r\nas it deserved.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Council, with singular maladroitness, had singled\r\nout for special condemnation the granting of the Cup to the laity;\r\nand thus, at one stroke, they changed the doctrine of a few obscure\r\nmen into the war-cry of an indignant nation. This decree called the\r\nattention to Hus to this matter, which, till then, he had not deeply\r\nconsidered; and he wrote to his successor at the Bethlehem Chapel\r\nthat he ought not to oppose the granting of the Cup to the laity,\r\nsince there was nothing but custom against it; and that, if he opposed\r\nJakaubek, there would be a division amongst the faithful.\r\n\r\nBut, while Hus was thus interesting himself in the affairs of his\r\ncountrymen, the Council were not suffering him to rest in peace. One\r\nof the few priests who had shown themselves friendly to Hus at the\r\nCouncil wrote to him urging sophistical arguments in favour of a form\r\nof recantation; and Pálec̆ paid him several visits, to worry him into\r\nconfessions of heresy. Yet, bitterly as he felt the persecutions of his\r\nformer follower, that same self-distrust and earnest desire for justice\r\nwhich he had shown in the question of the three votes, and again on his\r\nretirement from Prague, appeared, even more remarkably, in this last\r\ninterview. He entreated his enemy to pardon him for having charged him\r\nwith deliberate falsehood on the occasion of Pálec̆’s first attacks\r\nin the Council. The savage apostate was moved even to tears for the\r\nmoment, though his pity was of short duration.\r\n\r\nAt last, on July 5th, Wenceslaus of Duba and John of Chlum were sent\r\nto the prison to demand Hus’s final answer. But these messengers had\r\nbeen ill-chosen as exponents of the sophistries of Sigismund and the\r\nCardinals. John of Chlum addressed the prisoner as follows: “Master\r\nJohn, we are laymen and cannot advise you. Therefore, see if there is\r\nanything in the things which they object to you, in which you feel you\r\nare to blame. If so, do not fear to be instructed and to revoke it;\r\nbut, if you do not feel yourself guilty in your conscience in these\r\nthings, then by no means act against your conscience, nor lie in the\r\nsight of God, but rather continue till the death in the truth which\r\nyou have acknowledged.” Then Hus answered, “Lord John! know, that if\r\nI knew that I had written or preached anything contrary to the law or\r\nto our Holy Mother the Church, God is my witness that I would humbly\r\nrevoke it. But I always desired that they should show me better and\r\nmore probable Scriptures than those that I had taught; and, if they\r\nare shown me, I will most readily recant.” A bishop, who had come with\r\nthe Bohemian nobles, now introduced the sophistical platitude which is\r\ncommon on such occasions--“Do you wish,” he said, “to be wiser than the\r\nwhole Council?” “I do not wish,” answered Hus, “to be wiser than the\r\nwhole Council; but I ask you to give me the least of the Council who\r\ncan inform me by better and more efficacious Scriptures; and I am ready\r\nto revoke what I said.”\r\n\r\nOn the following day he was brought forth to receive his final\r\ncondemnation. The articles on which he was to be condemned were read\r\nout against him, though he continued to protest against the manner\r\nin which his words had been perverted. To his horror, he found that\r\nthey had added to the charges against him a new article, in which\r\nhe was accused of saying that he was a fourth person of the Deity.\r\nHe demanded the name of the author of this slander; but the Council\r\nrefused to tell him. Then, as a climax to his offences, they quoted\r\nhis appeal to Christ as against the Pope. At that he cried out “O Lord\r\nGod! do this Council condemn Thy law and Thy acts as an error? because\r\nThou, when oppressed by Thy enemies, didst commit Thy cause to Thy God\r\nand Father, and gavest us thereby an example to appeal to Thee as the\r\njustest Judge, humbly demanding Thy help.” Then for the last time he\r\nrecapitulated the circumstances under which he had come to the Council.\r\nWhen he referred to the safe-conduct, he fixed his eye upon Sigismund;\r\nand the Emperor was observed to blush. This blush is worth mentioning\r\nas the only sign of grace in that mean and treacherous career. But,\r\nof course, neither appeal nor blush could avail Hus anything; and his\r\nstatement was almost immediately followed by his condemnation to the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nThen he knelt down and said, “Lord Jesus Christ, pardon all my enemies\r\nfor Thy great mercy; Thou knowest that they have falsely accused me,\r\nthat they have produced false witnesses, and that they have produced\r\nfalse articles against me; pardon them for Thy mercy.” This prayer\r\nwas received with shouts of laughter. Then they stripped him of his\r\npriestly dress, and put on him a crown which declared him to be an\r\nHeresiarch. This was followed by a proclamation committing his soul to\r\nthe devil, to which he answered, “And I commit it to my blessed Lord\r\nJesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nHe had now quite recovered his composure; and, on his way to the\r\nstake, he smiled when he saw the place where his books were being\r\nburnt; and he smiled again when the paper crown fell off his head and\r\nhe saw the three demons which had been painted on it. When they put a\r\nheavy chain round his neck to fasten him to the stake, he exclaimed,\r\n“The Lord Jesus my Redeemer was bound with a heavier chain for me.”\r\nEven after the faggots had been piled round him, the officials came to\r\nhim, asking him to recant. He answered by repudiating the false charges\r\nthat had been made against him, and declared that he had only preached\r\nthe truth of the gospel and the holy Doctors. Then, as they lit the\r\nfire round him, he cried out, “Christ, Son of the living God, have\r\nmercy on me;” but, as he added the words, “Who wast born of the Virgin\r\nMary,” a flame struck him on the mouth, and he died praying.\r\n\r\n    N.B.--For the two stories which are most generally quoted\r\n    about Hus, I can find no sufficient authority. The beautiful\r\n    tradition of his comment on the woman who brought the faggot\r\n    to burn him, seems to belong to a much later date; while the\r\n    earliest authority, which I have discovered, for the prophecy\r\n    about the goose and the swan, is Martin Luther himself. But\r\n    both the stories are eminently characteristic; and they deserve\r\n    to live as legend, if not as authentic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nFROM THE DEATH OF HUS TO THE FIRST CORONATION OF SIGISMUND.\r\n\r\n(July 6, 1415-July 28, 1420.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFew great teachers are ever well represented by their immediate\r\nfollowers and disciples; but hardly any have been distinguished from\r\ntheir followers by so many and such important differences as those\r\nwhich separated John Hus from the men who are known by his name. First\r\nof all there was the gulf which separates the man who rejoices to die\r\nfor his faith from those who delight in killing on its behalf. But\r\nthat difference between teacher and follower, though much more vital,\r\nis, perhaps, also more common than the barrier of doctrinal difference\r\nwhich separated Hus from those who claimed to represent him. The very\r\npractice, which supplied the war-cry of the coming struggle, was\r\none which Hus had merely approved with a friendly tolerance, never\r\nadvocated with any special enthusiasm; and that difference of feeling\r\nis characteristic of the whole relations between Hus and his followers.\r\nOn the one hand the constitutional reforms of the Church, hinted at in\r\nthe “De Ecclesia,” would certainly have been rejected by the Calixtine\r\nparty; while, on the other hand, the doctrines and practices of the\r\nTaborites would have been opposed by Hus himself. It will therefore be\r\nmore convenient, in describing the following struggle, to speak of the\r\nReformers by their doctrinal name of “Utraquists,” rather than by the\r\npersonal but misleading title of “Hussite.”\r\n\r\nBut, if the spirit of the living Hus could scarcely be said to rest\r\nupon those who called themselves by his name, undoubtedly the death\r\nof Hus was recognised, on both sides, as the essential cause of the\r\nwars which followed. Men might wrangle about this or that doctrine or\r\npractice; but the murder of a Bohemian, in a place to which he had been\r\nsent under the special protection of the King and the nobles, was a\r\npoint which could never be forgiven or forgotten against Sigismund or\r\nthe Council of Constance; especially when this murder was connected\r\nwith an attempt to brand as heretics the whole Bohemian nation. This\r\nfeeling breathes through the fiery letter of the nobles of Bohemia,\r\nwhich was sent to the Council on the 2nd of September, 1415. They\r\naccused the Councillors of having condemned Hus on false evidence; and\r\nthey declared him to be a good Catholic. They give the lie to all to\r\ndare to assert that there is heresy in Bohemia or Moravia, except only\r\nto the Emperor Sigismund, who, they _hope_, is innocent in the matter;\r\nand they declare that they will defend the law of Christ and His\r\npreachers, even to the shedding of blood.\r\n\r\nWhile the nobles threw down their gauntlet to the Council in this\r\nformal manner, the main body of the people showed their feeling by\r\nfierce riots against the monks. Churches and monasteries were burnt;\r\nmany monks were driven from Prague, and some priests were killed in\r\nthe riots. The Archbishop of Prague determined to stand by his Order;\r\nand he too fixed on the Communion in both kinds as the dividing line\r\nbetween the two parties. Finding that he could neither prohibit this\r\npractice nor obtain compensation for the injuries done to the clergy,\r\nhe laid Prague under an Interdict.\r\n\r\nThis Interdict became a new source of division. The Utraquists utterly\r\ndisregarded it, and exposed themselves to the charge of rebellion\r\nagainst the Church. The Catholics, on the other hand, scrupulously\r\nrecognised the archbishop’s decree, and therefore felt bound to\r\ncelebrate their services only in the Vys̆ehrad, which was outside the\r\nprohibited area. The Catholic visits to that fortress were compared by\r\nthe Utraquists to the more celebrated pilgrimages to Mecca; and hence\r\nthe name of Mahometan was added to the other terms of abuse, which were\r\nbeing so freely scattered by the rival theologians.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Wenceslaus was wavering and uncertain. He had, indeed,\r\nbeen disposed to accept the Council’s condemnation of the granting\r\nof the Cup to the laity; but he had used his best influence to save\r\nHus, and he had resented his execution, as another proof of that\r\nfaithlessness of Sigismund, of which he had already had such painful\r\nexperience. He refused, however, to join the League which the nobles\r\nhad formed to defend the liberties of Bohemia, partly, perhaps, because\r\nthey connected it with a defence of the practice just condemned by the\r\nCouncil; and he even consented to support an Opposition League formed\r\nby the Catholic nobles in defence of the Church.\r\n\r\nSigismund, on his part, began to entertain hopes that he might contrive\r\nto sow division between these rival parties; and, feeling that his\r\nshare in the death of Hus was the point which prevented his success in\r\nthese intrigues, he wrote to the Bohemian nobles assuring them that\r\nhe deeply regretted that death, that he had done his best to prevent\r\nit, and that, if Hus had only consented to come under the Emperor’s\r\nprotection to Constance, instead of starting alone from Prague, all\r\nwould have been well; but he added that he could not have saved Hus at\r\nthe last, without breaking up the Council altogether. Whether these\r\nfalsehoods deceived any one may be doubted. At any rate they did not\r\naccomplish Sigismund’s immediate purpose; for, when the Bishop of\r\nLitomys̆l arrived, with authority from the Council to suppress heresy\r\nin Bohemia, he received no encouragement either from king or from\r\nnobles, and, when he attempted violence, he was driven out by force.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whatever terms the nobles of Bohemia might have thought right\r\nto make with Sigismund, as the heir to the Bohemian throne, they could\r\nnot, with any credit to themselves, come to terms at this time with\r\nthe Council of Constance. In the same letter in which the nobles\r\nhad condemned the burning of Hus, they had also complained of the\r\nimprisonment of Jerom; and with Jerom it was clear that the Council\r\nwere determined to proceed to extremities. Worn with starvation and\r\nchains, the unfortunate prisoner at last yielded to his persecutors;\r\nand, while his countrymen were protesting against his imprisonment, he\r\nhad consented to recant his errors, and to acknowledge the justice of\r\nthe death of Hus. The Italian cardinals now desired to set him free;\r\nbut the German and Bohemian members of the Council, backed by the\r\nChancellor of the University of Paris, insisted that this recantation\r\nwas not to be trusted, and that Jerom should be further examined as\r\nto his doctrines. Michael de Causis and Stephen Pálec̆ fastened with\r\nrelentless eagerness on their second victim, and, by so doing, they\r\nsaved his honour and reputation, and gave him an opportunity of showing\r\nhis better side.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1416, he was granted a new hearing before the Council; and,\r\nafter having been for some time pestered with questions, he was at\r\nlast allowed to speak for himself. His long oration, filled with\r\nclassical allusions, greatly impressed the Italian scholar, Poggio\r\nBracciolini, who was present on this occasion. But it will scarcely\r\nstrike modern readers as so edifying as the simpler utterances of Hus.\r\nThe conclusion, however, was more worthy of the occasion. It contained\r\na manly and straightforward eulogy on Hus, an expression of his deep\r\nregret at the weakness which had led him to recant, and a declaration\r\nof his adherence to the teaching both of Hus and of Wyclif. Then, on\r\nMay 14, 1416, he was led out to be burnt, and went singing to the stake.\r\n\r\nIf this execution had not been sufficient to prevent a reconciliation\r\nbetween the Bohemians and the Council of Constance, another event of\r\nthe same period would certainly have deepened the division between\r\nthem. The Bishop of Olmütz died about this time, and Wenceslaus\r\nnominated a new bishop in his stead. The Council, however, intervened;\r\nand they not only rejected Wenceslaus’s nominee, but they demanded that\r\nhe should accept instead that Bishop of Litomys̆l whom he had just\r\ndriven out of the country as a disturber of the peace, and who was\r\nso deeply hated for his prominent share in the condemnation of Hus.\r\nWenceslaus of course refused, and thereby widened the gulf between\r\nhimself and the orthodox Catholics.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the effect of this consolidation of national\r\nfeeling was speedily weakened by the divisions which had begun to show\r\nthemselves in the Utraquist party. Teachers were coming to the front\r\nwho demanded far more sweeping reforms than those which Jakaubek of\r\nKladrau and the other friends of Hus were at all disposed to approve;\r\nand they wished to enforce these reforms by the extremest violence. As\r\nthese reforms were aimed, not only at abuses in the Church, but also\r\nat the influence of the wealthy men in the State, the Reformers soon\r\nroused against them the fears and anger of the well-to-do citizens of\r\nPrague. Nor were these alarms likely to be modified when it became\r\nevident that two men, at least, of important position and remarkable\r\nability, were disposed to place themselves at the head of the reforming\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe leader who first attracted the attention of the crowd and the fears\r\nof the King was Nicholaus of Hus, the Guardian of the Fortress of Hus,\r\nand the proprietor of the village of Husinec. He had been a favourite\r\nwith the King, and was reputed, even by his enemies, to be a man of\r\ngreat ability and insight. He now gathered together such great crowds\r\nof people for prayer and preaching that Wenceslaus began to suspect him\r\nof aiming at the throne. But the more pacific abilities of Nicholaus\r\nwere soon to be thrown into the shade by his fiercer and more brilliant\r\nally, John Z̆iz̆ka of Troc̆nov.\r\n\r\nThough Z̆iz̆ka, like Nicholaus, had been a favourite at Court, he\r\nhad already once offended the king by a daring act of independence.\r\nInfluenced, no doubt, by Sigismund and his friends, Wenceslaus had at\r\none time supported the Order of Teutonic Knights in their struggle\r\nagainst the King of Poland. The anti-German feeling in Bohemia was\r\nalready running high, even at that time; and sympathy with their\r\nSlavonic kinsmen induced many Bohemian officers to hasten to the\r\nsupport of the Poles, in opposition to the wish of the King. In this\r\nsemi-rebellious movement Z̆iz̆ka had taken a prominent part; but he\r\nhad, since then, been pardoned and received back into favour. His\r\nindependent spirit, however, was ill-suited to a Court life, and he\r\nwas not long in giving new offence to Wenceslaus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARKET-PLACE OF PRACHATICE, THE TOWN WHERE HUS AND\r\nZ̆IZ̆KA WENT TO SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\nTradition gives an early date to the first signs of sympathy between\r\nZ̆iz̆ka and Hus. Within a walk of the village of Husinec stands the old\r\ntown of Prachatice, where the ruins are still shown of the school in\r\nwhich Z̆iz̆ka and Hus are said to have studied together. However this\r\nmay be, there can be no doubt that it was very soon after the death of\r\nHus that Z̆iz̆ka began to assume that position of leadership among the\r\nextremer Utraquists, which ultimately gained him such fame both among\r\nfriends and enemies. This section of Reformers had already discovered\r\nthat they did not receive that sympathy from the citizens of Prague\r\nwhich they believed to be their due. Many of them were compelled to\r\nleave the city; and they gathered together on a mountain near Austi,\r\nto which they gave the name of Tabor, and to which their supporters\r\ngradually flocked from all parts of the kingdom. These gatherings so\r\nalarmed Wenceslaus that they even weakened his hostility to the Council\r\nof Constance; and not only the followers of Nicholaus and Z̆iz̆ka,\r\nbut even some of the more moderate Utraquists became objects of his\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\nThis change of feeling naturally increased the hopes of Sigismund,\r\nand he became even more sanguine of success, and more bitter against\r\nthe followers of Hus, when the Council of Constance elected, under\r\nthe name of Pope Martin V., that Cardinal Colonna, who had urged upon\r\nJohn XXIII. the first proposal for the condemnation of Hus. Under\r\nthe influence of this new Pope, all the schemes of reform, which the\r\nCouncil had once thought of considering, were sacrificed to the one\r\naim of the suppression of heresy; and in April, 1418, the Pope secured\r\nhimself a freer hand by dissolving the Council of Constance.\r\n\r\nUrged, then, by pressure from Emperor and Pope, and by his own fear of\r\nUtraquistic excesses, Wenceslaus banished one of the Reformers from\r\nPrague, and recalled the Catholic clergy, who had been expelled from\r\nthe city. He discovered, indeed, that Utraquism had taken so deep a\r\nroot in Prague that it would be necessary to grant at least three\r\nchurches to its preachers. But this concession did not satisfy the more\r\nzealous champions of the cause; and the favour shown by the King to the\r\nCatholics provoked riots among the Reformers. Then Wenceslaus demanded\r\nthat the citizens should all give up their arms to him.\r\n\r\nZ̆iz̆ka now saw that the controversy with the Catholics must sooner\r\nor later end in war; and he was determined that his followers should\r\nnot be unprovided for such a struggle. He therefore resolved to obey\r\nthe royal summons, but in a peculiar manner of his own. He gathered\r\ntogether his followers, led them into the presence of the King, and\r\nassured him that they were ready to stand by him, with life and\r\nproperty, against his enemies. The unfortunate Wenceslaus felt bound to\r\nthank Z̆iz̆ka and his followers for this loyal declaration; but Z̆iz̆ka\r\nknew well enough that he had thereby forfeited the royal favour. He\r\ntherefore quickly retired from Court, and joined Nicholaus of Hus in\r\norganising their followers on Mount Tabor. The alarm of Wenceslaus\r\nwas naturally increased by these proceedings; and he began to meet\r\nthe opposition by deposing the Town Councillors in the different\r\ndivisions of Prague, and thrusting in their opponents. This was a more\r\narbitrary act of power than he had yet resorted to in this struggle;\r\nand it naturally hastened on the violent crisis which had long been\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nThe quarter in which the outbreak finally took place had a peculiar\r\ncharacter of its own, which some historians believe to have affected\r\nthe character of the coming struggle. It will be remembered that\r\nCharles IV. had done much, not merely to develop the intellectual\r\ngreatness of Prague, but also to increase its physical size. A\r\ncompletely new suburb had been added during that reign, which was\r\nknown as the New Town of Prague. This division of the city was\r\ngoverned by its own Council, and rapidly assumed a peculiar character.\r\nCharles’s policy attracted many Germans to the city; and, while the\r\nmore prominent struggle between the rival “Nations” of the University\r\nhad been growing in intensity, it is believed by some that an equally\r\nbitter feeling had been springing up among those Bohemian workmen who\r\nhad fallen under the rule of German employers of labour. The historians\r\nwho hold this view maintain that the workmen, who desired to escape\r\nfrom this domination, fled from the older parts of Prague, and found\r\nnew possibilities of life and of organisation in the New Town. Whether\r\nthis migration can be clearly proved or no, it is certain that, both\r\nat this and later crises, there appears a more democratic and, in some\r\nrespects, a more national spirit in the movements which had their rise\r\nin the New Town, than in those of other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nIt was then, in the church of St. Stephen, in the New Town, that on\r\nthe 30th of July, 1419, a fiery preacher named John of Seelau (Zelív)\r\ndelivered a sermon in the presence of an excited crowd of the followers\r\nof Z̆iz̆ka. After being worked up by pictures of the coming judgment,\r\nthese fiery reformers marched in procession through the streets. As\r\nthey passed the Council House, some insult appears to have been offered\r\nthem by those who were looking out of the windows; whereupon the\r\ninfuriated Utraquists rushed upstairs into the council chamber, and\r\nhurled the newly-elected Councillors from the window, the crowd below\r\nreceiving the falling men on the points of their spikes. Then Z̆iz̆ka\r\nand his friends proceeded to seize the town into their hands, elected\r\nfour captains for each district, and appointed Councillors in the place\r\nof those who had been killed.\r\n\r\nWenceslaus was furious at this news, and vowed that he would\r\nexterminate all Wyclifites and Hussites. Many of his advisers, however,\r\nwere still in sympathy with the principle of Utraquism; and they\r\npersuaded the King to come to terms with the rioters, and to confirm\r\nthe election of the new Councillors. The excitement of the controversy\r\nand the humiliation of this confession were too much for the strength\r\nof Wenceslaus. He was seized with a fever; and, in August, 1419, ended\r\nat last his long and tragic reign.\r\n\r\nThe concessions into which Wenceslaus had been persuaded by his queen\r\nand his nobles, produced less effect on the minds of the citizens of\r\nPrague than the violent threats which had preceded them; and, at the\r\ntime of his death, the feeling against him was so fierce that his\r\nfriends did not venture to give him a public funeral, but buried him\r\nsecretly by night. A still plainer evidence of this feeling was shown\r\nin the renewal of the riots against the monks. Altars, organs, and\r\nimages of saints were destroyed; and many of the monks were driven out\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the nobles who had been hitherto inclined to the Utraquist\r\ncause, were so much alarmed at these excesses that they called upon\r\nSigismund, as next heir to the throne, to hasten to Bohemia, to restore\r\norder. The messengers found him preparing to start on an expedition\r\nagainst the Turks; and his German and Hungarian councillors persuaded\r\nhim to delay his visit to Bohemia, until he could enter it at the head\r\nof a victorious army. He therefore appointed Wenceslaus’s widow Sophia\r\nas regent in his place; and he chose a council to assist her, of which\r\nthe most prominent member was C̆enĕk of Wartenberg.\r\n\r\nC̆enĕk was one of those men who will always receive more condemnation\r\nand less pity than are their due. He was evidently a man of some\r\nattractive qualities, and, originally at least, of excellent\r\nintentions. He had taken the lead in the protest against the execution\r\nof Hus; and, if he had shown himself somewhat too tolerant towards\r\nthe early excesses of Z̆iz̆ka and his friends, he had at least helped\r\nto preserve Wenceslaus from being driven by those acts into the arms\r\nof Sigismund. But to steer the kingdom through the dangers with which\r\nit was threatened by the fierce intolerance of Sigismund on the one\r\nhand, and of Z̆iz̆ka on the other, required stronger nerve and clearer\r\npurpose than C̆enĕk possessed; and thus his continual changes of party\r\nwere effected in a manner which have left a deep stain on his memory.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bohemian Assembly first met to consider the position of\r\naffairs, it seemed as if the moderate Utraquists would be able\r\nto carry the day; for a resolution was passed that the Estates\r\nwould only consent to the coronation of Sigismund on the following\r\nconditions: First, that he would permit the Communion in both kinds\r\nto be celebrated in all the churches, and would try to procure the\r\nsanction of the Pope to this practice. Secondly, that he would place\r\nno clergy in temporal authority. Thirdly, that he would not permit the\r\npublication of any Papal Bulls until they had received the approval of\r\nthe King’s Council. Fourthly, that he would not appoint any foreigners\r\nto either temporal or spiritual offices, nor set German magistrates\r\nover towns where Bohemians dwelt. Lastly, that the proceedings of the\r\nlaw-courts should be conducted in the Bohemian language. These were the\r\nprincipal demands of the nobles; but the citizens of Prague, who were\r\ndaily gaining greater influence in the councils of the State, added\r\ncertain conditions of their own. These were that Sigismund should grant\r\nan amnesty for the recent disturbances; that he should not permit the\r\nestablishment in Prague of any more houses of ill-fame; and that he\r\nshould permit the reading of at least the Gospel and Epistle in the\r\nBohemian language. Such a programme might seem to unite for the moment\r\nall sections of Bohemians who desired peace and independence for their\r\ncountry; but, when Sigismund replied by putting aside the whole of\r\nthese demands, and declaring that he would only promise to govern as\r\nhis father had governed before him, the situation was entirely changed.\r\n\r\nStrange as it sounds, in speaking of so turbulent a country, it is\r\nnone the less true that, till this time, there had been no instance\r\nof a combined national resistance in Bohemia to a King who was the\r\nsole lawful claimant of the throne. There had been plenty of instances\r\nof setting up rival members of the royal family against each other;\r\nattempts by discontented nobles to call in a foreign King or Emperor\r\nto their help; and even something like a provincial insurrection of\r\nMoravia against Bohemia; but that the National Assembly of Bohemia\r\nshould formally commit itself to an attempt to exclude from the\r\ncountry the lawful heir to the throne, who was at once the only living\r\nrepresentative of the House of Luxemburg, and the ruler of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire--this was a step so unprecedented that it may well have\r\ncaused hesitation in those who were called upon to take it.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this difficulty might have been avoided if Sophia could have\r\nventured on more independent action. But the Queen, though she had\r\nexercised so useful an influence over her husband during his lifetime,\r\nseems, after his death, to have fallen completely into the background,\r\nand to have taken her cue from Sigismund, or from his principal\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\nThe result, then, of the deliberations of the Bohemian Assembly was\r\nthat the nation was broken up into three parties. These were as\r\nfollows: (1) The Catholic Party, which was in favour of complete\r\nsubmission to Sigismund. (2) The Moderate Utraquist Party which would\r\nhave accepted him if he would have granted some amount of religious\r\nliberty. (3) The Extreme Reforming Party, which thoroughly distrusted\r\nSigismund, and desired to throw off his authority. The first of these\r\nparties found its supporters chiefly in Moravia, and particularly in\r\nthe German-speaking districts of that province. By a strange irony\r\nof fortune, its leader was that Wenceslaus of Duba who had stood so\r\ngallantly by Hus at the Council of Constance. But though he, and one or\r\ntwo others of the party, may have cherished some national aspirations,\r\nthey were, as a body, too much out of sympathy with the keen Slavonic\r\nfeeling of the country to be reckoned as a Bohemian party at all. The\r\nsecond party, which gradually acquired the name of Calixtines, from the\r\nimportance which they attached to the custom of granting the Cup to the\r\nlaity, were really composed of two very different elements. Many of the\r\ngreat nobles, while theoretically zealous for the Cup, were far more\r\nanxious to maintain that position in the country which largely depended\r\non the favour of the king; while, on the other hand, learned preachers\r\nlike Jakaubek of Kladrau were as zealous for the reforms which they\r\ndesired as many of the extremer Utraquists could be, and would have\r\nrisked and sacrificed as much to secure them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE INTO FORTIFIED PART OF TABOR.]\r\n\r\nBut, though men like Jakaubek of Kladrau had an important part to play\r\nin the coming struggle, it was from the third Bohemian party that there\r\nwere to be drawn the most determined fighters, and the most impressive\r\nfigures, in the struggle of Bohemia against the German Emperor. This\r\nparty had been founded by those fiery spirits who had been banished\r\nfrom Prague by Wenceslaus; and they derived their name of Taborite\r\nfrom the mountain which they had made their chief place of refuge\r\nafter their expulsion from Prague. So great was the enthusiasm which\r\nthey caused that, when Wenceslaus forbade any further visits to Tabor\r\nunder penalty of death and confiscation of goods, large numbers of\r\nthe peasantry willingly sacrificed all their possessions, and risked\r\nthe chance of death, to unite themselves with this chosen band. A\r\ncommunity so formed naturally developed very remarkable qualities; and\r\na stern Puritanical gloom, combined with the Puritanical nobleness\r\nof aspiration, rapidly showed itself among them. Rich and poor\r\nshared their food with each other; no strife or theft was permitted;\r\nintoxicating liquors were excluded from the mountain; and not only was\r\ngambling forbidden to the elders, but even the children were deprived\r\nof their games. Such is the account given of the Taborites by a\r\nsomewhat hostile chronicler, who thus proceeds to describe their manner\r\nof passing the day:\r\n\r\n“Having then completed the moderate refreshment of the body, the\r\npriests rise with the people to give thanks to God. They march round\r\nthe Mount of Tabor, bearing the venerable Eucharist--the virgins\r\npreceding the Sacrament, and the men and women in their squadrons\r\nfollowing, all shouting and singing psalms as seems convenient. When\r\nthis procession is finished, they exchange farewells with their clergy,\r\nnot bending to the right or left lest they should trample on the wheat;\r\nand so they come to the place whence they started.” These people,\r\nalready prepared for religious enthusiasm by the stern discipline of\r\nsuch a life as this, were kindled yet further by fiery sermons, founded\r\nchiefly on the visions of the Apocalypse, in which prophecies were\r\ndelivered of the speedy coming of Christ, and the reign of the Saints,\r\nwhich was to be hastened by the putting to death of the enemies of\r\nChrist. They were told that they were to bathe and sanctify their hands\r\nin the blood of their enemies; and that, while they were to imitate the\r\nzeal and indignation of their Master, this was not the time to imitate\r\nHis gentleness. All human learning, said the fiercer of the preachers,\r\nwas to be treated with contempt; and the taking of degrees at the\r\nUniversity was a vanity.\r\n\r\nNor was it only the training, which they had received from their\r\npreachers, that prepared the Taborites for the part which they were\r\nto play in the coming struggle. Z̆iz̆ka was eminently fitted to be\r\nthe hero of a revolutionary party. To a fiery sincerity, and a steady\r\ndevotion to that high ideal of life which was implied in the Taborite\r\ncreed, he united a genius for leadership and organisation which the\r\ngreatest generals might have envied; a statesmanlike instinct for\r\nseizing the right moment and the right course of action; and a savage\r\nferocity which none of his opponents could surpass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE IN TABOR WITH OLD TABORITE COMMUNION TABLE IN\r\nFRONT OF IT.]\r\n\r\nBut, though this fiery band, and their uncompromising leader, were to\r\ngive the tone to the struggle which was fast approaching, one passing\r\nhint was given, before the outbreak of the war, of the presence among\r\nthe Bohemians of gentler spirits who would gain a hearing at a later\r\nand more appropriate time. One or more of those Taborites, who had not\r\nimbibed that contempt for learning which had been inculcated by their\r\nwilder preachers, applied to the Masters of the Prague University, to\r\nknow whether war on behalf of religion was not forbidden by the command\r\nto Peter to put up his sword into his sheath. Jakaubek answered, on\r\nbehalf of his colleagues, that, though a war for the propagation of the\r\nFaith was undoubtedly forbidden to Christians, yet a defensive war for\r\nthe protection of the Faith was certainly lawful.\r\n\r\nThis question, as has been already suggested, has more importance as\r\na prophecy of future religious developments than as a characteristic\r\nutterance of the period. But the answer has a more immediate\r\nsignificance, as indicating a policy which was to separate the learned\r\nprofessors of the University from the more aristocratic section of\r\nthe Calixtines. This difference has already been referred to above;\r\nbut it requires to be emphasized and developed. In the case of C̆enek\r\nof Wartenberg the difference seems to have been partly due to a sense\r\nof loyalty to the House of Luxemburg, and to a shrinking from some of\r\nthe violences in which the Taborites indulged. But C̆enek’s prominent\r\nposition in his party was not due solely to his personal qualities\r\nor even to his personal rank. It was also largely derived from the\r\nguardianship which he possessed over the lands of Rosenberg; and this\r\nposition must also be considered as colouring the character of his\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nUlric von Rosenberg, like his guardian C̆enek, played a somewhat\r\nquestionable and uncertain part in the coming struggle. But the times\r\nand circumstances of his changes of position lead one to attribute to\r\nhim somewhat different motives of action from those which influenced\r\nhis guardian. He seems to have begun his career as a decided Utraquist;\r\nbut his subsequent oppressions of his Utraquist dependents show a\r\nbitterer change of feeling than can be laid to the charge of C̆enek;\r\nwhile his special opposition to Z̆iz̆ka seems to mark the real ground\r\nof his questionable policy. In mere doctrine he may have had some\r\nsympathy with the reforming movement; but he was soon alarmed by the\r\ndemocratic character of the Taborite party and of its leader; and the\r\ngreat power which had been so long wielded by the Rosenbergs, was\r\nthrown, in the main, into the defence of aristocratic privileges and\r\nfeudal rights. For the moment, however, the nobles could put forward\r\nthe excuse that they were supporting the claims of a Queen, who was\r\nnot stained with the blood of Hus, nor committed to an anti-national\r\npolicy; and, it was on her behalf that C̆enek now organised a standing\r\narmy, and seized into his hands several important fortresses.\r\n\r\nZ̆iz̆ka, on his part, felt that no time was to be lost in saving the\r\ncause for which he desired to struggle. So, at the head of a band of\r\nhis drilled peasants, he suddenly marched upon the fortress of the\r\nVys̆ehrad, drove out the royalist garrison, and put his own men in\r\ntheir place. Then, on the 10th of November, the Taborites set out in\r\nvarious bands, from the three or four towns which were occupied by\r\ntheir party; and they marched to Prague, to hold a great meeting\r\nthere. The main body met at the town of Zinkov, where they organised\r\ntheir forces before proceeding on their march. But three hundred men\r\nhad started alone from Austi, apparently ill-armed and ill-prepared for\r\nattack. This detached body was met on its way by one of the royalist\r\nnobles; and on the first attack he put to flight the men of Austi with\r\nmuch slaughter.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives escaped to Knin, at which point the main body of their\r\nfriends had now arrived. Baron von Sternberg, the general of the\r\nroyalists, marched thither to meet the advancing Taborites, and\r\nprobably hoped to obtain an easy victory. But the sturdy peasants\r\nrepelled his attack with such vigour that the royalists were forced to\r\nretreat; and on the 4th of November, 1419, the Taborites entered Prague\r\nwithout further opposition. The royalist party were at once called to\r\narms; while, on the other side, Nicholaus of Hus and Z̆iz̆ka marched\r\ninto the Small Division of Prague, and, after a fierce struggle, seized\r\nupon the great fortress, which still overlooks the town. The Queen fled\r\nfrom Prague under the protection of Ulric of Rosenberg. C̆enek in the\r\nmeantime gathered new forces on her behalf, and persuaded several towns\r\nto declare for the royalist cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE OF MINER WITH MINING LAMP AND STAFF IN CHURCH OF\r\nST. BARBARA AT KUTTENBERG (KUTNA HORA).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KUTNA HORA, OFFICE WHERE THE COINS WERE STRUCK BY THE\r\nITALIANS BROUGHT TO KUTNA HORA BY WENCESLAUS II.]\r\n\r\nEach party was now conscious of the strength of its opponents; and,\r\nunder such circumstances, those moderate citizens of Prague who\r\ncombined a zeal for freedom with a desire for peace, were able to\r\nhold the balance between the contending parties. So a compromise was\r\neffected, by which the queen and the nobles were pledged to protect\r\nreligious liberty and especially Communion in both kinds; while the\r\ncitizens, on their part, consented to restore the fortress of Vys̆ehrad\r\nto the Queen, and to abstain from any injuries to churches or images.\r\nZ̆iz̆ka, however, distrusted the Queen’s party, and was discontented\r\nwith these terms. So he withdrew with most of his troops to his chief\r\nfortress of Pilsen (Plz̆en).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWN COUNCIL HOUSE OF PILSEN (PLZEN).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the recovery of the Vys̆ehrad was an important gain to the\r\nroyalist cause, the great centre of the extreme Catholic feeling was\r\nthe town of Kutna Hora. That town, from its importance as a mining\r\ncentre, and from the special favour shown to it by the kings, had\r\nbecome a kind of rival to Prague; and in a time of civil war such\r\nrivalry naturally ripened into active hostility of the fiercest\r\ndescription. In spite of the occasional fierceness of such outbursts\r\nas that which had produced the slaughter of the Councillors of the\r\nNew Town, there had been, till now, little organised cruelty in the\r\ncontest between the two parties. Now, however, whether actuated by\r\nmunicipal rivalry or religious hostility, the men of Kutna Hora began\r\nto inaugurate a system of persecution which was to produce terrible\r\nreprisals. They seized upon all the Utraquists whom they could find,\r\nand even paid other towns so much a head to send them victims. Some\r\nof these they buried alive in pits; some they burnt, and some they\r\nbeheaded; so that in a short time more than sixteen hundred had been\r\nput to death.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sigismund had returned from Hungary to Moravia; and in\r\nChristmas, 1419, he and Queen Sophia held a meeting at Brünn (Brno).\r\nThe citizens of Prague sent a deputation to this assembly to entreat\r\nfor terms of peace. Sigismund ordered them at once to pull down all the\r\nchains which they had placed across the streets; to destroy all their\r\nnew fortifications; and to bring back the Catholic priests who had been\r\ndriven out. The citizens were so anxious to avoid a collision with\r\nSigismund that they consented to these terms; and they destroyed their\r\nfortifications amid the jeers of the Catholics and Germans.\r\n\r\nZ̆iz̆ka now fully realised the impossibility of any compromise, and\r\nhe prepared for a desperate struggle. His first intention had been to\r\nmake the town of Pilsen the centre of his operations. From that town he\r\nhad succeeded in driving out all the Catholics; and its fortifications\r\nwere so strong that he hoped to make it good against all comers. But\r\nthe growing strength of the fortress of Tabor led him to change his\r\nopinion; and he decided to withdraw from Pilsen, and to concentrate\r\nthe whole force of his followers on the mountain from which they\r\ntook their name. According to one account, the divisions in Pilsen\r\nitself were the main cause of this decision. Certainly some special\r\nexplanation is needed of a step which proved, in one way, so disastrous\r\nto the reforming cause; for, during all the victories gained by the\r\nUtraquists, they were never able to recover this important fortress\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, unconditionally that Z̆iz̆ka consented to abandon\r\nthis position. He stipulated that he should be allowed to depart\r\nfreely to Tabor, and that the granting of the Cup to the laity should\r\nbe permitted in Pilsen. Wenceslaus of Duba, as leader of the Catholic\r\nforces, consented to the terms which Z̆iz̆ka proposed. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, the doctrine that faith should not be kept with heretics had\r\nalready taken deep root amongst the opponents of the Utraquists. While\r\nZ̆iz̆ka was still on his way from Pilsen to Tabor, he was attacked by\r\nPeter of Sternberg, at the head of a royalist force. Unprepared for\r\nthis attack, and very inferior in the number of his forces, Z̆iz̆ka at\r\nfirst retreated before his enemies; but, finding himself compelled to\r\nfight, he took up his position on the bank of a fish-pond near the town\r\nof Sudomír. There, for the first time, he adopted the plan which became\r\na special characteristic of his battles. He entrenched himself behind\r\nhis baggage-waggons, over which his men fired at the advancing foe. The\r\nstruggle was a fierce one; but at last the royalists were compelled to\r\nretreat, and Z̆iz̆ka went on in safety to Tabor.\r\n\r\nBut though much of the success of the Utraquist wars was due to the\r\nenergy of Z̆iz̆ka and his followers, the leading citizens of Prague\r\nhad also a very important influence on the struggle; and Sigismund’s\r\nactions soon roused in them that desperate courage which had seemed\r\nfor a moment to forsake them. The nickname of Sigismund, “Super\r\nGrammaticam,” has been fixed on this Emperor by Carlyle; but an even\r\nmore distinctive name would have been Sigismund “Super Veritatem.” Many\r\nother rulers have told lies in their time of emergency; but surely no\r\none ever took so much pains to write himself down a liar as Sigismund\r\ndid at every stage of his career. It will be remembered that he had\r\nwritten most urgently to the Bohemians, to express his regret for the\r\ndeath of Hus, and to assure them that he had done all he could to\r\nprevent it. Yet, as soon as Pope Martin had published his Bull, urging\r\na crusade against the Hussites, Sigismund seized upon a merchant of\r\nPrague named Krasa, and publicly burnt him in Breslau, on the express\r\nground that he had disapproved of the burning of Hus and Jerom.\r\n\r\nC̆enek of Wartenberg, who had been entrusted by Sigismund with the\r\ncare of the fortress of Prague, now declared that he could no longer\r\nserve the king. At nearly every stage in the career of this unfortunate\r\nnobleman, his change of opinion, however excusable in itself, was\r\nstained by some act of treachery. On this occasion he invited the\r\nsubordinate governors of the castle to dinner, and seized that\r\nopportunity for arresting and imprisoning them. Having thus mastered\r\nthe castle, he placed it under the care of the citizens of Prague.\r\nHe then arrested seventy-six of the clergy, and drove several of the\r\nopposing citizens from the town.\r\n\r\nBut C̆enek was never long of one mind; and he soon began to despair\r\nof the struggle on which he had entered. On the one hand the Catholic\r\ndefenders of the Vys̆ehrad held out successfully against his attacks;\r\nand at the same time he seems to have been sincerely shocked at the\r\noutrages committed by the Taborites. In the early outbursts, though\r\nthere had been much plundering and some bloodshed, there had been\r\nlittle deliberate cruelty. Now, however, Z̆iz̆ka began to imitate only\r\ntoo closely the cruelties of the Kuttenberger; for finding a number of\r\nmonks in a castle which he had stormed, he burnt them alive after the\r\nvictory was over. When this cruelty was followed by the destruction of\r\nmany churches and monasteries, C̆enek began to shrink from the cause\r\nwhich he had defended, and to urge the citizens of Prague to come to\r\nterms with Sigismund. Finding, however, that he was unable to persuade\r\nthem to take this course, he resolved secretly to betray the castle to\r\nSigismund, on the understanding that the Communion in both kinds should\r\nbe permitted on C̆enek’s own estates. Sigismund apparently consented\r\nto this arrangement; and C̆enek secretly admitted into the castle four\r\nthousand of the royalist soldiers, of whom many were Germans. Furious\r\nat this treachery, the citizens made so fierce an attack upon the\r\ncastle that C̆enek was panic-struck and fled secretly to Sigismund.\r\nBut the attack was made without organisation or arrangement and the\r\ncitizens were repelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE OF PRAGUE.]\r\n\r\nSeveral noblemen had followed C̆enek in his desertion of the national\r\ncause; and at last the citizens decided to send a new embassy to\r\nSigismund, under the protection of Wenceslaus of Duba. Sigismund’s\r\nhope and indignation had alike been raised by the recent events; and\r\nhe demanded that the citizens should surrender all their arms to the\r\ndefenders of the Vys̆ehrad. On receiving this demand, the Town Council\r\nof Prague sent defiance to the king, and resolved to fight till the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nBoth parties now prepared for action; and, while Sigismund was issuing\r\nan appeal to all citizens and princes to come to help him against\r\nhis rebellious subjects, Z̆iz̆ka and Nicholaus of Hus were preparing\r\nto march to Prague at the head of their Taborite forces. Many of the\r\nworkmen and peasants were now beginning to stir themselves for the\r\nnational cause; and, before Sigismund could secure the help of the\r\nElectors of the Empire, he was to have a slight taste of the dangers\r\nwhich he was about to encounter. The Kutna Hora miners had roused much\r\nopposition by their cruelties on behalf of the royalist cause; and the\r\ncharcoal burners, who had hitherto been dependent upon them, had now\r\nrevolted against them. After vainly attempting to pacify their new\r\nopponents, the Kuttenberger appealed to Sigismund, and he sent them a\r\ndetachment of the royal troops. The charcoal burners met the soldiers\r\nwith stones and arrows; and, cheered on by a Taborite priest, they\r\ndrove back the royalists in confusion to the mountains. The priest,\r\nhowever, was wounded; and the charcoal burners then retreated.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Z̆iz̆ka and his forces were on their march. Their\r\nimportance was now recognised by their opponents; and Wenceslaus of\r\nDuba attempted to intercept them. Z̆iz̆ka encountered the royalists\r\nnear Porc̆ic, signally defeated them, and entered Prague in triumph on\r\nthe 20th of May, 1420.\r\n\r\nThe powerful help of the new-comers was doubtless welcomed by the\r\ncitizens of Prague; but they speedily discovered that differences\r\nof habit and feeling were likely to produce as many difficulties in\r\nthe relations of the two parties to each other, as had already been\r\nproduced by differences of doctrine. Both sections of the Utraquist\r\nParty had desired to introduce a purer life and simpler habits; and\r\nin many cases they had taken steps to enforce them. But the Taborite\r\nideal, and still more the Taborite methods of realising it, differed\r\nconsiderably from those of the comfortable and orderly citizens of\r\nPrague. The latter, it appeared, indulged in delicately trimmed beards\r\nand moustachios; their wives wore trains, which seemed to the Taborites\r\nunduly long; and the hair of the younger ladies fell in long and\r\ncuriously made plaits on their shoulders. The sturdy peasant reformers\r\nresolved summarily to correct these evils; so they seized the citizens\r\nin the streets, and compulsorily shaved them, cut off the trains of\r\ntheir wives’ dresses, and even shortened the locks of the girls. The\r\ncitizens naturally objected to such strong methods of reform; and\r\nthe Taborite captains cut short these proceedings by sending their\r\nfollowers to dig trenches for the defence of the town.\r\n\r\nBut the value of the new defenders was soon proved; for a force of\r\nroyalist troops on their way to the castle at Prague, were completely\r\ncut to pieces by a sally of the Taborites; and when Sigismund at last\r\nadvanced against the city, the approach of this fierce peasant army,\r\nwielding the spiked flails which were generally their only weapon,\r\nstruck him with such fear that he at once abandoned the siege of\r\nPrague, and devoted himself to more easy enterprises. Nor were the\r\nnobles of Bohemia more fortunate in their efforts. Ulric of Rosenberg,\r\nwho had followed C̆enek in his desertion of the popular cause, was\r\ndriven back from Tabor by Nicholaus of Hus, and confined himself for a\r\ntime to imprisoning and starving the Utraquist priests whom he found on\r\nhis lands.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the appeal of the Pope and the Emperor for a crusade\r\nagainst the Utraquists was producing its effect. Not only from Germany,\r\nbut from various parts of Hungary, Spain, France, England, and Holland,\r\nand in some cases even from Poland, trained warriors came to join\r\nSigismund’s army.\r\n\r\nProminent amongst the German princes was Frederick of Hohenzollern. He\r\nhad been secured to Sigismund’s cause by a transaction which roused new\r\nbitterness in Bohemia against the Emperor. It may be remembered that\r\nCharles IV. had added Brandenburg to the Bohemian kingdom. Thomas of\r\nS̆títný, and other stern moralists, had objected to this acquisition,\r\nconsidering it as a mere act of personal aggrandisement, and of no\r\nreal benefit to the kingdom. But, in the history of every country,\r\nthere have been additions of territory which, however questionable in\r\ntheir origin, have afterwards roused on their behalf a strong national\r\nfeeling. Nor must it be forgotten that the circumstances, under which\r\nSigismund surrendered this territory, certainly justified considerable\r\nindignation on the part of the Bohemians. In 1415, four years before\r\nhe was actually King of Bohemia, without any consultation with\r\nWenceslaus or the Bohemian Assembly, Sigismund handed over Brandenburg\r\nto Frederick of Hohenzollern, whose ancestor had so actively assisted\r\nRudolf in the conquest of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that the national feeling against Germans in general,\r\nand the Hohenzollerns in particular, was not limited to the Utraquists,\r\nbut was shared even by those Bohemian nobles who followed Sigismund in\r\nbattle. So intense was this hatred that the Bohemians and their allies\r\nhad to be quartered in different parts of the field; and doubtless this\r\ndisagreement was one cause of the strange delay in the operations of\r\nthe army which followed their arrival before Prague. Two weeks were\r\nspent by the captains of the host in raids upon the neighbouring towns,\r\nwhence they brought in Utraquist priests whom they burnt in the camp.\r\nOne occasion is specially noted by the chronicler, in which three old\r\nmen and four boys were brought in, in company with their priest. These\r\nprisoners, after having been struck and insulted for some time, were\r\nordered to abjure the practice of Communion in both kinds, and when\r\nthey refused, were burnt. During all this time Z̆iz̆ka was working at\r\nthe fortifications of a hill which overlooks the town, and from which\r\nhe hoped to conduct the defence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF PRAGUE SHOWING Z̆IZ̆KA’S HILL TO THE NORTH-EAST.]\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 14th of July, the invading army grew weary of its\r\ndelays, and prepared for a general attack on various parts of the city.\r\nIn this plan the invaders were to be aided by the garrisons which\r\noccupied respectively the fortress of the Vys̆ehrad and the castle\r\nof Prague. The battle began by an attempt to storm the hill which\r\nZ̆iz̆ka had fortified. This attack was undertaken by the Margrave\r\nof Meissen, the hereditary enemy of the Bohemians. As his soldiers\r\ncharged up the hill they were encountered, not only by Z̆iz̆ka’s\r\nforces, but also by private citizens, and even by women. The stones\r\nhurled by these defenders produced such effect that the first attack\r\nwas repelled. But the Germans quickly returned to the charge; nor\r\ncould the desperate courage of the defenders wholly prevent their\r\nadvance. One of the Germans seized on a woman who was defending the\r\nhill; but she vowed that she would not yield to anti-Christ, and\r\nshe was killed in defending herself. Still the invaders pressed on.\r\nZ̆iz̆ka was himself wounded and struck down, and was with difficulty\r\nrescued by the flails of his followers. The Germans had almost reached\r\nthe top of the hill, when suddenly the gate of the city, which stood\r\nnearest to the hill on the other side, was thrown open, and a priest\r\ncame out bearing the Sacrament, and followed by fifty archers, and\r\nsome more of the flail-bearing peasants. At the same moment all the\r\nbells in the city were set ringing; and, with a great shout, echoed\r\nfrom within the walls, the new-comers rushed up the hill to meet the\r\nadvancing enemy. Immediately the invaders were seized with a panic and\r\nfled; three hundred of them were killed in the descent, and others\r\ndangerously wounded. Sigismund’s forces retreated to their tents, and\r\nthe citizens of Prague hastened to their churches to return thanks for\r\ntheir victory. The scene of this battle was called by some Bojiste (the\r\nbattlefield) in consequence of the great slaughter of the Germans;\r\nothers called it the Hill of the Cup; but the name which has driven out\r\nevery other is that which connects it with the general of the day; and\r\nit is still known as Z̆iz̆kov Hora--the hill of Z̆iz̆ka.\r\n\r\nIt might have seemed that such a victory, however startling, would\r\nscarcely have ended a war, begun with so great preparation, and engaged\r\nin by so formidable an army. But the bitter feeling between the German\r\nand Bohemian Royalists had now risen to such a height as to make common\r\naction impossible. On the one hand, the Germans furiously accused the\r\nBohemians of having betrayed them in the battle; and, in revenge for\r\nthis supposed treachery, they attacked and burnt some of the houses in\r\nthe outlying villages, and threw the women and children into the fire.\r\nThe Bohemians, on the other hand, were more and more disposed to make\r\npeace with their countrymen; and it will be remembered that some of the\r\nnobles had already shown an inclination to Utraquism. As for Sigismund,\r\nhis first and main thought was to secure the crown of Bohemia to\r\nhimself with the smallest amount of trouble.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the Bohemian part of the army willingly\r\nentered into negotiations with the defenders of the city; and the\r\nlatter proposed, for Sigismund’s acceptance, four Articles of Peace,\r\nwhich were to become very famous in the following years. The first\r\nof these was the free preaching of the Word of God; the second, the\r\ngranting of the Cup to the laity; the third, the removal of the clergy\r\nfrom rule in secular affairs, and their restriction to the apostolic\r\nmode of life; the fourth was the public suppression of deadly sins.\r\nSigismund consented to discussion on these points between the Utraquist\r\npreachers and the Catholic priests, who had followed his army. The\r\nleading orator on the Utraquist side was John Pr̆zibram, a man who was\r\nto play a conspicuous part in the coming controversies.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, it was found that the Catholic clergy were willing\r\nto make many concessions in the discussion. But the Conference broke\r\ndown on a point which may be called the main issue of the Later\r\nReformation--the question, namely, whether, in cases of doubt, the\r\ndeciding authority should be the Church or the Scriptures. Perhaps few\r\ncould have expected that the clerical disputants would have come to an\r\nagreement; and the Bohemian Royalists did not seem to have been shaken\r\nby this result in their desire for peace. Indeed, such readiness did\r\nthey show to accept the Four Articles, that the citizens of Prague\r\nconsidered their cause secure, and consented to elect Sigismund as\r\ntheir King. So on July 28, 1420, Sigismund, having given a general\r\npromise to govern better, was solemnly crowned at Prague; and two days\r\nlater the great army of Crusaders returned, cursing the King as a\r\nbreaker of his word and a favourer of heretics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FIRST CORONATION OF SIGISMUND TO THE OPENING OF COUNCIL OF\r\nBASEL.\r\n\r\n(1420-1431.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dramatic circumstances of Sigismund’s coronation at\r\nPrague, any hopes of peace or reconciliation, which the citizens may\r\nhave entertained, at the moment, were speedily to be frustrated, partly\r\nby the bitter divisions in the Utraquist camp, partly by the incurably\r\nuntrustworthy character of the king whom they had chosen. The former\r\ndifficulty was the one which first forced itself on public attention.\r\nThe Taborites had taken the leading part in the victory which had\r\njust been won; and they resolved that their will should be felt in\r\nthe settlement which was to follow it. Furious at the recent burning\r\nof their friends before the very eyes of the citizens, they demanded\r\nthat these murders should be revenged by the burning of the prisoners\r\nwho had been taken in the battle; and the rulers of the city yielded\r\nto their wishes. Elated by this success, the Taborites insisted that\r\ntwelve new Articles should be added to the four which had been already\r\nset forth by the Calixtines. Most of these new proposals were in the\r\ndirection of more vigorous provisions for punishing self-indulgence and\r\nimmorality. But the bitter national feeling manifests itself in the\r\ndemand for the complete establishment of the law of God, in the place\r\nof those pagan and _Teutonic_ laws, which do not agree with the laws\r\nof God. Further, all the revenues of the priests were to be seized for\r\nthe public good; usury was to be suppressed; all enemies of the truth\r\nto be expelled; all heretical monasteries and all unnecessary churches,\r\naltars, and ornaments to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of these proposals was marked by the first public\r\nappearance in Bohemia of a man who was to play a remarkable part in the\r\ncoming struggle. This was Peter Payne, an English Master of Arts, who\r\nhad been forced to fly from Oxford on account of his sympathy with the\r\ndoctrines of Wyclif. He had been welcomed by the scholars of Prague,\r\nand had been admitted to a Master’s Degree at their University also.\r\nAlthough his doctrinal Protestantism had led him to conclusions far\r\nbeyond those adopted by any Bohemian party, yet his English sense of\r\njustice and love of compromise often marked him out as a go-between and\r\nmoderator in the controversies of his adopted countrymen. He now came\r\nforward to suggest the senses in which the Articles of the Taborites\r\nmight be accepted, without injury to either party. But, although the\r\nCalixtines were anxious to find a method of reconciliation with the\r\nTaborites, the latter were guided on this occasion by much fiercer\r\nspirits than Peter Payne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe chief of these extreme advisers was John of Z̆elív, who had so\r\nexcited the Utraquists, on the occasion of that first riot, when the\r\nCouncillors of the New Town were thrown out of the windows. He now\r\ndemanded the deposition of those Councillors of the Old Town who were\r\nopposed to the Taborite doctrines. This point, too, was conceded; yet,\r\nfor some reason, not clearly ascertainable, the Taborites were still\r\ndissatisfied, and on August 22nd they left Prague.\r\n\r\nBut the second hindrance to the establishment of peace in Bohemia was\r\nto have an even more marked effect in hastening on the new war. It\r\nwas not only the Taborites who distrusted their new ruler; Sigismund\r\nsoon provoked against him many of those who had been most desirous for\r\npeace. One of the first points which roused their opposition, was his\r\ndemand that the ornaments of the churches and the royal treasure should\r\nbe used for the payment of the foreign soldiers, who had just been\r\nemployed in the invasion of Bohemia. He also began to renew the old and\r\nevil policy of pledging the monasteries and the royal castles to the\r\nnobles. Lastly, although he had encouraged the citizens to hope that he\r\nwould sanction the Four Articles, he still declined to give them any\r\nformal approval, or even to make arrangements for a discussion upon\r\nthem; nor would he give the citizens any security against the attacks\r\nof those fierce Catholics who still held the fortresses of Prague\r\nand Vys̆ehrad. These divisions of opinions were obviously too vital\r\nto permit of any friendly understanding between the two parties. So\r\nSigismund soon after left Prague; and the suspicions between king and\r\npeople rapidly ripened to a violent solution of their differences.\r\n\r\nSigismund had now adopted, to the full, the principle that no faith\r\nwas to be kept with heretics; and, while he assured the Praguer of his\r\ndesire for peace, he was appealing to the Pope and the electors to join\r\na second crusade for the suppression of the heretics. The citizens\r\nfirst fully realised the treacherous character of Sigismund’s policy\r\nwhen they began to renew their attacks on the Vys̆ehrad. The possession\r\nof this fortress by the Catholics was a continual danger to the city;\r\nyet, when the Utraquists sent their next deputation to Sigismund, to\r\nentreat its acceptance of the Four Articles, he demanded that, even\r\nbefore the Articles should be discussed, the citizens of Prague should\r\nabandon their siege of the Vys̆ehrad. This demand received a still more\r\nstartling interpretation a short time after, when the Town Council\r\nintercepted a letter from the king to the defenders of the fortress,\r\nurging them to make a sudden attack on the city, which he would second\r\nfrom another point.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty the citizens now persuaded Nicholaus of Hus to\r\nbring a force of the Taborites to their help. The king had secretly\r\narranged to send ships down the Moldau to the defence of the Vys̆ehrad;\r\nand the citizens had put chains across the island which lies below the\r\nfortress, so as to hinder the ships from passing. Nicholaus was set\r\nto guard this island; but not even the sense of a common danger could\r\nstifle the differences between the Calixtine leaders and the captains\r\nof the Taborites. The Royalists, in their fear of starvation, offered\r\nto surrender the Vys̆ehrad, if the king did not relieve them within a\r\ncertain time. This proposal the citizens were willing to accept; but\r\nNicholaus was so indignant at the terms granted to the garrison, that\r\nhe abandoned the island and retired into the city. A nobleman, named\r\nHynek of Crus̆ina, now undertook the defence of the city; and when\r\nSigismund again arrived before it, he found it fortified against him.\r\n\r\nAgain, the division in his camp between the native nobles and his\r\nHungarian and German followers speedily showed itself. Some Moravian\r\nbarons advised him to abandon the attack, and frankly owned that they\r\nfeared the flails of the rustics. Sigismund, whose sympathies were\r\nbecoming more and more alienated from his countrymen, taunted the\r\nMoravians with cowardice and treachery. They thereupon sprang from\r\ntheir horses and declared that they were ready to go where the king\r\nwould never be. Sigismund then ordered them to occupy a dangerous\r\nand marshy position on the low land in front of the city, while the\r\nHungarians were to charge from a higher point. This double attack was\r\nat first successful, for the Utraquists fled in some confusion. But\r\nHynek rallied their forces, telling them that the Lord would deliver\r\ntheir enemies into their hands. He and Nicholaus of Hus rushed forward\r\ngallantly with the others; and once more the fear of the flails of the\r\nrustics caused a panic among the Catholics. About five hundred of the\r\nRoyalists were either killed or wounded, and the rout was complete.\r\nThen the men of Vys̆ehrad consented to surrender. But though their\r\ncaptors succeeded in conveying them safely into Prague, they could not\r\nsave the church organs and images in the fortress from being destroyed\r\nby the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe war now raged fiercely on both sides; but while, in matters of\r\nphysical cruelty, the Bohemians were as reckless as their opponents,\r\non two important points there was a marked difference between the\r\nconduct of the rival armies. In the first place, the stern morality\r\nof the Utraquist leaders prevented any of those outrages on women\r\nin which the Hungarian soldiers freely indulged; and, secondly, the\r\ndoctrine that no faith should be kept with heretics produced an utter\r\nunscrupulousness on the Imperialist side, in the observance of terms\r\nof truce or surrender, which cannot certainly be alleged, in the same\r\ndegree, against the Bohemian leaders.\r\n\r\nYet, in the middle of their desperate struggle for national existence\r\nagainst German and Hungarian, the Calixtines and Taborites could not be\r\ninduced to suspend their internal quarrels. Z̆iz̆ka, indeed, desired at\r\nfirst to adopt a more conciliatory policy than was customary with his\r\ncolleagues; and he persuaded the Taborites to act with the citizens of\r\nPrague in offering the crown of Bohemia to the King of Poland. But even\r\nhe soon felt compelled to adopt a more aggressive line of action; for\r\nthe Calixtines had been so alarmed at the power of John of Z̆elív, that\r\nthey had prohibited the further introduction of novelties in doctrine,\r\nand had deposed those Councillors of the Old Town who had been\r\nelected under the influence of John. Z̆iz̆ka was so alarmed at these\r\nproceedings, that he abandoned a siege which he was conducting in a\r\ndistant part of Bohemia, and marched against the fortress of R̆íc̆an,\r\nwhich was in the near neighbourhood of Prague.\r\n\r\nThis fortress had long been a danger to the citizens; but they were\r\nperfectly well aware that Z̆iz̆ka’s present motive for marching against\r\nit was a desire to control the deliberations of the Town Councillors.\r\nHynek of Crus̆ina was so indignant at Z̆iz̆ka’s conduct that he threw\r\nup the captaincy of Prague, and not long after adopted the cause of\r\nSigismund. Z̆iz̆ka had his usual good success in the siege; but there\r\nis at least a doubt whether his proceedings were marked by his usual\r\ngood faith. The Calixtine leaders had promised to spare the lives of\r\nthe defenders of the fortress if they would surrender; yet, after the\r\nsurrender was completed, Z̆iz̆ka burnt alive nine of the priests whom\r\nhe found in the garrison. But neither the undoubted cruelty nor the\r\npossible treachery of this proceeding could prevent Z̆iz̆ka’s victory\r\nfrom producing the desired effect on the Calixtines; and they now\r\nconsented to admit the Taborites to a free discussion of the points of\r\ndifference between them and their rivals.\r\n\r\nThis discussion had at least one advantage. It showed clearly what\r\nwas the point which the Taborites looked upon as the vital difference\r\nbetween themselves and the Calixtines. For, when the Masters of\r\nthe Prague University brought forward a long list of subjects of\r\ncontroversy, one of the Taborite leaders complained that they had not\r\ncome there to discuss all those points; but that they simply wished\r\nfor a decision on the question whether they should or should not wear\r\nspecial vestments at the performance of the Mass. Jakaubek of Kladrau\r\nconsented to limit the discussion to this one point; and, although no\r\nresolution was arrived at, the Taborites clearly saw that the majority\r\nin Prague were against them. The fierce spirit of fanaticism, which had\r\nalready led the Taborites into such excesses, now roused them to fury\r\nagainst the Calixtines; and in one town, at least, they proclaimed that\r\nany priest who was found wearing a special dress at the celebration of\r\nthe Mass, should be burned alive in his vestments.\r\n\r\nBut this dangerous division between the thinking and the fighting\r\nforces of the Utraquist party was checked by two events which were both\r\nof considerable importance in the history of the movement. The first of\r\nthese was the death of Nicholaus of Hus, who was thrown from his horse\r\nas he was leaving Prague. This death naturally threw more power into\r\nthe hands of Z̆iz̆ka; and he had always felt, much more strongly than\r\nNicholaus, the necessity of maintaining the alliance with the Calixtine\r\nrulers of Prague. The other event, which drew the more moderate men of\r\nthe two parties together, was the outbreak of a new division in the\r\nranks of the Taborites themselves.\r\n\r\nThat a body, with the origin, constitution, and mode of life which have\r\nbeen already described, should develop new and unexpected phases of\r\nthought, might have been guessed from the beginning of the movement;\r\nbut that the particular doctrine now broached should have caused\r\ndivision among any section of the Utraquists must sound very strange\r\nto modern ears. In any revolt against excessive priestly power, one\r\nwould have expected that such a doctrine as Transubstantiation would\r\nhave been the first to be attacked. Yet, while both Calixtines and\r\nTaborites were fiercely denouncing the civil power of the clergy, while\r\nthey were attacking every outward badge which seemed to separate the\r\nclergy from the laity, they had yet shrunk with horror from any attack\r\non the doctrine of Transubstantiation. When, then, Martinek Hauska, a\r\nleading Taborite preacher, began to denounce this doctrine, he roused\r\nthe fiercest opposition among his Taborite colleagues; and two of their\r\nmore learned members wrote, in February, 1421, to Jakaubek of Kladrau\r\nand John Pr̆zibram, to consult them about the best means for opposing\r\nthis heresy. The answer to that question was only too easily given;\r\nfor, while each party disagreed with every other on the definition\r\nof heresy, there was a striking unanimity about the right method of\r\ndealing with it when defined. So, while the Calixtines burnt one of\r\nthe preachers of the new doctrine in Prague, the Taborites, doubtless\r\nfinding them too numerous for such treatment, forcibly expelled them\r\nfrom Tabor.\r\n\r\nDeserted and repudiated by all their neighbours, these unfortunate\r\nexiles wandered about in the woods, till their destitute condition,\r\nacting on their already excited fancy, drove them into a state of\r\npartial insanity. They plucked off their clothes, and declared that\r\nthey would return to the state of innocence. That men in such a\r\ncondition would fall into acts of impurity seems highly probable; but\r\nit would surely be unjust to believe all the rumours circulated against\r\npeople who had no opportunity of stating their own case. The main\r\nfact, however, of their living habitually without clothes seems to be\r\ngenerally admitted; it was that peculiarity which gained them their\r\nname of Adamites; and it was on that ground that Z̆iz̆ka seized and\r\nburnt fifty of them. They entered the fire smiling, declaring that they\r\nwould reign that day with Christ in heaven.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were weakening the opposition between the Calixtines\r\nand the main body of the Taborites, other causes were securing still\r\nmore positive advantages to the moderate party in Prague. In April,\r\n1421, Kutna Hora at last fell into the hands of the joint armies of\r\nthe Taborites and Calixtines; and this victory was speedily followed\r\nby the capture of the town of Jaromír. Then C̆enĕk of Wartenberg,\r\nUlric of Rosenberg, Hynek of Crus̆ina, and other noblemen who had\r\nrevolted to Sigismund, came back to the Utraquist camp. John of Z̆elív\r\nseems to have been the guide and adviser of the Utraquist forces in\r\nthis campaign, and he compelled C̆enĕk to make public confession of\r\nhis wickedness in having betrayed the castle of Prague to the king.\r\nWhen this concession had been made, the nobles returned to Prague,\r\nand regained for a time some of their old power. That power was\r\nstrengthened by the speedy capture of the castle of Prague, which up to\r\nthis time had held out against the citizens; and the acceptance by the\r\nnobles of the Four Articles seemed to complete the reunion of parties.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1421, a great Assembly was held of nobles, knights, and\r\ncitizens, at which the question was discussed whether they should\r\nonce more recognise Sigismund as their king. The Moravian nobles\r\nwere opposed to his deposition, while the stricter Utraquists were\r\nequally strong against recalling him; and the Estates at last came to a\r\ncurious compromise, which was expressed in the following words: “That\r\nthey will not have Sigismund for their king unless it is the will of\r\nGod, and unless the famous Masters of Prague, the Bohemian lords, the\r\ncommunities of the Taborites, the knights, soldiers, towns, and other\r\nBohemian communities, give their consent thereto.”\r\n\r\nThen a Council of Representatives from all classes of the community was\r\nchosen to manage the affairs of State while the throne was vacant. And,\r\nif there had been anything of hesitation and compromise in the form\r\nof their decree, there was no sign of such feeling in their answer to\r\nthe envoys whom Sigismund had sent to assert his claim to the throne.\r\nThey drew up a long list of their reasons for rejecting him as king.\r\nThe first grounds of complaint were the deaths of Hus, Jerom, and\r\nKrasa, and the encouragement which Sigismund had given to the Crusaders\r\nagainst Bohemia. They then dwelt on his surrender of Brandenburg\r\nwithout the consent of the Assembly; and they wound up their indictment\r\nby denouncing his rejection of the Four Articles. Sigismund answered\r\nthis attack by again repudiating any sanction on his part to the\r\ndeaths of Hus and Jerom; by declaring himself perfectly ready to\r\nhear discussions on the Four Articles; and, finally, by taunting the\r\nUtraquists with their burning of priests and churches.\r\n\r\nBut, although a want of confidence in Sigismund might bind together\r\nfor a time the various sections of the Utraquist party; yet, on the\r\nother hand, the intense distrust which the treachery of C̆enĕk and\r\nthe other nobles had caused, could not be removed by this superficial\r\nappearance of reconciliation. John of Z̆elív, though he had admitted\r\nthe nobles to a kind of absolution, was foremost in mistrusting the\r\nrepentance which had been accompanied with so much humiliation. A\r\nsudden invasion of Bohemia by the Silesians produced a new cause of\r\ndistrust; for the nobles were suspected of having been very remiss in\r\ntheir resistance of the invaders. This brought to a head the suspicions\r\nwhich had originally been grounded on points of doctrinal difference;\r\nand the sterner members of the Utraquist clergy declared that they\r\nhad no adequate security for the genuineness of the conversion of the\r\nnobles. John of Z̆elív followed up this attack by demanding the removal\r\nof all the clergy who adhered to the old ritual, and who would not\r\nsing in Bohemian. The Town Councils consented to the change, and John\r\nsucceeded in thrusting into the vacant preacherships some supporters\r\neven of those doctrines which had been condemned by both sections of\r\nthe Utraquist party.\r\n\r\nBut the fear of foreign invasion was once more to drive into the\r\nbackground for a time the internal divisions of the Utraquist party.\r\nThe fiery energy of Martin V. had roused the electors of the Empire\r\nfrom the panic into which they had been thrown by the failure of the\r\nfirst crusade; and the Margrave of Meissen, the fiercest of the enemies\r\nof Bohemia, had begun a new invasion on his own responsibility.\r\nZ̆iz̆ka had been recently wounded in his only sound eye; but, at the\r\nrumour of the new attack, he at once hurried out to battle, and the\r\nmen of Meissen fled before him. The rumours of the divisions between\r\nthe nobles and the citizens had, however, encouraged the Meissener to\r\nrenew their attack; and a few successes on their part induced Frederick\r\nof Hohenzollern to organise a second crusade among the princes of the\r\nEmpire. The Bohemian peasants fled before the advance of the new army\r\nand took refuge in the town of Z̆atec. So in September, 1421, an army\r\nof two thousand Imperialists marched against Z̆atec, and the terrified\r\ncitizens began to despair of resistance.\r\n\r\nBut their anxieties and dangers came to an unexpected end. As the\r\nwatchers were gazing one day from the city walls on the camp of the\r\nenemy, their attention was caught by a sudden glow of fire. The flame\r\nrapidly spread through the camp, and all the tents of the enemy were\r\nconsumed. To the astonished eyes of the watchers it seemed as if a\r\nmiracle had been worked on their behalf; but the real explanation,\r\nthough wonderful enough, was not connected with those interferences\r\nwith the order of nature to which conventional phraseology has confined\r\nthe name of miracle. The fact was that the Electors of the German\r\nEmpire had heard that the terrible Z̆iz̆ka was approaching; and so the\r\ngreat army of the second crusade had burnt their tents and retreated\r\nwithout striking a blow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Z̆IZ̆KA ON HORSEBACK AT THE HEAD OF THE FLAIL-BEARING\r\nTABORITES.\r\n\r\n(_From an old picture copied in Dr. Toman’s pamphlet._)]\r\n\r\nSigismund had been absent in Hungary during this struggle, but he now\r\nadvanced at the head of a Hungarian army to Brünn (Brno), committing\r\nevery kind of barbarity on the way. It will be remembered that he had\r\nrecently announced that he had never objected to a discussion of the\r\nFour Articles. He now summoned all the Moravian nobles before him, and\r\nthreatened to put them to death unless they would abjure all those\r\nArticles. Apparently the nobles were not made of the same stuff as the\r\nsturdy preachers of Tabor and Prague; for, with two exceptions, all the\r\nUtraquist nobles of Moravia consented to abandon their creed and accept\r\nthat of Sigismund.\r\n\r\nDoubtless encouraged by this success, Sigismund marched to Kutna Hora\r\nat the head of an army of about eight thousand men. Z̆iz̆ka advanced\r\nto the relief of the town, and the townsmen themselves made a gallant\r\ndefence; but some traitor opened one of the gates to the Imperial\r\nsoldiers, and the massacre which followed on their entry made so deep\r\nan impression on the imagination of the Bohemians, that in later ages\r\nit was compared to the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Z̆iz̆ka’s forces\r\nwere now completely surrounded; and, on the 22nd of December, 1421,\r\nhe found himself at the mercy of his opponents in a bitter winter and\r\nwithout any possibility of obtaining food. Sigismund now thought his\r\nvictory secure; but he little knew with whom he had to deal. In spite\r\nof cold and hunger, Z̆iz̆ka kept his troops firm and patient till\r\nmidnight. Then, having observed the weakest point in the royal army, he\r\nmade a sudden and unexpected dash, broke through the Royalist lines,\r\nand was soon raising new forces and new provisions in the country. The\r\nHungarians now scattered themselves about, plundering and ravishing\r\nin the neighbouring villages, when, suddenly, in January, 1422, a\r\nparty of the plunderers were startled in an outlying village by the\r\nappearance of Z̆iz̆ka at the head of a new army. Sigismund was once\r\nmore panic-struck. He ordered the town of Kutna Hora to be set on fire;\r\nfastened the councillors to his carriage, and fled as fast as he could\r\ngo to the town of Deutschbrod (Nemecky Brod). Z̆iz̆ka, in spite of the\r\nhard frost, followed with all his horses and baggage-waggons; and he so\r\ncompletely routed Sigismund that twelve thousand of the Hungarian army\r\nwere killed, and the King never again entered Bohemia during Z̆iz̆ka’s\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, the divisions in Prague were reaching their\r\nheight. John the Priest (as John of Z̆elív was now called) had, on\r\nOctober 19th, struck a popular _coup d’état_. He had persuaded the\r\npeople to depose the nobles from office, and to choose one man as\r\ncaptain of the city, with four others for each division of the town.\r\nThe new Councillors, who were appointed under this arrangement,\r\nproceeded to summon to Prague a certain John Sadlo, who had been a\r\nzealous Utraquist, but who happened to have incurred the suspicion of\r\nthe new rulers of the town. He was promised a safe-conduct; but, on\r\narriving in Prague, he was seized and summarily executed. The moderate\r\nmen of Prague now felt that a stand must be made; and they called a\r\nmeeting at which Jakaubek of Kladrau and Peter Payne drew up certain\r\nArticles for the government of the clergy. Four directors were to be\r\nchosen to regulate the appointment to every church in Prague, and\r\nto prevent the introduction of novelties in ritual, unless publicly\r\njustified from Scripture. John was urged by his followers to resist\r\nthis proposal; but he seems to have felt it better to give way, and\r\nto accept the three colleagues, who were combined with him in the\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBut, however much such an arrangement might satisfy the champions\r\nof Utraquist orthodoxy, it could not restore the sense of order and\r\nstability which had been shaken by John’s overbearing proceedings,\r\nand especially by the murder of Sadlo. C̆enĕk of Wartenberg and other\r\nnobles again fled to Sigismund; and, although the citizens of Prague\r\nand the Masters of the University were far from being disposed to that\r\ncourse, they felt that the security to be obtained by the presence of\r\na King would be their best guarantee against the encroachments of the\r\nextreme party. The King of Poland had rejected the offer of the crown;\r\nbut the Duke of Lithuania seemed more ready to listen to the advances\r\nof the Bohemians. Apparently, however, his sympathies arose rather\r\nfrom a general Slavonic feeling, and a personal dislike of Sigismund,\r\nthan from any doctrinal sympathies with the Utraquists. He had been\r\na comparatively recent convert to Christianity; and he had all the\r\nconsequent zeal for orthodoxy. The Calixtines assured him that they\r\nhad no desire for separation from the Romish Church, and that they did\r\nnot admit the charge of heresy. In the hope, therefore, of defeating\r\nSigismund, and of bringing back the Bohemians to the Catholic Church,\r\nWitold of Lithuania consented that his nephew, Sigismund Korybut,\r\nshould be sent to represent him in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nPrince Korybut, however, insisted that, before he would enter Prague,\r\nPriest John should be deposed from his power. Those nobles who had\r\nremained faithful to the national cause were specially eager to carry\r\nout this understanding. They deposed all the Councillors both in the\r\nOld and New Town; and they arranged that each quarter should choose new\r\nCouncillors for a year, of whom none should be priests or Masters of\r\nArts. At the same time Has̆ek of Waldstein was chosen chief captain of\r\nthe town. But the terror which John had excited among the nobles and\r\nricher citizens could not be removed by these arrangements. So on March\r\n8th two councillors were sent to John, to ask him to come to the Town\r\nCouncil to consult with them. When he came, they asked his advice about\r\nthe plan of campaign, and seemed to listen respectfully. Then they went\r\non to urge him to make peace between the rival parties, before they\r\nwent to battle. John answered that, if they desired peace, they must\r\nnot take away houses from those to whom the Community had given them,\r\nnor must they depose faithful servants such as the late Captain of the\r\ntown. Then, whilst they were still speaking, the burgomaster gave a\r\nsign; and the soldiers rushed in and seized Priest John and several of\r\nhis friends, took them into an outer hall, and executed them. As soon\r\nas the people of the town heard the news, they rose in fury, broke into\r\nthe Council House, seized and beheaded the leading Councillors, and\r\ncompelled Has̆ek of Waldstein to fly for his life.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed as if the death of John had really deprived the extreme\r\nparty in Prague of their chances of final success; for, when in May,\r\n1422, Korybut arrived in Prague, he was able, with apparently little\r\ntrouble, to remove the Councillors of the extreme party, and to restore\r\nthe Calixtines.\r\n\r\nFor a time Korybut seemed to give new strength and coherence to the\r\nUtraquist movement; but his reign was not of long duration. Martin\r\nV. had been extremely alarmed at the sympathies shown in Poland and\r\nLithuania for the Utraquist cause; and by his orders the Polish clergy\r\npersuaded King Ladislaus to organise a new expedition against the\r\nUtraquists, while they induced Witold of Lithuania to recall Prince\r\nKorybut. But, though the summons for a third crusade was sent out to\r\nPoles, Lithuanians, Swedes, and Norwegians, yet the Pope soon found\r\nthat it was easier to cajole kings than to convert peoples. Not only\r\ndid the Poles and Ruthenians refuse to serve in the crusade; but, in\r\nspite of Ladislaus’s rebukes, they hastened to take up arms for the\r\nBohemians; and so the third crusade collapsed even more ignominiously\r\nthan the former ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD PICTURE OF Z̆IZ̆KA IN HEAVEN.\r\n\r\n(_From Dr. Toman’s pamphlet._)]\r\n\r\nThe fear of a foreign invasion being thus removed, the nobles resolved\r\non a final struggle for power with the Taborites. Z̆iz̆ka had\r\nreluctantly consented to recognise Korybut as king; but the recall\r\nof the latter broke this link between the nobles and the Taborite\r\nleader. He had resented the treacherous murder of John of Z̆elív; and\r\nhe had special causes of his own for distrusting the leading nobles.\r\nHe himself belonged to that Order of Knights, or gentry, which was\r\nin continual rivalry with the greater nobility; while his intense\r\nreligious zeal, and his scorn of caste, had drawn him close to the\r\nfiery peasants of Mount Tabor, and increased his contempt for the\r\nvacillations and treacheries of C̆enek of Wartenberg and Ulric of\r\nRosenberg. The struggle which now followed was a fierce and bloody one;\r\nbut it ended in the complete victory of Z̆iz̆ka, and the consent of the\r\nnobles to return to the popular cause. They were the more willing to\r\ncome to terms as the King had just mortally offended Bohemian feeling\r\nby granting the province of Moravia to Albert, Duke of Austria, and had\r\nrecognised him as his heir in Bohemia. Korybut had now escaped from his\r\nuncle and returned to Bohemia; and, though he was no longer recognised\r\nas their legal ruler, he was welcomed as an ally and a captain in their\r\nwars, and he marched with the united Utraquist army into Moravia, to\r\ndeliver it from Albert of Austria. Z̆iz̆ka, though now completely\r\nblind, also led his forces into Moravia.\r\n\r\nBut in October, 1424, he was seized with a sudden illness and died. His\r\ndeath naturally created a great sensation; and it is a proof of the\r\nsubstantial success of his work that the changes which were expected\r\nto take place, in consequence of his death, were much greater than\r\nany that actually occurred. A section, indeed, of his more immediate\r\npersonal followers did form themselves into a separate party under\r\nthe name of the “Orphans”; but though, like Z̆iz̆ka, they were more\r\nmoderate in their doctrines than the rest of the Taborites, they\r\ncontinued, for all practical purposes, to act with the latter; nor did\r\nSigismund find that the terror, which the name of Hussite had inspired,\r\nhad at all diminished. A married priest named Procop rapidly rose to\r\nthe position which Z̆iz̆ka had held; and so far was he from slackening\r\nthe zeal of his followers that he soon introduced a more aggressive\r\nelement into the warfare. Tired of remaining so long on the defensive,\r\nhe resolved that the Germans and Hungarians should feel something of\r\nthe misery which they had inflicted on Bohemia; and he began a series\r\nof invasions of Austria, Bavaria, and Hungary, which considerably added\r\nto the terrors which had been produced by Z̆iz̆ka.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, the changes in the Calixtine party became more\r\nnoticeable at this time than among those who seemed more likely to\r\nbe affected by Z̆iz̆ka’s death. Jakaubek fell at this time into the\r\nbackground, and John Pr̆zibram came more to the front. Pr̆zibram was\r\none of those bitter theologians who delight to dwell on the negative\r\nside of their doctrines, rather than on those that tend to unity and\r\npositive faith. He had been willing enough to maintain the cause of\r\nthe Four Articles of Prague against the Catholic priests; but, now\r\nthat the Catholic cause seemed lost in Prague, he began to express so\r\noffensively and insultingly his opposition to the Taborites, that he\r\ndisgusted the more moderate men of his own party; and on Christmas Day,\r\n1426, he demanded, in a further discussion, that the Hussites should\r\nspecially condemn the doctrines of Wyclif.\r\n\r\nThis proposal produced a definite change in the position of Peter\r\nPayne. Although his doctrinal convictions were probably well known,\r\nyet, in the interests of peace and order, he had hitherto been willing\r\nto co-operate with the Calixtines in checking the excesses of the\r\nTaborites. But the attack on his distinguished countryman, to whose\r\nwritings he probably looked for guidance more than to those of Hus,\r\nwas too much for his personal and patriotic sympathies, and he eagerly\r\ntook up the cause of Wyclif. The decision of the meeting, however,\r\nwas against the English reformer; and Korybut, who shared his uncle’s\r\ndislike to the heretical position into which the Hussites had been\r\nforced, seized upon this resolution as a sign of their desire to\r\nreturn to union with the Church. So he sent messengers to Pope Martin\r\nto assure him that this decision represented the real feeling of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut this unfortunate step, instead of producing reunion with Rome,\r\nonly called out new divisions in the Utraquist party. John Rokycana,\r\nthe preacher at the Teyn Church, heard of these negotiations; and,\r\nthough a strict and zealous Calixtine, he was a warm patriot, and by\r\nno means disposed to put either his faith or his nation at the feet\r\nof either Emperor or Pope. So in April, 1427, he preached an alarmist\r\nsermon warning the people that their interests were being betrayed.\r\nThe people sprang to arms; Korybut was imprisoned; and Pr̆zibram and\r\nseveral of his allies were banished from Prague. But, to prove that\r\nthe movement had a national rather than a doctrinal purpose, Rokycana\r\nand his friends passed a resolution in favour of at least a modified\r\nform of Transubstantiation. Thus Peter Payne was compelled to take his\r\npart with the Taborites, while a new division was formed among the\r\nCalixtines themselves.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime the aggressive policy of Procop had roused Martin\r\nV. to new energy; and since Germans, Hungarians, and Poles had each in\r\nturn failed him, he entrusted the management of a fourth crusade to\r\nan Englishman. This was the celebrated Cardinal Beaufort, who was now\r\nappointed legate for Bohemia, Hungary, and Germany, and under whose\r\nauspices a special Hussite tax was raised throughout the Empire. The\r\nMargrave of Brandenburg and the Archbishop of Trier took the leading\r\npart in the command of the army; and in July, 1427, the new crusaders\r\nentered Bohemia and began the siege of Kladrau. While they were almost\r\nhoping to capture the town, Procop suddenly advanced against them at\r\nthe head of the united Utraquist army. Immediately the strange panic,\r\nwhich had become traditional at the approach of the Utraquists, seized\r\nupon the enemy; and they fled to the town of Tachov, which was at that\r\ntime in their hands. Here Beaufort met them, reproached them with their\r\ncowardice, and persuaded them to prepare for battle. But no sooner did\r\nProcop’s army again appear in sight than the panic once more returned.\r\nBeaufort, enraged, seized the banner of the Empire and tore it to\r\npieces in their presence. But the sense of fear was too strong, even\r\nfor soldierly dignity; and at last the indignant Cardinal was swept\r\naway in the flight. Several new victories followed, though Pilsen\r\n(Plz̆en) still held out against the Utraquist armies. Beaufort demanded\r\nthat a new anti-Hussite tax should be raised, and at the same time sent\r\na command to the men of Pilsen that they should abstain from a proposed\r\ndiscussion with the Hussites on points of doctrine. The discussion\r\ntook place notwithstanding; and Rokycana and Peter Payne were appointed\r\nto represent the Utraquist party.\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal might have spared his fears; for the result of the\r\ndiscussion was to widen the gulf, not between the Catholics and the\r\nUtraquists, but between the Calixtines and the Taborites. This led\r\nto other discussions between the two Utraquist parties, of so fierce\r\na kind that it seemed as if their enemies might almost succeed in\r\nprofiting by their divisions. But those enemies were now becoming\r\nthoroughly exhausted. The raids of Procop had brought home to Germans\r\nand Hungarians the danger of provoking the Bohemians too far; while\r\namong many of the German citizens the question was beginning to be\r\nasked, whether a cause which enabled untrained peasants to strike\r\nterror into the best armies of Europe was not perhaps the cause of\r\nGod. Under these circumstances the cry for a Church Council to settle\r\nthese matters by discussion, rather than by force of arms, was becoming\r\ngeneral, and, much as the Pope loathed such an idea, he found the\r\nground cut from under his feet by the desertion of his most sturdy\r\nsupporter. The war between France and England had suddenly received\r\na new turn by the appearance of Joan of Arc; and Cardinal Beaufort’s\r\nanxiety for the success of his country decided him on the desperate\r\nstep of employing the money and men whom he had raised to fight against\r\nBohemia in the war against France. Alarmed as the Pope and his friends\r\nwere at this sudden desertion, they hoped for a time that the wonderful\r\nMaid might herself take up their cause against the heretics. But\r\nwhen this hope was cut short by her defeat and imprisonment, the cry\r\nfor a Council became again strong, and Martin was even told that, if\r\nhe sincerely desired to put down the Hussites, he would prove it by\r\ngranting the discussion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHODI BOHEMIAN PEASANTS OF THE BAVARIAN BORDER.]\r\n\r\nThe fiery Pope, however, was determined to make one last appeal to\r\narms; and this time he chose an Italian cardinal, Giuliano Cesarini,\r\nto organise a crusade. Before the crusade could start, Martin V.\r\ndied; but Cesarini was as determined as the Pope had been on leading\r\nthe expedition to its triumph. The Margrave of Brandenburg was again\r\nappointed commander, though the suspicions which his previous flight\r\nhad caused were so great, that the Cardinal and the Electors insisted\r\non checking his power by a Council of Nine. Sigismund declared his\r\napproval of the crusade, and then wrote to Prague to assure the\r\ncitizens of his desire for peace.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Procop had rallied his forces and advanced to the\r\nborders of Bavaria; but they waited so long for the enemy that their\r\nfood began to fail, and some of the troops dropped off to forage for\r\nsupplies. The Germans, encouraged by this laxity, once more advanced to\r\nthe town of Tachov. The Cardinal desired them to storm the town; but\r\nthe generals decided to delay the attack; and the townsmen succeeded\r\nin so well fortifying the town that the German army abandoned the\r\nsiege, and finally retreated to Taus (Domaz̆lic̆e). In the meantime\r\nthe Bohemians had collected their forces, and on Aug. 14, 1431,\r\nthey advanced towards Domaz̆lic̆e, singing one of their favourite\r\nhymns, “Kdoz̆ jste Boz̆i bojovnici”--“Ye who are the soldiers of the\r\nLord.” The Cardinal went up the hill to consult the Duke of Saxony\r\nabout the arrangements of the battle, when suddenly he observed a\r\nstrange confusion, and heard loud cries in the camp of the Margrave\r\nof Brandenburg. Soon after, Frederick himself came hastily to him, to\r\ntell him that his army was in full flight and could not be checked.\r\nThe panic quickly spread; and this time it was so complete, that even\r\nthe waggons and firearms were left behind; while among the spoil the\r\nBohemians had the satisfaction of finding, not only the coat and\r\ncrucifix of Cardinal Cesarini, but even the Papal Bull sanctioning the\r\ncrusade against Bohemia. So ended the fifth and last attempt to crush\r\nout the Hussite heresy by force; and it was now to be tried whether\r\nthe Doctors of the Church could succeed in convincing the heretics who\r\ncould not be conquered by the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nFROM THE OPENING OF THE COUNCIL OF BASEL TO THE FALL OF TABOR.\r\n\r\n(1437-1452.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Council of Basel seemed to many to be the natural result of the\r\nCouncil of Constance. The conception of a constitutional check on\r\nthe power of the Popes, and of a better provision for the orderly\r\ngovernment of the Church, was an idea which had become familiar to\r\nthe leading theologians of Europe during the bitter ecclesiastical\r\ndivisions of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. And it must be\r\nremembered that, however unsatisfactory the results of the Council of\r\nConstance may seem to us, the dignity of its members and the apparent\r\nvigour of its action left a very different impression on the minds of\r\nmany of its contemporaries. It had succeeded in deposing and electing\r\nPopes; it had burnt the heretics whom it had condemned; it had found\r\nprinces ready to enforce its decrees by fire and sword. And if that\r\nlast exercise of its power had ended in failure and disgrace, it might\r\nbe plausibly urged that the greater part of the war which it had\r\ninitiated had been carried on after the dissolution of the Council\r\nitself; and it was held therefore by many that the summoning of a\r\nsimilar Council would revive an influence in Europe more capable than\r\nthe Pope’s of crushing out heresy and restoring power to the Church.\r\nIt was just this consciousness of the popular expectation from the new\r\nCouncil which strengthened the opposition of Martin V. to the demand\r\nfor its convocation. He may, no doubt, have honestly believed that his\r\npersonal initiative was more likely to produce the desired effect on\r\nthe crusaders than the necessarily divided counsels of a large body of\r\nprinces and clergy. But at the same time he was very anxious that the\r\nexperiment should not be tried of setting up so dangerous a rival to\r\nthe Papal authority.\r\n\r\nFor the time, however, the feeling of the orthodox world seemed, with\r\nfew exceptions, to be overwhelmingly opposed to his; and, even before\r\nhis death, the Council of Basel had already begun its deliberations.\r\nBut, from an early stage in the preparations for the Council, a very\r\ndifferent conception had been put forward of the purposes for which\r\nit might be used. The Utraquists had from the first maintained that\r\nthey had not had a fair hearing before the Council of Constance; and\r\ntheir early victories had roused a hope that some less partial tribunal\r\nmight give them that opportunity of discussion of which they had been\r\ndefrauded. In the dispute after the battle of the Z̆iz̆ka Hill, they\r\nhad had a taste of those delights of argument for which they hungered;\r\nand the later victories of Z̆iz̆ka had induced Ulric of Rosenberg to\r\ndemand, and Sigismund to promise, that even the Taborites should have\r\ntheir share in such a discussion.\r\n\r\nIn 1427 even Frederick of Brandenburg and Cardinal Beaufort had\r\nactually prepared the way for a meeting which was to afford\r\nopportunities for doctrinal discussion; and, though Pope Martin was\r\nable at that time to prohibit the proposed conference, the Utraquists\r\ndid not lose sight of the prospect then held out to them. But, though\r\nthis conception of the more pacific purpose to which a Council might be\r\nturned, naturally induced the Utraquists to listen with some interest\r\nand hope to the arrangements for the meeting at Basel, that hope was\r\nstrongly mixed with fear and suspicion. To them, at least, the memories\r\nof Constance brought nothing but bitterness and loathing; and the\r\nevident hostility of those who were calling for the Council, led them\r\nto doubt whether their experiences of Basel would be likely to be any\r\nmore satisfactory than the unforgotten wrongs of Constance. But, above\r\nall other causes of discontent, was their ever-deepening distrust of\r\nthe promises of Sigismund; and at no time had that distrust been more\r\nfully justified.\r\n\r\nNew promises for a fair hearing were despatched by him almost\r\nsimultaneously with preparations for a new war; and concessions of\r\nthe most hopeful kind were continually explained away. Even the great\r\noverthrow of the last crusade did not bring to an end the fierce desire\r\nof Sigismund to re-establish his power by force of arms; and the Duke\r\nof Bavaria and the Count Palatine of the Rhine were eager to second\r\nhis efforts in a cause which most men now recognised as hopeless.\r\n\r\nBut the growing desire for peace was now increased by a terrible fear.\r\nThe rulers of Europe remembered that desire to throw off the power\r\nof their predecessors, which had shown itself among the peasantry of\r\nEurope after the failure of the crusades in the thirteenth century;\r\nand which had been renewed after the overthrow of the French nobles\r\nby the English invaders of the fourteenth. This same feeling was now\r\nagain apparent; and this time the hopes which accompanied it were\r\nevidently based on more reasonable grounds. That the Saracen generals\r\nshould defeat the armies of Louis IX., or that the English nobles\r\nshould overthrow the French at Crecy and Poictiers, might be convincing\r\narguments of the weakness of the defeated parties; but they did not\r\nnecessarily prove that those who yielded to such opponents, would\r\nsuccumb to the attacks of an untrained peasantry. Now, however, for\r\ntwelve years past, the peasantry of Bohemia, armed mainly with their\r\nthrashing flails, had repeatedly put to flight the greatest armies of\r\nEurope, and overawed their own nobility. Surely such an example might\r\ngive to the peasants of Germany and France some hope that a time was\r\ncoming in which they too might be the equals of their oppressors!\r\nIn the South of France the French peasantry rose in large numbers,\r\ndemanding that the nobles should, for the future, be content to earn\r\ntheir bread by the sweat of their brow, and declaring that two priests\r\nwere all that were required for the spiritual needs of the country. In\r\nDauphiné collections were made on behalf of the Bohemians; while in the\r\nRhine district three thousand peasants near Bonn and Speier declared\r\ntheir determination to overthrow the power of the clergy and nobles.\r\nUnder these circumstances, there was a general cry that, if the Council\r\ndid not come to terms with the Hussites, the peasant insurrection would\r\nspread throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nNor, on the other hand, were there wanting strong reasons why the\r\nBohemians, on their side, should be eager for a peaceable settlement.\r\nOn them had fallen the main misery of the war; and it is a curious fact\r\nthat, in spite of their brilliant successes on the battlefield, much\r\nof their country was still in the hands of the enemy. Not only was the\r\ngreater part of Moravia held down by Albert of Austria, but, in Bohemia\r\nitself, the strong fortress of Carlstein, and the important towns of\r\nBudweis (Budejóvice), Pilsen (Plz̆en), and Eger (Cheb), still held out\r\nagainst the Utraquists. Moreover, the discontent with the power which\r\nProcop had gained by his victories, was working among the more moderate\r\nsection of the Utraquists in favour of a settlement in which learned\r\nmen should have more power than soldiers.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, an understanding was at last brought about;\r\nand, in January, 1433, the representatives of the Bohemians arrived in\r\nBasel. There seem to have been some five, or possibly six, Utraquists\r\nwho had been chosen to represent their party; but the burden of the\r\ndiscussion, at any rate, fell upon four people, who were each entrusted\r\nwith the defence of one of the Articles of Prague. The most important\r\nof these champions, and the one who was to gain most credit by the\r\ndiscussion, was, beyond all question, John Rokycana. He had been\r\nsteadily advancing in reputation, both as a learned disputant and as a\r\nmoderate and judicious leader. The teacher from whom he had derived his\r\nstrongest convictions was Jakaubek of Kladrau; and he had, as it were,\r\ninherited from him a special devotion to the practice of Communion in\r\nboth kinds. Rokycana, like Hus, had had great struggles with poverty\r\nin acquiring his early education; and, though his doctrines naturally\r\nconnected him with the Calixtine section of the Utraquists, his obscure\r\norigin, combined with his strong will and individuality of character,\r\noften brought him out of sympathy with the aristocratic patrons of the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ROKYCANA.]\r\n\r\nHis first public action had been an attempt to make terms between the\r\ncitizens of Prague and Z̆iz̆ka, in the last year of Z̆iz̆ka’s struggle\r\nwith the nobles, and he induced the latter to abandon an attack upon\r\nthe city. His next prominent appearance had been of a less pacific\r\nkind; for it was connected with his vehement opposition to the attempt\r\nof Prince Korybut to make terms with Sigismund. Though, however, on\r\nthat occasion, Rokycana had been the chief promoter of the arrest of\r\nKorybut, Pr̆zibram, and other champions of compromise; yet he had\r\nsteadily exerted himself to prevent bloodshed in the collision between\r\nthe two parties; and he had afterwards encouraged arrangements for the\r\nbringing back of the Calixtine priests who had been expelled during the\r\nstruggles. Since the death of Jakaubek, Rokycana seems to have divided\r\nthe leadership of the Utraquist clergy of Prague with the Englishman,\r\nPeter Payne.\r\n\r\nPayne, as has been already pointed out, belonged, in doctrine, to\r\nthe extremer section of the Utraquists; but by his moderate policy\r\nhe had often been drawn into sympathy with the Calixtines. Since the\r\ndeath of Z̆iz̆ka, he seems to have been frequently identified with\r\nthat party of Orphans who claimed to represent, more exactly than the\r\nother Taborites, the policy of their leader. This choice of colleagues\r\ncontributed still further to distinguish Payne from the main body of\r\nthose who agreed with his doctrines; and lastly, the peculiarity of his\r\nposition was increased by that reputation for learning which was always\r\nan object of suspicion to the peasant soldiers of Tabor.\r\n\r\nThe other two Utraquist delegates at the Council of Basel were entirely\r\nrepresentative of the Taborite party. One was Nicholaus of Pilgram\r\n(Pelhr̆imov), the “Bishop,” as he was called, of the Taborites; and\r\nthe other was Procop the Great, the successor of Z̆iz̆ka on the\r\nbattlefield. Procop, though less cruel than Z̆iz̆ka, had a more\r\nexclusive faith in physical force; and he was less interested in\r\nquestions of statesmanship, or details of doctrine; but, as the most\r\nsuccessful general in the religious wars, he could not be passed over\r\nin the election of representatives.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1433, the Bohemian delegates entered Basel, accompanied\r\nby a troop of three hundred horsemen. A great crowd came out to\r\nmeet them; and the windows were full of people of all ages and both\r\nsexes, who gazed with astonishment on the strange dresses of their\r\nvisitors; while those who were determined to assist their eyes by their\r\nimagination, discovered that these terrible heretics had repulsive\r\nfaces and cruel eyes. To most of the spectators the chief object of\r\ninterest was the famous general, Procop; and all strained their eyes to\r\nget a glimpse of the man whose very name had become so great a terror\r\nto the armies of the Empire.\r\n\r\nForemost among those who hastened to welcome the strangers was Cardinal\r\nJulian Cesarini; and it must be owned that few men ever had a more\r\ndifficult part to play, or played it with more consummate tact and\r\nsuccess. It required some courage to claim the position of impartial\r\narbitrator, where one of the parties to the cause was a body of men\r\nagainst whom he had recently proclaimed a destructive crusade; nor\r\ncould it be altogether gratifying to him to face in discussion men\r\nwho had won their right to a hearing by putting him to an ignominious\r\nflight. Added to these considerations, was the further difficulty that,\r\nwhile he heartily desired the success of the Council, he took part in\r\nits proceedings as the representative of a Pope who had denounced it,\r\nand who wished to dissolve it. But the Cardinal was unusually well\r\nsupplied with that graceful tact and ready wit which so distinguishes\r\nhis countrymen. He resigned the formal presidency of the Council in\r\ndeference to the Pope’s opposition; yet he not only remained in the\r\ncity, but even managed by timely interventions to gain as much control\r\nover the proceedings of the Council as if he were still its official\r\nchief. With regard to the Bohemian delegates, he evidently set before\r\nhimself, from the first, two objects, both of which he, in some\r\nmeasure, accomplished. He was determined that the Council should pass\r\noff peaceably, and that the Bohemians should have no cause to complain\r\nthat they had failed to obtain a fair hearing; but he was equally\r\nresolved that, if concessions should be made to the heretics, those\r\nconcessions should be, indirectly, a means of weakening the Utraquist\r\ncause. With the keen eye of a diplomatist, he at once noted the points\r\nof division between his opponents, and the best means of making use of\r\nthem. Friendly as was his bearing towards all the representatives of\r\nthe Bohemians, the one whom he singled out for peculiar attention and\r\nflattery was Procop; and the determination which he showed to bring\r\nhim and his friends to the front betrays a purpose which it is not\r\ndifficult to understand.\r\n\r\nOn January 10, 1433, the Council gathered in the Dominican cloister at\r\nBasel, to receive their new guests. To most of the orthodox Councillors\r\nit must have seemed a most humiliating moment when those, whom they\r\nhad hoped to exterminate as heretics, were admitted to argue on equal\r\nterms, in defence of the orthodoxy of their doctrines. But Cesarini was\r\nequal to the occasion; he welcomed the Bohemians as at last returning\r\nto the bosom of their mother Church; and, while promising them a fair\r\nhearing, managed to emphasise the principle that the authority of\r\nCouncils and of Fathers of the Church must be accepted as guides in the\r\nsettlement of points of faith.\r\n\r\nRokycana answered by admitting that the Councils and Fathers would have\r\ntheir due weight with his friends; but he maintained, at the same time,\r\nthat the Council of Constance had condemned their doctrines without\r\na hearing. On their part, they were prepared to confirm all their\r\ndoctrines by reference to the Gospels and the other sacred writings;\r\nthey came to prove their innocence in the presence of the whole Church;\r\nand they asked that they should have a fair hearing before laymen as\r\nwell as clergymen. The Utraquists were then asked what points they\r\nwished to discuss in which they differed from the practice of the\r\nRomish Church. They answered by enumerating the Four Prague Articles.\r\n\r\nCesarini now saw his opportunity, and he at once asked the Utraquist\r\nrepresentatives if there were not other doctrines which had been\r\nspecially put forth by them; for instance, he had heard it said\r\nthat they believed the Mendicant Orders to have been founded by the\r\ndevil. Procop immediately sprang up, and exclaimed that that was\r\nperfectly true; for, since these Orders were not founded by Moses,\r\nthe Patriarchs, or the Prophets, nor yet by Christ, they must have\r\nbeen founded by the devil. This extraordinary argument was naturally\r\nreceived with laughter in the Council; but Cesarini insisted on\r\ntreating it as serious, and met it by an elaborate refutation.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of January, Rokycana opened his speech in defence of the\r\ngranting of the Cup to the laity. While grounding his argument largely\r\non the custom of the primitive Church, he yet fortified it by reference\r\nto decisions of Councils; and he asked whether any Council, before\r\nthat of Constance, had ever condemned the practice as heretical.\r\n\r\nHis speech produced a deep impression, even on his opponents; but the\r\neffect was somewhat weakened when, a few days later, Nicholaus, the\r\nBishop of Pilgram (Pelhr̆imov), opened the discussion on the second\r\nPrague Article, namely, the punishment by the Church of offences\r\nagainst morality. He quickly passed into attacks on the priesthood for\r\nthe neglect of their duties, and became so fierce that he caused a\r\ndisturbance in the Assembly; so that Rokycana afterwards rebuked his\r\ncolleague for his intemperate language.\r\n\r\nA less prominent delegate, Oldr̆ich of Znojem, was entrusted with the\r\ndefence of the doctrine of the free preaching of the Word; and the\r\nFourth Article, on the civil dominion of the clergy, was treated by\r\nPeter Payne. Payne had always impressed his opponents with the subtlety\r\nof his arguments; but he must somewhat have embarrassed his colleagues\r\nby a defence of the doctrines of Wyclif; and, particularly by that\r\nclaim of the English Reformer that the temporal lords might, in some\r\ncircumstances, take away the property of the clergy. It was, however,\r\namong his own countrymen that Payne’s appearance excited the most\r\nirritation; and several of them sprang up to attack him, not only as\r\na condemned heretic, but as a traitor to King Henry VI. The hubbub at\r\nlast became so great that he was forced to end his argument by handing\r\nin a written paper. Then followed the champions of orthodoxy; and very\r\nbitter was the feeling provoked by the attacks of John of Ragusa\r\nupon the Bohemian nation, as a whole. Cesarini exerted himself to\r\nrestore order; but he again insisted that the Bohemians should express\r\ntheir opinions, not only on the Four Articles of Prague, but on the\r\nTwenty-four Articles of the Taborites, which involved a modified denial\r\nof Transubstantiation, and the rejection of many doctrines and rites\r\naccepted by the main body of the Utraquists.\r\n\r\nThe division of opinion, called out by this demand of the Cardinal,\r\ntended to weaken the order and decorum of the proceedings, and yet\r\nfurther increased the disturbance; and the orthodox critics of the\r\ndebates began to demand how it was that the Council had failed as yet\r\nto convert the heretics, and to suggest that it would be better to\r\nresort to the former method of the sword. The delegates themselves\r\ngradually grew tired of the discussion, and desired to return to\r\nBohemia. Even those Councillors who were most anxious for the success\r\nof the Council felt that the bitterness, which had arisen, prevented\r\nthe hope of any useful conclusion in Basel; so, by way of compromise,\r\nit was at last decided that Rokycana and his colleagues should return\r\nto Prague; but that delegates from the Council should be sent to\r\ncontinue the conference in that city. Thus ended the first stage of the\r\ndiscussion; and, while Rokycana returned to influence affairs in the\r\ncapital, Procop hastened back to renew the often-attempted siege of\r\nPilsen.\r\n\r\nIt now became clear that the divisions, which had been so carefully\r\nfostered between the Calixtines and the Taborites, were ready to break\r\nout into a dangerous flame. On the one hand, Meinhard of Neuhaus, one\r\nof the few nobles who had remained partially faithful to the Utraquist\r\ncause, called together a meeting of his supporters, and urged them to\r\nshake off the yoke of Procop, and to choose a captain from the ranks\r\nof the poorer nobility, who should carry on the government with the\r\nhelp of a Council. On the other hand, Lupus, a priest of the Taborites,\r\nstirred up the inhabitants of the New Town against Rokycana and his\r\nfriends, and exhorted them to refuse submission to the newly-elected\r\nCaptain. Nor did the arrival of the ambassadors from Basel tend to\r\nlessen this bitterness; for though they held out hopes of concessions\r\nto the Calixtines, they fanned the flame of division between them and\r\nthe Taborites; and, about the time of their return to Basel, friendly\r\nmessengers came to Pilsen to urge the Catholics to stand firm, as their\r\nvictory was approaching.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so successfully had the work of division been done, that the\r\nambassadors had found the means of discrediting Rokycana himself with\r\nmany of the Calixtines, and of bringing to the front the old party of\r\nPr̆zibram, which had been out of favour ever since the time of Prince\r\nKorybut. The wedge which they used to make this split was sufficiently\r\ningenious. They proposed that the Communion in both kinds should be\r\nallowed to those who wished it; but that the Communion in one kind\r\nshould be left, in those churches where it was preferred. To modern\r\nthinkers, no doubt, such a compromise would seem the ideal settlement;\r\nbut to those who had been struggling, for so many years, against the\r\ninvaders who were trying to crush out these practices, it seemed as\r\nif such a concession would only sow the seeds of fresh bitterness.\r\nSuch a compromise, said Rokycana, Wenceslaus IV. had attempted; and\r\nthe attempt had ended in a bitter fight, in which one party had\r\nexpelled the other. There was much force in Rokycana’s arguments; but\r\nit was easy to represent him as an opponent of reasonable liberty,\r\nand (a charge which was more telling at that moment) as a hinderer of\r\npeaceable union.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, the siege of Pilsen was making such progress that\r\nthe Catholics and moderate Utraquists began to fear that the victory,\r\nwhich seemed almost within their grasp, might be taken from them after\r\nall; and Sigismund wrote to Ulric of Rosenberg that the Taborites were\r\nactually preparing to send a special embassy of their own to Basel;\r\nand that, unless the Calixtines would go to Pilsen, to hinder the\r\nprogress of Procop, the Council of Basel would after all be compelled\r\nto make concessions to the extreme party. While things were in this\r\nstate, Procop suddenly received news in his camp that the bitterness\r\nbetween the two parties in Prague had at last led to a final outbreak.\r\nThe Taborites of the New Town had resolved to resist the authority\r\nof the newly elected Captain, and had fortified their division of\r\nPrague against him; whereupon Meinhard of Neuhaus had suddenly stormed\r\nthe New Town and put the Taborites to the sword. Thereupon Procop at\r\nonce resolved to abandon the siege of Pilsen, and to call on all the\r\nTaborites to follow him to Prague. Meinhard rallied his forces for the\r\ndefence; and the two armies met on the 30th of May, 1434, near the town\r\nof Lipaný.\r\n\r\nThe Taborites followed the plan, so often adopted by Z̆iz̆ka, of\r\nfortifying their camp by an arrangement of their baggage waggons. From\r\nbehind these they threw shells into the camp of the enemy, which so\r\nirritated the soldiers that they called on the nobles to lead them to\r\nthe attack. The nobles, however, were resolved to accomplish their\r\npurposes by stratagem. The inferior troops were placed in the front,\r\nwith orders to give way at the first attack. The Taborites fell into\r\nthat trap; and, seeing the enemy, as they supposed, flying before them,\r\nthey left their entrenchments and pursued them. The picked troops of\r\nthe nobles then rushed forward, seized on the deserted waggons, and\r\nattacked the Taborites in the rear. The supposed fugitives, at the same\r\ntime, turned upon their pursuers; the Taborite army, surrounded on\r\nall sides, was cut to pieces; and Procop and the other leaders died,\r\nfighting to the last.\r\n\r\nThe immediate results of the battle of Lipaný were of two kinds. One of\r\nthe chief objects of Meinhard of Neuhaus and his friends had been to\r\npave the way for negotiations with Sigismund, and this object they at\r\nonce obtained; but the conduct of the negotiations was not altogether\r\nleft to those who had been the chief promoters of division. The death\r\nof Procop and of his immediate followers had given an opportunity to\r\nthe more moderate party of the Orphans to come to the front; and, as\r\nC̆apek, the leading general of the Orphans, was now the most prominent\r\nmilitary leader among the advanced section of the Utraquists, the\r\nchange naturally led to a removal of many of the differences which had\r\nso weakened the common cause. C̆apek carried on the policy of Z̆iz̆ka\r\nin the matter of maintaining an alliance with those of the Calixtines\r\nwho were sincerely zealous for their country and their faith.\r\n\r\nThe man who most embodied that cause, in the eyes of the general body\r\nof Bohemian patriots, was undoubtedly Rokycana; and thus he found\r\nthat his position had been greatly strengthened, for the time, by\r\nthe apparent victory of his opponents. While, therefore, the leaders\r\nof the Assembly were able to organise a deputation to Sigismund,\r\nof which Meinhard of Neuhaus was the chief leader, the terms which\r\nthe deputation offered were considerably coloured by the feeling of\r\nRokycana and his friends; for, on the one hand, they decided to insist\r\non many doctrines and rites which were condemned by the Taborites;\r\nand on the other hand, they demanded a strict enforcement of the Four\r\nArticles. They even proposed that no one should be received into the\r\ncity who did not communicate in both kinds; that the king should admit\r\nno one into his Councils who did not observe the same rule; and that,\r\nif any community was oppressed by the Emperor or his officials on\r\naccount of Utraquism, they should have the right of meeting force by\r\nforce. It was impossible to suppose that Sigismund would accept terms\r\nof this kind, in so crude a form; but his growing eagerness to recover\r\nhis crown made him extremely willing to enter into the discussion.\r\n\r\nHe would, indeed, have been glad to base his claim on grounds\r\nindependent of the religious controversy; and he even ventured to\r\nappeal to the Bohemians to accept him out of respect to his father’s\r\nmemory, and to remember that his grandmother was a Bohemian princess,\r\ndescended from the old ploughman king, Pr̆emysl. At the same time he\r\nremonstrated so sharply with the delegates of Basel on the slowness\r\nof their proceedings, and the quibbling of their arguments, that they\r\nbegan to fear that he would drift away into complete opposition to\r\nthe Council. They, therefore, urged on both parties the acceptance of\r\nan understanding which had been already put into shape in Basel. This\r\ncompromise involved the acceptance of the Four Articles, under certain\r\nconditions; the most important of which were that the Communion in\r\nboth kinds should only be allowed to those who admitted the complete\r\npresence of Christ in the Sacrament; and that, with regard to the\r\npunishment of public sins, the clergy should only be permitted to deal\r\nwith the offences of their own Order.\r\n\r\nBut Rokycana complained that these and other modifications required\r\nfurther explanation; and, on the other hand, the Basel delegates were\r\nalarmed at a proposal put forward by their opponents that no Bohemian\r\nshould be summoned before any foreign tribunal, whether secular or\r\nspiritual.\r\n\r\nAll difficulties, however, gave way before Sigismund’s inexhaustible\r\npower of lying; for, when the delegates found that his promises and\r\nconcessions had no real meaning, they began to calculate that, if he\r\nwere restored, he must rely mainly on the Catholics and the Pr̆zibram\r\nparty, and therefore would find his interest in breaking his word to\r\nthe Utraquists, and maintaining it towards the Catholics. But, perhaps,\r\nneither Sigismund nor the delegates of Basel were quite prepared for\r\nthe result of one concession which the King was induced to make. The\r\nArchbishop and two suffragan bishops were, according to the proposals\r\nof the Assembly, to be elected by representatives of all classes. A\r\nCouncil of Sixteen was chosen for this purpose; and they secretly\r\nfixed upon Rokycana as Archbishop of Prague. As soon as this election\r\nbecame known, the Emperor and the representatives of Basel were deeply\r\noffended at their choice; but Sigismund, as usual, succeeded in\r\nevading a direct reply; and, in their zeal for union, the Bohemians\r\nconsented, for a moment, to overlook this evasion. So on the 14th of\r\nAugust, 1436, Sigismund was once again formally accepted as king by the\r\nrepresentatives of all classes, the three towns of Königgrätz (Sadova),\r\nMies (Kladrau), and Kolin alone refusing to admit his claim.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that the King’s acceptance of the Compacts of\r\nBasel, and of all the limitations of his power, had been nominal.\r\nHe speedily dismissed from office the most zealous Calixtines, and\r\nencouraged the growth of Catholic ritual. With regard to Rokycana,\r\nthe King again found a means of evading any direct action. Philibert,\r\nBishop of Coutances, had come to Prague as one of the representatives\r\nof the Council of Basel; and, in consideration of his rank and\r\nposition, he was allowed to perform the duties which should have been\r\nentrusted to the Archbishop of Prague. At the same time the King made\r\na formal appeal to the Council of Basel to confirm Rokycana’s election;\r\nbut he advised them secretly to find excuses for delay in answering\r\nthis appeal.\r\n\r\nRokycana was not the man to conciliate a prince like Sigismund. He\r\nobserved with alarm the disreputable courtiers who had gathered round\r\nthe King; and he soon began to denounce the gambling, profligacy, and\r\ndrunkenness which were beginning to reappear in the city. It will be\r\nremembered that Rokycana had, from the first, prophesied an evil result\r\nfrom the compromise with the Council of Basel; and he now experienced\r\nthe truth of his own prediction. Mutual recriminations were exchanged\r\nbetween Philibert and himself; each charging the other with violating\r\nthe Compacts, and enforcing their special form of ritual in a manner\r\ncontrary to the agreement.\r\n\r\nThe Praguer soon showed their indignation at the treatment which their\r\nelected Archbishop had received; and they indignantly demanded that\r\ntheir nomination should be accepted. Sigismund, however, was now being\r\ndrawn by his supporters into a complete Catholic reaction. Monasteries\r\nand friaries were restored; and ecclesiastical property, which had\r\npassed into other hands, was re-demanded. This was a violation, in\r\nspirit at least, of the understanding on which Sigismund had been\r\nallowed to return. Rokycana’s denunciations grew fiercer than before;\r\nand Sigismund answered them by threats which induced the preacher to\r\nbelieve that his life was in danger; so he at last sought safety in\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nIf Sigismund had behaved treacherously and violently towards the\r\nleaders of the Calixtines, he was equally faithless in his dealings\r\nwith the Taborites. The determined opposition which they had offered\r\nto him on his first return to the kingdom, had compelled him to make\r\nconcessions in order to secure their allegiance; and he had promised\r\nthat they should be allowed the use of their own ritual, for six years,\r\nwithout any disturbance; and that they should also be permitted to\r\nchoose six Councillors for the government of their town. Doubtless\r\nthe King had at once looked forward to an opportunity for breaking\r\nthese promises; but, when they first returned to Prague, it seemed\r\npossible to weaken the Taborites by the milder process of stirring up\r\ndivision between them. Soon after the battle of Lipaný, Rokycana had\r\nsubmitted to Peter Payne the question whether Wyclif and Hus had ever\r\nheld the Taborite doctrines on the seven sacraments and the invocation\r\nof saints, and other subjects of dispute. Payne delayed his answers to\r\nthese questions; and Sigismund found the matter still unsettled on his\r\narrival. He, therefore, peremptorily demanded that the required opinion\r\nshould at once be given. Payne, thereupon, candidly replied that he\r\ncould not discover any evidence of the acceptance of these Taborite\r\ndoctrines by Wyclif or Hus; but that, nevertheless, he (Peter Payne)\r\nwas prepared to support those doctrines. The answer was a dangerous\r\none; for, while it emphasised the difference between Payne and the\r\nCalixtines, it provoked a fierce denunciation from the Taborite Bishop\r\nof Pilgram (Pelhr̆imov), who was indignant that his party should be\r\ndeprived of the protection of two such honoured names. But, though\r\nSigismund might have found it more natural to accomplish the fall of\r\nhis enemies by sowing division among them, Bishop Philibert, and his\r\ncolleagues from Basel, required more peremptory measures. So Sigismund\r\nonce more broke his promises, and threatened to trample out the\r\nTaborites with fire and sword.\r\n\r\nThese repeated acts of duplicity naturally alienated from him many\r\nof those who had at first been disposed to support him; and when a\r\nman named John Rohac set up a fortress on Mount Sion and denounced\r\nthe King and his policy, the Assembly of Bohemia actually refused to\r\nvote funds for suppressing the insurgents; and they told the King\r\nthat he might march against Rohac at his own cost. Rohac, indeed, was\r\nsuppressed after a short struggle; but his example was imitated by\r\nmany nobles and citizens; and Sigismund at last left Prague in disgust\r\nand disappointment and retired into Moravia. He seems to have had some\r\nintention of again betaking himself to Basel, partly to hinder the\r\ngrowing quarrel between the Pope and the Council, partly, no doubt,\r\nto secure the help of both against his rebellious subjects. But, on\r\nhis way through Moravia, he was taken ill, and on the 9th of December,\r\n1437, he died at Znojem.\r\n\r\nThe power which he had gained by his re-conquest of Bohemia, and the\r\nfierce hatred which he had excited by his whole career, were alike\r\nmanifested by the events which immediately followed his death. The\r\nchampions of Sigismund at once proposed that his son-in-law, Albert of\r\nAustria, should be chosen king. This, they said, had been Sigismund’s\r\ndying wish; and they backed Albert’s claim, not only by reference to\r\nhis marriage with Sigismund’s daughter, but by the old promise of\r\nCharles IV., that the House of Austria should succeed the House of\r\nLuxemburg on the throne of Bohemia. But, on the other hand, the House\r\nof Hapsburg had always been looked upon as enemies by all the most\r\npatriotic Bohemians, and there were at least three reasons why Albert\r\nhimself should be specially unpopular in the country. He had tried\r\nto use the power which Sigismund had entrusted to him, to drag away\r\nMoravia from its connection with Bohemia. He had desired to Germanise\r\nall the cities that fell into his hands; and he had taken an active\r\npart in the war against the Utraquists. Although, therefore, the\r\nchampions of Albert succeeded in obtaining a majority in his favour in\r\nthe Bohemian Assembly, Rokycana and his followers were able to rally\r\nround them some of the most active spirits of the nobles and many of\r\nthe knights and citizens, and to secure the election, at Tabor, of\r\nLadislaus, King of Poland.\r\n\r\nLadislaus was chosen on the ground that, if they could not get a\r\nBohemian prince, the Bohemians should at least secure a king from a\r\nnation allied to them in language and race. This King accepted the\r\ncrown on behalf of his younger brother, Casimir; and a war followed\r\nwhich might have been somewhat uncertain in its results, but that\r\nAlbert, who had also been chosen King of Hungary, was compelled to\r\nhasten to that country to resist the invasion of the Turks. There, too,\r\nhe found opposition, on the ground of his strong German feeling; many\r\nof the Hungarian nobles were disposed to revolt from him; and, worn out\r\nwith anxiety and illness, he retired to Vienna, and died there, less\r\nthan two years after his election.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZNAYM (ZNOJEM), SCENE OF SIGISMUND’S DEATH.]\r\n\r\nHis death at once produced a change in the feeling of Bohemian parties.\r\nHis widow, Elizabeth, might have been unfortunate in her marriage\r\nwith a German, and not much more fortunate in being the daughter of\r\nSigismund; but she was, none the less, the granddaughter of Charles\r\nIV., and, through the mother of Charles, the most direct descendant of\r\nthe old Bohemian line. The sentiment which naturally gathers round a\r\nwidowed queen seems always to have exercised an important influence in\r\nBohemian history, and all parties agreed to suspend their strife until\r\nthe expected heir should be born. But no sooner was it known that the\r\nqueen had been delivered of a son than the question at once arose of\r\nwho was to be his guardian. The new Emperor, Frederick III., at last\r\nconsented to accept this office; and, both as Emperor and head of the\r\nHouse of Austria, he was considered the rightful protector of the young\r\nLadislaus.\r\n\r\nBut it was evident that neither party desired that Bohemia should be\r\nat the mercy of the Emperor of Germany, and it was therefore necessary\r\nto choose two Councillors to govern the kingdom during Ladislaus’\r\nminority. Ulric of Rosenberg, who had now become the leader of the\r\nCatholic party, decided to hold aloof, for a time, from politics;\r\nand, consequently, Meinhard of Neuhaus, who had represented the\r\nultra-moderate party of the Utraquists, was chosen as the best\r\nprotector of the Catholic interests in the Council, while a nobleman\r\nnamed Ptac̆ek represented the party of Rokycana.\r\n\r\nThe disorder which naturally arose in a country divided by factions,\r\nand without a recognised king, was further increased by the revival\r\nof those theological disputes, which had fallen, for a time, into the\r\nbackground. The Taborites, whom their enemies had, no doubt, supposed\r\nto have been crushed at the battle of Lipaný, had proved themselves\r\na still vigorous force in the struggle against Albert; and Ptac̆ek\r\nbecame extremely jealous of their power, and desired to suppress\r\nthem. A quarrel between one of the leading Taborites and some of the\r\nSilesians led to a Silesian invasion of Bohemia, and gave Ptac̆ek\r\nan excuse for demanding the suppression of the Taborite League.\r\nRokycana for the moment intervened to make peace among the parties,\r\nand attempted to secure a free discussion of points of difference.\r\nAt first the Taborites were unwilling to come to these discussions,\r\ndeclaring that they were afraid of Ptac̆ek’s tyranny, and appealing to\r\nSigismund’s former promise that they should not be compelled to change\r\ntheir ritual; but at last, after actual violence had been resorted\r\nto, and the Taborite town of Vodnian had been taken by storm, both\r\nparties consented to a meeting at Kutna Hora for a final discussion of\r\nthe points at issue. Two presidents were chosen for the conference,\r\nWenceslaus of Drachov, as representing the Calixtines, and Peter Payne,\r\nas the champion of the Taborites.\r\n\r\nPayne had recently called out an unexpected burst of enthusiasm among\r\nhis Bohemian friends. Returning, apparently, from a visit to Basel, he\r\nhad been seized at Nürnberg by a nobleman named Burian von Gutenstein,\r\nand held as a prisoner. Burian offered to surrender him to Henry VI. of\r\nEngland; but Henry feared that he might be intercepted and rescued at\r\nBasel. That Council was now openly at war with Eugenius IV.; and, while\r\nthe Pope was summoning an opposition Council at Ferrara, the Baseler,\r\non their side, had declared Eugenius deposed, and had set up an\r\nanti-pope of their own. Many of those who had most earnestly wished for\r\nthe meeting of the Council were now withdrawing their support from it;\r\nand Henry VI., who had been one of the first to urge its convocation,\r\nnow denounced and feared it. He, therefore, advised Burian to send his\r\nprisoner direct to the Pope at Ferrara or Florence. This Burian was\r\nwilling enough to do; but Eugenius was occupied with his contest with\r\nthe Council of Basel, and with his attempt to help the Greeks against\r\nthe Turks; and he found it difficult to deal properly with his proposed\r\nprisoner. Under these circumstances the Taborite towns cut the knot\r\nby offering to raise a large ransom for Payne. This was accepted by\r\nEugenius, and Payne was restored to the Taborites amid great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of his foreign origin and of the offence which he\r\nhad given by his recent decision, Payne was readily accepted by the\r\nTaborites as their spokesman at this, their final appearance as\r\ncontroversialists. Nay, so ready were they to abandon, in his favour,\r\nsome of their strongest feelings, that they actually rebuked Pr̆zibram\r\nfor disputing with Payne in the Bohemian language, since the Englishman\r\nwas unable to understand it. The questions in dispute seem mainly to\r\nhave turned upon the nature of the presence of Christ in the Sacrament;\r\nand the controversy grew so hot that Koranda, the Taborite priest, made\r\nthe same challenge to Pr̆zibram which Hus had formerly made to the\r\nMasters who wished to condemn Wyclif; namely, that, if convicted, he\r\nwould be willing to be burnt as a heretic, provided that his opponents\r\nwould consent to the same punishment in case of conviction. Finally,\r\nthe discussion was referred to the next Assembly of the Estates of\r\nBohemia, an Assembly which, under Ptac̆ek’s influence, readily decided\r\nin favour of the Calixtines, as against the Taborites.\r\n\r\nUlric of Rosenberg, who had previously held aloof from the discussions\r\nof the Assembly, now saw his opportunity in the division of his\r\nenemies; and he hoped to use the Calixtines as allies in crushing out\r\ntheir more formidable opponents. But, while this scheme was still\r\nin a state of preparation, Ptac̆ek died, and the discussion of the\r\nUtraquists was temporarily brought to an end by the rise of a new\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nThis leader was a young man of twenty-four named George of Podĕbrad.\r\nHis father had been a friend and protector of Z̆iz̆ka; and his family\r\nhad been more steadily identified with the Utraquist cause than most of\r\nthe nobles of Bohemia. He was the godson of Z̆iz̆ka, had distinguished\r\nhimself in the war between Ladislaus and Albert, and had since\r\nbeen made the captain of the Bunzlau (Boleslav) Circle, a specially\r\nProtestant district. He seems to have had a singular gift of inspiring\r\nconfidence, and a diplomatic power of seizing opportunities. Although\r\nhe defended the claims of Rokycana to the archbishopric, the Taborites\r\nwere at first as zealous as the Calixtines in welcoming him as a\r\nleader; and he adroitly contrived to bring to the front once more that\r\nproposal for the recognition of the Compacts of Basel, which appeared\r\nto be a bond between the different sections of the Utraquists. Nor\r\nwas it to the Utraquists alone that he at first appealed for support;\r\nfor his demand that the Emperor should surrender Ladislaus to the\r\nBohemians attracted the sympathies of the more patriotic Catholics. By\r\nhis help negotiations were opened with Emperor and Pope; and the death\r\nof Eugenius IV. seemed to open a new chance for the concession by the\r\nPapacy of some of the Utraquist demands. But, though Pope Nicholaus\r\nmight be willing, for a time, to use friendly words, the Emperor\r\nFrederick was more uncompromising, and he absolutely refused to restore\r\nthe young king to the Bohemians.\r\n\r\nGeorge of Podĕbrad now decided to make himself more completely master\r\nof the situation; and a quarrel which had recently broken out between\r\nthe Bohemians and Duke William of Saxony gave him an excuse for raising\r\na large force of soldiers. His work was soon simplified by the action\r\nof his opponents. Cardinal Carvajal, coming to Prague to negotiate\r\nabout the demands of the Bohemians, expressed a desire to see a copy\r\nof the actual Compacts of Basel; and, on getting it into his hands,\r\nhe tried to carry it away from the city. Several of the Utraquist\r\nleaders followed him, and forced him to surrender the document; but\r\nthis attempt finally destroyed any hope which the Utraquists might have\r\ncherished of a compromise with the Catholics. The sincere Utraquists at\r\nonce drew together; while Meinhard of Neuhaus openly took the Catholic\r\nside. The excitement in Prague became intense, and George of Podĕbrad\r\nseized the moment to march to the city. After a short pretence of\r\nnegotiation, he suddenly attacked the town on the 3rd of September,\r\n1448, and captured it by assault. Rokycana was welcomed back in\r\ntriumph, and Meinhard of Neuhaus was thrown into prison, where he soon\r\nafter died.\r\n\r\nAlthough George had acted as the champion of the Utraquists in their\r\nstruggle against Albert and Neuhaus, his first object in seizing\r\nthe power into his hands was to restore order in the country. For\r\nthat purpose, he wished to conciliate the Catholics, as much as the\r\nUtraquists; and he brought into office Zdenek of Sternberg, one of the\r\nfiercest of the Catholic party. He even succeeded in gradually drawing\r\nthe Rosenbergs to his side; though, at the same time, he always treated\r\nRokycana as his chief adviser, and was urgent for his recognition as\r\narchbishop. This policy was extremely resented by the Taborites, and\r\nthey were ready to combine, even with the discontented Catholics,\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, in 1452, George was at last chosen Administrator of the\r\nkingdom, he found opposition to his authority, not only in the extreme\r\nRoman Catholic centres of Budweis (Budejóvice) and Pilsen (Plz̆en),\r\nbut also in Tabor, and other Taborite towns. George, however, had now\r\nrisen to the position of a national leader, accepted by all those\r\nwho preferred the order and unity of Bohemia to the triumph of any\r\nparticular party. Rokycana, on his side, had gained an influence among\r\nthe Utraquists, as a whole, which made the resistance of any section\r\nof them far less formidable than it had been in former days. Moreover,\r\nthe chief interest of the country was, for the moment, centred rather\r\nin the recovery of their king than in the decision of any theological\r\ndoctrine; and, in their desire to rescue Ladislaus from Frederick, the\r\nBohemians received the sympathy of the Hungarians, and even of the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\nThis discontent with Frederick led to actual preparations for war on\r\nthe part of the three nations aggrieved by his action; and George, in\r\nhis capacity of Governor of Bohemia, had an excuse for raising forces\r\nwithout at once declaring the purpose for which they were to be used.\r\nWhen, however, his preparations were complete, in August, 1452, he\r\nsuddenly marched against Tabor. At first the Taborite priests were\r\ndisposed to rouse the citizens to their usual attitude of determined\r\nresistance; but, as soon as George appeared before the town, the old\r\nunconquerable spirit vanished; the citizens were seized with a panic,\r\nand consented to recognise George as Governor. Still, it might have\r\nseemed as if this recognition was to be merely a part of a compromise,\r\naccording to which the rights and liberties of the Taborites were\r\nstill to be recognised; but when, in pursuance of this belief, they\r\nsent their Bishop Nicholaus and their favourite priest, Koranda, to\r\nPrague, to discuss their points of difference with the Calixtines,\r\nNicholaus and Koranda were suddenly seized and imprisoned, until they\r\nwould consent to yield to Rokycana’s authority. Even this did not\r\nkindle the old spirit of the Taborites; and, in December, 1452, the\r\nCalixtine priests entered Tabor, and celebrated Mass with those rites\r\nand ornaments which the Taborites had fought so hard to suppress.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Tabor marks a great crisis in the Utraquist movement; and\r\nthough there is another phase of that movement which has yet to be\r\nrecorded, the distinctive character, that had given it such life and\r\nforce, must evidently have been doomed to destruction before such an\r\nevent could have occurred. Important as was the element contributed\r\nto the Utraquist cause by the learned scholars of the University of\r\nPrague, they could never have produced so vivid an effect on Europe had\r\nthey not been backed by the fiery enthusiasm, the high ideals, and the\r\nferociously combative spirit of the flail-bearing peasants of Tabor.\r\nIt was the flails of the Taborites which made the Moravian nobles\r\nflinch from the battle of Vys̆ehrad; it was they who had scared every\r\narmy which came against them, from the time of the first battle of the\r\nZ̆iz̆ka Hill to the day when Cardinal Cesarini fled in panic from the\r\ncountry which he had been so certain of conquering. The zeal of the\r\nTaborites for purity and simplicity of life had supplied an impulse\r\nwhich no theological doctrine could of itself contribute; while their\r\nintolerance of priestly forms, and their belief in the superiority of\r\nthe Congregation of the Faithful to the decrees of any learned society,\r\nhad given that democratic colouring to the movement which has made\r\ntheir traditions such a lasting force in Bohemia, even to the present\r\nday. At the same time their turbulent savagery and fierce intolerance\r\nmade it necessary that, at some time or other, they should be absorbed\r\nin a broader and more orderly organisation. The Independents had now\r\nfound their Cromwell; and to him they were obliged to sacrifice much of\r\nthe liberties for which they had originally fought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE FALL OF TABOR TO THE DEATH OF GEORGE OF PODĔBRAD.\r\n\r\n(1452-1470.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parallel suggested at the end of the last chapter between Cromwell\r\nand George of Podĕbrad must, like all such parallels, be taken with\r\nvery considerable modifications; and it was perhaps not one of the\r\nleast points of difference between these two rulers that George’s first\r\nobject, after the establishment of his power, was to bring back the\r\nKing, who was still detained by the Emperor of Germany. As a concession\r\nto one of the complaining nations, and very likely with the hope\r\nof exciting jealousy between them, Frederick had brought the young\r\nLadislaus to Vienna; but, if this step conciliated the Austrians, it\r\ndoes not appear to have excited any opposition on their part to the\r\nreturn of Ladislaus to Bohemia. Nor were the Catholic nobles able to\r\nmake use of his restoration for weakening the power of George; they\r\ncould not even prevent the Utraquists of the Assembly from resolving\r\nthat Ladislaus should be asked, before his coronation, to accept the\r\nCompacts of Basel.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of the boy king were evidently somewhat painfully divided.\r\nThe education which Frederick had given him had produced in him a\r\ngreat zeal for the Catholic cause; but the zeal was modified, and\r\nsomewhat counteracted, by his deeply rooted conviction that it was\r\nto George of Podĕbrad alone that he owed the possibility of becoming\r\nKing of Bohemia. Both these feelings were made manifest on his arrival\r\nin Prague. When Rokycana came out at the head of the clergy to\r\nwelcome the young king, Ladislaus turned away and would hardly notice\r\nthe Archbishop, until George induced him to thank Rokycana for his\r\naddress. But, when the procession reached the Catholic College, the\r\nking sprang from his horse and did special reverence to those clergy\r\nwho had been restored to their livings on the occasion of Sigismund’s\r\ncoronation. The struggle between Ladislaus and his strong-willed\r\nviceroy was of short duration. George was resolved not to yield on\r\nthe question of Rokycana’s position; and the young king left Prague\r\nin great indignation. He did not, indeed, at once abandon his efforts\r\nfor effecting a reconciliation between the Pope and the Bohemians, at\r\nthe expense of the popular Archbishop; but, on his second visit to\r\nPrague in 1457, he found both George and Rokycana still obstinate in\r\ntheir resistance; and the poor boy’s efforts at the settlement of the\r\ndifficulties of the Church were cut short by illness and death. On his\r\ndeathbed he again renewed to George his admission that he owed the\r\ncrown to his influence; and he entreated him to govern the dependent\r\nprovinces justly, and to secure that those, who had followed the young\r\nKing from Austria to Bohemia, should be allowed to return peaceably to\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\nThe death of Ladislaus extinguished the last claim to direct descent\r\nfrom the old Bohemian kings; and the consequence was that a larger\r\nnumber of candidates than usual came forward to claim the Bohemian\r\ncrown. Charles VII., King of France, based his pretensions to the\r\nthrone on the ground that, had Ladislaus lived, he would have been\r\nmarried to Charles’s daughter. The Duke of Saxony pleaded that he had\r\nactually married the sister of Ladislaus. The Dukes of Austria tried\r\nto revive the recollection of the promise of Charles IV.; while the\r\nKing of Poland appealed to the fact of his former election, which had\r\nfallen into abeyance after the birth of Ladislaus. Of these candidates,\r\nthe King of France and the Duke of Saxony seem to have been by far the\r\nmost pressing and sanguine in their candidature; and both of them paid\r\ncourt to George; while both of them hoped, by securing a dependency of\r\nBohemia, to get a footing in the kingdom before their actual election.\r\nThe King of France declared his intention of taking Luxemburg under his\r\nspecial protection, while William of Saxony appealed to the desire of\r\nsome of the Silesians to choose him as their ruler.\r\n\r\nBut both these candidates had reckoned their chances without knowing\r\nthe wishes of the two most important men in Bohemia. George was\r\ndetermined that Silesia should never be separated from the Bohemian\r\ncrown; and he had equally little wish that any foreigner should again\r\nbecome king of Bohemia. Rokycana, on his part, was not less determined\r\nthat no one but George should be the King. In addressing the Bohemian\r\nAssembly in March, 1459, the Archbishop boldly grounded his appeal for\r\nGeorge not only on his Bohemian birth, the purity of his life, and his\r\nproved power to defend them against their enemies, but also on his\r\ndevotion to the Utraquist cause. Openly as this claim was put forward,\r\nit does not seem to have alienated the Roman Catholic nobles. George’s\r\nconciliatory policy towards the Catholics, and his personal friendship\r\nfor some of their leaders, readily induced them to acquiesce in an\r\nelection which would secure a strong national king to Bohemia. Yet\r\nfrom the very first Rokycana succeeded in giving a Utraquist colouring\r\nto the decision. While the envoys of Duke William of Saxony were\r\neagerly expecting the election of their master, their meditations were\r\ninterrupted by a simultaneous burst of ringing from all the churches\r\nin Prague; George speedily issued from the Town Council House with the\r\nsword of honour borne before him; and he was led across the square\r\nto the Teyn Church, where, after a general singing of the Te Deum,\r\nRokycana called on the people to thank God for giving them a king who\r\nwould stand by their faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE OF PODĔBRAD, FIRST HERETIC KING OF BOHEMIA.]\r\n\r\nThus the election of George of Podĕbrad to the throne of Bohemia marks\r\nthe accession of the first heretic king in the history of Europe.\r\nDoubtless the name of heretic had been freely thrown at Henry IV. by\r\nHildebrand, at Barbarossa by Alexander III., and at Frederick II. and\r\nLouis of Bavaria by every Pope who came in contact with them; but\r\nevery one knew that that name was a mere term of abuse, of no more\r\nspecial significance than “knave” or “ruffian”; and that the real\r\npoint at issue in those quarrels was the question of the exercise of\r\nsome form of secular authority. George of Podĕbrad, on the other hand,\r\nwas deliberately recommended to the Assembly of Bohemia, on account\r\nof his championship of a purely ecclesiastical practice, which had\r\nbeen condemned by one Council of the Church, and by one Pope at least;\r\nand, although a later Council might have partially and hesitatingly\r\nsanctioned the practice, that Council had itself perished in an odour\r\nof heresy and resistance to Papal authority.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, it was not till about four years after George’s\r\nelection that the Pope and the leaders of the Church recognised the\r\nfull significance of the event which had taken place. This delay was\r\ndue to various causes. In the first place, George, who was evidently\r\nconscious of the difficulties of his position, and anxious to maintain\r\nhis character of national king, had begun his reign by making\r\nconcessions to the Catholics. Remembering that Rokycana had never been\r\nformally recognised as Archbishop by any ecclesiastical authority, he\r\nlooked about for some more legally appointed bishop, to consecrate him\r\nas king. In this matter he was assisted by one whom he had good reason\r\nto look to as his friend.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the death of Ladislaus, the Hungarians had decided\r\nto choose, as their king, Matthias, the son of their great general\r\nHuniades. He had been opposed to the rule of Ladislaus, and had even\r\nraised insurrection against him. In one of the battles which followed,\r\nMatthias had been taken prisoner by George, and brought to Prague. On\r\nthe announcement, however, of the Hungarian election, George at once\r\nset his prisoner free, and sent him back to Hungary as King. George\r\nnow in turn appealed to Matthias to send him over two bishops to crown\r\nhim King of Bohemia. Matthias readily consented; and George promised\r\nat his coronation to suppress heresy. A more satisfactory concession\r\nto Roman Catholic feeling was the new arrangement for the government\r\nof the diocese of Prague. The Dean of Prague had claimed to administer\r\nthe diocese, on account of the heresies of Rokycana. The Archbishop,\r\nnaturally enough, protested; and George settled the matter by granting\r\nthe Dean authority over the Catholic priests, while Rokycana was to\r\nretain his authority over the Utraquists.\r\n\r\nBut apart from these concessions to Catholic feeling, the position and\r\npolicy of the Pope tended more than anything else to delay, for a time,\r\nthe collision between him and the heretic king. In the very same year\r\nin which George was chosen King of Bohemia, Æneas Silvius Piccolomini\r\nwas elected Pope of Rome under the title of Pius II. He had been a\r\nzealous champion of the Council of Basel, and had vainly tried to make\r\npeace between it and Eugenius IV. He was therefore not prepared at\r\nonce to condemn a practice which the Council of Basel had, at least\r\nconditionally, sanctioned. Moreover, there was another reason, which\r\noperated still more strongly to induce him to make friends with the\r\nKing of Bohemia. For several years past, the most zealous Catholics\r\nof Europe had been turning their attention away from the divisions\r\nin their own Church, to watch with terror the advance of the Turks in\r\nEurope; and, since the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the sense of the\r\nrelative insignificance of every other question, in comparison with\r\nthe expulsion of the Mahometan invaders, had been growing in the minds\r\nof all true champions of Christendom. If, then, Pius II. could succeed\r\nin winning to this cause the strong championship of the new King, he\r\nmight well wink, for a time, at a few little heresies in doctrine and\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, there were other grounds of opposition to George\r\nwhich were not so easily put aside as mere suspicions of heresy might\r\nbe. William of Saxony was determined to make good his claim on Silesia;\r\nand he was able to appeal to that sentiment of provincial independence\r\nwhich had been growing during the previous century. Neither Z̆iz̆ka\r\nnor Procop had ever been able thoroughly to establish the power of\r\nthe Bohemians over Moravia and Silesia; but the accession of a ruler,\r\nwho seemed to be acceptable to all parties in Bohemia, was likely to\r\nstrengthen the central power at the expense of local aspirations. The\r\nSilesians and Moravians complained that neither of their Assemblies had\r\nbeen consulted in the election of George; and the towns of Moravia,\r\nalways jealous of the power of Prague, and containing a strong\r\nadmixture of German and Catholic elements, were eager to resist the\r\ncentralising power of the heretic king. Albert of Austria was able to\r\ngive them little assistance; and one after another the great cities\r\nof Moravia were reduced to obedience. Znaym (Znojem) was the first\r\nto open its gates to George. Brünn (Brno), more strongly fortified,\r\nwas at first disposed to resist; but it soon yielded to the threat of\r\na siege; and Olmütz speedily followed its example. In Iglau (Jíhlava)\r\nthe Catholic reaction had risen to a greater height than in any of the\r\nother towns of Moravia; and the leaders of the party had deposed the\r\nTown Council and appointed one of their own; but, on being convinced\r\nthat George intended no persecution of the Catholics, Jíhlava also\r\nsurrendered to the king.\r\n\r\nThe resistance in Silesia was of a more determined kind. Broken up\r\nas it was into little Dukedoms, containing a strong German element,\r\nand often influenced by its near neighbourhood to Saxony, Silesia had\r\nprobably at no time felt that strong sympathy with the Bohemians which\r\nstill existed in Moravia, in spite of the apparent triumph of the\r\nCatholic reaction. But the strongest opposition in Silesia came, not\r\nfrom the provincial dukes, but from the town of Breslau. The Bishop\r\nof Breslau seems to have been a more zealous Catholic than most of\r\nhis neighbours; while the citizens had continual causes of rivalry\r\nwith Prague, both on account of trade differences and of exceptional\r\nmunicipal privileges. Breslau, therefore, held out against George, long\r\nafter the rest of Silesia had practically submitted to him. The Pope,\r\nstill hoping to secure the help of George against the Turks, tried to\r\npersuade the Breslauer to submit to the King, and answered to their\r\ncomplaints of George’s heresy that it was for the Pope, and not for\r\nthe town of Breslau, to decide that question. At last, in 1460 George\r\nsucceeded in bringing the Breslauer to terms; but not till he had\r\npromised them considerable ecclesiastical and municipal privileges, and\r\nhad allowed them to defer their homage to him for three years.\r\n\r\nBohemia, however, was not the sole obstacle to the union of Christendom\r\nagainst the Turks. The Emperors of Germany had been growing steadily\r\nweaker during the last century; and many princes had wearied of\r\nFrederick III.’s government, and were looking about for a strong ruler\r\nwho might put down the divisions of the Empire, before leading them\r\nagainst the Turks. Under these circumstances many considered that\r\nGeorge of Bohemia would be the right man for the place. In Hungary,\r\ntoo, Matthias had found great difficulty in holding his own against\r\nthe nobles; and there again, though much against his will, George was\r\nlooked upon as a possible substitute for the unpopular king. In his own\r\ncountry he seemed to be gaining steadily in power. He had restored,\r\nto a great extent, the influence of the towns which had been decaying\r\nduring the Hussite wars, and he gathered round him, not only the most\r\neminent men in Bohemia, but also the most distinguished foreigners from\r\nGermany and Italy.\r\n\r\nBut, in the meantime, Pius II. was becoming alarmed at the power of\r\nthis king. He had hoped that George would have come to Rome to declare\r\nhimself a true son of the Church. He found that no progress was being\r\nmade in the anti-Turkish crusade; and he heard, with alarm, that the\r\nArchbishop of Mainz and other German ecclesiastics were preparing to\r\ndemand the fulfilment of that decree of the Council of Constance,\r\naccording to which a new Council was to be summoned every ten years.\r\nThese suspicions of the Pope were much encouraged by one of his\r\nadvisers, Fantinus de Valle, who tried to convince him that heresy\r\nhad recently gained new life, and that there was a special revival of\r\nthe teaching of Wyclif. At last in January, 1462, George consented to\r\nsend an embassy to Rome, stating the terms on which he would make the\r\nnecessary submission to the Pope. This submission was to be given,\r\npractically, on the recognition by Pius of the Compacts of Basel.\r\nThe Pope was, in the first place, indignant that George should send\r\nrepresentatives instead of coming himself to Rome; and he was perhaps\r\nnot more favourably disposed to the deputation, that Koranda, the\r\nTaborite preacher, was one of the members of it; for Koranda dwelt\r\nwith considerable enthusiasm on the victories of the Taborites in the\r\nUtraquist wars, and maintained that they had acted by the grace of God,\r\nand by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nAt last on March 31st the Pope, in a large assembly, declared that\r\nthe Communion in both kinds, having been condemned by the Council of\r\nConstance, and at one time by the Council of Basel, must be considered\r\nas a disorderly and heretical arrangement; that the Compacts had been\r\nonly a temporary provision; and he now declared them at an end. The\r\nBohemian ambassadors, accompanied by Fantinus de Valle, returned to\r\nPrague to report the news to the Assembly. When they had delivered\r\ntheir report, George declared that the Pope had no right to take\r\naway what the Council of Basel had conceded, and what Eugenius\r\nhad indirectly sanctioned. If any Pope, he said, may undo what his\r\npredecessors have done, what security is there for justice? Then,\r\nreferring to the charge that he had violated his coronation oath in\r\nnot suppressing heresy, he ordered the oath to be read publicly. Then\r\nhe proceeded to say that, in declaring he would suppress heretical\r\nwickedness, he had never meant that he would suppress Utraquism, since,\r\nsaid he, “it is founded in the Gospel of Christ, according to the\r\ninstitution of the primitive Church, and has been conceded to us as a\r\nprivilege of our virtue and devotion, by the Council of Basel. And as\r\nto swearing to oppose the practice, no indeed! But know for certain\r\nthat, since we were born in that Communion, since we were nurtured in\r\nit, and since, by God’s help, we have been raised to the royal dignity\r\nin it, so we promise to guard and defend it, and to live and die for\r\nit; and our wife and children, and all who do any thing for the love\r\nof us, ought to live and die in the defence of the Compacts; nor do we\r\nbelieve that there is any other way of salvation for our souls than the\r\nCommunion in both kinds, according to the institution of our Saviour.”\r\nThen he turned to the nobles who stood about him, and asked them for\r\ntheir decision on the question.\r\n\r\nBut it was no longer possible to maintain the former unity in the face\r\nof this declaration; and while the Utraquist nobles promised readily\r\nto stand by the King, Sternberg declared, on behalf of the Catholics,\r\nthat, while they were willing to support the King in all that concerned\r\nthe honour of his kingdom, they had not been consulted about the\r\nacceptance of the Compacts, and that George must not look to them to\r\ndefend them. The next day Fantinus de Valle was admitted to speak on\r\nbehalf of the Pope. He at once announced the revocation of the Compacts\r\nby Pius, and the deposition from the clerical office of all who gave\r\nthe cup to the laity. Finally he wound up his speech by fiercely\r\nthreatening George with deposition from his throne, if he did not obey\r\nthe Pope. George thereupon turned to the lords, who stood round him,\r\nand said, “Noble lords, you chose me as your king and protector; and\r\nsince you have the power of choosing a lord to protect you, you ought\r\nto work with him.” He then burst out into a fierce denunciation of\r\nthe Roman see, declaring that it was a seat of pestilence; and on the\r\nfollowing day Fantinus was seized and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of hostility seemed now sufficiently clear on both\r\nsides; but again new considerations delayed the final outburst. The\r\nEmperor Frederick had just been engaged in a war with his brother\r\nAlbert about some claims in the Archduchy of Austria. Albert succeeded\r\nin defeating the Emperor, and imprisoning him at Vienna; but George\r\nhastened to Vienna, rescued the Emperor, and restored him to the\r\nthrone. Frederick was full of gratitude; and, while confirming all\r\nthe liberties of Bohemia, he persuaded the Pope to abstain from\r\nexcommunicating George. Pius, still bent on the Turkish war, and\r\nknowing probably that Frederick would find some sympathy for an\r\nanti-Papal policy, consented to a curious compromise. He would not\r\nissue a formal Bull of anathema against George; but he sent messengers\r\nto the citizens of Breslau, releasing them from the treaty which they\r\nhad recently made, and encouraging them to rebel. At the same time he\r\ntried to stir up discontent among the nobles. Many of these had already\r\nbecome alarmed at the growing power of their king. Although he had\r\nstrictly recognised the Constitutional rights of the Assembly, yet the\r\nexpedition to Vienna had given an opportunity for reasserting one of\r\nthe privileges about which the Bohemian nobles were most sensitive;\r\nnamely, the power of refusing to follow the King when he made war\r\noutside the country. The opposition to this expedition was speedily\r\nfollowed by fiercer attacks; and the lords now accused George of\r\nillegal taxation, of interference with the coinage, and of manipulating\r\nthe land register, so as to reduce to feudal submission those who were\r\nlegally independent. With regard to most of the nobles, however, there\r\nseemed an unwillingness at first to push things to an extremity; but a\r\nMoravian named Hynek of Lichtenberg, who had long cherished a personal\r\njealousy against the king, broke out into open insurrection, and set on\r\nfire some of the towns in Moravia. Hoping to secure the Pope’s sympathy\r\nin this rebellion, Hynek sent to Rome for advice as to the course that\r\nhe should pursue; but, before Pius could commit himself to a distinct\r\nanswer to this question, he was taken ill, and died in August, 1464.\r\n\r\nGeorge was well pleased to hear that a Venetian Cardinal had been\r\nelected Pope. But Paul II., though at first apparently friendly to\r\nGeorge, was irritated at some delay in the formal congratulation on his\r\naccession which was due to him from the King of Bohemia. Hynek soon\r\nsucceeded in getting a ready hearing from those Cardinals who were most\r\nopposed to George; and, in spite of the protest of the Bishop of Olmütz\r\nand of many leading people in Moravia, Paul was induced to command\r\nGeorge to withdraw his forces from the siege of Hynek’s castle. George\r\nremonstrated with the Pope; but the previous irritation was revived\r\nby the rumour that George had refused to send ambassadors for fear of\r\ntheir being ill-treated at Rome. The continued attempts on Hynek’s\r\ncastle, and the renewal of the siege of Breslau, were treated as acts\r\nof contumacy; and at last, on August 6, 1465, Paul issued a Bull\r\ndeposing George from the throne, and authorising the legate to punish\r\nall who should still adhere to him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the growing bitterness of the Catholic nobles had\r\nbeen increased by a personal quarrel between George and Zdenek of\r\nSternberg. Although George had been forced to rely upon this nobleman\r\nin his attempts to conciliate the Catholics, he soon found that\r\nZdenek’s character was not deserving of confidence; and he was forced\r\nto refuse him a wardship, for which he applied, on the ground that he\r\nhad abused his trust on a former occasion. This reproach roused Zdenek\r\nto still further opposition; and he induced the lords to found a League\r\nin defence of the Pope. The immediate object of Paul and the rebel\r\nlords was to find a king for Bohemia; and they fixed on Matthias of\r\nHungary, who, though he owed much friendship and help to George, was\r\neasily attracted by the hope of a new kingdom. Many of the important\r\ntowns of Bohemia fell away from the King, and joined the lords against\r\nhim. The four great towns of Moravia formed a special League for the\r\ndefence of the Catholic faith. Pilsen and Budweis, always inclined\r\nto the Catholic cause, speedily joined this League; and the town of\r\nGörlitz, the centre of a special district in Silesia, was hard pressed,\r\non account of its loyalty to the king. George was so eager for peace\r\nthat he consented to a meeting with the rebels at Prague, at which he\r\ndefended himself from the various charges brought against him by the\r\nnobles; and he produced some of the charters from Carlstein to prove\r\nthe legality of his actions. Sternberg refused to believe George’s\r\nassertion that he had shown them all the charters which concerned their\r\nrights; and he demanded that Carlstein and its contents should be\r\nhanded over to himself and his friends, and that the charters should be\r\nsubmitted to the Emperor for confirmation. George indignantly refused\r\nthese proposals, which apparently went beyond the wishes of many of\r\nthe lords; but the Pope frightened the rebels into new opposition, by\r\nanother Bull which placed Bohemia under an interdict.\r\n\r\nGeorge now appealed from the Pope to a new Council, and called on\r\nCasimir of Poland to intercede between him and Paul. Casimir willingly\r\nundertook this negotiation, to which some victories of George seemed to\r\ngive a hope of success; but the attempt at compromise completely broke\r\ndown; and the Poles joined the anti-Utraquist alliance. Rosenberg,\r\nwho had stood by the King for some time, now went over to Sternberg;\r\nand, when George advanced to besiege Olmütz, his own soldiers deserted\r\nhis banner. George was now compelled to retreat to Prague in April,\r\n1469; and the Legate supposed him to be so completely crushed that he\r\noffered him the following terms of peace. He was to return, with all\r\nhis servants, to the Catholic faith; to give up all Articles which the\r\nChurch condemned; to restore all ecclesiastical property; to recognise\r\nMatthias as his son and successor, and allow him to appoint the\r\nArchbishop and the heads of all the churches in Prague; and, finally,\r\nto give up to the Legate the _arch-heretic_ Rokycana.\r\n\r\nNot many even of George’s enemies could have expected him to accept\r\nthese terms; and the consequence of their proposal was an exchange of\r\nfierce defiances between the two parties, ending in a formal election\r\nof Matthias as king of Bohemia, by the rebel nobles. But the heretic\r\nKing was not so easily to be beaten. On January 1, 1470, he sent a\r\nletter to the princes of the German Empire, which reads more like the\r\nmanifesto of a conqueror than the appeal of a defeated and deposed\r\nking. He set forth in bitter language the treatment which he had\r\nreceived from the Pope; and he warned the princes that unless they\r\nwould support him in this crisis, he would break off all connection\r\nbetween Bohemia and the Empire, and stand alone.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime his enemies had begun to be divided among themselves.\r\nThe six towns, of which Görlitz was the centre, had been forced to\r\nyield for a time to the Catholic League and had been placed under the\r\nrule of Sternberg’s son. They had soon found him so oppressive that\r\nthey revolted against him and drove him out; and when Zdenek appealed\r\nto Matthias, Matthias treated his complaints with contempt. Rosenberg\r\nand Gutenstein returned to their allegiance to George; and many of the\r\ntowns of Silesia and Moravia began to cry out against the government of\r\nthe League. Seizing this opportunity, George once more invaded Moravia,\r\nand gained victory after victory over Matthias.\r\n\r\nThe King of Hungary tried to redeem his cause by making an inroad\r\ninto Bohemia; but the cruelties of the Hungarian soldiers led the\r\ncommon people to rise against Matthias’s army; and the Poles seemed\r\nonce more friendlily disposed to their old allies. The Bohemian lords\r\ngradually drifted back to George; and the complaints of the Interdict\r\nwere so loud in the country that the Cardinals began to consider the\r\nadvisability of suspending it. But, before the victory of the Bohemians\r\ncould be secured, the struggle was cut short by the death of King\r\nGeorge, preceded, only a few weeks earlier, by the death of his friend\r\nand supporter, Archbishop Rokycana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BEGINNING OF THE BOHEMIAN BROTHERHOOD TO THE ACCESSION OF\r\nFERDINAND I. TO THE THROWN OF BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\n(1419-1526.)\r\n\r\n\r\nReference has already been made in the previous chapters to a possible\r\nhistorical parallel between the Bohemian struggle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury and the English revolution of the seventeenth; but the most\r\nstartling point of that parallel has still to be mentioned. Whatever\r\nlikenesses or differences there may be between the Calixtines and the\r\nPresbyterians, the Taborites and the Independents, or between George\r\nof Podĕbrad and Oliver Cromwell, there can, at least, be no doubt that\r\nGeorge Fox and his followers found their prototypes in Bohemia in the\r\nfifteenth century; and that the treatment which the Bohemian Quakers\r\nreceived from the Utraquists, exactly foreshadowed the persecution of\r\nthe English Society of Friends by their Puritan countrymen.\r\n\r\nYet even here we must note, by anticipation, an important difference\r\nbetween the Bohemian and the English story. It is perfectly possible\r\nto give an intelligent and connected account of the English history of\r\nthe seventeenth century, without making more than a casual reference to\r\nthe Quaker movement. For, important as the life of George Fox would be\r\nin a general sketch of European philanthropy, it can scarcely be said\r\nto form a necessary link between any two periods of English history.\r\nOn the other hand, it is impossible to give a clear impression of the\r\nBohemian history of the sixteenth century without calling considerable\r\nattention to the work and influence of the Bohemian Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this difference is that the movement for peace, and all\r\nthe ideas that gather round such a movement, were more in harmony with\r\nthe traditions of Bohemia than with those of England. This statement\r\nmay sound startling and paradoxical, when it follows so closely on the\r\naccount of the Utraquist wars. They, more than any other event, have\r\nbrought Bohemia into prominence in European history; and it was chiefly\r\nas fighters that the Bohemians were known to the surrounding nations at\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century. Nevertheless, early traditions,\r\nwhether legendary or historical, never entirely lose their influence on\r\nthe character of a nation.\r\n\r\nThe gentle figure of Libus̆a presiding over a peaceable community is a\r\nmarked contrast to the figures of King Arthur and his Knights of the\r\nRound Table; and the essentially combative character of St. George\r\nsuggests directly opposite ideas of saintship to those represented by\r\nSt. Wenceslaus and St. Adalbert. Nor, when the stream of religious\r\ntradition divides into the two branches of Catholic and Protestant,\r\ndoes the contrast cease between the English and Bohemian models. The\r\nlegendary picture of St. John Nepomuc is more gentle and suffering\r\nthan even the historical facts would justify, and it offers a strange\r\ncontrast to all the traditions that gather round the name of Becket;\r\nwhile the loving and hesitating character of Jan Hus is almost equally\r\nunlike the sternly defiant figure of Wyclif.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another reason for the difference exercised on their\r\nrespective countries by the Bohemian and the English Society. While the\r\nstern idealism of the Quakers hindered them from directly influencing\r\nthe ordinary course of public life, the more accommodating character\r\nof the Bohemian Brothers enabled them to affect the general policy\r\nof their country by sacrificing something of their perfection as a\r\nChristian community. This point of difference will become more clearly\r\nevident as the story proceeds; it will now be sufficient to have called\r\nattention to the fact that, on both these grounds, the followers\r\nof Peter of Chelc̆ic are more closely connected with the course of\r\nBohemian history than the followers of George Fox with the history of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nPeter of Chelc̆ic, like George Fox, was a shoemaker by trade; but he\r\neducated himself carefully, both in the Latin language and in the\r\nhistory of his country. He does not seem ever to have wandered far from\r\nthe little village of Chelc̆ic, in the Prachin district; though the\r\nnarrowness of his geographical outlook did not hinder him from plunging\r\ntolerably early into the important controversies with which his life\r\nwas concerned. It was he who in 1419 propounded to the Masters of the\r\nPrague University his doubts on the lawfulness of religious wars. He\r\nwas not satisfied with the answer which he received; and the weakness\r\nwhich he detected in Jakaubek’s arguments doubtless strengthened him in\r\nhis previous convictions.\r\n\r\nHe gradually adopted all those doctrines which we specially associate\r\nwith the name of George Fox. He rejected all rank and property for\r\nChristians; declared that the conversion of Constantine was the ruin of\r\nthe Church; condemned oaths in law courts, and advocated the passive\r\nendurance of injuries.\r\n\r\nHe soon began to attract attention; and when Peter Payne was driven\r\nout of Prague, after the restoration of Sigismund, he took refuge at\r\nChelc̆ic with his namesake. Apparently a dislike of the new teaching\r\nbegan, a little later, to show itself amongst the Utraquists; for\r\nin 1443 we find that Peter was summoned before an Assembly at Kutna\r\nHora to answer for his doctrines. Nothing seems to have come of this\r\nexamination, for Peter was soon after allowed to publish his first\r\nbook; and others speedily followed, in which he attacked the Pope and\r\nthe clergy.\r\n\r\nJust at this time Rokycana was engaged in a controversy with the\r\nFranciscan Capistran; and, as he had completely triumphed over the\r\nTaborites, he felt ready to sympathise with a new ally against Rome. He\r\neven recommended the writings of Peter to many of his hearers in the\r\nTeyn Church; and Peter was suffered to found a community which took\r\nthe name of the Chelc̆ic Brothers. Many of those who were desiring to\r\nlead a purer and more self-denying life drew near to the Brotherhood;\r\nand the protection and encouragement of Rokycana gave the Society for a\r\ntime the means of easy development.\r\n\r\nBut after the coronation of George of Podĕbrad, Rokycana’s feeling\r\ntowards the Brothers underwent a rapid change. His increase of power\r\nmade him more determined to assert that power at all hazards. Had the\r\nBrothers, indeed, been contented to settle under the priests whom\r\nthe Archbishop chose for them, Rokycana might still have suffered\r\nthem to remain unmolested; but he was irritated by their desire to\r\nform a separate community of their own, independent of all other\r\necclesiastical organisations. While this controversy was still in its\r\nearly stage, Peter died, and his nephew Gregory succeeded to the chief\r\nposition in the society. The new movement had now begun to include men\r\nof all classes, although the nobles were expected to give up their rank\r\nif they actually joined the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nBut a more trying time was coming. In 1461, Gregory came to Prague and\r\nheld a meeting of his friends in the New Town. This was the time when\r\nFantinus de Valle was beginning to excite the suspicions of the Pope\r\nagainst the Bohemian heresies; and, urged on doubtless by Rokycana,\r\nthe King ordered the arrest of the organisers of this meeting on the\r\ncharge of being engaged in a conspiracy. The attempts to convict\r\nthem of political intrigue entirely broke down; and they were then\r\ndenounced as heretics, because of their denial of the doctrine of\r\nTransubstantiation. Under pressure of torture, some of them recanted,\r\nbut Gregory remained firm. He reminded Rokycana of his recommendation\r\nof the works of Peter of Chelc̆ic, and he complained of the\r\nArchbishop’s inconsistency in now denouncing them. Rokycana, however,\r\npersisted in the course on which he had entered, and he refused to\r\nallow the Brothers any of the sacraments of the Church. The Brothers\r\nnow fled to the hills of Reichenau, and resolved to form a stronger\r\norganisation for carrying on their work.\r\n\r\nWith the curious inconsistency which naturally attaches to such\r\nmovements, they showed a great desire to connect themselves, in\r\ntradition if not in organisation, with the older churches; and they\r\nchose as their chief president a regularly ordained priest, named\r\nMichael. They elected a small council to support him in his management\r\nof the Brotherhood; and then they chose their priests by lot, and\r\nrequested them to rebaptise all the Brotherhood. Although, too, they\r\nrejected Episcopacy as a separate dignity, they practically entrusted\r\nto Michael the special duties of a bishop. They now became known as\r\n“Jednota Bratrska,” or the Unity of Brothers; and they speedily began\r\nto attract attention from those who were out of sympathy with the\r\nexisting churches. These were not confined to pure-minded and earnest\r\nmen like themselves, but included wild sects like the Adamites, whom\r\nthe Brotherhood were obliged to repel from their body.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Rokycana’s fury increased. He stirred up both King\r\nand People against the Brotherhood, and persuaded the Assembly to\r\npass a decree ordering the suppression or compulsory conversion of\r\nthe Brothers. Again Gregory protested, and Rokycana now answered that\r\nno new Church could be founded without a special revelation from\r\nHeaven. But when the Brothers offered to explain the nature of their\r\nrevelation, they were answered by imprisonment, torture, and in some\r\ncases by burning. They were now compelled to meet in woods, ditches,\r\nand clefts of the rock to carry on their religious services; yet they\r\nstill stood firm, and Gregory and a woman named Katerina succeeded in\r\nkeeping up methods of communication between them in various parts of\r\nBohemia and Moravia.\r\n\r\nThe deaths of King George and of Rokycana released them for a time from\r\npersecution. The new King showed himself more kindly towards them. This\r\nKing was Ladislaus, the son of the King of Poland. He had been chosen\r\nKing of Bohemia, in spite of the resistance of Matthias. He was only\r\nsixteen years old when he began to reign, and he seems to have speedily\r\nleft on people around him the impression of a youth of mild and weak\r\ntemperament. He released the Brothers who were still in prison, and\r\nthey renewed their propaganda.\r\n\r\nBut their troubles were not yet at an end. Joanna, the widow of King\r\nGeorge, fiercely demanded their suppression; and when they asked for\r\na free discussion on the points at issue, the Masters of the Prague\r\nUniversity informed them that they might come to Prague to state their\r\ndoctrines, and then submit to be convinced of their errors by the\r\nMasters. This was precisely what the Council of Basel had proposed\r\nto the Utraquists themselves, a proposal which they had scornfully\r\nrejected; and the inconsistent character of the claim made by the\r\nUtraquist leaders seems forcibly to have impressed, not only their\r\nCatholic enemies, but even some of their supporters.\r\n\r\nTherefore, under the pressure of public opinion, the Masters of\r\nthe Prague University consented, in 1473, to a discussion with the\r\nBrothers. Strangely enough, the points which the Masters proposed for\r\ndiscussion did not refer to the distinctive doctrines of Peter of\r\nChelc̆ic, but were rather concerned with the meaning of the sacrament\r\nof the Lord’s Supper, and the right means of obtaining salvation. The\r\nBrotherhood denied the doctrine of the Real Presence, and maintained\r\nthat salvation was only to be found in a virtuous life; they were\r\nconsequently denounced by the Masters of Prague, and very little real\r\ndiscussion took place. The Masters soon after issued a letter, in which\r\nthey declared that the Brothers were the chief enemies of the Church;\r\nand they further complained of them for choosing workmen for the office\r\nof priests.\r\n\r\nIt was during this phase of the controversy that Gregory died. He had\r\ncombined remarkable courage with an unselfish devotion to the cause of\r\nthe Brotherhood. He had willingly resigned the first place in favour\r\nof the priest Michael; but he had, none the less, stamped his special\r\nconvictions on the minds of certain members of the Brotherhood; and,\r\nfor a time, on the constitution of the whole society. He warned the\r\nBrothers very strongly against the dangerous influence of learned\r\nscholars, declaring that such people were given to subtle intrigues,\r\ninconsistent with simplicity of life. At the same time he gave\r\nenormous power into the hands of the Bishop of the Church. He was to\r\nhave the right of changing at will the members of the Council who acted\r\nwith him; and no Brother was to be allowed to publish any book without\r\nthe sanction of the Bishop and this Council of his nominees. More\r\ngeneral questions of faith and doctrine were to be decided by synods of\r\nthe Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThough Gregory’s immediate successor in the Brotherhood was a man\r\nof like feelings with himself, neither he nor any one else could\r\nultimately maintain so strict an organisation in its original form. It\r\nhas, indeed, already been hinted that the Bohemian Brotherhood, unlike\r\ntheir English successors, came, after a short time, into friendly\r\ncontact with the outer world; and they suffered in simplicity, while\r\nthey gained in influence.\r\n\r\nThey had now spread over a hundred and eighty square miles of\r\nterritory; and though they still for a time maintained the exclusion\r\nof worldly rank and worldly power from their body, they did not object\r\nto accept the protection of friendly nobles, who remained outside\r\ntheir body. Of these the most prominent and sympathetic was Kostka of\r\nPostupic, whose father had endeavoured to protect the Brothers against\r\nKing George, and whose great-grandfather had fought for Z̆iz̆ka.\r\nThrough his influence many nobles were induced to modify that attitude\r\nof hostility which the democratic tendencies of the Brotherhood\r\nhad naturally produced in them. But this connection could not fail\r\nin time to produce a corresponding change in the feelings of the\r\nBrothers themselves; and some of them began, before long, to propose a\r\nmodification of the stern principles which Gregory had enforced. Might\r\nnot oaths be used on certain occasions? Say, for instance, to free\r\na Brother from unjust charges in a law-court? And might not worldly\r\noffices be held, if they were administered in a right spirit? These\r\nquestions of practice, together with others of pure doctrine, began\r\ngradually to excite divisions in the Brotherhood; and, though it was\r\nsome time before the more moderate creed could gain much ground, it\r\nsoon found a powerful and eloquent supporter, who knew how to make it\r\nacceptable.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1480, Lukas of Prague, a young and learned theologian,\r\nwas admitted into the Brotherhood. He had studied the old classics\r\nand the Fathers of the Church; and he was strongly in favour of a\r\nrelaxation of those stern simplicities on which Gregory had insisted.\r\nHe also desired to give greater prominence to the doctrine of\r\nJustification by Faith, as distinguished from that exclusive advocacy\r\nof good life which had hitherto been the mark of the Brotherhood. Under\r\nthe influence of Lukas, it was resolved in 1490 that the heads of the\r\ncongregations should be allowed to relax the severity of the rules, on\r\ncertain occasions, in regard both to questions of luxury and to the\r\nappeals to the secular power.\r\n\r\nAmos of S̆tekna strongly denounced this compromise, and declared that\r\nthe devil of worldliness had entered as thoroughly into the Brotherhood\r\nas he had entered into the Church in the time of Constantine and\r\nSylvester. Mathias of Kunvald, the successor of Gregory in the\r\nleadership of the Brotherhood, sympathised with the sterner party; and,\r\nby his influence, the relaxing decrees were repealed.\r\n\r\nA project was then started for sending expeditions to various parts of\r\nthe world, in order to find out where the simplicity of faith was still\r\nmaintained. Nothing, however, seems to have resulted from these visits;\r\nand the party of Lukas continued to gain ground. Mathias was unable to\r\nhold his own against the pressure of the new Reformers; so at last he\r\nresigned his judgeship in despair, and consented to the abolition of\r\nthe Small Council. Thereupon Amos of S̆tekna and his followers revolted\r\nfrom the Brotherhood, and founded a new sect which was called, after\r\nits founder, the Amosites. At the same time the old society became\r\ngenerally known as the Bunzlau Brothers, after the town of Jungbunzlau\r\n(Mláda Boleslav) which was now their chief centre.\r\n\r\nTwo results followed from this separation; first, an intensity of\r\nbitterness between the old Society and the seceders, greater than that\r\nbetween the Utraquists and the Brothers; and, secondly, the adoption\r\nof new modifications and compromises by those who adhered to the old\r\nSociety. All compromises have a certain want of logic about them; and\r\ncompromises between the Church and the World on such questions as war\r\nand peace, simplicity and luxury, equality and distinctions of rank,\r\nmust necessarily produce results which, while painful and pathetic to\r\nthose who realise the state of mind of their framers, will strike an\r\nunsympathising world as grotesque and even ludicrous.\r\n\r\nUnder the new arrangements, the members of the Brotherhood were allowed\r\nto wear dress in proportion to their rank, if they did not become\r\nluxurious; but silk and embroidery were still strictly forbidden. The\r\ncompromise about war was still stranger. If a Brother considered that\r\nthe war which his king had made was a just one, he should not refuse to\r\ntake part in it if the lot fell upon him; but he was to try, whenever\r\npossible, to find a substitute, or to get some office about the Court\r\nwhich would excuse him from military duty, or to find some service in\r\nconnection with the army which did not involve fighting; but if he\r\ncould not find any such means of escape, then let him fight in God’s\r\nname; but let him not fight for idle fame, and let him draw the sword\r\nwith reluctance.\r\n\r\nSome of the other modifications of principle seem more in accordance\r\nwith ordinary conceptions of life. Trade might now be practised, but\r\nusury was to be avoided. Beer might be sold, if pure; but it was only\r\nto be sold in a public manner to travellers. Oaths, again, might be\r\ntaken by witnesses if they were convinced of the justice of the cause\r\nin which they appeared.\r\n\r\nBut though such relaxations permitted the extension of membership\r\nto those who had hitherto been excluded from the Brotherhood, the\r\nbonds of the Society were drawn closer than ever round those members\r\nwho had entered it. Strict arrangements were made for the visitation\r\nof the Brothers by their clergy, and for inquiry into the morals of\r\neach family; more rigid limitations than before were placed on the\r\nacquirement of property by the clergy themselves, while the appeals to\r\nworldly law-courts were more carefully guarded against by the provision\r\nof Courts of Appeal within the Brotherhood. Lastly, the exclusive\r\nposition of the Brotherhood was strengthened by a most startling\r\nprovision; if a husband or wife joined the Brotherhood without the\r\nsympathy of their partner, and were afterwards interfered with by him\r\nor her in matters of faith, the brother or sister so hampered might\r\nclaim a divorce, and make a new marriage. Thus, then, the Brotherhood\r\nseemed to be strengthened and consolidated, both by the facilities of\r\nadmission to those who had been repelled by its sterner rules, and by\r\nthe stricter organisation which separated the enlarged Society more\r\ndistinctly from the outer world.\r\n\r\nBut an additional source of strength was soon to be provided by the\r\nrenewal of persecution. This persecution was due to three causes.\r\nSoon after the changes above mentioned, Lukas and some of the other\r\nBrothers had made an expedition to Italy to investigate the condition\r\nof the Waldensian Communities. It was the time of the struggle between\r\nAlexander VI. and Savonarola, and some of the Bohemian missionaries\r\nwere actually present in Florence at the burning of the great\r\nDominican. They returned to Bohemia, offended at the laxity of many of\r\nthe Bohemian Communities, and more embittered than before against a\r\nCatholic Church which was ruled by Alexander Borgia. Alexander, on his\r\nside, had been roused by his struggle against Florence to a fervid zeal\r\nfor the suppression of heresy, and his attention had evidently been\r\ncalled to these strange visitors to Italy. So in 1500 he despatched\r\ninquisitors to Moravia with orders to burn all heretical books, and\r\nespecially those of Peter of Chelc̆ic. So effectively was this part\r\nof the work performed, that of the book which Peter had specially\r\nwritten against the Pope, only one copy is to be found at this day. The\r\ninquisitor, indeed, found it easier to burn books than to convert the\r\nBrothers, but his efforts in that direction were soon supported by men\r\nof a very different type.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was Bohuslav Hassenstein of Lobkovic, a learned and\r\ncultivated scholar, who had gained some reputation as a poet. He had\r\nquarrelled with Pope Alexander, in consequence of the Pope’s refusal to\r\nconfirm him in the bishopric of Olmütz; and he was at first disposed\r\nto look rather to King Ladislaus than to any ecclesiastical authority\r\nfor the restoration of unity and order in the Church. He seems indeed\r\nto have had some genuine zeal for moral reform; for he denounced\r\nthe luxury and pride of the nobility; the gluttony, drunkenness,\r\nand debauchery of all classes; and the general decline of art and\r\nliterature. For all these evils he suggested the one remedy--that\r\nLadislaus should restore religious unity to the Church. But, like\r\nevery earnest man who came in contact with this unfortunate king,\r\nHassenstein began by admiring his gentleness, and ended by despising\r\nhis weakness and incapacity. Since the death of Matthias, Ladislaus\r\nhad been elected King of Hungary; and, if he had been unable to govern\r\nBohemia effectively from Prague, he was still less able to govern it\r\nfrom Presburg. Hassenstein, in despair, turned to his clerical brethren\r\nfor help; and they resolved to promote religious unity by a friendly\r\ncompromise with the Utraquists, which was to be a preparation for a\r\njoint persecution of the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nBut a third enemy of the Brothers proved more efficacious than Borgia\r\nor Hassenstein in stirring up the embers of persecution. Amos of\r\nS̆tekna had heard with renewed indignation of the later modification\r\nof their creed introduced by the Brothers after his secession; and\r\nhe had particularly resented the compromises with regard to war, and\r\nthe completer recognition of the civil power. He, therefore, wrote to\r\nLadislaus that the Brothers were now taking up the position of the\r\nold Taborites. The suggestion was the one best fitted to alarm such a\r\nman. “What!” exclaimed the king, “are they going to imitate Z̆iz̆ka?”\r\n(Z̆iz̆kovati), and he at once rushed into action with all the irritable\r\nenergy of a weak nature.\r\n\r\nOrders were now sent out to all those towns and country districts which\r\nwere directly dependent upon the King, directing them to suppress the\r\nmeetings of the Brothers, to arrest all their teachers, and to send\r\nthem to Prague, where they would either be forced to recant, or else be\r\nburnt alive; and these measures were to be followed by the expulsion of\r\nthe rest of the Brotherhood from Bohemia. Many wholesale arrests were\r\nmade; and one nobleman burnt some of the Brothers whom he found on his\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nBut these summary proceedings of the King roused against him the\r\nconstitutional feelings both of the nobility and of the representatives\r\nof the towns. They disputed his right to act in so arbitrary a manner,\r\neven in the districts dependent upon him; and they feared that he would\r\nsoon exert the same power in the independent towns and on the estates\r\nof the nobles.\r\n\r\nApart from these general objections, there were three noblemen, at\r\nleast, who were disposed to extend their protection to the Brothers;\r\nand it was on their estates that the largest number of the Brothers\r\nwere to be found. Different motives actuated the nobles who took\r\nthis course. Kostka, who has been already referred to, sympathised\r\npersonally with the teaching of the Brotherhood; Schellenberg wished to\r\nspare them, because his wife was a member of their society; Pernstein\r\nwas entirely indifferent to all theological disputes, and therefore saw\r\nno reason for the persecution. But all the three were united in the\r\ndetermination to assert their feudal rights for the protection of their\r\ndependants; and they insisted that, if any Brothers were summoned to\r\nPrague from their estates, they should be secured complete protection\r\nand a fair hearing.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the Brothers arrived in Prague, they found that the\r\nCommittee of the Masters of Arts intended to administer a rebuke,\r\nwithout hearing the defence of the accused parties. Against this\r\ninjustice the Brothers protested; and at last the nobles and citizens\r\nsucceeded in persuading the Masters to withdraw, before the accused\r\npersons were introduced. When, then, the Brothers appeared to answer\r\nthe charges against them, they found themselves in the presence\r\nonly of the nobles and citizens, who informed them that their mere\r\nappearance in Prague was all that was required of them, and that they\r\nmight now go home again. This result was considered to be, in the\r\nmain, a victory for the Brothers. But some of them were more indignant\r\nat the time which had been wasted than pleased at their escape from\r\ncondemnation; and Lukas and his friends followed up this visit by an\r\nenergetic war of pamphlets.\r\n\r\nA new weapon, it must be remembered, was now at the service of all\r\npromoters of new teaching. The invention of printing had quickly spread\r\nto Bohemia; and, in 1468, the fourth printing-press ever established\r\nin Europe had begun to work at Pilsen. The Brothers quickly saw the\r\nadvantage of the new discovery; and, in 1500, they established a\r\nprinting-press at Mláda Boleslav. More than one lady of rank joined\r\nthe Brotherhood; and at least one Catholic noble found the new creed\r\nrapidly spreading among his dependants.\r\n\r\nLadislaus now recognised the mistake which he had made in ignoring the\r\nconstitutional methods of procedure. He therefore resolved to appeal to\r\nthe regular Assemblies for support in his war against heresy; and he\r\nbelieved that he would find his best chance in Moravia. The Moravian\r\nAssembly, unlike the Bohemian, admitted the clergy to a special\r\nrepresentation as a fourth estate; the Bishop of Olmütz had been active\r\nin the propaganda against the Brotherhood; and the great power which\r\nthe Germans and Catholics had obtained in Moravia during the wars,\r\nseemed to point to an easy victory in the Moravian Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut again the King had miscalculated. The victories of the Germans and\r\nCatholics had excited against them a bitterness, both national and\r\nreligious, far more intense than was to be found in other parts of the\r\nkingdom. The cruelties of Sigismund, the Germanising zeal of Albert of\r\nAustria, and the many injustices of Sternberg and the Catholic League,\r\nhad consolidated against them a mass of Moravian feeling, which, if\r\nunable to secure victories on the battlefield, was eminently calculated\r\nto give strength to an opposition in the Assembly. To the Bohemians of\r\nthe western province the Catholics and Germans were enemies, whom they\r\nhad met on equal terms and often thoroughly routed; to the Moravians\r\nthey were victorious tyrants, whose rule was to be thrown off at the\r\nfirst opportunity.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the Catholics demanded that the Assembly should unite\r\nin suppressing the “Picard” heresy, they were startled to find that\r\nthe Utraquists made common cause with the Brothers in opposing this\r\nmotion, and that they actually chose as their spokesman a member of the\r\nBrotherhood named John of Z̆erotin. This nobleman demanded that the\r\ncomplaints already made by the Utraquists should be attended to before\r\nthe question of supposed heresy was dealt with. The Bishop of Olmütz\r\ntaunted Z̆erotin with professing a sympathy with the Utraquists which\r\nhe did not feel; but the Opposition remained firm; and the Assembly\r\nbroke up without coming to any decision.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia the Catholic party had an easier task. The opposition to\r\nLadislaus’s former proceedings had been mainly based on constitutional\r\ngrounds; and it now appeared that there was little religious sympathy\r\nwith the Brotherhood amongst the leaders of public opinion. The power\r\nwhich the Utraquists had gained during the reign of King George had\r\ndrawn them into sympathy with the leading nobles; and Rokycana had\r\ninspired them with a special dislike of the Brotherhood. The Bohemian\r\nAssembly, therefore, consented to a decree, which ordered the burning\r\nof the books of the Brotherhood, the suppression of their meetings, and\r\nthe punishment of their teachers. Elated by this victory, the Bishop of\r\nOlmütz hurried back to Moravia, intending to summon the Assembly for a\r\nsecond meeting, and to secure the reversal of its former decision; but\r\nhe was taken ill on his way, and died before the Assembly could meet;\r\nnor, from that time till the fall of Bohemian independence in 1620, did\r\nany Moravian Assembly consent to the suppression of the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Catholic party found full compensation for their\r\nfailure in Moravia in a specially fierce enforcement of the law just\r\npassed in Bohemia. Indeed, the former patrons of the Brotherhood\r\nbecame so much alarmed, that even Kostka forbade the Brothers to hold\r\nany further meetings on his estates. In spite of this opposition,\r\nthe Brothers still maintained their ground, and even extended their\r\npreaching further; and but few of them could be persuaded, even by the\r\nmost cruel tortures, to submit to the authorities of the Church. In\r\n1511 the Brothers hoped, for a short time, to secure the protection of\r\nthe greatest scholar of the time, Erasmus of Rotterdam. They had heard\r\nof some private letters of his, in which he had defended them against\r\nthe attacks of their enemies; and they now prepared a Defence in Latin,\r\nwhich they sent to him. He thanked them for their communication, and\r\nexpressed approval of at least part of their defence; but he declined\r\nto publish his opinion, on the ground that it would not help them,\r\nand might injure his work. So the persecution went on. Even Peter of\r\nRosenberg found himself unable to protect a Brother, in whom he was\r\ninterested, from being imprisoned and nearly starved to death. He\r\nsucceeded, indeed, in getting him released before death had actually\r\noccurred, and he then urged him to submit to the Church; but the\r\nBrother, though almost too exhausted to speak, steadily refused to\r\nsubmit; and he was set free without further persecution. Lukas, who\r\nwas now the most prominent member of the Brotherhood, succeeded for a\r\nlong time in escaping the vigilance of his persecutors; but, in 1515,\r\nhe was treacherously seized under false pretences, brought to Prague,\r\nand subjected to the torture. When nothing could be obtained from him\r\nby this means, he was set free, on the understanding that he was to\r\nappear before the Utraquist Consistory in April, 1516; but in the month\r\nbefore this appearance was to take place King Ladislaus died, and the\r\npersecution again slackened for a time.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the long absence of the King in Hungary, and the\r\ngrowing sense of his weakness of character, had been producing other\r\ndivisions in Bohemia which gradually turned men’s minds away from\r\nthe religious controversies. The wars of the fifteenth century, like\r\nall wars, had tended to draw the people away from their ordinary\r\noccupations, and to make them dependent on their military leaders.\r\nAs long as the Taborite organisation lasted, its democratic spirit\r\nprovided at least some check on the oppressions of the military nobles;\r\nand the alliance between the peasants and the Order of Knights, to\r\nwhich Z̆iz̆ka had belonged, counteracted any advantages which the\r\nnobles might have gained by their military prowess. But the fall of\r\nTabor had destroyed any hopes, which the peasantry and townsmen might\r\nhave had, of strengthening their position through war.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the peasantry gradually fell back into the\r\ncondition from which they had been escaping in the fourteenth century.\r\nThe right of leaving their masters at their pleasure, of settling in\r\ntowns, and of becoming priests without the sanction of their landlords,\r\nwere gradually taken from them; and at last they were deprived even of\r\nthat right of appeal to the King’s Court by which Charles had protected\r\nthem against the absolute power of their lords.\r\n\r\nBut, though the peasantry were thus crushed back into a state of\r\nserfdom, the organisation of the towns was too strong to yield at\r\nonce to the attacks of the nobles. Unfortunately, however, the lords\r\ngained about this time a new and important ally in their struggle for\r\nsupremacy. The knights, or independent country gentlemen, who had been\r\nsuch zealous rivals of the higher Order in the fifteenth century, had\r\nlately consented to a reconciliation with their opponents; and these\r\ntwo classes were thus able to combine their forces against the towns.\r\n\r\nThe new king was little able to give the weaker party any assistance\r\nin the struggle. Ladislaus had succeeded in securing to his son Louis\r\nthe succession to the crown, and he had even had him crowned during\r\nhis lifetime. But Louis was a boy of ten; he was in the main under\r\nHungarian influences; and he was of course utterly unfitted to control\r\nthe fierce factions which were struggling in Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe three chief points at issue between the Towns and the other Orders\r\nwere, firstly, the right of the Town Tribunals to summon before\r\nthem the nobles and knights in cases specially affecting the towns;\r\nsecondly, the monopoly claimed by the towns in the brewing trade;\r\nthirdly, the right of the towns to send representatives to the Bohemian\r\nAssembly. In 1517, indeed, a nominal settlement was effected on all\r\nthese points by the treaty of St. Wenceslaus. By that treaty the towns\r\nsurrendered their monopoly of brewing, but were secured the peaceable\r\npossession of their other privileges. Such treaties had little effect\r\nin a time of discord, and it was not long before a new violation of\r\ntown rights led to the outbreak of a civil war, in which the citizens\r\ngained some victories. Both parties, however, soon began to desire\r\npeace, and the king was called in to arbitrate between them.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis arrived in Prague to inquire into the circumstances of\r\nthe contest, he found that the disturbances of the country had been\r\nlargely increased by the rise of certain self-seeking politicians,\r\nwho had made their profit out of the difficulties of the kingdom. Of\r\nthese the most powerful and unscrupulous was Lev of Roz̆mital, the\r\nbrother-in-law of King George. He had induced Ladislaus to mortgage to\r\nhim some of the royal property. By this and other means he had gained\r\na great control over the finances of the kingdom, and he refused to\r\ngive any account of his use of that power. He was supported in most of\r\nhis intrigues by a citizen who had recently been ennobled, and who had\r\ntaken the name of Pas̆ek of Wrat. These two men had gradually gained\r\ncomplete power over the government of Prague; and, on one occasion, a\r\nman who had opposed Lev in the Town Council had been dragged out and\r\nbeaten to death.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, there were powerful influences in the country\r\nwhich worked in favour of the young king. One of the Rosenbergs of\r\nKrumov was a rival and enemy of Lev; and an equally formidable opponent\r\nof these schemes was found in Karl, Duke of Münsterberg, and nephew of\r\nKing George. Louis’s uncle, King Sigismund of Poland readily supported\r\nhis nephew by advice and encouragement. The respectable citizens of\r\nPrague were willing to rally round him; and, with such friends as\r\nthese, the boy could venture to act vigorously. He deposed Lev from his\r\noffice, raised a citizen named Hlavsa to the place which Pas̆ek had\r\nformerly held on the Council, and made Karl of Münsterberg the chief\r\ngovernor of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis change of government was intended by Louis and his nearest\r\nadvisers simply as a means of restoring order and honesty in public\r\naffairs; but, besides that result, his action produced another effect,\r\nof which neither the King nor his uncle Sigismund would have approved.\r\nIn choosing his new Councillors from the most respectable politicians\r\nwhom he could find, Louis had unintentionally singled out men who were\r\nin sympathy with the movement for religious reform.\r\n\r\nThat movement had recently entered on an entirely new phase. In the\r\nmiddle of the exciting political struggles in their own country, many\r\nof the Utraquists and Bohemian Brothers had heard with the greatest\r\ninterest that a German monk had come forward to denounce that very\r\npractice of the Sale of Indulgences which had first brought Hus into\r\ndirect collision with the Papacy; and a rapid approximation followed\r\nbetween a section of the Bohemian Reformers and the new German teacher.\r\n\r\nLuther’s attitude towards the followers of Hus is made clear enough\r\nby his own statements. He had been induced to read the story of Hus’s\r\ncareer before he had entered on his actual contest with Rome. He had\r\neven then been impressed by the greatness of the Bohemian Reformer, but\r\nhe had thrust the book aside as likely to lead him into evil. Something\r\nof this old feeling still hung about him in the early part of his\r\nstruggle. And, when Eck brought against him the charge of favouring the\r\nBohemian heresy, he had been inclined to repel it with indignation.\r\nYet it was that very charge which had induced him to return to the\r\nstudy of Hus; and he soon began to express so earnest an admiration\r\nfor the Bohemian leader that his enemies spread the rumour that he was\r\nhimself a Bohemian, who had been educated in Prague on the writings of\r\nWyclif. Nay, they even went so far as to Bohemianise his name--a change\r\nin which they doubtless took a malicious pleasure, for the Bohemian\r\nword “Lŭtr̆e” means a scoundrel. Several letters of encouragement\r\nfrom scholars and clergymen at Prague were addressed to Luther in the\r\nearliest years of his struggle; and he declared that he would himself\r\nhave come to Bohemia had he not feared that such a visit would have\r\nseemed like a flight from his enemies.\r\n\r\nBut he very soon began to recognise the distinction between his own\r\nposition and that of Hus. This difference he has referred to in several\r\nof his writings; and perhaps the passage in his “Table Talk” is the one\r\nwhich will be best remembered, from the vigorous metaphor by which he\r\nillustrates his opinion: “Hus,” he said, “cut down and rooted out some\r\nthorns, thickets, and chips from the vineyard of Christ, and chastised\r\nthe abuses and evil life of the Pope. But I, Dr. Martin Luther, have\r\ncome into an open, flat, and well-ploughed field, and have attacked and\r\noverthrown the doctrine of the Pope.”\r\n\r\nIf this distinction between the attacks of Hus on the immorality of the\r\nPapacy, and his own attack on its doctrines, seemed to Luther to put\r\nthe earlier Reformer in a less important position than that which he\r\nhimself occupied, he must have felt this difference still more strongly\r\nwith regard to the later Utraquistic movement. Very few of the leaders\r\nof that movement had ever desired that complete separation from Rome\r\nwhich Luther soon perceived to be an absolute necessity. They had been\r\ndriven, against their will, to combine the assertion of their national\r\nindependence with resistance to the authority of the Pope; but, when\r\nthe deaths of King George and Rokycana had removed at once the main\r\nground of Papal hostility to Bohemia, and the most determined asserters\r\nof an independent national Church, the Utraquists began to show an even\r\npainful eagerness for a reconciliation with the Papacy. They felt the\r\nneed of a priesthood which possessed the dignity and legal stability\r\nsecured by the consecration of Romanist bishops; and they not only sent\r\ntheir clergy to Italy to obtain this privilege, but they even welcomed\r\nin priests of other countries, who had been appointed to their offices\r\nin the orthodox manner.\r\n\r\nLuther, in his desire to win the Bohemians to his side, energetically\r\nprotested against this practice. He pointed out to them the dangers\r\nto morality and order which they were incurring by letting in priests\r\nof whom they knew nothing, except that they had been consecrated;\r\nmen who, in many cases, had left their country from discreditable\r\nreasons. Finally, he appealed to them not to sacrifice that Bohemian\r\nindependence for which they had struggled so long, nor to compromise\r\nwith the representatives of those who had shed the blood of Hus and\r\nJerom.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Luther himself fell into the very same error against\r\nwhich he had so energetically warned the Bohemians. During these\r\nnegotiations he put his chief trust in a man who was totally unworthy\r\nof his confidence. This was Gallus Cahera, the son of a butcher of\r\nPrague, who had studied in the University and gained a Master’s degree.\r\nHe had then taken Holy Orders, and been appointed parish priest of\r\nLitmerice. From thence he had gone to Wittenberg; and so completely\r\ndid he gain the confidence of the Reformers that, in 1523, Luther\r\nsent him back to Prague with letters to the Utraquistic congregation,\r\nurging them to choose him as their leader in the work of reform. He\r\narrived there just when Louis was accomplishing his changes in the\r\nadministration of Bohemia. In the following year the Utraquists elected\r\nCahera as the Administrator of their Consistory; and he proceeded to\r\ndraw up a series of Articles for their acceptance, which approached\r\nnearer than any of their previous formularies to the Lutheran creed. A\r\nproposal, indeed, to condemn the celibacy of the clergy was rejected\r\nby the Assembly; but the Articles which were adopted were sufficiently\r\nextreme to alarm the old-fashioned Utraquists; and Pas̆ek and his\r\nfriends began at once to make use of this feeling.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Utraquism had always been most powerful when\r\nit had been connected with efforts for Bohemian independence; and,\r\nunfortunately, the national feeling of Bohemia was generally closely\r\nconnected with a hatred of all German influence. Pas̆ek had been able\r\nto appeal to this prejudice, in resisting the appointment of Karl of\r\nMünsterberg, who was not a Bohemian by birth; and, though the hatred of\r\nthe tyranny of Lev and Pas̆ek had been strong enough for the moment\r\nto destroy the effect of this appeal, yet the dread of a German heresy\r\nwas easily awakened in the citizens of Prague. Louis had already called\r\non the Moravian Assembly to condemn the new doctrines; and that body,\r\nwhich had defended the national movement of the Bohemian Brotherhood,\r\nreadily denounced the teaching of the monk of Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nPas̆ek soon succeeded in gaining help from an unexpected quarter.\r\nCahera was a weak and unprincipled man, and his opponents were easily\r\nable to work upon his vanity. They proposed to him the splendid task of\r\nreconciling the Utraquists to the Pope; and Cahera was so dazzled by\r\nthe prospect of the fame and dignity which such an undertaking promised\r\nhim, that he quickly drifted away from his former friends and helped\r\nforward Pas̆ek’s intrigues. In vain did Luther remonstrate with Cahera\r\non this desertion of his principles. The reaction steadily went on.\r\nPas̆ek was re-elected to the Council; Louis, forgetful of his former\r\ndistrust, encouraged the town in its new course; Karl of Münsterberg\r\ncame over to the Catholic side; and the Assembly of Bohemia once more\r\nappealed to the Pope to ratify the Compacts of Basel.\r\n\r\nBut Pas̆ek was not yet satisfied. He and Lev of Roz̆mital were\r\ndetermined to recover the power which they had lost; and they found\r\nthat the discovery and denunciation of heretics were the easiest\r\nmeans of obtaining this end. They therefore seized the opportunity of\r\nCahera’s change of policy to pass laws to strengthen the position of\r\nthe Administrator of the Consistory. At the same time some Lutheran\r\nsympathisers were expelled from Prague, and a regular organisation\r\nwas formed in the Small Division to crush opposition. The Reformers\r\nsoon began to complain of the armed men who were allowed to parade\r\nthe streets. But these complaints were quoted by Pas̆ek’s friends\r\nas evidence of an heretical plot. Suspicion was stirred up against\r\nthose reforming clergy who still remained in Prague, and at last a\r\ntradesman named Zika appeared before the Council to denounce all those\r\nleading councillors who were opposed to Pas̆ek. Hlavsa and his friends\r\nwere seized and thrown into prison, and Pas̆ek endeavoured to obtain\r\nevidence against his leading opponents by putting their followers to\r\nthe torture. Lev of Roz̆mital was restored to all his former power, and\r\na system of terror was gradually established, under which the Brothers\r\nand all Lutheran sympathisers were subjected to various kinds of\r\npersecution. Karl of Münsterberg tried at first to check the progress\r\nof this tyranny; but the intriguers had succeeded for a time in\r\nwinning to their side the king and the Hungarian bishops, and by their\r\ninfluence the opposition of the governor was silenced.\r\n\r\nA general atmosphere of suspicion now began to dominate the city and\r\nits neighbourhood. Private avarice and vindictiveness found their\r\nopportunity under the plea of orthodoxy. Men stopping to speak to each\r\nother in the streets were accused of heretical conspiracies, and the\r\nenforcement of a more rigorous form of confession put a powerful weapon\r\ninto the hands of the persecutors. Many workmen were deprived of their\r\nmeans of livelihood by the espionage to which they were subjected, and\r\ncitizens coming to Prague to claim their debts were thrown into prison\r\non a charge of heresy.\r\n\r\nSuch a tyranny necessarily overshot its mark. Many of the nobles were\r\nindignant at the power which Roz̆mital had gained, and he soon received\r\na startling proof of their hostility. Remembering the bait by which\r\nthey had drawn Cahera to their side, Pas̆ek and Roz̆mital despatched\r\nan embassy to the king, who was then at Presburg, to persuade him to\r\nsecond them in an appeal to the Pope to ratify the Compacts of Basel.\r\nThe Rosenbergs seized this opportunity for a blow at the new rulers of\r\nPrague. They despatched a counter embassy to the king, in which they\r\ndenied Roz̆mital’s right to speak in the name of the nobles of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nA still more impressive protest followed. Hlavsa and one of his friends\r\nhad escaped from prison, and they now appeared in Presburg to convince\r\nthe king of the injustice of their imprisonment. They showed, too, that\r\nRoz̆mital and his friends had exceeded the powers granted to them, and\r\nhad inflicted sentences which were greater than any that the king had\r\npermitted. Louis was impressed by these statements, and he at once\r\nwrote to Roz̆mital, ordering him to reverse his illegal sentences, to\r\ngive Hlavsa and his friends a fair trial, and to restore order and\r\njustice in Prague.\r\n\r\nKarl of Münsterberg and Lev of Roz̆mital combined to defy the king’s\r\ncommands; and after vainly appealing to the Town Council of Prague to\r\nresist this act of rebellion, the king summoned a Bohemian Assembly\r\nto meet at the town of Kolin on the Elbe, and excluded from its\r\ndeliberations Karl, Lev, and all their supporters. He then secured the\r\ntrial and acquittal of Hlavsa and his friends, and punished Prague for\r\nits contumacy by depriving it of its civic rights. So far, however,\r\nwere the Praguer from yielding that they now expelled from the city\r\nthe wives of the men whom they had been ordered to recall; and they\r\neven imprisoned a citizen whom Louis had sent to Prague to recover the\r\nproperty of which the Town Council had deprived him.\r\n\r\nBut, absolute as was Roz̆mital’s rule within the walls of Prague, a\r\ncurious story of the time reminds us of the formidable influences\r\nwhich were counteracting his power in other parts of Bohemia. Peter of\r\nRosenberg had bequeathed to Roz̆mital the castle and town of Krumov;\r\nbut Peter’s nephew, Henry of Rosenberg, maintained that such an\r\nalienation of the property was contrary to the settlements under which\r\nit was held. Lev thereupon summoned Henry to appear before the law\r\ncourt in Prague, to answer for his resistance to his uncle’s will. When\r\nthe messengers appeared at Krumov with the letters of summons, Henry of\r\nRosenberg at once threw them into prison. He then summoned them before\r\nhim, made them eat the letters which they had brought, gave them wine\r\nto enable them to swallow this strange food, and then hunted them with\r\ndogs from the gates of his castle.\r\n\r\nAlthough this story shows that Roz̆mital’s power was confined within\r\ncertain local limits, yet, within those limits, he could not only\r\nresist the remonstrances and commands of Louis, but could even hamper\r\nin an important way his general schemes of policy. This power for evil\r\nwas shortly to receive a terrible manifestation. While the Bohemians\r\nand Hungarians had been wrangling, the Turks had been steadily\r\nadvancing in Europe. Soliman the Great had considerably increased the\r\nmilitary prestige of his race; and Louis was startled, in the middle\r\nof his domestic troubles, by the news that Belgrade had been captured\r\nby the Turks. Then the young king appealed to the Bohemians to stand\r\nby him and his Hungarian subjects in their resistance to this terrible\r\ninvader. The Rosenbergs and other nobles responded to this appeal; but\r\nRoz̆mital and the Council of Prague, while ashamed to give a direct\r\nrefusal, yet succeeded in inventing all manner of delays, so as to\r\nprevent their troops from coming in time to the king’s help. Some\r\nof the Bohemian nobles wished to wait till their whole forces were\r\ngathered, but the Hungarians soon grew impatient of delay, and on the\r\n29th of August, 1526, they insisted on joining battle with the Turks\r\nat Mohács. Louis, anticipating a certain defeat, fled from the field\r\nbefore the battle began; but, in his flight, his horse fell into a\r\nswamp, and his unfortunate life of failure was cut short at the age of\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nThe result of the battle was as Louis had foreseen. The Hungarians\r\nwere signally defeated, and the Turks speedily followed up their\r\nvictory by the capture of the fortress of Buda. A long series of\r\nintrigues followed in Bohemia. The Austrian party were supported by the\r\nRosenbergs, and the Saxon party were led by Lev of Roz̆mital; but the\r\nopposition of Lev was finally bought off, and the Archduke Ferdinand,\r\nbrother of the Emperor Charles, and brother-in-law of the unfortunate\r\nLouis, was elected king of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nREIGN OF FERDINAND I.\r\n\r\n(1526-1564.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Ferdinand was known, and to some extent feared, as a stern\r\nand rigid Spaniard, yet a belief in his desire for justice, and a\r\nwish to secure any strong protector against the champions of disorder\r\nin Bohemia, quite overbalanced any fears that might be caused by his\r\nCatholic tendencies. Indeed, although many stipulations were made\r\nbefore he was accepted as king, the fears of his subjects were far\r\nless excited about those religious liberties for which they had so\r\nlong struggled than about questions of national independence. The\r\ndangers which seemed most to threaten Bohemian liberty were the\r\npossibility of Ferdinand’s election to the throne of Spain, and the\r\nextreme probability of his election to the throne of Hungary; while the\r\nsubjects which ranked next in importance to these were the maintenance\r\nof the right of the Assembly to elect their future King, and the\r\npreservation of the supremacy of Bohemia over the dependent crown lands.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, did the controversies at the beginning of a reign\r\nmore completely fail to foreshadow the events which should make it\r\nmemorable. Ferdinand himself was as blind to the issues before him as\r\nwere the people whom he came to rule. He thought that in the local\r\nindependence of Moravia and Silesia, which had been so much increased\r\nby their frequent separation from Bohemia in the late wars, he would\r\nfind an admirable opportunity for strengthening his position at the\r\nexpense of the Bohemians. At first his theory appeared plausible\r\nenough; for the Moravians and Silesians, indignant at not being\r\nconsulted in the first election of Ferdinand, were easily flattered\r\nby his apparent tenderness for their provincial feelings; and they\r\nconsented to a concession to his wishes, which the Bohemians had\r\nrefused to make; for while the Bohemians would only recognise Ferdinand\r\nas their freely elected King, the Moravians and Silesians consented to\r\nadmit his hereditary claim to the throne, and consequently fixed the\r\ncrown more permanently on the House of Hapsburg. But even the Bohemians\r\nfinally agreed that, if Ferdinand should find himself incapacitated by\r\nold age or ill-health, he might commit the task of government to his\r\nson Maximilian. Ferdinand doubtless hoped that both these concessions\r\nwould tend to consolidate the power of the House of Hapsburg, and to\r\nstrengthen his personal influence, as well as his legal claims; but\r\nbefore the end of his reign he had cause to regret most bitterly the\r\nincrease of the Moravian independence, and to grudge the power which\r\nhe had conferred on a son, who seemed determined to reverse the most\r\nimportant points of his father’s policy.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, his own thoughts and those of the country\r\nwhich he governed were concentrated on the struggle in Hungary. John\r\nZapolya, the Voyvode of Transylvania, had begun, even before the death\r\nof Louis, to show signs of an ambition which would carry him far beyond\r\nthe limits of his small principality; and he was strongly suspected\r\nof having intrigued with the Turks at the battle of Mohács. After the\r\ndeath of Louis, the intrigues and claims of Zapolya rapidly increased,\r\nand he was at last crowned king of Hungary. Ferdinand, however, as\r\nbrother-in-law of Louis, was resolved to dispute Zapolya’s claim; nor\r\nwas this desire due to a mere greed of territory. The growing power\r\nof Soliman the Great was becoming a serious danger to the peace and\r\nliberty of Europe; and Ferdinand felt that the possession of the crown\r\nof Hungary would enable him to protect his hereditary dominions, and,\r\nindeed, the whole Empire, against the aggressions of the Turk. It must\r\nbe owned that, considering Zapolya’s evident inclination to intrigue\r\nwith Soliman, Ferdinand’s conception of duty was not by any means\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the feeling in Bohemia was considerably divided.\r\nIn spite of the dislike of the Turk, which was then common to all\r\nChristian nations, the Bohemians looked with alarm on any increase in\r\nthose burdens of taxation which already weighed so heavily upon them;\r\nand, as already hinted, they dreaded the rule of a King, who might find\r\nit more convenient to reign at Presburg than at Prague. So strong was\r\nthis feeling, that the Bavarians, who had hoped to win the crown of\r\nBohemia for their Duke, now believed that they could form a Bohemian\r\nparty, which should commit itself openly to the side of Zapolya. On\r\nthe other hand, the men of Prague, who groaned under the tyranny of\r\nPas̆ek and Cahera, had reason for hoping that Ferdinand would come to\r\ndeliver them from their sufferings. He had already set free a friar\r\nwho had been imprisoned by Pas̆ek for denouncing his government; and\r\nhe had given the citizens good reason to believe that nothing but the\r\nHungarian war was preventing him from doing justice and restoring order\r\nin Prague. Those citizens, therefore, eagerly desired his success; and\r\nas long as the struggle was mainly between Ferdinand and Zapolya, the\r\nvictory seemed likely to fall to the Austrians.\r\n\r\nFerdinand returned in triumph to Prague; and, as the first step towards\r\nthe restoration of order, he deposed the Councillors, who had been\r\ngoverning the city, and restored the separate jurisdictions of the Old\r\nand New Towns. In previous times, indeed, the union of the different\r\nquarters of the city had been looked upon as a means of securing the\r\nliberties of Prague; but Pas̆ek and Cahera had turned this union into\r\nso effective a means of tyranny over the freer spirits of the New\r\nTown, that the citizens of the latter district hailed the separation\r\nwith enthusiasm; and they declared that their beloved King Charles\r\nhad returned to earth in the form of their new ruler. This exultation\r\nwas soon cut short by a new, and far more dangerous, outbreak of the\r\nHungarian war. Soliman, no longer relying mainly on the intrigues\r\nof Zapolya, poured his forces anew into Hungary, reconquered all\r\nthe territory which had been lost, marched into Austria, and rapidly\r\napproached Vienna. Even now, though they sent troops to the defence\r\nof Vienna, the help of the Bohemians was grudgingly given, and\r\nwas hindered by their old suspicion of the power of the Germans.\r\nNevertheless, they joined in the war. The Viennese were roused to an\r\nheroic resistance; and, after a fierce struggle, the Turks were driven\r\nback from the walls of Vienna. The ships which Soliman had brought into\r\nthe Danube were destroyed; and he was compelled, for a time, to make\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nFerdinand now hastened back to Prague, and found that Pas̆ek and\r\nCahera had recovered their power in the city. Although Hlavsa and his\r\nfriends had been allowed by Ferdinand to return from exile, Pas̆ek’s\r\nparty had succeeded in hampering their freedom and annoying them in\r\nvarious ways. Knowing the King’s strong Catholic feelings, Pas̆ek had\r\nhoped to conciliate his favour by giving a religious colouring to his\r\npersecution; and several of the Bohemian Brothers had been singled\r\nout for torture and burning. But Ferdinand seems to have thoroughly\r\nunderstood the self-seeking character of the intriguers who were\r\ngoverning Prague; and, resolving to show that he was not to be trifled\r\nwith, he banished Pas̆ek and Cahera from Prague, and pronounced the\r\nformal acquittal of Hlavsa and his friends. Even those against whom\r\nthere was reasonable suspicion of heresy were allowed to escape by the\r\nuse of elastic formulæ; and it seemed for the moment as if a happier\r\nand better government were really to be introduced into Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut his Catholic training, strengthened by the circumstances of his\r\nbrother’s struggle against the German Protestants, had produced\r\nin Ferdinand two strong aspirations, which had been enormously\r\nstrengthened by the difficulties of the Turkish wars. These were the\r\ndesire for the consolidation of the power of the Hapsburgs, by the\r\nunion of the different hereditary dominions of their House; and the\r\ndesire for union of the Church by the crushing down of the various\r\nsects. These two objects were to be carried out side by side, and each\r\nwas to be brought into prominence as opportunity occurred. It was to\r\nthe latter object that he first desired to address himself; and certain\r\ncircumstances had at this time specially directed his attention to the\r\nBohemian Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe peasant rising in Germany had produced great dread of the teaching\r\nof the Anabaptists; and, after the peasants had been crushed, many of\r\nthis sect had fled to Bohemia to escape persecution. The Brotherhood\r\nhad noticed that the new-comers agreed with them on the question of\r\nthe necessity of a second baptism; and Lukas and other leaders of the\r\nBrotherhood had desired, on this ground, to negotiate further with the\r\nAnabaptists. A closer inspection proved that no two bodies had less of\r\nspiritual sympathy than the fiery revolutionists who followed Thomas\r\nMünzer and the peaceable and orderly inheritors of the traditions of\r\nPeter of Chelc̆ic. But this negotiation had called unfriendly attention\r\nto the proceedings of the Brothers; and the alarm which it excited was\r\nfurther increased by the action of one of those noblemen who had begun\r\nto patronise the Brotherhood. This was Conrad of Krajek, the member of\r\na family who had defended the Brotherhood against Ladislaus. Conrad had\r\ngranted to the Brotherhood a church on his estate, which had long been\r\nleft without a pastor, and the new clergyman had removed from it the\r\nornaments which the Brothers considered idolatrous. Ferdinand demanded\r\nthe restoration of the ornaments, and Conrad refused to obey. The\r\nTurkish wars hindered Ferdinand from pressing his demand at this time;\r\nbut Conrad felt his danger, and resolved to take further steps for the\r\nprotection of the Brotherhood. He saw that the German Protestants had\r\ngreatly strengthened their position by their recent publication of\r\nthe Confession of Augsburg; and it occurred to him that, if a similar\r\npublicity were given to the doctrines of the Brotherhood, they also\r\nmight be placed in a better position in the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN AUGUSTA.]\r\n\r\nThe drawing up of this Confession brought into prominence a man whose\r\ncareer was to have an important influence, both on the history of the\r\nBrotherhood and on the policy of Ferdinand. This was John Augusta,\r\nthe son of a hatter in Prague. He had been born in 1500; and, though\r\nwithout any regular learned education, he had acquired a useful\r\nknowledge of Latin. He speedily made his mark in the Society; and in\r\n1532 he was admitted into the smaller governing council. It was just\r\nat this time that Conrad of Krajek had been convinced of the need of\r\na formal Confession of Faith for the Brotherhood; and Augusta was\r\nappointed to undertake this work. This document was not only intended\r\nfor circulation among the immediate friends and acquaintances of the\r\nBrotherhood; but it was also hoped that it would attract the sympathies\r\nof the German princes, and particularly of the Margrave of Brandenburg.\r\nThere was also another ally whom Augusta was particularly anxious to\r\nwin to the side of the Brothers. Luther, as it will be remembered, had,\r\nin the early period of his public career, made somewhat eager advances\r\ntowards the Utraquists; but, when the treachery of Gallus Cahera had\r\ndisgusted and repelled him, he had turned for sympathy to the Bohemian\r\nBrotherhood. Lukas and other leaders had been well disposed to meet his\r\nadvances; but, on closer contact, they found three barriers apparently\r\ninsurpassable. The Brothers, like many other people, had been startled\r\nand shocked by Luther’s doctrine of Justification by Faith _alone_.\r\nThey believed their fears of this doctrine to be justified by\r\npersonal observation; for it seemed to be leading, in many cases, to\r\ncarelessness and even immorality of life, however much it might seem to\r\nLuther to be the assertion of a more spiritual creed against the belief\r\nin mere dead works. Secondly, the Brotherhood came far nearer to the\r\nZwinglian doctrine of the Sacrament than Luther could at all approve;\r\nand, thirdly, the same ascetic tone which induced them to shrink from\r\nthe Lutheran laxity of life, made the Brothers unwilling to accept a\r\nmarried priesthood. The contention had become so sharp between Lukas\r\nand Luther, that Luther, who showed himself the more moderate of the\r\ntwo disputants, had felt it better to break off the correspondence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there were many, both in the ranks of the Brotherhood and\r\nof the German Protestants, who desired a renewal of this intercourse;\r\nand, as Lukas was now dead, there seemed less difficulty in beginning\r\na new correspondence. Augusta, therefore, went to Wittenberg, and\r\npresented the Confession to Luther. Luther seems throughout to have\r\nshown a generosity and breadth of sympathy towards the Brothers\r\nwhich were not always characteristic of him. He readily praised a\r\ngreat part of the Confession; he rejoiced in their agreement about\r\nthe main doctrines of Christianity and the rejection of many Papal\r\nsuperstitions; and he declared that their mistakes about the Sacraments\r\nand the question of Faith and Works were to be attributed partly to\r\ndifferences of language, and partly to a want of clear perception\r\non their part of the points at issue. With regard to the married\r\nclergy, it soon became clear that the difference between Luther and\r\nthe Brothers was not one of doctrine; but that it was due partly to\r\ncircumstances arising out of the persecution which the Brotherhood had\r\nsuffered, partly to a certain ascetic tendency which inclined them to\r\nlook upon celibacy as the higher state. Luther therefore consented\r\nreadily and warmly to recommend the study of the Confession to his\r\nfriends; and a few years later he even agreed that it should be printed\r\nand published for them at Wittenberg.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by Luther’s sympathy, both Krajek and Augusta thought\r\nthat the time had come for presenting their Confession of Faith to\r\nFerdinand himself, and asking for a milder judgment than he had at\r\nfirst been disposed to pass upon them. But the temporary retirement\r\nof Soliman from Europe had now left Ferdinand at liberty to carry out\r\nhis plans of uniformity. Although the Brotherhood had now broken off\r\ntheir intercourse with the Anabaptists, yet Ferdinand still remembered\r\nthat attempt against them; and he was even more embittered by the\r\nrecollection of Krajek’s disobedience. He therefore not only refused\r\nto consider the Confession, but early in 1535 he issued an order for\r\nthe expulsion of the Brothers from all the towns immediately dependent\r\non the king’s authority. The Utraquists eagerly seconded the Catholics\r\nin this persecution; and the towns of Vodnian, Klattov, and Taus\r\n(Domaz̆lic̆e) were the first to carry out the order. The expelled\r\nBrothers were also summoned before the royal Court in Prague to answer\r\nfor their offences. Amongst others, two young lords of Janovic, who had\r\nbeen known as patrons of the Brotherhood, were summoned to Prague, and\r\ncondemned to imprisonment in the Black Tower of the Castle. A Brother\r\nnamed John Zbornik, generally known as John the Hermit, was summoned\r\nat the same time. Conrad of Krajek, however, maintained that Zbornik\r\nwas his serf, and that the young lords of Janovic were not responsible\r\nfor him. Then Conrad was ordered to appear himself, to answer for his\r\ninterference with the law, and at the same time to produce Zbornik.\r\nConrad came with Zbornik, and also with a large attendance of knights\r\nand lords; but, in spite of their protests, Zbornik was condemned\r\nwithout any regular trial, and imprisoned in the Castle for three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nConrad did not yet abandon the cause; and he persuaded Augusta to\r\ndraw up an additional statement of their Faith for presentation to\r\nFerdinand. In this copy the original Article about the Sacraments\r\nwas modified, so as not to offend the Lutherans; and Luther himself\r\nexpressed his approval of this second document. Conrad now hastened to\r\nVienna, to entreat for the liberation of Zbornik and the young lords of\r\nJanovic. He dwelt much on the illegality of the proceedings connected\r\nwith their imprisonment; but Ferdinand maintained the most despotic\r\nprinciples of authority, declared that he was only bound to protect the\r\nCatholics and the Utraquists, and told Krajek that the devil had led\r\nhim to his present faith. Krajek retorted that it was Christ, and not\r\nthe devil, who had led him there; and that, if Christ was a “Picard,”\r\nthen he (Conrad) was so too. Yet, in spite of his defiant tone,\r\nFerdinand seems to have been impressed by Conrad’s protest; for, in the\r\nfollowing year, Zbornik and the young lords were released from prison.\r\n\r\nThis release, however, was rather a concession to the principle\r\nof legality than an abandonment by Ferdinand of his plans for\r\necclesiastical uniformity; and he fully hoped, by securing firmer\r\nsupport amongst the Utraquists, to crush the extreme Protestant sects.\r\nHe had promised, at his coronation, to support the Compacts of Basel;\r\nand, in May, 1537, he appealed to the Bohemian Assembly so to enforce\r\nthe Compacts as to suppress those sects who did not accept them. After\r\na sharp discussion, the representatives of the Brotherhood were\r\npersuaded to withdraw from the Assembly; but it was soon found that\r\nthe attempts at union had been brought no nearer to their realisation\r\nby this exclusion. Many of the Utraquists objected to the Compacts of\r\nBasel, as an attempt to substitute a new document for the words of\r\nScripture. Others maintained that the Catholic bishops had violated the\r\nCompacts, and that they were still eager to suppress the Utraquists.\r\nThough, therefore, the Catholics and Utraquists agreed in hating\r\nthe Brothers, they were not able to combine their forces for their\r\nsuppression; and a new outbreak of the Turkish war still further\r\nhindered the designs of Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Augusta had been trying to strengthen the union\r\nbetween the Brotherhood and the foreign Protestants. He had visited\r\nBucer and Calvin at Geneva, had received a kindly welcome from them,\r\nand had accepted many of Calvin’s doctrines about Predestination. But\r\nhis greatest hope and his strongest personal sympathies were always\r\ndirected to Wittenberg; and his translation and eulogy of a pamphlet\r\nwritten by Luther excited Ferdinand’s indignant attention even during\r\nthe Turkish war. Threatened with arrest and imprisonment in consequence\r\nof this publication, Augusta fled once more to Wittenberg. There he was\r\nagain welcomed by Luther and Melancthon; and he complained to them of\r\nthe growing corruptions of the Church in Bohemia, and of the increase\r\nof luxury, even in the Brotherhood. Finally, he implored Luther to\r\ninterfere in these matters, and to establish a new system of church\r\ndiscipline in Bohemia. Some suggestion of the kind had apparently\r\nbeen made by other Bohemian exiles; but Luther was far too wise to\r\nlisten to the proposal. He had been willing enough to discuss matters\r\nof doctrine with the Brothers, and to welcome them as friends and\r\nallies; but he had none of the national mania for Germanising other\r\ncountries; and he recognised to the full the necessity for a variety\r\nof customs, and even for modifications in the expression of doctrine.\r\n“Do you,” He said to Augusta and his friends, “be the Apostles of the\r\nBohemians; I and mine will be the Apostles of the Germans. Do you act\r\naccording to the opportunities presented to you, and so will we.”\r\nIf Joseph II., in the eighteenth century, had been half as wise as\r\nLuther was in the sixteenth, the relations of Germans and Bohemians\r\nto each other might even now be considerably more friendly than they\r\nare. After this interview Augusta returned to Bohemia, and devoted\r\nhimself, for the next year or two, partly to a defence of the Brothers\r\nagainst the attacks of the Utraquists, partly to an effort to restore\r\nthe Brotherhood itself to that simpler mode of life from which it was\r\ndrifting away.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the progress of Protestant doctrine in Germany\r\nhad produced considerable influence on many of the old-fashioned\r\nUtraquists in Bohemia; and they now offered fresh hindrances to\r\nFerdinand’s efforts after uniformity. Mistopol, the Administrator of\r\nthe Utraquist Consistory, and Mitmánek, a leading preacher, had been\r\nparticularly prominent in their attacks on the Catholics; and when,\r\nin 1543, Ferdinand once more called together the Bohemian Assembly,\r\nhe found that his offer to enforce the Compacts of Basel was met by\r\na reaffirmation of the Four Articles of Prague in their simplest and\r\nextremest form. This roused him to great indignation; and he now\r\ninsisted on further restrictions, both in ritual and preaching, and\r\neven forbade any general meeting of the Utraquists, under penalty to\r\nperson and property. He insisted, however, that the celebration of the\r\nanniversary of the death of Hus should be maintained as one of the\r\nordinary observances of the Church. But Mistopol succeeded in seizing\r\nthe opportunity of this anniversary for a violent sermon against the\r\nCatholics, which he preached in the old Bethlehem chapel of Hus. For\r\nthis defiance Mistopol was summoned before the Court of Prague; and\r\nthough his sentence was deferred for a time, Mitmánek, his chief\r\nsupporter, was banished from the country. The attempt to conciliate the\r\nUtraquists having thus failed, Ferdinand opened negotiations with the\r\nPope, which were to lead to the calling of the Council of Trent. Such\r\nwas the relation of parties to each other when, in 1546, the death of\r\nLuther removed the last hindrance to the outbreak which was to change\r\nthe conditions both of Germany and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Schmalkaldic League, in 1542, had already prepared\r\nthe Protestants for collective action; and the threatening attitude\r\nof Charles V., coupled with the proposal for a Council, which would\r\nundoubtedly condemn Protestantism, seemed to many of the more eager\r\nspirits to justify immediate action. The Landgrave of Hesse and John\r\nFrederick, Elector of Saxony, determined to anticipate the attacks of\r\nCharles; and, not many months after Luther’s death, they marched into\r\nBavaria and attacked the town of Ingolstadt. But, scarcely was this\r\nstep taken, when it was discovered that Charles had provided against\r\nthe attacks of his enemies, by bringing to his side one of the most\r\nformidable of them. Moritz of Saxony had been induced, by the promise\r\nof his cousin’s lands, to desert the cause of the Protestants, and\r\nto secure his new possession by force of arms. Ferdinand hoped to\r\nreconcile the Bohemians to Moritz by persuading him to renew a former\r\ntreaty of hereditary alliance between Saxony and Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut the Protestant feeling of Bohemia was too strong to be juggled\r\nwith in this manner; and, on March 18, 1546, a League had already\r\nbeen formed for the protection of the civil and religious liberties\r\nof Bohemia. They even went so far as to appoint a Committee of Eight,\r\nwho were to manage the affairs of the kingdom, and to raise arms and\r\nmen without asking the leave of the king. When, then, John Frederick\r\nof Saxony suddenly entered Silesia, and seized on the monastery of\r\nDobrilug, Ferdinand found that large numbers of the Bohemians refused\r\nto repel this invasion of Bohemian territory; and even those who went\r\nto the war were unwilling to fight. Though Ferdinand at once sentenced\r\nto death the leading mutineers, he could not hinder the citizens of\r\nPrague from further negotiations with John Frederick. From refusal to\r\nfight they rapidly passed into more active opposition; and at last\r\nthey even enabled Caspar Pflug to raise forces for the assistance of\r\nthe Elector.\r\n\r\nAs the struggle went on, the enthusiasm of the Bohemians rose; and\r\non April 7, 1547, the fiercer spirits of Prague suddenly seized the\r\nTown Council Houses and bridges into their own hands, demanded a\r\nsafe-conduct for one of the men whom Ferdinand had just condemned\r\nfor mutiny, and insisted on the imprisonment of one of Ferdinand’s\r\nCouncillors, and the recall to the Teyn Church of a preacher who had\r\nbeen expelled for heresy. They even compelled many of the Catholic\r\nleaders to give in their adherence to the League; and all seemed\r\nready for an actual revolution. Suddenly, while the excitement was\r\nstill at its height, the news came that John Frederick of Saxony had\r\nbeen completely overthrown at the battle of Mühlberg. Instantly the\r\nmore timid of the conspirators deserted the League, and even sent\r\ncongratulations to Ferdinand on his victory. But the fiercer spirits\r\ndesired to fight it out; and, as the troops of Ferdinand and Charles\r\nadvanced upon Prague, the citizens rang the alarm bell, and the\r\npeasants flocked in with their flails from the neighbouring villages,\r\nand repelled the first advance of the royal forces. The Burgomasters\r\nand leading Councillors had had no desire to resist the King; but they\r\nwere completely overborne by the fiercer citizens; and, on the 6th\r\nof July, the anniversary of the death of Jan Hus, an appeal was sent\r\nround to the nearest Circles, calling on all the citizens to come to\r\nthe defence of Prague. Yet, in spite of this apparent vigour, there was\r\nlittle real vitality in the movement; the leaders of the League had\r\nhoped for the help of the Saxons; and when that failed, they had had\r\nno desire to continue the struggle. The men who had now undertaken the\r\ndefence were utterly unorganised, and without any capable leaders. The\r\nfirst forces, who came in from the neighbouring districts were defeated\r\nby the troops of Charles; and, on the 8th of July, the city consented\r\nto submit unconditionally to Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of Ferdinand on the recapture of Prague were marked\r\nby an unexpected moderation. Comparatively few of the conspirators\r\nwere put to death; the great bulk of them were let off with fines,\r\nor the surrender of lands; and most of the liberties of Bohemia were\r\nconfirmed. But it was felt, nevertheless, that all who had sympathised\r\nwith the insurrection were in a difficult and dangerous situation;\r\nand the Utraquists, who had begun the movement, combined with the\r\nCatholics, who had in many cases yielded to it, to lay the whole guilt\r\nupon the Bohemian Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe Bunzlau district had no doubt been conspicuous in its refusal to\r\nsend forces to the Saxon war. Three or four of the lords, who were\r\ncondemned for their share in the insurrection, had been known for their\r\nprotection of the Brothers; and some of the Elders of the Brotherhood\r\nhad ordered a day for prayer and fasting during the insurrection. It\r\nwas resolved, therefore, to seize this opportunity for crushing this\r\nunpopular sect, and the chief suspicion was directed against John\r\nAugusta. He had indeed protested against the insurrection from the\r\nfirst, but it was proved that he had come to Prague while it was\r\nstill going on; a visit to Liegnitz in Silesia was also looked upon as\r\nsuspicious; while undoubtedly the chief charges against him were his\r\nknown influence in the Brotherhood and his connection with Wittenberg.\r\nEven the lords who had hitherto been favourable now disowned the\r\naccused; and the Captain of Moravia, himself a member of the Society,\r\ntold Augusta that he ought to have prevented the insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Ferdinand was ordered to take measures for carrying out\r\nthe intended persecution; and in the following year a Commission was\r\nappointed, which reconstituted the Town Councils in various districts,\r\nand ordered the new Councillors to proceed rigorously against the\r\nBrothers. The chief persecution began at Litomys̆l, where several men\r\nwere arrested for singing hymns at the funeral of a Brother. On their\r\nrefusal to abandon the Brotherhood they were imprisoned in the White\r\nTower of the Castle of Prague; and, when threats and entreaties were\r\nfound to be of no avail, they were taken from the tower and thrust into\r\na hole into which the filth from the castle discharged itself. After\r\nsome months of this treatment several of them gave way; but the others\r\nremained firm, and were at last set free on condition of withdrawing\r\ninto Prussia.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of their imprisonment, Augusta, from his place\r\nof concealment, continually supplied them with money and letters of\r\nencouragement. But the organisers of the persecution were resolved, at\r\nall hazards, to make him their prisoner; and one of the most active of\r\nthem persuaded a leader of the Brotherhood to secure him a private\r\ninterview. Augusta had been taunted by some of the prisoners with\r\ntaking too much care for his own safety, and he therefore resolved to\r\nrisk the interview. Instead of the man who had appointed it, three\r\nothers appeared, who at once arrested Augusta and his secretary Bilek,\r\nand carried them off to the White Tower of Prague. Thence he was\r\nspeedily removed to a wine-cellar, where he was chained hand and foot.\r\nSoon after he was placed on the rack, and his side was burnt with\r\nboiling pitch. The Archduke Ferdinand himself doubted the legality\r\nof these proceedings; but the King was rigorous in the enforcement\r\nof his plans, and he wrote to his son suggesting further means of\r\ntorture. Augusta, he said, was not to be allowed a moment for rest or\r\nsleep; and, as one means for obtaining this end, an insect was to be\r\nfastened near him which would worry him continually; or, as another\r\nmeans of causing the same misery, he might be allowed food, but never\r\nanything to quench his thirst. But, before the letter containing these\r\nbarbarous instructions arrived, Augusta had been removed from Prague\r\nto Kr̆ivoklát, where he seems for a time to have fallen under a more\r\nhumane gaoler.\r\n\r\nNor was the persecution directed solely against a few leaders of the\r\nSociety. In the same month in which Augusta was arrested, a general\r\nEdict had been issued for the expulsion of the Brotherhood and the\r\narrest of their clergy. As they were ordered to leave Bohemia within\r\nsix weeks, the Brothers in Litomys̆l entreated that a longer time might\r\nbe allowed for the sake of the sick and of the women who were in\r\nlabour; and they pointed out that a similar relaxation had been granted\r\nin the case of the Jews and Anabaptists. This concession was, however,\r\nrefused; and the unfortunate people gathered together at Rychnov to\r\nmarch over the Silesian hills. But though the lords, who had formerly\r\nposed as patrons of the Brothers, now deserted their cause and joined\r\nin the persecution, help for the journey was, nevertheless, provided by\r\nthe richer members of the Society; and the members of the Brotherhood,\r\nwho lived in those Silesian towns through which the exiles passed,\r\nguided them securely through the dangers of the hills; nay, even many\r\nof the Utraquists and Catholics were so touched by their sufferings\r\nthat they joined in this assistance.\r\n\r\nAt last the procession entered Poland, and the Brothers settled for\r\na time in the town of Posen. But, though many of the Polish nobles\r\nwelcomed them heartily, the Bishop of Posen stirred up the King of\r\nPoland against them, and put them to such inconveniences, that many of\r\nthe Brotherhood accepted the invitation of the Elector of Brandenburg\r\nto settle in his newly conquered province of Prussia. Not even in\r\nPrussia, however, were the troubles of the exiles at an end. Mitmánek,\r\nthe Utraquist preacher who had been banished by Ferdinand, excited the\r\nsuspicions of the Elector of Brandenburg against the new-comers, and\r\neven assured him that the Confession which Augusta had taken to Luther\r\nwas not really the composition of the Brothers at all; but that, in\r\ntruth, they were Arians and Novatians. An inquiry was set on foot into\r\nthe real doctrines of the Brotherhood; and, though the decision of the\r\ninquisitors was mainly in favour of the Brothers, yet the restrictions\r\nplaced on them by the Elector were so galling, and the pressure upon\r\nthem to accept the Confession of Augsburg was so persistent, that many\r\npreferred to take their chance once more among their Slavonic kinsmen\r\nof Poland, rather than to accept the nominal protection of the Elector,\r\nwhen accompanied with so many practical inconveniences.\r\n\r\nFerdinand’s schemes, for the unification both of State and Church,\r\nseemed now ripe for further development. With regard to the question\r\nof civil government many difficulties had arisen during the Turkish\r\nwars, from the claims for local privileges put forward by various towns\r\nand districts of Bohemia. When Ferdinand had required money for the\r\npurposes of these wars, he had been forced to consider not merely the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Assemblies of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia,\r\nand the Lausitz, but also the peculiar privileges of the district of\r\nLoket, the miners’ rights in Joachims Thal and Kutna Hora, and, above\r\nall, the extremely anomalous position of the town and district of Eger\r\n(Cheb), which had claimed, ever since the fourteenth century, to be\r\nmore nearly connected with the German Empire than with the kingdom of\r\nBohemia. And even more embarrassing than any of these legal privileges\r\nwere the claims of the Assemblies of the Districts or Circles. These\r\nwere perhaps the most important check, which still existed, on the\r\npower of the king. As the nobles gradually sank into mere courtiers,\r\nand as the towns became, in many instances specially dependent upon\r\nthe King, that Order of Knights, which had played so important a part\r\nin the Utraquist struggles, found it more convenient to deliberate in\r\ntheir own districts, where they held an independent position, rather\r\nthan in Prague, where they might be outvoted by lords and citizens,\r\nand overruled by officers of the King. These meetings of the Circles\r\nwere gradually gaining a kind of legal authority; and, both in the\r\nTurkish and Saxon wars, they had formed an important check on the\r\naction of the Assembly at Prague, and had considerably hampered the\r\ndesigns of Ferdinand. They had even identified their interest at that\r\ntime with the provincial claims of Moravia and Silesia; and they had\r\nmaintained that an Assembly, composed only of those Bohemians who met\r\nat Prague, could not decide on so weighty a question as the war against\r\nJohn Frederick. Ferdinand, therefore, had come to look upon these\r\nAssemblies as his most dangerous opponents; and, though he could not at\r\nonce suppress them completely, he contrived to limit their powers and\r\ncontrol their actions.\r\n\r\nBut Ferdinand had a special device of his own for counteracting local\r\nindependence and increasing the royal power. This was the creation of\r\na Chamber of Finance, called in German “Hof-Kammer,” and in Bohemian\r\n“Komora Dvorska.” This institution was primarily introduced to meet\r\nthe difficulties of the King’s private income. During the reigns of\r\nLadislaus and Louis the royal lands had been heavily burdened with\r\ndebts; and Ferdinand’s relations with the lords, to whom these estates\r\nhad been mortgaged, had made it difficult for him to ascertain the\r\nexact state of the royal finances. The duty of the new Court was to\r\ninquire into the condition of the king’s Bohemian lands, and to base\r\nupon this inquiry an annual statement of his needs. This statement was\r\nto be followed by a demand from the various Assemblies of the exact\r\namount required. When this central Chamber of Finance was supplemented\r\nby other chambers of a similar kind in the different districts of\r\nBohemia, it was clear that an organisation had been formed which might\r\nbring considerable increase to the King’s power. The inquiry into the\r\ncondition of his finances would be accompanied by questions about the\r\ninclination of each Assembly to concede the money required; and thus\r\nquestions of taxation would be to a large extent settled before they\r\nhad been submitted to the lawful authority. Such a scheme, however,\r\ncould only come gradually into operation; and it was during the reigns\r\nof Ferdinand’s successors that the significance of the Hof-Kammer began\r\nto be realised. In the meantime the King did not forget to provide a\r\nmore immediate security for the stability of the House of Hapsburg;\r\nand, in 1549, the Bohemian Assembly was persuaded to accept Maximilian\r\nas the future King of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut the union of the Church was as much a part of Ferdinand’s scheme\r\nas the centralisation of the royal power; and Ferdinand supposed that\r\nsince the Catholics and Utraquists had united in persecuting the\r\nBrotherhood, they would have no objection to accept the same bishop\r\nas their spiritual ruler. But again he was mistaken. The Utraquists\r\nwere as determined as ever to assert their independence; and they\r\nresented extremely the attempt to bring them under the rule of the\r\nCatholic bishop. Indeed, so strong was the opposition which was roused\r\nby this proposal, that many of the Utraquists began to repent of their\r\npersecution of the Brotherhood, and even to show signs of sympathy with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFerdinand at once sprang to the conclusion that a new plot was on foot;\r\nand, with a suspiciousness little short of insane, he assumed that\r\nAugusta must be at the bottom of it. The torturers were sent down to\r\nthe prison at Kr̆ivoklát; and both Augusta and his secretary were again\r\nstretched upon the rack. But, when no conspiracy was discovered by this\r\nmethod, Ferdinand had to look elsewhere for the source of opposition to\r\nhis wishes; and it was now for the first time that he became conscious\r\nof a weak point in his plans, which till then he had strangely\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, when Ladislaus was trying to coerce the\r\nBrotherhood, he had failed to obtain from the Moravian Estates that\r\nassent to his wishes which the Bohemians had been willing to grant.\r\nThe consequence was that, while Ferdinand had been so successful in\r\nexpelling the Brotherhood from his western province, the members of\r\nthat society had still met undisturbed in the province of Moravia. A\r\nspecial circumstance had induced Ferdinand, for the time, to overlook\r\nthis evasion of his commands. Wenceslaus of Ludanic, the Captain of\r\nMoravia, had been a member of the Brotherhood; but he had strongly\r\nopposed the revolt of 1547, had prevented the Moravians from joining in\r\nit, and had even rebuked Augusta for not opposing it more actively.\r\nDoubtless the loyalty of so influential a Brother had had for a short\r\ntime its effect on Ferdinand. But the growing opposition which he\r\nencountered amongst the Utraquists, and his increasing fears of the\r\nBrotherhood, now led him to abandon this policy of compromise. He\r\ncalled together the Moravian Assembly at Brünn (Brno); and he ordered\r\nthem, and especially their Captain, to take steps for the immediate\r\nsuppression of the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nLudanic answered by entreating Ferdinand not to put down those who had\r\nattained to the knowledge of the purified Gospel; and he assured the\r\nKing that Moravia would sooner perish in fire and ashes than submit\r\nto violence in this matter. He then appealed to the members of the\r\nAssembly; and the main body of them confirmed his words in a loud\r\nvoice. Ferdinand then asked if any, there present, were ready to obey\r\nhim. Only seven members of the Assembly responded to this appeal--five\r\nof them lords and two knights. Then Ludanic once more rose, and read to\r\nFerdinand the oath which the King had taken, as Margrave of Moravia, to\r\ndefend the liberties of that province. Ferdinand indignantly answered\r\nthat he had kept his oath, and intended to keep it; upon which Ludanic\r\nexplained that he had not accused the King of having _yet_ broken his\r\noath; but that he had read it to him as a reminder for future use.\r\nUnable to accomplish his ends, Ferdinand was at last obliged to dismiss\r\nthe Assembly, and to retire to his house. But, when he looked from his\r\nwindow a little later, he saw the members of the Assembly carrying\r\nLudanic home in triumph. Thus, while crushed out in the province of\r\nBohemia, the Bohemian Brotherhood grew and flourished in Moravia.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the Brothers were enabled to renew their\r\ncorrespondence with Augusta, by the help of one of his gaolers whom\r\nthey had succeeded in bribing. Unfortunately, this correspondence did\r\nnot strengthen the friendly relations between the prisoner and the\r\nElders of the Society. Always of a rather imperious disposition, and\r\nnow embittered by his sufferings, Augusta attempted to assert his\r\nauthority in a way which the Elders often resented. Indeed, they had\r\nbegun to think that the exclusion of Augusta from the outer world\r\ndisqualified him for his office as Elder of the Brotherhood. They\r\nconsented indeed, in deference to his earnest appeals, to retain\r\nhim a little longer in his former dignity; and at one time there\r\nseemed a hope that this painful dispute might end in the release\r\nof the imprisoned Brother, and his return to his former life. The\r\nsecond treachery of Moritz of Saxony had overthrown the hopes of the\r\nImperialists; the treaty of Passau had raised anew the Protestant\r\nexpectations of religious liberty; and in 1552 the Catholic and\r\nProtestant leaders of the Moravian Assembly united in such an earnest\r\nappeal for mercy to Ferdinand, that he consented to consider the\r\nquestion of the release of his Protestant prisoners.\r\n\r\nBut once more the tide turned against the unfortunate Augusta. In\r\nFebruary, 1553, his correspondence with the Brotherhood was suddenly\r\ndiscovered. Again Ferdinand was seized with an attack of his\r\nconspiracy-mania; Augusta and Bilek were once more hurried off to\r\nPrague, and chained together in the White Tower. When no treasonable\r\nsense could by any means be extorted from their letters, they were\r\nallowed to return to their prison in Kr̆ivoklát; but all further\r\ncorrespondence with the outer world was forbidden; and the Elders of\r\nthe Brotherhood, having heard that Augusta had been put to death,\r\nelected a new Elder in his place.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the hopes which had been raised by the treaty of Passau\r\nwere considerably strengthened at this time, by the rumour, which was\r\nrapidly gaining ground, that Maximilian, the future king of Bohemia,\r\nwas opposed to the policy of his father. Ernest of Krajek, a member of\r\nthat family which had already offered such opposition to Ladislaus and\r\nFerdinand, eagerly welcomed back the Brothers to their old quarters\r\nat Mláda Boleslav; and at the same time he despatched a messenger to\r\nVienna, to make sure of the sympathies of Maximilian. This messenger\r\nwas John Blahoslav, a writer and artist, who was afterwards to attain\r\nsome celebrity as an historian of the Brotherhood. When he arrived at\r\nVienna he found Maximilian in active sympathy with the Lutherans; and\r\nhe received much encouragement for the Brotherhood from the preacher\r\nwho had most influence with the prince.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, however, Blahoslav soon discovered that a new power\r\nhad sprung up in Europe, more dangerous to the hopes of the Protestants\r\nthan any kings or generals. This was the Order of the Jesuits, who\r\nhad recently settled in Vienna, and who had gained great influence\r\nover the mind of Ferdinand. That powerful body had soon directed their\r\nattention to Bohemia; and, a few years after Blahoslav’s visit to\r\nVienna, they secured a settlement in Prague. Even before that time, the\r\npersecution of the Brotherhood had again been renewed. The death of\r\nErnest of Krajek gave Ferdinand an opportunity for venting his hatred\r\non the sons of his late opponent; and they were forced, after a vain\r\nopposition, to close those meeting-houses of the Brotherhood which\r\ntheir father had re-opened. Blahoslav and other influential Brothers\r\nwere once more forced to hide themselves; and many Protestants, who had\r\nbeen favourable to them, were gradually persuaded to desert their cause.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it was during this period of persecution that the\r\nrelations between Augusta and the Brotherhood became once more severely\r\nstrained. He had succeeded in finding another messenger, through whom\r\nhe re-opened the correspondence with his colleagues; and he sent the\r\nElders some Commentaries which he had just written upon the Gospels.\r\nThese he begged them to use as part of the teaching of the Brotherhood.\r\nThe Elders answered that they had no time properly to examine the\r\nbook; and the bitterness caused by this ungracious answer was further\r\nincreased by their subsequent publication of the book in a somewhat\r\naltered form. In addition to these causes of disagreement, Augusta now\r\nheard, for the first time, of his deposition from the office of Elder;\r\nand, when he remonstrated with the Brotherhood on the subject, they\r\nrefused to reconsider their decision.\r\n\r\nWhether Ferdinand heard of this controversy or not, something prompted\r\nhim at this time to renew his efforts for the conversion of Augusta;\r\nand he offered to release him on condition of his joining either the\r\nCatholics or the Utraquists. To the first of these proposals Augusta\r\nreturned an unhesitating refusal; to the suggestion of a reunion with\r\nthe Utraquists he gave at first a more evasive answer. When, indeed,\r\nhe was asked for a more definite statement, he drew up a declaration\r\nof his firm adherence to the Brotherhood; but an unexpected event\r\nprevented him from sending off this declaration, and brought about\r\na change in his position, which was ultimately to produce the most\r\npainful results.\r\n\r\nPhillippina, the beautiful wife of the Archduke Ferdinand, was anxious\r\nto act as a moderating influence in the counsels of the family. She\r\nvisited Augusta in prison, and expressed a wish to serve him. He\r\neagerly asked that he and Bilek might be allowed to spend Easter with\r\ntheir friends; and he mentioned that they had been now about twelve\r\nyears in prison, and that he had not seen Bilek for eight years.\r\nPhillippina succeeded in persuading King Ferdinand to yield to this\r\nproposal; and both she and her husband hoped that, by this means, they\r\nmight pave the way for Augusta’s conversion to the Catholic Faith.\r\nWith this view, after his Easter visit was over, he was sent to a\r\nJesuit convent in Prague. There, while well treated in other respects,\r\nhe was not allowed to see any one but the chiefs of the Order; and\r\nthey carried on daily theological arguments with him. Their first\r\npropositions they managed to state in so colourless a form, that\r\nhe was forced to agree to them; but, when they raised the question\r\nof the possibility of error in the Church, they found that they and\r\ntheir intended disciple were hopelessly at variance. Finding that the\r\nCatholics had failed, the Utraquists now summoned him before their\r\nConsistory, and tried to persuade him to join their organisation. At\r\nfirst he absolutely resisted their attempts; but he consented at last\r\nto use expressions, which were afterwards strangely perverted by some\r\nof his opponents. He admitted that “he belonged to the Utraquistic\r\nBohemian Church, and that he agreed with them in all those essential\r\ndoctrines which they had derived from Scripture.” These expressions\r\nwere, very likely, a greater concession to the Utraquists than he\r\nwould have made at a previous time; but it is abundantly clear, from\r\nhis subsequent action, that he did not intend his words to imply the\r\nabandonment of any doctrine which he had formerly held. Nor did the\r\nauthorities so consider them; for, though Bilek was shortly afterwards\r\nset free, Augusta was sent back to his prison at Kr̆ivoklát.\r\n\r\nBut the Elders of the Brotherhood chose to treat these utterances\r\nas a complete abandonment of their cause; and they wrote a fierce\r\nand taunting letter to Augusta, in which they accused him of first\r\nattempting to exercise Papal power over the Brotherhood, and then\r\nabandoning them in order to obtain his release. Even this injustice\r\ndid not drive Augusta to abandon his convictions. When, two years\r\nlater, he was again required to make submission to the Utraquists, he\r\nrefused to admit that he had held any heretical doctrines; nor would\r\nhe accept the Utraquistic view of the Sacraments; and, in 1563, he\r\nexplicitly declared that he believed the teaching of the Brotherhood to\r\nbe nearer to Holy Scripture than that of either the Lutherans or the\r\nUtraquists. But the release, which he would not obtain by concession,\r\nwas shortly to be granted to him gratuitously. In the year following\r\nthis declaration, Ferdinand felt that his end was approaching; and, as\r\nif seized with remorse for his injustice, he consented to set Augusta\r\nfree, without any further conditions. A few months later the king\r\ndied; and the accession of Maximilian produced a further change in the\r\nfortunes of Bohemia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nFROM THE DEATH OF FERDINAND I. TO THE BEGINNING OF THE REACTION UNDER\r\nRUDOLF II.\r\n\r\n(1564-1600.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn describing a struggle between two rival powers in a State, it is\r\nextremely difficult to give a correct impression of the exact balance\r\nof success on either side at a particular crisis in the controversy;\r\nand this difficulty is enormously increased when the struggle is\r\nconcerned partly with the question of spiritual (and therefore mainly\r\nindividual) liberty; and partly with the growth of those more material\r\nforms of centralisation which check constitutional freedom and local\r\nself-government. When we hear of Ferdinand yielding on his deathbed\r\nto the prisoner whom he had been trying for so many years to crush\r\ninto obedience, we feel that the victory lies, in the main, with those\r\nspiritual forces which were working against ecclesiastical uniformity.\r\nNor does the resistance of the Moravian Estates seem less important as\r\na victory of constitutional freedom, than the firmness of Augusta as a\r\nsecurity for spiritual independence.\r\n\r\nBut the real importance of such episodes as these lies in the contrast\r\nwhich they offer to the main tendencies of Bohemian history during\r\nthe sixteenth century; and the proof which they consequently give of\r\nthe survival of forces which seem elsewhere to be crushed out. For\r\ncentralisation was, after all, steadily growing in the dominions of\r\nFerdinand; and national life, however it might struggle for existence,\r\nwas being sapped by arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget that there was one moral consideration which worked\r\non the side of Ferdinand. The terrible danger to which Europe was\r\nexposed by the Turkish invader was not really removed until the latter\r\npart of the seventeenth century; and even Vienna itself was to be once\r\nmore endangered, before the barbarian could be induced to settle down\r\npeaceably beside his neighbours, and confine himself to the oppression\r\nof his Christian subjects. When, therefore, Ferdinand found that the\r\nlocal assemblies of the different provinces grudged him their help in\r\nthis important struggle, and that even at Prague he had difficulty\r\nin obtaining both money and soldiers, it was not unnatural that he\r\nshould feel a growing indifference to liberties which seemed to him so\r\ndangerous to the peace and order of Europe.\r\n\r\nSo when in 1555 he had summoned representatives from all his dominions\r\nto meet at Vienna, to devise a common scheme of action against the\r\nTurk, he must have bitterly resented the absence of the Bohemians, who\r\nrefused to attend an Assembly where they might be swamped by Germans\r\nand Hungarians. An even more fatal point of opposition between the\r\nNational desire for peace and independence, and the Imperial scheme\r\nfor the defence of Europe, was found in the question of military\r\norganisation. The old privilege of the Bohemians, to refuse their\r\nservices for foreign wars, was continually insisted on by them in\r\nopposition to Ferdinand; and he was almost unavoidably compelled to\r\nraise armies which should be independent of national sentiment, and to\r\ngarrison the frontier towns of Moravia with soldiers drawn from all\r\nparts of his dominions.\r\n\r\nNor, while he was so successful in his schemes of State centralisation,\r\nwas Ferdinand wholly worsted in his struggle for ecclesiastical unity.\r\nOne victory at least he gained; and by a curious irony of fortune,\r\nhe won it by granting a concession which had once been most ardently\r\ndesired by the Bohemian leaders, but which had now, by change of\r\ncircumstances, become worse than useless. Just at the close of the\r\nCouncil of Trent, he succeeded in obtaining from the Pope a formal\r\nconcession to the Bohemians of their right to grant the Cup to the\r\nlaity. Thus the old watchword of the Hussite wars, separated from\r\nall that had given it life and force, now became a step towards\r\nthe absorption of the Utraquists by the Catholics. When once this\r\nconcession was granted, Ferdinand insisted that the Utraquists could no\r\nlonger refuse to accept the authority of the Roman Catholic Archbishop.\r\nFrom this time forward, Utraquism ceases to be a force in Bohemian\r\nhistory. Their separate Consistory was indeed revived by Maximilian;\r\nand from time to time the members of it continued to assert themselves\r\nin the religious controversies of the day; but every such effort\r\ntended more and more plainly to show that the champions of the old\r\nfaith were but the impotent and unworthy representatives of traditions\r\nof former greatness. With the death of Ferdinand, all these questions\r\nenter on a new phase. The strength and weakness of the late king’s\r\nideals were to be put to new tests during the reign of his son.\r\n\r\nMaximilian is one of those men who seem to the careful student of\r\nhistory all the more pathetic, because their failures are not of that\r\nstriking and dramatic kind which at once excite the sympathy of the\r\nobserver; but are rather gathered from a careful comparison of the\r\nobjects aimed at with those actually accomplished. Hampered by the\r\ncontinual distrust and the domineering influence of his father, half\r\ninclined to the extremer doctrines of Protestantism, and yet never\r\nable to shake off the recollection that he was the heir of a Catholic\r\ntradition; angry with the Jesuits for their intriguing interference\r\nwith his affairs, and no less angry with the Protestants for those\r\ndivisions which prevented a completely artistic settlement of the\r\necclesiastical question; anxious to recognise the local and other\r\nliberties of his Bohemian subjects, but conscious of the difficulties\r\nwhich those liberties placed in the way of the struggle against the\r\nTurk, Maximilian was continually drifting backwards and forwards in a\r\nway which tended to weaken the system of government which his father\r\nhad tried to establish, without substituting anything freer or more\r\nnational in its place.\r\n\r\nNor must we forget that Maximilian had to deal with the same\r\ninsoluble problem for which Charles IV. had only provided a temporary\r\nsolution. Ferdinand had reigned for nearly thirty years as King of\r\nBohemia, before he had been forced to assume the burden of the German\r\nEmpire. Maximilian had to take up both these responsibilities at\r\nthe same time; and, apart from the enormous intellectual and moral\r\ndifference between Maximilian of Austria and Charles of Luxemburg, the\r\nproblem with which the later Emperor had to deal was infinitely more\r\ncomplicated than any which presented itself to the statesmen of the\r\nfourteenth century. The difference between Protestant and Catholic\r\nwas in itself enough to introduce years of division and war into the\r\nEmpire; but that element of confusion was now trebly increased by the\r\nnew sects into which Lutheranism had been divided, and by the still\r\nkeener political divisions between the Lutherans and Calvinists. In\r\nBohemia, again, the same difficulties presented themselves in an even\r\nmore complicated form; for, while many of the Bohemian Reformers had\r\nidentified their cause with that of the Lutherans, the old feeling\r\nof national distinction was driving many into opposition to the\r\naggressive character of the German movement, and compelling them to\r\nseek for a new religious centre which should be neither Papal nor\r\nGerman. As the Utraquists could no longer supply such a centre, the\r\nchampionship of Bohemian feeling rapidly passed to the leaders of\r\nthe Bohemian Brotherhood. The great defender of the national and\r\ndistinctive position of the Brotherhood, against the encroachments of\r\nthe Lutherans, was that Blahoslav who had already become prominent\r\nas a negotiator with foreign Protestants, and who was ultimately to\r\nbecome the historian of the Brotherhood. He had already vindicated\r\nthe specially Bohemian character of the Brotherhood against a critic\r\nwho had tried to identify them with the Franco-Italian sect of the\r\nWaldenses; and so keen had Blahoslav and his friends been in the\r\nassertion of their national position, that they had been willing\r\nsometimes to speak of themselves as “the remains of the Taborites,”\r\nchoosing rather to identify their cause with a Bohemian sect so\r\ndifferent from them both in spirit and doctrine, than with a French or\r\nItalian community, however like them in every respect but race.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, the Lutherans demanded that the Bohemian Brothers should\r\naccept the Augsburg Confession, and practically consent to absorption\r\nin the Lutheran body, Blahoslav and his friends resolved to offer a\r\nsteady resistance to this proposal. Unfortunately, Blahoslav was forced\r\nto encounter, in this controversy, the most distinguished member of his\r\nown community. John Augusta, after his release from prison, had been\r\nwelcomed back to his friends by the main body of the Brotherhood; but\r\nhe soon found that the power which he desired to exercise over them\r\nwas still resisted and resented. He proposed that, instead of the free\r\nexercise of preaching in the Brotherhood, certain definite parts of the\r\ngospel should be chosen for exposition each Sunday in the year; and he\r\nhimself drew up a plan on which these discourses should be founded.\r\nSome of the Brothers objected that the doctrines suggested in his book\r\nwere not altogether those held by the Brothers; while, no doubt, a\r\nstill larger number resented the restrictions which such an arrangement\r\nwould impose on the preachers. Irritated at the general opposition\r\noffered to his proposals, Augusta came to the conclusion that the\r\nBrotherhood was in a radically unsatisfactory condition; and he threw\r\nhimself into the movement for union with the Lutherans, as a means of\r\nreform. So bitter was the opposition which he roused by this conduct,\r\nthat he became entirely separated from the rest of the Brotherhood;\r\nand, when he died in 1572, his death passed almost unnoticed by those\r\nfor whom he had done and suffered so much.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Maximilian was endeavouring to take up a neutral\r\nposition in this controversy. Personally in sympathy with the Brothers,\r\nbut afraid of offending Catholics and Lutherans, he continually assured\r\nall parties that he was unable to assent to any legal sanction for\r\nreligious liberty, since he had bound himself to oppose novelties; but\r\nthat, if they would only settle their differences between themselves,\r\nnobody would interfere with the performance of their religion. Even\r\nthis statement was more definite and consistent than his actual\r\npractice; for, when the Catholic or Utraquist priests applied to him\r\nfor powers to suppress novelties or heresies, he assented to their\r\nproposals, though, when either Brothers or Lutherans complained to him,\r\nhe assured them of his personal sympathy for them, and his desire to\r\nleave them untouched.\r\n\r\nHis great hope for the solution of these difficulties seems to have\r\nlain in some scheme of union among Protestants. If only the Lutheran\r\nsects, Bohemian Brothers, and Calvinists would give up their quarrels\r\nwith one another, religious toleration would become such an easy\r\naffair. He therefore sympathised particularly with the new proposal,\r\nwhich was gradually shaping itself in the discussions between the\r\nLutherans and the Brothers. This was a plan for a new Bohemian creed,\r\nto be drawn up at a combined meeting of the various sects. The Brothers\r\nlooked upon this movement with great suspicion. They saw in it an\r\nattempt of the Lutherans to secure the acceptance of the Augsburg\r\nConfession by indirect means; and they noted their persistent attempts\r\nto exclude the Brothers from those Assemblies where ecclesiastical\r\nquestions were discussed. Nevertheless, when Maximilian, on his return\r\nto Bohemia in 1575, consented to preside at the Assembly in which this\r\nnew creed was to be proposed, the Brothers were willing to take part in\r\nthe discussion. Doctor Crato, Maximilian’s physician, secretly urged\r\nthe Brothers to stand firm, assuring them that the Emperor was really\r\nin sympathy with them. Encouraged by this hint, they not only resisted\r\na motion for the acceptance of the Augsburg Confession, but they even\r\nobjected to the appointment of a committee for the preparation of\r\nformulæ which were to unite all parties.\r\n\r\nThe committee was, nevertheless, appointed, and its actions soon\r\njustified the fears of the Brothers. In the introduction to the\r\nproposed creed, the committee pronounced an anathema against a number\r\nof heretics, and, amongst others, against all Calvinists. Now many of\r\nthe Brothers had embraced Calvinistic doctrines; and their friendship\r\nwith the champions of those doctrines had been strengthened by motives,\r\nboth of personal resentment and of moral sympathy. The treatment of\r\nthe exiled Brothers by the Lutherans of Prussia had repelled the\r\nBrotherhood generally from the creed of their unfriendly hosts; while\r\nthe strict moral discipline maintained in the Calvinistic University of\r\nHeidelberg was more attractive to the followers of Peter of Chelc̆ic\r\nthan the growing laxity of Wittenberg. They therefore offered a\r\nsuccessful opposition to that sweeping condemnation of Calvinism to\r\nwhich the Lutherans desired to commit them. But this was, after all,\r\nbut a minor point in the objections of the Brothers to the proposed\r\ncreed. Apart from every detail, the proposal to surrender their own\r\nConfession in favour of any new form of words whatsoever, was wholly\r\ninconsistent with the position which they desired to maintain. They\r\ntherefore offered such steady resistance to the proposed Confession,\r\nthat they at last induced the Lutherans to consent to a petition to\r\nthe King and the Assembly asking them to recognise each sect as a\r\nseparate organisation. This result, however, was not reached till the\r\ncontroversy had become so fierce that the rival theologians came to\r\nblows in the streets.\r\n\r\nMaximilian was heartily disgusted with the whole proceeding. He saw his\r\nhope of union among the Bohemian Protestants annihilated. He felt that\r\nhe had injured his position with the Catholics by the concessions which\r\nhe had already made; and he was further irritated that the Assembly\r\nshould waste its time in these theological discussions, when he was\r\nwanting it to consider the acceptance of his son Rudolf as the future\r\nking of Bohemia, and to vote money for the Turkish war. He laid the\r\nchief blame of these failures upon the Brothers, who had resisted the\r\nnew Confession, and on the towns, which had always made difficulties\r\nabout the Turkish vote; and he sent down orders to the governors to\r\nsuppress the meetings of the Brotherhood, and to forbid the towns to\r\nintroduce any novelties. He even went so far as to order prosecutions\r\nof various Brothers for having attended meetings forbidden by the law;\r\nbut, before these prosecutions could be carried out, this new policy\r\nwas suddenly cut short by the death of Maximilian in 1576.\r\n\r\nFew kings had more thoroughly disappointed the expectations formed of\r\nthem than Maximilian II. had done; but, in a different way, his son\r\nRudolf was to disappoint the hopes of the Catholics as completely as\r\nhis father had done those of the Protestants. Brought up in Spain, and\r\nbelieved to be a strict Catholic in convictions, shy and repellent in\r\nmanner, he seemed exactly the man to revive the reactionary policy of\r\nhis grandfather. But in Rudolf, as in the majority of men, temperament\r\nand taste had a greater influence over his actions than either\r\nreligious or political convictions. The same feelings which made him\r\nso repellent in general intercourse, led him also to shrink from the\r\nburdens of public life; and his fondness for art and science led him in\r\nthe earlier part of his reign to leave politics to men of more active\r\ncharacter. The interest, therefore, of this part of Rudolf’s reign, so\r\nfar as his own influence is concerned, centres rather in the revival of\r\nliterature and art, than in political or religious controversy. This\r\nrevival was of a varied character, for it included not only poetry and\r\nhistory, but every kind of art and science. Carving, statuary, and\r\nmosaic work were brought to great perfection: while the presence of\r\nTycho Brahe at Court shows the interest which Rudolf always maintained\r\nin astronomical science. The preference of the new Emperor for Prague\r\nas a place of residence naturally attracted all this brilliant company\r\nto the Bohemian Court; and it seemed as if, in this respect, the age of\r\nCharles IV. were to return.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it should be noted that this revival, though\r\ngenerally connected with the name of Rudolf, had been already growing\r\nsince the accession of Ferdinand. The greater security for life and\r\nproperty, which was gradually introduced by the House of Austria,\r\nhad given more opportunity for quiet study than had been possible in\r\nthe turbulent Bohemia of the fifteenth century; while the greater\r\nintercourse with foreign countries, which the renewed connection with\r\nthe Empire had produced, naturally attracted a large number of foreign\r\ncelebrities to the Court of Prague.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Ferdinand had been marked by the works of two most\r\npicturesque though untrustworthy historians--Wenceslaus Hajek of\r\nLibocany, and Dubravsky, better known as Dubravius, the Bishop of\r\nOlmütz; while Matthæus Collinus of Choterina called out an interest\r\nin the study of the great Greek and Latin authors, who had till then\r\nbeen rather neglected. The interest felt by Maximilian and Rudolf in\r\nthe revival of poetry was much keener than that of Ferdinand; though\r\nthey both, doubtless, stunted more than one poetical intellect by the\r\nabsurd practice of turning poets into nobles, and crowning them as\r\nCourt Laureates. A more curious result of this revival, considering the\r\norigin and sympathies of the ruling House, was the steady development\r\nof the Bohemian language during this period. Dictionaries and other\r\nscientific works were produced; and Daniel Adam, who was Professor of\r\nHistory at Prague in the time of Maximilian, was said to have done\r\nmuch to bring the language to great perfection. Nor did Maximilian and\r\nRudolf fail to encourage scientific discovery. Thaddæus Hajek, who had\r\nstudied, not only at Prague, but also at Vienna and Bologna, actually\r\ndiscovered a new star in 1572; and he showed himself so far in advance\r\nof his age, that he used his learning to expose and ridicule the\r\nastrological speculations which were then so popular.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected, perhaps, that all this stirring of thought and\r\nlife would be favourable to the revival of civic and religious liberty;\r\nand some of the men who were eminent in the literature and art of the\r\ntime did take an active part in the struggles at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. But a power had arisen in Bohemia, which continued\r\nsteadily to gain ground during the reign of Rudolf, that could turn\r\neven literature and art into the cause of opposition to reform. This\r\nwas the Order of the Jesuits, which, since the time of Ferdinand, had\r\nbeen steadily gaining ground in Bohemia. They eagerly seized upon\r\nthe literary and artistic revival, and made use of it for their own\r\npurposes. George Bartold Pontanus, one of the poets who were crowned\r\nby Rudolf, fell into the hands of the Jesuits, and became one of their\r\nmost eloquent preachers. William of Rosenberg, who was a great patron\r\nof the Order, founded an institution for poor scholars, which must have\r\ngreatly forwarded the Catholic reaction. Even students of languages,\r\nand men engaged in foreign discoveries, were made use of by the Order.\r\nMoreover their great power then, as ever, was through the education of\r\nchildren. Many of these came from the poorest ranks, and were educated\r\ngratuitously by the Jesuits; and, through them, an influence was\r\nprepared which it was very difficult to resist. But the Jesuits were\r\nintended by Ignatius Loyola to be, before everything, a fighting body;\r\nand, as they looked round on the forces opposed to them in Bohemia,\r\nthey speedily marked the Bohemian Brotherhood as the foemen most worthy\r\nof their steel.\r\n\r\nThe Utraquists, as already mentioned, had been reduced almost to\r\nimpotence in the time of Ferdinand. The Lutherans, divided among\r\nthemselves, weak in organisation, and without any hold on the feeling\r\nof Bohemia, were almost equally an object of contempt to the Jesuits;\r\nbut in the Brotherhood they saw a power of organisation, a capacity for\r\nintense self-devotion, and great educational faculties, which made them\r\ndangerous rivals even to the followers of Loyola. Just at this time the\r\nBrothers had taken a step which, while infinitely to their own credit,\r\nhad yet raised up against them enemies whom the Jesuits could easily\r\ncall in as their allies. The Brotherhood, as already hinted, had found,\r\neven more than most religious communities, a perpetual difficulty in\r\nsolving that painful problem of the proper relation of the Church to\r\nthe World; for, while they would never consent to drift tamely into the\r\nconventional morality of a comfortable and generally accepted Church,\r\nthey were yet continually forced to make concessions to the prejudices\r\nof the world around them, which endangered the spiritual life of their\r\ncommunity. Their concessions in the matter of war had, as we have seen,\r\ndriven from their ranks some of the stricter members of the Society at\r\na very early stage of their history; and a difficulty which was an even\r\ngreater vexation to the minds of the Brothers, was the relation between\r\nthe Community and the nobles.\r\n\r\nThe original conception of the Brotherhood, as a Society of equals\r\nworking in the main with their hands for their livelihood, had never\r\nbeen wholly lost sight of; and the clergy were still expected to\r\nsupport themselves largely by their own handiwork. But the necessity\r\nfor protection against the continual outbursts of persecution from\r\nother sects had compelled the Brothers to accept the patronage of\r\ncertain lords who were inclined to their doctrines. The most zealous\r\nof these noblemen desired a closer union with the Brotherhood than\r\nthe position of outside patron could give them; and yet they were by\r\nno means willing to make that surrender of their rank and position\r\nwhich the rules of the Brotherhood required. The Brothers had not\r\nseen their way to exclude these aristocratic members from an entrance\r\ninto the Community; and the difficulties of the position naturally\r\nincreased, when the son or grandson of some zealous nobleman accepted\r\nthe hereditary connection with the Brotherhood without any of the moral\r\nenthusiasm which had led his ancestor to join it. The opposition which\r\nthe plebeian preachers of the Brotherhood encountered in their attempts\r\nto exercise a spiritual control over these aristocratic followers\r\nwas of course specially great in a century when even champions of\r\nreligious liberty claimed the right to dictate their creed to their\r\ntenants and dependants. Serfdom, it cannot too often be remembered, had\r\ngained a new footing in Bohemia at the close of the fifteenth century;\r\nand Krajek, in his championship of so eminent a Brother as Augusta,\r\nhad insisted much on his right, as a feudal landlord, to protect\r\nhis dependant against the King. In such a condition of society, it\r\nought not to surprise us that the leaders of the Brotherhood may have\r\nsometimes seemed to wink at offences in the nobles which they condemned\r\nseverely in their more plebeian members.\r\n\r\nBut there was a recuperative force in this Community which showed\r\nitself continually at critical moments, and, in 1578, the Bohemian\r\nnobility were startled by the news that the Brothers had expelled from\r\ntheir Society, for acts of immorality, two members of that very family\r\nof Krajek who had been the steadiest patrons of the Brotherhood. A\r\nfierce outburst of indignation and scorn followed; and the Bohemian\r\nnobles asked how “Chlapi” (serfs), like the leaders of the Brotherhood,\r\ncould venture to deal thus with the members of a noble family? Nor was\r\nit only the protest of the nobles which showed how far the ideal of\r\nthe Brothers transcended that of the rest of the Community. A Lutheran\r\ncongregation at once invited one of the expelled Brothers to join their\r\nbody, and urged upon him that such a step would be a fit revenge on the\r\nungrateful Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits saw their opportunity in the sudden unpopularity of the\r\nBrotherhood; and they pressed upon several of the nobles to expel these\r\nrevolutionary heretics from their estates. The Chancellor, Vratislav of\r\nPernstein, was one of those to whom the Jesuits made special advances;\r\nand they were able to influence him not only through his prejudices\r\nas a nobleman, but through his affection as a husband. Pernstein,\r\nlike so many of the Bohemian nobles since their country had passed\r\nunder the rule of the Hapsburgs, had married a Spanish lady; and these\r\nwives were, as a rule, zealous champions and obedient pupils of the\r\nJesuits. Frau von Pernstein had a special influence, not only over her\r\nhusband, but over many of the younger Bohemian women; and, with her\r\nhelp, the Jesuits succeeded in making many converts, even in that town\r\nof Litomys̆l where Augusta had once had so much influence. Both there\r\nand on other parts of the estate Pernstein now proceeded to close the\r\nmeeting-houses of the Brothers, and he opened a Jesuit college on the\r\nsite of their former labours. Adam of Neuhaus and William of Rosenberg\r\ncarried out the same policy on their estates, and many other nobles\r\nfollowed their example. The Bishop of Olmütz, Stanislaus Pavlavsky, now\r\nhoped to rouse Rudolf to give active assistance to this movement. At\r\nthe bishop’s request, the Emperor issued an order that no book should\r\nbe sold in Moravia without Pavlavsky’s special permission; and, in\r\norder to secure the practical working of this prohibition, he decreed\r\nthat not more than two printing-presses should be allowed at Olmütz.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a blow was aimed at the Brotherhood in a still more\r\nimportant part of their work. Ezrom Rüdiger, a leading Brother, had\r\nopened a school at Ivanc̆ic̆e, which had gained so high a reputation\r\nthat men of other denominations sent their children to be taught by\r\nRüdiger, and the managers of a rival Lutheran school in the city of\r\nVelké Mezir̆íc̆í attempted to decoy Rüdiger away by the offering of\r\na higher salary. Of course these bribes had failed of their effect,\r\nand a decree had been obtained by the Jesuits for the closing of both\r\nthese schools. This order, however, had been disregarded; and Rüdiger\r\nhad gained further reputation by defending the Brotherhood against the\r\nattacks of the leader of another sect. This controversy, however, gave\r\na handle to the Bishop of Olmütz, and he denounced both Rüdiger and his\r\nopponent to Rudolf as disturbers of the peace. A warrant was sent down\r\nfor the arrest of Rüdiger, and about the same time Herr von Pernstein\r\nimprisoned two of the Brothers on his own Moravian estates.\r\n\r\nBut now, as in the time of Ferdinand, attempts at persecution, which\r\nhad succeeded in Bohemia, broke down before the opposition of the\r\nMoravian Estates. At the meeting of the Moravian Assembly, the Bishop\r\nof Olmütz was so roughly treated by his colleagues, that he left\r\nBrünn before the meeting was over. The two clergy on the Pernstein\r\nlands were released. Rüdiger, who had taken refuge with Frederick of\r\nZ̆erotin, was allowed to submit his case to the Moravian Estates; and\r\nthe Assembly not only disregarded the Edict about the books and the\r\nprinting, but passed a vote of censure on those who had made attacks\r\non the Brotherhood. This and other failures soon persuaded the leaders\r\nof the Catholic reaction that they had little hope of support from\r\nthe Emperor; and the Jesuits were forced to carry on their struggles\r\nthrough the help of individual noblemen.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1592, even this form of propagandism encountered an unexpected\r\nobstacle. In that year William of Rosenberg died, and his nephew,\r\nPeter Vok von Rosenberg, succeeded to the estates. He had gained some\r\ndistinction as a soldier under Ferdinand and Maximilian; but soon after\r\nMaximilian’s death he had married Caterina of Ludanic, a member of the\r\nfamily of that Wenceslaus of Ludanic who had defended the rights of the\r\nBrotherhood and the liberties of Moravia against Ferdinand. Under her\r\ninfluence Peter Vok rapidly drifted to Calvinism; and in 1582 he had\r\nformally joined the Brotherhood. On coming into his estates he soon\r\ngave signs of his change of creed; and, as a first step, he so harassed\r\nthe Jesuits of the college which his uncle had founded at Krumov, that\r\nthey left that town and fled to Neuhaus. About the same time, George\r\nof Lobkovic, another champion of the Jesuits, was deprived of his\r\noffice by Rudolf for fraudulent use of his power; and, his estates\r\nbeing forfeited to the Crown, Rudolf handed them over to a man whom he\r\nsupposed to be a zealous Catholic, but who soon proved to be a friend\r\nand favourer of the Lutherans. Thus, then, a general struggle was going\r\non throughout Bohemia, which, from the apparent indifference of the\r\nEmperor, was tending more and more to loosen the bonds of the central\r\ngovernment, and was in many cases leading to open acts of violence\r\nand disorder. But, just as the sixteenth century was closing on this\r\ncondition of things, a series of events occurred which roused the\r\nEmperor from his lethargy, and produced a complete change in the course\r\nof Bohemian history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BEGINNING OF THE REACTION TO THE DEATH OF RUDOLF II.\r\n\r\n(1600-1612.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever indifferent Rudolf might have seemed to his duties as King\r\nof Bohemia, he was as anxious as most of his predecessors had been\r\nto maintain his ground in Hungary both against Turks and rebels. And\r\nduring the closing years of the sixteenth century he had gained new\r\nhopes of success in the struggle, from the submission which was at\r\nlast offered to him by the Prince of Transylvania. Unfortunately,\r\nhowever, for Rudolf, the cruelty of his general, Basta, produced such\r\ndisorders in the newly conquered province, that the Transylvanians\r\nrose against the Emperor, joined themselves to the discontented nobles\r\nof Hungary, and once more called in the Turks, who gained several\r\nvictories over the Imperial forces. Rudolf, like his predecessors, had\r\nbeen irritated at the opposition which had been offered by the various\r\nAssemblies of the Bohemian kingdom to his continual demands for money\r\nfor the Turkish war; and this opposition had been greatly increased\r\nby his attempt to extend the powers of that Hof-Kammer which had been\r\ninstituted by Ferdinand. That body, no longer contented with inquiring\r\ninto the debts and credits of the king, now wished to pry into the\r\nincomes of his subjects, and even to make its own arrangements for the\r\ncollecting of taxes. These encroachments were naturally resented by the\r\nBohemians; and the continual friction thus produced roused Rudolf to\r\nmore energetic action.\r\n\r\nNor were the differences with his subjects and the danger from the Turk\r\nthe only causes of this apparent change of disposition in the sluggish\r\nEmperor. The Austrian Archdukes had noticed the growing disorders in\r\nBohemia, as well as the neglect by Rudolf of the affairs of the Empire;\r\nand, on further inquiries, they found evidence that much of this\r\nneglect was due to the strange state of mind into which the Emperor\r\nwas falling. That shy and melancholy disposition which had led him,\r\nin the early part of his reign, to withdraw so much from public life,\r\nwas now ripening into a condition of morbid suspicion which had in\r\nit a strong taint of insanity. It is a curious sign of the extent to\r\nwhich superstition affected even great minds in the sixteenth century,\r\nthat this tendency in Rudolf was largely encouraged by a prophecy\r\nof the great Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe. The recent murder of\r\nHenry III. of France by the monk, Jacques Clément, had impressed the\r\nimagination both of the Emperor and the astronomer; and the latter had\r\nprophesied that the same fate which had overtaken the French king also\r\nawaited Rudolf. This prophecy had increased the Emperor’s tendency\r\nto morbid suspicion, and had led him still further to withdraw from\r\nthe public gaze. The Archdukes now inclined to believe that the only\r\nhope for good government was in the removal of Rudolf from power, and\r\nthe substitution of his brother Matthias on the thrones of Bohemia\r\nand Hungary and Austria. Rudolf resented this proposal with all the\r\nfierceness of a half crazy man; and this interference of his brothers,\r\ncombined with the advance of the Turks into Hungary, determined him to\r\nadopt a new policy.\r\n\r\nBoth in Hungary and Bohemia he saw, or believed, that the Protestants\r\nwere the main cause of the opposition to his power. He knew that in the\r\nkingdom of Bohemia they had continually resisted his decrees; and he\r\nbelieved them to be the prime movers of the Hungarian insurrections.\r\nTherefore, in 1602, he suddenly revived the old decree of Ladislaus\r\nwhich commanded the suppression of all sects in Bohemia. In pursuance\r\nof this decree, the chief meeting-house of the Bohemian Brotherhood in\r\nMláda Boleslav was closed; and Cardinal Dietrichstein began a regular\r\npersecution of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nIn 1604 the same policy was extended to Hungary; and when the\r\nHungarians endeavoured to protest, Rudolf issued a decree that all who\r\ntried to bring forward religious grievances in the Hungarian Assembly\r\nshould be treated as disorderly persons. Thereupon the Hungarians\r\nrose in insurrection, and chose as their leader Stephen Bocksay, a\r\nTransylvanian nobleman. Rudolf’s inability to provide payment for his\r\ntroops soon produced a mutiny among them; Bocksay succeeded, not only\r\nin conquering Transylvania, but in overrunning Hungary, and at last\r\nentering Moravia. Bocksay had hoped to persuade the Moravian Estates to\r\njoin him in defending the cause of civil and religious liberty. This\r\nthe Moravians were unwilling to do, as they hoped to come to terms\r\nwith Rudolf. But the unpopularity of Cardinal Dietrichstein, and the\r\ncruelties of Rudolf’s German troops, gradually weakened the sympathies\r\nof the Moravians for their king; and in the general state of misery\r\nand confusion which followed, two movements began to be developed for\r\nthe counteraction of Rudolf’s policy--movements widely different in\r\ncharacter and methods, but both intended to promote the cause of civil\r\nand religious liberty--and each of them finding its ablest and most\r\nearnest supporter in a member of the Bohemian Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nOf these the first to ripen into action was the movement which had\r\nits centre in Moravia, and its best and ablest champion in Charles\r\nof Z̆erotin. The life of this nobleman was a striking illustration\r\nof that effort after compromise, which has already been spoken of\r\nas so characteristic of the Brotherhood--an effort which makes it\r\nso interesting to the student of human nature, and which enabled it\r\nto gain so great an influence in the history of its country; though\r\nit produced a somewhat disappointing effect, if one looks to the\r\nBrotherhood for the highest embodiment of Christian life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORAVIAN WOMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe Z̆erotin family had long been established in Moravia, and had had\r\nmany claims to distinction, especially on the battlefield. They had\r\neagerly adopted the cause of Hus, and boasted that, since that time,\r\nthey had never had a Roman Catholic in their family. They had accepted\r\nthe principles of the Brotherhood, so far as they were consistent\r\nwith noble rank and the military profession; and John of Z̆erotin,\r\nthe father of Charles, had played as prominent a part in Moravia,\r\nin the character of protector of the poorer Brothers, as Conrad of\r\nKrajek had played in Bohemia. He had fallen under the influence of\r\nBlahoslav, and had imbibed something of his zeal for learning and his\r\nkeenly patriotic feelings. Charles had been sent, as a boy, to study\r\nat Strasburg, Basel, and Geneva; and his interest in the foreign\r\nProtestant communities had led him to desire that they should unite to\r\nresist the encroachments of Rome and Spain. He submitted strictly to\r\nthe rules of the Brotherhood in the choice of a wife, not venturing\r\nto ask in marriage the lady whom he had chosen, till he had consulted\r\nthe bishop and other leading members of the Brotherhood. In his zeal\r\nfor resistance to the power of Spain, he assisted Henry of Navarre in\r\nhis war against the Catholic League. But his disgust at the profligacy\r\nof Henry’s court ripened into absolute disapproval of the cause,\r\nwhen Henry was received back into the Catholic Church. Soon after\r\nthis event Z̆erotin took service under the Archduke Matthias in the\r\nwar against the Turks; and thus he gained the favour of Rudolf, and\r\nobtained an appointment in the Land Court of Moravia. Here he soon\r\nfound that Cardinal Dietrichstein and Ladislaus of Berka were making\r\ngreat efforts to strengthen the power of the Jesuits in Moravia, and\r\nto weaken the influence of the Protestants. Just at the time when\r\nCharles of Z̆erotin began to devote himself to the local government of\r\nMoravia, Charles of Lichtenstein, a member of an old Protestant family\r\nof Moravia, was converted to the Catholic faith; and soon after this\r\nDietrichstein was chosen Bishop of Olmütz.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the last Bishop had made ineffectual\r\nattempts to suppress the freedom of the press, and to crush out\r\nProtestantism. But Dietrichstein was so far from being warned by this\r\nfailure that he speedily set himself to restore a clause in the oath\r\nadministered to the officials in the Land Court, which recognised as\r\nnecessary the worship of the Virgin and the Saints. Z̆erotin soon\r\nbecame recognised as the opponent of the new Bishop; and once again\r\ncomes to the front the ever-reviving question of the Bohemian language.\r\nDietrichstein had been brought up in Spain, and spoke Spanish by\r\npreference; and though he could on occasion speak German, he had very\r\nlittle knowledge of Bohemian. Z̆erotin declared that if Dietrichstein\r\nwas to be allowed to take his seat in the Land Court of Moravia, he\r\nmust speak the language of that country; and the Cardinal in vain\r\nattempted to overrule this decision, and to obtain a hearing in German.\r\n\r\nThis struggle took place at the time when Rudolf was gradually\r\nresolving on a more oppressive policy; and Dietrichstein succeeded\r\nin bringing against Z̆erotin charges of treason, which induced the\r\nEmperor to summon him to Prague. His support of Henry IV., whom\r\nRudolf considered his enemy; his sympathy with the Count Palatine\r\nof the Rhine, who was already suspected of aiming at the Bohemian\r\ncrown; and his refusal, in deference to the religious principles of\r\nthe Brotherhood, to drink the Emperor’s health at a banquet, were\r\nall brought forward by Dietrichstein in proof of the charge; and the\r\nevident sympathy of the Moravian Estates for Z̆erotin was not likely to\r\nmake him more welcome to the Emperor. When, indeed, Z̆erotin was tried\r\nfor these offences in 1601, he was acquitted on all the charges against\r\nhim; but when Rudolf revived the enactment of Ladislaus against the\r\nsects, Z̆erotin was deprived of his office.\r\n\r\nHe now, for a time, retired from public life, and devoted himself to\r\nthe study of theology and the education of young noblemen. But his\r\nstudy of Calvinism, and his continual correspondence with those who\r\nstill maintained their interest in politics, prepared him for a return\r\nto public life. At the time of the invasion of Bocksay, Z̆erotin’s\r\nsympathies had been somewhat divided. He was, of course, zealous for\r\nreligious freedom; and he had a warm personal friendship for Stephen\r\nIllyezhazy, a leading Hungarian Protestant, who had great influence\r\nin Bocksay’s councils; but, on the other hand, he must have strongly\r\ndisliked the Turkish alliance; and he had a great personal loyalty to\r\nthe House of Hapsburg.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the hopes of Z̆erotin were more and more\r\ndirected to the proposal for putting forward Matthias in the place of\r\nRudolf. This arrangement would secure the crown of Bohemia to the House\r\nof Hapsburg, and would gain for the oppressed Protestants a leader\r\nwho might protect them at once against Rudolf and against the Turk.\r\nZ̆erotin’s Hungarian friend, Illyezhazy, was willing to accept this\r\npolicy; and even Lichtenstein, though a Catholic, consented to act\r\nwith the Protestant leaders in their championship of the candidature\r\nof Matthias. As Rudolf still resisted any proposal for compromise, the\r\nArchdukes decided to give power to Matthias to act as their chief in\r\nHungary and elsewhere; and he succeeded in making peace with Bocksay,\r\nby granting to the Hungarians full religious freedom and the election\r\nof their own Palatine. Rudolf, however, though he had been compelled\r\nto recognise Matthias as his general in Hungary, refused to consent\r\nto the terms of peace; and the miseries of Moravia were increased by\r\nthe cruelties of the troops sent to protect them, by the difficulties\r\nwhich Dietrichstein and Berka threw in the way of order, and by\r\nthe unwillingness of Rudolf to take any decided action of a useful\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAt last, therefore, in December, 1607, a meeting took place at\r\nZ̆erotin’s castle in Rosice, to which he invited, not only his Moravian\r\nfriends, but also the Hungarian Illyezhazy, and the leader of the\r\nProtestants in Upper Austria, George Erasmus von Tschernembl. They\r\nresolved to insist on the enforcement of the terms of peace in Hungary;\r\nand they demanded that the princes of the Empire should compel Rudolf\r\nto confirm the concessions of Matthias. Rudolf became alarmed, and\r\nprepared to suppress the movement by force of arms. Ladislaus von Berka\r\npersuaded the forces of General Tilly to come secretly into Moravia\r\nand concentrate themselves near Brünn (Brno). On March 7, 1608, the\r\nLand Court of Moravia held its sittings; and, on the night before its\r\nmeetings, Tilly’s troops were secretly introduced into the town. The\r\nchampions of Moravian liberty were, however, on the watch; and, when\r\nthe Land Court assembled, Carl von Lichtenstein suddenly entered it,\r\nat the head of sixty armed men, informed Berka of the introduction\r\nof the foreign soldiers, and demanded that, before they proceeded to\r\nfurther business, the Moravian nobles should take into consideration\r\nthe defence of their country. Berka declared that there was no danger,\r\nand demanded that they should proceed to the ordinary business of the\r\ncourt; whereupon Lichtenstein and his friends denounced Berka as a\r\ntraitor, drove him from the court, and sent fifty of the young nobles\r\nto guard the streets against the foreign troops.\r\n\r\nBut the old rivalry between the nobles and the towns suddenly showed\r\nitself at this crisis. The Town Council of Brünn refused to support the\r\nlords in their action; and, when the lords adjourned to Ivanc̆ic̆e,\r\nthe leading Moravian towns refused to send representatives to their\r\ndiscussions. Rudolf now summoned to Brünn the regular Assembly of the\r\nMoravian Estates; but he forbade them to consider any propositions,\r\nexcept those which should be laid before them by the royal\r\nCommissioners. Z̆erotin, however, protested so strongly against this\r\nlimitation, that the commissioners left Brünn without being able to get\r\ntheir propositions considered.\r\n\r\nZ̆erotin now looked about for further allies in the struggle, and\r\nthereby became aware of the very different schemes which were being\r\nformed against the power of Rudolf. The Brotherhood had already shown\r\nan inclination to an alliance with the German Calvinistic princes,\r\nand particularly with the Elector Palatine of the Rhine; and they had\r\nexcited some alarm, in 1577, by consenting to send representatives to\r\na meeting of the Calvinists at Heidelberg. Z̆erotin had maintained\r\na personal friendship with the Elector Palatine; but the policy of\r\nthat Court was now being largely guided and controlled by a prince of\r\nanother house, whose zeal for religious liberty was mixed with motives\r\nof a very different character. This was Christian, Prince of Anhalt,\r\nthe most prominent and active of the Calvinistic leaders of Germany,\r\nwhose restless personal ambition seemed almost to overshadow his zeal\r\nfor Protestantism; and who might be considered one of the chief causes\r\nof the ruin of Bohemian independence and the miseries of the Thirty\r\nYears War. His great aim was to overthrow the House of Hapsburg; and\r\nhe would have been willing, for that purpose, to absorb Bohemia and\r\nHungary in the German Empire. Z̆erotin, though at first willing to\r\nnegotiate with Christian as the leader of the German Protestants, soon\r\nfound that his aims and those of that prince were totally opposed. For\r\nthe present, however, everything was subordinated to the determination\r\nof the champions of constitutional liberty to combine against Rudolf.\r\n\r\nThe meeting took place at Ivanc̆ic̆e, in spite of the opposition of the\r\nEmperor and Berka. Berka was deprived of his captaincy; a provisional\r\ngovernment was established; and Charles of Lichtenstein was called upon\r\nto act as provisional Dictator. In proposing Lichtenstein, Z̆erotin was\r\nactuated partly by political, partly by religious, considerations. As\r\na statesman, Z̆erotin felt that it was necessary to win the support of\r\nmen of all creeds, by putting the question of orderly constitutional\r\ngovernment before the question of religious liberty; and he therefore\r\npreferred the choice of a Roman Catholic leader. But this political\r\ninstinct was strengthened by a religious scruple, which showed the\r\nstrong hold that the doctrine of the Brotherhood still maintained over\r\nZ̆erotin. He was still convinced that war in defence of his country or\r\nof constitutional government might be justified; but, as a follower\r\nof Peter of Chelc̆ic̆, he could not admit that it was lawful to stain\r\nthe cause of religious liberty by the shedding of blood. This scruple,\r\nhowever, did not diminish his sense of the necessity of vigorous\r\naction. The leaders of the meeting at Ivanc̆ic̆e resisted Rudolf’s\r\nattempts to disperse them, commanded Tilly to leave the country, and\r\nsucceeded in rousing such a feeling among the Moravians of the poorer\r\ntowns, that the Town Councils were overborne; and, with the exception\r\nof Olmütz, all the towns declared themselves on the constitutional\r\nside. Finally, the Assembly sent an invitation to Matthias, to ask him\r\nto undertake the government; and they hastened to Znojem to greet him\r\non his arrival.\r\n\r\nBut, although Z̆erotin had succeeded in effecting an alliance between\r\nMoravia, Hungary, and Austria, he had not yet succeeded in winning\r\nto his side the leaders of the Bohemian Assembly; and it was in his\r\nattempts to form this union that he was encountered by the opposition\r\nof another member of the Brotherhood, who followed a tradition\r\nsomewhat different from Z̆erotin’s. This was Wenceslaus Budovĕc of\r\nBudova, a leader among the Knights in the Assembly. He, like Z̆erotin,\r\nhad studied much in foreign countries, and had gained such favour\r\nwith Rudolf, that he had obtained a place on his Council. He soon\r\nbecame prominent in the Assembly; and, on the issue of Rudolf’s new\r\ndecree against the Protestants, he led the opposition to it in the\r\nAssembly. He was unwilling, however, to proceed to any extreme measures\r\nat first; and he even consented to vote the tax demanded by Rudolf,\r\nwithout making the repeal of the decree a condition precedent to the\r\nvote. He pointed out that, since the setting aside of the Compacts of\r\nBasel, there was no further pretence for saying that the Utraquists\r\nwere the only non-Catholics who were entitled to toleration. He dwelt\r\non the services done by the Brotherhood in the Turkish war; and he\r\nsucceeded in carrying a petition for the repeal of the decree; but\r\nbefore the petition could be presented, Rudolf dissolved the Assembly,\r\nand summoned Budovĕc before him. Budovĕc maintained that he had only\r\nexercised his lawful privilege as a Bohemian knight; and Rudolf thought\r\nit better to dismiss him for a time.\r\n\r\nBudovĕc now entered into friendly relations with Z̆erotin; but, when\r\nthe latter urged him to support the candidature of Matthias, Budovĕc\r\nmaintained that it was more advisable to appeal again to Rudolf. His\r\nreasons may be easily imagined. Matthias, like Rudolf, was a Roman\r\nCatholic; and his chief adviser was Khlesl, Bishop of Vienna, who was\r\nby no means inclined to measures of toleration. It was true that\r\nMatthias had granted liberties to the Protestants of Hungary; but it\r\nwas by no means certain that, if he were suffered to dictate his terms\r\nto Bohemia and Moravia at the point of the sword, backed by the whole\r\nsupport of his family, he might _then_ grant equal liberties to _them_.\r\nBudovĕc therefore preferred to see what the Protestants could gain\r\nfrom Rudolf when under the fear of Matthias’s advance, rather than\r\nto trust to what Matthias would do if he came as a conqueror. When,\r\nthen, Matthias, at the head of a Moravian, Austrian, and Hungarian\r\narmy, marched into Bohemia, Budovĕc and his friends declared their\r\nwillingness to stand by Rudolf.\r\n\r\nWhen, on May 19, 1608, Rudolf, for the first time for many years, met\r\nthe Assembly of Bohemia, Budovĕc at once demanded that, as Rudolf had\r\nalready made concessions to the Protestants of Hungary, he should\r\nnow grant the liberties required by the Protestants of Bohemia. The\r\nBohemian Confession of 1575 was to be recognised. Defenders were to be\r\nchosen to protect the interests of the Protestants. Offices were to be\r\ngranted in equal proportion to Protestants and Catholics. No foreigners\r\nwere to be allowed to manage Bohemian affairs. And, above all, no\r\none _of any rank_ was to be interfered with in matters of religious\r\nliberty. The importance of this last clause is not perhaps easy to\r\nrealise in our time; for, in fact, this is one of the very first\r\nassertions of the rights of _all_ men to religious liberty. Although\r\nit is probable that expressions may have been often used which, if\r\nlogically interpreted, would have involved principles of the most\r\ncomplete spiritual independence, yet both in Germany and Bohemia the\r\nmaxim “Cujus regio ejus religio,” had always been accepted as the legal\r\nand natural rule in religious affairs.\r\n\r\nIn Bohemia, as already mentioned, the condition of the peasantry had\r\nbecome more dependent during the 16th century; and, in 1585, the\r\nEstates had distinctly forbidden servants to leave their masters for\r\nthe purpose of entering trades, unless with the written permission of\r\nthose masters. The struggle described above, in the earlier years of\r\nRudolf’s reign, had been mainly a struggle between landed proprietors;\r\nand even a lady, who professed allegiance to the Brotherhood, had so\r\nfar misunderstood their doctrines as to drive a Utraquist preacher\r\nfrom her estates, and to compel her peasantry to attend the sermons of\r\na member of the Brotherhood. The principle, therefore, which Budovĕc\r\nasserted, was emphatically a new one; and he connected it, as will be\r\nseen, with appeals to the national feeling of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBesides the revival of the old and often repeated claim for the\r\nexclusion of foreigners from Bohemian offices, the petitioners\r\nemphasised their national position by a reference to the memories of\r\ntheir last national king. They demanded that the sword and crown which\r\nhad been taken from the statue of King George, in the Teyn Church,\r\nshould at once be restored to it. On this point alone Rudolf yielded.\r\nTo the other demands he refused to give an immediate answer. Yet even\r\nthis failure could not at once induce the Bohemian Estates to abandon\r\nthe cause of Rudolf for that of a prince who was invading Bohemia at\r\nthe head of a Hungarian army. This feeling was shared by the peasantry\r\nof Bohemia; and several collisions took place between them and the\r\nsoldiers of Matthias.\r\n\r\nBut, though Matthias could not succeed in the conquest of Bohemia,\r\nRudolf, on his part, was unable to defend or recover the rest of\r\nhis hereditary dominions; nor is it probable that Budovĕc and his\r\nfriends were at all prepared to engage in a war against their\r\nfellow-Protestants in Moravia, Hungary, and Austria. Rudolf, therefore,\r\nafter vainly attempting a compromise, consented to renounce Hungary and\r\nAustria in favour of Matthias, and to allow him to administer Moravia\r\nduring his lifetime. Matthias thereupon evacuated Bohemia; but Rudolf’s\r\nresistance was not yet at an end. He resented bitterly both the loss\r\nof his territories and the demands of the Bohemian Protestants; and,\r\nas he was not yet able to take any steps to recover his lost lands, he\r\nproceeded to turn his bitterness against Budovĕc and his allies.\r\n\r\nIn this course he was encouraged by three councillors, who were to play\r\na memorable part in the history of Bohemia--the Chancellor Lobkovic\r\nand the ministers Slavata and Martinic. The first proposal of the\r\nEmperor was not merely to reject the petition of the Protestants, but\r\nto treat their agreement to stand by each other as a conspiracy; and\r\nhe demanded that the document which contained the agreement should be\r\nhanded to him to be destroyed. The Protestants chose a Committee of\r\nTwelve to remonstrate with Rudolf on this demand; and at the head of\r\nthat committee they placed a man who was to become only too well known\r\nin Bohemian history, Count Matthias of Thurn. They waited on the King\r\nwith the document for which he had asked, but told him that they had\r\nonly produced it that he might know the names of his faithful subjects.\r\nRudolf seems, for the moment, to have been impressed with this protest,\r\nand consented not to destroy the petition.\r\n\r\nBudovĕc, however, and his friends were determined on using their\r\nopportunity to the utmost; and they were all the more eager in their\r\npressure, because they found that the official leader of the Assembly,\r\nAdam of Sternberg, was entirely out of sympathy with their efforts,\r\nand that he was continually endeavouring, on the one hand, to make\r\ndivisions between the Utraquists, the Lutherans, and the Brotherhood;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, he represented the Assembly to the Emperor\r\nas really willing to accept as satisfactory the offers which they in\r\nreality repudiated. The difficulties, which might have arisen from\r\nthis latter part of Sternberg’s policy, were obviated by the attitude\r\nof uncompromising resistance which was taken up by Lobkovic, Slavata,\r\nand Martinic. At last, on the advice of these councillors, Rudolf\r\ndecided to dissolve the Assembly. Then Budovĕc saw that the time for\r\nconstitutional agitation was nearly over; and on April 1, 1609, he\r\ngathered his friends together, and gave notice to the chief Burggraf of\r\nPrague that they were resolved to use force to resist all injustice.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were now obviously compelled to accept, in some respects,\r\nthat leadership of Matthias which they had previously opposed, the\r\nBohemian Protestants were not yet prepared to rely wholly on the King\r\nof Hungary. The Estates of Silesia and Lausitz, though largely in\r\nsympathy with the Protestant movement, had agreed with the Bohemians,\r\nin the previous year, in refusing to repudiate Rudolf. The Silesians\r\nwere now ready to follow the Bohemians in their more determined policy;\r\nand the Bohemians, on their part, were disposed to strengthen this\r\nalliance, by granting to Silesia that position of independent equality\r\nwhich they had hitherto refused. A league was therefore formed between\r\nthe Bohemian and Silesian Assemblies, of such a kind as might have been\r\nagreed upon between two independent Powers; and the Silesians were\r\nready enough to co-operate under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only on their immediate neighbours that the Bohemians\r\nrelied. They appealed also to the Protestant princes of Germany, both\r\nLutheran and Calvinistic; and from them, too, they received encouraging\r\nanswers. It was now evident that both sides were within a measurable\r\ndistance of war; but it was also clear that Rudolf might still have\r\na chance of preventing the insurrection from actually breaking out,\r\nby dividing the forces of his opponents, and depriving the movement\r\nof any legal centre. For greater security, the Assembly were now\r\nmeeting in the Council House of the New Town of Prague; and Rudolf,\r\ntherefore, ordered the Councillors of that part of the town to exclude\r\nthe Assembly from their hall. The Town Council pleaded that they had\r\ngiven their promise, and were obliged to abide by it; but the Estates\r\noffered to meet even in the Castle itself, if a room were provided for\r\nthem; and when Rudolf refused their proposal, they gathered in the open\r\nplace between All Saints’ Church and the cathedral. There Rudolf came\r\nto them, and rebuked them for continuing to meet. They answered by\r\nrequesting him to summon a General Assembly, which should represent not\r\nonly Bohemia, but all its dependent provinces. After some hesitation,\r\nRudolf consented to this proposal; but, as he persisted in forbidding\r\nthe Estates to hold any meetings in the interval, they returned to\r\ntheir former position in the Council House of the New Town.\r\n\r\nAdam von Sternberg had now been practically thrust aside by the\r\nAssembly; and Budovĕc was recognised not only as their actual but also\r\nas their official leader. He impressed on the movement that zealously\r\nreligious character which the Brotherhood always endeavoured to\r\nmaintain. He always opened the proceedings with prayer, and sternly\r\nrepressed all immorality or disorder among the followers of the nobles,\r\nwho were now flocking into the town. The Assembly felt that the use\r\nof physical force could not be much longer avoided; they attended the\r\nmeetings ready armed; and on one occasion, when an attack from the\r\nking’s forces was expected, even the workmen hastened into the square\r\nand brandished their tools for the fray.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the appeals of the Assembly for foreign help had been\r\nproducing their effect. Matthias, indeed, seemed for a time unwilling\r\nto press his victories further, and declined to interfere between\r\nRudolf and the Estates; but the German princes were so zealous in their\r\nappeals to the Emperor to make concessions, that he seemed at last\r\ndisposed to set aside the opinion of his more fiery Councillors, and\r\nhe summoned a General Assembly for the 25th of May, 1609. No sooner,\r\nhowever, did the Assembly meet, than Lobkovic recovered his former\r\ninfluence over the Emperor; and Rudolf began to hope that he might make\r\ndivisions between the Catholics and Protestants. On the other hand, the\r\ndemands of the Protestants appear to have grown more extreme at this\r\ntime; for they not only required the free profession of their creed and\r\nthe right to build churches, but they also insisted that the University\r\nof Prague and the Utraquist Consistory should be placed under the\r\ncontrol of the Estates.\r\n\r\nThis last demand excited more interest than the fallen condition of\r\nUtraquism might have led one to expect. But traditions of former\r\ngreatness have an incalculable influence; and many of the Protestants\r\nbelieved that the failure of Utraquism had been due as much to the\r\ncontrol which the king exercised over the Consistory as to any\r\ninternal weakness. Therefore the Assembly’s demand for control over\r\nthe Consistory excited considerable sympathy among all classes of\r\nProtestants. Rudolf, while unwilling to surrender his power in this\r\nmatter, was yet willing to propose a compromise, to the effect that the\r\nConsistory should be managed by a special tribunal composed half of\r\nProtestants and half of Catholics. As, however, he no doubt intended\r\nthat these should be appointed by himself, the Assembly considered\r\nthis answer as a complete rejection of their proposal; and on June\r\n22, 1609, the Estates resolved, on the motion of Count Thurn, to make\r\narrangements for the arming of the whole population. Their indignation\r\nwas still further roused by the oppression inflicted on the Protestants\r\nof Braunau by the abbot of that town; and the resolution for universal\r\narming was soon followed by the election of thirty Defenders for\r\ncarrying on the struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious proof of the aristocratic influences which still\r\nprevailed in the Assembly, that Peter Vok of Rosenberg was the first\r\nDefender chosen. He had been the only prominent Bohemian who had\r\nsympathised with Matthias’s invasion of Bohemia; and, though he had not\r\nsupported him by force of arms, he had supplied money to his troops.\r\nApart also from this difference of policy, Rosenberg must have been\r\na distasteful ally to the stricter Protestants, on account of his\r\nprofligate life. Other names of powerful families also appear in the\r\nlist, and at the same time Count Thurn was made general of the forces.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants now withdrew from their attendance at the Assembly;\r\nCount Thurn quickly gathered five hundred men together in three days;\r\nthe alliance with the Silesians was formally confirmed; and application\r\nwas made to Christian of Anhalt for further help.\r\n\r\nRudolf, alarmed at these proceedings, was yet further startled by\r\nthe news that Matthias had just granted to the Austrian Assembly\r\nall its demands for religious freedom. Moreover he found that\r\nthe Roman Catholic part of the Assembly, which had at first been\r\ndisposed to resist Budovĕc, were now ready to make terms with the\r\nProtestants. He therefore declared his willingness to accept the\r\nproposals of the Assembly on three conditions: (1) That they would\r\nsubstitute “Utraquist” for “Evangelical” in their description of the\r\nProtestants; (2) that they would accept the present concessions as a\r\nprovisional arrangement, until the general peace could be made with the\r\nProtestants; and (3) that they would abandon the proposal for universal\r\narming. Budovĕc answered by accepting the two first conditions; but\r\nhe declared that the Defenders could not consent, at present, to lay\r\ndown their arms without special authority from the Estates, and special\r\nsanction from the Silesians. Even this refusal Rudolf was obliged to\r\naccept; and on the 9th of July he signed the Letter of Majesty which\r\npractically decreed the points demanded by the Protestants. For the\r\nmoment it seemed as if the victory of religious freedom was complete;\r\nfor while, on the one hand, the power of the Estates was extended over\r\nthe University and the Consistory, and was still supported by an armed\r\nforce, on the other hand the concession of religious liberty was no\r\nlonger confined to communities or privileged classes, but extended to\r\nevery man and woman in the Bohemian kingdom.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the apparent peace was a very hollow one. Christian of\r\nAnhalt, arriving in Prague very shortly after this decision, was\r\nat first somewhat startled to find the matter settled without his\r\nintervention; but he soon discovered that neither Rudolf nor the\r\nAssembly were satisfied. Budovĕc and his friends were eager to follow\r\nup their victory by securing the removal of Lobkovic from the councils\r\nof Rudolf, while they wished to guard themselves against future\r\nattacks by an amnesty for any offences committed during the struggle.\r\nRudolf, on his part, while conceding the amnesty, tried hard to throw\r\ndifficulties in the way of the complete equality between Protestants\r\nand Catholics; and he further hoped to stir up division between the\r\ndifferent sections of the Protestants. Had Rudolf been left to himself,\r\nthese intrigues might have proved the mere fitful caprices of a weak\r\nmind, and might have been followed by equally startling concessions.\r\nBut he had now fallen into the hands of a much more daring and\r\nunscrupulous adviser than any who had hitherto swayed his counsels.\r\n\r\nThis was his young kinsman, the Archduke Leopold, who had stood\r\nby him when the rest of the family had demanded his submission to\r\nMatthias, and who now flattered him with the hopes of recovering his\r\npower in Bohemia. Leopold seems, from first to last, to have been as\r\nself-seeking in his objects as he was unscrupulous in his methods. His\r\nfirst wish was to secure for himself that province of Jülich which was\r\nthe subject of so much controversy between several of the Protestant\r\nprinces, and which Leopold had been allowed by Rudolf to occupy in\r\nthe Emperor’s name. Soon, however, he discovered that his hopes of\r\nJülich would be frustrated even by Powers to whom he had looked for\r\nsupport; and, from that time, he fixed his hopes on the succession to\r\nthe Bohemian crown. Rudolf, while listening to the violent proposals of\r\nLeopold, was anxious to secure, if possible, the recovery of the lands\r\nwhich Matthias had conquered; and for that recovery he expected help\r\nfrom the discontented Austrian Protestants and from some of the princes\r\nof the Empire. He therefore summoned a Convention of princes to Prague,\r\nand distinctly demanded the restoration to him of Austria, Hungary, and\r\nMoravia.\r\n\r\nThe times were terribly critical. The occupation of Donauwörth by the\r\nElector of Bavaria, the controversy about the succession to Jülich, the\r\nformation of the Protestant Union by Christian of Anhalt, and of the\r\nCatholic League by Maximilian of Bavaria, all seemed to point to an\r\napproaching war in the Empire; while the military preparations which\r\nHenry IV. was making in France foreshadowed a European character for\r\nany conflict that might take place. Under these circumstances, however,\r\nthe wiser statesmen in the Empire were anxious to minimise the evil as\r\nfar as possible, and to make efforts for the preservation of peace.\r\n\r\nForemost among the peacemakers was the Archbishop of Köln; but\r\nunfortunately he was too much in advance of his age to produce the\r\nresults which a more commonplace politician might have accomplished.\r\nHe proposed a scheme of universal disarmament, and he suggested\r\nthe reference of the Jülich controversy to the arbitration of the\r\nUniversities. These proposals were cut short by a new outbreak of\r\nwar between some of the claimants to the Jülich estate; while the\r\nassassination of Henry IV. once more raised the hopes of Rudolf and his\r\nfriends, and made them disinclined to concession. But others besides\r\nthe Archbishop of Köln desired to reconcile Rudolf to Matthias; and in\r\nspite of evasions and resistances, Rudolf was forced, in September,\r\n1610, to recognise his brother as holding under him the lands of\r\nHungary, Moravia, and Austria.\r\n\r\nThis concession was, if possible, even less honest in intention than\r\nthe confirmation of the Letter of Majesty had been; for the coldness\r\nwith which he had been treated by the princes of the Empire had made\r\nRudolf even more inclined than before to throw himself into the\r\ndangerous plans of the Archduke Leopold. Even while the Convention of\r\nPrinces was sitting and the negotiations with Matthias were proceeding,\r\nLeopold was raising troops in the Bavarian district of Passau, and by\r\nthe time that the agreement was concluded this force had grown to a\r\nconsiderable size. Peter Vok of Rosenberg had called attention to the\r\ndanger incurred by his town of Krumov through the neighbourhood of\r\nthese soldiers; and the Bohemian Assembly demanded that, since peace\r\nhad now been made, this force should be disbanded. Rudolf pleaded that\r\nhe could not yet dismiss them, because he had no money for the payment\r\nof their wages; and he proposed that, to secure them better quarters,\r\nthey should be sent to Krumov and Budweis (Budejóvice). The Bohemian\r\nAssembly indignantly protested against the introduction of foreign\r\ntroops into their country, and they refused to vote any money for their\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nRudolf thereupon appealed to the Duke of Brunswick to advance him\r\nmoney; and the Duke succeeded in getting various promises which soon\r\namounted to the sum required. When he arrived at Passau, he found that\r\nLeopold and several of the other commanders had left for Prague; that\r\nColonel Ramée, who was in command, would not listen to proposals of\r\ndelay; and that the paymaster of the forces was being hindered from\r\nreceiving the money which had been raised for the troops. At last,\r\nwhen the soldiers had been worked up to a state of frenzy by the\r\nnon-fulfilment of the promises of payment, Ramée suddenly led them\r\ninto Upper Austria, where they committed every kind of cruelty on the\r\ndefenceless inhabitants. Rudolf had cherished the wild hope that the\r\ndiscontent of the Austrian Protestants with Matthias would make them\r\nwilling to revolt from him; but he soon found that, whatever might\r\nbe their disagreements with their present ruler, they at any rate\r\npreferred him to Rudolf. So, after failing to obtain any success in\r\nAustria, Leopold suddenly changed his plans; and in February, 1611,\r\nthe Bohemian Assembly were startled by the news that the Passau forces\r\nhad entered Bohemia, had seized Krumov, and had soon after captured\r\nBudejóvice and Tabor. A little later came the news that Ramée was on\r\nhis march to Prague.\r\n\r\nLeopold offered to go out to meet the troops, and to order them to\r\nreturn to Krumov; but on February 13th he suddenly reappeared before\r\nPrague at the head of the very forces that he had pretended to disband.\r\nTwo days later they broke into the Small Division of the town; and,\r\nthough gallantly resisted by Count Thurn at the head of both soldiers\r\nand citizens, Leopold succeeded in mastering that division of the\r\ncity. But in the Old and New Town the citizens rallied and drove back\r\nthe Passauer. The old fierce spirit now awoke in Prague; and, as soon\r\nas Leopold and his forces had been expelled from the Old Town, the\r\ncitizens attacked and destroyed several of the monasteries; and the\r\ntroops of the Assembly with difficulty succeeded in saving the Jesuit\r\nCollege from a similar fate. Leopold now marched against the Castle,\r\nand, after a short parley, persuaded the troops to surrender. A herald\r\nwas next despatched to the Karlsbrücke to demand that the Old Town\r\nshould receive a Passau garrison. Count Thurn and two of the other\r\ngenerals were wounded, and prisoners in the hands of the enemy; and\r\nBudovĕc had been sent into Moravia shortly before the advance of the\r\nPassauer. But though deprived of their leaders, both military and\r\nspiritual, the Praguer still held out against the enemy. The Imperial\r\nherald was dismissed with scorn; and when Ramée threatened to fire upon\r\nthe town, several workmen announced that, at the first shot, every\r\nCatholic in the city should be put to death. Rudolf himself became\r\nshocked at the cruelties which had been committed, and refused to\r\nallow Ramée to set the town on fire. The peasantry flocked in from the\r\nsurrounding districts to help in the defence; while they cut off and\r\nkilled all the supporters of the Passauer whom they could find in the\r\noutskirts of the town. Budovĕc returned from Moravia at this crisis,\r\nand encouraged the Praguer by promises of fresh help, and it soon\r\nbecame known that Matthias was on his march to Prague.\r\n\r\nLeopold, as cowardly as he was cruel, now proposed to desert the cause\r\nof Rudolf, and offered his services to Matthias. The latter, however,\r\nwould have nothing to say to him; and Ramée, in his turn becoming\r\nalarmed, tried to make sure of his spoil by sending it in waggons\r\nout of the city. The Praguer, however, succeeded in intercepting\r\nthese waggons, and in arresting, at the same time, one of Leopold’s\r\nintriguers. The prisoner at once confessed the whole plot; and Ramée,\r\nfearing the results of the discovery, secretly marched away from the\r\ncity. In order to persuade his troops to go the more readily, he\r\nproduced a portion of their long withheld pay. This suddenly revealed\r\nto them the base intrigue of which they had been at once the victims\r\nand the tools; and they called upon their colonel to lead them back to\r\nPrague, to execute vengeance on Leopold. Leopold however, succeeded in\r\nescaping secretly from the city, and went to Budejóvice, where he still\r\nhoped to make a stand; but when the Pope himself wrote to tell him that\r\nhe had injured and disgraced the Catholic cause, the miserable creature\r\nfelt the helplessness of his position, and tried to convince the Pope\r\nthat he had been in no way responsible for the march of the Passauer.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Matthias was welcomed as a deliverer. On April 12,\r\n1611, the Bohemian Assembly once more met; and, after some wrangling\r\nbetween the Estates of the different provinces, about the language to\r\nbe used and the methods to be followed, they deposed Rudolf from the\r\nthrone of Bohemia; and on May 22nd he himself consented to free his\r\nsubjects from their allegiance, and to allow Matthias to be crowned in\r\nhis place. Even now the unfortunate Emperor still hoped to redeem his\r\nposition by fresh intrigues; and he seems actually to have entertained\r\nthe idea of appealing to Christian of Anhalt, and the Protestants,\r\nagainst Matthias; but ill health, misfortunes, and growing old age\r\ninterfered to cut short any further plots; and his miserable life at\r\nlast ended in January, 1612.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE DEATH OF RUDOLF II. TO THE BATTLE OF THE WHITE HILL.\r\n\r\n(1612-1620.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Matthias seemed now to be securely seated on the throne of\r\nBohemia, he was quite aware that his difficulties were by no means at\r\nan end. He had been put forward, originally, as the candidate rather of\r\nhis family than of the Bohemian people; and his necessary concessions\r\nto popular feeling, in the matter of civil and religious liberty, had\r\noften roused the opposition of his kinsmen.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of his position had been somewhat mitigated during\r\nhis first triumphs in Moravia by the judicious statesmanship,\r\nadministrative ability, and personal popularity of Z̆erotin. On the\r\none hand he had persuaded his friends to keep in the background their\r\nextremer demands for religious liberty; and on the other hand he had\r\ncontrived, by ingenious exercises of administrative power, to strain\r\nthe actual concessions of the new ruler to such an extent that they\r\nproved a better check on the tyranny of nobles and priests than the\r\n(verbally) larger concessions of Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty. Illyezhazy\r\nand the Hungarian Protestants had consented to follow the lead of\r\nZ̆erotin in these matters; but in Austria Matthias had already had\r\na foretaste of the embarrassments which were to be increased by his\r\nconquest of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nTschernembl, who led the Protestants of Upper Austria, was by no means\r\ndisposed to be content with half measures, either in civil or religious\r\nliberty. He was a strong Calvinist; and while he had none of Z̆erotin’s\r\nscruples about religious wars, he was also far more indifferent than\r\nthe Moravian noble to kings in general, and to the House of Hapsburg\r\nin particular. Under his leadership the Protestants of Upper Austria\r\ndemanded the fullest securities for their liberties, before they would\r\naccept Matthias as their Duke; and they seized on a castle in Linz,\r\nas a pledge for future concessions. In Lower Austria the Protestants\r\nwere, at this time, less numerous or less determined; for when, in\r\nSeptember, 1608, Matthias summoned representatives of both the Austrian\r\nprovinces to meet at Vienna, he found himself able to resist and defeat\r\nthe demands of the Protestants. Upon this, Tschernembl and his friends\r\nat once left the city, and took up their quarters at Horn, from which\r\nstep they became known as the “Horner.” This policy of Tschernembl’s\r\nproduced some coolness between him and Z̆erotin; Tschernembl was in\r\nconsequence thrown into closer relations with the German Protestants;\r\nso when, in November, 1608, Peter Vok von Rosenberg invited Christian\r\nof Anhalt to meet Z̆erotin and Tschernembl at Tr̆ebon̆, the Austrian\r\nconsented to come, but the Moravian refused.\r\n\r\nZ̆erotin, however, while anxious to hinder violent opposition to\r\nMatthias, had no wish to hinder the growth of Austrian liberty nor to\r\nbreak the link between the Austrian and Bohemian Protestants; so he\r\nstrongly urged Matthias to concede the demands of Tschernembl and his\r\nfriends, in a peaceable manner. This advice was the more important\r\nbecause Tschernembl was inclined, in a moment of irritation, to listen\r\nto advances from Rudolf; but he soon discovered the folly of that\r\ncourse, and at the same time he began to lose faith in the promises\r\nof Christian of Anhalt. Thus Z̆erotin was able once more to bring his\r\nking and his friend together; and in March, 1609, Matthias granted much\r\nwider liberties to the Austrian Protestants than he had yet conceded in\r\nMoravia.\r\n\r\nBut this triumph of Z̆erotin’s policy brought on him the fierce\r\nhostility of Bishop Khlesl, who even refused to give the Sacrament\r\nto Matthias and his councillors, on the occasion of the festival of\r\nreconciliation between the Duke of Austria and his subjects. Nor was\r\nZ̆erotin contented with Matthias’s own action; for the latter began\r\nto show signs, at that time, of an inclination to treat with Rudolph;\r\nand a proposal of the Moravian Assembly to disband some of its forces\r\njust before the outbreak of the Passau rising, was in vain resisted\r\nby Z̆erotin. When, then, Matthias finally succeeded in winning the\r\ncrown of Bohemia, he found himself surrounded by Councillors who were\r\nbitterly opposed to each other, and who had each their own reasons for\r\ndistrusting their King.\r\n\r\nNor were Matthias’s difficulties confined to those larger questions\r\nof civil and religious liberty which affected the whole kingdom.\r\nThe reunion of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia under one king, at\r\nonce reawakened controversies which had, for some time, fallen into\r\nthe background. Silesia was by no means disposed to abandon that\r\nposition of equal alliance with Bohemia which had been granted in the\r\nhour of danger; and Moravia did not desire to exchange the complete\r\nindependence which she had gained by separation, for the subordinate\r\ncondition in which the Bohemians wished to place her. Concessions\r\ntherefore had to be made to the local feeling of the dependent\r\nprovinces--concessions which might conceivably have worked well in a\r\ntime of complete peace, but which, in a time of continual disorder and\r\nmutual suspicion, led necessarily to further difficulties.\r\n\r\nBut Khlesl saw that these local divisions, though they might at first\r\nsight seem to embarrass Matthias, could yet be made, by judicious\r\nmanagement, to promote those schemes for the increase of the royal\r\npower which the ambitious bishop had been always devising. It was in\r\nHungary that he specially hoped to lay the foundations of a firmer\r\ndespotism; and the method by which he hoped to accomplish it was a war\r\nfor the conquest and annexation of Transylvania. For this purpose he\r\nstirred up the Transylvanians against their Prince, and then backed\r\nthe insurgents by an invasion of their territory. The suspicions of\r\nthe Hungarian Protestants were, however, quickly aroused; and Matthias\r\nwas deserted by his troops. Then he appealed to Moravia for help, on\r\nthe ground of the dangers to which their province would be exposed\r\nby a Turkish invasion, and the consequent need of consolidating the\r\nHungarian power for their protection.\r\n\r\nHere again Khlesl was, for the time, defeated by Z̆erotin, who opposed\r\nthe war on the ground that no Hungarian Assembly had sanctioned it;\r\nbut when Z̆erotin followed up this victory by attempting to revive\r\nhis scheme for a common Assembly of all Matthias’s subjects, he was\r\nsuccessfully opposed by the Bohemians, who declined any close union\r\nwith Austria or Hungary.\r\n\r\nBut if, for the time, Khlesl’s hopes for strengthening Matthias, by\r\nthe divisions among his subjects, had been scarcely realised to the\r\nfull, he soon found a new encouragement in the increased power and\r\ndignity which the King of Bohemia gained by his election to the throne\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire. Z̆erotin, indeed, had himself supported\r\nMatthias’s candidature in order to exclude a more dangerous claimant;\r\nbut, nevertheless, the election was felt to be a distinct gain to the\r\nCatholic and despotic party; and Khlesl took advantage of it to renew\r\nhis attacks on the Protestants. In these attacks he was backed by\r\nDietrichstein, the Bishop of Olmütz, who hoped that Matthias would help\r\nhim to increase his power over the clergy and their dependants.\r\n\r\nBut again Z̆erotin succeeded in resisting the clerical encroachments\r\nin Moravia; and his opposition so impressed the Archduke Maximilian\r\nthat he used his influence with Matthias to obtain concessions to the\r\nProtestants. Matthias, however, soon found that no concessions would\r\ninduce the Moravian Estates to sanction the Hungarian war; and even an\r\nappeal to the Presburg Assembly had no better success.\r\n\r\nImperial authority having thus failed, Matthias once more fell back\r\non his old attempt to sow division among his subjects. This time,\r\nhowever, he appealed not to provincial jealousies, but to the old class\r\nrivalries between citizen and noble. He had, no doubt, heard how his\r\noriginal conquest of Moravia had been hindered by the opposition of\r\nthe city burgomasters to the decision of the nobles; and he therefore\r\nhoped that, now that the nobles were his most dangerous enemies, the\r\nmunicipal authorities might be induced to rally round him. He was\r\nfurther strengthened in this belief by the recollection that his\r\naristocratic supporters had been willing to abandon on behalf of the\r\ntowns those religious liberties which they had claimed to exercise on\r\ntheir own estates.\r\n\r\nThis time he hit the mark. The Town Councils of Brünn and Olmütz\r\nreadily responded to his appeal to support him against his rebellious\r\nnobles; and they even denounced to the King those citizens who had\r\ncomplained of the exclusion of Protestants from the government of the\r\ntowns. Matthias encouraged these appeals, and disregarded the protest\r\nof Z̆erotin, who maintained that the towns could only approach the King\r\nthrough the Captain of Moravia.\r\n\r\nHaving secured this weapon, Matthias determined to use it to the\r\nuttermost. Hitherto, the houses of the nobles had been free from any\r\ninterference, in the matter of religious worship; and citizens, who\r\nhad been excluded from Protestant services elsewhere, had been allowed\r\nto attend them when celebrated in a nobleman’s house. Now, however,\r\nMatthias not only took away this liberty, but summoned to Vienna some\r\nof the citizens who attended these services.\r\n\r\nYet no threats nor tyrannies could induce the Estates to sanction\r\nthe Transylvanian war; and Matthias’s insistence on this expedition\r\nonly roused the suspicion of the German Princes, and once more drew\r\nChristian of Anhalt into alliance with the Protestants of Bohemia,\r\nAustria, and Hungary.\r\n\r\nHad Matthias been a shrewder politician, he would have abstained from\r\ngiving artificial stimulus to the local jealousies of his subjects, and\r\nwould have suffered them to grow into importance of their own accord.\r\nIt soon appeared that, whatever reaction might be exerted by the\r\nking’s mischief-making policy, the rivalry between Moravia and Bohemia\r\nwas still an important force in national politics. It is not easy to\r\nestimate the exact force of all the considerations which influenced\r\nthe leaders of the rival provinces. The name of liberty, for instance,\r\ncould be appealed to, with some sincerity, on either side of the\r\ncontroversy. Z̆erotin, for his part, was thoroughly convinced that a\r\ncentralised administration at Prague would hinder the free play of the\r\nlocal institutions of Moravia, and would also weaken the possibilities\r\nof that independent alliance between Austria, Bohemia, Silesia,\r\nMoravia, and Hungary, which seemed to him the best protection for the\r\nProtestants against the encroachments of the Catholic party.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Bohemians could justly maintain that Rudolf’s\r\nLetter of Majesty gave them, and all who united with them, wider\r\nliberties than any which were secured by the laws of Moravia; and,\r\ncuriously enough, the most dependent classes of Moravia had been\r\ndeprived by their separation from Bohemia of a right of appeal to a\r\ncourt at Prague which still gave them some slight protection against\r\nthe power of their lords.\r\n\r\nBut, important as all these questions were, they were gradually driven\r\ninto the background by one of more immediate interest to the rival\r\nleaders. Z̆erotin had, as already mentioned, a special feeling of\r\nloyalty to the House of Hapsburg, which was not shared in the same\r\ndegree by the leaders of the Bohemian Protestants. So Budovĕc and his\r\nfriends were rapidly arriving at the conclusion that the best security\r\nfor their liberties was to be found, not in the substitution of one\r\nHapsburg for another, but in the deposition of the whole family in\r\nfavour of some king who had a real respect for religious liberty. To\r\nsuch a step Z̆erotin could not consent; and it was no doubt because he\r\nwas aware of this difference, that Matthias now began to recognise the\r\nBohemian leaders as his chief enemies, and to devote himself to the\r\nspecial oppression of their province.\r\n\r\nIn 1613, the freedom of the press was suspended in Bohemia, and a\r\ncensorship was re-established. A Jesuit preacher denounced the Letter\r\nof Majesty, declaring that it had never been formally sanctioned by\r\nRudolf. The Archbishop of Prague began to close Protestant churches and\r\nto turn out Protestant priests. But a still more ominous hint of the\r\nbitterness of the approaching struggle was to be found in the character\r\nof the man whom the Archdukes now chose as the representative of their\r\nfamily in the controversy. The conciliatory policy of the Archduke\r\nMaximilian seemed a hopeless failure. Matthias, in the opinion of his\r\nkinsmen, was becoming as incapable as Rudolf had been. They therefore\r\nresolved to choose from their family a man of strong and determined\r\ncharacter, who would be willing if necessary to take the most extreme\r\nmeasures for enforcing their policy.\r\n\r\nThis champion of the family reaction was found in Ferdinand, Duke of\r\nStyria. He had been trained by the Jesuits in a fierce enthusiasm for\r\nthe Catholic faith. He had carried out a ruthless policy in Styria\r\nagainst the Protestant preachers; and he had there compelled both\r\ncitizens and peasants to attend the Catholic services. He had already\r\nbeen proposed by the extremer Catholics as a candidate for the Imperial\r\nthrone; and it was to hinder his election that Z̆erotin supported the\r\nelection of Matthias. Matthias, indeed, was now weary of his position,\r\nand he was particularly glad that Ferdinand should take his place in\r\nfacing the hostility of the Moravian Assembly; but a new, and perhaps\r\nunexpected, opponent came forward at the next meeting of that Assembly,\r\nto resist the policy of the Emperor and his champion. Bishop Khlesl had\r\nnever been popular with the main body of the House of Hapsburg. They\r\nconsidered that his personal influence over Matthias tended to separate\r\nthe policy of that prince from the general schemes of the House. The\r\nBishop therefore understood that the rise of Ferdinand to power would\r\nbe the prelude to his own fall. His recent elevation to the rank of\r\nCardinal encouraged him to venture on a more independent policy; and,\r\nwith the help of Z̆erotin, he succeeded in defeating another proposal\r\nfor a grant in aid of the Transylvanian war.\r\n\r\nBut Matthias’s old policy of ruling by dividing was at last to obtain\r\nan unexpected and signal success. It will be remembered that Silesia,\r\nlike Moravia, had secured, after Matthias’s coronation in Prague, a\r\nmuch more independent position than had been conceded to it in earlier\r\ndays; and it was one result of the new position of these provinces,\r\nthat they were now able and eager to contend against each other, like\r\nindependent kingdoms, for the possession of territory which might have\r\nbeen previously accepted by them as a part of their common Kingdom of\r\nBohemia. The land specially in dispute was the district of Troppau,\r\nwhich appears to have had some separate Assembly of its own, but\r\nwhich some of the dukes of Silesia considered to be closely connected\r\nwith their province. The Moravians, on the other hand, believed that\r\nTroppau more properly belonged to them; and, as they were more ready to\r\nrecognise the rights of the Troppau Assembly, it seems probable that\r\nthe popular feeling in that district would incline to the Moravian\r\nside. But Matthias, remembering that Moravia had successfully opposed\r\nhis military projects, eagerly advocated the cause of Silesia; and,\r\nwhile securing to that province a more complete independence of the\r\nBohemian Chancellor, he declared at the same time that the ruler of\r\nTroppau must be a prince of Silesia. To weaken the Moravians still\r\nfurther, by sowing division in their own ranks, he chose Karl von\r\nLichtenstein as Duke of Troppau and Prince of Silesia. The bitter\r\nquarrel which followed this decision had an important effect on the\r\nfuture of the country; for Charles of Z̆erotin was thereby convinced\r\nthat his hope for a peaceful league between the three provinces had\r\nbecome a vain dream; and, in February, 1615, he resigned his Captaincy\r\nof Moravia, and was succeeded by a member of the Catholic party.\r\n\r\nWhile this increasing separation between the differing provinces was\r\nbringing further weakness to the Protestant cause, the Archdukes were\r\nbeing driven forward to an extremer Catholic policy. The new attitude\r\nof Khlesl had irritated against him even the moderate Maximilian, and\r\nhad decided the Archdukes to demand the deposition of Khlesl’s patron\r\nand pupil, first from the Bohemian, and afterwards from the Imperial,\r\nthrone; and the substitution of Ferdinand for him in both those\r\ndignities.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how it was that, in June, 1617, the\r\nCatholic party seem to have gained a power in Bohemia greater than they\r\npossessed either in the previous or the following year; though no doubt\r\nthe surprise at Matthias’s decision, and the absence of any possible\r\nsuccessor, had placed the Estates in a position of great difficulty.\r\nAt any rate, so it was, that Count Thurn and Colonna von Fels were\r\nthe only members of the Assembly who ventured to oppose Ferdinand’s\r\nelection; while the majority not only raised no objection, but even\r\nabandoned that right of free election on which they had insisted in the\r\ntime of Ferdinand I.; and they “accepted” their new sovereign as the\r\nnecessary heir to the kingdom. Some little remnant of spirit, however,\r\nwas shown in the demand that Ferdinand should confirm the privileges\r\nof the Estates before he was crowned; and, after consulting with his\r\nJesuit advisers, he gave his approval, even to Rudolf’s Letter of\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Ferdinand seated on the throne, than he proceeded to\r\nviolate the principle, if not the letter, of the promises which he had\r\njust made. He directed the judges of his chief tribunal to preside at\r\nthe meetings of the Church Congregations in Prague; to inquire into all\r\ntheir accounts, and to allow no decision to be passed by them which\r\nthe judges had not approved. Further they were to examine all the\r\ninstitutions connected with each church; to find out if they carried\r\nout the purposes of their founders and, if not, to compel them to do\r\nso. This decree was intended as a step towards the restoration to the\r\nCatholics of all the churches which had passed into Utraquist hands. At\r\nthe same time, the Archbishop of Prague, who had already demanded the\r\nclosing of a Protestant church at Hroby, now insisted that that church\r\nshould be pulled down. Sometimes, as in the case of the monastery\r\nof Braunau, the encroachments of the Catholics were defended on the\r\nground of some peculiar interpretation of Rudolf’s Letter of Majesty;\r\nbut it was evident that the attacks on the Protestants would not long\r\nbe limited by any legal pretences. The Defenders of the Protestants,\r\nwho had been chosen during the struggle against Rudolf, still retained\r\ntheir offices; and they now summoned a Protestant Assembly to meet in\r\nPrague on March 5, 1618. The towns, however, would not venture to send\r\nrepresentatives to this Assembly; and the nobles who did come decided\r\nto defer action until the Estates of all the Crown Lands could meet on\r\nthe 21st of May.\r\n\r\nThe Royalist Party resolved to counteract this movement by every\r\nmeans in their power. They tried hard to separate the towns still\r\nfurther from the nobles; and they hoped to draw the representatives\r\nof the old Utraquists away from the other Protestants. The attempt\r\nto influence the towns had some partial success; but nevertheless\r\nsix of them (including Kutna Hora and Mláda Boleslav) consented to\r\nsend representatives to the new Assembly. The attempt to separate\r\nthe Utraquists from their fellow Protestants was a complete failure,\r\nfor all the parish clergy of Prague consented to announce from their\r\npulpits the meeting of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt was now clear that a violent crisis was unavoidable; and no sooner\r\ndid the Assembly meet in the Carolinum than two officials of the\r\nEmperor entered the building, and announced that Matthias forbad them\r\nto continue their discussions. The Protestants were seriously alarmed;\r\nand Count Thurn demanded that, as they had been summoned to the Castle\r\nto meet the representatives of the Emperor, they should be allowed to\r\nwear arms on that occasion. The official representative of Matthias\r\nconsented to this proposal; and on May 22nd Count Thurn had a special\r\nmeeting with Budovĕc, Colonna von Fels, and a few others, at which\r\nthey resolved on their plan of action. A rumour rapidly spread that\r\nthe Protestants were planning some violent attack; and one of the\r\nofficials fled secretly to Vienna.\r\n\r\nOn May 23rd the Estates gathered in the great Hall of Assembly at the\r\nCastle; and, as soon as the letter of the Emperor had been read, the\r\nProtestants read their letter of protest against his prohibition of\r\ntheir meeting. Then they demanded to know who had advised the Emperor\r\nto threaten the Estates. Adam of Sternberg, who was now chief Burggraf\r\nof Prague, refused to answer this question, on the ground that Privy\r\nCouncillors were not bound to reveal the advice which they had given\r\nto the Emperor. Count Thurn replied that the Estates would not leave\r\nthat place till they had received an answer to their question. Then a\r\nnumber of charges were fiercely poured out against the advisers of the\r\nEmperor; and Martinic and Slavata were reminded of their resistance\r\nto the Assembly of 1609, and especially of their refusal to sign the\r\nLetter of Majesty. One of Count Thurn’s followers denounced them as\r\nenemies of the commonwealth; and this charge was received with shouts\r\nof applause by the other members of the Estates. Sternberg entreated\r\nthe Assembly to be calm; but he was urged to retire from the Hall,\r\nand was at last forced out of it, with one of the other officials.\r\nThen William of Lobkovic suddenly seized upon Martinic, and, after a\r\nfierce struggle, flung him from the window down into the castle ditch,\r\nwhich was twenty-eight ells below; and Thurn threw Slavata after him.\r\nTheir secretary, Fabricius, protested, and was in his turn thrown out\r\nof the window. Wonderful to say, none of the three were killed; and\r\nonly Fabricius seems to have been seriously injured. They succeeded\r\nin taking refuge in the house of the Chancellor; and afterwards they\r\nescaped secretly from the city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALL IN THE CASTLE OF PRAGUE FROM WHENCE MARTINIC AND\r\nSLAVATA WERE THROWN.]\r\n\r\nA provisional government was at once formed of thirty Defenders.\r\nWenceslaus of Ruppa, who had taken a leading part in this plot, was\r\nchosen President, and Count Thurn was once more appointed General\r\nof the Bohemian forces. The towns now gathered courage to join\r\nthe movement; and only Budweis (Budejóvice), Pilsen (Plz̆en), and\r\nKrumov remained on the side of the Emperor. Matthias would even now\r\nhave wished to conciliate his opponents; and, on the 6th of June,\r\na messenger arrived in Prague announcing the Emperor’s willingness\r\nonce more to confirm the Letter of Majesty. But this message was\r\nspeedily followed by a letter from Ferdinand, announcing that he would\r\nonly observe the Letter of Majesty in the same way that he had done\r\nhitherto; and he further threatened punishment against all who would\r\nnot keep the peace. The Assembly saw the significance of this letter,\r\nand continued their preparations for war.\r\n\r\nFerdinand was now eager for action; but he found that Matthias still\r\nhindered his proceedings. This opposition the Archdukes attributed\r\nto the influence of Khlesl; and Maximilian was entrusted with the\r\noffice of suppressing the Cardinal. For this purpose he paid a visit\r\nof apparent friendliness to Khlesl; but, when the cardinal returned\r\nthe call, he found himself suddenly seized by Maximilian’s servants,\r\nstripped of his Cardinal’s robe, forced into a carriage, and driven off\r\nto Innsbrück, where he was kept a prisoner till the end of the Bohemian\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nBut there were still other advisers, who claimed to be heard against\r\nthe war. Both in Hungary and Upper Austria, the Estates, though\r\nunwilling to take active part with the Bohemians, urged Matthias to\r\ntake peaceable measures for the restoring of order in Bohemia. In the\r\nMoravian Assembly, a resolution in favour of a similar policy was\r\ncarried by Z̆erotin’s influence; though many of his colleagues would\r\nhave preferred to give more active support to the Bohemians. The\r\nProtestant princes of Germany, however, and particularly the Elector\r\nPalatine, were eager for forcible resistance to Matthias; and a son\r\nof the Margrave of Brandenburg, who was also a prince of Silesia,\r\npersuaded his Silesian colleagues to assist the Bohemians. It was\r\nevident that war could no longer be avoided, and Matthias despatched\r\nCount Bucquoi to Bohemia. Count Mansfeld and the Elector Palatine had\r\nalready sent troops to assist the Protestants; and Bucquoi was so\r\nthoroughly defeated at Lomnice, near Budejóvice, that he urged Matthias\r\nto make peace. The hopes of the Bohemians were further encouraged by\r\nCount Mansfeld’s capture of Pilsen; and Count Thurn resolved to invade\r\nAustria, and to attack Ferdinand at his headquarters. Now, however,\r\nthere arose new difficulties. Tschernembl, indeed, tried to rouse the\r\nAustrians in defence of the Protestant cause; but he found only a very\r\npartial support; while an attempt to persuade the Moravians to assist\r\nthe Bohemian invasion was defeated by the influence of Z̆erotin, who\r\nbitterly denounced Thurn and Ruppa for making a religious movement\r\nthe cover for their political intrigues. These rebuffs impressed on\r\nthe Bohemians the necessity of strengthening their alliances with the\r\nGerman Protestants; and Ruppa sent a message to the Elector Palatine,\r\nto invite him to become king of Bohemia. Frederick V. was unwilling to\r\naccept this proposal. He understood that the Duke of Savoy was likely\r\nto dispute his claim to the Bohemian throne; and he also believed\r\nthat his father-in-law, James I. of England, would object to his\r\nacceptance of that dignity. He did not, however, directly refuse; and\r\nthe necessity for decisive action was still further shown by two deaths\r\nwhich took place about this time; that of the Archduke Maximilian, the\r\none conciliatory member of the House of Hapsburg, and that of the\r\nEmperor Matthias a few months later.\r\n\r\nFerdinand was now face to face with his enemies, without any check\r\nupon his purposes. The alarm among the Protestants was all the greater\r\nfor these events. The Silesian Assembly joined with their princes\r\nin support of Bohemia; Lausitz followed their lead; in spite of the\r\nresistance of Z̆erotin, many of the Moravian nobles also joined the\r\ncause; and the citizens of Jíhlava welcomed Count Thurn into their\r\ntown. Carl von Lichtenstein, who was generally on the winning side,\r\njoined the Protestants in their support of the Bohemians; two attempts\r\non the part of colonels to carry off their troops to Ferdinand met with\r\ncomplete failure; and at last Z̆erotin was put under arrest in his own\r\nhouse, and a provisional government was proclaimed in Moravia, and\r\nentrusted with power to co-operate with the Bohemians. The hopes of the\r\nAustrian Protestants were roused by this new phase of the movement; and\r\nTschernembl at last persuaded the Estates of Upper Austria to declare\r\nin favour of the insurgents.\r\n\r\nThurn’s opportunity now seemed to have come; in May, 1619, he\r\nentered Austria, defeated some of Ferdinand’s forces, and marched to\r\nVienna. But Ferdinand remained undaunted. He summoned before him the\r\nrepresentatives of the Lower Austrian Estates, appealed to their sense\r\nof patriotism, and tried to persuade them to resist the Bohemians. He\r\nhad been arguing in vain for some time, when suddenly the scene was\r\nchanged by the entrance into the Hall of four cornets of horse, who had\r\nbeen secretly summoned by Ferdinand. The resistance of the Protestants\r\nwas suddenly paralysed; and, when Thurn appeared before Vienna the next\r\nday, he found the citizens so unwilling to help him that he was forced\r\nto abandon the siege, and hastened back to defend Bohemia. There the\r\ncontest had continued with various fortune; but it is believed that\r\nBucquoi might soon have carried the day, had not a new ally appeared on\r\nthe Bohemian side.\r\n\r\nBethlen Gabor, the new Prince of Transylvania, saw from the first\r\nthat the success of Ferdinand would naturally lead to those renewed\r\ninvasions of Transylvania which had played so important a part in\r\nthe policy both of Rudolf and Matthias. The Hungarian Assembly had\r\nbeen at first unwilling to co-operate with the Bohemians; but, during\r\nhis expedition to Vienna, Count Thurn had made the acquaintance of\r\na leading Hungarian Protestant, whom he had roused to sympathy with\r\nthe Bohemian cause. When this leader returned to Hungary, he soon\r\nconvinced his friends that the cause of Protestantism was bound up with\r\nthe effort for Bohemian independence; and, when Bethlen Gabor openly\r\ndeclared war on Ferdinand, large districts of Hungary rose on his\r\nbehalf, and he speedily found himself in occupation of Presburg.\r\n\r\nThis encouraging news reached the Bohemians just as they were\r\nentering on one of the most important stages of their movement. The\r\nrepresentatives of all the Bohemian provinces had met at Prague, and,\r\nafter a declaration in favour of the Protestant cause, had formally\r\ndeposed Ferdinand from the throne of Bohemia. Three candidates for\r\nthe throne now offered themselves--the Duke of Savoy, the Elector of\r\nSaxony, and the Elector Palatine of the Rhine. But the first of the\r\nthree had very much cooled in his friendship towards the Bohemian\r\ncause, since he had found that neither France nor England would support\r\nhis claim to the crown. The Elector of Saxony, though popular with a\r\nsmall minority of Bohemians, had never been a zealous supporter of\r\ntheir liberties; and he was suspected of being a tyrannical ruler\r\nin his own dominions. So, on the 26th of August, 1619, the Elector\r\nPalatine of the Rhine was chosen King of Bohemia.\r\n\r\nBut, during the discussions of the Assembly, a sign had been given\r\nwhich might have warned the leaders of the insurrection of one fatal\r\nweakness in their position. The unfortunate peasantry, pressed down\r\nby the burdens of serfdom, greatly feared the additional evils of\r\nwar. They had hoped that the concession of spiritual freedom, which\r\nBudovĕc had won for them, would have been followed by the grant of\r\nother liberties, more directly improving their material position; and\r\nthey were proportionately bitter with their favourite leader, whom\r\nthey accused of deserting them from motives of selfish ambition. They\r\nnow assured the Estates that they could not hope for a blessing on a\r\nmovement which ignored the wrongs of the peasantry. The charge against\r\nBudovĕc seems to have been wholly unjust. He was now past seventy; and,\r\nthough his name was still useful to the leaders of the insurrection,\r\nhis influence on their policy was extremely small. Had it been\r\notherwise, the Council might have taken a different view of this vital\r\nquestion. As it was, the wrongs of the serfs were again ignored; and\r\nnot only did the Protestant leaders lose thereby a popular basis for\r\ntheir movement, but they soon provoked against them a most dangerous\r\nopposition. When the peasantry found that the mercenary troops which\r\nthe Protestants employed were as dangerous to natives as to foreigners,\r\nthey began to think that Ferdinand was preferable to Frederick; and\r\npeasant risings hindered the progress of the Protestant army.\r\n\r\nFrederick, of course, knew nothing as yet of this cause of weakness in\r\nhis new position. Nevertheless, it was with a hesitating mind that he\r\nhad listened to the proposal of the Bohemian Assembly. He had wished\r\nto wait until he could have secured the approval of his father-in-law,\r\nKing James of England; and he knew already that he had to encounter the\r\nopposition of France. A still more dangerous omen for his future career\r\nhad been given only two days after this election. The Electors of the\r\nEmpire on the 28th of August had chosen Ferdinand Emperor of Germany;\r\nand on that occasion the Elector Palatine had been the only one who\r\nvoted in the minority.\r\n\r\nBut two powerful counsellors urged Frederick on to his fate--his wife\r\nElizabeth, and Christian of Anhalt. The latter promised him the support\r\nof the Protestant Union; but, though that support was most welcome,\r\nit was believed in Bohemia that his wife’s opinion had more weight\r\non Frederick’s final decision. Therefore, on September 28, 1619,\r\nhe resolved on accepting the crown, without waiting further for the\r\nopinion of his father-in-law. The victories of Bethlen Gabor doubtless\r\nencouraged Frederick in his dangerous course; and the enthusiasm with\r\nwhich he was received in Prague must have raised his hopes still\r\nfurther. His queen, indeed, though publicly thanked for her influence\r\non his decision, soon became unpopular from her English dress and ways,\r\nand her ignorance of the Bohemian language; but this unpopularity does\r\nnot seem to have affected her husband’s position.\r\n\r\nA more serious difficulty was the inability of the Assembly to raise\r\nmoney for the payment of the troops; an evil which drove the soldiers\r\nto mutiny and robbery, and eventually caused the rising of the peasants\r\nagainst them. These evils the Bohemian Government attempted to meet,\r\npartly by debasement of the coinage, and partly by borrowing money from\r\nforeign powers; but the great hope of the Bohemians still lay in the\r\nsupport of Bethlen Gabor.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after the coronation of Frederick, Bethlen had\r\ninvaded Austria, and was on his march to Vienna. The Austrians were\r\nagain panic-struck; and when the peasantry discovered that they\r\nsuffered as much from the forces of Ferdinand as from the Hungarian\r\narmy, they refused to bestir themselves on the side of the Emperor.\r\nSuddenly, however, the news arrived that a Roman Catholic nobleman,\r\nwho had been defeated by Bethlen in the earlier part of the struggle,\r\nhad now returned to Hungary at the head of a Polish force, and had\r\ngained a signal victory over some of Bethlen’s supporters. Bethlen\r\nthereupon hastened back to Hungary, and Ferdinand hoped to get rid of\r\nthis formidable opponent on moderate terms. But this hope speedily\r\ndisappeared. Bethlen’s return to the scene of action at once restored\r\nsuccess to his supporters. In January, 1620, the Hungarian Assembly\r\nformally deposed Ferdinand, and declared Bethlen Prince of Hungary;\r\nnor could even the acceptance of this election by his deposed rival\r\ndetach Bethlen from the Bohemian cause; and he refused to make terms\r\nwith Ferdinand until the latter had abandoned his claim on Bohemia.\r\nThis encouraged the Bohemians yet further in their resistance; and\r\nthe Austrian Protestants also showed considerable zeal in their\r\ncause. Tschernembl even came to Prague and took an active part in\r\nthe organisation of the war; but he saw plainly that the oppressed\r\ncondition of the peasantry prevented the struggle from assuming that\r\npopular character which alone could make it successful. He therefore\r\nstrongly urged upon his colleagues the abolition of serfdom, as a\r\nmeans of securing the sympathy of the peasantry. But it was one of\r\nthe weaknesses of the movement that the Bohemian nobles were hampered\r\nthroughout by their class prejudices; and Tschernembl’s proposals were\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Ferdinand strengthened his cause by the complete\r\nunion of his forces with those of the Catholic League. Maximilian of\r\nBavaria, the founder of that League, had cherished for some time his\r\nhereditary suspicion and dislike to the House of Austria; and he had\r\nbeen even mentioned as a rival when Ferdinand was first proposed as\r\nEmperor. But the increase of the power of the Protestants gradually\r\nbrought the Catholic rivals together; and towards the end of July,\r\nMaximilian had already consented to assist in suppressing an Austrian\r\nrising. Now, in September, he entered Bohemia; and his general, Tilly,\r\nbecame the chief person in the Imperialist army. This seems to have\r\nbeen the turning-point in the war. Christian of Anhalt, who had joined\r\nthe Bohemian forces, was compelled to retreat to Moravia; while one of\r\nFerdinand’s generals was despatched to Presburg to prevent Bethlen from\r\nmarching to the assistance of the Bohemians. One of the ablest generals\r\non the Bohemian side was Count Mansfeld, a lawless soldier of fortune.\r\nHe, unable to pay his troops, had taken to plundering the Bohemian\r\npeasantry; and, finding that Frederick and Anhalt were both opposed\r\nto this method of warfare, he consented to accept a bribe from the\r\nImperialists, which kept him quiet during their advance to Prague. This\r\nat once led Maximilian to hope for a speedy conquest; and, abandoning\r\nthe siege of Pilsen, Bucquoi and Tilly at once marched forward to\r\nPrague.\r\n\r\nAnhalt, who had been defending Pilsen, hastened to Rakonic, a town\r\nabout thirty miles west of Prague, in order to cut off the advance\r\nof the Imperialists. But, in spite of his energy, the Imperialist\r\nforces came upon the Bohemians at Rakonic before they expected them,\r\nand utterly routed them. Frederick at once lost heart, and sent off\r\na messenger to Elizabeth to tell her to fly from Prague, as all was\r\nlost. But the Queen seems to have inherited something of the courage,\r\nas well as of the beauty, of her unfortunate grandmother, Mary Queen\r\nof Scots; and she indignantly refused to accept this advice. Anhalt\r\nin the meantime had succeeded in rallying his forces, and holding the\r\nImperialists in check before Rakonic. But on the 3rd of November,\r\nMaximilian received a new supply of provisions; and, encouraged by\r\nthis refreshment, the Imperial army once more broke up their camp, and\r\ncontinued their march to Prague. Anhalt again attempted to anticipate\r\ntheir march; and, on the night of the 7th of November, he reached the\r\nWhite Hill, about an hour’s journey from Prague.\r\n\r\nSome of the Hungarian forces, whom Bethlen had previously despatched to\r\nthe aid of the Bohemians, remained at the village of Rusin, at the foot\r\nof the hill; but they were there attacked and driven into flight by the\r\ncavalry of the Imperialists, neither their German nor their Bohemian\r\nallies attempting to rescue them. Again the wretched King of Bohemia\r\nwas seized with a panic; and this time he actually fled from the army,\r\nand did not stop till he reached Prague. Bucquoi desired to leave the\r\nenemy unattacked, and to advance straight to Prague; but Tilly did not\r\nthink it safe to leave Anhalt’s army in the rear; and, while they were\r\nstill discussing the point, Dr. Angelini, a chaplain of Maximilian’s,\r\nexhorted them to fight, as God would protect them. This at once decided\r\nthe Generals; and, as Bucquoi was wounded, Tiefenbach took his place at\r\nthe head of his forces. The first opening of the battle was favourable\r\nto the Bohemians. Count Thurn repelled an attack of the Imperialist\r\ncavalry, and Anhalt followed up this success by advancing in his\r\nturn. But Tilly came to the rescue, drove back Anhalt’s forces, and\r\nstormed the fortifications which had just been erected. Then a complete\r\npanic seized the Protestant army; the soldiers fled in confusion, and\r\nmany were drowned in the Moldau in their endeavour to escape from the\r\nImperialists. Anhalt did his best to rally the fugitives; but he soon\r\nfound that further resistance was hopeless. Tschernembl, indeed, still\r\nwished to defend Prague, and even to organise a new attack; but the\r\nrest of the Council decided to open negotiations with Ferdinand. It\r\nwas resolved, however, that the Queen and her child should at once be\r\nsent away into safety; and Frederick went to make arrangements for\r\nthis purpose. But, with the departure of his wife, the wretched King\r\nhad lost all remains of hope; and, no sooner had he despatched her on\r\nher journey, than he suddenly mounted his horse and galloped off after\r\nher, followed by Ruppa and other members of the Provisional Government.\r\nCount Thurn’s son endeavoured, indeed, to rally his forces once more\r\nfor the defence of the Karlsbrücke; but the soldiers were too terrified\r\nto fight; the Imperialist army entered the town with little resistance;\r\nand on November 23rd Ferdinand received, at Vienna, a chest containing\r\nthe charters of all the Bohemian privileges.\r\n\r\nOf the causes of this final collapse of Bohemian independence there\r\nare three which stand out with special vividness: the first connected\r\nsolely with the events of the insurrection; the second, with the\r\ncondition of Bohemia ever since the fall of Tabor; the third, with\r\na fatal weakness that had reappeared continually through the greater\r\npart of Bohemian history. The first was the character of the leaders\r\nwho undertook to guide this movement. With the exception of Budovĕc and\r\nTschernembl there seem to be none of those heroic figures at the helm\r\nof affairs which are indispensable for a struggle for independence;\r\nand, of these two exceptions, Budovĕc had been speedily thrust into the\r\nbackground by his more ambitious colleagues, and Tschernembl’s advice\r\nwas disregarded in most vital points. Of the rest, Ruppa seems to have\r\nbeen cowardly and colourless; Count Thurn, rash and unscrupulous to the\r\nlast degree; Christian of Anhalt, an ambitious self-seeker; Mansfeld,\r\na mere soldier of fortune, with rather less principle than Dugald\r\nDalgetty; and as for the Elector Palatine, the story has shown how\r\ndeficient he was in every kingly quality.\r\n\r\nThe second cause of weakness was the fatally aristocratic character of\r\nthe movement. The rejection of the petitions of the serfs was in only\r\ntoo faithful harmony with the course of Bohemian history since the fall\r\nof Tabor. The Brotherhood alone had witnessed for wider sympathies\r\nand a higher conception of humanity and religion; but, as we have\r\nseen, even the Brotherhood had often found it difficult to resist the\r\nencroachment of aristocratic principles on its own organisation. The\r\ncry for freedom for a class could not animate a nation to resist the\r\nenthusiasm of sincere bigots like Ferdinand of Austria and Maximilian\r\nof Bavaria, nor the military ability of Tilly.\r\n\r\nThe third error, which hastened the ruin of Bohemia, was the\r\nconnection which the Bohemian leaders had formed with the alien policy\r\nand the unsympathetic schemes of the German intriguers.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Vratislav received his crown from Henry IV., to\r\nthe time when Budovĕc and Thurn called Christian of Anhalt into their\r\ncounsels, this seems to have been the fatal mistake running through\r\nthe history of Bohemia. Doubtless both Vratislav and Vladislav meant\r\nwell by their country, and they secured it a more brilliant position\r\nfor a time; but they involved that country in many wars and disputes\r\nwhich hindered its progress, and which often encouraged unpatriotic\r\nintrigues. Doubtless, too, Wenceslaus and Ottakar promoted the trade\r\nand, for a time, even the freedom of Bohemia, by the introduction of\r\nGerman laws and German settlers into their towns; but this innovation,\r\nintended by them as a development of good government in Bohemia, was\r\neasily perverted by Otto of Brandenburg into a means of new tyranny.\r\nStill more unquestionably well-meant was the attempt of Charles IV.\r\nto combine the greatness of the German Empire with the growth of\r\nculture and learning in Bohemia; but, as unquestionably, it ended in\r\nfailure, and its benefit chiefly consisted in the preparation that it\r\nafforded for the purely Bohemian movement which rose from its ruins.\r\nHus in the fourteenth century, Peter of Chelc̆ic and his followers\r\nin the fifteenth and sixteenth, were the people through whom Bohemia\r\nwas really able to develop a distinctive life, and thereby to do most\r\nessential service to the other nations of Europe; and we shall see,\r\nfrom the fragments of national history which still remain to be told,\r\nthat it is through such representatives as these that Bohemia, even\r\nafter the loss of its political independence, could still do some work,\r\nwhich other countries may be the better for studying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE BATTLE OF THE WHITE HILL TO THE PRESENT TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew crises in the history of a country are so dramatically complete, or\r\nmark so clear a division between past and future, as the Battle of the\r\nWhite Hill. Though Mansfeld still held out for a time in some towns of\r\nBohemia, and though the victories of Gustavus Adolphus in 1631 led to\r\na temporary return of the Protestants, such partial checks could not\r\nhinder the establishment of a stifling despotism, nor remove its traces\r\nwhen established. That Ferdinand II. desired only to crush rebellion,\r\nand to restore the orthodox Roman Catholic faith, may be true enough;\r\nbut he soon found that civil and religious liberty were bound up\r\ntogether, and that a centralised despotism at Vienna was the only means\r\nof securing that outward appearance of orthodoxy which is all that the\r\nmost energetic despot can produce. The first part of his efforts was no\r\ndoubt naturally directed to the punishment of the insurgents. On the\r\n21st of June, 1621, twenty-seven of the leaders of the insurrection\r\nwere executed in the Great Ring of Prague, the noblest and best of\r\nthem being old Wenceslaus of Budova; and many trials, confiscations,\r\nand fines followed, the last of them taking place in 1626.\r\n\r\nBut Ferdinand soon abandoned the pretext of repressing insurrection,\r\nand proceeded to the great work of restoring Catholic orthodoxy. At\r\nfirst his hostility was almost confined to the Protestant preachers,\r\nand his positive schemes were mainly directed to the exaltation of\r\nthe Jesuits. Several preachers had been tortured and killed by the\r\nsoldiers in the first heat of victory, and, in 1621, the great bulk\r\nof the Protestant clergy of Prague were ordered to sell their goods\r\nand to migrate to Saxony. Promises had, indeed, been made to the\r\nElector of Saxony that the Lutherans should be gently dealt with.\r\nModerate terms had been offered to the Utraquists, and Tabor had\r\nonly surrendered on condition of its liberties being secured. But\r\nall these promises were swept aside by the eagerness of the Jesuits\r\nto recover their lost ground. They had been expelled and persecuted\r\nduring the insurrection, and now their turn was come. Gradually all\r\nschools, books, and newspapers were placed under their care. The old\r\nliberties of Charles IV.’s University were crushed out, and at last the\r\nUniversity itself was absorbed in a Jesuit college in which the name of\r\nFerdinand was to be connected with that of Charles. The censorship of\r\nthe press was to be enforced by the careful limitation of the number of\r\nprinting-presses, and by the most rigorous inquiries into faith. Nor\r\nwas the danger left unmarked which might arise from the reverence paid\r\nto the Protestant heroes of the past. The statues of Hus were either\r\ndestroyed or turned into statues of John Nepomuc; Z̆iz̆ka’s dust was\r\ndug up from his grave at C̆aslau, and the figure above it was broken to\r\npieces; a memorial of Rokycana shared the same fate; while the statue\r\nof King George protecting the Cup was removed from the Teyn Church, and\r\na figure of the Virgin substituted for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLACE IN FRONT OF TOWN COUNCIL HOUSE OF PRAGUE WHERE THE\r\nBOHEMIAN NOBLES WERE EXECUTED AFTER THE INSURRECTION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF ST. JOHN NEPOMUC.]\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that no resistance was offered to this\r\nscheme of persecution. Loc̆ika, the preacher at the Teyn Church,\r\npersisted, even in 1622, in administering the Cup to the laity. He was\r\nrebuked for this proceeding; but he appealed to his congregation to\r\nstand by him, and he repeated the offence on the following Sunday.\r\nThen soldiers came into the church to seize him; he escaped by a back\r\ndoor, and a thousand men gathered to defend his house. In spite of this\r\ndefence, however, the soldiers broke into the house and carried Loc̆ika\r\nto prison, where he soon after died.\r\n\r\nMore notable still, in its consequences to Bohemia, was the resistance\r\nof Kutna Hora. Even Ferdinand’s champions and followers had warned\r\nhim that the mining industry was of vital importance to the welfare\r\nof Bohemia, and that it could only be maintained by respecting those\r\npowers of self-government which had been granted for so many centuries\r\nto the miners. But Ferdinand cared little for the material prosperity\r\nof Bohemia. Ever since Z̆iz̆ka had rescued it from Sigismund, Kutna\r\nHora had remained enthusiastically Protestant; and it now offered\r\nspecial resistance to the attempt to Catholicise Bohemia. Ferdinand\r\nresolved at all hazards to crush this opposition. In defiance of the\r\nspecial liberties of the town he quartered soldiers upon it; and, when\r\neven this did not crush its spirit, he sent the Jesuits to celebrate\r\nMass at the church of St. Barbara. Forcible expulsion seemed at last\r\nthe only hope for conversion, and, by the end of 1626, no Protestant\r\nwas left in Kutna Hora. Two hundred and eight out of five hundred and\r\nninety houses were deserted, and the mining industry was ruined in its\r\nchief centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF ST. BARBARA AT KUTNA HORA.]\r\n\r\nBut there was one Protestant whose claims to consideration even\r\nFerdinand could not deny. Charles of Z̆erotin had stood faithfully\r\nby the king at the height of the insurrection, and he had sacrificed\r\nposition, and suffered imprisonment, in his cause. Ferdinand had\r\npromised to respect his convictions, and not to interfere with the\r\nProtestants who resided on his estate. Z̆erotin, therefore, was\r\nnaturally indignant when he found the Commissioners of Cardinal\r\nDietrichstein carrying out, on his lands, their schemes for the\r\nsuppression of Protestant worship. He hastened to Vienna and warmly\r\nremonstrated with the Emperor on his breach of faith. Ferdinand\r\nadmitted the promises which he had given, and the services which he\r\nhad received from Z̆erotin; but he said that the Pope was his master\r\nin matters of conscience, and the Pope had forbidden him to keep his\r\npromises. Z̆erotin was not satisfied with this answer. He hastened back\r\nto his own estate, and found that the Commissioners had just closed\r\na Protestant church and sealed up the doors. Z̆erotin indignantly\r\ntore off the seal, re-opened the church, and took under his special\r\nprotection several of the preachers who had fled from other districts.\r\nA Bohemian nobleman named George Sabovsky followed Z̆erotin’s example;\r\nand thus, both in Bohemia and Moravia, Protestantism was still kept\r\nalive in certain small districts.\r\n\r\nFerdinand now saw that it was not only the preachers whom he had to\r\nfear; and that to attack the clergy and destroy the privileges of\r\ntowns, while he spared the nobles, was an extremely inadequate policy.\r\nHe therefore now issued decrees, which were partly aimed against the\r\nlanded proprietors, partly against Protestants of every class. In 1624\r\nProtestants were forbidden to register their lands in that Land Court\r\nwhich alone secured them a good title to their estates; their children\r\nmight not inherit the lands of their fathers unless they deserted\r\ntheir fathers’ faith; and marriages between Protestants and Catholics\r\nwere to be no longer recognised. Even these remedies failed. Z̆erotin\r\nstill openly defied the royal Commissioners; and at last, in 1627,\r\nall Protestants were ordered to sell their estates and to leave the\r\ncountry, under pain of severe punishments.\r\n\r\nBut, before this climax had been reached, Ferdinand had discovered how\r\nhopelessly entangled with each other were the principles of civil and\r\nof religious liberty. He had wished merely to Catholicise Bohemia; in\r\norder to effect this, he now found that he must crush out its national\r\nfeeling and its constitutional liberties. The towns had resisted him,\r\ntherefore the towns must be deprived of their charters. The Land\r\nCourt might evade the decisions against Protestant registration;\r\nthe decisions of the Land Court must in future be overruled by the\r\nking. The Estates might make Protestant laws, and refuse to vote\r\nnecessary taxes for his wars; their power must therefore be practically\r\nsuppressed; the king must be allowed to re-model the Constitution,\r\nto appoint officials, to raise forces, and to levy taxes, without\r\ninterference from any other authority. Nay, might not Prague rise,\r\nagain, against his authority? Therefore the king must carry off the\r\nBohemian crown to Vienna, and govern Bohemia by the advice of Austrian\r\ncouncillors. Even in that most tender point, his language, the Bohemian\r\nwas to receive severe wounds. Ferdinand, indeed, had talked only of\r\nequalising the German and Bohemian languages in the practice of the law\r\ncourts; but, as German officials and judges gradually took the place\r\nof Bohemians, and as a German aristocracy rapidly rose on the ruins of\r\nthe exiled Bohemian nobles, this equalisation steadily developed into\r\nthe exaltation of German at the expense of Bohemian, while, in the\r\nUniversity and the schools, both these living languages gave way before\r\nthe Latin of the Jesuits. The study of history and physical science\r\nalmost died out. Trade steadily decayed, and the population of the\r\ncountry diminished.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, in such a period as this, the real history of\r\nBohemia should be rather studied in the lives of its exiles, than in\r\nthe dreary records of its home life. Fortunately, one can find among\r\nthese exiles a man who is trebly interesting to the historian; first,\r\nas embodying the highest ideal then possible to a Bohemian; secondly,\r\nas linking together, in a remarkable manner, the earlier and later\r\nstages of the Bohemian Brotherhood; thirdly, as one of the founders of\r\nthe modern methods of education. John Amos Komensky (better known by\r\nhis Latin name of Comenius) was born at Nivnice in Moravia in 1592. His\r\nfather and mother died early, and the guardians, to whose care he was\r\nleft, are said to have neglected their charge. However, he was sent\r\nto the school of the Brotherhood at Prerov, where he soon developed a\r\ngreat love of learning; and, at the age of thirty-two, he was appointed\r\nby Charles of Z̆erotin to the headship of the school in which he had\r\nformerly studied. He soon became impressed with the unsatisfactory\r\ncharacter of the accepted methods of teaching Latin; and he suggested\r\nan easier and simpler plan. From Prerov he was removed to Fulnec, the\r\noldest Moravian settlement of the Brotherhood; but, before he could\r\ncarry his reforms any further, he was interrupted in his work by\r\nthe Bohemian insurrection. In 1621 a Spanish army burnt Fulnec; and\r\nall Comenius’s books and manuscripts were destroyed. In the time of\r\npersecution he, like other preachers of the Brotherhood, took refuge\r\nwith Charles of Z̆erotin. The sufferings and uncertainties of his life\r\nnaturally turned his attention to theological and moral problems, and\r\nhis first important book took the form of an allegory. In this he\r\ndescribes a journey through scenes of vanity and confusion, ending\r\nin the return to the inner life, and the realisation of a stronger\r\nsympathy with the poor and suffering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN AMOS KOMENSKY.]\r\n\r\nBut the final expulsion of the Protestants from Bohemia brought\r\nComenius back to the real work of his life. He and other members of the\r\nBrotherhood now formed a kind of colony at Lissa in Poland. In that\r\ntown he resumed his profession of schoolmaster, and he once more became\r\nvividly conscious of the defects in existing methods of education. In\r\n1631 he published the book which embodies his strongest convictions on\r\nthese matters--“Janua aurea reserrata quatuor linguarum.” In this book\r\nhe points out that “boys are being stuffed with the names of things\r\nwithout the things.” The boy learns to recite by heart a thousand\r\nwords; if he does not know how to apply them to things, of what use\r\nwill all this provision of words be? Moreover, the books chosen are\r\ntoo restricted in their character; and, however excellent in quality,\r\nthey do not deal with nearly all the subjects which a boy should learn.\r\nComenius therefore proposes to arrange sentences in four languages\r\n(Latin, German, French, and Italian). These sentences deal with a\r\nlarge variety of subjects, ranging from the creation of the world to\r\nthe mechanical arts and the practice of the law-courts; and they are\r\nfollowed by a vocabulary of the most necessary words. Comenius, indeed,\r\nvery generously admitted that the Jesuits had made a useful beginning\r\nin this matter of the vocabulary; but he did not consider that their\r\nvocabulary was complete enough for his purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a later book called the “Didactica,” he further explained his\r\nprinciples. The intellect, he urged, should be developed before mere\r\nlanguage is taught. Language should be learnt from authors, rather\r\nthan from grammatical rules. Things should be taught before organisms;\r\nexamples before rules. Pictures should be largely used to bring out the\r\nmeaning of the teacher; and children should not be forced to commit\r\nto memory what they do not understand. The first teaching should be\r\ngiven in the vernacular; the Latin equivalents should be learnt later.\r\n“Nature,” said Comenius, “cannot be forced, but must be led willingly.\r\nAll the senses must be called into play by the lesson; and the later\r\nlessons should be the natural development of the earlier ones. Whatever\r\nis to be known should be taught. Whatever is taught should be taught as\r\na present thing of definite use.”\r\n\r\nComenius had now gained a high reputation in the Brotherhood; and he\r\nwas chosen to write the history of its trials and sufferings. At the\r\nsame time his educational works had attracted attention outside his\r\nown circle, and Gustavus Adolphus invited him to Sweden, to reform the\r\nschools in that country. This invitation Comenius at first refused;\r\nbut, ten years later, when his books were in a more advanced condition,\r\nhe accepted a proposal, of a somewhat similar kind, from another\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hartlib, a merchant of London, had been much interested in the\r\nworks of Comenius; and, in his desire to reform English education,\r\nhe invited the Bohemian to come over to London. Hartlib had shown\r\ngreat liberality to the Bohemian exiles; and Comenius had already\r\nbeen interested in several English books. Moreover, one of his own\r\nbooks had been written at Hartlib’s suggestion, and published, at\r\nHartlib’s own expense, in London. Comenius, therefore, decided to\r\naccept this invitation, and he arrived in London in the critical year\r\n1641. The Long Parliament readily responded to Hartlib’s proposals;\r\nand they voted money for the founding of three colleges, in which the\r\nprinciples of Comenius might at once be applied. One of these was to\r\nbe at the Savoy, one at Chelsea, and one at Winchester. Unfortunately,\r\nthe Irish insurrection turned the attention of Parliament away from\r\nthese matters; and the rapid succession of events, which culminated\r\nin the civil war, convinced the Bohemian that there was no further\r\npossibility, at that time, for the development of his purposes in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut, though Comenius left our country in some disappointment, it must\r\nbe remembered that he left one very eminent disciple behind him.\r\nFour years later, when the hopes of the Puritans had gained further\r\nstrength, Hartlib appealed to Milton to second him in the promotion of\r\nhis schemes. Milton turned, somewhat unwillingly, from the composition\r\nof the Areopagitica to the discussion of Hartlib’s plans; but he was\r\nimpressed by his friend’s enthusiasm; and it is evidently of Comenius\r\nthat he speaks so warmly in his letter. He there describes him as “a\r\nperson sent hither by some good Providence from a far country, to be\r\nthe occasion and incitement of great good to this Island.” Though,\r\ntherefore, the poet had not time “to search out what many modern Januas\r\nand Didactics, more than ever I shall read, have projected,” he yet\r\nconsented in this letter to express his sympathy with the plans of\r\nComenius and Hartlib. The following words, perhaps, best sum up his\r\nteaching. “If, after some preparatory grounds of speech, by their\r\ncertain forms got into memory, children were led to the praxis thereof,\r\nin some chosen short book lessened thoroughly to them, they might then\r\nlearn the substance of good things and arts in due order, which would\r\nbring the whole language quickly into their power.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Comenius, eager for those spheres of work, had\r\naccepted a second invitation to Sweden, this time from a Swedish\r\nnobleman named De Geer. The famous Chancellor, Oxenstierna, readily\r\nwelcomed the Bohemian to Sweden; though, at the same time, he\r\ncomplained that previous educational reformers had pointed out faults\r\nwithout suggesting remedies. When Comenius produced his schemes, the\r\nChancellor subjected them to a searching criticism; and, finding that\r\nComenius was ready to meet his objections, he consented to place the\r\nreform of Swedish education under his guidance. Comenius, however,\r\nultimately chose the Prussian town of Elbing as the centre of his\r\nexperiments; probably because he was there nearer to the settlements\r\nof the Brotherhood, and could intervene at times to mitigate their\r\nquarrels or intercede for their rights.\r\n\r\nThe relation of literary patron to protected man of genius has never\r\nbeen an easy or a happy one; and Comenius often found that De Geer\r\ncomplained of the slowness of his work, and, still more, perhaps,\r\nof that wide range of sympathies which often distracted him from the\r\ninterests to which his patron desired him to confine himself. Once De\r\nGeer even withdrew his support, for a time, from the needy Bohemian;\r\nand Comenius must have felt this desertion the more keenly, because his\r\napplications for money had been far oftener made on behalf of others\r\nthan for his own needs. But a bitterer blow awaited him in 1648. He had\r\nhoped that the enthusiasm of Gustavus Adolphus for the Protestant Cause\r\nhad been shared by his Councillors, and by his countrymen generally;\r\nand that they would insist on the restoration of the Protestant\r\nBohemians to their country, before the final conclusion of the peace.\r\nIt was, therefore, a terrible shock to find that Oxenstierna cared\r\nmore for the possession of Pomerania than for the liberties of German\r\nor Bohemian Protestants; and Comenius bitterly reproached the Swedish\r\nChancellor with his desertion of the cause of the exiles.\r\n\r\nBut this year of disappointment brought one consolation. Comenius was\r\nelected Chief Bishop of the Bohemian Brotherhood; and his exhortations\r\nand encouragements seemed for a time to put new life into the Society.\r\nMore noteworthy still is the effect which these addresses produced in\r\nthe following century; for it was they that decided Count Zinzendorf\r\nto welcome the Brethren to Herrnhut, and to inaugurate that later\r\nperiod of their career during which they have been known by the name\r\nof “Moravians.” It is interesting, too, to find that Comenius was\r\nactuated by that Slavonic feeling which was always so powerful in\r\nBohemia; and that he conceived the idea of translating the Bible\r\ninto Turkish, so that, by turning the Sultan to the true faith,\r\nhe might secure an easier life for those Slavs who were suffering\r\nunder the Mahommedan tyranny. His educational labours were also\r\ncarried on with some effect in Poland and Hungary; and it should be\r\nspecially remembered that the German Real-Schule is as much due to the\r\ninspiration of Comenius as the Universities of Leipzic and Wittenberg\r\nare to the model provided for them, and the scholars trained in the\r\nUniversity of Prague.\r\n\r\nBut, though the career of Comenius shows that there were still\r\nBohemians who tried to keep alive the intellectual and moral life of\r\ntheir nation, such instances are but rare interruptions to the dreary\r\nrecord of stifling tyranny which stretched over the last years during\r\nwhich the male line of the Hapsburgs governed Bohemia. Doubtless,\r\noccasionally, energetic students, like the Jesuits, Balbin and Pes̆ina,\r\ngive hopes of an ultimate revival of interest in the national history;\r\nsometimes an insurrection of the peasantry, like that of 1680, seems to\r\nhint that tyranny may become intolerable at last. Joseph I., indeed,\r\nis credited with a desire for reform; but at any rate there is no sign\r\nof a realisation of his ideas; and it is only when the male Hapsburgs\r\nmake way for the one female ruler of their race that a day of better\r\nthings seems just about to dawn. Even that dawn was very slow in\r\nbreaking. Some encouragement was given to culture by Maria Theresa,\r\nand a literary society was founded; but it soon became apparent that\r\neven literary discussions involved an awkward revival of the past;\r\nand the censors again interfered to check intellectual progress. The\r\nEmpress-Queen relaxed the feudal oppression of the peasantry; but\r\nonly enough was granted to excite, without satisfying, the desire for\r\nliberty. One step, however, was gained during this reign, which cleared\r\nthe ground for future progress. Popes and kings at last realised\r\nthat that great Order, before which they had bowed, might become as\r\ndangerous to them as to the people whom they governed; and, in 1773,\r\nClement XIV. dissolved the Society of Jesus. This dissolution struck a\r\nblow at that monopoly of education which had stunted the intellectual\r\nlife of Bohemia, and it prepared the way for the changes of the\r\nfollowing reign.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, Joseph II. of Germany, the first king of the House of\r\nLorraine, succeeded his mother as ruler of all the dominions of\r\nthe House of Austria. He at once signalised his accession to power\r\nby an Edict of Toleration, which allowed all Protestants to return\r\nto Bohemia, and to settle there freely. But, with all his zeal\r\nfor enlightenment, Joseph was hampered by those old traditions of\r\nuniformity which he had received from his mother’s family. He soon\r\nfound that Protestants could not be all rolled together in compact\r\nbundles and kept quiet there. Not only the Bohemian Brothers, but a\r\nnumber of very strange sects, would come in under the new Edict. Some\r\nof these did not even profess Christianity; and Joseph was yet more\r\nirritated to find that men who had special convictions sometimes wished\r\nto express them in ways of which their neighbours disapproved. The\r\nProtestants were therefore called upon to accept either the Augsburg\r\nConfession or the Calvinistic Formulæ; and, when he at last realised\r\nthat there was a growing body in the country who refused to accept\r\nany definite Christian creed, Joseph’s feelings of toleration gave\r\nway. Children were torn from their parents to be educated in sounder\r\nprinciples, and the parents were banished to Transylvania.\r\n\r\nA blot, that created even more general indignation in Bohemia, stained\r\nJoseph’s schemes of educational reform. Here, too, he wished to remove\r\nrestrictions and to extend knowledge; but here again the Hapsburg\r\ninstinct was too strong for eighteenth-century enlightenment. The\r\nLatin of the Jesuits was, indeed, to be deposed from its supremacy.\r\nPrinting-presses were to be established. Studies previously rejected\r\nwere to be encouraged. But the tyranny of Latin only made way for the\r\ntyranny of German. _That_ was to be the one recognised language of\r\neducation; and Bohemian was to yield to it even more completely than it\r\nhad yielded to the language of an older civilisation.\r\n\r\nNor had Parliaments or municipalities any chance of life. No laws\r\nwere to be passed by the Bohemian Estates without the sanction of an\r\nAustrian Board; the censorship of Bohemian books was to be conducted\r\nfrom Vienna; a brand-new municipal code was to check the free play of\r\nthe old Town Rights. Only in one matter was freedom to be unhampered in\r\nits progress, and untainted by any of those inconsistent arrangements\r\nwhich took back with one hand what the other hand had given. The\r\npower of the lord over the serf was to be completely broken; and the\r\nfreed peasants might move as they pleased from place to place, and\r\nmight choose whatever trade or study they desired, unhampered by the\r\nauthority of their former masters.\r\n\r\nBut the opposition to the denationalising plans of Joseph, which\r\nassumed so violent a form in Hungary and the Netherlands, encouraged\r\nthe Bohemians also to protest in a milder fashion; and, when Leopold\r\nsucceeded Joseph as King of Bohemia, he was forced to reconsider his\r\nbrother’s policy, to convoke the Bohemian Assembly once more, and to\r\nmake concessions to the national feeling in the matter of language.\r\nFor, in spite of all repressions and discouragements, that feeling\r\nhad never ceased to have its influence in Bohemia; and it was well\r\nillustrated by three men of very different type, who had begun their\r\nefforts in the discouraging times of repression, and who lived on into\r\nmore hopeful days.\r\n\r\nOf these the eldest was Frantis̆ek Pelc̆el, who was born at Rychnov\r\n(Reichenau) in 1735. He was a man of obscure birth, and he was intended\r\nby his parents for the medical profession. But he did not like this\r\noccupation; so he went to Prague to study in the High School, where he\r\npartly supported himself by teaching the children of rich citizens.\r\nFinding, however, that logic was better taught at Králové Dvůr\r\n(Königinhof), he went there to study; but, while he was there, the\r\nschool was placed more completely under Jesuit control. The strange\r\nmixture of repulsion and attraction which that wonderful Society seems\r\ngenerally to excite in its pupils, had its influence over Pelc̆el; and\r\nthe attraction proving, for the time, the stronger feeling, he was\r\ninclined to give himself to theology; but the Seven Years War cut short\r\nhis studies, and he left Bohemia for Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt was on his return to Prague that he fell in with the second of the\r\nmen who were to be the great promoters of the new movement. This was\r\nCount Caspar of Sternberg, the son of an officer who had served under\r\nMaria Theresa. He, like Pelc̆el, had been attracted to the study of\r\ntheology; but his audacious speculations had startled the professors\r\nat the German College in Rome, and the Jesuits had produced on him a\r\npurely repellent effect. After the dissolution of the German College,\r\nSternberg had returned to Prague, and had given himself to the study of\r\nart. He soon took notice of Pelc̆el, and entrusted to him the education\r\nof his children. This turned Pelc̆el from his theological speculations;\r\nbut it was not till his transfer to the family of another nobleman that\r\nhe devoted himself wholly to the study and writing of history. His life\r\nof Charles IV. and his short history of Bohemia may be wanting in the\r\nwide views and deeper insight of later historians; but the evidence of\r\nenormous industry and hearty interest in the subject make a distinct\r\nmark in the progress of national feeling.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of the leaders of the movement, and the one who\r\nseems to be the most looked back to by the historians of the present\r\nday, was Josef Dobrovsky. He, too, was intended by his Jesuit teachers\r\nfor a theological career; and it was only the suppression of that\r\nOrder which turned him for a time to the study of the language. He did\r\nnot, however, abandon theology. In 1778 he brought out a commentary on\r\nBohemian literature; and in 1779 he began to edit a journal in which\r\ncontemporary Bohemian literature was noticed and criticised. Curiously\r\nenough, his conclusions about Bohemian history were rather opposed to\r\nthose of modern national historians. He threw doubts on the existence\r\nof the common Slavonic language; and he rather discredited the extent\r\nof the influence of Cyril and Methodius, as compared with that of the\r\nRoman Church. But for the Bohemian language he was keenly zealous, and\r\nwhen, in 1790, Leopold appeared at a meeting of the Bohemian Society\r\nof Sciences, Dobrovsky appealed to him to protect his countrymen in\r\nthe use of their mother-tongue. The Emperor was so much impressed by\r\nthis appeal, that he sent six thousand gulden to the society, for\r\nthe promotion of journeys for inquiry into the Bohemian history and\r\nlanguage. Dobrovsky was chosen to travel in Sweden and Russia, both\r\nfor the recovery of lost manuscripts and for the collection of further\r\ninformation about Slavonic literature.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Count Caspar von Sternberg had been forced to abandon\r\nofficial life, and had begun to devote himself more exclusively to\r\nthe promotion of art, literature, and science. The Emperor Francis\r\nshowed himself almost as friendly as Leopold had been to the revival\r\nof Bohemian literature and art; and, in 1818, he assented to the\r\nfoundation of the National Museum at Prague for the collection of all\r\nkinds of literary, artistic, and scientific antiquities of Bohemia. The\r\nfoundation of this museum was almost contemporaneous with events which\r\nexcited, to the highest pitch, the champions of Bohemian language and\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nA man named Hanka, in hunting for some ecclesiastical documents in the\r\nvault of the church of Králové Dvůr, found an old chest in the wall,\r\nin which church ornaments were kept. Hidden behind this were some\r\ncurious old manuscripts, which, on examination, proved to be Bohemian\r\nsongs of a comparatively early date. They were at once despatched to\r\nPrague, and were handed over by Count Sternberg to two men who were now\r\ngaining much reputation. These were Josef S̆afarik, a Slovak from that\r\ndistrict of Hungary where a dialect of the Bohemian language is usually\r\nspoken, and Frantis̆ek Palacký, the son of a Calvinist minister, who\r\nhad been marked out for an important post in the new museum. They\r\nexamined the manuscript, and, after long consideration, pronounced it\r\ngenuine. This discovery seemed to open a new world of life and thought\r\nto the champions of national literature. Most of the songs, it was\r\ntrue, dealt mainly with battles; but the power of expression seemed to\r\nindicate a condition of culture in the ninth or tenth century which\r\nled the Bohemians to believe in an early development of national life,\r\nuninfluenced by Teutonic intruders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLOVAK WOMAN FOUND IN PARTS OF MORAVIA AND ALSO IN\r\nHUNGARY.]\r\n\r\nCount Sternberg now issued an appeal to the possessors of all\r\nantiquities, whether literary, artistic, or scientific, to send them\r\nto the National Museum. One of the first answers to this appeal was\r\nan anonymous letter, in which the writer announced that he had\r\ndiscovered another Bohemian manuscript in a certain castle; but that\r\nhe feared to give his name or call public attention to the place, as\r\nthe owner of the castle was a German “Michel”[6] who would destroy any\r\nBohemian manuscript if he found it. The writer, therefore, forwarded\r\nthe manuscript secretly, without waiting for the lord’s permission.\r\nThe manuscript was found to be the poem of the Libus̆in Saud described\r\nin the first chapter of this history; and the writer, on inquiry,\r\nwas discovered to be Kovar, the bailiff of Count Colloredo-Mansfeld.\r\nThe manuscript, it appeared, had been discovered in a vault of the\r\nCastle of Zelená hora (Grünberg), in Nepomuc, where the bailiff had\r\nbeen examining a number of business papers. This manuscript was also\r\nexamined, and was pronounced by Palacký and S̆afarik to be of earlier\r\ndate than the Königinhof manuscript.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries, however, were not suffered to pass unchallenged.\r\nAt first, indeed, the controversy seemed likely to be conducted on\r\nscientific principles. The chief opponent of their authenticity was\r\nthe zealous patriot Dobrovsky; and he disputed their claim to historic\r\nworth on philological grounds. But soon the controversy passed out\r\nof the serene air of scientific discussion. The eager enthusiasm\r\nwith which most Bohemian patriots had hailed the discovery of the\r\nmanuscripts, aroused an equally eager desire on the part of the enemies\r\nof their language to dispute the authenticity of these discoveries; and\r\nsavage German critics accused Hanka and Kovar of forgery, and denounced\r\nas absurd the suggestion of any possible Bohemian civilisation which\r\nhad not come from Germany. The writings of S̆afarik on the various\r\nSlavonic languages kept the discussion alive; and the appearance, in\r\n1836, of the early volumes of Palacký’s history roused still angrier\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOHEMIAN WOMAN WITH “DOVE” HEAD-DRESS AND NATIVE WORK.]\r\n\r\nEven before this literary revival had taken place, discoveries had\r\nbeen made which seemed to point to an early culture even amongst the\r\nBohemian peasantry. Bronzes and earthenware ornaments had been dug up,\r\nthe antiquity of which was proved by the heathen symbols marked upon\r\nthem; and it was noticed that these devices corresponded to the designs\r\nwhich were produced in later ages by the peasantry in Bohemia and\r\nMoravia. This curious fact gave a new impulse to investigation, and\r\nnumerous specimens of the peasant art were collected. The beauty of\r\ncolouring and design in this work is the more striking because it was\r\nnot learnt in any school, but is the fruit of native genius. About the\r\nsame time a similar interest was roused in the music produced by the\r\npeasantry, and the songs and dances of the peasants have been embodied\r\nin the operas of S̆metana.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1848 naturally brought to a head the struggle between\r\nthe Germans and Bohemians: and the demand then made for the further\r\nprotection of the Bohemian language was strengthened at a later stage\r\nby the meeting of the Slavonic Congress, which was to protect the Slavs\r\nagainst the threatened encroachment of the Frankfort Parliament.[7] The\r\nunfortunate rising of June, 1848, led to the downfall of the newly-born\r\nliberty of Bohemia; but, when German and Magyar revolutions were alike\r\ncrushed, questions of race-division naturally ceased for a time to be\r\ninteresting to those who had suffered a common loss of liberty. The\r\nidea of a federative union of the Austrian dominions was, however, kept\r\nsteadily before the public by Palacký; and the old fear of sinking to\r\nan equality with other races gradually roused the Germans to renewed\r\naction. In 1858 the controversy about the manuscripts of Králové Dvůr\r\nand Zelená hora was renewed in all its fierceness; and when, after the\r\nAustrian collapse in 1859, the talk about Constitutional government\r\nonce more began, it was soon found that the new liberties were not to\r\nproduce equality of race. The wars of 1866 and 1870 gave a new impulse\r\nto the German claim for supremacy in Austria; and so the struggle has\r\ngone on with varying fortune, but ever circling round the central point\r\nof language and literature.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The following account of the legend of Libus̆a is taken partly from\r\nthe translation of the Libus̆in Saud by Mr. A. H. Wratislaw, partly\r\nfrom the version of the story given by Cosmas. I have not the least\r\ndesire to enter here into the burning question of the authenticity of\r\nthe original poem. I have heard every degree and variety of opinion on\r\nthat subject, even from patriotic Bohemians. But the only two points\r\nthat concern me here are, first, that Cosmas must have had before him\r\nsome old legend containing a version of the story, not unlike that\r\nedited and translated by Mr. Wratislaw; secondly, that Cosmas accepted\r\nthis story as embodying his conception of the beginnings of Bohemian\r\nhistory. No one, as far as I know, disputes the genuineness of Cosmas’s\r\nhistory; into the sources of his information it is not necessary to go.\r\n\r\n[2] A new word in the Bohemian language fitly marks this period. This\r\nword is _Kostel_, which is obviously formed from the German _Castell_,\r\nand ultimately from _Castellum_; but which was used to signify church,\r\nsince the military Christianity introduced by the Franks was marked by\r\nthe use of castles as churches.\r\n\r\n[3] In the English carol the story has evidently been adapted to modern\r\nfeeling; for the saint’s barefoot walk to the church has been changed\r\ninto a mission of practical benevolence.\r\n\r\n[4] Since writing the above I have found a curious confirmation of\r\nmy opinion of the danger of this utterance in one of the decrees of\r\nFerdinand II., issued at the time when he was practically destroying\r\nthe foundation of Charles IV. He appeals to the memory of Charles as\r\na justification of his proceedings, on the ground that he was only\r\nrestoring that unity of the Catholic religion, of which Charles was so\r\nardent a champion.\r\n\r\n[5] These words are curiously like those of a later popular ruler of\r\nRome--“Mankind has worshipped in the name of the Father and the Son.\r\nGive place to the religion of the Spirit.”--_From the Pope to the\r\nCouncil._--GIUSEPPE MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n[6] “Michel” is an embodiment of certain ideas about the typical\r\nGerman, much as the name “John Bull” embodies certain conceptions about\r\nthe average Englishman.\r\n\r\n[7] I have treated this part of the subject in full in my account of\r\nthe Bohemian Revolution in the “Revolutions of 1848 and 1849.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Adalbert, his early career, 30;\r\n    his influence as Bishop of Prague, 30;\r\n    his flight from Prague, 31;\r\n    his conversion of the
