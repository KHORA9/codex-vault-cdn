Study was an essential duty which took many hours. During the\r\n war years there were responsibilities connected with the operation of\r\n hospitals for the wounded. Always over the Family hung the fear of the\r\n possible demise of the heir to the throne, the young Tsesarevich and\r\n Grand Duke Alexei Nicholaevich, who had inherited haemophilia through\r\n his Mother.\r\n\r\n The Grand Duchess Anastasia rejects vigorously various accusations\r\n directed against each of her parents. She explains in her preface the\r\n reasons for her long submergence and for her present re-emergence\r\n forty-five years after her reported death.\r\n\r\n Her style is brisk and invigorating. Her sense of humor repeatedly\r\n delights with accounts of lighter events and anecdotes.\r\n\r\n This is an invaluable historical record.\r\n\r\n                    ROBERT SPELLER & SONS, Publishers\r\n                           33 West 42nd Street\r\n                          New York, N.Y. 10036\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Photograph by Stephen Gaillard_      _Portrait by Richard Banks_\r\n\r\nH.I.H.

First of all\r\nmust be mentioned the late Mrs. Helen Kohlsaat Wells, a close friend\r\nand confidante for many, many years. She worked with me closely during\r\nthe years 1930 to 1934 during which we completed the first complete\r\ndraft of the manuscript. Many years later we worked intermittently on\r\nrevising the manuscript until Mrs. Wells’ untimely death. Also in a\r\nseparate category is the late Mr. John Adams Chapman, whose friendship\r\nand counsel were so valuable at all times. Deserving of special\r\ngratitude are Mrs. Marjorie Wilder Emery, Miss Edith Kohlsaat, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Norman Hanson, Mrs. John Adams Chapman, Mr. and Mrs. Louis\r\nEllsworth Laflin, Jr., and Mr. and Mrs. Francis Beidler II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\n\r\n  List of Illustrations                                  xi\r\n  Author’s Preface

I had had time to\r\nrecover from the emotional and nervous shock and body wounds which I\r\nhad suffered at the time of the tragedy on the night of July 16-17,\r\n1918--I decided to write about my home life with my beloved family,\r\nabout our arrest, about our exile in Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg, about\r\nthe assassination of the family in Ekaterinburg, and about my rescue\r\nand subsequent escape across the frontier.\r\n\r\nI made many, many notes, totaling over three hundred pages. I spent\r\nhours and hours in the writing, days and nights of introspective\r\nexperiences, of grief and horror. I wrote in a peasant cottage in a\r\nlonely village dotted with thatched-roof houses. I wrote at night in\r\nthe candlelight, agonizing over my story. At times the only relief I\r\nhad from my misery was the howling or barking of a dog. I remembered my\r\nbeloved Father’s words, “Dearest children, are you awake?” Tear after\r\ntear dropped as I labored.\r\n\r\nI remembered also my Father’s desire that a history of Russia should\r\nbe written by a member of our family. My Father had had in mind that\r\nsuch a history might be written by my two oldest sisters and, to that\r\nend, he gave them much valuable information. As it has turned out, it\r\nis the youngest sister, the one least prepared to do so, upon whom\r\ndevolves the task of writing such a book, if it is to be written. That\r\nis something for the future.\r\n\r\nIn 1918, after my escape, I thought that the book I had decided to\r\nwrite about my family and myself might include historical data and\r\ninterpretation which would be of interest to the world and would be\r\nof benefit to the Russian people and to their, and my, native land. I\r\nparticularly wanted to let the world know the facts about the arrest,\r\nexile and murder of my parents, sisters and brother, and about the\r\nnature of the Bolshevik regime in my country. It was the notes for this\r\nbook that I produced so painfully and painstakingly.\r\n\r\nThese early notes unfortunately vanished in 1919 when I was on my way\r\nby train from Rumania to Serbia--second homeland to us Russians--while\r\nin the vicinity of Turnu-Severin. I had accepted from another\r\ntraveller--I thought he was an Italian--his kind offer of a slice of\r\nbread and a piece of ham. Three or four hours later I became ill and\r\nhad to leave the compartment. When I returned some time later, the\r\nheartless traveller, who had no pity for a young woman travelling\r\nalone, had disappeared along with my suitcase and a blanket. The\r\nsuitcase contained not only my precious notes, so laboriously produced,\r\nbut also some personal belongings, some letters, and a list of about\r\none hundred names of the men who had done most of the harm to Russia,\r\nand to my family. These names I had written down from memory, based\r\nupon information furnished by my rescuer, Alexander. Most of these\r\nnames were already familiar to me.\r\n\r\nIn Yugoslavia, I resumed work on my book. I continued the task later\r\nin Rumania and, once more, in Yugoslavia. I again wrote many pages of\r\nnotes, using a pencil stub and scraps of paper. Such of these notes as\r\nremained legible were used subsequently in the preparation of the first\r\ndraft of the present book.\r\n\r\nLater, in the early thirties, some years after my arrival in the United\r\nStates, I began to revise my materials which were in a disorganized but\r\ngenerally readable condition, assisted by my good friends, the late\r\nMrs. Helen Kohlsaat Wells, and her sister, Miss Edith Kohlsaat. During\r\nthis phase of the undertaking I was determined to complete the book as\r\nsoon as possible and to make provision for its publication only after\r\nmy own demise.\r\n\r\nFor about twenty years, I was unable to work on the manuscript, due\r\nto the necessity of making my own living. During this period I gave\r\nno attention whatever to the manuscript which I had confided for\r\nsafekeeping to my lawyer, a friend who was aware of my real identity\r\nand who wished to help me ultimately to find a publisher.\r\n\r\nFive or six years ago I decided to resume work on the book. A complete\r\nrevision and reorganization of my materials were again required. Once\r\nmore I had the benefit of Helen Wells’ assistance and counsel.\r\n\r\nI had also the great and valued encouragement of my good friends the\r\nlate John Adams Chapman and Mrs. Marjorie Wilder Emery.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1963 I mentioned to a friend in New York, who was unaware of\r\nmy identity, that I had in my possession a manuscript on the Russian\r\nRevolution. He suggested I get in touch with a close friend, Dr. Jon\r\nP. Speller of Robert Speller & Sons, Publishers, Inc. This I did.\r\nThe first member of the firm with whom I talked was Mr. Robert E. B.\r\nSpeller, Jr., who surprised me with the depth of his knowledge of\r\nmy family. I informed him that the Grand Duchess Anastasia had left\r\nthe manuscript with me, a close friend, shortly before her death in\r\n1919. I hoped--naively--to achieve early publication of the manuscript\r\nwhile keeping secret my true identity. Dr. Jon Speller then joined\r\nthe conversation. He asked if I would be willing to take a polygraph\r\nexamination to back up my statements. Upon my consenting to do so, they\r\nagreed to read the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThey, and their father, Mr. Robert E. B. Speller, Sr., President of the\r\nfirm, after reading the manuscript became convinced for various reasons\r\nthat the manuscript could have been written only by a member of the\r\nImperial family. They questioned me at length and finally I confided\r\nto Dr. Jon Speller and then to Mr. Robert Speller, Jr. that their\r\nsuspicions were correct, that I was Anastasia, but that, if possible, I\r\nwould like to retain my anonymity.\r\n\r\nTherefore the polygraph examination, given by the noted polygraph\r\nexpert Mr. Cleve Backster, was begun by testing me on my statements\r\nthat I was a friend of Anastasia. Mr. Backster quickly recognized\r\nthat I was withholding pertinent information, even to the extent that\r\nI could be Anastasia; I finally admitted my real identity to him. In\r\na series lasting more than thirty hours in all, Mr. Backster became\r\nconvinced that I am really Anastasia. I signed a contract with Robert\r\nSpeller & Sons and began editing my book with Mr. Earl L. Packer,\r\nsenior editor of the firm, and Mr. Robert Speller, Jr.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for bringing the book before the world at the present time\r\nwill, I hope, be readily understood. They are not complicated. First,\r\nI wished to come to the defense of my deceased parents, against whom\r\nmany unfounded accusations and slanders were made. Second, I felt that\r\nvarious distortions of history which have been given wide circulation\r\nneeded to be corrected. Third, I wished to expose the falsity of the\r\nclaims of other persons to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Fourth,\r\nI desired to establish a foundation which would set up a museum,\r\nwith a small chapel therein, to honor my family who loved Russia so\r\nfaithfully; and also to assure, in so far as I might be able to do so,\r\nfunds for its maintenance, hoping proceeds from the sale of the book\r\nmight in large measure provide such funds. Fifth, I wished to establish\r\na fund for the provision of financial assistance to destitute former\r\nRussian soldiers and officers; again I hoped that the proceeds of the\r\nsale of the book might help in this undertaking. Sixth, I planned\r\nthat, in the event the proceeds of the sale of my book should provide\r\nsufficient funds to enable me to do so, I would assist financially a\r\nvery small number of charitable and philanthropic organizations which,\r\nfor the most part, I have already definitively selected.\r\n\r\nSometime earlier I had come to doubt that, if publication of the\r\nbook were postponed until after my death, as I had earlier resolved,\r\nmy projects would ever materialize. Also, I thought unlikely the\r\npossibility that anyone but myself could or would make knowledgeable\r\nand effective defense against whatever unfavorable criticism might be\r\nmade of the book and myself upon its publication.\r\n\r\nI have had the opportunity for a relatively quiet life in the United\r\nStates, where I have had comparative freedom from all the attentions\r\nthat might have surrounded an earlier reappearance in the world in\r\nmy true identity. But my purposes, as enumerated above, could not\r\nbe accomplished by remaining longer submerged. So I have resolved\r\nto balance the opportunities for good against the possible personal\r\ninconveniences, hoping still to be able, after publication of my book,\r\nto continue to live undisturbed a simple, private life devoted in large\r\npart to further writing.\r\n\r\n  A.N.R. 1963\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANASTASIA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I The Youthful Years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI EARLIEST MEMORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was June 5th, 1901, by the Russian calendar, June 18th by the new.\r\nSuspense and excitement abounded at Peterhof. The accouchement of the\r\nTsarina was momentarily expected. The fourth child, surely this time it\r\nwould be a boy. Russia bowed to the little Grand Duchess Olga, then to\r\nthe baby Tatiana. But Marie, a third daughter in succession, had been\r\nentirely too many. However, all would be righted if this fourth child\r\nwere the long-awaited Tsarevich.\r\n\r\nAt last, the guns: the baby had arrived; a three hundred gun salute\r\nwould announce an Imperial Grand Duke and heir to the Russian throne.\r\nOne hundred and one guns would announce a Grand Duchess. The guns\r\nsaluted a second time. The people paused to count--three, four, five,\r\non and on, came the rhythmical booms. The populace stood breathless.\r\nTwenty-three, on and on, one hundred, one hundred and one, the guns\r\nstopped. No, it could not be. It was not possible. Alas, yes. The\r\nfourth child of the Tsar and Tsarina of Russia was another daughter.\r\nCaught in an anticlimax, the man in the street went his way, but\r\ndiplomatic Russia said “Bah” and resented the Tsarina who could not\r\nfulfill her function. The Tsar and the Tsarina accepted the inevitable\r\nand said, “It is God’s will.”\r\n\r\nAll the while I, the unconscious cause of this frustration, had lain\r\npeacefully in the same little crib which had cradled the three sisters\r\nbefore me. It was not long however before the unwelcomed wee one won\r\nthe hearts of its parents and I was christened Anastasia, but to the\r\nworld outside I was number four, almost forgotten beyond the family\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nAs a child, my tomboy spirit predominated and I was permitted to\r\nindulge this urge until I became something of a novelty in a court\r\nreeking with formality. Nothing pleased me more than an audience,\r\nespecially when they nodded and whispered “cute.”\r\n\r\nMy next older sister Marie and I were inseparable. At an early age my\r\ngreatest delight was to arouse her curiosity. Often when we were at the\r\nheight of some make-believe, I would suddenly dart away. Marie was as\r\nslow to action as I was quick, so I would slip out of sight into one of\r\nmy hiding places. Then began the hunt I revelled in. The searchers went\r\naround, as I listened from my vantage point, purring with satisfaction\r\nwhen I heard the call, “Anastasia, where are you? Be a good girl and\r\ngive us a hint.” These games began good-naturedly, but often when\r\nthe hunt dragged on, I lost patience and felt compelled to reveal my\r\nwhereabouts.\r\n\r\nSecret hiding places became an obsession with me, especially tiny ones\r\nso snug I had to squeeze into them. There I often stayed gloating\r\nover the bewilderment and eventual rage of searchers. Once when I was\r\nquite young I slipped out of the nursery onto the balcony. It was late\r\nin the afternoon and the long shadows fascinated me, so that I must\r\nhave remained there quietly for a long time. Suddenly I heard excited\r\nvoices and I decided to keep perfectly quiet. At dusk, in the uncertain\r\nlight, I flattened myself against the shadowed wall. The sentries were\r\nspreading over the park; the worry was growing. I was thrilled when\r\nI knew they were searching for me, but I was a little frightened of\r\nthe gathering darkness. I ran quickly down the stairs and to the main\r\nfloor. Mother was talking to one of the officers when her eyes suddenly\r\nfell on me.\r\n\r\n“Anastasia,” she cried, “where have you been?”\r\n\r\n“Right on the balcony and no one could find me,” I answered with all\r\nthe glee in my voice I could muster.\r\n\r\nAlmost before I could finish, Father was beside me. He took me by the\r\nhand. One look at his face warned me that something was very wrong.\r\nWithout a word he signaled to the distressed nurse. Her face was\r\nflushed. She marched me to my room and I never ventured one look of\r\ntriumph as she undressed me. She did not say a word until I was in bed.\r\nThen she said, “You were a very naughty girl to worry your Mother so.\r\nShe was very hurt.”\r\n\r\nMother always came to kiss me goodnight. I didn’t stir in my bed lest\r\nI should miss her footsteps. Finally I heard her approaching with my\r\nsisters; their voices sounded happy. She stopped at the door for only a\r\nmoment, and Marie entered the room alone. When the nurse turned out the\r\nlights, I realized that Mother was not going to kiss me that night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a penitent little girl asked herself: “Will Mother\r\ncome to me now?” And: “Will she be cross with me?” I was full of\r\ncontrition, but how could I express it if Mother were not in a\r\nreceptive mood? My eyes fastened on the door, hoping to see Mother’s\r\nface. Suddenly she appeared. I ran to her and wrapped myself around her\r\nneck. I promised never to worry her again.\r\n\r\nMother’s daily round took her to the nursery the first thing every\r\nmorning before breakfast to say a prayer with us children and to\r\nread one chapter to us from the Bible. She was usually attired in\r\na beautiful dressing gown of white--occasionally in other soft\r\ncolors--her hair braided and tied with silk ribbon to match the\r\ntrimming of her gown, a habit acquired from her grandmother, Queen\r\nVictoria of England. These were precious moments to us children. She\r\nwas a fairytale empress--stately and beautiful.\r\n\r\nOn July 30th, 1904, Russian calendar, August 12th by the new, my little\r\nbrother was born on a Friday noon. Three hundred guns announced the\r\nbirth of the heir from the Fortress of Sts. Peter and Paul, in St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, it was learned that the Russian fleet at Port Arthur\r\nhad been sunk on August 10th by the Japanese navy. My Mother often\r\nsaid it was a day of sunshine and a day of darkness at the same time.\r\nIt would have been customary to hold a large banquet to celebrate the\r\nbirth of an heir to the throne but my Father would not hear of it.\r\nInstead, prayers were offered in the churches for the lost ones at sea\r\nand for the baby Tsarevich. All day long the bells rang out from all\r\nthe churches of Russia. Thirteen years later Mother spoke of this day\r\nas being as gloomy as the day we arrived in Ekaterinburg. It was on\r\nAlexei’s thirteenth birthday, and about the same hour in 1917, that the\r\nfamily was informed they must leave their beloved home in Tsarskoe Selo.\r\n\r\nI do not remember Alexei’s christening since I was so small, but I\r\nhave been told about it and have often seen his christening mantle\r\nand the cross which he wore on a chain around his neck. These were\r\ndisplayed in a glass case along with the christening dresses of us\r\nsisters. Olga’s was an exact copy of that of Marie Antoinette’s older\r\ndaughter. It had been made in Lyons. Olga and Tatiana held a corner\r\nof the long mantle which was attached to the cushion because of its\r\nweight. Alexei’s godmothers were his grandmother, the Dowager Empress\r\nMarie Feodorovna; his sister, Olga Nicholaevna; his aunts, Mother’s\r\nsisters, the Princesses Irene of Prussia and Victoria of Battenberg\r\n(subsequently Marchioness of Milford Haven). The godfathers were his\r\ngrand uncles, the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich and King Edward\r\nVII of Great Britain; his cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany; his\r\ngreat-grandfather, King Christian IX of Denmark; his uncle, the Grand\r\nDuke Ernest Louis of Hesse, the Empress’ only brother; and his Aunt\r\nIrene’s husband, Prince Henry of Prussia. To commemorate his birth the\r\ncornerstone for the Feodorovsky Sobor (Church) was laid in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo.\r\n\r\nNow that this handsome brother had arrived, the handicap of my life,\r\nthat of being a girl, seemed somewhat lifted. Alexei was a beautiful\r\nlittle boy with a very light complexion and curly auburn hair which\r\nmy Mother brushed lovingly into a curl in the middle, big blue eyes,\r\nlong eyelashes and a most alluring smile. He was the most fascinating\r\nthing in my existence, so whenever an opportunity presented itself, I\r\nran into his nursery bringing various toys to him. Mother had many pet\r\nnames for him, among them: “My precious Agoo” and “Kroshka” which means\r\ncrumb. Olga and Tatiana were permitted to hold the baby; Marie and I\r\ncould only hold his feet.\r\n\r\nOne of my most vivid childhood experiences, when I was nearly four\r\nyears old, happened on a Sunday when we sisters as usual were dressed\r\nin white, ready to go to church. We heard excited voices and saw Mother\r\nrunning upstairs. This frightened us and we all ran after her to the\r\nnursery. There I saw a spot of blood on little Alexei’s shirt. While\r\nnurse was bathing him he sneezed, thereby causing a discharge of blood\r\nfrom his navel. Though I was very young, I could easily tell from the\r\nfaces about me that something was wrong. At the time just what it was\r\nI could not understand. A few years later, when I was about seven, we\r\nthree younger children were playing in the garden when our brother fell\r\nover his cart. Soon a large blue swelling developed around his ankle.\r\nWhen Mother came she fainted at the sight, knowing it was the dreaded\r\nhaemophilia that might kill her son. As a result, the lives of Father\r\nand Mother were noticeably saddened. Father searched in every country\r\nfor a specialist, but without success.\r\n\r\nWe were continually reminded that we must be careful of Alexei. He was\r\nso easily hurt. The toys I was in the habit of bringing to him were\r\nremoved before they reached his hands. Once he fell on his head and his\r\nface swelled so terribly that his eyes were almost closed and his whole\r\nface became a purplish yellow, a dreadful sight. At one moment he would\r\nbe perfectly well; an hour later, he would lie in bed seriously ill.\r\nWe were instructed not to speak to anybody about it, but we innocently\r\ngave away the secret of his illness to some members of our staff who\r\nhad led us into believing that they already knew all about it.\r\n\r\nMother was constantly at his side, never trusting any one else to care\r\nfor him. Each time, when he recovered, Mother was entirely exhausted,\r\nso much so that she was unable to leave her room for days at a time.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexei was well and his normal chubby self, it was hard to\r\nremember that we had to be careful when we played with him. I often\r\nfelt belligerent when he teased me saying, “Go away, you’re playing\r\njust like a little girl; you don’t know this game.” I maintained my\r\ncomposure pretty well and occasionally retaliated by refusing to play\r\nwith him, but he bitterly complained of such treatment. Suddenly he\r\nwould be well again at which time it was difficult to restrain him from\r\ngetting too bold or playing games that might end in disaster.\r\n\r\nAlexei had several guards, Cossacks who were trustworthy and on duty\r\nday and night. Every morning they searched the palace grounds before\r\nany member of the family could walk about in them. Alexei also had two\r\nspecial attendants. One was Derevenko, nicknamed Dina, a huge strong\r\nsailor, a member of the crew of Father’s yacht, the “Standard.” He was\r\nno relation of Dr. Derevenko, Alexei’s physician. Dina applied hot\r\ncompresses and light massages to Alexei, when they were needed. Dina\r\nalso gave foam treatments, and always carried him around when he was\r\nnot able to walk. Unfortunately Dina turned against his master during\r\nthe revolution and was later arrested by the Soviets when they found\r\nsome of Alexei’s belongings in his luggage.\r\n\r\nThe other attendant was Nagorny. He was the last to give Alexei his\r\nusual care. Nagorny took charge of him during the revolution, and was\r\nkilled in Ekaterinburg because he defended the little boy’s property.\r\nThese two, Dina and Nagorny, were constantly at Alexei’s side to see\r\nthat he did not harm himself. They helped my brother to grow to normal\r\nboyhood by using the exercises prescribed by Dr. Derevenko and the\r\nsuggestions of M. Pierre Gilliard, our French tutor. They helped to\r\ncarry on in such a way that the little fellow never suspected that he\r\nwas being shielded. For he was not told of the serious nature of his\r\nillness but was to realize it for himself when he grew older.\r\n\r\nAt his birth Alexei received many titles: “Hetman of all the Cossacks,”\r\n“Knight of St. Andrew,” “Knight of the Seraphim of Sweden,” “Head of\r\nthe Battalion of the Horse Infantry,” “Head of the Siberian Infantry,”\r\n“Head of the Cadet Corps” and others. Alexei loved everything military.\r\nI think he had a uniform for almost every military order in Russia. He\r\nwas so proud to wear each one, and carried himself with true military\r\nbearing. From childhood he had worn a white sailor suit with ribbons\r\naround his collar. When we cruised in the Baltic, he wore a white\r\nsailor cap with the name “Standard” in white on a blue band. When\r\ncruising on the Black Sea he had a black band with yellow lettering.\r\n\r\nOne day in a snow storm I pulled Alexei on his sled. Then he insisted\r\nthat it was his turn to pull me. Soon his hands became swollen but\r\nfortunately this did not result in one of his serious attacks. He was\r\nnot permitted to take part freely in sports, though he was allowed to\r\nride a tricycle and later a bicycle, when he was carefully followed\r\nby Dina. Finally he was allowed to drive a small motor car with his\r\ncousins or a friend.\r\n\r\nAlexei had playmates other than myself. I remember a youngster who\r\nwas driven up the driveway accompanied by a guard and well supplied\r\nwith many toys. He had among other things a box of powdered chalk.\r\nConsidering the boy an intruder and unable to hide my jealousy, while\r\nhe was escorted by the runner, I snatched the box from his hand and\r\nscattered the contents all over the floor. It all happened so quickly\r\nthat no one was able to stop me. Soon I was escorted to Mother. By the\r\ntime I reached her I was all smiles--a bit strained to be sure. She\r\nsat silently and held my little hands, studying them and wondering how\r\nthey could do such a thing. I peeked at her face, putting on my most\r\nwinsome smile. Mother assured me that “Smiles will not help.” Just\r\nthen Father came in and sent me to my room for the rest of the day.\r\nLater he came to see me and said, “You must not fight with your younger\r\nfriends. Always be a little lady.” “I don’t want to be a lady,” I said\r\ndefiantly. Father answered, “Then you cannot live in this place.”\r\n“Where will I live then?” “In one of the guard houses,” said Father. My\r\ndear Father often apologized for Alexei and myself.\r\n\r\nGentle as Father was, I took those remarks seriously, because I knew he\r\nalways meant what he said. So I applied myself to the idea of “being\r\na lady.” It soon paid off. Some time later when I was roaming through\r\nthe park I chanced upon two workmen who were fighting in the ravine. It\r\nlooked serious and desperate. With all the ladyship I could muster I\r\nordered them to stop. To my astonishment they did. The contrast between\r\nlittle me and those two, so huge and menacing, convinced me that there\r\nmust be something in this ladylike business after all.\r\n\r\nBy nature I enjoyed the rough and tumble, while being a lady meant\r\nbeing dignified, sewing, practicing on the piano, in general following\r\nin the footsteps of Olga and Tatiana. I would much rather have played\r\nthe kind of games that Alexei enjoyed. Marie did not like these games\r\nat all. She preferred dolls, which I thought were not half as much fun\r\nas shooting off pop guns. I often held the gun while Alexei slid down\r\nthe toboggan slide held on the lap of his attendant Derevenko or his\r\nassistant Nagorny.\r\n\r\nThe park surrounding our home at Tsarskoe Selo lent itself to my eager\r\ndesire for exploring the world around me, although even this could not\r\nsatisfy my curiosity about that part of the world which lay beyond the\r\nfence. One afternoon I found an owl opposite the balcony in the garden.\r\nI had seen something flying which fell to the ground. When I ran to\r\nit I found an owl which did not move. I wanted to pick it up, but was\r\ntold it was bad luck to do so. In spite of this advice, I picked up\r\nthe bird and stroked and fed it. In a short time it became a real pet\r\nso it could even recognize my step. It always stayed nearby, hopping\r\nabout in a small area, though it didn’t seem to be hurt. Whenever it\r\nheard me, it would fly up and sit on the rail of the balcony. While the\r\nowl was perched there, it seemed to stare at me and I could not resist\r\nwalking around, fascinated by its twisting neck and staring eyes which\r\napparently followed my movements.\r\n\r\nMost of the time I was content to wander through our fairyland park\r\nwith my sisters and brother. Its beauty was overwhelming with fine\r\nvistas embracing gardens, ravines, lakes and even islands. We often\r\nsailed our toy boats on the lake or rowed Alexei in a boat Sometimes\r\nwe sat on shore watching the varied reflections on the surface of the\r\nlake. These might be reflections of the Feodorovsky Sobor with its\r\ngolden cupola, or again a glimpse of the luxuriant tree tops, or the\r\nrapidly changing cloud formations. On the lake the swans glided back\r\nand forth in graceful splendor, but, when they came near our shores,\r\nwith one stroke they erased all the pictures before our eyes.\r\n\r\nThese swans were my special pets. I usually carried bread to throw to\r\nthem. One day in a mischievous mood, I made them think I had come to\r\nfeed them. When they swam toward me expectantly, I ran away. I was\r\nsuddenly thrown to the ground, and the largest of the swans with his\r\nwings spread wide stood over me. He began to beat me with his wings. My\r\nscreams brought help from one of the guards, who drove off the swan.\r\nWhen I stopped sobbing I had not lost my love for the swans, but I had\r\nlearned I could not tease them.\r\n\r\nFather found time to visit us at play every day, often only for a few\r\nminutes, but he made us happy with these visits. Sometimes he watched\r\nus as we went down the slide which had been installed in a large room\r\non the ground floor. He whistled as each child took her turn and the\r\nrest of us jumped up and down expressing delight.\r\n\r\nSeveral times, as a great treat, we children were permitted to take\r\nour bath in Father’s big, sunken tile tub, large enough for one to\r\nswim several strokes. After the bath we romped over the huge couch in\r\nFather’s dressing room, watching the flames dance in the fireplace.\r\n\r\nMother called Father’s study “the forbidden land.” We children were not\r\nallowed to enter it, which made me rather curious about it. I often\r\nran down the hall, hoping that I would find a way to get into the\r\nstudy, but there was always someone who would send me back. If I could\r\nhave found out what Father did there, I would have been satisfied.\r\nOne day I managed to slip through the narrow passage of his dressing\r\nroom and opened the door leading into his study. I was breathless with\r\nexcitement, but kept quiet. I was about to open the door for a tiny\r\npeek, to see if Father were there, when I heard footsteps. I decided to\r\nretreat quietly as if I had gotten there by mistake. But as I backed\r\nout I had moved too quickly and gone too far. I rolled down several\r\nsteps right into the middle of Father’s sunken tub. Fortunately I was\r\nnot hurt, but my feelings were. I extricated myself and retreated down\r\nthe hall in the midst of laughter. I never did know my discoverer.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was still not satisfied, and I was determined to keep\r\ntrying. I used all sorts of excuses for going to his study with\r\npressing messages or gifts. But Mother spoke with finality: “Father\r\ncannot be disturbed in his work.” In spite of Mother’s words, the\r\nopportunity finally presented itself. One day I stood quivering on\r\nthe threshold. There was Father at his desk looking quite serious.\r\nI leaned forward on my toes to take in all that I could see, so far\r\nforward that I lost my balance and fell on my face into the room. I was\r\nterribly frightened, but Father rushed to me and with a smile picked me\r\nup saying: “What are you doing here, baby?” Then he sat me down at his\r\ndesk and held me on his knees. I was speechless to think I was in the\r\nforbidden place. I glanced at piles of papers, then at Father’s face.\r\nWith a hug and a kiss he deposited me in the hallway. “Now run along,\r\nmy little Curiosity.” I skipped away elated and I could hardly wait to\r\ntell Marie I had actually been in “the forbidden land.”\r\n\r\nI was often instrumental in getting my sister and my brother in\r\ntrouble. When we drove to Pavlovsk, a short distance from Tsarskoe\r\nSelo, I watched for the moment when the nurse was occupied with my\r\ncousin’s attendant. I snapped my fingers--a signal to dash to the\r\nbrook for the mud fight. Within seconds our faces and white clothes\r\nwere beyond recognition. These mud fights made the nurse furious. Once\r\nwhen she rebuked me, she said it was a pity I had not been born a boy.\r\nThis worried me so, I went to Mother with the question, “Do you love\r\nme, Mother?” “You know I do, little Shvibzchik,” was her reply, using\r\nher pet name for me. “But if I were a boy, would you love me more?”\r\nI questioned her tearfully. Mother understood; she shook her head a\r\ndecided “No” and I was satisfied.\r\n\r\nSometimes after tea, I slipped into the servants’ quarters to partake\r\nof tea again, because I thought they had more interesting things to\r\neat. I was quite wrapped up in my small world without realizing that\r\nthere was any other. And yet being born into a royal family I still\r\nkept wondering whether I should have been someone else. I wondered if\r\nmy grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie, ever forgave me for not\r\nbeing a boy. That might explain her critical attitude toward me. I\r\nthought I sensed an unsympathetic bearing in her and I often retaliated\r\nby being irritable which in turn justified her criticism of me. On\r\nsecond thought this same Grandmother understood me perhaps better than\r\nanyone else. When all despaired of me, she would say, “Don’t worry,\r\nshe’ll tame down after a while.” This may have been a comforting\r\nthought to my family, but not to me. I did not want to be like my\r\nGranny, not at all. She was small, dark-eyed, deep-voiced, always\r\nbeautifully groomed. I wanted to be like Tatiana, tall, beautiful and\r\ngraceful. Often after I was tucked in bed, I whispered a prayer that\r\nGod might transform me overnight into a girl like Tatiana. Grandmother\r\nwas Alexei’s favorite. He loved her more than we sisters did. She was\r\nFather’s mother and there was a strong bond between them.\r\n\r\nI remember the satisfaction I felt when some Danish relatives were\r\nvisiting us and my Grandmother said to one, “Anastasia is certainly\r\nsmall,” and the relative replied, “You are not very tall yourself.”\r\nThis kind person must have sensed that I was touchy about my height and\r\nshe attempted to defend me before Grandmother.\r\n\r\nWhen Father’s work was done for the day, he would enter Mother’s\r\napartment and whistle melodiously. This was the signal for a family\r\nget-together or for an exercise outdoors. Sometimes Father took me\r\non a walk alone. He listened seriously to my talk and pretended to\r\nbe concerned about my petty problems. I swelled with pride that he\r\nconsidered my little world was as important as his. He was a lover of\r\nnature, and this knowledge made our walks even more interesting.\r\n\r\nFather had the reputation of being graceful and a good tennis player.\r\nHe played with the best professionals in the Crimea and won most of the\r\ntime. Olga and Tatiana often played with him and I looked forward to\r\nthe day when I would be able to match him in a real game. But that day\r\nnever came. Before the war I was too young, and during the war there\r\nwas no opportunity. I did return the balls occasionally when Father was\r\npracticing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII SCHOOL DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith excitement I looked forward to my first day of school. I was\r\nanxious to make a good impression on my teachers. Dressed in a blue or\r\nwhite pinafore and with ribbon bows on my hair, holding my Mother’s\r\nhand, I felt quite grown up as I joined Marie in the school room on the\r\nsecond floor of the palace. I was proud to hear Mother say that I was\r\ngood, quiet, and thoughtful as I sat at a fair-sized table opposite my\r\ntutor, answering the questions. But to Mother’s disappointment my good\r\nbehavior did not last long. As the days passed, confinement began to\r\nirk me and I longed for the outdoors. School became a difficult chore\r\nfor me, and no doubt I was difficult for my teachers. My mind turned\r\nto the other side of the classroom door. Only the threat of punishment\r\ncould bring me to a school desk at all, and once there, instead of\r\nconcentrating on my lessons, I planned my activities for the hours\r\nafter school.\r\n\r\nMy mind dreamed about Vanka, the donkey, when she came as a present\r\nto Alexei. She was very bright and extremely stubborn. She was named\r\nfor a character in a humorous Russian song of the time. Vanka was\r\ncunning. When Alexei hurt himself, she laid her head on his shoulder\r\nas if she were crying. She could shake hands, wobble as if dancing,\r\nand rolled her eyes flirtatiously. She understood every word we said,\r\noften shook her ears in joy. But when things were not in her favor,\r\nshe stared straight at us. Her ears stood up into a half-cone. She had\r\nbeen a circus donkey, but she would only perform when she felt like it.\r\nDerevenko, the sailor, could make her walk while I rode her, but she\r\nwanted a lump of sugar in payment for every step she took.\r\n\r\n“Anastasia, put your mind on your work,” jarred my consciousness away\r\nfrom Vanka and back into the classroom. I did like arithmetic and\r\ndrawing. I would often doodle until my pencil was taken away and the\r\nlessons resumed. In the spring it was more difficult to concentrate.\r\nThe warm, sweet air and the chirping birds would not let me sit still.\r\n\r\nOften after school, Mother would take me to my favorite farm where\r\nI felt complete freedom. Here were many soft creatures to cuddle:\r\ntiny pink piglets, toylike lambs, calves and colts, the cutest I ever\r\nsaw. There were human babies, too, belonging to the farm workers, but\r\nOlga had a way of monopolizing them. Every place we went the children\r\nfollowed us and were anxious to show anything new that happened. They\r\nall spoke at once, excitedly. We pretended to be surprised, which\r\nencouraged them to tell each story over again.\r\n\r\nOne day one of the workers gave me a tiny chick, born late in the\r\nseason. We put it in a basket with some straw in it. I covered it with\r\nmy handkerchief and went ahead of Mother to hide it in the carriage,\r\nand waited there impatiently. I was afraid that the little thing would\r\ndie before we reached home. Soon after Mother heard the chick cry, she\r\nsaid, “You have taken a baby from its mother. You must keep it well and\r\nhappy.” This chick taught me my first lesson in responsibility. You\r\nnever saw so much affection lavished on such a small thing. I fed it\r\nmost tenderly and presented it with my precious pillow which until then\r\nhad belonged to my doll. In spite of my devoted care the chick’s cries\r\ngrew fainter and fainter and one morning I found it lying on its back.\r\nIt was a shock.\r\n\r\nI decided to give my chick a funeral. I dressed it regally with veil\r\nand gown and, as a great concession, I allowed Marie and Alexei to\r\nhelp lay the little form on a mattress of rose petals in a pretty box.\r\nA bouquet of white flowers was placed on its breast. Then we invited\r\neveryone to the funeral. Besides, I wanted no one to miss seeing how\r\nbeautifully I had prepared my pet. Alexei was the priest, Marie and I\r\nchanted mournfully. Derevenko, the sailor, prepared the grave. The box\r\nwas opened for all to see. At last the box was closed and placed on top\r\nof a stretcher, which was hoisted up on the pallbearers’ shoulders. I,\r\nthe chief mourner, led the procession with a black band on my arm. We\r\nburied the box amidst quantities of flowers, then marked the grave with\r\nthe prettiest stones.\r\n\r\nFor a week I mourned at the grave every day, wondering how the chick\r\nlooked after its journey to heaven. Finally, I dug up the box. I opened\r\nthe cover expecting that the little angel had flown away, but instead\r\nI ran to Mother to tell her the worms were eating my pet. Mother\r\nexplained that the box contained the shell of the chick, the soul was\r\nalready flown away, now nature was destroying only the shell.\r\n\r\nI was quite socially inclined, and made calls on anyone staying in the\r\npalace. I chatted with all on various subjects. “If Olga and Tatiana\r\never marry, will they leave us? Olga squeezed an orange peel yesterday\r\nand it squirted right into my eye. Do you know that Mashka (Marie) put\r\non her underwear wrong side out and refused to change it, it is very\r\nbad luck. Did you hear that “baby” (Alexei) painted a droopy mustache\r\non his face with a crayon? Olga says, he looks like the Cossack\r\nin Riepin’s painting. Do you know that painting? Why do you think\r\nMarie did not take her cold bath this morning? Olga says that mother\r\nkangaroos hide their babies in a sack on their bodies and the babies\r\npoke their heads out to see where they are going. Why doesn’t papa get\r\ncribs for the kangarooshkas?” These ideas or others like them were\r\nexpressed to all in five to ten minutes of social visits. Sometimes I\r\nasked them to tell me stories like the Golden Apple and the Princess.\r\nI clapped my hands and thanked them for the most delicious story. If\r\nanyone was not well, I was ready to play nurse. My one cure for the\r\nindisposed was always a wet towel on the forehead.\r\n\r\nSome of my most pleasant early memories about Mother were the times\r\nwhen she told us stories. There was one favorite she was asked to\r\nrepeat over and over. One day she changed the words slightly and I\r\nburst into tears, saying: “But, Mommy, I like the old story better.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was older, Mother read to me an American book called _Ramona_.\r\nAs much as I could understand, it was a fascinating story about an\r\nIndian girl. It made a big impression on me, and left me with the most\r\ntender feeling of affection for the Indian girl. Several years later,\r\nwhen I heard that an American gentleman was coming to see Mother, I\r\nbegged to be allowed to meet him. I remember that I wore my best new\r\ndress, of white silk, a recent gift from Queen Alexandra of England.\r\nThis frock had smocking at the waist. I was told it came from Liberty’s\r\nof London. I kept this dress until the war, at which time I gave it to\r\nan orphanage.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this American’s visit, the nurse was supposed to bring\r\nme downstairs when Mother rang the bell. But, when I heard the signal,\r\nI ran ahead, and flew down the spiral stairway as fast as my feet\r\ncould carry me, and burst breathlessly into the room. A tall handsome\r\ngentleman arose and politely kissed my hand as we were introduced.\r\nDistressed, and almost in tears, I looked sideways up to him as I cried\r\nout in surprise: “Mother, this gentleman is not an American because he\r\ndoes not have his feather hat or his blanket.” The poor man, whoever he\r\nwas, tried his best to explain, but to me, he still was not an American.\r\n\r\nMashka (Marie) had the most wonderful disposition, but I often got her\r\ninto trouble. We used to practice on the piano in a room above Mother’s\r\nboudoir where she could hear us. When the instructor, Mr. Konrad,\r\nhappened to step out for a minute, we began to roughhouse. Soon the\r\ntelephone rang and we knew it was Mother to remind us to attend to our\r\npractice and not to fool around.\r\n\r\nMother realized that we missed having friends of our age, and she made\r\nup for it by forming a closer knit family of our own. Occasionally we\r\nsaw the Tolstoy girls or the children of General Hesse, once Father’s\r\naide-de-camp. We took some lessons, danced and played with them: two\r\nboys and a girl about the age of my sister Olga. But no intimacy\r\nwhatever was allowed. We also enjoyed our cousins, Aunt Xenia’s\r\nchildren, when they were at home.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexei was about seven years old, he had a nurse named Maria\r\nVishniakova. She disturbed Olga and made her cry. Vishniakova told\r\nMother that the muzhik Rasputin had been upstairs in our apartments\r\nand conducted himself improperly. According to the tradition of the\r\nRussian court, no men were allowed in the girls’ rooms except the two\r\nNegro doormen, Apty and Jim. Father became so upset by the report that\r\nhe personally questioned Vishniakova. She was evasive, and gave one\r\ndate, then another. When Father told her that Rasputin according to the\r\nreport was nowhere near St. Petersburg during those dates, she admitted\r\nher whole story was a fabrication and that it was a malicious relative\r\nof the Imperial family who had had her say what she did. She then burst\r\nout crying and of course she was discharged. It was then that the\r\nattack on Rasputin began.\r\n\r\nAnother incident which caused a great deal of confusion some years\r\nbefore the war involved our governess, Mlle. Tutcheva, a native of\r\nMoscow. She spoke various languages, but no English. Aunt Ella (the\r\nGrand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna), Mother’s sister, had recommended\r\nher for this important position. Tutcheva was a cultured woman and came\r\nfrom a fine family, but at the same time was unpleasantly outspoken\r\nand domineering. She hated the English so that she would not allow the\r\nEnglish language to be spoken in her presence, and often criticized\r\nthe English, especially when we went through our albums of our trips.\r\nShe even complained to us about our own Mother, that she was English\r\nand not a Russian, and constantly exchanged sharp words with Mlle.\r\nButsova, Mother’s favorite lady-in-waiting, addressing her in an\r\nabusive manner, but Mlle. Butsova spared no words for her either. All\r\nthis made us children excited and nervous. Mlle. Tutcheva was also in\r\ncontinual conflict with others in the palace. To our dismay she also\r\nspoke unkindly of Princess Maria Bariatinsky. Later she told Aunt Ella\r\nthat Rasputin visited our apartments although at no time had any of us\r\nsisters seen the man in the upper quarters.\r\n\r\nAunt Ella made a special trip to Tsarskoe Selo from Moscow to inform\r\nMother of this gossip. This incident also came to Father’s notice and\r\nhe came to our rooms to ask about it. We all said we had not seen the\r\npeasant in our apartments at any time. Then the police records showed\r\nthat he was away on those days. Tutcheva finally admitted that the\r\nstory was untrue and that she had never in her life seen Rasputin. She\r\nwas dismissed.\r\n\r\nFather loved everything about Russia: her people, her customs, her\r\nmusic and her national food, particularly he was fond of the dark\r\nbread. It was baked only in the military kitchens and was most\r\ndelicious. He also enjoyed a glass of slivovitsa, a plum cordial.\r\nDuring the war he preferred non-alcoholic drinks and omitted strong\r\ndrinks when prohibition was established, making no exception for\r\nhimself. However, some wine and other drinks were served to high\r\nforeign military officers in Mogilev. Father disliked and often\r\nneglected taking medicine even though it was necessary for his weak\r\nstomach. He believed, as did his Romanov ancestors, that nature is the\r\nbest medicine.\r\n\r\nFather had the best possible education and training. One of his\r\nfavorite teachers was the famous Konstantin Pobedonostsev. This man was\r\nan outstanding theologian and lawyer. He taught Father both law and\r\nreligion, so that his faith remained strong to the very end. Another\r\nfavorite was General Danilov who taught military tactics. He was\r\ncarefully selected for this most important assignment. Father had a\r\nSwiss tutor who taught him the French language and literature, and an\r\nEnglish tutor, named Charles Heath, who acquainted him with the English\r\nlanguage and literature.\r\n\r\nFather had the most extraordinary memory. He was able to recite many\r\nRussian, French and English poems, including passages from Shakespeare.\r\nHe was a fast reader and writer, his sentences being short and concise\r\nand always written in ink. He enjoyed the classics. His reading also\r\nincluded the works of Gogol; Gorbunov’s stories of Russia; and Feodor\r\nDostoevsky, many of whose autographed novels were on the shelves of our\r\nlibrary; likewise the works of Longfellow, Dickens, Wordsworth and many\r\nothers. He was familiar with international law and often remarked that\r\nmany diplomats complicated matters to such an extent that it took a\r\ngreat deal of time to unravel a simple problem.\r\n\r\nOn the “Standard,” the Imperial yacht, he had in his cabin the complete\r\nworks of Shakespeare and other English contemporary authors, and books\r\ncarefully selected by our tutors for us to read during our cruise.\r\n\r\nThe strict training demanded of my Father, the future Tsar, was due\r\nto the discipline of his austere father, Alexander III. Had Father\r\nnot felt restrained by his oath of office, I feel sure he would have\r\nlifted some of the restrictions he had inherited from his predecessor.\r\nHis love for his people and his gentle nature were often shown when\r\nhe lessened the punishment of soldiers by their officers. He believed\r\nin a close family relationship and on one occasion, after receiving a\r\nrequest, he granted permission to a Jewish woman to see her sick son in\r\ntheir prison hospital as often as she pleased.\r\n\r\nFather was very loyal to his friends, many of whom he had known from\r\nhis childhood. He disliked the waste of time on petty talk.\r\n\r\nMany requests were withheld from him, and occasionally actions were\r\ntaken without his knowledge or approval.\r\n\r\nIn spite of previous attempts on his life, he had resumed the ancient\r\ncustom of the “Blessing of the Waters” on the river Neva in St.\r\nPetersburg. When a little girl, I was told that at one of these\r\nceremonies an explosion occurred on the river, injuring several persons\r\nincluding my Father’s physician. Part of the canopy and the windows\r\nof the Winter Palace were shattered. Father, therefore, ordered the\r\ndiscontinuance of this tradition. When an epidemic broke out soon\r\nafter, the peasants attributed it to the decree. So the order was\r\nrescinded and the Epiphany ceremony was resumed. Once I was present\r\nat this picturesque ceremony which was one of the great national and\r\nreligious traditions of Russia.\r\n\r\nAt this ceremony the dignitaries of the Church and State gathered at\r\nthe Winter Palace. The procession formed there and proceeded to the\r\nriver, followed by the church dignitaries. Father took his position\r\nin front of a crimson and gold canopy. A hole had already been cut\r\nin the ice. At the end of the ceremony the priest handed Father the\r\ncross which he dipped in the water and then raised high and made the\r\nsign of the cross in the air. This was repeated three times. It was\r\nso cold that the drops of water froze as they fell on the ice. After\r\nthe ceremony the procession returned to the Palace, where luncheon was\r\nserved to hundreds of guests, who formed a brilliant array in their\r\ncourt regalia.\r\n\r\nI remember how beautiful the ladies looked at the luncheon in the\r\nPalace following the ceremony. They wore long court dresses of various\r\npastel colors and jeweled filets (_kokoshniki_) from which soft veils\r\nhung down. There were glittering diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires\r\nand alexandrites, the latter a rare stone found in the Urals in 1833\r\nand named after the future Alexander II, my great-grandfather.\r\n\r\nMany officers wore the dress uniform of their regiment: the Horse\r\nGuards were in white and gold; the Cossacks in deep blue or crimson;\r\nand the Hussars in white and gold with scarlet dolmans over their\r\nshoulders. The “Blessing of the Waters” ceremony was conducted the last\r\ntime in January 1916. It did not stir the same feelings as before. This\r\ntime there were many dignitaries present and the foreign High Command,\r\nincluding our friend, Sir John Hanbury-Williams, and, of course, Sir\r\nGeorge Buchanan, the British Ambassador.\r\n\r\nGrandeur surrounded us in the Winter Palace where I spent the first\r\nyears of my life. But during the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 we moved to\r\nTsarskoe Selo, when my childhood recollections began to take root.\r\n\r\nThe Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo was our permanent home. Many\r\nmembers of the Imperial family had their residences in this suburb and\r\nnearby; it was only fourteen miles south of St. Petersburg. Our Palace\r\nstood in the middle of a vast park of about six hundred acres, in which\r\nwere located stables, barracks, greenhouses and several churches,\r\nincluding the Feodorovsky Sobor (Church) and Our Lady of Znamenie which\r\nwas my Mother’s favorite. There were islands nearby. On the “Children’s\r\nIsland”, Alexei had a small house; the four rooms were left as they had\r\nbeen at the time of Alexander II. In a book case were some books by the\r\npoet Zhukovsky and there were also books by Byron, Schiller and other\r\npoets which he had translated into Russian. Zhukovsky who was the tutor\r\nto Alexander II spent a great deal of time with him before he came to\r\nthe throne.\r\n\r\nThere were some tiny ports for landing, bridges, dog kennels and an\r\nelephant house, a concert hall and a Chinese village, a theatre and\r\nso on. In the palace grounds was also a white tower, a photographic\r\nbuilding and an arsenal. The barracks for the regiments were located in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\nBefore the war the cabinet ministers came to Tsarskoe Selo with their\r\nreports in the morning and were ushered into Father’s study by an\r\naide-de-camp. Occasionally however, Father met various officials in St.\r\nPetersburg. In order to save time and money the private audiences once\r\na week were held in the Winter Palace in the General Chamber. Because\r\nof several hundred audiences that were held during the day, Father\r\ncould give only a few minutes to each of these audiences and they were\r\nheld standing. The reports of the high officials were received from\r\n10:00-10:30 after his walk.\r\n\r\nSeveral hundred attendants took care of the grounds and buildings;\r\nmany of them lived outside. The personnel included the Grand Marshals\r\nof the Court, Masters of the Hunt, Masters of Ceremonies, Equerries,\r\nChamberlains, coachmen, valets, butlers, chauffeurs, gardeners, cooks,\r\nmaids, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Tsarskoe Selo the Palace of Catherine the Great was surrounded by\r\na tall fence featuring a finely wrought iron gate. This building was\r\nlike a museum, with its matchless rooms of amber and malachite and its\r\nmosaic and gold decorations. Two rooms I especially recall: one an\r\nanteroom in which Catherine kept her famous collections of snuffboxes,\r\nand the other a drawing room with a ceiling of ivory silk satin, in the\r\ncenter of which a tremendous double eagle was embroidered. In a third\r\nroom, the walls were of satin, with exquisitely embroidered golden\r\nwheat and pastel blue cornflowers. There was another room with a double\r\neagle inlaid in its mosaic wooden floor.\r\n\r\nThe private chapel had a large balcony for the choir. This awesome\r\nPalace was in great contrast to Alexander Palace, which we thought had\r\na homelike atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhile I was a little girl, during our absence the public had permission\r\nto go through the Palace, but it was reported that the men conducting\r\nthe tours allowed their relatives to enter our private chambers. Mother\r\nresented this abuse and the tours were forbidden. Later even the park\r\ncould not be visited and everyone had to have a special permit from the\r\nHousehold Minister to enter even the Tsarskoe Selo grounds; this rule\r\napplied also to those employed in our service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII CRUISES\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the summer we vacationed on the yacht, but, since Tsarskoe Selo\r\nwas inland, we went beforehand to Peterhof on the Gulf of Finland.\r\nThere was a splendid feeling of anticipation of a trip ahead. The great\r\npalace of Peterhof was too formal with its many groups of fountains\r\nand Peter the Great grandeur. We preferred to stay in the little\r\nAlexandria Cottage, while we waited for Father to get away. It was\r\nexciting for us children. I remember how often I packed and unpacked\r\nmy little suitcase, with scraps of papers, which I called my secret\r\nrecords. Among my prized possessions was an old bedroom slipper on\r\nwhich our dogs loved to chew. These things in the little suitcase were\r\nmy precious childish treasures.\r\n\r\nAlexandria Cottage stood to the east of Peterhof Palace; it consisted\r\nof two simple buildings joined to each other by an enclosed passageway.\r\nWe had a glassed-in winter garden where palms and other tropical\r\nplants abounded and flowers flourished. Also, there were garden chairs\r\nand a doll house for us children to play in during the rainy days.\r\nOccasionally we had our luncheon here.\r\n\r\nThis estate had originally been purchased by my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, Nicholas I, and he was the first to occupy it.\r\nThere was a saying that Peterhof started with Nicholas and would end\r\nwith Nicholas. The park was beautifully landscaped, with winding paths,\r\nravines, and magnificent white birches against the green spruce trees.\r\nIts natural rustic beauty had been preserved since the time of Nicholas\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the grounds of Peterhof presented a breathtaking view.\r\nTall, graceful trees on both sides arched the roadway, while between\r\nthem were fountains, bronze statues representing various historical\r\nevents and enormous urns filled with flowers. A short distance away\r\nwas a pavilion, a tall tower which we often climbed to get a view of\r\nthe activities on the Island of Kronstadt. We walked to worship at\r\nthe nearby Alexander Nevsky Church, named after a national hero who\r\ndefeated the enemies of Russia in the thirteenth century. From Peterhof\r\nwe took a tender to Kronstadt, the naval base on the island bearing\r\nthe same name. There we boarded the yacht, the “Standard”, which was\r\ntoo large to come in to the wharf of Peterhof. We youngsters were each\r\nassigned a sailor to watch over us. My poor sailor had his hands full\r\nsince disappearing was almost an obsession with me. Once he caught me\r\njust in time as I climbed the ship’s rail and nearly fell overboard.\r\n\r\nOur cabins were large and airy; they were upholstered in light chintzes\r\nand each had a washstand, cold and hot water, dresser and desk. Olga\r\nand Tatiana occupied one cabin; Marie and I, another. Dinners were held\r\nin the big dining salon on the upper deck. There was a chapel where\r\nservices were held regularly by the ship’s chaplain. Mother as at home\r\nstood behind the screen. The “Standard” was painted black with gold\r\ndecorations at the bow and the stern. It was a two-decker and had two\r\nsmoke stacks.\r\n\r\nI was often frightened on the “Standard” when at sunset a gun salute\r\nwas fired from the deck. It hurt my ears. When it was time for the\r\nfiring of guns I would run through the corridor down to the other side\r\nof the boat and hold my hands over my ears. The hoisting of the flag\r\ntook place at 9:00 A.M. and the lowering at sunset.\r\n\r\nCharles Dehn, captain of the “Standard,” was a person whose\r\ncompanionship Father enjoyed, and my brother was Captain Dehn’s shadow.\r\nAlexei never questioned anything “Pekin Dehn” said. Dehn’s wife, Lili,\r\nwas a dear friend of my Mother’s, as well as of us children. Mother\r\nwas the godmother of their infant son, Titi, who occasionally came to\r\nvisit us. When he was about seven years old, he could already speak\r\nseveral languages. We loved to see this handsome boy. At tea time he\r\nsat next to Mother. When she poured tea, he asked, “Sugar, Madame, and\r\nhow many?”\r\n\r\nAnother officer of the yacht, Drenteln, was one of Father’s\r\naides-de-camp and a devoted friend; he accompanied us on our trips.\r\nHe knew Father from his young years and went with him to the\r\nPreobrazhensky regiment. Father found him interesting and they often\r\ntalked all evening and well into the morning.\r\n\r\nFather enjoyed all kinds of sports: tennis, boxing, swimming, diving;\r\nand he could stay under water some minutes. He was an expert rider and\r\nan excellent dancer, but was not especially fond of hunting. He was\r\ndevoted to the Navy and when we were on our cruises he spent a great\r\ndeal of time studying navigation. He was particularly proud of the\r\n“Standard” which was built at the Bay of Odense in Denmark at the time\r\nof his marriage. During one of our cruises we visited the yard where\r\nthe boat was built. Each cruise brought fond memories to my parents of\r\ntheir honeymoon. Mother once said that the happiest years in her life\r\nwere on board the “Standard”.\r\n\r\nFor us a cruise meant spending a part of each day on shore, tramping\r\nin the Finnish forests. On the yacht our attendants turned a rope for\r\nus girls to jump. Then there was the tug of war with an admiral or a\r\ncaptain and other officers joining in. Sometimes we roller-skated on\r\nthe deck. Everyone participated in the fun, except Mother and Alexei.\r\nThey could not enjoy activities, but they joined in the laughter.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we received word that the Dowager Empress Marie, my\r\nFather’s mother, was cruising on the “Polar Star” in the neighborhood\r\nand would pay us a visit. On board was Admiral Prince Viazemsky.\r\nImmediately the holiday atmosphere changed to serious work. We children\r\nhad to stay on board, practicing our music, because Grandmother always\r\nliked to see our musical progress and a concert was invariably planned.\r\nGrandmother was a gifted musician herself and was brought up in a\r\nmusical atmosphere with her whole family constituting an orchestra. I\r\nwas told that on one occasion the public was invited to a concert in\r\nwhich her whole family took part, including her father (Apapa), who\r\nlater became King Christian IX of Denmark, and her mother (Amama),\r\nsubsequently Queen Louise.\r\n\r\nWhen Grandmother Minnie arrived everyone became tense. I especially\r\nfelt rebellious at the endless warnings to be on my good behavior. We\r\nthree younger children had our own early supper, because we could not\r\nsit quietly through the dinner in her honor. Try as I might, I was\r\nbound to do the wrong thing and disappoint everyone when Grandmother\r\nwas around. Fortunately her visits were not long and the minute she\r\nleft we resumed our former manners.\r\n\r\nWhen our yacht anchored in a sheltered cove, we went mushroom hunting.\r\nMother and Alexei seldom joined us in this. But when Alexei came,\r\ntogether we darted this way and that way, dodging the tall trees, and\r\ntrying to catch the scent of mushrooms. The ground was all springy with\r\npine needles and moss so that we fairly hopped along. It was fun to\r\nhear the twigs crunch beneath our feet.\r\n\r\nFather was a fast walker; to keep up with him, I had to run. On one of\r\nthese walks we came to a little stream, partly covered with twigs and\r\nmoss. Father jumped over it and stretched out his hand to me. “Jump,”\r\nhe said. The ground was slippery and uneven and I failed to get a firm\r\nenough grip on Father’s hand so I fell into the middle of the brook,\r\nwith its bed of yellow mud and clay. My face, hair and dress were\r\nplastered with mud and so were my canvas shoes. The long, wet walk sent\r\nme to bed for a while.\r\n\r\nBefore the war we used to take a trip every other year to Fredensborg\r\nPalace near Copenhagen. It was great fun for us children to visit the\r\nwhite villa at Hvidore, which stood majestically amidst the flowering\r\ntrees and bushes, with its terraces offering a magnificent view of the\r\nsea, each level rising smaller and smaller to the top.\r\n\r\nFrom the terraces the sight of sailboats and yachts in the bay gave\r\nus a feeling of tranquility and relaxation. Beyond the marshes were\r\nthe Danish farms with their charming thatched-roof houses, tall poplar\r\ntrees, golden wheat fields and millions of scarlet poppies which added\r\ngrandeur to this natural landscape. It was this that impressed my\r\nyoung mind during our first visit. This villa belonged to my little\r\nGrandmother and her sisters, Queen Alexandra of England and Thyra,\r\nDuchess of Cumberland. It was at this quiet place at Fredensborg where\r\nthe happy family reunion took place during the summer months.\r\n\r\nWe were especially excited on one occasion when Queen Alexandra and\r\nUncle Bertie (King Edward VII of England) joined us at Reval on their\r\nyacht, the “Victoria and Albert”. I recollect that King Edward came\r\ndressed in Scottish kilts. Grandmother Marie and Aunt Olga arrived on\r\ntheir yacht, the “Polar Star”. Later we were joined by Uncle George,\r\nwho subsequently became King George V of England, with his wife May\r\n(Queen Mary) and their children, including the eldest son David, later\r\nEdward, Prince of Wales. In addition, there were many other boys and\r\ngirls belonging to other relatives. We had a great family reunion and\r\na full schedule of activities. Fishing, bathing, rowing, wading in the\r\nshallow waters in the bay and various games were the order of the day.\r\nWe youngsters enjoyed the high swings which were put up especially\r\nfor us. Alexei, though only four or five years of age, had been well\r\nversed in geography and could name all the various ports in the Baltic.\r\nThe Russian Ambassador to London, Count Alexander Benckendorff,\r\nregarded Alexei as being an unusually bright child. Soon we were off\r\nagain in the fiords for a glimpse of Norway. When we were in sight of\r\nChristiania (Oslo), so many yachts and other vessels surrounded the\r\n“Standard” that we were forced to turn back. Apparently the news of our\r\nvisit had preceded us.\r\n\r\nOn our return we brought with us a number of Royal Copenhagen pieces\r\nwhich were adorned with capricious scenes of winter or summer meadows,\r\nall interpreted so realistically, and also numerous figurines of\r\nanimals and fowl, all executed in those soft blue and white colors,\r\nsome with a touch of brown. Only the hands of Danish artisans could\r\ncreate those heavenly colors.\r\n\r\nOnce I remember Kaiser Wilhelm II was cruising on his yacht in our\r\nvicinity and our ship fired a salute to him. The salute was returned\r\nand when the Kaiser came on board our ship, he greeted Father with a\r\nkiss and exclaimed, “My most valued friend.” The German band played\r\nthe Russian national anthem; then the Russian band played the German\r\nanthem. During the ensuing visits, the Kaiser took quite a liking to\r\nme, calling me “The Little Joker”. I also remember how he danced in a\r\nway that Mother thought was undignified and unbecoming to an Emperor.\r\nHe was one cousin who drove us to despair.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Marie joined us in Reval. She brought with her her\r\nsister-in-law, Queen Olga of Greece. Queen Olga was the consort of\r\nKing George I, Grandmother’s brother who was later assassinated. This\r\ndeed made a fearful impression on us. I remember when Granny cried,\r\n“Why do they want to kill an innocent man?” I remember King George as\r\nbeing quite bald, so much so that the Kaiser remarked one time that\r\nKing George had his own exclusive moon. Extreme baldness seemed to\r\nbe a feature of the Danish royal family. Kaiser Wilhelm referred to\r\nthe Danish branch as the “deaf, bald-headed Danes”. King Gustavus V\r\nand Queen Victoria of Sweden also paid us a visit. They came on their\r\nyacht. We later returned their visit by going to Stockholm.\r\n\r\nQuite often our trips were marred by unpleasant incidents, such as\r\nthe time when, while cruising in Finnish waters, an English freighter\r\npersisted in coming too close to our yacht. When our repeated warnings\r\nwere ignored, we were forced to fire a shot which unfortunately\r\nwounded a member of the English freighter’s crew. On this trip we were\r\ninvited to visit Prince Henry of Prussia (Mother’s brother-in-law) at\r\na beautiful villa on the shore overlooking the sea at Jagernsfeld,\r\nso that the Kaiser could show us his fleet at Kiel. Unfortunately\r\nthe weather prevented us from doing this and after a brief stop we\r\nproceeded to England.\r\n\r\nA twenty-one gun salute greeted the “Standard” as we entered the\r\nEnglish harbor of Cowes on the Isle of Wight. This was returned by\r\nthe Russian warships and we passed through a cortege of yachts lined\r\nup on each side as we sailed down the middle. Soon the “Victoria and\r\nAlbert” and the “Standard” were alongside each other. Cheers filled\r\nthe air and salutes were exchanged. Not until the next morning did the\r\nreal entertainment begin, when King Edward VII appeared on the bridge\r\ndressed in the uniform of a Russian admiral. Father stood next to\r\nhim in the uniform of a British admiral. The Russian and the British\r\nflags were flying, as bands played both national anthems. Amidst the\r\ngreetings and cheers we proceeded aboard the “Victoria and Albert” to\r\nthe royal pier. We exchanged pleasant visits and many pictures were\r\ntaken for our albums.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon on the yacht, we sat at a long table. King Edward sat in\r\nthe middle, Mother, dressed in white, looking beautiful and radiant\r\nsitting beside him. Queen Alexandra was opposite the King with Father\r\nnext to her. Alexei kept trying to get King Edward’s attention;\r\nuntil finally the King said: “All right, Alexei, what do you want?”\r\nAlexei replied gloomily, “It’s too late now, Uncle Bertie; you ate a\r\ncaterpillar with your salad.” We were served from gold plates and the\r\ntable decorations were in pink roses.\r\n\r\nThe other guests at dinner were the Crown Prince of Sweden, the Prince\r\nof Wales (later George V), Princess Beatrice, and Princess Irene, wife\r\nof Prince Henry of Prussia. Mother gave a dinner on the “Standard” for\r\nthe ladies in honor of Queen Alexandra. At the many dinners on our\r\nyacht, I remember there were many elegant and beautiful ladies, several\r\nhundred of them: friends, relatives, English, Swedish, German and\r\nRussian. On one occasion King Edward gave a talk thanking us for the\r\nvisit and turning to my Mother called her his “dear niece”.\r\n\r\nThere were several excursions, and in the afternoon tea was served on\r\nthe lawn of the Royal Yacht Club. Several hundred guests were present,\r\nmostly relatives and friends. Mother knew them all.\r\n\r\nAlexei was accompanied by a playmate. One day we were all whisked to\r\nOsborne House, where Princess Henry, Mother’s sister, and Princess\r\nBeatrice played with us on the lawn. This included Marie, Alexei, his\r\ncompanion and myself. Alexei was all slicked up from head to toe in a\r\nwhite sailor suit. Both boys behaved disgracefully. In the afternoon\r\nbefore tea, this brother of mine crawled over a new car belonging\r\nto one of our relatives and by teatime his white sailor suit was\r\ncompletely wrinkled and disreputable. He refused to leave the car and\r\nadded, “You girls can go to the tea; I am happy at what I am doing.”\r\nAll of us were disgusted with our brother. Finally his sailor servant,\r\nDerevenko, took him off the car. At tea we frowned at him and motioned\r\nwith our hands to keep at a distance from us, pretending that he did\r\nnot belong to our family. Tearfully he added to our embarrassment by\r\nsaying aloud; “What is the matter with you girls? I do not like your\r\nattitude. If I were not ashamed, I would cry.”\r\n\r\nAt another time Olga and Tatiana had quite an experience. Dressed in\r\ntheir gray suits they walked about the town of Cowes, unattended.\r\nThey paused in their sightseeing before a window display and entered\r\nthe shop to purchase postcards and photographs for our albums. As\r\nthey came out of the shop a carriage bearing Count Benckendorff and a\r\nfriend stopped on the other side of the street. The girls ran across to\r\nsurprise them, and surprised they were--to find my sisters unescorted.\r\nMy sisters became frightened when a large crowd, having heard about\r\nour visit, recognized my sisters and gathered around them. Finally the\r\ngirls made their escape through a store as a constable blocked the door\r\nagainst the pressing crowd. Two carriages were summoned, one for the\r\nconstable, the other for the girls. At the suggestion of the constable,\r\nthey finally avoided the crowd by taking refuge in a church. This was\r\ntheir first experience of an unescorted adventure, and their last.\r\nWhen they returned to us, we youngsters kept asking them about it a\r\ndozen times, especially when we saw the pictures of the incident in our\r\nalbums. What a great and priceless triumph it was: that young girls of\r\nour position were allowed to show themselves unescorted in public.\r\n\r\nPrince David, who was to become King Edward VIII, came by torpedo boat\r\nto Osborne House from Dartmouth where he was attending the Royal Naval\r\nCollege. And before we left, he took Father through his college. Father\r\nwas so impressed with Dartmouth, he talked of sending Alexei there.\r\nThis was the end of our visit. King Edward, Queen Alexandra, Prince\r\nGeorge, then Prince of Wales, and Princess Mary with all their children\r\ncame to bid us good-bye as we sailed away from Cowes after a most\r\nmemorable visit.\r\n\r\nAs usual our party included Princess Obolensky, Mlle. Butsova, a\r\nlady-in-waiting, of whom Mother was very fond, as were we all; also\r\nMlle. Tutcheva, our governess, with whom I was continually at swords’\r\npoints, because she could not hide her jealousy of Mlle. Butsova, and\r\nalso because of her derogatory remarks about our English relatives.\r\nPresent too, were Count Fredericks, Father’s chamberlain, Ambassador\r\nIzvolsky, Prince Beloselsky-Belozersky, Dr. Botkin, Dr. Derevenko,\r\nCaptain Drenteln and many other Russians from our escort ships.\r\n\r\nThe “Standard” then sailed to Cherbourg, where President Fallières was\r\nto meet us in his yacht, the “Marseilles”. During this cruise, as on\r\nothers, we ran into a great deal of fog and storm and our speed was\r\ngreatly reduced. We arrived late in Cherbourg. Father reviewed the\r\nFrench fleet with the French President, and we children were allowed\r\nto take pictures of submarines which were important exhibits in our\r\nalbums. These albums and Olga’s description in her diary were a source\r\nof great pleasure to us later during the war when we could relive each\r\nmoment of this pleasurable trip. During our arrest in 1917, these\r\npictures were confiscated.\r\n\r\nPresident Fallières gave a dinner on the deck of a battleship, in honor\r\nof my family. It was a beautiful affair. The table was in the shape\r\nof a horseshoe. In the center of the table, roses were arranged to\r\nform the Russian coat of arms. During the dinner bands played popular\r\ncompositions of French and Russian composers. Afterwards there were\r\nfloats on the water, lighting up scenes from the opera _Lohengrin_ and\r\nothers. Someone must have informed them that Mother loved this opera by\r\nRichard Wagner. Launches were made to look like dolphins, sea serpents,\r\nLohengrin’s swan, a huge egg (on top of which was a rooster pulling\r\na gondola with a man inside playing a mandolin), a huge grasshopper\r\nand many other fantastic shapes. A float carrying a band of musicians\r\ndrawn by many make-believe swans ended the procession. There were also\r\nbeautiful fireworks lasting late into the night. Later a complete movie\r\nof the entire display was sent to us; when Alexei was ill, he amused\r\nhimself by operating the projector with interest.\r\n\r\nThe next day we all went to the yacht’s chapel for a divine service,\r\nand to give thanks for the wonderful trip and our new friends. Later\r\nthe President brought us gifts. To Alexei he presented miniature\r\nrifles, guns and drums, as well as a military tent completely equipped\r\nwith a miniature cot, table and folding chairs. Alexei was overwhelmed.\r\nAfterwards he derived many happy hours in the park playing with his\r\nfield equipment. It was this little gun that the Bolsheviks seized\r\nwhile he was playing with it in the garden during our arrest in\r\nTsarskoe Selo. Olga received a writing desk set of dark blue enamel,\r\nbeautifully initialed. Tatiana received a travel clock which she took\r\nwith her later to Tobolsk. Marie received a dollhouse, two stories\r\nhigh, completely furnished, including a bath tub and electric lighting.\r\nI received a beautiful doll with a complete trousseau, even a veil\r\nfor a bride. A twenty-one-gun salute was fired at our departure from\r\nCherbourg, as at Cowes.\r\n\r\nThis cruise made me appreciate Olga and Tatiana; they impressed me\r\nhighly with their graceful manners. I did so wish I could be like them\r\nwhen I grew up. They were so tall and each looked to be every inch a\r\nPrincess, while it did not seem that I had grown at all during these\r\nyears. Even Alexei was an inch or more taller than I. Marie too was\r\ntall. People said I would be short like my Grandmother. I was tall\r\nenough when I sat down, but my limbs were not long enough to suit\r\nme. Our Captain had a suggestion, that I hop on one foot, then on\r\nthe other, three times a day, saying that would produce the desired\r\nresults. I followed his instructions, even doubled and tripled his\r\nrecipe, but without success. On a cruise, when I confided to him that\r\nhis suggestions bore no fruit, he nearly died laughing. I never forgave\r\nthe Captain for making me feel so ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these several cruises during that summer of 1909, Mother’s\r\nhealth did not improve sufficiently to satisfy the doctors. She\r\nsuffered from neuralgia. Karlsruhe was recommended, so the family went\r\nto Mannheim, to Uncle Ernest’s castle at Friedberg. Princess Louis of\r\nBattenberg and her two sons were there too. Then we went to Wolfsgarten\r\nnear Darmstadt. Darmstadt was Mother’s old home, where as a young lady\r\nshe lived with her brother Ernest when he became the reigning Grand\r\nDuke on the death of his father. Mother was fond of him because he\r\nreplaced her late parents, and so we were irresistibly drawn to him.\r\nUncle Ernest was handsome, kind, musical and artistic. Mother had\r\nthe same talents as her brother. His second wife Eleonor (Onor) was\r\na delightful person. She had known Mother since childhood, and their\r\nfriendship grew stronger each year. This trip therefore was meaningful\r\nto our family.\r\n\r\nI recall little of our stay. There was a constant flow of Mother’s\r\nrelatives and hordes of royal children. We four sisters had only one\r\nbedroom to ourselves and Father had one small room where he could\r\nreceive people. I remember Mother’s sister Irene (Amity) and her\r\nhusband Prince Henry, the Kaiser’s brother. She completely won us over\r\nwith her tender affection, and referred to us as “the dear children.”\r\nShe was closer to Mother than were any of Mother’s other sisters.\r\nIt seemed that we were always being summoned to meet a new cousin,\r\naunt, uncle or a friend. One of the relatives had a homely nose, but\r\nfortunately I do not remember who she was.\r\n\r\nFather went to Potsdam as guest of the Kaiser and Kaiserin. It gave\r\nme a queer feeling when I first realized the Kaiser’s deformity. I\r\nremember seeing him ride his horse in his Hussar uniform. He stuck his\r\nreins into his belt; with fingers resting partly on his hip he cleverly\r\nmanipulated the reins. He seemed to lean his weight heavily to one\r\nside. Aunt Irene explained to us about his left arm. She said: “When\r\nPrince Wilhelm was born, the doctors and his father rejoiced because\r\nthe child was a boy. But the little infant had not yet shown signs of\r\nlife. They did everything to get him to breathe. They slapped him,\r\ntossed him into the air, swung him by his feet,--there was a full hour\r\nof working over him. At last he gave a feeble cry. His mother, ill\r\nat the time, did not know of the overly rough treatment of her baby.\r\nLater when she found out, she was in despair, she blamed the doctors\r\nand the nurses for the injury her child had received. For his left arm,\r\nwhich had been pulled out of the socket, became paralyzed and later\r\nshrivelled.”\r\n\r\nMany of our relatives were in deep mourning for King Edward VII of\r\nEngland (Uncle Bertie), who had passed away in the spring of 1910.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm had been hunting with Father in the Oranienburg forest\r\nnear Berlin, and upon their return, in the presence of the widow, Queen\r\nAlexandra, and of the new King George V and Queen Mary, he looked\r\nat all the ladies in black dresses and white collars and remarked:\r\n“Everyone is dressed in black because the old rooster has died.” He\r\nknew Queen Alexandra was partly deaf and could not hear his remark;\r\nbut there were many others who did, including the beautiful Princess\r\nAlice and her husband, Prince Andrew of Greece, who had come with\r\nCousin George from England. We all bore disapproving expressions at his\r\nremark, and one relative whispered, “Wilhelm must be mad.”\r\n\r\nAll of the family knew that the Kaiser was tactless. During the time\r\nwhen he was only heir apparent, he never hesitated to express his\r\nimpatience at having to wait so long to inherit the throne. Long\r\nbefore his grandfather and father died, he wrote the Proclamation, so\r\nas to be ready when the occasion should present itself. Aunt Irene\r\nand Mother cried when they heard that the young Emperor, Wilhelm II,\r\nthe day he ascended the throne, ordered everyone in the palace placed\r\nunder surveillance, including his own mother, the Empress Victoria;\r\nthis in spite of his having sworn to his father that he would always\r\nuphold the honor of the royal house. He despised his courtiers, calling\r\nthem parasites--the same men who during the war wrested his power and\r\nthen held him practically under arrest. He hated the sight of his\r\nMother’s friends and ladies-in-waiting and without hesitation he once\r\nsaid that the only joy in his life was being at the Yacht Club. Now he\r\nwas obviously pleased that Uncle Bertie was no longer in his way. His\r\ndislike had begun when Uncle Bertie had called him “the boss of Cowes”\r\nand, whenever possible, had avoided holding the regatta when Wilhelm\r\nwas present. One would not have believed that he had the use of only\r\none arm and with it skillfully steered the sailboat.\r\n\r\nKaiserin Augusta Victoria always looked beautiful with a clear,\r\nalmost transparent complexion, and was most friendly but quiet. I\r\nwas intrigued by the black ribbon which she wore around her throat.\r\nShe and the Kaiser showed us pictures of the palace at Potsdam. It\r\nwas beautiful except for one room which I thought was in bad taste.\r\nThis room had ornate pillars encrusted with all kinds of precious and\r\nsemiprecious stones and odd-shaped shells. I understand that Father\r\nhad contributed a large uncut diamond to this conglomeration, which\r\nalso included geological specimens, together with petrified snakes\r\nwrapped around the pillars, turtles and crocodiles in creeping or\r\ncrawling positions.\r\n\r\nOne day Father went with the Kaiser to the mausoleum and placed a\r\nwreath on the tomb of the Emperor Frederick III, the Kaiser’s father.\r\nPhotographs were taken on this occasion; later, in the bitterness of\r\nwar, while looking at these pictures, Mother said; “Papa would rather\r\nlay a wreath on Wilhelm’s tomb.” We children cut the pictures of the\r\nKaiser out of all our photographs. Alexei tore up his pictures of\r\nGermany completely, remarking that he (the Kaiser) did not deserve to\r\nbe called a godfather, and indignantly tramped the old photographs with\r\nhis feet. I did the same. After our arrest and imprisonment in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo, I purposely broke several gifts from the Kaiser pretending that\r\nit was an accident in every case.\r\n\r\nBefore we departed for home, Father gave the Kaiserin a pendant of\r\npearls and sapphires, which we had previously proudly displayed to our\r\nfriends for their approval. We liked the Empress and often felt sorry\r\nfor her because she had to put up with such an intemperate husband.\r\nThe Kaiserin gave each of us girls a sewing basket complete with all\r\nnecessary equipment. We used these until 1914, when we gave them away\r\nnot wanting to see them again. Some of the Kaiser’s sons, resplendent\r\nin immaculate uniforms and eagle-crested helmets, escorted us to the\r\nstation, frequently clicked their heels as they saluted us, making\r\nour departure a gala affair. The Kaiserin was forbidden to accompany\r\nus to the station. At the time Mother considered this an insult, but\r\na letter from Aunt Eleonor revealed that the Kaiser in a fit of anger\r\nhad slapped her face that morning before our departure, and each of his\r\nfive fingers had left an impression on her face.\r\n\r\nAs we boarded the train, Father was dressed in his civilian overcoat\r\nand Alexei wore his customary dark-blue sailor suit, while we sisters\r\nwore our traveling suits as it was already cold. On the train, Alexei\r\nsaid: “I was scared of those cousins.” Upon the occasion of that visit\r\nto Germany, Father, out of courtesy, appointed the Kaiserin Augusta\r\nVictoria honorary colonel-in-chief of the Grodno Hussars. This aroused\r\nterrible consternation, especially on the part of Grandmother who was\r\nso furious that she cried and carried on bitterly, saying that she\r\nhoped she would never see the Kaiserin wearing that uniform. I am sure\r\nshe never did. En route home Father received word from Aunt Ella that\r\ntwo Russian millionaires whom he knew had committed suicide. This made\r\na sad impression on us children. Later, after we arrived home, Mother\r\nreceived a Christmas gift from the Kaiser, two enormous red enamelled\r\nvases. I presume they were made by the royal manufacturers. These vases\r\nwere placed in a room in our home, one on each side of a console table.\r\n\r\nEach member of our family settled into his usual routine of activities.\r\nThe problem of finding playmates for my brother loomed large again.\r\nDerevenko, the sailor, had two sons, both younger than Alexei; they\r\nbecame my brother’s playmates, for which my Mother was bitterly\r\ncriticized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV THE CRIMEA\r\n\r\n\r\nLessons were always an ordeal for me, especially when it was time for\r\na visit to the Crimea, for our hearts had always been set on the sea.\r\nLessons, however, were never neglected, for Mother was always strict\r\nabout their regularity. Livadia was the favorite estate of my Father,\r\nas it had been that of his father and grandfather before him. It is\r\nlocated at Yalta on the Crimean peninsula, and its sunshine and warmth\r\nwere a welcome change after the gloomy, cold days spent in our more\r\nnortherly home at Tsarskoe Selo.\r\n\r\nAt this time Dr. Botkin, Mother’s physician, who was ill, requested\r\npermission to have his children come aboard our yacht. Mother replied\r\nthat they could come as often as they wished during their father’s\r\nconvalescence. I heard that the sick should not be forsaken. I, as a\r\ngood Samaritan, did my part by visiting the doctor every day, sitting\r\nat the edge of his couch with my folded hands, like those of an old\r\nlady, wishing to entertain him. We were all very fond of him. He had\r\na wonderful gift of story telling, and after taking in every word\r\nI flew like a bullet to tell Marie and Alexei every detail of our\r\nconversation, often embellishing it to add more zest to the story.\r\nAt home I used to wait for him in the room next to Mother’s bedroom.\r\nI knew he had to pass this room after he finished her examination.\r\nI stopped him and opened my heart to him with my childish problems.\r\nHe asked me all kinds of questions, and in turn I received from him\r\nfirst hand information about his family. I always carried scraps of\r\npaper in my hand. Asking him for his pencil, I scribbled down some\r\nkind of curly-cues for my record.\r\n\r\nWe were so excited when we heard that his two children, Tatiana and\r\nGleb, were coming to visit their father. Dr. Botkin had told us so\r\nmuch about his children that we felt we knew them. At first Gleb was\r\nshy and Tatiana excited, but soon we all got acquainted and had a\r\nhilarious time. My older sisters left the newcomers to us younger ones.\r\nI remember hiding from Tatiana behind a drapery. Dr. Botkin was resting\r\non a couch and kept saying: “I see you, Anastasia,” since my shoes were\r\nclearly visible protruding underneath the drapery. I did not answer\r\nhim. Finally Tatiana pushed aside the curtain expecting to find me\r\nthere, but all she found were my shoes. I had left them there and moved\r\nto another hiding place.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin was so understanding in the way he got into the spirit of\r\nour games. In my eagerness for his children to have a good time, I\r\nasked him confidentially what I could do to make his family happy. He\r\nreplied, “Just being with you is the greatest pleasure you can give.”\r\nHis children called him “Papula,” and I too appropriated that as my\r\npet name for him. In Ekaterinburg, when times were sad, I often said:\r\n“Cheer up, Papula; all will be right.” In Tsarskoe Selo, we girls had\r\nlittle opportunity to play with anyone from outside except occasionally\r\nwith our cousins.\r\n\r\nOne of the unforgettable sights at Livadia was the Hill of the Cross\r\n(Krestovaya Gora) which greeted our eyes each time we reached the Bay\r\nof Yalta, and we gazed upon it in thanksgiving for our safe arrival.\r\nIt was this towering mountain with a monumental cross at its peak that\r\nfascinated me. I refused to believe that the world was round but I\r\nimagined that the peak was one of the props which supported the sky\r\nlike an umbrella. To explore the mountain, I devised a plan. I ran to\r\nMarie about it, since she always was interested in my adventures. As\r\na result, one sunny afternoon, when I was overcome by curiosity and\r\nour nurse was absorbed with the others, Marie and I slipped through\r\nthe bushes and were actually on our way. We dashed from bush to bush\r\nuntil we thought we were safe from possible pursuers. Unfortunately the\r\nmountain which we had set out to climb proved to be farther than we\r\nhad anticipated. On and on we went. Finally we could move only slowly.\r\nThe mountain was still far away. Bewildered and discouraged we turned\r\nhomeward. We were worn out. Suddenly we noticed guards coming toward\r\nus. We rushed toward them, weariness forgotten. “Here they are,” a\r\nvoice sang out, and we two explorers were hurried back to the palace.\r\n\r\nI recall an incident involving Alexei. He suddenly seemed to have\r\ndisappeared. At the first report everyone thought in terms of drowning,\r\nkidnapping, or some other tragedy. Every guard and the household help\r\nran in different directions. Father, by instinct, went straight toward\r\nthe sea, and there he found Alexei happily playing on the beach with a\r\npile of shells he had gathered.\r\n\r\nAt Livadia we had beautiful orchards, bearing every kind of fruit.\r\nWe loved to spend our leisure time in these orchards. The gardeners\r\ndisplayed apples, peaches, apricots and cherries, all according to the\r\nseason. We were especially proud of our vineyards nearby at Massandra.\r\nWe had every kind of grape--white, purple, red--each one a perfect\r\nspecimen and unusually large. Whenever we visited the wine cellar we\r\nfound large bunches of grapes artistically arranged on platters in\r\nthe reception room. They looked so tempting with sprays of leaves\r\naccentuating the soft colors of the fruit. After tea, cakes and grapes\r\nwere passed.\r\n\r\nAfter our tour of the vineyards we usually took the lift down and\r\nwalked through seven huge store rooms. These contained many shelves\r\nof bottled wines lying on their sides, dated, labelled and crested\r\nwith the Russian double eagle. These bottles were in deep red, white\r\nor blue marked with their age, which went back several generations.\r\nFather commented on the age and quality of the wines stored there on\r\nplatforms, in large barrels, holding several hundred gallons of wine\r\nto age. It was here that the coronation wine was made and bottled; a\r\nlot of it still remained in these rooms at the time of the revolution.\r\nThere were varieties of wines here which were used in the palace at\r\nTsarskoe Selo. Father drank only occasionally. He disliked champagne,\r\nbut enjoyed a glass of sherry. Mother and we children used some only\r\nfor medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nMany of our activities were centered around the waters of the Black\r\nSea. We often went bathing but none of us children could be called\r\ngood swimmers. As a matter of fact we were afraid of the deep water,\r\nespecially since that frightful incident when I was swept under by a\r\nhuge wave and was saved by Father from drowning. After this a platform\r\nor breakwater was built for our protection.\r\n\r\nNineteen eleven was a turbulent year for us. On our way to the Crimea\r\nwe stopped for several days in Kiev. Father and my older sisters\r\naccompanied by the ladies of honor and by Crown Prince Boris, the heir\r\nto the Bulgarian throne, went to the opera. After the first act, when\r\nthe curtain fell and the orchestra played, voices were heard from the\r\naudience and confusion began. Prime Minister Stolypin who sat in a\r\nwhite coat in the front row had been shot. The bullet pierced the cross\r\nand his chest. The foul deed was done by a man who used a pass given\r\nhim by a friend of the Okhrana who had been made to believe that he was\r\nanxious to be present at the performance. The family returned earlier\r\nthan expected. Father was as white as a ghost and both sisters shook\r\nwhen they reached the train where Mother was in a state of collapse.\r\nShe had already heard about the murder. It was said that the Minister,\r\nCount Witte, who wanted to regain his former position, which he had\r\nlost to Stolypin, exchanged sharp words with Stolypin shortly before\r\nthe killing took place. Father ordered no reprisal, stating that court\r\naction should settle the matter. For this he was deeply criticized.\r\n\r\nMadame Narishkina told us then the experience the Stolypin family had\r\nhad during the Japanese war. Their home in St. Petersburg was bombed\r\nand about two dozen people were injured; one remained a cripple. She\r\nsaid that arms, fingers and limbs were scattered all over the garden.\r\n\r\nAmongst Mother’s closest friends was Mme. Anna Vyrubova (née Taneeva)\r\nwho sometimes quarrelled with members of the staff. Anna Vyrubova even\r\ndeclared war on Mlle. Butsova. Mother said: “Never again will I have\r\nher in Livadia,” but she broke her promise again and again. Anna’s\r\nmother before her marriage was a Tolstoy and her husband was related to\r\nGeneral Voyeykov, the commandant of the palaces in Tsarskoe Selo. He,\r\ntoo, was disliked by many.\r\n\r\nMother invited Anna to come to the Crimea despite the feeling against\r\nher. She had been our friend for a long while and we accepted her as\r\nthough she were a member of the family. Her house in Tsarskoe Selo\r\nwas conveniently located a short distance from the palace gate and we\r\nchildren loved to go to Anna where we did not spare her cookie jar\r\nwhich was always full and accessible. There was no formality at her\r\nhouse and we were free from surveillance. Anna knew how to make us feel\r\nat ease with her friendliness and understanding, and our ties with her\r\ngrew stronger. Sometimes even Father joined Mother at Anna’s, and that\r\nwas a unique experience for my parents. It was at her house that Mother\r\nand sometimes Father saw the Starets (Rasputin). Hence all the messages\r\nfrom the Starets to Mother came through Anna.\r\n\r\nWe had heard of the malicious stories about Anna’s relationship with\r\nRasputin. However, a thorough investigation disclosed that these\r\nterrible rumors were totally unfounded and that Rasputin had never\r\nvisited her house when she was alone. Mother had a special interest in\r\nher because she had encouraged Anna to marry an officer who had been\r\nshell-shocked during the Russo-Japanese war. The marriage eventually\r\nended in divorce. After the death of Rasputin, Anna moved to our house\r\nbecause Mother feared she, too, might be killed. Her father, Alexander\r\nSergeevich Taneev, held a position at court and Father esteemed him\r\nhighly. He was also a fine musician and from him Anna had inherited\r\nmuch talent. A love for music bound Mother and Anna into this close\r\nfriendship. These musical hours served to release Mother’s suppressed\r\nambitions. In her younger days she had taken voice lessons, learning\r\nmany arias from operas. Had she been born into another family, she\r\ncould have made music her profession.\r\n\r\nMiss Baumgarten or Miss Clements usually accompanied Mother during\r\nher vocal practice. Mother played many complicated compositions\r\non the piano; the harder they were the better she liked them. She\r\npossessed great patience and would never stop until her undertaking was\r\naccomplished. When she played she always laid her rings on a tray. She\r\nhad an idea that the rings interfered with the clearness and softness\r\nof the melody.\r\n\r\nAnna was a constant visitor in our house and occasionally Father\r\ndropped in to listen and enjoy the simple pleasures Mother and Anna had\r\ntogether. Whenever possible, in the evening, we children were allowed\r\nto slip into the room to hear them play and sing classical numbers. At\r\nthese Mother was radiantly beautiful and she carried the melody with\r\nmuch expression and feeling; we were often deeply touched. There was\r\nan expression of sadness in those melodies and the plaintive ones were\r\nthose she sang the best. Father enjoyed Mother’s informal concerts\r\nbut never encouraged the presence of strangers during these intimate\r\nmusical evenings. He also was musical and while young often played the\r\npiano with Madame Narishkina.\r\n\r\nMother often played and sang with Countess Emma Fredericks, the\r\ndaughter of our chamberlain. She, too, had a beautiful voice;\r\nunfortunately she was a cripple. I often wondered what became of her\r\nwhen misfortune swept the country. Another musically gifted friend\r\nwas the lady-in-waiting, Baroness Iza Buxhoeveden. All these people\r\ncontributed considerably to Mother’s happiness. Alexei’s illness in\r\n1912 aggravated Mother’s heart condition and forced her to withdraw\r\nconsiderably from her hitherto enjoyed pleasures. When the war came,\r\nshe stopped singing altogether, though she did take part in chants\r\nduring church services, especially when we were under arrest.\r\n\r\nFather encouraged all sorts of artistic endeavors. He wished to give\r\nan opportunity to all the poor to hear the best of concerts and see\r\nthe plays and cinemas. The year of my birth he sponsored Narodny Dom,\r\na cultural center in St. Petersburg, not far from the Cathedral of\r\nSts. Peter and Paul. This included large concert halls, a theatre and\r\na cinema. The same artists who performed at the Imperial Theater were\r\nheard and seen in this cultural center, at the cost of only a few\r\nkopecks.\r\n\r\nNever did Livadia seem more magical than at the time we arrived to\r\nfind a beautiful new palace replacing the old wooden structure which\r\nhad stood for generations. The new palace construction began in\r\n1910 and was finished in 1911. It had forty or fifty rooms. It rose\r\nnaturally from its surroundings as if it had grown out of the fertile\r\nsoil itself. The old palace had been torn down because it developed\r\nsome kind of malodorous mushroom which was hazardous to our health;\r\nso now only a memory existed in our minds. This was in contrast to\r\nthe new building, so full of light and air, which was constructed of\r\nsteel and of native, white Crimean Inkerman stone. It was quite as\r\ndazzling, in the sunshine, as the sea itself, and, indeed, cheerfully\r\ndifferent from anything we had ever lived in. It did not seem like a\r\npalace, least of all ours. Mother was charmed, especially with the\r\nharmonizing colors; her pleasure made a home of it immediately. She\r\nwas everywhere, supervising the putting up of different pictures or\r\nicons, or the placing of vases (designed by her) of exquisite blossoms\r\non various tables. Father had made plans with the gardeners to make\r\nsure there would be plenty of Mother’s choice, favorite flowers. Her\r\ngreatest favorite was lobelia. She loved its purplish-blue hue so much\r\nshe requested that the same shade of velvet be set into the stair rail,\r\nnext to the Byzantine-style chapel leading upstairs to the second floor\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nThis time the old porcelain stoves were omitted and the palace was\r\nheated by hot water. All the rooms had direct bells connected with\r\nthe room of the officers on duty who could enter the rooms if needed.\r\nFather later had telephone booths installed throughout the park, so he\r\ncould be found wherever he might be. Also we had some trained dogs to\r\nwatch the palace grounds. The colonnades and balconies were in white\r\nmarble, and some of the lower rooms were in lemonwood, mahogany and\r\nredwood. Mother with the help of her architect, Krasnov, selected all\r\nthe needed articles. She herself had painted a picture of wisteria\r\nvines which hung in one of her rooms in the Alexander Palace in\r\nTsarskoe Selo (proof of her artistic talents). In our chapel there\r\nshe had a glass screen of that same color, behind which she prayed\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nFather, too, was delighted with the new palace but his delight\r\ncentered more on the outdoors, with its rare specimens of trees,\r\nshrubs and plants. The climate of the Crimea lent itself to all sorts\r\nof agricultural experiments, and he gave a great deal of time to\r\nnaturalizing importations from the famous Nikitsky Botanical Garden\r\nnear by. Whenever Father had a free moment to himself he enjoyed\r\nworking in the gardens under the bright sun. In the spring there were\r\nvarieties of hyacinths in bloom, white, purple and pink. Many flowering\r\ntrees and shrubs embellished the beauty and elegance. Mother loved the\r\ncombination of wisteria and smoke tree. A year before the war a storm\r\ndestroyed many of these rare trees, which were soon replaced by new\r\nimportations.\r\n\r\nIn front of the palace, facing the sea, was a lovely, life-sized,\r\nreclining female figure in pure white marble. Alexei and I discovered a\r\nhole on the side of the figure. It was large enough to squeeze a kopeck\r\ninto, which we promptly did. On the following morning we rushed out to\r\nsee if it was still there.\r\n\r\nI have many vivid memories of the place and the happy times which\r\nwe all enjoyed while there. To me the Crimean peninsula was a\r\nconcentration of nature’s best: snow-capped mountains with little\r\nTartar villages nestling on their slopes, high plains under\r\ncultivation, and valleys full of wild flowers and berries. The estate\r\nitself was especially beautiful, with its wide lanes, lovely gardens,\r\nand many orchards bearing every kind of fruit. But, perhaps, most\r\nbeautiful of all, and certainly the accent for all the other natural\r\nbeauties surrounding Livadia, was the sea itself. Even today, as I\r\nthink of my childhood visits to the Crimea, happy memories come to my\r\nmind. I can see pictures of vividly colored flowers, soft green-blue\r\nwaters and deeper skies, all fused together in the melting sunshine of\r\nthe Russian Riviera. Life here was most pleasant, with less formality\r\nand with more leisure time for Mother and Father to spend with us\r\nchildren. Our visits usually came in the spring and fall, and the\r\nprotracted winter which intervened became for all of us one long period\r\nof anticipation. Our last stay of any length was just before World War\r\nI, when I was almost thirteen.\r\n\r\nWe went to the Crimea by special train. We invariably went first to\r\nSevastopol, where Father inspected the naval installations. These\r\nincluded the admiralty, naval barracks, hospital, and other buildings.\r\nFather frequently lunched with the officers at the Officers Club. When\r\nhe was ready to proceed, we boarded a yacht or tender at the Tsarskaya\r\nPristan (dock) and landed at Yalta where we were greeted by the people\r\nwho lined the road as our carriages passed through. The natives\r\nconsidered this day a holiday.\r\n\r\nGranny Marie had not visited the Crimea since the death of her husband,\r\nAlexander III, in 1894 and even the new palace which stood majestically\r\namong the trees could not induce her to pay us a visit. During the\r\nrevolution, however, she was forced to flee to the Crimea.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, while we were in the Crimea, Father got up one morning\r\nbefore dawn, and dressed himself in a soldier’s uniform. Eluding the\r\nguards, he walked toward the rising sun. He passed through villages\r\nand saw people working in gardens and fields. All seemed happy and\r\ncontented as they passed by him. We, afterwards, wondered if he had\r\nhis great-granduncle, Alexander I, in mind. For it was believed that\r\nAlexander left one early morning, disguised as a beggar, walking for\r\nweeks through the villages until he reached a Siberian monastery.\r\nHistory tells us that Alexander I was ailing and died in Taganrog.\r\nBut many believe that the day he was supposed to have died, he was\r\nseen escaping into the darkness of the palace grounds. His wife had a\r\nsimple funeral for him, which was witnessed by only a few. The body was\r\nthen brought to St. Petersburg where it was laid in a mausoleum in the\r\nCathedral of Saints Peter and Paul--where all the Russian emperors were\r\nentombed. But it is said that the entombed body was not the Emperor’s\r\nbut that of a soldier who had died in Taganrog at the same time that\r\nAlexander I had escaped. Alexander I allegedly died while hiding in an\r\nancient monastery in Tomsk as a monk; the birthmarks on the body were\r\nthe same as those of the Emperor. Later the Cathedral in St. Petersburg\r\nwas flooded and, when the coffin that allegedly held the body of\r\nthe Emperor was opened, it was found to be empty. The investigation\r\ndisclosed that the coffin had been pried open in the past and the body\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nFather, however, after walking all day and talking to the peasants,\r\nreturned late in the afternoon. He found the police and his staff\r\nofficers terribly worried over his disappearance. Father was happy. He\r\nsaid it had been one of his most pleasant walks for he had seen how\r\nhis people lived. General Dumbadze, who was responsible for Father’s\r\nsafety, was very much upset over this incident.\r\n\r\nAnother time, when Father tried unsuccessfully to leave the palace in\r\nTsarskoe Selo, dressed as a soldier, one of the guards saluted him as\r\nhe passed. Father asked him: “Do you know me?” The guard answered: “I\r\ndo, Your Majesty, by your kind eyes.”\r\n\r\nIn the Crimea there were other activities to look forward to: such\r\nas the bazaar that was organized under the patronage of Mother and\r\nPrincess Bariatinsky. This bazaar was held annually and the funds\r\nraised went to the support of the Children’s Tuberculosis Sanatorium.\r\nThis institution was located on the Imperial estate of Massandra.\r\nIt was housed in a beautiful building overlooking the sea and was\r\nsurrounded by spacious grounds with avenues bordered by roses and\r\nrare species of carefully labelled shrubs and trees. This adjoined\r\nthe Imperial vineyards. Here several hundred children were cared\r\nfor and educated, and when they were cured of tuberculosis, many\r\nentered schools of higher learning. These children came from all\r\nover the Empire, from rich and poor alike. The large sums needed to\r\nsupport the hospital were raised through donations, concerts, plays,\r\nbazaars, selling flowers and photographs. Mother and her friends,\r\nwith the assistance of my sisters, made many articles to be sold at\r\nthis bazaar. We three younger ones felt the responsibility, too, and\r\nenthusiastically found buyers for flowers and for tickets to the\r\nconcerts. The public was always generous.\r\n\r\nAlexei was most eager to help in this project as he, himself, suffered\r\nso much and understood the misery of others. From time to time he gave\r\nhis whole monthly allowance to this cause. Once, on our private train\r\non the way to the Crimea, Aunt Ella joined us at the station in Moscow.\r\nShe, too, brought with her gifts for the bazaar. We took turns selling\r\nEaster eggs on the train and, by the time we reached the Crimea, the\r\ndonations had grown enormously large. One of our entourage carried the\r\nbasket while Alexei sold many of these treasures with his heartbreaking\r\nsales talk to our friends who were on the train. He kept a careful\r\naccount of all the gifts he collected which were valued at several\r\nhundred thousand rubles; a check for 50,000 rubles came from Prince\r\nDolgorukov. Alexei never forgot this generosity and looked forward to\r\nanother year in order to do the same thing. When he was subsequently\r\npraised for this, he answered cheerfully: “I never had more fun in my\r\nlife!”\r\n\r\nOur cousins, the Princesses Nina and Xenia Georgievna, helped us in\r\nthis charity project when they were at their estate in Kharaks. Our\r\nother relatives from Ai-Todor, adjoining Livadia, always lent their aid\r\nas did those of the Youssoupoff family. Countess Vorontsova-Dashkova,\r\nthat beautiful woman, was a great supporter of this charity.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the “Standard” was brought to the Crimean waters from the\r\nBaltic, through the North Sea. Box after box was carried down from the\r\n“Standard.” They contained items to be sold at charity bazaars which\r\nwere held in the gymnasium under the auspices of the Governor of Yalta.\r\nMost of the buyers wished to purchase something handmade by my Mother\r\nor that had been touched by her. Madame Zizi (Elizabeth) Narishkina\r\nassisted Mother and handed to the guests whatever Mother selected.\r\nIt might be a child’s bonnet, a cushion, or a scarf. Mother thanked\r\nthem and offered her hand which they always insisted upon kissing.\r\nOlga and Marie, Tatiana and I sold at different stalls. Hundreds of\r\nbeautiful handmade boxes of all kinds of shapes and sizes, in lapis\r\nlazuli, malachite, leather, or in the famous transparent enamel, or the\r\nlacquer boxes of papier maché were sold in great quantities. In the\r\nevening, after supper, a concert was given by Madame Plevitskaya, the\r\nnightingale of Russia. Her graceful bows were like a weeping willow and\r\nher long fingertips touched the floor before us. She was noted for her\r\nrendition of national songs.\r\n\r\nPlays were given in our honor which were often attended by our friends\r\nand cousins. On one of these occasions Alexei was unruly. During the\r\nintermission he acted like a wild colt. His friend encouraged him in\r\nthis exhibition. He jumped on top of a chair and then up on a table,\r\npretending that he was delivering a speech. He changed his voice, using\r\na peculiar accent in pronouncing certain letters. Marie and I were so\r\nashamed of him and could not believe it was our brother. Mother said\r\nshe would never again allow him to appear in public without the two\r\nolder sisters.\r\n\r\nEveryone worked hard and made large donations besides. During the war\r\na part of this sanatorium was turned into a hospital for the wounded\r\nofficers who recovered quickly to return to combat.\r\n\r\nFather’s purpose in taking the long walks mentioned above was to make\r\nsure that the exercises required of his troops during maneuvers were\r\nnot too strenuous for them. He frequently exceeded by several miles\r\nper day the distance the troops were required to march. On such walks\r\nFather carried only water and bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV SPALA: 1912\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1912 found us once more in Peterhof.\r\n\r\nBefore long we departed on another cruise for official reasons.\r\nKaiser Wilhelm came to Russia for a few days for nautical ceremonies\r\nand to inspect the Viborg infantry of which he was the honorary\r\ncolonel-in-chief; he cruised with us in Finnish waters. He was so\r\nnoisily jovial that Mother called him “the comedian.” At this time in\r\nour presence, one of his officers said something about “my men.” The\r\nKaiser turned sharply and curling his mustache nervously said, “Once\r\nagain, they are _my_ men.” He was happy one minute and moody the next,\r\nso that my sisters remarked, “There is something wrong with him.” But,\r\nof course, at my age, I saw only the humorous side of his nature and\r\nenjoyed his amusing anecdotes and clever caricatures, drawn by himself,\r\nmostly characterizing his own relatives. He was jealous of Mother,\r\nbecause he could not understand how she could become all Russian, as\r\nhis English mother had never become all German. He liked our yacht,\r\nthe “Standard,” and said, “Nicky, I would like to have the ‘Standard’\r\nmyself, but with a German crew.” Father’s face flushed. He knew what\r\nhe meant. The remark was intended to indicate German superiority in\r\nnavigation. After a pause, Father answered: “We are very fond of the\r\n‘Standard’; it is quite comfortable and the family enjoys it a great\r\ndeal.”\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser often asked Father for donations for his charities and\r\nFather could not refuse him. This made my Mother angry. It was during\r\nthis cruise that the Kaiser’s action and behavior aroused disgust in\r\nMother more than before. Often she said: “I remember when he was a\r\nyoung man he used to provoke Granny with his sharp words. But Granny\r\ndid not spare him, either.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of his departure, the Kaiser surprised everyone by kissing\r\nFather’s hand in the presence of our Foreign Minister, Izvolsky, who\r\nremarked, “A kiss on the hand and a stab in the back.” This diplomat\r\nforesaw, obviously, the great events of the coming World War I. We were\r\nglad when the Kaiser sailed away on the “Hohenzollern.” Grandmother\r\nalso did not feel kindly toward the Kaiser since the German absorption\r\nof Schleswig-Holstein and the expulsion of the native Danes from\r\ntheir homeland. The wound was so fresh that she strongly resented the\r\nKaiser’s visits to Denmark. Kaiser Wilhelm hated every living Slav\r\nand I have often wondered how he felt in his heart when he accepted\r\nexpensive gifts from us and ate food with Father, who was not only a\r\nSlav but defended all the Slavs.\r\n\r\nThe same year we went to the monastery of Borodino to celebrate the\r\nNapoleonic defeat on the Berezina River in the war of 1812. The people\r\nwept from joy to see the Imperial family and they gave Alexei relics of\r\nthe war of 1812.\r\n\r\nOccasionally in the fall hunting lured Father to Poland to his estates\r\nat Belovezh in the government of Grodno. On our way there we landed\r\nin Reval where Alexei laid a stone at the harbor to Peter the Great.\r\nFather reviewed the Sixth Army Corps here, while Mother and we children\r\nvisited the Nicholas Institute for Girls. In Belovezh we stayed in our\r\nnew large red brick shooting lodge, with several watch towers and a\r\nfine balcony, from where we viewed the game brought in after the day’s\r\nhunt. One side of this residence held rare stuffed animals found here\r\nyears ago and the other side was used by us as our living quarters.\r\nThe house was located in the midst of a forest of pine and white birch\r\ntrees surrounded by picturesque hills and ravines. Most of the best\r\nhunting took place in the vicinity of Belovezh and Spala.\r\n\r\nOur lodge at Spala was a two-story, gloomy, wooden villa near a river\r\nand a park; one side was closely surrounded by tall trees through\r\nwhich little sunshine penetrated, making it necessary to keep the\r\nlights burning in the corridors and halls. The whole house here, too,\r\nwas decorated in English chintzes.\r\n\r\nWe sisters went horseback riding over the broad, sandy roads and alleys\r\nwhich wound through the woods of white birch and fragrant pines. In the\r\nmidst of fir trees the ground was covered with yellow milk mushrooms,\r\nas bright and smooth as silk which the natives ate raw. We also found\r\ntime to play in the park or fish in the brook and occasionally Father\r\nand his guests had a game of tennis.\r\n\r\nThese forests had been stocked with game for generations of royal\r\nhunters. There were many wild animals roaming at large, including deer,\r\nwild boar, lynx, and wild fowl. But the most rare and sought was the\r\nauroch, an unusual variety of bison found only here and in the Caucasus\r\nmountains. At dusk the party returned, the prey was spread on the lawn\r\nand everyone was supposed to rush out to examine it and express great\r\nadmiration. Mother often made some excuse to stay indoors, or appeared,\r\nout of courtesy, briefly on the balcony; she did not care to see these\r\nlovely creatures killed. The sight of dead deer with their large\r\npathetic eyes, still open, reminded her too much of a human suffering.\r\n\r\nHere, too, were many mounted heads, killed in previous years, which\r\nadorned the various walls in the house. I was glad when Mother had some\r\nof them removed from the dining room. Several large landscape paintings\r\nin heavy frames and some paintings of horses brightened these rooms.\r\nBut the other pictures of hunting dogs with a fowl in their mouths or\r\na large boar lying on the green grass with a spot of blood on its body\r\nwas not very cheerful.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wonderful care which always surrounded Alexei, he\r\nbumped his knee during our trip on the yacht, bursting a blood vessel,\r\nwhich affected his groin and developed into a black and blue lump. It\r\nwas so painful he could not bear to have the doctor examine it. His\r\ncondition had bettered and the swelling below his abdomen was somewhat\r\nreduced, but when he was taken for a ride in a carriage, suddenly\r\nhe became very ill and the swelling increased again, as did his\r\ntemperature, and he became delirious.\r\n\r\nMother’s sister, Princess Irene, wife of Prince Henry of Prussia, and\r\ntheir son, Prince Sigismund, were visiting us at the time. She was\r\nvery sympathetic regarding Alexei’s misfortune because one of her\r\nsons had died of haemophilia. She was one of the very few who knew\r\nabout Alexei’s condition from the earliest symptoms. Those outside the\r\nfamily did not know of the serious nature of Alexei’s illness. Now\r\nAunt Irene joined Mother in taking care of Alexei, especially since\r\nour trip to Spala had been planned several months ahead and previously\r\narranged engagements could not be cancelled without arousing suspicion\r\nconcerning the state of Alexei’s health.\r\n\r\nWe had many house guests who had come from several foreign countries\r\nand from many parts of Russia. Friends from nearby Warsaw sometimes\r\njoined us for dinners and entertainments which had been arranged for\r\nthe pleasure of our guests. There was dancing and other professional\r\namusements. But it was difficult for Mother to appear to be enjoying\r\nthese festive occasions when at the same time fate might claim the\r\nlife of her son. She ran up the stairs whenever possible, in order to\r\nbe with Alexei for a few minutes. Meanwhile Father carried on as host,\r\nwith Princess Irene taking Mother’s place as hostess during Mother’s\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nWe sisters gave a French play before our guests. I was delighted that\r\nour Swiss tutor, M. Pierre Gilliard, gave me a part that contributed\r\nlargely to the success of our little performance. But, while performing\r\nbefore our audience, I mixed up my lines and could not hear the\r\nprompter; so I resorted to improvising. At this moment, while the\r\nguests were hilarious over my ad libbing, an elastic of my most\r\ndelicate undergarment broke and the embarrassing white ruffled cambric\r\nfell to the floor. The audience became well-nigh hysterical and laughed\r\nfar more than if I had remembered my lines.\r\n\r\nThe secrecy surrounding Alexei’s illness had always tormented me. I\r\nknew bleeding was involved, like the bleeding of a wound that could not\r\nbe stopped. Marie and I were almost as ignorant as the general public\r\nas to the real nature of his illness. I remember tiptoeing into my\r\nbrother’s room and there I saw Mother lying on a couch. In one corner\r\nwas a basin filled with pieces of cotton which she had been applying\r\nto the blue swelling. As Alexei’s condition became worse, the rest of\r\nthe family joined Mother at the side of his bed. I would have preferred\r\nto be outside where I could not see my brother’s suffering or hear\r\nhis moans, yet something held me inside. There they were, Father,\r\nOlga, Tatiana, and Marie, all huddled together, a thin layer of hope\r\nspread over their despair. They were all in an attitude of prayer, and\r\ntotally unaware of the struggle that was taking place in me. Suddenly,\r\nshame-faced, I slipped in beside them and found myself in the front\r\nranks of the sorrowing family.\r\n\r\nWe all watched Mother, her hand enclosing Alexei’s as though she were\r\ntrying to transmit her own strength into his frail body. He was not\r\nlying in a pool of blood as I had always expected but looked quite\r\nnormal, except that he was very pale and moaned pitifully. His eyes\r\nseemed to be sunk into his head and he wore a peculiar expression on\r\nhis face. Mother knelt beside him, encouraging her little son with\r\na smile which seemed to say, “You will be well soon.” So long as\r\nMother did not give up, Alexei knew his condition was not hopeless. We\r\nknew her heart was breaking, but before Alexei she was a picture of\r\nconfidence and hope. Mother knew that if she left Alexei to the nurses,\r\nthe boy would stop fighting, for it was her heroic presence which\r\nstrengthened him.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin, Mother’s private physician, relieved her on many nights as\r\ndid my Aunt Irene. Dr. Fedorov, Dr. Dreifuss and Dr. Ostrogorsky were\r\nall summoned to repeat all the treatments which had helped in previous\r\nattacks. Dr. Fedorov, a renowned specialist in haemophilia, was in\r\ncharge of Alexei. He had brought my brother through several other\r\nattacks, after which Dr. Derevenko, who was Dr. Fedorov’s assistant,\r\nbecame Alexei’s personal physician. The doctors’ efforts did not seem\r\nto bring about any change. Mother, however, remained confident even\r\nwhen the doctors were shaking their heads in despair. Mother understood\r\nevery agony of the boy and seemed to be able to relieve his suffering.\r\nAlexei extended his feverish hands to her in appreciation. They\r\nunderstood each other perfectly.\r\n\r\nHopelessness was crushing Father. It was such double torture with the\r\nfear of losing Mother as well as Alexei in the event anything happened\r\nto Alexei. We had practically given up hope, but not Mother. She would\r\nnot give up. We braced ourselves to meet the inevitable. Mother’s face\r\nwas white but calm before Alexei’s searching eyes. As a last resort she\r\ndirected that a telegram be sent to Rasputin at his home in Siberia,\r\nimploring him to pray for Alexei’s recovery. In the morning Mother\r\nsent for Father Vassiliev to administer the holy sacrament to our\r\nbrother. Alexei and Mother looked straight into each other’s eyes, the\r\none sending out waves of assurance, the other hopefully receptive. The\r\nlight in her eyes never failed him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a bulletin had been issued about the boy’s serious\r\ncondition. Father felt that the people had the right to know about\r\ntheir Tsarevich, although it was torture to reveal the secret kept so\r\nlong. At this time Father also ordered the sending of wires to our\r\nforeign diplomatic representatives with a view to locating specialists\r\nwho might be able to help Alexei, but no medic for this malady was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe doctors worked feverishly, their foreheads moist with their\r\nexertions. Silence was broken as Alexei moaned and Mother whispered,\r\n“Has no word come from the Starets?” Alexei clung to life even when all\r\nof us except Mother thought each breath might be his last. Under the\r\ntension we even wished that it would be, to spare him further agony!\r\n\r\nSuddenly one of the officers approached with a quick step and handed\r\na telegram to Father. He read it aloud to all of us in a clear voice.\r\n“The little one will not die, do not let him be bothered too much.”\r\n(This was the sense of the telegram, the words are my own.) When we all\r\nheard these words, the air became charged with renewed hope. Alexei\r\nmust have felt it too for he relaxed into a deep sleep. It continued\r\nfor so long that Mother kept listening to his heart to make sure that\r\nhe was still with us. When he awoke, the bleeding had stopped. Whether\r\nit was the medicine, the holy sacrament, or our prayers, as well as\r\nthose of Rasputin, which caused the sudden turn for the better, we\r\ncould not tell, but we knew that death had been averted. We had seen a\r\nmiracle before our very eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, the boy’s ravaged body began to mend. We could\r\nonly think of Rasputin as a holy man and the instrument in the healing\r\nof my brother. I recall seeing him later--only three or four times--but\r\nhe made a deep impression on me. He was so different from other human\r\nbeings. His piercing eyes seemed to look right through me even into the\r\ndepths of my innermost self. He frightened me. When I first saw him he\r\nsaid, “Is this the little one?” and I was afraid that he would touch\r\nme, but he didn’t. He wore a long cassock with a cross hanging down on\r\nhis chest. He looked like a monk. I was told he walked long distances\r\nbarefoot, not having the necessary money to travel by train. But when I\r\nsaw him he wore boots. By nature he was a son of the soil, like a wild\r\nplant nourished by accident.\r\n\r\nGrigory Rasputin was not a monk at all except in a very loose sense. He\r\nwas not even a member of any holy order. He was a Starets, a pilgrim\r\nand lay preacher among peasants. Could he be a biblical character\r\ncome to life? I wondered. On his many journeys he had learned many\r\nof nature’s remedies. He had faith in them in the face of modern\r\nscientific medicine. He believed nature had made provision for man’s\r\nhealth as she had made provision for his food and drink. He knew an\r\nherb or berry for various maladies. His remedies were simple; it did\r\nnot seem possible they could be effective. I heard he used to put dried\r\nberries in his tea. For bronchitis, he used high bush cranberries or\r\nred raspberry juice. We did not follow any of his remedies for my\r\nbrother. We believed that ultimately God was the only Healer.\r\n\r\nFather Vassiliev, our chaplain, held services twice a day in the\r\ncamp chapel, which had been especially built in a large tent in the\r\ngarden, until our departure from Spala in the late fall. Many different\r\ngifts were sent to Alexei during his illness, including some enamel\r\nand silver icons of St. Alexius and a Virgin and Christ in gold and\r\ndecorated with precious stones. These and others came with the blessing\r\nof the churches in their incessant prayer for his health.\r\n\r\nAfter this dreadful experience in Poland, Alexei was like something\r\nthat had been lost but was now found. We could not do enough for him,\r\nbut in spite of the attention we gave him, he was not spoiled. He was\r\nonly an average boy and there was no reason for him to be different\r\nbecause he had been born to a royal family. There was a magnetism about\r\nthe little fellow which no one could resist, yet Mother and Father\r\ntried to be firm with him. We all knew Alexei was the most important\r\nthing in Mother’s life; in fact, he was in all of ours. His condition\r\nmeant misery or happiness to the whole family. Our first question every\r\nmorning was, “How is Alexei?” We really did not need to ask because\r\nwhen Mother was happy, obviously he was all right.\r\n\r\nLater we heard all kinds of atrocious stories spread about the illness\r\nof this innocent little boy. How could any human being think of\r\nanything so cruel and untrue is beyond my imagination.\r\n\r\nAlexei was very sensitive and sometimes when Mother rebuked him he\r\nwould run to Olga for sympathy. He adored Olga and said he was going to\r\nmarry her. He was even jealous of her in a way, because he did not want\r\nher to pay attention to strangers when he was present. He had a talent\r\nfor making us forget to scold him when he had done something wrong by\r\ndistracting our attention. We all knew his strategy but it was hard to\r\npunish him when we saw him perched on a chair like a little sparrow,\r\nwondering what he would say to get our minds off the coming reprimand.\r\n\r\nLate in the fall a few weeks before Christmas when the snow had buried\r\nthe ground, Alexei was well enough to be moved to Tsarskoe Selo and\r\nthere he made further recovery from his recent attack. This illness\r\ndamaged the nerve and caused his left leg to become shorter. It\r\nrequired painful treatments and a special pad was placed in his shoe to\r\nbuild up the heel, so that he limped only slightly.\r\n\r\nMother had put so much of herself into the agonizing condition that it\r\nwas hard for her to be herself again. For weeks she lay prostrate from\r\nher nursing and emotional strain but blissfully conscious of victory.\r\nShe was disappointed not to be able to go to church to give fitting\r\nthanks for Alexei’s recovery, but the priest came to the house and\r\nconducted a special service in the palace chapel. When she felt well\r\nenough to be up and around again, Dr. Botkin found her heart again in a\r\nweakened condition and confined her to her room.\r\n\r\nDuring these periods of rest, following the exhausting care of Alexei,\r\nMother devoted herself to intensive religious study. The sparing of\r\nAlexei was God’s answer to her prayers; her gratitude was so consuming\r\nshe lived in a realm of religious dedication. She had a rare collection\r\nof Bibles, which were brought to her from St. Petersburg and Moscow;\r\nthese she studied, making comparisons of the various editions. She\r\nwould then discuss what she had learned with Father who was no less\r\ninterested but who did not have the time he would have liked to devote\r\nto the subject.\r\n\r\nIn our library we had some rare scrolls and texts. They had come from\r\nEgypt, Persia, Palestine, Sinai, and elsewhere. One of these was the\r\nfamous Codex Sinaiticus, dating from the fourth century A.D., which was\r\nfirst discovered by the German scholar Tischendorff in a monastery on\r\nthe Sinai peninsula. Great-grandfather, Alexander II, had acquired the\r\nmanuscript; later, in 1862, he had it published. There were also very\r\nearly Russian texts. All these were under lock and key but we could\r\nsee them in the glass case. Father knew the history of each of these\r\ntexts and versions. The children’s library was separate. On its shelves\r\nwere Russian fables and stories, and there were translations from the\r\nDanish. We had some originals signed by Hans Christian Andersen.\r\n\r\nMother was reared and educated in England and Germany and distinguished\r\nherself in her studies. She, herself, was a philosopher and often\r\ndiscussed philosophy with her friends. She saw things the others could\r\nnot see and sometimes connected religion with the writings of the great\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was not a fanatic as many described her, but she could\r\nsee and understand things the others did not. She was well informed on\r\nvarious subjects. She understood and reasoned the value and depth of\r\nher religion. Her and Father’s knowledge of history surpassed that of\r\nmany historians and their vocabulary was powerfully rich.\r\n\r\nWhen Mother was strong enough, we children joined her at luncheon or\r\ntea. In the winter she selected a sunny room where a folding table\r\nwas used for the occasion. One of Mother’s rooms was decorated in her\r\nfavorite color, mauve, and was cosy with matching brocades, curtains\r\nand upholstery. One wall was covered with a collection of icons which\r\nwere gifts from different people. These were continually lighted by\r\ntwo lamps, one blue and one pink. Some of these icons were the most\r\nbeautiful that Byzantine art could produce, others were very simple,\r\nbut all were symbols to Mother and a means of remembering the donors.\r\nMother loved every one of them, and was most appreciative when people\r\npresented her one of these religious treasures. Some of them she\r\ncarried with her from Tsarskoe Selo to Alexandria and Livadia palaces\r\nand later to Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg. She wanted to have the most\r\nmeaningful in her room. Others hung in one of the small rooms of the\r\nchapel together with some of her Bibles and a panagia. She also had\r\nsome icons of great historic importance.\r\n\r\nIcons of these types were made only by the Greeks, Russians, Serbians,\r\nBulgarians, and Rumanians. No statues were permitted in our churches,\r\nsince we discarded the pagan idols at the time of the adoption of the\r\nGreek orthodox religion. A lot of the best treasures in the country\r\nwere looted during the revolution. Other gifts were hung in the long\r\nhall which ran the whole length of the palace including all kinds of\r\nplates and other objects of historical value which we had received\r\nduring many trips in Russia and abroad.\r\n\r\nWe were shocked to see how frail Mother looked when she finally emerged\r\nfrom her convalescence. It was an effort for her to walk the length of\r\nthe hall and she was wheeled to the lift which took her to Alexei’s\r\nroom. She permitted him to come down to the music room and lie on the\r\nsofa, or to amuse himself in the library with his electric trains. He\r\nbuilt villages, fountains, churches out of blocks. We girls read to\r\nhim or engaged him in games to keep him occupied. I can still see my\r\nbrother in the blue nightshirt which he wore after his bath when he\r\ncame down every evening before retiring. Mother took his emaciated\r\nhand and they went upstairs to hear his prayers. She had a tendency\r\nto overdo, hoping no one would suspect how much these illnesses of\r\nAlexei took out of her. It is true that bulletins had been issued\r\ntelling of the serious condition of the Tsarevich but the nature of the\r\nillness had never been revealed to the people--that would be admitting\r\nhopelessness. When Alexei and Mother were well enough to travel we went\r\ndown to the Crimea where the change and rest were always refreshing to\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nThese attacks of Alexei were hard on us. For one thing our education\r\nwas disrupted. It was difficult for us to concentrate on anything\r\nother than our brother’s health. The shared sorrow welded us into a\r\ncloser family and the realization of this brought a change in my life.\r\nThoughts of self seemed empty; childish pleasures began to lose their\r\ncharm. My life was now so bound up with the family that I could no\r\nlonger be lighthearted and free as before.\r\n\r\nReluctantly I realized I was taming down, through sorrow, not\r\ndiscipline. My childhood pastime of painting took a more serious turn.\r\nI even attempted to write imaginary stories about animals. Mother was\r\nso pleased with my efforts she sent one of these stories to Aunt Irene\r\nsaying, “See what our little Nastia has done.” I now took a greater\r\ninterest in music and hoped that by working hard I might sing as well\r\nas Mother or play like Olga. I loved Olga for her true kinship and\r\noften kissed her hand for her understanding of us younger sisters.\r\n\r\nA week or two was a long time for me to stick to anything. Again and\r\nagain I would revert to my childhood spirit but each time with less\r\nof my former zest. My reputation of being a problem child persisted.\r\nPeople often asked, “Where does the little one, small in size, store so\r\nmuch, much energy? She has an endless supply of jokes and pranks.” Some\r\nenjoyed my humor as I could tell from the expression on their faces,\r\nand some did not.\r\n\r\nMarie and I had all kinds of “properties” with which to carry out our\r\npractical jokes. We had a set of stuffed animals which we called our\r\n“Circus Kingdom.” We had a mechanical mouse, a yellow iridescent snake\r\nwith a moving head and a red, sharp tongue, a snapping turtle which\r\nmight tangle in a victim’s dress. Frightened, our victim would jump up\r\non a sofa or chair while Marie and I pretended to be equally scared and\r\nput on an act with wide-open mouths.\r\n\r\nOften, new attendants were warned to watch out for me and my pranks,\r\nbut in the end they suffered. In all these activities I was the leader\r\nand most of the time in disgrace. Once Alexei sprinkled water over\r\nme saying, “You must have been born in a dry summer, your jokes have\r\noutgrown you.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps my most effective toy for playing pranks was a large doll with\r\nbrown phosphorescent eyes that shone in the dark. This mechanical\r\ndoll, when wound, would open and close its eyes, making life-like,\r\nblinking motions. On one occasion, I wound my doll while Marie was\r\nwatching at the bedroom door and, when we heard our victim coming, I\r\nleft the doll on the floor facing the door. We then jumped into our\r\nbeds and pretended we were asleep. The attendant, who had come to see\r\nif we were all right, saw this awful thing on the floor in the dark\r\nwith its blinking eyes. Terrified she ran screaming into the hall and\r\nawakened everyone on the whole floor. After this a sign was put up on\r\nour playroom door which read, “Enter only by permission of Olga and\r\nTatiana.” This was designed to prevent Marie, Alexei, and myself from\r\nentering the room at will.\r\n\r\nIn the face of recent family heartaches I was less and less proud of my\r\nreputation as a prankster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI JUBILEE: 1913\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1913 marked the three hundredth anniversary of the\r\nRomanov dynasty. Celebrations began with a great jubilee in St.\r\nPetersburg. We arrived from Tsarskoe Selo a few days ahead of the\r\nfestivities and took up our residence in the Winter Palace. On the\r\nfirst day we drove in open carriages through streets lined with troops\r\nto the Cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan where a picturesque ceremony was\r\nheld. It was a gray, cold and rainy day, in contrast to the brilliance\r\nthat awaited us inside the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nAccording to custom the Tsar entered first, followed by the Heir to the\r\nCrown. When Alexei appeared, it was not a strapping, healthy Tsarevich\r\nto whom all the Grand Dukes and dignitaries bowed, but a frail little\r\nboy of nine, carried in the arms of a Cossack. This was a sad moment\r\nfor us. We had hoped Alexei would at least be well enough to walk but\r\nhe had not recovered sufficiently from his recent illness. We stood\r\nunder a canopy in the middle of the great church. Alexei sat in a\r\nchair. Mother worried about Alexei. She asked us to watch him also.\r\nDr. Derevenko stood nearby. We sisters were dressed in white, as was\r\nMother. She wore the blue ribbon of St. Andrew, the order studded\r\nwith diamonds and rubies. We had the red ribbon of the order of St.\r\nCatherine with its dazzling star. Grandmother Marie stood with us,\r\ntrim and regal as always, blazing with diamonds, rubies and emeralds.\r\nThe elite of St. Petersburg were assembled here, a magnificent sight,\r\nwith the high clergy in golden robes and elaborate mitres, and the high\r\nmilitary dignitaries in uniforms embroidered in gold.\r\n\r\nDuring the service a dove flew into the Cathedral and circled above\r\nour canopy. Afterwards friends told us they were afraid it would fly\r\ninto the lighted candles and start a fire, but fortunately it flew out\r\nof the church through a door. Since the dove is an important symbol\r\nof peace in our religion, a representation of the Holy Ghost, we all\r\nwondered if this event had a special significance. (It is worthwhile\r\nmentioning that also during the coronation, Father said, “A pigeon flew\r\nduring the ceremonies.” Later, in Ekaterinburg on the day of tragedy,\r\nwhile we were having our last walk in the yard, a pigeon flew over\r\nus three times and then dashed repeatedly against the window.) After\r\nthe ceremony, in the afternoon, we were attired in national costumes,\r\nas were our guests. Mother was especially beautiful, in her high\r\n_kokoshnik_, with her white robe exquisitely embroidered in silver\r\nand long veil. In the evening she wore a tiara of Catherine II and a\r\nnecklace of diamonds. It was valued at several million rubles. It was\r\nso heavy that she used it in all only a few times. Olga and Tatiana\r\nwere attired in soft pink tulle gowns, Marie and I in white silk and\r\nlace.\r\n\r\nSome evenings later a ball was held in the Winter Palace. It was the\r\nfirst official appearance for us two younger sisters, the first time we\r\nparticipated in such a grand affair. I remember how excitedly we looked\r\nforward to that occasion. Mother was indisposed that evening and, after\r\na short while, suggested that we leave early and go to our rooms.\r\nGrandmother, however, took our side and asked Mother to let us stay\r\nlonger, and promised that she would personally look after us. Mother\r\nburst into tears and said: “These women of St. Petersburg might talk\r\nabout the girls, and Anastasia’s jokes might be misinterpreted.”\r\n\r\nI was very unhappy that evening for fear that every move I might make\r\nor every word I might speak would be used against me. All the innocent\r\njoy was taken from me that gala night for fear of those women’s sharp\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Petersburg we proceeded by train to Moscow where the Jubilee\r\ncontinued. On this occasion Mother wore the crown jewels. She never\r\ncared for them after the unfortunate incident which occurred during\r\nher early married life. At that time Granny felt that she still was\r\nentitled to wear the crown jewels instead of the young Empress. In\r\nthe underground vaults in the Winter Palace there was a section where\r\nMother kept some of her personal jewels. Any time she wished to have\r\nthem, she notified the court chamberlain, Count Benckendorff, who sent\r\nseveral responsible persons with papers to fetch the desired pieces\r\nwhich were then brought under guard to Mother.\r\n\r\nAfter the anniversary festivities we never spent another night\r\nat the Winter Palace, our childhood home. But during the war my\r\nsisters often stopped in the rooms for a glass of tea, after various\r\ncharitable meetings. It is sad to think what became of the treasures\r\nstored in those vaults and elsewhere for generations, belonging not\r\nonly to the Imperial family but to the Russian people as well. These\r\ntreasures, worth billions of rubles, were held until the leaders of\r\nthe revolution, Lenin, Trotsky (Bronstein), Apfelbaum, Rosenfeld and\r\nothers got their clutches upon them. It was rumored that much of it\r\nwas divided among their relatives who came to our country for that\r\npurpose and to kill and loot. These people and their successors have\r\nbeen exporting our Russian national treasures, so long guarded by the\r\nImperial family, and selling them to foreign countries.\r\n\r\nFrom Moscow we went to Vladimir, then to Nizhni Novgorod and to\r\nYaroslavl. The latter--an old historic city with a view of the wide\r\nriver--was a charming sight. I cannot even begin to describe the\r\nenthusiastic reception. Throngs of children, cadets, the nobility and\r\nthe townspeople lined the streets right down to the dock. What a rich\r\nsight from the river--this beautiful city on a little hill! The bells\r\nwere still ringing until we could no longer hear them. We passed an\r\nexpanse of meadows, shimmering fields, and the breeze was sweeping like\r\na soft veil over that heavenly country.\r\n\r\nIn every city there were similar festivities, and dinners with\r\nmany guests who had been especially selected to honor my Father and\r\nmy Mother. Father’s guests at dinner were mostly men, and Mother\r\nentertained ladies in separate drawing rooms. The famous Plevitskaya\r\nsang again and bowed gracefully before the appreciative audience. There\r\nwere many outstanding entertainments at which we made many new friends.\r\n\r\nWe were so tired at the end of our trip that Tatiana, in this mood,\r\nsaid: “People and more people--I am tired of them!” Mother, overhearing\r\nher say this, reprimanded her.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Kostroma we sailed on the Volga. People lined the shores,\r\nsome even wading into the water up to their waists. When our boat\r\ndeveloped some trouble and while the repairs were being made, the\r\npeople thronged the shores and sang “God Save the Tsar.” The Imperial\r\nparty was delayed in reaching Kostroma. It was in this terraced city\r\noverlooking the Volga River that the Romanov dynasty had its official\r\nbeginning, and now a special ceremony was to be held to celebrate the\r\nthree hundredth anniversary of the Romanov reign.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached the city and proceeded to the monument of Susanin.\r\nThis was a column on which rested a bronze bust of the first Romanov\r\nTsar, Michael Feodorovich. This column was supported by the peasant,\r\nSusanin. The latter was the Russian patriot who deliberately misled the\r\nPolish army which had invaded Russia and asked Susanin to lead the way\r\nto the whereabouts of the newly elected Tsar, who was in hiding. As a\r\nresult of Susanin’s false directions, the Polish army was destroyed and\r\nwas driven out. The plot of the famous opera, “A Life for the Tsar” by\r\nGlinka, was drawn from this heroic incident. This opera was one of my\r\nFather’s favorites. From the time of Feodor Romanov, a number of the\r\nbrides of the Grand Dukes upon marriage adopted Saint Feodor and took\r\nthe name of Feodorovna as a patronymic.\r\n\r\nFrom the monument, the procession continued to the Ipatiev Monastery,\r\nwhere the first Romanov was sheltered in 1613. In the monastery\r\ncourtyard was the beautiful Cathedral of the Holy Trinity and within\r\nit stood the iconostasis and the throne of Tsar Michael Feodorovich.\r\nThis monastery had been built by a Tartar prince who was the founder of\r\nthe Godunov family and who was the first to be baptized there.\r\n\r\nWhile in the Cathedral we visited the dark rooms in which Michael once\r\nhad lived. We sat on the chairs with the beautifully embroidered double\r\neagles on their backs, and drank tea from the original containers at\r\nthe same table once used by Tsar Alexei. In one of the rooms was a\r\nportrait of Michael and Alexei Romanov. Both looked a little like my\r\nFather. The legend tells us that Alexei was born on St. Job’s day, and\r\nso was my Father. And their experiences were sad, but those of Alexei\r\nwere not as tragic as those of my Father.\r\n\r\nAlso, we went to the cemetery and laid an exquisite wreath made of\r\nsilver in the form of the cap of Monomakh and decorated with jewels on\r\nthe grave of Michael.\r\n\r\nParenthetically speaking, it was a strange coincidence that, in\r\nEkaterinburg in 1918, in the Ipatiev House, the last Emperor of Russia,\r\nNicholas II came to his tragic end. The Romanov dynasty was born in the\r\nIpatiev Monastery in Kostroma in 1613 and died in the Ipatiev House\r\nin Ekaterinburg, three hundred and five years later. History tells\r\nus that, at the election of Michael Feodorovich Romanov, a crippled\r\nbeggar woman who claimed to be a wandering saint had predicted that\r\nthe Romanov dynasty was born with Michael and would die with another\r\nMichael. And so it happened. When Father abdicated, his brother Michael\r\nsucceeded him to the throne but soon abdicated.\r\n\r\nAnother strange incident was that a three hundred year old tree of\r\nimmense diameter, said to have been planted by Michael, had been cut\r\ndown just before we arrived in Kostroma. We saw it mounted on huge\r\nwooden blocks to be preserved as an object of historical interest.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of our party on this trip was Prince Dolgorukov, a\r\ndirect descendant of the family that built the city of Kostroma and\r\nalso the first church in the Kremlin in Moscow. Prince Dolgorukov,\r\nfaithful friend of our family, followed us to Tobolsk and later to\r\nEkaterinburg where he, too, came to a tragic end.\r\n\r\nThe year 1913 also marked two hundred years since the seat of\r\ngovernment moved from Moscow to St. Petersburg in 1713.\r\n\r\nDuring this entire trip we received many gifts and pictures, and our\r\nalbums were filled with photographs of historic events. On our way\r\nhome we stopped at the Nicholas Palace in Moscow. At the functions\r\nthere, Mother wore the old Slavonic robe and the crown jewels. These\r\njewels she never wore again after the Jubilee celebrations ended.\r\nThis was a year of many anniversaries and festivities. Several\r\nregiments celebrated their hundredth anniversary. The Naval Cathedral\r\nat Kronstadt was reconsecrated in celebration of its hundredth\r\nanniversary. We attended all these functions.\r\n\r\nSoon we were back in Tsarskoe Selo resuming our daily routine. During\r\nthis busy year Baroness Iza Buxhoeveden became lady in waiting,\r\nreplacing the young Princess Elizabeth (Lili) Obolensky whose health\r\nhad become impaired. Lili had taken several trips with us, including\r\nthe one to England. We had known Baroness Buxhoeveden previously.\r\nShe had already assumed some responsibilities in the palace. All the\r\nladies in waiting were required to be single and to come from titled\r\nfamilies. Mother did not believe in all the old court etiquette with\r\nits traditions and restrictions. To her it did not matter whether these\r\nyoung ladies were princesses or baronesses. She selected them on the\r\nbasis of the best possible ability, education and culture. Baroness\r\nBuxhoeveden came from a Baltic family which had produced several\r\nambassadors. Her father had been an ambassador to Denmark.\r\n\r\nThe position of lady in waiting was an honorary one to which many young\r\nladies looked forward. To distinguish their rank from the other staff,\r\nthey received badges studded with diamonds, with Mother’s initial and\r\na crown on its top. Some were in silver and some in gold according to\r\ntheir length of service. The ladies in waiting were not permitted to\r\ndiscuss political affairs at any time and all the happenings were to be\r\nkept in strict secrecy. They were not allowed to enjoy the company of\r\nthe officers and aides in the palace.\r\n\r\nTheir duty was to accept telephone calls for Mother and for us girls,\r\nmake notations of the calls, note incoming and outgoing telegrams,\r\nfiling them by date, and make a memorandum of all telegrams and\r\nletters. They also were to chaperon us on drives or at any other\r\nfunction. Maids, a footman and a carriage were provided for their\r\ncomfort. Extra ladies were called to the palace for the day if needed.\r\nLater during our arrest in Tsarskoe Selo, our letters and telegrams did\r\nnot escape from being read. Iza shared our deprivations and followed\r\nus later to Tobolsk, Siberia, but was not permitted entry into the\r\ngovernor’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II The First World War\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII EVE OF THE WAR: 1914\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1914 we went to Livadia. Full days of school\r\nwork were continued here. M. Pierre Gilliard and our Russian tutor,\r\nM. Peter Vasilievich Petrov, accompanied us as usual. Sometimes our\r\ntutors were invited to lunch with us and afterwards joined us in our\r\nhikes when the sun was bright and warm, or in some other recreational\r\npastime. Our hikes took us through the park or along the shore to Yalta\r\nor to the Church of Alexander Nevsky on the opposite hill. Dinner was\r\nthe focal point of the day with friends and relatives as guests. We\r\nchildren, especially, enjoyed Prince Igor Constantinovich and the Grand\r\nDuke Dimitri Pavlovich. Aunt Ella, Mother’s older sister, the widow of\r\nthe Grand Duke Serge, brother of Alexander III, was another cherished\r\nguest. She and Mother had similar religious views, having inherited\r\nthis mysticism from their mother, Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of\r\nHesse, daughter of Queen Victoria of England.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Alice, I was told, was a student of religious history and\r\nmovements, having been inspired by her tutor, a theologian who was a\r\nclose friend of the Hesse family. He also had a direct influence on\r\nMother. This theologian imbedded into her thoughts the terrible fear\r\nof sin. For years we children watched her struggle, trying to leave\r\nthis deeply-buried mysticism and return to reality. However, due to\r\nthe thoughtless criticism by my other grandmother, Father’s mother,\r\nMarie Feodorovna, and also the unsympathetic attitude of the Russian\r\ncourt, she sought comfort in this mysticism and her whole soul once\r\nmore overflowed with it. Then with the misfortune of her son’s illness,\r\nshe reverted to it all the more. At the same time she pretended not to\r\nnotice the criticism and tried to hide her pride; but her sensitive\r\nheart suffered and the words which she should have spoken hardened in\r\nher soul. Courtiers took her for a heartless, cold and eccentric woman.\r\nShe, having been raised by her austere grandmother, tried to carry\r\non in an efficient English manner. Even though her humble faith grew\r\nstronger, her English upbringing never left her and she never became\r\na true Russian in manners, but in her heart and soul she was a better\r\nRussian than most native-born Russians.\r\n\r\nWe boarded our yacht, the “Standard”, which had been brought to the\r\nCrimean waters from the Baltic Sea via the North Sea. We went on\r\nseveral short cruises on the Black Sea. Once we crossed to Constantsa\r\non the Rumanian coast to return a visit of King Carol and Queen\r\nElizabeth (Carmen Sylva) of Rumania. They had come to see us with their\r\ngrandnephew, the future King Carol II. It was an overnight trip to\r\nConstantsa. Carmen Sylva at her late age was still beautiful, as also\r\nwas Princess Marie (Missy), wife of Prince Ferdinand; later they became\r\nsovereigns of Rumania. During this visit Princess Marie and my sister\r\nOlga developed a close friendship. The strained relationship between\r\nMother and Missy’s sister Victoria, who was divorced from Mother’s\r\nbrother Ernest, was improved; all was forgotten now. We had luncheon in\r\na pavilion which seemed to rise right out of the sea. From this vantage\r\npoint we could see many yachts and smaller boats cruising back and\r\nforth for a closer look at the “Standard”.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, tea was served on board the “Standard” for the\r\nmembers of the two families. After tea a great many dignitaries joined\r\nus on board ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1906]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1913--JUBILEE YEAR]\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND DUCHESS ANASTASIA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMUNICATION.

THE GRAND DUCHESS ANASTASIA, THE EMPRESS ALEXANDRA AND\r\nPRESIDENT POINCARÉ\r\n\r\nSTATE VISIT OF FRENCH PRESIDENT RAYMOND POINCARÉ TO RUSSIA--1914]\r\n\r\nThat night a grand banquet was held in the beautifully decorated\r\npavilion overlooking the sea. The lights reflected on the water as\r\nvarious craft sailed by, and the sound of music spread over the sea\r\nlike a cloud. It was a gala occasion with many garlands and flags\r\nflying. I could not help watching Olga intently for I had overheard\r\nsomeone say that this trip was planned with a view to her possible\r\nmarriage into the Rumanian royal family. At the dinner table Olga and\r\nPrince Carol sat side by side, apparently having a good time. The\r\ntable was decorated with tricolors: red, white and blue, and small\r\ngifts were exchanged. Olga received a Rumanian national costume which\r\nwas beautifully embroidered; the skirt was in a dark color woven in a\r\npattern of gold and silver thread, and the blouse daintily embroidered\r\nin white. Princess Marie did not hesitate to admit that she herself\r\nwas a beauty, especially her blue eyes. She was the eldest daughter\r\nof Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and the Grand Duchess Marie\r\nAlexandrovna of Russia. She was named Marie Alexandra Victoria, after\r\nboth her grandmothers, the Russian Empress Marie Alexandrovna and Queen\r\nVictoria of England. As already mentioned, her younger sister Victoria\r\nMelita (Ducky) was the divorced wife of Mother’s brother Ernest of\r\nHesse; she was now married to the Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich.\r\nAnother sister, Alexandra (Sandra), married Prince Ernest of\r\nHohenlohe-Langenburg. A third sister was Beatrice (Baby B.), wife of\r\nthe Infante Alfonso of Spain, first cousin of Alfonso XIII.\r\n\r\nI was filled with a compelling interest I had never before experienced.\r\nBut when we sailed away that night, I learned it had been decided Olga\r\nwas too young to marry. Later she told us that she would rather stay\r\nsingle than marry outside of Russia. We sisters were so happy we could\r\nnot help teasing her about losing a husband. It was a good thing that\r\nAlexei did not know about Olga; he would have been sick with worry that\r\nshe might leave Russia. Later I wished Olga had married at that time,\r\nshe might be alive today.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Prince Carol came to Russia several times and stayed\r\nwith us for a few days. Once he was accompanied by Prime Minister\r\nBratianu. However, even this time, Olga was not given an opportunity of\r\nbeing left with him alone for one single minute, entirely apart from\r\nothers. There were always ladies in waiting and we the younger ones\r\nexcitedly were in and out of the room. She had no chance to hold his\r\nhand and less of being kissed.\r\n\r\nNor was any one else given an opportunity to be with Olga unchaperoned.\r\nIt was in Tobolsk that Mother first realized her mistake in not giving\r\nmore independence to her older daughters.\r\n\r\nOlga was named after my Aunt Olga. She was tall, slender, blonde with\r\na lovely fresh complexion. Her eyes were a lustrous blue, her nose was\r\nslightly turned up. She often jokingly referred to it as “the little\r\nstub”. When she smiled she displayed beautiful white teeth. As I look\r\nback, I am more and more appreciative of her fine character. She was an\r\nomnivorous reader and wrote some stories which she sent to Aunt Missy,\r\nQueen Marie of Rumania, who in turn sent Olga stories she had written.\r\nOlga’s poetry was destroyed by herself at the time of the revolution.\r\nShe had a deep religious faith and often sat beside a patient at\r\nthe hospital praying that God might spare the life of the young\r\nsoldiers. Her touch on the piano was excellent and was able to master\r\nthe most difficult compositions of Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Mozart, and\r\nBeethoven. Mother and Olga often played duets on the piano. Her talent\r\nfor composing and writing was inherited from her Danish and Romanov\r\nsides which boasted a long line of artists, poets, sculptors and\r\nmusicians. She was a mezzo soprano; she memorized musical compositions\r\nvery easily. Mr. Konrad was her musical instructor, as well as ours.\r\nFather’s favorite was Tchaikovsky’s “Chanson Sans Paroles”. When she\r\nplayed it for him, his face lighted up with pleasure. She loved Father\r\ntenderly. Often, when Father was troubled, he talked over his problems\r\nwith Olga and permitted no other member of the family to be present.\r\nShe loved children and sponsored several who were confined to the\r\nhospital. She even provided for their education by setting aside money\r\nfrom her allowance.\r\n\r\nGoing back to our Rumanian cruise, we arrived in Odessa at night, where\r\nthe Imperial train was ready to take us to Kishinev for the unveiling\r\nof the monument to Alexander I. I remember the trip especially because\r\nAlexei misbehaved. No doubt this was due to fatigue brought on by the\r\nheat on the train. In Kishinev we were the guests of the Governor,\r\nan old friend, who wore the longest beard I have ever seen, reaching\r\nalmost to his waist.\r\n\r\nAt the tea which followed, champagne was served. At an opportune\r\nmoment, Alexei took a glass of champagne and drank it down before\r\nanyone could stop him. Soon this champagne took effect and he became\r\nvery gay so that all the ladies, old and young surrounded him. I never\r\nrealized he possessed such a sense of humor. Youngster that he was,\r\nhe did not realize what the champagne had done to him. Of course the\r\nfamily was terrified at this display. In the evening back on the train\r\nwhen the effect had worn off, Father gave him a scolding and he was put\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nWe children now realized that Alexei’s illness and the Jubilee had\r\nbrought our studies to a virtual halt. Alexei and I used to have\r\nour French lessons together, but now he was far ahead of me. French\r\nwas much easier for him than for me. I was really bored with all my\r\nstudies. When I entered the classroom, my face grew long, but when\r\nschool hours were over, I shot out of the detested place like a bullet.\r\nAs a result my tutors were not fond of me and I felt their disapproval.\r\n\r\nWe had been home a short while when the world was shocked at the news\r\nof the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria and\r\nhis wife on the streets of Sarajevo, on June 28th, 1914. After that\r\ndate Father spent very little time with us. He was constantly busy\r\nwith his ministers, diplomats and the Grand Dukes. The President of\r\nFrance, M. Poincaré, spent four or five days with us at Alexandria\r\nCottage in Peterhof. He was as complaisant as President Fallières whom\r\nhe had recently replaced. Father felt drawn to him from the start,\r\nadmiring his diplomacy and friendly manner. Several dinners were given\r\nin his honor with the Imperial family attending. Everyone looked grave\r\nand alarmed, and I gathered matters must be serious. Why should the\r\nassassination of an Austrian be so threatening to Russia? I was told\r\nthat Russia had an agreement which might implicate us all unless the\r\naffair could be settled amicably. The hour the President departed, the\r\nAustrian ultimatum was served at once on Russia and on Serbia.\r\n\r\nOut of this puzzling dilemma which hung over Russia, two things\r\nwere clear to me: the quiet paleness of Father and Mother’s tearful\r\nentreaties imploring that Russia be kept out of war. Mother kept\r\nrepeating, “The country is not recovered from one war before it is in\r\nanother.” She was thinking of the Japanese war, whose horrors were\r\nstill fresh in her mind. Mother’s agonized face vividly foreshadowed\r\nthe tragedy ahead.\r\n\r\nEvery summer there was a review of regimental maneuvers at Krasnoe\r\nSelo (near Tsarskoe Selo). This time they were held in honor of King\r\nFrederick Augustus III of Saxony. We sisters enjoyed horses and each\r\nhad a favorite horse of her own. Tatiana especially knew a great deal\r\nabout them, since she had been taught riding by a competent riding\r\nmaster, but so did we all. The two older sisters were unusually\r\ngraceful on horseback, more so than Marie and I.\r\n\r\nCossack horses were especially fascinating to me, since they seemed\r\nto understand one’s very thoughts. Tatiana described to me how the\r\nCossack and his horse grow up together. Training begins when the young\r\nCossack is given a horse, a progeny of a Cossack horse, trained to\r\nthe requirements of the Cossack regiment. From then on boy and horse\r\nare one, inseparable, each learning to understand the other: the boy\r\nis the head and the horse is the body. When the responses are mutual,\r\nthey are ready to enter actively the Cossack regiment. I often wished I\r\nwere a boy so that I might be a Cossack with a noble horse and wear a\r\nstunning uniform.\r\n\r\nWe drove speedily past the cheering crowds. To see these maneuvers was\r\nmost interesting and exciting as we watched from the Imperial pavilion.\r\nIn one performance a large unit trotted in perfect formation, then\r\nsuddenly all the riders jumped off their horses in unison, then jumped\r\nback on their saddles without a single horse breaking its gait or\r\nchanging its speed. In another exercise each horseman threw his black\r\ncape around his own shoulders and over his horse, so skilfully that the\r\ncape covered both horse and rider. There were many stunts and jumps\r\nover wide trenches filled with water; no one fell into them. During\r\nthe luncheon, which was served under tents following the exercise, a\r\nmessage came stating that Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia\r\n(August 1st, 1914). At once we left for home.\r\n\r\nI remember previous years when I was taken to see the review of the\r\ntroops annually in May. All the society of St. Petersburg felt it was a\r\nprivilege to pay hundreds of rubles for a box seat at these maneuvers.\r\nThe proceeds from the sale of tickets went to charities. I still carry\r\nin my mind that upon our approach a signal was given and cheers spread\r\nalong the quays.\r\n\r\nOur carriages were drawn each by two pairs of pure white horses. Father\r\nalways rode to the left side of Mother’s and Grandmother’s equipage,\r\naccompanied by the staff. We sisters followed swiftly in our carriage\r\nbetween the lines of troops until we reached the Imperial box under a\r\ngreen tent. Father reviewed his troops. First to march were the men\r\nof his own Preobrazhensky regiment, then the Hussars, the Pavlovsky\r\nregiment, the Lancers, the cuirassiers and the others.\r\n\r\nFather did not think that the Emperor Francis Joseph would wage war on\r\nSerbia on account of the killing of the Archduke and his wife. Father\r\nthought so because of the remark the old Emperor had made, in the\r\npresence of Father and persons about him, that the Archduke was good\r\nfor nothing, that not a bone in his body was worth saving, and that he\r\nwas not fit to carry the Crown.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the war several captured, high-ranking\r\nAustrian officers told the Court Chamberlain, General Tatishchev,\r\nthat the old Emperor was directly responsible for the Sarajevo\r\nincident and that the Archduke was purposely sent there, where he was\r\nhated and murdered by oppressed Bosnians of the Dual Monarchy. The\r\nofficers thought it was a deliberate excuse to provoke war and the\r\naim was to destroy the little Kingdom of Serbia and take it under\r\ncontrol as had happened earlier with Bosnia and Herzegovina. They\r\nknew that this little country would not be able to resist the two\r\npowers, Austria-Hungary and Germany. But those millions of suppressed\r\nplucky Serbs had already endured deprivation of freedom and arrests\r\nand confiscation of their property under the Dual Monarchy. They\r\nwere determined to defend what was left of their country from being\r\ndismembered again, and all were willing to die for the right to live in\r\ntheir own land.\r\n\r\nFather sent a telegram to Kaiser Wilhelm asking that the\r\nAustro-Hungarian-Serbian dispute be tried by the International\r\nArbitration Court at The Hague. He also sent word to King Carol of\r\nRumania to wire the Kaiser that Russia did not want war. But all was\r\nin vain. They took the killing of this good-for-nothing Archduke as a\r\ndeliberate excuse, even though the murder was committed by their own\r\ncitizens who resented the Dual Monarchy. It was common knowledge that\r\nRussian mobilization which was under way was directed against Austria,\r\nnot Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII NO CHOICE BUT WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents moved rapidly. Austria and Germany declared war on Serbia. More\r\nthan ever Father was shut away from us, doing all in his power to keep\r\nRussia out of the conflict. But Russia was an ally of Serbia. There was\r\nno choice. German and Austrian troops were already mobilized and were\r\nconducting maneuvers near our border, and soon we, too, were in war.\r\nMother wept copiously. “Why,” she asked, “should millions of Russians\r\nlose their lives because one man is killed? Wilhelm has brought this\r\non. I never trusted him. I never forgave him the humiliation and\r\nindignities toward our Granny (Queen Victoria).” My thoughts flew back\r\nto the visit in Germany when the Kaiser was my friend. Only two years\r\nago we had exchanged jokes. Now he was Russia’s enemy, Mother’s enemy,\r\nand mine. Wilhelm, Mother’s own cousin.\r\n\r\nBefore we knew it the Austrian troops were threatening the old Russian\r\nfortification of Bendery. I was filled with forebodings. Being a\r\nbeliever in dreams, I tried to interpret a dream I had had the night\r\nbefore this news arrived. I dreamed that the forest on the Russian\r\nwestern border was ablaze. I could hear the crackling of the timber and\r\ncould see fierce fire raging high into the sky.\r\n\r\nA few years later, during my escape, I crossed these same forests and\r\nremembered my dream. Then the trees were not on fire but lay with\r\ntheir huge roots pulled out of the ground--witnesses of the terrific\r\nsuffering and tragedy that had occurred there.\r\n\r\nAt Tsarskoe Selo that evening, after the news of the German advance, we\r\nprayed to the Almighty, hoping that disaster could still be averted and\r\npeace could be maintained. We realized how much Father was suffering\r\nwhen he appeared late for dinner. His face was pale, his bearing\r\nindicated anguish. He said, “Russia has no choice but war, when the\r\narmies of Germany and Austria are already on Russian soil.” Mother\r\nburst into tears, and so did we all. Supper was not finished that\r\nnight. We left the table. That same evening, Foreign Minister Sazonov\r\nand the British Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, spent half of the\r\nnight conferring with Father. The next day Father was at his desk at\r\nfive in the morning, working until breakfast. Alexei, who was ill, did\r\nnot know about the war until the next morning.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we all went to St. Petersburg, except Alexei. As we\r\nwere entering the Winter Palace, people gathered in the square and\r\nsurrounded us as they cheered. After an old Russian tradition they\r\nkissed Father’s shoulders and Mother’s skirt. This display of loyalty\r\nbrought tears to Mother’s eyes. Father went directly to a meeting at\r\nthe huge Nicholas Concert Hall with the ministers and generals. Then\r\nthe Te Deum was sung. When Father appeared on the balcony of the Winter\r\nPalace to read the Manifesto declaring war, all of us children and\r\nother relatives stood behind him. At once the voices died down and all\r\nwas quiet as though the whole world had suddenly fallen asleep. The\r\nthousands of people who had assembled in the square knelt down, their\r\ngarments making a rustling sound, and in unison sang “God Save the\r\nTsar.” At this time Father took an oath that he would never make peace\r\nso long as one enemy remained on Russian soil. Then he promised his\r\npeople that he would defend all the Slavs, even if he would have to\r\nshed his own blood. It was a painful moment to announce to the people\r\nthat war was an actuality.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Alexandria and several days later we all left for\r\nMoscow. We were greeted with the same enthusiasm there. The church\r\nbells rang continually as we passed from the station to the Kremlin.\r\nPeople were everywhere, on roof tops, balconies and trees. The Russian\r\nnational anthem was heard repeatedly along the way. Alexei was ill, and\r\nhad to be carried to the Cathedral of the Assumption to hear the Te\r\nDeum. The patriotic demonstrations lasted three days. “Ura” (hurrah)\r\nresounded everywhere. From Moscow we went near by to Sergievo to pray\r\nat the celebrated Troitsko-Sergievskaya Lavra. Practically every living\r\nperson in the area lined the streets to the monastery, the richest and\r\nmost important monastery in Russia. It covered a large territory and\r\nwas surrounded by a lofty, thick wall with many towers. It contained\r\nsome dozen of churches and many historical treasures, some dating from\r\nancient days. Many pages of Russian history had been devoted to this\r\nmonastery, about the heroic defense by the monks in 1608 against the\r\nPoles. Here were the tombs of Tsar Boris Godunov and his family. Here\r\nFather received an icon to carry with him through the battles. This\r\nicon was sent to the field chapel at General Headquarters and remained\r\nthere to the last.\r\n\r\nWith war an actuality, all Russia seemed to unite in a determination\r\nto win a quick victory. Whenever Father travelled, the people greeted\r\nhim enthusiastically; sometimes the whole family went with him and\r\nheard him deliver his war messages. During these trips the air was full\r\nof unity and the family never felt closer to the people. Many letters\r\nwere received from students who begged to be allowed to go to war. “A\r\nbeautiful patriotism,” Father said. “But how little they understand\r\nwhat war is.”\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of the war, all factions drew together in a great\r\npatriotic surge. We saw some of our own relatives return to Russia to\r\ntake part in the war. We sisters hardly knew some of these relations.\r\nAll helped in the war effort; even our frail Grandmother did her bit in\r\nhospital work. Later she spent a great deal of time in Kiev, with her\r\nyounger daughter Olga, our aunt, who worked in her own hospital there\r\nas a Sister of Mercy. Being so near the front, she received the most\r\ncritical cases.\r\n\r\nLife in the palace quickened. For days on end Mother could not think\r\nof anything but the hospitals. Were they adequate for the most certain\r\nstrain ahead? She was not ignorant of the heavy task. In her younger\r\ndays, before her marriage, she had taken up medicine for a while,\r\nknowing that the dreaded haemophilia might be in her genes. She wanted\r\nto be prepared to take personal care of any children she might have in\r\nthe event they should inherit it. Later on, through the long illness of\r\nAlexei and during the war, her previous knowledge of this affliction\r\nhelped enormously in her work. Mother also had a medical library on the\r\nsecond floor in Tsarskoe Selo, where in addition to texts, all kinds\r\nof anatomical diagrams and other materials could be found. Even before\r\nthe war she was an excellent organizer of hospitals and charitable\r\ninstitutions, being particularly interested in orphanages. In addition\r\nto her medical training, Mother had studied philosophy in one of the\r\nGerman universities. In fact I recall the very drawer in the desk in\r\na room on the balcony where she kept her documents and other papers\r\nof this nature. Most of all, I was always sure, Mother was determined\r\nto meet with courage any problems she had to face. So now, a nurses’\r\ncourse was arranged for Mother, Olga and Tatiana, so that they might\r\nserve the wounded more effectively.\r\n\r\nAlexei no longer played at soldiering. He was now in serious military\r\ntraining. In Father’s study there was always a chair for Alexei,\r\nwhere he sat on certain days listening to various reports brought\r\nby the Ministers. He was not allowed to make any comments at these\r\nconferences, although, after the Ministers left, he could ask questions\r\nabout anything that puzzled him.\r\n\r\n“If Alexei could take part in things, why not I?” Mother said,\r\n“During a war there are first duties. Yours is to continue your\r\neducation in order to be useful later on.” How disappointing. Yet\r\nthe war-electrified patriotism compelled me to dig in at my school\r\nwork and to pursue my formal education. Stirring sounds of bands and\r\nmarching feet often disturbed my good intentions. I learned the meaning\r\nof discipline and self-sacrifice from the men under arms.\r\n\r\nMy newly awakened conscientiousness would not let me waste a minute.\r\nBesides working on my lessons, I joined a group of young women in\r\nhemming children’s dresses for various charities. Later under Marie’s\r\nsupervision we worked in the palace workroom on garments and often we\r\ncalled officers of Father’s own regiment on duty in the palace to turn\r\nthe wheels of the sewing machines and sort the garments.\r\n\r\nWe had learned sewing at an early age because Mother had always\r\nstressed its importance in any woman’s life. She, herself, was expert\r\nat sewing and during the early years of her marriage made some of the\r\nlayettes for us infants. Many of her embroideries sold at benefits\r\nand some handmade blouses in silk or linen, beautifully tucked and\r\nembroidered, went as gifts to our relatives in England and in Germany.\r\n\r\nGrandmother, too, was clever at hand work. She could repair her own\r\nexquisite handkerchiefs so perfectly one would never know they had\r\nbeen mended. Grandmother could knit well, too; during the war she made\r\nfine woolen gloves for the soldiers and sent some to Father. Marie and\r\nI concentrated on socks, gloves, and caps, and received our war news\r\nwhile we were knitting in the evening. War and our mutual problems\r\nbecame the greatest teachers of responsibility. When I became the\r\nhonorary chief of a regiment, the 148th Caspian Infantry, the monthly\r\nreports I received of my regiment brought to me news of the losses in\r\ndead and wounded. These reports were frightening and I ran to Olga to\r\nfind what could be done to ease the situation. She said; “Hundreds of\r\nwounded are coming every day and it is horrible the way they suffer.” I\r\nheard that the German losses were even greater.\r\n\r\nOnce again I wanted to be a doctor when I grew up. Soon after this,\r\nMother allowed Marie and me to visit our own hospital more often. As\r\nwe entered the building they were carrying a wounded man with bloody\r\nbandages. He was taken directly to the operating room; a moment later\r\nthey carried him right out again. The doctors had found he was already\r\ndead when he was brought to the operating room. I had a dizzy spell.\r\nI was ill. No, I never could be a doctor. The sight of that poor boy\r\ncould never be erased from my mind. For weeks I could smell blood.\r\nRed became a haunting color with its reminder of the horror of that\r\npicture. Even red medicine made me ill all over again.\r\n\r\nDay after day Olga and Tatiana worked beside Mother at the hospital.\r\nThey got up at seven, attended lectures, and then again resumed their\r\nhospital work. In the evening, they read while knitting. I could not\r\nunderstand how they endured it all. It was comforting, however, to\r\nlearn that Olga, like me, could not bear to see suffering. Tatiana was\r\nlike Mother in her ability to see beyond the suffering to the relief\r\nshe was able to give. Doctors were scarce, and Mother assisted in many\r\noperations. Each day before going to the hospital she stopped at the\r\nZnamensky Sobor, the little church she had restored, to pray that her\r\nhands might be blessed with the power to do things right. She felt so\r\nobligated to each wounded soldier, she wanted to nurse him with her own\r\nhands to relieve his suffering. At the sight of each new patient she\r\nprayed anew for the war to end. She spent all day at the hospital and\r\ncame home exhausted and would lie on her sofa for a short rest.\r\n\r\nWith tragedy on all sides Father ordered strict economy. Every possible\r\nkopeck must be saved to benefit the soldiers. Mother reduced our staff\r\nof servants. Our meals became simpler. Father insisted that the Court,\r\nwithout exception, must observe all the restrictions. These economies\r\nwere not too difficult for us children, since we had not been brought\r\nup to expect extravagant luxuries. Mother had always preached to us\r\nagainst wastefulness, and against idleness. These ideals were now\r\nmore necessary. We accepted whatever we received with appreciation.\r\nWe had very few dresses. I wore the ones handed down from my sisters.\r\nBeing much smaller than they, the fit was not perfect and required\r\nalterations. A few tucks here and there made me happy in them. When we\r\ndid get a new dress we were so careful with it that we could hardly\r\nbear to sit down. Each of us had definite duties to perform.\r\n\r\nOlga and Tatiana continued their studies and carried on with their\r\nhospital work and also made out schedules for us younger sisters for\r\nthe next day. In addition they checked supplies for the hospitals,\r\nattended meetings for charitable organizations, and supervised the\r\nraising of money through concerts and plays. Many of the leading\r\nartists donated their services and large sums were raised for the\r\nexpanding hospitals and other charities. Our friend Madame Plevitskaya\r\nproved most helpful by generously donating her time and her talent to\r\nthe war effort. Mother eagerly awaited reports showing the financial\r\naccount of these benefits.\r\n\r\nMarie and I selected gramophone records to be sent to the convalescent\r\nwards, also books which the soldiers might like to read. We ordered\r\nfruit, candies, cakes, games, stationery, soap and pencils. Box after\r\nbox was taken to the hospitals. Sometimes we played dominoes with the\r\nmen, or watched those who could play croquet, or wrote letters to their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nOur playrooms were now deserted. Alexei’s electric automobile had been\r\nstored under the slide. His special duties kept him occupied, as did\r\nhis class work. When he did go for a ride, with a friend or with one of\r\nhis cousins, he made it appear as if they were engaged in an important\r\nwar project.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of war most gaiety ceased. Benefits became the\r\nsocial functions; anyone not helping was out of fashion. Everyone\r\nworked together to make each benefit a successful affair. To raise\r\nmoney, photographs of the Imperial family were sold. There were name\r\ndays set aside when one member of the family was played up throughout\r\nRussia; the newspapers helped in the competition. It was exciting to\r\nsee whose photographs sold best. Tatiana proved a great favorite with\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nMany relatives and friends turned their homes into hospitals, often\r\npaying the expenses themselves. In addition, they devoted all their\r\ntime to the wounded. Some had as many as seventy patients in their\r\nresidences. Olga designed an attractive calendar, each page gave the\r\nhistorical event of that day. It became a favorite and was ordered by\r\nthe thousand. Aunt Olga, Father’s sister, made drawings and paintings\r\nwhich brought large sums to charities. Moreover there were outright\r\ngifts in large amounts. A banker named Yaroshinsky donated over a\r\nquarter of a million rubles. Yaroshinsky was assistant manager of\r\nMother’s own hospital train. He reappears later in my memories of\r\nTobolsk and Ekaterinburg.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, before Father took over the Supreme Command of the Russian\r\nArmies in the Field, there were occasional officers’ balls. Father and\r\nMother attended these affairs but stayed only long enough to show their\r\ninterest in them, always having in mind that it might be their last\r\ngaiety. Marie and I were too young to attend any of these functions at\r\nthis time, but Olga and Tatiana went. When they were dressed to leave\r\nthey came to show themselves to Marie and me that we might have a\r\nlittle touch of festivity. Their joy in being gowned in evening clothes\r\ninstead of the customary nurse’s uniform made them radiantly happy.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes sparkled and their cheeks were flushed, making them look\r\nmore beautiful, so that I was sure each might meet her Prince. Mother\r\nalways wanted her daughters to be poised and act natural in the company\r\nof men. It was all so romantic, I could hardly wait until I, too, could\r\ngo to such affairs. My sisters looked every bit the princesses they\r\nwere, soft and graceful in manner, stately and tall, and we younger\r\nsisters had to be told about these parties over and over again in every\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nAunt Olga, Father’s sister, from the kindness of her heart realized,\r\nwhile the young men were at the front, the young ladies at home were\r\nmore than ever appreciative of a little gaiety. She, too, planned\r\nseveral parties at her home in Petrograd (the new name for St.\r\nPetersburg). These usually came on Sunday when we met a great many\r\nyoung people. At other times, we were asked to see stage plays at\r\nCountess Sheremetieva’s. The Countess was a close friend of our Aunt\r\nOlga. We had a wonderful time at these parties.\r\n\r\nAunt Olga was very close to us girls, more like a sister than an aunt,\r\nonly thirteen years older than my sister Olga. She understood the art\r\nof living; she was full of life and gaiety; her visits brought joy to\r\nour lives. When she left, it seemed all the fun went with her. She\r\nloved sports; besides tennis she liked skating and skiing; she played\r\na good game of billiards, often with her mother; also croquet and\r\nmany other games. She was an excellent painter. Her religious art was\r\nappreciated by many churches. She was a woman of deep faith and loved\r\nher religion. Mother and Aunt Olga often talked about religion. The\r\nlatter had a good voice and played several instruments. An excellent\r\nlinguist she spoke at that time Russian, English, French and had some\r\ncommand of both Danish and German.\r\n\r\nHer love for peasants was great. She disliked formality, and was happy\r\nto by-pass the rules of etiquette, which were forced upon the royal\r\nfamilies. She considered them old-fashioned. She loved to dress like\r\na peasant. Because of her liberal views she became a target of cheap\r\ngossip. Her husband, Prince Peter of Oldenburg, was chronically ill.\r\nUncle Peter was tremendously rich, but all his wealth could not give\r\nher the child she so longed for. For this marriage my Grandmother was\r\nresponsible. Finally and after fifteen years of marriage the Grand\r\nDuchess obtained an annulment, against my Father’s wishes, and married\r\nColonel Nicholai Koulikovsky, a tall handsome officer, who was her\r\nformer husband’s aide-de-camp and the head of her hospital in Kiev.\r\nFor this she was criticized by gossiping women, but Aunt Olga felt it\r\nwas her own affair and not that of the women who did nothing good in\r\ntheir lifetime but interfered with the lives of others. Prince Peter\r\nindeed was nice but companionship alone was not enough to make their\r\nmarriage completely successful. This condition caused a strained family\r\nrelationship, and she was eventually to be exiled. But while we were\r\nin Tobolsk even Father wrote to her.\r\n\r\nWhile Grandmother was in Petrograd, even for a short visit, she\r\nutilized her time folding bandages with her companions. Olga and\r\nTatiana after their meetings in the Winter Palace often drove to\r\nthe Anichkov Palace to take tea with Granny. They brought us news\r\nof her. When she was not well, Mother sent us children to see her.\r\nWe took along some delicacies as a present. For some reason I felt\r\nuncomfortable and self-conscious in Grandmother’s presence. I could not\r\nhelp but admire her; she carried herself in such a stately manner in\r\nher pretty clothes, mostly black.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the war, Mother took us to Moscow to see\r\nour Aunt Ella (Elizabeth), whose husband, the Grand Duke Serge, was\r\nmurdered by a bomb. I did not remember Aunt Ella in any other way than\r\nin a nun’s costume with its finely draped habit covering her hair\r\nentirely. Her features were beautiful and symmetrical. Many highly\r\ntitled men would have given anything if she would but consider a second\r\nmarriage; some even made suggestions to Mother who, knowing her sister,\r\nrealized it was useless.\r\n\r\nI learned a great deal of history from her. She told us that when she\r\nfirst came to Russia as the bride of Serge Alexandrovich, she studied\r\nthe Greek Orthodox religion with the court priest for several years\r\nbefore she felt sufficiently versed in it to join the Church. The night\r\nbefore Uncle Serge’s name day, she said to him, “I have a gift for your\r\nname day.” “A piece of jewelry?” “No, my dear, something more precious\r\nto you.” At breakfast next morning she said, “My gift to you today is\r\nmy embracing the Greek Orthodox religion.” Uncle Serge replied: “This\r\nis the happiest day of my life since our marriage.”\r\n\r\nIn 1914 when Aunt Ella was with us in the Crimea, she told us sisters\r\nthat during the Japanese war Uncle Serge offered to take command of the\r\narmy, confident that he would win and prevent a civil war. But Count\r\nWitte, the Prime Minister, opposed it. A controversy ensued and the two\r\nmen became enemies. After the signing of the peace treaty, which was\r\nencouraged by the President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nUncle Serge and Count Witte fought over it.\r\n\r\nSoon after this someone threw a bomb at Uncle Serge as he was leaving\r\nthe Kremlin in a sleigh. Aunt Ella heard the explosion and she knew\r\nit was intended for her husband. This occurred just outside the gate.\r\nShe and her lady in waiting ran out to find only the remnants of his\r\nbody which the two gathered with their bare hands for burial. They also\r\ngathered the pieces of his torn uniform which Aunt Ella enclosed in a\r\nholder in the shape of a cross and later kept in her convent cell. It\r\nwas after his death that Aunt Ella went into the convent of Martha and\r\nMary. From then on she wore a habit of her order in soft pale gray,\r\nwhich was artistically draped around her head. She thought Count Witte\r\nwas behind the man who killed her husband. Yet she forgave them. She\r\neven sent food, cigarettes, and clothing to the prisoners who had\r\nmurdered her husband and frequently went to visit them in prison in\r\nspite of Father’s objections.\r\n\r\nMany sufferings and much unrest took place while Count Witte was\r\nPrime Minister (1905-6). Madame Narishkina often spoke to us children\r\nabout the opening of the Duma in 1906. She said that at the time\r\nMother, Grandmother and many others cried when during a reception\r\npeople marched to the Tauride Palace singing the revolutionary song.\r\nShe said, “Witte gave all the power to the Duma, and because of the\r\ncharacter of this power the Duma was dissolved in 1906.” But it left\r\nthe most damaging results, and these effects germinated and were ripe\r\nat the opening of the Fourth Duma in 1912. Witte was still living at\r\nthat time. Even during the war the Duma so jeopardized the life of the\r\nnation that finally it collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe news from the front was for a time encouraging; there was talk of a\r\nshort war. People seemed to work harder than ever. At this time Father\r\nwas often summoned to the telephone which he did not want to have on\r\nhis desk in his study. Even while Father was on his daily short walks,\r\nfrequently an officer on a velocipede was dispatched to fetch him on an\r\nurgent matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX FAMILY HEARTACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news from the front was bad. There were serious reverses. Father\r\nwas staggered. The people and the army were dissatisfied with Grand\r\nDuke Nicholai Nicholaevich, who was in command of the Russian armies at\r\nthe front. A change had become imperative.\r\n\r\nMy father now decided to take over the Supreme Command of the Russian\r\nArmies in the Field. He realized that a tragic hour was at hand. The\r\nArmy already had begun to show disunity, under the Grand Duke Nicholai\r\nNicholaevich who continually complained about Father, not only to\r\nGrandmother and our Aunts but also to the officers of the high command.\r\nFather thought that this older giant who was at least 6′ 4′′, would be\r\nbetter off in the warmer climate of the Persian front as he suffered\r\nfrom rheumatism. But the Grand Duke claimed that Father was jealous of\r\nhis position.\r\n\r\nFather’s decision meant going to General Headquarters and entrusting\r\nthe government to others in his absence, hoping for the wholehearted\r\nsupport of the Duma. It also meant separation from the family. Mother\r\nbelieved completely that this was the correct decision, but never from\r\nthat moment on was she free from constant worry.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure Mother drove with Father to the Cathedral of Sts.\r\nPeter and Paul, then to Our Lady of Kazan to pray for guidance in his\r\nundertaking and to dedicate all, even life itself, to the task. Then\r\nthey crossed the Troitsky bridge over the Neva, which was built as a\r\nmemorial to the silver wedding anniversary of Alexander III and Marie\r\nFeodorovna.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mother believed she saw the sign of a cross in the sky.\r\nThis saddened her, for she became worried that Father by taking command\r\nwould encounter personal danger. She dreaded lest he become the victim\r\nof some fanatic assassin, as was his grandfather, Alexander II.\r\n\r\nWe realized this risk when we went to the Alexander Station to see\r\nFather entrain for Mogilev. The waiting room was filled with guards\r\nand secret police. No one was admitted except by special permit. Even\r\nministers and relatives could not enter except by invitation. When the\r\nbig, blue, Imperial train, with its double eagle crest, pulled out of\r\nthe station, we saw Father standing at the wide window of his sitting\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to know that each hundred feet of track was guarded by\r\na soldier against accidents or bombs. No one knew in which car Father\r\nrode. All the church bells rang until the train was no longer in sight.\r\nThe Nicholas railway on which they travelled provided a direct line to\r\nGeneral Headquarters. Several days before the trip, roads were searched\r\nand guards were posted. As a further precaution, railroad tracks\r\ncrossing the Nicholas line were removed until Father’s train passed.\r\nOnce he said, “I have known from my early years that I will fall a\r\nvictim for my country.” Nevertheless, Father disliked all the fuss.\r\n\r\nWith Father speeding away from us, we knew he would carry on\r\nefficiently and with determination. Of course he would miss his family,\r\nbut we were going to send him letters daily and an occasional package\r\ncontaining needed articles. We often sent him fruit and books and\r\noccasionally flowers received from Livadia. I can still hear Mother\r\nsay, as she examined the flowers while placing them in the box,\r\n“When one sees these heavenly blossoms, how can one be reconciled to\r\nthis terrible war?” Whatever went into each package was lovingly and\r\ntenderly packed; and Father knew it. Mother often packed everything\r\nwith her own hands and made a list of what she included. A jaeger\r\n(messenger), an aide-de-camp, or a relative waited until it was ready.\r\nMother sometimes handed the package to him personally and he departed\r\nto the undisclosed destination where Father was. There was always a\r\nletter in the package, describing our activities, sometimes only a\r\nnote from Mother, containing a language just the two of them could\r\nunderstand, words that made her love sing in Father’s heart.\r\n\r\nIn going to General Headquarters, Father discarded all conventionality.\r\nHe went behind the lines to fight with his men in arms. He took it as a\r\nmatter of faith that it was his duty to sacrifice everything in order\r\nto save Russia. He promised to do so the day he took the Crown. He\r\nsaid, “I shall not allow my people to be insulted and to be trampled\r\nupon by the enemy.”\r\n\r\nHis cheerful disposition gave great inspiration and happiness to the\r\nArmy whom he loved more than his family; here he found happiness among\r\nhis men in arms.\r\n\r\nWe heard of victories. Surely the war would soon end especially since\r\nreports from the front showed that prisoners were captured by tens of\r\nthousands at a time. “A supreme success,” Father wrote home. No wonder\r\na few months later the Kaiser wanted to sign a peace.\r\n\r\nSpring, 1916. Father sent word it would be impossible for him to\r\nbe with us at Easter. This was his first absence from home at this\r\nimportant holiday, which in the Greek Orthodox religion is celebrated\r\nmore fervently than Christmas. Instead he sent Mother a gift from\r\nG.H.Q., a most beautiful Easter egg, which he himself had designed.\r\nIt was indeed a rare gift, made by Fabergé himself because his many\r\nworkers were at the front and some of them had been killed. M. Fabergé\r\ndelivered it in person, and, in our presence, Mother opened the\r\nbeautifully wrapped package and exclaimed, “It is exquisite. How can\r\nhuman hands make such a beautiful work of art?” Then, when she opened\r\nthe egg itself, five dainty miniatures of us children unfolded in a\r\nrow. Father had remembered Mother’s expressed wish to own a miniature\r\nof us children. M. Fabergé beamed with pleasure, as did Mother and we\r\nchildren. That Easter the service was held by Father Vassiliev at the\r\nFeodorovsky Sobor and we all took Communion.\r\n\r\nEaster afternoon was the customary time to distribute gifts to the\r\nhospital patients. These consisted of china eggs and real eggs and some\r\nsweets. We “tied” hundreds of the special china eggs. They had been\r\ndecorated with the gold-crested double eagle with Mother’s initials\r\non one side and the Red Cross emblem on the other. Usually they had\r\nthe hole lengthwise from one end to the other so that a ribbon could\r\nbe pulled through to be suspended below an icon under which there was\r\na burning lamp (lampadka). Also, special Easter eggs were made by\r\nFabergé, and Father distributed them to the Allied Mission as well as\r\nto deserving men. Mother, too, sent some of these to Petrograd to the\r\nEnglish Hospital for Lady Sybil Grey so that she might give them to her\r\npatients. Mother also sent a beautifully hand-painted one to Lady Sybil\r\nherself in appreciation for her excellent work at the hospital, also to\r\nLady Buchanan. Our household maids received gold enamel bijou trinkets;\r\nmany girls wore a necklace of them for six weeks preceding Ascension\r\nDay.\r\n\r\nThis particular Easter afternoon, a little family argument ensued\r\nbetween Mother and Olga, who wanted to wear a pretty dress for this\r\noccasion. Mother insisted that Olga and Tatiana wear their nurse’s\r\nuniforms as usual. There were pleadings, opinions, and disagreements,\r\nbut Mother stood her ground. We all went to the hospital to which we\r\nwere assigned and we sisters agreed among ourselves that Mother was\r\nwrong and unfair to deny a change for the two young girls, who would\r\nhave found pleasure in appearing before the patients in a different\r\ndress. In the evening, Alexei came running into our bedroom. He was\r\nexcited and upset. He informed us that “Olga was crying.” He ran to\r\nhis tutor’s room and returned. We rushed into her bedroom and tried to\r\ncomfort her, assuring her that we felt Mother had been unjust. Olga\r\nsoon forgot the whole thing and Mother never knew of our indignation.\r\n\r\nMother worried about Father’s loneliness, in the midst of\r\nresponsibilities and without the comforts of home and family. However,\r\nMother was quite surprised when Father wrote that he had no time to\r\nbe lonely, and that, on his next trip home, he would take Alexei with\r\nhim to G.H.Q. M. Gilliard, his Swiss tutor, and others would accompany\r\nAlexei, so that his studies need not be neglected. Dina Derevenko and\r\nNagorny would watch over him. Dr. Fedorov was already at G.H.Q. as\r\nFather’s physician and also as lecturer to the Headquarters hospital\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\nThe more Mother thought on this subject the more reasonable it seemed\r\nto her. Alexei would learn military science first hand. He would get\r\nacquainted with officers and men, and learn about war in general and\r\nforeign representatives in particular. Above all, he would be the best\r\npossible company for his Father. So Alexei left home--in tears. It was\r\nthe first time he had been separated from Mother. While Alexei was\r\naway, Mother would slip into his room every day and pray on her knees\r\nbeside his empty bed. His absence was a heartrending experience for\r\nher. We tried hard to comfort and console her by showing how much we,\r\ntoo, missed the little fellow.\r\n\r\nSo Alexei joined his Papa, but now Mother’s worries began to increase.\r\nShe telephoned almost every day, asking about Father’s and Alexei’s\r\nhealth. She wondered whether Alexei was getting the proper food, having\r\nenough sleep. Was he careful, or was Father too busy to pay attention\r\nto Alexei? In spite of these worries she was proud to hear that they\r\nwere together, sharing the same room.\r\n\r\nWhile Mother worried, Alexei was proud of his association with Father.\r\nWe discovered it when we arrived in Mogilev. With great pride Alexei\r\nshowed us his bed beside Father’s, then added, “We say our prayers\r\ntogether, too. But sometimes, when I am tired and forget, Papa says\r\nthem for both of us.” He could not wait to show us photographs of\r\nhimself standing beside Father reviewing troops and partaking of\r\nthe soldiers’ rations. Father was proud to show Russia what a real\r\nTsarevich she had in Alexei and the tender relationship between Father\r\nand son and the country. This made Mother proud enough to endure the\r\nheartache of the little boy’s absence from home. Alexei remained at\r\nGeneral Headquarters.\r\n\r\nMother talked constantly about her “boys” at the hospitals. They were\r\nall her boys. On her trips to nursing centers to visit the wounded,\r\nOlga and Tatiana accompanied her when she made her rounds. When the\r\nsickrooms were on the second floor, she had to be carried upstairs\r\nin a wheel chair. She was their symbol of courage, representing home\r\nand loved ones, and they died in peace. When the day was done she was\r\nexhausted, but it seemed to mean so much to the men that the Empress\r\nherself cared so deeply for their welfare. She could never face death\r\nphilosophically. She considered each death as that of her own son, each\r\ndeath a fresh cause to despair at the futility of war and the greed of\r\nWilhelm.\r\n\r\nShe was a very good Christian and followed the religious teaching, but\r\ntowards the Kaiser she disregarded all the teachings of Christianity\r\nand her hatred for him was beyond description.\r\n\r\nMother, seeing all the young on the verge of death, suffered\r\nvicariously with them, and spent many sleepless nights pacing the\r\nfloor. Often in the darkness of the night, she ordered her chauffeur to\r\ndrive her to the cemetery. From grave to grave this tall shadow went\r\nand said a prayer in this quiet place for the young men. She knew them\r\nall and grieved over the loss of the lives they gave to their country.\r\nShe often sent us sisters to plant flowers on the graves of these men;\r\nthey were all her children.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe more deeply nor find words that could give a better\r\nunderstanding and do justice to this much misunderstood woman. She\r\ninsisted upon being present at the most gruesome operations. Carefully\r\nshe handed the instruments to the surgeon, while one of my sisters\r\nstood by with the freshly threaded needles ready for use. Mother,\r\nlooking upon these heartrending scenes, tried to give her very inner\r\nself to these sons and husbands and brothers of Russia. So did the\r\nnurses who worked heroically in our hospitals or public institutions,\r\npractically all of them volunteers. Mother never postponed taking care\r\nof important matters. She checked the reports on supplies for the\r\nhospitals to see if they were sufficient.\r\n\r\nMother had at first considered the question of the duration of Alexei’s\r\nstay at G.H.Q. Now she planned a hospital inspection tour in the area,\r\nso that she would be able to bring him home. But Father and General\r\nHanbury-Williams asked Mother to let the little boy stay at G.H.Q. We\r\nleft for home without Alexei.\r\n\r\nWhen Father was absent for any reason, General Alexeiev was in complete\r\ncommand. All military matters were discussed between them; they worked\r\ntogether congenially. A number of times Father took Alexei with him to\r\ninspect the troops of Generals Ivanov and Brussilov and to decorate all\r\nthose involved in heroic action with crosses. The soldiers were quite\r\nimpressed with Alexei. In the uniform of a private, he stood proudly\r\nbeside Father during military reviews. By the erectness of his posture\r\nand the tenseness of his expression, it was obvious he felt deeply\r\nresponsible. They returned to G.H.Q. from the front, which was within\r\nthe range of German guns. Fortunately the Kaiser did not know this.\r\nFather insisted that his food come from the field kitchen--the same\r\nthat the soldiers had.\r\n\r\nMy sisters continued working; when they were tired they rested on\r\nlittle stools at a bedside reading, praying for the sick, or writing\r\nletters if the patients were unable to do so. Olga was deliberate in\r\nher decisions and very exact in all her work. She was responsible and\r\nsuccessful in raising a great deal of money by her carefully planned\r\nprograms of entertainment, which were always carried out successfully.\r\nTatiana who was physically stronger was prone to take the lead in their\r\nhospital work. We heard from doctors that she was unusually gifted\r\nin this type of work, took everything calmly and systematically and\r\nwith a clear head. Mother always counted on her to carry out the most\r\npressing work with accuracy, and she never failed.\r\n\r\nMother also used to sit with the sick men for hours and when the\r\nofficers were returning to the front, Mother was introduced to\r\neach as he passed her and gave him a prayer book. Standing next to\r\nMother, Madame Narishkina gave each one a package containing a set of\r\nunderwear, made out of silk in the “Marie-Anastasia Workshop.” It was\r\nto protect them from body lice, mainly at the front.\r\n\r\nAlexei, when home, visited the wounded often at our hospital. He\r\nenjoyed listening to the men of war speak of their experiences at the\r\nfront, never tired of hearing stories. Often he told them jokes to make\r\nthem laugh. He felt indignant when the time came to leave, when the\r\nmerriment might only have begun.\r\n\r\nAs to our trips no one knew the date of our departure or return. Count\r\nFredericks, Minister of the Court, made all the arrangements. In\r\nthe fall we left for an inspection of different military hospitals,\r\nstopping on our way in Mogilev. We made our headquarters on the train\r\nwhich stood on the track in a deep forest, some distance from the\r\nstation. A few days later, Father and Alexei returned home with us.\r\nThe many dangerous trips to the front, the sight of the wounded in the\r\nhospitals, and the feeling of responsibility made a deep impression on\r\nAlexei, causing him to be nervous.\r\n\r\nWhile at home, Father had a long talk with Olga, and asked her to see\r\nthat Mother kept all those hated people out of our house. But Mother,\r\nthinking they were helping her, continued to have them. Olga disliked\r\nRasputin, never wanting his name brought up in her presence. When our\r\ncompany mentioned his name she changed the conversation. Once I heard\r\nher say to Mother, “Why do you listen to some of these women? Their\r\nminds and upbringing are so different from yours. Why do they come to\r\nyou with all kinds of gossip? In their position, they should not be\r\npermitted to interfere with things that do not concern them.”\r\n\r\nMother answered, “But, my dear, every ruler must have contact with the\r\npeople outside. That is the only way to get at the truth. Granny (Queen\r\nVictoria) had confidential informers, and consequently knew everything\r\nthat was going on.”\r\n\r\nOlga replied, “That is all right, Mother, but these people were not\r\nconstantly in Granny’s company. Especially we like to have a visit with\r\nFather when he is home for a short period. You must keep your public\r\nand private lives separate.”\r\n\r\nThese unworthy, capricious people irritated Olga when they became\r\ninvolved in matters about which they knew nothing. Their careless words\r\nlater ignited a devastating flame. Marie often was reprimanded because\r\nof friction with one of them who was a constant friend of Mother’s.\r\n\r\nSoon Father and Alexei left for an inspection at the front; they went\r\nas far as Chernovitsy, Bukovina, where I spent some time after my\r\nescape. Could Father ever have dreamed that a child of his would ask\r\nshelter near this battered city? He was also in Warsaw, and described\r\nthe battle in that area to us. He brought back many pictures, showing,\r\nas I recall, on one side of a road thousands of crosses on the graves\r\nof Russian soldiers and on the other side the enemy’s graves. We prayed\r\nGod that our men would be able to defend our country.\r\n\r\nMy parents visited the Red Cross units and ambulance trains for\r\nthe evacuation of the wounded village people and went to the field\r\nhospitals to say a few encouraging words to the wounded. Mother and\r\nwe sisters carried envelopes containing writing paper, handkerchiefs,\r\nsweets, fruit and other articles for distribution. Father depended\r\non us sisters for these supplies. Ambulance trains were named after\r\nus children and the train was met by that person whose name it bore.\r\nOften these trains arrived simply packed with the wounded who in some\r\ncases were even lying on the floors which were covered with straw and\r\nblankets. Frequently infections set in, when flesh was torn and bones\r\nwere shattered. German bullets usually made a jagged hole, tearing the\r\nflesh. Russian bullets made a clean cut. Infections were especially\r\nprevalent during springtime when the snow had melted and the trenches\r\nwere filled with polluted water which made it impossible for the men\r\nto lie down. It was difficult to move the wounded along roads cut up\r\nby the heavy artillery. Instead muddy fields had to be used for their\r\ntransportation to the nearest hospital or the train; often the mobile\r\nhospital got stuck in the field and the rescue work had to be done in\r\nthe dark. It was heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nEvery possible space was used. Even the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo had to be utilized. Mother also had built many new hospitals with\r\nFather’s and her own money; she appointed Madame Zizi Narishkina as the\r\nhead of the hospitals. Mother also established refugee homes for the\r\nunfortunates whose farms were plundered and laid waste by artillery.\r\nFor the evacuated village people, shelters and orphanages, hospitals\r\nand convalescent homes were constructed. She had built about ninety\r\nmilitary hospitals from Petrograd down into the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nMany men released from the hospital were unable to return to the front.\r\nSome of them were sent to farms and trades. Others learned to paint\r\nand their pictures were bought and sold at different bazaars; some\r\nwere taught to weave rugs; others did wood carving; still others took\r\nup sculpture, photography, printing or bookkeeping. All this was made\r\npossible through the organized efforts of my family.\r\n\r\nGrandmother and other members of the Imperial family did the same. She\r\neven built camps in Germany to house Russian prisoners of war there.\r\nBut a Red Cross doctor and a nurse returned from Germany with a report\r\nof the terrible conditions, the mistreatment of prisoners, and the lack\r\nof heat and sanitation. They said that many wounded were infected with\r\nsores and no nurses were permitted to help them. Officers were insulted\r\nand beaten, because they refused to give the Germans information as to\r\nthe situation at the front. One of the Kaiser’s sons was present and\r\nsaw all these conditions and indignities. Over the Russian prisoners\r\nthe Germans put Russian Jews, who had run away to avoid serving in the\r\narmy. The mistreatment of the prisoners was unbelievable.\r\n\r\nThrough the Red Cross, Mother sent supplies to these camps in Germany\r\nincluding Bibles, books, bandages and other necessities. She also\r\nhelped to organize camps near the railroad stations in Siberia for\r\nGerman and Austrian prisoners of war; many such prisoners were sent\r\nto work on farms. These camps were well regulated as she was eager\r\nto demonstrate that Russia could lead in the humane treatment of\r\nprisoners. For this she was deeply criticized on the ground that she\r\nwas saving the lives of our enemy. Maybe later the same men were the\r\nkillers of her own family.\r\n\r\nOften my sisters came with a story of some unusual occurrences. One\r\nyoung patient coming out of anesthesia sang and moved his arms as if\r\nconducting an orchestra. When he was told later what he had done and\r\nthat Mother was present, he apologized, fearing he might have used some\r\nvulgar words. Another said that he had received a letter from his girl\r\nfriend. He kept on repeating all the sweet words only a bride-to-be can\r\nwrite to her fiancé.\r\n\r\nWe looked forward to the evening when we could snuggle around Mother\r\nin her room. Usually there was a letter from Father. These arrived by\r\nspecial messenger and were delivered to Mother by Mother’s ladies in\r\nwaiting or maids. Mother read parts to us and afterwards seemed more\r\ncontented. She preferred to open her own personal mail. Mother eyed\r\nher other letters with suspicion, turning them over. When she read\r\na line or two, her face grew dark, her eyes flashed anger; she tore\r\nthem to bits and threw them in the wastebasket. With all the misery in\r\nthe world, many found time to criticize her and were too cowardly to\r\nsign their name. God forgive them for the unpleasant hours they caused\r\nMother, not to mention the injury to our war effort. She said the\r\nGermans used the same method of propaganda as did the Japanese in 1905.\r\n\r\nFather never allowed us girls to discuss these unpleasant matters. Once\r\nwhen Father was absent, I mimicked one of the suspected trouble-makers.\r\nI was promptly reprimanded, then everyone burst out in laughter. My\r\ntechnique worked. The next morning Mother’s eyes were red and swollen.\r\nShe said she had read late and her eyes hurt. It was obvious to us\r\nthat she had cried herself to sleep. We four sisters got off a letter\r\nto Father begging him to come home for a day or two. Father and Alexei\r\narrived. Now Mother was a new person. She gave all her heart and soul\r\nto Father, and Alexei’s entertaining chatter lifted her spirits. Her\r\neyes were no longer red and swollen; instead they glistened. Evenings\r\nfound the whole family gathered together in Mother’s boudoir. If one\r\nhad looked in, he would have been impressed by the harmony in that room.\r\n\r\nMother expressed her wish to have a little house, away from everybody,\r\nwhere she could have peace and quiet. We wished so, too. Mother’s and\r\nFather’s love for each other would have made a home out of any humble\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nAll too soon Father had to leave. Alexei was so diverting, we wished\r\nwe could keep him home, but the little fellow was too proud of his\r\nassociation with Father even to listen to such a suggestion. Good-byes\r\nwere hard on Mother, and we often wondered whether we had been wise in\r\nasking Father to come from G.H.Q. After he left, Mother prayed daily\r\nfor his safe return; she was proud of his service to the country.\r\n\r\nAlmost on the very day of Father’s departure, the anonymous letters\r\nbegan to come in greater numbers. Mother almost dreaded reading the\r\nnumerous letters because of their venomous content. One of the letters\r\nwas signed by Princess Vasilchikova. She accused Mother of many things\r\nand claimed to be speaking for the women of Petrograd. She suggested\r\nthat Mother leave Russia and go back to Germany where she had come\r\nfrom. How little she knew that Mother came from the little province of\r\nHesse and had no connection with Prussia. I wondered what this woman\r\nthought the Empress’ children would do? Obviously this and other\r\nletters were inspired by those who wanted to overthrow the Imperial\r\nfamily and its government in order to gain control of the country, as\r\nthey eventually did.\r\n\r\nMother even was accused of sitting behind a curtain at the top of the\r\nstairway of her maple sitting room which let into Father’s study,\r\nlistening to all the reports given Father on the progress on the war.\r\nThese reports she was supposed to transmit to Kaiser Wilhelm. This\r\nridiculous gossip was not only believed by many in Russia but was even\r\ncirculated in foreign countries. The story was so impossible it hardly\r\nneeds refuting. To reach the spot, Mother would have had to climb some\r\ndozen steps to the top of the balcony room, which she could not have\r\ndone because of her heart condition. Besides, Mother never was left\r\nalone. She always had a personal attendant with her on duty, day and\r\nnight. In a room next to Mother’s bedchamber, a bell was connected\r\nwith the maid’s room in which there was a narrow bed and a comfortable\r\narmchair; also a small table on which were magazines and books for the\r\nmaid’s relaxation. The other personnel were dismissed at 11:00 P.M.\r\nMost of her help had been with Mother since her marriage; we parted\r\nwith some, when we left for Tobolsk. Her loyalty to her adopted country\r\nwas unquestionable and her personal dislike for the Kaiser and his\r\ngovernment was almost an obsession with her.\r\n\r\nAnother rumor, freely circulated, was to the effect that Mother had\r\nbeen visited secretly by the German General Ludendorff. This and many\r\nother similar rumors were part of the propaganda to destroy Russia by\r\nattacking the heart of the Russian government. Mother was depressed and\r\nexhausted as these accusations multiplied. Some of the writers demanded\r\nthe discharge of all officials with foreign names. This would have\r\nmeant dismissing people like faithful Trina Schneider whose loyalty\r\nwas beyond suspicion. In the end she, too, was killed outside of Perm.\r\nShe had taught both Mother and Aunt Ella the Russian language. Now she\r\nserved as a reader and a governess to Marie and myself. Some of the\r\npeople had German names but were Scandinavian; others were descendants\r\nof people brought to Russia during the reign of Catherine the Great.\r\n\r\nWith Father at G.H.Q., there was much he could not follow first hand.\r\nMother felt she must report to him everything that came to her notice.\r\nAll the praise, criticism, advice, countless suggestions of many\r\nindividuals were brought to her that she might pass them on to Father.\r\nSometimes these were important messages, sometimes they were petty and\r\ntrivial in comparison with the momentous questions that confronted\r\nthe nation. Mother was eager for advice but unfortunately most of the\r\nsuggestions came from those she had the least reason to trust, persons\r\nwho were suspected of being the real instigators of the propaganda\r\nagainst her. More and more she felt that most of those who volunteered\r\nto advise her were serving their own self-interest.\r\n\r\nReports often brought depressing information: that Father’s orders, his\r\ntelegrams, were purposely sabotaged, and often were replaced by others.\r\nInefficiency and betrayals were noticeable. Father was frequently\r\nimposed upon as a result of his kindness and generosity. Mother\r\nsaid, “He must make his will felt, inspire wholesome fear through\r\nfirmness and discipline. To inspire love is not enough.” With her own\r\nbackground Mother often wished that Russia had some of the efficiency\r\nof the Germans. She thought Russia needed more ingenuity and greater\r\neconomic independence. She felt the need of more railroads for the\r\ntransportation of troops and supplies, though one Siberian line had\r\njust been completed during the war (in 1915).\r\n\r\nPetrograd was full of crosscurrents. One said this, another said that.\r\nMother did not know whom she should believe. In spite of slanders that\r\nwere heaped on her, she still wanted to find out the truth to pass\r\non to Father. The people were tired, tired of everything, especially\r\nof war. Whatever the reason, they were in a careless mood in their\r\nattitude toward their country. No one had brought proof to back\r\nup their accusations of Anna and Rasputin. These two, in Mother’s\r\nopinion, were continually persecuted. Had not Anna given every kopeck\r\nof her compensation for injury in a terrible train wreck to establish\r\na hospital for convalescent soldiers so that they might receive\r\ntraining in some trade? The hospital was so successful that before the\r\nRevolution hundreds of invalids had been trained and she had purchased\r\nthe land on which to build an additional building. What greater proof\r\nof her loyalty was needed? Could anyone know better than Mother the\r\npower of Rasputin’s prayers? Had she not witnessed his miracle on\r\nAlexei? Now all she wanted for Father was divine guidance to see things\r\nstraight and to bring Russia safely through this ordeal. Had not\r\nRasputin used his foreknowledge which made him see what others could\r\nnot? He had foretold several events which later came true. Once he\r\npredicted that our death would follow his death and that in the event\r\nof a member of the family surviving, he or she would meet with disaster\r\nin 1960.\r\n\r\nAnother accusation was that Mother was hiding Uncle Ernest in the\r\npalace. Uncle Ernie had been in Russia with his family in 1912.\r\nIt was at the new palace in the Crimea. That was the last time he\r\nvisited Russia. During the war, the Kaiser made it so disagreeable\r\nfor Uncle Ernest that, in 1918, he abdicated. He and his father had\r\nworked so hard to make their country economically sound. We had a few\r\nletters from Aunt Victoria, Mother’s sister in England. Prince Louis\r\nof Battenberg, her husband, was the First Sea Lord of the British\r\nAdmiralty. Pressure was brought against him also during the war\r\nhysteria so that he was forced to resign his commission, in spite of\r\nhis loyalty to his adopted country, Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhen the war broke out, the Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich\r\nand his wife were in Germany. They were subjected to considerable\r\nmistreatment so that, a year after, he died. Father was furious when\r\nhe received the report of the abuses from the Grand Duke himself.\r\nGrandmother also was passing through Germany at the outbreak of the\r\nwar, and she, too, was subjected to the same indignities. The death of\r\nthe Grand Duke Constantine was a great loss, not only to the family,\r\nbut to all Russia. The Grand Duke was a most brilliant scholar, poet\r\nand patron of music and drama. He wrote plays, essays, poems, using\r\na pseudonym. He translated _Hamlet_ into Russian. He wrote a play\r\nentitled _King of Judea_. It was a magnificent production, in which he\r\ntook part. Even when his health was failing, he continued to promote\r\nthe arts. The last production in which I saw him on the stage was\r\n_Hamlet_. He played the leading role of the Danish Prince himself. Some\r\nof his children had parts in it. During the last performance my family\r\nwas present. Alexei sat with Mother in the front row and excitedly\r\ncalled out, “Mother, Mother, do you know that is Uncle Constantine! And\r\nthat _there_ is an officer of the Guards?” Uncle Constantine sponsored\r\na number of young people in music and drama. He had a theatre of his\r\nown and designed his own stage settings.\r\n\r\nHe was deeply religious and brought up his family in the best Christian\r\ntradition. Despite his good life he suffered great misfortune. Shortly\r\nbefore he died, his son-in-law was killed in the war. Earlier, one of\r\nhis sons, Prince Oleg, had been a battle casualty. While the Germans\r\nwere retreating Oleg followed them on his horse when a wounded German\r\nofficer played dead and shot him; he soon died in the hospital. The\r\nnames of his children were all taken from early history. During the\r\nrevolution, three more sons were brutally murdered, together with Aunt\r\nElla, near Alapaevsk.\r\n\r\nI remember Aunt Mavra, Constantine’s wife, and one of her daughters\r\nhaving tea with us for the last time, shortly before the revolution.\r\nAlways deeply religious, they crossed themselves for safe driving\r\nbefore they entered their car. Whoever could have known that we would\r\nnever see one another again? Still Aunt Mavra lived through all the\r\ntragedy that befell her innocent family.\r\n\r\nMother seldom came to the dinner table these days. She was served\r\nin one of her rooms and we joined her after the meal. At that time\r\nFather’s letters were read and reread. Usually there was a clever one\r\nfrom Alexei, too. His note was always so cheering to Mother that we\r\nhoped she could retain the mood till bedtime. To break the monotony, I\r\nplanned on entertaining them, even though it made me feel sad rather\r\nthan lighthearted, but, once I started, everybody began to laugh and we\r\nwere soon all in the midst of great merriment.\r\n\r\nWatching Mother carefully, when she looked troubled, I sprang a new\r\njoke or some lighthearted remark to cheer her up again. In this\r\nself-appointed task I had a helper. I found a book of funny stories,\r\nwhich I kept in one of the drawers in the round table in the music\r\nroom, and in privacy I delved through it. It contained many jokes which\r\nI did not understand, but, believing they must be funny, I put my own\r\ninterpretation upon these and tried them out on the family in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nOn Father’s last trip to the capital, his appearance before the Duma\r\nwas a great success. In his speech he urged unity and warned that only\r\nunity would bring victory--the victory he reminded them was so near.\r\nHearing his inspiring message, everyone was optimistic. There was\r\ncountry-wide rejoicing, especially when shortly afterward the news came\r\nthat Erzerum, which had been stubbornly held by the Turks for so long,\r\nhad fallen.\r\n\r\nFather said that he was willing to grant liberal concessions but he\r\nfeared that this was not the time for great, radical changes. They\r\nwould have too damaging an effect during wartime.\r\n\r\nSir John Hanbury-Williams was in Petrograd for several days and saw\r\nOlga and Tatiana at this presentation of Father’s at the Tauride\r\nPalace (Duma). He afterwards said to Olga: “Knowing your Imperial\r\nFather the way I do, I am most sorry for His Majesty; so is all the\r\nHigh Command, for there is not one single word of truth in all the\r\npropaganda circulating. He assuredly does not deserve such malicious\r\ncriticism.” Hanbury-Williams thought that Father’s address was most\r\nenthusiastically accepted and would bring good results. However, it\r\ncreated apprehension among the enemy who seemed to be losing hope of\r\nwinning the war. Nevertheless, it provoked more damaging propaganda.\r\nFather repeated that he would not yield to Germany. More than ever,\r\nWilhelm made Father his target. He aimed at him with traitors who\r\nspread their lies insidiously underground like the roots of a tree.\r\nThere were attacks on Father from all directions--a whispering\r\ncampaign spread to injure his reputation before his people. Of course\r\nMother already had come in for her share of this terrible barrage of\r\nfalsehood; in her case the slander centered around Anna and Rasputin.\r\nBut that only made Mother stubborn, and she closed her ears and no\r\nlonger would believe anyone around her. She had felt for a long time\r\nthat she was doomed to death from the day she set her foot on Russian\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX MOGILEV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1916, the date May 6th. It was Father’s forty-eighth birthday.\r\nThe day before, we went to G.H.Q. at Mogilev to be with him. As usual\r\nwe stayed on our train. On this occasion the Russian and all the Allied\r\nHigh Command, as well as some of our relatives, came to extend to\r\nFather their congratulations.\r\n\r\nMother, shy and reserved by nature, came with us even though she\r\ndreaded meeting the members of the Allied Military Missions, some of\r\nwhom she had not yet met. We knew many of the officers quite well.\r\nI particularly remember our friend General Keller, Generals Ivanov,\r\nLechitsky, Dieterichs, Yanin, Resin, Kornilov, Brussilov, Father’s\r\nChief of Staff, General Alexeiev, General Dubensky, the military\r\nhistorian attached to G.H.Q., and Captain Nilov. I recall, too, the\r\ntraitor, General Ruzsky, who left such a bad impression in the Baltic.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we went to the garrison church services nearby, under\r\nthe thick pine trees. There were many high ranking men and titled\r\nguests in attendance.\r\n\r\nMother had ordered flowers from the Crimea to be used as decorations\r\nfor the occasion. We sisters made two flower arrangements for Father’s\r\nstudy and his bedroom. One of these was placed on the table in his\r\nbedroom in front of an icon of Saint Nicholas. On the piano in the big\r\nhall were large branches of white orchids artistically arranged.\r\n\r\nDinner was served to about fifty guests. All the members of foreign\r\nmissions and the Russian generals and their wives who happened to be\r\nthere attended, as well as a number of the Grand Dukes who came to\r\nMogilev especially for this occasion.\r\n\r\nWe assembled in the large hall and stood in line with Father to receive\r\nthe congratulations of the guests. We girls wore white dresses and\r\nwhite hats trimmed with ostrich feathers. Uncle Serge Mikhailovich, who\r\nwas in command of the Russian artillery, was present. Others were the\r\nGrand Duke Cyril and his brother the Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich;\r\nthey could not disguise their bitter hatred for the family, especially\r\nfor Mother, when their turn came to take our hands.\r\n\r\nAt the dinner Mother sat next to Father and at her side was\r\nour handsome, lively brother Alexei. Opposite them was Olga,\r\nHanbury-Williams and the others. In the evening we took in a movie.\r\nPrince Igor Constantinovich was there and accompanied us next morning\r\non a walk in the forest, where spring flowers were abundant.\r\n\r\nFrom Mogilev we went to Sevastopol, Crimea, making several stops on the\r\nway to inspect military hospitals. At the Tsarskaya Pristan (dock) in\r\nSevastopol we were greeted with cheers by sailors from Navy vessels.\r\nEverywhere we went, we were met with a great deal of friendliness by\r\nthe people who came forth with flowers, fruits, and gifts of money for\r\nthe hospitals. We also made a surprise visit to the Romanov Institute\r\nof Physical Therapy. In Evpatoria we met Admiral Kolchak, who later\r\nplayed an important role in fighting the Communists in 1918 in order\r\nto capture Ekaterinburg and rescue us. Unfortunately he was betrayed\r\nby the Czech troops. We had tea with Anna, who had been sent there by\r\nMother on a special mission some weeks earlier. Father and Alexei went\r\nback to Mogilev and we left for Tsarskoe Selo. Anna accompanied us for\r\nseveral stations, and then returned to the Crimea.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the people began to show unrest as a result of a rumor,\r\nwhich an investigation showed had been spread by German agents, to the\r\neffect that Mother and Aunt Ella were hiding Uncle Ernest. It upset my\r\nMother so much that she had a heart attack.\r\n\r\nWhen demonstrations began to take place in Moscow, because of this\r\nfalse propaganda, Mother was told that Kerensky, who up to now was\r\nbiding his time, urged Guchkov to start a revolution, while the\r\nsituation was still hot. Mother said he should be hanged for it. While\r\nKerensky was plotting against my family, Father was at the front\r\nmaking every effort to bring Kaiser Wilhelm to his knees, despite\r\nthe offers for the separate treaty which were made by the Kaiser who\r\nstressed that an alliance with Germany would be more beneficial to\r\nRussia than one with England. But all the proposals were ignored.\r\nFather knew the German position in the war was the lack of physical\r\nstrength, particularly after Father’s Chamberlain, General Tatishchev\r\nhad interviewed German officer prisoners and was told by them that the\r\nKaiser had lost all his power which now rested in the hands of the High\r\nCommand.\r\n\r\nMother went to Mogilev again and this time she took Anna with her. It\r\ncaused a great deal of trouble and more hatred sprang from it. Even our\r\nown cousin, the Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, spread the most unjust\r\nlies: that some drink was given to Father by Anna and that he was under\r\nhypnosis. How shameful that this young man in return for love gave\r\ndisloyalty to the man who had given him kindness and affection as if he\r\nwere his own father. Another ridiculous rumor was that gold had been\r\nshipped over the border to Germany in the coffins in which supposedly\r\nwere bodies of German soldiers killed in the war.\r\n\r\nMother became resentful toward these rumors and stubborn in her\r\nreaction to them. Now she and Father would defend any innocent friend\r\nwho was brought under false suspicion or accusation. How could anyone\r\nbelieve such falsehoods, especially against my Father, which were found\r\nin the end not to be true. Madame Narishkina once said to us that\r\nMother’s friends brought her nothing but misfortune. It is true, but\r\nfor this misfortune many others also were responsible. Anybody could\r\nhave believed anything under the prevailing chaotic conditions of rumor\r\nand deceit For example, some years before the war, while the family was\r\nin the Crimea, every day a bouquet of fresh flowers was sent to Father\r\nfor his desk in his study, and the card in them bore the signature\r\n“Ania.” This naturally aroused great consternation. Upon investigation,\r\nit was found that Ania Vyrubova at that very time had been with her\r\nfamily in the small village of Terijoki on the Gulf of Finland and\r\nso could not possibly have sent the flowers. Later Princess Sonia\r\nOrbeliani, once Mother’s lady in waiting, a bitter enemy of Anna’s, in\r\na fit of anger revenged herself on Anna by saying that Anna had hired a\r\ngardener to send the flowers.\r\n\r\nAnother rumor related that Rasputin came to the palace by way of the\r\nback porch and visited the children’s quarters. In the first place,\r\nthere was no back porch. On one occasion, he did come upstairs to\r\nsee Alexei in his sickbed, using the private spiral stairway from\r\nMother’s apartments, but subsequently, whenever Rasputin came, Alexei\r\nwas carried downstairs. Moreover, Rasputin was accompanied by Father\r\nVassiliev and almost always the Emperor was present. Father had traced\r\nthis rumor to its source, and everyone connected with the story\r\nadmitted that they had not seen Rasputin enter the palace, but that\r\nthey were told to say so by a certain person. In fact, I never saw the\r\npeasant in any of our private quarters. These were always guarded at\r\nthe foot of each stairway. We were so surrounded with people that he\r\ncould not have avoided being detected by many.\r\n\r\nThis false rumor grew stronger and more outrageous stories were added\r\nto it. Those spreading these cruel gossips which injured Mother’s\r\nreputation were those who never had an opportunity even to see any\r\nmember of the Imperial family, people whose feet never had trodden the\r\ngrounds of Tsarskoe Selo. For every person living in this village was\r\nknown to the police and any stranger coming into the area was always\r\npicked up and investigated. Anyone entering there had to carry his\r\ncredentials. Those who spread such propaganda lived to regret it, but\r\ntheir remorse came much too late. Tragic as it was, these paid agents\r\nschemed to take Father away from the front because they knew his\r\npresence was all-important.\r\n\r\nAlexander Park was enclosed by an iron fence, which was topped with\r\nthree rows of barbed wire. Inside and outside were sentries at regular\r\nintervals. Every day these grounds were searched to be sure that no one\r\nwas hiding there. Not a single person could enter the palace without a\r\ngreat deal of red tape. There were four entrances to the palace. The\r\npeasant was not allowed to use the main gate. In retrospect, this was\r\nprobably a mistake as it gave an air of mystery to his rare visits.\r\nAccompanied by Father Vassiliev, he entered through the side or garden\r\ngate (across from the Znamensky Cathedral) which was accessible to only\r\na few. The procedure here was simpler but any such entry was recorded,\r\nas was the case at the main gate. These authentic official entries were\r\navailable since the time of Peter the Great, but many were destroyed by\r\nthe invading Communists.\r\n\r\nThe visitor had to present proper credentials as to whom he was to see\r\nand for what purpose. His name was written several times; also the\r\ntime of his arrival to the very minute. Halfway up the driveway to the\r\npalace the door of the car or the carriage was opened and the vehicle\r\nchecked; also again a note was made of the identity of the visitor. In\r\nthe meantime, the sentry at the gate had already telephoned the palace\r\nguard, announcing the arrival of the person. At the palace entrance,\r\nthe guard on duty opened a square, barred window, and the visitor was\r\nushered into a room where he presented his card to the officer on duty.\r\nThe latter checked and compared the name and description of the visitor\r\nwith names and photographs in a book, copies of which were found on\r\ntables in various parts of the palace. Then the visitor was directed to\r\nthe reception room, where Mother received him. This was the procedure\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\nAt each end of the corridor, and at the foot of every stairway, there\r\nwas always an officer on duty who kept a record to the minute of\r\neveryone going up and down the stairs, no matter how many times a day.\r\n\r\nUpon departure of a visitor, the same accuracy as to time was\r\nmaintained, and a record of his stay was handed to the palace police.\r\nThere were also a number of runners and about thirty-five guards\r\non duty in the corridors and stairways alone; not all were armed.\r\nThat same strict rule applied to all the palace staff, including the\r\nwell-known Mistress of the Robes, Madame Narishkina, and the ladies in\r\nwaiting. In fact when any one of us, even Father, arrived, the carriage\r\nwas always inspected. We were never left unattended and we did not know\r\nwhat privacy was, being always surrounded by our teachers, ladies in\r\nwaiting, governesses, nurses and chambermaids who frequently entered\r\nour rooms.\r\n\r\nSecret police continually checked every activity of everyone. It would\r\nhave been impossible to enter or leave in secrecy. No doubt there was\r\na file on Rasputin with a complete record of his visits to the minute,\r\nshowing how long he had been there and whom he had seen; and the names\r\nof the officers on duty had to appear in the record, especially after\r\nit was rumored that Rasputin was a spy. The secret police were watching\r\nhim; according to some it was only for his own protection. But, at\r\nthe same time, his activities were being carefully scrutinized. One\r\nslip on his part would have sent him to his death. The palace chief\r\nof police kept a copy of such records; another copy was delivered to\r\nthe chief of police in Petrograd. In fact, during our arrest, these\r\nrecords were checked on Rasputin and on every member of our family to\r\nthe very morning of our departure from the palace. The Ministers were\r\nresponsible for many troubles, because they gathered around Rasputin\r\nand that gave him more confidence.\r\n\r\nAs for Mother’s supposed pro-German leanings, how often I wished Kaiser\r\nWilhelm could have been in our household to hear the uncomplimentary\r\nremarks attached to his name. Alexei and I used to stuff pillows and\r\ntake shots with toy guns at Uncle Wilhelm. The name Wilhelm aroused\r\nsuch invectives we were ordered not to use the word.\r\n\r\nOlga Constantinovna, wife of King George I of Greece, sister of the\r\nGrand Duke Constantine Constantinovich, spoke to Mother about the\r\npeasant. She had become very upset about the gossip and because of it\r\nand the hot summer of 1916, she had suffered a heart attack. Later\r\nFather’s friend, Prince Volkonsky, came to see Father to warn him about\r\nthe peasant. At that time, Aunt Ella became so upset by these rumors\r\nthat she sent Count Sheremetiev, a friend and distant relative of ours,\r\nto deliver the message that Rasputin had been using our family name for\r\nhis personal advantage while under the influence of liquor in Moscow.\r\nMother and Father even now refused to believe the tale. It left Father\r\nvery distressed. He could not understand how this highly educated man\r\ncould have allowed anyone to recount such tales to him. This good\r\nfamily raised a great deal of money for hospitals; in their huge villa\r\nin Petrograd they sponsored a hospital for officers and paid for the\r\nupkeep from their own pockets. Besides, two of their sons were at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, Aunt Ella herself appeared at Tsarskoe Selo. First,\r\nshe talked to Mother alone about the peasant, but Mother said, “Sister,\r\nyou do not believe all that do you?” Ella said, “I do not, but the\r\npeople do.” Mother asked, “And who are those people? Please do not\r\nspeak, as the others do. There is not one word of truth in what your\r\nfriends are telling you.”\r\n\r\nMother was especially furious and could never forgive her sister when\r\nshe said that God might punish Mother by taking her son away from her.\r\nThat was a most painful remark for my Mother. The following morning,\r\nAunt Ella pleaded on her knees before my parents. Even then they\r\nrefused to believe the story. Instead Father turned to his aide-de-camp\r\nsaying, “Have a train ready for the Grand Duchess’ departure.” Father\r\nat once left for G.H.Q. very upset. When Aunt Ella entered the room\r\nwhere we had bid good-bye to Father, her eyes were wet with tears and\r\nshe was wiping them with her handkerchief. This was a sorrowful parting\r\nfor both sisters as well as for the whole family. We kissed her for\r\nthe last time, never to see her again. When she was leaving the rooms\r\nshe lifted a hand, saying, “Remember the fate of the other Empresses.”\r\nMother and both older sisters accompanied Aunt Ella to the station. We\r\nwere told that Aunt Ella knew then that Rasputin would be killed.\r\n\r\nMother often asked why people had not opened their eyes to see\r\nsomething else besides an inclination for harm, which springs from\r\nstupidity and ignorance. Why were they not able to judge us, and see\r\nthe good we had done? Even now she did not see that one could be\r\ncapable of falsehood. Mother had such a love for Russia that often\r\nshe said, “I would rather die than see Germany win the war!” She was\r\nEnglish in every way. She had spent most of her time with Granny (Queen\r\nVictoria), and from her earliest childhood had taken a dislike for her\r\ncousin Wilhelm, largely because of his lack of consideration toward\r\ntheir Granny.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Mother’s mail was more voluminous than ever. One\r\nof the letters she received called her attention to the illustrated\r\nmagazine _Niva_, in which was an article with a photograph of a dog\r\nundergoing vivisection. Among the magazines usually to be found\r\non the table in the room next to Mother’s room, I could not find\r\nthis issue. Because we were not allowed to remove books or magazine\r\nfrom the shelves, Mother immediately requested Mr. Shcheglov, our\r\nlibrarian, to bring this magazine to her. She asked me to find the\r\npage showing this needless cruelty. I opened the periodical; it fell\r\nopen at that page. Strapped to a table, the unfortunate animal was\r\nbeing operated on without anaesthesia. This horrifying picture made\r\nan enormous impression on us. Mother without wasting time took steps\r\nto prevent such laboratory work being done without the animals being\r\nanaesthetized.\r\n\r\nAt once she became unpopular with many technicians and medical men.\r\nWe all were always sympathetic towards animals, especially Alexei who\r\nfrequently took home many homeless animals; he fed them and never\r\nfeared being harmed by them. This good child repeatedly said, “Some\r\ntime I shall have a large place for all the animals who have no home. I\r\nwill feed them and care for them myself.” Many unfortunate animals were\r\nmade homeless by war. He brought dozens of cats and dogs and sent them\r\nto our farms. Proudly he once said, “I am positive there is not a mouse\r\nleft here.” The farmer agreed with him there was none.\r\n\r\nThere were always appeals to Mother for help. If a son was missing, she\r\nwas asked to help trace him. Any injustice which came to her attention\r\nshe tried to resolve by appealing to the proper authorities. When the\r\nburdens became too heavy, Mother rushed to the Church. To her, religion\r\nwas more than worship, it was life. She loved the rituals, candles,\r\nchanting and prayers. Through the unburdening of her heart, through\r\nsupplication for guidance, she was strengthened and helped to think\r\nmore clearly, to understand more deeply and accept God’s will with\r\ngreater humility. But dishonesty, insincerity, friction and perfidious\r\ngossip were continually clouding her sense of God’s will. At such a\r\ntime disunity was high treason to Church and State. She wanted a new\r\nregime so that Alexei would not have to struggle with the old autocracy\r\nhanded down by his Grandfather.\r\n\r\nFather had taken an oath in his war manifesto that he would never make\r\npeace so long as one enemy soldier remained on Russian soil. The enemy\r\nknew that only a revolution could defeat the Russian armies, so they\r\nspread a network of lies to poison the Russian mind. Their central\r\ntheme held that Mother was redoubling her pro-German activities. In the\r\nDuma attacks were made on Father in an effort to discredit him. Many\r\nfriends no longer participated at the meetings of the Duma; they could\r\nnot stand to hear the slander of their Emperor.\r\n\r\nThese words are painful for me to put in writing, and I shall not\r\nfurther denounce these slanderers, as it would be against my Christian\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\nWord was brought from General Headquarters that Alexei had caught cold\r\non the train during a trip to the front. He had sneezed and burst a\r\nblood vessel in his nose. When Dr. Fedorov was unable to stop the\r\nbleeding, also fearing that his cold might get worse, he suggested\r\nthat Father return Alexei to Tsarskoe Selo. He had almost died on his\r\nway home because of the jolting and jarring and it had been necessary\r\nto stop the train several times at night in order to change Alexei’s\r\ndressings. He collapsed into unconsciousness several times and seemed\r\nto be on the verge of death. All night Nagorny had to support his head.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in Tsarskoe Selo, we were receiving wires posting us on his\r\ncondition. Some arrived late in the evening so that Mother sat up\r\nall night, fearing that the end had come. At six in the morning Anna\r\ncalled Rasputin and requested him to pray for Alexei. Rasputin replied\r\nthat Alexei would be better, not to worry, and that the bleeding would\r\nstop. Strange as it may seem, the bleeding did stop shortly thereafter.\r\nLater we were told that Anna informed the peasant that Alexei was\r\nbetter. Mother went to the station to meet the train and when Alexei\r\nwas carried down the platform, he smiled at her. She was thankfully\r\nrelieved. His bleeding stopped. Mother kissed him and he drew her hand\r\nto his lips. Father left again for G.H.Q. and Alexei remained at home\r\nrecovering from his illness.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my brother’s poor health, our parents insisted that, as\r\nsoon as his condition improved and the weather permitted, he must\r\nreturn to Mogilev. It was felt necessary that he prepare himself for\r\nhis future responsibilities, even though his health had been impaired.\r\nFather said that Alexei was not to be shielded behind the scenes as\r\nhe himself had been during the reign of Alexander III. As soon as the\r\nwar should be over, Alexei, accompanied by his tutors, was to go to\r\nEngland to receive special training. My little brother became nervous\r\nunder the strain, and we all felt sorry for him. Once, at two o’clock\r\nin the morning, Alexei awakened Olga in her room and said, “I cannot\r\nsleep; I am worried.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that I had been asked to share the responsibility with Olga\r\nand Tatiana deeply stirred me. They suggested that Mother should not be\r\nleft alone in her bedroom at night while Father was away even though a\r\nmaid was in the room next to Mother’s. We sisters decided to take turns\r\nspending the nights with Mother, as well as time after school hours.\r\nAlexei was hurt, because he was not asked to share this loving trust.\r\nHe protested: “Am I not a member of the family? I am tired of taking\r\nhumiliations from you. You seem to enjoy giving me orders.” I explained\r\nthat he could do his share by sleeping in Father’s bedroom when he\r\nreturned to G.H.Q. This satisfied him.\r\n\r\nI shadowed Mother, amused her, and did everything in my power to make\r\nher happy. I did many things by which I hoped to spare her needless\r\nsteps. I accepted my responsibility seriously and was a little hurt at\r\nMother’s amused surprise at my obvious attentiveness. It pleased me to\r\nhave Mother call me her little helper, because I saved her many steps.\r\nOften Alexei called Mother on the telephone and, while she was talking\r\nto him, I would run up and warn him not to call Mother again. I felt\r\nresponsible for her and at the same time I was filled with a sense of\r\nimportance while on duty at her side. For some time we thought Mother’s\r\nhealth was deteriorating under the strain of worry and sorrow. Now her\r\nheart became worse and she no longer was able to give actual care to\r\nthe wounded at the hospital.\r\n\r\nWhile Father was home, he had several stories about Rasputin\r\ninvestigated. One report declared that Rasputin had boasted in a\r\nrestaurant, in public, that the embroidered upper blouse which he wore\r\nthat evening had been presented to him by the Empress. Father sent for\r\nthis man, whom he had disliked for so long. He questioned him about\r\nhis claim. The peasant appeared to be surprised and frightened, but had\r\nfinally admitted that he had made the remark. “How dare you?” Father\r\nlooked straight into his eyes. Then, Father pointed to the door and\r\nRasputin was shown out by an aide-de-camp. Olga remarked later to us\r\nsisters that the only regret she had was that the peasant had not been\r\nthrown out long before this.\r\n\r\nFather never liked nor believed in the Starets and neither did we\r\ngirls. Even Alexei was doubtful about the peasant’s honesty. In our\r\npresence, Rasputin was always respectful and unobtrusive. Mother,\r\nhowever, was convinced that Alexei’s life during his most severe\r\nattacks was saved by Rasputin’s prayers. Mother was impressed by the\r\nman’s simple common sense. He had such a saintly approach that Mother\r\nbelieved that he was a man sent by God. Most of the messages from\r\nRasputin had come to Mother through Anna. It was at Anna’s house that\r\nMother saw this wandering monk and their conversation was always about\r\nreligion. There was little doubt that he was a healer of a sort which\r\nsome Christian Churches have always known and recognized. However, many\r\ndiscounted Rasputin’s healing claims by explaining that he always came\r\ninto the picture when Alexei was already on the way to recovery. When\r\nAlexei was previously ill, because some one inserted into his lower\r\nbody some kind of serum which caused him untold suffering and many\r\nsleepless nights, Rasputin was blamed for it. It was Rasputin who made\r\nall the nurses and maids go to confess at the church as a result of\r\nwhich it was found that someone close to the family was responsible for\r\nthis illness.\r\n\r\nThe attacks Alexei suffered had become fewer and less serious. My\r\nparents were hopeful Alexei would eventually outgrow his trouble.\r\nAlexei was often puzzled about Rasputin, whom he considered to be a\r\nhealer. One day he asked, “Tell me, Mommy, why is it that God listens\r\nto the peasant’s prayers, but not to mine.” Mother honestly believed\r\nthat Rasputin was sent to save her son. Under similar circumstances\r\nany mother would have felt the same.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion we had Father Vassiliev as our guest. Alexei was\r\njust getting over a bad cold. He asked why people said that the peasant\r\nwas a saint. Papa replied that he would rather have Father Vassiliev\r\nexplain this to Alexei. The clergyman answered that anyone who does\r\ngood and lives according to the Holy Scriptures could be a saint. “Then\r\nwhat shall I do that God will listen to my prayers?” asked Alexei.\r\n\r\nFather Vassiliev of the Feodorovsky Sobor taught Alexei religion.\r\nAlexei was deeply attached to his instructor, who was very religious,\r\nhad a kind heart, loved people, made friends easily and was loyal and\r\ndefended them when they were in trouble. Alexei was bright, lively, had\r\na quick mind, delicate features, a white, clear complexion and coppery,\r\nauburn hair. In secret among the family he was called “Ruchka” (the\r\nhand). This he knew, although we did not at first know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI OUR LAST AUTUMN IN TSARSKOE SELO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of 1916 was a beautiful one, with the brilliant flames of\r\norange oak and russet beech trees, elms and avenues of lime trees all\r\nfused harmoniously as in a painting. It was our last autumn in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo. Again, Alexei joined his Father at G.H.Q. and both went to review\r\nthe troops at the front. As usual, Father inspected the field kitchens\r\nand tasted the food to be sure that it was kept up to the prescribed\r\nstandards. Then they visited the hospitals in Kiev, at the same time\r\nspending several days with Granny who had been living there in the\r\npalace near the beautiful Dnieper river for the duration of the war, in\r\norder to be near her daughter Olga.\r\n\r\nUpon their return to G.H.Q., Alexei sent a note home to say that\r\nFather was distressed after having had a talk with Granny; she had\r\nchanged. Alexei, although a child, was conscious of the fact that this\r\ndisquieting conversation stemmed from Ruchka’s illness and the peasant.\r\nGranny did not know that Alexei knew that in secret he was called\r\n“Ruchka”. There were other relatives present at this discussion, one of\r\nthem being Uncle Sandro (Alexander Mikhailovich). He was the head of\r\nmilitary aviation and was stationed in Kiev.\r\n\r\nDuring this conversation, Aunt Olga defended Alicky (Mother) whereas\r\nGranny blamed everything on her. Grandmother openly predicted then that\r\nall would end in disaster. Alexei promised Mother that he would never\r\ncause Father trouble, and would be careful of his own health. He told\r\nus later that he had cried on the train while Father was in his study,\r\nand that he no longer loved his Granny as he used to. At this time\r\nAunt Olga was happily remarried. Her husband was the handsome officer\r\nof the Guard whom she had known for a long time, Colonel Nicholai\r\nKoulikovsky.\r\n\r\nSoon Mother and we sisters went on another tour to the hospitals and\r\nwere greeted enthusiastically everywhere. We received big donations\r\nfor the hospitals. During this tour we stopped for a several days’\r\nvisit with Father. This was to be our last trip to G.H.Q. We knew right\r\naway that something connected with Rasputin was troubling Father, as a\r\nresult of his last visit to Kiev.\r\n\r\nNow Father asked Granny to leave for the Crimea in order to end the\r\ngossip, which without Granny’s encouragement would never have taken\r\nplace. Later even Olga wrote her asking for God’s sake to leave for the\r\nCrimea. But all was in vain.\r\n\r\nAt this time Uncle Sandro, the husband of Aunt Xenia, proposed to\r\nFather that he should promulgate the constitution on his name day,\r\nDecember 6th, but Father said it was impossible because at the\r\ncoronation he had sworn on the Bible to uphold the autocracy.\r\n\r\nNow we already knew of the plan to assassinate Mother, Father and many\r\nof his aides, especially Prince Dolgorukov, Captain Nilov, A.D.C.\r\nMordvinov, Count Fredericks and others. It was organized in Kiev by\r\nGuchkov. Granny and the Grand Duke Nicholai Nicholaevich in Caucasia\r\nsupported the idea, but Granny confessed to Father, during her last\r\nconversation with him, that she did not know that the Guchkov plan\r\nwas to assassinate Father and the others. She believed that they were\r\nworking towards Father’s abdicating the throne to the Grand Duke\r\nNicholai Nicholaevich.\r\n\r\nThe former Governor of Mogilev, Mr. Pelts, who let my Father use his\r\nresidence, and others also warned Father of the plot and told him that\r\nmany officers were approached by Guchkov to carry out the mass murder\r\nbut they all refused. The secret police were to close in on Guchkov\r\nbut Father wanted to have more proof. On this visit Granny wanted\r\nus children to come to Kiev, but we feared that the murder might be\r\ncommitted while we were away. After the abdication and before Father\r\nleft Mogilev, Granny came on her train to Mogilev. Even then she blamed\r\nthe abdication on Mother. Then Father asked her whether she knew of\r\nthe plan to assassinate him and Alicky, his wife. She cried that she\r\nhad not known of the plan to murder but had encouraged the abdication.\r\nWith these words they parted forever. No matter what, Father was\r\ncondemned from the day of Lenin’s brother’s execution during the reign\r\nof Alexander III, and also from the day of the execution of Trotsky’s\r\nbrother who was connected with one of the most dangerous revolutionary\r\norganizations during the Japanese war.\r\n\r\nFather occupied a section of one floor in the Governor’s home in\r\nMogilev. Built on a wooded hill, it enjoyed a magnificent view of\r\nthe broad Dnieper River. Father had two large rooms, one being the\r\nbedroom he shared with Alexei. In it, two iron beds stood side by side,\r\nseparated by a little table on which was a Bible and an icon. There\r\nwere also a mahogany dressing table, a wash stand, a settee, and a\r\nbookcase. The windows of this room faced the river on one side, the\r\ngarden and the parade grounds on the other. The adjoining room was\r\nFather’s office with windows facing the parade grounds. It held a large\r\nVictorian desk fully equipped, some photographs of the family, several\r\nbarometers and a floor lamp; also Alexei’s desk used for his school\r\nwork, a settee, and a bookcase. Next to the office was a large anteroom\r\nwith two big portraits of Father and Mother, plus a couch, a piano, and\r\nnumerous chairs. Next was a large, gloomy dining room. The entire suite\r\nhad parquet floors and fine carpets.\r\n\r\nSome of the upper and lower floors were occupied by Father’s staff:\r\nGeneral Voyeykov, Count Benckendorff, Prince Vasily Dolgorukov, A.D.C.\r\nNilov, Dr. Fedorov and Dr. Derevenko, now in charge of Alexei; Prince\r\nIgor Constantinovich often came here. With Father was also General\r\nDubensky, a friend of the Grand Duke Dimitri, Count Sheremetiev,\r\nA.D.C. Drenteln, and others. Father was accompanied by his rather\r\nnumerous military escorts and by his tall bodyguard Dendeniev, a\r\nCossack officer, who almost always was at his side. This officer could\r\nfire at the smallest flying object in the air without ever missing one\r\nshot. Also present was Father’s personal guard, Polupanov.\r\n\r\nIn Mogilev, we took some short trips, sometimes driving to the\r\nbeautiful Archayerevsky woods; or we walked in the deep snow, while\r\nAlexei played in the park with young cadets.\r\n\r\nAt some distance from the Governor’s home under the pine trees was the\r\nArmy field chapel. The General Staff office was within a short distance\r\nof the house. Due to the shortage of houses, all government buildings\r\nand some private residences were converted into living quarters for the\r\nmilitary staff and hospitals. In the winter Father had his luncheons\r\nin the dining room at the Governor’s house. The General Staff officers\r\nand officers on duty from the front were usually asked to join him\r\nat the noon meal. At these meals no military business was discussed.\r\nDiscussions of such matters took place every morning in the Supreme\r\nCommand office near by. Father disliked sitting at the table longer\r\nthan necessary and, as soon as the meal was over, he rose from the\r\ntable and his guests followed. During the summer, the luncheons were\r\nheld in a large tent on a hill in the pine woods.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when we were there, Father tried to be with us on our\r\ntrain. He poured the tea himself with only the family present. Father’s\r\ntrain stood on a sidetrack in the woods, his study was at the end and\r\ntwo strong Cossacks stood always on guard.\r\n\r\nOn one visit, we saw General Hanbury-Williams. He spoke to us about\r\nhis children, especially his two sons who were actively engaged in the\r\nwar. The General and Alexei became great friends. He and General Rickel\r\nboth spoke to Mother about the boy, saying that his presence made them\r\nforget about the war and that Mother should leave him in Mogilev. My\r\nbrother remained at G.H.Q. General Hanbury-Williams was often invited\r\nto dinner with Father and Alexei.\r\n\r\nWe left Mogilev. When we arrived at Tsarskoe Selo, we found one of\r\nMother’s ladies in waiting, Princess Sonia Orbeliani, critically ill.\r\nThis young friend of ours had suffered some years earlier a back injury\r\ncaused by a fall from her horse. Now the spine began to trouble her\r\nseriously. In the end she was totally paralyzed. We had a special nurse\r\nfor her, and she continued to stay in our house. Her room adjoined our\r\nrooms, and Mother went to see her every night to make sure that she was\r\ncomfortable. Having her in our home caused a great deal of jealousy\r\namong the other ladies in waiting and our staff. Sonia, herself, was\r\njealous of Anna Vyrubova, who in turn quarrelled with her. Poor Sonia\r\nwas still young when she left the world. Several times during her\r\nillness, before the war, we took her to the Crimea and we sisters\r\npushed her about in her wheel chair. Fortunately for her she passed\r\naway quietly before the fear of devastation settled over our family.\r\nFather returned home with Alexei just in time to attend Sonia’s funeral.\r\n\r\nFather was home for a few days only. He wanted to have a quiet evening\r\nwith just the family. Anna invited herself the very first evening. This\r\nupset Mother so much that she said exasperatedly, “I hope Anna can live\r\none day without seeing me!”\r\n\r\nWe sisters and brother left Mother’s room early, hoping that Anna\r\nwould do the same, but Mother told us the next morning that Anna had\r\ncontinued to stay until very late. Father told Olga that after the\r\nChristmas holidays, he would keep Alexei at G.H.Q. most of the time in\r\norder to avoid having Rasputin called in the event Alexei should become\r\nill.\r\n\r\nWhile home Father told us of a report that in one of the military\r\nhospitals a wounded soldier who had been decorated for his bravery\r\nwith the St. George Cross--one of the highest decorations in the\r\nRussian army--had asked for and received photographs autographed by\r\neach member of the Imperial family. After he was discharged from the\r\nhospital, in his bedside table drawer was found a German code. It was\r\nintended to use the pictures signed by us in propaganda leaflets which\r\nwere to be dropped in the Russian trenches. This soldier was identified\r\nand he confessed. There were important names involved in the plot. He\r\nwas executed, and his Latvian mother was placed under surveillance.\r\n\r\nMeantime Father investigated everything in the palace. To his great\r\ndismay and disappointment, he found disloyalty. German machine guns\r\nwere found hidden near Peterhof, and in the outskirts of our farms\r\nat Dudendorff near the Swiss chalet. No one knew how these were\r\nsmuggled in. Our own family was now being exposed to danger. The\r\npropaganda having failed at the front, it started to penetrate into\r\nhomes, schools, hospitals and elsewhere. One day a folder was found\r\non our library table. The headline said, “Germans are killing the\r\nRussian peasants, confiscating their cattle and taking everything for\r\nthemselves.” The article went on to say that Mother was a spy and was\r\ncollaborating with German agents. How this folder came to be placed on\r\nthe table remained a mystery. Mother’s real sorrow was that now Russia\r\nhad begun to believe these unfounded lies. At this time, King George\r\nof England wanted Mother to come to Sandringham for a rest, but she\r\nrefused to hear of it. “I shall rest when the war is over,” she said.\r\n\r\nFather also discovered that many peacetime guards had been removed from\r\nduty at the palace and sent to the front without his knowledge, leaving\r\nthe palace guard insufficiently manned. Father ordered additional\r\nguards to be sent from the mixed regiments but his orders were\r\ndisobeyed. Instead, revolutionists were assigned to guard the palace.\r\n\r\nThe last time we saw Granny was in Kiev some weeks before Christmas of\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nOur last trip to inspect hospitals was shortly before Christmas.\r\nAccompanying us was Anna Vyrubova. More and more we discovered\r\nhow much, under a superficial politeness, Anna was hated. She was\r\naware that her friendship with Mother caused Mother a great deal\r\nof suffering. It was at this time that we went to the old city of\r\nNovgorod. At the station we were met by the Governor with bread and\r\nsalt and his family presented us with flowers; greetings came from\r\na squadron of Mother’s own Uhlan Guards. Both sides of the streets\r\nwere lined with military men, school children, and civilians. With\r\ncheers and “ura” they threw their caps into the air, waved their\r\nhandkerchiefs, and pelted our limousines with flowers. At last we\r\nreached the cathedral where special carpets were stretched and the\r\nchurch was packed with well-wishers. Princes Igor Constantinovich and\r\nAndrei Alexandrovich came from nearby. At luncheon Igor remarked, “The\r\npeople most assuredly displayed great joy and devotion to you.”\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went to the hospital and Mother was touched by\r\nthe kind reception. It gave her courage and strength. To everybody’s\r\nsurprise she was able to walk to the second floor to see the sick\r\nmen. Here, too, we were given money to aid the wounded. At twilight,\r\nwith music, our automobiles were escorted to the station. We reached\r\nhome late that night. This trip gave Mother a lift and confidence and\r\nfor days she carried a smile of contentment, thanks to the people of\r\nNovgorod.\r\n\r\nThe Christmas of 1916 stands out brilliantly in contrast to the\r\nChristmas that followed. None of the secret joy was missing. Before\r\nthe war, when still quite young, we children used to be sent on a long\r\ndrive as the Christmas Eve dusk gathered. Oh, the thrill of watching\r\nthe daylight merge into night’s cocoon, knowing the excitement that\r\nwould come with darkness! At last the drive was over and we stood on\r\nthe very threshold of the mysterious room where Christmas Eve was to\r\nbe celebrated. From somewhere nearby Christmas carols were wafted\r\nup to us. As the door opened, there stood the glittering tree, each\r\nyear more beautiful than any before. The room was filled with people:\r\nfamily, friends, and the palace staff. From the highest to the most\r\nhumble servant, everyone gathered around the tree. Each was remembered\r\nwith a gift, no one was forgotten. For weeks my sisters, with the help\r\nof ladies of the court, had wrapped the presents, each looking like a\r\ngleaming jewel. The day before Christmas, most Russians take no food,\r\nonly water, until the first star appears in the heavens. This year, in\r\nthe early morning, we went to a service at the Feodorovsky Sobor, and\r\nat dawn the Christmas trees were lighted for us, the officers and the\r\nguard. We sisters had helped to decorate the trees.\r\n\r\nThe fast was followed by the Christmas Eve dinner of twelve courses,\r\nrepresenting the Twelve Apostles. No meat was served, but there were\r\nmany kinds of fish, each course having a symbolic meaning. There were\r\nhors d’oeuvre, soup, mushrooms, fruit and nuts, etc.\r\n\r\nWe decided to keep our own tree, set up on the second floor, until late\r\nafter the New Year. The flames of war and intrigue hissed and sizzled\r\nbut could not outshine the glow of Christmas. First of all there were\r\nplans for the hospitals and orphanages, great effort being put into the\r\npersonal cheer of each invalid and needy person. There were sparkling\r\ntrees decorated by Mother’s own hands, with white and silver ornaments.\r\nWith the hospitals full of wounded men and the tense condition at the\r\nfront, every one made a special effort to effect a semblance of gaiety.\r\nOn Christmas day, in the early afternoon, the tree was lighted for\r\nthe Guard, the regimental orchestra played, and the Cossacks danced\r\nand sang. Everyone stood around the tree and Olga, acting for Mother,\r\npresented the gifts. Our gifts were usually simple and useful.\r\n\r\nAlthough that Christmas had the familiar setting, it did not have the\r\ncustomary joyous spirit. First of all, Father’s duties claimed his\r\ntime with heavy responsibilities. I remember that the day before his\r\ndeparture for Mogilev, he was discouraged and upset. He had a long talk\r\nwith Olga in his study before he left. Asking her to persuade Mother in\r\nsome way that she should not write him daily long letters, he relied\r\non the help of our oldest sister. For these letters, telling Father\r\nwhat should be done, were resented by him. He was especially annoyed\r\nwhen Anna sent along her own naive suggestions; these he called stupid.\r\n“Everyone is issuing orders and I have to listen to them,” he said. He\r\nalso asked Mother not to talk with her friends regarding matters they\r\nknew nothing about. That, he pointed out, was the Ministers’ business\r\nand no one else’s. Father himself had asked Mother not to do this.\r\nHe was tired and worried about the things she mentioned, long before\r\nshe was aware of the fact that Father’s replies to her were short and\r\nconcise. Mother felt surprise that he made no comment on what she had\r\nwritten. Then she decided to go and see Father in Mogilev.\r\n\r\nMother was a great thinker and a reader of scientific books, natural\r\nscience, religion and astronomy. She could solve the hardest\r\nmathematical problems. She spent many hours in her small library next\r\nto her sitting room, reading her rare books on Indian philosophy,\r\ngiven her by the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nicholaevna, the divorced\r\nwife of the Duke of Leuchtenberg and later the wife of the Grand Duke\r\nNicholai Nicholaevich, who himself was also a scholar of Persian and\r\nIndian history. Mother never wasted one minute. Everyday she spent many\r\nhours with her secretary on reports. Her mail was enormous. She wrote\r\nbeautifully and her letters were sad and touching. She cared little\r\nfor wealth. She left behind in Tsarskoe Selo and Petrograd, Livadia,\r\nand Alexandria items of immense value--her platinum, rock crystal desk\r\nset, and a gold one; her dressing table accessories; her collection of\r\ncrosses and boxes; the dozen genuine blue sapphire, gold-rimmed glasses\r\n(the work of Bolin) given her one at a time over a period of years by\r\nFather; valuable laces; and over 300 Easter eggs. She took with her\r\nonly a few keepsakes; many of the most valuable items were left in\r\nTsarskoe Selo in the care of Count Benckendorff.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the holiday week there came a great change. On December\r\n30th, 1916, Olga came to us excitedly and whispered: “Rasputin is\r\nmissing!” His daughter had just telephoned Anna that he had not been\r\nhome all night. This had alarmed Anna who had seen Rasputin just the\r\nprevious evening, in Petrograd--for a few minutes only, in order to\r\navoid further talk. Anna remembered that Rasputin had told her then\r\nthat Prince Felix Youssoupoff was to call for him late in the evening\r\nto take him to his home to meet his wife, Irina. Mother was sure that\r\nour pretty cousin, Princess Irina, was in the Crimea and ill at that\r\ntime. Irina was the daughter of Father’s sister, Xenia, and the Grand\r\nDuke Alexander Mikhailovich, the grandson of the Emperor Nicholas I,\r\nand Father’s favorite cousin and his brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nOlga and Tatiana left to attend to their work in the hospital as\r\nusual, while Marie and I reluctantly went to the schoolroom. After\r\nclasses we joined the family and found, to our horror, that suspicion\r\nof Rasputin’s disappearance pointed not only to Prince Youssoupoff but\r\nto our own cousin, the Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich. After a thorough\r\ninvestigation by the police, it was established that Rasputin had been\r\nmurdered, his body wrapped in a military blanket and thrown into the\r\nNeva river in Petrograd.\r\n\r\nThe frozen corpse was found two days later, under the ice. It was\r\nassumed that the body had been carried in a Red Cross car, then thrown\r\ninto the river from the bridge. Inasmuch as a Red Cross conveyance\r\nhad been involved, it came as a sickening shock to learn that the\r\nmurder was linked to these two young men with the knowledge of the\r\nCommander of the Red Cross, Purishkevich, who was a member of the Duma.\r\nSeveral previous unsuccessful attempts on Rasputin’s life had been\r\nmade. Once he was stabbed by a young woman in Siberia and another time\r\ndeliberately run over by a carriage. Each time he had escaped serious\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nIt was especially shocking to find Dimitri Pavlovich involved for,\r\never since he had been a young man, he had had a room in our home in\r\nTsarskoe Selo and in the Crimea. His sister, Marie, had also spent many\r\nhappy days with us. Aunt Ella had brought him up as her own son after\r\nhis widowed father married a second time and left Russia for a while.\r\nDimitri was considered a member of our family and we all were extremely\r\nfond of him. It was almost impossible for us to believe that he could\r\nbe implicated in the murder of this much despised man. Later we heard\r\nthat his role in the affair was very minor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the news came that General Hanbury-Williams’ son had gone\r\ndown with Lord Kitchener on the torpedoed “Hampshire” in the North\r\nSea. It was such a blow to our family that we all cried on hearing the\r\ntragic news. Mother sent some orchids to the General with our profound\r\nsympathy. Later, Alexei told us that, when the General appeared that\r\nevening for dinner, and when they greeted each other, the General threw\r\nhis arms around Alexei in tears. Alexei said: “My heart went out to\r\nhim.” After dinner, they kissed each other, the General calling Alexei\r\nthe most loving child as he departed for his quarters. The next day\r\nGeneral Hanbury-Williams once more joined Father and Alexei at dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Father had received a telegram announcing that\r\nRasputin had been killed. Father and Alexei left for Tsarskoe Selo,\r\nand Alexei never saw the General again. Painfully Alexei described to\r\nus the last evening he had with the General. Alexei, sympathetic and\r\nsensitive, suffered with him and felt he, himself, should return to\r\nG.H.Q. as the unfortunate General needed someone to comfort him. The\r\nGeneral later sustained another sad blow, upon learning that his second\r\nson had been wounded. We all felt his tragedies as though they were our\r\npersonal loss.\r\n\r\nFather posed for a moment only for a family picture beside the tree.\r\nThen he read the report of the Rasputin murder. His reaction was: “To\r\nthink that a member of the Imperial family could commit such a crime as\r\nto kill the Starets. I am ashamed to face the peasants who are fighting\r\nvaliantly for Russia, and many of whom have died. And yet these boys\r\nfind time for murder, as though there is not enough crime in the world.”\r\n\r\nThose who committed the murder should have been at the front. How\r\nunjust to kill a man without a trial and without an opportunity to\r\ndefend himself. It may be these young men imagined themselves to be\r\npatriots in killing one who had repeatedly prophesied future reverses\r\nfor the Empire. If this despised man was undermining the foundation\r\nof Russia by promoting a dishonorable peace with the enemy, then he\r\ndeserved even a greater punishment. But there was no proof. Father did\r\nnot come home because Rasputin was killed but because our two relatives\r\nwere involved in the crime, and the punishment had to come from him\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nBecause of Rasputin’s death, a great rejoicing had swept over\r\nPetrograd. There were telegrams of congratulation for the illustrious\r\ndeed, toasts with the touching of glasses filled with champagne. No one\r\ncould foresee that these toasts, with glasses “bottoms up”, were for\r\ntheir own funeral.\r\n\r\nFather struggled with the problem of how to punish the young men. He\r\nordered Felix to be exiled to one of his estates in the province of\r\nKursk. It was during my escape in 1918, when I set foot there, that the\r\nwhole picture seemed to come into focus before me: Mother, Dimitri,\r\nFelix. It must have been a great shock to the quiet, beautiful, young\r\nwife, Irina, who was deeply in love with her husband, Felix. Most of\r\nthe people thought of this Oxford graduate as a fascinating handsome\r\nman, having a great deal of humor, one who could never do such a\r\nterrible thing. But he believed that this was the solution to save\r\nRussia. Dimitri was sent to the General Staff on the Persian border,\r\nwhere the Grand Duke Nicholai Nicholaevich was. Luckily Dimitri escaped\r\nthe fate of his father, his half-brother, his cousins, and other\r\nrelatives who were killed in 1918-1919. Immediately, his relatives\r\ntried to intercede, as had been done at the time of the coronation\r\ndisaster, which it was claimed, was the result of the negligence of the\r\nGrand Duke Serge Alexandrovich.\r\n\r\nIt was a blow to Father himself, since we all were so fond of Dimitri.\r\nBesides he was Father’s ward and like a brother to us. On account\r\nof Dimitri’s poor health, after having spent several months at the\r\nfront early in the war, he was sent back to Petrograd and, since then,\r\nhe had spent his time there without occupation and so had become\r\ninvolved in this crime. His own father, the Grand Duke Paul, expressed\r\ndissatisfaction. Even though the punishment was light, still the\r\nrelatives resented it and expressed coolness towards us. The Grand Duke\r\nAlexander Mikhailovich, Father’s brother-in-law, came to see Father but\r\nto no avail. Father said forcefully: “No matter whether it was a Grand\r\nDuke or a peasant, the law is the same for all.”\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole Romanov family, led by the Grand Duke Cyril, his\r\nmother, Marie Pavlovna, and his brothers, Andrew and Boris, signed a\r\npetition in which they asked for the release of the two young heroes.\r\nMy father was so angered by this, he said: “They would never have dared\r\nask such a favor from my austere father, Alexander III” and “No one has\r\nthe right to commit a murder, especially in time of war and within my\r\nrealm.”\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna (née Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin)\r\nbeing successful in turning almost all the relatives, as well as many\r\ninfluential friends, against my family hoped by this division of the\r\nfamily to bring the crown to her son. She invited to her parties some\r\nmutual friends and continued her slander against my family. Among these\r\ncourted guests was Rodzianko, President of the Duma. Some of these\r\ncould no longer tolerate her scheming and, to her amazement, they asked\r\nto be excused and left in the midst of the conversation. The most\r\ndamaging effect, due to this division of the Imperial family, was the\r\nplot organized by the Grand Duke Cyril to kill Mother and Father. The\r\nplanning had taken place at the Imperial Yacht Club in Petrograd, of\r\nwhich my Father and all the relatives were members. Many friends also\r\nbelonged to it.\r\n\r\nThey were given a warning to discontinue making trouble while other men\r\nwere dying in the trenches. Father gave orders to separate them, and\r\nthey were to go to their various estates. This blow was more than they\r\ncould bear. No matter what the cost, they were determined to uproot\r\nthis man who was a thorn in their side.\r\n\r\nAfter the sad parting of the two sisters in Tsarskoe Selo, Aunt Ella’s\r\nbitterness toward my Mother increased. I was told that she knew then\r\nthat there was to be an attempt on the life of Rasputin, yet she did\r\nnot discourage Dimitri from taking part in it; instead, she spent\r\nher time in a convent where she met one of her friends, and prayed\r\non her knees in this convent while the murder in Petrograd was being\r\ncommitted. I wonder now whether she was praying for her own soul. To my\r\nsorrow her life also ended very painfully in 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nMother once thought that, if Alexei could not be spared, Dimitri might\r\nmarry one of her daughters in order to carry on the Romanov line. Now\r\nshe had to take Rasputin’s death philosophically. At the same time,\r\nshe grieved over the mistake of the young men, especially the one\r\nwhom she had loved as her own son. Unfortunately, the Emperor Paul\r\n(1796-1801) had decreed that no female be allowed to succeed to the\r\nRussian throne. I think that, in case of political turmoil, the decree\r\ncould have been set aside. Olga would have made a wonderful Empress.\r\nShe was intelligent, well-read, had a kind disposition, was popular\r\namong her friends, and understood human nature. She was a true Russian\r\nin heart and soul. She could not have been easily deceived. I am sure\r\nthat she would have ruled wisely in the interest of her people. Father\r\nhad inherited from his father, Alexander III, the autocratic form of\r\ngovernment which contributed in part to the downfall of Russia.\r\n\r\nFather stayed on but we hardly saw him, except at mealtime. He left\r\nthe table hurriedly and buried himself in state papers and military\r\nproblems. It was a great comfort, nevertheless, to have him with us.\r\n\r\nThe Germans reasoned that Rasputin’s death would remove one of the most\r\nfruitful subjects of their propaganda. Consequently they hastened to\r\npush forward another subject. German agents dropped leaflets into the\r\nRussian trenches stating that the Tsar was about to sign a separate\r\npeace treaty with Germany. It was also said that Mother, while she\r\nvisited Father in Mogilev, had entertained Generals Ludendorff and\r\nHindenburg at night and received letters from her brother, Uncle\r\nErnest. Another rumor had it that the Russian officers of the General\r\nStaff and the Grand Dukes were gambling and wasting their time in\r\ncabarets while Russian soldiers were dying in the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic army was not taken in by this propaganda, because\r\nthey had seen Father’s devotion to the cause of Russia. But General\r\nLudendorff and the Kaiser intensified this propaganda because they\r\nknew it was impossible to defeat the brave Russian army without the\r\nconnivance of a revolution behind the lines. The idea was to divide,\r\nconquer, poison the mind of the Russian people and weaken loyalty to\r\nthe Emperor. Mutiny was feared at the front since Father was away in\r\nTsarskoe Selo, not because our troops were inadequately fed, clothed\r\nand supplied with arms. On the contrary the troops, Father said, were\r\nnever so strong and well-fed, and our military strength was now greater\r\nthan at the beginning of the war. But the supplies were deliberately\r\ndelayed by the merchants who received bribes from German agents\r\nwhile Father was away. So the goods were withheld from the markets\r\nby the merchants. Ten million rubles were spent to overthrow Russia\r\nby revolution. It was this money that originally had been intended\r\nto be used to improve the conditions of the Russian prisoners of war\r\nin Germany. Father’s presence was needed at General Headquarters. In\r\nspite of Alexei’s symptoms of measles and the fever that raged in him,\r\nFather left for G.H.Q., promising to return soon. For Mother, always\r\napprehensive of Alexei, had begged Father to stay home a few days until\r\nthe boy’s condition could be better determined. But Father’s plans had\r\nbeen made some months ahead for a surprise attack on the enemy and\r\ncould not be changed.\r\n\r\nFather had hardly departed before riots and strikes became a common\r\noccurrence in Petrograd. Shortages were reported; there was plenty of\r\nbread, even though it was not available in the stores. However, many\r\nmerchants--some were foreigners and some were not--hid the products\r\nor raised the prices so high that the poor could not purchase any\r\nmeat, butter, or other essential commodities. Train loads of grain\r\nstood on the tracks until the grain became mouldy and unfit for human\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nOne morning Mother entered her room to find Father’s picture lying\r\non the floor. The glass covering this picture, taken recently at\r\nthe trenches, was broken at the position of Father’s neck in the\r\nphotograph. Immediately Mother’s superstitious nature reappeared. There\r\nwas, she felt, something wrong with Father. This breakage could have\r\nbeen the work of a hostile servant but, more likely, the wind had done\r\nit. To Mother it was a bad omen. Again her anxious mind went back to\r\nthe large cross she saw in the sky as they crossed the Troitsky bridge\r\na few years before. Did these signs indicate that Father was to bear a\r\nheavy cross in the future?\r\n\r\nThen she had a dream which increased her anxiety. In it she saw the\r\nGrand Duke Serge, who had been blamed for the coronation disaster and\r\nhad been dead for years, come to visit us; suddenly he began to dance\r\nand wave a chiffon veil. Father sat and watched him. All at once the\r\nGrand Duke came to the end of his little dance, and the veil he was\r\nwaving caught on the stone on top of the crown on Father’s head. A\r\nquick move of the Grand Duke and the crown was off Father’s head and\r\ndashed to the floor. Seven of the large stones seemed to disappear,\r\nonly one being left. Soon that, too, began to evaporate slowly until\r\nit became a tiny pebble and finally vanished. The dream haunted her.\r\nDid it mean that the crown would be lost? The little stone that\r\nvanished--did that indicate that Alexei might be taken away from us?\r\n\r\nAnother bad omen! The chain which held the cross and the ruby ring\r\n(actually it was a red diamond) which Father had given to Mother and\r\nwhich she lately had been wearing around her neck, had broken. These\r\nshe had always considered her good luck charms. She often placed her\r\nruby ring on the chain with the cross and now, when the chain broke,\r\nthe ring rolled one way and the cross another. Did this have a meaning\r\nin relation to Father’s safety or did it indicate a rift between\r\nFather and the Church? Later this same ring was taken from Mother by\r\nVoykov several weeks before the tragic night at Ekaterinburg; he wore\r\nthis red diamond on his little finger. Mother and I, myself, were great\r\nbelievers in dreams; I still believe in mysticism.\r\n\r\nMother had not heard of Father’s safe arrival at G.H.Q. Finally\r\nwe received the news that he had reached his destination. Serious\r\ndisorders in the streets of Petrograd began two days later and lasted\r\nfor about ten days. While the air was thick with suspicion, strikes,\r\nriots, and accusations, we children were seized with measles. Alexei\r\nhad been ill before Father left; next Olga was stricken; then Tatiana;\r\nand, at last, I caught the disease. Marie helped Mother to care for\r\nus, but not for long because she, too, fell ill. Then both she and I\r\ncontracted pneumonia and had to be placed in oxygen tents.\r\n\r\nEarly in March, we heard through General von Grooten, assistant to\r\nGeneral Voyeykov, Commandant of the Palaces, and at that time with\r\nFather at G.H.Q., of the conversation he had had with the military\r\ncommandant in Petrograd, General Belyayev. He had, himself, been able,\r\nthrough General Voyeykov, to speak to Father and tell him of the true\r\nstate of affairs. Rodzianko had wired His Majesty that everything was\r\nquiet. The General had acted on his own initiative because he could see\r\nthe critical conditions in Petrograd and in Tsarskoe Selo. Father was\r\nrelieved to hear that we were alive. Through General Belyayev, Father\r\nsent word that we should do nothing until he returned home. But we must\r\nbe ready to go away at a moment’s notice. He had also been informed\r\nthat we all were ill, but he hoped that, when he arrived home, we would\r\nbe well enough to leave. He did not know that Marie and I and several\r\nothers at the palace had pneumonia.\r\n\r\nAt this time Rodzianko called the palace to say that Father was well\r\nbut we were in great danger and should go at once to Gatchina Palace,\r\nabout thirty miles southwest of Petrograd. Uncle Michael also had his\r\nresidence there, and many other relatives of the Imperial family\r\nmaintained villas in the park. Had we gone there, we would have had\r\nmore freedom. Two parallel wings, connected by a third, were almost\r\ncompletely enclosed. Each wing had more than several hundred rooms, and\r\nthe grounds held a fair-sized lake in the middle. The estate included\r\nthousands of acres of gardens, forest and ravines. We might more easily\r\nhave escaped from there abroad.\r\n\r\nThere were rumors that Uncle Ernest was hiding in a tunnel. People\r\nprobably confused a tunnel at Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo with a\r\nnatural passage at Gatchina. This natural passage could be entered from\r\nthe stairway of the palace into a dark narrow hall, the exit of which\r\nled to the bank of Silver Lake adjoining the Baltic Sea. This spooky\r\ntunnel was cold, damp, and had a mournful echo. All these gruesome\r\nthings came to my mind. I could see the statue of Paul I in front of\r\nthe palace. His clothes, which were brought into his room after his\r\nassassination, remained there undisturbed as on the day he left the\r\npalace. There was a belief that Paul’s ghost walked at night about the\r\nvast rooms, corridors, and terraces. Others even claimed that they had\r\nheard him calling in the tunnel, and some servants were afraid to leave\r\ntheir rooms when the clock struck twelve midnight. This palace was my\r\nGrandfather’s favorite residence.\r\n\r\nIn Tsarskoe Selo there was a tunnel or passage through one of the park\r\nentrances. This entrance, with a stone structure over the gate, was\r\ncarefully watched, and was used by the workers--delivery men, repair\r\nmen, cooks, maids, gardeners and others. No one could enter this\r\npassage without showing his or her pass and the picture on the pass had\r\nto correspond with the one in the book which was at the disposal of the\r\nguard. When these workers reached the inner end of the tunnel, they\r\nwere in the English basement of the palace where there were a number of\r\nrooms set aside for their use. These included a lounge, dining rooms,\r\netc. In another section of the basement were rooms for the officers,\r\nincluding a dining room which was below Mother’s bedroom. Five or six\r\nhundred workers used this tunnel daily. It was one of the busiest\r\nand most widely used entrances. Practically all these people using\r\nthis gate had been known to the guards, inasmuch as they had used this\r\nentrance for many years.\r\n\r\nWe heard that the soldiers were breaking into stores, getting drunk,\r\nand even becoming intoxicated on wood alcohol. As a result, some were\r\npoisoned and died. These deaths were blamed on the palace guard.\r\n\r\nMother was on duty with us children all night for several nights.\r\nAlthough she made frequent changes, she appeared constantly in her\r\nnurse’s uniforms. She rested on the sofa in order to be near us.\r\nThe trials my Mother endured during these turbulent days are beyond\r\ndescription. One of the first things Mother did as a prisoner was to go\r\nthrough her personal letters. She burned some of the intimate ones she\r\nhad received from Father during their courtship. Other letters which\r\nshe destroyed were those from her Granny, Queen Victoria. When Mother\r\nwas a young bride, expecting her first child, her Granny gave her\r\nuseful advice. All letters written by the Imperial family were almost\r\nalways numbered and dated so that it was easy to know whether any were\r\nmissing. When the palace was searched by the commissars appointed\r\nby the Provisional Government, they noticed the paper ashes in the\r\nfireplace. They accused Mother of having burned important evidence. She\r\ncould not change their suspicion that she had burned more than personal\r\nletters of sentiment. When she was through burning them, she said; “All\r\nis dead--but not my memories. No one can take them from me.” Then she\r\nburied her face in her hands, resting her arms on the mantel of the\r\nfireplace where she had burned her Granny’s own handwritten, cherished\r\nletters. She wept bitterly over the flame that carried Queen Victoria’s\r\nprecious words into smoke.\r\n\r\nThe authorities now read all the remaining letters of my Father and my\r\nMother. When they were unable to find anything detrimental with which\r\nthey could accuse them, they fabricated all kinds of lies in order to\r\ndeceive the general public. They even forged Mother’s handwriting\r\nand signature and published all sorts of atrocious lies against my\r\nparents. Several of those “letters” we saw later in Ekaterinburg;\r\nthe handwriting was very much like Mother’s. Mother was accused of\r\npro-German sympathies and actually of being a spy. What would it have\r\nmattered to the traitors if Mother had been a spy? But she was not.\r\nIt was purposely done with a view to putting the blame on someone who\r\nwould have produced the most damaging results to the country. It was\r\nall a part of the traitors’ pattern of intrigue to wreck the country\r\nand to weaken the Russian government, if necessary by revolution.\r\n\r\nAll these accusations were a betrayal and deceit. They sprang from\r\nthe rumor that Mother, with the help of her brother, was seeking a\r\nseparate peace with Germany. Mother was falsely accused, had absolutely\r\nnothing to do with it. It was caused by the actions of Princess Maria\r\nVasilchikova, of whom I have written before, who also knew Uncle\r\nErnest. She came from a Russian family who were also friends of Aunt\r\nElla. She had known Mother for some ten years. She was a friend of\r\nthe Imperial families of Austria and Germany, and, just before the\r\noutbreak of war in 1914, she was in Austria. Sometime in 1916, she had\r\nbeen persuaded by the Austrian and German Governments to write letters\r\nto Mother in which she stressed that both Governments had always been\r\nfriendly with Russia, that they wished to renew this friendship, but\r\nthat they did not put much faith in the alliance with England. Three or\r\nfour such letters came to my family. These letters were known to all\r\nthe High Command, the secret police and to the Minister of War. Father\r\ndid not answer them. Both Governments, he said, should have known\r\nbetter. Instead, they waged war rather than take Serbia to the tribunal\r\nat the Hague.\r\n\r\nFather was angered when he heard that Maria had been to see the Russian\r\nprisoners of war in Germany, expecting that they would put pressure\r\non Father to agree to a truce. He had received information that these\r\nprisoners were well cared for, but the subsequent report from the\r\nRed Cross proved that was not true. In one of her letters Maria\r\nstated that, if the treaty were not considered, all Russia would be\r\nendangered. Evidently Maria well knew the aim of the enemy: fostering\r\nrevolution. She also went to see Uncle Ernest, and subsequently a\r\nletter came from her and Uncle Ernest, addressed to Mother, sent by way\r\nof Sweden.\r\n\r\nMother was very angry and terribly upset about Maria and Uncle Ernest,\r\nparticularly that he would even think that Father might conclude such\r\na treaty. She said that she never wanted to see her brother again. She\r\nanswered this letter herself and emphasized that no separate peace\r\ntreaty would be signed with Germany. Because Mother sent this letter\r\nwithout Father’s consent, he was greatly upset.\r\n\r\nThen a letter from Wilhelm II came to Count Benckendorff asking him to\r\nencourage Father to sign a separate treaty. Father said, let him write\r\nsuch letters to all my Allies, but a separate German treaty with Russia\r\nonly, will never take place.\r\n\r\nStill later a letter came from Petrograd from that same Maria,\r\nenclosing a note from Uncle Ernest. She begged for an audience with my\r\nMother, who refused to grant her request but, instead, referred Maria’s\r\nletter to the proper authorities. Her appearance in Petrograd stirred\r\nup considerable trouble because it made people believe that she had\r\nbeen to see Mother. Then she wrote to Aunt Ella and, when Aunt Ella did\r\nnot answer, she went to see Minister Sazonov. He, too, angrily said:\r\n“There will be no separate peace with Germany.” All the letters were\r\nturned over to the secret police who were especially furious at her\r\nsaying that her estate in Austria would be confiscated. At this, Mother\r\nremarked: “Why should Russia be held responsible because Maria’s estate\r\nwill be confiscated?” Father ordered that Maria be sent to her sister’s\r\nestate. Father was very angry, saying “Wilhelm must be mad.” How could\r\nanyone forget the actions of the German and Austrian Emperors which\r\nbrought on the war and resulted in the loss of thousands of Russian\r\nlives, widespread suffering and enormous destruction of property,\r\nespecially in the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nHow absurd for anyone to think that Mother would spy for Germany. For\r\nshe had waited so long for a son to fulfill the need of the country\r\nwhen Father’s time was to come. How could she betray anyone she loved\r\ndearly, her husband, her son, or her adopted Mother Country! Anyone\r\nbelieving such illogical and unintelligent propaganda was not a healthy\r\nthinker.\r\n\r\nOne day the commissars, in searching the palace again, discovered a\r\nsecret panel cupboard. No one knew how they discovered the secret door\r\nas it was so well concealed in the wall. This secret closet contained\r\na number of Mother’s treasures of various kinds. There was a keepsake\r\nof no value, an accordion-pleated fan which had upon it pictures of\r\nMother and Father when they were young. It had been presented to them\r\non one of their visits to France. From one angle, when you looked at\r\nit, there appeared a picture of Mother; from another angle, it showed a\r\npicture of Father. At this time, some others of Mother’s keepsakes were\r\nremoved. One, especially beautiful, was a fan with a tortoise shell\r\nhandle, jewelled with emeralds; the pleated lace was studded with tiny,\r\ndouble eagle, gold sequins. There were many other items of great value.\r\n\r\nAs we lay in our darkened rooms trying to recuperate, we kept asking\r\nwhy Father did not come. Five invalids at once! When Madame Lili Dehn,\r\nthe wife of Charles Dehn, the captain on our yacht and a friend since\r\nour childhood, received the news of our illness, she left her little\r\nboy with a nurse and rushed to help us, but the day of her arrival she\r\nbecame a prisoner in the palace with the others. She brought us the\r\nnews that shops had been plundered, and that serious clashes had arisen\r\nbetween rebels and police. Dr. Derevenko brought news that the Liteiny\r\nArsenal in Petrograd was in the hands of the rebels, that explosions in\r\nfactories were taking place and that soldiers had been deserting their\r\nposts in panic.\r\n\r\nPrincess Obolensky, Olga Butsova and Princess Dundakova, once ladies\r\nin waiting, and the brother of Captain Charles Dehn likewise offered\r\ntheir assistance, but were denied entry to the palace. Mother had\r\nso wished that they could be with us, because they had always been\r\nfaithful to us. Countess Anastasia (Nastinka) Hendrikova, a lady in\r\nwaiting, heard of our illness and she left the Caucasus and came to\r\nTsarskoe Selo to offer her assistance.\r\n\r\nTo Mother’s distress she found that many of her servants had contracted\r\nthe flu as the epidemic swept the palace and some had run away in fear,\r\nincluding Derevenko, the sailor, Alexei’s servant. He told the other\r\nemployees that he might prefer to serve the new regime; he was finally\r\narrested by order of the Provisional Government, which had found stolen\r\nproperty on him.\r\n\r\nWe could hear the clashing of the mutineers, the screams and the shouts\r\nand some shooting near the palace gate. Mother was shocked to find\r\nthere were so few soldiers on duty. She hurried to the phone to speak\r\nwith the officer at the main gate, but there was no answer. She phoned\r\nthe other entrance and the officer on duty informed her that many\r\nguards had deserted their posts, only a few being left to guard the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nA cannon was brought into the courtyard in readiness, but Mother begged\r\nthe guards not to fire even one single bullet into the crowds. No\r\nmatter what the consequences, she wished no blood shed on account of\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nMother heard noises in the officers’ room below her bedroom. She\r\nwent down personally with Marie. She requested one of the officers\r\nto accompany her to the section where the guards came in to warm\r\nthemselves. Mother ordered that hot tea should be served to them as\r\noften as they came in, because the temperature had dropped to 18° below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin was announced and when he entered our rooms he looked pale\r\nand distressed. He told Mother of a rumor that Father had been shot.\r\nBut Mother refused to believe this. With the world collapsing around\r\nher, she crept back to her children. This good man, who was Mother’s\r\npersonal physician, offered to care for the five invalids. Because of\r\nthe emergency he even helped to change our garments, although there\r\nwas a rule that no man could render such assistance.\r\n\r\nSome time after the New Year, the Grand Duke Paul, in spite of his\r\nfailing health, took command of the regiments in Tsarskoe Selo. This\r\nwas most encouraging to us. All became quiet for a short period. The\r\nGrand Duke came to the palace and talked with Mother at some length.\r\nMarie heard raised voices in the next room. The conversation was mostly\r\nabout Anna Vyrubova. The public objected to her staying in the palace.\r\nAt this time her parents, the Taneevs, came from Terijoki on the\r\nGulf of Finland to be with their daughter during her illness, as she\r\ndemanded so much attention. Everyone thought that Anna with her measles\r\nrequired more care than all five of us put together. So her parents\r\ncontinued to stay with us until Anna had recovered. This increased the\r\npublic’s resentment.\r\n\r\nWe had known for a long time that an attempt had been made on Anna’s\r\nlife, in her own home, so, in order to prevent another crime, she had\r\nbeen asked to stay with us. Mother became resentful toward the Grand\r\nDuke Paul, who warned her that the palace would be stormed and that\r\nAnna would be carried away dead. Mother indignantly said that it was no\r\none’s business whom she had in her home and that she had the right to\r\nkeep anybody she wished in the palace. Mother and the Grand Duke parted\r\nin hot anger. It went on and on, so that this talk left Mother in an\r\nagitated mood.\r\n\r\nAnna was told by the others of the unpleasantness Mother had on her\r\naccount with the Grand Duke Paul. Mother had suffered many such\r\nexperiences before, just because of her strong will; she always\r\ndefended this friend from jealous creatures. Several servants, because\r\nthey so despised Anna, later reported to the Provisional Government\r\neverything that took place in the palace; they even told about the\r\nletters that Anna suggested be burned. They were dismissed and, before\r\ntheir departure, they asked to speak with Count Benckendorff. But this\r\nwas denied them. However, no one could convince Mother that Anna’s\r\npresence in our home caused a great deal of trouble and, at the same\r\ntime, endangered our lives. Even after she had recovered from her\r\nillness, Anna continued to stay with us.\r\n\r\nWhen we were little girls, Mother resented Anna’s intrusions, but when\r\nAnna confided in Mother that her parents were harsh to her, Mother\r\nfelt sorry and took the girl under her wing. Mother told Madame Zizi\r\nNarishkina that she remembered how unpleasant her own life had been\r\nwhen her own brother, Ernest, was first married. At the time, she could\r\nnot even speak to her brother and, in order to avoid conflict, with\r\nher new sister-in-law, she spent her days in her rooms. Subsequently,\r\nGranny took her to England.\r\n\r\nAnna continued to come to the house on the pretense that her husband\r\nwas away. At the same time she was telling her husband that she was\r\nbeing called for duty at the palace. When Mother found out that Anna\r\nmisrepresented the facts, she became so upset that it caused her first\r\nheart attack. At the same time, Mother’s personal physician resigned\r\nhis post because he felt that the heart attacks would continue as long\r\nas Anna was present. Mother never told us children about this, but we\r\nlearned about it from Madame Narishkina. However, to my Mother, no one\r\ncould say one word against Anna and many felt that she had some undue\r\ninfluence over the Empress.\r\n\r\nWe sisters became aware of the general feeling of the greater danger\r\nwe were facing. So we displayed coolness toward Anna. That again\r\ndispleased Mother, and she insisted that we be friendlier to Anna. She\r\nreprimanded us in spite of our weakened condition. She became angry\r\nwith Olga and Marie, and said, “I will not allow anyone to criticize\r\nmy friend.” Olga however said; “Anna, with her petty talks has made\r\nherself indispensable to you.” This, though true, so agitated Mother\r\nthat we were sorry Olga ever brought the matter up. Even Dr. Botkin\r\nfelt that, for the sake of the children, Anna should be sent back to\r\nTerijoki in Finland.\r\n\r\nNow all who entered the palace were searched, the women by a woman, and\r\nthe men by a guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII ABDICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Mogilev, Captain Nilov, Major General Prince Vasily Dolgorukov and\r\nothers with whom Father discussed the matter agreed that he should\r\nleave immediately for the capital. He was then ready to grant the\r\nConstitution. Mother also wired him to this effect. Soon afterwards a\r\ntelegram was received informing Father that the revolution in Petrograd\r\nhad been crushed. The news displeased General Ruzsky, who at that time\r\nwas the Commanding General of the Northern Front. He and others were\r\nafraid that people would accuse the Duma and himself of treason, so\r\nthey made one last attempt to damage the standing of my Father. At the\r\nsame time they knew that our troops were strong, were well provided\r\nfor, and eager for the spring offensive, for the last surprise attack,\r\nwhich was to bring a complete victory to our armies within three months.\r\n\r\nRuzsky disliked General Alexeiev and his son, and openly displayed\r\nhatred for them both. He did everything to separate Father and General\r\nAlexeiev, whom Father had known for some time and found most capable.\r\nGeneral Ruzsky also had an animosity toward Count Fredericks because he\r\nknew that the old Count was suspicious of him. General Ruzsky wanted\r\nFather to relieve the Baltic Baron from his post as Court Minister,\r\nsaying that the people resented anyone with a German name in a high\r\nposition. When Father took the Supreme Command of the Armies in the\r\nField, the Count had warned him that Ruzsky was a dangerous man and\r\nwould inevitably weaken Father’s position among the people. Granny\r\ntoo tried to discourage Father and felt that Alicky (Mother) was\r\nresponsible for this appointment. But Father was determined to correct\r\nthe inefficiency and raise the morale of his army.\r\n\r\nIt had been reported the Grand Duke Nicholai Nicholaevich was inclined\r\nto favor one officer over another with resulting injustices. General\r\nKrymov told Prince Dolgorukov at the time Father took the Supreme\r\nCommand that there was great rejoicing among the officers and soldiers.\r\nThey knew that from now on there would be no favoritism shown in the\r\narmy. The effect of this new spirit was shown in the victories that\r\nfollowed when thousands of German and Austrian soldiers were captured,\r\ntogether with vast quantities of ammunition. Every night thousands of\r\nthe enemy soldiers escaped across the border and sought sanctuary in\r\nRussia. The German High Command indeed had a good reason for ordering\r\nPrincess Vasilchikova to write numerous letters suggesting a separate\r\npeace treaty.\r\n\r\nGoing back to General Ruzsky, the officers became suspicious of the\r\nold General. Knowing that Father disliked gossip and accusations,\r\nthey were so secretly enraged with Ruzsky that they were ready to\r\nkill him. Later, Prince Dolgorukov told us that Captain Nilov, at the\r\ntime of Father’s abdication, became so furious at Ruzsky’s attitude\r\nthat he angrily struck the table with his fist and declared; “His\r\nMajesty must not abdicate! He has the Army and the peasants with him.\r\nRuzsky will destroy the Empire and the Emperor, but I will have the\r\npleasure of killing him with my own hand.” However, the rapid progress\r\nof the revolution deprived him of this privilege, and the General’s\r\nlife was spared by a narrow margin. Whoever would suspect that this\r\nnear-sighted man with thick glasses, this short, insignificant, old\r\nman with a wrinkled face whose gray hair stood up like the bristle of\r\na stiff brush was capable of spying? Even his epaulets, his sloping\r\nshoulders, were not commensurate with the military bearing one expected\r\nof a general. He was well aware of the rapidly changing conditions in\r\nPetrograd. This was the man of whom Father said; “I can never forgive\r\nRuzsky because, as a Russian general, he committed the most terrible\r\ncrime against his country.” During one of our visits to Mogilev,\r\nGeneral Ruzsky was there. He acted strangely toward Mother, trying\r\nto avoid her eyes. His nervousness indicated that his conscience was\r\nbothering him.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Father received a telegram from the Caucasus from the\r\nGrand Duke Nicholai Nicholaevich suggesting that Father abdicate. This\r\nwas a disheartening blow to Father. He knew however it was a deliberate\r\ngesture of revenge, because Father had found it necessary to relieve\r\nthe Grand Duke from his supreme command in the field. At the same time,\r\nFather had relieved Prince Orlov (Fat Orlov), who had held the position\r\nof Director of Chancery, and had sent him to the Caucasus with the\r\nGrand Duke. While Nicholai Nicholaevich was in Tiflis, he made a great\r\nimpression on the people with his enormous height and his thunderous\r\nvoice. His great physical strength and enthusiastic manner, as well as\r\nhis skilled horsemanship, added to his personal popularity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General Ewers and General Ivanov were ready to send troops\r\nto Petrograd to crush the riots. But Ruzsky wired Rodzianko, asking\r\nhim to take no action. (Rodzianko was related to Prince Youssoupoff by\r\nmarriage.) Still another blow Father received was that the Litovsky and\r\nVolinsky regiments, constituted of recruits, had capitulated to the\r\nrevolutionists. On top of this, Father was misinformed that Mother had\r\nbeen killed and that the children who had been ill were in grave danger!\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Father still at G.H.Q., felt that there was still\r\ntime to avert the revolution if he could get support from the people\r\nof Petrograd who would recognize that the coming spring offensive\r\nwould defeat Germany. He discussed this with his Chief of Staff,\r\nGeneral Alexeiev, who had confidence in the strength and loyalty of\r\nthe Army. They decided that Father should leave for the capital where\r\nhe was to grant the Constitution. But Ruzsky, Shulgin, and Guchkov\r\nprevented Father’s reaching the city on time. Purposely, by direction\r\nof the Duma, the train was shunted back and forth until the revolution\r\nhad taken a stronger root and the abdication, which Father had so\r\nstubbornly resisted all night long, was finally forced upon him.\r\n\r\nBefore Father left G.H.Q., he wired to General Khabalov in Petrograd\r\nthat riots during the war were not tolerable, and must be crushed\r\nat once. But the General wired back that it was all too late; that\r\nhis barracks were already deserted, and that the two companies of\r\nLife Guards, commanded by my paternal cousin, the Grand Duke Cyril\r\nVladimirovich, had marched through the city, led by the Grand Duke\r\nhimself with a red band on his arm and a rosette on his chest. This act\r\nalone gave untold encouragement to the revolutionists. Cyril thought\r\nthat this was the opportune moment for him, with the help of various\r\nmembers of the Imperial family, to seize the Crown.\r\n\r\nAt this time the Grand Duke Michael (Uncle Misha) who was being held\r\nat the Tauride Palace (the Duma), knew what Cyril was trying to do\r\nand refused to see him. Uncle Misha had been called from Gatchina to\r\ndiscuss the possibility of becoming Regent. The problem was complicated\r\nby the poor physical condition of the Tsarevich who, Uncle Michael\r\nfelt, could not assume the heavy burden of rule in view of the\r\ncondition the country was in and in view of his lack of experience.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cyril Vladimirovich was seeking to establish good relations\r\nwith the newly-formed government. But, even now, Rodzianko had begun\r\nto doubt the Vladimir family. All this was told to Mother by the Grand\r\nDuke Paul Alexandrovich himself.\r\n\r\nCyril proceeded to the Duma and handed over the troops under his\r\ncommand to the new regime. This was a deliberate revenge against my\r\nMother. Previous to this, Cyril and his German mother, Marie Pavlovna,\r\nthe elder (née Duchess of Mecklenburg), the widow of the Grand Duke\r\nVladimir, Father’s deceased uncle, had often spoken admiringly of\r\nBismarck, who had once been German Ambassador to Russia. They had also\r\npraised Kaiser Wilhelm, in spite of the fact that the countries were at\r\nwar. The Grand Duchess had made no secret of her sympathies. She and\r\nher son had given huge parties to which they had asked many influential\r\nfriends. We heard that among them were General Ruzsky, Princess\r\nRadziwill and Sir George Buchanan, the British Ambassador. We heard\r\nalso that they also entertained many revolutionists and German agents\r\nwho no doubt gained much valuable information as they mingled with\r\nother guests. Father received this report after our arrest in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo. The invitations to these parties were most extravagant. The\r\ndouble eagle and the crown were embossed in different shades of green,\r\nyellow, and blue with real gold sheets or red and blue enamel, pressed\r\ninto the finest grade of paper.\r\n\r\nThis attractive plotter, Marie Pavlovna (the elder) was a charming\r\npersonality and an excellent conversationalist. She did everything in\r\nher power to tarnish the names of my Father and Mother. Her son Cyril\r\nhad married the Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,\r\ngranddaughter of Queen Victoria and divorced wife of Mother’s only\r\nbrother, the Grand Duke Ernest of Hesse, who was a grandson of Queen\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nMother had had a sad experience when Victoria became Ernest’s wife,\r\nbecause of Victoria’s jealous disposition. At the time Mother had\r\nhad no choice but to live in the same home with the unhappy couple.\r\nFortunately, the benevolent Granny, Queen Victoria, soon took Mother\r\nto England. Then, when there was no sister-in-law to pick at, Victoria\r\nmade Uncle Ernest’s life miserable, and their marriage ended in divorce\r\nseveral years later. Subsequently, Victoria married Cyril, and they\r\nwere banished from Russia, but had returned just before the outbreak\r\nof World War I. Cyril expressed malicious joy when four daughters\r\nin succession were born to the Imperial couple; and later, when it\r\nbecame known that the new heir to the throne, Alexei, was afflicted\r\nwith haemophilia--which might kill him early in life--Cyril had felt\r\nthat the throne was already within his grasp. This was especially true\r\nwhen Uncle Michael was banished from Russia, after having married a\r\ndivorcée. Now Cyril’s hopes for the Crown were redoubled and his mother\r\nheld, practically, a court of her own. But these relatives of ours\r\nlived long enough to see the catastrophe in which they plunged their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhen the secret of Alexei’s haemophilia had been learned by Cyril’s\r\nmother, she suddenly, after more than thirty years of indecision,\r\ndecided to adopt the Russian orthodox religion in order to strengthen\r\nher son’s potentials for eligibility for the throne. Such maneuvering\r\nwas entirely in vain, inasmuch as the church would never have accepted,\r\nlet alone crowned, as Tsar a man whose wife’s first husband was still\r\nalive. This same factor of marriage to a divorced woman also affected\r\nthe eligibility of Uncle Michael to succession.\r\n\r\nNow at last Mother agreed to the suggestion of men who had stood by her\r\nduring the trying times: General von Grooten, Prince Putiatin, and her\r\nsecretary, Count Apraxin, who came by foot from Petrograd in the winter\r\ncold solely to tell Mother that Father was to arrive the next morning;\r\nalso Count Adam Zamoyski, A.D.C., and General Dobrovolsky. Their\r\nsuggestion was that she visit the troops assembled in the courtyard.\r\nMother and Marie, accompanied by Count Benckendorff and Count Apraxin,\r\ngreeted and thanked them for their kind services. At this time Mother\r\ncould see no noticeable difference in the men’s behavior. Count Apraxin\r\nwas a devoted friend of my parents and loyal to the end. He was deeply\r\nreligious, encouraged culture and the arts, and had a knowledge of\r\nconditions in the country.\r\n\r\nBefore the abdication, an ukase was signed by Father dismissing the\r\nold Cabinet and appointing Prince George Lvov as Prime Minister. By it\r\nthe Grand Duke Nicholai Nicholaevich was to resume his former position\r\nas Commander-in-Chief of the Army. In spite of Prince Lvov’s protest,\r\nall the old Ministers were arrested by the Provisional Cabinet, then\r\nstill under his direction. The pressure came from Kerensky, Shulgin and\r\nGuchkov, the latter a bitter enemy of Mother’s. He was, it was said,\r\ninfluenced by traitors from abroad.\r\n\r\nThere now was an epidemic of measles, flu and pneumonia in the\r\npalace. Twice a day additional doctors were permitted to attend all\r\nwho were ill, officers of the guard standing behind them during all\r\nexaminations. It was embarrassing to the patients to have these strange\r\nmen in their bedrooms. Count Benckendorff spoke to the commissar,\r\nasking that the guards remain in the hall. No extra nurses were\r\npermitted to help care for the sick.\r\n\r\nWe heard that Countess Fredericks had contracted pneumonia and been\r\ntaken to the English Hospital, then under supervision of Lady Georgina\r\nBuchanan. But the Ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, ordered that she be\r\nremoved at once. He expressed himself as being averse to helping any\r\none of the old regime, because he believed in the new social order.\r\nIn the midst of bitter cold, they carried her out on the street, but\r\na good Samaritan gave her refuge. Her crippled daughter, Emma, our\r\nfriend, was taken before the Duma, where her jewels were confiscated.\r\nThe rebels wanted to arrest the old Count but not finding him at home\r\nthey set his house on fire, destroying not only his residence but his\r\nvaluable family art collection as well. Strange to say, we knew that\r\nSir George liked us personally and also enjoyed his life and women\r\nin Russia. He had known Mother and Uncle Ernest for a long time. He\r\nhad been in our house many times enjoying meals with us, and often\r\ncame to see the newsreels of the war which were shown in our palace.\r\nThis middle aged Ambassador was admired by many women and through\r\nthem he gained popularity in Petrograd. It was said that he accepted\r\nhospitality from the highest to the lowest women of all kinds of\r\ncharacter and position. At the end he became hated by the jealous\r\nhusbands who were at the war. Later he regretted his mistakes and\r\npraised Father’s loyalty to his Allies.\r\n\r\nFather was disturbed when he heard that Sir George said he would not\r\ncare if Germany would invade his own country, England. Especially\r\nwhen Sir George helped to spread untrue stories about Mother, which\r\ndisturbed Princess Victoria of Battenberg, Mother’s older sister, who\r\nwrote Mother an upsetting letter. Father requested the Grand Marshal of\r\nthe Court, Count Benckendorff to write King George to recall Sir George\r\nfrom his post. At the same time Father ordered Peter Bark to withdraw\r\nall his personal money from the banks in England; the rapid progress of\r\nthe revolution made the withdrawal impossible.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Sir George’s wife, Lady Georgina, was most energetic in\r\nthe war work, and Father presented her with the Order of St. Catherine.\r\nShe supervised a sewing group at the Embassy, also the Anglo-Russian\r\nhospital on the Nevsky Prospect, and was the head of the British\r\nconvalescent home.\r\n\r\nThe Provisional Government sent General von Grooten, Commandant of\r\nTsarskoe Selo, to prison. It also placed under arrest Colonel Girardi,\r\nChief of Police, General Resin, once the Commandant of the Combined\r\nRegiments, and Prince Putiatin. Mother sent A.D.C. Captain Linevich,\r\none of Father’s closest friends, to negotiate with Rodzianko but we\r\nnever saw him again. He too was arrested. About this time we were\r\ntold to have our bags ready to leave Russia at a moment’s notice. Our\r\nsuitcases and our trunks were brought from the storerooms and were\r\nplaced upstairs in two rooms. Mother, when free from nursing duties,\r\nselected the most important articles to be packed. But everything that\r\nwent into these trunks later was checked by the new masters.\r\n\r\nWe heard that two revolutionary divisions were marching toward Tsarskoe\r\nSelo with tanks and armored cars, to storm the palace, but the harsh\r\nwintry weather prevented them from reaching the village. One night,\r\nsoon afterwards, all the lights went out for about twenty minutes. The\r\ncourtyard, the park, the gates, everything was dark. Then our water\r\nsupply was cut off, but fortunately it was soon restored. Also the lift\r\nat the end of the hall was put out of commission and Mother had to be\r\ncarried to the second floor. All these events kept us in a continual\r\nstate of apprehension, and we became frightened, thinking that the\r\nrebels were trying to get into the grounds.\r\n\r\nLater we were told that on this dark night, the rebels had attempted\r\nto remove Rasputin’s body from the grave, by order of the Provisional\r\nGovernment. Not knowing the exact location, they dug up the body of our\r\nold butler, who had died about the same time as Rasputin, and burned\r\nhis remains in the Pergolovo forest. It was this faithful butler who\r\ncarried my great-grandfather, Alexander II, into the Winter Palace\r\nthe day he was killed. Since then he had continued as a family butler\r\nuntil, years before, illness overtook him, after which time he was\r\ncared for by the family.\r\n\r\nThe rumor which said that Mother had ordered Rasputin’s body to be\r\nburied in the park in Tsarskoe Selo was not true. She had nothing to do\r\nwith his burial, although she had sent a message suggesting that his\r\nbody should be shipped to his family in Siberia. It was Anna Vyrubova’s\r\ndesire to have this man buried on the property she owned on the other\r\nside of the Alexander Park gate and the Alexandrovka village, near the\r\nwoods on the high road to Viborg. Anna believed that he had saved her\r\nlife and she paid the expenses of the funeral, which was officiated\r\nover by Father Vassiliev. The gossip continued that we had signed an\r\nicon especially to be placed in Rasputin’s coffin. It was true that\r\nshortly before his death we had signed an icon which was for the coffin\r\nof one of our tutor’s sons who had been killed. But as Father had\r\nalready sent one for the tutor’s son’s coffin, the other icon that had\r\nbeen signed was placed in the butler’s coffin.\r\n\r\nThe first unfounded rumors about Rasputin started a long way back.\r\nThere was a foreign representative who antagonized the Christians in\r\nPersia. My Father--defender of Christianity--was informed about this\r\nman’s malicious actions and used his influence to have this instigator\r\nremoved from his diplomatic post in Persia. Since then this man was\r\nlooking for an opportunity to strike back at the Imperial Family.\r\nWith the help of a collaborator he wrote a book most insinuating in\r\nits nature and based on malicious lies. The collaborator demanded\r\n$60,000 from my Mother to prevent the publication of this slanderous\r\nbook, but Mother ignored this threat, and refused to be blackmailed,\r\nfor there was absolutely no truth in their accusation. During the\r\nwar the contents of this book was circulated throughout Russia, thus\r\npoisoning the minds of the people against my Mother. With their first\r\nventure a success, they now started a vicious campaign against Father\r\nby picturing him as weak, irresponsible and incapable of holding the\r\nCrown, and by so doing they rendered the Bolsheviks a most useful\r\nservice. Yet none of these instigators knew Father personally for they\r\nhad never had an opportunity to set foot inside the village of Tsarskoe\r\nSelo.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon at home the mutineers insisted on seeing Mother and\r\nAlexei, because of a rumor that Alexei had died or escaped. Mother,\r\naccompanied by Count Benckendorff and Marie, went out on the balcony.\r\nIn a voice, clear but weak, she said; “I hear you want to see me and my\r\nson, but why? My son is critically ill, and he must not expose himself\r\nto cold. To see him is impossible at this time. For myself I am only a\r\nmother who is nursing her sick children.” They left without a single\r\nword. That same unlucky evening, March 13th, Marie became ill and was\r\ntaken into the sick room with a high temperature. With the help of\r\nBaroness Buxhoeveden, Madame Dehn, Dr. Botkin, and several nurses and\r\nmaids, Mother managed to take care of all the invalids.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this confusion, word reached Mother of Father’s\r\nabdication. Then later in the same afternoon the Grand Duke Paul\r\nreturned, with a bulletin announcing Father’s abdication. He expressed\r\nsympathy for our plight and suggested that we leave Russia as soon as\r\npossible. Mother burst into tears saying, “Russia is lost; Russia was\r\nbetrayed.” Mother could not bear to convey this news to Alexei, and\r\nasked M. Gilliard to do so. Alexei’s reaction was to say; “How can that\r\nbe? Father promised Alexander III that Russia would always remain an\r\nautocracy, and Father had to swear to uphold this type of rule.” It\r\ndid not occur to him that Father no longer was the Emperor and that\r\nhe himself no longer was the Tsarevich. He was thinking only of the\r\nlife of Russia. With all his troubles, he never thought selfishly of\r\nhimself. To us sisters, Mother with quivering lips gave details of the\r\nrecent happenings. Soon afterwards, boxes containing Father’s various\r\ndocuments, including the abdication papers and the speech he had\r\ndelivered to his beloved army, arrived at the palace.\r\n\r\nWe knew that Mother had been tortured with the thought that Father had\r\nbeen shot; now we learned that Father too had been tormented with the\r\nrumor that she had been murdered. But soon we heard that Father was\r\non his way to Petrograd; that when he was about to leave, Shulgin and\r\nGuchkov arrived in Mogilev. Father was surprised when he saw how Ruzsky\r\nreceived these men with the warmest greetings. Father knew then that\r\nthey were bosom friends and that Ruzsky was a spy.\r\n\r\nSix men were responsible for the delay which prevented Father’s train\r\nfrom reaching the capital. The train was delayed by the railway\r\nofficials on orders from the Duma, in order to give the revolution a\r\nchance to become solidified. Kerensky worked from Petrograd; Guchkov,\r\nKalenin, Gribushchin and Shulgin were on the train with Father; and\r\nat the other end was General Ruzsky, Commander of the Northern Front,\r\nlocated in Pskov. When Mother heard this, she said; “I urged Father\r\nto close the Duma long ago. Before Papa left for G.H.Q., he was\r\ndiscouraged with the Duma and left a signed order with the Premier,\r\nPrince Golitsyn, to dissolve it at once, but the Premier failed to\r\ncarry out his orders.”\r\n\r\nImmediately after Father’s abdication, two of his close friends came\r\nto see him. One was General Count Keller and the other was General\r\nKhan of Nakhichevan. Both were Generals of the Guard and had known\r\nFather for many years. They asked Father’s permission to send their\r\ntroops to Petrograd to suppress the revolution. Father was in favor of\r\nthis, but since he was no longer in power, he suggested that they make\r\nthis proposal to the Provisional Government. No doubt General Ruzsky\r\nreceived the offer of these two generals, but purposely tabled their\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nFrom Pskov Father’s train went back to Mogilev to enable him to take\r\nleave of his beloved Army. Here once more General Count Keller came to\r\nsee Father. He kissed his hand, saying; “Your Majesty, I would rather\r\nbe dead, before I would serve any other government.” Later, I heard, he\r\nshot himself or was shot.\r\n\r\nIn Mogilev, General Alexeiev, Father’s trusted friend, now made known\r\nthat Father was a prisoner. Present were a number of generals and the\r\ncommittee of the newly formed government, and several grand dukes,\r\nincluding Boris Vladimirovich, Cyril’s brother, who wanted to see\r\nFather, but General Voyeykov said that the Emperor could not see him.\r\n\r\nSoon after Father’s farewell speech to the Army, the General Staff took\r\nthe loyalty pledge to the Provisional Government, which then ordered\r\nthat Father’s initials be removed from their epaulets, but these men\r\nrefused to remove them, saying that they would kill the traitors before\r\nthey would do such a thing. And Father said, “Now, it is too late.”\r\n\r\nPrince Dolgorukov later related to us that Father’s tears were\r\nstreaming down his face and that he turned away from the window of his\r\nstudy which was facing the parade ground. He could not see this painful\r\nperformance inflicted upon his beloved Army. Before he left G.H.Q., he\r\nreceived the news that Granny was on her way to Mogilev. He dreaded a\r\nmeeting with her, as she usually distressed him so much that he found\r\nher harder to handle than all of his ministers put together. He saw\r\nher on the train; she blessed him and they parted forever.\r\n\r\nLater after several days aboard the train, Father finally reached\r\nTsarskoe Selo, on March 9/22, 1917, at 11:30 A.M. Here at the pavilion\r\n(station) many of Father’s lifelong friends his trusted officers\r\nand his favorite aides-de-camp, who had come on the train with him,\r\ndeparted in an effort to save their own lives. It was said, though no\r\none ever will know whether this really was true, that on the train\r\nthat same morning before they reached Tsarskoe Selo they were told\r\nthat if they stayed with Father they would be shot. “They deserted me\r\nin my saddest hour,” said Father. Among those of whom he spoke were\r\nCyril Narishkin, chief of his mobile secretariat, the son of our dear\r\nZizi Narishkina, the Mistress of the Robes; and also Count Grabbe,\r\nan A.D.C., whom we had known since our childhood. I remember when he\r\naccompanied us sisters on long walks on the shore in the Crimea and the\r\ntime when I, in mischievous play, poured sand down his neck. Others\r\nwho deserted Father were a Duke of Leuchtenberg and our friend A.D.C.\r\nMordvinov whose daughter I knew and liked, and Sablin, whom we children\r\nloved like one of our own, once a lieutenant on the “Standard.” All\r\nof them had been close associates and friends. Captain Drenteln,\r\na most beloved friend and a member of a battalion of Father’s own\r\nPreobrazhensky regiment, also disappeared.\r\n\r\nFather came directly upstairs to Mother. He found Marie and myself\r\ndesperately ill; I was only partly conscious. At first I thought that\r\nI dreamed of his being home. A few days later I realized how bad he\r\nlooked. He was thin and his eyes were sad. His left shoulder shook\r\nnervously, much more than before. Only later Prince Dolgorukov told us\r\nof the unpleasant experience Father had upon his arrival at Tsarskoe\r\nSelo. Father had left the pavilion (station) and had received a shock\r\nupon seeing that his chauffeur was already dressed in civilian clothes.\r\nAn even greater shock awaited him: although all the guards on duty,\r\nboth at the outside gate and at the Palace entry, had been informed\r\nof the exact hour for the arrival of the Emperor, they showed their\r\nnewly-acquired importance by asking the chauffeur over the phone for\r\nthe identity of the occupants of the car. Both times the chauffeur\r\nreplied, “It’s His Majesty.” With deliberateness, they replied, “Let\r\nNicholai Alexandrovich pass through.” Father was very angry at this\r\ncurt treatment and was surprised to see the antechamber packed with\r\npeople, only a few of whom he knew. He passed by without saying a word.\r\nWhen Mother heard of his arrival, she ran breathlessly down the stairs\r\nand the full length of the long corridor and fell sobbing into his\r\narms. Both of them came directly upstairs.\r\n\r\nWe were told that the same afternoon several men from the Provisional\r\nGovernment appeared to question Father at length.\r\n\r\nAt this time these terrible men ordered the staff wearing Father’s\r\nbadges on their shoulders to have them removed, without Father’s\r\nconsent, and to have Father and the family placed under arrest. Now\r\nMordvinov wanted to come to the palace, but the Government forbade it.\r\n\r\nFather brought home copies of his abdication and his farewell speech\r\nto the Army. We were able to learn more about the abdication which\r\nhad taken place at 3:00 P.M. on March 2/15, 1917, in the study of his\r\nprivate train at the railroad station in Pskov. Later after talking\r\nwith Dr. Fedorov, Alexei’s physician, Father abdicated also on behalf\r\nof the Tsarevich in favor of his brother Michael, although Father\r\nknew that the Holy Synod of the Russian Church would not recognize\r\nMichael as Heir to the Throne. But he did so, in order to avoid a\r\nbloody revolution. We were also told by those who had been with Father\r\non the train, that General Ruzsky threatened Father, saying “If the\r\nEmperor will not sign it now, I would hate to say what may happen to\r\nhis family.” With swimming eyes we read the touching words in which he\r\nasked his people to uphold the Provisional Government and to try to be\r\nloyal to it. Following is my Father’s farewell address.\r\n\r\n\r\n LEAVE OF THE ARMY\r\n\r\n I address you for the last time, soldiers so dear to my heart. Since I\r\n have renounced in my name, and that of my son, the Throne of Russia,\r\n the powers I exercised have been transmitted to the Provisional\r\n Government which has been formed on the initiative of the Imperial\r\n Duma.\r\n\r\n May God help it lead Russia on the path of glory and prosperity.\r\n\r\n May God bless you also, glorious soldiers, to defend our native land\r\n against a cruel enemy. For two and a half years you have in every hour\r\n undergone the fatigues and strain of a wearing campaign, much blood\r\n has been spilt, great efforts have been crowned with success, and\r\n already the hour is at hand when Russia with her splendid allies will\r\n finally crush by one joint and daring effort the last resistance of\r\n the enemy.\r\n\r\n A war such as this, unknown in history, must be continued to the final\r\n and definite victory. Whoever dreams of peace or desires it--at this\r\n moment--is a traitor to his country and yields it to the enemy.\r\n\r\n Carry out your duty, protect our beloved and glorious country, submit\r\n yourselves to the Provisional Government, render obedience to your\r\n chiefs, and remember that any slackness in your service means a gain\r\n to your enemies.\r\n\r\n With the firm conviction that the boundless love that you have for our\r\n great country will ever remain in your hearts,\r\n\r\n I pray that God may bless you, and that St. George the Great Martyr\r\n may lead you to victory.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) Nicholas\r\n  (Countersigned) Alexeiev, C.G.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nFather’s speech was a heavy blow to his men; they were stunned from\r\nthe shock. One of his personal guards had a heart attack while Father\r\nwas speaking. Father urged the troops to continue the war, at any\r\nprice, until victory was complete. The hour was at hand, he said, when\r\nRussia would finally crush the last resistance of the enemy. But this\r\nresistance did not materialize, nor, in fact, did the Emperor’s own\r\nplanned powerful attack. Some people of the upper classes in Petrograd\r\nfailed to support him in regard to this final blow against the enemy,\r\ndesigned to win the war within three months, as Father had promised in\r\nhis last speech before the Duma in Petrograd a short while before. It\r\nwas not Father’s war, but the war of the nation. When Uncle Michael\r\ncame to urge Father to return immediately to G.H.Q., he found Father on\r\nthe verge of departure, despite the serious condition of Alexei.\r\n\r\nThe current malicious gossip was more important to the political\r\nleaders than was the destiny of their country. These same leaders\r\nafterwards criticized Father, saying that because he loved his family\r\nso much, fear of having his family killed caused him to abdicate.\r\nThe killing of his family would not have solved the problem, which\r\nwould have been solved easily by the leaders themselves had they not\r\nsupported the traitors and not spread unfounded lies, especially about\r\nmy Father, whose men were shedding their blood at the front. If I may\r\nask, in what had we children sinned before our people that we should\r\nhave to give up our lives--we children who, from the oldest to the\r\nyoungest, denied ourselves all amusement and devoted our energy to the\r\nwar effort? Should we children have had to pay the penalty of death?\r\nWhy did not those busy conspirators take their weapons and go to fight\r\nthe common enemy?\r\n\r\nThey could not say anything against my older sisters, upon whom they\r\nhad never had an opportunity to lay their eyes. What they said about\r\nme, because of my innocent jokes and pranks, I have never given a rap\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Botkin read Father’s last addresses, his eyes moistened and\r\nhe added, “Only His Imperial Majesty could speak such deep words.”\r\nFather repeated the words of Tsar Nicholas I: “Gde raz podniat Russkii\r\nflag, on uzhe spuskatsia ne dolzhen.” (Where once the Russian flag is\r\nraised, it shall never be lowered.)\r\n\r\nLittle by little we received more details. At first Father abdicated\r\nin favor of Alexei, with Uncle Michael as Regent. But after consulting\r\nDr. Fedorov about his son’s delicate health, Father abdicated also for\r\nAlexei in favor of his brother Michael, who was called in from Gatchina\r\nto Petrograd, to accept first the Regency, and then the Throne. To\r\nFather’s intense disappointment Uncle Misha, after accepting, soon\r\nabdicated because of pressure by the Provisional Government, in whose\r\nhands the nation’s fate then rested. This new government placed under\r\narrest many ministers and high officials, because they refused to sign\r\nthe loyalty pledge to the Provisional Government. What was happening in\r\nPetrograd at this time Father did not know until he reached home.\r\n\r\nGeneral Ruzsky and others, in order to hide their crime, spread the\r\nmost heartless rumor that Father had been drinking wine before his\r\nabdication. However, Father was not alone during this painful ordeal.\r\nWith him on the train was his friend, the Minister of the Household\r\nof the Court, Prince Vasily Dolgorukov; Flag Captain Nilov, A.D.C.;\r\nGeneral Voyeykov, Chief of Administration of the Palaces in Tsarskoe\r\nSelo; Count Vladimir Fredericks, Father’s Chamberlain; and the latter’s\r\nassistant, General Mossolov. Others present on the train were A.D.C.\r\nCount Grabbe, Commandant of an Escort; A.D.C. Captain Drenteln; A.D.C.\r\nCyril Narishkin, head of the Chancery; Colonel Mordvinov and General\r\nDubensky. The Provisional Government was represented by Kerensky’s\r\nfriend, Vershchinin, and others.\r\n\r\nPrince Dolgorukov spoke to us of this merciless rumor, saying that\r\nFather at the time drank only tea and paced back and forth in his\r\nstudy. Father’s valet and his butler, after reading this lie, saw\r\nCount Benckendorff and in tears said that those who spread such a lie\r\nhad committed a great sin toward their Emperor. It was also said that\r\nduring the last night on the train Father sat up all night in his\r\nstudy. At midnight one of the engineer officers, who previously had\r\nconducted many trips during Father’s travels, asked to see Father and\r\nwas received. He sank to his knees, kissed Father’s hand and tearfully\r\nsaid, “Your Majesty, I will never serve these bandits. It is the end\r\nof my life.” After the train reached the pavilion in Tsarskoe Selo and\r\njust as Father was getting into his automobile and as the standing\r\nofficers were saluting Father for the last time, a shot was heard and\r\nthe engineer officer fell dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III Arrest And Exile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV ARREST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was decided to separate Mother from the rest of the family. But\r\nFather objected, saying that it would be cruel to take Mother from\r\nher sick children. At last it was conceded that Father should stay\r\ndownstairs in his apartment and Mother on the second floor with us.\r\n\r\nNow that we all were under arrest, Mother was allowed to remain with\r\nthe sick children upstairs and Father was permitted to join his family\r\nat mealtime. But all the conversation at the table had to be carried on\r\nonly in the Russian language. I was told that our private wing of the\r\npalace was strongly guarded by a new kind of guard. They were noisy and\r\noverbearing. Mother warned everybody to be courteous to the sentry.\r\n\r\nHad we children not been ill, Father would have insisted that we go to\r\nEngland; at least the children if Mother had refused to leave. From\r\nwhat he said later, we were convinced that he himself would not have\r\nleft Russia.\r\n\r\nAt once Kerensky appointed his communist friend Korovichenko, whom he\r\ncalled his governor, as a commissar over us. This man proved to be\r\nrude, dishonest, insulting, ignorant, and he quarrelled with everyone\r\nin our household, disturbing and annoying us every hour of the day. The\r\nguards were selected for the same qualities as those of their masters.\r\nWe were grateful when General Kornilov sent Colonel Kobylinsky and\r\nCommissar Makarov to replace the cruel Korovichenko.\r\n\r\nFrom my sick bed all this was hard to imagine. I could not believe\r\nit, until I was able to sit up by the window. I noticed that the\r\nappearance and the action of the soldiers and officers were not the\r\nsame. Gradually our health improved. Tatiana had temporarily lost her\r\nhearing and we had to write communications for her. Alexei’s condition\r\nwas still not up to par.\r\n\r\nTo kill our dull moments we played light games, worked on word games\r\nand other puzzles and listened to French history read to us by Mlle.\r\nSchneider.\r\n\r\nWe were told that Kerensky was coming to see us. The name Kerensky\r\nbrought terror to our hearts. Was he not the instigator behind the\r\ntreatment that Father was receiving? We waited, dreading his visit.\r\nWhen the time of his arrival drew near, we were filled with antagonism\r\nand fear. We were told that it was this enraged man, Kerensky, and his\r\ncommunist friend, Korovichenko, who had assembled our employees in the\r\nlarge hall. Kerensky told them that they were no longer working for\r\nus, and that they were from now on to take orders only from those who\r\npaid their wages. He meant of course the Provisional Government, who\r\nappropriated the money belonging to the people of Russia and us. But\r\nthey themselves were paid to live in an abundance such as one could\r\nonly read about in fiction.\r\n\r\nSome of the servants were bribed to spy on us and Anna. A few servants\r\nhated Anna to such an extent that they notified Kerensky of Anna’s\r\nimproved condition. Kerensky angrily ordered Anna to dress at once,\r\nand she was then taken to prison. Alexei never before heard such rough\r\nvoices and he burst out crying. “Will he kill us?” he asked his tutor.\r\nThose two men not only disturbed the family but upset everybody. I saw\r\nthese men passing by on their way to the classroom where they were to\r\nsee my parents. Father brought Kerensky into a room and introduced my\r\ntwo older sisters, by merely saying, “My daughters, Olga and Tatiana.”\r\nMarie and I were still in bed, recovering from our illness.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw Kerensky, a man of medium height, he appeared to be\r\nnervously twisting his finger. His face was pale and ugly, with small\r\ngreenish eyes imbedded in a peculiarly shaped head, which was flat on\r\ntop. His brown hair stood up similar to General Ruzsky’s. Whenever\r\nI see a man like this, it always has an unpleasant connotation for\r\nme. Outside in the hall and behind him, there was a committee of\r\nworkers, allegedly soldiers and sailors but really nothing but released\r\nconvicts, untidy, rough-looking individuals, who were armed with\r\ndaggers and hand grenades. We were frightened. At first, I thought I\r\nwas seeing this nightmare with my feverish eyes.\r\n\r\nWith the help of foreign spies, and convicts released by Kerensky and\r\nthe new leaders, these traitors were anxious to break the morale of the\r\narmies. They told the soldiers that the land was to be divided among\r\nthem, but first they should return home in order to receive their share\r\nof land. They said that it was a case of first come, first served, and\r\ninasmuch as capital punishment had been abolished, wholesale desertions\r\nfrom the armed forces resulted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the munitions and other factories fell into the hands\r\nof the new government and many were set on fire. So the soldiers,\r\nlacking supplies, had no choice but to desert their posts. All this\r\nhelped the enemy who was ready to collapse. Thanks to Kerensky for the\r\nruination of the army.\r\n\r\nWhen the arrest of my family, especially of Father, became known to the\r\npublic, it caused a harmful effect on the morale of the Army, and in\r\ngeneral the situation became dangerous. Many soldiers left their posts\r\nin panic; even in Tsarskoe Selo, Father’s own military escort, not from\r\nchoice but from fear, displayed red ribbons. The rebels were freeing\r\ncriminals who were breaking into wine cellars and becoming intoxicated.\r\n\r\nThe snow was very heavy that winter, and the new leaders cared little\r\nabout having it cleared away. There was only a narrow space available\r\nwhere Father and the others could walk about. This proved actually to\r\nbe a godsend to Father, because exercise was vital to his health and\r\nwas the only activity permitted him at this time. Each day from the\r\nwindow I watched Father shovel snow. No doubt that for Father it was\r\nmuch more than exercise. His physical exertions enabled him to maintain\r\nhis mental faculties in every respect.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning he had an unpleasant experience, during his outdoor\r\nexercise, when he was allowed to walk in only a small area close to the\r\npalace. One day on his return from his walk, he extended his hand to\r\none of the soldiers, but the man refused to take it. This was hard on\r\nFather and made him realize the extent and intensity of the propaganda\r\nagainst him. Father’s philosophical attitude toward these incidents\r\nmade him a greater hero in our eyes.\r\n\r\nTo us children, Kerensky was at first a beast, a dragon waiting to\r\ndevour us. His repeated visits kept us filled with terror. He thought\r\nat first that he could come to the palace at any time and wander about\r\nin our own home, without permission from the proper authority and\r\nwithout Father’s consent. Kerensky, always accompanied by the Marshal\r\nof the Court, followed by a messenger, was received in Father’s study.\r\n\r\nFather was always courteous, wishing to make everything easy for the\r\nnew government. But this man Kerensky at first did not seem to know the\r\nmeaning of courtesy. After a while he saw Father’s ready cooperation\r\nand became quite human. We children began to feel more relaxed in his\r\npresence. After several conversations with Kerensky, our parents felt\r\nmore confidence in him. However, Mother could not forget the recent\r\ninjustice she had suffered, and she hoped her innocence was now proven.\r\nBut Kerensky had made no attempt to inform the public of the true\r\nsituation at the palace. He was responsible for Anna’s arrest, and\r\nMother could not forgive him, especially since she believed that Anna\r\nwas still ill when she was sent to prison. Madame Lili Dehn also had\r\nto leave the palace at the same time. Moreover Madame Zizi Narishkina\r\nbecame ill with pneumonia and left the palace because Mother felt she\r\nwould receive better care at a hospital.\r\n\r\nThis wise little lady was a favorite of my Father whom she had known\r\nsince his childhood. She was like a mother to our Mother. Her kindness\r\nand simplicity was written all over her face. She insisted that she be\r\naddressed as Madame instead of Princess, yet she was a true-blooded\r\nPrincess. Among us she called my Father Nicky. In spite of her old\r\nage, she too had been a victim of unfair criticism. It caused so much\r\nresentment that the newspapers had been forced to retract their false\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nEven my Aunt Olga, who loved peasants, had been condemned because she\r\nenjoyed visiting and accepting their hospitality.\r\n\r\nOur prison hours were well regulated. We were permitted two walks\r\nduring the day, between 11-12 and 2-5. With nervous excitement we\r\nwaited the designated hour, eager not to miss one second of the\r\nout-of-doors. As the clock struck eleven, we and the staff gathered\r\nin the semicircular room where we were to meet the guards who were to\r\naccompany us on our walks. We had to wait sometimes as much as one\r\nhalf hour. This meant our walk was sometimes curtailed that much. We\r\nfelt cheated, and the thought that Father could do nothing about it\r\nmade us feel worse. We discovered that the more we fretted, the longer\r\nthe delay; so we learned to wait submissively. The key to the circular\r\nroom was held by the commissar on duty, and the other doors, including\r\nthe balcony facing the Znamensky Cathedral and the gate, were sealed.\r\nWe had to wait until the commandant appeared with the key to open the\r\ndoor. Since Korovichenko was as a rule basking himself in the sun, he\r\nmade it a habit of being late. Even the sentries hated the sight of\r\nthis man. When we did go out finally, we walked briskly to cover lost\r\nground. Sometimes we crossed the bridge over the ravine, since the area\r\nwas less exposed to the public view. But because of demonstrations our\r\nafternoon walks soon were scheduled later and we were outdoors until\r\n8:00 P.M. Our friends helped us with our garden work. M. Gilliard\r\nproved well-nigh indispensable.\r\n\r\nAt first we had no news from our relatives. But we were pleasantly\r\nsurprised when several letters came to Father and to Tatiana from Aunt\r\nXenia at Ai-Todor in the Crimea. The letters giving us news of the\r\nfamily were the only joy we had had since our arrest. Our mail was\r\ncensored and parts of the letters we received were inked out.\r\n\r\nProbably Aunt Xenia found our letters dry and uninteresting. But we\r\nwrote them reluctantly, as in a daze--we so strongly felt the blow of\r\nthe happenings in our country and to its people. The shock was so great\r\nthat no outsider ever will know the feeling unless he lives through\r\na similar experience, that is, if he loved his country. We were glad\r\nGranny was there too. It was her first stay in the Crimea since the\r\ndeath of her husband, Alexander III. We had been wanting to write to\r\nthem but we feared repercussions.\r\n\r\nFor months we waited for a reply to our letters which we were obliged\r\nto leave unsealed for censorship. We hoped that our coming departure\r\nwould take us to the Crimea to be together with the rest of the\r\nfamily. Father hungrily read the newspapers, even though the ones he\r\nreceived had been thoroughly censored, parts of them inked out. All\r\ntoo often the papers were withheld altogether. Father read every word\r\ncarefully to find some clue to the real truth. One of our best sources\r\nof information came from the various members of our household. Before\r\nlong they too no longer were free to leave the palace. All around our\r\nhome there was a strong guard posted, especially in the small garden in\r\nfront of Mother’s windows and the garden gate across from the Znamensky\r\nCathedral, which was the closest to Mother’s balcony. She was very much\r\ndisturbed, having these men watch her windows; she never could look\r\nout. During this time we saw some one drive in and out of the courtyard\r\nin Father’s favorite automobile, a Packard sledge (sleigh). Kerensky of\r\ncourse often used our private cars, chauffeurs, and even our valuable\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nAfter midnight another unpleasant incident occurred. Several uncouth\r\nrevolutionists, headed by a Pole named Mstislavsky, came from\r\nPetrograd. They proceeded to show their thievish authority by ordering\r\nthe telephone and telegraph lines from the outside disconnected. After\r\na great deal of bickering and fighting with the guards, who would not\r\nlet them enter the grounds, Mstislavsky broke down the gate with his\r\nheavy artillery trucks. It caused such a noise that a large number of\r\npersons collected on the avenue and loud voices were heard from the\r\nangry crowd. This noise awakened the household. The bandits forced\r\nthemselves towards and into the palace, in spite of everything. They\r\nwere armed and threatened the officers on duty, “Shoot us, or we will\r\nshoot you.” Count Benckendorff and Prince Dolgorukov came down and told\r\nMstislavsky and his companions that it was impossible for them to talk\r\nto the Emperor. The intruders were asked to produce the required permit\r\nfrom General Kornilov, commanding the troops in the area at this time.\r\nThe officers on duty then said, “You arrest us, or we will arrest you.”\r\nNotwithstanding, the bandits went upstairs to the gallery room. There\r\nthey encountered Father who was walking toward them. Without a word the\r\nbandits ran away in terror.\r\n\r\nKerensky was held responsible for this incident, having revealed to\r\nMstislavsky the anticipated departure of the Imperial family for\r\nEngland via Murmansk.\r\n\r\nSubsequently we heard that Mstislavsky ordered many innocent families\r\nshot, people who were in his way; also he and his friends seized from\r\nthem anything to their liking.\r\n\r\nWe shortly learned that all escape routes were already blocked.\r\n\r\nKorovichenko’s transfer lifted our hopes. His place was filled by\r\nColonel Eugene Kobylinsky, an officer of the Imperial Guard. We were\r\nthankful to General Kornilov for sending this wonderful man, who served\r\nmy family faithfully in spite of many dangers to his own life. He was\r\nsincerely anxious to alleviate our condition and was determined to save\r\nus. But with many hundreds of men in our guard he was helpless, as any\r\naction of his would have drawn suspicion upon him. He went with us to\r\nTobolsk and stayed there until four days before our departure, when\r\nhe became dangerously ill. Consequently, we did not see this kind man\r\nagain before we left for Ekaterinburg. Another well-disposed man was\r\nCommissar Makarov, a very intelligent and cultured person with a great\r\ndeal of tact and knowledge of several languages.\r\n\r\nHe had a prison record for having killed a policeman. For this, this\r\nfine looking man paid fifteen years of his young life before he was\r\nreleased. He accepted his punishment as having been deserved. His\r\nimprisonment had not embittered him, and his gentle, kind manners had\r\nnot changed.\r\n\r\nMany of the guards we had known from our childhood. Whenever possible\r\nColonel Kobylinsky tried to have these men accompany us during our\r\nwalks, as these guards could not tolerate an abusive attitude of\r\nothers toward us. Nevertheless, he did not dare to defend us. By this\r\ntime the Provisional Government had become convinced that Father had\r\nno intention of making trouble for them. Father eagerly followed the\r\ncourse of the war and grieved at the way it was going. If only he could\r\nhave now had a part in it, even as a private!\r\n\r\nThere were secret messages suggesting our escape to Germany. Father\r\nanswered, “No, we shall not escape like convicts.” One day Father was\r\nwalking, Alexei was sitting on the bench, with his dog Joy at his feet,\r\nand we sisters were a short distance from Father, when a large enclosed\r\ncar rapidly drove in and two young men in it wanted Father and Alexei\r\nto get into the car and escape with them. Father was very upset by it.\r\nHe said, “Go at once.” Soon after more new guards appeared.\r\n\r\nDuring this time we became tired of eating cabbages and carrots. We\r\nlonged for something different. Those days no green vegetables came out\r\nof the greenhouses. Father saw the rich fields for labor lying open to\r\nus, and he was willing to work. So, in the spring, Father suggested a\r\nvegetable garden be planted in an open space where some trees had been\r\ncut down. We were all eager for outdoor exercise. Count Fredericks\r\ntalked it over with Colonel Kobylinsky who gave permission to go ahead.\r\nWe were now full of enthusiasm, with plenty of ideas of fresh food as\r\nour objective.\r\n\r\nFather began to work, and even Mother, for the first time, cheerfully\r\nwas willing to leave the house in the afternoon. She was wheeled in\r\nher chair into the garden. She sat under a tree near the brook, while\r\nthe guards paced back and forth on the bridge. Mother seldom walked\r\nthose days. We planted the seeds and watered the vegetable beds from a\r\nbarrel. As I worked, I thought of the words in the beautiful Russian\r\nsong which said:\r\n\r\n    “The Christ had a garden, where many roses bloomed,\r\n    He watered them thrice a day to make a wreath for himself.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the demonstrations, we worked late in the day, often till\r\n8:00 P.M. In the evening Father read to us while we were sewing or\r\nknitting. When the first green shoots appeared, we were thrilled with\r\nthe thought of salads within a month. The seedlings grew into bushy\r\nplants. The blossoms became tiny beans. In another week or so we would\r\nhave our first harvest from sixty luxuriant beds in all. Spring, which\r\nalways seems to hold a special appeal for all Russians, was beautiful\r\nbut sad for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV SUBJUGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the first days of July with their white nights were approaching,\r\na time when night is much like day in those northern regions, when\r\ntwilight spreads a kind of magic transparency in the distant sky and\r\nwoods, we saw creeping figures with shining bayonets emerge from the\r\nbushes. They were watching the windows of the prisoners. I wish I did\r\nnot love that great country with so much promise, whose soul lies in\r\ndebris now and of which I cannot speak without the feeling of a heavy\r\nweight on my chest.\r\n\r\nBefore the leaves came out, we withdrew to an area where we thought we\r\ncould not be seen so easily. That led us to the greenhouses. We found\r\nthem dreadfully neglected. No one had taken care of the plants. The\r\ngardeners had been discharged or put to work in some other capacity.\r\nNow many rare and valuable bushes surrounding the colonnades were cut\r\ndown against everybody’s objection. The orders, we were told, came from\r\nKerensky. Tears were in Father’s eyes to see such destruction.\r\n\r\nWe realized that the iron fence which protected us from the outside was\r\nnow our prison wall. The driveway was a source of fear. Even the bushes\r\nand the trees of our beloved park secreted spies who watched every move\r\nwe made. Even though we were accustomed to isolation from the world\r\nby a cordon of police and military protection, being surrounded by\r\nunfriendly guards was indeed depressing.\r\n\r\nDuring the turbulent days, even the swans cried mournfully every\r\nmorning because they knew we were in the palace, and they felt that\r\nsomething was wrong that we did not speak to them and feed them. Even\r\nthese majestic birds must have known....\r\n\r\nOur food now was ice-cold, more so than ever before. Our kitchens were\r\nin a separate building and the food was wheeled through the long tunnel\r\nin large carriers which had to be opened for inspection. Therefore the\r\nfood cooled off before it reached our apartments.\r\n\r\nSometimes we played on the “Children’s Island.” On several occasions\r\nAlexei went out in a rowboat with his toy sailboats, but was not\r\nallowed to enter his little four-room playhouse where he used to play\r\nwith his cousins and young cadets. It was locked up and his rowboat\r\ntaken away, making him very unhappy.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed our cycling, Father and Alexei on bicycles and we four girls\r\non velocipedes. In the afternoon even Mother went into the woods and\r\nsat in the shade with her tapestry work, copying the original pattern\r\nof her Hepplewhite chair, while Father, his officer friends and others\r\nwere cutting down the dead trees. We sisters helped to carry the\r\nsmaller pieces and built tall stacks for the wood to dry during the\r\nsummer months.\r\n\r\nWe heard that our friend Captain Nilov, whom we called “the little\r\nadmiral”, once a commandant on the “Standard” and later at G.H.Q. with\r\nFather, had been arrested on order of Kerensky and shot without trial.\r\nThis because he said while at G.H.Q. that he would kill General Ruzsky.\r\nFortunately for Ruzsky, Captain Nilov was denied this pleasure. General\r\nRuzsky also had a cordial dislike for Captain Nilov because the latter\r\nknew that Ruzsky was a traitor.\r\n\r\nWe already by this time had begun to enjoy our fresh vegetables. We\r\nlingered and feasted our eyes on the beauty of nature which until now\r\nhad been taken for granted. Alexei, not yet thirteen, in the early\r\nsummer delighted in shedding his boots and wading into the sparkling\r\nwater up to his knees. It did not take much to satisfy him during these\r\ntrying times. He wished nothing more from those heartless men than to\r\nbe free to enjoy God’s given creation. How fortunate we human beings\r\nare, to see and feel all the loveliness and enjoy it to the utmost! How\r\ncruel too when men deny this privilege to their fellowmen!\r\n\r\nLater, when we were in Tobolsk, Alexei recalled the Children’s Island\r\nand wistfully expressed the hope that he might be able to return to it\r\nand wade in the water again. He spoke of his playrooms, his small cars,\r\nand then all of a sudden he seemed to realize that these reminiscences\r\nof former places, dear to his heart, caused only pain, and he never\r\nspoke of them again.\r\n\r\nMany days we saw curious strangers and friends being driven from the\r\nfence. The people, knowing the time of our walks, gathered along the\r\nfence; some even climbed on top of carriages to get a better view of\r\nus. Especially on Sundays, there were a great many watching us through\r\nthe railing.\r\n\r\nOften we saw familiar, friendly faces in the crowd, but we were afraid\r\nto recognize them. Once I thought I saw near the fence some of the\r\nTolstoys--Marie and Elizabeth, also Pasha and her brother. Mother in\r\nher youth had met from time to time some of the Tolstoy relatives who\r\nlived abroad. Another time we saw friends from Petrograd and some\r\nnurses from the Tsarskoe Selo hospitals.\r\n\r\nNear Easter my parents were informed that about eighty servants and\r\nworkers employed in the palace were to be discharged. My family was\r\nperturbed, because some servants had families who depended on their\r\nearnings, and many of them had been with my family from the time of\r\nFather’s marriage. Before these people, so close to us, left, both\r\nparents thanked them for their past services and each one of them\r\nwas presented with a gold or silver medal. Orders came that Count\r\nBenckendorff and all ladies in waiting, as well as Prince Dolgorukov,\r\nshould leave us. However, they were permitted to stay without\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nDuring Lent we were allowed to have services in our private chapel,\r\nbut Father Vassiliev had to eliminate Father’s name from the ritual.\r\nWith trembling voice he stopped in confusion when he came to the\r\npart in which he was supposed to say, “Long Life for the Imperial\r\nFamily.” I am sure that in his mind he added the omission to his own\r\nsatisfaction. When Father Vassiliev became ill, after much negotiating\r\nCount Fredericks, the Court Minister, received permission to have\r\nFather Belyayev, a deacon and four singers come to the palace during\r\nthe Easter holidays.\r\n\r\nPalm Sunday services had been held in the palace chapel on the ground\r\nfloor at the fourth entrance of the building. During the services we\r\nwere carefully watched. The guards were secreted behind the draperies\r\nand the altar. Father Belyayev seeing all this could not control his\r\nemotions; his tears fell freely down his vestment.\r\n\r\nDuring the Holy Week two services a day were the only refreshing\r\nmoments in our new lives. Mother stood behind a large screen made\r\nin her favorite purplish-blue crystal glass, which Father had given\r\nher previously. Behind the screen was a small, cushioned, kneeling\r\nstand, on top of which rested a Psalter. On the wall to the right,\r\nwere several religious paintings, inherited from her Mother Alice and\r\nseveral gifts from her Granny, Queen Victoria. The Psalter was searched\r\nwhen it was brought in and again when taken away. In the small room on\r\nMother’s right adjoining the chapel some Bibles were kept. Mother was\r\nvery much annoyed when a guard stood behind her throughout the service.\r\n“Even in this holy place,” she said, “one is deprived of a moment of\r\nmeditation.”\r\n\r\nOn the day of the Lord’s Crucifixion the revolutionists decided to bury\r\ntheir own dead. With the red flags flying and a band blaring forth\r\nwith the _Marseillaise_ and Chopin’s _Funeral March_, the procession\r\nadvanced through the avenues of lime trees and stopped opposite the\r\ncircular balcony from which we could see them marching. Among the dead\r\nthey paraded were bodies taken from the cemetery, including those who\r\ndied in the cellar, which they had set on fire during a drinking\r\nspree. But their evil scheme came to an end on this day, when angry,\r\nblack clouds darkened the sky, when a terrific hail and wind storm\r\nfuriously broke whole branches from the trees and pelted the metal roof\r\nof the palace with large hailstones. Candles were lit. When daylight\r\nreturned, the courtyard was flooded, and there were large cakes of ice\r\nin the water. All was quiet now.\r\n\r\nThe same screeching cry and the detested _Funeral March_ that should be\r\nreserved only for the dead was now heard every day. It became annoying\r\neven to the sentries. Often they whistled sarcastically as soon as the\r\ndemonstrators appeared. I even heard this abhorrent _March_ in my sleep.\r\n\r\nSaturday night the staff, the servants and others, several hundred in\r\nall, were present at the midnight service in our chapel, which lasted\r\ntill an early morning hour. The procession, headed by the priest who\r\ncarried an icon, went through the rooms with the lighted candles and\r\nthe message: “Khristos Voskrese (Christ is Risen)”, bringing the hope\r\nthat our dark lives might be brightened.\r\n\r\nWe thought it was a sad Easter, but a worse one was to follow. On this\r\nEaster morning the staff, the chief of the guards, the commandant,\r\nofficers, ladies in waiting and a few others assembled in Father’s\r\nlibrary to break the blessed bread. In the afternoon those on duty\r\nassembled in Mother’s room for congratulations.\r\n\r\nThis year our relatives, and high ranking military men, Ministers, and\r\nthe representatives of foreign countries no longer were permitted to\r\ncome to congratulate us on this Holy Day. Queen Olga of Greece, the\r\nsister of the Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich, miraculously\r\nentered the grounds but her entry into the palace was prevented. Her\r\nkind message and the Easter egg were delivered to us by an officer. A\r\ngreat many others came but were turned back at the gate.\r\n\r\nThere were several birthdays during our five months of imprisonment at\r\nTsarskoe Selo. First came my Father’s. On his birthday, services were\r\nheld in the chapel. The words “Long Life for the Tsar” were still\r\nmissing; a sad day. Then Mother’s, then came Tatiana’s, and on June\r\n5th, Russian calendar, I became sixteen years old--the year I should\r\nhave been officially presented to the Russian court. But there was no\r\ndebut for me and I did not care. The family did their best to make\r\nan occasion of it. A service was held in the chapel and I received\r\ncongratulations from all around me. A year earlier a design made by\r\nFabergé for my lavalier had been approved by my family, to be made of\r\ndiamonds and pearls. I was to receive it on this day. Instead, these\r\nsixteen diamonds and sixteen pearls, one for each birthday and one for\r\neach name day, were sewn into my clothes when we left for Siberia.\r\nNot long after my own birthday came Marie’s, and then just before our\r\ndeparture from Tsarskoe Selo came Alexei’s.\r\n\r\nMore about our imprisonment. First, there was some improvement in\r\nMother’s health. However, during the hot spell in July her heart\r\ncondition became worse. She was forced to lead a quiet life. There\r\nwere no more separations, no more hospital work and no attacks of\r\nhaemophilia for Alexei. We all fell into a routine. Lessons had been\r\nentirely neglected since our illness. Some of our instructors came from\r\noutside. They taught in the gymnasium and in other schools. Now it was\r\nno longer permissible for them to resume their former duties. Monsieur\r\nGilliard spent most of his time with Alexei, and in general was most\r\nhelpful in reorganizing the household with which the others were\r\ninexpert to cope.\r\n\r\nWe had books galore to choose from, and several pianos for our use. We\r\nresumed piano lessons--now with Anastasia Hendrikova; previously they\r\nwere given by Mr. Konrad. Father began to teach us history, geography\r\nand natural science; Mother, religion; Baroness Buxhoeveden, English;\r\nDr. Botkin, Russian; M. Gilliard, French; Mlle. Schneider, mathematics.\r\nThere was only one thing lacking--inspiration.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first Kerensky barged into Father’s rooms without\r\nwarning, much to the disgust of the Court Marshal who followed him\r\nangrily. Kerensky asked Father whether he would go to Germany if\r\nthe Kaiser would extend an invitation. Father disappointed him by\r\nanswering, “I shall never set foot on German soil. I have already\r\npreviously rejected the invitation.” A car supposed to carry us over\r\nthe border crashed into the fence as it tried to drive through the\r\ngate. Even if an opportunity had presented itself, dozens of strong\r\nchains that bound us to our Mother country would not let us leave\r\nRussia. There was an offer that we leave Russia by way of Murmansk, but\r\nKerensky betrayed it to the revolutionists, even though we would not\r\nhave accepted the offer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Kerensky wanted General Kornilov’s resignation but the General\r\nrefused to comply with his order. Kerensky then told Father that\r\nKornilov was a traitor. What was Kerensky? I wonder now if the General\r\nwas not in Kerensky’s way! Kerensky also was against Captain Count\r\nKotsebue, the Commandant of the Palace who formerly was an Uhlan Guard\r\nofficer. Kerensky forced him to give up his post in favor of Kerensky’s\r\ncommunist friend, Colonel Korovichenko.\r\n\r\nOnce after a walk when Father was about to enter the palace, one of\r\nthe new guards stepped in front of him and barred his entrance. Alexei\r\nfrom the open door saw what happened and burst out crying. Another\r\ntime Father was walking with Prince Dolgorukov in the park when one of\r\nthe new officers followed close behind and stepped on his heel. Father\r\nturned suddenly and hit the officer with his walking cane so hard that\r\nthe officer bent double. After that none of them tried this incivility\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nYears later I spoke by chance to a former Russian officer who said the\r\nEmperor should have “prayed less but worked more.” But this officer’s\r\nwife at that time remarked to her husband, “What kind of officer were\r\nyou? When you became ill with appendicitis you carried on like an\r\ninfant! Is that bravery?” My Father not only prayed and worked but\r\npossessed the bravery of a hero. Every day he spent ten to fourteen\r\nhours at his desk. There was no other man that worked and fought harder\r\nand with more determination than did Father. Such words were spoken\r\nonly by German traitors and weaklings who did everything to buy the\r\nprivilege to stay far behind the front lines. Some said that Father\r\nwas mild. Perhaps he was; he might have been appreciated in another\r\ncountry. However, many said that Father should have ordered guns, but\r\nthe Emperor would not take the lives of men. He was very kind because\r\nhe did not believe in the ruthlessness of Ivan the Terrible, or Lenin,\r\nTrotsky, Apfelbaum, Rosenfeld, Himmer, and others.\r\n\r\nThe very things we loved most, were now turning against us. Each\r\nmorning when I awakened I hoped for an improvement. But one glance\r\naround convinced me the times were not right. One day a bullet hit a\r\nwindow in Father’s study and left an ugly round scar, showing the great\r\nthickness of the glass. Our walks continued, but every time we went out\r\nwe discovered many familiar faces had disappeared, and were replaced\r\nby new ones. In the park the sentries followed us closely and engaged\r\nus in conversation. Most often we did not care to hear what they said.\r\nThen came an order limiting our walk to the first bridge of the brook.\r\nNow we were confined to a more restricted area. We tried to ignore the\r\nimpertinence of guards who lolled in our chairs on the lawn in front\r\nof the small balcony which led into the entry room. This balcony was a\r\nfew steps up and had an entrance on each side, but the arbitrary guards\r\nprevented us from entering except through one side only. Mother watched\r\nus from the window, and when we returned to her, one glance indicated\r\nthat she had been weeping. We knew it was the sight of our being so\r\nrestricted that made her cry. Whether long or short, these walks\r\nremained the most coveted events of our day. Mother too was wheeled out\r\nin her chair, and sat with her embroidery in the shade. Usually she was\r\nsurrounded by the young guards who asked her all kinds of questions,\r\nmostly religious ones. Those big children understood her and she won\r\nthem with her kindness.\r\n\r\nAt first our captivity at Tsarskoe Selo was not so difficult, even\r\nthough there was a complete lack of privacy and our freedom to come\r\nand go was restricted. In fact it was not much different from our\r\nusual routine as we had been accustomed to watchful eyes and many\r\nlimitations. We would have been fairly comfortable if we had had enough\r\nheat and the right food for the convalescents.\r\n\r\nThe familiar rooms, furnished with what we always considered to be\r\nour own possessions, were at once comforting and disturbing. But soon\r\nwe found out that these things and many personal household treasures\r\nno longer belonged to us. Many of these were confiscated immediately,\r\nincluding all Mother’s silver sets. Some of these were heirlooms from\r\nher Granny, Queen Victoria, and some were Father’s wedding gifts.\r\nOther confiscations included trays, platters, urns and numerous gold\r\nplates, gold tea glass holders and spoons, over five hundred table\r\nplace settings, Mother’s imperial jade figurines and crosses by Bolin,\r\nthe most famous jeweller in Petrograd; also many priceless gold icons\r\ndecorated with precious stones and other treasures.\r\n\r\nThey even took Alexei’s jade and rock crystal collection of animals,\r\ngold swords, miniatures of the family, and his icons, many of which\r\nwere presented to him during his illness in Spala in 1912 and were\r\nespecially esteemed by him, because the people had prayed before\r\nthem to spare his life. Some of these were in gold, studded in\r\nprecious stones. On his birth in 1904 the Shah of Persia ordered a\r\nreligio-historical rug to be made and had presented it to Alexei on\r\nhis twelfth birthday. Approximately 12 feet by 16 feet, it took twelve\r\nyears to make. As I remember it, it had Christ’s face in the middle,\r\nsurrounded by about a hundred world leaders from the time of Moses up\r\nto 1900. There was an excellent likeness of George Washington.\r\n\r\nOlga and Tatiana had saved some money with which they were able\r\nto redeem some of our tea sets, place settings and a few gold tea\r\nglass holders. Our home had the finest Persian rugs and Hepplewhite\r\nfurniture. The gallery contained fine paintings and rock crystal\r\nchandeliers.\r\n\r\nFather read in the paper that capital punishment had been abolished.\r\nHe knew this would mean disaster for Russia. He wrote a long letter\r\nto the Provisional Government and expressed his views, pointing out\r\nthe detrimental effect it would have on the Army and the country\r\nas a whole. Moreover, it would cause a great deal of danger to the\r\npublic--and so indeed it happened. He preferred death before such\r\nconditions should develop. He gave no thought to his own fate and that\r\nof his family. As a consequence of the abolition of the death penalty,\r\nKerensky was blamed openly for the murder of hundreds of young cadets\r\nand the torture of their superior officers. It was said that he was\r\nhand in glove with the perpetrators of these crimes. Many of these\r\nofficers were well known to us. We heard that many of them were bound,\r\nthen covered with straw saturated with kerosene, which was then set on\r\nfire before the eyes of their stricken families.\r\n\r\nKerensky was a good speaker and his words flowed smoothly. He seemed\r\nto impress people as being honest in his undertakings. This belief in\r\nhim eventually vanished. He spoke of freedom and many exciting ideals\r\npoured from his lips. He promised that when these ideals were put into\r\neffect they would bring a prosperous republic and a good fruit. But\r\nhis theory brought nothing but tragedy. Yet the seeds of the fruit\r\ncontinued to grow, and do so even now.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Kerensky’s absurd promises were constantly broken.\r\nMany came to regard him as a sheer opportunist. First, he told us that\r\nwe had an invitation to go to England. Later he contradicted himself\r\nby saying that the invitation had been cancelled. We were puzzled and\r\nstill we had to trust him. In the beginning Father believed that he was\r\nthe right man for the office. Soon people began to doubt Kerensky’s\r\nsincerity, but we could do nothing to repudiate him. All kinds of\r\nfantastic stories were germinating during Kerensky’s short-lived\r\nadministration which emerged rapidly but was soon carried away into a\r\nriver reddened with blood. Even his own friends whom he himself had\r\nliberated betrayed him.\r\n\r\nWith the air of a conqueror he went to General Headquarters, and the\r\npeople sarcastically said, “A Napoleon is now on the march. With a\r\nsnap of his fingers, he will sweep on to Berlin and secure the keys to\r\nthe city.” The new hero marched with thieves and murderers of Russia,\r\nand with these men he thought that he could win the war, and thus gain\r\npopularity. They carried the red flag and sang, “My poidyom vperyod i\r\nvyigrayem voinu s krasnym flagom--(We are marching forward and will win\r\nthe war with the red flag).”\r\n\r\nMany officers whom Kerensky had kept arrested, and who were anxious\r\nto fight the enemy, were left by this man to rot and die in unkempt\r\nprisons. He wanted to be the sole power and to keep all in his hands.\r\nAs a result Prince Lvov, Rodzianko (once his friend) and Generals\r\nAlexeiev and Kornilov, as well as many others, resigned their positions.\r\n\r\nKerensky moved into a section of the Catherine Palace, which once was\r\noccupied by Father’s A.D.C., and indulged in luxuries to gratify his\r\npalate. It was said that all kinds of vegetables and rare flowers were\r\nespecially raised for his pleasure, that he spared nothing to satisfy\r\nhis thirst for luxuries, and that he left terror and rivers of blood\r\nfor the Russian people to remember him by.\r\n\r\nMy little brother seemed to have faith in Kerensky and on one occasion\r\nhe asked him whether Father could legally abdicate for him too.\r\nKerensky replied, “Yes and no, but in your case I think, yes.” How\r\nsurprised Father was at this. Alexei must have been puzzled by the\r\nabdication and evidently, on thinking it over, he wanted an explanation\r\nby someone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI DEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illness we sisters had just gone through resulted in a partial loss\r\nof our hair. When Marie became half-bald our doctor suggested that we\r\nhave our heads shaved, which was done shortly before our departure for\r\nTobolsk. We four looked so much alike afterwards that we could not tell\r\nwho was who. Outdoors we wore turbans, especially when we were working\r\nin the vegetable garden which was beautiful and ready for our use.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Monday, July 31st, 1917, old style, Kerensky\r\npermitted Uncle Michael to come to the palace. Father was grateful for\r\nthis kind gesture on the part of Kerensky. At that time Uncle Michael\r\nhad already been placed under arrest. The visit had a painful effect.\r\nNo one of the family was allowed to see Uncle except Father. Kerensky\r\nand Colonel Kobylinsky had to be present during the visit which took\r\nplace in Father’s study. The meeting was distressing to Father and I\r\nam sure it was also to Uncle Michael. It was almost useless, because\r\nprivacy was denied to the brothers. Neither thought this was to be the\r\nlast time that they would see each other. Under the conditions the two\r\nbrothers were deprived of an opportunity to confide in each other.\r\nHowever, I remember Father saying that he would not have abdicated\r\nunder any circumstances had he known that Uncle Michael would also\r\nabdicate. It was said that the latter did so under pressure while being\r\nheld as a prisoner by the Provisional Government, for which Kerensky\r\nwas responsible. At this meeting Father asked about his mother and\r\nwas told by Uncle that it was impossible for him to see her. Father\r\nsaid: “Why not send Mr. Johnson (Uncle’s secretary) or contact General\r\nIvanov.” Father asked Uncle to have Kerensky arrange for us to go to\r\nthe Crimea. Granny was in the Crimea--for the first time since the\r\ndeath of her husband, Alexander III. Also our Aunt Xenia with her\r\nfamily and Aunt Olga with her new-born first child were there.\r\n\r\nAs Alexei’s thirteenth birthday had approached, we had trembled for\r\nfear that something might happen on that day. We somehow expected our\r\ndeparture, but not on such short notice. So many momentous incidents\r\nhad been connected with the number thirteen that we sisters were\r\nsuperstitious about that number. The three hundredth anniversary of\r\nthe Romanov dynasty was celebrated in 1913. On March 13th, 1917, Marie\r\nbecame deadly ill with measles and pneumonia. On Sunday, July 30th\r\n(August 12th), 1917 Alexei became thirteen years old. Misfortune struck\r\nus again. After the Te Deum in our chapel and congratulations for\r\nAlexei’s birthday, Count Benckendorff brought the news that we were to\r\nleave the next day. We still hoped it would be the Crimea. Because of\r\nAlexei’s birthday it was postponed to the following day. We all went\r\nabout as if nothing had happened, but in our hearts there was grief and\r\nfear. Alexei played on the little island and we went out and looked\r\nover the garden. We knew then that it was our last time in this beloved\r\nplace. If we must go, let’s go quickly.\r\n\r\nWe did not know our destination. Kerensky made a secret of it. He\r\nassured Father it would be a safer place, and that we should take with\r\nus plenty of warm clothing. Both parents were stoical. Evidently we\r\nwere not going to the Crimea. For weeks our trunks had been ready,\r\nbut now we each had been told to decide what additional, but only\r\nneeded, articles we wished to take with us. Mother said to leave\r\neverything undisturbed. I laid aside many things which finally had to\r\nbe abandoned. I felt like a traitor. At last, I finished sorting.\r\n\r\nI was determined to help pack my own suitcase for the first time. It\r\nwas no longer possible to take anything out of our vaults, treasures\r\ngiven Mother by Father and her family. A number of her precious icons\r\nwere wrapped carefully. She took only those given by proven, loyal\r\nfriends. We children also selected some from the corners of our\r\nbedrooms to take with us on this trip.\r\n\r\nIn spite of our intentions to travel lightly, trunk after trunk was\r\nfilled and sent downstairs. If we should ever reach England we wanted\r\nso much to have some of our things with us.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that any member of our household who so wished could go\r\nwith us, but anyone who did not intend to follow us should leave the\r\npalace immediately. A number of employees, not wanting to be separated\r\nfrom their families, had already left. Father preferred to take along\r\nonly those without family responsibilities. However, many servants\r\nleft their families behind and followed us into exile. No doubt, it\r\ntook courage to follow us, especially when our destination was not\r\nknown, yet we hated to leave so many behind whose loyalty we never\r\nquestioned. At the same time it was decided that the garden vegetables\r\nwould be used by those employees who stayed with us to the last. Count\r\nBenckendorff was to remain in the palace and care for Father’s private\r\nbusiness affairs.\r\n\r\nBefore we left Father reminded Count Benckendorff that he, through\r\nCount Rostovtsev, Mother’s secretary who was in charge of our private\r\nfortunes, and through Mr. Peter Bark, whose responsibilities related to\r\nfamily private interests abroad including insurance and investments,\r\nshould pay, respectively, all our bills at home and abroad. One of\r\nCount Benckendorff’s stepsons, Prince Valia Dolgorukov, was to go with\r\nus. We heard later that Kerensky went back to the palace, after taking\r\nus to the station, and ordered Count Benckendorff to leave our home at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nFather was given the choice of taking one of the generals with him. He\r\nselected General Tatishchev. This friend, who was independently rich,\r\nhad all the necessary qualities and was liked by everybody. The several\r\nhundred men who carried our baggage downstairs were rewarded. One of\r\nthem, a soldier, lifted his three-ruble note to his lips and kissed\r\nit. By the way his shoulders shook, we knew that he was crying. A few\r\nof our trunks were left upstairs and some were brought to Tobolsk much\r\nlater. We were allowed to take with us several dogs. I took my “Jemmy”\r\nwho had been given to me by Anna. Being small she did not require much\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nWe were now leaving our bedrooms, music room, class room, and\r\nplayrooms, where we had placed our dolls with their arms stretched out\r\nas if they were asking us not to leave them behind. Alexei tearfully\r\nplaced his Teddy bear against the door to guard his possessions. As we\r\nwandered through the rooms in lingering farewell, each tried not to see\r\nthe other. Those who were to stay behind cried and kissed us children\r\nevery time they saw us. These good-byes to our childhood home were\r\ndreadful. This ancestral home we were leaving was part of us. We gave\r\nit a reverential farewell. Marie and I went to our knees in the corner\r\nof our bedroom, set up with icons. Our eyes were fixed on the empty\r\nplaces from which some icons had been removed to go with us on this\r\ntrip.\r\n\r\nWe were nervous, full of anguish, and, in spite of our efforts to\r\nbe brave, we cried and we were reduced to sobs. Our good friend Dr.\r\nBotkin, who had been absent because of illness in his family, had just\r\nreturned. He gave us sisters drops of valerian to quiet our nerves.\r\nWhat went on in Father’s and Mother’s hearts only they knew. It was a\r\nqueer, heartrending feeling when we left our rooms not knowing of the\r\nfuture ahead.\r\n\r\nWe five children went down the private spiral stairway. As we did so,\r\nthe memory of my young years came back to me. I remembered when I\r\nhappily used to run up and down the steps trying to make two at a time.\r\nNow I could not see them; a handkerchief was pressed to my swollen\r\neyes. The stairs led us to Mother’s apartment. She had just finished a\r\nthanksgiving prayer when we appeared. We did not dare to look at her.\r\n\r\nNo doubt that to Father that home was full of Tsar-spirits, looking\r\ndown on him from portraits condemning this final surrender of\r\nautocracy. A life-sized portrait of Mother when she was young, happy,\r\nand beautiful hung in Father’s study--his favorite portrait. It was\r\nby Kaulbach, painted in 1903. He stopped and examined it as if he had\r\nnever seen it before.\r\n\r\nNo doubt in Mother’s mind were the words Aunt Ella said to her once:\r\n“Remember what happened to other Empresses!” Mother may also have\r\nthought of the painting of Marie Antoinette and her children by\r\nMme. Vigée-Lebrun, which was given to Mother by the President of\r\nFrance. Was she thinking now of a common misfortune? Or, possibly,\r\nshe thought of the words of the Emperor Joseph II, brother of Marie,\r\nwhen he prophesied to his pretty sister the coming disaster: “In very\r\ntruth, I tremble for your happiness; the revolution will be a cruel\r\none and perhaps of your own making.” But it was not the case with my\r\nMother: revolution was of the traitors’ making. I often ask myself,\r\nwhy was Mother so drawn to this unfortunate woman, who in character\r\nand education was so different from my Mother? At home in the glass\r\nwardrobe, were Olga’s and Tatiana’s christening gowns. They were copies\r\nof the dresses of Marie Antoinette’s children. In another case were\r\na few copies of the Queen’s own dresses, made for Mother in Lyons\r\nduring one of her early visits to France. We were all puzzled by the\r\nfascination Marie had for Mother, who was a student of history and had\r\nan aversion for its tragic pages.\r\n\r\nOur departure was scheduled for midnight, August 13th, new style.\r\nBefore the fateful hour arrived we were served tea. Midnight came\r\nbut no summons. Nevertheless, shortly after one in the morning, we\r\nassembled in the semicircular hall. Our personal luggage was standing\r\nat one side. Soon Count Benckendorff came with a message that General\r\nTatishchev had informed him that he was not allowed to come to the\r\npalace but would be at the station to meet us.\r\n\r\nBooks and magazines were brought to us. We could not read anything. My\r\nthoughts went back to the pages Mlle. Schneider had read to us while\r\nwe were recovering from our illness, and to the painting on the wall\r\nof Marie Antoinette in a large hat, sitting with her children and a\r\nwhite, long-haired dog at her feet. This large, gold-framed painting,\r\napproximately six feet high, dominated the room. Below it there was a\r\nsimple, inlaid console table and on the floor, on either side, stood\r\ntwo tall red French enamel vases. Somehow I had the idea that they had\r\nbeen a gift to the family from Cousin Wilhelm. From the time of the\r\noutbreak of the war, I had a strong impulse to break them.\r\n\r\nFather, who long before had read all the best known books on the\r\nFrench Revolution, asked for those volumes again when the reign of\r\nterror swept our country. My older sisters read them, too. Marie and\r\nI, because of our weakened eyes, went through only certain parts. No\r\ndoubt these traitors and the revolutionists had read them also, and\r\nfollowed the same pattern. Kerensky likewise was probably not ignorant\r\nof these events. There are so many similarities between the French and\r\nthe Russian Revolutions.\r\n\r\nNow the French Revolution stood full of meaning before me. During the\r\ncoronation festivities in France, when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette\r\nwere being crowned, a number of shocking disasters occurred. These were\r\nsimilar to the tragedy that occurred at the coronation of my parents.\r\nIn the former, when France’s economy declined and conditions were bad,\r\nonly 35 per cent of the land was held by the French peasants; the rest\r\nwas in the hands of the Church, the nobility and the crown. But Russia\r\neconomically was strong in spite of the war and the devastation of the\r\nwestern areas.\r\n\r\nWhen a daughter was born to the royal couple, Marie Antoinette had\r\neighty attendants at her service. History records that she was a gay\r\nwoman with demands for unlimited luxury and extravagance. It was also\r\nsaid that during the critical economic conditions in her country,\r\nshe had purchased an enormously expensive jewel for herself. They\r\ndiscovered much too late that this was not true.\r\n\r\nThe Russian people would not have believed that Father and Mother had\r\nbeen extravagant. As Father commented, when the revolution broke out 75\r\nto 80 per cent of Russian soil was in peasant hands. When one of the\r\nchildren in our family was born, we had only a few attendants. Besides,\r\nMother never cared for gaiety or luxury. During the war we repaired\r\nour own clothes and made our own beds. As Louis XVI was betrayed by\r\nMirabeau, so Father was betrayed by the Allies, with the help of the\r\nDuma and men like Kerensky, Ruzsky, Lenin, and Trotsky, and other\r\nforeign instigators. Many foreign elements gave aid and encouraged\r\nthe revolution in my country. As horrors occurred in France, so did\r\nthey in Russia. Marat asked for a quarter of a million lives, but\r\nTrotsky, Lenin, Apfelbaum and others of the clique demanded more than\r\nfifteen millions. Allegedly they all were guilty of something. Most of\r\nthe educated classes, millions of peasants, and forty thousand Greek\r\nOrthodox clergymen were killed.\r\n\r\nMany of the revolutionists were shipped to Russia for the purpose\r\nof inciting the plundering, robbing and strangling of Russia. They\r\nwere supported by the prisoners of war, mostly Austro-Hungarians and\r\nGermans. They were helped by a powerful branch of the Christian church,\r\nwho were apparently desirous of detaching our people from the Greek\r\nOrthodox Church. Fortunately the Russian people were and still are\r\nvery devoted to and proud of their own religion which they consider\r\nto be the true exponent of the Christian faith as delegated to us by\r\nthe Apostles and particularly by the Apostle Paul. (Read M. Pierre\r\nGilliard’s book, _Thirteen Years at the Russian Court_.)\r\n\r\nDistressed and restless we sat in this room, wondering if the same\r\nmisfortune that befell the court of Louis XVI was awaiting us. In one\r\ninstance to stimulate the revolution, the weapon was the jewel; in the\r\nother, Rasputin. We wondered whether the other courts of Europe and\r\nparticularly our own royal relatives were making any efforts to save\r\nRussia and ourselves.\r\n\r\nAt four in the morning we had tea again. As daybreak was pouring\r\nthrough the windows and the lights were turned off, breakfast was\r\nordered for 5:30. By mistake or by force of habit, the table for us\r\nfive children and the governess was set upstairs. This caused a furious\r\nconsternation and confusion around the watchful men. We were not\r\nallowed to go upstairs and we did not care to return there again.\r\n\r\nFinally an excited officer came running and announced to Count\r\nBenckendorff that he had talked with Kerensky who was on his way to us.\r\nThe room became full of people who waited interminably to say good-bye\r\nto us and to the staff who were to go with us. The sentries filled the\r\ndoorways, forming a long line on both sides to the waiting motors. We\r\nstrained our swollen eyes in the dawning light to see all we could as\r\nthe cars sped down the courtyard and through the garden’s side entrance.\r\n\r\nNear the fence there were some people who had been waiting all night\r\nto have a glimpse of their Emperor for the last time. They ran toward\r\nthis gate but were repulsed by the sentry. We saw the church with its\r\nblue dome, the double eagle and the golden cross, the little lake, the\r\npalace, the park, all for the last time. The iron gates, our prison\r\ngates, swung open and closed after us. Our hearts closed with them.\r\nThere were no bells ringing as we left our home, no cheering of the\r\nregiments of Cossacks who used to pass in brilliant parade before the\r\npalace. No convoy followed the Emperor on horses, dressed in tall caps\r\nand red and blue coats; and no yellow flag fluttered on the car. No\r\nflag caught the morning breeze on the roof top; it had been removed\r\nlong ago, even though Father and we were still there. The cars moved\r\nlike a funeral procession.\r\n\r\nEscorted by a detachment of cavalry, we arrived at the Alexander\r\nstation. The air was fresh. The golden sun flooded the sky. One hoped\r\nthat he could hear the words: “I shall light your way wherever you go.”\r\nWhat a change in the appearance of this charming and beautiful village\r\nhad taken place! The immaculate asphalt roads of Tsarskoe Selo I used\r\nto drive over only five months ago were no longer the same. I could see\r\nthe wound the new leaders had inflicted upon this peaceful village. It\r\nwas indeed a depressing and fearful sight.\r\n\r\nIn order to board the train, our automobiles stopped a short distance\r\nfrom our own white station, which was not far from the public one.\r\nApproaching it we saw in the distance a heap of luggage still being\r\nloaded into the train. With the troops guarding the vicinity, we walked\r\nalong and crossed the track. As we were to board the train, Mother gave\r\nher hand to Kerensky who kissed it and wished her a pleasant trip.\r\nThere was no stool to step on and Mother had trouble negotiating the\r\nhigh step. When she reached her compartment, she collapsed and fell\r\nbefore anyone could catch her, spraining her ankle and a finger, and\r\nstruggling to catch her breath. Dr. Botkin gave her a sedative. Partly\r\nbecause of the heat, it was several days before she recovered from the\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nIt was sad to leave our friends, especially those officers who stood\r\nat the station humbly with their caps in their hand, and their heads\r\nbowed for the last time--their final reverence to Russia. The family\r\nstood near the windows in two different cars and blessed those good\r\nmen, when suddenly several of them entered the car, and wanted to fall\r\non their knees before Father, but he would not let them do so. Instead,\r\nhe embraced them, their faces resting on his shoulder. This great man\r\nthanked his loyal officers (especially two men, Kushelev, and another\r\nwhose name I do not remember but which was something like Artasalev)\r\nfor their services with the words, “Be loyal and help your country;\r\nthey need you now more than ever.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, they withdrew, and Father touched his own insignia\r\nof command, promoting them to a higher rank for the last time. This\r\ntouching scene made him withdraw from the window so that they might not\r\nsee the tears in his eyes. Suddenly on order of Commissar Kozmin, all\r\nthe shades of the car were drawn.\r\n\r\nAlready within the confines of these quarters, Father’s spiritual\r\nagony was supreme. He knew that he had abdicated not for selfish\r\nreasons, but to avoid the bloodshed which he foresaw, but which the\r\nothers did not. Now, this suffering family carried with them into\r\nuncertainty the centuries-old secrets of the dynasty.\r\n\r\nWith a quick jerk and screech the wagons-lits began to move. The\r\nvibration sent shivers to our souls. It was 6:30 A.M. We hoped the\r\ntrain would be heading for the west or south. However, it was not long\r\nbefore we realized much to our disappointment that we were heading\r\neastward.\r\n\r\nFather once promised us that as soon as the war was over, he would\r\ntake us to visit the Siberian cities. It was now evident that Father’s\r\npromise to us of a Siberian trip was being fulfilled without advance\r\nknowledge or planning. Later when Kerensky was being accused by the\r\npeople for sending us to Siberia, he did not have the courage to admit\r\nit, but instead cowardly tried to lay the blame on my Mother by saying\r\nthat it was her wish to have the family go to Siberia. The truth is\r\nhowever that when it became evident that we were being sent to Siberia,\r\nMother remarked, “Of all places, how could he think of Siberia?”\r\n\r\nJust before our departure from Tsarskoe Selo, Father made each of us\r\nsign our names on slips of papers, put them in separate envelopes and\r\nleave them in our rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight outside but inside, with shades drawn and lights\r\nglaring, it might as well have been night. We were all terribly tired\r\nand we sat quietly for some time before having our breakfast. No one\r\nknew what the other was thinking. Our hearts were heavy and there were\r\ntears. Mother gathered us with her eyes. “We are together,” she said.\r\n“You are my wealth and I am rewarded by the Lord for giving me such a\r\ngood family.”\r\n\r\nOur train consisted of four or five cars. One car was occupied by us.\r\nIn the next car were Prince Vasily Dolgorukov, General Tatishchev,\r\nMlle. Schneider, Countess Hendrikova, Dr. Botkin, M. Gilliard,\r\nand Colonel Kobylinsky. In addition there were Commissar Makarov,\r\nVershchinin, and another person whose name escapes me.\r\n\r\nThe other cars were occupied by our household staff and the guard.\r\nWe were grateful to them all for staying with us, grateful too that\r\nKerensky had allowed Colonel Kobylinsky and Commissar Makarov to\r\naccompany us.\r\n\r\nCoffee was served to us; it helped lift our spirits. We hardly moved\r\nexcept to go to the dining car for our meals. Mother and Alexei were\r\nserved theirs in their own compartments. It was very hot, dry, and\r\ndusty, especially before we reached Asiatic Russia. The train made\r\na number of stops to take water, usually a short distance from the\r\nstations. All the time we were closely watched and guarded by the\r\nsharpshooters commanded by Colonel Kobylinsky. It was a grim ride, but\r\nKerensky had made Father believe we were headed for a much safer place.\r\n\r\nOn the third day we passed the city of Perm and followed a river. The\r\nview was picturesque, a typically Russian scene. We felt the change\r\nof air as we crossed from European to Asiatic Russia, through the\r\nUral Mountains. The train reduced its speed. Luckily for Mother, the\r\nair became cooler, otherwise she might have had heart failure. We\r\npassed through Ekaterinburg with its two stations one on each side of\r\nthe city. No one would have believed then that eleven months later,\r\nthis Siberian city would become the scene of one of the world’s most\r\natrocious crimes about which many volumes would be written.\r\n\r\nSeveral times along the way and between stations the train would stop,\r\nonce for one full hour, which gave us an opportunity to take a walk\r\nalong the tracks under the watchful eyes of our guard. This gave us\r\nsisters a chance to pick violas along the track.\r\n\r\nFather had been in Siberia in 1890-1891. Consequently, he knew Siberia\r\nwell, not only the cities, but the locations of different industries\r\nand the mining regions, which he had visited during his travels. He\r\npointed to us locations of the most important industries, such as the\r\niron works, paper mills, and gold and copper mines. He was sent to\r\nSiberia by his father, Alexander III, with the engineers at the head of\r\nthe committee for the construction of the railroads connecting European\r\nRussia with the shores of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nWhen he ascended the throne he continued the work entrusted to him by\r\nhis father, to complete this construction. The Amur line was finished\r\nin March 1915 exactly two years before the revolution. He told us that\r\nthe first stone for the Ussuri line was laid in Vladivostok in 1891,\r\nupon his return from the Far East. Several uncles also had been in the\r\nFar North of Siberia. The University of Tomsk was inaugurated during\r\nthe reign of my Grandfather, Alexander III. Father gave to the museum\r\nof Ekaterinburg part of its famous Numismatic Department, with its rare\r\ncoin collection. He also gave large contributions to the Ural mining\r\nschool in Ekaterinburg. The Ural Society for Natural Sciences was under\r\nthe patronage of my Uncle, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The\r\nImperial stone cutting works and the gold melting department which were\r\nalso in Ekaterinburg belonged to the Imperial family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marie Feodorovna 1914\r\n\r\nTHE DOWAGER EMPRESS MARIE FEODOROVNA--1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR NICHOLAS II]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aleksandra.\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS ALEXANDRA FEODOROVNA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TSESAREVICH ALEXEI--MOGILEV--1916]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND DUKE MICHAEL ALEXANDROVICH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND DUCHESS ELIZABETH FEODOROVNA]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND DUCHESSES ANASTASIA, MARIE AND\r\nTATIANA--TSARSKOE SELO--1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NICHOLAS II AND HIS CHILDREN (l. to r.): THE GRAND\r\nDUCHESSES ANASTASIA, OLGA, TATIANA AND MARIE AND THE TSESAREVICH\r\nALEXEI, WITH A CONVOY OF CAUCASIAN OFFICERS--_ca._ 1916]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TSESAREVICH ALEXEI AND HIS SISTERS, THE GRAND\r\nDUCHESSES OLGA, ANASTASIA AND TATIANA--TSARSKOE SELO--1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GRAND DUCHESSES MARIE, OLGA, ANASTASIA AND\r\nTATIANA--TSARSKOE SELO--1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Courtesy The P.

Speller, Jr._\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND DUCHESS ANASTASIA--ILLINOIS--1963]\r\n\r\nThe Alexander house for the poor and other civic institutions\r\nwere built in their entirety from funds of Alexander III. Some of\r\nour friends had some industries in these regions, namely Count\r\nVorontsov-Dashkov, Countess Stenbock-Fermor, General Tatishchev, Prince\r\nDolgorukov, Count Ignatiev, Prince Demidov, Baroness Meller-Zakomelsky,\r\nCount Muraviev-Amursky, Count Stroganov, and others. All these names\r\nwere familiar to us. General Count Tatishchev, who was with us on the\r\ntrain, gave us many historical facts about Ekaterinburg. His ancestors\r\nhad built this city in honor of the Empress Catherine the Great.\r\n\r\nEkaterinburg is the junction of various railroads, connecting the\r\nSiberian main line via Perm with Tiumen and Cheliabinsk and other\r\nside lines. On Father’s wedding date November 14th, 1894, old style,\r\na library and free reading room was given by him; and every year\r\nthereafter, whole sets of books were sent to Cheliabinsk on this\r\nday. He described to us the tea packaging business at Kiakhta in the\r\nTransbaikal, from where many of our grey horses came.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Tiumen we saw feeding stations, medical shelters and\r\nrailroad car churches and portable schools. They were built for the\r\nconvenience of the settlers. Practically in every city was a school or\r\na hospital built from the funds of my Grandfather.\r\n\r\nWe kept climbing higher and in the morning we stopped near the town of\r\nBazhenovo. Some peasants who saw us wanted to come close to us, but\r\nwere sent back by the guards. They told the men that the distilleries,\r\nwhich had been closed during the war, were reopened and the people were\r\nbecoming intoxicated on the spirits and wines produced there. They\r\nalso said that the emerald mines already had been closed and that the\r\nworkers were spending their time in the wine cellars getting drunk.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth midnight our train arrived in Tiumen where we were to\r\ntake a boat to Tobolsk. While our trunks and other heavy boxes were\r\nbeing loaded on the boat, we walked for several hours through the\r\ndimly-lighted street near the dock in the cool Siberian air and crossed\r\nthe three railroad tracks to the boat. In the distance and around the\r\nbend of the river we could see the flickering lights of the city of\r\nTiumen.\r\n\r\nWe boarded the small, two-decker steamer “Rossia.” Father and his\r\nfriends stayed on the deck until morning. We sisters got up early to\r\nget a view of the city in the distance, but the boat was already on\r\nits way, escorted by two smaller vessels, “Kormilets” and “Sibiriak.”\r\nWe passed many small rivers, and swamps and lakes, parts of which were\r\ncovered with reeds and millions of red flowers. Mother called them\r\nsaltwort. We saw some red foxes and white partridges, and on a swamp\r\nthere was a singing swan. We saw many beautiful birds, some familiar to\r\nus and some not.\r\n\r\nFather said Godunov, Volynsky and Prince Bariatinsky contributed a\r\ngreat deal to the progress of Tiumen. Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich founded\r\nTiumen in 1664 and visited this frozen land himself. Alexander II\r\nconstructed hospitals and later Father sponsored shelters, feeding\r\nplaces and medical centers for the exiles on their way to the\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of exiles in Siberia, the first exiles to Tobolsk Government\r\nbegan at the time of the murder of Tsarevich Dimitri in 1591. Two\r\nRomanov brothers, Ivan and Vasili Nikitich Yuriev-Zakharin, and\r\nPrince Beloselsky were banished in 1601 by Tsar Boris Godunov. Later\r\neven Sheremetiev and Prince Dolgorukov were exiled to Tiumen and\r\nTobolsk. The descendants of those old families were close friends.\r\nAnother coincidence: the first Romanov was to visit Siberia and the\r\nlast Romanov was to die in Siberia. The people believed that Ivan the\r\nTerrible was responsible for the establishment of the prisons here.\r\nHowever, vicious propaganda tried to make the people believe that it\r\nwas Father who had established these prison camps. This was nothing\r\nmore than an unadulterated Bolshevik lie.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon we came to the juncture of the Tobol and the\r\nTura Rivers. We passed the village of Pokrovskoe where on a high\r\nbank overlooking the Tobol stood Rasputin’s house. Soon the Irtysh\r\nRiver met the Tobol, and we continued on the Irtysh, which by now had\r\nbecome wider. On the second day, late in the afternoon we arrived\r\nin front of Tobolsk. This city seemed to be built on two levels of\r\na hill, one above the other. Near the upper level of the town was\r\na stone wall. We were told that this wall was a fortress and was\r\nbuilt in the 16th century in order to protect the new colonies from\r\ninvasion by plundering Kirghiz, Kazak and Kalmuk tribes. There were\r\nlots of people at the wharf; apparently they had heard of our coming.\r\nDr. Botkin, Colonel Kobylinsky and Commissar Makarov went to see the\r\nGovernor’s house, where we were to stay, and they found that the house\r\nwas being redecorated and was not yet ready for occupancy, so we\r\ncontinued to live on the boat for a number of days. They also found\r\nthat the furniture was inadequate and the beds were not suitable for\r\nour parents. They took it upon themselves to find beds. Later Makarov\r\npurchased even a piano, using a part of his own money for this purpose.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the steamer made little trips on the river. Several\r\ntimes we went ashore for a walk and once to the monastery of Abalak,\r\naround the bend where the Irtysh and the Tobol Rivers met.\r\n\r\nA carriage from the monastery was provided for Mother’s use, but the\r\nrest of us preferred to walk the narrow road up the hill, under a\r\nstrong guard. The monastery stood amidst lovely grounds on a hill\r\nnot far from the landing place. There were people on one side at the\r\nmonastery church, who began to cry when they saw us. We prayed before\r\nthe miraculous Image of the Holy Virgin with her hands raised from her\r\nelbows and the Christ Child resting in the folds of her robe. Her\r\nheadgear was studded with pearls.\r\n\r\nThis Image of the Holy Virgin later was brought to Tobolsk. Peace\r\nand contentment we found in our undisturbed prayers, in this Holy\r\nsanctuary. Our hearts were strengthened, and it gave us a new hope\r\nand courage. The iconostas, with many Byzantine icons, was much more\r\nbeautiful than the one in Tsarskoe Selo. We had often heard of this\r\nmonastery and now we had the opportunity to see it. We were grateful to\r\nColonel Kobylinsky and Commissar Makarov for allowing us this kind of\r\nprivilege. We never forgot this gracious gesture.\r\n\r\nAt night the boat anchored in the middle of the river in front of\r\nTobolsk.\r\n\r\nAt last the house was ready. Mother, Alexei and Marie were driven to\r\nthe house, while Father and the rest of us walked along the Tulyatskaya\r\nstreet to the house. I think that was the street leading from the\r\ndock. Later, Marie told us that, when Mother passed near the Lutheran\r\nchurch, her eyes filled with tears. She said: “It reminds me of the\r\nday after your Grandfather’s death. I was baptised in the old chapel\r\nin Oreanda in the Crimea.” It was the day she was converted to the\r\nRussian Orthodox Church and given the name of Alexandra Feodorovna with\r\nthe title of Grand Duchess of Russia and the style of Her Imperial\r\nHighness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV Tobolsk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII ORIENTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI had pictured the house in the midst of woods, but when I saw it\r\nsurrounded by a high wooden fence still being erected, it gave me a\r\nfeeling of loneliness and fear. When we crossed the noisy, wornout\r\nwooden sidewalk and the gate closed behind us, we were prisoners.\r\nParadoxically the name of the street was Svoboda (Freedom).\r\n\r\nWith us came the following: Our faithful friend General Ilia\r\nTatishchev, General Valia Dolgorukov, Dr. Eugene Botkin, M. Pierre\r\nGilliard, Countess Anastasia Hendrikova and Mlle. Ekaterina Schneider;\r\nalso Miss Alexandra Tegleva, a nurse and her assistant, Elizabeth\r\nErsberg, and the chambermaids, Miss Tutelberg and Anna Demidova;\r\nFather’s servant, Terenty Chemodurov; Mother’s servant, Alexei Volkov;\r\nand Ivan Sidniev, the servant of us four sisters. Also there were\r\nour brother’s personal attendants, Trup, Ivanov and Markov, and his\r\nmale nurse, Klementy Nagorny; a writer, a hairdresser; several cooks\r\nincluding Kharitonov and his helper, Leonid Sidniev; and other help.\r\nAbout forty people came with us. Later came Mr. Sidney Gibbs, our\r\nEnglish tutor, and Dr. Derevenko, who were permitted to join us and\r\nresume their duties. Still later Baroness Buxhoeveden, a lady in\r\nwaiting, followed, joining us on the boat on the day we were leaving\r\nfor Ekaterinburg. This does not include the military personnel, which\r\nnumbered about 300-400.\r\n\r\nThe house itself was quite nice. Our quarters on the second floor were\r\nsmaller and more crowded than those we were accustomed to. We occupied\r\nthree bedrooms: one for my parents, one for Alexei, and the other for\r\nus four girls. On this floor there was a big hall with a piano and\r\na comfortable divan, tables and other pieces of furniture. Next to\r\nAlexei’s room was a room for his male nurse. Father’s study was in a\r\ncorner room at the head of the stairway. We also had a balcony which we\r\nfound extremely pleasant when the sun was out. From it Mother watched\r\nus when we went for a walk in the small yard. Often we went out on the\r\nbalcony to see the sunset and the view of the cathedral and the low\r\nmountains in the background. It was beautiful; the sun seemed so much\r\nbrighter than in Petrograd or Tsarskoe Selo.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the first floor were the same as on the second.\r\nThe rooms opened on both sides of a long corridor which ran from the\r\nfront to the back of the house. The closest room to the vestibule\r\nwas occupied by an orderly officer on duty. M. Gilliard’s room and\r\nthe dining room were on this floor, as were the remaining quarters\r\nused by our household. But later the larger rooms had to be divided\r\nby partitions to make two rooms out of one, in order to accommodate\r\neveryone possible. Almost all the rooms had parquet floors, and on the\r\nsecond floor we had some of our fine Persian scatter rugs and others,\r\nall sent to us from Tsarskoe Selo by Makarov. Most of the remainder\r\nof the staff was housed across the street in the large residence\r\nwhich belonged to a rich merchant named Kornilov. Extra maids had\r\naccommodations in town.\r\n\r\nOur walks were not exciting, because of the limited space, which\r\nconsisted of a small garden, where there were some Siberian irises, and\r\na part of the street and a part of a square joined to the garden by a\r\nhigh wooden fence. This space was always guarded by a dozen or more\r\nsoldiers on the outside and by that many more inside. In the back of\r\nthe house there were the temporary barracks built to accommodate the\r\nguards. From here they could observe all our activities. We played ball\r\nor tug of war among ourselves; and occasionally other games with the\r\nguards. Father was always present at these games.\r\n\r\nWe began to feel almost natural in our prison house. The small quarters\r\ntook the form of a home and we settled down into a peaceful routine.\r\nFrom the absence of shooting and rioting, it was evident the revolution\r\nhad not reached this part of the country. In fact, everything was so\r\nquiet it was hard to believe it could be Russia.\r\n\r\nOne of Father’s complaints was the lack of news. We were completely\r\nisolated. We did receive a locally published newspaper containing\r\nmostly hearsay. No first hand information freshened its pages, nor did\r\nit contain any foreign news.\r\n\r\nNow and then Commissar Makarov and the guards inadvertently dropped\r\nsome news. Our friends from across the street were at liberty to enter\r\nthe governor’s house and resume their duties. They even were permitted\r\nto see the town, but we could not go out. Thanks to Colonel Kobylinsky,\r\nour first two months at Tobolsk were quite pleasant. The house came\r\nnear to being the kind of home that Mother had always longed for--one\r\nin which we could be close to each other. No external duties claimed\r\nany of us, not even Father--a situation that made him restless.\r\n\r\nThere were many guards everywhere, but they, like Colonel Kobylinsky,\r\nhad come with us from Tsarskoe Selo and knew us as submissive\r\nprisoners. They became our friends and we chatted with them freely. The\r\ncolonel was very kind; Father nicknamed him “our friend.” There was no\r\nfriction because we complied with every demand. They trusted us but\r\nstill they watched us as they were ordered to do.\r\n\r\nOur food was simple but nourishing. Our own chef, Kharitonov, and his\r\nhelper cooked to our satisfaction. In living this simple life, Mother\r\nbecame much stronger. She ceased to fret over the wounded soldiers,\r\nwhom she could no longer help, and she found compensation in her\r\nwriting, painting and religion and in our close family life. At least,\r\nwe were all under the same roof. She had her one wish: the right for us\r\nto belong to each other. Our being together went a long way to soften\r\nour captivity.\r\n\r\nAt first it was very difficult for Mother to adjust herself to the new\r\nexperience of housekeeping, managing personally and coming in direct\r\ncontact with the attendants. The sudden change from many servants to a\r\nfew was very confusing to her. She had not kept house for some years;\r\neven while living with her Granny she had devoted her time to her\r\nstudies. Since these servants had to assume duties which were strange\r\nto them, we sisters helped Anna and Tootles in their daily work.\r\nOperations were not always smooth but the servants were willing and\r\nadaptable and above all loyal. After a while Colonel Kobylinsky gave\r\npermission for several maids from Tsarskoe Selo, who were willing to\r\ncome, to join us. But the sudden changes in Tobolsk kept them waiting\r\nthere for weeks and in the end they never were able to enter the house.\r\n\r\nAt this time we had a few letters from different friends but nothing\r\nfrom our relatives in the Crimea. The latter were constantly in our\r\nminds and we wished so much to be near them in that beautiful country,\r\namong all those flowers and near the blue-green sea. Then, as if by\r\nmental telepathy, Colonel Kobylinsky arrived, his pale face beaming\r\nwith excitement, and handed a letter to Father from Aunt Xenia in the\r\nCrimea. It calmed us, but at the same time left in our hearts a painful\r\nand lonely feeling which stayed with us incessantly. Later a number of\r\nletters came from that distant land. One such letter took six months\r\nto arrive. Father wrote short letters as there was always the fear of\r\nbringing trouble to the recipients.\r\n\r\nWhen shortly our English tutor, Sidney Gibbs, arrived in Tobolsk, he\r\nbrought us first hand information on the happenings in the Crimea and\r\nthe conditions in Tsarskoe Selo and Petrograd.\r\n\r\nThe older men who came with us from Tsarskoe Selo, especially of the\r\nFirst and the Fourth regiments became our friends. They were kind to us\r\nand could not understand why we were held prisoners. These men loved\r\nAlexei, and to them he still was their Tsarevich. Those good fellows\r\nbrought him gifts, which they proudly presented to him with loving\r\nsmiles and touching words. I will never forget the time when one of\r\nthese men spent many evenings carving a puzzle out of white soft wood.\r\nIt was chain-like and every turn made gave it a new design. Another man\r\nmade for him a set of wooden Kalmuk toys, from the great-grandfather\r\nto the tiniest baby boy. They fitted into each other so skilfully that\r\nwhen all together they formed only one big great-grandfather. Alexei\r\nwas touched by these gifts. We knew all these men and the families of\r\nsome of them. Knowing their financial condition, we felt sorry for them.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the Second regiment, who at first were unpleasant, had\r\nby now become actually insolent. They formed a Soldiers Committee under\r\nthe direction of a man called Arnold Goldstein who came to Tobolsk\r\nabout a month after our arrival and at once started to poison those\r\nmen. All other individuals who came to Tobolsk were at once arrested\r\nbut this man was allowed to stay and make trouble. The committee\r\nasserted its authority over the officers whom Kerensky had sent when\r\nwe first arrived in Tobolsk. The friendly spirit that prevailed in our\r\nprison was reported. Stern orders bounced back. Our kindly guards had\r\nto step aside, and radical ones took their places. Colonel Kobylinsky\r\ntried to resist but, alas, it was a losing fight.\r\n\r\nShortly after we reached Tobolsk, the young townspeople had a dance\r\non the street, called “Krugom.” The girls were dressed in handsome\r\nembroidered red babushkas and the boys in high boots and pleated\r\ntrousers. The dance starts when one of the girls calls her boy friend\r\nby his name, saying please come. He takes off his fur cap and the\r\ncouple dance in the middle of the circle while the balalaika and\r\naccordion play and the participants sing a song--the words of which\r\nusually center on water, birds, the moon, etc., all taken from nature.\r\nThe boy then kisses this girl, the girl of his heart, and asks her to\r\ndance with him. The girl then calls another man who in turn invites his\r\nown girl. The first couple drops out and the procedure is repeated.\r\n\r\nFather liked the Siberian climate and the fabulous splendors of the\r\nsunrise and sunset over the mountains and the soft clouds hiding\r\nthe distant hills. We too found it agreeable and peaceful after the\r\nturbulent months we had just gone through. But these tranquil few\r\nweeks came to an end all too soon. We shortly learned that one of our\r\nformer ladies in waiting, Mlle. Rita Khitrovo was in Tobolsk. Her\r\nunannounced arrival caused us a great deal of apprehension. We felt\r\nthat our Russian teacher, Mlle. Bittner, in whom Colonel Kobylinsky was\r\ninterested, might find an opportunity to exaggerate the reasons for\r\nMlle. Khitrovo’s presence in Tobolsk and thereby create an incident\r\nwhich would have serious repercussions. Once Mlle. Khitrovo was seen\r\ntalking to a member of our staff across the street, and making a cross\r\nwith her hand toward the balcony on which we were standing. Immediately\r\nafter that she was arrested and sent away. The letters she had brought\r\nwith her were seized and were not delivered to their owners until after\r\nthey had been censored. Following this incident Kerensky ordered that\r\nall persons coming to Tobolsk must be registered.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this incident Commissar Makarov who knew of Khitrovo’s\r\ncoming was relieved of his post and replaced by Commissar Pankratov and\r\nhis deputy, Nikolsky. Pankratov, despite his prison record, was kind\r\nto us. His knowledge of languages and his taste for art and literature\r\nbetrayed his cultural background. This middle-aged man often used to\r\ntell us sisters about his experiences in prison. Yet never once did\r\nhe complain. Instead he admitted his guilt. He was a man of fifty\r\nwith dark hair. He made a notation on every letter received and often\r\ndelivered our mail, most of which was addressed to him, saying that he\r\nwas glad that our friends had not forgotten us. Once he told Marie that\r\nno harm would come to us while he was there.\r\n\r\nNikolsky was a Pole of disreputable background. He was rude and fanatic\r\nand had an uncontrollable temper and hatred. He immediately ordered\r\neveryone to have his picture taken and to carry a card showing the\r\nname, age and day of birth, because he had had to have his picture\r\ntaken and carry a card while serving a prison term for killing two men.\r\n\r\nOur schedule for the week was made up by Olga and M. Gilliard. Our\r\nfriends were the only gleam of light in our daily life. To change the\r\natmosphere it was decided to stage some plays in which the staff and\r\nwe children could take part. A stage was put up in the big hall on\r\nthe second floor, which also served us as a school room and later as\r\na chapel. All our friends from across the street were asked to these\r\nperformances to share in this diversion. Olga was in charge of the\r\nmusic, if such was needed. Alexei was not very keen about taking part\r\nin the plays and often begged for someone else to take his role. There\r\nwas always an officer present at these performances. But soon rapidly\r\nchanging conditions no longer permitted us these recreations.\r\n\r\nOur day began at eight in the morning with breakfast served to us and\r\nour friends in the dining room downstairs. It consisted of tea or weak\r\ncoffee. Olga had hers with Father in his study, and Alexei his with\r\nMother. At 9:00 A.M. we younger sisters took our lessons in the big\r\nhall, but during the cold spell, before the house warmed up we started\r\nthe first lesson in bed with Mother. We wore in the house our woolen\r\nleggings or boots and were bundled in warm cardigans. Our instructors\r\nwere M. Gilliard, Mlle. Hendrikova, Mlle. Bittner, once a teacher at\r\nthe gymnasium in Tsarskoe Selo. Father continued with the history and\r\ngeography lessons. The classes lasted from 9:00-11:00 A.M. Alexei had\r\nhis lessons in M. Gilliard’s or his own room. Afterwards we went out\r\ninto the yard for a half hour’s exercise before our luncheon at 1:00\r\nP.M.\r\n\r\nFather and Olga ate luncheon with us in the dining room. Mother and\r\nAlexei had theirs upstairs. Our luncheon consisted of soup, meat or\r\nfish and sweets. From two to four we went out again and helped saw wood\r\nbehind the greenhouse. Mother seldom went out with us in the morning.\r\nAlexei joined us in the afternoon after his rest and, when the weather\r\npermitted, Mother sat in a chair in the sun, sewing, knitting, writing\r\nor painting. When indisposed she stayed upstairs. Sometimes she played\r\nthe piano and sang, mostly religious pieces. From 3:45 to 4:00 there\r\nwas a short break for tea, for the family only, during which Mother\r\npoured the tea herself. The lessons started again at 4:00 and lasted\r\nuntil 6:00 or 7:00 P.M. Dinner was served at eight; the menu was the\r\nsame as that served at luncheon except that we had no dessert. Mother\r\nalways was present at these meals. After dinner, coffee was served\r\nupstairs. While Father poured, all stood up except Mother. We could not\r\nhelp noticing that usually there were thirteen persons at the dinner\r\ntable, seven from the family, and six from the staff. Occasionally Dr.\r\nDerevenko and his son were asked to dinner, also Colonel Kobylinsky and\r\nMlle. Bittner.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few weeks the food was satisfactory; this did not last\r\nlong because many products became scarce and prices went sky high.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to raise our own food. Within a month we had many\r\nchickens, turkeys, and ducks that enjoyed swimming in their little pond\r\nwhich we had made by diverting a small portion of a brook which ran\r\nthrough the garden. The horse stable was used for pigs and even the\r\ngreenhouse was converted into a chicken coop.\r\n\r\nSoon the people learned of the hour of our walks. They tried to get a\r\nbetter view of us through the cracks between the boards, and many of\r\nthem kneeled down in prayer for us. Even Kalmuks who are Mohammedans\r\nraised their hands and prayed to Allah for us, without being afraid to\r\ndo so. To many millions, the Emperor and Empress were still the Father\r\nand Mother of Russia.\r\n\r\nIn October before navigation on the river stopped for the winter, and\r\nafter his enforced return to Tsarskoe Selo, our friend Makarov sent\r\nus from there some warm clothes and rugs, curtains, linens and other\r\nneeded items as well as some provisions.\r\n\r\nDuring Kobylinsky’s administration we were permitted to go to church\r\non Sundays and holidays. The church services were held at 8:00 A.M.\r\nwhen it was still dark. We assembled in the yard and proceeded to\r\nthe church flanked on each side by sentries. The church was a short\r\ndistance from the house and in getting there we had to cross the\r\nstreet, pass through a small park and onto another street. Father went\r\ninto the church first, followed by Mother, Alexei and then us sisters.\r\nSome of the guards entered the church and stood behind us while the\r\nothers remained outside, waiting near the steps. On our return, after\r\nthe service and as a mark of honor, the church bells kept ringing until\r\nwe entered the house. This procedure however was changed by Nikolsky\r\nwho, in a childish show of authority, ordered that the ringing of the\r\nbells be stopped before we reached the gate. Church services for us\r\nwere strictly private and the public was not permitted to participate\r\nin the services while we were there. Instead they waited outside, and\r\nas we left the church they kneeled and kissed the ground after we\r\npassed as a sign of their love for the family.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Derevenko came to Tobolsk with his son Kolia, it was a joy for\r\nAlexei. The two boys played together, read and wrote little stories.\r\nAlexei was happy to have a friend to play and eat with. But this did\r\nnot last very long. One day Nagorny carried a letter from Alexei to his\r\nfriend Kolia. It was nothing more than childish play. Nikolsky searched\r\nNagorny and found the letter. He immediately went to Pankratov with\r\nit, saying, “You see how easily they can smuggle letters out and who\r\nknows what else?” Kolia was forbidden to come into the house, and only\r\noccasionally were they permitted to play outdoors under the watchful\r\neyes of the guards, provided they kept at a distance from each other.\r\n\r\nFor weeks Mother had been suffering from neuralgia. Now her teeth\r\ncaused her a great deal of pain. Everyday she waited patiently for her\r\ndentist, who was to come all the way from the Crimea. I never knew of\r\nanyone who suffered so much and still had so much patience and never\r\ncomplained. On the arrival of Dr. Kostritsky, he repaired Mother’s\r\nfalse tooth and one of my front teeth which had been damaged. He\r\nbrought us news from Granny and both our aunts who were in the Crimea.\r\nFrom a previous letter we had learned that Grandmother was ill and was\r\ncomplaining about the shortage of food and the fact that her belongings\r\nhad been taken away from her, news which distressed us considerably,\r\nespecially my Father. We had also received a charming letter concerning\r\nAunt Olga telling us about her baby son being driven in a carriage\r\ndrawn by a small donkey. I remembered when I was a little girl I rode\r\nin a small wicker chair strapped on the side of a pony. The news\r\nbrought by Dr. Kostritsky was cheerful on the whole.\r\n\r\nFinally Dr. Botkin’s children, Tatiana and Gleb, arrived in Tobolsk.\r\nWe hoped that they would join us in our class work, but even that was\r\ndenied us and we could only see them from the second floor window.\r\n\r\nThe situation was gradually getting worse. Nikolsky was stirring up\r\nmore hatred among the soldiers and poisoning their minds with false\r\ndoctrines.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin spent several hours with Father, telling him of the\r\nconditions in Tsarskoe Selo and Petrograd. We now had a fairly\r\ngood idea of the existing situation in our country. We heard that\r\nPravosudovich, head engineer of the Imperial personal train, had been\r\nshot; also that Kerensky, his relatives and his friends were splurging\r\nat the Catherine Palace, indulging in all kinds of luxuries, of which\r\nwe had deprived ourselves at all times, especially during the war.\r\nKerensky and his friends were driving in our cars and carriages, and\r\neven some servants lay at his feet. Within a short time this man who\r\nnot long ago had appeared on our threshold in Tsarskoe Selo, with men\r\nwhose past was steeped in crime, was now enjoying all the luxuries of\r\nwhich he deprived the original owners.\r\n\r\nWe had several letters from Anna Vyrubova and even some packages. We\r\ngathered from her letters that Anna was having a terrible time, though\r\nher language was cryptic. She was forced to assume her maiden name\r\nin order to avoid persecution. All our mail that came through the\r\nregular channels was censored and the contents were known to Colonel\r\nKobylinsky. Father tried to discourage the sending or receiving of mail\r\nsecretly. He even asked his own relatives to address their letters to\r\nCommissar Pankratov, in order to avoid any misunderstanding. Father\r\nwrote only a few letters, primarily to his mother and to his sister\r\nXenia.\r\n\r\nWe had news from the English sisters of mercy in Petrograd, and\r\nfrom the hospitals in Tsarskoe Selo; also we heard from Countess\r\nOrlova-Davidova; from Shura Petrovsky, whose husband was one of\r\nFather’s aides-de-camp, and from Liuba Khitrovo, sister of Rita\r\nKhitrovo who had been arrested in Tobolsk. The news we received\r\nindicated untold tragedies. Many officers were shot after they\r\nrecovered from the wounds. The Provisional Government cared little for\r\nthese helpless men.\r\n\r\nWe heard that the people wanted their Emperor back and that the Army\r\nwas hostile to the new Government, refusing to take orders from the\r\nformer convicts, spies and invaders, and that it wanted to get rid\r\nof Communist agitators around the country. Again Kerensky refused to\r\nsanction this proposal, because he wanted to retain all power in his\r\nhands, even though it would mean the destruction of Russia. Father knew\r\nthen that the country was lost. We heard all kinds of stories. One\r\nconcerned a boat caught sailing in the dark on the Volga River without\r\nthe permission of the authorities. On the shore, it was discovered that\r\nthis boat carried six bullions of gold, each worth a fortune. When\r\nasked where they were taking this loot, the persons aboard replied that\r\nthey were taking it to the village of one of the leaders.\r\n\r\nKerensky made many blunders. He prevented the Army from crushing\r\nthe revolution at a time when it was ready and willing to do so.\r\nThe soldiers of our regiments, who came with us from Tsarskoe Selo,\r\ncomplained to General Tatishchev that they had not received the\r\nallowances that Kerensky had promised they would receive while they\r\nremained with us. As a result they were discontented. Many of these\r\nmen had to meet their family needs. Some of them were able to obtain\r\nextra jobs, but those who were not able to do so became angry, which\r\nstrengthened their sympathy for Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before Christmas came the shocking news that Kerensky’s\r\nProvisional Government had fallen and that the Bolsheviks had taken\r\ncontrol of the country. He was now receiving a dose of his own\r\nmedicine. The persecutors were more lenient and less cruel toward him\r\nthan he was toward his Emperor and his family. General Tatishchev\r\ntold us that when Kerensky was betrayed by his colleagues--the\r\nBolsheviks--he jumped from the second floor of the Winter Palace in\r\norder to save his life and in his haste to do so left the belt of his\r\ntunic behind. It was said that Prince Volkonsky was an eye witness\r\nto this heroic performance. A brave man, indeed. An Emperor without\r\nportfolio, a minister, a lawyer, an orator, and Napoleon, all in one.\r\n\r\nThere was talk that if the Ukraine were to go to Germany, Father would\r\nbe placed on the throne by German help. Father said, “Never will I or\r\nmy son accept the throne with the help of the enemy.”\r\n\r\nWe learned that the Winter Palace had been plundered and that many\r\nof its treasures were in the hands of foreign bandits from both\r\nhemispheres who came to our country to rob, take and plunder. They\r\npulled down our tricolor flags--white, blue, and red. White stands\r\nfor snow, blue for the heavenly sky and red for the blood spilled in\r\ndefense of our country. They hoisted their own flag over the Winter\r\nPalace. They removed the double eagles from the buildings and were\r\nburning them on the streets before the eyes of respectable citizens.\r\nThey emptied the historical treasures preserved for generations by our\r\nforefathers, the pride and wealth of Russia when she was in her glory.\r\nThese treasures were sold abroad. The wine cellars of the Palace were\r\nbroken open and the mob drank so much wine that some of them literally\r\ndied from it; the rest of the old wines were poured from the bridge\r\ninto the Neva River.\r\n\r\nThe secret police still was working at the time of our arrest. Before\r\nour exile the names appearing below were given to my Father which\r\nhe remembered and made us remember. When some of these men found it\r\nnecessary to escape from Russia for their lives, they were given\r\nsanctuary by other countries, instead of being tried for their crimes\r\nagainst the Russian people. These men dared to look into the eyes of\r\nRussians knowing what they had done to them, and how easy the Russian\r\npeople had forgiven them all the wounds they had inflicted upon them.\r\n\r\nCommunism was founded and organized by these men whose real and assumed\r\nnames follow.\r\n\r\n  _Original names_                            _Changed to_\r\n\r\n  Bronstein                                      _Trotsky_\r\n  Tsederblum changed to Ulianov then to            _Lenin_\r\n  Apfelbaum                                     _Zinoviev_\r\n  Rosenfeld                                      _Kamenev_\r\n  Goldenberg                                   _Mikhovsky_\r\n  Krachmann                                     _Zagorsky_\r\n  Hollender                                  _Mieshkovsky_\r\n  Tsederblum II                                   _Martov_\r\n  Himmer                                        _Sukhanov_\r\n  Goldmann                                        _Goriev_\r\n\r\nWe were told that Tsederbaum (Tsederblum?), Lenin’s father, was\r\narrested for murdering a policeman; his sons were very young. One\r\nson was brought up in Simbirsk by a well-to-do half-Kalmuk and\r\nhalf-Christian family by the name of Ulianov. The other sons were with\r\nLenin’s uncle, Tsederbaum. While in college both boys met secretly\r\nwith other boys and inspired them with revolutionary ideas, such as\r\nthe derailing of the train in which the Emperor and his family were\r\nriding; as a result many people were killed. One brother was hanged;\r\nthe second, Lenin (Ulianov), ran away; and the third was in hiding in\r\nRussia until the revolution when he reappeared. There were two brothers\r\nwho are mentioned above in my list which was given Father while in\r\nTsarskoe Selo. Later in Tobolsk and more so in Ekaterinburg, additional\r\nnames were given to us to remember, the names of men with whom we\r\nactually had contact. Unfortunately I can only remember now the names\r\nof about twenty-five out of a total of approximately one hundred.\r\n\r\nOne morning Colonel Kobylinsky arrived in Father’s study. With tears\r\nin his eyes he informed Father that a peace treaty was to be signed,\r\nbut that prior to the signing the old Russian Army would have to be\r\ndemobilized. Father said that this terrible move by the Bolsheviks was\r\ndangerous not only for Russia but also for the world; that this move\r\non the part of the traitors should now make the Russian people realize\r\nthat they were being deceived. I cannot describe the feeling it left on\r\nus. Father was a prisoner, trapped like a lion in a cage, thousands of\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nBut going back to Kerensky, it is significant that when he was in\r\ndanger, he did everything to save his own life. But he never stopped\r\nto think that he was the one who had sent the Imperial family to the\r\ndistant, frozen North. Did he give a thought to the fact that the\r\nunfortunate victims were trapped by the traitors and by the bribed\r\nconvicts, and not by their own people? Now we could see why he had\r\nordered the arrest of everyone who came to our aid and who was willing\r\nto risk his life, as well as ours, to save us. Kerensky had given\r\nhis word of honor to Father that he would protect us. He knew what\r\nthese men were like and what they were doing. I often ask myself the\r\nquestion: did he do it intentionally? Will one ever know?\r\n\r\nIf Kerensky was sincerely interested in protecting us, he could have\r\nordered the train in which we were traveling, under the Japanese Red\r\nCross flag, to proceed to Vladivostok from where we could have gone to\r\nJapan whose Emperor was quite friendly with Father and would have given\r\nus the protection of his country. During the war we had a visit by two\r\nyoung Japanese Princes who brought beautiful gifts for Mother and us\r\nfrom the Empress of Japan. They also visited Father in Mogilev.\r\n\r\nNow the Russian people were helpless, numb as from paralysis. With\r\nstunned eyes they watched the nightmarish happenings in their country,\r\nthe wiping out of their possessions, and the tragic end of their\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days passed rapidly as winter approached, the cold was relentless.\r\nWe were glad of the warning to bring warm clothes. December was very\r\ncold and it continued through the months of January and February. The\r\nhouse was unbearably cold and our bedroom was like an ice house; even\r\na glass of water had frozen solid overnight. Our rooms were large and\r\neach had only one tile stove, providing scant heat against the raw\r\nwinds that forced themselves right through cracks in the windows. Even\r\nMother, who always preferred cool rooms, complained of the cold. The\r\nonly time the house ever felt warm to us was on coming in from the icy\r\noutdoors.\r\n\r\nMother’s arthritis began to give her serious trouble, her joints and\r\nfingers became swollen. She suffered a great deal of pain and was\r\nnot able to write or paint as much as before. Tatiana had a gift for\r\nnursing. She knew how to care and comfort the sick. She massaged\r\nMother’s frostbitten hands in a bowl of warm water. Mother’s eyesight\r\ntroubled her, too; her glasses no longer helped, since she needed new\r\nones. The cork on the bridge of her frame had broken off and she felt\r\nthis increased her sinus condition which bothered her to the very end.\r\nAfter a long debate a doctor came and she at last had her new glasses.\r\nNow she spent a great deal of time in theological studies and writing\r\nin the old Slavonic language.\r\n\r\nFather’s joints were swollen also, but my saintly Father never\r\ncomplained lest he might worry us.\r\n\r\nWe all were supposed to keep our diaries. Alexei made only occasional\r\nentries. Whenever he was encouraged to think of something, he wrote\r\n“The same old thing.” I too lost interest, for fear that writing\r\nwhat took place in our daily lives might cause us trouble. Olga and\r\nTatiana wrote a great deal, but right after our parents left, General\r\nTatishchev suggested that they burn all unnecessary papers. Olga’s\r\npoems and Mother’s poems and paintings all went up in smoke.\r\n\r\nOur dogs always went with us on our walks. They were our constant\r\ndiversion; they saved these outings from complete boredom. We envied\r\ntheir retrieving sticks we threw and jumping happily, since we\r\nourselves felt cramped. Every morning my own dog Jemmy announced her\r\narrival by scratching frantically at the bedroom door. Her happy mood\r\nmade us forget our troubles. I carried her up and down the stairway,\r\nbecause her legs were too short to climb the stairs. Her long silky\r\nears got into everything. Her long tongue was always out. The poor\r\nanimal did not know that a few months later her happiness would end in\r\nEkaterinburg.\r\n\r\nFor months before Christmas we worked on gifts for everyone who came\r\nwith us from Tsarskoe Selo. We had some yarn on hand and some was sent\r\nto us by our friends. Mother made waistcoats, mufflers, mittens, socks\r\nand wristbands. We tore apart old blouses and fashioned them into\r\nhandkerchiefs and then embroidered initials on them. Pieces of silk\r\nwere made into fancy bookmarks--some of which we painted and some we\r\nembroidered. We wanted to surprise our friends with these gifts, in\r\nappreciation of their loyalty to us.\r\n\r\nMother, however, seemed to have a premonition of trouble. First, she\r\nwas worried about Anna, who, she thought, might be in trouble for\r\nsending letters and packages to us. Mother warned Anna to be careful\r\nabout sending people with messages. She feared they might betray us.\r\nAnd so it happened. The least suspected person was Soloviev, husband\r\nof Matriona, Rasputin’s older daughter. Soloviev came to Tobolsk\r\nseveral times with letters and packages. Even Olga and Marie called the\r\nsituation to Mother’s attention, and suggested that Anna should let\r\nthe officers handle matters and not the Yaroshinsky-Soloviev clique;\r\nbut Mother said that Anna would die before she would betray us.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we gathered in Father’s study which was smaller than our\r\nother rooms. Father read to us and we sewed until our fingers became\r\nso stiff we could hardly hold the needles. But there was a richness\r\nin that room that made us reluctant to complain. Sometimes we played\r\ndominoes, bingo, or durachka, a card game (resembling five hundred)\r\nwhich Father disliked. Tatiana played bridge best of all, while\r\nMother’s favorite was bezique. Ten o’clock was bed time for us younger\r\ngirls, but Alexei used to retire at eight. Later on when life became\r\nmonotonous, Mother asked our friends to join us in the evening. Some\r\nplayed games and others read.\r\n\r\nFather also brought with him his diaries and his letters. These had\r\nbeen confiscated in Tsarskoe Selo but were returned to him when nothing\r\nincriminating was found in them. We sat around Father in the middle of\r\nthe room, away from the draft of the windows, listening to his reading\r\naloud. I am sure his heart felt sad as did our own. We learned many\r\ninteresting events that took place before and during Father’s reign.\r\nFather wanted Olga or Tatiana to write a history of present events as\r\nsoon as we were free, and for that reason he wanted us to remember\r\nevery event that took place before and after our arrest and during our\r\nlife in Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nOur letters to friends were harmless; some went through Colonel\r\nKobylinsky’s hands and were read by him, but some were not. Later, when\r\nwe were in Ekaterinburg, we were shown photostatic copies of these\r\nletters carried back and forth by Soloviev. Then we realized he was a\r\nspy. Once in Ekaterinburg, Mother in her dark hour said, “I warned Anna\r\nagain and again to be careful of what she was doing, and now she has\r\nmade another mistake.” After this Mother never again mentioned Anna’s\r\nname. I hope she did not leave this world with this bitterness in her\r\nheart toward her friend, who unfortunately brought one serious trouble\r\nafter another not only to Mother but to the whole family. Olga and\r\nMarie always opposed Anna but Mother resented anyone saying anything\r\nagainst her friend.\r\n\r\nIt had been promised that when Baroness Buxhoeveden arrived, she\r\nwould be staying with us. We fixed her room ourselves and the final\r\ntouches were approved by Mother. It was Christmas week when she reached\r\nTobolsk. The day she was supposed to come to the house, Colonel\r\nKobylinsky notified Father that he wished to speak to him. He informed\r\nFather that the Soldiers’ Committee decided against her joining us. Not\r\nhaving money Iza and her English assistant organized English classes in\r\ntown and found many people enthusiastic to study this language. She met\r\nus only on the boat when we left for Ekaterinburg.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions, the icon of the Image of the Holy Virgin was brought\r\nfrom the Abalak Monastery to the Church of the Annunciation for\r\nservices which the family attended.\r\n\r\nThe first time was November 14th, old style, the anniversary of my\r\nparents’ wedding. We had prayed before this icon in the Monastery and\r\nwere deeply moved to be able to do so again. The church bells rang as\r\nwe left the church and continued until we reentered the house.\r\n\r\nThe second time was on Father’s name day--December 6th, old style.\r\nNo one was allowed to enter this holy place while we were there. At\r\nthe end of the service, as though nothing had changed, prayers were\r\noffered, ending with a Mnogoletie (“Long Life for the Imperial Family”)\r\nas had always been done before the revolution. We were surprised at the\r\npriest’s courage. Father’s face turned white and we all glanced at each\r\nother. Olga’s pale face turned faintly red, and she wiped her eyes.\r\nWe wondered if there was going to be trouble ahead. There was. They\r\npromptly demanded the death penalty for Father Vassiliev, but he was\r\nsaved, though not for long. He was sent away by Bishop Hermogen and was\r\nreplaced by another one. The nuns too were taken away.\r\n\r\nWe were now forbidden to attend church services, but after hours\r\nof pleading with the Soldiers’ Committee by Colonel Kobylinsky, we\r\nreceived permission to attend church services but only on the twelve\r\nprincipal holidays. From now on the restrictions became more severe.\r\n\r\nFinally Christmas eve arrived. Mother presented everyone with one of\r\nthe gifts we had been working on for months. The villagers too were\r\nthoughtful. They sent us two Christmas trees, one of which we sent to\r\nour friends across the street, with whom we shared some delicacies that\r\nwere sent us by the Ivanovsky nunnery and by the head people of the\r\nlocal museum. In the evening, vespers were held in the big hall and we\r\nwere grateful that there was no interference. We looked forward to the\r\nChristmas morning services at the church.\r\n\r\nSomehow I felt a sadness as we walked along the path packed with\r\nsnow. It was cold and dreary and at eight in the morning still dark.\r\nThe sky overhead was heavy. It gave me simultaneously a feeling of\r\nloneliness and apprehension. It was so quiet that only the crackling of\r\nthe frozen snow under our feet broke the stillness. We did not speak\r\nto each other; each one was occupied with his own thoughts. It is\r\nquietness like this that awakens one’s heart to fond memories of the\r\npast. We crossed the small garden and with my mind’s eye I could see\r\nthe museum, the little park, and in it the proud obelisk dedicated to\r\nYermak, the conqueror of Siberia. A short walk, but my thoughts covered\r\nthousands of miles behind the frozen plains of Siberia. I could see\r\nour Grandmother, our aunts and their children, and our friends, and\r\nI wondered if they had forgotten us. Above all I thought of our old\r\nhomes, where I had spent sixteen happy years of my life. All seemed so\r\ncold and so far away.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts came back to Tobolsk. Only recently we had discussed with\r\nour friends here the historical background of this town. It frightened\r\nme. I thought of the chapel adjoining the Metropolitan’s residence\r\nwhere the Bell of Uglich was formerly hung. This bell summoned the\r\npeople of Uglich when Prince Dimitri, son of Ivan the Terrible, was\r\nmurdered in 1591. By an order presumably given by Boris Godunov, this\r\nbell was transferred to Tobolsk, where it was damaged by fire and\r\nrecast. We too were transferred to Tobolsk, by Kerensky.\r\n\r\nFather realized what the prison life had done to his family. We\r\nonce overheard Father saying to Prince Dolgorukov, in the presence\r\nof Colonel Kobylinsky, that his heart was aching for his little\r\nfamily whose life which had just begun was about to come to an end.\r\nHe continued, “During my whole life I tried to serve my country\r\nfaithfully, and if I have done wrong I am willing to suffer for it. I\r\nam not sorry for myself or my wife, but for the children. It is a crime\r\nto punish these innocent youngsters. They are so pure and so good. They\r\nare the children of Russia.”\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s morning we went to church. It was one of the twelve\r\nholidays on which we were permitted to attend services. The new priest\r\nofficiated but he appeared nervous. Then we heard that our former\r\npriest, Father Vassiliev, who had officiated at the previous service,\r\nhad been taken away from the Abalak monastery. He was then tied, beaten\r\nand thrown still alive into the Tobol River in front of the monastery.\r\nIt was very cold that morning. The temperature often went down to\r\n25°-35° below zero. The church was unheated but dimly lighted, and we\r\ncould offer only one candle apiece. Although we were provided with\r\nrugs, even then our feet were numb from the cold, but our hearts found\r\ncomfort, warmth and hope ahead. Due to the extreme cold, my sisters and\r\nbrother became ill again with the German measles. This time, however,\r\nthey were not so seriously ill as the previous year.\r\n\r\nThrough General Tatishchev Father was informed that we could not go\r\nto church on Epiphany day, commemorating the baptism of our Lord,\r\nwhich falls some twelve days after Christmas. It was decided to build\r\na movable altar in a corner of the big hall on the second floor,\r\nwhere we took our lessons and gave our plays. Mother busied herself\r\nby supervising the placing of the icons in their proper places. The\r\npriest and the four nuns came to the house for the Divine Liturgy and\r\nthe Blessing of Water. Father and we children sang with the choir\r\nwhich consisted of some members of our staff, including Nagorny,\r\nAlexei’s servant, who had a very fine voice. At the end of the service,\r\naccording to custom, the priest dipped the cross into the water and\r\nwith it sprinkled the water in the air in the shape of a cross. We all\r\nkissed the cross but when Alexei’s turn came to kiss it, the priest\r\nbent over and kissed his forehead. It touched Alexei deeply. This\r\nkindness meant so much to the little, frail boy. To the last he never\r\nforgot this courtesy, nor did we. We “broke bread” with our friends in\r\nthe dining room downstairs.\r\n\r\nIt was on this day that Prince Dolgorukov and General Tatishchev\r\npleaded with Father to have his epaulettes removed. For the sake of his\r\nfamily, finally Father gave in. Right then and there something died\r\nwithin him. He did keep his St. George’s Cross and the French Croix de\r\nGuerre. He was very proud of them. Father told his valet, Chemodurov,\r\nthat General Tatishchev should remove the epaulettes before brutal\r\nhands touched them. With a painful expression the general removed them.\r\nI remember when the St. George decorations were given to Father and\r\nAlexei. General Ivanov sent Father’s friend Prince (Toly) Bariatinsky\r\nto present these decorations while Father was home for a few days.\r\n\r\nPractically buried by snow, we were permitted to make a mountain.\r\nHundreds of shovelsful of snow were carried up and covered with water,\r\nwhich froze immediately. The process was repeated until a good sled\r\ncourse was built. We helped our friends, Prince Dolgorukov and M.\r\nGilliard, as well as the soldiers, until we were exhausted.\r\n\r\nJanuary 12th/25th was Tatiana’s twenty-first name day. After the\r\nTe Deum, which was held in the house, we all extended to her our\r\ncongratulations. Even the soldiers of the Fourth regiment presented her\r\nwith various blooming plants and flowers. Except for Mother, we had no\r\ngifts for her.\r\n\r\nWe heard that Felix Youssoupoff was killed. Mother said, “God forgive\r\nhis mistakes.” Later the rumor was denied.\r\n\r\nWe had a swing in the back yard, but Nikolsky’s men at night wrote\r\nvulgar words on the wooden seat board. We were forbidden to go near\r\nit until Dr. Botkin, Colonel Kobylinsky or Pankratov had examined it.\r\nOur outdoor exercises were limited to the small space allotted to us.\r\nEach day they found something new to accuse us of. One afternoon Alexei\r\nwas on the front steps before the house, which were protected by a\r\nwall about 2-3 feet high on either side. He heard some children on the\r\nstreet and climbed on top of this wall which was about 35-40 feet from\r\nthe fence. Nikolsky saw Alexei from the window, and like a bullet ran\r\nout of the house and loudly reprimanded the little boy, who had done no\r\nharm. From then on we feared him.\r\n\r\nFrom the window, hungrily, I watched the children romp and play all\r\nwrapped up like little bear cubs in bright red felt boots. They rode\r\naround in bright colored orange or red sleds, or were drawn by plucky\r\nlittle horses which reminded me of the Crimea. These ponies looked so\r\nwarm in their winter “coats” and so alive as they tramped over the\r\npacked snow with their bells ringing and jauntily pulled their sleighs\r\nbehind them. I pressed my face against the window. The jingling bells\r\noutside and the icy cold of the window cutting into my cheek inside\r\nwere cruel substitutes for my great desire to go sleigh riding myself.\r\n\r\nNikolsky taught the soldiers all kinds of communistic doctrines which\r\nhe called Yurovsky’s teaching. At that time we did not know who this\r\nevil Yurovsky was. The hatred Nikolsky taught to the men, he was to\r\nexperience himself. Soon afterwards the soldiers drove Nikolsky out.\r\nUnfortunately, old Pankratov had to go too. His going was a loss to us\r\nbecause he always defended us. From what we heard in advance about the\r\nnew commissar who was coming from Ekaterinburg, we were apprehensive.\r\n\r\nThere were many repercussions in store for us. All the old soldiers\r\nof the Fourth and First regiments, who had come with us from Tsarskoe\r\nSelo, were ordered to leave. Before they did so, however, they came\r\nquietly one by one to Father’s study to say good-bye. Almost all of\r\nthem cried as Father embraced them and thanked them for their loyalty\r\nto us. One of them brought a small body icon for Father to remember him\r\nby, and another one brought with him a small notebook which he asked\r\nus to autograph. Two men from the Fourth regiment refused to leave\r\nthe place, saying that they would stay to guard their Emperor. At the\r\npoint of a gun they were taken away and later we heard that they were\r\nshot, near the river. When the last several hundred men were leaving,\r\nthey assembled on the street behind the fence in front of the house. We\r\nall, even Mother, went part way to the snow mountain to see our friends\r\ndepart. We were never to see them again. The whole family and all\r\naround us were crushed by their going and, as they went, our hopes left\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nWe derived a lot of pleasure out of tobogganing on the snow mound we\r\nhad worked so hard to build. But our pleasure lasted only one month.\r\nTo the guards the snow mound was a sore spot and we tried to pacify\r\nthem by not going to its top, so as not to attract the attention of\r\npassers-by who often gathered on the other side of the street to watch\r\nus. Notwithstanding, the Soldiers’ Committee decided to have the mound\r\ndemolished. We soon heard heavy chopping and pounding in the garden,\r\nand we knew then that the snow mound was being destroyed. They cut deep\r\nnotches across the mound so it could not be used for tobogganing and\r\nin order to prevent us from looking across the street. We showed no\r\nresentment at what they did, although in our hearts we felt differently.\r\n\r\nNow we had even less space for exercise than we had had before and\r\nwe tried to amuse ourselves as we elbowed each other in the yard. We\r\nlooked at each other understandingly even though no words were uttered.\r\n\r\nMore bad news reached us, that agents of the underground, friends\r\nand relatives of the men listed previously, continued to pour into\r\nRussia from foreign countries by the thousand, followed later by\r\nGenerals Pilsudski and Ludendorff and Count von Mirbach, the German\r\nAmbassador. We were told that all the buildings in Moscow including\r\nall of the Imperial quarters in the Kremlin were taken over by these\r\nintruders. These men ordered that the Russian Army be disbanded and\r\nthat all German and Austro-Hungarian prisoners of war be released from\r\nthe camps. These camps were scattered on the important railroad lines\r\nand mining regions throughout the territories of Omsk, Tomsk, Tiumen,\r\nEkaterinburg, Cheliabinsk and other cities.\r\n\r\nUp to now Father had refused to allow himself to be depressed. But this\r\ntime he no longer was able to hide his feelings. He suffered painfully,\r\nbecause he believed his Allies, in whom he had had faith, had failed\r\nto help him in these difficult times. They could have prevented these\r\nmen from coming to Russia. Instead, passports and other documents were\r\nissued to them. Father said again that fifty years from now there would\r\nbe no democracy left, that when Russia falls the whole world will fall\r\nwith it. A year later, when I recalled these words, in 1919, I wrote in\r\nmy notebook, “Only the future will tell.”\r\n\r\nFather was so distressed that he often sat up at night with only a\r\nlittle flickering lamp in the corner of his study. Mother knew that\r\nFather could not sleep. We heard the cracking of the floors which were\r\nmore pronounced at night. She had left her bedroom and gone to him. We\r\nheard her say: “Nicky, are you not tired? Can you not sleep? I came to\r\nkeep you company, dear.” Said Father: “No, Alicky, I am not tired. I\r\nthank you for thinking of me.” Such words of devotion and understanding\r\nalways rang in our ears.\r\n\r\nThe only joy we had at this time was whenever we heard from our family\r\nor our friends. We longed so much to see our aunts, especially Aunt\r\nOlga’s baby. Aunt Xenia’s letters described to us the little man so\r\ncharmingly that we felt as if we knew him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX DANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Nikolsky and Pankratov left, Colonel Kobylinsky brought back\r\nthe key to the balcony which Nikolsky had taken away. Now Mother was\r\nagain able to sit on the balcony in the sun. For several months we\r\nlived quietly and peacefully. But when the new guards came, our lives\r\nsaddened.\r\n\r\nOne day Olga was found crying. She had been unhappy. She said that\r\nshe had been observing the developments and believed that we were\r\ndoomed. Father sent for Colonel Kobylinsky who admitted that danger was\r\ncreeping upon us. Prince Dolgorukov and General Tatishchev believed\r\nshe was right and thought we should escape before the new commissar\r\nfrom Ekaterinburg arrived. But our parents refused to leave Russia, and\r\nwould not think of separation. We humbly bowed our heads and accepted\r\nthe inevitable.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden a change came into our lives. The Bolsheviks turned\r\ntheir binoculars on us. One day Colonel Kobylinsky informed Father\r\nthat the Imperial family must go on rations, because keeping us was\r\ntoo heavy a burden on the Communist regime. Each one of us was to\r\nreceive 600 rubles per month, the same as the soldiers. Father knew\r\nnothing about the cost of the operation of our establishment. He asked\r\nM. Gilliard, who was the most practical of all, to set up a budget and\r\nPrince Dolgorukov and General Tatishchev to help him. When they came\r\nwith figures, it was concluded that ten servants had to be discharged.\r\nMy parents became terribly distressed and made all kinds of excuses:\r\nthis one had a sick mother, another had an invalid son, a third was\r\nthe sole supporter of his motherless children. What would happen to\r\nall these families who came here from Tsarskoe Selo? It went on and\r\non. At last Gillek (M. Gilliard) and General Tatishchev made their own\r\ndecision, and ten servants came to thank us for treating them so kindly\r\nin the past. It was sad losing them, though we could not foresee how\r\nfortunate they were.\r\n\r\nThe new commissar from Ekaterinburg arrived and we heard that he had\r\nbrought with him about one hundred men, all fanatical Marxists. He was\r\na red-faced brute by the name of Zaslovsky, with a bad reputation.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the new young men arrived than trouble developed between\r\nthem and the old soldiers who had refused them entry to our residence.\r\nThey became angry and threatened to storm the house. Colonel Kobylinsky\r\nand Zaslovsky were bargaining all night downstairs. We dressed and sat\r\nup expecting trouble. Long after midnight we heard familiar voices in\r\nthe corridor. Colonel Kobylinsky sent for more guards to insure our\r\nsafety. We heard some foreign voices coming from outside the gate, then\r\na loud voice saying, “I am following the orders of Colonel Kobylinsky.\r\nI cannot let you in. Then speak to him.” As a result of this incident\r\nColonel Kobylinsky wanted to resign but Father persuaded him to stay\r\nwith us. We felt that his presence was helpful to us, even though we\r\nknew that he had no power over the new soldiers.\r\n\r\nFather believed that at least ten of the new men were disguised former\r\nofficers. However, if they were former officers they were helpless,\r\nbecause Zaslovsky ordered more men from Tomsk. These men boasted that\r\nthey had killed the director of the Cadet School and destroyed the\r\nheadquarters of the Fourth Siberian Army Corps stationed in Tomsk. They\r\nsaid that they had burned the house on Father’s estate in the town of\r\nBernaul on the river Ob and had killed the superintendent in charge.\r\nFather had inherited several big estates with large milk and cheese\r\nplants in Siberia. Tons of these products were distributed every year\r\nto different charitable institutions. Father had visited his estates\r\nduring the construction of the Trans-Siberian railroad. Zaslovsky\r\nbragged that they had already destroyed the gold smelting works and\r\nhad taken away all the available gold. They also tried to plunder the\r\nmonastery at Tomsk but were driven away by the monks. This is the\r\nmonastery that was referred to previously.\r\n\r\nZaslovsky brought us much misery and inexpressible horror right from\r\nthe start. He ordered us to keep from five to six feet away from the\r\nfence, and to go out only under guard and only for thirty minutes\r\ntwice a day. Our outdoor exercise consisted mainly of cutting wood. We\r\nperformed this humble work in the back of the building cheerfully and\r\nwithout complaining, and by so doing we helped members of our household\r\nwhose duty it was to supply the house with wood. Zaslovsky had our\r\nhouse searched and several items belonging to Father were taken away.\r\n\r\nEach day brought some new deprivations or restrictions and some fresh\r\nheckling by the guards who took pleasure in humiliating us. In return\r\nwe acquiesced in their demands, disarmingly, at least outwardly.\r\nFollowing Father’s example we accepted everything. Among the soldiers\r\nonly a few good men were left. In the past, each relay of guards had\r\nstarted out to be severe, then gradually softened. But not these men.\r\nThey were a dangerous lot. In order to avoid trouble Father and his\r\nfriends--all of them understood carpentry--had earlier built a ladder\r\nwhich led outside to the top of the roof of an unused greenhouse,\r\nwhich had already been converted into a chicken coop. They also built\r\na platform where we could sit in the sun without being seen from the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nMore restrictions were put on us. The last two days before Lent are by\r\ncustom days of merriment during which the people enjoy themselves at\r\nconcerts, balls and in many other ways. Zaslovsky, fearing riots by\r\nthe people, forbade us to leave the house during those two days. The\r\nschools were closed and there was a constant flow of students from the\r\ngymnasium. They were gay; we heard the bells ringing; the children\r\nwere expecting to see the monkey and to hear the organ grinder, who had\r\nstopped before the house for Alexei to witness the spectacle and to\r\nhear the children sing and play. But Zaslovsky had locked the balcony\r\ndoor and had taken the key back to the office. We heard loud voices\r\noutdoors; the guards were driving the students and the youngsters away\r\nwith the butts of their rifles. The youngsters ran and the students\r\ncried: “Go back from where you came, you unwelcome guests.” Zaslovsky\r\nsaid he would shoot anyone who came near the fence. In spite of the\r\nwarning, the passers-by continued to walk past the house, even more\r\nthan before. When the people saw us in the window, they always removed\r\ntheir caps and bowed low.\r\n\r\nSorrow and dread were our constant companions. We woke up with sadness,\r\nand went to bed in sadness. Father tried to read to us, but the silent\r\ninterchange of fear muddled the thread of the story he read. He tried\r\nto make his voice firm and hopeful but it did not have the ring of\r\nformer days.\r\n\r\nUp to now we were able to send and receive some letters from our\r\nrelatives in Ai-Todor in the Crimea. Now we heard that the mail service\r\nwas being discontinued. However, we continued to receive some letters.\r\nSince Zaslovsky’s arrival we had stopped writing letters as we knew\r\nthat they would not be mailed. The last letter we received from the\r\nCrimea told us that the family there had been separated. Aunt Xenia\r\nwith her family and Grandmother had been moved to the chateau of\r\nDyulber, belonging to the Grand Duke Peter Nicholaevich. Though they\r\nwere not far from the Youssoupoffs at Koreiz, still they could not see\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nA few weeks before our departure for Ekaterinburg we received a letter\r\nfrom the family through a peasant woman from the Crimea. She had\r\ncarried this letter surreptitiously thousands of miles. Through her,\r\nin return, we sent a letter to the family in the Crimea, together with\r\na photograph of the family--one of the few we had taken in Tobolsk.\r\nIt was our last link with Granny and our aunts. The very last letter\r\nwe received came from Irene Tatishcheva. A few of our letters were\r\nreturned to us undelivered.\r\n\r\nWe huddled closer together, not so much for warmth, as to feel the\r\nstrength of each other’s presence. In the evening we dreaded to think\r\nof what the morning would bring. Morning returned with the same\r\noverhanging fear. Mother’s first words were: “Thank God for the night\r\njust past and for the breaking of the new day. Also for giving me such\r\na good family. The Almighty is watching over us.” Then Father read from\r\nthe Bible some reassuring message.\r\n\r\nOur brief walks around the yard brought us no inspiration. They were\r\ncut shorter. Mother assured us that God was with us even in our trials.\r\nNo harm could come to those who had faith in Him. He is putting us\r\nto the test. What good is our religion if we are not victorious over\r\nsuffering? So we continued to endure, brightening the darkness in our\r\nhearts with the trust that in time God would lead the way to our safety.\r\n\r\nNot being able to attend church was our hardest punishment. Mother\r\nespecially missed this spiritual support. It had helped us. We had\r\nfound there the answer to our prayers, and temporary relief. Tatiana\r\nmade her decision to sacrifice her life in search of theological\r\nsubjects. She became stronger and firmer in her belief and spent part\r\nof the day in reading the Testaments. Mother was a tower of strength to\r\nus. She was full of resourcefulness and hope, continually replenished\r\nby faith. We felt sure our fate was in the hands of God. This trust\r\nin Him made Father calm and resigned. He was one of those who had the\r\ntruth within him. He carried his grief silently and maintained his high\r\nspirits for the sake of his family. We shuddered at the thought of\r\nbeing separated and clung closer together.\r\n\r\nSuffering had made Mother meek and more tender and her soul had grown\r\nstronger. Under Mother’s influence Olga composed a prayer which\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Give patience, Lord, to us Thy children,\r\n    In these dark, stormy days to bear\r\n    The persecution of our people,\r\n    The tortures falling to our share.\r\n      Give strength, just God, to us who need it,\r\n      The persecutors to forgive,\r\n      Our heavy, painful cross to carry\r\n      And Thy great meekness to achieve.\r\n    When we are plundered and insulted,\r\n    In days of mutinous unrest,\r\n    We turn for help to Thee, Christ-Saviour,\r\n    That we may stand the bitter test.\r\n      Lord of the World, God of Creation,\r\n      Give us Thy Blessing through our prayer,\r\n      Give peace of heart to us, O Master,\r\n      This hour of utmost dread to bear.\r\n    And on the threshold of the grave,\r\n    Breathe power divine into our clay\r\n    That we, Thy children, may find strength\r\n    In meekness for our foes to pray.\r\n\r\nZaslovsky hated everybody. He even kicked our friendly dog Lisa,\r\nbecause the dog wanted to make friends with him. He also beat the dog\r\nin the yard and stepped on our cat without any reason. He said that\r\nbefore he left he would do away with all our pets. We suffered and our\r\nanimals clung to us. When they heard his loud voice downstairs, they\r\nall ran and hid under Mother’s chaise longue. Eventually the soldiers\r\ndrove Zaslovsky away and he went back to Ekaterinburg.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime our finances were getting low and Anna Vyrubova made\r\nan arrangement with a banker named Yaroshinsky to send us some money\r\nthrough Soloviev, the husband of Matriona, Rasputin’s older daughter.\r\nMarie and I knew Yaroshinsky from Tsarskoe Selo. He had financed\r\nMarie’s and my hospital and we had seen him occasionally. He spoke\r\npoor Russian with a Polish accent. He told us once that he had an\r\nuncle who was a cardinal in Italy. Soloviev was entrusted with several\r\nthousands of rubles and some letters to be delivered to us. We did not\r\nknow Soloviev but knew that Anna trusted him and that he had delivered\r\nsome letters to Tobolsk previously. We received only thirty thousand\r\nrubles out of the three hundred thousand that were sent to us by\r\nAnna. Later in Ekaterinburg we were shown copies of all letters and\r\nrecords of the money, which Soloviev took as a payment for spying on\r\nus. Because he was the husband of Matriona, Anna had confidence in him\r\nin financial and other matters. Dr. Botkin told Father that Yurovsky\r\nsaid that Soloviev and Yaroshinsky were friends of General Pilsudski,\r\nLenin and Trotsky and of Voykov (who later, it seems, signed the death\r\nverdict of the Imperial family).\r\n\r\nWe still had about 35-40 employees whose wages we were unable to meet.\r\nFood became a problem. We had no sugar, coffee or butter. When the good\r\npeople of Tobolsk learned of the conditions in the Governor’s house\r\nthey sent us whatever they had. Some of the merchants and the heads of\r\nthe city had met Father in 1891 when, on his way home from Japan, he\r\nhad made an extensive tour throughout Siberia. At that time the museum\r\nof Tobolsk was established and Father deposited a great deal of money\r\nin the Imperial banks for the upkeep of this museum. Magazines and\r\narticles were sent to us and we read them with interest. Incidentally\r\nit was twenty-seven years later, in July also, when the murder took\r\nplace in Ekaterinburg, July 16th-17th, 1918.\r\n\r\nOne morning we awoke to an acute misery; Alexei was ill. The dreaded\r\ndisease had returned. And now our previous deprivations seemed\r\ninsignificant. The youngster’s resistance had been lessened. He was\r\nthin and unable to take the food offered him. As always Mother nursed\r\nhim. Her care for him was the same but her affection for him had\r\nchanged. My heart tells me not to say that, but conscience tells me\r\notherwise. Alexei sensed it. I remember how much Mother loved her\r\nprecious “Agoo” and wanted to have him close to her on the chaise\r\nlongue. I can still see this little boy under a blue silk and lace\r\ncover lying on her chaise, or later, his hand in her hand, going into\r\nhis bedroom to say a prayer. M. Gilliard and all the others knew of the\r\nchange on Mother’s part, and they gave Alexei more love now to make up\r\nfor the loss of a part of his Mother’s affection. We sisters became\r\nmuch closer to him, and our hearts formed as one and this one we gave\r\nto our unfortunate brother and to our Father who suffered so much.\r\n\r\nFollowing the incident when Nagorny was caught carrying a letter from\r\nAlexei to Dr. Derevenko’s son, the Doctor was not permitted to come\r\nto the house. But now his services were needed and he, at last, was\r\nallowed to see his patient.\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions became dangerously bad, following Nikolsky’s\r\ndeparture, Father wrote an important document about the war, which was\r\nplaced in a safe place until a change in the Government should occur.\r\nAt that time it was to be released to the proper authorities. It was\r\nleft in care of four men and it was endorsed and countersigned by at\r\nleast four persons.\r\n\r\nA treaty between Bolshevik Russia and Germany was now in the process\r\nof being signed. We were told that one of its provisions was that the\r\nImperial family was to be brought to Moscow unharmed. Evidently the\r\nGermans suspected that our captors were dangerous and would not spare\r\nour lives. Father feared if the family went to Moscow, he might be\r\nforced to sign the treaty in order to save his family’s life. He said:\r\n“Now the people know who are the real traitors to Russia. All these\r\nyears they have been accusing Mother for being a spy and wanting to\r\nsign a separate treaty with Germany.”\r\n\r\nFather blamed the downfall of the Russian Army--our national pride--on\r\nKerensky, Guchkov, Ruzsky and Shulgin. He said that now Germany would\r\nget all kinds of concessions, which would reduce Russia to poverty,\r\nbut that Germany would not enjoy these concessions. The treaty was\r\nprepared in advance by Tsederbaum, Bronstein, Apfelbaum, Rosenfeld and\r\nothers--better known to the world today as Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev,\r\nKamenev. Not many Russians among them, but traitors. I well remember\r\nthat as we sat one evening, Father said to Prince Dolgorukov, “Valia,\r\nyou remember the time when I refused even to consider a separate treaty\r\nwith Germany. I would not accept any appeasement after the loss of\r\nthousands of lives and all the property damage. I was determined to\r\nbring Germany to her knees. Even if I had signed a separate treaty,\r\nGermany would have paid for all the damage done, and now she is going\r\nto get from the traitors anything she wants.” Father went on, “Germany\r\nwill not enjoy the things she has done to us, and our Allies will not\r\neither. They are digging their own graves and soon they will be buried\r\nin them. If Russia falls, the whole world will topple with her, and\r\nwithin fifty years from now there will be no democracy left, believe\r\nme, Valia.” I remember the last words as though they were spoken only\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nBy betraying his country he would have bought freedom for himself and\r\nhis family. Every soldier knew that Russia was betrayed and that the\r\npropaganda about my family was totally untrue. But they were helpless.\r\nFather never lived for himself but for his people; they sinned against\r\nhim and still he loved them. Mother said the time would come when\r\nthey would stand before Him to answer for murdering our country. The\r\nBolsheviks had every reason to remove Father and all male Romanovs,\r\nbecause by so doing they would eliminate all interference with their\r\nplans, and no emperor would ever be in power again.\r\n\r\nLenin had a personal hatred for the Imperial family. He waited for an\r\nopportunity to get his revenge. When Father was a young man, he and\r\nhis parents were on their way to the Caucasus when the train in which\r\nthey were riding was derailed and eighty people lost their lives and\r\nmany more were injured. The roof of the Imperial car was on the verge\r\nof collapse when my Grandfather, Alexander III, held the roof on his\r\nshoulders, preventing further disaster. Six years afterwards he died\r\nas a result of the injuries he suffered on that day. The conspirators\r\nwho caused this derailment were Lenin and his brother. Lenin’s brother\r\nwas caught and was executed. Lenin himself escaped abroad. The Russian\r\npeople did not know that Lenin was one of the Ulianov-Tsederbaum\r\nbrothers. Later it was established that Lenin himself was the\r\nmastermind in causing this accident. Little did the people suspect that\r\nhe was later also an agent of the German government. Trotsky’s brother\r\nwas also a revolutionary; he was hanged in 1905. Lenin and Trotsky came\r\nto Russia shortly after Father’s abdication. Once my Granny told me\r\nif Grandfather had not held up the roof of the railway car they would\r\nall have been crushed. Aunt Olga suffered an injury to her back, and\r\nGranny to an arm. From the life-size painting which hung in Father’s\r\nbilliard room, I judge my Grandfather to have been enormous, with broad\r\nshoulders and colorful, healthy cheeks, a handsome specimen. I would\r\nnot be surprised if his voice was a deep baritone, like the voice of\r\na lion roaring throughout the vast rooms of the Gatchina Palace. That\r\nkind of impression my giant Grandfather made on me.\r\n\r\nFather was emphatic about two things: He would accept nothing from\r\nGermany and would not permit the family to become separated. After\r\nseeing what these people had done to Father, we sisters, though we\r\nlonged for freedom and an opportunity to enjoy our life, young as we\r\nwere, were ready to sacrifice everything and even die to save our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nA new detachment of guards arrived from Moscow under the supervision of\r\na man named Yakovlev. He had been in Tobolsk for several days and no\r\none knew the reason for his being in town. Before the thirteenth day of\r\neach month approached we feared some kind of trouble, and the 13th of\r\nApril was no exception. On this day Yakovlev put under arrest General\r\nTatishchev, Prince Dolgorukov, Countess Hendrikova, Mlle. Schneider and\r\nMr. Gibbs. They were ordered to move into our house.\r\n\r\nAfter all the rooms had been searched, Yakovlev, wanting to be sure\r\nthat Alexei was ill, brought in a doctor from the outside, who soon\r\nverified the boy’s illness.\r\n\r\nI remember a conversation one evening with Count Tatishchev. Prior to\r\nthe war he represented Father at the German Court and spoke German\r\nfluently. During the war he questioned German prisoners who told him\r\nthat their officers were dissatisfied and that even Von Moltke, the\r\nGerman Commander in the field, was disgusted the way things were going\r\nby 1917, and was in favor of putting the Kaiser under arrest; that\r\nvirtually the Kaiser was a prisoner at his own headquarters and no\r\nlonger had the power to do anything about the situation. Besides, it\r\nwas further said, Germany was at the point of collapse.\r\n\r\nLudendorff was then master of the Army and the Empire. It was the\r\nRussian revolution which was so skillfully promoted by the traitors who\r\nhad settled for a while in Switzerland that saved Germany. Had it been\r\ndelayed even by as short a period as three months, victory would have\r\nbeen ours.\r\n\r\nAnother evening the subject of discussion was the treaty which was\r\nabout to be signed. As usual we were gathered in the big hall. With us\r\nwere Prince Dolgorukov, General Tatishchev, M. Gilliard and Mr. Gibbs;\r\nalso the two ladies in waiting, Mlle. Hendrikova and Mlle. Schneider,\r\nboth of whom were later killed outside of Perm. Father turned to\r\nGeneral Tatishchev and said: “General, do you remember the letter that\r\nWilhelm wrote to me in which he said that he wanted to sign a separate\r\ntreaty with Russia, after which the whole affair would be forgotten\r\nand the two countries would be friends again?” Across the face of that\r\nletter Father had written: “Our friendship is dead.” There was a second\r\nletter, this one to Count Benckendorff, in which the Kaiser asked the\r\nCount to speak to Father about a treaty with Germany.\r\n\r\nWe all knew about these letters as we were at General Headquarters at\r\nthe time. Father showed these letters to Sir John Hanbury-Williams and\r\nthe other members of the Foreign High Command. His own reaction (which\r\nmay have been sent to Berlin by Count Benckendorff) to these letters\r\nwas, “If the Kaiser wants peace, let him make his proposals to all my\r\nAllies; a separate treaty with Russia alone is out of the question. No\r\ntreaty without indemnities to my country and my Allies.”\r\n\r\nPrince Dolgorukov said to Olga, “Knowing how honest His Majesty is, he\r\nwould and could not break the promise he made when he put his hand on\r\nthe Bible, assumed the purple and was crowned, and received the Orb and\r\nthe Sceptre. At the same time he kneeled in prayer to guide him in his\r\nservice as Tsar and Judge of the Russian Empire and to keep his heart\r\nin the will of God asking for His guidance to help him in his task to\r\nrule wisely and be a true father to his people, in order that on the\r\nDay of Judgment he may answer without shame.” During the proclamation\r\nof war Father again swore with his hand on the Bible never to make a\r\npeace with the enemy as long as one enemy soldier was on his soil.\r\n\r\nFather would never have betrayed his Allies. However, the Allies did\r\nnot recognize his loyalty to them and his unwillingness to sign a\r\nseparate treaty with the Central Powers. Because of his loyalty and\r\ntheir failure to recognize it, he underwent great spiritual suffering,\r\nparticularly because he knew that it would mean the end of Russia at a\r\ntime when he so needed the support of the Allies which they failed to\r\ngive. Even the Bolshevik leaders feared that the stubborn Emperor might\r\nbe a threat to them, and decided that the only thing left to do was to\r\nkill him. Father might still be alive today, if he had been willing to\r\nbetray his Allies. It was known that Wilhelm had more confidence in\r\nFather for keeping his word in honorable dealings than in his other\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI SEPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time the new commissar informed Father that he would have to\r\nleave Tobolsk within twenty-four hours; and that, because he could\r\nnot take along the entire family on account of Alexei’s inability to\r\ntravel, he could take with him any other member of the family who\r\nwished to accompany him. That meant separation, the thing we dreaded\r\nmost. Mother was caught between two tortures, at Yakovlev’s mercy. If\r\nshe accompanied her husband, she must leave behind her sick boy, who\r\nneeded her above everything else. But should Father face whatever was\r\nahead alone? Suppose he was to be tried and questioned, would he not\r\nneed her support? Might they not try to force him to sign the shameful\r\nBrest-Litovsk treaty, by threatening to kill his family? Yet Alexei\r\nmight die without Mother. And what about Father? Did this mean death\r\nfor him? We knew that all this was surging through Mother’s tormented\r\nmind, just as it was through ours.\r\n\r\nGeneral Tatishchev wanted to go with Father and said: “Your Majesty,\r\nyou will not sign anything. They will have to kill us both.”\r\n\r\nOlga was like a mother to Alexei. With Gillek, our loyal friend at his\r\nside, and Dr. Derevenko across the street, Alexei would be well cared\r\nfor. At last Tatiana spoke up. She suggested that Mother and Marie go\r\nwith Father. We knew that was the right suggestion. We knew also how\r\nMother and Alexei would grieve for each other. In the midst of this\r\ndiscussion Father, as was always his habit, went outside in the yard\r\nto be alone and not show his agony to others. He had always found the\r\nanswer to his problems when alone, but this time he had none.\r\n\r\nFather was supposed to leave at night, but it was decided to wait till\r\nmorning when it would be safer to travel on the river. If only they\r\ncould wait a few days, perhaps Alexei would be able to go with them. It\r\nwas decided that General Tatishchev should stay in Tobolsk while Dr.\r\nBotkin, Prince Dolgorukov, Chemodurov (father’s old attendant) Sidniev\r\n(our footman) and Anna Demidova, Mother’s maid, would go with them.\r\nColonel Kobylinsky selected eight soldiers of our guard, under the\r\nsupervision of eight officers, who would accompany them on this trip.\r\n\r\nAll day we moved about in a daze, as if we were under hypnotism. Mother\r\nordered her most needed articles to be packed. Tatiana with trembling\r\nhands placed them in the suitcase. She swallowed fast to turn back the\r\ntears but in spite of stoical efforts more than one tear dropped on the\r\narticles and sank deep out of sight. Alexei cried incessantly. With him\r\nwas Gillek (Gilliard), his faithful tutor. Alexei called for Mother\r\nfor hours but she could not go to him. She could not hide her tears.\r\nAt last she found strength to see him. When Gillek left the room,\r\nMother threw herself on her knees in front of his bed and her face next\r\nto his, though she could not control her emotions. Her arms around\r\nAlexei’s thin body, she wept bitterly over the sick boy, “We will be\r\nback in a few days. We will soon be together.” A few drops of valerian\r\nwere given him. While she sat in a chair, holding his hand, Alexei fell\r\nasleep. Then Mother bent over him and kissed her sick boy. He woke\r\nup and started to cry again. We could all see that she had prepared\r\nherself for this ordeal.\r\n\r\nMother understood the seriousness of this trip, that it might mean the\r\ndeath of all three of them. They all accepted it stoically in the hope\r\nthat it might save their country even though it could lead to the loss\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\nThe presence of new guards produced another problem, but Colonel\r\nKobylinsky promised that he would see to it that all who remained\r\nbehind would be cared for by him personally and that he would have the\r\nfew remaining old soldiers on guard in the house and watching over us.\r\nCountess Hendrikova and Mlle. Schneider were to move in with us.\r\n\r\nWhen all the business was finished, late at night we all assembled in\r\nthe large hall. All the employees, with tear-stained eyes, came to say\r\ngood-bye to those who were leaving. Mother embraced all the women and\r\nFather all the men. After tea our friends from downstairs departed. The\r\nfamily did not go to bed; our friends also stayed up all night. At 3:30\r\nA.M. tea was again served to the travellers. All changed into clothes\r\nfor the trip and took with them a few valuables which could be sold, if\r\nnecessary. But upon their arrival in Ekaterinburg, Mother’s and Marie’s\r\nhandbags were searched and the contents confiscated.\r\n\r\nMother drew us daughters into our room. We gathered around her. Then\r\nand there I suddenly realized what Tobolsk had done to her. Mother’s\r\nhair was partly grey and her eyes were sunken deep in her head. Her\r\nbeautiful skin was lined and transparent, and her neck thin and drawn.\r\nHer clothes hung on her wasted frame--she cared little how much she\r\nhad aged. She was speaking slowly as if the choke in her throat would\r\nnot let the words come through. “My only desire,” she said, “is that\r\nshould we ever be scattered outside of Russia, I hope none of you\r\nwill ever choose Germany, and that you will never do anything to\r\ndisgrace yourselves. There will be some people who will try to put you\r\nin a compromising position--to take advantage of your youth. Always\r\nkeep respectable. Never marry for wealth or power, only for love and\r\ndevotion. The greatest happiness I can ask for you, if ever you will\r\nmarry, is that you will love your husbands as I do mine, your dear\r\nFather, and we are thankful, for He has rewarded us by giving us such\r\nan understanding family.”\r\n\r\nWe fell on our knees while she prayed for our safekeeping. Then she\r\ndrew each one of us to her and kissed us feverishly. She embraced us\r\ntogether, then tore herself from our clinging arms and started toward\r\nthe door. Suddenly she was back again to hug us once more. Again and\r\nagain she tried to leave. Each time she came back.\r\n\r\nUntil the last moment we could not believe that God would let this\r\nseparation take place. Not only that we feared what would happen to\r\nthem when they reached their destination, but there was the dangerous\r\nriver to cross for which one closed carriage and several _tarantasy_\r\n(Siberian primitive open carriages) were provided, now that the ice\r\nwas thawing. The night was dark and cold. It was safer to start early\r\nin the morning, because the river freezes overnight, and they had to\r\ntravel in the middle of the river where the ice was thicker and safer.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Marie clutched my hand; my arms flew around her. With\r\nburning cheeks our lips met. Then and there I felt that a great part of\r\nmy life was gone. Marie was my other half.\r\n\r\nFather was the most possessed of us all. He was so brave, parting from\r\nhim was the hardest, for we might never see him again. Mother was gone.\r\nWe stood there motionless, not yet believing, staring at the door she\r\nhad just passed through. She was heading for Alexei’s room. We knew\r\nthat she wanted to be with him alone. We could see into the room. She\r\nfound him crying with his head buried under the covers. He always\r\nthought it was bad taste to cry before others.\r\n\r\nThrough the mist in our eyes we saw Father standing. He was white, but\r\nwith a faint smile on his face, he said: “Come now, children. We will\r\nonly be away for a short time. Hurry Alexei’s recovery so that he will\r\nbe well enough to travel.”\r\n\r\nSomehow we passed the intervening hours with the servants, those\r\nfaithful few who had given us their all in their desire to lessen our\r\nsuffering, friends whose loyalty had lightened our burdens. Now these\r\nfriends were pouring out their love and devotion we so needed, all the\r\ntime assuring us of their watchfulness over Alexei and ourselves.\r\nNothing would happen to him or to us sisters. We never could have\r\ngotten through that night without our friends.\r\n\r\nEach moment we thought to be the last, yet each moment was filled with\r\nthe hope that the trip would be called off. The minutes passed into\r\nhours. Midnight, morning, each second was filled with listening dread.\r\nThen came the guards, and Colonel Kobylinsky and Yakovlev. Mother went\r\nagain into Alexei’s room as he was still crying. Almost gayly she\r\nassured him she would be back soon. Father made a cross over us, gave\r\nhis blessing and kissed our wet cheeks. “All ready,” a voice came.\r\n“Certainly,” Father answered. We followed our parents out of the house\r\nand stood on the steps to see them seated in the waiting _tarantasy_.\r\nIn one a mattress had been rolled to make a seat; it was covered with\r\na blanket. This vehicle, drawn by three horses, Mother and Marie\r\noccupied. The other one had a bundle of straw to serve as a seat, which\r\nalso was covered with a blanket. Father and Yakovlev got into this\r\none. There were also _tarantasy_ to carry the others, all the luggage\r\nand three folding beds. The guards stepped aside; the gate opened and\r\nclosed. They were gone. Prince Dolgorukov, Dr. Botkin, Chemodurov and\r\nAnna Demidova were with them. The officers and soldiers were following\r\non horseback.\r\n\r\nThe gate closed at 4:00 A.M., April 26th, 1918, new style, leaving us\r\nstanding there in tragic silence, confused, frightened, bewildered as\r\nto our future. We ran to our room, threw ourselves on the beds and\r\nsobbed until we could cry no more. Our dear friend Gillek was with\r\nAlexei. We could not get to him. He understood. Thank God, for our\r\nloyal friends who defended us. How much they suffered on account of us!\r\nAnd how many good people lost their lives to save us. God give them\r\neverlasting peace.\r\n\r\nAlexei was calling. The room was full of his calls, pitiful calls\r\nfor Mother and Father. Tatiana bent over him tenderly with both arms\r\nwrapped around his frail body. From utter exhaustion his cries grew\r\nfainter. She pressed him close. At last he quieted down and fell asleep\r\nin his new mother’s arms.\r\n\r\nAfter the parents left, we sisters assumed additional duties. I,\r\nbeing of a restless nature, was given the task of entering all bills\r\nand receipts in a big book at the end of each day. The first time I\r\nopened the book I found inside many bills and copies of receipts and\r\npromissory notes that were given to merchants by Prince Dolgorukov\r\nand General Tatishchev. On inquiry we found out that when the expense\r\nmoney which had been promised to Father by Kerensky and which was to\r\nbe drawn from our own funds, had failed to come, our household bills\r\nhad been cared for, unbeknown to Father, by Prince Dolgorukov and\r\nGeneral Tatishchev. When their own personal funds were exhausted,\r\nthese good friends of ours gave the merchants their own personal notes\r\nguaranteeing payment of these debts. This fact was kept secret from\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nThe same railroad for which Father and his forefathers laid the first\r\nstone in construction was now to carry him to his death. All was left\r\nfor the new masters who claimed credit for everything and who even\r\nchanged the names of our once proud cities, universities, hospitals,\r\npalaces, museums, industrial and other enterprises, regarding which\r\nthey had nothing in common except the desire to blow them up at the\r\nfirst opportunity. They renamed them after the worst thieves and\r\nmurderers in all history. Petrograd, built by Peter the Great, they\r\nchanged to Leningrad after that murderer, Lenin, whose body upon his\r\ndeath became black and so badly decomposed that the poor chemist was\r\nshot because he was not able to complete the process of embalming.\r\n\r\nThe leaders went into the prisons where among thousands of innocent\r\nofficers, clergymen and others, they found a man resembling Lenin.\r\nAt four o’clock in the morning they shot the innocent victim and his\r\nbody was embalmed. Later that same morning Lenin’s body was disposed\r\nof. Today millions of tourists see this mausoleum on Red Square close\r\nto the wall of the Kremlin. Within a short distance of the red brick\r\nwall lie the Holy Sanctuaries. Here are the remains of the murdered man\r\nunder glass. If you should see this man, do not condemn him, for he is\r\nan innocent victim, but pray for him that his suffering was not long.\r\nI have heard this from a friend who met a sister of the nurse who was\r\npresent at this event.\r\n\r\nThe curtain had fallen on the travellers--Father, Mother and Marie.\r\nThey had left. The new day could not draw the curtain aside to permit\r\none look into their uncertain future. Only our anxiety could keep them\r\nfrom continuing the trip and force them to return. Perhaps the river\r\nwould prove impassable and they would have to wait for the thaw, when\r\nwe could all go together. If Alexei’s illness had not delayed our\r\ntrip, perhaps we would all have been taken to Moscow. Probably Mother\r\nwould have given her consent that the children go abroad, and she and\r\nFather would have stayed in Russia. This matter was laid before her,\r\nbut she would not listen. She emphasized that the trial was only the\r\npreparation of the spirit; she was willing to die for her country. She\r\nprepared us to believe her belief. Olga, Marie, Alexei and I were not\r\nwilling, Tatiana accepted the inevitable.\r\n\r\nWe received no news to break our apprehension; no sunshine dispelled\r\nour dread. Dread loomed everywhere, but we knew we must not give in but\r\nhope this trip would bring betterment to our lives. There was Alexei to\r\ncheer and there were new guards to win over.\r\n\r\nAt night we heard heavy footsteps and the clicking of arms. Every\r\nsound suggested fear. We heard that Count Benckendorff was negotiating\r\nwith Mirbach for our rescue. Olga kept warning us to be particularly\r\ncareful. “Now that we are alone, we must be cautious with those cruel\r\nmen,” she said. When Dr. Botkin left us, we lost one of our staunchest\r\nprotectors. Now our good friend and tutor, M. Gilliard, played the role\r\nof a brother to us. Other friends who had moved into our house were\r\nnow fellow prisoners. They were helpless but at least we had them as\r\nconsultants. Colonel Kobylinsky, that blessed little man, was still\r\nwith us. It gave us comfort. Others too were protecting us, including\r\nGeneral Tatishchev, Mlle. Bittner, Shura Tegleva, and Alexei’s faithful\r\nUkrainian servant, Nagorny.\r\n\r\nThe guards continued to flow into Alexei’s room to check on his health.\r\nThey still did not believe he was ill. We sisters were anxious for\r\nAlexei to be well, so that when the river thawed we should be able to\r\nfollow our parents. Meantime one of the men who drove the family half\r\nway to Tiumen brought a letter from Marie describing the incredible\r\ncondition of the river. It was a miracle that Mother had survived\r\nthat trip. We were sick at heart that they were suffering there,\r\nwhile here we suffered just as much. The new guards were rough and\r\nfrightening. We submitted to their tyranny, making no challenge to\r\ntheir disagreeableness. But we were eager for any news which might come\r\nto us through Colonel Kobylinsky. Now the poor man had grown nervous\r\nand troubled, his hands shook and a strain was noticeable on his face.\r\n\r\nThe following day Colonel Kobylinsky brought word that the family was\r\nsafely on the train. The destination was not mentioned. Then came a\r\nshort note from Mother addressed to us all. It said the journey had\r\nbeen very difficult but they were on the train. We tried hard to read\r\nbetween the lines but found nothing more there.\r\n\r\nDay after day followed monotonously; anxiety made us too tired to\r\nthink; and we lost interest in our studies. In spite of M. Gilliard’s\r\nand Mlle. Bittner’s gentle approach, we could not concentrate on our\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nWe grieved for those we loved most. Every turn we made, the emptiness\r\nreminded us of the former times and we were unable to escape from that\r\nfeeling. Our hearts beat painfully without refreshing news.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Week was unbearably sad. Almost four days passed without news.\r\nAt last on Good Friday, Colonel Kobylinsky received a telegram. It\r\nread, “We are safe.”\r\n\r\nThe only comfort we had was when we noticed an improvement in Alexei’s\r\nhealth. We tried to amuse him, but he too had no thought beyond what\r\nwas happening to Mother and Father. Now I realized why Mother had taken\r\nMarie with her. In case of separation from her husband, she would not\r\nbe left alone. Marie had the patience of a saint, her presence would be\r\ncomforting to both.\r\n\r\nOlga was frail in nature. Mother had wished to spare her this trip if\r\npossible. Tatiana would take the responsibility for Alexei’s care.\r\nTo alleviate the boredom, I had been given the responsibility of\r\nkeeping the family accounts and soon assumed the role of family banker\r\nand bookkeeper. A special permit was required each day for our food\r\npurchases. Every evening, I entered in the ledger all our expenditures;\r\nGeneral Tatishchev made me believe I was indispensable in that capacity.\r\n\r\nNagorny was a godsend to Alexei. He slept in Alexei’s room and kept the\r\nboy busy, amusing him with tales of his province in the Ukraine; of the\r\ngreat poet Taras Shevchenko, and he recited some pastoral and other\r\npoems, including “Naimichka” (The Maid), a beautiful poem. This great\r\npoet asked to be buried in the expanse of the golden wheat fields on\r\nthe broad Dneiper River. Here Alexei used to wade and play in the sand\r\nat General Headquarters in Mogilev.\r\n\r\nOur days were long, but the nights were even longer. On Easter Eve we\r\nwere permitted to attend the midnight service in the big drawing room.\r\nIt was a sad performance. We heard that the guards had completely\r\ndisrobed the priest and searched him thoroughly. They searched the\r\nnuns, too, who came to sing in the service. They insulted them. During\r\nthe service the guards were disturbing and hurled improper remarks. Had\r\nwe known what would happen, we would not have requested the service at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nOutside there was the constant sound of footsteps on the wooden\r\nsidewalk. Now that the snow had begun to melt, the garden was full of\r\nslush. Soon we were not allowed to go out at all. We waited anxiously\r\nfor Alexei to get well and for the ice to melt on the river. Then we\r\nreceived a letter, ominously brief. It said the family had halted at\r\nEkaterinburg. They were safe, but there was no detailed explanation.\r\nAll three of them were accommodated in one room. Marie slept on the\r\nfloor. We were grateful that Father, in particular, had not been taken\r\nto Moscow where he would have met a disastrous end, because he would\r\nnever have agreed to sign a treaty harmful to his country.\r\n\r\nWe knew of Ekaterinburg from Father and General Tatishchev. We had\r\npassed around the city on the train en route to Tiumen the summer\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally the founder of Ekaterinburg was an ancestor of General\r\nTatishchev who had dedicated the name Ekaterinburg to the Empress\r\nCatherine the Great. General Tatishchev was destined to be shot in his\r\nancestor’s city of Ekaterinburg years afterwards. My Father had many\r\nfriends and relatives interested in different business enterprises. The\r\nImperial family owned the stone cutting works and had other commercial\r\noperations. Close friends of ours had extensive businesses in this\r\nregion. Knowing this vicinity General Tatishchev spent several evenings\r\ntelling us about the city, where two months later my family, and he as\r\nwell, were destined to be murdered.\r\n\r\nAlexei was nearly well but the river was still not open for navigation.\r\nAny day, however, the conditions would be right for our departure. The\r\nCommandant ordered Dr. Derevenko to let him know the minute the boy\r\nwould be able to travel. Once more our house was searched. They took\r\nmany of Father’s belongings.\r\n\r\nThe men who guarded us at this time were the most vicious we had had.\r\nThey hurled obscene words at us, then laughed at our flushed faces.\r\nRodionov, the new commissar, was a wild bloodthirsty Latvian, always\r\ninsulting. He took several pieces of our valuable possessions as\r\nsouvenirs. Now almost all our guards were completely new and strange\r\nto us. The only friendly ones who remained were those who, thanks to\r\nColonel Kobylinsky, were posted at each door. They were old guards and\r\nsaw to it that only his own men could enter our rooms.\r\n\r\nWe received orders not to lock our doors at night: our last bulwark\r\nof privacy was removed. On the pretense of finding out whether we\r\nwere asleep, at any time of night, a guard without knocking or asking\r\nfor permission was free to enter our bedrooms and other rooms. Now\r\nthat Marie was gone, we three sisters remained in the same corner\r\nbedroom. Being frightened, we took turns guarding our room at night.\r\nWhile the other two slept, one of us sat up in bed on watch, wrapped\r\nin a blanket. When the floors creaked, we knew that the guard was\r\napproaching, and the one on watch would lie down pretending to be\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nWe became insensitive to the new guards and were no longer annoyed by\r\ntheir overbearing conduct. Our worst anxiety was to get some news from\r\nColonel Kobylinsky, but he did not appear; not in the morning, not in\r\nthe afternoon, not the next day. What did all this mean? He had never\r\nstayed away so long. Finally the news came; our beloved Colonel had\r\nbecome ill and had been sent away just a few days before our nearing\r\ndeparture and was not permitted to say good-bye. We hoped our parents\r\nwere not informed about this. It would add greatly to their troubled\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nThe guards were now everywhere, even at the door of our bathroom. We\r\nnever went alone to bathe, always Shura or Mlle. Schneider was with\r\nus. One morning Tatiana crossed the hall on her way to the dressing\r\nroom. A guard followed her closely, though she was not at first aware\r\nof it. When she heard footsteps behind her, she turned back suddenly\r\nand bumped into Rodionov, thus crashing into the wall. He had something\r\nhard on his person which hit her breast, so that she was pained and\r\nfrightened. She screamed. When we arrived she was trembling and ghastly\r\npale. She did not get over the shock for some time. After this incident\r\nnone of us dared go into the bathroom alone. Always Volkov, Mother’s\r\nold groom of the chamber, or Nagorny paced back and forth in the hall.\r\n\r\nFrom then on we assumed a mock respectfulness, hoping to shame these\r\nmen and to arouse their conscience. We believed the only way we could\r\nhold them at bay was by appealing to their sense of honor. But the way\r\nthey leered and chuckled gave us a feeling of hopelessness. Without my\r\nFather, Dr. Botkin, or Colonel Kobylinsky they might dare anything.\r\n\r\nMay 6th, old style, was my Father’s birthday, his second during our\r\ncaptivity. It was distressing to think this was the first time in our\r\nlives we could not congratulate him. Marie told us later that Mother\r\nand Father wished to have a service in Ekaterinburg on that day, but no\r\npriest was permitted to come to the house.\r\n\r\nMore than ever we were anxious to be on our way. The desire to be with\r\nour parents was above all else. Yet we wanted to do nothing which might\r\nharm our brother. The lack of letters and news from our family spelled\r\ntragic overtones. One or two letters did arrive from Dr. Botkin to\r\nhis son Gleb and daughter Tatiana, and they managed to relay news to\r\nus. But these messages told little beyond the word “well.” That word\r\ntold us they were alive but were so restricted they were unable to\r\ncommunicate with us.\r\n\r\nAt last the river opened and the boats could navigate. Alexei, though\r\nfar from well was able to sit up in a wheel chair. We hoped the trip\r\nmight help him to get his strength more quickly, especially the thought\r\nthat he was on the way to his Mother might prove a tonic. With this\r\nidea in mind we persuaded Dr. Derevenko to tell the Commandant that\r\nAlexei was able to travel. At once he was glad to comply with our\r\nwishes, since our condition was so wretched.\r\n\r\nFor some time in anticipation of this signal our suitcases had been\r\npacked. We had very few clothes with us. But Anna Demidova on behalf\r\nof Mother wrote to us from Ekaterinburg, that the medicine (meaning\r\nthe jewels) should be packed carefully. General Tatishchev took the\r\ninventory; there were not many pieces, but they were invaluable. The\r\nGeneral estimated the value of the stones and other items at between\r\nthree and four million rubles. He and Gillek (M. Gilliard) and Shura\r\nTegleva took great care in placing them in our clothes, suitcases,\r\nand pillows. We were to carry these things with us. Some of the\r\nlarge stones had been removed from their settings in Tsarskoe Selo.\r\nMother also had taken from her big trunk in Tsarskoe Selo a few small\r\nvaluable laces, which she always supervised when the inventory of these\r\npriceless pieces was taken, usually twice a year.\r\n\r\nIt had now been three weeks since our parents had left and we had lived\r\nthrough all kinds of hardships. The night before we were notified that\r\nour departure was scheduled in the morning at 11:00 A.M. The guards\r\nwere standing at each street corner, as they hurriedly whisked us\r\nthrough the streets to the dock.\r\n\r\nOn May 20th, 1918, we boarded the “Rossia,” the same boat that brought\r\nus to Tobolsk almost ten months before. No other boats followed\r\nus. We reached the steamer before noon, but not until late in the\r\nafternoon did we start to move. No one was allowed on the dock but in\r\nthe afternoon people crowded on the river bank to see us depart. Some\r\npressed handkerchiefs to their faces, some wiped their eyes with their\r\nlong sleeves, some made crosses in the air or on their breasts. When\r\nthe crowds grew larger we were told to get back into our cabins, which\r\nwere damp and cold.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour or so later, before our departure, we were allowed to\r\ncome out on the upper deck. We recognized some familiar faces on the\r\nshore, but were puzzled not to see the Botkin children among the\r\npeople. We could not later explain the reason to their father. Upon our\r\narrival in Ekaterinburg, fearing for their safety, Dr. Botkin addressed\r\na letter to Voykov in regard to their coming, but the sinner’s eyes\r\nwere closed. Later Nagorny told us that one man had called out:\r\n“Lunatics, what are you doing to this innocent family? God will punish\r\nyou for your brutality.” Rodionov, having heard this remark, said to\r\nus, “Your friends called us lunatics.” They were lucky that the boat\r\nwas sailing, otherwise not one of them would be alive now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V Ekaterinburg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII REUNION\r\n\r\n\r\nWith us on the “Rossia” were General Tatishchev, Mlle. Hendrikova, Iza\r\nBuxhoeveden, M. Gilliard, Sidney Gibbs and Mlle. Schneider, who had\r\nonce taught Russian to Mother and Aunt Ella; also Alexei Dmitriev, the\r\nhairdresser; Alexandra Tegleva, governess; Elizabeth Ersberg and Miss\r\nTutelberg (“Tootles”) and Alexei (Diatka) Volkov, Mother’s groom of the\r\nchamber; valet Trup; Leonid Sidniev, Klementy Nagorny, Ivan Kharitonov,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nWe were concerned about Alexei, so we went to his cabin and to our\r\ndismay we found that he and Nagorny had been locked up in the cabin for\r\nthe night. Dr. Derevenko, too, was not permitted to see my brother. The\r\nDoctor and Nagorny protested such cruelty toward the sick boy. Rodionov\r\nshouted back, saying, “You will see who is running this boat.” Then\r\nafter a series of curses in Russian and expressions in some foreign\r\nlanguage, he continued: “I have orders to shoot anyone who resists.”\r\nNo more could be said or done, and we were thankful that Nagorny was\r\nwith him. We were not allowed to close our cabin doors. The trip to\r\nEkaterinburg would not be long! We did so hope nothing would happen to\r\nAlexei now at the last minute. The spring air on the river Tobol--the\r\nlittle that sifted through our windows--was refreshingly sweet, though\r\nthe cabins were raw and chilly. The next day they permitted us to sit\r\non deck. We could see the shores were a fused iridescence of the early\r\ntree leaves; the stream was swollen and formed numerous little lakes.\r\nFrom our midstream view the world seemed tenderly beautiful. Could our\r\nworld be tender? Was this a new beginning, or an end?\r\n\r\nThe guards armed with bayonets were everywhere, dampening any desire on\r\nour part to indulge in any kind of conversation. Whoever spoke to us\r\nhad to raise his voice well above normal, speak in Russian only, and\r\nsit at some distance from us. We were happy when Alexei was allowed to\r\nbe carried out on the deck in his wheel chair. He remained quietly in\r\nthe sunshine; his eyes followed M. Gilliard whenever he left him for a\r\nmoment. Alexei was very attached to this faithful friend and protector.\r\nHe was afraid to talk for fear he might be locked up in his cabin\r\nagain. He sat worried and forlorn, occupied with troubled thoughts. The\r\nlittle fellow realized the seriousness of his trip, he was obviously in\r\ndeep agony. Our hearts beat painfully for him. We tried to play some\r\ngames but none could concentrate. We spoke little for fear they might\r\nmisinterpret our most innocent conversation.\r\n\r\nOn the second morning, May 22nd, we arrived in Tiumen. Here were more\r\nguards armed to the teeth, even with a machine gun. They were afraid of\r\npossible riots when we would disembark. There were crowds of people to\r\nsee the arrival of the first boat of the season, or perhaps they were\r\naware of our being on board. We waited on the boat several hours before\r\nwe disembarked, then we walked from the landing, crossing the same\r\ntracks to the waiting train as we had done, in reverse, the previous\r\nyear. A group of ladies threw flowers at our feet, but we did not dare\r\nto look in their direction. We saw they were wiping their tears with\r\nhandkerchiefs. Many crossed themselves and others made a cross in our\r\ndirection. Still others stood motionless except for their quivering\r\nlips. An elderly gentleman knelt down. Immediately a guard pushed him\r\nover, swearing at him in a mixed tongue. I felt ashamed to see such\r\nbrutal disrespect for venerable years. This Russian gentleman was one\r\nof the old generation. I could tell by his posture and by the cut of\r\nhis clothes. He had a familiar look; it seemed I had seen him before\r\nsomewhere. Tatiana asked Commissar Rodionov if it would be possible\r\nto have Baroness Buxhoeveden and others with us. He grinned, saying\r\n“Panie, nyet” (lady, no).\r\n\r\nWe were exhausted and hungry. We had had nothing to eat since noon\r\nthe day before, and still there was a long trip ahead of us to\r\nEkaterinburg. Finally our brave Nagorny managed to get us a bottle of\r\nmilk. I presume someone gave it to him and he rushed to give it to us.\r\nWe sisters each had half a glass and the rest we saved for our brother.\r\nThen we were transferred to the train. One car was assigned to us girls\r\nand our brother. One side of the aisle was occupied by us sisters and\r\nHendrikova, Buxhoeveden, Schneider, and Ersberg. On the other side\r\nwere General Tatishchev, Alexei and Nagorny. We were not allowed to\r\nspeak with those on the other side. Now Alexei was separated from his\r\ndevoted teacher and protector, M. Gilliard. The rest of the suite, we\r\nunderstood, was in the car behind.\r\n\r\nWe did not dare to undress that night since the guards were pacing back\r\nand forth in the aisle and at each end of the car. They stood or sat\r\ncontinually guarding us as if we were criminals. The shades were pulled\r\ndown all night, but several dim lights were kept on. We knew we were\r\napproaching Ekaterinburg when the guards spoke of Bazhenovo, a town\r\nnear Ekaterinburg. At midnight the train stopped and we spent the rest\r\nof the night there on the train. We remembered Bazhenovo where, on our\r\nway to Tobolsk, we had stopped along the track. Father had told us that\r\nnear here were the famous emerald mines.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock in the morning several men entered our car and said,\r\n“Please carry your own personal luggage.” The guards made no move to\r\nhelp us. Nagorny, heavily guarded, was told to pick up Alexei. Without\r\na word he carried him off the train. It was raining and dark clouds\r\nwere hanging over the area making a most depressing day. Some people\r\nstood near the road under the trees which had begun to show their green\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nEvidently the news of our arrival had leaked out. The guards loudly\r\nordered the people to turn their backs toward us. We carried our heavy\r\nsuitcases and other belongings. Olga had been ill during the night and\r\nwas still so dizzy she could hardly walk. She was unable to carry much.\r\nWe feared she had had a heart attack that night but Dr. Derevenko, who\r\nwas probably in the next car, had not been allowed to see her. Four\r\nor five carriages met us near the railroad tracks, I presumed in the\r\noutskirts of the city. I remembered passing Ekaterinburg the previous\r\nsummer on the way to Tiumen. The railroad ran partly around the town;\r\nthere were two stations. I think our train was stopped near the station\r\nwhere a demonstration on the part of the populace would be less likely.\r\n\r\nNagorny placed Alexei in the first carriage, then he ran toward us to\r\ngive us a hand. He tried to reach for the heavy suitcase which Tatiana\r\nhad carried with great effort in one hand, the dog and the blanket in\r\nthe other, but he was brutally pushed aside. We struggled with our\r\nburdens in the muddy ground mixed with cinders; no one was permitted to\r\ncome to our assistance. Our carriages with suitcases and a commissar in\r\neach followed the carriage bearing Alexei and Nagorny. While the rain\r\ncontinued, they raised the hood of the carriage in which I rode. In the\r\ncarriage with me was a man whom I later recognized as Zaslovsky.\r\n\r\nSitting on the edge of the seat I could see that we had entered a broad\r\navenue; shortly on the left I saw a church. Proceeding into another\r\nbroad avenue, there was a chimney visible behind a wooden fence at the\r\nend of which the carriage stopped. I saw a short distance away another\r\nchurch. It was the view of this church that remained in my memory that\r\nday as I entered the Ipatiev House.\r\n\r\nTrembling with fear we were eager to reach the premises. At the arch\r\nof some sort of a porte-cochere we stepped out from the carriage. It\r\nwas 9:40 A.M. or perhaps a little later when we entered the Ipatiev\r\ngate. At the entrance stood Goloshchekin, the Commissar. Olga entered\r\nfirst and we followed her. As we entered the house, we were met by\r\na rough-looking man who stood in the vestibule. From here we were\r\nescorted through a wide stairway and entered an anteroom and then\r\npassed into another room which was the Commissar’s office. We each had\r\nto present, separately, our identity cards, each with its serial number\r\nand photograph of the bearer, taken in Tobolsk some time earlier. They\r\nshowed the place and date of birth, surname, patronymic and family\r\nname, as well as our address at Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nWe found Father standing near the hallway at the foot of the stairway.\r\nHe threw his arms around us. Then Alexei was placed in Father’s arms.\r\nMother and Marie met us at the threshold. We sobbed in each other’s\r\narms, but when Alexei was brought to Mother, she put her head on his\r\nchest and wept bitterly. “My baby, my precious one!” It was nice to\r\nhear again these words which had been missing in Tobolsk. Joy and\r\nsorrow mingled in that tragic reunion.\r\n\r\nMother looked pale, haggard, and prematurely aged. Even Marie had lost\r\nher glow. Father’s once clear blue eyes were circled with dark shadows\r\nand his hair was sprinkled with gray. His hands were thin and I noticed\r\ndark spots on them. “It is his liver,” Dr. Botkin said. Marie gave her\r\nbed to Alexei. In Father’s and Mother’s room were the three folding\r\nbeds which had been brought from Tobolsk. We four sisters moved into\r\none room.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, our cook Kharitonov, his helper Leonid Sidniev\r\nand the valet Trup were brought to us. They told us they had been\r\nquestioned for hours. Their interrogators stripped them of their extra\r\nclothing and took some of their belongings. The interrogators had not\r\nforgotten the unpleasant incident which took place on the boat, where\r\nNagorny exchanged angry words over Alexei’s being locked up overnight\r\nin his cabin. They told us that General Tatishchev, Countess Hendrikova\r\nand Mlle. Schneider had been arrested and taken away to prison. But\r\nthey were unable to find out what had become of Dr. Derevenko, M.\r\nGilliard, Buxhoeveden, Tegleva, Ersberg, Father’s valet Kirpichnikov\r\nand the others. Our money, including our household money, carried by\r\nGeneral Tatishchev, had been taken away from him. Now we had nothing\r\nleft. Father wrote to Voykov asking of what these people were guilty to\r\nbe sent to prison.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these unpleasant incidents we were glad and pleasantly\r\nsurprised to have these few friends with us again. Mother was thankful\r\nto have these men, since Father’s old valet Chemodurov had been taken\r\nill as a result of the trip from Tobolsk and sent to a hospital. On the\r\nday after our arrival it was our turn to be searched. Our suitcases\r\nwere opened and ransacked. Fortunately we had brought with us little\r\nclothing. My shoes were almost worn out. While on the boat, Iza\r\nBuxhoeveden promised to let me have a pair of her own shoes. She wore\r\nsize 4½, the same as I. But she was forbidden to give me hers.\r\n\r\nThe trunks which were shipped from Tobolsk reached the house but they\r\nwere taken directly to the attic. We heard banging above the dining\r\nroom and the sitting room. Evidently they had taken the keys to our\r\ntrunks from General Tatishchev when they arrested him and were removing\r\nour belongings.\r\n\r\nSeveral times they asked Olga to play the piano, which was in Commissar\r\nYurovsky’s room. There we recognized our table linens, on one occasion\r\na large one with the double eagle and the crown woven in it, and also\r\none embroidered in the center with the double eagle and the crown.\r\nCommissar Yurovsky also helped himself to Father’s clothes which were\r\nmuch too tight and too short for him.\r\n\r\nWith all our troubles Olga became ill again with a nervous stomach\r\ndisorder and suffered excruciating pain. Mother and Father and Marie\r\nhad a small wardrobe when they first came to Ekaterinburg, but most of\r\ntheir clothes were in their trunks. One misfortune followed another\r\nin rapid succession. To add to our distress, Alexei knocked his knee\r\nagainst the bed while trying to get up. At first he fainted and after\r\nsome minutes the pain became unbearable. An internal hemorrhage caused\r\nhim untold suffering, with no immediate relief or medical help.\r\nFinally, after several letters to Yurovsky and pleading by Dr. Botkin,\r\nDr. Derevenko was allowed to administer medical treatment. Mother\r\nspoke to the doctor while he attended Alexei, but he gave no reply.\r\nThe guards were at the door watching him. He looked pale and his hands\r\nshook. When he did not respond to Mother’s question, she realized that\r\nhe was under strict orders not to speak to us. Mother was so upset by\r\nthese events that she burst into tears. The doctor’s face turned red\r\nand he looked at her pleadingly. He gave her some lotion, salve, clean\r\ngauze and epinephrine as Tatiana took charge of Alexei. Dr. Derevenko\r\nsaluted and left like a shadow or a dream that comes and goes. Tatiana\r\nwas to apply the compresses of epinephrine to my brother’s knee. When\r\nthe cotton was used up, she washed the gauze and saved it, and when\r\nthat too was gone, she used Father’s old shirts or our old blouses. For\r\nweeks Alexei suffered. He lost a great deal of weight and became weak.\r\nNot only was his knee stiff, but this time both feet were partially\r\nparalyzed and one leg somehow became shorter again. Nevertheless, Dr.\r\nDerevenko was forbidden to take care of his young patient. We were\r\nnot able to use the foam apparatus. The instruments were in a trunk\r\nin the hallway but were useless because most of the time there was no\r\nelectricity and very little hot water. This was the only trunk that\r\nwas turned over to us--because nothing was in it that those cruel men\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nIt became apparent that the new life we dreamed of and the new hope\r\nthat ran through us were being mocked at every turn. Restrictions and\r\ndistrust teamed together to destroy our morale. We four sisters shared\r\none bedroom. The first days we slept on the bare floor covered with\r\nblankets and a conglomeration of coats and cushions, as the house had\r\nbeen stripped of rugs and carpets. The floor was cold and damp. Olga\r\nand Tatiana became so thin their bones ached from sleeping on the hard\r\nfloor. I was well padded then and felt less discomfort than the others.\r\nAfter a while we received heavy mattresses made of sacking stuffed with\r\nstraw. These had to be turned over every day creating much dust and\r\nmaking my Mother’s sinus worse.\r\n\r\nWe sisters were frightened and agreed among ourselves that one of us\r\nshould keep watch at night as we had done during the last days at\r\nTobolsk, lying down during the day on our parents’ beds to make up for\r\nlost sleep.\r\n\r\nMarie described to us their treacherous trip from Tobolsk to Tiumen. As\r\nthey were crossing the Irtysh River in _tarantasy_, the ice, which was\r\nmany feet thick, began to break up with a thunderous noise, so much so\r\nthat even the sharpshooters and officers who were escorting the family\r\nunder Rodionov’s surveillance were frightened.\r\n\r\nThe horses struggled in the thick slush which came up to their\r\nstomachs. Unable to raise their feet they merely pushed the slush ahead\r\nof them. Large pieces of ice wedged between the wheels, causing the\r\nspokes to break. In front of Rasputin’s house, a crack like thunder\r\nwas heard underneath and a huge block of ice heaved close to them. One\r\nof the horses fell and could not get up and it took the efforts of all\r\nthe guards to lift him to his feet with the aid of a wooden plank.\r\nWhat Rasputin had predicted ran through Marie’s mind: that our family\r\nwould visit his village and that our death would follow his death. When\r\nMother saw that Marie was frightened, she tried to brace her up.\r\n\r\nHorses had to be changed a number of times before Tiumen was reached.\r\nFather, Dr. Botkin, and Prince Dolgorukov got out and walked in the\r\nmarsh to lighten the burden of the horses which were wet, steaming\r\nand foaming at the mouth. In the evening the party was put up at a\r\npeasant’s cottage where some tea and food was served. Mother’s clothes\r\nwere wet; she was so cold that her teeth were chattering and her lips\r\nwere blue.\r\n\r\nAfter resuming their trip, Father recognized one of his generals going\r\nin the opposite direction, dressed in peasant garb. Their eyes met.\r\nNeither one spoke. During this trip Dr. Botkin became ill, but in spite\r\nof that they had to continue their trip during the night, because the\r\nriver did not thaw as rapidly at night. Finally they arrived at a point\r\nnear Tiumen early in the morning.\r\n\r\nHere part of the ice had already melted near the banks of the river,\r\nand it became necessary for them to put up a temporary bridge in order\r\nto cross the opening between the ice and the shore. Although it was\r\nearly in the morning--just after daybreak--all kinds of guards were\r\nthere to meet them, only a few of whom spoke Russian. The rest seemed\r\nto be foreigners. Under a heavy escort of soldiers armed with guns\r\nand hand grenades suspended from their belts, they were taken to the\r\nrailroad station. Here they boarded a train. The entire party was\r\nseated in one car with Father, Mother and Marie on one side and the\r\nothers on the other side. These included Prince Dolgorukov, Dr. Botkin,\r\nChemodurov, Father’s old valet, Anna Demidova and Sidniev--once a\r\nfootman to us girls. The family was not allowed to speak to any one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor four whole days the train was shuttled back and forth by Yakovlev,\r\nwho had charge of the family and was sympathetic to Father. He feared\r\nthat when they reached Moscow, if Father should refuse to comply with\r\ntheir demands, the entire family would be killed. Father was puzzled\r\nat Yakovlev’s changes as to going or not going to Moscow. But soon the\r\nfamily recognized that Yakovlev was against those traitors in Moscow,\r\nbut he was helpless, knowing that Father would not leave Russia,\r\nespecially not leave his family to the mercy of these cruel men. The\r\nGermans were in control in Moscow and Father was convinced that all\r\norders concerning our family came from Count Mirbach. Yakovlev’s\r\npurpose, therefore, was to forestall this. The train itself was even\r\nset on fire in order to give the prisoners a chance to escape. Father\r\nwould not take advantage of this, as the rest of the family would have\r\nbeen held in Tobolsk as hostages. Soon thereafter Yakovlev received\r\norders to proceed to Ekaterinburg. They spent Palm Sunday on the train.\r\n\r\nAs they were approaching Ekaterinburg a Commissar came asking for\r\ntheir papers. Father had only an identification card he always carried\r\nin his billfold of light leather embossed with a crown in gold. It\r\nbore his name, the date and the place of his birth, his religion and\r\nmarital status. It also indicated the issuing office: the Imperial\r\ndesk. In addition he had the identification card that had been issued\r\nto him at Tobolsk, which contained his picture and the words: Nicholas\r\nAlexandrovich Romanov, ex-Emperor, Citizen, Tsarskoe Selo.\r\n\r\nIn Ekaterinburg a photograph of the whole party of five was taken by\r\nCommissars Sverdlov and Goloshchekin, both Jews. Near the station at\r\nEkaterinburg the people on the street went down on their knees and\r\nkissed the ground on which my family passed. They were guarded by the\r\nsame men who came with them on the train, plus some additional guards\r\nwho now surrounded them. Upon entering the house each gave his name and\r\nwas admitted, but when Prince Dolgorukov gave his name the Commissar\r\nsaid: “You are under arrest.” This beloved friend of many years with\r\nwhom Father had played during his childhood, was now separated from\r\nthem. Prince Dolgorukov pulled out of his pocket one of his general’s\r\nepaulettes which had been removed from his uniform in Tobolsk. He\r\nhanded it to Father and said: “It came from my Emperor and I give it\r\nback to my Emperor.” There was no chance to shake hands. He saluted\r\nFather and said, “God be with You, Your Majesties.” He was taken\r\naway.... Father was so shaken by this incident, he wrote a note to\r\nGoloshchekin, who was in charge of all prisoners, but it was fruitless.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock in the morning a great mob of people gathered outside\r\nthe house. Several shots were fired. From the screams they knew some\r\nwere killed. The guards then entered and made a thorough search of the\r\nhouse. They took Father’s money and Mother’s jewelry and stripped all\r\nthe others, including the maid, of their valuables. Anna Demidova had\r\nall her savings with her and also jewelry given to her by the family\r\nover the years. A foreigner who spoke to Mother in German and to Father\r\nin French, although he understood Russian, was insulting. It was said\r\nthat he was Yurovsky’s, Trotsky’s and Mirbach’s friend, and that he was\r\nsent to the Ipatiev House from Moscow as a connoisseur of antiquities\r\nfor a Swiss firm. His name started with “K”. Father resented this\r\ntreatment and said that up to now he had been accustomed to deal with\r\nhonest men, and that he did not need to be reminded by a foreigner that\r\nhe was a prisoner not of his own people, but of traitors, convicts and\r\nforeign agents. It is unbelievable that such men could come into our\r\ncountry and wrest all power from the people.\r\n\r\nThe guards were Russians whose orders came from foreigners in Moscow.\r\nEven though most of the guards were ex-convicts, they could see the\r\ninjustice that was being done. And sooner or later they began to be\r\nmore lenient. But immediately the change in their attitude was noticed,\r\nthey were replaced by new recruits.\r\n\r\nSuch was Marie’s account of their trip and stay in Ekaterinburg.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Kharitonov, our chief cook; Trup, the valet; and Leonid\r\nSidniev, the 14-year-old kitchen helper, cheered somewhat the gloomy\r\natmosphere. When Dr. Botkin met us, he threw his arms around us and\r\nkissed each one of us, as if we were his own children. Tears filled\r\nhis eyes. In less than a month he had greatly changed, as had all the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nFather’s knuckles were swollen with arthritis. His kidney condition\r\ncaused excruciating back pains. Mother’s hands too were swollen more\r\nthan before and the lump on the index finger of her right hand was\r\nquite noticeable. She no longer could hold a needle in her fingers. All\r\nthis was due to the very difficult trip from Tobolsk and the mental\r\nagony which persisted.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin’s sad eyes forced a smile, beneath the swollen bags under\r\nthem. His pastime was limited to reading. The dear man was anxious\r\nfor news of his children, but we had none to offer, except a few\r\nindefinite rumors we had heard on the boat. In spite of the surrounding\r\nterrors, Dr. Botkin continued to reflect his intelligence, kindness\r\nand tenderness. Why should dear “Papula” be punished? I remember his\r\nchildren called him that. Commissar Yurovsky was especially abusive\r\nto him, Dr. Botkin wished his children to be brought to Ekaterinburg.\r\nHe begged Commissars Avdiev and Yurovsky to have this done but the\r\nrequest was denied. Fortunately, by not coming to Ekaterinburg, they\r\nescaped the tragedy that befell their father. This seemed so unnatural\r\nsince Yurovsky was the father of three children, and the son of a\r\nJewish rabbi. One would think that he would be kind to other children.\r\n\r\nUp to now our parents had had their food prepared outside. But when\r\nKharitonov arrived, he resumed his duties as our cook. In the beginning\r\nwe were allowed fifteen minutes each day to walk in the small, muddy\r\ngarden; soon the grass began to show signs of life and the fragrant\r\nlilacs began to bloom. We were permitted to take some violets and\r\nlilacs to Mother, but they had to be examined at the office before they\r\nwere taken into our apartments. A few trees showed considerable abuse,\r\nas the horses had chewed off much of the bark on the white birch and\r\npoplar trees. We picked the blossoms of the linden tree, dried them\r\nand used them to make tea. There was always something fragrant in the\r\ngarden; when the acacia was in bloom the fragrance seeped through the\r\nwindows. Sometimes Mother went out with us in the yard, when Alexei\r\nwas feeling better. After Nagorny was taken away and when Father was\r\nill, Dr. Botkin or Marie carried Alexei down into the garden. One day\r\nwhen Dr. Botkin carried him, Alexei threw his arms around his neck and\r\nkissed this good friend on both cheeks in gratitude. During our walking\r\nexercises we were subjected to the watchful eyes of the guards. They\r\nall carried hand grenades in their belts. Some of these were good men,\r\nbut none stayed more than a few days. Once we heard them say, “Where\r\nthere are devils, there is Hell, and that is what we have now.”\r\n\r\nOur window panes had been painted white outside, except for a tiny\r\nspace at the top through which we could glimpse the blue sky. After a\r\nwhile Father wrote Yurovsky asking him to remove enough paint so that\r\nwe could see the thermometer which was on the left side of the window\r\nframe outside. We saw nothing but walls, prison walls.\r\n\r\nAlexei asked Father to request that M. Gilliard be returned to us.\r\nThis too was denied. Alexei also asked Father how long we would have to\r\nstay in this place. Father could not help but tell the truth, “It might\r\nbe long.” Alexei never brought up that question again.\r\n\r\nSometimes at night shots would be heard; an agonized cry, then quiet.\r\nThey searched our house again. We sisters were still without beds. They\r\ntold us to set our clocks ahead by two hours. We had our breakfast at\r\n12:30 noon. Kharitonov had to work not only for us and our staff but\r\nalso for these terrible men. The odors of fish and other good-smelling\r\nthings would drift to our rooms, but they were not for us. These\r\nfoods were for the Commandant and the guards. We were given a thin\r\nfish soup or half-cooked veal cutlet at noon and a cold one at night.\r\nFather could not eat these things, so he went frequently without food.\r\nMother’s meals consisted usually of spaghetti and tea, which little\r\nLeonid prepared for her over a small kerosene burner, because she\r\nrefused to sit at the same table with those vulgar men. The guards ate\r\nat the same table with the family. For us, it was a question of eating\r\nthe revolting stuff or starving while the guards lived off the fat of\r\nthe land at our expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII DEPRIVATION AND COURAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery week Father was questioned in the Commissar’s room, while the\r\nguards stood by at the doorway of our rooms. One day Father returned\r\nvery upset after being questioned for two hours. They showed him a war\r\ndocument, the “Orange Book” as it was called, from which a number of\r\ndocuments were missing and accused Father of destroying these documents\r\nand substituting a letter from the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria,\r\nin which he wrote to Father that he did not wish to acquire any\r\nterritory, but to die in peace in his old age. They ignored the fact\r\nthat these documents had been held at the Ministry of War after they\r\nhad been read by Father and the General Staff. Their suspicions were\r\nbased on the assumption that it was impossible for the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph to have written such a letter.\r\n\r\nWe had no privacy, not even the privacy of a prison. All the doors of\r\nour rooms had been removed before we arrived at the Ipatiev House. At\r\nany time of the day or night the guards or the Commandant would stalk\r\ninto our rooms, without knocking. This occurred about every three\r\nhours for their check-up. The stench of liquor that flooded the rooms\r\nwarned us of their approach. They sat on Alexei’s bed. They drank from\r\nour tumblers. They stuffed into their pockets anything that caught\r\ntheir eye. They came in twos or threes. By this time we had kept only\r\nour most treasured keepsakes, so whatever they helped themselves to\r\nwas a real loss to us. But even precious things were worth losing if\r\nthey would but leave us alone without this constant intrusion. They\r\nkept coming in more often, flaunting their authority in our faces,\r\njoking at our expense, and toying with the veneer of our composure.\r\nBy comparison, the first guards at Tobolsk were gentlemen. We could\r\nnot believe these creatures were soldiers. They seemed too uncouth to\r\nhave been in any service of the Army. At night their hideous brawlings\r\nreached us from their quarters below to fill us with disgust and\r\nterror. Dr. Botkin tried to intercede. He went to the Commandant and\r\nurged him to see that his men were less rowdy, but they continued to\r\nact as before. Father seldom spoke to the Commissars. Anything he\r\nneeded he wrote down and handed it to his valet Trup to deliver to\r\nYurovsky.\r\n\r\nIn cases of illness, Dr. Botkin took care of us on his own accord. We\r\nsisters at home were trained not to be familiar with anyone around us,\r\nand always to be reserved. Mother also spoke seldom to her help, except\r\nwhen giving orders; and yet she was very kind to those who were in\r\ntrouble or in need. Mother was the first one to help them financially.\r\nAnd now when Anna Demidova lost all her belongings Mother promised to\r\nreplace their losses to all who were in our service.\r\n\r\nOnce when Kharitonov was ill, we sisters undertook the task of\r\npreparing the food. One day a burlap sack of potatoes was brought to\r\nthe kitchen. “Peel them,” said one of the guards. Potatoes! Something\r\nso real, so much a part of the earth, to hold in our hands. We fondled\r\neach one, breathing in its earthy smell; no perfume like it. We made a\r\ngame out of paring and when we finished, there was only a small pile of\r\npeelings. It was a refreshing task. We assumed some of these would be\r\nfor our meals, but no potatoes were served to us. We helped on another\r\noccasion in the kitchen, baking bread. Kharitonov was appreciative of\r\nour help, since he had lately been in poor health, and the task of\r\ncooking for so many, commissars and others as well as for us, was too\r\nmuch for him.\r\n\r\nTwice a week two maids came in to care for our rooms. They cleaned,\r\nwashed the floors and changed our bedding. We helped them all we could\r\nand were glad to see the new faces about. We could not converse with\r\nthem, because the guards stood at the doorway wherever they worked. We\r\nsaw their frightened faces. We understood and they applied themselves\r\nto the execution of their strict orders. Upon entering our rooms and\r\nagain on leaving they were searched. But somehow these women managed to\r\ntell us that some of our friends had been imprisoned and some shot.\r\n\r\nNow we utilized a code using verses of the Bible. While the women\r\nworked, Mother or one of us sisters was told to read certain verses\r\nfrom St. John. We hoped the maids understood that she was to\r\ncommunicate with someone on the outside. The next time she came to\r\nclean she merely raised one or two of her fingers. We thought that\r\nsomeone had been interviewed and had suggested that we read Chapter 1\r\nor Chapter 2. Another time we understood we were expected to read other\r\nchapters of the Bible. In that way we thought we were in touch with\r\nsomeone on the outside. We did this when conditions became dangerous.\r\nIt was the only hope we believed might save us at the crucial moment.\r\nBut if any of these messages reached anyone outside we did not know it.\r\n\r\nWe knew that food was being delivered to the house from the neighboring\r\nmonastery every other day, for our family use. However, very seldom\r\ndid any of this food reach us. The Commissars took most of it for\r\nthemselves. During our meals Avdiev sat at our table and so did the\r\nguards. At such times the food was much better. Our few remaining\r\nservants felt uncomfortable sitting at the same table with us, and they\r\nasked Dr. Botkin to speak to Father about it Father made it easier for\r\nthem by saying: “We are all in the same boat, and if we are to sink\r\nwe might as well sink together.” They were exceedingly sympathetic\r\nand showed us more kindness. We could read the grief in their faces,\r\nbut they were as brave as the rest of us. Trup and Kharitonov were\r\napproached by Voykov to cook for them at the club outside, a home of\r\nthe Commissars. In spite of Kharitonov’s wife and a daughter being\r\nin Ekaterinburg, both refused, and preferred to work for their old\r\nemployers without compensation. In response to Mother’s anguished\r\nprayers, Alexei began to feel better now. One day, Yurovsky came in\r\nand said abruptly, “Alexei is better now. He does not need Nagorny any\r\nlonger.” Poor Nagorny was taken away. This faithful Ukrainian had done\r\nno more than serve his young master faithfully. Also our young footman\r\nSidniev was taken away.\r\n\r\nWhat was left of our silver disappeared gradually, except for a few\r\nforks and spoons which we kept in our rooms. Most of our silver had\r\nbeen seized from us in Tsarskoe Selo during the Kerensky regime. Part\r\nof it was repurchased by my two older sisters from their savings and\r\npart was purchased by Count Benckendorff who gave it back to us.\r\n\r\nAt meal time these wretched guards monopolized the conversation with\r\nall kinds of jokes. Their table manners were atrocious and their\r\nappetites voracious. One of the guards leaned against Dr. Botkin to\r\nlight his cigarette from the candle which stood in the center of the\r\ntable. His sleeve got into the food, and I without a thought gave him\r\nmy napkin. The man actually looked ashamed. But as time wore on, we\r\nthought we could notice an improvement in the attitude of the guards.\r\nSome became tolerant and a few were even friendly. During one of our\r\nwalks in the garden one of these men spoke so that Father could hear\r\nhim say, “How cruel and senseless to hold and abuse an innocent man.”\r\nThis guard suddenly disappeared, as did others. Every day there were\r\nnew arrivals to replace those who were being sent away, for showing\r\nsympathy for us, which no doubt worried Yurovsky.\r\n\r\nAt night we tried to create a homelike atmosphere by lighting candles\r\non the table. These nourished our souls, even if the food did not\r\nnourish our bodies. But we were told to burn one candle at a time, or\r\none kerosene lamp. So for a long time we did burn only one candle.\r\nOften we were compelled to sit in the dark or go to bed early.\r\nElectricity was off most of the time. There were promises that it would\r\nbe fixed tomorrow, but tomorrow never came and we never saw electric\r\nlights again.\r\n\r\nAmong our household dishes, Kharitonov had a box of gold candles. When\r\nthe men searched the kitchen they became suspicious and melted some of\r\nthe candles but found nothing.\r\n\r\nYurovsky had an office in the house. This consisted of an impressive\r\ndesk and community bed covered with a military blanket, on which he and\r\nothers took turns resting their troubled heads. The room, dirty and\r\nfilled with cigarette butts, became a human pigsty. A samovar graced\r\na table, many glasses of tea were consumed. A German newspaper rested\r\nmajestically by the samovar. There was also a pointed knife with a\r\nblack horn handle, a special culinary tool with which Yurovsky had\r\nproudly speared his cutlet at the supper table and expertly carried it\r\nstraight into his mouth, profusely decorated with a curly, bushy black\r\nbeard and mustache. In the corners of his protruding mouth there was an\r\naccumulation of saliva which never experienced a lonely hour. A dish\r\nwith a mound of fresh butter was replaced as soon as it was finished.\r\nWe long ago had forgotten the taste of butter. Since his last cold, the\r\ndoctor had prescribed this diet for Yurovsky’s weak chest. This brute\r\neven looked for sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe table was covered with an elegant damask table cloth with a woven\r\ndouble eagle and a crown in the center. We also recognized Prince\r\nDolgorukov’s handkerchiefs, presumably taken away from him during his\r\narrest. His coat of arms displayed a hand holding an arrow. Dolgorukov\r\nmeans “long arm.”\r\n\r\nFrequently the guards asked Olga to play the balalaika or the piano,\r\nfor their amusement. Sometimes she played her own compositions. Father\r\ncould but consent so long as the pieces were not construed to have a\r\ndouble meaning. Whatever the guards ordered we complied with, thankful\r\nfor an occasional moment when they occupied themselves with something\r\nconstructive. But when they insisted that Olga sing “We Abandon the\r\nOld Regime,” she stood up and in a firm tone said, “I will not do it,\r\neven if you kill me.” Surprised they were at her courage. Once when she\r\nplayed _Andante Contabule_ by Tchaikovsky, they screamed “No” at the\r\ntop of their voices. “It is sad, play something else, please.” Then\r\nshe played a war song, “He Died in the War Hospital.” “No, no, please\r\nstop it; it is sad too, play something else.” Cheerfulness they were\r\nseeking at the hands of those who long ago had forgotten the meaning\r\nof a happy mood. Father always stood at the doorway when anyone of us\r\nplayed or sang for them. But Mother was never left alone. This habit we\r\nhad formed at Tsarskoe Selo. No matter what we did one of us remained\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nIt had become a regular thing to search our quarters, not so much for\r\nvaluables, since by now they had already taken an inventory of them, as\r\nfor possible means of escape. Each day there was a fresh excuse. They\r\nconstantly suspected us of having something incriminating. They heard\r\nthat we had guns hidden, they would say. No matter what the answer was,\r\na whole troop of them would stalk in. Each day’s experience sharpened\r\nour detective powers. We could see without looking. Every time they\r\nstole we sensed it. We saw them take our silver spoons, pencils, soap\r\nand other articles. They removed everything they saw and slipped them\r\nup their sleeves. They took apart a picture with a heavy enamel frame\r\nwith the excuse that the frame might have something hidden in it.\r\nUnderneath they found a photograph of Mother’s beloved brother Ernest.\r\nWith all the persecution she had feared to display her brother’s\r\nphotograph. So she covered it with one of our pictures. They said\r\nnothing. Even we had not known that her brother’s picture was hidden\r\nunderneath. They also took a gold chain with an icon which hung over\r\nAlexei’s bed. We never made any effort to stop them, nor did we give\r\nany sign that we saw. We ignored their thievery and curiosity since\r\nFather said: “We must not let them know how much they annoy us; soon\r\nthey will grow tired and leave us alone.”\r\n\r\nAfter much argument and after waiting for over two weeks, Dr. Botkin\r\nwas able to persuade Yurovsky to have a window opened in one of the\r\nrooms for ventilation. They unlatched two other windows, then accused\r\nus of unlatching them. We sisters moved our mattresses for the night\r\ncloser to that window for a breath of air. Father’s and Mother’s beds\r\nwere also moved closer to our room, where there was only one window\r\nopen, and where near by was the guard booth. We felt sorry for Dr.\r\nBotkin, Sidniev, Trup and Nagorny. They had no privacy. They shared the\r\nsame room with doors removed and at one end was the staircase which\r\nwas used by the guards to go downstairs. The room had two opposite\r\ndoors, one leading through a hall into one side and the other into\r\nthe apartment on the other side; Nagorny and Sidniev had been taken\r\naway in the beginning of June before the heat became unbearable. Poor\r\nKharitonov and little Leonid had slept in the hot kitchen.\r\n\r\nOur days were irregular although we arose regularly at eight in the\r\nmorning. Before breakfast we held a service and sang a prayer in our\r\nroom. Father, Mother, Dr. Botkin and all the rest joined us for a half\r\nhour of prayer and meditation. These were the most pleasant moments of\r\nthe day, because our friends were with us at this hour.\r\n\r\nMother worried more about Alexei, since he had grown steadily worse\r\nwith the small amount of nourishment he had. Now all the supply of\r\ntissue-building ingredients was gone from his diet. The Commandant\r\nwould not heed Dr. Botkin’s plea for the food necessary to his\r\nwell-being--gelatine, vegetables and fruit. The saintly “Papula” (Dr.\r\nBotkin) begged Yurovsky to be generous to the sick boy, but to no\r\navail. Father also wrote to Yurovsky, but this too was ignored by him.\r\nAll this tension reacted on Mother’s heart. She had grown much weaker\r\nand her lips, when blue, warned us of a heart attack.\r\n\r\nFather looked desperate, because he could do nothing to spare his\r\nchildren. We knew he himself could stand anything for Russia,\r\nanything but the persecution of his family. Only occasionally did his\r\nhopelessness come to the surface, though he tried to disguise it from\r\nus. With us sisters low spirits rotated from one to another. Each lived\r\nfor the other. Father knew everything that went on in our hearts and\r\noften told us what we were thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV THE NIGHTS ARE LONG\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a sad moment when we heard that Nagorny and Sidniev had been\r\ntaken away. Without any notice they were ordered to get ready in a\r\nfew moments time. Dr. Botkin told us that both men wanted to see us\r\nbefore they left. Nagorny said, “I am employed by my Emperor and I am\r\ngoing to see him.” But he was rudely pushed toward the stairway. Poor\r\nLeonid lost his only relative, his uncle Sidniev, who had devoted his\r\nlife to this little orphaned boy. Now Leonid, the scullery boy, took\r\nthe responsibility of taking care of our dogs. It was a great treat\r\nnot only to Alexei but to the family to see someone who had been with\r\nus in Tobolsk. Leonid’s smiling face brought some diversion to Alexei,\r\nbut Leonid too was a prisoner in the house, like the rest of us. The\r\ntwo boys played navy games with toy boats and so were able momentarily\r\nto forget the existing conditions surrounding us. Since Leonid was an\r\norphan, Alexei’s ambition was to give him the best possible education\r\nand care for him as long as he would be in need.\r\n\r\nNow that Nagorny was gone, Father himself carried Alexei down into the\r\ncourtyard for his daily airing of thirty minutes. Father’s tenderness\r\nchoked us afresh each time. All the time it was evident to us that\r\nFather was buckling under the weight of his own injured back. We\r\nhad little heart to go out at all into a cheerful courtyard full of\r\nheartless men. The thirty minutes airing was hardly worth the strain\r\non Father, but the fresh air was medicine to Alexei, until God would\r\nanswer our prayers.\r\n\r\nWe did not take the wheel chair down into the garden. Mother wanted\r\nAlexei to walk a little each day. We took turns holding him under the\r\narms; his legs were so weak they would have collapsed under him without\r\nsupport. Dr. Botkin thought that braces on both legs would help. The\r\nrubber had gone to pieces on the braces he had been using. Olga and\r\nTatiana took stays, hooks, and other parts of our corsets and made two\r\nbraces that hooked in front. Not having any rubber, they padded these\r\nwith cotton placed between two pieces of cloth. These proved to be\r\neffective and Alexei was able to go outdoors wearing these braces under\r\nhis trousers.\r\n\r\nOnce when we walked around the courtyard some birds made a commotion.\r\nIn my mind I wondered if they came from the Crimea. One little fellow\r\nwarbled on so eternally that we were lifted as by a religious service.\r\nFrom then on we listened hungrily, each songster seeming a harbinger of\r\nthat world so shut away from us.\r\n\r\nNow our walks were cut down to fifteen minutes. The time was so short\r\nthat it seemed we were back in the house at the moment of leaving! Olga\r\nused to say, “Back into the vault.”\r\n\r\nMother seldom went out with us but, on our return, she eagerly drank\r\nin the sweet air that still clung to our clothes. There were a few\r\nways left for us to amuse ourselves but these had grown monotonous.\r\nOur books, which had been taken away from us on our arrival, were now\r\nrestored and we read them but our thoughts were far away.\r\n\r\nFather read the Bible aloud, often starting on the page at which he\r\nopened the book. We girls had our tapestries, but the lack of yarn and\r\nthe bad light caused us to give up working on them. Mother no longer\r\nsewed, her eyes being bad from the inadequate light of our lone candle.\r\nIt was too much of a strain.\r\n\r\nAlexei no longer had his toy soldiers, the guards having seized\r\nthem some time earlier. Now he passed many hours cutting out paper\r\nsoldiers with his little friend Leonid--lining them up in formation on\r\nthe squares of a chessboard. We sisters helped to design different\r\nuniforms and color them. Anything to help the boys forget the dreary\r\nhours. The guards leaned over the boys’ shoulders commenting on the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nFather wrote Yurovsky requesting a priest to come and hold a service.\r\nAfter a long debate with Dr. Botkin, one of the Commissars came at\r\nlast to inform us that, on the next day, a priest would come to hold\r\na service in the house, the first one in Ekaterinburg. Mother was\r\necstatic. We selected our choice icons and, with the help of our\r\nfriends, we put up in the sitting room a small altar, a table covered\r\nwith a hand-embroidered cloth. With the coming of the priest and the\r\nservice a little light crept into the Ipatiev House.\r\n\r\nJust before the service began, Alexei’s bed was brought into the room.\r\nHe had been suffering from the cold as well as from swollen hands and\r\nlegs partially paralyzed from his knees down. Yurovsky leered at us\r\nfrom one corner of the room but we ignored him. The priest’s voice\r\ntrembled. He was upset for fear of making a mistake, probably knowing\r\nthe fate of Father Vassiliev in Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nIt was an inspirational day; the simple ritual, the chanting, the\r\nCommunion and its consummation, our lips kissed the cross, and our\r\nsouls feasted on the Blessed Bread. Exaltation swept through us and\r\nwe soared to an enveloping oneness with God. Father read the Holy\r\nScripture and we all sang. What a day it was!\r\n\r\nAfter the service Mother said: “The priest and the deacon seemed so\r\nsad. Priests are in great danger these days. I pray they get into no\r\ntrouble for coming to the house.”\r\n\r\nDid the guards feel as we felt that day? They did not interfere with\r\nour taking Holy Communion. God’s hand was upon us and we felt safer.\r\nThe world of prison and persecution was not real. We had glimpsed the\r\nreal world, that world where our souls were filled and a new life\r\nflowed into our withering flesh. Mother kept repeating: “The Communion\r\nhas been such a healer.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the influence of this Communion service which gave us\r\nan inspiration. We girls put our heads together and wrote a prayer of\r\nseven verses, one for each member of the family. We memorized each\r\nverse completely so that we could destroy the written copy in order to\r\nkeep the prayer to ourselves. We agreed that if we were ever separated,\r\nwe could communicate with each other by using one or more of the verses\r\nas a sort of unwritten code. We were delighted with the idea and worked\r\non its composition, each member contributing. Olga put the prayer\r\ntogether in its final form. Then we memorized it verse by verse. When\r\neveryone had mastered the prayer we tore into the tiniest bits the\r\npaper on which the prayer was written and disposed of them, a little at\r\na time, every day. Six verses of the prayer follow:\r\n\r\n    Our Father of all men, Giver of our lives,\r\n    In our saddest, stormy hour of this day,\r\n    We stand at the Gate of our Lord,\r\n    Give Thy courage and nourishment to our innocent bodies.\r\n    Watch over us in the hour of our fate, bathed by our tears.\r\n    Almighty Father, though men may stain their hands in martyr blood,\r\n    Fill our hearts with forgiveness,\r\n    Grant Thy salvation to us--defenseless--\r\n    As we pray for the sickness of the souls who have gone astray.\r\n\r\n    O, Father in Heaven, light up the land of Russia.\r\n    Enlighten her way from darkness to understanding,\r\n    Stretch Thy Blessed hand over those in need of Thy help.\r\n    Lighten their sorrows and heal their wounds.\r\n\r\n    Almighty Father, breathe into us Thy power, Thy strength;\r\n    And when the storm breaks, grant us patience.\r\n    With prayers on our lips, numb the pain in our bodies;\r\n    With compassion, close our eyes with Thy blessed hand forever.\r\n\r\n    When we are no more, open Thy doors to the hungry spirits of our souls.\r\n    Guide them in a prayer to be worthy of Thy Kingdom,\r\n    And grant that we may receive Thy mercy on the day of judgment.\r\n\r\n    Blessed Father, Thou hast bestowed life upon us with the great power of\r\n                                                              Thy hand.\r\n    Grant that, when Thou takest our lives’ spirits to be born free again,\r\n    We may rest in peace in Thy heaven, O blessèd Father of all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV ACCUSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nYurovsky was now getting worse than ever, especially when his men were\r\nnearby. He chose to ignore the insolence of his men when they caught\r\nus washing our glasses after they finished drinking out of them. Dr.\r\nBotkin again tried to intercede but, while Yurovsky pretended to be\r\nshocked, his attitude did not change.\r\n\r\nThe maid came and whispered that Nagorny had been shot a few days after\r\nhe was taken away. She thought Sidniev too had been shot.\r\n\r\nThe Commandants continually fabricated that Father was in touch with\r\nthe outside world, and that Father had written a letter to some person\r\ntelling him how to get into the house. Father had no knowledge whatever\r\nof the layout of the house. From the day we entered the premises all\r\nof us, including Father, were confined to our quarters. We used the\r\nsame stairway every time we went out or returned. We could not even see\r\nthe street because the window panes were painted to make them opaque.\r\nWe heard only the voice of the guard on duty in front of our window,\r\nwho often sang obnoxious songs. There were two tall wooden fences\r\nsurrounding the house, but we did not know their distance from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAnother day, Yurovsky and Goloshchekin told Dr. Botkin that both Father\r\nand Mother knew of an escape plot. Dr. Botkin answered firmly it was\r\nnot true. It had been suggested to us in Tobolsk, but Father refused\r\neven to think of such a thing. Then Yurovsky said that we had been\r\ncommunicating with our friends. For some time our parents were puzzled\r\nbut, after learning that every move they made and every letter they\r\nwrote were known to the authorities in Moscow, they realized that they\r\nwere being betrayed. There was nothing incriminating in their letters\r\nthat were sent from Tobolsk through Markov and Soloviev. They were\r\nnot censored by Colonel Kobylinsky. However, Mother complained in\r\nthose letters about the leaders selling out Russia to the enemy. She\r\nalso expressed her harsh feelings toward the traitors and the crooked\r\nforeign policy that centered in Moscow and said that Father would stand\r\nfirm no matter what the consequences might be.\r\n\r\nOne morning Yurovsky and Voykov appeared with some papers. After making\r\nthemselves comfortable in our sitting room, they called Father’s\r\nattention to photostatic copies of the letters that Mother had written\r\nto Anna Vyrubova and other friends in Tsarskoe Selo and Petrograd.\r\nThere were some letters written to us from Mlle. Fredericks and Mme.\r\nSukhomlinova, the wife of a former Minister of War. These were carried\r\nto and from Tobolsk by Soloviev, husband of Matriona, Rasputin’s oldest\r\ndaughter, who was selected for this mission by Anna Vyrubova.\r\n\r\nThere were also letters purportedly in Mother’s handwriting but which\r\nshe did not write. Voykov said: “You thought Anna, Yaroshinsky, Markov\r\nand Soloviev were your friends. We have photostatic records of all the\r\nletters and activities in Tobolsk.” Father glanced at the photostatic\r\ncopies, recognized Mother’s and Anna’s handwriting. His face turned\r\nwhite and the “Otsu mark” on his forehead became red.\r\n\r\nTo explain this “Otsu mark”: Before his marriage, Father had made a\r\ntour around the world and, on the last lap of his journey, while in\r\nJapan, the Emperor invited him to visit a temple where no Christian\r\nhad ever set foot before. Father rode in a ricksha, followed by Prince\r\nGeorge of Greece and many other rickshas. The road was lined on both\r\nsides by the police. At the end of the line the last policeman struck\r\nFather with his sabre on the head close to the hair line. Father\r\nwas saved by his hat, and the second blow cut his arm with which he\r\ncovered his face. At this moment Father jumped down and ran into a\r\nstore blinded with blood, still followed by the madman. Then Father ran\r\nout of the store pursued by the would-be killer. At this moment Prince\r\nGeorge overtook the latter and knocked him down with his cane. The\r\npolice became confused and clashed sabres among themselves. Fortunately\r\nthe examination by his private physician showed that the wound was not\r\nserious, but it left Father suffering from frequent headaches and with\r\na permanent scar. The family called it the “Otsu scar” or “Otsu mark”.\r\n\r\nWe two younger sisters also knew Yaroshinsky. He was a rich banker and\r\nduring the war, he financed Marie’s and my hospital in Tsarskoe Selo.\r\nOnce he told Marie and me, while at the hospital office, that he had\r\ncome to Russia with his poverty stricken Polish parents to work in the\r\nmines. Marie remarked later, “But where did he get all the money?”\r\nHowever, the conversation had come to an end.\r\n\r\nMother warned Anna to be careful about whom she was sending to Tobolsk.\r\nMoreover, she warned her to destroy all our letters and not to involve\r\npeople not known to us. Anna failed to heed those warnings and in the\r\nend Mother died with a feeling of bitterness toward her well-meaning\r\nbut careless friend. We knew Anna did not do it intentionally but from\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nYurovsky was right. We had been betrayed. Poor Father had had no part\r\nin it. It was clear to us then that the leaders in Moscow knew of\r\nFather’s firmness, but Yakovlev, who was in charge of Father on the\r\ntrain, felt that if Father came to Moscow, he might be persuaded to\r\ncompromise with the leaders--Mirbach, Ludendorff, Lenin, Kamenev and\r\nTrotsky. My Father never would have done anything to harm his people.\r\nFather made Yakovlev understand that he could expect no appeasement\r\nfrom him; that he would rather have his right hand cut off than sign\r\nanything that would harm Russia. He also told Yakovlev that he was\r\nprepared to sacrifice his life for his country. Yakovlev, Father said,\r\nhad telephoned Moscow of Father’s stubbornness. They knew that Father\r\nwas dangerous to them and that his people wanted to have their Emperor\r\nback on the throne. They decided that Father’s presence would ruin\r\ntheir negotiations and that the best thing to do would be to keep him\r\nin Ekaterinburg. Yakovlev however had disobeyed the orders from Moscow\r\nand kept the train that carried Father shuttling back and forth for\r\nfour days till they were finally detained in Ekaterinburg. Yakovlev\r\nhad given Father to understand that he himself was against the foreign\r\ninvaders and the traitors.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his family were clearly not their own masters--they\r\nbelonged to Russia. He was the father of all Russia and the children\r\nwere the children of Russia. He tried to impress his family to be\r\nsimple and not to show importance and conceit, but to be humble and\r\nkind toward the people and serve them in good faith.\r\n\r\nIt was decay and disunity that poisoned and divided the people from\r\nthe Emperor and split the Imperial family into factions. It was not a\r\ncyclone that ripped apart and ravaged the Empire, but a disaster and\r\nrobbery planned from abroad years before by insidious men, and when the\r\nfirst opportunity presented itself, they struck a deadly blow to this\r\ngreat Slavic Empire. How many other great ancient empires suffered the\r\nsame fate--Egypt, Babylon, Persia, Rome, and others. It was an epoch\r\nof short-sightedness on the part of the people who were not able to\r\nsee with their own eyes what the Emperor and Empress saw, and failed\r\nto recognize the accomplishments they had achieved for Russia. But\r\nthey looked blindly in trust to the very ones who were murdering their\r\ncountry before their very eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was hard for the Emperor and his family to die, but it was even\r\nharder for him to die with the knowledge that his death was also\r\nthe death of Russia. He could have saved himself and his family by\r\nsigning the disastrous treaty of Brest-Litovsk, but not he; he could\r\nnot do this to his country, the land he loved beyond all measure. He\r\nwould not do it, even in the moment of the greatest personal danger.\r\nHe never broke his fidelity to the oath that he took on the day of\r\nhis coronation, and he carried this heavy load on his shoulders,\r\ncourageously and uncomplainingly, for more than twenty-two years.\r\nMany people do not see or do not want to see the full extent of\r\nthose demoniacal days; neither do they see the grandeur of the deeds\r\nperformed by this great man, the Emperor Nicholas II.\r\n\r\nMany thought that the Emperor was not powerful enough to bear the\r\nRussian crown. The world did not realize the strength it took to carry\r\nthis burden of representing innumerable races. That alone would have\r\nbroken the stamina of any ordinary man. The Emperor was made a constant\r\nvictim, but the strength, loyalty, and superhuman power which made up\r\nthis man, in contrast, were lacking in his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThose who really knew Father would readily admit that his predominant\r\ncharacteristics were fearlessness, kindness, honesty, loyalty and\r\nfirmness. When he knew he was right, he stood by his convictions. He\r\nwas often called the “Stubborn Tsar.” He disliked gossip and idleness\r\nand refused to listen to those who warned him against his enemies and\r\nspies.\r\n\r\nAn officer who later helped me escape from Russia told me the names of\r\nseveral officers who were involved in actions against Father. There\r\nwere some good names; one was the son of a high Finnish statesman\r\nappointed to his position by Father. The son was an officer and was a\r\ncoward; he feared being wounded. He received money from the Germans to\r\nhelp in the attack against my Father.\r\n\r\nI knew Father for seventeen years of my life, especially closely\r\nduring our imprisonment, when we were together almost every minute of\r\nthe day. His refusal to save himself and his family at the expense\r\nof Russia should be proof enough of his strength and character. When\r\nMoscow pressured him, Father with deep emotion said, “My family and\r\nI will never agree to what they ask me to do, no matter what happens.\r\nAnything they have to say, they should say to me and leave my family\r\nout of it. They have taken everything away from them, their youth and\r\nfreedom, but none of them will yield to German spies and convicts who\r\ndo not represent Russia, and will never forsake the Russian people.”\r\nFather suspected the final outcome. He knew Moscow’s intentions\r\nof discrediting him before his people, but he stood firm in his\r\nrefusal. Even in the hour of danger, he respected his high morals and\r\nobligations. Most of the conversation was conducted through Dr. Botkin.\r\nFather seldom came in contact with these men. It may have been during\r\nthese conversations that Dr. Botkin said to Father, “When I needed your\r\nhelp you were very kind to me, and I have made my mind up never to\r\nleave you as long as I am needed.”\r\n\r\nNow all the hope of freedom vanished, and I often in despair pressed my\r\nbody against the damp wall that held us prisoners, wondering if ever we\r\nwould see the sunshine break through this wall again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI FEAR AND DREAD\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the incident with Yurovsky over the intercepted letters, almost\r\novernight Mother’s hair turned white. She became weak and could hardly\r\nwalk without leaning on someone’s arm. Even when prayer bolstered her\r\nspirit, her hands shook and her voice faded into a whisper. For one\r\nmonth she suffered untold agony, refusing to believe that we had been\r\nbetrayed. Yet she said, “It is God’s Will.” In these words we could\r\nsense her craving for the Holy Communion which brought her the calmness\r\nof God’s spirit. Father would look at her and turn his face aside so\r\nthat his falling tears would not be seen. It was his quiet way of\r\nbearing himself that carried along the rest of us. He dropped his head,\r\nbut not for long. Once more he would hold himself erect, determined to\r\nlook beyond these cruel conditions to the time when Russia would once\r\nmore believe in him and repent. For each other’s sake we tried again\r\nand went through each day with renewed faith in God and hope for the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nHere we never went out to Church. The priest came to us only twice.\r\nWhatever services we had, we held them ourselves. Mother read aloud\r\nfrom the Bible; the rest of us chanted the prayers. We had our own\r\nservice every day. The comfort of the homemade service lifted us all\r\nand gave us satisfaction. Morning, noon and evening we refreshed our\r\nfaith in God. Religion was our nourishment, especially to Mother.\r\nThere is no book as precious as the Bible and nothing will ever be\r\nable to take its place. It is the Word of God and will never die. Even\r\nthe hovering guards listened in quiet, their heads bowed. We were\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nAt last the hard shell of the guards began to crack and out of the\r\ncracks oozed a crude shame. In their rough way they tried to atone for\r\ntheir treatment of us. They extended pity when all we wanted was to be\r\nleft alone. They even gave us some of that by lessening their intrusion\r\ninto our privacy. Mother called it victory--an answer to our prayers.\r\nBut when it was discovered that they were becoming lenient, they were,\r\nmuch to our sorrow, promptly removed. The last part of June or the\r\nbeginning of July they were replaced by the toughest, lowest crew\r\nimaginable. These men were beasts. We tried submissiveness, courtesy,\r\nbut to no avail. When they saw the comfort we derived from our daily\r\nservices they took away our Bible. But they could not take away our\r\nfaith. Mother said, “This is another test. Is there not enough of\r\nChrist in us to do without the Bible?” But Mother was more shaken than\r\nI had ever seen her as she said this. Father looked at the guards and\r\naccepted the humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe men were so unshakeable and cruel. Now we no longer saw or heard\r\nthem. Their inhuman treatment had built a wall around us, a wall of\r\nfear, hard and dark on the outside, soft and mystical inside. We\r\nbecame a world apart, detached from mundane things. Our bodies touched\r\nthe ground, but our souls were far above in God’s world. Each day of\r\npersecution lifted us higher. We were helping Christ to carry His\r\nburden. We were marked to suffer, for Russia.\r\n\r\nIn our last days our privacy was so uncertain we never wholly\r\nundressed. The men were there with a repulsive curiosity. Instinctively\r\nwe drew our skirts aside as one draws away from vermin. The new guards\r\nwere not Russian at all. We heard every kind of language: Polish,\r\nLatvian, Hungarian, German and Yiddish. In the dining room, carelessly\r\nthrown on the table, we saw German newspapers which we did not touch.\r\nThe guards were ready for any trouble, their expressions were filled\r\nwith accusations.\r\n\r\nYurovsky took a fiendish delight in drawing the family into\r\nconversation. The evil in his soul came through, to scar his face. We\r\nwanted to hold ourselves aloof but we did not wish to anger him. His\r\nmouth was always full of saliva and every time he spoke we feared it\r\nwould fly out at us. Yurovsky, Sverdlov, Goloshchekin and Medvediev\r\nwith four Letts and Hungarians searched the entire house. They pulled\r\nout all our suitcases, books and pictures and examined every nook and\r\ncorner, and by the time they were through searching, the house was in\r\ncomplete disorder.\r\n\r\nFather read a great deal in order to get his mind off the humiliating\r\nsurroundings. He wondered if we could memorize such and such a passage,\r\nhoping thereby to relieve our nervous tension. He still believed that\r\nthe fate of our family and Russia was in God’s hands. His belief was a\r\ngreat comfort to us, and helped to carry us through the dark nights. At\r\nlength our Bible was returned to us.\r\n\r\nYurovsky came into our quarters one day with a cigarette in his mouth.\r\nAs he stood in front of us, he pulled out a match from his pocket,\r\nstruck it on the sole of his shoe and lighted the cigarette. It was\r\nnot hard to recognize it as one of Father’s gold-tipped, Russian\r\ndouble-eagle cigarettes. These cigarettes were made especially for\r\nFather by Benson and Hedges with his name on them, but Father had not\r\nused many of these during the war. Yurovsky wanted Father to see him\r\nsmoke this long, slender aristocrat of cigarettes, hoping to hurt\r\nhis feelings. When he finished smoking he left the gold-tipped butt\r\non the ashtray for us to see. We girls also noticed he wore some of\r\nFather’s clothes, probably taken from the trunks in the attic. His\r\nappearance was always untidy, no matter what he wore, and his shirt was\r\nalways open at the neck. From his bushy, black eyebrows he looked out\r\nsideways, never straight into one’s eyes.\r\n\r\nTo our horror we were not allowed to lock our bathroom door, so we went\r\nin pairs to wash, one of us always stood near the door for fear that\r\nsomeone might walk in. Near the bathroom there was a stairway leading\r\ndownstairs, at the head of which there stood a guard, all eyes. One day\r\nwhile Marie and I were crossing the hall, I noticed something shining\r\non the floor and picked it up. It was a key with the inscription, “Made\r\nin U.S.A.” We wondered if there were an American in the house, perhaps\r\nfor the purpose of saving us. Mother thought she had heard some one\r\ntalking in English, but she was not sure.\r\n\r\nYurovsky was an assumed name. He and many others had changed their\r\nnames so as to attribute their crimes to the Russian people. There\r\nis no doubt that many Russians were involved in crime but when the\r\ncharacter of the revolution was revealed and much Russian blood\r\nhad been spilled, then it was too late for those who supported the\r\nrevolutionists to repent. The revolution was a foreign importation of\r\nLenin and Trotsky--it destroyed the soul of Russia. They attacked the\r\nchurches and smeared the altars with human blood, those altars that\r\nhad stood there since Byzantine times. This beautiful religion, “The\r\nEastern Church”, our forefathers had adopted while persecution of the\r\nChristians was still practiced.\r\n\r\nMany of those of varying backgrounds who took a leading part in the\r\nrevolutionary movement in Russia were poisoned by German propaganda.\r\nGermany, I have heard, spent many tens of millions of dollars of\r\nRussian money to promote the Revolution; this money was made available\r\nto them for the care of the Russian prisoners of war. Instead they\r\nused the money to overthrow Imperial Russia, while our warriors were\r\nstarving in dirty barracks.\r\n\r\nFather was accused of being instrumental in the Jewish pogrom in\r\nthe Ukraine. The fact is Father did not know about it at all until\r\none of the Grand Dukes, while on his way to the Crimea, heard of it\r\nand telephoned Father. Immediately the Preobrazhensky regiment was\r\ndispatched by special train, and other military forces and police\r\nwere sent from Bendery to quell these riots. Jews were not the\r\nonly casualties of these disturbances. Other nationalities such as\r\nBulgarians were taken for Jews, and some were killed. The pogrom\r\nwas touched off by the following incident. A small boy was seized\r\nallegedly by Jews. A Jewish sect at that time, in its ritual, believed\r\nin sacrificing a Christian and taking his blood. For this purpose they\r\ntook the boy who was without stain. The veins on the boy’s body were\r\ncut in many places from which blood was taken. From this torture he\r\ndied. When the boy was not found someone reported hearing a scream. A\r\nstorekeeper placed the boy into a nail barrel and carted it away to a\r\nfield. There he was found dead with bloody nails imbedded in his body.\r\nThe barrel was traced to the storekeeper. The discovery of the crime\r\nmarked the start of the pogrom. This incident was told to us children\r\nby our friend Dr. Vatrik, the famous surgeon who came occasionally to\r\nthe palace to care for Alexei during his illness. According to another\r\naccount the boy was not seized by Jews, but by one of his relatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1911]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1906]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1916]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1960]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1963]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1938]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1944]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1909]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1913]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1913]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1963]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1940]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1943]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1913]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1913-14]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1922]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1960]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1928]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1929]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1963]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1917]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1936]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1915]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1938]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1938]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1913]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1914]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1912]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1934]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1934-35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _ca._ 1913]\r\n\r\nThe Imperial family never hated the Jews. Jews were received in all\r\nmilitary hospitals with the same care as any other men during the war.\r\nMany Jews fought heroically for Russia and died on the battlefield. But\r\nmany did everything possible to escape being taken into the army, by\r\ncrossing the border to the Austrian and German side, where they were\r\nplaced over Russian prisoners of war and caused them untold suffering.\r\nFather did more for the Jews than any Emperor before him. My parents\r\nalways advocated the principle of freedom of religion.\r\n\r\nCount Benckendorff and several others connected closely with my family\r\nfrom the time of Grandfather’s reign were Roman Catholics.\r\n\r\nA new commissar arrived from Moscow, and Father was questioned several\r\ntimes in the next few days. The Commissar hinted at the possibility of\r\nfreedom to leave the country, if Father would consider signing certain\r\ndocuments. Father vehemently rejected having anything to do with\r\nMoscow. He made it clear that he had nothing more to say.\r\n\r\nFather once asked us, after he returned from one of these talks, if\r\nwe children would accept freedom in Germany or stay and suffer. We\r\nall agreed to stay in our country. He seemed pleased at this mutual\r\nfeeling. Soon afterwards new guards arrived and our situation became\r\nworse, almost unbearable. These heartless men made us understand that\r\ntheir duty was to cause us every kind of humiliation and deprivation.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Voykov came and demanded to see our jewels. They searched\r\nthe house many times. Finally he picked Mother’s engagement ring--a\r\nlarge ruby of a beautiful color, actually a red diamond, probably the\r\nonly one of its kind in the world. When Father was about eighteen\r\nyears old, various jewelers in St. Petersburg began to search for rare\r\nstones. Bolin, the well-known jeweler, found this diamond and Father\r\npurchased it from him to be made into an engagement ring for his future\r\nbride. Voykov took this ring as a souvenir, he said, and wore it on\r\nhis little finger. Father could do nothing but forget the loss. Voykov\r\nwas still wearing the ring when we saw him again a few days before the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nOn another day, this man again came into our living room without\r\nwarning and began a long discourse about Ulianov (Lenin) and Pilsudski.\r\nHe claimed that these two would soon be regarded as the world’s\r\ngreatest men. Father made no reply but picked up a book and began to\r\nread. When Voykov continued his assertions, Father agreed with him\r\nsaying that no doubt what he said was true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII OUR FINAL DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, July 13th, 1918 (new style), we made our final decision,\r\nafter Father was questioned for the last time. Now Yurovsky and Voykov\r\npretended to have a special interest in Alexei. We feared they might\r\ntake him to Moscow, so that Father would be forced to yield to their\r\ndemands. Father said they would have to kill him first before they\r\ncould touch any of his children. They knew that Father meant every\r\nword of it. Those heartless men got into Alexei’s room, sat on his\r\nbed and watched him cut out his soldiers. They kept up a rapid-fire\r\nconversation, even though Alexei was annoyed. We wondered if they were\r\ntrying to gain my brother’s confidence in order to poison him. So we\r\nwarned Alexei not to eat anything they might give him.\r\n\r\nYurovsky, unlike other Commissars, constantly followed us. We were\r\nconscious of his presence and could not ignore him. He was surrounded\r\nwith guards mostly of foreign origin whose breath reeked with alcohol,\r\nthough he himself did not appear to take any. He told Dr. Botkin he had\r\nhad pneumonia a year before and since then his doctor forbade the use\r\nof alcohol. We felt that the new guards were dangerous men.\r\n\r\nOne of them, a German or Austrian, whose name was Mebus or Nebus, said\r\nhe was sent by Trotsky to search the house. He must see everything of\r\nvalue. He rifled through every drawer, suitcase, bed and mattress and\r\ncushion. Among the medicine bottles they found one bottle with Persian\r\ngrey powder. They took the bottle, saying that it was dynamite. Dr.\r\nBotkin was present when they sent this dangerous explosive to be\r\nanalyzed outside, in spite of his explanation that it was a powder\r\nprescribed for Mother to be used in a vaporizer for her sinus trouble.\r\nShortly thereafter it was returned, having been found by the chemists\r\nto be a harmless powder.\r\n\r\nAfter his initial haul, Mebus returned, saying he had been searching\r\nin the bathroom, and announced that he had found some bullets wrapped\r\nin a woman’s garment, also some guns hidden under something, God knows\r\nwhere. We saw that the garment in question was a blouse belonging to\r\none of us sisters, probably taken from the trunks in the attic, but\r\nwe had not seen these trunks nor the garment since we left Tobolsk.\r\nThe keys of these trunks and our money had been entrusted to General\r\nTatishchev, but upon our arrival in Ekaterinburg we were separated from\r\nhim. The Commissars probably confiscated the General’s belongings and\r\nthus found the keys, which they must have recognized as ours by special\r\nmarkings upon them.\r\n\r\nWe did not know where the entrance to this attic was. As to the blouse,\r\nit was originally sent to us in Tobolsk by Anna Vyrubova. Nebus or\r\nMebus came in with the blouse, accompanied by a Commissar named\r\nHorwath, a Hungarian, and by four or five others who spoke German. When\r\nwe heard them saying “Kishason” (lady), we knew they were Hungarians.\r\nOne of these men wore an open shirt, and from his neck hung a black\r\ncord, a cross and a small square bag of soiled white cloth with\r\nsomething in it.\r\n\r\nThousands of these prisoners of war had willingly joined the Cheka,\r\nsome for political reasons, others for religious reasons--or lack of\r\nthem--and still others for loot. Horwath’s companions also included two\r\nJews named Beloborodov and Goloshchekin (they had adopted these names).\r\nThey fixed their eyes on our icons with a remark to which we did not\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon Yurovsky, Beloborodov, Goloshchekin and Horwath\r\nwalked through our rooms, demanding that we place all our jewels on\r\nthe table. At this time we wore only our gold baptismal crosses\r\nand silver rings with an inscription “Save and Protect us”. We were\r\nafraid not to expose everything, especially with eyes fastened on us\r\ngirls so suspiciously. They made no effort to examine our travelling\r\nclothes and for that we were thankful. They took everything they saw.\r\nYurovsky with the help of others made a list of every item, then gave\r\nFather a copy--a scrap of paper--as a receipt, signed by all four\r\nthieves. He asked Father to value each item. Father said, “They have\r\ngreat sentimental value to us, since many of them are gifts from my\r\nwife’s family and her grandmother--Queen Victoria--and from myself.”\r\nYurovsky asked: “But how much would such a piece cost if purchased\r\ntoday?” Father answered, “I am not a jeweler by trade, I cannot put\r\na value on them.” Their grasping hands trembled when they took our\r\ntreasures and placed them between layers in a cushioned bag. Later by\r\nsearching the dining room and among the household things they found\r\nsome gold-coated candles. They became suspicious and melted some but,\r\nto their disappointment, found nothing in them. The clinking of glasses\r\nin the office that evening kept us awake until long past midnight. No\r\ndoubt the jewels were disposed of before our eyes were closed. These\r\nstolen and now blood-stained treasures were sold in foreign lands and\r\nare no doubt now adorning various ladies in many countries.\r\n\r\nEarly in the evening of this Saturday, Yurovsky stood excitedly at the\r\ndoor of our parents’ bedroom and said, “Nicholai Alexandrovich, your\r\nrequest is granted. The priest will be here tomorrow to conduct Sunday\r\nservices.” The same evening we gathered some icons and, with the help\r\nof Father’s valet, a table was prepared in the middle of the rear wall\r\nand covered with a long white towel. We got everything ready for the\r\nnext morning and prayed that there would be no unpleasantness between\r\nthese godless men and the priest.\r\n\r\nSunday morning, July 14th, arrived and as we assembled in our room,\r\nYurovsky came in and asked if we were ready. “Right, we are,” said\r\nFather. One of us sisters wheeled Alexei’s chair into the room. He\r\ngazed happily around with a greeting to the little group of a few\r\nfriends who waited for us to enter the big room. However, a mistake\r\nhad been made in this service. In his note to Yurovsky, Father\r\nhad requested a service called “Obiednya” at which Communion is\r\nadministered. We were all surprised to find that “Obiednitsa” was being\r\nconducted at which no Communion is administered. It is a service that\r\nis held for the dead.\r\n\r\nFather asked Dr. Botkin to check with Yurovsky, because he had\r\nrequested a Communion. Yurovsky motioned to the priest, saying, “A\r\nCommunion is requested.” Evidently Yurovsky knew that the service\r\nfor the dead was meant for our own funeral service. No doubt Father\r\nmust have known that the tragedy was near because he requested the\r\nCommunion. While the priest made his preparations and covered the wine\r\nchalice with a fine embroidered cloth, Yurovsky made an attempt to take\r\nthe chalice from him to see what was in it. Father Storozhev jerked\r\nthe chalice away and in a trembling voice shouted, “I will not let\r\nyou touch this Holy Sacrament with your hands.” The priest stood some\r\ndistance from us, since we were not permitted to have confession in the\r\nusual way. He raised the cross and said, “God shall forgive your sins.”\r\nWe went to our knees in tears as Yurovsky stood aside watching us. We\r\nsisters were weeping throughout the entire service, and, as our hearts\r\nwere only human, we could not chant during this service. We arose;\r\nthe priest held the cloth over the chalice and administered the Holy\r\nCommunion to us, while the deacon sang the creed.\r\n\r\nFather Storozhev had brought the usual _prosphora_--the small biscuit\r\nwhich is given to each communicant--but Yurovsky insisted on breaking\r\neach of these into pieces to make sure there was nothing hidden\r\nin them. Dr. Botkin and others who until now had maintained their\r\ncomposure broke down. A napkin was brought and the _prosphora_ was\r\nbroken into pieces by the priest, and the service was concluded. In\r\nthis dimly-lighted room a rite so divine and profound in our moment of\r\nsolitude gave us a secret hope in our hearts. After the service Father\r\nkissed on both cheeks, according to Russian custom, the few remaining\r\nfriends--Dr. Botkin, Trup, Kharitonov and the little Leonid. Mother and\r\nwe sisters kissed Anna Demidova, our faithful maid.\r\n\r\nMother gave her hand to Dr. Botkin; he bowed and kissed her fingertips.\r\nAll noticed that on his face was a strange expression. He was nervous\r\nafter hearing the prophetic words being sung “Peace to the Soul.” He\r\nkissed us children on both cheeks, while tears fell from his eyes and\r\nremained between his glasses and the bags beneath his eyes.\r\n\r\nDear Papula, how he suffered beyond measure for his loyalty to us. His\r\nface always brightened whenever he saw me. I always engaged him in a\r\nconversation. Somehow he felt closer to Alexei and to me than to our\r\nsisters. At the end this good man became bold, in spite of his frailty.\r\nHe was somewhat older than my Father. At that time Father was fifty\r\nyears old and Mother forty-six. There was a unity and peace among us.\r\nFather said, without bitterness, “A great crime is being committed,\r\nbut I feel we have been true to ourselves and to Russia. The Russian\r\npeople have been betrayed.” Olga, who could say things so beautifully,\r\nadded from her tender heart, “The Russian people have been hypnotized\r\nand one must not judge them by the present. They are good people.”\r\nDr. Botkin added, “Be true, do not fear, in a minute all will pass.”\r\nWe were startled at his words, and we wondered afterwards whether he\r\nrealized the full meaning of what he was saying. He must have known of\r\nour destiny.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the hostile actions of Yurovsky and his accomplices\r\nthroughout Father Storozhev’s service, we felt we had been enfolded by\r\nGod and filled with power to ignore the brutality of the guards. When\r\nthey came into the sitting room while Father was reading aloud, one of\r\nus stood up, so that they might see as little as possible.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, July 15th two maids came to clean the rooms as usual.\r\nObviously they were frightened and seemed anxious to deliver some\r\nmessage to us, but the guards’ presence everywhere prevented any\r\ncommunication. On the same day, Yurovsky brought his associates to the\r\nhouse. These included Voykov, Goloshchekin and Jacob Sverdlov who were\r\ncomrades of Lenin, Trotsky, and other international conspirators. We\r\nsaw these four and others in the house all day long; they followed us\r\neven into the garden, when we went out for a fifteen minute walk in the\r\nafternoon. Once Sverdlov said to Father that when the festivities of\r\nthe Three Hundred Year rule of the Romanov Dynasty were celebrated in\r\n1913, he was ready to blow up the whole Imperial family with a bomb.\r\nFather replied, “What kept you from doing it? I probably would not be\r\nhere today nor would my family be.”\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday July the 16th, the young kitchen boy, Leonid, who used to\r\ncome to play with Alexei for an hour every day, had no sooner arrived\r\nthan a guard announced that Leonid’s uncle, Ivan Sidniev (our former\r\nfootman) had come to see the boy. The little fellow jumped to his feet\r\nand happily said, “Oh, please forgive me, I shall be back.” We knew\r\nright then, it was some sort of trick. When he did not return and\r\nFather inquired why, he was told, “Tomorrow he will come.”\r\n\r\nOn the 16th also, Alexei got up, though his cold was worse, due to the\r\nhot water treatments for his swollen hands and feet which were still\r\npartially paralyzed. In the afternoon, we took him into the small\r\ngarden where he was able to walk a little, but had to be carried down\r\nthe steps. We all went out except Marie, who remained with Mother who\r\nhad not been out for several days.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the garden a pigeon flew toward the porch, frantically\r\nflapping its wings. Then it flew to the other side of the house, where\r\nwe were not allowed to walk. Upon our return Mother to our surprise\r\ntold us that a bird flapped its wings on her bedroom window and she\r\ncould see only a fluttering shadow of a bird’s wings in the window\r\nglass which was painted white. Then she said, “At the coronation we\r\nwere presented with two birds; and, as you remember, during the Three\r\nHundredth Anniversary a pigeon flew inside the Cathedral when the\r\nservice was held; and today a bird came into the picture again.”\r\n\r\nSome time before the tragedy Dr. Botkin was sent by Yurovsky to ask\r\nMother if she wished her sister Ella to come to see her and that, if\r\nso, Yurovsky would arrange her transportation. Mother at once wrote to\r\nher sister to say that we were looking forward to her arrival.\r\n\r\nVery late that afternoon, Father and the rest of us were asked by\r\n_Goloshchekin and Yurovsky to write letters to our friends and\r\nrelatives here and abroad to the effect that we were in the far North,\r\nin Sweden, and that we were quite happy in our new surroundings_. Olga\r\nangrily replied, “If we get there, we will write to our friends from\r\nthere and not from here.” Dr. Botkin had written such a letter or\r\nletters under pressure since he feared for the lives of his children.\r\nHe said he had written one to Madame Elizabeth Narishkina and one or\r\nmore to his children hoping they were still in Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nEvidently those men wanted the world to believe that we escaped at\r\nnight and were hiding somewhere in the wilderness and that our friends\r\nafter receiving such letters would be satisfied that we were safe.\r\nIn this way they wanted to hide their crime from the people. While\r\nFather was reading, suddenly he turned to us and said, “It is exactly\r\ntwenty-seven years this month (July 1918) since I returned from Japan\r\nand that is the icon which was presented to me in the Government of Ufa\r\nupon my arrival there.” It was from the Government of Ufa that Father’s\r\ntrain was returned a few weeks earlier to Ekaterinburg. Someone\r\ncommented that it seemed weird that Father suddenly at this time should\r\nremember that unpleasant event which took place in Japan, where he\r\nalmost lost his life.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Yurovsky walked into our sitting room startling us.\r\nJemmy, my little dog, charged at him, snarling. She had never acted\r\nlike that before. I called her back, but it was too late. Yurovsky\r\ngrabbed her by the neck and carried her away, saying, “Who brought this\r\ndog up here?”\r\n\r\nYurovsky reappeared as if nothing had happened and began talking,\r\nthough no one heard what he said. Our only thought was, “What became of\r\nJemmy?” No apologetic attitude crept into his affability. He continued\r\nto talk and to toy with my frightened stupefaction. Then he walked to\r\nAlexei and sat on his bed as if they were on the most intimate terms.\r\nHe pulled out a revolver and handed it to brother saying, “Do you want\r\nto see an American automatic?” “No,” replied Alexei. No doubt all the\r\nwarning given against the man leaped into the boy’s mind. He did not\r\nwant to take it but Yurovsky thrust the weapon into his hand. “Is\r\nit loaded?” asked Alexei. Father stood up next to Alexei and said,\r\n“Please leave my son alone, he is not well.” Ignoring Father’s request\r\nYurovsky answered, “It is not loaded now, but it will be.” Alexei\r\nbecame frightened as he held the pistol and Yurovsky regarded him with\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nAt last Yurovsky went out. Mother with trembling hands picked up a book\r\nas we gathered around while Father read aloud. He let the book open\r\nitself and read: “Let us take courage and be strong, look straight with\r\nour spiritual eyes up to Christ.” Then again he read: “Do not fear\r\nthose who kill the body, but those who wish to kill the soul.” It may\r\nnot be exact but as I remember it went like that. His voice was hardly\r\nstronger than a whisper. We could hardly hear him over the drunken\r\nshouts that shrieked through the house from the guards’ quarters.\r\nMother bent her head close to the window and listened in bewildered\r\nabsorption. Her cheeks turned somewhat red, she looked around and\r\nsmiled. Finally she said, “I hear the beautiful _Ave Maria_ so clearly,\r\njust as if it were being played in this very room.” We strained our\r\nears again but could not hear what Mother claimed she was hearing.\r\n\r\nI tried desperately to lose myself in the quotation which Father had\r\njust read, but Jemmy kept coming to my mind. I was afraid they had\r\nkilled her. Father said, “Most of the Russian people usually are kind\r\nto animals.” Those were comforting words, but was Yurovsky a Russian?\r\nI was depressed with the thoughts about Jemmy, added to the off-key\r\nsinging of the guards downstairs. Mother also noticed that they seemed\r\nunusually noisy this night, and they were drinking entirely too much.\r\nFather laid the book down and said: “The best thing we can do is to go\r\nto bed and forget about it.”\r\n\r\nThat evening as Father crossed the hall he saw several extra guards\r\nexamining some rifles in the middle of the hall near the doors between\r\nthe office and the stairway. When they saw Father, they lowered the\r\nbutts of their rifles to the floor. Father knew every make of gun. He\r\nsaid, “These are the high-powered, German army rifles holding usually\r\nfive cartridges; they can be fired singly or in rapid succession.”\r\nOlga replied, “I remember at the hospital, soldiers used to come with\r\ntheir bones shattered and their flesh mutilated. We always knew the\r\ntype of gun which inflicted such wounds. Russian guns caused clean\r\nwounds.” Then Father added, “If Wilhelm had enough poison, he would\r\nhave poisoned all the bullets.” This was the last time he mentioned the\r\nKaiser’s name. It was four or five hours before the tragedy.\r\n\r\nFather knew the Kaiser was obsessed with the thought of victory at\r\nany cost, victory even if it meant the sacrifice of the Kaiser’s own\r\ngodson, my brother, whom he had vowed to protect according to our\r\nreligion; also the sacrifice of his own cousins, my parents, and their\r\ndaughters, too, for whom on his last visit in 1912 he had professed so\r\nmuch love. All this must have been on his conscience. Yet Holland gave\r\nrefuge to this man who enslaved Russia and his own country as well.\r\n\r\nThese German guns which Father saw were frightening but we could not\r\nbelieve and it did not even come to our minds that Wilhelm, bad as he\r\nwas, would permit the assassination of our family. We knew that Germany\r\nhad demanded that our family should be delivered to Moscow unharmed;\r\napparently the German High Command had learned of the character of our\r\njailers.\r\n\r\nLater I heard that the assassination was not known to Wilhelm until\r\nafterwards and that the German High Command was responsible, as well\r\nas some of our Allies, for all the catastrophe in my land. They had\r\nsent, or permitted, these men to come to Russia in order to bring about\r\na revolution. They knew that if the old government should recover\r\npower it would not be pleasant for those responsible for the terrible\r\nkillings and robberies they had caused in my country.\r\n\r\nAfter my escape I was told that, when the Kaiser heard of the killing\r\nof our family and of the Grand Duchess Elizabeth and some of the other\r\nRomanovs, the Kaiser was beyond himself. He cried bitterly for hours,\r\nsaying: “I have lost my best friend. Nicky was my best friend. I loved\r\nthem all. My hands are clean. Why have the other cousins permitted such\r\ncrimes to take place? My conscience is clean. I did not know what they\r\nwere doing. I had nothing to do with it. It was Mirbach and Ludendorff,\r\nsupported by those Nicky believed were his friends.”\r\n\r\nIn the last hours at Ekaterinburg Father spoke and his words are still\r\nfresh in my mind. He said: “It is the end of Russia, but of the Allies,\r\ntoo. They have dug their own graves and soon they too will lie in them,\r\nand Germany will pay retribution for her deeds of treachery. No one can\r\nescape consequences, no matter what they do to avoid them; sooner or\r\nlater they will have to pay. The taste of blood is an epidemic and it\r\nwill soon flow all over the world.”\r\n\r\nWilhelm could not bring disgrace on Father before the people of Russia,\r\nbut he did bring disgrace on himself before the world.\r\n\r\nThe orders to kill the entire Romanov family came direct to Voykov,\r\nBeloborodov, Goloshchekin from the top Bolshevik leaders: Trotsky,\r\nLenin, Sverdlov, Apfelbaum and the other men I have mentioned\r\npreviously. They exchanged telegrams daily. On the 16th of July\r\nYurovsky had a long talk with the men in Moscow. In the afternoon when\r\nYurovsky came into our sitting room, Mother got up and went into her\r\nbedroom. He boasted that he, Sverdlov, Beloborodov and other comrades\r\nin Ekaterinburg were connected by telephone the entire morning talking\r\nwith the comrades in Moscow. Dr. Botkin told us later that Yurovsky\r\nhad talked with Trotsky, Lenin and others and that Goloshchekin or\r\nSverdlov, or both, had just returned from Moscow, and that there had\r\nbeen a great deal of activity and excitement at the office.\r\n\r\nIn fact the Kremlin leaders were responsible for sending the\r\nAustro-Hungarians and Letts to guard the house inside for the last two\r\nweeks. Father remarked, “They use the same tactics as the Chinese did\r\nin the Boxer rebellion. But the danger here has come to the native\r\npeople in their own land but not to foreigners.”\r\n\r\nThese two weeks our lives had hung by a thread and on the 16th of July\r\nbetween 9:00 A.M. and 12:30 P.M. our destiny was sealed.\r\n\r\nDuring my escape my rescuer told me that all the guards outside the\r\nhouse--they were Russians--were given vodka to drink--as much as\r\nthey could consume. None of them knew what was to take place inside\r\nthat night. He also told me that one of his friends was told by one\r\nof the outside guards that the crime never would have taken place if\r\nthe guards inside had been Russians and if the guards outside had not\r\nall been given free drinks late that evening. These outside guards,\r\nRussians, would have turned their guns on the foreigners because their\r\nhumiliation was at its summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII DAWN TURNS TO DUSK\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 16th, in the early evening, we heard directly below\r\nour rooms what we thought was the moving of large and heavy objects.\r\nThe noise disturbed the whole household. We went to bed at 10:30 but\r\ncould not sleep. Drunken voices from outside penetrated into all our\r\nrooms. Yurovsky’s room was on our floor somewhat removed from our\r\nquarters. From his room came the sounds of lewd talking. Soon we heard\r\nheavy footsteps approaching in our direction. The light went on and\r\nthen a _deep_ voice was heard. It was Yurovsky’s.\r\n\r\nHe entered the room and then went on into Father’s room. Soon Father\r\nappeared in the doorway and in a faltering voice told us to hurry and\r\nget ready as we had to leave within the next forty minutes. While we\r\nwere washing and dressing, we prayed and quietly cried. We were almost\r\nready when another guard came in, telling us not to pack any of our\r\nbelongings as there was no time. We took only a few essential things.\r\nTatiana ran into our parents’ bedroom and helped Alexei to put on his\r\nbraces over his limbs while Olga packed Alexei’s medicine. He was still\r\nill and quite helpless and began to weep as did we sisters.\r\n\r\nWe girls dressed in white blouses and lightweight gray skirts and\r\njackets and carried top coats, which bore some of our treasures sewn\r\ninside. Father and Alexei were dressed in military coats; Mother in a\r\nblack suit. When we were ready, Dr. Botkin came in with a small bag and\r\na coat on his arm.\r\n\r\nThe last few minutes before we left, we went to our knees and\r\nfervently prayed before an ancient icon of Christ and shared the holy\r\n_prosphora_ given us by the priest on the previous Sunday. This icon\r\nfor centuries had been handed down from one Russian sovereign’s family\r\nto another. All our treasures had been catalogued for many years; there\r\nwas a description of each piece with its origin and history. We carried\r\nthis icon to Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg. We knew that it was the oldest\r\nand the most venerated of all the icons and more valuable than those\r\nthat were embellished with gold and silver and studded with precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThis framed cloth icon was said to have been made from the towel that\r\nwas used by Jesus to wipe the perspiration and blood from His face\r\nbefore His crucifixion and it pictured clearly, though faintly, the\r\nimprint of His face. Subsequent tests disclosed that the cloth of the\r\nicon was made of the same material that was used in Jerusalem at the\r\ntime of Christ, and that the spots and outline of the face were of\r\nhuman blood and perspiration. It was further shown that no human hand\r\ncould have made this icon and for that reason it was called in Russian\r\n“Nerukotvorenny Spas” which means: No-hand-created Saviour. We left our\r\nrooms with a prayer on our lips.\r\n\r\nMy heart was pounding and a cold chill ran over my body as I was again\r\nstruck with the violent force of the premonition which had haunted\r\nme all day long, ever since I awoke with a horrible dream early that\r\nmorning. I had dreamed that I stood in the doorway of a very small\r\nwooden house somewhat like a fishing shack. It stood on a wooden\r\nplatform. Presently I sensed that the little shack was floating on\r\nwaters which were gradually rising from below the surface. As I looked\r\nthrough the mist I could see nothing around but water: no forest or\r\nmountain which could produce any safety. Not a murmur or a sound or a\r\nripple could be heard. The depressing, lonely quietness engulfed me. I\r\nknew I was sinking slowly.\r\n\r\nI was haunted by this nightmare when a man came into the dining\r\nroom where the family had assembled, together with Dr. Botkin, Ivan\r\nKharitonov and Anna Demidova. The man asked, “Are you ready?” Father\r\nanswered, “Right, we are.” “Follow me, please,” the man said. Before\r\nwe left the dining room Anna, who had with her two pillows, a blanket\r\nand a tiny bag, handed one of the pillows to Tatiana. Concealed in the\r\npillows were some of our jewels.\r\n\r\nWith his lantern shedding a feeble light the man now led us along the\r\nhall and down the stairway into the courtyard. Father’s strong and\r\nprotective arms were carrying Alexei who was crying from fear.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I remembered our dogs. “Jemmy,” I said tearfully. “My dog,\r\nplease let me have her.”\r\n\r\n“You will get your dogs downstairs,” shouted one of the men.\r\n\r\nWith our help, Mother followed behind Father. The man moved his lantern\r\nfrom side to side to give a better light to the stairway. Mother almost\r\nfell as we reached the ground floor and passed into the yard. We saw\r\nshadows moving around in the court. The air was cool and the night was\r\nbright.\r\n\r\nWe re-entered the same building, passed through a hallway, and entered\r\nthe second room on the right. It was approximately the same arrangement\r\nas upstairs. This was probably where we had heard the noises earlier\r\nin the evening from my sisters’ and my room. It had sounded as if\r\nfurniture and other heavy objects were being moved. This room was about\r\nthe size of our sleeping room and had not one single piece of furniture\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nDr. Botkin and Anna were told to put their small bags on the far side\r\nof the room, and we, too, had to put our jackets and top coats in the\r\nsame place. The house was on an elevation so that these rooms were\r\nactually on the ground floor, I think one step up or down. Yurovsky\r\nwent ahead of Father. In the hall he said something to Father, pointing\r\nto the first door we had just passed. Father held Alexei until three\r\nchairs were brought. Then he placed Alexei on one of the chairs and\r\nleft the room. Mother sat on the left side of Alexei. About eight men\r\nwere there when we came in. Probably some who followed us had been the\r\nshadows in the courtyard. They were dressed partly in civilian and\r\npartly in foreign military uniforms. All had revolvers stuck in their\r\nholsters and hand grenades attached to their belts.\r\n\r\nTrup had been compelled to follow us. He had been ill for some days and\r\nhad not been on hand to care for Father’s personal things. The guards\r\nhad either failed to arouse him earlier or his fate had been decided\r\nat the last minute, for he appeared in his night garment and carried\r\nhis clothes on his arm. We had not been allowed to see him frequently\r\nduring his illness. He was not more than thirty-four or thirty-five. He\r\nlooked much thinner and was almost blue in the face.\r\n\r\nTatiana rearranged the pillow which she had taken from Anna to make\r\nAlexei more comfortable, while we waited for Father to come back. In\r\nfour or five minutes the group of men separated into two groups. Father\r\nwalked between them. His face was ashen and the “Otsu mark” on his\r\nforehead was red like fire. His left shoulder and the left side of his\r\nface just below his eye were twitching. He pulled a handkerchief from\r\nhis pocket, wiped his face and took the chair next to Alexei on the\r\nlatter’s right side. What this man Yurovsky had said to Father in that\r\nroom no one will ever know. Father preceded Yurovsky who was followed\r\nby others and who remained standing in the middle of the group.\r\n\r\nI was on my Mother’s left side and Dr. Botkin was behind her on her\r\nright. My sisters were a few steps behind us. The men stood about eight\r\nfeet away facing us. I am sure the others thought as I did that we were\r\ntrapped, and there was nothing to do or say.\r\n\r\nWhen Father entered the room, Mother started to raise herself. Suddenly\r\nshe trembled and fell back into the chair as her head slumped to her\r\nright shoulder toward Alexei. Then I screamed and grabbed Dr. Botkin’s\r\narm. While I was screaming, Yurovsky said something, exactly what, I\r\ndid not hear. Simultaneously, I heard screams....\r\n\r\nAfter this I was somewhat conscious. Still I felt no pain and did not\r\nsee anyone fall but my lips were frozen cold and I felt very clammy\r\nand there was a violent ringing in my ears. I wanted to get up but I\r\nfelt as if I were paralyzed, and lost consciousness entirely.\r\n\r\nHow long I lay in blackness, which held me floating between life and\r\ndeath, I cannot tell. Was it hours or days? I do not know. All too soon\r\nI awoke from oblivion to realization and horror. I had no sensation of\r\ncoming back to life. All at once I knew I was alive and in pain. My\r\nmind was clear, I was cold and conscious of some terrible catastrophe.\r\nAt first I shrieked frightfully; then I was afraid to breathe and to\r\nopen my eyes. I knew I had just come to from unconsciousness. I began\r\nto feel the increasing pain and shiver from the wet cold, and became\r\nconvinced that I was not dreaming. But a fear came over me. First I\r\nthought that I fell on the floor and got hurt, and that they, thinking\r\nI was dead, had buried me alive without a coffin, and that my grave was\r\nnot yet sealed. I tried to control my shrieks realizing too well what\r\nhad happened, though all was perfectly quiet now. Still I did not wish\r\nto open my eyes for fear of what I would see. I was cold and in great\r\npain. My neck seemed swollen. I felt a tightness around my nose and\r\nswelling below my left eye.\r\n\r\nThe others: Were they beside me? Were they alive but afraid to move? I\r\nbegan to wonder. In the darkness I could feel no body warmth; I could\r\nhear no sound of breathing. Suddenly, it came to me. I remembered the\r\nanguished screams. I lay in a hush, a silence that was all the more\r\npronounced by contrast with the noise and frantic screams before. It\r\nwas the silence of death and the tomb. I opened my right eye, just\r\na little. Quickly I closed it. My left eye was so swollen, it could\r\nnot open. The air was heavy and there was a smell of damp earth. I\r\nlistened. Surely someone must be near me. I moved my hands cautiously.\r\nI could feel on my right a crumbly earthen wall. Was I in a tomb?\r\nBuried alive? My eye flew open. I could see a tiny opening a little\r\ndistance above.\r\n\r\nI made a move, only to feel excruciating pain. I felt nauseated.\r\nMy head pounded with pain. When the convulsion passed away, I lay\r\nexhausted, wet, clammy, awaiting the death I could not escape. Now I\r\ndid not want to escape. I wanted to die. How long could I last in this\r\ntomb? Dear God, let it be quick! Why did they not bury us together?\r\nWe always wanted to be together, in life and in death. My convulsive\r\nnoises had brought nothing but silence. I was frightened and so ill.\r\nI began to weep chokingly. My cries resounded through the hollowness,\r\nincreasing my feeling of loneliness. If only someone would hear and\r\nend my agony. My ears rang, my head reeled with dizziness. My nausea\r\nreturned. Once more I was in the grip of a convulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI After The Tragedy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX DUGOUT\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly I felt a hand on my forehead. I stiffened with terror, unable\r\nto cry or even feel nausea. Was it the hand of death? Now I was cold\r\nall over, except my head--the hand warmed my forehead. The hand lifted.\r\nI waited for the weapon to plunge. I could not look. I kept my eye\r\nclosed. I waited. The suspense would hold no longer.\r\n\r\nI opened my eye a little. I could see a candle light. My eye opened\r\nwider. I saw a woman coming toward me. I screamed and shut my eye.\r\nAgain I felt the warm hand on my forehead. I was hardly breathing. I\r\nwaited another eternity. The hand went away. As I lay there in fear, I\r\nwondered if it was a real woman or a vision. She was no one I had seen\r\nbefore. She came closer again and lifted a container of water to my\r\nlips, but I could not lift my head to drink it.\r\n\r\n“Where does it hurt you?” she said in Russian, but with a foreign\r\naccent. I wanted to answer, but no words came. I pointed to my stomach\r\nand gagged a little. It was too much effort. I began to feel ill,\r\nwrithing in nausea. I felt a thin slice of preserved lemon thrust\r\nthrough my lips. My lips smarted. I clutched them with my hand. There\r\nwas something wrong with my lips, my left arm, my head, my ankle and\r\nnose. She had bandaged my abdomen. I was too miserable to care. The\r\nlemon preserve soothed the nausea. I sucked it eagerly but hardly\r\ntasted it, it was so washed with tears. I lay there stupefied as my eye\r\nfastened on the lighted candle. It was so frightening, so bewildering:\r\nthe tomb, the candle, the woman. The flame flickered and almost went\r\nout as she moved.\r\n\r\nAgain startled, my eye moved around to find that once more the woman\r\nwas creeping down the wall; a few steps and she was at my side. She\r\nlifted the candle nearer, placed it on the little table beside my bed,\r\nset down a basin of water, threw back my covers, and began to undo the\r\nbandage about my stomach. Without a glance at my face she washed my\r\nwound and deftly rebandaged it. Still without looking at my face, she\r\nunbandaged my leg, bathed and bandaged it again. She dressed my head\r\nwounds, washed my face and hands, picked up her basin and disappeared\r\nup the wall and through the ceiling.\r\n\r\nFascinated and yet horrified, I stared at the spot where she\r\ndisappeared. Suddenly two feet appeared again, a skirt, a woman coming\r\ndown. She was at my side and placed another thin slice of this rare\r\nlemon preserve to my lips. She looked at me for a minute. Then she\r\nclimbed up the wall and was gone.\r\n\r\nI did not know where I was, but now I could see a trap door and a\r\nladder of not too many rungs leading up to it. I have a clear picture\r\nof the woman’s face as she nursed me. She had nice features, black\r\neyes; the hair, perhaps dark brown once was now partly gray and pulled\r\nback tight into a knot at the back of her head. She seemed no older\r\nthan my Mother. Her hands were long and slender; she was tall and thin.\r\nShe did not look like a peasant, but her general appearance told me she\r\nwas no stranger to hardship. She was confident and efficient but did\r\nnot seem to be a professional nurse.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I forgot my aches and pains. I wanted to know who this\r\nperson was. How did an utter stranger happen to be with me? How did\r\nI get here? How long ago had things happened? Perhaps several days,\r\nsince I felt crusted dry blood on the left side of my eyebrow, nose\r\nand cheek. My hair was matted and stiff with blood, crumbs of dried\r\nblood covered my pillow. My left leg was so sore I could hardly move\r\nit. My finger nails were packed with stained matter. But where was my\r\nfamily? I was afraid to think. My head hammered, my jaws ached, my ears\r\nrang. Every little emotion--every motion--was an agonizing experience.\r\nI must have cried myself to sleep, for I awoke sobbing. Perhaps it was\r\na nightmare. It could not be that I, the little one, always protected\r\nand spared could be alone. Now the woman was moving about near me.\r\nWere _they_, too, being cared for by strangers? I sobbed until sleep\r\novertook me. There was no way of measuring time. I wept until I slept\r\nto wake up sobbing until I wept myself to sleep again.\r\n\r\nAfter the sobbing a violent nausea seized me and the woman rushed up\r\nthe ladder to bring me a drink of water. She sponged my lips and fed\r\nme with a spoon. All too soon I discovered why my lip was sore. My two\r\nupper front teeth were broken and driven almost through the upper lip.\r\nOne of these front teeth had been filled in Tobolsk by Dr. Kostritsky\r\nwho took care of Mother’s false tooth and Father’s teeth. Several of\r\nmy teeth, in the lower left jaw, were also loose; they merely were in\r\nplace. There was a small hole in my right cheek and a piece of flesh\r\nwas missing.\r\n\r\nSleep was the only respite. Wakefulness brought nothing but horror and\r\nhaunting thoughts. I welcomed sharp pain as it distracted my thinking.\r\nHow long this orgy of weeping and sleeping kept up I have no idea.\r\nOccasional moments of composure wedged themselves in as I realized I\r\nfelt better. Immediately desperation drove me into fresh weeping. I\r\nwanted to die. I was afraid to think.\r\n\r\nAll the time the woman worked tirelessly to make me comfortable. I\r\ncould not help but feel sorry to see her climb up and down the ladder\r\nto bring me something when her efforts seemed to do me so little good.\r\nShe was thorough but gentle. She changed my dressings often. While\r\nshe busied herself with me, I kept my eyes closed--the sight of her\r\naccentuated my loneliness. She seemed cruelly impersonal as she worked\r\nover me. She wanted to do a good and thorough job. If she would only\r\nspeak to me, give me some sign of sympathy, that I might know she felt\r\nfriendly! She always avoided meeting my eyes, eyes that now squinted\r\nthrough smarting slits, so sore were they from constant crying.\r\n\r\nHer care was faithful but she seemed oblivious to the hungry soul\r\ninside me. She washed my scalp wound but made no attempt to comb my\r\nmatted hair. Each passing day there were fewer and fewer bits of dried\r\nblood on the pillow. Finally she cut my hair on the two spots of my\r\nscalp in order to keep the wound clean. The deep round hole in front of\r\nmy ankle and the wounds in my back were still painful.\r\n\r\nThe torments of my mind partially overcome, I wanted to ask questions,\r\nyet I did not. As long as I did not know definitely, I could hope. At\r\nsuch moments I was almost glad of the woman’s lack of sympathy. Her\r\nmost expressive kindness was when she placed her hand on my head when\r\nI felt nauseated, but that hand was too much of a reality and always\r\na fresh spur to loneliness. The nausea attacks became routine under\r\nthe incessant crying. The woman did everything in her power to relieve\r\nthem, everything except to extend a sympathetic word.\r\n\r\nUncertainty was tearing my heart. One minute I longed desperately for\r\nthe woman to talk. The next minute I watched her with horror for fear\r\nshe would. Perhaps she was waiting for me to grow strong enough to\r\nhear the truth--the last thing I wanted to hear. If I could only be\r\ntold that the others were being cared for, I would not murmur at this\r\ntemporary separation, and the pain would not be so great.\r\n\r\nThe moment came when my torture boiled to the surface. The woman\r\nwas dressing my wounds when the desire to know the answers became\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?” I whispered.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, then in a low voice I could hardly catch, she said, “In\r\na little room underneath a house.” Then she added, after a pause, “It\r\nis very dangerous; never talk aloud lest someone might hear.”\r\n\r\n“The others?” I gasped. It was out--the question. If I could only\r\nretrieve it. Suspense. I thought she never would answer. She turned her\r\nface away and said, “All gone. Please ask me no more, that is all I\r\nknow.” She rushed to the ladder and went away.\r\n\r\nAll gone. I had known it all the time but would not admit it.\r\nYet everything had happened so quickly, I could not be sure. The\r\nexcitement, the running up and down the stairs, the confusion, the room\r\nfilled with rough-looking men. The woman with dishevelled hair; who was\r\nshe? Was all this a vision or a reality? To this day I’ll never know.\r\nYurovsky, the most vicious man in the world swaggered after Father,\r\nwhispering things I could not hear. Father’s shocked face, Mother’s\r\ntrembling, her slumping back in her chair: all this horror together\r\nkept reappearing in my consciousness. The words, “All gone,” whirled\r\naround my head flying out at me from all directions at once. Those soft\r\nblue clouds which I imagined carried them rapidly through the clear\r\nskies. I still could not believe it. Perhaps only Father and Mother are\r\ngone, and brother and sisters are somewhere in a prison.\r\n\r\nAnother period of oblivion ended. Consciousness returned to find the\r\nwoman bending over me. The sight of her brought back a realization of\r\nthe horrible truth; the family was no more, only I was left. No, it\r\ncould not be. Now I wanted her to tell me more, but she shook her head.\r\nI understood.\r\n\r\nFrantic with the hopelessness of it all, I shivered down into my\r\ncovers. My foot struck something solid but warm. It was a bed warmer, a\r\nhot stone wrapped in a cloth. Using my uninjured foot I manoeuvred it\r\nso that I got my hands on it. To me it was more than stone, more than\r\nwarmth. I now felt the woman was sympathetic and underneath her still\r\nexterior I discovered a new companionship.\r\n\r\nIn spite of longing to die, I awoke from each sleep more alive. Each\r\nawakening brought a little less suffering and pain. I could now turn\r\nmy head with less pain and without dizziness. The nausea attacks were\r\nalmost gone--I was getting better. Sleep was the great healer: the\r\nvitality of youth swayed the balance.\r\n\r\nWith real resentment I allowed the woman to tend to my wounds. Since\r\nthey were not serious enough to let me die, I had no desire to examine\r\nthem to ascertain their nature. So far I had received very little\r\nnourishment from taking food, partly because I was afraid the nausea\r\nmight return.\r\n\r\nShe brought me some delicious soup with a strong flavor and containing\r\nsome barley. It was nourishing; I could almost feel an increased\r\nstrength as I took it. Yet I did not want to get well. The woman gave\r\nme good care, but it seemed to be mistaken kindness. Now that I knew\r\nthe worst, she seemed more distant than ever. It was as if she feared\r\nfor her own life. She did what was necessary and departed quickly. But\r\nwhy was she nursing me? I could not understand it. I only knew I was\r\nalone and could not die. Hauntingly the prayer we sisters had written\r\ntogether kept coming to my mind. I tried to say it but the words had\r\nlost their meaning.\r\n\r\nOver and over haunting thoughts catapulted into my mind. How did I\r\nescape the death intended for the whole family? Why did they want to do\r\naway with us? We could have gone abroad, never to return, if we could\r\nonly have kept together. I remembered Mother’s frequent words, that the\r\nthrone had brought nothing but unhappiness to our family. We all loved\r\nour Motherland and would have been content to live as ordinary citizens\r\nin some obscure part of it.\r\n\r\nHad Father suspected this ending? When he carried his head erect, was\r\nhe looking forward with hope or was he facing death squarely to show\r\nhow bravely a Tsar could die? At the price of disloyalty to Russia,\r\nhe could have saved his life. Not he, not Mother, nor any of us could\r\nbe tempted to save ourselves at Russia’s expense. Except when his\r\nepaulettes were removed, I had never seen Father bitter, but only\r\ninfinitely sad that he could not spare his people the tragedy of a\r\nrevolution. The ruthless propaganda would not let the nation know him\r\nfor what he was--one who wanted to do right and do it well. Father was\r\nthe victim of the Kaiser’s intrigue. Mother was misunderstood. She had\r\ndone only what she thought was best for Russia. Now I could see it all.\r\nFrom the very first, there had been no chance....\r\n\r\nWe had been moved to Tobolsk, further inland, making our escape less\r\npossible. Siberia was far from Finland, the mecca of fugitives.\r\nFather had believed Kerensky who assured him we would be safer in the\r\nhinterland--far safer as targets!\r\n\r\nI hoped and prayed that Mother’s heart had failed her before the\r\nassassins’ bullets reached her. I hoped that she had cheated Yurovsky\r\nand his fellow-murderers. This would have given me great satisfaction.\r\nHe at no time fooled Mother. She knew, suspected, and understood it\r\nall. She and Olga had uncanny discernment.\r\n\r\nWe believed God would always take care of us. The little intuitive\r\nprayers that arose within us, when suddenly confronted with a fresh\r\npersecution; the strength that we received in adjusting ourselves to\r\nnew humiliating requirements; the exaltation we felt in the sense of\r\nGod’s guidance. All these underlined the idea, “Though I walk through\r\nthe valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art\r\nwith me.” Perhaps if we had not trusted so exaltingly, we might have\r\ndone more to help ourselves.\r\n\r\nThese were my thoughts of despair when suddenly I heard voices in my\r\ncell, faint voices, but I could understand this much: the man said,\r\n“Organized parties are searching everywhere, in the woods, in the\r\nhouses. They have found nothing. No one suspects us, but you can see we\r\nare in danger.” He said much more than that, but this is all I could\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n“Which one of your sisters was very tall?” the woman asked.\r\n\r\n“Tatiana,” I replied excitedly.\r\n\r\nTurning to the man she said, “It is too bad. Just think, she too, could\r\nbe alive if ...”, her voice faded away, as if she was trying to keep me\r\nfrom hearing.\r\n\r\n“If what?” I burst out with a cry and tried to get out of bed only to\r\nfall back in pain. When I gained my composure, I looked for the man,\r\nbut he was gone. The woman was still there.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, ‘if what?’” I pleaded, as I stretched out my hand to her.\r\n\r\n“Please do not ask any questions. I cannot answer,” she said, as she\r\nrushed to climb the ladder.\r\n\r\nWas there no end to my tortures? I was so near to a little truth, then\r\nto lose it forever. Tatiana. What could have happened that she did not\r\ncome through ... as I had. Together we might have found something to\r\nlive for. That man ... who could he be? He had the same kind of accent\r\nas the woman. From what I had heard him say, it did not seem as if\r\nhe had been one of the actual rescuers. He spoke as if he had heard\r\nthrough someone else; as if he were connected with the rescuers in some\r\nmanner. He, too, was frightened, all because of me. Had they saved me\r\nfor a humane reason or had they stolen my body to rob it and finding me\r\nalive thought it safer to nurse me back to health than to dispose of me?\r\n\r\nFor the first time I began to observe my surroundings. The place was\r\ntiny with a ceiling so low a good-sized person standing could easily\r\ntouch the ceiling with his head. The width and length seemed about nine\r\nby ten feet. All four walls were of dirt with little roots protruding.\r\nThe floor was also plain earth, covered by a braided oval straw mat\r\nextending from my bed almost to the ladder. Now I could see plainly\r\nabout what I had first taken to be my unsealed grave. Close to the\r\nceiling was a small window, a dirt-stained pane of glass about five by\r\neight inches which let almost no light through. I was lying on an army\r\ncot. On the opposite wall was a wooden ladder leading to the trap door.\r\nTo the right of the ladder was a wooden bench covered with blankets,\r\nwhich looked as if it had been used as a bed. Beside me was a small\r\nmarble-topped table with a drawer. A small candle on the table lighted\r\nthe room. A chair was the only other object in my dugout.\r\n\r\nThe question came to my mind, what had become of my clothes--my white\r\nblouse, gray plaid skirt? Now I was clad in a white cotton nightdress,\r\nmuch too large for my frail body. It probably belonged to this woman.\r\nAnd where were my shoes? Had the man discovered the precious stones\r\nin the heels? Had they found the other stones which were sewn in my\r\nclothes, especially inside the buttons? We sisters had some money in\r\nthe belts of our skirts. What had become of all that?\r\n\r\nThey could have everything if only they would tell me about Tatiana.\r\nThe man knew why she had not come through, and so did the woman, yet\r\nthey would not talk to me. The man thought I could be moved, but he\r\nsoon discovered I could not stand on my feet. The woman’s hand was on\r\nmy covers; then I felt sudden warmth in my shivering body. The stone\r\nwas back, good and hot, nicely wrapped. I curled around it.\r\n\r\nGradually my body marched on toward recovery; my head had ceased to\r\nthrob. I could turn it easily. Immediately the woman sensed this\r\nprogress and removed the bandages. My wounds were less painful. Again\r\nwith her uncanny insight into my condition, she placed the pillow\r\nbehind me and sat me up in bed.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was sitting up in bed, I noticed on the table next to\r\nme a brown lump. It looked like a section of a dried apple. I picked\r\nit up; it gave me a feeling of horror, and I quickly dropped it on\r\nthe army blanket covering my bed. As I looked at it closely, I saw\r\na familiar design. I unfolded a small portion of it, and recognized\r\nthe edge as the handkerchief that was given me by Grandmother, who\r\nalso gave one to each of my sisters. I could not imagine where this\r\nhandkerchief had come from. I remembered that when our rooms had last\r\nbeen searched, I had picked it up from the floor and had placed it on\r\na small table in Mother’s room. I do not remember taking it when we\r\nrushed to get dressed that final night, nor did I intend to use this\r\nfine lace handmade keepsake. I must have picked it up absent-mindedly.\r\nAccording to the woman, when I was brought into the dugout that\r\nfateful morning, the handkerchief was clutched tightly in my hand.\r\nI had brought it with me when we left Tsarskoe Selo to Tobolsk and\r\nthen to Ekaterinburg. I intend to place it in the museum which I plan\r\nto establish. Mother had beautiful laces and had brought a few small\r\npieces with her to Tobolsk. Fearing they might be mishandled, these\r\nvaluable laces were to be divided among us children.\r\n\r\nThe woman cared for me quite frequently, although I had no clock\r\nto mark the passing hours, nor was there any sunshine by which to\r\nconjecture the time of day. During my convalescence she let me wear a\r\nwhite cotton jacket which had starched pleating around the neck and\r\ndown the front. This bed jacket was far too large for me, but it was\r\nher best. The sheets on my bed were of a coarse cotton; so was the\r\npillow case. The latter was edged with a peasant lace and was buttoned\r\ntogether. Over the sheet, she had placed a warm army blanket.\r\n\r\nThe room was dark, day hardly distinguishable from night. The little\r\nwindow high up near the ceiling was covered on the outside with hay, as\r\nI later discovered. A little light did penetrate into this dugout, but\r\nat night she hung a dark cloth over this pane. My eyes were sore from\r\nthe lighted candle and I put it out except when she cared for me. I had\r\nno book or magazine or newspaper. No calendar to mark the time of year\r\nor the day of the month. I had no idea whether it was summer or fall.\r\nMy room was always cool and damp and the days long.\r\n\r\nAs I lay in this dark mustiness, I had time to think about everything\r\nthat took place during my seventeen years with my dear family. There\r\nwere so many sudden changes in the political hysteria, that I wondered\r\nif in my thoughts I was confused! It was unbelievable that actually\r\nsuch developments really had taken place. One day I asked the woman,\r\nwhether all the turmoil was a reality or just a nightmare!\r\n\r\n“No!” she replied, “it is true.”\r\n\r\nPropped up in bed, from this vantage point, I was able to see and hear\r\nthe man, should he ever come back. I would judge whether he was friend\r\nor foe. Whatever the man might be, I was sure the woman had nothing\r\nto do with my rescue beyond the determination to make me well. But I\r\nremember the words, “You see how careful we must be.” That sounded as\r\nif they were working together. Perhaps others were involved, others\r\nsaved? When the man should come back I was determined to find out all\r\nthe events from him, from my last recollection to the present time. The\r\nquestions they had asked me gave me hope that Tatiana had been saved.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in these thoughts, I was unaware that someone had come down\r\nthe ladder until I suddenly realized the man stood beside me. Behind\r\nhim was the woman holding a lighted candle. Waves of fresh, sweet air\r\nwafted out from his clothes.\r\n\r\n“Good evening,” he said, “it is cool outside.” “How do you feel?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nMy lips said, “Better, thank you,” but all the time I was thinking, he\r\nsounds friendly. I will ask him.\r\n\r\nBefore I could open my mouth to form the words, his manner became\r\nserious, almost severe. “Never speak out loud,” he warned. “Only in a\r\nwhisper. It is very dangerous.”\r\n\r\nHe wheeled around and was gone up the ladder without another word. The\r\nwoman followed.\r\n\r\nI looked hard at that man and felt satisfied he was not one of the\r\nEkaterinburg guards, nor was he anyone I had ever seen before. In his\r\nshabby English clothes I could not be sure what he was. He carried\r\nhimself erect like a soldier, his hair was well-groomed and he had an\r\neasy manner. He looked at me squarely without self-consciousness and\r\ndelivered his orders without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe woman usually carried my food on a rough, wooden tray. Gradually,\r\nshe brought me more solid food. Occasionally I had some potato; fresh\r\nfish was on my regular diet. When eating solid food I had to be very\r\ncareful as I was afraid that I might swallow some of the teeth that\r\nwere broken at the roots.\r\n\r\nI found one disfigurement after another. I could chew only on the\r\nright side of my mouth. Feeling around my head, I realized I was\r\ncovered with welts, one more painful than the other. I also discovered\r\ntwo long grooves, one on the right side of my head, back of the ear,\r\nabout an inch long, which still remained very painful. I wondered if\r\nthis pain was the result of the accident or was inherited from my\r\nMother who had a sensitive spot on her head. Her hairdresser had to be\r\nvery careful when arranging her hair. Mine might have been caused by\r\nthe bullet that had grazed my head. The pain indicated that my nose,\r\ntoo, was broken.\r\n\r\nA deformed, partly toothless girl at seventeen, alone in a world that\r\ndid not care. My only consolation was that in spite of everything the\r\nLord continued to be beside me.\r\n\r\nBeneath the bandage of my stomach, no part was shot away. I could\r\nnot find a bullet hole; instead, my skin was covered with traceries\r\nas though cut by myriads of flying glass. The woman seemed pleased\r\nthat I was well enough to take an interest in my wounds. She actually\r\nvolunteered the information that she had pulled out small pieces of\r\nblue glass from my flesh. She spread honey over my abdomen and finally\r\nthe honey drew the glass slivers out.\r\n\r\nShe asked, “Do you remember carrying any glass container with you?”\r\n\r\nMother often carried a small blue bottle of smelling salts. It was\r\npossible she had this in her hand at the time.\r\n\r\nThe woman showed me the wounds on my left leg, an oval gash, very deep;\r\nand a small one in the back; a round, corresponding hole in the front.\r\nShe said nothing more as though to give no loophole, but worked rapidly\r\nand then hurried up the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe man became a more frequent visitor in my dugout. He was always\r\nfriendly, more so than the woman. He always had something pleasant\r\nto say about the weather, perhaps a cheerful “Good evening.” After a\r\nwhile he brought along another man who seemed to be of an entirely\r\ndifferent type--dressed in peasant clothes, and obviously a peasant.\r\nBoth were impatient for me to get well. They were inquiring about\r\nmy progress, asking the woman how soon I might be up and around.\r\nFrom their nervousness I could see they were in constant terror of\r\ndiscovery. During one of the visits, I saw a newspaper folded in the\r\npocket of the first man. When he turned around I recognized only the\r\nLatin characters. I could not tell what the language was.\r\n\r\nWhenever the men came I was frightened and excited, hoping that one\r\nof them would drop a hint that another member of my family was saved.\r\nIt was hard for me to believe that all were gone. With these thoughts\r\nand uncertainties surrounding me, I was terrified. I knew nothing of\r\nan outside world--my home in Tsarskoe Selo was the only world I knew.\r\nPerhaps all this was a retribution, because I had often envied girls\r\nwho were free to go where they wished. As a young girl I had never\r\ntaken anything seriously. I had always been shielded, often looked on\r\nwith amusement, until the war broke out when suddenly I discovered how\r\nserious life was to be. Now no one was left to stand between me and\r\nreality. These dirt walls were reality. Yet even here someone protected\r\nme. Beyond these walls there seemed to be some sinister power, yet I\r\ncould not comprehend it all. Days and days passed, perhaps weeks and\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nSitting up in bed was a short preliminary, a to-be milestone. Standing\r\non my feet, first touching the ground, I felt the braided straw rug on\r\nthe earthen ground as my head reeled in dizziness. I could not get back\r\nto my bed fast enough. That proved one thing; I was not as well as my\r\nnurse had thought.\r\n\r\nNext morning she put me on my feet once more. My legs were stronger\r\nand there was no return of my dizzy spell. I stood a very short time,\r\nthen thankfully I found myself in bed. This was repeated. I protested\r\nagainst these exercises, because my thoughts and my whole being were\r\ndisturbed by them.\r\n\r\nAll too soon she had me walking the length of the rug several times. I\r\nwept defiantly as she led me along. I staggered frightfully, but in the\r\nend I forced myself to walk as long as I could endure it. Finally I\r\nhad it mastered and the woman was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThen came the time when the woman began to bring things from above.\r\nShe brought clothes to dress me in. First she drew on long, heavy\r\nunderwear. Then she put on me a pair of old black cotton stockings, a\r\nslip, and an old gingham dress, so faded the original blue-gray color\r\nwas almost undiscernible. Finally she fastened on peasant shoes two or\r\nthree sizes too large. My original shoe size was about four-and-a-half\r\nat the time. She stood me up, tied a babushka on my head, threw a coat\r\naround my shoulders and walked me toward the ladder. “We are going\r\nupstairs,” she said. “The outdoors.”\r\n\r\nMy heart started to beat. Perhaps they were going to kill me. The\r\nthought of possible death did not generate fear now.\r\n\r\nIf I were going to my death, my mind was ready, but my body lagged. My\r\nhands held tight to the rung of the ladder when I realized the left\r\nside of my lower back was injured. I could not raise my feet without\r\nhelp. The woman lifted them one at a time--to the first rung, then to\r\nthe second. She unclutched my hands and placed them on the next higher\r\nstep. She swung herself behind me, her hands on the rung beside mine,\r\nher body framed me like a strong armchair. She began to climb, lifting\r\nme ahead of her, up and up, and through the trap door.\r\n\r\nI climbed out on my hands and knees as she instructed me to do. She\r\nguided me along a dark hall about two yards wide through a door to the\r\nopposite side and into a room. Sitting at a table in front of me were\r\nthe two men who had previously visited my dugout. A candle on the table\r\nwas the only light in the room. The windows were tightly covered with\r\nheavy cloth. These things my eyes took in as the woman led me to a\r\nchair facing the men. My mind was calm but my body shook uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nThe man, my first visitor, was the spokesman. “Don’t be afraid,” he\r\nbegan. “You know we are trying to help you.”\r\n\r\nHis voice was reassuring and my body calmed a little.\r\n\r\n“We are in great danger,” he continued. “Spies have been everywhere,\r\nsearching for missing bodies. If anyone comes near you, and tries to\r\nspeak to you, pretend to be deaf and dumb. Make signs with your hands\r\nbut never speak to anyone, not even to us, unless we first speak to\r\nyou. We cannot be careful enough.” In a softer tone he added, “I grieve\r\nto inform you--the others are no more. I can tell you nothing more.”\r\n\r\nHe paused deferentially. I understood. That subject was closed between\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he went on, “It is becoming too dangerous to remain\r\nhere. We must go away, but first you must accustom yourself to the\r\noutdoors. Ahead of us is a long, strenuous journey. We dare not risk\r\nthe daylight, so the trip must be made after dark. Tonight will be a\r\nstarter. Tomorrow we will see you again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX RECOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nI was dismissed. It was over. I was not to be killed. My body throbbed\r\nwith gladness.\r\n\r\nThe woman was standing beside me. She led me to the door and out into\r\nthe open night. The air was sweet and fresh, so noticeable after being\r\naccustomed for so long to musty air. I breathed deeply to refresh my\r\nwhole being. It was so long since the last time I had seen the night\r\nall lighted up with golden stars so near and yet so far. This was the\r\nmost beautiful night and the saddest one I could remember. The horizon\r\nseemed to be far away, sad and quiet as if the world were in a deep\r\nslumber. But probably this very minute some one was facing a death\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nA heavy stone lay on my soul. I could find no consolation. Never will\r\nI see them again. My sisters fresh as rosebuds, in the very morning of\r\ntheir lives, and now withered away before they even blossomed, their\r\nyouthful faces now covered with the cold earth, vanished completely and\r\nforever before my very eyes. My heart was aflame with a grief that was\r\ntearing my soul.\r\n\r\nWere these the same stars which looked down on us at Tsarskoe Selo? At\r\nLivadia? The same as on our cruises, when Father’s stories about the\r\nheavens seemed so real? Father could see them no more; nor Mother, nor\r\nsisters, nor my brother Alexei. Knowing that their eyes were closed\r\nforever, filled me with a loneliness I could not bear.\r\n\r\nHow could the stars go on shining as if nothing had happened? How could\r\nthe air be so sweet and fresh when such foulness had taken place? If\r\nmy family could not breathe this fresh air, how could I? And how could\r\nI gaze on this heavenly grandeur?\r\n\r\nAll about me reminded me of my family. I had no more tears but I cried\r\ninwardly. I lost my balance. I collapsed on the ground. The man and the\r\nwoman were watching me. They rushed to help me to my feet, and back\r\ninto the house and down the ladder.\r\n\r\nAgain I sank into the damp earthiness of my tiny room, thankful for\r\nits darkness. Here I felt closer to my family. Outside the stars could\r\nsparkle, the air could be fresh, but inside the contrast could not\r\nflaunt itself before me. I need not look at a world untouched by our\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night I awoke to find myself walking about my\r\ndugout. I was completely confused, with no idea of where I was. My bare\r\nfeet sank into the soft dirt. At last my foot touched the straw rug\r\nwhich led me to my bed, and in bed was still the welcoming warmth of\r\nthe stone wrapped in a cloth.\r\n\r\nWalking around with bare feet had given me a slight cold. The woman was\r\nupset; she attributed the setback to the night air, to my first trip\r\noutdoors. The men called early in the morning. They were annoyed that I\r\nhad a cold but agreed with the woman it was best to defer another trip\r\nupstairs until I felt better. I heard them say, “Speed up her recovery.”\r\n\r\nI lay still another night wrapped in my thoughts. Though the men had\r\nsaid that my family was no more, still I would not believe it How could\r\nthey be so sure? I would never cease to hope, since I had learned how\r\ndifficult it was to die. To me their nobility, their trust in God,\r\ntheir character were more impressive than the grandeur of the night.\r\nGod would not fail them.\r\n\r\nBut we were separated. That was certainty. Somewhere I would be\r\ndeposited to face an indifferent world, a world that would not bend its\r\nknee to me. I must suppress my identity and make a new life, all alone.\r\nGod knows how I missed them all. I lay there, one minute hoping, then\r\ndespairing. I felt close to them in a world which was not theirs nor\r\nmine. The woman continued her care of me; I was suspended between two\r\nworlds belonging neither to this one nor the one to come. The idea\r\ncrossed my mind several times that suicide was an easy escape from my\r\nmisery, but my strong faith based on years of prayer would not permit\r\nthis lack of will power.\r\n\r\nSoon my cold faded away and once more the woman had me climbing the\r\nladder. This time she stood on a chair, put both hands under my arms\r\nand lifted me up the few rungs through the trap door. In a few moments\r\nI was again in the presence of the same two men.\r\n\r\nAs before, the only light came from the candle on the table. The\r\nwindows had the same heavy coverings. I almost said, “Good evening,”\r\nbut remembered not to, just in time. With no preliminaries the\r\nspokesman started immediately.\r\n\r\n“We are very much interested in straightening out a few things,” he\r\nsaid. “We want to ask you some questions.”\r\n\r\nI was all fear. At Tobolsk, at Ekaterinburg, questions meant traps.\r\nSurging through me, I remembered my Mother’s advice: “Answer\r\ncourteously but give no information.”\r\n\r\n“Were they unkind to you in Tobolsk?”\r\n\r\nI wanted to tell the truth. In spite of my impaired speech, they wanted\r\nme to answer their questions.\r\n\r\n“Very unkind, the last days,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“What sort of things did they do to you?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated. There had been so much torture and suffering, it was\r\ndifficult to begin with any specific detail. In contrast to the final\r\noutcome, the treatment we endured at Tobolsk suddenly seemed trivial. I\r\ncould not mention anything specific, not yet. The tragedy towered over\r\nall events, making all others seem unimportant.\r\n\r\n“Everything to contribute to our unhappiness and humiliation,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Who were with you in Tobolsk?” he began.\r\n\r\nSomething I could answer easily. I told him, “Our friends, and\r\nhousehold help.” Their faithfulness excited my memories.\r\n\r\n“Did they all go with you to Ekaterinburg?”\r\n\r\nWhile in thought, I raised my eyes and saw a door on my right side\r\nwhich apparently led into another room. Through a crack I saw a bright\r\nlight and a shadow flitting across the crack in a sort of rhythmical\r\nmotion, as if someone were swinging back and forth. My thoughts were\r\ndistracted for a moment. My training came to my aid. I could see\r\nwithout betraying what I saw. I hid my surprise at discovering that\r\nthere were other people in the house besides the two men and the woman.\r\nI dismissed my curiosity since I was beginning to have confidence in\r\nthese men. Their questions must be answered.\r\n\r\nI began, “Some went first with Father, Mother, and Marie, Dr. Botkin,\r\nPrince Dolgorukov, a maid and Father’s valet. When our parents left\r\nTobolsk the others stayed to take care of us children who were left\r\nbehind to go later when Alexei should be better.”\r\n\r\nWhat kind of quarters did we have in Ekaterinburg? Did we have enough\r\nto eat? Did we ever go outdoors? Did we see our friends? How did we\r\npass the time? These questions were meant to pave the way for more\r\nquestions that were to come later and to encourage me to answer them.\r\nIn a way I was glad to confide my sorrow.\r\n\r\nWhen they were through, one of the men signalled the woman, who led me\r\noutdoors. My second walk in the air. I had decided to take the outing\r\nwithout once lifting my eyes to the sky. I took short breaths and\r\nleaned heavily on the woman’s arm. We walked around the house. Guarding\r\nus, I sensed rather than saw, was one of the two men, walking a few\r\nfeet behind us. At last we were back at the entrance. The house was\r\ndark as we entered the first room and passed through the open trap door\r\nand down the ladder. The trap door was lowered and I noticed a cloth\r\nwas nailed on the inside. No sounds must penetrate through that floor.\r\nThe exertion and gratification at my own courage put me into a sound\r\nsleep that night.\r\n\r\nI awoke stronger and aware of a new milestone in my march to recovery.\r\nEach day the terrifying world I knew nothing of drew closer. I\r\nhad almost ceased to struggle to keep from entering this world of\r\nreality. I was being carried like a leaf floating on the surface of a\r\nfast-flowing stream. I could not stop or sink. The prospect of living\r\nmy life in good health would have been frightening enough, but now I\r\nmust face ill health and loneliness as well. If only crying could oust\r\nthese seething tortures.\r\n\r\nThe woman was busy folding a blanket. When she finished she piled it\r\non her arm, tossed the pillow on top and lowered her chin on it for a\r\nfirm grip on her burden. Now she was climbing the ladder, load and all.\r\nThere was something final in the way she climbed. It suddenly dawned on\r\nme that she had spent the many nights close by my side. Satisfied that\r\nI was out of danger, she was henceforth going to sleep upstairs. I had\r\nnot been conscious of her presence; misery had made me deaf and blind.\r\nNow that her watchful custody was removed, I became frightened and\r\nlonged for the nearness I had not been aware of.\r\n\r\nWithout a clock, I had no idea at what time our day started. When the\r\nwoman appeared, it was morning. The smoky window became a panel of gray\r\nafter she removed its covering. I always listened for a “Good morning.”\r\nBut that was all. She never did tell me what I should call her. If\r\nI needed her attention, I whispered, “Lady, please.” I did overhear\r\nthe man call her Iliana or Irina. When she combed my hair, she did it\r\ngently. All her services were performed tenderly. I thought I detected\r\na resemblance between her and the man who was the first spokesman. I\r\nwished I knew something about these men and the woman.\r\n\r\nAfter an early supper she helped me to get dressed again in the same\r\ngrotesque clothes and took me to the room above. The same men awaited\r\nme; the same rhythmical shadow flitted through the crack. Previously\r\nthe questions had been of a general nature. Now they began to ask me\r\nmore personal ones. They asked about Madame Vyrubova. Did she influence\r\nthe Tsarina? Was she intimate with Rasputin? Did she live in the\r\npalace? I did not want to answer any of these questions, yet I did not\r\ndare to refuse.\r\n\r\nAll the time the shadow continued to pass over the lighted crack of\r\nthe door. Who could it be? Was there someone writing down my answers?\r\nI was terrified. Suddenly I became so exhausted that I thought I would\r\nfall from the chair. My interrogator saw the situation and excused\r\nme. The woman accompanied me outdoors, and we walked around the house\r\nseveral times. Then I returned to my little hole. Once more I sank into\r\nmy congenial darkness. The woman climbed the ladder, her touch was as\r\nsoft as a feather. The trap door opened, then lowered back into place,\r\nquietly but firmly.\r\n\r\nOne day she brought me a piece of meat and vegetables. I refused to eat\r\nmeat. The woman had no longer to bandage my wounds; they had healed\r\nsufficiently. Now I felt an itching sensation on my head and the woman\r\nwas pleased with my progress. “Your hair will cover it nicely,” she\r\nsaid. There in the darkness my hair was growing fast. I was able to\r\nbraid it.\r\n\r\nAhead of me lay the nightly inquisition. Yet each trip into the\r\noutdoors made me more independent physically. Once more and many times\r\nlater I sat in the question room trying to control myself in the face\r\nof the curiosity of these two men and the woman. Now my Mother was the\r\nsubject of their questioning.\r\n\r\n“Did your uncle come from Germany to see the Tsarina?” The shadow in\r\nthe next room seemed poised for my answer. Suddenly I was glad of\r\nthe recording. Here was the opportunity to show Mother as the eager\r\nhelpmate that she really was, trying to report to Father the facts\r\nas she saw them in his absence. “Did the Tsarina listen to Rasputin,\r\nbecause she believed in his honesty, foreseeing, and experience?”\r\n\r\nI answered, “Whatever Mother did, she did it only for the good of\r\nRussia. When Father did not agree with Mother, she accepted his\r\ndecision as final, knowing she could have no further influence.” I\r\nexpressed these thoughts as carefully as I could, hoping whoever it was\r\nwould take them down accurately.\r\n\r\nEvery evening for some two weeks I was questioned. Each period of\r\nquestioning lasted about an hour. When each bout was ended I was\r\nburning as with a fever. The questions were personal and plentiful. The\r\nsubjects were continually changed, covering the entire Imperial family\r\nand the palace staff, as well as the household employees. Many of these\r\nquestions seemed so impertinent to me that one night I burst out, “Why\r\nare you asking me all this?” They replied, “We only want to know.”\r\n\r\nGradually I began to take in my outdoor surroundings. Not far away I\r\nsaw a haystack. Beyond it, a dark vastness, perhaps a forest or low\r\nhills. During my walks around the house, I noticed that it was square\r\nand squat like most peasant houses. I gathered it was made of wood.\r\nThe roof was shingled. I tried to find my tiny window and finally\r\nlocated it behind the camouflage of hay. I could hardly see it. Now I\r\nunderstood why my room was so dark.\r\n\r\nThe house stood some distance from the road and a long dirt driveway\r\nextended from the road to the rear of the house. To one side was a\r\nlarge shed, perhaps a barn, which apparently did not house any animals\r\nsince I heard no sounds from it Occasionally I did hear lowing herds\r\nin the distance. Perhaps one of these cows was responsible for the\r\nmilk I received each day. There were no signs of horses or chickens.\r\nBut several times I heard a faint train-whistle in the distance. I\r\nnever saw any arrivals or departures. Did these men come from the\r\nneighboring houses and walk across the fields? What went on in this\r\nhouse was a complete mystery to me. Did these two men and the woman\r\nlive in this house? There was another young woman. Was she behind the\r\nill-fitting door? I had only seen the hall and the question room, but\r\nI felt sure there was another room in the house. The furnishings I saw\r\nwere meagre. Perhaps this was an abandoned farmhouse or discarded\r\nservants’ quarters attached to someone’s estate. The outside, too, had\r\na deserted appearance. I noticed some hay scattered near the house. My\r\nobservations were all based on what little I could see in the darkness.\r\nI felt sure these people were in someone’s service, or they were using\r\nthe place as a temporary hideout.\r\n\r\nThe men became quite friendly. The woman continued her silent care\r\nof me. The men talked freely, even joked about my recovery. Without\r\nwarning, the question I had always suppressed, suddenly broke out. “Why\r\ndid you rescue me?” I inquired.\r\n\r\nThe faces of both men turned red. The man I first met was shocked. The\r\nsecond man’s eyes blazed with fury. “What is it that you want to know?”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nMy feelings were deeply hurt at this coarse reply. My fears returned in\r\nfull force. The worst must lie ahead.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that I must soon go away, otherwise these people would\r\npay the penalty. Now I wanted to stay in my dugout forever. It was\r\nmine and I was part of it. I would inscribe my name here, but where\r\nexactly? I had nothing with which to write, no crayon, pen or pencil.\r\nThere was a hairpin on the table. Quickly I was out of bed and standing\r\non the rug. I pulled out the small drawer and set it upside down on my\r\nbed and began scratching my name with the hairpin. I bore down with\r\nall my strength on the bottom of the drawer and formed the letters and\r\nnumbers: “A.N.R. 1918.” It could not have been a legible signature but,\r\nsuch as it was, there it would stay, a witness to my habitation, these\r\nhairpin hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nA few days after this incident the woman seemed to take unusual pains\r\nwith my grooming. She braided my hair smoothly. She gave me a fresh\r\npillow which had a lace edging, sat me up and dressed me in one of her\r\njackets. She arranged my covers neatly. By the time she had finished\r\nthe men were already descending the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe first man took a small kodak from his pocket and after lighting\r\nseveral candles snapped my picture. A few days later they returned\r\nwith several prints. I had one of these until it disappeared with my\r\nmanuscript. The clearest object in the picture was the lace on the\r\npillow case. How different I looked! My nose was still swollen, my jaw\r\ncaved in, my eyes had many light dots.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it a splendid likeness?” the spokesman was saying.\r\n\r\nAs they turned to climb the ladder, they reminded me of the danger of\r\ntheir position. “Things are terrible,” they said in unison. “People are\r\nlined up and shot at the slightest excuse.”\r\n\r\nI gathered that they were more and more frightened at having me around.\r\nThe questioning continued, followed by a walk each time. How could they\r\nthink of so many things to ask?\r\n\r\nMy family would have been surprised at my diplomatic skill. The mystery\r\ncontinued. I learned no more about the house. After each outing I\r\nwas returned to my dugout. Then I began to feel an undercurrent of\r\nexcitement which told me that the time of my departure was near.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was again in the question room, one of the men said,\r\n“We can not stay here any longer. We are taking you to another little\r\nplace. It is very risky. Never forget to be deaf and dumb. Speak only\r\nwith your hands. We start early in the morning. You will take a short\r\nwalk now, then sleep until we awaken you.”\r\n\r\nOur outing was brief. Once more I was hustled down the ladder. The\r\nwoman helped me into bed and went away. Some time after midnight, the\r\nwoman returned. This hour reminded me of the night at Ekaterinburg. I\r\nbegan to cry. Her worn, white face told me only too well that she had\r\nworked many hours preparing for our departure. She brought me a cup of\r\nmilk. Her hand was shaking. I felt a warm feeling of appreciation. I\r\ntoo was trembling. I spilled the milk. She dried the splash on my dress\r\nand turned away but our souls were knit together.\r\n\r\nShe rushed me to dress in the same clothes I had worn before, except\r\nthat the old dress now had a wide hem. It almost reached to my ankles.\r\nMy black stockings were well hidden by my high laced shoes and the\r\nlong dress. She tied a babushka around my head.\r\n\r\nSilently she handed me a label which had apparently been removed from\r\nsomeone’s coat or dress. Stamped on brown taffeta in gold were a\r\ndouble-headed eagle and the words, “Mikhailov Moskva.” Mikhailov was\r\nthe name of a well-known Moscow firm. I could not recall having ever\r\nseen such a label and could only guess at her motive in giving it to\r\nme. Possibly she thought I would recognize it and surmise something as\r\nto what had happened to its owner. I still have it.\r\n\r\nI asked once more what had become of my old clothes that I had had\r\non that fatal night. Puzzlingly she replied, “They were so badly\r\nbloodsoaked that I had them burned.” I wished to ask her again what\r\nbecame of the items I had had hidden in my clothes. I was afraid. I was\r\nat their mercy. I had no choice. There were some fifty large diamonds\r\nand pearls and about twenty-five rubies, emeralds and sapphires.\r\n\r\nI took a final glance at the room and thought of the uncertain future\r\nahead. Now that I was leaving this tiny spot, I knew that I owed it a\r\ngreat deal. The only thing I had to give it I had already given--my\r\ninitials.\r\n\r\nIn front of the ladder I knelt down to pray for a moment for my dear\r\nones. I dreaded to leave the dugout for fear that I might never again\r\nvisit this part of the world where the remains of my beloved ones no\r\ndoubt were buried--somewhere nearby.\r\n\r\nMy mind went back to a question I was once asked: Why did I always\r\nstand at some distance from my sisters? I now realized that I must have\r\nunconsciously had the premonition that we would some day be separated.\r\n\r\nI blew out the candle and groped my way through the room to climb the\r\nladder, and out through the trap door. A clam was being tom from its\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nIn the hall I was greeted with a rush of fresh air. Our departure was\r\nto be immediate, with no light of any kind. In a few seconds the woman\r\nled me outdoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI WESTWARD TREK\r\n\r\n\r\nI was conscious of figures mysteriously scurrying back and forth to the\r\nhouse. My eyes began to focus better and I could see standing a man who\r\nled me to the back of a hay wagon, as if to introduce me to the scheme\r\ndevised for my escape. He took my hand that I might feel him unlatch\r\na little door, then he pushed my arm through the opening, indicating\r\nto me the empty space inside. He guided my hand to the bottom, to the\r\nbedding of hay and the blanket, then the arched roof to feel the hoops\r\nlaid closely above. He directed my fingers to the cloth between the\r\nhoops, trying to let me know a covering had been thrown over to keep\r\nthe hay from falling through. He made me touch the sides of the wagon\r\nand the arched top covered with hay. My hiding place was to be this\r\ncoop, camouflaged as a load of hay. The ingenious plan revealed once\r\nmore the risk these people were taking. I stood hesitating between fear\r\nand appreciation, when suddenly I found myself being lifted feet first\r\nthrough the tiny door. He handed me a bottle of water and without a\r\nword hooked the little door. Locked up in my little cage, I listened.\r\nFootsteps. It seemed there were many. I was anxious to catch every\r\nsound. I could hear nothing. The wagon bent forward as under a heavy\r\nweight. A stronger lurch and we were in motion.\r\n\r\nNow I felt like a little calf being taken to the market. Yet I had\r\nreason to trust these people. Their careful preparation, their discreet\r\nsilence could be only for my safety. I could not understand them, but\r\nI could not mistake their kindness. Perhaps someone would meet me at\r\nour destination. The serious, elaborate precautions indicated we were\r\nin great danger. This first part of the journey was no doubt the most\r\ncritical. Through the rear of the wagon I could see a light. It was the\r\nsun coming up.\r\n\r\nI presume we traveled for hours, the horse moving at a steady and brisk\r\npace. I could tell when we were going up or down. The road was rough\r\nand I was badly shaken. These country roads were in poor shape and full\r\nof ruts. The dust sifted through the partitioned door and filled my\r\neyes and nostrils. I felt I was suffocating. I could hardly breathe.\r\nMy dry throat stiffened. I reached for the bottle, found and removed\r\nthe cork, swallowed some water to wash the dust down, and sponged my\r\nface. My cramped coop was long enough to permit me to lie full length,\r\nand high enough so I could easily turn over. I could even draw up my\r\nknees, though I could not sit up. I rolled on my stomach and pressed my\r\nface against the little door to catch any current of air. I hoped they\r\nwould soon stop, but dared not call out for fear that my voice would\r\nbetray us. The driver seemed to know the road well, as the cart did not\r\nhesitate in making any of the turns. It had no springs and it jolted\r\nbrutally and ceaselessly. My head was splitting. Would my wounds break\r\nopen? My face was stiff and plastered with a mixture of dust and sweat.\r\nI was miserable. We travelled for a long time. Then light began to\r\npenetrate through the door and the wagon took a sudden turn. A plunge\r\ndown and up again, then slowly along a level road with many bends. It\r\nstopped. I listened. Had we been halted for searching? Did someone jump\r\ndown from the driver’s seat? Some one was coming around the wagon. It\r\nwas one of the men, pushing the hay from the little door.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door flew open. In came a rush of fresh air. Feeling\r\nunsteady I tottered into the arms of the woman. I was glad she had come\r\nwith us. She smiled, reflecting my pleasure at seeing her. She held me\r\nfor a moment before I could walk around to loosen my tensed body.\r\n\r\nIt was most exciting to find myself free in the woods in the daylight.\r\nI learned there was no trouble here. We had stopped for a rest and to\r\ncare for the horse. My eyes squinted and watered painfully, and I could\r\ndistinguish very little. I bathed my eyes and the woman tied a cloth\r\nover them and left me sitting on a log. I lifted the cloth a tiny bit\r\nto accustom my eyes to the light. First I saw some green, then the\r\nforest, then a winding stream and myriads of bushes screening us from\r\nthe road--a perfectly secluded spot. Later in the evening we resumed\r\nour journey, stopping several times for a rest. At daybreak the light\r\nstarted again to seep into my coop. The way the horse turned indicated\r\nwe were not here by accident, but had actually stopped according to\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning; the dew still on the grass made the air\r\nsuperb. I could see some deep orange-colored flowers and some wild\r\nasters. I plucked some of those dry seeds from the plants and tossed\r\nthem into the air, hoping they would fly through the woods in the\r\ndirection where my family was resting. I knew so little of the cruel\r\nfacts surrounding my dear ones. If I could only kneel beside their\r\ngraves for a silent prayer. But even this was denied me. Water rushed\r\ndown a little stream and humming insects flitted about No prison walls\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nPresently the woman spread the army blanket on the ground, motioning me\r\nto sit on it, and opened a lunch basket. She had some hard boiled eggs,\r\none for each of us, fried fish, bread. It was a sumptuous feast, and a\r\nglorious feeling there under the shaggy trees, the profusion of pines\r\nand birches, under the deep blue sky--a typical Siberian scene. The\r\nhorse stood still munching. The leaves hung motionless, the birds were\r\nquiet; all nature seemed to breath in suspended and sympathetic silence\r\nas we ate our lunch hungrily.\r\n\r\nThe great sacrifice these people were making impressed me once more\r\nand I felt appreciative. In no time all three were asleep. In order to\r\nmake it easy for everybody I had an urge to run away, but because of\r\nthe effort these people were making, my conscience would not permit\r\nit. Also probably at the “little place” they knew of, someone might be\r\nwaiting for me.\r\n\r\nThe little brook rumbled on in the quiet of the countryside. It alone\r\ndefied silence. The trees stood in a colored hush of yellow, red and\r\ngreen. The white birch and the trembling aspen beat their wings. All\r\nthis indicated it was early fall and nature was ready for its long\r\nsleep. After taking these details of the setting, I realized I, too,\r\nwas exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe men were harnessing the horse and the woman was packing when I\r\nawoke. She was waiting to fold my blanket. I was chagrined to have been\r\nsuch a poor sentinel, but no harm had resulted. Now the men were ready.\r\nThe woman started for the wagon, so I followed, though I could have\r\nenjoyed nature in that spot indefinitely. In a few minutes I was back\r\nin my coop; the men and the woman were in their places. The wagon bent\r\nforward several times and we were on our way again.\r\n\r\nWe moved steadily and confidently. The way must have been perfectly\r\nfamiliar to our driver. I did not hear any other passing wagons, nor\r\nwas I conscious of passing through any village. I kept thinking about\r\nthe beautiful spot in which we had lunched. That day God and nature\r\nwere fused together. There in that beautiful resting place the family\r\nhad been with me in spirit guiding me in the very air I breathed,\r\ncaressing and encouraging me. I imagined I could hear Father’s quieting\r\nwords. Even now I thought those words might be directing us. The driver\r\nseemed so sure of the way I became less alone, less suffocated, less\r\ndesperate. I could lie quietly. Transcended, I simmered in wishful\r\ndreams. This was the second night on the road. The wagon rumbled.\r\nAnother abrupt turn awakened me. I listened. The horse halted. One of\r\nthe men was opening the door of the coop. He pulled me out and set me\r\non my feet. We were in the midst of a thicket. The third stop on our\r\njourney. It was twilight, the sky still holding its sunset colors. The\r\ncolors faded into the gathering darkness.\r\n\r\nThe men worked hurriedly, nervously and anxiously to get through\r\nfeeding and watering the horse. It was a short stretching period, only\r\nlong enough to eat from our basket and let the horse finish his feed.\r\nNot one word broke the evening silence, not one moment was wasted. Once\r\nmore I lay in the coop and the horse started out again.\r\n\r\nEven in the dark I could feel a certainty of direction. The horse’s\r\nfeet met the ground as if the way was not strange to him. We went on\r\nabout the same pace as during daylight. Each moment I was prepared for\r\nany difficulty which might arise. So far there had been no trouble.\r\nWould we travel all night? I could not sleep in the chilling darkness\r\nand I did not suppose any of the others did. Suddenly a lurch to the\r\nleft, a short run and a halt. No sounds, only poignant stillness. One\r\nof the men helped me out of the cage. I found myself standing beside a\r\nhouse. The woman opened the door and walked in. They all seemed to know\r\nthis house. Though it was dark, they made their way around, and lighted\r\na candle. The woman led me to a bed. After she finished with me, she\r\nwent out of the room.\r\n\r\nIt seemed but a moment before the woman was awakening me from my sleep.\r\nI was getting used to the inevitable. It was still dark when she came\r\nin with a candle in her hand. She guided me to a table where milk and\r\nbread was laid out for me. Then she led me outdoors to the wagon which\r\nstood ready. I could see clearly by the light of the stars.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, we did not stop at the rear of the wagon. We passed to\r\nthe front where one of the men already sat in the driver’s seat. The\r\nsecond man turned as if to help me up. I looked at the woman, seeking\r\nan explanation. She put her lips to my forehead, pressed my hand, then\r\ngently pushed me toward the man who helped me to the seat beside the\r\ndriver. The other man climbed after me. The wagon started, it had two\r\nhorses this time. We had left the woman behind! I suddenly realized the\r\nwoman had said good-bye. I was never to see her again. We turned out of\r\nthe yard, onto the country road. A man on each side of me and the woman\r\ngone. I had misgivings. The men sat rigid, gazing at the pre-dawn\r\nblackness. They were on the alert. To them, leaving the woman behind\r\nwas a planned milestone in their hazardous task. Her part was finished,\r\nnow it was up to them to carry on.\r\n\r\nThe woman was protection to me, the last remnant of a feminine world.\r\nWe were still in danger, judging by their alertness. I wondered why\r\nI had not returned to the coop. These men were stoical and brave to\r\nattempt this journey at all. Their continual watchfulness inspired\r\nconfidence. One of these men had annoyed me with his questions several\r\ndays ago. Now he sat beside me.\r\n\r\nEach moment took me farther away from the woman. I had taken her\r\nprotection for granted. My feeling for her had been a mixture of\r\nwonder and resentment. I always hoped that some day she would talk to\r\nme and tell me what I wanted to know. Now that day was gone forever.\r\nBut she had done her part faithfully and I must be grateful. That last\r\nnight at the dugout, when we looked eye to eye, she understood what\r\nI wanted most. I would have liked to put it in words. That night I\r\nhad felt close to her. Now she was far from me, free to return to her\r\naccustomed way of life. What was her life? On our way, had we dropped\r\nher at her home? This dugout, where I had been so long, was it far from\r\nEkaterinburg?\r\n\r\nThe men spoke of Uktus and Mramorskaya. Was one of these the location\r\nof my dugout? It was an irritating mystery. No part of the mystery was\r\nsolved and now the woman was gone without telling me a thing.\r\n\r\nThe men kept peering through the darkness, taking advantage of its\r\nunlimited screen to make all possible progress. My inner darkness\r\nexceeded the darkness of the night. At length the outer darkness lifted\r\nto herald the coming dawn. Soon the majestic sun appeared unchallenged.\r\nI was cold and numb until a quick turn of the wagon made me forget my\r\nnumbness.\r\n\r\nThe horses halted and the men stood up to stretch. They jumped down and\r\nhelped me to alight. Then handing me the basket and the army blanket,\r\nthey began to unharness the horses. This was the beginning of our\r\nfourth day on the road. I attended to the food while the men cared for\r\nthe horses. The basket contained a fresh supply of food--black bread,\r\neggs and a bottle of water. The woman must have baked the bread for\r\nus, while we were asleep. I found a sunny spot on which to spread the\r\nblanket while we ate.\r\n\r\nWhen we finished they jumped to their feet, folded the blanket and we\r\nwere off again. I climbed to the driver’s seat, where we sat three\r\nabreast. We were a family of peasants driving between work fields. My\r\nfaded clothes fitted perfectly into the scheme. That day the horses\r\nseemed to know the route as well as the driver. They knew all the\r\nbyways. They must have driven these roads frequently. From a hill I\r\ncould see a village in the distance. I did not ask their names and the\r\nmen did not volunteer the information. We did see some people walking\r\non these roads. We also passed a few wagons.\r\n\r\nWhen I noticed that the men were less tense, I assumed we were beyond\r\nthe danger zone. We were all in a more relaxed mood. We stopped in\r\nanother spot and laid out the food, but there was very little left.\r\nThey were so tired, they hardly could eat The meager meal was soon\r\nfinished and they harnessed the horses. One of them took the blanket\r\nand climbed on top of the hay and spread it out. The other man helped\r\nme up; here I was to spend my night. How imperturbable these men were,\r\nso reassuring when I was most afraid. Their thoughtfulness touched me.\r\nNow that the men could not see me, I could shed the tears I had turned\r\nback yesterday. I fell asleep until the wagon halted again. I sat up\r\nin fright. It was a dark night. The stars were quivering. I heard the\r\nstraps fall. The whiffle-tree hit the ground. The horses were stepping\r\nout of their traces. We were to spend the night here. The men stretched\r\noutside beside the wagon.\r\n\r\nWe had been sleeping for a while when I thought I heard a scream of\r\nsome kind. I heard it again. Now it was a shriek, the horses neighed\r\nwith a shrill sound and jerked the wagon to which they were tied. The\r\nmen sprang to their feet and began to pull some hay off the wagon.\r\nThey threw it to the ground and lighted a match to make a fire. Soon\r\nthe horses quieted down. I overheard the men saying there were two\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nAfter this scare it was easy to keep awake. I felt sorry for the men\r\nwho were up and down several times during the night. At last dawn\r\nappeared and I heard them stirring in preparation for a new departure.\r\nI combed my hair, using my fingers for a comb and my palm for a brush,\r\ntrying to make myself as presentable as possible. I knew I did not look\r\nwell groomed but I did not much care. One of the men helped me down\r\nfrom the wagon, the other brought some water and poured it into my\r\nhands. I washed my face without soap. We had spent the night not far\r\nfrom a farmhouse known to my companions.\r\n\r\nWe emerged from the forests into open fields, then another forest.\r\nJudging by the sun I figured we were moving in a southwesterly\r\ndirection. These inscrutable men stopped at another byway for rest and\r\nfood. We ate bread and washed it down with water. Not a word was spoken\r\nduring lunch. Soon we rattled again along the roads and country lanes\r\nwithout any special incident. We met a number of frail men and women,\r\nand barefoot children wearing tattered clothes. We got out of one rut\r\nonly to get into another. The jerks and vibrations were making me ill.\r\n\r\nNow the farms were great distances apart. A shortage of seeds in their\r\nshacks indicated a harsh struggle to raise food and keep the family\r\nwarm. The condition of the country was such that it permitted only a\r\nbare existence. What went on in the big cities could hardly interest\r\nthese peasants. Perhaps these people had not even heard of the massacre\r\nof the thousands of people, of their Emperor and his family. Surely the\r\nchances of meeting with anyone acquainted with the Imperial family must\r\nbe remote. Who could associate this pathetic, toothless, faded creature\r\nbetween these two men with anything royal? I heard later that all the\r\ngrain was taken away from the peasants and many died during the winter\r\nof 1917-18. Now the men talked freely about their journey. They even\r\njoked about their fright. But they exchanged only a few words with me.\r\nThey did not address me nor use my real name or title.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the wagon halted again. It seemed like an eternity\r\nsince the woman had left us. The horses were unharnessed and tied to a\r\ntree. We rested until dawn broke. Now we had no food.\r\n\r\nThey seemed eager to reach the destination. All of a sudden, in the\r\nmid-afternoon, the horses made a sharp turn and we entered an open\r\nstretch with fields and a few trees on a nearby hill. Below, in the\r\ndistance, we could see a village. The horses were unharnessed, hitched\r\nto long ropes so they could graze at will. The men stretched out by the\r\nwagon and soon were sound asleep. I had no idea where we were.\r\n\r\nIn the early evening, the men awakened. They jumped up and shook\r\nthemselves, saying, “Let us get going.” We were leaving the horses and\r\nwagon behind and taking off on foot. They looked back several times to\r\nmake sure the horses were safe. I had become fond of those horses and\r\nhated the thought of leaving them. Soon we were three abreast. We began\r\ndescending the hill, then went up and down several times until we could\r\nsee the village more clearly. One of the men gave the other directions\r\nand then returned to his horses. The second man and I started down the\r\nsmall hill to the village. As I looked back I saw in the dusk only the\r\nfigure of our departed companion going up the hill. Now my hostility\r\ntoward him was lost in the widening distance between us.\r\n\r\nHow long could I walk in my huge and uncomfortable boots? Would my\r\nwounded left leg hold up? In spite of all the care I had received,\r\nit continued to pain. The ground we walked on was rough. It was hard\r\nto keep my feet from sliding around in my boots. It was dark when we\r\nreached the village. Several dogs barked and ran out in the street,\r\nand then turned back to their houses. Here and there in the windows\r\nflickered an occasional candle or a kerosene lamp. All was quiet in\r\nthe streets as if the villagers had turned in for the night. We kept\r\nwalking until we reached a small dimly-lighted house. My companion gave\r\ntwo short knocks on the window and a tall lean man with a cane came to\r\nthe door. He held the door open for us and said, “I have been expecting\r\nyou for the last two nights.” I extended my hand to him. He held it in\r\nboth of his hands, kissed it, and looked into my eyes, without a word.\r\nA tear rolled down his cheek. He stood in silence ... overcome with\r\nemotion, then said; “My dear, you must be tired and hungry after such a\r\ntrying trip.” His voice and words were touching and more friendly and\r\nwarm than I had heard in several months. He drew me to a chair at a\r\ntable and when I was seated the two men sat on either side of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII ALEXANDER\r\n\r\n\r\n“Did you have any trouble getting here?” my host asked.\r\n\r\n“Very little,” answered my companion. “We used a few matches--only\r\nthree are left--to set fire to some hay in order to drive away two\r\nwolves. Matches are scarce these days.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want some?” asked my host, handing him some loose ones.\r\n\r\n“Thanks,” said my companion, “It is very pleasant here, but I must not\r\nstay long.”\r\n\r\n“Marushka,” called our host, “tea, please.”\r\n\r\nImmediately thinly sliced ham with cheese and bread were placed on the\r\ntable, also a small samovar. My host was surprised when I refused the\r\nmeat (a great luxury it was) but since Ekaterinburg I had not been\r\nable to stand the sight of it, remembering the shortage. I felt guilty\r\ntaking sugar in my tea, but my host insisted and I took a lump but did\r\nnot stir the tea in anticipation of a second glass. It was refreshing\r\nto us all.\r\n\r\nAs we finished, my companion said to me, “You are indebted to this\r\ngentleman, not to me. He saved your life.”\r\n\r\nAs if to end such embarrassing conversation, my host stood up and\r\nhanded my companion an old, thick envelope, brown from age. The\r\nenvelope was so thick that I thought it must have contained paper money\r\nand perhaps some jewelry. My companion lifted the flap and glanced\r\ninside it as our host said, “Take some bread and cheese to your\r\nfriend. He must be hungry.”\r\n\r\n“Are you really leaving?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “my part is done.”\r\n\r\nI did not know what he meant, but I did feel confidence in my host.\r\nMeantime I thanked the man for everything he and the others had done\r\nto help me. I began, “There is nothing I can offer you, but my deep,\r\ndeep gratitude and appreciation. In the name of my family and myself, I\r\nthank you for what you have risked for me.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed and was gone. Each good-bye was less of Russia. That part of\r\nmy rescue in the little room beneath the house was over.\r\n\r\nThe man had said that I owed my life to my host. What part had the\r\nlatter played? I did have a sense of security with him. He seemed like\r\none of my own people. I felt I could talk to him freely and find out\r\nwho he was.\r\n\r\n“Is this your house?” I ventured.\r\n\r\n“Yes and no,” he said. “The cottage belongs to a former estate.\r\nMarushka’s husband worked on this farm but now he is missing in the\r\nwar. The woods and fields you crossed were also part of the estate. One\r\nsection used to belong to a family who were relatives of the Giers of\r\nthe Ukraine.”\r\n\r\n“Was there not a governor by that name?” I asked. “I remembered meeting\r\nhim and his daughter.”\r\n\r\n“The very same,” my host agreed, and I felt a common bond with him.\r\n\r\nJust then Marushka came in and announced everything was ready for me. I\r\nthanked my host and followed her.\r\n\r\nThe house contained two rooms besides the kitchen. The host slept in\r\nthe room in which we had tea. Marushka and I occupied the other room.\r\nI slept on a cot, Marushka on a narrow wooden bed next to the wall.\r\nOn a stand stood a basin, a pitcher with water, soap and towel, and a\r\nlantern. I discovered this house, like many others, did not have inside\r\nconveniences.\r\n\r\nNext morning outside the window I saw a vegetable garden. A small dog\r\ncompleted the friendliness of the house. He would sniff around every\r\ntime I bathed the wound on my leg. When I shed a tear, as I washed, he\r\nwould look at me soulfully as if to sympathize. He licked my hands. I\r\nwas drawn to him right away and could not entertain the thought that I\r\nmight have to leave him some day. He followed me everywhere in the day\r\ntime and slept by my cot at night, as if to protect me from danger. You\r\nmight have thought he had always belonged to me.\r\n\r\nIn the morning my host said, “We will not hurry. You need the rest and\r\ntime for your wound to heal better. We will remain here a week or so.”\r\n\r\nI was glad to hear this for he had already made me feel so comfortable\r\nin mind and body that I was glad to wait. He seemed to want to talk.\r\nAfter weeks of silence it was a treat to converse.\r\n\r\nHe said his name was Alexander, that he was an officer during the war.\r\nHe had received the St. George’s Cross for his distinguished service\r\nin the Russian Army. He had also been decorated with the medal of St.\r\nVladimir, 3rd class, usually given to commandants of large units. He\r\nknew my Father’s mother, and on one occasion had met us children at\r\nG.H.Q. when he had come to see Father.\r\n\r\nDuring the war he was wounded in the abdomen and was nursed at the\r\nhospital in Kiev or Rovno where he had met my Aunt Olga. One evening he\r\ntalked of my Father, saying His Majesty was kind, really too kind. He\r\nwas so patient and understanding through his banishment. Only Christ\r\ncould understand his suffering. Their Majesties suffered a long time.\r\nHe bent his head and tears rolled down his cheeks. “It is all finished\r\nfor all of us and for Russia.”\r\n\r\nI remembered my Father’s tears on that final night of July 16th-17th\r\nafter his talk with Yurovsky.\r\n\r\nMy host and I wept together. I breathed a prayer of gratitude to God\r\nfor such a sympathetic and good friend. We had many talks together,\r\nbut we did not touch on the subject so delicate to both of us. For the\r\npresent neither of us felt equal to it. I wanted to hear of my rescue,\r\nyet again I did not, because of my family. He avoided the subject,\r\nfearing the effect the truth might have on me. We did talk of my life\r\nbeneath the house. I told him of the excellent care the woman had given\r\nme, and said I was frightened by the various questions the men asked me.\r\n\r\n“They questioned you?”, he said. “What about?”\r\n\r\n“About my family, the imprisonment,” I answered. He was surprised at\r\nthis news.\r\n\r\n“Do you think they knew who you were?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” I said, “They never came out with it, but, judging from their\r\nquestions, I suspected they had guessed.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must leave immediately,” he said. “There will be trouble.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed agitated and called Marushka to get things ready. It was the\r\nthird evening I had been with my host. Now we must cut short the week\r\nof delay we had both looked forward to.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, long before dawn, my host and I took to the road.\r\nIt was early September, by the Russian calendar. I became aware of the\r\ndate from a calendar hung in Marushka’s room. She used the previous\r\nyear’s calendar, having changed the dates on it. Marushka, weeping as\r\nshe did so often because of the loss of her husband, saw us to the\r\ndoor. We said a quick good-bye, and the little dog stood puzzled. It\r\nwas hard to shut the door in the face of my little friend.\r\n\r\nWe were off. I carried nothing. My host carried a small canvas bag\r\ncontaining some food and a salve for his wound. We walked without\r\nevent, and by late morning we were near a small town. My companion was\r\nquiet. At times he did not seem sure which road we should take. We\r\nrested about an hour; then suddenly he said, “I know now where we are.\r\nI see the church steeple over there.” He began to tell me that he was\r\nfamiliar with this part of the country. After walking several more\r\nhours, we came upon the ruin of a factory. We sat on the fallen bricks\r\nand ate our lunch. We had bread, hard-boiled eggs and a bottle of sour\r\nmilk, and we purchased some apples.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, I knew approximately where we were. Passing the\r\nancient city of Ufa, high up on the banks at the junction of the Ufa\r\nand Belaya Rivers, we had a beautiful view. We could see the vast stone\r\nquarries and stone cutting mills spread before our eyes. There were\r\nmany chimneys, a witness to the size of Russian industries. But no\r\nsmoke came out of them.\r\n\r\nPart of Ufa was inhabited by Bashkirs, but now there were very many\r\nforeigners who were purchasing grain from the government, exchanging\r\nprecious stones and platinum for the food sold or given them by the\r\nBolshevik leaders, while the Russian people were not able to purchase\r\ntheir own products.\r\n\r\nHere we stayed well into the afternoon, when my host surprised me by\r\nsaying, “We are lucky that the train is leaving on this day. We will\r\ntake the train from Ufa.”\r\n\r\nWe remembered that the depot was on the other side of the town, but\r\nwhen we reached it, we found no train there. We were told that the\r\ntrain had stopped farther down the track. We followed the track for a\r\ndistance until we found the train standing. There were many peasants\r\nbut the foreigners with their loot were boarding it first; some of\r\nthe peasants even got up on the roofs of the cars. We finally managed\r\nto get into the doorway, but had to stand up all night. There were\r\nfacilities on the train, but the rest rooms were packed with people.\r\n\r\nWe were afraid to get off the train for fear of not being able to get\r\nback on again. Our next stop was a small town named Bugulma. Here we\r\nchanged to another train to go on to Simbirsk (since renamed Ulianov,\r\nafter that heinous Tsederbaum-Ulianov-Lenin). We saw the Volga River\r\nat one of its most beautiful spots, the picturesque city of Simbirsk\r\nlying high on the bank, its many church steeples spread out before\r\nus. Suddenly I remembered what Miss Rita Khitrovo, former lady in\r\nwaiting, had said of her ancestors, who had founded Simbirsk, and how\r\nwe had hoped to make a trip to this historic city when the war was\r\nover. Palisades had been constructed here by the Boyar Khitrovo in the\r\nseventeenth century to defend the city from the Tartars.\r\n\r\nEvery Russian knew the song “Stenka Razin” about the famous Volga River\r\nrobber, and that the many legends about him originated here. We saw\r\nthe monument dedicated to the Russian historian, Karamzin. At Nicholas\r\nGarden, Alexander pointed out to me the Club of the Noblesse.\r\n\r\nSeeing all this I felt a great pain in my chest. We passed the Convent\r\nof the Redeemer. I begged Alexander to let me enter it, since no one\r\nwould know my identity. Alexander refused to listen to me, saying that\r\nmany priests and nuns had already been driven out of convents, and many\r\nhad been killed. It was no time to remain in Russia. It was dangerous;\r\nit might betray our whereabouts. So I had to be content with a prayer\r\nevery time we passed a church. The sight of those holy sanctuaries\r\nlifted my spirits and calmed my nerves.\r\n\r\nAlexander seemed to know this city, for without hesitation we walked\r\nsome distance from the station to a wooden gate leading to a small\r\nhouse. He knocked on the door and an attractive lady of some forty\r\nyears opened the door. Her name was Alexandra. They were happy to see\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n“You look tired,” were her words of greetings.\r\n\r\n“I am,” he said, “my side is troubling me.”\r\n\r\n“You need a rest, I will have tea ready in a minute.” She invited us to\r\nsit down.\r\n\r\n“Nikolai will be back any minute; he will bring some bread,” she said.\r\n“Usually the bread line is quite long and one must start very early in\r\nthe morning.”\r\n\r\nI was not prepared to find such a lovely lady in this house. I wondered\r\nwho she was and what her relationship to my host could be. She was\r\nvery aristocratic looking. Soon Nikolai, dressed shabbily in civilian\r\nclothes, like Alexander, arrived with a loaf of bread tucked under his\r\narm. I could see he was a warm friend of Alexander. He was delighted to\r\nsee us and said he had rather expected us. He and Alexander chatted at\r\nlength while we drank our tea.\r\n\r\nAs we finished, he turned suddenly to Alexander and asked, “How did you\r\never happen to go to E.K. (that is, Ekaterinburg)?”\r\n\r\nAlexander answering at length: “I wanted to join Admiral Kolchak’s\r\narmy but was arrested and put in prison for a time. While there, I\r\nhad a fresh attack and they let me out of prison. Instead of going\r\nto a hospital, I went to Ekaterinburg. There I met a priest by the\r\nname of Father Storozhev whom I visited several times. He informed\r\nme of the desperate condition at the Ipatiev House. It seemed he had\r\nbeen summoned to conduct a service there and was alarmed about the\r\nconsequences. He suggested I contact a man by the name of Voykov, who\r\nwas in charge of hiring the guards and other workers. I applied as a\r\nworker, but did not get the job.\r\n\r\n“One day I went to the guard house next to the Ipatiev House where\r\nI became friendly with the guards through a guard whom I had met\r\npreviously and with whom I later played chess. I returned to the guard\r\nhouse several times. Some of the guards were jolly but rough; most of\r\nthe outside guards were Russians, former convicts. They did not object\r\nto my presence. They remained guarding the house to the last. The\r\ninside guards, I was told, were replaced by foreigners two weeks before\r\nthe tragedy.”\r\n\r\nAlexander was right; they were foreigners, mostly ex-prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nIt was as if Alexander were taking the opportunity to tell Nikolai, in\r\nfront of me, what had happened. He felt that I ought to know.\r\n\r\n“I saw Father Storozhev a few days before the night of July 16-17th,”\r\nhe continued. “I went to the guard house again, after dark, because the\r\npriest had given me a feeling of danger. I did not tell him where I was\r\ngoing nor did I see him again. When I came upon the guards with whom I\r\nplayed chess, I saw most of them had been drinking heavily.\r\n\r\n“They asked me to drink a toast to Comrade Yurovsky; he sent the liquor\r\nin appreciation for their services. I refused to take anything pointing\r\nto my wound. ‘Never mind, tovarishch,’ one of the guards said. ‘More\r\nwill be left for us. You are sick and only good for the dogs.’ They\r\nseemed to be drowning something in drink. I am sure they were not aware\r\nof the forthcoming murder. I began to feel uneasy and feared there was\r\nreal danger. I was afraid to leave the place. I wished I had four or\r\nfive armed men with me. After dinner it was announced that no one would\r\nbe allowed to leave or enter the place. They looked at me and said\r\njokingly, ‘We have a new prisoner.’\r\n\r\n“Some of the guards left drunk for their various posts. With several\r\nother guards I entered the courtyard. I heard a truck drive up to the\r\nhouse about eleven P.M. I offered the truck driver to help him back up\r\nthe truck. He accepted my offer. It flashed through my mind that this\r\ntruck might be for the purpose of secretly taking the family away.\r\nAfter a while the driver fell asleep, giving me the opportunity to get\r\ninto the back of the truck. I lay down flat in the back of the truck.\r\nImagine the shock when I felt warm, twitching objects thrown next to\r\nme. I knew then what had actually happened.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Alexander burst into tears. I ran out of the room. I had\r\nbeen hoping he would say that some of my family were still alive, but\r\nhe denied it with his tears.\r\n\r\nOnly twice was the subject again brought up, once by Alexander and\r\nlater by Nikolai who told me the rest of Alexander’s heroic rescue.\r\nFrom fear, Alexander remained in the truck, horror stricken and unable\r\nto move, realizing his dangerous position. He had no choice but to lie\r\nthere quietly next to still warm and twitching bodies. If discovered,\r\nhe too would have been shot. That night most of the guards were drunk.\r\nThe truck moved rapidly out of the courtyard through the streets and\r\nthen slowly over the bumpy country roads, the wheels sliding out of\r\none deep rut into another. Suddenly Alexander heard a moan among the\r\nbodies. As the truck turned at the bend of the road, he picked up\r\ntwo bodies and tossed them into the bushes. The guards on horseback\r\nbeing far behind, Alexander jumped into a ditch and lay among the\r\nbushes until he knew they had passed. Returning to the bodies, he\r\nquickly examined them. One appeared to be lifeless. He wrapped the\r\nlive one with his coat and carried it a long way to the first house\r\nhe could find. It was the house with the dugout underneath. Alexander\r\ntook notice of the location, which was in the vicinity of Uktus and\r\nMramorskaya. The long walk with the heavy burden caused his wound to\r\nrupture, and infection set in on the side of his abdomen. He was ill\r\nand soaked in blood, not knowing what to do. He took a chance in asking\r\nunknown strangers to care for me, offering them a generous reward.\r\nIf these people had known from the beginning who I was, they would\r\nprobably have refused to care for me for fear of being discovered. One\r\nof these men kept Alexander informed of my condition. This explained\r\nwhy our journey from our little hiding place to Alexander’s cottage was\r\nso dangerous. I told Alexander and Nikolai about having some valuables\r\nsewn in my clothes. They said that that was perhaps another reason\r\nwhy my clothes had been burned and why they cared for me the way they\r\ndid. They were well paid. Alexander also paid them through the brown\r\nenvelope. How much was in it, I did not ask. He did say that I was\r\nfully clothed when he delivered me to the house and that my clothes\r\nwere soaked in blood, probably from that of the others as well as my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the dugout, I carried with me only the blood-stained\r\nhandkerchief, the piece of blue glass, and my soul. If any one is still\r\nalive from among those who were with us in Tobolsk, he would recognize\r\nthe handkerchief as the one seen in Tobolsk.\r\n\r\nAlexander said nothing about leaving Simbirsk. I took it for granted\r\nthat we would be moving on, but was grateful for the respite in which\r\nto get hold of myself. All I had heard had unnerved me. I suspected\r\nAlexander needed a rest for our strenuous trip ahead. On the evening of\r\nour third day a truck drove up. Alexander and I said good-bye to Mlle.\r\nAlexandra and were on our way again.\r\n\r\nAlexander sat on the front seat with Nikolai, and I sat in the back\r\non the straw-covered floor of the truck. We drove through the night\r\nwith only the customary stops in wooded spots for rest and to change\r\ndrivers, Alexander seemed unusually thoughtful; he was continually\r\ntrying to spare Nikolai and me all he could. He made attempts at light\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“We missed the hottest month of the year; it is usually in July, and\r\nJanuary is the coldest,” he said.\r\n\r\nI learned the truck belonged to a factory in Kursk, where Nikolai was\r\nemployed by the new government in some industrial capacity, and the\r\ntruck was to be delivered there. We continued our journey in the truck\r\nuntil late in the afternoon, when we stopped in a wooded spot with\r\ntall poplars, birches, walnut and elm trees which grew profusely in\r\nthis area near Penza. We rested a while and then proceeded toward the\r\ncity, an old historical site. We made some purchases of food here,\r\nalthough the prices were prohibitive. Alexander noticed a woman selling\r\nshawls. He approached her and asked for the price. It was so high that\r\nhe glanced at me disappointedly--he knew I was cold as I had no coat.\r\nThe woman came close to me and stared into my eyes. I was frightened.\r\nShe said she would take only one-fourth of the price she had first\r\nasked. She selected the best one and placed it on my shoulders. When we\r\nleft, I turned back for a glance at her; she was making a cross in our\r\ndirection. Alexander hurried away, as I limped along next to him. At\r\nthe time the cruel murder of the Imperial family was already known in\r\nRussia. Here we met people of many races, Tartars, Buriats, Kirghiz and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe passed a lovely square with beautiful trees where the Lermontov\r\nmonument stood. Descending, we passed Sadovaya Avenue. It reminded me\r\nof the Sadovaya in Tsarskoe Selo. The canal, the pond, the orangeries,\r\nthe Chinese Village, the Siberian blue bridge and the palace all came\r\nto my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe truck rolled on. Nikolai glanced at me. I knew he felt sorry for\r\nme. Both men watched me tenderly giving every kindness to make up for\r\nthe loss I had had some weeks ago. I was appreciative of all their\r\nattentions and hoped to cause them no unnecessary trouble.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed Tambov, Alexander said he had some friends in Voronezh;\r\nperhaps we could get a little rest there. We arrived in Voronezh in the\r\nafternoon and stopped in front of the Convent of St. Mitrophanes. With\r\nmy companions’ consent, I walked into the convent and asked if I might\r\nrest there for a few hours, while Alexander and Nikolai went to see\r\ntheir friends and a doctor. Here the kind nuns washed my clothes and\r\nprepared a hot bath for me, washed my hair, and dressed the sores on my\r\nleg which looked infected.\r\n\r\nIn about three hours, when I was ready to leave, they packed some food\r\nfor us, all they could spare. While I prayed with the nuns, I was\r\nseized by a most extraordinary feeling. Three times I felt a breeze\r\nflying over my shoulders. My lips froze, I turned around and sensed\r\nnothing. In my mind I saw my family in the church in Tsarskoe Selo,\r\nentering through the small side door the Feodorovsky Sobor where we\r\nprayed with our beloved escort. The choir in the Feodorovsky Sobor\r\nwith its beautiful voices sang throughout with such perfection that\r\none wished it would never come to an end. I also saw my loved ones in\r\nTobolsk in the winter church. Coming back to present surroundings, I\r\nrealized that I stood alone among a few humble women. There was only\r\na murmur of voices within these sacred walls. I thanked God for the\r\nkindness I had received in this convent. My heart found peace and I\r\nfelt refreshed. I often wondered if they knew who their guest was.\r\n\r\nAs I came out of the convent, I was horrified to see Alexander\r\napproaching, his face pale, grief-stricken and excited. He said, “There\r\nis no use going to the Crimea. I have just heard from responsible\r\nsources that your Grandmother, both aunts, their husbands, and all\r\ntheir children have been killed. We also learned from a relative\r\nthat Vostorgov (a high clergyman in Moscow), together with a great\r\nmany others, were assassinated last month. Among them were the young\r\nMinisters Maklakov and Khvostov, who had replaced the old Minister\r\nGoremykin, Minister of the Interior.”\r\n\r\nThat Khvostov’s wife, Anastasia, had been shot in Moscow, I had learned\r\npreviously. I could not cry but shook as if in a state of fever. All\r\nthis distressing news pointed out our own danger. I had hoped that in a\r\nweek I would be in the Crimea with my relatives.\r\n\r\nWe heard, too, what had happened in Sevastopol. The revolutionists\r\nhad killed and tied stones to the feet of the young cadets and thrown\r\nthem into the Black Sea. Their disappearance was a mystery until a\r\nyoung woman on her way to market saw some bodies and reported them.\r\nShe was turned away from the scene and was not allowed to enter the\r\nstreet where the bodies were seen. Later a diver went down and came up\r\nscreaming. “They are alive and walking on the bottom of the sea,” he\r\nclaimed. He had lost his mind. A second diver discovered the bodies\r\nwere upright; heavy stones were tied to their feet and the waving\r\nmotion of water made them look as if they were walking.\r\n\r\nOnly fate helped me to listen with fortitude to this heartrending news\r\nabout my relatives. Later I learned that the report about them was not\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nAlexander had also heard that late one night in June, 1918, Uncle Misha\r\nand his English secretary, Nicholas Johnson (who thought his presence\r\nmight help the Grand Duke), were taken away into the woods near Perm,\r\nand mysteriously disappeared. Unfortunately they had been executed, as\r\nI learned much later.\r\n\r\nFather was right, the taste of blood begets an epidemic.\r\n\r\nHaving heard all this about the Crimea, we knew that going there was\r\nout of the question, so we did not, as originally planned, go through\r\nTula, which, I was told, seemed like our best route. We went instead\r\nto Kursk where Nikolai delivered the truck. While he was delivering it,\r\nwe purchased some food. The price of bread was not so exorbitant, but\r\nwe paid outrageous prices for the other products. Now we were headed\r\nfor the Rumanian border.\r\n\r\nWhen we first started this trip we passed mountainous fir-clad\r\ncountry--with many ravines. Now the country was much flatter and\r\ndotted with many granaries. We walked through forests and cut through\r\nthe muddy wheat fields. We rested, then walked some more. We slept in\r\nfarmers’ sheds on straw, glad of any place to keep dry, as it rained\r\nalmost every day. We crossed railroad tracks, we saw rusty freight\r\ncars full of sacks of wheat. All were moldy, and the wheat was growing\r\nthrough the burlap sacks while the people were starving, forbidden to\r\ntake this grain. Later on, when we ran out of food, Alexander bought\r\nsome wheat from a farmer and both men ate a little of it. I would have\r\neaten some, too, if I could have chewed it. The grain swelled inside\r\nof them and both men were uncomfortable, drinking water whenever they\r\ncould. We heard that many had died who had eaten raw wheat.\r\n\r\nWe were not far from Kremenchug (on the east bank of the Dnieper)\r\nwhere, according to a letter we had received in Tobolsk, Lili Dehn was\r\nliving. I would have liked to join her. Fighting was going on in the\r\narea. We continued our westward trek.\r\n\r\nMany citizens in order to disguise their identity lived in charred\r\nrailway cars. The walls were patched with canvas, the only protection\r\nagainst cold and heat. Many children were born on these cars, and\r\ndied there as a result of exposure and lack of food. No one claimed\r\nthe bodies of the dead which were buried in shallow graves near the\r\nrailroad tracks. Many grain elevators were filled with charred corpses.\r\nThe foreigners seemed well-fed and well-dressed; they received all the\r\nbest attention. This was the “liberty” that Kerensky--and later the\r\nBolsheviks--had championed, polluting the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nAs we continued on our way Nikolai and I noticed that Alexander was\r\nlagging behind. Nikolai stopped to examine him and found a pus spot on\r\nhis shirt, just below his waistline on the left side. His wound was\r\ninfected again. Fortunately, he had an effective salve with him which\r\nthey applied and then bandaged the wound. We hoped that it would tide\r\nhim over until we could get to a doctor. We gathered some leaves and\r\nmade a bed for him. I put my shawl over him as he stretched out on the\r\nwet leaves. Nikolai and I sat beside him, hoping he would be able to\r\nreach the next village. I would have given my right arm and eye to save\r\nthis good friend.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised to learn from the crackling noise of branches that\r\nthere were other people in these woods. The footsteps came closer and\r\nsuddenly two men walked up to us. They seemed to be afraid of us. When\r\nthey saw us they started to go back in the same direction they came\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\n“Come and join us,” said Nikolai in a friendly tone of voice.\r\n\r\n“Is anything the matter?”, asked one of the men in a language we\r\nrecognized as Serbian.\r\n\r\n“Our friend’s wound has opened and is infected,” said Nikolai, “and we\r\ndo not know what to do.”\r\n\r\nThe Serbian, in broken Russian, suggested that, when night came, we\r\ntake our patient to the nearest house. He volunteered to look for and\r\nfind a house. While we waited for his return, we talked with the other\r\nman and found that he was a Croatian. The two of them had not been able\r\nto get on the train in Kursk and had started to walk to the border.\r\nBoth had been officers in the last war. One fought on our side, the\r\nother fought on the enemy’s side. Now they were on their way to their\r\nrespective homes.\r\n\r\nThe Serbian returned in about an hour. He had located a house not too\r\nfar away. At dusk the Serbian and Nikolai helped Alexander to his feet\r\nand supported him all the way to the house.\r\n\r\nIt was a thatched-roof, white-washed house in which a young woman about\r\nthirty-five years old lived with her four children. The little boy,\r\nfive years old, with his blond curly hair and big gray eyes reminded\r\nme very much of Alexei at that age. I was drawn to him at first sight,\r\nespecially when he looked at our invalid and asked, “Is the father\r\nill?” His own father had been wounded in the war and they hoped he\r\nwould get home soon. He imagined that his father had been ill the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSmall as the house was, we all spent the night there. We two women\r\nslept in one room with all the children, the men in the other room.\r\nBy morning our invalid felt much better. We lingered all day to make\r\nsure that he was capable of continuing the trip. The woman was most\r\ngenerous. She shared with us her scanty food. To avoid the heat of\r\nthe day the Serbian and the Croatian planned to start on their way\r\nin the early evening. When Alexander heard about their leaving, he\r\ninsisted that Nikolai and I go with them. We protested, but he said\r\nhis temperature was normal and the little mother promised to give\r\nhim the best of care. He assured us everything would be easier if we\r\nobeyed him. Finally we were convinced and reluctantly left him with the\r\npromise that as soon as we were over the border, Nikolai would come\r\nback for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when an opportunity presented itself, it must not be rejected. The\r\nfour of us struck out on foot about ten in the evening. I cried all\r\nnight, recognizing that we had left our dear friend to die when he\r\nneeded us most. We walked all night until the next noon, through wheat\r\nfields, hoping to find some peasant home where we could get some food.\r\nWe had had our last meal just before we left the peasant woman. On the\r\nway we had no breakfast or lunch, and not enough money for train fare,\r\nnor did Nikolai and I have documents to permit our crossing of the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nIt became unbearably hot. A good farmer provided us with food and\r\nshelter for the night. We slept till the following morning, then\r\nstarted out again. The farmer’s news was most alarming. He said that\r\nthe war was continuing. Socialism was spreading to Austria and Germany.\r\nCrimes were increasing daily. Criminals were even crossing the border\r\nto Russian territory to commit their killings and robbings.\r\n\r\nA third prisoner, who had been in the Austrian army, was the last to\r\njoin us. He had a supply of food which he shared with us. As we came\r\ncloser to the border, the number of refugees increased, and there was\r\nmore apprehension. Nikolai expressed fears that we might be turned away\r\nfrom the border, or might even be put into prison. I was prepared for\r\nany eventuality. One thing I was sure of: I would never let anyone know\r\nwho I was.\r\n\r\nWe finally emerged from that gruesome forest. We crossed a small stream\r\nwhere we drank some water and filled our bottle. As we continued our\r\njourney, the Serbian officer began to question me. He asked me so many\r\nquestions, I was afraid he was suspicious. Nikolai, too, became anxious\r\nabout these conversations. He said he would go ahead and walk with the\r\nSerbian to find out what was in his mind; in the meantime I walked with\r\nthe Croatian and the former Austrian soldier. Finally Nikolai returned,\r\nsatisfied and said, “He knows the facts, but will not betray us, I am\r\nsure.” The Serbian was a loyal friend, offering considerable protection\r\nto me all the way. When we were near the border, he scouted ahead to\r\nsee what could be done to make the crossing successfully. Nikolai\r\nmade an arrangement with the Austrian soldier as to where, in case of\r\nseparation, he could find us.\r\n\r\nWe were in constant sight of many refugees in rags, the children\r\nundernourished, thin and ill. We heard that the German armies were\r\nstill in Kiev. We saw troop trains going by. Many people were on the\r\nway to the border, wearing garments partly military, partly civilian.\r\nPeople were being arrested because they had no passports. Our latest\r\ncompanion was helpful in directing us to the border. He had fought on\r\nthe Austrian front and was himself on his way to Bukovina. Now we were\r\nfive, approaching dangerous territory. Two had been prisoners of war\r\nand had the necessary documents for crossing the line. The Serbian had\r\nhis papers. It was suggested that I pose as the wife of one of them for\r\nthe purpose of entering Rumania. The Serbian would not do; the Croatian\r\nwould be better. He had been on the German side. Nikolai would be my\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nAt this time we were tired and hungry. We had not eaten in the past\r\ntwenty-four hours. We located another peasant who furnished us with\r\nfood but was not able to give us lodging.\r\n\r\nNikolai spotted a haystack. I climbed on top and covered myself with\r\nhay. The four men slept at the base of it. I was sound asleep when I\r\nwas suddenly awakened by a terrific clap of thunder. The rain began to\r\npour. The lightning was frightening. The men called to me to come down.\r\nBy the time I slid down to the bottom, my clothes were soaking wet. All\r\nfive of us dug our way into the hay and remained there huddled, warm\r\nand steamy until we fell asleep. It must have rained for hours, coming\r\ndown in sheets. When we were ready to walk again, the fields were a\r\nmass of mud and water. My ankle bothered me considerably. Poor Nikolai\r\ncarried me over the mudholes, up to his knees in water. Many times we\r\nwere glad that our invalid friend was not with us; he could never have\r\nsurvived the strenuous trip. Every time I stepped, mud oozed out of my\r\nboots and my leg hurt. On top of all the trouble I was seized with a\r\nterrible itch all over my body, adding a great deal of discomfort to\r\nthe usual fatigue. Squirming around in my loose-fitting garments did\r\nnot relieve the itch. Now something new had to be endured. All this\r\nmay have been due to some poisonous weed in the hay. I was miserable\r\nand hungry, having had no food all day. It was decided that in case of\r\nseparation at the border, Nikolai would follow with Alexander in four\r\nor five weeks, and that he could find me through the Austrian soldier.\r\n\r\nI had given Nikolai endless messages to give to Alexander. I wanted\r\nAlexander to know how grateful I was and how close I felt toward him,\r\nfor saving my life. It was hard to say good-bye to Nikolai since he\r\nwas the last link with my beloved Russia. I wanted to throw my arms\r\naround him and say a prayer of thankfulness for all the sacrifices\r\nhe and Alexander had made for me. I felt sure in my heart that the\r\nseparation was to come soon. He warned me not to cry in case his escape\r\nshould fail, but to walk away as if I were following my husband. As\r\nwe continued through the muddy fields, we found some tiny potatoes,\r\nwhich the rains had washed to the surface. We rubbed off the soil and\r\nate them raw. At dusk we were practically at the border. The Ukraine\r\nwas still occupied by Germany. It was our luck; one month later the\r\nuprising was in full swing in Germany.\r\n\r\nMy face was swollen and covered with small red pimples.\r\n\r\nThe Serbian had just returned from a scouting search when suddenly we\r\nheard the command, “Halt. Where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“We are going to a doctor,” answered Nikolai.\r\n\r\n“All of you? And for what?” said the guard.\r\n\r\n“Look at the lady for our answer,” said Nikolai.\r\n\r\n“It looks like cholera. Who are you?” asked the guard.\r\n\r\n“Her brother,” said Nikolai, and the Croatian assured the guard that\r\nhe was my husband. Three of them, the Serbian, the Croatian, and the\r\nAustrian soldier produced their papers.\r\n\r\nFacing Nikolai, the guard persisted, “Where are you from?”\r\n\r\n“The village over there,” answered Nikolai, pointing back. “There are\r\nwhole families ill, all needing medical care. When we obtain some drugs\r\nwe will return to the village. We must locate a doctor soon.”\r\n\r\n“What doctor?” asked the guard.\r\n\r\n“There used to be a doctor over the bridge,” said the Serbian, pointing\r\nstraight ahead.\r\n\r\n“But you cannot go that way. It is under German occupation. Do you\r\nreally know a doctor?”\r\n\r\n“We’ll surely find one.” Nikolai retorted.\r\n\r\n“But you absolutely cannot cross here,” said the guard pointing to\r\nNikolai.\r\n\r\n“How far are you going?” the guard turned to the Croatian. “How soon\r\nwill you be back?” he inquired. “You are all right, but where are your\r\nwife’s papers?”\r\n\r\n“Does she need papers to see a doctor?”\r\n\r\nThe questions were answered, but no one heard or cared what they\r\nwere--we were all but drowned in the terrific rain.\r\n\r\n“All right, go on.” said the guard at last with a gesture of\r\nhopelessness, “but be back in one hour.” He turned to Nikolai saying,\r\n“Not you!”\r\n\r\nSo only four of us crossed the bridge. The flimsy, temporary structure\r\nshook as we did so. We glanced into the waters below but saw nothing\r\nin the darkness. All nature was angry.\r\n\r\nI had made a cross in the air as Nikolai and we others parted in the\r\ndark. Only his shadow was running away, in order to escape the guard. I\r\nprayed to God that He might spare him and that Alexander, Nikolai, and\r\nI would meet again.\r\n\r\nNow we were to face a new hazard. As we approached the demarcation\r\nline several soldiers approached us, asking where we were going. The\r\ntwo former prisoners of war spoke German and presented to the guards\r\ntheir papers. They were in order. Turning to me, the Croatian said that\r\nI was his wife. The Serbian, too, showed his papers. After hours of\r\nconversation and questionings and waiting, an officer arrived to say\r\nthat everything was in order. I was to be permitted to enter Bukovina.\r\n\r\nNow I was having my last look toward my troubled country, leaving it to\r\nthe darkness of night.\r\n\r\nWhen this long journey had started I had had no real wish to leave\r\nmy country. I was ill in body and soul. I needed rest and quiet. My\r\nresistance was low. I wished for security. Willy-nilly, I went along\r\nwith my early companions, then with Alexander and Nikolai, and lately\r\nwith my new acquaintances.\r\n\r\nWith quivering lips, I had now left behind me the land I loved so much,\r\nand, somewhere in the wilderness, the remains of my beloved family.\r\nThere were, also, Alexander and Nikolai. With deep feeling I had left\r\nall the tragedies behind.\r\n\r\nGod wanted it that way--to lay their swords and their lives at the\r\naltar of their country. May He grant them rest in Heaven. Father\r\ndeparted with his family very young, but in true Christian faith and\r\nfidelity to Russia. Now free from the cruel human lies, injustices and\r\nmisunderstandings, he left the world not in pomp and glory, but in\r\ngreater glory. He died for his country and his people whom he loved\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts in my mind I left behind the land of my heritage\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV REFUGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rain came down in torrents and washed my tears from my sunken\r\ncheeks. Now I was alone with strangers. As we walked away from the\r\nborder, we were drenched, hungry, and tired, with no prospect of a\r\nplace to sleep. We spied a faint light ahead and hurried toward it.\r\nThe man of the house would not accept Russian paper money. At that\r\npoint the Austrian soldier produced some of his money, which he had\r\nbeen saving, and bargained with the proprietor for us to stay briefly,\r\nhoping that I would feel better quickly. I consulted the woman whom\r\nwe also saw about my itching. She suggested pouring sour milk over a\r\nbed sheet and rolling me in it. This she did so completely that only\r\nmy eyes and mouth were left uncovered. The only unaffected parts of my\r\nbody were the palms of my hands and soles of my feet. This treatment\r\nbrought great comfort and relief. My leg was better, though still\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\nI was ready to resume my travel. The woman provided us with sufficient\r\nfood to last for several days’ journey. She also gave me some rags\r\nwith which I wrapped my feet so that they would not slide around in\r\nmy boots. We passed many wheat fields and woods of tall oak trees;\r\nmany had been uprooted and were lying dead, leaving big holes in the\r\nground which were now filled with water and mud. The trenches were\r\nuncovered and deserted and the rain made rivers of them. The war had\r\nturned this area into a battleground. We could see pieces of clothing,\r\nbrass artillery shell cases, chains, pieces of iron and other odds and\r\nends of metal buried in the trunks of trees--mute testimony to the\r\ndestructive power of artillery. Tragedy was all around us. Rains had\r\nwashed away the traces of blood shed here during the past four years.\r\nSuddenly I spied a geranium plant in the midst of the holocaust. Here\r\nand there were pieces of blankets and abandoned, rusty canteens.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, here something gave away under my feet, uncovering\r\nsome leaves. I screamed. It was a pair of feet--the flesh was all\r\ngone, just bones. They fell apart under the impact of my weight. The\r\nothers responding to my scream came over and removed the leaves from\r\nthe sunken body of a Russian soldier. His uniform was so rotted and\r\nstained, it was impossible to tell that he was an officer, but a rusty\r\nwatch was still wrapped around his wrist bone. The woods showed all\r\nkinds of tragedies.\r\n\r\nFather knew this battlefield as he himself had been shelled several\r\ntimes while inspecting the troops. For this he and Alexei received\r\ntheir St. George decorations. Father had had his to the last day. He\r\nknew the devotion and bravery of his men, those heroes who sacrificed\r\neverything. In the end they, too, paid with their lives, making room\r\nfor Lenin and Trotsky.\r\n\r\nThe day before the war in 1914, I dreamed that woods like these I had\r\njust crossed were in flames, the fire was red and went high up to the\r\nsky. I heard the crackling of the trees. I knew then that the war was\r\nunavoidable, especially when in the evening for the first time Father\r\nappeared late for dinner. Now I recalled my dream as I saw this place\r\nof suffering. In distress I left the touching scene.\r\n\r\nThe men carried me through the deep mudholes, taking turns. I worried\r\nthat I was too heavy. Actually I weighed only forty kilograms, not\r\nquite ninety pounds. The latest companion to join us, the Austrian\r\nsoldier, had been stationed in these parts with the Austrian army and\r\nknew well the nearby villages. Moreover, he himself came from this part\r\nof the country. He volunteered to be our guide. A day or two later, in\r\nthe afternoon, we came to a stretch of woods where we saw some women\r\npicking yellow mushrooms.\r\n\r\nA young woman among them already had her baskets full. We spoke to the\r\nyoung woman who said she was going home, part way to the nearby village.\r\n\r\nWe joined her. The men carried her baskets. The odor of these mushrooms\r\nbrought back gnawing memories. Toward the end of the day, we reached\r\nthe village. The Austrian soldier knew this village, having relatives\r\nhere. Through him we were able to be taken care of for the night. He\r\nwent into the house while we waited outside. An elderly woman came out\r\nand in a Slavic language I understood, said, “Come in, my child, I hear\r\nyou have an injured foot. I know you are hungry. I will have supper\r\nready for you in a minute.” She seemed so clean and kind and motherly,\r\nI was drawn to her immediately. We followed her into the house and\r\nthere we met her daughters who also welcomed us.\r\n\r\nI sat on a low stool shivering, while one of the girls took off my\r\nmuddy boots and the other brought pails of water from outdoors which\r\nthey poured into a large kettle on the wood-burning stove. My muddy\r\nstockings were stuck to my feet. Warm water was poured over them to\r\ntake off the worst of the plastered mud. The mother took a sharp\r\nknife and scraped some salt into a fresh pail of warm water to serve\r\nas disinfectant. By the time we finished with my foot, the supper\r\nwas ready. It consisted of warm mamaliga--a yellow mush made out of\r\nmaize--with warm milk poured over it. It was a new dish to me, but\r\nnothing ever tasted better.\r\n\r\nThe mother examined my wound. While she washed it a tear dropped on my\r\nankle. Our eyes met. “I think it will be all right, I do not see any\r\ninfection.”\r\n\r\nThe warm milk soon stopped the chattering of my teeth. The good girls\r\nhad already made up a bed for me: a small wooden bed with linen sheets\r\nspread over a narrow mattress. They had hardly left the room when I\r\nwas fast asleep. The girls shared the same room with me, but I was not\r\naware of them. When I woke up the next day, the girls told me that the\r\nmen had been waiting for me since eleven in the morning.\r\n\r\n“What time is it now?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Four in the afternoon,” they laughed. “Several times the men came in\r\nand looked to see if you were asleep or dead, and were reassured.”\r\n\r\nEvidently I felt safe at last. The girls told me excitedly that the\r\nmen had slept in the barn and later had helped their mother clean the\r\nstable. The Germans had left her one horse and one cow, confiscating\r\nall the rest of the livestock before the Russian invasion, fearing that\r\nthe Russians would take it.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to dress, to my surprise I could not find my wet\r\ntravelling clothes. Instead of my clothes I found a new outfit:\r\neverything from a cotton dress to a pair of shoes. This humble family\r\nhad presented me with Sunday clothes belonging to their youngest\r\ndaughter, six months my junior.\r\n\r\nI located the men in the garden eating half-dried plums still on the\r\ntrees. They were relaxed, free and happy after getting me safely across\r\nthe border.\r\n\r\nI, too, was relaxed and free.\r\n\r\nAt long last I had found a peaceful refuge with this unknown but\r\nfriendly family which had taken me into its midst and made me a welcome\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nIt was October 24th, 1918 ... for me a new day ... and the beginning of\r\na new life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abalak Monastery, 207, 229, 231\r\n\r\n  Ai-Todor, 50, 177, 239\r\n\r\n  Alapaevsk, 110\r\n\r\n  Alexander I Pavlovich, Emperor, 48, 49, 79\r\n\r\n

A member of a close-knit family, the Grand Duchess was\r\n educated--as were her three sisters and her brother, the Tsesarevich\r\n Alexei--by private tutors, Russian, English and Swiss.\r\n\r\n She accompanied her Family on several trips abroad and on numerous\r\n trips within the country, including extensive travel in 1913--a year\r\n widely celebrated in Russia as the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the\r\n ascension to the throne of the first Romanov, Michael Feodorovich.\r\n\r\n After the escape of the Grand Duchess Anastasia from Russia--the\r\n point at which the present volume ends--she lived for short periods\r\n in Rumania and Yugoslavia and for many years in the United States,\r\n principally in Illinois and Wisconsin. She is now an American citizen\r\n and is currently living in New York City.\r\n\r\n A future volume, on which she is working, will deal with her life and\r\n experiences in the post-escape years.\r\n\r\n A lover of animals, the Grand Duchess is now completing a short book\r\n entitled _My Friends: the Dogs_, all of the royalties from which will\r\n be contributed to animal shelters and organizations devoted to the\r\n health and well-being of dogs.\r\n\r\n The Grand Duchess Anastasia is creating a foundation which will\r\n establish and maintain a museum devoted to Russian culture and\r\n containing a chapel in memory of her Family. A substantial portion\r\n of her royalties from her autobiography will be turned over to the\r\n foundation and to a very small number of charitable and philanthropic\r\n organizations which she has, for the most part, already definitively\r\n selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SPELLER TITLES\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE AGE OF TRIUMPH AND\r\n    FRUSTRATION: MODERN DIALOGUES      $4.95\r\n    By Ambassador Charles Yost\r\n\r\n  THE CRETAN DRAMA                     $7.50\r\n    The Memoirs of H.R.H.\r\n    Prince George of Greece\r\n\r\n  CHALLENGE OF THE STEPPES:\r\n    ROOTS OF THE COLD WAR              $6.00\r\n    By Joseph F.

Both were illegible, and therefore could not be preserved.\r\n\r\nIn this txt file, text in _italics_ is indicated with underscores.",
