While giving short histories of the\r\nlives of the collectors, and some description of their libraries, I have\r\nalso endeavoured to show what manner of men the owners of these\r\ncollections were. In doing this I have sought, where practicable, to let\r\nthe accounts be told as much as possible in the words of their\r\nbiographers, as their narratives are often not only full of interest,\r\nbut are also couched in delightfully quaint language. As it would not be\r\npossible in a volume of this size to furnish satisfactory notices of all\r\nthe Englishmen who have formed large libraries, I have selected some of\r\nthose who appear to possess special claims to notice, either on the\r\nground of their interesting personality, or the exceptional importance\r\nof their collections. I have not given any account of the collectors who\r\nlived prior to the reign of Henry VII., for until that time libraries\r\nconsisted almost entirely of manuscripts; and I have also excluded men\r\nwho, like Sir Thomas Bodley, collected books for the express purpose of\r\nforming, or adding to, public libraries.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Walter Stanley Graves, has in an appendix to this volume\r\ncompiled a list of the principal sales of libraries in this country from\r\nan early period to the present time, which will be found to supply\r\nuseful information about many of those collectors who are not otherwise\r\nmentioned in the book.\r\n\r\nMr. Locker-Lampson in the introduction to the catalogue of his library\r\nvery pertinently remarks: 'It is a good thing to read books, and it need\r\nnot be a bad thing to write them; but it is a pious thing to preserve\r\nthose that have been some time written.' To collectors scholars owe a\r\ndeep debt of gratitude, for innumerable are the precious manuscripts and\r\nrare printed books which they have rescued from destruction, and not a\r\nfew of them have enriched by their gifts and bequests the public\r\nlibraries of their country. Every lover of books must feel how greatly\r\nindebted he is to Archbishops Cranmer and Parker, the Earl of Arundel,\r\nLord Lumley, Sir Robert Cotton, and other early collectors, for saving\r\nso many of the priceless manuscripts from the libraries of the\r\nsuppressed monasteries and religious houses which, at the Reformation,\r\nintolerance, ignorance, and greed consigned to the hands of the tailor,\r\nthe goldbeater, and the grocer. A large number of the treasures once to\r\nbe found in these collections have been irrecoverably lost, but many a\r\nvolume, now the pride of some great library, bears witness to the pious\r\nand successful exertions of these eminent men.\r\n\r\nA love of book-collecting has always prevailed in this country, and\r\nsince the end of the seventeenth century it has become very widely\r\ndiffused. In the early days of the eighteenth century the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, the Earls of Oxford and Sunderland, and several other\r\ncollectors, employed themselves during the winter months in rambling\r\nthrough various quarters of the town in search of additions to their\r\nlibraries, and with some of these collectors the acquisition of books\r\nbecame a positive passion. In 1813 Dr. Dibdin thought that the\r\nthermometer of bibliomania had reached its highest point, and it would\r\ncertainly appear to have been very high indeed, judging from the prices\r\nobtained at the Roxburghe and other sales of the time. For some years\r\nthere was a period of depression, which perhaps was at the lowest\r\nbetween 1830 and 1850, but the desire to acquire rare books appears\r\nnever to have been greater than at the present day, and for the choicest\r\nexamples collectors are willing to give sums which dwarf into\r\ninsignificance the prices which excited the astonishment of our fathers.\r\nThese high prices may possibly be somewhat due to the spirited bidding\r\nof the great bookseller we have recently lost, and to the competition of\r\nour American cousins; but they are also distinct evidences that the\r\nbeautiful and interesting volumes which issued from the presses of the\r\nold printers have not lost their charm for the bibliophiles of our own\r\ntime. They have the advantage, too, of causing these treasures to be\r\nmore valued, and consequently better treated, for it has been well said\r\nthat nothing tends to the preservation of anything so much as making it\r\nbear a high price.\r\n\r\nA chronological arrangement of the collectors has been adopted for\r\nseveral reasons as the preferable one, but an alphabetical list of their\r\nnames will be found at the beginning of the volume. It ought also to be\r\nobserved that accounts of the different libraries rarely mention the\r\nnumber of books contained in them, but when they have been sold by\r\nauction I have found by a careful examination of the sale catalogues\r\nthat on an average each lot may be reckoned as consisting of about a\r\nvolume and a half.\r\n\r\n  'For out of the olde feldes, as men saythe,\r\n  Cometh al this newe come fro yere to yere,\r\n  And out of olde bokes, in good faythe,\r\n  Cometh al this newe science that men lere.'\r\n\r\n  CHAUCER.--_Parlement of Foules._\r\n\r\n  W.Y.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF COLLECTORS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n  Arundel, Henry Fitzalan, Earl of,                     30\r\n  Ashburnham, Bertram, Earl of,                        382\r\n  Askew, Dr. Anthony,                                  219\r\n  Bagford, John,                                       129\r\n  Banks, Sir Joseph, Bart.,                            270\r\n  Beauclerk, Hon.

In the Wardrobe\r\nAccounts of that Sovereign, preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the\r\nlibrary of the British Museum, mention is made of the conveyance, in the\r\nyear 1480, of the King's books from London to Eltham Palace. It is\r\nstated that some were put into 'the kings carr,' and others into 'divers\r\ncofyns of fyrre,' Several entries also refer to the 'coverying and\r\ngarnysshing of the books of oure saide Souverain Lorde the Kynge' by\r\nPiers Bauduyn, stationer. Among the books mentioned are the works of\r\nJosephus, Livy, and Froissart, 'a booke of _the holy Trinite_,' 'a\r\nbooke called _le Gouvernement of Kinges and Princes_,' 'a booke called\r\n_la Forteresse de Foy_,' and 'a booke called the _bible historial_.' The\r\nprice paid for 'binding, gilding, and dressing' the copy of the _Bible\r\nHistoriale_ and the works of Livy was twenty shillings each, and for\r\nseveral others sixteen shillings each. Other entries show that the\r\nbindings were of 'Cremysy velvet figured,' with 'Laces and Tassels of\r\nSilk,' with 'Blue Silk and Gold Botons,' and with 'Claspes with Roses\r\nand the Kings Armes uppon them.' 'LXX Bolions coper and gilt,' and 'CCC\r\nnayles gilt' were also used.\r\n\r\nThe first English king who formed a library of any size was Henry VII.,\r\nand many entries are found in his Privy Purse Expenses relating to the\r\npurchase and binding of his books. The great ornament of his collection\r\nwas the superb series of volumes on vellum bought of Antoine Verard, the\r\nParis publisher, which now forms one of the choicer treasures of the\r\nBritish Museum. Henry's principal library was kept in his palace at\r\nRichmond, where, with the exception of some volumes which seem to have\r\nbeen taken to Beddington by Henry VIII., it appears to have remained for\r\nmore than a century after his death, for Justus Zinzerling, a native of\r\nThuringia, and Doctor of Laws at Basle, states in his book of travels,\r\nentitled _Itinerarium Galliae, etc._, Lyons, 1616, that 'the most\r\ncurious thing to be seen at Richmond Palace is Henry VII.'s library.' It\r\nwas probably removed to Whitehall, for the only book in the library\r\nmentioned by Zinzerling, a _Genealogia Rerum Angliae ab Adamo_, appears\r\nin a catalogue of Charles II.'s MSS. at Whitehall, compiled in 1666.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. inherited the love of his father for books, and added\r\nconsiderably to his collection. Besides the library at Richmond, Henry\r\nhad a fine one at Westminster, a catalogue of which, compiled in 1542 or\r\n1543, is still preserved in the Record Office. He had also libraries at\r\nGreenwich, Windsor, Newhall in Essex, and Beddington in Surrey. Some of\r\nhis books were also kept at St. James's, for in the inventory of his\r\nfurniture at that palace, entries occur of a _Description of the hollie\r\nlande_; 'a boke covered with vellat, embroidered with the Kings arms,\r\ndeclaring the same, in a case of black leather, with his graces arms';\r\nand other volumes. Of these libraries the largest and most important\r\nappears to have been that at Westminster. It was fairly rich in the\r\nGreek and Latin classics, and in the writings of French and Italian\r\nauthors. The English historians were well represented, but the principal\r\nfeature of the collection was the works of the Fathers, which were very\r\nnumerous. The library also contained no less than sixty primers, many of\r\nthem being bound in 'vellat,' or in 'lether gorgiously gilted.' In the\r\nsucceeding reign this library was purged 'of all massebookes, legendes,\r\nand other superstitiouse bookes' by an Order in Council, which also\r\ndirected that 'the garnyture of the bookes being either golde or silver'\r\nshould be delivered to Sir Anthony Aucher, the Master of the Jewel\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThe library at Greenwich contained three hundred and forty-one printed\r\nand manuscript volumes, besides a number of manuscripts, kept in various\r\nparts of the palace. An inventory, taken after the King's death,\r\nmentions among other books 'a greate booke called an Herballe,' 'twoo\r\ngreat Bibles in Latten,' and 'a booke, wrytten on parchment, of the\r\nprocesse betweene King Henry th' eight and the Ladye Katheryne Dowager.'\r\nThe Windsor and Newhall libraries were smaller; the first comprising one\r\nhundred and nine, and the second sixty volumes. At Beddington were some\r\nremarkably choice books, including many beautiful editions printed for\r\nAntoine Verard, probably some of those purchased by Henry VII. Among\r\nthese was 'a greate booke of parchment, written and lymned with gold of\r\ngravers worke, _de confessione Amantis_.'\r\n\r\nEdward VI. and Mary during their short reigns added comparatively few\r\nbooks to the royal collection, nor are there many to be now found in it\r\nwhich were acquired by Elizabeth. It is difficult to say what became of\r\nthis Queen's books, of which she appears to have possessed a\r\nconsiderable number; for Paul Hentzner tells us in his _Itinerary_ that\r\nher library at Whitehall, when he visited it in 1598, was well stored\r\nwith books in various languages, 'all bound in velvet of different\r\ncolours, although chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some\r\nhaving pearls and precious stones set in their bindings.' Probably the\r\nrichness of the bindings had much to do with the disappearance of the\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nJames I. is undoubtedly entitled to a place in the list of royal\r\nbook-collectors, and the numerous fine volumes, many of them splendidly\r\nbound, with which he augmented the royal library, testify to his love of\r\nbooks. When but twelve years of age he possessed a collection of\r\nsomething like six hundred volumes, about four hundred of which are\r\nspecified in a manuscript list, principally in the handwriting of Peter\r\nYoung, who shared with George Buchanan the charge of James's education.\r\nThis list is preserved in the British Museum, and was edited in 1893 by\r\nMr. G.F. Warner, Assistant-Keeper of Manuscripts, for the Scottish\r\nHistory Society. After the death of the learned Isaac Casaubon, the\r\nKing, at the instigation of Patrick Young, his librarian, purchased his\r\nentire library of his widow for the sum of two hundred and fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nIf James I. is entitled to be regarded as a collector, his eldest son\r\nHenry has even a better claim to the title. This young prince, who\r\ncombined a great fondness for manly sports with a sincere love for\r\nliterature, purchased from the executors of his tutor, Lord Lumley, the\r\ngreater portion of the large and valuable collection which that nobleman\r\nhad partly formed himself, and partly inherited from his father-in-law,\r\nHenry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, the possessor of a fine library at\r\nNonsuch, comprising a number of manuscripts and many printed volumes\r\nwhich had belonged to Archbishop Cranmer. Henry's first care after the\r\nacquisition of the books was to have them catalogued, and in his Privy\r\nPurse Expenses for the year 1609 we find the following entry: 'To Mr.\r\nHolcock, for writing a Catalogue of the Library which his Highness hade\r\nof my Lord Lumley, L8, 13s. 0d.' He also unfortunately had the volumes\r\nrebound and stamped with his arms and badges, a step which must have\r\ndestroyed many interesting bindings. Henry only lived three years to\r\nenjoy his purchase, but during that time he made many additions to it.\r\nEdward Wright, the mathematician, who died in 1615, was his librarian,\r\nand received a salary of thirty pounds a year. As Henry died intestate\r\nhis library became the property of his father, and passed into the royal\r\ncollection which was given to the British Museum by George II.\r\n\r\nPrince Rupert also appears to have inherited to some extent the love\r\nof books possessed by his grandfather James I. and his uncle Prince\r\nHenry, for he formed a well-selected library of about twelve hundred\r\nvolumes, of which a catalogue is preserved among the Sloane manuscripts\r\nin the British Museum.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY, PRINCE OF WALES.]\r\n\r\nKing Charles I., although he bought some books, and had a number of\r\nvaluable volumes given to him by his mother, can hardly be classed with\r\nthe royal book-collectors. He had a greater inclination to paintings and\r\nmusic than to books, and it is said that he so excelled in the fine\r\narts, that he might, if it were necessary, 'have got a livelihood by\r\nthem.' One very precious addition to the royal library was, however,\r\nmade during his reign: the famous _Codex Alexandrinus_, which Cyril\r\nLucar, Patriarch of Constantinople, in 1624 placed in the hands of Sir\r\nThomas Roe, the English ambassador to the Porte, as a gift to King\r\nJames, but which did not reach England till four years later, when that\r\nsovereign was no longer alive. The royal library, which had narrowly\r\nescaped dispersion in the Civil War, was largely increased during the\r\nreign of Charles II., and at his death the works in it amounted to more\r\nthan ten thousand. A love of books can scarcely be attributed to\r\nCharles, and although he certainly caused some important additions to be\r\nmade to the collection--notably a number of valuable manuscripts which\r\nhad belonged successively to John and Charles Theyer--the greater part\r\nof the increase may be ascribed to the operation of the Copyright Act,\r\nwhich was passed in the fourteenth year of this reign, and enabled the\r\nroyal library to claim a copy of every work printed in the English\r\ndominions. From the death of Charles until the library was given to the\r\nnation by George II. in 1757 little interest was taken in it by the\r\nkings and queens who reigned in the interval.\r\n\r\nAlthough George III. was a man of somewhat imperfect education, he\r\nkeenly regretted the loss of the royal collection, and no sooner was he\r\nseated on the throne than he began to amass the magnificent library\r\nwhich has now joined its predecessor in the British Museum. In this\r\nlabour of love he was assisted by the sympathy and help of his Queen,\r\nwho, Dr. Croly tells us, was in the habit of paying visits, with a\r\nlady-in-waiting, to Holywell Street and Ludgate Hill, where second-hand\r\nbooks were offered for sale. The King commenced the formation of his\r\ncollection in 1762 by buying for about ten thousand pounds the choice\r\nlibrary of Mr. Joseph Smith, who for many years was the British consul\r\nat Venice, and 'for seven or eight years the shops and warehouses of\r\nEnglish booksellers were also sedulously examined, and large purchases\r\nwere made from them. In this labour Dr. Johnson often assisted,\r\nactively as well as by advice.'[2] It is said the King expended during\r\nhis long reign, on an average, about two thousand pounds a year in the\r\npurchase of books. In 1768 he despatched his illegitimate half-brother,\r\nMr. Barnard, afterwards Sir Frederic Augusta Barnard, whom he had\r\nappointed his librarian, on a bibliographical tour on the Continent,\r\nduring which so many valuable acquisitions were obtained for the\r\nlibrary, that it at once took its place amongst the most important\r\ncollections in the country, and after the death of the King, when the\r\nbooks it contained were counted by order of a select committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons, they were found to number 'about 65,250 exclusive of a\r\nvery numerous assortment of pamphlets, principally contained in 868\r\ncases, and requiring about 140 more cases to contain the whole.' These\r\ntracts, which number about nineteen thousand, have since been separately\r\nbound. The manuscripts belonging to the library amount to about four\r\nhundred and forty volumes, and there is also a magnificent collection of\r\nmaps and topographical prints and drawings. The library is very rich in\r\nbibliographical rarities as well as in general literature. The Gutenberg\r\nBible, the Bamberg Bible, the first and second Mentz Psalters (the\r\nfirst, a superb volume, is kept at Windsor Castle), and no less than\r\nthirty-nine Caxtons are among the most conspicuous of the many\r\ntreasures of this splendid collection. The Caxtons were principally\r\npurchased at the sales of the libraries of James West in 1773, John\r\nRatcliffe, the Bermondsey ship-chandler, who had acquired the remarkable\r\nnumber of forty-eight, in 1776, and of Richard Farmer in 1798. Edwards,\r\nin his _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, informs us that\r\n'Ratcliffe's forty-eight Caxtons produced at his sale two hundred and\r\nthirty-six pounds, and that the king bought twenty of them at an\r\naggregate cost of about eighty-five pounds. Amongst them were _Boethius\r\nde Consolatione Philosophiae_, the first editions of _Reynard the Foxe_\r\nand the _Golden Legende_, the _Curial_, and the _Speculum Vitae Christi_.\r\nThe _Boethius_ is a fine copy, and was obtained for four pounds six\r\nshillings.'\r\n\r\nGeorge III.'s library was first kept in the old Palace of Kew, which was\r\npulled down in 1802, and afterwards in a handsome and extensive suite of\r\nrooms at Buckingham House; the site which at one time had been proposed\r\nfor the British Museum. Scholars and students were at all times\r\nliberally permitted by the King to consult the books, and he also showed\r\nhis kindly consideration for them by instructing his librarian 'not to\r\nbid either against a literary man who wants books for study, or against\r\na known collector of small means.' A handsome catalogue of the library\r\nwas compiled by Sir F.A. Barnard, who had charge of the collection from\r\nits commencement to the time when it was acquired by the nation. He died\r\non the 27th of January 1830, aged eighty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe library in which George III. took so keen an interest was regarded\r\nby his successor as a costly burden, and there is little doubt he\r\nintended to dispose of it to the Emperor of Russia, who was very anxious\r\nto obtain it. The design of the King having become known to Lord\r\nFarnborough and Richard Heber, the collector, they communicated\r\nintelligence of it to Lord Liverpool and Lord Sidmouth, who were\r\nfortunately able to prevent the proposed sale of the books by offering\r\nthe King an equivalent for them, the amount of which has not transpired,\r\nout of a fund known as the Droits of the Admiralty. On the completion of\r\nthe bargain, George IV. addressed to Lord Liverpool a letter, dated\r\nJanuary 15th, 1823, in which occur the following words: 'The King, my\r\nlate revered and excellent father, having formed during a long series of\r\nyears a most valuable and extensive library, consisting of about 120,000\r\nvolumes, I have resolved to present this collection to the British\r\nNation.' This letter, printed in letters of gold, is preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum. In addition to the first edition of the Mentz Psalter;\r\nthe Aldine Virgil of 1505, the Second Shakespeare folio which once\r\nbelonged to Charles I., four Caxtons forming part of the collection,\r\nviz., _The Doctrinal of Sapience_, on parchment, _The Fables of AEsop_,\r\n_The Fayts of Arms_, and the _Recueil des Histoires de Troye_, with a\r\nfew other volumes, were retained at Windsor.\r\n\r\nOf the sons of George III., the Duke of Sussex alone appears to have\r\ninherited his father's love of collecting books, and he formed a\r\nmagnificent library in his apartments at Kensington Palace. The\r\ncollection consisted of more than fifty thousand volumes, twelve\r\nthousand of which were theological. It included a very considerable\r\nnumber of early Hebrew and other rare manuscripts, and about one\r\nthousand editions of the Bible. An elaborate catalogue of a portion of\r\nit, entitled _Bibliotheca Sussexiana_, was compiled by Dr. T.J.\r\nPettigrew, the Duke's librarian, in two volumes, the first of which was\r\nprinted in 1827, and the second in 1839.\r\n\r\nAfter the Duke's death his books were sold by auction by Evans of Pall\r\nMall. They were disposed of in six sales, the first of which took place\r\nin July 1844, and the last in August 1845; and they occupied altogether\r\nsixty-one days. The number of lots was fourteen thousand one hundred and\r\nseven, and the total amount realised nineteen thousand one hundred and\r\nforty-eight pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York possessed a good library, which was sold by Sotheby in\r\nMay 1827, but it consisted almost entirely of modern books, and the Duke\r\ncould hardly be considered a collector.\r\n\r\nOn his succession to the throne William IV., as he remarked, found\r\nhimself the only sovereign in Europe not possessed of a library, and\r\nspeedily took steps to acquire one. He did more than this, for in July\r\n1833 he caused a special codicil to his will to be drawn up which sets\r\nforth that 'Whereas His Majesty hath made considerable additions to the\r\nRoyal Libraries in His Majesty's several Palaces, and may hereafter make\r\nfurther additions thereto, Now His Majesty doth give and bequeath all\r\nsuch additions, whether the same have been or may be made by and at the\r\ncost of His Majesty's Privy Purse or otherwise unto and for the benefit\r\nof His Majesty's successors, in order that the said Royal Libraries may\r\nbe transmitted entire.'\r\n\r\nWhen on November 30th, 1834, the King signed this document, he made it\r\nyet more emphatic by the autograph note: 'Approved and confirmed by me\r\nthe King, and I further declare that all the books, drawings, and plans\r\ncollected in all the palaces shall for ever continue Heirlooms to the\r\nCrown and on no pretence whatever be alienated from the Crown.'\r\n\r\nThus explicitly protected from the fate which befell its two\r\npredecessors, this third Royal Library throve and prospered under Queen\r\nVictoria till it fills a handsome room at Windsor Castle. The few books\r\nreserved by George IV. give it importance as an antiquarian collection;\r\nbut its development has been rather on historical and topographical than\r\non antiquarian lines, though it possesses sufficient fine bindings to\r\nhave supplied materials for a handsome volume of facsimiles by Mr.\r\nGriggs, edited with introduction and descriptions by Mr. R. R. Holmes,\r\nM.V.O., the King's Librarian at Windsor.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sloane MSS. 555.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Edwards, _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, p.\r\n469.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN FISHER, BISHOP OF ROCHESTER, 1459?-1535\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, and\r\nwas the eldest son of Robert Fisher, a mercer of that town. The date of\r\nhis birth is uncertain, some of his biographers placing it as early as\r\n1459, and others as late as 1469. He was educated in the school attached\r\nto the collegiate church of his native place, and afterwards at Michael\r\nHouse, Cambridge (now incorporated into Trinity College), of which he\r\nbecame a Fellow in 1491, and Master in 1497. In 1501 he was elected\r\nVice-Chancellor, and in 1504 Chancellor of the University. The respect\r\nin which Margaret, Countess of Richmond, the mother of Henry VII., held\r\nhim, induced her to appoint him her chaplain and confessor, and it was\r\nprincipally through his exertions that the Countess's designs for\r\nfounding St. John's College, Cambridge, were carried out, Fisher himself\r\nsubsequently founding several fellowships, scholarships, and\r\nlectureships in connection with the college. He was appointed the first\r\n'Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity' in the University of Cambridge\r\nin 1503, and in 1504 was consecrated Bishop of Rochester. The firmness\r\nwith which he opposed the royal supremacy, and the divorce of Henry\r\nVIII., brought on him the displeasure of the King, and in 1534, having\r\ngiven too ready a credence to the 'revelations' of Elizabeth Barton,\r\n'the nun of Kent,' he was attainted of misprision of treason, and soon\r\nafterwards, on his refusal to acknowledge the King's supremacy and the\r\nvalidity of his marriage with Anne Boleyn, was committed with Sir Thomas\r\nMore to the Tower. During his imprisonment Pope Paul III. created him a\r\ncardinal, an act which greatly increased the irritation of the King\r\nagainst him, and on the 22nd of June 1535 Fisher was beheaded on Tower\r\nHill.\r\n\r\nBishop Fisher, who was the author of a considerable number of\r\ncontroversial tracts, was a man of great learning, and is said to have\r\npossessed the finest library in the country. In an account of his life\r\nand death first published in 1665, which was professedly written by\r\nThomas Baily, a royalist divine, but is said to have been really the\r\nwork of Dr. Richard Hall of Christ's College, Cambridge, who died in\r\n1604, a relation is given of the seizure of his goods and books after\r\nhis attainder. 'In the meantime lest any conveyance might be made of his\r\ngoods remaining at Rochester, or elsewhere in Kent, the King sent one\r\nSir Richard Moryson, of his Privy Chamber, and one Gostwick, together\r\nwith divers other Commissioners, down into that Countrey, to make\r\nseisure of all his moveable goods that they could finde there, who being\r\ncome unto Rochester, according to their Commission, entred his house;\r\nand the first thing they did was, they turned out all his Servants; then\r\nthey fell to rifling his goods, whereof the chief part of them were\r\ntaken for the Kings use, the rest they took for themselves; then they\r\ncame into his Library, which they found so replenished, and with such\r\nkind of Books, as it was thought the like was not to be found againe in\r\nthe possession of any one private man in Christendom; with which they\r\ntrussed up and filled 32 great vats, or pipes, besides those that were\r\nimbezel'd away, spoyl'd and scatter'd; and whereas many yeares before he\r\nhad made a deed of gift of all these books, and other his household\r\nstuffe to the Colledge of St John in Cambridge, ... two frauds were\r\ncommitted in this trespasse; the Colledge were bereaved of their gift,\r\nand the Bishop of his purpose.' An account of his library and its\r\nconfiscation is also to be found in a manuscript treatise concerning his\r\nlife and death, preserved among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum.\r\n'He had ye notablest Library of Books in all England, two long\r\ngalleries full, the Books were sorted in stalls & a Register of ye\r\nnames of every Book at ye end of every stall. All these his Books, &\r\nall his Hangings, plate, & vessels for Hawl, Chamber, Buttry, & Kitchin,\r\nhe gave long before his death to St Joh: College, by a Deed of gift, &\r\nput them in possession thereof; & then by indenture did borrow all ye\r\nsd: books & stuff, to have ye use of ym during his life, but at his\r\napprehension, the Lord Crumwell caused all to be confiscated, which he\r\ngave to Moryson, Plankney of Chester, and other that were about him, &\r\nso ye College was defrauded of all this gift.'\r\n\r\nErasmus represents Fisher as a man of the greatest integrity, of deep\r\nlearning, incredible sweetness of temper, and grandeur of soul; and Sir\r\nThomas More declared that there was 'in this realm no one man, in\r\nwisdom, learning, and long approved vertue together, mete to be matched\r\nand compared with him.'\r\n\r\nAn excellent portrait of Fisher is preserved among the Holbein drawings\r\nat Windsor Castle, and others are to be found in several of the Colleges\r\nof the University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CRANMER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, 1489-1556\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, the events of whose life are\r\nso well known that it is not necessary to give an account of them here,\r\npossessed a very fine library, both of manuscripts and printed books.\r\nMany of the volumes it contained are still in existence, and fortunately\r\nthey can be identified without difficulty, as almost all of them bear\r\nthe Archbishop's name written, it is believed, by one of his\r\nsecretaries. As might be expected, the books are principally of a\r\ntheological nature, although copies of the Greek and Latin Classics, and\r\nof works treating of historical, scientific, legal, medical, and\r\nmiscellaneous subjects are fairly numerous. Strype tells us 'that the\r\nlibrary was the storehouse of ecclesiastical writers of all ages: and\r\nwhich was open for the use of learned men. Here old Latimer spent many\r\nan hour; and found some books so remarkable, that once he thought fit to\r\nmention one in a sermon before the King.' Strype adds that Cranmer both\r\nannotated the books in his library, and also made extracts from them,\r\nand the notes which are found in many of those which have been\r\npreserved to our time confirm his statement.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the library after the fall of its owner can only be\r\nconjectured.\r\n\r\nSoon after the accession of Mary to the throne Cranmer was put on his\r\ntrial for high treason, and sentence of death was passed upon him; and\r\nalthough at that time his life was spared, he was included in the Act of\r\nAttainder passed in Parliament against the Earl of Northumberland,\r\ndeprived of his archbishopric, and committed to the Tower. He had to\r\nproduce an inventory of his goods; and a list of all the property found\r\nin the Archbishop's palaces is still preserved in the Record Office,\r\nbut, with the exception that it is stated that a 'bible with other\r\nbookes of service' were 'conveyed and stolen awaie' from the chapel, no\r\nmention is made of the books. They probably shared the fate of the goods\r\nof Robert Holgate, Archbishop of York, who was deprived of his see in\r\n1554, and imprisoned in the Tower, and while confined there had his\r\nhouses at Battersea and Cawood rifled of all their valuables.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that many of Cranmer's books were acquired by Lord Lumley,\r\nthen a young nobleman in high favour at Court; and others by Lord\r\nLumley's father-in-law, Henry Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, the Lord\r\nSteward, who at that time was forming a library at Nonsuch, which he had\r\nrecently purchased of the Queen; as a number of the volumes which were\r\nin their libraries have the Archbishop's name inscribed in them.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger portion of Cranmer's books which have survived to the\r\npresent time are preserved in the British Museum, whither they came in\r\n1757 as part of the old Royal Library, Henry Prince of Wales having\r\npurchased the Lumley and Arundel collections in 1609. But some are also\r\npossessed by the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Library, and\r\nthe Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth, while others are to be found on\r\nthe shelves of various cathedral and collegiate libraries, and a few are\r\nin private hands. Those belonging to the two University Libraries were\r\nprobably gifts of Lord Lumley, who presented eighty-four volumes to the\r\nCambridge University Library in 1598, and forty to the Bodleian in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nCranmer was the author of several theological books, and he also wrote\r\nthe prologue to the second edition of the 'Great Bible,' printed in\r\n1540. His works were collected and arranged by H. Jenkyns, and published\r\nin four volumes at Oxford in 1833. There is a portrait of the\r\nArchbishop, at the age of fifty-seven, by G. Fliccius in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery, and others are at Cambridge and Lambeth. Cranmer was\r\nborn at Aslacton Manor, in Nottinghamshire, on the 21st of July 1489,\r\nand burned at the stake at Oxford on the 21st of March 1556.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHBISHOP PARKER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTHEW PARKER, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, 1504-1575\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Parker, the second Protestant Archbishop of Canterbury, was born\r\nat Norwich on the 6th of August 1504. He was the son of William Parker,\r\na calenderer of stuffs, who, Strype says, 'lived in very good reputation\r\nand plenty, and was a gentleman, bearing for his coat of arms on a field\r\ngules, three keys erected. To which shield, in honour of the Archbishop,\r\na chevron was added afterwards, charged with three resplendent\r\nestoilles.' Parker was first privately educated, and afterwards\r\nproceeded to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, of which college he was\r\nelected a Fellow in 1527. In the same year he took holy orders, and in\r\n1535 was appointed Chaplain to Queen Anne Boleyn, who shortly afterwards\r\nconferred on him the Deanery of the College of St. John the Baptist at\r\nStoke, near Clare in Suffolk. In 1538 he was created a Doctor of\r\nDivinity, and made one of the King's chaplains; and in 1544 he was\r\nelected Master of Corpus Christi College. He was chosen to the office of\r\nVice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1545, and again in\r\n1549. In 1552 he was appointed to the Deanery of Lincoln, of which he\r\nwas deprived in 1554. During the reign of Mary, Parker lived quietly\r\npursuing his studies, as he himself tells us, 'Postea privatus vixi, ita\r\ncoram Deo laetus in conscientia mea; adeoque nee pudefactus, nec\r\ndejectus, ut dulcissimum otium literarium, ad quod Dei bona providentia\r\nme revocavit, multo majores et solidiores voluptates mihi pepererit,\r\nquam negotiosum illud et periculosum vivendi genus unquam placuit.' On\r\nthe accession of Elizabeth he was summoned from his retirement and made\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. His consecration took place on the 17th of\r\nDecember 1559. He died on the 17th of May 1575, and was buried in his\r\nprivate chapel at Lambeth, in a tomb which he had himself prepared. His\r\nremains, however, were disinterred in 1648 by Colonel Scot, the\r\nregicide, and buried under a dunghill, but after the Restoration they\r\nwere replaced in the chapel.\r\n\r\nParker married in 1547 Margaret, daughter of Robert Harlestone of\r\nMatsal, in the county of Norfolk, by whom he had four sons, of whom two\r\ndied in infancy, and a daughter. John, the eldest son, was knighted in\r\n1603, and died in 1618.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Parker was not only a great churchman, a distinguished\r\nscholar, and a warm promoter of learning, but he was also an ardent\r\ncollector of books, and formed a very fine and valuable library,\r\ncomposed to a great extent of rare and choice manuscripts which had\r\nonce belonged to the suppressed monasteries and religious houses. He\r\nalso appears to have purchased Bale's fine collection of manuscripts.\r\n\r\nSome of his books he presented to the Cambridge University Library\r\nduring his lifetime, and in his will he made bequests of other volumes\r\nfrom his collection to that library. He also gave books to the libraries\r\nof the colleges of Caius and Trinity Hall, but the great bulk of his\r\nmanuscripts and printed books he left to his own college of Corpus\r\nChristi.[3] An original list of these volumes is preserved in the\r\ncollege, with a note by John Parker, the Archbishop's son, stating that\r\nthe missing volumes 'weare not found by me in my father's Librarie, but\r\neither lent or embezeled, whereby I could not deliver them to the\r\ncollege.' Some singular conditions were attached to this bequest by the\r\nArchbishop. 'Every year on the 6th of August, the collection is to be\r\nvisited by the masters or _locum tenentes_ of Trinity Hall and Caius,\r\nwith two scholars on Archbishop Parker's foundation, and if, on\r\nexamination of the library, twenty-five books are missing, or cannot be\r\nfound within six months, the whole collection devolves to Caius. In that\r\ncase the masters or _locum tenentes_ of Trinity Hall and Benet, with two\r\nscholars on the same foundation, are the visitors: and if Caius College\r\nbe guilty of the like neglect, the books to be delivered up to Trinity\r\nHall: then the masters or _locum tenentes_ of Caius and Benet, with two\r\nsuch scholars, become the inspectors; and in case of default on part of\r\nTrinity Hall, the whole collection reverts back to its former order. On\r\nthe examination day, the visitors dine in the College Hall, and receive\r\nthree shillings and four pence, and the scholars one shilling each.'[4]\r\nIt is also probable that he was a benefactor to the library at Lambeth,\r\nfor some of the manuscripts preserved there contain notes in his\r\nhandwriting. The books which he did not specially bequeath he left to\r\nhis son John, afterwards Sir John Parker.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the books which Parker gave to Corpus Christi College he\r\nfounded several scholarships in connection with it, and bestowed upon it\r\nlarge sums of money and presents of plate. He also gave various pieces\r\nof plate to Gonville and Caius College and Trinity Hall.\r\n\r\nParker's love for books, and the pains he took to rescue the precious\r\nvolumes which, after the dissolution of the abbeys and religious houses,\r\nwere being destroyed or sold for common purposes, is so well told by\r\nStrype that his account is worth giving at length: 'His learning, though\r\nit were universal, yet it ran chiefly upon antiquity. Insomuch that he\r\nwas one of the greatest antiquarians of the age. And the world is for\r\never beholden to him for two things; viz., for retrieving many ancient\r\nauthors, Saxon and British, as well as Norman, and for restoring and\r\nenlightening a great deal of the ancient history of this noble island.\r\nHe lived in, or soon after, those times, wherein opportunities were\r\ngiven for searches after these antiquities. For when the abbeys and\r\nreligious houses were dissolved, and the books that were contained in\r\nthe libraries thereunto belonging underwent the same fate, being\r\nmiserably embezzled, and sold away to tradesmen for little or nothing,\r\nfor their ordinary shop uses; then did our Parker, and some few more\r\nlovers of ancient learning, procure, both by their money and their\r\nfriends, what books soever they could: and having got them into their\r\npossession, esteemed many of them as their greatest treasures, which\r\nother ignorant spoilers esteemed but as trash, and to be burnt, or sold\r\nat easy rates, or converted to any ordinary uses.\r\n\r\n'He was therefore a mighty collector of books, to preserve, as much as\r\ncould be, the ancient monuments of the learned men of our nation from\r\nperishing. And for that purpose he did employ divers men proper for such\r\nan end, to search all England over, and Wales, (and perhaps Scotland and\r\nIreland too), for books of all sorts, some modern as well as ancient;\r\nand to buy them up for his use; giving them commission and authority\r\nunder his own hand for doing the same. One of these, named Batman,[5] in\r\nthe space of no more than four years, procured for our Archbishop to the\r\nnumber of 6700 books. It seems to be almost incredible, then, what\r\ninfinite volumes all the rest of his agents in many more years must have\r\nretrieved for him.\r\n\r\n'It was in those times that many of our choicest MSS. were conveyed out\r\nof the land beyond sea. Of this our Archbishop complained often; taking\r\nit heavily, as he wrote in one of his letters to Secretary Cecyl, \"that\r\nthe nation was deprived of such choice monuments, so much as he saw they\r\nwere in those days, partly by being spent in shops, and used as waste\r\npaper, or conveyed over beyond sea, by some who considered more their\r\nown private gain than the honour of their country.\" This was the reason\r\nhe took so much pleasure in the said Secretary's library; \"that such\r\nMSS. might be preserved within the realm, and not sent over by covetous\r\nstationers, or spoiled in the apothecaries' shops.\" ... For the\r\nretrieving of these ancient treatises and MSS. as much as might be, the\r\nArchbishop had such abroad, as he appointed to lay out for them\r\nwheresoever they were to be met with, as was shewn before.\r\n\r\n'But he procured not a few himself from such in his own time as were\r\nstudious in antiquity: as, namely, several Saxon books from Robert\r\nTalbot,[6] a great collector of such ancient writings in King Henry the\r\nEighth's time, and an acquaintance of Leland, Bale, etc. Some of which\r\nwritings the said Talbot had from Dr. Owen,[7] the said King Henry's\r\nphysician; and some our archbishop likewise had from him; as appears in\r\none of the Cotton volumes:[8] which is made up of a collection of\r\nvarious charters, etc., written out by Joh. Joscelyn.[9] Where at some\r\nof these MSS. collected, the said Joscelyn adds these notes, _The copy\r\nof this Dr. Talbot had of Dr. Owen. The Archbishop of Canterbury had\r\nthis charter from Dr. Owen, etc_. There be other collections of this\r\nnature now remaining in Benet College, sometime belonging to this\r\nTalbot, which we may presume the Archbishop, partly by his own interest,\r\nand partly by the interest of Bale, Caius, and others, obtained;\r\nparticularly his annotations upon that part of Antoninus's _Itinerarium_\r\nwhich belongs to Britain. And another _De Chartis quibusdam regum\r\nBritannorum_. These are mentioned by Anthony a Wood.\r\n\r\n'And he kept such in his family as could imitate any of the old\r\ncharacters admirably well. One of these was Lyly, an excellent writer,\r\nand that could counterfeit any antique writing. Him the Archbishop\r\ncustomarily used to make old books complete, that wanted some pages;\r\nthat the character might seem to be the same throughout. So that he\r\nacquired at length an admirable collection of ancient MSS. and very many\r\ntoo: as we may conjecture from his diligence for so many years as he\r\nlived, in buying and procuring such monuments. The remainders of his\r\nhighly valuable collections are now preserved in several libraries of\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, but chiefly in that of Benet\r\nCollege, Cambridge.'\r\n\r\nArchbishop Parker was one of the founders of the Society of Antiquaries\r\nin 1572. He took a special interest in the early English Chronicles, and\r\nendeavoured to revive the study of the Saxon language. Among other works\r\nhe caused to be printed _Flores Historiarum_, attributed to Matthew of\r\nWestminster, Matthew Paris's _Historia Major_, and the Latin text of\r\nAsser's _Alfredi Regis Res Gestae_ in Saxon characters, cut by John Day,\r\nthe printer. He also, says Strype, 'laboured to forward the composing\r\nand publishing of a Saxon Dictionary.' His great work, _De Antiquitate\r\nBritannicae Ecclesiae et Privilegiis Ecclesiae Cantuariensis, cum\r\nArchiepiscopis eiusdem 70_, which, if not written by him, was produced\r\nunder his immediate supervision, was printed by John Day in Lambeth\r\nPalace in 1572. A very limited number of copies of this work, the first\r\nbook privately printed in England, were struck off; not more than\r\ntwenty-five are known to exist, and no two are found quite alike. The\r\npreparation of the Bishops' Bible, which was completed in 1568, was\r\nperformed under his auspices. A presentation copy to Queen Elizabeth\r\nfrom the Archbishop of the _Flores Historiarum_, very handsomely bound,\r\nwith the royal arms on the covers; and a copy of the work _De\r\nAntiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae, etc._, in a fine embroidered binding,\r\nwhich is also believed to have been presented to the Queen by the\r\nArchbishop, are preserved in the British Museum. These books were\r\nprobably bound in Lambeth Palace, for in a letter to Lord Burghley,\r\ndated the 9th of May 1573, the Archbishop writes, with reference to the\r\nlast-named work, 'I have within my house on wagis, drawers and cutters,\r\npaynters, lymners, wryters, and boke-bynders'; and he adds that he has\r\nsent Lord Burghley a copy of it 'bound by my man.'\r\n\r\nA list of Parker's writings, and his editions of authors will be found\r\nin Coopers' _Athenae Cantabrigienses_. There are portraits of him in\r\nLambeth Palace, the Guildhall at Norwich, Corpus Christi College, and in\r\nthe Master's Lodge, Trinity College, Cambridge. There is also a rare\r\nportrait of him, engraved in 1573, by Remigius Hogenberg, who appears to\r\nhave been in the service of the Archbishop.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: An interesting account of the sources of the manuscripts,\r\nby Montague Rhodes James, Litt.

On\r\nthe 24th of April in the same year he was made a K.G., and in the\r\nfollowing July he received the appointment of 'Marshal of the Field' in\r\nthe army which invaded France. He greatly distinguished himself at the\r\nsiege of Boulogne, and on his return home he was made Lord Chamberlain,\r\nwhich office he held until the fourth year of King Edward VI.'s reign,\r\nwhen, on a false and ridiculous charge of abusing the privileges of his\r\npost to enrich himself and his friends, he was deprived of it, and fined\r\ntwelve thousand pounds, eight thousand pounds of which was afterwards\r\nremitted.[12]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Edward, Arundel took a prominent part in the proceedings\r\nwhich placed Mary on the throne, and as a reward for his exertions he\r\nwas made Lord Steward of the Household, and was also given a seat on the\r\nCouncil Board. Queen Elizabeth, on her accession to the crown, continued\r\nhim in all the appointments which he had held in the preceding reign,\r\nand on several occasions visited him at Nonsuch, his residence at Cheam\r\nin Surrey. These marks of kindness led him, it is said, to aspire to a\r\nunion with his royal mistress; but being disappointed in gaining her\r\nhand, and 'being miscontented with sundry things,' in 1564 he resigned\r\nhis post of Lord Steward 'with sundry Speeches of Offence,'[13] which so\r\ndispleased Elizabeth that she ordered him to confine himself to his\r\nhouse. He afterwards partially regained the favour of the Queen, but\r\nhaving endeavoured to promote the marriage of his widowed son-in-law,\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, with Mary Queen of Scots, he was once more placed\r\nunder arrest, and although after a time he obtained his release, it was\r\nfollowed by further imprisonment, and he did not finally regain his\r\nliberty until some months after the execution of Norfolk on the 2nd of\r\nJune 1572.\r\n\r\nArundel passed the remainder of his life in retirement, affectionately\r\ntended until her death in 1577 by 'his nursse and deare beloved childe'\r\nLady Lumley. He died on the 24th of February 1580 at Arundel House in\r\nthe Strand, and was buried in the Collegiate Chapel at Arundel, where a\r\nmonument, with an inscription by his son-in-law, Lord Lumley, was\r\nerected to his memory.\r\n\r\nArundel was twice married. By his first wife, Katherine, second daughter\r\nof Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dorset, he had one son, Henry, Lord\r\nMaltravers, who died in 1556, and two daughters: Jane, who married Lord\r\nLumley, and Mary, who became the wife of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk,\r\nbeheaded in 1572. His second wife, Mary, who died in 1557, was a\r\ndaughter of Sir John Arundell of Lanherne, Cornwall, and widow of Robert\r\nRatcliffe, first Earl of Sussex. By her he had no issue.\r\n\r\nWith the assistance of Humphrey Llwyd, the physician and antiquary, who\r\nmarried Barbara, sister of Lord Lumley, Lord Arundel formed at his\r\nresidence of Nonsuch a fine collection of books, many of which had once\r\nbeen the property of Archbishop Cranmer. An account of this mansion is\r\ngiven in the manuscript Life of Lord Arundel, to which we have already\r\nalluded, and it also contains a reference to his library. 'This Earle\r\nmoreover continewed allwayes of a greate and noble mynde. Amonge the\r\nnumber of whose doings, that past in his tyme, this one is not the\r\nleast, to showe his magnificence, that perceivinge a sumptuous house\r\ncalled Nonsuche to have bene begon, but not finished, by his first\r\nmaister Kinge Henry the eighte, and thearfore in Quene Maryes tyme,\r\nthoughte mete rather to have bene pulled downe and solde by peacemeale\r\nthen to be perfited at her charges, he, for the love and honour he bare\r\nto his olde maister, desired to buye the same house, by greace, of the\r\nQuene, for wch he gave faire lands unto her Highnes; and having the\r\nsame, did not leave till he had fullye finished it in buildings,\r\nreparations, paviments and gardens, in as ample and perfit sorte as by\r\nthe first intente and meaninge of the saide Kinge his old maister, the\r\nsame should have bene performed, and so it is nowe evident to be\r\nbeholden of all strangers, and others, for the honour of this Realme as\r\na pearle thereof. The same he haith lefte to his posterity, garnished\r\nand replenished with riche furnitures; amonge the wch his Lybrarye is\r\nrighte worthye of remembrance.'\r\n\r\nLord Arundel left Nonsuch, with its library and furniture, together with\r\nthe greater part of his estates, to his son-in-law, Lord Lumley.\r\n\r\nThere are portraits of the Earl of Arundel by Holbein and Sir Anthony\r\nMore. That by Holbein, which is in the collection of the Marquis of\r\nBath, is engraved in Lodge's _Portraits of Illustrious Personages_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: MS.

He was the son of John Smith of Saffron Walden\r\nand Agnes Charnock, a member of an old Lancashire family. When eleven\r\nyears old he was sent to Queens' College, Cambridge, as he himself\r\ninforms us in his _Autobiographical Notes_, now preserved in the British\r\nMuseum,[14] which he wrote for the purpose of having his nativity cast:\r\n'1525. Sub fine II [=a]ni circa fest[=u] Mic[=h]is Cantabrigiam s[=u]\r\nmissus ad bonas I[=r]as.' Here he so greatly distinguished himself that\r\nKing Henry VIII. chose him and John Cheke, afterwards tutor to Prince\r\nEdward, to be his scholars, and allotted them salaries for the\r\nencouragement of their studies. Cheke makes mention of this honour in an\r\nepistle to the King prefixed to his edition of Two Homilies of St. John\r\nChrysostom, published at London in 1543: 'Cooptasti me et Thomam Smithum\r\nsocium atque aequalem meum, in scholasticos tuos.' Smith specially\r\napplied himself to the study of the Greek classics, and also to the\r\nreformation of the faulty pronunciation of the Greek language which then\r\nprevailed; and in a short time, so Strype, in his _Life of Sir T.\r\nSmith_, tells us, his more correct way 'prevailed all the University\r\nover.' He also endeavoured to introduce a new English alphabet of\r\ntwenty-nine letters, and to amend the spelling of the time, 'some of the\r\nsyllables,' he considered, 'being stuffed with needless letters.' As\r\nearly as 1531 he had become a Fellow of his college, and in 1534 he was\r\nchosen University Orator. In 1540 Smith paid a visit to the Continent,\r\nand proceeded to Padua, where he took the degree of D.C.L. On his return\r\nto England in 1542 he was made LL.D. at Cambridge, and at the beginning\r\nof 1544 was appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law at the University.\r\nIn the succeeding year he served as Vice-Chancellor, and also became\r\nChancellor to Goodrich, Bishop of Ely, by whom in 1546 he was collated\r\nto the rectory of Leverington, Cambridgeshire, and also ordained priest,\r\na fact unknown to Strype. About the same time he received a prebend from\r\nthe Dean of Lincoln, and soon after he became Provost of Eton and Dean\r\nof Carlisle. Towards the end of February 1547, Smith was summoned to\r\ncourt, and 'mutata clericali veste, modoque, ac vivendi forma,'[15] he\r\nwas made Clerk of the Privy Council, and Master of the Court of Requests\r\nof the Duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector. On the 14th of April 1548\r\nhe was sworn one of the King's Secretaries, and knighted in the\r\nbeginning of the following year. Shortly after his appointment Smith was\r\nsent as ambassador to the Emperor Charles V., and in 1551 he took part\r\nin the embassy to France to arrange a match for the King with the French\r\nsovereign's eldest daughter. On the accession of Mary he lost all his\r\noffices and preferments, but he managed to pass through this dangerous\r\nreign in safety; and Strype says of him, 'that when many were most\r\ncruelly burnt for the profession of the religion which he held, he\r\nescaped, and was saved even in the midst of the fire, which he probably\r\nmight have an eye to in changing the crest of his coat-of-arms, which\r\nnow was a salamander living in the midst of a flame; whereas before it\r\nwas an eagle holding a writing-pen flaming in his dexter claw.' When\r\nElizabeth came to the throne, Smith returned to court, and was engaged\r\nin several embassies to France. In 1572 the Queen conferred on him the\r\nChancellorship of the Order of the Garter; and shortly afterwards, on\r\nLord Burghley's preferment to the office of Lord Treasurer, vacant by\r\nthe death of the Marquis of Winchester, made him Secretary of State, a\r\npost which, four-and-twenty years before, he held under Edward VI. Smith\r\ndied at his residence called Mounthaut, or Hill-hall, in Essex on the\r\n12th of August 1577, and was buried in the parish church of Theydon\r\nMount, where a monument was erected to his memory. He was twice\r\nmarried, but had no children by either of his wives.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Smith possessed a fine library of about a thousand volumes.\r\nHe bequeathed all his Latin and Greek books, as well as his great globe,\r\nof his own making, to Queens' College, Cambridge, or, if that college\r\ndid not care to have them, to Peterhouse. Some of his Italian and French\r\nbooks he gave to the Queen's Library, and many volumes were also left to\r\nfriends. Strype gives a list of the contents of the library at Hill-hall\r\nin 1566.\r\n\r\nSmith was the author of several works, the principal one being _De\r\nRepublica Anglorum; the Maner of Gouvernement or Policie of the Realm of\r\nEngland_, London, 1583, 4to. Between 1583 and 1640 this work passed\r\nthrough ten editions, and several Latin and other translations of it\r\nhave been published.\r\n\r\nA portrait of him by Holbein is at Theydon Mount, and another is\r\npreserved at Queens' College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Sloane MSS. 325, f. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Autobiographical Notes_ by Sir T. Smith.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM CECIL, LORD BURGHLEY, 1520-1598\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Cecil, Lord Burghley, a relation of whose life would be the\r\nhistory of England during the reign of Elizabeth, was born in 1520 and\r\ndied in 1598. This great statesman, who at the age of sixteen delivered\r\na lecture on the logic of the Schools, and at nineteen one on the Greek\r\nlanguage, found time amid the cares and anxieties attendant on his high\r\nposition to form a library, which Strype tells us was a very choice one.\r\nThe same authority also mentions that he gave many books to the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, 'both Latin and Greek, concerning the canon and\r\ncivil law and physic.' In 1687 a considerable portion of his printed\r\nbooks and manuscripts was sold by auction. The title-page of the sale\r\ncatalogue reads 'Bibliotheca Illustriss: sive Catalogus Variorum\r\nLibrorum in quavis Lingua et Facultate Insignium ornatissimae Bibliothecae\r\nViri Cujusdam Praenobilis ac Honoratissimi olim defuncti, Libris\r\nrarissimis tam Typis excusis quam Manuscriptis refertissimae: Quorum\r\nAuctio habebitur Londini, ad Insigne Ursi in Vico dicto Ave-Mary-Lane\r\nprope Templum D. Pauli, Novemb. 21, 1687. Per T. Bentley and B. Walford,\r\nBibliopolas. Lond.'; and in the Preface we read:--'If the catalogue,\r\nhere presented, were only of Common Books, and such as were easie to be\r\nhad, it would not have been very necessary to have Prefac'd any thing to\r\nthe Reader: But since it appears in the World with two Circumstances,\r\nwhich no Auction in England (perhaps) ever had before; nor is it\r\nprobable that the like should frequently happen again, it would seem an\r\nOversight, if we should neglect to advertise the Reader of them. The\r\nfirst is, That it comprises the main part of the Library of that Famous\r\nSecretary William Cecil, Lord Burleigh: which consider'd, must put it\r\nout of doubt, that these Books are excellent in their several kinds and\r\nwell-chosen. The second is, That it contains a greater number of Rare\r\nManuscripts than ever yet were offer'd together in this way, many of\r\nwhich are rendred the more valuable by being remark'd upon by the hand\r\nof the said great Man. This Auction will begin on Monday the 21st day of\r\nNovember next 1687, at the sign of the Bear in Ave-Mary-Lane, near the\r\nWest-end of St. Paul's Church, continuing day by day the first five days\r\nof every Week, till all the Books are sold, from the Hours of Nine in\r\nthe Morning till Twelve, and from Two till Six in the Evening.' There\r\nwere three thousand eight hundred and forty-four lots of printed books,\r\nand four hundred and thirteen manuscripts in two hundred and forty-three\r\nlots in the sale. A copy of the catalogue, marked with the prices, is\r\npreserved in the British Museum. The printed books in the sale do not\r\nappear to have been exceptionally choice or rare, but there were some\r\nvaluable manuscripts. A few of the most notable, together with the\r\nprices they fetched, are given in the following list:--\r\n\r\n_Biblia Sacra Antiquissima_, folio magno, vellum--six pounds, twelve\r\nshillings; _Polychronicon vetus MS. per Radulphum Hygden, nunquam Latine\r\nimpressum_, vellum--eleven pounds; _Wicklif's Book of Postils or Sermons\r\nin Old English_--seven pounds, two shillings and six pence; _Other\r\nDiscourses by him_--ten pounds, two shillings and six pence; _Wilhelmus\r\nMalmesburiensis de gestis Regum Angliae_, vellum--seven pounds, three\r\nshillings; _L'Histoire du Roy Arthur, avec des Figures d'orees_, folio\r\ngrand on vellum--three pounds, two shillings; _Le Chronique de Jean\r\nFroissart des guerres de France et D'Angleterre_, folio grand, _avec des\r\nbelles Figures_, vellum--three pounds, nine shillings; _Norden .\r\nSpeculum Britanniae_--four pounds, seven shillings. It is not known to\r\nwhom these books belonged at the period of the sale, but it appears\r\nprobable they were the property of James Cecil, fourth Earl of Salisbury\r\n(a descendant of Lord Burghley's younger son), who succeeded to the\r\ntitle in 1683, and died in 1694. He was mixed up in the troubles of the\r\ntime, and was, says Macaulay, 'foolish to a proverb,' and the 'prey of\r\ngamesters.' John Cecil, Earl of Exeter, from 1678 to 1700, who was\r\ndescended from Lord Burghley's elder son, was himself a book collector,\r\nand therefore not likely to part with the library of his illustrious\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nThe bindings of Lord Burghley's books are generally stamped with his\r\narms, which are sometimes encircled by the order of the Garter, but a\r\nlittle volume preserved in the library of the British Museum simply\r\nbears his name and that of his second wife, his affectionate companion\r\nfor forty-three years. Lord Burghley left an immense mass of papers,\r\nwhich are now preserved at Hatfield House, the Record Office, the\r\nBritish Museum, etc. Those in the British Museum, which consist of one\r\nhundred and twenty-one folio volumes of state papers and the\r\nmiscellaneous correspondence of Lord Burghley, together with his private\r\nnote-book and journals, passed from Sir Michael Hickes, one of the\r\nstatesman's secretaries, to a descendant, Sir William Hickes, by whom\r\nthey were sold to Chiswell, the bookseller, and by him to Strype, the\r\nhistorian. On Strype's death they came into the hands of James West, and\r\nfrom his executors they were acquired by William Petty, first Marquis of\r\nLansdowne, whose manuscripts were purchased by the Trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum in 1807.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD BURGHLEY'S BOOK-STAMP.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WOTTON, 1521-1587\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Wotton was born in 1521 at Bocton or Boughton Place, in the\r\nparish of Boughton Malherbe, in the county of Kent, and succeeded his\r\nfather, Sir Edward Wotton, in that estate in 1550. He was appointed\r\nsheriff of the county of Kent in the last year of Queen Mary, and in\r\nJuly 1573 he entertained Elizabeth and her court at his residence,\r\nBocton Place, when she offered him knighthood, which he declined. Wotton\r\nwas twice married. By his first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John\r\nRudstone, he had three sons: Edward, knighted by Elizabeth, and\r\nafterwards raised to the peerage as Baron Wotton by James I.; and James\r\nand John, who were also made knights by Elizabeth. His second wife was\r\nEleanora, daughter of Sir William Finch of Eastwell in Kent, and widow\r\nof Robert Morton, Esq., of the same county, by whom he had a son, Henry,\r\nthe poet and statesman, who was knighted by James I. He died in London\r\non the 11th of January 1587, and was buried in the parish church of\r\nBoughton Malherbe, where a monument was erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMS OF THOMAS WOTTON.]\r\n\r\nWotton was celebrated for his hospitality, and was much beloved and\r\nrespected by all who knew him. He was also a patron of learning, and\r\npossessed a fine and extensive collection of books, remarkable for their\r\nhandsome bindings. They are generally ornamented in a style similar to\r\nthat used on the volumes bound for Grolier, whose motto he adopted.\r\nAlthough the majority of the bindings executed for him bear the legend\r\nTHOMAE WOTTONI ET AMICORVM as the only mark of their ownership, they are\r\nsometimes impressed with his arms.\r\n\r\nIzaak Walton, in his _Life of Sir Henry Wotton_, states that Thomas\r\nWotton 'was a gentleman excellently educated, and studious in all the\r\nliberal arts, in the knowledge whereof he attained unto great\r\nperfection; who though he had--besides those abilities, a very noble and\r\nplentiful estate, and the ancient interest of his predecessors--many\r\ninvitations from Queen Elizabeth to change his country recreations and\r\nretirement for a court life:--offering him a knighthood, and that to be\r\nbut as an earnest of some more honourable and more profitable employment\r\nunder her; yet he humbly refused both, being a man of great modesty, of\r\na most plain and single heart, of an ancient freedom, and integrity of\r\nmind.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Edwards, _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_\r\n(London, 1870), p. 426.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. DEE, 1527-1608\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. John Dee, 'that perfect astronomer, curious astrologer and serious\r\ngeometrician,' as he is styled by Lilly, was born in London on the 13th\r\nof July 1527. He was the son of Rowland Dee, who, according to Wood, was\r\na wealthy vintner, but who is described by Strype as Gentleman Sewer to\r\nHenry VIII. In his _Compendious Rehearsal_ Dee informs us that he\r\npossessed a very fine collection of books, 'printed and anciently\r\nwritten, bound and unbound, in all near 4000, the fourth part of which\r\nwere written books. The value of all which books, by the estimation of\r\nmen skilful in the arts, whereof the books did and do intreat, and that\r\nin divers languages, was well worth 2000 lib.'; and he adds that he\r\n'spent 40 years in divers places beyond the seas, and in England in\r\ngetting these books together.' He specially mentions 'that four written\r\nbooks, one in Greek, two in French, and one in High Dutch cost 533 lib.'\r\nHis library also contained a 'great case or frame of boxes, wherein some\r\nhundreds of very rare evidences of divers Irelandish territories,\r\nprovinces and lands were laid up; and divers evidences ancient of some\r\nWelsh princes and noblemen, their great gifts of lands to the\r\nfoundations or enrichings of Sundry Houses of Religious men. Some also\r\nwere there the like of the Normans donations and gifts about and some\r\nyears after the Conquest.' Dee, in a letter from Antwerp to Sir William\r\nCecil, afterwards Lord Burghley, dated February 16, 1563, also states\r\nthat he had purchased a curious book (probably a manuscript),\r\n_Steganographia_, by Joannes Trithemius, which was so rare that '1000\r\ncrowns had been offered in vain' for a copy. Dee placed his library in\r\nhis house at Mortlake, Surrey, and so great was its repute, that on the\r\n10th of March 1575, Queen Elizabeth, attended by many of her courtiers,\r\npaid him a visit for the purpose of examining it; but learning that his\r\nwife had been buried that day, she would not enter the house, but\r\nrequested him to show her his famous magic glass, and describe its\r\nproperties, which he accordingly did 'to her Majesty's great contentment\r\nand delight.' In 1583, during his absence on the Continent, the\r\npopulace, who execrated him as 'a caller of divels,' broke into his\r\nhouse and destroyed a great part of his furniture, collections, and\r\nlibrary. On his return to his home in 1589, he succeeded in regaining\r\nabout three-fourths of his books; but these were gradually dispersed in\r\nconsequence of the pecuniary difficulties he was in during the latter\r\nyears of his life. Lilly states that 'he died very poor, enforced many\r\ntimes to sell some book or other to buy his dinner with.' An autograph\r\ncatalogue of both his printed and manuscript books, dated September 6,\r\n1583, is preserved among the Harleian manuscripts in the British\r\nMuseum.[17] His private diary, and a catalogue of his manuscripts, were\r\nedited in 1842 for the Camden Society by Mr. J.O. Halliwell, F.R.S.,\r\nfrom the original manuscripts in the Ashmolean Museum and Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge. Another portion of his diary, preserved in the\r\nBodleian Library, was edited by Mr. J.E. Baily, F.S.A., and printed\r\n(twenty copies only) at London in 1880. In 1556 Dee presented to Queen\r\nMary 'A Supplication for the recovery and preservation of ancient\r\nWriters and Monuments.' In this interesting document he laments the\r\nspoil and destruction of so many and so notable libraries through the\r\nsubverting of religious houses, and suggests that a commission should be\r\nappointed with power to demand that all possessors of manuscripts\r\nthroughout the realm should send their books to be copied for the\r\nQueen's library, so that it might 'in a very few years most plentifully\r\nbe furnished, and that without one penny charge to the Queen, or doing\r\ninjury to any creature.' He himself undertook to procure copies of the\r\nfamous manuscripts at the Vatican, St. Mark's, Venice, Bologna,\r\nFlorence, Vienna, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. DEE. From the Ashmolean portrait as engraved by\r\nSchencker.]\r\n\r\nDee wrote a large number of works, but comparatively few of them have\r\nbeen printed. No fewer than seventy-nine are enumerated in Coopers'\r\n_Athenae Cantabrigienses_. A catalogue of his writings, printed and\r\nunprinted, is given in his _Compendious Rehearsal_. Many of his\r\nmanuscripts came into the possession of Elias Ashmole, the eminent\r\nantiquary.\r\n\r\nAubrey says of Dee that 'he was a great peace-maker; if any of the\r\nneighbours fell out, he would never let them alone till he had made them\r\nfriends. He was tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown,\r\nwith hanging sleeves, and a slit. He had a very fair, clear, sanguine\r\ncomplexion, a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man.'\r\n\r\nHe died in December 1608, and was buried in the chancel of Mortlake\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Harl. MSS._ 1879.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT DUDLEY, EARL OF LEICESTER, 1532?-1588\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Dudley, Baron Denbigh, and Earl of Leicester, the favourite of\r\nElizabeth, was born on the 24th of June in 1532 or 1533. He was the\r\nfifth son of John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who was executed in\r\nAugust 1553 for maintaining the claims of Lady Jane Grey, his\r\ndaughter-in-law, to the crown. He was himself condemned to death for the\r\npart he took in the attempt of his father to place Lady Jane upon the\r\nthrone; but on the intercession of the Lords of the Council was pardoned\r\nby Queen Mary, who received him into favour, and appointed him master of\r\nthe English ordnance at the siege of St. Quentin, where his brother\r\nHenry was killed. On the accession of Elizabeth, Dudley soon became a\r\ngreat favourite of the Queen, who advanced him to the highest honours,\r\nand, there is little doubt, at one time contemplated a marriage with\r\nhim. Leicester was a generous supporter of learning, and his letters\r\nshow that he was himself possessed of considerable literary ability.\r\nGeoffrey Whitney, in his dedication of his _Choice of Emblems_ to the\r\nEarl, mentions 'his zeale and honourable care of those that love good\r\nletters,' and states that 'divers, who are nowe famous men, had bin\r\nthrough povertie longe since discouraged from their studies if they had\r\nnot founde your honour so prone to bee their patron.' Little is known\r\nrespecting Leicester's library, which must have been a large and fine\r\none, for many handsomely bound volumes which once belonged to it are\r\nfound both in public and private collections. This dispersion of his\r\nbooks may probably be accounted for by the sale of his goods after his\r\ndeath, as mentioned by Camden in his _Annals of the Reign of Elizabeth_:\r\n'But whereas he was in the Queen's debt, his goods were sold at a public\r\nOutcry: for the Queen, though in other things she were favourable\r\nenough, yet seldom or never did she remit the debts owing to her\r\nTreasury.' In the _Notices of London Libraries_, by John Bagford and\r\nWilliam Oldys, it is stated: 'At Lambeth Palace over the Cloyster is a\r\nwell-furnished library. The oldest of the books were Dudley's, Earl of\r\nLeicester.' Not more, however, than nine or ten which belonged to the\r\nEarl are to be found there now. Almost all his books have his well-known\r\ncrest, the bear and ragged staff, stamped upon the covers, but a few of\r\nthem bear his arms instead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF LORD LEICESTER.]\r\n\r\nLeicester was suddenly seized with illness on his way to Kenilworth, and\r\ndied at his house at Cornbury, in Oxfordshire, on the 4th of September\r\n1588. The suddenness of his death gave rise to a suspicion that it was\r\ncaused by poison; and Ben Jonson tells a story that he had given his\r\nwife 'a bottle of liquor which he willed her to use in any faintness,\r\nwhich she, not knowing it was poison, gave him, and so he died.' He was\r\nburied at Warwick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN, LORD LUMLEY, 1534?-1609.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn, Lord Lumley, was born in or about the year 1534. He was the only\r\nson of George Lumley of Twing, in the county of Yorkshire, who was\r\nexecuted in 1537 at Tyburn, for high treason. On the death of his\r\ngrandfather, Lord Lumley, in 1544, John succeeded to the family estates,\r\nand in 1547 he was permitted to take the title of Baron Lumley. He\r\nmatriculated in May 1549, as a fellow-commoner of Queens' College,\r\nCambridge, and was also educated in the court of King Edward VI., whose\r\nfuneral he attended. On the 29th of September 1553 he was created a\r\nKnight of the Bath, and, two days later, was present, together with his\r\nwife, at the coronation of Queen Mary;[18] Lady Lumley riding in the\r\nthird chariot with five other baronesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD LUMLEY. From the Cheam portrait as engraved for\r\nSandford.]\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Queen Elizabeth, he, with other lords, was appointed\r\nto attend her Majesty on her journey from Hatfield to London. In 1559\r\nhis father-in-law, the Earl of Arundel, at that time Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, nominated him High Steward of the University.\r\nLord Lumley was sent to the Tower in 1569 on suspicion of being\r\nimplicated in intrigues to bring about the marriage of his\r\nbrother-in-law the Duke of Norfolk with Mary, Queen of Scots, and to\r\nre-establish the Roman Catholic religion. In the next year he was\r\nreleased, but in October 1571 he was again imprisoned, and he did not\r\nobtain his liberty until April 1573, ten months after the execution of\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk. At a later period he appears to have quite regained\r\nthe favour of the Queen, for we read that she accepted as a New Year's\r\ngift from him in 1584 'a cup of cristall graven and garnished with\r\ngolde,' and that at the New Year 1587 he presented to her 'a booke,\r\nwherein are divers Psalmes in Lattin written, the boards greate,\r\ninclosed all over on the outeside with golde enamuld cut-worke, with\r\ndivers colours and one litle claspe.'[19] In 1580 Lord Lumley lost his\r\nfather-in-law, who by a deed, dated March 14th, 1566, had conveyed a\r\ngreat part of his estates to Lord Lumley and Jane his eldest daughter,\r\nLord Lumley's wife; and after her decease, Lord Arundel confirmed the\r\nsame to Lord Lumley by his will, which he made a few months before his\r\ndeath. Among the estates bequeathed were the palace and park of Nonsuch,\r\nwhich in 1590 Lord Lumley conveyed to the Queen in exchange for lands of\r\nthe yearly value of five hundred and thirty-four pounds. Lord Lumley\r\ndied on the 11th of April 1609 at his residence on Tower Hill, in the\r\nparish of St. Olave, Hart Street, and was buried in Cheam church, in the\r\ncounty of Surrey, where a monument was erected to his memory in the\r\nLumley aisle, which he had built. By his first wife, Jane, who died in\r\n1577, Lord Lumley had three children, who all died in infancy. He had\r\nno issue by his second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John, Lord Darcy of\r\nChiche, who survived him nine years.\r\n\r\nLord Lumley, Bishop Hacket says, 'did pursue Recondite Learning as much\r\nas any of his Honourable Rank in those Times, and was the owner of a\r\nmost precious Library, the search and collection of Mr. Humfry\r\nLlyd.'[20] This fine library, which to a great extent was formed by the\r\nbooks bequeathed to him by his father-in-law in 1580, contained many\r\nvolumes which had evidently been once the property of Archbishop\r\nCranmer, as they bear his name, which is sometimes accompanied by the\r\nsignature of Lumley, and in other instances by the signatures of both\r\nArundel and Lumley. Lord Lumley also collected a number of portraits.\r\n\r\nLord Lumley made liberal donations of books to the University Library of\r\nCambridge and the Bodleian Library during his lifetime, and also\r\n'bestowed many excellent Pieces printed and manuscript upon Mr.\r\nWilliams[21] for alliance sake.' After his death in 1609 the remainder\r\nof his library, 'which was probably more valuable than any other\r\ncollection then existing in England, with the exception of that of Sir\r\nRobert Cotton,'[22] was purchased by Henry, Prince of Wales. At the\r\nPrince's decease in 1612 the books went to augment the old royal library\r\nof England, which was given to the nation in 1757 by King George II. A\r\ncurious and interesting inventory of the 'moveables' found at Lumley\r\nCastle after the death of its owner is given in Surtees's _History of\r\nDurham_, vol. ii. pp. 158-163. The goods comprised pictures, sculptures,\r\n'peeces of hangines of arras with golde of the Storie of Troye, Quene\r\nHester, Cipio and Haniball,' etc., hangings of 'gilte leather,' 'Beddes'\r\nof gold, silver, and silk, splendid chairs, and velvet and Turkey\r\ncarpets, and were valued at fourteen hundred and four pounds, seventeen\r\nshillings and eightpence, but no mention is made of any books. Most of\r\nthese treasures were sold by auction at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Among the Royal MSS. preserved in the British Museum is a\r\ntranslation of Erasmus's _Institutio Principis Christiani_, signed 'Your\r\nlordshippes obedient sone, J. Lumley, 1550.' As Lord Lumley's own father\r\nwas put to death in 1537, this was evidently addressed to his\r\nfather-in-law, who has written his name Arundel on the first page. Lord\r\nLumley was a member of the old Society of Antiquaries, and in\r\nconjunction with Dr. Caldwell[23] he founded a surgery lecture in the\r\nRoyal College of Physicians, endowing it with forty pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nThe Lumley family was one of considerable importance and antiquity, and\r\nan amusing account is given by Pennant[24] and Hutchinson[25] of a visit\r\npaid by King James I. to Lumley Castle on the 13th of April 1603. In the\r\nabsence of Lord Lumley the King was received by Dr. James, Dean of\r\nDurham, 'who expatiated on the pedigree of their noble host, without\r\nmissing a single ancestor, direct or collateral, from Liulph to Lord\r\nLumley, till the King, wearied with the eternal blazon, interrupted him,\r\n\"Oh mon, gang na further; let me digest the knowledge I ha gained, for\r\non my saul I did na ken Adam's name was Lumley.\"'\r\n\r\nLord Lumley's first wife was a very learned lady, and several volumes\r\ncontaining the exercises both of herself and her sister, the Duchess of\r\nNorfolk, are preserved among the Royal MSS. in the British Museum,\r\nhaving been handed down with the Lumley books. A quarto volume,[26] upon\r\nthe first leaf of which is written 'The doinge of my Lady Lumley,\r\ndowghter to my L. Therle of Arundell,' contains Latin translations of\r\nseveral of the Orations of Isocrates, and 'The Tragedie of Euripides\r\ncalled Iphigeneia, translated out of Greake into Englisshe.' Among the\r\nroyal manuscripts is also to be found a beautiful little volume of\r\nfourteen vellum leaves,[27] containing copies of moral apophthegms, in\r\nLatin, which Sir Nicholas Bacon had inscribed on the walls of his house\r\nat Gorhambury. On the first page, above the arms of Lady Lumley, which\r\nare splendidly emblazoned, is written in gold capitals, 'Syr . Nicholas\r\n. Bacon . Knyghte . to . his . very . good . ladye . the . ladye .\r\nLumley . sendeth . this,' and on the second page this title, 'Sentences\r\nprinted in the Lorde Kepar's Gallery at Gorhambury: selected by him out\r\nof divers authors, and sent to the good ladye Lumley at her desire.' The\r\nsentences, which are thirty-seven in number, are inscribed in gold\r\ncapital letters upon grounds of various colours.\r\n\r\nThere are three portraits of Lord Lumley at Lumley Castle, and one at\r\nArundel Castle. A fine engraving of another portrait, which was formerly\r\nin the Lumley aisle at Cheam, is in Stebbing's edition of Sandford's\r\n_Genealogical History_. There are also engravings of Lord Lumley by\r\nFittler and Thane. Lumley Castle also contains a portrait of Lady\r\nLumley, inscribed 'Jane Fitzalan, daughter to Henry Earle of Arundele,\r\nfirst wife to John Lord Lumley.'[28]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Cooper, _Athenae Cantabrigienses_, vol. ii. p. 517.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Cooper.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Humphrey Llwyd, physician and antiquary, Lord Lumley's\r\nbrother-in-law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Afterwards Archbishop of York, a relative of Lord Lumley.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Edwards, _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, p.\r\n162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Richard Caldwell, M.D., elected President of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians in 1570.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Pennant, _Tour in Scotland, etc_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Hutchinson, _History of County of Durham_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _Royal MSS._, 15 A ix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: _Royal MSS._, 17 A xxiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Cooper.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE CAREW, EARL OF TOTNES, 1555-1629\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF EARL OF TOTNES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Carew, Baron Carew of Clopton and Earl of Totnes, was born in\r\n1555. He was the son of George Carew, Dean of Windsor, by his wife Anne,\r\ndaughter of Sir Nicholas Harvey. In 1564 he was sent to the University\r\nof Oxford, which he left in 1573, and in the following year went to\r\nIreland and entered the service of his cousin Sir Peter Carew, who was\r\nthen engaged in prosecuting his claims to his Irish property. Carew held\r\nvarious posts in that country, and remained there, save for visits to\r\nEngland and the Low Countries, until 1592, when he entered upon his\r\nduties as Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, to which office he had\r\nbeen appointed in 1591. He took part in the expeditions of Essex to\r\nCadiz in 1596, and to the Azores in 1597, and in 1599 returned to\r\nIreland as Lord President of Munster, a post he held until 1603. In 1605\r\nhe was made Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Anne, and in the same year was\r\ncreated Baron Carew. Three years later he was made Master of the\r\nOrdnance, and in 1611 he again went to Ireland as 'Sole Commissioner for\r\nthe reformation of the army and improvement of his majesties revenew.'\r\nOn the 5th of February 1626, Carew, who had been knighted in 1585, was\r\ncreated Earl of Totnes, and later in the year received the appointment\r\nof 'Treasurer and receaver-general to queene Henriette Marie.'\r\n\r\nHe died at London on the 27th of March 1629, and was buried in the\r\nChurch of Stratford-on-Avon, where a monument was erected to his memory\r\nby his widow, a daughter of William Clopton, of Clopton House, near\r\nStratford-on-Avon. He left no children by her.\r\n\r\nCarew, who was much attached to antiquarian pursuits, maintained a large\r\ncorrespondence with Camden, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Robert Cotton, and\r\nSir Thomas Bodley, and many of his letters have been printed by the\r\nCamden Society. He bequeathed his books and manuscripts, of which he had\r\nacquired a considerable number, to Sir Thomas Stafford, who was said to\r\nbe his illegitimate son. They afterwards became the property of\r\nArchbishop Laud, who placed forty-two of the volumes of manuscripts,\r\nwhich principally relate to Irish history in the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth, in the Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth, and four in the\r\nBodleian Library. Others are preserved in the Department of M., British\r\nMuseum, the State Paper Office, and at Hatfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT BRUCE COTTON, BART., 1571-1631\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Robert Bruce Cotton, who is styled by Sir Symonds D'Ewes 'England's\r\nPrime Antiquary,' was born in 1571. He was the eldest son of Thomas\r\nCotton, of Connington, Huntingdonshire, by his first wife, Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Francis Shirley of Staunton-Harold, Leicestershire. He\r\nreceived his early education at Westminster School, and in 1581\r\nmatriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge, where four years later he\r\ntook the degree of B.A. At a very early age he became a member of the\r\nElizabethan Society of Antiquaries, which met for many years at his\r\nresidence in Westminster, near Palace Yard. It was in this house that he\r\nformed that magnificent collection of manuscripts and other antiquities\r\nwhich now ranks as one of the principal treasures of the British Museum.\r\nThe dissolution of the monasteries in the reigns of Henry VIII. and\r\nEdward VI. afforded special facilities to Cotton in forming the\r\ncollection which comprises such valuable manuscripts as the famous\r\n_Durham Book_ (a copy of the Gospels in Latin, written and illuminated\r\nin honour of St. Cuthbert by Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, between\r\nthe years 698 and 720, with an interlinear translation in Northumbrian\r\nSaxon), and the copy of the Gospels said to have been used to administer\r\nthe oath at the coronation of King Athelstan. Other treasures are the\r\noriginal Bull of Pope Leo X. conferring on King Henry VIII. the title of\r\nDefender of the Faith; and a contemporary and official copy of Magna\r\nCharta, granted by King John, and dated at Runnymede, 15th June, in the\r\nseventeenth year of his reign, which was given to Cotton by Sir Edward\r\nDering. Both these precious documents were unfortunately damaged by the\r\nfire at Ashburnham House, but have since been very skilfully repaired.\r\nMore than two hundred volumes of the library consisted of letters of\r\nsovereigns and statesmen; but Cotton did not acquire these valuable\r\ndocuments without creating a strong feeling that such a large and\r\nimportant collection of official papers should rather be preserved in\r\nthe Record Office than left in the possession of a private individual,\r\nand his library was twice sequestrated by the Government. On the first\r\noccasion his books were given back to him; but on the second, although\r\nhe repeatedly petitioned the King for their restoration, he died before\r\nhis applications were answered. His death took place at his house in\r\nWestminster on the 6th of May 1631, and he was buried in Connington\r\nChurch, where a monument was erected to his memory. Cotton was knighted\r\non the accession of James I., and was also one of the baronets created\r\nby that sovereign in 1611. Sir Robert Cotton gave directions in his will\r\nthat his library should not be sold, and bequeathed it to his son, Sir\r\nThomas Cotton, who on the decease of his father made great efforts to\r\nobtain its restoration, which were ultimately successful. He died in\r\n1662, leaving the collection to his son, Sir John Cotton, who, having\r\ndeclined an offer for it of sixty thousand pounds from Louis XIV. in\r\n1700, expressed his intention of practically giving it to the nation;\r\nand in the same year an Act was passed, enacting that on the death of\r\nSir John (he died in 1702), Cotton House, together with the collection,\r\nshould be vested in trustees, but at the same time continue in his\r\nfamily and name, and not be sold or otherwise disposed of. It was\r\nfurther ordered that the library should be kept and preserved for public\r\nuse and advantage, and that a room should be provided for it, with 'a\r\nconvenient way, passage, and resort to the same, at the will and\r\ndiscretion of the heirs of the family.' Obstacles, however, occurred in\r\ncarrying out these directions, principally on account of the difficulty\r\nof access to the library, and the unsuitableness of the room in which it\r\nwas deposited, it being described as 'a narrow little room, damp, and\r\nimproper for preserving the books and papers.' An agreement was\r\ntherefore made, by virtue of an Act of Parliament (5 Anne, cap. 30),\r\nwith Sir John Cotton, grandson of the Sir John Cotton who died in 1702,\r\nfor the purchase of the inheritance of the house where the library was\r\ndeposited for the sum of four thousand five hundred pounds; and it was\r\nfurther provided that the library should continue to be settled in\r\ntrustees, and a convenient room built in part of the grounds for its\r\naccommodation. This, however, was not done, and the dilapidated\r\ncondition of Cotton House soon necessitated the removal of the\r\ncollection, which was taken to Essex House, Essex Street, Strand, where\r\nit remained until 1730, when it was conveyed to Ashburnham House in\r\nLittle Dean's Yard, Westminster, which was purchased by the Crown to\r\nreceive it, together with the royal MSS. Here, on the 23rd of October\r\n1731, the disastrous fire broke out in which one hundred and fourteen\r\nmanuscripts were burnt, lost, or entirely spoiled, and ninety-eight\r\ndamaged, but many of these have been cleverly restored. Those which were\r\nsaved were placed in a new building designed for the dormitory of\r\nWestminster School, where they remained until they were transferred to\r\nthe British Museum in 1757, having been included in the Act under which\r\nthe Museum was founded in 1753.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ROBERT COTTON. From an engraving by R. White.]\r\n\r\nThe Cottonian Collection originally consisted of 958 volumes. A\r\ncatalogue of it was compiled by Dr. Thomas Smith in 1696, and a more\r\nample one by Mr. Joseph Planta, Principal Librarian of the British\r\nMuseum, in 1802.\r\n\r\n                    'Omnis ab illo\r\n  Et Camdene tua, et Seldeni gloria crevit.'[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LAUD, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, 1573-1645\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose eventful history is well\r\nknown, was born at Reading on the 7th of October 1573. He was the son of\r\na clothier of that town, and was first educated in the free grammar\r\nschool of his native place, and afterwards proceeded to St. John's\r\nCollege, Oxford, where he successively obtained a scholarship and a\r\nfellowship, and in 1611 became President of the College. In 1616 James\r\nI. conferred on him the Deanery of Gloucester, on the 22nd of January\r\n1621 he was installed as a prebendary of Westminster, and on the 29th of\r\nJune in the same year he obtained the See of St. David's. On the\r\naccession of Charles I. to the throne Laud's influence became very\r\ngreat, and in 1626 he was made Bishop of Bath and Wells, and two years\r\nlater Bishop of London. In 1630 he was elected Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, and in 1633 he was appointed Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury. Shortly after the meeting of the Long Parliament in 1640\r\nLaud was impeached of treason by the House of Commons, and committed to\r\nthe Tower. After an imprisonment of three years he was brought to trial\r\nbefore the Lords, but as they showed an inclination to acquit him, the\r\nCommons passed an ordinance of attainder, declaring him guilty of\r\ntreason, to which they compelled the Peers to assent, and on the 10th of\r\nJanuary 1645 he was brought to the scaffold on Tower Hill. His body was\r\ninterred in the chancel of All Hallows, Barking, where it remained until\r\n1663, when it was removed to the Chapel of St. John's College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Laud was an ardent collector of books, especially of\r\nmanuscripts, but Wood in his _Athenae Oxonienses_ says he was 'such a\r\nliberal benefactor towards the advancement of learning that he left\r\nhimself little or nothing for his own use.' The Bodleian Library is\r\nindebted to him for a large portion of its choicest treasures,\r\nespecially of Oriental literature. Between the years 1635 and 1640 he\r\nenriched the Library with repeated gifts of valuable manuscripts. In\r\n1635 he presented four hundred and sixty-two volumes and five rolls.\r\nAmong these were forty-six Latin manuscripts, 'e Collegio Herbipolensi\r\n[Wuerzburg] in Germania sumpti, A.D. 1631, cum Suecorum Regis exercitus\r\nper universam fere Germaniam grassarentur.' This gift was followed, in\r\n1636, by another of one hundred and eighty-one manuscripts. In the next\r\nyear five hundred and fifty-five additional manuscripts were given by\r\nhim to the Library, and in 1640 eighty-one more. This splendid donation\r\nof nearly thirteen hundred manuscripts comprised works in Oriental and\r\nmany other languages; a large number of them being of exceptional value\r\nand interest. Among them was a manuscript of the Acts of the Apostles in\r\nGreek and Latin, of the end of the seventh century, which is believed to\r\nhave been once in the possession of the Venerable Bede. Other notable\r\nmanuscripts were an Irish vellum manuscript containing the Psalter of\r\nCashel, Cormac's Glossary, Poems attributed to St. Columb-Kill and St.\r\nPatrick, etc., and a copy of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which ends at\r\nthe year 1154, and appears to have been written in, and to have\r\nformerly been the property of, the Abbey of Peterborough. In addition to\r\nthe manuscripts, the Archbishop presented the Library with a collection\r\nof coins, and other antiquities and curiosities.[30] Archbishop Laud was\r\nalso a great benefactor to his own college, St. John's. Sir Kenelm Digby\r\nin a letter to Dr. Gerard Langbaine, dated Gothurst, November 7th, 1654,\r\nwrites: 'As I was one day waiting on the late King, my master, I told\r\nhim of a collection of choice Arabic Manuscripts I was sending after my\r\nLatin ones to the University. My Lord of Canterbury [Laud] that was\r\npresent, wished that they might go along with a parcel that he was\r\nsending to St. John's College: whereupon I sent them to his Grace, as\r\nChancellor of the University, beseeching him to present them in my name\r\nto the same place where he sent his. They were in two trunks (made\r\nexactly fit for them) that had the first letters of my christian and\r\nsirname decyphered upon them with nails; and on the first page of every\r\nbook was my ordinary motto and name written at length in my own hand.\r\nThe troubles of the times soon followed my sending these trunks of books\r\nto Lambeth-house, and I was banished out of the land, and returned not\r\nuntil my lord was dead; so that I never more heard of them.'[31]\r\n\r\nSome curious entries in the Journals of the House of Commons show that\r\nthe books which the Archbishop retained for his own use fell into the\r\nhands of Hugh Peters, the regicide.\r\n\r\n'Ao. 1643-4, March 8. Ordered, That a Study of books to the value of\r\none hundred pounds out of such books as are sequestered, be forthwith\r\nbestowed upon Mr. Peters.'\r\n\r\n'Ao. 1644, 25 April. Whereas this House was formerly pleased to bestow\r\nupon Mr. Peters, Books to the Value of an Hundred Pounds, it is this day\r\nordered, that Mr. Recorder, Mr. Whitlock and Mr. Hill, or any Two of\r\nthem, do cause to be delivered unto Mr. Peters Books of the Value of an\r\nHundred Pounds, out of the particular and private study of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and out of the Books belonging to the said\r\nArchbishop, in his own particular.'\r\n\r\n'Ao. 1644, 27 Junij. Whereas formerly Books to the Value of an Hundred\r\nPounds were bestowed upon Mr. Peters, out of the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury's particular private Study: And whereas the said Study is\r\nappraised at a matter of Forty Pounds more than the said Hundred Pounds;\r\nIt is this day ordered, That Mr. Peters shall have the whole Study of\r\nBooks freely bestowed upon him.'\r\n\r\nThese books, however, appear to have been recovered after the\r\nRestoration, for we find an entry in the Journals of the date of May 16,\r\n1660, ordering 'That it be referred to the Committee to whom the\r\nBusiness of Secretary Thurloe is referred, to take Order, that all the\r\nBooks and Papers, heretofore belonging to the Library of the late\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, and now, or lately, in the Hands of Mr. Hugh\r\nPeters, be forthwith secured.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other benefactions to the University of Oxford,\r\nArchbishop Laud founded in that university a Professorship of Arabic,\r\nand endowed it with lands in the parish of Bray, in the county of Berks.\r\n\r\nThe works written by Laud are but few in number. They are _Officium\r\nQuotidianum, or a Manual of Private Devotions_; _A Summary of\r\nDevotions_; his _Diary_; and _A History of his Troubles and Tryal_;\r\ntogether with some smaller pieces, sermons, and speeches. _A Relation of\r\nthe Conference between him and Fisher the Jesuit_, by Laud's chaplain\r\nJohn Baily, was printed in 1624. A collected edition of his works,\r\nedited by Henry Wharton, was printed in 1695-1700, and a second one in\r\nthe Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, in six volumes in 1847-49.\r\n\r\nPortraits of him are to be found in St. John's College, Oxford, and at\r\nLambeth Palace. A copy of the last portrait, by Henry Stone, is in the\r\nNational Portrait Gallery.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Preface to Weaver's _Funeral Monuments_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_, pp. 61-65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Walker, _Letters by Eminent Persons_. London, 1813.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BURTON, 1576-1640\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Burton, the author of _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, who is\r\nnumbered by Dibdin 'among the most marked bibliomaniacs of the age,' was\r\nthe second son of Ralph Burton of Lindley in the county of Leicester,\r\nand was born on the 8th of February 1576. He received the early part of\r\nhis education at the grammar schools of Nuneaton and Sutton Coldfield.\r\nIn 1593 he was admitted a commoner at Brasenose College, Oxford, and in\r\n1599 was elected a student of Christ Church. He took the degree of B.D.\r\nin 1614. The last-named college presented him with the vicarage of St.\r\nThomas, in the west suburb of Oxford, in 1616, and some years later\r\nGeorge, Lord Berkeley, gave him the rectory of Segrave in\r\nLeicestershire. The first edition of his famous work, _The Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy_, appeared in 1621. Burton, about whose life little is known,\r\ndied in his chamber at Christ's Church on the 25th of January 1639-40,\r\n'at, or very near that time,' Anthony a Wood writes, 'which he had some\r\nyears before foretold from the calculation of his own nativity. Which\r\nbeing exact, several of the students did not forbear to whisper among\r\nthemselves, that rather than there should be a mistake in the\r\ncalculation, he sent up his soul to heaven thro' a slip about his neck.'\r\nWood adds that he was buried in the north aisle of Christ Church\r\nCathedral, and over his grave 'was erected a comely monument on the\r\nupper pillar of the said isle with his bust painted to the life: on the\r\nright hand of which, is the calculation of his nativity, and under the\r\nbust this inscription made by himself; all put up by the care of William\r\nBurton, his brother.\r\n\r\n'Paucis notus, paucioribus ignotus, hic jacet Democritus junior, cui\r\nvitam dedit & mortem Melancholia. Obiit viii. Id. Jan. A.C. MDCXXXIX.'\r\n\r\nBurton's monument and bust have been engraved for Nichols's _History and\r\nAntiquities of Leicestershire_, and his portrait hangs in the hall of\r\nBrasenose College.\r\n\r\nWood gives the following character of Burton:--'He was an exact\r\nmathematician, a curious calculator of nativities, a general-read\r\nscholar, a thorough-paced philologist, and one that understood the\r\nsurveying of lands well. As he was by many accounted a severe student, a\r\ndevourer of authors, a melancholy and humourous person, so by others who\r\nknew him well, a person of great honesty, plain dealing and charity. I\r\nhave heard some of the ancients of Christchurch often say that his\r\ncompany was very merry, facete and juvenile; and no man in his time did\r\nsurpass him for his ready and dexterous interlarding his common\r\ndiscourses among them with verses from the poets, or sentences from\r\nclassical authors; which, being then all the fashion in the university,\r\nmade his company more acceptable.'\r\n\r\nBurton left behind him a large and curious collection of books, the\r\nnature of which he well describes in his Address to the Reader of his\r\n_Anatomy of Melancholy_: 'I hear new news every day, and those ordinary\r\nrumours of war, plagues, fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres,\r\nmeteors, comets, spectrums, prodigies, apparitions, of towns taken,\r\ncities besieged in France, Germany, Turkey, Persia, Poland, etc., daily\r\nmusters and preparations, and such like, which these tempestuous times\r\nafford, battles fought, so many men slain, monomachies, shipwrecks,\r\npiracies, and sea-fights; peace, leagues, stratagems, and fresh\r\nalarms.... New books every day, pamphlets, currantoes, stories, whole\r\ncatalogues of volumes of all sorts.... Now come tidings of weddings,\r\nmaskings, mummeries, entertainments, jubilies, embassies, tilts and\r\ntournaments, trophies, triumphs, revels, sports, plays: then again, as\r\nin a new shifted scene, treasons, cheating tricks, robberies, enormous\r\nvillanies in all kinds, funerals, burials, deaths of princes, new\r\ndiscoveries, expeditions, now comical, then tragical matters.' He\r\nappears to have purchased indiscriminately almost everything that was\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nIn his will, dated August 15th, 1639, he gives directions for the\r\ndisposal of his books:--\r\n\r\n'Now for my goods I thus dispose them. First I give an Cth pounds to\r\nChrist Church in Oxford where I have so long lived to buy five pounds\r\nLands per Ann. to be Yearly bestowed on Books for the Library. Item I\r\ngive an hundreth pound to the University Library of Oxford to be\r\nbestowed to purchase five pound Land per Ann. to be paid out Yearly on\r\nBooks.... If I have any Books the University Library hath not, let them\r\ntake them. If I have any Books our own Library hath not, let them take\r\nthem.' After bequeathing books to various friends, he directs, 'If any\r\nbooks be left let my Executors dispose of them with all such books as\r\nare written with my own hands and half my Melancholy Copy for Crips hath\r\nthe other half. To Mr. Jones Chaplin and Chanter my Surveying Books and\r\nInstruments.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, Burton wrote a Latin comedy,\r\nentitled _Philosophaster_, which was acted at Christ Church on Shrove\r\nMonday, February the 16th, 1618, and which was first printed in 1862 for\r\nthe Roxburghe Club at the expense of the late Rev. W.E. Buckley, of\r\nMiddleton Chaney, the possessor of one of two manuscripts of it which\r\nhave been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES USHER, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH, 1581-1656\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHBISHOP USHER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Usher or Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, was born in Dublin on the\r\n4th of January 1581. He was the second, but elder surviving son of\r\nArland Usher, one of the six clerks of the Irish Court of Chancery. His\r\nmother was a daughter of James Stanyhurst, Recorder of the City of\r\nDublin, who was thrice elected Speaker of the Irish House of Commons.\r\nUsher is said to have been taught to read by two aunts who had been\r\nblind from their infancy. At the age of eight he was sent to a school in\r\nDublin conducted by Mr. James Fullerton and Mr. James Hamilton, two\r\nsecret political agents of King James of Scotland, who were afterwards\r\nmade Sir James Fullerton and Viscount Clandeboye. In 1594 he proceeded\r\nto Trinity College, Dublin, being the second scholar admitted in the\r\nnewly opened University, of which he was made a Fellow in 1599. On the\r\n20th of December 1601 he was ordained by his uncle, the Archbishop of\r\nArmagh, having first made over his paternal inheritance to his younger\r\nbrother and his sisters, reserving only a small portion for his support\r\nduring his studies. On the 24th of the same month the Spaniards were\r\ndefeated at the battle of Kinsale by the English and Irish, and the\r\nofficers of the English army determined to commemorate their success by\r\nfounding a library in the College at Dublin. They collected among\r\nthemselves about eighteen hundred pounds for this purpose,[32] and\r\nUsher, in conjunction with Dr. Luke Challoner, was requested to select\r\nthe books. For this object, in 1602, he paid a visit to England, where\r\nhe made the acquaintance of Sir Thomas Bodley, Sir Robert Cotton,\r\nCamden, and other distinguished persons. In 1606 he again made a journey\r\nto England, this time to buy books for his own library, as well as for\r\nthat of his college,[33] and for some time he repeated his visits every\r\nthree or four years. In 1607 he was made Professor of Divinity in\r\nTrinity College, which office he held for thirteen years. He was\r\nconsecrated Bishop of Meath and Clonmacnoise in 1621, and four years\r\nlater he was raised to the Archbishopric of Armagh and the Primacy of\r\nthe Irish Church. Usher came to England on a visit in 1640, but he never\r\nreturned to his native country, for in the next year his residence at\r\nArmagh was attacked and plundered by the rebels, and he lost everything\r\nhe possessed except his library, and some furniture in his house at\r\nDrogheda. In consequence of the unsettled state of the country it was\r\nthought useless for him to return to his see, and the king therefore\r\nbestowed on him the bishopric of Carlisle, to be held _in commendam_.\r\nFor some time he resided in Oxford, but that city being threatened with\r\na siege by the Parliamentary forces, in 1645 he proceeded to Cardiff, of\r\nwhich town Sir Timothy Tyrrell, who had married his only child, was\r\ngovernor. Some months later, when Tyrrell was obliged to give up his\r\ncommand, Usher accepted an invitation from Mary, widow of Sir Edward\r\nStradling, to take up his abode at her residence, St. Donat's Castle,\r\nGlamorganshire. On his way thither, in company with his daughter, he\r\nunluckily fell into the hands of a party of Welsh insurgents, who\r\nplundered him of all his books and papers, but these were afterwards to\r\na great extent recovered by the exertions of the clergy and gentry of\r\nthe country. In 1646 Usher came to London, and found a home in the house\r\nof his friend the Dowager Countess of Peterborough, which was situated\r\nin St. Martin's Lane, 'just over against Charing Cross.' From the roof\r\nof the building he witnessed the preliminaries of the execution of\r\nCharles I., but he nearly fainted when 'the villains in vizards began to\r\nput up the king's hair,' and had to be removed. Usher was appointed\r\nPreacher to the Society of Lincoln's Inn in 1647, and for nearly eight\r\nyears preached regularly during term-time in the chapel. He had a suite\r\nof furnished apartments provided for him in the Inn, 'with divers rooms\r\nfor his library.' He retired in 1656 to Lady Peterborough's house at\r\nReigate in Surrey, and died there on the 21st of March in that year. On\r\nthe 21st of the following month he was buried in Westminster Abbey; a\r\npublic funeral being given him by order of Cromwell, who is said,\r\nhowever, to have left the relations of the deceased prelate to pay the\r\ngreater part of the expense. Usher formed a large and valuable library\r\nof nearly ten thousand volumes, which cost him many thousand pounds. Dr.\r\nRichard Parr, his biographer, states that 'after he became archbishop he\r\nlaid out a great deal of money in books, laying aside every year a\r\nconsiderable sum for that end, and especially for the procuring of\r\nmanuscripts, as well as from foreign parts, as near at hand.' His\r\nlibrary contained a number of rare Oriental manuscripts, which he\r\nobtained through the instrumentality of Mr. Thomas Davis, a merchant at\r\nAleppo. Among them were a copy of the Samaritan Pentateuch, a Syrian\r\nPentateuch, and a Commentary on a great part of the Old and New\r\nTestaments. From the Samaritan Pentateuch Usher furnished some extracts\r\nfor his friend Selden's _Marmora Arundeliana_, and he deposited the\r\nmanuscript itself in the Cottonian Library. Dr. Walton also found\r\nUsher's collection of much use in preparing his Polyglot Bible. Several\r\nof the manuscripts which had belonged to Usher were given to the\r\nBodleian Library by James Tyrrell, the historian, who was the\r\nArchbishop's grandson. It was Usher's intention to have left his library\r\nto Trinity College, but having lost all his other property he thought it\r\nright to bequeath it to his daughter, Lady Tyrrell, who had a large\r\nfamily. After his death it was offered for sale, and the King of Denmark\r\nand Cardinal Mazarin were both anxious to acquire it; but Cromwell,\r\nconsidering it disgraceful to his administration to allow such a\r\nsplendid collection of books to be sent out of the kingdom, prohibited\r\nthe disposal of it without his consent, and it was purchased for the sum\r\nof two thousand two hundred pounds, the money being principally\r\ncontributed by the officers and soldiers of the army in Ireland. It is\r\nsaid that the amount paid for it was much less than what had been\r\npreviously offered. The books were sent to Dublin and placed in the\r\nCastle, with a view that they should form the library of a new College\r\nor Hall then projected. They remained in the Castle until the\r\nRestoration, when Charles II., in accordance with Usher's first\r\nintention, gave them to Trinity College, where they are still preserved.\r\nUsher, who is said by Selden to have been 'ad miraculum doctus,' was the\r\nauthor of many works, some of the more important being _Immanuel, or\r\nthe Mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God_ (Dublin, 1638), 4to;\r\n_Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates et Primordia_ (Dublin, 1639),\r\n4to; _Annales Veteris et Novi Testamenti_ (London, 1650-54), folio[34];\r\n_De Graeca Septuaginta Interpretum Versione Syntagma_ (London, 1654),\r\n4to; and _Chronologia Sacra_ (London, 1660), 4to. A complete edition of\r\nthe Archbishop's works, in seventeen octavo volumes, partly edited by\r\nDr. C.R. Elrington, and partly by Dr. J.H. Todd, with an index volume by\r\nDr. W. Reeves, was published in Dublin in 1847-64.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Life of Usher, by Dr. C.R.

He was first educated at\r\nthe public school at Ruthin, and later at St. John's College, Cambridge,\r\nwhere he was sent when sixteen years of age. While at the university he\r\nappears to have indulged in a somewhat reckless expenditure, and Bishop\r\nHacket, who wrote his biography, informs us that 'from a youth and so\r\nupward he had not a fist to hold money, for he did not lay out, but\r\nscatter, spending all that he had, and somewhat for which he could be\r\ntrusted.' He was, however, by no means neglectful of his studies, for we\r\nare told by Lloyd in his _State Worthies_, 'that unwearied was his\r\nindustry, unexpressible his capacity: He never saw the book of worth he\r\nread not; he never forgot what he read; he never lost the use of what he\r\nremembered: Everything he heard or saw was his own; and what was his own\r\nhe knew how to use to the utmost.' From the time of Williams's\r\nordination in 1609, his career until the accession of Charles I. was a\r\nremarkably rapid and successful one. After holding one or two livings,\r\nhe was appointed Chaplain to the King and Sub-Dean of Salisbury, and in\r\n1620 Dean of Westminster. On the fall of Bacon, in July 1621, in whose\r\nruin he had taken a large share, he was sworn in as Lord Keeper. Lloyd\r\nobserves with reference to the manner in which he fulfilled the duties\r\nof this post, that 'the lawyers despised him at first, but the judges\r\nadmired him at last.' Williams was also made Bishop of Lincoln, and\r\nallowed to retain the deanery of Westminster and the rectory of\r\nWalgrave; in fact the number of preferments he held was so large that\r\nDr. Heylyn remarks that 'he was a perfect diocese within himself, as\r\nbeing bishop, dean, prebend, residentiary, and parson, all at once.'\r\nWilliams held the post of Lord Keeper until 1626, when he was deprived\r\nof his office, and various charges, including one of betraying the\r\nKing's secrets, were brought against him by Archbishop Laud, his great\r\nenemy. He was found guilty of subornation of perjury in defending\r\nhimself from these charges, suspended from all his dignities and\r\nappointments, condemned to suffer imprisonment during the pleasure of\r\nthe King, and fined ten thousand pounds. Lloyd says 'he suffered for\r\nconniving at Puritans, out of hatred to Bishop Laud; and for favouring\r\nPapists, out of love to them.' At the meeting of the Long Parliament\r\nWilliams was released, and having been again received into favour at\r\ncourt, he was translated in 1641 to the Archbishopric of York. During\r\nthe Civil War he retired to his estate at Aber-Conway, and for some time\r\nheld Conway Castle for the King. He died of a quinsy on the 25th of\r\nMarch 1650, and was interred in Llandegay church, where a monument was\r\nerected to his memory by his nephew and heir Sir Griffyth Williams.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Williams was a generous patron of learning, and Lloyd states\r\nthat 'his pensions to Scholars were more numerous than all the Bishops\r\nand Noble-mens besides'; and that he imposed 'Rent-charges on all the\r\nBenefices in his Gift as Lord Keeper, or Bishop of Lincoln, to maintain\r\nhopeful youth.' He formed a library in his palace at Buckden in\r\nHuntingdonshire, which was dispersed or destroyed during his\r\nimprisonment,[35] but upon his release he collected another, which he\r\nbequeathed to St. John's College, Cambridge, having previously given\r\nupwards of two thousand pounds to the college for the purpose of\r\nbuilding a new library; and in Bagford and Oldys's _London Libraries_ we\r\nfind an account of the books which he gave to the library of Westminster\r\nAbbey. 'In the great cloister of the abbey,' they write, 'is a\r\nwell-furnished library, considering the time when it was erected by Dr.\r\nWilliams, Dean of Westminster and Bishop of Lincoln; who was a great\r\npromoter of learning. He purchased the books of the heirs of one Baker\r\nof Highgate, and founded it for public use every day in Term, from nine\r\nto twelve in the forenoon, and from two till four in the afternoon. The\r\nMSS. are kept in the inner part, but by an accident many of them were\r\nburnt.' Mr. James Yeowell, the editor of the work, adds in a note that\r\n'Dean Williams converted a waste room, situate in the east side of the\r\ncloisters, into a library, which he enriched with the valuable works\r\nfrom the collection of Sir Richard Baker, author of _The Chronicles of\r\nthe Kings of England_, which cost him 500_l._ A catalogue of this\r\nlibrary is in Harl. MS. 694. There is also a MS. catalogue, compiled in\r\n1798 by Dr. Dakin, the precentor, arranged alphabetically.'\r\n\r\nA portrait of Archbishop Williams is hung in the library of St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: The chronology given in this work is still the standard\r\nadopted in editions of the English Bible.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: 'After this, hearing his Majesty would not abate anything\r\nof his fine, he desired that it might be taken up by 1000_l._ yearly as\r\nhis estate would bear it, till the whole should be paid. But that was\r\nnot granted: Kilvert [the solicitor for the prosecution] was ordered to\r\ngo to Bugden and Lincoln, and there to seize upon all he could and bring\r\nit into the Exchequer. Kilvert, glad of the office, made sure of all\r\nthat could be found, goods of all sorts, plate, books, etc. to the value\r\nof 10,000_l._, of which he never gave account but of 800_l._ The timber\r\nhe felled, killed the deer in the park, sold an organ which cost 120_l._\r\nfor 10_l._, pictures which cost 400_l._ for 4_l._, made away with what\r\nbooks he pleased, and continued revelling for three summers in\r\nBugden-house. For four cellars of wine, cyder, ale, and beer, with wood,\r\nhay, corn, and the like, stored up for a year or two, he gives no\r\naccount at all; and thus a large personal estate was squandered away,\r\nand not the least part of the King's fine paid all this while, whereas\r\nif it had been managed to the best advantage, it would have been\r\nsufficient to have discharged the whole.'--_Biographia Britannica_, vol.\r\nvi. p. 4288 (note).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN SELDEN, 1584-1654\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Selden, the distinguished legal antiquary, historian, and Oriental\r\nscholar, who was styled by his friend Ben Jonson 'a monarch in letters,'\r\nand 'vir omni eruditionis genere instructissimus' by Archbishop Laud,\r\nwas born on the 16th of December 1584 at Salvington, near Worthing, in\r\nSussex. His father was John Selden, a farmer, known as the 'Minstrel' on\r\naccount of his proficiency in music. Aubrey describes him as 'a\r\nyeomanly man of about forty pounds a year, who played well on the\r\nviolin, in which he took much delight.' Selden was first educated at the\r\nfree grammar school at Chichester, and afterwards proceeded with an\r\nexhibition to Hart Hall, since merged in Magdalen Hall, Oxford. On\r\nleaving the university he was admitted a member of Clifford's Inn; but\r\nin 1604 removed to the Inner Temple. Wood, in his _Athenae Oxonienses_,\r\nsays of him that 'after he had continued there a sedulous student for\r\nsome time, he did, by the help of a strong body and a vast memory, not\r\nonly run through the whole body of the law, but became a prodigy in most\r\nparts of learning, especially in those which were not common or little\r\nfrequented or regarded by the generality of students of his time. So\r\nthat in a few years his name was wonderfully advanced not only at home\r\nbut in foreign countries, and he was usually styled the great dictator\r\nof learning of the English nation.... He was a great philologist,\r\nantiquary, herald, linguist, statesman, and what not.' Selden devoted\r\nhis time rather to chamber practice and to legal researches and the\r\nstudy of history and antiquities than to the more active part of his\r\nprofession. It is said he wrote his first work, _Analecton\r\nAnglo-Britannicon_, as early as 1607, when only twenty-two years of age,\r\nbut it was not published until eight years later. _The Duello_,\r\n_England's Epinomis_, and _Jani Anglorum Facies Altera_ appeared in\r\n1610, _Titles of Honour_ in 1614, _De Diis Syris Syntagmata Duo_ in\r\n1617, and _The History of Tithes_ in 1618, wherein he allows the legal,\r\nbut denies the divine, right of the clergy to the receiving of tithes.\r\nThe more important of his later works are _Marmora Arundeliana_,\r\npublished in 1628, _De Successionibus_ in 1631, _Mare Clausum_ in 1635,\r\n_De Jure Naturali et Gentium juxta Disciplinam Ebraeorum Libri VII_. in\r\n1640, and _Fleta, seu Commentarius Juris Anglicani_, an ancient\r\nmanuscript which he edited and annotated, in 1647. Among his other\r\nliterary labours are the notes appended to Drayton's _Polyolbion_. A\r\nvolume of his _Table Talk_ was published after his death in 1689, and\r\nhis complete works in 1726, in three volumes folio. In 1621 Selden was\r\ncommitted to prison for having advised the House of Commons to assert\r\nits right to offer advice to the Crown, but was released after an\r\nimprisonment of five weeks. He first entered the House of Commons in\r\n1623 as Member for Lancaster, and for some years took a very prominent\r\npart in its proceedings. During the later disputes between Charles and\r\nthe Parliament he acted with great moderation, and it is said that at\r\none time the King thought of intrusting him with the Great Seal. Selden\r\nsubscribed the Covenant in 1643, and was made Keeper of the Rolls and\r\nRecords in the Tower. In 1645 he was appointed a Commissioner of the\r\nAdmiralty, and in the same year he was elected Master of Trinity Hall,\r\nCambridge, an office he declined to accept. Parliament voted him five\r\nthousand pounds in 1647 as compensation for his sufferings during the\r\nmonarchy; but Wood states that 'some there are that say that he refused\r\nand could not out of conscience take it, and add that his mind was as\r\ngreat as his learning, full of generosity and harbouring nothing that\r\nseemed base.' Although he remained in Parliament after the execution of\r\nthe King, he almost entirely withdrew from public affairs, and, it is\r\nsaid, refused to write a reply to the _Eikon Basilike_ when requested to\r\ndo so by Cromwell. Selden died on November 30, 1654, at Friary House,\r\nWhitefriars, the residence of Elizabeth, Countess Dowager of Kent, to\r\nwhom it was reputed he had been married. He was interred in the Temple\r\nChurch, where a monument was erected to his memory.\r\n\r\nSelden collected a very fine library, 'rich in classics and science,\r\ntheology and history, law and Hebrew literature,' of which about eight\r\nthousand volumes were eventually added to the Bodleian Library. Selden\r\nhad bequeathed his books to the Bodleian; but it is said he was so\r\noffended with the University for refusing the loan of a manuscript\r\nexcept upon a bond for one thousand pounds, that he revoked the\r\nbequest, and left them to the free disposal of his executors. They\r\noffered the collection to the Society of the Inner Temple, but as no\r\nbuilding was provided for its reception, they carried out the original\r\nintention of Selden, and gave it in 1659 to the Bodleian, stipulating at\r\nthe same time that all the books should be chained, and L25, 10s. was\r\nexpended for that purpose. There is no doubt, however, that a\r\nconsiderable number of the manuscripts came into the possession of that\r\nlibrary soon after Selden's death, and the entire affair is involved in\r\nsome obscurity. The Rev. W.D. Macray, who, in his _Annals of the\r\nBodleian Library_, goes very fully into the matter, gives another reason\r\nfor Selden's displeasure. 'In July 1649,' he writes, 'the new intruded\r\nofficers and fellows of Magdalene College found in the Muniment-room in\r\nthe cloister-tower of the College a large sum of money in the old\r\ncoinage called Spur-royals, or Ryals, amounting to L1400, the equivalent\r\nof which had been left by the Founder as a reserve-fund for law\r\nexpenses, for re-erecting or repairing buildings destroyed by fire,\r\netc., or for other extraordinary charges. This gold had been laid up and\r\ncounted in Queen Elizabeth's time, and had remained untouched since\r\nthen; consequently, although some of the old members of the College were\r\naware of its existence, to the new-comers it seemed a welcome and\r\nunexpected discovery, especially as the College was at the time heavily\r\nin debt. They immediately proceeded to divide it among all the members\r\non the foundation proportionately, not excluding the choristers (who\r\nwere at that time undergraduates), the Puritan President, Wilkinson,\r\nbeing alone opposed to such an illegal proceeding, and being with\r\ndifficulty prevailed upon to accept L100 as his share, which, however,\r\nupon his death-bed he charged his executors to repay. The Spur-royals\r\nwere exchanged at the rate of 18s. 6d. to 20s. each, and each fellow had\r\nthirty-three of them. But when the fact of this embezzlement of\r\ncorporate funds became known, the College was called to account by\r\nParliament, and, although they attempted to defend themselves, they\r\nindividually deemed it wise to refund the greater, or a considerable,\r\npart of what had been abstracted. Fuller, whose _Church History_ was\r\npublished in the year following Selden's death, after telling this\r\nscandalous story, proceeds thus (Book IX. p. 234):--\"Sure I am, a great\r\nantiquarie lately deceased (rich as well in his state as learning) at\r\nthe hearing thereof quitted all his intention of benefaction to Oxford\r\nor any place else.\" ... And Wood (_Hist. and Antiq._, by Gutch, ii. 942)\r\nsays that he had been told that this misappropriation was one reason of\r\nSelden's distaste at Oxford.'\r\n\r\nBesides the books sent to the Bodleian Library, those relating to law\r\nwere given to Lincoln's Inn, and some medical works were bequeathed by\r\nSelden to the College of Physicians. 'Eight chests full of registers of\r\nabbeys, and other manuscripts relating to the history of England,' were\r\nunfortunately destroyed in a fire at the Temple; and many volumes also\r\nwere lost during the interval between Selden's death and their arrival\r\nat Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HOWARD, EARL OF NORFOLK, 1586-1646\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most zealous and successful collectors of the early part of\r\nthe seventeenth century was Thomas Howard, only son of Philip, Earl of\r\nArundel, and grandson of Thomas, Duke of Norfolk, who was beheaded in\r\n1572. He was born on the 7th of July 1586. In 1595 his father died in\r\nthe Tower, and by his attainder his son was deprived of his titles and\r\nlands. On the accession of James I. the former were restored to him, but\r\nthe King retained the property. Lord Arundel was created Earl of Norfolk\r\nin 1644, and died at Padua on the 4th of October 1646.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMS OF THOMAS HOWARD, EARL OF NORFOLK.]\r\n\r\nAfter his death his collections were partially dispersed; and in 1666\r\nhis printed books were presented, at the instigation of John Evelyn, to\r\nthe Royal Society by Henry Howard, afterwards sixth Duke of Norfolk, a\r\ngrandson of the Earl, while the manuscripts were divided between that\r\nSociety and the College of Arms. In 1831 the principal portion of the\r\nmanuscripts in possession of the Royal Society were transferred to the\r\nBritish Museum, and the remainder, consisting of Oriental manuscripts,\r\nin 1835. They were valued at three thousand five hundred and fifty-nine\r\npounds, and were paid for partly in money, and partly with duplicates of\r\nprinted books in the Museum collection. A large portion of the Earl's\r\nlibrary consisted of the books of Bilibaldus Pirckheimer of Nuremberg,\r\nwhich he acquired during a diplomatic mission into Germany in 1636. Some\r\nof the manuscripts, Oldys states, once formed part of the library of\r\nMatthias Corvinus, King of Hungary. The Earl of Norfolk's collections\r\nalso comprised a very large number of antique marbles, paintings, vases,\r\nand gems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD SMITH, 1590-1675\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Smith or Smyth, who was born in 1590 at Lillingston Dayrell,\r\nBuckinghamshire, was the son of the Rev. Richard Smith of Abingdon,\r\nBerkshire. He was sent to the University of Oxford, but did not\r\nmatriculate, and after a short stay there was removed by his parents,\r\nand articled to a solicitor of the city of London. In 1644 he became\r\nSecondary of the Poultry Compter, which was worth about seven hundred\r\npounds a year. This office he held until the death of his eldest son\r\nJohn in 1655, when he sold it, and 'betook himself,' says Anthony a\r\nWood, 'wholly to a private life, two-thirds of which he at least spent\r\nin his library.' He died on the 26th of March 1675, and was buried in\r\nthe Church of St. Giles, Cripplegate, where a monument was erected to\r\nhis memory.\r\n\r\nSmith was an indefatigable collector, and amassed a library of very fine\r\nand rare books, many of which had belonged to an earlier collector,\r\nHumphrey Dyson. These books came to Smith by marriage.[36] Wood informs\r\nus that 'he was constantly known every day to walk his rounds among the\r\nbooksellers' shops (especially in Little Britain) in London, and by his\r\ngreat skill and experience he made choice of such books that were not\r\nobvious to every man's eye.' 'He lived in times,' Wood adds, 'which\r\nministred peculiar opportunities of meeting with books that were not\r\nevery day brought into public light: and few eminent libraries were\r\nbought where he had not the liberty to pick and choose.... He was also a\r\ngreat collector of MSS., whether ancient or modern that were not extant,\r\nand delighted much to be poring on them.' Wood also states that after\r\nSmith's death, 'there was a design to buy his choice library for a\r\npublic use, by a collection of moneys to be raised among generous\r\npersons, but the work being public, and therefore but little forwarded,\r\nit came into the hands of Richard Chiswell, a bookseller living in S.\r\nPaul's Ch.-yard, London: who printing a catalogue of, with others added\r\nto, them, which came out after Mr. Smith's death, they were exposed to\r\nsale by way of auction, to the great reluctancy of public-spirited men,\r\nin May and June 1682.' The sale, which commenced on the 15th of May, and\r\nwas continued day by day the first five days of every week until all the\r\nbooks were sold, took place at 'the Auction House known by the name of\r\nthe Swan in Great Bartholomew's Close.' It realised one thousand four\r\nhundred and fourteen pounds, twelve shillings and eleven pence.[37] A\r\ncopy of the catalogue, with the prices in manuscript, is preserved in\r\nthe British Museum. The sums obtained for the Caxtons, of which there\r\nwere about a dozen, will be interesting to bibliographers. A copy of\r\n_Godfrey of Bulloyn_, which it is stated had belonged to King Edward\r\nIV., fetched the highest price--eighteen shillings; and the _Game of the\r\nChesse_, the _History of Jason_, and the _Eneydos of Virgil_ sold\r\nrespectively for thirteen shillings, five shillings and a penny, and\r\nthree shillings; while no more than two shillings could be got for the\r\n_Book of Good Manners_. A fine copy of the Coverdale Bible realised only\r\ntwenty shillings and sixpence, and Captain John Smith's _History of\r\nVirginia_ went for seven shillings and twopence. The manuscripts also,\r\neven for those days, sold at exceedingly low prices.\r\n\r\nA very interesting account of the library will be found in an article on\r\nEnglish Book-Sales, 1681-86, by Mr. A.W. Pollard, in vol. ii. of\r\n_Bibliographica_. Mr. Smith wrote some learned works which he left in\r\nmanuscript. _A Letter to Dr. Henry Hammond, concerning the Sense of that\r\nArticle in the Creed, He descended into Hell_, written by Smith in 1659,\r\nwas printed in 1684; and his _Obituary, being a catalogue of all such\r\npersons as he knew in their life; extending from A.D. 1627 to A.D.\r\n1674_, was edited for the Camden Society by Sir H. Ellis, K.H., in 1849.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of the _Obituary_, together with the manuscripts of two\r\nor three other works by Smith are preserved among the Sloane Manuscripts\r\nin the British Museum. A portrait of him was engraved by William\r\nSherwin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Hearne in his _Diary_ (Oct. 4, 1714) states: 'That Mr.\r\nRich. Smith's rare and curious collection of books was began first by\r\nMr. Humphrey Dyson, a public notary, living in the Poultry. They came to\r\nMr. Smith by marriage. This is the same Humphrey Dyson that assisted\r\nHowes in his continuation of _Stowe's Survey of London_, ed. folio;' and\r\nin his preface to Peter Langtoft's _Chronicle_ (vol. i. p. xiii.) Hearne\r\ndescribes Dyson as 'a person of a very strange, prying, and inquisitive\r\ngenius in the matter of books, as may appear from many Libraries; there\r\nbeing Books (chiefly in old English) almost in every Library, that have\r\nbelong'd to him, with his name upon them.' Some of his books are\r\npreserved in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: In an entry in his _Diary_ (Sep. 4, 1715) Hearne\r\nsays:--'Mr. Richard Smith's Catalogue that is printed contains a very\r\nnoble and very extraordinary collection of books. It was begun first in\r\nthe time of King Hen. VIII., and comeing to Mr. Smith, he was so very\r\ndiligent and exact in continueing and improving, that hardly anything\r\ncurious escaped him.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE THOMASON, _died_ 1666\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Thomason, who formed the wonderful collection of Civil War\r\ntracts, which was given to the British Museum by King George III., was\r\nborn at the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Nothing appears to be known of his parents. He took up his\r\nfreedom as a member of the Stationers' Company on the 5th of June\r\n1626.[38] His first publication was a new edition of Martyn's _History\r\nof the Kings of England_, which he produced in conjunction with James\r\nBoler and Robert Young in 1628, and he continued to publish books until\r\n1660. He carried on business at the Rose and Crown, St. Paul's\r\nChurchyard, and we learn from the _Obituary_ of Richard Smith that he\r\ndied on April 10, 1666, and was 'buried out of Stationers' Hall (a poore\r\nman).' The Rev. George Thomason, who was Canon of Lincoln from 1683 to\r\n1712, is stated to have been his eldest son.\r\n\r\nThe number of separate printed tracts in the collection which Thomason\r\nformed with such unwearied perseverance for twenty years is stated in an\r\nAccount of it,[39] printed about 1680, to consist of 'near Thirty\r\nThousand several sorts,' together with 'near one hundred several MS.\r\npieces that were never printed, all, or most of them on the King's\r\nbehalf, which no man durst then venture to publish without endangering\r\nhis Ruine,' and it is said that these were contained in 'above Two\r\nThousand bound Volumes.' Mr. Falconer Madan, however, in his admirable\r\npaper on the Thomason Tracts in _Bibliographica_,[40] informs us that\r\nafter going carefully through the collection, and looking at every\r\ntitle-page, he has come to the conclusion that the present number of\r\nseparate pieces is twenty-two thousand seven hundred and sixty-one in\r\nprint, and seventy-three in manuscript, comprised in about one thousand\r\nnine hundred and eighty-three volumes.\r\n\r\nAll the tracts are arranged in chronological order, and from July 1642\r\nto the end of the collection Thomason has placed the date of issue on\r\nevery piece when it is not printed on it, and has also endeavoured to\r\nsupply the place of printing when not given. These notes are sometimes\r\nsupplemented by others commenting on the opinions of the authors of the\r\ntracts. There is a manuscript catalogue in twelve folio volumes,\r\ncompiled by Marmaduke Foster, and annotated and corrected by Thomason\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe collection is not confined to tracts relating to the Civil War and\r\nthe Commonwealth; it also contains many works on other subjects. Among\r\nthese is a fine copy of the first edition of Walton's _Compleat Angler_,\r\nwhich at the present time would realise nearly, if not quite, as large a\r\nsum as the amount (three hundred pounds) given by King George III. for\r\nthe entire series.\r\n\r\nThe collection, which was commenced by Thomason in 1640, and continued\r\nuntil 1661, was made by him under great difficulties. He was a staunch\r\nRoyalist, and the books appear to have been in constant danger of\r\nfalling into the hands of the Parliamentary army. We read in the Account\r\nto which we have already referred that 'to prevent the Discovery of\r\nthem, when the Army was Northwards, he pack'd them up in several\r\nTrunks, and by one or two in a week sent them to a trusty Friend in\r\nSurry, who safely preserv'd them; and when the Army was Westward, and\r\nfearing their Return that way, they were sent to London again; but the\r\nCollector durst not keep them, but sent them into Essex, and so\r\naccording as they lay near Danger, still, by timely removing them, at a\r\ngreat charge, secur'd them, but continu'd perfecting the Work.\r\n\r\n'And for a further Security to them, there was a Bargain pretended to be\r\nmade with the University of Oxford and a Receipt of a Thousand Pounds\r\ngiven and acknowledg'd to be in part for them, that if the Usurper had\r\nfound them out, the University should claim them, who had greater Power\r\nto struggle for them than a private Man.\r\n\r\n'All these Shifts have been made, and Difficulties encounter'd to keep\r\nthe Collection from being embezel'd and destroy'd; which with the great\r\nCharges of collecting and binding them, cost the Undertaker so much that\r\nhe refused Four Thousand Pounds for them in his Life time, supposing\r\nthat Sum not sufficient to reimburse him.'\r\n\r\nAnd in another account, at one time prefixed to the catalogue of the\r\ncollection, it is stated that 'not thinking them safe anywhere in\r\nEngland, he at last took a resolution to send them into Holland for\r\ntheir more safe preservation. But considering with himself what a\r\ntreasure it was, upon second thoughts, he durst not venture them at sea,\r\nbut resolved to place them in his warehouses in form of tables round\r\nabout the rooms covered over with canvas, continuing still without any\r\nintermission his going on; nay, even then, when by the Usurper's power\r\nand command he was taken out of his bed, and clapt up close prisoner at\r\nWhitehall for seven weeks' space and above,[41] he still hoping and\r\nlooking for that day, which, thanks be to God, is now come, and there is\r\nput a period to that unparallelled labour, charge and pains he had been\r\nat.\r\n\r\n'Oxford's Library Keeper[42] (that then was) was in hand with them,\r\nabout them a long time, and did hope the Publick Library might compass\r\nthem; but that could not be then effected, it rising to so great a sum\r\nas had been expended on them for so long a time together.'\r\n\r\nAfter Thomason's death a trust was appointed under his will to take\r\ncharge of the tracts, and one of the trustees, Dr. Thomas Barlow,\r\nBodley's librarian from 1652 to 1660, afterwards Bishop of Lincoln, had\r\nthem for a long time in his custody, as appears from a letter addressed\r\nby him to the Rev. George Thomason, the son of the collector, dated\r\nOxon, February 6, 1676. He mentions in the letter that he had\r\nendeavoured to secure them for the Bodleian Library, and that although\r\nhe had hitherto failed, he still did not despair of finding a way to do\r\nso. He was not, however, successful in his efforts, and King Charles II.\r\nappears to have directed Samuel Mearn, the royal stationer and\r\nbookbinder, to buy them on his account; it is not known for what sum. It\r\nis to be presumed, however, that the King did not find the money for\r\nthem, for on May 15, 1684, the Privy Council considered and granted a\r\npetition from Anne Mearn, widow of Samuel Mearn, that she might dispose\r\nof the tracts by sale. She does not seem to have succeeded in doing\r\nthis, and they appear to have been returned to the Thomason family, for\r\nin the year 1745 we find them in possession of Mr. Henry Sisson, a\r\ndruggist in Ludgate Street, London, who, Richard Gough, the antiquary,\r\nwas informed, was a descendant of the collector.[43] After some\r\nnegotiations with the Duke of Chandos for their purchase, they were\r\nbrought by Thomas Hollis[44] to the notice of King George III., who,\r\nthrough the Earl of Bute, bought them of Miss Sisson in 1761 for the sum\r\nof three hundred pounds, and in the following year they were presented\r\nby him to the British Museum.\r\n\r\nOn one of the volumes of the collection are some mud stains, which have\r\nan interesting history. The volume was borrowed from Thomason by King\r\nCharles I., who was anxious to read one of the tracts in it, and while\r\njourneying to the Isle of Wight let it fall in the dirt. Thomason made a\r\nmemorandum of the circumstance on a fly-leaf of the book, adding the\r\n'volume hath the marke of honor upon it, which noe other volume in my\r\ncollection hath.'\r\n\r\nIn 1647 Thomason published a trade catalogue in quarto, consisting of\r\nfifty-eight closely printed pages, entitled _Catalogus Librorum diversis\r\nItaliae locis emptorum Anno Dom. 1647, a Georgio Thomasono Bibliopola\r\nLondinensi apud quem in Caemiterio D. Pauli ad insigne Rosae Coronatae\r\nprostant venales. Londini, Typis Johannis Legatt_, 1647, and in 1648 a\r\nselection of works in oriental languages from this catalogue was\r\npurchased by order of the House of Commons,[45] who directed that the\r\nsum of five hundred pounds out of the receipts at Goldsmiths' Hall\r\nshould be paid for the books, in order that they might be bestowed upon\r\nthe Public Library at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nMr. A.W. Pollard, in a note to Mr. Madan's article in _Bibliographica_,\r\nstates that Thomason had great difficulty in getting the money for\r\nthese books: 'On March 28th, 1648,' he tells us, 'the five hundred\r\npounds was ordered to be paid from the arrears of the two months'\r\nassessments for the Scots army before Newark; on Sep. 25th it was\r\ncharged on the composition of Colonel Humphrey Matthews; and on Nov.\r\n16th, Thomason, being still unpaid, was consoled by interest at the rate\r\nof eight per cent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Arber, _Transcript of the Register_, vol. iii. p. 686.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Copies are preserved in the British Museum and the\r\nBodleian Library, and it is reprinted in Beloe's _Anecdotes_ vol. ii. p.\r\n248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Vol. iii. p. 304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Thomason was implicated in Christopher Love's plot against\r\nthe Commonwealth.

He was the son of Paul D'Ewes of Milden, Suffolk, and Cecilia,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Richard Simonds of Coxden, Chardstock,\r\nDorsetshire. In 1618 he was sent to St. John's College, Cambridge, but\r\nleft in 1620, and entered at the Middle Temple, being called to the Bar\r\nin 1623. He soon, however, gave up his legal practice, and devoted\r\nhimself to the study of history and antiquities. D'Ewes was made a\r\nknight in 1626, and created a baronet in 1641. He was twice married, and\r\ndied in 1650. The baronetcy became extinct in 1731.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF SIR SYMONDS D'EWES, BART.]\r\n\r\nD'Ewes possessed a very fine collection of manuscripts, which were sold\r\nby his grandson to Sir Robert Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford,\r\nnotwithstanding the injunction of D'Ewes, in his will, that his library\r\nshould not be sold or dispersed. Oldys states that Harley recommended\r\nQueen Anne to purchase the manuscripts for a public library, as the\r\nrichest collection in England next to Sir Robert Cotton's, but that the\r\nQueen said, 'It was no virtue for her, a woman, to prefer as she did\r\narts to arms; but while the blood and honour of the nation was at stake\r\nin her wars, she could not, till she had secured her living subjects an\r\nhonourable peace, bestow their money on dead letters.' 'Whereupon,' adds\r\nOldys, 'the Earl stretched his own purse, and gave six thousand pounds\r\nfor the library.' The manuscripts, together with a list of them, which\r\nis believed to have been made by D'Ewes himself, now form part of the\r\nHarleian Collection in the British Museum. The manuscript of an\r\nAnglo-Saxon Dictionary, compiled by D'Ewes in conjunction with Francis\r\nJunius, and several of his diaries are also preserved there. His great\r\nwork was the _Journals of all the Parliaments during the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth_, which was not published until 1682.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR KENELM DIGBY, 1603-1665\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated scholar and collector, Sir Kenelm Digby, was born at\r\nGayhurst, near Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, in 1603. He was the son\r\nof Sir Everard Digby, who was executed in 1606 for the part he took in\r\nthe Gunpowder Plot. Sir Kenelm, who was the author of several remarkable\r\nworks, is described by Lord Clarendon as a man of 'very extraordinary\r\nperson and presence, with a wonderful graceful behaviour and a flowing\r\ncourtesy and civility.' He was knighted in 1623. Digby possessed a very\r\nfine library, which he formed during his residence in Paris, and he had\r\nmany of the volumes bound there by Le Gascon and other eminent binders.\r\nAn earlier library which he collected is said to have been burnt by the\r\nRoundheads during the Civil War.[46] When he died in 1665, his library,\r\nwhich was still in France, was claimed as the property of the French\r\nking, by virtue of the _droit d'aubaine_, and it is said to have been\r\npurchased for ten thousand crowns by the Earl of Bristol, who died in\r\n1676, and whose books, conjointly with those of another collector, were\r\nsold in London in April 1680. A priced catalogue of the sale is\r\npreserved in the British Museum; and it is stated in it that the books\r\nprincipally belonged 'to the library of the Right Honourable George,\r\nlate Earl of Bristol, a great part of which were the Curiosities\r\ncollected by the learned Sir Kenelme Digby.' It is evident, however,\r\nthat a considerable number of the volumes which belonged to Digby\r\nremained in France, as several are to be found in the Bibliotheque\r\nNationale and other libraries. In a communication to the Library\r\nAssociation of the United Kingdom, M. Leopold Delisle, Director of the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale, gives a list of manuscripts and printed books in\r\nthat library, which were formerly the property of the collector. One\r\nvolume, with a very beautiful binding by Le Gascon, is preserved in the\r\nBibliotheque Mazarine. Sir Kenelm presented to the Bodleian Library a\r\nvaluable collection of manuscripts and printed books which Thomas Allen,\r\nhis former tutor, had bequeathed to him in 1630. He also gave a\r\nconsiderable number of volumes to the library of Harvard College,\r\nCambridge, Mass., and the following notice of the gift occurs in the\r\nworks of Richard Baxter:--\r\n\r\n     'I proposed,' he writes, 'to have given almost all my library to\r\n     Cambridge in New England; but Mr. Thomas Knowles, who knew their\r\n     library, told me that Sir Kenelm Digby had already given them the\r\n     Fathers, Councils and Schoolmen, and that it was Histories and\r\n     Commentators which they wanted. Whereupon I sent them some of my\r\n     Commentators and some Histories, among which were Freherus,\r\n     Renherus, and Pistorius's collections.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF SIR KENELM DIGBY'S BOOK-STAMPS.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this first Harvard library was destroyed by fire in 1764.\r\nAt that time it contained about six thousand volumes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: See Article on English Book-Sales, 1676-1680, by Mr. A.W.\r\nPollard, in _Bibliographica_, vol. i. p. 373.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRALPH SHELDON, 1623-1684\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph Sheldon, who was born on the 1st of August 1623, at Beoley in\r\nWorcestershire, was the eldest son of William Sheldon of Beoley and\r\nElizabeth, daughter of William, second Lord Petre. He was privately\r\neducated, and at the age of nineteen he paid a visit to France and\r\nItaly, and resided at Rome for some time, returning home about 1647,\r\nafter an absence of four years from his native country. Sheldon appears\r\nto have been greatly respected, and Nash, in his _Collections for the\r\nHistory of Worcestershire_, says 'he was a person of such rare worth and\r\nexcellent qualities as deserve particular notice. He was a great patron\r\nof learning and learned men, and well skilled in the history and\r\nantiquities of his country, sparing no money to set up a standing\r\nlibrary at Weston. He was a great friend to Anthony Wood, and left him a\r\nlegacy of L40. He purchased the valuable MSS. of the ingenious Augustine\r\nVincent, Windsor Herald, and Keeper of the records in the Tower, _temp._\r\nCharles I., which at his death he bequeathed to the Heralds' College,\r\nwhere they are still preserved; and allowed John Vincent his son a\r\nyearly pension for many years. He travelled often to Rome, and spent\r\nsome time there to furnish himself with choice books, coins and medals.\r\nIn short, he was of such remarkable integrity, charity and hospitality,\r\nas gained him the universal esteem of all the gentlemen of the county;\r\ninsomuch that he usually went by the name of the Great Sheldon.... And\r\nfor the sufferings which himself and father had undergone in the civil\r\nwars, he was nominated by Charles II. one of the gentlemen of\r\nWarwickshire, who were to have received the honour of the Order of the\r\nRoyal Oak, had it been instituted; his estate being then valued at\r\nL2000 per annum, the largest of any in the county, except that of the\r\nMiddlemores of Edgbaston, which was estimated of the same annual value.'\r\nThe library formed by Sheldon at his manor-house of Weston in the parish\r\nof Long Compton, Warwickshire, was a fine one. Among the printed books\r\nwas a very curious and probably unique copy of the first folio of\r\nShakespeare (now the property of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts), where the\r\nconcluding passages of _Romeo and Juliet_, and the opening passages of\r\n_Troilus and Cressida_, are printed twice over at different parts of the\r\nvolume. This irregularity was discovered by Mr. Sidney Lee, who read a\r\npaper on the subject before the Bibliographical Society on March 21,\r\n1898. The library at Weston was dispersed in 1781.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF RALPH SHELDON.]\r\n\r\nIn commemoration of Sheldon's gifts to Heralds' College, Mr. Ralph\r\nBigland, who was created Blue Mantle in 1757, and died as Garter in\r\n1784, caused a handsome canvas to be painted, on which are emblazoned\r\nSheldon's arms, impaled with those of his wife, accompanied by the\r\nfollowing biographical notice:--'To the Memory of Ralph Sheldon of\r\nBeoley in the County of Worcester, Esquire, a great Benefactor to this\r\nOffice. Who died at his Manor-House of Weston in the Parish of\r\nLong-Compton, in the County of Warwick, on Midsu[~m]er Day, 1684, aged\r\n61 years wanting 6 weeks: the Day afterwards his Heart and Bowels were\r\nburied in Long-Compton Chancel, in a Vault by those of his Father,\r\nMother, Grandfather, etc., and on the 10th of July following, his Body\r\nin a Vault by his Ancestors under our Lady's Chapel, Joyning on the\r\nNorth Side to St. Leonard's Church of Beoley: He married\r\nHenrietta-Maria, Daughter of Thomas Savage, Viscount Rock-Savage by\r\nElizabeth his wife, Daughter of Thomas, Lord Darcy, of Chich in Essex,\r\nViscount Colchester and Earl Rivers, but by her had no issue.'\r\n\r\nThis canvas is still preserved in Heralds' College.\r\n\r\nSheldon compiled _A Catalogue of the Nobility of England since the\r\nNorman Conquest, according to theire severall Creations by every\r\nparticular King_, with the arms handsomely emblazoned. This manuscript\r\ncame into the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps, and formed one of the\r\nlots at the sale of his collection in June 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. FRANCIS BERNARD, 1627-1698\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Francis Bernard was born in 1627. He was a Fellow of the College of\r\nPhysicians, Assistant-Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and\r\nPhysician-in-Ordinary to King James II. He died on the 9th of February\r\n1698, and was buried in the parish church of St. Botolph, London, where\r\nhis wife erected a monument to his memory.\r\n\r\nDr. Bernard formed a very extensive library, which consisted, 'more\r\nespecially of that sort of Books which are out of the Common Course,\r\nwhich a Man may make the Business of his Life to collect, and at last\r\nnot be able to accomplish.'[47] It was very rich in works relating to\r\nmedicine, and it also contained a considerable number of early English\r\nbooks, among which were about a dozen Caxtons. The collection was sold\r\nby auction shortly after Bernard's death. The title-page of the sale\r\ncatalogue reads:--'A Catalogue of the Library of the late learned Dr.\r\nFrancis Bernard, Fellow of the College of Physicians, and Physician to\r\nS. Bartholomew's Hospital. Being a large Collection of the best\r\nTheological, Historical, Philological, Medicinal and Mathematical\r\nAuthors, in the Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Dutch\r\nand English Tongues, in all Volumes, which will be sold by Auction at\r\nthe Doctor's late Dwelling House in Little Britain; the Sale to begin on\r\nTuesday, Octob. 4, 1698.' A copy of the catalogue, with the prices in\r\nmanuscript, is in the British Museum. The sale consisted of nearly\r\nfifteen thousand lots and thirty-nine bundles of tracts, which realised\r\nnineteen hundred and twenty pounds; the expenses of the sale amounting\r\nto three hundred and twenty pounds. The Caxtons sold for a little over\r\ntwo guineas. _The Dictes or Sayings of the Philosophers_ and the _Knight\r\nof the Tower_ each fetched five shillings and fourpence, the _History of\r\nJason_ three shillings and sixpence, the _Histories of King Arthur_ two\r\nshillings and tenpence, the _Chastising of God's Children_ one shilling\r\nand tenpence, and the second edition of the _Game of the Chesse_ one\r\nshilling and sixpence.\r\n\r\nDibdin says that Dr. Bernard was 'a stoic in bibliography. Neither\r\nbeautiful binding, nor amplitude of margin, ever delighted his eye or\r\nrejoiced his heart: for he was a stiff, hard, and straightforward\r\nreader--and learned, in Literary History, beyond all his\r\ncontemporaries'; and in the preface to the sale catalogue we read that\r\nhe was 'a person who collected books for use, and not for ostentation or\r\nornament, and he seemed no more solicitous about _their_ dress than _his\r\nown_.' A memorandum book containing notes of his visits to patients,\r\netc., is in the Sloane collection of manuscripts in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Address to the reader, prefixed to sale catalogue.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL PEPYS, 1633-1703\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys, Secretary to the Admiralty in the reigns of King Charles\r\nII. and King James II., was born either at London or Brampton in\r\nHuntingdonshire on the 23rd of February 1633.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-PLATE OF SAMUEL PEPYS.]\r\n\r\nHis father, John Pepys, was a citizen of London, where he followed the\r\ntrade of a tailor, but in 1661 retired to Brampton, at which place he\r\nhad inherited a property of eighty pounds a year from his eldest brother\r\nRobert Pepys. He died there in 1680. Samuel Pepys received his early\r\neducation at Huntingdon, and afterwards at St. Paul's School, London,\r\nwhere he continued until 1650, in which year he was admitted at Trinity\r\nHall, Cambridge. On the 5th of March 1651 he migrated as a sizar to\r\nMagdalene College, Cambridge, where he is entered in the books of the\r\nCollege as 'Samuel Peapys,' and where, two years later, he was elected\r\nto a scholarship founded by John Smith. He graduated B.A. in 1653 and\r\nM.A. in 1660. In 1659 he accompanied his relative, Sir Edward Montagu,\r\nafterwards Earl of Sandwich, on his expedition to the Sound, and on his\r\nreturn became a clerk in the office of Sir G. Downing, one of the\r\nTellers of the Exchequer. In 1660 he was appointed Clerk of the Acts of\r\nthe Navy, which post he held until 1673, when he was made Secretary for\r\nthe Affairs of the Navy, and in 1684 he became Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty, an office he retained until the accession of William and\r\nMary, when he lost his public appointments, and retired into private\r\nlife. Pepys was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665, and in\r\n1684 became President. He died at Clapham on the 26th of May 1703, and\r\nwas buried in the church of St. Olave, Hart Street, London.\r\n\r\nPepys collected a very interesting library, which is now preserved in a\r\nfireproof room in Magdalene College, Cambridge. It consists of about\r\nthree thousand volumes arranged in eleven mahogany cases in the precise\r\norder in which Pepys left them. The cases are the identical ones\r\nmentioned in his _Diary_, August 24, 1666:--'Up and dispatched several\r\nbusinesses at home in the morning, and then comes Sympson to set up my\r\nother new presses for my books, and so he and I fell in to the\r\nfurnishing of my new closett, and taking out the things out of my old,\r\nand I kept him with me all day, and he dined with me, and so all the\r\nafternoon till it was quite dark hanging things, that is my maps and\r\npictures and draughts, and setting up my books, and as much as we could\r\ndo, to my most extraordinary satisfaction; so I think it will be as\r\nnoble a closet as any man hath, and light enough--though indeed it would\r\nbe better to have a little more light.'\r\n\r\nThis room, Mr. Wheatley tells us in his excellent account of the library\r\nin vol. i. of _Bibliographica_, 'was at the Navy Office in Crutched\r\nFriars, and the illustration in the ordinary editions of the _Diary_\r\nshows the position of the cases when they were transferred to the house\r\nin York Buildings (now Buckingham Street, Strand).' 'The presses,' he\r\nadds, 'are handsomely carved, and have handles fixed at each end; the\r\ndoors are formed of little panes of glass, and in the lower divisions\r\nthe glass windows are made to lift up. The books are all arranged in\r\ndouble rows; but by the ingenious plan of placing small books in front\r\nof large ones, the letterings of all can be seen. Neatness was a mania\r\nwith Pepys, and the volumes were evened on all the shelves; in one\r\ninstance some short volumes have been raised to the required height by\r\nhelp of wooden stilts, gilt in front.'\r\n\r\nThe library consists principally of ordinary books, but it also\r\ncomprises some valuable manuscripts, and many volumes from the presses\r\nof the early English printers. It contains as many as nine Caxtons,\r\neight Pynsons, and nineteen Wynkyn de Wordes, several of the last being\r\nunique. The books printed by Caxton are the _Game of the Chesse,\r\nPolychronicon, Chronicles of England, Description of Britain, Mirrour of\r\nthe World, Book of the Order of Chivalry_, the first and second editions\r\nof the _Canterbury Tales_, and the _Chastising of God's Children_. Among\r\nthe most interesting collections is one of eighteen hundred ballads in\r\nfive folio volumes; and another of four duodecimo volumes of garlands\r\nand other popular publications, printed for the most part in black\r\nletter. The volumes are lettered: Vol. 1 _Penny Merriments_, Vol. 2\r\n_Penny Witticisms_, Vol. 3 _Penny Compliments_, and Vol. 4 _Penny\r\nGodlinesses_. In the first volume of the ballads Pepys has written:--'My\r\ncollection of ballads, begun by Mr. Selden, improv'd by the addition of\r\nmany pieces elder thereto in time; and the whole continued to the year\r\n1700.' The library also possesses collections of old novels, pieces of\r\nwit, chivalry, etc, plays, books on shorthand, tracts on the Popish\r\nPlot, liturgical controversies, sea tracts, news-pamphlets, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF SAMUEL PEPYS.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting manuscripts are the famous _Diary_ in six volumes,\r\nthe papers collected by Pepys for his proposed _Navalia_, and a\r\ncollection of Scottish poetry, formed by Sir Richard Maitland of\r\nLethington, Lord Privy Seal and Judge in the Court of Session, who died\r\nin 1586. The drawings and prints in the library are numerous and\r\nvaluable. Among them are portraits of Pepys's friends, and prints and\r\ndrawings illustrating the city of London; one of the rarest of these is\r\nthe large plan of London attributed to Agas, of which only one other\r\ncopy is known. The library also contains some volumes of music with the\r\ntitle, _Songs and other Compositions, Light, Grave and Sacred, for a\r\nsingle voice adjusted to the particular compass of mine; with a thorough\r\nbase on ye ghitarr by Cesare Morelli_. Several songs composed by Pepys\r\nare in this collection, one of which, entitled _Beauty Retire_, was a\r\ngreat success, and the composer was very proud of it. All the books in\r\nthe library are in excellent condition, and, with the exception of a few\r\nin morocco or vellum, are bound in calf. Almost all of them bear Pepys's\r\narms on the lower cover; while on the upper is found a shield with the\r\ninscription, SAM. PEPYS CAR. ET IAC. ANGL. REGIB. A SECRETIS ADMIRALIAE.\r\nThis shield is surmounted with his helmet and crest, and is surrounded\r\nby mantling, in which are introduced two anchors, indicating his office.\r\nHe also used three bookplates--one with his arms, quartering Talbot of\r\nCottenham; a second with his portrait by Robert White, with his motto,\r\n_Mens cujusque is est Quisque_, from the _Somnium Scipionis_ of Cicero;\r\nand a third bearing his initials, with two anchors crossed, together\r\nwith his motto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF SAMUEL PEPYS.]\r\n\r\nPepys left his library, together with his other property, to his nephew,\r\nJohn Jackson; but in a paper of directions respecting it, preserved\r\namong the Harleian Manuscripts in the British Museum, he expresses a\r\ndesire that at his nephew's death it should be placed in either Trinity\r\nor Magdalene College, Cambridge, preferably 'in the latter, for the sake\r\nof my own and my nephew's education therein.' In addition to Pepys'\r\ncollection at Magdalene College, the Bodleian Library contains a series\r\nof his miscellaneous papers in twenty-five volumes, together with\r\nnumerous other volumes which belonged to him, including many curious\r\ndockyard account-books of the times of King Henry VIII. and Queen\r\nElizabeth.[48] These were bequeathed to the library by Dr. Richard\r\nRawlinson, the nonjuring bishop. Mr. John Eliot Hodgkin, F.S.A., of\r\nChildwall, Weybridge, Surrey, also possesses some papers which once\r\nbelonged to Pepys.\r\n\r\nPepys published _Memoirs relating to the State of the Royal Navy of\r\nEngland for ten years determined December 1688_, in 1690; and a work\r\nentitled _The Portugal History: or a Relation of the Troubles that\r\nhappened in the Court of Portugal in the years 1667 and 1668 ... by\r\nS.P., Esq._, printed at London in 1677, is also attributed to him. His\r\nwell-known _Diary_, the manuscript of which fills six small volumes of\r\nclosely written shorthand, was first deciphered by the Rev. John Smith,\r\nRector of Baldock, Hertfordshire, and was published, with a selection\r\nfrom his private correspondence, by Lord Braybrooke, in two volumes in\r\n1825. It has since been several times reprinted. The last edition,\r\nedited by Mr. H.B. Wheatley, F.S.A., published in eight volumes octavo\r\nin 1893-96, contains the whole of the _Diary_, with the exception of\r\npassages which cannot possibly be printed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD STILLINGFLEET, BISHOP OF WORCESTER, 1635-1699\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Stillingfleet, Bishop of Worcester, was the seventh son of Samuel\r\nStillingfleet of the family of Stillingfleet of Stillingfleet,\r\nYorkshire. He was born at Cranborne in Dorsetshire on the 17th of April\r\n1635, and received his early education in the grammar schools of\r\nCranborne and Ringwood. In his fifteenth year he was admitted into St.\r\nJohn's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a Fellowship in 1653. For\r\nseveral years after leaving college he was engaged as a private tutor,\r\nfirst in the family of Sir Roger Burgoyne of Wroxall in Warwickshire,\r\nand afterwards in that of the Hon. Francis Pierrepoint of Nottingham,\r\nduring which period he was ordained by Ralph Brownrig, the deprived\r\nBishop of Exeter. In 1657 he was presented by Sir R. Burgoyne to the\r\nrectory of Sutton, Bedfordshire, and in 1665 the Earl of Southampton\r\ngave him the rectory of St. Andrew's, Holborn. He was also appointed\r\nPreacher at the Rolls Chapel, and shortly afterwards Reader of the\r\nTemple, and Chaplain in Ordinary to Charles II. In 1667 he was collated\r\nto a Canonry in St. Paul's, London; in 1669 he became a Canon 'in the\r\ntwelfth prebend' in Canterbury Cathedral; in 1677 Archdeacon of London;\r\nin 1678 Dean of St. Paul's; and on the 13th of October 1689 he was\r\nconsecrated Bishop of Worcester. He died at his residence in Park\r\nStreet, Westminster, on the 27th of March 1699, and was buried in\r\nWorcester Cathedral, where a monument was erected to his memory by his\r\nson, with a Latin epitaph by Richard Bentley, who had been one of his\r\nchaplains.\r\n\r\nBishop Stillingfleet collected 'at a vast expence of time, pains and\r\nmoney' a very choice and valuable library, which contained a\r\nconsiderable number of manuscripts, and upwards of nine thousand five\r\nhundred printed volumes, besides many pamphlets. It is stated that there\r\nwere over two thousand folios in it, and that it cost the Bishop six\r\nthousand pounds. Evelyn in a letter to Pepys, dated August 12th, 1689,\r\nwrites: 'The Bishop of Ely[49] has a well stor'd library; but the very\r\nbest is what Dr. Stillingfleete, Deane of St. Paule's, has at Twicknam,\r\nten miles out of towne.' After Stillingfleet's death his library was\r\noffered for sale. Entries in Evelyn's diary[50] show that great efforts\r\nwere made to persuade William III. to buy it, but they evidently failed,\r\nas the historical manuscripts were purchased by Robert Harley\r\n(afterwards Earl of Oxford), while the remainder of the collection was\r\nacquired by Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop of Armagh, who bought the books\r\nfor a public library in Dublin which he had founded. He is said to have\r\npaid two thousand five hundred pounds for them. Stillingfleet, who on\r\naccount of his handsome person was nicknamed 'the beauty of holiness,'\r\nwas the author of _Origines Britannicae, or Antiquities of the British\r\nChurches_, and many controversial works. His collected works were\r\nprinted in 1710 in six volumes folio, and a volume of his miscellaneous\r\nworks was published in 1735 by his son, the Rev. James Stillingfleet,\r\nCanon of Worcester.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: John Moore, Bishop of Ely, whose library was purchased by\r\nKing George I., and presented by him to the University of Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: '_April 29, 1699._--I dined with the Archbishop, but my\r\nbusiness was to get him to persuade the King to purchase the late Bishop\r\nof Worcester's library, and build a place, for his own library at St.\r\nJames's, in the Parke, the present one being too small.'\r\n\r\n'_May 3, 1699._--At a meeting of the Royal Society I was nominated to be\r\nof the Committee to wait on the Lord Chancellor to move the King to\r\npurchase Bp. of Worcester's library.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MOORE, BISHOP OF ELY, 1646-1714\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Moore, Bishop successively of Norwich and Ely, who was born at\r\nSutton-juxta-Broughton, Leicestershire, in 1646, was the eldest son of\r\nThomas Moore, an ironmonger at Market Harborough. He was educated at the\r\nFree School, Market Harborough, and at Clare College, Cambridge, where\r\nhe obtained a fellowship in 1667. Having taken holy orders, he was\r\ncollated in 1676 to the rectory of Blaby in Leicestershire; and in 1679,\r\nthrough the influence of Heneage Finch, Earl of Nottingham, who, in\r\n1670, had appointed him his chaplain, he was installed canon in Ely\r\nCathedral. In 1687 he was presented by the dean and chapter of St.\r\nPaul's to the rectory of St. Austin, London, and in 1689 he obtained the\r\nrectory of St. Andrew's, Holborn, which he held with his canonry at Ely\r\nuntil 1691, when he was consecrated Bishop of Norwich. He remained in\r\nthat see until 1707, in which year he was translated to the more\r\nvaluable bishopric of Ely. Moore died on the 31st of July 1714, from the\r\neffects of a cold which he caught while presiding at the trial of Dr.\r\nBentley, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, who was charged with\r\nencroaching on the privileges of the fellows of that institution. He\r\nwas buried in Ely Cathedral, where a monument was erected to his memory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-PLATE PLACED IN BOOKS FROM BISHOP MOORE'S LIBRARY\r\nGIVEN BY GEORGE I. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE.]\r\n\r\nBishop Moore, who is called by Dibdin 'the father of black-letter\r\ncollectors in this country,' was a great and generous patron of\r\nlearning, and formed a magnificent library, which at the time of his\r\ndeath contained nearly twenty-nine thousand printed books and seventeen\r\nhundred and ninety manuscripts. John Bagford was the principal assistant\r\nin its collection, and in return for his services the Bishop procured\r\nhim a place in the Charterhouse. The library, which was kept in the\r\nepiscopal residence in Ely Place, Holborn, where it occupied 'eight\r\nchambers,' is mentioned in _Notices of London Libraries_, by John\r\nBagford and William Oldys, where it is stated that 'Dr. John Moore, the\r\nlate Bishop of Ely, had also a prodigious collection of books, written\r\nas well as printed on vellum, some very ancient, others finely\r\nilluminated. He had a _Capgrave's Chronicle_, books of the first\r\nprinting at Mentz, and other places abroad, as also at Oxford, St.\r\nAlban's, Westminster, etc.' John Evelyn, Bishop Burnet, and Ralph\r\nThoresby also write in terms of high praise of the excellence and great\r\nextent of the collection. Richard Gough, the antiquary, states that 'the\r\nBishop formed his library by plundering those of the clergy in his\r\ndiocese. Some he paid with sermons or more modern books; others only\r\nwith quid illiterati cum libris'; but there appears to be little, if\r\nany, truth in this accusation. Moore, who was anxious that his library\r\nshould not be dispersed after his death, offered it, in 1714, to Robert\r\nHarley, Earl of Oxford, for the sum of eight thousand pounds; but the\r\nnegotiation failed in consequence, it is said, of the Bishop 'insisting\r\non being paid the money in his lifetime, though Lord Oxford was not to\r\nhave the books till the Bishop's death.' After Moore's decease the\r\ncollection was sold for six thousand guineas to George I., who gave it,\r\non the suggestion of Lord Townsend, to the University of Cambridge. A\r\nspecial book-plate, designed and engraved by John Pine, was placed in\r\nthe volumes. At the same time that the king sent these books to the\r\nUniversity he despatched a troop of horse to Oxford, which occasioned\r\nthe two well-known epigrams attributed to Dr. Tripp and Sir William\r\nBrowne--\r\n\r\n  'Contrary methods justly George applies\r\n  To govern his two universities,\r\n  To Oxford sent a troop of horse;--for why?\r\n  That learned body wanted Loyalty.\r\n  To Cambridge he sent books, as well discerning,\r\n  How much that loyal body wanted learning.'\r\n\r\nThe reply by Sir W. Browne runs--\r\n\r\n  'Contrary methods justly George applies\r\n  To govern his two universities,\r\n  And so to Oxford sent a troop of horse,\r\n  For Tories hold no argument but force;\r\n  To Cambridge Ely's learned books are sent,\r\n  For Whigs admit no force but argument.'\r\n\r\nThis is not the only version of these epigrams, but the Rev. Cecil Moore\r\nin his Memoir of the Bishop considers it to be the correct one.\r\n\r\nMoore's diaries, letters, and private accounts are also preserved in the\r\nCambridge University Library. A volume containing his printed sermons\r\nwas published in 1715, and a second issue in two volumes in 1724. Both\r\nseries were edited by the Rev. Samuel Clarke, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BAGFORD, 1650?-1716\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Bagford was born about 1650. The exact date of his birth is\r\nunknown, and he does not appear to have been acquainted with it himself,\r\nfor a short time before his death he informed Mr. James Sotheby that he\r\nwas either sixty-five or sixty-six years of age, he could not tell\r\nwhich. According to the belief of Thomas Hearne, the antiquary, he was\r\nborn in Fetter Lane, London, and he was no doubt for some time a\r\nshoemaker, for in a very curious and entertaining little treatise on the\r\n_Art of Shoemaking and Historical Account of Clouthing of ye foot_,\r\nwhich is believed to have been written by him, and is now preserved\r\namong the Harleian manuscripts in the British Museum, the writer states\r\nthat he was brought up to the 'craft of shoemaking.' This trade,\r\nhowever, he soon abandoned for a more congenial occupation, and he\r\nbecame a collector of books on commission for booksellers and amateurs.\r\nIn pursuance of this work he made several journeys to the Continent, and\r\nacquired a great knowledge of books, prints, and literary curiosities.\r\nHe was specially employed by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, Sir Hans\r\nSloane, and John Moore, Bishop of Ely, who appear to have greatly\r\nappreciated his judgment, diligence, and honesty; and the last-named\r\ncollector procured him, as some recompense for his services, admission\r\ninto the Charterhouse. Nothing is known of Bagford's parents, and little\r\nof his domestic life, but he appears to have been married, for on the\r\nback of a leaf in one of the volumes of his collections we find the\r\nfollowing memorandum in Bagford's writing: 'John, son of John and\r\nElizabeth Bagford, was baptized 31st October 1675, in the parish of St.\r\nAnne, Blackfriars.' This son seems to have become a sailor in the Royal\r\nNavy, for in another volume in the same collections there is a power of\r\nattorney, dated April 6, 1713, signed by John Bagford, Junior,\r\nempowering his 'honoured father, John Bagford, Senior, of the parish of\r\nSt. Sepulchre, in the county of Middlesex, bookseller,' to claim and\r\nreceive from the Paymaster of Her Majesty's Navy his wages as a seaman\r\nin case of his death. Bagford, who took great interest in all\r\ndescriptions of antiquities, was one of the little group of\r\ndistinguished men who reconstituted in 1707 the Society of Antiquaries.\r\nHe died, Dr. Birch informs us, at Islington on the 15th of May 1716, and\r\nwas buried in the graveyard belonging to the Charterhouse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BAGFORD.]\r\n\r\nDuring his researches for his employers Bagford amassed two great\r\ncollections: one consisting of ballads, now known as the 'Bagford\r\nBallads'; the other being a vast collection of leaves from manuscripts,\r\ntitle-pages and fragments of books, specimens of paper, book-plates,\r\nengravings, bindings, catalogues, advertisements, and various\r\ninteresting and curious pieces. With the aid of these materials Bagford\r\nintended to write a history of printing, and in 1707 he published his\r\n_Proposals for an Historical Account of that most universally celebrated\r\nas well as useful Art of Typography_. The work, which was also to\r\ncontain a history of bookbinding, paper-making, etc., was, however,\r\nnever published, and it has been often stated that Bagford was quite\r\nincompetent to carry out such an undertaking. This may possibly have\r\nbeen the case, for although he was certainly a man of much ability, and\r\npossessed an extensive knowledge of books, he had received but little\r\neducation. Several of his contemporaries, however, held a different\r\nopinion, and among them Hearne, who repeatedly expresses in his works\r\nhis admiration of both Bagford's genius and his collections.\r\n\r\nThe method of compiling a history of printing from a collection of\r\ntitle-pages appears to be both a clumsy and a costly one, but it seems\r\nprobable from entries in the diary of Oldys, and from Gough's memoir of\r\nAmes, that that bibliographer wrote his _Typographical Antiquities_ with\r\nthe aid of similar materials.\r\n\r\nBagford has been subjected to very severe censure for mutilating books\r\nfor the purpose of forming his collection of title-pages. Mr. Blades, in\r\nhis work _The Enemies of Books_, accuses him of being 'a wicked old\r\nbiblioclast who went about the country, from library to library, tearing\r\naway title-pages from rare books of all sizes'; and Dr. Dibdin in\r\n_Bibliomania_ states that he 'was the most hungry and rapacious of all\r\nbook and print collectors.' The testimony of Hearne (who knew Bagford\r\nwell, and who was also amply qualified to judge both of his merits and\r\ndemerits), however, is very different. He writes: 'It was very laudable\r\nin my Friend, Mr. John Bagford (who I think was born in Fetter Lane,\r\nLondon), to employ so much of his time, as he did, in collecting Remains\r\nof Antiquity. Indeed he was a man of very surprising genius, and had his\r\neducation (for he was first a shoemaker, and afterwards for some time a\r\nbookseller) been equal to his natural genius, he would have proved a\r\nmuch greater man than he was. And yet, without this education, he was,\r\ncertainly, the greatest man in the world in his way.... 'Tis very\r\nremarkable, that, in collecting, his care did not extend itself to Books\r\nand to the fragments of Books, only, but even to the very Covers, and to\r\nthe Bosses and Clasps; and all this, that he might, with the greater\r\nease, compile the History of Printing, which he had undertaken, but did\r\nnot finish. In this noble Work he intended a Discourse about Binding,...\r\nand another about the Art of making paper, in both of which his\r\nobservations were very accurate.'\r\n\r\nA great number of the title-pages and fragments collected by Bagford are\r\nevidently taken from books which could be purchased in his day for a few\r\nshillings, many of them probably for a few pence; while it is possible\r\nthat some may have been salvage from the Great Fire of 1666, when we\r\nknow immense quantities of books were burnt or damaged. The collections,\r\nit is true, contain fragments of the Gutenberg Bible, various Caxtons,\r\nand other rare books, but there is no reason to think that these were\r\nabstracted from complete copies; it is much more likely that they were\r\nodd leaves which Bagford had picked up, while the leather stains on some\r\nof the most valuable show that they once formed part of the padding of\r\nold bindings. Many of the books were probably acquired by Bagford when\r\nhe took part in the book-hunting expeditions of the Duke of Devonshire,\r\nthe Earls of Oxford, Sunderland, and other collectors, who amused\r\nthemselves every Saturday during the winter in rambling through various\r\nquarters of the town in search of additions to their libraries. After\r\nBagford's death Hearne was very anxious to obtain his collections, as he\r\nwished to publish 'a book from them, for the service of the public, and\r\nthe honour of Mr. Bagford,' but much to his chagrin he was forestalled\r\nby Wanley, Lord Oxford's librarian, who acquired them for his employer's\r\nlibrary, and they formed part of the Harleian Manuscripts, etc.,\r\npurchased in 1753 for the British Museum. Wanley, however, does not\r\nappear to have secured the whole of Bagford's papers, as the Sloane\r\ncollection contains four volumes of manuscripts and printed matter\r\nwhich belonged to him, and the Bodleian Library possesses some\r\nIndulgences which he acquired and gave to Hearne.\r\n\r\nThe Bagford collections in the British Museum consist of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine[51] volumes, including three of ballads. The manuscript\r\npieces are contained in thirty-six folios; the printed pieces in\r\nsixty-three folios, twenty-one quartos, and nine octavos. Among the more\r\nimportant manuscripts are Bagford's Commonplace Book; his Book of\r\nAccounts; his Account of Public and Private Libraries; Collections in\r\nreference to Printing; Names of old English Printers, with lists of the\r\nworks which passed through their hands; an Account of Paper; Patents\r\ngranted to Printers in England; Observations on the History of Printing;\r\nLives of famous Engravers, etc. The collection also contains a large\r\nnumber of fragments of early Bibles, Service Books, Decretals, Lives of\r\nSaints, etc. These are almost entirely of vellum, and some of them are\r\nas early as the eighth century.\r\n\r\nAmong the printed fragments is a leaf from the Gutenberg Bible,[52]\r\nportions of the _Recuyell of the Histories of Troy_, the\r\n_Polychronicon_, the _Book of Fame_, and many other books from the\r\npresses of Caxton, Machlinia, Rood and Hunte, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde,\r\nand other early printers, both English and foreign.\r\n\r\nThe maps in the collection are especially important and interesting,\r\nincluding a very rare one sometimes found in Hakluyt's _Navigations and\r\nDiscoveries of the English Nation_, printed in the years 1599 and 1600,\r\nand worth at least two hundred pounds;[53] and the even more valuable\r\ncelestial and terrestrial planispheres by John Blagrave of Reading,\r\nwhich are believed to be unique. There are also some rare documents\r\nrelating to the Post Office; a number of early book-plates; some fine\r\nspecimens of English, French, and German stamped bindings of the\r\nsixteenth century; several volumes of Chinese, marbled, and other\r\npapers; early almanacks; a quantity of engravings of towns, costumes,\r\ntrades, furniture, etc.; curious advertisements of tobacco, tea, quack\r\nmedicines, etc.; specimens of fine writing; and many other miscellaneous\r\npapers of much interest.\r\n\r\nBagford was the author of a letter on the antiquities of London,\r\nprefixed to the first volume of Hearne's edition of Leland's\r\n_Collectanea_; and also of an _Account of London Libraries_, first\r\nprinted in 1708 in _The Monthly Miscellany, or Memoirs for the\r\nCurious_. This little brochure was continued by Oldys, and the complete\r\nwork published by Mr. James Yeowell in 1862. _The Essay on the Invention\r\nof Printing, by Mr. John Bagford_, in vol. XXV. of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society_, was, Dibdin says, drawn up by\r\nWanley. The collection of ballads has been edited by the Rev. J.W.\r\nEbsworth for the Ballad Society.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: It is somewhat doubtful whether a few of these belonged to\r\nBagford.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Probably given to Bagford by Michael Maittaire, the\r\ncollector, who possessed a very imperfect copy of the Gutenberg Bible,\r\nwhich sold for fifty shillings at the sale of his library.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: This is believed to be the map alluded to by Shakespeare\r\nin Act. iii. Sc. 2 of _Twelfth Night_, where he makes Maria say of\r\nMalvolio: 'He does smile his face into more lines than there are in the\r\nnew map, with the augmentation of the Indies.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HERBERT, EIGHTH EARL OF PEMBROKE, 1656-1733\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Herbert, eighth Earl of Pembroke, who was born in 1656, was the\r\nthird son of Philip, the fifth Earl. By the deaths of his elder\r\nbrothers, the sixth and seventh Earls, he succeeded to the title in\r\n1683, and from that time to his death in 1733 he held many of the\r\nhighest appointments in the State. He was one of the representatives of\r\nEngland at the treaty of Ryswick, and he carried the Sword of Justice at\r\nthe coronations of William and Mary, Anne, George I. and George II. He\r\nwas also President of the Royal Society in 1689-90.\r\n\r\nMany of the Earls of Pembroke were men of culture and patrons of\r\nlearning. In 1629 William, the third Earl, gave to the University of\r\nOxford, of which he was Chancellor, a very valuable series of Greek\r\nmanuscripts collected by Giacomo Barocci, a gentleman of Venice; and in\r\n1649 his brother Philip, the fourth Earl, gave to the same University,\r\nof which he was also Chancellor, a splendidly bound copy of the Paris\r\nPolyglot Bible, printed in 1645 in nine volumes. These two brothers are\r\n'the incomparable pair of brethren' to whom the first folio of\r\nShakespeare is dedicated. There had been for several generations a\r\nlibrary at Wilton House, Salisbury, which Dibdin considered to be one of\r\nthe oldest of private collections existing; but Thomas, the eighth Earl,\r\nadded to it so large a number of rare books that it 'entitled him to\r\ndispute the palm even with the Lords Sunderland and Oxford.' Maittaire,\r\nin his _Annales Typographici_, calls the library a 'Bibliotheca\r\nexquisitissima,' and styles its owner 'Humanitatis politioris cultor et\r\npatronus.' Dibdin also states that Lord Pembroke spared no expense for\r\nbooks, and that he was 'a collector of everything the most precious and\r\nrare in the book-way.' The library was still further augmented by his\r\nsuccessor Henry.\r\n\r\nDr. Dampier, Bishop of Ely, compiled a list in 1776 of the earlier\r\nprinted works in the library, which Dibdin has reproduced in his\r\n_Decameron_. The books are one hundred and ninety-nine in number, of\r\nwhich one hundred and eighty-eight are of the fifteenth century. The\r\nlist contains eight Caxtons, eighteen volumes printed by Jenson, and\r\nten by the Spiras. Among the most notable of the incunabula are the\r\n_Rationale Divinorum Officiorum_ of Durandus, on vellum, printed by Fust\r\nand Schoeffer at Mentz in 1459; the _Catholicon_ of Balbus, printed at\r\nMentz in 1460; _Cicero de Oratore_, printed by Sweynheym and Pannartz at\r\nthe Monastery of Subiaco in 1465; Cicero's _Epistolae ad Familiares_,\r\nprinted by Joannes de Spira at Venice in 1469; and the _Bokys of Hawkyng\r\nand Huntyng_, printed at St. Albans in 1486. The Caxtons are _The\r\nRecuyell of the Histories of Troy_; the first and second editions of\r\n_The Game of the Chesse_; the first edition of _The Dictes or Sayings of\r\nthe Philosophers_, _Tully of Old Age_, _Chronicles of England_, the\r\n_Polychronicon_, and the _Liber Festivalis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCISSUS LUTTRELL, 1657-1732\r\n\r\n\r\nNarcissus Luttrell, who was born in 1657, was the son of Francis\r\nLuttrell of London, a descendant of the Luttrells of Dunster Castle, in\r\nthe county of Somerset. He received his early education under Mr.\r\nAldrich at Sheen in Surrey, and in 1674 was admitted a fellow-commoner\r\nof St. John's College, Cambridge. In the succeeding year he was created\r\nM.A. by royal mandate.[54] While at the University he presented a\r\nsilver tankard to his college, which was lost, together with a quantity\r\nof other plate, on the 9th of October 1693, for the recovery of which a\r\nreward of ten pounds was offered.[55] Luttrell, who, Dibdin says, was\r\n'ever ardent in his love of past learning, and not less voracious in his\r\nbibliomaniacal appetites,' formed an extensive library at Shaftesbury\r\nHouse, Little Chelsea, where he resided for many years in seclusion.\r\nHearne speaks of it 'as a very extraordinary collection,' and adds that\r\n'in it are many manuscripts, which, however, he had not the spirit to\r\ncommunicate to the world, and 'twas a mortification to him to see the\r\nworld gratified without his assistance.' A special feature of the\r\nlibrary was the large and interesting collection of fugitive pieces\r\nissued during the reigns of Charles II., James II., William III., and\r\nAnne, which Luttrell purchased day by day as they appeared. Sir Walter\r\nScott found this collection, which in his time was chiefly in the\r\npossession of the collectors Mr. Heber and Mr. Bindley, very useful when\r\nediting the _Works_ of Dryden, published in eighteen volumes at London\r\nin 1808. In the preface he remarks that 'the industrious collector seems\r\nto have bought every poetical tract, of whatever merit, which was hawked\r\nthrough the streets in his time, marking carefully the price and date\r\nof purchase. His collection contains the earliest editions of many of\r\nour most excellent poems, bound up, according to the order of time, with\r\nthe lowest trash of Grub Street.' On Luttrell's death, which took place\r\nat his residence in Chelsea on the 27th of June 1732, the collection\r\nbecame the property of Francis Luttrell (presumed to be his son), who\r\ndied in 1740. It afterwards passed into the possession of Mr. Serjeant\r\nWynne, and from him descended to Edward Wynne, his eldest son, the\r\nauthor of _Eunomus, or Dialogues concerning the Law and Constitution of\r\nEngland; and a Miscellany containing several law tracts_, published at\r\nLondon in 1765. He died a bachelor in 1784, and the library, which had\r\nbeen considerably enlarged by its later possessors, was inherited by his\r\nbrother, the Rev. Luttrell Wynne, of All Souls' College, Oxford, by\r\nwhose direction it was sold by auction by Leigh and Sotheby in 1786. The\r\nsale, which consisted of two thousand seven hundred and fifty-six lots,\r\ncommenced on March 6th, and lasted twelve days. It is stated in the\r\ncatalogue that 'great part of the library was formed by an Eminent and\r\nCurious Collector in the last Century, and comprehends a fine Suite of\r\nHistorical, Classical, Mathematical, Natural History, Poetical and\r\nMiscellaneous Books, in all Arts and Sciences ... by the most Eminent\r\nPrinters, Rob. Steph., Morell, Aldus, Elzevir, Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde,\r\n&c. &c. Also a very curious Collection of old English Romances, and old\r\nPoetry; with a great number of scarce Pamphlets during the Great\r\nRebellion and the Protectorate.' Various portions of the Luttrell\r\ncollections were bought by Messrs. Heber and Bindley. The greater part\r\nof those purchased by Mr. Bindley were eventually acquired by the\r\nBritish Museum at the Duke of Buckingham's sale in 1849, while those\r\nwhich belonged to Mr. Heber are now to be found on the shelves of the\r\nBritwell library. Dibdin informs us that 'a great number of poetical\r\ntracts was disposed of, previous to the sale, to Dr. Farmer, who gave\r\nnot more than forty guineas for them.' Two Caxtons in the sale--the\r\n_Mirrour of the World_ and _Caton_--fetched respectively five guineas\r\nand four guineas, and a collection of plays, in twenty-one volumes, by\r\nGascoigne, Dekker, etc., sold for thirty-eight pounds, seventeen\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HANS SLOANE, BART.]\r\n\r\nLuttrell compiled a chronicle of contemporary events, which was\r\nfrequently quoted by Lord Macaulay in his _History of England_. This\r\nremained in manuscript for many years in the library of All Souls'\r\nCollege, Oxford, but in 1857 it was printed in six volumes by the\r\nDelegates of the University Press under the title of _A Brief Historical\r\nRelation of State Affairs from September 1678 to April 1714_. He also\r\nleft a personal diary in English, but whimsically written in Greek\r\ncharacters, consisting principally of entries recording the hours of his\r\nrising and going to bed, the manner in which he spent his time, what\r\nfriends called to see him, the sermons he heard, where and how he dined,\r\nand the occasions, which were not infrequent, when he took too much\r\nwine. This manuscript is preserved in the British Museum (Add. MS.\r\n10447).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: _Notes and Queries._ Second Series.

His father, Alexander Sloane, was a\r\nScotchman, who had settled in Ireland on his appointment to the post of\r\nreceiver-general of the estates of Lord Claneboy, afterwards Earl of\r\nClanricarde.[56] Hans Sloane gave early indications of unusual ability,\r\nand as soon as his health, which was delicate, would permit, he came to\r\nLondon, and devoted himself to the study of medicine, and the kindred\r\nsciences of chemistry and botany. In 1683 he went to Paris, which at\r\nthat time possessed greater facilities for medical education than could\r\nbe found in London. Having taken the degree of Doctor of Medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Orange in July 1683, he made a tour in France, and\r\ntowards the close of the year 1684 he returned to England and settled in\r\nLondon. In 1685 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in\r\n1687 he was admitted a Fellow of the College of Physicians. His love for\r\nscientific research led him to accept the offer of the post of physician\r\nto the Duke of Albemarle, who had been recently appointed\r\nGovernor-General of the West India Colonies. He was also appointed\r\nphysician to the West Indian fleet. He set sail for Jamaica on the 12th\r\nof September 1687, and reached Port Royal on the 19th of December; but\r\nin consequence of the death of the Duke, which took place towards the\r\nend of the following year, Sloane returned to England in May 1689,\r\nbringing with him large collections in all branches of natural history,\r\nwhich he had obtained in Madeira, as well as in Jamaica and other West\r\nIndian islands. In 1693 Sloane was appointed to the Secretaryship of the\r\nRoyal Society, and in 1727 he had the honour of succeeding Sir Isaac\r\nNewton as President. His professional career was a very successful one.\r\nIn 1712 he was made Physician-Extraordinary to Queen Anne, whom he\r\nattended during her last illness; and in 1716 he was created a baronet\r\nby King George I., who also bestowed on him the post of\r\nPhysician-General to the Forces. On the accession of King George II. in\r\n1727 he was appointed First Physician to the King. He was elected\r\nPresident of the College of Physicians in 1719, and held the office till\r\n1735. In 1741 he removed his museum and library from his residence in\r\nGreat Russell Street, Bloomsbury, to the fine old manor-house of\r\nChelsea, which he had purchased from the family of Cheyne. Here he spent\r\nhis time in the society of his friends, and in enriching and arranging\r\nthe treasures he had collected. He died after a short illness on the\r\n11th of January 1753, in the ninety-third year of his age, and was\r\nburied in Chelsea church, where a monument was erected to his memory by\r\nhis daughters. Sir Hans Sloane married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress\r\nof Alderman Langley, and widow of Fulk Rose of Jamaica, by whom he had\r\nfour children, two of whom died young. Sarah, the elder of the two\r\ndaughters who survived their father, married George Stanley of Poultons,\r\nHampshire; the younger, Elizabeth, married Colonel Charles Cadogan,\r\nafterwards second Baron Cadogan.\r\n\r\nA table drawn up by Sloane's trustees immediately after his death shows\r\nthat, in addition to his splendid natural history museum, his\r\ncollections comprised between forty and fifty thousand printed books,\r\nthree thousand five hundred and sixteen manuscripts,[57] and six\r\nhundred and fifty-seven pictures and drawings. The coins and medals\r\namounted to thirty-two thousand, and other antiquities to two thousand\r\nsix hundred and thirty-five. Sir Hans Sloane expressed a desire in his\r\nwill that his collection in all its branches might be kept and preserved\r\ntogether after his decease, and that an application should be made by\r\nhis trustees to Parliament for its purchase for twenty thousand pounds,\r\na sum which did not represent more than a fourth of its real value. This\r\napplication was favourably received, and in June 1753 an Act was passed,\r\n'For the purchase of the Museum, or Collection of Sir Hans Sloane, and\r\nof the Harleian Collection of Manuscripts; and for providing one general\r\nrepository for the better reception and more convenient use of the said\r\nCollections; and of the Cottonian Library, and of the additions\r\nthereto.' The Act further enacted that a board, consisting of forty-two\r\ntrustees, be appointed for putting the same into execution; and at a\r\ngeneral meeting of this body, held at the Cockpit, at Whitehall, on the\r\n3rd of April 1754, it was resolved to accept of a proposal which had\r\nbeen made to them, of the 'Capital Mansion House, called Montague House,\r\nand the freehold ground thereto belonging, for the general repository of\r\nthe British Museum, on the terms of ten thousand pounds.'[58] Although\r\nthe Act had been passed, considerable difficulty was experienced in\r\nfinding the purchase-money. When the matter was brought before George\r\nII. he dismissed it with the remark, 'I don't think there are twenty\r\nthousand pounds in the Treasury'; and eventually it was proposed that\r\nthe needful sum should be raised by a public lottery, which should\r\nconsist of 'a hundred thousand shares, at three pounds a share; that two\r\nhundred thousand pounds should be allotted as prizes, and that the\r\nremaining hundred thousand--less the expenses of the lottery\r\nitself--should be applied to the threefold purposes of the Act, namely,\r\nthe purchase of the Sloane and Harleian Collections; the providing of a\r\nRepository; and the creation of an annual income for future\r\nmaintenance.'[59] Sir Hans Sloane's principal work was the _Natural\r\nHistory of Jamaica_, 2 vols., London, 1707-25, which occupied him for no\r\nless than thirty-eight years.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Edwards, _Lives of Founders of the British Museum_, p.\r\n274.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: There are 4100 volumes of Sloane MSS. in the British\r\nMuseum.

Ayscough, was\r\nprinted in 1782.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: Sims, _Handbook to the Library of the British Museum_, p.\r\n2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER LE NEVE, 1661-1729\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Le Neve was the son of Francis Neve (the _Le_ had been dropped for\r\nseveral generations, when Peter resumed the ancient form of his name), a\r\ncitizen and draper of London. He was born in London in 1661, and was\r\neducated at Merchant Taylors' School. From an early age he displayed a\r\ngreat love of antiquarian pursuits, and in 1707, when the Society of\r\nAntiquaries was reconstituted, he was chosen the first President, which\r\noffice he held until 1724. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. On\r\nthe 17th of January 1690, Le Neve was appointed Rouge-Croix Pursuivant;\r\non April the 5th 1704, Richmond Herald; and on the 25th of the\r\nsucceeding month Norroy King-at-Arms. He died on the 24th of September\r\n1729, and was buried in the chancel of Great Witchingham Church,\r\nNorfolk. Oldys states that Le Neve had 'a vast treasure of Historical\r\nAntiquities, consisting of about 2000 printed books and above 1200 MSS.,\r\ninterspersed with many notes of his own.' Oldys also mentions that 'it\r\nis said that he had some pique with the Heralds' Office a little before\r\nhis death, so cut them off with a single book, otherwise he had left\r\nthem the whole of his library.'[60]\r\n\r\n'Honest Tom Martin of Palgrave,' the antiquary, who was Le Neve's\r\nexecutor, and who married his widow, appears to have succeeded to the\r\nbulk of Le Neve's collections. They were sold by auction in 1731. The\r\ntitle-page of the sale catalogue reads:--'A Catalogue of the valuable\r\nlibrary collected by that truly Laborious Antiquary, Peter Le Neve,\r\nEsq.; Norroy King of Arms (lately deceas'd), containing most of the\r\nBooks relating to the History and Antiquities of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and many other nations.

By John Wilcox, Bookseller in Little Britain.'\r\n\r\nThe sale appears to have lasted about a fortnight, and was followed by a\r\nsmall supplementary one on March the 19th, of 'Some Curiosities and\r\nManuscripts omitted in the previous Catalogue.' A copy of the sale\r\ncatalogue, with the prices and the names of some of the purchasers in\r\nmanuscript, is to be found in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAlthough Le Neve was an ardent collector and compiled a considerable\r\nnumber of works on heraldry and topography, many of which are preserved\r\nin the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, Heralds' College, and the\r\nRecord Office, he does not appear to have printed anything. His list of\r\n_Pedigrees of Knights made by King Charles II., King James II., King\r\nWilliam III. and Queen Mary, King William alone, and Queen Anne_, was\r\nedited by Dr. G.W. Marshall for the Harleian Society in 1873.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Edwards, _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, p.\r\n308.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Memoir of Oldys_, etc. London, 1862, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT HARLEY, FIRST EARL OF OXFORD, 1661-1724\r\n\r\nAND\r\n\r\nEDWARD HARLEY, SECOND EARL OF OXFORD, 1689-1741\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Harley, Earl of Oxford, who was born in Bow Street, Covent\r\nGarden, on the 5th of December 1661, was the eldest son of Sir Edward\r\nHarley, K.B., who was Governor of Dunkirk after the Restoration.\r\nEntering Parliament in 1689, in 1701 he was elected Speaker of the House\r\nof Commons; in 1710 he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in\r\n1711 he was created Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, and made Lord High\r\nTreasurer, from which post he was dismissed in 1714. In 1713 he received\r\nthe Order of the Garter. He was impeached by the House of Commons in\r\n1715; acquitted without being brought to a trial in 1717, and died at\r\nhis house in Albemarle Street, London, on the 21st of May 1724.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE BOOK-PLATES OF ROBERT HARLEY AS A COMMONER.]\r\n\r\nHarley was the greatest collector of his time, and formed a splendid\r\nlibrary, which, at the time of his death, besides the printed books,\r\ncontained more than six thousand volumes of manuscripts, and an immense\r\nnumber of charters, rolls, and deeds. This noble collection was\r\ninherited by Lord Oxford's son Edward, second Earl, by whom it was very\r\nconsiderably augmented in every department; and when he died in June\r\n1741, the volumes of manuscripts amounted to seven thousand six hundred\r\nand thirty-nine volumes, exclusive of fourteen thousand two hundred and\r\nthirty-six original rolls, deeds, charters, and other legal documents.\r\nThe printed books were estimated at about fifty thousand volumes, the\r\npamphlets at about three hundred and fifty thousand, and the prints at\r\nforty-one thousand. In the _Account of London Libraries_, by Bagford and\r\nOldys, it is stated:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT HARLEY'S BOOK-STAMP.]\r\n\r\n'For libraries in more expressly particular hands, the first and most\r\nuniversal in England, must be reckoned the Harleian, or Earl of Oxford's\r\nlibrary, begun by his father and continued by himself. He has the rarest\r\nbooks of all countries, languages, and sciences, and the greatest number\r\nof any collector we ever had, in manuscript as well as in print,\r\nthousands of fragments, some a thousand years old; vellum books, some\r\nwritten over; all things especially respecting English History, personal\r\nas well as local, particular as well as general. He has a great\r\ncollection of Bibles, etc., in all versions, and editions of all the\r\nfirst printed books, classics, and others of our own country,\r\necclesiastical as well as civil, by Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson,\r\nBerthelet, Rastall, Grafton, and the greatest number of pamphlets and\r\nprints of English heads of any other person. Abundance of ledgers,\r\nchartularies, old deeds, charters, patents, grants, covenants,\r\npedigrees, inscriptions, etc., and original letters of eminent persons,\r\nas many as would fill two hundred volumes; all the collections of his\r\nlibrarian Humphrey Wanley, of Stow, Sir Symonds D'Ewes, Prynne, Bishop\r\nStillingfleet, John Bagford, Le Neve, and the flower of a hundred other\r\nlibraries.'\r\n\r\nThe library was remarkably rich in early editions of the Greek and Latin\r\nclassics (there were as many as one hundred and fifteen volumes of\r\nvarious works by Cicero printed in the fifteenth century), English early\r\npoetry and romances, and books of prints, sculpture and drawings. The\r\ncollection of Caxtons was both large and fine, and it comprised the only\r\nperfect copy known of the _Book of the Noble Histories of King Arthur_,\r\nwhich, nearly a century and a half after the dispersion of the Harleian\r\nlibrary, was purchased for nineteen hundred and fifty pounds, at the\r\nsale of the Earl of Jersey's books in 1885, by Mr. Quaritch for a New\r\nYork collector.\r\n\r\nThe volumes in the library were all handsomely bound; mostly in red\r\nmorocco, and tooled with a distinctive kind of ornamentation, which has\r\nsince been known as the Harleian Style. This commonly consisted of a\r\ncentrepiece, generally of a lozenge form, surrounded by a broad and\r\nelegant border. Eliot and Chapman were the binders of the greater\r\nportion of the books, at a cost, it is said, of upwards of eighteen\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nHumphrey Wanley was for several years librarian to both the first and\r\nthe second Earls, and he commenced the compilation of the catalogue of\r\nthe manuscripts, which was finally completed by the Rev. Thomas Hartwell\r\nHorne in 1812. Among the Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Museum is\r\na diary,[61] kept by Wanley, which contains much interesting information\r\nrespecting the library. Some time after Wanley's decease, William Oldys\r\nwas appointed librarian at a salary of two hundred pounds per annum.\r\n\r\nThe second Earl of Oxford had a passion for building and landscape\r\ngardening, as well as for collecting books, paintings and curiosities,\r\nand some years before his death these expensive tastes involved him in\r\npecuniary difficulties. George Vertue, the eminent engraver, in one of\r\nhis commonplace-books, now preserved in the British Museum,[62] thus\r\nfeelingly refers to the embarrassed circumstances of the Earl:--'My good\r\nLord, lately growing heavy and pensive in his affairs, which for some\r\nlate years have mortify'd his mind.... This lately manifestly appeared\r\nin his change of complexion; his face fallen less; his colour and eyes\r\nturned yellow to a great degree; his stomach wasted and gone; and a dead\r\nweight presses continually, without sign of relief, on his mind.'\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this was written Vertue had to lament his loss.\r\n\r\nLord Oxford died in Dover Street, London, on the 16th of June 1741, and\r\non his decease the library became the property of Margaret, Duchess of\r\nPortland, the only daughter and heiress of the Earl, who sold the\r\nprinted books to Mr. Thomas Osborne, the bookseller of Gray's Inn, for\r\nabout thirteen thousand pounds. The manuscripts were purchased by\r\nParliament in 1753 for the sum of ten thousand pounds, and were placed\r\nin the library of the British Museum four years later. The portraits,\r\ncoins, and miscellaneous curiosities were sold by auction in March 1742.\r\n\r\nOsborne bought Lord Oxford's books with a view of disposing of them by\r\nsale, and engaged Dr. Johnson and Oldys to compile a catalogue of them,\r\nwhich was printed in four volumes octavo in the years 1743-44. A fifth\r\nvolume was issued in 1745, but this is nothing more than an enumeration\r\nof Osborne's unsold stock. Osborne also published in eight volumes\r\nquarto, '_The Harleian Miscellany: or, a Collection of Scarce, Curious,\r\nand Entertaining Pamphlets and Tracts_, as well as in Manuscript as in\r\nPrint, found in the late Earl of Oxford's library, interspersed with\r\nHistorical, Political and Critical notes. London 1744-46.' This work,\r\nwhich was edited by Oldys, was republished by Thomas Park in 1808-12,\r\nwith two supplemental volumes. A catalogue of the pamphlets contained in\r\nthe _Harleian Miscellany_ was also prepared by Oldys, and printed in a\r\nquarto volume, which appeared in 1746; and a _Collection of Voyages and\r\nTravels_, compiled from the _Miscellany_, was published in two volumes\r\nfolio in 1745.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Lansdowne MSS. 771, 772.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: Add.

He was appointed Solicitor of the Customs in 1695, a\r\nCommissioner of the Customs in 1711, and in 1715 a Cashier of the\r\nExcise. He was a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn, and a Fellow of the Society\r\nof Antiquaries. He died on the 16th of March 1724.\r\n\r\nBridges, who is mentioned with great respect by Hearne and other\r\nantiquaries, was, says Dibdin, 'a gentleman, a scholar, and a notorious\r\nbook-collector.' His library, which consisted of 'above 4000 Books and\r\nManuscripts in all languages and faculties, particularly in Classics and\r\nHistory, and especially the History and Antiquities of Great Britain and\r\nIreland,'[63] was sold at his chambers, No. 6 Lincoln's Inn, by Mr.\r\nCock, on the 7th of February 1726, and twenty-six following days. The\r\nnumber of lots was four thousand three hundred and thirteen, and the\r\ntotal proceeds of the sale were four thousand one hundred and sixty\r\npounds, twelve shillings. The books sold well, and Hearne, in his\r\n_Diary_, under February 15th, 1726, writes: 'My late friend John Bridges\r\nesqr.'s books being now selling by auction in London (they began to be\r\nsold on Monday the 7th inst.). I hear they go very high, being fair\r\nbooks, in good condition, and most of them finely bound. This afternoon\r\nI was told of a gentleman of All Souls' College, I suppose Dr. Clarke,\r\nthat gave a commission of 8s. for an Homer in 2 vols., a small 8 deg. if not\r\n12 deg.. But it went for six guineas. People are in love with good binding\r\nmore than good reading.' Humphrey Wanley, who was a buyer at the sale\r\nfor Lord Oxford's library, was much dissatisfied with the large sums\r\nwhich the books fetched, and suspected there was a conspiracy to run up\r\nthe prices. He writes in his _Diary_ (February 9, 1725-26): 'Went to Mr.\r\nBridges's chambers, but could not see the three fine MSS. again, the\r\nDoctor his brother having locked them up. He openly bid for his own\r\nbooks, merely to enhance their price, and the auction proves to be, what\r\nI thought it would become, very knavish'; and on the 11th of February he\r\nadds: 'Yesterday at five I met Mr. Noel and tarried long with him; we\r\nsettled then the whole affair touching his bidding for my Lord [Oxford]\r\nat the roguish auction of Mr. Bridges's books. The Reverend Doctor one\r\nof the brothers hath already displayed himself so remarkably as to be\r\nboth hated and despised, and a combination among the booksellers will\r\nsoon be against him and his brother-in-law, a lawyer. These are men of\r\nthe keenest avarice, and their very looks (according to what I am told)\r\ndart out harping-irons. I have ordered Mr. Noel to drop every article in\r\nmy Lord's commissions when they shall be hoisted up to too high a price.\r\nYet I desired that my Lord may have the Russian Bible, which I know full\r\nwell to be a very rare and a very good book.'\r\n\r\nA copy of the sale catalogue, with the prices in manuscript, is\r\npreserved in the library of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nBridges expended several thousand pounds in making collections for his\r\n_History of Northamptonshire_, which, after many delays, was published\r\nunder the editorship of the Rev. Peter Whalley in 1791.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Description of library in sale catalogue.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN MURRAY, 1670-1748\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Murray of Sacombe in Hertfordshire, who was born on the 24th of\r\nJanuary 1670, and died on September 13, 1748, was an indefatigable\r\ncollector of books. In the _Account of London Libraries_, by Bagford and\r\nOldys, we read that he 'made scarce publications of English authors his\r\ninquiry all his life,' and that he had been 'a collector above forty\r\nyears at all sales, auctions, shops, and stalls, partly for his own\r\ncuriosity, and partly to oblige such authors and gentry as have\r\ncommissioned him.' He was a friend of Hearne, who frequently mentions\r\nhim in his works and _Diary_. Hearne states that Murray told him he\r\nbegan to collect books at thirteen years of age. Dr. Rawlinson possessed\r\na painting of him, which was engraved by Vertue. He is leaning on three\r\nbooks, inscribed 'T. Hearne, V. III., Sessions Papers, and Tryals of\r\nWitches,' and holding a fourth under his coat. Underneath are the\r\nfollowing lines, signed G.N.:--\r\n\r\n  'Hoh Maister John Murray of Sacomb!\r\n  The Works of old Time to collect was his pride,\r\n    Till Oblivion dreaded his Care:\r\n  Regardless of Friends, intestate he dy'd,\r\n    So the Rooks and the Crows were his Heir.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MEAD, 1673-1754\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Richard Mead, the eminent physician and collector, was born at\r\nStepney, Middlesex, on the 11th of August 1673. His father, Matthew\r\nMead, was a divine of some eminence among the dissenters, and during the\r\nCommonwealth was minister of Stepney, but was ejected for nonconformity\r\nin 1662. Richard Mead was first educated at home, and at a private\r\nschool kept by Mr. Thomas Singleton, who was at one time second master\r\nat Eton. At the age of sixteen he entered the University of Utrecht,\r\nwhere he remained three years, and then proceeded to the University of\r\nLeyden for the purpose of qualifying himself for the medical profession.\r\nIn 1695 he made a tour in Italy, and after taking the degree of doctor\r\nof philosophy and physic at Padua, he visited Naples and Rome. In 1696\r\nhe returned to England, and began to practise at Stepney, in the house\r\nin which he was born. In 1703 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety, and in the same year he was chosen Physician to St. Thomas's\r\nHospital, and took a house in Crutched Friars, in the City of London,\r\nwhere he resided until 1711, when he removed to one in Austin Friars,\r\nwhich had formerly been inhabited by Dr. Howe. In 1707 the University of\r\nOxford conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Medicine, and in the\r\nfollowing year he was admitted a member of the College of Physicians, of\r\nwhich institution he was elected a Fellow in 1716. On the death of Dr.\r\nRadcliffe in 1714, Mead removed to the residence which had been occupied\r\nby that distinguished physician in Bloomsbury Square, and in 1720 he\r\ntook a house in Great Ormond Street, which he filled with books,\r\npictures and antiquities, and where he lived until his death on the 16th\r\nof January 1754. In 1727 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to King\r\nGeorge II., and in 1734 he was offered the post of President of the\r\nCollege of Physicians, but this he declined, being desirous of\r\nretirement. He was twice married. Dr. Mead was the foremost medical man\r\nof his time, and his professional income was a very large one. The\r\ngreater part of his wealth he devoted to the patronage of science and\r\nliterature, and to the acquisition of his valuable collections, which\r\nwere always open to students who wished to consult them. He had a very\r\nlarge circle of attached friends, amongst whom were Newton, Halley,\r\nPope, Bentley, and Freind; and Dr. Johnson said of him that he 'lived\r\nmore in the broad sunshine of life than almost any other man.' Pope\r\nrefers to his love of books in his epistle to Richard Boyle, Earl of\r\nBurlington, _Of the Use of Riches_:--\r\n\r\n  'Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne alone,\r\n  And books for Mead and butterflies for Sloane.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. MEAD.]\r\n\r\nDr. Mead's library consisted of upwards of ten thousand printed volumes,\r\nand many rare and valuable manuscripts. The collection was especially\r\nrich in medical works, and in early editions of the classics. Among the\r\nlatter were to be found the Spira Virgil of 1470 on vellum, and the 1469\r\nand 1472 editions of the _Historia Naturalis_ of Pliny; the former of\r\nwhich was bought at the sale of his books by the King of France for\r\neleven guineas, and the latter by a bookseller named Willock for\r\neighteen guineas. One of the choicest manuscripts was a missal said to\r\nhave been illuminated by Raphael and his pupils for Claude, wife of\r\nFrancis I., King of France. This was acquired by Horace Walpole for\r\nforty-eight pounds, six shillings. It was bought at the Strawberry Hill\r\nsale in 1842 by Earl Waldegrave for one hundred and fifteen pounds, ten\r\nshillings. The books were generally very fine copies and handsomely\r\nbound. After Mead's death they were sold by auction by Samuel Baker of\r\nCovent Garden, in two parts, and realised five thousand five hundred and\r\neighteen pounds, ten shillings and elevenpence, including nineteen\r\npounds, six shillings and sixpence for fifteen bookcases. The sale of\r\nthe first part commenced on the 18th November 1754, and lasted\r\ntwenty-eight days; that of the second part began on the 7th of April\r\n1755, and lasted twenty-nine days. The pictures, prints and drawings,\r\nantiquities and coins and medals, were sold in the early part of 1755\r\nfor ten thousand five hundred and fifty pounds, eighteen shillings; the\r\npictures fetching three thousand four hundred and seventeen pounds,\r\neleven shillings--about six or seven hundred pounds more than Mead gave\r\nfor them. Some portions of his collections were sold during his\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\nDr. Mead was the author of several medical works, of which his\r\n_Discourse on the Plague_, published in 1720, was the best. The\r\nmagnificent edition of De Thou's _Historia Sui Temporis_, in seven folio\r\nvolumes, London, 1733, edited by Samuel Buckley; and the _Opus Majus_ of\r\nRoger Bacon, London, 1733, edited by Dr. Samuel Jebb, were produced\r\npartly at his expense. Collected editions of his medical works were\r\npublished in London in 1762, and in Edinburgh in 1765. His life has been\r\nwritten by Dr. Maty, the second Principal Librarian of the British\r\nMuseum; and a very interesting account of his library, by Mr. Austin\r\nDobson, will be found in the first volume of _Bibliographica_. A\r\nportrait of him by Allan Ramsay, painted in 1740, is in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery, and a bust of him by Roubillac is preserved in the\r\nCollege of Physicians. His gold-headed cane, given him by Dr. Radcliffe,\r\nis also kept in that institution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARL OF SUNDERLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES SPENCER, THIRD EARL OF SUNDERLAND, 1674-1722\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Spencer, third Earl of Sunderland, who was born in 1674, was the\r\nsecond son of Robert, second Earl, by Anne, daughter of George Digby,\r\nsecond Earl of Bristol. He appears, even when a boy, to have displayed\r\nmuch ability, for as early as 1688, Evelyn, who was on very intimate\r\nterms with the Spencer family, mentions him as 'a youth of extraordinary\r\nhopes, very learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of\r\ngreat merit.' This governor appears to have been Dr. Trimnell,\r\nafterwards Bishop of Winchester. When quite young, Lord Spencer\r\nmanifested a great love for books, and already possessed a considerable\r\ncollection of them, for he was but twenty years of age when Evelyn wrote\r\nto him: 'I was with great appetite coming to take a repast in the noble\r\nlibrary which I hear you have lately purchased.' Evelyn's Diary also\r\ncontains several notices of the collection, and particularly mentions\r\nthe purchase of the books of Sir Charles Scarborough, an eminent\r\nphysician, which were at one time destined for the Royal Library.\r\n\r\nAt the general election in 1695 Lord Spencer was returned both for\r\nTiverton in Devonshire, and for Heydon in Yorkshire. He elected to sit\r\nfor Tiverton, which he represented in Parliament until the death of his\r\nfather in 1702, when he succeeded to the title, his elder brother having\r\ndied in 1688. While a member of the House of Commons he appears to have\r\nheld opinions of a somewhat republican nature; and Swift tells us, 'he\r\nwould often, among his familiar friends, refuse the title of Lord (as he\r\nhad done to myself), swear he would never be called otherwise than\r\nCharles Spencer, and hoped to see the day when there should not be a\r\npeer in England.' These views, however, were very considerably modified\r\non his succession to the title. In 1705 he was appointed envoy\r\nextraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Court of Vienna, to\r\ncongratulate the Emperor Joseph on his accession to the crown. Shortly\r\nafter his return to England, Sunderland, notwithstanding the opposition\r\nof Queen Anne, who always entertained a great antipathy for him, was\r\nmade one of the Secretaries of State, an office which he held until June\r\n1710, when he was dismissed by the Queen, who wished, however, to bestow\r\non him a pension of three thousand pounds a year. This he refused, with\r\nthe remark, 'I am glad your Majesty is satisfied I have done my duty.\r\nBut if I cannot have the honour to serve my country, I will not plunder\r\nit.' He remained out of office during the remainder of Anne's reign,\r\nbut on the accession of George I. to the throne he was made\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland. This post, however, was by no means\r\nagreeable to him, for he regarded it as a kind of banishment, and during\r\nthe short time he held it he never crossed the Channel. In 1715 he was\r\nappointed Lord Privy Seal, Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in 1716, and in\r\nApril 1717 he was a second time made a Secretary of State, his friend\r\nAddison receiving a like appointment. On the 16th of March 1718 he\r\nbecame Lord-President of the Council, and on the 21st of the same month\r\nFirst Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, which office he resigned on the\r\n3rd of April 1721. He died, after a short illness, on the 19th of April\r\n1722.\r\n\r\nLord Sunderland was thrice married, and had children by all his wives.\r\nBy his second wife, Anne, daughter of the great Duke of Marlborough, he\r\nhad four sons and a daughter. The eldest son died in infancy; Robert,\r\nthe second, succeeded to the earldom, and died unmarried on the 15th of\r\nSeptember 1729; Charles, the third, became Earl of Sunderland on the\r\ndeath of his elder brother, and in 1733 second Duke of Marlborough, but\r\nhe did not obtain the Marlborough estates until the demise of the\r\nDowager Duchess in 1744; John, the youngest son, who, by a family\r\narrangement, then succeeded to the Spencer estates, was the father of\r\nthe first Earl Spencer.\r\n\r\nLord Sunderland was a most liberal patron of literature, and the\r\nsplendid library which he commenced in his early youth, and sedulously\r\naugmented till the time of his death, bore witness for several\r\ngenerations to his love of books. This noble collection was kept in his\r\ntown house, which stood between Sackville Street and Burlington House,\r\nwhere it occupied five large rooms, and at the time of the Earl's death\r\nin 1722 consisted of about twenty thousand printed volumes, together\r\nwith some choice manuscripts, and was valued at upwards of thirty\r\nthousand pounds; the King of Denmark being anxious to purchase it of his\r\nheirs for that sum. Charles, the fifth Earl, also took great interest in\r\nthe library, and added a considerable number of books to it, among which\r\nwas a copy on vellum of the Livy of 1470, printed at Venice by Vendelin\r\nde Spira. Only one other perfect copy on vellum of this edition is known\r\nto exist. In 1749 the library was removed to Blenheim, where it remained\r\nuntil 1881. It was sold by Puttick and Simpson in five portions in 1881,\r\n1882 and 1883, and the entire sale, which consisted of thirteen thousand\r\neight hundred and fifty-eight lots, realised fifty-six thousand five\r\nhundred and eighty-one pounds, six shillings.\r\n\r\nLord Sunderland was always very liberal in his dealings with\r\nbooksellers, and the prices which he gave for his books frequently gave\r\numbrage to other collectors. Humphrey Wanley, Lord Oxford's librarian,\r\nwhen giving in his Diary an account of a book-sale which took place in\r\n1721, mentions that: 'Some books went for unaccountably high prices,\r\nwhich were bought by Mr. Vaillant, the bookseller, who had an unlimited\r\ncommission from the Earl of Sunderland. The booksellers upon this sale\r\nintend to raise the prices of philological books of the first editions,\r\nand indeed of all old editions, accordingly. Thus Mr. Noel told me that\r\nhe has actually agreed to sell the Earl of Sunderland six ... printed\r\nbooks, now coming up the river, for fifty pounds per book, although my\r\nLord gives no such prices.' And on the demise of the Earl, Wanley wrote:\r\n'This day died the Earl of Sunderland, which I the rather note here,\r\nbecause I believe by reason of his decease some benefit may accrue to\r\nthis Library, even in case his relatives will part with none of his\r\nbooks. I mean, by his raising the price of books no higher now; so that,\r\nin probability, this commodity may fall in the market, and any gentleman\r\nbe permitted to buy an uncommon old book for less than forty or fifty\r\npounds.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIAN FAIRFAX, 1676-1749\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian Fairfax, who was the eldest son of Brian Fairfax, author of the\r\n_Life of the Duke of Buckingham_ and other works, was born on the 11th\r\nof April 1676. He received his early education at Westminster School,\r\nwhere he entered as a Queen's Scholar, and from whence he went to\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, taking the degrees of B.A. in 1697 and M.A.\r\nin 1700. He became a Fellow of his College in 1698. In 1723 he was\r\nappointed a Commissioner of the Customs, a post he held until his death\r\non the 9th of January 1749.\r\n\r\nFairfax collected in his house in Panton Square a very valuable library,\r\nwhich, together with a considerable fortune, a gallery of pictures, a\r\nfine collection of Greek, Roman, and English coins and medals, and other\r\ncuriosities, he bequeathed to his relative, the Hon. Robert Fairfax, of\r\nLeeds Castle, Kent, afterwards seventh Lord Fairfax. Robert Fairfax\r\nintended to sell the library by auction on the 26th of April 1756, and\r\nthe seventeen following days; but after having advertised it, he\r\nprivately disposed of it for two thousand pounds to his kinsman, Mr.\r\nFrancis Child,[64] of Osterley Park, Isleworth, Middlesex, and the\r\nprinted catalogues, with the exception of twenty, were suppressed.[65]\r\nThe title to the catalogue of the intended sale reads: 'A Catalogue of\r\nthe Entire and Valuable Library of the Honourable Bryan Fairfax, Esq.,\r\none of the Commissioners of His Majesty's Customs, Deceased: which will\r\nbe sold by Auction, by Mr. Prestage, at his great room the end of Savile\r\nRow, next Conduit Street, Hanover Square. To begin selling on Monday,\r\nApril 26, 1756, and to continue for seventeen days successively.\r\nCatalogues to be had at the Place of Sale, and at Mr. Barthoe's,\r\nBookseller in Exeter Exchange in the Strand. Price Six-pence, pp. 68.\r\n8 deg..' In a copy of the catalogue mentioned by Dibdin in his\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_, the price at which each article was valued\r\nis given for the express purpose of the purchase of the whole by Mr.\r\nChild. Among the prices thus noted are those of the nine Caxtons which\r\nthe library contained, which altogether amounted to thirty-three pounds,\r\nfour shillings. _The Recuyell of the Histories of Troye_ was valued at\r\neight guineas, the _Confessio Amantis_ at three pounds, and the\r\n_Histories of King Arthur_ at two pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence.\r\nThe prices obtained for these books at the sale of the Osterley library\r\nin 1885 were eighteen hundred and twenty pounds, eight hundred and ten\r\npounds, and nineteen hundred and fifty pounds, respectively. The\r\ncollection became part of the Osterley library, of which a catalogue was\r\nmade in 1771 by Dr. Thomas Morell, assisted by the preceding labours of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Winchester. Only twenty-five copies of this catalogue were\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nBrian Fairfax's pictures, statues, urns, and other antiquities were sold\r\nby auction on April the 6th and 7th, and the prints and drawings on May\r\nthe 4th and 5th, 1756.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 the library passed by marriage into the family of the Earls of\r\nJersey, and on the 6th of May 1885 and seven following days it was sold\r\nby Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. The sale consisted of one thousand nine\r\nhundred and thirty-seven lots, which realised the large sum of thirteen\r\nthousand and seven pounds, nine shillings.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: The first wife of the Hon. Robert Fairfax was Martha\r\nCollins, niece to Sir Francis Child, Bart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: Nichols, _Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nvol. v. p. 326.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HEARNE, 1678-1735\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Hearne, the eminent antiquary, was born in July 1678 at\r\nLittlefield Green in the parish of White Waltham, Berkshire, where his\r\nfather, George Hearne, was the parish clerk. At a very early age he\r\nshowed such marked ability that Francis Cherry, the nonjuror, who\r\nresided at Shottesbrooke in the same neighbourhood, undertook to\r\ndefray the cost of his education, and first sent him to the free school\r\nof Bray, and afterwards, in 1695, to St. Edmund Hall, Oxford. This\r\nkindness is frequently referred to by Hearne, who speaks of his\r\nbenefactor as 'my best friend and patron.' He took the degrees of B.A.\r\nin 1679, and M.A. four years later. While an undergraduate, Dr. John\r\nMill, the Principal of St. Edmund Hall, and Dr. Grabe employed him in\r\nthe collation of manuscripts; and Hearne tells us in his _Autobiography_\r\nthat, after taking his B.A. degree, 'he constantly went to the Bodleian\r\nLibrary every day, and studied there as long as the time allowed by the\r\nStatutes would admit.' His industry and learning attracted the notice of\r\nDr. Hudson, who had been recently elected Keeper of the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, and, in 1701, by his influence Hearne was made Janitor, or\r\nAssistant, in the Library, succeeding to the post of Second Librarian in\r\n1712. The duties of this appointment he continued to perform until the\r\n23rd of January 1716, the last day fixed by the Act for taking the oaths\r\nto the Hanoverian dynasty. These oaths as a nonjuror he could not\r\nconscientiously take, and he was in consequence deprived of his office\r\non the ground of 'neglect of duty'; but the Rev. W.D. Macray, in his\r\n_Annals of the Bodleian Library_, tells us that 'to the end of his life\r\nhe maintained that he was still, _de jure_, Sub-librarian, and with a\r\nquaint pertinacity, regularly at the end of each term and half-year, up\r\nto March 30, 1735, continued to set down, in one of the volumes of his\r\nDiary, that no fees had been paid him, and that his half-year's salary\r\nwas due.' Hearne continued a staunch nonjuror to the end of his days,\r\nand refused many University appointments, including the Keepership of\r\nthe Bodleian Library, which he might have had, had he been willing to\r\ntake the oath of allegiance to the government; but he preferred, to use\r\nhis own words, 'a good conscience before all manner of preferment and\r\nworldly honour.' The Earl of Oxford offered to make him his librarian on\r\nWanley's death, but this post he also declined, and continued to reside\r\nto the end of his life at St. Edmund Hall, engaged in preparing and\r\npublishing his various antiquarian and historical works. He died on the\r\n10th of June 1735, and was buried in the churchyard of St.\r\nPeter's-in-the-East at Oxford. Hearne, who was a man of unwearied\r\nindustry, and a most devoted antiquary, is described by Pope in the\r\n_Dunciad_, under the title of Wormius--\r\n\r\n  'But who is he, in closet close ypent,\r\n  Of sober face, with learned dust besprent?\r\n  Right well mine eyes arede the myster wight,\r\n  On parchment scraps y-fed, and Wormius hight.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THOMAS HEARNE M.A. of Edmund Hall Oxon._]\r\n\r\nHearne amassed a considerable collection of manuscripts and printed\r\nbooks, of which he made a catalogue, with the prices he gave for them.\r\nThis manuscript came into the possession of Mr. Beriah Botfield, M.P.,\r\nof Norton Hall, Northamptonshire, who privately printed some extracts\r\nfrom it in 1848.\r\n\r\nHearne left all his manuscripts and books with manuscript notes to Mr.\r\nWilliam Bedford, son of the nonjuring bishop, Hilkiah Bedford, whose\r\nwidow sold them to Dr. Richard Rawlinson for one hundred guineas, and by\r\nhim they were bequeathed to the Bodleian Library. Hearne's diary and\r\nnote-books, in about one hundred and fifty small duodecimo volumes, were\r\namong them.[66] His printed books were sold by Thomas Osborne on the\r\n16th of February 1736, and following days. The title-page of the\r\ncatalogue reads: 'A Catalogue of the Valuable Library of that great\r\nAntiquarian Mr. Tho. Hearne of Oxford: and of another Gentleman of\r\nNote. Consisting of a very great Variety of Uncommon Books, and scarce\r\never to be met withal.\r\n\r\nWhich will begin to be sold very cheap, the lowest Price mark'd in each\r\nBook, at T. Osborne's Shop in Gray's Inn, on Monday the 16th day of\r\nFebruary 1735-36.'\r\n\r\nThe title-page has also a small portrait of Hearne, with the following\r\nlines below it:--\r\n\r\n  'Pox on't quoth time to Thomas Hearne,\r\n  Whatever I forget, you learn.'\r\n\r\nThe catalogue contains six thousand seven hundred and seventy-six lots.\r\n\r\nHearne's publications, which were almost all printed by subscription at\r\nOxford, are very numerous. Among the most valuable are an edition of\r\nLivy in 6 vols., 1708; the _Life of Alfred the Great_, from Sir John\r\nSpelman's manuscript in the Bodleian Library, 1710; Leland's\r\n_Itinerary_, 9 vols., 1710; Leland's _Collectanea_, 6 vols., 1715;\r\nRoper's _Life of Sir Thomas More_, 1716; Camden's _Annals_, 3 vols.,\r\n1717; _Curious Discourses by Eminent Antiquaries_, 1720; Robert of\r\nGloucester's _Chronicle_, 2 vols., 1724; Peter of Langtoft's\r\n_Chronicle_, 2 vols., 1725; _Liber Niger Scaccarii_, 2 vols., 1728; and\r\nWalter of Hemingford's _History_, 2 vols., 1731.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: Extracts from these volumes were published by Dr. Bliss in\r\n1857, and again in 1869, under the title of _Reliquiae Hearnianae_; and\r\nHearne's _Remarks and Collections_ are now being printed by the Oxford\r\nHistorical Society.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS RAWLINSON, 1681-1725\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Rawlinson, who, Dibdin says, 'may be called the Leviathan of\r\nbook-collectors during nearly the first thirty years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury,' was born in the Old Bailey on the 25th of March 1681. He was\r\nthe eldest son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson, Lord Mayor of London in 1705-6,\r\nby Mary, eldest daughter of Richard Tayler, of Turnham Green, Middlesex,\r\nwho kept the Devil Tavern near Temple Bar. He was also an elder brother\r\nof Dr. Richard Rawlinson, the nonjuring bishop, who was himself an\r\nardent collector. In 1699 he matriculated at the University of Oxford\r\nfrom St. John's College, having been previously educated at Cheam under\r\nWilliam Day, and at Eton. He was called to the bar in 1705, and applied\r\nhimself to the study of municipal law; but three years later, on the\r\ndeath of his father in 1708, who left him a large estate, he devoted\r\nhimself to the collection of books, manuscripts and pictures. His love\r\nfor books appears to have been early fostered by his grandfather,\r\nRichard Tayler, who settled upon him, while a schoolboy at Eton, an\r\nannuity of fourteen pounds per annum for his life to buy books with;\r\n'which,' Hearne informs us in his Diary, 'he not only fully expended,\r\nand nobly answered the end of the donor, but indeed laid out his whole\r\nfortune this way, so as to acquire a collection of books, both for\r\nnumber and value, hardly to be equalled by any one study in England.'\r\nFor some years Rawlinson resided in Gray's Inn, but in 1716, having\r\nfilled his four rooms so completely with books that he was obliged to\r\nsleep in the passage, he was compelled to move, and he took lodgings at\r\nLondon House, in Aldersgate Street, an ancient palace of the bishops of\r\nLondon, but at that time the residence of Mr. Samuel May, a wealthy\r\ndruggist. Here he lived, says Oldys, 'in his bundles, piles, and\r\nbulwarks of paper, in dust and cobwebs,' until the 6th of August 1725,\r\nwhen he died, and was buried in St. Botolph's Church, Aldersgate Street.\r\n\r\nRawlinson was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries. He was also a Governor of Bridewell and Bethlehem\r\nHospitals. About a year before his decease he married his servant, Amy\r\nFrewin, but left no issue.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his life Rawlinson became involved in pecuniary\r\ndifficulties, and he sold a portion of his collection by auction to meet\r\nhis liabilities. Prior to his death there were five sales, the first of\r\nwhich took place on the 4th of December 1721, which realised two\r\nthousand four hundred and nine pounds. But when he died an enormous\r\nnumber of books were still left, and it required eleven additional\r\nsales, which extended to March 1734, to dispose of them and the\r\nmanuscripts, of which there were upwards of a thousand. These sales\r\nlasted on an average for more than twenty-one days each, but it should\r\nbe observed that they took place in the evening, generally commencing\r\nat five o'clock. All Rawlinson's books were sold by Thomas Ballard, the\r\nbookseller, at the St. Paul's Coffee House, with the exception of those\r\ndisposed of at the seventh and eighth sales, which were sold by Charles\r\nDavis, the bookseller; the former at London House, and the latter at the\r\nBedford Coffee House, in the great Piazza, Covent Garden. In addition to\r\nthe printed books and manuscripts, Rawlinson's gallery of paintings was\r\nsold at the Two Golden Bulls in Hart Street, Covent Garden, on April the\r\n4th and 5th 1734, in one hundred and seventeen lots. Among the portraits\r\nwas one in crayons of Rawlinson by his brother Richard.\r\n\r\nCopies of the sale catalogues of Thomas Rawlinson's books are very rare,\r\nbut the Bodleian Library possesses an entire set of them, almost all of\r\nwhich are marked with the prices which the books fetched, while two or\r\nthree have also the names of the purchasers. A fairly correct list of\r\nthem is given by Dibdin in his _Bibliomania_, which he made from a\r\ncomplete collection of them in the Heber library. The catalogue of the\r\nmanuscripts was compiled by Rawlinson's brother Richard.\r\n\r\nRawlinson's books appear to have realised but poor prices, for Hearne\r\nwrites in his Diary (Nov. 10th, 1734), that 'Dr. Rawlinson by the sale\r\nof his brother's books hath not rais'd near the money expected. For, it\r\nseems, they have ill answer'd, however good books; the MSS. worse, and\r\nwhat the prints will do is as yet undetermin'd.' No doubt the low prices\r\nwere caused by the immense number of books thrown upon the market by\r\nRawlinson's sales; for, as early as April 1723, Hearne tells us in his\r\nDiary that 'the editions of classicks of the first print (commonly\r\ncalled _Editiones Principes_), that used to go at prodigious prices, are\r\nnow strangely lowered; occasioned, in good measure, by Mr. Tho.\r\nRawlinson, my friend's, being forced to sell many of his books, in whose\r\nauction these books went cheap, tho' English history and antiquities\r\nwent dear: and yet this gentleman was the chief man that raised many\r\ncurious and classical books so high, by his generous and couragious way\r\nof bidding.' It is quite possible too that Rawlinson's books were not\r\nalways in the finest condition, and had suffered from the dust and\r\ncobwebs of which Oldys speaks.\r\n\r\nThe Caxtons, of which there were upwards of five and twenty (perfect and\r\nimperfect), realised but very moderate prices. _The Recuyell of the\r\nHistories of Troy_ sold for two pounds, seven shillings; Gower's\r\n_Confessio Amantis_ for two pounds, fourteen shillings and sixpence;\r\n_The Golden Legend_ for three pounds, twelve shillings; and Lydgate's\r\n_Life of Our Lady_ for two pounds, thirteen shillings. _The Histories of\r\nKing Arthur and his Knights_, for which Mr. Quaritch, at the Earl of\r\nJersey's sale in 1885, gave as much as nineteen hundred and fifty\r\npounds, fetched no more than two pounds, four shillings and sixpence.\r\nThese were the highest prices obtained. Many of the volumes went for a\r\nfew shillings--the first edition of _The Dictes or Sayings_ for fifteen\r\nshillings, Chaucer's _Book of Fame_ for nine shillings and twopence, and\r\n_The Moral Proverbs of Christine de Pisan_ for four shillings and\r\ntenpence. Mr. Blades does not make any mention of Thomas Rawlinson's\r\nCaxtons in his life of the printer.\r\n\r\nRawlinson appears to have greatly increased the number of separate works\r\nin his library by breaking up the volumes of tracts; for Oldys\r\ncomplains, 'that out of one volume he made many, and all the tracts or\r\npamphlets that came to his hands in volumes and bound together, he\r\nseparated to sell them singly, so that what some curious men had been\r\npairing and sorting half their lives to have a topic or argument\r\ncomplete, he by this means confused and dispersed again.'\r\n\r\nDr. Richard Rawlinson said of his brother that he collected in almost\r\nall faculties, but more particularly old and beautiful editions of the\r\nclassical authors, and whatever directly or indirectly related to\r\nEnglish history. As early as 1712 Rawlinson told Hearne that his library\r\nhad cost him two thousand pounds, and that it was worth five thousand.\r\nAmong many other choice and rare books in the collection were three\r\ncopies of Archbishop Parker's _De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae_. Two\r\nof them are now in the Bodleian Library, and the Rev. W.D. Macray, in\r\nhis _Annals of the Bodleian Library_, states that 'one of these is the\r\nidentical copy described by Strype in his Life of Parker, and which was\r\nthen in possession of Bp. Fleetwood of Ely.'\r\n\r\nRawlinson's passion for collecting books was evidently well known to his\r\ncontemporaries, for Addison, who disliked and despised bibliomaniacs,\r\ngives a satirical account of him, under the name of 'Tom Folio,' in No.\r\n158 of _The Tatler_. Hearne, who was greatly indebted to Rawlinson for\r\nassistance in his antiquarian labours, warmly defends his friend:--'Some\r\ngave out,' he writes, 'and published it too in printed papers, that Mr.\r\nRawlinson understood the editions and title-pages of books only, without\r\nany other skill in them, and thereupon they styled him TOM FOLIO. But\r\nthese were only buffoons, and persons of very shallow learning. 'Tis\r\ncertain that Mr. Rawlinson understood the titles and editions of books\r\nbetter than any man I ever knew (for he had a very great memory), but\r\nbesides this, he was a great reader, and had read abundantly of the best\r\nwriters, ancient and modern, throughout, and was entirely master of the\r\nlearning contained in them. He had digested the classicks so well as to\r\nbe able readily and upon all occasions (what I have very often admired)\r\nto make use of passages from them very pertinently, what I never knew in\r\nso great perfection in any other person whatsoever.'[67]\r\n\r\nA poem of twenty-six lines by Rawlinson on the death of the Duke of\r\nGloucester in 1700 was printed in a collection of verses written by\r\nmembers of the University of Oxford on that event. This appears to be\r\nhis only publication with his name attached. The pretty edition of the\r\n_Satires of Juvenal and Persius_, published at London in 1716, and\r\nedited by Michael Maittaire, was dedicated by him to Rawlinson.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in Nichols's _Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century_\r\n(vol. v. p. 704) that the following inscription was found among the\r\npapers of Rawlinson, written with his own hand, and in all probability\r\ndesigned by him for part of an epitaph on himself:--\r\n\r\n  'Hic jacet----Vir liberrimi Spiritus\r\n  qui omnes Mortales pari ratione habuit;\r\n  tacuisse de Criminibus non auro vendidit.\r\n  Qui, Rege dempto, neminem agnovit superiorem;\r\n  illum vero, O infortunium! nunquam potuit\r\n  inspicere.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Diary_, Sept. 4, 1725.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSEPH SMITH, 1682-1770\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-PLATE OF JOSEPH SMITH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith, a portion of whose collection formed the foundation of\r\nKing George III.'s library, now in the British Museum, was born in 1682.\r\nNothing appears to be known about his parents and his early years, but\r\nat the age of nineteen he took up his residence at Venice, where he\r\nspent his life, apparently engaged in commerce.[68] In 1740 he was\r\nappointed British Consul in that city, and he died there on the 6th of\r\nNovember 1770, aged eighty-eight.\r\n\r\nSmith was well known as a collector of books, manuscripts, and works of\r\nart. In 1762 George III. purchased all the books Smith had amassed up to\r\nthat time for about ten thousand pounds, and at a later period the king\r\nalso bought his pictures, coins, and gems for the sum of twenty thousand\r\npounds. After the sale of his library Smith still continued to collect,\r\nand the books which he subsequently acquired were sold after his death,\r\npartly by auction by Baker and Leigh at their house in York Street,\r\nCovent Garden, on Monday, January 25th, 1773, and the thirteen following\r\ndays, and partly in the shop of James Robson, bookseller, in New Bond\r\nStreet. Those sold by Baker and Leigh realised two thousand two hundred\r\nand forty-five pounds. A portion of his manuscripts was purchased by the\r\nEarl of Sunderland for one thousand five hundred pounds. Smith's library\r\nwas rich in the best and scarcest editions of Latin, Italian and French\r\nauthors. It also contained a considerable number of fine manuscripts,\r\nsome of them beautifully illuminated, and many valuable books of prints\r\nand antiquities.\r\n\r\nAbout 1727 Smith compiled a catalogue, which was limited to twenty-five\r\ncopies, of some of the rarest books in his collection, of which a second\r\nedition with additions was published in 1737. A catalogue of his entire\r\nlibrary was printed at Venice in 1755, and in 1767 an account of his\r\nantique gems in two volumes folio, written by Antonio Francesco Gori,\r\nwas published in the same city under the title of _Dactyliotheca\r\nSmithiana_. An edition of Boccaccio's _Decamerone_ was brought out by\r\nSmith in 1729.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: _Dictionary of National Biography._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. RICHARD RAWLINSON, 1690-1755\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Rawlinson was the fourth son of Sir Thomas Rawlinson, Lord Mayor\r\nof London in 1705-6, and younger brother of Thomas Rawlinson the\r\ncollector. He was born in the Old Bailey on the 3rd of January 1690,\r\nand, after having received his early education at St. Paul's School and\r\nEton, matriculated as a commoner of St. John's College, Oxford, in 1708;\r\nbut, in consequence of the death of his father, he became a\r\ngentleman-commoner in the following year. He took the degrees of B.A. in\r\n1711, M.A. in 1713, and in 1719 he was created D.C.L. On the 21st of\r\nSeptember 1716 he was ordained deacon, and two days later, priest among\r\nthe nonjurors by Bishop Jeremy Collier, in Mr. Laurence's chapel on\r\nCollege Hill, London.[69] After his ordination he travelled through a\r\ngreat part of England, and in 1719 paid a visit to France, and\r\nafterwards to the Low Countries, where he was admitted into the\r\nUniversities of Utrecht and Leyden. Towards the end of the year he\r\nreturned home, but in 1720 he again left England, and spent several\r\nyears in France, Germany, Italy, and other parts of the Continent. In\r\nApril 1726 he again came home, in consequence of the death of his\r\nbrother, which took place in the preceding year. During his travels he\r\nkept a series of note-books, some of which are preserved among his\r\nmiscellaneous manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. In 1728 he was\r\nconsecrated bishop by the nonjuring bishops Gandy, Doughty and\r\nBlackbourne in Gandy's chapel, but he appears to have been always\r\ndesirous of concealing both his clerical and episcopal character, for in\r\na letter written in 1736 to Mr. T. Rawlins of Pophills, Warwickshire, he\r\nrequests him not to address him as 'Rev.'[70] Dr. Rawlinson was elected\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society in 1714, and a Fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries in 1727, but later he quarrelled with both these Societies,\r\nand stipulated in his will that the recipients of his bequests should\r\nnot be Fellows. He was also a Governor of Bridewell, Bethlehem, and St.\r\nBartholomew's Hospitals.\r\n\r\nDr. Rawlinson lived for some time in Gray's Inn, but shortly after the\r\ndeath of his brother Thomas he took up his abode in the rooms which had\r\nbeen occupied by him in London House in Aldersgate Street. He died at\r\nIslington on the 6th of April 1755, and was buried, in accordance with a\r\ndirection in a codicil to his will, in St. Giles's Church, Oxford. His\r\nheart, which he bequeathed as a token of affection to St. John's\r\nCollege, Oxford, is preserved in a marble urn in the chapel of that\r\nCollege, inscribed with the text 'Ubi thesaurus, ibi cor,' and with his\r\nname and the date of his death. It is said that Rawlinson also left\r\ninstructions that a head, which he believed to be that of Counsellor\r\nChristopher Layer, the Jacobite conspirator, who was executed in 1723,\r\nshould be buried with him, placed in his right hand; but this\r\ninjunction, if really made, does not appear to have been complied\r\nwith.[71]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. RICHARD RAWLINSON.]\r\n\r\nRawlinson devoted himself to antiquarian pursuits, and, like his brother\r\nThomas, was an enthusiastic collector of manuscripts and books. The\r\nRev. W.D. Macray, in his _Annals of the Bodleian Library_, says that his\r\ncollections were 'formed abroad and at home, the choice of\r\nbook-auctions, the pickings of chandlers' and grocers' waste-paper,\r\neverything, especially, in the shape of a MS., from early copies of\r\nClassics and Fathers to the well-nigh most recent log-books of sailors'\r\nvoyages. Not a sale of MSS. occurred, apparently, in London, during his\r\ntime, at which he was not an omnigenous purchaser; so that students of\r\nevery subject now bury themselves in his stores with great content and\r\nprofit. But history in all its branches, heraldry and genealogy,\r\nbiography and topography, are his especially strong points.'\r\n\r\nRawlinson bequeathed all his manuscripts, with the exception of private\r\npapers and letters, 'to the chancellor, masters and scholars of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, to be placed in the Bodleian Library, or in such\r\nother place as they should deem proper'; and he further directed that\r\nthey should be 'kept separate and apart from any other collection.' All\r\nhis deeds and charters, his books printed on vellum or silk, and those\r\ncontaining MS. notes, together with some antiquities and curiosities,\r\nwere also left by him to the University. His manuscript and printed\r\nmusic he bequeathed to the Music School. The number of manuscripts left\r\nby him exceeded four thousand eight hundred in number, together with a\r\nlarge collection of charters and deeds. A catalogue of them has been\r\nmade by the Rev. W.D. Macray, the author of the _Annals of the Bodleian\r\nLibrary_. The printed books which he selected from his library for the\r\nUniversity amounted to between eighteen and nineteen hundred.[72] Other\r\nbooks and manuscripts, together with some valuable pictures and coins,\r\nwere given by him to the Bodleian Library during his lifetime. The\r\nremainder of his printed books, with the exception of a few which he\r\nbequeathed to St. John's College, were sold by auction by Samuel Baker,\r\nof York Street, Covent Garden, at two sales. The first commenced on the\r\n29th of March 1756, and lasted fifty days. It consisted of nine thousand\r\nfour hundred and five lots, which fetched one thousand one hundred and\r\nsixty-one pounds, eighteen shillings and sixpence. The second sale,\r\nwhich, as the preface to the catalogue informs us, consisted of 'upwards\r\nof Twenty Thousand Pamphlets ... and his most Uncommon, Rare and Old\r\nBooks,' began on Thursday, March 3rd, 1757, and was continued on the\r\nnine following evenings. It realised but two hundred and three pounds,\r\nthirteen shillings and sixpence. These were followed by a sale of\r\nprints, books of prints and drawings, upwards of ten thousand in number.\r\nOne hundred and sixty-three pounds, ten shillings and threepence,\r\nhowever, was all that could be obtained for them. Marked catalogues of\r\nthe three sales are preserved in the Library of King George III. in the\r\nBritish Museum. The prices at all the sales were very low. There were\r\nthree Caxtons in the first sale--_Tully of Old Age_, _Curia Sapientiae_,\r\nand the _Order of Chivalry_, which fetched respectively one pound five\r\nshillings, six shillings, and eleven shillings. The prints and drawings\r\nfared even worse than the printed books. One hundred and three prints by\r\nAlbert Duerer, in two lots, sold for one pound, ten shillings and\r\nsixpence, and a large collection of woodcuts by the same artist for half\r\na crown. Twenty-four etchings by Rembrandt, in four lots, realised but\r\nthree pounds, five shillings; while eleven shillings and sixpence was\r\nall that could be got for thirty-four heads and thirty-five views by\r\nHollar.\r\n\r\nThe collection of manuscripts which Dr. Rawlinson bequeathed to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford is a magnificent one, and Mr. Macray gives a long\r\nand very interesting account of it in his _Annals of the Bodleian\r\nLibrary_. It contains some fine Biblical manuscripts, and about one\r\nhundred and thirty Missals, Horae, and other Service-books, many of them\r\nfrom the library of the celebrated collector Nicolas Joseph Foucault. It\r\nis rich in early copies of the classics, and there are upwards of two\r\nhundred volumes of poetry, including the works of Chaucer, Hoccleve,\r\nLydgate, etc. English history is remarkably well represented. Among the\r\nmanuscripts of this division of the collection are the _Thurloe State\r\nPapers_ in sixty-seven volumes, which were published by Dr. Birch in\r\n1742, and the _Miscellaneous Papers_ of Samuel Pepys in twenty-five\r\nvolumes. The Pepys papers, among other very interesting matter,\r\ncomprise many curious dockyard account-books of the reigns of King Henry\r\nVIII. and Queen Elizabeth. This division also contains some important\r\nletters of King Charles II., King James II., and the Duke of Monmouth,\r\ntogether with an acknowledgment by Monmouth that Charles II. had\r\ndeclared that he was never married to Lucy Walters, the Duke's mother.\r\nThis was written and signed by him on the day of his execution, and\r\nwitnessed by Bishops Turner and Ken, and also by Tenison and Hooper. As\r\nmight be expected, the number of works relating to topography, heraldry\r\nand genealogy is very large. The collection also comprises many Irish\r\nmanuscripts, a considerable number of Italian papers bearing on English\r\nhistory, and the valuable collections made by Rawlinson for a\r\ncontinuation of Wood's _Athenae Oxonienses_, and for a History of Eton\r\nCollege. There are one hundred volumes of letters, two hundred volumes\r\nof sermons, and the immense quantity of ancient charters and deeds\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nRawlinson also bequeathed to the University Hearne's daily diary and\r\nnote-books in about one hundred and fifty small duodecimo volumes, which\r\nhe had bought of the widow of Mr. William Bedford.\r\n\r\nAmong the printed books is a magnificent collection of the original\r\nbroadside proclamations issued during the reign of Elizabeth, and a set\r\nof almanacs extending from 1607 to 1747, bound in one hundred and\r\nseventy-five volumes.[73]\r\n\r\nTo St. John's College, Rawlinson bequeathed a large portion of his\r\nestate, amounting to about seven hundred pounds a year, a few of his\r\nprinted books, a collection of coins, etc.; and to the College of\r\nSurgeons he gave some anatomical specimens. He also left property to\r\nendow a professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, and to provide a salary\r\nfor the Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. But all his endowments were\r\naccompanied by eccentric restrictions, which remained in force until a\r\nfew years ago, when they were annulled by statute. He directed 'that no\r\nnative of Scotland or Ireland, or of any of the plantations abroad, or\r\nany of their sons, or any present or future member of the Royal or\r\nAntiquary societies,' should hold these endowments; and in the case of\r\nthe Ashmolean Museum, he further enjoined that the Keeper 'is not to be\r\na doctor in divinity or in holy orders ... neither born nor educated in\r\nScotland, neither a married man nor a widower, but one who hath\r\nregularly proceeded in Oxford to the degrees of master of arts or\r\nbachelor of law.'\r\n\r\nRawlinson wrote a considerable number of works, chiefly of an\r\nantiquarian or topographical nature. Among the more important are _The\r\nEnglish Topographer_, _The History and Antiquities of the City and\r\nCathedral Church of Hereford_, _The History and Antiquities of the\r\nCathedral Church of Rochester_, _The History and Antiquities of\r\nGlastonbury_; and a _Life of Anthony a Wood_. He also edited Aubrey's\r\n_Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey_, and other books.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Rawlinson, like his father and his brother, was a warm\r\nJacobite, he does not appear to have taken part in any of the movements\r\nfor the restoration of the Stuart family to the throne. He entirely\r\noccupied himself with antiquarian and literary pursuits, and the\r\nformation of his noble collections. In order that he might devote as\r\nmuch as possible of his income to the purchase of books and antiquities,\r\nhe denied himself the luxuries, and even the comforts of life; and he\r\nwent about so meanly clad, that the coachman of his late father\r\nhappening to meet him one day, and judging from his appearance that he\r\nwas in a destitute condition, begged his acceptance of half a crown to\r\nrelieve his distress. The story is told by Dr. Rawlinson himself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Rev. W.D. Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_.\r\nLondon, etc., 1868, p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: _Ibid._ p. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: When the head of Layer was blown off from Temple Bar\r\n(where it had been placed after his execution), it was picked up by a\r\ngentleman in that neighbourhood, who showed it to some friends at a\r\npublic-house; under the floor of which house, I have been assured, it\r\nwas buried. Dr. Rawlinson, mean-time, having made enquiry after the\r\nhead, with a wish to purchase it, was imposed on with another instead of\r\nLayer's, which he preserved as a valuable relique, and directed it to be\r\nburied in his hand.--Nichols, _Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth\r\nCentury_, vol. v. p. 497.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_, p. 170.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Rawlinson also left to the University some autograph\r\nwritings of King James I. The existence of these had been forgotten, and\r\nhas only been recently discovered.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN FOLKES, 1690-1754\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin Folkes, the eminent antiquary and scientist, was the eldest son\r\nof Martin Folkes, a Bencher of Gray's Inn. He was born in Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields, London, on the 29th of October 1690, and after receiving his\r\nearly education at the University of Saumur, was sent, in 1707, to Clare\r\nHall, Cambridge, where he so greatly distinguished himself in all\r\nbranches of learning, and more particularly in mathematics and\r\nphilosophy, that in 1714, when only twenty-three years of age, he was\r\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and two years later was chosen\r\none of its Council. In 1723 he was appointed a Vice-President of the\r\nSociety, and on the retirement of Sir Hans Sloane in 1741 he became\r\nPresident, a post he held until 1753, when he resigned it on account of\r\nhis health. Folkes was also elected a Fellow of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries in 1720, and in 1750 he succeeded the Duke of Somerset as\r\nPresident, an office he filled during the remainder of his life. His\r\nattainments were also recognised by the French Academy, which elected\r\nhim in 1742 one of its members. He was a D.C.L. of the University of\r\nOxford, and LL.D. of the University of Cambridge. He died on the 28th of\r\nJune 1754, and was buried in the chancel of Hillington Church, Norfolk.\r\nIn 1792 a monument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nFolkes, who was the author of two works on English coins, and several\r\npapers in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society and the\r\n_Archaeologia_ of the Society of Antiquaries, formed a fine collection of\r\nbooks, prints, drawings, pictures, gems, coins, etc., a considerable\r\nportion of which he acquired during his travels in Italy and Germany.\r\nHis library, which was very rich in works on natural history, coins,\r\nmedals, inscriptions, and the fine arts, was sold by Samuel Baker, York\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, on Monday, February the 2nd 1756, and forty\r\nfollowing days. The sale consisted of five thousand one hundred and\r\ntwenty-six lots, which produced three thousand and ninety-one pounds,\r\nsix shillings. A catalogue, marked with the prices, is preserved in the\r\nLibrary of King George III. in the British Museum. A copy of the first\r\nShakespeare folio fetched but three guineas. The sale of Folkes's prints\r\nand drawings occupied eight days, and that of his pictures, gems, coins,\r\nand mathematical instruments five days. Dibdin says that 'the MSS. of\r\nhis own composition, not being quite perfect, were, to the great loss of\r\nthe learned world, ordered by him to be destroyed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM OLDYS, 1696-1761\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Oldys, Norroy King-at-Arms, was born on the 14th of July 1696.\r\nThere is some obscurity respecting his parentage, but there is little\r\ndoubt he was the natural son of Dr. William Oldys, Chancellor of\r\nLincoln, and Advocate of the Admiralty Court. His father left him some\r\nproperty, which he appears to have lost in the South Sea Bubble. From\r\nthe year 1724 to 1730 Oldys resided in Yorkshire, but in the latter year\r\nhe returned to London, and became acquainted with Edward Harley, the\r\nsecond Earl of Oxford, to whom he sold his collection of manuscripts for\r\nforty pounds. In 1738 the Earl appointed him his literary secretary and\r\nlibrarian, first at a salary of one hundred and fifty pounds, and\r\nafterwards of two hundred pounds, a year. Unfortunately the Earl died in\r\n1741, and Oldys was obliged to earn a precarious livelihood by working\r\nfor booksellers, and was soon involved in pecuniary difficulties. He was\r\nconfined in the Fleet prison from 1751 to 1753, when he was released by\r\nthe kindness of the Duke of Norfolk, who not only paid his debts, but in\r\n1755 procured for him the office of Norroy King-at-Arms, which congenial\r\npost he held for six years. He died at his rooms in Heralds' College on\r\nthe 15th of April 1761, and was buried in the church of St. Benet,\r\nPaul's Wharf. A portrait of him will be found in the _European Magazine_\r\nfor November 1796. The principal works by Oldys are a _Life of Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh_, prefixed to an edition of his _History of the World_,\r\nprinted in 1736; _The British Librarian_, published anonymously in\r\n1738; and _The Harleian Miscellany_, published in 1744-46. He also\r\nannotated _England's Parnassus_, and two copies of Langbaine's _Account\r\nof the early Dramatick Poets_. One of these copies was purchased by Dr.\r\nBirch at the sale of Oldys's books for one guinea, and was bequeathed by\r\nhim to the British Museum. Twenty-two of the lives in _Biographia\r\nBritannica_ were from his pen, and in addition to the works already\r\nmentioned he wrote a few minor ones on bibliographical and medical\r\nsubjects. Oldys's library was not a large one, but it contained some\r\nvery interesting and scarce books. After his death it was purchased by\r\nThomas Davies, the bookseller, author of _Memoirs of the Life of\r\nGarrick_, and was sold by him in 1762. The title of the sale catalogue\r\nreads: 'A Catalogue of the Libraries of the late William Oldys, Esq.,\r\nNorroy King-at-Arms (author of _The Life of Sir Walter Raleigh_); the\r\nRev. Mr. Emms of Yarmouth, and Mr. Wm. Rush, which will begin to be sold\r\non Monday, April 12 [1762] by Thomas Davies.' The books were disposed of\r\nfor extremely low prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RATCLIFFE,  -1776\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing appears to be known of the parentage and birth of John\r\nRatcliffe, the collector, who for some years kept a chandler's shop in\r\nSouthwark, where he seems to have amassed a sufficient competency to\r\nenable him to retire from business and devote the remainder of his life\r\nto the acquisition of old books. It is said that his passion for\r\ncollecting them arose from the perusal of some of the volumes which were\r\npurchased by him for the purpose of wrapping his wares in. Ratcliffe\r\nkept his library at his house in East Lane, Bermondsey, where, Nichols\r\ninforms us in his _Literary Anecdotes_, 'he used to give Coffee and\r\nChocolate every Thursday morning to Book and Print Collectors; Dr.\r\nAskew, Messrs. Beauclerk, Bull, Croft, Samuel Gillam, West, etc., used\r\nto attend, when he would produce some of his fine purchases.' Nichols\r\nadds, 'he generally used to spend whole days in the Booksellers'\r\nwarehouses; and, that he might not lose time, would get them to procure\r\nhim a chop or a steak.' An amusing letter respecting him appeared in the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1812. The writer states that 'Mr. John\r\nRadcliffe was neither a man of science or learning. He lived in East\r\nLane, Bermondsey; was a very corpulent man, and his legs were remarkably\r\nthick, probably from an anasarcous complaint. The writer of this\r\nremembers him perfectly well; he was a very stately man, and, when he\r\nwalked, literally went at a snail's pace. He was a Dissenter, and every\r\nSunday attended the meeting of Dr. Flaxman in the lower road to\r\nDeptford. He generally wore a fine coat, either red or brown, with gold\r\nlace buttons, and a fine silk embroidered waistcoat, of scarlet with\r\ngold lace, and a large and well-powdered wig. With his hat in one hand,\r\nand a gold-headed cane in the other, he marched royally along, and not\r\nunfrequently followed by a parcel of children, wondering who the stately\r\nman could be. A few years before his death, a fire happened in the\r\nneighbourhood where he lived; and it became necessary to remove part of\r\nhis household furniture and books. He was incapable of assisting\r\nhimself; but he stood in the street lamenting and deploring the loss of\r\nhis Caxtons, when a sailor, who lived within a few doors of him\r\nattempted to console him: \"Bless you, Sir, I have got them perfectly\r\nsafe!\" While Ratcliffe was expressing his thanks, the sailor produced\r\ntwo of his fine curled periwigs, which he had saved from the devouring\r\nelement; and who had no idea that Ratcliffe could make such a fuss for a\r\nfew books.' He died in 1776.\r\n\r\nRatcliffe's collection, though not large, was marvellously rich in the\r\nproductions of the early English printers; and the volumes were\r\ngenerally in fine condition, and handsomely bound, though not always in\r\ngood taste. It contained no less than forty-eight Caxtons, among which\r\nwere the _Game of the Chesse_, the _Dictes or Sayings of the\r\nPhilosophers_, the _History of Jason_, and Chaucer's _Canterbury\r\nTales_. It comprised also numerous books from the presses of the\r\nSchoolmaster of St. Albans, Lettou, Machlinia, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde,\r\netc., and a few manuscripts. Dibdin in his _Bibliomania_ remarks: 'If\r\never there was a unique collection, this was one--the very essence of\r\nOld Divinity, Poetry, Romances and Chronicles.' Ratcliffe compiled a\r\nmanuscript catalogue of his library in four volumes, which was disposed\r\nof at the sale of his collection for seven pounds, fifteen shillings. It\r\nis said that he always wrote on the first fly-leaf of his books\r\n'Perfect'--or otherwise, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nAfter his death his library was sold by auction by Mr. Christie of Pall\r\nMall. The sale, which commenced on the 27th of March 1776 and lasted\r\ntill April 6th, consisted of one thousand six hundred and seventy-five\r\nlots. It does not appear to have been well managed, for Nichols says,\r\n'there were many hundred most rare Black-letter books and Tracts,\r\nunbound, with curious cuts. They were sold I remember in large bundles,\r\nand were piled under the tables in the Auction Room, on which the other\r\nbooks were exposed to view, and were not seen by the Booksellers who\r\nwere the purchasers.' A priced copy of the catalogue is preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, which shows that the Caxtons fetched but two hundred and\r\nthirty-six pounds, five shillings and sixpence; the highest prices\r\nobtained being sixteen pounds for the _Game of the Chesse_, fifteen\r\nguineas for the _Dictes or Sayings of the Philosophers_, and nine\r\npounds, fifteen shillings for the _Golden Legende_. King George III.\r\nbought twenty of the Caxtons at an aggregate cost of about eighty-five\r\npounds. Among them were the _De Consolatione Philosophiae_ of Boethius,\r\n_Reynard the Foxe_, the _Golden Legende_, the _Curial_, and the\r\n_Speculum Vitae Christi_. The Boethius, which was a fine copy, was\r\nacquired for four pounds, six shillings. A copy of the _Bokys of Hawkyng\r\nand Huntyng, etc._, ascribed to Dame Juliana Bernes, printed at St.\r\nAlbans in 1486, sold for nine pounds, twelve shillings, and a manuscript\r\nBible on vellum, finely illuminated, for two pounds, ten shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES WEST, 1704?-1772\r\n\r\n\r\nJames West, who is described by Dibdin as 'a Non-Pareil Collector: the\r\nfirst who, after the days of Richard Smith, succeeded in reviving the\r\nlove of black-letter lore and of Caxtonian typography,' was born about\r\n1704. He was the son of Richard West of Priors Marston in Warwickshire,\r\nsaid to be descended from Leonard, a younger son of Thomas West, Lord de\r\nla Warr, who died in 1525. James West was educated at Balliol College,\r\nOxford, whence he took the degrees of B.A. in 1723 and M.A. in 1726. In\r\n1721 he was admitted as a student at the Inner Temple, and was called to\r\nthe Bar in 1728. On the 4th of January 1737, while residing in the\r\nTemple, he lost a large portion of his collections, valued at nearly\r\nthree thousand pounds, through a fire in his chambers.[74] In 1741 he\r\nwas elected one of the representatives in Parliament for St. Albans, and\r\nwas appointed one of the Joint Secretaries of the Treasury, which post\r\nhe held until 1762. Three or four years later his patron the Duke of\r\nNewcastle obtained for him a pension of two thousand a year. He sat for\r\nSt. Albans until 1768, and afterwards represented the constituency of\r\nBoroughbridge in Yorkshire until his death on July the 2nd, 1772. He was\r\nRecorder of Poole for many years, and also High Steward of St. Albans.\r\nHe married the daughter of Sir Thomas Stephens, timber merchant in\r\nSouthwark, with whom he had a large fortune in houses in Rotherhithe.\r\n\r\nWest had a great love for scientific and antiquarian pursuits, and as\r\nearly as 1726 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the\r\nfollowing year a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, of which he\r\nbecame a Vice-President. Of the first-named Society he was chosen\r\nTreasurer in 1736 and President in 1768, which office he held during the\r\nremainder of his life. In addition to his extensive and valuable\r\nlibrary of manuscripts and printed books, West collected paintings,\r\nprints, and drawings, coins and medals, plate, and miscellaneous\r\ncuriosities. His collection of printed books was exceedingly rich in\r\nearly English ones. It contained no fewer than thirty-four Caxtons, and\r\na large number of works from the presses of Lettou, Machlinia, the\r\nanonymous 'Scole mayster' of St. Albans, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, and\r\nthe rest of the old English typographers, many of which were unique\r\ncopies. His manuscripts were exceptionally interesting and valuable.\r\nThese, with some exceptions, were bought by William, Earl of Shelburne,\r\nafterwards Marquis of Lansdowne, and were subsequently purchased by\r\nParliament, together with the other manuscripts of the Marquis, for the\r\nBritish Museum. Many of the manuscripts had previously belonged to\r\nBishop Kennet.\r\n\r\nWest's coins, pictures, prints, drawings, and museum of curiosities were\r\ndisposed of at various sales in the early part of 1773,[75] and on the\r\n29th of March and twenty-three following days in the same year his\r\nlibrary was sold by Messrs. Langford[76] at his late dwelling-house in\r\nKing Street, Covent Garden.[77] There were four thousand six hundred and\r\nfifty-three lots, which realised two thousand nine hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven pounds, one shilling. A copy of the catalogue with the\r\nprices and the names of the purchasers is preserved in the Library of\r\nKing George III. in the British Museum. Many of the more valuable books\r\nwere purchased by Gough, the antiquary, the greater part of which were\r\nbequeathed by him to the Bodleian Library. Although Horace Walpole, in a\r\nletter to the Rev. W. Cole, dated April 7th, 1773, writes that he\r\nconsidered 'the books were selling outrageously,' the prices were only\r\nfairly good for the time, and not high. The thirty-four Caxtons realised\r\nno more than three hundred and sixty-one pounds, four shillings and\r\nsixpence. The highest prices obtained were forty-seven pounds, fifteen\r\nshillings and sixpence for the first edition of Chaucer's _Canterbury\r\nTales_, thirty-two pounds, eleven shillings for the _Recuyell of the\r\nHistories of Troy_, thirty-two pounds and sixpence for the first edition\r\nof the _Game of the Chesse_, and twenty-one pounds for the second\r\nedition of the _Dictes or Sayings of the Philosophers_. These four works\r\nwere purchased for King George III., who bought largely at the sale.\r\nAmong many other rare English books a fine example of the _Bokys of\r\nHawkyng and Huntyng_, printed at St. Albans in 1486, fetched thirteen\r\npounds, and unique copies of two works from the press of Wynkyn de\r\nWorde--_The Passe Tyme of Pleasure_, 1517, and the _Historye of Olyver\r\nof Castille_, 1518--three guineas, and one pound, twelve shillings\r\nrespectively. The latter book was reprinted in 1898 by Mr.\r\nChristie-Miller for the Roxburghe Club. It was edited by Mr. R.E.\r\nGraves, late Assistant-Keeper, Department of Printed Books, British\r\nMuseum. West's famous collection of ballads, which was begun by Robert\r\nHarley, Earl of Oxford, was bought for twenty pounds by Major Pearson,\r\nwho made many additions to it. It afterwards came into the possession of\r\nthe Duke of Roxburghe, by whom it was also greatly enlarged. After\r\npassing through the library of Mr. Bright, it was finally acquired in\r\n1845 by the trustees of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAmong the manuscripts a beautifully illuminated Missal, made by order of\r\nKing Henry VII. for his daughter Margaret, afterwards Queen Consort of\r\nJames IV., King of Scotland, was bought by the Duke of Northumberland\r\nfor thirty-two pounds, eleven shillings; a Book of Hours sold for\r\nforty-three pounds, one shilling; and a manuscript of Boccaccio for\r\ntwenty-five pounds, four shillings. Both of these manuscripts had\r\nexceedingly fine illuminations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Oldys, _Diary_, London, 1862, p. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Horace Walpole says that the prints sold for the 'frantic\r\nsum of L1495, 10s.'--_Letters_, London, 1857-59, vol. v. p. 439.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Nichols states that the books were sold by auction under\r\nthe name of Messrs.

In\r\n1752 Heath was elected town-clerk of Exeter, an appointment he held\r\nuntil his death on the 13th of September 1766. In 1762 the University of\r\nOxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L. He was the author of\r\nseveral works, principally on the Greek and Latin classics and the text\r\nof Shakespeare. Heath in his lifetime divided a portion of his fine\r\nlibrary between two of his sons, but retained a large part of it. Dibdin\r\nin _Bibliomania_ prints an interesting letter, dated Exeter, March 21st,\r\n1738, from Heath to Mr. John Mann of the Hand in Hand Fire Office,\r\nLondon, asking him to superintend the purchase of some books at a sale\r\nwhich was shortly to take place, and appending a list of those he\r\ndesired, and the prices he was willing to pay for them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Drake, _Heathiana_. London, 1882.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE WALPOLE, FOURTH EARL OF ORFORD, 1717-1797\r\n\r\n\r\nHoratio or Horace Walpole, fourth Earl of Orford (he disliked the name\r\nHoratio, and wrote himself Horace), was the fourth and youngest son of\r\nSir Robert Walpole, first Earl of Orford, by his first wife, Catherine\r\nShorter, eldest daughter of John Shorter of Bybrook, near Ashford in\r\nKent. He was born, as he himself tells us, on the 24th of September 1717\r\nO.S. In 1727 he was sent to Eton, where he had for his schoolfellows the\r\nfuture poets Thomas Gray and Richard West; and eight years later he\r\nproceeded to King's College, Cambridge. Walpole entered the House of\r\nCommons in 1741 as Member for Callington in Cornwall, and afterwards sat\r\nfor the family boroughs of Castle Rising and King's Lynn, but although\r\nhe took a considerable interest in politics, public life was not\r\ncongenial to his pursuits and tastes, and in 1767 he resigned his seat\r\nin Parliament. In his earlier days he was a Whig with a strong leaning\r\nto republicanism, but the public events of his later years greatly\r\nmodified his views. It has been well said of him that 'he was an\r\naristocrat by instinct and a republican by caprice.' On the death of his\r\nnephew, George, the third Earl, in 1791, he succeeded to the earldom,\r\nbut he never took his seat in the House of Lords, and seldom signed his\r\nname as Orford. He died at his house in Berkeley Square on the 2nd of\r\nMarch 1797, and was buried at Houghton, the family seat in Norfolk.\r\n\r\nIn 1747 Walpole purchased the remainder of the lease of a small house\r\nwhich stood near the Thames 'just out of Twickenham,' popularly called\r\nChopped-Straw Hall, on account of its having been the residence of a\r\nretired coachman of an Earl of Bradford, who was supposed to have made\r\nhis money by starving his master's horses. On the 5th of June 1747\r\nWalpole writes to Sir Horace Mann, that although 'the house is so small\r\nthat I can send it to you in a letter to look at, the prospect is as\r\ndelightful as possible, commanding the river, the town (Twickenham), and\r\nRichmond Park, and being situated on a hill descends to the Thames\r\nthrough two or three little meadows, where I have some Turkish sheep and\r\ntwo cows, all studied in their colours for becoming the view.' This\r\ncottage grew into the Gothic mansion of Strawberry Hill, the erection\r\nand embellishment of which formed for so many years the principal\r\noccupation and amusement of Walpole's life. Here he collected works of\r\nart and curiosities of every kind--pictures, miniatures, prints and\r\ndrawings, armour, coins, and china, together with a fine library of\r\nabout fifteen thousand volumes, chiefly of antiquarian and historical\r\nsubjects. These he acquired with the emoluments of three sinecure\r\noffices which his father had obtained for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIGNETTE OF STRAWBERRY HILL. Used in books printed at\r\nWalpole's Press.]\r\n\r\nIn 1757 Walpole set up a printing-press in a small cottage adjoining his\r\nresidence, and this continued in use until his death in 1797. Gray's\r\n_Odes_, in a handsome quarto, was the first of a large number of works\r\nand fugitive pieces, many from his own pen, which issued from it. An\r\nexcellent account of the press, by Mr. H.B. Wheatley, F.S.A., will be\r\nfound in _Bibliographica_, vol. iii., pp. 83-98. Walpole was the author\r\nof many works, but his literary reputation now rests mainly on his\r\nletters. Mr. Austin Dobson, in his delightful Memoir of Walpole, says of\r\nthem that 'for diversity of interest and perpetual entertainment, for\r\nthe constant surprises of an unique species of wit, for happy and\r\nunexpected turns of phrase, for graphic characterisation and clever\r\nanecdote, for playfulness, pungency, irony, persiflage, there is nothing\r\nlike his letters in English.' A collected edition of his works, edited\r\nby Mary Berry, under the name of her father, Robert Berry, was published\r\nin 1798 in five volumes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the library formed by Walpole at Strawberry Hill consisted\r\nprincipally of works 'which no gentleman's library should be without,'\r\nit also contained some beautiful manuscripts, a goodly number of rare\r\nbooks of the Elizabethan and Jacobean times, and an immense collection\r\nof interesting papers and letters, prints and portraits. Many of the\r\nprints were by the great engravers of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and\r\nseventeenth centuries. The most notable of the manuscripts were a copy\r\nof the Psalms of David on vellum, with twenty-one illuminations\r\nattributed to Giulio Clovio; a magnificent 'Missal,' executed for\r\nClaude, Queen Consort of Francis I., King of France; and a folio volume\r\nof old English poetry, written on vellum, from the library of Ralph\r\nThoresby, the antiquary. Among the more important of the collections of\r\npapers and letters were those of Sir Julius Caesar, which contained\r\nletters of James I., Henry, Prince of Wales, the King and Queen of\r\nBohemia, and most of the leading nobility and gentry of the time of\r\nElizabeth and James I.; Sir Sackville Crowe's Book of Accounts of the\r\nPrivy Purse of the Duke of Buckingham in his different journeys into\r\nFrance, Spain, and the Low Countries with Prince Charles; the\r\nmanuscripts bequeathed to Walpole by Madame du Deffand, together with\r\nupwards of eight hundred letters addressed by her to him; and Vertue's\r\nmanuscripts in twenty-eight volumes. Sir Julius Caesar's travelling\r\nlibrary, consisting of forty-four duodecimo volumes, bound in white\r\nvellum, and enclosed in an oak case covered with light olive morocco,\r\nelegantly tooled, and made to resemble a folio volume (now in the\r\nBritish Museum); and the identical copy of Homer used by Pope for his\r\ntranslation, with the inscription, 'Finished ye translation in Feb.\r\n1719-20--A. Pope,' and containing a pencil sketch of Twickenham Church\r\nby the poet, were among the most interesting printed books in the\r\nlibrary. A remarkable and beautiful collection of about forty original\r\ndrawings, being portraits of Francis the First and Second of France, and\r\nthe members of their Courts, taken from life in pencil, tinted with red\r\nchalk, by Janet; Callot's Pocket Book, with drawings by this master; and\r\nfine collections of the works of Vertue and Hogarth also deserve to be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter Walpole's death Strawberry Hill and its contents passed to the\r\nHon. Mrs. Damer, the sculptress, daughter of his cousin, Field-Marshal\r\nConway, together with two thousand a year for its maintenance. After\r\nresiding in it for some time Mrs. Damer found the situation lonely, and\r\ngave up the house and property to the Countess Dowager Waldegrave, in\r\nwhom the fee was vested under Walpole's will. In 1842, George, seventh\r\nEarl Waldegrave, to whom Strawberry Hill had descended, ordered the\r\ncontents to be sold by George Robins, the well-known auctioneer. The\r\nsale was advertised to occupy twenty-four days, from April 25th to May\r\n21st. The catalogue was badly compiled, and so much dissatisfaction was\r\nexpressed at the intention of selling some of the collections _en\r\nmasse_, that the contents of the seventh and eighth days' sale, which\r\nconsisted of prints, drawings, and illustrated books, were withdrawn,\r\nre-catalogued, and disposed of at a sale at Robins's rooms at Covent\r\nGarden, which lasted from the 13th to the 23rd of June. The amount\r\nrealised at the sale at Strawberry Hill was twenty-nine thousand six\r\nhundred and twelve pounds, sixteen shillings and threepence; and at that\r\nin London, three thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven pounds, fifteen\r\nshillings and sixpence. The library, consisting of books, manuscripts,\r\nprints, etc., sold for about seven thousand seven hundred and forty\r\npounds. The copy of the Psalms, with illuminations ascribed to Giulio\r\nClovio, fetched four hundred and forty-one pounds; the volume of English\r\npoetry, two hundred and twenty pounds, ten shillings; the 'Missal'\r\nexecuted for Queen Claude, one hundred and fifteen pounds, ten\r\nshillings; and the manuscripts and letters of Madame du Deffand, one\r\nhundred and fifty-seven pounds, ten shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRALPH WILLETT, 1719-1795\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph Willett, the collector of the famous Merly Library, was born in\r\n1719. He was the elder son of Henry Willett, of the island of St.\r\nChristopher in the West Indies. In 1736 he matriculated at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford from Oriel College, but did not take a degree; and\r\nin 1739 he was admitted a student at Lincoln's Inn. Willett early\r\ndeveloped a taste for books and pictures, and his inheritance of the\r\nfamily estates in the West Indies, on the death of his father in 1740,\r\nenabled him to form splendid collections of them. In 1751 he purchased a\r\nproperty at Merly, near Wimborne, Dorsetshire, where in 1752 he built a\r\nnoble mansion, which later he enlarged by adding two wings, in one of\r\nwhich he constructed a handsome room for a library, which he ornamented\r\nwith frescoes and arabesque designs. A description of this library,\r\nwritten by Willett in English and French, was printed in 1776 in octavo,\r\nand reprinted in 1785 by John Nichols in a large folio volume, with\r\ntwenty-five illustrations of the designs. His London house was in Dean\r\nStreet, Soho. Willett was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries\r\nin 1763, and contributed two papers on _The Origin of Printing_ to the\r\n_Archaeologia_, which were reprinted at Newcastle in 1818-20; and a third\r\non _British Naval Architecture_. In 1764 he was also elected a Fellow of\r\nthe Royal Society. He died on the 13th of January 1795. Willett, who was\r\ntwice married, but left no issue, bequeathed his property to his cousin\r\nJohn Willett Adye, who took the name of Willett, and was M.P. for New\r\nRomney from 1796 to 1806. This gentleman, shortly before his death,\r\nwhich occurred on 26th of September 1815, parted with the collections\r\nwhich had been left to him. The pictures were sold by Peter Coxe and Co.\r\non May 31st, 1813, and two following days, and the books by Leigh and\r\nSotheby on December 6th, and sixteen following days. The same\r\nauctioneers also sold the botanical drawings, of which there was a large\r\nnumber, on the 20th and 21st of December; and the books of prints on the\r\n20th of February in the succeeding year. The books were disposed of in\r\ntwo thousand seven hundred and twenty lots, and realised thirteen\r\nthousand five hundred and eight pounds, four shillings. The sale\r\ncatalogue states that the library consisted of 'a most rare assemblage\r\nof the early printers, fine specimens of block-printing, old English\r\nchronicles, etc., in the finest preservation, likewise an extensive and\r\nmagnificent collection of books in every department of literature, from\r\nthe earliest period to the present time. All the books are in the finest\r\ncondition, many printed on vellum and on large paper, and bound in\r\nmorocco and russia leathers. Likewise a most splendid missal; and a very\r\nchoice selection of botanical drawings, by Van Huysum, Taylor, Brown,\r\nLee, etc.'\r\n\r\nThe block-books in the collection comprised a _Biblia Pauperum_, which\r\nrealised two hundred and fifty-seven pounds, five shillings; the first\r\nand another edition of the _Speculum Humanae Salvationis_, which sold for\r\nthree hundred and fifteen pounds and two hundred and fifty-two pounds;\r\nand the _Apocalypse of St. John_, which fetched forty-two pounds. There\r\nwere seven Caxtons--the first edition of the _Dictes or Sayings of the\r\nPhilosophers_, _Tully of Old Age_, the _Polychronicon_, the second\r\nedition of the _Game of the Chesse_, the _Confessio Amantis_, the second\r\nedition of the _Mirrour of the World_, and _Diverse Ghostly Matters_.\r\nThese realised altogether one thousand three hundred and eighteen\r\npounds, sixteen shillings; the _Dictes_ and the _Confessio Amantis_\r\nfetching the highest prices--three hundred and fifteen pounds, and two\r\nhundred and sixty-two pounds, ten shillings.\r\n\r\nSome of the many other notable books in the library, and the prices\r\nobtained for them, were a copy of the Mentz Psalter of 1459 on vellum,\r\nsixty-three pounds; _Rationale Divinorum Officiorum_ of Durandus (Mentz,\r\n1459), one hundred and five pounds; the _Catholicon_ of Joannes Balbus\r\n(Mentz, 1460), sixty pounds, eighteen shillings; the _Constitutiones_ of\r\nPope Clement V. (Mentz, 1460), sixty-six pounds, three shillings; Latin\r\nBible (Mentz, 1462), one hundred and five pounds; the _Officia_ of\r\nCicero (Mentz, 1465), seventy-three pounds, ten shillings; Latin Bible\r\non vellum (Venice, 1476), one hundred and sixty-eight pounds; _Rhetorica\r\nNova_, by Laurentius de Saona (St. Albans, 1480), seventy-nine pounds,\r\nsixteen shillings; a vellum copy of the first edition of Homer\r\n(Florence, 1488), eighty-eight pounds, four shillings; a nearly complete\r\nset of De Bry's collections in seven volumes, one hundred and twenty-six\r\npounds; and a large paper copy of Prynne's _Records_ in three volumes,\r\nLondon, 1665-70, one hundred and fifty-two pounds, five shillings. The\r\n'splendid' manuscript missal, specially mentioned in the sale catalogue,\r\nsold for one hundred and five pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. ANTHONY ASKEW, 1722-1774\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Anthony Askew, M.D., was born at Kendal, Westmoreland, in the year\r\n1722. His father was Dr. Adam Askew, an eminent physician of\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne. He received his education at Sedbergh School, the\r\nGrammar School of Newcastle, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He took\r\nthe degree of M.B. in 1745, and that of M.D. five years later. After\r\nleaving the University he went to Leyden, where he remained twelve\r\nmonths studying medicine, and then undertook an extensive tour on the\r\nContinent, during which he purchased a large number of valuable books\r\nand manuscripts. Dibdin says he was well known as a collector in most\r\nparts of Europe. In 1750, having finished his travels, Askew returned to\r\nCambridge, where he practised for some time as a physician. He\r\nafterwards removed to London, where, aided by the patronage and support\r\nof his friend Dr. Mead, he soon acquired a considerable reputation, but\r\nhe is better known as a scholar than a physician. Dr. Parr entertained a\r\nvery high opinion of his attainments in Greek and Roman literature.\r\nAskew was a Fellow and Registrar of the College of Physicians, and also\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society. He died at Hampstead on the 27th of\r\nFebruary 1774.\r\n\r\nDr. Askew was an indefatigable collector, and filled his house from the\r\nground floor to the attics with rare and handsomely bound books. The\r\nlibrary, which numbered about seven thousand volumes, was extremely rich\r\nin early editions of the Greek and Latin classics, and its owner was\r\nambitious that it should contain every edition of a Greek author. It\r\ncomprised the first editions of the _De Officiis_ of Cicero, the Natural\r\nHistory of Pliny, Cornelius Nepos, the History of Ammianus Marcellinus,\r\nthe Fables of AEsop, the Works of Plato, and of many other Greek and\r\nLatin writers; the greater number of them being printed on vellum. A\r\nvellum copy of the _Rationale_ of Durandus, printed by Fust and\r\nSchoeffer at Mentz in 1459; a first edition of the _Teseide_ of\r\nBoccaccio, printed on vellum at Ferrara in 1475; a copy of the _Greek\r\nAnthology_, also on vellum, printed at Florence in 1494; _Tully of Old\r\nAge_, printed by Caxton, and a fine vellum copy of the _Tewrdannck_,\r\nwere a few of the other notable books in the collection.\r\n\r\nThe printed books in the library were sold by Baker and Leigh at their\r\nauction rooms in York Street, Covent Garden, on the 13th of February\r\n1775, and the nineteen following days. The lots were three thousand five\r\nhundred and seventy in number, and realised three thousand nine hundred\r\nand ninety-three pounds and sixpence. Among the purchasers at the sale\r\nwere King George III., Louis XVI., King of France, Dr. Hunter and the\r\nRev. C.M. Cracherode. The British Museum also acquired a considerable\r\nnumber of the books. The manuscripts, and the printed books with\r\nmanuscript notes, were sold by Leigh and Sotheby in 1785. The sale took\r\nplace on March the 7th and the eight subsequent days. There were six\r\nhundred and thirty-three lots, which produced eighteen hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. C.M. CRACHERODE.]\r\n\r\nAskew was the author of a manuscript volume of Greek and Latin\r\nInscriptions, copied by him during his travels in Greece and the Levant.\r\nThe collection is preserved among the Burney Manuscripts in the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. C.M. CRACHERODE, 1730-1799\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, to whom the British Museum is\r\nindebted for some of its most precious collections, was the son of\r\nColonel Mordaunt Cracherode, who commanded the Marines in Anson's voyage\r\nround the world. He was born at Taplow in 1730, and was educated at\r\nWestminster and Christ Church, Oxford, taking the degree of B.A. in\r\n1750, and that of M.A. in 1753. After leaving the University he took\r\nholy orders, and for some time was curate of Binsey, near Oxford, but\r\nhe did not seek any preferment in the Church. On the death of his father\r\nhe inherited a fortune of about three thousand pounds a year, which\r\nenabled him to acquire a library of not less than four thousand five\r\nhundred volumes, remarkable for their rarity and beauty; seven\r\nportfolios of drawings by the great masters, and a hundred portfolios of\r\nprints, many of which were almost priceless; and in addition to these a\r\nsplendid collection of coins and gems, and a cabinet of minerals. Mr.\r\nCracherode, who never married, was a shy, retiring man, who lived\r\nentirely among his collections, and it is said that he never mounted a\r\nhorse, nor travelled a greater distance than from London to Oxford. One\r\ngreat drawback to the happiness of his quiet life was the dread that he\r\nmight possibly be called upon to officiate at a coronation as the King's\r\ncupbearer, as his manor of Great Wymondley was held from the Crown\r\nsubject to the performance of this duty. Dibdin, in his _Bibliographical\r\nDecameron_, says of him that he had 'a dash of the primitiveness of the\r\nold school about him, and that his manners were easy, polished and\r\nengaging. He was a thorough gentleman, and no mean scholar.' He devoted\r\nhis life to his favourite pursuit, the formation of his collections; and\r\nEdwards, in his _Lives of the Founders of the British Museum_, tells us\r\nthat--'For almost forty years it was his daily practice to walk from his\r\nhouse in Queen Square, Westminster, to the shop of Elmsly, a bookseller\r\nin the Strand, and thence to the still more noted shop of Tom Payne, by\r\nthe \"Mews-Gate.\" Once a week, he varied the daily walk by calling on\r\nMudge, a chronometer-maker, to get his watch regulated. His excursions\r\nhad, indeed, one other and not infrequent variety--dictated by the calls\r\nof Christian benevolence--but of these he took care to have no note\r\ntaken.... The ruling passion kept its strength to the last. An agent was\r\nbuying prints, for addition to the store, when the Collector was dying.\r\nAbout four days before his death, Mr. Cracherode mustered strength to\r\npay a farewell visit to the old shop at the Mews-Gate. He put a finely\r\nprinted _Terence_ (from the press of Foulis) into one pocket, and a\r\nlarge paper _Cebes_ into another; and then--with a longing look at a\r\ncertain choice _Homer_, in the course of which he mentally, and somewhat\r\ndoubtingly, balanced its charms with those of its twin brother in Queen\r\nSquare--parted finally from the daily haunt of forty peripatetic and\r\nstudious years.' Mr. Cracherode is also mentioned in the _Pursuits of\r\nLiterature_, by T.J. Mathias:--\r\n\r\n  'Or must I, as a wit, with learned air,\r\n  Like Doctor Dibdin, to Tom Payne's repair,\r\n  Meet Cyril Jackson and mild Cracherode there?\r\n  \"Hold!\" cries Tom Payne, \"that margin let me measure,\r\n  And rate the separate value of the treasure.\"\r\n  Eager they gaze. \"Well, Sirs, the feat is done.\r\n  Cracherode's _Poetae Principes_ have won.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Cracherode, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society\r\nof Antiquaries, and a Trustee of the British Museum, died at Queen\r\nSquare on the 5th of April 1799, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. He\r\nbequeathed the whole of his collections to the nation, with the\r\nexception of two books. A copy of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible was\r\ngiven to Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham, and a _princeps_ Homer,\r\nonce the property of De Thou, to Cyril Jackson, Dean of Christ Church;\r\nbut these volumes ultimately rejoined their former companions in the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nThe library formed by Mr. Cracherode is marvellously rich in choice\r\ncopies of rare and early editions of the classics; a large proportion of\r\nthem being printed on vellum. The volumes are almost always in faultless\r\ncondition, and beautifully bound. Many of them were once to be found in\r\nsuch renowned collections as those of Grolier, Maioli, Henry II. of\r\nFrance and Diana of Poitiers, Katharine de' Medici, De Thou,\r\nLongepierre, Count von Hoym, etc.; and have bindings by Nicolas and\r\nClovis Eve, Le Gascon, Padeloup, Derome, and Roger Payne. Among them are\r\nmagnificent copies of the editions of _Pliny_ printed at Venice by\r\nJoannes de Spira in 1469, and by Nicolas Jenson in 1476. The latter\r\nformerly belonged to Grolier, and the binding bears his well-known\r\nmotto. A copy of the first edition of _AEsop's Fables_, printed at Milan\r\nabout 1480, and a very beautiful example of the first edition of the\r\n_Greek Anthology_, on vellum, printed in capitals by Laurentius de Alopa\r\nat Florence in 1494, in the original binding, are also deserving of\r\nspecial notice. Other remarkable and interesting books are the _Greek\r\nGrammar_ of Lascaris, printed at Milan in 1476; the _Liber Psalmorum_,\r\nprinted at Milan in 1481; Maioli's copy of the _Hypnerotomachia\r\nPoliphili_, printed at Venice by Aldus in 1499; and a fine copy of\r\nPetrarch's _Sonetti e Canzoni_, on vellum, printed by Aldus in 1501,\r\nwhich formerly belonged to Isabella d'Este, wife of Gian-Francesco\r\nGonzaga, Marquis of Mantua. This was the first Italian book printed in\r\nitalic type.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMORIAL BOOK-STAMP OF THE REV. C.M. CRACHERODE.]\r\n\r\nThe library contains three Caxtons: _Boethius de Consolatione\r\nPhilosophiae_, the _Mirrour of the World_, and the _Boke of Eneydos_.\r\n\r\nA copy of Tyndale's New Testament on vellum, which once belonged to\r\nQueen Anne Boleyn, with her arms emblazoned on the title-page, and the\r\nwords 'Anna Regina Angliae' painted in gold on the edges of the leaves,\r\nand a handsome Shakespeare first folio, ought also to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. Cracherode's classical attainments were by no means inconsiderable,\r\nbut his only writings were a Latin poem printed in the _Carmina\r\nQuadragesimalia_ of 1748, and some Latin verses in the collection of the\r\nUniversity of Oxford on the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in\r\n1751.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Mr. Cracherode appears in Clarke's _Repertorium\r\nBibliographicum_, and in Dibdin's _Bibliographical Decameron_. This was\r\nengraved, contrary to his express wishes, from a drawing made by Edridge\r\nfor Lady Spencer. An explanation is given by Dr. Dibdin of the\r\ncircumstances under which the likeness was reproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN TOWNELEY, 1731-1813\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Towneley, who was born on the 15th of June 1731, and died on the\r\n13th of May 1813, was the younger son of Richard Towneley of Towneley,\r\nin the county of Lancaster, and Mary, daughter of William, Lord\r\nWiddrington. He married Barbara, fourth daughter of Edward Dicconson of\r\nWrightington, in the county of Lancaster, by whom he had a daughter,\r\nBarbara, who married Sir William Stanley, Bart., of Hooton, and a son,\r\nPeregrine Edward, who succeeded to the estates. Dibdin, in his\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_, informs us that 'Mr. Towneley had one of\r\nthe finest figures, as an elderly gentleman (for he died at 82), that\r\ncould possibly be seen. His stature was tall and frame robust; his gait\r\nwas firm; his countenance was Roman-like; his manners were conciliatory,\r\nand his language was unassuming. His habits were simple and perhaps\r\nsevere. He generally rose at five, and lighted his own library fire--and\r\nhis health was manifest in his person and countenance. He was entirely\r\nan unpretending man--and may be said to have collected rather from the\r\npleasure and reputation attached to such pursuits than from a thorough\r\nand keen relish of the kind of taste which it imparts. He had an ample\r\npurse, and it was most liberally unstrung when there was occasion for\r\neffectual aid. This observation may equally apply to matters out of the\r\n_bibliomaniacal_ record; but as a book-purchaser he was considered among\r\nthe most heavy-metalled and determined champions in the field.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe library formed by Mr. Towneley was a particularly good one, and it\r\nwas remarkable for the large number of rare and fine examples it\r\npossessed of books from the presses of Caxton, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde,\r\nJulian Notary, and other early English printers. No fewer than nine\r\nCaxtons were to be found on its shelves, and Pynson and Wynkyn de Worde\r\nwere especially well represented. Among the Caxtons were the first\r\nedition of the _Dictes or Sayings of the Philosophers_, the _Fayts of\r\nArms_, and _Troilus and Creside_, together with the _Life of St.\r\nKatherine_, published by Caxton's executors. Perhaps the most important\r\nof the other early English books were Boccaccio's _Falle of Princis_,\r\ntranslated by Lydgate, and Froissart's _Cronycle_, both printed by\r\nPynson; and the _Vitas Patrum_ and the _Kalender of Shepeherdes_ by\r\nWynkyn de Worde. The library also contained some exceedingly rare and\r\nvaluable manuscripts, of which some of the most notable were a famous\r\ncopy of the _Iliad_, a _Pontificale_ of Pope Innocent IV., and a very\r\ninteresting and curious collection of English Miracle-Plays acted at\r\nWakefield in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.[79] Of the copy of\r\nthe _Iliad_, Clarke in his _Repertorium Bibliographicum_ remarks:--'This\r\nis the identical manuscript which was formerly in the possession of\r\nVictorius and Salviati at Florence, the supposed loss of which had been\r\ndeplored for more than two centuries. Critics have unanimously assigned\r\nto it a very remote period of antiquity. It is written upon vellum in a\r\nvery fair and legible hand, and the margins are replete with most\r\nvaluable and important scholia. Heyne has given a facsimile of it in his\r\nHomer. It was purchased by the late Rev. Dr. Burney, whose entire\r\ncollection is now deposited in the British Museum.'\r\n\r\nTowneley's books were sold after his death, in three portions, by Evans\r\nof Pall Mall. The first sale took place on June 8th, 1814, and six\r\nfollowing days. It comprised nine hundred and five lots, which realised\r\nfive thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven pounds, four shillings. The\r\nsecond sale occurred on June 19th, 1815, and nine following days, and\r\nthe seventeen hundred and three lots in it fetched two thousand seven\r\nhundred and seven pounds, sixteen shillings. The third sale consisted\r\nonly of a few remaining books, which were disposed of in conjunction\r\nwith the library of Mr. Auditor Harley on May 22nd, 1817, and six\r\nfollowing days. Eleven hundred and twenty-seven pounds, two shillings\r\nwere obtained for the nine Caxtons; the _Troilus and Creside_, the _Life\r\nof St. Katherine_, and the _Dictes or Sayings of the Philosophers_\r\nfetching the highest prices, viz. two hundred and fifty-two pounds, two\r\nshillings, two hundred and thirty-one pounds, and one hundred and\r\neighty-nine pounds. Bochas's _Falle of Princis_ and Froissart's\r\n_Cronycle_ realised twenty-seven pounds, sixteen shillings and sixpence,\r\nand forty-two pounds; and the _Vitas Patrum_ and the _Kalender of\r\nShepeherdes_ fifty-three pounds, eleven shillings and nineteen pounds.\r\nEighty-five pounds were obtained for Henry Boece's _Hystory and\r\nCroniklis of Scotland_, translated by Bellenden, and printed by Davidson\r\nat Edinburgh in 1536; thirty-three pounds, sixteen shillings for\r\nRicraft's _Survey of England's Champions_, etc., London, 1647; and\r\nforty-eight pounds, six shillings for a Book of Hours printed on vellum\r\nby Julian Notary in 1503. Among the manuscripts the _Iliad_ sold for six\r\nhundred and twenty pounds, the Wakefield Miracle-Plays for one hundred\r\nand forty-seven pounds, and the _Pontificale Innocentii IV._ for one\r\nhundred and twenty-seven pounds, one shilling. The drawings, prints,\r\netc., belonging to Towneley were sold by King of 38 King Street, Covent\r\nGarden, in May 1816 for fourteen hundred and fourteen pounds, five\r\nshillings and sixpence; and his magnificent collection of Hollar's works\r\nwas disposed of by the same auctioneer for two thousand one hundred and\r\neight pounds, eleven shillings and sixpence in May 1818. John Towneley\r\nwas not the only collector of his family. Charles Towneley, his nephew,\r\nformed a celebrated collection of marbles, coins, gems, and drawings,\r\nnow in the British Museum; and Christopher Towneley, who was born in\r\n1604 and died in 1674, was the collector of many of the old manuscripts\r\ndisposed of in the second sale of the Towneley library which occurred in\r\n1883 after the death of Colonel John Towneley, when in default of a male\r\nheir the estates devolved on his daughters and those of his elder\r\nbrother, Colonel Charles Towneley.\r\n\r\nThe second sale of the Towneley library took place in June 1883. The\r\nprinted books were sold on the 18th and seven following days, and the\r\nmanuscripts on the 27th and following day, by Sotheby, Wilkinson and\r\nHodge. There were two thousand eight hundred and fifteen lots of printed\r\nbooks, which realised four thousand six hundred and sixteen pounds,\r\nthree shillings; and two hundred and fifty-one lots of manuscripts, for\r\nwhich the sum of four thousand and fifty-four pounds, six shillings and\r\nsixpence was obtained. Among the printed books the very rare _York\r\nManual_, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1509; the _Pilgrymage of\r\nPerfection_ of 1531, by the same printer, with the Towneley arms worked\r\nin silver on the covers of the binding; and a large paper copy of\r\nNichols's _History and Antiquities of the County of Leicester_, in eight\r\nvolumes, were the most deserving of special notice. These sold\r\nrespectively for fifty-nine pounds, twenty-seven pounds, ten shillings,\r\nand two hundred and thirty-five pounds. The two principal manuscripts in\r\nthe sale were a _Vita Christi_, beautifully illuminated by Giulio Clovio\r\nfor Alexander, Cardinal Farnese, for which Mr. Quaritch gave two\r\nthousand and fifty pounds, and the collection of Wakefield Plays, which\r\nwas also purchased by the same great bookseller for six hundred and\r\ntwenty pounds.[80]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: These plays were printed for the Surtees Society in 1836,\r\nand re-edited by George England, with side-notes and introduction by\r\nAlfred W. Pollard, M.A., in 1897, for the Early English Text Society.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: This collection was re-purchased for the Towneley library\r\nat the sale of Mr. North's books in May 1819 for ninety-four pounds, ten\r\nshillings.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN THOROLD, BART., 1734-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nSir John Thorold, Bart., of Syston Park, Grantham, Lincolnshire, who was\r\nborn in 1734, and succeeded his father, Sir John Thorold, eighth\r\nbaronet, in 1775, was one of the most ardent collectors of his time. The\r\nmagnificent library which he and his son Sir John Hayford Thorold formed\r\nat Syston Park contained some of the rarest incunabula in existence.\r\nAmong them were copies of the Gutenberg Bible; the Second Mentz Psalter\r\non vellum; the _Catholicon_ of 1460; the Latin Bible of 1462, with the\r\narms and cypher of Prince Eugene on the binding; and the _Mirrour of the\r\nWorld_, printed by Caxton in 1481. It also possessed one of the earliest\r\nof the block-books, the _Apocalypse_. The library was extremely rich in\r\nfirst editions of the Greek and Latin classics, some of them on vellum.\r\nOther choice and rare books in the collection were a copy of the Greek\r\nBible, printed 'in aedibus Aldi' in 1518, described by Dibdin as 'the\r\nlargest and finest copy I ever saw'; the Polyglot Bible of Cardinal\r\nXimenez; the first edition of the _Tewrdannck_; the four Shakespeare\r\nfolios; _Purchas his Pilgrimmes_; and the _Pastissier Francois_, printed\r\nby L. and D. Elzevier at Amsterdam in 1655. There were also many\r\neditions of _Horae_ and _Officia_ of the Virgin Mary, mostly printed on\r\nvellum. Several of the Syston Park books once formed part of the famous\r\nlibraries of Grolier, Maioli, Diana of Poitiers, Katharine de' Medicis,\r\nCount von Hoym, Prince Eugene, and Sir Kenelm Digby. The collection also\r\npossessed a number of the beautiful little volumes bound by Clovis Eve,\r\nwhich were once thought to have formed part of the library of Marguerite\r\nde Valois, but are now believed to have belonged to that of Marie\r\nMarguerite de Valois de Saint-Remy, daughter of a natural son of Henry\r\nIII., King of France. After the death of Sir John Thorold on the 25th of\r\nFebruary 1815, his son and successor Sir John Hayford Thorold, having\r\nfirst sold the duplicates in the library, made many additions to it. He\r\ndied on the 7th of July 1831, and fifty-three years later a portion of\r\nthe books was sold by auction by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. The sale,\r\nwhich took place on December 12th, 1884, and seven following days,\r\nconsisted of two thousand one hundred and ten lots, which realised the\r\nlarge sum of twenty-eight thousand and one pounds, fifteen shillings and\r\nsixpence. For some of the rarest of the books very large prices were\r\nobtained. Mr. Quaritch acquired the Gutenberg Bible for three thousand\r\nnine hundred pounds, and the Mentz Psalter for four thousand nine\r\nhundred and fifty. _The Catholicon_ sold for four hundred pounds, the\r\n1462 Latin Bible for one thousand pounds, _The Mirrour of the World_\r\nfor three hundred and thirty-five pounds, the Aldine Greek Bible for\r\nfifty-one pounds, and the first Shakespeare folio for five hundred and\r\nninety pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. RICHARD FARMER, D.D., 1735-1797\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Richard Farmer, D.D., was born at Leicester on the 28th of\r\nAugust 1735. He was the second son of Richard Farmer, a wealthy maltster\r\nof that town. After receiving his early education in the Free Grammar\r\nSchool of his native place, he was entered in 1753 as a pensioner of\r\nEmmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1757 and M.A. in\r\n1760. In the latter year he was appointed classical tutor of his\r\nCollege; which post he held until his election to the Mastership in\r\n1775, when he took the degree of D.D. He served the office of\r\nVice-Chancellor of the University in 1775-76 and again in 1787-88, and\r\non the 27th of June 1778 was chosen the Chief Librarian of the\r\nUniversity. In 1780 he was collated to a prebendal stall at Lichfield,\r\nand two years later became Prebendary of Canterbury, which he resigned\r\nin 1788 on being preferred to a residentiary canonry of St. Paul's\r\nCathedral, London. It is said that he twice refused a bishopric which\r\nwas offered to him rather than forgo the pleasure of witnessing dramatic\r\nperformances on the stage. He died on the 8th of September 1797, at the\r\nLodge, Emmanuel College, and was buried in the chapel. A monument, with\r\nan epitaph by Dr. Parr, was erected to his memory in the cloisters.\r\n\r\nDr. Farmer, who was an elegant scholar and a zealous antiquary, was\r\nsomewhat eccentric both in his appearance and manners. It is said of him\r\n'that there were three things he loved above all others, namely, old\r\nport, old clothes, and old books; and three things which nobody could\r\npersuade him to do, namely, to rise in the morning, to go to bed at\r\nnight, and to settle an account.[81] His reluctance to settle his\r\naccounts, however, was not caused by avarice, but indolence, for he\r\nspent a considerable portion of his large income in the relief of\r\ndistress, and in assisting in the publication of literary works; while\r\nhis pupils frequently borrowed of him sums of money, well knowing there\r\nwould be but little chance of a demand for repayment. Dr. Parr, who was\r\none of Farmer's intimate friends, remarked of him 'that his munificence\r\nwas without ostentation, his wit without acrimony, and his learning\r\nwithout pedantry.' Farmer was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries. His only published work was an _Essay on the\r\nLearning of Shakespeare_, which appeared in 1767 and went through four\r\neditions, besides being prefixed to several issues of Shakespeare's\r\nplays.\r\n\r\nDr. Farmer possessed a well-chosen library, which was rich in old\r\nEnglish poetry and plays. He himself said of it 'that not many private\r\ncollections contain a greater number of really curious and scarce books;\r\nand perhaps no one is so rich in the ancient philological English\r\nliterature; but Dibdin tells us that the volumes 'were, in general, in\r\nsorry condition; the possessor caring little for large margins and\r\nsplendid binding.' The collection was sold by auction by Mr. King, of\r\nKing Street, Covent Garden, on May 7th, 1798, and the thirty-five\r\nfollowing days. The catalogue, of which a priced copy is in the British\r\nMuseum, contains three hundred and seventy-nine pages, and the lots,\r\nincluding a few pictures, number eight thousand one hundred and\r\nfifty-five. The sale realised two thousand two hundred and ten pounds, a\r\nsum said to be greatly in excess of that which Farmer gave for his\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThere is a portrait of Dr. Farmer by Romney in Emmanuel College, which\r\nhas been engraved by J. Jones.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Dictionary of National Biography._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD GOUGH, 1735-1809\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Gough, the eminent antiquary, was the only son of Harry Gough,\r\nof Perry Hall, Staffordshire. He was born in Winchester Street, London,\r\non the 21st of October 1735, and was privately educated until about\r\nseventeen years of age, when he was admitted a fellow-commoner of Benet\r\n(now Corpus Christi) College, Cambridge. He left the University in 1756\r\nwithout taking a degree, and commenced a series of antiquarian\r\nexcursions into various parts of the kingdom for the purpose of\r\nobtaining information for an enlarged edition of Camden's _Britannia_,\r\nwhich he published in London in 1789. In 1767 Gough was elected a Fellow\r\nof the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1771, on the death of Dr. Gregory\r\nSharpe, Master of the Temple, was nominated Director, a post he held\r\nuntil 1797, when he left the Society altogether. He was also chosen a\r\nFellow of the Royal Society in 1775, but resigned in 1795. He died at\r\nEnfield on the 20th of February 1809, and was buried in the churchyard\r\nof Wormley, Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\nGough wrote, and assisted in the production of numerous topographical\r\nand antiquarian works, and contributed many articles to the\r\n_Archaeologia_ and the _Vetusta Monumenta_ of the Society of Antiquaries.\r\nA history of that institution by him is prefixed to the first volume of\r\nthe first-named publication. The _Gentleman's Magazine_ also contains\r\nmany papers and reviews from his pen. In addition to his edition of\r\nCamden's _Britannia_, which occupied seven years in translating and in\r\nprinting, his more important works are _Anecdotes of British\r\nTopography_, published at London in 1768, which was afterwards enlarged\r\nand reprinted in 1780 under the title of _British Topography: or an\r\nhistorical Account of what has been done for illustrating the\r\nTopographical Antiquities of Great Britain and Ireland_; and _The\r\nSepulchral Monuments of Great Britain_, London, 1786-99.\r\n\r\nGough possessed a considerable fortune, which enabled him to form an\r\nextensive library, as well as a fine collection of maps, drawings,\r\nprints, coins, and other antiquities. He left to the Bodleian Library\r\n'all his topographical collections, together with all his books relating\r\nto Saxon and Northern literature, for the use of the Saxon Professor,\r\nhis maps and engravings, and all the copper-plates used in the\r\nillustration of the various works published by himself.[82] This\r\ncollection, which numbered upwards of three thousand seven hundred\r\nvolumes, was placed, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will,\r\nin 'The Antiquaries' Closet,' with the collections of Dodsworth,\r\nTanner, Willis, and other antiquaries. Gough also gave to the library a\r\nsplendid series of early printed Service-books of the English Church,\r\namong which is a beautiful vellum copy of the _Hereford Missal_, printed\r\nat Rouen in 1502, and which is believed to be unique. A catalogue of the\r\ncollection was published by Dr. Bandinel in 1814. Gough bequeathed to\r\nMr. John Nichols his interleaved set of the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and\r\nof the _Anecdotes of Mr. Bowyer_.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his books, prints, and drawings, together with his\r\ncoins, medals, and other antiquities, were sold, according to his\r\ndirections, by auction by Leigh and Sotheby in 1810. The books realised\r\nthree thousand five hundred and fifty-two pounds, and the prints,\r\ndrawings, coins, medals, etc., five hundred and seventeen pounds more.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE STEEVENS, 1736-1800\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Steevens, the Shakesperian commentator, who was born on the 10th\r\nof May 1736, was the only son of George Steevens of Stepney, for many\r\nyears an East India captain, and afterwards a Director of the East India\r\nCompany. He received his early education at a school at\r\nKingston-on-Thames and at Eton. In 1753 he was admitted a\r\nfellow-commoner of King's College, Cambridge, but left the University\r\nwithout taking a degree. In 1766 he published a reprint in four octavo\r\nvolumes of _Twenty of the Plays of Shakespeare, being the whole number\r\nprinted in quarto during his Lifetime, etc._; and in 1773 he brought\r\nout, in association with Dr. Johnson, an edition of the whole of\r\nShakespeare's dramatic works. Steevens, who was a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety, and of the Society of Antiquaries, died unmarried at Hampstead\r\non the 22nd of January 1800, and was buried in the chapel at Poplar,\r\nwhere a monument by Flaxman was erected to his memory.\r\n\r\nSteevens collected a fine library, which was very rich in early English\r\npoetry and in the plays and poems of Shakespeare. It contained the first\r\nand second folios of the great dramatist, and upwards of forty copies of\r\nthe separate plays in quarto, many of them being first editions. The\r\nsecond folio formerly belonged to King Charles I., and was given by him\r\non the night before his execution to Sir Thomas Herbert, his Groom of\r\nthe Bedchamber. This very interesting volume, in which the King has\r\nwritten 'Dum spiro spero C.R.,' was bought at the sale of Steevens's\r\nbooks for King George III. for eighteen guineas, and is now preserved in\r\nthe Royal Library at Windsor. The collection also comprised some rare\r\nplays of Peele, Marlowe, and Nash; Barnabe Googe's _Eglogs, Epytaphes\r\nand Sonnettes_; Puttenham's _Arte of English Poesie_, London, 1589;\r\nSkelton's _Lyttle Workes and Merie Tales_; Watson's _Passionate Centurie\r\nof Love_; _England's Helicon_, collected by John Bodenham, London, 1600;\r\nBreton's _Workes of a young Wyt_; _The Paradice of Dainty Devises_,\r\nLondon, 1595; _XII Mery fests of the Wyddow Edyth_, London, 1573; and\r\nmany other scarce and choice books.\r\n\r\nSteevens's library was sold by auction by Mr. King at his great room,\r\nKing Street, Covent Garden, on May 13th, 1800, and ten following days.\r\nThe catalogue contained nineteen hundred and forty-three lots, which\r\nrealised two thousand seven hundred and forty pounds, fifteen shillings.\r\nA copy of the catalogue marked with the prices of the books and the\r\nnames of the purchasers is preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dibdin considered that 'enormous sums were given for some\r\nvolumes that cost Steevens not a twentieth part of their produce,' the\r\nprices were very small compared with those which could be obtained for\r\nthe same books at the present time. The first folio of Shakespeare's\r\nworks fetched only twenty-two pounds, and Charles I.'s copy of the\r\nsecond folio, as already mentioned, but eighteen guineas. Of the first\r\neditions of the separate quarto plays, _Othello_ sold for twenty-nine\r\npounds, eight shillings; _King Lear_ and the _Merry Wives of Windsor_\r\nfor twenty-eight pounds each; _Henry the Fifth_ for twenty-seven pounds,\r\nsix shillings; _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ for twenty-five pounds, ten\r\nshillings; and _Much Ado about Nothing_ for the same sum. The first\r\nedition of Shakespeare's _Sonnets_ went for three pounds, nineteen\r\nshillings. Steevens's copies of the _Merry Wives of Windsor_ and the\r\n_Sonnets_ fetched respectively three hundred and thirty guineas and two\r\nhundred and fifteen guineas at the sale of the library of George Daniel\r\nin 1864. Other prices obtained for some of the rare books were eleven\r\npounds, fifteen shillings for _England's Helicon_; ten pounds, fifteen\r\nshillings for Barnabe Googe's _Eglogs, Epytaphes and Sonnettes_; and\r\nseven pounds, ten shillings for Puttenham's _Arte of English Poesie_.\r\n\r\nSteevens, who led a very retired life in his house at Hampstead Heath,\r\nwas the reverse of an amiable man; and while he was very polite and\r\ncourteous to his literary friends in private, he made bitter attacks\r\nupon them in print. Dibdin says of him that 'his habits were indeed\r\npeculiar: not much to be envied or imitated; as they sometimes betrayed\r\nthe flights of a madman, and sometimes the asperities of a cynic. His\r\nattachments were warm, but fickle both in choice and duration. He would\r\nfrequently part from one, with whom he had lived on terms of close\r\nintimacy, without any assignable cause; and his enmities, once fixed,\r\nwere immovable.' Dr. Parr said of him that 'he was one of the wisest,\r\nmost learned, but most spiteful of men.' Dr. Johnson, however, thought\r\n'he was mischievous, but not malignant.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES BINDLEY, 1737-1818\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. James Bindley was the second son of Mr. John Bindley, distiller, of\r\nSt. John's Street, Smithfield. He was born in London on the 16th of\r\nJanuary 1737, and was educated at the Charterhouse, from whence he\r\nproceeded to Peterhouse, Cambridge, taking the degree of B.A. in 1759,\r\nand that of M.A. in 1762. Later he became a Fellow of his College. In\r\n1765, through the interest of his elder brother John, he was appointed\r\none of the Commissioners of the Stamp Duties, and in 1781 rose to be the\r\nSenior Commissioner, a post he held until his death, which occurred at\r\nhis apartments in Somerset House on the 11th of September 1818. He was a\r\nFellow of the Society of Antiquaries for upwards of fifty-three years. A\r\nhandsome monument to his memory was erected in the church of St.\r\nMary-le-Strand. Bindley formed a very large and valuable collection of\r\nrare books, engravings, and medals, which he commenced at a very early\r\nage, and to which he devoted all his spare time and money. When only\r\nfifteen years of age he constantly frequented the book-shops, where he\r\nbought everything which he considered rare or curious. He was a man of\r\nvery regular and retired habits, and it is said of him, that during the\r\nlong period he held the appointment of Commissioner of the Stamp Duties,\r\n'he never once failed in his daily attendance at the Board, or once\r\nslept out of his own apartments since he left his house at Finchley to\r\nreside in Somerset House.'[83] Bindley published in 1775 _A Collection\r\nof the Statutes now in force relating to the Stamp Duties_; and he read\r\nall the proof-sheets of Nichols's _Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nwhich are dedicated to him, and also of the early volumes of _The\r\nIllustrations of the Literary History of the Eighteenth Century_, by the\r\nsame author. He performed the same work for the _Memoirs of John\r\nEvelyn_, edited by William Bray in 1818.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBindley's library was a remarkably fine one, and few collections have\r\ncontained a larger number of works of early English literature,\r\nespecially of those of the time of Elizabeth and James I. Many of these\r\nbooks were excessively rare, and some of them unique. Among them were\r\nthe _Venus and Adonis_ of Shakespeare, printed in 1602; his _Poems_\r\nprinted in 1640, and several of the first editions of his separate plays\r\nin quarto. The library also comprised a large portion of the\r\nextraordinary collection of poetical sheets, consisting of ballads,\r\nsatires, elegies, etc., formed by Narcissus Luttrell, who, Sir Walter\r\nScott says, 'seems to have bought every poetical tract, of whatever\r\nmerit, which was hawked about the streets in his time, marking carefully\r\nthe price and date of the purchase.'\r\n\r\nAfter Bindley's death his books were sent to Evans of Pall Mall for\r\nsale. They were disposed of in five portions. The first sale took place\r\nin December 1818, and the fifth, which consisted of omissions, in\r\nJanuary 1821. There were nine thousand three hundred and eighty-three\r\nlots in the five sales, which occupied forty-six days, and realised\r\nupwards of seventeen thousand five hundred pounds. The following are a\r\nfew of the more notable books, and the prices they fetched in the\r\nsales:--_The Temple of Glasse_, printed by Berthelet, forty-six pounds,\r\nfour shillings; Chute's _Beawtie Dishonoured_ (London, 1529)--Steevens's\r\ncopy, thirty-four pounds; Lewicke's _Titus and Gisippus_ (London, 1562),\r\ntwenty-four pounds, thirteen shillings and sixpence; Parker, _De\r\nAntiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae_ (London, 1572), forty-five pounds,\r\nthree shillings; Nicolas Breton's _Floorish upon Fancie_ (London, 1577),\r\nforty-two pounds; Hunnis's _Hyve full of Hunnye_ (London, 1578),\r\neighteen guineas; _The Forrest of Fancy_ (London, 1579), thirty-eight\r\npounds, six shillings and sixpence; Markham's _Tragedie of Sir Richard\r\nGrinvile_ (London, 1595), forty pounds, nineteen shillings; Robert\r\nFletcher's _Nine English Worthies_ (London, 1606), thirty-seven pounds,\r\nsixteen shillings; Dolarny's _Primerose_ (London, 1606), twenty-six\r\npounds, ten shillings; and Purchas's _Pilgrimes_, five volumes (London,\r\n1625), thirty-four pounds, thirteen shillings. The first edition of\r\n_Othello_ sold for fifty-six pounds, fourteen shillings; of _Love's\r\nLabour Lost_ for forty pounds, ten shillings; and the _Venus and Adonis_\r\nof 1602 for forty-two pounds. Seven hundred and eighty-one pounds, one\r\nshilling were obtained for the Luttrell collection of poetical sheets;\r\nand fifty-two pounds, ten shillings for a little _Manual of Devotions_,\r\none inch and seven-eighths long, and one inch and three-eighths broad,\r\nwritten on vellum, and bound in gold, said to have been given by Anne\r\nBoleyn on the scaffold to her Maid of Honour, Mistress Wyatt.\r\n\r\nBindley's portraits, prints, drawings, and medals were sold by Leigh and\r\nSotheby in 1819, and realised seven thousand six hundred and ninety-two\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Gentleman's Magazine_, vol. lxxviii. part ii. p. 631.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PETTY FITZMAURICE, FIRST MARQUIS OF LANSDOWNE, 1737-1805\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Petty Fitzmaurice, third Earl of Shelburne and first Marquis of\r\nLansdowne, was born in Dublin on the 2nd of May 1737. He was first\r\nprivately educated, and afterwards at Christ Church, Oxford, which he\r\nleft early to take a commission in the Guards. He served with the\r\nBritish troops under Prince Ferdinand in Germany, and was present at the\r\nbattles of Kampen and Minden, where he distinguished himself by his\r\npersonal valour. He became a Major-General in 1765. In May 1760, and\r\nagain in April 1761, he was elected member for Wycombe, but he sat for a\r\nshort time only in the House of Commons, as the death of his father on\r\nthe 10th of May 1761 called him to the House of Lords. In April 1763 he\r\nwas placed at the head of the Board of Trade and Plantations, a post\r\nwhich he held only till September in the same year; but in 1766, when\r\nPitt, Earl of Chatham, formed his second administration, he included\r\nLord Shelburne in it as Secretary of State for the Southern Department,\r\nto which, at that time, the Colonial business was attached. From this\r\npost, however, he was dismissed in October 1768 by the Duke of Grafton,\r\nwhose influence in the Cabinet became paramount when the Earl of\r\nChatham's illness prevented him taking an active share in the\r\ngovernment. Lord Shelburne remained out of office until March 1782, when\r\non the formation of the Rockingham administration he became Secretary of\r\nState for Foreign Affairs. This ministry was dissolved on the death of\r\nLord Rockingham on the 1st of July in the same year, and the King\r\nentrusted Lord Shelburne with the construction of a new one, which\r\nlasted but little over seven months, as it was defeated in February 1783\r\nby the vote of the Fox and North coalition. Shortly after his\r\nretirement he was created Earl Wycombe and Marquis of Lansdowne. Lord\r\nLansdowne did not again accept office, but devoted himself to the\r\naugmentation of his fine library, the formation of which had occupied\r\nhis attention for many years. It was especially rich in historical and\r\npolitical manuscripts, and comprised, among other collections, one\r\nhundred and twenty-one volumes of the papers and miscellaneous\r\ncorrespondence of Lord Burghley, including his private note-book and\r\njournal, which had formerly been in the hands of Strype the historian.\r\nThe library also contained a considerable portion of the important\r\ncollection of State papers amassed by Sir Julius Caesar, Master of the\r\nRolls in the reign of James I.; the historical collections of White\r\nKennet, Bishop of Peterborough, which amounted to a hundred and seven\r\nvolumes, many of them being in the bishop's handwriting; the heraldic\r\nand genealogical collections of Segar, St. George, Dugdale, Le Neve, and\r\nother heralds; and some valuable legal, topographical, musical, biblical\r\nand classical manuscripts. The collection of manuscripts, which amounted\r\nto one thousand two hundred and forty-five volumes, was acquired in 1807\r\nby the Trustees of the British Museum for the sum of four thousand nine\r\nhundred and twenty-five pounds. The printed books, among which were many\r\nvaluable topographical works and some rare volumes of English\r\nliterature, numbered about twenty thousand. They were sold by Leigh and\r\nSotheby in 1806, and together with the maps, charts, books of prints,\r\netc., realised over eight thousand three hundred and fifty pounds. The\r\nMarquis, who collected pictures and sculpture as well as books, died on\r\nthe 7th of May 1805, at the age of sixty-eight, and was succeeded by his\r\nson John Henry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPHAM BEAUCLERK, 1739-1780\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Topham Beauclerk was the only son of Lord Sydney\r\nBeauclerk, and a grandson of the first Duke of St. Albans. He was born\r\nin 1739, and on the death of his father in 1744 succeeded to the estates\r\nwhich Lord Sydney had inherited from Mr. Richard Topham, M.P. for\r\nWindsor. In 1757 Beauclerk matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, but\r\nseems to have left the University without taking a degree. While he was\r\nat Oxford he made the acquaintance of Dr. Johnson, who appears to have\r\nbeen greatly attracted to him on account of his wit and conversation.\r\nThis intimacy surprised many of Johnson's friends, for although\r\nBeauclerk valued science and literature, he was also gay and dissipated.\r\n'What a coalition,' said Garrick, when he heard of it, 'I shall have my\r\nold friend to bail out of the Round-house.' Notwithstanding somewhat\r\nfrequent squabbles, the friendship lasted for upwards of twenty years,\r\nand on Beauclerk's death Johnson remarked of him--'that Beauclerk's\r\ntalents were those which he had felt himself more disposed to envy, than\r\nthose of any whom he had known.'[84] His conversational powers were\r\nevidently of a very high order, for Dr. Barnard, Bishop of Limerick, in\r\nhis well-known lines on Dr. Johnson, writes of him:\r\n\r\n  'If I have thoughts, and can't express 'em,\r\n  Gibbon shall teach me how to dress 'em\r\n  In terms select and terse;\r\n  Jones teach me modesty and Greek;\r\n  Smith, how to think; Burke, how to speak;\r\n  And Beauclerk to converse.'\r\n\r\nBeauclerk married on the 12th of March 1768 Lady Diana Spencer, eldest\r\ndaughter of the second Duke of Marlborough, two days after her divorce\r\nfrom Lord Bolingbroke and St. John. He died at Great Russell Street,\r\nBloomsbury, on the 11th of March 1780, leaving one son and two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nBeauclerk possessed a fine library of upwards of thirty thousand\r\nvolumes, which he kept at his residence at Muswell Hill, near London,\r\nstored, as Horace Walpole informs us, 'in a building that reaches\r\nhalf-way to Highgate.' It did not contain many rare books, but it was\r\nrich in works relating to natural history, voyages and travels, and\r\nEnglish and French plays; and Dibdin says that it was also valuable to\r\nthe general scholar, and to the collector of English antiquities and\r\nhistory. It also possessed a few curious and choice manuscripts. Some of\r\nthe books appear to have belonged to Mr. Topham, but most of them were\r\ncollected by Beauclerk. After his death they were sold by auction by Mr.\r\nPaterson 'at the Great Room, heretofore held by the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of Arts and Manufactures, opposite Beaufort Buildings, in\r\nthe Strand, London,' on Monday, April 9th, 1781, and the forty-nine\r\nfollowing days. A priced copy of the catalogue is in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nBeauclerk, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society, was a collector of\r\nnatural curiosities, as well as books, and botany was one of his\r\nfavourite studies. He had also an observatory at Muswell Hill.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Boswell, _Life of Johnson_ (London, 1811), vol. iii. p.\r\n460.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. BENJAMIN HEATH, D.D., 1739-1817\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. BENJAMIN HEATH, D.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Benjamin Heath, D.D., one of the sons to whom Mr. Benjamin\r\nHeath gave a part of his books, was born on the 29th of September 1739.\r\nHe was educated at Eton and at King's College, Cambridge, of which\r\nCollege he became a Fellow. After leaving the University he was\r\nappointed an assistant master at Eton, and in 1771 succeeded Dr. Sumner\r\nas headmaster of Harrow, a post he held for fourteen years.[85] He died\r\non the 31st of May 1817, at the rectory of Walkerne in the county of\r\nHertford, a living given to him by his College, which he held with the\r\nrectory of Farnham in Buckinghamshire. He was buried at Exeter. Dr.\r\nHeath, who was 'a scholar and a bibliomaniac,' added greatly to the\r\nlibrary given to him by his father, for which he built a large room at\r\nWalkerne, where, says Dibdin, 'he saw, entertained, and caressed his\r\nfriends, with Alduses in the forenoon, and with a cheerful glass towards\r\nevening, hospitable, temperate, kind-hearted, with a well furnished mind\r\nand purse, and with a larder and cellar which might have supplied\r\nmaterials for a new edition of Pynson's _Royal Boke of Cookery and\r\nKervinge_, 1500, 4to.'[86] Some years before his death Heath offered his\r\nbooks to King's College, Cambridge, for half the sum they had cost him;\r\nbut the College authorities declined the purchase, and he then sold the\r\nprincipal portion of them to some private individuals, who, Dibdin\r\nbelieves, were Messrs. Cuthell and Martin, for three thousand pounds\r\nbeneath the sum they ultimately produced,[87] and they instructed Mr.\r\nJeffery of 11 Pall Mall to sell the books by auction. The sale took\r\nplace on Thursday, the 5th of April 1810, and twelve following days and\r\nWednesday, May 2nd, and eighteen following days. It consisted of four\r\nthousand seven hundred and eighty-six lots, which realised eight\r\nthousand eight hundred and ninety-nine pounds. The sale catalogue states\r\nthat the library consisted of 'rare, useful and valuable publications in\r\nevery department of literature, from the first invention of printing to\r\nthe present time, all of which are in the most perfect condition.'\r\nAnother catalogue, with the prices and purchasers' names, of which it is\r\nsaid only two hundred and fifty copies were printed, was published later\r\nin the year by Constable of Edinburgh. Both the catalogues are to be\r\nfound in the Library of King George III. in the British Museum.\r\nDibdin describes this sale in enthusiastic terms in his\r\n_Bibliomania_:--'Never,' he writes, 'did the bibliomaniac's eye alight\r\nupon \"sweeter copies\"--as the phrase is; and never did the\r\nbibliomaniacal barometer rise higher than at this sale! The most marked\r\nphrensy characterized it. A copy of the Editio Princeps of Homer (by no\r\nmeans a first-rate one) brought L92:[88] and all the ALDINE CLASSICS\r\nproduced such an electricity of sensation that buyers stuck at nothing\r\nto embrace them!'[89]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Dibdin, _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. iii. p. 368.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Dibdin, _Bibliographical Decameron_, vol. iii. p. 369.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Ibid._, iii. 370.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAJOR THOMAS PEARSON, 1740?-1781\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Thomas Pearson was born about the year 1740 at Cote Green, near\r\nBurton-in-Kendal, Westmoreland. He was educated at Burton, and came to\r\nLondon about 1756 to fill a post in the Navy Office, which he resigned\r\nin 1760. In the course of the following year he left England, having\r\nobtained a cadetship on the Bengal Establishment, in which he rose to\r\nthe rank of Major. He distinguished himself on several occasions, and\r\nwas particularly noticed by Lord Clive, to whom he adhered during the\r\nmutiny fomented by Sir Robert Fletcher, at whose trial he held the\r\noffice of Judge Advocate. In 1767 Pearson married a sister of Eyles\r\nIrwin, the traveller and writer. This lady died in the following year,\r\nand an epitaph inscribed to her memory may be found, together with other\r\npoetical pieces by Pearson, in vol. iv. of Pearch's _Collection of\r\nPoems_. Pearson returned to England in August 1770 with Governor\r\nVerelst, under whom he had acted as Military Secretary, and built a\r\nhouse for himself at Burton, in which he collected a very extensive\r\nlibrary, consisting of works on the history, antiquities, topography,\r\nand heraldry of Great Britain and Ireland, foreign history, voyages and\r\ntravels, natural history, etc., but it was principally remarkable for\r\nthe large number of books in all branches of old English literature, and\r\nit was especially rich in the works of the early poets and dramatists.\r\nIn 1776 Pearson again went to India, but after a residence there of five\r\nyears he fell a victim to the effects of the climate, and died at\r\nCalcutta on the 5th of August 1781. Some years after his death his\r\nlibrary was brought from Westmoreland, and sold on April 14th, 1788, and\r\ntwenty-two following days, by T. and J. Egerton at their room in\r\nScotland Yard. The prices obtained at the sale, in which there were\r\nfive thousand five hundred and twenty-five lots, were very\r\nsmall:--Boccaccio's _The Falle of Princis and Princesses and other\r\nNobles_, translated by Lydgate, and printed by Pynson in 1494, fetched\r\nbut one pound, twelve shillings; _The Castell of Laboure_, also printed\r\nby Pynson, two guineas; two books printed by Wynkyn de Worde--Hawes's\r\n_Example of Virtu_, and _The Lyf of Saynt Ursula_, translated by\r\nHatfield--seven pounds, ten shillings and one pound, ten shillings;\r\nSkelton's _Ryght Delectable Traytise upon a goodly Garlande, or Chapelet\r\nof Laurell_, printed by Richard Faukes in 1523--an excessively rare, if\r\nnot unique book--seven pounds, seventeen shillings and sixpence; Peele's\r\n_Polyhymnia_, London, 1590, three guineas; Lyly's _Midas_, London, 1592,\r\nseven pounds; and _England's Helicon_, collected by John Bodenham,\r\nLondon, 1600, five pounds, ten shillings. Two volumes of ballads,\r\nchiefly collected by the Earl of Oxford, and purchased by Major Pearson\r\nat Mr. West's sale, were bought by the Duke of Roxburghe for thirty-six\r\npounds, four shillings and sixpence, and are now, with additions by the\r\nDuke, preserved in the British Museum. Books bound for Pearson may be\r\nrecognised by the device of a bird surmounting a vase, stamped on the\r\npanels of the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUKE OF ROXBURGHE.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The marked catalogue says L94, 10s.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: _Bibliomania_, London, 1811, p. 617.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN KER, DUKE OF ROXBURGHE, 1740-1804\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Ker, third Duke of Roxburghe, was born on the 23rd of April 1740 in\r\nHanover Square, London. He was the elder son of Robert Ker, second Duke,\r\nand on the death of his father in 1755 succeeded to the title and\r\nestates. While on a tour on the Continent he became greatly attached to\r\nChristiana, eldest daughter of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, and\r\nthere is little doubt that she would have become his wife had not King\r\nGeorge III. soon afterwards sought the hand of the Princess's younger\r\nsister in marriage, when it was considered necessary to break off the\r\nmatch, partly for political reasons, and partly because 'it was deemed\r\nindecorous that the elder sister should be the subject of the younger.'\r\nThis was a great disappointment to both the Duke and the Princess, who\r\nevinced the strength of their affection by remaining single during their\r\nlives. George III., probably feeling that he had done the Duke an\r\ninjury, always manifested a warm friendship for him, and bestowed upon\r\nhim various appointments in the royal household. In 1768 he was made a\r\nKnight of the Thistle, and in 1801 was invested with the Order of the\r\nGarter. He died on the 19th of March 1804.\r\n\r\nThe Duke, who was remarkable both for his fine presence and his mental\r\naccomplishments, collected a magnificent library at his residence in St.\r\nJames's Square, London. It contained among numerous other treasures the\r\nfamous Valdarfer Boccaccio, upwards of a dozen volumes printed by\r\nCaxton, and many from the presses of Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde, Julian\r\nNotary, and other early English printers. The first, second, and third\r\nShakespeare folios were in the collection, as well as a large number of\r\nearly quarto plays. The library was especially rich in choice editions\r\nof the French romances, and in the works of the English dramatists who\r\nflourished during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. Some rare books\r\nprinted in Scotland were also to be found in it. The collection of\r\nbroadside ballads in three thick folio volumes, now in the British\r\nMuseum, is perhaps the most extensive and interesting ever brought\r\ntogether. It was begun by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, from whose\r\nlibrary it passed successively to those of Mr. James West and Major\r\nThomas Pearson, and at the sale of the books of the last-named collector\r\nit was purchased for thirty-six pounds, four shillings and sixpence by\r\nthe Duke, who made many additions to it while in his possession. The\r\ncollection has been admirably edited by Mr. William Chappell and the\r\nRev. J.W. Ebsworth for the Ballad Society. Other books deserving\r\nspecial notice were the first edition of Pliny, printed by J. de Spira\r\nat Venice in 1469; Cicero's _Epistolae ad Atticum_, etc., printed at Rome\r\nin 1470; the 1580 edition of the _Paradyse of Daintie Devises_, and the\r\nfirst edition of Shakespeare's _Sonnets_.\r\n\r\nAmong the manuscripts the most valuable were Chaucer's _Canterbury\r\nTales_, bound with Lydgate's _Life of St. Margarete_, on vellum, with\r\nilluminations, and the _Mystere de la Vengeance de Nostre Seigneur_,\r\nalso on vellum.\r\n\r\nThe library was sold in 1812 by Mr. Evans of Pall Mall in the\r\ndining-room of the Duke's house in St. James's Square, and the total\r\namount realised was twenty-three thousand three hundred and ninety-seven\r\npounds, ten shillings and sixpence. The sale, which consisted of nine\r\nthousand three hundred and fifty-three lots, lasted forty-two days,\r\ncommencing on the 18th of May, and ending on the 4th of July. It was\r\nfollowed by a supplementary one of seven hundred and sixty-seven lots,\r\nwhich began on the 13th of July, and lasted till the 16th of the same\r\nmonth. The catalogue was compiled by Mr. George Nicol, bookseller to the\r\nKing. The sale excited very great interest; and Dibdin, who gives an\r\naccount of it in his _Bibliographical Decameron_, tells us 'the room was\r\nso crowded that nothing but standing upon a contiguous bench saved the\r\nwriter of _The Bibliographical Decameron_ from suffocation.' The prices\r\nobtained for the books were very high. That 'most notorious volume in\r\nexistence,' the Valdarfer Boccaccio, which cost the Duke of Roxburghe\r\nbut one hundred guineas, was acquired by the Marquis of Blandford, after\r\na severe struggle with Lord Spencer, for two thousand two hundred and\r\nsixty pounds, and Dibdin says that the Marquis declared that it was his\r\nintention to have gone as far as five thousand guineas for it. A copy of\r\nthe _Recuyell of the Histories of Troye_, which once belonged to\r\nElizabeth Grey, wife of Edward IV., was purchased by the Duke of\r\nDevonshire for one thousand and sixty pounds, ten shillings; while three\r\nother books from the press of Caxton, _The Mirrour of the World_, the\r\n_Fayts of Arms_, and Gower's _Confessio Amantis_, sold respectively for\r\nthree hundred and fifty-one pounds, ten shillings, three hundred and\r\nthirty-six pounds, and three hundred and thirty-six pounds. The\r\ncollection of ballads fell to Mr. J. Harding for four hundred and\r\nseventy-seven pounds, fifteen shillings. At the sale of Mr. B.H.\r\nBright's books in 1845 it was secured for the British Museum for the sum\r\nof five hundred and thirty-five pounds. The first folio of Shakespeare's\r\nPlays fetched one hundred pounds, and his Sonnets twenty-one pounds. The\r\ntwo manuscripts mentioned realised three hundred and fifty-seven pounds\r\nand four hundred and ninety-three pounds, ten shillings.\r\n\r\nA dinner was given, at the suggestion of Dr. Dibdin, to commemorate the\r\nsale of the Boccaccio; and Earl Spencer, Dr. Dibdin, and other\r\nbibliophiles met on the day of the sale at St. Alban's Tavern, St.\r\nAlban's Street--now Waterloo Place--and then and there formed the\r\nRoxburghe Club; Earl Spencer being the first President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL WODHULL, 1740-1816\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Wodhull, the translator of the tragedies of Euripides, was born\r\nat Thenford, Northamptonshire, on the 15th of August 1740. His father\r\nwas John Wodhull, a descendant of Walter Flandrensis, who held the\r\nestates of Pateshull and Thenford in the time of William I. He received\r\nhis early education under the Rev. William Cleaver of Twyford, Bucks. He\r\nwas afterwards sent to Winchester, and at the age of seventeen proceeded\r\nto the University of Oxford, matriculating from Brazenose College. While\r\nstill young Wodhull inherited a considerable fortune from his father,\r\nand he built a fine mansion on the family estate at Thenford, in which\r\nhe kept his library. He was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1783.\r\nWodhull married a daughter of the Rev. J. Ingram of Wolford,\r\nWarwickshire, by whom he had three children, who all predeceased him.\r\nHe died on the 10th of November 1816. In addition to his translations of\r\nthe tragedies of Euripides, Wodhull was the author of several poems.\r\nFrom 1764 to his death Wodhull was an indefatigable collector of rare\r\nand curious books, and Dibdin says of him that 'a better informed or\r\nmore finished bibliographer existed not either in France or England.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK-STAMP OF MICHAEL WODHULL.]\r\n\r\nHis splendid library, which was a great consolation and pleasure to him\r\nin the solitude of the last years of his life, was particularly rich in\r\nearly editions of the Greek and Latin classics, and in works printed in\r\nthe fifteenth century. All the books--many of which were bound by Roger\r\nPayne--were in fine condition, and some of them had once formed part of\r\nthe libraries of Francis I., Grolier, Henry II. and Diana of Poitiers,\r\nLongepierre, and other famous French collectors, and were bound by such\r\nfine craftsmen as Boyet, Derome, Monnier, etc. The covers of the volumes\r\nbound for Wodhull are mostly impressed with a stamp of his arms, impaled\r\nwith those of his wife. A portion of Wodhull's books, principally\r\nduplicates, was sold by Leigh, Sotheby and Son, of York Street, Covent\r\nGarden, at two sales in 1801 and 1803. The first sale consisted of a\r\nthousand and fifty-nine lots, which realised three hundred and sixty-one\r\npounds, ten shillings; and the second of one thousand six hundred and\r\nthirty-nine lots, for which the sum of eight hundred and fifteen pounds\r\nwas obtained. The remainder of the library appears to have been kept at\r\nThenford until 1886, when Mr. J.E. Severne, M.P., to whom it had\r\ndescended, determined to part with it, and it was sold by Wilkinson,\r\nSotheby and Hodge on January 11th, 1886, and nine following days. There\r\nwere two thousand eight hundred and four lots in the sale, which\r\nproduced the large sum of eleven thousand nine hundred and seventy-two\r\npounds, fourteen shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the rarest and most interesting books in this\r\nsplendid collection, with the prices they fetched:--the _Catholicon_ of\r\nJoannes Balbus, printed at Mentz in 1460, three hundred and ten pounds;\r\n_Cicero de Officiis_, printed at Mentz in 1466, seventy-one pounds;\r\n_Tullius de Senectute et Amicitia_, printed by Caxton in 1481, two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds; (a perfect copy of Caxton's _Mirrour of the\r\nWorld_ was sold in the 1803 sale for thirty-eight pounds, seventeen\r\nshillings); the first edition of Homer, printed at Florence in 1488,\r\ntwo hundred pounds; _Poliphili Hypnerotomachia_, printed by Aldus in\r\n1499, fifty-three pounds; the Aldine Virgil of 1501, one hundred and\r\nforty-five pounds; _Roman de Guy de Warwick_, Paris, 1525, one hundred\r\nand thirty pounds; the _New Actes and Constitucionis of Parliament maid\r\nby James V., Kyng of Scottis_, printed on vellum at Edinburgh in 1541,\r\none hundred and fifty-one pounds; the _Contes_ of La Fontaine, Amsterdam\r\n(Paris), 1762, in two small 8vo volumes, bound in red morocco,\r\nninety-three pounds; Moliere's Works, with plates by Moreau, six\r\nvolumes, 1773, seventy-seven pounds.\r\n\r\nAmong the books with historical or fine bindings were Alcyonius,\r\n_Medices Legatus de Exsilio_, in aedib. Aldi, Venetiis, 1522, bound for\r\nFrancis I., with the arms of France, the crowned initial of the king,\r\nand the salamander stamped on the covers, fifty-eight pounds; Aristotle,\r\n_De Arte Poetica_, Florentiae, 1548, bound for Henry II. of France and\r\nDiana of Poitiers, with the devices of the king and his mistress on the\r\ncovers, two hundred and five pounds; Crinitus, _De Poetis Latinis_,\r\nFlorentiae, 1505, bound for Grolier, seventy-four pounds; _Irenici\r\nGermania_, Hagenoae, 1518, also bound for Grolier, sixty-two pounds; and\r\ntwo works by Giordano Bruno--_Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante_, Parigi,\r\n1584, and _La Cena de la Ceneri_, 1584; the former bound in citron\r\nmorocco, with a red double by Boyet, and the latter in a beautiful\r\nmosaic binding by Monnier, realised respectively the large sums of three\r\nhundred and sixty pounds and three hundred and sixty-five pounds.\r\n\r\nThe principal manuscripts were a copy of Dante, with a commentary by\r\nJoannes de Sarravalle, written in the years 1416-17, which sold for one\r\nhundred and fifty-one pounds; and a very beautiful Roman Breviary of the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, on vellum, illuminated for Francois\r\nde Castelnau, Archbishop of Narbonne, for which five hundred and fifteen\r\npounds was obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS HARGRAVE, 1741?-1821\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Hargrave, the eminent law writer, who was born about 1741, was\r\nthe son of Christopher Hargrave of Chancery Lane. He entered as a\r\nstudent at Lincoln's Inn in 1760, and in 1772 he greatly distinguished\r\nhimself in the Habeas Corpus case of James Sommersett, a negro. Soon\r\nafterwards he was appointed one of the king's counsel, and in 1797 he\r\nwas made Recorder of Liverpool. He was also for many years Treasurer of\r\nLincoln's Inn. In 1813, in consequence of the impaired state of\r\nHargrave's health, his wife petitioned Parliament to purchase the fine\r\nlaw library which he had amassed, consisting of a considerable number of\r\nprinted books and about five hundred manuscripts; and on the\r\nrecommendation of a Committee of the House of Commons the collection was\r\nacquired by the Government for the sum of eight thousand pounds, and\r\ndeposited in the British Museum. Edwards, in his _Lives of the Founders\r\nof the British Museum_, says that 'the peculiar importance of the\r\nHargrave Collection consisted in its manuscripts and its annotated\r\nprinted books. The former were about five hundred in number, and were\r\nworks of great juridical weight and authority, not merely the\r\ncuriosities of black-letter law. Their collector was the most eminent\r\nparliamentary lawyer of his day, but his devotion to the science of law\r\nhad, to some degree, impeded his enjoyment of its sweets. During some of\r\nthe best years of his life he had been more intent on increasing his\r\nlegal lore than on swelling his legal profits. And thus the same\r\nlegislative act which enriched the Museum Library, in both of its\r\ndepartments, helped to smooth the declining years of a man who had won\r\nuncommon distinction in his special pursuit.' A catalogue of the\r\nmanuscripts was compiled by Sir Henry Ellis, and published in 1818.\r\nHargrave, among other important legal works, published a new edition of\r\n_State Trials from the eleventh year of Richard II. to the sixteenth of\r\nGeorge III._, in eleven volumes folio, in 1776-81; _Juridical Arguments\r\nand Collections_, in two volumes, in 1797-99; and _Jurisconsult\r\nExercitations_, in three volumes, in 1811-13. He died on the 16th of\r\nAugust 1821, and was buried in Lincoln's Inn Chapel. Lord Lyndhurst, in\r\nspeaking of Hargrave's great legal knowledge, declared that 'no man ever\r\nlived who was more conversant with the law of his country.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISAAC REED, 1742-1807\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Reed, the editor of Shakespeare, was born in London on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1742. He was a conveyancer, and had chambers, first in Gray's\r\nInn and afterwards in Staple Inn, where he died on the 5th of January\r\n1807. He was buried at Amwell in Hertfordshire. Reed, who was a Fellow\r\nof the Society of Antiquaries, collected books for upwards of forty\r\nyears, and Dibdin says that 'he would appear to have adopted the\r\ncobbler's well-known example of applying one room to almost every\r\ndomestic purpose: for Reed made his library his parlour, kitchen, and\r\nhall.' His extensive collection of books, which was rich in works\r\nrelating to the English drama and poetry, was sold by King and Lochee,\r\n38 King Street, Covent Garden, on Monday, November 2nd, 1807, and\r\nthirty-eight following days. The sale consisted of eight thousand nine\r\nhundred and fifty-seven lots, including prints and a few miscellaneous\r\narticles, and realised four thousand three hundred and eighty-six\r\npounds, nineteen shillings and sixpence. A copy of the catalogue, with\r\nthe prices added in manuscript, is preserved in the Library of King\r\nGeorge III. in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH BANKS, BART., 1744-1820\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., to whom the British Museum, in\r\naddition to other bequests, is indebted for one of the finest libraries\r\nof books on natural history ever collected, was born in Argyle Street,\r\nLondon, on the 13th of February 1744. He was the only son of William\r\nBanks, of Revesby Abbey, Lincolnshire, by his wife Sarah, daughter of\r\nWilliam Bate. Banks was first educated at Harrow and Eton, and proceeded\r\nafterwards to Christ Church, Oxford, which college he entered as a\r\ngentleman-commoner in 1760. In 1761 his father died, leaving him a large\r\nestate. He left the University in 1763, after having taken an honorary\r\ndegree, and in 1766 he set out on a scientific voyage to Newfoundland\r\nwith his friend Lieutenant Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, and brought\r\nback a large collection of plants and insects. In 1768 he accompanied\r\nCaptain Cook's expedition round the world in _The Endeavour_, a vessel\r\nwhich he equipped at his own expense, taking with him his friend and\r\nlibrarian Dr. Solander, two draughtsmen, and several servants. This\r\nvoyage, which was attended by many dangers and privations, occupied\r\nnearly three years, and the specimens which the enterprising collectors\r\nbrought home with them excited very great and general interest. Banks\r\nwas anxious to join Captain Cook's second expedition, but owing to some\r\ndifficulties respecting the fittings of the ship in which he was to have\r\nsailed he relinquished his purpose, and in 1772 paid a visit in company\r\nwith Dr. Solander to Iceland, where he obtained a large number of\r\nbotanical specimens, and also purchased a collection of Icelandic\r\nmanuscripts and printed books, including the library of Halfdan\r\nEinarsson, the literary historian of the island, which he gave to the\r\nBritish Museum on his return to England. Ten years later he presented a\r\nsecond collection to that institution. In 1778 Banks succeeded Sir John\r\nPringle as President of the Royal Society, a post he held for upwards of\r\nforty-one years. He had been a Fellow since the year 1766. In 1779 he\r\nmarried Dorothea, daughter of William Weston-Hugesson of Provender, in\r\nthe parish of Norton, Kent, and in 1781 he was created a baronet. In\r\n1795 he received the Order of the Bath, and in 1797 he was sworn of the\r\nPrivy Council. The National Institute of France elected him a member in\r\n1802. He died at his house at Spring Grove, Isleworth, on the 19th of\r\nJune 1820, leaving a widow but no issue.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks, even when a schoolboy, took great interest in all\r\nbranches of natural history, and during his residence at Oxford he\r\nprocured the appointment of a lecturer on natural science in the\r\nUniversity. He was always exceedingly generous in his relations with men\r\nof science, and the splendid collections in his house in Soho Square\r\nwere always open to them for study and investigation.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks bequeathed his library, with the exception of some\r\nmanuscripts which he left to the Royal Society and the Mint, his\r\nherbarium, drawings, engravings, and other collections to the Trustees\r\nof the British Museum, subject to a life interest and a life use in them\r\nby his friend and librarian, Mr. Robert Brown, the eminent botanist.\r\nThis bequest was accompanied by a proviso that Mr. Brown should be at\r\nliberty to transfer the collections to the British Museum during his\r\nlifetime, if the Trustees were desirous to receive them, and he were\r\nwilling to comply with their wishes. An arrangement to this effect was\r\neventually carried out, and in the year 1827 the transfer was effected;\r\nMr. Brown at the same time receiving the appointment of Keeper of the\r\nDepartment of Botany in the Museum, a post he held until his death in\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nThe number of printed books acquired by the Museum amounted to about\r\nsixteen thousand, consisting principally of works on natural history and\r\nthe journals and transactions of learned societies. The manuscripts\r\nnumbered but forty-nine, but among them were the log-books of _The\r\nEndeavour_, _The Resolution_, and _The Racehorse_, and the journals of\r\nTasman, Carver, Verwey and other navigators.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of the library was compiled by Mr. Jonas Dryander, who\r\nsucceeded Dr. Solander as Sir Joseph's librarian, in five volumes, and\r\npublished in London in the years 1798-1800.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Banks was the author of two treatises:--one, _On the Cause of\r\nBlight in Corn_, published in 1805; and the other on _Some Circumstances\r\nrelative to Merino Sheep_, published in 1809; together with some\r\narticles contributed to the journals of learned societies. He evidently\r\nintended at one time to publish a work embodying the results of his\r\nresearches, as the plates were engraved, and the text partly prepared\r\nfor press, but the death of his librarian Dr. Solander in 1782 appears\r\nto have caused him to relinquish his purpose. Kaempfer's _Icones\r\nPlantarum_ was published by him in 1791, and he also superintended the\r\nissue of Roxburgh's _Coromandel Plants_ in 1795-1819. A statue of Sir\r\nJoseph by Sir Francis Chantrey is placed in the Natural History Museum\r\nin South Kensington, and a portrait of him by Sir Thomas Lawrence is\r\nhung in the board-room of the British Museum. Another portrait of him by\r\nThomas Phillips, R.A., is in the National Portrait Gallery.\r\n\r\nSarah Sophia Banks, the only sister of Sir Joseph Banks, possessed\r\nsimilar tastes to her brother, and amassed a considerable number of\r\nbooks, coins, objects of natural history, etc. She died at her brother's\r\nhouse in Soho Square on the 27th of September 1818; and after her death\r\na portion of her collections, consisting of sixty-six volumes of\r\nmanuscripts, chiefly relating to heraldic matters, ceremonials, archery,\r\netc., together with several printed books principally treating of\r\nchivalry, knighthood, etc., some of them enriched with her MS. notes,\r\nwere presented to the library of the British Museum by Lady Banks, the\r\nwife of Sir Joseph. Several of the volumes were in very fine bindings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. JOHN BRAND, 1744-1806\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Brand, the author of _Observations on Popular\r\nAntiquities_, was born on the 19th of August 1744 at Washington, in the\r\ncounty of Durham, where his father Alexander Brand was parish clerk.\r\nWhen fourteen years of age he was apprenticed to his uncle Anthony\r\nWheatley, a shoemaker of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and during his residence\r\nin that town he attended the grammar school there. He displayed so much\r\nability and industry that the master of the school, the Rev. Hugh\r\nMoises, with the assistance of some friends, sent him to Lincoln\r\nCollege, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1775. He had been ordained\r\nsome time previously, and, after filling several curacies, in 1784 he\r\nwas presented by the Duke of Northumberland to the rectory of the united\r\nparishes of St. Mary-at-Hill and St. Mary Hubbard in the city of London.\r\nIn the same year he was elected resident secretary of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, an office he held until his death on the 11th of September\r\n1806. He was buried in the chancel of his church. Brand had a very\r\nextensive knowledge of antiquities, and he accumulated a large library,\r\nwhich was very rich in old English literature.\r\n\r\nAmong the rarer books were the _Knight of the Tower_, printed by Caxton\r\nin 1484; the _Dyalogue of Dives and Pauper_, and Arnold's _Chronicle of\r\nthe Customs of London_, printed by Pynson in 1493 and 1521; _A Plaister\r\nfor a Galled Horse_, London, 1548; John Byshop's _Beautiful Blossomes_,\r\nLondon, 1577; Thomas Bentley's _Monument of Matrones_, London, 1582; _A\r\nBooke of Fishing with hooke and line_, London, 1600; Mrs. Fage's\r\n_Poems_, London, 1637; and _A Juniper Lecture_, London, 1639. The\r\ncollection also contained some curious works on witches.\r\n\r\nAfter Brand's death, the library was sold in two parts by Stewart of 194\r\nPiccadilly. The first sale took place on May 6th, 1807, and thirty-six\r\nfollowing days, 'Sundays, the King's Birthday, and May 21-26 excepted.'\r\nIt consisted of eight thousand six hundred and eleven lots of printed\r\nbooks, and two hundred and forty-three of manuscripts, which realised\r\nfour thousand three hundred pounds. The second part, containing\r\nduplicates and pamphlets, was sold on February the 8th, 1808, and\r\nfourteen following days, 'Sundays and the Fastday excepted.' There were\r\nfour thousand and sixty-four lots in this portion, and the sum obtained\r\nfor them was eighteen hundred and fifty-one pounds. _The Knight of the\r\nTower_ was purchased by Mr. Payne the bookseller for Earl Spencer for\r\none hundred and eleven pounds, six shillings; Arnold's _Chronicle_\r\nfetched eighteen guineas; the _Dyalogue of Dives and Pauper_, four\r\npounds, three shillings; Bentley's _Monument of Matrones_, eight pounds,\r\neighteen shillings and sixpence; and Mrs. Fage's _Poems_, five pounds,\r\nfifteen shillings and sixpence. A copy of Brand's own work on _Popular\r\nAntiquities_, with additions for a new edition, sold, with the\r\ncopyright, for six hundred and thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his _Observations on Popular Antiquities_, which appeared\r\nin 1777, Brand published a work on the _History and Antiquities of the\r\ntown and county of Newcastle-upon-Tyne_ in 1789; and in 1775 a poem _On\r\nIllicit Love, written among the ruins of Godstow Nunnery, near\r\nOxford_--the place where the celebrated Rosamond, the mistress of Henry\r\nII., was buried. He also contributed many papers to the _Archaeologia_ of\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nNichols, in his _Literary Anecdotes_,[90] says of Brand that 'his\r\nmanners, somewhat repulsive to a stranger, became easy on closer\r\nacquaintance, and he loved to communicate to men of literary and\r\nantiquarian taste the result of his researches on any subject in which\r\nthey might require information.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN DENT, 1750?-1826\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John Dent was born about the middle of the eighteenth century. His\r\nfather is said to have been the master of a school in a small town in\r\nCumberland. At an early age he entered the banking-house of Messrs.\r\nChild and Co. of London as a clerk, and in 1795 rose to be a partner in\r\nthe firm. In 1790 he was elected Member of Parliament for the borough\r\nof Leicester, and held the seat during five successive Parliaments\r\nuntil the dissolution in 1812. Six years later he was chosen Member for\r\nPoole, which he represented till 1826. He died at his residence in\r\nHertford Street, Mayfair, on the 14th of December 1826.\r\n\r\nMr. Dent, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, accumulated a very fine library, which was very rich in the\r\nGreek and Latin Classics and early English literature. It also contained\r\nsome very beautiful manuscripts. After his death it was sold in two\r\nparts by Mr. Evans of Pall Mall. The first sale, which took place on\r\nMarch the 29th, 1827, and eight following days, consisted of fifteen\r\nhundred and two lots, and realised six thousand two hundred and\r\nseventy-eight pounds, twelve shillings. The second portion of the books\r\nwas sold on the 25th of the succeeding month and eight following days.\r\nThere were one thousand four hundred and seventy-four lots in this sale,\r\nwhich brought eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-two pounds, seven\r\nshillings. The following are a few of the many very rare books which\r\nthis noble collection contained, and the prices which were obtained for\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\nFust and Schoeffer's Latin Bible of 1462, one hundred and seventy-three\r\npounds, five shillings; a vellum copy of the first edition of Livy,\r\nprinted by Sweynheym and Pannartz at Rome in 1469, two hundred and\r\nsixty-two pounds, ten shillings; the first edition of the _Anthologia\r\nGraeca_ on vellum, printed at Florence in 1494, seventy pounds; a perfect\r\ncopy of Higden's _Polychronicon_, printed by Caxton in 1482, one hundred\r\nand three pounds, nineteen shillings; three other imperfect Caxtons,\r\nfifty-eight pounds, seventeen shillings and sixpence; Barclay's _Shyp of\r\nFolys_, printed by Pynson in 1509, thirty pounds, nine shillings;\r\nBradshawe's _Lyfe of Saynt Radegunde_, printed by Pynson, without date,\r\nthirty-two pounds; _The Cronycle of Englonde_, printed by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde in 1502, thirty-eight pounds, seventeen shillings; a copy on\r\nvellum of the _Orcharde of Syon_, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1519,\r\nsixty-five pounds, two shillings; _Vitruvius de Architectura_, printed\r\non vellum by P. de Giunta in 1513, one hundred and seven pounds, two\r\nshillings; the Coverdale Bible, 1535, eighty-nine pounds, five\r\nshillings; and Archbishop Parker's _De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae_,\r\n1573, forty pounds. Mr. Dent possessed the first three Shakespeare\r\nfolios, and a large number of the separate quarto plays. The folios\r\nrealised respectively one hundred and ten pounds, five shillings,\r\nfifteen pounds, and sixty-five pounds, two shillings. The copy of the\r\nthird folio had many contemporary manuscript corrections. Of the quarto\r\nplays, twenty-six pounds was obtained for the first edition of _Love's\r\nLabors Lost_, twenty-two pounds for the first edition of _Othello_,\r\nsixteen pounds for the first edition of _The Merchant of Venice_, and\r\nfour pounds, ten shillings for the first edition of _Midsummer Night's\r\nDream_.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the manuscripts were of exceptional beauty and interest. A\r\nRoman Breviary, with illuminations in the finest Flemish style,\r\npresented to Queen Isabel of Castile by Francisco de Rojas, sold for\r\nthree hundred and seventy-eight pounds; a copy of the Gospels in Greek,\r\nsaid to have been written about the end of the eleventh century, for two\r\nhundred and sixty-seven pounds, fifteen shillings; an _Office de la\r\nVierge_, written by Nicolas Jarry, the celebrated calligraphist, in 1656\r\nfor Anne of Austria, and which afterwards passed into the possession of\r\nMadame de Maintenon and the Prince de Conti, for one hundred and ten\r\npounds, five shillings; and a copy of the _Westminster Liber Regalis_,\r\nwritten in the fifteenth century, for fifty-five pounds, thirteen\r\nshillings. All these manuscripts were on vellum. The copies of the Roman\r\nBreviary and the Greek Gospels are described by Dibdin in his\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_ (vol. i. pp. clxiii and xcii).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Vol. ix. p. 653.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT HON. THOMAS GRENVILLE, 1755-1846\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS GRENVILLE. After a Portrait by Hoppner.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, who was born on the 31st of December\r\n1755, was the second son of the Right Hon. George Grenville, the\r\nstatesman, who succeeded Lord Bute as Premier in 1763, and Elizabeth,\r\ndaughter of Sir William Wyndham. In 1771 he entered Christ Church,\r\nOxford, as a gentleman-commoner, and in 1778 he was appointed ensign in\r\nthe Coldstream Guards, which he left the following year to become a\r\nlieutenant in the 80th foot. In 1780 he was elected Member for\r\nBuckinghamshire, and became a follower of Lord Rockingham and Mr. Fox,\r\nthe latter of whom thought so highly of his talents that he intended, if\r\nhis India Bill had passed, to have made him Governor-General. Towards\r\nthe close of the war with the United States, Mr. Grenville was sent to\r\nParis to negotiate terms of peace, but only remained there a short time,\r\nbeing recalled by the death of the Marquis of Rockingham and a change of\r\nministry. On his return to this country he continued for some time to\r\nsupport Mr. Fox, but the course pursued by that statesman with regard to\r\nthe French Revolution caused him to transfer his allegiance to Mr. Pitt,\r\nand in 1794 Mr. Grenville accepted the post of Minister Extraordinary\r\nto the Court of Vienna. In 1798 he became a privy councillor, and in\r\n1799 he was sent as Ambassador to Berlin to endeavour to prevent the\r\nKing of Prussia deserting the coalition against France; but the first\r\nvessel in which he sailed was stopped by ice, and the second was\r\nwrecked, and the delay which ensued rendered the mission an abortive\r\none. In 1800 he was made Chief Justice in Eyre to the South of the\r\nTrent, a sinecure office of two thousand a year, of which he was the\r\nlast holder. On the fall of Mr. Pitt's ministry in March 1801, Mr.\r\nGrenville ceased to support the Tory party, and renewed his political\r\nconnection with Mr. Fox, and in 1806, shortly after his brother, Lord\r\nGrenville, became Prime Minister, he was appointed President of the\r\nBoard of Control. On the death of Mr. Fox on the 13th of September 1806,\r\nhe succeeded Lord Howick as First Lord of the Admiralty, a post he held\r\nuntil the formation of the Duke of Portland's administration in April\r\n1807, when he finally retired from office, and devoted the remaining\r\nforty years of his life to literature, and to the collection of the\r\nsplendid library, which is now one of the great glories of the British\r\nMuseum. From an early age Mr. Grenville was animated by an ardent love\r\nfor books, and took a great interest in the development of the National\r\nLibrary, of which he was for many years a Trustee. He died at Hamilton\r\nPlace, Piccadilly, on the 17th of December 1846, at the age of\r\nninety-one. Mr. Grenville had originally bequeathed his library to his\r\ngreat-nephew the Duke of Buckingham, but the circumstance that it was\r\nprincipally purchased from the profits of the sinecure office which he\r\nhad held for so many years, led him to the conclusion that it was 'a\r\ndebt and a duty' that the collection so acquired should be devoted to\r\nthe use of the public. In the autumn of 1845, in the course of a\r\nconversation with his friend Mr. Panizzi, afterwards Sir Anthony\r\nPanizzi, then Keeper of Printed Books in the British Museum, he informed\r\nhim of his intention; and after his death it was found that he had\r\nrevoked the bequest to the Duke of Buckingham, and left his noble\r\ncollection to the nation. A full and interesting description of the\r\nprinted books in the library by Sir Anthony Panizzi is to be found in\r\nthe Report on the accessions to the Museum for the year 1847, and we\r\ncannot do better than give the account of them in the words of the\r\nfamous librarian, who had himself much to do with the acquisition of\r\nthis magnificent gift:--\r\n\r\n'With exception of the Collection of His Majesty George the Third, the\r\nLibrary of the British Museum has never received an accession so\r\nimportant in every respect as the Collection of the Right Honourable\r\nThomas Grenville.... Formed and preserved with the exquisite taste of an\r\naccomplished bibliographer, with the learning of a profound and elegant\r\nscholar, and the splendid liberality of a gentleman in affluent\r\ncircumstances, who employed in adding to his library whatever his\r\ngenerous heart allowed him to spare from silently relieving those whose\r\nwants he alone knew, this addition to the National Library places it in\r\nsome respects above all libraries known, in others it leaves it inferior\r\nonly to the Royal Library at Paris. An idea may be formed of the\r\nliterary value of Mr. Grenville's Library by referring to its pecuniary\r\nvalue; it consists of 20,240 volumes, forming about 16,000 works, which\r\ncost upwards of L54,000, and would sell for more now. During his\r\nlifetime, Mr. Grenville's library was most liberally rendered accessible\r\nto any person, however humble his condition in life, who could show the\r\nleast cause for asking the loan of any of his precious volumes. By\r\nbequeathing the whole to his country, Mr. Grenville has secured to\r\nliterary men, even after his death, that assistance, as far as it\r\nrelates to the use of his books, which he so generously bestowed on them\r\nin every way during his long and dignified career:--the career of a man\r\nof high birth, distinguished for uniting to a powerful and cultivated\r\nintellect a warm and benevolent heart.'\r\n\r\nSir Anthony Panizzi, in describing the contents of the collection, adds:\r\n'It would naturally be expected that one of the editors of the \"Adelphi\r\nHomer\" would lose no opportunity of collecting the best and rarest\r\neditions of the Prince of Poets. AEsop, a favourite author of Mr.\r\nGrenville, occurs in his Library in its rarest forms; there is no doubt\r\nthat the series of editions of this author in that library is\r\nunrivalled. The great admiration which Mr. Grenville felt for Cardinal\r\nXimenes, even more on account of the splendid edition of the Polyglot\r\nBible which that prelate caused to be printed at Alcala, than of his\r\npublic character, made him look upon the acquisition of the Moschus, a\r\nbook of extreme rarity, as a piece of good fortune. Among the extremely\r\nrare editions of the Latin Classics, in which the Grenville Library\r\nabounds, the unique complete copy of Azzoguidi's first edition of Ovid\r\nis a gem well deserving particular notice, and was considered, on the\r\nwhole, by Mr. Grenville himself, the boast of his collection. The Aldine\r\nVirgil of 1505, the rarest of the Aldine editions of this poet, is the\r\nmore welcome to the Museum, as it serves to supply a lacuna; the copy\r\nmentioned in the Catalogue of the Royal Collection not having been\r\ntransferred to the National Library.\r\n\r\n'The rarest editions of English Poets claimed and obtained the special\r\nattention of Mr. Grenville. Hence we find him possessing not only the\r\nfirst and second edition of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales by Caxton, but\r\nthe only copy known of a hitherto undiscovered edition of the same work\r\nprinted in 1498 by Wynkyn de Worde. Of Shakespeare's collected Dramatic\r\nWorks, the Grenville Library contains a copy of the first edition,\r\nwhich, if not the finest known, is at all events surpassed by none. His\r\nstrong religious feelings, and his sincere attachment to the\r\nEstablished Church, as well as his mastery and knowledge of the English\r\nLanguage, concurred in making him eager to possess the earliest, as well\r\nas the rarest, editions of the translations of the Scriptures in the\r\nvernacular tongue. He succeeded to a great extent; but what deserves\r\nparticular mention is the only known fragment of the New Testament in\r\nEnglish, translated by Tyndale and Roy, which was in the press of\r\nQuentell, at Cologne, in 1525, when the printers were obliged to\r\ninterrupt the printing, and fly to escape persecution.\r\n\r\n'The History of the British Empire, and whatever could illustrate any of\r\nits different portions, were the subject of Mr. Grenville's unremitting\r\nresearch, and he allowed nothing to escape him deserving to be\r\npreserved, however rare and expensive. Hence his collection of works on\r\nthe Divorce of Henry VIII.; that of Voyages and Travels, either by\r\nEnglishmen, or to countries at some time more or less connected with\r\nEngland, or possessed by her; that of contemporary works on the\r\ngathering, advance, and defeat of the \"Invincible Armada\"; and that of\r\nwritings on Ireland,--are more numerous, more valuable, and more\r\ninteresting than in any other collection ever made by any person on the\r\nsame subjects. Among the Voyages and Travels, the collections of De Bry\r\nand Hulsius are the finest in the world; no other library can boast of\r\nfour such fine books as the copies of Hariot's Virginia, in Latin,\r\nGerman, French, and English of the De Bry series. And it was fitting\r\nthat in Mr. Grenville's library should be found one of the only two\r\ncopies known of the first edition of this work, printed in London in\r\n1588, wherein an account is given of a colony which had been founded by\r\nhis family namesake, Sir Richard Grenville.\r\n\r\n'Conversant with the language and literature of Spain, as well as with\r\nthat of Italy, the works of imagination by writers of those two\r\ncountries are better represented in his library than in any other out of\r\nSpain and Italy; in some branches better even than in any single library\r\nin the countries themselves. No Italian collection can boast of such a\r\nsplendid series of early editions of Ariosto's Orlando, one of Mr.\r\nGrenville's favourite authors, nor, indeed, of such choice Romance\r\nPoems. The copy of the first edition of Ariosto is not to be matched for\r\nbeauty; of that of Rome, 1533, even the existence was hitherto unknown.\r\nA perfect copy of the first complete edition of the _Morgante Maggiore_\r\nof 1482, was also not known to exist before Mr. Grenville succeeded in\r\nprocuring his. Among the Spanish Romances, the copy of that of \"Tirant\r\nlo Blanch,\" printed at Valencia in 1490, is as fine, as clean, and as\r\nwhite as when it first issued from the press; and no second copy of\r\nthis edition of a work professedly translated from English into\r\nPortuguese, and thence into Valencian, is known to exist except in the\r\nlibrary of the Sapienza at Rome.\r\n\r\n'But where there is nothing common, it is almost depreciating a\r\ncollection to enumerate a few articles as rare. It is a marked feature\r\nof this library, that Mr. Grenville did not collect mere bibliographical\r\nrarities. He never aimed at having a complete set of the editions from\r\nthe press of Caxton or Aldus; but Chaucer and Gower by Caxton were\r\nreadily purchased, as well as other works which were desirable on other\r\naccounts, besides that of having issued from the press of that printer;\r\nand, when possible, select copies were procured. Some of the rarest, and\r\nthese the finest, Aldine editions were purchased by him for the same\r\nreasons. The Horae in Greek, printed by Aldus in 16mo in 1497, is a\r\nvolume which, from its language, size, and rarity, is of the greatest\r\nimportance for the literary and religious history of the time when it\r\nwas printed. It is, therefore, in Mr. Grenville's library. The Virgil of\r\n1501 is not only an elegant book, but it is the first book printed with\r\nthat peculiar _Italic_, known as Aldine, and the first volume which\r\nAldus printed, \"forma enchiridii,\" as he called it, being expressly\r\nadapted to give poor scholars the means of purchasing for a small sum\r\nthe works of the classical writers. This also is, therefore, among Mr.\r\nGrenville's books; and of one of the two editions of Virgil, both dated\r\nthe same year, 1514, he purchased a large paper copy, because it was the\r\nmore correct of the two.\r\n\r\n'It was the merit of the work, the elegance of the volume, the \"genuine\"\r\ncondition of the copy, etc., which together determined Mr. Grenville to\r\npurchase books printed on vellum, of which he collected nearly a\r\nhundred. He paid a very large sum for a copy of the Furioso of 1532, not\r\nbecause it was \"on ugly vellum,\" as he very properly designated it, but\r\nbecause, knowing the importance of such an edition of such a work, and\r\nnever having succeeded in procuring it on paper, he would rather have it\r\non expensive terms and \"ugly vellum,\" than not at all.\r\n\r\n'By the bequest of Mr. Grenville's library, the collection of books\r\nprinted on vellum now at the Museum, and comprising those formerly\r\npresented by George II., George III., and Mr. Cracherode, is believed to\r\nsurpass that of any other National Library, except the King's Library at\r\nParis, of which Van Praet justly speaks with pride, and all foreign\r\ncompetent and intelligent judges with envy and admiration. Injustice to\r\nthe Grenville Library, the list of all its vellum books ought here to be\r\ninserted. As this cannot be done, some only of the most remarkable shall\r\nbe mentioned. These are--the Greek Anthology of 1494; the Book of\r\nHawking, of Juliana Berners, of 1496; the first edition of the Bible,\r\nknown as the \"Mazarine Bible,\" printed at Mentz about 1454; the Aldine\r\nDante of 1502; the first Rationale of Durandus of 1459; the first\r\nedition of Fisher On the Psalms, of 1508; the Aldine Horace, Juvenal,\r\nMartial, and Petrarca, of 1501; the Livy of 1469; the Primer of\r\nSalisbury, printed in Paris in 1531; the Psalter of 1457, which supplies\r\nthe place of the one now at Windsor, which belonged to the Royal\r\nCollection before it was transferred to the British Museum; the\r\nSforziada, by Simoneta, of 1490, a most splendid volume even in so\r\nsplendid a library; the Theuerdank of 1517; the Aulus Gellius and the\r\nVitruvius of Giunta, printed in 1513, etc., etc. Of this identical copy\r\nof Vitruvius, formerly Mr. Dent's, the author of the Bibliographical\r\nDecameron wrote, \"Let the enthusiastic admirers of a genuine vellum\r\nJunta--of the amplest size and in spotless condition--resort to the\r\nchoice cabinet of Mr. Dent for such a copy of this edition of Vitruvius\r\nand Frontinus.\" The Aulus Gellius is in its original state, exactly as\r\nit was when presented to Lorenzo de' Medici, afterwards Duke of Urbino,\r\nto whom the edition was dedicated.'\r\n\r\nIn addition to the printed books, the Grenville Library contains\r\nsixty-four manuscripts, many of them being of great interest and value.\r\nThe finest of them is a volume of exquisite miniature drawings by\r\nGiulio Clovio, executed by command of Philip II. of Spain, and\r\nrepresenting the victories of the Emperor Charles V. This volume was\r\nformerly in the Escurial. Other notable manuscripts are the original\r\ndrawings for Hariot's Virginia in the De Bry collection, made by John\r\nWhite; Norden's Description of Essex; the Third Voyage of Vespucius in\r\nLatin; and two very interesting documents relating to the Spanish\r\nArmada--one being an original letter from the Lords of the Council to\r\nthe Lord High Admiral, regarding the preparation of the fleet, dated\r\nJuly 21, 1588; and the other, a Resolution of a Council of War, held by\r\nthe admirals and captains of the fleet which dispersed the Armada, dated\r\nAugust 1, 1588. The former of these papers is signed by Chr. Hatton\r\n(Cancs.), W. Burghley, F. Knollys, T. Heneage, Poulet, and J. Wolley;\r\nthe latter by C. Howard, George Cumberland, T. Howarde, Edmonde\r\nSheffeylde, Fr. Drake, Edw. Hoby, John Hawkyns, and Thomas Fenner.\r\n\r\nThere is a catalogue of Mr. Grenville's library in three parts (London,\r\n1842-72). Parts 1 and 2 were compiled by Messrs. Payne and Foss, the\r\nbooksellers of Pall Mall, who bought largely for him; and part 3 by Mr.\r\nW.B. Rye, the late Keeper of the Department of Printed Books, British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Mr. Grenville by Hoppner has been engraved for Fisher's\r\n_National Portrait Gallery_. There is also a painting of him by Phillips\r\nat Althorp, and a miniature by C. Manzini in the National Portrait\r\nGallery.\r\n\r\nA bust of him, presented by Sir David Dundas, is placed in the room in\r\nthe British Museum occupied by his library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCIS DOUCE, 1757-1834\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Douce, who was born in 1757, was a son of Thomas Douce, one of\r\nthe Six Clerks of the Court of Chancery. He was first sent to a school\r\nat Richmond, conducted by a Mr. Lawton, author of a work on Egypt, and\r\nafterwards to 'a French academy, kept by a pompous and ignorant\r\nLife-Guardsman, with a view to his learning merchants' accounts, which\r\nwere his aversion.' On leaving school he studied for the bar, and for\r\nsome time held an appointment, under his father, in the Six Clerks'\r\nOffice, but the post was not very congenial to him, as from an early age\r\nhe devoted himself to books and antiquities, and he also had a great\r\npassion for music. His father, who died in 1799, bequeathed the greater\r\npart of his property, which was very considerable, to his elder son,\r\nleaving but a comparatively small amount to be divided between Francis\r\nand his sisters, but in 1823 Nollekens, the sculptor, left Douce so\r\nlarge a portion of his fortune that at the decease of the latter his\r\nproperty was valued at nearly eighty thousand pounds. In 1807 he\r\nsucceeded the Rev. Robert Nares as Keeper of the Manuscripts in the\r\nBritish Museum, but resigned the post in 1812 in consequence of some\r\ntrifling disagreement with one of the trustees. While holding this\r\noffice he took part in the preparation of the catalogues of the Harleian\r\nand Lansdowne manuscripts. Douce published in 1807 _Illustrations of\r\nShakspeare and Ancient Manners_, and in 1833 _The Dance of Death_,\r\n'exhibited in elegant Engravings on wood, with a Dissertation on the\r\nseveral Representations on that Subject.' The substance of this\r\nDissertation had appeared about forty years before in illustration of\r\nHollar's etchings, published by Edwards of Pall Mall, London. In\r\naddition to these works he edited Arnold's _Chronicle_ in 1811, two\r\nbooks for the Roxburghe Club in 1822 and 1824, and assisted in the\r\nproduction of Scott's _Sir Tristram_, Smith's _Vagabondiniana_, and the\r\n1824 edition of Warton's _History of English Poetry_. Many papers also\r\nby him are to be found in the _Archaeologia_, the _Vetusta Monumenta_,\r\nand the _Gentleman's Magazine_. Douce was a prominent Fellow of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries, and numbered among his friends Isaac D'Israeli,\r\nthe Rev. C.M. Cracherode, Sir George Staunton, Mr. John Towneley, and\r\nDr. Dibdin, to the last of whom he left five hundred pounds. He is\r\nintroduced under the name of _Prospero_ in Dibdin's _Bibliomania_. Douce\r\ndied at his residence in Gower Street, London, on the 30th of March\r\n1834, and he left in his will two hundred pounds to Sir Anthony Carlisle\r\n'requesting him either to sever my head or extract the heart from my\r\nbody, so as to prevent the possibility of the return of vitality.' His\r\nvaluable collection of printed books, which consisted of sixteen\r\nthousand four hundred and eighty volumes, with a quantity of fragments\r\nof early English works, including two printed by Caxton, which are\r\nunique; three hundred and ninety-three manuscripts, many of them\r\nbeautifully illuminated; ninety-eight charters; a large number of\r\nvaluable drawings and prints; together with a collection of coins and\r\nmedals, were left by him to the Bodleian Library. It is said that this\r\nbequest was the result of the courteous reception he received from Dr.\r\nBandinel, the librarian, when Douce visited Oxford with Isaac D'Israeli\r\nin 1830. The carvings in ivory or other materials, and the miscellaneous\r\ncuriosities, were bequeathed to Dr., afterwards Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick,\r\nof Goodrich Castle, Wales, who published an account of them, entitled\r\n_The Doucean Museum_. To the British Museum Douce left a volume of the\r\nworks of Albert Duerer which had formerly belonged to Nollekens, his\r\nimpressions from monumental brasses, and his 'commented copies of the\r\nblockhead Whitaker's History of Manchester, and his Cornwall Cathedral.'\r\nHis will also directs his executor 'to collect together all my letters\r\nand correspondence, all my private manuscripts, and unfinished or even\r\nfinished essays or intended work or works, memorandum books, especially\r\nsuch as are marked in the inside of their covers with a red cross, with\r\nthe exception only of such articles as he may think proper to destroy,\r\nas my diaries, or other articles of a merely private nature, and to put\r\nthem into a strong box, to be sealed up without lock or key, and with a\r\nbrass plate inscribed \"Mr. Douce's papers, to be opened on the 1st of\r\nJanuary 1900,\" and then to deposit this box in the British Museum, or,\r\nif the Trustees should decline receiving it, I then wish it to remain\r\nwith the other things bequeathed to the Bodleian Library.' The Trustees\r\naccepted the charge of the box, and it was opened at the time appointed,\r\nbut nothing of literary value was found in it.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of the printed books, manuscripts, charters and fragments\r\npresented by Douce to the Bodleian was published in 1840, and there is\r\nalso a manuscript catalogue of the prints and drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES EDWARDS, 1757-1816\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Edwards, who was so ardent a collector that he directed that his\r\ncoffin should be made out of the shelves of his library, was born in\r\n1757. He was the eldest son of William Edwards, an eminent bookseller of\r\nHalifax, Yorkshire, who was noted both for his success in collecting\r\nrare books, and his skill and taste in binding them. In 1784 James\r\nEdwards and, along with him, his younger brother John, were set up by\r\ntheir father as booksellers in Pall Mall, London, under the title of\r\nEdwards and Sons. John died soon afterwards, but the business was\r\nconducted with great ability and success by the elder brother, who,\r\nDibdin says, 'travelled diligently and fearlessly abroad; now exploring\r\nthe book-gloom of dusty monasteries, and at other times marching in the\r\nrear or front of Bonaparte's armies in Italy.'\r\n\r\nEdwards was a bookbinder as well as a bookseller, and in 1785 he took\r\nout a patent for 'embellishing books bound in vellum by making drawings\r\non the vellum which are not liable to be defaced but by destroying the\r\nvellum itself.' This was accomplished by rendering the vellum\r\ntransparent, and then painting or impressing the design on the under\r\nsurface. The British Museum possesses a Prayer Book bound by Edwards in\r\nthis manner for Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III., which is a\r\nvery skilful and artistic piece of work. Both he and his father were\r\nalso celebrated for the pretty paintings with which they decorated the\r\nedges of the leaves of the books they bound. In 1788 Edwards,\r\naccompanied by his friend and fellow bookseller James Robson, went to\r\nVenice for the purpose of purchasing the Pinelli Library, which they\r\nbrought to England, and sold by auction in the following year. Many\r\nother collections of note were sold by him during the twenty years he\r\nremained in business. Having amassed a considerable fortune, he\r\ndetermined to retire from trade, and in 1805 purchased the fine old\r\nmanor-house at Harrow, which for some time was one of the residences of\r\nthe Archbishops of Canterbury. A part of Dibdin's _Bibliographical\r\nDecameron_ was written on the garden terrace of this mansion, Edwards\r\nbeing the 'Rinaldo' of that work. In consequence of ill-health he\r\ndetermined in 1815 to part with the remainder of his library (a portion\r\nof the books had been disposed of by Christie on his retirement in\r\n1804), and it was sold by his successor in the Pall Mall business,\r\nRobert Harding Evans, who became so well known as a book auctioneer. The\r\nsale consisted of but eight hundred and thirty lots, but it realised the\r\nlarge sum of eight thousand four hundred and twenty-one pounds,\r\nseventeen shillings. Edwards died at Harrow on the 2nd of January 1816,\r\nand a monument was erected to his memory in the parish church.\r\n\r\nEdwards's collection was not a large one, but it contained some\r\nexceedingly rare and choice manuscripts and printed books. Among the\r\nmost precious of the former was the famous Bedford Book of Hours, which\r\nhe acquired at the Duchess of Portland's sale in 1786 for two hundred\r\nand thirteen pounds, and which was purchased at his own sale by the\r\nMarquis of Blandford, afterwards Duke of Marlborough, for six hundred\r\nand eighty-seven pounds, fifteen shillings. It is now in the British\r\nMuseum. Other fine manuscripts were a copy of the Gospels in Greek,\r\nwritten in the tenth century; _Opera Horatii_, executed for Ferdinand I.\r\nKing of Naples, which realised respectively two hundred and ten and one\r\nhundred and twenty-five pounds; and _Regole e Precetti della Pittura_,\r\nwritten by Leonardo da Vinci, and illustrated with original drawings by\r\nNicholas Poussin, which fetched one hundred and two pounds, eighteen\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nAmong the printed books were the Latin Bible, on vellum, printed at\r\nMentz, by Fust and Schoeffer, in 1462, which realised one hundred and\r\nseventy-five pounds; and the first edition of Livy, also on vellum,\r\nprinted by Sweynheym and Pannartz at Rome about 1469. This copy, the\r\nonly one known on vellum, belonged to Pope Alexander VI., and was bought\r\nby Sir M.M. Sykes for nine hundred and three pounds. It was afterwards\r\nacquired by the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, and bequeathed by him to\r\nthe British Museum. Luther's own copy of the first edition of his\r\ntranslation of the Bible after his final revision, printed at Wittemberg\r\nin 1541, with MS. notes by himself, Bugenhagen and Melanchthon, which is\r\nalso now in the British Museum, sold for eighty-nine pounds, five\r\nshillings; and a splendid set of the _Opere di Piranesi_ for three\r\nhundred and fifteen pounds. A fine and perfect block-book, the _Biblia\r\nPauperum_, was also among the treasures of the library, and was\r\npurchased by the Duke of Devonshire for two hundred and ten pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE HIBBERT, 1757-1837\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Hibbert was born at Manchester in the year 1757. His father was\r\nRobert Hibbert, a West India merchant. Destined from his boyhood to a\r\ncommercial life, he was educated at a private school, and on leaving\r\nLancashire he joined a London firm engaged in the West India trade, in\r\nwhich, first as a junior partner, and afterwards as the head of the\r\nfirm, he remained nearly half a century. In 1798 Mr. Hibbert was elected\r\nan alderman, but resigned his gown in 1803, and in 1806 he entered\r\nParliament as one of the members for Seaford, Sussex, and sat for that\r\nborough until 1812. He was also chairman of the West India merchants,\r\nand agent for Jamaica. The construction of the West India Docks was\r\nlargely owing to his exertions, and as one of the original members of\r\nthe committee of the London Institution, he took a prominent part in its\r\nfoundation and management, and for many years he filled the office of\r\npresident. Mr. Hibbert was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in\r\n1811, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in the following year.\r\nHe was also a Fellow of the Linnaean Society, and formed at his residence\r\nat Clapham a large collection of exotic plants, many of which were first\r\nintroduced into this country by the agents he employed in almost every\r\npart of the globe. He married Elizabeth Margaret, daughter of Mr. Philip\r\nFonnereau, by whom he had a large family. Mr. Hibbert died on the 8th of\r\nOctober 1837, at Munden House, near Watford, Hertfordshire, and was\r\nburied in the churchyard of Aldenham, in the same county.\r\n\r\nMr. Hibbert, who was the 'Honorio' of Dibdin's _Bibliographical\r\nDecameron_, was a patron of art, and an enthusiastic collector of books,\r\npictures, and prints and drawings. He formed a splendid library at his\r\nhouses at Clapham, and in Portland Place, London, which is believed to\r\nhave cost him at least thirty-five thousand pounds. It contained a\r\nlarge number of early printed Bibles, and was particularly rich in rare\r\neditions of the French Romances, and of English and Italian Poetry. No\r\nfewer than eighty of the books were printed on vellum. The collection\r\nalso comprised twenty-five manuscripts.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1829, Mr. Hibbert retired to his estate of Munden, which had\r\nbeen bequeathed to him by Mr. Roger Parker, an uncle of his wife, he\r\nfound that the size of his new residence rendered it necessary that he\r\nshould dispose of the greater part of his collections, and his library\r\nwas sold by auction by Mr. Evans at 93 Pall Mall in three divisions. The\r\nsales occupied altogether forty-two days. The first commenced on the\r\n16th of March, and the last on the 25th of May 1829. There were eight\r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety-four lots, representing about twenty\r\nthousand volumes; and the total amount realised was twenty-one thousand\r\nseven hundred and fifty-three pounds, nine shillings. The books sold for\r\ncomparatively small sums. A copy of the sale catalogue, with the prices\r\nobtained for the books and the names of the purchasers, is preserved in\r\nthe library of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the principal books in this magnificent\r\ncollection, together with the prices they fetched at the sale:--\r\n\r\nThe Gutenberg Bible, two hundred and fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Mentz Psalter of 1459, ninety pounds, six shillings.\r\n\r\nThe Latin Bible printed by Fust and Schoeffer at Mentz in 1462, one\r\nhundred and twenty-eight pounds, two shillings.\r\n\r\nThe Latin Bible, printed at Paris in 1476, thirty-two pounds, eleven\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\nThe Latin Bible, printed by Jenson at Venice in 1479.

Thirty-six pounds, four shillings\r\nand sixpence was obtained for the _Catholicon_, and three hundred and\r\nthirty-nine pounds, thirteen shillings and sixpence for the Caxtons. Of\r\nthese the _Recuyell_ fetched the highest price--one hundred and\r\nfifty-seven pounds, ten shillings. Some other notable books in this\r\nmarvellous library were the Dante, printed at Florence in 1481, which\r\nrealised forty pounds, nineteen shillings; the first edition of the\r\n_Teseide_ of Boccaccio, which was disposed of for one hundred and sixty\r\npounds; a very fine copy of Smith's _Historie of Virginia_, which sold\r\nfor thirteen guineas; and the first four folio Shakespeares. The prices\r\nobtained for these were eighty-five pounds, one shilling; thirteen\r\npounds; twenty-four pounds; and three pounds, nine shillings.\r\n\r\nThe more important manuscripts were _Praeparatio ad Missam_, written and\r\nilluminated for Pope Leo X., which fetched ninety-nine pounds, fifteen\r\nshillings; _Droits d'Armes et de Noblesse_, ninety-four pounds, ten\r\nshillings; _Roman de la Rose_, eighty-four pounds; _Missale Romanum_,\r\nsixty-one pounds, nineteen shillings; and _Romant des Trois\r\nPelerinages_, thirty-one pounds, ten shillings. These were all written\r\non vellum.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 Mr. Hibbert printed for the Roxburghe Club, from a manuscript\r\npreserved in the Pepysian Library at Magdalen College, Cambridge, _Six\r\nBookes of Metamorphoseos by Ovyde_, translated from the French by\r\nCaxton, together with some prefatory remarks by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. CHARLES BURNEY, D.D., 1757-1817\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Burney, the second son of Charles Burney, the author of _The\r\nHistory of Music_, was born at Lynn, Norfolk, in the early part of\r\nDecember (the exact date is uncertain) 1757. He was educated at the\r\nCharterhouse, and Caius College, Cambridge, but left the University\r\nwithout taking a degree. He afterwards became a student of King's\r\nCollege, Aberdeen, where he graduated M.A. in 1781. After leaving the\r\nCollege he devoted himself to educational work, and for a short time was\r\nan assistant master at Highgate School, which he left to join Dr.\r\nWilliam Rose, the translator of Sallust, in his school at Chiswick. In\r\n1786, having married Rose's second daughter in 1783, he opened a school\r\nof his own at Hammersmith, which he carried on until 1793, when he\r\nremoved to Greenwich, and there established a very flourishing academy,\r\nwhich in 1813 he made over to his son, the Rev. Charles Parr Burney.\r\nLate in life (1807) Burney took orders, and was appointed to the Rectory\r\nof St. Paul's, Deptford, Kent, and in a short time after to the Rectory\r\nof Cliffe in the same county. In 1811 he was made Chaplain to the King,\r\nand in 1817, a few months before his death, he was collated to a\r\nprebendal stall in Lincoln Cathedral. He received the degree of LL.D.\r\nfrom the Universities of Aberdeen and Glasgow in 1792, the degree of\r\nM.A. was conferred on him by Cambridge University in 1808, and that of\r\nD.D. by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1812. Burney, who was the friend\r\nand companion of Dr. Parr and Professor Porson, wrote several works on\r\nthe Greek and Latin Classics, as well as one or two of a theological\r\nnature. He died of apoplexy at Deptford on the 28th of December 1817,\r\nand a monument to his memory was erected in Westminster Abbey by a\r\nnumber of his old scholars.\r\n\r\nDr. Burney realised a considerable fortune by his scholastic work, and\r\nthe money which he thus acquired enabled him to form a library of nearly\r\nthirteen thousand five hundred volumes of printed books, and five\r\nhundred and twenty manuscripts. Among the latter was the Towneley Homer,\r\nbelieved to be of the thirteenth century, and valued at six hundred\r\nguineas. The library was particularly rich in the Greek Classics,\r\nespecially the dramatists; comprising as many as one hundred and\r\nsixty-six editions of Euripides, one hundred and two of Sophocles, and\r\nforty-seven of AEschylus, the margins of a large proportion of the\r\nclassical books being covered with notes in Burney's hand, in addition\r\nto those by the Stephens, Bentley, Markland, and others. Another very\r\ninteresting feature of the library was the large number of English\r\nnewspapers it contained. These papers, which reached from the reign of\r\nJames I. until nearly the end of that of George III., were bound in\r\nabout seven hundred volumes, and now form the basis of the splendid\r\ncollection in the British Museum. Dr. Burney also amassed from three to\r\nfour hundred volumes containing materials for a history of the British\r\nStage, and several thousand portraits of literary and theatrical\r\npersonages. On the death of the Doctor his library was purchased for the\r\nBritish Museum for the sum of thirteen thousand five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE JOHN, SECOND EARL SPENCER, 1758-1834\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge John, second Earl Spencer, was born on the 1st of September 1758.\r\nHe was the only son of John Spencer, who was created Viscount Spencer of\r\nAlthorp in 1761, and Earl Spencer in 1765, and grandson of John, the\r\nyoungest son of Charles Spencer, third Earl of Sunderland. At seven\r\nyears of age he was placed under the tutorship of William Jones, the\r\nfamous Orientalist, who was afterwards knighted, with whom he made two\r\nContinental tours. Jones resigned his charge in 1770, when Lord Althorp\r\nwas sent to Harrow, and, on leaving school, to Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. In 1780 he entered Parliament as member for Northampton, and\r\non the formation of the second Rockingham Ministry in March 1782 he\r\nbecame a Commissioner of the new Treasury Board. On the death of his\r\nfather in 1783, Lord Althorp (who had married in 1781 Lavinia, eldest\r\ndaughter of Charles, first Lord Lucan) succeeded to the title, and in\r\n1784 was sent with Mr. Thomas Grenville on a special mission to the\r\nCourt of Vienna. During his absence from England, on the 19th of July in\r\nthat year, he was made Lord Privy Seal in Mr. Pitt's Ministry, which\r\noffice he resigned in the following December for that of First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty, a post which he held with great credit for upwards of six\r\nyears. After his retirement from the Admiralty in February 1801, Lord\r\nSpencer remained out of office until February 1806, when he accepted the\r\nSecretaryship of State for the Home Department in the Grenville-Fox\r\nMinistry. On the dissolution of that ministry in March 1807, he finally\r\nretired from office, but continued to take part in the debates in the\r\nHouse of Lords. He died on the 10th of November 1834, and was succeeded\r\nby his eldest son John Charles.\r\n\r\nLord Spencer was a most energetic and enlightened collector of books,\r\nand the magnificent library which, until the year 1892, was one of the\r\nglories of Althorp, testifies to the skill and liberality with which he\r\ncollected them. A taste for literature and a love of books were\r\ndeveloped in Lord Spencer at an early age, and he was but thirty-two\r\nwhen he acquired the choice collection of Count Reviczky, a Hungarian\r\nnobleman, which at once placed his library among the more important\r\nprivate collections of the time. He also bought largely at the Mason,\r\nHerbert, Roxburghe, Alchorne, and other sales, and after the dispersion\r\nof the famous library at White Knights in 1819 he was able to acquire,\r\nat a cost of seven hundred and fifty pounds, the copy of the Valdarfer\r\nBoccaccio for which he had vainly bid two thousand two hundred and fifty\r\npounds seven years before at the Roxburghe sale. In the years 1819 and\r\n1820 he made a bibliographical tour on the Continent, during which,\r\namong other purchases, he acquired the library of the Duke of\r\nCassano-Serra, which contained some very rare fifteenth century books.\r\n\r\nLord Spencer was considerably assisted in the formation of his famous\r\ncollection by his librarian, the well-known Dr. Thomas Frognall Dibdin,\r\nthe author of _Bibliomania, The Bibliographical Decameron_, and other\r\npleasant and gossiping, but somewhat verbose and not particularly\r\naccurate, works on books, their printers and owners. Dibdin's services\r\nwere liberally rewarded; and Edwards, in his work _Libraries and\r\nFounders of Libraries_, states that in addition to his stipend as\r\nlibrarian, 'Lord Spencer insured his librarian's life for the advantage\r\nof his family. Lord Spencer also gave him the vicarage of Exning, in\r\nSuffolk, in 1823, and obtained for him, on Episcopal recommendation, the\r\nrectory of St. Mary, Bryanstone Square, at the end of the same year.'\r\nDibdin was the first to suggest the establishment of the Roxburghe Club,\r\nof which he became vice-president. He died in 1847.\r\n\r\nThe collection at Althorp, which Renouard described as 'the most\r\nbeautiful and richest private library in Europe,' amounted in 1892 to\r\nabout forty-one thousand five hundred volumes. Other private libraries\r\nhave possessed more books, but none could boast of choicer ones. It\r\ncontained the earliest dated example of wood-engraving--the figure of\r\nSt. Christopher, with the date 1423; and no less than fourteen\r\nblock-books, comprising three editions of the _Ars Moriendi_, three of\r\nthe _Speculum Humanae Salvationis_, two of the _Apocalypsis S. Johannis_,\r\ntogether with copies of the _Biblia Pauperum_, _Ars Memorandi_,\r\n_Historia Virginis ex Cantico Canticorum_, _Wie die fuenfzehen zaichen\r\nkimen vor dem hingsten tag_, the _Enndchrist_, and _Mirabilia Romae_. It\r\nwas particularly rich in Bibles, among which were the Gutenberg and\r\nBamberg Bibles, the Coverdale Bible of 1535, and a magnificent copy of\r\nthe Antwerp Polyglot, once the property of De Thou. It also contained\r\nthe first and second Mentz Psalters. The Classics, too, were splendidly\r\nrepresented. The editions of works by Cicero numbered upwards of\r\nseventy, about fifty of which were printed before 1473; while fifteen of\r\nthose of Virgil were prior to the year 1476. Among these were the second\r\nedition by Sweynheym and Pannartz, most probably printed in 1471, which\r\nis not less rare than the first, and the famous 'Adam' edition, which\r\nissued from the press in that year. These two volumes were obtained from\r\nthe library of the King of Wirtemberg, Dibdin making a special journey\r\nto Stuttgart to purchase them. The library also possessed a large number\r\nof the early editions of Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and other Italian\r\nClassics; and no less than fifty-two Caxtons, three of them unique, were\r\nto be found on its shelves. A splendid descriptive catalogue of the\r\nlibrary, entitled 'Bibliotheca Spenceriana,' was compiled by Dibdin in\r\nthe years 1814-23.\r\n\r\nLord Spencer maintained his interest in his books to the end of his\r\nlife, and in the year before that of his death he wrote to Dibdin, 'I am\r\ntrying my hand at a Classed Catalogue.'\r\n\r\nIn August 1892 this noble collection was purchased by Mrs. Rylands,\r\nwidow of the late Mr. John Rylands, of Longford Hall, near Manchester,\r\nfor a sum which was said to be little less than a quarter of a million\r\nsterling; and on the 6th of October 1899 she presented it, together\r\nwith a handsome building for its reception, to the city of Manchester,\r\nin memory of her husband. An excellent catalogue, both of the printed\r\nbooks and the manuscripts, in three handsome quarto volumes, compiled by\r\nMr. Gordon Duff, the librarian, accompanied this munificent gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD COLT HOARE, BART., 1758-1838\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Richard Colt Hoare, Bart., the historian of Wiltshire, was born on\r\nthe 9th of December 1758. He was the son of Richard Hoare, Esq., of Barn\r\nElms, Surrey (who was created a baronet in 1786), by Anne, second\r\ndaughter of Henry Hoare, Esq., of Stourhead, Wiltshire, and of Susanna,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Stephen Colt, Esq. He was privately educated,\r\nand at an early age entered the family bank (Messrs. Hoare's Bank, Fleet\r\nStreet, London). In his work, _Pedigrees and Memoirs of the Families of\r\nHore_, etc., he writes:--'Blessed by my parents with the advantages of a\r\ngood education, I thereby acquired a love of literature and of drawing;\r\nof which, in my more advanced years, I feel the inestimable advantage.\r\nDestined, as I imagined, for an active and commercial life, I was\r\nunexpectedly and agreeably surprised to hear, shortly after my\r\nmarriage, that my generous grandfather had intentions to remove me from\r\nthe banking business, and to settle me on his estate in Wiltshire; which\r\nhe put into execution during his lifetime, by making over to me all his\r\nlanded property, with their appendages, at Stourhead and in the\r\nadjoining counties.' In 1783 Hoare married Hester, only daughter of Lord\r\nWestcote, afterwards created Lord Lyttelton, who died in 1785, leaving a\r\nson Henry Richard. In 1787, on the death of his father, he succeeded to\r\nthe baronetcy. After the decease of his wife he made an extensive tour\r\non the Continent, visiting France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain. In 1787\r\nhe returned home, but in the following year he paid a second visit to\r\nthe Continent, and did not return to England until August 1791. During\r\nthese tours he made a large number of drawings of interesting objects,\r\nand 'for the gratification of his family and friends' printed an account\r\nof his travels in four volumes. When he was no longer able to travel on\r\nthe Continent in consequence of the French revolutionary war, Sir R.C.\r\nHoare made a tour through Wales, taking Giraldus Cambrensis as a guide,\r\nand in 1806 he published a translation of the _Itinerarium Cambriae_ of\r\nGiraldus in two handsome volumes. He also contributed sixty-three\r\ndrawings to Archdeacon Coxe's _Historical Tour in Monmouthshire_, which\r\nappeared in 1801. In 1807 he paid a visit to Ireland, and printed a\r\nshort account of his excursion. In 1812 Hoare published in London the\r\nfirst part of his great work, the _Ancient History of Wiltshire_, which\r\nhe completed in two volumes in 1821. This was followed by the _Modern\r\nHistory of Wiltshire_ in fourteen parts, London, 1822-24, which was left\r\nunfinished at the time of his death. Hoare was the author of many works\r\nin addition to those already mentioned, some of which were intended only\r\nfor private circulation. A list of them will be found in the Catalogue\r\nof the Hoare Library at Stourhead, compiled by John Bowyer Nichols in\r\n1840. Hoare, who was a Fellow of the Royal Society and of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, died at Stourhead on the 19th of May 1838. His only son\r\npredeceased him, and the baronetcy and estates devolved on his eldest\r\nhalf-brother, Henry Hugh Hoare of Wavendon, Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\nSir R.C. Hoare possessed a noble library at Stourhead. The foundation of\r\nit no doubt was laid by his grandfather, Henry Hoare, whose bookplate\r\noccurs on many of the volumes, but it was Sir R.C. Hoare who brought\r\ntogether the magnificent collection of books on British topography,\r\nwhich was probably the finest private one ever formed. The water-colour\r\ndrawings, the books of prints, and the engravings in the library were\r\nremarkable for their beauty, and had been selected with great judgment\r\nand taste. During his travels on the Continent between the years 1785\r\nand 1791 Hoare acquired a large number of books relative to the history\r\nand topography of Italy. Of these he printed in 1812 a separate\r\ncatalogue, the impression of which was limited to twelve copies. In 1825\r\nhe presented this collection to the British Museum, together with a copy\r\nof the catalogue, upon the fly-leaf of which he has written:--'Anxious\r\nto follow the liberal example of our gracious monarch George the Fourth,\r\nof Sir George Beaumont, Bart., of Richd. Payne Knight, Esq. (tho' in a\r\nvery humble degree) I do give unto the British Museum, this my\r\nCollection of Topography, made during a residence of five years\r\nabroad--and hoping that the more modern publications may be added to it\r\nhereafter. Rich. Colt Hoare, A.D. 1825.' The Stourhead library was sold\r\nby auction on Monday, the 30th of July 1883 and seven following days, by\r\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. The books, engravings and drawings, of\r\nwhich there were one thousand nine hundred and seventy-one lots,\r\nrealised ten thousand and twenty-eight pounds, six shillings and\r\nsixpence. On the 9th of December 1887, and three following days, some\r\nmore books belonging to the library were sold for one thousand three\r\nhundred and ninety-two pounds, eleven shillings and sixpence. The prices\r\nobtained for many of the books were exceptionally high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BECKFORD, 1759-1844\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Beckford, the author of _Vathek_, was born at Fonthill,\r\nWiltshire on the 29th of September 1759. He was the only legitimate\r\nchild of Alderman William Beckford, who was twice Lord Mayor of London,\r\nand who died in 1770, leaving his son property worth upwards of one\r\nhundred thousand pounds a year. Beckford amassed at his residence at\r\nFonthill a magnificent collection of books, pictures, furniture and\r\ncuriosities of all kinds, but his extravagance and the depreciation of\r\nhis West India property compelled him in 1823 to sell Fonthill and the\r\ngreater part of its contents. He, however, retained a portion of his\r\nlibrary and the best of his pictures, and removed them to Lansdown\r\nTower, Bath, which he built on leaving Fonthill, and where he continued\r\nto add to his collections. Beckford married in 1783 Margaret, daughter\r\nof Charles, fourth Earl of Aboyne, by whom he had two daughters--Margaret\r\nand Susan Euphemia--the elder of whom married Colonel Orde, and the\r\nyounger the Marquis of Douglas, who afterwards became Duke of Hamilton.\r\nThe elder daughter having offended her father by her marriage with\r\nColonel Orde, he left all his property to the Duchess of Hamilton.\r\nAfter Beckford's death on May the 2nd, 1844, the Duke of Hamilton\r\nwished to sell the library to Mr. Henry Bohn, who was willing to give\r\nthirty thousand pounds for it, but the Duchess objected to part with\r\nher father's books, and they were removed to Hamilton Palace, but\r\nkept separate from the noble library which already existed there.\r\nIn the years 1882, 1883 and 1884 both these splendid collections\r\nwere sold. The sale, or rather sales, of the Beckford books, for the\r\ncollection was divided into four portions, took place at the auction\r\nrooms of Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, and lasted altogether forty days;\r\nthe first sale commencing on the 30th of June 1882 and lasting twelve\r\ndays, and the last on the 27th of November 1883, and continuing for four\r\ndays. The total number of lots in the four sales was nine thousand eight\r\nhundred and thirty-seven, and the amount realised seventy-three thousand\r\nfive hundred and fifty-one pounds, eighteen shillings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM BECKFORD. From a Medallion by Singleton.]\r\n\r\nBeckford's library was rich in fine early printed books, rare voyages\r\nand travels, and choice French, Spanish and Italian works, but it was\r\nchiefly remarkable for its superb collection of beautiful and historical\r\nbindings. It contained a large number of volumes from the libraries of\r\nGrolier, Maioli, Lauwrin, Canevari, De Thou, Peiresc, and other\r\ndistinguished collectors, and also examples of bindings bearing the arms\r\nand devices of Francis I. of France, Henry II. and Diana of Poitiers,\r\nCharles IX., Henry III., Henry IV., Louis XIII., Anne of Austria, etc.;\r\nmany of the volumes being bound by Nicolas and Clovis Eve, Le Gascon,\r\nPadeloup, Derome, Monnier and other famous French binders. Very high\r\nprices were obtained for many of these splendid books--_Lactantii\r\nOpera_, printed in the Monastery of Subiaco by Sweynheym and Pannartz in\r\n1465, sold for two hundred and eighty-five pounds; _Biblia Latina_,\r\nprinted on vellum by N. Jenson at Venice in 1476, three hundred and\r\nthirty pounds; _Livre de Bien Vivre_, on vellum, finely illuminated,\r\nParis, A. Verard, 1492, three hundred and thirty pounds; _Philostrati\r\nVita Apollonii Tyanei_, printed by Aldus at Venice in 1502, Grolier's\r\ncopy, bound in red morocco, three hundred pounds; _Lucanus_, printed by\r\nAldus in 1515, Grolier's copy, bound in marbled calf, two hundred and\r\nninety pounds; _Tirante il Bianco_, Vinegia, 1538, red morocco, from the\r\nlibrary of Demetrio Canevari, one hundred and eleven pounds; _Entree de\r\nHenry II. en Paris 6 Juing_ 1549, etc., with the arms and cypher of de\r\nThou on the binding, four hundred and seventy pounds; _Psalmorum\r\nParaphrasis Poetica_, by G. Buchanan, beautifully bound in olive\r\nmorocco, with the arms and cypher of De Thou, three hundred and ten\r\npounds; _Livre de la Conqueste de la Toison d'Or par le Prince Jason_,\r\npar J. Gohory, Paris, 1563, in a beautiful binding by Nicolas Eve, with\r\nthe arms of the Duke of Guise painted on the covers, four hundred and\r\nfive pounds; _Poliphile Hypnerotomachie_, Paris, 1561, bound in blue\r\nmorocco by Nicolas Eve for Louise de Lorraine, two hundred and twenty\r\npounds; _Portraits des Rois, Hommes et Dames Illustres_, etc., a series\r\nof the engraved works of Sir Anthony Vandyck, including his own\r\netchings, in three large folio volumes, two thousand eight hundred and\r\nfifty pounds; _Decor Puellarum_, printed by N. Jenson at Venice in 1471,\r\nin a splendid binding by Monnier--blue morocco, with flowers in various\r\nleathers, and with silk linings, five hundred and thirty pounds; and\r\n_Longi Pastoralia_, printed on vellum by P. Didot at Paris for Junot,\r\nDuke of Abrantes, with drawings by Prud'hon and F. Gerard, nine hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nBeckford wrote other works besides _Vathek_, several of which he left in\r\nmanuscript, and a large number of his books contained notes in his\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK NORTH, FIFTH EARL OF GUILFORD, 1766-1827\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick North, fifth Earl of Guilford, was born on the 7th of February\r\n1766. He was the third and youngest son of Frederick, second Earl, Prime\r\nMinister from January 1770 to March 1782. When his health, which was\r\nvery delicate, permitted, he went to Eton, and afterwards became a\r\nstudent of Christ Church, Oxford. He was created D.C.L. in 1793, and\r\nreceived the same degree by diploma in 1819. In 1779, through his\r\nfather's interest, he obtained the sinecure of one of the Chamberlains\r\nof the Tally Court of the Exchequer, and in 1794 he was appointed to the\r\nComptrollership of the Customs of the Port of London, when he resigned\r\nthe representation of the family borough of Banbury, to which he had\r\nsucceeded when his eldest brother, George Augustus, came to the Earldom\r\nin 1792. North was Secretary of State to the Viceroy of the Ionian\r\nIslands during 1795 and 1796, and in 1798 he was made Governor of\r\nCeylon, a post he held until July 1805. On the death of his brother\r\nFrancis, the fourth Earl, in 1817, he succeeded to the Earldom of\r\nGuilford, and in 1819 he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order\r\nof St. Michael and St. George. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and\r\na Member of the Eumelean Club. Lord Guilford, who had been received into\r\nthe Eastern Church at Corfu in 1791, died unmarried in London on the\r\n14th of October 1827, and was succeeded by his cousin, the Rev. Francis\r\nNorth, Prebendary of Winchester and Master of the Hospital of St. Cross.\r\nLord Guilford was a distinguished scholar, and a most accomplished\r\nlinguist. He took the greatest interest in everything relating to Greek\r\nliterature and art, and it was principally through his exertions, and\r\nwith his money, that a University was founded in 1824 at Corfu, of which\r\nhe was the first chancellor, and in which he resided until 1827, when he\r\nwas obliged to return to England on account of his health. He left his\r\ncollections of printed books, manuscripts, etc., at Corfu to the\r\nUniversity, but in consequence of its failure to comply with certain\r\nconditions which accompanied the bequest, it was not carried out. Lord\r\nGuilford's fine library was sold by Evans, in seven parts, in the years\r\n1828, 1829, 1830, and 1835. The first sale took place on December 15th,\r\n1828, and eight following days; and the others on January 12th, 1829,\r\nand five following days; February 28th, 1829, and two following days;\r\nDecember 8th, 1830, and four following days; December 20th, 1830, and\r\nfour following days; January 5th, 1831, and three following days; and\r\nNovember 9th, 1835, and seven following days. The last three sales were\r\nof the manuscripts and books removed from Corfu. There were eight\r\nthousand five hundred and eleven lots in the seven sales, which realised\r\ntwelve thousand one hundred and seventy-eight pounds, ten shillings and\r\nsixpence.\r\n\r\nLord Guilford's collection was an excellent one, and, as might be\r\nexpected, the Greek manuscripts in it were particularly numerous and\r\nchoice. The printed books were good, but they were not equal to the\r\nmanuscripts either in interest or value. Among the latter was the\r\noriginal manuscript of Tasso's _Gerusalemme Liberata_, with some\r\nalterations of verses in the margin, likewise in the handwriting of\r\nTasso. This sold for two hundred and four pounds, fifteen shillings.\r\nFour Greek manuscripts of the eleventh century: a copy of the Four\r\nGospels; the Greek Offices, with Intonations or Musical Directions for\r\nChanting; an Evangelistarium and Menologium of the Greek Church; and\r\nJosephus's _Historia de Bello Judaico_, deserve special notice on\r\naccount of their beauty and rarity. These fetched at the sale\r\nrespectively one hundred and two pounds, eighteen shillings; one hundred\r\nand seventy-three pounds, five shillings; seventy-three pounds, ten\r\nshillings; and two hundred and seventy-three pounds. Another interesting\r\nmanuscript was a copy of the New Testament in Glagolitic characters,\r\nwhich realised one hundred and sixty-eight pounds. Among the printed\r\nbooks may be mentioned a large paper copy of the first edition of the\r\nSixtine Bible, printed at Rome in 1590, and suppressed by order of\r\nGregory XIV., on account of the numerous inaccuracies in it, which\r\nrealised sixty-three pounds; and the Duke of Northumberland's _Concio ad\r\nPopulum Londinensem_, printed at Rome in 1570, of which the only other\r\nknown copy is in the library of the Vatican, for which forty-two pounds\r\nwas obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SPENCER CHURCHILL, FIFTH DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, 1766-1840\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Spencer Churchill, fifth Duke of Marlborough, the collector of\r\nthe famous library at White Knights, near Reading, Berkshire, was the\r\nelder son of George, fourth Duke of Marlborough, by Caroline, only\r\ndaughter of John, fourth Duke of Bedford. He was born on the 6th of\r\nMarch 1766, and was educated at Eton, and subsequently at Christ Church,\r\nOxford, graduating M.A. in 1786 and D.C.L. in 1792. At the general\r\nelection in 1790 he was returned to Parliament as one of the members for\r\nOxfordshire, and in August 1804 he was appointed a Lord of the Treasury,\r\nwhich office he held until February 1806. On the 12th of March in the\r\nsame year he was called to the House of Lords as Baron Spencer of\r\nWormleighton, and on the death of his father on the 29th of January 1817\r\nhe succeeded to the dukedom. In the May following he was authorised to\r\ntake and use the name of Churchill after that of Spencer, and to bear\r\nthe arms of Churchill quarterly with those of Spencer, in order to\r\nperpetuate in his family the surname of his celebrated ancestor, John,\r\nfirst Duke of Marlborough. He married, on the 15th of September 1791,\r\nSusan, second daughter of John, seventh Earl of Galloway, by whom he had\r\nissue four sons and two daughters. He died on the 5th of March 1840, and\r\nwas succeeded by his eldest son, George.\r\n\r\nThe splendid library which the Duke of Marlborough, while Marquis of\r\nBlandford, collected at White Knights was one of the finest in the\r\nkingdom. Its two great treasures were the Bedford Book of Hours, now in\r\nthe British Museum, purchased by the Duke in 1815 at the sale of the\r\nlibrary of James Edwards, for the sum of six hundred and ninety-eight\r\npounds, five shillings; and the edition of Boccaccio's _Decameron_,\r\nprinted by Valdarfer at Venice in 1471, which he acquired at the Duke of\r\nRoxburghe's sale in 1812, after a spirited contest with his relative,\r\nEarl Spencer, at the enormous price of two thousand two hundred and\r\nsixty pounds. This copy, Edward Edwards tells us (_Libraries and\r\nFounders of Libraries_), had been offered to Lord Sunderland for a\r\nhundred guineas just a century before one of his great-grandsons offered\r\nmore than two thousand guineas for it, and was outbidden by another.\r\nAmong many other choice manuscripts and rare books the library contained\r\na beautiful Missal, said to have been executed for Diana of Poitiers; no\r\nfewer than eighteen Caxtons; the _Bokys of Hawkyng and Huntyng_, printed\r\nat St. Albans in 1486; a large number of very rare books from the\r\npresses of Machlinia, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde, and other early English\r\nprinters; a copy on vellum of the first edition of Luther's translation\r\nof the Bible after his final revision; a collection of Churchyard's\r\nWorks in two volumes; many of the early editions of Shakespeare's plays,\r\ntogether with the first edition of his _Sonnets_; and Ireland's account\r\nof the Shakesperian Forgery, in his own handwriting. The collection was\r\nespecially rich in missals, books of emblems, and Italian, Spanish, and\r\nFrench romances of chivalry, poetry, and facetiae.\r\n\r\nThe extravagance of the Duke compelled him to dispose of his magnificent\r\ncollection during his lifetime, and it was sold in two parts by Mr.\r\nEvans at 26 Pall Mall. The sale, which consisted of four thousand seven\r\nhundred and one lots, commenced on the 7th of June 1819 and lasted till\r\nthe 3rd of July following. It realised but fourteen thousand four\r\nhundred and eighty-two pounds, ten shillings and sixpence, a much less\r\nsum than that paid for the books by the Duke. The Valdarfer Boccaccio\r\nsold for nine hundred and eighteen pounds, fifteen shillings, and the\r\nCaxtons fetched one thousand three hundred and sixteen pounds, twelve\r\nshillings and sixpence; the highest prices being obtained for Gower's\r\n_Confessio Amantis_, and Chaucer's _Troylus and Creside_, which realised\r\ntwo hundred and five pounds, sixteen shillings, and one hundred and\r\nsixty-two pounds, fifteen shillings. The Book of St. Albans, which was\r\nimperfect, fetched eighty-four pounds; Luther's translation of the\r\nBible, two hundred and twenty pounds, ten shillings; Churchyard's Works,\r\neighty-five pounds, one shilling; and Shakespeare's _Sonnets_,\r\nthirty-seven pounds. The Missal said to have been written for Diana of\r\nPoitiers sold for one hundred and ten pounds, five shillings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER, TENTH DUKE OF HAMILTON, 1767-1852\r\n\r\n\r\nA good library had no doubt existed in Hamilton Palace for a\r\nconsiderable period of time, but Alexander, tenth Duke of Hamilton, who\r\nwas born on the 5th of October 1767, and died on the 18th of August\r\n1852, was the first of his line who was a book-collector on an extensive\r\nscale. He formed a large and very choice collection of printed books,\r\nbut that of his manuscripts was of still greater interest and value. It\r\nwas wonderfully rich in Bibles and portions of the Scriptures, Missals,\r\nBreviaries and Books of Hours, many of them having been written and\r\nilluminated for Francis I., King of France, the Emperor Maximilian, Pope\r\nLeo X., the Duke of Guise, and other distinguished personages. The\r\nfinest of these was a copy of the Gospels in Latin, known as 'The Golden\r\nGospels,' written about the end of the eighth century in gold letters\r\nupon purple vellum, which was at one time the property of King Henry\r\nVIII. Another famous manuscript in the library, valued at five thousand\r\npounds, was the _Divina Commedia_ of Dante, illustrated with upwards of\r\neighty original designs attributed to Sandro Botticelli, now in the\r\nRoyal Library at Berlin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his own books, the Duke acquired the whole of William\r\nBeckford's splendid collection by his marriage with Beckford's daughter\r\nSusan Euphemia. William, the eleventh Duke, who was born on February the\r\n19th, 1811, and died on July the 15th, 1863, added considerably to the\r\nlibrary, but his successor was reluctantly obliged to part with it, and\r\nit was advertised to be sold by auction on June 30th, 1882. Before,\r\nhowever, the time appointed for the sale, the Royal Museum at Berlin, by\r\na private arrangement, acquired the whole of the manuscripts for a sum\r\nwhich is believed to have amounted to about seventy-five thousand\r\npounds, and they were divided between that Institution and the Royal\r\nLibrary at Berlin. A portion of them, which related to Scottish history,\r\nwas purchased of the Prussian authorities by the British Museum; and\r\nninety-one other manuscripts which were not required by the Berlin\r\nMuseum, including the 'Golden Gospels,' were sent to Sotheby, Wilkinson\r\nand Hodge, by whom they were sold on the 23rd of May 1889 for fifteen\r\nthousand one hundred and eighty-nine pounds, ten shillings and sixpence.\r\nThe 'Golden Gospels' was bought by Mr. Quaritch for one thousand five\r\nhundred pounds. The printed books were sold by the same auctioneers on\r\nMay 1st, 1884, and seven following days. The sale consisted of two\r\nthousand one hundred and thirty-six lots, and realised twelve thousand\r\neight hundred and ninety-two pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence. The\r\nfollowing are a few of the rarest and most interesting books, and the\r\nprices they fetched--_Boecius de Consolatione Philosophie_, printed by\r\nCaxton in 1477-78, one hundred and sixty pounds; Dante's _Commedia_,\r\nprinted at Florence in 1481, with twenty engravings by Baccio Baldini,\r\nthree hundred and eighty pounds; the Poems of Pindar in Greek, printed\r\nby Aldus in 1513, with the arms of France and the monogram and devices\r\nof Henry II. and Diana of Poitiers on the binding, one hundred and\r\nforty-one pounds; the Prince of Conde's copy of _L'Hystoire du Roy\r\nPerceforest_, Paris, 1528, with his arms on the covers, one hundred and\r\neighteen pounds; a dedication copy, printed upon vellum, and bound for\r\nJames V., King of Scotland, of Hector Boece's _History and Croniklis_,\r\ntranslated by Bellenden, and printed at Edinburgh in 1536, the binding\r\nhaving on the upper cover IACOBVS QVINTVS, and on the lower REX\r\nSCOTORVM, eight hundred pounds; a Collection of Architectural Designs,\r\nexecuted with pen and ink by J. Androuet du Cerceau, in a beautiful\r\nbinding attributed to Clovis Eve, two hundred and forty pounds; De Bry's\r\n_Collectiones Peregrinationum_, in eleven volumes, bound in blue morocco\r\nby Derome, five hundred and sixty pounds; Book of Common Prayer, 1637,\r\nfolio--King Charles I.'s copy, with numerous alterations in his own\r\nhandwriting which were used in printing the Scottish Prayer-book of the\r\nsame year, usually termed Laud's Book. Prefixed to the Order for Morning\r\nPrayer the King has written: 'Charles R.--I gave the Archbp. of\r\nCanterbury comand to make the alteracons expressed in this Book and to\r\nfit a Liturgy for the Church of Scotland, and wheresoever they shall\r\ndiffer from another Booke signed by us at Hampt. Court Septembr. 28,\r\n1634, our pleasure is to have these followed rather than the former;\r\nunless the Archbp. of St. Andrews and his Brethren who are upon the\r\nplace shall see apparent reason to the contrary. At Whitehall, April 19,\r\n1636'--one hundred and thirty-seven pounds.\r\n\r\nThe paintings and objects of art belonging to the Duke of Hamilton were\r\nsold in July 1882, and realised three hundred and ninety-seven thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR MARK MASTERMAN SYKES, BART., 1771-1823\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Mark Masterman Sykes, Bart., was the eldest son of Sir Christopher\r\nSykes, second baronet, of Sledmere, Yorkshire. He was born on the 20th\r\nof August 1771, and in his seventeenth year was sent to Brasenose\r\nCollege, Oxford. In 1795 he served the office of High Sheriff of\r\nYorkshire, and on the death of his father in 1801 he succeeded to the\r\ntitle and estates. He was elected Member of Parliament for the city of\r\nYork in 1807; was again returned in 1812 and 1813, and retired on\r\naccount of ill health in 1820. Sir M. Masterman Sykes was twice married.\r\nHis first wife was Henrietta, daughter and heiress of Henry Masterman of\r\nSettrington, Yorkshire, and on his union with her in 1795 he assumed the\r\nadditional name of Masterman. She died in 1813, and in the following\r\nyear he married Mary Elizabeth, daughter of William Tatton Egerton, and\r\nsister of Wilbraham Tatton Egerton, of Tatton Park, who survived him.\r\nSir Mark died at Weymouth, on his way to London, on the 16th of February\r\n1823. He had no children, and was succeeded by his brother, Sir Tatton\r\nSykes.\r\n\r\nSir M. Masterman Sykes early developed a love for books, and the\r\nmagnificent library which he formed, one of the finest private\r\ncollections in England, was the result of upwards of thirty years'\r\nunremitting and careful work. Some of the rare volumes it contained, we\r\nare informed in the preface to the sale catalogue of his library written\r\nby the Rev. H.J. Todd, 'were procured during the collector's travels\r\nabroad, but many of them were acquired at the dispersion of the\r\nlibraries of Major Pearson, Dr. Farmer, Steevens, Reed, the Rev. Mr.\r\nBrand, the Duke of Roxburghe and others, but especially of that of the\r\nlate Mr. Edwards, from whom the celebrated Livy of 1469 was\r\nobtained--the only known copy of the first edition of Livy on vellum.'\r\n\r\nAmong the principal treasures of the collection were the Gutenberg\r\nBible; the Psalter of 1459, on vellum; the _Rationale Divinorum\r\nOfficiorum_ of Durandus, on vellum, 1459; the _Catholicon_ of Joannes\r\nBalbus de Janua, 1460; the Latin Bible of 1462, on vellum; and the\r\nEpistles of St. Jerome, on vellum, 1470: all printed at Mentz.\r\n\r\nThe library was especially rich in early editions of the Greek and Latin\r\nClassics, and on its shelves were to be found the only copy known to\r\nexist on vellum of the first edition of Livy, printed at Rome by\r\nSweynheym and Pannartz about 1469, to which we have already referred;\r\nthe first edition of Pliny, printed by Joannes de Spira at Venice in\r\n1469; that printed at Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz in 1470; a copy on\r\nvellum of the beautiful 1472 edition from the press of Nicolas Jenson of\r\nVenice; and the earliest editions of Homer, Cicero, Horace, Virgil,\r\nTacitus, Terence, and Valerius Maximus.\r\n\r\nThe library also contained the Dante printed at Foligno in 1472, and\r\nthat printed at Florence in 1481; the first issue of the Latin\r\ntranslation of the Letter of Columbus, printed at Rome in 1493; a fine\r\ncopy of the _Poliphili Hypnerotomachia_, printed by Aldus at Venice in\r\n1499; the Aldine Petrarch of 1501; several rare Missals and Books of\r\nHours, the most notable of them being a vellum copy of the Vallombrosa\r\nMissal, printed at Florence in 1503; and a copy of the _Tewrdannck_,\r\nalso on vellum, printed at Nuremberg in 1517.\r\n\r\nThere were several Caxtons, among them being _The Myrrour of the World_\r\nand Higden's _Polychronicon_.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. was well\r\nrepresented, and the library contained a copy of that rare work,\r\nArchbishop Parker's _De Antiquitate Ecclesiae Britannicae_.\r\n\r\nThe collection also comprised several fine and interesting manuscripts.\r\nDeserving especial notice were a beautiful illuminated Office, on\r\nvellum, of the Virgin Mary, executed for Francis I., King of France; the\r\noriginal Report of Convocation to Henry VIII. on the Legality of his\r\nproposed Divorce from Anne of Cleves, subscribed with the autograph\r\nsignatures of the Archbishop and all the Bishops and Clergy assembled in\r\nConvocation, dated July 9th, 1540; and an autograph manuscript of\r\nDugdale's Visitation of the County of York in 1665-66.\r\n\r\nSir M. Masterman Sykes possessed an immense collection of prints. It\r\nincluded a complete set of Bartolozzi's engravings which is said to have\r\ncost Sir Mark nearly five thousand pounds; his collection of portraits\r\nwas considered to be one of the best in the kingdom; and Dibdin declared\r\nthat his 'Faithornes and Hollars almost defied competition.' He also\r\naccumulated a considerable number of pictures, bronzes, coins and\r\nmedals.\r\n\r\nAll the collections were dispersed by sale in 1824. The books were sold\r\nby Mr. Evans of Pall Mall in three parts, commencing on the 11th of May\r\nand continuing until the 28th of June. The total amount realised was\r\neighteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-nine pounds, sixteen\r\nshillings. The prices obtained were by no means high. The Gutenberg\r\nBible, which was a very fine one, fetched less than two hundred pounds,\r\nand the copy of the Mentz Psalter, for which Mr. Quaritch subsequently\r\ngave four thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds at Sir J. H. Thorold's\r\nsale in 1884, sold for one hundred and thirty-six pounds, ten shillings.\r\nThe Latin Bible of 1462 was disposed of for the same sum; and the unique\r\nvellum Livy, which cost Sir Mark nine hundred and three pounds at the\r\nsale of Mr. Edwards's books in 1815, realised but four hundred and\r\nseventy-two pounds, ten shillings. This volume was bought by Messrs.\r\nPayne and Foss, who sold it to Mr. John Dent, and at the sale of his\r\ncollection in 1827 it was acquired for two hundred and sixty-two pounds,\r\nten shillings by the Right Hon. Thomas Grenville, who bequeathed it to\r\nthe British Museum in 1846. The three manuscripts mentioned--The Office\r\nof the Virgin Mary, the Report of Convocation on Henry VIII.'s divorce\r\nfrom Anne of Cleves, and Dugdale's Visitation of the County of\r\nYork--fetched respectively one hundred and sixty-three pounds, sixteen\r\nshillings; two hundred and fifteen pounds, five shillings; and one\r\nhundred and fifty-seven pounds, ten shillings.\r\n\r\nSir M. Masterman Sykes was one of the original members of the Roxburghe\r\nClub, and in 1818 printed for presentation to the members a portion of\r\nLydgate's Poems. He was the 'Lorenzo' of Dibdin, who describes him as\r\n'not less known than respected for the suavity of his manners, the\r\nkindness of his disposition, and the liberality of his conduct in all\r\nmatters connected with books and prints.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD HEBER, 1773-1833\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Heber, styled by Sir Walter Scott 'Heber the Magnificent, whose\r\nlibrary and cellar are so superior to all others in the world,' was the\r\neldest son of Reginald Heber, lord of the manors of Marton in Yorkshire,\r\nand Hodnet in Shropshire, and was half-brother to Reginald Heber, Bishop\r\nof Calcutta. He was born in Westminster on the 5th of January 1773, and\r\nwas first educated under the private tuition of the Rev. George Henry\r\nGlasse; afterwards proceeding to Brasenose College, Oxford, where he\r\ngraduated B.A. in 1796, and M.A. in the following year. In 1822 the\r\nUniversity conferred on him the degree of D.C.L. On the death of his\r\nfather in 1804, Heber succeeded to the estates in Yorkshire and\r\nShropshire, which he considerably augmented and improved. He was one of\r\nthe founders of the Athenaeum Club, and in 1821 he was elected a\r\nrepresentative in Parliament for the University of Oxford, but resigned\r\nhis seat in 1826. From his earliest years he was an ardent collector,\r\nand Dibdin says that he had seen a catalogue of Heber's books, compiled\r\nby him at the age of eight; and when ten years old he requested his\r\nfather to buy some volumes at a certain sale, where 'there would be the\r\nbest editions of the classics.' Of many of his books he possessed\r\nseveral copies, and on being asked by a friend why he purchased them, he\r\nseriously replied: 'Why, you see, Sir, no man can comfortably do without\r\n_three_ copies of a book. One he must have for his show copy, and he\r\nwill probably keep it at his country house. Another he will require for\r\nhis own use and reference; and unless he is inclined to part with this,\r\nwhich is very inconvenient, or risk the injury of his best copy, he must\r\nneeds have a third at the service of his friends.' Soon after the peace\r\nof 1815 Heber paid a visit to the Continent to collect books for his\r\nlibrary, and in 1825 he again left England for a considerable period for\r\nthe purpose of still further adding to his literary stores. On his\r\nreturn in 1831 he spent his time in seclusion between his country\r\nresidence at Hodnet, near Shrewsbury, and his house at Pimlico, devoting\r\nhimself to the last days of his life to the increase of his immense\r\ncollection. He died at Pimlico of an attack on the lungs, accompanied\r\nwith jaundice, on the 4th of October 1833, and was buried at Hodnet on\r\nthe 16th of the following month. The Rev. Mr. Dyce in a letter to Sir\r\nEgerton Brydges, gives a melancholy account of his end. 'Poor man,' he\r\nwrites, 'he expired at Pimlico, in the midst of his rare property,\r\n_without a friend to close his eyes_, and from all I have heard I am led\r\nto believe he died broken-hearted: he had been ailing for some time, but\r\ntook no care of himself, and seemed indeed to court death. Yet his\r\nruling passion was strong to the last. The morning he died he wrote out\r\nsome memoranda for Thorpe about books which he wished to be purchased\r\nfor him. He was the most liberal of book-collectors: I never asked him\r\nfor the loan of a volume, _which he could lay his hand on_, he did not\r\nimmediately send me.[91] Heber, who was a man of deep learning, numbered\r\namong his friends Porson, Cracherode, Canning, Southey, Dr. Burney, Sir\r\nWalter Scott, and many other distinguished persons. Sir Walter dedicated\r\nthe sixth canto of _Marmion_ to him, and alludes to his library in the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n  'Thy volumes, open as thy heart,\r\n  Delight, amusement, science, art,\r\n  To every ear and eye impart;\r\n  Yet who, of all who thus employ them,\r\n  Can like the owner's self enjoy them?--\r\n  But, hark! I hear the distant drum!\r\n  The day of Flodden Field is come.--\r\n  Adieu, dear Heber! Life and health,\r\n  And store of literary wealth.'\r\n\r\nThe number of volumes accumulated by Heber was enormous. He collected\r\nmanuscripts as well as printed books. At the time of his death he\r\npossessed eight houses overflowing with books. At Hodnet he had built a\r\nnew library which he is said to have filled with volumes selected on\r\naccount of their fine condition; and so careful was he of these, that\r\noccasionally he used to engage the whole of the inside places of the\r\ncoach for their conveyance from London. The walls of all the rooms and\r\npassages of his house at Pimlico were lined with books; and another\r\nhouse in York Street, Westminster, which he used as a depository for\r\nnewly purchased books, was literally crammed with them from the floors\r\nto the ceilings. He had a library in the High Street, Oxford; an immense\r\ncollection at Paris, which was sold in the years 1834 to 1836; another\r\nat Ghent, sold in 1835; and others at Brussels and Antwerp, together\r\nwith smaller gatherings in several places on the Continent. Dibdin\r\nestimated the total number of volumes in Heber's collections in England\r\nat one hundred and twenty-seven thousand five hundred, but other\r\ncalculations have placed it at a somewhat lower figure. The whole of the\r\nlibraries which he possessed in England and on the Continent probably\r\ncontained from one hundred and forty-five thousand to one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand volumes, as well as a very large number of pamphlets; and\r\nthey are believed to have cost him about a hundred thousand pounds. As\r\nHeber was an accomplished scholar as well as a collector, his books were\r\nchosen with ability and judgment. He was a purchaser at every great\r\nsale, and so keen was he in the prosecution of his favourite pursuit,\r\nthat on hearing of a rare book he has been known to undertake a coach\r\njourney of several hundred miles to obtain it. His library was\r\nparticularly rich in the works of the early English poets, and his\r\ncollection of Greek and Latin Classics, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and\r\nFrench books was very extensive and choice, but he had a great objection\r\nto large paper copies, because they occupied so much room on his\r\nshelves. He possessed also a number of books printed in Mexico; and\r\namong his manuscripts were to be found the letters and papers of Sir\r\nJulius Caesar, the autograph manuscript of _The Monastery_, by Sir Walter\r\nScott, and a large collection of the letters of distinguished men. For a\r\nconsiderable period his will could not be found, although diligent\r\nsearch was made for it, both at home and abroad, and his sister, Mrs.\r\nCholmondeley, was on the point of taking out letters of administration,\r\nwhen it was accidentally discovered by Dr. Dibdin among some books on an\r\nupper shelf at Pimlico. As it did not contain any directions as to the\r\ndisposal of his books, those in England, together with some brought from\r\nHolland, were sold by Sotheby and Son, Evans, and Wheatley at a series\r\nof sales extending over four years, and realised fifty-seven thousand\r\nfive hundred and fifty-four pounds, twelve shillings. The catalogue is\r\nin thirteen parts, bearing the dates 1834-37. His books on the\r\nContinent, with the drawings and coins, fetched about ten thousand\r\npounds more.\r\n\r\nHeber edited the works of Persius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, and\r\nClaudianus. He also reprinted the _Caltha Poetarum, or the Bumble Bee_,\r\nof T. Cutwode, from the edition of 1599, for the Roxburghe Club, and\r\nassisted in the preparation of the third edition of Ellis's _Specimens\r\nof the Early English Poets_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: _The Book Fancier._ By Percy Fitzgerald (London, 1887), p.\r\n230.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD GRENVILLE, FIRST DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, 1776-1839\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Temple Nugent Brydges Chandos Grenville, first Duke of\r\nBuckingham, was born in London on the 20th of March 1776. He was the\r\neldest son of George Grenville, Earl Temple, who was made Marquis of\r\nBuckingham in 1784. He began collecting books at a very early age, and\r\nin 1798 had already commenced the formation of a library at Stowe; and\r\nthe acquisition of the manuscripts and papers of Thomas Astle, Keeper of\r\nthe Records in the Tower; the Irish manuscripts from Belanagare, the\r\nseat of The O'Conor Don; the State Papers of Arthur Capel, Earl of\r\nEssex, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in the reign of Charles II., together\r\nwith some other purchases, placed his library among the finest private\r\ncollections in the kingdom.[92] On the death of his father in 1813 he\r\nsucceeded to the title, and nine years later he was created Duke of\r\nBuckingham and Chandos. In 1827, in consequence of his great expenditure\r\non his various collections, and the munificence with which he had\r\nentertained the royal family of France, he found himself in embarrassed\r\ncircumstances, and left England, remaining abroad about two years. In\r\n1834 he was compelled to sell his furniture, pictures, and articles of\r\nvirtu, but did not part with his books, which, on his death on the 17th\r\nof January 1839, passed into the possession of his only son, Richard\r\nPlantagenet Temple Nugent Brydges Chandos Grenville, who was born on\r\nFebruary the 11th, 1797. The habits of the son were not less extravagant\r\nthan those of his father, and in 1847 the effects at Stowe and his other\r\nresidences were seized by bailiffs, and in August and September 1848 the\r\npictures, furniture, china, plate, etc., were sold by auction, realising\r\nover seventy-five thousand five hundred pounds. The printed books in the\r\nlibrary were sold by Sotheby and Wilkinson, on January 8th, 1849, and\r\neleven following days, and January 29, and eleven following days. There\r\nwere six thousand two hundred and twelve lots in the two sales, which\r\nbrought ten thousand three hundred and fifty-five pounds, seven\r\nshillings and sixpence. The extensive and valuable series of engraved\r\nportraits contained in the Duke's illustrated copy of the _Biographical\r\nHistory of England_, by the Rev. James Granger, was sold by the same\r\nauctioneers on March 5th and eight following days, and a continuation of\r\nit by the Rev. Mark Noble, together with some other engravings, on the\r\n21st of March and five following days. There were two thousand two\r\nhundred and one lots in these two sales, for which the sum of three\r\nthousand seven hundred and ninety-nine pounds, eighteen shillings and\r\nsixpence was obtained. The manuscripts were bought by the Earl of\r\nAshburnham for eight thousand pounds. The collection of printed books in\r\nthe Stowe library was inferior in interest to that of the manuscripts,\r\nbut it contained some rare and choice volumes. Amongst them was a\r\nblock-book, _The Apocalypse_, which sold for ninety-four pounds;\r\n_Missale ad usum Ecclesiae Andegavensis_, on vellum, printed in 1489,\r\nsixty-three pounds; Le Fevre's _Recuyles of the Hystoryes of Troye_,\r\nprinted by Wynkyn de Worde in 1503, fifty-five pounds; a complete set of\r\nthe twenty-five parts in eight volumes of De Bry's _Collectiones\r\nPeregrinationum_, printed at Frankfurt in 1590-1634, eighty-one pounds;\r\nDe Bry's _Relation of Virginia_, translated by Hariot, printed at\r\nFrankfurt in 1590, sixty-three pounds; the first Shakespeare folio\r\n(mended, and the title-page slightly imperfect), seventy-six pounds;\r\nfine, large, and perfect copies of the second and third folios, eleven\r\npounds, five shillings and thirty-five pounds; Shakespeare's _Poems_,\r\n1640, seven pounds, ten shillings; Prynne's _Records_, three volumes,\r\n1665-70, one hundred and forty pounds; the fourth volume, printed in\r\n1665 or 1666, believed to be unique, three hundred and thirty-five\r\npounds; Houbraken's _Heads of Illustrious Persons_, two volumes, 1756,\r\nfolio, large paper, with first states and duplicate proofs of the\r\nplates, etc., ninety-one pounds; Bartolozzi's Engravings, a collection\r\nof six hundred and sixty plates in various proof states, bound in eight\r\nfolio volumes, sixty-two pounds; Boydell's Prints, five hundred and\r\nforty fine impressions, bound in nine folio volumes, seventy-eight\r\npounds, fifteen shillings; Lysons's _Topographical Account of\r\nBuckinghamshire_, inlaid in eight volumes, atlas folio, and\r\nsuper-illustrated with four hundred and eighty drawings, etc., five\r\nhundred and forty pounds; and Lysons's _Environs of London_, large\r\npaper, eighteen volumes quarto, super-illustrated with eight hundred\r\ndrawings and a large number of plates, one hundred and thirty-three\r\npounds. The Duke, who died at the Great Western Hotel, London, on July\r\nthe 29th, 1861, was the author of _Memoirs of the Court and Cabinets of\r\nGeorge III._, 1853-55, two volumes; _Memoirs of the Court of England\r\nduring the Regency_, 1856, two volumes; _Memoirs of the Court of George\r\nIV._, 1859, two volumes; _Memoirs of the Courts and Cabinets of William\r\nIV. and Victoria_, 1861, two volumes; and _Private Diary of Richard,\r\nDuke of Buckingham and Chandos_, 1862, four volumes; together with a few\r\npolitical works.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: A descriptive catalogue of the manuscripts in the Stowe\r\nlibrary by the Rev. Charles O'Conor, D.D., the Duke's librarian, was\r\nprinted in 1818-19.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY PERKINS, 1778-1855\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Perkins, who was born in 1778, was a partner in the well-known\r\nfirm of Barclay, Perkins and Co., brewers, but he does not appear to\r\nhave taken an active part in the business, and he spent the later part\r\nof his life in retirement among his books at Hanworth Park, Middlesex.\r\nHe died at Dover on the 15th of April 1855.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins, who was a Fellow of the Linnean, Geological and\r\nHorticultural Societies, possessed a small but exceedingly valuable\r\nlibrary, which, among many other extremely rare books, contained two\r\ncopies of the Gutenberg Bible, one on vellum and the other on paper; a\r\ncopy on vellum of Fust and Schoeffer's Latin Bible of 1462; a copy of\r\nthe Coverdale Bible; several works from the press of Caxton, and the\r\nfirst four editions of Shakespeare's Plays. It also comprised many fine\r\nmanuscripts, some of them superbly illuminated. Mr. Henry Perkins\r\nbequeathed his books to his son, Mr. Algernon Perkins, and after his\r\ndeath in 1870 they were sold by auction at Hanworth by Gadsden, Ellis\r\nand Co. on the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th of June 1873. There were but eight\r\nhundred and sixty-five lots in the sale, but they realised an average of\r\nthirty pounds, or a total of twenty-five thousand nine hundred and\r\nfifty-four pounds, four shillings, the largest sum ever obtained for a\r\nlibrary of the same extent. The vellum copy of the Gutenberg Bible was\r\npurchased for the Earl of Ashburnham for three thousand four hundred\r\npounds; and the paper copy, now in the Huth library, fetched two\r\nthousand six hundred and ninety. Fust and Schoeffer's Latin Bible of\r\n1462, which Mr. Perkins acquired at the sale of Mr. Dent's books for one\r\nhundred and seventy-three pounds, five shillings, sold for seven hundred\r\nand eighty pounds; while the copy of Coverdale's Bible, which wanted the\r\ntitle and two following leaves and the map, realised four hundred\r\npounds; and the 1623 edition of Shakespeare's Plays brought five hundred\r\nand eighty-five pounds. The manuscripts also went for large sums. John\r\nLydgate's _Sege of Troye_, a magnificently illuminated manuscript on\r\nvellum of the fifteenth century; _Les OEuvres Diverses_ of Jehan de\r\nMeun; and _Les Cent Histoires de Troye_ of Christine de Pisan, of about\r\nthe same period, sold respectively for thirteen hundred and twenty, six\r\nhundred and ninety, and six hundred and fifty pounds. The prices\r\nobtained for the books were generally greatly in excess of those given\r\nby Mr. Perkins for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK PERKINS, 1780-1860\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick Perkins of Chepstead, Kent, born in 1780, was a brother of\r\nHenry Perkins, and a partner in the same firm. He also formed a good\r\nlibrary, which contained the first four Shakespeare folios, and a\r\nconsiderable number of the separate plays in quarto. Among them were the\r\nfirst editions of _Love's Labour Lost_, _Much Ado about Nothing_, the\r\nSecond Part of _Henry the Fourth_, _Troilus and Cressida_, _Pericles_,\r\n_Othello_, and the second or first complete edition of _Romeo and\r\nJuliet_, as well as the first edition of _Lucrece_. Three Caxtons were\r\nto be found in the collection: the _Mirrour of the World_, the\r\n_Chastising of Goddes Children_, and Higden's _Polycronicon_, but they\r\nwere not good copies. The library also comprised some fine illuminated\r\nHorae and other manuscripts, including a copy on vellum of Chaucer's\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ of the fifteenth century. Mr. Perkins died on the\r\n10th of October 1860, and his library was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson and\r\nHodge on July 10th, 1889, and six following days. There were two\r\nthousand and eighty-six lots in the sale, which realised eight thousand\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-two pounds, seven shillings. The first\r\nShakespeare folio fetched four hundred and fifteen pounds, the second\r\nforty-seven pounds, the third one hundred pounds, and the fourth\r\nfourteen pounds. Of the quarto plays, the Second Part of _Henry the\r\nFourth_ sold for two hundred and twenty-five pounds, _Othello_ for one\r\nhundred and thirty pounds, and _Romeo and Juliet_ for one hundred and\r\nsixty-four pounds. The copies of _Love's Labour Lost_, _Much Ado about\r\nNothing_, _Troilus and Cressida_, and _Pericles_ were poor ones, and\r\nrealised but comparatively small sums. The _Lucrece_ fetched two hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN BELLINGHAM INGLIS, 1780-1870\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Bellingham Inglis was born in London on the 14th of February 1780.\r\nHis father, a partner in the firm of Inglis, Ellice and Co., merchants,\r\nMark Lane, London, was a Director of the East India Company, and was at\r\none time its Chairman. In consequence of the failure of his father young\r\nInglis set up in business on his own account in the wine trade, but this\r\nnot proving successful, he retired after a short time on the money\r\nrescued from the wreck of the fortune of his father, who died soon after\r\nhis failure. He resided for many years in St. John's Wood, but\r\nafterwards removed to Hampstead Heath. He died at 13 Albion Road, N.W.,\r\non the 9th of December 1870.\r\n\r\nMr. Inglis, who was a good classical scholar, an excellent linguist, and\r\na man of considerable literary ability, commenced collecting books at a\r\nvery early age, and soon formed a very valuable and important library,\r\nwhich was especially rich in works from the presses of the early\r\nEnglish printers. Unlike some possessors of libraries, he read the\r\nbooks which he had collected; and the Duke of Sussex, at one of his\r\nliterary dinners at Kensington Palace, is reported to have said:\r\n'Gentlemen, you are all very learned about titles, editions, and\r\nprinters, but none of you seem to have read anything of the books except\r\nMr. Inglis here.' In 1832 he translated into English, for the first\r\ntime, the _Philobiblon_ of Richard de Bury, and presented it to Thomas\r\nRodd, the bookseller, who published it. He also made translations of\r\nseveral other mediaeval printed books and manuscripts, which have never\r\nbeen published. A biographical notice of him appears in _The Bookworm_\r\nof December 1870, by J.P. Berjeau, the editor of that periodical. A\r\nportion of Inglis's books was sold anonymously by Sotheby on June 9th,\r\n1826, and seven following days. The title-page of the catalogue reads:\r\n'Catalogue of a singularly curious and valuable selection from the\r\nLibrary of a Gentleman, including three extraordinary specimens of Block\r\nPrinting; Books printed in the Fifteenth Century; Books printed on\r\nvellum; Fine copies of Works from the Presses of Caxton, Machlinia,\r\nWynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Julyan Notary, Verard, etc.; an extensive\r\nCollection of Old English Poetry; Romances; Historical and Theological\r\nTracts; early Voyages and Travels; curious Treatises on Witches and\r\nWitchcraft; some of the earliest Dictionaries and Vocabularies in the\r\nEnglish Language, etc. Likewise several Manuscripts on vellum, most\r\nbeautifully illuminated, etc.' The number of lots in this sale was\r\nsixteen hundred and sixty-five, and the sum realised three thousand\r\nthree hundred and thirty-three pounds, nine shillings and sixpence. The\r\nprices obtained for the books were extremely low. The three\r\nblock-books:--the first edition of the _Speculum Humanae Salvationis_,\r\n_Historia Sancti Johannis Evangelistae ejusque Visiones Apocalypticae_,\r\nand the _Biblia Pauperum_ fetched but ninety-five pounds, eleven\r\nshillings; forty-seven pounds, five shillings, and thirty-six pounds,\r\nfifteen shillings respectively; while no more than four hundred and\r\nthirty-one pounds, fifteen shillings and sixpence could be obtained for\r\nthe thirteen Caxtons in the sale--about thirty-three pounds each. The\r\nfollowing are a few of the other notable books in this fine collection,\r\nand the prices they fetched: _Les Faits de Maistre Alain Chartier,\r\nimprimez a Paris par Pierre le Caron pour Anthoine Verard_, printed on\r\nvellum, with capital letters painted in gold and colours, fifty-six\r\npounds, fourteen shillings; _Le Recueil des Histoires Troiennes, imprime\r\na Paris par Anthoine Verard_, presentation copy to Charles VIII.,\r\nprinted on vellum, ornamented with eighty-three miniatures, twenty-seven\r\npounds; Vincent, _Les cinq volumes du Miroir Hystorial_, _imprime a\r\nParis par Anthoine Verard_, 1495-96, forty-six pounds, four shillings;\r\n_Speculum Christiani_, printed by Machlinia, sixteen pounds, sixteen\r\nshillings; _Promptorius Puerorum_, printed by Pynson in 1499,\r\nthirty-eight pounds, seventeen shillings; _The Floure of the\r\nCommandments of God_, Wynkyn de Worde, 1521, thirteen pounds, thirteen\r\nshillings; _The Catechisme, set furth by ... Johne, Archbischop of Sanct\r\nAndrous, etc. Prentit at Sanct Androus_, 1552, sixteen pounds, five\r\nshillings and sixpence; _Mary of Nemmegen_, printed at Antwerp by Jan\r\nVan Doesborgh in 1518 or 1519, the only copy known, twenty-four pounds;\r\nPainter, _The Palace of Pleasure_, London, Thomas Marshe, 1575, a very\r\nfine copy, twenty-three pounds; and Shakespeare's _Sonnets_, London,\r\n1609, forty pounds, nineteen shillings. Perhaps the finest of the\r\nmanuscripts were a beautifully illuminated copy on vellum of the _Liber\r\nde Proprietatibus Rerum, Anglice_, by Bartholomaeus de Glanvilla, written\r\ntowards the end of the fourteenth century, which fetched fifty-one\r\npounds, nine shillings; and Boccaccio's _Tragedies of the Falle of\r\nUnfortunate Princes_, translated into English verse, written on vellum\r\nin England in the early part of the fifteenth century, and richly\r\nilluminated. Thirty pounds, nine shillings was all that was obtained for\r\nthis fine manuscript. After Inglis's death, his son, Dr. C. Inglis, sold\r\nsuch books as he could not find room for. They were disposed of by\r\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge on the 31st of July 1871, and five\r\nfollowing days, and realised two thousand seven hundred and sixty-six\r\npounds, thirteen shillings and sixpence. Among the fifteen hundred and\r\neighty-eight lots in the sale were a few rare books and some fine\r\npapyri. A third sale of the books in this splendid library, by order of\r\nDr. C. Inglis, took place on June 11th, 1900, and three following days,\r\nby the same auctioneers. In this sale there were eight hundred and\r\nforty-nine lots, for which the sum of seven thousand five hundred and\r\nnineteen pounds, twelve shillings and sixpence was obtained. Although no\r\nCaxtons were to be found among the books, there were many rare and\r\ninteresting examples from the presses of Machlinia, Pynson, Wynkyn de\r\nWorde, Julian Notary and other early English printers. The foreign\r\nprinters were also well represented, and the collection contained\r\nseveral beautiful Books of Hours, both printed and in manuscript. Some\r\nvery high prices were obtained for the more important books, as the\r\nfollowing list of a few of the most notable will show:--_Speculum Humanae\r\nSalvationis_, printed by G. Zainer at Augsburg in 1471, eighty-four\r\npounds; Turrecremata, _Meditationes_, Romae, 1473, one hundred pounds;\r\nthe first edition of the _Philobiblon_ of Richard de Bury, Coloniae,\r\n1473, eighty pounds; _Rolle de Hampole super Job_, attributed to the\r\nOxford press of Rood and Hunt, about 1481-86, three hundred pounds;\r\n_Chronicle of England_, printed by Machlinia about 1484, one hundred and\r\nseventy-five pounds; _Heures de lusaige de Romme_, with cuts printed in\r\nvarious colours, Paris, Jehan du Pre, 1490, two hundred and seventy-two\r\npounds; First Letter of Columbus (Latin) 1493, Vespuccius, _Mundus\r\nNovus_, 1502, and other rare tracts in one volume, two hundred and\r\nthirty pounds; _Verardus in Laudem Fernandi Hispaniarum Regis_, etc.,\r\ncontaining the letter of Columbus to King Ferdinand on his discovery of\r\nAmerica, 1494, ninety pounds; _Vitas Patrum_, printed by Wynkyn de Worde\r\nin 1495, fifty pounds; _Hoefken van Devotien_, Antwerpen, 1496, one\r\nhundred and one pounds; _Postilla Epistolarum et Evangeliorum\r\nDominicalium_, printed by Julian Notary in 1509, fifty pounds; _Mirrour\r\nof Oure Ladye_, R. Fawkes, 1530, forty-nine pounds; _Heures de Rome_,\r\nwith illustrations by Geoffroy Tory, Paris, 1525, one hundred and\r\nforty-four pounds; and Spenser's _Faerie Queene_, _Foure Hymnes_,\r\n_Prothalamion_, etc., all first editions, 1590-96, one hundred and\r\nseventy pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY MILLER, 1789-1848\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. William Henry Miller, who was born in 1789, was the only child of\r\nMr. William Miller of Craigentinny, Midlothian. In 1830 he entered\r\nParliament as one of the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme, which seat he\r\nheld until the year 1841. He died unmarried at his residence,\r\nCraigentinny House, near Edinburgh, on the 31st of October 1848, and was\r\nburied, according to his desire, in a mausoleum on his estate. Mr.\r\nMiller formed a fine collection of very choice books at Britwell Court,\r\nBuckinghamshire, many of which he acquired at the Heber and other\r\nimportant sales of the first half of the nineteenth century. He was very\r\nparticular about the condition and size of the volumes he purchased, and\r\nfrom his habit of carrying a foot-rule about him for the purpose of\r\nascertaining their dimensions he became known as 'Measure Miller.' The\r\nlibrary was bequeathed to his cousin Miss Marsh, from whom it passed to\r\nMr. Samuel Christie-Miller, who was Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme from\r\n1847 to 1859, and on his death on the 5th of April 1889 to Mr. Wakefield\r\nChristie-Miller, who died at Dublin on the 22nd of February 1898. Many\r\nrare books have been added to the Britwell Library by its later\r\npossessors. The additions made by the last owner were especially\r\nimportant, notably that of the larger portion of the Elizabethan\r\nrarities discovered in 1867 at Lamport Hall, the seat of Sir Charles\r\nIsham; and the collection may now be considered unrivalled among private\r\nlibraries for the number of choice examples of English and Scottish\r\nliterature which it contains, particularly in the division of English\r\npoetry. The finest copy known of the _Dictes or Sayings of the\r\nPhilosophers_, one of the three extant copies of the _Morale Prouerbes\r\nof Cristyne_, and nine other works printed by Caxton, are to be found on\r\nthe shelves of the library, as well as a large number of books from the\r\npresses of Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Julyan Notary, and other early\r\nEnglish printers. Among them are many editions of the grammatical\r\ntreatises of Robert Whitinton and John Stanbridge, printed by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde, and unique copies of Fitzherbert's _Boke of Husbandrie_, the\r\nromance of _Oliver of Castile_, and _Fysshynge with an Angle_, all by\r\nthe same printer. The library contains also a fine series of the early\r\neditions of the English Chronicles, and of the works of Chaucer. Among\r\nthe treasures of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods are the first\r\nShakespeare folio (the second, third, and fourth folios are also in the\r\nlibrary); an unique copy of an edition of _Venus and Adonis_, printed\r\nfor William Leake at London in 1599, from the Isham collection; all the\r\nearly editions of Sidney's _Arcadia_; fine examples of the early\r\neditions of the works of Edmund Spenser; the only perfect copy known of\r\nthe first edition of the _Paradyse of Daintie Devises_; and remarkably\r\ncomplete sets of the works of Churchyard, Breton, Greene, Dekker, Wither\r\nand Brathwaite. Other notable books in this splendid library are a copy\r\non vellum, with coloured maps, of Ptolemy's _Cosmographia_, printed at\r\nUlm in 1482, and bound by Derome; the Aldine edition of _Poliphili\r\nHypnerotomachia_, in the original binding, and an unique copy of the\r\nEnglish translation printed in London by Samuel Waterson in 1592; a fine\r\nand perfect set in nine parts of the _Mirrour of Princely Deedes and\r\nKnighthood_ (a translation of the Spanish _Espejo de Principes y\r\nCavalleros_); editions of Hakluyt's _Voyages_; a beautiful and tall copy\r\nof _Purchas his Pilgrimes_; the finest and most complete set which has\r\nbeen formed of De Bry's _Voyages_; the first issue of Milton's _Paradise\r\nLost_; the first edition of Walton's _Compleat Angler_ in the original\r\nsheepskin binding; the Kilmarnock edition of Burns's _Poems_; and\r\nseveral of the original editions of Shelley's works, including the\r\nexcessively rare _OEdipus Tyrannus_. There is a fine collection of\r\nearly English music in the Britwell Library, and it possesses the\r\ngreater portion of the Heber ballads and broadsides, and a large number\r\nof books which once belonged to De Thou. Many of the volumes are\r\nmasterpieces of the work of Bedford, Riviere, Lortic, and other English\r\nand foreign binders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE DANIEL, 1789-1864\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Daniel was born in London on the 16th of September 1789. After\r\nreceiving an education at Mr. Thomas Hogg's boarding-school at\r\nPaddington Green, he became a clerk to a stockbroker in Tokenhouse\r\nYard,[93] and afterwards followed the profession of an accountant; but\r\nhe employed all his leisure time in literary pursuits, and in the\r\ncollection of books, works of art and curiosities. He commenced writing\r\nat a very early age, and was the author of a novel _The Adventures of\r\nDick Distich_, and a considerable number of poetical and dramatic\r\npieces. He also contributed many articles to _Ackerman's Poetical\r\nMagazine_, _Bentley's Miscellany_, and other magazines, and was the\r\neditor of Cumberland's _British Theatre_, and Cumberland's _Minor\r\nTheatre_. His first printed production, _Stanzas on Lord Nelsons Victory\r\nand Death_, written in conjunction with a young friend, appeared in\r\n1805, but he tells us that he wrote some verses when he was but eight\r\nyears of age on the death of his father. In 1811 he published a poem\r\ncalled _The Times, or the Prophecy_, and in 1812 a poetical squib\r\nfounded on the reputed horse-whipping of the Prince of Wales by Lord\r\nYarmouth, entitled _R-y-l Stripes; or, a Kick from Yar--th to Wa--s_,\r\nfor the suppression of which a large sum was paid by the Prince Regent.\r\nIn the same year appeared _The Adventures of Dick Distich_ in three\r\nvolumes, which was written by the author before he was eighteen, and a\r\nvolume of _Miscellaneous Poems_; and in 1814 _The Modern Dunciad_, in\r\nwhich he sings the praises of 'old books, old wines, old customs, and\r\nold friends.' He continued to write during the whole of his life, and\r\nhis last work, _Love's Last Labour not Lost_, was published in 1863.\r\nDaniel was fond of convivial society, and numbered Charles Lamb and\r\nRobert Bloomfield among his acquaintances, and he was also intimate with\r\nmany of the principal actors of the day. He died at his son's house, The\r\nGrove, Stoke Newington, on the 30th of March 1864. The cause of his\r\ndeath was apoplexy.\r\n\r\nDaniel formed a very choice and valuable library in his residence, 18\r\nCanonbury Square, Islington, which was chiefly remarkable for rare\r\neditions of old English writers, and very fine collections of\r\nElizabethan black-letter ballads and Shakespeariana. The Elizabethan\r\nballads would alone be sufficient to render any library famous. They\r\nwere one hundred and forty-nine in number, and he is said to have\r\npurchased them for fifty pounds from Mr. William Stevenson Fitch,\r\nPostmaster at Ipswich, who is believed to have obtained them from the\r\nhousekeeper at Helmingham Hall, Suffolk, the residence of the Tollemache\r\nfamily. Of these ballads seventy-nine were sold to Mr. Heber by Mr.\r\nDaniel for seventy pounds, and the remaining seventy were bought at the\r\nsale of his library for seven hundred and fifty pounds by Mr. Huth, who\r\nhad them printed for presentation to the members of the Philobiblon\r\nSociety. The Shakespearian collection comprised splendid copies of the\r\nfirst four folios and eighteen of the quarto plays, together with the\r\n1594 and 1655 editions of _Lucrece_, the 1594 and 1596 editions of\r\n_Venus and Adonis_, and the first editions of the _Sonnets_ and _Poems_.\r\nThe library also contained a large number of early Jest-Books,\r\nDrolleries, Garlands and Penny-Histories; and among the rare editions of\r\nEnglish writers were works by John Skelton, Edmund Spenser, Anthony\r\nChute, Robert Chester, Anthony Munday, Ben Jonson, Patrick Hannay,\r\nGeorge Herbert, Robert Herrick, John Milton, and many others. Several\r\nvery beautiful manuscripts were also to be found in it.\r\n\r\nDaniel's library was sold by auction by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge on\r\nthe 20th of July 1864, and the nine following days. There were eighteen\r\nhundred and seventeen lots, which realised thirteen thousand nine\r\nhundred and eighty-four pounds, eleven shillings; the water-colour\r\ndrawings, engravings, portraits, coins, etc., of which there were four\r\nhundred and sixty-one lots, were sold at the same time, and produced one\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty pounds, eleven shillings more.\r\n\r\nThe sale excited great interest, and many of the books went for large\r\nsums; but the prices obtained for others were small compared with those\r\nthe volumes would fetch at the present time: a fine copy of the first\r\nedition of Walton's _Compleat Angler_ realised no more than twenty-seven\r\npounds, ten shillings. All the Shakespeares sold well. The first folio,\r\nprobably the finest example extant, was bought by the Baroness\r\nBurdett-Coutts for six hundred and eighty-two guineas, till recently the\r\nhighest price ever obtained for a copy;[94] and the second, third and\r\nfourth folios fetched respectively one hundred and forty-eight pounds,\r\nforty-six pounds, and twenty-one pounds, ten shillings. The third folio\r\nwas a good copy, but had the title in facsimile, which accounts for the\r\nsmall sum it realised. Of the quarto plays, the first edition of _King\r\nRichard the Third_--a very fine copy--sold for three hundred and\r\nfifty-one pounds, fifteen shillings; the first editions of the _Merry\r\nWives of Windsor_ and _Love's Labour Lost_ for three hundred and\r\nforty-six pounds, ten shillings each, and the first edition of _King\r\nRichard the Second_ for three hundred and forty-one pounds, five\r\nshillings. The 1594 and 1596 editions of _Venus and Adonis_ realised two\r\nhundred and forty pounds and three hundred and fifteen pounds; a copy of\r\nthe _Sonnets_ two hundred and twenty-five pounds, fifteen shillings; and\r\nthe first edition of _Lucrece_ one hundred and fifty-seven pounds, ten\r\nshillings. The copy of _Love's Labour Lost_, and the 1596 edition of\r\n_Venus and Adonis_, of which the Bodleian Library possesses the only\r\nother copy, were secured for the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the other more notable books in the library,\r\ntogether with the prices they fetched at the sale:--Unique copy of _The\r\nBoke of Hawkynge and Huntynge and Fysshynge_, printed by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde, without date, one hundred and eight pounds; _Rychard Cuer de\r\nLyon_, also printed by Wynkyn de Worde, 1528, ninety-two pounds;\r\n_Complaynt of a Dolorous Lover_, printed by Robert Wyer about 1550,\r\nunique, sixty-seven pounds, four shillings; _The Tragicall Historie of\r\nRomeus and Juliet_ (London, 1562), seventy-seven pounds, fourteen\r\nshillings; _Merry Jeste of a shrewde and curste Wyfe_ (London, about\r\n1575), unique, sixty-four pounds; Munday's _Banquet of Daintie\r\nConceits_ (London, 1588), unique, two hundred and twenty-five pounds;\r\nChute's _Beawtie Dishonoured_, written under the title of _Shores Wife_\r\n(London, 1593), unique, ninety-six pounds; _Maroccus Extaticus, or\r\nBankes Bay Horse_ (London, 1595), eighty-one pounds; Chester's _Loves\r\nMartyr, or Rosalins Complaynt_ (London, 1601)--this work contains a poem\r\n(Threnos) by Shakespeare at p. 172--one hundred and thirty-eight pounds;\r\n_Meeting of Gallants at an Ordinarie, or the Walkes in Powles_ (London,\r\n1604), unique, eighty-one pounds; _Sejanus, his Fall_, by Ben Jonson,\r\nfirst edition (London, 1605), printed on large paper, a presentation\r\ncopy from the author with the following autograph inscription--\r\n\r\n      'To my perfect friend Mr. Francis Crane\r\n        I erect this Altar of Friendship,\r\n  and leave it as an eternall witnesse of my Love.\r\n\r\n  BEN JONSON'--\r\n\r\nunique, one hundred and six pounds; Hannay's _Philomela, the\r\nNightingale_, etc. (London, 1622), ninety-six pounds.\r\n\r\nA carved casket made out of the mulberry tree in Shakespeare's Garden,\r\nand presented to Garrick with the freedom of the borough of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, was purchased at Charles Mathews's sale in 1835 by\r\nDaniel for forty-seven guineas, and presented by him to the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Dictionary of National Biography._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: At a sale at Sotheby's on July 11th, 1899, Mr. M'George of\r\nGlasgow gave seventeen hundred pounds for a copy; and two years later\r\nMr. Quaritch purchased another copy at Christie's for seventeen hundred\r\nand twenty pounds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, SIXTH DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE, 1790-1858\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the Dukes of Devonshire were men of letters and collectors of books.\r\nWilliam, the first Duke, acquired many volumes which had belonged to De\r\nThou, and William, the third Duke, bought largely at the sales of the\r\nlibraries of Colbert, Baluze, Count von Hoym and other collectors of his\r\ntime; but William, the sixth Duke, who was born on May the 21st, 1790,\r\nmay justly be regarded as the founder of the Chatsworth Library in its\r\npresent form. 'He imbibed a taste for literature and books,' says Sir\r\nJ.P. Lacaita in his preface to the catalogue of the Library, 'from his\r\nmother, Lady Georgiana Spencer, the \"beautiful Duchess of Devonshire,\"\r\nand from his uncle George John, second Earl Spencer, who formed what is\r\nperhaps the finest private library in existence.' In 1811 he succeeded\r\nto the Dukedom, and shortly afterwards endeavoured to add to his library\r\nCount M'Carthy's collection, for which he offered twenty thousand\r\npounds, but the offer was declined. He purchased the choicer portion of\r\nthe books of Thomas Dampier, Bishop of Ely, and he bought largely at the\r\nsales of the Edwards, Roxburghe, Towneley and other libraries. In 1815\r\nthe Duke removed the books from his other residences to Chatsworth\r\nwith a view to the formation of a great library there,[95] and in 1821\r\nhe purchased John Philip Kemble's splendid collection of plays for two\r\nthousand pounds, adding to it four years later the first edition of\r\n_Hamlet_, which he purchased of Messrs. Payne and Foss, the booksellers\r\nof Pall Mall, for one hundred pounds. But one other copy of this\r\nprecious little volume is known to exist, that in the British Museum,\r\nwhich wants the title-page, while that acquired by the Duke is without\r\nthe last leaf. After the death of the Duke on January the 18th, 1858,\r\nthe collection at Chatsworth was further enlarged by his successor, who\r\ntransferred to it some choice books from the library at Chiswick, and\r\nalso added to it a select portion of the books of his brother, Lord\r\nRichard Cavendish, who died in 1873.[96] In 1879 a catalogue of the\r\nbooks at Chatsworth was compiled by Sir J.P. Lacaita, the librarian, in\r\nfour volumes, and printed at the Chiswick Press. The library is rich in\r\nchoice and early editions of the Greek and Latin Classics, and the\r\nproductions of the Aldine Press are particularly numerous and fine. Of\r\nthe Bibles, the Latin Bible of 1462, and a vellum copy of that printed\r\nby Jenson in 1476, are perhaps the most important. As many as\r\ntwenty-five works from the press of Caxton, and twenty-four from that\r\nof Wynkyn de Worde are to be found in the catalogue. Among the Caxtons\r\nis a copy of the _Recuyell of the Histories of Troye_, which once\r\nbelonged to Elizabeth Grey, wife of Edward IV. This volume was bought at\r\nthe Roxburghe sale for one thousand and sixty pounds, ten shillings. A\r\nmagnificent copy of De Bry's _Collectiones Peregrinationum_, which\r\nformerly belonged to Francois Cesar Le Tellier, Marquis de Courtanvaux,\r\nis also deserving of special notice. A large proportion of the books are\r\nin handsome and historical bindings, and no fewer than twenty-four\r\nvolumes from the library of Grolier are to be found on the shelves of\r\nthe collection, which also contains a nearly complete set of County\r\nHistories. Among the manuscripts is one of great interest. It is a\r\nMissal given by King Henry VII. to his daughter Margaret, Queen Consort\r\nof James IV., King of Scotland, and mother of the Lady Margaret Douglas,\r\nwho later presented the volume to the Archbishop of St. Andrews. The\r\nbook contains two notes in the handwriting of Henry. On the recto of the\r\nfourteenth leaf he has written, 'Remember yor kynde and louyng fader an\r\nyor good prayers, Henry Ky'; and on the reverse of leaf 32, 'Pray for\r\nyour louyng fader that gave you this booke, and I geve you att all tymes\r\ngodds bless[~y]g and myne, Henry Ky.' On the reverse of leaf 156 Lady\r\nMargaret Douglas has written, 'My good lorde of Saynt Andrews i pray\r\nyou pray for me that gaufe yow thys buuk--yowrs too my pour, Margaret.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe Devonshire library also contains a magnificent series of drawings by\r\nthe old masters, and prints by the early engravers, which were acquired\r\nby William, the second Duke. The gem of the collection of drawings is\r\nthe _Liber Veritatis_, a set of original designs by Claude Lorrain,\r\nwhich Louis XIV. endeavoured in vain to purchase.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Preface to the catalogue of the library at Chatsworth, by\r\nSir J.P. Lacaita.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR THOMAS PHILLIPPS, BART., 1792-1872\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Phillipps, Bart., who was the son of Thomas Phillipps, of\r\nBroadway, Worcestershire, was born at Manchester on the 2nd of July\r\n1792. He was educated at Rugby, and in 1811 proceeded to University\r\nCollege, Oxford, graduating B.A. in 1815 and M.A. in 1820. In 1818, on\r\nthe death of his father, he succeeded to the family estates, and in 1821\r\nhe was created a baronet. Phillipps died at Thirlestaine House,\r\nCheltenham, on the 6th of February 1872, and was buried at Broadway. He\r\nwas twice married, and by his first wife had three daughters. Phillipps,\r\nwho was a Trustee of the British Museum and a Fellow of the Royal\r\nSociety and of the Society of Antiquaries, and also a member of the\r\nprincipal learned societies, both English and foreign, began at a very\r\nearly age to collect books. While at Rugby he formed a small library,\r\nthe catalogue of which is still in existence, and the inheritance of his\r\nfather's property in 1818 enabled him to commence the formation of his\r\nmagnificent collection of manuscripts. With a view to their acquisition,\r\nin 1820 he paid a visit to the Continent, and remained abroad until\r\n1825, during which time he made large purchases of manuscripts,\r\nespecially at the sale of the famous Meerman collection at the Hague in\r\n1824, and he also privately bought the manuscripts belonging to the\r\nextensive and important collection of Professor Van Ess of Darmstadt,\r\ntogether with a number of his early printed books. Phillipps was\r\nindefatigable in the acquirement of his treasures, and at the time of\r\nhis death his library contained some sixty thousand manuscripts, and a\r\ngoodly collection of printed books. He writes: 'In amassing my\r\ncollection of manuscripts, I commenced with purchasing everything that\r\nlay within my reach, to which I was instigated by reading various\r\naccounts of the destruction of valuable manuscripts.... My principal\r\nsearch has been for historical, and particularly unpublished\r\nmanuscripts, whether good or bad, and particularly those on vellum. My\r\nchief desire for preserving vellum manuscripts arose from witnessing the\r\nunceasing destruction of them by goldbeaters; my search for charters or\r\ndeeds by their destruction in the shops of glue-makers and tailors. As I\r\nadvanced the ardour of the pursuit increased, until at last I became a\r\nperfect vello-maniac (if I may coin a word), and I gave any price that\r\nwas asked. Nor do I regret it, for my object was not only to secure good\r\nmanuscripts for myself, but also to raise the public estimation of them,\r\nso that their value might be more generally known, and consequently more\r\nmanuscripts preserved. For nothing tends to the preservation of anything\r\nso much as making it bear a high price. The examples I always kept in\r\nview were Sir Robert Cotton and Sir Robert Harley.'\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Phillipps's collection was not confined to European\r\nmanuscripts. It contained several hundred Oriental ones, and he also\r\nacquired those relating to Mexico belonging to Lord Kingsborough. The\r\nilluminated manuscripts were particularly fine, and some of them had\r\nbeen executed for regal and other distinguished persons, and were\r\nbeautifully bound. Many of the manuscripts which related to Ireland and\r\nWales were of special interest and great value. For many years Phillipps\r\nkept his library, together with his fine collections of pictures,\r\ndrawings, and coins at his residence at Middle Hill, Worcestershire; but\r\nin 1862, in consequence of their ever-increasing size, he removed them\r\nto Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, which he purchased from Lord\r\nNorthwick. On Sir Thomas's death his entailed Middle Hill estates went\r\nto his eldest daughter, Henrietta Elizabeth Molyneux, the wife of James\r\nOrchard Halliwell, the Shakespearian commentator, but in a will made\r\nshortly before his death he left Thirlestaine House, together with his\r\nbooks, manuscripts, pictures, and other collections, to his third\r\ndaughter, Katherine Somerset Wyttenbach, wife of the Rev. J.E.A.\r\nFenwick, at one time vicar of Needwood, Staffordshire. This bequest was,\r\nhowever, encumbered with the singular condition, that neither his eldest\r\ndaughter, nor her husband, nor any Roman Catholic should ever enter the\r\nhouse.[97] His second daughter, Maria Sophia, who married the Rev. John\r\nWalcott of Bitterley Court, Shropshire, predeceased her father. Since\r\nthe manuscripts came into the possession of Mrs. Fenwick, portions have\r\nbeen sold by private arrangement to several of the foreign governments;\r\namongst these, however, were no English ones. A large number of the\r\nremainder have been disposed of by auction at a series of sales by\r\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, but the immense collection is by no means\r\nexhausted. The first sale took place on August 3rd, 1886, and seven\r\nfollowing days; and the others on January 22nd, 1889, and two following\r\ndays; July 15th, 1891, and following day; December 7th, 1891, and\r\nfollowing day; July 4th, 1892, and two following days; June 19th, 1893,\r\nand three following days; March 21st, 1895, and four following days;\r\nJune 10th, 1896, and six following days; May 17th, 1897, and three\r\nfollowing days; June 6th, 1898, and five following days; and June 5th,\r\n1899, and five following days. The total amount realised at all these\r\nauction sales is upwards of thirty-six thousand six hundred pounds. The\r\nprinted books in Phillipps's library, which 'included a complete set of\r\nthe publications privately printed by him at Middle Hill; important\r\nheraldic and genealogical works, county histories and topography, Welsh\r\nbooks, valuable dictionaries and grammars, and a large collection of\r\nrare articles relating to America; history, voyages and travels,' were\r\nsold in three parts by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge on August 3rd, 1886,\r\nand seven following days; January 22nd, 1889, and two following days;\r\nand December 7th, 1891, and following day. There were five thousand four\r\nhundred and sixty-two lots in the three sales, which realised three\r\nthousand two hundred and fourteen pounds, thirteen shillings and\r\nthreepence.\r\n\r\nAbout 1822 Sir Thomas Phillipps set up a private printing-press in\r\nBroadway Tower, situated on his Middle Hill estate, where he printed a\r\nlarge number of his manuscripts. Among the more important of these\r\nwere:--_Institutiones Clericorum in Comitatu Wiltoniae_, 1297-1810, two\r\nvolumes, 1821-25, folio; _Monumental Inscriptions in the County of\r\nWilton_, two volumes, 1822, folio (only six copies of this work were\r\nprinted, one of which realised fourteen pounds, ten shillings at the\r\nsale of the books); _A Book of Glamorganshire Antiquities, by Rice\r\nMerrick, Esq., 1578, now first published by Sir T. Phillipps, Bart.,\r\n1825_, folio; and _Collectanea de Familiis Diversis quibus nomen est\r\nPhillipps, etc._, two volumes, 1816-40, folio (a copy of which fetched\r\nsixteen pounds at the sale). Phillipps also printed catalogues of his\r\nmanuscripts and printed books. A fair but not complete list of the works\r\nwill be found in Lowndes's _Bibliographer's Manual of English\r\nLiterature_. In 1862 the printing-press was removed with the library and\r\nother collections to Thirlestaine House.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: _Athenaeum_, February 17, 1872.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREV. THOMAS CORSER, 1793-1876\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Thomas Corser was the third son of George Corser, banker, of\r\nWhitchurch, Shropshire. He was born at Whitchurch in 1793, and received\r\nhis early education first at the school of his native place, and\r\nafterwards at the Manchester Grammar School, from whence he was\r\nadmitted a commoner of Balliol College, Oxford. He took the degree of\r\nB.A. in 1815 and that of M.A. in 1818. In 1816 Corser was ordained to\r\nthe curacy of Condover, near Shrewsbury, and after filling several other\r\ncuracies he was appointed in 1826 to the rectory of All Saints' Church,\r\nStand, Manchester, which living he held, together with the vicarage of\r\nNorton-by-Daventry in Northamptonshire, for nearly half a century. He\r\ndied, after a long illness, at Stand Rectory on the 24th of August 1876.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. T. Corser was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in\r\n1850, and he was one of the founders of the Chetham Society, for which\r\nhe edited four works: _Chester's Triumph_, James's _Iter Lancastrense_,\r\nRobinson's _Golden Mirrour_, and _Collectanea Anglo-Poetica_. The\r\nlast-named work, of which a portion was written by Corser and the\r\nremainder by James Crossley, is an elaborate account of Corser's\r\nsplendid collection of early English poetry.\r\n\r\nCorser was one of the most learned and enthusiastic book-collectors of\r\nhis day, and his noble library contained, besides a wonderful collection\r\nof unique and rare editions of the works of the early English poets and\r\ndramatists, a fine block-book, 'Apocalypsis Sancti Johannis,' seven\r\nCaxtons, and a large number of books printed by Machlinia, Wynkyn de\r\nWorde, Pynson, Notary, Redman, and other early English printers. The\r\nlibrary also comprised a large number of books of emblems, drolleries,\r\njest-books, garlands, and many other scarce and curious works in all\r\nclasses of literature. Mr. Corser also possessed a few choice\r\nmanuscripts.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Mr. Corser, in consequence of ill health and failure of his\r\neyesight, which precluded him from the further enjoyment of his books,\r\ndetermined to part with his library, and it was sold in eight parts by\r\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. The first portion was sold on the 28th of\r\nJuly 1868, and two following days; and the last portion on June the\r\n25th, 1873, and three following days. There were six thousand two\r\nhundred and forty-four lots in the eight sales, and the total amount\r\nrealised was nineteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-one pounds.\r\nCatalogues, with the prices, of all the sales are preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum. The sums obtained for the books were not large. The\r\nblock-book sold for four hundred and forty-five pounds, and the seven\r\nCaxtons--the first edition of the _Dictes or Sayings_, _Tully of Old\r\nAge_, _Knight of the Tower_, _Golden Legend_, _Life of Our Lady_,\r\n_Speculum Vitae Christi_, and _Fayts of Arms_--realised but thirteen\r\nhundred and forty-three pounds; the _Knight of the Tower_ and _Fayts of\r\nArms_ fetching the highest prices--five hundred and sixty pounds, and\r\ntwo hundred and fifty pounds. Several of the Caxtons were, however,\r\nimperfect. _The Dyalogue of Dives and Pauper_, 1493, until recently\r\nbelieved to be the first dated book printed by Pynson, brought one\r\nhundred and four pounds, and _The Recuyles of the historyes of Troye_,\r\n1503; _Bartholomaeus de proprietatibus rerum_, about 1495; and _The\r\nExample of Vertue_, 1530, all printed by Wynkyn de Worde, one hundred\r\nand fourteen pounds, sixty pounds, and fifty-eight pounds. Mr. Corser's\r\nfour Shakespeare folios sold for one hundred and sixty pounds,\r\nforty-nine pounds, seventy-seven pounds, and twelve pounds, while the\r\nfirst edition of the _Sonnets_ realised forty-five pounds, and the 1636\r\nedition of _Venus and Adonis_ fifty-five pounds. Some other rare books,\r\nand the prices obtained for them, were the _Sarum Missal_, printed at\r\nParis in 1514, eighty-seven pounds; _Biblia Pauperum_ (A. Verard, Paris,\r\nabout 1503), ninety-nine pounds; _Guy de Waruich_ (Paris, 1525), two\r\nhundred and eighty-two pounds; unique copy of an edition of _Huon of\r\nBordeaux_, thought to have been printed by Pynson, eighty-one pounds;\r\n_Nurcerie of Names_, by Guillam de Warrino (William Warren) (London,\r\n1581), one hundred pounds; Daye's _Daphnis and Chloe_ (London, 1587),\r\nunique, sixty pounds; _The Three Ladies of London_, by W.R. (London,\r\n1592), seventy-six pounds; _The Phoenix Nest_ (London, 1593),\r\nsixty-four pounds, ten shillings; Chute's _Beawtie Dishonoured_\r\n(London, 1593), one hundred and five pounds; _Maroccus Extaticus, or\r\nBankes Bay Horse_ (London, 1595), one hundred and ten pounds; the first\r\nfive editions of Walton's _Compleat Angler_, one hundred and forty\r\npounds; and twenty early ballads in black letter, bound in a volume,\r\neighty-nine pounds.\r\n\r\nThe more important manuscripts in the collection were _Le Romant des\r\nTrois Pelerinages_, by Guillaume de Guilleville, written on vellum in\r\nthe fourteenth century, and ornamented with many illuminations and\r\ndrawings, two hundred and ten pounds; _Bartholomaeus De Proprietatibus\r\nRerum_, vellum, richly illuminated, fourteenth century, ninety-one\r\npounds; a _Poem on the Lord's Prayer_, by John Kylyngwyke, vellum,\r\nfourteenth century, seventy pounds; _Lyf of Oure Lady_, by John Lydgate,\r\nfifteenth century, written and illuminated on vellum, forty-six pounds;\r\nand _Officium Beatae Mariae Virginis_, fifteenth century, illuminated,\r\nsixty-four pounds.\r\n\r\nSome additional manuscripts and books which had belonged to Mr. Corser\r\nwere sold after his death, at Manchester, by Capes, Dunn and Pilcher on\r\nDecember the 13th, 1876, and two following days. These realised one\r\nthousand four hundred and eight pounds, sixteen shillings and sixpence.\r\nAmong them was the original manuscript of Cavendish's _Life of Wolsey_,\r\nwhich fetched sixty guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID LAING, 1793-1878\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Laing, the eminent Scottish antiquary, was the second son of\r\nWilliam Laing, a bookseller in Edinburgh, and was born in that city on\r\nthe 20th of April 1793. He was educated at the Canongate Grammar School,\r\nand afterwards attended the Greek classes of Professor Dalzel at the\r\nEdinburgh University.[98] At an early age he was apprenticed to his\r\nfather, and in the year 1821 he entered into partnership with him. His\r\nfather died in 1832, and David Laing continued to carry on the business\r\nuntil 1837, when, having been elected librarian to the Society of\r\nWriters to H.M. Signet, he gave it up, and disposed of his stock by\r\npublic sale. Laing was Honorary Secretary of the Bannatyne Club from its\r\nfoundation by Sir Walter Scott in 1823 to its dissolution thirty-eight\r\nyears later, and himself edited a large number of its publications. He\r\nalso edited papers for the Spalding, Abbotsford, and Hunterian Clubs,\r\nand the Shakespeare and Wodrow Societies; while his contributions to the\r\n_Proceedings_ of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, of which he was\r\nelected a Fellow in 1826, consisted of upwards of one hundred separate\r\npapers. In 1864 the University of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree\r\nof LL.D. He died unmarried on the 18th of October 1878.\r\n\r\nLaing's life was one of great literary activity, and although he did not\r\nproduce any large original work, he edited many of the writings of the\r\nold Scottish authors. His acquaintance with the early literary and\r\necclesiastical history, as well as the art and antiquities, of Scotland\r\nwas very extensive; and Lockhart, in _Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk_,\r\nstates that he possessed a 'truly wonderful degree of skill and\r\nknowledge in all departments of bibliography.' A list of the various\r\npublications issued under his editorial superintendence from 1815 to\r\n1878 inclusive, together with his lectures on Scottish art, appear in a\r\ncollection of privately printed notices of him edited by T.G. Stevenson,\r\nEdinburgh, 1878.\r\n\r\nLaing availed himself of his exceptional opportunities to form a very\r\nlarge and fine library, which was particularly rich in books\r\nillustrative of the history and literature of Scotland, many of which\r\nwere of excessive rarity, and several unique. Nearly every publication\r\nrelating to Mary Queen of Scots was to be found in it. After Laing's\r\ndeath his library, with the exception of his manuscripts, which he\r\nbequeathed to the University of Edinburgh, was sold in four portions by\r\nSotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge.\r\n\r\n     _First Sale_--\r\n\r\n     December 1st, 1879, and ten following days.

He developed a taste for\r\nbook-buying at a very early age. It is said that his first purchase was\r\nmade in 1814, when, a boy at Westminster School, he bought a copy of the\r\n_Secretes_ of Albertus Magnus for eighteenpence at Ginger's well-known\r\nshop in Great College Street, and at the time of his death he had\r\namassed a library which ranked among the first in the kingdom.\r\nMagnificent as was his collection of printed books, the library was even\r\nstill more notable for the manuscripts it contained, which amounted to\r\nnearly four thousand, and were remarkable for their value and\r\nimportance. In addition to those which he bought separately, Lord\r\nAshburnham acquired in 1847 the manuscripts of Count Guglielmo Libri for\r\neight thousand pounds, and in 1849 he purchased the Stowe manuscripts\r\nfor the same sum, and those of Jean Barrois for six thousand pounds.\r\nFive years after the death of Lord Ashburnham, his successor, the\r\npresent Earl, offered the manuscripts, for one hundred and sixty\r\nthousand pounds, to the Trustees of the British Museum, who were\r\nanxious to purchase them for that sum. The Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nhowever, declined to find the money for the entire collection, but the\r\nStowe manuscripts were acquired by the Government for forty-five\r\nthousand pounds, and divided between the British Museum and the library\r\nof the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. To the latter institution were\r\ngiven the Irish manuscripts and certain volumes specially relating to\r\nIreland. It had long been suspected that many of the manuscripts in the\r\nLibri and Barrois collections had been abstracted from French and\r\nItalian public libraries, and when this was proved to have been the\r\ncase, principally through the researches of M. Delisle, the Director of\r\nthe Bibliotheque Nationale, it was arranged between the Trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum and the French authorities that should the former become\r\npossessors of the manuscripts, they would return the stolen volumes for\r\nthe sum of twenty-four thousand pounds. As the Treasury refused to\r\nsanction the purchase of the whole of the Ashburnham manuscripts, this\r\narrangement could not be carried out, and in 1887 the manuscripts, one\r\nhundred and sixty-six in number, stolen from the French and Italian\r\nlibraries, were bought by Mr. Karl Truebner, acting as agent for the\r\nGrand Duke of Baden and the German Imperial authorities, for the same\r\nsum as the French had been willing to pay for them. The primary object\r\nof this transaction, says Mr. F.S. Ellis in his excellent account of the\r\nlibrary in Quaritch's _Dictionary of English Book-Collectors_, 'was to\r\nrecover the famous Manesse Liederbuch, a thirteenth century MS. carried\r\naway by the French from Heidelberg in 1656, the loss of which had ever\r\nsince been regarded as a national calamity in Germany. For L6000 in cash\r\nand this precious volume, he handed over the 166 Libri and Barrois MSS.\r\nto the Bibliotheque Nationale. By a simple arithmetical process, we can\r\nconclude that L18,000 was the net cost to the German Exchequer of a\r\nsingle volume of old German ballads--the highest price ever paid for a\r\nbook.' The stolen manuscripts which were not required to replace those\r\ntaken from the French libraries, were purchased by the Italian\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. Yates Thompson is understood to have purchased that portion of the\r\nother manuscripts in the library known as 'The Appendix,' for about\r\nforty thousand pounds, and after selecting those he required for his own\r\ncollection, to have sent the remainder to the auction rooms of Sotheby,\r\nWilkinson and Hodge, where they were sold on May the 1st, 1899. There\r\nwere one hundred and seventy-seven lots in the sale, which realised\r\neight thousand five hundred and ninety-five pounds, five shillings. The\r\nchoicest manuscript in the catalogue was an important text of the later\r\nversion (1400-40) of 'Wycliffe's English Bible,' known as the 'Bramhall\r\nManuscript,' which was knocked down to Mr. Quaritch for seventeen\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. Other fine manuscripts were a copy of the\r\n_Historia Ecclesiastica_ of the Venerable Bede, written in the eighth\r\ncentury; an _Evangeliarium_ of the twelfth century, with beautiful\r\nilluminations; _Officia Liturgica_, fifteenth century; and _Horae Beatae\r\nMariae Virginis_, written in the sixteenth century, richly illuminated.\r\nThese realised respectively two hundred and thirty pounds, three hundred\r\npounds, four hundred and sixty-seven pounds, and three hundred pounds.\r\nOn the 10th of June 1901 and the four following days the manuscripts in\r\nthe Barrois Collection, not previously disposed of, were sold by the\r\nsame auctioneers. There were six hundred and twenty-eight lots in this\r\nsale, and the very large sum of thirty-three thousand two hundred and\r\nseventeen pounds, six shillings and sixpence was obtained for them, the\r\nchoicest manuscripts fetching exceptionally high prices. The manuscripts\r\nwere of great importance and much interest. Among them were to be found\r\nearly copies of the Gospels and Epistles, and beautifully illuminated\r\nmanuscripts of the Latin and Italian Classics, Books of Devotion, and\r\nearly French Romances and Chronicles. The collection also contained a\r\nnumber of papers relating to Mary, Queen of Scots, and a valuable\r\nseries of Anglo-Norman Charters, etc. The following are a few of the\r\nmore interesting and valuable manuscripts, together with the prices they\r\nrealised:--_Roman du Saint Graal et Lancelot du Lac_, on vellum, in\r\nthree folio volumes, with beautifully painted miniatures and initials,\r\nfourteenth century--eighteen hundred pounds; _Psalterium Latinum_, on\r\nvellum, fourteenth century, with paintings attributed to Giotto--fifteen\r\nhundred and thirty pounds; _Vie du vaillant Bertrand du Guesclin_,\r\nwritten on vellum in the fourteenth century, with miniatures in _camaieu\r\ngris_--fifteen hundred pounds; _La Legende Doree_, translated by Jehan\r\nde Vignay, fifteenth century, on vellum, with a large number of very\r\nfine illuminated miniatures and ornamental initials--fifteen hundred\r\npounds; _Chronique Generale dite de la Bourcachardiere_, by Jehan de\r\nCourcy, in two large folio volumes, on vellum, with large illuminations,\r\nfifteenth century--fourteen hundred and twenty pounds; _Horae Beatae Mariae\r\nVirginis_, with very fine illuminations, fifteenth century--eleven\r\nhundred and sixty pounds; _Histoire Universelle_, on vellum, in two\r\nvolumes, with miniatures in _camaieu gris_, fifteenth century--nine\r\nhundred and ten pounds; _Dante_, vellum, richly illuminated, fourteenth\r\ncentury--six hundred and thirty pounds. The collection of Anglo-Norman\r\nCharters fetched three hundred and five pounds, and the Letters and\r\nPapers relating to Mary, Queen of Scots, one hundred and ninety-six\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of fifty years Lord Ashburnham availed himself of every\r\nopportunity of acquiring the finest and most perfect copies obtainable\r\nof the rarest and choicest books, and he brought together a collection\r\nof printed volumes which was well worthy of being associated with that\r\nof his manuscripts. It was especially rich in Bibles, and in Missals,\r\nHorae and other Service Books, and in the early editions of Dante,\r\nBoccaccio and Chaucer. Among the Bibles and portions of the Scriptures\r\nwere a block-book, a copy of the _Biblia Pauperum_, regarded by\r\nHeinecken as the second edition of that work; vellum and paper copies of\r\nthe Gutenberg Bible; a vellum copy of the 1462 Latin Bible; a perfect\r\ncopy of Tyndale's translation of the Pentateuch, printed at 'Marlborow'\r\nby Hans Loft in 1534; and the Coverdale Bible of 1535. Of foreign\r\nincunabula there was a large number; of Caxtons a very goodly list,[99]\r\nbut comparatively few of them perfect; and the rarest productions of the\r\npress of St. Albans, and of those of Machlinia, Lettou, Pynson, Wynkyn\r\nde Worde, Copland, and other early English printers were to be found in\r\nthe library. The collection of the editions of the _Book of Hawking,\r\nHunting_, etc., attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, may be considered to\r\nhave been unique, for it included the _Book of St. Albans_, printed in\r\n1486, the extremely rare edition printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1496, the\r\nthree editions printed by William Copland, those of William Powell and\r\nJohn Waley, and the only known copy of the first separate edition of\r\n_Fysshynge with an Angle_, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1532. Other\r\nrare English books were the first edition of the first _Reformed\r\nPrimer_, printed in 1535; an _Abridgement of the Chronicles of\r\nEnglande_, printed by Grafton in 1570, which belonged to Thomas Howard,\r\nDuke of Norfolk, who was beheaded in 1572, with an interesting letter\r\nwritten by him on the blank space of the reverse of the last leaf,\r\nshortly before his death; _The Principal Navigations, etc., of the\r\nEnglish Nation_, by Richard Hakluyt, printed in 1598-1600, with the very\r\nrare map having the Voyage of Sir Francis Drake, 1577, and that of\r\nStandish, 1587, and the original suppressed pages of the Voyage to\r\nCadiz; the four Shakespeare folios, and the first five editions of\r\nWalton's _Compleat Angler_, in the original bindings (three sheep and\r\ntwo calf) as issued by the publisher. Books also worthy of special\r\nnotice were the beautifully illuminated copies of Boccaccio's _Ruine des\r\nNobles Hommes_, printed by Colard Mansion at Bruges in 1476; the _Opera\r\nVaria Latine_ of Aristotle, printed on vellum by Andrea de Asula at\r\nVenice in 1483; and _Heures de la Vierge Marie_, also printed on vellum,\r\nby Geoffroy Tory in 1525. A catalogue of the more rare and curious\r\nprinted books in the library was privately printed in 1864.\r\n\r\nAlthough bookbindings did not form a special feature of the library,\r\nLord Ashburnham possessed some remarkably fine and interesting examples\r\nof them. That on a tenth century manuscript of the Gospels, which for\r\nmany centuries belonged to the Abbey of Noble Canonesses at Lindau, on\r\nthe Lake of Constance, is one of the finest specimens of gold and\r\njewelled bindings to be found in any collection. This beautiful work of\r\nart, the lower cover of which is of the eighth century and the upper of\r\nthe ninth, is of gold or silver gilt, and is profusely decorated with\r\njewels. It is described in the _Vetusta Monumenta_ of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, and was shown at the Exhibition of Bookbindings at the\r\nBurlington Fine Arts Club in 1891.[100] The collection also contained a\r\nparticularly fine mosaic binding, with doublures, by Monnier, and many\r\nvolumes from the libraries of Grolier, Maioli, the Emperor Charles V.,\r\nDe Thou, etc.\r\n\r\nLord Ashburnham's printed books were sold in three portions in 1897 and\r\n1898 by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge. The first sale took place on June\r\n25th, 1897, and seven following days; the second on December 6th, 1897,\r\nand five following days, and the third on May 9th, 1898, and five\r\nfollowing days. There were four thousand and seventy-five lots in the\r\nthree sales, and the total amount realised was sixty-two thousand seven\r\nhundred and twelve pounds, seven shillings and sixpence.\r\n\r\nVery high prices were obtained for the books. The _Biblia Pauperum_\r\nblock-book sold for a thousand and fifty pounds; the vellum copy of the\r\nGutenberg Bible for four thousand pounds, the largest sum paid for a\r\ncopy of this Bible, and the highest but one ever given for a printed\r\nbook (Lord Ashburnham's copy on paper was sold privately to Mr. Quaritch\r\nfor three thousand pounds); the Latin Bible of 1462 for fifteen hundred\r\npounds; and the Coverdale Bible and Tyndale's Pentateuch for eight\r\nhundred and twenty pounds, and two hundred pounds. The illuminated\r\ncopies of Boccaccio's _Ruine des Nobles Hommes_, printed by Colard\r\nMansion; Aristotle's _Opera Varia Latine_, printed by Andrea de Asula;\r\nand the _Heures de la Vierge Marie_, printed by Geoffroy Tory, realised\r\nsix hundred and ninety-five pounds, eight hundred pounds, and eight\r\nhundred and sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nOf the Caxtons the _Life of Jason_ and the _Dictes_ fetched the highest\r\nprices--two thousand one hundred pounds, and thirteen hundred and twenty\r\npounds; the former being the largest sum ever paid for any Caxton book.\r\nThree hundred and eighty-five pounds were obtained for the 'Book of St.\r\nAlbans'; one thousand pounds for Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, printed\r\nby Wynkyn de Worde in 1498, believed to be the only copy extant; and\r\nthree hundred and sixty pounds for the _Treatyse of Fysshing with an\r\nAngle_, by the same printer. This little book, which consists of sixteen\r\nleaves, and without the covers weighs about two ounces, sold for nearly\r\nforty-five times its weight in gold. The first edition of the _Reformed\r\nPrimer_ sold for two hundred and twenty-five pounds; Grafton's\r\n_Chronicle_, with the letter of the Duke of Norfolk, for seventy pounds;\r\nand a vellum copy of the _Tewrdannck_ for three hundred and ten pounds.\r\n\r\nThe first folio Shakespeare, which was slightly imperfect, was bought by\r\nMr. Sotheran for five hundred and eighty-five pounds, for presentation\r\nto the Memorial Library, Stratford-on-Avon. The second folio fetched\r\nninety pounds, and the third one hundred and ninety pounds. Hakluyt's\r\n_Navigations_ sold for two hundred and seventy-five pounds, and the set\r\nof the first five editions of the _Compleat Angler_ for eight hundred\r\npounds. At the Corser sale they realised but one hundred and forty\r\npounds. The copy of _Merlin_ with the Monnier binding brought seven\r\nhundred and sixty pounds, and a collection of early impressions of\r\nsixty-two prints by Albert Duerer three hundred and fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Eighteen are mentioned in Blades's _Life and Typography of\r\nCaxton_.

He was born in London in 1798, and after receiving his\r\neducation at private schools, became a pupil of David Laing, the\r\narchitect of the Custom House. Sir William Tite designed many buildings\r\nin London and the provinces, and a considerable number of the more\r\nimportant railway stations; but the work with which his name is\r\nespecially associated was the rebuilding of the Royal Exchange, which\r\ncost L150,000, and was opened by the Queen on the 28th of October 1844.\r\nIn 1838 he was elected President of the Architectural Society, and of\r\nthe Royal Institute of British Architects from 1861-63, and from\r\n1867-70. He entered Parliament in 1855 as Member for Bath, and continued\r\nto represent that constituency until his death. In 1869 he was knighted,\r\nand in the following year he received the Companionship of the Bath. Sir\r\nWilliam was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and also of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries. He died at Torquay on April 20th, 1873, and was buried in\r\nNorwood Cemetery.\r\n\r\nSir William Tite was an ardent collector of manuscripts, books, and\r\nworks of art, and he formed a very large and choice library, which\r\ncontained many valuable manuscripts, and a great number of rare early\r\nEnglish books. It was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, in May and\r\nJune 1874. The sale occupied sixteen days, and realised nineteen\r\nthousand nine hundred and forty-three pounds, six shillings. There were\r\nthree thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven lots.\r\n\r\nAmong the more notable manuscripts in the library were a richly\r\nilluminated _Lectionarium_, written on vellum about A.D. 1150 at the\r\nmonastery of Ottenbeuren in Suabia, which sold for five hundred and\r\nfifty pounds; a Wycliffe New Testament on vellum of the first half of\r\nthe fifteenth century, which brought two hundred and forty-one pounds; a\r\ncopy of the Four Gospels of about the same period, which fetched one\r\nhundred and eight pounds; a number of Horae and other service books, and\r\nthree devotional works written by Jarry, the famous French\r\ncalligraphist. There were also the original manuscripts of three of the\r\nnovels of Sir Walter Scott--_Peveril of the Peak_, the first volume of\r\nthe _Tales of my Landlord (The Black Dwarf)_, and _Woodstock_, which\r\ntogether realised three hundred and ninety-eight pounds. The collection\r\nalso contained a block-book, _The Apocalypse_, which brought two hundred\r\nand eighty-five pounds; four Caxtons, the most important of which--a\r\nperfect copy of the second edition of the _Mirrour of the World_--sold\r\nfor four hundred and fifty-five pounds; and many books from the presses\r\nof Machlinia, Pynson, Wynkyn de Worde, Notary, and other early English\r\nprinters. Shakespeare was well represented. The first three folios were\r\nto be found in the library, as well as the first editions of _Lucrece_\r\nand the _Sonnets_, and a large number of the quarto plays. The first\r\nfolio and _Lucrece_ realised respectively four hundred and forty pounds\r\nand one hundred and ten pounds. There was also a choice collection of\r\nthe works of other writers of the time of Elizabeth and James I. A copy\r\nof the first edition of _Don Quixote_; and a set of the first five\r\neditions of Walton's _Compleat Angler_, which sold for sixty-eight\r\npounds, also deserve especial notice. A series of autographs in thirteen\r\nfolio volumes realised three hundred and twenty-five pounds; and the\r\nsale catalogue contained as many as two hundred and fourteen lots of\r\nautograph letters of Mary Queen of Scots, Lord Bacon, Cromwell, and\r\nother celebrities.\r\n\r\nSir William Tite was the author of a 'Report of a Visit to the Estates\r\nof the Honourable Irish Society in Londonderry and Coleraine in the\r\nyear 1834,' and of a 'Descriptive Catalogue of the Antiquities found in\r\nthe Excavations at the New Royal Exchange,' which he published in 1848.\r\nSeveral of his papers and addresses, which principally treated of\r\nbibliographical or antiquarian subjects, were privately printed. He was\r\na liberal promoter of all schemes for the advancement of education, and\r\nhe founded the Tite Scholarship in the City of London School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES THOMSON GIBSON-CRAIG, 1799-1886\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. James Thomson Gibson-Craig, who was born in March 1799, was the\r\nsecond son of Mr. James Gibson, the political reformer, who, on\r\nsucceeding under entail to the Riccarton estates in 1823, assumed the\r\nname of Craig, and in 1831 was created a baronet. He was educated at the\r\nHigh School and the University of Edinburgh, and after spending some\r\ntime in foreign travel, he became a Writer to the Signet, and joined the\r\nfirm afterwards known as Gibson-Craig, Dalziel and Brodies, of\r\nEdinburgh, of which he continued a member until about the year 1875. Mr.\r\nGibson-Craig was well known for his literary and antiquarian tastes, and\r\nit was principally owing to his exertions that the Historical\r\nManuscripts of Scotland were reproduced and issued during the time his\r\nbrother, Sir William Gibson-Craig, held the office of Lord Clerk\r\nRegister. He was a friend of Sir Walter Scott, of Lord Jeffrey, and Lord\r\nCockburn, and at a later period of Lord Macaulay; and he was also\r\nintimate with most of the principal Scottish artists and antiquaries of\r\nhis time. He died at Edinburgh on the 18th of July 1886. Mr.\r\nGibson-Craig, who began to collect during his student days, formed an\r\nextensive and valuable library of choice books, many of which were bound\r\nby celebrated binders, and were once to be found in such famous\r\nlibraries as those of Grolier, Canevari, Diana of Poitiers, Mary Queen\r\nof Scots, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, De Thou, Count von Hoym,\r\nLongepierre, and Madame de Pompadour. After his death his collection was\r\nsold by Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge in three portions. The first\r\nportion was sold on June the 27th, 1887, and nine following days; the\r\nsecond on March the 23rd, 1888, and five following days, and on April\r\n6th and eight following days; and the third on November the 15th, 1888,\r\nand two following days.

MDLXXXIX, and\r\nthe Form and Manner of Her Majesty's Coronation at Holyroodhouse A.D.\r\nMDXC.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER WILLIAM, TWENTY-FIFTH EARL OF CRAWFORD, 1812-1880\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is about three hundred years since the founder of the Bibliotheca\r\nLindesiana died. John Lindsay, the Octavian, better known by his title\r\nof Lord Menmuir, the ancestor of the Earls of Balcarres, had a\r\ndistinguished though but brief career. He was not quite forty-seven\r\nyears old when he died. During his short though eventful life he took a\r\nleading part in State affairs, being much trusted by his Sovereign, King\r\nJames VI. He was a man of varied talents--lawyer, statesman, man of\r\nbusiness, scholar, man of letters, and a poet. He seems to have been\r\nfamiliar with Greek, and to have corresponded in the Latin language.\r\nBesides these he acquired a knowledge of French, Italian and Spanish. He\r\naccumulated many State papers and letters from distinguished persons\r\nboth at home and abroad.[101] These, now known as 'the Balcarres\r\nPapers,' were presented by Colin, Earl of Balcarres, to the Advocates'\r\nLibrary in 1712. A summary account of them is given in the First Report\r\nof the Historical Manuscripts Commission. Lord Menmuir's library is now\r\nrepresented at Haigh[102] by two volumes and three fragments, all of\r\nwhich bear his autograph. Lord Menmuir was succeeded by a son, who died\r\nwhilst yet a youth and unmarried. The second son, David, who after his\r\nbrother's death inherited the estate of Balcarres, may be termed the\r\nsecond founder of the library. The father's love of books and learning\r\nseems to have in a very large measure descended to the son. He added to\r\nthe library until it became one of the best in the kingdom. A very\r\ncharming letter from William Drummond of Hawthornden to David Lindsay,\r\nsent with a copy of the _Flowers of Zion_, which the poet had privately\r\nprinted, is clear evidence of the terms on which Lindsay lived with his\r\nfriends and fellow book-lovers. The original letter is preserved in the\r\nMuniment Room at Haigh, but the identical copy of Drummond's work has,\r\nalas! been lost sight of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SMALL BOOK-STAMP OF THE FIRST LORD BALCARRES.]\r\n\r\nThe library of Sir David Lindsay, Lord Balcarres, continued at the\r\nfamily seat on the shores of the Firth of Forth until comparatively\r\nrecent times. Sibbald in 1710 mentions the 'great bibliothek' at\r\nBalcarres. In Sibbald's time the owner, Colin, third Earl of Balcarres,\r\nhad added many books to the library, and spent the evening of his days\r\nin the pursuit of letters. When Lady Balcarres, great-grandmother of the\r\npresent Earl of Crawford, left Fife and removed to Edinburgh, whilst her\r\nson was in the West Indies, the greater portion of the library was\r\nliterally thrown away and dispersed--torn up for grocers as useless\r\ntrash, by her permission. Of the library collected by generations of\r\nLindsays, all that now remains is a handful of little over fifty\r\nvolumes. The books of David Lindsay, first Lord Balcarres, who died in\r\n1641, are recognisable from his signature, and on many of them his arms\r\nare impressed in gold on the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LARGE BOOK-STAMP OF THE FIRST LORD BALCARRES.]\r\n\r\nOf the present library at Haigh, the nucleus of it may be said to be the\r\nbooks inherited by the grandfather of the present Earl, whose wife was\r\nthe heiress of the first Baron Muncaster. These Muncaster books,\r\nalthough not of the greatest value, formed a basis on which the late\r\nEarl of Crawford, who was born in 1812, built up the present library,\r\nwhich will be always associated with his memory. When a boy he was fired\r\nwith enthusiasm for books, and determined to form a great library in\r\nwhich every branch of human knowledge in every language should have a\r\nplace. He began collecting about 1826, shortly after going to Eton, and\r\ncontinued most assiduously to gather of all that was best until his\r\ndeath in 1880. His success may be judged in some measure by the\r\nremarkable collections dispersed in 1887 and 1889, which together\r\nconsisted of three thousand two hundred and fifty-four lots, and\r\nrealised twenty-six thousand three hundred and ninety-seven pounds,\r\nfourteen shillings. Family burdens rendered it needful for the present\r\npossessor of the library to put his hands on some available assets, and\r\nthis necessity coming at a period of great commercial depression, a\r\nportion of the literary treasures unfortunately suffered. But the work\r\nwas again renewed, and the present state of the library will not compare\r\nignobly with its past. The number of manuscripts is very considerable,\r\nprobably about six thousand, not a few of which are of the greatest\r\ninterest and value, many of them having covers of the precious metals or\r\ncarved ivory, enriched with gems and crystals. There are also many\r\npapyri, a great number of Oriental manuscripts, collections of French\r\nautograph letters of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods, and of\r\nEnglish autograph letters. The printed books amount to about one hundred\r\nthousand, and among them are to be found several block-books and a large\r\nnumber of incunabula, including books printed by Caxton, Machlinia,\r\nWynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Rood, and other early English printers. The\r\nlibrary is particularly rich in the productions of the early Italian\r\npresses, especially those of Rome and Venice; and it also contains a\r\nfine collection of rare works on the languages of North and South\r\nAmerica, many of them printed in Mexico and Lima, and a series of books\r\nprinted in Aberdeen from 1622 to 1736. Of other printed matter there are\r\ncollections of broadside ballads; broadside proclamations illustrative\r\nof English, French, Dutch, German and Italian history; a long series of\r\nPapal Bulls; early English newspapers from 1631 to the Restoration;\r\nCivil War tracts; tracts by, for and against Martin Luther; newspapers\r\nand periodicals published during the various French revolutions; and a\r\nlarge number of caricatures issued in France and Germany during the\r\nSecond Empire and the Commune.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy task to pick out the choicest gems from the abundant\r\ntreasures of this splendid collection, but the following are a few of\r\nthe most interesting and valuable of the manuscripts:\r\n\r\nA Legal Instrument of Donation from Johannes, the Primicerius, or\r\nCaptain of a company of soldiers, to the Church of Ravenna; written on\r\npapyrus, probably about A.D. 580-600, at Ravenna. Five feet four inches\r\nlong by eleven and a half inches broad.\r\n\r\nThe Four Gospels in Syriac, in the original Peshitto version, written on\r\nvellum about 550.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, _Epistolae et Opuscula_, written in the\r\nseventh or eighth century in rude Merovingian characters, often mixed\r\nwith uncial letters. One of the oldest manuscripts in existence of this\r\nFather of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe Four Gospels in Latin, written about 850.\r\n\r\nA Textus or Book of the Gospels, probably written at the Benedictine\r\nmonastery of St. Gall, Switzerland, in the ninth or tenth century. In\r\nthe centre of the upper cover, which is intended to be used as a pax at\r\nMass, is an ivory panel of the Crucifixion, with figures of the Virgin\r\nMary and St. John the Evangelist. The border is of gilt copper engraved\r\nwith a floriated pattern, and studded with silver bosses and jewels; at\r\nthe corners are Limoges enamel plaques with the four Evangelists. The\r\nivory carving is of the tenth or eleventh century, the border early\r\nthirteenth.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament in Syriac: the Gospels of the Peshitto version, and\r\nthe remaining books of the Heraclean version, written about 1000.\r\nRemarkable as being the only complete Syriac New Testament of any\r\nantiquity in any library in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Old Testament in Latin, written by a German scribe in the eleventh\r\ncentury. The upper cover consists of a carved ivory panel of the\r\nthirteenth century, with a border of silver gilt, decorated with\r\nfiligree work and figures in _repousse_, and enriched with crystals _en\r\ncabochon_.\r\n\r\nSt. Beatus, _Commentarius in Apocalypsim_, written in Spain about 1150;\r\nwith one hundred and ten very large miniatures and a circular map of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n_Bible Historiee_, executed in the south of France about 1250; a series\r\nof full-page paintings on a background of burnished gold, representing\r\nscenes from the Book of Genesis.\r\n\r\n_Psalterium_, written in Paris about 1260. This volume belonged at one\r\ntime to Joan of Navarre, Queen Consort of Henry IV., King of England,\r\nwhose autograph is on one of the blank leaves.\r\n\r\n_Roman de la Rose_, written for, and presented to, Christina de\r\nLindesay, Dame de Coucy, 1323.\r\n\r\n_Rime di Petrarca et Canconi di Dante._ One of the most important\r\nmanuscripts of the two poets, written during the lifetime of Petrarch,\r\nor immediately after his death, by Paul the Scribe for Lorenzo, the son\r\nof Carlo degli Strozzi, a member of one of the noblest families of\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nLydgate's _Siege of Troy_, probably written for William Carent, of\r\nCarent's Court, in the Isle of Purbeck, about 1420. The volume has\r\nilluminated borders and seventy miniatures, and bears the arms of Carent\r\nat the end.\r\n\r\n_Missale Romanum_, six volumes folio, written on vellum in 1510-17 for\r\nCardinal Pompeo Colonna. The tradition handed down by the family was\r\nthat the large full-page illuminations with which the manuscript is\r\nadorned were executed by Raphael about the year 1517, when the owner was\r\nmade a cardinal; and there is no doubt that, if not actually by his\r\nhand, the work was done by his followers under his supervision. In all\r\nprobability, we may say that the large miniatures are painted by Timoteo\r\nViti, and the illuminations and arabesques by Litti di Filippo de'\r\nCorbizi.[103]\r\n\r\nSome of the more notable of the incunabula are two block-books--the\r\nfirst Dutch edition of the _Speculum Humanae Salvationis_, and a copy of\r\nthe _Ars Memorativa_ printed before 1474-75. Cicero, _Officiorum libri\r\ntres_, printed at Mentz by Fust and Schoeffer in 1465. Lactantius,\r\n_Opera_, printed in the Monastery of Subiaco, near Rome, by Sweynheym\r\nand Pannartz in 1465. Higden's _Polychronicon_ and the _Boke of\r\nEneydos_, printed by Caxton in 1482 and 1490. The _Chronicles of\r\nEngland_ and the _Speculum Christiani_, printed by Machlinia. Lyndewode,\r\n_Constitutiones provinciales ecclesiae anglicanae_, printed at Oxford by\r\nRood and Hunte in 1483-85. The _Croniclis of Engl[=o]de with the frute\r\nof timis_, from the St. Albans press.\r\n\r\nAmong other books of later dates deserving of special notice may be\r\nmentioned--Vespucci, _Paesi novamente retrovati_, Vicenza, 1507. The\r\nfirst and very rare edition of the celebrated Thesis of Luther against\r\nthe system of indulgences, which he affixed to the gate of the\r\nUniversity of Wittemberg, 1517. _Huon of Bordeaux_, printed by Wynkyn\r\nde Worde about 1534--believed to be unique. Archbishop Parker's _De\r\nAntiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae_, London, 1572. A magnificent set of De\r\nBry's _Grands et Petits Voyages_, in one hundred and eighty-two volumes,\r\n1590-1644. A Booke containing all such Proclamations as were published\r\nduring the Raigne of Elizabeth (and James I.); collected by Humphrey\r\nDyson, London, 1618. The first and second Shakespeare folios. Three\r\ncopies of the first edition of Milton's _Paradise Lost_, with the first,\r\nthird and fourth title-pages.\r\n\r\nThe immense collection of broadsides forms one of the most remarkable\r\nfeatures of this magnificent library. In volume iv. p. 201 of the\r\n_Transactions of the Bibliographical Society_, published in 1898, Lord\r\nCrawford informs us that 'in the last fourteen or fifteen years he had\r\nmanaged to collect something like nineteen thousand of them, including\r\nEnglish, French, German and Venetian Proclamations (3000), Papal Bulls\r\n(11,000) and English Ballads (3000).' Among them are several very rare\r\nindulgences printed by Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson, and a large number of\r\nproclamations and ballads of special interest and value, far too\r\nnumerous to mention.\r\n\r\nThe present Earl of Crawford, who is a Trustee of the British Museum,\r\nPresident of the Camden Society, a Fellow of the Royal Society and the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries, and who was formerly President of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society, has printed catalogues of the English broadsides\r\nand ballads, and of the Chinese books and manuscripts in his collection,\r\ntogether with hand-lists to the Oriental manuscripts, the early editions\r\nof the Greek and Latin writers, and the proclamations issued by\r\nauthority of the kings and queens of Great Britain and Ireland. He has\r\nalso printed collations and notes of some of the rare books in the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: Mainly contributed by Mr. J.P. Edmond, Librarian to Lord\r\nCrawford.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Lord Crawford's Seat, near Wigan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: Since the above was printed it has been announced that\r\nLord Crawford's MSS. have become by purchase the property of Mrs.\r\nRylands of Manchester.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY HUTH, 1815-1878\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Huth, who was born in London in 1815, was the third son of Mr.\r\nFrederick Huth of Hanover, who settled at Corunna, in Spain; but on the\r\noccupation of that town by the French in 1809 he came to England, where\r\nhe became a naturalised British subject, and founded the well-known firm\r\nwhich is still carried on by his descendants. Mr. Henry Huth, we are\r\ninformed in the preface to the Catalogue of the Huth Library, written by\r\nhis son, Mr. Alfred Henry Huth, was intended for the Indian Civil\r\nService, and was sent to Mr. Rusden's school at Leith Hill in Surrey,\r\nwhere he 'learned Greek, Latin, and French (Spanish was his\r\nmother-tongue), and had also got well on with Hindustani, Persian, and\r\nArabic'; but in 1833, the East India Company having lost their Charter,\r\nhis father removed him from the school and took him into his business.\r\nOffice-work proving distasteful to him, he travelled for some years on\r\nthe Continent and in America, rejoining his father's firm as partner in\r\n1849. From his early years Mr. Henry Huth had been a collector of books,\r\nand on his return home he set energetically to work to form that\r\nsplendid library which ranks among the finest in England, and which has\r\nbeen carefully preserved and augmented by his son, Mr. Alfred Henry\r\nHuth. Mr. Henry Huth gave commissions at most of the important\r\nbook-sales, and we are told that 'he called daily at all the principal\r\nbooksellers on his way back from the city, a habit which he continued up\r\nto the day of his death.' He was a member of the Philobiblon Society,\r\nand in 1867 printed for presentation to the members a volume of _Ancient\r\nBallads and Broadsides published in England in the Sixteenth Century_,\r\nreprinted from the unique original copies he had bought at the Daniel\r\nsale. He was also a member of the Roxburghe Club. Mr. Huth died on the\r\n10th of December 1878, and was buried in the churchyard of Bolney, in\r\nSussex. He married Augusta Louisa Sophia, third daughter of Frederick\r\nWestenholz of Waldenstein Castle, in Austria, by whom he had three sons\r\nand three daughters.\r\n\r\nAmong the treasures in Mr. Huth's library are block-books of the _Ars\r\nMoriendi_, _Ars Memorandi_, and the _Apocalypse_; the superb copy of the\r\nGutenberg Bible which was formerly in the libraries of Sir M. Masterman\r\nSykes and Mr. Henry Perkins; two copies of the Fust and Schoeffer Bible\r\nof 1462, one on vellum; and a particularly fine copy of St. Augustine's\r\n_De Civitate Dei_, printed at Rome in 1468. The collection also\r\ncomprises several of the pre-Reformation German Bibles; the first\r\nedition of Luther's Bible; the Coverdale Bible of 1535, and the\r\nIcelandic Bible printed at Holum in 1584; together with upwards of one\r\nhundred other Bibles, a large number of New Testaments, and various\r\nportions of the Scriptures in all languages.\r\n\r\nIn books from the presses of Caxton and other early English printers the\r\nlibrary is remarkably rich. It contains no less than twelve Caxtons;\r\nabout fifty Wynkyn de Wordes, of which several are unique; sixteen\r\nPynsons, and a Machlinia. A vellum copy--the only one known--of the\r\n_Fructus Temporum_, printed at St. Albans about 1483; and the _Exposicio\r\nSancti Jeronimi in Symbolum Apostolorum_, printed at Oxford, and bearing\r\nthe date 1468 (a typographical error for 1478), are also found on its\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nAmong the books printed by Caxton are the first editions of _The Dictes\r\nor Sayings of the Philosophers_, Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, _Tully\r\nof Old Age_, Gower's _Confessio Amantis_, and Christine de Pisan's\r\n_Fayts of Arms_.\r\n\r\nThe books from the presses of foreign printers are both numerous and\r\nfine. Some of the most notable examples are the Dantes of Foligno and\r\nMantua, both printed in the year 1472; the first edition of Homer,\r\nprinted at Venice in 1488; a magnificent copy on thick paper, with the\r\noriginal binding, of the _Poliphili Hypnerotomachia_, printed by Aldus\r\nat Venice in 1499; the Aldine Virgil of 1501, with the book-plate of\r\nBilibald Pirkheimer; and two copies of the _Tewrdannck_, one on vellum,\r\nprinted at Nuremberg in 1517. There is also a copy of the first edition\r\nof _Don Quixote_, with the Privilege only for Madrid.\r\n\r\nFew collections are richer than the Huth Library in old English poetry\r\nand dramatic literature. It contains the first four folio Shakespeares,\r\nand a goodly gathering of quarto plays, many of which were acquired at\r\nthe Daniel sale in 1864. Among them are the first editions of _Richard\r\nII._ and _Richard III._, printed in 1597; _Henry V._, _Much Ado about\r\nNothing_, _Midsummer Night's Dream_, and the _Merchant of Venice_, all\r\nprinted in 1600; the first sketch of _The Merry Wives of Windsor_,\r\nprinted in 1602; the second edition of _Hamlet_, printed in 1604; and\r\nthe first editions of _Pericles_, printed in 1609, and _Othello_,\r\nprinted in 1622. Other rare Shakespeareana are the first editions of\r\n_Lucrece_, the _Sonnets_, and the _Poems_, printed respectively in 1594,\r\n1609, and 1640. It is only possible to mention a few of the rare English\r\nbooks in this grand library; but the _Hundred Merry Tales_, published by\r\nRastell about 1525; the unique copy of Munday's _Banquet of Daintie\r\nConceits_, printed in 1588; a first folio of Ben Jonson's _Works_ on\r\nlarge paper, of which only one other copy is known in that state, and a\r\nperfect set of the editions of Walton's _Compleat Angler_ from 1653 to\r\n1760, cannot be passed over without notice. The unique collection of\r\nElizabethan ballads, to which reference has already been made, would be\r\nconsidered a great treasure in any library. The collection of Voyages\r\nand Travels is believed to be the richest private one in Europe. It\r\ncomprises the early letters of Columbus and Vesputius, and perfect\r\neditions of De Bry, Hulsius, Hakluyt, Purchas, etc., together with the\r\nvoyages of Cortes, Drake, and other famous travellers.\r\n\r\nThe fine and large collection of manuscripts contains many choice and\r\ninteresting examples. Several beautifully written Bibles, and a number\r\nof Books of Hours are to be found in it. Some of the latter are most\r\ncharmingly illuminated; two of them, written in the fifteenth century,\r\nof Flemish execution, are especially good. One of these contains the\r\ncoats of arms of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Isabella his\r\nwife. There are also three handsomely illuminated Petrarchs, and a\r\nremarkable manuscript on vellum in four volumes, with very beautiful\r\nillustrations of beasts, birds, fish, and insects, painted by George\r\nHoefnagel for the Emperor Rudolph II. A collection of Madrigals for\r\nthree voices, the words by John Milton, Thomas Tompkins, and others, is\r\nof especial interest, for Mr. A.H. Huth informs us that several of the\r\nsongs by Milton in it have never been published, and that he composed\r\nsome of the music.\r\n\r\nThe library also contains a considerable number of interesting letters,\r\nand a very fine collection of engravings; the series by Albert Duerer\r\nbeing nearly complete. A somewhat recent addition to the collection is\r\n'a proof set before numbers of the engravings to the Landino Dante of\r\n1481, by Baccio Baldini, after the designs of Botticelli, and separately\r\nprinted on slips.'[104]\r\n\r\nMany of the volumes once formed part of the libraries of Grolier,\r\nMaioli, Canevari, Diana of Poitiers, Henry IV. of France, De Thou, Count\r\nMansfeld, Louis XIII., and other celebrated collectors, and bear on\r\ntheir covers the arms or devices of their former owners. There are fine\r\nexamples of the work of all the great binders, and many books bound in\r\nsilver, needlework, etc.\r\n\r\nThe admirable catalogue of the library in five volumes was compiled by\r\nMr. F.S. Ellis and Mr. W.C. Hazlitt, and partly revised by Mr. Henry\r\nHuth himself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Account of additions to the Huth Library, by Mr. A.H.\r\nHuth, in Mr. Quaritch's _Dictionary of English Book-Collectors_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT SAMUEL TURNER, 1818-1887\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Samuel Turner was born in 1818. Although engaged in\r\ncommercial affairs from his youth he was a most enthusiastic\r\nbook-collector, and at a very early age began to form that noble\r\nlibrary, with which only a few collections of his time could vie in\r\nvalue, extent or condition. Mr. Turner principally directed his\r\nattention to the acquisition of rare Italian, French and Spanish books.\r\nHis English books were not numerous, and there were but few German ones\r\nin the collection, but some of them were of much interest. He possessed\r\none of the finest copies in existence of the first folio of\r\nShakespeare's Plays, and an exceptionally good example of the\r\n_Tewrdannck_. He always endeavoured to obtain the best and choicest\r\ncopies possible, and many of them, especially the French volumes, were\r\nclothed in beautiful bindings, bearing the arms or devices of Grolier,\r\nMaioli, Diana of Poitiers, Count Mansfeld, Cosmo de' Medici, Thomas\r\nWotton, Longepierre, Count von Hoym, and other famous collectors. Mr.\r\nTurner resided for some years in Park Square West, Regent's Park,\r\nLondon, but in 1878 he removed to the Albany, Piccadilly. In\r\nanticipation of his change of residence he determined to part with a\r\nportion of his collection of French books, and on the valuation of the\r\nlate M. Potier, of Paris, he offered it to an eminent French amateur _en\r\nbloc_ for four thousand pounds. This offer was declined, and he sent the\r\nbooks to Paris to be sold by auction. The sale took place at the Salle\r\nDrouot on the 12th of March 1878, and the four following days, when the\r\nlots, seven hundred and seventy-four in number, realised three hundred\r\nand nineteen thousand one hundred francs--considerably more than three\r\ntimes the sum Mr. Turner was willing to take for them. After his death,\r\nwhich occurred at Brighton on the 7th of June 1887, the remainder of his\r\nlibrary was disposed of in two sales by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and\r\nHodge: the first on June 18th, 1888, and the eleven following days, and\r\nthe second on November 23rd, 1888, and the thirteen following days. They\r\nrealised respectively thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy\r\npounds, thirteen shillings, and two thousand eight hundred and\r\nseventy-four pounds, seventeen shillings and sixpence. The prices\r\nobtained for the books, especially at the French sale, were very high. A\r\ndedication copy to Mademoiselle de Montpensier, with the signature of\r\nCharles de Lorraine on the title-page, of _Recueil des Portraits et\r\nEloges en vers et en prose (de personnages du temps par Mademoiselle de\r\nMontpensier et autres)_, Paris, 1659, with a morocco binding of the\r\nseventeenth century, ornamented with _fleurs-de-lis_, fetched fourteen\r\nthousand francs; La Fontaine's _Fables Choisies_, five volumes, Paris,\r\n1678, 1679 and 1694, bound by Boyet, eleven thousand nine hundred and\r\nfifty francs; _Les Fais de Jason_, par Raoul Le Febvre, printed at Lyons\r\nabout 1480, seven thousand six hundred francs; _Le Livre appelle\r\nMandeville_, Lyon, 1480, six thousand two hundred and fifty francs; _Les\r\nOEuvres de Guillaume Coquillant_, Paris, 1532, five thousand four\r\nhundred and fifty francs; and _Les OEuvres de Moliere_, eight volumes,\r\nParis, 1739, with additional plates, five thousand francs. Among the\r\nbooks at the English sales the exceptionally fine and large copies of\r\nthe _Tewrdannck_, Nuremberg, 1517, and the Aldine _Poliphili\r\nHypnerotomachia_, sold respectively for two hundred and fifty pounds and\r\none hundred and thirty-seven pounds; a copy of _Paesi Novamente\r\nRetrovati_, Vicentia, 1507, with the title in facsimile, for one hundred\r\nand eighty-six pounds; and Shakespeare's _Poems_, 1640, for one hundred\r\nand six pounds. The first folio of Shakespeare Mr. Turner sold privately\r\nto an American collector. A Grolier binding realised three thousand\r\nfrancs; another binding with the devices of Diana of Poitiers, four\r\nthousand four hundred francs; a book from the library of Longepierre,\r\ntwo thousand five hundred francs; two sets of volumes with _doublures_\r\nby Boyet, respectively four thousand francs and three thousand nine\r\nhundred francs; and Rogers's _Italy and Poems_, with beautiful bindings\r\nby Bedford, sixty-one pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Turner was an accomplished linguist, and he possessed a wide and\r\naccurate knowledge of the literary history and bibliography of France,\r\nItaly and Spain. He was also a collector of rare and beautiful bindings\r\nbefore the interest and value of these works of art were generally\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK LOCKER-LAMPSON, 1821-1895\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. LOCKER LAMPSON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Frederick Locker, the author of _London Lyrics_ and other volumes of\r\ndelightful light and social verse, was born in 1821. His father was Mr.\r\nE.H. Locker, a Civil Commissioner of Greenwich Hospital, and founder of\r\nthe Naval Gallery there. For some years Mr. Locker was Precis Writer in\r\nthe Admiralty. He was twice married: first in 1850 to Lady Charlotte\r\nChristian, a daughter of the seventh Earl of Elgin, and secondly in 1874\r\nto Hannah Jane, a daughter of the late Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson,\r\nBart., of Rowfant, Sussex. On the death of his father-in-law in 1885 he\r\nadded the name of Lampson to his own. He died at Rowfant on May the\r\n30th, 1895.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF MR. LOCKER-LAMPSON'S BOOK-PLATES.]\r\n\r\nMr. Locker-Lampson tells us in his interesting autobiography entitled\r\n_My Confidences_, that he first collected pictures and rare sixteenth\r\ncentury engravings, but collectors with long purses outbid him, so he\r\nturned to old books: 'little volumes of poetry and the drama from about\r\n1590 to 1610.' These formed the nucleus of his collection, which soon\r\ngrew wide enough to include Caxtons and the works of the poets of the\r\nlast century. Rare editions of Sidney, Spenser, Churchyard, Middleton,\r\nHerbert, Herrick, Dekker, Chapman, and many other writers of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are to be found in it, and\r\nShakespeare is splendidly represented by a perfect copy of the first\r\nfolio, the first editions of _Lucrece_, the _Sonnets_ and the _Poems_,\r\nand a large number--some thirty in all--of the quarto plays, many of\r\nwhich are the original editions. Mr. Locker-Lampson's folio wanted Ben\r\nJonson's verses, and he gives an amusing account in _My Confidences_ of\r\nan unsuccessful attempt to purchase a copy of them from a Mr. Dene, who\r\npossessed an imperfect first folio. He ultimately bought the precious\r\nleaf, which had been pasted in a scrap-book, for one hundred pounds, and\r\nso completed his copy. The library is also very rich in first editions\r\nof Byron, Tennyson, Browning, and other English poets of recent times,\r\nmany of the volumes containing autograph inscriptions to Mr.\r\nLocker-Lampson himself. Mr. Locker-Lampson placed his library, together\r\nwith his collections of autograph letters, pictures and drawings, in his\r\nresidence at Rowfant, the beautiful home which he and his wife\r\ninherited from the lady's father; and a handsome catalogue of them\r\npublished in 1886 by Mr. Quaritch, with an introduction by their owner,\r\ntells us of the treasures they contain. An etched portrait of Mr.\r\nLocker-Lampson and a sketch of his study are inserted in the volume, and\r\nMr. Andrew Lang has prefixed some charming lines descriptive of the\r\nlibrary:--\r\n\r\n  'The Rowfant books, how fair they show,\r\n    The Quarto quaint, the Aldine tall;\r\n  Print, autograph, Portfolio!\r\n    Back from the outer air they call\r\n  The athletes from the Tennis ball,\r\n    The Rhymer from his rod and hooks;\r\n  Would I could sing them, one and all,\r\n    The Rowfant books!\r\n\r\n  The Rowfant books! In sun and snow\r\n    They're dear, but most when tempests fall;\r\n  The folio towers above the row\r\n    As once, o'er minor prophets--Saul!\r\n  What jolly jest books, and what small\r\n    \"Dear dumpy Twelves\" to fill the nooks.\r\n  You do not find in every stall\r\n    The Rowfant books!\r\n\r\n  The Rowfant books! These long ago\r\n    Were chained within some College hall;\r\n  These manuscripts retain the glow\r\n    Of many a coloured capital;\r\n  While yet the Satires keep their gall,\r\n    While the _Pastissier_ puzzles cooks,\r\n  There is a joy that does not pall,\r\n    The Rowfant books!\r\n\r\n  ENVOY.\r\n\r\n  The Rowfant books,--ah magical\r\n    As famed Armida's golden looks.\r\n  They hold the Rhymer for their thrall--\r\n    The Rowfant books!'\r\n\r\nIn 1900 was published an Appendix to the Catalogue, the work of Mr.\r\nFrederick Locker-Lampson's son, Mr. Godfrey Locker-Lampson, consisting\r\nof additions to the library since the printing of the Catalogue in 1886,\r\nto which Mr. Andrew Lang again contributed some verses:--\r\n\r\n  'How often to the worthy Sire\r\n    Succeeds th' unworthy son!\r\n  Extinguished is the ancient fire,\r\n  Books were the idols of the Squire,\r\n    The graceless heir has none.\r\n\r\n  To Sotheby's go both old and new,\r\n    Bindings, and prose, and rhymes,\r\n  With Shakespeare as with Padeloup\r\n  The sportive lord has naught to do,\r\n    _He_ reads _The Sporting Times_.\r\n\r\n  Behold a special act of grace,\r\n    On Rowfant shelves behold,\r\n  The well-loved honours keep their place,\r\n  And new-won glories half efface\r\n    The splendours of the old.'\r\n\r\nThe volume also contains verses by Mr. Austin Dobson, the Earl of Crewe,\r\nand Mr. Wilfrid Blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MORRIS, 1834-1896\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Morris, the poet, art-designer, and manufacturer, was born at\r\nElm House, Clay Hill, Walthamstow, Essex, on the 24th of March 1834. His\r\nfather William Morris, a partner in the firm of Sanderson and Co.,\r\ndiscount brokers, London, died in 1847, leaving him a considerable\r\nfortune. Young Morris was first educated at a preparatory school at\r\nWalthamstow, and afterwards at Marlborough, from whence he proceeded to\r\nExeter College, Oxford. On leaving the University he wished to become a\r\npainter, but his studies were not sufficiently successful to warrant him\r\ncarrying out his intention. He also paid some attention to the study of\r\narchitecture. In 1858 he published a small volume entitled _The Defence\r\nof Guenevere and other Poems_, which received but little notice at the\r\ntime; but _The Life and Death of Jason_, published in 1867, attracted\r\ngeneral attention, and his reputation was further greatly increased by\r\n_The Earthly Paradise_, a poem in four volumes, which appeared in\r\n1868-70. From that period until the time of his death Mr. Morris\r\npublished a considerable number of other works, and, in collaboration\r\nwith Mr. Eirikr Magnusson, some translations from the Icelandic. In\r\n1863, in conjunction with D.G. Rossetti, E. Burne-Jones, and Ford Madox\r\nBrown, he established a factory for the production of artistic glass,\r\ntiles, wall-paper, etc., which has greatly contributed to the\r\nimprovement of household decoration in England. A large number of the\r\ndesigns were the work of Mr. Morris himself, his leisure hours being\r\ndevoted to literature, and it has been said of him 'that his poems were\r\nby Morris the wall-paper maker, and his wall-papers by Morris the poet.'\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Morris established a printing-press near his residence,\r\nKelmscott House, on the Upper Mall, Hammersmith, from which he issued a\r\nseries of beautiful and sumptuous reprints, principally of old books,\r\nwith ornamentations by himself, and illustrations chiefly by Sir E.\r\nBurne-Jones. Of these reprints, which at the present time fetch large\r\nprices, that of _Chaucer's Poems_ is considered the finest. In 1898 the\r\ntrustees of Mr. Morris published 'A Note on his aims in founding the\r\nKelmscott Press. Together with a short description of the Press by C.S.\r\nCockerell, and an annotated list of the books printed thereat.' The list\r\ngives fifty-three works in sixty-three volumes and nine leaflets. This\r\nwas the last book printed at the Kelmscott Press. It was finished at No.\r\n14 Upper Mall, Hammersmith, on the 4th of March 1898. In it the aims of\r\nMorris in founding the Press are given in his own words. 'I began\r\nprinting books,' he writes, 'with the hope of producing some which would\r\nhave a definite claim to beauty, while at the same time they should be\r\neasy to read, and should not dazzle the eye, or trouble the intellect of\r\nthe reader by eccentricity of form in the letters.' Mr. Morris, who died\r\nat Kelmscott House on the 3rd of October 1896, collected a fine and\r\nextensive library, which passed into the hands of a Manchester collector\r\nfor, it is said, the sum of twenty thousand pounds. The purchaser, after\r\nselecting the books he required--about half of the MSS. and one-third of\r\nthe printed books--sent the others to Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, by\r\nwhom they were sold on December 5th, 1898, and five following days.\r\nThere were twelve hundred and fifteen lots in the sale, and the sum\r\nobtained for them was ten thousand nine hundred and ninety-two pounds,\r\neleven shillings. All the books realised good prices, but the\r\nmanuscripts were of greater interest and value than the printed volumes.\r\nThe following are a few of the principal manuscripts, and the prices\r\nthey fetched:--_Testamentum Novum Latinum_, Saec. xii., vellum,\r\nhandsomely illuminated, two hundred and twenty-five pounds; Hegesippus,\r\n_De Excidio Judaeorum_, Saec. xii., vellum, in the original Winchester\r\nbinding, one hundred and eighty pounds; _Biblia Sacra Latina_, written\r\non vellum about 1280, with handsomely painted initials, one hundred and\r\nthirty-nine pounds; _Biblia Sacra Latina_, vellum, written about 1300\r\nby an Anglo-Norman scribe, with finely illuminated initials, three\r\nhundred and two pounds; _Josephi Antiquitates Judaicae et de Bello\r\nJudaico Libri_, written on vellum by a French scribe in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and beautifully illuminated, three hundred and five pounds;\r\n_Missale Anglicanum_, called the Sherbrooke Missal on account of it\r\nhaving belonged to the Sherbrooke family of Oxton, County Notts, a\r\nmember of the family having inscribed his name in it about 1600; it was\r\nwritten in the fourteenth century on vellum, and has illuminated\r\ncapitals and fine marginal decorations, three hundred and fifty pounds;\r\nGratianus, _Decretales_, Saec. xiv., vellum, with finely painted and\r\nilluminated initials, two hundred and fifty-five pounds; Virgilius Maro,\r\n_Georgica et AEneis_, written on vellum at the end of the fourteenth or\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century by an Italian scribe, with beautiful\r\nilluminated decorations, one hundred and sixty-four pounds; and _Legenda\r\nSanctae Catherinae de Senis_, Saec. xv., vellum, handsomely illuminated,\r\none hundred and forty-nine pounds.\r\n\r\nSome of the more notable printed books were:--_S. Hieronymi Epistolae_,\r\nprinted by Sweynheym and Pannartz at Rome in 1468, fifty-three pounds;\r\n_Speculum Humanae Salvationis Latino-Germanicum_, printed by G. Zainer at\r\nAugsburg about 1471, one hundred pounds; _Ptolomaei Cosmographia_, Ulmae,\r\n1486, ninety-one pounds; _Dives and Pauper_, printed by Pynson in 1493,\r\nfifty-five pounds; Higden's _Policronicon_, 1495, _Thordinary of Crysten\r\nMen_, 1502, and _The Orcharde of Syon_, 1519, all from the press of\r\nWynkyn de Worde, realised respectively thirty-eight pounds, fifty\r\npounds, and one hundred and fifty-one pounds; _Hystoire du Chevallier\r\nPerceval le Galloys_, Paris, 1530, seventy-nine pounds; _Epistole et\r\nEvangelii et Letioni Vulgari in lingua Thoscana_, Firenze, 1551,\r\neighty-nine pounds; and the _Historie of the four Sonnes of Aimon_,\r\nprinted by William Copland in 1554, eighty-one pounds. Among the\r\nmanuscripts retained were a twelfth-century English Bestiary, for which\r\nMr. Morris gave nine hundred pounds; the 'Windmill' Psalter, written\r\nabout 1270, which cost him upwards of a thousand pounds; the Huntingdon\r\nPsalter, and the Tiptoft Missal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF SALES\r\n\r\nBY WALTER STANLEY GRAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nABBREVIATIONS.\r\n\r\n  B.
