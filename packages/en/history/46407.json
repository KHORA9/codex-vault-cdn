He was himself present at the arrangement of these papers. Among\r\nthem was found the celebrated letter of Alexis Orloff,[1] in which, in a\r\ncynical tone and with a drunken hand, he announced to the Empress the\r\nassassination of her husband Peter III. There was also a manuscript,\r\nwritten entirely by the hand of Catherine herself, and enclosed in a\r\nsealed envelope, bearing this inscription:--\"_To his Imperial Highness,\r\nthe Cesarewitch and Grand Duke Paul, my beloved son._\" Under this\r\nenvelope was the manuscript of the Memoirs which we now publish.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript terminates abruptly towards the close of the year 1759.\r\nIt is said that there were with it some detached notes, which would have\r\nserved as materials for its continuation. Some persons affirm that Paul\r\nthrew these into the fire; but nothing certain is known upon this point.\r\nPaul kept his mother's manuscript a great secret, and never entrusted\r\nit to any one but the friend of his childhood Prince Alexander\r\nKourakine. The Prince took a copy of it. Some twenty years after the\r\ndeath of Paul, Alexander Tourgeneff and Prince Michael Worontzoff\r\nobtained copies from the transcript of Kourakine. The Emperor Nicholas\r\nhaving heard of this, gave orders to the Secret Police to seize all the\r\ncopies. Amongst them was one written at Odessa, by the hand of the\r\ncelebrated poet Pouschkine. A complete stop was now put to the further\r\ncirculation of the Memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Nicholas had the original brought to him by the Count D.\r\nBloudoff, read it, sealed it with the great seal of state, and ordered\r\nit to be kept in the imperial archives, among the most secret documents.\r\n\r\nTo these details, which I extract from a notice communicated to me, I\r\nought to add that the first person who spoke to me on the subject was\r\nConstantine Arsenieff, the preceptor of the present Emperor. He told me,\r\nin 1840, that he had obtained permission to read many secret documents\r\nrelative to the events which followed the death of Peter I, up to the\r\nreign of Alexander I. Among these documents, he was authorized to read\r\nthe Memoirs of Catherine II. (At that time he was teaching the Modern\r\nHistory of Russia to the Grand Duke, the heir presumptive.)\r\n\r\nDuring the Crimean war, the archives were transferred to Moscow. In the\r\nmonth of March, 1855, the present Emperor had the manuscript brought to\r\nhim to read. Since that period one or two copies have again circulated\r\nat Moscow and St. Petersburg. It is from one of these that we now\r\npublish the Memoirs. As to their authenticity, there is not the least\r\nroom for doubt. Besides, it is only necessary to read two or three pages\r\nof the text to be quite satisfied on the point.\r\n\r\nWe have abstained from all corrections of the style, in every case in\r\nwhich it was not evident that the copy presented some fault of\r\ntranscription.\r\n\r\nPassing to the Memoirs themselves, what do we find?\r\n\r\nThe early years of Catherine II--of that woman-Emperor, who occupied for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century all contemporary minds, from Voltaire\r\nand Frederic II to the Khan of the Crimea and the Chiefs of the\r\nKirghis--_her young days described by herself!_ ... What is there for\r\nthe Editor to add to this?\r\n\r\nIn reading these pages, we behold her entering on the scene, we see her\r\nforming herself to that which she afterwards became. A frolicsome girl\r\nof fourteen, her head dressed \"_à la Moïse_,\" fair, playful, betrothed\r\nof a little idiot, the Grand Duke, she has already caught the disease of\r\nthe Winter Palace--the thirst of dominion. One day, while \"perched\" with\r\nthe Grand Duke upon a window-sill, and joking with him, she saw Count\r\nLestocq enter: \"Pack up your things,\" he said, \"you are off for\r\nGermany.\" The young idiot seemed but little affected by the threatened\r\nseparation. \"It was pretty nearly a matter of indifference to me also,\"\r\nsays the little German girl; \"_but the Crown of Russia was not so_,\"\r\nadds the Grand Duchess.\r\n\r\nHere we have, in the bud, the Catherine of 1762!\r\n\r\nTo dream of the crown, however, was quite natural in the atmosphere of\r\nthat court; natural not only for the betrothed of the Heir Presumptive,\r\nbut for every one. The groom Biren, the singer Rasoumowsky, the Prince\r\nDolgorouky, the plebeian Menchikoff, the oligarch Volynski--every one\r\nwas anxious for a shred of the imperial mantle. The crown of Russia,\r\nafter Peter I, was a _res nullius_.\r\n\r\nPeter I, a terrorist and reformer, before all things, had no respect for\r\nlegitimacy. His absolutism sought to reach even beyond the tomb. He gave\r\nhimself the right of appointing his successor, and instead of appointing\r\nhim, he contented himself with ordering the assassination of his own\r\nson.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Peter, the nobles assembled for deliberation.\r\nMenchikoff put a stop to all discussion, and proclaimed as empress his\r\nold mistress, the widow of a brave Swedish dragoon, slain upon the field\r\nof battle, the widow of Peter also, to whom Menchikoff had resigned her\r\n\"through devotion\" to his master.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Catherine I was short. After her the crown passed from head\r\nto head as chance directed: from the once Livonian tavern-keeper, to a\r\nstreet-boy (Peter II); from this street-boy who died of small-pox, to\r\nthe Duchess of Courland (Anne); from the Duchess of Courland to a\r\nPrincess of Mecklenburg (wife of a Prince of Brunswick), who reigned in\r\nthe name of an infant in the cradle (Ivan); from this boy, born _too\r\nlate_ to reign, the crown passed to the head of a woman born _too\r\nsoon_--Elizabeth. She it is who represents legitimacy.\r\n\r\nTradition broken, the people and the state completely separated by the\r\nreforms of Peter I, _coups d'état_ and palace revolutions were the order\r\nof the day; nothing was fixed. The inhabitants of St. Petersburg, when\r\nretiring at night, knew not under whose government they should awake in\r\nthe morning; they consequently took but little interest in changes,\r\nwhich, after all, did not essentially concern any but a few German\r\nintriguers, become Russian ministers, a few great nobles grown gray in\r\nperjury and crime, and the regiment of Preobrajensky, which disposed of\r\nthe crown like the Pretorians of old. For all others, everything\r\nremained unchanged. And when I say others, I speak only of the nobles\r\nand officials; for as to the great silent people--that people prostrate,\r\nsad, stupefied, dumb--it was never thought of. The people was beyond the\r\npale of the law, and passively accepted the terrible trial which God had\r\nsent it, caring little for the spectres which mounted with tottering\r\nsteps the ascent to the throne; gliding like shadows, and disappearing\r\nin Siberia, or in the dungeons. The people was sure to be pillaged in\r\nany case. Its social condition therefore was beyond the reach of\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange period! The imperial throne, as we have elsewhere\r\nsaid,[2] was like the bed of Cleopatra. A crowd of oligarchs, of\r\nstrangers, of panders, of minions, led forth nightly an unknown, a\r\nchild, a German; placed the puppet on the throne, worshipped it, and, in\r\nits name, gave the knout to all who presumed to question the\r\narrangement. Scarcely had the chosen one time to become intoxicated with\r\nthe delights of an exorbitant and absurd power, and to condemn his\r\nenemies to slavery or torture, when the succeeding wave raised up\r\nanother pretender, and the chosen of yesterday, with all his followers,\r\nwas ingulphed in the abyss. The ministers and generals of one day, were\r\nthe next on their way to Siberia, loaded with chains.\r\n\r\nThis _bufera infernale_ carried away people with such rapidity, that\r\nthere was not time to get accustomed to their faces. Marshal Munich, who\r\nhad overturned Biren, rejoined him on a raft, stopped upon the Volga,\r\nhimself a prisoner, with chains on his feet. It is in the struggle of\r\nthese two Germans, who disputed the empire of Russia as if it had been a\r\njug of beer, that we may retrace the true type of the _coups d'état_ of\r\nthe good old times.\r\n\r\nThe Empress Anne died, leaving the crown, as we have just said, to a\r\nchild only a few months old, under the Regency of her lover Biren. The\r\nDuke of Courland was all-powerful. Despising everything Russian, he\r\nwished to civilize us with the lash. In the hope of strengthening\r\nhimself, he destroyed with a cold-blooded cruelty hundreds of men, and\r\ndrove into exile more than twenty thousand. Marshal Munich got tired of\r\nthis; he was a German as well as Biren, and besides a good soldier. One\r\nday, the Princess of Brunswick, the mother of the little Emperor,\r\ncomplained to him of the arrogance of Biren. \"Have you spoken on this\r\nsubject to any one else?\" asked the Marshal. \"I have not.\" \"Very well,\r\nthen; keep silent, and leave everything to me.\" This was on the 7th of\r\nSeptember, 1740.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th, Munich dined with Biren. After dinner he left his family\r\nwith the Regent, and retired for a moment. Going quietly to the\r\nresidence of the Princess of Brunswick, he told her to be prepared for\r\nthe night, and then returned. Supper came on. Munich gave anecdotes of\r\nhis campaigns, and of the battles he had gained. \"Have you made any\r\nnocturnal expeditions?\" asked the Count de Loewenhaupt. \"I have made\r\nexpeditions at all hours,\" replied the Marshal, with some annoyance. The\r\nRegent, who was indisposed, and was lying on a sofa, sat up at these\r\nwords, and became thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThey parted friends.\r\n\r\nHaving reached home, Munich ordered his aide-de-camp, Manstein, to be\r\nready by two o'clock. At that hour they entered a carriage, and drove\r\nstraight to the Winter Palace. There he had the Princess awakened. \"What\r\nis the matter?\" said the good German, Anthony Ulrich, of\r\nBraunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, to his wife. \"I am not well,\" replied the\r\nPrincess.--And Anthony Ulrich turned over and slept like a top.\r\n\r\nWhile he slept, the Princess drest herself, and the old warrior\r\nconferred with the most turbulent of the soldiers in the Preobrajensky\r\nregiment. He represented to them the humiliating position of the\r\nPrincess, spoke of her future gratitude, and as he spoke, bade them load\r\ntheir muskets.\r\n\r\nThen leaving the Princess under the guard of some _forty_ grenadiers, he\r\nproceeded with _eighty_ others to arrest the chief of the state, the\r\nterrible Duke of Courland.\r\n\r\nThey traversed without impediment the streets of St. Petersburg; reached\r\nthe palace of the Regent; entered it; and Munich sent Manstein to arrest\r\nthe Duke in his bed-chamber, living or dead. The officers on duty, the\r\nsentinels, and the servants looked on. \"Had there been a single officer\r\nor soldier faithful,\" says Manstein, in his memoirs, \"we were lost.\" But\r\nthere was not one. Biren, perceiving the soldiers, endeavoured to escape\r\nby creeping under the bed. Manstein had him forced out: Biren defended\r\nhimself. He received some blows from the butt-ends of their muskets, and\r\nwas then conveyed to the guard-house.\r\n\r\nThe _coup d'état_ was accomplished. But something stranger still was\r\nsoon to follow.\r\n\r\nBiren was detested; that might explain his fall. The new Regent, on the\r\ncontrary--a good and gentle creature, who gave umbrage to no one while\r\nshe gave much love to the Ambassador Linar--was even liked a little\r\nfrom hatred to Biren. A year passed. All was tranquil. But the court of\r\nFrance was dissatisfied with an Austro-Russian alliance which the Regent\r\nhad just concluded with Maria Theresa. How was this alliance to be\r\nprevented? Nothing easier. It was only to make a _coup d'état_, and\r\nexpel the Regent. In this case, we have not even a marshal reverenced by\r\nthe soldiers, not even a statesman. An intriguing physician, Lestocq,\r\nand an intriguing ambassador, La Chétardie, are sufficient to carry to\r\nthe throne, Elizabeth, daughter of Peter I.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, absorbed in pleasures and petty intrigues, little thought of\r\noverturning the government. She was led to believe that the Regent\r\nintended to shut her up in a convent. She, Elizabeth, who spent her time\r\nin the barracks of the guards, and in licentious excesses ... better\r\nmake herself Empress! So also thought La Chétardie; and he did more than\r\nthink; he gave French gold to hire a handful of soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of November, 1741, the Grand Duchess, dressed in a\r\nmagnificent robe, and with a brilliant cuirass on her breast, presented\r\nherself at the guard-house of the Preobrajensky regiment. She exposed to\r\nthe soldiers her unhappy condition. They, reeking with wine, cried out,\r\n\"Command, mother, command, and we will slaughter them all!\" The\r\ncharitable Grand Duchess recoils with horror, and _only_ orders the\r\narrest of the Regent, her husband, and their son--the _baby_-Emperor.\r\n\r\nOnce again is the old scene repeated.\r\n\r\nAnthony Ulrich, of Braunschweig, is awakened from the most profound\r\nslumber; but this time he cannot relapse into it again, for two soldiers\r\nwrap him up in a sheet and carry him to a dungeon, which he will leave\r\nonly to go and die in exile.\r\n\r\nAgain is the _coup d'état_ accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe new reign seems to go on wheels. And once more nothing is wanting to\r\nthis strange crown ... but an heir. The Empress who will have nothing to\r\ndo with the little Ivan, seeks one in the Episcopal palace of the\r\nPrince-Bishop of Lubeck. It is the nephew of the Bishop whom she\r\nselects, a grandson of Peter I, an orphan without father or mother, and\r\nthe intended husband of the little Sophia Augusta Frederica, Princess of\r\nAnhalt-Zerbst-Bernburg, who resigned all these sonorous and illustrious\r\ntitles to be called simply ... _Catherine II_.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after all that has been said, let the reader picture to himself\r\nwhat must have been the nature of the medium into which destiny had cast\r\nthis young girl, gifted, as she was, not only with great talent, but\r\nalso with a character pliant, though full of pride and passion.\r\n\r\nHer position at St. Petersburg was horrible. On one side was her mother,\r\na peevish, scolding, greedy, niggardly, pedantic German, boxing her\r\nears, and taking away her new dresses to appropriate them to her own\r\nuse; on the other, the Empress Elizabeth, a coarse and grumbling\r\nvirago, never quite sober, jealous, envious, causing every step of the\r\nyoung Princess to be watched, every word reported, taking offence at\r\neverything, and all this after having given her for a husband the most\r\nridiculous Benedict of the age.\r\n\r\nA prisoner in the palace, she could do nothing without permission. If\r\nshe wept for the death of her father, the Empress sent her word that she\r\nhad grieved enough. \"That her father was not a king, that she should\r\nmourn him longer than a week.\" If she evinced a friendship for any of\r\nher maids of honour, she might be sure the lady would be dismissed. If\r\nshe became attached to a faithful servant, still more certain was it\r\nthat that servant would be turned away.\r\n\r\nHer relations with the Grand Duke were monstrous, degrading. He made her\r\nthe confidante of his amorous intrigues. Drunk from the age of ten, he\r\ncame one night in liquor to entertain his wife with a description of the\r\ngraces and charms of the daughter of Biren; and as Catherine pretended\r\nto be asleep, he gave her a punch with his fist to awaken her. This\r\nbooby kept a kennel of dogs, which infested the air, at the side of his\r\nwife's bed-chamber, and hung rats in his own, to punish them according\r\nto the rules of martial law.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. After having wounded and outraged nearly every feeling\r\nof this young creature's nature, they began to deprave her\r\nsystematically. The Empress regards as a breach of order her having no\r\nchildren. Madame Tchoglokoff speaks to her on the subject, insinuating\r\nthat, _for the good of the state_, she ought to sacrifice her scruples,\r\nand concludes by proposing to her a choice between Soltikoff and\r\nNarichkine. The young lady affects simplicity and takes both--nay,\r\nPoniatowsky into the bargain, and thus was commenced a career of\r\nlicentiousness in which she never halted during the space of forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhat renders the present publication of serious consequence to the\r\nimperial house of Russia is, that it proves not only that this house\r\ndoes not belong to the family of Romanoff, but that it does not even\r\nbelong to that of Holstein Gottorp. The avowal of Catherine on this\r\npoint is very explicit--_the father of the Emperor Paul is Sergius\r\nSoltikoff_.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Dictatorship of Russia endeavours in vain to represent\r\nitself as traditional and secular.\r\n\r\nOne word before I close.\r\n\r\nIn perusing these Memoirs, the reader is astonished to find one thing\r\nconstantly lost sight of, even to the extent of not appearing\r\nanywhere--it is _Russia and the People_. And here is the characteristic\r\ntrait of the epoch.\r\n\r\nThe Winter Palace, with its military and administrative machinery, was a\r\nworld of its own. Like a ship floating on the surface of the ocean, it\r\nhad no real connection with the inhabitants of the deep, beyond that of\r\neating them. It was the _State for the State_. Organized on the German\r\nmodel, it imposed itself on the nation as a conqueror. In that monstrous\r\nbarrack, in that enormous chancery, there reigned the cold rigidity of\r\na camp. One set gave or transmitted orders, the rest obeyed in silence.\r\nThere was but one single spot within that dreary pile in which human\r\npassions reappeared, agitated and stormy, and that spot was the domestic\r\nhearth; not that of the nation--but of the state. Behind that triple\r\nline of sentinels, in those heavily ornamented saloons, there fermented\r\na feverish life, with its intrigues and its conflicts, its dramas and\r\nits tragedies. It was there that the destinies of Russia were woven, in\r\nthe gloom of the alcove, in the midst of orgies, _beyond_ the reach of\r\ninformers and of the police.\r\n\r\nWhat interest, then, could the young German Princess take in that\r\n_magnum ignotum_, that people _unexpressed_, poor, semi-barbarous, which\r\nconcealed itself in its villages, behind the snow, behind bad roads, and\r\nonly appeared in the streets of St. Petersburg like a foreign outcast,\r\nwith its persecuted beard, and prohibited dress--tolerated only through\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nIt was only long afterwards that Catherine heard the Russian people\r\nseriously spoken of, when the Cossack Pougatcheff, at the head of an\r\narmy of insurgent peasants, menaced Moscow.\r\n\r\nWhen Pougatcheff was vanquished, the Winter Palace again forgot the\r\npeople. And there is no telling when it would have been again remembered\r\nhad it not itself put its masters in mind of its existence, by rising in\r\nmass in 1812, rejecting, on the one hand, the release from serfdom\r\noffered to it at the point of foreign bayonets, and, on the other,\r\nmarching to death to save a country which gave it nothing but slavery,\r\ndegradation, misery--and the oblivion of the Winter Palace.\r\n\r\nThis was the second _memento_ of the Russian people. Let us hope that at\r\nthe third it will be remembered a little longer.\r\n\r\nA. HERZEN.\r\n\r\nLONDON, _November 15th, 1858_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MEMOIRS\r\n\r\n                                OF THE\r\n\r\n                         EMPRESS CATHERINE II.\r\n\r\n                          WRITTEN BY HERSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM 1729, THE YEAR OF HER BIRTH, TO 1751.\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune is not so blind as people think. Her movements are often the\r\nresult of precise and well-planned measures, which escape the perception\r\nof common minds; still oftener are they the result of personal\r\nqualities, character, and conduct.\r\n\r\nTo render this more evident, I will propose the following syllogism:\r\n\r\nQualities and character shall form the major\r\n\r\nConduct, the minor;\r\n\r\nGood or evil fortune, the conclusion.\r\n\r\nHere are two striking illustrations:\r\n\r\n    PETER III.\r\n    CATHERINE II.\r\n    PETER III, HIS FATHER AND MOTHER.\r\n\r\nThe mother of Peter III was a daughter of Peter I. Two months after the\r\nbirth of her son she died of consumption, in the little town of Kiel, in\r\nHolstein, a victim to grief at finding herself established in such a\r\nplace and married so badly. Charles Frederic, Duke of Holstein, nephew\r\nof Charles XII, King of Sweden, was the father of Peter III. He was a\r\nweak prince, ugly, little, sickly, and poor (see the Journal of\r\nBerkholz, in Busching's Magazine). He died in 1739, leaving his son, not\r\nquite eleven years old, under the guardianship of his cousin, Adolphus\r\nFrederic, Bishop of Lubeck and Duke of Holstein, since elected King of\r\nSweden, in consequence of the peace of Abo, and the recommendation of\r\nthe Empress Elizabeth. The education of Peter III was placed under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Grand Marshal of his Court, Brummer, a Swede by\r\nbirth, under whom were the Great Chamberlain Berkholz, author of the\r\njournal just alluded to, and four chamberlains, two of whom, Adlerfeldt,\r\nauthor of a history of Charles XII, and Wachmeister, were Swedes, and\r\nthe other two, Wolff and Madfeldt, natives of Holstein. The Prince was\r\neducated for the throne of Sweden, in a court too large for the country\r\nwhich contained it; and this court was divided into several factions\r\nmutually hating each other, each seeking to obtain an ascendancy over\r\nthe mind of the Prince, instead of endeavouring to form his character,\r\nand all bent upon inspiring him with an aversion for those opposed to\r\nthem. The young Prince cordially hated Brummer; nor did he like any of\r\nhis attendants, because they kept him under restraint.\r\n\r\nEven from the ago of ten, Peter III showed a fondness for drink. He had\r\nto submit to numerous presentations, and was never out of sight night or\r\nday. The persons he most liked during his childhood and the first years\r\nof his residence in Russia were two old valets de chambre--Cramer, a\r\nLivonian, and Roumberg, a Swede. The latter was the favourite; he was a\r\nsomewhat rough and vulgar person, who had been a dragoon under Charles\r\nXII. Brummer, and consequently Berkholz, who only saw with the eyes of\r\nBrummer, was attached to the Prince Guardian and Administrator; all the\r\nrest were dissatisfied with this Prince, and still more so with his\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nWhen the Empress Elizabeth ascended the throne of Russia, she sent the\r\nChamberlain Korf into Holstein to demand her nephew. In consequence, the\r\nPrince Administrator immediately sent him off, accompanied by the Grand\r\nMarshal Brummer, the Chamberlain Berkholz, and the Chamberlain Decken,\r\nnephew of the former. The Empress received the Prince with great joy,\r\nand soon after his arrival set out for Moscow to be crowned. She had\r\ndetermined to declare him her heir; but, first of all, it was\r\nindispensable that he should be received into the Greek church. The\r\nenemies of the Grand Marshal Brummer, and particularly the Great\r\nChamberlain Count Bestoujeff and the Count M. Panin, who was for a long\r\ntime Russian minister in Sweden, pretended to have in their possession\r\nconvincing proofs that Brummer, from the moment he found the Empress\r\ndetermined to declare her nephew heir presumptive to her throne, took as\r\nmuch pains to corrupt the mind and heart of his pupil as he had before\r\ntaken to render him worthy of the crown of Sweden. But I have always\r\ndoubted this atrocity, and looked upon the education of Peter III as a\r\nconflict of unfortunate circumstances. I will relate what I have seen\r\nand heard, and even that will explain a great deal.\r\n\r\nI saw Peter III for the first time when he was eleven years old. He was\r\nthen at Eutin with his guardian, the Prince Bishop of Lubeck, some\r\nmonths after the death of his father, the Duke Charles Frederic. The\r\nPrince Bishop had assembled all his family at Eutin, in 1739, in order\r\nto meet his ward. My grandmother, mother of the Prince Bishop, and my\r\nmother, his sister, had come from Hamburg with me. I was then ten years\r\nold. Prince Augustus and the Princess Anne, brother and sister of the\r\nPrince Guardian and Administrator of Holstein, were also there; and it\r\nwas then I heard it stated, in the presence of the assembled family,\r\nthat the young Duke was inclined to drink, his attendants finding it\r\ndifficult to prevent him from getting intoxicated at table; that he was\r\nrestive and impetuous; without affection for those about him, and\r\nespecially disliking Brummer; that, otherwise, he was not wanting in\r\nvivacity, but that he was of a weak and sickly constitution. In point of\r\nfact, his complexion was pale, and he appeared thin and delicate. To\r\nthis child his attendants wished to give the appearance of a complete\r\nman; and for this purpose he was tormented with restraints only\r\ncalculated to teach him falsehood as well in character as in deportment.\r\n\r\nThe little court of Holstein had not long been settled in Russia when an\r\nembassy arrived from Sweden, requesting the Empress to allow her nephew\r\nto be placed on the throne of that kingdom. Elizabeth, however, had\r\nalready announced her intentions by the preliminaries of the peace of\r\nAbo, as previously mentioned; and she replied to the Swedish diet that\r\nshe had declared her nephew heir to the throne of Russia, and that she\r\nadhered to the preliminaries of the peace of Abo, which gave to Sweden,\r\nas heir presumptive to the crown, the Prince Administrator of Holstein.\r\n(This Prince had had an elder brother, to whom the Empress had been\r\naffianced at the death of Peter I. The marriage had not taken place, as\r\nthe Prince died of small-pox a few weeks after the betrothal; but the\r\nEmpress retained much affection for his memory, as she showed by many\r\nmarks of favour to all the family.)\r\n\r\nPeter III, then, was declared heir to Elizabeth and Grand Duke of\r\nRussia, after having previously made his profession of faith according\r\nto the rites of the Greek church. His instructor on this occasion was\r\nSimon Theodorsky, since Archbishop of Pleskov. The Prince had been\r\nbaptized and brought up in the Lutheran creed in its most rigid and\r\nleast tolerant form. He had always been refractory under instruction of\r\nevery kind; and I have heard his attendants say that, while at Kiel,\r\nthey had infinite trouble in getting him to church on Sundays and\r\nholidays, and making him perform the acts of devotion required of him;\r\nand that most of the time he displayed his irreligion in the presence of\r\nSimon Theodorsky. His Royal Highness took it into his head to dispute\r\nupon every point, and his attendants had often to be called in to check\r\nhis ill-humour or impetuosity. At last, after giving a deal of trouble,\r\nhe submitted to the wishes of his aunt the Empress; though, whether from\r\nprejudice, habit, or the spirit of contradiction, he frequently took\r\ncare to let it be seen that he would rather have gone to Sweden than\r\nremain in Russia. He retained Brummer, Berkholz, and his Holstein\r\nattendants until his marriage. Some other masters were added to these as\r\na matter of routine: Mr. Isaac Wesselowsky for the Russian language; he\r\ncame but rarely at first, and finally not at all; the other was the\r\nProfessor Stehlein, who was to teach him mathematics and history, but\r\nwho, in reality, only played with him, and served him as a buffoon. The\r\nperson who was most assiduous was the ballet-master, Laudé, who taught\r\nhim dancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1744.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first, the sole occupation of the Grand Duke, when in his private\r\napartment, was to make the two servants who attended him there to go\r\nthrough the military exercise. He gave them titles and ranks, and then\r\nagain degraded them, according to the whim of the moment. It was truly\r\nchild's play, and a constant childhood. In general, indeed, he was very\r\nchildish, although at this time he was sixteen. In 1744, while the court\r\nwas at Moscow, Catherine II arrived there with her mother, on the 9th of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe Russian court was at that time divided into two great sections or\r\nparties. At the head of the first, which now began to recover from its\r\nprevious depression, was the Vice-Chancellor Count Bestoujeff Rumine. He\r\nwas a man far more feared than loved, excessively intriguing and\r\nsuspicious, firm and resolute in his principles, not a little\r\ntyrannical, an implacable enemy, but a steady friend, never abandoning\r\nthose who did not first turn their backs on him. He was, besides,\r\ndifficult to get along with, and apt to stand upon trifles. He was at\r\nthe head of the department of foreign affairs. Having to contend with\r\nthose immediately about the Empress, he had been kept down before the\r\njourney to Moscow; but now he began to gain an ascendancy. He leaned to\r\nthe court of Vienna, to that of Saxony, and to England. The arrival of\r\nCatherine II and her mother gave him no pleasure; it was the secret\r\nwork of the faction opposed to him. The enemies of the Count were\r\nnumerous, but he made them all tremble. He had over them the advantage\r\nof his position and character, which gave him great weight in the\r\npolitics of the ante-chamber.\r\n\r\nThe party opposed to Bestoujeff were in favour of France, her protégée\r\nSweden, and the king of Prussia. The Marquis de la Chétardie was the\r\nsoul of this party; the courtiers from Holstein its prominent\r\npersonages. They had gained over Lestocq, one of the principal actors in\r\nthe revolution which had placed Elizabeth on the throne of Russia. He\r\nhad a large share in her confidence. He had been her surgeon since the\r\ndeath of the Empress Catherine I, to whose household he had also been\r\nattached, and had rendered essential services to both mother and\r\ndaughter. He was not wanting either in shrewdness, skill, or intrigue;\r\nbut he was malicious, and had a bad heart. All these strangers supported\r\nhim, and put forward Count Michael Woronzoff, who had also taken part in\r\nthe revolution, and had accompanied Elizabeth on the night she ascended\r\nthe throne. She had made him marry the niece of the Empress Catherine I,\r\nthe Countess Anna Karlovna Skavronsky, who had been brought up with\r\nherself, and was very much attached to her. To this faction also\r\nbelonged the Count Alexander Roumianzoff, father of the Marshal, who had\r\nsigned the peace of Abo with Sweden--a peace in which Bestoujeff had\r\nbeen but little consulted. The party also counted upon the\r\nProcurator-general Troubetzkoy, upon the whole Troubetzkoy family, and,\r\nconsequently, upon the Prince of Hesse-Homburg, who had married a\r\nprincess of this family. The Prince of Hesse-Homburg, who was much\r\nthought of at that time, was personally of little consequence, his\r\nimportance being wholly derived from the extensive family to which his\r\nwife belonged, and of which the father and mother were still living: the\r\nlatter enjoyed great consideration.\r\n\r\nThe remaining portion of those who were about the Empress consisted at\r\nthat time of the family of Schouvaloff. These balanced in all respects\r\nthe Master of the Hounds, Razoumowsky, who, for the moment, was the\r\nacknowledged favourite.\r\n\r\nCount Bestoujeff knew how to make these latter useful, but his chief\r\nreliance was on the Baron Tcherkassoff, Secretary of the Cabinet to the\r\nEmpress, and who had previously served in the cabinet of Peter I. He was\r\na rough and headstrong man, an advocate of order and justice, and one\r\nwho wished to see everything in due form and system. The remainder of\r\nthe court took sides with one or other of these parties, according to\r\ntheir several interests or personal feelings.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of my mother and myself seemed to give the Grand Duke much\r\npleasure. I was then in my fifteenth year. During the first few days he\r\nshowed me great attention. Even then, and in that short time, I could\r\nsee that he cared but little for the nation over which he was destined\r\nto rule; that he leaned to Lutheranism; that he had no affection for\r\nthose about him; and that he was very childish. I was silent, and\r\nlistened, and this gained me his confidence. I remember his telling me,\r\namong other things, that what most pleased him in me was, that I was his\r\ncousin, as he could therefore, from our near relationship, open his\r\nheart to me with entire confidence; and hereupon he went on to inform me\r\nthat he was in love with one of the maids of honour to the Empress, who\r\nhad been dismissed from court in consequence of the misfortune of her\r\nmother, a Madame Lapoukine, who had been exiled to Siberia; that he\r\nwould have been very glad to have married her, but that he was resigned\r\nto marry me instead, as his aunt wished it. I listened with a blush to\r\nthese family disclosures, thanking him for his premature confidence;\r\nbut, in reality, I was astounded at his imprudence and utter want of\r\njudgment in a variety of matters.\r\n\r\nThe tenth day after my arrival in Moscow, it was Saturday, the Empress\r\nwent to the convent of Troïtza. The Grand Duke remained with us at\r\nMoscow. Three masters had already been assigned me: Simon Theodorsky, to\r\ninstruct me in the Greek faith; Basil Adadouroff, for the Russian\r\nlanguage; and the ballet-master, Laudé, for dancing. In order to make\r\ngreater progress in the Russian, I used to sit up in bed when every one\r\nelse was asleep, and learned by heart the lessons which Adadouroff had\r\nleft me. As my room was warm, and I had no experience of the climate, I\r\nneglected to put on my shoes or stockings, but studied just as I left my\r\nbed. The consequence was, that from the fifteenth day I was seized with\r\na pleurisy which threatened to kill me. It commenced with a shivering,\r\nwhich seized me on the Tuesday after the departure of the Empress for\r\nthe convent of Troïtza, just as I had dressed for dinner. My mother and\r\nmyself were to dine that day with the Grand Duke, and I had much\r\ndifficulty in getting her to allow me to go to bed. On her return from\r\ndinner, she found me almost without consciousness, in a burning fever,\r\nand with an excruciating pain in the side. She fancied I was going to\r\nhave the small-pox; sent for the physicians, and wished me to be treated\r\nin consequence. The medical men insisted on my being bled, but she would\r\nnot listen to the proposal, saying that it was from being bled that her\r\nbrother had died of the small-pox in Russia, and that she did not wish\r\nme to share the same fate. The physicians, and the attendants of the\r\nGrand Duke, who had not had the disease, sent to the Empress an exact\r\nreport of the state of matters, and in the mean time, while my mother\r\nand the doctors were disputing, I lay in my bed, unconscious, in a\r\nburning fever, and with a pain in the side which occasioned intense\r\nsuffering, and forced from me continual moanings, for which my mother\r\nscolded me, telling me that I ought to bear my sufferings patiently.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the Saturday evening, at seven o'clock, that is, on the\r\nfifth day of my disease, the Empress returned from the convent at\r\nTroïtza, and, on alighting from her carriage, proceeded to my room, and\r\nfound me without consciousness. She had with her Count Lestocq and a\r\nsurgeon, and having heard the opinion of the physicians, she sat down at\r\nthe head of my bed, and ordered me to be bled. The moment the blood\r\ncame, I recovered my consciousness, and, opening my eyes, found myself\r\nin the arms of the Empress, who had lifted me up. For twenty-seven days\r\nI lay between life and death, and during that period I was bled sixteen\r\ntimes, on some occasions as often as four times in the day. My mother\r\nwas scarcely ever allowed to enter my room. She continued opposed to\r\nthese frequent bleedings, and loudly asserted that the doctors were\r\nkilling me. She began, however, to believe that I should not have the\r\nsmall-pox. The Empress had placed the Countess Roumianzoff and several\r\nother ladies in attendance on me, and it seemed that my mother's\r\njudgment was distrusted. At last, under the care of the physician\r\nSanches, a Portuguese, the abscess which had formed in my right side\r\nburst. I vomited it, and from that moment I began to recover. I soon\r\nperceived that my mother's conduct during my illness had lowered her in\r\nevery one's estimation. When she saw me very bad, she wished a Lutheran\r\nclergyman to be brought to me. I have been told that they brought me to\r\nmyself, or took advantage of a moment of returning consciousness, to\r\npropose this to me, and that I replied, \"What is the good? I would\r\nrather have Simon Theodorsky; I will speak to him with pleasure.\" He was\r\nbrought, and addressed me in a manner that gave general satisfaction.\r\nThis occurrence did me great service in the opinion of the Empress and\r\nof the entire court. There was also another circumstance which injured\r\nmy mother. One day, towards Easter, she took it into her head to send me\r\nword by a maid-servant that she wished me to give up to her a piece of\r\nblue and silver stuff, which my father's brother had presented to me on\r\nmy departure for Russia, seeing that I had taken a great fancy for it. I\r\nreplied that she could, of course, take it, though I certainly prized it\r\nvery much, as my uncle had given it to me because I liked it so much.\r\nThe persons about me perceiving that I parted with it unwillingly, and\r\nconsidering how long I had hovered between life and death, having only\r\ngot a little better within the last two or three days, began to complain\r\nof my mother's imprudence in giving any annoyance to a dying child,\r\nsaying, that so far from depriving me of my dress, she ought not even to\r\nhave mentioned the matter. The circumstance was related to the Empress,\r\nwho instantly sent me several superb pieces of stuff, and among them one\r\nof blue and silver, but the circumstance injured my mother in the\r\nestimation of the Empress. She was accused of having no affection for\r\nme, nor any discretion either. I had accustomed myself during my illness\r\nto lie with my eyes closed. I was supposed to be asleep, and then the\r\nCountess Roumianzoff, and the ladies who were with her, spoke their\r\nminds freely, and I thus learned a great many things.\r\n\r\nAs I began to get better, the Grand Duke often came to spend the evening\r\nin my mother's apartment, which was also mine. He and every one else\r\nseemed to take the greatest interest in my condition. The Empress had\r\noften shed tears about me. At last, on the 21st of April, 1744, my\r\nbirthday, whence commenced my fifteenth year, I was able to appear in\r\npublic for the first time after this severe illness.\r\n\r\nI fancy that people were not much edified with the apparition. I was\r\nwasted away to a skeleton. I had grown; but my face and features had\r\nlengthened, my hair had fallen off, and I was deadly pale. To myself I\r\nlooked frightfully ugly; I could not recognize myself. The Empress sent\r\nme, on the occasion, a pot of rouge, and ordered me to use it.\r\n\r\nWith the return of spring and fine weather, the assiduities of the Grand\r\nDuke ceased. He preferred walking and shooting in the environs of\r\nMoscow. Sometimes, however, he came to dine or sup with us, and then he\r\ncontinued his childish confidences to me, while his attendants conversed\r\nwith my mother, who received much company, and with whom many\r\nconferences took place, which did not fail to displease those who were\r\nnot present at them, especially Count Bestoujeff, all whose enemies were\r\nin the habit of assembling with us, and particularly the Marquis de la\r\nChétardie, who had not yet put forth any character[3] from the court of\r\nFrance, though he carried in his pocket his credentials as ambassador.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, the Empress again visited the convent of Troïtza,\r\nwhither the Grand Duke, myself, and my mother followed her. For some\r\ntime the Empress had begun to treat my mother with much coldness. At the\r\nconvent of Troïtza, the reason for this became apparent. One afternoon,\r\nwhen the Grand Duke was in our room, the Empress entered suddenly, and\r\ndesired my mother to follow her into the other apartment. Count Lestocq\r\nfollowed there also. The Grand Duke and I sat upon a window-sill,\r\nwaiting. The conversation lasted a long time. At last, Count Lestocq\r\ncame out, and, in passing, came near the place where the Grand Duke and\r\nI were sitting laughing, and said to us, \"This merriment will soon\r\ncease.\" And then, turning to me, he added, \"You may pack up: you are\r\ngoing to set off home at once.\" The Grand Duke wished to know the reason\r\nof this. \"You will learn afterwards,\" was the reply of the Count, who\r\ndeparted to fulfil the commission with which he was charged, and of the\r\nnature of which I was ignorant. The Grand Duke and myself were left to\r\nruminate on what we had heard. His commentaries were in words; mine in\r\nthoughts. \"But,\" he said, \"if your mother is in fault, you are not.\" I\r\nanswered, \"My duty is to follow my mother, and do what she orders me.\" I\r\nsaw plainly that he would have parted from me without regret. As for\r\nmyself, considering his character and sentiments, the matter was nearly\r\nindifferent to me also, but the crown of Russia was not so. At last the\r\ndoor of the bed-room opened, and the Empress came out with a flushed\r\nface and an angry look. My mother followed her, her eyes red, and filled\r\nwith tears. As we scrambled down from the window where we were perched,\r\nand which was rather high, the Empress smiled. She then kissed us both,\r\nand departed. When she had gone, we learned pretty nearly how matters\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de la Chétardie, who formerly, or, to speak more correctly,\r\nin his first diplomatic journey to Russia, had stood very high in the\r\nfavour and confidence of the Empress, found himself, in his second\r\njourney, fallen from his hopes. His conversations were more measured\r\nthan his letters; these were filled with the most rancorous bitterness.\r\nThey had been opened, deciphered. In them were found the details of his\r\nconversations with my mother, and with many other persons, relative to\r\nthe affairs of the empire, and to the Empress herself; and as the\r\nMarquis had not displayed any character,[4] the order was given for\r\nexpelling him from the empire. The badge of the order of St. Andrew and\r\nthe portrait of the Empress were taken from him; but he was allowed to\r\nretain all the other presents of jewels made him by her Majesty. I do\r\nnot know whether my mother succeeded in justifying herself in the mind\r\nof the Empress, but at all events, we did not go away. However, my\r\nmother continued to be treated with much reserve and coldness. I do not\r\nknow what passed between her and La Chétardie, but I know that one day\r\nhe complimented me on my having my hair arranged _en Moyse_. I replied\r\nthat to satisfy the Empress, I would dress my hair in every style that\r\ncould give her pleasure. When he heard this he turned on his heel, went\r\noff in another direction, and did not again speak to me.\r\n\r\nOn our return from Moscow with the Grand Duke, my mother and I were more\r\nisolated. Fewer people came to see us, and I was being prepared for\r\nmaking my profession of faith. The 28th of June was fixed for this\r\nceremony, and the following day, the Feast of St. Peter, for my\r\nbetrothal with the Grand Duke. I remember that Marshal Brummer, several\r\ntimes during this period, complained to me of his pupil, and wished to\r\nmake use of me for correcting or reproving him; but I told him it was\r\nimpossible for me to do so, and that were I to attempt it I should only\r\nrender myself as odious to him as his attendants were already.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, my mother became very intimate with the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Hesse, and still more so with the brother of the latter, the\r\nChamberlain Retsky. This connection displeased the Countess Roumianzoff,\r\nMarshal Brummer, and, in fact, every one; and, while she was engaged\r\nwith them in her room, the Grand Duke and I were making a racket in the\r\nante-chamber, of which we were in full possession; we were neither of us\r\nwanting in youthful vivacity.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, the Empress celebrated, at Moscow, the peace with\r\nSweden. On this occasion, a Court was formed for me, as an affianced\r\nGrand Duchess of Russia; and, immediately after the celebration, the\r\nEmpress sent us off for Kiev. She set out herself some days later. We\r\nmade short stages--my mother and I, the Countess Roumianzoff, and one of\r\nthe ladies of my mother's suite in one carriage; the Grand Duke,\r\nBrummer, Berkholz, and Decken in another. One afternoon, the Grand Duke,\r\ntired of being with his pedagogues, wished to join my mother and me.\r\nOnce in with us, he would not leave our carriage. Then my mother,\r\nwearied with being always with him and me, took a fancy to augment our\r\ncompany. She communicated her idea to the young people of our suite,\r\namong whom were Prince Galitzine, since Marshal of this name, and Count\r\nZachar Czernicheff. One of the carriages, containing our beds, was\r\ntaken, benches were ranged all round it, and the next morning the Grand\r\nDuke, my mother and I, Prince Galitzine, Count Czernicheff, and one or\r\ntwo more of the youngest of the suite, entered it. And thus we passed\r\nthe rest of our journey very gaily, as far as our carriage life was\r\nconcerned; but all who were not with us protested against the\r\narrangement. It extremely displeased the Grand Marshal Brummer, the\r\nGreat Chamberlain Berkholz, the Countess Roumianzoff, the\r\nLady-in-waiting on my mother, and, in fact, all the rest of the suite,\r\nbecause they were never admitted; and, while we laughed through the\r\njourney, they were grumbling and wearied.\r\n\r\nIn this manner we reached Koselsk, at the end of three weeks, and there\r\nremained three other weeks waiting for the Empress, who had been delayed\r\non her route by several occurrences. We learnt at Koselsk that during\r\nher journey several persons of her suite had been sent into exile, and\r\nthat she was in very bad humour. At last, about the middle of August,\r\nshe reached Koselsk, and we remained there with her till the end of the\r\nmonth. While there, the people played at faro from morning till night,\r\nin a large hall in the centre of the house, and they played high. We\r\nwere all much cramped in point of space. My mother and I slept in the\r\nsame room, the Countess Roumianzoff and the Lady-in-waiting on my mother\r\nin the ante-chamber, and so on with the others. One day, when the Grand\r\nDuke came into our room, my mother was writing, while her casket lay\r\nopen at her side. The Duke, from curiosity, wanted to rummage in the\r\ncasket; my mother told him not to touch it; and, in point of fact, he\r\nmoved away and went capering about the place. But while leaping here\r\nand there in order to make me laugh, he caught the lid of the casket and\r\nupset it. Then my mother got angry, and hard words passed between them.\r\nShe accused him of having upset the casket on purpose; he denied this,\r\nand complained of her injustice. Both appealed to me. Knowing my\r\nmother's temper, I was afraid of getting my ears boxed if I did not side\r\nwith her; and, on the other hand, I did not wish to tell a falsehood or\r\ndisplease the Grand Duke, so that I was between two fires. However, I\r\ntold my mother that I did not think the Duke had done it intentionally,\r\nbut that, while leaping, his dress had caught the lid of the casket,\r\nwhich stood on a very small stool. Then my mother took me in hand, for\r\nwhen she was angry she must have some one to find fault with. I was\r\nsilent and began to cry. The Grand Duke finding that all my mother's\r\nanger fell upon me, because I had testified in his favour, and seeing me\r\nin tears, accused her of injustice and of being mad with passion; to\r\nwhich she retorted by calling him a very ill-behaved little boy. In a\r\nword, it would have been difficult to go farther than they did without\r\nactually coming to blows. From this moment the Grand Duke took a dislike\r\nto my mother; nor did he ever forget this quarrel. She, on the other\r\nhand, retained a grudge against him, and their behaviour to each other\r\ntended to produce restraint, distrust, and bitterness. They seldom\r\nconcealed their feelings when with me, and it was in vain that I sought\r\nto soften them towards each other. I never succeeded beyond the moment,\r\nand that but rarely. They had always some sarcasm ready for annoyance,\r\nand my situation became every day more painful. I tried to obey the one\r\nand please the other; and, indeed, at that time the Grand Duke gave me\r\nhis confidence more completely than he did to any one else; for he saw\r\nthat my mother often took me to task, when she was unable to fasten upon\r\nhim. This, of course, did me no harm in his estimation, for he felt that\r\nhe could count upon me.\r\n\r\nFinally, on the 29th of August we reached Kiev. We remained there ten\r\ndays, and then set out for Moscow, travelling in precisely the same\r\nmanner as before.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at Moscow, the entire autumn was passed in dramatic\r\nrepresentations, ballets, and court masquerades. In spite of all this,\r\nhowever, it was evident that the Empress was often in bad humour. One\r\nday while at the theatre, my mother, the Grand Duke, and I, being in a\r\nbox opposite her Majesty, I perceived the Empress speaking very warmly\r\nand angrily to Count Lestocq. When she had ended, the Count left her and\r\ncame to our box. Approaching me he said, \"Have you seen how the Empress\r\nspoke to me?\" I answered that I had. \"Very well, then,\" he said; \"she is\r\nvery angry with you.\" \"With me! and why?\" I replied. \"Because,\" he said,\r\n\"you are much in debt. She says that wells may be dried up; that when\r\nshe was a princess she had no greater allowance than you have, though\r\nshe had an establishment to provide for; and that she took care not to\r\nget into debt, because she knew that no one would pay for her.\" All this\r\nhe uttered in a dry tone and with an air of displeasure, apparently that\r\nthe Empress might see from her box how he had executed his commission.\r\nTears came into my eyes, and I was silent. Having finished what he had\r\nto say, the Count departed. The Grand Duke, who was seated at my side,\r\nheard most of the conversation; and after questioning me relative to the\r\nremainder, he gave me to understand, rather by looks than words, that he\r\nagreed with his aunt and was not sorry I had been scolded. This was his\r\ngeneral way of acting, and he fancied he should thus render himself\r\nagreeable to the Empress by entering into her views when she was angry\r\nwith any one. My mother also, when she learnt what had happened, said it\r\nwas only the natural consequence of the pains that had been taken to\r\nwithdraw me from her control; and that since they had put me in a\r\ncondition to act without consulting her, she should wash her hands of\r\nthe matter. Thus they both took part against me.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I determined instantly to put my affairs into order; and the\r\nnext morning I called for my accounts. From these I found that I was in\r\ndebt to the amount of 17,000 roubles. Before leaving Moscow for Kiev,\r\nthe Empress had sent me 15,000 roubles and a large chest of simple\r\ndresses; but it was necessary for me to be richly dressed, so that,\r\neverything reckoned, I owed 2,000 roubles, and this did not appear to me\r\nan unreasonable sum. Different causes had thrown me into these expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I had arrived in Russia very badly provided for. If\r\nI had three or four dresses in the world, it was the very outside; and\r\nthis at a court where people changed their dress three times a-day. A\r\ndozen chemises constituted the whole of my linen, and I had to use my\r\nmother's sheets.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, I had been told that in Russia people liked\r\npresents; and that generosity was the best means of acquiring friends\r\nand making one's self agreeable.\r\n\r\nThirdly, they had placed with me the most extravagant woman in Russia,\r\nthe Countess Roumianzoff, who was always surrounded with tradesmen, and\r\nconstantly showing me a variety of things which she induced me to\r\npurchase, and which I often purchased merely to present them to her, as\r\nI knew she was eager to have them.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke also cost me not a little, for he was fond of presents.\r\n\r\nBesides, I had found out that my mother's ill-humour was easily appeased\r\nby the present of anything that pleased her; and as she was often out of\r\ntemper, and especially with me, I did not neglect this means of soothing\r\nher. Her ill-humour arose in part from her being on such a bad footing\r\nwith the Empress, and from the fact that her Majesty often subjected her\r\nto annoyances and humiliations. Besides, heretofore, I had always\r\nfollowed her; and now she could not without displeasure see me take\r\nprecedence of her. I carefully avoided doing so, whenever it was\r\npossible; but in public it could not be avoided. In general, I had made\r\nit a rule to pay her the greatest respect, and treat her with all\r\npossible deference; but it was of no use, she had always and on all\r\noccasions some disagreeable remark to make, a thing which did not do her\r\nmuch good or prepossess people in her favour.\r\n\r\nThe Countess Roumianzoff, by her scandals and gossippings, contributed\r\nmuch--as did many others--to prejudice my mother in the opinion of the\r\nEmpress. That carriage for eight, during the journey to Kiev, had also\r\nmuch to do with this result. All the old had been excluded; all the\r\nyoung admitted. God only knows what was tortured out of this\r\narrangement, harmless as it was in itself. What was most evident was,\r\nthat it had displeased all those who by their rank were entitled to\r\nadmission, but were, nevertheless, set aside for the sake of more\r\namusing companions. But the real foundation of all this trouble was the\r\nexclusion of Betzky and the Troubetzkoys, in whom my mother had most\r\nconfidence during the journey to Kiev. Brummer and the Countess\r\nRoumianzoff had also, no doubt, contributed to it; and the carriage for\r\neight, into which they had not been admitted, was a source of rancour.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, the Grand Duke took the measles, at Moscow. As\r\nI had not had them, care was taken to prevent me from catching them.\r\nThose who were about the Prince did not come near us, and all diversions\r\nceased. As soon as the disease had passed off, and the winter fully set\r\nin, we left Moscow for St. Petersburg, in sledges; my mother and me in\r\none, the Grand Duke and Brummer in another. We celebrated the birthday\r\nof the Empress, the 18th of December, at Tver, and the next day\r\ncontinued our journey. Having reached the town of Chotilovo--about\r\nmidway--the Grand Duke, while in my room in the evening, became unwell.\r\nHe was led to his own apartments, and put to bed. He had considerable\r\nfever during the night. At noon, the next day, my mother and I went to\r\nsee him; but I had scarcely passed the threshold when Count Brummer\r\nadvanced towards me, and desired me not to proceed farther. I asked the\r\nreason, and learnt that indications of small-pox had just manifested\r\nthemselves. As I had not had the disease, my mother instantly hurried me\r\nout of the room; and it was decided that she and I should set off the\r\nsame day for St. Petersburg, leaving the Duke and his suite at\r\nChotilovo. The Countess Roumianzoff and the lady in attendance on my\r\nmother remained there also, to nurse the invalid, they said.\r\n\r\nA courier, despatched to the Empress, had already preceded us, and was\r\nby this time at St. Petersburg. At some distance from Novogorod, we met\r\nthe Empress herself, who, having learnt that the Grand Duke had taken\r\nthe small-pox, was on her way from St. Petersburg to Chotilovo, where\r\nshe remained as long as the disease lasted. As soon as she perceived\r\nus, though it was in the middle of the night, she stopped her sledge and\r\nours to make inquiries concerning the condition of the Duke. My mother\r\ntold her all she knew, and she then bade the driver proceed, while we\r\ncontinued our journey, and reached Novogorod towards morning.\r\n\r\nIt was a Sunday, and I went to mass, after which we dined; and just as\r\nwe were about to start again, the Chamberlain, Prince Galitzine, and the\r\nGentleman of the Bedchamber, Zachar Czernicheff, arrived from Moscow, on\r\ntheir way to St. Petersburg. My mother was angry with the Prince because\r\nhe was in company with Count Czernicheff, who had told some falsehood or\r\nother. She maintained that he ought to be avoided as a dangerous\r\ncharacter, who indulged in gratuitous fabrications. She sulked with them\r\nboth; but as this sulking was dreadfully wearisome, as, besides, there\r\nwas no choice in the matter, and as these two gentlemen were better\r\ninformed and had more conversational powers than any of the others, I\r\ndid not join in these sulks, and this drew upon me some unpleasant\r\nremarks from my mother.\r\n\r\nAt last we reached St. Petersburg, and took up our residence in one of\r\nthe houses attached to the court. The palace, at that time, was not\r\nsufficiently large to allow even the Grand Duke to reside there, so that\r\nhe occupied a house situated between the palace and ours. My apartments\r\nwere at the left of the palace, my mother's at the right. As soon as she\r\nsaw this arrangement, she became angry: first, because she thought my\r\nrooms better situated than her own; secondly, because hers were\r\nseparated from mine by a common hall. In point of fact, we each had four\r\nrooms, two in front and two facing the court-yard of the house. The\r\nrooms were equal in size, and furnished exactly alike, the furniture\r\nbeing blue and red. But what chiefly contributed to annoy my mother was\r\nthe circumstance which I am going to mention. While we were at Moscow,\r\nthe Countess Roumianzoff had brought me the plan of this house by\r\ndirection of the Empress, forbidding me, in her name, to speak of the\r\nmatter, and consulting me as to how my mother and myself should be\r\nrespectively placed. There was no choice in the case, for the two sets\r\nof apartments were in all respects equal. I said so to the Countess, and\r\nshe gave me to understand that the Empress preferred my having separate\r\nrooms to occupying, as at Moscow, the same apartments as my mother. This\r\nchange pleased me also, for I was much inconvenienced in being with my\r\nmother, and, in fact, no one liked the arrangement. My mother in some\r\nway got to hear of the plan that had been shown me. She spoke to me on\r\nthe subject, and I told the simple truth, just as the matter had\r\noccurred. She scolded me for the secrecy I had maintained. I said I had\r\nbeen forbidden to speak; but she would not admit the validity of this\r\nreason, and altogether I saw that from day to day, she became more and\r\nmore displeased with me, and, in fact, she had managed to quarrel with\r\nalmost every one, so that she now scarcely ever came to table, either\r\nfor dinner or supper, but was served in her own room. As for me, I went\r\nto her apartments three or four times a-day. The rest of my time was\r\nspent in learning Russian, in playing on the harpsichord, and in\r\nreading, for I had bought myself books; so that at fifteen I was\r\nretired, and tolerably studious for my age.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of our stay at Moscow, a Swedish embassy arrived, at\r\nthe head of which was the Senator Cedercreutz. A short time afterwards,\r\nthe Count Gyllenburg also arrived, to announce to the Empress the\r\nmarriage of the Prince of Sweden, my mother's brother, with a Swedish\r\nprincess. Count Gyllenburg, and many other Swedes, became known to us at\r\nthe time of the Prince Royal's departure for Sweden. He was a man of\r\ntalent, no longer young, and my mother thought very highly of him. For\r\nmyself, I was, in some respects, under obligations to him; for at\r\nHamburg, seeing that my mother made little or no account of me, he told\r\nher she was wrong, and assured her that I was a child much beyond my\r\nage. On his arrival at St. Petersburg, he visited us, and as he had told\r\nme, while at Hamburg, that I had a very philosophical turn of mind, he\r\nasked me how it fared with my philosophy in the vortex in which I was\r\nplaced. I told him how I passed my time in my room. He replied that a\r\nphilosopher of fifteen could not know herself, and that I was surrounded\r\nby so many rocks that I ran great danger of being wrecked, unless the\r\ntemper of my mind was of a very superior stamp; that I ought, therefore,\r\nto fortify it by the study of the best works, such as the Lives of\r\nPlutarch, that of Cicero, and the Causes of the Greatness and Decay of\r\nthe Roman Republic, by Montesquieu. I immediately ordered those books to\r\nbe procured for me, and there was considerable difficulty in finding\r\nthem in St. Petersburg at that period. I told the Count that I would\r\ntrace my portrait for him, such as I supposed it, that he might see\r\nwhether or not I really did understand myself.\r\n\r\nI did, in fact, trace out this portrait in writing, and gave it to him\r\nunder the following title:--\"A Portrait of the Philosopher of Fifteen.\"\r\nMany years afterwards, viz., in the year 1758, I turned up this\r\nportrait; and I was astonished at the accuracy and depth of\r\nself-knowledge which it evinced. Unfortunately I burnt it that same\r\nyear, with all my other papers, fearing to keep a single one in my room,\r\nat the time of the unfortunate affair of Bestoujeff.\r\n\r\nCount Gyllenburg returned my manuscript a few days afterwards. I do not\r\nknow whether he took a copy. He accompanied it by some dozen pages of\r\nreflections which he had made relative to me. In these he endeavoured to\r\nstrengthen my character in firmness and elevation of mind, as well as in\r\nall the other qualities of the head and heart. I read his remarks again\r\nand again, many times. I impressed them on my mind, and determined very\r\nsincerely to follow his advice. I made a promise to myself that I would\r\ndo so, and when once I have made a promise to myself, I do not remember\r\never having failed in keeping it. Finally, I returned the manuscript to\r\nthe Count as he had requested, and I confess that it has been of great\r\nservice to me in forming and strengthening my mind and character.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of February, the Empress returned from Chotilovo with\r\nthe Grand Duke. As soon as we had heard of her arrival we went to\r\nreceive her, and met her in the great hall, between four and five\r\no'clock in the evening, when it was nearly dark. Notwithstanding the\r\nobscurity, however, I was almost terrified at beholding the Grand Duke.\r\nHe had grown very much, but his features were scarcely to be recognized;\r\nthey had all enlarged; the whole face was still swelled, and it was\r\nquite evident that he would remain deeply marked. As his hair had been\r\ncut off, he wore an immense wig, which greatly added to his\r\ndisfigurement. He came to me, and asked if I did not find it difficult\r\nto recognize him. I stammered out my congratulations upon his\r\nconvalescence, but in truth he had grown frightful.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of February, 1745, a year had passed since my arrival at the\r\ncourt of Russia. On the 10th, the Empress celebrated the birthday of the\r\nGrand Duke. He had now entered his seventeenth year. On this occasion, I\r\ndined with her Majesty. She dined upon the throne, and I was the only\r\nguest. The Grand Duke did not appear in public that day, nor for a long\r\ntime afterwards; they were in no hurry to show him in the condition in\r\nwhich the small-pox had left him. The Empress was very gracious during\r\ndinner. She told me that the letters I had written to her in Russian,\r\nwhile she was at Chotilovo, had very much pleased her (to tell the\r\ntruth, they were the composition of M. Adadourof, though I had copied\r\nthem out;) and she also said she had been informed that I took great\r\npains to acquire the language of the country. She spoke to me in\r\nRussian, and wished me to reply to her in that language, which I did;\r\nand then she was pleased to praise my correct pronunciation. Finally,\r\nshe told me that I had grown handsomer since my illness at Moscow. In\r\nfact, during the whole time of dinner, she was occupied in giving me\r\nmarks of her kindness and affection. I returned home highly delighted\r\nwith my dinner, and received congratulations on all sides. The Empress\r\nhad my portrait, which the painter Caravaque had commenced, brought to\r\nher, and she kept it in her own room. It is the one which the sculptor\r\nFalconnet has carried with him to France. At the time, it was a speaking\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\nIn going to mass, or to the Empress, my mother and I had to pass through\r\nthe apartments of the Grand Duke, which were situated near mine; we\r\ntherefore often saw him. He also was in the habit of coming of an\r\nevening, to pass some moments with me; but there was no eagerness in\r\nthese visits. On the contrary, he was always glad of any excuse for\r\ndispensing with them, and remaining at home, occupied with the childish\r\namusements already mentioned.\r\n\r\nA short time after the arrival of the Empress and Grand Duke at St.\r\nPetersburg, my mother met with a serious annoyance, which she could not\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nPrince Augustus, her brother, had written to her at Kiev, expressing his\r\ngreat desire to visit Russia. She had learnt that the only object of\r\nthis journey was to have the administration of the territory of Holstein\r\nconferred upon him as soon as the Grand Duke became of age; and it was\r\nproposed to advance the period of his majority. In other words, it was\r\nwished to take the guardianship out of the hands of the elder brother,\r\nnow become Prince Royal of Sweden, in order to give the administration\r\nof the territory of Holstein, in the name of the Grand Duke, then of\r\nage, to Prince Augustus, the younger brother of my mother and of the\r\nPrince Royal of Sweden.\r\n\r\nThis intrigue had been formed by the Holstein party, which was opposed\r\nto the Prince Royal, joined by the Danes, who could not pardon this\r\nPrince for having prevailed, in Sweden, over the Prince Royal of\r\nDenmark, whom the Dalecarlians wished to elect as successor to the\r\nthrone of Sweden. My mother replied to Prince Augustus from Koselsk,\r\ntelling him, that instead of lending himself to intrigues directed\r\nagainst his brother, it would be better for him to enter the service of\r\nHolland, where he was, and die with honour, rather than cabal against\r\nhis brother and join the enemies of his sister in Russia. My mother had\r\nhere reference to Count Bestoujeff, who encouraged all this intrigue in\r\norder to injure Brummer, and all the other friends of the Prince Royal\r\nof Sweden, the guardian of the Grand Duke for Holstein. This letter was\r\nopened, and read by the Count and the Empress, who was by no means\r\npleased with my mother, and very much irritated against the Prince Royal\r\nof Sweden, who, led by his wife, sister of the King of Prussia, had\r\nallowed himself to be carried away by the French party in all their\r\nviews, a party in every way opposed to Russia. He was accused of\r\ningratitude, and my mother of want of affection for her younger brother,\r\nbecause she had told him to die (_se faire tuer_), an expression which\r\nwas treated as harsh and inhuman; while my mother, in the company of her\r\nfriends, boasted of having used a firm and sounding phrase. The result\r\nof all this was, that without any regard for my mother's feelings, or\r\nrather to mortify her and annoy the Holstein-Swedish party, Count\r\nBestoujeff obtained permission, unknown to my mother, for Prince\r\nAugustus of Holstein to visit St. Petersburg. My mother, when she learnt\r\nthat he was on his way, was extremely annoyed and grieved, and received\r\nhim very coldly. But he, pushed on by Bestoujeff, ran his course. The\r\nEmpress was persuaded to give him a favourable reception, which she did\r\nin appearance. This, however, did not last, and could not last, for\r\nPrince Augustus was not in himself a person of any consequence. Even his\r\nexternal appearance was against him. He was very small, and badly made,\r\npassionate, and with but little talent, and entirely led by his\r\nfollowers, who were themselves quite insignificant. His stupidity, since\r\nI must speak out, very much annoyed my mother, and, altogether, his\r\narrival nearly drove her crazy.\r\n\r\nCount Bestoujeff, having obtained a control over the mind of the Prince\r\nby means of his followers, killed many birds with one stone. He could\r\nnot be ignorant that the Grand Duke hated Brummer as much as he did\r\nhimself. Prince Augustus did not like him either, because he was\r\nattached to the Prince Royal of Sweden, under pretence of relationship\r\nand as a native of Holstein. Prince Augustus ingratiated himself with\r\nthe Grand Duke by constantly talking to him about Holstein and his\r\ncoming majority, so that he induced him to urge his aunt and Count\r\nBestoujeff to advance the period. To do this, however, it was necessary\r\nto have the consent of the Roman Emperor, who, at that time, was Charles\r\nVII, of the House of Bavaria. But, meantime, he died, and the matter\r\ndragged on till the election of Francis I.\r\n\r\nAs Prince Augustus had been coldly received by my mother, and, in\r\nreturn, manifested but little consideration for her, this circumstance\r\nalso contributed to diminish the slight remains of respect which the\r\nGrand Duke entertained for her. On the other hand, both Prince Augustus\r\nand the old valet, the favourite of the Grand Duke, fearing, seemingly,\r\nmy future influence, often talked to him about the manner in which he\r\nought to treat his wife. Romberg, an old Swedish dragoon, told him that\r\nhis wife dared not speak in his presence nor meddle with his affairs;\r\nand that if she only attempted to open her mouth even, he ordered her to\r\nhold her tongue; that he was master in his own house, and that it was\r\ndisgraceful for a husband to allow himself to be led by his wife like a\r\nbooby.\r\n\r\nNow the Grand Duke had about as much discretion as a cannon ball, and,\r\nwhen his mind was full of anything, he could not rest until he had\r\nunburdened it to the persons he was in the habit of talking with, never\r\nfor a moment considering to whom it was he spoke. Consequently he used\r\nto tell me all these things, with the utmost frankness, the first time\r\nhe saw me afterwards. He always fancied that every one was of his\r\nopinion, and that nothing could be more reasonable than all this. I took\r\ngood care not to speak of these things to any one; but they made me\r\nreflect very seriously upon the fate which awaited me. I determined to\r\nhusband carefully the confidence of the Grand Duke, in order that he\r\nmight at least consider me as a person of whom he felt sure, and to whom\r\nhe could confide everything without the least inconvenience to himself;\r\nand in this I succeeded for a long time. Besides, I treated every one in\r\nthe best way I could, and studied how to gain the friendship, or at\r\nleast to lessen the enmity of those whom I in any way suspected of being\r\nbadly disposed to me. I showed no leaning to any side, nor meddled with\r\nanything; always maintained a serene air, treated every one with great\r\nattention, affability, and politeness, and, as I was naturally very gay,\r\nI saw with pleasure that from day to day I advanced in the general\r\nesteem, and was looked upon as an interesting child, and one by no means\r\nwanting in mind. I showed great respect for my mother, a boundless\r\nobedience for the Empress, and the most profound deference for the Grand\r\nDuke; and I sought with the most anxious care to gain the affection of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nFrom the period of our visit to Moscow, the Empress had assigned me some\r\nladies and gentlemen who formed my court. A short time after my arrival\r\nat St. Petersburg she gave me some Russian maids, in order, as she said,\r\nto aid me in acquiring increased facility in the use of the language.\r\nThis arrangement pleased me very much; for these persons were all young,\r\nthe oldest of them being only about twenty; all, too, were very lively,\r\nso that from that time I did nothing but sing, dance, and play in my\r\nroom, from the moment I awoke in the morning till I went to sleep again\r\nat night. In the evening, after supper, I brought into my bed-room my\r\nthree maids, the two Princesses Gagarine and Mademoiselle Koucheleff,\r\nand we played at blind-man's buff and all sorts of games suited to our\r\nage. All these ladies mortally feared the Countess Roumianzoff; but as\r\nshe played at cards from morning till night, either in the ante-chamber\r\nor in her own room, never leaving her chair, except from necessity, she\r\nrarely came near us.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our mirth, the fancy seized me to distribute among my\r\nwomen the care of all my effects. I placed my money, my expenditure, and\r\nmy linen in the charge of Mademoiselle Schenck, the lady's-maid whom I\r\nhad brought from Germany; she was a silly and querulous old maid, to\r\nwhom our gaiety was extremely annoying; and besides that, she was\r\njealous of all these young companions who were about to share her\r\nfunctions and my affection. I gave all my jewels to Mademoiselle\r\nJoukoff; she having more intelligence and being more gay and frank than\r\nthe others, began to gain my favour. My clothes I entrusted to my valet\r\nTimothy Yevreinoff; my lace to Mademoiselle Balkoff, who afterwards\r\nmarried the poet Soumarokoff; my ribbons to the elder Mademoiselle\r\nScorochodov, since married to Aristarchus Kachkine; her younger sister\r\nAnne having nothing, as she was only between thirteen and fourteen years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe day after this grand arrangement, in which I had exercised my\r\ncentral power within the limits of my own chamber, and without\r\nconsulting a living soul, there were theatricals in the evening. To go\r\nto them, it was necessary to pass through my mother's apartments. The\r\nEmpress, the Grand Duke, and the whole court were there. A little\r\ntheatre had been erected in a riding-school, which, in the time of the\r\nEmpress Anne, had been used by the Duke of Courland, whose apartments I\r\nnow occupied. After the play, when the Empress had retired, the Countess\r\nRoumianzoff came into my room, and told me that the Empress disapproved\r\nof the arrangement I had made in distributing the care of my effects\r\namong my women, and that she was ordered to withdraw the keys of my\r\njewels out of the hands of Mademoiselle Joukoff, and restore them to\r\nMademoiselle Schenck, which she did in my presence, and then departed,\r\nleaving Mademoiselle Joukoff and me with faces somewhat elongated, and\r\nMademoiselle Schenck triumphing in the marked confidence of the Empress.\r\nShe began to assume with me arrogant airs, which made her more\r\nridiculous than ever, and even less amiable than she had been before.\r\n\r\nThe first week of Lent I had a singular scene with the Grand Duke. In\r\nthe morning, while in my room with my maids, who were all very devout,\r\nlistening to matins, which were sung in the ante-chamber, I received an\r\nembassy from the Grand Duke. He had sent me his dwarf to inquire how I\r\nwas, and to tell me that, on account of its being Lent, he should not\r\nvisit me that day. The dwarf found us all listening to the prayers, and\r\nfulfilling exactly the prescriptions of Lent, according to our creed. I\r\nreturned the usual compliments to the Duke, through his dwarf, who then\r\ndeparted. When he got back, whether it was that he had really been\r\nedified by what he had seen, or that he wished his dear lord and master,\r\nwho was anything but devout, to do the same, he passed a high eulogium\r\nupon the devotion which reigned in my apartments, and, by doing so, put\r\nthe Duke in a very bad humour with me. The first time we met he began by\r\nsulking. Having asked the cause of this, he scolded me very much for\r\nwhat he called the excessive devotion to which I gave myself up. When I\r\nasked who had told him this, he named his dwarf as an eye-witness of it.\r\nI told him I did no more than was proper, only what every one else did,\r\nand what could not be dispensed with without scandal; but he thought\r\ndifferently. The dispute ended as most disputes do, by leaving each one\r\nwith his own opinion; but, as his Imperial Highness had no one but me to\r\nspeak to during mass, he gradually left off pouting.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, I had another alarm. In the morning, while matins were\r\nbeing sung in my apartments, Mademoiselle Schenck entered my room in\r\ngreat consternation, telling me that my mother had been taken ill, and\r\nhad fainted. I instantly ran to her, and found her lying on the ground\r\non a mattress, but not unconscious. I ventured to ask her what was the\r\nmatter. She told me, that wishing to be bled, the surgeon was so clumsy\r\nas to miss four times, having tried both arms and both feet, and that\r\nshe had fainted. I knew that she dreaded bleeding; I was ignorant of her\r\nintention in wishing to be bled, and did not even know that she stood in\r\nneed of it. Yet she reproached me with caring little for her condition,\r\nand said many disagreeable things on the subject. I excused myself in\r\nthe best way I could, acknowledging my ignorance; but, seeing that she\r\nwas in a very bad humour, I became silent, and endeavoured to restrain\r\nmy tears, nor did I leave her till she had desired me to do so with some\r\ndegree of harshness. On my return to my room, in tears, my maids wanted\r\nto know what was the matter, and I told them quite simply. I went\r\nseveral times during the day to my mother's room, and remained there as\r\nlong as I thought I could do so without being troublesome. This was a\r\ncapital point with her, to which I was so well accustomed, that there is\r\nnothing I have so carefully avoided during my life as remaining with any\r\none longer than I was wanted. I have made it a point instantly to retire\r\nwhenever the least suspicion crossed my mind that my farther stay would\r\nbe an inconvenience. But I know by experience that every one does not\r\nact upon the same principle, for my own patience has often been put to\r\nthe test by those who do not know how to go away before they have worn\r\nout their welcome or become a source of weariness.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Lent, my mother had a grief which was very real. At\r\na time when it was least expected, she received the news of the sudden\r\ndeath of my younger sister, Elizabeth, a child only between three and\r\nfour years old. She was very much afflicted, and I grieved also.\r\n\r\nOne morning, some few days afterwards, I saw the Empress come into my\r\nroom. She sent for my mother, and they retired to my dressing-room,\r\nwhere they had a long and private conversation; after which they\r\nreturned into my bed-room, and I saw that my mother's eyes were red and\r\nfilled with tears. From the sequence of the conversation I understood\r\nthat they had been talking about the death of the Emperor Charles VII,\r\nof the house of Bavaria, the news of which had just reached the Empress.\r\nHer Majesty was then without alliance, and she hesitated between Prussia\r\nand the house of Austria, each of which had their partisans. She had the\r\nsame complaint against Austria as against France, towards which the King\r\nof Prussia leaned, for the Marquis de Botta, the minister of the court\r\nof Vienna had been sent away from Russia for speaking against the\r\nEmpress--an act which at the time it was sought to represent as a\r\nconspiracy. The Marquis de la Chétardie had been similarly dismissed for\r\nthe same reasons. I do not know what was the object of this\r\nconversation, but my mother seemed to conceive great hopes from it, and\r\nwent away very well satisfied. As for me, I was in all this simply a\r\nspectator, and one, too, very passive, very discreet, and pretty nearly\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter, when the spring had fully set in, I expressed to the\r\nCountess Roumianzoff the desire I had to learn to ride, and she obtained\r\nthe consent of the Empress. I had begun to have pains in the chest at\r\nthe commencement of the year, after the pleurisy I had had in Moscow,\r\nand I was still very thin. The doctors ordered me milk and Seltzer water\r\nevery morning. It was at Roumianzoff House, in the barracks of the\r\nIsmaïlofsky regiment, that I took my first lesson in riding. I had\r\nalready ridden several times at Moscow, but very badly.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, the Empress, with the Grand Duke, went to occupy\r\nthe Summer Palace. To my mother and I had been assigned a stone\r\nbuilding, by the side of the Fontanka, close to the house of Peter I. My\r\nmother occupied one side of this building, and I the other. Here ended\r\nall the assiduities of the Grand Duke; he told me quite plainly, and\r\nthrough a servant, that he now lived too far off to come and see me\r\noften. I fully perceived his want of interest, and how little I was\r\ncared for. My self-esteem and vanity grieved in silence, but I was too\r\nproud to complain. I should have thought myself degraded if any one had\r\nshown me a friendship which I could have taken for pity. Nevertheless, I\r\nshed tears when alone, then quietly dried them up, and went to romp with\r\nmy maids. My mother also treated me with great coldness and ceremony,\r\nbut I never missed visiting her several times during the day. At heart I\r\nfelt very sad, but I took care not to speak of this. However,\r\nMademoiselle Joukoff one day perceived my tears, and spoke to me on the\r\nsubject. I gave her the best reasons I could, without however giving her\r\nthe true ones. I laboured more earnestly than before to gain the\r\naffection of every one. Great or small, I neglected no one, but laid it\r\ndown to myself as a rule to believe that I stood in need of every one,\r\nand so to act in consequence as to obtain the good will of all; and I\r\nsucceeded in doing so.\r\n\r\nAfter some days' stay in the Summer Palace, where people began to speak\r\nof the preparations for my marriage, the court removed to Peterhoff,\r\nwhere it was more concentrated than in the city. The Empress and the\r\nGrand Duke occupied the upper portion of the house built by Peter I; my\r\nmother and I were beneath, in the apartments of the Grand Duke. We dined\r\nwith him every day, under a tent, upon the open gallery adjoining his\r\napartments; he supped with us. The Empress was often absent, moving\r\nabout among her different country residences. We were out a good deal,\r\nwalking, riding, or driving. I then saw as clear as day, that the\r\npersons about the Grand Duke had lost all credit with him, and all\r\ncontrol over him. The military games, which he formerly carried on in\r\nprivate, he now enacted almost in their presence. Count Brummer and his\r\nhead master scarcely ever saw him, except to follow him in public. The\r\nrest of his time was literally passed, in the company of his valets, in\r\nacts of childishness unheard of at his age, for he played at puppets.\r\n\r\nMy mother took advantage of the absences of the Empress to go and sup at\r\nthe neighbouring mansions, and especially at that of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Hesse-Homburg. One evening when she had ridden out there, I\r\nwas sitting, after supper, in my room, which was on a level with the\r\ngarden, one of the doors leading into it, when I felt tempted by the\r\nfine weather. I proposed to my maids and my three ladies of honour to\r\ntake a walk in the garden; and I had no great trouble in persuading\r\nthem. We were eight, and my valet, who made nine, followed us with two\r\nother valets. We walked about till midnight in the most innocent manner\r\npossible. My mother having returned, Mademoiselle Schenck, who had\r\nrefused to accompany us, and grumbled at our project, was in a great\r\nhurry to tell her that I had gone out against her advice. My mother went\r\nto bed, and when I got back with my troop, Mademoiselle Schenck told me,\r\nwith an air of triumph, that my mother had sent twice to inquire if I\r\nhad returned, as she wished to speak to me; but that as it was very\r\nlate, and she tired of waiting, she had gone to bed. I would have\r\ninstantly gone to her, but I found the door closed. I told Schenck that\r\nshe might have had me called. She pretended that she had not been able\r\nto find us; but this was a mere story to make a quarrel, and get me\r\nscolded; I saw this clearly, and went to bed with a good deal of\r\nuneasiness. The following day, as soon as I awoke, I went to my mother\r\nand found her in bed. I approached to kiss her hand, but she angrily\r\nwithdrew it, and gave me a dreadful scolding for having dared to walk\r\nout at night without her permission. I said she was not at home; but she\r\nreplied that the hour was improper, and said all sorts of disagreeable\r\nthings, for the purpose, seemingly, of giving me a distaste for\r\nnocturnal promenades. This, however, is certain, that although this walk\r\nmay have been an imprudence, nothing could have been more innocent. What\r\nmost distressed me was, that she accused me of having gone up to the\r\napartments of the Grand Duke. I replied that this was an abominable\r\ncalumny, at which she became so enraged that she seemed out of herself.\r\nIt was in vain that I went on my knees to soothe her irritation. She\r\ntreated my submission as acting, and ordered me out of the room. I\r\nretired to my own apartments in tears. At dinner-time I ascended with\r\nher, she still being very angry, to the apartments of the Grand Duke,\r\nwho inquired what was the matter, as my eyes were very red. I told him\r\nexactly what had happened. This time he took my part, and accused my\r\nmother of being capricious and passionate. I begged him not to speak to\r\nher on the subject, which request he complied with, and by degrees her\r\nanger wore off; but I was always treated very coldly. We left Peterhoff\r\nat the end of July, and returned to the city, where all was preparation\r\nfor the approaching marriage.\r\n\r\nAt last the Empress fixed the 21st of August for the ceremony. As the\r\nday came nearer, I became more and more melancholy. My heart predicted\r\nbut little happiness; ambition alone sustained me. In my inmost soul\r\nthere was a something which never allowed me to doubt for a single\r\nmoment that sooner or later I should become the sovereign Empress of\r\nRussia in my own right.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was celebrated with much pomp and magnificence. In the\r\nevening I found in my room Madame Krause, sister of the head lady's-maid\r\nto the Empress, who had placed her with me as my head lady's-maid. From\r\nthe very next day I found that this person had thrown all my other women\r\ninto consternation, for on approaching one of them to speak to her, as\r\nusual, she said to me, \"In God's name, do not come near me; we have been\r\nforbidden to whisper to you.\" On the other hand, my beloved spouse did\r\nnot trouble himself in the slightest degree about me, but was constantly\r\nwith his valets, playing at soldiers, exercising them in his room, or\r\nchanging his uniform twenty times a-day. I yawned, and grew weary,\r\nhaving no one to speak to; or I endeavoured to keep up appearances. On\r\nthe third day after my marriage, the Countess Roumianzoff Sent me word\r\nthat the Empress had dispensed with her attendance on me, and that she\r\nwas going to return home to her husband and children. This did not\r\ngrieve me much, for she had been the cause of a great deal of scandal.\r\n\r\nThe marriage festivities lasted ten days, at the end of which the Grand\r\nDuke and myself took up our residence in the Summer Palace, where the\r\nEmpress was living; and the departure of my mother was beginning to be\r\ntalked of. Since my marriage I did not see her every day; but she had\r\nvery much softened towards me. About the latter end of September she\r\ntook her departure, the Grand Duke and I accompanying her as far as\r\nKrasnoe-Selo. I was sincerely afflicted, and wept a great deal. After\r\ntaking leave of her we returned to the city. On reaching the palace I\r\ncalled for Mademoiselle Joukoff. I was told that she had gone to see her\r\nmother who was ill. The next day I put the same question, and received\r\nthe same answer. About noon the Empress passed with great pomp from the\r\nSummer to the Winter Palace. We followed her to her apartments. Having\r\nreached the state bed-room she stopped, and, after some casual remarks,\r\nspoke of my mother's departure, and told me, with apparent kindness, to\r\nmoderate my grief. But I thought I should have dropped when she said, in\r\nthe presence of some thirty people, that at my mother's request she had\r\ndismissed from my service Mademoiselle Joukoff, because my mother feared\r\nI might become too much attached to a person who so little deserved my\r\nfavour; and then her Majesty spoke very pointedly against the poor girl.\r\nI certainly was no way edified with this scene, nor convinced of what\r\nher Majesty advanced; but I was deeply afflicted at the misfortune of\r\npoor Joukoff, dismissed from court solely because, from her sociable\r\ndisposition, she suited me better than my other women. \"For why,\" as I\r\nsaid to myself, \"was she placed with me if she was not worthy?\" My\r\nmother could not know her, could not even speak to her, as she did not\r\nunderstand Russian, the only language with which Joukoff was acquainted;\r\nshe could only have been guided by the silly remarks of Schenck, who\r\nscarcely possessed common sense. This girl suffers for me, I said to\r\nmyself; I must not, therefore, abandon her in her misfortune, of which\r\nmy affection has been the sole cause. I have never been able to learn\r\nwhether or not my mother really had requested the Empress to dismiss\r\nthis person from my service; if so, she must have preferred violent\r\nmeasures to those of mildness, for she never opened her lips to me in\r\nreference to the girl; and yet a single word from her would have been\r\nsufficient to put me on my guard, at least, against an attachment in\r\nitself very innocent. The Empress, also, might have acted with less\r\nausterity. The girl was young: it was only necessary to have found a\r\nsuitable match for her, which might easily have been done; but instead\r\nof this they acted in the manner I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Empress having dismissed us, the Grand Duke and I proceeded to our\r\nown apartments. On our way, I perceived that her Majesty had already\r\nacquainted her nephew with what she had done. I stated to him my\r\nobjections on the subject, and made him understand that this girl was\r\nunfortunate solely because it was supposed that I had a liking for her;\r\nand that since she was suffering on account of my affection, I thought\r\nmyself justified in not abandoning her, as far, at all events, as\r\ndepended on myself. In fact, I immediately sent her some money, through\r\nmy valet; but he informed me that she had already departed for Moscow\r\nwith her mother and sister. I ordered what I had destined for her to be\r\nsent through her brother, who was a sergeant in the guards. I learnt\r\nthat he also, together with his wife, had been ordered away, and that he\r\nhad been placed as an officer in a country regiment. At the present time\r\nI am scarcely able to give any plausible explanation of these things; it\r\nseems to me like doing wrong gratis, and from mere caprice, without a\r\nshadow of reason, or even of pretext. But matters did not stop even\r\nhere. Through my valet and my other attendants, I endeavoured to find\r\nfor Mademoiselle Joukoff a suitable match. One was proposed to me: it\r\nwas a sergeant in the guards, a gentleman of some property, named\r\nTravin. He went to Moscow to marry her, provided she suited him. He did\r\nmarry her, and was made lieutenant in a country regiment. As soon as the\r\nEmpress heard of this, she banished them both to Astracan. It is\r\ndifficult to find a reason for such persecution.\r\n\r\nAt the Winter Palace, the Grand Duke and I occupied the apartments which\r\nwe had previously used; those of the Duke were separated from mine by an\r\nimmense staircase, which also led to the apartments of the Empress. In\r\ngoing to him, or in his coming to me, it was necessary to cross the\r\nlanding of this staircase--not the pleasantest thing in the world,\r\nespecially in winter. Nevertheless, we made the passage several times\r\na-day. In the evening, I went to play at billiards in his ante-chamber\r\nwith the Chamberlain Berkholz, while he romped with his gentlemen in the\r\nother room. My party at billiards was interrupted by the retirement of\r\nBrummer and Berkholz, whom the Empress dismissed from attendance on the\r\nGrand Duke, at the end of the winter of 1746. This winter was passed in\r\nmasquerades given at the principal houses in the city, which were then\r\nvery small. The court and the whole town assisted at them regularly.\r\n\r\nThe last of them was given by the Master-General of the Police,\r\nTatizcheff, in a house called Smolnoy Dvoretz, belonging to the Empress.\r\nThe centre portion of this wooden house had been destroyed by a fire;\r\nnothing remained but the wings, which were of two stories. One of these\r\nwings was set apart for dancing; but in order to go to supper, which was\r\nlaid out in the other, it was necessary to pass, and this in the month\r\nof January, through the court-yard and the snow. After supper this\r\njourney had to be repeated. The Grand Duke returned home, and went to\r\nbed, but the next morning he awoke with a violent headache, which\r\nprevented him from rising. I sent for the doctors, who pronounced him in\r\na burning fever of the most violent kind. He was carried in the evening\r\nfrom my bed to the audience-chamber, where, after being bled, he was\r\nplaced in a bed arranged there for him. They bled him several times; he\r\nwas very ill. The Empress visited him frequently during the day, and\r\nseeing me in tears, she was pleased with me. One evening, while reading\r\nthe night-prayers in a small oratory adjoining my dressing-room, Madame\r\nIsmaïloff came in. She was a person of whom the Empress was very fond,\r\nand she informed me that her Majesty, knowing I was much afflicted by\r\nthe illness of the Duke, had sent her to tell me not to be cast down,\r\nbut to put my trust in God, and that whatever happened she would not\r\nforsake me. She then asked me what I was reading; I told her the prayers\r\nfor night, and she said I should hurt my eyes by reading such small\r\nprint by candle-light. I then begged her to thank her Imperial Majesty\r\nfor her goodness towards me, and we parted very affectionately, she to\r\ngive an account of her mission, I to go to bed. Next day the Empress\r\nsent me a prayer-book printed in large type, in order to preserve my\r\neyes, she said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the room in which the Grand Duke was placed adjoined mine, I\r\nnever entered it except when I felt that I should not be in the way, for\r\nI saw that he did not care much to have me there, but preferred being\r\nwith his attendants, who, on the other hand, did not much suit me.\r\nBesides, I was not much accustomed to pass my time alone among a set of\r\nmen. Meanwhile, Lent came round. I went to my duty (_fis mes\r\ndévotions_)[5] the first week. Generally speaking, I was inclined to\r\ndevotion at that period. I saw plainly that the Grand Duke cared little\r\nabout me. A fortnight after our marriage he confessed to me again that\r\nhe was in love with Mademoiselle Carr, Maid of Honour to her Imperial\r\nMajesty, since married to a Prince Galitzine, Equery to the Empress. He\r\ntold Count Devier,[6] his Chamberlain, that there was no comparison\r\nbetween that lady and me. Devier maintained the contrary, and the Duke\r\ngot angry with him. This scene took place almost in my presence, and I\r\nwitnessed their contest. Surely, I said to myself, it would be\r\nimpossible for me not to be unhappy with such a man as this, were I to\r\ngive way to sentiments of tenderness thus requited. I might die of\r\njealousy without benefit to any one. I endeavoured therefore to master\r\nmy feelings, so as not to be jealous of a man who did not love me. Had\r\nhe wished to be loved, I should have found no difficulty in loving him.\r\nI was naturally well disposed, and accustomed to fulfil my duties; but\r\nthen, too, I should have required a husband who had common sense, which\r\nthis one had not.\r\n\r\nI had abstained[7] (_fait maigre_) during the first week of Lent. On the\r\nSaturday, the Empress sent me word that it would give her pleasure if I\r\nabstained during the second week also. I replied that I begged her\r\nMajesty would permit me to abstain during the entire Lent. Sievers,\r\nMarshal of the Court to the Empress, a son-in-law to Madame Krause, who\r\nwas the bearer of this message, told me that the Empress was greatly\r\npleased with my request, and that she granted it. When the Grand Duke\r\nlearned that I continued to abstain, he scolded me a good deal; but I\r\ntold him I could not do otherwise. After he had got well, he still\r\nfeigned illness in order not to leave his room, where he found more\r\ncongenial amusement than in the formal life of the court. He did not\r\nquit it till the last week of Lent, when he went to his duty.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter, he had a marionette theatre set up in his room, and\r\ninvited company to see it, and even ladies. This show was the most\r\ninsipid thing imaginable. The room in which it was set up had a door\r\nwhich was fastened up, in consequence of its leading into one of the\r\nEmpress' apartments. In this apartment there was a mechanical table,\r\nwhich could be lowered and raised so as to admit of dining without\r\nservants. One day, while the Grand Duke was in his room preparing his\r\nso-called theatricals, he heard people talking in this room beyond, and,\r\nwith his usual inconsiderate vivacity, he took up from his theatre one\r\nof those carpenters' tools used for making holes in boards, and set to\r\nwork boring holes in this condemned door, so that he could see all that\r\npassed within, and among other things, the dinner which the Empress was\r\nthen taking there. The Master of the Hounds, Count Razoumowsky, in a\r\nbrocaded dressing-gown, dined with her--he had taken medicine that\r\nday--and there were, besides, some dozen persons of those most in the\r\nconfidence of the Empress. The Grand Duke, not content with enjoying the\r\nfruit of his skilful labour himself, must needs call all who were about\r\nhim to share in the pleasure of looking through the holes which he had\r\nbored with so much diligence. When all were fully satisfied with this\r\nindiscreet pleasure, he came and invited Madame Krause, myself, and my\r\nmaids, to go to his room and see something which we had never seen\r\nbefore. He did not tell us what it was, doubtless to give us an\r\nagreeable surprise. As I did not hurry myself sufficiently to gratify\r\nhis impatience, he led away Madame Krause and my women. I arrived last,\r\nand found them stationed in front of this door, where he had placed\r\nbenches, chairs, and stools, for the accommodation of the spectators, as\r\nhe said. On entering, I asked what all this was about. He ran to meet\r\nme, and told me what the case was. I was terrified and indignant at his\r\nrashness, and told him I would neither look nor have anything to do with\r\nthis impropriety, which would certainly bring him into trouble if his\r\naunt should come to hear of it, and this she could not well help doing,\r\nseeing that there were at least twenty persons in his secret. All who\r\nhad allowed themselves to look through the door, finding that I would\r\nnot do the same, began to file off one after the other. The Duke himself\r\nbecame ashamed of what he had done, and recommenced working on his\r\ntheatre. I returned to my room.\r\n\r\nUp to the Sunday, we heard nothing of this affair; but on that day it\r\nhappened, I hardly know how, that I got to mass rather later than usual.\r\nOn returning to my room, I was about taking off my court dress, when I\r\nsaw the Empress enter with a flushed and angry look. As she had not been\r\nat the chapel mass, but had heard mass in her private oratory, I went to\r\nmeet her, to kiss her hand as usual, as I had not seen her before that\r\nday. She kissed me, desired the Grand Duke to be sent for, and, while\r\nwaiting for him, scolded me for being late at mass, and preferring my\r\nown adornment to the service of God. She added that in the time of the\r\nEmpress Anne, though not living at court, but in a house at some\r\ndistance from the palace, she had never failed in her duties, but often\r\ngot up by candle-light for this purpose. Then she sent for the valet de\r\nchambre who dressed my hair, and told him that for the future, if he was\r\nso slow in dressing my hair, she would have him dismissed. When she had\r\nended with him, the Grand Duke, who had undressed in his own room,\r\nentered in his dressing-gown, with his night cap in his hand, and with a\r\ngay and careless air. He ran to kiss the hand of the Empress, who\r\nembraced him, and then asked him how he had dared to act in the manner\r\nhe had done, adding that she had gone into the room which contained the\r\nmechanical table, and found the door all pierced with holes, all these\r\nholes being directed towards the place where she usually sat; that he\r\nseemed to have forgotten what he owed her; that she could no longer\r\nconsider him as anything but an ungrateful person; that her father,\r\nPeter I., had also an ungrateful son, and that he punished him by\r\ndisinheriting him; that, in the time of the Empress Anne, she had never\r\nfailed in giving her the respect due to a crowned head, anointed of the\r\nLord; that the Empress Anne did not understand jokes, but sent to the\r\nFortress those who were wanting in respect; that as for him, he was but\r\na little boy, and she would teach him how to behave. At this he began\r\nto get angry, and would have answered her, stammering out a few words to\r\nthis effect, but she commanded him to be silent, and became so excited\r\nthat her anger knew no bounds, as was usually the case when she got into\r\na passion. She loaded him with insults, and said all sorts of shocking\r\nthings, treating him with as much contempt as anger.\r\n\r\nWe were thunderstruck, and although this scene did not refer directly to\r\nme, yet tears came into my eyes. She perceived this, and said to me,\r\n\"This does not apply to you; I know that you had nothing to do with this\r\nact, and that you neither looked nor wished to look through the door.\"\r\nThis remark, which was correct, calmed her a little, and she stopped;\r\nbesides, it would have been difficult for her to have gone farther than\r\nshe had done. She then wished us good morning, and retired, with a\r\nflushed face and flashing eyes. The Grand Duke went to his room, and I\r\nundressed in silence, ruminating on what I had heard. When I had done,\r\nthe Duke returned, and said to me--in a tone half sheepish, half\r\ncomical--\"She was like a fury, and did not know what she said.\" \"She was\r\ndreadfully angry,\" I replied. We talked over the matter, and then dined\r\nin my room, quite alone. When the Grand Duke had gone to his own\r\napartments, Madame Krause entered my room. \"It must be acknowledged,\"\r\nshe said, \"that the Empress has acted like a true mother to-day.\" I saw\r\nshe wished to make me talk, and therefore I said nothing. She continued:\r\n\"A mother gets angry, scolds her children, and there the matter ends;\r\nyou ought both of you to have said to her, _I beg your pardon, Madame_,\r\nand you would have disarmed her.\" I said I was astounded and petrified\r\nby her Majesty's anger, and all I could do at the moment was to listen\r\nand be silent. She then left me, probably to make her report. As for me,\r\nthe \"_I beg your pardon, Madame_,\" as a means of disarming the anger of\r\nthe Empress, remained in my head; and I have since used it with success,\r\nwhen occasion required, as will be seen in the sequel.\r\n\r\nSome time before the Empress had relieved Count Brummer and the Great\r\nChamberlain from attendance on the Grand Duke, I happened one day to go\r\nearlier than usual into the ante-chamber. The Count was there alone, and\r\nseized the occasion to speak to me. He begged and entreated me to go\r\nevery day to the Empress' dressing-room, as my mother, at leaving, had\r\nobtained permission for me to do; a privilege of which I had made very\r\nlittle use hitherto, as it was a prerogative which wearied me\r\nexcessively. I had gone once or twice, and found there the Empress'\r\nwomen, who retired by degrees, so that I was left alone. I told him\r\nthis. He said it was of no consequence, I ought to continue. But I could\r\nnot understand this courtier-like perseverance. It might answer his\r\nviews, but it did not at all suit me to be kept standing in the Empress'\r\ndressing-room, and be, besides, an inconvenience to her. I stated to him\r\nmy repugnance, but he did everything to persuade me, though without\r\nsuccess. I was much better pleased to be in my own rooms, especially\r\nwhen Madame Krause was not there. I had discovered in her this winter a\r\nvery decided propensity for drink, and as she soon after got her\r\ndaughter married to the Marshal of the Court, Sievers, she either was\r\nout a good deal, or my people contrived to make her tipsy, when she went\r\nto sleep, and my room was delivered from this surly Argus.\r\n\r\nCount Brummer and the Grand Chamberlain Berkholz having been relieved\r\nfrom their duties about the Prince, the Empress named as his attendant\r\nGeneral Prince Basil Repnine. A better appointment could not have been\r\nmade, for Prince Repnine was not only a man of honour and probity, he\r\nwas also a man of talent, a very worthy man, candid and straightforward.\r\nFor my own-self, I had every reason to be satisfied with the conduct of\r\nPrince Repnine. For Count Brummer I felt no regret; he wearied me with\r\nhis eternal politics, he smelt of intrigue; while the frank and\r\nsoldier-like character of Prince Repnine inspired me with confidence. As\r\nfor the Grand Duke, he was delighted to get rid of his pedagogues, whom\r\nhe hated. In quitting him, however, they left him with no slight anxiety\r\nat finding himself at the mercy of the intrigues of Count Bestoujeff,\r\nwho was the prime mover in all these changes, made under the plausible\r\npretext of the majority of his Imperial Highness in his duchy of\r\nHolstein. Prince Augustus, my uncle, was still at St. Petersburg,\r\nwatching the administration of the Grand Duke's hereditary territory.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May we moved to the Summer Palace. At the end of the\r\nmonth the Empress placed with me, as chief housekeeper, Madame\r\nTchoglokoff, one of her maids of honour, and her relative. This was a\r\nthunderbolt for me. This lady was altogether in the interest of Count\r\nBestoujeff, extremely silly, spiteful, capricious, and very selfish. Her\r\nhusband, Chamberlain to the Empress, was then gone on some sort of\r\nmission from her Majesty to Vienna. I wept a great deal on seeing her\r\narrive, and all the rest of the day. I was to be bled on the following\r\nday. In the morning the Empress came to my room, and seeing my eyes red,\r\nsaid to me that young women who did not love their husbands were always\r\ncrying; that my mother, however, had assured her I had no repugnance to\r\nmarrying the Grand Duke; that, besides, she had not forced me; that, as\r\nI was married, I must not cry any more. I remembered the instructions of\r\nMadame Krause, and said to her, _I beg your pardon, Madame_, and she was\r\nappeased. Meanwhile the Grand Duke came in, and this time the Empress\r\nreceived him very graciously, and then went away. I was bled, and indeed\r\nI required it; I then went to bed, and wept the whole day. The next day,\r\nthe Grand Duke drew me aside in the course of the afternoon, and I saw\r\nclearly that they had given him to understand that Madame Tchoglokoff\r\nhad been placed with me because I did not love him. But I cannot\r\nunderstand how they expected to increase my attachment for him by giving\r\nme that woman; and so I told him. As to placing her with me as an Argus,\r\nthat was a different matter. But if this was their object, they ought to\r\nhave chosen some one less stupid; and, besides, it was not necessary for\r\nthis purpose to be spiteful and malevolent. Madame Tchoglokoff was\r\nthought to be extremely virtuous, because she loved her husband to\r\nadoration. She had married him for love: so excellent an example placed\r\nbefore me would perhaps persuade me to imitate it. We shall see how far\r\nthe experiment was successful. In all probability, it was the\r\ncircumstance which I am about to relate which precipitated this\r\narrangement. I say precipitated, because I believe that, from the\r\nbeginning, Count Bestoujeff had it in view to surround us with his\r\ncreatures. He would gladly have done the same in the case of the Empress\r\nalso, but that was not so easy.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke, at the time I arrived in Moscow, had in his service\r\nthree domestics named Czernicheff, all three sons of grenadiers in the\r\nbodyguard of the Empress. Their fathers held the rank of lieutenant,\r\nwhich they received as a recompense for having aided in placing the\r\nEmpress on the throne. The oldest of the Czernicheffs was cousin to the\r\ntwo others, who were brothers. The Grand Duke was very fond of all\r\nthree. They were the persons most in his confidence, and were really\r\nvery useful. All three were tall and well made, especially the oldest.\r\nThe Duke made use of him in all his commissions, and several times in\r\nthe day he sent him to me. He it was, too, whom the Duke made his\r\nconfidant when he did not care to come to me. This man was on very\r\nintimate and friendly terms with my valet Yevreinoff, and through this\r\nchannel I often knew things which I should otherwise have been ignorant\r\nof. Besides, both of them were attached to me heart and soul, and I\r\noften obtained information from them, on a variety of matters, which it\r\nwould have been difficult to have procured otherwise. I do not know in\r\nreference to what it was that the oldest of the Czernicheffs said one\r\nday to the Grand Duke, \"she is not my intended, but yours.\" This\r\nexpression made the Grand Duke laugh. He related it to me, and from that\r\ntime it pleased his Imperial Highness, when speaking to me, to call me\r\nhis intended, and Andrew Czernicheff your intended. After our marriage\r\nAndrew Czernicheff, to put a stop to this badinage, proposed to his\r\nImperial Highness to call me his mother, and I, on my part, called him\r\nmy son. Now between the Grand Duke and myself there was always some\r\nreference to this son, for he was excessively attached to the man; and I\r\nalso liked him very much.\r\n\r\nMy servants were greatly disturbed on this account; some through\r\njealousy, others from apprehension of the consequences which might\r\nresult both for them and for us. One day when there was a masked ball at\r\ncourt, and I had gone to my room to change my dress, my valet Timothy\r\nYevreinoff took me aside, and told me that he and all my servants were\r\nterrified at the danger into which he saw me plunging. I asked him what\r\nhe meant. He said, \"You speak of nothing and think of nothing but Andrew\r\nCzernicheff.\" \"Well,\" I said, in the innocence of my heart, \"what harm\r\nis there in that? He is my son. The Grand Duke likes him as much and\r\nmore than I do; and he is devoted and faithful to us.\" \"Yes,\" he\r\nreplied, \"that is all very true; the Grand Duke can do as he pleases;\r\nbut you have not the same right. What you call kindness and attachment,\r\nbecause this man is faithful and serves you, your people call love.\" The\r\nutterance of this word, which had never once occurred to me, was a\r\nthunderbolt; first, on account of the opinion of my servants, which I\r\ncalled rash; secondly, on account of the condition in which I had placed\r\nmyself, without being aware of it. He told me that he had advised his\r\nfriend Czernicheff to pretend illness in order to put an end to these\r\nremarks. This advice Czernicheff followed, and his feigned illness\r\nlasted pretty nearly to the month of April. The Grand Duke was much\r\nconcerned about him, and spoke of him continually to me. He had not the\r\nslightest suspicion of the real circumstances. At the Summer Palace\r\nAndrew Czernicheff again made his appearance. I could no longer meet him\r\nwithout embarrassment. Meanwhile the Empress had thought proper to make\r\na new arrangement with the servants of the court. They were to serve in\r\nturn in all the rooms, and Andrew Czernicheff like the rest. The Grand\r\nDuke often had concerts in the afternoon, and he himself played the\r\nviolin at them. During one of these concerts, which usually wearied me,\r\nI went to my own room. This opened into the great hall of the Summer\r\nPalace, which was then filled with scaffoldings, as they were painting\r\nthe ceiling. The Empress was absent; Madame Krause had gone to her\r\ndaughter's, Madame Sievers; and I did not find a soul in my room. From\r\n_ennui_ I opened the door of the hall, and saw at the other end Andrew\r\nCzernicheff. I made a sign to him to approach; he came to the door,\r\nthough with much apprehension. I asked him if the Empress would return\r\nsoon. He said, \"I cannot speak to you; they make too much noise in the\r\nhall; let me come into your room.\" I replied, \"That I will not do.\" He\r\nwas outside the door and I within, holding the door half open as I spoke\r\nto him. An involuntary impulse made me turn my head in the direction\r\nopposite to the door at which I stood, and I saw behind me at the other\r\ndoor of my dressing-room, the Chamberlain, Count Divier, who said to me,\r\n\"The Grand Duke wishes to see you, madam.\" I closed the door of the\r\nhall, and returned with Count Divier to the apartment where the Grand\r\nDuke was giving his concert. I have since learnt that Count Divier was a\r\nkind of reporter employed as such, like many others about me. The\r\nfollowing day, which was Sunday, after mass, we learnt--that is, the\r\nGrand Duke and I--that the three Czernicheffs had been placed as\r\nlieutenants in the regiments stationed near Orenburg; and in the\r\nafternoon of this day Madame Tchoglokoff was placed with me.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, we received orders to prepare to accompany the\r\nEmpress to Reval. At the same time, Madame Tchoglokoff told me from her\r\nMajesty that, for the future, her Imperial Majesty would dispense with\r\nmy coming to her dressing-room, and that if I had any communication to\r\nmake to her it must not be made through any one but Madame Tchoglokoff.\r\nIn my own mind, I was delighted with this order, which relieved me from\r\nthe necessity of being kept standing among the Empress' women; besides,\r\nI seldom went to her dressing-room, and then but rarely saw her. During\r\nthe whole time that I had been going there I had not seen her more than\r\nthree or four times, and, generally speaking, whenever I went, her women\r\nquitted the room one after the other. Not to be left there alone, I\r\nseldom stayed long either.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June the Empress set out for Reval, and we accompanied\r\nher. The Grand Duke and I travelled in a carriage for four persons;\r\nPrince Augustus and Madame Tchoglokoff made up its complement. Our plan\r\nof travelling was neither agreeable nor convenient. The post-houses or\r\nstations were occupied by the Empress; we were accommodated in tents or\r\nin the outhouses. I remember that on one occasion, during this journey,\r\nI dressed near the oven where the bread had just been baked; and that\r\nanother time, when I entered the tent where my bed was placed, there was\r\nwater in it up to the ankle. Besides all this, the Empress had no fixed\r\nhour, either for setting out or stopping, for meals or repose. We were\r\nall, masters and servants, strangely harassed.\r\n\r\nAfter ten or twelve days' march, we reached an estate belonging to Count\r\nSteinbock, forty verstes from Reval. From this place the Empress\r\ndeparted in great state, wishing to reach Catherinthal in the evening;\r\nbut somehow it happened that the journey was prolonged till half-past\r\none in the morning.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire journey, from St. Petersburg to Reval, Madame\r\nTchoglokoff was the torment of our carriage. To the simplest thing that\r\nwas said, she would reply, \"Such a remark would displease her Majesty;\"\r\nor, \"Such a thing would not be approved of by her Majesty.\" It was\r\nsometimes to the most innocent and indifferent matters that she\r\nattached these etiquettes. As for me, I made up my mind, and during the\r\nwhole journey slept continually while in the carriage.\r\n\r\nFrom the day after our arrival at Catherinthal, the court recommenced\r\nits ordinary round of occupations; that is to say, from morning till\r\nnight, and far into the night, gambling, and for rather high stakes, was\r\ncarried on in the ante-chamber of the Empress, a hall which divided the\r\nhouse and its two stories into two sections.\r\n\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff was a gambler; she induced me to play at faro like\r\nthe rest. All the favourites of the Empress were ordinarily fixed here\r\nwhen they did not happen to be in her Majesty's room, or rather tent,\r\nfor she had erected a very large and magnificent tent at the side of her\r\napartments, which were on the ground floor, and very small, as was\r\nusually the case with the structures of Peter I. He had built this\r\ncountry residence, and planted the garden.\r\n\r\nThe Prince and Princess Repnine, who were of the party, and were aware\r\nof the arrogant and senseless conduct of Madame Tchoglokoff during the\r\njourney, persuaded me to speak of it to the Countess Schouvaloff and\r\nMadame Ismaïloff, the ladies most in her Majesty's favour. These ladies\r\nhad no love for Madame Tchoglokoff, and they had already learnt what had\r\nhappened. The little Countess Schouvaloff, who was indiscretion itself,\r\ndid not wait for me to speak to her, but happening to be seated by my\r\nside at play, she introduced the subject herself, and, being very\r\nhumorous, she placed the whole conduct of Madame Tchoglokoff in such a\r\nridiculous light, that she soon made her the laughing-stock of every\r\none. She did more; she related to the Empress all that had passed. It\r\nwould seem as if Madame Tchoglokoff had received a reproof, for she\r\nlowered her tone very considerably with me. Indeed, there was much need\r\nof this being done, for I began to feel a great tendency to melancholy.\r\nI felt totally isolated. The Grand Duke, at Reval, took a passing fancy\r\nfor a Madame Cédéraparre. As usual, he did not fail to confide the\r\nmatter to me immediately. I had frequent pains in the chest, and at\r\nCatherinthal a spitting of blood, for which I was bled. On the afternoon\r\nof that day, Madame Tchoglokoff came to my room, and found me in tears.\r\nWith a countenance greatly softened, she asked me what was the matter,\r\nand proposed to me, on the part of the Empress, to take a walk in the\r\ngarden, to dissipate my hopochondria, as she said. That day the Grand\r\nDuke had gone to hunt with the Master of the Hounds, Count Razoumowsky.\r\nShe also placed in my hands, as a present from her Imperial Majesty,\r\n3000 roubles, for playing at faro. The ladies had noticed that I was\r\nwithout money, and told the Empress. I begged Madame Tchoglokoff to\r\nthank her Majesty for her goodness, and then went with her for a walk in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nSome days after our arrival at Catherinthal, the High Chancellor, Count\r\nBestoujeff, arrived, accompanied by the Imperial Ambassador, the Baron\r\nPreyslain, and we learned, by the tenor of his congratulations, that the\r\ntwo imperial courts had just become united by a treaty of alliance. In\r\nconsequence of this, the Empress went to see her fleet manoeuvre; but,\r\nexcept the smoke of the cannons, we saw nothing. The day was excessively\r\nhot, and the sea perfectly calm. On returning from this manoeuvre,\r\nthere was a ball in the Empress' tents, which were erected on the\r\nterrace. The supper was spread in the open air, around a basin intended\r\nfor a fountain; but scarcely had her Majesty taken her seat, when there\r\ncame on a shower which wetted the entire company, forcing it to\r\ndisperse and seek shelter, as best it could, in the houses and in the\r\ntents. Thus ended this _fête_.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards the Empress departed for Roguervick. The fleet\r\nmanoeuvred there also, and again we saw nothing but smoke. In this\r\njourney we all suffered very much in our feet. The soil of the place is\r\na rock, covered with a thick bed of pebbles, of such a nature that if\r\none stood for a short time in the same spot, the feet would sink in and\r\nthe pebbles cover them. We encamped here for several days, and were\r\nforced to walk, in passing from tent to tent, and in our tents, upon\r\nthis ground. For more than four months afterwards my feet were sore in\r\nconsequence. The convicts who worked at the pier wore sabots, and even\r\nthese seldom lasted beyond eight or ten days.\r\n\r\nThe imperial ambassador had followed her Majesty to this port. He dined\r\nthere and supped with her half-way between Roguervick and Reval. During\r\nthis supper an old woman, who had reached the age of 130 years, was led\r\nbefore the Empress. She looked like a walking skeleton. The Empress sent\r\nher meat from her own table, as well as money, and we continued our\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Catherinthal, Madame Tchoglokoff had the satisfaction\r\nof finding there her husband, who had returned from his mission to\r\nVienna. Many of the court equipages had already taken the road for Riga,\r\nwhither the Empress intended to go. But on her return from Roguervick\r\nshe suddenly changed her mind. Many people tormented their brains, in\r\nvain, to discover the cause of this change. Several years afterwards it\r\ncame to light. When M. Tchoglokoff was passing through Riga, a Lutheran\r\npriest, a madman or a fanatic, placed in his hands a letter and a\r\nmemorial addressed to the Empress, in which he exhorted her not to\r\nundertake this journey, as if she did she would incur the most imminent\r\nrisk; that there were people posted in ambush by the enemies of the\r\nempire for the purpose of killing her, and such like absurdities. These\r\nwritings, being delivered to the Empress, left her in no humour for\r\ntravelling farther. As for the priest, he was found to be mad; but the\r\njourney did not take place.\r\n\r\nWe returned by short stages from Reval to St. Petersburg. I caught in\r\nthis journey a severe sore throat, which compelled me to keep my bed for\r\nseveral days; after which we went to Peterhoff, and thence made weekly\r\nexcursions to Oranienbaum.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of August the Empress sent word to the Grand Duke and\r\nmyself that we ought to go to our duty. We both complied with her\r\nwishes, and immediately began to have matins and vespers sung in our\r\napartments, and to go to mass every day. On the Friday, when we were to\r\ngo to confession, the cause of this order became apparent. Simon\r\nTheodorsky, Bishop of Pleskov, questioned us both a great deal, and each\r\nseparately, respecting what had passed between the Czernicheffs and us.\r\nBut as nothing whatever had passed, he looked a little foolish when he\r\nheard it asserted, with the candour of innocence, that there was not\r\neven the shadow of what people had dared to suppose. He was so far\r\nthrown off his guard as to say to me, \"But how then is it that the\r\nEmpress has been impressed to the contrary?\" To which I replied, that I\r\nreally did not know. I suppose our confessor communicated our confession\r\nto the Empress' confessor, and that the latter retailed it to her\r\nMajesty--a thing which certainly could do us no harm. We communicated\r\non the Saturday, and on the Monday went for a week to Oranienbaum, while\r\nthe Empress made an excursion to Zarskoe-Selo.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Oranienbaum the Grand Duke enlisted all his suite. The\r\nchamberlains, the gentlemen of the bed-chamber, the officers of the\r\ncourt, the adjutants of Prince Repnine, and even his son, the servants,\r\nthe huntsmen, the gardeners, every one, in fact, had to shoulder his\r\nmusket. His Imperial Highness exercised them every day, and made them\r\nmount guard, the corridor of the house serving as a guard-room, and here\r\nthey passed the day. For their meals the gentlemen went up stairs, and\r\nin the evening they came into the hall to dance in gaiters. As for\r\nladies there were only myself, Madame Tchoglokoff, the Princess Repnine,\r\nmy three maids of honour, and my lady's-maids; consequently the ball was\r\nvery meagre and badly managed, the men harassed and in bad humour with\r\nthese continual military exercises, which did not suit the taste of\r\ncourtiers. After the ball they were allowed to go home to sleep.\r\nGenerally speaking, we were all dreadfully tired of the dull life we led\r\nat Oranienbaum, where we were, five or six women, all to ourselves;\r\nwhile the men, on their side, were engaged in unwilling exercises. I had\r\nrecourse to the books I had brought with me. Since my marriage I read a\r\ngreat deal. The first book I read after my marriage was a novel called\r\nTiran the Fair (Tiran le blanc), and for a whole year I read nothing but\r\nnovels. But I began to tire of these. I stumbled by accident upon the\r\nletters of Madame de Sévigné, and was much interested by them. When I\r\nhad devoured these, the works of Voltaire fell into my hands. After\r\nreading them, I selected my books with more care.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Peterhoff, and after two or three journeys backwards and\r\nforwards, between that place and Oranienbaum, with the same amusements,\r\nwe finally got back to St. Petersburg, and took up our residence in the\r\nSummer Palace.\r\n\r\nAt the close of autumn the Empress passed to the Winter Palace, where\r\nshe occupied our apartments of the previous year; while we moved into\r\nthose occupied by the Grand Duke before our marriage. These we liked\r\nvery much, and, indeed, they were very convenient. They were those used\r\nby the Empress Anne. Every evening the members of our court assembled in\r\nour apartments, and we amused ourselves with all kinds of small games,\r\nor we had a concert. Twice a-week there was a performance at the great\r\ntheatre, which at that time was opposite the church of Kasan. In a word,\r\nthis winter was one of the gayest and best managed I have ever spent. We\r\nliterally did nothing but laugh and romp the whole day.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the winter, the Empress sent us word to follow her\r\nto Tichvine, where she was going. It was a journey of devotion; but just\r\nas we were about to enter our sledges, we learnt that the journey was\r\nput off. It was whispered to us that the Master of the Hounds, Count\r\nRazoumowsky, had got a fit of the gout, and that her Majesty did not\r\nwish to go without him. About two or three weeks afterwards we did\r\nstart. The journey lasted only five days, when we returned. In passing\r\nthrough Ribatchia Slobodk, and by the house where I knew the\r\nCzernicheffs were, I tried to see them through the windows, but I could\r\nsee nothing. Prince Repnine was not in the party during this journey; we\r\nwere told that he had the gravel. The husband of Madame Tchoglokoff took\r\nhis place on the occasion, and this was not the most agreeable\r\narrangement in the world for most of us. He was an arrogant and brutal\r\nfool; everybody feared him, and his wife as well; and indeed, they were\r\nboth mischievous and dangerous characters. However, there were means, as\r\nwill be seen in the sequel, not only of lulling these Arguses to sleep,\r\nbut even of gaining them over. At that time these means had not been\r\ndiscovered. One of the surest was to play at faro with them; they were\r\nboth eager players, and very selfish ones. This weak point was the one\r\nfirst perceived; the others came afterwards.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter, the Princess Gagarine, maid of honour, died of a\r\nburning fever, just as she was to be married to the Chamberlain Prince\r\nGalitzine, who subsequently married her younger sister. I regretted her\r\nvery much, and during her illness I went several times to see her,\r\nnotwithstanding the representations of Madame Tchoglokoff. The Empress\r\nreplaced her by her elder sister, since married to count Matiuschkine.\r\nShe was then at Moscow, and was sent for accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, we went to the Summer Palace, and thence to the country.\r\nPrince Repnine, under the pretext of bad health, received permission to\r\nretire to his own house, and M. Tchoglokoff continued to discharge his\r\nfunctions in the interim. He first signalized himself by the dismissal\r\nfrom our court of Count Divier, who was placed as brigadier in the army,\r\nand of the Gentleman of the Bedchamber Villebois, who was sent there as\r\ncolonel. These changes were made at the instigation of Tchoglokoff, who\r\nlooked on both with an evil eye, because he saw that we thought well of\r\nthem. A similar dismissal had taken place in 1745, in the case of Count\r\nZachar Czernicheff, sent away at the request of my mother. Still these\r\nremovals were always considered at court as disgraces, and they were\r\ntherefore sensibly felt by the individuals. The Grand Duke and myself\r\nwere much annoyed with this latter one. Prince Augustus, too, having\r\nobtained all he had asked for, was told from the Empress that he must\r\nnow leave. This also was a manoeuvre of the Tchoglokoffs, who were\r\nbent upon completely isolating us. In this they followed the\r\ninstructions of Count Bestoujeff, who was suspicious of everybody.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer, having nothing better to do, and everything being\r\nvery dull at home, I took a passion for riding; the rest of my time I\r\nspent in my room, reading everything that came in my way. As for the\r\nGrand Duke, as they had taken from him the people he liked best, he\r\nchose other favourites among the servants of the court.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval, my valet Yevreinoff, while dressing my hair one\r\nday, told me that by a strange accident he had discovered that Andrew\r\nCzernicheff and his brothers were at Ribatchia, under arrest, in a\r\npleasure-house, which was the private property of the Empress, who had\r\ninherited it from her mother. It was thus that the discovery was\r\nmade:--During the carnival, Yevreinoff went out for a drive, having his\r\nwife and sister-in-law with him in the sledge, and the two\r\nbrothers-in-law behind. The sister's husband was secretary to the\r\nMagistrate of St. Petersburg, and had a sister married to an\r\nunder-secretary of the secret Chancery. They went for a walk one day to\r\nRibatchia, and called on the man who had charge of this estate of the\r\nEmpress. A dispute arose about the Feast of Easter, as to what day it\r\nwould fall on. The host said that he would soon end the controversy by\r\nasking the prisoners for a book called Swiatzj, which contained all the\r\nFeasts, together with the calendar, for several years. In a few minutes\r\nhe brought it in. The brother-in-law of Yevreinoff took the book, and\r\nthe first thing he saw, on opening it, was that Andrew Czernicheff had\r\nput his name in it, with the date of the day on which he had received it\r\nfrom the Grand Duke. After this he looked for the Feast of Easter. The\r\ndispute being ended, the book was sent back, and they returned to St.\r\nPetersburg, where some days later, the brother-in-law of Yevreinoff\r\nconfided to him the discovery he had made. Yevreinoff entreated me not\r\nto mention the matter to the Grand Duke, as his discretion was not at\r\nall to be relied on. I promised him that I would not, and kept my word.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of Lent, we went with the Empress to Gostilitza, to\r\ncelebrate the feast-day of the Master of the Hounds, Count Razoumowsky.\r\nWe danced, and were tolerably well amused, and then returned to town.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, the death of my father was announced to me. It\r\ngreatly afflicted me. For a week I was allowed to weep as much as I\r\npleased, but at the end of that time, Madame Tchoglokoff came to tell me\r\nthat I had wept enough; that the Empress ordered me to leave off; that\r\nmy father was not a king. I told her I knew that he was not a king, and\r\nshe replied that it was not suitable for a Grand Duchess to mourn for a\r\nlonger period a father who had not been a king. In fine, it was arranged\r\nthat I should go out on the following Sunday, and wear mourning for six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThe first day I left my room, I found Count Santi, Grand Master of\r\nCeremonies to the Empress, in her Majesty's ante-chamber. I addressed a\r\nfew casual remarks to him, and passed on. Some days later, Madame\r\nTchoglokoff came to tell me that her Majesty had learned from Count\r\nBestoujeff--to whom Santi had given the information in writing--that I\r\nhad told him (Santi) I thought it very strange that the ambassadors had\r\nnot offered their condolences to me on the occasion of my father's\r\ndeath; that her Majesty considered my remarks to Count Santi very\r\nuncalled for; that I was too proud; that I ought to remember that my\r\nfather was not a king, and therefore that I could not and must not\r\nexpect to receive the condolences of the foreign ministers. I was\r\nastounded at this speech. I told Madame Tchoglokoff that, if Count Santi\r\nhad said or written that I had spoken to him a single word having the\r\nleast allusion to this subject, he was a notorious liar; that nothing of\r\nthe kind had ever entered my mind; and therefore that I had not uttered\r\na syllable to him or any one else in reference to it. This was the exact\r\ntruth, for I had laid it down to myself as an invariable rule never, in\r\nany case, to make any pretensions, but to conform in everything to the\r\nwishes of the Empress, and fulfil all her commands. It would seem that\r\nthe ingenuousness with which I replied to Madame Tchoglokoff carried\r\nconviction to her mind, for she said she would not fail to tell the\r\nEmpress that I gave the lie to Count Santi. In fact, she went to her\r\nMajesty, and came back to tell me that the Empress was extremely angry\r\nwith Count Santi for having uttered such a falsehood, and that she had\r\nordered him to be reprimanded. Some days afterwards, the Count sent\r\nseveral persons to me, and among them the Chamberlain, Count Nikita\r\nPanine, and the Vice-Chancellor, Woronzoff, to tell me that Count\r\nBestoujeff had forced him to tell this falsehood, and that he was sorry\r\nto find himself in disgrace with me in consequence. I told these\r\ngentlemen that a liar was a liar, whatever might be his reasons for\r\nlying; and that, in order that Count Santi might not again mix me up\r\nwith his falsehoods, I should never speak to him. Here is what has\r\noccurred to me in reference to this matter: Santi was an Italian. He\r\nwas fond of intermeddling, and attached much importance to his office of\r\nGrand Master of Ceremonies. I had always spoken to him as I spoke to\r\nevery one else. He thought, perhaps, that compliments of condolence on\r\nthe part of the diplomatic corps might be admissible; and, judging by\r\nhis own feelings, he probably considered that this would be a means of\r\nobliging me. He went then to Count Bestoujeff, the High Chancellor, and\r\nhis superior, and told him that I had appeared in public for the first\r\ntime, and seemed very much affected; the omission of the condolences\r\nmight have added to my grief. Count Bestoujeff, always carping, and\r\ndelighted to have an opportunity of humbling me, had all that Santi said\r\nor insinuated--and which he had ventured to support with my name--put\r\ninto writing, and made him sign this protocol. Santi, terribly afraid of\r\nhis superior, and above all things dreading to lose his place, did not\r\nhesitate to sign a falsehood rather than sacrifice his means of\r\nexistence. The High Chancellor sent the note to the Empress. She was\r\nannoyed to see my pretensions, and despatched Madame Tchoglokoff to me,\r\nas already mentioned. But having heard my reply, founded upon the exact\r\ntruth, the only result was a slap in the face for his excellency the\r\nGrand Master of the Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nIn the country, the Grand Duke formed a pack of hounds, and began to\r\ntrain dogs himself. When tired of tormenting these, he set to work\r\nscraping on the violin. He did not know a note, but he had a good ear,\r\nand made the beauty of music consist in the force and violence with\r\nwhich he drew forth the tones of his instrument. Those who had to listen\r\nto him, however, would often have been glad to stop their ears had they\r\ndared, for his music grated on them dreadfully. This course of life\r\ncontinued not only in the country, but also in town. On returning to\r\nthe Winter Palace, Madame Krause--who had all along been an\r\nArgus--moderated so far as often even to aid in deceiving the\r\nTchoglokoffs, who were hated by every one. She did more: she procured\r\nfor the Grand Duke playthings--puppets, and such like childish toys, of\r\nwhich he was passionately fond. During the day, they were concealed\r\nwithin, or under my bed; the Grand Duke retired immediately after\r\nsupper, and as soon as we were in bed Madame Krause locked the door, and\r\nthen the Grand Duke played with his puppets till one or two o'clock in\r\nthe morning. Willing or unwilling, I was obliged to share in this\r\ninteresting amusement; and so was Madame Krause. I often laughed, but\r\nmore frequently felt annoyed, and even inconvenienced; the whole bed was\r\ncovered and filled with playthings, some of which were rather heavy. I\r\ndo not know whether Madame Tchoglokoff came to hear of these nocturnal\r\namusements, but one night, about twelve o'clock, she knocked at the door\r\nof our bed room. We did not open it immediately, as the Grand Duke,\r\nmyself, and Madame Krause were scrambling with all our might to gather\r\nup and conceal the toys: for this purpose the cover-lid of the bed\r\nanswered very well, as we crammed them all in under it. This done, we\r\nopened the door. She complained dreadfully of having been kept waiting,\r\nand told us that the Empress would be very angry when she learnt that we\r\nwere not asleep at that hour. She then sulkily departed, without having\r\nmade any further discovery. As soon as she was gone, the Duke resumed\r\nhis amusements until he became sleepy.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of autumn we again returned to the apartments which\r\nwe had occupied after our marriage, in the Winter Palace. Here, a very\r\nstringent order was issued by the Empress through M. Tchoglokoff,\r\nforbidding every one from entering either my apartments or those of the\r\nGrand Duke, without the express permission of M. and Madame Tchoglokoff.\r\nThe ladies and gentlemen of our court were directed, under pain of\r\ndismissal, to keep in the ante-chamber, and not to pass the threshold,\r\nor speak to us--or even to the servants--otherwise than aloud. The Grand\r\nDuke and myself, thus compelled to sit looking at each other, murmured,\r\nand secretly interchanged thoughts relative to this species of\r\nimprisonment, which neither of us had deserved. To procure for himself\r\nmore amusement during the winter, the Duke had five or six hounds\r\nbrought from the country, and placed them behind a wooden partition\r\nwhich separated the alcove of my bed-room from a large vestibule behind\r\nour apartments. As the alcove was separated only by boards, the odour of\r\nthe kennel penetrated into it; and in the midst of this disgusting smell\r\nwe both slept. When I complained to him of the inconvenience, he told me\r\nit was impossible to help it. The kennel being a great secret, I put up\r\nwith this nuisance, rather than betray his Imperial Highness.\r\n\r\nAs there was no kind of amusement at court during this carnival, the\r\nGrand Duke took it into his head to have masquerades in my room. He\r\ndressed his servants, mine, and my maids in masks, and made them dance\r\nin my bed-room. He himself played the violin, and danced as well. All\r\nthis continued far into the night. As for me, under different pretexts\r\nof headache or lassitude, I lay down on a couch, but always in a\r\nmasquerade dress, tired to death of the insipidity of these\r\n_bal-masqués_, which amused him infinitely. When Lent came on, four more\r\npersons were removed from attendance on him, three of them being pages,\r\nwhom he liked better than the others. These frequent dismissals affected\r\nhim; still he took no steps to prevent them, or he took them so clumsily\r\nthat they only tended to increase the evil.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter, we learnt that Prince Repnine, ill as he was, had\r\nbeen appointed to command the troops which were to be sent to Bohemia,\r\nin aid of the Empress-Queen Maria Theresa. This was a formal disgrace\r\nfor Prince Repnine. He went, and never returned, having died of grief in\r\nBohemia. It was the Princess Gagarine, my maid of honour, who gave me\r\nthe first intimation of this, notwithstanding all the prohibitions\r\nagainst allowing a word to reach us relative to what occurred in the\r\ncity or the court. This shows how useless are all such prohibitions.\r\nThere are too many persons interested in infringing them ever to allow\r\nof their being strictly enforced. All about us, even to the nearest\r\nrelatives of the Tchoglokoffs, interested themselves in diminishing the\r\nrigour of the kind of political imprisonment to which we were subjected.\r\nThere was no one, not even excepting Madame Tchoglokoff's own brother,\r\nCount Hendrikoff, who did not contrive to give us useful intimations;\r\nand many persons even made use of him to convey information to me, which\r\nhe was always ready to do with the frankness of a good and honest\r\nfellow. He ridiculed the stupidities and brutalities of his sister and\r\nbrother-in-law in such a manner that every one was at ease with him, and\r\nno one ever thought of distrusting him, for he never compromised any\r\none, nor had any person ever been disappointed in him. He was a man of\r\ncorrect but limited judgment, ill-bred, and very ignorant, but firm, and\r\nwithout any evil.\r\n\r\nDuring this same Lent, one day about noon, I went into the room where\r\nour ladies and gentlemen were assembled--the Tchoglokoffs had not yet\r\ncome--and in speaking first to one and then to another, I approached the\r\ndoor near which the Chamberlain Outzine was standing. In a low voice he\r\nturned the conversation to the subject of the dull life we led, and\r\nsaid, that notwithstanding all this, people contrived to prejudice us in\r\nthe mind of the Empress; that a few days before, her Imperial Majesty\r\nhad said at table that I was overwhelmed with debt; that every thing I\r\ndid bore the stamp of folly; that for all that I thought myself very\r\nclever--an opinion, however, in which no one else shared, for nobody was\r\ndeceived in me, my stupidity being patent to all; and therefore that it\r\nwas less necessary to mind what the Grand Duke did than what I did. He\r\nadded, with tears in his eyes, that he was ordered by the Empress to\r\ntell me all this, but he begged me not to let it be supposed that he had\r\ntold me of this order. I replied, that as to my stupidity it ought not\r\nto be objected to me as a fault, every one being just what God had made\r\nhim; that as to my debts it was not very surprising I should be in debt\r\nwhen, with an allowance of 30,000 roubles, my mother, at parting, left\r\nme to pay 6,000 roubles on her account, while the Countess Roumianzoff\r\nhad led me into innumerable expenses which she considered as\r\nindispensable; that Madame Tchoglokoff alone cost me this year 17,000\r\nroubles, and that he himself knew what infernal play one was constantly\r\nobliged to play with them; that he might say all this to those who had\r\nsent him; that for the rest, I was very sorry I had been prejudiced in\r\nthe opinion of her Imperial Majesty, to whom I had never failed in\r\nrespect, obedience, and deference, and that the more closely my conduct\r\nwas looked into the more would she be convinced of this. I promised him\r\nthe secrecy he asked for, and kept it. I do not know whether he\r\nreported what I told him, but I fancy he did, though I heard no more of\r\nthe matter, and did not care to renew a conversation so little\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of Lent, I took the measles. I could not make my\r\nappearance at Easter, but received the communion in my room, on the\r\nSaturday. During this illness, Madame Tchoglokoff, though far advanced\r\nin pregnancy, scarcely ever left me, and did all she could to amuse me.\r\nI had then a little Kalmuck girl, of whom I was very fond. She caught\r\nthe measles from me. After Easter, we went to the Summer Palace, and\r\nthence, at the end of May--for the Feast of the Ascension--to the\r\nresidence of the Count Razoumowsky, at Gostilitza. The Empress invited\r\nthere, on the 23rd of this month, the Ambassador of the Imperial Court,\r\nthe Baron Breitlack, who was about to leave for Vienna. He spent the\r\nevening there, and supped with the Empress. This supper was served at a\r\nvery late hour, and we returned to the cottage in which we were lodged\r\nafter sunrise. This cottage was of wood, placed on a slight elevation,\r\nand attached to the slides.[8] We had been pleased with the situation of\r\nthis cottage when we were here in the winter, for the fête of the Master\r\nof the Hounds; and, in order to gratify us, he had placed us in it on\r\nthe present occasion. It had two stories; the upper one consisted of a\r\nstaircase, a saloon, and three cabinets. In one of these we slept, the\r\nGrand Duke used another as a dressing-room, and Madame Krause occupied\r\nthe third. Below were lodged the Tchoglokoffs, my maids of honour, and\r\nmy lady's-maids. On our return from supper, every one retired to rest.\r\nAbout six o'clock in the morning, a sergeant in the guards, Levacheff,\r\narrived from Oranienbaum, to speak to Tchoglokoff relative to the\r\nbuildings which were in the course of erection there. Finding every one\r\nasleep in the house, he sat down by the sentinel, and heard certain\r\ncrackling noises, which excited his suspicions. The sentinel told him\r\nthat these cracklings had been several times renewed since he had been\r\non duty. Levacheff got up, and ran to the outside of the house. He saw\r\nthat large blocks of stone were detaching themselves from the lower\r\nportion. He ran and woke Tchoglokoff, telling him that the foundations\r\nof the house were giving way, and that he must try and get every one out\r\nof it. Tchoglokoff put on a dressing-gown, and ran up stairs; where,\r\nfinding the doors--which were of glass--locked, he burst them open. He\r\nthus reached our room, and drawing the curtains, desired us to get up as\r\nfast as possible and leave the house, as the foundations were giving\r\nway. The Grand Duke leaped out of bed, seized his dressing-gown, and ran\r\noff. I told Tchoglokoff that I would follow him, and he left me. While\r\ndressing I recollected that Madame Krause slept in the next room, and\r\nwent to call her. She was so sound asleep that I had much difficulty in\r\nwaking her, and then in making her understand that she must leave the\r\nhouse. I helped her to dress. When she was in a condition to go out, we\r\npassed into the drawing-room; but we had scarcely done so, when there\r\nwas a universal crash, accompanied by a noise like that made by a vessel\r\nlaunched from the docks. We both fell on the ground. At the moment of\r\nour fall, Levacheff entered by the staircase door, which was opposite\r\nus. He raised me up, and carried me out of the room. I accidentally cast\r\nmy eyes towards the slides: they had been on a level with the second\r\nstory; they were so no longer but some two or three feet below it.\r\nLevacheff reached with me as far as the stairs by which he had ascended;\r\nthey were no longer to be found, they had fallen; but several persons\r\nhaving climbed upon the wreck, Levacheff passed me to the nearest, these\r\nto the others, and thus from hand to hand I reached the bottom of the\r\nstaircase in the hall, and thence was carried into a field. I there\r\nfound the Grand Duke in his dressing-gown.\r\n\r\nOnce out of the house, I directed my attention to what was passing\r\nthere, and saw several persons coming out of it all bloody, while others\r\nwere carried out. Amongst those most severely wounded was the Princess\r\nGagarine, my maid of honour. She had tried to escape like the rest, but\r\nin passing through a room adjoining her own, a stove, which fell down,\r\noverturned a screen, by which she was thrown upon a bed, which was in\r\nthe room. Several bricks fell upon her head, and wounded her severely,\r\nas they did also a girl who was with her. In this same story there was a\r\nsmall kitchen, in which several servants slept, three of whom were\r\nkilled by the fall of the fire-place. This, however, was nothing\r\ncompared with what occurred between the foundations and the ground\r\nfloor. Sixteen workmen attached to the slides slept there, and all of\r\nthem were crushed to death by the fall of the house. All this mischief\r\narose from the house having been built in the autumn, and in a hurry.\r\nThey had given it as a foundation four layers of limestone. In the lower\r\nstory the architect had placed, in the vestibule, twelve beams, which\r\nserved as pillars. He had to go to the Ukraine, and at his departure\r\ntold the manager of the estate of Gostilitza not to allow any one to\r\ntouch those beams till his return. Yet, notwithstanding this\r\nprohibition, when the manager learnt we were to occupy this cottage,\r\nnothing would do but he must immediately remove these beams, because\r\nthey disfigured the vestibule. Then, when the thaw came, everything sank\r\nupon the four layers of limestone, which gave way in different\r\ndirections, and the entire building slid towards a hillock, which\r\narrested its progress. I escaped with a few slight bruises and a great\r\nfright, for which I was bled. This fright was so general and so great\r\namongst us all, that for more than four months afterwards, if a door was\r\nonly slammed with a little extra force, every one started. On the day of\r\nthe accident, when the first terror had passed, the Empress, who\r\noccupied another house, sent for us, and, as she wished to make light of\r\nthe danger we had been in, every one tried to see little in it, and some\r\nnone at all. My terror displeased her very much, and she was out of\r\nhumour with me. The Master of the Hounds wept, and was inconsolable; he\r\ntalked of blowing out his brains. I presume he was prevented, for he did\r\nnothing of the kind, and the next day we returned to St. Petersburg, and\r\nsome weeks later to the Summer Palace.\r\n\r\nI do not exactly remember, but I fancy it was about this time that the\r\nChevalier Sacromoso arrived in Russia. It was a long time since a Knight\r\nof Malta had visited this country, and, generally speaking, few persons\r\ncame to St. Petersburg in those days; his arrival, therefore, was a sort\r\nof event. He was received with marked attention, and was shown\r\neverything worthy of note in St. Petersburg and Cronstadt. A naval\r\nofficer of distinction was appointed to accompany him. This was M.\r\nPoliansky, then captain of a man-of-war, since an admiral. He was\r\npresented to us. In kissing my hand he slipped into it a very small\r\nnote, saying at the same time, in a low voice, \"It is from your\r\nmother.\" I was almost stupefied with terror at this act. I dreaded its\r\nbeing observed by some one or other, especially by the Tchoglokoffs, who\r\nwere close by. However, I took the note, and slipped it into my right\r\nhand glove; no one had noticed it. On returning to my room, I found, in\r\nfact, a letter from my mother, rolled up in a slip of paper, on which it\r\nwas stated that the Chevalier expected an answer through an Italian\r\nmusician, who attended the Grand Duke's concerts. My mother, rendered\r\nanxious by my involuntary silence, wanted to know the cause of it; she\r\nalso wished to know in what situation I was. I wrote to her, giving her\r\nthe information she required. I told her that I had been forbidden to\r\nwrite to any one, under the pretext that it did not become a Grand\r\nDuchess of Russia to write any letters but such as were composed at the\r\nOffice of Foreign Affairs, where I was only to attach my signature, and\r\nnever to dictate what was to be written, because the ministers knew\r\nbetter than I did what was proper to be said; that it had almost been\r\nmade a crime in M. Olzoufieff that I had sent him a few lines, which I\r\nbegged him to enclose in a letter to my mother. I also gave her\r\ninformation on several other points, about which she had inquired. I\r\nrolled up my note in the same manner as the one I had received, and\r\nwatched with impatience and anxiety the moment for getting rid of it. At\r\nthe first concert given by the Grand Duke, I made the tour of the\r\norchestra, and stopped behind the chair of the solo violinist,\r\nD'Ologlio, who was the person pointed out to me. When he saw me come\r\nbehind his chair, he pretended to take his handkerchief from his\r\ncoat-pocket, and in doing so left his pocket wide open. Without any\r\nappearance of action, I slipped my note into it, and no one had the\r\nslightest suspicion of what had happened. During his stay in St.\r\nPetersburg, Sacromoso delivered to me two or three other notes having\r\nreference to the same matter; my answers were returned in the same\r\nmanner, and no one was ever the wiser.\r\n\r\nFrom the Summer Palace we went to Peterhoff, which was then being\r\nrebuilt. We were lodged in the upper palace, in Peter the First's old\r\nhouse, which was standing at that time. Here, to pass the time, the\r\nGrand Duke took it into his head to play with me every afternoon at\r\ntwo-handed ombre. When I won he got angry, and when I lost he wanted to\r\nbe paid forthwith. I had no money, so he began to play at games of\r\nhazard with me, quite by ourselves. I remember on one occasion his\r\nnight-cap stood with us for 10,000 roubles; but when at the end of the\r\ngame he was a loser, he became furious, and would sometimes sulk for\r\nmany days. This kind of play was not in any way to my taste.\r\n\r\nDuring this stay at Peterhoff we saw from our windows, which looked out\r\nupon the garden towards the sea, that M. and Madame Tchoglokoff were\r\ncontinually passing and repassing from the upper palace towards that of\r\nMonplaisir on the sea-shore, where the Empress was then residing. This\r\nexcited our curiosity, and that of Madame Krause also, to know the\r\nobject of all these journeys. For this purpose Madame Krause went to her\r\nsister's, who was head lady's-maid to the Empress. She returned quite\r\nradiant with pleasure, having learned that all these movements were\r\noccasioned by its having come to the knowledge of the Empress that M.\r\nTchoglokoff had had an intrigue with one of my maids of honour,\r\nMademoiselle Kocheleff, who was with child in consequence. The Empress\r\nhad sent for Madame Tchoglokoff and told her that her husband deceived\r\nher, while she loved him like a fool; that she had been blind to such a\r\ndegree as to have this girl, the favourite of her husband, almost living\r\nwith her; that if she wished to separate from her husband at once it\r\nwould not be displeasing to her Majesty, who even from the beginning had\r\nnot regarded her marriage with M. Tchoglokoff with a favourable eye. Her\r\nMajesty declared to her point-blank that she did not choose him to\r\ncontinue with us, but would dismiss him and leave her in charge. Madame\r\nTchoglokoff at first denied the passion of her husband, and maintained\r\nthat the charge against him was a calumny; but in the meantime her\r\nMajesty had sent some one to question the young lady, who at once\r\nacknowledged the fact. This rendered Madame Tchoglokoff furious against\r\nher husband. She returned home and abused him. He fell upon his knees\r\nand begged her pardon, and made use of all his influence over her to\r\nsoothe her anger. The brood of children which they had also helped to\r\npatch up their difference; but their reconciliation was never sincere.\r\nDisunited in love, they remained connected by interest. The wife\r\npardoned her husband; she went to the Empress, and told her that she had\r\nforgiven everything, and wished to remain with him for the sake of her\r\nchildren. She entreated her Majesty on her knees not to dismiss him\r\nignominiously from court, saying that this would be to disgrace her and\r\ncomplete her misery. In a word, she behaved so well on this occasion,\r\nand with such firmness and generosity, and her grief besides was so\r\nreal, that she disarmed the anger of the Empress. She did more; she led\r\nher husband before her Imperial Majesty, told him many home truths, and\r\nthen threw herself with him at the feet of her Majesty, and entreated\r\nher to pardon him for her sake and that of her six children, whose\r\nfather he was. These different scenes lasted five or six days; and we\r\nlearned, almost hour by hour, what was going on, because we were less\r\nwatched during the time, as every one hoped to see these people\r\ndismissed. But the issue did not answer their expectations; no one was\r\ndismissed but the young lady, who was sent back to her uncle, the Grand\r\nMarshal of the Court, Chepeleff; while the Tchoglokoffs remained, less\r\nglorious, however, than they had been. The day of our departure for\r\nOranienbaum was chosen for the dismissal of Mademoiselle Kocheleff; and\r\nwhile we set off in one direction, she went in another.\r\n\r\nAt Oranienbaum, we resided, this year, in the town, to the right and\r\nleft of the main building, which was small. The affair of Gostilitza had\r\ngiven such a thorough fright, that orders had been issued to examine the\r\nfloors and ceilings in all the houses belonging to the court, and to\r\nrepair those which required attention.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of life I led at Oranienbaum: I rose at three o'clock\r\nin the morning, and dressed myself alone from head to foot in male\r\nattire; an old huntsman whom I had was already waiting for me with the\r\nguns; a fisherman's skiff was ready on the sea-shore: we traversed the\r\ngarden on foot, with our guns upon our shoulders; entered the boat\r\ntogether with a fisherman and a pointer, and I shot ducks in the reeds\r\nwhich bordered on both sides the canal of Oranienbaum, which extends two\r\nverstes into the sea. We often doubled this canal, and consequently were\r\noccasionally, for a considerable time, in the open sea in this skiff.\r\nThe Grand Duke came an hour or two after us; for he must needs always\r\nhave a breakfast and God knows what besides, which he dragged after him.\r\nIf we met we went together, if not each shot and hunted alone. At ten\r\no'clock, and often later, I returned and dressed for dinner. After\r\ndinner we rested; and in the evening the Grand Duke had music, or we\r\nrode out on horseback. Having led this sort of life for about a week, I\r\nfelt myself very much heated and my head confused. I saw that I required\r\nrepose and dieting; so for four-and-twenty hours I ate nothing, drank\r\nonly cold water, and for two nights slept as long as I could. After this\r\nI recommenced the same course of life, and found myself quite well. I\r\nremember reading at that time the Memoirs of Brantôme, which greatly\r\namused me. Before that I had read the Life of Henri IV. by Périfix.\r\n\r\nTowards autumn we returned to town, and learned that we were to go to\r\nMoscow in the course of the winter. Madame Krause came to tell me that\r\nit was necessary to increase my stock of linen for this journey. I\r\nentered into the details of the matter; Madame Krause pretended to amuse\r\nme by having the linen cut up in my room, in order, as she said, to\r\nteach me how many chemises might be cut from a single piece of cloth.\r\nThis instruction or amusement seems to have displeased Madame\r\nTchoglokoff, who had become very ill-tempered since the discovery of her\r\nhusband's infidelity. I know not what she told the Empress; but, at all\r\nevents, she came to me one afternoon and said that her Majesty had\r\ndispensed with Madame Krause's attendance on me, and that she was going\r\nto retire to the residence of her son-in-law the Chamberlain Sievers;\r\nand next day Madame Tchoglokoff brought Madame Vladislava to me to\r\noccupy her place. Madame Vladislava was a tall woman, apparently well\r\nformed, and with an intelligent cast of features, which rather\r\nprepossessed me at the first look. I consulted my oracle Timothy\r\nYevreinoff relative to this choice. He told me that this woman, whom I\r\nhad never before seen, was the mother-in-law of the Counsellor\r\nPougovichnikoff, head clerk to Count Bestoujeff; that she was not\r\nwanting either in intelligence or sprightliness, but was considered very\r\nartful; that I must wait and see how she conducted herself, and\r\nespecially be careful not to place much confidence in her. She was\r\ncalled Praskovia Nikitichna. She began very well; she was sociable, fond\r\nof talking, conversed and narrated with spirit, and had at her fingers'\r\nends, all the anecdotes of the time, past and present. She knew four or\r\nfive generations of all the families, could give at a moment everybody's\r\ngenealogy, father, mother, grandfathers, grandmothers, together with\r\ntheir ancestors, paternal and maternal; and from no one else have I\r\nreceived so much information relative to all that has occurred in Russia\r\nfor the last hundred years. The mind and manners of this woman suited me\r\nvery well; and when I felt dull I made her chat, which she was always\r\nready to do. I easily discovered that she very often disapproved of the\r\nsayings and doings of the Tchoglokoffs; but as she also went very often\r\nto her Majesty's apartments, no one knew why, we were obliged to be on\r\nour guard with her, to a certain degree, not knowing what interpretation\r\nmight be put upon the most innocent words and actions.\r\n\r\nFrom the Summer Palace we passed to the Winter Palace. Here was\r\npresented to us Madame La Tour l'Annois, who had been in attendance on\r\nthe Empress in her early youth, and had accompanied the Princess Anna\r\nPetrovna, eldest daughter of Peter I., when she left Russia with her\r\nhusband, the Duke of Holstein, during the reign of the Emperor Peter II.\r\nAfter the death of this Princess, Madame l'Annois returned to France,\r\nand she now came to Russia, either to remain there, or possibly to\r\nreturn after having obtained some favours from her Majesty. Madame\r\nl'Annois hoped, on the ground of old acquaintance, to re-enter into the\r\nfavour and familiarity of the Empress. But she was greatly deceived;\r\nevery one conspired to exclude her. From the first few days after her\r\narrival I foresaw what would happen, and for this reason: One evening,\r\nwhile they were at cards in the Empress' apartment, her Majesty\r\ncontinued moving from room to room without fixing herself anywhere, as\r\nwas her custom; Madame l'Annois, hoping, no doubt, to pay her court to\r\nher, followed her wherever she went. Madame Tchoglokoff seeing this,\r\nsaid to me, \"See how that woman follows the Empress everywhere; but that\r\nwill not continue long, she will very soon drop that habit of running\r\nafter her.\" I took this as settled, and, in fact, she was first kept at\r\na distance, and finally sent back to France with presents.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter was celebrated the marriage of Count Lestocq with\r\nMademoiselle Mengden, Maid of Honour to the Empress. Her Majesty and the\r\nwhole court assisted at it, and she paid the newly-married couple the\r\nhonour of visiting them at their own house. One would have said that\r\nthey enjoyed the highest favour, but in a couple of months afterwards\r\nfortune turned. One evening, while looking on at those engaged at play\r\nin the apartments of the Empress, I saw the Count, and advanced to speak\r\nto him. \"Do not come near me,\" he said in a low tone, \"I am a suspected\r\nman.\" I thought he must be jesting, and asked what he meant. He replied,\r\n\"I tell you quite seriously not to come near me, because I am a\r\nsuspected man, whom people must shun.\" I saw that he had an altered\r\nlook, and was extremely red. I fancied he must have been drinking, and\r\nturned away. This happened on the Friday. On the Sunday morning, while\r\ndressing my hair, Timothy Yevreinoff said to me, \"Are you aware that\r\nlast night Count Lestocq and his wife were arrested, and conducted to\r\nthe Fortress as state criminals?\" No one knew why, but it became known\r\nthat General Stephen Apraxine and Alexander Schouvaloff had been named\r\ncommissioners for this affair.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the court for Moscow was fixed for the 16th of\r\nDecember. The Czernicheffs had been transported to the Fortress, and\r\nplaced in a house belonging to the Empress, called Smolnoy Dvoretz. The\r\nelder of the three sometimes made his guards drunk, and then went and\r\nwalked into town to his friends. One day, a Finnish wardrobe-maid, who\r\nwas in my service, and was engaged to be married to a servant belonging\r\nto the court, a relation of Yevreinoff, brought me a letter from Andrew\r\nCzernicheff, in which he asked me for several things. This girl had seen\r\nhim at the house of her intended, where they had spent the evening\r\ntogether. I was at a loss where to conceal this letter when I got it,\r\nfor I did not like to burn it, as I wanted to remember what he asked\r\nfor. I had long been forbidden to write even to my mother. I purchased,\r\nthrough this girl, a silver pen and an inkstand. During the day I had\r\nthe letter in my pocket; when I undressed, I slipped it under my garter,\r\ninto my stocking, and before going to bed I removed it, and placed it in\r\nmy sleeve. At last I answered it; sent him what he asked for through the\r\nchannel by which his letter had reached me, and then, at a favourable\r\nmoment, burned this letter which had occasioned me so much anxiety.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of December we set out for Moscow. The Grand Duke and I\r\noccupied a large sledge, and the gentlemen in waiting sat in the front.\r\nDuring the day the Grand Duke joined M. Tchoglokoff in a town sledge,\r\nwhile I remained in the large one. As we never closed this, I conversed\r\nwith those who were seated in front. I remember that the Chamberlain,\r\nPrince Alexander Jourievitch Troubetzkoy, told me, during this time,\r\nthat Count Lestocq, then a prisoner in the Fortress, wanted to starve\r\nhimself during the first eleven days of his detention, but that he had\r\nbeen forced to take nourishment: he had been accused of having accepted\r\n1,000 roubles from the King of Prussia to support his interests, and for\r\nhaving had a person named Oettinger, who might have borne witness\r\nagainst him, poisoned. He was subjected to the torture, and then exiled\r\nto Siberia.\r\n\r\nIn this journey, the Empress passed us at Tver, and as the horses and\r\nprovisions intended for us were taken by her suite, we remained\r\ntwenty-four hours at Tver without horses, and without food. We were\r\ndreadfully hungry. Towards night Tchoglokoff had prepared for us a\r\nroasted sturgeon, which we thought delicious. We set off at night, and\r\nreached Moscow two or three days before Christmas. The first thing we\r\nheard there was, that the Chamberlain of our Court, Prince Alex. Mich.\r\nGalitzine, had received, at the moment of our departure from St.\r\nPetersburg, an order to repair to Hamburg as minister of Russia, with a\r\nsalary of 4,000 roubles. This was looked upon as another case of\r\nbanishment: his sister-in-law, Princess Gagarine, who was with me,\r\ngrieved very much, and we all regretted him.\r\n\r\nWe occupied at Moscow the apartments which I had inhabited with my\r\nmother in 1744. To go to the great church of the court, it was necessary\r\nto make the circuit of the house in a carriage. On Christmas-day, at the\r\nhour for mass, we were on the point of descending to our carriage, and\r\nwere already on the stairs, during a frost of 29 degrees, when a message\r\ncame from the Empress to say that she dispensed with our going to church\r\non this occasion, on account of the extreme cold; it did, in fact,\r\npinch our noses. I was obliged to keep my room during the early portion\r\nof our residence in Moscow, on account of the excessive quantity of\r\npimples which had come on my face: I was dreadfully afraid of having to\r\ncontinue with a pimpled face. I called in the physician Boërhave, who\r\ngave me sedatives, and all sorts of things to dispel these pimples. At\r\nlast, when nothing was of avail, he said to me one day, \"I am going to\r\ngive you something which will drive them away.\" He drew from his pocket\r\na small phial of oil of Falk, and told me to put a drop in a cup of\r\nwater, and to wash my face with it from time to time, say, for instance,\r\nonce a-week. And really the oil of Falk did clear my face, and by the\r\nend of some ten days I was able to appear. A short time after our\r\narrival in Moscow (1749), Madam Vladislava came to tell me that the\r\nEmpress had ordered the marriage of my Finnish wardrobe-maid to take\r\nplace as soon as possible. The only apparent reason for thus hastening\r\nher marriage was, that I had shown some predilection for her; for she\r\nwas a merry creature, who from time to time made me laugh by mimicking\r\nevery one, Madame Tchoglokoff especially being hit off in a very amusing\r\nmanner. She was married, then, and no more said about her.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the Carnival, during which there were no amusements\r\nwhatever, the Empress was seized with a violent cholic, which threatened\r\nto be serious. Madame Vladislava and Timothy Yevreinoff each whispered\r\nthis in my ear, entreating me not to mention to any one who had told me.\r\nWithout naming them, I informed the Grand Duke of it, and he became very\r\nmuch elated. One morning, Yevreinoff came to tell me that the Chancellor\r\nBestoujeff and General Apraxine had passed the previous night in the\r\napartment of M. and Madame Tchoglokoff, which seemed to imply that the\r\nEmpress was very ill. Tchoglokoff and his wife were more gruff than\r\never; they came into our apartments, dined there, supped, but never\r\nallowed a word to escape them relative to this illness. We did not speak\r\nof it either, and consequently did not dare to send and inquire how her\r\nMajesty was, because we should have been immediately asked, \"How,\r\nwhence, by whom came you to learn, that she was ill?\" and any one named,\r\nor even suspected, would infallibly have been dismissed, exiled, or even\r\nsent to the Secret Chancery, that state inquisition, more dreaded than\r\ndeath itself. At last her Majesty, at the end of ten days, became\r\nbetter, and the wedding of one of her maids of honour took place at\r\ncourt. At table I was seated by the side of the Countess Schouvaloff,\r\nthe favourite of the Empress. She told me that her Majesty was still so\r\nweak from the severe illness she had just had, that she had placed her\r\ndiamonds on the bride's head (an honour which she paid to all her maids\r\nof honour) while seated in bed, her feet only being outside; and that it\r\nwas for this reason she was not present at the wedding-feast. As the\r\nCountess Schouvaloff was the first to speak to me of this illness, I\r\nexpressed to her the pain which her Majesty's condition gave me, and the\r\ninterest I took in it. She said her Majesty would be pleased to learn\r\nhow much I felt for her. Two mornings after this, Madame Tchoglokoff\r\ncame to my room, and, in the presence of Madame Vladislava, told me that\r\nthe Empress was very angry with the Grand Duke and myself on account of\r\nthe little interest we had taken in her illness, even carrying our\r\nindifference to such an extent as not once to send and inquire how she\r\nwas. I told Madame Tchoglokoff that I appealed to herself, that neither\r\nshe nor her husband had spoken a single word to us about the illness of\r\nher Majesty, and that knowing nothing of it, we had not been able to\r\ntestify our interest in it. She replied, \"How can you say that you knew\r\nnothing of it, when the Countess Schouvaloff has informed her Majesty\r\nthat you spoke to her at table about it.\" I replied, \"It is true that I\r\ndid so, because she told me her Majesty was still weak and could not\r\nleave her room, and then I asked her the particulars of this illness.\"\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff went away grumbling, and Madame Vladislava said it\r\nwas very strange to try and pick a quarrel with people about a matter of\r\nwhich they were ignorant; that since the Tchoglokoffs alone had the\r\nright to speak of it, and did not speak, the fault was theirs, not ours,\r\nif we failed through ignorance. Some time afterwards, on a court-day,\r\nthe Empress approached me, and I found a favourable moment for telling\r\nher that neither Tchoglokoff nor his wife had given us any intimation of\r\nher illness, and that therefore it had not been in our power to express\r\nto her the interest we had taken in it. She received this very well, and\r\nit seemed to me that the credit of these people was diminishing.\r\n\r\nThe first week of Lent, M. Tchoglokoff wished to go to his duty. He\r\nconfessed, but the confessor of the Empress forbade him to communicate.\r\nThe whole court said it was by the order of her Majesty, on account of\r\nhis adventure with Mademoiselle Kocheleff. During a portion of our stay\r\nat Moscow, M. Tchoglokoff appeared to be intimately connected with Count\r\nBestoujeff and his tool General Stephen Apraxine. He was continually\r\nwith them, and, to hear him speak, one would have supposed him to be the\r\nintimate adviser of Count Bestoujeff--a thing that was quite impossible,\r\nfor Bestoujeff had far too much sense to allow himself to be guided by\r\nsuch an arrogant fool as Tchoglokoff. But, at about half the period of\r\nour stay, this intimacy suddenly ceased--I do not exactly know why--and\r\nTchoglokoff became the sworn enemy of those with whom he had been so\r\nintimate a short time previously.\r\n\r\nShortly after my arrival in Moscow, I began, for want of other\r\namusement, to read the History of Germany, by le Père Barre, canon of\r\nSte. Geneviève, in nine volumes quarto. Every week I finished one, after\r\nwhich I read the works of Plato. My rooms faced the street; the\r\ncorresponding ones were occupied by the Duke, whose windows opened upon\r\na small yard. When reading in my room, one of my maids usually came in,\r\nand remained there standing as long as she wished; she then retired, and\r\nanother took her place when she thought it suitable. I made Madame\r\nVladislava see that this routine could serve no useful purpose, but was\r\nmerely an inconvenience; that, besides, I already had much to suffer\r\nfrom the proximity of my apartments to those of the Grand Duke, by which\r\nshe, too, was equally discommoded, as she occupied a small cabinet at\r\nthe end of my rooms. She consented, therefore, to relieve my maids from\r\nthis species of etiquette. This is the kind of annoyance we had to put\r\nup with, morning, noon and night, even to a late hour: The Grand Duke,\r\nwith rare perseverance, trained a pack of dogs, and with heavy blows of\r\nhis whip, and cries like those of the huntsmen, made them fly from one\r\nend to the other of his two rooms, which were all he had. Such of the\r\ndogs as became tired, or got out of rank, were severely punished, which\r\nmade them howl still more. When he got tired of this detestable\r\nexercise, so painful to the ears and destructive to the repose of his\r\nneighbours, he seized his violin, on which he rasped away with\r\nextraordinary violence, and very badly, all the time walking up and\r\ndown his rooms. Then he recommenced the education and punishment of his\r\ndogs, which to me seemed very cruel. On one occasion, hearing one of\r\nthese animals howl piteously and for a long time, I opened the door of\r\nmy bed-room, where I was seated, and which adjoined the apartment in\r\nwhich this scene was enacted, and saw him holding this dog by the\r\ncollar, suspended in the air, while a boy who was in his service, a\r\nKalmuck by birth, held the animal by the tail. It was a poor little King\r\nCharles's dog of English breed, and the Duke was beating him with all\r\nhis might with the heavy handle of a whip. I interceded for the poor\r\nbeast, but this only made him redouble his blows. Unable to bear so\r\ncruel a scene, I returned to my room with tears in my eyes. In general,\r\ntears and cries, instead of moving the Duke to pity, put him in a\r\npassion. Pity was a feeling that was painful, and even insupportable in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, my valet Timothy Yevreinoff transmitted to me a letter\r\nfrom his old comrade Andrew Czernicheff, who had at last been set at\r\nliberty, and was passing near Moscow, to join the regiment in which he\r\nhad been placed as lieutenant. I managed with this letter as with the\r\nformer one, sent him all he asked for, and never mentioned a word about\r\nthe matter either to the Grand Duke or any one else.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, the Empress took us to Perova, where we spent some days\r\nwith her at the residence of Count Razoumowsky. The Grand Duke and M.\r\nTchoglokoff scoured the woods almost daily, accompanied by the master of\r\nthe house. I read in my room, or else Madame Tchoglokoff, when she was\r\nnot at cards, came and kept me company to dissipate her ennui. She\r\ncomplained bitterly of the amusements of this place, and especially of\r\nthe constant indulgence of her husband in the sports of the chase, for\r\nhe had become a passionate sportsman since he had received at Moscow the\r\npresent of a beautiful English greyhound. I learned from others that he\r\nwas the laughing-stock of all the sportsmen, and that he fancied, and\r\nwas made to believe that his Circe (the name of his dog) caught all the\r\nhares that were taken. In general, M. Tchoglokoff was very apt to\r\nbelieve that everything belonging to him was of rare beauty and\r\nexcellence; his wife, his children, his servants, his house, his table,\r\nhis horses, his dogs--everything that was his, although in reality very\r\nmediocre, participated in his self love, and, as belonging to him,\r\nbecame in his eyes of incomparable value.\r\n\r\nOne day, while at Perova, I was seized with a headache so violent that I\r\ndo not remember ever having had anything like it in my life. The\r\nexcessive pain brought on violent sickness. I threw up repeatedly, and\r\nevery movement in my room made me worse. I remained in this state for\r\nnearly four-and-twenty hours, and then fell asleep. The next day I felt\r\nnothing but weakness. Madame Tchoglokoff took all possible care of me\r\nduring this severe attack. Generally speaking, all the persons who had\r\nbeen placed about me by an ill-will the most unequivocal, began in a\r\nshort time to take an involuntary interest in me; and, when they were\r\nnot interfered with or stimulated anew, they used to act against the\r\nprinciples of their employers, and yield to the impulse which attracted\r\nthem towards me, or rather to the interest with which I inspired them.\r\nThey never found me sulky or peevish, but always ready to meet the\r\nslightest advance on their part. In all this my natural gaiety was of\r\ngreat service to me, for all these Arguses were often amused with my\r\nconversation, and relaxed in spite of themselves.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty had a new attack of cholic at Perova. She was carried to\r\nMoscow, and we went slowly to the palace, which is only four verstes\r\nfrom there. This attack had no ill consequence, and shortly afterwards\r\nshe made a pilgrimage to the convent of Troïtza. She wished to make\r\nthese sixty verstes on foot, and for this purpose went to Pokrovskoe\r\nHouse. We were ordered to take the Troïtza road, and we took up our\r\nquarters on this road about eleven verstes from Moscow, at a very small\r\ncountry-house called Rajova, belonging to Madame Tchoglokoff. The only\r\naccommodations were a small saloon in the centre of the house, and two\r\nvery small rooms on each side of it. Tents were placed round the house\r\nfor the use of our suite. The Grand Duke had one; I occupied one of the\r\nlittle rooms, Madame Vladislava another, the Tchoglokoffs the remainder.\r\nWe dined in the saloon. The Empress walked three or four verstes, then\r\nrested some days. This journey lasted nearly the whole summer. We hunted\r\nevery day after dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen her Majesty reached Taïninskoe, which is nearly opposite Rajova, on\r\nthe other side of the high road leading to the convent of Troïtza, the\r\nHetman, Count Razoumowsky, younger brother of the favourite--who was\r\nresiding at his country seat of Pokrovskoe, on the road to St.\r\nPetersburg, on the other side of Moscow--took it into his head to come\r\nand see us every day at Rajova. He was very gay, and nearly of our own\r\nage. We liked him very much. As brother of the favourite, M. and Madame\r\nTchoglokoff willingly received him into their house. His assiduity\r\ncontinued all the summer, and we were always pleased to see him. He\r\ndined and supped with us, and after supper returned again to his estate;\r\nhe consequently travelled forty or fifty verstes a-day. Some twenty\r\nyears later, it occurred to me to ask him what it was that could then\r\ninduce him to come and share the dulness and insipidity of our life at\r\nRajova, while his own house was daily crowded with the best company at\r\nMoscow. He replied, unhesitatingly, \"Love.\" \"But what on earth could you\r\nhave found to love at our house?\" \"What!\" he said, \"why, you.\" I burst\r\ninto a loud laugh, for the idea had never once crossed my mind; besides\r\nhe had been married for some years to a rich heiress of the house of\r\nNarichkine, whom the Empress had made him marry, a little against his\r\nwill it is true, but with whom he seemed to live on good terms. Added to\r\nthis, it was well known that the handsomest women of the court and city\r\ncontended for his notice; and, indeed, he was a fine man, of an original\r\nturn, very agreeable, and with far more intelligence than his brother,\r\nwho however equalled him in beauty, while surpassing him in generosity\r\nand kindness. These two brothers were the most generally liked\r\nfavourites I have ever known.\r\n\r\nAbout the Feast of St. Peter, the Empress sent us word to join her at\r\nBratovchina. We repaired thither immediately. As during the spring and a\r\npart of the summer I had either been engaged in sporting, or otherwise\r\nconstantly in the open air, Rajova House being so small that we spent\r\nthe greater part of the day in the neighbouring woods, I arrived at\r\nBratovchina with my face very red and tanned. When the Empress saw me,\r\nshe exclaimed against this redness, and said she would send me a wash to\r\nremove it, and she did so; she immediately sent a phial containing a\r\nliquid composed of lemon-juice, white of egg, and French brandy, and\r\nordered that my maids should learn its composition, and the proper\r\nproportions of its ingredients. At the end of a few days my sun-burns\r\nhad disappeared, and I have since used this composition, and recommended\r\nit to others for similar purposes. When the skin is heated, I do not\r\nknow of a better remedy. It is also good for what they call in Russia\r\nTetters, and which is nothing but a heating of the skin, which causes it\r\nto crack. I cannot at the moment recall the French term for this\r\ncomplaint.[9]\r\n\r\nWe spent the Feast of St. Peter at the convent of Troïtza, and as the\r\nGrand Duke could find nothing to do after dinner, he took it into his\r\nhead to have a ball in his own room, where, however, his only company\r\nwere his two valets and my two maids, one of whom was over fifty. From\r\nthe convent her Majesty went to Taïninskoe, while we returned to Rajova,\r\nand resumed our former mode of life. We remained there till the middle\r\nof August, when the Empress made a journey to Sophino, a place situated\r\nat sixty or seventy verstes from Moscow. Here we encamped. On the\r\nmorning after our arrival we went to her Majesty's tent, and found her\r\nscolding the person who had the management of this estate. She had come\r\nhere to hunt, and found no hares. The man was pale and trembling, and\r\nthere was nothing that she did not say to him; she was really furious.\r\nSeeing that we had come to kiss her hand, she embraced us as usual, and\r\nthen went on with her scolding, bringing within the sphere of her\r\nremarks every one she felt disposed to find fault with. This was done\r\ngradually, and while speaking with extreme volubility. She said, among\r\nother things, that she perfectly understood the management of land; that\r\nthe reign of the Empress Anne had taught her this; that having but\r\nlittle, she took care to avoid extravagance; that had she gone in debt,\r\nshe would have been afraid of being damned: for if she had died in such\r\na condition no one would have paid her debts, and then her soul would\r\nhave gone to hell, and that she had no fancy for; that therefore, when\r\nshe was in the house, or not otherwise obliged to make an appearance,\r\nshe dressed very simply, her outside dress being of white taffeta and\r\nthe under of dark gray, and in this manner she economized, taking good\r\ncare not to wear expensive clothes in the country or when travelling.\r\nThis, of course, had reference to me, for I wore a dress of silvered\r\nlilac. I took the hint. This dissertation--for such it was, no one\r\nventuring to speak, seeing her flushed with passion--lasted more than\r\nthree-quarters of an hour. At last, a fool she had, named Aksakoff, put\r\na stop to it. He came in carrying a little porcupine, which he presented\r\nto her, in his hat. She advanced to look at it, but the instant she saw\r\nit she uttered a piercing cry, saying that it looked like a mouse, and\r\nran precipitately into the interior of the tent, for she had a mortal\r\nantipathy to mice. We saw no more of her: she dined alone. After dinner\r\nshe went to the chase, took the Grand Duke with her, and ordered me to\r\nreturn with Madame Tchoglokoff to Moscow, where the Grand Duke arrived\r\nsome hours afterwards, the chase having been but brief, in consequence\r\nof the high wind that prevailed that day.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday the Empress sent for us to join her at Taïninskoe--we were\r\nthen at Rajova, whither we had returned--and we had the honour of dining\r\nwith her Majesty. She sat alone at the head of the table, the Grand Duke\r\nat her right, I at her left, opposite to him. Near the Grand Duke was\r\nMarshal Boutourline, near me the Countess Schouvaloff. The table was\r\nvery long and narrow. Thus seated between the Empress and the Marshal,\r\nthe Grand Duke, not a little aided by the Marshal, who was by no means\r\nan enemy to wine himself, managed to get exceedingly intoxicated. He\r\nneither knew what he said or did, stuttered in his speech, and made\r\nhimself so very disagreeable, that tears came into my eyes; for at that\r\ntime I concealed and palliated as much as possible all that was\r\nreprehensible in him. The Empress was pleased with my sensibility, and\r\nleft the table earlier than usual. His Imperial Highness was to have\r\ngone hunting in the afternoon with Count Razoumowsky, but he remained at\r\nTaïninskoe, while I returned to Rajova. On the way I was seized with a\r\nviolent toothache. The weather began to be cold and wet, and we were but\r\nbadly sheltered at Rajova. The brother of Madame Tchoglokoff, Count\r\nHendrikoff, who was the chamberlain on duty with me, proposed to his\r\nsister to cure me instantly. She spoke to me on the subject, and I\r\nconsented to try his remedy, which seemed to be nothing at all, or\r\nrather a mere charlatanism. He went immediately into the other room, and\r\nbrought out a very small roll of paper, which he desired me to chew with\r\nthe aching tooth. Hardly had I done so when the pain became so extremely\r\nviolent that I was obliged to go to bed. I got into such a burning\r\nfever, that I began to be delirious. Madame Tchoglokoff, terrified at my\r\ncondition, and attributing it to her brother's remedy, got very angry\r\nand abused him. She remained at my bedside all the night, sent word to\r\nthe Empress that her house at Rajova was in no way fit for a person so\r\nseriously ill as I appeared to be, and in fact made such a stir, that\r\nthe next day I was removed to Moscow very ill. I was ten or twelve days\r\nin bed, and the toothache returned every afternoon at the same hour.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September, the Empress went to the convent of\r\nVoskressensky, whither we were ordered to go for the feast of her name.\r\nOn that day M. Ivan Ivanovitch Schouvaloff was declared a Gentleman of\r\nthe Bedchamber. This was an event at court. Every one whispered that a\r\nnew favourite had appeared. I was rejoiced at his promotion, for, while\r\nhe was a page, I had marked him out as a person of promise, on account\r\nof his studiousness; he was always to be seen with a book in his hand.\r\n\r\nHaving returned from this excursion, I was seized with a sore throat\r\naccompanied with much fever. The Empress came to see me during this\r\nillness. When barely convalescent, and while still very weak, her\r\nMajesty ordered me, through Madame Tchoglokoff, to assist at the wedding\r\nand dress the hair of the niece of the Countess Roumianzoff, who was\r\nabout to be married to M. Alexander Narichkine, subsequently created\r\nchief cupbearer. Madame Tchoglokoff, who saw that I was scarcely\r\nconvalescent, was a little pained in announcing to me this compliment, a\r\ncompliment which gave me but little pleasure, as it plainly showed how\r\nlittle was cared for my health, perhaps even for my life. I spoke in\r\nthis view to Madame Vladislava, who seemed, like myself, but little\r\npleased with this order, an order evidently given without care or\r\nconsideration. I exerted myself, however, and on the day fixed the bride\r\nwas led to my room. I adorned her head with my diamonds, and she was\r\nthen conducted to the court church to be married. As for me, I had to go\r\nto Narichkine House, accompanied by Madame Tchoglokoff and my own court.\r\nNow, we were living at Moscow, in the palace at the end of the German\r\nSloboda. To reach the residence of the Narichkines it was necessary to\r\ngo right through Moscow, and travel at least seven verstes. It was in\r\nthe month of October, about nine o'clock at night. It froze excessively\r\nhard, and the ground was so slippery that we had to travel very slowly.\r\nWe were at least two hours and a-half in going, and the same in\r\nreturning, and there was not a man or horse in my suite that had not one\r\nor more falls. At last having reached the church of Kasansky, which was\r\nnear the gate called Troïtzkaja, we met with another impediment, for in\r\nthis church was married, at the very same hour, the sister of Ivan\r\nIvanovitch Schouvaloff. Her hair had been dressed by the Empress\r\nherself, while I dressed that of Mademoiselle Roumianzoff. A great\r\ncrowding of carriages occurred at this gate. We had to stop at every\r\nstep; then the falls recommenced; not one of the horses had been rough\r\nshod. At last we reached the house, and not in the best humour in the\r\nworld. We waited a long time for the bride and bridegroom, who had met\r\nwith the same impediments as ourselves. The Grand Duke accompanied the\r\nbride. Then we waited for the Empress. At last we sat down to supper.\r\nAfter supper, there were a few rounds of dancing in the ante-chamber as\r\na matter of ceremony, and then we were told to lead the bride and\r\nbridegroom to their apartments. For this purpose we had to pass along\r\nseveral cold corridors, mount staircases equally cold, and then traverse\r\nlong galleries hastily constructed of damp boards, from which the water\r\noozed in all directions. At last, having reached the apartments, we sat\r\ndown to a table spread with a dessert, remaining only long enough to\r\ndrink the health of the newly married. Then the bride was led to her\r\nchamber, and we returned home. The next evening we had to repeat our\r\nvisit. Would any one have believed it? This turmoil, instead of injuring\r\nmy health, did not in the least retard my convalescence. The following\r\nday I was better than the previous one.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of winter, I saw that the Grand Duke was very much\r\ndisturbed. I did not know what was the matter. He no longer trained his\r\ndogs. He came into my room twenty times a-day, looked anxious,\r\nthoughtful, and absent. He bought German books, and such books! One\r\nportion consisted of Lutheran prayer-books, the other of the history and\r\ntrial of some highway robbers who had been hung or broken on the wheel.\r\nThese he read by turns when not playing the violin. As he could not long\r\nkeep on his mind anything which tormented him, and as he had no one to\r\nspeak to but me, I waited patiently for his revelation.\r\n\r\nAt last he told me what it was that disturbed him, and I found the\r\nmatter far more serious than I had anticipated. During the whole summer\r\npretty nearly, at all events during our stay at Rajova, on the road to\r\nthe convent of Troïtza, I scarcely ever saw him, except at table or in\r\nbed. He came to bed after I was asleep, and rose before I was awake. The\r\nrest of his time was passed in hunting or in preparations for it.\r\nTchoglokoff had obtained, under pretext of amusing the Grand Duke, two\r\npacks of dogs from the Master of the Hounds, the one of Russian dogs and\r\nhuntsmen, the other of French or German dogs. To the latter were\r\nattached an old French whipper-in, a lad from Courland, and a German. As\r\nM. Tchoglokoff took the direction of the Russian pack, the Grand Duke\r\nundertook that of the foreign one, about which Tchoglokoff did not in\r\nthe least trouble himself. Each entered into the minutest details of his\r\nown charge, and the Grand Duke therefore was constantly going to the\r\nkennel of his pack, or the huntsmen were coming to him to inform him of\r\nits condition, and of the wants and deeds of the dogs. In a word, if I\r\nmust speak plainly, he made himself the companion of these men, drinking\r\nwith them in the chase, and being constantly among them. The regiment\r\nof Boutirsky was then at Moscow. In this regiment was a lieutenant named\r\nYakoff Batourine, a man overwhelmed with debt, a gambler, and well known\r\nto be a worthless fellow, but a very determined one. I know not how this\r\nman happened to get acquainted with the Grand Duke's huntsmen, but I\r\nbelieve both had their quarters in or near the village of Moutistcha or\r\nAlexeewsky. At last matters went on so far, that the huntsmen told the\r\nDuke there was a lieutenant in the regiment of Boutirsky who manifested\r\na great attachment to his Imperial Highness, and who said, besides, that\r\nthe entire regiment entertained the same feelings as himself. The Grand\r\nDuke listened to this recital with complacency, and made inquiries of\r\nthe huntsmen relative to this regiment. They spoke very disparagingly of\r\nthe superior officers, and very highly of the subalterns. At last\r\nBatourine, still through the huntsmen, asked to be presented to the\r\nGrand Duke, at the chase. To this the Duke was not altogether favourable\r\nat first, but at last he consented. By little and little it was so\r\nmanaged that the Duke, while hunting one day, met Batourine in a retired\r\nspot. Batourine on seeing him, fell on his knees, and swore to\r\nacknowledge no other master but him, and to do whatever he commanded.\r\nThe Grand Duke told me that on hearing this oath he became very much\r\nalarmed, gave both spurs to his horse, and left Batourine on his knees\r\nin the wood. The huntsmen, he said, were in advance, and did not hear\r\nwhat had been said. He pretended that this was all the connection he had\r\nhad with the man, and that he had even advised the huntsmen to take care\r\nthat he did not get them into mischief. His present anxiety was\r\noccasioned by his learning from the huntsmen that Batourine had been\r\narrested and transferred to Preobrajenskoe, where the Secret Chancery,\r\nwhich took cognizance of crimes against the state, was established. His\r\nImperial Highness trembled for the huntsmen, and was very much afraid of\r\nbeing himself compromised. As far as the former were concerned, his\r\nfears were realized; for, a few days afterwards, they were arrested and\r\nconducted to Preobrajenskoe. I endeavoured to diminish his distress by\r\nrepresenting to him, that if he really had not entered into any parley\r\nbeyond what he had mentioned, it appeared to me that, at the worst, he\r\nhad only been guilty of an imprudence, in mixing himself up with such\r\nbad company. I cannot say whether he told me the truth. I have reason to\r\nbelieve that he attenuated what there might be of parleying in the\r\naffair, for even to me he spoke about the matter in broken sentences,\r\nand as if unwillingly. However, the excessive fear he was in might also\r\nhave produced this same effect upon him. A short time afterwards he came\r\nto tell me that some huntsmen had been set at liberty, but with an order\r\nto be conveyed beyond the frontier, and that they had sent him word that\r\nthey had not mentioned his name. This information delighted him beyond\r\nmeasure; his mind became at ease, and no more was heard of the matter.\r\nAs for Batourine, he was found very culpable. I have not since read or\r\nseen the account of his examination, but I have learned that he\r\nmeditated nothing less than to kill the Empress, to set fire to the\r\npalace, and in the horror and confusion to place the Grand Duke on the\r\nthrone. He was condemned, after being subjected to the torture, to pass\r\nthe remainder of his days shut up in the fortress of Schlusselburg.\r\nHaving, during my reign, endeavoured to make his escape from this\r\nprison, he was sent to Kamtchatka, whence he fled with Benjousky, and\r\nwas killed while pillaging _en passant_ the island of Formosa, in the\r\nPacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of December we left Moscow for St. Petersburg, travelling\r\nnight and day in an open sledge. About midway I was again seized with a\r\nviolent toothache. Notwithstanding this, the Grand Duke would not\r\nconsent to close the sledge: scarcely would he allow me to draw the\r\ncurtain a little, so as to shelter me from a cold and damp wind, blowing\r\nright into my face. At last we reached Zarskoe-Selo, where the Empress\r\nhad already arrived, having passed us on the road, according to her\r\nusual custom. As soon as I stepped out of the sledge I entered the\r\napartment destined for us, and sent for her Majesty's physician\r\nBoërhave, the nephew of the celebrated Boërhave, requesting him to have\r\nthe tooth which had tormented me so much for the last four or five\r\nmonths extracted. He consented with great reluctance, and only because I\r\nabsolutely insisted on it. At last he sent for Gyon, my surgeon: I sat\r\non the ground, Boërhave on one side, Tchoglokoff on the other, and Gyon\r\ndrew the tooth; but the moment he did so, my eyes, nose, and mouth\r\nbecame fountains, whence poured out--from my mouth, blood, from my eyes\r\nand nose water. Boërhave, who was a man of clear and sound judgment,\r\ninstantly exclaimed, \"Clumsy!\" and calling for the tooth, he added, \"I\r\nfeared it would be so, and that was why I did not wish it to be drawn.\"\r\nGyon, in extracting the tooth, had carried away with it a portion of the\r\nlower jaw, to which it was attached. At this moment the Empress came to\r\nthe door of my room, and I was afterwards told that she was moved even\r\nto tears. I was put to bed, and suffered a great deal during four weeks,\r\neven in the city, whither we went next day, notwithstanding all this,\r\nand still in open sleighs. I did not leave my room till the middle of\r\nJanuary, 1750, for the lower part of my cheek still bore in blue and\r\nyellow stains, the impression of the five fingers of M. Gyon. On\r\nnew-year's day this year wishing to have my hair dressed, I noticed that\r\nthe young man who was to do it, a Kalmuck whom I had trained for this\r\npurpose, was excessively red, and his eyes very piercing. I asked what\r\nwas the matter, and learned that he had a very bad headache and great\r\nheat. I sent him away, desiring him to go to bed, for indeed he was not\r\nfit to do anything. He retired, and in the evening I was informed that\r\nthe small-pox had broken out upon him. I escaped with nothing worse than\r\nthe fright which this gave me, for I did not catch the disease, although\r\nhe had combed my hair.\r\n\r\nThe Empress remained at Zarskoe-Selo during a considerable portion of\r\nthe Carnival. Petersburg was nearly deserted, for most of its residents\r\nlived there from necessity rather than choice. While the court was at\r\nMoscow, and also when on its return to St. Petersburg, all the courtiers\r\nwere eager to obtain leave of absence for a year, six months, or even a\r\nfew weeks. The officials, such as senators, and others, did the same;\r\nand when they were afraid of not succeeding, then came the illnesses,\r\nreal or feigned, of husbands, wives, fathers, brothers, mothers,\r\nsisters, or children; or lawsuits, or other business which it was\r\nindispensable to settle. In a word, it sometimes took six months, or\r\neven more, before the court and the city became what they were\r\npreviously to one of these absences; and when the court was away, the\r\ngrass grew in the streets of St. Petersburg, for there were scarcely any\r\ncarriages in the city. In such a state of things, at the present moment,\r\nthere was not much company to be expected, especially by us who were so\r\nmuch shut up. M. Tchoglokoff thought to amuse us during this time, or\r\nrather to amuse himself and his wife, by inviting us to play at cards\r\nwith him in the apartments which he occupied at court, and which\r\nconsisted of four or five rather small rooms. He also invited there the\r\nladies and gentlemen in waiting, and the Princess of Courland, daughter\r\nof Duke Ernest John Biren, the ancient favourite of the Empress Anne.\r\nThe Empress Elizabeth had recalled this Duke from Siberia, whither he\r\nhad been exiled under the regency of the Princess Anne. There, the Duke\r\nwas living with his wife, his sons, and his daughter. This daughter was\r\nneither handsome nor pretty, nor well made, for she was humpbacked, and\r\nrather small; but she had fine eyes, much intelligence, and a singular\r\ntalent for intrigue. Her parents were not very fond of her; she\r\npretended, indeed, that they constantly ill-treated her. One day she\r\nfled from home, and took refuge with the wife of the Waiwode of\r\nYaroslav, Madame Pouchkine. This woman, delighted to have an opportunity\r\nof giving herself importance at court, took her to Moscow, addressed\r\nherself to Madame Schouvaloff, and the flight of the Princess of\r\nCourland from her father's house was represented as the result of the\r\nill-treatment she had received from her parents, in consequence of her\r\nhaving expressed a desire to embrace the religion of the Greek church.\r\nIn fact, the first thing she did at court was to make her profession of\r\nfaith. The Empress stood godmother for her, after which she received an\r\nappointment among the maids of honour. M. Tchoglokoff made it a point to\r\nshow her attention, because her elder brother had laid the foundation of\r\nhis fortune, by taking him from the corps of cadets, where he was\r\nreceiving his education, removing him into the horse-guards, and keeping\r\nhim about himself as a messenger. The Princess of Courland thus brought\r\ninto our society, and playing daily for hours at trisset with the Grand\r\nDuke, Tchoglokoff, and myself, conducted herself at first with great\r\ndiscretion. She was insinuating, and her intelligence made one forget\r\nwhat was disagreeable in her figure, especially when seated. She adapted\r\nher conversation to the character of her auditors, speaking to each in\r\nthe manner most likely to be agreeable. Every one looked upon her as an\r\ninteresting orphan, and a person not likely to be in any one's way. In\r\nthe eyes of the Grand Duke she had another merit, and no slight one\r\neither--she was a sort of foreign Princess, and, what was more, a\r\nGerman; he therefore always spoke to her in German, and this gave her a\r\ncharm in his eyes. He began to pay her as much attention as he was\r\ncapable of doing. When she dined alone, he sent her wine, as well as\r\nfavourite dishes from his table, and when he got hold of some new\r\ngrenadier's cap or shoulder-belt, he sent them to her to look at. The\r\nPrincess of Courland, who at that time might be about four or five and\r\ntwenty, was not the only acquisition made by the court at Moscow. The\r\nEmpress had then taken the two Countesses Voronzoff, nieces of the\r\nVice-Chancellor, and daughters of Count Roman Voronzoff, his younger\r\nbrother. Mary, the elder, might be about fourteen; she was placed among\r\nthe Empress' maids of honour. The younger sister, Elizabeth, was only\r\neleven; she was given to me. She was a very ugly child, of an olive\r\ncomplexion, and excessively slovenly. Towards the end of the Carnival,\r\nher Majesty returned to town, and in the first week of Lent we began to\r\nprepare for our duty. On the Wednesday evening I was to take a bath at\r\nthe house of Madame Tchoglokoff, but on Tuesday evening she came to my\r\nroom, and told the Grand Duke, who was with me, that it was her\r\nMajesty's pleasure that he also should take a bath. Now the baths, and\r\nall other Russian customs and habits, were not simply disagreeable to\r\nthe Duke, he had a mortal hatred for them. He therefore unceremoniously\r\ndeclared that he would do nothing of the kind. She, who was equally\r\nobstinate, and had no kind of reserve or ceremony in her speech, told\r\nhim that this was an act of disobedience to her Imperial Majesty. He\r\nmaintained that he ought not to be required to do what was repugnant to\r\nhis nature; that he knew that the bath, in which he had never been, was\r\nunsuitable to his constitution; that he did not want to die; that life\r\nwas the thing he held most dear, and that her Majesty should never\r\ncompel him to go into the bath. Madame Tchoglokoff replied that her\r\nMajesty would know how to punish his disobedience. At this he became\r\nangry, and exclaimed, passionately, \"I should like to see what she can\r\ndo; I am not a child.\" Madame Tchoglokoff threatened that the Empress\r\nwould send him to the Fortress. At this he cried bitterly; and they went\r\non answering each other in the most outrageous terms that passion could\r\ndictate; in fact, they both acted as if they had not between them a\r\ngrain of common sense. At last, Madame Tchoglokoff departed, saying that\r\nshe would report the conversation to her Imperial Majesty word for word.\r\nI know not what she did in the matter, but she returned presently with\r\nan entirely different theme, for she came to inform us that her Imperial\r\nMajesty was very angry that we had no children, and wished to know which\r\nof us was in fault; that she would therefore send a midwife to me, and a\r\nphysician to the Grand Duke. To this she added various other outrageous\r\nremarks--remarks which had neither head nor tail, and concluded by\r\nsaying that her Majesty had dispensed with our going to our duty this\r\nweek, because the Grand Duke said the bath was injurious to his health.\r\nI must state that during these two conversations I never once opened my\r\nlips; in the first place, because they both spoke with such vehemence\r\nthat I could find no chance of putting in a word; secondly, because I\r\nsaw that both of them were utterly unreasonable. I do not know what view\r\nthe Empress took of the matter, but, at all events, nothing more was\r\nsaid on either topic.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-Lent, her Majesty went to Gostilitza, to the residence of\r\nCount Razoumowsky, to celebrate his feast, and we were sent, together\r\nwith her maids of honour and our ordinary suite, to Zarskoe-Selo. The\r\nweather was wonderfully mild, even warm, so that, on the 17th of March,\r\ninstead of there being snow on the road, there was dust. Having\r\nestablished ourselves at Zarskoe-Selo, the Grand Duke and Tchoglokoff\r\nrecommenced their hunting; I and the ladies walked or drove out as long\r\nas we could, and in the evening we all played at various small games.\r\nHere the Grand Duke manifested a decided partiality for the Princess of\r\nCourland, especially when he had been drinking in the evening--a thing\r\nwhich happened every day. He was always at her side, and spoke to no one\r\nbut her. At last this thing went on in the most glaring manner, before\r\nmy eyes, and before every one, so that my vanity and self-love began to\r\nbe shocked at finding myself slighted for the sake of a little, deformed\r\ncreature like this. One evening, on rising from table, Madame Vladislava\r\nsaid to me that every one was disgusted to see this little hunchback\r\npreferred to me. \"It cannot be helped,\" I said, as the tears started to\r\nmy eyes. I went to bed; scarcely was I asleep when the Grand Duke also\r\ncame to bed. As he was tipsy, and knew not what he was doing, he spoke\r\nto me for the purpose of expatiating on the eminent qualities of his\r\nfavourite. To check his garrulity as soon as possible, I pretended to be\r\nfast asleep. He spoke still louder in order to wake me, but finding that\r\nI still slept, he gave me two or three rather hard blows in the side\r\nwith his fist; then, growling at the heaviness of my slumbers, he turned\r\non his side and dropped asleep himself. I wept long and bitterly that\r\nnight, as well on account of the matter itself, and the blows he had\r\ngiven me, as on that of my general situation, which was in all respects\r\nas disagreeable as it was wearisome. In the morning, the Duke seemed\r\nashamed of what he had done; he did not speak of it, and I acted as if I\r\nhad not felt anything. Two days afterwards we returned to town. The last\r\nweek of Lent we recommenced our preparations for going to our duty.\r\nNothing more was said to the Duke about the bath.\r\n\r\nAnother occurrence took place this week which perplexed him a little.\r\nWhile in his room he was nearly always in constant movement of one sort\r\nor other. One afternoon he was exercising himself in cracking an immense\r\ncoachman's whip, which he had had made for him. He whipped about right\r\nand left, and made his valets jump from one corner to another, fearing\r\nto come in for a chance slash. At last he somehow contrived to give\r\nhimself a severe blow on the cheek. The mark extended all along the left\r\nside of his face, and the blow was severe enough to make the blood\r\nstart. He was very much disturbed, fearing that he should not be able to\r\ngo out even by Easter; that the Empress should again forbid him to\r\ncommunicate, as his face was bloody; and that when she came to learn the\r\ncause of the accident, he should get some disagreeable reprimand for his\r\nwhipping amusements. He instantly ran to consult me, as he always did\r\nin such emergencies. Seeing him enter with his cheek all bloody, I\r\nexclaimed, \"Good heavens! what has happened to you?\" He told me. Having\r\nthought a little, I said, \"Well, perhaps I can manage the matter for\r\nyou; but, first of all, go to your room, and try if possible to prevent\r\nyour cheek from being seen by any one. I will come to you as soon as I\r\nhave got what I want, and I trust we shall so manage that no one will be\r\nthe wiser.\" He went off, and I recollected a preparation which had\r\nserved me some years before in a similar predicament. I had a fall in\r\nthe garden at Peterhoff, and took the skin off my face so that it bled;\r\nmy surgeon Gyon gave me some white lead in the form of pomade, and I\r\ncovered the wound with it, and went out as usual, without any one having\r\nperceived that I had scratched myself. I now sent for this pomade, and\r\nhaving received it, I went to the Grand Duke, and dressed his face so\r\nwell, that he could not detect anything himself by looking in the glass.\r\nOn the Thursday we received the communion, in company with the Empress,\r\nin the great church of the court, and then returned to our places. The\r\nlight fell on the Grand Duke's cheek. Tchoglokoff approached for some\r\npurpose or other, and looking at the Duke, said, \"Wipe your cheek, there\r\nis some pomatum on it.\" Instantly, as if in jest, I said to the Grand\r\nDuke, \"And I, who am your wife, forbid your doing it.\" The Grand Duke,\r\nturning to Tchoglokoff, said, \"See how these women treat us; we dare not\r\neven wipe our faces, if they do not like it.\" Tchoglokoff laughed,\r\nsaying, \"Well, this is indeed a woman's caprice!\" The matter rested\r\nthere, and the Duke felt grateful to me as well for the pomade which had\r\nspared him unpleasant results, as for my presence of mind, which had\r\nprevented all suspicion even in the case of M. Tchoglokoff.\r\n\r\nAs I had to be up before daylight on Easter morning, I went to bed about\r\nfive o'clock in the afternoon of Holy Saturday, intending to sleep till\r\nthe time arrived for dressing. Scarcely had I got into bed when the Duke\r\ncame running in in a violent hurry, telling me to make haste and get up\r\nto eat some fresh oysters, which had just been brought to him from\r\nHolstein. This was a great and double treat for him; first, because he\r\nwas fond of oysters, and, secondly, because they came from Holstein, his\r\nnative country, for which he had a great love, though he did not govern\r\nit any the better for that; for he both did, and was made to do,\r\nterrible things in it, as will be seen in the sequel. Not to get up\r\nwould have been to disoblige him, and risk a serious quarrel; I\r\ntherefore rose, dressed myself, and went to his apartments, though I was\r\nvery much fatigued by the devotional exercises of the Holy Week. When I\r\nreached his room, I found the oysters served. Having eaten a dozen of\r\nthem, I was allowed to return to bed, while he continued his repast.\r\nIndeed, he was all the better pleased by my not eating too many, as\r\nthere were more left for himself, for he was excessively greedy in the\r\nmatter of oysters. At midnight I got up, and dressed myself for the\r\nmatins and mass of Easter Sunday; but I could not remain till the end of\r\nthe service, for I was seized with a violent cholic. I never remember\r\nhaving had such severe pains. I returned to my room with no one but the\r\nPrincess Gagarine, all my people being in church. She assisted me to\r\nundress and get into bed, and sent for the doctors. I took medicine, and\r\nkept my bed during the first two days of the festival.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before this time that Count Bernis, Ambassador from the\r\nCourt of Vienna, Count Lynar, the Envoy of Denmark, and General Arnheim,\r\nEnvoy of Saxony, arrived in Russia. The latter brought with him his\r\nwife, who was by birth of the family of Hoim. Count Bernis was a native\r\nof Piedmont; he was intellectual, amiable, gay, and well educated, and\r\nof such a disposition that, although more than fifty years of age, young\r\npeople preferred his society to that of persons of their own age. He was\r\ngenerally loved and esteemed, and I have a thousand times said, that if\r\nhe, or some one like him, had been placed with the Grand Duke, the most\r\nbeneficial results would have followed, for the Duke as well as myself\r\nhad a very great regard and affection for him. In fact, the Duke said\r\nhimself, that with such a man near, a person would be ashamed of doing\r\nanything wrong or foolish--an excellent remark, which I have never\r\nforgotten. Count Bernis had with him, as attaché, Count Hamilton, a\r\nKnight of Malta. One day, when I made inquiries of this gentleman about\r\nthe health of the Ambassador Count Bernis, who was indisposed, it\r\noccurred to me to say that I had the highest opinion of Count Bathyani,\r\nwhom the Empress-Queen had just named tutor to her two elder sons, the\r\nArchdukes Joseph and Charles, since she had preferred him for this\r\noffice to Count Bernis. In the year 1780, when I had my first interview\r\nwith the Emperor Joseph II. at Mohilev, his Imperial Majesty told me\r\nthat he was aware I had made this remark. I replied that he must have\r\nlearnt this from Count Hamilton, who had been placed with him on his\r\nreturn from Russia. He then said that I had surmised correctly in the\r\ncase of Count Bathyani; for Count Bernis, whom he had not known, had\r\nleft the reputation of being better suited to the office than his old\r\ntutor.\r\n\r\nCount Lynar, the Envoy of the King of Denmark, had been sent to Russia\r\nto treat of the exchange of Holstein, which belonged to the Grand Duke,\r\nfor the country of Oldenburg. He was, according to report, a person of\r\nmuch information, and of no less capacity. His appearance was that of a\r\nmost complete fop. He was tall and well made, his hair fair with a tinge\r\nof red, and his complexion as delicately white as a woman's. It was said\r\nthat he took such care of his skin, that he never went to bed without\r\ncovering his face and hands with pomade, and also that he wore gloves\r\nand a mask at night. He boasted of having eighteen children, and\r\npretended that he had always put the nurses of those children in the\r\ncondition of continuing their vocation. This white Count wore the white\r\norder of Denmark, and dressed in the lightest colours; such as sky-blue,\r\napricot, lilac, flesh colour, &c., although such light shades were, at\r\nthat time, rarely worn by men. The High Chancellor, Count Bestoujeff,\r\nand his wife, treated him with the most marked favour. He was received\r\nat their house as one of the family, and greatly fêted. This, however,\r\ndid not shelter him from ridicule. There was also another point against\r\nhim, viz., that it was not forgotten that his brother had been more than\r\nwell-received by the Princess Anne, whose regency had been disapproved\r\nof. The Count had hardly arrived when he announced the object of his\r\nmission, which was, to negotiate an exchange of the duchy of Holstein\r\nfor the territory of Oldenburg. The High Chancellor sent for M. Pechlin,\r\nminister of the Grand Duke for his duchy of Holstein, and told him the\r\npurport of Count Lynar's mission. M. Pechlin made his report to the\r\nGrand Duke. The Duke was passionately attached to his country of\r\nHolstein. From the period of our stay in Moscow, it had been represented\r\nto her Imperial Majesty as insolvent. He had asked her for money for it,\r\nand she had given him a little, but it had never reached Holstein; it\r\nwent to pay the clamorous debts of his Imperial Highness in Russia. M.\r\nPechlin represented the affairs of Holstein, as far as pecuniary\r\nconsiderations were concerned, as desperate. This was easy for him to\r\ndo, as the Grand Duke depended upon him for the administration, and gave\r\nthe matter but little or no attention himself; so that, on one occasion,\r\nPechlin, quite out of patience, said to him, in slow and measured\r\naccents, \"My Lord, it depends on a sovereign to give his attention to\r\nthe government of his country, or not to do so. If he does not attend to\r\nit, the country governs itself, but it governs itself badly.\" This\r\nPechlin was a very short, fat man, wearing an immense wig, but he was\r\nnot deficient either in acquirements or capacity. This heavy and short\r\nbody enclosed a subtle and shrewd spirit; he was accused, however, of\r\nnot being over-delicate in his choice of means. The High Chancellor had\r\ngreat confidence in him; indeed, he was one of the persons most in his\r\nconfidence. M. Pechlin represented to the Duke that to listen was not to\r\nnegotiate, and that negotiation, also, was a very different thing from\r\nacceptance, and that he would always have it in his power to break off\r\nthe negotiation when he thought proper. At last, step by step, they got\r\nhim to consent that M. Pechlin should listen to the propositions of the\r\nDanish minister, and thus the negotiation was opened. The Grand Duke was\r\ndistressed, and spoke to me on the subject. I, who had been brought up\r\nin the ancient hatred of the house of Holstein against Denmark, and had\r\nconstantly heard it averred that the projects of Count Bestoujeff were\r\nall directed against the interests of the Grand Duke and myself, I, of\r\ncourse, could not hear of this project without impatience and anxiety. I\r\nopposed it to the Grand Duke as much as I could. No one, however, except\r\nhimself, ever mentioned the subject to me, and to him the utmost secrecy\r\nhad been recommended, especially in regard to women. I believe this\r\ncaution had more reference to me than to any one else, but they were\r\ndeceived in their expectations; for the Duke was always eager to tell me\r\neverything about it. The more the negotiations advanced, the more did\r\nthey endeavour to present the matter in an agreeable aspect to him. I\r\noften found him delighted at the prospect of what he should have, but\r\nthen came revulsions of bitter regret for what he was going to lose.\r\nWhen they saw him hesitating, they relaxed the conferences, and only\r\nrenewed them when they had invented some new bait for making him see\r\nthings in a favourable light.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the spring we moved to the Summer Garden, and\r\noccupied the little house built by Peter I, the apartments of which are\r\non a level with the garden. The stone quay, and the bridge of the\r\nFontanka, had not then been built. In this house I had one of the most\r\npainful annoyances which I experienced during the entire reign of the\r\nEmpress Elizabeth. One morning I was informed that the Empress had\r\nremoved from my service my old valet de chambre, Timothy Yevreinoff. The\r\npretext for this removal was, that Yevreinoff had had a quarrel, in a\r\nwardrobe chamber, with a man who used to bring us in coffee. Of this\r\nquarrel the Grand Duke had been in part a witness, having gone into the\r\nroom while they were arguing, and heard a portion of their mutual abuse.\r\nThe antagonist of Yevreinoff complained to M. Tchoglokoff, saying that\r\nYevreinoff, without regard to the presence of the Grand Duke, had used\r\nmost abusive language to him. M. Tchoglokoff immediately made his report\r\nto the Empress, who ordered both of them to be dismissed from the court,\r\nand Yevreinoff was sent off to Kasan, where he was subsequently made\r\nmaster of police. The truth of the matter was, that both men were very\r\nmuch attached to us, especially Yevreinoff, and this was but a pretext\r\nfor depriving me of him. He had charge of everything belonging to me.\r\nThe Empress ordered that a man named Skourine, whom he had taken in as\r\nan assistant, should take his place. In this person I had, at the time,\r\nno confidence.\r\n\r\nAfter some stay in the house of Peter I, we were ordered to the Summer\r\nPalace, which was built of wood. Here new apartments had been prepared\r\nfor us, one side of which faced the Fontanka, then a muddy marsh, while\r\nthe other opened on a miserable and narrow yard. On Whit-Sunday, the\r\nEmpress sent me word to invite Madame d'Arnheim, the wife of the Saxon\r\nEnvoy, to accompany me. She was a tall woman, very well made, about\r\nfive-and-twenty or six-and-twenty years of age, rather thin, and\r\nanything but handsome, for she was much and deeply marked by the\r\nsmall-pox; but, as she dressed well, she had, at some distance, a good\r\nappearance, and looked tolerably fair. She arrived at about five o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, dressed like a man, from head to foot, her coat being\r\nof red cloth, bordered with gold lace, and her vest of green gros de\r\nTours, similarly trimmed. She did not seem to know what to do with her\r\nhat or her hands, and appeared to us rather awkward. As I knew the\r\nEmpress did not like my riding as a man, I had had made for me a lady's\r\nsaddle, in the English style, and an English riding habit, of a rich\r\nazure and silvered cloth, with crystal buttons, which admirably\r\nimitated diamonds, while my black cap was surrounded with a string of\r\ndiamonds. I went down stairs to mount my horse. At this moment the\r\nEmpress came to our apartments to see us set off. As I was then very\r\nactive, and accustomed to this exercise, as soon as I reached my horse I\r\nleaped into the saddle, my petticoat, which was open, falling on each\r\nside. The Empress seeing me mount with such agility and address, cried\r\nout in astonishment, and said it was impossible to have done better. She\r\nasked what kind of saddle I was using, and having learned that it was a\r\nside-saddle, she said, \"One might have sworn it was a man's saddle.\"\r\nWhen Madame d'Arnheim's turn came, her skill did not shine very\r\nconspicuously in the eyes of her Imperial Majesty. Her own horse had\r\nbeen led from her house. It was a large, heavy, black and ugly-looking\r\nanimal, and our courtiers pretended that it must have been one of the\r\nleaders of her carriage. In order to mount, she was obliged to have the\r\naid of steps, and the ceremony was not effected without a deal of fuss,\r\nand the assistance of several people. When mounted, the animal broke\r\ninto a rough trot, which considerably shook the lady, who was neither\r\nfirm in her seat nor in her stirrups, so that she had to hold on by the\r\nsaddle. Seeing her mounted, I took the lead, and then--let those follow\r\nwho could. I overtook the Duke, who was a-head of me, and Madame\r\nd'Arnheim was left behind. I was told that the Empress laughed heartily,\r\nand was not at all pleased with Madame d'Arnheim's mode of riding. At\r\nlast, after losing, now her hat and then her stirrups, she was picked\r\nup, I believe, some distance from the court, by Madame Tchoglokoff, who\r\nwas in a carriage. Finally, she was brought to us at Catherinhoff; but\r\nthe adventure was not yet ended. It had rained during the day, up to\r\nthree o'clock in the afternoon, and the steps leading to Catherinhoff\r\nHouse were covered with pools of water. After dismounting, I remained\r\nfor some time in the hall, where a good deal of company had assembled.\r\nThen, wishing to reach the room where my women were, I thought I would\r\ngo by these open steps. Madame d'Arnheim must needs follow me, and as I\r\nwalked quickly, she was obliged to run. She thus stepped into these\r\npuddles, lost her footing, slipped, and fell flat upon the ground,\r\namidst the laughter of the crowd of spectators gathered about the steps.\r\nShe got up, a little confused, laying the blame on the new boots she had\r\nput on that afternoon. We returned from this excursion in a carriage,\r\nand, on the way, Madame d'Arnheim entertained us with a detail of the\r\ngood qualities of her steed; we had to bite our lips to prevent a burst\r\nof laughter. In a word, for many days she furnished a subject of\r\nmerriment to the whole court and town. My women asserted that she had\r\nfallen from trying to imitate me, without being equally nimble; and\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff, who was by no means given to mirth, used to laugh\r\ntill the tears came into her eyes, whenever any allusion was made to the\r\nsubject, and this for a long time afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom the Summer Palace we went to Peterhoff, where, this year, we\r\nresided at Monplaisir. We regularly spent a portion of our afternoons at\r\nthe residence of Madame Tchoglokoff, where, as there was always company,\r\nwe were tolerably well amused. From Peterhoff we went to Oranienbaum,\r\nwhere we hunted whenever the weather permitted, being sometimes thirteen\r\nhours a-day in the saddle. The summer, however, was rather wet. I\r\nremember one day, when returning home quite wet, that, as I was\r\ndismounting, I met my tailor, who said to me, \"When I see you in this\r\ncondition, I am not at all surprised that I can scarcely keep you in\r\nriding habits, and that new ones are continually required.\" The only\r\nmaterial I wore for this purpose was silk camlet. The rain made it\r\nsplit, the sun faded the colours, so that I was obliged to have a\r\nconstant succession of new habits. It was during this time that I\r\ncontrived for myself saddles on which I could sit in any way I pleased.\r\nThey had the English crook, and yet the leg could be passed over, so as\r\nto ride like a man. Besides, the crook divided, and a second stirrup\r\ncould be let down or raised at pleasure. If the equeries were asked how\r\nI was mounted, they said, \"Upon a lady's saddle,\" according to the\r\nwishes of the Empress. I never passed my leg over except I felt quite\r\nsure of not being betrayed; and as I made no boast of my invention,\r\nwhile, besides, my attendants were anxious to please me, no\r\ninconvenience resulted. The Grand Duke cared very little how I was\r\nmounted, while the equeries thought I ran less risk in riding astride,\r\nespecially as I was constantly in the chase, than I did in sitting on\r\nthe English saddles, which they detested, as they were always\r\napprehensive of some accident, the blame of which they would, in all\r\nprobability, have to bear. For myself, I cared little for the chase, but\r\nI was passionately fond of riding; and the more violent the exercise,\r\nthe more I liked it, so that if a horse happened to run away, I was sure\r\nto be after it and bring it back. At that period, also, I had always a\r\nbook in my pocket, and if I had a moment to myself, I spent it in\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nI noticed, in these huntings, that M. Tchoglokoff became a good deal\r\nsoftened in his manners, especially towards me. This made me fear that\r\nhe might take it into his head to pay his court to me--a thing which\r\nwould not have suited me in any manner. In the first place, I did not\r\nat all like him. He was fair and foppish, very stout, and as heavy in\r\nmind as in body. He was universally hated, while he was in no respect\r\nagreeable. His wife's jealousy and his own malignity were equally to be\r\nfeared, especially for one like me, who had nothing in the world to\r\ndepend on but myself and my merit, if I had any. I therefore evaded, and\r\nvery skilfully, I fancy, all the attentions of M. Tchoglokoff, without\r\never giving him any room for charging me with a want of politeness. All\r\nthis was perfectly seen through by his wife, who felt grateful for it,\r\nand subsequently became much attached to me, partly, as will be seen in\r\nthe sequel, from this cause.\r\n\r\nThere were in our court two chamberlains named Soltikoff, sons of the\r\nAdjutant-General Vasili Teodorovitch Soltikoff, whose wife, Mary\r\nAlexceëvna, born Princess Galitzine, the mother of these two young men,\r\nwas very much esteemed by the Empress, on account of the signal services\r\nshe had rendered her at the time of her accession to the throne, having\r\non that occasion given proofs of a rare fidelity and attachment.\r\nSergius, the younger of these sons, had been for some little time\r\nmarried to one of the Empress' maids of honour, named Matrena Pavlovna\r\nBalk. The elder brother was named Peter. He was a fool in the fullest\r\nsense of the word. He had the most stupid physiognomy I have ever seen,\r\ngreat staring eyes, a flat nose, and a mouth always half open; added to\r\nwhich he was a notorious tale-bearer, and as such welcome to the\r\nTchoglokoffs, at whose house it was that Madame Vladislava, in virtue of\r\nan old acquaintance with the mother of this sort of imbecile, suggested\r\nto the Tchoglokoffs the idea of marrying him to the Princess of\r\nCourland. In consequence, he placed himself in the ranks as a suitor,\r\nproposed to her and obtained her consent, while his parents demanded\r\nthat of the Empress. The Grand Duke knew nothing of all this until\r\neverything had been settled, that is, till our return to town. He was\r\nvery much annoyed, and very much out of humour with the Princess. I do\r\nnot know what excuse she gave him, but, although he disapproved of her\r\nmarriage, she continued for a long time to retain a portion of his\r\naffection, and some degree of influence with him. As for me, I was\r\ndelighted with this marriage, and had a superb dress embroidered for the\r\nintended. These court marriages, requiring the consent of the Empress,\r\nnever took place till after years of delay, because her Majesty herself\r\nfixed the day, forgot it, often for a long time, and, when reminded of\r\nit, put it off from time to time. This was the case in the present\r\ninstance. We returned then to town in autumn, and I had the satisfaction\r\nof seeing the Princess of Courland and M. Soltikoff thank her Majesty\r\nfor the consent she had been graciously pleased to give to their union.\r\nAfter all, the family of Soltikoff was one of the oldest and noblest in\r\nthe empire. It was even allied to the imperial family through the mother\r\nof the Empress Anne, who was a Soltikoff, but of a different branch to\r\nthe one in question; while M. Biren, created Duke of Courland by the\r\nfavour of the Empress Anne, was the son of a petty farmer on the estate\r\nof a gentleman in Courland. The name of this farmer was Biren; but the\r\nfavour enjoyed by the son in Russia induced the Birons of France, at the\r\npersuasion of Cardinal Fleury, to acknowledge him; for Fleury, anxious\r\nto gain over the court of Russia, favoured the views and vanity of\r\nBiren, Duke of Courland.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in town, we learnt that besides the two days a-week set\r\napart for French plays, there would also be, twice a-week, a masquerade\r\nball. The Grand Duke added another day for concerts in his own\r\napartments, and on Sundays there was generally a court. One of these\r\nmasquerade days was for the court exclusively, and for those whom the\r\nEmpress thought proper to admit; the other was for all the titled people\r\nwho happened to be in the city, down to the rank of colonel, as well as\r\nthose who served as officers in the guards. Sometimes, also, the whole\r\nof the nobility and the most considerable of the merchants were\r\nadmitted. The court balls did not exceed 160 to 200 people; those called\r\npublic received as many as 800.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at Moscow, in the year 1744, the Empress took a fancy to\r\nhave the court masquerades so arranged that all the men should dress as\r\nwomen, and all the women as men, no masks being worn. It was precisely a\r\ncourt day metamorphosed. The men wore large whale-boned petticoats, with\r\nwomen's gowns, and the head-dresses worn on court days, while the women\r\nappeared in the court costume of men. The men did not like these\r\nreversals of their sex, and the greater part of them were in the worst\r\npossible humour on these occasions, because they felt themselves to be\r\nhideous in such disguises. The women looked like scrubby little boys,\r\nwhilst the more aged amongst them had thick short legs, which were\r\nanything but ornamental. The only woman who looked really well, and\r\ncompletely a man, was the Empress herself. As she was very tall and\r\nsomewhat powerful, male attire suited her wonderfully well. She had the\r\nhandsomest leg I have ever seen with any man, and her foot was admirably\r\nproportioned. She danced to perfection, and everything she did had a\r\nspecial grace, equally so whether she dressed as a man or as a woman.\r\nOne always felt inclined to be looking at her, and turned away with\r\nregret because there was no object that could replace her. At one of\r\nthese balls I watched her while dancing a minuet. After she had ended it\r\nshe came to me. I took the liberty of saying that it was very fortunate\r\nfor the women she was not a man, and that her portrait alone, painted as\r\nshe then was, would be enough to turn many a head. She received my\r\ncompliment in very good part, and answered me in the same style, saying,\r\nin the most gracious manner possible, \"That were she a man, it would be\r\nto me that she would give the apple.\" I stooped to kiss her hand for a\r\ncompliment so unexpected. She embraced me, and every one was curious to\r\nknow what had passed between us. I made no secret of it to M.\r\nTchoglokoff, who whispered it to two or three others, and thus it passed\r\nfrom mouth to mouth until, in about a quarter of an hour, everybody knew\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring the last sojourn of the court at Moscow, Prince Youssoupoff,\r\nSenator and Chief of the Corps of Cadets, had the command-in-chief of\r\nthe city of St. Petersburg, where he remained during the absence of the\r\ncourt. For his amusement, and that of the principal persons about him,\r\nhe made his cadets play alternately the best tragedies; such as the\r\nRussian ones which Soumarokoff was then composing, and the French dramas\r\nof Voltaire. These latter were spoiled. On her return from Moscow, the\r\nEmpress ordered the dramas of Soumarokoff to be played at court by these\r\nyoung men. She took pleasure in witnessing these representations, and it\r\nwas soon noticed that she seemed to view them with more interest than\r\ncould have been expected. The theatre, which was set up in one of the\r\nhalls of the palace, was now transported into her own private\r\napartments. She took pleasure in dressing up the actors, had magnificent\r\ndresses made for them, and loaded them with her jewelry. It was\r\nparticularly noticed that the principal character, a rather handsome\r\nyoung man of eighteen or nineteen, was the most superbly dressed, as was\r\nnatural. Out of the theatre, also, he was observed to wear diamond\r\nbuckles, rings, watches, very expensive lace and linen. Finally, he left\r\nthe corps of cadets, and the Master of the Hounds, Count Razoumowsky,\r\nthe old favourite of the Empress, immediately took him for his adjutant,\r\nwhich office gave him the rank of captain. The courtiers at once drew\r\ntheir own inferences in their usual way, and made it out that\r\nRazoumowsky, in taking Beketoff as his adjutant, could have no other\r\nmotive than that of counterbalancing the favour enjoyed by M.\r\nSchouvaloff, gentleman of the bedchamber, who was known to be on no good\r\nterms with the Razoumowsky family; and, finally, it was concluded also,\r\nfrom the same circumstances, that this young man was coming into great\r\nfavour with the Empress. It was farther known that Count Razoumowsky had\r\nplaced with his new adjutant another messenger, in his service, named\r\nJohn Perfilievitch Yelagine, who was married to a former lady's-maid of\r\nthe Empress. She it was who had furnished the young man with the linen\r\nand lace just spoken of, and, as she was anything but rich, it was easy\r\nto believe that the money for this expenditure did not come from her own\r\npurse. No one was more disturbed by the rising favour of this young man\r\nthan my maid of honour, the Princess Gagarine, who was no longer young,\r\nand was anxious to make a suitable match. She had property of her own,\r\nbut was not handsome; she was, however, clever and manoeuvring. This\r\nwas the second time she had fixed her choice on a person who afterwards\r\nattained to the favour of the Empress. The first was M. Schouvaloff; the\r\nsecond, this Beketoff, of whom we are speaking. There were a number of\r\nyoung and handsome women connected with the Princess Gagarine; and,\r\nbesides, she belonged to an extensive family. All these accused M.\r\nSchouvaloff of being the secret cause of the constant reprimands which\r\nthe Princess received from her Majesty on the subject of dress, and the\r\nprohibitions issued, both to her and other young ladies, against\r\nwearing--sometimes one kind of dress, and sometimes another. In revenge\r\nfor all this, the Princess and all the prettiest women of the court said\r\neverything that was bad of M. Schouvaloff, whom they all now hated,\r\nalthough previously he had been a great favourite. He sought to mollify\r\nthem by showing them attentions, and saying pretty things to them,\r\nthrough his most intimate friends; but this was looked upon as an\r\nadditional offence, and he was repelled and ill-received on all hands.\r\nAll these ladies shunned him as they would the pestilence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Grand Duke had given me a little English barbet, which I\r\nhad asked him for. I had in my service a stove-heater, named Ivan\r\nOuchakoff, and my people took it into their heads to name my little\r\nspaniel after this man, calling him Ivan Ivanovitch. This barbet was a\r\nmost comical little creature; he walked upon his hind legs like a human\r\nbeing, and was in general exceedingly playful, so that we dressed him up\r\nin a different style every day, and the more he was bundled up the more\r\nplayful he became. He sat at table with us, had a napkin put round him,\r\nand eat out of his plate with great propriety. Then he turned his head\r\naround and asked for drink, by yelping to the person who stood behind\r\nhim. Sometimes he got upon the table to take something that suited him,\r\nsuch as a little pâté, a biscuit, or the like, which made the company\r\nlaugh. As he was small, and incommoded no one, he was suffered to do\r\nthese things, for he did not abuse the liberty allowed him, and was,\r\ntoo, very clean. This barbet amused us the whole of this winter. The\r\nfollowing summer we took him to Oranienbaum, and the Chamberlain\r\nSoltikoff, junior, having come there with his wife, both she and the\r\nother ladies of our court did nothing but sew and work for him, making\r\nall sorts of clothes and head-dresses, and disputing with each other for\r\nhis possession. At last, Madame Soltikoff got so fond of him, and the\r\ndog attached himself so much to her, that when she was going away he\r\nwould not leave her, and she was as little willing to leave him. She\r\nentreated me so earnestly to allow him to go with her, that I made her a\r\npresent of him. She took him under her arm, and went straight to the\r\nseat of her mother-in-law, who was then ill. This lady, seeing her\r\narrive with the dog, and noticing the antics which she made him play,\r\nasked his name, and learning that it was Ivan Ivanovitch, she could not\r\nhelp expressing her astonishment in the presence of many persons,\r\nbelonging to the court, who had come from Peterhoff to see her. These\r\nreturned to court, and, at the end of three or four days, the whole town\r\nwas filled with a marvellous story, to the effect that all the young\r\nladies who were hostile to M. Schouvaloff, had each a white barbet, to\r\nwhich, in derision of the favourite of the Empress, they gave the name\r\nof Ivan Ivanovitch, and which, also, they dressed in light colours, such\r\nas Schouvaloff was fond of wearing. Matters went so far that the Empress\r\nsignified to the parents of the young ladies, that she considered it\r\nimpertinent of them to permit such things. The white barbet at once\r\nchanged its name, but it continued to be caressed as before, and\r\nremained in the house of the Soltikoffs, cherished by its masters till\r\nthe day of its death, despite the imperial reprimand. In point of fact,\r\nthe whole story was a calumny. This one dog was the only one so named,\r\nand, in giving him this name, M. Schouvaloff was not thought of. As for\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff, who did not like the Schouvaloffs, she pretended not\r\nto have noticed the name of the dog, although she was constantly hearing\r\nit, and had herself given the animal many a little pâté, while laughing\r\nat its gambols.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter months of this winter, and the numerous balls and the\r\nmasquerades of the court, our two former gentlemen of the bedchamber,\r\nAlexander Villebois and Zachar Czernicheff, who had been placed as\r\ncolonels in the army, again made their appearance. As they were\r\nsincerely attached to me, I was very glad to see and receive them; while\r\nthey, on their part, neglected no opportunity of giving me evidences of\r\ntheir affectionate devotion. I was at that time very fond of dancing. At\r\nthe public balls I generally changed my dress three times; my _parure_\r\nwas very _recherchée_, and if the masquerade dress which I wore happened\r\nto attract general approbation, I was certain never to wear it again;\r\nfor it was a rule with me that if once it produced a great effect, it\r\ncould not fail to produce an inferior one on a second occasion. In the\r\ncourt balls, at which the public did not assist, I dressed as simply as\r\nI could, and in so doing pleased the Empress, who did not like too much\r\ndisplay on these occasions. However, when the ladies were ordered to\r\nappear in male attire, I dressed magnificently, my clothes being richly\r\nembroidered on every seam, or otherwise in very refined taste, and this\r\npassed without criticism, nay, even pleased the Empress; why I do not\r\nvery well know. It must be confessed that at that period the efforts of\r\ncoquetry were pushed to the extreme at this court; it was a constant\r\nstruggle for distinction in splendour and elegance of dress. I remember,\r\non the occasion of one of those masked balls, that every one was\r\npreparing new and most magnificent dresses, and, despairing of eclipsing\r\nothers in this respect, the idea occurred to me of taking an opposite\r\ncourse. I put on a bodice of white gros de Tours (at that time I had a\r\nvery fine shape), with a petticoat of the same, over a very small hoop.\r\nMy hair, which was then very long, thick, and beautiful, was arranged\r\nbehind my head, and tied with a white ribbon, _en queue de renard_. A\r\nsingle rose, with its bud and leaves, was the only ornament I wore in\r\nit; another was placed in my corset; they imitated nature so perfectly\r\nas scarcely to be distinguished from the real. Round my neck was a ruff\r\nof very white gauze, which with cuffs and an apron of the same material,\r\ncompleted my costume. Thus attired, I went to the ball, and the moment I\r\nentered I saw plainly that all eyes were fixed on me. I crossed the\r\ngallery without stopping, and entered the corresponding apartments\r\nbeyond it. Here I met the Empress, who instantly exclaimed, \"Good God,\r\nhow simple! What, not even a patch!\"[10] I laughed, and said I did not\r\nwish to add to the weight of my dress. She drew from her pocket her box\r\nof patches, and choosing one of moderate size, applied it to my face. On\r\nleaving her I hastened to the gallery, where I pointed out my patch to\r\nmy more intimate friends. I did the same to the favourites of the\r\nEmpress, and, as I was in high spirits, I danced more than usual. I\r\nnever in my life remember to have been so highly complimented as on that\r\noccasion. I was said to be beautiful as the day--dazzlingly brilliant. I\r\nnever, indeed, thought myself so very handsome, but I was pleasing; and\r\nit was in this point, I think, that my forte lay. I returned home very\r\nwell satisfied with my plan of simplicity, while all the other costumes\r\nwere of rare magnificence.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of amusements like these that the year 1750 came to\r\na close. Madame d'Arnheim danced better than she rode; and I remember,\r\non one occasion, that we tried which of us would be soonest tired. It\r\nturned out to be her. She was obliged to sit down, and acknowledge that\r\nshe could not hold out any longer, while I still went on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM 1751, TO THE END OF 1758.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1751 the Grand Duke, who, like myself, felt\r\ngreat esteem and affection for the Count de Bernis, Ambassador from the\r\nCourt of Vienna, determined to consult him relative to the state of his\r\naffairs in Holstein, to the debts which burdened that country, and the\r\nnegotiations opened by Denmark, to which he had consented to listen. He\r\ndesired me also to mention the subject to the Count. I said I would not\r\nfail to do so, since it was his wish. On the occasion of the next\r\nmasquerade ball, therefore, I approached Count de Bernis, who was\r\nstanding near the balustrade, within which the dance was going on, and\r\ntold him that the Grand Duke had ordered me to speak to him respecting\r\nthe affairs of Holstein. The Count listened to me with great interest\r\nand attention. I told him frankly that being young and without advisers,\r\nhaving probably also but inaccurate notions of business affairs, and no\r\nexperience to advance in my favour, my ideas, such as they were, were my\r\nown; that I might be very deficient in information, but that it appeared\r\nto me, in the first place, that the affairs of Holstein were not so\r\ndesperate as some sought to represent them; that, besides, as to the\r\nexchange itself, I could very well understand that it might be more\r\nadvantageous to Russia than to the Grand Duke personally; that\r\nassuredly, as heir to the throne, the interests of the empire ought to\r\nbe dear to him; that if for these interests it was necessary to abandon\r\nHolstein in order to put an end to interminable discussions with\r\nDenmark, then the only question would be to choose, before giving it up,\r\na favourable moment for the surrender; that to me the present time did\r\nnot appear to be such, either as regarded the interest or personal\r\ncredit of the Grand Duke; that, however, a time might come when\r\ncircumstances would render this act more important and more creditable\r\nto him, and, perhaps, also more advantageous for the empire of Russia\r\nitself; but that at present the whole affair had a manifest air of\r\nintrigue, which, if it proved successful, would give an impression of\r\nfeebleness on the part of the Grand Duke, from which he might suffer all\r\nhis life in the estimation of the public; that it was but a few days, so\r\nto speak, since he had undertaken the management of that country; that\r\nhe was extremely fond of the country, and yet, notwithstanding all this,\r\nhe had been persuaded to exchange it, without very well knowing why, for\r\nthe territory of Oldenburg, with which he was not at all acquainted, and\r\nwhich was still farther off from Russia; and that, besides, the port of\r\nKiel, if in the hands of the Grand Duke, might be important for Russian\r\nnavigation. The Count de Bernis entered into all my reasonings, and\r\nsaid, in conclusion, \"As Ambassador, I have no instructions on this\r\nmatter, but as Count Bernis, I think you are right.\" The Grand Duke told\r\nme afterwards that the Ambassador said to him, \"All I can say to you in\r\nthis matter is, that I think your wife is right, and that you will do\r\nwell to listen to her.\" The Grand Duke consequently cooled very much\r\nupon the subject, and this, probably, was noticed, for it began to be\r\nmentioned to him more rarely.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter we went, as usual, for some time to the Summer Palace at\r\nPeterhoff, where, year by year, our stay became abridged. This year an\r\noccurrence took place which furnished the courtiers with matter for\r\ngossip: it was caused by the intrigues of the Messieurs Schouvaloff.\r\nColonel Beketoff, of whom I have spoken above, not knowing what to do\r\nwith himself during the favour which he enjoyed, although it increased\r\nto such a point that, from day to day, people were waiting to see which\r\nof the two would yield his place to the other, that is to say, Beketoff\r\nto John Schouvaloff, or the latter to Beketoff--not knowing, as I have\r\nsaid, how to amuse himself, it occurred to him to have the Empress'\r\nchoir of singing boys perform at his own residence. In several of them\r\nhe took a special interest, on account of the beauty of their voices;\r\nand as both himself and his friend Yelagine were versifiers, they\r\ncomposed songs which the children sung. To this an odious interpretation\r\nwas given; for it was well known that nothing was more detested by the\r\nEmpress than vice of such a nature. Beketoff, in the innocence of his\r\nheart, would walk in the garden with these children; this was imputed to\r\nhim as a crime. The Empress went away to Zarskoe-Selo for a couple of\r\ndays, and then returned to Peterhoff, where M. Beketoff received orders\r\nto remain, under the plea of indisposition. He did, in fact, remain\r\nthere with Yelagine, caught there a violent fever, which threatened his\r\nlife, and in the ravings of his delirium, did nothing but talk about the\r\nEmpress, with whom he was thoroughly taken up. He recovered; but he\r\nremained in disgrace, and retired, after which he was placed in the\r\narmy, where he was not successful. He was too effeminate for the\r\nprofession of arms.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile we proceeded to Oranienbaum, where we went hunting\r\nevery day. Towards autumn, in the month of September, we returned to the\r\ncity. The Empress placed at our court M. Leon Narichkine as gentleman of\r\nthe bedchamber. He immediately hastened from Moscow with his mother, his\r\nbrother, his brother's wife, and his three sisters. He was one of the\r\nmost singular persons I have ever known, and no one has ever made me\r\nlaugh so much as he has done. He was a born harlequin, and had he not\r\nbeen by birth what he was, he might have gained a subsistence, and a\r\nhandsome one too, by his extraordinary talent for humour. He was not at\r\nall wanting in understanding. He had heard of everything, and everything\r\narranged itself in his head after a fashion of his own. He could give a\r\ndissertation on any art or science he chose. He would employ all the\r\ntechnical terms belonging to his subject, and would talk to you for a\r\nquarter of an hour or more without stopping; and at the end, neither\r\nhimself nor any one else would understand anything of the string of\r\nwords which had flowed so readily from his lips, and the whole, of\r\ncourse, would finish with a general burst of laughter. Among other\r\nthings he said of history, that he did not like history in which there\r\nwere _histories_,[11] and that in order that a history should be good it\r\nmust be devoid of _history_, that otherwise history became mere rant.\r\n\r\nBut it was on politics that he was inimitable. When he began on this\r\nsubject, it was impossible for any one, however serious, to resist him.\r\nHe used to say, too, that of well-written plays the greater part were\r\nvery wearisome.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he been appointed to the court when the Empress sent\r\norders to his eldest sister to marry a M. Seniavine, who, for that\r\npurpose, was placed in our court as gentleman of the bedchamber. This\r\nwas a thunderbolt for the young lady, who consented to this marriage\r\nwith the greatest repugnance. It was very ill received by the public\r\nalso, and all the blame of it was cast on M. Schouvaloff, the favourite\r\nof the Empress, who, before his rise to favour, had been very partial to\r\nthis young lady, for whom they made up this bad match in order that he\r\nmight lose sight of her. This was a species of persecution truly\r\ntyrannical. At last she married, became consumptive, and died.\r\n\r\nBy the end of September, we returned to the Winter Palace. The court was\r\nat this time so badly off for furniture that the same mirrors, beds,\r\nchairs, tables, and drawers which served us at the Winter Palace, passed\r\nwith us to the Summer Palace, and thence to Peterhoff, following us even\r\nto Moscow. A good number were broken and cracked in these different\r\njourneys, and, in this state of dilapidation, they were supplied to us;\r\nso that it was difficult to make use of them, while to get others an\r\nexpress order from the Empress was required. As she was almost always\r\nvery difficult of access, if not inaccessible, I resolved to buy, by\r\ndegrees, with my own money, chests of drawers and the other more\r\nnecessary articles of furniture, as well for the Winter as the Summer\r\nPalace; so that when I passed from the one house to the other, I found\r\neverything I wanted without difficulty and without the inconveniences of\r\ntransport. The Grand Duke was pleased with this arrangement, and he made\r\na similar one in his own apartments. As for Oranienbaum, which belonged\r\nto the Grand Duke, we had, at my cost, everything we needed in my\r\nprivate apartments. I procured all this at my own expense in order to\r\navoid all dispute and difficulty; for his Imperial Highness, although\r\nvery lavish where his own fancies were concerned, was not at all so in\r\nanything that regarded me; and generally he was anything but liberal.\r\nBut as all I did in my own apartments and with my own purse served to\r\nembellish his house, he was quite content with it.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer Madame Tchoglokoff conceived such a special and real\r\naffection for me, that on our return to the capital she could not do\r\nwithout me, and was quite _ennuyée_ when I was not with her. The cause\r\nof this affection arose from my not responding to the advances which it\r\nhad pleased her husband to make to me--a circumstance which gave me a\r\npeculiar merit in the eyes of his wife. When we returned to the Winter\r\nPalace, Madame Tchoglokoff invited me almost every evening to her rooms.\r\nThere were not many people there, but always more than in my room, where\r\nI sat quite alone reading, except when the Grand Duke came in to walk up\r\nand down at a rapid pace, talking about things which interested himself,\r\nbut which had no value in my eyes. These promenades would last one or\r\ntwo hours, and were repeated several times a-day. I was obliged to walk\r\nwith him till my strength was quite exhausted, to listen with attention,\r\nand to answer him, though, for the most part, what he said had neither\r\nhead nor tail; for he often gave the reins to his imagination. I\r\nremember that, during one whole winter, he was taken up with a project\r\nof building, near to Oranienbaum, a pleasure-house in the form of a\r\nconvent of Capuchins, where he and I and all his suite should be dressed\r\nas Capuchins. This dress he thought charming and convenient. Every one\r\nwas to have a donkey, and, in his turn, take this donkey and fetch water\r\nand bring provisions to the so-called convent. He used to laugh till he\r\nwas ready to drop at the idea of the admirable and amusing effects which\r\nthis invention was to produce. He made me draw a pencil-sketch of the\r\nplan of this precious work, and every day I had to add or remove\r\nsomething. However determined I was to comply with his humours, and bear\r\neverything with patience, I frankly avow that I was very often worn out\r\nwith the annoyance of these visits, promenades, and conversations, which\r\nwere insipid beyond anything I have ever seen. When he was gone, the\r\nmost tiresome book appeared a delightful amusement.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of autumn, the balls for the court and the public\r\nrecommenced, as did also the rage for splendour and refinement in\r\nmasquerade dresses. Count Zachar Czernicheff returned to St. Petersburg.\r\nAs, on the ground of old acquaintance, I always treated him very well,\r\nit rested only with myself to give what interpretation I pleased to his\r\nattentions this time. He began by telling me that I had grown much\r\nhandsomer. It was the first time in my life that anything of the kind\r\nhad been said to me. I did not take it ill. Nay, more; I was credulous\r\nenough to believe that he spoke the truth. At every ball there was some\r\nfresh remark of this kind. One day, the Princess Gagarine brought me a\r\ndevice from him, and, on breaking it, I perceived that it had been\r\nopened and gummed together again. The motto, as usual, was printed, but\r\nit consisted of a couple of verses, very tender and full of sentiment.\r\nAfter dinner, I had some devices brought to me. I looked for a motto\r\nwhich might serve as an answer, without compromising myself. I found\r\none, put it into a device representing an orange, and gave it to the\r\nPrincess Gagarine, who delivered it to Count Czernicheff. Next morning\r\nshe brought me another from him; but this time I found a motto of some\r\nlines, in his own hand. I answered it, and there we were in regular and\r\nquite sentimental correspondence. At the next masquerade, while dancing\r\nwith him, he said he had a thousand things to tell me which he could not\r\ntrust to paper, nor put in a device, which the Princess Gagarine might\r\nbreak in her pocket or lose on the way; and he entreated me to grant him\r\na moment's audience either in my chamber, or wherever I might deem\r\nsuitable. I told him that that was an utter impossibility, that my rooms\r\nwere inaccessible, and that it was also impossible for me to leave them.\r\nHe told me that he would, if necessary, disguise himself as a servant;\r\nbut I refused point-blank, and so the matter went no farther than this\r\nsecret correspondence by means of devices. At last the Princess Gagarine\r\nbegan to suspect its character, scolded me for making use of her, and\r\nwould not receive any more of these missives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1752.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmid these occurrences the year 1751 came to a close, and 1752 began. At\r\nthe end of the Carnival, Count Czernicheff left to join his regiment. A\r\nfew days before his departure I required to be bled; it was on a\r\nSaturday. The following Wednesday, M. Tchoglokoff invited me to his\r\nisland, at the mouth of the Neva. He had a house there, consisting of a\r\nsaloon in the centre and some chambers on the sides. Near this house he\r\nhad some slides prepared. On arriving, I found there the Count Roman\r\nVoronzoff, who, on seeing me, said, \"I have just the thing for you; I\r\nhave had an excellent little sledge made for the slides.\" As he had\r\noften taken me before, I accepted his offer, and the sledge was at once\r\nbrought. In it was a kind of small fauteuil, on which I seated myself.\r\nHe placed himself behind me, and we began to descend; but about half-way\r\ndown the incline, the Count was no longer master of the sledge, and it\r\noverturned. I fell, and the Count, who was heavy and clumsy, fell on me,\r\nor rather on my left arm, in which I had been bled some four or five\r\ndays before. We got up, and walked towards one of the court sledges,\r\nwhich was in waiting for those who descended to convey them back to the\r\npoint from which they had started, so that any who wished might\r\nrecommence the descent. While sitting in this sledge with the Princess\r\nGagarine, who, with Prince Ivan Czernicheff, had followed me, the\r\nlatter, together with Voronzoff, standing behind the sleigh, I felt a\r\nsensation of warmth spreading over my left arm, the cause of which I\r\ncould not make out. I passed my right hand into the sleeve of my pelisse\r\nto see what was the matter, and having withdrawn it, I found it covered\r\nwith blood. I told the Counts and the Princess that I thought my vein\r\nhad reopened. They made the sleigh move faster, and instead of going\r\nagain to the slides, we went to the house. There we found no one but a\r\nbutler. I took off my pelisse, the butler gave me some vinegar, and\r\nCount Czernicheff performed the office of surgeon. We all agreed not to\r\nsay a word about this adventure. As soon as my arm was set to rights, we\r\nreturned to the slides. I danced the rest of the evening, then supped,\r\nand we returned home very late, without any one having the least idea of\r\nwhat had happened to me. However, the skin did not join smoothly for\r\nnearly a month; but it got all right by degrees.\r\n\r\nDuring Lent I had a violent altercation with Madame Tchoglokoff, the\r\ncause of which was as follows: My mother had been for some time in\r\nParis. The eldest son of General Ivan Fedorovitch Gleboff, upon his\r\nreturn from that capital, brought me, from her, two pieces of very rich\r\nand very beautiful stuff. While looking at them in my dressing-room, in\r\nthe presence of Skourine, who unfolded them, I chanced to say that they\r\nwere so beautiful that I felt tempted to present them to the Empress;\r\nand I really was watching an opportunity of speaking of them to her\r\nMajesty, whom I saw but very rarely, and then, too, mostly in public. I\r\nsaid nothing about them to Madame Tchoglokoff. It was a present I\r\nreserved for myself to make. I forbade Skourine to mention to any one\r\nwhat had fallen from my lips in his hearing. Skourine, however, went\r\ninstantly to Madame Tchoglokoff, and told her what I had said. A few\r\ndays afterwards, Madame Tchoglokoff came into my room and told me that\r\nthe Empress sent me her thanks for my stuffs; that she had kept one of\r\nthem and returned the other. I was thunderstruck on hearing this. I said\r\nto her, \"How is this, Madame Tchoglokoff?\" Upon this she stated that she\r\nhad carried the stuffs to the Empress, having heard that I intended them\r\nfor her Majesty. For the moment I felt vexed beyond measure, more so\r\nindeed than I ever remember to have been before. I stammered; I could\r\nscarcely speak. However, I said that I had proposed to myself a treat in\r\npresenting these things to the Empress myself, and that she had deprived\r\nme of this pleasure by carrying them off without my knowledge, and\r\npresenting them in that fashion to her Imperial Majesty; I reminded her\r\nthat she could not know my intentions, as I had never spoken of them to\r\nher, or that if she was aware of them, it was only from the mouth of a\r\ntreacherous servant, who had betrayed his mistress, who daily loaded him\r\nwith kindness. Madame Tchoglokoff, who always had reasons of her own,\r\nreplied, and maintained that I ought never speak to the Empress myself\r\nabout anything; that she had signified to me the order of her Imperial\r\nMajesty to this effect, and that my servants were in duty bound to\r\nreport to her all that I said; that, consequently, Skourine had only\r\ndone his duty, and she hers, in carrying, without my knowledge, to her\r\nMajesty the stuffs I had destined for her, and that the whole matter was\r\nquite in rule. I let her speak on, for rage stopped my utterance. At\r\nlast she went away. I then entered a small ante-chamber, where Skourine\r\ngenerally remained in the morning, and where my clothes were kept, and\r\nseeing him there, I gave him, with all my force, a well-aimed and heavy\r\nbox on the ear. I told him he was a traitor, and the most ungrateful of\r\nmen, for having dared to repeat to Madame Tchoglokoff what I had\r\nforbidden him to speak about; that I had loaded him with kindnesses,\r\nwhile he betrayed me even in such innocent words; that from that day\r\nforward I would never give him anything more, but would get him\r\ndismissed and well beaten. I asked him what he expected to gain by such\r\nconduct, telling him that I should always remain what I was, while the\r\nTchoglokoffs, hated and detested by every one, would, in the end, get\r\nthemselves dismissed by the Empress herself, who most assuredly would\r\nsooner or later discover their intense stupidity, and utter unfitness\r\nfor the position in which the intrigues of a wicked man had placed them;\r\nthat, if he chose, he might go and repeat to them all I had said; that\r\nhe could not injure me by so doing, while he would soon see what would\r\nbecome of himself. The man fell at my feet crying bitterly, and begged\r\nmy pardon with a repentance which appeared to me sincere. I was touched\r\nby it, and told him that his future conduct would show me what course I\r\nmust take with him, and that by his behaviour I would regulate my own.\r\nHe was an intelligent fellow, by no means deficient in character, and\r\none who never broke his word to me. On the contrary, I have had the best\r\nproofs of his zeal and fidelity in the most difficult times. I\r\ncomplained to every one I could of the trick Madame Tchoglokoff had\r\nplayed me, in order that the matter might reach the Empress' ears. The\r\nEmpress, when she saw me, thanked me for my present, and I learned from\r\na third party, that she disapproved of the way in which Madame\r\nTchoglokoff had acted. And thus the matter ended.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter we went to the Summer Palace. I had observed for some time\r\nthat the Chamberlain, Serge Soltikoff, was more assiduous than usual in\r\nhis attendance at court. He always came there in company with Leon\r\nNarichkine, who amused every one by his originality, of which I have\r\nalready reported several traits. Serge Soltikoff was the aversion of the\r\nPrincess Gagarine, of whom I was very fond, and in whom I even reposed\r\nconfidence. Leon Narichkine was looked upon as a person of no sort of\r\nconsequence, but very original. Soltikoff insinuated himself as much as\r\npossible into the good graces of the Tchoglokoffs. As these people were\r\nneither amiable, nor clever, nor amusing, he must have had some secret\r\nobject in these attentions. Madame Tchoglokoff was at this time\r\npregnant, and frequently indisposed. As she pretended that I amused her\r\nduring the summer quite as much as in the winter, she often requested me\r\nto visit her. Soltikoff, Leon Narichkine, the Princess Gagarine, and\r\nsome others, were generally at her apartments, whenever there was not a\r\nconcert at the Grand Duke's, or theatricals at court. The concerts were\r\nvery wearisome to M. Tchoglokoff, who always assisted at them; but\r\nSoltikoff discovered a singular mode of keeping him occupied. I cannot\r\nconceive how he contrived to excite in a man so dull, and so utterly\r\ndevoid of talent and imagination, a passion for versifying and composing\r\nsongs which had not even common sense. But having made this discovery,\r\nwhenever anyone wished to get rid of M. Tchoglokoff, it was only\r\nnecessary to ask him to make a new song. Then, with much _empressement_,\r\nhe would go and sit down in a corner of the room, generally near the\r\nstove, and set to work upon his song--a business which took up the\r\nevening. The song would be pronounced charming, and thus he was\r\ncontinually encouraged to make new ones. Leon Narichkine used to set\r\nthem to music, and sing them with him; and while all this was going on,\r\nwe conversed without restraint. I once had a large book of these songs,\r\nbut I know not what has become of it.\r\n\r\nDuring one of these concerts, Serge Soltikoff gave me to understand what\r\nwas the object of his assiduous attentions. I did not reply to him at\r\nfirst. When he again returned to the subject, I asked him what it was he\r\nwanted of me? Hereupon he drew a charming and passionate picture of the\r\nhappiness which he promised himself. I said to him, \"But your wife, whom\r\nyou married for love only two years ago, and of whom you were supposed\r\nto be passionately fond--and she, too, of you--what will she say to\r\nthis?\" He replied that all was not gold that glitters, and that he was\r\npaying dearly for a moment of infatuation. I did all I could to make him\r\nchange his mind--I really expected to succeed in this--I pitied him.\r\nUnfortunately, I listened also. He was very handsome, and certainly had\r\nnot his equal at the Imperial court, still less at ours. He was not\r\nwanting in mind, nor in that finish of accomplishments, manner, and\r\nstyle which the great world gives, and especially a court. He was\r\ntwenty-six years old. Take him all in all, he was by birth, and by many\r\nother qualities, a distinguished gentleman. As for his faults, he\r\nmanaged to hide them. The greatest of all was a love of intrigue and a\r\nwant of principle. These were not unfolded to my eyes. I held out all\r\nthe spring, and a part of the autumn. I saw him almost every day, and\r\nmade no change in my conduct towards him. I was the same to him as I was\r\nto all others, and never saw him but in the presence of the court, or of\r\na part of it. One day, to get rid of him, I made up my mind to tell him\r\nthat he was misdirecting his attentions. I added, \"How do you know that\r\nmy heart is not engaged elsewhere?\" This, however, instead of\r\ndiscouraging him, only made his pursuit all the more ardent. In all this\r\nthere was no thought of the dear husband, for it was a known and\r\nadmitted fact, that he was not at all amiable, even to the objects with\r\nwhom he was in love; and he was always in love; in fact, he might be\r\nsaid to pay court to every woman, except the one who bore the name of\r\nhis wife; she alone was excluded from all share of his attentions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, Tchoglokoff invited us to a hunting party on\r\nhis island, whither we went in a skiff, our horses being sent on before.\r\nImmediately on our arrival I mounted my horse, and we went to find the\r\ndogs. Soltikoff seized the moment when the rest were in pursuit of the\r\nhares to approach me and speak of his favourite subject. I listened more\r\nattentively than usual. He described to me the plan which he had\r\narranged for enshrouding, as he said, in profound mystery, the happiness\r\nwhich might be enjoyed in such a case. I did not say a word. He took\r\nadvantage of my silence to persuade me that he loved me passionately,\r\nand he begged that I would allow him to hope, at least, that he was not\r\nwholly indifferent to me. I told him he might amuse himself with hoping\r\nwhat he pleased, as I could not prevent his thoughts. Finally he drew\r\ncomparisons between himself and others at the court, and made me confess\r\nthat he was preferable to them. From that he concluded that he was\r\npreferred. I laughed at all this, but I admitted that he was agreeable\r\nto me. At the end of an hour and a-half's conversation, I desired him to\r\nleave me, since so long a conversation might give rise to suspicion. He\r\nsaid he would not go unless I told him that I consented. I answered,\r\n\"Yes, yes; but go away.\" He said, \"Then it is settled,\" and put spurs to\r\nhis horse. I cried after him, \"No, no;\" but he repeated, \"Yes, yes.\" And\r\nthus we separated. On our return to the house, which was on the island,\r\nwe had supper, during which there sprung up such a heavy gale from the\r\nsea, that the waves rose so high that they even reached the steps of the\r\nhouse. In fact, the whole island was under water to the depth of several\r\nfeet. We were obliged to remain until the storm had abated, and the\r\nwaters retreated, which was not until between two and three in the\r\nmorning. During this time, Soltikoff told me that heaven itself had\r\nfavoured him that day, by enabling him to enjoy my presence for a longer\r\ntime, with many other things to the same effect. He thought himself\r\nalready quite happy. As for me, I was not at all so. A thousand\r\napprehensions troubled me, and I was unusually dull, and very much out\r\nof conceit with myself. I had persuaded myself that I could easily\r\ngovern both his passions and my own, and I found that both tasks were\r\ndifficult, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, Soltikoff informed me that one of the Grand Duke's\r\nvalets de chambre, Bressan, a Frenchman, had told him that his Imperial\r\nHighness had said in his room, \"Sergius Soltikoff and my wife deceive\r\nTchoglokoff, make him believe whatever they like, and then laugh at\r\nhim.\" To tell the truth, there was something of this kind, and the Grand\r\nDuke had perceived it. I answered, by advising him to be more\r\ncircumspect for the future. Some days afterwards I caught a very bad\r\nsore throat, which lasted more than three weeks, with a violent fever,\r\nduring which the Empress sent to me the Princess Kourakine, who was\r\nabout to be married to Prince Lobanoff. I was to dress her hair. For\r\nthis purpose she had to sit on my bed, in her court-dress and hooped\r\npetticoats. I did my best; but Madame Tchoglokoff, seeing that it was\r\nimpossible for me to manage it, made her get off my bed, and finished\r\ndressing her herself. I have never seen the lady since then.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke was at this period making love to Mademoiselle Martha\r\nIsaevna Schafiroff, whom the Empress had recently placed with me, as\r\nalso her elder sister, Anna Isaevna. Serge Soltikoff, who was a devil\r\nfor intrigue, insinuated himself into the favour of these girls, in\r\norder to learn anything the Grand Duke might say to them relative to\r\nhim. These young ladies were poor, rather silly, and very selfish, and,\r\nin fact, they became wonderfully confidential in a very short time.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this we went to Oranienbaum, where again I was every\r\nday on horseback, and wore no other than a man's dress, except on\r\nSundays. Tchoglokoff and his wife had become as gentle as lambs. In the\r\neyes of Madame Tchoglokoff I possessed a new merit; I fondled and\r\ncaressed a great deal one of her children, who was with her. I made\r\nclothes for him, and gave him all sorts of playthings and dresses. Now\r\nthe mother was dotingly fond of this child, who subsequently became such\r\na scapegrace that, for his pranks, he was sentenced to confinement in a\r\nfortress for fifteen years. Soltikoff had become the friend, the\r\nconfidant and the counsellor of M. and Madame Tchoglokoff. Assuredly no\r\nperson in his senses could ever have submitted to so hard a task as that\r\nof listening to two proud, arrogant, and conceited fools, talking\r\nnonsense all day long, without having some great object in view. Many,\r\ntherefore, were the guesses, many the suppositions, as to what this\r\nobject could be. These reached Peterhoff and the ears of the Empress.\r\nNow at this period it often happened that when her Majesty wished to\r\nscold any one, she did not scold for what she might well complain of,\r\nbut seized some pretext for finding fault about something which no one\r\nwould ever have thought she could object to. This is the remark of a\r\ncourtier; I have it from the lips of its author, Zachar Czernicheff. At\r\nOranienbaum, every one of our suite had agreed, men as well as women, to\r\nhave, for this summer, dresses of the same colour; the body gray, the\r\nrest blue, with a collar of black velvet, and no trimmings. This\r\nuniformity was convenient in more respects than one. It was on this\r\nstyle of dress that she fixed, and more especially on the circumstance\r\nthat I always wore a riding habit, and rode like a man at Peterhoff. One\r\ncourt day the Empress said to Madame Tchoglokoff that this fashion of\r\nriding prevented my having children, and that my dress was not at all\r\nbecoming; that when she rode on horseback she changed her dress. Madame\r\nTchoglokoff replied, that as to having children, this had nothing to do\r\nwith the matter; that children could not come without a cause; and that,\r\nalthough their Imperial Highnesses had been married ever since 1745, the\r\ncause nevertheless did not exist. Thereupon her Imperial Majesty\r\nscolded Madame Tchoglokoff, and told her she blamed her for this,\r\nbecause she neglected to lecture, on this matter, the parties concerned;\r\nand on the whole, she showed much ill-humour, and said that her husband\r\nwas a mere night-cap, who allowed himself to be worn by a set of\r\ndirty-nosed brats (_des morveux_). All this, in four-and-twenty hours,\r\nhad reached their confidants. At this term of _morveux_, the _morveux_\r\nwiped their noses; and, in a very special council held on the matter by\r\nthem, it was resolved and decreed that, in order to follow out strictly\r\nthe wishes of her Imperial Majesty, Sergius Soltikoff and Leon\r\nNarichkine should incur a pretended disgrace at the hands of M.\r\nTchoglokoff, of which perhaps he himself would not be at all aware; that\r\nunder pretext of the illness of their relatives, they should retire to\r\ntheir homes for three weeks or a month, in order to allow the rumours\r\nwhich were current to die away. This was carried out to the letter, and\r\nthe next day they departed, to confine themselves to their own houses\r\nfor a month. As for me, I immediately changed my style of dress;\r\nbesides, the other had now become useless. The first idea of this\r\nuniformity of attire had been suggested to us by the dress worn on\r\ncourt-days at Peterhoff. The body was white, the rest green, and the\r\nwhole trimmed all over with silver lace. Soltikoff, who was of a dark\r\ncomplexion, used to say that he looked like a fly in milk, in this dress\r\nof white and silver. I continued to frequent the society of the\r\nTchoglokoffs as before, although it was now dreadfully wearisome. The\r\nhusband and wife were full of regrets for the absence of the chief\r\nattractions of their society, in which most assuredly I did not\r\ncontradict them. The illness of Soltikoff prolonged his absence, and\r\nduring it the Empress sent us orders to come from Oranienbaum and join\r\nher at Cronstadt, whither she was about to proceed, in order to admit\r\nthe waters into the canal of Peter I. That Emperor had commenced the\r\nwork, and just then it was completed. She arrived at Cronstadt before\r\nus. The night following was very stormy, and, as immediately on her\r\narrival, she had sent us orders to join her, she supposed we must have\r\nbeen caught in the storm, and was in great anxiety all night. She\r\nfancied that a ship, which could be seen from her window, labouring in\r\nthe sea, might be the yacht in which we were to make the voyage. She had\r\nrecourse to the relics which she always kept by her bedside; carried\r\nthem to the window, and kept moving them in a direction opposite to the\r\nship which was tossing in the storm. She exclaimed repeatedly that we\r\nshould certainly be lost, and that it would be all her fault, because a\r\nshort time previously she had sent us a reprimand for not showing her\r\nmore prompt obedience, and she now supposed we must have set out\r\nimmediately on the arrival of the yacht. But, in fact, the yacht did not\r\nreach Oranienbaum until after the storm, so that we did not go on board\r\nuntil the afternoon of the next day. We remained three days at\r\nCronstadt, during which the blessing of the canal took place with very\r\ngreat solemnity, and the waters were, for the first time, let into it.\r\nAfter dinner there was a grand ball. The Empress wished to remain at\r\nCronstadt to see the waters let out again, but she left on the third day\r\nwithout this having been effected. The canal was never dried from that\r\ntime, until, in my reign, I caused the steam-mill to be constructed\r\nwhich empties it. Otherwise, the thing would have been impossible, the\r\nbottom of the canal being lower than the sea; but this was not perceived\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\nFrom Cronstadt every one returned to his own quarters; the Empress went\r\nto Peterhoff, and we to Oranienbaum. M. Tchoglokoff asked and obtained\r\nleave to go for a month to one of his estates. During his absence Madame\r\nTchoglokoff gave herself a great deal of trouble to execute the Empress'\r\norders to the letter. At first she had many conferences with Bressan,\r\nthe Grand Duke's valet de chambre. Bressan found at Oranienbaum a pretty\r\nwoman named Madame Groot, the widow of a painter. It took several days\r\nto persuade her, to promise her I know not what, and then to instruct\r\nher in what they wanted of her, and to what she was to lend herself. At\r\nlast Bressan was charged with the duty of making this young and pretty\r\nwidow known to the Grand Duke. I clearly saw that Madame Tchoglokoff was\r\ndeep in some intrigue, but I knew not what. At last, Serge Soltikoff\r\nreturned from his voluntary exile, and told me pretty nearly how matters\r\nstood. Finally, after much trouble, Madame Tchoglokoff gained her end,\r\nand when she felt sure of this she informed the Empress that everything\r\nwas going on as she wished. She expected a great reward for her trouble;\r\nbut in this she was much mistaken, for nothing was given her; however,\r\nshe maintained that the Empire was in her debt. Immediately after this\r\nwe returned to the city.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I persuaded the Grand Duke to break off the\r\nnegotiations with Denmark. I reminded him of the advice of the Count de\r\nBernis, who had already departed for Vienna. He listened to me, and\r\nordered the negotiations to be closed without anything being concluded:\r\nand this was done. After a short stay at the Summer Palace, we returned\r\nto the Winter Palace.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that Serge Soltikoff was beginning to be relax in his\r\nattentions; that he became absent, sometimes absurd, arrogant, and\r\ndissipated. I was vexed at this, and spoke to him on the subject. He\r\ngave me but poor excuses, and pretended that I did not understand the\r\nextreme cleverness of his conduct. He was right, for I did think it\r\nstrange enough. We were told to get ready for the journey to Moscow,\r\nwhich we did. We left St. Petersburg on the 14th of December, 1752.\r\nSoltikoff remained behind, and did not follow us for several weeks\r\nafter. I left the city with some slight indications of pregnancy. We\r\ntravelled very rapidly day and night. At the last stage before reaching\r\nMoscow, these signs disappeared with violent spasms. On our arrival, and\r\nseeing the turn things were taking, I felt satisfied that I had had a\r\nmiscarriage. Madame Tchoglokoff also remained behind at St. Petersburg,\r\nas she had just been delivered of her last child, which was a girl. This\r\nwas the seventh. On her recovery she joined us at Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1753.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we lodged in a wing built of wood, constructed only this autumn,\r\nand in such a way that the water ran down the wainscoting, and all the\r\napartments were exceedingly damp. This wing consisted of two ranges of\r\napartments, each having five or six large rooms, of which those looking\r\nto the street were for me, and those on the other side for the Grand\r\nDuke. In the one intended for my toilet, my maids and ladies of the\r\nbedchamber were lodged, together with their servants; so that there were\r\nseventeen girls and women lodged in one room, which had, it is true,\r\nthree large windows, but no other outlet than my bed-room, through\r\nwhich, for every kind of purpose, they were obliged to pass, a thing\r\nneither pleasant for them nor for me. We were obliged to put up with\r\nthis inconvenience, of which I have never seen the like. Besides, the\r\nroom in which they took their meals was one of my ante-chambers. I was\r\nill when I arrived. To remedy this inconvenience, I had some very large\r\nscreens placed in my bed-room, by means of which I divided it into\r\nthree; but this was scarcely of any use, for the doors were opening and\r\nshutting continually, as was unavoidable. At last, on the tenth day, the\r\nEmpress came to see me, and observing the continual passing to and fro,\r\nshe went into the other chamber, and said to my women, \"I will have a\r\ndifferent outlet made for you than through the sleeping-room of the\r\nGrand Duchess.\" But what did she do? She ordered a partition to be made,\r\nwhich took away one of the windows of a room in which, even before this,\r\nseventeen persons could hardly exist. Here, then, was the chamber made\r\nsmaller in order to gain a passage; the window was opened towards the\r\nstreet, a flight of steps was led up to it, and thus my women were\r\nobliged to pass and repass along the street. Under their window,\r\nnecessaries were placed for them; in going to dinner, they must again\r\npass along the street. In a word, this arrangement was worthless, and I\r\ncannot tell how it was that these seventeen women, thus huddled up and\r\ncrowded together, did not catch a putrid fever; and all this, too, close\r\nto my bed-room, which, in consequence, was so filled with vermin of\r\nevery kind that I could not sleep. At last, Madame Tchoglokoff, having\r\nrecovered after her accouchement, arrived at Moscow, as did, some days\r\nlater, Serge Soltikoff. As Moscow is very large, and people much\r\ndispersed in it, he availed himself of this locality, so favourable to\r\nthe purpose, to conceal the decrease of his attentions, feigned or real,\r\nat court. To tell the truth, I was grieved at this; however, he gave me\r\nsuch good and specious reasons for it, that as soon as I had seen him\r\nand spoken to him, my annoyance on the subject vanished. We agreed that,\r\nin order to decrease the number of his enemies, I should get some remark\r\nrepeated to Count Bestoujeff which might lead him to hope that I was\r\nless averse to him than in former days. With this message I charged a\r\nperson called Bremse, who was employed in the Holstein Chancery of M.\r\nPechline. This person, when not at court, frequently went to the\r\nresidence of the Chancellor Count Bestoujeff. He eagerly accepted the\r\ncommission, and brought me back word that the Chancellor was delighted,\r\nand said that I might command him as often as I thought proper, and that\r\nif, on his part, he could be of any use to me, he begged me to point out\r\nto him some safe channel by which we might communicate with each other.\r\nI perceived his drift, and I told Bremse that I would think of it. I\r\nrepeated this to Soltikoff, and it was immediately settled that he\r\nshould go to the Chancellor on the plea of a visit, as he had but just\r\narrived. The old man gave him a most cordial reception; took him aside,\r\nspoke to him of the internal condition of our court, of the stupidity of\r\nthe Tchoglokoffs, saying, among other things, \"I know, although you are\r\ntheir intimate friends, that you understand them as well as I do, for\r\nyou are a young man of sense.\" Then he spoke of me, and of my situation,\r\njust as if he had lived in my room; adding, \"In gratitude for the\r\ngood-will which the Grand Duchess has so kindly evinced for me, I am\r\ngoing to do her a little service, for which she will, I think, thank me.\r\nI will make Madame Vladislava as gentle as a lamb for her, so that she\r\nwill be able to do with her whatever she pleases; she will see that I am\r\nnot such an ogre as I have been represented to her.\" Finally, Serge\r\nSoltikoff returned, enchanted with his commission and his man. He gave\r\nhim some advice for himself, also, as wise as it was useful. All this\r\nmade him very intimate with us, without any one having the least\r\nsuspicion of the fact.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Madame Tchoglokoff, who never lost sight of her\r\nfavourite project of watching over the succession, took me aside one day\r\nand said, \"Listen to me, I must speak to you with all sincerity.\" I\r\nopened my eyes and ears, and not without cause. She began with a long\r\npreamble, after her fashion, respecting her attachment to her husband,\r\nher own prudent conduct, what was necessary and what was not necessary\r\nfor ensuring mutual love and facilitating conjugal ties; and then she\r\nwent on to say, that occasionally there were situations in which a\r\nhigher interest demanded an exception to the rule. I let her talk on\r\nwithout interruption, not knowing what she was driving at, a good deal\r\nastonished, and uncertain whether it was not a snare she was laying for\r\nme, or whether she was speaking with sincerity. Just as I was making\r\nthese reflections in my own mind, she said to me, \"You shall presently\r\nsee whether I love my country, and whether I am sincere; I do not doubt\r\nbut you have cast an eye of preference upon some one or other; I leave\r\nyou to choose between Sergius Soltikoff and Leon Narichkine--if I do not\r\nmistake, it is the latter.\" Here I exclaimed, \"No no! not at all.\"\r\n\"Well, then,\" she said, \"if it be not Narichkine, it is Soltikoff.\" To\r\nthat I made no reply, and she went on saying, \"You shall see that it\r\nwill not be I who will throw difficulties in your way.\" I played the\r\nsimpleton to such a degree, that she scolded me for it several times,\r\nboth in town and in the country, whither we went after Easter.\r\n\r\nIt was at that time, or thereabout, that the Empress gave to the Grand\r\nDuke the lands of Liberitza, and several others, at a distance of\r\nfourteen or fifteen verstes from Moscow. But before we went to reside on\r\nthese new possessions of his Imperial Highness, the Empress celebrated\r\nthe anniversary of her coronation at Moscow. This was the 25th of April.\r\nIt was announced to us that she had ordered the ceremony to be observed\r\nexactly as it had been on the very day of her coronation. We were\r\ncurious to know how this would be. The evening before, she went to sleep\r\nat the Kremlin. We stayed at the Sloboda, in the wooden palace, and\r\nreceived orders to go to mass at the cathedral. At nine o'clock in the\r\nmorning we started from the wooden palace in the state carriage, our\r\nservants walking on foot. We traversed the whole of Moscow, step by\r\nstep--the distance through the city being as much as seven verstes--and\r\nwe alighted at the cathedral. A few moments after the Empress arrived\r\nwith her retinue, wearing the small crown on her head, and the imperial\r\nmantle, borne as usual by her chamberlains. She went to her ordinary\r\nseat in the church, and in all this there was, as yet, nothing\r\nunusual--nothing that was not practised at all the other fêtes of her\r\nreign. The church was damp and cold to a degree that I had never before\r\nfelt. I was quite blue, and frozen in my court-dress and with bare neck.\r\nThe Empress sent me word to put on a sable tippet, but I had not one\r\nwith me. She ordered her own to be brought, took one, and put it on her\r\nneck. I saw another in the box, and thought she was going to send it to\r\nme, but I was mistaken--she sent it back. This I thought a pretty\r\nevident sign of displeasure. Madame Tchoglokoff, who saw that I was\r\nshivering, procured me, from some one, a silk kerchief, which I put\r\nround my neck. When mass and the sermon were over, the Empress left the\r\nchurch, and we were preparing to follow her, when she sent us word that\r\nwe might return home. It was then we learned that she was going to dine\r\nalone on the throne, and that in this respect the ceremonial would be\r\nobserved just as it was on the day of her coronation, when she had dined\r\nalone. Excluded from this dinner, we returned, as we had come, in great\r\nstate, our people on foot, making a journey of fourteen verstes, going\r\nand returning, through the city of Moscow, and we benumbed with cold and\r\ndying of hunger. If the Empress seemed to us in a very bad temper during\r\nmass, this disagreeable evidence of want of attention, to say no more,\r\ndid not leave us in the best of humours either. At the other great\r\nfestivals, when she dined on the throne, we had the honour of dining\r\nwith her; this time she repelled us publicly. Returning alone in the\r\ncarriage with the Grand Duke, I told him what I thought of this, and he\r\nsaid that he would complain of it. On reaching home, half dead with cold\r\nand fatigue, I complained to Madame Tchoglokoff of having caught cold.\r\nThe next day there was a ball at the wooden palace; I said I was ill,\r\nand did not go. The Grand Duke really did make some complaint or other\r\nto the Schouvaloffs on the subject, and they sent him some answer, which\r\nappeared satisfactory to him, and nothing more was said about the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAbout this time we learned that Zachar Czernicheff and Colonel Nicholas\r\nLeontieff had had a quarrel, while at play, in the house of Roman\r\nVoronzoff; that they had fought with swords, and that Zachar Czernicheff\r\nhad received a severe wound in the head. It was so serious that he could\r\nnot be removed from Count Voronzoff's house to his own. He remained\r\nthere, was very ill, and there was some talk of trepanning him. I was\r\nvery sorry for him, for I liked him very much. Leontieff was arrested\r\nby order of the Empress. This combat set the whole city in a ferment, on\r\naccount of the extensive connections of both the champions. Leontieff\r\nwas the son-in-law of the Countess Roumianzoff, a very near relative of\r\nthe Panines and Kourakines. The other, also, had relatives, friends, and\r\nprotectors. The occurrence had taken place at the house of Count Roman\r\nVoronzoff; the wounded man was still there. At last, when the danger was\r\nover, the affair was hushed up, and matters went no farther.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the month of May, I again had indications of pregnancy.\r\nWe went to Liberitza, an estate of the Grand Duke, twelve or fourteen\r\nverstes from Moscow. The stone house which was on it, had been built a\r\nlong time ago by Prince Menchikoff, and was now falling to decay, so\r\nthat we could not live in it. As a substitute, tents were set up in the\r\ncourt, and every morning, at two or three o'clock, my sleep was broken\r\nby the sound of the axe, and the noises made in building a wooden wing,\r\nwhich was being hurriedly erected, within two paces, so to speak, of our\r\ntents, in order that we might have a place to live in during the\r\nremainder of the summer. The rest of our time we spent in hunting,\r\nwalking, or riding. I no longer went on horseback, but in a cabriolet.\r\nAbout the Feast of St. Peter we returned to Moscow. I was seized with\r\nsuch drowsiness that I slept every day till noon, and then it was only\r\nwith difficulty that I was awakened in time for dinner. The Feast of St.\r\nPeter was kept in the usual way: I was present at Mass, at the dinner,\r\nthe ball, and the supper. Next morning I felt great pains in my loins.\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff summoned a midwife, who predicted the miscarriage,\r\nwhich actually occurred the following night. I might have been with\r\nchild two or three months. For thirteen days I was in great danger, as\r\nit was suspected that a portion of the after-birth had remained behind.\r\nThis circumstance was kept a secret from me. At last, on the thirteenth\r\nday, it came away of itself--without pain, or even a struggle. In\r\nconsequence of this accident I had to keep my room for six weeks, during\r\nwhich the heat was insupportable. The Empress came to see me the day I\r\nfell ill, and appeared to be affected by my state. During the six weeks\r\nthat I kept my room I was nearly tired to death. The only society I had\r\nwas Madame Tchoglokoff, who came but rarely, and a little Kalmuck girl,\r\nwhom I liked for her pretty, agreeable ways. I frequently cried from\r\nennui. As for the Grand Duke, he was mostly in his own room, where one\r\nof his valets, a Ukrainian, named Karnovitch, a fool as well as a\r\ndrunkard, did his best to amuse him; furnishing him with toys, with\r\nwine, and such other strong liquors as he could procure, without the\r\nknowledge of M. Tchoglokoff, who, in fact, was deceived and made a fool\r\nof by every one. But in these nocturnal and secret orgies with the\r\nservants of the chamber, among whom were several young Kalmucks, the\r\nGrand Duke often found himself ill-obeyed and ill-served; for, being\r\ndrunk, they knew not what they did, and forgot that they were with their\r\nmaster, and that that master was the Grand Duke. Then his Imperial\r\nHighness would have recourse to blows with his stick, or the blade of\r\nhis sword; but in spite of all this, he was ill-obeyed; and more than\r\nonce he had recourse to me, complaining of his people, and begging me to\r\nmake them listen to reason. On these occasions I used to go to his\r\nrooms, give them a good scolding, and remind them of their duties, when\r\nthey would instantly resume their proper places. This made the Grand\r\nDuke often say to me, and also to Bressan, that he could not conceive\r\nhow I managed those people; for, as for himself, though he belaboured\r\nthem soundly, yet he could not make them obedient, while I, with a\r\nsingle word, could get them to do whatever I wished. One day when I went\r\nfor this purpose into the apartments of his Imperial Highness, I beheld\r\na great rat, which he had had hung--with all the paraphernalia of an\r\nexecution--in the middle of a cabinet, formed by means of a partition. I\r\nasked him what all this meant. He told me that this rat had committed a\r\ncrime; one which, according to the laws of war, was deserving of capital\r\npunishment; it had climbed over the ramparts of a fortress of cardboard\r\nwhich he had on the table in his cabinet, and had eaten two sentinels,\r\nmade of pith, who were on duty at the bastions. He had had the criminal\r\ntried by martial law, his setter having caught him, and he was\r\nimmediately hung, as I saw, and was to remain there exposed to the\r\npublic gaze for three days, as an example. I could not help bursting\r\ninto a loud laugh at the extreme folly of the thing; but this greatly\r\ndispleased him. Seeing the importance he attached to the matter, I\r\nretired, excusing myself on account of my ignorance, as a woman, of\r\nmilitary law; but this did not prevent his being very much out of humour\r\nwith me on account of my laughter. In justification of the rat, however,\r\nit may at least be said, that he was hung without having been questioned\r\nor heard in his own defence.\r\n\r\nDuring this stay of the court at Moscow, it happened that one of the\r\ncourt footmen became insane, and violently so. The Empress gave orders\r\nthat her chief physician, Boërhave, should take charge of him. He was\r\nplaced in a chamber close to that of Boërhave, who resided at court.\r\nBesides this case, it also happened that several other persons went out\r\nof their mind this year. In proportion as these cases came under the\r\nnotice of the Empress, she had the persons brought to court and lodged\r\nnear Boërhave, so that they formed a sort of mad-house at court. I\r\nremember that the principal persons among them was Tchedajeff, a major\r\nof the Semenofsky guards; a Lieutenant-Colonel Lintrum; a Major\r\nTchoglokoff; a monk of the convent of Voskresensky, who emasculated\r\nhimself with a razor, and several others. The madness of Tchedajeff\r\nconsisted in his believing Nadir-Schah, otherwise Thamas-Kuli-Khan, the\r\nusurper and tyrant of Persia, to be God. When the physicians could not\r\nsucceed in curing him of his delusion, they placed him in the hands of\r\nthe priests. These persuaded the Empress to have him exorcised. She\r\nherself assisted at the ceremony; but Tchedajeff remained, to all\r\nappearance, as mad as before. There were, however, people who had doubts\r\nof his lunacy, as he was quite reasonable on every other point, but that\r\nof Nadir-Schah; his friends even consulted him about their affairs, and\r\nhe gave them very sensible advice. Those who did not believe him mad,\r\ngave as a reason for his affectation of madness his having had some\r\ntrouble on his hands, from which he extricated himself by this ruse. At\r\nthe beginning of the Empress' reign he had been supervisor of taxes, had\r\nbeen accused of extortion, and was threatened with a trial, in dread of\r\nwhich he took up this fancy, which extricated him from the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of August, 1753, we returned to the country. To keep the\r\n5th of September, the Feast of the Empress, she went to the convent of\r\nVoskresensky. Whilst there, the church was struck with lightning;\r\nfortunately her Imperial Majesty was in a chapel at the side of the\r\ngreat church, and only learnt the fact through the terror of the\r\ncourtiers; however, there was no one either hurt or killed by the\r\naccident. A little while afterwards she returned to Moscow, whither we\r\nalso repaired from Liberitza. Upon our return to the city, we saw the\r\nPrincess of Courland kiss the Empress' hand in public for the permission\r\nwhich had been given her to marry Prince George Hovansky. She had\r\nquarrelled with the object of her first engagement, Peter Soltikoff, who\r\nimmediately afterwards married a Princess Sonzoff. On the 1st of\r\nNovember of this year, at three o'clock in the afternoon, I was in\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff's room, when her husband, Serge Soltikoff, Leon\r\nNarichkine, and several other gentlemen of the court, left us to go to\r\nthe apartments of the Chamberlain Schouvaloff, to congratulate him on\r\nhis birthday, which fell on that day. Madame Tchoglokoff, the Princess\r\nGagarine, and I were talking together, when, after hearing some noise in\r\na little chapel close by, a couple of these gentlemen ran in, telling us\r\nthat they had been prevented from passing through the halls of the\r\nchateau, as it was on fire. I immediately went to my room, and, as I\r\npassed through an ante-chamber, I saw that the balustrade at the corner\r\nof the great hall was on fire. It was about twenty paces from our wing.\r\nOn entering my apartments, I found them already filled with soldiers and\r\nservants, who were removing the furniture, and carrying off everything\r\nthey could. Madame Tchoglokoff followed me, and as there was nothing\r\nmore to be done but wait till it caught fire, we left. At the gate we\r\nfound the carriage of the chapel-master, Araga, who had come to attend a\r\nconcert given by the Grand Duke, whom I had already informed of the\r\naccident. We entered the carriage: the streets were covered with mud, in\r\nconsequence of the previous heavy rains. Here we had a view of the fire\r\nand of the way in which the people were carrying out the furniture from\r\nevery part of the house. I here saw a strange sight, viz: the\r\nastonishing number of rats and mice which were descending the staircase\r\nin file without over-much hurrying themselves. The want of engines\r\nrendered it impossible to save this immense wooden structure, and,\r\nbesides, the few that were there were kept under the very staircase\r\nwhich was on fire; this, too, occupied very nearly the centre of the\r\nsurrounding buildings, which covered a space of some two or three\r\nverstes in circumference. The heat became so great that we could not\r\nbear it, so that we were obliged to have the carriage driven some few\r\nhundred paces outwards. At last M. Tchoglokoff and the Grand Duke came\r\nand told us that the Empress was going to Pokrovsky House, and had given\r\norders that we should go to M. Tchoglokoff's, which formed the right\r\nhand corner of the main street of the Sloboda. We at once repaired\r\nthither. The house had a hall in the centre and four chambers on each\r\nside. It was hardly possible to be more uncomfortable than we were here;\r\nthe wind blew in every direction, the windows and doors were all half\r\nrotten, and the planks of the floor open to the breadth of three or four\r\ninches; besides this, there was vermin everywhere. Here resided the\r\nchildren and servants of M. Tchoglokoff. As we entered they were sent\r\nout, and we were lodged in this horrible house, which was almost bare of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nOn the day after we took up our abode here, I saw what a Kalmuck's nose\r\ncould hold. The little girl whom I kept near me, on my waking, pointed\r\nto her nose, and said, \"I have a nut here.\" I felt her nose, but could\r\nnot find anything. All the morning, however, she kept repeating, over\r\nand over again, that she had a nut in her nose. She was a child of from\r\nfour to five years old. No one could tell what she meant by a nut in\r\nher nose. But about noon, as she was running along, she fell down, and\r\nstruck against the table. This made her cry; while crying, she took out\r\nher pocket-handkerchief and wiped her nose, and in doing so the nut fell\r\nfrom it. I saw this myself, and could then understand how a nut, which\r\ncould not be held in any European nose without being perceived, might be\r\nheld in the hollow of a Kalmuck nose, which is placed within the head\r\nbetween two immense cheeks.\r\n\r\nOur clothes, and everything else, had been left in the mud in front of\r\nthe burning palace, and were brought to us during the night and\r\nfollowing day. What I most regretted was my books. I was at this time\r\njust finishing the fourth volume of Bayle's Dictionary: I had spent two\r\nyears in reading it, and got through a volume every six months. From\r\nthis one may judge of the solitude in which my life was passed. At last\r\nmy books were brought to me. My clothes were found, those of the\r\nCountess Schouvaloff, etc. Madame Vladislava showed me, as a curiosity,\r\nthis lady's petticoats. They were lined behind with leather, as she was\r\nunable to retain her water--an infirmity which had afflicted her ever\r\nsince her first accouchement. All her petticoats were impregnated with\r\nthe smell, and I sent them back in all haste to the owner. In this fire\r\nthe Empress lost all that had been brought to Moscow of her immense\r\nwardrobe. She did me the honour of telling me that she had lost 4,000\r\ndresses, and that of all these the only one that she regretted was the\r\none made from the piece of stuff which I had received from my mother.\r\nShe also lost, on this occasion, several other valuables; amongst them a\r\nbowl covered with engraved stones, which Count Roumianzoff had purchased\r\nat Constantinople, and for which he had paid 8,000 ducats. All those\r\neffects had been placed in a wardrobe over the hall which had caught\r\nfire. This hall served as a vestibule to the grand hall of the palace.\r\nAt ten o'clock in the morning, the men whose duty it was to light the\r\nstoves had come to heat this entrance-hall. After putting the wood into\r\nthe stove, they lighted it as usual. This done, the room became filled\r\nwith smoke; they thought that it escaped by some imperceptible holes in\r\nthe stove, and set to work to cover with clay the interstices of the\r\ntiles. The smoke increasing, they tried to find some chinks in the\r\nstove, but not finding any, they perceived that the outlet must be\r\nbetween the partitions of the apartment. These partitions were only of\r\nwood. They got water, and put out the fire in the stove, but the smoke\r\nstill increased, and made its way into the ante-chamber, where there was\r\na sentinel of the horse-guards. The latter, expecting to be suffocated,\r\nand not daring to move from his post, broke a pane of glass, and began\r\nto cry out; but no one coming to his assistance, nor hearing him, he\r\nfired his musket through the window. The report was heard by the main\r\nguard, which was posted opposite the palace. They ran to him, and on\r\ncoming in, found the place filled with a dense smoke, out of which they\r\nwithdrew the sentinel. The stove heaters were put under arrest. They had\r\nhoped to extinguish the fire, or at least prevent the smoke from\r\nincreasing without being obliged to give any alarm; and they had been\r\nhard at work with this view for five hours.\r\n\r\nThis fire gave rise to a discovery on the part of M. Tchoglokoff. The\r\nGrand Duke had in his apartments several very large chests of drawers.\r\nAs they were being carried out, some of the drawers, being either open\r\nor badly fastened, disclosed to the spectators what they were filled\r\nwith. Who would have thought it? The drawers contained nothing but a\r\ngreat quantity of bottles of wine and strong liquors. They served his\r\nImperial Highness for a cellar. Tchoglokoff spoke to me on the matter,\r\nand I told him I was quite ignorant of the circumstance, which was the\r\ntruth; I knew nothing of it, but I was a frequent, indeed, almost a\r\ndaily witness of the Grand Duke's drunkenness.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire we remained in Tchoglokoff's house for nearly six weeks.\r\nWhile residing here, we often had to pass in front of a house, situated\r\nin a garden near the Soltikoff Bridge. It belonged to the Empress, and\r\nwas called the Bishop's House, because she had bought it of a bishop.\r\nThe idea occurred to us of asking her Majesty, unknown to the\r\nTchoglokoffs, to allow us to occupy it, for it appeared to us, and we\r\nwere also told that it was, more habitable than the one we were in. We\r\nreceived orders to go and take up our abode in the Bishop's House. It\r\nwas a very old wooden house, from which there was no view, but it was\r\nbuilt on stone vaults, and by this means was higher than the one we had\r\njust quitted, which had only a ground floor. The stoves were so old,\r\nthat when lighted, one could see the fire through the furnace, so\r\nnumerous were the chinks and cracks, while the rooms were filled with\r\nsmoke. We all had headaches and sore eyes. In fact, we ran the risk of\r\nbeing burnt alive in this house. There was only one wooden staircase,\r\nand the windows were very high. The place actually did catch fire two or\r\nthree times while we were there, but we succeeded in extinguishing the\r\nflames. I caught there a bad sore throat, with a great deal of fever.\r\nThe day I fell ill, M. de Breithardt, who had returned to Russia on the\r\npart of the Austrian court, was to sup with us, previously to taking\r\nleave. He found me with red and swollen eyes, and thought I had been\r\ncrying: nor was he mistaken: ennui, indisposition, and the physical and\r\nmoral discomforts of my position had given me much hypochondria. During\r\nthe whole day, which I passed with Madame Tchoglokoff, waiting for those\r\nwho never came, she kept saying every moment, \"See how they desert us.\"\r\nHer husband had dined out, and taken everybody with him. In spite of all\r\nthe promises which Serge Soltikoff had made us to steal away from this\r\ndinner party, he only returned with M. Tchoglokoff. All this put me in a\r\nvery bad humour. At last, some days afterwards, we were allowed to go to\r\nLiberitza. Here we thought ourselves in paradise; the house was quite\r\nnew, and tolerably well fitted up. We danced every evening, and all our\r\ncourt was collected there. At one of these balls we saw the Grand Duke\r\noccupied a long while in whispering to M. Tchoglokoff, who,\r\nsubsequently, appeared vexed, absent, and more close and scowling than\r\nusual. Serge Soltikoff seeing this, and finding that Tchoglokoff treated\r\nhim with great coolness, went and sat down by the side of Mademoiselle\r\nMartha Schafiroff, and tried to discover what could be the meaning of\r\nthis unusual intimacy between the Grand Duke and M. Tchoglokoff. She\r\ntold him that she did not know, but that the Grand Duke had on several\r\noccasions said to her, \"Serge Soltikoff and my wife deceive Tchoglokoff\r\nin the most unheard-of way. He is in love with the Grand Duchess; but\r\nshe cannot endure him: Soltikoff is the confidant of Tchoglokoff, and\r\nmakes him believe that he is working for him with my wife, while instead\r\nof that he is working for himself with her. She can very well endure\r\nSoltikoff, for he is amusing: she makes use of him to manage Tchoglokoff\r\njust as she pleases, and, in reality, she laughs at them both. I must\r\nundeceive that poor devil Tchoglokoff, who excites my pity. I must tell\r\nhim the truth, and then he will see who is his true friend--my wife or\r\nI.\" As soon as Soltikoff became aware of this dangerous dialogue, and of\r\nhis delicate position in consequence, he repeated it to me, and then\r\nwent and seated himself by the side of Tchoglokoff, and asked him what\r\nwas the matter with him. The latter at first was unwilling to enter into\r\nany explanation, and merely sighed; then he began uttering jeremiads on\r\nthe difficulty of finding faithful friends. At last Soltikoff turned and\r\ntwisted him in so many different directions, that he drew from him an\r\navowal of the conversation which he had just had with the Grand Duke. No\r\none certainly could have formed any idea of what had passed between\r\nthem, without being told of it. The Grand Duke began by making great\r\nprotestations of friendship to Tchoglokoff, saying that it was only in\r\nthe most important circumstances of life that it was possible to\r\ndistinguish true friends from false; that to show the sincerity of his\r\nown friendship, he was going to give him a very emphatic proof of his\r\nfrankness; that he knew, beyond doubt, that he was in love with me; that\r\nhe did not impute it to him as a crime that I should appear agreeable to\r\nhim, for that no one was master of his own heart; but that,\r\nnevertheless, he ought to apprise him that he had made a bad choice of\r\nconfidants, and in his simplicity believed Serge Soltikoff to be his\r\nfriend, and working in his interest with me, whereas he was only working\r\nfor himself, and he suspected he was his rival; that, as for me, I\r\nlaughed at them both, but if M. Tchoglokoff would follow his advice and\r\ntrust in him then he would see that he was his only and true friend. M.\r\nTchoglokoff gave the Grand Duke many thanks for his friendship, and his\r\nproffers of friendship; but in reality he considered all the rest as\r\nmere chimeras and delusions on his part.\r\n\r\nIt may easily be believed that, in any case, he did not much wish for a\r\nconfidant who, both by his rank and character, was as little to be\r\ntrusted as he was able to be useful. This matter being once stated,\r\nSoltikoff had but little trouble in restoring tranquillity to\r\nTchoglokoff's mind, for he was not in the habit of attaching much\r\nimportance nor paying much attention to the discourses of a person so\r\ndevoid of judgment, and so generally known to be so. When I learnt all\r\nthis, I must confess I was extremely indignant with the Grand Duke, and,\r\nto prevent his returning to the subject, I told him that I was not\r\nignorant of what had passed between him and Tchoglokoff. He blushed,\r\nsaid nothing, went off, sulked, and so the matter ended.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Moscow, we left the Bishop's House for apartments in\r\nwhat was called the Empress' Summer House, which had not been burnt. The\r\nEmpress had had new apartments constructed in the space of six weeks.\r\nFor this purpose beams had been transported from Perova House, from\r\nCount Hendrikoff's, and from the dwelling of the Princes of Georgia. At\r\nlast she took possession of these rooms about the beginning of the new\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1754.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Empress kept the new-year's day of 1754 in this palace, and the\r\nGrand Duke and I had the honour of dining with her in public on the\r\nthrone. At table, her majesty seemed very lively and talkative. Around\r\nthe throne, tables were laid for several hundred persons of the highest\r\nrank. At dinner the Empress asked who was that thin and ugly woman, with\r\na crane's neck, whom she saw seated there (pointing to the place); she\r\nwas told it was Mademoiselle Martha Schafiroff. She burst into a laugh,\r\nand, turning to me, remarked that this reminded her of a Russian\r\nproverb, which said, \"A long neck is only good for hanging.\" I could not\r\nbut smile at the point of this imperial sarcasm, which did not fall\r\nunheeded, for the courtiers passed it on from mouth to mouth, so that on\r\nrising from table, I found several persons who already knew of it.\r\nWhether the Grand Duke heard it, I know not, but at all events he did\r\nnot allude to it, and I took care not to mention it to him.\r\n\r\nNever was a year more fertile in fires than that of 1753-54. I have\r\nseveral times seen, from the windows of my apartments in the Summer\r\nPalace, two, three, four, and even five fires at once in different parts\r\nof Moscow. During the Carnival, the Empress gave orders for several\r\nballs and masquerades to be given in her apartments, at one of which I\r\nsaw her engaged in a long conversation with the wife of General\r\nMatiouchkine. This lady was unwilling that her son should marry the\r\nPrincess Gagarine. But the Empress persuaded her, and the Princess\r\nGagarine, who numbered a good thirty years, had permission to marry M.\r\nDmitri Matiouchkine. She was much pleased at this, and so was I. It was\r\na marriage of inclination. Matiouchkine was at this time very handsome.\r\nMadame Tchoglokoff did not come with us to our summer apartments. Under\r\ndifferent pretexts she remained, with her children, in her own house,\r\nwhich was very near the court. But the truth is, that, virtuous and\r\nloving wife as she was, she had conceived a passion for Prince Peter\r\nRepnine, and a marked aversion for her husband. She thought she could\r\nnot be happy without a confidant, and I appeared to her the most\r\ntrustworthy person. She showed me all the letters she received from her\r\nlover. I kept her secret faithfully, with scrupulous exactitude and\r\nprudence. Her interviews with the Prince were very secret; yet in spite\r\nof this the husband had some suspicions. An officer of the horse-guards\r\nnamed Kaminine, had given rise to them. This man was jealousy and\r\nsuspicion personified: it was his nature. He was an old friend of\r\nTchoglokoff. The latter opened his mind to Serge Soltikoff, who\r\nendeavoured to tranquillize him. I was careful not to tell Soltikoff\r\nanything I knew, for fear of some involuntary indiscretion on his part.\r\nAt last the husband also sounded me a little. I pretended ignorance and\r\nastonishment, and held my tongue.\r\n\r\nIn the month of February I had some signs of pregnancy. On Easter\r\nSunday, during mass, Tchoglokoff fell ill of the dry cholic; they gave\r\nhim various remedies, but his disease only grew worse. During Easter\r\nweek, the Grand Duke, with the gentlemen of our court, went out riding.\r\nSerge Soltikoff was of the number. I remained at home, for they were\r\nafraid to let me go out in my present condition, especially as I had\r\ntwice miscarried. I was alone in my room when M. Tchoglokoff sent me a\r\nrequest to come to him. I went, and found him in bed. He made a thousand\r\ncomplaints of his wife; told me she saw Prince Repnine; that he went to\r\nher house on foot; that, during the Carnival, he had gone there, one\r\ncourtball day, dressed as a harlequin; that Kaminine had had him\r\nfollowed; in short, God only knows all the details he gave me.\r\n\r\nJust as he was most excited, his wife arrived; whereupon he began, in my\r\npresence, to load her with reproaches, telling her that she deserted him\r\nin his sickness. They were both very suspicious and narrow-minded. I was\r\nnearly frightened to death lest his wife should suspect that it was I\r\nwho had betrayed her, from the mass of details which he then went into\r\nrelative to her interviews. His wife, on the other hand, told him that\r\nit was not strange if she punished him for his conduct towards her; that\r\nneither he, nor any one else, could reproach her with having ever until\r\nnow failed in her duty towards him in any respect; and she ended with\r\nsaying that it ill became him to complain. Both appealed continually to\r\nme as a witness of what they said. I held my tongue, fearing to offend\r\nthe one or the other, or compromise myself: my face was burning from\r\napprehension. I was alone with them. When the quarrel was at its\r\nhighest, Madame Vladislava came in to tell me that the Empress had just\r\nentered my room. I ran back immediately. Madame Tchoglokoff left at the\r\nsame time, but, instead of following me, she stopped in a corridor,\r\nwhere there was a staircase leading into the garden, and there, as I was\r\nafterwards told, she sat down. As for myself, I reached my room quite\r\nout of breath, and found the Empress there. As she saw that I was out of\r\nbreath and rather red, she asked where I had been. I told her that I was\r\njust come from the apartments of M. Tchoglokoff, who was ill, and that I\r\nhad run in order to get back as quickly as possible, having been\r\ninformed that she had condescended to come to my rooms. She did not ask\r\nme any more questions, but seemed to me to be dwelling upon what I had\r\nsaid, as if it appeared strange to her. Nevertheless, she continued\r\nspeaking to me. She did not ask where the Grand Duke was, for she knew\r\nhe had gone out. Neither he nor I, during the whole of her reign, dared\r\nto go out in the city or leave the house, without first sending to ask\r\nher permission. Madame Vladislava was in the room: the Empress addressed\r\nher several times, then spoke to me, and always of indifferent matters:\r\nfinally, after a visit of nearly half an hour, she went away, saying\r\nthat, in consequence of my pregnancy, she would dispense with my\r\nappearing on the 21st and 25th of April. I was surprised that Madame\r\nTchoglokoff had not followed. When the Empress had gone, I asked Madame\r\nVladislava what had become of her. She informed me that she had sat down\r\non the stairs, and burst into tears. Upon the return of the Grand Duke,\r\nI recounted to Serge Soltikoff what had occurred during their absence;\r\nhow Tchoglokoff had sent for me; my alarm at what had been said between\r\nthe husband and wife, and the visit which the Empress had paid me. His\r\nanswer was: \"If that be the case, I am of opinion that the Empress must\r\nhave come to see what you do in the absence of your husband; and, in\r\norder that it may be seen that you are perfectly alone, both in your own\r\napartments and in those of the Tchoglokoffs, I will be off, and take all\r\nmy comrades to the house of Ivan Schouvaloff, just as we are,\r\nbespattered with mud up to our eyes.\" And, in fact, when the Grand Duke\r\nretired, he went off with all those who had been riding with his\r\nImperial Highness to Ivan Schouvaloff, who had apartments at the court.\r\nWhen they arrived there, Schouvaloff asked them questions about their\r\nride, and Soltikoff told me afterwards that, from these questions, it\r\nseemed to him that he had been correct in his inference.\r\n\r\nFrom this day the illness of Tchoglokoff grew worse and worse. On the\r\n21st of April--my birth-day--the physicians pronounced him beyond hope\r\nof recovery. The Empress was informed of this, and gave orders (as she\r\nwas accustomed to do) that he should be carried to his own house, in\r\norder that he might not die at court, for she was afraid of the dead. I\r\nwas very much grieved on learning his condition. He died at the very\r\ntime when, after many years of trouble and pain, we had succeeded in\r\nrendering him not only less ill-natured and mischievous, but even\r\ntractable, and when, by dint of studying his character, we had acquired\r\nthe power of managing him as we pleased. As for his wife, she at this\r\ntime loved me sincerely, and, from a harsh and spiteful Argus, had\r\nbecome a firm and attached friend. Tchoglokoff, after his removal to his\r\nown house, lived until the afternoon of the 25th of April, the day of\r\nthe Empress' coronation, when he died. I was immediately informed of the\r\nevent, as I kept constantly sending to his house. I was truly sorry for\r\nhim, and wept a good deal. His wife, too, was confined to her bed during\r\nthe last days of her husband's illness; he was at one side of the house,\r\nshe in the other. Serge Soltikoff and Leon Narichkine happened to be in\r\nher room at the moment of her husband's death; the windows being open, a\r\nbird flew into the room, and alighted on the cornice of the ceiling,\r\nright opposite to Madame Tchoglokoff's bed. Upon seeing this, she said,\r\n\"I am certain that my husband has just breathed his last; send and ask\r\nhow he is.\" She was informed that he was really dead. She said that that\r\nbird was the soul of her husband. They tried to prove to her that the\r\nbird was an ordinary bird; but then it could not be found. They said it\r\nhad flown away, but as no one had seen it, she remained convinced that\r\nit was the soul of her husband who had come to find her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the funeral was over, Madame Tchoglokoff wished to come to my\r\nrooms. The Empress seeing her passing along the Yaousa bridge, sent her\r\nword that she would dispense with her attendance on me, and that she\r\nmight return to her own house. Her Imperial Majesty took it ill that, as\r\na widow, she should have gone out so soon. The same day she named M.\r\nAlexander Ivanovitch Schouvaloff to discharge the duties of the late M.\r\nTchoglokoff in the Grand Duke's court. Now this M. Schouvaloff, not so\r\nmuch on his own account as from the place he held, was the terror of the\r\ncourt, the city, and the whole empire. He was the chief of the tribunal\r\nof the state inquisition, which was then called the Secret Chancery. His\r\nfunctions, it was said, had given him a sort of convulsive movement,\r\nwhich seized the whole of the right side of his face from the eye to the\r\njaw, whenever he was affected either with joy, anger, fear, or anxiety.\r\nIt was astonishing that such a man, with so hideous a grimace, should\r\never have been chosen for a post which placed him continually in the\r\npresence of a pregnant young woman. Had I been delivered of an infant\r\nhaving that same wretched twitch, I think the Empress would have been\r\ngreatly vexed, and this might have happened, seeing him as I did\r\nconstantly, never with my own wish, and, for the greater part of the\r\ntime, with a shudder of involuntary repugnance, on account of his\r\npersonal appearance, his connections, and his office, by which, as may\r\neasily be imagined, the pleasure of his society was not likely to be\r\naugmented. But this was only a beginning of the \"good times\" they were\r\npreparing for us, and especially for me. The next morning I was informed\r\nthat the Empress was going to place with me again the Countess\r\nRoumianzoff. I knew that she was the sworn enemy of Serge Soltikoff,\r\nthat she bore no love to the Princess Gagarine, and that she had greatly\r\ninjured my mother in the estimation of the Empress. The moment I became\r\naware of this arrangement, I lost all patience. I wept bitterly, and\r\ntold Count Schouvaloff that if the Countess Roumianzoff was placed with\r\nme I should look upon it as a great misfortune; that this lady had\r\nalready injured my mother, had blackened her in the eyes of the Empress,\r\nand that now she would do the same with me; that she was feared as a\r\npest when she was formerly in our suite, and that there would be many\r\nrendered miserable by the arrangement if he could not find means to\r\nprevent it. He promised to do what he could, and tried to tranquillize\r\nme. As, in my situation, he dreaded the effect of such excitement, he\r\nwent at once to the Empress, and on his return told me that he hoped the\r\nCountess Roumianzoff would not be placed about my person. And, in fact,\r\nI heard no more of the matter, and nothing was now thought of but our\r\ndeparture for St. Petersburg. It was settled that we should be\r\ntwenty-nine days on the road; that is to say, that we should only travel\r\none post-station each day. I was frightened to death lest Serge\r\nSoltikoff and Leon Narichkine should be left behind at Moscow; but I\r\nknow not how it was, they had the condescension to inscribe their names\r\nin the list of our suite.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 10th, or the 11th, we set out from the palace of Moscow.\r\nI was in a carriage with the wife of Count Alexander Schouvaloff, the\r\nmost tiresome woman that it is possible to imagine. Madame Vladislava,\r\nand the midwife, whom, as I was pregnant, they said I could not do\r\nwithout, were with us. I was tired to death in that carriage, and did\r\nnothing but cry. At last, the Princess Gagarine, who personally disliked\r\nthe Countess Schouvaloff, because her daughter, who was married to\r\nGolofkine, a cousin of the Princess, made herself disagreeable to the\r\nrelatives of her husband, seized a moment when she could get near me to\r\nsay that she was working hard to make Madame Vladislava favourable to\r\nme, as she feared, as did every one else, that the hypochondria which my\r\ncondition produced might do me harm, as well as injure my child.\r\nSoltikoff, she said, dared not come near me, because of the restraint\r\nand constant presence of the Schouvaloffs, both husband and wife. She\r\ndid, in fact, succeed in getting Madame Vladislava to listen to reason,\r\nand condescend so far as to mitigate a little the state of perpetual\r\nannoyance and restraint which gave rise to this hypochondria which I\r\nfound it impossible to control. All I wanted was the merest trifle--only\r\na few moments of conversation. At last she succeeded. After this tedious\r\njourney of twenty-nine days, we reached St. Petersburg and the Summer\r\nPalace. The Grand Duke at once re-established his concerts. This gave me\r\nsometimes the opportunity of a little conversation; but my hypochondria\r\nhad become such that at every moment, and at every word, my eyes filled\r\nwith tears, and my mind was disturbed with apprehensions; in a word, I\r\ncould not get it out of my head that everything tended to the removal of\r\nSerge Soltikoff.\r\n\r\nWe went to Peterhoff. I walked a great deal, but in spite of this my\r\nmelancholy followed me. In the month of August we returned to the city,\r\nto occupy again the Summer Palace. It was a death-blow to me when I\r\nlearned that, for my accouchement, they were preparing apartments close\r\nto, and forming part of those belonging to the Empress. Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff took me to see them; I found two rooms, gloomy, and with\r\nonly one issue, like all those of the Summer Palace; the hangings were\r\nof ugly crimson damask, there was scarcely any furniture, and no kind of\r\nconvenience. I saw that I should be isolated there, without any sort of\r\ncompany, and thoroughly wretched. I said so to Soltikoff and to the\r\nPrincess Gagarine, who, though they bore no love to each other, had\r\nnevertheless a point of union in their friendship for me. They saw the\r\nmatter as I did, but it was impossible to remedy it. I was to go on the\r\nWednesday to these apartments, which were far removed from those of the\r\nGrand Duke. I went to bed on Tuesday evening, and in the night awoke\r\nwith labour-pains. I called Madame Vladislava, who went to fetch the\r\nmidwife. She pronounced that I was in labour. The Grand Duke, who was\r\nsleeping in his own room, was awakened, as also Count Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff. The latter sent word to the Empress, who was not long in\r\ncoming. It was about two o'clock in the morning. I was very ill. At\r\nlast, towards noon the next day, the 20th September, I gave birth to a\r\nson. As soon as it was dressed the Empress called in her confessor, who\r\ngave the child the name of Paul, after which the Empress immediately\r\nbade the midwife take the child up and follow her. I remained on the bed\r\non which I had been confined. Now this bed was placed opposite a door\r\nthrough which I could see the light; behind me were two large windows\r\nwhich did not close properly, and on the right and left of this bed were\r\ntwo doors, one of which opened into my dressing-room, and the other into\r\nthe room in which Madame Vladislava slept. As soon as the Empress left,\r\nthe Grand Duke also went away, as likewise did M. and Madame\r\nSchouvaloff, and I saw no one again until three o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. I had perspired a great deal, and begged Madame Vladislava to\r\nchange my linen, and put me into my own bed, but she told me that she\r\ndared not. She sent several times to call the midwife, who, however, did\r\nnot come. I asked for something to drink, but still received the same\r\nanswer. At last, after three hours, the Countess Schouvaloff arrived,\r\nvery elaborately dressed. When she saw me lying just where she had left\r\nme, she was very angry, and said it was enough to kill me. This was very\r\nconsolatory, certainly. I had been in tears from the time of my\r\ndelivery, pained by the neglect in which I was left, after a severe\r\nlabour; uncomfortably accommodated, lying between doors and windows,\r\nwhich did not shut close, no one daring to lift me into my bed, which\r\nwas not two paces off, and to which I had not the strength to crawl.\r\nMadame Schouvaloff departed immediately, and went, I think, to fetch the\r\nmidwife; for the latter came in about half an hour afterwards, and told\r\nus that the Empress was so taken up with the child that she would not\r\nlet her go away for a moment. As for me no one gave me a thought. This\r\nforgetfulness or neglect was not at all flattering. I was dying of\r\nthirst. At last they placed me on my bed, and I did not see a living\r\nsoul for the rest of the day, nor did any one send even to ask after me.\r\nThe Grand Duke, for his part, did nothing but drink with all he could\r\nfind, and the Empress was taken up with the child. In the city and\r\nthroughout the empire the joy at this event was great. The next day I\r\nbegan to feel an excruciating rheumatic pain, from the hip down the\r\nthigh and left leg. This pain prevented me from sleeping, and this\r\nbrought on a violent fever. In spite of all this, the attentions I\r\nreceived next day were just of the same character. I saw no one, and no\r\none inquired after me. The Grand Duke, indeed, did come into my room for\r\na moment, and then went away, saying, that he had not time to stop. I\r\ndid nothing but weep and moan in my bed. Nobody was in my room but\r\nMadame Vladislava; in her heart she was sorry for me, but she had not\r\nthe power to remedy this state of things. Besides, I never liked to be\r\npitied nor to complain. I had too proud a spirit for that, and the very\r\nidea of being unhappy, was insupportable to me. Hitherto I had done\r\nwhatever I could not to appear so. I might have seen Count Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff and his wife, but they were such insipid and tiresome people\r\nthat I was always delighted when they were not present. On the third day\r\na messenger came from the Empress to Madame Vladislava to ask if a blue\r\nsatin mantelet which her Imperial Majesty had worn on the day of my\r\naccouchement, had been left in my room. Madame Vladislava searched for\r\nit everywhere in my rooms, and it was at last found in a corner of my\r\ndressing-room, where it had not been noticed, as, since my confinement,\r\nthat room had seldom been entered. Having found it, she sent it off\r\nimmediately. This mantelet, as we afterwards learned, gave rise to a\r\nsomewhat singular occurrence. The Empress had no fixed hours either for\r\ngoing to bed or getting up, for dinner, supper nor dressing. On one of\r\nthose three days she was lying, after dinner on a sofa on which she had\r\nplaced a mattress and pillows. While there, feeling cold, she asked for\r\nthis mantelet. It was sought for everywhere, but could not be found, as\r\nit had been left in my room. The Empress then ordered that it should be\r\nlooked for under the pillows of her bed, believing that it would be\r\nfound there. The sister of Madame Krause, the Empress' favourite lady's\r\nmaid, passed her hand under the bolster of her Majesty's bed and drew it\r\nback, saying, that there was no mantle there, but there was a packet of\r\nhair there, or something like it, she did not know what. The Empress\r\nimmediately rose from her place, and had the mattress and the pillows\r\ntaken up, and under them was found, to their no small astonishment, a\r\npaper in which was some hair twisted round the roots of some herbs. Upon\r\nthis her Majesty's maids, and the Empress herself, said that assuredly\r\nit was some charm or witchcraft, and every one began guessing who it\r\ncould be that had the hardihood to place the packet under the Empress'\r\npillow. Suspicion lighted on one of those most in the favour of her\r\nImperial Majesty. She was known by the name of Anna Dmitrevna\r\nDoumacheva. Not long since she had become a widow, and had married a\r\nsecond time a valet de chambre in the service of the Empress. The\r\nSchouvaloffs did not like this woman, who was in their way, as well by\r\nthe esteem in which she was held as by the confidence reposed in her by\r\nthe Empress ever since her youth. She was quite capable of playing them\r\nsome trick which might diminish their influence. As they were not\r\nwithout their partisans, these began to view the matter in a criminal\r\nlight; to this view the Empress was of herself sufficiently disposed,\r\nsince she believed in charms and sorcery. Consequently, she gave orders\r\nto Count Alexander Schouvaloff to have the woman arrested, together with\r\nher husband and her two sons, one of whom was an officer of the guards,\r\nand the other a page of the chamber to her Majesty. Her husband, two\r\ndays after his arrest, asked for a razor to shave with, and cut his\r\nthroat with it. As for the wife and her two children, they were a long\r\ntime under arrest, and she confessed that, with a view to prolong the\r\nEmpress' favour, she had made use of charms, and had on Holy Thursday\r\nput some grains of burnt salt into a glass of Hungarian wine, which she\r\nhad presented to the Empress. The affair was concluded by banishing the\r\nwoman and her two sons to Moscow. A rumour was afterwards set afloat\r\nthat a fainting fit, which the Empress had a little time before my\r\naccouchement, was caused by the drink which this woman had given to her.\r\nIt is certain, however, that she never gave her more than two or three\r\ngrains of burnt salt, which most assuredly could never have hurt her.\r\nIn all this there was nothing reprehensible, but the woman's rashness\r\nand superstition.\r\n\r\nAt last the Grand Duke, growing weary of his evenings passed without my\r\nladies of honour, came and proposed to spend an evening in my room. At\r\nthis time he was courting the very ugliest of these ladies, Elizabeth\r\nVoronzoff. On the sixth day my son's baptism took place. He had already\r\ncome near dying of the thrush. It was only by stealth that I could get\r\nany account of him; for to have inquired about him would have passed for\r\na doubt of the Empress' care, and would have been very ill received.\r\nBesides, she had taken him into her own room, and whenever he cried she\r\nherself would run to him, and, through excess of care, they were\r\nliterally stifling him. He was kept in a room extremely warm, wrapped up\r\nin flannel, and laid in a cradle, lined with black fox furs; over him\r\nwas a coverlet of quilted satin, lined with wadding, and above this one\r\nof rose-coloured velvet, lined with black fox skins. I saw him myself,\r\nmany times afterwards, lying in this style, the perspiration running\r\nfrom his face and whole body, and hence it was that, when older, the\r\nleast breath of air that reached him chilled him and made him ill.\r\nBesides, he had in attendance on him a great number of aged matrons who,\r\nby their ill-judged cares, and their want of common sense, did him\r\ninfinitely more harm than good, both physically and morally.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his baptism, after the ceremony, the Empress came into my\r\nroom, and brought me, on a golden salver, an order on her cabinet for\r\n100,000 roubles. She had added to it a small casket, which I did not\r\nopen until she was gone. This money came very seasonably, for I had not\r\na sous, and was heavily in debt. As for the casket, when I opened it, I\r\nwas not greatly dazzled; it contained only a very poor necklace, with\r\near-rings and two wretched rings, such as I should have been ashamed to\r\ngive to my maids. In the whole case there was not a jewel worth 100\r\nroubles; neither was the taste nor workmanship any better. I said\r\nnothing, but locked up the imperial casket. It would seem that the\r\nmeanness of the present was felt, for Count Alexander Schouvaloff was\r\nordered to inquire how I liked the jewel-case. I replied, that whatever\r\ncame from the hands of the Empress was always of inestimable value in my\r\neyes. With that compliment he went away apparently well pleased. He\r\nreturned to the charge when he saw that I never wore this beautiful\r\nnecklace, and especially those miserable ear-rings, telling me to put\r\nthem on. I said that on the Empress' fêtes I was accustomed to wear the\r\nmost beautiful things I possessed, and that this necklace and ear-rings\r\ndid not come within that category.\r\n\r\nFour or five days after the money ordered by the Empress was brought to\r\nme, Baron Tcherkassoff, her secretary of the cabinet, sent to beg of me,\r\nfor Heaven's sake, to lend it again to the cabinet, because the Empress\r\nhad asked for money, and there was not a sou left. I sent it back to\r\nhim, and he repaid me in the month of January. The Grand Duke having\r\nheard of the present made me by the Empress, got into a terrible passion\r\nbecause nothing had been given to him. He complained vehemently to Count\r\nAlexander Schouvaloff. The latter told the Empress, who immediately sent\r\nthe Duke an order for a similar sum, and it was to meet this demand that\r\nmy money was borrowed. The truth is, the Schouvaloffs were very timid,\r\nand it was by this weakness that they were to be led; but this trait had\r\nnot then been discovered.\r\n\r\nAfter my son's baptism, there were fêtes, balls, illuminations, and\r\nfireworks at court. As for me, I was all the while in bed, ill, and\r\nsuffering dreadfully from _ennui_. At last they chose the seventeenth\r\nday after my confinement to announce to me two pieces of agreeable news\r\nat once. First of all, that Serge Soltikoff had been selected to carry\r\nthe news of the birth of my son to Sweden; secondly, that the marriage\r\nof the Princess Gagarine was fixed for the following week; that is to\r\nsay, in plain language, that I was about to be deprived, almost\r\nimmediately, of the two persons I most liked of all who were about me. I\r\nburied myself more than ever in my bed, where I did nothing but grieve.\r\nIn order to be able to keep to it, I pretended an increase of the pains\r\nin my thigh, which prevented my getting up; but the truth was, I neither\r\ncould nor would see anybody, I felt so miserable.\r\n\r\nDuring my confinement, the Grand Duke had also a great affliction, for\r\nhe learned from Count Alexander Schouvaloff, that one of his old\r\nhuntsmen, named Bastien, whom the Empress a few years before had ordered\r\nto marry Mademoiselle Schenck, my old lady's-maid, had come to give\r\ninformation of his having heard, from some one or other, that Bressan\r\nwished to give something or other to the Duke to drink. Now this Bastien\r\nwas a great scoundrel and drunkard, who from time to time used to drink\r\nwith his Imperial Highness, and having quarrelled with Bressan, whom he\r\nsupposed to stand higher in the Duke's favour than himself, thought to\r\ndo him an ill turn. The Duke was fond of them both. Bastien was sent to\r\nthe fortress; Bressan expected to be sent there also, but escaped with\r\nnothing worse than the fright. The huntsman was banished the country,\r\nand sent to Holstein with his wife, while Bressan retained his place\r\nbecause he served as a general spy. Serge Soltikoff, after some delays,\r\noccasioned by the usual dilatoriness of the Empress in signing papers,\r\nat last took his departure. The Princess Gagarine, in the meanwhile, was\r\nmarried at the time fixed.\r\n\r\nWhen the forty days of my confinement were over, the Empress, on\r\noccasion of the churching, came a second time into my chamber. I had\r\nrisen from my bed to receive her, but she saw that I was so weak and\r\nexhausted, that she made me sit down during the prayers which were read\r\nby her confessor. My child was brought into the room; it was the first\r\ntime I had seen him since his birth. I thought him very pretty, and the\r\nsight of him raised my spirits a little; but the moment the prayers were\r\nfinished, the Empress had him carried away, and then left me. The 1st of\r\nNovember was fixed by her Majesty for my receiving the customary\r\nfelicitations after the six weeks of my confinement. For this purpose,\r\nthe room next to mine was magnificently fitted up, and there, seated on\r\na couch of rose-colored velvet, embroidered with silver, everyone came\r\nto kiss my hand. The Empress came also, and from my apartments she went\r\nto the Winter Palace, and we received orders to follow her two or three\r\ndays after. We were lodged in the apartments formerly occupied by my\r\nmother, and which properly formed a part of Yagoujisky House, and half\r\nof Ragousinsky House; the other half being occupied by the Department of\r\nForeign Affairs. The Winter Palace was at this time in course of\r\nerection near the great Square.\r\n\r\nI passed from the Summer to the Winter Palace, with the firm resolution\r\nof not quitting my room as long as I did not feel myself strong enough\r\nto conquer my hypochondria. I read at this period the history of\r\nGermany, and the Universal History of Voltaire. After these I read,\r\nduring this winter, as many Russian works as I could procure; among\r\nothers two immense volumes of Baronius, translated into Russian; next I\r\nlit upon the Esprit des Lois of Montesquieu, after which I read the\r\nannals of Tacitus, which caused a singular revolution in my brain, to\r\nwhich, perhaps, the melancholy cast of my thoughts at this period\r\ncontributed not a little. I began to take gloomier views of things, and\r\nto look for more hidden and interested motives in the occurrences around\r\nme. I gathered all my strength in order to be able to go out at\r\nChristmas, and, in fact, I was present at divine service; but while at\r\nchurch I was seized with a shivering and with pains all over my body, so\r\nthat upon my return home I undressed and went to bed, my bed being\r\nmerely a pallet, which I had placed before a blocked-up door, through\r\nwhich it seemed to me that no draughts could come, as in addition to a\r\ncurtain lined with woollen cloth, there was also before it a large\r\nscreen; but yet I believe it was the cause of all the colds which\r\nafflicted me this winter. The day after Christmas, the violence of the\r\nfever was so great that I became delirious. When I shut my eyes I saw\r\nnothing but the ill-drawn figures of the tiles of the stove, which was\r\nat the foot of my pallet, the room being small and narrow. As to my\r\nbed-room, I never went into it at all, for it was very cold, as the\r\nwindows, on two sides, looked out upon the Neva, towards the east and\r\nnorth. A second reason which banished me from it, was the proximity of\r\nthe Grand Duke's apartments, where all day long, and for a part of the\r\nnight, there was a noise and racket just like that of a guard-house.\r\nBesides this, as he and all his associates smoked a great deal, the\r\ndisagreeable smoke and smell of tobacco was perceptible there. I\r\nremained, therefore, all the winter in this poor little narrow chamber,\r\nwhich had two windows and a pier between them, so that, in all, the area\r\nmay have been seven or eight archines in length, by four in breadth,\r\nwith three doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1755.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus commenced the year 1755. From Christmas-day to Lent there was\r\nnothing but fêtes in the city and the court. It was still, in every\r\ncase, in honour of the birth of my son that they were given. Every one\r\nin turn vied with his neighbour--all eager to give the most splendid\r\ndinners, balls, masquerades, illuminations, and fireworks. Under the\r\nplea of illness, I did not assist at any of them.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of Lent, Serge Soltikoff returned from Sweden. During\r\nhis absence, the High Chancellor, Count Bestoujeff, sent me all the news\r\nhe received of him, as well as the despatches of Count Panine, at that\r\ntime Envoy of Russia to the Swedish Court. They reached me through\r\nMadame Vladislava, who received them from her step-son, chief clerk to\r\nthe High Chancellor, and I sent them back by the same way. I further\r\nlearned by the same channel, that it was decided that on his return\r\nSoltikoff should be sent to Hamburg as resident minister of Russia, in\r\nplace of Prince Alexander Galitzine, who was appointed to the army. This\r\nnew arrangement did not diminish my sadness.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival, Serge Soltikoff requested me, through Leon Narichkine,\r\nto let him know if there was any possibility of his coming to see me. I\r\nspoke to Madame Vladislava, who consented to our interview. He was to\r\ncome to her rooms, and thence to mine. I waited for him until three\r\no'clock in the morning, and was in deadly anxiety as to what could have\r\nprevented his coming. I learned next day that he had been enticed by\r\nCount Roman Voronzoff into a lodge of Free Masons, and he pretended that\r\nhe could not get away without giving rise to suspicions. But I\r\nquestioned and cross-questioned Leon Narichkine to such a degree, that I\r\nsaw as clear as the day that he had failed in his engagement from\r\ncarelessness and want of interest, regardless of all I had so long\r\nsuffered solely from my attachment to him. Leon Narichkine himself,\r\nalthough his friend, did not offer much, if any excuse for him. To tell\r\nthe truth, I was greatly annoyed, and wrote him a letter, in which I\r\ncomplained bitterly of his indifference. He answered it, and came to see\r\nme. He had little difficulty in appeasing me, for I was only too well\r\ndisposed to accept his apologies. He recommended me to go into public: I\r\nfollowed his advice, and made my appearance on the 10th of February, the\r\nbirthday of the Grand Duke, as well as Shrove Tuesday. I had prepared\r\nfor the occasion a superb dress of blue velvet, embroidered with gold.\r\nAs during my solitude, I had thought a great deal, I now determined\r\nthat, as far as depended on myself, I would make those who had\r\noccasioned me so many and such various annoyances, feel that I was not\r\nto be offended with impunity, and that it was not by ill-treatment they\r\ncould hope to gain either my affection or approbation. In consequence, I\r\nneglected no opportunity of proving to the Schouvaloffs my feelings\r\ntowards them. I treated them with profound contempt, pointed out to\r\nothers their stupidity and ill-nature, turned them into ridicule\r\nwherever I could, and had always some sarcasm ready to fling at them,\r\nwhich afterwards flew through the city, and gratified malignity at their\r\nexpense: in a word, I took my revenge upon them in every way I could\r\nthink of, and, in their presence, never failed to distinguish, by my\r\nattentions, those whom they disliked. As there were a great many people\r\nwho hated them, I was never at a loss for subjects. The Counts\r\nRasoumowsky, whom I had always liked, were caressed more than ever. I\r\nredoubled my politeness and attention to every one except the\r\nSchouvaloffs. In a word, I drew myself up, and, with head erect, stood\r\nforth rather like the chief of a great party than a person humbled and\r\noppressed. The Schouvaloffs knew not what to make of me. They took\r\ncounsel, and had recourse to the tricks and intrigues of courtiers. At\r\nthis time there appeared in Russia, one Brockdorf, a gentleman from\r\nHolstein, who, on a former visit, had been sent back over the frontiers,\r\nby the party then in power, Brummer and Berkholz, because he was known\r\nto be an intriguer, and a person of very bad character. This man came on\r\nthe scene quite opportunely for the Schouvaloffs. As he had a key, as\r\nChamberlain to the Grand Duke, in his character of Duke of Holstein,\r\nthis gave him the _entrée_ to his Imperial Highness, who, moreover, was\r\nfavourably disposed towards every fool who came from that country.\r\nBrockdorf gained an introduction to Count Peter Schouvaloff, in the\r\nfollowing manner: In the inn where he lodged, he formed the acquaintance\r\nof a man who never left the inns of St. Petersburg unless it were to\r\nvisit three young and rather pretty German girls, named Reifenstein, one\r\nof whom enjoyed a pension allowed her by Count Peter Schouvaloff. This\r\nman was called Braun; he was a kind of agent for all sorts of matters.\r\nHe introduced Brockdorf at the house of these girls, where he formed the\r\nacquaintance of Count Peter Schouvaloff. The latter made great\r\nprotestations of affection for the Grand Duke, and by degrees complained\r\nof me. All this M. Brockdorf reported to the Grand Duke, at the first\r\nopportunity, and they stirred him up until he determined, as he\r\nexpressed it, to bring his wife to her senses. With this view, his\r\nImperial Highness came into my room one day after dinner, and told me\r\nthat I was becoming intolerably proud, but that he would bring me to my\r\nsenses. I asked him in what my pride consisted. He answered that I held\r\nmyself very erect. I asked whether, in order to please him, I must stoop\r\nlike the slaves of the Grand Seignior. He got angry, and said, he knew\r\nhow to bring me to reason. I inquired how this was to be done. Thereupon\r\nhe placed his back against the wall, and half unsheathing his sword,\r\nshowed it to me. I asked what he meant by that, for if he meant to fight\r\nme, why then I must have one too. He replaced his half-drawn sword in\r\nthe scabbard, and told me that I had become dreadfully spiteful. \"In\r\nwhat respect?\" I said. He replied, with a stammer, \"Why, to the\r\nSchouvaloffs.\" To this I answered that it was only tit for tat, and that\r\nhe had better not meddle with matters which he knew nothing about, and\r\ncould not understand. Upon this he exclaimed, \"See what it is not to\r\ntrust one's true friends; one suffers for it. If you had confided in me,\r\nit would have been well for you.\" \"But in what should I have confided in\r\nyou?\" I said. Then he began talking in a manner so utterly extravagant,\r\nthat finding it useless to reason with him, I let him go on without\r\ninterruption, and seized a favourable moment to advise him to go to bed,\r\nfor I saw clearly that wine had disturbed his reason and stupefied what\r\nlittle sense he naturally possessed. He followed my advice, and retired.\r\nAt this time he began to have always about him an odour of wine mingled\r\nwith that of tobacco, which was really insupportable to all who came\r\nclose to him. The same evening, while I was playing at cards, Count\r\nAlexander Schouvaloff came to me to signify, on behalf of the Empress,\r\nthat she had forbidden the ladies to use in their dress certain articles\r\nof ornament specified in the announcement. To show him how far his\r\nImperial Highness had corrected me, I laughed at him to his face, and\r\ntold him he might have saved himself the trouble of notifying the order\r\nto me, since I never wore any ornaments which were displeasing to her\r\nImperial Majesty; and that, besides, I did not make my merit consist in\r\nbeauty nor in ornament, for that when the one had faded, the other was\r\nridiculous, and that there was nothing permanent but character. He\r\nlistened to this to the end, winking his right eye, as was his custom,\r\nand then went off with his grimaces. I called the attention of those who\r\nwere with me to this peculiarity, which I mimicked, making every one\r\nlaugh. A few days afterwards the Grand Duke told me he wished to ask the\r\nEmpress for money for his affairs in Holstein, which were getting worse\r\nand worse every day, and that Brockdorf had advised him to do so. I saw\r\nvery clearly that they were but holding out a bait to him, to make him\r\nhope for this money through the intervention of the Schouvaloffs. I\r\nasked if there was no means of managing without it. He said he would\r\nshow me the representations which had been made to him from Holstein, on\r\nthat head. He did so, and after perusing the papers which he laid before\r\nme, I said that it seemed to me he might manage without going begging to\r\nhis aunt, who, besides, might refuse him, as she had given him, not six\r\nmonths ago, 100,000 roubles. However he kept to his own opinion, and I\r\nto mine. For a long time he was buoyed up with hopes, but in the end he\r\ngot nothing.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter we went to Oranienbaum. Before we set off, the Empress\r\nallowed me to see my son for the third time since his birth. It was\r\nnecessary to go through all the apartments of her Imperial Majesty to\r\nget to his chamber, where I found him in a stifling heat, as I have\r\nalready mentioned. On reaching the country we witnessed a phenomenon.\r\nHis Imperial Highness--though his Holstein subjects were continually\r\npreaching to him of a deficit, while everybody was advising him to\r\ndiminish his useless retinue, which, after all, he could only see by\r\nstealth and piecemeal--suddenly took the daring resolution of bringing\r\nover an entire detachment. This again was a contrivance of that wretch\r\nBrockdorf, who flattered the ruling passion of the Prince. To the\r\nSchouvaloffs he represented that, by conniving at this hobby, they would\r\nfor ever ensure his favour, make him wholly theirs, and be certain of\r\nhis approbation in whatever they undertook. From the Empress, who\r\ndetested Holstein, and all that came from it, who had seen how similar\r\nmilitary crotchets had ruined the Grand Duke's father, the Duke Charles\r\nFrederick, in the opinion of Peter I. and of the Russian public, it\r\nwould seem that the matter was so far concealed as to be represented to\r\nher as a mere trifle, not worth speaking of; while, besides, the mere\r\npresence of Count Schouvaloff was sufficient to prevent the affair from\r\nassuming any consequence. Having embarked at Kiel, the detachment landed\r\nat Cronstadt, and then marched to Oranienbaum. The Grand Duke, who in\r\nTchoglokoff's time had never worn the Holstein uniform, except in his\r\nown room, and by stealth, as it were, now wore no other, except on court\r\ndays, although he was lieutenant-colonel of the Preobrajensky regiment,\r\nand had besides a regiment of cuirassiers in Russia. From me, the Grand\r\nDuke, by Brockdorf's advice, kept the transport of these troops a great\r\nsecret. I own that when I became aware of it, I shuddered at the\r\ninjurious effect which such a proceeding could not fail to have on the\r\nminds of the Russian people, as well as in the opinion of the Empress,\r\nof whose sentiments I was not at all ignorant. M. Alexander Schouvaloff\r\nsaw the detachment defile before the balcony at Oranienbaum, winking all\r\nthe while: I was by his side. In his heart he disapproved of what he and\r\nhis relations had agreed to tolerate. The guard of the Château of\r\nOranienbaum belonged to the regiment of Inguermanie, which alternated\r\nwith that of Astracan. I was informed that, when they saw the Holstein\r\ntroops pass, they muttered, \"Those cursed Germans are all sold to the\r\nKing of Prussia; it is so many traitors they are bringing into Russia.\"\r\nGenerally speaking, the public was shocked at the apparition; the more\r\nearnest shrugged their shoulders, the more moderate looked upon it as\r\nsimply ridiculous; in reality, it was a childish freak, but a very\r\nimprudent one. As for me, I was silent, though, when the matter was\r\nmentioned to me, I spoke my mind in such a manner as to show that I in\r\nno way approved of a proceeding which, under every point of view, could\r\nnot but be injurious to the Grand Duke's interests. In fact, how was it\r\npossible to arrive at any other conclusion? His mere pleasure could not\r\ncompensate for the injury which such a proceeding must do him in public\r\nopinion. But the Duke, enchanted with his troop, took up his quarters in\r\nthe camp which he had prepared for it, where he was constantly employed\r\nin exercising it. At last it required to be fed; but this had not been\r\nthought of. The matter, however, was pressing, and there were some\r\ndebates with the Marshal of the Court, who was not prepared for such a\r\ndemand. At last he yielded, and the servants of the Court, with the\r\nsoldiers of the Inguermanie regiment, on guard at the château, were\r\nemployed in conveying provisions for the newly arrived, from the kitchen\r\nof the château to the camp. The camp was at some distance from the\r\nhouse; neither the servants nor the soldiers received anything for their\r\ntrouble; one may easily understand the effect of so sapient an\r\narrangement. The soldiers said, \"They make us lackeys to those cursed\r\nGermans.\" The servants said, \"We have to wait upon a set of clowns.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I saw and heard what was going on, I resolved to keep myself at as\r\ngreat a distance as possible from this mischievous child's-play. The\r\ngentlemen of our court, who were married, had their wives with them;\r\nthis made up a tolerably numerous company; no one, not even the\r\ngentlemen, would have anything to do with this Holstein Camp, which the\r\nGrand Duke never left. Thus, surrounded by these courtiers, I was out as\r\nmuch as possible, but always on the side opposite to the camp, which we\r\nnever, by any chance, came near.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I took a fancy to form a garden at Oranienbaum,\r\nand as I knew that the Grand Duke would not give me an inch of ground\r\nfor that purpose, I begged Prince Galitzine to sell or cede to me about\r\none hundred toises of some waste land which belonged to his family in\r\nthe immediate vicinity of Oranienbaum, and had been long since\r\nabandoned. This land was owned by eight or ten members of the family,\r\nbut as it produced nothing, they willingly gave it up to me. I began\r\nthen to plan and plant, and as this was my first whim in the\r\nconstructive line, my plans assumed very grand proportions. My old\r\nsurgeon Gyon, seeing these things, said to me, \"What is the good of all\r\nthis? Now, mark my words; I prophesy that you will one day abandon all\r\nthis.\" His prediction was verified. But I required some amusement at\r\nthe time, and this exercise of imagination was one. At first I employed,\r\nin planting my garden, the gardener of Oranienbaum, whose name was\r\nLamberti. He had been in the service of the Empress, when she was\r\nprincess, on her estate at Zarskoe-Selo, whence he had been removed to\r\nOranienbaum. He was fond of predictions, and, among others, his\r\nprediction relative to the Empress had been fulfilled. He had prophesied\r\nthat she would ascend the throne. He told me, and repeated it as often\r\nas I was willing to listen to him, that I should become the Sovereign\r\nEmpress of Russia; that I should see sons, grandsons, and\r\ngreat-grandsons; and that I should die at the advanced age of more than\r\nfourscore years. He did more: he fixed the year of my accession to the\r\nthrone six years before the event. He was a very singular man, and one\r\nwho spoke with an assurance which nothing could disturb. He pretended\r\nthat the Empress was ill-disposed towards him, because he had foretold\r\nto her what had come to pass, and that she had removed him from\r\nZarskoe-Selo to Oranienbaum in consequence of being afraid of him.\r\n\r\nIt was at Whitsuntide, I think, that we were recalled from Oranienbaum\r\nto the city; and it was about the same time that the English Ambassador,\r\nthe Chevalier Williams,[12] came to Russia. He had in his suite Count\r\nPoniatowsky, a Pole, the son of the one who had followed the fortunes of\r\nCharles XII. of Sweden. After a short stay at the capital, we returned\r\nto Oranienbaum, where the Empress ordered us to keep the Festival of St.\r\nPeter. She did not come herself, because she did not wish to celebrate\r\nthe first _fête_ of my son Paul, which fell on the same day. She\r\nremained at Peterhoff, and there placed herself at a window, where she\r\nremained, it would seem, the whole day; for all who came to Oranienbaum\r\nsaid they had seen her at that window. A very large company assembled.\r\nThe dance took place in the hall at the entrance of my garden, and we\r\nafterwards supped there. The foreign ambassadors and ministers were\r\npresent. I remember that the English Ambassador, the Chevalier Williams,\r\nsat near me at supper, and that we kept up a conversation as agreeable\r\nas it was gay. As he was lively and well-informed, it was not difficult\r\nto carry on a conversation with him. I afterwards learned that he had\r\nbeen as much pleased as myself at this soirée and had spoken of me in\r\nhigh terms. This, indeed, was what always happened when I chanced to be\r\nwith those who suited me in mind and character, and, as at that time, I\r\ndid not excite so much envy, I was generally well spoken of. I was\r\nlooked upon as a woman of mind; and many of those more intimately\r\nacquainted with me, honoured me with their confidence, depended on me,\r\nasked my advice, and found themselves the better for following it. The\r\nGrand Duke had long since named me _Madame la Ressource_, and however\r\nangry or sulky he might be, if he found himself at a loss on any point,\r\nhe would come running to me, in his usual style, to get my advice, and\r\nthen be off again as fast as he could. I likewise remember, at this same\r\nfeast of St. Peter, at Oranienbaum, seeing Count Poniatowsky dancing,\r\nand I spoke to the Chevalier Williams about his father, and the mischief\r\nhe had done to Peter I. The English Ambassador spoke very favourably of\r\nthe son, and confirmed to me what I was already aware of, namely, that\r\nhis father and the Czartoriskys, his mother's family, then formed the\r\nRussian party in Poland; that the son had been placed under his care,\r\nand sent here in order to be brought up in the feelings of his family\r\ntowards Russia; and that they trusted he would succeed in this country.\r\nHe might then be about twenty-two or twenty-three years old. I replied\r\nthat, in general, I looked upon Russia as the stumbling-block of merit\r\nfor strangers, and considered that those who succeeded in Russia might\r\nsafely calculate upon success in every other part of Europe. This rule I\r\nhave always considered as infallible, for nowhere are people more quick\r\nin detecting the weak points, absurdities, and defects of a stranger\r\nthan in Russia. A stranger may be sure that nothing will be overlooked,\r\nfor, naturally, no Russian really likes a foreigner.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, I learned that the conduct of Sergius Soltikoff had\r\nbeen anything but prudent, whether in Sweden or at Dresden. Besides, he\r\nhad made love to all the women he met. At first I would not believe\r\nthese reports; but at last they came from so many quarters, that even\r\nhis friends could not exculpate him. This year I became more than ever\r\nattached to Anne Narichkine. Her brother-in-law, Leon, contributed much\r\nto this. He always made a third with us, and there was no end to his\r\nnonsense. He used sometimes to say to us, \"I have a _bijou_, which I\r\nmean to give to whichever of you two shall behave the best, and you will\r\nbe very much obliged to me for it.\" We let him talk on, without\r\ntroubling ourselves to inquire what this _bijou_ was.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, the Holstein troops were sent off by sea, and we went to\r\noccupy the Summer Palace. At this time Leon Narichkine fell ill of a\r\nburning fever, during which he sent me letters, which I could easily see\r\nwere not his own. I replied to him. In these letters he asked me for\r\nsweetmeats and such like trifles, and then returned thanks. The letters\r\nwere very well written, and very lively; he said he employed in them the\r\nhand of his secretary. This secretary, I at last learned was Count\r\nPoniatowsky, who never left him, and had become intimate with his\r\nfamily. From the Summer Palace we removed, about the beginning of\r\nwinter, to the new Winter Palace which the Empress had just built. It\r\nwas of wood, and occupied the spot where the mansion of the\r\nTchitcherines now stands. It took up the whole quarter as far as the\r\nresidence of the Countess Matiouchkine, which then belonged to Naoumoff.\r\nMy windows faced this house, which was occupied by the maids of honour.\r\nOn entering the apartments destined for us, I was very much struck with\r\ntheir size and loftiness. Four large ante-chambers and two chambers,\r\nwith a cabinet, were prepared for me, and the same number for the Grand\r\nDuke. The rooms, too, were so disposed, that I was not incommoded by the\r\nproximity of the Grand Duke's apartments. This was a great point gained.\r\nCount Alexander Schouvaloff noticed my satisfaction, and immediately\r\ninformed the Empress that I was greatly delighted with the number and\r\nsize of my apartments. This he told me afterwards with a kind of\r\nsatisfaction, indicated by a smile and the winking of his eye.\r\n\r\nAt this period, and for a long time afterwards, the principal plaything\r\nof the Grand Duke, while in town, consisted of an immense number of\r\nlittle dolls, representing soldiers, formed of wood, lead, pith, and\r\nwax. These he arranged on very narrow tables, which took up an entire\r\nroom, leaving scarcely space enough to pass between them. Along these\r\ntables he had nailed narrow bands of brass, to which strings were\r\nattached, and when he pulled these strings the brass bands made a noise\r\nwhich, according to him, resembled the roll of musketry. He observed the\r\ncourt festivals with great regularity, making these troops produce\r\ntheir rolling fire; besides which he daily relieved guard, that is to\r\nsay, from every table was picked out the dolls that were assumed to be\r\non guard. He assisted at this parade in full uniform, boots, spurs,\r\ngorget, and scarf. Such of his domestics as were admitted to this\r\nprecious exercise were obliged to appear in similar style.\r\n\r\nTowards the winter of this year, I thought myself again pregnant. I was\r\nbled. I had a cold, or, rather, I fancied I had one, in both sides of my\r\nface; but after some days of suffering, four double teeth made their\r\nappearance at the four extremities of my jaws. As our apartments were\r\nvery spacious, the Grand Duke had every week a ball and a concert. The\r\nonly persons who appeared at them were the maids of honour and the\r\ngentlemen of our court, together with their wives. These balls were\r\nthought interesting by those who assisted at them, who were never many.\r\nThe Narichkines were more companionable than the rest. Among them I\r\nreckon Madame Siniavine and Madame Ismaïloff, Leon's sisters, together\r\nwith the wife of his elder brother, of whom I have already spoken. Leon,\r\nmore absurd than ever, and regarded by every one as a person of no sort\r\nof consequence, as was indeed the case, had got into the habit of\r\nrunning continually backwards and forwards between the Grand Duke's\r\napartments and mine, never stopping long anywhere. In order to gain\r\nadmittance into my room, he used to mew like a cat at my door, and when\r\nI answered him, he would come in. On the 17th of December, between six\r\nand seven o'clock in the evening, he announced himself in this fashion,\r\nat my door; I desired him to come in. He began by presenting me with his\r\nsister-in-law's compliments, saying that she was not well; and adding,\r\n\"but you ought to go and see her.\" I replied, \"I would do so with\r\npleasure; but you know I cannot go out without permission, and they\r\nwill never give me permission to go to her house.\" \"Oh! I will take you\r\nthere,\" he said. \"Are you mad,\" I replied; \"how can I go with you? You\r\nwould be sent to the Fortress, and God knows what trouble I should get\r\ninto.\" \"Oh! but no one will know of it; we will take proper\r\nprecautions.\" \"But how?\" \"Why, in this way: I will come and fetch you in\r\nan hour or two's time. The Grand Duke will take supper\" (for a long time\r\npast, under the pretext of not wishing for supper, I had been in the\r\nhabit of staying in my own room); \"he will remain at table for a\r\nconsiderable part of the night, leave it very tipsy, and go to bed\"\r\n(since my confinement he generally slept in his own room); \"for greater\r\nsecurity you can dress in man's clothes, and we will go together to Anna\r\nNikitichna Narichkine's.\" I began to feel tempted by the adventure, for\r\nI was constantly in my room with my books, and without any company.\r\nFinally, by dint of debating this mad project, for such it really was,\r\nand such it appeared to me at first, I saw in it the possibility of\r\nobtaining a moment's relaxation and amusement. He departed, and I called\r\na Kalmuck hair-dresser in my service, and desired him to bring me one of\r\nmy male dresses, and all belonging to it, as I wanted to make it a\r\npresent to some one. This young man was one of those persons who keep\r\ntheir mouths closed; and it was more difficult to make him speak than it\r\nwas to make others hold their tongues. He executed his commission\r\npromptly, and brought me everything I wanted. I feigned a headache, and\r\nwent to bed early. As soon as Madame Vladislava had undressed me and\r\nretired, I got up and dressed myself from head to foot as a man,\r\narranging my hair in the best way I could. I was long in the habit of\r\ndoing this, and was by no means awkward at it. At the time appointed,\r\nNarichkine made his appearance. He came through the apartments of the\r\nGrand Duke, and mewed at my door. I opened it, and we passed through a\r\nsmall ante-chamber into the hall, and entered his carriage without\r\nhaving been seen by any one, laughing like a pair of fools at our\r\nescapade. Leon lived in the same house with his brother and\r\nsister-in-law.\r\n\r\nOn reaching it, we found there Anna Nikitichna, who suspected nothing,\r\nand also Count Poniatowsky. Leon announced one of his friends, whom he\r\nbegged might be well received, and the evening passed in the wildest\r\ngayety. After a visit of an hour and-a-half's duration, I took leave and\r\nreturned home without accident, and without having been met by any one.\r\nThe next day, which was the birthday of the Empress, both at court in\r\nthe morning, and at the ball in the evening, we could not look one\r\nanother in the face without being ready to burst out laughing at our\r\nlast night's folly. Some days later, Leon prepared a return visit, which\r\nwas to take place in my apartments; and, as before, he brought his\r\ncompany into my room so skilfully, that no suspicion was excited. Thus\r\nbegan the year 1756. We took a strange delight in these furtive\r\ninterviews. Not a week passed without one or two, and occasionally even\r\nthree of them taking place, sometimes at the residence of one party,\r\nsometimes at that of another; and if any of us happened to be ill, the\r\nvisit was always to the invalid. Sometimes at the theatre, without\r\nspeaking, and simply by means of certain signs previously agreed on,\r\neven although we might be in different boxes, and some of us, perhaps,\r\nin the pit; yet, by a sign, each one knew where to go, and no mistake\r\never occurred between us, except that on two occasions I had to return\r\nhome on foot, which, after all, was only a walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1756.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this period, preparations were making for a war with Prussia. The\r\nEmpress, by her treaty with the house of Austria, was bound to furnish a\r\ncontingent of thirty thousand men. Such was the view taken by the High\r\nChancellor Count Bestoujeff; but Austria wanted Russia to aid her with\r\nall her forces. Count Esterhazy, the Austrian Ambassador, was intriguing\r\nfor this object with all his skill, wherever he saw an opening, and\r\noften in several different channels at once. The party opposed to\r\nBestoujeff consisted of the Vice-Chancellor Count Voronzoff and the\r\nSchouvaloffs. England was at that time in alliance with Prussia, and\r\nFrance with Austria. The Empress began to have frequent indispositions.\r\nAt first it was not known what was the matter with her. The Schouvaloffs\r\nwere often seen to be very much disturbed, and full of intrigues, and\r\nfrom time to time they paid great attentions to the Grand Duke. The\r\ncourtiers whispered that these indispositions of her Imperial Majesty\r\nwere much more serious than was reported. Some called them hysterical\r\naffections, others fainting fits, or convulsions, or nervous complaints.\r\nThis state of things lasted the whole winter of 1755-1756. Finally, in\r\nthe spring we learned that Marshal Apraxine was about to depart in\r\ncommand of the army that was to enter Prussia. His lady came to take\r\nleave of us, accompanied by her youngest daughter. I mentioned to her my\r\napprehensions relative to the health of the Empress, stating that I much\r\nregretted the absence of her husband at a time in which I thought that\r\nlittle reliance was to be placed upon the Schouvaloffs, whom I looked\r\nupon as my personal enemies, and who were very ill-disposed towards me,\r\nbecause I preferred their enemies to them, and especially the Counts\r\nRazoumowsky. She repeated all this to her husband, who was much pleased\r\nwith my feelings towards him; so also was Count Bestoujeff, who disliked\r\nthe Schouvaloffs, and was connected with the Razoumowskys, his son\r\nhaving married their niece. Marshal Apraxine might have been a useful\r\nmediator between all interested, on account of the _liaison_ of his\r\ndaughter with Count Peter Schouvaloff: Leon pretended that this\r\n_liaison_ was carried on with the knowledge of her parents. Besides\r\nthis, I saw clearly that the Schouvaloffs made more use than ever of M.\r\nBrockdorf, for the purpose of estranging the Grand Duke from me as much\r\nas possible. Notwithstanding all this, he had still an involuntary\r\nconfidence in me; this he always retained to a remarkable extent,\r\nwithout being at all conscious of it himself. He had just then\r\nquarrelled with the Countess Voronzoff, and was in love with Madame\r\nTeploff, a niece of the Razoumowskys. When he wished to see this lady,\r\nhe consulted me as to the best mode of adorning his room so as to please\r\nher, and made me observe that he had filled it with muskets, grenadier\r\ncaps, shoulder belts, etc., so that it looked like a portion of an\r\narsenal. I let him do as he pleased, and went away. Besides this lady,\r\nhe also kept a little German singing girl, called Leonora, who used to\r\ncome to him of an evening, and sup with him. It was the Princess of\r\nCourland who had led to his quarrel with the Countess Voronzoff. Indeed,\r\nI do not very well know how it was that this Princess of Courland\r\nmanaged at that time to play a peculiar part at court. In the first\r\nplace, she was then nearly thirty years of age, little, ugly, and\r\nhumpbacked, as I have already said. She had contrived to secure the\r\nprotection of the confessor of the Empress, and of several old ladies of\r\nher Majesty's bed-chamber, so that every thing she did was excused, and\r\nshe remained among the Empress' maids of honour. All these were under\r\nthe rod of a Madame Schmidt, the wife of one of the court trumpeters.\r\nThis Madame Schmidt was a native of Finland, prodigiously large and\r\nmassive, one who knew how to ensure obedience, but who still retained\r\nthe coarse and vulgar manners of her former condition. She was of some\r\nconsequence, however, at court, being under the immediate protection of\r\nthe Empress' old German and Swedish lady's-maids, and consequently also\r\nunder that of the Marshal of the Court, Sievers, who was himself a Fin,\r\nand married to a daughter of Madame Krause, whose sister, as I have\r\nalready mentioned, was one of those lady's-maids, and one in special\r\nfavour with the Empress. Madame Schmidt ruled within the dwelling of the\r\nmaids of honour with more vigour than intelligence, but never appeared\r\nat court. In public, the Princess of Courland was at their head, and\r\nMadame Schmidt had tacitly confided to her their conduct at court. In\r\ntheir own house, they all lodged in a row of chambers, which terminated\r\nat one end in Madame Schmidt's room, and at the other in the one\r\noccupied by the Princess of Courland. There were two, three, or four in\r\na room, each having a screen round her bed, and the only exits from\r\nthese rooms were through each other. At first sight, it would seem that\r\nthis arrangement made the residence of the maids of honour impenetrable,\r\nfor it could only be reached by passing through Madame Schmidt's, or the\r\nPrincess of Courland's room. But Madame Schmidt often suffered from the\r\nindigestion occasioned by all the _pâtes gras_ and other dainties sent\r\nto her by the relatives of these young ladies, and then the only\r\napproach was by the Princess of Courland's chamber. Here scandal\r\nreported that it was necessary for those who wished to pass to any of\r\nthe rooms beyond, to pay toll in some form or other. At all events, it\r\nwas certain that for many years the Princess of Courland made up matches\r\nand broke them off again--promised and refused the Empress' maids of\r\nhonour just as she thought proper; and I have heard from the lips of\r\nmany persons, and among others from Leon Narichkine and Count\r\nBoutourline, the history of this toll, which, they pretended had not in\r\ntheir case been paid in money.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke's amours with Madame Teploff lasted until we went into\r\nthe country. Here they were interrupted, because his Imperial Highness\r\nwas insupportable during the summer. Not being able to see him, Madame\r\nTeploff pretended that he must write to her at least once or twice\r\na-week, and to induce him to do so, she began by writing him a letter of\r\nfour pages. On receiving it, he came into my room much out of temper,\r\nholding the letter in his hand, and said to me, in a tone of\r\nconsiderable irritation, \"Only fancy! she writes me a letter of four\r\nwhole pages, and expects that I should read it, and, what is more,\r\nanswer it also. I who have to go to parade (he had again brought his\r\ntroops from Holstein), then dine, then shoot, then attend the rehearsal\r\nof an opera, and the ballet which the cadets will dance at it! I will\r\ntell her plainly that I have not time, and if she is vexed, I will\r\nquarrel with her till winter.\" I told him that would certainly be the\r\nshortest way. These traits are, I think, characteristic, and they will\r\nnot therefore be out of place. Here is the explanation of the appearance\r\nof the cadets at Oranienbaum. In the spring of 1756, the Schouvaloffs\r\nthought, that with a view of detaching the Grand Duke from his Holstein\r\ntroops, it would be a good stroke of policy to persuade the Empress to\r\ngive his Imperial Highness the command of the corps of Land Cadets, the\r\nonly body of cadets then existing. Under him was placed A. P.\r\nMelgounoff, the intimate friend and confidant of Ivan Ivanovitch\r\nSchouvaloff. This person was married to one of the German lady's-maids,\r\na favourite of the Empress. In this way the Schouvaloffs had one of\r\ntheir most intimate friends in the Grand Duke's chamber, and with the\r\nopportunity of speaking to him at every moment. Under pretext of the\r\nopera-ballets at Oranienbaum, they brought there some hundred cadets,\r\ntogether with M. Melgounoff and the officers of the corps who were most\r\nintimate with him. These were so many spies _à la Schouvaloff_. Among\r\nthe masters who came to Oranienbaum with the cadets was their\r\nriding-master, Zimmerman, who was accounted the best horseman at that\r\ntime in Russia. As my supposed pregnancy of the last autumn had all\r\npassed off, I thought I would take some lessons in horsemanship from\r\nZimmerman. I spoke on the subject to the Grand Duke, who made no\r\ndifficulty. For a long time past all the old rules introduced by the\r\nTchoglokoffs were forgotten, neglected by, or altogether unknown to\r\nAlexander Schouvaloff, who, besides, was held in slight or no\r\nconsideration: we laughed at him, at his wife, his daughter, and his\r\nson-in-law, almost to their faces. They gave abundant room for it; for\r\nnever were faces more ignoble or mean looking than theirs. I had applied\r\nto Madame Schouvaloff the epithet of the \"pillar of salt.\" She was thin,\r\nand short, and stiff. Her avarice showed itself even in her dress. Her\r\npetticoats were always too narrow, and had a breadth less than was\r\nrequired, and than those of other ladies had. Her daughter, the Countess\r\nGolofkine, was similarly dressed. Their head-dresses and ruffles were\r\nmean, and had a look of stinginess about them, although these people\r\nwere very wealthy, and in all respects in easy circumstances. But they\r\nnaturally liked everything that was little and pinched--a true image of\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I came to take lessons in systematic riding, I again became\r\npassionately fond of this exercise. I rose every morning at six, dressed\r\nmyself in male attire, and went off to my garden, where I had a place\r\nprepared in the open air, which served me for a riding-school. I made\r\nsuch rapid progress, that Zimmerman frequently came running up to me\r\nwith tears in his eyes, and kissed my foot with a sort of uncontrollable\r\nenthusiasm. At other times he would exclaim, \"Never in my life have I\r\nhad a pupil who did me such credit, or who made such rapid progress in\r\nso short a time.\" At these lessons, there was no one present but my old\r\nsurgeon Gyon, a lady's-maid and some domestics. As I paid great\r\nattention to these lessons, and took them regularly every morning except\r\nSundays, Zimmerman rewarded my diligence with the silver spurs, which he\r\ngave me, according to the rules of the school. By the end of three weeks\r\nI had passed through all the gradations of the school, and towards\r\nautumn Zimmerman had a leaping-horse bought, after which he intended to\r\ngive me the stirrups. But the day before that fixed for my mounting, we\r\nreceived orders to return to town; the matter was therefore put off till\r\nthe following spring.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer Count Poniatowsky made a tour in Poland, from which\r\nhe returned with his credentials as minister of the King of Poland.\r\nBefore his departure he came to Oranienbaum, to take leave of us. He was\r\naccompanied by Count Horn, whom the King of Sweden, under the pretext of\r\nnotifying the death of his mother, my grandmother, had sent to Russia,\r\nin order to withdraw him from the persecutions of the French party,\r\notherwise called \"The Hats,\" against that of Russia, or \"The Caps.\"\r\nThis persecution became so fierce in Sweden at the diet of 1756, that\r\nalmost all the chiefs of the Russian party had their heads cut off this\r\nyear. Count Horn told me himself, that if he had not come to Russia, he\r\nwould certainly have been of the number.\r\n\r\nCount Poniatowsky and Count Horn remained two days at Oranienbaum. The\r\nfirst day the Grand Duke treated them very well, but on the second they\r\nwere in his way, for his thoughts were running on the wedding of one of\r\nhis huntsmen, at which he wished to be present for the purpose of\r\ndrinking. Finding that his guests still stayed, he left them there, and\r\nI had to do the honours of the house.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I took the company which had remained with us, and which\r\nwas not very numerous, to view the interior of the house. On reaching my\r\ncabinet, a little Italian greyhound that I had there, ran to meet us,\r\nand began to bark loudly at Count Horn, but when he perceived Count\r\nPoniatowsky, he seemed wild with delight. As the cabinet was very small,\r\nno one observed this but Leon Narichkine, his sister-in-law and myself.\r\nBut it did not escape the notice of Count Horn, and while I was going\r\nthrough the apartments to return to the saloon, Count Horn took\r\nPoniatowsky by the coat and said to him, \"My friend, there is nothing so\r\nterrible as a little Italian greyhound; the first thing I always do with\r\nthe ladies I am in love with is to give them one of these little dogs,\r\nand by this means I can always discover whether there is any one more\r\nfavoured than myself. The rule is infallible. You see it. The dog\r\ngrowled as if he would have eaten me, because I am a stranger, while he\r\nwas mad with joy when he saw you again, for most assuredly this is not\r\nthe first time he has seen you there.\" Count Poniatowsky treated all\r\nthis as an absurdity on his part, but he could not dissuade him. Count\r\nHorn merely replied, \"Fear nothing; you have to deal with a discreet\r\nperson.\" Next morning they departed. Count Horn used to say, that when\r\nhe went so far as to fall in love, it was always with three women at a\r\ntime. And we had an example of this under our eye at St. Petersburg,\r\nwhere he courted three young ladies at once. Count Poniatowsky left two\r\ndays afterwards for Poland. During his absence the Chevalier Williams\r\nsent me word, through Leon Narichkine, that the High Chancellor\r\nBestoujeff was caballing against the nomination of Count Poniatowsky,\r\nand had, through him, endeavoured to dissuade Count Bruhl, at that time\r\nthe minister and favourite of the King of Poland, from making it. He\r\nadded that he took care not to fulfil this commission, although he had\r\nnot declined it, fearing it might be given to some one else, who would\r\nprobably discharge it more exactly, and thus prejudice his friend, who\r\nwished, above all things, to return to Russia. The Chevalier suspected\r\nthat Count Bestoujeff, who for a long time had the Saxo-Polish ministers\r\nat his disposal, wished to nominate to that post some person\r\nparticularly in his confidence. However, Count Poniatowsky obtained the\r\nappointment, and returned, towards winter, as Envoy of Poland, while the\r\nSaxon embassy remained under the immediate direction of Count\r\nBestoujeff.\r\n\r\nSome time before we quitted Oranienbaum, the Prince and Princess\r\nGalitzine arrived there, accompanied by M. Betzky. They were going to\r\ntravel abroad on account of ill-health, especially Betzky, who needed\r\nsome distraction to relieve the deep melancholy into which he had been\r\nplunged by the death of the Princess of Hesse Homburg--born Princess\r\nTroubetzkoy, mother of the Princess Galitzine, who was the issue of the\r\nfirst marriage of the Princess of Hesse with the Hospodar of Wallachia,\r\nPrince Kantemir. As the Princess Galitzine and Betzky were old\r\nacquaintances, I endeavoured to give them the best reception I could at\r\nOranienbaum, and after having shown them about a good deal, the Princess\r\nGalitzine and I got into a cabriolet, which I guided myself, and we took\r\na drive in the neighbourhood of Oranienbaum. On our way, the Princess,\r\nwho was a very singular and narrow-minded person, gave me to understand\r\nthat she thought I entertained some ill-feeling against her. I assured\r\nher that such was not the case, and that I did not know of anything\r\nwhich could give occasion to any ill-feeling on my part, as I had never\r\nhad any disagreement with her. Thereupon she told me that she had feared\r\nCount Poniatowsky might have injured her in my good opinion. I thought I\r\nshould have dropped at these words. I replied that she must certainly be\r\ndreaming; that the person she spoke of was not in a position to\r\nprejudice her in my opinion; that he had been gone some time; that I\r\nonly knew him by sight, and as a stranger; and that I could not\r\nunderstand what could have put such an idea into her head. Upon my\r\nreturn home, I sent for Leon Narichkine, and related to him this\r\nconversation, which appeared to me as stupid as it was impertinent and\r\nindiscreet. He told me that during last winter the Princess Galitzine\r\nhad moved heaven and earth to attract Count Poniatowsky to her house,\r\nand that he out of politeness, and not to be wanting in respect, had\r\npaid her some attention; that she had made all sort of advances to him,\r\nto which it may easily be believed he did not much respond, as she was\r\nold, ugly, stupid, and foolish--indeed, almost crazy; and that seeing\r\nshe could make no impression on him, her suspicions seemed to have been\r\nexcited by the fact that he was always with him, Narichkine, and at his\r\nsister-in-law's house.\r\n\r\nDuring the brief stay of the Countess Galitzine at Oranienbaum, I had a\r\ndreadful quarrel with the Grand Duke about my maids of honour. I had\r\nobserved that these ladies, who were always either confidantes or\r\nmistresses of the Grand Duke, had on several occasions been neglectful\r\nof their duties, or even failed in the respect and deference which they\r\nowed me. I went one afternoon into their apartment, and reproached them\r\nwith their conduct, reminding them of their duty, of what they owed me,\r\ntelling them if they went on in the same way I should complain to the\r\nEmpress. Some of them were alarmed, others got angry, and some wept; but\r\nas soon as I was gone, they immediately hurried to the Grand Duke, and\r\ntold him what I had said to them. His Imperial Highness got furious, and\r\nimmediately running to my room, exclaimed that there was no living with\r\nme; that every day I became more proud and haughty; that I demanded of\r\nthe maids of honour attentions and deferences which embittered their\r\nlives; that I made them cry all day long; that they were ladies of rank,\r\nwhom I treated like servants; and if I complained of them to the\r\nEmpress, he would complain of me--of my pride, my arrogance, my\r\nill-nature, and God knows what besides. I listened to him, not without\r\nagitation, and replied that he might say of me whatever he pleased; that\r\nif the affair was carried before his aunt, she would be able to judge\r\nwhether it would not be well to dismiss from my service women of bad\r\nconduct, who, by their tittle-tattle, caused dissension between her\r\nnephew and niece; for that if she wished to restore peace between us,\r\nand prevent her ears from being perpetually dinned with our quarrels,\r\nshe could not adopt any other course; and that, consequently, this would\r\ncertainly be the course she would adopt. At this he lowered his tone,\r\nfancying (for he was very suspicious) that I knew more of the intentions\r\nof the Empress with regard to these women than I allowed to appear, and\r\nthat in reality they might all be dismissed for this business. He\r\ntherefore said, \"Tell me, then; do you know anything on this point? Has\r\nany one spoken to her of them?\" I replied that if matters went so far as\r\nto come before the Empress, I had no doubt she would dispose of them in\r\na very summary manner. At this he began walking with hasty strides up\r\nand down my room in a reverie; gradually cooled down; and then went\r\naway, only half-sulky. The same evening, I related this conversation,\r\nword for word, to one of these maids of honour, who appeared to me more\r\nsensible than the rest, and described the scene which their imprudent\r\ntattling had caused. This put them on their guard against carrying\r\nmatters to an extremity, of which, probably, they would become the\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn we returned to town, and shortly afterwards the\r\nChevalier Williams left for England on leave. He had failed in his\r\nobject in Russia. The very next day after his audience of the Empress,\r\nhe had proposed a treaty of alliance between England and Russia. Count\r\nBestoujeff had orders and full authority to conclude this treaty. In\r\nfact, the treaty was signed by him, and the Ambassador could scarcely\r\ncontain his joy at his success, but the following day Count Bestoujeff\r\ncommunicated to him, by note, the accession of Russia to the convention\r\nsigned at Versailles between France and Austria. This was a thunderbolt\r\nfor the English Ambassador, who had been played with and deceived in\r\nthis affair by the High Chancellor, or appeared to have been so. But\r\nCount Bestoujeff himself could no longer do as he pleased; his opponents\r\nwere beginning to get the upper hand of him, and they intrigued, or\r\nrather others were intriguing with them, to gain them over to the\r\nFranco-Austrian party, to which they were already much disposed. The\r\nSchouvaloffs, and especially Ivan Ivanovitch, had a passion for France\r\nand all that belonged to it, and in this they were seconded by the\r\nVice-Chancellor Voronzoff, for whom Louis XV. in return for this piece\r\nof service, furnished the mansion which he had just built at St.\r\nPetersburg, with old furniture which his mistress, Madame Pompadour, had\r\nbecome tired of, and had sold to her lover, the King, at a good price.\r\nBut apart from all considerations of profit, the Vice-Chancellor had\r\nanother motive: he wished to lessen the credit of his rival, Count\r\nBestoujeff, and secure his place for Peter Schouvaloff. Besides, he\r\nmeditated a monopoly of the Russian trade in tobacco, in order to sell\r\nthe article in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1757.\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year, Count Poniatowsky returned to Russia as\r\nminister of the King of Poland. In the early part of the year, the tenor\r\nof our life was the same as in the previous winter; the same balls, the\r\nsame concerts, and the same coteries. Soon after our return to the city,\r\nwhere I could observe things more closely, I perceived that M.\r\nBrockdorf, with his intrigues, was making rapid progress in the good\r\ngraces of the Grand Duke. He was seconded in this by a considerable\r\nnumber of Holstein officers whom he had encouraged his Highness to\r\nretain this winter at St. Petersburg. The number amounted to at least\r\ntwenty, who were continually within the Grand Duke's circle, without\r\ncounting a couple of Holstein soldiers who did duty in his chamber as\r\nmessengers, valets-de-chambre--factotums, in a word. All these were, in\r\nreality, so many spies in the service of Messrs. Brockdorf and Co. I\r\nwatched for a favourable moment during this winter to speak seriously to\r\nthe Grand Duke, and tell him exactly what I thought of those about him,\r\nand of the intrigues which I saw going on. One presented itself, which I\r\ndid not neglect. The Grand Duke himself came one day into my cabinet, to\r\ntell me that it had been represented to him as indispensably necessary\r\nthat he should send secret orders to Holstein for the arrest of a person\r\nnamed Elendsheim, who, by his office and the personal consideration he\r\nenjoyed, was one of the leading men of the country. He was of\r\n_bourgeois_ extraction, but had risen by his learning and capacity to\r\nhis present post. I asked the Duke what complaints were made against\r\nhim, and what he had done to require his arrest. He replied, \"Why, you\r\nsee, they tell me he is suspected of malversation.\" I inquired who were\r\nhis accusers. On this, he thought himself very reasonable in saying,\r\n\"Oh, as for accusers, there are none, for every one in the country fears\r\nand respects him; and it is on this very account that I ought to have\r\nhim arrested, for as soon as this is done, there will be, I am assured,\r\naccusers enough and to spare.\" I shuddered at this answer, and replied,\r\n\"But at this rate there will not be an innocent man in the world; it\r\nwill only be necessary for some envious person to set afloat any vague\r\nrumour he pleases, and then any one whatever may be arrested on the\r\nprinciple that accusations and crimes will come afterwards. It is, to\r\nuse the words of the song, '_à la façon de Barbari, mon ami_,' that\r\nthey are advising you to act, without regard to your reputation or your\r\nsense of justice. Who is it that gives you such bad advice? if I may be\r\nallowed to ask.\" My gentleman looked a little foolish at this question,\r\nand said, \"You are always wanting to know more than other people.\" I\r\nreplied, that it was not for the sake of knowing that I spoke, but\r\nbecause I hated injustice, and could not believe that he wished to\r\ncommit such a wrong out of mere wantonness. Upon this he began to pace\r\nup and down the room with hasty strides, and then went away more\r\nagitated than displeased. A little while afterwards he came back,\r\nsaying, \"Come to my room, Brockdorf will talk to you about the affair of\r\nElendsheim, and you will see and be convinced that I must have him\r\narrested.\" I replied, \"Very well, I will follow you, and will hear what\r\nhe has to say, since you wish it.\" I did so, and as soon as we entered,\r\nthe Grand Duke said to Brockdorf, \"Speak to the Grand Duchess.\"\r\nBrockdorf, a little confused, bowed to the Duke, and said, \"Since your\r\nHighness commands me, I will speak to her Imperial Highness the Grand\r\nDuchess.\" Here he paused, and then said, \"This is an affair which\r\nrequires to be managed with much secrecy and prudence.\" I listened. \"All\r\nHolstein is full of rumours of the malversations and extortions of\r\nElendsheim. It is true he has no accusers, for he is feared; but when he\r\nis arrested, there will be no difficulty in getting as many as may be\r\nwished.\" I asked for some details of these malversations and extortions,\r\nand learnt that as for embezzlement of the revenue, there could not be\r\nany, since the Grand Duke had no money in hand there; but what was\r\nlooked upon as malversation was, that being at the head of the\r\nadministration of justice, whenever any cause was to be tried, there was\r\nalways some pleader or other who complained of injustice, and accused\r\nthe opposite party of having gained their cause by bribing the judges.\r\nBut M. Brockdorf displayed his eloquence and skill in vain; he did not\r\nconvince me. I still maintained to him, in presence of the Grand Duke,\r\nthat they were pushing on his Imperial Highness to commit an act of\r\ncrying injustice, by persuading him to despatch an order for the arrest\r\nof a man against whom there existed no formal complaint or accusation. I\r\nsaid to M. Brockdorf that after that fashion the Grand Duke might have\r\nhim locked up at any hour, and say that the crimes and accusations would\r\ncome afterwards; and that, as to lawsuits, it was easy to conceive that\r\nhe who lost his cause would always complain of having been wronged. I\r\nadded, too, that the Grand Duke, more than any other person, ought to be\r\non his guard against such things, as experience had already taught him,\r\nto his cost, what persecution and party-spirit could do; for it was not\r\nmore than two or three years, at the utmost, since his Imperial\r\nHighness, at my intercession, had ordered the release of M. de Holmer,\r\nwho had been kept in prison for six or eight years, in order to compel\r\nhim to give an account of affairs transacted during the Grand Duke's\r\nminority, and under the administration of his guardian, the Prince Royal\r\nof Sweden, to whom M. de Holmer had been attached, and whom he followed\r\nto Sweden; whence he did not return until the Grand Duke had signed and\r\nsent him a testimonial of approval, and a formal discharge for all that\r\nhad been done during his minority. And yet in spite of all this, the\r\nGrand Duke had been induced to have M. de Holmer arrested, and a\r\ncommission of inquiry appointed, to examine into things which occurred\r\nunder the administration of the Prince Royal of Sweden. This\r\ncommission, after acting at first with much vigour, and offering a\r\nclear stage to all informers, had, nevertheless, been able to discover\r\nnothing, and had fallen into lethargy for want of aliment. Yet all this\r\ntime, M. de Holmer languished in close confinement, being allowed to see\r\nneither wife, nor children, nor friends, nor relatives; until at last\r\nthe whole country cried out against the injustice and tyranny of this\r\nbusiness, which was in truth outrageous, and which would not even then\r\nhave been so soon brought to an end had I not advised the Grand Duke to\r\ncut this Gordian knot by despatching an order for the release of M. de\r\nHolmer, and the abolition of the commission, which, besides, cost no\r\ntrifling sum to the already nearly exhausted exchequer of the Grand\r\nDuke's hereditary duchy. But it was to no purpose that I quoted this\r\nstriking example; the Grand Duke listened to me, thinking all the while,\r\nI fancy, of something else, while M. Brockdorf, hardened in wickedness,\r\nnarrow in mind, and obstinate as a block, allowed me to talk on, having\r\nno more reasons to produce. And when I was gone away, he told the Grand\r\nDuke that all I had urged sprung from no other motive than the desire of\r\nruling; that I disapproved of every measure which I had not myself\r\nadvised; that I knew nothing of business; that women always liked to be\r\nmeddling in everything, and always spoilt whatever they did meddle with;\r\nand that all vigorous measures especially were beyond their capacity; in\r\nshort, he managed to overrule my advice, and the Grand Duke, at his\r\npersuasion, had an order for the arrest of Elendsheim drawn up, signed,\r\nand immediately despatched. A person of the name of Zeitz, secretary to\r\nthe Grand Duke, who was in the interest of Pechlin, and was son-in-law\r\nof the midwife who attended me, informed me of all this. The party of\r\nPechlin, generally, disapproved of this violent and unreasonable\r\nmeasure, with which M. Brockdorf alarmed both them and the whole country\r\nof Holstein. As soon as I learnt that the wiles of M. Brockdorf had\r\nprevailed over my advice and earnest representations, in a case of such\r\ncrying injustice, I resolved to make M. Brockdorf feel my indignation to\r\nthe utmost. I told Zeitz, and I had Pechlin informed, that from that\r\nmoment I regarded M. Brockdorf as a pest, to be shunned and driven away\r\nfrom the Grand Duke, if it could in any manner be accomplished; as for\r\nmyself, I would employ every means in my power for that end. And, in\r\nfact, I made it a point to manifest, on every occasion, the disgust and\r\nthe horror with which the conduct of this man had inspired me. There was\r\nno sort of ridicule with which he was not covered, and I did not allow\r\nany one, whenever an occasion offered, to remain ignorant of what I\r\nthought of him. Leon Narichkine, and other young people, amused\r\nthemselves in seconding me in this. Whenever M. Brockdorf passed through\r\nthe apartments, everyone cried out after him, Pelican--such was the\r\nnickname we had given him. This bird was the most hideous that we knew\r\nof, and as a man, M. Brockdorf was quite as hideous, both externally and\r\ninternally. He was tall, with a long neck, and a broad, flat head, and\r\nwithal red-haired. He wore a wire wig; his eyes were small, dull and\r\nsunk in his head, and almost destitute of eyelashes and eyebrows, while\r\nthe corners of his month hung down towards his chin, giving him a\r\nmiserable as well as an evil look. As to his character I may refer to\r\nwhat I have just said; but I will further add that he was so corrupt\r\nthat he took money from all who were willing to give it him, and in\r\norder that his august master might not at some future time be able to\r\nblame these extortions, and seeing him always in need of money, he\r\npersuaded him to do the same, and in this way he procured him all he\r\ncould, as well by selling Holstein orders and titles to any one who\r\nwould pay for them, as by inducing him to solicit, and intrigue for, in\r\nthe different bureaux of the empire, as well as in the senate, all sorts\r\nof things, many of them unjust, some even burdensome to the state, such\r\nas monopolies and other privileges which could not otherwise be allowed,\r\nsince they were contrary to the laws of Peter I. Besides this, M.\r\nBrockdorf led the Duke more than ever into drink and debauchery, having\r\nsurrounded him with a mob of adventurers, drawn from the barracks and\r\ntaverns, both of Germany and St. Petersburg, who had neither faith nor\r\nprinciple, and did nothing but drink, eat, smoke, and talk disgusting\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\nAs I saw that, in spite of all I did and said to lessen the credit of M.\r\nBrockdorf, he still maintained his position in the good opinion of the\r\nGrand Duke, and was even more in favour than ever, I formed the\r\nresolution of telling Count Schouvaloff what I thought of the man,\r\nadding, that I looked upon him as one of the most dangerous persons it\r\nwas possible to have near a young prince, heir to a great empire, and\r\nthat I felt myself in conscience bound to speak to him in confidence, in\r\norder that he might inform the Empress, or take what other measures he\r\nmight deem proper. He asked whether he might venture to mention my name.\r\nI told him he might, and that if the Empress asked me about it I would\r\nnot mince the matter, but tell her what I knew and saw. Count Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff winked his eye as he listened to me very seriously, but he\r\nwas not a person to act without the advice of his brother Peter and his\r\ncousin Ivan. For a long time I heard nothing; at last he gave me to\r\nunderstand that the Empress might speak to me on the subject. In the\r\ninterim, the Grand Duke bounced into my room one day, closely followed\r\nby his secretary Zeitz, with a paper in his hand. The Duke, addressing\r\nme, said, \"Just look at this devil of a fellow! I drank too much\r\nyesterday, and to-day my brain is still in a whirl, and he brings me a\r\nwhole sheet of paper, which, after all, is only a list of the matters\r\nwhich he wishes me to finish; he follows me even into your room.\" Zeitz\r\nsaid to me, \"All that I have got here only requires a yes or a no, and\r\nwill not take up a quarter of an hour.\" \"Well, let us see,\" I said,\r\n\"perhaps you will get through them easier than you think.\" Zeitz began\r\nto read, and as he read on, I answered, 'yes' or 'no.' This pleased the\r\nGrand Duke, and Zeitz said to him, \"Look, my Lord, if you would only\r\nconsent to do thus twice a week, your affairs would not fall into\r\narrear. These things are but trifles, but they must be attended to, and\r\nthe Grand Duchess has finished the matter with six times 'yes,' and as\r\nmany times 'no.'\" Thenceforward his Imperial Highness used to send Zeitz\r\nto me whenever he had any \"yeses\" or \"noes.\" After a time, I asked him\r\nto give me a written order, stating what things I might settle, and what\r\nI must not determine without his express direction, and this he did.\r\nNone but Pechlin, Zeitz, and myself were cognizant of this arrangement,\r\nwith which Pechlin and Zeitz were delighted. When a signature was\r\nnecessary, the Grand Duke signed what I had settled. The affair of\r\nElendsheim remained under the care of Brockdorf; but when once\r\nElendsheim was under arrest, M. Brockdorf was in no hurry to push the\r\nbusiness, for he had thus gained pretty nearly all he wanted, which was\r\nto remove Elendsheim from public affairs, and to manifest in Holstein\r\nhis own influence with his master.\r\n\r\nI seized, one day, a favourable opportunity for saying to the Grand\r\nDuke, that since he found the affairs of Holstein so troublesome to\r\nregulate, and regarded them as a sample of what he would have one day to\r\nsettle when the Empire of Russia fell to his lot, I thought he must look\r\nforward to that charge as something more oppressive still; thereupon he\r\nrepeated what he had often said to me before--that he felt he was not\r\nborn for Russia; that he did not suit the Russians nor the Russians him;\r\nand that he was persuaded he should perish in Russia. On this point I\r\nsaid to him what I had also said to him many a time before, that he\r\nought not to allow himself to give way to so fatal an idea, but to do\r\nhis best to make himself liked by every one in Russia, and to ask the\r\nEmpress to allow him an opportunity of making himself acquainted with\r\nthe affairs of the empire. I induced him even to ask permission to be\r\npresent at the conferences which served as a council for the Empress. In\r\nfact, he did speak of this to the Schouvaloffs, who induced the Empress\r\nto admit him to these conferences whenever she was present at them\r\nherself. This was pretty nearly the same thing as settling that he\r\nshould never be admitted, for after going with him once or twice,\r\nneither of them again attended.\r\n\r\nThe advice which I gave to the Grand Duke was, in general, good and\r\nsalutary; but he who gives counsel can only do so in accordance with his\r\nown cast of mind and turn of thought--his own mode of action and manner\r\nof viewing things. But the great object of my counsels to the Grand Duke\r\nconsisted in the fact that his way of doing things was quite different\r\nfrom mine, and the more we advanced in years the more marked did this\r\ndifference become. I made it a point, in all things, to keep as close to\r\ntruth as I possibly could, while he receded from it farther and farther\r\nevery day, until at last he became a determined liar. As the way in\r\nwhich he became so is rather singular, I will state it, as it may\r\nperhaps display the course of the human mind on this point, and so be\r\nuseful in showing how this vice may be prevented or corrected in those\r\nwho may evince a tendency towards it. The first falsehood invented by\r\nthe Grand Duke was told with a view of giving himself consequence in the\r\neyes of some young married woman or girl, on whose ignorance he could\r\ncount. He would tell her how, while still living with his father in\r\nHolstein, his father had put him at the head of a detachment of his\r\nguards and had sent him to seize a troop of gipsies who were prowling\r\nabout Kiel and committing, he said, frightful robberies. These he would\r\nrelate in detail, as also the several stratagems he had made use of to\r\nsurround them and to engage them in one or many battles, in which he\r\npretended to have performed prodigies of skill and valour, after which\r\nhe had taken them prisoners and carried them to Kiel. At first he took\r\ncare not to tell all this to any one but those who were ignorant of his\r\nhistory. By degrees he grew bold enough to produce his composition\r\nbefore those on whose discretion he could so far rely as not to fear a\r\ncontradiction from them; but when he ventured to relate this story to\r\nme, I asked him how long before his father's death it had taken place.\r\nHe replied, without hesitation, \"Three or four years.\" \"Well,\" I said,\r\n\"you began very young to show your prowess; for, three or four years\r\nbefore your father's death, you were not more than six or seven years\r\nold, having been left, at the age of eleven, under the guardianship of\r\nmy uncle, the Prince Royal of Sweden. And what equally astonishes me,\" I\r\nobserved, \"is that your father, of whom you were the only son, and one\r\ntoo whose health, according to what I have been told, was always\r\ndelicate at that period, should have sent you to fight against brigands,\r\nand that too at the early age of six or seven.\" The Grand Duke became\r\nterribly angry at these remarks, saying that I disbelieved him and\r\nwished to represent him as a liar in the eyes of the world. I told him\r\nit was not I, but the almanac who threw discredit on his story; and that\r\nI left it to himself to judge whether it was possible, in the nature of\r\nthings, that a child of six or seven, an only son, the heir-apparent of\r\na principality, and the only hope of his father, should be sent to catch\r\ngipsies. He held his tongue, and I too; but he sulked with me for a long\r\nwhile. When, however, he had forgotten my remonstrances, he still\r\ncontinued to relate, even in my presence, this story, of which he gave\r\nendless variations. He afterwards made up another far more disgraceful,\r\nas well as more injurious to himself, which I will relate in its proper\r\nplace. It would be impossible for me at present to tell all the dreams\r\nwhich he occasionally imagined and gave out as facts, but in which there\r\nwas not a shadow of truth. The illustration I have given, will, I think,\r\nbe sufficient for the present. One Thursday, towards the end of the\r\nCarnival, there being a ball in our apartments, I was sitting between\r\nthe sister-in-law of Leon Narichkine and his sister, Madame Siniavine,\r\nand we were looking at Marine Ossipovna Sakrefskaïa, Maid of Honour to\r\nthe Empress and niece of the Count Rasoumowsky, who was dancing a\r\nminuet. She was at this time slight and active, and it was said that\r\nCount Horn was very much in love with her. But as he was always in love\r\nwith three women at a time, he also paid his addresses to the Countess\r\nMarie Romanovna Voronzoff and to Anne Alexievna Hitroff, who were\r\nlikewise Maids of Honour to her Imperial Majesty. We thought that the\r\nfirst-mentioned danced well, and that she was rather pretty. She was\r\ndancing with Leon Narichkine. While talking on this subject, his\r\nsister-in-law and sister told me that his mother talked of marrying him\r\nto Mademoiselle Hitroff, a niece of the Schouvaloffs, on the side of her\r\nmother, who was the sister of Peter and Alexander Schouvaloff, and\r\nmarried to the father of Mademoiselle Hitroff. This gentleman was often\r\nat the Narichkines, and had so managed that Leon's mother had conceived\r\nthe idea of this marriage. Neither Madame Siniavine nor his\r\nsister-in-law were at all anxious for a connection with the\r\nSchouvaloffs, whom, as I have already said, they did not at all like,\r\nand as for Leon, he was not even aware that his mother was thinking of\r\nmarrying him, while he was actually in love with the Countess Marie\r\nVoronzoff just spoken of. On hearing this, I told Mesdames Siniavine and\r\nNarichkine that we must not permit this marriage with Mademoiselle\r\nHitroff, who was a person very much disliked, was intriguing,\r\ndisagreeable, and boisterous, and that, to cut short all such ideas, we\r\nought to give Leon a wife of our own sort. For this purpose I suggested\r\nthe above-named niece of the Count Rasoumowsky, a lady of whom, besides,\r\nthey were both very fond, and who was always at their house. My two\r\nfriends greatly approved of my advice, and next day, as there was a\r\nmasquerade at court, I addressed myself to Marshal Rasoumowsky, who was\r\nat that time Hetman of the Ukraine, and told him in plain terms that he\r\nwas doing very wrong to allow his niece to lose such a desirable husband\r\nas Leon Narichkine; that his mother wished him to marry Mademoiselle\r\nHitroff, but that Madame Siniavine, his sister-in-law, and myself, were\r\nagreed that his niece would be a more suitable person; and that\r\ntherefore he ought, without loss of time, to make the proposal to the\r\nparties interested. The Marshal relished our project, spoke of it to his\r\nthen factotum, Teploff, who at once went and spoke of it to the elder\r\nCount Rasoumowsky, who also gave his consent. The very next morning\r\nTeploff went to the Bishop of St. Petersburg, and purchased for fifty\r\nroubles the necessary dispensation. This being obtained, the Marshal and\r\nhis wife went to their aunt, the mother of Leon, and managed so well\r\nthat they gained her consent even against her own wishes. They were but\r\njust in time, for that very day she was to give her decision to M.\r\nHitroff. This being done, Marshal Rasoumowsky, Mesdames Siniavine and\r\nNarichkine, broke the matter to Leon, and persuaded him to marry one of\r\nwhom he had not even had a thought, while he was actually in love with\r\nanother. She, however, was as good as promised to Count Boutourline. As\r\nfor Madame Hitroff, he did not care for her at all. This consent being\r\ngained, the Marshal sent for his niece, and she felt that the match was\r\ntoo good to be refused. The next day, which was Sunday, the two Counts\r\nRasoumowsky asked the Empress' consent to the match, which she gave at\r\nonce. The Schouvaloffs were astonished at the manner in which M. Hitroff\r\nand themselves also had been outwitted, for it was not until the consent\r\nof the Empress had been obtained that they even heard of the matter.\r\nHowever, the affair being settled, there was no help for it, and thus\r\nLeon, in love with one woman, and his mother wishing him to marry\r\nanother, married a third, of whom neither he nor any one else had\r\nthought three days before. This marriage of Leon Narichkine united me\r\nstill more closely than ever in friendship with the Counts Rasoumowsky,\r\nwho were really grateful to me for having procured so excellent and so\r\nhigh a match for their niece, nor were they at all sorry at having got\r\nthe better of the Schouvaloffs, who could not even complain, but were\r\nobliged to conceal their mortification. It was, moreover, an additional\r\ndistinction which I had thus procured for them.\r\n\r\nThe amours of the Grand Duke with Madame Teploff were now in rather a\r\nlanguishing condition. One of the greatest obstacles in their way was\r\nthe difficulty of seeing one another, and this vexed his Imperial\r\nHighness, who was no fonder of difficulties than he was of answering\r\nletters. At the end of the Carnival, his amours began to be a matter of\r\nparty. The Princess of Courland informed me one day that Count Roman\r\nVoronzoff, the father of the two young ladies who were at the court, and\r\nwho by the way was the horror of the Grand Duke, as were also his five\r\nchildren, was in the habit of speaking of the Grand Duke with very\r\nlittle respect or reserve.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, he said that if he thought proper he could easily\r\nconvert the Duke's antipathy into favour, it being only necessary to\r\ngive a dinner to Brockdorf, let him have plenty of English beer to\r\ndrink, and when going away, put six bottles of it into his pocket for\r\nhis Imperial Highness, and then he and his youngest daughter would at\r\nonce take the highest places in the Grand Duke's favour. At the ball the\r\nsame evening, I observed a good deal of whispering between his Imperial\r\nHighness and the Countess Marie Voronzoff, the eldest daughter of Count\r\nRoman, for this family had really become very intimate with the\r\nSchouvaloffs, with whom Brockdorf was always welcome. It would have\r\ngiven me anything but pleasure to have seen Mademoiselle Elizabeth\r\nVoronzoff come again into favour, and therefore, to put an additional\r\nobstacle in the way, I told the Grand Duke what the father had said,\r\nand what I have just related. He became almost furious, and demanded in\r\ngreat anger from whom I had heard this. For a long while I was unwilling\r\nto tell him, but he said that as I could not name any one, he should\r\nbelieve that I had myself made up this story in order to damage the\r\ncharacter of both the father and daughters. It was in vain that I told\r\nhim I had never in my life made up any such tale; I was obliged at last\r\nto name the Princess of Courland. He told me that he should instantly\r\nwrite her a note to London whether I had spoken the truth, and that\r\nshould there be the least variation between our accounts, he would\r\ncomplain to the Empress of my intrigues and lies; and with these remarks\r\nhe left the room. Fearing that the answer of the Princess might be in\r\nsome degree equivocal, I wrote her a note saying, \"In Heaven's name,\r\ntell the truth purely and simply on the matter which you are going to be\r\nasked about.\" My note was instantly despatched, and reached her in time,\r\nfor it got before the Grand Duke's. The Princess of Courland gave a\r\ntruthful answer to his Imperial Highness, and he found that I had not\r\ntold him a falsehood. This withheld him for some time from his\r\n\"liaisons\" with these two daughters of a man who had but little esteem\r\nfor him, and whom besides he himself disliked. But in order to put an\r\nadditional obstacle in the way, Leon Narichkine persuaded Count\r\nRasoumowsky to invite the Duke to his house one or two evenings each\r\nweek, quite in private. It was almost a _partie quarrée_, for no one was\r\npresent at it but the Marshal, Marie Paolovna Narichkine, the Grand\r\nDuke, Madame Teploff, and Leon Narichkine. This went on for a good part\r\nof Lent, and gave rise to another idea. The Marshal's house was at this\r\ntime of wood. He received company in his wife's apartments, and as they\r\nwere both fond of play, there was always play there. The Marshal used to\r\ngo backwards and forwards, and in his private apartments he had his own\r\ncoterie, when the Grand Duke was not there. But as the Marshal had often\r\nbeen at my rooms in my little furtive parties, he wished our caterer to\r\ncome in turn to his home. With this view, what he called his hermitage,\r\nwhich consisted of two or three rooms on the ground-floor, was destined\r\nfor us. Every one was carefully concealed, because, as I have already\r\nsaid, we dared not go out without permission. By this arrangement there\r\nwere three or four parties in the house; the Marshal went from one to\r\nthe other, and mine was the only one that knew all that was going on in\r\nthe house, whereas none knew that we were there.\r\n\r\nTowards the spring M. Pechlin, minister of the Grand Duke for Holstein,\r\ndied. The Grand Chancellor, Count Bestoujeff, foreseeing his death, had\r\nadvised me to ask the Grand Duke to give the place to a certain M.\r\nStambke. At the commencement of spring we went to Oranienbaum. Here our\r\nmode of life was the same as in previous years, with this exception,\r\nthat the number of Holstein troops, and of adventurers who were\r\nappointed as officers over them, was augmented year by year; and as it\r\nwas impossible to find quarters for them in the little village of\r\nOranienbaum, where at the first there were no more than twenty-eight\r\ncottages, tents were pitched for these troops, whose number never\r\nexceeded 1300 men. The officers dined and supped at court; but as the\r\nnumber of ladies belonging to the court, together with the wives of the\r\ngentlemen, did not exceed fifteen or sixteen, and as his Imperial\r\nHighness was passionately fond of grand entertainments, which he\r\nfrequently gave, both in his camp, and in every nook and corner of\r\nOranienbaum, he admitted to these entertainments, not only the female\r\nsingers and ballet-girls of his opera, but also a great many women of\r\nthe middle class, of very bad character, who were brought to him from\r\nSt. Petersburg. As soon as I was aware that these singing women, etc.,\r\nwere to be admitted, I abstained from attending, under pretext at first\r\nthat I was taking the waters, and the greater part of the time I took my\r\nmeals in my own rooms with two or three persons. I afterwards told the\r\nGrand Duke that I was afraid the Empress would be displeased if I\r\nappeared in so mixed a company; and, in fact, I never went when I knew\r\nthat the hospitality was general, and therefore, whenever the Grand Duke\r\nwished me to come, none were admitted but the ladies of the court. At\r\nthe masquerades which the Grand Duke gave at Oranienbaum, I never\r\nappeared otherwise than very simply dressed, without jewels or\r\nornaments. This, too, had a good effect with the Empress, who neither\r\nliked nor approved of these _fêtes_ at Oranienbaum, which really became\r\norgies; and yet she tolerated them, or at least did not forbid them. I\r\nwas informed that her Imperial Highness said, \"These _fêtes_ give no\r\nmore pleasure to the Grand Duchess than they do to me; she goes to them\r\ndressed in the simplest manner possible, and never sups with the crowd\r\nadmitted to them.\" I occupied myself at this time at Oranienbaum in\r\nbuilding and planting what is there called my garden, and the rest of\r\nthe time I took exercise either in walking, riding, or driving, and in\r\nmy own room I read.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July we heard that Memel had surrendered on terms to the\r\nRussian troops on the 24th of June, and in August the news arrived of\r\nthe Battle of Gross-Jægersdorf, won by the Russian army on the 19th of\r\nthat month. On the day of the _Te Deum_, I gave a grand entertainment in\r\nmy garden to the Grand Duke, and to all the most distinguished people at\r\nOranienbaum, at which the Grand Duke and all the company appeared very\r\ngay, and very much pleased. This diminished for the moment the pain\r\nwhich the Grand Duke felt at the war which had just broken out between\r\nRussia and the King of Prussia, for which ever since his boyhood he had\r\nfelt a singular inclination. This at the first was natural enough, but\r\nin the end it degenerated into madness. At this time the public joy at\r\nthe success of the arms of Russia obliged him to dissemble his real\r\nsentiments, which were that he saw with regret the defeat of the\r\nPrussian troops, which he regarded as invincible. On that day I had an\r\nox roasted for the masons and laborers at Oranienbaum.\r\n\r\nA few days after this entertainment we returned to the capital, where we\r\noccupied the Summer Palace. Here Count Alexander Schouvaloff came one\r\nevening to tell me that the Empress was in his wife's room, and that she\r\nhad sent word to me to come there and speak to her, as I had desired\r\nlast winter. I went without delay to the apartment of the Count and\r\nCountess Schouvaloff, which was at the end of my own apartments, and\r\nfound the Empress there quite alone. After kissing her hand and\r\nreceiving her embrace in return, she did me the honour to say, that\r\nhaving been informed that I wanted to speak to her, she had come to-day\r\nto know what it was I wanted. It was now eight months and more since my\r\nconversation with Alexander Schouvaloff on the subject of Brockdorf. I\r\nreplied to her Imperial Majesty that last winter, seeing the way in\r\nwhich M. Brockdorf acted, I had thought it necessary to speak of it to\r\nCount Alexander Schouvaloff, in order that he might apprise her Imperial\r\nMajesty of it; that he had asked if he might name me as his authority,\r\nand that I had told him that, if her Imperial Majesty wished it, I would\r\nrepeat to her all that I knew. Thereupon I related the story of\r\nElendsheim as it had taken place. She seemed to listen to me very\r\ncoldly, then she asked me for details of the private life of the Grand\r\nDuke and of his associates. I told her with the greatest truth all that\r\nI knew of them, and when, with regard to the affairs of Holstein, I\r\nentered into some details which showed her that I was well acquainted\r\nwith them, she said to me, \"You seem to be well informed in regard to\r\nthat country.\" I said very simply that that was not a difficulty, as the\r\nGrand Duke had ordered me to make myself acquainted with them. I saw\r\nfrom her countenance that this confidence made a disagreeable impression\r\non her mind, and generally she appeared to me unusually close during\r\nthis conversation, in which she questioned me, and made me talk,\r\nscarcely saying a word herself, so that this interview appeared to me\r\nrather a kind of inquisition on her part, than a confidential\r\nconversation. At last she dismissed me quite as coldly as she received\r\nme, and I was very little pleased with my audience, which Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff recommended me to keep quite secret, which I promised him to\r\ndo, and indeed there was nothing in it to boast of. On my return I\r\nattributed the coldness of the Empress to the antipathy with which, as I\r\nhad long been informed, the Schouvaloffs had inspired her against me. It\r\nwill be seen as we proceed what a detestable use, if I may venture to\r\nsay so, they persuaded her to make of the private conversation.\r\n\r\nSome time after this we learned that Marshal Apraxine, far from\r\nprofiting by his success after the capture of Memel and the victory of\r\nGross-Jægersdorf, to push onwards, was retiring with such\r\nprecipitation, that his retreat resembled a flight, for he threw away or\r\nburned his carriages and spiked his guns. No one understood these\r\noperations: his friends, even, could not justify him, and on that\r\naccount it was suspected that there must be some foul play. Although I\r\ndo not myself know to what exactly to attribute the precipitate and\r\ninconsistent retreat of Marshal Apraxine, never having seen him since,\r\nyet I think the cause of it may have been that he received from his\r\ndaughter, the Princess Kourakine, always connected by policy, though not\r\nby inclination, with Peter Schouvaloff, from his son-in-law, Prince\r\nKourakine, and from his friends and relatives, very precise news of the\r\nhealth of the Empress, which was constantly getting worse and worse. At\r\nthis time it began generally to be conceived that she had very violent\r\nconvulsions every month, regularly; that these convulsions visibly\r\nenfeebled her faculties; that after every convulsion she was for three\r\nor four days in a state of weakness and exhaustion which resembled\r\nlethargy; and that during this period she could not be spoken to on any\r\nsubject whatsoever. Marshal Apraxine, perhaps thinking the danger more\r\nurgent than it really was, did not judge it advisable to advance farther\r\ninto Prussia, but thought it best to make a retrograde movement, in\r\norder to draw nearer to the frontiers of Russia, under pretext of want\r\nof provisions, foreseeing that, in the event of the Empress' death, the\r\nwar would be brought at once to a close. It was difficult to justify the\r\nproceedings of Marshal Apraxine. But such may have been his views, and\r\nthe more so as he believed his presence necessary in Russia, as I have\r\nalready mentioned, when speaking of his departure. Count Bestoujeff\r\ninformed me, through Stambke, of the turn which the conduct of Marshal\r\nApraxine had taken, and how the Imperial Ambassador, and that of\r\nFrance, loudly complained of it. He begged me to write to the Marshal,\r\nas being his friend, and join my persuasions to his, to induce him to\r\nretrace his steps and put an end to a flight to which his enemies gave\r\nan odious and injurious interpretation. I did write to him, and informed\r\nhim of the reports current at St. Petersburg, and of the difficulty\r\nwhich his friends found in justifying the precipitancy of his retreat,\r\nand begged him to retrace his steps and fulfil the orders he had\r\nreceived from the Government. This letter was sent to him through\r\nBestoujeff, but I received no reply to it. Meanwhile General Fermor,\r\nDirector-General of Works to her Imperial Majesty, came to take leave of\r\nus on his departure from St. Petersburg. We learned that he was\r\nappointed to the army. He had formerly been Quarter-master-general to\r\nCount Munich. The first thing which he asked for was to have with him\r\nhis _employés_ or superintendents, at the board of works, the Brigadiers\r\nReaznoff and Mordvinoff; and with them he set off for the army. These\r\nwere soldiers who had scarcely ever done anything but make contracts for\r\nbuilding. On his arrival he was ordered to take the command, in place of\r\nMarshal Apraxine, who was recalled, and who, on his return, found at\r\nTrihorsky an order to await there the commands of the Empress. These\r\nwere long in reaching him, because his friends, his daughter, and Peter\r\nSchouvaloff moved heaven and earth to calm the anger of the Empress,\r\nfomented as it was by Counts Voronzoff, Boutourline, John Schouvaloff,\r\nand others, who were urged on by the ambassadors of the courts of Vienna\r\nand Versailles, who were anxious to have the Marshal brought to trial.\r\nAt last, commissioners were named to examine him. After the first\r\ninterrogatory, the Marshal was seized with a fit of apoplexy, of which\r\nhe died in about twenty-four hours. In this trial, General Lieven would\r\nassuredly have also been included. He was the friend and confidant of\r\nApraxine. I should have had an additional grief, for Lieven was\r\nsincerely attached to me. But whatever friendship I may have had for\r\nApraxine and Lieven, I can swear that I was entirely ignorant of the\r\ncause of their conduct, and even of their conduct itself, although a\r\ngood deal of trouble was taken to circulate a report that it was to\r\nplease the Grand Duke and me that they had retreated instead of\r\nadvancing. Lieven occasionally gave very singular proofs of his\r\nattachment to me; among others, the following. The Ambassador of\r\nAustria, Count Esterhazy, gave a masquerade, at which the Empress and\r\nall the court were present. Lieven, seeing me pass the room where he\r\nwas, said to his neighbour, who was Count Poniatowsky, \"There is a woman\r\nfor whom a fellow might take some blows of the knout without\r\ncomplaining.\" I have this anecdote from Count Poniatowsky himself, since\r\nKing of Poland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as General Fermor had assumed the command, he hastened to fulfil\r\nhis instructions, which were precise. He instantly moved forward, in\r\nspite of the rigour of the season, and occupied Königsberg, which sent\r\ndeputies to him on 18th January, 1758.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter I suddenly perceived a great change in the behaviour\r\nof Leon Narichkine. He began to be disrespectful and rude; no longer\r\nvisited me except unwillingly, and talked in a manner which made it\r\nevident that some one was filling his head with prejudices against me,\r\nhis sister-in-law, his sister, Count Poniatowsky, and all who held to\r\nme. I learned that he was constantly at the house of John Schouvaloff,\r\nand I easily guessed that they were turning him against me, in order to\r\npunish me for having prevented his marriage with Mademoiselle Hitroff,\r\nand that they would certainly go on until they had led him into\r\nindiscretions which might be injurious to me. His sister-in-law, his\r\nsister, and his brother were equally angry with him on my account, and,\r\nliterally, he conducted himself like a fool, and took delight in\r\noffending us as much as he could, and that, too, while I was furnishing,\r\nat my own expense, the house in which he was to live when married. Every\r\none accused him of ingratitude, and told him that he had no interest in\r\nwhat he was doing; in a word, that he had nothing whatever to complain\r\nof. It was evident that he was a mere tool in the hands of those who had\r\ngot possession of him. He was more regular in paying court to the Grand\r\nDuke, whom he amused as much as he could, leading him on more and more\r\nto courses which he knew I disapproved of. He sometimes pushed his\r\nincivility so far as not to reply when I spoke to him. To this very hour\r\nI cannot conceive what could have offended him, for I had literally\r\nloaded him with favours and friendship, as also all his family, from the\r\nfirst moment I knew them. I fancy he was also induced to cajole the\r\nGrand Duke, by the advice of the Schouvaloffs, who told him that the\r\nDuke's favour would be more advantageous than mine, since I was in ill\r\nodour both with him and the Empress, neither of whom liked me, and that\r\nhe would interfere with his own prospects if he did not detach himself\r\nfrom me; that as soon as the Empress died, the Grand Duke would put me\r\ninto a convent; and other such like statements which the Schouvaloffs\r\nmade to him, and which were reported to me. Besides, they showed him in\r\nperspective the order of St. Anne as the symbol of the Grand Duke's\r\nfavour. By these and such like reasonings and promises, they obtained\r\nfrom this weak-minded young man, all the little treacheries they\r\nwished; indeed, they made him go not only as far, but even farther than\r\nthey wished, although now and then, as will hereafter be seen, he had\r\nhis fits of repentance. He also endeavoured, as much as possible, to\r\nalienate the Grand Duke from me, so that his Imperial Highness\r\nmanifested an almost continuous ill-humour towards me, while he again\r\nrenewed his connection with the Countess Elizabeth Voronzoff.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the spring of this year it was rumoured that Prince\r\nCharles of Saxony, son of Augustus III, King of Poland, intended to\r\nvisit St. Petersburg. The prospect of this visit appeared no pleasure to\r\nthe Grand Duke, for many reasons. In the first place, he feared that it\r\nwould be an additional restraint upon him, as he did not like that the\r\ncourse of life which he had traced out for himself should be in the\r\nleast disturbed. In the next place the house of Saxony stood opposed to\r\nthe King of Prussia, while a third reason may have been that he feared\r\nto suffer by comparison; if so, this, at all events, was being very\r\nmodest, for the poor Prince of Saxony was a mere nonentity and wholly\r\ndevoid of education. Except hunting and dancing, he knew absolutely\r\nnothing, and he told me himself that in the whole course of his life he\r\nnever had a book in his hand except the prayer-books given to him by his\r\nmother, who was a great bigot. The Prince, in short, arrived at St.\r\nPetersburg on the 5th of April, in this year. He was received with much\r\nceremony, and a great display of magnificence and splendour. His suite\r\nwas very numerous, and he was accompanied by many Poles and Saxons,\r\namong whom there was a Lubomirsky, a Pototsky, a Rzevusky, who enjoyed\r\nthe appellation of \"_the handsome_,\" two princes, Soulkowsky, a Count\r\nSapieha, the Count Branitsky, since Grand-General, a Count Einsiedel,\r\nand many others, whose names do not now occur to me. He had a kind of\r\nsub-governor or tutor with him, named Lachinal, who directed his conduct\r\nand his correspondence. The Prince took up his residence in the house of\r\nthe chamberlain, John Schouvaloff, which was recently finished, and on\r\nwhich its owner had exhausted his taste, notwithstanding which the house\r\nwas tasteless and inconveniently though richly furnished. There were\r\nnumerous paintings, but the greater part were only copies. One of the\r\nrooms was ornamented with tchinar wood, but as this wood does not take a\r\npolish it had been varnished; this turned it yellow, but of a very\r\ndisagreeable hue, and, this being pronounced ugly, they sought to remedy\r\nit by covering it with very elaborate carvings, which they silvered.\r\nExternally, this mansion, though imposing in itself, resembled in its\r\ndecorations, ruffles of Alençon lace, so loaded was it with ornament.\r\nCount John Czernickeff was appointed to attend on Prince Charles, and\r\nthe Prince was provided with everything he required at the expense of\r\nthe court, and waited on by the servants of the court.\r\n\r\nThe night preceding the day of Prince Charles's visit to us, I suffered\r\nso severely from a violent attack of cholic, with such looseness of the\r\nbowels that they were moved more than thirty times. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, and the fever consequent upon it, I dressed the next morning to\r\nreceive the Prince of Saxony. He was presented to the Empress about two\r\no'clock in the afternoon, and, upon leaving her, was presented to me.\r\nThe Grand Duke was to enter a moment after him. Three arm-chairs had\r\nbeen placed side by side along the same wall, the centre one was for me,\r\nthat on my right for the Grand Duke, and the one on my left for the\r\nPrince of Saxony. The task of keeping up the conversation devolved\r\nentirely upon me, for the Grand Duke had hardly a word to say, and the\r\nPrince had no conversational powers. In short, after a brief interview\r\nof a quarter of an hour's length, Prince Charles arose to present his\r\nimmense _suite_ to us. There were with him, I think, more than twenty\r\npersons, to whom were added, upon this occasion, the Polish and Saxon\r\nEnvoys who resided at the Russian Court, together with their employés.\r\nAfter half an hour's interview the Prince took leave, and I undressed\r\nand went to bed, where I remained three or four days in a very violent\r\nfever, at the end of which I showed some signs of pregnancy. At the end\r\nof April we went to Oranienbaum. Before our departure we learnt that\r\nPrince Charles of Saxony intended to join the Russian army as a\r\nvolunteer. Before leaving for the army, he went with the Empress to\r\nPetershoff where he was _fêted_. We took no part in these festivities,\r\nor in those given in the capital, but remained at our country-house,\r\nwhere he came to take leave of us, and then departed on the 4th of July.\r\n\r\nAs the Grand Duke was almost always in very bad humour with me, for\r\nwhich I could find no other reasons than my not receiving either M.\r\nBrockdorf or the Countess Voronzoff, who again was becoming the reigning\r\nfavourite, it occurred to me to give a _fête_ to his Imperial Highness\r\nin my garden at Oranienbaum, in order, if possible, to mitigate this\r\nill-feeling. A _fête_ was a thing always welcome to his Imperial\r\nHighness. Accordingly, I ordered an Italian architect who was at that\r\ntime in my service, Antonio Renaldi, to construct, in a retired spot in\r\nthe wood a large car capable of containing an orchestra of sixty\r\npersons, singers and instrumentalists. I had verses composed by the\r\nItalian poet of the court, and set to music by the chapel-master,\r\nAraja. In the large avenue of the garden was placed an illuminated\r\ndecoration with a curtain, opposite to which a table was laid out for\r\nsupper. On the 17th of July, at the close of day, his Imperial Highness,\r\nand all who were at Oranienbaum and numerous spectators from St.\r\nPetersburg and Cronstadt, assembled in the gardens which they found\r\nilluminated. We sat down to table, and, after the first course, the\r\ncurtain which concealed the grand avenue was raised, and in the distance\r\nthe ambulatory orchestra was seen approaching, drawn by twenty oxen,\r\ndecorated with garlands and surrounded by all the dancers, male and\r\nfemale, that I had been able to get together. The avenue was\r\nilluminated, and so bright that everything could be plainly\r\ndistinguished. When the car stopped, it so happened that the moon stood\r\ndirectly over it--a circumstance which produced an admirable effect and\r\ntook the company quite by surprise; the weather, besides, was most\r\ndelightful. The guests sprang from table, and advanced nearer to enjoy\r\nmore fully the beauty of the symphony and of the spectacle. When this\r\nwas ended the curtain dropped, and we sat down again to table for the\r\nsecond course; after which a flourish of trumpets and cymbals was heard,\r\nand then a mountebank cried out, \"This way, ladies and gentlemen; walk\r\nin here, and you will find lottery tickets for nothing.\" At each side of\r\nthe curtained decoration two small curtains were now raised, displaying\r\ntwo small shops brightly illuminated, at one of which tickets were\r\ndistributed gratis for a lottery of the porcelain it contained; and, in\r\nthe other, for flowers, fans, combs, purses, ribbons, gloves,\r\nsword-knots, and other similar trifles. When the stalls were empty\r\ndessert was served, and afterwards came dancing, which was kept up till\r\nsix the next morning. For once in the way, no intrigue or ill-will\r\noccurred to mar the effect of my _fête_, and his Imperial Highness and\r\nevery one besides was in ecstasies. Nothing was to be heard but\r\nlaudations of the Grand Duchess and her _fête_; and, indeed, I had\r\nspared no expense. My wine was pronounced delicious; the repast the best\r\npossible. All was at my own expense, and cost from 10,000 to 15,000\r\nroubles; it must be remembered that I had 30,000 roubles a-year. But\r\nthis _fête_ was near costing me still more dearly; for, during the day\r\nof the 17th of July, having gone in a cabriolet with Madame Narichkine\r\nto see the preparations, and wishing to descend from the carriage, just\r\nas I placed my foot on the step, a sudden movement of the horse threw me\r\non my knees on the ground. I was then four or five months advanced in\r\npregnancy. I pretended to make light of the accident, and remained the\r\nlast at the _fête_, doing the honours. However I was very much afraid of\r\na miscarriage, but no ill result occurred, and I escaped with nothing\r\nworse than the fright.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke, and all his coterie, all his Holstein retainers, and\r\neven my most rancorous enemies, for days afterwards, were never tired of\r\nsinging my praises, and those of my _fête_, there being no one, either\r\nfriend or foe, who did not carry off some trifle or other, as a\r\nsouvenir; and as at the _fête_, which was a masquerade, there was a\r\nnumerous assemblage of all ranks, and as the company in the garden was\r\nvery mixed, and as among them were a number of women who could not\r\nelsewhere have appeared at court, or in my presence, all made a boast\r\nand display of my presents, which were, in reality, mere trifles, none\r\nof them, I believe, exceeding a hundred roubles in value; but they came\r\nfrom me, and every one was delighted to be able to say, \"I received that\r\nfrom her Imperial Highness the Grand Duchess; she is goodness itself;\r\nshe has made presents to every one; she is charming; she gave me a kind\r\nsmile, and took pleasure in making us all eat, dance, and divert\r\nourselves; she was always ready to find a place for those who had none,\r\nand wished every one to see all that was to be seen. She was very\r\nlively,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn short, on that day I was found to possess qualities which had not\r\nbefore been recognized, and I disarmed my enemies. This was what I\r\nwanted; but it did not last long, as will shortly appear.\r\n\r\nAfter this _fête_, Leon Narichkine renewed his visits to me. One day, on\r\nentering my boudoir, I found him impertinently stretched on a couch\r\nwhich was there, and singing an absurd song; seeing this, I went out,\r\nclosing the door after me, and immediately went in search of his\r\nsister-in-law, whom I told that we must get a good bundle of nettles,\r\nand with them chastise this fellow, who had for some time past behaved\r\nso insolently towards us, and teach him to respect us. His sister-in-law\r\nreadily consented, and we forthwith had brought to us some good strong\r\nrods, surrounded with nettles. We took along with us a widow, who was\r\nwith me, among my women, by name Tatiana Jourievna, and we all three\r\nentered the cabinet, where we found Leon Narichkine singing his song at\r\nthe top of his voice. When he saw us he tried to make off, but we\r\nwhipped him so well with our rods and nettles, that his hands, legs, and\r\nface were swollen for two or three days to such a degree that he could\r\nnot accompany us to Peterhoff on the morrow, which was a court day, but\r\nwas obliged to remain in his room. He took care, besides, not to boast\r\nof what had occurred, because we assured him that on the least sign of\r\nimpoliteness, or ground of complaint from him, we would renew the\r\noperation, seeing that there was no other means of managing him. All\r\nthis was done as mere joke, and without anger, but our hero felt it\r\nsufficiently to recollect it, and did not again expose himself to it, at\r\nleast, not to the same extent as before.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, while at Oranienbaum, we learnt that the battle\r\nof Zorndorff, one of the most sanguinary of the century, had been fought\r\non the 14th of that month. The number of killed and wounded, on each\r\nside, was calculated at upwards of 20,000. Our loss in officers was\r\nconsiderable, and exceeded 1,200. This battle was announced to us as a\r\nvictory, but it was whispered that the loss was equal on both sides;\r\nthat for the space of three days neither army ventured to claim the\r\nvictory; that finally, on the third day, the King of Prussia, in his\r\ncamp, and the Count Fermor on the field of battle, had each caused the\r\n_Te Deum_ to be sung. The vexation of the Empress and the consternation\r\nof the city were extreme when they learned all the details of this\r\nbloody day, in which so many people lost relatives, friends, or\r\nacquaintances. For a long time all was sorrow; a great many generals\r\nwere slain or wounded or taken prisoners. At last, it was acknowledged,\r\nthat the conduct of Count Fermor was anything but soldierly and skilful.\r\nHe was recalled, and the command of the Russian forces in Prussia was\r\ngiven to Count Peter Soltikoff. For this purpose he was summoned from\r\nthe Ukraine, where he commanded, and in the interim the command of the\r\narmy was given to General Froloff Bagreeff, but with secret instructions\r\nto do nothing without the concurrence of the Lieutenant-Generals Count\r\nRoumianzoff and Prince Alexander Galitzine, his brother-in-law. A charge\r\nwas brought, to the effect that Fermor, being at no great distance from\r\nthe field of battle, with a force of 10,000 men upon the heights,\r\nwhence he could hear the cannonade, might have rendered the action more\r\ndecisive, had he attacked the Prussian army in the rear while engaged\r\nwith ours. He neglected to do this, and when his brother-in-law, Prince\r\nGalitzine, came to his camp after the battle, and detailed the butchery\r\nthat had taken place, he received him very ill, said many disagreeable\r\nthings to him, and refused to see him afterwards, treating him as a\r\ncoward, which Prince Galitzine by no means was, the entire army being\r\nmore convinced of his intrepidity than of that of Roumianzoff,\r\nnotwithstanding his present glory and victories. At the beginning of\r\nSeptember the Empress was at Zarskoe Selo, where, on the 8th of the\r\nmonth, the day of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, she went on foot\r\nfrom the palace to the parish church to hear mass, the distance being\r\nonly a few steps towards the north from the palace-door to the church.\r\nScarcely had the service commenced, when, feeling unwell, she left the\r\nchurch, and descended the little flight of steps which turns towards the\r\npalace, and, on arriving at the re-entering angle of the side of the\r\nchurch, she fell down insensible on the grass, in the midst of, or\r\nrather surrounded by, a crowd of people who had come to hear mass from\r\nall the neighbouring villages. None of her attendants had followed her\r\nwhen she left the church; but being soon apprised of her condition, the\r\nladies of her suite, and her other intimate attendants, ran to her\r\nassistance, and found her without consciousness or movement in the midst\r\nof the crowd, who gazed upon her without daring to approach. The Empress\r\nwas tall and powerful, and could not fall down suddenly without doing\r\nherself a good deal of injury by the mere fall. They covered her with a\r\nwhite handkerchief, and went to fetch the physician and surgeon. The\r\nlatter arrived first, and instantly bled her, just as she lay on the\r\nground, and in the presence of all the crowd. But this did not bring her\r\nto. The physician was a long time in coming, being himself ill, and\r\nunable to walk. He was obliged to be carried in an arm-chair. The\r\nphysician was the late Condoijdij, a Greek by nation, and the surgeon,\r\nFouzadier, a French refugee. At last screens were brought from the\r\npalace as well as a couch, on which she was placed, and by dint of care,\r\nand the remedies applied, she began to revive a little; but, on opening\r\nher eyes, she recognized no one, and asked, in a scarcely intelligible\r\nmanner, where she was. All this lasted above two hours, at the end of\r\nwhich it was determined to carry her Majesty on the couch to the palace.\r\nThe consternation into which this event threw all who were attached to\r\nthe court may easily be imagined. The publicity of the affair added to\r\nits unpleasantness. Hitherto the state of the Empress had been kept very\r\nsecret, but in this case the accident was public. The next morning I was\r\ninformed of the event at Oranienbaum by a note from Count Poniatowsky. I\r\nimmediately went and told the Grand Duke, who knew nothing of it;\r\nbecause, generally speaking, every thing was carefully concealed from\r\nus, and more especially all that concerned the Empress herself. Only\r\nthat it was customary, whenever we happened not to be in the same place\r\nas her Majesty, to send every Sunday one of the gentlemen of our court\r\nto make inquiries after her health. This we did not fail to do on the\r\nfollowing Sunday, and we learnt that for several days the Empress had\r\nnot recovered the free use of speech, and that even yet she articulated\r\nwith difficulty. It was asserted that during her swoon she had bitten\r\nher tongue. All this gave reason for supposing that this weakness\r\npartook more of the nature of convulsions than mere fainting.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September we returned to the capital, and as I began to\r\nget large, I no longer appeared in public, believing that the period of\r\nmy confinement was much nearer than it really proved to be. This was a\r\nsource of annoyance to the Grand Duke, because, when I appeared in\r\npublic, he very often complained of indisposition, in order to be able\r\nto remain in his own apartments, and, as the Empress also rarely\r\nappeared, the burden of the reception days, the _fêtes_, and the balls\r\nof the court devolved upon me, and when I could not be there, his\r\nImperial Highness was teased to be present, in order that some one might\r\nrepresent her Majesty. He, therefore, began to be annoyed at my\r\npregnancy, and one day took it in his head to say, in his apartment,\r\nbefore Leon Narichkine, and several others, \"God knows where my wife\r\ngets her pregnancies, I don't very well know whether this child is mine,\r\nand whether I ought to take the responsibility of it.\" Leon Narichkine\r\ncame running to me with these words, fresh from the Duke's lips. I was\r\nnaturally enough alarmed at such a speech, and said to him, \"How stupid\r\nyou all are. Go and ask him to swear that he has not slept with his\r\nwife, and tell him if he will take this oath, you will go immediately\r\nand give information of it to Alexander Schouvaloff as grand inquisitor\r\nof the empire.\" Leon actually went to his Imperial Highness, and asked\r\nhim for this oath, but the answer he got was, \"Go to the devil, and\r\ndon't talk to me any more about that.\" This speech of the Grand Duke,\r\nmade so indiscreetly, gave me great pain, and I saw from that moment\r\nthat three paths almost equally perilous presented themselves for my\r\nchoice: first, to share the fortunes of the Grand Duke, be they what\r\nthey might; secondly, to be exposed every moment to everything he chose\r\nto do either for or against me; or, lastly, to take a path entirely\r\nindependent of all eventualities; to speak more plainly, I had to choose\r\nthe alternative of perishing with him, or by him, or to save myself, my\r\nchildren, and perhaps the empire also, from the wreck of which all the\r\nmoral and physical qualities of this Prince made me foresee the danger.\r\nThis last choice appeared to me the safest. I resolved, therefore, to\r\nthe utmost of my power to continue to give him on all occasions the very\r\nbest advice I could for his benefit, but never to persist in this, as I\r\nhad hitherto done, so as to make him angry; to open his eyes to his true\r\ninterests on every opportunity that presented itself; and, during the\r\nrest of the time, to maintain a gloomy silence; and, on the other hand,\r\nto take care of my own interests with the public, so that in the time of\r\nneed they might see in me the saviour of the commonwealth. In the month\r\nof October I was informed by the High Chancellor, Count Bestoujeff, that\r\nthe King of Poland had just sent Count Poniatowsky his letters of\r\nrecall. Count Bestoujeff had had a violent dispute upon this subject\r\nwith Count Brühl and the Cabinet of Saxony, and was annoyed that he had\r\nnot been consulted in the matter as heretofore. He learned at last that\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor, Count Voronzoff, and John Schouvaloff had, with the\r\nassistance of Prasse, the resident minister of Saxony, secretly\r\nmanoeuvred the whole affair. This M. Prasse, moreover, often appeared\r\nto be well informed of a number of secrets which it puzzled every one to\r\nconjecture whence he had obtained them. Many years afterwards their\r\nsource was discovered. He carried on a love intrigue, though very\r\nsecretly and very discreetly, with the Vice-Chancellor's wife, the\r\nCountess Anna Karlovna, whose maiden name was Scavronsky. This lady was\r\nthe intimate friend of the wife of Samarine, the master of the\r\nceremonies, and it was at the house of the latter that the Countess saw\r\nM. Prasse. The Chancellor Bestoujeff had all the letters of recall\r\nbrought to him, and sent them back to Saxony under pretext of\r\ninformality.\r\n\r\nIn the night between the 8th and 9th of December, I began to feel the\r\npains of childbirth. I sent to inform the Grand Duke by Madame\r\nVladislava, and also Count Schouvaloff, that he might announce the fact\r\nto her Imperial Majesty. In a short time the Grand Duke came into my\r\nroom, dressed in his Holstein uniform, booted and spurred, with his\r\nscarf round his body, and an enormous sword at his side, having made an\r\nelaborate toilet. It was about half-past two in the morning. Astonished\r\nat his appearance, I inquired the reason of this grand dress. He replied\r\nthat it was only on an emergency that true friends could be discerned;\r\nthat in this garb he was ready to act as duty demanded; that the duty of\r\na Holstein officer was to defend, according to his oath, the ducal\r\npalace against all its enemies, and that as I was ill he had hastened to\r\nmy assistance. One would have supposed him jesting; but not at all, he\r\nwas quite serious. I saw at once that he was intoxicated, and advised\r\nhim to go to bed, that the Empress when she came might not have the\r\ndouble annoyance of seeing him in such a state, and armed _cap-a-pie_ in\r\nthe Holstein uniform, which I knew she detested. I had great difficulty\r\nin getting him to leave; however, Madame Vladislava and myself finally\r\npersuaded him, with the help of the midwife, who assured him that I\r\nshould not be delivered for some time yet. At length he went away, and\r\nthe Empress arrived. She asked where the Grand Duke was, and she was\r\ninformed that he had just quitted the room, and would not fail to\r\nreturn. When she found that the pains abated, and that the midwife told\r\nher I might not be confined for some hours yet, she returned to her\r\napartments, and I went to bed and slept till the next morning, when I\r\ngot up as usual, feeling however occasional pains, after which I\r\ncontinued for hours together entirely free from them. Towards supper\r\ntime I felt hungry, and ordered some supper to be brought. The midwife\r\nwas sitting near me, and seeing me eat ravenously, she said, \"Eat, eat:\r\nthis supper will bring you good luck.\" In fact, having finished my\r\nsupper, I rose from the table, and the moment I did so was seized with\r\nsuch a pain, that I gave a loud scream. The midwife and Madame\r\nVladislava seized me under my arms, and placed me on the \"bed of pain,\"\r\nand went to seek the Empress and the Grand Duke. Scarcely had they\r\narrived when I was delivered (between ten and eleven o'clock at night),\r\non the 9th of December, of a daughter, whom I begged the Empress to\r\nallow me to name after her. But she decided that she should be named\r\nafter her eldest sister, Anne Petrovna, Duchess of Holstein, mother of\r\nthe Grand Duke. His Imperial Highness appeared much pleased at the birth\r\nof this child; he made great rejoicings over it in his own apartments,\r\nordered rejoicings to be made in Holstein also, and received all the\r\ncompliments paid to him on the subject with great manifestations of\r\npleasure. On the sixth day the Empress stood godmother to the child, and\r\nbrought me an order on the cabinet for 60,000 roubles. A similar present\r\nwas sent to the Grand Duke, which added not a little to his\r\nsatisfaction. After the baptism the _fêtes_ commenced, which were very\r\nmagnificent, according to report. I saw none of them, but remained in my\r\nbed, very delicate and quite alone, not a living soul to keep me\r\ncompany; for no sooner was I delivered than the Empress not only carried\r\noff the child to her own apartments as previously, but under the plea of\r\nmy requiring repose, I was left there and abandoned like any poor\r\nwretch, no one entering my apartments to ask how I was, or even sending\r\nto inquire. As on the former occasion, I had suffered a great deal from\r\nthis neglect. I had this time taken all possible precautions against\r\ndraughts, and the other inconveniences of the place; and as soon as I\r\nwas delivered I arose and went to my bed, and as no one dared to visit\r\nme, unless secretly, I had also taken care to provide for this\r\ncontingency. My bed stood nearly in the middle of a rather long room,\r\nthe windows being on the right side of the bed. There was also a side\r\ndoor, which opened into a kind of wardrobe, which served also as an\r\nante-chamber, and which was well barricaded with screens and trunks.\r\nFrom the bed to this door I had placed an immense screen which concealed\r\nthe prettiest little boudoir I could devise, considering the locality\r\nand the circumstances. In this boudoir were a couch, mirrors, moveable\r\ntables, and some chairs. When the curtains of my bed on that side were\r\ndrawn, nothing could be seen; but when they were pulled aside, I could\r\nsee the boudoir, and those who happened to be in it. But any one\r\nentering the room could only see the screens. If any one asked what was\r\nbehind the screen, the answer was, the commode; and this being within\r\nthe screen, no one was anxious to see it; or even if so, it could be\r\nshown without getting into the boudoir, which the screen effectively\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1759.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1759, the court festivities terminated with a\r\ngrand display of fireworks between the ball and the supper. As I still\r\nkept my room, I did not appear at court. Before the fireworks were let\r\noff, Count Peter Schouvaloff took it into his head to present himself at\r\nmy door, to show me the plan of them before they were let off. Madame\r\nVladislava told him I was asleep, but however she would go and see. It\r\nwas not true that I was asleep; I was merely in bed, and had my usual\r\nlittle party, which then, as formerly, consisted of Mesdames Narichkine,\r\nSiniavine, Ismaïloff, and Count Poniatowsky. The latter, since his\r\nrecall, had given out that he was ill, but came to visit me, and these\r\nladies loved me sufficiently to prefer my company to the balls and\r\n_fêtes_. Madame Vladislava did not exactly know who was with me, but she\r\nwas a great deal too shrewd not to suspect that there was some one. I\r\nhad told her early that I should go to bed, as I felt weary; and then\r\nshe did not afterwards disturb me. Upon the arrival of Count\r\nSchouvaloff, she came and knocked at my door. I drew the curtain on the\r\nside of the screen, and told her to enter. She came in, and brought me\r\nthe message of Count Peter Schouvaloff, and I ordered her to admit him.\r\nWhile she went to execute this order, my friends behind the screen were\r\nbursting with laughter at the extreme absurdity of the scene--my being\r\nabout to receive Count Schouvaloff, who would be able to swear that he\r\nhad found me alone, and in bed, while there was only a curtain which\r\nseparated my gay little party from this most important personage, who\r\nwas at that time the oracle of the court, and possessed the confidence\r\nof the Empress to a very high degree. In, therefore, he came, and\r\nbrought me his plan for the fireworks. He was at the time Grand Master\r\nof Artillery. I began by making apologies for keeping him waiting--only\r\nhaving, I said, just awoke; I rubbed my eyes, saying that I was still\r\nquite sleepy. I told a story, not to make Madame Vladislava out a\r\nstory-teller. After this, I entered into a rather long conversation with\r\nhim, so much so even, that he appeared anxious to leave, in order not to\r\nkeep the Empress waiting for the commencement of the fireworks. I then\r\ndismissed him. He took his departure, and I again drew aside the\r\ncurtain. My company, from laughing so heartily, was beginning to feel\r\nhungry and thirsty. \"Very well,\" I said, \"you shall have something to\r\neat and drink; it is only fair that while you are kind enough to give me\r\nyour company, you should not die of hunger or thirst.\" I closed the\r\ncurtain and rang; Madame Vladislava presented herself. I told her that I\r\nwas starving, and desired her to bring me some supper. I said I must\r\nhave at least six good dishes. When it was ready it was brought to me,\r\nand I had it placed by the side of my bed, and told the servant not to\r\nwait. Then my friends from behind the screen came out like so many\r\nfamished creatures to eat whatever they could find; the fun of the thing\r\nincreased their appetite. In fact, this evening was one of the merriest\r\nI have ever passed in the whole course of my life. When the supper had\r\nbeen devoured, I had the remains cleared away in the same manner as it\r\nhad been served. I fancy however the servants were a little surprised at\r\nmy appetite. About the time the court supper had concluded, my party\r\nretired also very well pleased with their evening. Count Poniatowsky,\r\nwhen going out, always wore a wig of fair hair and a cloak, and to the\r\nquestion of the sentinels, \"Who goes there?\" was accustomed to answer\r\nthat he was a musician to the Grand Duke. This wig made us laugh a good\r\ndeal that day.\r\n\r\nThis time my churching, after the six weeks, took place in the Empress'\r\nchapel; but no one assisted at it except Alexander Schouvaloff. Towards\r\nthe end of the Carnival, and when all the _fêtes_ of the city were\r\nfinished, three weddings took place at court: that of Count Alexander\r\nStrogonoff with the Countess Anne Voronzoff, daughter of the\r\nVice-Chancellor, was the first; and, two days after, that of Leon\r\nNarichkine with Mademoiselle Zakrefsky; and, on the same day, also, that\r\nof Count Boutourline with the Countess Marie Voronzoff. These three\r\nyoung ladies were Maids of Honour to the Empress. At the celebration of\r\nthese weddings, a bet was made at court between the Hetman Count\r\nRasoumowsky and the Minister of Denmark, Count d'Osten, as to which of\r\nthe three newly-made husbands should be first cuckolded, and it turned\r\nout that those who had bet that it would be Strogonoff, whose bride\r\nappeared the plainest of the three, and at the time the most innocent\r\nand childlike, won the wager.\r\n\r\nThe evening preceding the day on which Leon Narichkine and Count\r\nBoutourline were married, was an unfortunate one. For a long time, it\r\nhad been whispered that the credit of the Grand Chancellor was wavering,\r\nand that his enemies were getting the upper hand of him. He had lost his\r\nfriend, General Apraxine. Count Rasoumowsky, the elder, had for a long\r\ntime supported him; but ever since the influence of the Schouvaloffs had\r\npreponderated, he scarcely meddled with anything, except, when occasion\r\noffered, to ask for some trifling favour for his friends or connections.\r\nThe hatred of Schouvaloff and Voronzoff against the Chancellor was still\r\nfurther increased by the efforts of the Ambassadors of Austria and\r\nFrance, Count Esterhazy, and Marshal de l'Hôpital. The latter thought\r\nCount Bestoujeff more disposed for an alliance with England than with\r\nFrance, and the Ambassador of Austria caballed against him, because,\r\nwhile he wished Russia should adhere to her treaty of alliance with the\r\nCourt of Vienna, and give aid to Maria Theresa, he did not wish that she\r\nshould take a leading part in a war against the King of Prussia. The\r\nviews of Count Bestoujeff were those of a patriot, and he was not easily\r\nled; whereas the Messrs. Voronzoff and John Schouvaloff were the tools\r\nof the two ambassadors to such an extent that a fortnight before the\r\nGrand Chancellor's disgrace, the Marquis de l'Hôpital, Ambassador of\r\nFrance, went to Count Voronzoff, despatch in hand, and said to him,\r\n\"Monsieur le Comte, here is the despatch of my court, which I have just\r\nreceived, and in which it is said that if, within a fortnight, the Grand\r\nChancellor is not displaced by you, I am to address myself to him, and\r\ntreat with no one but him.\" Then the Vice-Chancellor took fire, and went\r\nto John Schouvaloff, and they represented to the Empress that her glory\r\nwas suffering from the credit which Count Bestoujeff enjoyed throughout\r\nEurope. She ordered that a conference should be held that very evening,\r\nand that the Grand Chancellor should be summoned to it. The latter sent\r\nword that he was ill. This illness was represented as a disobedience,\r\nand word was sent to him to come without delay. He went, and, on his\r\narrival, he was arrested in full conference. He was deprived of his\r\noffices, his titles, and his orders, without any one being able to say\r\nfor what crimes or delinquencies; the first personage of the empire was\r\nthus despoiled. He was sent back to his house a prisoner. As all this\r\nwas pre-arranged, a company of grenadiers of the guard was called out.\r\nThese, as they passed along the Moïka, where the Counts Alexander and\r\nPeter Schouvaloff lived, said to one another, \"Thank God, we are going\r\nto arrest those cursed Schouvaloffs, who do nothing but invent\r\nmonopolies.\" But when the soldiers found that it was Count Bestoujeff\r\nwhom they had to arrest, they gave evident signs of displeasure, saying,\r\n\"It is not this man, it is the others, who trample on the people.\"\r\n\r\nThough Count Bestoujeff had been arrested in the very palace of which we\r\noccupied a wing, and not very far from our apartments, we heard nothing\r\nof it that evening, so careful were they to keep from us all that was\r\ngoing on. The next day (Sunday) I received, on waking, a note from Leon\r\nNarichkine, which the Count Poniatowsky forwarded to me by this channel,\r\nwhich had long since become of very questionable security. It commenced\r\nwith these words:--\"Man is never without resources. I employ this means\r\nof informing you, that last night, Count Bestoujeff was arrested and\r\ndeprived of his offices and dignities, and with him your jeweller\r\nBernardi, Teleguine, and Adadouroff.\" I was thunderstruck upon reading\r\nthese lines, and, having read them, I felt that I must by no means\r\nflatter myself that this affair did not affect me more nearly than yet\r\nappeared. Now, to make this understood, a few comments are necessary.\r\nBernardi was an Italian jeweller, not without talent, and whose business\r\ngave him the _entrée_ to every house. I think that there was scarcely\r\none which did not owe him something, or to which he had not rendered\r\nsome little service or other, as he went continually to and fro\r\neverywhere. He was also intrusted sometimes with commissions from one to\r\nthe other. A note sent through Bernardi always reached its destination\r\nsooner and more safely than if sent by the servants. Now the arrest of\r\nBernardi interested the whole city, since he executed commissions for\r\neverybody, and for me among the rest. Teleguine was the former Adjutant\r\nof the Master of the Hounds, Count Rasoumowsky, who had had the\r\nguardianship of Beketoff. He had remained attached to the house of\r\nRasoumowsky. He had also become the friend of Count Poniatowsky. He was\r\na man of integrity, and one who could be relied on; and when once his\r\naffection was gained it was not easily lost. He had always shown a\r\npredilection for me, and zeal in my interest. Adadouroff had been\r\nformerly my master in the Russian language, and had remained much\r\nattached to me. It was I who had recommended him to Count Bestoujeff,\r\nwho, within the last two or three years only, had begun to place\r\nconfidence in him. Formerly, he did not like him, because he held to the\r\nparty of the Procurator-General, Prince Nikita Youriewitch Troubetskoy,\r\nthe enemy of Bestoujeff.\r\n\r\nAfter the perusal of the note, and the reflections which I have just\r\nmade, a crowd of ideas, one more disagreeable than another, presented\r\nthemselves to my mind. With the iron in my soul, so to speak, I dressed,\r\nand went to mass, where it seemed to me that the greater part of those I\r\nsaw had faces as long as my own. No one made any remark to me during the\r\nday; it was just as if every one was in total ignorance of what had\r\nhappened. I was silent also. The Grand Duke, who had never liked Count\r\nBestoujeff, appeared to be rather gay on this occasion, yet behaved\r\nwithout affectation, though he rather kept away from me a good deal. In\r\nthe evening I was obliged to go to the wedding; I changed my dress, was\r\npresent at the benediction of the marriages of Count Boutourline and\r\nLeon Narichkine, at the ball, and at the supper, during which I\r\napproached the Marshal of the wedding, Prince Nikita Troubetskoy, and,\r\nunder pretence of examining the ribbons of his marshal's baton, I\r\nwhispered to him, \"What do all these fine doings mean? Have you found\r\nmore crimes than criminals, or more criminals than crimes?\" To which he\r\nreplied--\"We have done what we were ordered; but as for crimes, they are\r\nstill to be discovered. Thus far, the search has not been successful.\"\r\nHaving finished with him, I approached Marshal Boutourline, who said to\r\nme--\"Bestoujeff is arrested, but we have yet to learn why he is so.\"\r\nThus spoke the two commissioners appointed by the Empress to investigate\r\nthe causes that had led to his arrest by Count Alexander Schouvaloff. I\r\nalso perceived Stambke at the ball, but at a distance, and I saw that\r\nhis countenance wore an expression of suffering and of despondency. The\r\nEmpress was not present at either of these two marriages, neither in\r\nchurch nor at the feast. The next day, Stambke came to my apartments,\r\nand told me that he had just received a note from Count Bestoujeff,\r\nwhich begged that he would inform me that I need be under no\r\napprehension concerning what I knew; that he had had time to burn\r\neverything, and that he would communicate to him (Stambke), by the same\r\nchannel, the interrogatories which might be put to him. I asked what\r\nthat channel was? He told me that it was by a horn-player in the Count's\r\nservice, who had brought him the note, and that it had been arranged,\r\nthat for the future, any communications it might be desirable to make\r\nshould be placed in a particular spot, among some bricks, not far from\r\nthe Count's house. I told Stambke to take care that this dangerous\r\ncorrespondence was not discovered, though he appeared to be suffering\r\ngreat anxiety himself. However, he and Count Poniatowsky still continued\r\nit. As soon as Stambke had left, I called Madame Vladislava, and told\r\nher to go to her brother-in-law, Pougowoschnikoff, and give him the note\r\nI was writing to him. It contained only these words:--\"You have nothing\r\nto fear; there has been time to burn all.\" This tranquillized him; for,\r\nit appears, that ever since the arrest of the High Chancellor, he had\r\nbeen more dead than alive. This it is which occasioned his anxiety, and\r\nwhat the Count Bestoujeff had had time to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe weak state of the Empress' health, and the convulsive fits to which\r\nshe was subject, very naturally made all eyes turn to the future. Count\r\nBestoujeff, both from his position and abilities, was certainly not one\r\nof the last to do so. He knew well the antipathy that had long been\r\nexcited against him in the mind of the Grand Duke. He was also well\r\naware of the feeble capacity of this Prince, born heir to so many\r\ncrowns. It was only natural that this statesman, like every one else,\r\nshould wish to maintain himself in his position. For several years past\r\nhe had seen me laying aside my prejudices against him; perhaps, also, he\r\nregarded me personally as the only one upon whom at that time the hopes\r\nof the public could rest, in the event of the Empress' death.\r\n\r\nThese and such like reflections had induced him to form the plan that,\r\non the decease of the Empress, the Grand Duke should be proclaimed\r\nEmperor of right, but that at the same time I should be declared a\r\nparticipator with him in the administration; that all existing offices\r\nshould be continued, and that, for himself, he should receive the\r\nlieutenant-colonelcy of the four regiments of guards, and the Presidency\r\nof the three Colleges of the Empire, of that of foreign affairs, of War,\r\nand of the Admiralty. His pretensions were consequently excessive. He\r\nhad forwarded me, through Count Poniatowsky, the draught of this\r\nproject, written by the hand of Pougowoschnikoff. I had agreed with the\r\nformer that I should thank him verbally for his good intentions towards\r\nme, but that I regarded the plan as difficult of execution. He had had\r\nthis project written and re-written several times, had altered,\r\namplified, retrenched, and appeared to be quite absorbed by it. To speak\r\nthe truth, I looked upon it as the effect of mere dotage, and as a bait\r\nwhich the old man was throwing out in order to obtain a firmer hold on\r\nmy friendship; but I did not catch at this bait, because I regarded it\r\nas prejudicial to the Empire, that every quarrel between my husband (who\r\ndid not love me) and myself should convulse the state; but as the\r\noccasion for such a course did not yet exist, I did not wish to oppose\r\nan old man who, when once he took a thing into his head, was self-willed\r\nand immovable. This, then, was the project which he had found time to\r\ndestroy, and concerning which he had sent me word, in order that I might\r\ntranquillize those who had been privy to it.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, my valet de chambre, Skourine, came to tell me that\r\nthe captain who guarded Count Bestoujeff was a man who had always been\r\nhis friend, and who dined with him every Sunday, when he left court and\r\nwent home. I said that if this were the case, and if he could be relied\r\non, he should endeavour to sound him, and see if he would allow any\r\ncommunication with the prisoner. This had become the more necessary as\r\nCount Bestoujeff had communicated to Stambke, by the mode already\r\nmentioned, that he wished Bernardi to be told from him to speak the\r\nsimple truth when interrogated, and to let him know what were the\r\nquestions asked. When I perceived that Skourine willingly undertook to\r\ndiscover some means of communicating with Count Bestoujeff, I told him\r\nalso to try and open some means of communication with Bernardi as well,\r\nand see if he could not gain over the sergeant or some soldier who kept\r\nguard in his quarter. On the evening of the same day, Skourine told me\r\nthat Bernardi was guarded by a sergeant of the guards named Kalichkine,\r\nwith whom he was to have an interview on the morrow; but that having\r\nsent to his friend the captain, who was with the Count Bestoujeff, to\r\nask if he could see him, the latter had informed him that if he wished\r\nto see him he must come to his house; but that one of his subalterns,\r\nwhom he also knew, and who was his relation, had cautioned him not to go\r\nthere, because if he did, the captain would arrest him, and would make a\r\nmerit of so doing at his expense, and that of this he had boasted to a\r\nconfidant. Skourine therefore kept away from his pretended friend.\r\nHowever Kalichkine, whom I had ordered to be gained over in my name,\r\ntold Bernardi all that was necessary; besides, he was only asked to\r\nspeak the simple truth, and to this both willingly lent themselves.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a few days, very early one morning, Stambke came into my\r\nroom, very pale and greatly frightened, and told me that his\r\ncorrespondence and that of Count Bestoujeff with Count Poniatowsky had\r\nbeen discovered; that the little horn-player had been arrested, and that\r\nthere was every reason to fear that their last letters had fallen into\r\nthe hands of Count Bestoujeff's keepers; that he himself expected every\r\nmoment to be dismissed, if not arrested; and that he had come to tell me\r\nthis, and to take his leave of me. This information caused me no little\r\nanxiety. However, I consoled him as well as I could, and sent him away,\r\nnot doubting but that his visit would tend to augment against me, if\r\nthat were possible, all kinds of ill-feeling, and that I should,\r\nperhaps, be shunned as a person suspected by the Government. I was,\r\nhowever, well satisfied in my own mind that I had nothing to reproach\r\nmyself with against the Government. With the exception of Michel\r\nVoronzoff, John Schouvaloff, the two Ambassadors of Austria and France,\r\nand those whom these parties made to believe whatever they wished, the\r\ngeneral public, every one in St. Petersburg, great and small, was\r\npersuaded that Count Bestoujeff was innocent, and that there was neither\r\ncrime nor delinquency to be laid to his charge. It was known that the\r\nday following the evening of his arrest, a manifesto had been concocted\r\nin the chamber of Ivan Schouvaloff, which the Sieur Volkoff, formerly\r\nfirst commissary of Count Bestoujeff, and who, in the year 1755, had\r\nabsconded from his house, and after wandering some time in the woods,\r\nhad allowed himself to be taken, and who was at this moment first\r\nSecretary to the Conference, had to draw up, and which they intended to\r\npublish, in order to make known the reasons which had constrained the\r\nEmpress to act towards the Grand Chancellor in the way she had done.\r\nNow, in this secret conference, in which they had to torment their\r\nbrains to discover offences, they agreed to state that it was for the\r\ncrime of high treason, and because Bestoujeff had endeavoured to sow\r\ndissension between her Imperial Majesty and their Imperial Highnesses;\r\nand it was their wish, the very day after his arrest, to banish him to\r\none of his estates, and deprive him of the rest of his property, without\r\ntrial or judgment. But there were some who thought that it was going too\r\nfar to exile a man without crime or trial, and that it was, at least,\r\nnecessary to look about and see if some crime could not be laid to his\r\ncharge; and if not, that, in any case, it was indispensable to make the\r\nprisoner--who, for some unknown reason, had been shorn of his offices,\r\ndignities, and decorations--pass under the judgment of Commissioners.\r\nNow, these Commissioners, as I have already stated, were Marshal\r\nBoutourline, the Procurator-General Prince Troubetskoy, the General\r\nCount Alexander Schouvaloff, and the Sieur Volkoff as Secretary. The\r\nfirst thing these Commissioners did was to give directions, through the\r\ndepartment of foreign affairs, to the ambassadors, envoys, and\r\n_employés_ of Russia at foreign courts, to send copies of the despatches\r\nwhich Count Bestoujeff had written to them since he had been at the head\r\nof affairs. The object of this was to discover in these despatches some\r\ncrime or other. It was alleged against him that he wrote just what he\r\npleased, and made statements opposed to the orders and wishes of the\r\nEmpress; but as her Majesty neither wrote nor signed anything, it was\r\ndifficult to act against her orders; and, as to verbal orders, she could\r\nhardly have given any to the High Chancellor, who for whole years had no\r\noccasion to see her; and, as for verbal orders delivered through a third\r\nparty, they might as easily be misapprehended, as they might be\r\nimperfectly delivered, as well as imperfectly received and understood.\r\nBut nothing came of all this except the order I have mentioned, because\r\nnone of the _employés_ gave himself the trouble of examining papers\r\nranging over twenty years, and then copying them for the purpose of\r\ndiscovering crimes committed by one whose instructions and orders he\r\nhimself had followed out, and with whom, therefore, however well meant\r\nhis efforts, he might become implicated in any faults which might be\r\ntraced in them. Besides, the mere transmission of these papers would put\r\nthe crown to a considerable expense; and when, after all, they reached\r\nSt. Petersburg, there would be enough in them to try the patience of\r\nmany persons for many years in their attempts to discover and unravel\r\nsomething which, after all, they might contain. The order therefore was\r\nnever executed; nay, even those who sent it at last grew tired of the\r\nbusiness itself, and at the end of a year it was concluded by the\r\npublication of the manifesto, which they had begun to compose the day\r\nafter the Chancellor's arrest.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day on which Stambke had come to take leave of\r\nme, the Empress sent an order to the Grand Duke to dismiss him, and send\r\nhim back to Holstein, for that his correspondence with Bestoujeff had\r\nbeen discovered, and that he deserved to be arrested, but that out of\r\nconsideration for his Imperial Highness, whose minister he was, he\r\nshould be left at liberty, provided he was immediately sent away.\r\nStambke was immediately sent off, and with his departure ended my\r\ninterference in the affairs of Holstein. The Grand Duke was given to\r\nunderstand that the Empress was not pleased at my having to meddle with\r\nthem, and his Imperial Highness was himself inclined that way. I do not\r\nwell remember who it was that succeeded Stambke, but I rather think it\r\nwas a person named Wolff. In the next place, the Empress' ministry\r\nformally demanded of the King of Poland, the recall of Count\r\nPoniatowsky, as a letter of his, addressed to Count Bestoujeff, had been\r\ndiscovered. It was innocent enough, in fact, but nevertheless was\r\naddressed to a so-called prisoner of state. As soon as I heard of the\r\ndismissal of Stambke, and the recall of Count Poniatowsky, I prepared\r\nmyself to expect nothing good, and this is what I did. I summoned my\r\nvalet de chambre, Skourine, and ordered him to collect and bring to me\r\nall my account books, and everything among my effects which could in any\r\nway be regarded as a paper. He executed my orders with zeal and\r\nexactitude, and when all were brought into my room I dismissed him. As\r\nsoon as he left the room, I threw all the books into the fire, and when\r\nI saw them half-consumed, I recalled Skourine, and said to him, \"Look\r\nhere, and be witness that all my papers and accounts are burnt, in order\r\nthat if you are ever asked where they are, you may be able to swear that\r\nyou saw me burn them.\" He thanked me for the care I took of him, and\r\ntold me that a singular alteration had been made in the guard over the\r\nprisoners. Since the discovery of Stambke's correspondence with Count\r\nBestoujeff, a stricter watch had been kept upon him, and with this\r\nobject they had taken from Bernardi the sergeant Kalichkine, and had\r\nplaced him in the chamber and near the person of the late High\r\nChancellor. When Kalichkine saw this, he asked to have some of the\r\ntrusty soldiers who were under him when he was on guard at Bernardi's.\r\nHere, then, was the most reliable and intelligent man we had introduced\r\ninto the very apartment of Count Bestoujeff, without having lost all\r\nmeans of communication with Bernardi. In the meantime the\r\ninterrogatories of the Count were going on. Kalichkine made himself\r\nknown to him as a man devoted to me, and, in fact, he rendered him a\r\nthousand good offices. Like myself, he was convinced that the Chancellor\r\nwas innocent, and the victim of a powerful cabal--and such, also, was\r\nthe persuasion of the public. As for the Grand Duke, I saw that they had\r\nfrightened him, and had led him to suspect that I was aware of the\r\ncorrespondence of Stambke with the state-prisoner. I perceived that his\r\nRoyal Highness was almost afraid to speak to me, and avoided entering my\r\napartment, where I remained for the time, quite alone, seeing no one. I\r\nwould not, in fact, allow any one to come to me, fearing to expose them\r\nto some misfortune or inconvenience, and when at court, in order to be\r\navoided, I refrained from approaching any one I thought likely to be\r\ncompromised by my notice. On the last days of the Carnival there was to\r\nbe a Russian play at the court theatre, and Count Poniatowsky begged me\r\nto be present, because rumours had been spread that it was intended to\r\nsend me back to my own country, to prevent my appearance in public, and\r\nI know not what besides, and that every time I did not appear at court\r\nor at the theatre, every one was anxious to know the reason of my\r\nabsence, as much perhaps from curiosity as from interest in me. I knew\r\nthat the Russian drama was one of the things his Imperial Highness least\r\nliked, and even to talk of going there was enough to displease him\r\nseriously. On this occasion, too, in addition to his dislike of the\r\nnational drama, he had another and more personal objection, namely, that\r\nit would deprive him of the company of the Countess Elizabeth Voronzoff;\r\nas she was in the ante-chamber along with the other maids of honour, it\r\nwas there that his Imperial Highness enjoyed her conversation or her\r\ncompany at play. If I went to the theatre these ladies were obliged to\r\nfollow me--a circumstance which annoyed his Imperial Highness, who had\r\nthen no other resource than to retire to his own apartments to drink.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, as I had promised to go to the play, I sent a\r\nmessage to Count Alexander Schouvaloff, desiring him to order a carriage\r\nfor me, as I intended that day to go to the play. The Count came and\r\ntold me that my intention of going to the theatre was anything but\r\nagreeable to the Grand Duke. I replied that as I formed no part of the\r\nsociety of his Royal Highness, I thought it would be the same to him\r\nwhether I was alone in my room or in my box at the theatre. He went\r\naway, winking his eyes, as he always did whenever anything disturbed\r\nhim. Some time afterwards, the Grand Duke came into my room. He was in a\r\nfearful passion, screaming like an eagle; accusing me of taking pleasure\r\nin enraging him, and saying that I had chosen to go to these plays\r\nbecause I knew he disliked them; but I represented to him that he ought\r\nnot to dislike them. He told me that he would forbid my having a\r\ncarriage. I replied that if he did I should go on foot, and that I could\r\nnot imagine what pleasure he could find in compelling me to die of\r\n_ennui_ in my rooms, with no other company but my dog and my parrot.\r\nAfter a long and very angry dispute on both sides, he went away, in a\r\ngreater rage than ever, and I still persisted in my intention of going\r\nto the play. When it got near the time for starting, I sent to ask Count\r\nSchouvaloff if the carriages were ready; he came and told me that the\r\nGrand Duke had forbidden any to be provided for me. Then I became really\r\nangry, and told him that I would go on foot, and that if he forbade the\r\nladies and gentlemen from attending me I would go alone; and, besides,\r\nthat I would write and complain to the Empress, both of the Duke and of\r\nhim. \"What will you say to her?\" he asked. \"I will tell her,\" I said,\r\n\"the manner in which I am treated, and that you, in order to secure for\r\nthe Grand Duke a rendezvous with my maids of honour, encourage him to\r\nprevent my going to the theatre, where I might, perhaps, have the\r\npleasure of seeing her Imperial Majesty; and besides this, I will beg of\r\nher to send me back to my mother, because I am weary of, and disgusted\r\nwith, the part I play here: left alone and deserted in my room, hated by\r\nthe Grand Duke, and not liked by the Empress, I want to be at rest, and\r\na burden to no one; I want to be freed from the necessity of making\r\nevery one who approaches me unhappy, and particularly my poor servants,\r\nof whom so many have been exiled, because I was kind to them, or wished\r\nto be so. It is thus that I shall write to her Imperial Majesty, and I\r\nwill see, moreover, whether you yourself will not be the bearer of my\r\nletter.\" My gentleman got frightened at the determined tone I assumed;\r\nhe left me, and I sat down to write my letter to the Empress in Russian,\r\nmaking it as pathetic as I could. I began by thanking her for the\r\nkindness and favours with which she had loaded me ever since my arrival\r\nin Russia, saying that, unfortunately, the event proved that I did not\r\ndeserve them, since I had only drawn upon myself the hatred of the Grand\r\nDuke and the very marked displeasure of her Imperial Majesty; that as I\r\nwas unhappy and shut up in my own room, where I was deprived of even the\r\nmost innocent amusements, I begged her earnestly to put an end to my\r\nsufferings, by sending me to my relations in any manner she judged\r\nproper; that as for the children, as I never saw them, though living in\r\nthe same house with them, it made little difference to me whether I was\r\nin the same place with them or some hundreds of leagues distant; that I\r\nwas well aware that she took better care of them than my poor powers\r\nwould enable me to do; that I ventured to entreat her to continue this\r\ncare of them; that confident of this, I would pass the rest of my time\r\nwith my relations, in praying for her, the Grand Duke, my children, and\r\nall those who had done me either good or evil; but that my health was\r\nreduced by grief to such a state, that I did what I could to preserve my\r\nlife, at least; and that with this object I addressed myself to her for\r\npermission to go to the waters, and thence to my relations.\r\n\r\nHaving written this letter, I summoned Count Schouvaloff, who, on\r\nentering, informed me that the carriages I had ordered were ready. I\r\ntold him, while handing him my letter for the Empress, that he might\r\ninform the gentlemen and ladies who did not wish to accompany me to the\r\ntheatre, that I would dispense with their attendance. The Count received\r\nmy letter, winking his usual wink, but as it was addressed to her\r\nImperial Majesty, he dared not refuse it. He also gave my message to the\r\nequerries and ladies, and it was his Imperial Highness who decided who\r\nwas to go with me, and who was to remain with him. I passed through the\r\nante-chamber, where I found him seated with the Countess Voronzoff,\r\nplaying at cards in a corner. He rose, and she also, when he saw me--a\r\nthing which, on other occasions, he never did. In this ceremony I\r\nreplied by a low curtsey, and passed on. I went to the theatre, where\r\nthe Empress did not come on that occasion. I fancy it was my letter\r\nwhich prevented her. On my return, Count Schouvaloff told me that her\r\nImperial Majesty would have an interview with me herself. The Count\r\nwould seem to have informed the Grand Duke of my letter and the reply of\r\nthe Empress, for, although from that time he never set foot in my room,\r\nhe used his utmost endeavours to be present at the interview which the\r\nEmpress was to have with me, and it was considered that this could not\r\nwell be refused. While waiting for this interview to take place, I kept\r\nmyself quiet, in my own apartments. I felt persuaded that if the\r\nSchouvaloffs had had any idea of sending me home, or of frightening me\r\nwith the threats of doing so, I had taken the best method of\r\ndisconcerting the project; for nowhere were they likely to meet with\r\ngreater resistance to it than in the mind of the Empress herself, who\r\nwas not at all inclined to strong measures of this kind; besides, she\r\nremembered the old misunderstandings in her own family, and certainly\r\nwould not wish to see them renewed in her time. Against me there could\r\nbe only one point of complaint, which was, that her worthy nephew did\r\nnot appear to me the most amiable of men, any more than I appeared to\r\nhim the most amiable of women; and, as regarded this nephew, her\r\nopinions exactly coincided with my own. She knew him so well that for\r\nmany years past she could not spend a quarter of an hour in his society\r\nwithout feeling disgust, or anger, or sorrow, and in her chamber, when\r\nhe happened to be the subject of conversation, she would either melt\r\ninto tears at the misfortune of having such a successor, or she would be\r\nunable to speak of him without exhibiting her contempt, and often\r\napplied to him epithets which he but too well merited. I have proofs of\r\nthis in my hands, having found among her papers two notes written by her\r\nown hand, to whom I do not know, though one of them appears to have been\r\nfor John Schouvaloff, and the other for Count Rasoumowsky, in which she\r\ncurses her nephew, and wishes him at the devil. In one occurs this\r\nexpression, \"_My damned nephew has greatly vexed me_;\" and in another\r\nshe says, \"_My nephew is a fool, the devil take him_.\" Besides, my mind\r\nwas made up, and I looked upon my being sent away, or not, with a very\r\nphilosophic eye. In whatever position it should please Providence to\r\nplace me, I should never be without those resources which talent and\r\ndetermination give to each one according to his natural abilities, and I\r\nfelt myself possessed of sufficient courage either to mount or descend\r\nwithout being carried away by undue pride on the one hand, or being\r\nhumbled and dispirited on the other. I knew that I was a human being,\r\nand, therefore, of limited powers, and then incapable of perfection,\r\nbut my intentions had always been pure and good. If from the very\r\nbeginning I had perceived that to love a husband who was not amiable,\r\nnor took any pains to be so, was a thing difficult, if not impossible;\r\nyet, at least, I had devoted myself both to him and his interests with\r\nall the attachment which a friend, and even a servant, could devote to\r\nhis friend and master. My counsel to him had always been the very best I\r\ncould devise for his welfare, and, if he did not choose to follow it,\r\nthe fault was not mine, but that of his own judgment, which was neither\r\nsound nor just. When I came to Russia, and during the first years of our\r\nunion, had this Prince shown the least disposition to make himself\r\nsupportable, my heart would have been opened for him, but when I saw\r\nthat of all possible objects I was the one to whom he showed the least\r\npossible attention, precisely because I was his wife, it is not\r\nwonderful I should find my position neither agreeable nor to my taste,\r\nor that I should consider it irksome, or even painful. This latter\r\nfeeling I suppressed more resolutely than any other; the pride and cast\r\nof my disposition rendered the idea of being unhappy most repugnant to\r\nme. I used to say to myself, happiness and misery depend on ourselves;\r\nif you feel unhappy, raise yourself above unhappiness, and so act that\r\nyour happiness may be independent of all eventualities. With such a\r\ndisposition I was born with a great sensibility, and a face, to say the\r\nleast of it, interesting, and which pleased at first sight, without art\r\nor effort. My disposition was naturally so conciliating, that no one\r\never passed a quarter of an hour in my company without feeling perfectly\r\nat ease, and conversing with me as if we had been old acquaintances.\r\nNaturally indulgent, I won the confidence of those who had any relations\r\nwith me, because every one felt that the strictest probity and\r\ngood-will were the impulses which I most readily obeyed, and, if I may\r\nbe allowed the expression, I venture to assert, in my own behalf, that I\r\nwas a true gentleman, whose cast of mind was more male than female,\r\nthough, for all that, I was anything but masculine, for, joined to the\r\nmind and character of a man, I possessed the charms of a very agreeable\r\nwoman. I trust I shall be pardoned for giving this candid expression of\r\nmy feelings, instead of seeking to throw around them a veil of false\r\nmodesty. Besides, this very writing must prove what I have asserted of\r\nmind, disposition, and character.\r\n\r\nI have just said that I was pleasing, consequently half the road of\r\ntemptation was already traversed, and it is in the very essence of human\r\nnature that, in such cases, the other half should not remain untracked.\r\nFor to tempt, and to be tempted, are things very nearly allied, and, in\r\nspite of the finest maxims of morality impressed upon the mind, whenever\r\nfeeling has anything to do in the matter, no sooner is it excited than\r\nwe have already gone vastly farther than we are aware of, and I have yet\r\nto learn how it is possible to prevent its being excited. Flight alone\r\nis, perhaps, the only remedy; but there are cases and circumstances in\r\nwhich flight becomes impossible, for how is it possible to fly, shun, or\r\nturn one's back in the midst of a court? The very attempt would give\r\nrise to remarks. Now, if you do not fly, there is nothing, it seems to\r\nme, so difficult as to escape from that which is essentially agreeable.\r\nAll that can be said in opposition to it will appear but a prudery quite\r\nout of harmony with the natural instincts of the human heart; besides,\r\nno one holds his heart in his hand, tightening or relaxing his grasp of\r\nit at pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my narrative. The morning after the play, I gave out\r\nthat I was unwell, and kept my room, waiting patiently for the decision\r\nof her Imperial Majesty upon my humble request. However, the first week\r\nin Lent I judged it prudent to go to my duty, in order to show my\r\nattachment to the Orthodox Church. The second or third week of Lent\r\nbrought me another bitter affliction. One morning after I had risen, my\r\nservants informed me that Count Alexander Schouvaloff had sent for\r\nMadame Vladislava. This I thought somewhat strange. I waited her return\r\nanxiously, but in vain. About an hour after noon, Count Schouvaloff came\r\nto apprise me that her Majesty the Empress had thought fit to remove\r\nMadame Vladislava from me. I burst into tears, and said, that of course,\r\nher Imperial Majesty had a right to remove or place with me whomsoever\r\nshe pleased, but that I was grieved to find, more and more, that all who\r\ncame near me were so many victims devoted to the displeasure of her\r\nImperial Majesty; and that in order that there might be fewer such\r\nvictims, I begged and entreated him to request her Majesty to send me\r\nhome to my relations as soon as possible, and thus put an end to a state\r\nof things which compelled me to be continually making some one or other\r\nmiserable. I also assured him that the removal of Madame Vladislava\r\nwould not serve to throw any light upon anything whatever, because,\r\nneither she nor any one else possessed any confidence. The Count was\r\nabout to reply, but hearing my sobs, he began to weep with me, and told\r\nme that the Empress would herself speak to me on the subject. I\r\nentreated him to hasten the moment, which he promised to do. I then went\r\nto my attendants, related what had occurred, and added that if any\r\nduenna I happened to dislike took the place of Madame Vladislava, she\r\nmight make up her mind to receive from me the worst possible treatment,\r\nnot even excepting blows; and I begged them to repeat this wherever they\r\npleased, so as to deter all who might wish to be placed about me from\r\nbeing in too great haste to accept the charge, for that I was tired of\r\nsuffering, and as I saw that my mildness and patience had produced no\r\nother result than that of making everything connected with me go from\r\nbad to worse, I had made up my mind to change my conduct entirely. My\r\npeople did not fail to repeat all I wished.\r\n\r\nThe evening of this day, during which I had wept a great deal, walking\r\nup and down my room, much agitated both in mind and body, one of my\r\nmaids, named Catherine Ivanovna Cheregorodskaya, came into my bed-room,\r\nwhere I was quite alone, and said to me very affectionately, and with\r\nmany tears, \"We are all very much afraid you will sink under these\r\nafflictions; let me go to-day to my uncle--he is your own confessor as\r\nwell as the Empress'--I will talk to him, and tell him everything you\r\nwish, and I promise you he will speak to the Empress in a manner that\r\nwill give you satisfaction.\" Perceiving her good disposition towards me,\r\nI told her without reserve the state of matters; what I had written to\r\nher Imperial Majesty, and everything else. She went to her uncle, and,\r\nhaving talked the matter over, and disposed him to favour my cause, she\r\nreturned about eleven o'clock to tell me that her uncle advised me to\r\ngive out in the course of the night that I was ill, and wanted to\r\nconfess, and thus send for him, in order that he might be able to repeat\r\nto the Empress what he should hear from my own lips. I very much\r\napproved of this idea, and promised to carry it out, and then dismissed\r\nher, thanking both herself and uncle for the attachment they displayed\r\nfor me. Accordingly, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I\r\nrang my bell. One of my women entered. I told her I felt so unwell that\r\nI wished to confess. In place of a confessor, Count Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff came running to me. In a weak and broken voice I renewed my\r\nrequest that my confessor should be sent to me. He sent for the doctors,\r\nand to these I said that it was spiritual succour I stood in need of;\r\nthat I was choking. One felt my pulse, and said it was weak; I replied\r\nthat my soul was in danger, and that my body had no further need of\r\ndoctors. At length my confessor arrived, and we were left alone. I made\r\nhim sit by the side of my bed, and we had a conversation of at least an\r\nhour and a-half in length. I described to him the state of things past\r\nand present; the Grand Duke's conduct to me, and mine towards him; the\r\nhatred of the Schouvaloffs, and the constant banishment, or dismissal,\r\nof my people, and always of those who had grown most attached to me,\r\nand, finally, the hatred of her Imperial Majesty, drawn upon me by the\r\nSchouvaloffs; in short, the whole present position of affairs, and what\r\nhad led me to write to the Empress the letter in which I demanded to be\r\nsent home, and I begged him to procure me a speedy reply to my prayer. I\r\nfound him with the best disposition possible for serving me, and by no\r\nmeans such a fool as he was reported to be. He told me that my letter\r\ndid and would produce the effect I wished; that I must persist in my\r\ndemand to be sent home, a demand which most certainly would not be\r\ncomplied with, because such a step could not be justified in the eyes of\r\nthe public, who had their attention directed towards me. He agreed that\r\nI had been treated very cruelly; that the Empress, having chosen me at a\r\nvery tender age, had abandoned me to the mercy of my enemies; and that\r\nshe would do far better to banish my rivals, and especially Elizabeth\r\nVoronzoff, and keep a check upon her favourites, who had become the\r\nblood-suckers of the people, by means of the new monopolies which the\r\nSchouvaloffs were every day devising, besides which, they were daily\r\ngiving the people cause to complain of their injustice, as witness the\r\naffair of Count Bestoujeff, of whose innocence the public were\r\npersuaded. He concluded by telling me that he would immediately proceed\r\nto the Empress' apartments, where he would wait until she awoke, in\r\norder to speak to her on the subject; and that he would then press for\r\nthe interview which she had promised me, and which ought to be decisive;\r\nand that I would do well to keep my bed: he would add, he said, that\r\ngrief and affliction might cause my death, if some speedy remedy were\r\nnot applied, and I was not removed, by some means or other, from my\r\npresent condition where I was left, alone and abandoned by every one. He\r\nkept his word, and painted so vividly to the Empress my unfortunate\r\nstate, that she summoned Count Alexander Schouvaloff, and ordered him to\r\ninquire if my condition would allow me to come and speak to her the\r\nfollowing evening. Count Schouvaloff came to me with this message, and I\r\ntold him for such an object I would summon all the strength I had left.\r\nTowards evening I rose, and Schouvaloff informed me that, after\r\nmidnight, he would accompany me to the apartments of her Imperial\r\nMajesty. My confessor sent me word by his niece, that everything was\r\ngoing on well, and that the Empress would speak to me that evening. I\r\ntherefore dressed myself about ten o'clock at night, and lay down fully\r\ndressed upon a couch, where I fell asleep. About half-past one, Count\r\nSchouvaloff entered the apartment, and told me that the Empress had\r\nasked for me. I arose, and followed him. We passed through several\r\nante-chambers, entirely empty, and on arriving at the door of the\r\ngallery, I saw the Grand Duke enter by the opposite door, and perceived\r\nthat he too was about to visit the Empress. I had never seen him since\r\nthe day of the play; even when I had given out that my life was in\r\ndanger, he neither came nor sent to inquire after my health. I\r\nafterwards learned that on this very day he had promised Elizabeth\r\nVoronzoff to marry her if I happened to die, and that both were\r\nrejoicing greatly at my condition.\r\n\r\nHaving at last reached her Imperial Majesty's room, I there found the\r\nGrand Duke. As soon as I perceived the Empress, I threw myself at her\r\nfeet, and begged her earnestly, and with tears, to send me back to my\r\nrelations. The Empress wished to raise me, but I remained at her feet;\r\nshe appeared more grieved than angry, and said to me, with tears in her\r\neyes, \"Why do you wish me to send you home? Do you not remember that you\r\nhave children?\" I replied, \"My children are in your Majesty's hands, and\r\ncannot be better placed, and I trust that you will not abandon them.\"\r\nShe then said to me, \"But what excuse should I give to the public in\r\njustification of this step?\" \"Your Imperial Majesty,\" I replied, \"will\r\nstate, if you think fit, the causes which have brought upon me your\r\nMajesty's displeasure, and the hatred of the Grand Duke.\" \"But how will\r\nyou manage to live when you are with your relatives?\" I replied, \"As I\r\ndid before your Majesty did me the honour of bringing me here.\" To this\r\nshe answered, \"Your mother is a fugitive; she has been compelled to\r\nretire, and has gone to Paris.\" \"I am aware of this,\" I said; \"she was\r\nthought to be too much attached to the interests of Russia, and the King\r\nof Prussia has therefore persecuted her.\" The Empress again bid me rise,\r\nwhich I did, and she walked away from me to some distance, musing.\r\n\r\nThe apartment in which we were was long, and had three windows between\r\nwhich stood two tables, containing the gold toilet-service of the\r\nEmpress. No one was in the room but myself, the Empress, the Grand Duke,\r\nand Alexander Schouvaloff. Opposite the Empress were some large screens,\r\nin front of which was a couch. I suspected from the first that John\r\nSchouvaloff certainly, and perhaps also his cousin Peter, were behind\r\nthese. I learnt afterwards that my conjecture was in part correct, and\r\nthat John Schouvaloff actually was there. I stood by the side of the\r\ntoilet-table, nearest to the door by which I entered, and noticed in the\r\ntoilet-basin some letters folded up. The Empress again approached me,\r\nand said, \"God is my witness how I wept when you were dangerously ill,\r\njust after your arrival in Russia. If I had not liked you, I should not\r\nhave kept you.\" This I looked upon as an answer to what I had just said\r\nin reference to my having incurred her displeasure. I replied by\r\nthanking her Majesty for all the kindness and favour she had shown me\r\nthen and since, saying that the recollection of them would never be\r\neffaced from my memory, and that I should always regard my having\r\nincurred her displeasure as the greatest of my misfortunes. She then\r\ndrew still nearer to me, and said, \"You are dreadfully haughty: do you\r\nremember, that at the Summer Palace, I one day approached you, and asked\r\nif you had a stiff neck, because I noticed that you hardly bowed to me,\r\nand that it was from pride you merely saluted me with a nod.\" \"Gracious\r\nheavens! madame,\" I said, \"how could your Majesty possibly suppose that\r\nI should be haughty to you? I solemnly declare that it never once\r\noccurred to me that this question, asked four years ago, could have\r\nreference to any such thing.\" Upon this she said, \"You fancy there is no\r\none so clever as yourself.\" \"If I ever had any such conceit,\" I\r\nreplied, \"nothing could be better calculated to undeceive me than my\r\npresent condition and this very conversation, since I see that I have\r\nbeen stupid enough not to understand, till this moment, what you were\r\npleased to say to me four years ago.\" During my conversation with her\r\nMajesty, the Grand Duke was whispering to Count Schouvaloff. She\r\nperceived this, and went over to them. They were both standing near the\r\nmiddle of the room. I could not very well hear what they were saying, as\r\nthey did not speak loud, and the room was large. At last I heard the\r\nGrand Duke raise his voice and say, \"She is dreadfully spiteful, and\r\nvery obstinate.\" I then perceived they were talking about me, and,\r\naddressing the Grand Duke, I observed, \"If it is of me you are speaking,\r\nI am very glad to have this opportunity of telling you, in the presence\r\nof her Imperial Majesty, that I am indeed spiteful to those who advise\r\nyou to commit injustice, and that I have become obstinate because I see\r\nthat I have gained nothing by yielding, but your hostility.\" He\r\nimmediately retorted, \"Your Majesty can see how malicious she is by what\r\nshe says herself.\" But my words made a very different impression on the\r\nEmpress, who had infinitely more intellect than the Grand Duke. I could\r\nplainly see as the conversation progressed, that although she had been\r\nrecommended, or had herself, perhaps, resolved to treat me with\r\nseverity, her feelings softened by degrees in spite of herself and her\r\nresolutions. She, however, turned towards him, and said, \"Oh, you do not\r\nknow all she has told me against your advisers, and against Brockdorff,\r\nrelative to the man you have had arrested.\" This must naturally have\r\nappeared to the Duke a formal treason on my part. He did not know a word\r\nof my conversation with the Empress, at the Summer Palace, and he saw\r\nhis dear Brockdorff, who had become so precious in his eyes, accused to\r\nher Majesty, and that by me. This, therefore, was to put us on worse\r\nterms than ever, and perhaps render us irreconcilable, as well as\r\ndeprive me, for the future, of all share in his confidence. I was\r\nthunderstruck when I heard her relating to him, in my presence, what I\r\nhad told her, and, as I believed, for his own good, and found it thus\r\nturned against me like a weapon of destruction. The Grand Duke, very\r\nmuch astonished at this disclosure, said, \"Ah! here is an anecdote quite\r\nnew to me; it is very interesting, and proves her spitefulness.\" I\r\nthought to myself, \"God knows whose spitefulness it proves.\" From\r\nBrockdorff her Majesty passed abruptly to the connection discovered\r\nbetween Stambke and Count Bestoujeff, and said to me, \"I leave you to\r\nimagine how it is possible to excuse him for having held communication\r\nwith a state-prisoner.\" As my name had not appeared in this affair, I\r\nwas silent, as if the matter did not concern me. Upon which the Empress\r\napproached me, and said, \"You meddle with many things which do not\r\nconcern you. I should not have dared to have done so in the time of the\r\nEmpress Anne. How, for instance, could you presume to send orders to\r\nMarshal Apraxine?\" I replied, \"I, madame? Never has such an idea entered\r\nmy head.\" \"What!\" she said, \"will you deny having written to him? There\r\nare your letters in that basin,\" and she pointed to them as she spoke.\r\n\"You are forbidden to write.\" \"True,\" I replied, \"I have transgressed in\r\nthis respect, and I beg your pardon for it; but since my letters are\r\nthere, these three letters will prove to your Imperial Majesty that I\r\nhave never sent him any orders; but that in one of them I informed him\r\nof what was said of his conduct.\" Here she interrupted me by saying,\r\n\"And why did you write this to him?\" I replied simply, \"Because I took a\r\ngreat interest in the Marshal, whom I like very much. I begged him to\r\nfollow your orders. Of the two other letters, one contains only my\r\ncongratulations on the birth of his son; and in the other I merely\r\npresented to him the compliments of the new-year.\" Upon this she said,\r\n\"Bestoujeff asserts that there were many others.\" I replied, \"If\r\nBestoujeff says that, he lies.\" \"Very well, then,\" she said, \"since he\r\nhas told lies concerning you, I will have him put to the torture.\" She\r\nthought by this to frighten me, but I answered that she could, of\r\ncourse, act according to her sovereign pleasure, but that I had never\r\nwritten more than those three letters to Apraxine. She was silent, and\r\nappeared to be meditating.\r\n\r\nI relate the most salient points of this conversation which have\r\nremained in my memory; but it would be impossible for me to recollect\r\nall that was said in the course of an interview which lasted an hour and\r\na-half at the least. The Empress walked to and fro in the apartment,\r\nsometimes addressing herself to me, sometimes to her nephew, but more\r\nfrequently to Count Alexander Schouvaloff, with whom the Grand Duke\r\nconversed the greater part of the time, while the Empress was speaking\r\nto me. I have already said that I remarked in her Majesty's manner less\r\nof anger than of anxiety. As to the Grand Duke, during the whole\r\ninterview he manifested much bitterness, animosity, and even passion\r\ntowards me. He endeavoured as much as he could to excite the anger of\r\nher Majesty against me, but as he did it so stupidly, and displayed more\r\nanger than justice, he failed in his object, and the penetration and\r\nsagacity of the Empress disposed her rather to take my part. She\r\nlistened, with marked attention and a kind of involuntary approval, to\r\nmy firm and temperate replies to my husband's outrageous statements,\r\nfrom which it was perfectly evident that his object was to clear out my\r\nplace, in order to establish in it the favourite of the moment. But this\r\nmight not be to the Empress' liking, neither might it suit the fancy of\r\nthe Messrs. Schouvaloff to give themselves Count Voronzoff for a master;\r\nbut all this transcended the judicial penetration of his Imperial\r\nHighness, who always believed in what he wished, and never would listen\r\nto anything which appeared the dominant idea of the moment; and on this\r\noccasion he dwelt so much upon it that the Empress approached me and\r\nsaid, in a low voice, \"I have many other things to say to you, but I do\r\nnot wish you to be embroiled more than you are already.\" And with a look\r\nand a movement of her head, she intimated that it was on account of the\r\npresence of the others that she would not speak. Perceiving this mark of\r\nsincere good-will at so critical a moment, my heart was moved, and I\r\nsaid to her, in a similar tone, \"And I also am prevented from speaking,\r\nhowever earnest my desire to open to you my mind and heart.\" I saw that\r\nthis made a favourable impression on her. Tears came into her eyes, and\r\nto conceal her emotion, and the extent to which she was moved, she\r\ndismissed us, observing that it was very late; and, in fact, it was\r\nnearly three o'clock in the morning. The Grand Duke went out first, I\r\nfollowed, and just as Alexander Schouvaloff was passing out after me,\r\nher Majesty called him back, and he remained with her. The Grand Duke\r\nstrode on rapidly, as usual, but on this occasion I did not hurry myself\r\nto follow him. He entered his apartments, and I mine. I was beginning to\r\nundress, in order to go to bed, when I heard some one knocking at the\r\ndoor by which I had entered. On asking who was there, Schouvaloff\r\nreplied that it was he, and begged me to admit him, which I did. He\r\ndesired me to dismiss my maids. They left the room. He then told me that\r\nthe Empress had called him back, and that, after talking to him for some\r\ntime, she had charged him to bear to me her compliments, and to tell me\r\nnot to distress myself, and that she would have another conversation\r\nwith me quite alone. I made a low bow to the Count, and begged him to\r\npresent my most humble respects to her Imperial Majesty, and thank her\r\nfor her kindness, which had restored me to life. I told him that I\r\nshould look forward to this second interview with the utmost impatience,\r\nand entreated him to hasten its time. He requested me not to speak of it\r\nto any one whatever, especially the Grand Duke, who, her Majesty saw,\r\nwith regret, was greatly irritated against me. This I promised; though I\r\ncould not help thinking to myself, \"But if she regrets his irritation,\r\nwhy increase it by repeating our conversation at the Summer Palace,\r\nconcerning those people whose society was brutalizing him?\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected restoration of the favour and confidence of the Empress,\r\ngave me, however, great pleasure. The next day I desired my confessor's\r\nniece to thank her uncle from me, for the signal service he had rendered\r\nme, by procuring for me this interview with her Majesty. On her return\r\nshe told me that her uncle had heard that the Empress had called her\r\nnephew a fool, but said that the Grand Duchess had a great deal of\r\nsense. This remark came to me from more quarters than one, as well as\r\nthat her Majesty, among her intimate associates, was constantly\r\nextolling my talents, often adding, \"She loves truth and justice; she is\r\na woman of great sense; but my nephew is a fool.\"\r\n\r\nI still continued to keep my room, as before, under the pretext of bad\r\nhealth. I recollect that I read at this time, with the map before me,\r\nthe first five volumes of the \"Histoire des Voyages,\" and that I was\r\nboth amused and instructed by the perusal. When tired of these, I turned\r\nover the early volumes of the \"Encyclopedia,\" while waiting until it\r\nshould please her Majesty to admit me to a second interview. I renewed,\r\nfrom time to time, my request to Count Schouvaloff, telling him that I\r\nwas very anxious to have my destiny decided. As to the Grand Duke, I\r\nheard nothing more about him. I only knew that he was impatiently\r\nwaiting for my dismissal, and that he confidently calculated on\r\nafterwards marrying Elizabeth Voronzoff. She came into his apartments,\r\nand already did the honours there. It appeared that her uncle, the\r\nVice-Chancellor, who was a hypocrite, if ever there was one, had become\r\naware of the projects of his brother, perhaps, or rather, it may be, of\r\nhis nephews, who were then very young, the eldest being only twenty, or\r\nthereabouts, and fearing that his newly-revived credit with her Majesty\r\nmight suffer by it, he intrigued for the commission of dissuading me\r\nfrom demanding my dismissal; for this is what occurred.\r\n\r\nOne morning, it was announced to me, that the Vice-Chancellor Count\r\nVoronzoff requested to speak to me on the part of the Empress. Surprised\r\nat this extraordinary deputation, I ordered him to be admitted, though I\r\nwas not yet dressed. He began by kissing my hand, and pressing it\r\nwarmly, and then wiped his eyes, from which a few tears fell. As I was a\r\nlittle prejudiced against him at that time, I did not put much faith in\r\nthis preamble, by which he intended to show his zeal, but allowed him to\r\ngo on with what I looked upon as a piece of buffoonery. I begged him to\r\nbe seated. He was a little out of breath, owing to a species of goitre\r\nwhich troubled him. He sat down by me, and told me that the Empress had\r\ncharged him to speak to me, and dissuade me from insisting on my\r\ndismissal; that her Majesty had even gone so far as to authorize him to\r\nbeg me, in her name, to renounce a wish to which she never would give\r\nher consent, and that for his own part, especially, he conjured me to\r\npromise him that I would never speak of it again; adding that the\r\nproject was a source of great grief to the Empress, and to all good men,\r\namong whom, he begged to include himself. I replied that there was\r\nnothing I would not willingly do to please her Majesty, and satisfy good\r\nmen; but that I believed my health and life were endangered by my\r\npresent mode of existence, and the treatment to which I was exposed;\r\nthat I made everybody miserable; that all who came near me were either\r\ndriven into exile or dismissed; that the Grand Duke was embittered\r\nagainst me even to hatred, and that, besides, he had never loved me;\r\nthat her Imperial Majesty had shown me almost unceasing marks of her\r\ndispleasure, and that seeing myself a burden to everybody, and nearly\r\nworn out with ennui and grief, I had asked to be sent back to my home,\r\nin order to free them all from the presence of so troublesome a\r\npersonage. He spoke to me about my children; I told him I never saw\r\nthem, and that I had not seen the youngest since my confinement, nor\r\ncould I see them without an express permission from the Empress, as\r\ntheir apartment was only two rooms distant from her own, and formed part\r\nof her suite; that I had not the least doubt she took great care of\r\nthem, but that being deprived of the pleasure of seeing them, it was a\r\nmatter of indifference to me whether I was a hundred yards or a hundred\r\nleagues away from them. He informed me that the Empress would have a\r\nsecond conversation with me, and that it was greatly to be desired that\r\nher Majesty should become reconciled to me. To this I replied by begging\r\nhim to accelerate this second interview, and that I for my part would\r\nneglect nothing that could tend to realize his wishes. He remained more\r\nthan an hour with me, and spoke at great length upon a multitude of\r\nthings. I remarked that the increase of his influence had given him a\r\ncertain advantage in speech and deportment which he did not formerly\r\npossess when I saw him in the crowd; and when discontented with the\r\nEmpress, with the state of affairs, and with those who possessed her\r\nconfidence and favour, he said to me one day at court, seeing the\r\nEmpress speaking for a long time to the Austrian Ambassador, while he\r\nand I, and all besides, were kept standing, and tired to death, \"What\r\nwill you wager that she is not talking mere fiddle-faddle to him?\" \"Good\r\nheavens!\" I replied laughing, \"what is it you say?\" He answered me in\r\nRussian, in the characteristic words, \"She is by nature....\"[13] At\r\nlength he left me, assuring me of his zeal, and took his leave, again\r\nkissing my hand.\r\n\r\nFor the present, then, I might feel sure of not being sent home, since I\r\nwas requested not even to speak of it; but I deemed it as well not to\r\nquit my room, and to continue there as if I did not expect my fate to be\r\nfinally decided until the second audience which the Empress was to give.\r\nFor this I had to wait a long time. I remember that on the 21st of\r\nApril, 1759, my birth-day, I never went out. The Empress, at her\r\ndinner-hour, sent me word by Count Alexander Schouvaloff that she drank\r\nto my health. I requested my thanks to be given to her for her kind\r\nremembrance of me upon this day of my unhappy birth, which, I added, I\r\nwould curse, were it not also the day of my baptism. When the Grand Duke\r\nlearned that the Empress had sent this message to me, he took it into\r\nhis head to do the same. When his message was announced to me, I rose,\r\nand with a low courtesy expressed my thanks.\r\n\r\nAfter the _fêtes_ in honour of my birth-day, and of the Empress'\r\ncoronation day, which occurred within four days of each other, I still\r\nremained in my chamber, and never went out until Count Poniatowsky sent\r\nme word that the French Ambassador, the Marquis de l'Hôpital, had been\r\neulogizing the firmness of my conduct, and observed that the resolution\r\nI maintained of never leaving my room could not but be productive of\r\nadvantage to me. Taking this speech as the treacherous praise of an\r\nenemy, I determined to do exactly the contrary to what he advised; and,\r\none Sunday, when it was least expected, I dressed, and came out of my\r\nprivate room. The moment I entered the apartment occupied by the ladies\r\nand gentlemen in waiting, I remarked their astonishment at seeing me.\r\nSome minutes after my appearance, the Grand Duke also entered. He looked\r\nequally astonished, and, while I was conversing with the company, he\r\njoined in the conversation, and addressed some remarks to me, to which I\r\ncivilly replied.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Prince Charles of Saxony paid a second visit to St.\r\nPetersburg. The Grand Duke had treated him cavalierly enough on the\r\nfirst occasion, but this time his Imperial Highness thought himself\r\njustified in observing no terms with him, and for this reason: It was no\r\nsecret in the Russian army that in the battle of Zorndorf Prince Charles\r\nhad been one of the first to fly; and it was even asserted that he had\r\nfled without once stopping until he reached Landsberg. Now his Imperial\r\nHighness having heard this, resolved that, as a proved coward, he would\r\nnot speak to him, nor have anything to do with him. There was every\r\nreason to believe that the Princess of Courland, daughter of Biren, did\r\nnot a little contribute to this; for it had already begun to be\r\nwhispered that there was an intention of making Prince Charles Duke of\r\nCourland. The father of the Princess of Courland was constantly retained\r\nat Yaroslav. She communicated her hostility to the Grand Duke, over whom\r\nshe had always contrived to retain a kind of ascendancy. She was then\r\nengaged for the third time to Baron Alexander Tcherkassoff, to whom she\r\nwas married the winter following.\r\n\r\nAt last, a few days before our going into the country, Count Alexander\r\nSchouvaloff came to inform me, on the part of the Empress, that I was to\r\nask this afternoon, through him, permission to visit my children, and\r\nthat then, upon my leaving them, I should have that second audience with\r\nher Majesty which had been so long promised. I did as I was directed,\r\nand, in presence of a number of people, I begged Count Schouvaloff to\r\nask her Majesty's permission for me to see my children. He went away,\r\nand on his return told me that I could see them at three o'clock. I was\r\npunctual to the time, and remained with my children until Count\r\nSchouvaloff came to tell me that her Imperial Majesty could be seen. I\r\nwent to her, and found her quite alone, and this time there were no\r\nscreens in the room, and consequently we were able to speak freely. I\r\nbegan by thanking her for the audience she gave me, saying that her\r\ngracious promise of it had restored me to life. Upon which she said, \"I\r\nexpect you to reply with sincerity to all the questions that I may put\r\nto you.\" I assured her that she should hear nothing but the strict truth\r\nfrom me, and that there was nothing I desired more than to open my heart\r\nto her without reserve. Then she again asked if there really had been no\r\nmore than three letters written to Apraxine. I solemnly assured her, and\r\nwith perfect truth, that such was the fact. Then she asked me for\r\ndetails concerning the Grand Duke's mode of life....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF THE GRAND DUKE PETER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following letters, by the Grand Duke Peter, were discovered at\r\nMoscow about a year ago, and have been communicated by M. A. Herzen. We\r\ntake them from the second edition of these Memoirs, just issued, where\r\nthey appear in print for the first time. They are curious and\r\ninteresting, as illustrative of the defective education and low mental\r\ncondition of the writer, but it would be impossible to translate them\r\nwithout depriving them of the very peculiarities which give them this\r\nvalue; for to attempt to represent, by English equivalents, their\r\ndefects of style, and their grammatical and orthographical blunders,\r\nwould be simply to produce a ridiculous travesty.

My uncle, Prince George, had the order retracted,\r\nand it was only from this time that I listened to the proposals which\r\nhad been made to me since the death of the Empress Elizabeth. It was\r\nintended to seize him in his room, and imprison him, as had formerly\r\nbeen done in the case of the Princess Anne and her children. He went to\r\nOranienbaum. We had in our interest a great number of captains in the\r\nregiments of the guards. The fate of the secret was in the hands of the\r\nthree brothers Orloff, the elder of whom Osten remembers to have seen\r\nfollowing me everywhere, and perpetrating a thousand follies; his\r\npassion for me was notorious, and everything he has done has been\r\ninspired by it. All three are men of great determination, and very much\r\nbeloved by the soldiery, as they have served in the guards. I am under\r\nthe greatest obligations to them, as all St. Petersburg can bear\r\nwitness. The minds of the guards were prepared, and, towards the end,\r\nsome thirty or forty officers and nearly ten thousand men were in the\r\nsecret. In this number there was not a single traitor during the space\r\nof three weeks. There were four distinct parties, the chiefs of which\r\nwere united for the execution, and the true secret was in the hands of\r\nthe three brothers. Panin wished to have it in favour of my son, but\r\nthey would not listen to this. I was at Peterhoff; Peter III was\r\nresiding and carousing at Oranienbaum. It had been agreed that, in case\r\nof treason, they would not await his return, but at once assemble the\r\nguards and proclaim me. Their zeal for me did what treason would have\r\neffected. A report was spread on the 27th that I had been arrested. The\r\nsoldiers became excited; one of our officers quieted them. Then came a\r\nsoldier to a captain, named Pacik, the head of a party, and told him\r\nthat I was certainly lost. Pacik assured him that he had just heard\r\nfrom me. The man, still alarmed for my safety, went to another officer\r\nand told him the same story. This person was not in the secret;\r\nterrified at learning that an officer had dismissed the man without\r\narresting him, he went to the major; the latter had Pacik arrested, and\r\nsent, during the night, a report of the arrest to Oranienbaum. Instantly\r\nthe whole regiment was in commotion, and our conspirators in alarm. It\r\nwas resolved, in the first instance, to send to me the second brother\r\nOrloff, to bring me into the city, while the other two brothers went\r\nabout everywhere reporting that I had arrived there. The Hetman,\r\nVolkonsky, and Panin, were in the secret.\r\n\r\nI was almost alone, at Peterhoff, amongst my women, seemingly forgotten\r\nby every one. My days, however, were much disturbed, for I was regularly\r\ninformed of all that was plotting both for and against me. At six\r\no'clock on the morning of the 28th, Alexis Orloff entered my room, awoke\r\nme, and said very quietly, \"It is time to get up; everything is prepared\r\nfor proclaiming you.\" I asked for details. He replied, \"_Pacik has been\r\narrested_.\" I no longer hesitated, but dressed hastily, without waiting\r\nto make any toilet, and entered the carriage which he had brought with\r\nhim. Another officer, disguised as a valet, was at the carriage-door; a\r\nthird met us at the distance of some verstes from Peterhoff. At five\r\nverstes from the city, I met the elder Orloff with the younger Prince\r\nBaratinsky. The latter gave me up his seat in his carriage, my horses\r\nbeing tired out, and we drove to the barracks of the Ismaïlofsky\r\nregiment. We found there only twelve men and a drummer, who instantly\r\nbeat the alarm. The soldiers came running in, embraced me, kissed my\r\nfeet, my hands, my dress, calling me their saviour. Two of them brought\r\nin a priest between them, with the cross, and the oath was at once\r\nadministered. This done, I was requested to enter a carriage. The priest\r\nwalked in front, bearing the cross, and we proceeded to the regiment of\r\nSimeonofsky, which advanced to meet us with shouts of _Vivat!_ We next\r\nwent to the church of Kasan, where I alighted. The regiment of\r\nPreobrajensky came up with like shouts of _Vivat!_ at the same time\r\nsaying to me, \"Pardon us for having come last, our officers detained us,\r\nbut here are four of them whom we have brought to you under arrest, to\r\nshow you our zeal, for we are of the same mind as our brethren.\" Then\r\ncame the horse-guards in a perfect delirium of delight. I have never\r\nseen anything like it. They shouted, they wept for very joy at the\r\ndeliverance of their country. This scene took place between the garden\r\nof the Hetman and the Kasanski. The horse-guards were in a body, with\r\ntheir officers at their head. As I knew that my uncle Prince George, to\r\nwhom Peter III had given this regiment, was thoroughly hated by it, I\r\nsent some footguards to him, begging him to remain at home for fear of\r\naccident. But the guards had anticipated me, and had sent a detachment\r\nto arrest him. His house was pillaged, and he himself ill-treated. I\r\nwent to the new Winter Palace, where the synod and senate had assembled.\r\nThe manifesto and oath were drawn up in haste. Thence I descended, and\r\nmade, on foot, the inspection of the troops; there were more than\r\nfourteen thousand men, guards and country regiments. The instant I\r\nappeared the air was rent with shouts of joy, which were caught up and\r\nrepeated by an innumerable multitude. I then proceeded to the old Winter\r\nPalace, to take the necessary measures for completing our work. There a\r\ncouncil was held, and it was determined that I should go at the head of\r\nthe troops to Peterhoff, where Peter III was to dine. Posts were\r\nstationed on all the roads, and we received information from moment to\r\nmoment. I sent Admiral Taliezsin to Cronstadt. Then came the Chancellor\r\nVoronzoff to reprove me for having left Peterhoff. He was led to the\r\nchurch to swear fealty to me; that was my answer. Next came Prince\r\nTroubetzkoy and Count Alexander Schouvaloff, also from Peterhoff: they\r\ncame to assure themselves of the fidelity of the regiments, and put me\r\nto death. They also were quietly led away to take the oath.\r\n\r\nHaving despatched all our couriers, and taken all our precautions, I\r\ndressed, about ten o'clock at night, in the uniform of the guards, and\r\nhad myself proclaimed Colonel amid acclamations of inexpressible\r\nenthusiasm. I mounted on horseback, and we left behind us only a small\r\ndetachment from every regiment for the protection of my son, who\r\nremained in the city.\r\n\r\nThus I set out at the head of the troops, and we marched all night\r\ntowards Peterhoff. Having reached the little monastery, the\r\nVice-Chancellor Galitsin brought me a very flattering letter from Peter\r\nIII. I forgot to say that, on leaving the city, three soldiers, sent\r\nfrom Peterhoff to distribute a manifesto among the people, brought it to\r\nme, saying, \"Here, this is what Peter III has charged us with; we give\r\nit to you, and we are very glad to have this opportunity of joining our\r\nbrethren.\" After this first letter from Peter III, another was brought\r\nto me by General Michael Ismaïloff, who, throwing himself at my feet,\r\nsaid, \"Do you take me for an honest man?\" I replied, \"Yes.\" \"Well,\r\nthen,\" he said, \"it is pleasant to have to deal with sensible people.\r\nThe Emperor offers to resign. I will bring him to you after his\r\nresignation, which is entirely voluntary, and I shall save my country\r\nfrom a civil war.\" I willingly charged him with this commission, and he\r\ndeparted to fulfil it.\r\n\r\nPeter III renounced the empire at Oranienbaum, in full liberty,\r\nsurrounded by fifteen hundred Holstein troops, and came to Peterhoff,\r\naccompanied by Elizabeth Voronzoff, Godowitz, and Michael Ismaïloff.\r\nThere, as a guard, I assigned him five officers and some soldiers. This\r\nwas on the 29th of June, the Feast of St. Peter, at noon. While dinner\r\nwas being prepared for every one, the soldiers got it into their heads\r\nthat Peter III had been brought by the Field-Marshal Prince Troubetzkoy,\r\nand that the latter was endeavouring to make peace between us. Instantly\r\nthey charged all the passers-by, among others the Hetman, the Orloffs,\r\nand many others, saying that they had not seen me for three hours, and\r\nthat they were dying with fear lest that old rogue, Troubetzkoy, should\r\ndeceive me \"by making,\" they said, \"a pretended peace between your\r\nhusband and you, and thus ruining you and us also, but we will cut them\r\nin pieces.\" These were their expressions. I went and spoke to\r\nTroubetzkoy, and said to him, \"Pray get into your carriage, while I\r\nmake, on foot, the tour of these troops.\" I related what had occurred;\r\nhe was much frightened, and instantly set off for the city, while I was\r\nreceived by the soldiers with unbounded joy. After this, I placed the\r\ndeposed Emperor under the command of Alexis Orloff, with four chosen\r\nofficers, and a detachment of quiet and sober men, and sent him to a\r\ndistance of twenty-seven verstes from St. Petersburg, to a place called\r\nRapscha, very retired, but very pleasant, where he was to remain, while\r\ndecent and comfortable apartments were prepared for him at\r\nSchlusselburg, and relays of horses placed on the road. But it pleased\r\nGod to dispose otherwise. Terror had brought on a dysentery, which\r\ncontinued for three days, and stopped on the fourth. He drank to excess\r\non that day, for he had everything he wanted except his liberty. He\r\nhad, however, asked me for nothing but his mistress, big dog, his negro,\r\nand his violin; but, for fear of scandal, and not wishing to increase\r\nthe general excitement, I sent him only the three last named. The\r\nhemorrhoidal cholic again came on, accompanied by delirium; he was two\r\ndays in this condition, which was followed by excessive weakness, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts of the physicians, he at last sunk,\r\ndemanding a Lutheran clergyman. I was afraid the officers might have\r\npoisoned him, so much was he hated. I had him opened, but not a trace of\r\npoison could be discovered. The stomach was very healthy, but the bowels\r\nwere inflamed, and he had been carried off by a stroke of apoplexy. His\r\nheart was excessively small, and also dried up.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure from Peterhoff, I was advised to go straight to the\r\ncity. I foresaw that the troops would be alarmed, and I therefore had\r\nthe report spread, under the pretext of ascertaining at what hour they\r\nwould be in a condition to march. After three days of such excessive\r\nfatigue, they fixed the time for ten o'clock that night, \"provided,\"\r\nthey added, \"that she comes with us.\" I departed, therefore, with them,\r\nand midway stopped to rest at the country residence of Kourakin, where I\r\nflung myself on a bed, dressed as I was. An officer took off my boots. I\r\nslept two hours and a half, and then we resumed our march by the\r\nCatherinoff road. I was on horseback; a regiment of hussars marched in\r\nfront; then my escort, which was the horse-guards; then immediately\r\nafter me came my court; behind which marched the regiments of the\r\nguards, according to seniority, and three country regiments. I entered\r\nthe city amid loud acclamations, and proceeded thus to the Summer\r\nPalace, where the court, the synod, my son, and all privileged to\r\napproach me, were awaiting me. I went to mass; then the _Te Deum_ was\r\nsung; then I had to receive felicitations--I who had scarcely eaten, or\r\ndrank, or slept since six o'clock on Friday morning. I was very glad to\r\nbe able to retire to rest on Sunday night.\r\n\r\nScarcely was I asleep, when, at midnight, Captain Pacik entered my room\r\nand awoke me, saying, \"Our people are horribly drunk: a hussar, in the\r\nsame condition, has gone among them crying, 'To arms! three thousand\r\nPrussians are coming; they want to carry off our mother!' Upon this they\r\nhave seized their arms, and have come to inquire how you are, saying\r\nthat it is three hours since they have seen you, and that they will go\r\nquietly home, provided they find that you are well. They will not listen\r\nto their chiefs, nor even to the Orloffs.\" So I had to get up again;\r\nand, not to alarm the guard of the court, which consisted of a\r\nbattalion, I first went to them, and explained the reason of my going\r\nout at such an hour. I then entered my carriage with two officers, and\r\nproceeded to the troops. I told them I was quite well, that they must go\r\nhome to bed, and allow me also to have some rest, as I had only just\r\nlaid down, having had no sleep for three nights, and that I trusted they\r\nwould in future listen to their officers. They replied that they had\r\nbeen frightened with those cursed Prussians, and that they were ready to\r\ndie for me. \"Very well, then,\" I said, \"I am very much obliged to you,\r\nbut go to bed.\" Upon this they wished me good night and good health, and\r\nwent off like lambs, every now and then turning back to look at my\r\ncarriage as they went. The next day they sent me their apologies and\r\nregrets for having broken my rest.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume to describe the conduct of each of the chiefs.\r\nThe Orloffs have shone by their skill in guiding others, their prudent\r\ndaring, their great presence of mind, and the authority which this\r\nconduct gave them. They have a great deal of good sense, a generous\r\ncourage, an enthusiastic patriotism, and an honourable mind. They are\r\npassionately devoted to me, and united amongst each other to a degree\r\nthat I have never before seen in brothers. There are five of them, but\r\nonly three were here. Captain Pacik has greatly distinguished himself by\r\nremaining for twelve hours under arrest, although the soldiers opened\r\ndoors and windows for him; and this he did in order not to alarm his\r\nregiment before my arrival, although he expected every moment to be led\r\nto Oranienbaum, and put to the question. Fortunately this order from\r\nPeter III did not arrive until I had entered St. Petersburg. The\r\nPrincess Dashkoff, the youngest sister of Elizabeth Voronzoff, although\r\nshe wishes to arrogate to herself all the honour of this revolution, was\r\nin very bad odour on account of her connections, while her age, which is\r\nonly nineteen, was not calculated to inspire confidence. She pretends\r\nthat everything passed through her to reach me, yet I was in\r\ncommunication with all the chiefs for six months before she even knew\r\none of their names. It is quite true that she has great talent, but it\r\nis spoilt by her excessive ostentation and her naturally quarrelsome\r\ndisposition. She is hated by the chiefs, and liked by the giddy and\r\nrash, who communicated to her all they knew, which was only the minor\r\ndetails. Ivan Schouvaloff, the basest and most cowardly of men, has\r\nwritten, I am told, to Voltaire, that a woman of nineteen had overturned\r\nthe government of this empire. Pray undeceive this distinguished writer.\r\nIt was necessary to conceal from the Princess Dashkoff the channels\r\nthrough which others reached me, five months before she knew anything;\r\nand, during the last four weeks, no more was told her than was\r\nabsolutely unavoidable. The strength of mind of Prince Baratinsky, who\r\nconcealed this secret from a beloved brother, adjutant to the late\r\nEmperor, simply because a disclosure would have been in this case\r\nuseless, also deserves great commendation. In the horse-guards an\r\nofficer named Chitron(?), only twenty-two years old, and an inferior\r\nofficer of seventeen, named Potemkin, directed everything with great\r\ncourage and activity.\r\n\r\nSuch, pretty nearly, is our history. The whole was managed, I confess,\r\nunder my immediate direction, and towards the end I had to check its\r\nprogress, as our departure for the country prevented the execution;\r\neverything, in fact, was more than ripe a fortnight beforehand. The late\r\nEmperor, when he heard of the tumult in the city, was hindered by the\r\nwomen about him from following the counsel of old Field-Marshal Munich,\r\nwho advised him to throw himself into Cronstadt, or proceed with a small\r\nretinue to the army; and when, finally, he went in a galley to\r\nCronstadt, the place was in our hands by the good management of Admiral\r\nTalieszin, who disarmed General Lievers, previously sent there on the\r\npart of the Emperor. After the arrival of Talieszin, an officer of the\r\nport, on his own responsibility, threatened to open fire on the galley\r\nof the unfortunate Prince if he attempted a landing. In a word, God has\r\nbrought everything about in his own good pleasure, and the whole is more\r\nof a miracle than a merely human contrivance, for assuredly nothing but\r\nthe Divine will could have produced so many felicitous combinations.\r\n\r\n_We will close this letter of Catherine II. by a short extract from a\r\ndispatch of M.

It is in the form of a\r\n letter, written or dictated by the Empress herself, and appears to\r\n have been addressed to Poniatowsky. Although already printed, it is\r\n but little known, and the reader, we doubt not, will be glad to have\r\n it in this place. We take it from a most interesting work, published\r\n at Berlin in 1843, by Schneider, _La Cour de la Russie, il y cent ans_\r\n (The Court of Russia, a hundred years ago).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTypographical errors corrected by the etext transcriber:\r\n\r\nI told hiin=> I told him {pg 31}\r\n\r\nI bey your pardon=> I beg your pardon {pg 64}\r\n\r\nplaced with me bebause=> placed with me because {pg 66}\r\n\r\nPepnine=> Repnine {pg 75}\r\n\r\nthe Prineess Repnine=> the Princess Repnine {pg 75}\r\n\r\nYevrienoff entreated me=> Yevreinoff entreated me {pg 79}\r\n\r\nseven vertses=> seven verstes {pg 110}\r\n\r\nThe fits thing=> The first thing {pg 243}",
