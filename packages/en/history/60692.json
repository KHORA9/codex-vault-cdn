D. ROCKEFELLER, JR., IN AN ADDRESS ON TRUSTS,\r\n                              TO THE STUDENTS OF BROWN UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is the outgrowth of an effort on the part of the editors of\r\nMcClure’s Magazine to deal concretely in their pages with the trust\r\nquestion. In order that their readers might have a clear and succinct\r\nnotion of the processes by which a particular industry passes from the\r\ncontrol of the many to that of the few, they decided a few years ago to\r\npublish a detailed narrative of the history of the growth of a\r\nparticular trust. The Standard Oil Trust was chosen for obvious reasons.\r\nIt was the first in the field, and it has furnished the methods, the\r\ncharter, and the traditions for its followers. It is the most perfectly\r\ndeveloped trust in existence; that is, it satisfies most nearly the\r\ntrust ideal of entire control of the commodity in which it deals. Its\r\nvast profits have led its officers into various allied interests, such\r\nas railroads, shipping, gas, copper, iron, steel, as well as into banks\r\nand trust companies, and to the acquiring and solidifying of these\r\ninterests it has applied the methods used in building up the Oil Trust.\r\nIt has led in the struggle against legislation directed against\r\ncombinations. Its power in state and Federal government, in the press,\r\nin the college, in the pulpit, is generally recognised. The perfection\r\nof the organisation of the Standard, the ability and daring with which\r\nit has carried out its projects, make it the pre-eminent trust of the\r\nworld—the one whose story is best fitted to illuminate the subject of\r\ncombinations of capital.\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration with the editors in deciding that the\r\nStandard Oil Trust was the best adapted to illustrate their meaning, was\r\nthe fact that it is one of the very few business organisations of the\r\ncountry whose growth could be traced in trustworthy documents. There is\r\nin existence just such documentary material for a history of the\r\nStandard Oil Company as there is for a history of the Civil War or the\r\nFrench Revolution, or any other national episode which has divided men’s\r\nminds. This has come about largely from the fact that almost constantly\r\nsince its organisation in 1870 the Standard Oil Company has been under\r\ninvestigation by the Congress of the United States and by the\r\nLegislatures of various states in which it has operated, on the\r\nsuspicion that it was receiving rebates from the railroads and was\r\npractising methods in restraint of free trade. In 1872 and again in 1876\r\nit was before Congressional committees, in 1879 it was before examiners\r\nof the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and before committees appointed by\r\nthe Legislatures of New York and of Ohio for investigating railroads.\r\nIts operations figured constantly in the debate which led up to the\r\ncreation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, and again and\r\nagain since that time the Commission has been called upon to examine\r\ndirectly or indirectly into its relation with the railroads.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, in the Investigation of Trusts conducted by Congress and by the\r\nstate of New York, the Standard Oil Company was the chief subject for\r\nexamination. In the state of Ohio, between 1882 and 1892, a constant\r\nwarfare was waged against the Standard in the courts and Legislature,\r\nresulting in several volumes of testimony. The Legislatures of many\r\nother states concerned themselves with it. This hostile legislation\r\ncompelled the trust to separate into its component parts in 1892, but\r\ninvestigation did not cease; indeed, in the last great industrial\r\ninquiry, conducted by the Commission appointed by President McKinley,\r\nthe Standard Oil Company was constantly under discussion, and hundreds\r\nof pages of testimony on it appear in the nineteen volumes of reports\r\nwhich the Commission has submitted.\r\n\r\nThis mass of testimony, all of it submitted under oath it should be\r\nremembered, contains the different charters and agreements under which\r\nthe Standard Oil Trust has operated, many contracts and agreements with\r\nrailroads, with refineries, with pipe-lines, and it contains the\r\nexperiences in business from 1872 up to 1900 of multitudes of\r\nindividuals. These experiences have exactly the quality of the personal\r\nreminiscences of actors in great events, with the additional value that\r\nthey were given on the witness stand, and it is fair, therefore, to\r\nsuppose that they are more cautious and exact in statements than many\r\nwriters of memoirs are. These investigations, covering as they do all of\r\nthe important steps in the development of the trust, include full\r\naccounts of the point of view of its officers in regard to that\r\ndevelopment, as well as their explanations of many of the operations\r\nover which controversy has arisen. Hundreds of pages of sworn testimony\r\nare found in these volumes from John D. Rockefeller, William\r\nRockefeller, Henry M. Flagler, H. H. Rogers, John D. Archbold, Daniel\r\nO’Day and other members of the concern.\r\n\r\nAside from the great mass of sworn testimony accessible to the student\r\nthere is a large pamphlet literature dealing with different phases of\r\nthe subject, and there are files of the numerous daily newspapers and\r\nmonthly reviews, supported by the Oil Regions, in the columns of which\r\nare to be found not only statistics but full reports of all\r\ncontroversies between oil men. No complete collection of this voluminous\r\nprinted material has ever been made, but several small collections\r\nexist, and in one or another of these I have been able to find\r\npractically all of the important documents relating to the subject. Mrs.\r\nRoger Sherman of Titusville, Pennsylvania, owns the largest of these\r\ncollections, and in it are to be found copies of the rarest pamphlets.\r\nLewis Emery, Jr., of Bradford, the late E. G. Patterson of Titusville,\r\nthe late Henry D. Lloyd, author of “Wealth _vs._ Commonwealth,” William\r\nHasson of Oil City, and P. C. Boyle, the editor of the Oil City Derrick,\r\nhave collections of value, and they have all been most generous in\r\ngiving me access to their books.\r\n\r\nBut the documentary sources of this work are by no means all printed.\r\nThe Standard Oil Trust and its constituent companies have figured in\r\nmany civil suits, the testimony of which is still in manuscript in the\r\nfiles of the courts where the suits were tried. These manuscripts have\r\nbeen examined on the ground, and in numerous instances full copies of\r\naffidavits and of important testimony have been made for permanent\r\nreference and study. I have also had access to many files of private\r\ncorrespondence and papers, the most important being that of the officers\r\nand counsel of the Petroleum Producers’ Union from 1878 to 1880, that\r\ncovering the organisation from 1887 to 1895 of the various independent\r\ncompanies which resulted in the Pure Oil Company, and that containing\r\nthe material prepared by Roger Sherman for the suit brought in 1897 by\r\nthe United States Pipe Line against certain of the Standard companies\r\nunder the Sherman anti-trust law.\r\n\r\nAs many of the persons who have been active in the development of the\r\noil industry are still living, their help has been freely sought. Scores\r\nof persons in each of the great oil centres have been interviewed, and\r\nthe comprehension and interpretation of the documents on which the work\r\nis based have been materially aided by the explanations which the actors\r\nin the events under consideration were able to give.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was first announced in the fall of 1901, the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, or perhaps I should say officers of the company, courteously\r\noffered to give me all the assistance in their power, an offer of which\r\nI have freely taken advantage. In accepting assistance from Standard men\r\nas from independents I distinctly stated that I wanted facts, and that I\r\nreserved the right to use them according to my own judgment of their\r\nmeaning, that my object was to learn more perfectly what was actually\r\ndone—not to learn what my informants thought of what had been done. It\r\nis perhaps not too much to say that there is not a single important\r\nepisode in the history of the Standard Oil Company, so far as I know it,\r\nor a notable step in its growth, which I have not discussed more or less\r\nfully with officers of the company.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to add that the conclusions expressed in this work are my\r\nown.\r\n\r\n                                                                I.

Twelve years before this strip\r\nof land had been but little better than a wilderness; its chief\r\ninhabitants the lumbermen, who every season cut great swaths of primeval\r\npine and hemlock from its hills, and in the spring floated them down the\r\nAllegheny River to Pittsburg. The great tides of Western emigration had\r\nshunned the spot for years as too rugged and unfriendly for settlement,\r\nand yet in twelve years this region avoided by men had been transformed\r\ninto a bustling trade centre, where towns elbowed each other for place,\r\ninto which three great trunk railroads had built branches, and every\r\nfoot of whose soil was fought for by capitalists. It was the discovery\r\nand development of a new raw product, petroleum, which had made this\r\nchange from wilderness to market-place. This product in twelve years had\r\nnot only peopled a waste place of the earth, it had revolutionised the\r\nworld’s methods of illumination and added millions upon millions of\r\ndollars to the wealth of the United States.\r\n\r\nPetroleum as a curiosity, and indeed in a small way as an article of\r\ncommerce, was no new thing when its discovery in quantities called the\r\nattention of the world to this corner of Northwestern Pennsylvania. The\r\njournals of many an early explorer of the valleys of the Allegheny and\r\nits tributaries tell of springs and streams the surfaces of which were\r\nfound covered with a thick oily substance which burned fiercely when\r\nignited and which the Indians believed to have curative properties. As\r\nthe country was opened, more and more was heard of these oil springs.\r\nCertain streams came to be named from the quantities of the substance\r\nfound on the surface of the water, as “Oil Creek” in Northwestern\r\nPennsylvania, “Old Greasy” or Kanawha in West Virginia. The belief in\r\nthe substance as a cure-all increased as time went on and in various\r\nparts of the country it was regularly skimmed from the surface of the\r\nwater as cream from a pan, or soaked up by woollen blankets, bottled,\r\nand peddled as a medicine for man and beast.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of the 19th century no oil seems to have been\r\nobtained except from the surfaces of springs and streams. That it was to\r\nbe found far below the surface of the earth was discovered independently\r\nat various points in Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania by\r\npersons drilling for salt-water to be used in manufacturing salt. Not\r\ninfrequently the water they found was mixed with a dark-green,\r\nevil-smelling substance which was recognised as identical with the\r\nwell-known “rock-oil.” It was necessary to rid the water of this before\r\nit could be used for salt, and in many places cisterns were devised in\r\nwhich the brine was allowed to stand until the oil had risen to the\r\nsurface. It was then run into the streams or on the ground. This\r\npractice was soon discovered to be dangerous, so easily did the oil\r\nignite. In several places, particularly in Kentucky, so much oil was\r\nobtained with the salt-water that the wells had to be abandoned. Certain\r\nof these deserted salt wells were opened years after, when it was found\r\nthat the troublesome substance which had made them useless was far more\r\nvaluable than the brine the original drillers sought.\r\n\r\nNaturally the first use made of the oil obtained in quantities from the\r\nsalt wells was medicinal. By the middle of the century it was without\r\ndoubt the great American medicine. “Seneca Oil” seems to have been the\r\nearliest name under which petroleum appeared in the East. It was\r\nfollowed by a large output of Kentucky petroleum sold under the name\r\n“American Medicinal Oil.” Several hundred thousand bottles of this oil\r\nare said to have been put up in Burkesville, Kentucky, and to have been\r\nshipped to the East and to Europe. The point at which the business of\r\nbottling petroleum for medicine was carried on most systematically and\r\nextensively was Pittsburg. Near that town, at Tarentum in Alleghany\r\nCounty, were located salt wells owned and operated in the forties by\r\nSamuel M. Kier. The oil which came up with the salt-water was sufficient\r\nto be a nuisance, and Mr. Kier sought a way to use it. Believing it had\r\ncurative qualities he began to bottle it. By 1850 he had worked up this\r\nbusiness until “Kier’s Petroleum, or Rock-Oil” was sold all over the\r\nUnited States. The crude petroleum was put up in eight-ounce bottles\r\nwrapped in a circular setting forth in good patent-medicine style its\r\nvirtues as a cure-all, and giving directions about its use. While it was\r\nadmitted to be chiefly a liniment it was recommended for cholera morbus,\r\nliver complaint, bronchitis and consumption, and the dose prescribed was\r\nthree teaspoonfuls three times a day! Mr. Kier’s circulars are crowded\r\nwith testimonials of the efficacy of rock-oil, dated anywhere between\r\n1848 and 1853. Although his trade in this oil was so extensive he was\r\nnot satisfied that petroleum was useful only as a medicine. He was\r\ninterested in it as a lubricator and a luminant. That petroleum had the\r\nqualities of both had been discovered at more than one point before\r\n1850. More than one mill-owner in the districts where petroleum had been\r\nfound was using it in a crude way for oiling his machines or lighting\r\nhis works, but though the qualities of both lubricator and luminant were\r\npresent, the impurities of the natural oil were too great to make its\r\nuse general. Mr. Kier seems to have been the first man to have attempted\r\nto secure an expert opinion as to the possibility of refining it. In\r\n1849 he sent a bottle of oil to a chemist in Philadelphia, who advised\r\nhim to try distilling it and burning it in a lamp. Mr. Kier followed the\r\nadvice, and a five-barrel still which he used in the fifties for\r\nrefining petroleum is still to be seen in Pittsburg. His trade in the\r\noil he produced at his little refinery was not entirely local, for in\r\n1858 we find him agreeing to sell to Joseph Coffin of New York at 62½\r\ncents a gallon 100 barrels of “carbon oil that will burn in the ordinary\r\ncoal-oil lamp.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Kier seems to have done a good business in rock-oil,\r\nneither he nor any one else up to this point had thought it worth while\r\nto seek petroleum for its own sake. They had all simply sought to\r\nutilise what rose before their eyes on springs and streams or came to\r\nthem mixed with the salt-water for which they drilled. In 1854, however,\r\na man was found who took rock-oil more seriously. This man was George H.\r\nBissell, a graduate of Dartmouth College, who, worn out by an experience\r\nof ten years in the South as a journalist and teacher, had come North\r\nfor a change. At his old college the latest curiosity of the laboratory\r\nwas shown him—the bottle of rock-oil—and the professor contended that it\r\nwas as good, or better, than coal for making illuminating oil. Bissell\r\ninquired into its origin, and was told that it came from oil springs\r\nlocated in Northwestern Pennsylvania on the farm of a lumber firm,\r\nBrewer, Watson and Company. These springs had long yielded a supply of\r\noil which was regularly collected and sold for medicine, and was used\r\nlocally by mill-owners for lighting and lubricating purposes.\r\n\r\nBissell seems to have been impressed with the commercial possibilities\r\nof the oil, for he at once organised a company, the Pennsylvania\r\nRock-Oil Company, the first in the United States, and leased the lands\r\non which these oil springs were located. He then sent a quantity of the\r\noil to Professor Silliman of Yale College, and paid him for analysing\r\nit. The professor’s report was published and received general attention.\r\nFrom the rock-oil might be made as good an illuminant as any the world\r\nknew. It also yielded gas, paraffine, lubricating oil. “In short,”\r\ndeclared Professor Silliman, “your company have in their possession a\r\nraw material from which, by simple and not expensive process, they may\r\nmanufacture very valuable products. It is worthy of note that my\r\nexperiments prove that nearly the whole of the raw product may be\r\nmanufactured without waste, and this solely by a well-directed process\r\nwhich is in practice in one of the most simple of all chemical\r\nprocesses.”[1]\r\n\r\nThe oil was valuable, but could it be obtained in quantities great\r\nenough to make the development of so remote a locality worth while? The\r\nonly method of obtaining it known to Mr. Bissell and his associates in\r\nthe new company was from the surface of oil springs. Could it be\r\nobtained in any other way? There has long been a story current in the\r\nOil Regions that the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil Company received its first\r\nnotion of drilling for oil from one of those trivial incidents which so\r\noften turn the course of human affairs. As the story goes, Mr. Bissell\r\nwas one day walking down Broadway when he halted to rest in the shade of\r\nan awning before a drug store. In the window he saw on a bottle a\r\ncurious label, “Kier’s Petroleum, or Rock-Oil,” it read, “Celebrated for\r\nits wonderful curative powers. A natural Remedy; Produced from a well in\r\nAllegheny Co., Pa., four hundred feet below the earth’s surface,” etc.\r\nOn the label was the picture of an artesian well. It was from this well\r\nthat Mr. Kier got his “Natural Remedy.” Hundreds of men had seen the\r\nlabel before, for it went out on every one of Mr. Kier’s circulars, but\r\nthis was the first to look at it with a “seeing eye.” As quickly as the\r\nbottle of rock-oil in the Dartmouth laboratory had awakened in Mr.\r\nBissell’s mind the determination to find out the real value of the\r\nstrange substance, the label gave him the solution of the problem of\r\ngetting oil in quantities—it was to bore down into the earth where it\r\nwas stored, and pump it up.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman made his report to the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil Company\r\nin 1855, but it was not until the spring of 1858 that a representative\r\nof the organisation, which by this time had changed hands and was known\r\nas the Seneca Oil Company, was on the ground with orders to find oil.\r\nThe man sent out was a small stockholder in the company, Edwin L. Drake,\r\n“Colonel” Drake as he was called. Drake had had no experience to fit him\r\nfor his task. A man forty years of age, he had spent his life as a\r\nclerk, an express agent, and a railway conductor. His only\r\nqualifications were a dash of pioneer blood and a great persistency in\r\nundertakings which interested him. Whether Drake came to Titusville\r\nordered to put down an artesian well or not is a mooted point. His\r\nlatter-day admirers claim that the idea was entirely his own. It seems\r\nhardly credible that men as intelligent as Professor Silliman, Mr.\r\nBissell, and others interested in the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil Company,\r\nshould not have taken means of finding out how the familiar “Kier’s\r\nRock-Oil” was obtained. Professor Silliman at least must have known of\r\nthe quantities of oil which had been obtained in different states in\r\ndrilling salt wells; indeed, in his report (see Appendix, Number 1) he\r\nspeaks of “wells sunk for the purpose of accumulating the product.” In\r\nthe “American Journal of Science” for 1840—of which he was one of the\r\neditors—is an account of a famous oil well struck near Burkesville,\r\nKentucky, about 1830, when drilling for salt. It seems probable that the\r\nidea of seeking oil on the lands leased by the Petroleum Rock-Oil\r\nCompany by drilling artesian wells had been long discussed by the\r\ngentlemen interested in the venture, and that Drake came to Titusville\r\nwith instructions to put down a well. It is certain, at all events, that\r\nhe was soon explaining to his superiors at home the difficulty of\r\ngetting a driller, an engine-house and tools, and that he was employing\r\nthe interval in trying to open new oil springs and make the old ones\r\nmore profitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  E. L. DRAKE\r\n\r\n  In 1859 Drake drilled near Titusville, Pennsylvania, the first\r\n    artesian well put down for petroleum. He is popularly said to have\r\n    “discovered oil.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe task before Drake was no light one. The spot to which he had been\r\nsent was Titusville, a lumberman’s hamlet on Oil Creek, fourteen miles\r\nfrom where that stream joins the Allegheny River. Its chief connection\r\nwith the outside world was by a stage to Erie, forty miles away. This\r\nremoteness from civilisation and Drake’s own ignorance of artesian\r\nwells, added to the general scepticism of the community concerning the\r\nenterprise, caused great difficulty and long delays. It was months\r\nbefore Drake succeeded in getting together the tools, engine and rigging\r\nnecessary to bore his well, and before he could get a driller who knew\r\nhow to manipulate them, winter had come, and he had to suspend\r\noperations. People called him crazy for sticking to the enterprise, but\r\nthat had no effect on him. As soon as spring opened he borrowed a horse\r\nand wagon and drove over a hundred miles to Tarentum, where Mr. Kier was\r\nstill pumping his salt wells, and was either bottling or refining the\r\noil which came up with the brine. Here Drake hoped to find a driller. He\r\nbrought back a man, and after a few months more of experiments and\r\naccidents the drill was started. One day late in August, 1859,\r\nTitusville was electrified by the news that Drake’s Folly, as many of\r\nthe onlookers had come to consider it, had justified itself. The well\r\nwas full of oil. The next day a pump was started, and twenty-five\r\nbarrels of oil were gathered.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt of the meaning of the Drake well in the minds of the\r\npeople of the vicinity. They had long ago accepted all Professor\r\nSilliman had said of the possibilities of petroleum, and now that they\r\nknew how it could be obtained in quantity, the whole countryside rushed\r\nout to obtain leases. The second well in the immediate region was\r\ndrilled by a Titusville tanner, William Barnsdall—an Englishman who at\r\nhis majority had come to America to make his fortune. He had fought his\r\nway westward, watching always for his chance. The day the Drake well was\r\nstruck he knew it had come. Quickly forming a company he began to drill\r\na well. He did not wait for an engine, but worked his drill through the\r\nrock by a spring pole.[2] It took three months, and cost $3,000 to do\r\nit, but he had his reward. On February 1, 1860, he struck\r\noil—twenty-five barrels a day—and oil was selling at eighteen dollars a\r\nbarrel. In five months the English tanner had sold over $16,000 worth of\r\noil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE DRAKE WELL IN 1859. THE FIRST OIL WELL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA lumberman and merchant of the village, who long had had faith in\r\npetroleum if it could be had in quantity, Jonathan Watson, one of the\r\nfirm of Brewer, Watson and Company, whose land the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil\r\nCompany had leased, mounted his horse as soon as he heard of the Drake\r\nwell, and, riding down the valley of Oil Creek, spent the day in leasing\r\nfarms. He soon had the third well of the region going down, this too by\r\na spring pole. This well started off in March at sixty gallons a minute,\r\nand oil was selling at sixty cents a gallon. In two years the farm where\r\nthis third well was struck had produced 165,000 barrels of oil.\r\n\r\nWorking an unfriendly piece of land a few miles below the Drake well\r\nlived a man of thirty-five. Setting out for himself at twenty-two, he\r\nhad won his farm by the most dogged efforts, working in sawmills, saving\r\nhis earnings, buying a team, working it for others until he could take\r\nup a piece of land, hoarding his savings here. For what? How could he\r\nknow? He knew well enough when Drake struck oil, and hastened out to buy\r\na share in a two-acre farm. He sold it at a profit, and with the money\r\nput down a well, from which he realised $70,000. A few years later the\r\nfarm he had slaved to win came into the field. In 1871 he refused a\r\nmillion dollars for it, and at one time he had stored there 200,000\r\nbarrels of oil.\r\n\r\nA young doctor who had buried himself in the wilderness saw his chance.\r\nFor a song he bought thirty-eight acres on the creek, six miles below\r\nthe Drake well, and sold half of it for the price he had paid to a\r\ncountry storekeeper and lumberman of the vicinity, one Charles Hyde. Out\r\nof this thirty-eight acres millions of dollars came; one well alone—the\r\nMapleshade—cleared one and one-half millions.\r\n\r\nOn every rocky farm, in every poor settlement of the region, was some\r\nman whose ear was attuned to Fortune’s call, and who had the daring and\r\nthe energy to risk everything he possessed in an oil lease. It was well\r\nthat he acted at once; for, as the news of the discovery of oil reached\r\nthe open, the farms and towns of Ohio, New York, and Pennsylvania poured\r\nout a stream of ambitious and vigorous youths, eager to seize what might\r\nbe there for them, while from the East came men with money and business\r\nexperience, who formed great stock companies, took up lands in parcels\r\nof thousands of acres, and put down wells along every rocky run and\r\ncreek, as well as over the steep hills. In answer to their drill, oil\r\npoured forth in floods. In many places pumping was out of the question;\r\nthe wells flowed 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 barrels a day—such quantities of it\r\nthat at the close of 1861 oil which in January of 1860 was twenty\r\ndollars a barrel had fallen to ten cents.\r\n\r\nHere was the oil, and in unheard-of quantities, and with it came all the\r\nswarm of problems which a discovery brings. The methods Drake had used\r\nwere crude and must be improved. The processes of refining were those of\r\nthe laboratory and must be developed. Communication with the outside\r\nworld must be secured. Markets must be built up. Indeed, a whole new\r\ncommercial machine had to be created to meet the discovery. These\r\nproblems were not realised before the region teemed with men to wrestle\r\nwith them—men “alive to the instant need of things.” They had to begin\r\nwith so simple and elementary a matter as devising something to hold the\r\noil. There were not barrels enough to be bought in America, although\r\nturpentine barrels, molasses barrels, whiskey barrels—every sort of\r\nbarrel and cask—were added to new ones made especially for oil.\r\nReservoirs excavated in the earth and faced with logs and cement, and\r\nbox-like structures of planks or logs were tried at first but were not\r\nsatisfactory. A young Iowa school teacher and farmer, visiting at his\r\nhome in Erie County, went to the region. Immediately he saw his chance.\r\nIt was to invent a receptacle which would hold oil in quantities.\r\nCertain large producers listened to his scheme and furnished money to\r\nmake a trial tank. It was a success, and before many months the school\r\nteacher was buying thousands of feet of lumber, employing scores of men,\r\nand working them and himself—day and night. For nearly ten years he\r\nbuilt these wooden tanks. Then seeing that iron tanks—huge receptacles\r\nholding thousands of barrels where his held hundreds—were bound to\r\nsupersede him, he turned, with the ready adaptability which\r\ncharacterised the men of the region, to producing oil for others to\r\ntank.\r\n\r\nAfter the storing problem came that of transportation. There was one\r\nwaterway leading out—Oil Creek, as it had been called for more than a\r\nhundred years,—an uncertain stream running the length of the narrow\r\nvalley in which the oil was found, and uniting with the Allegheny River\r\nat what is now known as Oil City. From this junction it was 132 miles to\r\nPittsburg and a railroad. Besides this waterway were rough country roads\r\nleading to the railroads at Union City, Corry, Erie and Meadville. There\r\nwas but one way to get the oil to the bank of Oil Creek or to the\r\nrailroads, and that was by putting it into barrels and hauling it.\r\nTeamsters equipped for this service seemed to fall from the sky. The\r\nfarms for a hundred miles around gave up their boys and horses and\r\nwagons to supply the need. It paid. There were times when three and even\r\nfour dollars a barrel were paid for hauling five or ten miles. It was\r\nnot too much for the work. The best roads over which they travelled were\r\nnarrow, rough, unmade highways, mere openings to the outer world, while\r\nthe roads to the wells they themselves had to break across fields and\r\nthrough forests. These roads were made almost impassable by the great\r\nnumber of heavily freighted wagons travelling over them. From the big\r\nwells a constant procession of teams ran, and it was no uncommon thing\r\nfor a visitor to the Oil Regions to meet oil caravans of a hundred or\r\nmore wagons. Often these caravans were held up for hours by a dangerous\r\nmud-hole into which a wheel had sunk or a horse fallen. If there was a\r\npossible way to be made around the obstruction it was taken, even if it\r\nled through a farmer’s field. Indeed, a sort of guerilla warfare went on\r\nconstantly between the farmers and the teamsters. Often the roads became\r\nimpassable, so that new ones had to be broken, and not even a shot-gun\r\ncould keep the driver from going where the passage was least difficult.\r\nThe teamster, in fact, carried a weapon which few farmers cared to face,\r\nhis terrible “black snake,” as his long, heavy black whip was called.\r\nThe man who had once felt the cruel lash of a “black snake” around his\r\nlegs did not often oppose the owner.\r\n\r\nWith the wages paid him the teamster could easily become a kind of\r\nplutocrat. One old producer tells of having a teamster in his employ who\r\nfor nine weeks drew only enough of his earnings to feed himself and\r\nhorses. He slept in his wagon and tethered the team. At the end of the\r\ntime he “thought he’d go home for a clean shirt” and asked for a\r\nsettlement. It was found that he had $1,900 to his credit. The story is\r\na fair illustration both of the habits and the earnings of the Oil Creek\r\nteamsters. Indispensable to the business they became the tyrants of the\r\nregion—working and brawling as suited them, a genius not unlike the\r\nflatboat-men who once gave colour to life on the Mississippi, or the\r\ncowboys who make the plains picturesque to-day. Bad as their reputation\r\nwas, many a man found in their ranks the start which led later to wealth\r\nand influence in the oil business. One of the shrewdest, kindest, oddest\r\nmen the Oil Regions ever knew, Wesley Chambers, came to the top from the\r\nteamster class. He had found his way to the creek after eight years of\r\nunsuccessful gold-hunting in California. “There’s my chance,” he said,\r\nwhen he saw the lack of teams and boats, and he set about organising a\r\nservice for transporting oil to Pittsburg. In a short time he was buying\r\nhorses of his own and building boats. Wide-awake to actualities, he saw\r\na few years later that the teamster and the boat were to be replaced by\r\nthe pipe-line and the railroad, and forestalled the change by becoming a\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nIn this problem of transportation the most important element after the\r\nteam was Oil Creek and the flatboat. A more uncertain stream never ran\r\nin a bed. In the summer it was low, in the winter frozen; now it was\r\ngorged with ice, now running mad over the flats. The best service was\r\ngotten out of it in time of low water through artificial freshets.\r\nMilldams, controlled by private parties, were frequent along the creek\r\nand its tributaries. By arrangement these dams were cut on a certain day\r\nor days of the week, usually Friday, and on the flood or freshet the\r\nflatboats loaded with barrels of oil were floated down stream. The\r\nfreshet was always exciting and perilous and frequently disastrous. From\r\nthe points where they were tied up the boatmen watched the coming flood\r\nand cut themselves loose the moment after its head had passed them. As\r\none fleet after another swung into the roaring flood the danger of\r\ncollision and jams increased. Rare indeed was the freshet when a few\r\nwrecks did not lie somewhere along the creek, and often scores lay piled\r\nhigh on the bank—a hopeless jam of broken boats and barrels, the whole\r\nsoaked in petroleum and reeking with gas and profanity. If the boats\r\nrode safely through to the river, there was little further danger.\r\n\r\nThe Allegheny River traffic grew to great proportions—fully 1,000 boats\r\nand some thirty steamers were in the fleet, and at least 4,000 men. This\r\ntraffic was developed by men who saw here their opportunity of fortune,\r\nas others had seen it in drilling or teaming. The foremost of these men\r\nwas an Ohio River captain, driven northward by the war, one J. J.\r\nVandergrift. Captain Vandergrift had run the full gamut of river\r\nexperiences from cabin-boy to owner and commander of his own steamers.\r\nThe war stopped his Mississippi River trade. Fitting up one of his\r\nsteamers as a gun-boat, he turned it over to Commodore Foote and looked\r\nfor a new stream to navigate. From the Oil Region at that moment the\r\nloudest cry was for barrels. He towed 4,000 empty casks up the river,\r\nsaw at once the need of some kind of bulk transportation, took his hint\r\nfrom a bulk-boat which an ingenious experimenter was trying, ordered a\r\ndozen of them built, towed his fleet to the creek, bought oil to fill\r\nthem, and then returned to Pittsburg to sell his cargo. On one alone he\r\nmade $70,000.\r\n\r\nBut the railroad soon pressed the river hard. At the time of the\r\ndiscovery of oil three lines, the Philadelphia and Erie, the Buffalo and\r\nErie (now the Lake Shore), connecting with the Central, and the Atlantic\r\nand Great Western, connecting with the Erie, were within teaming\r\ndistance of the region. The points at which the Philadelphia and Erie\r\nroad could be reached were Erie, forty miles from Titusville, Union\r\nCity, twenty-two miles, and Corry, sixteen miles. The Buffalo and Erie\r\nwas reached at Erie. The Atlantic and Great Western was reached at\r\nMeadville, Union City and Corry, and the distances were twenty-eight,\r\ntwenty-two and sixteen miles, respectively. Erie was the favourite\r\nshipping point at first, as the wagon road in that direction was the\r\nbest. The amount of freight the railroads carried the first year of the\r\nbusiness was enormous. Of course connecting lines were built as rapidly\r\nas men could work. By the beginning of 1863 the Oil Creek road, as it\r\nwas known, had reached Titusville from Corry. This gave an eastern\r\nconnection by both the Philadelphia and Erie and the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern, but as the latter was constructing a branch from Meadville to\r\nFranklin, the Oil Creek road became the feeder of the former\r\nprincipally. Both of these roads were completed to Oil City by 1865.\r\n\r\nThe railroads built, the vexatious, time-taking, and costly problem of\r\ngetting the oil from the well to the shipping point still remained. The\r\nteamster was still the tyrant of the business. His day was almost over.\r\nHe was to fall before the pipe-line. The feasibility of carrying oil in\r\npipes was discussed almost from the beginning of the oil business. Very\r\nsoon after the Drake well was struck oil men began to say that the\r\nnatural way to get this oil from the wells to the railroads was through\r\npipes. In many places gravity would carry it; where it could not, pumps\r\nwould force it. The belief that this could be done was so strong that as\r\nearly as February, 1862, a company was incorporated in Pennsylvania for\r\ncarrying oil in pipes or tubes from any point on Oil Creek to its mouth\r\nor to any station on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. This company\r\nseems never to have done more than get a charter. In 1863 at least three\r\nshort pipe-lines were put into operation. The first of these was a\r\ntwo–inch pipe, through which distillate was pumped a distance of three\r\nmiles from the Warren refinery at Plumer to Warren’s Landing on the\r\nAllegheny River. The one which attracted the most attention was a line\r\ntwo and one-half miles in length carrying crude oil from the Tarr farm\r\nto the Humboldt refinery at Plumer. Various other experiments were made,\r\nboth gravity and pumps being trusted for propelling the oil, but there\r\nwas always something wrong; the pipes leaked or burst, the pumps were\r\ntoo weak; shifting oil centres interrupted experiments which might have\r\nbeen successful. Then suddenly the man for the need appeared, Samuel Van\r\nSyckel. He came to the creek in 1864 with some money, hoping to make\r\nmore. He handled quantities of oil produced at Pithole, several miles\r\nfrom a shipping point, and saw his profits eaten up by teamsters. Their\r\ntyranny aroused his ire and his wits and he determined to build a\r\npipe-line from the wells to the railroad. He was greeted with jeers, but\r\nhe went doggedly ahead, laid a two–inch pipe, put in three relay pumps,\r\nand turned in his oil. From the start the line was a success, carrying\r\neighty barrels of oil an hour. The day that the Van Syckel pipe-line\r\nbegan to run oil a revolution began in the business. After the Drake\r\nwell it is the most important event in the history of the Oil Regions.\r\n\r\nThe teamsters saw its meaning first and turned out in fury, dragging the\r\npipe, which was for the most part buried, to the surface, and cutting it\r\nso that the oil would be lost. It was only by stationing an armed guard\r\nthat they were held in check. A second line of importance, that of\r\nAbbott and Harley, suffered even more than that of Van Syckel. The\r\nteamsters did more than cut the pipe; they burned the tanks in which oil\r\nwas stored, laid in wait for employees, threatened with destruction the\r\nwells which furnished the oil, and so generally terrorised the country\r\nthat the governor of the state was called upon in April, 1866, to\r\nprotect the property and men of the lines. The day of the teamster was\r\nover, however, and the more philosophical of them accepted the\r\nsituation; scores disappeared from the region, and scores more took to\r\ndrilling. They died hard, and the cutting and plugging of pipe-lines was\r\nfor years a pastime of the remnant of their race.\r\n\r\nIf the uses to which oil might be put and the methods for manufacturing\r\nit had not been well understood when the Drake well was struck, there\r\nwould have been no such imperious demand as came for the immediate\r\nopening of new territory and developing methods of handling and carrying\r\nit on a large scale. But men knew already what the oil was good for,\r\nand, in a crude way, how to distil it. The process of distillation also\r\nwas free to all. The essential apparatus was very simple—a cast-iron\r\nstill, usually surrounded by brickwork, a copper worm, and two tin- or\r\nzinc-lined tanks. The still was filled with crude oil, which was\r\nsubjected to a high enough heat to vapourise it. The vapour passed\r\nthrough a cast-iron goose-neck fitted to the top of the still into the\r\ncopper worm, which was immersed in water. Here the vapour was condensed\r\nand passed into the zinc-lined tank. This product, called a distillate,\r\nwas treated with chemicals, washed with water, and run off into the\r\ntin-lined tank, where it was allowed to settle. Anybody who could get\r\nthe apparatus could “make oil,” and many men did—badly, of course, to\r\nbegin with, and with an alarming proportion of waste and explosions and\r\nfires, but with experience they learned, and some of the great\r\nrefineries of the country grew out of these rude beginnings.\r\n\r\nLuckily not all the men who undertook the manufacturing of petroleum in\r\nthese first days were inexperienced. The chemists to whom are due\r\nchiefly the processes now used—Atwood, Gessner, and Merrill—had for\r\nyears been busy making oils from coal. They knew something of petroleum,\r\nand when it came in quantities began at once to adapt their processes to\r\nit. Merrill at the time was connected with Samuel Downer, of Boston, in\r\nmanufacturing oil from Trinidad pitch and from coal bought in\r\nNewfoundland. The year oil was discovered Mr. Downer distilled 7,500\r\ntons of this coal, clearing on it at least $100,000. As soon as\r\npetroleum appeared he and Mr. Merrill saw that here was a product which\r\nwas bound to displace their coal, and with courage and promptness they\r\nprepared to adapt their works. In order to be near the supply they came\r\nto Corry, fourteen miles from the Drake well, and in 1862 put up a\r\nrefinery which cost $250,000. Here were refined thousands of barrels of\r\noil, most of which was sent to New York for export. To the Boston works\r\nthe firm sent crude, which was manufactured for the home trade and for\r\nshipping to California and Australia. The processes used in the Downer\r\nworks at this early day were in all essentials the same as are used\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 William Wright, after a careful study of “Petrolia,” as the Oil\r\nRegions were then often called, published with Harper and Brothers an\r\ninteresting volume in which he devotes a chapter to “Oil Refining and\r\nRefiners.” Mr. Wright describes there not only the Downer works at\r\nCorry, but a factory which if much less important in the development of\r\nthe Oil Regions held a much larger place in its imagination. This was\r\nthe Humboldt works at Plumer. In 1862 two Germans, brothers, the Messrs.\r\nLudovici, came to the oil country and, choosing a spot distant from oil\r\nwells, main roads, or water courses, erected an oil refinery which was\r\nreported to have cost a half million dollars. The works were built in a\r\nway unheard of then and uncommon now. The foundations were all of cut\r\nstone. The boiler and engines were of the most expensive character. A\r\nhouse erected in connection with the refinery was said to have been\r\nfinished in hard wood with marble mantels, and furnished with rich\r\ncarpets, mirrors, and elaborate furniture. The lavishness of the\r\nHumboldt refinery and the formality with which its business was\r\nconducted were long a tradition in the Oil Regions. Of more practical\r\nmoment are the features of the refinery which Mr. Wright mentions: one\r\nis that the works had been so planned as to take advantage of the\r\nnatural descent of the ground so that the oil would pass from one set of\r\nvessels to another without using artificial power, and the other that\r\nthe supply of crude oil was obtained from the Tarr farm three miles\r\naway, being forced by pumps, through pipes, over the hills.\r\n\r\nMr. Wright found some twenty refineries between Titusville and Oil City\r\nthe year of his visit, 1865. In several factories that he visited they\r\nwere making naphtha, gasoline, and benzine for export. Three grades of\r\nilluminating oils—“prime white,” “standard white,” and “straw\r\ncolour”—were made everywhere; paraffine, refined to a pure white article\r\nlike that of to-day, was manufactured in quantities by the Downer works;\r\nand lubricating oils were beginning to be made.\r\n\r\nAs men and means were found to put down wells, to devise and build tanks\r\nand boats and pipes and railroads for handling the oil, to adapt and\r\nimprove processes for manufacturing, so men were found from the\r\nbeginning of the oil business to wrestle with every problem raised. They\r\ncame in shoals, young, vigorous, resourceful, indifferent to\r\ndifficulties, greedy for a chance, and with each year they forced more\r\nlight and wealth from the new product. By the opening of 1872 they had\r\nproduced nearly 40,000,000 barrels of oil, and had raised their product\r\nto the fourth place among the exports of the United States, over\r\n152,000,000 gallons going abroad in 1871, a percentage of the production\r\nwhich compares well with what goes to-day.[3] As for the market, they\r\nhad developed it until it included almost every country of the\r\nearth—China, the East and West Indies, South America and Africa. Over\r\nforty different European ports received refined oil from the United\r\nStates in 1871. Nearly a million gallons were sent to Syria, about a\r\nhalf million to Egypt, about as much to the British West Indies, and a\r\nquarter of a million to the Dutch East Indies. Not only were\r\nilluminating oils being exported. In 1871 nearly seven million gallons\r\nof naphtha, benzine, and gasoline were sent abroad, and it became\r\nevident now for the first time that a valuable trade in lubricants made\r\nfrom petroleum was possible. A discovery by Joshua Merrill of the Downer\r\nworks opened this new source of wealth to the industry. Until 1869 the\r\nimpossibility of deodorising petroleum had prevented its use largely as\r\na lubricant, but in that year Mr. Merrill discovered a process by which\r\na deodorised lubricating oil could be made. He had both the apparatus\r\nfor producing the oil and the oil itself patented. The oil was so\r\nfavourably received that the market sale by the Downer works was several\r\nhundred per cent. greater in a single year than the firm had ever sold\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe oil field had been extended from the valley of Oil Creek and its\r\ntributaries down the Allegheny River for fifty miles and probably\r\ncovered 2,000 square miles. The early theory that oil followed the\r\nstreams had been exploded, and wells were now drilled on the hills. It\r\nwas known, too, that if oil was found in the first sand struck in the\r\ndrilling, it might be found still lower in a second or third sand. The\r\nDrake well had struck oil at 69½ feet, but wells were now drilled as\r\ndeep as 1,600 feet. The extension of the field, the discovery that oil\r\nwas under the hills as well as under streams, and to be found in various\r\nsands, had cost enormously. It had been done by “wild-catting,” as\r\nputting down experimental wells was called, by following superstitions\r\nin locating wells, such as the witch-hazel stick, or the spiritualistic\r\nmedium, quite as much as by studying the position of wells in existence\r\nand calculating how oil belts probably ran. As the cost of a well was\r\nfrom $3,000 to $8,000,[4] according to its location, and as 4,374 of the\r\n5,560 wells drilled in the first ten years of the business (1859 to\r\n1869) were “dry-holes,” or were abandoned as unprofitable, something of\r\nthe daring it took to operate on small means, as most producers did in\r\nthe beginning, is evident. But they loved the game, and every man of\r\nthem would stake his last dollar on the chance of striking oil.\r\n\r\nWith the extension of the field rapid strides had been made in tools, in\r\nrigs, in all of the various essentials of drilling a well. They had\r\nlearned to use torpedoes to open up hard rocks, naphtha to cut the\r\nparaffine which coated the sand and stopped the flow of oil, seed bags\r\nto stop the inrush of a stream of water. They lost their tools less\r\noften, and knew better how to fish for them when they did. In short,\r\nthey had learned how to put down and care for oil wells.\r\n\r\nEqual advances had been made in other departments, fewer cars were\r\nloaded with barrels, tank cars for carrying in bulk had been invented.\r\nThe wooden tank holding 200 to 1,200 barrels had been rapidly replaced\r\nby the great iron tank holding 20,000 or 30,000 barrels. The pipe-lines\r\nhad begun to go directly to the wells instead of pumping from a general\r\nreceiving station, or “dump,” as it was called, thus saving the tedious\r\nand expensive operation of hauling. From beginning to end the business\r\nhad been developed, systematised, simplified.\r\n\r\nMost important was the simplification of the transportation problem by\r\nthe development of pipe-lines. By 1872 they were the one oil gatherer.\r\nSeveral companies were carrying on the pipe-line business, and two of\r\nthem had acquired great power in the Oil Regions because of their\r\nconnection with trunk lines. These were the Empire Transportation\r\nCompany and the Pennsylvania Transportation Company. The former, which\r\nhad been the first business organisation to go into the pipe-line\r\nbusiness on a large scale, was a concern which had appeared in the Oil\r\nRegions not over six months before Van Syckel began to pump oil. The\r\nEmpire Transportation Company had been organised in 1865 to build up an\r\neast and west freight traffic _via_ the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad,\r\na new line which had just been leased by the Pennsylvania. Some ten\r\nrailroads connected in one way or another with the Philadelphia and\r\nErie, forming direct routes east and west. In spite of their evident\r\ncommunity of interest these various roads were kept apart by their\r\njealous fears of one another. Each insisted on its own time-table, its\r\nown rates, its own way of doing things. The shipper _via_ this route\r\nmust make a separate bargain with each road and often submit to having\r\nhis freight changed at terminals from one car to another because of the\r\ndifference of gauge. The Empire Transportation Company undertook to act\r\nas a mediator between the roads and the shipper, to make the route\r\ncheap, fast, and reliable. It proposed to solicit freight, furnish its\r\nown cars and terminal facilities, and collect money due. It did not make\r\nrates, however; it only harmonised those made by the various branches in\r\nthe system. It was to receive a commission on the business secured, and\r\na rental for the cars and other facilities it furnished.\r\n\r\nIt was a difficult task the new company undertook, but it had at its\r\nhead a remarkable man to cope with difficulties. This man, Joseph D.\r\nPotts, was in 1865 thirty-six years old. He had come of a long and\r\nhonourable line of iron-masters of the Schuylkill region of\r\nPennsylvania, but had left the great forge towns with which his\r\nancestors had been associated—Pottstown, Glasgow Forge, Valley Forge—to\r\nbecome a civil engineer. His profession had led him to the service of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, where he had held important positions in\r\nconnection with which he now undertook the organisation of the Empire\r\nTransportation Company. Colonel Potts—the title came from his service in\r\nthe Civil War—possessed a clear and vigorous mind; he was far-seeing,\r\nforceful in execution, fair in his dealings. To marked ability and\r\nintegrity he joined a gentle and courteous nature.\r\n\r\nThe first freight which the Empire Transportation Company attacked after\r\nits organisation was oil. The year was a great one for the Oil Regions,\r\nthe year of Pithole. In January there had suddenly been struck on\r\nPithole Creek in a wilderness six miles from the Allegheny River a well,\r\nlocated with a witch-hazel twig, which produced 250 barrels a day—and\r\noil was selling at eight dollars a barrel! Wells followed in rapid\r\nsuccession. In less than ten months the field was doing over 10,000\r\nbarrels a day. This sudden flood of oil caused a tremendous excitement.\r\nCrowds of speculators and investors rushed to Pithole from all over the\r\ncountry. The Civil War had just closed, soldiers were disbanding, and\r\nhundreds of them found their way to the new oil field. In six weeks\r\nafter the first well was struck Pithole was a town of 6,000 inhabitants.\r\nIn less than a year it had fifty hotels and boardinghouses; five of\r\nthese hotels cost $50,000 or more each. In six months after the first\r\nwell the post-office of Pithole was receiving upwards of 10,000 letters\r\nper day and was counted third in size in the state—Philadelphia,\r\nPittsburg, and Pithole being the order of rank. It had a daily paper,\r\nchurches, all the appliances of a town.\r\n\r\nThe handling of the great output of oil from the Pithole field was a\r\nserious question. There seemed not enough cars in the country to carry\r\nit and shippers resorted to every imaginable trick to get\r\naccommodations. When the agent of the Empire Transportation Company\r\nopened his office in June, 1865, and demonstrated his ability to furnish\r\ncars regularly and in large numbers, trade rapidly flowed to him. Now\r\nthe Empire agency had hardly been established when the Van Syckel\r\npipe-line began to carry oil from Pithole to the railroad. Lines began\r\nto multiply. The railroads saw at once that they were destined speedily\r\nto do all the gathering and hastened to secure control of them. Colonel\r\nPotts’s first pipe-line purchase was a line running from Pithole to\r\nTitusville, which as yet had not been wet.\r\n\r\nWhen the Empire Transportation Company took over this line nothing had\r\nbeen demonstrated but that oil could be driven, by relay pumps, five\r\nmiles through a two–inch pipe. The Empire’s first effort was to get a\r\nlonger run by fewer pumps. The agent in charge, C. P. Hatch, believed\r\nthat oil could be brought the entire ten and one-half miles from Pithole\r\nto Titusville by one pump. He met with ridicule, but he insisted on\r\ntrying it in the new line his company had acquired. The experiment was\r\nentirely successful. Improvements followed as rapidly as hands could\r\ncarry out the suggestions of ingenuity and energy. One of the most\r\nimportant made the first year of the business was connecting wells by\r\npipe directly with the tanks at the pumping stations, thus doing away\r\nwith the expensive hauling in barrels to the “dump.” A new device for\r\naccounting to the producer for his oil was made necessary by this\r\nchange, and the practice of taking the gauge or measure of the oil in\r\nthe producer’s tank before and after the run and issuing duplicate “run\r\ntickets” was devised by Mr. Hatch. The producers, however, were not all\r\n“square”; it sometimes happened that they sold oil by a transfer order\r\non the pipe-line, which they did not have in the line! To prevent these\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company in 1868 began to issue certificates\r\nfor credit balances of oil; these soon became the general mediums of\r\ntrade in oil, and remain so to-day.\r\n\r\nOne of the cleverest of the pipe-line devices of the Empire Company was\r\nits assessment for waste and fire. In running oil through pipes there is\r\nmore or less lost by leaking and evaporation. In September, 1868, Mr.\r\nHatch announced that thereafter he would deduct two per cent. from oil\r\nruns for wastage. The assessment raised almost a riot in the region,\r\nmeetings were held, the Empire Transportation Company was denounced as a\r\nhighway robber, and threats of violence were made if the order was\r\nenforced. While this excitement was in progress there came a big fire on\r\nthe line. Now the company’s officials had been studying the question of\r\nfire insurance from the start. Fires in the Oil Regions were as regular\r\na feature of the business as explosions used to be on the Mississippi\r\nsteamboats, and no regular fire insurance company would take the risk.\r\nIt had been decided that at the first fire there should be announced\r\nwhat was called a “general average assessment,” that is, a fire tax, and\r\nto be ready, blanks had been prepared. Now in the thick of the\r\nresistance to the wastage assessment came a fire and the line announced\r\nthat the producers having oil in the line must pay the insurance. The\r\ncontroversy at once waxed hotter than ever, but was finally compromised\r\nby the withdrawal in this case of the fire insurance if the producers\r\nwould consent to the tax for waste. They did consent, and later when\r\nfires occurred the general average assessment was applied without\r\nserious opposition. Both of these practices prevail to-day. By the end\r\nof 1871 the Empire Transportation Company was one of the most efficient\r\nand respected business organisations in the oil country.\r\n\r\nIts chief rival was the Pennsylvania Transportation Company, an\r\norganisation which had its origin in the second pipe-line laid in the\r\nOil Regions. This line was built by Henry Harley, a man who for fully\r\nten years was one of the most brilliant figures in the oil country.\r\nHarley was a civil engineer by profession, a graduate of the Troy\r\nPolytechnic Institute, and had held a responsible position for some time\r\nas an assistant of General Herman Haupt in the Hoosac Tunnel. He became\r\ninterested in the oil business in 1862, first as a buyer of petroleum,\r\nthen as an operator in West Virginia. In 1865 he laid a pipe-line from\r\none of the rich oil farms of the creek to the railroad. It was a\r\nsuccess, and from this venture Harley and his partner, W. H. Abbott, one\r\nof the wealthiest and most active men in the country, developed an\r\nimportant transportation system. In 1868 Jay Gould, who as president of\r\nthe Erie road was eager to increase his oil freight, bought a\r\ncontrolling interest in the Abbott and Harley lines, and made Harley\r\n“General Oil Agent” of the Erie system. Harley now became closely\r\nassociated with Fisk and Gould, and the three carried on a series of\r\nbold and piratical speculations in oil which greatly enraged the oil\r\ncountry. They built a refinery near Jersey City, extended their\r\npipe-line system, and in 1871, when they reorganised under the name of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Transportation Company, they controlled probably the\r\ngreatest number of miles of pipe of any company in the region, and then\r\nwere fighting the Empire bitterly for freight.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of this rapid development of the business more\r\ninteresting than the commercial machine the oil men had devised by 1872\r\nfor marketing oil. A man with a thousand-barrel well on his hands in\r\n1862 was in a plight. He had got to sell his oil at once for lack of\r\nstorage room or let it run on the ground, and there was no exchange, no\r\nmarket, no telegraph, not even a post-office within his reach where he\r\ncould arrange a sale. He had to depend on buyers who came to him. These\r\nbuyers were the agents of the refineries in different cities, or of the\r\nexporters of crude in New York. They went from well to well on\r\nhorseback, if the roads were not too bad, on foot if they were, and at\r\neach place made a special bargain varying with the quantity bought and\r\nthe difficulty in getting it away, for the buyer was the transporter,\r\nand, as a rule, furnished the barrels or boats in which he carried off\r\nhis oil. It was not long before the speculative character of the oil\r\ntrade due to the great fluctuations in quantity added a crowd of brokers\r\nto the regular buyers who tramped up and down the creek. When the\r\nrailroads came in the trains became the headquarters for both buyers and\r\nsellers. This was the more easily managed as the trains on the creek\r\nstopped at almost every oil farm. These trains became, in fact, a sort\r\nof travelling oil exchange, and on them a large percentage of all the\r\nbargaining of the business was done.\r\n\r\nThe brokers and buyers first organised and established headquarters in\r\nOil City in 1869, but there was an oil exchange in New York City as\r\nearly as 1866. Titusville did not have an exchange until 1871. By this\r\ntime the pipe-lines had begun to issue certificates for the oil they\r\nreceived, and the trading was done to a degree in these. The method was\r\nsimple, and much more convenient than the old one. The producer ran his\r\noil into a pipe-line, and for it received a certificate showing that the\r\nline held so much to his credit; this certificate was transferred when\r\nthe sale was made and presented when the oil was wanted.\r\n\r\nOne achievement of which the oil men were particularly proud was\r\nincreasing the refining capacity of the region. At the start the\r\ndifficulty of getting the apparatus for a refinery to the creek had been\r\nso enormous that the bulk of the crude had been driven to the nearest\r\nmanufacturing cities—Erie, Pittsburg, Cleveland. Much had gone to the\r\nseaboard, too, and Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore were all\r\ndoing considerable refining. There was always a strong feeling in the\r\nOil Regions that the refining should be done at home. Before the\r\nrailroads came the most heroic efforts were made again and again to get\r\nin the necessary machinery. Brought from Pittsburg by water, as a rule,\r\nthe apparatus had to be hauled from Oil City, where it had been dumped\r\non the muddy bank of the river—there were no wharfs—over the\r\nindescribable roads to the site chosen. It took weeks—months\r\nsometimes—to get in the apparatus. The chemicals used in the making of\r\nthe oil, the barrels in which to store it—all had to be brought from\r\noutside. The wonder is that under these conditions anybody tried to\r\nrefine on the creek. But refineries persisted in coming, and after the\r\nrailroads came, increased; by 1872 the daily capacity had grown to\r\nnearly 10,000 barrels, and there were no more complete or profitable\r\nplants in existence than two or three of those on the creek. The only\r\npoints having larger daily capacity were Cleveland and New York City.\r\nSeveral of the refineries had added barrel works. Acids were made on the\r\nground. Iron works at Oil City and Titusville promised soon to supply\r\nthe needs of both drillers and refiners. The exultation was great, and\r\nthe press and people boasted that the day would soon come when they\r\nwould refine for the world. There in their own narrow valleys should be\r\nmade everything which petroleum would yield. Cleveland, Pittsburg—the\r\nseaboard—must give up refining. The business belonged to the Oil\r\nRegions, and the oil men meant to take it.\r\n\r\nA significant development in the region was the tendency among many of\r\nthe oil men to combine different branches of the business. Several large\r\nproducers conducted shipping agencies for handling their own and other\r\npeople’s oil. The firm of Pierce and Neyhart was a prominent one\r\ncarrying on this double business in the sixties and early seventies. J.\r\nJ. Vandergrift, who has been mentioned already as one of the first men\r\nto take hold of the transportation problem, early became interested in\r\nproduction. As soon as the pipe-line was demonstrated to be a success he\r\nbegan building lines. He also added to his interests a large refinery,\r\nthe Imperial of Oil City. Captain Vandergrift by 1870 produced,\r\ntransported and refined his own oil as well as transported and refined\r\nmuch of other people’s. It was a common practice for a refinery in the\r\nOil Regions to pipe oil directly to its works by its own line, and in\r\n1872 one refinery in Titusville, the Octave, carried its refined oil a\r\nmile or more by pipe to the railroad. Although most of the refineries at\r\nthis period sold their products to dealers and exporters, the building\r\nup of markets by direct contact with new territory was beginning to be a\r\nconsideration with all large manufacturers. The Octave of Titusville,\r\nfor instance, chartered a ship in 1872 to load with oil and send in\r\ncharge of its own agent into South American ports.\r\n\r\nThe odds against the oil men in developing the business had not been\r\nmerely physical ones. There had been more than the wilderness to\r\nconquer, more than the possibilities of a new product to learn. Over all\r\nthe early years of their struggle and hardships hovered the dark cloud\r\nof the Civil War. They were so cut off from men that they did not hear\r\nof the fall of Sumter for four days after it happened, and the news for\r\nthe time blotted out interest even in flowing wells. Twice at least when\r\nLee invaded Pennsylvania the whole business came to a stand-still, men\r\nabandoning the drill, the pump, the refinery to make ready to repel the\r\ninvader. They were taxed for the war—taxes rising to ten dollars per\r\nbarrel in 1865—one dollar on crude and twenty cents a gallon on refined\r\n(the oil barrel is usually estimated at forty-two gallons). They gave up\r\ntheir quota of men again and again at the call for recruits, and when\r\nthe end came and a million men were cast on the country, this little\r\ncorner of Pennsylvania absorbed a larger portion of men probably than\r\nany other spot in the United States. The soldier was given the first\r\nchance everywhere at work, he was welcomed into oil companies, stock\r\nbeing given him for the value of his war record. There were lieutenants\r\nand captains and majors—even generals—scattered all over the field, and\r\nthe field felt itself honoured, and bragged, as it did of all things, of\r\nthe number of privates and officers who immediately on disbandment had\r\nturned to it for employment.\r\n\r\nIt was not only the Civil War from which the Oil Regions had suffered;\r\nin 1870 the Franco-Prussian War broke the foreign market to pieces and\r\ncaused great loss to the whole industry. And there had been other\r\ntroubles. From the first, oil men had to contend with wild fluctuations\r\nin the price of oil. In 1859 it was twenty dollars a barrel, and in 1861\r\nit had averaged fifty-two cents. Two years later, in 1863, it averaged\r\n$8.15, and in 1867 but $2.40. In all these first twelve years nothing\r\nlike a steady price could be depended on, for just as the supply seemed\r\nto have approached a fixed amount, a “wildcat” well would come in and\r\n“knock the bottom out of the market.” Such fluctuations were the natural\r\nelement of the speculator, and he came early, buying in quantities and\r\nholding in storage tanks for higher prices. If enough oil was held, or\r\nif the production fell off, up went the price, only to be knocked down\r\nby the throwing of great quantities of stocks on the market. The\r\nproducers themselves often held their oil, though not always to their\r\nown profit. A historic case of obstinate holding occurred in 1871 on the\r\n“McCray farm,” the most productive field in the region at that time.\r\nPrices were hovering around three dollars, and McCray swore he would not\r\nsell under five dollars. He bought, hired and built iron tankage until\r\nhe had upward of 200,000 barrels. There was great loss from leakage and\r\nfrom evaporation and there were taxes, but McCray held on, refusing four\r\ndollars, $4.50, and even five dollars. Evil times came in the Oil\r\nRegions soon after and with them “dollar oil.” McCray finally was\r\nobliged to sell his stocks at about $1.20 per barrel. To develop a\r\nbusiness in face of such fluctuations and speculation in the raw product\r\ntook not only courage—it took a dash of the gambler. It never could have\r\nbeen done, of course, had it not been for the streams of money which\r\nflowed unceasingly and apparently from choice into the regions. In 1865\r\nMr. Wright calculated that the oil country was using a capital of\r\n$100,000,000. In 1872 the oil men claimed the capital in operation was\r\n$200,000,000. It has been estimated that in the first decade of the\r\nindustry nearly $350,000,000 was put into it.\r\n\r\nSpeculation in oil stock companies was another great evil. It reached\r\nits height in 1864 and 1865—the “flush times” of the business. Stocks in\r\ncompanies whose holdings were hardly worth the stamps on the\r\ncertificates were sold all over the land. In March, 1865, the aggregate\r\ncapital of the oil companies whose charters were on file in Albany, New\r\nYork, was $350,000,000, and in Philadelphia alone in 1864 and 1865 1,000\r\noil companies, mostly bogus, are said to have been formed. These\r\nswindles were dignified by the names of officers of distinction in the\r\nUnited States army, for the war was coming to an end and the name of a\r\ngeneral was the most popular and persuasive argument in the country. Of\r\ncourse there came a collapse. The “oil bubble” burst in 1866, and it was\r\nnothing but the irrepressible energy of the region which kept the\r\nbusiness going in the panic which followed.\r\n\r\nThen there was the disturbing effect of foreign competition. What would\r\nbecome of them if oil was found in quantities in other countries? A\r\ndecided depression of the market occurred in 1866 when the government\r\nsent out reports of developments of foreign oil fields. If there was oil\r\nin Japan, China, Burmah, Persia, Russia, Bavaria, in the quantities the\r\ngovernment reports said, why, there was trouble in store for\r\nPennsylvania, the oil men argued, and for a day the market fell—it was\r\nonly for a day. Men forgot easily in the Oil Regions in the sixties.\r\n\r\nAn evil in their business which they were only beginning to grasp fully\r\nin 1871 was the unholy system of freight discrimination which the\r\nrailroads were practising. Three trunk lines competed for the business\r\nby 1872—the Pennsylvania, which had leased the Philadelphia and Erie,\r\nthe Erie and the Central. (The latter road reached the Oil Regions by a\r\nbranch from Ashtabula on the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern division\r\nto Oil City; this branch was completed in 1868.) The Pennsylvania\r\nclaimed the oil traffic as a natural right; for the Oil Regions were in\r\nPennsylvania, and did not Tom Scott own that state? The Erie road for\r\nabout five years had been in the hands of those splendid pirates, Jay\r\nGould and “Jim” Fisk. Naturally they took all they could get of the oil\r\ntraffic and took it by freebooting methods. “Corners” and “rings” were\r\ntheir favourite devices for securing trade, and more than once their aid\r\nhad carried through daring and unscrupulous speculations in oil. The\r\nCentral in this period was waging its famous desperate war on the Erie,\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt having marked that highway for his own along with\r\nmost other things in New York State. All three of the roads began as\r\nearly as 1868 to use secret rebates on the published freight rates in\r\noil as a means of securing traffic. This practice had gone on until in\r\n1871 any big producer, refiner, or buyer could bully a freight agent\r\ninto a special rate. Those “on the inside,” those who had “pulls,” also\r\nsecured special rates. The result was that the open rate was enforced\r\nonly on the innocent and the weak.\r\n\r\nSerious as all these problems were, there was no discouragement or\r\nshrinking from them. The oil men had rid themselves of bunco men and\r\nburst the “oil bubbles.” They had harnessed the brokers in exchanges and\r\nmade strict rules to govern them. They had learned not to fear the\r\nforeigners, and to take with equal _sang froid_ the “dry-hole” which\r\nmade them poor, or the “gusher” which made them rich. For every evil\r\nthey had a remedy. They were not afraid even of the railroads, and\r\nloudly declared that if the discriminations were not stopped they would\r\nbuild a railroad of their own. Indeed, the evils in the oil business in\r\n1871, far from being a discouragement, rather added to the interest.\r\nThey had never known anything but struggle—with conquest—and twelve\r\nyears of it was far from cooling their ardour for a fair fight.\r\n\r\nMore had been done in the Oil Regions in the first dozen years than the\r\ndevelopment of a new industry. From the first there had gone with the\r\noil men’s ambition to make oil to light the whole earth a desire to\r\nbring civilisation to the wilderness from which they were drawing\r\nwealth, to create an orderly society from the mass of humanity which\r\npoured pell-mell into the region. A hatred of indecency first drew\r\ntogether the better element of each of the rough communities which\r\nsprang up. Whiskey-sellers and women flocked to the region at the\r\nbreaking out of the excitement. Their first shelters were shanties built\r\non flatboats which were towed from place to place: They came to\r\nRouseville—a collection of pine shanties and oil derricks, built on a\r\nmuddy flat—as forlorn and disreputable a town in appearance as the earth\r\never saw. They tied up for trade, and the next morning woke up from\r\ntheir brawl to find themselves twenty miles away, floating down the\r\nAllegheny River. Rouseville meant to be decent. She had cut them loose,\r\nand by such summary vigilance she kept herself decent. Other towns\r\nadopted the same policy. By common consent vice was corralled largely in\r\none town. Here a whole street was given up to dance-houses and saloons,\r\nand those who must have a “spree” were expected to go to Petroleum\r\nCentre to take it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FAC-SIMILE OF A LABEL USED BY S. M. KIER IN ADVERTISING ROCK-OIL\r\n    OBTAINED IN DRILLING SALT WELLS NEAR TARENTUM, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FAGUNDUS—A TYPICAL OIL TOWN\r\n]\r\n\r\nDecency and schools! Vice cut adrift, they looked for a school teacher.\r\nChildren were sadly out of place, but there they were, and these men,\r\nfighting for a chance, saw to it that a shanty, with a school teacher in\r\nit, was in every settlement. It was not long, too, before there was a\r\nchurch, a union church. To worship God was their primal instinct; to\r\ndefend a creed a later development. In the beginning every social\r\ncontrivance was wanting. There were no policemen, and each individual\r\nlooked after evil-doers. There were no firemen, and every man turned out\r\nwith a bucket at a fire. There were no bankers, and each man had to put\r\nhis wealth away as best he could until a peripatetic banker from\r\nPittsburg relieved him. At one time Dr. Egbert, a rich operator, is said\r\nto have had $1,800,000 in currency in his house. There were no\r\nhospitals, and in 1861, when the horrible possibilities of the oil fire\r\nwere first demonstrated by the burning of the Rouse well, a fire at\r\nwhich nineteen persons lost their lives, the many injured found welcome\r\nand care for long weeks in the little shanties of women already\r\noverburdened by the difficulties of caring for families in the rough\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nOut of this poverty and disorder they had developed in ten years a\r\nsocial organisation as good as their commercial. Titusville, the hamlet\r\non whose outskirts Drake had drilled his well, was now a city of 10,000\r\ninhabitants. It had an opera house, where in 1871 Clara Louise Kellogg\r\nand Christine Nilsson sang, Joe Jefferson and Janauschek played, and\r\nWendell Phillips and Bishop Simpson spoke. It had two prosperous and\r\nfearless newspapers. Its schools prepared for college. Oil City was not\r\nbehind, and between them was a string of lively towns. Many of the oil\r\nfarms had a decent community life. The Columbia farm kept up a library\r\nand reading-room for its employees; there was a good schoolhouse used on\r\nSunday for services, and there was a Columbia farm band of no mean\r\nreputation in the Oil Regions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, by the opening of 1872, life in the Oil Regions had ceased to be\r\na mere make-shift. Comforts and orderliness and decency, even\r\nopportunities for education and for social life, were within reach. It\r\nwas a conquest to be proud of, quite as proud of as they were of the\r\nfact that their business had been developed until it had never before,\r\non the whole, been in so satisfactory a condition.\r\n\r\nNobody realised more fully what had been accomplished in the Oil Regions\r\nthan the oil men themselves. Nobody rehearsed their achievements so\r\nloudly. “In ten years,” they were fond of saying, “we have built this\r\nbusiness up from nothing to a net product of six millions of barrels per\r\nannum. We have invented and devised all the apparatus, the appliances,\r\nthe forms needed for a new industry. We use a capital of $200,000,000,\r\nand support a population of 60,000 people. To keep up our supply we\r\ndrill 100 new wells per month, at an average cost of $6,000 each. We are\r\nfourth in the exports of the United States. We have developed a foreign\r\nmarket, including every civilised country on the globe.”\r\n\r\nBut what had been done was, in their judgment, only a beginning. Life\r\nran swift and ruddy and joyous in these men. They were still young, most\r\nof them under forty, and they looked forward with all the eagerness of\r\nthe young who have just learned their powers, to years of struggle and\r\ndevelopment. They would solve all these perplexing problems of\r\nover-production, of railroad discrimination, of speculation. They would\r\nmeet their own needs. They would bring the oil refining to the region\r\nwhere it belonged. They would make their towns the most beautiful in the\r\nworld. There was nothing too good for them, nothing they did not hope\r\nand dare. But suddenly, at the very heyday of this confidence, a big\r\nhand reached out from nobody knew where, to steal their conquest and\r\nthrottle their future. The suddenness and the blackness of the assault\r\non their business stirred to the bottom their manhood and their sense of\r\nfair play, and the whole region arose in a revolt which is scarcely\r\nparalleled in the commercial history of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TWO\r\n                  THE RISE OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER’S FIRST CONNECTION WITH THE OIL BUSINESS—STORIES\r\n    OF HIS EARLY LIFE IN CLEVELAND—HIS FIRST PARTNERS—ORGANISATION OF\r\n    THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY IN JUNE, 1870—ROCKEFELLER’S ABLE\r\n    ASSOCIATES—FIRST EVIDENCE OF RAILWAY DISCRIMINATIONS IN THE OIL\r\n    BUSINESS—REBATES FOUND TO BE GENERALLY GIVEN TO LARGE SHIPPERS—FIRST\r\n    PLAN FOR A SECRET COMBINATION—THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY—SECRET\r\n    CONTRACTS MADE WITH THE RAILROADS PROVIDING REBATES AND\r\n    DRAWBACKS—ROCKEFELLER AND ASSOCIATES FORCE CLEVELAND REFINERS TO\r\n    JOIN THE NEW COMBINATION OR SELL—RUMOUR OF THE PLAN REACHES THE OIL\r\n    REGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief refining competitor of Oil Creek in 1872 was Cleveland, Ohio.\r\nSince 1869 that city had done annually more refining than any other\r\nplace in the country. Strung along the banks of Walworth and Kingsbury\r\nRuns, the creeks to which the city frequently banishes her heavy and\r\nevil-smelling burdens, there had been since the early sixties from\r\ntwenty to thirty oil refineries. Why they were there, more than 200\r\nmiles from the spot where the oil was taken from the earth, a glance at\r\na map of the railroads of the time will show: By rail and water\r\nCleveland commanded the entire Western market. It had two trunk lines\r\nrunning to New York, both eager for oil traffic, and by Lake Erie and\r\nthe canal it had for a large part of the year a splendid cheap waterway.\r\nThus, at the opening of the oil business, Cleveland was destined by\r\ngeographical position to be a refining center.\r\n\r\nMen saw it, and hastened to take advantage of the opportunity. There was\r\ngrave risk. The oil supply might not hold out. As yet there was no\r\ncertain market for refined oil. But a sure result was not what drew\r\npeople into the oil business in the early sixties. Fortune was running\r\nfleet-footed across the country, and at her garment men clutched. They\r\nloved the chase almost as they did success, and so many a man in\r\nCleveland tried his luck in an oil refinery, as hundreds on Oil Creek\r\nwere trying it in an oil lease. By 1865 there were thirty refineries in\r\nthe town, with a capital of about a million and a half dollars and a\r\ndaily capacity of some 2,000 barrels. The works multiplied rapidly. The\r\nreport of the Cleveland Board of Trade for 1866 gives the number of\r\nplants at the end of that year as fifty, and it dilates eloquently on\r\nthe advantages of Cleveland as a refining point over even Pittsburg, to\r\nthat time supposed to be the natural centre for the business. If the\r\nrailroad and lake transportation men would but adopt as liberal a policy\r\ntoward the oil freights of Cleveland as the Pennsylvania Railroad was\r\nadopting toward that of Pittsburg, aided by her natural advantages the\r\ntown was bound to become the greatest oil refining centre in the United\r\nStates. By 1868 the Board of Trade reported joyfully that Cleveland was\r\nreceiving within 300,000 barrels as much oil as Pittsburg. In 1869 she\r\nsurpassed all competitors. “Cleveland now claims the leading position\r\namong the manufacturers of petroleum with a very reasonable prospect of\r\nholding that rank for some time to come,” commented the Board of Trade\r\nreport. “Each year has seen greater consolidation of capital, greater\r\nenergy and success in prosecuting the business, and, notwithstanding\r\nsome disastrous fires, a stronger determination to establish an\r\nimmovable reputation for the quantity and quality of this most important\r\nproduct. The total capital invested in this business is not less than\r\nfour millions of dollars and the total product of the year would not\r\nfall short of fifteen millions.”\r\n\r\nAmong the many young men of Cleveland who, from the start, had an eye on\r\nthe oil-refining business and had begun to take an active part in its\r\ndevelopment as soon as it was demonstrated that there was a reasonable\r\nhope of its being permanent, was a young firm of produce commission\r\nmerchants. Both members of this firm were keen business men, and one of\r\nthem had remarkable commercial vision—a genius for seeing the\r\npossibilities in material things. This man’s name was Rockefeller—John\r\nD. Rockefeller. He was but twenty-three years old when he first went\r\ninto the oil business, but he had already got his feet firmly on the\r\nbusiness ladder, and had got them there by his own efforts. The habit of\r\ndriving good bargains and of saving money had started him. He himself\r\nonce told how he learned these lessons so useful in money-making, in one\r\nof his frequent Sunday-school talks to young men on success in business.\r\nThe value of a good bargain he learned in buying cord-wood for his\r\nfather: “I knew what a cord of good solid beech and maple wood was. My\r\nfather told me to select only the solid wood and the straight wood and\r\nnot to put any limbs in it or any punky wood. That was a good training\r\nfor me. I did not need any father to tell me or anybody else how many\r\nfeet it took to make a cord of wood.”\r\n\r\nAnd here is how he learned the value of investing money:\r\n\r\n“Among the early experiences that were helpful to me that I recollect\r\nwith pleasure was one in working a few days for a neighbour in digging\r\npotatoes—a very enterprising, thrifty farmer, who could dig a great many\r\npotatoes. I was a boy of perhaps thirteen or fourteen years of age, and\r\nit kept me very busy from morning until night. It was a ten-hour day.\r\nAnd as I was saving these little sums I soon learned that I could get as\r\nmuch interest for fifty dollars loaned at seven per cent.—the legal rate\r\nin the state of New York at that time for a year—as I could earn by\r\ndigging potatoes for 100 days. The impression was gaining ground with me\r\nthat it was a good thing to let the money be my slave and not make\r\nmyself a slave to money.” Here we have the foundation principles of a\r\ngreat financial career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IN 1872\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen young Rockefeller was thirteen years old, his father moved from the\r\nfarm in Central New York, where the boy had been born (July 8, 1839), to\r\na farm near Cleveland, Ohio. He went to school in Cleveland for three\r\nyears. In 1855 it became necessary for him to earn his own living. It\r\nwas a hard year in the West and the boy walked the streets for days\r\nlooking for work. He was about to give it up and go to the country when,\r\nto quote the story as Mr. Rockefeller once told it to his Cleveland\r\nSunday-school, “As good fortune would have it I went down to the dock\r\nand made one more application, and I was told that if I would come in\r\nafter dinner—our noon-day meal was dinner in those days—they would see\r\nif I could come to work for them. I went down after dinner and I got the\r\nposition, and I was permitted to remain in the city.” The position, that\r\nof a clerk and bookkeeper, was not lucrative. According to a small\r\nledger which has figured frequently in Mr. Rockefeller’s religious\r\ninstructions, he earned from September 26, 1855, to January, 1856, fifty\r\ndollars. “Out of that,” Mr. Rockefeller told the young men of his\r\nSunday-school class, “I paid my washerwoman and the lady I boarded with,\r\nand I saved a little money to put away.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fragment of a page in the city directory of Cleveland, Ohio, for 1857.\r\n    This is the first year in which the name John D. Rockefeller appears\r\n    in the directory. The same entry is made in 1858. The next year,\r\n    1859, Mr. Rockefeller is entered as a member of the firm of Clark\r\n    and Rockefeller.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe proved an admirable accountant—one of the early-and-late sort, who\r\nsaw everything, forgot nothing and never talked. In 1856 his salary was\r\nraised to twenty-five dollars a month, and he went on always “saving a\r\nlittle money to put away.” In 1858 came a chance to invest his savings.\r\nAmong his acquaintances was a young Englishman, M. B. Clark. Older by\r\ntwelve years than Rockefeller he had left a hard life in England when he\r\nwas twenty to seek fortune in America. He had landed in Boston in 1847,\r\nwithout a penny or a friend, and it had taken three months for him to\r\nearn money to get to Ohio. Here he had taken the first job at hand, as\r\nman-of-all-work, wood-chopper, teamster. He had found his way to\r\nCleveland, had become a valuable man in the houses where he was\r\nemployed, had gone to school at nights, had saved money. They were two\r\nof a kind, Clark and Rockefeller, and in 1858 they pooled their earnings\r\nand started a produce commission business on the Cleveland docks. The\r\nventure succeeded. Local historians credit Clark and Rockefeller with\r\ndoing a business of $450,000 the first year. The war came on, and as\r\nneither partner went to the front, they had full chance to take\r\nadvantage of the opportunity for produce business a great army gives. A\r\ngreater chance than furnishing army supplies, lucrative as most people\r\nfound that, was in the oil business (so Clark and Rockefeller began to\r\nthink), and in 1862, when an Englishman of ability and energy, one\r\nSamuel Andrews, asked them to back him in starting a refinery, they put\r\nin $4,000 and promised to give more if necessary. Now Andrews was a\r\nmechanical genius. He devised new processes, made a better and better\r\nquality of oil, got larger and larger percentages of refined from his\r\ncrude. The little refinery grew big, and Clark and Rockefeller soon had\r\n$100,000 or more in it. In the meantime Cleveland was growing as a\r\nrefining centre. The business which in 1860 had been a gamble was by\r\n1865 one most promising industries of the town. It was but the\r\nbeginning—so Mr. Rockefeller thought—and in that year he sold out his\r\nshare of the commission business and put his money into the oil firm of\r\nRockefeller and Andrews.\r\n\r\nIn the new firm Andrews attended to the manufacturing. The pushing of\r\nthe business, the buying and the selling, fell to Rockefeller. From the\r\nstart his effect was tremendous. He had the frugal man’s hatred of waste\r\nand disorder, of middlemen and unnecessary manipulation, and he began a\r\nvigorous elimination of these from his business. The residuum that other\r\nrefineries let run into the ground, he sold. Old iron found its way to\r\nthe junk shop. He bought his oil directly from the wells. He made his\r\nown barrels. He watched and saved and contrived. The ability with which\r\nhe made the smallest bargain furnishes topics to Cleveland story-tellers\r\nto-day. Low-voiced, soft-footed, humble, knowing every point in every\r\nman’s business, he never tired until he got his wares at the lowest\r\npossible figure. “John always got the best of the bargain,” old men tell\r\nyou in Cleveland to-day, and they wince though they laugh in telling it.\r\n“Smooth,” “a _savy_ fellow,” is their description of him. To drive a\r\ngood bargain was the joy of his life. “The only time I ever saw John\r\nRockefeller enthusiastic,” a man told the writer once, “was when a\r\nreport came in from the creek that his buyer had secured a cargo of oil\r\nat a figure much below the market price. He bounded from his chair with\r\na shout of joy, danced up and down, hugged me, threw up his hat, acted\r\nso like a madman that I have never forgotten it.”\r\n\r\nHe could borrow as well as bargain. The firm’s capital was limited;\r\ngrowing as they were, they often needed money, and had none. Borrow they\r\nmust. Rarely if ever did Mr. Rockefeller fail. There is a story handed\r\ndown in Cleveland from the days of Clark and Rockefeller, produce\r\nmerchants, which is illustrative of his methods. One day a well-known\r\nand rich business man stepped into the office and asked for Mr.\r\nRockefeller. He was out, and Clark met the visitor. “Mr. Clark,” he\r\nsaid, “you may tell Mr. Rockefeller, when he comes in, that I think I\r\ncan use the $10,000 he wants to invest with me for your firm. I have\r\nthought it all over.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” cried Clark, “we don’t want to invest $10,000. John is out\r\nright now trying to borrow $5,000 for us.”\r\n\r\nIt turned out that to prepare him for a proposition to borrow $5,000 Mr.\r\nRockefeller had told the gentleman that he and Clark wanted to invest\r\n$10,000!\r\n\r\n“And the joke of it is,” said Clark, who used to tell the story, “John\r\ngot the $5,000 even after I had let the cat out of the bag. Oh, he was\r\nthe greatest borrower you ever saw!”\r\n\r\nThese qualities told. The firm grew as rapidly as the oil business of\r\nthe town, and started a second refinery—William A. Rockefeller and\r\nCompany. They took in a partner, H. M. Flagler, and opened a house in\r\nNew York for selling oil. Of all these concerns John D. Rockefeller was\r\nthe head. Finally, in June, 1870, five years after he became an active\r\npartner in the refining business, Mr. Rockefeller combined all his\r\ncompanies into one—the Standard Oil Company. The capital of the new\r\nconcern was $1,000,000. The parties interested in it were John D.\r\nRockefeller, Henry M. Flagler, Samuel Andrews, Stephen V. Harkness, and\r\nWilliam Rockefeller.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map of Northwestern Pennsylvania, showing the relation of the Oil\r\n    Regions to the railroads in 1859, when oil was “discovered.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe strides the firm of Rockefeller and Andrews made after the former\r\nwent into it were attributed for three or four years mainly to his\r\nextraordinary capacity for bargaining and borrowing. Then its chief\r\ncompetitors began to suspect something. John Rockefeller might get his\r\noil cheaper now and then, they said, but he could not do it often. He\r\nmight make close contracts for which they had neither the patience nor\r\nthe stomach. He might have an unusual mechanical and practical genius in\r\nhis partner. But these things could not explain all. They believed they\r\nbought, on the whole, almost as cheaply as he, and they knew they made\r\nas good oil and with as great, or nearly as great, economy. He could\r\nsell at no better price than they. Where was his advantage? There was\r\nbut one place where it could be, and that was in transportation. He must\r\nbe getting better rates from the railroads than they were. In 1868 or\r\n1869 a member of a rival firm long in the business, which had been\r\nprosperous from the start, and which prided itself on its methods, its\r\neconomy and its energy, Alexander, Scofield and Company, went to the\r\nAtlantic and Great Western road, then under the Erie management, and\r\ncomplained. “You are giving others better rates than you are us,” said\r\nMr. Alexander, the representative of the firm. “We cannot compete if you\r\ndo that.” The railroad agent did not attempt to deny it—he simply agreed\r\nto give Mr. Alexander a rebate also. The arrangement was interesting.\r\nMr. Alexander was to pay the open, or regular, rate on oil from the Oil\r\nRegions to Cleveland, which was then forty cents a barrel. At the end of\r\neach month he was to send to the railroad vouchers for the amount of oil\r\nshipped and paid for at forty cents, and was to get back from the\r\nrailroad, in money, fifteen cents on each barrel. This concession\r\napplied only to oil brought from the wells. He was never able to get a\r\nrebate on oil shipped eastward.[6] According to Mr. Alexander, the\r\nAtlantic and Great Western gave the rebates on oil from the Oil Regions\r\nto Cleveland up to 1871 and the system was then discontinued. Late in\r\n1871, however, the firm for the first time got a rebate on the Lake\r\nShore road on oil brought from the field.\r\n\r\nAnother Cleveland man, W. H. Doane, engaged in shipping crude oil, began\r\nto suspect about the same time as Mr. Alexander that the Standard was\r\nreceiving rebates. Now Mr. Doane had always been opposed to the\r\n“drawback business,” but it was impossible for him to supply his\r\ncustomers with crude oil at as low a rate as the Standard paid if it\r\nreceived a rebate and he did not, and when it was first generally\r\nrumoured in Cleveland that the railroads were favouring Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhe went to see the agent of the road. “I told him I did not want any\r\ndrawback, unless others were getting it; I wanted it if they were\r\ngetting it, and he gave me at that time ten cents drawback.” This\r\narrangement Mr. Doane said had lasted but a short time. At the date he\r\nwas speaking—the spring of 1872—he had had no drawback for two years.\r\n\r\nA still more important bit of testimony as to the time when rebates\r\nfirst began to be given to the Cleveland refiners and as to who first\r\ngot them and why, is contained in an affidavit made in 1880 by the very\r\nman who made the discrimination.[7] This man was General J. H. Devereux,\r\nwho in 1868 succeeded Amasa Stone as vice-president of the Lake Shore\r\nRailroad. General Devereux said that his experience with the oil traffic\r\nhad begun with his connection with the Lake Shore; that the only written\r\nmemoranda concerning oil which he found in his office on entering his\r\nnew position was a book in which it was stated that the representatives\r\nof the twenty-five oil-refining firms in Cleveland had agreed to pay a\r\ncent a gallon on crude oil removed from the Oil Regions. General\r\nDevereux says that he soon found there was a deal of trouble in store\r\nfor him over oil freight. The competition between the twenty-five firms\r\nwas close, the Pennsylvania was “claiming a patent right” on the\r\ntransportation of oil and was putting forth every effort to make\r\nPittsburg and Philadelphia the chief refining centres. Oil Creek was\r\nboasting that it was going to be the future refining point for the\r\nworld. All of this looked bad for what General Devereux speaks of as the\r\n“then very limited refining capacity of Cleveland.” This remark shows\r\nhow new he was to the business, for, as we have already seen, Cleveland\r\nin 1868 had anything but a limited refining capacity. Between three and\r\nfour million dollars were invested in oil refineries, and the town was\r\nreceiving within 35,000 barrels of as much oil as New York City, and\r\nwithin 300,000 as much as Pittsburg, and it was boasting that the next\r\nyear it would outstrip these competitors, which, as a matter of fact, it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThe natural point for General Devereux to consider, of course, was\r\nwhether he could meet the rates the Pennsylvania were giving and\r\nincrease the oil freight for the Lake Shore. The road had a branch\r\nrunning to Franklin, Pennsylvania, within a few miles of Oil City. This\r\nhe completed, and then, as he says in his affidavit, “a sharper contest\r\nthan ever was produced growing out of the opposition of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad in competition. Such rates and arrangements were made by the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad that it was publicly proclaimed in the public\r\nprint in Oil City, Titusville and other places that Cleveland was to be\r\nwiped out as a refining centre as with a sponge.” General Devereux goes\r\non to say that all the refiners of the town, without exception, came to\r\nhim in alarm, and expressed their fears that they would have either to\r\nabandon their business there or move to Titusville or other points in\r\nthe Oil Regions; that the only exception to this decision was that\r\noffered by Rockefeller, Andrews and Flagler, who, on his assurance that\r\nthe Lake Shore Railroad could and would handle oil as cheaply as the\r\nPennsylvania Company, proposed to stand their ground at Cleveland and\r\nfight it out on that line. And so General Devereux gave the Standard the\r\nrebate on the rate which Amasa Stone had made with all the refiners. Why\r\nhe should not have quieted the fears of the twenty-four or twenty-five\r\nother refiners by lowering their rate, too, does not appear in the\r\naffidavit. At all events the rebate had come, and, as we have seen, it\r\nsoon was suspected and others went after it, and in some cases got it.\r\nBut the rebate seems to have been granted generally only on oil brought\r\nfrom the Oil Regions. Mr. Alexander claims he was never able to get his\r\nrate lowered on his Eastern shipments. The railroad took the position\r\nwith him that if he could ship as much oil as the Standard he could have\r\nas low a rate, but not otherwise. Now in 1870 the Standard Oil Company\r\nhad a daily capacity of about 1,500 barrels of crude. The refinery was\r\nthe largest in the town, though it had some close competitors.\r\nNevertheless on the strength of its large capacity it received the\r\nspecial favour. It was a plausible way to get around the theory\r\ngenerally held then, as now, though not so definitely crystallised into\r\nlaw, that the railroad being a common carrier had no right to\r\ndiscriminate between its patrons. It remained to be seen whether the\r\npractice would be accepted by Mr. Rockefeller’s competitors without a\r\ncontest, or, if contested, would be supported by the law.\r\n\r\nWhat the Standard’s rebate on Eastern shipments was in 1870 it is\r\nimpossible to say. Mr. Alexander says he was never able to get a rate\r\nlower than $1.33 a barrel by rail, and that it was commonly believed in\r\nCleveland that the Standard had a rate of ninety cents. Mr. Flagler,\r\nhowever, the only member of the firm who has been examined under oath on\r\nthat point, showed, by presenting the contract of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany with the Lake Shore road in 1870, that the rates varied during\r\nthe year from $1.40 to $1.20 and $1.60, according to the season. When\r\nMr. Flagler was asked if there was no drawback or rebate on this rate he\r\nanswered, “None whatever.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the above as if the one man in the Cleveland oil\r\ntrade in 1870 who ought to have been satisfied was Mr. Rockefeller. His\r\nwas the largest firm in the largest refining centre of the country; that\r\nis, of the 10,000 to 12,000 daily capacity divided among the twenty-five\r\nor twenty-six refiners of Cleveland he controlled 1,500 barrels. Not\r\nonly was Cleveland the largest refining centre in the country, it was\r\ngaining rapidly, for where in 1868 it shipped 776,356 barrels of refined\r\noil, in 1869 it shipped 923,933, in 1870 1,459,500, and in 1871\r\n1,640,499.[8] Not only did Mr. Rockefeller control the largest firm in\r\nthis most prosperous centre of a prosperous business, he controlled one\r\nof amazing efficiency. The combination, in 1870, of the various\r\ncompanies with which he was connected had brought together a group of\r\nremarkable men. Samuel Andrews, by all accounts, was the ablest\r\nmechanical superintendent in Cleveland. William Rockefeller, the brother\r\nof John D. Rockefeller, was not only an energetic and intelligent\r\nbusiness man, he was a man whom people liked. He was open-hearted,\r\njolly, a good story-teller, a man who knew and liked a good horse—not\r\ntoo pious, as some of John’s business associates thought him, not a man\r\nto suspect or fear, as many a man did John. Old oil men will tell you on\r\nthe creek to-day how much they liked him in the days when he used to\r\ncome to Oil City buying oil for the Cleveland firm. The personal quality\r\nof William Rockefeller was, and always has been, a strong asset of the\r\nStandard Oil Company. Probably the strongest man in the firm after John\r\nD. Rockefeller was Henry M. Flagler. He was, like the others, a young\r\nman, and one who, like the head of the firm, had the passion for money,\r\nand in a hard self-supporting experience, begun when but a boy, had\r\nlearned, as well as his chief, some of the principles of making it. He\r\nwas untiring in his efforts to increase the business, quick to see an\r\nadvantage, as quick to take it. He had no scruples to make him hesitate\r\nover the ethical quality of a contract which was advantageous. Success,\r\nthat is, making money, was its own justification. He was not a secretive\r\nman, like John D. Rockefeller, not a dreamer, but he could keep his\r\nmouth shut when necessary and he knew the worth of a financial dream\r\nwhen it was laid before him. It must have been evident to every business\r\nman who came in contact with the young Standard Oil Company that it\r\nwould go far. The firm itself must have known it would go far. Indeed\r\nnothing could have stopped the Standard Oil Company in 1870—the oil\r\nbusiness being what it was—but an entire change in the nature of the\r\nmembers of the firm, and they were not the kind of material which\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nWith such a set of associates, with his organisation complete from his\r\nbuyers on the creek to his exporting agent in New York, with the\r\ntransportation advantages which none of his competitors had had the\r\ndaring or the persuasive power to get, certainly Mr. Rockefeller should\r\nhave been satisfied in 1870. But Mr. Rockefeller was far from satisfied.\r\nHe was a brooding, cautious, secretive man, seeing all the possible\r\ndangers as well as all the possible opportunities in things, and he\r\nstudied, as a player at chess, all the possible combinations which might\r\nimperil his supremacy. These twenty-five Cleveland rivals of his—how\r\ncould he at once and forever put them out of the game? He and his\r\npartners had somehow conceived a great idea—the advantages of\r\ncombination. What might they not do if they could buy out and absorb the\r\nbig refineries now competing with them in Cleveland? The possibilities\r\nof the idea grew as they discussed it. Finally they began tentatively to\r\nsound some of their rivals. But there were other rivals than these at\r\nhome. There were the creek refiners! They were there at the mouth of the\r\nwells. What might not this geographical advantage do in time? Refining\r\nwas going on there on an increasing scale; the capacity of the Oil\r\nRegions had indeed risen to nearly 10,000 barrels a day—equal to that of\r\nNew York, exceeding that of Pittsburg by nearly 4,000 barrels, and\r\nalmost equalling that of Cleveland. The men of the oil country loudly\r\ndeclared that they meant to refine for the world. They boasted of an oil\r\nkingdom which eventually should handle the entire business and compel\r\nCleveland and Pittsburg either to abandon their works or bring them to\r\nthe oil country. In this boastful ambition they were encouraged\r\nparticularly by the Pennsylvania Railroad, which naturally handled the\r\nlargest percentage of the oil. How long could the Standard Oil Company\r\nstand against this competition?\r\n\r\nThere was another interest as deeply concerned as Mr. Rockefeller in\r\npreserving Cleveland’s supremacy as a refining centre, and this was the\r\nLake Shore and New York Central Railroads. Let the bulk of refining be\r\ndone in the Oil Regions and these roads were in danger of losing a\r\nprofitable branch of business. This situation in regard to the oil\r\ntraffic was really more serious now than in 1868 when General Devereux\r\nhad first given the Standard a rebate. Then it was that the\r\nPennsylvania, through its lusty ally the Empire Transportation Company,\r\nwas making the chief fight to secure a “patent right on oil\r\ntransportation.” The Erie was now becoming as aggressive a competitor.\r\nGould and Fisk had gone into the fight with the vigour and the utter\r\nunscrupulousness which characterised all their dealings. They were\r\nallying themselves with the Pennsylvania Transportation Company, the\r\nonly large rival pipe-line system which the Empire had. They were\r\nputting up a refinery near Jersey City, and they were taking advantage\r\nshrewdly of all the speculative features of the new business.\r\n\r\nAs competition grew between the roads, they grew more reckless in\r\ngranting rebates, the refiners more insistent in demanding them. By 1871\r\nthings had come to such a pass in the business that every refiner\r\nsuspected his neighbour to be getting better rates than he. The result\r\nwas that the freight agents were constantly beset for rebates, and that\r\nthe large shippers were generally getting them on the ground of the\r\nquantity of oil they controlled. Indeed it was evident that the rebate\r\nbeing admitted, the only way in which it could be adjusted with a show\r\nof fairness was to grade it according to the size of the shipment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  W.

Rockefeller in the oil business since 1867.\r\n    Officer of the Standard Oil Company since its organization in 1870.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions of competition it was certain that the New York\r\nCentral system must work if it was to keep its great oil freight, and\r\nthe general freight agent of the Lake Shore road began to give the\r\nquestion special attention. This man was Peter H. Watson. Mr. Watson was\r\nan able patent lawyer who served under the strenuous Stanton as an\r\nAssistant-Secretary of War, and served well. After the war he had been\r\nmade general freight agent of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern\r\nRailroad, and later president of the branch of that road which ran into\r\nthe Oil Regions. He had oil interests principally at Franklin,\r\nPennsylvania, and was well known to all oil men. He was a business\r\nintimate of Mr. Rockefeller and a warm friend of Horace F. Clark, the\r\nson-in-law of W. H. Vanderbilt, at that time president of the Lake Shore\r\nand Michigan Southern Railroad. As the Standard Oil Company was the\r\nlargest shipper in Cleveland and had already received the special favour\r\nfrom the Lake Shore which General Devereux describes, it was natural\r\nthat Mr. Watson should consult frequently with Mr. Rockefeller on the\r\nquestion of holding and increasing his oil freight. It was equally\r\nnatural, too, that Mr. Rockefeller should use his influence with Mr.\r\nWatson to strengthen the theory so important to his rapid growth—the\r\ntheory that the biggest shipper should have the best rate.\r\n\r\nTwo other towns shared Cleveland’s fear of the rise of the Oil Regions\r\nas a refining centre, and they were Pittsburg and Philadelphia, and Mr.\r\nRockefeller and Mr. Watson found in certain refiners of these places a\r\nstrong sympathy with any plan which looked to holding the region in\r\ncheck. But while the menace in their geographical positions was the\r\nfirst ground of sympathy between these gentlemen, something more than\r\nlocal troubles occupied them. This was the condition of the refining\r\nbusiness as a whole. It was unsatisfactory in many particulars. First,\r\nit was overdone. The great profits on refined oil and the growing demand\r\nfor it had naturally caused a great number to rush into its manufacture.\r\nThere was at this time a refining capacity of three barrels to every one\r\nproduced. To be sure, few if any of these plants expected to run the\r\nyear around. Then, as to-day, there were nearly always some stills in\r\neven the most prosperous works shut down. But after making a fair\r\nallowance for this fact there was still a much larger amount of refining\r\nactually done than the market demanded. The result was that the price of\r\nrefined oil was steadily falling. Where Mr. Rockefeller had received on\r\nan average 58¾ cents a gallon for the oil he exported in 1865, the year\r\nhe went into business, in 1870 he received but 26⅜ cents. In 1865 he had\r\na margin of forty-three cents, out of which to pay for transportation,\r\nmanufacturing, barrelling and marketing and to make his profits. In 1870\r\nhe had but 17⅛ cents with which to do all this. To be sure his expenses\r\nhad fallen enormously between 1865 and 1870, but so had his profits. The\r\nmultiplication of refiners with the intense competition threatened to\r\ncut them down still lower. Naturally Mr. Rockefeller and his friends\r\nlooked with dismay on this lowering of profits through gaining\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nAnother anxiety of the American refiners was the condition of the export\r\ntrade. Oil had risen to fourth place in the exports of the United States\r\nin the twelve years since its discovery, and every year larger\r\nquantities were consumed abroad, but it was crude oil, not refined,\r\nwhich the foreigners were beginning to demand; that is, they had found\r\nthey could import crude, refine it at home, and sell it cheaper than\r\nthey could buy American refined. France, to encourage her home\r\nrefineries, had even put a tax on American refined.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1871, while Mr. Rockefeller and his friends were occupied\r\nwith all these questions, certain Pennsylvania refiners, it is not too\r\ncertain who, brought to them a remarkable scheme, the gist of which was\r\nto bring together secretly a large enough body of refiners and shippers\r\nto persuade all the railroads handling oil to give to the company formed\r\nspecial rebates on its oil, and drawbacks on that of other people. If\r\nthey could get such rates it was evident that those outside of their\r\ncombination could not compete with them long and that they would become\r\neventually the only refiners. They could then limit their output to\r\nactual demand, and so keep up prices. This done, they could easily\r\npersuade the railroads to transport no crude for exportation, so that\r\nthe foreigners would be forced to buy American refined. They believed\r\nthat the price of oil thus exported could easily be advanced fifty per\r\ncent. The control of the refining interests would also enable them to\r\nfix their own price on crude. As they would be the only buyers and\r\nsellers, the speculative character of the business would be done away\r\nwith. In short, the scheme they worked out put the entire oil business\r\nin their hands. It looked as simple to put into operation as it was\r\ndazzling in its results. Mr. Flagler has sworn that neither he nor Mr.\r\nRockefeller believed in this scheme.[9] But when they found that their\r\nfriend Peter H. Watson, and various Philadelphia and Pittsburg parties\r\nwho felt as they did about the oil business, believed in it, they went\r\nin and began at once to work up a company—secretly. It was evident that\r\na scheme which aimed at concentrating in the hands of one company the\r\nbusiness now operated by scores, and which proposed to effect this\r\nconsolidation through a practice of the railroads which was contrary to\r\nthe spirit of their charters, although freely indulged in, must be\r\nworked with fine discretion if it ever were to be effective.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to get a charter—quietly. At a meeting held in\r\nPhiladelphia late in the fall of 1871 a friend of one of the gentlemen\r\ninterested mentioned to him that a certain estate then in liquidation\r\nhad a charter for sale which gave its owners the right to carry on any\r\nkind of business in any country and in any way; that it could be bought\r\nfor what it would cost to get a charter under the general laws of the\r\nstate, and that it would be a favour to the heirs to buy it. The\r\nopportunity was promptly taken. The name of the charter bought was the\r\n“South (often written Southern) Improvement Company.” For a beginning it\r\nwas as good a name as another, since it said nothing.\r\n\r\nWith this charter in hand Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Watson and their\r\nassociates began to seek converts. In order that their great scheme\r\nmight not be injured by premature public discussion they asked of each\r\nperson whom they approached a pledge of secrecy. Two forms of the\r\npledges required before anything was revealed were published later. The\r\nfirst of these, which appeared in the New York Tribune, read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I, A. B., do faithfully promise upon my honour and faith as a\r\n  gentleman that I will keep secret all transactions which I may have\r\n  with the corporation known as the South Improvement Company; that,\r\n  should I fail to complete any bargains with the said company, all\r\n  the preliminary conversations shall be kept strictly private; and,\r\n  finally, that I will not disclose the price for which I dispose of\r\n  my product, or any other facts which may in any way bring to light\r\n  the internal workings or organisation of the company. All this I do\r\n  freely promise.\r\n\r\n                                  Signed..............................\r\n\r\n  Witnessed by..............................\r\n\r\n\r\nA second, published in a history of the “Southern Improvement Company,”\r\nran:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The undersigned pledge their solemn words of honour that they will\r\n  not communicate to any one without permission of Z (name of director\r\n  of Southern Improvement Company) any information that he may convey\r\n  to them, or any of them, in relation to the Southern Improvement\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  Witness..............................\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the promoters met with encouragement is evident from the fact that,\r\nwhen the corporators came together on January 2, 1872, in Philadelphia,\r\nfor the first time under their charter, and transferred the company to\r\nthe stockholders, they claimed to represent in one way or another a\r\nlarge part of the refining interest of the country. At this meeting\r\n1,100 shares of the stock of the company, which was divided into 2,000\r\n$100 shares, were subscribed for, and twenty per cent. of their value\r\nwas paid in. Just who took stock at this meeting the writer has not been\r\nable to discover. At the same time a discussion came up as to what\r\nrefiners were to be allowed to go into the new company. Each of the men\r\nrepresented had friends whom he wanted taken care of, and after\r\nconsiderable discussion it was decided to take in every refinery they\r\ncould get hold of. This decision was largely due to the railroad men.\r\nMr. Watson had seen them as soon as the plans for the company were\r\nformed, and they had all agreed that if they gave the rebates and\r\ndrawbacks all refineries then existing must be taken in upon the same\r\nlevel. That is, while the incorporators had intended to kill off all but\r\nthemselves and their friends, the railroads refused to go into a scheme\r\nwhich was going to put anybody out of business—the plan if they went\r\ninto it must cover the refining trade as it stood. It was enough that it\r\ncould prevent any one in the future going into the business.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this meeting of January 2 the rest of the stock of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company was taken. The complete list of stockholders,\r\nwith their holdings, was as follows:\r\n\r\n            William Frew, Philadelphia            10 shares\r\n            W. P. Logan, Philadelphia             10   〃\r\n            John P. Logan, Philadelphia           10   〃\r\n            Charles Lockhart, Pittsburg           10   〃\r\n            Richard S.

G. Warden of Philadelphia\r\nsecretary of the new association. It will be noticed that the largest\r\nindividual holdings in the company were those of W. G. Warden and O. F.\r\nWaring, each of whom had 475 shares. The company most heavily interested\r\nin the South Improvement Company was the Standard Oil of Cleveland, J.\r\nD. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller and H. M. Flagler, all stockholders\r\nof that company, each having 180 shares—540 in the company. O. H. Payne\r\nand J. A. Bostwick, who soon after became stockholders in the Standard\r\nOil Company, also had each 180 shares, giving Mr. Rockefeller and his\r\nassociates 900 shares in all.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been stated that the South Improvement Company\r\nrepresented the bulk of the oil-refining interests in the country. The\r\nincorporators of the company in approaching the railroads assured them\r\nthat this was so. As a matter of fact, however, the thirteen gentlemen\r\nabove named, who were the only ones ever holding stock in the concern,\r\ndid not control over one-tenth of the refining business of the United\r\nStates in 1872. That business in the aggregate amounted to a daily\r\ncapacity of about 45,000 barrels—from 45,000 to 50,000, Mr. Warden put\r\nit—and the stockholders of the South Improvement Company owned a\r\ncombined capacity of not over 4,600 barrels. In assuring the railroads\r\nthat they controlled the business, they were dealing with their hopes\r\nrather than with facts.\r\n\r\nThe organisation complete, there remained contracts to be made with the\r\nrailroads. Three systems were to be interested: The Central, which, by\r\nits connection with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern, ran directly\r\ninto the Oil Regions; the Erie, allied with the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern, with a short line likewise tapping the heart of the region; and\r\nthe Pennsylvania, with the connections known as the Allegheny Valley and\r\nOil Creek Railroad. The persons to be won over were: W. H. Vanderbilt,\r\nof the Central; H. F. Clark, president of the Lake Shore and Michigan\r\nSouthern; Jay Gould, of the Erie; General G. B. McClellan, president of\r\nthe Atlantic and Great Western; and Tom Scott, of the Pennsylvania.\r\nThere seems to have been little difficulty in persuading any of these\r\npersons to go into the scheme after they had been assured by the leaders\r\nthat all of the refiners were to be taken in. This was a verbal\r\ncondition, however, not found in the contracts they signed. This\r\nimportant fact Mr. Warden himself made clear when three months later he\r\nwas on the witness stand before a committee of Congress appointed to\r\nlook into the great scheme. “We had considerable discussion with the\r\nrailroads,” Mr. Warden said, “in regard to the matter of rebate on their\r\ncharges for freight; they did not want to give us a rebate unless it was\r\nwith the understanding that all the refineries should be brought into\r\nthe arrangement and placed upon the same level.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You say you made propositions to railroad companies, which they\r\n  agreed to accept upon the condition that you could include all the\r\n  refineries?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; I did not say that; I said that was the understanding\r\n  when we discussed this matter with them; it was no proposition on\r\n  our part; they discussed it, not in the form of a proposition that\r\n  the refineries should be all taken in, but it was the intention and\r\n  resolution of the company from the first that that should be the\r\n  result; we never had any other purpose in the matter.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In case you could take the refineries all in, the railroads\r\n  proposed to give you a rebate upon their freight charges?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; it was not put in that form; we were to put the\r\n  refineries all in upon the same terms; it was the understanding with\r\n  the railroad companies that we were to have a rebate; there was no\r\n  rebate given in consideration of our putting the companies all in,\r\n  but we told them we would do it; the contract with the railroad\r\n  companies was with us.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But if you did form a company composed of the proprietors of\r\n  all these refineries, you were to have a rebate upon your freight\r\n  charges?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No; we were to have a rebate anyhow, but were to give all the\r\n  refineries the privilege of coming in.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You were to have the rebate whether they came in or not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n  “What effect were these arrangements to have upon those who did not\r\n  come into the combination...?” asked the chairman.\r\n\r\n  “I do not think we ever took that question up,” answered Mr. Warden.\r\n\r\n\r\nA second objection to making a contract with the company came from Mr.\r\nScott of the Pennsylvania road and Mr. Potts of the Empire\r\nTransportation Company. The substance of this objection was that the\r\nplan took no account of the oil producer—the man to whom the world owed\r\nthe business. Mr. Scott was strong in his assertion that they could\r\nnever succeed unless they took care of the producers. Mr. Warden\r\nobjected strongly to forming a combination with them. “The interests of\r\nthe producers were in one sense antagonistic to ours: one as the seller\r\nand the other as the buyer. We held in argument that the producers were\r\nabundantly able to take care of their own branch of the business if they\r\ntook care of the quantity produced.” So strongly did Mr. Scott argue,\r\nhowever, that finally the members of the South Improvement Company\r\nyielded, and a draft of an agreement, to be proposed to the producers,\r\nwas drawn up in lead pencil; it was never presented. It seems to have\r\nbeen used principally to quiet Mr. Scott.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THOMAS A.

VANDERBILT\r\n\r\n  The contract of the South Improvement Company with the New York\r\n    Central was signed by Mr. Vanderbilt, then vice-president of the\r\n    road.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COMMODORE CORNELIUS VANDERBILT\r\n\r\n  President of the New York Central Railroad when the contract with the\r\n    South Improvement Company was signed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe work of persuasion went on swiftly. By the 18th of January the\r\npresident of the Pennsylvania road, J. Edgar Thompson, had put his\r\nsignature to the contract, and soon after Mr. Vanderbilt and Mr. Clark\r\nsigned for the Central system, and Jay Gould and General McClellan for\r\nthe Erie. The contracts to which these gentlemen put their names fixed\r\ngross rates of freight from all _common points_, as the leading shipping\r\npoints within the Oil Regions were called, to all the great refining and\r\nshipping centres—New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburg and\r\nCleveland. For example, the open rate on crude to New York was put at\r\n$2.56. On this price the South Improvement Company was allowed a rebate\r\nof $1.06 for its shipments; but it got not only this rebate, it was\r\ngiven in cash a like amount on each barrel of crude shipped by parties\r\noutside the combination.\r\n\r\nThe open rate from Cleveland to New York was two dollars, and fifty\r\ncents of this was turned over to the South Improvement Company, which at\r\nthe same time received a rebate enabling it to ship for $1.50. Again, an\r\nindependent refiner in Cleveland paid eighty cents a barrel to get his\r\ncrude from the Oil Regions to his works, and the railroad sent forty\r\ncents of this money to the South Improvement Company. At the same time\r\nit cost the Cleveland refiner in the combination but forty cents to get\r\nhis crude oil. Like drawbacks and rebates were given for all\r\npoints—Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Boston and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nAn interesting provision in the contracts was that full way-bills of all\r\npetroleum shipped over the roads should each day be sent to the South\r\nImprovement Company. This, of course, gave them knowledge of just who\r\nwas doing business outside of their company—of how much business he was\r\ndoing, and with whom he was doing it. Not only were they to have full\r\nknowledge of the business of all shippers—they were to have access to\r\nall books of the railroads.\r\n\r\nThe parties to the contracts agreed that if anybody appeared in the\r\nbusiness offering an equal amount of transportation, and having equal\r\nfacilities for doing business with the South Improvement Company, the\r\nrailroads might give them equal advantages in drawbacks and rebates, but\r\nto make such a miscarriage of the scheme doubly improbable each railroad\r\nwas bound to co-operate as “far as it legally might to maintain the\r\nbusiness of the South Improvement Company against injury by competition,\r\nand lower or raise the gross rates of transportation for such times and\r\nto such extent as might be necessary to overcome the competition. The\r\nrebates and drawbacks to be varied _pari passu_ with the gross\r\nrates.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe reason given by the railroads in the contract for granting these\r\nextraordinary privileges was that the “magnitude and extent of the\r\nbusiness and operations” purposed to be carried on by the South\r\nImprovement Company would greatly promote the interest of the railroads\r\nand make it desirable for them to encourage their undertaking. The\r\nevident advantages received by the railroad were a regular amount of\r\nfreight,—the Pennsylvania was to have forty-five per cent. of the\r\nEast-bound shipments, the Erie and Central each 27½ per cent., while\r\nWest-bound freight was to be divided equally between them—fixed rates,\r\nand freedom from the system of cutting which they had all found so\r\nharassing and disastrous. That is, the South Improvement Company, which\r\nwas to include the entire refining capacity of the company, was to act\r\nas the evener of the oil business.[12]\r\n\r\nIt was on the second of January, 1872, that the organisation of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company was completed. The day before the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Cleveland increased its capital from $1,000,000 to\r\n$2,500,000, “all the stockholders of the company being present and\r\nvoting therefor.”[13] These stockholders were greater by five than in\r\n1870, the names of O. B. Jennings, Benjamin Brewster, Truman P. Handy,\r\nAmasa Stone, and Stillman Witt having been added. The last three were\r\nofficers and stockholders in one or more of the railroads centring in\r\nCleveland. Three weeks after this increase of capital Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhad the charter and contracts of the South Improvement Company in hand,\r\nand was ready to see what they would do in helping him carry out his\r\nidea of wholesale combination in Cleveland. There were at that time some\r\ntwenty-six refineries in the town—some of them very large plants. All of\r\nthem were feeling more or less the discouraging effects of the last\r\nthree or four years of railroad discriminations in favour of the\r\nStandard Oil Company. To the owners of these refineries Mr. Rockefeller\r\nnow went one by one, and explained the South Improvement Company. “You\r\nsee,” he told them, “this scheme is bound to work. It means an absolute\r\ncontrol by us of the oil business. There is no chance for anyone\r\noutside. But we are going to give everybody a chance to come in. You are\r\nto turn over your refinery to my appraisers, and I will give you\r\nStandard Oil Company stock or cash, as you prefer, for the value we put\r\nupon it. I advise you to take the stock. It will be for your good.”\r\nCertain refiners objected. They did not want to sell. They did want to\r\nkeep and manage their business. Mr. Rockefeller was regretful, but firm.\r\nIt was useless to resist, he told the hesitating; they would certainly\r\nbe crushed if they did not accept his offer, and he pointed out in\r\ndetail, and with gentleness, how beneficent the scheme really\r\nwas—preventing the creek refiners from destroying Cleveland, ending\r\ncompetition, keeping up the price of refined oil, and eliminating\r\nspeculation. Really a wonderful contrivance for the good of the oil\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThat such was Mr. Rockefeller’s argument is proved by abundant testimony\r\nfrom different individuals who succumbed to the pressure. Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s own brother, Frank Rockefeller, gave most definite\r\nevidence on this point in 1876 when he and others were trying to\r\ninterest Congress in a law regulating interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n“We had in Cleveland at one time about thirty establishments, but the\r\nSouth Improvement Company was formed, and the Cleveland companies were\r\ntold that if they didn’t sell their property to them it would be\r\nvalueless, that there was a combination of railroad and oil men, that\r\nthey would buy all they could, and that all they didn’t buy would be\r\ntotally valueless, because they would be unable to compete with the\r\nSouth Improvement Company, and the result was that out of thirty there\r\nwere only four or five that didn’t sell.”\r\n\r\n“From whom was that information received?” asked the examiner.\r\n\r\n“From the officers of the Standard Oil Company. They made no bones about\r\nit at all. They said: ‘If you don’t sell your property to us it will be\r\nvalueless, because we have got advantages with the railroads.’”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard those gentlemen say what you have stated?” Frank\r\nRockefeller was asked.\r\n\r\n“I have heard Rockefeller and Flagler say so,” he answered.\r\n\r\nW. H. Doane, whose evidence on the first rebates granted to the\r\nCleveland trade we have already quoted, told the Congressional committee\r\nwhich a few months after Mr. Rockefeller’s great coup tried to find out\r\nwhat had happened in Cleveland: “The refineries are all bought up by the\r\nStandard Oil works; they were forced to sell; the railroads had put up\r\nthe rates and it scared them. Men came to me and told me they could not\r\ncontinue their business; they became frightened and disposed of their\r\nproperty.” Mr. Doane’s own business, that of a crude oil shipper, was\r\nentirely ruined, all of his customers but one having sold.\r\n\r\nTo this same committee Mr. Alexander, of Alexander, Scofield and\r\nCompany, gave his reason for selling:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There was a pressure brought to bear upon my mind, and upon almost\r\n  all citizens of Cleveland engaged in the oil business, to the effect\r\n  that unless we went into the South Improvement Company we were\r\n  virtually killed as refiners; that if we did not sell out we should\r\n  be crushed out. My partner, Mr. Hewitt, had some negotiations with\r\n  parties connected with the South Improvement Company, and they gave\r\n  us to understand, at least my partner so represented to me, that we\r\n  should be crushed out if we did not go into that arrangement. He\r\n  wanted me to see the parties myself; but I said to him that I would\r\n  not have any dealings with certain parties who were in that company\r\n  for any purpose, and I never did. We sold at a sacrifice, and we\r\n  were obliged to. There was only one buyer in the market, and we had\r\n  to sell on their terms or be crushed out, as it was represented to\r\n  us. It was stated that they had a contract with railroads by which\r\n  they could run us into the ground if they pleased. After learning\r\n  what the arrangements were I felt as if, rather than fight such a\r\n  monopoly, I would withdraw from the business, even at a sacrifice. I\r\n  think we received about forty or forty-five cents on the dollar on\r\n  the valuation which we placed upon our refinery. We had spent over\r\n  $50,000 on our works during the past year, which was nearly all that\r\n  we received. We had paid out $60,000 or $70,000 before that; we\r\n  considered our works at their cash value worth seventy-five per\r\n  cent. of their cost. According to our valuation our establishment\r\n  was worth $150,000, and we sold it for about $65,000, which was\r\n  about forty or forty-five per cent. of its value. We sold to one of\r\n  the members, as I suppose, of the South Improvement Company, Mr.\r\n  Rockefeller; he is a director in that company; it was sold in name\r\n  to the Standard Oil Company, of Cleveland, but the arrangements\r\n  were, as I understand it, that they were to put it into the South\r\n  Improvement Company. I am stating what my partner told me; he did\r\n  all the business; his statement was that all these works were to be\r\n  merged into the South Improvement Company. I never talked with any\r\n  members of the South Improvement Company myself on the subject; I\r\n  declined to have anything to do with them.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hewitt, the partner who Mr. Alexander says carried on the\r\nnegotiations for the sale of the business, appeared before an\r\ninvestigating committee of the New York State Senate in 1879 and gave\r\nhis recollections of what happened. According to his story the entire\r\noil trade in Cleveland became paralysed when it became known that the\r\nSouth Improvement Company had “grappled the entire transportation of oil\r\nfrom the West to the seaboard.” Mr. Hewitt went to see the freight\r\nagents of the various roads; he called on W. H. Vanderbilt, but from no\r\none did he get any encouragement. Then he saw Peter H. Watson of the\r\nLake Shore Railroad, the president of the company which was frightening\r\nthe trade. “Watson was non-committal,” said Mr. Hewitt. “I got no\r\nsatisfaction except, ‘You better sell—you better get clear—better sell\r\nout—no help for it.’” After a little time Mr. Hewitt concluded with his\r\npartners that there was indeed “no help for it,” and he went to see Mr.\r\nRockefeller, who offered him fifty cents on the dollar on the\r\nconstructive account. The offer was accepted. There was nothing else to\r\ndo, the firm seems to have concluded. When they came to transfer the\r\nproperty Mr. Rockefeller urged Mr. Hewitt to take stock in the new\r\nconcern. “He told me,” said Mr. Hewitt, “that it would be sufficient to\r\ntake care of my family for all time, what I represented there, and\r\nasking for a reason, he made this expression, I remember: ‘_I have ways\r\nof making money that you know nothing of_.’”\r\n\r\nA few of the refiners contested before surrendering. Among these was\r\nRobert Hanna, an uncle of Mark Hanna, of the firm of Hanna, Baslington\r\nand Company. Mr. Hanna had been refining since July, 1869. According to\r\nhis own sworn statement he had made money, fully sixty per cent. on his\r\ninvestment the first year, and after that thirty per cent. Some time in\r\nFebruary, 1872, the Standard Oil Company asked an interview with him and\r\nhis associates. They wanted to buy his works, they said. “But we don’t\r\nwant to sell,” objected Mr. Hanna. “You can never make any more money,\r\nin my judgment,” said Mr. Rockefeller. “You can’t compete with the\r\nStandard. We have all the large refineries now. If you refuse to sell,\r\nit will end in your being crushed.” Hanna and Baslington were not\r\nsatisfied. They went to see Mr. Watson, president of the South\r\nImprovement Company and an officer of the Lake Shore, and General\r\nDevereux, manager of the Lake Shore road. They were told that the\r\nStandard had special rates; that it was useless to try to compete with\r\nthem. General Devereux explained to the gentlemen that the privileges\r\ngranted the Standard were the legitimate and necessary advantage of the\r\nlarger shipper over the smaller, and that if Hanna, Baslington and\r\nCompany could give the road as large a quantity of oil as the Standard\r\ndid, with the same regularity, they could have the same rate. General\r\nDevereux says they “recognised the propriety” of his excuse. They\r\ncertainly recognised its authority. They say that they were satisfied\r\nthey could no longer get rates to and from Cleveland which would enable\r\nthem to live, and “reluctantly” sold out. It must have been reluctantly,\r\nfor they had paid $75,000 for their works, and had made thirty per cent.\r\na year on an average on their investment, and the Standard appraiser\r\nallowed them $45,000. “Truly and really less than one-half of what they\r\nwere absolutely worth, with a fair and honest competition in the lines\r\nof transportation,” said Mr. Hanna, eight years later, in an\r\naffidavit.[14]\r\n\r\nUnder the combined threat and persuasion of the Standard, armed with the\r\nSouth Improvement Company scheme, almost the entire independent oil\r\ninterest of Cleveland collapsed in three months’ time. Of the twenty-six\r\nrefineries, at least twenty-one sold out. From a capacity of probably\r\nnot over 1,500 barrels of crude a day, the Standard Oil Company rose in\r\nthree months’ time to one of 10,000 barrels. By this manœuvre it became\r\nmaster of over one-fifth of the refining capacity of the United\r\nStates.[15] Its next individual competitor was Sone and Fleming, of New\r\nYork, whose capacity was 1,700 barrels. The Standard had a greater\r\ncapacity than the entire Oil Creek Regions, greater than the combined\r\nNew York refiners. The transaction by which it acquired this power was\r\nso stealthy that not even the best informed newspaper men of Cleveland\r\nknew what went on. It had all been accomplished in accordance with one\r\nof Mr. Rockefeller’s chief business principles—“Silence is golden.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Rockefeller was working out the “good of the oil business” in\r\nCleveland, his associates were busy at other points. Charles Lockhart in\r\nPittsburg and W. G. Warden in Philadelphia were particularly active,\r\nthough neither of them accomplished any such sweeping benefaction as Mr.\r\nRockefeller had. It was now evident what the stockholders of the South\r\nImprovement Company meant when they assured the railroads that all the\r\nrefiners were to go into the scheme, that, as Mr. Warden said, they\r\n“never had any other purpose in the matter!” A little more time and the\r\ngreat scheme would be an accomplished fact. And then there fell in its\r\npath two of those never-to-be-foreseen human elements which so often\r\nblock great manœuvres. The first was born of a man’s anger. The man had\r\nlearned of the scheme. He wanted to go into it, but the directors were\r\nsuspicious of him. He had been concerned in speculative enterprises and\r\nin dealings with the Erie road which had injured these directors in\r\nother ways. They didn’t want him to have any of the advantages of their\r\ngreat enterprise. When convinced that he could not share in the deal, he\r\ntook his revenge by telling people in the Oil Regions what was going on.\r\nAt first the Oil Regions refused to believe, but in a few days another\r\nslip born of human weakness came in to prove the rumour true. The\r\nschedule of rates agreed upon by the South Improvement Company and the\r\nrailroads had been sent to the freight agent of the Lake Shore Railroad,\r\nbut no order had been given to put them in force. The freight agent had\r\na son on his death-bed. Distracted by his sorrow, he left his office in\r\ncharge of subordinates, but neglected to tell them that the new\r\nschedules on his desk were a secret compact, whose effectiveness\r\ndepended upon their being held until all was complete. On February 26,\r\nthe subordinates, ignorant of the nature of the rates, put them into\r\neffect. The independent oil men heard with amazement that freight rates\r\nhad been put up nearly 100 per cent. They needed no other proof of the\r\ntruth of the rumours of conspiracy which were circulating. It now\r\nremained to be seen whether the Oil Regions would submit to the South\r\nImprovement Company as Cleveland had to the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER THREE\r\n                          THE OIL WAR OF 1872\r\n\r\n  RISING IN THE OIL REGIONS AGAINST THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT\r\n    COMPANY—PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION ORGANISED—OIL BLOCKADE AGAINST\r\n    MEMBERS OF SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY AND AGAINST RAILROADS\r\n    IMPLICATED—CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION OF 1872 AND THE DOCUMENTS IT\r\n    REVEALED—PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND GENERAL CONDEMNATION OF THE SOUTH\r\n    IMPROVEMENT COMPANY—RAILROAD OFFICIALS CONFER WITH COMMITTEE FROM\r\n    PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION—WATSON AND ROCKEFELLER REFUSED ADMITTANCE\r\n    TO CONFERENCE—RAILROADS REVOKE CONTRACTS WITH SOUTH IMPROVEMENT\r\n    COMPANY AND MAKE CONTRACT WITH PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION—BLOCKADE\r\n    AGAINST SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY LIFTED—OIL WAR OFFICIALLY\r\n    ENDED—ROCKEFELLER CONTINUES TO GET REBATES—HIS GREAT PLAN STILL A\r\n    LIVING PURPOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the middle of February, 1872, that the people of\r\nthe Oil Regions heard anything of the plan which was being worked out\r\nfor their “good.” Then an uneasy rumour began running up and down the\r\ncreek. Freight rates were going up. Now an advance in a man’s freight\r\nbill may ruin his business; more, it may mean the ruin of a region.\r\nRumour said that the new rate meant just this; that is, that it more\r\nthan covered the margin of profit in any branch of the oil business. The\r\nrailroads were not going to apply the proposed tariffs to everybody.\r\nThey had agreed to give to a company unheard of until now—the South\r\nImprovement Company—a special rate considerably lower than the new open\r\nrate. It was only a rumour and many people discredited it. _Why_ should\r\nthe railroads ruin the Oil Regions to build up a company of outsiders?\r\n\r\nBut facts began to be reported. Mr. Doane, the Cleveland shipper already\r\nquoted, told how suddenly on the 22d of February, without notice, his\r\nrate from the Oil Regions to Cleveland was put up from thirty-five cents\r\na barrel to sixty-five cents, an advance of twenty-four dollars on a\r\ncarload.[16] Mr. Josiah Lombard of the New York refining firm of Ayres,\r\nLombard and Company was buying oil for his company at Oil City. Their\r\nrefinery was running about 12,000 barrels a month. On the 19th of\r\nFebruary the rate from Oil City to Buffalo, which had been forty cents a\r\nbarrel, was raised to sixty-five cents, and a few days later the rate\r\nfrom Warren to New York was raised from eighty-seven cents to $2.14. Mr.\r\nLombard was not aware of this change until his house in New York\r\nreported to him that the bills for freight were so heavy that they could\r\nnot afford to ship and wanted to know what was the matter.[17]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of February 26, 1872, the oil men read in their morning\r\npapers that the rise which had been threatening had come; moreover, that\r\nall members of the South Improvement Company were exempt from the\r\nadvance. At the news all oildom rushed into the streets. Nobody waited\r\nto find out his neighbour’s opinion. On every lip there was but one\r\nword, and that was “conspiracy.” In the vernacular of the region, it was\r\nevident that “a torpedo was filling for that scheme.”\r\n\r\nIn twenty-four hours after the announcement of the increase in freight\r\nrates a mass-meeting of 3,000 excited, gesticulating oil men was\r\ngathered in the opera house at Titusville. Producers, brokers, refiners,\r\ndrillers, pumpers were in the crowd. Their temper was shown by the\r\nmottoes on the banners which they carried: “Down with the\r\nconspirators”—“No compromise”—“Don’t give up the ship!” Three days later\r\nas large a meeting was held at Oil City, its temper more warlike if\r\npossible; and so it went. They organised a Petroleum Producers’\r\nUnion,[18] pledged themselves to reduce their production by starting no\r\nnew wells for sixty days and by shutting down on Sundays, to sell no oil\r\nto any person known to be in the South Improvement Company, but to\r\nsupport the creek refiners and those elsewhere who had refused to go\r\ninto the combination, to boycott the offending railroads, and to build\r\nlines which they would own and control themselves. They sent a committee\r\nto the Legislature asking that the charter of the South Improvement\r\nCompany be repealed, and another to Congress demanding an investigation\r\nof the whole business on the ground that it was an interference with\r\ntrade. They ordered that a history of the conspiracy, giving the names\r\nof the conspirators and the designs of the company, should be prepared,\r\nand 30,000 copies sent to “judges of all courts, senators of the United\r\nStates, members of Congress and of State Legislatures, and to all\r\nrailroad men and prominent business men of the country, _to the end that\r\nenemies of the freedom of trade may be known and shunned by all honest\r\nmen_.”\r\n\r\nThey prepared a petition ninety-three feet long praying for a free\r\npipe-line bill, something which they had long wanted, but which, so far,\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad had prevented their getting, and sent it by a\r\ncommittee to the Legislature; and for days they kept 1,000 men ready to\r\nmarch on Harrisburg at a moment’s notice if the Legislature showed signs\r\nof refusing their demands. In short, for weeks the whole body of oil men\r\nabandoned regular business and surged from town to town intent on\r\ndestroying the “Monster,” the “Forty Thieves,” the “Great Anaconda,” as\r\nthey called the mysterious South Improvement Company. Curiously enough,\r\nit was chiefly against the combination which had secured the\r\ndiscrimination from the railroads—not the railroads which had granted\r\nit—that their fury was directed. They expected nothing but robbery from\r\nthe railroads, they said. They were used to that; but they would not\r\nendure it from men in their own business.\r\n\r\nWhen they began the fight the mass of the oil men knew nothing more of\r\nthe South Improvement Company than its name and the fact that it had\r\nsecured from the railroads advantages in rates which were bound to ruin\r\nall independent refiners of oil and to put all producers at its mercy.\r\nTheir tempers were not improved by the discovery that it was a secret\r\norganisation, and that it had been at work under their very eyes for\r\nsome weeks without their knowing it. At the first public meeting this\r\nfact came out, leading refiners of the region relating their experience\r\nwith the “Anaconda.” According to one of these gentlemen, J. D.\r\nArchbold—the same who afterward became vice-president of the Standard\r\nOil Company, which office he now holds—he and his partners had heard of\r\nthe scheme some months before. Alarmed by the rumour, a committee of\r\nindependent refiners had attempted to investigate, but could learn\r\nnothing until they had given a promise not to reveal what was told them.\r\nWhen convinced that a company had been formed actually strong enough to\r\nforce or persuade the railroads to give it special rates and refuse them\r\nto all persons outside, Mr. Archbold said that he and his colleagues had\r\ngone to the railway kings to remonstrate, but all to no effect. The\r\nSouth Improvement Company by some means had convinced the railroads that\r\nthey owned the Oil Regions, producers and refiners both, and that\r\nhereafter no oil of any account would be shipped except as they shipped\r\nit. Mr. Archbold and his partners had been asked to join the company,\r\nbut had refused, declaring that the whole business was iniquitous, that\r\nthey would fight it to the end, and that in their fight they would have\r\nthe backing of the oil men as a whole. They excused their silence up to\r\nthis time by citing the pledge[19] exacted from them before they were\r\ninformed of the extent and nature of the South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\nNaturally the burning question throughout the Oil Regions, convinced as\r\nit was of the iniquity of the scheme, was, Who are the conspirators?\r\nWhether the gentlemen concerned regarded themselves in the light of\r\n“conspirators” or not, they seem from the first to have realised that it\r\nwould be discreet not to be identified publicly with the scheme, and to\r\nhave allowed one name alone to appear in all signed negotiations. This\r\nwas the name of the president, Peter H. Watson. However anxious the\r\nmembers of the South Improvement Company were that Mr. Watson should\r\ncombine the honours of president with the trials of scapegoat, it was\r\nimpossible to keep their names concealed. The Oil City Derrick, at that\r\ntime one of the most vigorous, witty, and daring newspapers in the\r\ncountry, began a black list at the head of its editorial columns the day\r\nafter the raise in freight was announced, and it kept it there until it\r\nwas believed complete. It stood finally as it appears on the opposite\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThis list was not exact, but it was enough to go on, and the oil\r\nblockade, to which the Petroleum Producers’ Union had pledged itself,\r\nwas now enforced against the firms listed, and as far as possible\r\nagainst the railroads. All of these refineries had their buyers on the\r\ncreek, and although several of them were young men generally liked for\r\ntheir personal and business qualities, no mercy was shown them. They\r\nwere refused oil by everybody, though they offered from seventy-five\r\ncents to a dollar more than the market price. They were ordered at one\r\nmeeting “to desist from their nefarious business or leave the Oil\r\nRegion,” and when they declined they were invited to resign from the oil\r\nexchanges of which they were members. So strictly, indeed, was the\r\nblockade enforced that in Cleveland the refineries were closed and\r\nmeetings for the relief of the workmen were held. In spite of the\r\nexcitement there was little vandalism, the only violence at the opening\r\nof the war being at Franklin, where a quantity of the oil belonging to\r\nMr. Watson was run on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ARCHBOLD IN 1872\r\n\r\n  Now vice-president of the Standard Oil Company. Mr. Archbold, whose\r\n    home, in 1872, was in Titusville, Pennsylvania, although one of the\r\n    youngest refiners of the Creek, was one of the most active and\r\n    efficient in breaking up the South Improvement Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                            THE BLACK LIST.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Behold “The Anaconda” in all his hideous deformity!\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sudden uprising of the Oil Regions against the South Improvement\r\nCompany did not alarm its members at first. The excitement would die\r\nout, they told one another. All that they needed to do was to keep quiet\r\nand stay out of the oil country. But the excitement did not die out.\r\nIndeed, with every day it became more intense and more wide-spread. When\r\nMr. Watson’s tanks were tapped he began to protest in letters to a\r\nfriend, F. W. Mitchell, a prominent banker and oil man of Franklin. The\r\ncompany was misunderstood, he complained. “Have a committee of leading\r\nproducers appointed,” he wrote, “and we will show that the contracts\r\nwith the railroads are as favourable to the producing as to other\r\ninterests; that the much-denounced rebate will enhance the price of oil\r\nat the wells, and that our entire plan in operation and effect will\r\npromote every legitimate American interest in the oil trade.” Mr.\r\nMitchell urged Mr. Watson to come openly to the Oil Regions and meet the\r\nproducers as a body. A mass-meeting was never a “deliberative body,” Mr.\r\nWatson replied, but if a few of the leading oil men would go to Albany\r\nor New York, or any place favourable to calm investigation and\r\ndeliberation, and therefore outside of the atmosphere of excitement\r\nwhich enveloped the oil country, he would see them. These letters were\r\nread to the producers, and a motion to appoint a committee was made. It\r\nwas received with protests and jeers. Mr. Watson was afraid to come to\r\nthe Oil Regions, they said. The letters were not addressed to the\r\nassociation, they were private—an insult to the body. “We are lowering\r\nour dignity to treat with this man Watson,” declared one man. “He is\r\nfree to come to these meetings if he wants to.” “What is there to\r\nnegotiate about?” asked another. “To open a negotiation is to concede\r\nthat we are wrong. Can we go halves with these middlemen in their\r\nswindle?” “He has set a trap for us,” declared another. “We cannot treat\r\nwith him without guilt,” and the motion was voted down.\r\n\r\nThe stopping of the oil supply finally forced the South Improvement\r\nCompany to recognise the Producers’ Union officially by asking that a\r\ncommittee of the body be appointed to confer with them on a compromise.\r\nThe producers sent back a pertinent answer. They believed the South\r\nImprovement Company meant to monopolise the oil business. If that was so\r\nthey could not consider a compromise with it. If they were wrong, they\r\nwould be glad to be enlightened, and they asked for information. First:\r\nthe charter under which the South Improvement Company was organised.\r\nSecond: the articles of association. Third: the officers’ names. Fourth:\r\nthe contracts with the railroads which signed them. Fifth: the general\r\nplan of management. Until we know these things, the oil men declared, we\r\ncan no more negotiate with you than we could sit down to negotiate with\r\na burglar as to his privileges in our house.\r\n\r\nThe Producers’ Union did not get the information they asked from the\r\ncompany at that time, but it was not long before they had it, and much\r\nmore. The committee which they had appointed to write a history of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company reported on March 20, and in April the\r\nCongressional Committee appointed at the insistence of the oil men made\r\nits investigation. The former report was published broadcast, and is\r\nreadily accessible to-day. The Congressional Investigation was not\r\npublished officially, and no trace of its work can now be found in\r\nWashington, but while it was going on reports were made in the\r\nnewspapers of the Oil Regions, and at its close the Producers’ Union\r\npublished in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a pamphlet called “A History of\r\nthe Rise and Fall of the South Improvement Company,” which contains the\r\nfull testimony taken by the committee. This pamphlet is rare, the writer\r\nnever having been able to find a copy save in three or four private\r\ncollections. The most important part of it is the testimony of Peter H.\r\nWatson, the president, and W. G. Warden, the secretary of the South\r\nImprovement Company. It was in these documents that the oil men found\r\nfull justification for the war they were carrying on and for the losses\r\nthey had caused themselves and others. Nothing, indeed, could have been\r\nmore damaging to a corporation than the publication of the charter of\r\nthe South Improvement Company. As its president told the Congressional\r\nInvestigating Committee, when he was under examination, “this charter\r\nwas a sort of clothes-horse to hang a scheme upon.” As a matter of fact\r\nit was a clothes-horse big enough to hang the earth upon. It granted\r\npowers practically unlimited. There really was no exaggeration in the\r\nsummary of its powers made and scattered broadcast by the irate oil men\r\nin their “History of the Rise and Fall of the South Improvement\r\nCompany”:[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The South Improvement Company can own, contract, or operate any\r\n  work, business, or traffic (save only banking); may hold and\r\n  transfer any kind of property, real or personal; hold and operate on\r\n  any leased property (oil territory, for instance); make any kind of\r\n  contract; deal in stock, securities, and funds; loan its credit,\r\n  guarantee any one’s paper; manipulate any industry; may seize upon\r\n  the lands of other parties for railroading or _any other purpose_;\r\n  may absorb the improvements, property or franchises of any other\r\n  company, _ad infinitum_; may fix the fares, tolls, or freights to be\r\n  charged on lines of transit operated by it, or on any business it\r\n  gives to _any other company_ or line, without limit.\r\n\r\n  Its capital stock can be expanded or “watered” at liberty; it can\r\n  change its name and location at pleasure; can go anywhere and do\r\n  almost anything. It is not a Pennsylvania corporation only; it can,\r\n  so far as these enactments are valid, or are confirmed by other\r\n  Legislatures, operate in any state or territory; its directors must\r\n  be only citizens of the United States—not necessarily of\r\n  Pennsylvania. It is responsible to no one; its stockholders are only\r\n  liable to the amount of their stock in it; its directors, when\r\n  wielding all the princely powers of the corporation, are also\r\n  responsible only to the amount of their stock in it; it may control\r\n  the business of the continent and hold and transfer millions of\r\n  property, and yet be rotten to the core. It is responsible to no\r\n  one; makes no reports of its acts or financial condition; its\r\n  records and deliberations are secret; its capital illimitable; its\r\n  object unknown. It can be here to-day, to-morrow away. Its domain is\r\n  the whole country; its business everything. Now it is petroleum it\r\n  grasps and monopolises; next year it may be iron, coal, cotton, or\r\n  breadstuffs. They are landsmen granted perpetual letters of marque\r\n  to prey upon all commerce everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the course of this charter through the Pennsylvania Legislature\r\ncame to be traced, it was found to be devious and uncertain. The company\r\nhad been incorporated in 1871, and vested with all the “powers,\r\nprivileges, duties and obligations” of an earlier company—incorporated\r\nin April, 1870—the Pennsylvania Company; both of them were children of\r\nthat interesting body known as the “Tom Scott Legislature.” The act\r\nincorporating the company was not published until after the oil war; its\r\nsponsor was never known, and no votes on it are recorded. The origin of\r\nthe South Improvement Company has always remained in darkness. It was\r\none of several “improvement” companies chartered in Pennsylvania at\r\nabout the same time, and enjoying the same commercial _carte blanche_.\r\n\r\nBad as the charter was in appearance, the oil men found that the\r\ncontracts which the new company had made with the railroads were worse.\r\nThese contracts advanced the rates of freight from the Oil Regions over\r\n100 per cent.—an advance which more than covered the margin of profit on\r\ntheir business—but it was not the railroad that got the greater part of\r\nthis advance; it was the South Improvement Company. Not only did it ship\r\nits own oil at fully a dollar a barrel cheaper on an average than\r\nanybody else could, but it received fully a dollar a barrel “rake-off”\r\non every barrel its competitors shipped. It was computed and admitted by\r\nthe members of the company who appeared before the investigating\r\ncommittee of Congress that this discrimination would have turned over to\r\nthem fully $6,000,000 annually on the carrying trade. The railroads\r\nexpected to receive about one and a half millions more than from the\r\nexisting rates. That is, an additional cost of about $1.25 a barrel was\r\nadded to crude oil, and it was computed that this would enable the\r\nrefiners to advance their wholesale price at least four cents a gallon.\r\nIt is hardly to be wondered at that when the oil men had before them the\r\nfull text of these contracts they refused absolutely to accept the\r\nrepeated assertions of the members of the South Improvement Company that\r\ntheir scheme was intended only for “the good of the oil business.” The\r\ncommittee of Congress could not be persuaded to believe it either. “Your\r\nsuccess meant the destruction of every refiner who refused for any\r\nreason to join your company, or whom you did not care to have in, and it\r\nput the producers entirely in your power. It would make a monopoly such\r\nas no set of men are fit to handle,” the chairman of the committee\r\ndeclared. Of course Mr. Warden, the secretary of the company, protested\r\nagain and again that they meant to take in all the refiners, but when he\r\nhad to admit that the contracts with the railroads were not made on this\r\ncondition, his protestations met with little credence. Besides, there\r\nwas the damning fact that no refiners had come in except those in\r\nCleveland, and that they with one accord testified that they had yielded\r\nto force. Not a single factory in either New York or the Oil Regions was\r\nin the combination. The fact that the producers had never been\r\napproached in any way looked very bad for the company, too. Mr. Watson\r\naffirmed and reaffirmed before the committee that it was the intention\r\nof the company to take care of the producers. “It was an essential part\r\nof this contract that the producers should join it,” he declared. But no\r\nsuch condition was embodied in the contract. It was verbal only, and,\r\nbesides, it had never been submitted to the producers themselves in any\r\nform until after the trouble in the Oil Regions began. The committee,\r\nlike the oil men, insisted that under the circumstances no such verbal\r\nunderstanding was to be trusted.[21]\r\n\r\nNo part of the testimony before the committee made a worse impression\r\nthan that showing that the chief object of the combination was to put up\r\nthe price of refined oil to the consumer, though nobody had denied from\r\nthe first that this was the purpose. In a circular, intended for private\r\ncirculation, which appeared in the newspapers about this time explaining\r\nthe objects of the South Improvement Company, this was made clear:\r\n\r\n“The object of this combination of interests,” ran the circular, “is\r\nunderstood to be twofold: firstly, to do away, at least in a great\r\nmeasure, with the excessive and undue competition now existing between\r\nthe refining interest, by reason of there being a far greater refining\r\ncapacity than is called for or justified by the existing\r\npetroleum-consuming requirements of the world; secondly, to avoid the\r\nheretofore undue competition between the various railroad companies\r\ntransporting oil to the seaboard, by fixing a uniform rate of freight,\r\nwhich it is thought can be adhered to by some such arrangement as\r\nguaranteeing to each road some such percentages of the profit of the\r\naggregate amount of oil transported, whether the particular line carries\r\nit or not. It is also asserted that a prominent feature of the\r\ncombination will be to limit the production of refined petroleum to such\r\namounts as may serve, in a great measure, to do away with the serious\r\nperiodical depressions in the article. Is it also to be expected that,\r\ndesiring to curtail the production of refined petroleum in this country,\r\nthe railroads will not offer any additional facilities for exportation\r\nof the crude article.”\r\n\r\nA writer in the Oil City Derrick, quoted in the Cleveland Herald, March\r\n2, 1872, said: “The ring pretend that they will make their margin out of\r\nthe consumers. That is, that they will put refined up to a figure that\r\nwill enable them to pay well for crude.... The consumers are the avowed\r\nvictims, since they must pay a price which will warrant the ring in\r\ngoing on with their operations. And the producers’ security for the\r\nprice is a mere matter of discretion.”\r\n\r\nWherever the members of the company discussed the subject they put\r\nforward this object as one sufficient to justify the combination. If\r\nrefined oil was put up everybody in the trade would make more money. To\r\nthis end the public ought to be willing to pay more.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Warden was under examination by the committee the chairman said\r\nto him: “Under your arrangement, the public would have been put to an\r\nadditional expense of $7,500,000 a year.” “What public?” said Mr.\r\nWarden. “They would have had to pay it in Europe.” “But to keep up the\r\nprice abroad you would have to keep up the price at home,” said the\r\nchairman. Mr. Warden conceded the point: “You could not get a better\r\nprice for that exported without having a better price here,” he\r\nsaid.[22]\r\n\r\nMr. Watson contended that the price could be put up with benefit to the\r\nconsumer. And when he was asked how, he replied: “By steadying the\r\ntrade. You will notice what all those familiar with this trade know,\r\nthat there are very rapid and excessive fluctuations in the oil market;\r\nthat when these fluctuations take place the retail dealers are always\r\nquick to note a rise in price, but very slow to note a fall. Even if two\r\ndollars a barrel had been added to the price of oil under a steady\r\ntrade, I think the price of the retail purchaser would not have been\r\nincreased. That increased price would only amount to one cent a quart\r\n(four cents a gallon), and I think the price would not have been\r\nincreased to the retail dealer because the fluctuations would have been\r\navoided. That was one object to be accomplished.”[23]\r\n\r\nThe committee were not convinced, however, that a scheme which began by\r\nadding four cents to the price of a gallon of oil could be to the good\r\nof the consumer. Nor did anything appear in the contracts which showed\r\nhow the fluctuations in the price of oil were to be avoided. These\r\nfluctuations were due to the rise and fall in the crude market, and that\r\ndepended on the amount of crude coming from the ground. The South\r\nImprovement Company might assert that they meant to bring the producers\r\ninto their scheme and persuade them to keep down the amount of\r\nproduction in the same way they meant to keep down refined, so that the\r\nprice could be kept steadily high, but they had nothing to prove that\r\nthey were sincere in the intention, nothing to prove that they had\r\nthought of the producer seriously until the trouble in the Oil Regions\r\nbegan. It looked very much to the committee as if the real intention of\r\nthe company was to keep up the price of refined to a certain figure by\r\nlimiting the output, and that there was nothing to show that it would\r\nnot go up with crude though it might not go down with it! Under these\r\ncircumstances it seemed as if a fluctuating market which gave a moderate\r\naverage was better for the consumer than the steady high price which Mr.\r\nWatson thought so good for the public. Thirty-two cents a gallon was the\r\nideal price they had in view, though refined had not sold for that since\r\n1869, the average price in 1870 being 26⅜ and in 1871 24¼. The refiner\r\nwho in 1871 sold his oil at 24¼ cents a gallon cleared easily fifty-two\r\ncents a barrel—a large profit on his investment,—but the refiners in the\r\nearly stages of this new industry had made much larger profits. It was\r\nto perpetuate these early profits that they had gone into the South\r\nImprovement Company.\r\n\r\nIt did not take the full exposition of the objects of the South\r\nImprovement Company, brought out by the Congressional Investigating\r\nCommittee, with the publication of charters and contracts, to convince\r\nthe country at large that the Oil Regions were right in their\r\nopposition. From the first the sympathy of the press and the people were\r\nwith the oil men. It was evident to everybody that if the railroads had\r\nmade the contracts as charged (and it daily became more evident they had\r\ndone so), nothing but an absolute monopoly of the whole oil business by\r\nthis combination could result. It was robbery, cried the newspapers all\r\nover the land. “Under the thin guise of assisting in the development of\r\noil-refining in Pittsburg and Cleveland,” said the New York Tribune,\r\n“this corporation has simply laid its hand upon the throat of the oil\r\ntraffic with a demand to ‘stand and deliver.’” And if this could be done\r\nin the oil business, what was to prevent its being done in any other\r\nindustry? Why should not a company be formed to control wheat or beef or\r\niron or steel, as well as oil? If the railroads would do this for one\r\ncompany, why not for another? The South Improvement Company, men agreed,\r\nwas a menace to the free trade of the country. If the oil men yielded\r\nnow, all industries must suffer from their weakness. The railroads must\r\nbe taught a lesson as well as would-be monopolists.\r\n\r\nThe oil men had no thought of yielding. With every day of the war their\r\nbackbone grew stiffer. The men were calmer, too, for their resistance\r\nhad found a ground which seemed impregnable to them, and arguments\r\nagainst the South Improvement Company now took the place of\r\ndenunciations. On all sides men said, This is a transportation question,\r\nand now is the time to put an end once and forever to the rebates. The\r\nsentiment against discrimination on account of amount of freight or for\r\nany other reason had been strong in the country since its beginning, and\r\nit now crystallised immediately. The country so buzzed with discussion\r\non the duties of the railroads that reporters sent from the Eastern\r\nnewspapers commented on it. Nothing was commoner, indeed, on the trains\r\nwhich ran the length of the region and were its real forums, than to\r\nhear a man explaining that the railways derived their existence and\r\npower from the people, that their charters were contracts with the\r\npeople, that a fundamental provision of these contracts was that there\r\nshould be no discriminating in favour of one person or one town, that\r\nsuch a discrimination was a violation of charter, that therefore the\r\nSouth Improvement Company was founded on fraud, and the courts must\r\ndissolve it if the railways did not abandon it. The Petroleum Producers’\r\nUnion which had been formed to grapple with the “Monster” actually\r\ndemanded interstate regulation, for in a circular sent out to newspapers\r\nand boards of trade asking their aid against the conspiracy they\r\nincluded this paragraph: “We urge you to exert all your influence with\r\nyour representatives in Congress to support such measures offered there\r\nas will prohibit for all future time any monopoly of railroads or other\r\ntransportation companies from laying embargoes upon the trade between\r\nstates by a system of excessive freights or unjust discrimination\r\nagainst buyers or shippers in any trade by the allowance of rebates or\r\ndrawbacks to any persons whatever. This is a matter of national\r\nimportance, and only the most decided action can protect you and us from\r\nthe scheming strength of these monopolies.”\r\n\r\nHow the whole question appeared to an intelligent oil man, one, too, who\r\nhad had the courage to resist in the attack on the trade in Cleveland,\r\nand who still was master of his own refinery, is shown by the following\r\nletter to the Cleveland Herald:\r\n\r\n\r\n  EDS. HERALD: As I understand, the financial success of this South\r\n  Improvement Company is based upon contracts made with the officers\r\n  (either individually or otherwise) of all the railroads leading out\r\n  of the Oil Region, by which they (the South Improvement Company)\r\n  receive as a drawback certain excess of freights, not only on every\r\n  barrel of oil shipped out of the Oil Regions by or to themselves,\r\n  but also on every barrel of oil shipped out of the Oil Regions by or\r\n  to other refiners, or dealers, or consumers.\r\n\r\n  The first advance in freights to Cleveland has already been made,\r\n  viz.: on crude oil, from forty cents to sixty-five cents per barrel.\r\n  This seemingly slight advance has already caused one party that I\r\n  know of to pay an excess of over $2,000. Other firms have paid\r\n  larger or smaller sums, according to the quantity of oil they were\r\n  compelled to have. This excess, we suppose, goes directly to swell\r\n  the profits of the South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\n  _This is only the beginning._ The whole extent of the evil that may\r\n  be done to producers, refiners, dealers and consumers, and to the\r\n  public generally, if this corporation—or rather combination of\r\n  corporations—is successful, is so deep and varied and far reaching,\r\n  that it cannot be fully comprehended and I will not attempt it in\r\n  detail, but only suggest a few inquiries.\r\n\r\n  Where will be their limits?\r\n\r\n  How high will they advance freights?\r\n\r\n  How low will they force the price of crude?\r\n\r\n  How high refined?\r\n\r\n  Will they adopt a liberal policy for producers, or will they destroy\r\n  their interests and _crush out_ the oil production entirely? Will\r\n  they be liberal with dealers and consumers and adopt uniform rules\r\n  with steady prices, or will they take advantage of times and\r\n  circumstances and force ruinous corners upon the trade?\r\n\r\n  These and many other questions are pertinent, for clearly if they\r\n  can control the shipment they can control the price of oil, and if\r\n  they can control the price to the extent of twenty-five cents per\r\n  barrel, they can control it entirely. If they can control it\r\n  entirely, where will be their limit? Who will dictate a line of\r\n  policy to them? And may not one of the greatest and most important\r\n  industries of this country be destroyed and hundreds of thousands of\r\n  business men be made bankrupt if this combination is successful and\r\n  has the disposition to work ruin? I do not say that I think they\r\n  will work ruin. They undoubtedly will attempt to make all the money\r\n  they can and will pursue such a policy as in their judgment will\r\n  bring them the utmost amount of profits, regardless of consequences,\r\n  but what that policy will be, of course, we can not judge.\r\n\r\n  It is understood that the parties to this combination excuse\r\n  themselves and their action before the public by reciting the\r\n  undoubted facts in the case. They are these: that the refining of\r\n  oil as a business has been of late and is now overdone; that the\r\n  capacity for refining petroleum in this country exceeds the\r\n  production in the ratio of three barrels to one; that the railroads\r\n  have reduced freights to the lowest extreme, and were even losing\r\n  money; that refiners, in spite of all their efforts, could not earn\r\n  their running expenses; that the _special interests of Cleveland_ as\r\n  a refining point were in danger of being lost; and that this great\r\n  business might go to other points, and the millions of dollars in\r\n  refining property here be sacrificed, and thousands of men thrown\r\n  out of employment; that real estate would depreciate, and that many\r\n  other collateral troubles connected with the loss of this business\r\n  would follow; and that _now_, by the consummation of the plans of\r\n  this monopoly, all these evils will be avoided.\r\n\r\n  In answer to this—assuming that the refining interest of Cleveland\r\n  is a _unit_ in this corporation, that of Pittsburg another, that of\r\n  New York another, and that of Philadelphia another—it follows that\r\n  it is immaterial to the stockholders of the “South Improvement\r\n  Company” whether the oil produced at the Oil Regions is refined by\r\n  them at their works in Cleveland, or at Pittsburg, or in New York,\r\n  or in Philadelphia. It would not affect their dividends at all,\r\n  provided they refined the oil at the cheapest point for them to do\r\n  so. That place might be Cleveland; it might be Pittsburg, or it\r\n  might _not_ be either of them; but it might be New York or\r\n  Philadelphia. Therefore, so long as it is for the pecuniary\r\n  advantage of this combination to refine at Cleveland they may do so,\r\n  but no longer, and should it be for the interest of the combination\r\n  to discontinue their works at Cleveland, what would become of the\r\n  oil-refining interest at this point? That question everyone can\r\n  answer. Therefore I see little weight to the argument used that this\r\n  monopoly is for the benefit of Cleveland. Hence, I do not consider\r\n  the _special danger_ to Cleveland by any means as averted.\r\n\r\n  But without discussing this position, its advantages or\r\n  disadvantages, as an oil-refining center—for it has both in a marked\r\n  degree—on general principles I will assert that the laws of business\r\n  and manufacturing interests, like the laws of supply and demand, are\r\n  unchangeable, and that a prosperity such as this monopoly would\r\n  bring us is a forced prosperity, consequently not permanent, but\r\n  temporary and fictitious in character, and damaging in its ultimate\r\n  results; and more than all this, if the refining prosperity of\r\n  Cleveland could be re-established permanently by means of the\r\n  success of this monopoly, we could not afford to accept it at the\r\n  cost proposed, viz., that of enriching ourselves at the expense of\r\n  those who are weaker, but are in power.\r\n\r\n  We have just refused to build an opera house because we should, by\r\n  using the only means we could command to do so, compromise our\r\n  morality. How much more emphatically should we refuse to accept any\r\n  benefits to our city which have their origin in unmitigated fraud!\r\n  In the opera house instance just cited the managers use no\r\n  compulsion, no unwilling man was to be forced by them to buy a\r\n  ticket and take his chances; but the South Improvement Company force\r\n  every producer to take a less price for his oil without rendering\r\n  him an equivalent.\r\n\r\n  They force every refiner who is in their way to prosecute his\r\n  business against them as competitors at fearful odds, and perhaps at\r\n  the expense of a royalty on every barrel; or to sell his works and\r\n  abandon his business to the South Improvement Company at any paltry\r\n  price they may dictate.\r\n\r\n  They also force every consumer of oil on this broad continent, after\r\n  paying all the legitimate cost of producing, refining, and\r\n  transportation on oil, to pay them also an additional tribute—for\r\n  what? Absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n  The railroad companies derive their existence and power to act under\r\n  charters granted them by the citizens (through their Legislatures)\r\n  of the several states in which they exist. This charter is a\r\n  contract made by and between the citizens of the one part and the\r\n  railroad company on the other, and both parties bind themselves\r\n  alike to the faithful performance of the conditions of the contract.\r\n  One of the fundamental provisions of this contract is that there\r\n  shall be no discrimination shown to any individuals, or body of\r\n  individuals, as to facilities or privileges of doing business with\r\n  such railroad company; on the contrary, the railroad company is\r\n  expressly required in all cases to charge uniform rates for the\r\n  transportation of freight and passengers.\r\n\r\n  They must, if desired, carry the freight for A that they do for B,\r\n  AND ALWAYS AT THE SAME PRICE. Any deviation from this stipulated\r\n  condition is a wilful and fraudulent violation of their contract. If\r\n  it is by means of such violations of contracts on the part of the\r\n  several railroad companies connected with them that the South\r\n  Improvement Company expects success, then the whole gigantic\r\n  STRUCTURE IS ESTABLISHED UPON FRAUD AS A BASIS, AND IT OUGHT TO COME\r\n  DOWN.\r\n\r\n                                 Very respectfully,\r\n                                                         F. M. BACKUS.\r\n\r\n  CLEVELAND, OHIO, March 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oil men now met the very plausible reasons given by the members of\r\nthe company for their combination more intelligently than at first.\r\nThere were grave abuses in the business, they admitted; there was too\r\ngreat refining capacity; but this they argued was a natural development\r\nin a new business whose growth had been extraordinary and whose limits\r\nwere by no means defined. Time and experience would regulate it. Give\r\nthe refiners open and regular freights, with no favours to any one, and\r\nthe stronger and better equipped would live, the others die—but give all\r\na chance. In fact, time and energy would regulate all the evils of which\r\nthey complained if there were fair play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY H. ROGERS IN 1872\r\n\r\n  Now President of the National Transit Company and a director of the\r\n    Standard Oil Company. The opposition to the South Improvement\r\n    Company among the New York refiners was led by Mr. Rogers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe oil men were not only encouraged by public opinion and by getting\r\ntheir minds clear on the merits of their case; they were upheld by\r\nrepeated proofs of aid from all sides; even the women of the region were\r\nasking what they could do, and were offering to wear their “black velvet\r\nbonnets” all summer if necessary. Solid support came from the\r\nindependent refiners and shippers in other parts of the country who were\r\noffering to stand in with them in their contest. New York was already\r\none of the chief refining centres of the country, and the South\r\nImprovement Company had left it entirely out of its combination. As\r\nincensed as the creek itself, the New York interests formed an\r\nassociation, and about the middle of March sent a committee of three,\r\nwith H. H. Rogers, of Charles Pratt and Company, at its head, to Oil\r\nCity, to consult with the Producers’ Union. Their arrival in the Oil\r\nRegions was a matter of great satisfaction. What made the oil men most\r\nexultant, however, was their growing belief that the railroads—the crux\r\nof the whole scheme—were weakening.\r\n\r\nHowever fair the great scheme may have appeared to the railroad kings in\r\nthe privacy of the council chamber, it began to look dark as soon as it\r\nwas dragged into the open, and signs of a scuttle soon appeared. General\r\nG. B. McClellan, president of the Atlantic and Great Western, sent to\r\nthe very first mass-meeting this telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          NEW YORK, February 27, 1872.\r\n\r\n  Neither the Atlantic and Great Western, nor any of its officers, are\r\n  interested in the South Improvement Company. Of course the policy of\r\n  the road is to accommodate the petroleum interest.\r\n\r\n                                                      G. B. MCCLELLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great applause was started, only to be stopped by the hisses of a\r\ngroup whose spokesman read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Contract with South Improvement Company signed by George B.\r\n  McClellan, president for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. I\r\n  only signed it after it was signed by all the other parties.\r\n\r\n                                                            JAY GOULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe railroads tried in various ways to appease the oil men. They did not\r\nenforce the new rates. They had signed the contracts, they declared,\r\nonly after the South Improvement Company had assured them that all the\r\nrefineries and producers were to be taken in. Indeed, they seem to have\r\nrealised within a fortnight that the scheme was doomed, and to have been\r\nquite ready to meet cordially a committee of oil men which went East to\r\ndemand that the railroads revoke their contracts with the South\r\nImprovement Company. This committee, which was composed of twelve\r\npersons, three of them being the New York representatives already\r\nmentioned, began its work by an interview with Colonel Scott at the\r\nColonial Hotel in Philadelphia. With evident pride the committee wrote\r\nback to the Producers’ Union: “Mr. Scott, differing in this respect from\r\nthe railroad representatives whom we afterwards met, notified us that he\r\nwould call upon us at our hotel.” An interesting account of their\r\ninterview was given to the Hepburn Committee in 1879 by W. T. Scheide,\r\none of the number:\r\n\r\n\r\n  We saw Mr. Scott on the 18th of March, 1872, in Philadelphia, and he\r\n  said to us that he was very much surprised to hear of this agitation\r\n  in the Oil Regions; that the object of the railroads in making this\r\n  contract with the South Improvement Company was to obtain an evener\r\n  to pool the freight—pool the oil freights among the different roads;\r\n  that they had been cutting each other on oil freights for a number\r\n  of years, and had not made any money out of it, although it was a\r\n  freight they should have made money from; that they had endeavoured\r\n  to make an arrangement among themselves, but had always failed; he\r\n  said that they supposed that the gentlemen representing the South\r\n  Improvement Company represented the petroleum trade, but as he was\r\n  now convinced they did not, he would be very glad to make an\r\n  arrangement with this committee, who undoubtedly did represent the\r\n  petroleum trade; the committee told him that they could not make any\r\n  such contract; that they had no legal authority to do so; he said\r\n  that could be easily fixed, because the Legislature was then in\r\n  session, and by going to Harrisburg a charter could be obtained in a\r\n  very few days; the committee still said that they would not agree to\r\n  any such arrangement, that they did not think the South Improvement\r\n  Company’s contract was a good one, and they were instructed to have\r\n  it broken, and so they did not feel that they could accept a similar\r\n  one, even if they had the power.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Colonel Scott the committee went on to New York, where they\r\nstayed for about a week, closely watched by the newspapers, all of which\r\ntreated the “Oil War” as a national affair. Their first interview of\r\nimportance in New York was with Commodore Vanderbilt, who said to them\r\nvery frankly at the beginning of their talk: “I told Billy (W. H.\r\nVanderbilt) not to have anything to do with that scheme.” The committee\r\nin its report said that the Commodore fully agreed with them upon the\r\njustice of their claims, and frequently asserted his objections to any\r\ncombination seeking a monopoly of other men’s property and interests. He\r\ntold them that if what they asked was that the railroads should fix a\r\ntariff which, while giving them a paying rate, would secure the oil men\r\nagainst drawbacks, rebates, or variations in the tariff, he would\r\nwillingly co-operate. The Commodore ended his amiable concessions by\r\nreading the committee a letter just received from the South Improvement\r\nCompany offering to co-operate with the producers and refiners or to\r\ncompromise existing differences. The oil men told the Commodore\r\nemphatically that they would not treat with the South Improvement\r\nCompany or with anyone interested in it nor would they recognise its\r\nexistence. And this stand they kept throughout their negotiations though\r\nrepeated efforts were made by the railroad men, particularly those of\r\nthe Central system, to persuade them to a compromise.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting with the officials of the Erie and the Atlantic and Great\r\nWestern the committee was incensed by being offered a contract similar\r\nto that of the South Improvement Company—on consideration that the\r\noriginal be allowed to stand. It seemed impossible to the railroad men\r\nthat the oil men really meant what they said and would make no terms\r\nsave on the basis of no discriminations of any kind to anybody. They\r\nevidently believed that if the committee had a chance to sign a contract\r\nas profitable as that of the South Improvement Company, all their fair\r\ntalk of “fair play”—“the duty of the common carrier”—“equal chance to\r\nall in transportation”—would at once evaporate. They failed utterly at\r\nfirst to comprehend that the Oil War of 1872 was an uprising against an\r\ninjustice, and that the moral wrong of the thing had taken so deep a\r\nhold of the oil country that the people as a whole had combined to\r\nrestore right. General McClellan of the Atlantic and Great Western and\r\nMr. Diven, one of the Erie’s directors, were the only ones who gave the\r\ncommittee any support in their position.\r\n\r\nThe final all-important conference with the railroad men was held on\r\nMarch 25, at the Erie offices. Horace Clark, president of the Lake Shore\r\nand Michigan Southern Railroad, was chairman of this meeting, and,\r\naccording to H. H. Rogers’ testimony before the Hepburn Committee, in\r\n1879, there were present, besides the oil men, Colonel Scott, General\r\nMcClellan, Director Diven, William H. Vanderbilt, Mr. Stebbins, and\r\nGeorge Hall. The meeting had not been long in session before Mr. Watson,\r\npresident of the South Improvement Company, and John D. Rockefeller\r\npresented themselves for admission. Up to this time Mr. Rockefeller had\r\nkept well out of sight in the affair. He had given no interviews,\r\noffered no explanations. He had allowed the president of the company to\r\nwrestle with the excitement in his own way, but things were now in such\r\ncritical shape that he came forward in a last attempt to save the\r\norganisation by which he had been able to concentrate in his own hands\r\nthe refining interests of Cleveland. With Mr. Watson he knocked for\r\nadmission to the council going on in the Erie offices. The oil men\r\nflatly refused to let them in. A dramatic scene followed, Mr. Clark, the\r\nchairman, protesting in agitated tones against shutting out his\r\n“lifelong friend, Watson.” The oil men were obdurate. They would have\r\nnothing to do with anybody concerned with the South Improvement Company.\r\nSo determined were they that although Mr. Watson came in he was obliged\r\nat once to withdraw. A Times reporter who witnessed the little scene\r\nbetween the two supporters of the tottering company after its president\r\nwas turned out of the meeting remarked sympathetically that Mr.\r\nRockefeller soon went away, “looking pretty blue.”\r\n\r\nThe acquiescence of the “railroad kings” in the refusal of the oil men\r\nto recognise representatives of the South Improvement Company was\r\nfollowed by an unwilling promise to break the contracts with the\r\ncompany. Another strong effort was made to persuade the independents to\r\nmake the same contracts on condition that they shipped as much oil, but\r\nthey would not hear of it. They demanded open rates, with no rebates to\r\nanyone. Horace Clark and W. H. Vanderbilt particularly stuck for this\r\narrangement. Their opposition to the oil men’s position was so strong\r\nthat the latter in reporting it to the Union said: “We feel it proper to\r\nsay that we are in no wise indebted to these gentlemen for any courtesy\r\nor consideration received at their hands.” So well did the committee\r\nfight its battle and so strongly were they supported by the New York\r\nrefiners that the railroads were finally obliged to consent to revoke\r\nthe contracts and to make a new one embodying the views of the Oil\r\nRegions. The contract finally signed at this meeting by H. F. Clark for\r\nthe Lake Shore road, O. H. P. Archer for the Erie, W. H. Vanderbilt for\r\nthe Central, George B. McClellan for the Atlantic and Great Western, and\r\nThomas A. Scott for the Pennsylvania, agreed that all shipping of oil\r\nshould be made on “a basis of perfect equality to all shippers,\r\nproducers, and refiners, and that no rebates, drawbacks, or other\r\narrangements of any character shall be made or allowed that will give\r\nany party the slightest difference in rates or discriminations of any\r\ncharacter whatever.”[24] It was also agreed that the rates should not be\r\nliable to change either for increase or decrease without first giving\r\nWilliam Hasson, president of the Producers’ Union, at least ninety days’\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe same rate was put on refined oil from Cleveland, Pittsburg and the\r\ncreek, to Eastern shipping points; that is, Mr. Rockefeller could send\r\nhis oil from Cleveland to New York at $1.50 per barrel; so could his\r\nassociates in Pittsburg; and this was what it cost the refiner on the\r\ncreek; but the latter had this advantage: he was at the wells. Mr.\r\nRockefeller and his Pittsburg allies were miles away, and it cost them,\r\nby the new contract, fifty cents to get a barrel of crude to their\r\nworks. The Oil Regions meant that geographical position should count,\r\nthat the advantages Mr. Rockefeller had by his command of the Western\r\nmarket and by his access to a cheap Eastward waterway should be\r\nconsidered as well as their own position beside the raw product.\r\n\r\nThis contract was the first effective thrust into the great bubble.\r\nOthers followed in quick succession. On the 28th the railroads\r\nofficially annulled their contracts with the company. About the same\r\ntime the Pennsylvania Legislature repealed the charter. On March 30 the\r\ncommittee of oil men sent to Washington to be present during the\r\nCongressional Investigation, now about to begin, spent an hour with\r\nPresident Grant. They wired home that on their departure he said:\r\n“Gentlemen, I have noticed the progress of monopolies, and have long\r\nbeen convinced that the national government would have to interfere and\r\nprotect the people against them.” The President and the members of\r\nCongress of both parties continued to show interest in the\r\ninvestigation, and there was little or no dissent from the final\r\njudgment of the committee, given early in May, that the South\r\nImprovement Company was the “most gigantic and daring conspiracy” a free\r\ncountry had ever seen. This decision finished the work. The “Monster”\r\nwas slain, the Oil Regions proclaimed exultantly.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the question, What should they do about the blockade\r\nestablished against the members of the South Improvement Company? The\r\nrailroads they had forgiven; should they forgive the members of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company? This question came up immediately on the\r\nrepeal of the charter. The first severe test to which their temper was\r\nput was early in April, when the Fisher Brothers, a firm of Oil City\r\nbrokers, sold some 20,000 barrels of oil to the Standard Oil Company.\r\nThe moment the sale was noised a perfect uproar burst forth. Indignant\r\ntelegrams came from every direction condemning the brokers. “Betrayal,”\r\n“infamy,” “mercenary achievement,” “the most unkindest cut of all,” was\r\nthe gist of them. From New York, Porter and Archbold telegraphed\r\nannulling all their contracts with the guilty brokers. The Oil Exchange\r\npassed votes of censure, and the Producers’ Union turned them out. A few\r\ndays later it was learned that a dealer on the creek was preparing to\r\nship 5,000 barrels to the same firm. A mob gathered about the cars and\r\nrefused to let them leave. It was only by stationing a strong guard that\r\nthe destruction of the oil was prevented.\r\n\r\nBut something had to be done. The cooler heads argued that the blockade,\r\nwhich had lasted now forty days, and from which the region had of course\r\nsuffered enormous loss, should be entirely lifted. The objects for which\r\nit had been established had been accomplished—that is, the South\r\nImprovement Company had been destroyed—now let free trade be\r\nestablished. If anybody wanted to sell to “conspirators,” it was his\r\nlookout. A long and excited meeting of men from the entire oil country\r\nwas held at Oil City to discuss the question.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Petroleum Producers’ Union, Captain William Hasson,\r\nin anticipation of the meeting, had sent to the officers of all the\r\nrailroads which had been parties to the South Improvement Company, the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OFFICE PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION,\r\n                                OIL CITY, PENNSYLVANIA, April 4, 1872.\r\n\r\n  We are informed by parties known as members of the South Improvement\r\n  Company, now representing the Standard Oil Company, who are in the\r\n  market overbidding other shippers, that all contracts between the\r\n  railroad companies and South Improvement and Standard Companies are\r\n  cancelled. Will you please give us official notice whether such\r\n  contracts are cancelled or not? The people in mass-meeting assembled\r\n  have instructed the executive committee not to sell or ship any oil\r\n  to these parties until we receive such notice. Please answer at\r\n  once, as we fear violence and destruction of property.\r\n\r\n                             Signed       WILLIAM HASSON, _President_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, Horace F. Clark, Thomas A. Scott, and W. H.\r\nVanderbilt all sent emphatic telegrams in reply, asserting that the\r\nSouth Improvement contracts had been cancelled and that their roads had\r\nno understanding of any nature in regard to freights with the Standard\r\nOil Company. “The only existing arrangement is with you,” telegraphed\r\nGeneral McClellan. W. H. Vanderbilt reminded Mr. Hasson that the\r\nagreement of March 25, between the railroad companies and the joint\r\ncommittee of producers and refiners, was on a basis of perfect equality\r\nfor all, and the inference was, how could Mr. Vanderbilt possibly make a\r\nspecial arrangement with the Standard? From the Standard Oil Company the\r\nfollowing was received:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       CLEVELAND, OHIO, April 8, 1872.\r\n\r\n  TO CAPTAIN WILLIAM HASSON: In answer to your telegram, this company\r\n  holds no contract with the railroad companies or any of them, or\r\n  with the South Improvement Company. The contracts between the South\r\n  Improvement Company and the railroads have been cancelled, and I am\r\n  informed you have been so advised by telegram. I state unqualifiedly\r\n  that reports circulated in the Oil Region and elsewhere, that this\r\n  company, or any member of it, threatened to depress oil, are false.\r\n\r\n                                     JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, _President_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reading all the telegrams the committee submitted its report. The\r\ngist of it was that since they had official assurance that the hated\r\ncontracts were cancelled, and that since they had secured from all the\r\ntrunk lines a “fair rate of freight, equal to all shippers and\r\nproducers, great or small, with an abolition of the system of rebates\r\nand drawbacks,” the time had arrived “to open the channels of trade to\r\nall parties desiring to purchase or deal in oil on terms of equality.”\r\nThe report was received with “approbation and delight” and put an\r\nofficial end to the “Oil War.”\r\n\r\nBut no number of resolutions could wipe out the memory of the forty days\r\nof terrible excitement and loss which the region had suffered. No\r\ntriumph could stifle the suspicion and the bitterness which had been\r\nsown broadcast through the region. Every particle of independent manhood\r\nin these men whose very life was independent action had been outraged.\r\nTheir sense of fair play, the saving force of the region in the days\r\nbefore law and order had been established, had been violated. These were\r\nthings which could not be forgotten. There henceforth could be no trust\r\nin those who had devised a scheme which, the producers believed, was\r\nintended to rob them of their property.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that under the pressure of their indignation and\r\nresentment some person or persons should be fixed upon as responsible,\r\nand should be hated accordingly. Before the lifting of the embargo this\r\nresponsibility had been fixed. It was the Standard Oil Company of\r\nCleveland, so the Oil Regions decided, which was at the bottom of the\r\nbusiness, and the “Mephistopheles of the Cleveland company,” as they put\r\nit, was John D. Rockefeller. Even the Cleveland Herald acknowledged this\r\npopular judgment. “Whether justly or unjustly,” the editor wrote,\r\n“Cleveland has the odium of having originated the scheme.” This opinion\r\ngained ground as the days passed. The activity of the president of the\r\nStandard in New York, in trying to save the contracts with the\r\nrailroads, and his constant appearance with Mr. Watson, and the fact\r\nbrought out by the Congressional Investigation that a larger block of\r\nthe South Improvement Company’s stock was owned in the Standard than in\r\nany other firm, strengthened the belief. But what did more than anything\r\nelse to fix the conviction was what they had learned of the career of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company in Cleveland. Before the Oil War the company\r\nhad been known simply as one of several successful firms in that city.\r\nIt drove close bargains, but it paid promptly, and was considered a\r\ndesirable customer. Now the Oil Regions learned for the first time of\r\nthe sudden and phenomenal expansion of the company. Where there had been\r\nat the beginning of 1872 twenty-six refining firms in Cleveland, there\r\nwere but six left. In three months before and during the Oil War the\r\nStandard had absorbed twenty plants. It was generally charged by the\r\nCleveland refiners that Mr. Rockefeller had used the South Improvement\r\nscheme to persuade or compel his rivals to sell to him. “Why,” cried the\r\noil men, “the Standard Oil Company has done already in Cleveland what\r\nthe South Improvement Company set out to do for the whole country, and\r\nit has done it by the same means.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the blockade was raised, another unhappy conviction was\r\nfixed on the Oil Regions—the Standard Oil Company meant to carry out the\r\nplans of the exploded South Improvement Company. The promoters of the\r\nscheme were partly responsible for the report. Under the smart of their\r\ndefeat they talked rather more freely than their policy of silence\r\njustified, and their remarks were quoted widely. Mr. Rockefeller was\r\nreported in the Derrick to have said to a prominent oil man of Oil City\r\nthat the South Improvement Company could work under the charter of the\r\nStandard Oil Company, and to have predicted that in less than two months\r\nthe gentlemen would be glad to join him. The newspapers made much of the\r\nfollowing similar story reported by a New York correspondent:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A prominent Cleveland member of what was the South Improvement\r\n  Company had said within two days: “The business _now_ will be done\r\n  by the Standard Oil Company. We have a rate of freight by water from\r\n  Cleveland to New York at seventy cents. No man in the trade shall\r\n  make a dollar this year. We purpose to manipulating the market as to\r\n  run the price of crude on the creek as low as two and a half. We\r\n  mean to show the world that the South Improvement Company was\r\n  organised for business and means business in spite of opposition.\r\n  The same thing has been said in substance by the leading\r\n  Philadelphia member.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The trade here regards the Standard Oil Company as simply taking the\r\nplace of the South Improvement Company and as being ready at any moment\r\nto make the same attempt to control the trade as its progenitors did,”\r\nsaid the New York Bulletin about the middle of April. And the Cleveland\r\nHerald discussed the situation under the heading, “South Improvement\r\nCompany _alias_ Standard Oil Company.” The effect of these reports in\r\nthe Oil Regions was most disastrous. Their open war became a kind of\r\nguerilla opposition. Those who sold oil to the Standard were ostracised,\r\nand its president was openly scorned.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Rockefeller had been an ordinary man the outburst of popular\r\ncontempt and suspicion which suddenly poured on his head would have\r\nthwarted and crushed him. But he was no ordinary man. He had the\r\npowerful imagination to see what might be done with the oil business if\r\nit could be centered in his hands—the intelligence to analyse the\r\nproblem into its elements and to find the key to control. He had the\r\nessential element of all great achievement, a steadfastness to a purpose\r\nonce conceived which nothing can crush. The Oil Regions might rage, call\r\nhim a conspirator, and all those who sold him oil, traitors; the\r\nrailroads might withdraw their contracts and the Legislature annul his\r\ncharter; undisturbed and unresting he kept at his great purpose. Even if\r\nhis nature had not been such as to forbid him to abandon an enterprise\r\nin which he saw promise of vast profits, even if he had not had a mind\r\nwhich, stopped by a wall, burrows under or creeps around, he would\r\nnevertheless have been forced to desperate efforts to keep up his\r\nbusiness. He had increased his refining capacity in Cleveland to 10,000\r\nbarrels on the strength of the South Improvement Company contracts.\r\nThese contracts were annulled, and in their place was one signed by\r\nofficials of all the oil-shipping roads refusing rebates to everybody.\r\nHis geographical position was such that it cost him under these new\r\ncontracts fifty cents more to get oil from the wells to New York than it\r\ndid his rivals on the creek. True, he had many counterbalancing\r\nadvantages—a growing Western market almost entirely in his hands, lake\r\ntraffic, close proximity to all sorts of accessories to his\r\nmanufacturing, but this contract put him on a level with his rivals. By\r\nhis size he should have better terms than they. What did he do?\r\n\r\nHe got a rebate. Seven years later Mr. Rockefeller’s partner, H. M.\r\nFlagler, was called before a commission of the Ohio State Legislature\r\nappointed to investigate railroads. He was asked for the former\r\ncontracts between his company and the railroads, and among others he\r\npresented one showing that from “the first of April until the middle of\r\nNovember, 1872,” their East-bound rate was $1.25, twenty-five cents less\r\nthan that set by the agreement of March 25th, between the oil men and\r\nthe railroads.[25] The discrepancy between the date Mr. Flagler gives\r\nfor this contract and that of Mr. Vanderbilt’s telegram to Mr. Hasson\r\nstating that his road had no contract with the Standard Oil Company,\r\nApril 6, and of Mr. Rockefeller’s own telegram stating he had no\r\ncontracts with the railroads, April 8, the writer is unable to explain.\r\nHow had Mr. Rockefeller been able to get this rebate? Simply as he had\r\nalways done—by virtue of the quantity he shipped. He was able to say to\r\nMr. Vanderbilt, I can make a contract to ship sixty car-loads of oil a\r\nday over your road—nearly 4,800 barrels; I cannot give this to you\r\nregularly unless you will make me a concession; and Mr. Vanderbilt made\r\nthe concession while he was signing the contract with the oil men. Of\r\ncourse the rate was secret, and Mr. Rockefeller probably understood now,\r\nas he had not two months before, how essential it was that he keep it\r\nsecret. His task was more difficult now, for he had an enemy active,\r\nclamorous, contemptuous, whose suspicions had reached that acute point\r\nwhere they could believe nothing but evil of him—the producers and\r\nindependent refiners of the Oil Regions. It was utterly impossible that\r\nhe should ever silence this enemy, for their points of view were\r\ndiametrically opposed.\r\n\r\nThey believed in independent effort—every man for himself and fair play\r\nfor all. They wanted competition, loved open fight. They considered that\r\nall business should be done openly; that the railways were bound as\r\npublic carriers to give equal rates; that any combination which favoured\r\none firm or one locality at the expense of another was unjust and\r\nillegal. This belief long held by many of the oil men had been\r\ncrystallised by the uprising into a common sentiment. It had become the\r\nmoral code of the region.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s point of view was different. He believed that the\r\n“good of all” was in a combination which would control the business as\r\nthe South Improvement Company proposed to control it. Such a combination\r\nwould end at once all the abuses the business suffered. As rebates and\r\nspecial rates were essential to this control, he favoured them. Of\r\ncourse Mr. Rockefeller must have known that the railroad was a common\r\ncarrier, and that the common law forbade discrimination. But he knew\r\nthat the railroads had not obeyed the laws governing them, that they had\r\nregularly granted special rates and rebates to those who had large\r\namounts of freight. That is, you were able to bargain with the railroads\r\nas you did with a man carrying on a strictly private business depending\r\nin no way on a public franchise. Moreover, Mr. Rockefeller probably\r\nbelieved that, in spite of the agreements, if he did not get rebates\r\nsomebody else would; that they were for the wariest, the shrewdest, the\r\nmost persistent. If somebody was to get rebates, why not he? This point\r\nof view was no uncommon one. Many men held it and felt a sort of scorn,\r\nas practical men always do for theorists, when it was contended that the\r\nshipper was as wrong in taking rates as the railroads in granting them.\r\n\r\nThus, on one hand there was an exaggerated sense of personal\r\nindependence, on the other a firm belief in combination; on one hand a\r\ndetermination to root out the vicious system of rebates practised by the\r\nrailway, on the other a determination to keep it alive and profit by it.\r\nThose theories which the body of oil men held as vital and fundamental\r\nMr. Rockefeller and his associates either did not comprehend or were\r\ndeaf to. This lack of comprehension by many men of what seems to other\r\nmen to be the most obvious principles of justice is not rare. Many men\r\nwho are widely known as good, share it. Mr. Rockefeller was “good.”\r\nThere was no more faithful Baptist in Cleveland than he. Every\r\nenterprise of that church he had supported liberally from his youth. He\r\ngave to its poor. He visited its sick. He wept with its suffering.\r\nMoreover, he gave unostentatiously to many outside charities of whose\r\nworthiness he was satisfied. He was simple and frugal in his habits. He\r\nnever went to the theatre, never drank wine. He gave much time to the\r\ntraining of his children, seeking to develop in them his own habits of\r\neconomy and of charity. Yet he was willing to strain every nerve to\r\nobtain for himself special and unjust privileges from the railroads\r\nwhich were bound to ruin every man in the oil business not sharing them\r\nwith him. He was willing to array himself against the combined better\r\nsentiment of a whole industry, to oppose a popular movement aimed at\r\nrighting an injustice, so revolting to one’s sense of fair play as that\r\nof railroad discriminations. Religious emotion and sentiments of\r\ncharity, propriety and self-denial seem to have taken the place in him\r\nof notions of justice and regard for the rights of others.\r\n\r\nUnhampered, then, by any ethical consideration, undismayed by the\r\nclamour of the Oil Regions, believing firmly as ever that relief for the\r\ndisorders in the oil business lay in combining and controlling the\r\nentire refining interest, this man of vast patience and foresight took\r\nup his work. That work now was to carry out some kind of a scheme which\r\nwould limit the output of refined oil. He had put his competitors in\r\nCleveland out of the way. He had secured special privileges in\r\ntransportation, but there were still too many refineries at work to make\r\nit possible to put up the price of oil four cents a gallon. It was\r\ncertain, too, that no scheme could be worked to do that unless the Oil\r\nRegions could be mollified. That now was Mr. Rockefeller’s most\r\nimportant business. Just how he began is not known. It is only certain\r\nthat the day after the newspapers of the Oil Regions printed the report\r\nof the Congressional Committee on Commerce denouncing the South\r\nImprovement Company as “one of the most gigantic and dangerous\r\nconspiracies ever attempted,” and declaring that if it had not been\r\nchecked in time it “would have resulted in the absorption and arbitrary\r\ncontrol of trade in all the great interests of the country.”[26] Mr.\r\nRockefeller and several other members of the South Improvement Company\r\nappeared in the Oil Regions. They had come, they explained, to present a\r\nnew plan of co-operation, and to show the oil men that it was to their\r\ninterest to go into it. Whether they would be able to obtain by\r\npersuasion what they had failed to obtain by assault was now an\r\ninteresting uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER FOUR\r\n                          “AN UNHOLY ALLIANCE”\r\n\r\n  ROCKEFELLER AND HIS PARTY NOW PROPOSE AN OPEN INSTEAD OF A SECRET\r\n    COMBINATION—“THE PITTSBURG PLAN”—THE SCHEME IS NOT APPROVED BY THE\r\n    OIL REGIONS BECAUSE ITS CHIEF STRENGTH IS THE REBATE—ROCKEFELLER NOT\r\n    DISCOURAGED—THREE MONTHS LATER BECOMES PRESIDENT OF NATIONAL\r\n    REFINERS’ ASSOCIATION—FOUR-FIFTHS OF REFINING INTEREST OF UNITED\r\n    STATES WITH HIM—OIL REGIONS AROUSED—PRODUCERS’ UNION ORDER DRILLING\r\n    STOPPED AND A THIRTY DAY SHUT-DOWN TO COUNTERACT FALLING PRICE OF\r\n    CRUDE—PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ AGENCY FORMED TO ENABLE PRODUCERS TO\r\n    CONTROL THEIR OWN OIL—ROCKEFELLER OUTGENERALS HIS OPPONENTS AND\r\n    FORCES A COMBINATION OF REFINERS AND PRODUCERS—PRODUCERS’\r\n    ASSOCIATION AND PRODUCERS’ AGENCY SNUFFED OUT—NATIONAL REFINERS’\r\n    ASSOCIATION DISBANDS—ROCKEFELLER STEADILY GAINING GROUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feeling of outrage and resentment against the Standard Oil Company,\r\ngeneral in the Oil Regions at the close of the Oil War because of the\r\nbelief that it intended to carry on the South Improvement Company in\r\nsome new way, was intensified in the weeks immediately following the\r\noutbreak by the knowledge that Mr. Rockefeller had been so enormously\r\nbenefited by the short-lived concern. Here he was shipping Eastward over\r\none road between 4,000 and 5,000 barrels of refined oil a day—oil wrung\r\nfrom his neighbours by an outrageous conspiracy, men said bitterly. This\r\nfeeling was still keen when Mr. Rockefeller and several of his\r\ncolleagues in the South Improvement scheme suddenly, in May, 1873,\r\nappeared on the streets of Titusville. The men who had fought him so\r\ndesperately now stared in amazement at the smiling, unruffled\r\ncountenance with which he greeted them. Did not the man know when he was\r\nbeaten? Did he not realise the opinion the Oil Regions held of him? His\r\nplacid demeanour in the very teeth of their violence was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nNot less of a shock was given the country by the knowledge that Mr.\r\nRockefeller, Mr. Flagler, Mr. Waring and the other gentlemen in their\r\nparty were pressing a new alliance, and that they claimed that their new\r\nscheme had none of the obnoxious features of the defunct South\r\nImprovement Company, though it was equally well adapted to work out the\r\n“good of the oil business.”\r\n\r\nFor several days the visiting gentlemen slipped around, bland and\r\nsmiling, from street corner to street corner, from office to office,\r\nexplaining, expostulating, mollifying. “You misunderstand our\r\nintention,” they told the refiners. “It is to save the business, not to\r\ndestroy it, that we are come. You see the disorders competition has\r\nwrought in the oil industry. Let us see what combination will do. Let us\r\nmake an experiment—that is all. If it does not work, then we can go back\r\nto the old method.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Rockefeller was everywhere, and heard everything in these\r\ndays, he rarely talked. “I remember well how little he said,” one of the\r\nmost aggressively independent of the Titusville refiners told the\r\nwriter. “One day several of us met at the office of one of the refiners,\r\nwho, I felt pretty sure, was being persuaded to go into the scheme which\r\nthey were talking up. Everybody talked except Mr. Rockefeller. He sat in\r\na rocking-chair, softly swinging back and forth, his hands over his\r\nface. I got pretty excited when I saw how those South Improvement men\r\nwere pulling the wool over our men’s eyes, and making them believe we\r\nwere all going to the dogs if there wasn’t an immediate combination to\r\nput up the price of refined and prevent new people coming into the\r\nbusiness, and I made a speech which, I guess, was pretty warlike. Well,\r\nright in the middle of it John Rockefeller stopped rocking and took down\r\nhis hands and looked at me. You never saw such eyes. He took me all in,\r\nsaw just how much fight he could expect from me, and I knew it, and then\r\nup went his hands and back and forth went his chair.”\r\n\r\nFor fully a week this quiet circulation among the oil men went on, and\r\nthen, on May 15 and 16, public meetings were held in Titusville, at\r\nwhich the new scheme which they had been advocating was presented\r\npublicly. This new plan, called the “Pittsburg Plan”[27] from the place\r\nof its birth, had been worked out by the visiting gentlemen before they\r\ncame to the Oil Regions. It was a most intelligent and comprehensive\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the South Improvement scheme, a company was to be\r\nformed to run the refining business of the whole country, but this\r\ncompany was to be an open instead of a secret organisation, and all\r\nrefiners were to be allowed to become stockholders in it. The owners of\r\nthe refineries who went into the combination were then to run them in\r\ncertain particulars according to the direction of the board of the\r\nparent company; that is, they were to refine only such an amount of oil\r\nas the board allowed, and they were to keep up the price for their\r\noutput as the board indicated. The buying of crude oil and the\r\narrangements for transportation were also to remain with the directors.\r\nEach stockholder was to receive dividends whether his plant operated or\r\nnot. The “Pittsburg Plan” was presented tentatively. If anything better\r\ncould be suggested they would gladly accept it, its advocates said. “All\r\nwe want is a practical combination. We are wed to no particular form.”\r\n\r\nThe first revelation of the public meetings at which the “Pittsburg\r\nPlan” was presented was that in the days Mr. Rockefeller and his friends\r\nhad been so diligently shaking hands with the oil men from Titusville to\r\nOil City they had made converts—that they had not entered these open\r\nmeetings until they had secured the assurance of co-operation in any\r\nplan of consolidation which might be effected from some of the ablest\r\nrefiners and business men of the creek, notably from J. J. Vandergrift\r\nof Oil City, and from certain firms of Titusville with which John D.\r\nArchbold was connected. All of these persons had fought the South\r\nImprovement Company, and they all now declared that if the proposed\r\norganisation copied that piratical scheme they would have nothing to do\r\nwith it, that their allegiance to the plan was based on their conviction\r\nthat it was fair to all—who went in!—and that it was made necessary by\r\nover-refining, underselling, and by the certainty that the railroads\r\ncould not be trusted to keep their contracts. It was evident that the\r\npossible profits and power to be gained by a successful combination had\r\nwiped out their resentment against the leaders of the South Improvement\r\nCompany, and that if they had the assurance, as they must have had, that\r\nrebates were a part of the game, they justified themselves by the\r\nreflection that somebody was sure to get them, and that it might as well\r\nbe they as anybody.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that a considerable body of the creek refiners had gone\r\nover to Mr. Rockefeller awakened a general bitterness among those who\r\nremained independent. “Deserters,” “ringsters,” “monopolists,” were the\r\nterms applied to them, and the temper of the public meetings, as is\r\nevident from the full reports the newspapers of the Oil Region\r\npublished, became at once uncertain. There were long pauses in the\r\nproceedings, everybody fearing to speak. Mr. Rockefeller is not reported\r\nas having spoken at all, the brunt of defense and explanation having\r\nfallen on Mr. Flagler, Mr. Frew and Mr. Waring. Two or three times the\r\nconvention wrangled to the point of explosion, and one important\r\nrefiner, M. N. Allen, who was also the editor of the Titusville Courier,\r\none of the best papers in the region, took his hat and left. Before the\r\nend of the convention the supporters of combination ought to have felt,\r\nif they did not, that they had been a little too eager in pressing an\r\nalliance on the Oil Regions so soon after outraging its moral sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe press and people were making it plain enough, indeed, that they did\r\nnot trust the persuasive advocates of reform. On every street corner and\r\non every railroad train men reckoned the percentage of interest the\r\nstockholders of the South Improvement Company would have in the new\r\ncombination. It was too great. But what stirred the Oil Region most\r\ndeeply was its conviction that the rebate system was regarded as the\r\nkeystone of the new plan. “What are you going to do with the men who\r\nprefer to run their own business?” asked a representative of the Oil\r\nCity Derrick of one of the advocates of the plan. “Go through them,” was\r\nreported to be his laconic reply. “But how?” “By the co-operation of\r\ntransportation”—that is, by rebates. Now the Oil Region had been too\r\nrecently convicted of the sin of the rebate, and had taken too firm a\r\ndetermination to uproot the iniquitous practice to be willing to ally\r\nitself with any combination which it suspected of accepting privileges\r\nwhich its neighbours could not get or would not take.\r\n\r\nAt the very time the association of refiners was under consideration an\r\nattempt was made to win over the producers by offering, through their\r\nunion, to buy all their oil at five dollars a barrel for five years. Oil\r\nwas four dollars at the time. The producers refused. Such an agreement\r\ncould only be kept, they said, by an association which was an absolute\r\nmonopoly, fixing prices of refined to satisfy its own greed. All they\r\nwanted of the producer was to be a party to their conspiracy. When they\r\nhad destroyed his moral force and completed their monopoly they would\r\npay him what they pleased for oil, and the price would not be five\r\ndollars! What could he do then? He would be their slave, there would be\r\nno other buyer—could be none, since they would control the entire\r\ntransportation system.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the negotiations was that again the advocates of\r\ncombination had to retire from the Oil Regions defeated. “_Sic semper\r\ntyrannis, sic transit gloria_ South Improvement Company,” sneered the\r\nOil City Derrick, which was given to sprinkling Latin phrases into its\r\nforceful and picturesque English. But the Derrick underrated both the\r\nman and the principle at which it sneered. A great idea was at work in\r\nthe commercial world. It had come to them saddled with crime. They now\r\nsaw nothing in it but the crime. The man who had brought it to them was\r\nnot only endowed with far vision, he was endowed with an indomitable\r\npurpose. He meant to control the oil business. By one manœuvre, and that\r\na discredited one, he had obtained control of one-fifth of the entire\r\nrefining output of the United States. He meant to secure the other\r\nfour-fifths. He might retire now, but the Oil Region would hear of him\r\nagain. It did. Three months later, in August, 1872, it was learned that\r\nthe scheme of consolidation which had been presented in vain at\r\nTitusville in May had been quietly carried out, that four-fifths of the\r\nrefining interest of the United States, including many of the creek\r\nrefiners, had gone into a National Refiners’ Association, of which Mr.\r\nRockefeller was president, and one of their own men, J. J. Vandergrift,\r\nwas vice-president. The news aroused much resentment in the Oil Regions.\r\nThe region was no longer solid in its free-trade sentiment, no longer\r\nundividedly true to its vow that the rebate system as applied to the oil\r\ntrade must end. There was an enemy at home. The hard words which for\r\nmonths men had heaped on the distant heads of Cleveland and Pittsburg\r\nrefiners, they began to pour out, more discreetly to be sure, on the\r\nheads of their neighbours. It boded ill for the interior peace of the\r\nOil Regions.\r\n\r\nThe news that the refiners had actually consolidated aroused something\r\nmore than resentment. The producers generally were alarmed. If the\r\naggregation succeeded they would have one buyer only for their product,\r\nand there was not a man of them who believed that this buyer would ever\r\npay them a cent more than necessary for their oil. Their alarm aroused\r\nthem to energy. The association which had scattered the South\r\nImprovement Company was revived, and began at once to consider what it\r\ncould do to prevent the consolidated refiners getting the upper hand in\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\nThe association which now prepared to contest the mastery of the oil\r\nbusiness with Mr. Rockefeller and those who had joined him was a curious\r\nand a remarkable body. Its membership, drawn from the length and breadth\r\nof the Oil Regions, included men whose production was thousands of\r\nbarrels a day and men who were pumping scarcely ten barrels; it included\r\ncollege-bred men who had come from the East with comfortable sums to\r\ninvest, and men who signed their names with an effort, had never read a\r\nbook in their lives, and whose first wells they had themselves “kicked\r\ndown.” There were producers in it who had made and lost a half-dozen\r\nfortunes, and who were, apparently, just as buoyant and hopeful as when\r\nthey began. There were those who had never put down a dry well, and were\r\nstill unsatisfied.

Now member of the\r\n    Standard Oil Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe president of the association was Captain William Hasson, a young man\r\nboth by his knowledge of the Oil Regions and the oil business well\r\nfitted for the position. Captain Hasson was one of the few men in the\r\nassociation who had been in the country before the discovery of oil. His\r\nfather had bought, in the fifties, part of the grant of land at the\r\nmouth of Oil Creek, made in 1796 to the Indian chief Cornplanter, and\r\nhad moved on it with his family. Four years after the discovery of oil\r\nhe and his partner disposed of 300 acres of the tract they owned for\r\n$750,000. Young Hasson had seen Cornplanter, as the site of his father’s\r\nfarm was called, become Oil City; he had seen the mill, blacksmith shop\r\nand country tavern give way to a thriving town of several thousand\r\ninhabitants. All of his interests and his pride were wrapped up in the\r\nindustry which had grown up about him. Independent in spirit, vigorous\r\nin speech, generous and just in character, William Hasson had been\r\nthoroughly aroused by the assault of the South Improvement Company, and\r\nunder his presidency the producers had conducted their successful\r\ncampaign. The knowledge that the same man who had been active in that\r\nscheme had now organised a national association had convinced Captain\r\nHasson of the necessity of a counter move, and he threw himself\r\nenergetically into an effort to persuade the oil producers to devise an\r\nintelligent and practical plan for controlling their end of the\r\nbusiness, and then stand by what they decided on.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hasson and those who were working with him would have had a much\r\nmore difficult task in arousing the producers to action if it had not\r\nbeen for the general dissatisfaction over the price of oil. The average\r\nprice of crude in the month of August, 1872, was $3.47½. The year before\r\nit had been $4.42½, and that was considered a poverty price. It was\r\npretty certain that prices would fall still lower, that “three-dollar\r\noil” was near at hand. Everybody declared three dollars was not a\r\n“living price” for oil, that it cost more than that to produce it. The\r\naverage yield of the wells in the Oil Region in 1872 was five barrels a\r\nday. Now a well cost at that time from $2,500 to $8,000, exclusive of\r\nthe price of the lease. It cost eight to ten dollars a day to pump a\r\nwell, exclusive of the royalty interest—that is, the proportion of the\r\nproduction turned over to the land-owner, usually one-fourth.[28] If a\r\nman had big wells, and many of them, he made big profits on\r\n“three-dollar oil,” but there were comparatively few “big producers.”\r\nThe majority of those in the business had but few wells, and these\r\nyielded only small amounts.\r\n\r\nIf he had been contented to economise and to accept small gains, even\r\nthe small producer could live on a much lower price than three dollars;\r\nbut nobody in the Oil Regions in 1872 looked with favour on economy, and\r\neverybody despised small things. The oil men as a class had been brought\r\nup to enormous profits, and held an entirely false standard of values.\r\nAs the Derrick told them once in a sensible editorial, “their business\r\nwas born in a balloon going up, and spent all its early years in the\r\nsky.” They had seen nothing but the extreme of fortune. One hundred per\r\ncent. per annum on an investment was in their judgment only a fair\r\nprofit. If their oil property had not paid for itself entirely in six\r\nmonths, and begun to yield a good percentage, they were inclined to\r\nthink it a failure. Now nothing but five-dollar oil would do this, so\r\ngreat were the risks in business; and so it was for five-dollar oil,\r\nregardless of the laws of supply and demand, that they struggled. They\r\nwere notoriously extravagant in the management of their business. Rarely\r\ndid an oil man write a letter if he could help it. He used the telegraph\r\ninstead. Whole sets of drilling tools were sometimes sent by express. It\r\nwas no uncommon thing to see near a derrick broken tools which could\r\neasily have been mended, but which the owner had replaced by new ones.\r\nIt was anything to save bother with him. Frequently wells were abandoned\r\nwhich might have been pumped on a small but sure profit. In those days\r\nthere were men who looked on a ten-barrel (net) well as hardly worth\r\ntaking care of. And yet even at fifty cents a barrel such a well would\r\nhave paid the owner $1,800 a year. The simple fact was that the profits\r\nwhich men in trades all over the country were glad enough to get, the\r\noil producer despised. The one great thing which the Oil Regions did not\r\nunderstand in 1872 was economy. As a matter of fact the oil-producing\r\nbusiness was going through a stage in its natural development similar to\r\noil refining. Both, under the stimulus of the enormous profits in the\r\nyears immediately following the discovery of oil, had been pushed until\r\nthey had outstripped consumption. The competition resulting from the\r\ninrush of producers and refiners and the economies which had been worked\r\nout were bringing down profits. The combinations attempted by both\r\nrefiners and producers in these years were really efforts to keep up\r\nprices to the extravagant point of the early speculative years.\r\n\r\nNow the drop in the price of oil everybody recognised to be due to a\r\nnatural cause. Where a year before the production had been 12,000\r\nbarrels a day, it was now 16,000. The demand for refined had not\r\nincreased in proportion to this production of crude, and oil stocks had\r\naccumulated until the tanks of the region were threatening to overflow.\r\nAnd there was no sign of falling off. Under these circumstances it\r\nneeded little argument to convince the oil men that if they were to get\r\na better price they must produce no more than the world would use. There\r\nwas but one way to effect this—to put down no new wells until the stocks\r\non hand were reduced and the daily production was brought down to a\r\nmarketable amount.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the Producers’ Association an agitation at once\r\nbegan in favour of stopping the drill for six months. It was a drastic\r\nmeasure. There was hardly an oil operator in the entire region who had\r\nnot on hand some piece of territory on which he was planning to drill,\r\nor on which he had not wells under way. Stopping the drill meant that\r\nall of the aggressive work of his business should cease for six months.\r\nIt meant that his production, unreplenished, would gradually fall off,\r\nuntil at the end of the period he would have probably not over half of\r\nwhat he had now; that then he must begin over again to build up. It\r\nmeant, too, that he was at the mercy of neighbours who might refuse to\r\njoin the movement, and who by continuing to drill would drain his\r\nterritory. It seemed to him the only way of obtaining a manageable\r\noutput of crude, however, and accordingly, when late in the month of\r\nAugust the following pledge to stop the drill was circulated, the great\r\nmajority of the producers signed it:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, The extreme low price of oil requires of producers that\r\n  operations therefor shall cease for the present: Now we, the\r\n  producers, land-owners and others, residents of the Pennsylvania Oil\r\n  Region, do hereby bind ourselves to each other not to commence the\r\n  drilling of any more wells for the period of six months from the\r\n  first day of September next, not to lease any lands owned or\r\n  controlled by us for the purpose of operations during the same\r\n  period, and we also agree to use all honourable means to prevent\r\n  others from boring. This we agree to, and bind ourselves to each\r\n  other under a forfeiture of $2,000 for each well commenced by either\r\n  of us within the period above limited—the same to be collected as\r\n  any other debt. It is, however, understood by the undersigned that\r\n  this forfeiture is not to apply to any wells where the erection of\r\n  rigs is completed or under way, or that may be commenced before the\r\n  first day of September aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to this pledge came from land-owners in Clarion\r\nCounty. They were the “original settlers,” plodding Dutch farmers, whose\r\nlives had always been poor and hard and shut-in. The finding of oil had\r\nmade them rich and greedy. They were so ignorant that it was difficult\r\nto transact business of any nature with them. It was not unusual for a\r\nClarion County farmer, if offered an eighth royalty, to refuse it on the\r\nground that it was too little, and to ask a tenth. A story used to be\r\ncurrent in the Oil Regions of a producer who, returning from an\r\nunsuccessful land hunt in Clarion County was asked why he had not\r\nsecured a certain lease. “Well,” he said, “farmers wanted seven-eighths\r\nof the oil as a royalty, wanted me to furnish barrels and to paint\r\n_both_ heads. I agreed to everything but the last. I could afford to\r\npaint but one head, and so he wouldn’t sign the lease.” When the\r\nproposition to stop the drill for six months was brought to these men,\r\nwho at the time owned the richest territory in the oil field, no amount\r\nof explanation could make them understand it. They regarded it simply as\r\na scheme to rob them, and would not sign. Outside of this district,\r\nhowever, the drill stopped over nearly all the field on the first of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing but public opinion to hold the producers to their\r\npledge. But public opinion in those days in the Oil Regions was fearless\r\nand active and asserted itself in the daily newspapers and in every\r\nmeeting of the association. The whole body of oil men became a vigilance\r\ncommittee intent on keeping one another loyal to the pledge. Men who\r\nappeared at church on Sunday in silk hats, carrying gold-headed\r\ncanes—there were such in the Oil Region in 1872—now stole out at night\r\nto remote localities to hunt down rumours of drilling wells. If they\r\nfound them true, their dignity did not prevent their cutting the tools\r\nloose or carrying off a band wheel.\r\n\r\nStopping the drill afforded no immediate relief to the producers. It was\r\nfor the future. And as soon as the Petroleum Producers’ Association had\r\nthe movement well under way, it proposed another drastic measure—a\r\nthirty days’ shut-down—by which it was meant that all wells should cease\r\npumping for a month. Nothing shows better the compact organisation and\r\nthe determination of the oil producers at this time than the immediate\r\nresponse they gave to this suggestion. In ten days scarcely a barrel of\r\noil was being pumped from end to end of the Oil Regions. “That a\r\nbusiness producing three million dollars a month, employing 10,000\r\nlabouring men and fifty million dollars of capital, should be entirely\r\nsuspended, dried up, stopped still as death by a mutual voluntary\r\nagreement, made and perfected by all parties interested, within a space\r\nof ten days—this is a statement that staggers belief—a spectacle that\r\ntakes one’s breath away,” cried the Derrick, which was using all its\r\nwits to persuade the producers to limit their production. It was\r\ncertainly a spectacle which saddened the heart, however much one might\r\napplaud the grim resolution of the men who were carrying it out. The\r\ncrowded oil farms where creaking walking-beams sawed the air from\r\nmorning until night, where engines puffed, whistles screamed, great gas\r\njets flared, teams came and went, and men hurried to and fro, became\r\nsuddenly silent and desolate, and this desolation had an ugliness all\r\nits own—something unparalleled in any other industry of this country.\r\nThe awkward derricks, staring cheap shanties, big tanks with miles and\r\nmiles of pipe running hither and thither, the oil-soaked ground,\r\nblackened and ruined trees, terrible roads—all of the common features of\r\nthe oil farm to which activity gave meaning and dignity—now became\r\nhideous in inactivity. Oil seemed a curse to many a man in those days as\r\nhe stood by his silent wells and wondered what was to become of his\r\nbusiness, of his family, in this clash of interests.\r\n\r\nWhile the producers were inaugurating these movements, Captain Hasson\r\nand a committee were busy making out the plan of the permanent\r\nassociation which was to control the business of oil-producing and\r\nprevent its becoming the slave of the refining interest. The knowledge\r\nthat such an organisation was being worked out kept the oil country in a\r\nferment. In every district suggestions, practical and impractical, wise\r\nand foolish, occupied every producers’ meeting and kept the idle oil men\r\ndiscussing from morning until night. At one mass-meeting the following\r\nresolution was actually passed by a body of revengeful producers:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, that to give a wider market throughout the world to\r\n  petroleum, to enhance its price and to protect producers from unjust\r\n  combinations of home refiners, a committee be appointed to ask the\r\n  representatives of foreign governments at Washington to request\r\n  their respective governments to put a proper tariff on refined oil\r\n  and to admit crude oil free into the ports of their respective\r\n  governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the end of October Captain Hasson presented the scheme which he\r\nand the committee had prepared. It proposed that there should be\r\nestablished what was called a Petroleum Producers’ Agency.[29] This\r\nagency was really an incorporated company with a capital of one million\r\ndollars, the stock of which was to be subscribed to only by the\r\nproducers or their friends. This agency was to purchase all the oil of\r\nthe members of the association at at least five dollars a barrel. If\r\nstocks could be kept down so that the market took all of the oil at\r\nonce, the full price was to be paid at once in cash; if not, the agency\r\nwas to store the oil in tanks it was to build, and a portion of the\r\nprice was to be paid in tank certificates. By thus controlling all the\r\noil, the agency expected to protect the weakest as well as the strongest\r\nproducer, to equalise the interest of different localities, to prevent\r\nrefiners and exporters from accumulating stocks, and to prevent gambling\r\nin oil. The agency was to take active means to collect reliable\r\ninformation about the oil business—the number of wells drilling, the\r\nactual production, the stocks on hand—things which had never been done\r\nto anybody’s satisfaction. Indeed, one of the standing causes for\r\nquarrels between the various newspapers of the region was their\r\nconflicting statistics about production and stocks. It was to make a\r\nstudy of the market and see what could be done to increase consumption.\r\nIt was to oppose monopolies and encourage competition, and, if\r\nnecessary, it was to provide co-operative refineries which the producers\r\nshould own and control.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the agency, as explained by Captain Hasson, was most\r\nliberal, considering the interests of even the drillers and pumpers.\r\n“Advise every employee to take at least one share of stock for himself,”\r\nhe said in his address, “and one for his wife and each of his children,\r\nand encourage him to pay for it out of his saved earnings or out of his\r\nmonthly pay. If he is not able to keep up his instalments, assure him\r\nthat you will help him, and then take care to do it. You will thus do\r\nhim a double kindness, and benefit his family by encouraging habits of\r\nthrift and economy. You owe this much to him who so nobly seconded your\r\nefforts to gain control of the market by stopping work. You had all to\r\ngain, and he had nothing to hope for but your benefit. Now show your\r\nappreciation of his acts by this evidence of your regard for his\r\nwelfare.”\r\n\r\nThe plan was received with general enthusiasm, and when it came up for\r\nadoption it went through with a veritable whoop. Indeed, within a few\r\nmoments after its official acceptance, which took place in Oil City on\r\nOctober 24, $200,000 worth of stock was taken, and less than two weeks\r\nlater it was announced that more than the desired million dollars had\r\nbeen subscribed, that the trustees and officers had been elected, and\r\nthat the agency was ready for work. For the first time in the history of\r\nthe oil business the producers were united in an organisation, which, if\r\ncarried out, would regulate the production of oil to something like the\r\ndemand for it, would prevent stocks from falling into the hands of\r\nspeculators, and would provide a strong front to any combination with\r\nmonopolistic tendencies. Only one thing was necessary now to make the\r\nproducer a fitting opponent to his natural enemy, the refiner. That\r\nthing was loyalty to the agency he had established. The future of the\r\nproducer at that moment was in his own hand. Would he stick? By every\r\nsign he would. He thought so himself. He had acted so resolutely and\r\nintelligently up to this point that even Mr. Rockefeller seems to have\r\nthought so.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire three months that the producers had been organising,\r\nthe refiners had been making divers overtures to them. In August several\r\nof the refiners sought certain of the big producers and privately\r\nproposed a two-headed combination which should handle the whole\r\nbusiness, from drilling to exportation. The proposition they made was\r\nmost alluring to men suffering from low prices. “Carry out your plans to\r\nlimit your production and guarantee to sell only to us,” said Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s representative, “and we will give you four dollars a\r\nbarrel for your oil. We will also establish a sliding scale, and for\r\nevery cent a gallon that refined oil advances we will give you\r\ntwenty-five cents more on your barrel of crude.” The market price of\r\ncrude oil, when this offer was made, was hovering around three dollars.\r\n“How,” asked the producer, “can you do this?” “We expect, by means of\r\nour combination, to get a rebate of seventy-five cents a barrel,” was\r\nthe answer. “But the railroads have signed an agreement to give no\r\nrebates,” objected the producers.\r\n\r\n“As if the railroads ever kept an agreement,” answered the worldly-wise\r\nrefiners. “Somebody will get the rebates. It is the way the railroads do\r\nbusiness. If it is to be anybody, we propose it shall be our\r\ncombination.” Now it was clear enough to the men approached that the\r\ngreat body of their association would never go into any scheme based on\r\nrebates, and they said so. The refiners saw no disadvantage in that\r\nfact. “We don’t want _all_ the producers. We only want the big ones. The\r\nsmall producer under our arrangement must die, as the small refiner\r\nmust.” The proposition never got beyond the conference chamber. It was\r\ntoo cynical. Several conferences of the same nature took place later\r\nbetween representatives of the two interests, but nothing came of them.\r\nThe two associations were kept apart by the natural antagonism of their\r\nideals and their policy. Captain Hasson and his followers were working\r\non an organisation which aimed to protect the weakest as well as the\r\nstrongest; which welcomed everybody who cared to come into the business;\r\nwhich encouraged competition and discountenanced any sort of special\r\nprivilege. Mr. Rockefeller and his associates proposed to save the\r\nstrong and eliminate the weak, to limit the membership to those who came\r\nin now, to prevent competition by securing exclusive privileges. Their\r\nprogram was cold-blooded, but it must be confessed that it showed a much\r\nfirmer grasp on the commercial practices of the day, and a much deeper\r\nknowledge of human nature as it operates in business, than that of the\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Producers’ Agency brought the refiners back to the\r\nOil Regions in greater earnest than ever. The success of that\r\norganisation gave them an active antagonist, one which, as it held the\r\nraw material, could at any time actually shut up their refineries by\r\nwithholding oil. The vigour, the ability, the determination the new\r\norganisation had displayed made it a serious threat to the domination\r\nMr. Rockefeller and his associates had dreamed. It must be placated. On\r\nNovember 8, immediately after it was announced that the entire million\r\ndollars’ worth of stock was taken, an agent of the Standard Oil Company\r\nin Oil City was ordered to buy oil from the agency—6,000 barrels of oil\r\nat $4.75 a barrel—and the order was followed by this telegram from Mr.\r\nRockefeller:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “It has been represented to us that if we would buy of the\r\n  producers’ agent at Oil City and pay $4.75 per barrel, they would\r\n  maintain the price. We are willing to go farther and buy only of the\r\n  producers’ agent, hence the order we have given you. See Hasson and\r\n  others and let there be a fair understanding on this point. We will\r\n  do all in our power to maintain prices, and continue to buy,\r\n  provided our position is fully understood. We do this to convince\r\n  producers of our sincerity, and to assist in establishing the\r\n  market.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA more adroit move could not have been made at this moment. This\r\npurchase was a demonstration that the Refiners’ Association could and\r\nwould pay the price the producers asked; that they asked nothing better,\r\nin fact, than to ally themselves with the agency. The events of the next\r\nthree weeks, on the contrary, showed the agency that it would be some\r\ntime before anybody else would pay them any such price as that Mr.\r\nRockefeller promised. The reason was evident enough. In spite of the\r\nstopping of the drill, in spite of the thirty days’ shut-down,\r\nproduction was increasing. Indeed, the runs[30] for November were\r\ngreater than they had ever been in any single month since the beginning\r\nof the oil business. A large number of wells under way when the drill\r\nwas stopped had “come in big.” New territory had been opened up by\r\nunexpected wildcats. The shut-down had done less than was expected to\r\ndecrease stocks. It was evident that the Producers’ Association had a\r\nlong and severe task before it to bring the crude output down to\r\nanything like the demand. Could the great body of producers be depended\r\nupon to take still further measures to lessen their production, and at\r\nthe same time would they hold their oil until the agency had the mastery\r\nof the situation? Their tanks were overflowing. Many of them were in\r\ndebt and depending on their sales to meet their obligations—even to meet\r\ntheir daily personal expenses. It was little wonder that they grew\r\nrestive as they began to realise that the agency in which they had seen\r\nimmediate salvation from all their ills could only be made effective by\r\nmonths more of self-sacrifice, of agitation, of persistent effort from\r\nevery man of them. With every day they became more impatient of the\r\nbonds the agency had set for them, and the leaders soon realised that\r\nsome immediate tangible results must be given the mass of oil men, or\r\nthere was danger of a stampede.\r\n\r\nA strong feature of the genius of John D. Rockefeller has always been\r\nhis recognition of the critical moment for action in complicated\r\nsituations. He saw it now, and his representatives again came to the\r\ncreek seeking an alliance. Their arguments, as they found their way from\r\nthe private meetings into the press and the street, ran something like\r\nthis: “Our combination is the only big buyer. We are in the thing to\r\nstay, and shall remain the only big buyer. You might erect refineries\r\nand oppose us, but it would take months, and while you are waiting how\r\nare you going to hold the producers? You cannot do it. We can easily get\r\nall the oil we want to-day at our own price from the men who sell from\r\nnecessity, and yet your agency is in the first flush of enthusiasm. Sell\r\nonly to us and we will buy 15,000 barrels a day from you. Refuse an\r\nalliance with us and you will fail.”\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by the length and severity of the struggle before them if\r\nthey insisted on independence, fearful lest the scattered and restless\r\nproducers could not be held much longer, convinced by their confident\r\narguments that the refiners could keep their promise, the council\r\nfinally agreed to a plan of union which the Derrick dubbed the “Treaty\r\nof Titusville.” A terrible hubbub followed the announcement that a\r\ntreaty was proposed and would probably be adopted by the association.\r\nThe same old arguments which had greeted each overture from the refiners\r\nwere gone over again. It would be a monopoly. The price they offered for\r\ncrude depended upon their getting an unnaturally high price for refined.\r\nThe markets of the world would refuse to pay this price when it was\r\ndiscovered that it was kept up by an agreement which was contrary to the\r\nlaws of supply and demand. And, besides, the parties could not trust\r\neach other. “_Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes._” Liberal translation—“Mind\r\nyour eye when the Cleveland refiners get generous,” cautioned the\r\nDerrick. As always, the ghost of the South Improvement Company was\r\nbetween them. On the other hand, it was argued that it was Hobson’s\r\nchoice, “combine or bust,” there is no other market. We cannot wait for\r\none. We have a million barrels of oil on hand—the refiners will take\r\n15,000 barrels a day for “spot cash.” And after all, concluded the\r\n“philosophical,” if you can’t do as well as you want to, do the best you\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES S.

ABBOTT\r\n\r\n  One of the most prominent of the early oil producers, refiners and\r\n    pipe-line operators.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn December 12 the proposed treaty was laid before the producers at Oil\r\nCity. It aroused a debate so acrimonious that even the Derrick\r\nsuppressed it. Captain Hasson led the opposition. In his judgment there\r\nwas but one course for the producers—to keep themselves free from all\r\nentanglements and give themselves time to build up solidly the structure\r\nthey had planned. If they had followed his advice the whole history of\r\nthe Oil Regions would have been different. But they did not follow it.\r\nThe treaty was ratified by a vote of twenty-seven to seven. The\r\nexcitement and the personalities the association indulged in at their\r\nmeeting augured ill for its future, but when a week later a committee\r\nsent to see the refiners came back from New York with a contract signed\r\nby Mr. Rockefeller,[31] the president, and bearing with them an order\r\nfor 200,000 barrels of oil at $3.25, there was a general feeling that,\r\nafter all, an alliance might not be so bad a thing. 200,000 barrels was\r\na big order and would do much to relieve their distress. Their formal\r\nsense was quieted, too, by the assurance that the producers before\r\nsigning the contract had insisted that the Refiners’ Combination enter\r\ninto an agreement to take no rebates as long as the alliance lasted. The\r\nmain points of the agreement decided upon were that the Refiners’\r\nAssociation should admit all _existing_ refiners to its society, and the\r\nProducers’ Association _all_ producers present and to come—that the\r\nformer company should buy only of the latter, the latter sell only to\r\nthe former, and that the agency should bind all producers enjoying its\r\nprivileges to handle their oil through it. The refiners were to buy such\r\ndaily quantities as the markets of the world would take and at a price\r\ngoverned by the price of refined, five dollars per barrel when refined\r\nwas selling at twenty-six cents a gallon. Either association could\r\ndiscontinue the agreement on ten days’ notice. The producers, before\r\nsigning the contract, insisted that the Refiners’ Combination sign an\r\nagreement to take no rebates as long as the alliance lasted. This\r\nagreement in regard to rebates read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Whereas_, it is deemed desirable to execute a contract of even\r\n  date herewith between the Petroleum Producers’ Association and the\r\n  Petroleum Refiners’ Association for the purpose of securing a\r\n  co-operation for mutual protection, it is agreed by the Refiners’\r\n  Association that sections one and three of a contract made the 25th\r\n  of March, 1872, between certain trunk lines of railroads and a\r\n  committee of producers and refiners shall be and remain in full\r\n  force.\r\n\r\n                                 “Petroleum Refiners’ Association,\r\n                                   “JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, _President_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sections of the contract of the 25th of March referred to agreed\r\nthat no rebates or contracts or other arrangements should be made which\r\nwould give any party the slightest difference in rates, and that the\r\nrates should not be changed either for increase or decrease without\r\nfirst giving Mr. Hasson, the president of the Producers’ Union, at least\r\nninety days’ notice in writing. As we now know, Mr. Rockefeller himself\r\nwas receiving rebates when he signed this agreement.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, after five months of incessant work, the agency was\r\nready to begin disposing of oil. They set to work diligently at once to\r\napportion the 200,000 barrels the refiners had bought among the\r\ndifferent districts. It was a slow and irritating task, for a method of\r\napportionment and of gathering had to be devised, and, as was to be\r\nexpected, it aroused more or less dissatisfaction and many charges of\r\nfavouritism. The agency had the work well under way, however, and had\r\nshipped about 50,000 barrels when, on January 14, it was suddenly\r\nannounced that the refiners had _refused to take any more of the\r\ncontract oil_!\r\n\r\nThere was a hurried call of the Producers’ Council and a demand for an\r\nexplanation. A plausible one was ready from Mr. Rockefeller. “You have\r\nnot kept your part of the contract—you have not limited the supply of\r\noil[32]—there is more being pumped to-day than ever before in the\r\nhistory of the region. We can buy all we want at $2.50, and oil has sold\r\nwithin the week at two dollars. If you will not, or cannot, stop\r\nover-production, can you expect us to pay your price? We keep down the\r\noutput of refined, and so keep up the price. If you will not do the\r\nsame, you must not expect high prices.”\r\n\r\nWhat could the producers reply? In spite of their heroic measures, they\r\nhad not been able to curtail their output. It seemed as if Nature,\r\noutraged that her generosity should be so manipulated as to benefit only\r\nthe few, had opened her veins to flood the earth with oil, so that all\r\nmen might know that here was a light cheap enough for the poorest of\r\nthem. Her lavish outpouring now swept away all of the artificial\r\nrestraints the producers and refiners had been trying to build. The\r\nProducers’ Association seemed suddenly to comprehend their folly in\r\nsupposing that when 5,000 barrels more of oil was produced each day than\r\nthe market demanded any combination could long keep the contract the\r\nrefiners had made with them; and their unhappy session, made more\r\nunhappy by the reading of bitter and accusing letters from all over the\r\ndiscontented region, ended in a complete stampede from the refiners, the\r\nvote for dissolving the alliance having but one dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nThere were few tears shed in the Oil Regions over the rupture of the\r\ncontract. The greater part of the oil men had called it from the\r\nbeginning an “unholy alliance,” and rejoiced that it was a fiasco. If\r\nthe alliance had been all that came to an end, the case would not have\r\nbeen so serious, but it was not. The breaking of the alliance proved the\r\ndeath of the agency and the association. The leaders who had disapproved\r\nof the treaty withdrew from active work; the supporters of the alliance,\r\ndemoralised by its failure, were glad to keep quiet. A few spasmodic\r\nefforts to stop the drill, to inaugurate another shut-down, were made,\r\nbut failed. Most of the producers felt that, as oil was so low, their\r\nonly safety was in getting as large a production as they could, and a\r\nperfect fever of development followed. The Producers’ Association, after\r\nten months of as exciting and strenuous effort as an organisation has\r\never put in, was snuffed out almost in a day. It was to be five years\r\nbefore the oil men recovered sufficiently from the shock of this\r\ncollapse to make another united effort. If Mr. Rockefeller felt in the\r\nfall of 1872 that the “good of the oil business” required the\r\ndissolution of the Producers’ Agency, he could not have acted with more\r\nacumen than he did in leading them into an alliance, and at the\r\npsychological moment throwing up his contract.\r\n\r\nHumiliated as the producers were by their failure, they soon found\r\nconsolation in the knowledge that the Refiners’ Association was in\r\ntrouble. A serious thing, in fact, had happened. When the official\r\nreport of the year’s exports and imports came out, it was shown that the\r\nexports of refined oil had fallen off for the first time in the history\r\nof the business. In 1871, 132,178,843 gallons had been exported. In\r\n1872, only 118,259,832 were exported. Just as alarming was the proof\r\nthat the shale and coal-oil refineries of Europe had taken a fresh\r\nstart—that they were selling their products more cheaply than kerosene\r\ncould be imported and sold. There was a general outcry from all over the\r\ncountry that Mr. Rockefeller and his associates were running the oil\r\nbusiness by keeping up the price of refined oil beyond what the price of\r\ncrude justified. The producers, eager for a scapegoat, argued that the\r\nlow price of crude was due to decreased consumption as well as\r\nover-production, and their ill-will against Mr. Rockefeller flared up\r\nanew. In the meantime the Refiners’ Association was having troubles of\r\nits own. The members were not limiting their output as they had\r\nagreed—that is, it was discovered every now and then that a refinery was\r\nmaking more oil than Mr. Rockefeller had directed. Again, what was more\r\nfatal to the success of the association, members sometimes sold at a\r\nlower price than that set by Mr. Rockefeller. These restrictions were\r\nfundamental to the success of the combination, and the members were\r\ncalled together at Saratoga in June, 1873, and after a long session the\r\nassociation was dissolved.\r\n\r\nThere was loud exultation in the unthinking part of the Oil Regions over\r\nthe dissolution of the refiners. The “Junior Anaconda” was dead. The\r\nwiser part of the region did not exult. They knew that though the\r\ncombination might dissolve, the Standard Oil Company of Cleveland still\r\ncontrolled its one-fifth of the capacity of the country; that not only\r\nhad Mr. Rockefeller been able to hold the twenty refineries he had\r\nbolted so summarily at the opening of 1872, but he had assimilated them\r\nso thoroughly that he was making enormous profits. Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\ncontracts with the Central Railroad alone in 1873 and 1874 obliged him\r\nfor seven months of the year to ship at least 100,000 barrels of refined\r\noil a month to the seaboard. As a matter of fact he never shipped less\r\nthan 108,000 barrels, and in one month of the period it rose to\r\n180,000.[33] Now in 1873 he made, at the very lowest figure, three cents\r\na gallon on his oil. Estimating his shipments simply at 700,000 barrels\r\na year—and they were much more—his profits for that year were\r\n$1,050,000, and this accounts for no profits on about thirty-five per\r\ncent. of the Standard output, which was sold locally or shipped\r\nWestward. Little wonder that the Cleveland refiners who had been snuffed\r\nout the year before, and who saw their plants run at such advantage,\r\ngrew bitter, or that gossip said the daily mail of the president of the\r\nStandard Oil Company was enlivened by so many threats of revenge that he\r\ntook extraordinary precautions about appearing unguarded in public.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing that these great profits were not being used for\r\nprivate purposes. In 1872 the Standard Oil Company paid a dividend of\r\nthirty-seven per cent., but in 1873 they cut it to fifteen per cent. The\r\nprofits were going almost solidly into the extension and solidification\r\nof the business. Mr. Rockefeller was building great barrel factories,\r\nthus cutting down to the minimum one of a refiner’s heaviest expenses.\r\nHe was buying tank cars that he might be independent of the vagaries of\r\nthe railroads in allotting cars. He was gaining control of terminal\r\nfacilities in New York. He was putting his plants into the most perfect\r\ncondition, introducing every improved process which would cheapen his\r\nmanufacturing by the smallest fraction of a cent. He was diligently\r\nhunting methods to get a larger percentage of profit from crude oil.\r\nThere was, perhaps, ten per cent. of waste at that period in crude oil.\r\nIt hurt him to see it unused, and no man had a heartier welcome from the\r\npresident of the Standard Oil Company than he who would show him how to\r\nutilise any proportion of his residuum. In short, Mr. Rockefeller was\r\nstrengthening his line at every point, and to no part of it was he\r\ngiving closer attention than to transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER FIVE\r\n                   LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS OF A TRUST\r\n\r\n  EVIDENCE OF REAPPEARANCE OF REBATES SOON AFTER AGREEMENT OF MARCH 25\r\n    IS SIGNED—PRINCIPLE THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT LARGE SHIPPERS SHALL\r\n    HAVE ADVANTAGES OVER SMALL SHIPPERS IN SPITE OF RAILROADS’ DUTY AS\r\n    COMMON CARRIERS—AGREEMENT WORKED OUT BY WHICH THREE ROADS ARE TO\r\n    HAVE FIXED PERCENTAGE OF EASTERN SHIPMENTS—OIL REGIONS ROBBED OF\r\n    THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL ADVANTAGE—THE RUTTER CIRCULAR—ROCKEFELLER NOW\r\n    SECRETLY PLANS REALISATION OF HIS DREAM OF PERSONAL CONTROL OF THE\r\n    REFINING OF OIL—ORGANISATION OF THE CENTRAL ASSOCIATION—H.

The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern and the\r\nNew York Central had never kept them, as we have seen. Mr. Flagler’s\r\nstatement that the Standard received a rebate of twenty-five cents a\r\nbarrel from April 1 to November 15, 1872, would seem to show that while\r\nwith one hand Mr. Clark and Mr. Vanderbilt signed the agreement with the\r\noil men that henceforth freights should be “on a basis of perfect\r\nequality to all shippers, producers and refiners, and that no rebates,\r\ndrawbacks, or other arrangements of any character should be made or\r\nallowed that would give any party the slightest difference in rates or\r\ndiscriminations of any character whatever,” with the other they had\r\nsigned an arrangement to give a twenty-five-cent rebate to Mr.\r\nRockefeller! They certainly had a strong incentive for ignoring their\r\npledge. Consider what Mr. Rockefeller could offer the road—sixty\r\ncar-loads of oil a day, over 4,000 barrels. General Devereux points out\r\nin the affidavit already mentioned[34] what this meant. It permitted\r\nthem to make up a solid oil train and run it out every day. By running\r\nnothing else they reduced the average time of a freight car from\r\nCleveland to New York and return from thirty days to ten days. The\r\ninvestment for cars to handle their freight was reduced by this\r\narrangement to about one-third what it would have been if several\r\ndifferent persons were shipping the same amount every day. Promptness\r\nwas insured in forwarding and returning (a drawback of from fifty\r\ndollars to $150 a day accrued if it was late, so that the Standard was\r\nbound to ship promptly), and all the inconvenience of dealing with many\r\nshippers each with his peculiar whim or demand was avoided. It was\r\ncertainly worth a rebate to the Central, and the Central not having any\r\nprejudices in favour of keeping agreements because they were agreements\r\nnaturally conceded what Mr. Rockefeller wanted. There was another point.\r\nIf the Central did not concede to Mr. Rockefeller’s terms it undoubtedly\r\nwould lose the freight. There was the lake and the canal and there was\r\nthe Erie!\r\n\r\nNow it is not supposable that such an arrangement would go on long\r\nwithout leaking out in the upper oil circles. We have evidence that it\r\ndid not. Indeed, there was among certain intelligent oil men a\r\nconviction when the agreement was signed that the New York roads would\r\nnot regard it—that if they did it would ruin the refining business of\r\nCleveland. W. T. Scheide, a member of the oil men’s committee making\r\nthis contract, the agent of one of the largest oil shippers in the\r\ncountry, Adnah Neyhart, in some frank and suggestive testimony given to\r\nthe Hepburn Committee in 1879, said that at the time the arrangement was\r\nmade he did not think anybody connected with the business expected it\r\nwould last. “My reason for that was that it was an impossible\r\nagreement,” said Mr. Scheide. “The immediate effect of it would have\r\nbeen to have utterly destroyed fifty-five per cent. of the refining\r\ninterest of the country; that is to say, Cleveland and Pittsburg, which\r\nduring the previous four years had shipped fifty-five per cent. of all\r\nthe oil out of the Oil Regions—they, in addition to paying the rates of\r\nfreights which all other refiners would have had to pay, were required\r\nto pay fifty cents a barrel on their crude oil to their works.” The\r\nrefiners in Cleveland and Pittsburg had of course always paid to get\r\ncrude oil to their works, even the South Improvement Company tariffs\r\nprovided for that, and under that arrangement Cleveland had come to be\r\nin 1871 the chief refining centre of the country. The chairman of the\r\ncommittee examining Mr. Scheide suggested it was a “temporary\r\nimpossibility which would have adjusted itself,” which Mr. Scheide\r\nadmitted. “Yes, sir, naturally, it would have adjusted itself I suppose,\r\nbut the effect was very marked at the time.”\r\n\r\nSo strong was Mr. Scheide’s conviction that the New York roads would not\r\nstand the new rates that on the 10th of April he went to the\r\nPennsylvania railroad and asked for a rebate on Mr. Neyhart’s crude\r\nshipments—and got it. What the rebate was he does not state, but Mr.\r\nFlagler tells us in his testimony[35] that in December he discovered\r\nthat the Pennsylvania was shipping for as low as $1.05 a barrel. And for\r\none month he got from Mr. Vanderbilt a rate of $1.05 on his 4,000\r\nbarrels a day.\r\n\r\nMr. Scheide was also shipping refined oil over the Erie. George R.\r\nBlanchard, who in October, 1872, became the general freight agent of the\r\nErie, told the Hepburn Committee in 1879 that he found on entering his\r\nposition that $7,000 in rebates had been paid Mr. Scheide for Mr.\r\nNeyhart in the month of September, 1872, on this refined. He does not\r\nsay how long this had been going on. Mr. Blanchard found at the same\r\ntime the March 25 agreement. He asked why it was not observed, and the\r\nreply convinced him that it had not been kept more than two weeks by the\r\nPennsylvania and Central systems. “The representations made to me,” says\r\nMr. Blanchard, “also convinced the Atlantic and Great Western as to what\r\nour rivals were doing, and that railway company and our own decided to\r\ncontinue to pay the twenty-four cents per barrel drawback then being\r\npaid on the rate of $1.35, provided by their producers’ agreement of\r\nMarch 25, 1872.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Blanchard was shipping only Mr. Neyhart’s refined, and naturally\r\nhe looked for more business and was willing to give a rebate to get it.\r\nHe soon had some from another of the oil men who had signed the\r\nagreement of March 25. This was Mr. Bennett, of Titusville, who with J.\r\nD. Archbold and his other partners entered into a contract with Mr.\r\nBlanchard to ship their entire product for a year at a rate considerably\r\nbelow the one agreed upon on March 25.[36] The contract was a\r\nshort-lived one, for in November Mr. Bennett and his partners turned\r\ntheir shipments over to the Pennsylvania. The Erie had some\r\ncompensation, however, in the fact that in July, 1873, Mr. Neyhart’s\r\ncrude shipments had all come to them. Mr. Scheide, Mr. Neyhart’s agent,\r\nexplained to the Hepburn Commission that he left the Pennsylvania\r\nbecause of what he considered “very bad treatment—a discrimination\r\nagainst us in furnishing us cars.” The Pennsylvania had indeed\r\nundertaken to carry out the clause in the agreement of March 25 which\r\nstipulated that there should be no discrimination in furnishing cars.\r\nMr. Scheide, considering himself “their shipper,” that is, shipping\r\nlarger quantities more regularly than anybody else, and as a consequence\r\nhaving better rates, thought it unfair that the cars should be pro\r\nrated,[37] and left the road, giving his business to the Erie, where\r\npresumably he got assurances that cars would be furnished to shippers\r\naccording to the quantity and regularity of shipments. Mr. Scheide’s\r\nexcellent testimony is good evidence of how deep a hold the principle\r\nthat the large shippers are to have all the advantages had taken hold of\r\nsome of the best men in the oil country, although the oil country as a\r\nwhole utterly repudiated the “rebate business.” These details, all drawn\r\nfrom sworn testimony, show how, before a year had passed after the end\r\nof the Oil War, all the roads were practising discrimination, how a few\r\nshippers were again engaged in a scramble for advantages, and how the\r\nbig shippers were bent on re-establishing the principle supposed to have\r\nbeen overthrown by the Oil War that one shipper is more convenient and\r\nprofitable for a road than many, and this being so, the matter of a\r\nroad’s duty as a common carrier has nothing to do with the question.[38]\r\n\r\nThis was the situation when in June, 1873, General Devereux, whom we\r\nhave met on the Lake Shore road, became president of the Atlantic and\r\nGreat Western. Now at this time Peter H. Watson, the president of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company, was president of the Erie. The two at once\r\nlooked into the condition of their joint oil traffic. They found the\r\nrebate system abolished a year before again well intrenched.\r\nNevertheless the Erie was not doing much business. The entire shipments\r\nof oil over the Erie for 1873 were but 762,000 barrels out of a total of\r\n4,963,000. Naturally they went to work to build up a trade, and their\r\nrelations being what they had been with the Standard, the company\r\ncontrolling a third of the country’s refining capacity, they went to\r\nthem to see if they could not get a percentage of their seaboard\r\nshipments from Cleveland. Mr. Rockefeller was willing to give them\r\nshipments if they would make the rates as low as were given to any of\r\nhis competitors on any of the roads, and if they would deliver his oil\r\nat Hunter’s Point, Brooklyn, where he had oil yards, and where the\r\nCentral delivered, or if they would not do that if they would lease\r\ntheir own oil yards to him. There was an excellent business reason for\r\nmaking that latter demand, which Mr. Blanchard explained to the Hepburn\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n“The Standard,” said Mr. Blanchard, “had a force of men, real estate,\r\nhouses, tanks and other facilities at Hunter’s Point for receiving and\r\ncoopering the oil; and they had their cooperage materials delivered over\r\nthere. The arrangement prior to that time was that the Erie Company\r\nperformed this service for its outside refiners at Weehawken, for which\r\nthe Erie Company made specific charges and added them to their rates for\r\nfreight. The Standard Company said to us: ‘We do the business at low\r\ncost at Hunter’s Point because we are expert oil men and know how to\r\nhandle it; we pay nobody a profit, and cannot and ought not to pay you a\r\nprofit for a service that is not transportation any more than inspecting\r\nflour or cotton; and the New York Central delivers our oil at that\r\npoint. Now if you will deliver our oil at Hunter’s Point and permit us\r\nto do this business, you may do so; we want to do that business, and we\r\ncannot pay to the Erie Railway Company at Weehawken a profit on all of\r\nthose staves, heads, cooperage, filling, refilling and inspection, for\r\nwe have our own forces of men and our own yards necessary for this work\r\nin another part of the harbour of New York; and it is not a part of your\r\nbusiness as a carrier, anyway.’\r\n\r\n“In lieu thereof and for the profits that we could have made from the\r\naggregate of these charges, we said to them: ‘If you will pay us a fixed\r\nprofit upon each one of these barrels of oil arriving here, you may take\r\nthe yards and run them subject to certain limitations as to what you\r\nshall do for other people who continue to ship oil to the same yards.’\r\nThey were only able to make this arrangement with us because of their\r\ncontrolling such a large percentage of shipment, and because of\r\npermanent facilities in Brooklyn; if the larger percentage of shipments\r\nhad belonged to outside parties, and they had had no yards of their own,\r\nwe would probably have retained the yards ourselves.”\r\n\r\nA contract was signed on April 17, 1874. By it the Standard agreed to\r\nship fifty per cent. of the products of its refineries by the Erie at\r\nrates “no higher than is paid by the competitors of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany from competing Western refineries to New York by all rail\r\nlines,” and to give all oil patrons of the Erie system a uniform price\r\nand fair and equal facilities at the Weehawken yards.[39] It was a very\r\nwise business deal for both parties. It made Mr. Rockefeller the\r\nfavoured shipper of a second trunk line (the Central system was already\r\nhis) and it gave him the control of that road’s oil terminal so that he\r\ncould know exactly what other oil patrons of the road were doing—one of\r\nthe advantages the South Improvement contract looked out for, it will be\r\nremembered. As for the Erie, it tied up to them an important trade and\r\nagain put them into a position to have something to say about the\r\ndivision of the oil traffic, the bulk of which outside of the Standard\r\nOil Company the Pennsylvania was handling. In connection with the\r\nCentral the Erie now said to the Pennsylvania that henceforth they\r\nproposed to maintain their position as oil shippers.\r\n\r\nThe natural result of the determination of the Central and Erie to get\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania a percentage of its freight was, of course,\r\nincreased cutting, and it looked as if a rate war was inevitable. At\r\nthis juncture Colonel Potts of the Empire Transportation Company,\r\nhandling all of the Pennsylvania freight, suggested to his rivals that\r\nit would be a favourable time for the three trunk lines to pool their\r\nseaboard oil freight. In the discussions of this proposition, which, of\r\ncourse, involved a new schedule of rates, there being now practically\r\nnone, it was suggested that henceforth freights be so adjusted that they\r\nwould be equal to all refiners, on crude and refined from all points.\r\nSuch an equalisation seems at first glance an unsolvable puzzle. The\r\nagents found it intricate enough. Throughout the summer of 1874 they\r\nworked on it, holding meetings at Long Branch and Saratoga and calling\r\ninto their counsels a few of the leading refiners, pipe-line men and\r\nproducers whom they could trust to keep quiet about the project.\r\n\r\nBy the first of September they had an agreement worked out by which each\r\nof the three roads was to have a fixed percentage of Eastern shipments.\r\nThe rates to the seaboard were to amount to the same for all refiners\r\nwherever located. That is, to use one of the illustrations employed by\r\nMr. Blanchard in explaining the scheme to the Hepburn Commission:\r\n“Suppose 100 barrels of refined oil to have been sent from Cleveland to\r\nNew York by rail; the consignee was required to first pay freight\r\ntherefor at New York upon delivery $1.90; to make this quantity of\r\nrefined oil at that time, he had already paid freight on say 133½\r\nbarrels of crude oil from the pipes to Cleveland at thirty-five cents\r\nper barrel or say $46.67; he had therefore paid out from the pipes to\r\nthe refinery and thence to New York by transportation only, on 100\r\nbarrels refined and the quantity of crude oil required to make it,\r\n$236.67 or $2.37 per barrel; therefore, at the end of the month we\r\nrefunded the $46.67 already paid on the crude oil. So that the rate paid\r\nnet was $1.90 to him and all other refiners.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FLEET OF OIL BOATS AT OIL CITY IN 1864\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn case of the refineries situated at the seaboard the cost of carrying\r\nfrom the Oil Regions the 133½ barrels of crude oil required to make 100\r\nbarrels of refined was made exactly the same as carrying the 100 barrels\r\nof refined made in the West and transported East. This really amounted\r\nto charging nothing for getting the crude oil to a refinery wherever it\r\nwas situated, as the following clause in the agreement shows: “The roads\r\ntransporting the refined oil shall refund to the refiners as a drawback\r\nthe charges paid by them upon the crude oil reaching their refineries by\r\nrail.” This paragraph provided for this crude rebate contained a second\r\nclause, which read: “And the roads transporting through crude oil to the\r\nEastern seaboard shall refund to the shippers twenty-two cents per\r\nbarrel; both of said drawbacks to be paid only on oil reaching the\r\ninitial points of rail shipment, through pipes, the owners of which\r\nmaintain agreed rates of pipage.” The paragraph announced two new and\r\nstartling intentions on the part of the oil-carrying roads: first, that\r\nthey intended to strip the Oil Regions of the advantage of geographical\r\nposition at the wells by sending oil free to Cleveland and Pittsburg,\r\nNew York and Philadelphia, at the same time leaving these cities the\r\nadvantages accruing from their position as manufacturing centres and\r\nclose to domestic markets; second, that they had entered into a\r\ncombination with certain pipe-lines to drive certain others out of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Blanchard gave the reasons of these two revolutionary moves to the\r\nHepburn Committee. It was “urgently represented to the trunk lines,” he\r\nsaid, “by some refiners at the West as well as by others at the\r\nseaboard, and also by crude shippers and receivers and by owners of\r\npipe-lines, that it was in every way desirable that the refiners of\r\nCleveland and Pittsburg, and those at the seaboard be put upon a basis\r\nof equalisation in the gross rates of transportation to and from the\r\nrefineries.” Now to do this the element of distance had to be\r\ndisregarded. Cleveland was 150 miles west of the Oil Regions, but she\r\nmust be treated as if she were at the same distance from the seaboard.\r\nAs soon as the proposition was made, certain of the refiners and\r\nproducers objected unless the railroads went further and equalised rates\r\non coal, acids, cooperage, etc. This, however, the roads declined to do.\r\n\r\nAs for the second clause—the rebate on all oil coming from pipes which\r\nkept up a fixed pipage—it came about in this way. While the railroad men\r\nwere in conference at Long Branch, Henry Harley, the president of the\r\nPennsylvania Transportation Company, came to them and said that he\r\nbelieved the scheme of equalisation could not be carried out unless some\r\nkind of an alliance was made with the pipe-lines. There had been a large\r\nincrease in the number of pipes in the four or five years preceding, and\r\na situation had arisen not unlike that in every other branch of the oil\r\nbusiness. There was perhaps twice the pipe capacity needed for gathering\r\nall the oil produced, and as the pipes were under at least a dozen\r\ndifferent managements, each fighting for business, the result was, of\r\ncourse, just what it had been on the railroads and in the markets—severe\r\ncutting of prices, rebates, special secret arrangements, confusion and\r\nloss. It had been only nine years since the first pipe-line had been a\r\nsuccess, and considering the phenomenal growth of the business and the\r\nimportant part the pipe played in it, it was of course a situation\r\nnatural enough. Like the overgrowth of refining and of production, it\r\nwas something only time and solidification of business could remedy.\r\n\r\nMr. Harley laid the situation before the railroad men and said to them:\r\n“We want you to help us keep up an even and equal pipage rate. Here we\r\nare representatives of the nine most important lines in the Oil Regions.\r\nWe want to put a stop to cutting and keep up a rate of thirty cents.\r\nCan’t you help us?” Now up to this time the railroad had had nothing to\r\ndo with pipe-line charges. It was, and still is, the custom for the\r\nbuyer of the oil to pay the pipage, that is, the oil producer on running\r\nthe oil into the pipe-line received a credit certificate for the oil. If\r\nhe held it in the line long he paid a storage charge. When he sold the\r\noil, the line ran it, and the buyer paid the charge for running. Now the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines proposed to the railroads a through rate from the\r\nwells to the seaboard as low as they currently made from the receiving\r\npoints on the railway, the pipes to get twenty per cent. of this through\r\nrate. The railroads were to agree not to receive oil from buyers except\r\nat as high a rate as the pipes charged; and to allow no pipe-line\r\noutside of the alliance a through rate from the wells. The memorandum\r\nsaid squarely that the intent and purpose of this was to make the United\r\nPipes the sole feeders of the railroads. It was a plan not unlike the\r\nSouth Improvement Company in design—to put everybody but yourself out of\r\nbusiness, and it had the merit of stating its intent and purpose with\r\nperfect candour.[40]\r\n\r\nThe railroad men seem not to have objected to the purpose, only to the\r\nterms of the proposed arrangement. Mr. Blanchard told the pipe committee\r\nthat he regarded it as the most violent attempt on the part of the tail\r\nto wag the dog that he had ever seen, and the representatives of the\r\nother roads agreed. They saw at once, however, how much more solid their\r\nown position would be if they could be sure that no pipe-line delivering\r\nto them would cut its rate, if there could be in effect a through rate\r\nfrom the wells, and after some discussion they proposed to the\r\npipe-lines to add twenty-two cents a barrel to the rail charges; that\r\nis, if the rate to the seaboard was $1.25, to collect from the shipper\r\n$1.47, and in case he could show that he had taken his oil from one of\r\nthe United Pipes to give him a rebate of twenty-two cents. Mr. Blanchard\r\nsaid that they proposed to do this until proof was had that the\r\nassociated pipe-lines were acting in good faith. Of course this\r\narrangement did not change the pipe-lines’ methods of collecting in the\r\nleast. It simply forced a uniform charge, and this charge was to be, it\r\nshould be noticed, regardless of distance. The charge for collecting and\r\ndelivering oil was to be thirty cents a barrel whether it was carried\r\none or ten miles—a practice which prevails to-day.\r\n\r\nWhile these negotiations were going on, the Oil Regions as a whole was\r\ntroubled by a vague rumour that freight rates were to be advanced. In\r\nthe two years since the Oil War the region, as a whole, had adjusted\r\nitself to the tariff schedule of March 25, 1872, and was doing very well\r\nthough working on a very much smaller margin of profits than ever\r\nbefore. The margin was sufficient, however, to keep the refineries in\r\nthe valley running most of the time, and several of the large ones were\r\nincreasing their plants. Detailed accounts of the condition of the works\r\nare to be had in the newspapers of the day. Thus, in the summer of 1874\r\nan editor of the Oil City Derrick made a tour of the creek refineries\r\nand reported all of the larger ones in Titusville and Oil City as\r\nprosperous and growing, and the small ones in the little towns between\r\nthese two points as “jogging along pleasantly.” The keen competition\r\nbetween the different refining points made it necessary to do business\r\nwith economy, and a rumour of a raise of freight rates naturally was\r\nlooked on with dread. It was not until September 12, however, that the\r\nnew arrangements were made known, and this was some time earlier than\r\nwas intended. The slip came about in this way. The general freight agent\r\nof the New York Central road, James H. Rutter, sent out on September 9 a\r\nprivate circular announcing the new arrangement,[41] an advance of fifty\r\ncents a barrel on refined oil shipped to the seaboard, no corresponding\r\nadvance for Cleveland and Pittsburg, a rebate of the cost of getting oil\r\nto the refineries and a rebate of twenty-two cents to those who\r\npatronised certain pipe-lines. And to this new schedule was appended\r\nthis consoling paragraph: “You will observe that under this system the\r\nrate is even and fair to all parties, preventing one locality taking\r\nadvantage of its neighbour by reason of some alleged or real facility it\r\nmay possess. Oil refiners and shippers have asked the roads from time to\r\ntime to make all rates even and they would be satisfied. This scheme\r\ndoes it and we trust will work satisfactorily to all.”\r\n\r\nAmong the refiners to whom the circular went was M. N. Allen of\r\nTitusville. Now Mr. Allen was the editor of an aggressive and lively\r\nnewspaper—the Courier. He had fought rings and deals from the beginning\r\nof his career as a refiner and as an editor. He had been one of the\r\nstrong opponents of the South Improvement Company and of the Refiners’\r\nAssociation which followed, and he saw at once the cloven foot in the\r\nRutter circular and hastened to denounce it in a strong editorial:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If by an agreement of the New York Central, the Erie, and the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railway Companies, crude oil—delivered from the\r\n  Titusville pipe—should be hauled from Titusville to Chicago, and\r\n  there refined, and the refined product then hauled to New York, all\r\n  at two dollars a barrel, for the refined thus carried, it would be\r\n  placing, by the railway companies, Chicago refiners upon the same\r\n  level with the Titusville refiners who, on and after October 1,\r\n  shall ship to New York refined made from crude oil taken from the\r\n  Titusville pipe. The new freight arrangement does not make such\r\n  provision for refiners at Chicago. But a Cleveland refiner may come\r\n  to Titusville and buy oil for delivery from the Titusville, the\r\n  Pennsylvania, the Church Run, or the Octave pipes, at this point,\r\n  take it to Cleveland, and, after refining, carry the product to the\r\n  seaboard at the same expense of freight, all told, that a refiner\r\n  here, taking his crude oil directly from the above pipes, would have\r\n  in placing his refined oil at the seaboard. This is stating the\r\n  matter exactly, and we see no necessity for comment hereupon.\r\n\r\n  Again, 1,000 barrels of crude oil are to be carried to the seaboard\r\n  for the same amount of money that will be required for carrying\r\n  there 715 barrels of refined, notwithstanding that crude oil is a\r\n  much more hazardous article of freight, from fire, than refined. If\r\n  this is not a very large discrimination in favour of seaboard\r\n  refiners, for which there is no compensation given to refiners in\r\n  the Oil Region, our perceptions are utterly weak.\r\n\r\n  Now, before putting into effect this new freight arrangement, it may\r\n  be well for the railway officials having the matter in charge to\r\n  take into consideration a certain little article of agreement, which\r\n  the people of Pennsylvania, on the 16th day of December last,\r\n  entered into among themselves, respecting railroads in this state.\r\n  In Article 17, Section 7, of our new constitution is the following\r\n  decree of the sovereign people of this commonwealth: “No\r\n  discrimination in charges or facilities for transportation shall be\r\n  made between transportation companies and individuals, or in favour\r\n  of either, by abatement, drawback or otherwise.”\r\n\r\n  Petroleum is a product of this state, and transportation companies\r\n  in taking it away must respect the fundamental law of the state.\r\n  And, while we ask for no favours, always supporting free trade from\r\n  principle, speaking in behalf of the refining interests of the Oil\r\n  Region, we do not propose quietly to submit to any discrimination by\r\n  transportation companies, doing business in the state, against our\r\n  interests. If by reason of our position we possess advantages for\r\n  refining oil here, over refiners outside, we have strong objections\r\n  against the action of the railway companies in taking from us such\r\n  advantages, by requiring us to pay for hauling a given quantity of\r\n  oil as much as they require of Cleveland refiners for hauling the\r\n  same amount of oil 300 miles greater distance; or for requiring us\r\n  to pay as much for hauling 715 barrels of refined oil as they\r\n  require for hauling 1,000 barrels of crude oil the same distance. If\r\n  the railroad companies will make all expenses of refining oil equal\r\n  to all points, we shall be satisfied. If they will make the price of\r\n  sulphuric acid 1½ cents a pound, the same as it is in New York,\r\n  instead of 2½ cents; if they will deliver caustic soda here free of\r\n  freight from New York; if they will put paints and glues here at the\r\n  same prices as those articles sell for in New York; if they will put\r\n  staves and heading and hoops for barrels here at the same figures\r\n  those articles cost in Cleveland, whether they do all these by\r\n  giving us rebates sufficient to cover all differences now against\r\n  us, or in any other way that will bring the same results, we will\r\n  accept the new arrangement without complaint. Until this shall be\r\n  done we shall ask the railway companies in hauling oil to confine\r\n  themselves to legitimate business, and to obey the new constitution,\r\n  in letter and spirit. It will behoove our citizens to see that their\r\n  new constitution is carefully respected.\r\n\r\n  We are opposed to the new arrangement for the large advance in the\r\n  price of freight upon oil. If the railroad companies have lost money\r\n  in carrying oil for the Cleveland refineries during several years\r\n  past, let not the whole petroleum interest, in its depressed\r\n  condition, be required to sustain the penalty. We submit to the\r\n  railway managers whether it is not right to charge for hauling goods\r\n  in proportion to the distance hauled, allowing a small discount,\r\n  perhaps, upon the rate per mile for the greater distance.\r\n\r\n  Our remarks upon this subject may have the colour of assurance, but,\r\n  from the large majority given last winter in favour of the new\r\n  constitution of this state, we have great confidence that the people\r\n  will not part with their sovereign rights, nor allow themselves to\r\n  be ruled by King Pool.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first the Oil Region was puzzled by the Rutter circular. It certainly\r\nwas plausible. Was it not true that every man shared equally under it?\r\nAs the days passed, the dazed mental condition into which it had thrown\r\nthe oil men cleared up. Mr. Allen’s editorials began to take effect. The\r\npipe-lines left out of the pool began to ask how it could be legal that\r\nthe railroads should enter into an arrangement which obviously would\r\ndrive them out of business. The creek refiners began to ask by what\r\nright the advantage of geographical position at the wells should be\r\ntaken from them, and Cleveland be allowed to retain the advantages of\r\nher proximity to the Western market; Pittsburg her position on the Ohio\r\nRiver and the market it commanded; all of the cities the advantage of\r\ntheir proximity to great local markets and to such necessary supplies as\r\nbarrels and acids. Besides, was it constitutional for the railroads thus\r\nto regulate interstate commerce? Was not the arrangement, as far as the\r\nPennsylvania was concerned, plainly prohibited by the new constitution\r\nof the state of Pennsylvania? The producers slowly began to realise,\r\ntoo, that the Rutter circular, like the South Improvement charter and\r\ncontracts, did not recognise them as a body. The contract of March 25,\r\n1872, provided that the rates fixed should not be “liable to any change\r\neither for increase or decrease without first giving to William Hasson,\r\npresident of the Producers’ Union, at Oil City, at least ninety days’\r\nnotice in writing of such contemplated change.” This agreement was\r\ntotally ignored. It was an “insolent equalisation,” the oil men\r\nconcluded, and the sum total of their dissatisfaction finally found\r\nexpression at a mass-meeting at Parker’s Landing, on October 2. Directly\r\nafter this meeting a committee appointed sent to Messrs. Scott,\r\nVanderbilt and Jewett, the new president of the Erie, letters calling\r\ntheir attention to the Rutter circular, and stating the objections of\r\nthe producers to it. These letters sent on October 6 received no\r\nattention from any of the railroad presidents addressed for over three\r\nweeks, when the following was received from the Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_:—Your communication of the 6th inst., to Thomas A.\r\n  Scott, president, was received, and has been referred to me.\r\n\r\n  In establishing the recent rates and arrangements for the\r\n  transportation of oil, the object which was at all times kept in\r\n  view was to place all interests on an equality, giving to no one an\r\n  undue advantage over any other.\r\n\r\n  We believe that this object has been accomplished, and that by\r\n  adhering to our present rates the interests both of the producers,\r\n  refiners and transporters will be promoted.\r\n\r\n                                Very truly yours,\r\n                                                        A. J. CASSATT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Brief, tardy and unsatisfactory,” was the Derrick’s characterisation of\r\nMr. Cassatt’s letter. It was evidence to the oil men that if anything\r\nwas to be done to break the new tariff it would have to be done in\r\ncourt, for the railroads meant to stand by their creation.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion of the Rutter circular Mr. Rockefeller’s name\r\nscarcely appeared. It was known that he had been admitted to the\r\nconferences at which the tariff was arranged. This was taken as a matter\r\nof course. There was nothing which concerned the oil business which John\r\nRockefeller was not on the inside of. Mr. Blanchard later stated that\r\nthe “crude equivalent” scheme was suggested by certain Western refiners.\r\nThe tremendous advantage Cleveland secured by the new arrangement,\r\npractically 300 miles of free transportation, seemed to prove, too, that\r\nMr. Rockefeller had not been inactive during the conference. Whether he\r\nhad or had not suggested the points in the “Rutter circular” so\r\nadvantageous to his interests, he used them now to aid him in\r\naccomplishing one of the shrewdest and most far-reaching moves of his\r\nlife—the move which was to lead at last to the realisation of his Great\r\nPurpose—the concentration of the oil business in his own hands. For Mr.\r\nRockefeller, quiet as he had been since the breaking up of the Refiners’\r\nAssociation in the summer of 1873, had by no means given up the idea of\r\ndoing for the refining interest of the whole country what he had done\r\nfor that of Cleveland through the South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller has shown repeatedly in his conquering business career\r\nremarkable ability to learn from experience. The breaking up of the\r\nRefiners’ Association _may_ have seemed a disaster to him. He did not\r\nallow it to be a profitless disaster. He extracted useful lessons from\r\nthe experience, and, armed with this new wisdom, bent his whole mind to\r\nworking out a third plan of campaign. He now knew that he could not hope\r\nto make again so rich a haul as he had made through the defunct South\r\nImprovement scheme. The experience of the past year with the refiners\r\nconvinced him that it would take time to educate them to his idea of\r\ncombination; but he had learned who of them were capable of this\r\neducation. As for the producers, the alliance attempted with them was\r\nenough to demonstrate that they would never endure long the restraints\r\nof any association. Besides, the bulk of them still held the, to him,\r\nunpractical belief that rebates were _wrong_. Mr. Rockefeller had also\r\nre-learned in these eighteen months what he knew pretty well before,\r\nthat the promise to give or take away a heavy freight traffic was enough\r\nto persuade any railroad king of the day to break the most solemn\r\ncompact.\r\n\r\nWith all these reflections fresh in mind, Mr. Rockefeller again bent\r\nover a map of the refining interests of the United States. Here was the\r\nworld he sighed to conquer. If we may suppose him to have begun his\r\ncampaign as a great general with whom he has many traits in common—the\r\nFirst Napoleon—used to begin his, by studding a map with red-headed pegs\r\nmarking the points he must capture, Mr. Rockefeller’s chart would have\r\nshown in and around Boston perhaps three pegs, representing a crude\r\ncapacity of 3,500 barrels; in and around New York fifteen pegs, a\r\ncapacity of 9,790 barrels; in and around Philadelphia twelve pegs, a\r\ncapacity of 2,061 barrels; in Pittsburg twenty-two pegs, a capacity of\r\n6,090 barrels; on the creek twenty-seven pegs, a capacity of 9,231\r\nbarrels.[42] His work was to get control of this multitude of red pegs\r\nand to fly above them the flag of what the irreverent call the “holy\r\nblue barrel.”[43]\r\n\r\nSome time in the summer of 1874, after it had become certain that\r\nColonel Potts’s plan for an equalisation of oil freights would be\r\ncarried out, Mr. Rockefeller wrote to his former colleague in the South\r\nImprovement Company, W. G. Warden, of Philadelphia, telling him he\r\nwanted to talk over the condition of the oil business with him, and\r\ninviting him to bring Charles Lockhart, of Pittsburg, to that Mecca of\r\nAmerican schemers, Saratoga, for a conference with him and Mr. Flagler.\r\nMr. Warden hesitated. He had been much abused for his relation with the\r\nSouth Improvement Company. He had seen the National Refiners’\r\nAssociation fail. He had begun to feel a distaste for combination.\r\nBesides, he was doing very well in Philadelphia. However, after some\r\nhesitation, he and Mr. Lockhart went to Saratoga. The four gentlemen\r\nbreakfasted together and later strolled out to a pavilion. Here they\r\ndiscussed again, as they had nearly three years before, when they\r\nprepared the South Improvement assault, the condition of the oil\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GEORGE H. BISSELL\r\n\r\n  Founder of the first oil company in the United States.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JONATHAN WATSON\r\n\r\n  One of the owners of the land on which the first successful well was\r\n    drilled for oil.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL KIER\r\n\r\n  The first petroleum refined and sold for lighting purpose was made by\r\n    Mr. Kier in the ’50s in Pittsburg.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOSHUA MERRILL\r\n\r\n  The chemist and refiner to whom many of the most important processes\r\n    now in use in making illuminating and lubricating oils are due.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller now had something besides a theory to present to the\r\ngentlemen he wished to go into his third scheme. He had the most\r\npersuasive of all arguments—an actual achievement. “Three years ago,” he\r\ncould tell them, “I took over the Cleveland refineries. I have managed\r\nthem so that to-day I pay a profit to nobody. I do my own buying, I make\r\nmy own acid and barrels, I control the New York terminals of both the\r\nErie and Central roads, and ship such quantities that the railroads give\r\nme better rates than they do any other shipper. In 1873 I shipped over\r\n700,000 barrels by the Central, and my profit on my capitalisation,\r\n$2,500,000, was over $1,000,000. This is the result of combination in\r\none city. The railroads now have arranged a new tariff, by which they\r\nmean to put us all on an equal footing. They say they will give no\r\nrebates to anyone, but if we can join with Cleveland the strongest\r\nforces in other great shipping points, and apply to them the same\r\ntactics I have employed, we shall become the largest shipper, and can\r\ndemand a rebate in return for an equal division of our freight. We\r\nproved in 1872–1873 that we could not do anything by an open\r\nassociation. Let us who see what a combination strictly carried out will\r\neffect unite secretly to accomplish it. Let us become the nucleus of a\r\n_private_ company which gradually shall acquire control of all\r\nrefineries everywhere, become the only shippers, and consequently the\r\nmaster of the railroads in the matter of freight rates.” It was six\r\nhours before the gentlemen in conference left the pavilion, and when\r\nthey came out Mr. Warden and Mr. Lockhart had agreed to transfer their\r\nrefineries in Philadelphia and Pittsburg to the Standard Oil Company, of\r\nCleveland, taking stock in exchange. They had also agreed to absorb, as\r\nrapidly as persuasion or other means could bring it about, the\r\nrefineries in their neighbourhood. Their union with the Standard was to\r\nremain an absolute secret—the concerns operating under their respective\r\nnames.[44]\r\n\r\nOn October 15, 1874, Mr. Rockefeller consummated another purchase of as\r\ngreat importance. He bought the works of Charles Pratt and Company, of\r\nNew York city. As before, the purchase was secret. The strategic\r\nimportance of these purchases for one holding Mr. Rockefeller’s vast\r\nambition was enormous. It gave him as allies men who were among the most\r\nsuccessful refiners, without doubt, in each of the three greatest\r\nrefining centres of the country outside of Cleveland, where he ruled,\r\nand of the creek, where he had learned that neither he nor any member of\r\nthe South Improvement Company could do business with facility. To meet\r\nthese purchases the stock of the Standard Oil Company was increased, on\r\nMarch 10, 1875, to $3,500,000.[45] The value of the concern as a\r\nmoney-earner at this early date, 1874, is shown by the fact that Pratt\r\nand Company paid not less than $265 for the Standard stock they received\r\nin exchange for their works.[46]\r\n\r\nThe first intimation that the Oil Region had that Mr. Rockefeller was\r\npushing another combination was in March of 1875, when it was announced\r\nthat an organisation of refiners, called the Central Association, of\r\nwhich he was president, had been formed. Its main points were that if a\r\nrefiner would lease to the association his plant for a term of months he\r\nwould be allowed to subscribe for stock of the new company. The lease\r\nallowed the owner to do his own manufacturing, but gave Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s company “irrevocable authority” to make all purchases of\r\ncrude oil and sales of refined, to decide how much each refinery should\r\nmanufacture, and _to negotiate for all freight and pipe-line expenses_.\r\nThe Central Association was a most clever device. It furnished the\r\nsecret partners of Mr. Rockefeller a plausible proposition with which to\r\napproach the firms of which they wished to obtain control.\r\n\r\nLittle as the Oil Regions knew of the real meaning of the Central\r\nAssociation, the news of its organisation raised a cry of monopoly, and\r\nthe advocates of the new scheme felt called upon to defend it. The\r\ndefense took the line that the conditions of the trade made such a\r\ncombination of refineries necessary. Altogether the ablest explanation\r\nwas that of H. H. Rogers, of Charles Pratt and Company, to a reporter of\r\nthe New York Tribune:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There are five refining points in the country,” said Mr. Rogers,\r\n  “Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Cleveland, the Oil Regions and New York\r\n  city. Each of these has certain local advantages which may be\r\n  briefly stated as follows: Pittsburg, cheap oil; Philadelphia, the\r\n  seaboard; Cleveland, cheap barrels, and canal as well as railroad\r\n  transportation; the Oil Regions, crude oil at the lowest figure; and\r\n  all the products of petroleum have the best market in New York city.\r\n  The supply of oil is three or four times greater than the\r\n  demand.[47] If the oil refineries were run to their full capacity,\r\n  the market would be overstocked. The business is not regular, but\r\n  spasmodic. When the market is brisk and oil is in demand, all the\r\n  oil interests are busy and enjoy a fair share of prosperity. At\r\n  other times, the whole trade is affected by the dullness. It has\r\n  been estimated that not less than twenty millions of dollars are\r\n  invested in the oil business. It is therefore to the interest of\r\n  every man who has put a dollar in it to have the trade protected and\r\n  established on a permanent footing. Speculators have ruined the\r\n  market. The brokers heretofore have been speculating upon the market\r\n  with disastrous effects upon the trade, and this new order of things\r\n  will force them to pursue their legitimate calling, and realise\r\n  their profits from their industry and perseverance. Two years ago an\r\n  attempt was made to organise an oil refiners’ association, but it\r\n  was subsequently abandoned. There was no cohesion of interests, and\r\n  agreements were not kept. The movement at the present time is a\r\n  revival of the former idea, and, it is believed, has already secured\r\n  fully nine-tenths of the oil refiners in the country in its favour.\r\n  I do not believe there is any intention among the oil men to ‘bull’\r\n  the market. The endeavour is to equalise all around and protect the\r\n  capital invested. If by common consent, in good faith, the refiners\r\n  agree to reduce the quantities to an allotment for each, made in\r\n  view of the supply and demand, and the capacity for production, the\r\n  market can be regulated with a reasonable profit for all. The price\r\n  of oil to-day is fifteen cents per gallon. The proposed allotment of\r\n  business would probably advance the price to twenty cents. To make\r\n  an artificial increase, with immense profits, would be recognised as\r\n  speculative instead of legitimate, and the oil interests would\r\n  suffer accordingly. Temporary capital would compete with permanent\r\n  investment and ruin everything. The oil producers to-day are\r\n  bankrupt. There have been more failures during the last five months\r\n  than in five years previously. An organisation to protect the oil\r\n  capital is imperatively needed. Oil to yield a fair profit should be\r\n  sold for twenty-five cents per gallon. That price would protect\r\n  every interest and cover every outlay for getting out the crude\r\n  petroleum, transporting by railroad, refining and the incidental\r\n  charges of handling, etc. The foreign markets will regulate the\r\n  price to a great extent, because they are the greatest consumers.\r\n  The people of China, Germany, and other foreign countries cannot\r\n  afford to pay high prices. Kerosene oil is a luxury to them, and\r\n  they do not receive sufficient compensation for their labour to\r\n  enable them to use this oil at an extravagant price. The price,\r\n  therefore, must be kept within reasonable limits.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oil Regions refused flatly to accept this view of the situation. The\r\nworld would not buy refined at twenty-five cents, they argued. “You\r\ninjured the foreign market in 1872 by putting up the price. Our only\r\nhope is in increasing consumption. The world is buying more oil to-day\r\nthan ever before, because it is cheap. We must learn to accept small\r\nprofits, as other industries do.” “The formation of the Refiners’\r\nAssociation has thrust upon the trade an element of uncertainty that has\r\nunsettled all sound views as to the general outlook,” said the Derrick.\r\n“The scope of the Association,” wrote a Pittsburg critic, “is an attempt\r\nto control the refining of oil, with the ultimate purpose of advancing\r\nits price and reaping a rich harvest in profits. This can only be done\r\nby reducing the production of refined oil, and this will in turn act on\r\ncrude oil, making the stock so far in excess of the demand as to send it\r\ndown to a lower figure than it has yet touched.”\r\n\r\n“The most important feature of this contract,” said a “veteran refiner,”\r\n“is perhaps that part which provides that the Executive Committee of the\r\nCentral Association are to have the exclusive power to arrange with the\r\nrailroads for the carrying of the crude and refined oil. It is intended\r\nby this provision to enable the Executive Committee to speak for the\r\nwhole trade in securing special rates of freight, whereby independent\r\nshippers of crude oil, and such refiners as refuse to join the\r\ncombination, and any new refining interest that may be started, may be\r\ndriven out of the trade. The whole general purpose of the combination is\r\nto reap a large margin by depressing crude and raising the price of\r\nrefined oil, and the chief means employed is the system of\r\ndiscrimination in railroad freights to the seaboard.”\r\n\r\n“The veteran refiner” was right in his supposition that Mr. Rockefeller\r\nintended to use the enormous power his combination gave him to get a\r\nspecial rate. As a matter of fact he had seen to that before the\r\n“veteran refiner” expressed his mind. It will be remembered that in\r\nApril, 1874, Mr. Rockefeller had made a contract with the Erie by which\r\nhe was to ship fifty per cent. of his refined oil over that road at a\r\nrate as low as any competing line gave any shipper and he was to have a\r\nlease of the Weehawken oil terminal. Now this contract remained in force\r\nuntil the first of March, 1875, when a new one was made with the Erie\r\nguaranteeing the road the same percentage of freight and giving the\r\nStandard a ten per cent. rebate on whatever open tariff should be fixed.\r\nThis rebate Mr. Blanchard says was quite independent of what the Central\r\nmight be giving the Standard. He says that one reason the Standard was\r\ngiven the rebate was that it was suspected the Pennsylvania was allowing\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company an even larger one. If true, this\r\nwould not affect any refiner necessarily as the Empire was not a refiner\r\nin March, 1875. The real reason, of course, was what Mr. Blanchard gives\r\nlater—that by this rebate they kept the Standard trade, now greatly\r\nincreased by the purchase of the outside works already mentioned,\r\nalthough it should be noticed the Erie officials knew nothing of the\r\nStandard having control of any other refinery than that of Charles Pratt\r\nand Company.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the Central Association put an altogether new\r\nfeature on oil transportation. If this organisation succeeded, and the\r\nrefiners in it claimed nine-tenths of the capacity of the country—it\r\ngave Mr. Rockefeller “irrevocable authority” to negotiate freights. The\r\nPennsylvania road immediately felt the pressure. The oil they had\r\ncarried for big firms like those of Charles Lockhart in Pittsburg and of\r\nWarden, Frew and Company in Philadelphia was in the hands of the\r\nStandard Oil Company, and Mr. Rockefeller asked a rebate of ten per\r\ncent. on open rates. The road demurred. Colonel Potts objected\r\nstrenuously. Three years later in a paper discussing this rebate and its\r\nconsequences he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The rebate was a modest one, as was its recipient. Yet the railway\r\n  Cassandras prophesied from it a multitude of evils—a gradual\r\n  destruction of all other refiners and a gradual absorption of their\r\n  property by the favourite, who, with this additional armament, would\r\n  rapidly progress towards a control of all cars, all pipes, all\r\n  production, and finally of the roads themselves. Their prophecies\r\n  met but little faith or consideration. The Standard leaders\r\n  themselves were especially active in discouraging any such radical\r\n  purpose. Their little rebate was enough for them. Everybody else\r\n  should prosper, as would be shortly seen. They needed no more\r\n  refineries; they had already more than they could employ—why should\r\n  they hunger after greater burdens? It was the railroads they chiefly\r\n  cared for, and next in their affections stood the 100 rival\r\n  refineries. Such beneficent longings as still remained (and their\r\n  bosoms overflowed with them) spread out their steady waves toward\r\n  the poor producers whom, not to be impious, they had always been\r\n  ready to gather under their wings, yet they would not.\r\n\r\n  “This unselfish language soothed all alarm into quiet slumbering. It\r\n  resembles the gentle fanning of the vampire’s wings, and it had the\r\n  same end in view—the undisturbed abstraction of the victim’s blood.”\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Potts’s argument against the rebate—doubtless clothed in much\r\nless picturesque language in 1875 than his feelings stirred him to in\r\n1878, for a good enough reason, too, as we shall see—failed to convince\r\nthe Pennsylvania officials. They decided to yield to the Standard. Mr.\r\nCassatt, then third vice-president of the road, in charge of\r\ntransportation, said in 1879 that the rebate was given because they\r\nfound the Standard was getting very strong, that they had the backing of\r\nthe other roads, and that if the Pennsylvania wanted to retain its full\r\nshare of business and at fair rates they must make arrangements to\r\nprotect themselves.\r\n\r\nNo one of the roads knew certainly what the others were doing for the\r\nStandard until October 1, 1875. The freight agents then met to discuss\r\nagain the freight pool they had formed in 1874. It had not been working\r\nwith perfect satisfaction. The clause granting the rebate of twenty-two\r\ncents to the pipe-lines which sustained an agreed rate of pipage had\r\nbeen abandoned after about five months’ experiment. It was thought to\r\nstimulate new pipes. The roads in making a new adjustment made no effort\r\nto regulate pipe-line tariffs. The “crude rebate” as it was\r\ncalled—carrying oil to a refinery for nothing—was left in force. At this\r\nmeeting Mr. Blanchard found that both of the Erie’s big rivals were\r\ngranting the Standard a ten per cent. rebate. He also found that he was\r\nnot getting fifty per cent. of the Standard’s business as the contract\r\ncalled for—that the Standard controlled not only the Cleveland and New\r\nYork works of which he knew, but large works in Pittsburg and\r\nPhiladelphia.[48]\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller was certainly now in an excellent condition to work out\r\nhis plan of bringing under his own control all the refineries of the\r\ncountry. The Standard Oil Company owned in each of the great refining\r\ncentres, New York, Pittsburg and Philadelphia, a large and aggressive\r\nplant run by the men who had built it up. These works were, so far as\r\nthe public knew, still independent and their only relation that of the\r\n“Central Association.” As a matter of fact they were the “Central\r\nAssociation.” Not only had Mr. Rockefeller brought these powerful\r\ninterests into his concern; he had secured for them a rebate of ten per\r\ncent. on a rate which should always be as low as any one of the roads\r\ngave any of his competitors. He had done away with middlemen, that is,\r\nhe was “paying nobody a profit.” He had undeniably a force wonderfully\r\nconstructed for what he wanted to do and one made practically\r\nimpregnable as things were in the oil business then, by virtue of its\r\nspecial transportation rate.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his new line was complete the work of acquiring all outside\r\nrefineries began at each of the oil centres. Unquestionably the\r\nacquisitions were made through persuasion when this was possible. If the\r\nparty approached refused to lease or sell, he was told firmly what Mr.\r\nRockefeller had told the Cleveland refiners when he went to them in 1872\r\nwith the South Improvement contracts, that there was no hope for him;\r\nthat a combination was in progress which was bound to work; and that\r\nthose who stayed out would inevitably go to the wall. Naturally the\r\nfirst fruits to fall into the hands of the new alliance were those\r\nrefineries which were embarrassed or discouraged by the conditions which\r\nMr. Rogers explains above. Take as an example the case of the Citizens’\r\nOil Refining Company of Pittsburg, as it was explained in 1888 to the\r\nHouse Committee on Manufactures in its trust investigation. A. H. Tack,\r\na partner in the company, told the story:[49]\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We began in 1869 with a capacity of 1,000 barrels a day. At the\r\n  start everything was _couleur de rose_, so much so that we put our\r\n  works in splendid shape. We manufactured all the products. We even\r\n  got it down to making wax, and using the very last residuum in the\r\n  boilers. We got the works in magnificent order and used up\r\n  everything. We began to feel the squeeze in 1872. We did not know\r\n  what was the matter. Of course we were all affected the same way in\r\n  Pennsylvania, and of course we commenced shifting about, and meeting\r\n  together, and forming delegations, and going down to Philadelphia to\r\n  see the Pennsylvania Railroad, meeting after meeting and delegation\r\n  after delegation. We suspected there was something wrong, and told\r\n  those men there was something wrong somewhere; that we felt, so far\r\n  as position was concerned, we had the cheapest barrels, the cheapest\r\n  labour, and the cheapest coal, and the route from the crude district\r\n  was altogether in our favour. We had a railroad and a river to bring\r\n  us our raw material. We had made our investment based on the\r\n  seaboard routes, and we wanted the Pennsylvania Railroad to protect\r\n  us. But none of our meetings or delegations ever amounted to\r\n  anything. They were always repulsed in some way, put off, and we\r\n  never got any satisfaction. The consequence was that in two or three\r\n  years there was no margin or profit. In order to overcome that we\r\n  commenced speculating, in the hope that there would be a change some\r\n  time or other for the better. We did not like the idea of giving up\r\n  the ship. Now, during these times the Standard Oil Company increased\r\n  so perceptibly and so strong that we at once recognised it as the\r\n  element. Instead of looking to the railroad I always looked to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company. In 1874 I went to see Rockefeller to find if\r\n  we could make arrangements with him by which we could run a portion\r\n  of our works. It was a very brief interview. He said there was no\r\n  hope for us at all. He remarked this—I cannot give the exact\r\n  quotation—‘There is no hope for us,’ and probably he said, ‘There is\r\n  no hope for any of us’; but he says, ‘The weakest must go first.’\r\n  And we went.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAll over the country the refineries in the same condition as Mr. Tack’s\r\nfirm sold or leased. Those who felt the hard times and had any hope of\r\nweathering them resisted at first. With many of them the resistance was\r\ndue simply to their love for their business and their unwillingness to\r\nshare its control with outsiders. The thing which a man has begun, cared\r\nfor, led to a healthy life, from which he has begun to gather fruit,\r\nwhich he knows he can make greater and richer, he loves as he does his\r\nlife. It is one of the fruits of his life. He is jealous of it—wishes\r\nthe honour of it, will not divide it with another. He can suffer heavily\r\nhis own mistakes, learn from them, correct them. He can fight\r\nopposition, bear all—so long as the work is his. There were refiners in\r\n1875 who loved their business in this way. Why one should love an oil\r\nrefinery the outsider may not see; but to the man who had begun with one\r\nstill and had seen it grow by his own energy and intelligence to ten,\r\nwho now sold 500 barrels a day where he once sold five, the refinery was\r\nthe dearest spot on earth save his home. He walked with pride among its\r\nevil-smelling places, watched the processes with eagerness, experimented\r\nwith joy and recounted triumphantly every improvement. To ask such a man\r\nto give up his refinery was to ask him to give up the thing which, after\r\nhis family, meant most in life to him.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Rockefeller this feeling was a weak sentiment. To place love of\r\nindependent work above love of profits was as incomprehensible to him as\r\na refusal to accept a rebate because it was _wrong_! Where persuasion\r\nfailed then, it was necessary, in his judgment, that pressure be\r\napplied—simply a pressure sufficient to demonstrate to these blind or\r\nrecalcitrant individuals the impossibility of their long being able to\r\ndo business independently. It was a pressure varied according to\r\nlocality. Usually it took the form of cutting their market. The system\r\nof “predatory competition” was no invention of the Standard Oil Company.\r\nIt had prevailed in the oil business from the start. Indeed, it was one\r\nof the evils Mr. Rockefeller claimed his combination would cure, but\r\nuntil now it had been used spasmodically. Mr. Rockefeller never did\r\nanything spasmodically. He applied underselling for destroying his\r\nrivals’ market with the same deliberation and persistency that\r\ncharacterised all his efforts, and in the long run he always won. There\r\nwere other forms of pressure. Sometimes the independents found it\r\nimpossible to get oil; again, they were obliged to wait days for cars to\r\nship in; there seemed to be no end to the ways of making it hard for men\r\nto do business, of discouraging them until they would sell or lease, and\r\nalways at the psychological moment a purchaser was at their side. Take\r\nas an example the case of the Harkness refinery in Philadelphia, a story\r\ntold to the same committee as that of Mr. Tack:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I was the originator of the enterprise,” said William W. Harkness,\r\n  “believing that there was no better place than Philadelphia to\r\n  refine oil, particularly for export. We commenced then, as near as I\r\n  can now recollect, about 1870, and we made money up to probably\r\n  1874. We managed our business very close and did not speculate in\r\n  oil. We bought and we sold, and we paid a great deal of attention to\r\n  the statistical part of our business so as to save waste, and we did\r\n  a nice business. But we found in some years that probably five\r\n  months out of a year we could not sell our oil unless it would be at\r\n  a positive loss, and then we stopped. Then when we could sell our\r\n  oil, we found a difficulty about getting cars. My brother would\r\n  complain of it, but I believed that the time would come when that\r\n  would be equalised. I had no idea of the iniquity that was going on;\r\n  I could not conceive it. I went on in good faith until about 1874,\r\n  and then the trouble commenced. We could not get our oil and were\r\n  compelled to sell at a loss. Then Warden, Frew and Company formed\r\n  some kind of running arrangement where they supplied the crude, and\r\n  we seemed to get along a little better. After a while the business\r\n  got complicated, and I got tired and handed it over to my brother; I\r\n  backed out. That was about 1875. I was dissatisfied and wanted to do\r\n  an independent business, or else I wanted to give it up. In 1876—I\r\n  recollect that very well, because it was the year of the Centennial\r\n  Exposition—we were at the Centennial Exposition. I was sitting in\r\n  front of the great Corliss engine, admiring it, and he told me there\r\n  was a good opportunity to get out. Warden, Frew and Company, he\r\n  said, were prepared to buy us out, and I asked him whether he\r\n  considered that as the best thing to do; whether we had not better\r\n  hold on and fight it through, for I believed that these difficulties\r\n  would not continue; that we would get our oil. I knew he was a\r\n  competent refiner, and I wanted to continue business, but he said he\r\n  thought he had better make this arrangement, and I consented, and we\r\n  sold out; we got our investment back.”[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere we have a refiner discouraged by the conditions which Mr.\r\nRockefeller claims his aggregation will cure. Under the Rutter circular\r\nand the discrimination in freight to the Standard which followed, his\r\ndifficulty in getting oil increases, and he consents to a running\r\narrangement with Mr. Rockefeller’s partner in Philadelphia, but he wants\r\nto do an “independent business.” Impossible. As he sits watching the\r\nsmooth and terrible power of that famous Corliss engine of 1876, an\r\nengine which showed to thousands for the first time what great power\r\nproperly directed means, he realised that something very like it was at\r\nwork in the oil business—something resistless, silent, perfect in its\r\nmight—and he sold out to that something. Everywhere men did the same.\r\nThe history of oil refining on Oil Creek from 1875 to 1879 is almost\r\nuncanny. There were at the beginning of that period twenty-seven plants\r\nin the region, most of which were in a fair condition, considering the\r\ndifficulties in the business. During 1873 the demand for refined oil had\r\ngreatly increased, the exports nearly doubling over those of 1872. The\r\naverage profit on refined that year in a well-managed refinery was not\r\nless than three cents a gallon. During the first half of 1874 the oil\r\nbusiness had been depressed, but the oil refiners were looking for\r\nbetter times when the Rutter circular completely demoralised them by\r\nputting fifty cents extra freight charges on their shipments without an\r\nequivalent raise on competitive points. It was not only this extra\r\ncharge, enough to cut off their profits, as business then stood, but it\r\nwas that the same set of men who had thrown their business into\r\nconfusion in 1872 was again at work. The announcement of the Central\r\nAssociation with Mr. Rockefeller’s name at its head confirmed their\r\nfears. Nevertheless at first none of the small refiners would listen to\r\nthe proposition to sell or lease made them in the spring of 1875 by the\r\nrepresentative first sent out by the Central Association. They would\r\nhave nothing to do, they said bluntly, with any combination engineered\r\nby John D. Rockefeller. The representative withdrew and the case was\r\nconsidered. In the mean time conditions on the creek grew harder. All\r\nsorts of difficulties began to be strewn in their way—cars were hard to\r\nget, the markets they had built up were cut under them—a demoralising\r\nconviction was abroad in the trade that this new and mysterious\r\ncombination was going to succeed; that it was doing rapidly what its\r\nmembers were reported to be saying daily: “We mean to secure the entire\r\nrefining business of the world.” Such was the state of things on the\r\ncreek when in the early fall of 1875 an energetic young refiner and oil\r\nbuyer well known in the Oil Regions, J. D. Archbold, appeared in\r\nTitusville as the representative of a new company, the Acme Oil Company,\r\na concern which everybody believed to be an offshoot of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Cleveland, though nobody could prove it. As a matter of fact\r\nthe Acme was capitalised and controlled entirely by Standard men, its\r\nstockholders being, in addition to Mr. Archbold, William Rockefeller,\r\nWilliam G. Warden, Frank Q. Barstow, and Charles Pratt. It was evident\r\nat once that the Acme Oil Company had come into the Oil Regions for the\r\npurpose of absorbing the independent interests as Mr. Rockefeller and\r\nhis colleagues were absorbing them elsewhere. The work was done with a\r\npromptness and despatch which do great credit to the energy and\r\nresourcefulness of the engineer of the enterprise. In three years, by\r\n1878, all but two of the refineries of Titusville had “retired from the\r\nbusiness gloriously,” as Mr. Archbold, flushed with victory, told the\r\ncounsel of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1879, when the state\r\nauthorities were trying to find what was at work in the oil interests to\r\ncause such a general collapse. Most of the concerns were bought\r\noutright, the owners being convinced that it was impossible for them to\r\ndo an independent business, and being unwilling to try combination. All\r\ndown the creek the little refineries which for years had faced every\r\ndifficulty with stout hearts collapsed. “Sold out,” “dismantled,” “shut\r\ndown,” is the melancholy record of the industry during these four years.\r\nAt the end practically nothing was left in the Oil Regions but the Acme\r\nof Titusville and the Imperial of Oil City, both of them now under\r\nStandard management. To the oil men this sudden wiping out of the score\r\nof plants with which they had been familiar for years seemed a crime\r\nwhich nothing could justify. Their bitterness of heart was only\r\nintensified by the sight of the idle refiners thrown out of business by\r\nthe sale of their factories. These men had, many of them, handsome sums\r\nto invest, but what were they to put them in? They were refiners, and\r\nthey carried a pledge in their pockets not to go into that business for\r\na period of ten years. Some of them tried the discouraged oil man’s\r\nfatal resource, the market, and as a rule left their money there. One\r\nrefiner who had, according to popular report, received $200,000 for his\r\nbusiness, speculated the entire sum away in less than a year. Others\r\ntried new enterprises, but men of forty learn new trades with\r\ndifficulty, and failure followed many of them. The scars left in the Oil\r\nRegions by the Standard Combination of 1875–1879 are too deep and ugly\r\nfor men and women of this generation to forget them.\r\n\r\nIn Pittsburg the same thing was happening. At the beginning of the work\r\nof absorption—1874—there were between twenty-two and thirty refineries\r\nin the town.[51] As we have seen, Lockhart and Frew sold to the Standard\r\nOil Company of Cleveland some time in 1874. In the fall of that year a\r\nnew company was formed in Pittsburg, called the Standard Oil Company of\r\nPittsburg. Its president was Charles Lockhart; its directors William\r\nFrew, David Bushnell, H. M. Flagler, and W. G. Warden—all members of the\r\nStandard Oil Company and four of them stockholders in the South\r\nImprovement Company. This company at once began to lease or buy\r\nrefineries. Many of the Pittsburg refiners made a valiant fight to get\r\nrates on their oil which would enable them to run independently. To save\r\nexpense they tried to bring oil from the oil fields by barge; the\r\npipe-lines in the pool refused to run oil to barges, the railroad to\r\naccept oil brought down by barge. An independent pipe-line attempted to\r\nbring it to Pittsburg, but to reach the works the pipe-line must run\r\nunder a branch of the Pennsylvania railroad. It refused to permit this,\r\nand for months the oil from the line was hauled in wagons from the point\r\nwhere it had been held up, over the railroad track, and there repiped\r\nand carried to Pittsburg. At every point they met interference until\r\nfinally one by one they gave in. According to Mr. Frew, who in 1879 was\r\nexamined as to the condition of things in Pittsburg, the company began\r\nto “acquire refiners” in 1875. In 1877 they bought their last one; and\r\nat the time Mr. Frew was under examination he could not remember but\r\n_one_ refinery in operation in Pittsburg not controlled by his company.\r\n\r\nNor was it refiners only who sold out. All departments of the trade\r\nbegan to yield to the pressure. There was in the oil business a class of\r\nmen known as shippers. They bought crude oil, sent it East, and sold it\r\nto refineries there. Among the largest of these was Adnah Neyhart, whose\r\nactive representative was W. T. Scheide. Now to Mr. Rockefeller the\r\nindependent shipper was an incubus; he did a business which, in his\r\njudgment, a firm ought to do for itself, and reaped a profit which might\r\ngo direct into the business. Besides, so long as there were shippers to\r\nsupply crude to the Eastern refineries at living prices, so long these\r\nconcerns might resist offers to sell or lease.\r\n\r\nSome time in the fall of 1872 Mr. Scheide began to lose his customers in\r\nNew York. He found that they were making some kind of a working\r\narrangement with the Standard Oil Company, just what he did not know.\r\nBut at all events they no longer bought from him but from the Standard\r\nbuyer, J. A. Bostwick and Company. At the same time he became convinced\r\nthat Mr. Rockefeller was after his business. “I knew that they were\r\nmaking some strenuous efforts to get our business,” he told the Hepburn\r\nCommission in 1879, “because I used to meet Mr. Rockefeller in the Erie\r\noffice.” At the same time that he was facing the loss of customers and\r\nthe demoralising conviction that the Standard Oil Company wanted his\r\nbusiness, he was experiencing more or less disgust over business\r\nconditions in New York. “I did not like the character of my customers\r\nthere,” Mr. Scheide told the committee. “I did not think they were\r\ntreating us fairly and squarely. There was a strong competition in\r\nhandling oil. The competition had got to be so strong that ‘outside\r\nrefiners,’ as they called themselves then, used to go around bidding up\r\nthe price of their works on the Standard Oil Company, and they were\r\nusing me to sell their refineries to the Standard. They would say to\r\nrefiners: ‘Neyhart will do so and so, and we are going to continue\r\nrunning.’ And they would say to us that the Standard was offering lower\r\nprices. I recollect one instance in which they, after having made a\r\ncontract to buy oil from me if I would bring it over the Erie Railway,\r\nbroke that contract for the 1–128th part of a cent a gallon. I sold out\r\nthe next week.” When Mr. Scheide went to the freight agent of the Erie\r\nroad, Mr. Blanchard, and told him of his decision to sell, Mr. Blanchard\r\ntried to dissuade him. During the conversation he let out a fact which\r\nmust have convinced Mr. Scheide more fully than ever that he had been\r\nwise in determining to give up his business. Mr. Blanchard told him as a\r\nreason for his staying and trusting to the Erie road to keep its\r\ncontracts with him that the Standard Oil Company had been offering him\r\nfive cents more a barrel than Mr. Scheide was paying them, and would\r\ntake all their cars, and load them all regularly if they would throw him\r\nover and give them the business. It is interesting to note that when Mr.\r\nScheide sold in the spring of 1875, it was, as he supposed, to Charles\r\nPratt and Company. Well informed as he was in all the intricacies of the\r\nbusiness—and there were few abler or more energetic men in trade at the\r\ntime—he did not know that Charles Pratt and Company had been part and\r\nparcel of the Standard Oil Company since October, 1874.\r\n\r\nOf course securing a large crude shipping business like Mr. Neyhart’s\r\nwas a valuable point for the Standard. It threw all of the refiners whom\r\nhe had supplied out of crude oil and forced several of them to come to\r\nthe Standard buyer—a first step, of course, toward a lease or sale. At\r\nevery point, indeed, making it difficult for the refiner to get his raw\r\nproduct was one of the favourite manœuvres of the combination. It was\r\nnot only to crude oil it was applied. Factories which worked up the\r\nresiduum or tar into lubricating oil and depended on Standard plants for\r\ntheir supply were cut off. There was one such in Cleveland—the firm of\r\nMorehouse and Freeman. Mr. Morehouse had begun to experiment with\r\nlubricating oils in 1861, and in 1871 the report of the Cleveland Board\r\nof Trade devoted several of its pages to a description of his business.\r\nAccording to this account he was then making oils adapted to lubricating\r\nall kinds of machinery—he held patents for several brands and trade\r\nmarks, and had produced that year over 25,000 barrels of different\r\nlubricants besides 120,000 boxes of axle grease. At this time he was\r\nbuying his stock or residuum from one or another of the twenty-five\r\nCleveland refiners. Then came the South Improvement Company and the\r\nconcentration of the town’s refining interest in Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\nhands. Mr. Morehouse, according to the testimony he gave the Hepburn\r\nCommission in 1879, went to Mr. Rockefeller, after the consolidation, to\r\narrange for supplies. He was welcomed—the Standard Oil Company had not\r\nat that time begun to deal in lubricating oils—and encouraged to build a\r\nnew plant. This was done at a cost of $41,000, and a contract was made\r\nwith the Standard Oil Company for a daily supply of eighty-five barrels\r\nof residuum. Some time in 1874 this supply was cut down to twelve\r\nbarrels. The price was put up too, and contracts for several months were\r\ndemanded so that Mr. Morehouse got no advantage from the variation in\r\ncrude prices. Then the freights went up on the railroads. He paid $1.50\r\nand two dollars for what he says he felt sure his big neighbour was\r\npaying but seventy or seventy-five cents (there is no evidence of any\r\nsuch low rate to the Standard from Cleveland to New York by rail). Now\r\nit was impossible for Mr. Morehouse to supply his trade on twelve\r\nbarrels of stock. He begged Mr. Rockefeller for more. It was there in\r\nthe Standard Oil works. Why could he not have it? He could pay for it.\r\nHe and his partner offered to buy 5,000 barrels and store it, but Mr.\r\nRockefeller was firm. All he could give Mr. Morehouse was twelve barrels\r\na day. “I saw readily what that meant,” said Mr. Morehouse, “that meant\r\nsqueeze you out—buy your works. They have got the works and are running\r\nthem; I am without anything. They paid about $15,000 for what cost me\r\n$41,000. He said that he had facilities for freighting and that the\r\ncoal-oil business belonged to them; and any concern that would start in\r\nthat business, they had sufficient money to lay aside a fund to wipe\r\nthem out—these are the words.”[52]\r\n\r\nAt every refining centre in the country this process of consolidation\r\nthrough persuasion, intimidation, or force, went on. As fast as a\r\nrefinery was brought in line its work was assigned to it. If it was an\r\nold and poorly equipped plant it was usually dismantled or shut down. If\r\nit was badly placed, that is, if it was not economically placed in\r\nregard to a pipe-line and railroad, it was dismantled even though in\r\nexcellent condition. If it was a large and well-equipped plant\r\nadvantageously located it was assigned a certain quota to manufacture,\r\nand it did nothing but manufacture. The buying of crude, the making of\r\nfreight rates, the selling of the output remained with Mr. Rockefeller.\r\nThe contracts under which all the refineries brought into line were run\r\nwere of the most detailed and rigid description, and they were executed\r\nas a rule with a secrecy which baffles description. Take, for example, a\r\nrunning arrangement made by Rockefeller in 1876, with a Cleveland\r\nrefinery, that of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle. The members of this\r\nconcern had all been in the refining business in Cleveland in 1872 and\r\nhad all handed over their works to Mr. Rockefeller, when he notified\r\nthem of the South Improvement Company’s contracts. Mr. Shurmer declared\r\nonce in an affidavit that he alone lost $20,000 by that manœuvre. The\r\nmembers of the firm had not stayed out of business, however. Recovering\r\nfrom the panic caused by the South Improvement Company, they had united\r\nin 1875, building a refinery worth $65,000, with a yearly capacity of\r\n180,000 barrels of crude. On the first year’s business they made\r\n$40,000. Although this was doing well, they were convinced they might do\r\nbetter if they could get as good freight rates as the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, and in the spring of 1876 they brought suit against the Lake\r\nShore and Michigan Southern and the New York Central and Hudson River\r\nRailroads for “unlawful and unjust discrimination, partialities and\r\npreferences made and practised ... in favour of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, enabling the said Standard Oil Company to obtain to a great\r\nextent the monopoly of the oil and naphtha trade of Cleveland.” The suit\r\nwas not carried through at the time. Mr. Rockefeller seems to have\r\nsuggested a surer way to the firm of getting the rates they wanted. This\r\nwas to make a running arrangement with him. He seems to have\r\ndemonstrated to them that they could make more money under his plan than\r\noutside, and they signed a contract for a remarkable “joint adventure.”\r\nAccording to this document Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle put into the\r\nbusiness a plant worth at that time about $73,000 and their entire time.\r\nMr. Rockefeller put in $10,000 and his rebates! That is, he secured for\r\nthe firm the same preferential rates on their shipments that the\r\nStandard Oil Company enjoyed. The firm bound itself not to refine over\r\n85,000 barrels a year and neither jointly nor separately to engage in\r\nany other form of oil business for ten years—the life of the contract.\r\nScofield, Shurmer and Teagle were guaranteed a profit of $35,000 a year.\r\nProfits over $35,000 went to Mr. Rockefeller up to $70,000; any further\r\nprofits were divided.\r\n\r\nThe making of this contract and its execution were attended by all the\r\nsecret rites peculiar to Mr. Rockefeller’s business ventures. According\r\nto the testimony of one of the firm given a few years later on the\r\nwitness stand in Cleveland the contract was signed at night at Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s house on Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, where he told the\r\ngentlemen that they must not tell even their wives about the new\r\narrangement, that if they made money they must conceal it—they were not\r\nto drive fast horses, “put on style,” or do anything to let people\r\nsuspect there were unusual profits in oil refining. That would invite\r\ncompetition. They were told that all accounts were to be kept secret.\r\nFictitious names were to be used in corresponding, and a special box at\r\nthe post-office was employed for these fictitious characters. In fact,\r\nsmugglers and house-breakers never surrounded their operations with more\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nBut make his operations as thickly as he might in secrecy, the effect of\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s steady and united attack on the refining business was\r\ndaily becoming more apparent. Before the end of 1876 the alarm among oil\r\nproducers, the few independent refineries still in business, and even in\r\ncertain railroad circles was serious. On all sides talk of a united\r\neffort to meet the consolidation was heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER SIX\r\n                     STRENGTHENING THE FOUNDATIONS\r\n\r\n  FIRST INTERSTATE COMMERCE BILL—THE BILL PIGEON-HOLED THROUGH EFFORTS\r\n    OF STANDARD’S FRIENDS—INDEPENDENTS SEEK RELIEF BY PROPOSED\r\n    CONSTRUCTION OF PIPE-LINES—PLANS FOR THE FIRST SEABOARD\r\n    PIPE-LINE—SCHEME FAILS ON ACCOUNT OF MISMANAGEMENT AND STANDARD AND\r\n    RAILROAD OPPOSITION—DEVELOPMENT OF THE EMPIRE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY\r\n    AND ITS PROPOSED CONNECTION WITH THE REFINING BUSINESS—STANDARD,\r\n    ERIE AND CENTRAL FIGHT THE EMPIRE TRANSPORTATION COMPANY AND ITS\r\n    BACKER, THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD—THE PENNSYLVANIA FINALLY QUITS\r\n    AFTER A BITTER AND COSTLY WAR—EMPIRE LINE SOLD TO THE\r\n    STANDARD—ENTIRE PIPE-LINE SYSTEM OF OIL REGIONS NOW IN ROCKEFELLER’S\r\n    HANDS—NEW RAILROAD POOL BETWEEN FOUR ROADS—ROCKEFELLER PUTS INTO\r\n    OPERATION SYSTEM OF DRAWBACKS ON OTHER PEOPLE’S SHIPMENTS—HE\r\n    PROCEEDS RAPIDLY WITH THE WORK OF ABSORBING RIVALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time the Central Association announced itself, independent\r\nrefiners and the producers as a body watched developments with\r\nsuspicion. They had little to go on. They had no means of proving what\r\nwas actually the fact that the Central Association was the Standard Oil\r\nCompany working secretly to bring its competitors under control or drive\r\nthem out of business. They had no way of knowing what was actually the\r\nfact that the Standard had contracts with the Central, Erie and the\r\nPennsylvania which gave them rebates on the lowest tariff which others\r\npaid. That this must be the case, however, they were convinced, and they\r\ndetermined early in 1876 to call on Congress for another investigation.\r\nA hearing was practically insured, for Congress since 1872 had given\r\nserious attention to the transportation troubles. The Windom Committee\r\nof 1874 had made a report, the sweeping recommendations of which gave\r\nmuch encouragement to those who suffered from the practices of the\r\nrailroads. Among other things this committee recommended that all rates,\r\ndrawbacks, etc., be published at every point and no changes allowed in\r\nthem without proper notification. It recommended the Bureau of Commerce\r\nwhich, in 1902, twenty-eight years later, was created. So serious did\r\nthe Windom Committee consider the situation in 1874, that it made the\r\nfollowing radical recommendations:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The only means of securing and maintaining reliable and effective\r\n  competition between railways is through national or state ownership,\r\n  or control of one or more lines which, being unable to enter into\r\n  combinations, will serve as a regulation of other lines.\r\n\r\n  One or more double-track freight-railways honestly and thoroughly\r\n  constructed, owned or controlled by the government, and operated at\r\n  a low rate of speed, would doubtless be able to carry at a much less\r\n  cost than can be done under the present system of operating fast and\r\n  slow trains on the same road; and, being incapable of entering into\r\n  combinations, would no doubt serve as a very valuable regulator of\r\n  existing railroads within the range of their influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Congress in such a temper the oil men felt that there might be some\r\nhope of securing the regulation of interstate commerce they had asked\r\nfor in 1872. The agitation resulted in the presentation in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in April, of the first Interstate Commerce Bill which\r\npromised to be effective. The bill was presented by James H. Hopkins of\r\nPittsburg. Mr. Hopkins had before his eyes the uncanny fate of the\r\nindependent oil interests of Pittsburg, some twenty-five factories in\r\nthat town having been reduced to two or three in three and one-half\r\nyears. He had seen the oil-refining business of the state steadily\r\nreduced, and he thought it high time that something was done. In aid of\r\nhis bill a House investigation was asked. It was soon evident that the\r\nStandard was an enemy of this investigation. Through the efforts of a\r\ngood friend of the organisation—Congressman H. B. Payne, of\r\nCleveland—the matter was referred to the Committee on Commerce, where a\r\nmember of the house, J. N. Camden, whose refinery, the Camden\r\nConsolidated Oil Company, if it had not already gone, soon after went\r\ninto the Standard Oil Alliance, appeared as adviser of the chairman! Now\r\nwhat Mr. Hopkins wanted was to compel the railroads to present their\r\ncontracts with the Standard Oil Company. The Committee summoned the\r\nproper railroad officers, Messrs. Cassatt, Devereux and Rutter, and O.\r\nH. Payne, treasurer of the Standard Oil Company. Of the railroad men,\r\nonly Mr. Cassatt appeared, and he refused to answer the questions asked\r\nor to furnish the documents demanded. Mr. Payne refused also to furnish\r\nthe committee with information. The two principal witnesses of the oil\r\nmen were E. G. Patterson of Titusville, to whose energy the\r\ninvestigation was largely due, and Frank Rockefeller of Cleveland, a\r\nbrother of John D. Rockefeller. Mr. Patterson sketched the history of\r\nthe oil business since the South Improvement Company identified the\r\nStandard Oil Company with that organisation, and framed the specific\r\ncomplaint of the oil men, as follows: “The railroad companies have\r\ncombined with an organisation of individuals known as the Standard Ring;\r\nthey give to that party the sole and entire control of all the petroleum\r\nrefining interest and petroleum shipping interest in the United States,\r\nand consequently place the whole producing interest entirely at their\r\nmercy. If they succeed they place the price of refined oil as high as\r\nthey please. It is simply optional with them how much to give us for\r\nwhat we produce.”\r\n\r\nFrank Rockefeller gave a pretty complete story of the trials of an\r\nindependent refiner in Cleveland during the preceding four years. His\r\ntestimony in regard to the South Improvement Company has already been\r\nquoted. He declared that at the moment, his concern, the Pioneer Oil\r\nCompany, was unable to get the same rates as the Standard; the freight\r\nagent frankly told him that unless he could give the road the same\r\namount of oil to transport that the Standard did he could not give the\r\nrate the Standard enjoyed. Mr. Rockefeller said that in his belief there\r\nwas a pooling arrangement between the railroads and the Standard and\r\nthat the rebate given was “divided up between the Standard Oil Company\r\nand the railroad officials.” He repeatedly declared to the committee\r\nthat he did not know this to be a positive fact, that he had no proof,\r\nbut that he believed such was the truth. Among the railroad officials\r\nwhom he mentioned as in his opinion enjoying spoils were W. H.\r\nVanderbilt, Thomas Scott and General Devereux. Of course the newspapers\r\nhad it that he had sworn that such was the fact. Colonel Scott promptly\r\nwired the following denial:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The papers of this morning publish that a man named Rockefeller\r\n  stated before your committee that myself and other officers of this\r\n  company were participants in rebates made to the Standard Oil\r\n  Company. So far as the statement relates to myself and the officers\r\n  of this company it is unqualifiedly false, and I have to ask that\r\n  you will summon the officers of the Standard Oil Company, or any\r\n  other parties that may have any knowledge of that subject, in order\r\n  that such villainous and unwarranted statements may be corrected.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Devereux published in the Cleveland press an equally emphatic\r\ndenial. Although Mr. Rockefeller promptly declared that he had stated to\r\nthe committee that he had no personal knowledge that there was such a\r\npool as he had intimated between the railroad men and the Standard, that\r\nhe had only given his suspicions, there were plenty of people to\r\noverlook his explanation and assert that he had given proof of such a\r\ndivision of spoils. The belief spread and is met even to-day in oil\r\ncircles. Now the only basis for any such assertion was the fact that W.\r\nH. Vanderbilt, Peter H. Watson and Amasa Stone were at that time, 1876,\r\nstockholders in the Standard Oil Company. There is no evidence of which\r\nthe writer knows that General Devereux or Colonel Scott ever held any\r\nstock in the concern. Indeed, in 1879, when A. J. Cassatt was under\r\nexamination as to the relations of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the\r\nStandard Oil Company, his own lawyer took pains to question him on this\r\npoint—an effort, no doubt, to silence the accusation which at that date\r\nwas constantly repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Cassatt,” Mr. MacVeagh said, “I want to direct your attention\r\n  to a personal matter which was asked you to a certain extent. You\r\n  were asked whether you had any knowledge that Mr. Vanderbilt,\r\n  representing the New York Central, or Mr. Jewett, representing the\r\n  Erie, had any interest whatever in the Standard Oil Company or any\r\n  of its affiliated companies. I wish to extend that question to the\r\n  other trunk lines. I wish you would state whether or not to your\r\n  knowledge Mr. Garrett, or anybody representing the Baltimore and\r\n  Ohio, had any such interest?”\r\n\r\n  “They have not to my knowledge.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Then I wish you would state whether Mr. Scott or yourself, or any\r\n  other officers of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, had any such\r\n  interest?”\r\n\r\n  “Never to my knowledge. I speak of absolute knowledge as to myself,\r\n  but as to Mr. Scott to the best of my knowledge and belief.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course after this controversy the railroads were more obdurate than\r\never. Mr. Payne and Mr. Camden were active, too, in securing the\r\nsuppression of the investigations and they soon succeeded not only in\r\ndoing that but in pigeon-holing for the time Mr. Hopkins’s Interstate\r\nCommerce Bill.\r\n\r\nBut the oil men had not been trusting entirely to Congressional relief.\r\nFrom the time that they became convinced that the railroads meant to\r\nstand by the terms of the “Rutter Circular” they began to seek an\r\nindependent outlet to the sea. The first project to attract attention\r\nwas the Columbia Conduit Pipe Line. This line was begun by one of the\r\npicturesque characters of Western Pennsylvania, “Dr.” David Hostetter,\r\nthe maker of the famous Hostetter’s Bitters. Dr. Hostetter’s Bitters’\r\nheadquarters were in Pittsburg. He had become interested in oil there,\r\nand had made investments in Butler County. In 1874 he found himself\r\nhampered in disposing of his oil and conceived the idea of piping it to\r\nPittsburg, where he could make a connection with the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nroad, which up to this time had refused to go into the oil pool. Now at\r\nthat time the right of eminent domain for pipes had been granted in but\r\neight counties of Western Pennsylvania. Allegheny County, in which\r\nPittsburg is located, was not included in the eight, a restriction which\r\nthe oil men attributed rightly, no doubt, to the influence of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad in the State Legislature. That road could hardly\r\nhave been expected to allow the pipes to go to Pittsburg and connect\r\nwith a rival road if it could help it. Dr. Hostetter succeeded in buying\r\na right of way through the county, however, and laid his pipes within a\r\nfew miles of the city to a point where he had to pass under a branch of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad. The spot chosen was the bed of a stream over\r\nwhich the railroad passed by a bridge. Dr. Hostetter claimed he had\r\nbought the bed of the run and that the railroad owned simply the right\r\nto span the run. He put down his pipes, and the railroad sent a force of\r\narmed men to the spot, tore up the pipes, fortified their position and\r\nprepared to hold the fort. The oil men came down in a body, and, seizing\r\nan opportune moment, got possession of the disputed point. The railroad\r\nhad thirty of them arrested for riot, but was not able to get them\r\ncommitted; it did succeed, however, in preventing the relaying of the\r\npipes and a long litigation over Dr. Hostetter’s right to pass under the\r\nroad ensued. Disgusted with this turn of affairs Dr. Hostetter leased\r\nthe line to three young independent oil men of whom we are to hear more\r\nlater. They were B. D. Benson, David McKelvy and Major Robert E.\r\nHopkins, all of Titusville. Resourceful and determined they built tank\r\nwagons into which the oil from the pipe was run and was carted across\r\nthe tracks on the public highway, turned into storage tanks and again\r\nrepiped and pumped to Pittsburg. They were soon doing a good business.\r\nThe fight to get the Columbia Conduit Line into Pittsburg aroused again\r\nthe agitation in favour of a free pipe-line bill, and early in 1875\r\nbills were presented in both the Senate and House of the state and\r\nbitter and long fights over them followed. It was charged that the bills\r\nwere in the interest of Dr. Hostetter. He wants to transport his blood\r\nbitters cheaply, sneered one opponent! Many petitions for the bill were\r\ncirculated, but there were even stronger remonstrances and the source of\r\nsome of them was suspicious enough; for instance, that of the “Pittsburg\r\nrefiners representing about one-third of the refining capacity of the\r\nPennsylvania district and nearly one-third of the entire capacity now in\r\nbusiness.” As the Pittsburg refiners were nearly all either owned or\r\nleased by the Standard concern, and the few independents had no hope\r\nsave in a free pipe-line, there seems to be no doubt about the origin of\r\nthat remonstrance. Although the bills were strongly supported, they were\r\ndefeated, and the Columbia Conduit Line continued to “break bulk” and\r\ncart its oil over the railroad track.\r\n\r\nAnother route was arranged which for a time promised success. This was\r\nto bring crude oil by barges to Pittsburg, then to carry the refined\r\ndown the Ohio River to Huntington and thence by the Richmond and\r\nChesapeake road to Richmond. This scheme, started in February, was well\r\nunder way by May, and “On to Richmond!” was the cry of the independents.\r\nEverything possible was done to make this attempt fail. An effort was\r\neven made to prevent the barges which came down the Allegheny River from\r\nunloading, and this actually succeeded for some time. There seemed to be\r\nalways some hitch in each one of the channels which the independents\r\ntried, some point at which they could be so harassed that the chance of\r\na living freight rate which they had seen was destroyed.\r\n\r\nSome time in April, 1876, the most ambitious project of all was\r\nannounced. This was a seaboard pipe-line to be run from the Oil Regions\r\nto Baltimore. Up to this time the pipe-lines had been used merely to\r\ngather the oil from the wells and carry it to the railroads. The longest\r\nsingle line in operation was the Columbia Conduit, and it was built\r\nthirty miles long. The idea of pumping oil over the mountains to the sea\r\nwas regarded generally as chimerical. To a trained civil engineer it did\r\nnot, however, present any insuperable obstacles, and in the winter of\r\n1875 and 1876 Henry Harley, whose connection with the Pennsylvania\r\nTransportation Company has already been noted, went to his old chief in\r\nthe Hoosac Tunnel, General Herman Haupt, and laid the scheme before him.\r\nIf it was a feasible idea would General Haupt take charge of the\r\nengineering for the Pennsylvania Transportation Company? At the same\r\ntime Mr. Harley employed General Benjamin Butler to look after the legal\r\nside of such an undertaking. Both General Haupt and General Butler were\r\nenthusiastic over the idea and took hold of the work with a will. It was\r\nnot long before the scheme began to attract serious attention. The\r\nEastern papers in particular took it up. The references to it were, as a\r\nwhole, favourable. It was regarded everywhere as a remarkable\r\nundertaking: “Worthy,” the New York Graphic said, “to be coupled with\r\nthe Brooklyn Bridge, the blowing up of Hell Gate, and the tunnelling of\r\nthe Hudson River.” As General Haupt’s plans show, it was a tremendous\r\nundertaking, for the line would be, when finished, at least 500 miles\r\nlong, and it would be worked by thirty or more tremendous pumps. On July\r\n25 a meeting was held at Parker’s Landing, presenting publicly the\r\nreports of General Haupt and General Butler. The authority and\r\nseriousness of the scheme as set forth at this meeting alarmed the\r\nrailroads. If this seaboard line went through it was farewell to the\r\nrailroad-Standard combination. Oil could be shipped to the seaboard by\r\nit at a cost of 16⅔ cents a barrel, General Haupt estimated. All of the\r\ninterests, little and big, which believed that they would be injured by\r\nthe success of the line, began an attack.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough one of the first points of hostility was General Haupt\r\nhimself. An effort was made to discredit his estimate in order to scare\r\npeople from taking stock. They recalled the Hoosac Tunnel scandal and\r\nthe fact that the General once built a bridge which had tumbled down,\r\nridiculed his estimate of the cost, etc., etc. The “card” in which\r\nGeneral Haupt answered his chief critic, one who signed himself “Vidi,”\r\nwas admirable:\r\n\r\n\r\n                       A CARD FROM GENERAL HAUPT\r\n\r\n  What are the charges that I am requested to “smash”?\r\n\r\n  They are, as I understand them from others, for some I have not\r\n  seen:\r\n\r\n  1. That I once built a bridge that tumbled down.\r\n\r\n  2. That I was connected with the Hoosac Tunnel that cost seventeen\r\n  millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n  3. That my estimates of cost of transportation are ridiculously low\r\n  and unreliable.\r\n\r\n  1. I did design a bridge some twenty years ago, and constructed a\r\n  span near Greenfield, in Massachusetts, which gave way, owing to a\r\n  defective casting, while being tested. The bridge was not finished;\r\n  had not been opened to the public; had not been accepted from the\r\n  contractor, who repaired the damage in such a manner that a\r\n  recurrence of a break would have been impossible. I have built spans\r\n  of bridges and tested them until they broke, to ascertain their\r\n  ultimate strength, but I supposed that this was a matter that\r\n  concerned myself and not the public. If the bridge had been thrown\r\n  open for public use, and an accident had then occurred from\r\n  defective design or material, the engineer might have been\r\n  censurable, but not otherwise. In an experience of nearly forty\r\n  years I have never had a bridge to fail, after being opened for\r\n  travel, or a piece of masonry to give way. No accident occurred even\r\n  upon the temporary military bridges constructed during the war,\r\n  which President Lincoln used to say were built of bean poles and\r\n  corn stalks.\r\n\r\n  2. How about the Hoosac Tunnel?\r\n\r\n  In 1856 I undertook to build the Hoosac Tunnel, at that time\r\n  ridiculed as visionary and utterly impracticable. I carried it on\r\n  until 1862, when its practicability was so fully demonstrated that\r\n  it was considered some discredit to Massachusetts to allow the work\r\n  to proceed under engineers from another state, and honourable\r\n  members of the Legislature declared that Massachusetts had engineers\r\n  as competent as any that could be found in Pennsylvania. The work in\r\n  my hands, as was proved by reports of investigating committees, was\r\n  costing less than $2,000,000, and the trouble then was that the\r\n  margin was considered too large, and that I was making too much\r\n  money on the $2,000,000, which the state had agreed to advance. In\r\n  1862 the state took the work out of my hands and put it under\r\n  control of state commissioners and engineers. The result was that\r\n  instead of getting the Hoosac Tunnel completed for $2,000,000, which\r\n  was amply sufficient in the hands of H. Haupt and Company, it has\r\n  now cost, _under state management_, nearly $17,000,000.\r\n\r\n  I hope this explanation will be considered sufficient to “smash”\r\n  Number 2.\r\n\r\n  3. As to Number 3, the insufficiency of my estimate.\r\n\r\n  The items which enter into such an estimate are pure and simple.\r\n  There has been but one omission, and that is malicious mischief or\r\n  deviltry, and this item is so uncertain that, without a more\r\n  intimate acquaintance with “Vidi” and his supporters, I could not\r\n  undertake to estimate it.\r\n\r\n  I have put coal at five dollars per ton or eighteen cents per\r\n  bushel, now worth five cents at Brady’s and eight at Pittsburg. Is\r\n  not this enough? I have allowed fifty per cent. greater consumption\r\n  at each station than has been estimated by others. I have allowed\r\n  $1,000 a year for each of two engine men at each station. Will\r\n  anyone say this is not sufficient? And I have, to be safe, estimated\r\n  the work down below the results given by any of the ordinary\r\n  hydraulic formula. It would be absurd to tell experienced pipe men\r\n  that oil cannot be pumped fifteen miles under 900 pounds pressure\r\n  through a four–inch pipe with a discharge of 5,000 barrels per day,\r\n  which is all that the estimate is based upon, and it allows\r\n  sixty-five days’ stoppage besides.\r\n\r\n  Please, gentlemen, let me alone. I have had enough of newspaper\r\n  controversy in former years. I am sick of it.\r\n\r\n                                                             H. HAUPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time that General Haupt was attacked the Pennsylvania\r\nTransportation Company was criticised for bad management. A long letter\r\nto the Derrick August 14, 1876, claimed that the company in the past had\r\nbeen mismanaged; that the credit it asked could not be given safely;\r\nthat its management had been such that it had scarcely any business\r\nleft. Indeed this critic claimed that the last pipe-line organised, a\r\nsmall line known as the Keystone, had during the last six months done\r\nalmost double the business of the Pennsylvania. Under the direction of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, it was believed, the Philadelphia papers\r\nbegan to attack the plan. Their claim was that the charters under which\r\nthe Pennsylvania Transportation Company expected to operate would not\r\nallow them to lay such a pipe-line. The opposition became such that the\r\nNew York papers began to take notice of it. The Derrick on September 16,\r\n1876, copies an article from the New York Bulletin in which it is said\r\nthat the railroads and the Standard Oil Company, “now stand in\r\ngladiatorial array, with shields poised and sword ready to deal the\r\ncut.” An opposition began to arise, too, from farmers through whose\r\nproperty an attempt was being made to obtain right of way. In Indiana\r\nand Armstrong counties the farmers complained to the secretary of\r\ninternal affairs, saying that the company had no business to take their\r\nproperty for a pipe-line. One of the common complaints of the farmers’\r\nnewspapers was that leakage from the pipes would spoil the springs of\r\nwater, curdle milk, and burn down barns. The matter assumed such\r\nproportions that the secretary referred it to the attorney-general for a\r\nhearing. In the meantime the Pennsylvania Transportation Company made\r\nthe most strenuous efforts to secure the right of way. A large number of\r\nmen were sent out to talk over the farmers into signing the leases. Hand\r\nbills were distributed with an appeal to be generous and to free the oil\r\nbusiness from a monopoly that was crushing it. These same circulars told\r\nthe farmers that a monopoly had hired agents all along the route\r\nmisrepresenting the facts about their intentions. Mr. Harley, under the\r\nexcitement of the enterprise and the opposition it aroused, became a\r\npublic figure, and in October the New York Graphic gave a long interview\r\nwith him. In this interview Mr. Harley claimed that the pipe-line scheme\r\nwas gotten up to escape the Standard Oil monopoly. Litigation, he\r\ndeclared, was all his scheme had to fear. “John D. Rockefeller,\r\npresident of the Standard monopoly,” he said, “is working against us in\r\nthe country newspapers, prejudicing the farmers and raising issues in\r\nthe courts, and seeking also to embroil us with other carrying lines.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long, however, before something more serious than the farmers\r\nand their complaints got in the way of the Pennsylvania Transportation\r\nCompany. This was a rumour that the company was financially embarrassed.\r\nTheir certificates were refused on the market, and in November a\r\nreceiver was appointed. Different members of the company were arrested\r\nfor fraud, among them two or three of the best known men in the Oil\r\nRegions. The rumours proved only too true. The company had been grossly\r\nmismanaged, and the verification of the charges against it put an end to\r\nthis first scheme for a seaboard pipe-line.\r\n\r\nWhile all these efforts doomed to failure or to but temporary success\r\nwere making, a larger attempt to meet Mr. Rockefeller’s consolidation\r\nwas quietly under way. Among those interested in the oil business who\r\nhad watched the growing power of the Standard with most concern was the\r\nhead of the Empire Transportation Company, Colonel Joseph D. Potts. In\r\nconnection with the Pennsylvania Railroad Colonel Potts had built up\r\nthis concern, founded in 1865, until it was the most perfectly developed\r\noil transporter in the country. It operated 500 miles of pipe, owned a\r\nthousand oil-tank cars, controlled large oil yards at Communipaw, New\r\nJersey, was in every respect indeed a model business organisation, and\r\nit had the satisfaction of knowing that what it was it had made itself\r\nfrom raw material, that its methods were its own, and that the practices\r\nit had developed were those followed by other pipe-line companies. While\r\nthe Empire had far outstripped all its early competitors, there had\r\ngrown up in the last year a rival concern which Colonel Potts must have\r\nwatched with anxiety. This concern, known as the United Pipe Line, was\r\nreally a Standard organisation, for Mr. Rockefeller, in carrying out his\r\nplan of controlling all the oil refineries of the country, had been\r\nforced gradually into the pipe-line business.\r\n\r\nHis first venture seems to have been in 1873. In that year the\r\noil-shipping firm of J. A. Bostwick and Company laid a short pipe in the\r\nLower Field, as the oil country along the Allegheny River was called.\r\nNow J. A. Bostwick was one of the charter members of the South\r\nImprovement Company, and when Mr. Rockefeller enlarged his business in\r\n1872 because of the power that enterprise gave him, he took Mr. Bostwick\r\ninto the Standard. This alliance, like all the operations of that\r\nventure, was secret. The bitterness of the Oil Regions against the\r\nmembers of the South Improvement Company was so great for many months\r\nafter the Oil War that Mr. Bostwick and Mr. Rockefeller seem to have\r\nconcluded in 1873 that it would be a wise precautionary measure for them\r\nto lay a pipe-line upon which they could rely for a supply of oil in\r\ncase the oil men attempted again to cut them off from crude, as they had\r\nsucceeded in doing in 1872. Accordingly, a line was built and put in the\r\ncharge of a man who has since become known as one of the “strong men” of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company. This man, Daniel O’Day, was a young Irishman\r\nwho had first appeared in the oil country in 1867, and had at once made\r\nso good a record for himself as transporting agent, that in 1869, when\r\nthe oil-shipping firm of J. A. Bostwick needed a man to look after its\r\nshipments, he was employed. The record he made in the next two years was\r\nsuch that it reached the ear of Jay Gould himself, the president of the\r\nErie, over which Mr. Bostwick was doing most of his shipping. Now the\r\nErie at this time was making a hard fight to meet the growth of the\r\nEmpire Transportation Company. So important did Jay Gould think this\r\nstruggle that in 1871 he himself came to the Oil Regions to look after\r\nit. One of the first men summoned to his private car as it lay in\r\nTitusville was the young Irishman, O’Day. He came as he was, begrimed\r\nwith the oil of the yards, but Mr. Gould was looking for men who could\r\ndo things, and was big enough to see through the grime. When the\r\ninterview was concluded, Daniel O’Day had convinced Jay Gould that he\r\nwas the man to divert the oil traffic from the Pennsylvania to the Erie\r\nroad, and he walked out with an order in his pocket which lifted him\r\nover the head of everybody on the road so far as that particular freight\r\nwas concerned, for it gave him the right to seize cars wherever he found\r\nthem. For weeks after this he practically lived on the road, turning\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania in this time a large volume of freight, and making\r\nit certain that it would have to look to its laurels as it never had\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe next year after this episode came the Oil War. The anger of the oil\r\nmen was poured out on everyone connected in any way with the\r\nstockholders of the South Improvement Company, and among others on Mr.\r\nO’Day. He knew no more of the South Improvement Company at the start\r\nthan the rest of the region, but he did know that it was his business to\r\ntake care of certain property intrusted to him. Resolutions calling on\r\nhim to resign were passed by oil exchanges and producers’ unions. Mobs\r\nthreatened his cars, his stations, his person, but with the grit of his\r\nrace he hung to his post. There was, perhaps, but one other man in the\r\nemploy of members of the South Improvement Company who showed the same\r\ncourage, and that was Joseph Seep of Titusville. Almost every other\r\nemployee fled, the principals in the miserable business took care to\r\nstay out of the country, but Mr. O’Day and Mr. Seep polished their\r\nshillalahs and stood over their property night and day until the war was\r\nover. Their courage did not go unrewarded. They were made the chief\r\nexecutive representatives, in the region, of the consolidated Standard\r\ninterests which followed the war, though neither of them knew at the\r\ntime that they were in the Standard employ. They supposed that the\r\nshipper Bostwick was an independent concern. It was a man of grit and\r\nforce and energy then who took hold of the Standard’s pipe-line in 1873.\r\nRapid growth went on. The little line with which they started became the\r\nAmerican Transfer Company, gradually extending its pipes to seventy or\r\neighty miles in Clarion County, and in 1875 building lines in the\r\nBradford Field.\r\n\r\nThe American Transfer Company was soon working in harmony with the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines, of which Captain J. J. Vandergrift was the president.\r\nThis system had its nucleus, like all the others of the country, in a\r\nshort private line, built in 1869 by Captain Vandergrift. It had grown\r\nuntil in 1874 it handled thirty per cent. of the oil of the region. Now\r\nin 1872, after the Oil War, Captain Vandergrift had become a convert to\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s theory of the “good of the oil business,” and as we\r\nhave seen, had gone into the National Refiners’ Association as\r\nvice-president. Later he became a director in the Standard Oil Company.\r\nIn 1874 he sold a one-third interest of his great pipe-line system to\r\nStandard men, and the line was reorganised in the interests of that\r\ncompany. That is, the Standard Oil Combination in 1876 was a large\r\ntransporter of oil, for the directors and leading stockholders owned and\r\noperated fully forty per cent. of the pipe-lines of the Oil Regions,\r\nowned all but a very few of the tank cars on both the Central and Erie\r\nroads, and controlled under leases two great oil terminals, those of the\r\nErie and Central roads. It was little wonder that Colonel Potts watched\r\nthis rapid concentration of transportation and refining interests with\r\ndread. It was more dangerous than the single shipper, and he had always\r\nfought that idea on the ground of policy. “In the first place, it\r\nconcentrates great power in the hands of one party over the trade of the\r\nroad,” he told an investigating committee of Congress in 1888. “They can\r\nremove it at pleasure. In the second place I think a large number of\r\nparties engaged in the same trade are very apt to divide themselves into\r\ntwo different classes as to the way of viewing markets; one class will\r\nbe hopeful, and the other the reverse. The result will be there will be\r\nalways one or the other class engaged in shipping some of the\r\ntraffic.... The whole question seems to me to resolve itself into\r\ndetermining what policy will bring the largest volume in the most\r\nregular way to the carrier; and it is my opinion, based upon such\r\nexperience as I have had, that a hundred shippers of a carload a day\r\nwould be sure to give to a carrier a more regular volume of business,\r\nand I think, probably, a larger total volume of business in a year’s\r\ntime than one shipper of a hundred cars a day.”[53]\r\n\r\nHolding this theory, Colonel Potts had opposed the rebate to the\r\nStandard granted by the Pennsylvania in 1875. Three years later he\r\ndescribed in a communication, published anonymously, the effect of the\r\nrebates granted at that time:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The final agreement with the railways was scarcely blotter-dried\r\n  ere stealthy movements toward the whole line of outside refiners\r\n  were evident, although rather felt than seen. As long as\r\n  practicable, they were denied as mere rumours, but as they gradually\r\n  became accomplished victories, as one refiner after another, through\r\n  terror, through lack of skill in ventures, through financial\r\n  weakness, fell shivering with dislike into the embrace of this\r\n  commercial octopus, a sense of dread grew rapidly among those\r\n  independent interests which yet lived, and notably among a portion\r\n  of the railroad transporters.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief “railroad transporter” who shared with the independents the\r\nsense of dread which Mr. Rockefeller’s absorption of refineries awakened\r\nwas Mr. Potts himself. As he saw the independents of Pittsburg,\r\nPhiladelphia, New York and the creek, shutting down, selling out, going\r\ninto bankruptcy, while the Standard and its allies grew bigger day by\r\nday, as he saw the Standard interest developing a system of\r\ntransportation greater than his own, he concluded to prevent, if\r\npossible, the one shipper in the oil business. “We reached the\r\nconclusion,” said Colonel Potts in 1888, “that there were three great\r\ndivisions in the petroleum business—the production, the carriage of it,\r\nand the preparation of it for market. If any one party controlled\r\nabsolutely any one of those three divisions, it practically would have a\r\nvery fair show of controlling the others. We were particularly\r\nsolicitous about the transportation, and we were a little afraid that\r\nthe refiners might combine in a single institution, and some of them\r\nexpressed a strong desire to associate themselves permanently with us.\r\nWe therefore suggested to the Pennsylvania road that we should do what\r\nwe did not wish to do—associate ourselves. That is, our business was\r\ntransportation and nothing else; but, in order that we might reserve a\r\nnucleus of refining capacity to our lines, we suggested we should become\r\ninterested in one or more refineries, and we became interested in two,\r\none in Philadelphia and one in New York. It was incidental merely to our\r\ntransportation. The extreme limit was 4,000 barrels a day only.”\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1876 that the Empire began to interest itself in\r\nrefineries. No sooner did Mr. Rockefeller discover this than he sought\r\nMr. Scott and Mr. Cassatt, then the third vice-president of the\r\nPennsylvania, in charge of transportation. It was not _fair_! Mr.\r\nRockefeller urged. The Empire was a transportation company. If it went\r\ninto the refining business it was not to be expected that it would deal\r\nas generously with rivals as with its own factories; besides, it would\r\ndisturb the one shipper who, they all had agreed, was such a benefit to\r\nthe railroads. Mr. Scott and Mr. Cassatt might have reminded Mr.\r\nRockefeller that he was as truly a transporter as the Empire, but if\r\nthey did they were met with a prompt denial of this now well-known fact.\r\nHe was an oil refiner—only that and nothing more. “They tell us that\r\nthey do not control the United Pipe Lines,” Mr. Cassatt said in his\r\ntestimony in 1879. Besides, urged Mr. Rockefeller, if they have\r\nrefineries of course they will give them better terms than they do us.\r\nMr. Flagler told the Congressional Committee of 1888 that the Standard\r\nwas unable to obtain rates through the Empire Transportation Company\r\nover the Pennsylvania Railroad for the Pittsburg or Philadelphia\r\nrefineries as low as were given by competing roads, and, added he, “from\r\nthe fact that the business during those years _was so very close as to\r\nleave scarcely any margin of profit_ under the most advantageous\r\ncircumstances. And we, finding ourselves undersold in the markets by\r\ncompetitors whom we knew had not the same facilities in the way of\r\nmechanical appliances for doing the business, knew that there was but\r\none conclusion to be reached, and that was that the Empire\r\nTransportation Company favoured certain other shippers, I would say\r\nfavoured its own refineries to our injury.”\r\n\r\nAs the Standard Oil Company paid a dividend of about fourteen per cent.\r\nin both 1875 and 1876, besides spending large sums in increasing its\r\nplants and facilities, the margin of profit cannot have been so low as\r\nit seemed to Mr. Flagler in 1888 to have been; naturally enough, for he\r\nsaw dividends of from fifty to nearly 100 per cent. later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A.

POTTS\r\n\r\n  President of the Empire Transportation Company. Leader in the struggle\r\n    between the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Standard Oil Company in\r\n    1877.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Vanderbilt and Mr. Jewett soon joined their protests to Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s. “The steps it (the Empire) was then taking,” said Mr.\r\nJewett, “unless checked would result in a diversion largely of the\r\ntransportation of oil from our roads; the New York Central road and our\r\nown determined that we ought not to stand by and permit those\r\nimprovements and arrangements to be made which, when completed, would be\r\nbeyond our control.”[54] These protests increased in vehemence, until\r\nfinally the Pennsylvania officials remonstrated with Mr. Potts. “We\r\nendeavoured,” says Mr. Cassatt, “to try to get those difficulties\r\nharmonised, talked of getting the Empire Transportation Company to lease\r\nits refineries to the Standard Oil Company, or put them into other\r\nhands, but we did not succeed in doing that.” “Rather than do that,”\r\nColonel Potts told Mr. Cassatt, when he proposed that the Empire sell\r\nits refineries, “we had rather you would buy us out and close our\r\ncontract with you.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Standard Oil Company and its allies, the Erie and Central,\r\nfound that the Pennsylvania would not or could not drive the Empire from\r\nits position, they determined on war. Mr. Jewett, the Erie president, in\r\nhis testimony of 1879 before the Hepburn Commission, takes the burden of\r\nstarting the fight. “Whether the Standard Oil Company was afraid of the\r\nEmpire Line as a refiner,” he said, “I have no means of knowing. I never\r\npropounded the question. We were opposed to permitting the Empire Line,\r\na creature of the Pennsylvania Railroad, to be building refineries, to\r\nbecome the owners of pipe-lines leading into the oil field and leading\r\nto the coast, without a contest, and we made it without regard to the\r\nStandard Oil Company or anybody else; but when we did determine to make\r\nit, I have no doubt we demanded of the Standard Oil Company during the\r\ncontest to withdraw its shipments from the Pennsylvania.” Mr. Flagler\r\ngave the following version of the affair to the Congressional Committee\r\nof 1888:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  We made an agreement with the Empire Transportation Company for\r\n  shipments over the Pennsylvania Railroad on behalf of the\r\n  Pennsylvania interests, which were then owned by the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, simply because there was no alternative. It was the only\r\n  vehicle by which these Pittsburg refineries and the Philadelphia\r\n  refineries carried their crude oil over the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n  There was no other medium by which business could be done over the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, except through the Empire Transportation\r\n  Company, a subsidiary company of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\r\n  The Empire Transportation Company was not only the owner of\r\n  pipe-lines in the Oil Regions, and tank-cars on the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad, but also of refineries at Philadelphia and New York, and\r\n  to that extent were our competitors. We, _having no interest\r\n  whatever in transportation_,[55] naturally felt jealous of the\r\n  Empire Transportation Company, and drew the attention of the\r\n  northern lines. By that I mean the New York Central and the Erie\r\n  railroads. With the peculiar position of the oil business on the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, their attention was called to this very soon\r\n  after the Empire Transportation Company began the business of\r\n  refining. The position taken by the two Northern trunk lines in\r\n  their intercourse with the Pennsylvania Railroad, as was admitted by\r\n  Mr. Cassatt in his testimony, and stated to me by the\r\n  representatives of the two Northern roads, Mr. Vanderbilt and Mr.\r\n  Jewett, was that it was unfair to them that the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad did not divest itself of the manufacturing business.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacked by the Erie and Central, Mr. Rockefeller, in the spring of 1877,\r\nfinally told Mr. Cassatt that he would no longer send any of his freight\r\nover the Pennsylvania unless the Empire gave up its refineries. The\r\nPennsylvania refused to compel the Empire to this course. According to\r\nMr. Potts’s own story, the road was partially goaded to its decision by\r\na demand for more rebates, which came from Mr. Rockefeller at about the\r\ntime he pronounced his ultimatum on the Empire. “They swooped upon the\r\nrailways,” says Colonel Potts, “with a demand for a vast increase in\r\ntheir rebate. They threatened, they pleaded, it has been said they\r\npurchased—however that may be, they conquered. Minor officials intrusted\r\nwith the vast power of according secret rates conceded all they were\r\nasked to do, even to concealing from their superiors for months the real\r\nnature of their illegal agreements.” Probably it was at this time that\r\nthere took place the little scene between Mr. Vanderbilt and Mr.\r\nRockefeller and his colleagues, of which the former told the Hepburn\r\nCommission in 1879. The Standard people were after more rebates. They\r\naffirmed other roads were giving larger rebates than Mr. Vanderbilt, and\r\nthat their contract with him obliged him to give as much as anybody else\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he told them, “you cannot walk into this office and say we\r\nare bound by any contract to do business with you at any price that any\r\nother road does that is in competition with us; it is only on a fair\r\ncompetitive basis, a fair competition for business at a price that I\r\nconsider will pay the company to do it.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this interview, so rumour says, Mr. Vanderbilt sold the\r\nStandard stock he had acquired as a result of the deals made through the\r\nSouth Improvement Company. “I think they are smarter fellows than I am,\r\na good deal,” he told the commission, somewhat ruefully. “And if you\r\ncome in contact with them I guess you will come to the same conclusion.”\r\n\r\nSpurred on then by resentment at the demands for new rebates, as well as\r\nby the injustice of Mr. Rockefeller’s demand that the Empire give up its\r\nrefineries, the Pennsylvania accepted the Standard’s challenge, resolved\r\nto stand by the Empire, and henceforth to treat all its shippers alike.\r\nNo sooner was its resolution announced in March, 1877, than all the\r\nfreight of the Standard, amounting to fully sixty-five per cent. of the\r\nroad’s oil traffic, was taken away. An exciting situation, one of\r\nout-and-out war, developed, for the Empire at once entered on an\r\nenergetic campaign to make good its loss by developing its own\r\nrefineries, and by forming a loyal support among the independent oil\r\nmen. Day and night the officers worked on their problem, and with\r\ngrowing success. When Mr. Rockefeller saw this he summoned his backers\r\nto action. The Erie and Central began to cut rates to entice away the\r\nindependents. It is a sad reflection on both the honour and the\r\nforesight of the body of oil men who had been crying so loudly for help,\r\nthat as soon as the rates were cut on the Standard lines many of them\r\nbegan to attempt to force the Pennsylvania to follow. “They found the\r\nopportunity for immediate profits by playing one belligerent against the\r\nother too tempting to resist,” says Colonel Potts. “We paid them large\r\nrebates,” said Mr. Cassatt; “in fact, we took anything we could get for\r\ntransporting their oil. In some cases we paid out in rebates more than\r\nthe whole freight. I recollect one instance where we carried oil to New\r\nYork for Mr. Ohlen, or someone he represented, I think at eight cents\r\nless than nothing. I do not say any large quantities, but oil was\r\ncarried at that rate.”\r\n\r\nWhile the railroads were waging this costly war the Standard was\r\ncarrying the fight into the refined market. The Empire had gone\r\nsystematically to work to develop markets for the output of its own and\r\nof the independent refineries. Mr. Rockefeller’s business was to prevent\r\nany such development. He was well equipped for the task by his system of\r\n“predatory competition,” for in spite of the fact that Mr. Rockefeller\r\nclaimed that underselling to drive a rival from a market was one of the\r\nevils he was called to cure, he did not hesitate to employ it himself.\r\nIndeed, he had long used his freedom to sell at any price he wished for\r\nthe sake of driving a competitor out of the market with calculation and\r\ninfinite patience. Other refiners burst into the market and undersold\r\nfor a day; but when Mr. Rockefeller began to undersell, he kept it up\r\nday in and day out, week in and week out, month in and month out, until\r\nthere was literally nothing left of his competitor. A former official of\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company, who in 1877 took an active part in\r\nthe war his company was waging against the Standard, once told the\r\nwriter that in every town, North or South, East or West, in which they\r\nalready had a market for their refined oil, or attempted to make one,\r\nthey found a Standard agent on hand ready to undersell. The Empire was\r\nnot slow in underselling. It is very probable that in many cases it\r\nbegan it, for, as Mr. Cassatt says, “They endeavoured to injure us and\r\nour shippers all they could in that fight, and we did the same thing.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the growing bitterness and cost of the contest, the Empire\r\nhad no thought of yielding. Mr. Potts’s hope was in a firm alliance with\r\nthe independent oil men, many of the strongest of whom were rallying to\r\nhis side. At the beginning of the fight he had very shrewdly enlisted in\r\nhis plan one of the largest independent producers of the day, B. B.\r\nCampbell, of Butler. “Being a pleasure and a duty to me,” says Mr.\r\nCampbell, “I entered into the service with all the zeal and power that I\r\nhave. I made a contract with the Empire Line wherein I bound myself to\r\ngive all my business to this line.” At the same time Mr. Potts sought\r\nthe help of the man who was generally accepted as the coolest, most\r\nintelligent, and trustworthy adviser in matters of transportation the\r\nOil Regions had, E. G. Patterson, of Titusville. Mr. Patterson was a\r\npractical railroad man, and an able and logical opponent of the rebate\r\nand “one shipper” systems. He had been prominent in the fight against\r\nthe South Improvement Company, and since that time he had persistently\r\nurged the independents to wage war only on the practice of rebates—to\r\nrefuse them themselves and to hold the railroads strictly to their duty\r\nin the matter. Several conferences were held, and finally, in the early\r\nsummer, Mr. Potts read the two gentlemen a paper he had drawn up as a\r\ncontract between the producers and the Empire. It speaks well for the\r\nfair-mindedness of Mr. Potts that when he read this document to Mr.\r\nCampbell and Mr. Patterson, both of whom were skilled in the ways of the\r\ntransporter, they “accepted it in a moment.”\r\n\r\n“It was made the duty of Mr. Patterson and myself to get signatures of\r\nproducers to this agreement,” says Mr. Campbell, “in a sufficient amount\r\nto warrant the Pennsylvania road entering into a permanent agreement.\r\nThe contract, I think, was for three years.” The attempt to enlist a\r\nsolid body of oil men in the scheme was at once set on foot, but hardly\r\nwas it under way before troubles of most serious import came upon the\r\nPennsylvania road. A great and general strike on all its branches tied\r\nup its traffic for weeks. In Pittsburg hundreds of thousands of dollars’\r\nworth of property were destroyed by a mob of railroad employees. It is\r\nnot too much to say that in these troubles the Pennsylvania lost\r\nmillions of dollars; it is certain that as a result of them the company\r\nthat fall and the coming spring had to pass its dividends for the first\r\ntime since it commenced paying them, and that its stock fell to\r\ntwenty-seven dollars a share (par being fifty dollars). Overwhelmed by\r\nthe disasters, Mr. Scott and Mr. Cassatt felt that they could not afford\r\nany longer to sustain the Empire in its fight for the right to refine as\r\nwell as transport oil.\r\n\r\nWhile the coffers of the Pennsylvania were empty, those of the Standard\r\nwere literally bursting with profits; for the Standard, the winter\r\nbefore this fight came on, had carried to completion for the first time\r\nthe work which it had been organised to accomplish, that is, it had put\r\nup the price of refined oil, in defiance of all laws of supply and\r\ndemand, and held it up for nearly six months. The story of this dramatic\r\ncommercial hold-up is told in the next chapter; it is enough for present\r\npurposes to say that in the winter of 1876–1877 millions of gallons of\r\noil were sold by Mr. Rockefeller and his partners at a profit of from\r\nfifteen to twenty-five cents a gallon. The curious can compute the\r\nprofits; they certainly ran into the multi-millions. A dividend of fifty\r\nper cent. was paid for the year following the scoop, and “there was\r\nplenty of money made to throw that dividend out twice over and make a\r\nprofit,” Samuel Andrews, one of the Standard’s leading men, told an Ohio\r\ninvestigating committee in 1879. The Standard then had a war budget big\r\nenough for any opposition, and it is not to be wondered at that the\r\nPennsylvania, knowing this and finding its own treasury depleted, was\r\nready to quit.\r\n\r\nIt was August when Mr. Scott and Mr. Cassatt decided to give up the\r\nfight. Peace negotiations were at once instituted, Mr. Cassatt going to\r\nCleveland to see Messrs. Rockefeller and Flagler, and Mr. Warden, who\r\nwas visiting them there. Later, the same gentlemen met Mr. Scott and Mr.\r\nCassatt at the St. George Hotel, in Philadelphia. “The subject of\r\ndiscussion at these meetings,” said Mr. Cassatt in 1879, when under\r\nexamination, “was whether we could not make some contract or agreement\r\nwith the Standard Oil Company by which this contest would cease. They\r\ninsisted that the first condition of their coming back on our line to\r\nship over our road must be that the Empire Transportation Company, which\r\ncompany represented us in the oil business, must cease the refining of\r\noil in competition with them. The Empire Transportation Company objected\r\nto going out of the refining business.” The result of this objection\r\nColonel Potts stated in 1888: “Our contract with the Pennsylvania road\r\ngave to them the option, at any time they saw proper, upon reasonable\r\nnotice, of buying our entire plant; they exercised that option.” “Was\r\nthat at your request or desire?” the chairman asked the Colonel. “No,\r\nsir. It was at the request of the Pennsylvania road through their\r\nofficials.” The question then came up as to who should buy the plant of\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company. “The Standard wanted us to do so,”\r\nsays Mr. Cassatt. “They wanted us to buy the pipe-lines and cars; we\r\nobjected to buying the pipe-lines, and it resulted in their buying them\r\nand the refining plants. The negotiations were carried on in\r\nPhiladelphia, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Flagler mainly representing the\r\nStandard. A substantial agreement was reached about the last of October.\r\nThe agreement would have been probably perfected about that time except\r\nthat the counsel for the Empire Line thought it was necessary that they\r\nshould advertise the fact that they were going to sell their property,\r\nand have a meeting of their stockholders, and get their assent to the\r\nsale before the papers were finally signed.”\r\n\r\nThis meeting of which Mr. Cassatt speaks was held on October 17. Colonel\r\nPotts made a statement to the stockholders, which he began by a brief\r\nreview of the growth of the company from the point when twelve years\r\nbefore it had started as a new route charged with the duty of meeting\r\nformidable competitors. He pointed out that at the close of the twelfth\r\nyear the company was the owner of a large fleet of lake vessels, of\r\nelevators and docks at the City of Erie, of improved piers in New York\r\nCity, of nearly 5,000 cars, of over 500 miles of pipe-lines, of valuable\r\ninterests in refineries, of all the appliances of a great business. In\r\nthese twelve years, Colonel Potts told his stockholders, the\r\norganisation had collected more than one hundred million dollars, and in\r\nthe last year their cars had moved over 30,000 miles of railway. He\r\nexplained to the stockholders the condition of the oil business which\r\nhad made it necessary, in his judgment, for the Empire Transportation\r\nCompany to go into the refining business. It was done with the greatest\r\nreluctance, Colonel Potts declared, but it was done because he and his\r\ncolleagues believed that there was no other way for them to save to the\r\nPennsylvania road permanently the proportion of the oil traffic which\r\nthey had acquired in the twelve years in which they had been in\r\nbusiness. He reviewed, dispassionately, the circumstances which had led\r\nthe Pennsylvania road to ask the company to give up its refineries. He\r\nstated his reasons for deciding that it was wiser for the Empire to\r\nresign its contracts with the Pennsylvania and go into liquidation than\r\nto submit to the demands of the Standard interests. Colonel Potts\r\nfollowed his statement by an abstract of the agreements which had been\r\nmade between the Standard people and the Empire. By these agreements the\r\nStandard Oil Company bought of the Empire Transportation Company their\r\npipe-line interest for the sum of $1,094,805.56, their refining\r\ninterests in New York and Philadelphia for the sum of $501,652.78,\r\n$900,000 worth of Oil Tank Car Trust, and they also settled with outside\r\nrefiners and paid for personal property to the extent of $900,000 more,\r\nmaking a total cash payment of $3,400,000. Two millions and a half of\r\nthis money, Colonel Potts told the stockholders, would be paid that\r\nevening by certified checks if the agreements were ratified. “Not\r\nknowing what your action might be at this meeting,” he concluded, “we\r\nare still in active business. We could not venture to do anything that\r\nwould check our trade, that would repel customers, that would drive any\r\nof them away from us. We must be prepared if you said no to go right\r\nalong with our full machinery under our contract, or under such\r\nmodification of that as we could fight through. We could not stop moving\r\na barrel of oil. We must be ready to take any offered to us; we must\r\nsupply parties taking oil. There was nothing we could do but what was\r\ndone; nothing was stopped, nothing is stopped, everything is going on\r\njust as vigorously at this moment through as wide an extent of country\r\nas ever it did, and it will continue to do so until after you take\r\naction, until after we get these securities or the money. That, we\r\nsuppose, will be about six o’clock to-day, if you act favourably, and at\r\nthat time we shall, if everything goes through, telegraph to every man\r\nin our service, and to the heads of departments what has been done, and\r\nat twelve o’clock to-night we shall cease to operate anything in the\r\nEmpire Transportation Company.”\r\n\r\nThe stockholders accepted the proposition, and that night at Colonel\r\nPotts’s office on Girard Street, Philadelphia, Mr. Scott and Mr.\r\nCassatt, of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Colonel Potts and two of his\r\ncolleagues in the Empire, and two of the refiners with whom he was\r\naffiliated, met William Rockefeller, Mr. Flagler, Mr. Warden, Mr.\r\nLockhart, Charles Pratt, Jabez A. Bostwick, Daniel O’Day, and J. J.\r\nVandergrift, and their counsel, and the papers and checks were signed\r\nand passed, wiping out of existence a great business to which a body of\r\nthe best transportation men the state of Pennsylvania has produced had\r\ngiven twelve years of their lives. After the meeting was over, there\r\nwere sent out from Philadelphia to scores of employees of the Empire\r\nTransportation Company scattered throughout the state, telegrams stating\r\nthat at twelve o’clock that night the company would cease to exist. For\r\ntwelve years the organisation had been doing a growing business. On the\r\ndate of this telegram its operations were more extensive, its\r\nopportunities more promising, under fair play, than they had ever been\r\nbefore in its history. The band of men who had built it up to such\r\nhealthy success were not giving it up because they had lost faith in it,\r\nor because they believed there were larger opportunities for them in\r\nsome other business; they were giving it up because they were compelled\r\nto, and probably men never went out of business in this country with a\r\ndeeper feeling of injustice than that of the officials of the Empire\r\nTransportation Company on October 17, 1877, when they sent out the\r\ntelegrams which put their great creation into liquidation.\r\n\r\nThe pipe-lines thus acquired were at once consolidated with the other\r\nStandard lines. Only a few independent lines, and only one of these of\r\nimportance—the Columbia Conduit—now remained in the Oil Regions. This\r\ncompany had been doing business, since 1875, under the difficulties\r\nalready described. Dr. Hostetter, the chief stockholder, had become\r\nheartily sick of the oil business and wanted to sell. He had approached\r\nthe Empire Line, and there had been some negotiations. Then came the\r\nfall of the Empire and Dr. Hostetter sought the United Pipe Line. Intent\r\non stopping every outlet of oil not under their control the Standard\r\npeople bought the Columbia Conduit. By the end of the year the entire\r\npipe-line system of the Oil Regions was in Mr. Rockefeller’s hands. He\r\nwas the only oil gatherer. Practically not a barrel of oil could get to\r\na railroad without his consent. He had set out to be simply the only oil\r\nrefiner in the country, but to achieve that purpose he had been obliged\r\nto make himself an oil transporter. In such unforeseen paths do great\r\nambitions lead men!\r\n\r\nThe first effect of the downfall of the Empire was a new railroad pool.\r\nIndeed when it became evident that the Pennsylvania would yield, the\r\nErie, Central and the Standard had begun preparing a new adjustment, and\r\nthe papers for this were ready to be signed on October 17, with those\r\ntransferring the pipe-line property. Never had there been an arrangement\r\nwhich gathered up so completely the oil outlets, for now the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio road came into a pool for the first time. Mr. Garrett had\r\nalways refused the advances of the other roads, but when he saw that the\r\nColumbia Conduit Line, his chief feeder, was sure to fall into Standard\r\nhands; when he began to suspect the Baltimore refiners were going into\r\nthe combination, he realised that if he expected to keep an oil traffic\r\nhe must join the other roads. The new pool, therefore, was between four\r\nroads. Sixty-three per cent. of the oil traffic was conceded to New\r\nYork, and of the sixty-three per cent. going there the Pennsylvania road\r\nwas to have twenty-one per cent. Thirty-seven per cent. of the traffic\r\nwas to go to Philadelphia and Baltimore, and of this thirty-seven per\r\ncent. the Pennsylvania had twenty-six per cent. The Standard guaranteed\r\nthe road not less than 2,000,000 barrels a year, and if it failed to\r\nsend that much over the road it was to pay it a sum equal to the profits\r\nit would have realised upon the quantity in deficit. In return for this\r\nguarantee of quantity the Standard was to pay such rates as might be\r\nfixed from time to time by the four trunk lines (which rates it was\r\nunderstood should be so fixed by the trunk lines as to place them on a\r\nparity as to cost of transportation by competing lines), and it was to\r\nreceive weekly a commission of ten per cent. on its shipments it\r\ncontrolled.[56] No commission was to be allowed any other shipper unless\r\nhe should guarantee and furnish such a quantity of oil that after\r\ndeducting any commission allowed, the road realised from it the same\r\namount of profits as it did from the Standard trade. The points in the\r\nagreement were embodied in a letter from William Rockefeller to Mr.\r\nScott. This letter and the answer declaring the arrangement to be\r\nsatisfactory to the company are both dated October 17.[57]\r\n\r\nFour months later Mr. Rockefeller was able to take another step of great\r\nadvantage. He was able to put into operation the system of drawbacks on\r\nother people’s shipments which the South Improvement Company contracts\r\nhad provided for, and which up to this point he seems not to have been\r\nsecurely enough placed to demand. There were no bones about the request\r\nnow. Mr. O’Day, the general manager of the American Transfer Company, a\r\npipe-line principally in Clarion County, Pennsylvania, which, including\r\nits branches, was from eighty to 100 miles in length, a company now one\r\nof the constituents of the United Pipe Line, wrote to Mr. Cassatt:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I here repeat what I once stated to you, and which I wish you to\r\n  receive and treat as strictly confidential, that we have been for\r\n  many months receiving from the New York Central and Erie Railroads\r\n  certain sums of money, in no instance less than twenty cents per\r\n  barrel on _every barrel of crude oil carried by each of these\r\n  roads_.” Continuing, Mr. O’Day says: “Co-operating as we are doing\r\n  with the Standard Oil Company and the trunk lines in every effort to\r\n  secure for the railroads paying rates of freight on the oil they\r\n  carry, I am constrained to say to you that in justice to the\r\n  interests I represent we should receive from your company at least\r\n  twenty cents on each barrel of crude oil you transport.... In\r\n  submitting this proposition I find that I should ask you to let this\r\n  date from November 1, 1877, but I am willing to accept as a\r\n  compromise (which is to be regarded as strictly a private one\r\n  between your company and ours) the payment by you of twenty cents\r\n  per barrel on all crude oil shipments commencing with February 1,\r\n  1878.”[58]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Cassatt complied with Mr. O’Day’s request. In a letter to the\r\ncomptroller of the road he said that he had agreed to allow this\r\ncommission after having seen the receipted bills, showing that the New\r\nYork Central allowed them a commission of thirty-five cents a barrel,\r\nand the Erie Railroad a commission of twenty cents a barrel on Bradford\r\noil and thirty cents on all other oils. Thus the Standard Oil Company,\r\nthrough the American Transfer Company, received, in addition to rebates\r\non its own shipments, from twenty to thirty-five cents drawback a barrel\r\non all crude oil which was sent over the trunk lines by other people as\r\nwell as by itself.[59]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this new concentration of power was immediate in all the\r\nrefining centres of the country. Most of the Baltimore refiners, some\r\neight in number, which up to this time had remained independent, seeing\r\nthemselves in danger of losing their oil supply, were united at the end\r\nof 1877 into the Baltimore United Oil Company, with J. N. Camden at\r\ntheir head. Mr. Camden was president of the Camden Consolidated Company\r\nof Parkersburg, West Virginia, a concern already in the Standard\r\nalliance, and he and his partners held the majority stock in the\r\nBaltimore concern. The method of reaching the Baltimore independents who\r\nlooked with dislike or fear on the Standard was a familiar one: An\r\nofficer of one of the concerns owned by the Standard Oil Company would\r\napproach the outsider who was feeling the pressure and propose a sale or\r\na lease to himself personally. It was an escape, and it usually ended in\r\nthe complete absorption of the plant by the Standard. A few of the\r\nBaltimore interests refused to go into the Baltimore United Oil Company.\r\nAmong them was a woman, a widow, Mrs. Sylvia C. Hunt, who had conducted\r\na successful refinery there for several years, and whose business\r\nability and energy had been the admiration of all those with whom she\r\nhad come in contact. Her interests had been particularly cherished by\r\nthe Empire Line, “Mrs. Hunt’s cars” being given precedence many a time\r\nby agents at Titusville or other shipping points who knew her story. In\r\nthe summer of 1877 her works burned out. With a courage which was\r\ngenerally commented on at the time Mrs. Hunt at once rebuilt and in less\r\nthan six months had her plant in running order. Then came the fall of\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company, the sale of the Columbia Conduit\r\nCompany, and the entrance of the Baltimore and Ohio into the Oil Pool.\r\nEvery refiner in Baltimore knew what that meant, and the wise sold when\r\nMr. Camden proposed it. Mrs. Hunt, however, did not want to sell. She\r\ndistrusted the new company. Finally with many misgivings she leased for\r\nfive years at $5,000 a year. It was less than half she had been making,\r\nso she claimed, and among her old friends there was much indignation.\r\nColonel Potts, indeed, in telling her story in his “Brief History of the\r\nStandard Oil Company,” said: “It could fairly have been expected that\r\nsomething of chivalrous feeling would be inspired by the sight of this\r\nindomitable spirit who had wrought so noble a work against such great\r\nodds. But though fine sentiments and generous words find frequent exodus\r\nfrom the lips of the Standard managers, they are never seconded by\r\ngenerous deeds. They crushed her business and her spirit as\r\nremorselessly as they would have killed a dog.” These are bitter words\r\nwritten when Colonel Potts was still smarting from his defeat. They were\r\nwritten, too, without reflection that Mrs. Hunt, if allowed to have all\r\nthe oil she wanted, allowed equal rates, allowed to use her ability and\r\nexperience, allowed freedom to sell in the markets she had built up,\r\nwould undoubtedly have increased her business. She would have profited\r\nby the high prices of refined oil which Mr. Rockefeller was taking all\r\nthis trouble to secure. She might have grown a formidable competitor\r\neven, and disturbed the steadiness of the working of the great machine.\r\nColonel Potts forgot that if the Great Purpose was realised nobody must\r\ndo business except under Mr. Rockefeller’s control.\r\n\r\nIn New York City the new tariff and pooling arrangements caused the\r\ngreatest uneasiness, for here was the largest group of prosperous\r\nindependent refiners. They had all allied themselves with the Empire\r\nTransportation Company in the spring of 1877 when its fight with the\r\nStandard had begun, but they had been dropped immediately when peace\r\nnegotiations were begun, and a letter of remonstrance they sent Mr.\r\nScott at the time was never answered.[60] The experiences of several of\r\nthese independents have been recorded in court testimony. One or two\r\nwill suffice here. For instance, among the Eastern refiners was the firm\r\nof Denslow and Bush; their works were located in South Brooklyn. They\r\nhad begun in a very small way in 1870, and by 1879 were doing a business\r\nof nearly 1,000 barrels of crude a day. They had transported nearly all\r\ntheir oil by the Empire Line. After that line went out of business in\r\nOctober, 1877, the contract with Denslow and Bush was transferred to the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company. This contract terminated on the first day\r\nof May, 1878. Some time in March they received formal notice of its\r\nexpiration, and solicited an interview with the officers of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad in order to make some arrangements for the further\r\ntransportation of their oil. Mr. Cassatt named New York. The meeting was\r\nheld at Mr. Denslow’s office, 123 Pearl Street. Besides Mr. Bush, there\r\nwere present to meet Mr. Cassatt, Messrs. Lombard, Gregory, King, H. C.\r\nOhlen, and C. C. Burke, all independents. When Mr. Bush was under\r\nexamination in the suit against the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1879 he\r\ngave an account of what happened at this interview:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We asked Mr. Cassatt what rate of freight we should have after the\r\n  expiration of these contracts, whether we should have as low a rate\r\n  of freight as the Standard Oil Company or any other shipper? He\r\n  said, ‘No,’ We asked why. ‘Well, in the first place, you can’t ship\r\n  as much oil as the Standard Oil Company,’ ‘Well, if we could ship as\r\n  much oil’—I think Mr. Lombard put this question—‘would we then have\r\n  the same rate?’ He said, ‘No,’ ‘Why?’ ‘Why, you could not keep the\r\n  road satisfied; it would make trouble.’ And he remarked in\r\n  connection with that, that the Standard Oil Company was the only\r\n  party that could keep the roads harmonised or satisfied. He\r\n  intimated, I believe, that each road had a certain percentage of the\r\n  oil business, and they could divide that up and give each road its\r\n  proportion, and in that way keep harmony, which we could not do.\r\n  Right after that he made the remark that he thought that we ought to\r\n  fix it up with the Standard; we ought to do something so as to all\r\n  go on and make some money, and I think we gave him very distinctly\r\n  to understand that we didn’t propose to enter into any ‘fix up’\r\n  where we would lose our identity, or sell out, or be under anybody\r\n  else’s thumb. I believe that he went so far as to say that he would\r\n  see the Standard, and do everything he could to bring that thing\r\n  about. We told him very clearly that we didn’t want any interference\r\n  in that direction, and if there was anything to be done, we thought\r\n  we were quite capable of doing it. The interview perhaps lasted an\r\n  hour. There was a great deal of talk of one kind and another, but\r\n  this is, I think, the substance. This interview was in March, 1878,\r\n  I think.\r\n\r\n  “Another interview at which I was present was either in June or\r\n  July. Mr. Scott was present. This interview was brought about\r\n  because we had been deprived, as we believed, of getting a\r\n  sufficient number of cars we were entitled to. We had telegraphed or\r\n  written to Mr. Cassatt—at least, Mr. Ohlen, our agent, had, on\r\n  several occasions, and tried to get an interview, and finally this\r\n  one was appointed, at which Mr. Scott would be present. When we\r\n  arrived there we found Mr. Brundred, from Oil City; and Mr. Scott\r\n  went on to state that he thought that we were receiving our fair\r\n  proportion of cars. They tried to make us believe and feel, I\r\n  suppose, that we were getting our due proportion, when for some\r\n  considerable time previous to this we had not been able to do any\r\n  business in advance; we could only do business from hand to mouth.\r\n  We could not sell any refined oil unless we absolutely had the crude\r\n  oil in our possession in New York, and Mr. Lombard, one of our\r\n  number, had sold a cargo of crude oil, I think, of 9,000 barrels,\r\n  and Denslow and Bush absolutely stopped their refinery for three\r\n  weeks consequently, in order to let their oil go to Ayres and\r\n  Lombard to finish their vessel, because they would only get three or\r\n  four cars a day; and we stopped our place for three weeks to give\r\n  them our crude oil, all we could give—our proportion—in order to\r\n  lift them out and get their vessel cleared. After trying to impress\r\n  upon us that we were getting our proportion of cars, we asked Mr.\r\n  Scott substantially the same question we asked Mr. Cassatt in New\r\n  York, whether we could have, if there was any means by which we\r\n  could have, the same rate of freight as other shippers got, and he\r\n  said flatly, ‘No’; and we asked him then if we shipped the same\r\n  amount of oil as the Standard, and he said, ‘No,’ and gave the same\r\n  reasons Mr. Cassatt had in New York, that the Standard Oil Company\r\n  were the only parties that could keep peace among the roads. We\r\n  stated to Mr. Scott that we would like to know to what extent we\r\n  would be discriminated against, because we wanted to know what\r\n  disadvantage we would have to work under. And we went away very much\r\n  dissatisfied. All the information we got on that point was from Mr.\r\n  Cassatt in New York, when he stated that the discrimination would be\r\n  larger on a high rate of freight than on a low rate of freight,\r\n  which led us to infer that it was a percentage discrimination. That\r\n  is all the point that I recollect we ever got as to the amount of\r\n  the commission. We told Mr. Scott that if they hadn’t sufficient\r\n  cars on their road we would like to put some on, and he told us\r\n  flatly that they had just bought out one line and they would not\r\n  allow another one to be put on; that if they hadn’t cars enough they\r\n  would build them. He seemed to show considerable feeling that\r\n  afternoon, and he said: ‘Well, you have cost us in fighting for you\r\n  now a million dollars’ (or a million and a half, something like\r\n  that—a very large sum), ‘and we don’t propose to go into another\r\n  fight.’”[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem there were not only men in the refining business\r\nwho were willing to fight under these conditions, there were men among\r\nthe very ones who had succumbed at the opening of the Standard’s\r\nonslaught who were ready to try the business again. Among these was\r\nWilliam Harkness, whose experience up to 1876 was related in the\r\npreceding chapter. Mr. Harkness’s next experience in the oil business\r\nwas related to the same committee as that already mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “When I was compelled to succumb,” he said, “I thought it was only\r\n  temporarily; that the time would come when I could go into the\r\n  business I was devoted to. We systematised all our accounts and knew\r\n  where the weak points were. I was in love with the business. I\r\n  selected a site near three railroads and the river. I took a run\r\n  across the water—I was tired and discouraged and used up in 1876,\r\n  and was gone three or four months. I came back refreshed and ready\r\n  for work, and had the plans and specifications and estimates made\r\n  for a refinery that would handle 10,000 barrels of oil a day, right\r\n  on this hundred acres of land. I believed the time had arrived when\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad would see their true interest as common\r\n  carriers, and the interest of their stockholders and the business\r\n  interest of the city of Philadelphia, and I took those plans,\r\n  specifications, and estimates, and I called on Mr. Roberts,\r\n  president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. I had consulted one\r\n  or two other gentlemen, whose advice was worth having, whether it\r\n  would be worth my while to go to see President Roberts. I went there\r\n  and laid the plans before him, and told him I wanted to build a\r\n  refinery of 10,000 barrels capacity a day. I was almost on my knees\r\n  begging him to allow me to do that. He said; ‘What is it you want?’\r\n  I said; ‘I simply ask to be put upon an equality with everybody\r\n  else, and especially the Standard Oil Company.’ I said; ‘I want you\r\n  to agree with me that you will give me transportation of crude oil\r\n  as low as you give it to the Standard Oil Company or anybody else\r\n  for ten years, and then I will give you a written assurance that I\r\n  will do this refining of 10,000 barrels of oil a day for ten years.’\r\n  I asked him if that was not an honest position for us to be in; I,\r\n  as a manufacturer, and he, the president of a railroad. Mr. Roberts\r\n  said there was a great deal of force in what I said, but he could\r\n  not go into any written assurance. He said he would not go into any\r\n  such agreement, and I saw Mr. Cassatt. He said in his frank way;\r\n  ‘That is not practicable, and you know the reason why.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this work of absorption went on steadily, persistently, the\r\nsuperstitious fear of resistance to proposals to lease or sell which\r\ncame from parties known or suspected to be working in harmony with the\r\nStandard Oil Company, which had been strong in 1875, grew almost\r\ninsuperable. In Cleveland this was particularly true. A proposal from\r\nMr. Rockefeller was certainly regarded popularly as little better than a\r\ncommand to “stand and deliver.” “The coal-oil business belongs to us,”\r\nMr. Rockefeller had told Mr. Morehouse. “We have facilities; we must\r\nhave it. Any concern that starts in business we have sufficient money\r\nlaid aside to wipe out”[62]—and people believed him! The feeling is\r\nadmirably shown in a remarkable case still quoted in Cleveland—and which\r\nbelongs to the same period as the foregoing cases, 1878—a case which\r\ntook the deeper hold on the public sympathy because the contestant was a\r\nwoman, the widow of one of the first refiners of the town, a Mr. B——,\r\nwho had begun refining in Cleveland in 1860. Mr. B——’s principal\r\nbusiness was the manufacture of lubricating oil. Now at the start the\r\nStandard Oil Company handled only illuminating oil, and accordingly a\r\ncontract was made between the two parties that Mr. B—— should sell to\r\nMr. Rockefeller his refined oil, and that the Standard Oil Company\r\nshould let the lubricating business in Cleveland alone. This was the\r\nstatus when in 1874 Mr. B—— died. What happened afterwards has been told\r\nin full in affidavits made in 1880,[63] and they shall tell the story;\r\nthe only change made in the documents being to transfer them for the\r\nsake of clarity from the legal third person to the first, and to\r\ncondense them on account of space.\r\n\r\nMrs. B——’s story as told in her affidavit is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “My husband having contracted a debt not long prior to his death for\r\n  the first time in his life, I, for the interest of my fatherless\r\n  children, as well as myself, thought it my duty to endeavour to\r\n  continue the business, and accordingly took $92,000 of the stock of\r\n  the B—— Oil Company and afterwards reduced it to $72,000 or $75,000,\r\n  the whole stock of the company being $100,000, and continued\r\n  business from that time until November, 1878, making handsome\r\n  profits out of the business during perhaps the hardest years of the\r\n  time since Mr. B—— had commenced. Some time in November, 1878, the\r\n  Standard Oil Company sent a man to me by the name of Peter S.\r\n  Jennings, who had been engaged in the refining business and had sold\r\n  out to the Standard Oil Company. I told Mr. Jennings that I would\r\n  carry on no negotiations with him whatever, but that if the Standard\r\n  Oil Company desired to buy my stock I must transact the business\r\n  with its principal officer, Mr. Rockefeller. Mr. Jennings, as\r\n  representing the Standard Oil Company, told me that the president of\r\n  the company, Mr. Rockefeller, said that said company would control\r\n  the refining business, and that he hoped it could be done in one or\r\n  two years; but if not, it would be done, anyway, if it took ten\r\n  years to do it.\r\n\r\n  “After two or three days’ delay Mr. Rockefeller called upon me at my\r\n  residence to talk over the negotiation with regard to the purchase\r\n  of my stock. I told Mr. Rockefeller that I realised the fact that\r\n  the B—— Oil Company was entirely in the power of the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, and that all I could do would be to appeal to his honour as\r\n  a gentleman and to his sympathy to do with me the best that he\r\n  could; and I begged of him to consider his wife in my position—that\r\n  I had been left with this business and with my fatherless children,\r\n  and with a large indebtedness that Mr. B—— had just contracted for\r\n  the first time in his life; that I felt that I could not do without\r\n  the income arising from this business, and that I had taken it up\r\n  and gone on and been successful, and I was left with it in the\r\n  hardest years since my husband commenced the business. He said he\r\n  was aware of what I had done, and that his wife could never have\r\n  accomplished so much. I called his attention to the contract that my\r\n  husband had made with him in relation to carbon oil, whereby the\r\n  Standard Oil Company agreed not to touch the lubricating branch of\r\n  the trade carried on by my husband, and reminded him that I had held\r\n  to that contract rigidly, at a great loss to the B—— Oil Company,\r\n  but did so because I regarded it a matter of honour to live up to\r\n  it. I told him that I had become alarmed because the Standard Oil\r\n  Company was getting control of all the refineries in the country,\r\n  and that I feared that the said Standard Oil Company would go into\r\n  the lubricating trade, and reminded him that he had sent me word\r\n  that the Standard Oil Company would not interfere with that branch\r\n  of the trade. He promised, with tears in his eyes, that he would\r\n  stand by me in this transaction, and that I should not be wronged;\r\n  and he told me that, in case the sale was made, I might retain\r\n  whatever amount of the stock of the B—— Oil Company I desired, his\r\n  object appearing to be only to get the controlling stock of the\r\n  company. He said that while the negotiations were pending he would\r\n  come and see me, and I thought that his feelings were such on the\r\n  subject that I could trust him and that he would deal honourably by\r\n  me.\r\n\r\n  “Seeing that I was compelled to sell out, I wanted the Standard Oil\r\n  Company to make me a proposition, and endeavoured to get them to do\r\n  so, but they would not make a proposition. I then made a proposition\r\n  that the whole stock of the B—— Oil Company with accrued dividends\r\n  should be sold to said Standard Oil Company for $200,000, which was,\r\n  in fact, much below what the stock ought to have been sold for; but\r\n  they ridiculed the amount, and at last offered me only $79,000, not\r\n  including accounts, and required that each stockholder in the B——\r\n  Oil Company should enter into a bond that within the period of ten\r\n  years he or she would not directly or indirectly engage in or in any\r\n  way be concerned in the refining, manufacturing, producing, piping,\r\n  or dealing in petroleum or in any of its products within the county\r\n  of Cuyahoga and state of Ohio, nor at any other place whatever.\r\n\r\n  “Seeing that the property had to go, I asked that I might, according\r\n  to the understanding with the president of the company, retain\r\n  $15,000 of my stock, but the reply to this request was; ‘No\r\n  outsiders can have any interest in this concern; the Standard Oil\r\n  Company has “dallied” as long as it will over this matter; it must\r\n  be settled up to-day or go,’ and they insisted upon my signing the\r\n  bond above referred to.\r\n\r\n  “The promises made by Mr. Rockefeller, president of the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, were none of them fulfilled; he neither allowed me to\r\n  retain any portion of my stock, nor did he in any way assist me in\r\n  my negotiations for the sale of my stock; but, on the contrary, was\r\n  largely instrumental in my being obliged to sell the property much\r\n  below its true value, and requiring me to enter into the oppressive\r\n  bond above referred to.\r\n\r\n  “After the arrangements for the sale of the refinery and of my stock\r\n  were fully completed and the property had been sold by myself and\r\n  the other stockholders, and after I had made arrangements for the\r\n  disposition of my money, I received a note from Mr. Rockefeller, in\r\n  reply to one that I had written to him threatening to make the\r\n  transaction public, saying that he would give me back the business\r\n  as it stood, or that I might retain stock if I wished to, but this\r\n  was after the entire transaction was closed, and such arrangements\r\n  had been made for my money that I could not then conveniently enter\r\n  into it; and I was so indignant over the offer being made at that\r\n  late day, after my request for the stock having been made at the\r\n  proper time, that I threw the letter into the fire and paid no\r\n  further attention to it.”[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter which Mrs. B—— destroyed was included in the affidavit in\r\nwhich Mr. Rockefeller answered Mrs. B——’s statement. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “November 13, 1878. DEAR MADAM: I have held your note of 11th inst.,\r\n  received yesterday, until to-day, as I wished to thoroughly review\r\n  every point connected with the negotiations for the purchase of the\r\n  stock of the B—— Oil Company, to satisfy myself as to whether I had\r\n  unwittingly done anything whereby you could have any right to feel\r\n  injured. It is true that in the interview I had with you I suggested\r\n  that if you desired to do so, you could retain an interest in the\r\n  business of the B—— Oil Company, by keeping some number of its\r\n  shares, and then I understood you to say that if you sold out you\r\n  wished to go entirely out of the business. That being my\r\n  understanding, our arrangements were made in case you concluded to\r\n  make the sale that precluded any other interests being represented,\r\n  and therefore, when you did make the inquiry as to your taking some\r\n  of the stock, our answer was given in accordance with the facts\r\n  noted above, but not at all in the spirit in which you refer to the\r\n  refusal in your note. In regard to the reference that you make as to\r\n  my permitting the business of the B—— Oil Company to _be taken_ from\r\n  you, I say that in this, as all else that you have written in your\r\n  letter of 11th inst., you do me most grievous wrong. It was of but\r\n  little moment to the interests represented by me whether the\r\n  business of the B—— Oil Company was purchased or not. I believe that\r\n  it was for your interest to make the sale, and am entirely candid in\r\n  this statement, and beg to call your attention to the time, some two\r\n  years ago, when you consulted Mr. Flagler and myself as to selling\r\n  out your interests to Mr. Rose, at which time you were desirous of\r\n  selling at _considerably less price_, and upon time, than you have\r\n  now received in cash, and which sale you would have been glad to\r\n  have closed if you could have obtained satisfactory security for the\r\n  deferred payments. As to the price paid for the property, it is\r\n  certainly three times greater than the cost at which we could\r\n  construct equal or better facilities; but wishing to take a liberal\r\n  view of it, I urged the proposal of paying the $60,000, which was\r\n  thought much too high by some of our parties. I believe that if you\r\n  would reconsider what you have written in your letter, to which this\r\n  is a reply, you must admit having done me great injustice, and I am\r\n  satisfied to await upon innate sense of right for such admission.\r\n  However, in view of what seems your present feelings, I now offer to\r\n  restore to you the purchase made by us, you simply returning the\r\n  amount of money which we have invested and leaving us as though no\r\n  purchase had been made. Should you not desire to accept this\r\n  proposal, I offer to you one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred\r\n  shares of the stock at the same price that we paid for the same,\r\n  with this addition, that we keep the property we are under\r\n  engagement to pay into the treasury of the B—— Oil Company, an\r\n  amount which, added to the amount already paid, would make a total\r\n  of $100,000, and thereby make the shares $100 each.\r\n\r\n  “That you may not be compelled to hastily come to conclusion, I will\r\n  leave open for three days these propositions for your acceptance or\r\n  declination, and in the meantime believe me,\r\n\r\n                                                     Yours very truly,\r\n                                               “JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller says further in the affidavit from which this letter is\r\ndrawn: “It is not true that I made any promises that I did not keep in\r\nthe letter and spirit, and it is not true that I was instrumental to any\r\ndegree in her being obliged to sell the property much below its true\r\nvalue, and I aver that she was not obliged to sell out, and that such\r\nwas a voluntary one upon her part and for a sum far in excess of its\r\nvalue; and that the construction which was purchased of her could be\r\nreplaced for a sum not exceeding $20,000.”[65]\r\n\r\nIt is probably true, as Mr. Rockefeller states, that he could have\r\nreproduced Mrs. B——’s plant for $20,000; but the plant was but a small\r\npart of her assets. She owned one of the oldest lubricating oil\r\nrefineries in the country, one with an enviable reputation for good work\r\nand fair dealing, and with a trade that had been paying an annual net\r\nincome of from $30,000 to $40,000. It was this income for which Mr.\r\nRockefeller paid $79,000; this income with the old and honourable name\r\nof the B—— Oil Company, with not a few stills and tanks and agitators.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly true, as Mr. Rockefeller avers, that Mrs. B—— was not\r\nobliged to sell out, but the fate of those who in this period of\r\nabsorption refused to sell was before her eyes. She had seen the twenty\r\nCleveland refineries fall into Mr. Rockefeller’s hands in 1872. She had\r\nwatched the steady collapse of the independents in all the refining\r\ncentres. She had seen every effort to preserve an individual business\r\nthwarted. Rightly or wrongly she had come to believe that a refusal to\r\nsell meant a fight with Mr. Rockefeller, that a fight meant ultimately\r\ndefeat, and she gave up her business to avoid ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER SEVEN\r\n                           THE CRISIS OF 1878\r\n\r\n  A RISE IN OIL—A BLOCKADE IN EXPORTS—PRODUCERS DO NOT GET THEIR SHARE\r\n    OF THE PROFITS—THEY SECRETLY ORGANISE THE PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION\r\n    AND PROMISE TO SUPPORT PROPOSED INDEPENDENT PIPE-LINES—ANOTHER\r\n    INTERSTATE COMMERCE BILL DEFEATED AT WASHINGTON—“IMMEDIATE\r\n    SHIPMENT”—INDEPENDENTS HAVE TROUBLE GETTING CARS—RIOTS\r\n    THREATENED—APPEAL TO GOVERNOR HARTRANFT—SUITS BROUGHT AGAINST UNITED\r\n    PIPE-LINES, PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD AND OTHERS—INVESTIGATIONS\r\n    PRECIPITATED IN OTHER STATES—THE HEPBURN COMMISSION AND THE OHIO\r\n    INVESTIGATION—EVIDENCE THAT THE STANDARD IS A CONTINUATION OF THE\r\n    SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY—PRODUCERS FINALLY DECIDE TO PROCEED\r\n    AGAINST STANDARD OFFICIALS—ROCKEFELLER AND EIGHT OF HIS ASSOCIATES\r\n    INDICTED FOR CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough by the opening of 1878 that Mr. Rockefeller need no\r\nlonger fear any serious trouble from the refining element. To be sure\r\nthere were scattered concerns still holding out and some of them doing\r\nvery well; but his latest move had put him in a position to cut off or\r\nat least seriously to interfere with the very raw material in which they\r\nworked. It was hardly to be expected after the defeat of the\r\nPennsylvania that any railroad would be rash enough to combine with even\r\na strong group of refiners. As for independent pipe-lines, there were so\r\nmany ways of “discouraging” their building that it did not seem probable\r\nthat any one would ever go far. It was only a matter of time, then, when\r\nall remaining outside refiners must come into his fold or die. Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s path would now have been smooth had it not been for the\r\noil producers. But the oil producers, naturally his enemy, he being the\r\nbuyer and they the seller, had become in the six years before Mr.\r\nRockefeller had made himself the only gatherer of their oil,\r\nirreconcilable opponents of whatever he might do. The South Improvement\r\nCompany they regarded rightly enough as devised to control the price of\r\ntheir product, and that scheme they wrongfully laid entirely at Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s door. Mr. Rockefeller had been only one of the originators\r\nof the South Improvement Company, but the fact that he had become later\r\npractically its only supporter, that he was the only one who had\r\nprofited by it, and that he had turned his Cleveland plant into a\r\nmachine for carrying out its provisions, had caused the oil country to\r\nfix on him the entire responsibility. Then the oil men’s experience with\r\nMr. Rockefeller in 1873 had been unfortunate. They charged the failure\r\nof their alliance to his duplicity. There is no doubt that Mr.\r\nRockefeller played a shrewd and false game with the oil men in 1873, but\r\nthe failure of their alliance was their own fault. They did not hold\r\ntogether—they failed to limit their production as they agreed, they\r\nsuspected one another, and at a moment, when, if they had been as\r\npatient and wise as their great opponent they would have had the game in\r\ntheir own hands, and him at their feet, as he had been in 1872, for the\r\nsake of immediate returns, they abandoned some of the best features of\r\ntheir organisation, and allied themselves with a man they distrusted.\r\nWhen that alliance failed they threw on Mr. Rockefeller’s shoulders a\r\nblame which they should have taken on their own.\r\n\r\nAnother very real cause for their anxiety and dislike was that as the\r\nrefiners’ alliance progressed the refiners made a much larger share of\r\nthe profits than the producers thought fair. The abandoning of their\r\nalliance in 1873 had of course put an end to their measures for limiting\r\nproduction and for holding over-production until it could be sold at the\r\nprices they thought profitable. The drill had gone on merrily through\r\n1873, 1874, and 1875, regardless of consumption or prices. By the end of\r\n1874 there were over three and a half million barrels of oil in stock,\r\nmore than twice what there had ever been before. Production was well to\r\na million barrels a month and prices that year averaged but $1.15 a\r\nbarrel. For men who considered three dollars a starvation price this was\r\nindeed hard luck. Things looked better by the end of 1875, for\r\nproduction was falling off. By March, 1876, stocks had been so reduced\r\nthat there was strong confidence that the price of crude oil must\r\nadvance. By June the Oil City Derrick began to prophesy “three-dollar\r\noil” and to advise oil men to hold crude for that price. In August three\r\ndollars was reached in the Oil City exchange. It had been nearly four\r\nyears since that price had been paid for oil, and the day the point was\r\nreached (August 25) the brokers fairly went mad. They jumped on their\r\nchairs, threw up their hats, beat one another on the back, while the\r\nspectators in the crowded galleries, most of them speculators, yelled in\r\nsympathy. Before six o’clock that day oil reached $3.11¼. Nobody thought\r\nof stopping because it was supper time. The exchange was open until\r\nnearly midnight, prices booming on to $3.17½. It seemed like old times\r\nin the Oil Region—the good old flush times when people made a fortune\r\none day and threw it away the next!\r\n\r\nOf course refined oil went up steadily with crude. Refined reached 21⅜\r\ncents in New York the day of this boom at Oil City. The day following\r\nthe rise was one of the most exciting the oil exchange had ever seen.\r\n“Never before,” declared the Derrick in its report, “was so much\r\nbusiness done.” From early in the morning until ten o’clock at night the\r\nexchange was crowded by frantic speculators. Their awful excitement was\r\nclear from their blanched faces and wild voices. Fully 800,000 barrels\r\nof oil exchanged hands that day, the advance between the time the\r\nexchange opened and its close was over fifty-five cents. Refined in New\r\nYork advanced in accordance with the market on the creek, closing at\r\ntwenty-four cents. This went on for several days, when a new element in\r\nthe situation began to force itself on the oil men’s attention. One of\r\nthe chief reasons on which they based their confidence in high prices\r\nfor crude oil was the fact that the foreigners were short of refined\r\noil. It was the custom then, as now, for exporters to buy their oil for\r\nthe winter European trade in the late summer and early fall. When the\r\nboom began the harbour at New York was beginning to fill up with ships\r\nfor cargoes. But to the consternation of the oil men intent on keeping\r\nup the boom, the exporters were refusing to buy. They were declaring the\r\nprice to which refined had risen to be out of proportion to the price of\r\ncrude. More, they declared the latter a speculative price—only once,\r\nthey argued, had it touched four dollars, and the refiners were not\r\nbuying at that price for manufacture. They were holding refined too\r\nhigh. It was early in September when the realisation came upon the Oil\r\nRegions that a new element was in the problem—a veritable blockade in\r\nexports. As the days went on they saw that this was no temporary affair.\r\nThey saw that Mr. Rockefeller’s combination was at last carrying out\r\njust what it had been organised to do—forcing the price it wanted for\r\nrefined. Day after day refined was held at twenty-six cents. Day after\r\nday the exporters refused to buy. It was not until the end of September,\r\nin fact, that they began to yield—as it was inevitable they should do,\r\nfor the game was certainly in the hands of the refiners, and Europe had\r\nto have its light. The exporters began to see too that if they held off\r\nlonger they might have to pay higher prices, for it was rumoured that\r\nthe Standard Combination was shutting down its factories, literally\r\nmaking refined scarce, while crude oil was piling up in Pennsylvania!\r\n\r\nWith the yielding of the exporter exactly what they feared occurred, the\r\nprice was raised! The exporters balked again. The matter began to\r\nattract public attention. The New York Herald was particularly active in\r\nairing the situation and did not hesitate to denounce it as a “Petroleum\r\nPlot.” The leaders were interviewed, among them Mr. Rockefeller. Mr.\r\nRockefeller still held to his theory that to make oil dear was worthy of\r\npublic approval. They had aimed to control the price of oil in a\r\nperfectly legitimate way, he told the Herald reporter, and the exporters\r\nwould have to yield to their prices. By the end of October New York\r\nharbour was full of vessels—a mute protest against the corner—and it was\r\nnot until November that the exporters fully gave in and began to take\r\nall the oil they could get at prices asked, which ranged from twenty-six\r\nto thirty-five cents. And these prices were held all through the winter\r\nof 1876–77, up to February 22. They were held regardless of the price of\r\ncrude, for, do their utmost, the producers could not keep their oil up\r\nto the corresponding price of refined. According to the scale of\r\nrelative prices then accepted, twenty-six cents a gallon for refined\r\nmeant five dollars a barrel for crude, yet there was not a month in the\r\nentire period of this hold-up that crude averaged that price. In\r\nDecember, when the average price of refined was 29⅜ cents, crude was but\r\n$3.78⅛ a barrel. The producers held meetings and passed resolutions,\r\ncursed the refiners and talked of building independent refineries,\r\nfilled the columns of the Derrick with open letters advocating a\r\nshut-down, an alliance of their own, restrictive legislation, an oil\r\nmen’s railway, and what was more to the point some of them supported,\r\nwith more or less fidelity, the efforts to build up counter movements\r\nnoted in the last chapter: the Columbia Conduit Line, the seaboard\r\npipe-line, and especially the alliance with the Empire Transportation\r\nCompany, attempted in the spring of 1877. There seemed more hope in this\r\nlast combination than in any other movement, for they had faith in\r\nColonel Potts, and besides they were accustomed to seeing the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad get what it wanted. The defeat of the Pennsylvania\r\nwas therefore the heavier blow. Indeed, the news of the sale of the\r\nEmpire pipe-lines to the Standard was like the sounding of the tocsin in\r\nthe angry and baffled Oil Regions. It revived the spirit of 1872. But it\r\nwas the spirit of 1872 with new dignity and a discretion such as had\r\nnever been before seen in the blatant region. In every town from McKean\r\nCounty southwest to Butler the oil towns hastened to organise themselves\r\ninto a secret society. Little by little it came out that a Producers’\r\nUnion had been organised. From all that could be learned it looked very\r\nmuch as if the Petroleum Producers’ Union had come into existence to do\r\nbusiness. On November 21, 1877, the first meeting of the new\r\norganisation was held, “the Petroleum Parliament” or “Congress” it was\r\ncalled. This Congress, which met in Titusville, was composed of 172\r\ndelegates. It was claimed that it represented at least 2,000 oil\r\nproducers, and not less than seventy-five millions in money. It is\r\ncertain it included the representative men of the Oil Regions, those to\r\nwhose daring, hard work, and energy the discovery and development of the\r\noil fields, as they were known at that time, were entirely due.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WOODEN CAR TANKS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BOILER TANK CARS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WOODEN TANKS FOR STORING OIL\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAILROAD TERMINAL OF AN EARLY PIPE LINE\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor four days the Congress was in session, and it is a remarkable\r\ncomment on the seriousness with which it had undertaken its work that,\r\nalthough reporters from all parts of the country interested in oil were\r\npresent, nothing leaked out. In December a second session of four days\r\nwas held in Titusville, but no announcement of what was doing was made\r\nto the press. Indeed, it was only as lines of action developed that the\r\npublic became familiar with what the producers had resolved on in the\r\ndays of secret session which they had held.\r\n\r\nTheir resolutions had been eminently wise and they undertook their\r\nsupport vigorously and intelligently. First and foremost they resolved\r\nto stand by all efforts to secure an outlet to the seaboard independent\r\nof the Standard and the allied railroads. Two enterprises were put\r\nbefore them at once. The first was what was known as the Equitable\r\nPetroleum Company, an organisation started by one of the most\r\nresourceful and active independent men in the oil country, one of whom\r\nwe are to hear more, Lewis Emery, Jr. This company, in which some 200\r\noil producers in the Bradford field had taken stock, proposed to lay a\r\npipe-line to Buffalo and to ship their oil thence by the Erie Canal.\r\nThey had acquired a right of way to Buffalo and had capital pledged to\r\ncarry out the project. The second enterprise to come before the newly\r\nformed union was much more ambitious. It was nothing less than a revival\r\nof Mr. Harley’s enterprise which had attracted so much attention in\r\n1876. It was revived now by the three men who had been operating the\r\nColumbia Conduit Line under a lease—Messrs. Benson, McKelvy and Hopkins,\r\nwho had been set free by the sale of that property to the Standard.\r\nTheir experience with the pipe-line business had convinced them it was\r\none of the most lucrative departments of the oil industry. They believed\r\ntoo that oil could be pumped over the mountains, and no sooner were they\r\nfree than they took up Mr. Harley’s old idea and engaged the same\r\nengineer he had brought into the enterprise, General Herman Haupt, to\r\nsurvey a route from Brady’s Bend on the Allegheny River to Baltimore,\r\nMaryland—a distance of 235 miles. To both of these projects the General\r\nCouncil of the Union gave promise of support.\r\n\r\nThe demand for interstate commerce legislation was renewed at once by\r\nthe Union, and in December E. G. Patterson, the head of the committee\r\nhaving the matter in hand, prepared the first draft of an act which was\r\nput in formal shape by George B. Hibbard, of Buffalo, counsel employed\r\nby the Union for this purpose. Mr. Hibbard also prepared a memorandum of\r\nthe law on the subject. The bill prepared by Mr. Patterson and Mr.\r\nHibbard was introduced into the House of Representatives in May, 1878,\r\nby Lewis F. Watson, whose home was in Warren County, Pennsylvania. It\r\nwas called into committee and came out as the Regan bill and as such was\r\npassed at the end of the year by the House, but only to be smothered\r\nlater in the Senate. At the same time that the effort was going in\r\nWashington for relief the Legislature of Pennsylvania was being besieged\r\nagain for a free pipe-line bill and an anti-discrimination bill. Both of\r\nthese projects failed, and the committee having them in charge said\r\nbitterly in its report to the Union: “How well we have succeeded at\r\nHarrisburg you all know. It would be in vain for your committee to\r\ndescribe the efforts of the Council in this direction. It has been\r\nsimply a history of failure and disgrace. If it has taught us anything,\r\nit is that our present law-makers, as a body, are ignorant, corrupt and\r\nunprincipled; that the majority of them are, directly or indirectly,\r\nunder the control of the very monopolies against whose acts we have been\r\nseeking relief.... There has been invented by the Standard Oil Company\r\nno argument or assertion, however false or ridiculous, which has not\r\nfound a man in the Pennsylvania Legislature mean enough to become its\r\nchampion.”\r\n\r\nOn every side indeed the producers hastened to protect themselves\r\nagainst the Lord of the Oil Regions, as Mr. Rockefeller, not inaptly,\r\nwas called, on the completion of his pipe-line monopoly. That they were\r\nnot merely alarmists in thinking that they must do something to protect\r\ntheir interests was demonstrated sooner than was anticipated. The\r\ndemonstration was hurried by an unforeseen and difficult situation—a\r\ngreat outpouring of oil in a new field—the Bradford or Northern Field in\r\nMcKean County, Pennsylvania. About the time that Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\nlordship was realised it became certain that a deposit of oil had been\r\ndiscovered which was going to lead soon to a production vastly in excess\r\nof the consumption, as well as in excess of the then existing facilities\r\nfor gathering and storing oil. If Mr. Rockefeller wished to keep his\r\nmonopoly he must, it was evident, enter upon a campaign of expansion\r\ncalling for an immense expenditure of energy and money. He must lay\r\npipes in a hundred directions to get the output of new wells; he must\r\nbuild tanks holding thousands of barrels to receive the oil. And all of\r\nthis must be done quickly if rivals were to be kept out of the way.\r\nThere was no hesitation on the part of the United Pipe Lines. One of the\r\ngreatest construction feats the country has ever seen was put through in\r\nthe years 1878, 1879 and 1880 in the Bradford oil field by the Standard\r\ninterests. It was a wonderful illustration of the surpassing\r\nintelligence, energy and courage with which the Standard Oil Company\r\nattacks its problems. But while it was putting through this feat it\r\ninstituted a policy toward the producers which was regarded by them as\r\ntyrannical and unjustifiable. The first manœuvre in this new policy hit\r\nthe producer in a very tender spot, for it concerned the price he was to\r\nreceive for oil.\r\n\r\nThe method which prevailed at the time in handling and buying and\r\nselling oil was this: At the request of the well owner connected with a\r\npipe-line his oil was run and credited to him in the pipe-line office.\r\nHere he could hold it as long as he wished by paying a storage charge.\r\nIf he wished to sell his “credit balance,” as oil to his account was\r\ncalled, he simply gave the buyer an order on the line for the oil, and\r\nit was transferred to the account of the new buyer. The pipe-lines\r\nfrequently had hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil in hand, and they\r\ntraded with this oil as banks do with their deposits—that is, they\r\nissued certificates for each 1,000 barrels of oil on hand, and these\r\ncertificates were negotiable like any other paper. Now the United Pipe\r\nLines acknowledged itself a common carrier, and so was obliged to\r\ndischarge the duty of collecting oil on demand, or at least within a\r\nreasonable time after the demand of its patrons.\r\n\r\nBut in December, 1877, after the monopoly was completed, they refused to\r\ndischarge their obligations in the customary way. On the plea that they\r\nhad not sufficient tankage to carry oil in the Bradford field, they\r\nissued an order that no oil would be run in that district for any one\r\nunless it was sold for “immediate shipment”—that is, no oil would be\r\ntaken to hold for storage; it would be taken for shipping only. At the\r\nsame time the Standard buyer, J. A. Bostwick, decreed that henceforth no\r\nBradford oil would be bought for immediate shipment unless it was\r\noffered at _less_ than the market price. No fixed discount was set. The\r\nseller was asked what he would take; his offer was, of course, according\r\nto his necessities. Even then an answer was not always immediately\r\ngiven. The seller was told to come back in five or ten days and he would\r\nbe told if his oil would be taken. A feature of the new order,\r\nparticularly galling to the oil men, was the manner in which it was\r\nenforced. Formerly the buyer and seller had met freely in the oil\r\nexchanges and their business offices, and transactions had been carried\r\non as among equals. Now the producers were obliged to form in line\r\nbefore the United Pipe Lines’ offices and to enter one at a time to\r\nconsult the buyer. A line of a hundred men or more often stood during\r\nthe hours set before the office, waiting their turn to dispose of their\r\noil. It should be said in justice to Mr. Bostwick that he was not the\r\nfirst buyer to take oil at a discount. The producers themselves\r\nfrequently offered oil at less than the market price when in need of\r\nmoney, but Mr. Bostwick was the first buyer in a situation to force them\r\nto make the discount regularly. When these orders came, few of the\r\nproducers had sufficient private tankage to take care of any amount of\r\noil. Here was the situation then: to keep oil from running on the ground\r\nthe producer must sell it; but if he sold it he must take a price from\r\ntwo to twenty-five cents or more below the market.\r\n\r\nThe immediate shipment order was not an invention of the United Pipe\r\nLines. It had been enforced more than once for brief periods by various\r\nlines when they found their capacity overcrowded by some unexpected\r\nsituation. In 1872 epizootic among the horses so upset things in the Oil\r\nRegions that for a short time an immediate shipment order was enforced.\r\nIn 1874, when the pipe-lines were overtaxed by a great outpouring of oil\r\nin the Lower Field, immediate shipment had been attempted, but at that\r\ntime there were still so many independent pipes struggling for business\r\nthat the movement met no success. Now, however, the United Pipe Lines\r\nhad things its own way. That they were not ready to meet the growing\r\nBradford production is plain from a study of the figures. There were in\r\nthe Oil Regions at the close of 1877, according to the Oil City Derrick,\r\n4,000,000 barrels of tankage. There was on hand at this time 3,127,837\r\nbarrels of oil, but the empty tankage was in the wrong place. In the\r\nBradford field, where the daily production had suddenly increased from\r\n2,000 barrels in January to 8,451 barrels in December, there was only a\r\nlittle over 200,000 barrels of tankage.[66] In order to take care of the\r\noil the pipe-lines began to make nearly all their shipments from that\r\nfield, and oil piled up in the Lower Region to the great dissatisfaction\r\nof the producers there.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the situation of the Bradford field was realised both the\r\nUnited Pipes and the producers began a furious campaign of tank\r\nbuilding. By the beginning of April, 1878, the tankage there had been\r\nincreased to 1,152,028 barrels.[67] Between April 1 and November 1\r\nseventy tanks of from 10,000 to 25,000 barrels capacity were built in\r\nMcKean County. The greater number of these belonged to the producers.\r\nAccording to the United Pipe Lines’ statement, there was under their\r\ncontrol in the entire Oil Regions in October 5,200,000 barrels of\r\ntankage, two-thirds of which belonged to producers, but was held by them\r\nunder a lease.[68] But oil poured from the ground faster than tanks\r\ncould be built. In six months—that is, by July, 1878,—the daily output\r\nof Bradford had become over 18,000 barrels, an increase of 10,000\r\nbarrels a day over that of the previous December. That it was a most\r\ndifficult situation for everybody is evident. There was but one way to\r\nprevent loss—shut down the wells and stop the drill; but this the\r\nproducers refused to consider. Of course the price of oil went down\r\nrapidly, so far did the production exceed consumption. But why, cried\r\nthe producer, when oil is already so low, take advantage of our\r\nnecessity and force us into competition with each other; why enforce\r\nthis immediate shipment? They answered their question themselves, and\r\nbegan then to make a charge against the Standard, which they continue to\r\nmake to-day; that is, that it habitually meets the extraordinary\r\nexpenses to which it is put by depressing the price of crude oil—“taking\r\nit out of the producer.” The Bradford region demanded great investments,\r\ntherefore immediate shipment. “The producer pays.” The writer has no\r\ndocumentary proof that this is Mr. Rockefeller’s policy, but there is no\r\nquestion that the Oil Region believes it is, and this belief must be\r\ntaken into account if one attempts to explain the long warfare of the\r\noil country on him and his company. It is a common enough thing to-day,\r\nindeed, to hear oil producers in Northwestern Pennsylvania remark\r\nfacetiously when a new endowment to Chicago University is reported:\r\n“Yes, I contributed so much on such a day. Don’t you remember how the\r\nmarket slumped without a cause? The university needed the money, and so\r\nMr. Rockefeller called on us to stand and deliver.”\r\n\r\nA few months after “immediate shipment” was begun a new cause for\r\ndissatisfaction arose. More or less private tankage leased to the lines\r\nhad always been in existence. It enabled a producer to carry his oil\r\nwithout paying storage, and, of course, it was the business of the\r\ncompany to empty this storage within a reasonable time after the owner\r\ndemanded it. But in the spring the lines, under the same plea of under\r\ncapacity, refused to carry out this duty to the tank owner; that is,\r\nthey refused to give him his tankage, although he had sold his oil. Thus\r\nA owns 5,000 barrels of tankage. It is full. He sells a portion of it to\r\nMr. Bostwick and asks the United Pipe Lines to run the oil accumulated\r\nat his wells. But the United Pipe Lines refuses on the ground that the\r\nline is full. The loss to producers incident upon these orders was\r\nterrible. All over the Bradford field men saw their oil running on the\r\nground, though they offered to sell it at ruinous prices, and though\r\nthey might have thousands of barrels of tankage leased to the United\r\nLines. Yet they did not riot; conscious that their own reckless drilling\r\nhad brought on the trouble, they cursed the Standard, and put down more\r\nwells!\r\n\r\nBut in the spring of 1878 Mr. Rockefeller and his colleagues instituted\r\na series of manœuvres which shattered the last remnant of confidence the\r\noil men had in the sincerity of their claim that they were doing their\r\nutmost to relieve the distressed Oil Regions, and that their measures\r\nwere necessary to hold the producers in check. The pipe-lines began to\r\nrefuse to load cars for the shippers who supplied the few independent\r\nrefiners with oil. The experiences of many of these independent oil men\r\nhave been told before the courts. For instance, W. H. Nicholson, the\r\nrepresentative of Mr. Ohlen, of New York, a shipper of petroleum,\r\ntestified[69] that in May, 1878, he began to have difficulty in getting\r\ncars. At Olean, one day, Mr. Ohlen telegraphed to the officials of the\r\nErie road to know if he could get 100 cars to run East. The reply came\r\nback, Yes. About noon, Mr. Nicholson says, he saw Mr. O’Day, the manager\r\nof the United Pipe Lines, in which his oil was stored, and told him that\r\nhe was waiting to have his cars loaded. Mr. O’Day at once said he could\r\nnot load the cars. “But I have an order from the Erie officials, giving\r\nme the cars,” Mr. Nicholson objected. “That makes no difference,” O’Day\r\nreplied; “I cannot load cars except upon an order from Pratt.” Nor would\r\nhe do it. The cars were not loaded for Mr. Nicholson, although at that\r\ntime he had ten thousand barrels of oil in the United Pipe Lines, and an\r\norder for 100 cars from the officials of the Erie road in his hand.\r\n\r\nB. B. Campbell, at that time president of the Producers’ Union, gave his\r\nexperience at this time in the suit of the Commonwealth against the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I never heard of a scarcity of cars until the early part of June,\r\n  1878; I came to Parker about five o’clock in the evening, and found\r\n  the citizens in a state of terrible excitement; the Pipe-Lines would\r\n  not run oil unless it was sold; the only shippers we had in Parker\r\n  of any amount, viz., the agents of the Standard Oil Company, would\r\n  not buy oil, stating that they could not get cars; hundreds of wells\r\n  were stopped to their great injury; thousands more, whose owners\r\n  were afraid to stop them for fear of damage by salt-water, were\r\n  pumping the oil on the ground. I used all the influence I had to\r\n  prevent an outbreak and destruction of railroad and pipe-lines; I at\r\n  once went over to the Allegheny Valley Railroad office and\r\n  telegraphed to John Scott, president of the Allegheny Valley\r\n  Railroad Company:\r\n\r\n  “‘The refusal of the United to run oil unless sold upon immediate\r\n  shipment, and of the railroad to furnish cars, has created such a\r\n  degree of excitement here that the more conservative part of the\r\n  citizens will not be able to control the peace, and I fear that the\r\n  scenes of last July will be repeated on an aggravated scale.’ That\r\n  message I left in the office about seven o’clock in the evening. I\r\n  got up the next morning before seven and received an answer:\r\n\r\n  “‘What do you advise should be done? John Scott.’ I answered: ‘Will\r\n  meet you to-morrow morning,’ which would be Saturday.\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday morning I came in on an early train and met at the\r\n  depot Mr. Shinn, then, I believe, vice-president of the Allegheny\r\n  Valley Railroad Company, David A. Stewart, one of the directors of\r\n  the road, and Thomas M. King, assistant superintendent. I spoke very\r\n  plainly to Mr. Shinn, telling him that the idea of a scarcity of\r\n  cars on daily shipments of less than 30,000 barrels a day was such\r\n  an absurd, barefaced pretence that he could not expect men of\r\n  ordinary intelligence to accept it, as the preceding fall, when\r\n  business required, the railroads could carry day after day from\r\n  50,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil. Mr. Shinn stated clearly that I\r\n  knew that the Allegheny Valley Railroad Company did not control the\r\n  oil business over its line, but was governed entirely and\r\n  exclusively by orders received from the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  Company. I then requested him to be the vehicle of communicating to\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad officials my views on the subject, telling\r\n  him that I was convinced that unless immediate relief was furnished\r\n  and cars afforded there would be an outbreak in the Oil Regions.\r\n  After further conversation we parted. My interview with them was not\r\n  as officials of the Allegheny Valley Railroad Company, but as\r\n  representatives of the oil traffic carried and controlled by the\r\n  Pennsylvania road. On the next Monday I returned to Parker. After\r\n  passing Redbank, where the low-grade road, the connecting link\r\n  between the Valley Road and the Philadelphia and Erie Road, meets\r\n  the Valley Road—between that point and Parker—the express train was\r\n  delayed for over half an hour in passing through _hundreds of empty\r\n  oil cars_.”[70]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June another exasperating episode occurred, growing out of the\r\nattempts of the oil men to secure independent routes to the seaboard. As\r\nwe have seen, two enterprises had been launched late in 1877 under the\r\npatronage of the Petroleum Producers’ Union. As soon as the Equitable\r\nhad acquired its right of way to Buffalo, Mr. Emery, the head of the\r\ncompany, his papers in hand, sought an interview with representatives of\r\nthe Buffalo and McKean road, and told them if they did not consent that\r\nthe Equitable lay a pipe-line to their road, and did not contract to\r\ncarry the oil from that connection to Buffalo, the pipe-line to Buffalo\r\nwould be laid. After considerable negotiation a contract was made with\r\nthe railroad, and by June the new company was ready with pipe-line, cars\r\nand barges to carry oil to New York. But no sooner did they attempt to\r\nbegin operations than the railroad, under pressure from the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad it was claimed, refused to carry out its contracts. The cars\r\nthe Equitable ordered sent to the loading track were refused, a side\r\ntrack it had laid was torn up, the frog torn out; everything, indeed,\r\nwas done to prevent the Equitable doing business, though finally a\r\nvigorous appeal to the law brought the road to terms, and in July oil\r\nbegan to flow Eastward by this indirect route. No sooner did the\r\nStandard find that the Equitable people were really doing business than\r\nthey appealed to the railroads. A meeting of the representatives of the\r\ntrunk lines was held at Saratoga in July, and the rates on crude\r\nEastward were dropped to eighty cents to meet the new competition.\r\n\r\nWhile this fight was going on against the Equitable all sorts of\r\ninterference were being put in the way of the seaboard line between\r\nBrady’s Bend and Baltimore. It was ridiculed as chimerical to attempt to\r\npump oil over the mountains, and General Haupt was declared to be a\r\nvisionary engineer with a record of failures. All the old stories\r\nretailed in 1876 were dragged out again. The farmers were told that the\r\nleakage from the pipe-line would ruin their fields and endanger their\r\nbuildings, and an active campaign to excite prejudice was carried on\r\nagain in the farmers’ papers. Philadelphia and Pittsburg both fought the\r\nplan, the press and chambers of commerce opposing the free pipe bill at\r\nthat time before the Legislature, and the project generally. In\r\nPittsburg the opposition created almost a riot, for the oil producers of\r\nthe Lower Field, who had long bought their supplies there, now\r\nthreatened to boycott the city if the pipe-line was fought. So strong\r\nwas the opposition that capital took fright and the company found it\r\nmost difficult to secure funds. This opposition to the pipe-line was, of\r\ncourse, charged against the Standard and the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\nNow, while the railroads were refusing cars to independent shippers,—or\r\nif they gave an order for them, the United Pipe Lines were refusing to\r\nload them,—while the Standard and the railroads were doing their utmost\r\nto prevent the Equitable Line doing business, and were discouraging in\r\nevery way the seaboard pipe-line—new routes which would take care of a\r\nproportion, at least, of the oil which they claimed they could not\r\nhandle—thousands of barrels of oil were running on the ground in\r\nBradford, and two of the independent refineries of New York shut down\r\nentirely in order that a third of their number might get oil enough to\r\nfill an order.\r\n\r\nThis interference with the outside interests, thus preventing the small\r\ndegree of relief which they would have afforded, and a growing\r\nconviction that the Standard meant to keep up the “immediate shipment”\r\norder, at least until it had built the pipes and tanks needed in the\r\nBradford field, finally aroused the region to a point where riot was\r\nimminent. The long line of producers who filed into the United Pipe\r\nLines’ office day after day to sell their oil at whatever prices they\r\ncould get for it, and who, having put in an offer which varied according\r\nto their necessities, were usually told to come back in ten days, and\r\nthe buyer would see whether he wanted it or not—this long line of men\r\nbegan to talk of revolution. Crowds gathered about the offices of the\r\nStandard threatening and jeering. Mysterious things, cross-bones and\r\ndeath-heads, were found plentifully sprinkled on the buildings owned by\r\nthe Standard interests. More than once the slumber of the oil towns was\r\ndisturbed by marching bodies of men. It was certain that a species of\r\nKuklux had hold of the Bradford region, and that a very little spark was\r\nneeded to touch off the United Pipe Lines. In the meantime things were\r\nscarcely less exciting in the Lower Fields. The “immediate shipment”\r\norder was looked upon there as particularly outrageous, because there\r\nwas no lack of lines or tanks in that field, and when, in the summer of\r\n1878, there was added to this cause an unjustifiable scarcity of cars,\r\nexcitement rose to fever heat.\r\n\r\nThe only thing which prevented a riot at this time and great destruction\r\nof property, if not of life, was the strong hand the Petroleum\r\nProducers’ Union had on the country. Fearing that if violence did occur\r\nthe different movements they had under way would be prejudiced, they\r\nsent a committee of twenty-five men to Harrisburg to see Governor\r\nHartranft. They laid before him and the attorney-general of the state\r\nthe grievance of the oil producers in an “appeal” reviewing the history\r\nof the industry.[71] They demanded that the United Pipe Lines be made to\r\nperform its duty as a public carrier, and the railroads be made to cease\r\ntheir discrimination against shippers both in the matter of rebates and\r\nin furnishing cars. They called the Governor’s attention to the fact\r\nthat there were already existing laws touching these matters which, in\r\ntheir judgment, met the case, and if the existing laws did not give them\r\nrelief, that it was the plain duty of the executive to call a meeting of\r\nthe Legislature and pass such acts as would do so. Governor Hartranft\r\nwas much stirred by the story of the producers. He went himself to the\r\nOil Regions to see the situation, and in August directed the producers\r\nto put their demands into the form of an appeal. This was done, and it\r\nwas decided to bring proceedings by writ of _quo warranto_ against the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines, and by separate bills in equity against the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad and the other lines doing business in the state.\r\nIt was September before the state authorities began their investigation\r\nof the United Pipe Lines, the hearings being held in Titusville. Many\r\nwitnesses summoned failed to appear, but enough testimony was brought\r\nout in this investigation to show that the railroads had refused to\r\nfurnish cars for independents when they had them empty, and that the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines had clearly violated its duty as a common carrier. In\r\nhis report on this investigation the secretary of internal affairs,\r\nWilliam McCandless, rendered a verdict that the charges of the oil\r\nproducers had not been substantiated in any way that demanded action.\r\n\r\nThe indignation which followed this report was intense. It found a vent\r\nin the hanging in effigy of McCandless, who was universally known in the\r\nstate as “Buck.” In the oil exchange at Parker, on the morning of\r\nOctober 19, the figure of a man was found hanged by the neck to a\r\ngallows, and the producers left it hanging there all day, so that they\r\nmight jeer and curse it. Across the forehead of the effigy in large\r\nblood-red letters were the words:\r\n\r\n                      ...........................\r\n                      .                         .\r\n                      .  PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD  .\r\n                      .                         .\r\n                      ...........................\r\n\r\nPinned to the gallows there was a card bearing a quotation from\r\nSecretary McCandless’s report:\r\n\r\n         .....................................................\r\n         .                                                   .\r\n         .   The charges of the oil producers have not been  .\r\n         .  substantiated in any way that demands action.    .\r\n         .                                                   .\r\n         .....................................................\r\n\r\nIn Bradford a huge effigy hung in the streets all day, and in the\r\nvillage of Tarport, near by, another swayed on the gallows. They pulled\r\ndown the effigy at Bradford, and drew from a pocket what purported to be\r\na check signed by John D. Rockefeller, president of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, in favour of “Buck” McCandless, for $20,000, and endorsed by\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad Company. That represented the price, they\r\nsaid, that McCandless got for signing the report. Throughout the oil\r\ncountry there was hardly an oil producer to be found not associated with\r\nthe Standard Oil Company who did not believe that McCandless had sold\r\nhimself and his office to the Standard Oil Combination for $20,000, and\r\nused the money to help in his Congressional canvass.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in the Oil Regions spread all over the country. Something\r\nof the importance the press attached to it may be judged from the way\r\nthe New York Sun handled the question. For six weeks it kept one of the\r\nablest members of its staff in the Oil Regions. Six columns of the first\r\npage of the issue for November 13 was taken up with the story of the\r\nexcitement, coupled with the full account of the South Improvement\r\nCompany, and the development of the Standard Oil Company out of that\r\nconcern. On November 23 the first page contained four columns more under\r\nblazing headings.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1879 the hearing in the suits in equity brought by the\r\ncommonwealth against the various transportation companies of which the\r\nproducers had been complaining were begun. The witnesses subpœnaed\r\nfailed at first to appear, and when on the stand they frequently refused\r\nto reply; but it soon became apparent to them that the state authorities\r\nwere in earnest, and that they must “answer or go to Europe.” By March,\r\n1879, an important array of testimony had been brought out. Among the\r\nStandard men who had appeared had been John D. Archbold, William Frew,\r\nCharles Lockhart and J. J. Vandergrift. A score or more of producers\r\nalso appeared. The most important witness from the railroad circles,\r\nand, indeed, the most important witness who appeared, was A. J. Cassatt.\r\nMr. Cassatt’s testimony was startling in its candour and its\r\ncompleteness, and substantiated in every particular what the oil men had\r\nbeen claiming: that the Pennsylvania Railroad had become the creature of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company; that it was not only giving that company rates\r\nmuch lower than to any other organisation, but that it was using its\r\nfacilities with a direct view of preventing any outside refiner or\r\ndealer in oil from carrying on an independent business.[72]\r\n\r\nThe same or similar conditions, not only in oil, but in other products,\r\nwhich led to these suits, led to investigations in other states. Toward\r\nthe end of 1878 the Chamber of Commerce of New York City demanded from\r\nthe Legislature of the state an investigation of the New York railroads.\r\nThis investigation was carried on from the beginning of 1879. The\r\nrevelations were amazing. Before the Hepburn Commission, as it was\r\ncalled from the name of the chairman, was through with its work there\r\nhad appeared before it to give testimony in regard to the conduct of the\r\nStandard Oil Company and of the relation of the Erie and the Central\r\nroads to it, H. H. Rogers, J. D. Archbold, Jabez A. Bostwick and W. T.\r\nSheide. A large number of independent oil men had also appeared. William\r\nH. Vanderbilt had been examined, and G. H. Blanchard, the freight agent\r\nof the Erie road, had given a full account of the relation of the Erie\r\nto the Standard, perhaps the most useful piece of testimony, after that\r\nof Mr. Cassatt, belonging to this period of the Standard’s history.[73]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the Pennsylvania suits were going on, and the\r\nHepburn Commission was doing its work, the Legislature of Ohio\r\ninstituted an investigation. It was commonly charged that this\r\ninvestigation was smothered, but it was not smothered until H. M.\r\nFlagler had appeared before it and given some most interesting facts\r\nconcerning rebates. A number of gentlemen who were finding it hard to do\r\noil business also appeared before the Ohio committee and told their\r\nstories.[74] By April, 1879, there had been brought out in these various\r\ninvestigations a mass of testimony sufficient in the judgment of certain\r\nof the producers to establish the truth of a charge which they had long\r\nbeen making, and that was that the Standard was simply a revival of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company. Now the verdict of the Congressional\r\nCommittee had been that the South Improvement Company was a conspiracy.\r\nTherefore, said the producers, the Standard Oil Company is a conspiracy.\r\nTheir hope had been, from the first, to obtain proof to establish this\r\ncharge. Having this they believed they could obtain judgment from the\r\ncourts against the officials of the company, and either break it up or\r\nput its members in the penitentiary. The more hotheaded of the producers\r\nbelieved that they now had this evidence.\r\n\r\nIf one will examine the testimony which had been given thus far in the\r\ncourse of the various examinations one will see that there was reason\r\nfor their belief. In the first place, it had been established that all\r\nthe stockholders of the South Improvement Company, excepting four, were\r\nnow members of the Standard Oil Combination. Indeed, the only persons\r\nholding high positions in the new combination at this date who were not\r\nSouth Improvement Company men were, Charles Pratt, J. J. Vandergrift, H.\r\nH. Rogers and John D. Archbold.\r\n\r\nThe South Improvement Company had been a secret organisation. So was the\r\nnew Standard alliance; that is, the most strenuous efforts had been made\r\nto keep it secret; for instance, the sale of the works of Lockhart,\r\nWarden and Pratt to the Standard was kept from the public. Indeed, it\r\nwas a year after these sales before even the Erie Railroad knew that Mr.\r\nRockefeller had any affiliations besides those with Pratt and Company,\r\nand it made its contracts with him on this assumption. When purchases of\r\nrefineries were made it was the custom to continue the business under\r\nthe name of the original concern; thus, when Mrs. B., of Cleveland, sold\r\nin 1878, as recounted in the last chapter, the persons selling were\r\nobliged to keep the sale secret even from the employees of the concern.\r\n“The understanding was with regard to the sale of the property to the\r\nStandard Oil Company,” said the shipping clerk in his affidavit, “that\r\nit should not be known outside of their own parties, that it was to be\r\nkept a profound secret, and that the business was to be carried on as if\r\nthe B—— Oil Company was still a competitor.” The secret rites with which\r\nthe contract was made in 1876 between Mr. Rockefeller and Scofield,\r\nShurmer and Teagle have already been described.\r\n\r\nTo keep the relations of the various Standard concerns secret Mr.\r\nRockefeller went so far, in 1880, as to make an affidavit like the\r\nfollowing: “It is not true, as stated by Mr. Teagle in his affidavit,\r\nthat the Standard Oil Company, directly or indirectly through its\r\nofficers or agents, owns or controls the works of Warden, Frew and\r\nCompany, Lockhart, Frew and Company, J. A. Bostwick and Company, C.\r\nPratt and Company, Acme Refining Company, Imperial Refining Company,\r\nCamden Consolidated Company, and the Devoe Manufacturing Company; nor is\r\nit true that the Standard Oil Company, directly or indirectly through\r\nits officers or agents, owns or controls the refinery at Hunter’s Point,\r\nNew York. It is not true that the Standard Oil Company, directly or\r\nindirectly through its officers or agents, purchased or acquired the\r\nEmpire Transportation Company, or furnished the money therefor; nor is\r\nit true that the Standard Oil Company inaugurated or began or induced\r\nany other person or corporation to inaugurate or begin a war upon the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Company or the Empire Transportation Company, as\r\nstated in the affidavit of Mr. Teagle.”[75]\r\n\r\nThere may be a technical explanation of this affidavit, although the\r\nwriter knows of none. There is certainly abundant testimony in existence\r\nthat the works of Messrs. Pratt, Lockhart and Warden, at least, had been\r\nbought long before this affidavit was made, and paid for in Standard Oil\r\nCompany stock, and that they were working in alliance with that company.\r\nIt was shown in the last chapter that on October 17, 1877, the Standard\r\nOil Company paid $2,500,000 in certified checks on the purchasing price\r\nof the plant of the Empire Transportation Company.\r\n\r\nWhile none of the other members of the Standard Oil Company examined in\r\n1879 was quite so sweeping in his denials, all of them evaded direct\r\nanswers. The reason they gave for this evasion was that the\r\ninvestigations were an interference with their rights as private\r\ncitizens, and that the government had no business to inquire into their\r\nmethods. Consequently when asked questions they refused to answer “by\r\nadvice of counsel.” Ultimately the gentlemen did answer a great many\r\nquestions. But taking the testimony all in all through these years it\r\ncertainly is a mild characterisation to say that it totally lacks in\r\nfrankness. The testimony of the Standard officials before the Hepburn\r\nCommission was so evasive that the committee in making its report spoke\r\nbitterly of the company as “a mysterious organisation whose business and\r\ntransactions are of such a character that its members decline giving a\r\nhistory or description of it lest this testimony be used to convict them\r\nof a crime.” The producers certainly were right in claiming that secrecy\r\nwas a characteristic of the Standard as it had been of the South\r\nImprovement Company.\r\n\r\nThe new Standard Combination, like the South Improvement Company, aimed\r\nat controlling the entire refining interest. “The coal-oil business\r\nbelongs to us,” Mr. Rockefeller once told a recalcitrant refiner. His\r\nassociates were saying the same on all sides; “the object of the\r\nStandard Oil Company is to secure the entire refining business of the\r\nworld,” a member of the concern told B. F. Nye, an Ohio producer.[76]\r\n\r\nThe method the Standard depended upon to secure this control was the\r\nsame as the method of the South Improvement Company—special privileges\r\nin transportation. We have seen how intelligently and persistently Mr.\r\nRockefeller worked to secure these special privileges until, in 1877, he\r\nhad made with all the trunk lines contracts which in every particular\r\nparalleled the contracts which in January, 1872, Messrs. Scott, Gould,\r\nVanderbilt and McClellan made with the South Improvement Company. He now\r\nhad a rebate on every barrel of oil he shipped, and this was given with\r\nthe understanding that the railroad should allow no rebate to any other\r\nshipper unless that shipper could guarantee and furnish a quantity of\r\noil for shipment which would, after deduction of his commission, realise\r\nto the road the same amount of profit realised from the Standard trade.\r\nHe also had a drawback on every barrel his rivals shipped. No clause in\r\nthe South Improvement Company’s contract with railroads had given more\r\noffence to the oil world than that which called for a drawback to the\r\ncompany on the oil shipped by outsiders. It will be remembered that the\r\nbeneficiaries of this contract were to receive drawbacks of $1.06 a\r\nbarrel on all crude oil that outside parties shipped from the Oil\r\nRegions to New York, and a proportionate drawback on that shipped from\r\nother points. The rebate system was considered illegal and unjust, but\r\nmen were more or less accustomed to it. The drawback on other people’s\r\nshipment was a new device, and it threw the Oil Region into a frenzy of\r\nrage. It did not seem possible that the Standard would attempt to revive\r\nthis practice again, and yet when it had got its hand strongly on the\r\nfour trunk lines it made a demand for the drawback. It has already been\r\nrecounted how, on February 15, 1878, four months after the Pennsylvania\r\nsuccumbed to the Standard’s demand, Mr. O’Day wrote to Mr. Cassatt: “I\r\nhere repeat what I once stated to you, and which I wish you to receive\r\nand treat as strictly confidential, that we have been for many months\r\nreceiving from the New York Central and Erie Railroads certain sums of\r\nmoney, in no instance less than twenty cents per barrel on _every barrel\r\nof crude oil carried by each of these roads_.... Co-operating as we are\r\ndoing with the Standard Oil Company and the trunk lines in every effort\r\nto secure for the railroads paying rates of freight on the oil they\r\ncarry, I am constrained to say to you that in justice to the interests I\r\nrepresent we should receive from your company at least twenty cents on\r\neach barrel of crude oil you transport.” And Mr. Cassatt after seeing\r\nthe freight bills showing that both the Central and Erie allowed a\r\ndrawback gave orders that the Pennsylvania pay one of 22½ cents. When\r\nMr. Cassatt was under examination in 1874 the examiner remarked:\r\n\r\n“I understand, Mr. Cassatt, that this 22½ cents paid to the American\r\nTransfer Company is not restricted to all oil that passed through their\r\nlines.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; it is paid on all oil received and transferred by us.”\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting documents presented at this inquiry was a\r\nstatement of the crude oil shipments over the Pennsylvania road for\r\nFebruary and March, 1878.[77] They footed up to a total of 343,767½\r\nbarrels. On this amount a discount of twenty cents a barrel was allowed\r\nto the Standard Oil Company through its agent, the American Transfer\r\nCompany. Among other independents who shipped this oil was H. C. Ohlen.\r\nIn all, Mr. Ohlen shipped 29,876 barrels, and on this the Standard Oil\r\nCompany received twenty cents a barrel! That is, after Mr. Ohlen had\r\npaid for his oil, paid for having it carried by the pipe-line to the\r\nrailroad, and paid the railroad the full rate of freight without the\r\ncommission the Standard received, the Pennsylvania was obliged to turn\r\nover to the Standard Oil Company twenty cents of the amount he had paid\r\non each barrel!\r\n\r\nThe examiner tried very hard to find out if there was a legitimate\r\nreason why such an allowance should have been made to the American\r\nTransfer Company on oil it did not handle. “We pay that,” Mr. Cassatt\r\nsaid, “as a commission to them to aid in securing us our share of\r\ntrade.” “We pay it,” said the comptroller, “for procuring oil to go over\r\nthe lines in which the Pennsylvania Railroad Company is interested as\r\nagainst the New York lines and the New York Central.”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand,” the examiner questioned of one of the auditors,\r\n“that the American Transfer Company secured to the Pennsylvania road the\r\ntraffic of the outside refiners of New York (mentioned in the statement\r\nquoted above)?” “I never raised a question of that kind in my mind,”\r\nanswered the adroit auditor.\r\n\r\nBut the answer was evident. The American Transfer Company had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with the oil shipped by Mr. Ohlen or Ayres, Lombard and\r\nCompany or J. Rousseaux or any one of the other independents mentioned\r\nin the statement, unless perchance that oil had come originally from the\r\nlines of the American Transfer Company. In that case the shipper had\r\npaid the line for the service rendered, at the time he bought the\r\noil—the custom then and now. The tax was paid by the Pennsylvania solely\r\nbecause the Standard Oil Company had the power to demand it. The demand\r\nwas made in the name of the American Transfer Company as a blind.\r\nNaturally the proof that the Standard had revived the most obnoxious\r\nfeature of the South Improvement Company aroused intense bitterness and\r\ndisgust among the oil men.\r\n\r\nAnother offensive clause of the 1872 contracts was that pledging the\r\nrailroads to lower or raise the gross rates of transportation for such\r\ntimes and to such extent as might be necessary to overcome competition.\r\nNow, the new contracts of the Standard provided the same arrangement;\r\nthat is, they stipulated that the rates were to be lowered if necessary\r\nso as to place the Standard on a parity with shippers by competing\r\nlines. The workings of the clause were illustrated when the producers\r\ngot the Equitable Line through in 1878, the railroads dropping their\r\ncharge to eighty cents a barrel, and in some cases even less. The\r\nproducers certainly had evidence enough for their claim that the\r\ncontracts of the South Improvement Company and the Standard Oil Company\r\nwith the railroads were similar in every particular as far as principles\r\nwere concerned—that they differed alone in the amounts of the rebates\r\nand drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of evidence brought out, also, to show that the object\r\nof the Standard operations was like that of the South Improvement\r\nCompany—keeping up the price of refined oil. Both combinations were\r\nformed to keep the refined article scarce on the market by controlling\r\nall the refineries and by refusing to sell under competition. The\r\nofficials of the South Improvement Company stated under oath that they\r\nhoped to raise the price fifty per cent. The Central Organisation hoped\r\nto put up the price of refined from fifteen to twenty-five cents. As a\r\nmatter of fact that organisation when it finally got control of the\r\nmarket put up the price considerably more. The spectacular demonstration\r\nin the winter of 1876 and 1877 of what could be done in keeping up the\r\nprice of refined was still rankling in the minds of the oil men. They\r\nsaw that it was by that coup that the Standard had gotten the ready\r\nmoney to pay for the plant of the Empire Transportation Company—the\r\nmoney to buy in whatever it wanted—the money to pay the fifty per cent.\r\ndividend to which one of its members testified in the Ohio\r\nInvestigation. They remembered that while the refiners had been selling\r\nrefined around thirty cents a gallon they had sold crude at less than\r\nfour dollars a barrel. Little wonder then that they felt they had\r\nevidence that the Standard had actually done what they had always\r\nclaimed it would do if it got hold of the refining interests as it\r\nplanned. Even in the case where certain large producers had entered into\r\na partnership with the Standard on condition that they pay them prices\r\nfor crude commensurate with the price of refined, these producers\r\nclaimed the agreement had not been kept. One of these cases came to\r\nlight in a suit instituted in 1878. It seems that some time in December,\r\n1874, the large oil company of H. L. Taylor and Company sold one-half\r\ninterest in its property to the Standard Oil Company. The reason for the\r\nsale the plaintiffs stated in their complaint to be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The extent of their (the Standard’s) business and control over\r\n  pipe-lines and refineries had enabled them to procure, and they had\r\n  procured from the railways, more favourable terms for transportation\r\n  than others could obtain. These advantages and facilities placed it\r\n  within their power to obtain, and they did obtain, far better and\r\n  more uniform prices for petroleum than could be obtained by the\r\n  plaintiffs. The said organisation and firms, by virtue of their\r\n  monopoly of the business of refining and transportation of oil, had\r\n  been at times almost the only buyers in the market, and at such\r\n  times had been enabled to dictate and establish a price for crude\r\n  oil far below its actual value, as determined by prices of refined\r\n  oil at same dates, and they thus obtained a large share of the\r\n  profits which should have fallen to the plaintiffs and other\r\n  purchasers. The sale was made, and in consideration of the foregoing\r\n  premises, and upon the promise and agreement on the part of the\r\n  defendants that the partnership thus formed should have the benefit\r\n  of the advantage and facilities of the said defendants, and the\r\n  organisations and firms managed and controlled by defendants, in\r\n  marketing its oil; that the firm should have to the extent of its\r\n  production the advantage of the sales of refined by the defendants\r\n  or said Standard Oil Company, either for present or future delivery,\r\n  so that there should be at no time any margin or difference between\r\n  the ruling price of refined oil, and the price which defendants\r\n  would pay the partnership for the crude by it produced, beyond the\r\n  necessary cost of refining. This thing formed the inducement and the\r\n  larger part of the consideration for the sale of said property to\r\n  defendants. The amount actually received for said interest was far\r\n  beneath its actual value, and without the agreement on the part of\r\n  the defendants to pay to the partnership for its product prices at\r\n  all times commensurate with the prices of refined oil, they would\r\n  not have sold the said interest nor entered into said partnership.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The defendants, although requested to do so, have not only failed,\r\n  neglected, and refused to comply with this agreement, but have, by\r\n  false and erroneous statements, misled the plaintiffs, and induced\r\n  them to consent to the sale to them and to the Standard Oil Company\r\n  of large quantities of crude petroleum, produced by the partnership\r\n  at prices far below its actual value, to the great loss and damage\r\n  of the orators. That on or about December 16, 1876, refined was\r\n  selling at a price equivalent to seven dollars for crude oil, at\r\n  which time plaintiffs called upon defendants for a compliance with\r\n  their agreement, and asked that they take or purchase 210,000\r\n  barrels of the production of the partnership at a price commensurate\r\n  with the price of refined at the time. This, defendants neglected\r\n  and refused to do, and the partnership was forced to sell the same\r\n  at prices varying from three to four dollars, making a loss to the\r\n  partnership upon this one transaction of from $600,000 to\r\n  $1,000,000, for which said defendants neglect and refuse to account.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  That the said defendants for themselves, and for the said Standard\r\n  Oil Company, and other organisations and firms aforesaid, have since\r\n  the formation of the partnership received from the railways a rebate\r\n  or drawback in the shape of wheelage, or otherwise, at times as high\r\n  as one dollar per barrel upon all oil shipped by them to the\r\n  seaboard. That instead of using these advantages which they possess\r\n  for the benefit and profit of the partnership, as they covenanted to\r\n  do, they have used them against its interest by restraining trade,\r\n  preventing competition, and forcing plaintiffs to accept any price\r\n  which defendants, the said Standard Oil Company, or the other\r\n  organisations aforesaid, might offer for their production. That the\r\n  amount of oil produced and sold by the partnership for the three\r\n  years beginning with the date of its formation, and ending December\r\n  1, 1877, was 2,657,830 barrels. That the profits of defendants upon\r\n  oil refined by them during said period, taking into consideration\r\n  the rebates and drawbacks received from the railways, have averaged\r\n  at least one dollar per barrel over and above the cost of refining,\r\n  and at times as high as four and five dollars. That these profits,\r\n  under the partnership agreement that no margin should exist between\r\n  crude and refined prices, should to the extent of the production of\r\n  the partnership have been paid by defendants to the partnership.\r\n  That the amount lost by the partnership and realised by the\r\n  defendants, by reason of the failure and refusal of said defendants\r\n  to comply with their agreement, is not less than $2,500,000, for\r\n  one-half of which defendants should account to your orators, but\r\n  which they neglect and refuse to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally enough the producers now pointed out that the case of the H.\r\nL. Taylor Company was a demonstration of what they had claimed in 1872,\r\nwhen the South Improvement Company, alarmed at the uprising, offered\r\nthem a contract, and what they had always claimed since when the\r\nStandard offered contracts for oil on a sliding scale, viz., that such\r\ncontracts were never meant to be kept; that they were a blind to enable\r\nthe Standard to make scoops such as they had made in the winter of 1876\r\nand 1877.\r\n\r\nTaking all these points into consideration—\r\n\r\nFirst—That the Standard Oil Company, like the South Improvement Company,\r\nwas a secret organisation;\r\n\r\nSecond—That both companies were composed in the main of the same\r\nparties;\r\n\r\nThird—That it aimed, like its predecessors, at getting entire control of\r\nthe refining interest;\r\n\r\nFourth—That it used the power the combination gave it to get rebates on\r\nits own oil shipments and drawbacks on the shipments of other people;\r\n\r\nFifth—That it arranged contracts which compelled the railroads to run\r\nout all competition by lowering their rates.\r\n\r\nSixth—That it aimed to put up the price of refined without allowing the\r\nproducer a share of the profits—\r\n\r\nTaking all these points into consideration, many of the producers,\r\nincluding the president of the Petroleum Producers’ Union, B. B.\r\nCampbell, and certain members of his Council, came to the conclusion\r\nthat as they had sufficient evidence against the members of the Standard\r\nCombination to insure conviction for criminal conspiracy, they should\r\nproceed against them. Strenuous opposition to the proceedings, as hasty\r\nand ill-advised, developed in the Council and the Legal Committee, but\r\nthe majority decided that the prosecution should be instituted. Mr.\r\nScott and Mr. Cassatt were omitted from the proposed indictment on the\r\nground that they were already weary of the Standard, and would cease\r\ntheir illegal practices gladly if they could.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th day of April, 1879, the Grand Jury of the County of Clarion\r\nfound an indictment against John D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller,\r\nJabez A. Bostwick, Daniel O’Day, William G. Warden, Charles Lockhart,\r\nHenry M. Flagler, Jacob J. Vandergrift and George W. Girty. (Girty was\r\nthe cashier of the Standard Oil Company.) There were eight counts in the\r\nindictment, and charged, in brief, a conspiracy for the purpose of\r\nsecuring a monopoly of the business of buying and selling crude\r\npetroleum, and to prevent others than themselves from buying and selling\r\nand making a legitimate profit thereby; a combination to oppress and\r\ninjure those engaged in producing petroleum; a conspiracy to prevent\r\nothers than themselves from engaging in the business of refining\r\npetroleum, and to secure a monopoly of that business for themselves; a\r\ncombination to injure the carrying trade of the Allegheny Valley and\r\nPennsylvania Railroad Companies by preventing them from receiving the\r\nnatural petroleum traffic; to divert the traffic naturally belonging to\r\nthe Pennsylvania carriers to those of other states by unlawful means;\r\nand to extort from railroad companies unreasonable rebates and\r\ncommissions, and by fraudulent means and devices to control the market\r\nprices of crude and refined petroleum and acquire unlawful gains\r\nthereby.[78]\r\n\r\nFour of the persons mentioned in the indictment—Messrs. O’Day, Warden,\r\nLockhart and Vandergrift—all citizens of Pennsylvania, gave bail, and\r\nearly in June application was made to Governor Hoyt of Pennsylvania to\r\nissue a requisition before the Governor of New York for the extradition\r\nof the other five gentlemen.\r\n\r\nWith damaging testimony piling up day by day in three states, and with\r\nan indictment for conspiracy hanging over the heads of himself and eight\r\nof his associates, matters looked gloomy for John D. Rockefeller in the\r\nspring of 1879. “The good of the oil business” certainly seemed in\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER EIGHT\r\n                         THE COMPROMISE OF 1880\r\n\r\n  THE PRODUCERS’ SUIT AGAINST ROCKEFELLER AND HIS ASSOCIATES USED BY THE\r\n    STANDARD TO PROTECT ITSELF—SUITS AGAINST THE TRANSPORTATION\r\n    COMPANIES ARE DELAYED—TRIAL OF ROCKEFELLER AND HIS ASSOCIATES FOR\r\n    CONSPIRACY POSTPONED—ALL OF THE SUITS WITHDRAWN IN RETURN FOR\r\n    AGREEMENTS OF THE STANDARD AND THE PENNSYLVANIA TO CEASE THEIR\r\n    PRACTICES AGAINST THE PRODUCERS—WITH THIS COMPROMISE THE SECOND\r\n    PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION COMES TO AN END—PRODUCERS THEMSELVES TO\r\n    BLAME FOR NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR LEADERS—STANDARD AGAIN ENFORCES\r\n    ORDERS OBJECTIONABLE TO PRODUCERS—MORE OUTBREAKS IN THE OIL\r\n    REGIONS—ROCKEFELLER HAVING SILENCED ORGANISED OPPOSITION PROCEEDS TO\r\n    SILENCE INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt the indictment of Mr. Rockefeller in the spring of 1879 seemed\r\nto him the work of malice and spite. By seven years of persistent effort\r\nhe had worked out a well-conceived plan for controlling the oil business\r\nof the United States. Another year and he had reason to believe that the\r\nremnant of refiners who still rebelled against his intentions would\r\neither be convinced or dead and he could rule unimpeded. But here at the\r\nvery threshold of empire a certain group of people—“people with a\r\nprivate grievance,” “mossbacks naturally left in the lurch by the\r\nprogress of this rapidly developing trade,” his colleagues described\r\nthem to the Hepburn Commission—stood in his way. “You have taken\r\ndeliberate advantage of the iniquitous practices of the railroads to\r\nbuild up a monopoly,” they told him. “We combined to overthrow those\r\npractices so far as the oil business was concerned. You not only refused\r\nto support us in this contention, you persuaded or forced the railroads\r\nto make you the only recipient of their illegal favours; more than that,\r\nyou developed the unjust practices, forcing them into forms unheard of\r\nbefore. Not only have you secured rebates of extraordinary value on all\r\nyour own shipments, you have persuaded the railroads to give you a\r\ncommission on the oil that other people ship. You are guilty of plotting\r\nagainst the prosperity of an industry.” And they indicted him with eight\r\nof his colleagues for conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which the oil men based this serious charge has already\r\nbeen analysed. At the moment they brought their suit for conspiracy what\r\nwas their situation? They had several months before driven the\r\ncommonwealth of Pennsylvania to bring suits against four railroads\r\noperating within its borders and against the Standard pipe-lines for\r\ninfringing their duties as common carriers. Partial testimony had been\r\ntaken in the case against the Pennsylvania road and in that against the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines. These suits, though far from finished, had given the\r\nProducers’ Union the bulk of the proof on which they had secured the\r\nindictment of the Standard officials for conspiracy. Now, since the\r\nrailroads and the pipe-lines were the guilty ones—that is, as it was\r\nthey who had granted the illegal favours, and as they were the only ones\r\nthat could surely be convicted, it seems clear that the only wise course\r\nfor the producers would have been to prosecute energetically and\r\nexclusively these first suits. But evident as the necessity for such\r\npersistency was, and just after Mr. Cassatt had startled the public and\r\ngiven the Union material with which it certainly in time could have\r\ncompelled the commonwealth to a complete investigation, the producers\r\ninterrupted their work by bringing their spectacular suit for\r\nconspiracy—a suit which perhaps might have been properly instituted\r\nafter the others had been completed, but which, introduced now,\r\ncompletely changed the situation, for it gave the witnesses from whom\r\nthey were most anxious to hear a loophole for escape.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the officials of the Standard pipe-lines had been\r\ninstructed to appear on the 14th of May, 1879, to answer questions which\r\nearlier in the trial they had refused to answer “on advice of counsel.”\r\nNow the president of the United Pipe Lines, J. J. Vandergrift, and the\r\ngeneral manager, Daniel O’Day, were both included in the indictment for\r\nconspiracy. The evening before the interrogatory the producers’ counsel\r\nreceived a telegram from the attorney-general of the state, announcing\r\nthat the pipe-line people were complaining that the testimony which they\r\nwould be called on to give on the morrow would be used against them in\r\nthe conspiracy trial—as it undoubtedly would have been—and that he\r\nthought it only fair that their hearing be postponed until after that\r\nsuit. And so the defendants gained time—the chief desideratum of\r\ndefendants who do not wish to fight.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the conspiracy case was again used to excellent advantage by\r\nthe Standard people in the investigation which was being conducted in\r\nNew York before the Hepburn Commission. Mr. Bostwick, the Standard Oil\r\nbuyer, whose order to buy immediate shipment oil only at a discount had\r\nbeen one of the oil men’s chief grievances for a year and a half, was\r\nsummoned as a witness; but Mr. Bostwick too was under indictment for\r\nconspiracy, and when the examiners began to put questions to him which\r\nthe producers were eager to have answered, he asked: “How can I, a man\r\nsoon to be tried for conspiracy, be expected to answer these questions?\r\nI shall incriminate myself.” He was sustained in his plea, and about all\r\nthe Hepburn Commission got out of him was, “I refuse to answer, lest I\r\nincriminate myself.” This, then, was the first fruit of the producers’\r\nhasty and vindictive suit. It had shut the mouths of the important\r\nStandard witnesses.\r\n\r\nDiscouraging as this discovery was, however, there was no reason why the\r\nsuits against the railroads should not have been pushed through, and the\r\ntestimony the officials unquestionably could be made to give, now that\r\nMr. Cassatt had set the pace, have been obtained. But the Producers’\r\nUnion had lost sight for the moment of the fact that the fundamental\r\ndifficulty in the trouble was the illegal discrimination of the common\r\ncarriers. The Union was so much more eager to punish Mr. Rockefeller\r\nthan it was to punish the railroads, that in bringing the suit for\r\nconspiracy it was even guilty of leniency toward the officials of the\r\nPennsylvania. Certainly, if there was to be an indictment for\r\nconspiracy, all the supposed conspirators should have been included. It\r\nwas by discriminations clearly contrary to the constitution of the state\r\nthat the Pennsylvania Railroad had made it possible for Mr. Rockefeller\r\nto achieve his monopoly in Pennsylvania. The Union had proof of these\r\nrebates, but they let off Mr. Scott and Mr. Cassatt because “they\r\nprofessed the greatest desire to get rid of Standard domination, and\r\nwere loudly asserting that they had been victimised and compelled at\r\ntimes to carry oil freights at less than cost.”[79] Evidently the fate\r\nof the settlement the oil men had made seven years before with Mr. Scott\r\nand the presidents of the other oil-bearing roads had been forgotten.\r\nNaturally enough the railroads took advantage of these signs of leniency\r\non the part of the producers, and brought all their enormous influence\r\nto bear on the state authorities to delay hearings and bring about a\r\nsettlement. The Pennsylvania secured delays up to December, 1879, and\r\nthen the Governor ordered the attorney-general to stop proceedings\r\nagainst the road until the testimony had been taken in the other four\r\ncases; that is, in the cases against (1) the United Pipe Lines; (2) the\r\nLake Shore and Michigan Southern; (3) the Dunkirk, Allegheny and\r\nPittsburg, and (4) the Atlantic and Great Western. It was a heavy blow\r\nto the Union, for at the moment its hands were tied by the conspiracy\r\ncase, as far as the United Pipe Lines were concerned, and the three\r\nrailroads were foreign corporations, only having branches in\r\nPennsylvania, and accordingly very difficult to reach. The testimony\r\ncould have been obtained, however, if the Union had been undivided in\r\nits interests. It would have been done, of course, if the state\r\nauthorities had been willing to do what was their obvious duty. But the\r\nstate authorities really asked nothing better than to escape further\r\nprosecution of the railroads. The administration was Republican, the\r\nGovernor being Henry M. Hoyt. Mr. Hoyt had been elected in the fall of\r\n1878 and so had inherited the suits from Governor Hartranft. He was\r\npledged, however, to see them through, for before the election the\r\nProducers’ Union had sent him the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        “TITUSVILLE, October 23, 1878.\r\n\r\n  “HENRY M. HOYT:\r\n\r\n  _Sir_—During the past few months, the Association of Producers of\r\n  Petroleum, long oppressed in their immediate business and kindred\r\n  industries by the persistent disregard of law by certain great\r\n  corporations exercising their powers within the state of\r\n  Pennsylvania, and daily subjected to incalculable loss by a powerful\r\n  and corrupt combination of these corporations and individuals, have\r\n  appealed to the executive, legislative and judiciary branches of the\r\n  government for relief and protection.\r\n\r\n  The questions which they raise for the consideration of the\r\n  authorities and the people affect not only themselves but the whole\r\n  public, not only the particular calling in which they are engaged,\r\n  but nearly all kinds of business in the commonwealth and the nation.\r\n\r\n  The Legislature has not responded to the demands made that the\r\n  provisions of the constitution shall be speedily enforced by\r\n  appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n  The present executive has caused proceedings to be instituted in the\r\n  courts looking to relief, if it can be had by process of law, and\r\n  these are still pending, while others may be begun.\r\n\r\n  In view of the grave duties which will devolve upon you, should you\r\n  be chosen to the high office to which you aspire, on behalf of the\r\n  Petroleum Producers’ Association I ask from you a definite\r\n  expression of your views upon the following subjects:\r\n\r\n  First—Will you, if elected, recommend to the Legislature the passage\r\n  of laws to carry into effect the third and twelfth sections of the\r\n  sixteenth, and the third, seventh and twelfth sections of the\r\n  seventeenth articles of the constitution of Pennsylvania?\r\n\r\n  Second—If such laws should be passed as referred to in the preceding\r\n  question, will you, as Governor, approve them, if constitutional?\r\n\r\n  Third—Will you, as Governor, recommend and approve such other\r\n  remedial legislation as may be required to cure the evils set forth\r\n  in a memorial to Governor Hartranft of August 15, 1878?\r\n\r\n  Fourth—In the selection of the law officer of the state, will you,\r\n  if elected, secure the services of one who will prosecute with\r\n  vigour all proceedings already commenced or that may be instituted,\r\n  having in view the subjection of corporations to the laws of the\r\n  land?\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully,\r\n                                                    A. N. PERRIN,\r\n                                                _Chairman Committee_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Hoyt’s answers were eminently satisfactory:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There were provisions in the constitution,” he wrote, “intended to\r\n  compel the railroads and canal companies of the state to the\r\n  performance of their duties as common carriers with fairness and\r\n  equality, without discrimination, to all persons doing business over\r\n  their lines. This policy is just and right.\r\n\r\n  “If called to a position requiring official action, I would\r\n  recommend and approve any legislation necessary and appropriate to\r\n  carry into effect the sections of the constitution referred to.\r\n\r\n  “It would be my duty, if elected, to see that no citizen, or class\r\n  of citizens even, were subjected to hardship or injustice in their\r\n  business, by illegal acts of corporations or others, where relief\r\n  lay within executive control. Any proper measures or legislation\r\n  which would effectually remedy the grievances set forth in the\r\n  memorial addressed to Governor Hartranft would receive my\r\n  recommendation and approval.\r\n\r\n  “It would be my duty, if elected, to select only such officers as\r\n  would enforce obedience to the constitution and laws, both by\r\n  corporations and individuals, without fear or favour, and all such\r\n  officers would be held by me to strict accountability for the full\r\n  and prompt discharge of all their official duties.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Hoyt had indeed begun the suits, all of the testimony in regard\r\nto the Pennsylvania having been taken in his administration. This\r\ntestimony must have proved to him that the transgressions of the road\r\nhad been far more flagrant than anyone dreamed of—that they had amounted\r\nsimply to driving certain men out of business in order to build up the\r\nbusiness of certain other men. His evident duty, as his letter to the\r\nproducers shows clearly enough that he realised, was to push the suits\r\nagainst the railroads even if the oil men entirely withdrew, but instead\r\nof that it became evident in the spring that he was using every\r\nopportunity to delay. Indeed, one reason the producers gave for bringing\r\nthe conspiracy suit was that it would give the state authorities a\r\nscapegoat; that they would gladly act vigorously against the Standard if\r\nthey were let off from prosecuting the Pennsylvania. Governor Hoyt now\r\navailed himself fully of the vacillation of the Union toward the\r\nrailroads, using it as an excuse for not prosecuting the railroad cases.\r\n\r\nBut if the producers were half-hearted toward the railroads they were\r\nwhole-hearted enough toward the Standard. In spite of the fact that they\r\nhad gotten in their own way, so to speak, by bringing their conspiracy\r\nsuit, they felt convinced that they had material enough to win it on,\r\nand they sought the extradition of the non-residents who had been\r\nindicted.\r\n\r\nEarly in June Governor Hoyt was called upon to issue a requisition for\r\nthe extradition of John D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, H. M.\r\nFlagler, J. A. Bostwick, Daniel O’Day, Charles Pratt and G. W. Girty. A\r\nfull agreement was made before the state officials, but a decision was\r\ndeferred repeatedly. Finally, worn out with waiting, Mr. Campbell, in a\r\ntelegram to the Governor on July 29, threatened, if there was longer\r\ndelay, to make his request for extradition through the public press. The\r\nanswer from Harrisburg was that the attorney-general was sick and could\r\nnot attend to the matter. Mr. Campbell wired back that he was tired of\r\n“addition, division, and silence,” and he sent out the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            “FAIRFIELD, July 31, 1879.\r\n\r\n  “TO HIS EXCELLENCY HENRY M. HOYT,\r\n      Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Sir_—On behalf of the producers of oil, whom I represent as\r\n  president of their General Council, I most respectfully ask a\r\n  decision at your hands, of the requisition on the Governor of the\r\n  state of New York, for the surrender of the officers of the Standard\r\n  Oil Company, indicted by the Grand Jury of Clarion County, and now\r\n  believed to be within the limits of the state of New York.\r\n\r\n  The case was exhaustively argued before you, more than four weeks\r\n  ago, and the great oil interest which I have the honour to represent\r\n  has a right to a prompt decision on this vital question. If these\r\n  parties—who for their own profit and its ruin control Pennsylvania’s\r\n  most valuable product, and compel its greatest carrier to undertake\r\n  their warfare and to do their bidding at the sacrifice of its\r\n  innocent stockholders—can, under the plea of being ‘aliens,’ defy\r\n  the law of Pennsylvania and laugh at our impotent attempts to reach\r\n  them, the sooner it is known the better. It is possible that if we\r\n  are denied protection within the limits of our commonwealth, we may\r\n  obtain justice by appealing to the courts of a sister state, where\r\n  at least the defendants will be obliged to admit that they are\r\n  residents.\r\n\r\n           Your obedient servant,\r\n                                         B. B. CAMPBELL,\r\n                                   _President of Producers’ Council_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor remained obdurate, nor was the request ever granted. In a\r\nmessage sent out in January, 1881, Governor Hoyt gave a review of the\r\ncase—as he was compelled to do, so great was the popular criticism of\r\nhis course in not pushing the suits and in refusing the request for\r\nextradition—in which he attributed his refusal to the negotiations begun\r\nbetween the railroads and the Producers’ Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The details of these negotiations, of course, need not, and did\r\n  not, reach the office of the executive department,” he said. “As a\r\n  part of them, however, requests were presented in the interest of\r\n  the petitioners (the Producers’ Union) to the Governor, not to issue\r\n  the requisition, followed again by requests that they be allowed to\r\n  go out. Finding that the highest process of the commonwealth was\r\n  being used simply as leverage for and against the parties to these\r\n  negotiations between contending litigants, and that, however entire\r\n  and perfect might have been the good faith in which the criminal\r\n  proceedings in Clarion County had been commenced, they were being\r\n  regarded and treated as a mere make-weight in the stages of private\r\n  diplomacy, I deemed it my duty, in the exercise of a sound\r\n  discretion, to suspend action on the requisitions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  E.

When August came the Standard sought a continuance, and it\r\nwas granted. The delay did not in any way discourage the producers, and\r\nwhen Mr. Rockefeller became convinced of this he tried conciliation.\r\n“Come, let us reason together,” has always been a favourite proposition\r\nof Mr. Rockefeller. He would rather persuade than coerce, rather silence\r\nthan fight. He had been making peace overtures ever since the suits\r\nbegan. The first had been in the fall of 1878, soon after they were\r\ninstituted, when he sent the following letter to Captain Vandergrift:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “CAPTAIN J. J. VANDERGRIFT:\r\n\r\n  _My dear Sir_—We are now prepared to enter into a contract to refine\r\n  all the petroleum that can be sold in the markets of the world at a\r\n  low price for refining. Prices of refined oil to be made by a joint\r\n  committee of producers and refiners, and the profits to be\r\n  determined by these; profits to be divided equitably between both\r\n  parties. This joint interest to have the lowest net rates obtainable\r\n  from railroads. If your judgment approves, you may consult some of\r\n  the producers upon this question. This would probably require the\r\n  United Pipe Lines to make contracts and act as a clearing house for\r\n  both parties.\r\n\r\n                       Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                                   J. D. ROCKEFELLER.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Vandergrift handed the letter to the executive committee of the\r\nProducers’ Union. It was returned to him without a reply. The producers\r\nhad tried an arrangement of this kind with Mr. Rockefeller’s National\r\nRefiners’ Association in the winter of 1872 and 1873, and it had failed.\r\nThe refiners had thrown up their contract when they found they could get\r\nall the oil they wanted at a lower price than they had contracted to pay\r\nthe Producers’ Union, from men who had not gone into that organisation.\r\nThe oil country was familiar, too, with the case of the H. L. Taylor\r\nCompany, whose complaint against the Standard was referred to in the\r\nlast chapter. Contracts of that sort were never meant to be kept, they\r\ndeclared. They were meant as “sops, opiates.” In November, 1878, after\r\nthe testimony which had been brought out by the suit against the United\r\nPipe Lines had been pretty well aired in the New York Sun and other\r\npapers, and one or two private suits against the railroads were creating\r\na good deal of public discussion, an effort to secure a conference\r\nbetween the representatives of the Union and the Standard officials was\r\nmade. The Union refused to go into it officially. A meeting was held,\r\nhowever, in New York on November 29, at which several well-known oil men\r\nwere present. It was announced to the press in advance that it was to be\r\nan important but secret meeting between the oil producers, refiners and\r\nStandard men; that its object was to settle all grievances, and to\r\nsecure a withdrawal of the impending suits. As soon as the news of this\r\nproposed meeting reached the Oil Regions, the officials of the Union\r\npromptly denied their connection with it.\r\n\r\nAlthough these early efforts to get a wedge into the Producers’ Union\r\nand thus secure a staying of the suits had no results, the Standard was\r\nnot discouraged—it never is: there is no evidence in its history that it\r\nknows what the word means. Not being able to handle the Union as a\r\nwhole, the Standard began working on individuals. By March, 1879, the\r\nidea of a compromise had become particularly strong in Oil City. Indeed,\r\none of the several reasons advanced for bringing the conspiracy suits\r\nwas that such a proceeding would defeat the efforts the Oil City branch\r\nwere making to bring about a settlement with Mr. Rockefeller.\r\nAccordingly, when it became apparent to Mr. Rockefeller in the fall of\r\n1879 that the producers meant to fight through the conspiracy suit,\r\nthough they might dally over the others, he notified Roger Sherman,\r\ncounsel for the Union, that he wished to lay before him a proposition\r\nlooking to a settlement. The president, Mr. Campbell, was in favour of\r\nreceiving the proposition. “I have no idea they will present anything we\r\ncan accept,” he wrote Mr. Sherman. “Still it will furnish a first-rate\r\ngauge to test how badly they are scared.” And the Standard was told that\r\nthe Union would consider what they had to offer. “But it is a serious\r\nquestion—this of settlement,” replied Mr. Rockefeller. “Our trial is set\r\nfor October 28. We cannot get ready for that and prepare a proposition\r\ntoo. Why not postpone the trial?” This was done—December 15 being set.\r\nBut no proposition was made to the producers for over six weeks—then\r\nthey were asked to meet the Standard men on November 29 in New York\r\nCity. Piqued at the delay, the producers informed the Standard that they\r\ncould no longer consider their proposition and that the trial would be\r\npushed.\r\n\r\nBut again the Standard secured delay—this time by petitioning that the\r\ncase be argued before the Supreme Court of the state. They declared that\r\nsuch was the state of public feeling in Clarion County that they could\r\nnot obtain justice there. They charged the judges with bias and\r\nprejudice, declared secret societies were working against them, and\r\ncalled attention to the civil suits which were still hanging fire. Over\r\nthis petition serious trouble arose in court—there was a wrangle between\r\nthe judge and the Standard’s counsel. The newspapers took it up—the\r\nwhole state divided itself into camps, and the case was again postponed,\r\nthis time until the first of the year. Postponement obtained, compromise\r\nwas again proposed upon the basis of abandonment of all those methods of\r\ndoing business which the producers claimed injured them, and as a mark\r\nof their sincerity the United Pipe Lines on December 24, 1879, issued an\r\norder announcing the abandonment of immediate shipment throughout the\r\nregion. A meeting between the legal advisers of the two parties to\r\ndiscuss the proposed terms was arranged for January 7, 1880, at the\r\nFifth Avenue Hotel in New York City—the very time to which the trial of\r\nthe case for conspiracy had been postponed. It was hardly to be expected\r\nthat when such negotiations were going on in New York the trial in\r\nClarion County would be pushed very briskly. It was not. There was a\r\nhitch again, and for the fourth time proceedings were stayed. The\r\nconferences, however, went on.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations with the Standard continued for a month, and then,\r\nearly in February, Mr. Campbell, the president of the Union, called a\r\nmeeting of the Grand Council for February 19, 1880, in Titusville,\r\nPennsylvania. For several weeks the Oil Regions had known that President\r\nCampbell and Roger Sherman, the leading lawyer of the Union, were in\r\nconference with the Standard officials. It was rumoured that they were\r\narranging a compromise, and it was suspected that the meeting now called\r\nwas to consider the terms. Naturally the proposition to be made was\r\nlooked for with suspicion and curiosity. The meeting was the largest the\r\nGrand Council had held for many months. It was supposed to be secret,\r\nlike all gatherings of the Union, but before the first session was over,\r\nthe word spread over the Oil Regions that Mr. Campbell had brought to\r\nthe meeting contracts with both Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Scott, and that\r\nthey were receiving harsh criticism from the Grand Council. The very\r\nmeagre accounts which exist of this gathering, historic in oil annals,\r\nshow that it was one of the most exciting which was ever held in the\r\ncountry, and one can well believe this when one considers the bitter\r\npill the council was asked to swallow that day. Mr. Campbell began the\r\nsession by reporting that all the suits at which they had been labouring\r\nfor nearly two years had been withdrawn, and that in return for their\r\nwithdrawal the Standard and the Pennsylvania Railroad officials had\r\nsigned contracts to cease certain of the practices of which the\r\nproducers complained.\r\n\r\nThe Standard contract, which Mr. Campbell then presented, pledged Mr.\r\nRockefeller, and some sixteen associates, whose names were attached to\r\nthe document, to the following policy:\r\n\r\n1. They would hereafter make no opposition to an entire abrogation of\r\nthe system of rebates, drawbacks and secret rates of freight in the\r\ntransportation of petroleum on the railroads.\r\n\r\n2. They withdrew their opposition to secrecy in rate making—that is,\r\nthey promised that they would not hereafter receive any rebate or\r\ndrawback that the railroad company was not at liberty to make known and\r\nto give to other shippers of petroleum.\r\n\r\n3. They abandoned entirely the policy which they had been pursuing in\r\nthe management of the United Pipe Lines—that is, they promised that\r\nthere should be no discrimination whatever hereafter between their\r\npatrons; that the rates should be reasonable and not advanced except on\r\nthirty days’ notice; that they would make no difference between the\r\nprice of crude in different districts excepting such as might be\r\nproperly based upon the difference in the quality of the oil; that they\r\nwould receive, transport, store and deliver all oil tendered to them, up\r\nto a production of 65,000 barrels a day. And if the production should\r\nexceed that amount they agreed that they would not purchase any\r\nso-called “immediate shipment” oil at a discount on the price of\r\ncertificate oil.\r\n\r\n4. They promised hereafter that when certificates had been given for oil\r\ntaken into the custody of the pipe-lines, the transfer of these\r\ncertificates should be considered as a delivery of the oil, and the\r\ntankage of the seller would be treated as free.[80]\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller also agreed in making this contract to pay the\r\nProducers’ Union $40,000 to cover the expense of their litigation. In\r\nreturn for this money and for the abandonment of secret rebates and of\r\nthe pipe-line policy to which he had held so strenuously, what was he to\r\nreceive? He was not to be tried for conspiracy. And that day, after the\r\ncontract had been presented to the Grand Council, Mr. Campbell sent the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       “TITUSVILLE, February 19, 1880.\r\n\r\n  “TO HIS EXCELLENCY HENRY M. HOYT,\r\n      Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Sir_—As prosecutor in the case of the Commonwealth _vs._ J. D.\r\n  Rockefeller, Number 25, April Sessions of Clarion County, I consent\r\n  to the withdrawal of the requisition asked of you for extradition of\r\n  J. D. Rockefeller _et al._, the same having been in your hands\r\n  undecided since July last and a _nolle prosequi_ having been entered\r\n  by leave of Court of Clarion County in the case, and I will request\r\n  William L. Hindman, the prosecuting attorney, to forward a formal\r\n  withdrawal.\r\n\r\n                                        Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                      B. B. CAMPBELL.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contract with the Pennsylvania which was signed by Mr. Scott agreed,\r\nin consideration of the withdrawal of the suit against the road, to the\r\nfollowing policy:\r\n\r\n1. That it would make known to all shippers all rates of freight charged\r\nupon petroleum. [This was an abolition of secret rates.]\r\n\r\n2. If any rates of freight were allowed one shipper as against another,\r\non demand that rate was to be made known.\r\n\r\n3. There should be no longer any discrimination in the allotment and\r\ndistribution of cars to shippers of petroleum.\r\n\r\n4. Any rebate allowed to a large shipper was to be reasonable.[81]\r\n\r\nThere were both humiliation and bitterness in the Council when the\r\nreport was read—humiliation and bitterness that after two years of such\r\nstrenuous fighting all that was achieved was a contract which sacrificed\r\nwhat everybody knew to be the fundamental principle, the principle which\r\nup to this point the producers had always insisted must be recognised in\r\nany negotiation—that the rebate system was wrong and must not be\r\ncompromised with. Hard speeches were made, and Mr. Campbell’s head was\r\nbowed more than once while big tears ran down his cheeks. He had worked\r\nlong and hard. Probably most of the members of the Grand Council who\r\nwere present had a consciousness that no one of them had done anywhere\r\nnear what Mr. Campbell had done toward prosecuting their cause, and\r\nthough they might object to the compromise, they could not blame him,\r\nknowing all the difficulties which had been put in the way. So they\r\naccepted the report, thanking him for his fidelity and energy, but not\r\nfailing to express their disapproval of the reservation in regard to the\r\nrebate system. They ended their meeting by a resolution bitterly\r\ncondemning the courts, the state administration at Harrisburg, and\r\ncorporations in general:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “We declare that by the inefficiency and weakness of the secretary\r\n  of internal affairs in the year 1878; by the interposition on more\r\n  than one occasion of the attorney-general in 1879, by which the\r\n  taking of testimony was prevented; by the failure of the present\r\n  government for many months, either to grant or deny the requisition\r\n  for criminals indicted for crime, within the commonwealth of\r\n  Pennsylvania, fugitives to other states; and by the interference of\r\n  some of the judges of the Supreme Court, by an extraordinary and,\r\n  according to the best legal judgment of the land, unlawful\r\n  proceeding, by which the trial of an indictment for misdemeanour\r\n  pending in a local court was delayed and prevented, the alarming and\r\n  most dangerous influence of powerful corporations has been\r\n  demonstrated. While we accept the inevitable result forced upon us\r\n  by these influences, we aver that the contest is not over and our\r\n  objects not attained, but we all continue to advocate and maintain\r\n  the subordination of all corporations to the laws, the constitution,\r\n  and the will of the people, however and whenever expressed; that the\r\n  system of freight discrimination by common carriers is absolutely\r\n  wrong in principle, and tends to the fostering of dangerous\r\n  monopolies; and that it is the duty of the government, by\r\n  legislation and executive action, to protect the people from their\r\n  growing and dangerous power.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd with this resolution the second Petroleum Producers’ Union formed to\r\nfight Mr. Rockefeller came to an end.\r\n\r\nBy the morning of February 20 the Oil Regions knew of the compromise.\r\nThe news was received in sullen anger. It was due to the cowardice of\r\nthe state officials, the corrupting influence of corporations, the oil\r\nmen said. They blamed everybody but themselves, and yet if they had done\r\ntheir duty the suits would never have been compromised. The simple fact\r\nis that the mass of oil men had not stood by their leaders in the hard\r\nfight they had been making. These leaders, Mr. Campbell the president,\r\nMr. Sherman the chief counsel, and Mr. Patterson the head of the\r\nlegislative committee, had given almost their entire time for two years\r\nto the work of the Union. The offices of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Patterson\r\nwere both honorary, and they had both often used their private funds in\r\nprosecuting their work. Mr. Sherman gave his services for months at a\r\ntime without pay. No one outside of the Council of the Union knew the\r\nstress that came upon these three men. Up to the decision to institute\r\nthe conspiracy suit they had worked in harmony. But when that was\r\ndecided upon Mr. Patterson withdrew. He saw how fatal such a move must\r\nbe, how completely it interfered with the real work of the Union,\r\nforcing common carriers to do their duty. He saw that the substantial\r\nsteps gained were given up and that the work would all have to be done\r\nover again if their suit went on. Mr. Campbell believed in it, however,\r\nand Mr. Sherman, whether he believed in it or not, saw no way but to\r\nfollow his chief. The nine months of disappointment and disillusion\r\nwhich followed were terrible for both men. They soon saw that the forces\r\nagainst them were too strong, that they would never in all probability\r\nbe able to get the conspiracy suit tried, and that so long as it was on\r\nthe docket the proper witnesses could not be secured for the suits\r\nagainst the railroads. Finally it came to be a question with them what\r\nout of the wreck of their plans and hopes could they save? And they\r\nsaved what the compromise granted. If the oil producers they\r\nrepresented, a body of some 2,000 men, had stood behind them throughout\r\n1879 as they did in 1878 the results would have been different. Their\r\npower, their means, were derived from this body, and this body for many\r\nmonths had been giving them feeble support. Scattered as they were over\r\na great stretch of country, interested in nothing but their own oil\r\nfarms, the producers could only be brought into an alliance by hope of\r\noverturning disastrous business conditions. They all felt that the\r\nmonopoly the Standard had achieved was a menace to their interests, and\r\nthey went willingly into the Union at the start, and supported it\r\ngenerously, but they were an impatient people, demanding quick results,\r\nand when they saw that the relief the Union promised could only come\r\nthrough lawsuits and legislation which it would take perhaps years to\r\nfinish, they lost interest and refused money. At the first meeting of\r\nthe Grand Council of the Union in November, 1878, there were nearly 200\r\ndelegates present—at the last one in February, 1880, scarcely forty.\r\nMany of the local lodges were entirely dead. Not even the revival in the\r\nsummer of 1879 of the hated immediate shipment order, which had caused\r\nso much excitement the year before, but which had not been enforced long\r\nbecause of the uprising, brought them back to the Union. In July the\r\norder had been put in operation again in a fashion most offensive to the\r\noil men, it being announced by the United Pipe Lines that thereafter oil\r\nwould be bought by a system of sealed bids. Blanks were to be furnished\r\nthe producers, the formula of which ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BRADFORD, PENNSYLVANIA,........ 187..\r\n\r\n  I hereby offer to sell J. A. Bostwick .... barrels crude oil, of\r\n  forty-two gallons per barrel, at .... cents, at the wells, for\r\n  shipment from the United Pipe Lines, within the next five (5) days,\r\n  provided that any portion of the oil not delivered to you within the\r\n  specified time shall be considered cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a frightful uproar in consequence. The morning after this\r\nannouncement several hundred men gathered in front of the United Pipe\r\nLine’s office in Bradford, and held an open-air meeting. They had a band\r\non the ground which played “Hold the Fort”; and the following\r\nresolutions were adopted:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Resolved, That the oil producers of the Northern District in\r\n  meeting assembled do maintain and declare that the present shipment\r\n  order is infamous in principle and disreputable in practice, and we\r\n  hereby declare that we will not sell one barrel of oil in conformity\r\n  with the requirements of the said order. And we pledge our lives,\r\n  our fortunes and our sacred honour to resort to every legal means,\r\n  to use every influence in our power to prevent any sales under the\r\n  said order. And we also declare that the United Pipe Lines shall\r\n  hereafter perform their duty as common carriers under the law.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night a battalion of some 300 masked men in robes of white marched\r\nthrough the streets of Bradford, groaning those that they suspected of\r\nbeing in sympathy with the Standard methods, and cheering their friends.\r\nAgain there appeared there, that night, all over the upper oil country,\r\ncabalistic signs, which had been seen there often the year before. The\r\nfeeling was so intense, and the danger of riot so great, that\r\ntwenty-four hours after the order for sealed bids was given, it was\r\nwithdrawn. The outbreak aroused Mr. Campbell’s hope that it might be\r\npossible at this moment to arouse the lodges, and he wrote a prominent\r\noil man of Bradford asking his opinion. In reply he received the\r\nfollowing letter. It shows very well what the leaders had to contend\r\nagainst. It shows, too, the point of view of a very frank and\r\nintelligent oil producer:\r\n\r\n\r\n                               “BRADFORD, PENNSYLVANIA, July 30, 1879.\r\n\r\n  “B. B. CAMPBELL,\r\n      Parnassus, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_—Your despatch of yesterday from O. C. has only just\r\n  reached me. As I cannot say what I want to over the wires I reply by\r\n  mail.\r\n\r\n  You ask if the high-sounding wording of the declaration of rights of\r\n  the producers made at their mass-meeting, held here on Monday, in\r\n  which they pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honours, means\r\n  liberal subscriptions to the Council funds. I reply with sorrow and\r\n  humiliation—_I fear not_. All this high-flown talk is buncombe of\r\n  the worst kind. The producers are willing to meet in a mass-meeting\r\n  held out of doors where it costs nothing even for rent of a hall,\r\n  and pass any kind of a resolution that is offered. It costs nothing\r\n  to do this, but when asked to contribute a dollar to the legal\r\n  prosecution of these plunderers, robbers, and fugitives from\r\n  justice, whom they are denouncing in their resolution, they either\r\n  positively refuse, say that the Council is doing nothing, that the\r\n  suits are interminable and will never end, that there is no justice\r\n  to be obtained in the courts of Pennsylvania, etc., etc., or else\r\n  plead poverty and say they have contributed all that they are able\r\n  to.\r\n\r\n  True, the producers are poor and the suits and legal proceedings are\r\n  slow, and there is much to discourage them, but I tell you, my\r\n  honoured chief, that the true inwardness of this state of affairs\r\n  is, that the people of the Oil Regions have by slow degrees and easy\r\n  stages been brought into a condition of bondage and serfdom by the\r\n  monopoly, until now, when they have been aroused to a realisation of\r\n  their condition, they have not the courage and manhood left to\r\n  enable them to strike a blow for liberty. And these are the people\r\n  for whom you and your few faithful followers in the Council are\r\n  labouring, spending (I fear wasting) your substance—neglecting your\r\n  own interest to advance theirs, and all for what good—“_cui bono_”?\r\n\r\n  I fear you will say that I am discouraged. No, not discouraged, but\r\n  disgusted with the poor, spiritless, and faint-hearted people whom\r\n  you are labouring so hard to liberate from bondage. As to the\r\n  prospects of raising funds for the prosecution of the suits by\r\n  subscription or assessments on the Unions, I am sorry to say that I\r\n  fear it is impossible—at least it is impossible for me to make any\r\n  collections—and right here let me make a suggestion. I often feel\r\n  that the fault may not be with the people, but with the writer. I\r\n  would therefore suggest that you select from among the members of\r\n  the Council any good man whom you think has the power of convincing\r\n  these people that their only hope of relief lies in sustaining you\r\n  in the prosecution of the suits, and therefore they must contribute\r\n  to the fund. If you will do this, I will promise you that he will be\r\n  hospitably received and favourably introduced by the writer. But as\r\n  for depending on the unaided efforts of myself to raise funds, I\r\n  fear it would be useless.\r\n\r\n  I do not write this, my friend, with a view of throwing any\r\n  discouragement in your path, which, God knows, is rugged and thorny\r\n  enough, but I must give vent to my righteous indignation in some\r\n  way, and ask you are the producers as a class (nothing but a d—d\r\n  cowardly, disorganised mob as they are) worth the efforts you are\r\n  putting forth to save them?\r\n\r\n  As for myself, a single individual (and I can speak for no others),\r\n  I am determined to stand with you until the end, with my best\r\n  strength and my last dollar.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, what was this loose and easily discouraged organisation opposing? A\r\ncompact body of a few able, cold-blooded men—men to whom anything was\r\nright that they could get, men knowing exactly what they wanted, men who\r\nloved the game they played because of the reward at the goal, and, above\r\nall, men who knew how to hold their tongues and wait. “To Mr.\r\nRockefeller,” they say in the Oil Regions, “a day is as a year and a\r\nyear as a day. He can wait, but he never gives up.” Mr. Rockefeller knew\r\nthe producers, knew how feeble their staying qualities in anything but\r\nthe putting down of oil wells, and he may have said confidently, at the\r\nbeginning of their suits against him, as it was reported he did say,\r\nthat they would never be finished. They had not been finished from any\r\nlack of material. If the suits had been pushed but one result was\r\npossible, and that was the conviction of both the Standard and the\r\nrailroads; they had been left unfinished because of the impatience and\r\ninstability of the prosecuting body and the compactness, resolution and\r\nwatchfulness of the defendants.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of the suits was a great victory for Mr. Rockefeller.\r\nThere was no longer any doubt of his power in defensive operations.\r\nHaving won a victory, he quickly went to work to make it secure. The\r\nUnion had surrendered, but the men who had made the Union remained; the\r\nevidence against him was piled up in indestructible records. In time the\r\nsame elements which had united to form the serious opposition just\r\noverthrown might come together, and if they should it was possible that\r\nthey would not a second time make the mistake of vacillation. The press\r\nof the Oil Regions was largely independent. It had lost, to be sure, the\r\naudacity, the wit, the irrepressible spirit of eight years before when\r\nit fought the South Improvement Company. Its discretion had outstripped\r\nits courage, but there were still signs of intelligent independence in\r\nthe newspapers. Mr. Rockefeller now entered on a campaign of\r\nreconciliation which aimed to placate, or silence, every opposing force.\r\n\r\nMany of the great human tragedies of the Oil Regions lie in the\r\nindividual compromises which followed the public settlement of 1880; for\r\nthen it was that man after man, from hopelessness, from disgust, from\r\nambition, from love of money, gave up the fight for principle which he\r\nhad waged for seven years. “The Union has surrendered,” they said; “why\r\nfight on?” This man took a position with the Standard and became\r\nhenceforth active in its business; that man took a salary and dropped\r\nout of sight; this one went his independent way, but with closed lips;\r\nthat one shook the dust of the Oil Regions from his feet and went out to\r\nseek “God’s country,” asking only that he should never again hear the\r\nword “oil.” The newspapers bowed to the victor. A sudden hush came over\r\nthe region, the hush of defeat, of cowardice, of hopelessness. Only the\r\n“poor producer” grumbled. “You can’t satisfy the producer,” Mr.\r\nRockefeller often has had occasion to remark benignantly and pitifully.\r\nThe producer alone was not “convinced.” He still rehearsed the series of\r\ndramatic attacks and sieges which had wiped out independent effort. He\r\ntaught his children that the cause had been sold, and he stigmatised the\r\nmen who had gone over to the Standard as traitors. Scores of boys and\r\ngirls grew up in the Oil Regions in those days with the same feeling of\r\nterrified curiosity toward those who had “sold to the Standard” that\r\nthey had toward those who had “been in jail.” The Oil Regions as a whole\r\nwas at heart as irreconcilable in 1880 as it had been after the South\r\nImprovement Company fight, and now it had added to its sense of outrage\r\nthe humiliation of defeat. Its only immediate hope now was in the\r\nsuccess of one of the transportation enterprises which had come into\r\nexistence with the uprising of 1878 and to which it had been for two\r\nyears giving what support it could. This enterprise was the seaboard\r\npipe-line which, as we have seen, Messrs. Benson, McKelvy and Hopkins\r\nhad undertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NUMBER 1 (See page 1007)\r\n                PROFESSOR SILLIMAN’S REPORT ON PETROLEUM\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From “The Early and Later History of Petroleum,” by J. T. Henry,\r\n  pages 38–54.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  MESSRS. EVELETH, BISSELL AND REED.\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_:—I herewith offer you the results of my somewhat\r\n  extended researches upon the rock-oil, or petroleum, from Venango\r\n  County, Pennsylvania, which you have requested me to examine with\r\n  reference to its value for economical purposes.\r\n\r\n  Numerous localities, well known in different parts of the world,\r\n  furnish an oily fluid exuding from the surface of the earth,\r\n  sometimes alone in “tar springs,” as they are called in the Western\r\n  United States; frequently it is found floating upon the surface of\r\n  water in a thin film, with rainbow colours, or in dark globules,\r\n  that may, by mechanical means, be separated from the fluid on which\r\n  it swims.\r\n\r\n  In some places wells are sunk for the purpose of accumulating the\r\n  product in a situation convenient for collection by pumping the\r\n  water out. The oil exudes on the shores of lakes and lagoons, or\r\n  rises from springs beneath the beds of rivers. Such are the springs\r\n  of Baku, in Persia, and the wells of Amiano, in the duchy of Parma,\r\n  in Italy. The usual geological position of the rocks furnishing this\r\n  natural product is in the coal measures—but it is by no means\r\n  confined to this group of rocks, since it has been found in deposits\r\n  much more recent, and also in those that are older—but in whatever\r\n  deposits it may occur, it is uniformly regarded as a product of\r\n  vegetable decomposition. Whether this decomposition has been\r\n  effected by fermentation only, or by the aid of an elevated\r\n  temperature, and distilled by heated vapour, is perhaps hardly\r\n  settled.\r\n\r\n  It is interesting, however, in this connection to remember that the\r\n  distillation, at an elevated temperature, of certain black,\r\n  bituminous shales in England and France has furnished large\r\n  quantities of an oil having many points of resemblance with naphtha,\r\n  the name given to this colourless oil, which is the usual product of\r\n  distilling petroleum. The very high boiling point of most of the\r\n  products of the distillation of the rockoil from Venango County,\r\n  Pennsylvania, would seem to indicate that it was a pyrogenic\r\n  (fire-produced) product.\r\n\r\n  Bitumen, asphaltum, mineral pitch, chapapote, etc., etc., are names\r\n  variously given to the more or less hard, black, resinous substance\r\n  which is produced usually from the exposure of petroleum to the air,\r\n  and is found either with or without the fluid naphtha or petroleum.\r\n  The most remarkable examples of the occurrence of these substances,\r\n  so intimately connected with the history of rock-oil, are the Lake\r\n  Asphaltites of the Dead Sea, so memorable in history, the well-known\r\n  Bitumen Lake of Trinidad, and the deposits of mineral pitch or\r\n  chapapote in Cuba. In one of the provinces of India, vast quantities\r\n  of petroleum are annually produced, the chief consumption being\r\n  local, for fuel and lights, but a portion is also exported to Europe\r\n  for the production of naphtha. In the United States, many points on\r\n  the Ohio and its tributaries are noted as producing this oil; nearly\r\n  all of them within the coal measures. A detailed history of these\r\n  various localities can be found recorded in books of science, and\r\n  their repetition here would be out of place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE CRUDE PRODUCT\r\n\r\n  The crude oil, as it is gathered on your lands, has a dark brown\r\n  colour, which, by reflected light, is greenish or bluish. It is\r\n  thick even in warm weather—about as thick as thin molasses. In very\r\n  cold weather it is somewhat more stiff, but can always be poured\r\n  from a bottle even at 15° below zero. Its odour is strong and\r\n  peculiar, and recalls to those who are familiar with it the smell of\r\n  bitumen and naphtha. Exposed for a long time to the air, it does not\r\n  thicken or form a skin on its surface, and in no sense can it be\r\n  called a drying oil. The density of the crude oil is .882, water\r\n  being 1.000. It boils only at a very high temperature, and yet it\r\n  begins to give off a vapour at a temperature not greatly above that\r\n  of boiling water. It takes fire with some difficulty and burns with\r\n  an abundant smoky flame. It stains paper with the appearance of\r\n  ordinary fat oils, and feels smooth and greasy between the fingers.\r\n  It is frequently used in its crude state to lubricate coarse\r\n  machinery. In chemical characters, it is entirely unlike the fat\r\n  oils. Most of these characters are common to petroleum from various\r\n  places. In one important respect, however, the product of your lands\r\n  differs from that obtained in other situations, that is, it does\r\n  not, by continued exposure to the air, become hard and resinous like\r\n  mineral pitch or bitumen. I have been informed by those who have\r\n  visited the locality, that on the surface of the earth above the\r\n  springs which furnish your oil there is no crust or deposit of this\r\n  sort such as I have seen in other situations where petroleum or\r\n  mineral tar is flowing. This difference will be seen to be of\r\n  considerable importance, as it is understood and represented that\r\n  this product exists in great abundance upon your property, that it\r\n  can be gathered wherever a well is sunk in the soil, over a great\r\n  number of acres, and that it is unfailing in its yield from year to\r\n  year. The question naturally arises, Of what value is it in the\r\n  arts, and for what uses can it be employed? These researches answer\r\n  these inquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EXAMINATION OF THE OIL\r\n\r\n  To determine what products might be obtained in the oil, a portion\r\n  of it was submitted to fractional distillation.[82] The temperature\r\n  of the fluid was constantly regulated by a thermometer, the heat\r\n  being applied first by a water bath, and then by a bath of linseed\r\n  oil. This experiment was founded upon the belief that the crude\r\n  product contained several distinct oils, having different boiling\r\n  points. The quantity of material used in this experiment was 304\r\n  grammes. The thermometer indicated the degrees of the Centigrade\r\n  scale, but, for convenience, the corresponding degrees of\r\n  Fahrenheit’s scale are added. The water bath failed to distil any\r\n  portion of the oil at 100° C. (= 212° F.), only a small quantity of\r\n  acid water came over. An oil bath, linseed oil, was then\r\n  substituted, and the temperature was regularly raised by slow\r\n  degrees until distillation commenced. From that point the heat was\r\n  successively raised by stages of ten degrees, allowing full time at\r\n  each stage for complete distillation of all that would rise at that\r\n  temperature before advancing to the next stage. The results of this\r\n  tedious process are given in the annexed table—304 grammes of crude\r\n  oil, submitted to fractional distillation, gave\r\n\r\n                         TEMPERATURE                    QUANTITY\r\n       1st Prod. at 100° C. =  213° F.(acid water)        5 gms.\r\n       2nd Prod. at 140° C. to 150° C.= 284° to 302° F.  26 gms.\r\n       3rd Prod. at 150° C. to 160° C.= 302° to 320° F.  29 gms.\r\n       4th Prod. at 160° C. to 170° C.= 320° to 388° F.  38 gms.\r\n       5th Prod. at 170° C. to 180° C.= 338° to 367° F.  17 gms.\r\n       6th Prod. at 180° C. to 200° C.= 356° to 392° F.  16 gms.\r\n       7th Prod. at 200° C. to 220° C.= 392° to 428° F.  17 gms.\r\n       8th Prod. at 220° C. to 270° C.= 428° to 518° F.  12 gms.\r\n       Whole quantity distilled by this method          160 gms.\r\n                                                             ———\r\n       Leaving residue in the retort                    144 gms.\r\n                                                             ———\r\n       Original quantity                                304 gms.\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 1_, as above remarked, was almost entirely water, with\r\n  a few drops of colourless oil, having an odour similar to the\r\n  original fluid, but less intense.\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 2_ was an oil perfectly colourless, very thin and\r\n  limpid, and having an exceedingly persistent odour, similar to the\r\n  crude oil, but less intense.\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 3_ was tinged slightly yellow, perfectly transparent,\r\n  and apparently as limpid as the second product, with the same odour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 4_ was more decidedly yellowish than the last, but was\r\n  in no other respect distinguishable from it.\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 5_ was more highly coloured, thicker in consistence,\r\n  and had a decided empyreumatic odour.\r\n\r\n  _Product No. 6._ This and the two subsequent products were each more\r\n  highly coloured and denser than the preceding. The last product had\r\n  the colour and consistency of honey, and the odour was less\r\n  penetrating than that of the preceding oils. The mass of crude\r\n  product remaining in the retort (equal 47.4 per cent.) was a dark,\r\n  thick, resinous-looking varnish, which was so stiff when cold that\r\n  it could be inverted without spilling. This showed no disposition to\r\n  harden or skin over by exposure to the air. The distillation was\r\n  arrested at this point in glass, by our having reached the limit of\r\n  temperature for a bath of linseed oil. The _density_ of the several\r\n  products of this distillation shows a progressive increase, thus:\r\n\r\n                                   DENSITY\r\n                             No. 2   733\r\n                             No. 3   752\r\n                             No. 4   766\r\n                             No. 5   776\r\n                             No. 6   800\r\n                             No. 7   848\r\n                             No. 8   854\r\n\r\n  To form an idea of the comparative density of these several\r\n  products, it may be well to state that sulphuric ether, which is one\r\n  of the lightest fluids known, has a density of .736, and alcohol,\r\n  when absolutely pure, .800.\r\n\r\n  The _boiling points_ of these several fluids present some anomalies,\r\n  but are usually progressive, thus, No. 2 gave signs of boiling at\r\n  115° C. (= 239° F.), and boiled vigorously and remained constant at\r\n  225° C. to 228° C. (= 437° to 442° F.). No. 3 began to boil 120° (=\r\n  248° F.), rose to 270° (= 518° F.), where it remained constant. No.\r\n  4 began to vapourise at 140° (= 284° F.), rose to 290° (= 554° F.),\r\n  where it remained constant. On a second heating the temperature\r\n  continued to rise, and passed 305° (= 581° F.). No. 5 gave\r\n  appearance of boiling at 160° (= 320° F.), boiling more vigorously\r\n  as the heat was raised, and was still rising at 308° (= 581° F.).\r\n  No. 6 commenced boiling at 135° (= 275° F.), boiled violently at\r\n  160° (= 320° F.), and continued rising above the range of the\r\n  mercurial thermometer. No. 7 commenced ebullition at the same\r\n  temperature as No. 6, and rose to 305° (= 581° F.), where the\r\n  ebullition was not very active. Much time was consumed in obtaining\r\n  these results. We infer from them that the rock-oil is a mixture of\r\n  numerous compounds, all having essentially the same chemical\r\n  constitution, but differing in density and boiling points, and\r\n  capable of separation from each other, by a well-regulated heat.\r\n\r\n  The uncertainty of the boiling points indicates that the products\r\n  obtained at the temperatures named above were still mixtures of\r\n  others, and the question forces itself upon us, whether these\r\n  several oils are to be regarded as _educts_ (i. e., bodies\r\n  previously existing, and simply separated in the process of\r\n  distillation), or whether they are not rather produced by the heat\r\n  and chemical change in the process of distillation. The continued\r\n  application of an elevated temperature alone is sufficient to effect\r\n  changes in the constitution of many organic products, evolving new\r\n  bodies not before existing in the original substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    PROPERTIES OF THE DISTILLED OILS\r\n\r\n  Exposed to the severest cold of the past winter, all the oils\r\n  obtained in this distillation remained fluid. Only the last two or\r\n  three appeared at all stiffened by a cold of 15° below zero, while\r\n  the first three or four products of distillation retained a perfect\r\n  degree of fluidity. Exposed to air, as I have said, they suffer no\r\n  change. The chemical examination of these oils showed that they were\r\n  all composed of carbon and hydrogen, and probably have these\r\n  elements in the same numerical relation. When first distilled they\r\n  all had an acid reaction, due to the presence of a small quantity of\r\n  free sulphuric acid, derived from the crude oil. This was entirely\r\n  removed by a weak alkaline water, and even by boiling on pure water.\r\n  Clean copper remained untarnished in the oil which had thus been\r\n  prepared, showing its fitness for lubrication, so far as absence of\r\n  corrosive quality is concerned. The oils contain no oxygen, as is\r\n  clearly shown by the fact that clean potassium remains bright in\r\n  them. Strong _sulphuric acid_ decomposes and destroys the oil\r\n  entirely. _Nitric acid_ changes it to a yellow, oily fluid, similar\r\n  to the changes produced by nitric acid on other oils.\r\n  _Hydrochloric_, _chromic_, and _acetic acids_ do not affect it.\r\n  _Litharge_ and other metallic oxyds do not change it, or convert it\r\n  in any degree to a drying oil. _Potassium_ remains in it unaffected,\r\n  even at a high temperature. _Hydrates of potash_, _soda_, and _lime_\r\n  are also without action upon it. _Chloride of calcium_ and many\r\n  other salts manifest an equal indifference to it. Distilled with\r\n  _bleaching powders_ (chloride of lime) and water in the manner of\r\n  producing chloroform, the oil is changed into a product having an\r\n  odour and taste resembling chloroform. Exposed for many days in an\r\n  open vessel, at a regulated heat below 212°, the oil gradually rises\r\n  in vapour, as may be seen by its staining the paper used to cover\r\n  the vessel from dust, and also by its sensible diminution. Six or\r\n  eight fluid ounces, exposed in this manner in a metallic vessel for\r\n  six weeks or more, the heat never exceeding 200°, gradually and\r\n  slowly diminished, grew yellow, and finally left a small residue of\r\n  dark brown, lustrous-looking resin, or pitchy substance, which in\r\n  the cold was hard and brittle. The samples of oil employed were very\r\n  nearly colourless. This is remarkable when we remember that the\r\n  temperature of the distillation was above 500° F. The oil is nearly\r\n  insoluble in pure alcohol, not more than 4 or 5 per cent. being\r\n  dissolved by this agent. In ether the oil dissolves completely, and\r\n  on gentle heating is left unchanged by the evaporisation of the\r\n  ether. India-rubber is dissolved by the distilled oil to a pasty\r\n  mass, forming a thick, black fluid which, after a short time,\r\n  deposits the India-rubber. It dissolved a little amber, but only\r\n  sufficient to colour the oil red. It also dissolves a small portion\r\n  of copal in its natural state, but after roasting, the copal\r\n  dissolves in it as it does in other oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           USE FOR GAS-MAKING\r\n\r\n  The crude oil was tried as a means of illumination. For this\r\n  purpose, a weighed quantity was decomposed, by passing it through a\r\n  wrought-iron retort filled with carbon, and ignited to full redness.\r\n  The products of this decomposition were received in a suitable\r\n  apparatus. It produced nearly pure carburetted hydrogen gas, the\r\n  most highly illuminating of all the carbon gases. In fact, the oil\r\n  may be regarded as chemically identical with illuminating gas in a\r\n  liquid form. The gas produced equalled ten cubic feet to the pound\r\n  of oil. It burned with an intense flame, smoking in the ordinary gas\r\n  jet, but furnishing the most perfect flame with the Argand burner.\r\n\r\n  These experiments were not prosecuted further, because it was\r\n  assumed that other products, now known and in use, for gas-making,\r\n  might be employed at less expense for this purpose, than your oil.\r\n  Nevertheless, this branch of inquiry may be worthy of further\r\n  attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DISTILLATION AT A HIGHER TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n  The results of the distillation at a regulated temperature in glass\r\n  led us to believe that in a metallic vessel, capable of enduring a\r\n  high degree of heat, we might obtain a much larger proportion of\r\n  valuable products. A copper still, holding five or six gallons, was\r\n  therefore provided, and furnished with an opening, through which a\r\n  thermometer could be introduced into the interior of the vessel.\r\n  Fourteen imperial quarts (or, by weight, 560 ounces) of the crude\r\n  product were placed in this vessel, and the heat raised rapidly to\r\n  about 280° C. (= 536° F.), somewhat higher than the last temperature\r\n  reached in the first distillation. At this high temperature the\r\n  distillation was somewhat rapid, and the product was easily\r\n  condensed without a worm. The product of the first stage was 130\r\n  ounces (or over 28 per cent.), of a very light-coloured thin oil,\r\n  having a density of .792. This product was also acid, and as before,\r\n  the acid was easily removed by boiling with fresh water. The\r\n  temperature was now raised to somewhat above 300° C. (= 572° F.),\r\n  and 123 ounces more distilled, of a more viscid and yellowish oil,\r\n  having a density of .865. This accounts for over 43 per cent. of the\r\n  whole quantity taken. The temperature being raised now above the\r\n  boiling point of mercury, was continued at that until 170 ounces, or\r\n  over 31 per cent., of a dark brown oil had been distilled, having a\r\n  strong empyreumatic odor. Upon standing still for some time, a dark\r\n  blackish sediment was seen to settle from this portion, and on\r\n  boiling it with water the unpleasant odour was in a great degree\r\n  removed, and the fluid became more light-coloured and perfectly\r\n  bright. (It was on a sample of this that the photometric experiments\r\n  were made.) The next portion, distilled at about 700° F., gave but\r\n  about 17 ounces, and this product was both lighter in colour and\r\n  more fluid than the last. It now became necessary to employ dry\r\n  hickory wood as a fuel, to obtain flame and sufficient heat to drive\r\n  over any further portions of the residue remaining in the alembic.\r\n\r\n  It will be seen that we have already accounted for over 75 per cent.\r\n  of the whole quantity taken. There was a loss on the whole process\r\n  of about 10 per cent. made up, in part, of a coaly residue that\r\n  remained in the alembic, and partly of the unavoidable loss\r\n  resulting from the necessity of removing the oil twice from the\r\n  alembic, during the process of distillation, in order to change the\r\n  arrangements of the thermometer, and provide means of measuring a\r\n  heat higher than that originally contemplated.\r\n\r\n  About 15 per cent. of a very thick, dark oil completed this\r\n  experiment. This last product, which came off slowly at about 750°\r\n  F., is thicker and darker than the original oil, and when cold, is\r\n  filled with a dense mass of pearly crystals. These are paraffine, a\r\n  peculiar product of the destructive distillation of many bodies in\r\n  the organic kingdom. This substance may be separated, and obtained\r\n  as a white body, resembling fine spermaceti, and from it beautiful\r\n  candles have been made. The oil in which the crystals float is of a\r\n  very dark colour, and by reflected light is blackish green, like the\r\n  original crude product. Although it distills at so high a\r\n  temperature, it boils at a point not very different from the denser\r\n  products of the first distillation. The paraffine, with which this\r\n  portion of the oil abounds, does not exist ready-formed in the\r\n  original crude product; but it is a result of the high temperature\r\n  employed in the process of distillation, by which the elements are\r\n  newly arranged.\r\n\r\n  I am not prepared to say, without further investigation, that it\r\n  would be desirable for the company to manufacture this product in a\r\n  pure state, fit for producing candles (a somewhat elaborate chemical\r\n  process); but I may add that, should it be desirable to do so, the\r\n  quantity of this substance produced may probably be very largely\r\n  increased by means which it is now unnecessary to mention.\r\n\r\n  Paraffine derives its name from the unalterable nature of the\r\n  substance, under the most powerful chemical agents. It is white, in\r\n  brilliant scales of a greasy lustre; it melts at about 116°, and\r\n  boils at over 700° F.; it dissolves in boiling alcohol and ether,\r\n  and burns in the air with a brilliant flame. Associated with\r\n  paraffine are portions of a very volatile oil, _eupione_, which\r\n  boils at a lower temperature, and by its presence renders the\r\n  boiling point of the mixture difficult to determine. I consider this\r\n  point worthy of further examination than I have been able at present\r\n  to give it, i.e., whether the last third, and possibly the last\r\n  half, of the petroleum, may not be advantageously so treated as to\r\n  produce from it the largest amount of paraffine which it is able to\r\n  produce.\r\n\r\n  The result of this graduated distillation, at a high temperature, is\r\n  that we have obtained over 90 per cent. of the whole crude product\r\n  in a series of oils, having valuable properties, although not all\r\n  equally fitted for illumination and lubrication.\r\n\r\n  A second distillation of a portion of the product which came over in\r\n  the later stages of the process (a portion distilled at about 650°\r\n  F., and having a high colour), gave us a thin oil of density about\r\n  .750, of light yellow colour and faint odour.\r\n\r\n  It is safe to add that, by the original distillation, about 50 per\r\n  cent. of the crude oil is obtained in a state fit for use as an\r\n  illuminator without further preparation than simple clarification by\r\n  boiling a short time with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DISTILLATION BY HIGH STEAM\r\n\r\n  Bearing in mind that by aid of high steam, at an elevated\r\n  temperature, many distillations in the arts are affected which\r\n  cannot be so well accomplished by dry heat, I thought to apply this\r\n  method in case of the present research. Instances of this mode of\r\n  distillation are in the new process for Stearine candles, and in the\r\n  preparation of rosin oil. I accordingly arranged my retort in such a\r\n  manner that I could admit a jet of high steam into the boiler, and\r\n  almost at the bottom of the contained petroleum. I was, however,\r\n  unable to command a jet of steam above 275° to 290° F., and although\r\n  this produced abundant distillation, it did not effect a separation\r\n  of the several products, and the fluid distilled had much the same\r\n  appearance as the petroleum itself, thick and turbid. As this trial\r\n  was made late in the investigation, I have been unable to give it a\r\n  satisfactory issue, chiefly for want of steam of a proper\r\n  temperature. But I suggest, for the consideration of the company,\r\n  the propriety of availing themselves of the experience already\r\n  existing on this subject, and particularly among those who are\r\n  concerned in the distillation of rosin oil—a product having many\r\n  analogies with petroleum in respect to its manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  USE OF THE NAPHTHA FOR ILLUMINATION\r\n\r\n  Many fruitless experiments have been made in the course of this\r\n  investigation which it is needless to recount. I will, therefore,\r\n  only state those results which are of value.\r\n\r\n  1. I have found that the only lamp in which this oil can be\r\n  successfully burned is the camphene lamp, or one having a button to\r\n  form the flame, and an external cone to direct the current of air,\r\n  as is now usual in all lamps designed to burn either camphene, rosin\r\n  oil, sylvic oil, or any other similar product.\r\n\r\n  2. As the distilled products of petroleum are nearly or quite\r\n  insoluble in alcohol, burning fluid (i. e., a solution of the oil in\r\n  alcohol) cannot be manufactured from it.\r\n\r\n  3. As a consequence, the oil cannot be burned in a hand lamp, since,\r\n  with an unprotected wick, it smokes badly. Neither can it be burned\r\n  in a Carcel’s mechanical lamp, because a portion of the oil being\r\n  more volatile than the rest, rises in vapour on the elevated wick\r\n  required in that lamp, and so causes it to smoke.\r\n\r\n  I have found all the products of distillation from the copper still\r\n  capable of burning well in the camphene lamp, except the last third\r\n  or fourth part (i.e., that portion which came off at 700° F. and\r\n  rising, and which was thick with the crystals of paraffine). Freed\r\n  from acidity by boiling on water, the oils of this distillation\r\n  burned for twelve hours without injuriously coating the wick, and\r\n  without smoke. The wick may be elevated considerably above the level\r\n  required for camphene, without any danger of smoking, and the oil\r\n  shows no signs of crusting the wick tubes with a coating of rosin,\r\n  such as happens in the case of camphene, and occasions so much\r\n  inconvenience. The light from the rectified naphtha is pure and\r\n  white, without odour. The rate of consumption is less than half that\r\n  of camphene, or rosin oil. The Imperial pint, of 20 fluid ounces,\r\n  was the one employed—a gallon contains 160 such ounces. A camphene\r\n  lamp, with a wick one inch thick, consumed of rectified naphtha in\r\n  one hour, 1¾ ounces of fluid. A Carcel’s mechanical lamp of ⅞–inch\r\n  wick, consumed of best sperm oil, per hour, 2 ounces. A “Diamond\r\n  Light” lamp, with “sylvic oil,” and a wick 1½–inch diameter,\r\n  consumed, per hour, 4 ounces.\r\n\r\n  I have submitted the lamp burning petroleum to the inspection of the\r\n  most experienced lampists who were accessible to me, and their\r\n  testimony was, that the lamp burning this fluid gave as much light\r\n  as any which they had seen, that the oil spent more economically,\r\n  and the uniformity of the light was greater than in camphene,\r\n  burning for twelve hours without a sensible diminution, and without\r\n  smoke. I was, however, anxious to test the amount of light given,\r\n  more accurately than could be done by a comparison of opinions. With\r\n  your approbation I proceeded therefore to have constructed a\r\n  _photometer_, or apparatus for the measurement of light, upon an\r\n  improved plan. Messrs. Grunow, scientific artists of this city,\r\n  undertook to construct this apparatus, and have done so to my entire\r\n  satisfaction. This apparatus I shall describe elsewhere—its results\r\n  only are interesting here. By its means I have brought the petroleum\r\n  light into rigid comparison with the most important means of\r\n  artificial illumination. Let us briefly recapitulate the results of\r\n  these\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PHOTOMETRIC EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n  The _unit_ adopted for comparison of intensities of illumination is\r\n  Judd’s Patent Sixes Sperm Candle.\r\n\r\n  The sperm oil used was from Edward Mott Robinson, of New Bedford—the\r\n  best winter sperm remaining fluid at 32° F. The colza oil and\r\n  Carcel’s lamps were furnished by Dardonville, lampist, Broadway, New\r\n  York. The gas used was that of the New Haven Gas Light Co., made\r\n  from best Newcastle coal, and of fair average quality.\r\n\r\n  The distance between the standard candle, and the illuminator sought\r\n  to be determined, was constantly 150 inches—the photometer traversed\r\n  the graduated bar in such a manner as to read, at any point where\r\n  equality of illumination was produced, the ratio between the two\r\n  lights. I quote only single examples of the average results, and\r\n  with as little detail as possible, but I should state that the\r\n  operation of the photometer was so satisfactory that we obtained\r\n  constantly the same figures when operating in the same way, evening\r\n  after evening, and the sensitiveness of the instrument was such that\r\n  a difference of one-half inch in its position was immediately\r\n  detected in the comparative illumination of the two equal discs of\r\n  light in the dark chamber. This is, I believe, a degree of accuracy\r\n  not before obtained by a photometer.\r\n\r\n TABLE OF ILLUMINATING POWER OF VARIOUS ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS COMPARED WITH\r\n                     JUDD’S PATENT CANDLES AS A UNIT\r\n\r\n                        SOURCE OF LIGHT                        RATIO TO\r\n                                                               CANDLE—1\r\n Gas burning in Scotch fish-tail tips, 4 feet to the hour      1 :  5.4\r\n Gas burning in Scotch fish-tail tips, 6 feet to the hour      1 :  7.55\r\n Gas burning in Cornelius fish-tail tips, 6 feet to the hour   1 :  6.3\r\n Gas burning in English Argand burner, 10 feet to the hour     1 : 16\r\n Rock-oil, burning in 1–inch wick camphene lamp, consuming 1¾\r\n   ounces of fluid to the hour                                 1 :  8.1\r\n Carcel’s mechanical lamp, burning best sperm oil, 2 ounces of\r\n   fluid to the hour, wick ⅞ of an inch                        1 :  7.5\r\n Carcel’s mechanical lamp, burning best sperm oil, 2 ounces of\r\n   colza oil to the hour, wick of ⅞ an inch                    1 :  7.5\r\n Camphene lamp (same size as rock-oil above) burning best\r\n   camphene, 4 fluid ounces per hour                           1 : 11\r\n “Diamond Light” by “sylvic oil,” in 1½–inch wick, 4 ounces\r\n   per hour                                                    1 :  8.1\r\n\r\n  From this table it will be seen that the rock-oil lamp was somewhat\r\n  superior in illuminating power to Carcel’s lamp of the same size,\r\n  burning the most costly of all oils. It was also equal to the\r\n  “Diamond Light” from a lamp of one-half greater power, and\r\n  consequently is superior to it in the same ratio in lamps of equal\r\n  power. The camphene lamp appears to be about one-fifth superior to\r\n  it, but, on the other hand, the rock-oil surpasses the camphene by\r\n  more than one-half in economy of consumption (i.e., it does not\r\n  consume one-half so much fluid by measure), and it burns more\r\n  constantly. Compared with the sylvic oil and the sperm, the rock-oil\r\n  gave on the ground glass diaphragm the whitest disc of illumination,\r\n  while in turn the camphene was whiter than the rock-oil light. By\r\n  the use of screens of different coloured glass, all inequalities of\r\n  _colour_ were compensated in the use of the photometer, so that the\r\n  intensity of light could be more accurately compared. Compared with\r\n  gas, the rock-oil gave more light than any burner used except the\r\n  costly Argand consuming ten feet of gas per hour. To compare the\r\n  _cost_ of these several fluids with each other, we know the price of\r\n  the several articles, and this varies very much in different places.\r\n  Thus, gas in New Haven costs $4 per 1,000 feet, and in New York\r\n  $3.50 per 1,000, in Philadelphia $2.00 per 1,000, and in Boston\r\n  about the same amount.\r\n\r\n  Such sperm oil as was used costs $2.50 per gallon, the colza about\r\n  $2, the sylvic oil 50 cents, and the camphene 68 cents; no price has\r\n  been fixed upon for the rectified rock-oil.\r\n\r\n  I cannot refrain from expressing my satisfaction at the results of\r\n  these photometric experiments, since they have given the oil of your\r\n  company a much higher value as an illuminator than I had dared to\r\n  hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n           USE OF THE ROCK-OIL AS A LUBRICATOR FOR MACHINERY\r\n\r\n  A portion of the rectified oil was sent to Boston to be tested upon\r\n  a trial apparatus there, but I regret to say that the results have\r\n  not been communicated to me yet. As this oil does not gum or become\r\n  acid or rancid by exposure, it possesses in that, as well as in its\r\n  wonderful resistance to extreme cold, important qualities for a\r\n  lubricator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  In conclusion, gentlemen, it appears to me that there is much ground\r\n  for encouragement in the belief that your company have in their\r\n  possession a raw material from which, by simple and not expensive\r\n  process, they may manufacture very valuable products.\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that my experiments prove that nearly the\r\n  _whole_ of the raw product may be manufactured without waste, and\r\n  this solely by a well-directed process which is in practice one of\r\n  the most simple of all chemical processes.\r\n\r\n  There are suggestions of a practical nature, as to the economy of\r\n  your manufacture, when you are ready to begin operations, which I\r\n  shall be happy to make, should the company require it; meanwhile, I\r\n  remain, gentlemen,\r\n\r\n                                                Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                         B.

Baslington, in their affidavits filed\r\n  herein in respect to transportation of oil, and in regard thereto he\r\n  has to say that his experience with the oil traffic began in 1868\r\n  when he went upon the Lake Shore Railroad as vice-president,\r\n  succeeding Mr. Stone who retired from ill health; that the only\r\n  written memoranda connected with the business of the company with\r\n  which he was furnished was a book in which it was stated—probably in\r\n  Mr. Stone’s handwriting—that the representatives of the various oil\r\n  interests of Cleveland would agree to pay a rate of 1 cent. per\r\n  gallon on crude oil moved from the regions to Cleveland; that in\r\n  addition to the inevitable friction arising from the competition of\r\n  these refiners of Cleveland—probably aggregating twenty-five in\r\n  number, was the further difficulty of the patent right which the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad claimed to the transportation of oil, and the\r\n  peculiar differences made by them in the rates given to refiners at\r\n  Titusville, Pittsburg, and other places all thoroughly in\r\n  competition with the then very limited refining capacity of\r\n  Cleveland; that he took up the subject as to whether the Lake Shore\r\n  Railroad could hope to compete for the transportation of oil, and\r\n  the end of the matter was that the Jamestown and Franklin Railroad\r\n  was extended from Franklin to Oil City, the then centre of the\r\n  producing district, and a sharper contest than ever was produced,\r\n  growing out of the opposition of the Pennsylvania Railroad in\r\n  competition; that such rates and arrangements were made by the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, that it was publicly proclaimed in the public\r\n  print in Oil City, Titusville, and other places that Cleveland was\r\n  to be wiped out as a refining centre as with a sponge, and without\r\n  exception the oil refiners of Cleveland came to affiant as a\r\n  representative of transportation, and with a single exception\r\n  expressed their fears that they would have either to abandon their\r\n  business here or move to Titusville or other points in the Oil\r\n  Regions; that the only exception to this decision was that offered\r\n  by Rockefeller, Andrews and Flagler, who on its assurance that the\r\n  Lake Shore Railroad could and would handle oil as cheaply as the\r\n  Pennsylvania Company, proposed to stand their ground at Cleveland\r\n  and fight it out on that line. That later, about 1870, the first\r\n  move was made to transport refined oil by rail regularly and\r\n  throughout the entire year from Cleveland to New York. That prior to\r\n  that time the export business from Cleveland was comparatively\r\n  limited and was confined to the summer months, most of that portion\r\n  of the traffic refined at Cleveland in competition with Pittsburg,\r\n  Titusville, and other places being shipped by lake and canal, and as\r\n  affiant remembers at a rate of about one dollar per barrel, and with\r\n  a certainty of its being reduced to ninety cents. That the rail rate\r\n  was nominally two dollars on refined oil from Cleveland to New York.\r\n  That Mr. Flagler, at this time representing Rockefeller, Andrews and\r\n  Flagler, proposed to make regular monthly shipments by rail\r\n  throughout the year provided a proper rate could be made for the\r\n  business then offered, this rate to cover transportation of crude\r\n  from the region to Cleveland, and when refined from Cleveland to New\r\n  York. Rockefeller, Andrews and Flagler being the only refiners here\r\n  who proposed to compete for the export business or offered oil for\r\n  the entire haul from the regions to Cleveland and thence to New\r\n  York; that Mr. Flagler’s proposition was to assure to the Lake Shore\r\n  Railroad sixty carloads of refined oil per day[83] from Cleveland to\r\n  New York at a rate of $1.75 per barrel from the regions to New York,\r\n  being thirty-five cents per barrel for crude from the regions to\r\n  Cleveland and $1.30 per barrel for refined from Cleveland to New\r\n  York; and Rockefeller, Andrews and Flagler were to assume all risk\r\n  and losses from fire or other accidents. That affiant took this\r\n  proposition into consideration and made careful computation of the\r\n  cost of this transportation to the railroad, which cost is the\r\n  proper basis in fixing the rate to be charged; that affiant found\r\n  that the then average time for a round trip from Cleveland to New\r\n  York for a freight car was thirty days; to carry sixty cars per day\r\n  would require 1,800 cars at an average cost of $500 each, making an\r\n  investment of $900,000 necessary to do this business, as the\r\n  ordinary freight business had to be done; but affiant found that if\r\n  sixty carloads could be assured with absolute regularity each and\r\n  every day, the time for a round trip from Cleveland to New York and\r\n  return could be reduced to ten days, by moving these cars in solid\r\n  trains instead of mixing oil cars in other trains, as would be\r\n  necessary when transported in small quantities and by moving the oil\r\n  trains steadily without regard to other cars; that by thus reducing\r\n  the time to ten days for a round trip, only six hundred cars would\r\n  be necessary to do this business with an investment therefore of\r\n  only $300,000. That the regularity of the traffic would insure\r\n  promptness in the unloading and return of the cars; that upon these\r\n  considerations affiant concluded that Mr. Flagler’s proposition\r\n  offered to the railroad company a larger measure of profit than\r\n  would or could ensue from any business to be carried under the old\r\n  arrangements, and such proved to be pre-eminently the case; that the\r\n  proposition of Mr. Flagler was therefore accepted, and in affiant’s\r\n  judgment this was the turning-point which secured to Cleveland a\r\n  considerable portion of the export traffic. That this arrangement\r\n  was at all times open to any and all parties who would secure or\r\n  guarantee a like amount of traffic or an amount sufficient to be\r\n  treated and handled in the same speedy and economical way, the\r\n  charges for transportation being always necessarily based upon the\r\n  actual cost of the service to the railroad, and whenever any shipper\r\n  or shippers will unite to reduce the cost of transportation to the\r\n  railroad, to refuse to give them the benefit of such reduction would\r\n  be to the detriment of the public, the consumers, who in the end pay\r\n  the transportation charges. Affiant says that this legitimate and\r\n  necessary advantage of the large shipper over the smaller he\r\n  explained to Mr. Hanna and Mr. Baslington, and they recognised its\r\n  propriety, and affiant offered them the same terms if by themselves\r\n  or with others they would assure him like quantities with like\r\n  regularity, thus securing like speed and economy in transportation.\r\n  And further affiant saith not.\r\n\r\n                                                       J.

FLAGLER ON THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 289–290.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A._ ... Neither of the Messrs. Rockefeller, Colonel Payne, nor\r\n  myself, nor any one connected with the Standard Oil Company, ever\r\n  had any confidence in or regard for the scheme known as the South\r\n  Improvement Company. We did not believe in it, but the view\r\n  presented by other gentlemen was pressed upon us to such an extent\r\n  that we acquiesced in it to the extent of subscribing our names to a\r\n  certain amount of the stock, which was never paid for. The company\r\n  never did a dollar’s worth of business, and never had any existence\r\n  other than its corporative existence, which it obtained through its\r\n  charter. Through its president it negotiated certain railroad\r\n  contracts, which, as I remember now, were signed by the company and\r\n  by the officers of the railroad. Those contracts were held in escrow\r\n  a few weeks and were destroyed or cancelled by mutual consent.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Who presented these views to you gentlemen? Who was the person\r\n  that had charge of this South Improvement Company’s scheme?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think Mr. Warden and the Messrs. Logan were the great leaders\r\n  in the South Improvement Company policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NUMBER 5 (See page 1062)\r\n  CONTRACT BETWEEN THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY AND THE PENNSYLVANIA\r\n                RAILROAD COMPANY, DATED JANUARY 18, 1872\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 357–361.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agreement made and entered into this eighteenth day of January, in\r\n  the year eighteen hundred and seventy-two, by and between the South\r\n  Improvement Company, a corporation organised and existing under the\r\n  laws of the State of Pennsylvania, party hereto of the first part,\r\n  and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, on its own behalf and on\r\n  behalf of all other railroad companies, whose roads are controlled,\r\n  owned, or leased by it, or with which it has sufficient running\r\n  arrangements, which other roads are herein described as the\r\n  connections of the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company, party hereto\r\n  of the second part.\r\n\r\n  WITNESSETH:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, the party hereto of the first part has been organized for\r\n  the purpose, among other things, of increasing, facilitating, and\r\n  developing the trade in and the conveyance and transportation of\r\n  petroleum and its products, and for that purpose proposes, among\r\n  other things, to expend large sums of money in the purchase,\r\n  erection, and construction of, and maintaining and conducting works\r\n  for storage, distillation, and refining, warehousing and\r\n  transportation, and in various other ways, upon the inducement,\r\n  among other things, of this contract.\r\n\r\n  _And Whereas_, the magnitude and extent of the business and\r\n  operations proposed to be carried on by the party hereto of the\r\n  first part will greatly promote the interest of the party hereto of\r\n  the second part, and make it desirable for it, by fixing certain\r\n  rates of freight, drawbacks, and rebates, and by the other\r\n  provisions of this _agreement_, to encourage the outlay proposed by\r\n  the party hereto of the first part, and to facilitate and increase\r\n  the transportation to be received from it.\r\n\r\n  _And Whereas_, it has been agreed by and between the party hereto of\r\n  the second part, for itself and its connections, the Erie Railroad\r\n  Company, for itself and its connections, and the New York Central\r\n  Railroad Company, for itself and its connections, that the business\r\n  of transporting, by railroad, crude petroleum and its products,\r\n  toward the Atlantic coast, from the points of production and\r\n  refining, on their lines of road, shall be allotted by the party\r\n  hereto of the first part, to the said three companies, in the\r\n  proposition of forty-five (45) per cent. of the whole to the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for itself and its connections,\r\n  including the Philadelphia and Erie Railway, the Northern Central\r\n  Railway, the Alleghany Valley Railroad, Camden and Amboy Railway,\r\n  the Pennsylvania Company, and all other railroads which are, or may\r\n  be, controlled, owned, and leased by it, or with which it has, or\r\n  may have, sufficient running arrangements; twenty-seven and a half\r\n  (27½) per cent. of the whole to the Erie Railway Company, for itself\r\n  and its connections, and twenty-seven and a half (27½) per cent. of\r\n  the whole to the New York Central Railroad Company for itself and\r\n  its connections, and that the transportation beyond Cleveland and\r\n  Pittsburg over the railroads of the said companies and their\r\n  connections, in other directions than toward the Atlantic coast,\r\n  west from said points of production and refining, shall be allotted\r\n  by the party hereto of the first part, in the proportion of\r\n  one-third thereof, to the party hereto of the second part, for\r\n  itself and its western connections, and the remainder to other\r\n  railroads.\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, this agreement witnesseth: That the parties hereto\r\n  for themselves and their successors, in consideration of the\r\n  promises, of the mutual execution hereof, and of the mutual\r\n  advantages hereby conferred, have covenanted and agreed, and hereby\r\n  do covenant and agree each with the other, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ARTICLE FIRST\r\n\r\n  The party hereto of the first part covenants and agrees:\r\n\r\n  1.

BASLINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the case of the Standard Oil Company _vs._ William C. Scofield,\r\n  _et al._, in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1869, they (Hanna, Baslington & Company) began the\r\n  construction of refining works just above the Atlantic depot on the\r\n  west side of the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad track, and invested\r\n  in the construction of the works about $67,000, which works were\r\n  completed so as to commence the refining business about the first of\r\n  June, 1869, and from that time up to about the first of July, 1870,\r\n  the works had netted a profit of $40,000 over all expenses of\r\n  running said works, being about 60 per cent. on the capital invested\r\n  per annum, and from that time on up to the first of April, 1872,\r\n  said firm cleared $21,000, being about 30 per cent. per annum on the\r\n  investment from the time that said firm commenced business.\r\n\r\n  Some time in February, 1872, the firm received a message from the\r\n  Standard Oil Company requesting said firm to have an interview as to\r\n  the disposal of the refining works of said firm; that they were\r\n  indisposed to enter into any arrangement for the disposition of said\r\n  works because the investment of capital in said works had proved\r\n  abundantly profitable to their satisfaction and they had no\r\n  disposition whatever to part with the works; but upon investigation\r\n  they were somewhat surprised to find that the Standard Oil Company\r\n  had already obtained the substantial control of the different\r\n  refineries in the City of Cleveland; that it had obtained such rates\r\n  of transportation of crude and refined oil from the different\r\n  railroads that it was impossible for them to compete with it, and\r\n  upon an interview which was had by Mr. Hanna and affiant with Mr.\r\n  Rockefeller who was at the time president of the Standard Oil\r\n  Company. Mr. Flagler, the secretary of the company, being present,\r\n  Mr. Rockefeller in substance declared or said that the Standard Oil\r\n  Company had such control of the refining business already in the\r\n  City of Cleveland that he thought said firm of Hanna, Baslington &\r\n  Company could not make any money; that there was no use for them to\r\n  attempt to do business in competition with the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that after having had an interview both with\r\n  Mr. Watson, who was the president of a company called “The South\r\n  Improvement Company,” and Mr. Devereux, who was the general manager\r\n  of the Lake Shore Road, he became satisfied that no arrangement\r\n  whatever could be effected through which transportation could at\r\n  least be obtained on the Lake Shore Road that would enable their\r\n  firm to compete with the Standard Oil Company, the works of said\r\n  Hanna, Baslington & Company, being so situated that they could only\r\n  obtain their crude oil through the line of the Lake Shore Road. And\r\n  finding that the Standard Oil Company had such special rates of\r\n  transportation that unless the firm of Hanna, Baslington & Company\r\n  were enabled to bring as much oil as the Standard Oil Company, that\r\n  it was impossible for said firm of Hanna, Baslington & Company to\r\n  obtain a fair competing rate with the Standard Oil Company. They at\r\n  least came to the conclusion that it was better for them to take\r\n  what they could get from the Standard Oil Company and let their\r\n  works go.\r\n\r\n  And affiant further says that under these circumstances they sold\r\n  their works to the Standard Oil Company, which were on the day of\r\n  the sale worth at least $100,000, for $45,000 because that was all\r\n  they could obtain from them, and works too which in cash cost them\r\n  not less than $76,000, and which with a fair competition would have\r\n  paid them an income of not less than 30 per cent. per annum on the\r\n  investment.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that at the interviews which he had with Mr.\r\n  Rockefeller, Mr. Rockefeller told him that the Standard Oil Company\r\n  already had control of all the large refineries in the City of\r\n  Cleveland and there was no use for them to undertake to compete\r\n  against the Standard Oil Company, for it would only ultimate in\r\n  their being wiped out, or language to that effect.—(November 1,\r\n  1880.)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  George O. Baslington being duly sworn (November 12, 1880) says: That\r\n  the firm of Hanna, Baslington & Company, the first year they were in\r\n  business, made profit amounting to a little less than $40,000 and\r\n  from the end of the first year up to the time of the sale to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company they made no profit at all. At the time of the\r\n  sale the firm reserved the privilege of running the works to close\r\n  up and run them up to about April 1, 1872, and during that time they\r\n  made profit to the amount of about $21,000. At the time my former\r\n  affidavit was drawn by Mr. Tyler, I stated these facts to him.\r\n\r\n  In the sale of the works to the Standard Oil Company we were given\r\n  the option to take cash or to take stock in the Standard Oil Company\r\n  at par. We decided to and did take cash, and one reason that\r\n  influenced us to take cash was that we were fearful that refining\r\n  oil at Cleveland might not be successful, and if so, the cash was\r\n  better than the stock, and affiant wanted the cash to enable him to\r\n  embark in other pursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NUMBER 8 (See page 1072)\r\n         ORGANISATION OF THE PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION OF 1872\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From “A History of the Rise and Fall of the South Improvement\r\n  Company,” pages 8–10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.

The party of the first part, that it will appoint five of its\r\n  members to form, with a like number of the party of the second part,\r\n  a joint executive committee, who shall choose some competent and\r\n  discreet person not of their number who shall serve as the chairman\r\n  and the eleventh member of the joint committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.

The party of the second part that it will agree to increase and\r\n  lessen the aggregate production of crude petroleum, as the said\r\n  joint committee shall direct, to adapt as nearly as practicable the\r\n  supply of the same to the capacity of the markets of the world to\r\n  absorb at a price remunerative to the producer, the refiner and the\r\n  transporter.\r\n\r\n  VII. The parties hereto mutually, that the said joint committee\r\n  shall, at the beginning of each year, fix the minimum average price\r\n  at which crude petroleum can be produced and delivered on board\r\n  railway cars, which price shall be called the minimum cost of\r\n  production—that at the same periods the said committee shall also\r\n  fix the minimum average price at which crude oil can be refined, put\r\n  up in packages and sold, which price shall be called the minimum\r\n  cost of manufacture.\r\n\r\n  VIII. The parties hereto mutually, that after paying the minimum\r\n  cost of production of crude petroleum, the minimum cost of its\r\n  manufacture, and the cost of transportation and storage, and\r\n  shipping also, in the case of exported oil, the profits shall be\r\n  apportioned between the producers and refiners, in the ratio of ...\r\n  per cent. to the former, and ... per cent. to the latter.\r\n\r\n  IX. The said parties, that in case of a temporary over-production of\r\n  crude petroleum, the excess shall as far as practicable be taken and\r\n  withheld from market, and an advance of three-fourths of the minimum\r\n  cost of production advanced thereon by the party of the first part\r\n  at eight per cent., intrust the party of the second part keeping the\r\n  tanked petroleum insured in good and responsible companies to the\r\n  full amount of the advance, one year’s interest added.\r\n\r\n  X. The said parties mutually, that the party of the first part shall\r\n  only be bound to pay the prices and make the advances aforesaid, in\r\n  case the producers shall in good faith obey the instructions of the\r\n  joint committee, to limit production by stopping the drilling of new\r\n  wells.\r\n\r\n  XI. The party of the second part that it will keep a register of the\r\n  date of the commencement of all new wells, the date at which the\r\n  same shall be finished, the character of the well and the monthly\r\n  production, and the date at which it may be abandoned, and that it\r\n  will make it a condition, precedent to the holding of stock in its\r\n  company, that the date aforesaid shall be finished by its\r\n  stockholders.\r\n\r\n  XII. Both parties, that it is the especial object of this agreement\r\n  to bring the producers and refiners of petroleum into harmony and\r\n  co-operation, by reciprocal, fair, and just dealing, for the\r\n  promotion of their mutual interests, and everything in this\r\n  agreement is to be construed liberally for the carrying into effect\r\n  of this object.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 11 (See page 1082)\r\n              EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF W.

State the\r\n  amount of capital and stock subscribed and put in?\r\n\r\n  _A._ At that time 1,100 shares, at $100 per share, was subscribed,\r\n  and twenty per cent. thereon paid into the treasury.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Where did that company intend to refine oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Their calculation was to get all the refineries in the country\r\n  into the company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was it the design of the stockholders to include all the oil\r\n  refineries in this country?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir; every one of them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Can you give us a list of the stockholders?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I can give you them from the minutes. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n                    William Frew           10 shares\r\n                    W. P. Logan            10   〃\r\n                    John P.

We also had considerable discussion with the railroads in regard\r\n  to the matter of rebate on their charges for freight; they did not\r\n  want to give us a rebate unless it was with the understanding that\r\n  all the refineries should be brought into the arrangement and placed\r\n  upon the same level; there was no difference made as far as we were\r\n  concerned, in favour of or against any refinery; they were all to\r\n  come in alike; that was the understanding from the first to the\r\n  last.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Where are the refineries situated?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Situated in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, on the\r\n  seaboard, and in the Oil Region, Pittsburg, and Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You say you made propositions to railroad companies, which they\r\n  agreed to accept upon the condition that you could include all the\r\n  refineries?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; I did not say that; I said that was the understanding\r\n  when we discussed this matter with them; it was no proposition on\r\n  our part; they discussed it not in the form of a proposition that\r\n  the refineries should be all taken in, but it was the intention and\r\n  resolution of the company from the first that that should be the\r\n  result; we never had any other purpose in the matter.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In case you could take the refineries all in, the railroads\r\n  proposed to give you a rebate upon their freight charges?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; it was not put in that form; we were to put the\r\n  refineries all in, upon the same terms; it was the understanding\r\n  with the railroad companies that we were to have a rebate; there was\r\n  no rebate given in consideration of our putting the companies all\r\n  in, but we told them we would do it; the contract with the railroad\r\n  companies was with us.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But if you did form a company composed of the proprietors of\r\n  all these refineries, you were to have a rebate upon your freight\r\n  charges?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No; we were to have the rebate anyhow; but were to give all the\r\n  refineries the privilege of coming in.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You were to have the rebate whether they came in or not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were you to have a rebate upon the same freight charges that\r\n  had been in existence before?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No; the whole object of the railroad authorities was to get\r\n  better freight prices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What effect was this arrangement to have upon the producer or\r\n  upon the refineries that did not go into your combination?\r\n\r\n  _A._ According to our opinion of it that is the way we have got into\r\n  this trouble; we have been misconstrued and misrepresented as to our\r\n  purposes all over the country; the whole object was, and our whole\r\n  talk was, as far as any of my friends came into the matter, or as\r\n  far as I myself was concerned, that the producers should receive a\r\n  better price for their oil; we calculated to get five or six dollars\r\n  a barrel for crude oil; that was from the beginning of our talk\r\n  until the end of it; we had not our company organised, or at least\r\n  the organisation was not completed, nor the contract signed, until\r\n  all these disturbances commenced to be gotten up; we thought the\r\n  matter would quiet down and we would get a chance to explain our\r\n  position and put ourselves right; we asked for the opportunity to do\r\n  so; we have evidence of that in the telegrams we sent, and I can\r\n  say, under oath, that they were sent in good faith; there was never\r\n  an idea in my mind that they were not.... I will state further that\r\n  this matter was discussed with Mr. Scott by myself, personally, and\r\n  in very great length, and also with Mr. Potts, who never has had any\r\n  interest and never any part in this contract, and who spoke of this\r\n  very matter from the start, expressing the opinion that it could not\r\n  succeed unless the producers were taken care of. That was understood\r\n  by us all from the start in every discussion we had, and by the\r\n  railroad people as far as I heard from them. I can only answer for\r\n  the railroad people from the conversation I had personally with Mr.\r\n  Scott and Mr. Potts, in which it was perfectly understood that we\r\n  could not succeed in carrying out these measures for our own benefit\r\n  and the benefit of the railroads without the co-operation of the\r\n  producers, and the only point we discussed was whether it should be\r\n  a combination or co-operation. I took the ground personally against\r\n  forming a combination inasmuch as the interests of the producers\r\n  were in one sense antagonistic to ours, one as the seller and the\r\n  other as the buyer. We held in argument that the producers were\r\n  abundantly able to take care of their own branch of the business if\r\n  they took care of the quantity produced. They were only liable to\r\n  depression from our production, therefore they had in their own\r\n  hands directly the power of holding the market at six or eight\r\n  dollars a barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You did not take into consideration the good of the consumers\r\n  of the country, which is by far the larger part of the population of\r\n  the country?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, we did.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You wanted to put up the price of oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ In answer to that I will state that the producers and refiners\r\n  were both suffering under the depression that existed. The refiners\r\n  were not getting enough to pay their expenses. All we asked was a\r\n  fair refiner’s profit.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What effect were these arrangements to have upon those who did\r\n  not come into the combination or co-operation, as you have termed\r\n  it, as to the price to be charged for transporting their oil, both\r\n  refiners and producers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not think we ever took that question up.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were the railroad companies to charge the same increase of\r\n  freights to those who did not come into the combination that they\r\n  did to you without giving them a rebate?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now in case you could control the oil produced by these people\r\n  in any combination that you made, were you not to have a rebate upon\r\n  the oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We were not to have a rebate, we were to have a drawback.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is the difference between a rebate and a drawback?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There is not much difference in one sense. A rebate is made at\r\n  the time we pay our freight; a drawback is made afterward.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That is a technical, rather than a real, difference, is it not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I want to state it as you will find it in the contract.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The effect was that those who did not go into the combination\r\n  could not get their oil as cheaply as you could?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; they could not; I want to explain in what relation\r\n  that occurred and why this arrangement was made. I may say that it\r\n  never entered into my head that the refineries would not all be\r\n  brought in; a fair manufacturer’s profit was all we wanted. They\r\n  were all to be brought in on equal terms, and the object of the\r\n  drawback was not to cover all the oil to be refined in this country,\r\n  but only the oil that was to be exported.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If all had gone into the combination, then the result would not\r\n  have been to injure the producers and refiners, but to injure the\r\n  consumers of the country?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; the purpose was not to injure them.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Would it not have been to increase the price of oil, if you had\r\n  increased the cost of freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You say the railroad companies were going to increase the rate\r\n  of freight anyhow; they had the right to do that if they were\r\n  carrying too low, but would that justify them in increasing the\r\n  rates of freight to such an extent that they could afford to give\r\n  you a sum of money for it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I will tell you how that was done. The men in our trade are a\r\n  very hard kind of men to hold. Those of us who deal in oil know that\r\n  when we have purchased a lot, they would deliver it in New York for\r\n  less than anybody could afford to deliver it. That has been the fact\r\n  almost continuously ever since 1869. Oil has been delivered in the\r\n  East for less money than was apparent from any rates known to the\r\n  market; less than even we who refined it could deliver it for. The\r\n  railroads were kept constantly besieged by one or another, and they\r\n  were continually cutting under other routes for New York or for\r\n  Cleveland, so that nobody knew what the rates were. They have been\r\n  paying rebates, more or less, for the last two years.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And you contemplated an increase of rates for the simple\r\n  purpose of having the railroads divide with you?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There was no divide.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ A rebate is a divide to a certain extent, is it not? The\r\n  proposition was that there should be taken out of the producers and\r\n  consumers of this country a certain percentage of the freight for\r\n  you?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was done to prevent this cutting of roads one under another,\r\n  and to prevent speculation.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was it not done for the purpose of oppressing the producers and\r\n  consumers of this country?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I can only deny that such was the object, or that such would\r\n  have been the effect.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Has it been the practice of both the producer and refiner to\r\n  make combinations from time to time by storing oils, and by large\r\n  shipments abroad to affect the general price in the market?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The producers have made such combinations on the creek, and a\r\n  few of the refiners and merchants made two combinations in 1868,\r\n  which was known as the Deboe combination, and in 1869 and 1870 the\r\n  Bull Ring, as they called it; but there was no combination that I\r\n  knew of on the part of the producers, except among themselves; they\r\n  have several times combined among themselves.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have there not been combinations of producers, refiners, and\r\n  merchants to affect the price of oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There have been all kinds of combinations.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is there not at this time, if not invalidated by a change of\r\n  directors of the Erie Railroad Company, a combination between\r\n  officers of that road and certain parties in New York by which they\r\n  control the price of coal?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If I were allowed to say what I think, I should reply in the\r\n  affirmative and to say that one great reason why we went into this\r\n  arrangement was to stop that Erie combination, which was a great\r\n  source of difficulty; we could not get hold of the matter; we would\r\n  ship a cargo of oil at a fair price to-day, and would be compelled\r\n  to sell it to-morrow at a much less price; this arrangement did\r\n  break up that combination entirely, so that there is no combination\r\n  of that sort to-day.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I understand that your larger combinations swallowed up the\r\n  Erie combination.\r\n\r\n  _A._ It destroyed it at the time.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Yours was somewhat in the direction of the Erie combination,\r\n  but larger?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; it was not; the Erie was with some merchants, ours\r\n  embraces the whole refining interest in the country; that was\r\n  different; I will state that since I came into this Capitol I have\r\n  been told that the very men engaged in prosecuting this\r\n  investigation have a combination by which they intend to run up the\r\n  price of their oil; I hope they will; I do not care what means are\r\n  used, so that we can carry on our business, and pay just what others\r\n  have to pay.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I understand you to say that under your arrangement the cost of\r\n  crude oil might be increased $1.25 a barrel, and that there is\r\n  produced about 18,000 barrels daily in the Oil Regions of\r\n  Pennsylvania, but not that on an average; can you state from memory\r\n  about the amount of annual production?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have a circular here which gives the statement as 5,775,000\r\n  barrels.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ So that the production in round numbers for last year was\r\n  6,000,000 barrels; now, of this $1.25, how much were you to get as\r\n  your drawback if you had carried out your arrangement?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The maximum we would have been entitled to receive is one\r\n  dollar a barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then on this production you would have received $6,000,000 a\r\n  year, and the railroad companies an additional sum of $1,500,000; in\r\n  other words, under your arrangement the public would have been put\r\n  to an additional expense of $7,500,000 a year.\r\n\r\n  _A._ What public do you refer to? They would have had to pay it in\r\n  Europe.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Negley.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were there not at the same time combinations upon the part of\r\n  producers to affect the price of oil in the market?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There were not at the time we started this matter; I do not\r\n  know of any just at that moment; there have been over and over\r\n  again. I want to state that a large portion of our oil product goes\r\n  to Europe—of this very crude oil which Mr. Sheldon talks about; I\r\n  have here a circular to which I call the attention of the committee,\r\n  which bears out our position in this matter; I desire to put it in\r\n  evidence because it gives the general opinion of merchants connected\r\n  with the exportation of crude oil. It has been the impression of\r\n  everybody in the trade that the oil exported should pay us an\r\n  additional amount in this country, to be divided between those\r\n  interested in the handling of it and the producing of it, to the\r\n  extent of eight or ten millions a year; I have had that figured out\r\n  three, or four, or five successive years. We have shown over and\r\n  over again that that amount ought to be retained in this country. I\r\n  have been engaged for several years in the oil business, and I have\r\n  yet to sell one barrel to bear the market. I have always been upon\r\n  the bull side of the market; I believe there ought to be in this\r\n  country a better price for oil to every one engaged in it. In 1868,\r\n  1869, and 1870, there were movements in oil which brought to this\r\n  country millions of dollars; and if the producers had refrained from\r\n  sending forward their oil beyond the requirements of the market, the\r\n  price would have been sustained. That has been the trouble always in\r\n  making movements for a higher price. There is no man in this country\r\n  who would not quietly and calmly say that we ought to have a better\r\n  price for these goods.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you mean a better price here, or a better price for that\r\n  exported?\r\n\r\n  _A._ You could not get a better price for that exported without\r\n  having a better price here.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That is what the committee wants to know, whether it is\r\n  necessary, in order to keep up the price abroad, to keep up the\r\n  price at home?\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 12 (See page 1082)\r\n             EXTRACTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF PETER H. WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From “A History of the Rise and Fall of the South Improvement\r\n  Company,” pages 76–96.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     WASHINGTON, D. C., April 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Townsend.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ From such testimony as you have given this morning, am I\r\n  correct in understanding that this whole arrangement was suspended\r\n  before its completion and before anything was done under it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That no completion of contracts was consummated?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; the conditions of the original understanding about the\r\n  contracts, on which alone they were to go into effect, had not been\r\n  complied with.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And a further arrangement was necessary to make it a complete\r\n  contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, the South Improvement Company had to enter into a\r\n  contract, such substantially as I have furnished a draft of here, to\r\n  give the producers the full benefit of everything connected with the\r\n  contract before the contract itself could go into effect.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ There are three principal interests connected with the oil\r\n  trade?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There are, the producers, refiners and transporters; no\r\n  injustice could be done to either interest without affecting,\r\n  injuriously, the others. The object of the railroads in this matter\r\n  was to promote the interests of the trade in order to promote their\r\n  own interests.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You say there were three interests, producers, refiners and\r\n  shippers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, connected with the trade.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And that the object of all these arrangements was to protect\r\n  these three interests?\r\n\r\n  _A._ To protect these three interests and incidentally, of course,\r\n  protecting the general interest in doing that, for this is\r\n  peculiarly an American traffic.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ It was in the direction of increasing to each of these parties,\r\n  respectively the benefits and profits of the business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, that each might receive a fair profit. The railroad\r\n  companies had not been receiving cost for transportation, and it was\r\n  to save them from loss, for they had been transporting at a loss\r\n  during the whole of the year 1871.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Well, that is to increase profits, is it not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, to save from loss.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did it look to increasing in any way the benefits of cheapness\r\n  to the consumer?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How?\r\n\r\n  _A._ By steadying the trade. You will notice what all those familiar\r\n  with this trade know, that there are very rapid and excessive\r\n  fluctuations in the oil market; that when these fluctuations take\r\n  place the retail dealers are always quick to note a rise in price,\r\n  but very slow to note a fall. Even if two dollars a barrel had been\r\n  added to the price of oil, under a steady trade, I think the price\r\n  of the retail purchaser would not have been increased. That\r\n  increased price would only amount to one cent a quart, and I think\r\n  the price would not have been increased to the retail dealer because\r\n  the fluctuation would have been avoided. That was one object to be\r\n  accomplished. Moreover, there is only one-sixth of the oil produced\r\n  here consumed in this country—a very small proportion of the\r\n  product. In discussing what compensating advantage would arise from\r\n  an increase of price, the railroad companies considered, in the\r\n  first place, that there was a very great compensation afforded by a\r\n  steady trade.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will you state to the committee how, with your mode of arriving\r\n  at these conclusions, that cheapness to the consumer is promoted by\r\n  stability in trade—how that arrangement which gave $1.50 a barrel to\r\n  the South Improvement Company benefited either the railroad company\r\n  or the producer?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, sir, in the agreement you will observe that the maximum\r\n  rebates and maximum rates are stated. These maximum rebates were\r\n  exceptions to the rule, which is a cardinal principle in the\r\n  contract. The actual rates were to be kept as near to net rates as\r\n  possible. Moreover, this was a contract which, before it was to go\r\n  into effect, would have been a contract with the producer as well as\r\n  the refiner.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Does this contract show that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The draft of a contract which I have presented to the\r\n  committee, and which was to have been entered into with the\r\n  producers before the contracts with the railroad companies went into\r\n  operation, shows that.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Does this contract say that anything was to be done in behalf\r\n  of the producer before it was to go into operation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not on the face of the contract; it was only a condition on\r\n  which it was delivered to me.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ A written condition so that it would become a part of the\r\n  contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was a part of the contract.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I asked you whether there was anything in writing?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I said there was nothing in writing on the face of the\r\n  contract, but nevertheless it was an essential part of it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ It seems to be essential now that it should be a part of the\r\n  contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was all the time so considered from the beginning.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was this draft of a contract with the producers drawn prior to\r\n  the execution of the railroad contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, the draft was drawn prior to that.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What is the date of that pencilled draft of a contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I could not give you the date of it; it was written in the\r\n  office of the Lake Shore Railroad Company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ At what place?\r\n\r\n  _A._ New York.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ State as near as you can the date?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I should say it was probably in December; either late in\r\n  December or in the beginning of January, probably in December;\r\n  indeed, I am very confident it was before I went home at Christmas.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Has any copy of this ever been printed?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ This is all there was of it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, except discussion; we discussed the matter.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I mean all there was committed to writing?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, all there was then committed to writing.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is it all there was as far as making out a contract is\r\n  concerned?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was this submitted to the producers as a body or individually?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We were very anxious to submit it to the producers, and I asked\r\n  them to appoint a committee that we might do it, but they had got up\r\n  such an excitement at the time that nothing was practicable.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When was that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Before the last of these contracts was signed.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Can you give the dates at all?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I cannot give the dates, but the contract with the Lake Shore\r\n  road had not been signed at the time.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What producers did you ask to call a meeting?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Among others I addressed a communication to be delivered to a\r\n  gentleman who was understood to be the chairman of a meeting about\r\n  to be held.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What was his name?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Foster W. Mitchell, of Franklin.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You addressed a communication to him, of what purport?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Asking him to appoint a committee to meet a committee of the\r\n  South Improvement Company, that they might know what the objects of\r\n  the South Improvement Company were. I proposed to submit these\r\n  contracts with the railroad companies to that committee and also the\r\n  form of contract which the railroad companies required the South\r\n  Improvement Company to enter into with the producers, before these\r\n  contracts went into effect.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you a copy of that communication or letter?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was a telegram.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you a copy of it here?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have not at present.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you it in your possession, anywhere, and can you lay it\r\n  before the committee?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I may have it; am not sure.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you receive a reply to that communication?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was it stated in your communication that you proposed to lay\r\n  before the committee the form of contract to be entered into with\r\n  the producers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir. I proposed to lay that before the committee if it\r\n  should be appointed.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If you are not able to furnish a copy of that communication I\r\n  will ask you to state orally its contents.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I could not give you the words of it; it was in general terms\r\n  asking that they appoint a committee to confer with a committee of\r\n  the South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ To confer in reference to what?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know that I should be safe in undertaking to say; I\r\n  know what my object was in writing it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That you have stated. If you received a reply from Mr.\r\n  Mitchell, state whether it was by letter or telegram.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I received a reply by telegraph from Mr. Mitchell, stating that\r\n  the meeting of the producers received the communication with\r\n  scorn—as of course they would if read to them, as a mass-meeting is\r\n  always called for a specific object.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That was not in his reply?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir, it was not. I replied to him that I had intended the\r\n  communication to him to be for the purpose of laying it before a few\r\n  of the principal producers; that to lay the proposition before the\r\n  meeting was of course to insure its defeat, because the meeting had\r\n  convened for a predetermined purpose, which was to denounce and\r\n  treat with scorn the South Improvement Company, because the South\r\n  Improvement Company had been represented to them as hostile to their\r\n  interests. This last perhaps was not in the communication.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you a copy of that paper which you addressed to Mr.\r\n  Mitchell?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I am not sure whether I have or not. It was a telegram.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did that substantially close the written communications between\r\n  you and the producers upon that subject?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir. I had a great many communications with individual\r\n  producers; I think with more than half the producers, estimating\r\n  them by the quality of oil produced.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ State what occurred.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have corresponded with them and in that correspondence they\r\n  have expressed their belief that the proposed plan of the South\r\n  Improvement Company would work greatly for the benefit of the\r\n  producing interest; that there was something greatly needed for the\r\n  producing interest, and that it could not thrive without something\r\n  of this kind, because it could not pay fair, living rates, for\r\n  transportation to the railroad companies at the price oil was\r\n  bringing, and that there was no likelihood of oil increasing in\r\n  price under the existing condition of things; that the railroad\r\n  could not always, of course, continue carrying at a loss.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will you give the names of the producers who proposed to join\r\n  the South Improvement Company, or who expressed themselves\r\n  favourable to the plan of that company, in addition to the name of\r\n  Mr. Mitchell?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I could give you the names of several of them, but I do not\r\n  think their lives and property would be safe. They requested me not\r\n  to mention their names because they thought it would be an imprudent\r\n  thing to do.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You refuse, then, to give the names which you say you could\r\n  state?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I refuse to give the names for the reason I have stated.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are there any of them you are willing to mention?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I will look over the letters and see whether there are any of\r\n  them not marked confidential. If there are any not so marked, I will\r\n  give you the names.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why do you state to this committee that you are not willing to\r\n  give the names of the parties to whom you refer, when you state that\r\n  a great many producers were in favour of this plan, and were\r\n  consulted in regard to it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I stated it because it was a fact.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Sheldon.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did the danger to the lives of these parties arise from the\r\n  excitement in the Oil Regions in consequence of these proceedings?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, one of the presidents of one of the committees\r\n  representing the producers was in New York, a Mr. Patterson. He\r\n  stated, as I understood, to one of the railroad officers, that he\r\n  did not think my life would be safe if I were to go into the Oil\r\n  Region, although he himself would not take it. I had received a\r\n  number of threatening letters, but I did not attach any importance\r\n  to them until Mr. Patterson made that statement.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What was the reason given why your life would not be safe?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know that the reason given, I think by Mr. Patterson,\r\n  that there was such an unreasonable excitement among the people as\r\n  to the nature and object of the South Improvement Company, which was\r\n  represented to them to be a measure altogether hostile to them.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you know what these misrepresentations were?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I only know by what I have seen stated in the papers and what\r\n  persons have mentioned to me.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you make an effort to correct the false impressions?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I did; the papers called for the other day by the committee,\r\n  and which I have here to-day to produce, will show that.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were your efforts to correct these misrepresentations\r\n  successful?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir, they were not. I will read the despatches which I sent\r\n  for the purpose of endeavouring to do that, and you will see from\r\n  them the nature of the efforts I made.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Sent to whom?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I sent a despatch to F. W. Mitchell through S. P. McCalmont of\r\n  Franklin, which I have here.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—We will not stop to read them.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—It will answer your question in a great deal shorter\r\n  period than I could answer it verbally.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—We will put the answers themselves in as testimony.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—Then I will read this as my answer, if you please,\r\n  because it expresses as fully as I could express the facts you\r\n  desire to know.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—Very well, you may hand the despatches to the\r\n  reporter, and they will go in as a part of your testimony, and save\r\n  the committee the time of reading them.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—You can hardly comprehend the answer without hearing the\r\n  despatches. There were three despatches, showing the efforts I made\r\n  to have the producers understand that the whole arrangement was one\r\n  which looked as much to their interest as to any other.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—Very well, you may furnish them to the committee; we\r\n  will not stop to read them now.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—I then offer you first my despatch to S. P. McCalmont,\r\n  dated New York, March 4, 1872. I next offer another despatch from\r\n  myself to F. W. Mitchell, dated New York, March 5, 1872, and also a\r\n  despatch from myself to the same party, dated New York, March 6,\r\n  1872.\r\n\r\n  The despatches referred to are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            NEW YORK, March 4, 1872.\r\n\r\n    S. P. MCCALMONT,\r\n          Franklin, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    Your telegram received. Please deliver the following\r\n    communication to F. W. Mitchell, or, in his absence, to somebody\r\n    else who will make its contents known to the principal producers\r\n    attending the meeting to be held to-morrow at Franklin:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To F. W. MITCHELL:\r\n\r\n  Yesterday I received by mail from you or some other friend in\r\n  Franklin several newspaper slips, one of which threatened the\r\n  destruction of my oil at Franklin. At the same time I received an\r\n  anonymous letter threatening injury to the Jamestown and Franklin\r\n  Railroad. Disapproval of my connection with the South Improvement\r\n  Company is alleged as the reason of both threats. This morning the\r\n  telegraph informs me that the threat to destroy my oil has been\r\n  executed by tapping the tank and letting it run to waste. While\r\n  there may be some excuse for working up the present excitement to\r\n  induce people to subscribe their money to new railroad schemes,\r\n  there can be nothing but reprobation for the lawless destruction of\r\n  property. You have sufficient character and influence, and\r\n  sufficient information of the purposes of the company, to quell this\r\n  excitement by a word, and I think it your duty to say that word. It\r\n  seems to me that a great responsibility rests with somebody among\r\n  you for stimulating the present causeless excitement, and the\r\n  lawless destruction of property. On meeting you here on your return\r\n  from the South, I explained to you, very briefly, that the whole\r\n  plan of the South Improvement Company was founded upon the\r\n  expectation of co-operation with the oil producers to maintain a\r\n  good price for crude oil, as the only means of securing a fair\r\n  remuneration to either the transporter, the refiner, or the\r\n  merchant.\r\n\r\n  Unless the producers will co-operate with us, first, by limiting the\r\n  production or the capacity of the markets of the world to absorb\r\n  petroleum at a good price; and, secondly, by tanking a large part of\r\n  the production for the next two or three months, that it may be\r\n  withheld from the market until the present glut is exhausted and\r\n  production reduced, it will be impossible, I am convinced from\r\n  recent advices of the state of supply and demand in the principal\r\n  markets of the world, to keep the price of crude oil up to $3.50,\r\n  and of refined oil up to twenty-two cents, during the coming summer.\r\n\r\n  I stated to you in the strongest terms the desire of the South\r\n  Improvement Company to enter into an arrangement for a series of\r\n  years with the producers, whereby good prices for crude oil at the\r\n  wells and fair and reasonable rates of transportation would at all\r\n  times be assured. The desire still exists. You expressed to me your\r\n  concurrence in these views, as others among the leading producers\r\n  whom I have more recently seen have also done.\r\n\r\n  I then explained to you certain important business which I had\r\n  postponed to await the organisation of the South Improvement\r\n  Company. That business I have been engaged upon for the last ten\r\n  days. As soon as I get through with it, which I hope will be in a\r\n  few days, I should like to meet a committee of the principal\r\n  producers to arrange the details of the plan of co-operation of\r\n  which we spoke. I therefore request you to have such a committee\r\n  appointed by the meeting noticed for to-morrow on the newspaper slip\r\n  sent to me, and if possible have a plan prepared by which, among\r\n  other things, we could extend to you large facilities of tankage and\r\n  capital to take care of the surplus oil until the present production\r\n  can be checked.\r\n\r\n                                                         P. H. WATSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              NEW YORK, March 5, 1872.\r\n\r\n  To F. W. MITCHELL,\r\n  Franklin, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  Just received another batch of newspaper slips giving proceedings of\r\n  Oil City meeting.\r\n\r\n  The meeting acted in ignorance and under a radical misconception of\r\n  the actual facts, and with far more earnestness and zeal than\r\n  judgment.\r\n\r\n  If you will take the trouble to appoint a committee of producers to\r\n  investigate, we will show that the contracts with the railroads are\r\n  as favourable to the producing as to any other interests; that the\r\n  much-denounced rebate will enhance the price of oil at the wells,\r\n  and that our entire plan in operation and effect will promote every\r\n  legitimate American interest in the oil trade.\r\n\r\n  You patiently test a well before deciding upon its merits, like\r\n  rational men. You examine other subjects before acting upon them. Is\r\n  not this a subject of sufficient importance to be worthy of rational\r\n  investigation?\r\n\r\n                                                         P. H. WATSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              NEW YORK, March 6, 1872.\r\n\r\n  To F. W. MITCHELL,\r\n  Franklin, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  Your telegrams received.\r\n\r\n  My telegrams were not addressed to the mass-meeting, but to you as a\r\n  friend, as is also this, to be read at your discretion to some of\r\n  the principal producers attending the meeting, simply to induce them\r\n  to investigate the subject about which they are excited before\r\n  acting upon it.\r\n\r\n  A mass-meeting is not a deliberative body; it always acts under the\r\n  feeling of impulse or passions, and meets for predetermined\r\n  purposes, one of which in this case, as appears in the articles of\r\n  the newspapers calling the meeting, was to denounce and show its\r\n  scorn for anything and everything connected with the South\r\n  Improvement Company. Hence it required no prophet to tell beforehand\r\n  in what spirit my telegrams to you would be listened to. You ask me\r\n  to go to Franklin to consult my true friends. I will most gladly\r\n  meet you and your friends at any place favourable to calm\r\n  investigation and deliberation, and therefore outside of the\r\n  atmosphere of excitement by which you are surrounded, say at Albany\r\n  or New York.\r\n\r\n  I can well understand that, however, the excited people of your\r\n  region may misjudge, they have no other purpose than to promote the\r\n  public interest, and knowing that you deservedly enjoy their\r\n  confidence, I am strongly convinced that a free and frank\r\n  interchange of views at the conference suggested would result in\r\n  satisfying you and the people that there exists no cause for\r\n  regarding us as enemies. I therefore hope you will name an early day\r\n  for the meeting.\r\n\r\n                                                         P. H. WATSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mr. Gilfillan.\r\n\r\n  I would like to suggest a question that would throw a little light\r\n  upon this subject, and which I know Mr. Watson will be entirely\r\n  satisfied to answer. I wish the chairman would ask if the objects of\r\n  the South Improvement Company, in connection with railroads, were\r\n  presented to the public through any statement in writing or by\r\n  telegraph to the public, explaining the objects.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—I am coming to that, but first I want to know of the\r\n  witness, whether he received any replies to these despatches?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, to one of them.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you a copy of that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have not, but I have stated the purport of the answer. To the\r\n  first I did not receive any answer; there was not time to receive\r\n  any, and I did not expect it. I sent the second shortly after, and\r\n  the answer was to the first and second together. To the third I\r\n  received no telegraphic answer.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You say you have no copy of these answers you received?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have not. I gave the purport of the answer I received at the\r\n  last meeting.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were there any other letters or statements published by your\r\n  authority to the public or to parties in interest among the\r\n  producers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ These were not published by my authority.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was there any other matter published by your authority, giving\r\n  explanation to the people?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I made similar statements to a great many of the producers.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I mean documentary evidence; was there anything published over\r\n  your signature?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Oh, I did not publish any document at all; I did not publish\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you authorise it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I neither published it nor authorised it, because I considered\r\n  it useless; the people were so excited that they could not be\r\n  reasoned with at all. Every one who informed me about it said so.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you offer to any of the producers, or any parties in\r\n  interest to show them these contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, I wanted that committee appointed for that purpose; I told\r\n  them so substantially in my despatch.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you make the offer otherwise?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I told them that I would, if that can be considered as an\r\n  offer. I said I would, and I should have done it if they had come to\r\n  meet us; but they were afraid.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Would you have published it, do you mean?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I should have been perfectly willing to publish the contract; I\r\n  should have been glad to have published everything in connection\r\n  with the matter.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If you would have been glad to have published it, why did you\r\n  not? You had the power.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I would have been very glad to have done it, with the assent of\r\n  these men.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ With the assent of what men?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The producers. I said to some of the producers that if they\r\n  would go and examine the whole plan, and after they had examined\r\n  into it they were not satisfied that it was for their interest, I\r\n  would be perfectly willing to abandon the whole thing. That was the\r\n  feeling we had in regard to the matter.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What producers did you say that to?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Several of them.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mention their names.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Men with whom I had been in correspondence with on this\r\n  subject, and whose lives and property I believe would not be safe if\r\n  I were to mention their names, because they have told me so. I have\r\n  promised not to expose them, and I feel in honour bound not to give\r\n  their names.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You have so promised in regard to all of them?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Most of those with whom I have had correspondence.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was there any opportunity offered to explain this matter, to\r\n  show the contracts and let them know what were the objects of your\r\n  company? Are there no names you can mention in that connection?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I shall have to look over the letters in order to see if there\r\n  are any not marked confidential. I should like to give you the names\r\n  if I am at liberty to do so.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Gilfillan.\r\n\r\n  I should like to make a suggestion which would throw a little light\r\n  on this subject. If the chairman will allow me, I will ask the\r\n  witness if he saw the proceedings of the meeting at Franklin, to\r\n  which he refers, and if so, whether a resolution was not passed at\r\n  that meeting asking for the production of these contracts that the\r\n  public might know what the objects of this company were?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have seen no such resolution; I do not think I have seen the\r\n  published proceedings of that meeting; I only saw such parts as were\r\n  sent to me in slips. There was certainly no such resolution as that\r\n  which came to me. Mr. Mitchell telegraphed to me that my telegrams\r\n  were received with scorn; that they did not want to know anything\r\n  about the matter.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you remember whether, about the first of March, the railroad\r\n  companies, with which you made these contracts, or some of them,\r\n  raised their rates of transportation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think about that time they did.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was it for a short time raised to that amount, and a printed\r\n  schedule published?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I never saw the published schedule; I understood that through a\r\n  mistake between William Vanderbilt, vice-president of the New York\r\n  Central Railroad Company and freight agent of the Lake Shore road,\r\n  it was supposed by the freight agent of the Lake Shore road that the\r\n  rate had been raised by an agreement among the railroads to the\r\n  maximum rates mentioned in their contracts with the South\r\n  Improvement Company. A day or two after that mistake, being in Mr.\r\n  Vanderbilt’s office, a telegram came in respect to it, and Mr.\r\n  Vanderbilt at once directed the correction to be made. Mr. Devereux,\r\n  the general manager of the Lake Shore Railroad, happened to come in\r\n  at the time, and he also gave directions to the officers of his road\r\n  to have the correction promptly made.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were you present?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, I was present. When I said “being in Mr. Vanderbilt’s\r\n  office,” I meant that I myself was present.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was the correction made at your instance, or request, or\r\n  suggestion?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was not.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why was it made?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Because it was a mistake, a misapprehension, a\r\n  misunderstanding, as I understood. I had not heard anything of it\r\n  before that moment, and it was accidental, as I said, that I heard\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then the rates were raised by the freight agents of the roads\r\n  to correspond with the rates mentioned in these contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know the facts any further than having heard it as I\r\n  have stated.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And you think they were raised to correspond with these\r\n  contracts by mistake?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I stated I so understood at the time.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You stated the circumstances so minutely as to its being a\r\n  mistake between Mr. Vanderbilt and the Lake Shore agent, that I\r\n  inferred you knew the facts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I only know it was so represented at the time.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you take any part in that conversation by which the error\r\n  you speak of was corrected?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Only in this sense: Mr. Vanderbilt mentioned the fact to me\r\n  that a mistake of that kind had been made, that he had just received\r\n  a despatch in relation to it, and he was about to correct it, and he\r\n  asked me, I think, if I knew whether Mr. Devereux had given any\r\n  orders respecting the matter. I told him I did not know anything\r\n  about it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If I understand you, the time had not come for raising the\r\n  freights under these contracts then?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know anything about the time; I did not intend to make\r\n  any such statement.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ At that time, as president of the South Improvement Company,\r\n  was it not the understanding, and was it not your expectation, that\r\n  the rates would go up at that time as they did go up to the maximum\r\n  rates named in these contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know that as president I had any knowledge of the\r\n  matter; and as an individual I took no part in the transaction.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The president is an officer supposed to know more about such\r\n  details than any of the directors or members of the company; and as\r\n  president of that company I ask you if it was not the general\r\n  understanding that the rates would go up about that time?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I answer distinctly that it was not, and that as president of\r\n  that company I had nothing to do with the rates then, because the\r\n  South Improvement Company’s contracts had not gone into operation,\r\n  and neither the South Improvement Company nor any of its officers\r\n  had any control of the question in any way.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Had not the contracts at that time been signed?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The contracts had been signed, but they were held by me\r\n  personally in escrow and they had not gone into effect.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ They had been signed?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, but had not gone into effect.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were not these contracts so signed and held by you as president\r\n  of the South Improvement Company, and did you not expect that the\r\n  rates would advance to the maximum named therein at that time?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Certainly I did not; and in regard to the premises stated in\r\n  the first part of your question I do not want to admit the\r\n  statements you made. I do not suppose the object was to entrap me\r\n  into an admission of a statement that is not true.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Hambleton._—I do not wish to entrap you into anything.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—I say that when you remark that I hold these contracts as\r\n  president of the South Improvement Company, you mistake; they were\r\n  not in my hands as president.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I supposed that as president they passed into your hands?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They were passed into my hands as a person, and as such, in\r\n  execution of the trust, I should hold them as much against the South\r\n  Improvement Company as against anybody else.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You answer my question then that you did not expect them to\r\n  raise these rates?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Certainly I did not; I had no such idea at all.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ State how that mistake, or misunderstanding, or error, happened\r\n  to occur, and what was the cause of it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I really do not know; it was suggested at the time by Mr.\r\n  Devereux that Mr. Hills, the freight agent of the Lake Shore\r\n  Railroad, had a son on his death-bed, that he had to leave the\r\n  office in charge of subordinates, and that he had not his wits about\r\n  him as usual, because his mind was so pre-occupied with the sickness\r\n  of his son, who was a favourite son.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If he had not his wits about him, had he the contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not wish to use that expression in any offensive sense; I\r\n  mean he had not the full use of his mind. I do not know whether he\r\n  had the contracts or not. I think it is probable from the\r\n  conversation there that all the freight agents had the rates\r\n  mentioned in these contracts; I have no doubt that the officers of\r\n  the roads had consulted him; indeed some of them stated that they\r\n  had been consulted, and that the freight agents knew what rates were\r\n  provided for in these contracts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I want an answer to my question. By your contracts with the\r\n  railroad companies you were to purchase all the refineries in the\r\n  main cities of this country. You had it in your power to furnish\r\n  more transportation than anybody else?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The refineries were not purchased; they have not been\r\n  purchased.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was not that contemplated?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The company contemplated purchasing if it had gone into\r\n  operation.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I am getting at the point now; if your scheme had been\r\n  successful do you suppose anybody in the world could have furnished\r\n  an equal amount of transportation with your company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If our plan had been carried out it included everybody; there\r\n  would have been nobody left, and no hostile interest.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You would have had the matter perfectly under your control?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, because there would have been nobody left.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then I am correct in saying that nobody else could have shipped\r\n  oil under any circumstances, because you were to have an additional\r\n  rebate in case any rebate was allowed to any other person?\r\n\r\n  _A._ But if all interest was drawn into the plan, there would have\r\n  been no hostile party and no injustice done to anybody.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That is a different matter; now we agree that your advantages\r\n  of rebate from the leading roads gave you the power of paying larger\r\n  prices to the oil producers than anybody else?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was expected that these rebates would enable the refiners\r\n  and producers to maintain a fair price for crude oil at the wells.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Will you answer my question? Could you not have purchased oil\r\n  and shipped it with these rebates, on terms that nobody else could\r\n  compete with?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If everything had been successful, if the South Improvement\r\n  Company had gone into successful operation, combining all these\r\n  various interests, of course we could have paid a higher price than\r\n  anybody else.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you not see then that you had the producers of the Oil\r\n  Regions absolutely in your control?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Sheldon._—I do.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—I do not, and will tell you why; you asked me a question\r\n  that is a good deal like attempting to make the Bible prove that it\r\n  says itself “that there is no God.”\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—All our time is being expended in this way. Will you\r\n  answer the direct question put to you?\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—I want to answer it truly. It is an essential part of\r\n  this contract that the producers should be joined in it; therefore\r\n  it was not hostile to the producers in any of its intents or\r\n  purposes; it never would have gone into effect unless the producers\r\n  had joined.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Sheldon.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That may be the fact, but if the producers had refused to join,\r\n  could you not have forced them into the arrangement on your own\r\n  terms?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; because the South Improvement Company had no contract.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You have a contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; it has no contract.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did it never have?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; they are placed in escrow with me. It has never had\r\n  any, that is, there is not to-day and has not at any time been a\r\n  contract in existence, in activity, or in force between the\r\n  railroads and the South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is not that entirely due to the excitement produced in\r\n  consequence of the contracts having been entered into?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If the purchasers had entered into the contract which was\r\n  contemplated by the South Improvement Company, it would have been\r\n  entirely satisfactory to all parties, and both contracts would have\r\n  gone into operation.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And if a party of the producers had joined, you could have\r\n  forced the balance to have gone into the arrangement?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Two-thirds were required.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You could have forced the balance to have gone in?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The majority rules in most kinds of business; unless two-thirds\r\n  had joined, no arrangement would have been made.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Let us see whether you have not power to force the producers;\r\n  by your contract with the railroads you had the advantage of forty\r\n  cents a barrel to Cleveland and Pittsburg, and $1.06 to New York,\r\n  Philadelphia, Baltimore or Boston on crude petroleum; while on\r\n  refined petroleum you had the advantage to these cities of fifty\r\n  cents a barrel, and from any other point to New York, Philadelphia,\r\n  Baltimore and Boston of thirty-two cents a barrel; it seems to me at\r\n  that advantage you could have compelled the producers to do exactly\r\n  what you wanted them to do?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The South Improvement Company never could have had that\r\n  advantage, because the condition on which the main contract with the\r\n  railroads was to be enforced was that the producers should join with\r\n  them and participate in the benefits.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is that embodied in the different contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The condition is not embodied upon the face of the contract; it\r\n  is a condition upon which I held the contracts.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now Mr. Watson, as a lawyer, if you are such, are verbal\r\n  conditions made with a third party to change the terms of a written\r\n  contract executed in all respects?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Let me give you an illustration within my experience that is\r\n  exactly parallel to this: I had a note executed, sealed, and\r\n  complete in every way, put into my possession to be delivered upon\r\n  the production of a deed.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—Wait a moment, there must be some kind of order in\r\n  this proceeding. I wish you to answer the question which has been\r\n  asked you, whether as a lawyer the conditions stated would change\r\n  the terms of a written contract. If you are able to give an answer\r\n  to that legal question you may do so.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—Let me hear the question and I will endeavour to answer\r\n  it fully, if you will allow me to answer it in my own way.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Sheldon.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The question is, whether a verbal understanding to be performed\r\n  by other parties not embraced in the written contract can be made\r\n  effective to modify the terms of that contract as between the\r\n  parties to it.\r\n\r\n  _A._ An agreement between the parties to a contract, whether verbal\r\n  or written, fixing the terms upon which the contract shall go into\r\n  effect, is perfectly competent and would be binding.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That is your opinion as a lawyer?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is my opinion.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, sir, these contracts contemplated a considerable increase\r\n  in the freight charges, both upon crude and refined petroleum?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They contemplate an increase almost up to the price for coal\r\n  and lumber, as they are ordinarily carried, amounting to about 1½\r\n  cents a pound.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did it contemplate an increase upon both crude petroleum and\r\n  refined oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Certainly; the railroads had been carrying these articles at a\r\n  loss of nearly a million dollars; they carried for less than cost,\r\n  and one object of these contracts was to increase the price of\r\n  freight to the railroads.\r\n\r\n  _The Chairman._—Let me suggest the propriety of first answering the\r\n  question and then giving your explanation. That is the regular\r\n  course, and I am sorry to say that during your whole examination\r\n  there has not been a direct answer given to a question.\r\n\r\n  _Witness._—Well, sir, where a question is such that it would give a\r\n  false impression unless answered fully and fairly, I do not want to\r\n  convey that false impression by my testimony.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Sheldon.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Very well, I am satisfied with your explanation; now could not\r\n  these railroad companies have raised the price of freight without\r\n  the intervention of the South Improvement Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There were a good many difficulties in the way.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Could they not have done it, and had they not the power to do\r\n  it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The laws of the State of New York forbid the Erie and New York\r\n  Central Railroads from combining to raise the rates of freight;\r\n  whether they could have done it I do not know. They tried very hard\r\n  to agree to raise the freights but did not succeed.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If that is the law of New York, is there an exception to that\r\n  law so that they could combine with the South Improvement Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think it was the opinion of lawyers that this arrangement was\r\n  perfectly legal and proper; they could not combine, but they could\r\n  make an independent agreement.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ They could raise the rates in your behalf, but they could not\r\n  in the behalf of anybody else?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not in behalf of anybody, but they could make this transaction.\r\n  For two or three years they had been cutting under for the purpose\r\n  of drawing the business away from each other.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What effect would this increase of freight have upon the\r\n  consumers of oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think it would not be to the prejudice of the consumers in\r\n  this country at all.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Would it not have increased the price?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think it would not have increased the price to the retail\r\n  consumers in this country. If there had been no countervailing\r\n  advantage to the retail consumers, of course it would have increased\r\n  the price.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You mean to say that there was such a margin upon the traffic\r\n  of oil that to increase the freight charges fifty or 100 per cent.\r\n  would not affect the retail price?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; I do not mean to say that is the reason.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is that not the effect of your answer?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir, I think not. My explanation of it is this: that the\r\n  oil trade, unless it is steadied by some artificial process, is\r\n  subject to violent and rapid fluctuation. The retailers are very\r\n  quick to note a rise in price, as I explained the other day, but\r\n  very slow to notice a fall, so that the average price of a retail\r\n  purchaser is very much above the average wholesale price. Now it was\r\n  expected that the price under this arrangement would be a steady\r\n  price, and that with a steady, regular price it would not cause the\r\n  retailer to raise the price at which he sold at all.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you know what profit is made on a barrel of oil sold by\r\n  retailers to consumers in Northern Ohio?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It varies.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Does it ever reach over $1.75 a barrel?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I can answer your question with a little calculation. (After\r\n  computation.) I have known it to be sold at as low a profit as forty\r\n  cents a barrel. About six or eight cents a gallon is a fair profit.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ We gentlemen are supposed to be acting for the public good;\r\n  will you tell us what public interest you are advancing, or thought\r\n  you were advancing in making the arrangements that are foreshadowed\r\n  in these contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We were advancing the interests of the railroads, the\r\n  transporting interest, the interest of the producers, those who mine\r\n  oil, the interest of the refiners, those who manufacture it, and the\r\n  interests of the American trade and business generally, for\r\n  five-sixths of the oil produced is exported, and an increase in the\r\n  price of crude oil at the mines is essential to the payment of a\r\n  fair business profit to the refiners; it is essential to the payment\r\n  of a fair rate of transportation, because without a higher price of\r\n  transportation more profit to the refiners could not be paid long\r\n  and allow the producer pay for his labour at the average price of\r\n  oil last year.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you not think the interests of trade in this country are\r\n  better promoted by leaving everybody to attend to their own matters\r\n  and protect their own rights rather than by forming a combination as\r\n  you did?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It is essential in many cases beyond individual means to form\r\n  combinations. Railroads cannot be built without the co-operation of\r\n  a great many individuals. There are a great many other operations\r\n  that cannot be managed successfully without co-operation, and this\r\n  is one of them.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did the producers ask you to go into this operation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The most intelligent producers did, and to-day, my judgment is,\r\n  that they are all satisfied that something of that kind is necessary\r\n  for the protection of American industry.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did the consumers ask you to go into it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not any considerable number of consumers; we ourselves are all\r\n  consumers. The body of them did not.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How much money would the railroad companies have made under\r\n  these contracts if they had shipped oil at these advanced rates?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They would have made about the same profits on that business\r\n  that they do on coal and lumber, even if the maximum rates had been\r\n  paid without any rebate; not so much if the net rates only had been\r\n  charged.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ State whether in your judgment it was necessary, in order to\r\n  make provision for these people for the South Improvement Company to\r\n  receive this million dollars a year for the benefit of American\r\n  interest, as you have suggested.\r\n\r\n  _A._ There was no such provision made, as I understand it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The testimony is that about six million barrels a year are\r\n  shipped; the provisions of this contract are that a rebate to that\r\n  company, supposing the maximum to have been charged, should be over\r\n  a dollar a barrel.\r\n\r\n  _A._ No such thing as charging maximum rates was ever contemplated.\r\n  The contract on its face says it is a cardinal principle that the\r\n  gross rates shall be kept as near the net rates as possible.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Suppose it had been kept at the gross rates, your company would\r\n  then have received over six million?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That would be altogether different from the principles on which\r\n  the contract was based.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If the gross rates which the contract allows had been paid,\r\n  however, the South Improvement Company would have received a rebate\r\n  of over six million dollars?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Certainly, supposing such an absurdity.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why did you put such an absurdity in the contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It is not in the contract, as I stated.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Hambleton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ It is in the contract as a maximum?\r\n\r\n  _A._ But it is also expressly stated that the rates shall be kept as\r\n  near to net rates as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 13 (See page 1093)\r\n                       CONTRACT OF MARCH 25, 1872\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From “A History of the Rise and Fall of the South Improvement\r\n  Company,” pages 27–28.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. That all arrangements for the transportation of oil after this\r\n  date shall be upon a basis of perfect equality to all shippers,\r\n  producers and refiners, and that no rebates, drawbacks, or other\r\n  arrangements of any character, shall be made or allowed that will\r\n  give any party the slightest difference in rates or discrimination\r\n  of any character whatever.\r\n\r\n  II. That the present rates from Oil City, Union, Corry, Irvineton,\r\n  Pittsburg, Cleveland and other competing points, shall be and remain\r\n  in full force at following rates:\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ON REFINED OIL, BENZINE, ETC.\r\n\r\n                                                            Per barrel\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Boston            $1.65\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to New York           1.50\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Philadelphia       1.35\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Baltimore          1.35\r\n  From Cleveland to Boston                                        1.65\r\n  From Cleveland to New York                                      1.50\r\n  From Cleveland to Philadelphia                                  1.35\r\n  From Cleveland to Baltimore                                     1.35\r\n  From Pittsburg to New York                                      1.50\r\n  From Pittsburg to Philadelphia                                  1.35\r\n  From Pittsburg to Baltimore                                     1.35\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ON CRUDE OIL\r\n\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Boston            $1.50\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to New York           1.35\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Philadelphia       1.20\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Baltimore          1.20\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Cleveland           .50\r\n  From Oil City, Union, Corry and Irvineton to Pittsburg           .50\r\n\r\n  And said rates shall not be liable to any change either for increase\r\n  or decrease without first giving to William Hasson, president of the\r\n  Producers’ Union at Oil City, at least ninety days’ notice in\r\n  writing of such contemplated change.\r\n\r\n  III. In the distribution of cars for shipments, it shall be done\r\n  without discrimination.\r\n\r\n  IV. On the basis as hereinbefore stated, the parties respectively\r\n  agree to carry out the arrangements in good faith and work for the\r\n  mutual interests of each other.\r\n\r\n  In witness whereof the parties have hereunto affixed their\r\n  signatures, this twenty-fifth day of March, A.D. 1872:\r\n\r\n  For the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad Company: H.

FLAGLER\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Before a committee appointed by the Legislature of Ohio, March,\r\n  1879.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Henry M. Flagler; residence, Cleveland, Ohio; occupation, secretary\r\n  Standard Oil Company; sworn and examined.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Norton.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Flagler, I suppose you understand that this investigation\r\n  is brought under what is known as House Resolution Number 162?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I understand that it is.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How long have you been secretary of the Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Since its organisation, some time in January, 1870.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Are the articles manufactured or the oil refined by your\r\n  company shipped over the line of any railroad in the State of Ohio,\r\n  and if so, state whether or not any rate of freight is contracted\r\n  for by you or whether your company pays the freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ To the first question, yes, sir; more or less of the product of\r\n  our refineries is shipped over the railroads of the state. As a rule\r\n  all of the freight contracts have been made by me.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Please state as near as you can what proportion of your product\r\n  is shipped out of the state?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I should say from sixty-five to seventy per cent.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, has your corporation any contracts, written or verbal,\r\n  with any of the railroads of the State of Ohio for carrying your\r\n  freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You may state whether these contracts are written or verbal.\r\n\r\n  _A._ They are written.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you heretofore, prior to this time, any contracts written\r\n  or verbal?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We have.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You may state, Mr. Flagler, whether by virtue of these\r\n  contracts it has been agreed or allowed by the railroad companies to\r\n  pay you any drawbacks or rebates on freights.\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir, it has not.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You may state whether or not you are allowed special rates, or\r\n  what is known as special privileges.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I can’t answer that question from the fact that I do not know\r\n  what other people get, so I do not know whether they are special\r\n  rates or general.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I believe, Mr. Flagler, that in your subpœna it was requested\r\n  of you that if any such contracts were in existence relative to\r\n  freight matters, you would bring them before the committee. Did you\r\n  do so?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have never seen the subpœna, so I do not know what the demand\r\n  was. I have, however, contracts made with our company as far back as\r\n  the first one ever made.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Can you produce these contracts before this committee?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, I can; I am willing to do so, provided they may be\r\n  used by the committee—if it is proper to ask, to be used in the\r\n  nature of a confidential communication. None of these contracts\r\n  provides for any discrimination whatever, but they may contain some\r\n  business secret of the Standard Oil Company, whose interests I am\r\n  bound to protect. I do not see how the submission of those contracts\r\n  as evidence in this case will do other than bear out the statement I\r\n  have made under oath. I do not see how they will do anything more\r\n  than sustain the statements I have made. I would be very glad to\r\n  have our company set right before the public in these matters, but I\r\n  do not care enough about it, however, to have our business contracts\r\n  made public. I should be very glad to submit them to you under such\r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Flagler, do you know anything about the rates of freight\r\n  from the Southern portions of the state, well, say from Marietta and\r\n  from Wheeling to the City of Columbus?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you have anything to do, or has the Standard Oil Company\r\n  anything to do with the making of the rates of freight for the\r\n  company known as the Camden Consolidated?\r\n\r\n  _A._ None whatever.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you anything to do with the making of the rate, or the\r\n  arranging of the freights for the company known as the Marietta Oil\r\n  Refining Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ None whatever.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Testimony introduced here shows, I think, Mr. Flagler, that\r\n  about one year ago the rates of freight were raised nearly one-half\r\n  from the points I have mentioned and from Parkersburg and other\r\n  places to points in this direction. Had the Standard Oil Company any\r\n  understanding by and between the railroad companies in regard to\r\n  this rise in the rates of freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I should say, to my own knowledge, positively no; I never heard\r\n  of it before. I do not know what the rates were and I did not know\r\n  that the raise had been made.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you in your capacity, or does the Standard Oil Company\r\n  through its agents, control the rates of freight or make the rates\r\n  of any of the oil companies in Cleveland, outside of your own\r\n  corporation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Flagler, what is your rate of freight from the seaboard, or\r\n  to the seaboard from Cleveland?\r\n\r\n  _A._ At the present time?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Yes, sir, at the present time.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Do you mean per carload or by the barrel?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Well, we’ll put it by the barrel, as there is some testimony\r\n  before the committee relating to that.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not know that I could answer the question and I do not\r\n  know but that I would be betraying the business interests of other\r\n  people. The custom for several years, in fact, for more than five\r\n  years, has been that the rates of freight on shipments to the\r\n  seaboard and export oil have been made by what is called trunk\r\n  lines, the New York Central, the Erie, now New York, Lake Erie and\r\n  Western, the Pennsylvania, and Baltimore and Ohio. The general\r\n  freight agents are the officers who make those rates, and their\r\n  Western connections share in them. I do not know how the freight\r\n  which is paid for services rendered is divided between their Western\r\n  connections, having no means of knowing that at all. We do not make\r\n  any contracts with the Lake Shore for the rates of freight, and the\r\n  same is equally true of the Atlantic and Great Western. These are\r\n  the only two roads we ever ship by—I may be wrong; we ship some by\r\n  way of Pittsburg, over the Cleveland and Pittsburg or over the\r\n  Baltimore and Ohio.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you know what the open rate, the published rate is to the\r\n  seaboard by the barrel?\r\n\r\n  _A._ To Boston and New York, $1.54½; to Philadelphia and Baltimore,\r\n  $1.29½.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, Mr. Flagler, you have used your pencil to arrive at that\r\n  conclusion, why was it necessary to figure out that matter if there\r\n  is a published rate?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Simply because I do not keep that thing in my mind and had to\r\n  call upon my memory for the way the thing is got at. I got at that\r\n  by deducting what is called the crude rebate. Nobody pays the crude\r\n  rebate which is 45½ cents. Whether that form is kept up by the\r\n  railroad companies I do not know, but my impression is it is not.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ It is a fact, isn’t it, that you do get a lower rate and pay\r\n  less freight than the published rate? I believe it is in evidence\r\n  that the open rate of freight to the seaboard will average about\r\n  $1.65.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have never seen the freight tariff, if you mean that which is\r\n  known as the schedule rate published for the public. I have not seen\r\n  anything of the kind and do not know anything about it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What inducement does your company offer to the railroads or\r\n  what propositions are made by the railroads to your company? Now, I\r\n  refer to the testimony given by Mr. Hills in regard to the carrying\r\n  of oils, etc., what inducements do the railroad companies give\r\n  whereby they lower your rate of freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They do not give us lower rates of freight for any\r\n  consideration of that kind. They pay us for the use of our property,\r\n  if we furnish them with terminal facilities, cars in which to haul\r\n  the goods, they pay us a compensation for the use of the property.\r\n  Perhaps I can give it so you can understand it; we keep a separate\r\n  account with each refinery and if we spend $50,000, or $100,000 to\r\n  create what we term terminal facilities, warehouses, loading places,\r\n  etc., we make an arrangement whereby they pay us a fair compensation\r\n  for the property that is created by our money. That consideration is\r\n  credited to that investment and has nothing whatever to do with the\r\n  freight. The refinery making the oil is charged with the rate of\r\n  freight just as anybody else pays, and the compensation for the use\r\n  of tank cars and terminal facilities at the shipping and receiving\r\n  ends of the line is given for the use of these ends. I will say that\r\n  in the contracts we have made, the railroad companies have expressly\r\n  reserved the right to give to other parties the same privileges if\r\n  they furnish the same conveniences.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Does the Standard Oil Company own and control the Camden\r\n  Consolidated Company at Parkersburg?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I would like to ask a question in reply, and that is,\r\n  whether that question and answer comes within the scope of this\r\n  resolution?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I will give you my reason for asking the question. It has been\r\n  charged here by witnesses that there is a collusion by and between\r\n  the railroads in the Southern part of the state and the Camden\r\n  Consolidated Oil Company or the Standard Oil Company, as they term\r\n  it, for discriminations in the rates of freight. Now, to find out\r\n  whether or not there is anything for which to blame the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, I ask this question.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, it is a business secret of our company, but considering\r\n  the circumstance, I will answer the question. The Standard Oil\r\n  Company doesn’t own or control the Camden Oil Company, and I would\r\n  say to every man explicitly and fully that the Standard Oil Company\r\n  doesn’t own a share of stock in the Camden Consolidated Company. I\r\n  say this so I may be understood and I hope I have done so. I do not\r\n  own a share in it myself.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Coming back to this question of the contracts, have you any of\r\n  the written contracts that have been or are now in force, that you\r\n  can give this committee; contracts between the railroad companies\r\n  traversing this state and your company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir. (Contracts produced.) The price for the shipment of\r\n  oil per barrel as given in the first contract for the year 1870 was\r\n  as follows: From the first of February to the first of June, 1870,\r\n  $1.40; from the first of June to the first of November, 1870, $1.20;\r\n  this was during the season of navigation. From the first of November\r\n  until the expiration of the contract, April 1, $1.60.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is there a line or clause in that contract whereby there is an\r\n  agreement for rebates or drawbacks?\r\n\r\n  _A._ None whatever.\r\n\r\n  Second contract read: In this contract the rates were as follows:\r\n  From the first of April until the middle of November, 1872, about\r\n  seven months, $1.25. For the remainder of November, December,\r\n  January, February and March of 1873, $1.40. These were rates per\r\n  barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were there no rebates, drawbacks, or special privileges given\r\n  outside of what is written in the contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ None whatever. (Third contract introduced.)\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Flagler_: I want to say something of this matter and I want to\r\n  tell the whole truth. Our business was at the time about 4,000\r\n  barrels a day and we had contracted this oil for delivery at once,\r\n  and we had to pay from $50 to $150 gold per day if we kept it an\r\n  hour longer than the time specified in the contract, so it was very\r\n  important for us that the railroads put these on board as rapidly as\r\n  possible.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Flagler, from the reading of that contract I see that you\r\n  might, instead of being benefited, sustain damages by the failure on\r\n  the part of the railroad company to get your oil in there. Did you\r\n  ever have to pay any demurrage to them?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir, we had to pay some years as high as $30,000.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you ever received any benefits by reason of these\r\n  contracts that any other shipper might not have received?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir. Not in the slightest. All the way through these\r\n  contracts you will observe that we have undertaken those risks which\r\n  the law imposes on the common carrier and which no railroad can\r\n  divest itself of except by written agreement. The handling of these\r\n  quantities of oil was a very serious matter; there was a constant\r\n  tendency on the part of the railroad companies to put cars used in\r\n  this trade to some other purpose, whenever it would pay them better.\r\n  They used a rack car, such as they could carry cattle in and we have\r\n  had a great deal of trouble with these roads in the use of those\r\n  cars, because if they could get cattle to haul from Chicago to St.\r\n  Louis for something more than they were getting from us they would\r\n  do it. I want to say what the facts are under the contract just\r\n  read. You will remember that during seven months of the year we were\r\n  to give them 4,000 barrels of oil per day or 100,000 barrels a\r\n  month, and the smallest of the shipments in those months was\r\n  108,000. We gave them during the rest of the time more oil and paid\r\n  them the contract on it when we could have shipped by canal for\r\n  forty cents less. On the first day of December, a competing line of\r\n  railway lowered the rate to $1.05 per barrel. I went to Mr.\r\n  Vanderbilt and told him that the rate should be maintained at the\r\n  agreed price or else we would not have made the contract with him. I\r\n  said to Mr. Vanderbilt that if he insisted in the fulfillment of the\r\n  contract basis and exacted the payment of the contract price, it\r\n  would result in our being compelled to close our refineries, for we\r\n  could not afford to pay $1.25, when other people were only paying\r\n  $1.05. I called his attention to the fact that during the season of\r\n  canal navigation we had given the maximum shipments of oil, 180,000\r\n  barrels a month, and some in excess of it, and paid $1.25. I said,\r\n  if you will reduce these rates to the rate made by the Pennsylvania\r\n  Company, in my judgment thirty days will not elapse before they will\r\n  be willing to restore their rates, and all we ask is to be put on a\r\n  parity with other shippers. After a moment’s hesitation he asked if\r\n  I thought he ought to stand all of this twenty cents. I told him if\r\n  he should stand any part of it he should stand it all. I said, it is\r\n  a transportation fight and not a fight of the manufacturers. When it\r\n  comes to competition of the manufacturers we would take care of\r\n  ourselves. I said that we would not have made this contract except\r\n  on their assurance that the contract price of $1.25 was to be\r\n  maintained. He said: “I will make your rate $1.05,” and this was\r\n  after we had done more than we had agreed to do under the contract.\r\n  The next day we sold between 50,000 and 60,000 on the basis of $1.05\r\n  per barrel. Mr. Vanderbilt allowed that rate of payment for one\r\n  month and then said he would exact the contract price, $1.25. I said\r\n  all right, and we shall ship just the amount of oil we are compelled\r\n  to ship to fulfill our contract and then we shall stop. We paid him\r\n  $1.25 for all over the month and then we did not run a barrel of oil\r\n  from the City of Cleveland more than that until the expiration of\r\n  this contract for three months. That is the good that the contract\r\n  worked on us. You might consider it a baby act to plead the equities\r\n  of the case, but we could not place our oil on the market and\r\n  compete with other refineries.\r\n\r\n  (Fourth contract introduced.)\r\n\r\n  _Q._ This is the only contract you have now in existence whereby you\r\n  carry your freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you know anything of the suits brought by Teagle and Company\r\n  against the Lake Shore road for discriminations in freight?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Nothing whatever.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Have you had since the organisation of your company any\r\n  understanding outside of these contracts whereby discriminations are\r\n  made in favour of your company as against any of the smaller\r\n  refineries of the state?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Has your company or corporation in conjunction with the\r\n  railroads ever operated so to “squeeze out” as they term it, or\r\n  injure any other refining company of the state, outside of the\r\n  Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir, never. I would like to enlarge upon that question. I\r\n  suppose it would be fair to the mind of every member of this\r\n  committee present. A very large business with other mechanical\r\n  contrivances and an experience which grows up with and comes along\r\n  with business and always doing a very large business, in the nature\r\n  and order of things should make its presence felt by the parties\r\n  doing a comparatively small business. In 1873 and 1874, when we\r\n  stipulated for those 4,000 per day, if anybody has followed the\r\n  progress of the Standard Oil Company they would know and I feel\r\n  justified in saying that we have done a very large business, and\r\n  aimed to do it with economy and give the purchaser the very best oil\r\n  manufactured, consistent with a good and safe kind of oil—to\r\n  manufacture at one point under the eye of one man. With an\r\n  aggregation of capital and a business experience, and hold upon the\r\n  channels of trade such as we have, it is idle to say that the small\r\n  manufacturer can compete with us, and, although it is an offensive\r\n  term, “squeezing out,” yet it has never been done by the conjunction\r\n  of any railroads with us or by the carrying out of freights.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 15 (See page 1106)\r\n                           THE PITTSBURG PLAN\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From the Oil City Derrick, May 17, 1872.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Refiners to lease to the company for five years their\r\n  superstructure with sufficient real estate to carry on the business\r\n  of the works.\r\n\r\n  2. That the rental be eight per cent. per annum on the appraised\r\n  value of the superstructure, and the company to assume all risks and\r\n  pay all ordinary taxes.\r\n\r\n  3. Lessors to pay into the treasury of the company for a working\r\n  capital one-half of the appraised value of the superstructure in\r\n  cash or the equivalent in refiner’s stock.\r\n\r\n  4. Said lessors to receive for money paid in as above the bonds of\r\n  the company, in amount equal to cash paid in, and stocks of the\r\n  company for an equal amount; said bonds payable in five years or at\r\n  the option of the company after one year, said bonds to be\r\n  denominational coupon bonds to bear interest at the rate of eight\r\n  per cent. per annum, payable semi-annually.\r\n\r\n  5. The company shall not pay annually more than ten per cent. on the\r\n  stock as dividends until the said bonds are redeemed.\r\n\r\n  6. After the bonds are paid, then the company shall have the right\r\n  and shall be obliged to purchase all said superstructure at the full\r\n  appraised value first made, and shall give in exchange for the same\r\n  stock of the company for the full amount.\r\n\r\n  7. Each district shall appoint a local committee of three persons to\r\n  make appraisals, and when any appraisements are being made, the\r\n  chairman of each local committee shall be required to be present to\r\n  take part in the appraisement.\r\n\r\n  There shall be a board of appeal which shall be composed of the\r\n  chairman of each local committee. All presidents of the company\r\n  shall be presidents ex officio of the board.\r\n\r\n  The committee shall place a cash valuation on the superstructure and\r\n  shall be instructed as to the manner in which the valuation shall be\r\n  obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 16 (See page 1117)\r\n                              “THE AGENCY”\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From the Oil City Derrick.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. There shall be established, under the auspices of the Council of\r\n  the Petroleum Producers’ Association of Pennsylvania, an\r\n  organisation under sanction of the laws of Pennsylvania, which shall\r\n  be known as “THE PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ AGENCY.”\r\n\r\n  II. The capital stock shall be not less than one million dollars,\r\n  and shall be divided into shares of one hundred dollars each, which\r\n  shall be subscribed only by members of the Petroleum Producers’\r\n  Association, or by such other persons as may be approved by the\r\n  Council.\r\n\r\n  III. No transfers of the shares of the capital stock shall be made\r\n  on the books of the Agency, except upon such conditions as the\r\n  directors may prescribe, subject to the approval of the Council.\r\n\r\n  IV. The business of the Agency shall be managed by a board of\r\n  thirteen directors, who shall be elected annually by the\r\n  stockholders.\r\n\r\n  V. There shall be an advisory board to consist of one member elected\r\n  by each local association and approved by the Council. The members\r\n  of the advisory board shall be admitted to the meetings of the board\r\n  of directors and shall be entitled to all the privileges of\r\n  directors, except that of voting. Any member of the advisory board\r\n  may be removed for any abuse of his trust, or for official\r\n  misconduct, by a vote of three-fourths of the Council at a regular\r\n  meeting.\r\n\r\n  VI. The local associations may appoint committees to solicit and\r\n  receive subscriptions to the capital stock; they may also appoint\r\n  responsible trustees to receive payments on account of such\r\n  subscriptions, to whom the subscribers shall pay at least ten per\r\n  cent. upon their subscriptions at the time of subscribing. The\r\n  committees of the local associations shall advise the president of\r\n  the Council, from day to day, of the amount of subscriptions\r\n  received by them, and whenever the sum of at least one million\r\n  dollars shall have been subscribed in good faith, and approved by\r\n  the Council, and the organisation of the Agency legally completed,\r\n  subscribers shall be notified to hold an election of directors. The\r\n  directors shall, as soon as practicable after their election,\r\n  proceed to elect a president, secretary and treasurer. The trustees,\r\n  appointed by the local associations to receive subscriptions, shall\r\n  thereupon be required to pay over to the Agency the amounts received\r\n  by them on account of subscriptions to the capital stock. The Agency\r\n  shall not be responsible for any subscriptions paid to the trustees\r\n  appointed by the local associations until the same shall have been\r\n  paid over to the Agency or its authorised representatives.\r\n\r\n  Subscriptions to the capital stock may be received, payable in oil\r\n  at five dollars per barrel, delivered on the cars or in the tanks of\r\n  the Agency at any sub-agency on the line of the railways; provided,\r\n  however, that no certificate of stock shall be issued in any case in\r\n  which payment is made in pipe-line receipts until the oil shall have\r\n  actually been received upon the order by the Agency or its agents.\r\n  But a special guaranty of the order shall be required from the\r\n  subscriber with an agreement that the stock shall be retained as\r\n  security for the delivery of the oil on demand, and the demand shall\r\n  be made within thirty days after the order for the oil is received\r\n  by the Agency.\r\n\r\n  VII. Members of the Petroleum Producers’ Association shall sell\r\n  their oil only to the Agency. The Agency shall purchase all the oil\r\n  offered by members of the Association and shall pay therefor at\r\n  least five dollars per barrel for oil of standard grade, and for the\r\n  heavy oil of the fifth district. Payment for oil purchased shall be\r\n  made as follows: If the market will take the entire supply as fast\r\n  as offered, the full market price shall be paid in cash on delivery;\r\n  but if the board of directors, or the Council, shall determine that\r\n  the oil daily offered to the Agency is in excess of the demand, the\r\n  Agency shall pay three dollars in cash and give the seller a\r\n  certificate entitling him to the net proceeds of the oil when sold,\r\n  less the amount advanced thereon.\r\n\r\n  VIII. The Agency shall sell no oil for a less price than five\r\n  dollars in cash, on delivery per barrel without the consent of the\r\n  Council of the Petroleum Producers’ Association.\r\n\r\n  IX. To the redemption of the certificates, on and after the tenth of\r\n  the month succeeding that in which they were issued, shall be\r\n  applied the proceeds of all the oil sold and delivered during that\r\n  month, less the amount advanced and the amount required to tank the\r\n  surplus oil. For the unpaid balance of the certificate the holder\r\n  shall, upon the surrender of the same, be entitled to a tank receipt\r\n  representing his interest in the amount of surplus oil in store and\r\n  tankage.\r\n\r\n  X. The Agency shall be entitled to receive for buying and selling\r\n  the oil such commissions per barrel as the Council may allow,\r\n  applicable first to the payment of expenses, second to the payment\r\n  of dividends on the capital stock, which shall be six per cent.\r\n  semi-annually, free of taxes.\r\n\r\n  XI. All the net proceeds of surplus oil sold shall be applied\r\n  specifically to the redemption of the tank receipts at their value,\r\n  the surrender of which shall be at the option of the holder.\r\n\r\n  XII. The Agency shall establish sub-agencies at such points within\r\n  the oil-producing district for the receipt, storage, and shipment of\r\n  oil as may be necessary to facilitate the convenient and economical\r\n  transaction of the business of the region, subject to the approval\r\n  of the Council.\r\n\r\n  XIII. The Agency shall provide all storage necessary to hold the oil\r\n  on sale and the surplus oil in store.\r\n\r\n  XIV. The price on the cars of oil of the standard grade shall be\r\n  uniform at all the sub-agencies on the line of the railways within\r\n  the oil-producing district, provided it be practicable to so arrange\r\n  with the railroads.\r\n\r\n  XV. A barrel shall be uniformly forty-two gallons.\r\n\r\n  XVI. Whenever the production of petroleum shall be permanently in\r\n  excess of the demand the Council of the Petroleum Producers’\r\n  Association shall determine at what time the production shall be\r\n  restrained and shall take such measures as may be practicable,\r\n  necessary, and lawful to prevent the drilling of oil wells, but it\r\n  shall confine its orders, so far as practicable to preventing the\r\n  starting of new wells, allowing those already in process of drilling\r\n  to be completed.\r\n\r\n  XVII. Whenever in the opinion of the board of directors it may be\r\n  advisable they may, subject to the approval of the Council, provide\r\n  such refining capacity as may be required to maintain the highest\r\n  price for crude petroleum consistent with the consumptive demand.\r\n\r\n  XVIII. The Agency shall not at any time sell to, or contract with,\r\n  or make any arrangement whatever, with any individual, organisation,\r\n  combination, or association, by which they may have a monopoly,\r\n  inside rate, advantage or preference over, or to the prejudice of,\r\n  any present or future competitor for the purchase of the crude oil\r\n  coming into, or passing through its hands; provided, that nothing in\r\n  this section shall be so construed as to prevent the Agency, with\r\n  the sanction of the Council, from making such temporary\r\n  discrimination as may be necessary for the purpose of protecting or\r\n  promoting the interests of producers by securing higher prices for\r\n  crude oil, increased consumption of refined oil, or decreased\r\n  margins between the price of crude and refined oil.\r\n\r\n  XIX. The Agency, with the approval of the Council, may take such\r\n  measures as may be expedient to increase the consumption of\r\n  petroleum by securing its application to new uses.\r\n\r\n  XX. The Agency shall publish daily a correct statement showing the\r\n  amount of oil purchased, the oil sold, and oil placed in store\r\n  during the day; also showing the points at which the same was done\r\n  and the amounts at the time in store at the various sub-agencies;\r\n  also the destination of the oil sold.\r\n\r\n  XXI. The Agency shall publish tri-monthly, full and complete reports\r\n  of all its transactions and showing its condition at the date of the\r\n  report; the correctness of the report shall be verified in such\r\n  manner as may be prescribed by the Council.\r\n\r\n  XXII. A committee may be appointed by the board of directors, or by\r\n  the Council of the Petroleum Producers’ Association, at any meeting,\r\n  for the purpose of investigating the condition and management of the\r\n  affairs of the Agency; and it shall be the right and duty of such\r\n  committee, duly appointed, to thoroughly investigate everything\r\n  affecting the interest of the Agency, to examine its books, accounts\r\n  and vouchers; its safes, vaults and tanks; and to make a true and\r\n  faithful report of the condition and management of the affairs of\r\n  the Agency as they may be found, which report shall be published at\r\n  the expense of the organisation which appointed the committee. It\r\n  shall be the duty of the Council to see that such committee is\r\n  appointed and such examination and report made and published at\r\n  least once in every year.\r\n\r\n  XXIII. The Agency shall establish a bureau of statistics and\r\n  information, which shall carefully collect and publish facts,\r\n  relating to the business of producing, refining, marketing and the\r\n  consumption of oil. The rooms of the bureau shall at all times be\r\n  open to the members of the Petroleum Producers’ Association, and the\r\n  Agency shall hold itself open for daily communications by telegraph\r\n  with local associations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 17 (See page 1123)\r\n    CONTRACT BETWEEN PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ ASSOCIATION AND PETROLEUM\r\n                         REFINERS’ ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From the Oil City Derrick.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The contract between the producers and refiners read as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, The necessities of trade call for co-operation between\r\n  the producers and refiners of oil, for purposes of mutual\r\n  protection:\r\n\r\n  _Therefore_, We, the undersigned, representing the Petroleum\r\n  Producers’ Association and the Petroleum Refiners’ Association,\r\n  hereby enter into the following articles of agreement, which\r\n  stipulate as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First._—Each of the two associations hereby agrees to appoint a\r\n  representative committee, which committee shall meet together\r\n  weekly, or as often as may be necessary, and at such places as they\r\n  may determine.\r\n\r\n  It shall be the duty of these committees (so far as in their power\r\n  lies) to see that the provisions of this agreement are executed in\r\n  good faith, and to discharge such duties as are devolved upon them\r\n  by this agreement, and in general (within the limitation of their\r\n  authority) to act for the mutual advantage of the trade, whose\r\n  interests it is the purpose of this agreement to secure.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The Producers’ Association shall appoint a comptroller,\r\n  who shall have the right to examine the books of the Refiners’\r\n  Association, and its daily reports so far as they relate to the\r\n  purchase, sale, and shipments of crude and refined oil, and who,\r\n  together with the auditor of the Refiners’ Association, shall make\r\n  joint reports daily to both associations.\r\n\r\n  The Refiners’ Association shall appoint a comptroller, who shall\r\n  have the right to examine the books of the Producers’ Association\r\n  and its agencies, and their daily reports, so far as they relate to\r\n  the purchase, sale, and shipments of crude and refined oil, and who,\r\n  together with the secretary of the Producers’ Association, shall\r\n  make joint reports daily to both associations of all sales and\r\n  shipments.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—Each association agrees that it will keep accurate books of\r\n  account, which shall show all purchases, sales, and shipments of\r\n  crude and refined oil, which shall also be open at all reasonable\r\n  hours to the inspection and examination of the authorised agents of\r\n  each association, as hereinbefore provided.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—The Refiners’ Association agrees to admit all existing\r\n  refiners to membership, and to a participation in the future\r\n  benefits of the association on equal terms with present members, and\r\n  the Producers’ Association agrees to allow all producers to join its\r\n  association on the same terms with the present members.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—The Producers’ Association agrees to sell (through its\r\n  regular appointed agencies) crude oil exclusively to the Refiners’\r\n  Association and its members, and the Refiners’ Association and its\r\n  members agree to purchase crude oil exclusively of the Producers’\r\n  Association or its appointed agents.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—The Producers’ Association agrees that all producers\r\n  enjoying the benefits of this contract shall be required to bind\r\n  themselves to sell their oil exclusively through the Producers’\r\n  Association.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—The Refiners’ Association and its members agree that they\r\n  will not until after sixty (60) days from the date of this contract\r\n  sell any portion of the crude or refined oil now held by them,\r\n  except so far as they shall have previously purchased the equivalent\r\n  of crude oil to take the place of the oil so sold.\r\n\r\n  They further agree to buy from the Producers’ Association daily such\r\n  quantities of crude oil as the markets of the world may take of\r\n  them, the same to be determined from time to time by the\r\n  representative committees herein provided for.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—The price of crude oil so purchased and sold to be\r\n  conditionally five dollars per barrel of forty-two gallons each, at\r\n  “common points,” payment to be made as follows:\r\n\r\n  When refined oil is sold in New York at twenty-six cents per gallon,\r\n  no additional amount is to be paid; but for every one cent per\r\n  gallon of advance in the average price of sales of refined oil in\r\n  New York, twenty-five cents per barrel shall be added to the price\r\n  of so much crude oil as shall be the equivalent of refined oil sold\r\n  at such advance until the price reaches five dollars per barrel.

BLANCHARD ON REBATES GRANTED BY THE ERIE RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879. Volume III, pages 3393–3395.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  October 1, 1872, when I first became general freight agent of the\r\n  Erie Railroad, no oil was produced in the Bradford District, and all\r\n  petroleum then transported by the Erie Railway eastward came from\r\n  the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. At that time, Adnah\r\n  Neyhart, of Tidioute, Pennsylvania, represented by W. T. Scheide,\r\n  afterwards by H. C. Ohlen at New York, shipped small quantities of\r\n  refined oil, for which he received a rebate of over $7,000 on his\r\n  shipments for the prior month, to wit, September, 1872.... I looked\r\n  for the reasons, and found the agreement next prior to that time as\r\n  to shipments and rates was the one already in evidence between\r\n  producers, shippers, refiners and railroad companies, dated March\r\n  25, 1872; I asked why that contract was not observed, and was then\r\n  convinced in reply that the agreement of March 25 lasted less than\r\n  two weeks, and that at that early date the Empire Line was receiving\r\n  a large drawback or commission from the Pennsylvania Railroad, which\r\n  was either being shared with its shippers or an additional amount\r\n  was being allowed to them, besides that which the Empire Line itself\r\n  received from the Pennsylvania system; and as the Empire Line also\r\n  owned the Union Pipe Line, its shippers had advantages which our\r\n  company and its shippers did not even jointly possess. At the close\r\n  of that calendar year (1872), the entire petroleum traffic for the\r\n  five months of the administration of President Watson, the former\r\n  president of the South Improvement Company, to January 1, 1873, was\r\n  but 265,853 barrels, or but about 53,000 barrels per month; while\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad was carrying about six times as much, or\r\n  300,000 barrels per month, and the New York Central was carrying the\r\n  entire refined oil sent from Cleveland to New York. The\r\n  representations then made to me also convinced the Atlantic and\r\n  Great Western Company as to what our rivals were doing, and that\r\n  railway company and our own decided to continue to pay the\r\n  twenty-four cents per barrel drawback then being paid on the rate of\r\n  $1.35 provided by this producers’ agreement of March 25, 1872.\r\n\r\n  It is therefore clear that one of the largest of the shippers, who\r\n  signed that March agreement, did not feel that it bound him to pay\r\n  the rates he had agreed to pay, and he gave convincing reasons to\r\n  believe that others, signers and parties to that agreement, did not\r\n  pay them, and possessed equal or greater advantages by way of rival\r\n  routes. Early in 1873 Mr. Scheide came to our line with Mr.\r\n  Neyhart’s crude business, under the circumstances Mr. Scheide has\r\n  stated, but being yet without any shippers of refined oil, and\r\n  believing that the Empire Line would pay a rebate on refined, as I\r\n  now know from Mr. Scheide’s testimony, they had paid Mr. Scheide on\r\n  crude, I opened negotiations to increase our traffic, which resulted\r\n  in an agreement, with the concurrence of the Atlantic and Great\r\n  Western, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,\r\n                    OFFICE OF SECOND VICE-PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                           NEW YORK, March 29, 1873.\r\n\r\n                               MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    Between John D. Archbold, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Porter, and Mr.\r\n    Osborn, and self. Rate for March, 1873, to be 132½ from Union.\r\n    Rate thereafter to be 125 from same point as the maximum for\r\n    1873. If the common point rate is made from Titusville at any\r\n    time in 1873, on _bona fide_ shipments, Erie and Atlantic and\r\n    Great Western will make same rate from same date. With this rate\r\n    the refiners agree to give us their entire product to New York\r\n    for the year, and the preference always at same rate as actual\r\n    shipment by other lines.\r\n\r\n                                          (Signed) JOHN D. ARCHBOLD.\r\n                                                   G. R. BLANCHARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This Mr. Bennett was also one of the signers to the agreement of\r\n  March 25, as a refiner, and from these gentlemen I also learned at\r\n  that time that this producers’ agreement was exploded by the action\r\n  of the Producers’ Union before that time.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding this agreement of March 29, 1873, with its reduced\r\n  rates, its signers left us in November, 1873, and gave the Empire\r\n  Line their entire shipments; and we were then left with but one\r\n  small shipper of refined oil, Mr. G. Heye, whose consignments were\r\n  small, and to retain even this small business, against similar\r\n  solicitations by our rivals we were compelled to make his rate $1.10\r\n  in November, 1873, instead of $1.50, as provided by this producers’\r\n  agreement.\r\n\r\n  These facts effectually refute the testimony of Mr. Patterson that\r\n  the agreement of March 25 continued for two years, or any other\r\n  period beyond three weeks, at the rates it stipulated, and show that\r\n  at least two of its signers did not feel bound to pay the rates it\r\n  named, and that they and others by other lines endeavoured\r\n  immediately after it was signed to obtain, and did secure reduced\r\n  rates, as usual before its execution and peddled their oil among\r\n  different railroads wherever they could secure an advantage, however\r\n  small, over each other or the railroads.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 19 (See page 1133)\r\n                       TESTIMONY OF W. T. SCHEIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879. Volume III, pages 2774–2777.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why were you shipping over the Pennsylvania road and not over\r\n  the Erie?\r\n\r\n  _A._ For the reason that the Pennsylvania was most eligibly situated\r\n  for our purposes.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How did you come, then, to ship over the Erie at all?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We came to ship over the Erie because of what we considered\r\n  very bad treatment on the part of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What was that bad treatment that you received at the hands of\r\n  the Pennsylvania road?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It consisted, principally, in a discrimination against us in\r\n  furnishing us with cars.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ They refused you transportation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were they refusing you transportation in the interest of the\r\n  combination?\r\n\r\n  _A._ In the interest of a peculiar idea that they had, that all\r\n  shippers should be placed upon the same basis.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And in consequence of that peculiar idea, they gave to other\r\n  shippers transportation and did not give it to you?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And that was the practical way in which that corporation\r\n  carried out that idea?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir; you will allow me to explain, please?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Yes; go on.\r\n\r\n  _A._ The oil business differs from other business in this, that it\r\n  is a daily crop; there is a certain amount of oil produced that has\r\n  to be shipped every day; the consumption, however, is not equal to\r\n  the daily production of our trade; the consumption varies and the\r\n  demand varies; the consequence is that there are seasons of the year\r\n  when a man engaged in shipping oil ships oil really at a loss\r\n  because there is no demand for it, and there are other seasons when\r\n  there is a large profit; now the Pennsylvania Railroad always\r\n  insisted upon having a large number of shippers; this large number\r\n  of shippers would ship only when there was profit, and when there\r\n  was no profit somebody else had to ship; we had been their shipper\r\n  for a number of years.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of their shipper—their leading shipper, do you\r\n  mean?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir; we did their business between Philadelphia and\r\n  Baltimore and New York.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were you their evener, so to speak?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We did not have any eveners in those days.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you practically stand in the position of an evener?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; we were simply their shipper of crude oil.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of their “shipper,” in the singular, do you mean\r\n  that you were their sole shipper, as you subsequently became on the\r\n  Erie?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I mean we had better rates of freight than anybody else could\r\n  have obtained over the Pennsylvania Railroad at that time.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And therefore monopolised the business; go on?\r\n\r\n  _A._ And the consequence is that in consequence of this change in\r\n  the demand that when there comes a season that there is a little\r\n  money in it, the Pennsylvania Railroad would encourage these\r\n  numerous small shippers who would come in and they would pro-rate\r\n  cars with them; they would only allow us to put in a requisition for\r\n  a certain number of cars and they would allow anybody else, an\r\n  entire stranger, a man who never shipped any before, to put in an\r\n  equal requisition, and they would pro-rate with him, and the\r\n  consequence was in the paying business we were out and in the\r\n  unpaying business we were in.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And you left it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Because you could not get rates better than other people?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; because we could not stand it; because we were losing\r\n  money.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ On the same basis that other people were?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; other people were not shipping except when there was a\r\n  profit.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why did you ship when there was not a profit?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Because that was our business; we were shippers of petroleum.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I don’t understand why you were obliged to ship at a loss?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is the reason why we left the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I don’t understand why you were obliged to ship at a loss?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We were in the petroleum business and shippers of petroleum,\r\n  and we had contracts; in order to keep the cars running it was\r\n  necessary for us to make a contract for one, two, three, five, or\r\n  six months ahead.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Sterne.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Isn’t it true that upon the basis of your having better rates\r\n  than anybody else, you proceeded to make contracts to extend your\r\n  business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ With the Pennsylvania road?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And that the moment that you were placed in the position of\r\n  having——\r\n\r\n  _A._ No transportation.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ No transportation equal to your expectations, with your special\r\n  rates?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I had to buy oil in New York.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That was the real fact?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The business was based upon the rate of transportation?\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Why did you have to buy oil in New York?\r\n\r\n  _A._ To fill my contract.\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Sterne._—He had made his contract upon the basis of his special\r\n  rate.\r\n\r\n  _The Witness._—And there was a certain supply of transportation\r\n  which was given to me.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Sterne.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Practically an exclusive supply of transportation you had at\r\n  one time over the Pennsylvania road, hadn’t you?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And when they changed their policy in that respect and gave\r\n  other people transportation, you could not fill the orders upon the\r\n  basis of which you had made your contracts?\r\n\r\n  _A._ You will excuse me; this would seem as though this was a sudden\r\n  arrangement; it was not; it lasted three or four years.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You had reason to suppose that it would last, had you not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ This policy of theirs.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ This policy.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That drove you on the Erie?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 20 (See page 1133)\r\nSTATEMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID FOR OVERCHARGES AND REBATES ON OIL DURING THE\r\n       YEAR 1873 BY THE NEW YORK, LAKE ERIE AND WESTERN RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879.

Volume III, pages 3398–3402.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agreement concluded this seventeenth day of April, A.D. 1874, by and\r\n  between the Erie Railway Company and the Atlantic and Great Western\r\n  Railroad Company, parties of the first part, and the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, of Cleveland, Ohio, party of the second part, _witnesseth_:\r\n\r\n  _First._—The parties of the first part (Erie Railway Company and the\r\n  Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company) agree to furnish a\r\n  sufficient number of good and suitable cars for the purpose of\r\n  transporting petroleum and its products from the refineries now\r\n  owned by the party of the second part (Standard Oil Company), at\r\n  Cleveland, Ohio, and Oil City, Pennsylvania, and any others they may\r\n  hereafter control or own, to Weehawken Oil Yards, in New Jersey.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The parties of the first part agree to transport said\r\n  products of said refineries, and deliver the same in cars (if\r\n  destined for the New York market) at and upon the side tracks\r\n  connected with said Weehawken Oil Yards, in good order and\r\n  condition, except as provided for in Article Four (4), and do all\r\n  switching of cars at said oil yards necessary to the prompt and\r\n  rapid discharge and handling of cars employed in said business. They\r\n  also agree to haul said cars (whenever practicable) in full trains\r\n  over their respective roads, with promptness and uniformity of\r\n  movement, and accept compensation therefor as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—Rates of freight on all said products to be made from time\r\n  to time between J. H. Devereux, president of the Atlantic and Great\r\n  Western Railroad Company, and the Standard Oil Company; the same to\r\n  be to the satisfaction of the said J. H. Devereux, president; to be,\r\n  however, no higher than is paid by the competitors of the said\r\n  Standard Oil Company, from competing Western refineries to New York\r\n  by all rail lines—each of said railway companies accepting its _pro\r\n  rata_ proportion of the through rate thus made.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—The party of the second part agrees not to ship more than\r\n  fifty (50) per cent. of the product of its said refineries by any\r\n  other line or lines Eastward, to be shown by monthly statements\r\n  verified by its president and secretary. It also agrees to assume\r\n  all risks and losses of its property by fire when in the charge or\r\n  custody of the parties of the first part, whether said property is\r\n  being moved in trains or stored, or lying at any station between\r\n  place of shipment and destination (both included). It further agrees\r\n  to assume all losses from natural leakage or breakage, except the\r\n  same is caused by collisions or the wrecking of cars by unavoidable\r\n  accidents. It also agrees, at its own cost, to safely load at places\r\n  of shipment all of said products, and unload the same when delivered\r\n  at the said Weehawken Oil Yards, and furnish said products for\r\n  shipment with as great regularity as possible.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—In the event of unavoidable detention, occasioned by the\r\n  elements, or by strikes of employees of the parties of the first\r\n  part, or either of them, whereby said first parties are unable (for\r\n  the time being) to fulfill their covenants under this agreement,\r\n  then it shall be the duty of said first parties to immediately\r\n  notify the second party of such casualty or strikes, and such\r\n  casualty or strike shall be considered good and sufficient cause for\r\n  delay in the execution (for the time being) of the provisions of\r\n  this agreement. And said first parties, and each of them, shall be\r\n  saved from all obligation for the fulfillment of this agreement\r\n  during the period of such detention, anything in this contract to\r\n  the contrary notwithstanding. It shall be the duty of said first\r\n  parties to proceed forthwith to put themselves in position to resume\r\n  their obligations under this agreement, giving notice at the\r\n  earliest possible moment to the second party of their ability to\r\n  resume.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—The Erie Railway Company for itself hereby stipulates and\r\n  agrees to and with the second party, that on or before the first day\r\n  of May, A.D. 1874, it will give full and complete possession of the\r\n  property known as the Weehawken Oil Yards, in New Jersey, together\r\n  with all buildings, erections, docks and appurtenances thereunto,\r\n  belonging unto the second party to have and to hold, with all\r\n  revenues derived therefrom, from and after the said first day of\r\n  May, A.D. 1874, or until the expiration of this agreement, as\r\n  otherwise herein provided. The Erie Railway Company further agrees,\r\n  at its own cost, on or before the first day of May, A.D. 1874, to\r\n  put said buildings, erections and appurtenances in good repair;\r\n  after which said second party shall maintain the same in like good\r\n  order, and to do all dredging required to provide and preserve the\r\n  requisite depth of water.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—In consideration of the possession of said Weehawken Oil\r\n  Yards, the second party hereby agrees to and with the Erie Railway\r\n  Company as follows: to wit: To pay weekly to said Erie Railway\r\n  Company the sum of five (5) cents on each and every barrel (of 45\r\n  gallons) of crude oil, and the same sum on each and every barrel\r\n  (not to exceed 46 to 48 gallons) of the products of petroleum\r\n  passing through or into the aforesaid yards; the rate of five (5)\r\n  cents to be absolute on all said refined products, but subject to\r\n  rateable reductions on crude oil, in case the terminal charges on\r\n  crude oil are reduced, taking present schedule of rates thereon\r\n  (adopted November, 1872), a copy whereof is hereto annexed, as the\r\n  standard; the Erie Railway Company retaining the right to reduce\r\n  said schedule of rates on crude, to meet competition; the second\r\n  party further agrees to conduct said warehouse business in the name\r\n  of the Erie Railway Company, at its own cost and expense, to assume\r\n  such risks on the oil, while in its possession, as the Erie Railway\r\n  Company, or the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company would be\r\n  responsible for to forwarders, consignees, or owners after its\r\n  arrival and delivery in cars at yards; to make the charges uniform\r\n  to all parties who use the yards, or for whom services are performed\r\n  therein, and always as low as any other oil yard affording proper\r\n  facilities for the transfer, storage preparation and shipment of the\r\n  oil at the terminus of any railway, or other line competing with the\r\n  Erie Railway, at or adjacent to the port of New York, and generally\r\n  so to manage the premises as to give all patrons of the road fair\r\n  and equal facilities for their oil business at uniform cost, to\r\n  retain and pay the present superintendent and other officers and\r\n  employees of the yard, so long as their duties are satisfactorily\r\n  performed, and from time to time to appoint such other officers as\r\n  shall not be objected to by the Erie Railway Company, to maintain\r\n  the buildings, erections, and mechanical appliances of the premises\r\n  in as good order as when possession is given, natural wear and\r\n  unavoidable (by due diligence) damages from the elements excepted,\r\n  to make no rules or regulations discriminating against any other\r\n  shipper or shippers, or receivers. It is understood and agreed that\r\n  the consent of the Erie Railway Company is to be obtained before any\r\n  refined or crude oil shall be received at the Weehawken Oil Yards,\r\n  which arrives from the west via any transportation line competing\r\n  with the Erie Railway.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—It is further agreed that the second party shall assume\r\n  the charge and collection of freights and charges—accounts to be\r\n  rendered and adjusted, and paid weekly—Erie way-bills to govern\r\n  quantities received, except when the same are shown to be incorrect,\r\n  or loss in transit (except from natural leakage) has occurred\r\n  through fault or neglect of said railway companies, or either of\r\n  them. Any new fixtures which the party of the second part may add to\r\n  the property shall be and remain its property, and they may remove\r\n  the same at their cost, at the expiration of this agreement, unless\r\n  mutually satisfactory terms of purchase and sale can be agreed to.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—This agreement to take effect and be binding upon the\r\n  parties hereto, on the first day of May, A.D. 1874, and to continue\r\n  until the first day of May, A.D. 1877, provided, however, that\r\n  either party may terminate the same upon giving notice in writing to\r\n  the other party six (6) months in advance of its intention so to\r\n  terminate; and provided further, that within thirty days after the\r\n  election of a new board of directors, of either the Erie or Atlantic\r\n  and Great Western Railway Companies, the second party shall have the\r\n  right to terminate this agreement, by giving notice in writing to\r\n  the other party one month in advance of its intention so to\r\n  terminate, and upon the expiration of either of said periods, this\r\n  agreement shall be then at an end.\r\n\r\n  _Tenth._—In consideration of the premises, the party of the second\r\n  part agrees to pay to the Erie Railway Company, weekly, the sums\r\n  which such weekly settlement shall show to be due to the said first\r\n  parties, as freight on its property delivered at the Weehawken Oil\r\n  Yards.\r\n\r\n  _Eleventh._—It is hereby expressly understood and agreed that\r\n  neither of the said parties of the first part shall be liable for\r\n  the acts or defaults of the other; and that each shall only be\r\n  liable for its own acts and defaults, on and over its own line and\r\n  premises.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the parties hereto have affixed their hands,\r\n  this twentieth day of April, 1874.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) THE ERIE RAILWAY COMPANY,\r\n\r\n                          By G. R. BLANCHARD, _Second Vice-President_.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) THE ATLANTIC AND GREAT WESTERN RAILROAD COMPANY,\r\n\r\n                                       By J. H. DEVEREUX, _President_.\r\n\r\n  (Signed) STANDARD OIL COMPANY,\r\n\r\n                             By WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER, _Vice-President_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 22 (See page 1139)\r\n         AGREEMENT OF 1874 BETWEEN THE RAILROADS AND PIPE-LINES\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879. Volume III, pages 3431–3437.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Memorandum of agreement entered into this fourth day of September\r\n  A.D. 1874, by and between the following parties, viz.:\r\n\r\n  _First._—J. J. Vandergrift, G. V. Forman, and John Pitcairn, Jr.,\r\n  partners themselves, and agreeing that they have authority to\r\n  represent all other partners in the association trading under the\r\n  name of the United Pipe Lines, and holding themselves individually\r\n  responsible to the other parties hereto that they have such\r\n  authority.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The Union Pipe Company by Charles P. Hatch, manager.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—The Antwerp Pipe Company and the Oil City Pipe Company,\r\n  each being corporations under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—The American Transfer Company, a corporation under the\r\n  laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—The Grant Pipe Company, a corporation under the laws of the\r\n  State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—The Karns Pipe Line Company, a corporation under the laws\r\n  of the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—The Relief Pipe Line Company, a corporation under the\r\n  laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—The Pennsylvania Transportation Company, a corporation\r\n  under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—J. J. Vandergrift, G. V. Forman, and John Pitcairn, Jr.,\r\n  trading under the name of Vandergrift, Forman and Company, and\r\n  owning and representing the Milton and Sandy Pipe Lines.\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, The pipe lines owned and controlled by the parties hereto\r\n  have a joint capacity for transportation more than twice as great as\r\n  the total volume of petroleum produced in the district traversed by\r\n  said lines; and whereas, the separate and discordant relations now\r\n  prevailing among the parties hereto, lead to a needless\r\n  multiplication of extensions, branches, and other matters involving\r\n  heavy cost, which ultimately becomes in some shape a charge upon the\r\n  business transported, and also leads to the offering of open or\r\n  secret inducements of an illegitimate nature, such as rebates,\r\n  special rates, selling oil for less than its cost and full pipage\r\n  rates, and in other ways hereby to attract an under share of traffic\r\n  to the respective lines represented herein; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, it is believed to be desirable both for the interests of\r\n  the parties hereto and those of the public whom they serve, that all\r\n  needless expenditure and all illegitimate inducements should cease;\r\n  now,\r\n\r\n  _Therefore_, for those purposes and for other valuable\r\n  considerations mutually moving the parties hereto, they do each\r\n  respectively agree with each other, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First._—The parties hereto do not by these presents create in any\r\n  respect a partnership with each other, but each party is to be\r\n  wholly and solely responsible for all of its own acts in the conduct\r\n  of its business for its certificates, receipts, and collection of\r\n  its charges, its expenses, shortages, maintenance, and management of\r\n  its property, and of its engagements and obligations of every sort.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The pipe-lines which are covered by this agreement are\r\n  those which are or may be owned by any of the parties hereto, and\r\n  which are situated south of Oil City, and which terminate at any of\r\n  the following points, viz. points on the Franklin branch of the\r\n  Atlantic and Great Western Railway, points on the Jamestown and\r\n  Franklin branch of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway,\r\n  points on the Alleghany Valley, between or at Oil City and\r\n  Pittsburg, points on the Schenango and Alleghany Railroad and points\r\n  on the Butler branch railroad, excepting two small pipe lines, one\r\n  owned by F. Prentice and Company, running from Mount Hope to Foster,\r\n  and one owned by Vandergrift, Forman and Company, called the\r\n  Franklin Pipe Line, running from the heavy oil district to Franklin,\r\n  Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—Each party hereto shall retain eight (8) cents per each\r\n  forty-two (42) gallons remaining after deduction of allowances for\r\n  shortage and sediment, on all of the oil it actually pumps; also,\r\n  all allowances made it on such oil to meet shrinkage and sediment,\r\n  and also all of its other receipts of every description, except as\r\n  stated in the next article.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—Each party shall account monthly to the executive\r\n  committee hereinafter provided for, at the rate of twenty-two (22)\r\n  cents for each forty-two (42) gallons of petroleum (after deducting\r\n  shrinkage allowances) received by it for transportation during such\r\n  months; which twenty-two (22) cents shall be considered by said\r\n  committee as a common fund to be cleared and divided on the basis\r\n  hereinafter designated.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—The executive committee shall consist of one representative\r\n  from each of the parties hereto.\r\n\r\n  Each representative to be appointed by the party he represents to be\r\n  changeable from time to time by such party, at its pleasure; the\r\n  said committee shall faithfully execute such provisions of this\r\n  agreement as are by its terms confided to them.\r\n\r\n  Their action must, in all cases, be unanimous before it shall be\r\n  binding upon any party hereto.\r\n\r\n  They shall keep a record of their proceedings, to which each of the\r\n  members shall have free access, and whenever desired by any, a full\r\n  transcript, or any part thereof.\r\n\r\n  The members of said committee shall, until changed, as hereinbefore\r\n  provided, be as follows: Charles P. Hatch, representing the Union\r\n  Pipe Company; A. M. Hughes, representing the Antwerp Pipe Company\r\n  and the Oil City Pipe Company; D. O’Day, representing the American\r\n  Transfer Company; R. B. Allen, representing the Grant Pipe Company;\r\n  S. D. Karns, representing the Karns Pipe Line Company; F. Prentice,\r\n  representing the Relief Pipe Line Company; H. Harley, representing\r\n  the Pennsylvania Transportation Company; E. Hopkins, representing\r\n  the United Pipe Lines, Milton Pipe Line, and the Sandy Pipe Lines.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—Each party hereto shall furnish to the executive committee,\r\n  on or before the fifth of each month, a report of its business for\r\n  the month next preceding, duly verified by the affidavit of its\r\n  proper officer or agent; and the amounts found due by the executive\r\n  committee from any of the parties hereto shall be paid by them\r\n  through the executive committee to the parties to whom they may be\r\n  due, on or before the tenth of the month in which the report is\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—The committee shall prescribe the form of said return,\r\n  and shall act as a clearing house thereof. They shall have power to\r\n  verify the same by inspection of books and records, and shall make\r\n  to each party hereto, on or before the tenth day of each month, a\r\n  full exhibit of the results of the returns and clearings for the\r\n  next preceding month.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—The committee shall prescribe and enforce uniform rates\r\n  and conditions for the reception, storage, and transportation of\r\n  oil, including substantially uniform wordings of certificates and\r\n  gaugers’ tickets; uniform conditions for the accepting of tanks\r\n  owned by other parties; uniform conditions as to responsibility for\r\n  losses through unavoidable causes, such as lightning; and uniform\r\n  rates of allowances for shrinkages. Until changed by said committee,\r\n  the rates for transportation shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n  For each forty-two gallons remaining after deducting allowance for\r\n  shrinkage and sediment, viz., from all points which, by any\r\n  pipe-lines represented herein, which terminate at Oil City or on the\r\n  various railways as hereinbefore described, thirty (30) cents;\r\n  excepting, _First_, on oil reached by pipes terminating on the\r\n  Alleghany Valley Railroad south of Oil City, and north of Parker\r\n  City. _Second_, on oil from the west side of the Alleghany River,\r\n  not pumped from north of Bear Creek. _Third_, on oil pumped from\r\n  Sheakley to Monterey by the United Lines, and from south of Bear\r\n  Creek, and north of Sheakley district by the Union and Karns lines,\r\n  all of which shall be twenty-five (25) cents. But the rates on oil\r\n  covered by the third exception shall be made thirty (30) cents on or\r\n  before January 1, 1875. The only remaining exceptions to these rates\r\n  on such private contracts at different figures, as each party may\r\n  now have, a list of which together with any special conditions\r\n  appertaining thereto shall be filed with the executive committee on\r\n  or before September 1, 1874; no new contracts for transportation or\r\n  storage or tankage shall be made by any party whatever, except at\r\n  the regular rates as herein fixed, or as shall be, from time to\r\n  time, fixed by the executive committee. All rates less than thirty\r\n  (30) cents may be at any time advanced to thirty (30) cents by the\r\n  party subject thereto.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—The committee shall adopt all proper and practicable\r\n  measures to secure the transportation by each line of a share of the\r\n  total oil pumped each month by all the lines, equal in percentage to\r\n  the share of the common fund allotted to each herein, having\r\n  reference to the facilities of each party for doing the work; they\r\n  shall assign to each party, and as early in each case as possible,\r\n  such share of the duty of making extensions and connections with\r\n  wells as most legitimately appertains to it, or as may be required\r\n  by the well owner, or by the contracts of each party; but constant\r\n  reference shall be had to maintaining for each party its share as\r\n  heretofore described of the total oil to be transported, and to\r\n  distributing the total cost involved as nearly as practicable in the\r\n  proportion of the common fund assigned to each, and no other party\r\n  shall make such improvements except by consent of said committee.\r\n  The committee shall arrange with a chief gauger and the needful\r\n  assistants (all of whom shall be under oath to act honestly and\r\n  impartially), to gauge from time to time all tanks with which the\r\n  lines of the parties hereto are or may be connected, or car tanks\r\n  which they may load; and may collect the expense thereof from the\r\n  parties hereto in proportion to their respective shares in the\r\n  common fund; and may also assess upon the trade such reasonable\r\n  charge for car gauging, or may wholly waive such charge as they may\r\n  deem judicious.

The original Standard Oil Company was organised in the\r\n  early part of 1870. The increased capacity and the acquisition of\r\n  the Cleveland refineries was, as I remember it, in 1872. It remained\r\n  at that until 1875 or 1876,[85] according to the best of my\r\n  recollection. Then was consummated a negotiation which had been\r\n  pending for some two years, perhaps, with certain parties in\r\n  Pittsburg, Philadelphia and New York, by which a value was agreed\r\n  upon, and their refinery property was purchased and the capital of\r\n  the company was increased a still further sum of a million, and they\r\n  were paid for these properties, and money which they contributed, in\r\n  the stock of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Gowen.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When did the Standard Oil Company of Ohio first enter into an\r\n  alliance with other refineries?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If you mean, (by) an alliance, Mr. Gowen, I should say never.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I am only endeavouring to aid your friends in getting at what\r\n  they want. Here, I notice, they propose to prove by you—I will give\r\n  it in this way—that on account of the disastrous condition of the\r\n  refining business, the Standard, on October 15, 1874, entered into\r\n  an alliance with a number of Pittsburg refineries?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is more correctly stated by saying that the Standard Oil\r\n  Company _purchased_ the refineries owned by the parties in\r\n  Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Who were they?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Lockhart, Frew and Company, I think was the company. Wait a\r\n  moment. It was the Standard Oil Company of Pittsburg, it being a\r\n  corporation, and Warden, Frew and Company, of Philadelphia, and, I\r\n  should say, Charles Pratt and Company, of New York.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Any others?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ All those gentlemen, Warden, Frew and Company, and the Standard\r\n  Oil Company of Pittsburg, Charles Pratt and Company of New York, are\r\n  now associated with you as parties interested in the present Oil\r\n  Trust?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They are stockholders. The property formerly owned by them was\r\n  at that time purchased by the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of purchasing their interest, you do not exclude\r\n  them from their interest? They united with you and remained as your\r\n  associates in the business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If it was not from the fact that ours was a corporation, we\r\n  might call it a co-partnership.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ They becoming interested in yours, and you in theirs?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And you simply used your name to represent the joint ownership,\r\n  as it was a corporation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 26 (See page 1153)\r\n GEORGE H. BLANCHARD’S TESTIMONY ON THE BREAKING UP OF THE PIPE POOL OF\r\n                                  1874\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879. Volume III, pages 3445–3447 and 3449–3451.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The contract with the Standard Company of April 17, 1874, as I have\r\n  said, contained nothing inconsistent with our obligations to the\r\n  Pennsylvania and New York Central Railroads, and the New York\r\n  Central, under their later contract, and our company, convinced the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad of that fact during the discussions both as to\r\n  rates and each and every other detail agreed to, but President\r\n  Jewett thought it better to rely upon the arrangements between the\r\n  railway companies alone, and decided to avail himself of the ninth\r\n  clause of the agreement with the Standard Oil Company of April 17,\r\n  1874, which provided that either party might terminate it by six\r\n  months’ written notice, but that notice might be given by the\r\n  Standard Company within thirty days after the election of a new\r\n  board of directors of the Erie or Atlantic and Great Western\r\n  Company. This trunk line oil pool of October 1 being in operation,\r\n  President Jewett gave notice of the termination of the Standard\r\n  agreement of April 1, 1874, on October 31, 1874, which would have\r\n  terminated in six months. It was the thirty-first of the following\r\n  May, but an election having in the meantime taken place upon the\r\n  Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, the Standard Oil Company gave\r\n  the thirty days’ notice it had the right to do on January 13, 1875,\r\n  which, therefore, terminated the agreement upon February 13, 1875,\r\n  about three months and a half before President Jewett’s notice\r\n  could, under the contract, take effect.\r\n\r\n  The trunk line agreement of October 1, 1874, continued in force, and\r\n  pool settlements were made thereunder for but five months, namely,\r\n  until the close of February, 1875, during which time the Erie\r\n  Company paid $31,019.05 and received $6,570.55.\r\n\r\n  Notice of the abandonment of that contract was given by the Erie\r\n  Company, April 1, 1875, although no statements or moneys were\r\n  exchanged for March, and dissatisfaction with its operations had\r\n  been expressed by us prior to that time, the reasons therefor being\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  The higher rates of the pipe pool had stimulated new pipe-lines, and\r\n  the Hunter and Cummings Line and other small pipes had been\r\n  completed, or did not maintain the agreed rates of pipage. The\r\n  Columbia Conduit Company had also been completed to Pittsburg, in\r\n  the interest of the Baltimore and Ohio Company, and either acting\r\n  upon the then policy or advice of that company, or with a desire to\r\n  be bought out, declined to charge equal rates of pipage or agree to\r\n  any fixed rates, a fact which threatened the diversion of oil\r\n  largely to Baltimore, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad not being in\r\n  the trunk line oil pool of October 1, 1874, and publicly and\r\n  frequently announcing its endeavour to divert the oil trade to\r\n  Baltimore.\r\n\r\n  We also believed that large drawbacks or commissions were paid by\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad to the Empire Line in addition to those\r\n  provided in our joint pool contract; and our belief has since been\r\n  confirmed by later knowledge of the fact that the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad paid to the Empire Line about 30 per cent., including the\r\n  use of cars; and the mileage, being about ten (10) per cent. at\r\n  current rates of car service, left the commission equal to about 20\r\n  per cent., an advantage not possessed by any other shipper or\r\n  company over any of the northern lines.\r\n\r\n  It was clear that, as the Empire Line added to its already large\r\n  resources, not only this commission upon the oil business excepting\r\n  Pittsburg, but the added profits upon its pipe-lines, that its\r\n  combined operation and profit united to control an increasing share\r\n  of the entire trade and put it in strong financial shape for a\r\n  control which it subsequently entered upon to absorb also a large\r\n  refining interest.\r\n\r\n  As the northern trunk lines made no similar arrangements, allowances\r\n  or commissions to any forwarder or receiver, and derived no profit\r\n  from any pipe-lines, it was clearly unfair to concede them to the\r\n  Empire Line, and the agreement which gave it these growing\r\n  advantages was very properly annulled.\r\n\r\n  We also desired the actual transportation of the oil rather than to\r\n  receive money from others, as we had done during the pool, as their\r\n  increased business might finally result in a demand for larger\r\n  percentages if the pool continued.\r\n\r\n  I directed careful examination of our records up to date of the\r\n  abandonment of this oil pool contract; and upon the authority of\r\n  General Freight Agent Vilas, state that the net rates charged to the\r\n  Standard Company during this period to through points were uniform\r\n  with the rates charged by our lines to other shippers, taking into\r\n  account, as before stated, the transportation of the crude\r\n  equivalent to their refineries.... The preliminary discussions and\r\n  general conclusions relating to those (new) contracts were all with\r\n  President Jewett, although many of their details were subsequently\r\n  discussed and suggested by me; and the reasons influencing him to\r\n  make them have been stated by him in his testimony; I was directed\r\n  to carry them out, and have from time to time attended meetings at\r\n  which the rates thereunder were advanced or reduced. I believe those\r\n  contracts were not concluded until the latter part of April or early\r\n  in May, and were then dated back to the disruption of the trunk line\r\n  oil pool, in order to secure our guaranteed proportion of oil\r\n  shipments from that earlier date and without interruption. The\r\n  transportation contract continued to guarantee us 50 per cent. of\r\n  the business of the Standard Oil Company, which 50 per cent. should\r\n  not be less than the percentage we had received in the year 1874 of\r\n  the total arrivals at the seaboard; and at this time, for that\r\n  reason, the Standard Oil Company had no transportation arrangements\r\n  with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and this fact and guaranty induced\r\n  us to disregard the question as to whether or not the Standard\r\n  Company had similar or other contracts with the New York Central or\r\n  its connections, our only interest in the question being as to\r\n  whether rates were equal and if we received our guaranteed share of\r\n  the oil.\r\n\r\n  There was no understanding or agreement by the Erie Company to my\r\n  knowledge that the New York Central Company or Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad, or either of them, had or had not similar or other\r\n  contracts with the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  They were shipping by the New York Central route, and we assumed\r\n  from their large business, terminal arrangements, etc., that some\r\n  defined understanding probably regulated such large interests, but\r\n  we were not consulted as to the terms or conditions of its contracts\r\n  with other companies if it had any, because we relied upon their\r\n  responsible guaranty to give us our proportion of the total arrivals\r\n  of oil at the seaboard and at rates equal to those of other\r\n  companies, as ample protection to our interests.\r\n\r\n  At the time this transportation contract was made by the Erie\r\n  Company, other considerations than relief from risks and the\r\n  equalisation of the arrivals at the seaboard bore upon the contracts\r\n  for an allowance of 10 per cent. It continued to be our belief,\r\n  since fully confirmed by Mr. Cassatt’s testimony, that other\r\n  shippers _via_ the Empire Line over the Pennsylvania Railroad had at\r\n  least similar rates and arrangements, to which, on the part of the\r\n  Erie Company, no objection was offered; it also continued to be the\r\n  fact that the Empire Line continued to receive in addition to its\r\n  probable pipe profits, the same or about the same, large commission\r\n  as before, from the Pennsylvania Railroad, and it was believed by\r\n  the officers of the Erie in making this contract with the Standard\r\n  Company that the allowance to it of 10 per cent. was not much more\r\n  than one-half the allowance then being made by the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad to the Empire Line.\r\n\r\n  In addition thereto, we secured the actual transportation of our\r\n  full share of the oil, at the agreed rates, without delays or\r\n  disputes in adjustments, or the preparation or exchange of the pool\r\n  statements.\r\n\r\n  It maintained the business to New York and provided against any\r\n  increase to our rival railways or ports, no matter how the territory\r\n  of oil production might shift or vary, and while under the trunk\r\n  line pool we could not influence the various shippers to send them\r\n  oil over our railway or to this city, unless their varying and\r\n  dissimilar interests all agreed (as they did not), and no matter how\r\n  much one company might be in deficit, the Standard Company is\r\n  compelled to send it over our line. The loading and unloading, and\r\n  taking the risks, were also important items to us as has before been\r\n  detailed, and relieved us from a class of claims we had paid prior\r\n  to that time.\r\n\r\n  It was also important to us that by this contract we were explicitly\r\n  released from large losses when the great fire consumed the\r\n  Weehawken docks in July, 1874.\r\n\r\n  The ninth section of the contract has also been of much value to us.\r\n  In the delivery of oil to vessels or exporters, the Standard Company\r\n  assumes all the risks and expenses of delays to ships, and their\r\n  demurrage, even if it be the fault of the railway by nondelivery,\r\n  and I have known of cases where this amounted to a large sum.\r\n\r\n  In 1877 when the general and extended railway strikes occurred, this\r\n  clause also released us beyond doubt from large claims that might\r\n  otherwise have been urged.\r\n\r\n  The freight rates provided by the railway pool of October 1, 1874,\r\n  were not changed until October 1, 1875; and my recollection is that\r\n  it was not until the discussion upon that change that anything was\r\n  definitely known by any of the trunk lines of the arrangements of\r\n  the others with the Standard Oil Company. At that meeting the 10 per\r\n  cent. reduction to be allowed the Standard was distinctly understood\r\n  as due upon its shipments _via_ all the trunk lines in consideration\r\n  of the facts stated, and it then first came to my knowledge that\r\n  Warden, Frew and Company, of Philadelphia, represented the Standard\r\n  Oil Company, as Charles Pratt and Company represented their crude\r\n  interests at New York _via_ our line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 27 (See page 1196)\r\nMR. FLAGLER’S EXPLANATION OF THE COMMISSION OF 10 PER CENT. ALLOWED THE\r\n                      STANDARD OIL COMPANY IN 1877\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 774–775.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  I would like the privilege of explaining about that 10 per cent.\r\n  commission. The railroad companies, as perhaps Mr. Gowen will\r\n  remember, he at that time having been head of the Reading Railroad,\r\n  tried and did agree among themselves for divisions of the oil\r\n  business. I know that they agreed among themselves that a certain\r\n  percentage of it the New York Central should take; a certain other\r\n  percentage the Erie should take; a certain other percentage the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad should take; and a certain other percentage\r\n  the Baltimore and Ohio should take. We were only anxious that\r\n  uniform rates should be maintained by these roads. All these roads,\r\n  and each one of the roads, found it impossible to secure the\r\n  divisions of the business as they had agreed upon. Notwithstanding,\r\n  we co-operated with them, for we were heartily in favour of its\r\n  being done and were only seeking for a uniformity of rates by the\r\n  different roads. But as any gentleman connected with railroad\r\n  interests well knows there always is that desire to get more than\r\n  belongs to the line. That desire kept cropping out in the practical\r\n  shape of cutting under rates for the sake of getting a little more,\r\n  each road feeling that it was not getting enough to insure it its\r\n  percentage. The Standard Oil Company at that time owned a very large\r\n  percentage of the entire oil traffic. It was possible for it to do a\r\n  service for the roads that the roads were unable to do for\r\n  themselves. That service, however, involved a good many hardships.\r\n\r\n  The practical working of it was this, that at the end of each month\r\n  after the arrangement had been made, each of these railroad\r\n  companies, they first having agreed how they would divide among\r\n  themselves and not seek to go beyond that certain percentage—at the\r\n  end of each month each railroad company sent to us a statement of\r\n  the number of barrels of oil they had transported during the month.\r\n  It was incumbent upon us during the succeeding month to ship over\r\n  the road or roads which had received less than its percentage an\r\n  amount during that following month sufficient to bring up the\r\n  deficit of the previous month. Undertaking to do that meant, as I\r\n  well knew at the time, a responsibility imposed upon us, and an\r\n  obligation to run refineries at certain localities which perhaps at\r\n  the time it was unprofitable for us to run. It meant a steady\r\n  continuance of a large volume of business at periods of time when it\r\n  might not be profitable to run them; and if the gentlemen of the\r\n  committee will bear with me just a moment you will see the\r\n  difficulties. It was not only the three trunk lines—the New York\r\n  Central, terminating at Buffalo, the Pennsylvania, terminating at\r\n  Pittsburg, and the Baltimore and Ohio, I don’t know where—but there\r\n  came in their Western connections. I remember well the New York\r\n  Central had two; the Lake Shore was its connection west of Buffalo\r\n  to Cleveland, and the Dunkirk and Allegheny Valley was its western\r\n  division to the Oil Region. It was not an easy matter, for we had\r\n  not only to regard the percentage delivered at the seaboard, but we\r\n  had to try to keep the Lake Shore satisfied with its proportion, the\r\n  New York Central’s proportion, and the Dunkirk and Allegheny\r\n  Valley’s proportion. As I say, it was no light task, and realising\r\n  that, I said to these gentlemen, “We will undertake to do this\r\n  business for you, to secure to each one of you the percentage which\r\n  we may have agreed upon, upon condition that we are paid for that\r\n  service a sum which shall be equal to 10 per cent. of the rate you\r\n  receive for doing the business.” There were, however, to be added to\r\n  what I have already stated as an inducement for the railroad\r\n  companies to pay that commission, other agreements, one of which was\r\n  that we assumed the risk of loss by fire in transportation. That may\r\n  seem to be to the gentlemen of the committee a cheap thing to do,\r\n  but Mr. Gowen understands, as well as I do, that a railroad company\r\n  cannot divest itself of the obligations by the common law imposed\r\n  upon it as a common carrier without a special agreement to that\r\n  effect. We took that risk, and did not collect from the railroad\r\n  companies, any of them, any losses sustained by fire in transit. We\r\n  furnished terminal facilities at the seaboard free of charge to the\r\n  railroad companies, and for all this service the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad agreed to pay us a commission of 10 per cent. We carried\r\n  out our part of the contract faithfully, and secured to the roads\r\n  such a division of the traffic as kept them in a state of accord and\r\n  peace, so far as quantity was concerned, and yet the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad paid to other shippers than ourselves a rebate or a\r\n  drawback, or whatever you choose to call it, on their shipments,\r\n  which were exactly equal to the 10 per cent. they agreed to pay us.\r\n  So that in that respect we were not favoured at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 28 (See page 1196)\r\n  CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER AND MR.

SCOTT,\r\n      President Pennsylvania Railroad Company.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_: In consideration of the covenants by your company to be\r\n  performed as hereinafter mentioned, we will agree as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First._—It having been agreed by the trunk lines that of all the\r\n  oil shipped by the trunk lines to the cities of New York,\r\n  Philadelphia, and Baltimore, 63 per cent. shall be considered as the\r\n  proportion which would naturally go to the City of New York, and it\r\n  having been further agreed that of this percentage one-third shall\r\n  be transported over each of the trunk lines having termini in New\r\n  York, viz.: The New York Central, Erie, and Pennsylvania, we agree,\r\n  unless the aforesaid division shall be changed by mutual consent of\r\n  said trunk lines, to ship such quantities of oil over your lines,\r\n  from time to time, as will, when added to the quantities shipped by\r\n  parties other than ourselves, give your line one-third of the\r\n  shipments to New York by the said trunk lines, or 21 per cent. of\r\n  the whole amount shipped to the three cities above named by the said\r\n  trunk lines; it being understood that in stating the number of\r\n  barrels for the purpose of making this division or for carrying out\r\n  any of the other stipulations herein contained, the barrel of\r\n  forty-five gallons of crude shall be the unit, and that each barrel\r\n  of the usual size of refined oil shall be counted as equal to one\r\n  and three-tenths barrels of crude.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—It having been agreed, as we are informed, between your\r\n  company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, that of the\r\n  remaining 37 per cent. of the total shipments aforesaid you should\r\n  be entitled to transport by lines owned and controlled by your\r\n  company to Philadelphia and Baltimore, 26 per cent., and the\r\n  Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company to Baltimore by its lines 11 per\r\n  cent., we agree, until these proportions are changed by mutual\r\n  consent, to ship such quantities to Philadelphia and Baltimore by\r\n  lines owned and controlled by your company as will, when added to\r\n  shipments of parties other than ourselves, give for transportation\r\n  by your lines to Philadelphia and Baltimore, 26 per cent. of the\r\n  total shipments by the four trunk lines to the three seaboard cities\r\n  above named.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—We further agree that the quantity of oil which we will\r\n  ourselves ship over your line shall not in any calendar year be less\r\n  than two million barrels, based upon an average production of not\r\n  less than thirty thousand barrels per day. If we should fail to give\r\n  you traffic herein named, we will pay to you a sum equal to the\r\n  profits which you would have realised upon the quantity in\r\n  deficit—provided, however, that you will at all times furnish us\r\n  with transportation, as we may reasonably require it.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—We will, of the proportion of oil going to Philadelphia,\r\n  refine as much as is practicable in Philadelphia, as we understand\r\n  that you desire to see the refining capacity of Philadelphia fully\r\n  employed, and, if needful, increased. And in shipping by your lines,\r\n  whether to Philadelphia, Baltimore, or New York, we will endeavour\r\n  to deliver the oil to you at points from which you will have short\r\n  hauls; and to the extent that we can, we will make the proportion of\r\n  crude shipped as large as possible, as we understand its\r\n  transportation to be more profitable to you than that of refined\r\n  oil.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—We ask, in consideration of the above named guarantee of\r\n  business, upon which it is understood we shall pay such rates as may\r\n  be fixed from time to time by the four trunk lines (which rates it\r\n  is understood shall be so fixed by the trunk lines as to place us on\r\n  a parity as to cost of transportation with shippers by competing\r\n  lines), that you shall furnish us promptly all the transportation we\r\n  may reasonably require; and that you shall allow to, and pay us,\r\n  weekly, such commission on our own shipments and the shipments which\r\n  we may control, as may be agreed to by your company and the other\r\n  trunk lines from time to time; this commission, it is understood,\r\n  has for the present been fixed at 10 per cent. upon the rate, and\r\n  shall not be fixed at a less percentage, except by mutual agreement\r\n  of your company and ours—provided, that no other shipper of oil by\r\n  your line shall pay less than the rate fixed for us before such\r\n  commission is deducted; and no commission shall be allowed any other\r\n  shipper unless he shall guarantee and furnish you such quantity of\r\n  oil for shipment as will, after deduction of commission allowed him,\r\n  realise to you the same amount of profit you realise from our trade;\r\n  that is, you will not allow any other shipper of oil any part of\r\n  such commission, unless after such allowance you realise from the\r\n  total of his business the same total amount of profit you realise\r\n  from the total of our business, except so far as your company may be\r\n  compelled to fill certain contracts for transportation made by the\r\n  Empire Line with refiners and producers, which contracts terminate\r\n  on or before May 1, 1878, a statement of which shall accompany your\r\n  reply to this letter—such contracts to be fulfilled. We agree that\r\n  all the stipulations herein contained shall be carried out by us for\r\n  the period of five years from the date hereof, unless sooner changed\r\n  or terminated by mutual consent, provided that you advise us in\r\n  writing within ten days that your company accept, and will carry\r\n  out, its part of the arrangement for the like term. In entering into\r\n  this agreement we desire to put ourselves on record as expressing\r\n  our wish and intention of making our business relations with your\r\n  company such that not only your main lines but the connecting lines\r\n  controlled by you, especially the Allegheny Valley Railroad, shall\r\n  secure the best possible results from the oil traffic consistent\r\n  with our existing obligations to other transportation interests. We\r\n  feel that the location of our refineries—all of which can be reached\r\n  by your lines—should naturally create a close alliance between your\r\n  company and ours, and that the best results from this important\r\n  traffic can only be secured to yourselves and ourselves, and, we\r\n  might add, to the entire petroleum interests of the country, by the\r\n  establishment of friendly and mutually satisfactory arrangements\r\n  between us.\r\n\r\n             Yours truly,\r\n                                     STANDARD OIL COMPANY,\r\n                                     By WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER,\r\n                                                     _Vice-President_.\r\n\r\n\r\n             OFFICE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY,\r\n                                       PHILADELPHIA, October 17, 1877.\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM ROCKEFELLER,\r\n      Vice-President Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  _My Dear Sir_: I am in receipt of your letter of this date, reciting\r\n  the understanding and agreement to exist between the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad Company and your company for a period of five years.\r\n\r\n  I beg leave to say that the same covers the whole basis of the\r\n  arrangements, and is satisfactory to this company—the provisions of\r\n  which will be duly carried out by it.\r\n\r\n                    Very respectfully yours,\r\n                                                THOMAS A.

CASSATT,\r\n        Third Vice-President, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_: Referring to the conversation I had with you in January,\r\n  I wish to submit the following facts: That our company has at large\r\n  expense (involving the payment of several hundred thousand dollars),\r\n  purchased and created certain pipe-lines to Pittsburg, through which\r\n  we are able not only to protect the Allegheny Valley road in a\r\n  paying rate of freight for the oil it carries, but also to secure to\r\n  that company (by agreement with it) its full proportion of the oil\r\n  traffic going to Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n  You are acquainted with the efforts we have put forth in other\r\n  directions during the last months in which we have acted in thorough\r\n  accord with the trunk line interests, and I believe I may say\r\n  without egotism, we have, to the extent of our ability, effectually\r\n  protected their interests in such action. I here repeat what I once\r\n  stated to you and which I asked you to receive and treat as strictly\r\n  confidential, that we have, been for many months receiving from the\r\n  New York Central and Erie Railroads certain sums of money, in no\r\n  instance less than twenty cents per barrel on every barrel of crude\r\n  oil carried by each of those roads.\r\n\r\n  Co-operating, as we are doing, with the Standard Oil Company and the\r\n  trunk lines in every effort to secure for the railroads paying rates\r\n  of freight on the oil they carry, I am constrained to say to you\r\n  that, in justice to the interest I represent, we should receive from\r\n  your company at least twenty cents on each barrel of crude oil you\r\n  transport.\r\n\r\n  The fruit of co-operation referred to has been fully evidenced in\r\n  the fact that since last fall your company has received fifty to\r\n  sixty cents per barrel more freight than was obtained by it prior to\r\n  our co-operation.\r\n\r\n  In submitting this proposition I feel I should ask you to let this\r\n  date from the first of November, 1877, but I am willing to accept as\r\n  a compromise (which is to be regarded as strictly a private one\r\n  between your company and ours) the payment by you of twenty cents\r\n  per barrel on all crude oil shipments commencing with February 1,\r\n  1878.\r\n\r\n  I make this proposition with the full expectation that it will be\r\n  acceptable to your company, but with the understanding on my part\r\n  that in so doing, I am not asking as much of the Pennsylvania road\r\n  and its connections as I have been and am receiving from the other\r\n  trunk lines.\r\n\r\n  You are doubtless aware that during the last two years a large\r\n  amount of oil has been shipped to Richmond _via_ the Chesapeake and\r\n  Ohio road, and that since the purchase of the Pittsburg lines by us\r\n  not one barrel has been permitted to go in that direction.\r\n\r\n  During the season of 1877, and so long as the Columbia Conduit\r\n  Company afforded the Baltimore and Ohio road access to the Oil\r\n  Regions, that company, I understood, refused to accept from the\r\n  other trunk lines (for its proportion of the oil traffic) less than\r\n  20 per cent., but after the purchase by us of the Columbia Conduit\r\n  you succeeded in arranging with the Baltimore and Ohio for about\r\n  half as much as they previously claimed.\r\n\r\n  I may add that the Baltimore and Ohio road are wholly dependent upon\r\n  us for any oil they may carry.\r\n\r\n                 Yours truly,\r\n                                         (Signed) DANIEL O’DAY,\r\n                                                    _General Manager_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, May 15, 1878.\r\n\r\n  R. W. DOWNING, Comptroller.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_: I enclose herewith copy of letter from Daniel O’Day,\r\n  general manager of the American Transfer Company, which refers to a\r\n  conversation I had with him in January last in reference to allowing\r\n  the American Transfer Company a commission of twenty cents per\r\n  barrel on all crude oil transported over this company’s lines to New\r\n  York, Philadelphia and Baltimore.\r\n\r\n  I agreed to allow this commission from and after February 1, until\r\n  further notice, after having seen receipted bills showing that the\r\n  New York Central Railroad allowed them a commission of thirty-five\r\n  cents per barrel and that the Erie Railway allowed them a commission\r\n  of twenty cents per barrel on Bradford oil, and thirty cents per\r\n  barrel on all other oil, and that they had been doing so\r\n  continuously since the 17th of October last.\r\n\r\n  Of this, however, you saw the evidence yourself in the bills which I\r\n  submitted to you last week. Please, therefore, prepare vouchers in\r\n  favour of the American Transfer Company per Daniel O’Day, for this\r\n  commission of twenty cents on shipments during February, March and\r\n  April, and hereafter make settlements with that company monthly.\r\n\r\n                   Yours truly,\r\n                                   (Signed) A.

FLAGLER’S TESTIMONY ON THE REBATE PAID TO THE AMERICAN TRANSFER\r\n                                COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 777–778.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Mr. Cassatt testified and offered in evidence the\r\n  correspondence which showed that his company agreed to the payment\r\n  of that 22½ cents to the American Transfer Company on every barrel\r\n  of crude oil passing over their line in consequence of the fact that\r\n  the writer of the first letter on behalf of the American Transfer\r\n  Company had asserted that the New York Central and the New York and\r\n  Lake Erie roads paid the same amount. You know that to be a fact, do\r\n  you not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ May I explain that now?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You are entitled to make any explanation you wish.\r\n\r\n  _A._ The American Transfer Company was built originally for, really,\r\n  the New York Central road. The New York Central had no means of\r\n  getting south of Titusville with its cars. The American Transfer\r\n  Company’s lines were built really in the interest of the New York\r\n  Central road. In those days the pipe-lines purchased the oil and\r\n  oftentimes sold it at just what they paid for it, and sometimes\r\n  less. They got more when they could. The New York Central, as I\r\n  said, paid the American Transfer Company a price, which I presume\r\n  was the figures named in Mr. Cassatt’s testimony, for collecting oil\r\n  in the lower country and delivering it to the Dunkirk and Allegheny\r\n  Valley, which is the New York Central’s connection. As that\r\n  pipe-line increased its business the Erie road did the same thing.\r\n  Later the Pennsylvania Railroad wanted the service of that pipe-line\r\n  in collecting oil. Mr. O’Day did what I suppose any manager would\r\n  do. He said to Mr. Cassatt, if you do the same thing for me that the\r\n  other roads are doing, I have no objection to making the same\r\n  arrangement with you. The payment made by the Pennsylvania, the\r\n  Erie, and the New York Central roads constituted the gross income of\r\n  the American Transfer Company, out of which it paid its expenses of\r\n  doing its business and its losses, if it made any, in the purchase\r\n  and sale of oil. It acted as a factor for those northern roads, and,\r\n  as I said, was originally built in order that oils might be reached\r\n  by the New York Central.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But in addition to the sum of 22½ cents, or whatever it may\r\n  have been, which these trunk lines paid to the American Transfer\r\n  Company, that company as a transporter of oil through its own pipe\r\n  got this pipage charge besides?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I never so understood it. As I remember the facts in the case,\r\n  while there was a nominal pipage—there might have been; I do not say\r\n  there was; I do not remember.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You do not say there was?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not remember. But while there might have been a nominal\r\n  pipage, that nominal pipage might have been absorbed in the crude\r\n  oil. In other words, it threw away its nominal pipage and relied——\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I am speaking now solely of the relations of the American\r\n  Transfer Company to the railroads. The former received 22½ cents on\r\n  every barrel of oil passing over the Pennsylvania road and the other\r\n  roads. But the American Transfer Company was a transporter of oil\r\n  itself, and to the extent it transported oil through its pipes it\r\n  made charge for that service also?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is a point where I say I want to correct you. While it may\r\n  have made a nominal charge, about which my memory fails me, I say it\r\n  threw away that nominal charge by paying to the owner or the\r\n  producer of the oil the value of the oil at the wells, plus what\r\n  that pipage might have been, and that twenty odd cents paid by the\r\n  Pennsylvania constituted its gross revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 31 (See page 1199)\r\n   LETTER TO PRESIDENT SCOTT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD FROM B.

PATTERSON\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 363–365.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY.\r\n\r\n  _Gentlemen_: About July 1 last the undersigned were of a delegation\r\n  from the Oil Region of our state, asking of your road an assurance\r\n  that its course during the preceding two months, in giving to all\r\n  producers and shippers of petroleum equal facilities and impartial\r\n  rates, might be formally made its permanent policy.\r\n\r\n  In an interview with your president at that time, that assurance was\r\n  given, coupled with the requisition that such support should be\r\n  given it by the producers and shippers as would repay it for the\r\n  exertion it must make in defending that policy, and guaranteeing\r\n  that such support should be continuous and permanent.\r\n\r\n  The people of the Oil Region were only too glad to enter into such\r\n  an agreement, and steps were immediately taken of a practical nature\r\n  to carry it out.\r\n\r\n  It was understood that it could not be _immediately_ done.\r\n\r\n  After the formal abandonment by the trunk lines of the South\r\n  Improvement Company in 1872, your road for some months faithfully\r\n  adhered, as we believe, to the pledge then given by all the trunk\r\n  lines, that no discrimination should thenceforth be permitted. We\r\n  believe also that it stood alone among the roads in adhering to it,\r\n  for gradually the persons constituting the South Improvement Company\r\n  were placed by the roads in as favourable a position as to rates and\r\n  facilities as had been stipulated in the original contract with that\r\n  company. At this time the line of your road in Western Pennsylvania,\r\n  including that under your influence and control, was dotted with\r\n  refineries capable of producing a large proportion of the refined\r\n  oil needed by the world. The policy of the Standard Oil Company, the\r\n  successor in everything but name of the South Improvement Company,\r\n  has resulted in the dismantling and abandonment of every one of\r\n  those refineries (as soon as they fell into their possession) which\r\n  could not be reached by some other and a rival road to yours, and\r\n  now there are in the Oil Region proper but few refineries and those\r\n  universally owned by the Standard Oil Company, those in Pittsburg\r\n  being owned or controlled by that combination or by the Conduit or\r\n  Empire lines. The use and export of crude oil is but a small\r\n  proportion of the consumption, and time and money were required to\r\n  re-establish this great product upon its former basis, and these\r\n  people were glad to furnish all needed means to accomplish this end,\r\n  as are also capitalists at other points not strictly within the Oil\r\n  Region, yet upon your lines.\r\n\r\n  We are met in the midst of this preparation by assertion of agents\r\n  of the combination, and as accepted news by the press, that such a\r\n  combination is entered into, or under consideration by your road and\r\n  the Empire Transportation Company, the Erie, Central, Lake Shore,\r\n  and Baltimore roads of the one part, and the Standard Oil Company of\r\n  the other, as would preclude your road from carrying out the policy\r\n  announced by your president at the interview heretofore referred to.\r\n\r\n  We believe there is danger that such a result may be reached, and we\r\n  in behalf of these whom we represent, in making our efforts to\r\n  prevent its accomplishment, or if accomplished to defeat it, as the\r\n  first step, address this communication to you, desiring to present\r\n  its aspect as affecting your road from our stand-point.\r\n\r\n  So far as we, and the general public are affected, you will not\r\n  question that the present scheme is but the repetition of the South\r\n  Improvement scheme, never abandoned by its authors, and seeking the\r\n  sole and absolute control of all petroleum produced, purchased,\r\n  refined, and shipped within the states of Pennsylvania, New York,\r\n  Ohio, or West Virginia.\r\n\r\n  The over-production of 1873, 1874, 1875, and the consequent almost\r\n  entire destruction of petroleum values, gave the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, with its organisation and capital, almost the desired\r\n  monopoly. The equalisation of consumption and production of\r\n  1876–1877 brought that combination to the same point that they were\r\n  in 1872—utterly unable by reason of geographical position, if for no\r\n  other, to monopolise this product without the co-operation of _all_\r\n  the transportation, and then only under a contract similar to that\r\n  of the South Improvement Company, and including all of its dangerous\r\n  and extraordinary features. None other can serve them, and so they\r\n  stand to-day, and we believe that your road can enter into no\r\n  compromise, treaty, or arrangement which will serve the ends of the\r\n  monopoly, under any less stringent stipulations and devoid of the\r\n  liabilities thereof.\r\n\r\n  Under such an arrangement it is probable that the Central and Erie\r\n  have transported its oil, during nearly all of this year. It is now\r\n  an open secret in the producing region, that no charges follow the\r\n  shipments over at least one of these roads, and crude oil is\r\n  delivered in New York, on shipping order, at prices which barely\r\n  repay the cost of packages and contents, with little or no remainder\r\n  for transportation charges. This aid to the scheme of the\r\n  combination is possibly given in view of the high tariff and\r\n  consequent large revenue promised to be derived hereafter, when the\r\n  scheme has been made a success, and all opposition in trade and\r\n  transportation extinguished.\r\n\r\n  Suppose your opposition to be withdrawn, and you join the alliance,\r\n  when does your profit come in? We are entitled to impartiality. As\r\n  we are advised, the law, common and statute, provides for it; it\r\n  pronounces those participating in such a scheme conspirators against\r\n  the public weal, and there is no court upon your line but what will\r\n  enforce by mandamus and injunction the impartiality that we ask. The\r\n  combination will promise you an immediate increase of revenue. If we\r\n  are well advised, will you realise upon that promise? Can you make a\r\n  contract with them that if we do not succeed in destroying, it will\r\n  be their interest to keep? You will not have a refinery left; and\r\n  they are now completing pipe-lines from Pittsburg to Oil City, and\r\n  can deliver the oil received by all their pipe-lines, independent of\r\n  your road and its branches. In case of a contract with them executed\r\n  but afterwards broken, from what source will you derive your oil\r\n  traffic and what court will enforce the broken contract in your\r\n  favour? We urge that you cannot enter into any arrangement with the\r\n  monopoly that can be permanently useful to it and to you, and doubt\r\n  if it can be made temporarily so.\r\n\r\n  Suppose that you decline to enter into such a treaty, or any such\r\n  scheme, but announce and adhere to the opposite policy? There is no\r\n  law, not even that of necessity, to compel you to serve the ends of\r\n  the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  If Messrs. Vanderbilt and Jewett believe that their aid alone is\r\n  insufficient to the establishment of the monopoly, for how long will\r\n  they carry its oil as at present for nothing, when they could have\r\n  full rates, by uniting the railroad interest, and leaving the\r\n  Standard Oil Company to do its business in common with all others?\r\n\r\n  If the Pennsylvania Railroad, having the geographical position in\r\n  its favour, will announce and adhere to the policy of impartial and\r\n  competitive rates, in three or six months, it can have all the\r\n  facilities and extent of business which the Standard Oil Company can\r\n  give the competitive roads, and by men who have all to gain by so\r\n  doing.\r\n\r\n  We ask consideration of our views and of our assurance of good\r\n  results from their favourable consideration.\r\n\r\n  If you choose to place the matter in the light of an experiment, its\r\n  trial can cost you nothing but the failure to realise upon the\r\n  immediate fulfillment of the promises of the common enemy, and that\r\n  realisation we believe will not be permitted.\r\n\r\n               Very respectfully,\r\n                                       B. B. CAMPBELL, of Pittsburg,\r\n                                       E. G.

HARTRANFT, OF PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3112, pages 351–356.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Sir_: The undersigned, members of a committee appointed by the\r\n  General Council of the Petroleum Producers’ Union for that purpose,\r\n  address to you, as the official head of the Commonwealth, a plain\r\n  statement of facts, to a great extent known to be true from personal\r\n  knowledge, and all material parts of which are susceptible of proof\r\n  by competent evidence.\r\n\r\n  We address you, not only as individuals whose personal interests\r\n  have been affected, whose property has been rendered comparatively\r\n  valueless, and whose capital and labour are bound against their\r\n  consent, to increasing the gains of grasping corporations, but as\r\n  citizens of the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apparently\r\n  prostrate and powerless to control one of its greatest products, and\r\n  the immense business that annually flows from it.\r\n\r\n  The petroleum production of Pennsylvania is confined geographically\r\n  to the Northwestern portion of the state, extending from its border\r\n  upon New York State nearly to Pittsburg, and is the chief interest\r\n  in the counties of McKean, Warren, Forest, Crawford, Venango,\r\n  Clarion, Butler and Armstrong.\r\n\r\n  The amount of money invested in well property, constantly to be\r\n  renewed and kept good, represents at least twenty millions of\r\n  dollars, and while the value of the lands upon which the wells are\r\n  located is not easily determined, it represents many times the value\r\n  of the well property.\r\n\r\n  Petroleum should yield at the wells, with its transportation and\r\n  sale unfettered, twenty-five to thirty-five million dollars\r\n  annually, while as an article of export, it ranks third among the\r\n  products of the nation, and as first among its manufactured exports.\r\n\r\n  For transportation outlets, it has the Pennsylvania Railroad to the\r\n  seaboard at an average distance therefrom of less than 400 miles.\r\n  The New York Central and Lake Shore Railroads reach Oil City by way\r\n  of Cleveland, Ohio, 764 miles from the seaboard, and Titusville, by\r\n  way of Dunkirk, New York, 571 miles to the seaboard, and the New\r\n  York, Lake Erie and Western, and Atlantic and Great Western Railways\r\n  reach Oil City by way of Meadville, 550 miles to the seaboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CONDITION OF THE TRADE IN 1871\r\n\r\n  At that time the lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the Oil\r\n  Region were dotted with refineries located at Tidioute, Henry’s\r\n  Bend, Oleopolis, Oil City, Corry, Titusville, Miller Farm,\r\n  Rouseville, and other points on the Oil Creek Railroad, at various\r\n  points on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad, and on the Allegheny\r\n  Valley Railroad, these roads being tributaries of and controlled by\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad, while upon its main line extensive\r\n  refineries were located at Pittsburg and Philadelphia. The\r\n  refineries at Cleveland, Ohio, confined themselves in a measure to\r\n  the Western domestic trade, and those of Portland, Boston and New\r\n  York had generally specialties in the trade.\r\n\r\n  The markets were filled with buyers of crude and refined;\r\n  information as to stocks, production and consumption was open and\r\n  obtainable, and values were regulated by the law of supply and\r\n  demand.\r\n\r\n  In its relation to this trade, Western Pennsylvania almost\r\n  exclusively possessing this product, with ample refineries in its\r\n  midst, with its great state railroad penetrating the producing\r\n  region, and by it, having the shortest route to the seaboard, with\r\n  the Allegheny River as an additional means of transportation to\r\n  Pittsburg, the Western terminus of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and\r\n  with Philadelphia, its Eastern terminus as an exporting point,\r\n  Pennsylvania had, and was entitled to, the control of the refining\r\n  and transportation of its own product.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CONDITION OF THE TRADE IN 1877–1878\r\n\r\n  Now, this is all changed! The refineries on the lines of the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad have been demolished, excepting where reached\r\n  by rival railroads, and this business has been transferred to\r\n  Cleveland and New York, the refineries remaining in this state\r\n  having passed into the ownership and control of a foreign\r\n  organisation, as has also the local transportation from the wells,\r\n  by means of pipe-lines to the lines of the railways.\r\n\r\n  The transportation of every nature is subject to its dictation; it\r\n  possesses every avenue of information; it affixes its own value to\r\n  the crude product when purchasing and the refined products when\r\n  selling; it establishes its own rates of compensation to be paid the\r\n  railways, and the laws of commerce which govern values in other\r\n  products are in this a part of the history of the past. So far as\r\n  the petroleum trade is concerned an enterprise or investment therein\r\n  is only a wager as to what step the Standard Oil combination will\r\n  next take. With the world consuming double the amount of our\r\n  petroleum that it did in 1871, the thirty millions which should be\r\n  received from the crude product has dwindled to its half; the\r\n  fifteen millions which should be the profit of Pennsylvania\r\n  refineries has been transferred to Ohio and New York, and the twenty\r\n  millions which should have swelled the earnings of the railways have\r\n  gone—no one dare say where—but the colossal fortunes acquired since\r\n  1872 by every member (so far as its members are known) of this now\r\n  world-renowned organisation, are proofs of the success attendant\r\n  upon a scheme, no less unlawful than gigantic, and which has all the\r\n  outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual corruption. To-day\r\n  a foreign corporation is the absolute master of the production and\r\n  its value, of transportation by pipe-lines, transportation by\r\n  railroad and the compensation therefor, of storage and refining, and\r\n  the profit thereof, and dictates prices through the world of the\r\n  first, or among the first, of the products of Pennsylvania, and of\r\n  the United States, and this to the impoverishment of thousands of\r\n  citizens, and the destruction of each of these interests within the\r\n  state. That this has been accomplished through and by means of the\r\n  co-operation of the Pennsylvania Railroad, its management and\r\n  influence, is matter of record.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO MONOPOLISE THE TRADE\r\n\r\n  was initiated by the conveyance, by R. D. Barclay, Thomas A. Scott’s\r\n  private secretary, and S. S. Moon, the legislative agent of the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, to a party composed principally of Cleveland\r\n  and New York men, headed by an agent of the New York Central and\r\n  Erie Railways, of a charter granted by the Legislature of\r\n  Pennsylvania for a different purpose, under which they organised for\r\n  the seizure of the petroleum trade, retaining the charter title of\r\n\r\n\r\n                    “THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY,”\r\n\r\n  the then managers thereof being the managers of the organisation now\r\n  known as the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  With the South Improvement Company, not a member of which lived in\r\n  the Oil Region, or was an owner of oil wells or oil lands, the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad hastened to execute a contract (January 18,\r\n  1872), giving it the sole and exclusive control of all petroleum\r\n  shipments thereon, regardless of ownership, and securing this by the\r\n  payment by the railroad of a rebate or drawback to the South\r\n  Improvement Company of such a sum as would have inevitably driven\r\n  all others out of the trade, and lest there might be doubt as to the\r\n  intent to so do, it was expressly stipulated in the fourth article\r\n  thereof that that was the result aimed at, and the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad therein bound itself, so far as it legally might, to aid in\r\n  accomplishing it.\r\n\r\n  The action of the Legislature and of Congress, and the uprising of\r\n  the people against this unparalleled iniquity, destroyed the\r\n  combination for the time being, the railroads having pledged\r\n  themselves to never attempt a similar outrage.\r\n\r\n  The local transportation of crude petroleum had been gradually\r\n  changing from movement by barrels to carriage in\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PIPE-LINES\r\n\r\n  from the wells to tankage located on the lines of railway, the\r\n  principal of which pipe-lines, at this time known as the\r\n  Pennsylvania Transportation Company (formerly Allegheny\r\n  Transportation Company), was under special charters of the\r\n  Legislature and owned and controlled by Messrs. Scott, of the\r\n  Pennsylvania, and Fisk and Gould, of the Erie Railways. The\r\n  Legislature had been petitioned at various times since 1866 to pass\r\n  a Free Pipe Law, but the various bills introduced for that purpose\r\n  could never overcome the opposition of the Pennsylvania Railroad in\r\n  the Legislature. During the excitement attendant upon the rise and\r\n  fall of the South Improvement Company scheme, the effort was\r\n  renewed, and the Legislature enacted a law, restricted to the eight\r\n  oil-producing counties, but the Pennsylvania Railroad influence was\r\n  strong enough to exclude Allegheny County from the operation of the\r\n  Act, thus shutting out Western Pennsylvania from Pittsburg, the\r\n  terminus of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the natural outlet of the Oil\r\n  Region, and the natural refining point of the United States.\r\n\r\n  The succeeding efforts to pass a Free Pipe Law, either general in\r\n  its nature or to permit construction of pipe-lines to lines of\r\n  railway within the state, or to include Allegheny County in the law\r\n  of 1872, have been defeated invariably by the opposition of the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, and the law of 1874, known as the Wallace\r\n  Act, was so framed and enacted as to leave it doubtful whether it\r\n  had not succeeded in withdrawing from the eight counties referred to\r\n  all the rights conceded to them by the Act of 1872, a wrong which no\r\n  subsequent Legislature has been able to redress.\r\n\r\n  Under the law of 1872, pipe-lines owned by citizens in the Oil\r\n  Region had been organised and were in operation, giving free access\r\n  to the railways, but after the passage of the Wallace Act (April 29,\r\n  1874), the Standard Combination, which had never really abandoned\r\n  the South Improvement scheme, systematically undertook their\r\n  destruction by forcing them into insolvency and then absorbing them.\r\n  This required railway co-operation, and various means were employed\r\n  therein, notably among which is the scheme adopted by the ring and\r\n  promulgated by the railroads October 1, 1874. An explanation is\r\n  necessary to understand why the railroads should unite: _First_, to\r\n  carry oil received by them through pipe-lines that had combined to\r\n  maintain a given rate for pipage twenty-two cents per barrel cheaper\r\n  than on oil received from pipe-lines not so combining, and _Second_,\r\n  to further weaken the refineries remaining in Western Pennsylvania\r\n  by depriving them of their geographical advantage of proximity to\r\n  the crude product, to the coal used as fuel, and to the exporting\r\n  ports by _free transportation_ of crude petroleum to the ring\r\n  refineries in other states. Various pipe-lines had already been\r\n  forced out of existence, had been bought up and united under the\r\n  name of “The United Pipe Lines,” which was owned, one-third by the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, one-third by the Lake Shore and New York\r\n  Central Railroads, and one-third by individuals who were members of\r\n  and directors in the Standard Oil Company. The Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  had as its particular feeder a similar organisation, known as the\r\n  “Empire Pipe Line.” This explains the _first_ point referred to\r\n  above. The _second_, so far as the Pennsylvania Railroad is\r\n  concerned, is inexplicable upon any ordinary hypothesis or under any\r\n  known theory in railroad politics. The scheme was a success,\r\n  pipe-lines one after another succumbed, and refiner after refiner\r\n  was bankrupted and his works absorbed.\r\n\r\n  This effected, the monopoly, backed by the New York railroads, in\r\n  one of which it exercised unlimited power, felt strong enough to\r\n  demand of the railroads that it should be given the future sole\r\n  conduct of the trade under the old South Improvement plan. Upon this\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad apparently awoke to its danger, resisted\r\n  the demand, and in July, 1877, President Scott announced as the\r\n  policy of the Pennsylvania Railroad open and free trade to all\r\n  shippers of petroleum. It was then conducting its oil traffic\r\n  through its ally, the Empire Transportation Company, which possessed\r\n  a system of pipe-lines (before referred to) extending over the Oil\r\n  Region, controlling a large portion of the production, with ample\r\n  tankage, with a large rolling stock upon the Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\n  and owning or controlling a refining capacity nearly equal to\r\n  one-half the consumption of the world. In the following month\r\n  (August, 1877), immediately after the riots at Pittsburg, which were\r\n  in their extent the natural outgrowth of railroad freight\r\n  discrimination against that city, the monopolists succeeded in\r\n  convincing the officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad that it was to\r\n  their or its interests to force the Empire Company, its cars, its\r\n  pipe-lines, its tankage and its refineries into their hands. The\r\n  people of Western Pennsylvania protested in a communication to the\r\n  president and directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad in September,\r\n  before the extent of the proposed iniquity had become fully known to\r\n  the public, which communication seems never to have reached the\r\n  board of directors. The outrage was finally consummated October 17,\r\n  1877, and the Pennsylvania Railroad was left without the control of\r\n  a foot of pipe-line together, a tank to receive, or a still to\r\n  refine a barrel of petroleum and without the ability to secure the\r\n  transportation of one except at the will of men who live and whose\r\n  interests lie in Ohio and New York.\r\n\r\n  Into those hands had now passed the last refineries of Pennsylvania,\r\n  the last means of transportation from the wells to the railroads,\r\n  and the last means of carriage to the markets of this country and of\r\n  the world. The South Improvement scheme (less its chartered\r\n  organisation as in 1872) was at last an accomplished fact, and in\r\n  the successful designing, prosecution, consummation and operation of\r\n  which it is impossible not to believe that railroad officials were\r\n  personally interested.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n  As the conspiracy was evidently gaining strength, the people of\r\n  Pennsylvania united in an effort to induce Congress to again\r\n  interfere as in 1872, and in 1876 it directed an investigation,\r\n  which was conducted in a dilatory manner by a committee, a prominent\r\n  member of the Standard Oil Company, and not a member of Congress,\r\n  presiding behind the seat of the chairman. Vice-President Cassatt,\r\n  of the Pennsylvania Railroad, was the only prominent railway\r\n  official who appeared in obedience to the subpœnas of the Speaker of\r\n  the House of Representatives, and he refused to give the committee\r\n  any information as to the matter under investigation, and the\r\n  counsel of the Pennsylvania Railroad, ex-Senator Scott, appeared\r\n  before the committee in justification of his so doing. The financial\r\n  officer of the Standard Oil Company appeared before the committee,\r\n  accompanied by a member of Congress—also a member of that Company,\r\n  and promptly refused to give the committee any information as to the\r\n  organisation, or the names of its members, or its relations with the\r\n  railroads. The influence and power of the combination was apparent;\r\n  the committee never reported, never complained of the contempt of\r\n  its witnesses, and all the evidence and record of its proceedings\r\n  effectively disappeared. In 1877–78, a bill was introduced by\r\n  Representative Watson, of Western Pennsylvania, seeking to prevent\r\n  discrimination in interstate commerce, which has been reported by a\r\n  committee, but which can hardly overcome the covert opposition which\r\n  it meets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        RECENT STATE LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n  All efforts to obtain a Free Pipe Law in this state having through a\r\n  series of years proved unavailing, although New York, in its efforts\r\n  to control the trade in Pennsylvania petroleum, had enacted such a\r\n  law, a bill was prepared enforcing in this state the Third and\r\n  Seventh Sections of the Seventeenth Article of its Constitution.\r\n  This bill, known as\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION ACT,\r\n\r\n  provided that shippers of property by car-load from any point on a\r\n  railroad within the state to any other point within the state,\r\n  should be charged equal rates and given equal facilities. Copies of\r\n  the proposed law were sent to the prominent railroad officials in\r\n  the state, but its provisions were so fair and protective to every\r\n  citizen of the state, and to every legitimate railroad interest,\r\n  that neither before the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, which\r\n  reported it favourably by an unanimous vote, nor in the Senate,\r\n  which passed it with but one dissenting voice, nor before the\r\n  Judiciary Committee of the House, which reported it unanimously, did\r\n  any railroad stockholder, official, or legislative agent appear to\r\n  offer an objection to its becoming a law. Yet it was killed in the\r\n  House by the familiar means employed by legislative agents in\r\n  disposing of measures objectionable, but not debatable. Had the bill\r\n  become a law, it would have rebuilt the refineries of the state,\r\n  with Philadelphia (whose petroleum trade under the monopoly has\r\n  gradually dwindled to a fraction of its former magnitude) as the\r\n  exporting point, with the Pennsylvania Railroad as the transporter\r\n  thereto, and the people of Western Pennsylvania might have arisen\r\n  from a community of miners, working for the benefit, and under the\r\n  rule, of a foreign corporation, to their former conditions as\r\n  citizens of a prosperous mining and manufacturing section of the\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n\r\n          RESULTS AND EFFECT OF THE SUCCESS OF THE CONSPIRACY\r\n\r\n  Upon or with the New York railroads no appeal or representation of\r\n  the people of this section would have any weight or influence. Their\r\n  managers reside in Cleveland and New York, and are subject to the\r\n  daily manipulations of the monopoly managers, while in our own\r\n  state, to all efforts for emancipation or toward the restoration of\r\n  trade to its natural channels the Pennsylvania Railroad and its\r\n  power is as a Chinese wall. Its president and vice-president admit\r\n  the preferences in rates given to the monopoly, and boldly announce\r\n  their intent to continue in so doing; they claim the legal right to\r\n  so do, and challenge resistance; they obstruct all efforts of\r\n  producers, shippers and refiners by delaying or restricting\r\n  facilities; by threatening other railroads with severance of\r\n  connections and deprivation of general traffic if they transport\r\n  petroleum for parties outside the monopoly; they refer applicants\r\n  for rates and facilities over the Pennsylvania Railroad to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, and offering their personal service as\r\n  negotiators for such rates and facilities, assure all that there is\r\n  no hope of success in the trade unless by a coalition with the\r\n  Standard.\r\n\r\n  We have thus far given not more than an outlined sketch of this\r\n  enormous monopoly, its plan, its growth, and its results. We have\r\n  not burdened your Excellency with details of individual oppression\r\n  and outrage, but we should fail to discharge our duties to ourselves\r\n  and as citizens if we neglect to recite some of the means by which\r\n  the most deplorable results are produced to our state and section.\r\n  Wrong is constantly perpetuated and right driven from us. True it is\r\n  that in many things the monopoly has been unwittingly aided in its\r\n  schemes by unwary concessions as to the management of its business,\r\n  by producers of petroleum themselves, but they had a right, as men\r\n  pursuing an honest calling, to believe that they were dealing with\r\n  honest men, and not with a gang of public plunderers, leagued\r\n  together by no better tie than the sordid desire of gain, to be\r\n  acquired by methods of corruption and lawlessness.\r\n\r\n  By the theory of the law, corporations derive their powers from the\r\n  people of the Commonwealth in General Assembly convened; they have\r\n  no powers not delegated to them by the people; they take nothing by\r\n  implication; they are public servants, invested for the public\r\n  benefit with extraordinary privileges, and their charters may be\r\n  taken from them when they cease to properly perform the duties of\r\n  their creation. The railroad and pipe-line companies are common\r\n  carriers of freight for all persons, are bound to receive it when\r\n  offered at convenient and usual places, and to transport it for all,\r\n  for reasonable compensation, without unreasonable discrimination in\r\n  favour of any. These are but simple statements of well established\r\n  legal principles, never doubted in any court, but affirmed by every\r\n  tribunal that has ever considered them. Yet the people who granted\r\n  these special privileges are now upon the defensive, their rights\r\n  denied by these corporations, and they are challenged to enter the\r\n  courts to establish them, while in the meantime they are inoperative\r\n  to the irreparable injury of their business. They have yielded to\r\n  the railways that they have created a part of their sovereignty, and\r\n  given them the right to take private property for public use, but\r\n  restricting such taking, strictly to such use. Yet where the narrow\r\n  strip of land used as a railway roadbed runs through valuable oil\r\n  lands, this combination is strong enough to demand from the railways\r\n  its transfer to them, that they may and do thereon sink their own\r\n  oil wells, and thereby drain the oil from the adjoining lands whose\r\n  owners gave the strip for public use by a railroad.\r\n\r\n  The owners of lands along the line of the Allegheny Valley Railroad,\r\n  producing petroleum from those lands, with their own pipe-line\r\n  running to their own shipping racks by the side tracks of that\r\n  railroad, are unable to obtain cars in which to load their product\r\n  for transportation, at any rate of freight, while their tanks\r\n  overflow. Shippers of petroleum are refused cars, or are promised\r\n  them, only to find the promises broken, and their contracts rendered\r\n  impossible of fulfillment, while the monopoly demands and is given\r\n  all the cars belonging to the railroads, it permitting its own\r\n  private cars to meantime stand idle, so that the railroads may\r\n  assert its inability to accommodate all.\r\n\r\n  Owners of tanks connected with the monopoly pipe-lines, with ample\r\n  storage therein for their own product, are refused transportation\r\n  from their own wells upon the ground that “their tanks are full,” a\r\n  barefaced and daily demonstrated falsehood. Other producers of\r\n  petroleum are refused transportation by the pipe-lines, on the plea\r\n  of want of capacity to carry, and at the same time are informed that\r\n  their oil will be carried if they will sell it to the ring,\r\n  “immediate shipment.”\r\n\r\n  If the applicant’s tanks are overflowing, or if he needs money and\r\n  complies with their terms, he is offered a price from two and a half\r\n  to twenty-five cents below the market value. If he accepts and sells\r\n  a fixed amount of his oil, the pipe-line removes all but five or ten\r\n  barrels, delays for days and weeks to take the remainder, and\r\n  refuses to pay for any until all is taken. This is known as the\r\n  “immediate shipment swindle.”\r\n\r\n  By their use of the petroleum of others stored in their tanks and\r\n  lines; by the overissue of Pipe Line Certificates; by refusal to\r\n  perform their public duties; by open defiance of the law and\r\n  impudent evasions of its provisions, the pipe-line and railroad\r\n  companies leave to the people, whose creatures they are, but two\r\n  remedies—an appeal for protection, first to the law of the land,\r\n  next to the higher law of nature!\r\n\r\n  These corporations have made themselves the interested tools of a\r\n  monopoly that has become the buyer, the carrier, the manufacturer,\r\n  and the seller of this product of immense value. It needs no\r\n  argument or illustration to convince that in such a position this\r\n  foreign corporation is in direct antagonism to the producer, the\r\n  labourer and the consumer.\r\n\r\n  The South Improvement conspiracy embraced in its scheme the\r\n  ownership of the oil-producing territory, wells and machinery. If\r\n  the present course of its successor cannot be stayed, it is merely a\r\n  question of time when the ownership of the entire oil production\r\n  will fall into its hands through the impoverishment of thousands of\r\n  our citizens and their inability to contend longer.\r\n\r\n  That monopolies are dangerous to free institutions is a political\r\n  maxim so old as to have lost its force by irrelevant repetition, but\r\n  if anything were needed to awaken the public sense to its truth, the\r\n  immediate effect of this giant combination is before us. Throughout\r\n  the Oil Region, as wherever it does business, it now has its own\r\n  acid works, glue factories, hardware stores and barrel works. We\r\n  have seen that it is master of the railroads, and owns and controls\r\n  all the refineries, all the pipe-lines. All these enumerated\r\n  industries controlled by them employ large numbers of labourers\r\n  dependent for the support of themselves and their families upon the\r\n  daily labour given or withheld by this powerful conspirator. At the\r\n  flash of the telegraphic message from Cleveland, Ohio, hundreds of\r\n  men have been thrown out of employment on a few hours’ notice and\r\n  kept for weeks in a state of semi-starvation and justifiable\r\n  discontent, deceived meanwhile with delusive promises of work, until\r\n  the autocrat of a foreign corporation, maintained and upheld by the\r\n  chief among Pennsylvania corporations, gives leave from within the\r\n  borders of a foreign state for the Pennsylvania labourer to earn his\r\n  bread.\r\n\r\n  Along the valley of Oil Creek and the Allegheny Valley, where a few\r\n  years since the smoke of busy refineries and their attendant\r\n  industries darkened the air, piles of rusted iron and heaps of\r\n  demolished brick work mark the results of the conspiracy; where a\r\n  few years since busy men crowded to and fro in the pursuit of lawful\r\n  trade in a great staple, there is now silence and emptiness. The\r\n  producer, once surrounded with competitive buyers of his product,\r\n  now goes with crowds of his fellow victims to wait his turn for\r\n  leave to sell it at a dictated price to a single agent of a single\r\n  purchaser.\r\n\r\n  To permit to stand unattacked the foul principles of such an\r\n  organisation, to permit them to be fastened as lawful or right upon\r\n  the policy of the Commonwealth or the nation, is to lay the\r\n  foundation for the exile of capital, endless injury to the public\r\n  interests, endless oppression of the labourer, riots, tumults, and\r\n  the decay of the state.\r\n\r\n  So far as this public wrong is within the scope of Executive\r\n  interference, we ask that immediate steps be taken to enforce by\r\n  legislative enactment the wise provisions of our State Constitution,\r\n  and by such legal processes as are necessary, compel obedience to\r\n  law and the performance by chartered companies of their public\r\n  duties.\r\n\r\n                       B.

That they\r\n  are so engaged by being associated together in the ownership of\r\n  several pipe-lines, such association being accomplished by the said\r\n  defendants being owners of shares of stock in incorporated\r\n  companies, to-wit: the United Pipe Line and American Transfer\r\n  Company, and interest in capital in limited partnerships, to-wit:\r\n  the Tidioute and Titusville Pipe Companies, Limited, and others,\r\n  which said companies, the said defendants, at the time of the\r\n  conspiracy and combination charged in the indictment, controlled,\r\n  and thereby controlled the transportation of crude petroleum from\r\n  wells and points of storage in said several counties and at the said\r\n  several localities.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—That the said defendants, and each of them, and the said\r\n  several corporations, firms, and limited partnerships, were and are\r\n  engaged by means of the ownership and control of said several firms,\r\n  limited partnerships, and corporations, and by means of ownership of\r\n  stock and interests therein, were and are engaged in the business of\r\n  storing crude petroleum in the said several localities, cities,\r\n  counties and states, by means of storage tanks, and said business\r\n  was carried on in said counties, each and all of them, by\r\n  themselves, personally, and also through agents acting by their\r\n  directions.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—That each one of the said defendants and all of them in\r\n  concert were engaged in the several kinds of business hereinbefore\r\n  referred to, by themselves and their agents in the county of\r\n  Clarion, and in the other places mentioned hereinbefore, during the\r\n  whole period of two years prior to the day upon which the indictment\r\n  was found against them in this case, and during that time by\r\n  themselves and their agents acting under their directions in the\r\n  said county of Clarion, combined, confederated and conspired\r\n  together to cheat and defraud numerous citizens of the county of\r\n  Clarion, to-wit: J. A. Vera, William L. Fox, and M. L. Lockwood, and\r\n  divers others, and to cheat and defraud the public by securing to\r\n  themselves a monopoly of the business and occupation of buying and\r\n  selling crude petroleum in the county of Clarion, and to prevent all\r\n  other persons engaged in said business, from making, receiving and\r\n  obtaining the fair value, profit, price and return from such\r\n  business, by fraudulent devices, practices and secret contrivances,\r\n  and among others the following:\r\n\r\n  _A._—Falsely pretending during the times aforesaid and at all times\r\n  that the storage tanks owned and controlled by them, and of which\r\n  they had the possession, measurement and accounts, were full of\r\n  crude petroleum to the extent of the capacity of said tanks, and\r\n  that the said defendants could not receive and store crude petroleum\r\n  from and for citizens of Clarion County and the other counties and\r\n  localities named, when in truth such representations and statements\r\n  were false, and thereby divers citizens lost oil and were compelled\r\n  to sell petroleum at less than the value thereof.\r\n\r\n  _B._—By representing to divers citizens of the county of Clarion\r\n  engaged in the business of producing, buying and selling petroleum,\r\n  and to divers other persons engaged in said business in the other\r\n  counties and localities named, that the said defendants were enabled\r\n  to receive and transport for said well owners, citizens and\r\n  producers of such petroleum, by reason of lack of capacity and\r\n  transportation facilities, when in fact said representations were\r\n  false, and thereby divers producers dealers and well owners were\r\n  compelled to sell petroleum at less than the value thereof.\r\n\r\n  _C._—That said defendants by themselves and their agents within the\r\n  county of Clarion, in the state of Pennsylvania, and at the other\r\n  counties, cities and localities, hereinbefore named, had the control\r\n  of the entire transportation of crude petroleum from the producing\r\n  wells and districts, and the control of storing of crude petroleum\r\n  produced, that they and the several firms and corporations of which\r\n  they were members, and their agents and the agents of said firms and\r\n  corporations acting under the direction of the said defendants\r\n  corruptly and oppressively used the power and control they so as\r\n  aforesaid held, to compel producers and owners of petroleum to sell\r\n  the same to them, the said defendants, their agents and the several\r\n  firms and corporations aforesaid and their agents, and to sell the\r\n  said crude petroleum at less than its value, and less than the\r\n  market price thereof.\r\n\r\n  _D._—That the said defendants and each of them, through the several\r\n  firms and corporations of which they were members, and by their\r\n  agents acting under their directions and the agents of the said\r\n  firms and corporations, corruptly and oppressively used the power so\r\n  acquired by them to enable them to become the sole buyers and\r\n  refiners of crude petroleum.\r\n\r\n  _E._—That among the means used to obtain control of the business of\r\n  transporting crude petroleum were the following:\r\n\r\n  _First._—The said defendants and the several firms and corporations\r\n  of which they were members laid iron pipes in the county of Clarion,\r\n  and the other counties and states named, under charters and\r\n  pretended charters from the state of Pennsylvania, pretending that\r\n  they so did for the purpose of transporting for the public petroleum\r\n  from the oil wells and producing districts, to the railroads, for\r\n  shipment to the seaboard, when in fact the said pipe-lines were not\r\n  laid for that purpose, but for the purpose of transporting oil for\r\n  the said defendants, and the said several firms and corporations of\r\n  which they were the members, and not for the public, and to enable\r\n  the said defendants and the said firms and corporations to dictate\r\n  the rate of freight to be charged to them by the railroad companies\r\n  engaged in the business of carrying petroleum as common carriers,\r\n  and to force the said railroad companies to charge a greater and\r\n  unreasonably high rate of freight to all others, and that this was\r\n  for the purpose of preventing citizens of Clarion County and the\r\n  public from engaging in the business of buying, selling and shipping\r\n  crude petroleum.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The said defendants, and their agents acting under their\r\n  directions, and the several firms and corporations of which they\r\n  were members also so acting, pretended and represented to the\r\n  several railroad companies engaged in the transportation of\r\n  petroleum, and to the agents and officers of said companies, that\r\n  they, the said defendants and the several firms and corporations of\r\n  which they were members, and in which they were interested,\r\n  controlled the shipments of said crude and refined petroleum, by\r\n  deliveries thereof to the said railroad companies, and that the said\r\n  defendants were enabled to withhold, and drive said traffic and\r\n  business from them.\r\n\r\n  Said representations were false, but by means thereof, they, the\r\n  said defendants, procured and obtained from said several railroad\r\n  companies enormous and unjust rebates, commissions and deductions\r\n  from the rates of freight charged to citizens of Clarion County and\r\n  the public. The Citizens of Clarion County and the public were\r\n  thereby prevented from engaging in the business of producing and\r\n  shipping crude petroleum.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—That on or about the thirtieth day of August, 1877, and\r\n  again on or about the seventeenth day of October, 1877, the said\r\n  defendants met together in the city of Philadelphia and then and\r\n  there agreed together that they would represent to the officers of\r\n  the Pennsylvania Railroad Company that they, the said defendants,\r\n  and the several firms and corporations of which they were members,\r\n  could and would control and guarantee to the said railroad company a\r\n  certain proportion of the carrying traffic of crude petroleum over\r\n  said railroad.\r\n\r\n  And on or about the same dates the said defendants further agreed\r\n  together and did represent to the officers of the New York, Lake\r\n  Erie and Western Railroad Company, and to the officers of the Erie\r\n  Railroad Company, and to Mr. Jewett, receiver of the Erie Railroad\r\n  Company, and to the officers of the New York Central and Hudson\r\n  River Railroad Company, and to the officers of the Atlantic and\r\n  Great Western Railroad Company, and to V. H. Devereux, receiver\r\n  thereof, and to the officers of the Michigan Southern and Lake Shore\r\n  Railroad Company, and to the officers of the Baltimore and Ohio\r\n  Railroad Company, that they the said defendants and the several\r\n  firms and corporations of which they were members, could and would\r\n  control and guarantee to each of them a certain proportion of the\r\n  carrying traffic of the crude petroleum over said railroads\r\n  respectively. But by reason thereof the said Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  Company and the Empire Transportation Company were induced to, and\r\n  did sell, transfer, mortgage and dispose of, to said defendants and\r\n  to the several corporations and firms of which they were members,\r\n  all of the pipe-lines, crude oil cars and transportation equipment\r\n  of which they had control or ownership in the Oil Regions of\r\n  Pennsylvania, including the county of Clarion, and all the\r\n  refineries, for refining crude petroleum, of which they had\r\n  ownership or control.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—The objects and purposes of said representations and said\r\n  transfer were to enable the said defendants to control the business\r\n  of buying and selling crude and refined petroleum, and the\r\n  transportation and storage thereof.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—That, as stated in the foregoing paragraphs, during the\r\n  greater part of the year of 1877, and for some time previously, the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad Company owned or controlled through its\r\n  shipping agents, the Empire Line, a full and complete system of\r\n  pipe-lines throughout the counties of Clarion, Armstrong and Butler,\r\n  known as the Empire Line, numerous and well appointed tank oil cars,\r\n  the shortest and best route to the seaboard over its own lines and\r\n  the Allegheny Valley Railroad, and other connecting lines, also\r\n  controlled large and complete refineries, situated in Pittsburg,\r\n  Philadelphia and New York, and was by these means a competitor with\r\n  the defendants and the several corporations owned by them, in the\r\n  business of piping, transporting, buying and refining crude oil,\r\n  enabling producers, citizens of Clarion County and elsewhere,\r\n  without difficulty, to have their oil piped and transported, and to\r\n  sell the same at enhanced prices, owing to competition. That the\r\n  defendants, combining and conspiring to monopolise the entire and\r\n  sole business of buying, selling and refining oil in Clarion County\r\n  and elsewhere, did demand of the Empire Line and the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad Company that they and each of them should abandon and\r\n  desist from the said business of buying, selling and refining oil,\r\n  and that the said railroad company and Empire Line should grant to\r\n  them exclusively large rebates and low or cheap rates of\r\n  transportation of oil, and by means of withdrawing and procuring\r\n  others to withdraw the transportation of crude and refined oil over\r\n  and along said Pennsylvania Railroad, and by means of the procuring\r\n  from other railroads exclusive rebates and low rates of freight for\r\n  transportation below a fair and just compensation for such\r\n  transportation did compel the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company and\r\n  the Empire Line to sell to said defendants, or to some of the\r\n  corporations controlled and owned by them, said pipe-line, tank cars\r\n  and refineries, to the injury of the producers of oil of Clarion\r\n  County and elsewhere, by depriving them of the benefit of\r\n  competition in buying, piping, storing or refining this crude oil.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—That the defendants and others combined and confederated\r\n  with them did conspire to monopolise the entire and exclusive\r\n  business of refining crude petroleum in Clarion County and elsewhere\r\n  by means of throwing quantities of refined oil on the market and\r\n  selling the same at less price than the fair market value of the\r\n  same in the vicinity of independent refiners in Clarion County and\r\n  elsewhere, and by means of such sales did compel such refineries to\r\n  sell out to companies with which defendants were connected, or to\r\n  abandon or quit the business of refining.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—That the said defendants did with others conspire\r\n  together to purchase all the pipe-lines for the transportation of\r\n  oil within the producing oil region and all the refineries for the\r\n  refining of oil, for the purpose of controlling the price of oil and\r\n  compelling the oil producers of Clarion County and elsewhere to sell\r\n  their oil to the said defendants at ruinous low rates far below the\r\n  value thereof and the price that could have been obtained for the\r\n  same in a competitive market.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—Although the said representations were false, the said\r\n  defendants and the several firms and corporations of which they were\r\n  members procured the control of the business of producing, buying\r\n  and selling crude petroleum, and of about ninety per cent. thereof\r\n  by following acts done in furtherance of the agreements aforesaid:\r\n\r\n  _A._—To buy only petroleum for immediate shipment from the wells of\r\n  producers. And when so bought they refused to remove it. It was so\r\n  bought at less than its value and market price, and the producers of\r\n  petroleum were compelled to sell the same by reason of the false\r\n  representations as to capacity, storage and transportation\r\n  hereinbefore fully set forth.\r\n\r\n  _B._—By giving themselves and procuring for themselves exorbitant\r\n  and unreasonable rebates, commissions and allowances from the\r\n  railroads and pipe-lines owned and controlled by them, which\r\n  rebates, commissions and allowance could not be procured by any\r\n  other than the said defendants and the several firms and\r\n  corporations of which they were members.\r\n\r\n  _C._—By impeding transportation by railroads, procuring them to\r\n  refuse and delay cars for shipment of petroleum, procuring the\r\n  breaking connections with connecting railroad lines, refusing and\r\n  procuring the refusal of railroad companies and pipe-lines to\r\n  receive and transport petroleum, by refusals and procuring refusals\r\n  to store petroleum, by refusing and procuring the refusal of\r\n  railroad companies to furnish side tracks, cars and transportation\r\n  facilities to pipe-line companies other than those of the defendants\r\n  and to individuals, by selling refined petroleum at less than the\r\n  cost of manufacture, by carrying and storing oil at less than the\r\n  cost of transportation and storage, by thereby forcing competing\r\n  lines to sell to them at a loss, by issuing certificates or accepted\r\n  orders of pipe-line companies in violation of law not representing\r\n  the petroleum in the custody of said corporations of the said\r\n  defendants, and placing such certificates upon the market, thereby\r\n  causing an apparent increase in the quantity of oil in the market\r\n  for sale and depressing the price of crude petroleum by making false\r\n  and fictitious reports of stock of petroleum in the custody of the\r\n  United Pipe Lines, a corporation of which the defendants are the\r\n  owners and which they control, by violating the laws relative to\r\n  making reports of business of the said pipe-line company; by\r\n  neglecting and refusing to make the required oath thereto, by\r\n  destroying refineries purchased by them at less than their value, of\r\n  those they had compelled to sell to them by the fraudulent acts\r\n  aforesaid, by hiring and paying salaries to men to remain out of\r\n  business for a term of years, and to act as spies for the said\r\n  defendants and the corporations and firms of which they are members;\r\n  by selling crude and refined petroleum at less than its cost to\r\n  them; by increasing the production by entering into agreements\r\n  relative to the price the said defendants and the corporations and\r\n  firms of which they were members; by threatening common carriers\r\n  with destruction of the business of carrying oil, if they carried\r\n  for others than themselves, and those associated with them, or\r\n  permitted other pipe-line companies to deliver petroleum to them, or\r\n  railroads to carry to them; by means of said threats to prevent the\r\n  building or operation of competing lines of pipe or railroad for\r\n  transportation of petroleum; by refusing to store petroleum in tanks\r\n  owned by individuals for them, and by filling such tanks with their\r\n  own oil, thereby causing a waste and loss both of petroleum and in\r\n  the price obtained; by refusals to the citizens of Clarion County\r\n  and elsewhere, at the several localities named, to transport or\r\n  store crude petroleum.\r\n\r\n  SECOND COUNT. All of the evidence hereinbefore offered in support of\r\n  the first count.\r\n\r\n  THIRD COUNT. All of the evidence hereinbefore stated to be offered\r\n  in support of the first and second counts, and, in addition thereto,\r\n  evidence of purchase of refineries under false representations; that\r\n  refiners were forced to sell by reasons of enormous rebates,\r\n  fraudulently obtained from railroad companies, as hereinbefore\r\n  stated, the business being thereby, and not otherwise, rendered\r\n  unprofitable to such refineries as could not obtain said rebates,\r\n  commissions and allowances, they being all in the said business,\r\n  except the said defendants, and the firms and corporations of which\r\n  they were members.\r\n\r\n  FOURTH COUNT. All the evidence hereinbefore stated to be offered in\r\n  support of the first, second and the third counts, and, in addition\r\n  thereto, that the said defendants and their agents diverted traffic\r\n  from the Allegheny Valley Railroad Company by threatening the said\r\n  company and those who were delivering petroleum to it for\r\n  transportation, with loss and injury to their business, and by\r\n  shipping themselves over other railroads, unless the said Allegheny\r\n  Valley Railroad Company would allow them exorbitant rebates,\r\n  commissions and allowances upon petroleum carried, that other\r\n  dealers and shippers could not obtain.\r\n\r\n  FIFTH COUNT. All the evidence hereinbefore stated to be offered in\r\n  support of the first, second, third and fourth counts, and, in\r\n  addition thereto, that the traffic was diverted from the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad Company, a common carrier, by the same means,\r\n  devices and threats as hereinbefore stated.\r\n\r\n  SIXTH, SEVENTH AND EIGHTH COUNTS. All the evidence hereinbefore\r\n  stated to be offered as the first, second, third, fourth and fifth\r\n  counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 35 (See page 1253)\r\n    CONTRACT OF PETROLEUM PRODUCERS’ UNION WITH STANDARD COMBINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From “A History of the Organisation, Purposes and Transactions of\r\n  the General Council of the Petroleum Producers’ Unions, and of the\r\n  Suits and Prosecutions instituted by it from 1878 to 1880,” pages\r\n  41–44.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Articles of agreement made the 29th day of January, 1880, by and\r\n  between the Standard Oil Company, a corporation of the state of\r\n  Ohio; the Standard Oil Company of Pittsburg, a corporation of the\r\n  state of Pennsylvania; the Imperial Refining Company (limited) of\r\n  Oil City, Pennsylvania; the Acme Oil Company of New York and\r\n  Pennsylvania; the Atlantic Refining Company of Philadelphia; the\r\n  American Transfer Company; the United Pipe Lines, a corporation of\r\n  Pennsylvania; the Devoe Manufacturing Company of New York; the\r\n  Eclipse Lubricating Oil Company (limited) of Franklin, Pennsylvania;\r\n  J.

That the said parties of the first part shall and will make no\r\n  opposition to an entire abrogation of the system of rebates,\r\n  drawbacks and secret rates of freight in the transportation of\r\n  petroleum on the railroads.\r\n\r\n  II. That said parties of the first part further agree that the\r\n  railroad companies may make known to the other shippers of petroleum\r\n  on their several roads all the rates of freight, and that said\r\n  parties of the first part or any of them will not receive any rebate\r\n  or drawback that the railroad companies are not at liberty to give\r\n  to other shippers of petroleum.\r\n\r\n  III. The said parties of the first part further agree that so far as\r\n  the said pipe-lines are concerned there shall be no discrimination\r\n  used or permitted by the said pipe-line companies between or against\r\n  their patrons; that the rates of pipage and storage shall be\r\n  reasonable, uniform, and equal to all parties, and shall not be\r\n  advanced except on thirty days’ notice; that to the extent of their\r\n  influence the United Pipe Lines and the other companies parties\r\n  hereto do agree that there shall be no difference in the price of\r\n  crude oil between one district and another, excepting such as may be\r\n  based upon a difference in quality, to be determined by tests; that\r\n  the said pipe-lines will make every reasonable effort to receive,\r\n  transport, store and deliver all oil tendered them, and will\r\n  receive, transport, store and deliver all oil so tendered so long as\r\n  the production does not exceed an average of sixty-five thousand\r\n  barrels per day during fifteen (15) consecutive days, unforeseen\r\n  emergencies and unavoidable accidents excepted, and if the\r\n  production shall exceed the amount stated, and also the storage\r\n  capacity of the pipe-lines, the parties of the first part, buyers of\r\n  oil, agree that they will not purchase any so-called immediate\r\n  shipment oil, at a lower price than the price of certificate oil,\r\n  provided that the owners of immediate shipment oil in the Oil Region\r\n  do not sell to any other party or parties at a lower price.\r\n\r\n  IV. And all the parties of the first part further agree that until\r\n  the production of oil reaches the daily maximum of sixty-five\r\n  thousand barrels as aforesaid, certificates or other vouchers will\r\n  be given for all oil taken into the custody of the pipe-lines and\r\n  the transfer of such certificates or other vouchers in the usual\r\n  manner shall be considered as a delivery of the oil mentioned\r\n  therein as between the pipe-lines and the seller, subject to the\r\n  provisions of such certificate or other vouchers.\r\n\r\n  In consideration of the agreement hereinbefore set forth, and of the\r\n  execution thereof by the first parties, the said second parties do\r\n  hereby agree as follows:\r\n\r\n  That the Governor and Attorney-General of the Commonwealth of\r\n  Pennsylvania shall be requested by them within ten days of the\r\n  execution hereof, to enter a motion to dismiss the bill filed by the\r\n  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the United Pipe Lines and\r\n  others at Number 309, October and November term, 1878, in the\r\n  Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, and the proceedings by _quo warranto_\r\n  Number 12, November term, 1878, in Venango County, and will do all\r\n  that may be lawfully done to have the same dismissed of record.

B. Campbell, representing the oil\r\n  producers, at whose instance such bills were filed, and Thomas A.\r\n  Scott as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, the said\r\n  bills were withdrawn; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, In said agreement the Pennsylvania Railroad Company\r\n  agreed, upon the withdrawal of said bills, that it would enter into\r\n  written contracts with the said B. B. Campbell, representing said\r\n  producers, and all such producers as should within sixty days after\r\n  the date of said agreement signify their assent to said agreement by\r\n  signature to the same or duplicate thereof, which contracts should\r\n  stipulate as therein mentioned, and as hereinafter provided; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, On the twenty-fifth of February, 1880, the board of\r\n  directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company approved the action\r\n  of the president in signing said agreement, and authorised the\r\n  president or one of the vice-presidents to execute such further and\r\n  formal agreements as might be deemed necessary to carry out the\r\n  terms of said agreement,\r\n\r\n  _Now therefore_, this agreement witnesseth, That in consideration of\r\n  the premises, and other good and valuable considerations to them\r\n  thereunto moving, it is covenanted and agreed between the parties\r\n  hereto as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n  _First_, That the Pennsylvania Railroad Company shall and will make\r\n  known to all shippers of petroleum and its products all the rates of\r\n  freight intended to be charged to all shippers upon such petroleum\r\n  and its products.\r\n\r\n  _Second_, That the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company shall not and\r\n  will not pay or allow any shipper of petroleum or its products any\r\n  rebate, drawback or commission upon the shipments of such petroleum\r\n  or products different from or greater than that which shall be paid\r\n  to any other person shipping or offering to ship like quantity; and\r\n  that any discrimination that may be made in favour of shippers of\r\n  the large quantities shall be reasonable, and shall, upon demand\r\n  made, be communicated to all persons shipping, or who are now or may\r\n  be hereafter engaged in the business and desire to ship petroleum\r\n  and its products.\r\n\r\n  _Third_, That the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company further agrees\r\n  that upon its own road, and upon any other road or roads upon which\r\n  it shall furnish cars and engage in the business of a common carrier\r\n  of petroleum and its products, it will not practise any\r\n  discrimination in the distribution of its cars, but will make fair\r\n  apportionment in such distribution among all applicants for cars\r\n  having actually in their custody and ready for shipment at the time\r\n  of their application the petroleum or products for the shipment of\r\n  which they ask facilities.\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the individuals parties hereto have hereunto\r\n  set their hands and seals, and the said Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  Company has caused its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed, duly\r\n  attested, the day and year first above written.\r\n\r\n  The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, by\r\n\r\n                                              THOMAS A.

Early in the fall of 1878 General Haupt reported\r\nthat his right of way was complete from the Allegheny River to\r\nBaltimore; contracts were let for the telegraph line and preparation\r\nbegun to lay the pipe. Before much actual work had been done it became\r\nclear to the company that it was not from the Butler oil field but from\r\nthat of Bradford that a seaboard pipe-line should run; that the former\r\nfield was showing signs of exhaustion, while the latter was evidently\r\ngoing to yield abundantly. With a promptness which would have done\r\ncredit to Mr. Rockefeller himself, Messrs. Benson, Hopkins and McKelvy\r\nchanged their plan. The new idea was to lay a six–inch line from\r\nRixford, in the Bradford field, to Williamsport, on the Reading\r\nRailroad, a distance of 109 miles. The Reading, not having had so far\r\nany oil freight, was happy to enter into a contract with them to run oil\r\nto both Philadelphia and New York until they could get through to the\r\nseaboard themselves. In November, 1878, a limited partnership, called\r\nthe Tidewater Pipe Company, was organised with a capital of $625,000 to\r\ncarry out the scheme. Many of the best known producers of the Oil\r\nRegions took stock in the company, the largest stockholders being A. A.\r\nSumner and B. D. Benson.[86]\r\n\r\nThe first work was to get a right of way. The company went at the work\r\nwith secrecy and despatch. Its first move was to buy from the Equitable\r\nPipe Line, the second independent effort to which, as we have seen, the\r\nProducers’ Union lent its support in 1878, a short line it had built,\r\nand a portion of a right of way eastward which Colonel Potts had been\r\nquietly trying to secure. This was a good start, and the chief engineer,\r\nB. F. Warren, pushed his way forward to Williamsport near the line which\r\nColonel Potts had projected. The Standard, intent on stopping them, and\r\nindeed on putting an end to all future ventures of this sort, set out at\r\nonce to get what was called a “dead line” across the state. This was an\r\nexclusive right for pipe-line purposes from the northern to the southern\r\nboundary of Pennsylvania. As there was no free pipe-line bill in those\r\ndays, this “dead line,” if it had been complete, would have been an\r\neffectual barrier to the Tidewater. Much money was spent in this sordid\r\nbusiness, but they never succeeded in completing a line. The Tidewater,\r\nafter a little delay, found a gap not far from where it wanted to cross,\r\nand soon had pushed itself through to Williamsport. With the actual\r\nlaying of the pipe there was no interference which proved serious,\r\nthough the railroads frequently held back shipments of supplies. At\r\nWilliamsport, where the pipe crossed under the railroad, it was torn out\r\nonce. The Tidewater had no trouble in this case in getting an injunction\r\nwhich prevented further lawlessness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALANSON A.

The plant which\r\nthey had constructed proposed to transport 10,000 barrels of oil a day\r\nover a distance of 109 miles. The apparatus for doing this consisted\r\nsimply of tanks, pumps and pipes. At Coryville, on the edge of the\r\nBradford field, two iron tanks, each holding 25,000 barrels of oil, were\r\nconnected with an enormous pump of a new pattern devised by the Holly\r\nCompany especially for this work. This pump, which was driven by an\r\nengine of seventy horse-power, was expected to force the oil through a\r\nsix–inch pipe to a second station twenty-eight miles away and about 700\r\nfeet higher. Here a second pump took up the oil again, driving it to the\r\nsummit of the Alleghanies, a few miles east. From this point the oil ran\r\nby gravitation to Williamsport.\r\n\r\nIt was announced that the pumps would be started on the morning of May\r\n28. The experiment was watched with keenest interest. Up to that time\r\noil had never been pumped over thirty miles, and no great elevation had\r\nbeen overcome. Here was a line 109 miles long, running over a mountain\r\nnearly 2,600 feet high. It was freely bet in the Oil Regions that the\r\nTidewater would get nothing but a drizzle for its pains. However, oil\r\nmen, Standard men, representatives of the Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\nnewspaper men and natives gathered in numbers at the stations, and\r\nindeed all along the route, to watch the result.\r\n\r\nThe pump at station one was started by B. D. Benson, the president of\r\nthe company. There were present with him several members of the concern,\r\nand to-day these men speak with emotion of the moment when Mr. Benson\r\nopened the valve to admit the oil to the pump. Would the great venture,\r\non which they had staked all, be a success? Without a hitch the oil\r\nflowed in a full stream into the pipe and began its long journey over\r\nthe mountains. It travelled about as fast as a man could walk and, as\r\nthe pipe lay on the ground, the head of the stream could be located by\r\nthe sound. Patrolmen followed the pipe the entire length watching for\r\nleaks. There was now and then a delay from the stopping of the pumps;\r\nbut the cause was trivial enough, never anything worse than chips under\r\nthe valves or clogging in the pipe by stones and bits of wood which the\r\nworkmen had carelessly left in when joining the pipe. When the oil\r\nreached the second station there was general rejoicing; nevertheless,\r\nthe steepest incline, the summit of the Alleghanies, had yet to be\r\novercome. The oil went up to the top of the mountain without difficulty,\r\nand on June 4, the seventh day after Mr. Benson opened the valve at\r\nStation One, oil flowed into the big receiving tank beyond Williamsport.\r\nA new era had come in the oil business. Oil could be pumped over the\r\nmountains. It was only a matter of time when the Tidewater would pump to\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nOnce at the seaboard, the Tidewater had a large and sure outlet for its\r\noil in the group of independent refiners left at the mercy of the\r\nStandard in the fall of 1877 by the downfall of the Empire Line. These\r\nrefiners had most of them run the entire gamut of experiences forced on\r\nthe trade by the railroads and the Standard. Take, for instance, the\r\nexperience of Ayres, Lombard and Company, related by Josiah Lombard in\r\n1879 in the Pennsylvania suits. They had gone into the business in 1869\r\nin West Sixty-sixth street. At the beginning they had shipped\r\nprincipally over the Erie, sometimes as high as 50,000 barrels a month;\r\nbut when that road came into the hands of Fisk and Gould those gentlemen\r\nbegan to try to build up a refining business in New York for their own\r\nfriends. Edward Stokes was at that time hand in glove with Fisk; he had\r\nin the Oil Regions an able friend, Henry Harley. Harley bought and\r\nshipped the oil over the Erie; special rates were given him, and the\r\nStokes refinery soon began to flourish at the expense of the former\r\nshippers of the Erie. Mr. Lombard finding, as he says, that there was no\r\npossibility of doing business with that road under the Fisk and Gould\r\nmanagement, went over to the New York Central. Here he furnished his own\r\ncars. Ayres, Lombard and Company owned 100 cars on the Central in 1872,\r\nworth about $35,000, and in these they shipped the bulk of their oil.\r\nThe South Improvement Company manœuvres in the spring of 1872 completely\r\nstopped their shipping over that road and in 1872 they sold their cars.\r\nMr. Lombard said in his testimony: “We sold them (the cars) because the\r\nStandard Oil Company were getting the ascendency so much over the New\r\nYork roads that we could not get a rate of freight from the lower\r\ndistricts and the Parker district, where the bulk of the oil was\r\nproduced at that time, that would enable us to compete with them in the\r\nNew York market, so there was no use in owning the cars.”\r\n\r\nDriven off the Erie and Central, the firm made a running arrangement\r\nwith Mr. Rockefeller for a year; the Standard bought the cars and agreed\r\nto furnish Ayres, Lombard and Company crude oil for a certain price at a\r\ncertain time, and take the refined oil from them at a fixed price. This\r\ncontract was made probably under the Refiners’ Association which Mr.\r\nRockefeller succeeded in effecting in August, 1872, after the failure of\r\nthe South Improvement Company, which association, as we have already\r\nseen, took in fully four-fifths of the refining interests of the\r\ncountry. The contract continued, Mr. Lombard said in testimony, for a\r\nyear or more, and was then terminated by notice from the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. Soon after the termination of the contract with the Standard,\r\nwhich was either late in 1873 or early in 1874 (Mr. Lombard was not able\r\nto decide this when he was under examination), the firm began shipping\r\nover the Pennsylvania road. They bought part of their oil at this time\r\nfrom Adnah Neyhart. Now, sometime in 1875, as we have seen, Mr. Neyhart\r\nbegan to feel the Standard pressure and his business was sold to the\r\nStandard. Again Ayres, Lombard and Company found a large part of their\r\nsupply of oil cut off. For about a year they shipped over the\r\nPennsylvania. It was not long, however, before the concern found that\r\neven on the Pennsylvania they were under a disadvantage, that road\r\nhaving made in 1875 discriminating contracts with the Standard. Again\r\nthe firm changed, buying its oil from J. A. Bostwick and Company of New\r\nYork. Now Bostwick was the Standard Oil buyer, one of the original South\r\nImprovement Company, and a stockholder in the Standard Oil Company. Mr.\r\nLombard swore that he had not been taking oil of Bostwick for more than\r\na year before the Standard began to draw its lines around him, as he put\r\nit, and again the question arose how were they to get oil for their\r\nrefinery. There seemed no way but to try to make a contract with the\r\nPennsylvania Company. On the 18th of May, 1877, he went to Philadelphia\r\nand saw Colonel Potts, who told him he would be glad to have his\r\nshipments on the Pennsylvania. Accordingly a contract was made for a\r\nyear, the company guaranteeing them as low a rate as anybody else had.\r\nBut this contract of Mr. Lombard was destined to end as speedily and as\r\ndisastrously as all of those he had been making for over five years, for\r\nin the fall of the year the Empire Line was sold to the Standard, and in\r\nthe spring of 1878, when Mr. Lombard’s contract ran out, the\r\nPennsylvania refused to renew it on the terms they gave the Standard.\r\nMr. Lombard gave a very interesting account of the interview he and his\r\nfellow refiners of New York had with Mr. Cassatt in reference to this\r\nmatter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “In March, 1878, I think it was by appointment, we had an interview\r\n  with Mr. Cassatt, third vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad.\r\n  There were present Mr. Bush, Mr. Gregory, Mr. Burke, Mr. Ohlen, and\r\n  myself, besides Mr. Cassatt. It was held in Mr. Bush’s office, 123\r\n  Pearl street, New York. We sought that interview for the purpose of\r\n  finding out what our position would be on the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  after the termination of our contract with the Empire Line, which\r\n  they had assumed. We had quite a plain talk on the subject. We began\r\n  by telling Mr. Cassatt something that he already knew—that we for\r\n  the past year had been probably the largest shippers over the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad that they had had; largest shippers of\r\n  petroleum. He acknowledged it, and we asked him if we should, after\r\n  the first of May, be on the same footing and have as low a rate of\r\n  freight as anybody else, which was guaranteed by contract up to that\r\n  time. He said no, we would not. We asked him why not. Well, he said,\r\n  it would not be satisfactory to the Standard Oil Company. I then put\r\n  the question to him what difference it made to the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad Company whether it was satisfactory to the Standard Oil\r\n  Company or not. He said that the Standard Oil Company was the only\r\n  party which could keep peace between the trunk lines. I said, It\r\n  seems to me you have the matter very much in your own hands; there\r\n  are but four of you; if you agree upon a certain rate of freight the\r\n  oil is to come forward at, I see no use of the intervention of a\r\n  third party or a fifth party in this case. He said, I cannot\r\n  trust—or rather, he said, They are the only people that can keep\r\n  harmony. Then we had a little discussion about the rates. He said\r\n  that they had been bringing oil for the past year at a very low\r\n  rate. I told him I understood it was a little over seventy cents an\r\n  average on crude petroleum. He denied it, and said it was not. Then\r\n  when we were talking about the subject of rates, he said of course\r\n  the rates on petroleum were very profitable, and said we could find\r\n  out the rate at which they could bring petroleum, if they were\r\n  compelled to, by looking up their annual report, and seeing the cost\r\n  a ton per mile, which was something like five or six mills per ton\r\n  per mile, and which if we figured that it would be a very profitable\r\n  business. We told him we did not object to him making a good profit\r\n  at any time; all we wished was to have as low a rate of freight as\r\n  anybody else had, which we could not get.\r\n\r\n  “He said we had better make an arrangement with the Standard and we\r\n  would all of us make money, and that they had a very large business\r\n  and proposed to make money, and the discrimination would be so light\r\n  against us that we would hardly notice it, and we formed the idea\r\n  from what he said. We asked him whether the discrimination against\r\n  us would be larger if the rate of freight were high than it would if\r\n  the rate of freight were low. He said, yes, it would be, but he said\r\n  the discrimination would be very small. We tried to find out by\r\n  asking what it would be, but did not succeed. He then said if we\r\n  would unite with the Standard we would do better and everything\r\n  would be peaceable and harmonious, and he would use his efforts to\r\n  promote such a union if we wished it. We told him we did not wish to\r\n  unite with the Standard; we dealt on freight matters with the\r\n  Pennsylvania Railroad, not with the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  “There was another interview at which Mr. Bush, Mr. Ohlen, Mr.\r\n  Cassatt, and myself were the only parties as I remember it; it was\r\n  held in Pennsylvania, at the office of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\n  Company, in the last part of May or early part of June; it was at\r\n  the time of what we called the squeeze in cars. Previous to that\r\n  time we had had all the cars we wanted without any difficulty; at\r\n  that time and when we were wanting just about the same kind of cars\r\n  we had previously been wanting, and business was running on very\r\n  easily, we found we were unable to get anything like the amounts we\r\n  had before; instead of getting for the firm I represented from\r\n  twelve to fifteen cars a day, we were getting only one or\r\n  two—utterly insufficient for the business. We came over to see Mr.\r\n  Cassatt about it—Mr. Bush, Mr. Ohlen, and myself. He said he knew\r\n  there was trouble; that the other side, the Standard Oil Company,\r\n  had some five hundred cars full here at Philadelphia and Baltimore;\r\n  that he had not discovered it until recently, but that he would have\r\n  it remedied. They had been holding them here full. I asked him why,\r\n  if he knew of the cars being detained, he kept giving them cars. He\r\n  said he did not know exactly how that was. I told him if these cars\r\n  were shipped here and held, it seemed to me they ought to stop\r\n  giving cars to parties holding them. He said the matter would be\r\n  remedied soon. We asked him how soon. He could not tell exactly. I\r\n  said, ‘Can’t you stop giving them cars?’ He said he would remedy the\r\n  matter, we should have all the cars we needed; and it was at that\r\n  time that he made the remark to which Mr. Bush testified, when we\r\n  had some little general conversation, that if we built a pipe-line\r\n  he would buy it up for old iron in sixty days. I think I remarked\r\n  that the Conduit Pipe brought a good price for old iron, in a\r\n  laughing way. The interview was pleasant enough. Then early in\r\n  July—I think it was the last part of June or early part of July—Mr.\r\n  Ohlen, Mr. Bush, Mr. Wilson, Mr. King, Mr. Gregory, and myself came\r\n  to Philadelphia and met Colonel Scott, president of the Pennsylvania\r\n  Railroad, Mr. Cassatt and Mr. Brundred at the office of the\r\n  Pennsylvania road, with the same trouble, the same two troubles as\r\n  of old, a scarcity of cars and a discrimination in freight. As to\r\n  scarcity of cars, they claimed that we were getting our allotment.\r\n  We told them we knew nothing about an allotment, that previous to\r\n  the first of May we had sufficient cars for our business; since that\r\n  time we got scarcely any; that if they had not sufficient cars to do\r\n  the business with we would put on cars. Mr. Scott said they would\r\n  not allow that, they had bought out one line and did not propose to\r\n  have another; we then demanded cars for the business, making again\r\n  the offer to put on cars if they could not furnish them, with the\r\n  same result. He said they had already fought one fight in our behalf\r\n  which cost them a million and a half of dollars. We told them not at\r\n  all in our behalf, we had nothing to do with it; we were simply\r\n  shippers over the road and did not participate in the matter at all;\r\n  it was a matter of their own. He seemed to be a little sore about\r\n  that. When he made the remark which has been given in evidence\r\n  before, he said there would be no peace or profit in the business\r\n  until we made some arrangement with the Standard Oil Company; he\r\n  would be very glad to have such an arrangement made, and would do\r\n  all in his power to accomplish it. We told him we did not wish any\r\n  arrangement with the Standard Oil Company; we had been dealing for\r\n  years with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and we wished to deal\r\n  with them now on all transportation and freight matters. I think\r\n  there was nothing further in that interview.\r\n\r\n  “He asked why we did not apply to the other roads for\r\n  transportation. We told him we had. He said, with what results? That\r\n  the Central Road had no cars of their own. He said that was a very\r\n  flimsy pretext. I said that the Erie road cars were controlled by\r\n  the Standard Oil Company, and the Central cars were controlled by\r\n  the Standard Oil Company. That in fact the whole transportation of\r\n  the oil country seemed to be controlled by the Standard Oil Company,\r\n  and the New York Central, and the Erie, and the Pennsylvania\r\n  Central, and the Baltimore and Ohio, they controlled the whole\r\n  thing, and there was no chance, and in addition to that we had been\r\n  shippers and customers of the Pennsylvania road for years.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, men who had been through such experiences as these of\r\nMr. Lombard were glad to unite with the Tidewater, which promised to\r\nfree them from the railroads and their chief competition, and they\r\npromised to take all their supply from the line.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Tidewater experiment brought Mr. Rockefeller face to\r\nface with a new situation. Just how serious this situation was is shown\r\nby the difference in the cost of transporting a barrel of oil to the\r\nseaboard by rail and transporting it by pipe. According to the\r\ncalculation of Mr. Gowen, the president of the Reading Railroad, the\r\ncost by rail was at that time from thirty-five to forty-five cents. The\r\nopen rate was from $1.25 to $1.40, and the Standard Oil Company probably\r\npaid about eighty-five cents, when the roads were not protecting it from\r\n“injury by competition.” Now, according to General Haupt’s calculation\r\nin 1876, oil could be carried in pipes from the Oil Regions to the\r\nseaboard for 16⅔ cents a barrel. General Haupt calculated the average\r\ndifference in cost of the two systems to be twenty-three cents, enough\r\nto pay twenty-eight per cent. dividends on the cost of a line even if\r\nthe railway put their freights down to cost. This little calculation is\r\nenough to show that the day of the railroads as long-distance\r\ntransporters of crude oil was over; that the pipe-lines were bound to\r\nreplace them. Now, Mr. Rockefeller had by ten years of effort made the\r\nroads his servant; would he be able to control the new carrier? A man of\r\nlesser intellect might not have foreseen the inevitableness of the new\r\nsituation; a man of lesser courage would not have sprung to meet it. Mr.\r\nRockefeller, however, is like all great generals: he never fails to\r\nforesee where the battle is to be fought; he never fails to get the\r\nchoice of positions. He wasted no time now in deciding what should be\r\ndone. He proposed not merely to control future long-distance oil\r\ntransportation; he proposed to own it outright.\r\n\r\nHardly had the news of the success of the Tidewater’s experiment reached\r\nthe Standard before this truly Napoleonic decision was being carried\r\nout. Mr. Rockefeller had secured a right of way from the Bradford field\r\nto Bayonne, New Jersey, and was laying a seaboard pipe-line of his own.\r\nAt the same time he set out to acquire a right of way to Philadelphia,\r\nand soon a line to that point was under construction. Even before these\r\nseaboard lines were ready, pipes had been laid from the Oil Regions to\r\nthe Standard’s inland refining points—Cleveland, Buffalo and Pittsburg.\r\nWith the completion of this system Mr. Rockefeller would be independent\r\nof the railroads as far as the transportation of crude oil was\r\nconcerned. It was, of course, a new department in his business, and, to\r\nmanage it, a new company was organised in April, 1881—the National\r\nTransit Company—with a capital of five million dollars, and a charter of\r\nhistorical interest, for it was a mate of the charter of the ill-fated\r\nSouth Improvement Company, granted by the same Legislature and giving\r\nthe same omnibus privileges—the right in fact to do any kind of\r\nbusiness, except banking, in any part of the world. The South\r\nImprovement Company charter, as we have seen, was repealed. The charter\r\nwhich the National Transit Company now bought seems to have gone into\r\nhiding when the character of its mate was disclosed and so had been\r\nforgotten. How it came to be unearthed by the Standard or what they paid\r\nfor it, the writer does not know. However, as H. H. Rogers aptly told\r\nthe Industrial Commission in 1899, when he was asked if a considerable\r\nsum was not given for it: “I should suppose every good thing had to be\r\npaid for; I should say a man owning a charter of that kind would sell it\r\nat the best price he could get.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BYRON D.

BROWN\r\n\r\n  The present president of the Tidewater, successor to Mr. McKelvy.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnd while Mr. Rockefeller was making this lavish expenditure of money\r\nand energy to meet the situation created by the bold development of the\r\nTidewater, what was his attitude toward that company? One would suppose\r\nthat Mr. Rockefeller, of all men, would be the first to acknowledge the\r\nservice the Tidewater had rendered the oil business; that in this case\r\nhe would have felt an obligation to make an exception to his claim that\r\nthe oil business was his; that he would have allowed the new company to\r\nlive. But Mr. Rockefeller’s commercial vision is too keen for that; that\r\nwould _not_ be business. The Tidewater had been built to feed a few\r\nindependent refineries in New York. If these refineries operated outside\r\nof him, they might disturb his system; that is, they might increase the\r\noutput of refined and so lower its price. The Tidewater must not be\r\nallowed to live, then. But how could it be put out of commission? It had\r\nmoney to operate. There were plenty of oil producers glad to give it\r\ntheir product, because it was independent. The Reading Railroad had gone\r\nheart and soul into its fight—it had refiners pledged to take its oil,\r\nand these refiners had markets of their own at home and abroad. What was\r\nhe going to do about it? There were several ways to accomplish his end;\r\nin two of them, at least, Mr. Rockefeller excelled from long practice.\r\nThe first was to get out of the way the refineries which the Tidewater\r\nexpected to feed, and this was undertaken at once. The refiners were\r\napproached usually by members of the Standard Oil Company as private\r\nindividuals, and terms of purchase or lease so generous made to them\r\nthat they could not afford to decline. At the same time they were\r\nassured confidentially that the Tidewater scheme was a pure chimera,\r\nthat they understood the pipe-line business better than anybody else and\r\nthey knew oil could not be pumped over the mountains. All but one firm\r\nyielded to the pressure. Ayres and Lombard stood by the Tidewater, but\r\nsoon after their refusal to sell they were condemned as a public\r\nnuisance and obliged to move their works! The Tidewater met the\r\nsituation by beginning to build refineries of its own—one at Bayonne,\r\nNew Jersey, and another near Philadelphia—in the meantime storing the\r\noil it had expected to sell.\r\n\r\nHaving done his best to cut off his rival’s outlet, Mr. Rockefeller\r\ncalled upon the railroads to carry out that article of their contract\r\nwith him which bound them to protect him from “injury by competition.”\r\nWhat was done was told a few months later to the Committee on Commerce\r\nin the House of Representatives by Franklin B. Gowen, the president of\r\nthe Reading Railroad. According to Mr. Gowen the Tidewater and Reading\r\nwere no sooner ready to run oil than a meeting of the trunk lines was\r\nheld at Saratoga, at which the representatives of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany were present, and on that day the through rate on oil was\r\nreduced to twenty cents per barrel to the Standard Oil Company. “It was\r\nsubsequently reduced to fifteen cents,” Mr. Gowen told the Committee,\r\n“and I believe, though I do not certainly know, to ten cents per barrel\r\nin cars of the Standard Oil Company; ... and I am told that at the\r\nmeeting at Saratoga a time was fixed by the Standard Oil Company within\r\nwhich they promised to secure the control of the pipe-line—provided the\r\ntrunk lines would make the rate for carrying oil so low that all\r\nconcerned in transportation would lose money.\r\n\r\n“I know this, that only three or four months ago we were told—I do not\r\nmean myself, but the gentlemen who directly represented the pipe-line\r\nwhich leads to our road—that if they would agree to give all their oil\r\nto the Standard Oil Company to be refined, we could carry 10,000 barrels\r\na day, and the rates would be advanced by the trunk lines. But, to use\r\nthe language of those making the offer, ‘we’ (meaning the Standard Oil\r\nCompany) ‘will never permit the trunk lines to advance the rate on oil\r\nuntil your pipe-line gives us all its product to refine,’ and the\r\nprophesy of four months ago has become the history of to-day.” Mr.\r\nFlagler differs with Mr. Gowen in his explanation of this cut in rates.\r\nMr. Flagler contends that the Standard Oil Company really opposed it,\r\nbut that the railroads insisted on it. Mr. Flagler’s testimony is\r\ninteresting reading in connection with all that we know about the\r\nTidewater Company. It will be found in the appendix.[87]\r\n\r\nThis was the Tidewater’s first year’s experience. The second and third\r\nwere not unlike it. But the company lived and expanded. It bought and\r\nbuilt refineries, it sent its president to Europe to open markets, it\r\nextended its pipe-line still nearer to the seaboard, and it did this by\r\na series of amazingly plucky and adroit financial moves—borrowing money,\r\nspeculating in oil, exchanging credit, chasing checks from bank to bank,\r\n“hustling,” in short, as few men ever did to keep a business alive. And\r\nevery move had to be made with caution, for the Standard’s eye was\r\nalways on them, its hand always outstretched. Samuel Q. Brown, the\r\npresent president of the organisation, when on the witness stand in\r\nDecember, 1882, said that so much did the Tidewater fear espionage that\r\nthey were accustomed to keep their oil transactions as a private and not\r\na general account, in order that they might not be reported to the\r\nStandard; that even matters which they believed they were keeping in an\r\nabsolutely private way frequently leaked out, to the injury of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scale—3 miles to each division. CONDENSED PROFILE OF TIDEWATER PIPE\r\n    LINE BETWEEN RIXFORD AND TAMANEND, PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n  The pipe followed the jagged line representing surface of the ground.\r\n    The numbers above the surface line show the location of the pumping\r\n    stations from which the oil was forced. The pump at Station 1 lifted\r\n    the oil over 600 feet. From here it flowed by gravitation until the\r\n    gradient line—the sloping straight line above the surface\r\n    line—touched the ground. A new station, No. 2, then lifted the oil\r\n    to the next high point, the crest of the Alleghanies. As the\r\n    gradient line shows, the oil now would flow to Station 4, making\r\n    many steep ascents without further pumping. Station 3 was added to\r\n    increase the speed of the flow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy January, 1882, the Tidewater was in such a satisfactory condition\r\nthat it decided to negotiate a loan of $2,000,000 to carry out plans for\r\nenlargement. The First National Bank of New York, after a thorough\r\nexamination of the business, agreed to take the bonds at ninety cents on\r\nthe dollar, but trouble began as soon as the probable success of the\r\nbond issue was known. The officials of the First National Bank were\r\ncalled upon by stockholders of the Tidewater, men holding nearly a third\r\nof the company’s stock, and assured that the company was insolvent, and\r\nthat it would be unsafe for the bank to take the loan. The First\r\nNational declined to be influenced by the information, on the ground\r\nthat the disgruntled stockholders had sold themselves to the Standard\r\nOil Company, and were trying to discredit the Tidewater, so that the\r\nStandard might buy it in. It had been planned to place some of these\r\nbonds in Europe, and Franklin B. Gowen was sent over for that purpose.\r\nMr. Brown said on the witness stand, a few months later, that as soon as\r\nMr. Gowen started from this side it was cabled to Europe that he was\r\ngoing over to place bonds which were not sound; that the stockholders\r\nwere all of them wealthy men, and if the bonds had been good property\r\nthey would have taken them themselves. Mr. Brown declared this report\r\nwas spread so generally on the other side that it interfered seriously\r\nwith Mr. Gowen’s attempt to place the loan.\r\n\r\nThese manœuvres failing to ruin the Tidewater’s credit, a more serious\r\nattack was made in the fall of 1882, by the filing of a long bill of\r\ncomplaint against the management of the company, followed by an appeal\r\nthat a receiver be appointed and the business wound up. The appeal came\r\nfrom E. G. Patterson, a stockholder of the Tidewater, and a man who, up\r\nto this time, had been one of the most intelligent opponents of the\r\nStandard in the Oil Regions. Mr. Patterson was one of the few who had\r\nrealised, from the first development of Mr. Rockefeller’s pretensions,\r\nthat it was a question of transportation, and that, if the railroads\r\ncould be forced by courts and legislatures to do their duty, the\r\ncoal-oil business would not belong to Mr. Rockefeller. He had been one\r\nof the strongest factors in the great suits compromised in 1880, and his\r\ndisgust at the outcome had been so great that he had washed his hands of\r\nthe Producers’ Union. Later he had been engaged by the state of\r\nPennsylvania to collect evidence on which to support a claim against the\r\nStandard Oil Company for some $3,000,000 of back taxes. The Standard had\r\nmade Mr. Patterson’s services unnecessary by coming forward and giving\r\nthe attorney-general all the information as to its financial condition\r\nwhich he desired. Exasperated at the result of all his efforts, and\r\nfeeling that he had been deserted by the public he had tried to serve,\r\nMr. Patterson sent word to the Standard that he proposed still further\r\nto attack them (just how he never explained) unless they would give him,\r\nnot to attack, as much as there was in the contract from the state.[88]\r\nThey seem to have thought it worth while to buy peace, and agreed to\r\ngive Mr. Patterson some $20,000 in all, and secure him a position for a\r\nterm of years. The first payment was made at the end of April, 1882, and\r\n$5,000 of the money received Mr. Patterson paid to the Tidewater for\r\nstock he had taken at its organisation. No sooner was the stock in his\r\nhands than he began the preparation of the bill of complaint above\r\nreferred to, and in December the case was heard.\r\n\r\nThe Oil Regions watched it with keenest interest. That Mr. Patterson had\r\nmade some settlement with the Standard was generally known, and the\r\ncharge was freely circulated that they had bribed him to bring this suit\r\nin hopes of blasting the credit of the Tidewater and getting its stock\r\nfor a song. The testimony brought out in the trial did not bear out this\r\npopular notion. The case was rather more complicated. That the suit was\r\nbacked by the Standard, one would have to be very naïve to doubt, but\r\nthey were using other and stronger parties than Mr. Patterson, and that\r\nwas a faction of the company known as the “Taylor-Satterfield crowd.”\r\nThese men, controlling some $200,000 worth of Tidewater stock, had been\r\nprofessing themselves dissatisfied with the management of the business\r\nfor some months, though always refusing to sell their holdings at an\r\nadvanced price. It was generally believed in the Oil Regions that their\r\n“dissatisfaction” was fictitious, that they were in reality in league\r\nwith the Standard in an attempt to create a panic in Tidewater stock, a\r\nbelief which was strengthened when it was learned that a big oil\r\ncompany, which the gentlemen controlled, the Union, had been sold about\r\nthat time to the Standard Oil Trust for something like $500,000 in its\r\nstock. The first manœuvre of the Taylor-Satterfield faction had been the\r\nattempt to dissuade the First National Bank from taking the Tidewater\r\nloan referred to above. Failing in this, they seem to have imbued Mr.\r\nPatterson thoroughly with their pretended dissatisfaction and to have\r\npersuaded him to bring the suit. For some reason which is not clear they\r\nfailed properly to support him in the suit, and when it came off they\r\npractically deserted him. The Tidewater had no trouble in proving that\r\nthe complaints of insolvency and mismanagement were without foundation,\r\nand Judge Pierson Church, of Meadville, before whom the case was argued,\r\nrefused to appoint the receiver, intimating strongly that, in his\r\njudgment, the case was an attempt to levy a species of blackmail, in\r\nwhich it must not be expected that his court would co-operate. Judge\r\nChurch’s decision was given on January 15. Two days later a sensation\r\ncame in Tidewater affairs, which quite knocked the Patterson suit out of\r\nthe public mind; it was nothing less than a bold attempt by the Taylor\r\nparty, or, as it was now known, “the Standard party,” to seize the reins\r\nof government. It was a very cleverly planned coup.\r\n\r\nThe yearly meeting for the election of officers in the company was fixed\r\nfor a certain Wednesday in January. By verbal agreement it had been\r\npostponed, in 1882, to some time in February, the controller, D. B.\r\nStewart, a member of the Taylor faction, representing that he could not\r\nhave his statement ready earlier. No notices were sent out to this\r\neffect, although this should have been done. Taylor and his party,\r\ntaking advantage of this fact perfectly well known to them, appeared at\r\nthe Tidewater offices on January 17, and although one of the Benson\r\nfaction, as the majority was known from the name of the company’s\r\npresident, was present with sufficient proxies to vote nearly two-thirds\r\nof the stock, they overruled him and elected themselves to the control.\r\nThey also elected to the Board of Managers, Franklin B. Gowen, the\r\npresident of the Reading, and James R. Keene, the famous speculator,\r\nboth large holders of Tidewater bonds. They followed their election\r\nimmediately by sending out notices to the banks with which the company\r\ndid business not to honour checks drawn by the Benson party, and to the\r\npost-office to deliver mail to no one but themselves.\r\n\r\nThe announcement caused a terrible commotion in oil circles. Both Mr.\r\nKeene and Mr. Gowen refused to recognise the new board, Mr. Gowen\r\ntelegraphing in answer to the notification of his election:\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOHN SATTERFIELD,\r\n      Titusville.\r\n\r\n  At quarter of three o’clock to-day I received a despatch signed with\r\n  your name as manager and chairman, stating that a meeting of the\r\n  Board of Managers would be held at noon to-day. While the notice\r\n  itself is sufficient to render invalid any action you may have\r\n  attempted at such meeting as has been held, even if you had power to\r\n  act at all, I deny your right to call any meeting or act in any\r\n  manner as an officer of the company, and will hold you and all your\r\n  associates responsible at law for the occurrences of yesterday, and\r\n  for your subsequent action thereunder.\r\n\r\n                                            (Signed)      F. B. GOWEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Benson party took immediate action, applying for an injunction\r\nrestraining the new board from taking possession of the books and\r\noffices. This was granted and a date for a hearing appointed. Up to the\r\nhearing the old board did business behind barricaded doors! The case was\r\nheard in Meadville before Judge Pierson Church—the same who had heard\r\nthe Patterson case. As it was a case to be decided on purely technical\r\nmatters—the rules governing elections—no sensation was looked for, but\r\none came immediately. It was a long affidavit from James R. Keene, even\r\nmore notorious then than now—there were fewer of his kind—for deals and\r\ncorners and devious stock tricks, declaring that both the Patterson case\r\nand this attempt to obtain control were dictated by the “malicious\r\ningenuity” of the Standard for the purpose of destroying the Tidewater\r\nand getting hold of its property:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “From my first connection with the company,” said Mr. Keene, “it has\r\n  been hampered and embarrassed in its business by the unscrupulous\r\n  competition of the Standard Oil Company. When it first began to\r\n  transport and deliver oil at tidewater, the refineries which\r\n  purchased and refined oil were one after another bought up by the\r\n  Standard Oil Company or driven out of business by vexatious and\r\n  oppressive annoyances. The most private details of our business have\r\n  been communicated to the officers of the Standard Oil Company, and\r\n  they have, by every means in their power, interfered with our\r\n  affairs. By the arrangement which they were able to make with the\r\n  railroads leading from the Oil Regions, other than the Philadelphia\r\n  and Reading Railroad Company and the Central Railroad of New Jersey,\r\n  the Standard Oil Company have been able to obtain a control of the\r\n  business of transporting and refining oil, with the exception of\r\n  that part of the business which has been carried on by the Tidewater\r\n  Pipe Company and their refineries, to which it had made deliveries.\r\n  Repeated efforts have been made by parties in their interest to\r\n  secure the control of the Tidewater Pipe Company, and if they could\r\n  succeed, the monopoly thereby secured would add many million dollars\r\n  a year to their profit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Keene’s putting of the case was undoubtedly correct, but pious\r\nhorror of commercial brigandage, coming from “Jim” Keene, was useful\r\nonly to give joy to a cynical world, unencumbered by the possession of\r\nstock in either concern. The Keene sensation was followed by a second,\r\nan affidavit from John D. Archbold, of the Standard Oil Company, denying\r\nthat his company had any interest in the present suit, but adding that\r\nfor some time the officers of the Tidewater had been seeking an alliance\r\nwith the Standard:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Byron D. Benson and David McKelvy have at various times for the\r\n  past years met me at their own instance, and have proposed to\r\n  combine the business of the Tidewater Pipe Company with that of the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, desiring the Standard Oil Company to agree on\r\n  a division of the business of transporting and refining oil, and to\r\n  agree with the Tidewater Pipe Company in fixing the rate of\r\n  transporting oil and the price of refined oils. These proposals were\r\n  renewed to me by B. D. Benson during the summer of 1882, he coming\r\n  to my office at his own instance and urging, by various arguments,\r\n  such an arrangement. These proposals, in whatever shape made, have\r\n  always been declined. This deponent has also had many interviews\r\n  with James R. Keene, and always at his request, upon the same\r\n  subject, in which interviews said Keene has earnestly urged such a\r\n  combination and has used many arguments in favour of the advantage\r\n  which would result from such a combination. These proposals have\r\n  always been declined.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally they were declined—the Standard was not seeking an alliance,\r\nit was seeking ownership of the Tidewater; and it expected so to\r\ndiscredit the company that it could buy in its stock for a song. Mr.\r\nArchbold’s affidavit cooled popular sympathy for the hunted concern no\r\nlittle, however. A suggestion of any kind of a compromise with the\r\nStandard was looked upon as rank disloyalty by the Oil Regions, free\r\ncompetition in rates and in prices being, they contended, the only hope\r\nof the country. Mr. Archbold’s affidavit must have something in it,\r\neverybody thought, though it might be, as Mr. Benson immediately swore,\r\n“grossly inaccurate.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of the charges and countercharges in this purely\r\ntechnical case. The judge took little notice of them in his decision,\r\nbut, after an exhaustive discussion of the points involved in the\r\nelection, decided it was illegal and continued the injunction he had\r\ngranted against the new board. Judge Church’s decision aroused general\r\nexultation in the Oil Regions—as any failure of the Standard to get what\r\nit wanted was bound to do, and with good reason. The Tidewater’s growth\r\nin the face of the Standard’s constant interference with its business\r\nwas proof that independent pipe-lines and independent refineries could\r\nbe built up if men had sufficient brains and courage and patience. What\r\none set of men had done, another could do. Their hope of restoring\r\nfreedom of competition to the oil business was still further brightened\r\nin June by the news that the Legislature of Pennsylvania had passed a\r\nfree pipe-line bill—the measure that they had been urging for twelve\r\nyears without avail. With a sturdy example of independence, like the\r\nTidewater, before them, and the right of eminent domain for pipes, the\r\nfuture of competition in oil seemed to be up to the oil men themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the Oil Regions have always been prone to jump at conclusions. They\r\nwere forgetting Mr. Rockefeller’s record when they concluded that he was\r\nthrough with the Tidewater. Because he had failed in his old South\r\nImprovement Company trick, that is, failed to create a panic among\r\nTidewater stockholders, and so get their property at panic prices, was\r\nno reason at all to suppose he had abandoned the chase. There still\r\nremained a legitimate method of getting into the company, and, as a last\r\nresort, Mr. Rockefeller accepted it. He bought the minority stock of the\r\nconcern, held by the Taylor party. Up to this time Mr. Rockefeller had\r\nappeared in Tidewater affairs as a destroyer. He now appeared in a rôle\r\nin which he is quite as able—as a pacifier, and his extraordinary\r\npersuasiveness was never exercised to better effect. “We own $200,000\r\nworth of your stock,” he could tell the people he had been fighting. “If\r\nyou will consent to confine yourselves to a fixed percentage of our\r\njoint business, and will sustain pipage rates and the price of refined\r\noil, we will let you alone. Let us dwell together in peace.”\r\n\r\nThe Tidewater, tired of the fight, accepted. And so these men—to whom\r\nthe oil business owes one of its most remarkable developments, who, in\r\nface of the most powerful and unscrupulous opposition, had in four years\r\nbuilt up a business worth five and one-half millions of dollars—signed\r\ncontracts in October, 1883, fixing the relative amount of business they\r\nwere henceforth to do as 11½ per cent. of the aggregate, the Standard\r\nhaving 88½ per cent. The two simply became allies. The agreement between\r\nthem was the same in effect as all Mr. Rockefeller’s running\r\nagreements—it limited and kept up prices.[89] Any benefit the oil\r\nbusiness might have reaped from natural and decent competition between\r\nthe two was of course ended by the alliance. For all practical purposes\r\nthe two were one. In the phrase of the region, the Tidewater had “gone\r\nover to the Standard,” and there it has always remained. The contract\r\nwas made for fifteen years, but since its expiration it has been lived\r\nup to honourably by both parties without other than a verbal\r\nunderstanding. For, note this: Mr. Rockefeller always keeps his word.\r\nIndeed, in studying his career, one is frequently reminded of Tom\r\nSawyer’s great resolution—never to sully piracy by dishonesty!\r\n\r\nThe Tidewater has prospered within the boundary Mr. Rockefeller drew for\r\nit, as those who have accepted submissively his boundaries have never\r\nfailed to do. Mr. Rockefeller is right when he says, as he does so\r\noften, that all who come with him prosper. That the company would have\r\nsucceeded in becoming eventually a formidable rival of the Standard, and\r\nin controlling much more than eleven per cent. of the business, no one\r\ncan doubt who knew Mr. Benson, Major Hopkins, Mr. McKelvy, and their\r\ncolleagues. They were business men of the first order, as their\r\ntremendous work from 1878 to 1883 shows.\r\n\r\nOnce more the good of the oil business was secure, and Mr. Rockefeller\r\nat once proceeded to arrange his great house in the new order made\r\nnecessary by the introduction of the seaboard pipe-line. The entire\r\ntransportation department of the business had to be reorganised. When\r\nthe seaboard pipe-line became a factor in the oil business, in 1879, the\r\nStandard Oil Company owned practically the entire system of\r\noil-gathering pipe-lines—that is, the lines carrying oil from the wells\r\nto the storing or shipping points. These lines were organised under the\r\nname of the United Pipe Lines, and the organisation was magnificent in\r\nboth extent and in character of service rendered. Never, indeed, has the\r\nability of the men Mr. Rockefeller gathered into his machine shone to\r\nbetter advantage than in the building up and management of the pipe-line\r\nbusiness. At the end of 1883, when the alliance was made with the\r\nTidewater, the United Pipe Lines were taking from the wells of\r\nPennsylvania fully a million and a half barrels of oil a month. Their\r\npipes, of an aggregate length of 3,000 miles, connected with thousands\r\nof wells scattered all over the wide Oil Regions.\r\n\r\nWhenever the oil men opened a new field, no matter how remote from those\r\nalready developed, the United Pipe Lines immediately went there to care\r\nfor the oil. In more than one case, in these years of rapid and\r\nexcessive development of oil territory, the pipe-line company invested\r\ngreat sums in preparing to take care of oil fields whose yield never\r\npaid the cost of the pipe laid. Thus, in 1882, there was a tremendous\r\nexcitement over the opening of the Cherry Grove field. The Standard\r\nspent $2,000,000 getting ready to take care of a great outpouring of\r\noil—which came, but did not stay. In 1882 Cherry Grove produced\r\n2,345,400 barrels; in 1883, 755,512! It cost the company forty-six cents\r\na barrel to take care of the production of one short-lived group of\r\nwells in this field, on which they never realised more than twenty cents\r\npipage.\r\n\r\nThe Standard not only gathered this oil; it stored it, to wait its\r\nowner’s demand. At this date it controlled 40,000,000 barrels of iron\r\ntankage, in which it stored the enormous stocks, over 35,000,000\r\nbarrels, which had accumulated in the five previous years. When the oil\r\npassed to the pipe-line, the owner received his money for it at once, if\r\nhe wished, or the line “carried” it. When a producer had 1,000 barrels\r\nin the line, he received a pipe-line certificate for it. In December of\r\n1883 the United Pipe Lines had issued certificates for nearly all of the\r\n35,000,000 barrels of stocks above ground. The oil men thus had a bank\r\nfor their oil, a bank recognised generally as sound as any in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSuch were the returns from the pipe-line for its services that no\r\nbusiness ever justified more fully the extraordinary outlays of money\r\nand energy which it had taken to perfect it. For each barrel of oil the\r\nUnited Pipe Lines gathered, they received, when it was taken from the\r\nlines, twenty cents. The service cost them perhaps two cents after\r\ninstallation, though in these years, when they were obliged to carry\r\nsome 30,000,000 barrels, they had constantly $6,000,000 on their books\r\non which they did not at once realise. They could afford to let this sum\r\nstand because of the storage charge. For every 1,000 barrels carried in\r\ntheir tanks they received $6.25 each fifteen days—$152 a year. Now,\r\ntankage did not cost over $250 per 1,000 barrels, so that the storage\r\nmore than paid its cost in two years. There were often great losses by\r\nfire, but these were paid by the owners of the oil—a pro rata assessment\r\nbeing made. There was a deterioration in quantity and quality of oil\r\nfrom holding, but this again was paid by the owners in a shrinkage\r\ncharge of three per cent., deducted from the quantity of oil when run.\r\nThus on every side the pipe-line business was guarded. So long as it\r\ncould keep out competition and hold up its prices, there was no better\r\npaying business in the United States than piping oil.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Mr. Rockefeller began to add long-distance pipe-lines\r\nto his business as soon as the Tidewater demonstrated their feasibility,\r\nand before the time the Tidewater was brought into harmony he had a\r\ncomplete system to the seaboard and to his inland refinery points,\r\norganised under the name of the National Transit Company. The United\r\nPipe Lines and the National Transit Company were really one business,\r\nthe former consisting of local lines and the other of trunk lines, and\r\nto make the organisation more compact the former was transferred to the\r\nlatter on April 1, 1884. The paid-up capital of the concern at this date\r\nwas $31,000,000. Just as Mr. Rockefeller claimed, in 1878, that he was\r\n“prepared to enter into a contract to refine all the petroleum that\r\ncould be sold in the markets of the world,” so now he could announce\r\nthat he was prepared to gather, store and transport all the crude\r\npetroleum not only that the markets of the world demanded, but that the\r\nproducers took from the ground. As things now stood the only remaining\r\npoint where he could possibly be affected by competition was the\r\nrailroads. A new relation to the railroads was created by the new\r\ndevelopment. Mr. Rockefeller was not only independent of them, he was\r\ntheir competitor, for, like them, he was a common carrier obliged to\r\ntransport what was offered. His open rate to New York was forty-five\r\ncents, to Philadelphia forty, though the actual service probably did not\r\ncost over ten cents. By the alliance with the Tidewater any danger of\r\ncompetition from a pipe-line, which could of course afford to cut the\r\nprice, was shut off. The railroads might possibly, however, lower the\r\nprices a little and still make a profit. It was very necessary that the\r\nprice be kept up in order that too much encouragement should not be\r\ngiven to outside refiners. The only group which threatened to grow to\r\nlarge proportions, at this time, was in the Oil Regions, a group which\r\nwas the direct outgrowth of the compromise of 1880. As will be\r\nremembered, the agreement with the Pennsylvania Railroad made then\r\nstipulated that all rates should be open, and that if a rebate was given\r\nto one shipper another could have it on demand. After the compromise the\r\nPennsylvania had undertaken again to stimulate the growth of independent\r\nrefineries, and several plants had been built in Titusville and Oil\r\nCity. Having removed the New York group from competition by the alliance\r\nwith the Tidewater it was Mr. Rockefeller’s business to make it as hard\r\nas possible for the independents in the Oil Regions to do business, and\r\nto do this he must make a contract with the Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when Mr. Rockefeller entered New Jersey with his seaboard\r\npipe-line, he had been obliged to cross the Pennsylvania Railroad. He\r\ncould not do so without the consent of the company, there being no free\r\npipe-line in the country. He accordingly had been obliged to make a\r\ntraffic arrangement with them to get his pipe through. A new arrangement\r\nwas now necessary in order to prevent competition, and in August, 1884,\r\na contract was signed, for “considerations mutually interchanged,” by\r\nwhich the National Transit Company agreed to give to the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad twenty-six per cent. of “all petroleum brought to the Atlantic\r\nseaboard by all existing carriers, whether rail or pipe, now engaged in\r\ntransporting such property, or which may hereafter engage in such\r\ntransportation in conjunction with the Transit Company’s pipes.” At the\r\nsame time that the Transit Company agreed to give the railroad this\r\namount of oil, it also signed an agreement to carry this oil for the\r\nrailroad on a sliding scale. When the open rate of the pipe-line was\r\nforty cents to Philadelphia the railroad was to pay the company eight\r\ncents—with each five cents difference, up or down, in the open rate,\r\nthere was to be one cent difference to the railroad, the Transit never\r\nto receive less than six or more than ten cents.[90] Suppose, for\r\nexample, that the entire seaboard shipment of oil in the month ending\r\nDecember 20, 1884, had been 1,000,000 barrels. 260,000 barrels belonged\r\nto the Pennsylvania. If the Transit Company ran all the railroad’s\r\npercentage it would get eight cents a barrel for the service, $20,800,\r\nand it would pay the railroad $104,000 less $20,800, or $83,200. The\r\npipe-line probably never ran the whole amount. More or less refined\r\noil—naphtha, benzine, and other petroleum products—would necessarily go\r\nby rail. Large sums were paid monthly by the National Transit, however,\r\nto the railroad. Mr. Rockefeller seems to have been paying the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad this money not to compete with him as an oil\r\ncarrier. It would be difficult to find in our variegated commercial\r\nhistory a more beautiful example of the beneficence of combination—to\r\nthose in the deal!\r\n\r\nWith the removal of danger of any competition by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, the transportation department of the Standard Oil Trust seems\r\nto have been as nearly a perfect machine, both in efficiency and in its\r\nmonopolistic power, as ever has been devised. It was more perfect,\r\nindeed, than the refining end of the trust, for independent refiners did\r\nexist, and since 1880 they had been showing increasing vigour, whereas\r\nthere seemed now no opportunity for an independent pipe-line ever again\r\nto develop. Who, with the Tidewater’s story in mind, would be bold\r\nenough to attempt to reach the sea? For the time being, then, the\r\nStandard Oil Company had things all its own way. It collected with its\r\nally, the Tidewater, practically the entire output of a great raw\r\nproduct. It manufactured fully ninety per cent. of this product, and\r\naimed to manufacture 100 per cent. It was a common carrier, and so\r\nobliged to deliver oil to rival refineries if they called for it, but\r\nthese refineries paid forty or forty-five cents for a service which cost\r\nthe Standard Oil Trust not over one-fourth of the sum.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller had every reason to be satisfied with oil transportation\r\nin 1884, but there was a part of the oil business which was not so\r\ncompletely in his grasp. The markets of the country were still open.\r\nThere the few independent refiners who had escaped strangulation were\r\nfree to barter as they could. But the right to make all the oil in the\r\nworld, which Mr. Rockefeller claimed, carried with it the right to sell\r\nall the oil the world consumed. The independent was therefore a poacher\r\nin the market and must be driven out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER TEN\r\n                            CUTTING TO KILL\r\n\r\n  ROCKEFELLER NOW PLANS TO ORGANISE OIL MARKETING AS HE HAD ALREADY\r\n    ORGANISED OIL TRANSPORTING AND REFINING—WONDERFULLY EFFICIENT AND\r\n    ECONOMICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED—CURIOUS PRACTICES INTRODUCED—REPORTS OF\r\n    COMPETITORS’ BUSINESS SECURED FROM RAILWAY AGENTS—COMPETITORS’\r\n    CLERKS SOMETIMES SECURED AS ALLIES—IN MANY INSTANCES FULL RECORDS OF\r\n    ALL OIL SHIPPED ARE GIVEN STANDARD BY RAILWAY AND STEAMSHIP\r\n    COMPANIES—THIS INFORMATION IS USED BY STANDARD TO FIGHT\r\n    COMPETITORS—COMPETITORS DRIVEN OUT BY UNDERSELLING—EVIDENCE FROM ALL\r\n    OVER THE COUNTRY—PRETENDED INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANIES STARTED BY THE\r\n    STANDARD—STANDARD’S EXPLANATION OF THESE PRACTICES IS NOT\r\n    SATISFACTORY—PUBLIC DERIVES NO BENEFIT FROM TEMPORARY LOWERING OF\r\n    PRICES—PRICES MADE ABNORMALLY HIGH WHEN COMPETITION IS DESTROYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo know every detail of the oil trade, to be able to reach at any moment\r\nits remotest point, to control even its weakest factor—this was John D.\r\nRockefeller’s ideal of doing business. It seemed to be an intellectual\r\nnecessity for him to be able to direct the course of any particular\r\ngallon of oil from the moment it gushed from the earth until it went\r\ninto the lamp of a housewife. There must be nothing—_nothing_ in his\r\ngreat machine he did not know to be working right. It was to complete\r\nthis ideal, to satisfy this necessity, that he undertook, late in the\r\nseventies, to organise the oil markets of the world, as he had already\r\norganised oil refining and oil transporting. Mr. Rockefeller was driven\r\nto this new task of organisation not only by his own curious intellect;\r\nhe was driven to it by that thing so abhorrent to his mind—competition.\r\nIf, as he claimed, the oil business belonged to him, and if, as he had\r\nannounced, he was prepared to refine all the oil that men would consume,\r\nit followed as a corollary that the markets of the world belonged to\r\nhim. In spite of his bold pretensions and his perfect organisation, a\r\nfew obstinate oil refiners still lived and persisted in doing business.\r\nThey were a fly in his ointment—a stick in his wonderful wheel. He must\r\nget them out; otherwise the Great Purpose would be unrealised. And so,\r\nwhile engaged in organising the world’s markets, he incidentally carried\r\non a campaign against those who dared intrude there.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Rockefeller began to gather the oil markets into his hands he\r\nhad a task whose field was literally the world, for already, in 1871,\r\nthe year before he first appeared as an important factor in the oil\r\ntrade, refined oil was going into every civilised country of the globe.\r\nOf the five and a half million barrels of crude oil produced that year,\r\nthe world used five millions, over three and a half of which went to\r\nforeign lands. This was the market which had been built up in the first\r\nten years of business by the men who had developed the oil territory and\r\ninvented the processes of refining and transporting, and this was the\r\nmarket, still further developed, of course, that Mr. Rockefeller\r\ninherited when he succeeded in corralling the refining and transporting\r\nof oil. It was this market he proceeded to organise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IN 1880\r\n\r\n  FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY SARONY\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe process of organisation seems to have been natural and highly\r\nintelligent. The entire country was buying refined oil for illumination.\r\nMany refiners had their own agents out looking for markets; others sold\r\nto wholesale dealers, or jobbers, who placed trade with local dealers,\r\nusually grocers. Mr. Rockefeller’s business was to replace independent\r\nagents and jobbers by his own employees. The United States was mapped\r\nout and agents appointed over these great divisions. Thus, a certain\r\nportion of the Southwest—including Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and\r\nTexas—the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, of St. Louis, Missouri, had charge\r\nof; a portion of the South—including Kentucky, Tennessee and\r\nMississippi—Chess, Carley and Company, of Louisville, Kentucky, had\r\ncharge of. These companies in turn divided their territory into\r\nsections, and put the subdivisions in the charge of local agents. These\r\nlocal agents had stations where oil was received and stored, and from\r\nwhich they and their salesmen carried on their campaigns. This system,\r\ninaugurated in the seventies, has been developed until now the Standard\r\nOil Company of each state has its own marketing department, whose\r\nterritory is divided and watched over in the above fashion. The entire\r\noil-buying territory of the country is thus covered by local agents\r\nreporting to division headquarters. These report in turn to the head of\r\nthe state marketing department, and his reports go to the general\r\nmarketing headquarters in New York.\r\n\r\nTo those who know anything of the way in which Mr. Rockefeller does\r\nbusiness, it will go without saying that this marketing department was\r\nconducted from the start with the greatest efficiency and economy. Its\r\naim was to make every local station as nearly perfect in its service as\r\nit could be. The buyer must receive his oil promptly, in good condition,\r\nand of the grade he desired. If a customer complained, the case received\r\nprompt attention and the cause was found and corrected. He did not only\r\nreceive oil; he could have proper lamps and wicks and burners, and\r\ndirections about using them.\r\n\r\nThe local stations from which the dealer is served to-day are models of\r\ntheir kind, and one can easily believe they have always been so. Oil,\r\neven refined, is a difficult thing to handle without much disagreeable\r\nodour and stain, but the local stations of the Standard Oil Company,\r\nlike its refineries, are kept orderly and clean by a rigid system of\r\ninspection. Every two or three months an inspector goes through each\r\nstation and reports to headquarters on a multitude of details—whether\r\nbarrels are properly bunged, filled, stencilled, painted, glued; whether\r\ntank wagons, buckets, faucets, pipes, are leaking; whether the glue\r\ntrough is clean, the ground around the tanks dry, the locks in good\r\ncondition; the horses properly cared for; the weeds cut in the yard. The\r\ntime the agent gets around in the morning and the time he takes for\r\nlunch are reported. The prices he pays for feed for his horses, for\r\ncoal, for repairs, are noted. In fact, the condition of every local\r\nstation, at any given period, can be accurately known at marketing\r\nheadquarters, if desired. All of this tends, of course, to the greatest\r\neconomy and efficiency in the local agents.\r\n\r\nBut the Standard Oil agents were not sent into a territory back in the\r\nseventies simply to sell all the oil they could by efficient service and\r\naggressive pushing; they were sent there to sell all the oil that was\r\nbought. “The coal-oil business belongs to us,” was Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\nmotto, and from the beginning of his campaign in the markets his agents\r\naccepted and acted on that principle. If a dealer bought but a barrel of\r\noil a year, it must be from Mr. Rockefeller. This ambition made it\r\nnecessary that the agents have accurate knowledge of all outside\r\ntransactions in oil, however small, made in their field. How was this\r\npossible? The South Improvement scheme provided perfectly for this, for\r\nit bound the railroad to send daily to the principal office of the\r\ncompany reports of all oil shipped, the name of shipper, the quantity\r\nand kind of oil, the name of consignee, with the destination and the\r\ncost of freight.[91] Having such knowledge as this, an agent could\r\nimmediately locate each shipment of the independent refiner, and take\r\nthe proper steps to secure the trade. But the South Improvement scheme\r\nnever went into operation. It remained only as a beautiful ideal, to be\r\nworked out as time and opportunity permitted. The exact process by which\r\nthis was done it is impossible to trace. The work was delicate and\r\ninvolved operations of which it was wise for the operator to say\r\nnothing. It is only certain that little by little a secret bureau for\r\nsecuring information was built up until it is a fact that information\r\nconcerning the business of his competitors, almost as full as that which\r\nMr. Rockefeller hoped to get when he signed the South Improvement\r\nCompany contracts, is his to-day. Probably the best way to get an idea\r\nof how Mr. Rockefeller built up this department, as well as others of\r\nhis marketing bureau, is to examine it as it stands to-day. First, then,\r\nas to the methods of securing information which are in operation.\r\n\r\nNaturally and properly the local agents of the Standard Oil Company are\r\nwatchful of the condition of competition in their districts, and\r\nnaturally and properly they report what they learn. “We ask our salesmen\r\nand our agents to keep their eyes open and keep us informed of the\r\nsituation in their respective fields,” a Standard agent told the\r\nIndustrial Commission in 1898. “We ask our agents, as they visit the\r\ntrade, to make reports to us of whom the different parties are buying;\r\nprincipally to know whether our agents are attending to their business\r\nor not. If they are letting too much business get away from them, it\r\nlooks as if they were not attending to their business. They get it from\r\nwhat they see as they go around selling goods.” But there is no such\r\ngenerality about this part of the agent’s or salesman’s business as this\r\nstatement would lead one to believe. As a matter of fact it is a\r\nthoroughly scientific operation. The gentleman who made the above\r\nstatement, for instance, sends his local agents a blank like the\r\nfollowing to be made out each month:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EXHIBIT “B—R.”[92]\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe local agent gets the information to fill out such a report in\r\nvarious ways. He questions the dealers closely. He watches the railway\r\nfreight stations. He interviews everybody in any way connected with the\r\nhandling of oil in his territory. All of which may be proper enough.\r\nWhen, in the early eighties, Howard Page, of the Standard Oil Company,\r\nwas in charge of the Standard shipping department in Kentucky, his\r\nagents visited the depots once a day to see what oil arrived there from\r\nindependent shippers. A record of these shipments was made and reported\r\nmonthly to Mr. Page. He was able to tell the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, in 1887, almost exactly what his rivals had been shipping by\r\nrail and by river. Mr. Page claimed that his agents had no special\r\nprivileges; that anybody’s agents would have been allowed to examine the\r\nincoming cars, note the consignor, contents and consignee. It did not\r\nappear in the examination, however, that anybody but Mr. Page had sent\r\nagents to do such a thing. The Waters-Pierce Oil Company, of St. Louis,\r\nonce paid one of its Texas agents this unique compliment: “We are glad\r\nto know you are on such good terms with the railroad people that Mr.\r\nClem (an agent handling independent oil) gains nothing by marking his\r\nshipments by numbers instead of names.” In the same letter the writer\r\nsaid: “Would be glad to have you advise us when Clem’s first two tanks\r\nhave been emptied and returned, also the second two to which you refer\r\nas having been in the yard nine and sixteen days, that we may know how\r\nlong they have been held in Dallas. The movement of tank cars enters\r\ninto the cost of oil, so it is necessary to have this information that\r\nwe may know what we are competing with.”[93]\r\n\r\nThe superior receiving the filled blanks carefully follows them by\r\nletters of instructions and inquiries, himself keeping track of each\r\ndealer, however insignificant, in the local agent’s territory, and when\r\none out of line has been brought in, never failing to compliment his\r\nsubordinate. But however diligent the agent may be in keeping his eyes\r\nopen, however he may be stirred to activity by the prodding and\r\ncompliments of his superiors, it is of course out of the question that\r\nhe get anything like the full information the South Improvement scheme\r\ninsured. What he is able to do is supplemented by a system which\r\ncompares very favourably with that famous scheme and which undoubtedly\r\nwas suggested by it. For many years independent refiners have declared\r\nthat the details of their shipments were leaking regularly from their\r\nown employees or from clerks in freight offices. At every investigation\r\nmade these declarations have been repeated and occasional proof has been\r\noffered; for instance, a Cleveland refiner, John Teagle, testified in\r\n1888 to the Congressional Committee that one day in 1883 his bookkeeper\r\ncame to him and told him that he had been approached by a brother of the\r\nsecretary of the Standard Oil Company at Cleveland, who had asked him if\r\nhe did not wish to make some money. The bookkeeper asked how, and after\r\nsome talk he was informed that it would be by his giving information\r\nconcerning the business of his firm to the Standard. The bookkeeper\r\nseems to have been a wary fellow, for he dismissed his interlocutor\r\nwithout arousing suspicion and then took the case to Mr. Teagle, who\r\nasked him to make some kind of an arrangement in order to find out just\r\nwhat information the Standard wanted. The man did this. For twenty-five\r\ndollars down and a small sum per year he was to make a transcript of Mr.\r\nTeagle’s daily shipments with net price received for the same; he was to\r\ntell what the cost of manufacturing in the refinery was; the amount of\r\ngasoline and naphtha made and the net price received for them; what was\r\ndone with the tar; and what percentage of different grades of oil was\r\nmade; also how much oil was exported. This information was to be mailed\r\nregularly to Box 164 of the Cleveland post-office. Mr. Teagle, who at\r\nthat moment was hot on the tracks of the Standard in the courts, got an\r\naffidavit from the bookkeeper. This he took with the money which the\r\nclerk had received to the secretary of the Standard Oil Company and\r\ncharged him with bribery. At first the gentleman denied having any\r\nknowledge of the matter, but he finally confessed and even took back the\r\nmoney. Mr. Teagle then gave the whole story to the newspapers, where it\r\nof course made much noise.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen testified before the recent Industrial Commission to\r\nthe belief that their business was under the constant espionage of the\r\nStandard Oil Company. Theodore Westgate, an oil refiner of Titusville,\r\ntold the Commission that all of his shipments were watched. The\r\ninference from his testimony was that the Standard Oil Company received\r\nreports direct from the freight houses. Lewis Emery, Jr., of Bradford, a\r\nlifelong contestant of the Standard, declared that he knew his business\r\nwas followed now in the same way as it was in 1872 under the South\r\nImprovement Company contract. He gave one or two instances from his own\r\nbusiness experience to justify his statements, and he added that he\r\ncould give many others if necessary. Mr. Gall, of Montreal, Canada,\r\ndeclared that these same methods were in operation in Canada. “When our\r\ntank-cars come in,” Mr. Gall told the Commission, “the Standard Oil\r\nCompany have a habit of sending their men, opening a tank-car, and\r\ntaking a sample out to see what it contains.” Mr. Gall declared that he\r\nknew this a long time before he was able to get proof of it. He declared\r\nthat they knew the number of cars that he shipped and the place to which\r\nthey went, and that it was their habit to send salesmen after every\r\nshipment. Mrs. G. C. Butts, a daughter of George Rice, an independent\r\nrefiner of Marietta, Ohio, told the Ohio Senate Committee which\r\ninvestigated trusts in 1898 that a railroad agent of their town had\r\nnotified them that he had been approached by a Standard representative\r\nwho asked him for a full report of all independent shipments, to whom\r\nand where going. The agent refused, but, said Mrs. Butts: “We found out\r\nlater that someone was giving them this information and that it was\r\nbeing given right from our own works.... A party writing us from the\r\nWaters-Pierce office wrote that we had no idea of the network of\r\ndetectives, generally railroad agents, that his company kept, and that\r\neverything that we or our agents said or did was reported back to the\r\nmanagers through a regular network of detectives who were agents of the\r\nrailroads and oil company as well.”\r\n\r\nBut while the proofs the independents have offered of their charges show\r\nthat such leaks have occurred at intervals all over the country, they do\r\nnot show anything like a regular system of collecting information\r\nthrough this channel. From the evidence one would be justified in\r\nbelieving that the cases were rare, occurring only when a not over-nice\r\nStandard manager got into hot competition with a rival and prevailed\r\nupon a freight agent to give him information to help in his fight. In\r\n1903, however, the writer came into possession of a large mass of\r\ndocuments of unquestionable authenticity, bearing out all and more than\r\nthe independents charge. They show that the Standard Oil Company\r\nreceives regularly to-day, at least from the railroads and steamship\r\nlines represented in these papers, information of _all_ oil shipped. A\r\nstudy of these papers shows beyond question that somebody having access\r\nto the books of the freight offices records regularly each oil shipment\r\npassing the office—the names of consignor and consignee, the addresses\r\nof each, and the quantity and kind of oil are given in each case. This\r\nrecord is made out usually on a sheet of blank paper, though\r\noccasionally the recorder has been indiscreet enough to use the railroad\r\ncompany’s stationery. The reports are evidently intended not to be\r\nsigned, though there are cases in the documents where the name of the\r\nsender has been signed and erased; in one case a printed head bearing\r\nthe name of the freight agent had been used. The name had been cut out,\r\nbut so carelessly that it was easy to identify him. These reports had\r\nevidently been sent to the office of the Standard Oil Company, where\r\nthey had received a careful examination, and the information they\r\ncontained had been classified. Wherever the shipment entered was from\r\none of the distributing stations of the Standard Oil Company, a line was\r\ndrawn through it, or it was checked off in some way. In every other case\r\nin the mass of reports there was written, opposite the name of the\r\nconsignee, the name of a person _known_ to be a Standard agent or\r\nsalesman in the territory where the shipment had gone.\r\n\r\nNow what is this for? Copies of letters and telegrams accompanying the\r\nreports show that as soon as a particular report had reached Standard\r\nheadquarters and it was known that a carload, or even a barrel, of\r\nindependent oil was on its way to a dealer, the Standard agent whose\r\nname was written after the shipment on the record had been notified. “If\r\nyou can stop car going to X, authorise rebate to Z (name of dealer) of\r\nthree-quarters cent per gallon,” one of the telegrams reads. There is\r\nplenty of evidence to show how an agent receiving such information\r\n“stops” the oil. He _persuades_ the dealer to countermand the order.\r\nGeorge Rice, when before the House Committee on Manufactures in 1888,\r\npresented a number of telegrams as samples of his experience in having\r\norders countermanded in Texas. Four of these were sent on the same day\r\nfrom different dealers in the same town, San Angelo. Mr. Rice\r\ninvestigated the cause, and, by letters from the various firms, learned\r\nthat the Standard agent had been around “threatening the trade that if\r\nthey bought of me they would not sell them any more,” as he put it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Butts in her testimony in 1898 said that her firm had a customer in\r\nNew Orleans to whom they had been selling from 500 to 1,000 barrels a\r\nmonth, and that the Standard representative made a contract with him to\r\npay him $10,000 a year for five years to stop handling the independent\r\noil and take Standard oil! Mrs. Butts offered as evidence of a similar\r\ntransaction in Texas the following letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  “LOCKHART, TEXAS, November 30, 1894.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Keenan, who is with the Waters-Pierce people at Galveston, has\r\n  made us several visits and made us propositions of all kinds to get\r\n  us out of the business. Among others, he offered to pay us a monthly\r\n  salary if we would quit selling oil and let them have full control\r\n  of the trade, and insisted that we name a figure that we would take\r\n  and get out of the business, and also threatened that if we did not\r\n  accept his proposition they would cut prices below what oil cost us\r\n  and force us out of business. We asked him the question, should we\r\n  accept his proposition, would they continue to sell oil as cheap as\r\n  we were then selling it, and he stated most positively that they\r\n  would advance the price at once should they succeed in destroying\r\n  competition.\r\n\r\n                                            “J. S. LEWIS AND COMPANY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ohio Investigation of 1898 John Teagle, of Cleveland, being upon\r\nhis oath, said that his firm had had great difficulty in getting goods\r\naccepted because the Standard agents would persuade the dealers to\r\ncancel the orders. “They would have their local man, or some other man,\r\ncall upon the trade and use their influence and talk lower prices, or\r\nmake a lower retail price, or something to convince them that they’d\r\nbetter not take our oil, and, I suppose, to buy theirs.” Mr. Teagle\r\npresented the following letter, signed by a Standard representative,\r\nexplaining such a countermand:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  “DES MOINES, IOWA, January 14, 1891.\r\n\r\n  “JOHN FOWLER,\r\n      Hampton, Iowa.\r\n\r\n  “_Dear Sir_:—Our Marshalltown manager, Mr. Ruth, has explained the\r\n  circumstances regarding the purchase and subsequent countermand of a\r\n  car of oil from our competitors. He desires to have us express to\r\n  you our promise that we will stand all expense provided there should\r\n  be any trouble growing out of the countermand of this car. We\r\n  cheerfully promise to do this; we have the best legal advice which\r\n  can be obtained in Iowa, bearing on the points in this case. An\r\n  order can be countermanded either before or after the goods have\r\n  been shipped, and, in fact, can be countermanded even if the goods\r\n  have already arrived and are at the depot. A firm is absolutely\r\n  obliged to accept a countermand. The fact that the order has been\r\n  signed does not make any difference. We want you to absolutely\r\n  refuse, under any circumstances, to accept the car of oil. We are\r\n  standing back of you in this matter, and will protect you in every\r\n  way, and would kindly ask you to keep this letter strictly\r\n  confidential....\r\n\r\n                                     “Yours truly,       E. P. PRATT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Shull, of the Independent Oil Company of Mansfield, Ohio,\r\ntestified before the same committee to experiences similar to those of\r\nMr. Teagle.\r\n\r\n“If I put a man on the road to sell goods for me,” said Mr. Shull, “and\r\nhe takes orders to the amount of 200 to 300 barrels a week, before I am\r\nable to ship these goods possibly, the Standard Oil Company has gone\r\nthere and compelled those people to countermand those orders under a\r\nthreat that, if they don’t countermand them, they will put the price of\r\noil down to such a price that they cannot afford to handle the goods.”\r\n\r\nIn support of his assertion Mr. Shull offered letters from firms he has\r\nbeen dealing with. The following citations show the character of them:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      “TIFFIN, OHIO, February 1, 1898.\r\n\r\n  “INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANY,\r\n          Mansfield, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  “_Dear Sirs_:—The Standard Oil Company, after your man was here, had\r\n  the cheek to come in and ask how many barrels of oil we bought and\r\n  so forth, then asked us to countermand the order, saying it would be\r\n  for our best; we understand they have put their oil in our next door\r\n  and offer it at six cents per gallon, at retail. Shall we turn tail\r\n  or show them fight? If so, will you help us out any?...\r\n\r\n                            “Yours truly,\r\n                                                    “TALBOTT AND SON.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      “TIFFIN, OHIO, January 24, 1898.\r\n\r\n  “INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANY.\r\n\r\n  “_Dear Sirs_: ... I am sorry to say that a Standard Oil man from\r\n  your city followed that oil car and oil to my place, and told me\r\n  that he would not let me make a dollar on that oil, and was dogging\r\n  me around for two days to buy that oil, and made all kinds of\r\n  threats and talked to my people of the house while I was out, and\r\n  persuaded me to sell, and I was in a stew what I should do, but I\r\n  yielded and I have been very sorry for it since. I thought I would\r\n  hate to see the bottom knocked out of the prices, but that is why I\r\n  did it—the only reason. The oil was all right. I now see the\r\n  mistake, and that is of getting a carload—two carloads coming in\r\n  here inside of a week is more than the other company will stand....\r\n\r\n                               “Yours truly,\r\n                                                       “H. A. EIRICK.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn case the agent cannot persuade the dealer to countermand his order,\r\nmore strenuous measures are applied. The letters quoted above hint at\r\nwhat they will be. Many letters have been presented by witnesses under\r\noath in various investigations showing that Standard Oil agents in all\r\nparts of the country have found it necessary for the last twenty-five\r\nyears to act at times as these letters threaten. One of the most\r\naggressive of these campaigns waged at the beginning of this war of\r\nexterminating independent dealers was by the Standard marketing agent at\r\nLouisville, Kentucky—Chess, Carley and Company. This concern claimed a\r\nlarge section of the South as its territory. George Rice, of Marietta,\r\nOhio, had been in this field for eight or ten years, having many regular\r\ncustomers. It became Chess, Carley and Company’s business to secure\r\nthese customers and to prevent his getting others. Mr. Rice was\r\nhandicapped to begin with by railroad discrimination. He was never able\r\nto secure the rates of his big rival on any of the Southern roads. In\r\n1888 the Interstate Commerce Commission examined his complaints against\r\neight different Southern and Western roads, and found that no one of\r\nthem treated him with “relative justice.” Railroad discriminations were\r\nnot sufficient to drive him out of the Southwest, however, and a war of\r\nprices was begun. According to the letters Mr. Rice himself has\r\npresented he certainly in some cases began the cutting, as he could well\r\nafford to do. For instance, Chess, Carley and Company were selling\r\nwater-white oil in September, 1880, in Clarksville, Tennessee, at\r\ntwenty-one cents a gallon delivered in carloads—export oil was selling\r\nin barrels in New York at that date at 10⅝ cents a gallon. Rice’s agent\r\noffered at eighteen cents. The dealer to whom he made the offer,\r\nArmstrong by name, wished to accept, but as he had been buying of Chess,\r\nCarley and Company, went first to see them about the matter. He came\r\nback “scared almost out of his boots,” wrote the agent to Rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Carley told him he would break him up if he bought oil of anyone\r\n  else; that the Standard Company had authorised him to spend $10,000\r\n  to break up any concern that bought oil from anyone else; that he\r\n  (Carley) would put all his drummers in the field to hunt up\r\n  Armstrong’s customers and sell his customers groceries at five per\r\n  cent. below Armstrong’s prices, and turn all Armstrong’s trade over\r\n  to Moore, Bremaker and Company, and settle with Moore, Bremaker and\r\n  Company for their losses in helping to break Armstrong up, every\r\n  thirty days.\r\n\r\n  “That if Armstrong sent any other oil to Clarksville, Tennessee, he\r\n  (Carley) would put the price of oil so low in Clarksville as to make\r\n  the party lose heavily, and that they (the Standard) would break up\r\n  anyone that would sell him (Armstrong) oil, and that he (Carley) had\r\n  told Stege and Reiling the same thing. Did you ever? What do you\r\n  think of that?”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVery soon after this, Chess, Carley and Company took in hand a Nashville\r\nfirm, Wilkinson and Company, which was buying of Rice. “It is with great\r\nreluctance,” they wrote, “that we undertake serious competition with any\r\none, _and certainly this competition will not be confined to coal-oil or\r\nany one article, and will not be limited to any one year_. We always\r\nstand ready to make reasonable arrangements with any one who chooses to\r\nappear in our line of business, and it will be unlike anything we have\r\ndone heretofore if we permit any one to force us into an arrangement\r\nwhich is not reasonable. Any loss, however great, is better to us than a\r\nrecord of this kind.” And four days later they wrote: “If you continue\r\nto bring on the oil, it will simply force us to cut down our price, and\r\nno other course is left to us but the one we have intimated.” Wilkinson\r\nand Company seem to have stuck to Rice’s oil, for sixteen months later,\r\nwe find Chess, Carley and Company calling on the agent of a railroad,\r\nwhich already was giving the Standard discriminating rates, to help in\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\nThe screw was turned, Mr. Rice affirms, his rate being raised fifty per\r\ncent. in five days.\r\n\r\nRice carried on his fight for a market in the most aggressive way, and\r\neverywhere he met disastrous competition. In 1892 he published a large\r\npamphlet of documents illustrating Standard methods, in which he\r\nincluded citations from some seventy letters from dealers in Texas,\r\nreceived by him between 1881 and 1889, showing the kind of competition\r\nhis oil met there from the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, the Standard’s\r\nTexas agents. A dozen sentences, from as many different towns, will show\r\nthe character of them all:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I have had wonderful competition on this car. As soon as my car\r\n  arrived the Waters-Pierce Oil Company, who has an agent here,\r\n  slapped the price down to $1.80 per case 110.”\r\n\r\n  “... Oil was selling at this point for $2.50 per case, and as soon\r\n  as your car arrived it was put down to $1.50, which it is selling at\r\n  to-day.”\r\n\r\n  “The Waters-Pierce Oil Company reduced their prices on Brilliant oil\r\n  from $2.60 to $1.50 per case and is waging a fierce war.”\r\n\r\n  “Waters-Pierce Oil Company has our state by the throat and we would\r\n  like to be extricated.”\r\n\r\n  “I would like to handle your oil if I could be protected against the\r\n  Waters-Pierce Oil Company. I am afraid if I would buy a car of oil\r\n  from you this company would put the oil way below what I pay and\r\n  make me lose big money. I can handle your oil in large quantities if\r\n  you would protect me against them.”\r\n\r\n  “The Waters-Pierce Oil Company has cut the stuffing out of coal-oil\r\n  and have been ever since I got in my last car. They put the price to\r\n  the merchants at $1.80 per case.”\r\n\r\n  “We have your quotations on oil. While they are much lower than what\r\n  we pay, yet unless a carload could be engaged it would pay no firm\r\n  to try and handle, as Waters-Pierce Oil Company would cut below cost\r\n  on same.”\r\n\r\n  “The day your oil arrived here, their agent went to all my customers\r\n  and offered their Eupion oil at ten cents per gallon in barrels and\r\n  $1.50 per case, and lower grades in proportion, and told them if\r\n  they did not refuse to take the oil he would not sell them any more\r\n  at any price, and that he was going to run me out of the business,\r\n  and then they would be at his mercy.”\r\n\r\n  “Now we think Waters-Pierce Oil Company have been getting too high a\r\n  price for their oil. They are able and do furnish almost this entire\r\n  state with oil. They cut prices to such an extent when any other oil\r\n  is offered in this state that they force the parties handling the\r\n  oil to abandon the trade.”\r\n\r\n  “Trace and hurry up car of oil shipped by you. We learn it is\r\n  possible that your oil is side-tracked on the line, that\r\n  Waters-Pierce might get in their work.”\r\n\r\n  “If we were to buy a car or more, the Waters-Pierce Oil Company\r\n  would manage to sell a little cheaper than we could, and continue\r\n  doing so until they busted me up.”\r\n\r\n  “In regard to oil, we are about out now, and Waters-Pierce have put\r\n  their oil up again and quote us at the old price.”\r\n\r\n  “Jobbers say when they take hold of another oil they are at once\r\n  boycotted by Waters-Pierce Oil Company, who not only refuse to sell\r\n  them, but put oil below what they pay for it, and thus knock them\r\n  out of the oil trade, unless they sell at a loss.”\r\n\r\n  “If I find that I can handle your oil in Texas without being run out\r\n  and losing money by this infernal corporation, the Waters-Pierce Oil\r\n  Company, I want to arrange with you to handle it extensively. I\r\n  received verbal notice this morning from their agent that they would\r\n  make it hot for me when my oil got here.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Rice claims, in his preface to the collection of letters here quoted\r\nfrom, that he has hundreds of similar ones from different states in the\r\nUnion, and the writer asked to examine them. The package of documents\r\nsubmitted in reply to this request was made up literally of hundreds of\r\nletters. They came from twelve different states, and show everywhere the\r\nsame competitive method—cutting to kill. One thing very noticeable in\r\nthese letters is the indignation of the dealers at the Standard methods\r\nof securing trade. They resent threats. They complain that the Standard\r\nagents “nose” about their premises, that they ask impudent questions,\r\nand that they generally make the trade disgusting and humiliating. In\r\nMississippi, in the eighties, the indignation of the small dealers\r\nagainst Chess, Carley and Company was so strong that they formed\r\nassociations binding themselves not to deal with them.\r\n\r\nThese same tactics have been kept up in the Southwest ever since. A\r\nletter, dated April 28, 1891, from the vice-president of the\r\nWaters-Pierce Oil Company, A. M. Finlay, to his agent at Dallas, Texas,\r\nsays bluntly: “We want to make the prices at Dallas and in the\r\nneighbourhood on Brilliant and water-white oil, that will prevent Clem\r\n(an independent dealer) from doing any business.” And Mr. Finlay adds:\r\n“Hope you will make it a point to be present at the next meeting of the\r\ncity council, to-morrow night, and do everything possible to prevent\r\ngranting a permit to build within the city limits, unless building\r\nsimilar to ours is constructed, for it would not be fair to us to allow\r\nsomeone else to put up constructions for the storage of oil, when they\r\nhad compelled us to put up such an expensive building as we have.”[94]\r\n\r\nMr. Rice is not the only independent oil dealer who has produced similar\r\ntestimony. Mr. Teagle and Mr. Shull, in Ohio, have furnished\r\nconsiderable. “The reason we quit taking your oil is this,” wrote a\r\nKansas dealer to Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, in 1896: “The Standard\r\nOil Company notified us that if we continued handling your oil they\r\nwould cut the oil to ten cents retail, and that we could not afford to\r\ndo, and for that reason we are forced to take their oil or do business\r\nfor nothing or at a loss.” “The Standard agent has repeatedly told me\r\nthat if I continued buying oil and gasoline from your wagon,” wrote an\r\nOhio dealer to the same firm in 1897, “they would have it retailed here\r\nfor less than I could buy. I paid no attention to him, but yesterday\r\ntheir agent was here and asked me decidedly if I would continue buying\r\noil and gasoline from your wagon. I told him I would do so; then he went\r\nand made arrangements with the dealers that handle their oil and\r\ngasoline to retail it for seven cents.”\r\n\r\nMr. Shull summed up his testimony before the same committee to which Mr.\r\nTeagle gave the above, by declaring: “You take $10,000 and go into the\r\nbusiness and I will guarantee you won’t be in business ninety days.\r\nTheir motto is that anybody going into the oil business in opposition to\r\nthem they will make life a burden to him. That is about as near as you\r\ncan get to it.”\r\n\r\nConsiderable testimony of the same sort of practices was offered in the\r\nrecent “hearing before the Industrial Commission,” most of it general in\r\ncharacter. The most significant special case was offered by Mr.\r\nWestgate, the treasurer of the American Oil Works, an independent\r\nrefinery of Titusville, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe American Oil Works, it seems, were in 1894 shipping oil called\r\n“Sunlight” in barrels to South Bend, Washington. This was in the\r\nterritory of the Standard agents at Portland, Oregon, one of whom wrote\r\nto a South Bend dealer when he heard of the intrusion: “We will state\r\nfor your information that never a drop of oil has reached South Bend of\r\nbetter quality than what we have always shipped into that territory.\r\nThey can name it ‘Sunlight,’ ‘Moonlight,’ or ‘Starlight,’ it makes no\r\ndifference. You can rest assured if another carload of ‘Sunlight’\r\narrives at your place, it will be sold very cheap. We do not purpose to\r\nallow another carload to come into that territory unless it comes and is\r\nput on the market at one-half its actual cost. You can convey this idea\r\nto the young man who imported the carload of ‘Sunlight’ oil.”\r\n\r\nWhen John D. Archbold, of the Standard Oil Company, had his attention\r\ncalled to this letter by Professor Jenks, of the Industrial Commission,\r\nMr. Archbold characterised the letter as “a foolish statement by a\r\nfoolish and unwise man” and promised to investigate it. Later he\r\npresented the commission with an explanation from the superior of the\r\nagent, who declared that the writer of the letter did not have any\r\nauthority to say that oil would be sold on the basis mentioned. “The\r\nletter,” he continued, “was intended to be written in a jocular manner\r\nto deny a claim that he was selling oil inferior in quality to that sold\r\nby others.” It is hard for the mere outsider to catch the jocularity of\r\nthe letter, and it must have been much more difficult for the dealer who\r\nreceived it to appreciate it.\r\n\r\nIndependent oil dealers of the present day complain bitterly of a rather\r\nnovel way employed by the Standard for bringing into line dealers whose\r\nprejudices against buying from them are too strong to be overcome by the\r\nabove methods. This is through what are called “bogus” oil companies.\r\nThe obdurate dealer is approached by the agent of a new independent\r\nconcern, call it the A B C Oil Company, for illustration. The agent\r\nseeks trade on the ground that he represents an independent concern and\r\nthat he can sell at lower prices than the firm from which the dealer is\r\nbuying. Gradually he works his way into the independent’s trade. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the new company is merely a Standard jobbing house which\r\nmakes no oil, and which conceals its real identity under a misleading\r\nname. The mass of reports from railroad freight offices quoted from in\r\nthis article corroborate this claim of the independents. The A B C Oil\r\nCompany is mentioned again and again as shipping oil, and in the audited\r\nreports it is always checked off in the same fashion as the known\r\nStandard companies, and none of its shipments is referred to Standard\r\nagents. Independents all over the country tell of loss of markets\r\nthrough underselling by these “bogus” companies. The lower price which a\r\nsupposedly independent concern gives to a dealer who will not, under any\r\ncondition, buy of the Standard, need not demoralise the Standard trade\r\nin the vicinity if the concession is made with caution. After the trade\r\nis secure, that is, after the genuine independent is ousted, the\r\nmasquerading concern always finds itself obliged to advance prices. When\r\nthe true identity of such a company becomes known its usefulness\r\nnaturally is impaired, and it withdraws from the field and a new one\r\ntakes its place.\r\n\r\nThere is never a dealer in oil too small to have applied the above\r\nmethods of competition. In recent years they have frequently been\r\napplied even to oil peddlers. In a good many towns of the country oil is\r\nsold from door to door by men whose whole stock in trade is their\r\npeddling wagons. Many of these oil peddlers build up a good trade. As a\r\nrule they sell Standard oil. Let one take independent oil, however, and\r\nthe case is at once reported. His customers are located and at once\r\napproached by a Standard tank-wagon man, who frequently, it is said, not\r\nonly sells at a lower price than they have been paying, but even goes so\r\nfar as to clean and fill the lamps! In these raids on peddlers of\r\nindependent oil, refined oil has been sold in different cities at the\r\ndoors of consumers at less than crude oil was bringing at the wells, and\r\nseveral cents per gallon less than it was selling to wholesale dealers\r\nin refined. It is claimed by independents that at the present time the\r\n“bogus” companies generally manage this matter of driving out peddlers,\r\nthus saving the Standard the unpopularity of the act and the\r\ndissatisfaction of the rise in price which, of course, follows as soon\r\nas the trade is secured.\r\n\r\nThe general explanation of these competitive methods which the Standard\r\nofficials have offered, is that they originate with “over-zealous”\r\nemployees and are disapproved of promptly if brought to the attention of\r\nthe heads of the house. The cases seem rather too universal for such an\r\nexplanation to be entirely satisfactory. Certainly the system of\r\ncollecting information concerning competitive business is not practised\r\nby the exceptional “over-zealous” employee, but is a recognised\r\ndepartment of the Standard Oil Company’s business. In the mass of\r\ndocuments from which the reports of oil shipments referred to above were\r\ndrawn, are certain papers showing that the system is nearly enough\r\nuniversal to call for elaborate and expensive bookkeeping at the\r\nheadquarters of each Standard marketing division. For instance, on the\r\nnext page is a fragment illustrating the page of a book kept at such a\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nWhat does this show? Simply that every day the reports received from\r\nrailroad freight agents are entered in records kept for the purpose;\r\nthat there is on file at the Standard Oil headquarters a detailed list\r\nof the daily shipments which each independent refiner sends out, even to\r\nthe initials and number on the car in which the shipment goes. From this\r\nremarkable record the same set of documents shows that at least two sets\r\nof reports are made up. One is a report of the annual volume of business\r\nbeing done by each particular independent refiner or wholesale jobber,\r\nthe other of the business of each individual local dealer, so far as the\r\ndetectives of the Standard have been able to locate it. For instance,\r\namong the documents is the report on a well-known oil jobbing house in\r\none of the big cities of the country—reproduced on the next page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The figures, dates, consignees and destination on the above are\r\n    fictitious. The names of shippers were copied from the original in\r\n    possession of the writer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA comparison of this report with the firm’s own accounts shows that the\r\nStandard came within a small per cent. of an accurate estimate of the X\r\nY Z’s business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The above is similar to the form compiled by the Standard Oil Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother curious use made of these reports from the freight offices is\r\nforming a card catalogue of local dealers. (See form on page 55.) Oil is\r\nusually sold at retail by grocers. It is with them that the local agents\r\ndeal. Now the daily reports from the freight offices show the oil they\r\nreceive. The competition reports from local agents also give more or\r\nless information concerning their business. A card is made out for each\r\nof them, tabulating the date on which he received oil, the name and\r\nlocation of the dealer he got it from, the quality, and the price he\r\nsells at. In a space left for remarks on the card there is written in\r\nred ink any general information about the dealer the agent may have\r\npicked up. Often there is an explanation of why the man does not buy\r\nStandard oil—not infrequently this explanation reads: “Is opposed to\r\nmonopolies.” It is impossible to say from documentary evidence how long\r\nsuch a card catalogue has been kept by the Standard; that it has been a\r\npractice for at least twenty-five years the following quotation from a\r\nletter written in 1903 by a prominent Standard official in the Southwest\r\nto one of his agents shows: “Where competition exists,” says the\r\nofficial, “it has been our custom to keep a record of each merchant’s\r\ndaily purchase of bulk oil; and I know of one town at least in the\r\nSouthern Texas Division where that record has been kept, whether there\r\nwas competition or not, for the past fifteen years.”[95]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The names, figures, and locations on the above form are fictitious.\r\n    The remarks are copied from cards in possession of the writer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inference from this system of “keeping the eyes open” is that the\r\nStandard Oil Company knows practically where every barrel shipped by\r\nevery independent dealer goes; and where every barrel bought by every\r\ncorner-grocer from Maine to California comes from. The documents from\r\nwhich the writer draws the inference do not, to be sure, cover the\r\nentire country, but they do cover in detail many different states, and\r\nenough is known of the Standard’s competitive methods in states outside\r\nthis territory to justify one in believing that the system of gathering\r\ninformation is in use everywhere. That it is a perfect system is\r\nimprobable. Bribery is not as dangerous business in this country as it\r\ndeserves to be—of course nothing but a bribe would induce a clerk to\r\ngive up such information as these daily reports contain—but, happily,\r\nsuch is the force of tradition that even those who have practised it for\r\na long time shrink from discovery. It is one of those political and\r\nbusiness practices which are only respectable when concealed. Naturally,\r\nthen, the above system of gathering information must be handled with\r\ncare, and can never have the same perfection as that Mr. Rockefeller\r\nexpected when he signed the South Improvement Company charter.\r\n\r\nThe moral effect of this system on employees is even a more serious\r\nfeature of the case than the injustice it works to competition. For a\r\n“consideration” railroad freight clerks give confidential information\r\nconcerning freight going through their hands. It would certainly be\r\nquite as legitimate for post-office clerks to allow Mr. Rockefeller to\r\nread the private letters of his competitors, as it is that the clerks of\r\na railroad give him data concerning their shipments. Everybody through\r\nwhose hands such information passes is contaminated by the knowledge. To\r\nbe a factor, though even so small a one, in such a transaction, blunts\r\none’s sense of right and fairness. The effect on the local Standard\r\nagent cannot but be demoralising. Prodded constantly by letters and\r\ntelegrams from superiors to secure the countermand of independent oil,\r\nconfronted by statements of the amount of sales which have gotten away\r\nfrom him, information he knows only too well to have been secured by\r\nunderhand means, obliged to explain why he cannot get this or that trade\r\naway from a rival salesman, he sinks into habits of bullying and\r\nwheedling utterly inconsistent with self-respect. “Is there nothing you\r\nindependents can do to prevent our people finding out who you sell to?”\r\nan independent dealer reports a hunted Standard agent asking him. “My\r\nlife is made miserable by the pressure brought on to chase up your\r\nsales. I don’t like such business. It isn’t right, but what can I do?”\r\n\r\nThe system results every now and then, naturally enough, in flagrant\r\ncases of bribing employees of the independents themselves. Where the\r\nfreight office does not yield the information, the rival’s own office\r\nmay, and certainly if it is legitimate to get it from one place it is\r\nfrom the other. It is not an unusual thing for independent refiners to\r\ndischarge a man whom they have reason to believe gives confidential\r\ninformation to the Standard. An outrageous case of this, which occurred\r\nsome ten years ago, is contained in an affidavit which has been recently\r\nput at the writer’s disposition. It seems that in 1892 the Lewis Emery\r\nOil Company, an independent selling concern in Philadelphia, employed a\r\nman by the name of Buckley. This man was discharged, and in September of\r\nthat year he went into the employ of the leading Standard refinery of\r\nPhiladelphia, a concern known as the Atlantic Refining Company.\r\nAccording to the affidavit made by this man Buckley, the managers of the\r\nStandard concern, some time in February, 1893, engaged him in\r\nconversation about affairs of his late employer. They said that if they\r\ncould only find out the names of the persons to whom their rival sold,\r\nand for what prices, they could soon run him out of business! And they\r\nasked Buckley if he could not get the information for them. After some\r\ndiscussion, one of the Standard managers said: “What’s the matter with\r\nthe nigger?” alluding to a coloured boy in the employment of the Lewis\r\nEmery concern. Buckley told them that he would try him. “You can tell\r\nthe nigger,” said one of the men, “that he needn’t be afraid, because if\r\nhe loses his position there’s a position here for him.”\r\n\r\nBuckley saw the negro and made a proposition to him. The boy agreed to\r\nfurnish the information for a price. “Starting from February, 1893,”\r\nsays Mr. Buckley, “and lasting up to about August of the same year, this\r\nboy furnished me periodically with the daily shipments of the Lewis\r\nEmery concern, which I took and handed personally, sometimes to one and\r\nsometimes to the other manager. They took copies of them, and usually\r\nreturned the originals.” The negro also brought what is known as the\r\nprice-book to Buckley, and a complete copy of this was made by the\r\nStandard managers. “In short,” says Mr. Buckley in his affidavit, “I\r\nobtained from the negro all the inside facts concerning the Lewis Emery\r\nOil Company’s business, and I furnished them all to the Standard\r\nmanagers.” In return for this information the negro lad was paid various\r\nsums, amounting in all to about ninety dollars. Buckley says that they\r\nwere charged upon the Standard books to “Special Expenses.” The\r\ntransaction was ended by the discharge of the coloured boy by the Lewis\r\nEmery concern.\r\n\r\nThe dénouement of this case is tragic enough. The concern was finally\r\ndriven out of business by these and similar tactics, so Mr. Emery and\r\nhis partner both affirm. The negro was never taken into the Atlantic\r\nRefinery, and Buckley soon after lost his position, as he of course\r\nrichly deserved to. A man who shows himself traitorous, lying, thieving,\r\neven for the “good of the oil business,” is never kept long in the\r\nemployment of the Standard Oil Company. It is notorious in the Oil\r\nRegions that the people who “sell” to the Standard are never given\r\nresponsible positions. They may be shifted around to do “dirty work,” as\r\nthe Oil Regions phrase goes, but they are pariahs in the concern. Mr.\r\nRockefeller knows as well as any man ever did the vital necessity of\r\nhonesty in an organisation, and the Buckleys and negroes who bring him\r\nsecret intelligence never get anything but money and contempt for their\r\npains.\r\n\r\nFor the general public, absorbed chiefly in the question, “How does all\r\nthis affect what we are paying for oil?” the chief point of interest in\r\nthe marketing contests is that, after they were over, the price of oil\r\nhas always gone back with a jerk to the point where it was when the\r\ncutting began, and not infrequently it has gone higher—the public pays.\r\nSeveral of the letters already quoted in this chapter show the immediate\r\nrecoil of the market to higher prices with the removal of competition. A\r\ntable was prepared in 1892 to show the effect of competition on the\r\nprice of oil in various states of the Union. The results were startling.\r\nIn California, oil which sold at non-competitive points at 26½ cents a\r\ngallon, at competitive points brought 17½ cents. In Denver, Colorado,\r\nthere was an “Oil War” on in the spring of 1892, and the same oil which\r\nwas selling at Montrose and Garrison at twenty-five cents a gallon, in\r\nDenver sold at seven cents. This competition finally killed opposition\r\nand Denver thereafter paid twenty-five cents. The profits on this price\r\nwere certainly great enough to call for competition. The same oil which\r\nwas sold in Colorado in the spring of 1892 at twenty-five cents, sold in\r\nNew York for exportation at 6.10 cents. Of course the freight rates to\r\nColorado were high, the open rate was said to be nine cents a gallon,\r\nbut that it cost the Standard Oil Company nine cents a gallon to get its\r\noil there, one would have to have documentary proof to believe, and,\r\neven if it did, there was still some ten cents profit on a gallon—five\r\ndollars on a barrel. In Kansas, at this time, the difference between the\r\nprice at competitive and non-competitive points was seven cents; in\r\nIndiana six cents; in South Carolina four and one-half cents.[96]\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, of Cleveland, prepared a circular\r\nshowing the difference between prices at competitive and non-competitive\r\npoints in Ohio, and sent it out to the trade. According to this circular\r\nthe public paid from 25 to 33⅓ per cent. more where there was no\r\ncompetition. The fact that oil is cheaper where there is competition,\r\nand also that the public has to pay the cost of the expensive “Oil Wars”\r\nwhich have been carried on so constantly for the last twenty-five years\r\nall over the country, is coming to be recognised, especially in the\r\nMiddle West of this country, by both dealers and communities. There is\r\nno question that the attempts of Standard agents to persuade or bully\r\ndealers into countermanding orders, or giving up an independent with\r\nwhose oil they are satisfied, meet with much less general success than\r\nthey once did. It even happens now and then that communities who have\r\nhad experience with “Oil Wars” will stand by an independent dealer for\r\nmonths at a time, resisting even the temptation to have their lamps\r\ncleaned and filled at next to nothing.\r\n\r\nBriefly put, then, the conclusion, from a careful examination of the\r\ntestimony on Standard competitive methods, is this:\r\n\r\nThe marketing department of the Standard Oil Company is organised to\r\ncover the entire country, and aims to sell all the oil sold in each of\r\nits divisions. To forestall or meet competition it has organised an\r\nelaborate secret service for locating the quantity, quality, and selling\r\nprice of independent shipments. Having located an order for independent\r\noil with a dealer, it persuades him, if possible, to countermand the\r\norder. If this is impossible, it threatens “predatory competition,” that\r\nis, to sell at cost or less, until the rival is worn out. If the dealer\r\nstill is obstinate, it institutes an “Oil War.” In late years the\r\ncutting and the “Oil Wars” are often intrusted to so-called “bogus”\r\ncompanies, who retire when the real independent is put out of the way.\r\nIn later years the Standard has been more cautious about beginning\r\nunderselling than formerly, though if a rival offered oil at a less\r\nprice than it had been getting—and generally even small refineries can\r\ncontrive to sell below the non-competitive prices of the Standard—it\r\ndoes not hesitate to consider the lower price a declaration of war and\r\nto drop its prices and keep them down until the rival is out of the way.\r\nThe price then goes back to the former figure or higher. John D.\r\nArchbold’s testimony before the Industrial Commission in 1898\r\npractically confirms the above conclusion. Mr. Archbold said that the\r\nStandard was in the habit of fighting vigorously to hold and advance its\r\ntrade—even to the extent of holding prices down to cost until the rival\r\ngives way—though he declared it to be his opinion that the history of\r\nthe company’s transactions would show that the competitor forces the\r\nfight. Mr. Archbold told the commission that he personally believed it\r\nwas not advisable to sell below cost for the sake of freezing out a\r\nsmaller rival, save in “greatly aggravated cases,” though he admitted\r\nthe Standard sometimes did it. The trouble is that, accepting Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s foundation principle that the oil business belongs to him,\r\nany competition is “an aggravated case.” All that is reassuring in the\r\nsituation has come from the obstinate stand of individuals—the refiners\r\nwho insisted on doing an independent business, on the theory that “this\r\nis a free country”; the grocers who resented the prying and bullying of\r\nStandard agents, and asserted their right to buy of whom they would; the\r\nrare, very rare, community that grasped the fact that oil sold below\r\ncost temporarily, meant later paying for the fight. These features of\r\nthe business belong to the last decade and a half. At the period we have\r\nreached in this history—that is, the completion of the monopoly of the\r\npipe-lines in 1884 and the end of competition in transporting oil—there\r\nseemed to the independents no escape from Mr. Rockefeller in the market.\r\n\r\nThe sureness and promptness with which he located their shipments seemed\r\nuncanny to them. The ruthlessness and persistency with which he cut and\r\ncontinued to cut their prices drove them to despair. The character of\r\nthe competition Mr. Rockefeller carried on in the markets, particularly\r\nof the South and Middle West of this country, at this time, aggravated\r\ndaily the feeble refining element, and bred contempt far and wide among\r\npeople who saw the cutting, and perhaps profited temporarily by it, but\r\nwho had neither the power nor the courage to interfere. The knowledge of\r\nit fed greatly the bitterness in the Oil Regions. Part of the stock in\r\nconversation of every dissatisfied oil producer or ruined refiner became\r\ntales of disastrous conflicts in markets. They told of crippled men\r\nselling independent oil from a hand cart, whose trade had been wiped out\r\nby a Standard cart which followed him day by day, practically giving\r\naway oil. They told of grocers driven out of business by an attempt to\r\nstand by a refiner. They told endless tales, probably all exaggerated,\r\nperhaps some of them false, yet all of them believed, because of such\r\nfacts as have been rehearsed above. There came to be a popular\r\nconviction that the “Standard would do anything.” It was a condition\r\nwhich promised endless annoyance to Mr. Rockefeller and his colleagues.\r\nIt meant popular mistrust, petty hostilities, misinterpretations,\r\ncontempt, abuse. There were plenty of people even willing to deny Mr.\r\nRockefeller ability. That the Standard was in a venture was enough in\r\nthose people’s minds to damn it. Anything the Standard wanted was wrong,\r\nanything they contested was right. A verdict for them demonstrated the\r\ncorruption of the judge and jury; against them their righteousness. Mr.\r\nRockefeller, indeed, was each year having more reason to realise\r\nmonopoly building had its trials as wells as its profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n                         THE WAR ON THE REBATE\r\n\r\n  ROCKEFELLER’S SILENCE—BELIEF IN THE OIL REGIONS THAT COMBINED\r\n    OPPOSITION TO HIM WAS USELESS—INDIVIDUAL OPPOSITION STILL\r\n    CONSPICUOUS—THE STANDARD’S SUIT AGAINST SCOFIELD, SHURMER AND\r\n    TEAGLE—SEEKS TO ENFORCE AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT FIRM TO LIMIT OUTPUT\r\n    OF REFINED OIL—SCOFIELD, SHURMER AND TEAGLE ATTEMPT TO DO BUSINESS\r\n    INDEPENDENTLY OF THE STANDARD AND ITS REBATES—FIND THEIR LOT\r\n    HARD—THEY SUE THE LAKE SHORE AND MICHIGAN SOUTHERN RAILWAY FOR\r\n    DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THEM—A FAMOUS CASE AND ONE THE RAILWAY\r\n    LOSES—ANOTHER CASE IN THIS WAR OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE REBATE SHOWS\r\n    THE STANDARD STILL TO BE TAKING DRAWBACKS—THE CASE OF GEORGE RICE\r\n    AGAINST THE RECEIVER OF THE CINCINNATI AND MARIETTA RAILROAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apathy and inaction which naturally flow from a great defeat lay\r\nover the Oil Regions of Northwestern Pennsylvania long after the\r\ncompromise with John D. Rockefeller in 1880, followed, as it was, by the\r\ncombination with the Standard of the great independent seaboard\r\npipe-line which had grown up under the oil men’s encouragement and\r\npatronage. Years of war with a humiliating outcome had inspired the\r\nproducers with the conviction that fighting was useless, that they were\r\ndealing with a power verging on the superhuman—a power carrying\r\nconcealed weapons, fighting in the dark, and endowed with an altogether\r\ndiabolic cleverness. Strange as the statement may appear, there is no\r\ndisputing that by 1884 the Oil Regions as a whole looked on Mr.\r\nRockefeller with superstitious awe. Their notion of him was very like\r\nthat which the English common people had for Napoleon in the first part\r\nof the 19th century, which the peasants of Brittany have even to-day for\r\nthe English—a dread power, cruel, omniscient, always ready to spring.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind, altogether abnormal in daring, impetuous, and\r\nself-confident men, as those of the Oil Regions were, was based on\r\nsomething more than the series of bold and admirably executed attacks\r\nwhich had made Mr. Rockefeller master of the oil business. The first\r\nreason for it was the atmosphere of mystery in which Mr. Rockefeller had\r\nsucceeded in enveloping himself. He seems by nature to dislike the\r\npublic eye. In his early years his home, his office, and the Baptist\r\nchurch were practically the only places which saw him. He did not\r\nfrequent clubs, theatres, public meetings. When his manœuvres began to\r\nbring public criticism upon him, his dislike of the public eye seems to\r\nhave increased. He took a residence in New York, but he was unknown\r\nthere save to those who did business with him or were interested in his\r\nchurch and charities. His was perhaps the least familiar face in the\r\nStandard Oil Company. He never went to the Oil Regions, and the Oil\r\nRegions said he was afraid to come, which might or might not have been\r\ntrue. Certainly the Oil Regions never hesitated to express opinions\r\nabout him calculated to make a discreet man keep his distance.\r\n\r\nEven in Cleveland, his home for twenty-five years, Mr. Rockefeller was\r\nbelieved to conceal himself from his townsmen. It is certain that the\r\noperations of his great business were guarded with the most jealous\r\ncare. The New York Sun sent an “experienced observer” to Cleveland in\r\n1882 to write up the Standard concern. He speaks with amazement in his\r\nletters of the atmosphere of secrecy and mystery which he found\r\nenveloping everything connected with Mr. Rockefeller. You could not get\r\nan interview with him, the observer complained; even his home papers had\r\nceased to go to the Standard offices to inquire about the truth of\r\nrumours which reached them from the outside. The hundreds of employees\r\nof the trust in the town were as silent as their master in all that\r\nconcerned the business, and if one talked—well, he was not long an\r\nemployee of Mr. Rockefeller. There was between the Standard Oil Company\r\nand the town and press of Cleveland none of the _camaraderie_, the\r\nmutual good-will and pride and confidence which usually characterise the\r\nrelations between great businesses and their environment.\r\n\r\nIn Cleveland, as in the Oil Regions, Mr. Rockefeller’s careful effort to\r\ncover up his intentions and his tracks had been at first met with jeers\r\nand blunt rebuffs, but he had finally succeeded in silencing and awing\r\nthe people. It is worth noting that while all of the members of the\r\nStandard Oil Company followed Mr. Rockefeller’s policy of saying\r\nnothing, there was no such popular dread of any other one of them. In\r\nthe Oil Regions, for instance, there was a bitter hatred of the Standard\r\nOil Company as an organisation, but for the most part the people liked\r\nthe men who served it, and certainly had no awe of them, for these men\r\ncirculated freely among their fellow-townsmen; they were active in all\r\nthe pleasures and enterprises of the communities in which they lived;\r\nthey were generous, able, cordial, and whatever the people said of the\r\nconcern they served, they generally qualified it by expressing their\r\npersonal likings for the men themselves.\r\n\r\nA second reason for the popular dread of Mr. Rockefeller was that this\r\nman, whom nobody saw and who never talked, knew everything—even\r\nunexpected and trivial things—and those who saw the effect of this\r\nknowledge and did not see how he could obtain it, regarded him as little\r\nshort of an omniscient being. There was really nothing in the least\r\noccult about Mr. Rockefeller’s omniscience. He obtained part of his\r\nknowledge of other people’s affairs by a most extensive and thoroughly\r\norganised system of news-gathering, such as any bright business man of\r\nwide sweep might properly employ. But he combined with this perfectly\r\nlegitimate work the sordid methods of securing confidential information\r\ndescribed in the last chapter. Certainly there is nothing of the\r\ntranscendental in this kind of omniscience, and the feeling of\r\nsupernaturalism which Mr. Rockefeller had inspired by 1884 has entirely\r\nevaporated since, as evidence of his methods has been circulated. The\r\nsource was, however, long secret, and when again and again men who could\r\nhardly suppose their existence known to Mr. Rockefeller saw movements\r\nanticipated which they believed known only to themselves and their\r\nconfidential agents, they began to dread him and to invest him with\r\nmysterious qualities. If Mr. Rockefeller had been as great a\r\npsychologist as he is business manipulator he would have realised that\r\nhe was awakening a terrible popular dread, and he would have foreseen\r\nthat one day, with the inevitable coming to light of his methods, there\r\nwould spring up about his name a crop of scorn which would choke any\r\ncrop of dollars and donations which the wealth of the earth could\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this dread was deplorable, for it intensified the feeling,\r\nnow wide-spread in the Oil Regions, that it was useless to make further\r\neffort at a combined resistance. And yet these men, who were now lying\r\ntoo supine in Mr. Rockefeller’s steel glove even to squirm, had laid the\r\nfoundation of freedom in the oil business. It has taken thirty years to\r\ndemonstrate the inestimable value of the efforts which in 1884 they\r\nregarded as futile—thirty years to build even a small structure on the\r\nfoundation they had laid, though that much has been done.\r\n\r\nThe situation was saved at this critical time by individuals scattered\r\nthrough the oil world who were resolved to test the validity of Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s claim that the coal-oil business belonged to him. “We have\r\na right to do an independent business,” they said, “and we propose to do\r\nit.” They began this effort by an attack on the weak spot in Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s armour. The twelve years just passed had taught them that\r\nthe realisation of Mr. Rockefeller’s great purpose had been made\r\npossible by his remarkable manipulation of the railroads. It was the\r\nrebate which had made the Standard Oil Trust, the rebate, amplified,\r\nsystematised, glorified into a power never equalled before or since by\r\nany business of the country. The rebate had made the trust, and the\r\nrebate, in spite of ten years of combination, Petroleum Associations,\r\nProducers’ Unions, resolutions, suits in equity, suits in quo warranto,\r\nappeals to Congress, legislative investigations—the rebate still was Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s most effective weapon. If they could wrest it from his\r\nhand they could do business. They had learned something else in this\r\nperiod—that the whole force of public opinion and the spirit of the law\r\nwere against the rebate, and that the railroads, knowing this, feared\r\nexposure of discrimination, and could be made to settle rather than have\r\ntheir practices made public. Therefore, said these individuals, we\r\npropose to sue for rebates and collect charges until we make it so\r\nharassing and dangerous for the railroads that they will shut down on\r\nMr. Rockefeller.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and certainly the most influential of these private\r\ncases was that of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, of Cleveland, one of the\r\nfirms which, in 1876, entered into a “joint adventure” with Mr.\r\nRockefeller for limiting the output and so holding up prices.[97] The\r\nadventure had been most successful. The profits were enormous. Scofield,\r\nShurmer and Teagle had made thirty-four cents a barrel out of their\r\nrefinery the year before the “adventure.” With the same methods of\r\nmanufacture, and enjoying simply Mr. Rockefeller’s control of\r\ntransportation rates and the enhanced prices caused by limiting output,\r\nthey made $2.52 a barrel the first year after. This was the year of the\r\nStandard’s first great coup in refined oil. The dividends on 88,000\r\nbarrels this year were $222,047, against $41,000 the year before. In\r\nfour years Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle paid Mr. Rockefeller $315,345 on\r\nhis investment of $10,000—and rebates.\r\n\r\nAfter four years the Standard began to complain that their partners in\r\nthe adventure were refining too much oil—the first year the books showed\r\nthey had exceeded their 85,000–barrel limitation by nearly 3,000, the\r\nsecond year by 2,000, the third by 15,000, the fourth by 5,000.\r\nDissatisfied, the Standard demanded that the firm pay them the entire\r\nprofit upon the excess refined; for, claimed Mr. Rockefeller, our\r\nmonopoly is so perfect that we would have sold the excess if you had not\r\nbroken the contract, consequently the profits belong to us. Scofield,\r\nShurmer and Teagle paid half the profit on the excess, but refused more,\r\nand they persisted in exceeding their quota; then Mr. Rockefeller,\r\ncontrolling by this time the crude supply in Cleveland through ownership\r\nof the pipe-lines, shut down on their crude supply. If they would not\r\nobey the contract of their own will they could not do business. The firm\r\nseems not to have been frightened. “We are sorry that you refuse to\r\nfurnish us crude oil as agreed,” they wrote Mr. Rockefeller; “we do not\r\nregard the limitation of 85,000 barrels as binding upon us, and as we\r\nhave a large number of orders for refined oil we must fill them, and if\r\nyou refuse to furnish us crude oil on the same favourable terms as\r\nyourselves, we shall get it elsewhere as best we can and hold you\r\nresponsible for its difference in cost.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM C.

MATTHEWS\r\n\r\n  Independent refiner of Buffalo. Plaintiff in “Buffalo case,” where\r\n    members of the Standard Oil Company were indicted for conspiracy.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s reply was a prayer for an injunction against the\r\nmembers of the firm, restraining them individually and collectively\r\n“from distilling at their said works at Cleveland, Ohio, more than\r\n85,000 barrels of crude petroleum of forty-two gallons each in every\r\nyear, and also from distilling any more than 42,500 barrels of crude\r\npetroleum of forty-two gallons each, each and every six months, and also\r\nfrom distilling any more crude petroleum until the expiration of six\r\nmonths from and after July 20, 1880, and also from directly and\r\nindirectly engaging in or being concerned in any business connected with\r\npetroleum or any of its products except in connection with the plaintiff\r\nunder their said agreement, and that on the final hearing of this case\r\nthe said defendants may in like manner be restrained and enjoined from\r\ndoing any of said acts until the expiration of said agreement, and for\r\nsuch other and further relief in the premises as equity can give.” In\r\nthis petition, really remarkable for its unconsciousness of what seems\r\nobvious—that the agreement was preposterous and void because confessedly\r\nin restraint of trade—the terms of the joint adventure are renewed in a\r\nway to illustrate admirably the sort of tactics with refiners which, at\r\nthis time, was giving Mr. Rockefeller his extraordinary power over the\r\nprice of oil.[98]\r\n\r\nScofield, Shurmer and Teagle did not hesitate to take up the gauntlet,\r\nand a remarkable defence they made. In their answer they declared the\r\nso-called agreement had at all times been “utterly void and of no effect\r\nas being by its terms in restraint of trade and against public policy.”\r\nThey declared that the Standard Oil Company had never kept the terms of\r\nthe agreement, that it had intentionally withheld the benefits of the\r\nadvantages it enjoyed in freight contracts, and that it now was pumping\r\ncrude oil from the Oil Regions to Cleveland at a cost of about twelve\r\ncents a barrel and charging them (Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle) twenty\r\ncents. They denied that the Standard had sustained any damage through\r\nthem, but claimed that their business had been carried on at a large\r\nprofit. “There is such a large margin between the price of crude oil and\r\nrefined,” declared the defendants, “that the manufacture and sale of\r\nrefined oil is attended with large profit; it is impossible to supply\r\nthe demand of the public for oil if the business and refineries of both\r\nplaintiff and defendant are carried on and run to their full capacities,\r\nand if the business of the defendants were stopped, as prayed for by the\r\nplaintiff, it would result in a still higher price for refined oil and\r\nthe establishment of more perfect monopoly in the manufacture and sale\r\nof the same by plaintiff.” To establish such a monopoly, the defendants\r\nwent on to declare, had been the sole object of the Standard Oil Company\r\nin making this contract with them, and similar ones with other firms, to\r\nestablish a monopoly and so maintain unnaturally high prices,[99] and\r\ncertainly Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle knew whereof they swore, for they\r\nhad shared in the spoils of the winter of 1876 and 1877, and at this\r\nvery period, October, 1880, they were witnessing an attempt to repeat\r\nthe coup.\r\n\r\nThe charge of monopoly Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle sustained by a\r\nremarkable array of affidavits—the most damaging set for the Standard\r\nOil Company which had ever been brought together. It contained the\r\naffidavits of various individuals who had been in the refining business\r\nin Cleveland at the time of the South Improvement Company and who had\r\nsold out in the panic caused by it. It contained a review of the havoc\r\nwhich that scheme and the manipulation of the railroads by the Standard\r\nwhich followed it had caused in the refining trade in Pennsylvania, and\r\nit gave the affidavits of Mrs. B—— and of her secretary and others\r\nconcerning the circumstances of her sale in 1878 (see Chapter VI). The\r\naffidavits filed by John D. Rockefeller, Oliver H. Payne and Henry M.\r\nFlagler in reply to the set presented by Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle\r\nare curious reading. From the point of view of our present knowledge\r\nthey deny a number of things now known to be true.[100]\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary, however, for the defendants to have presented\r\ntheir elaborate array of evidence to support the charge of intended\r\nmonopoly. The character of the agreement itself was sufficient to\r\nprevent any judge from attempting to enforce it. The amazement was that\r\nthe Standard Oil Company ever had the hardihood to ask for its\r\nenforcement. “That it should venture to ask the assistance of a court of\r\nequity to enforce a contract to limit the production and raise the price\r\nof an article of so universal use as kerosene oil,” said the Chicago\r\nTribune, “shows that the Standard Oil Company believed itself to have\r\nreached a height of power and wealth that made it safe to defy public\r\nopinion.” This case is not the only one belonging to the period which\r\ngoes to support the opinion of the Tribune.\r\n\r\nScofield, Shurmer and Teagle were now obliged to stand on their own\r\nfeet. They could refine all the oil they wished, but they must make\r\ntheir own freight contracts, and they found rates when you worked with\r\nMr. Rockefeller were vastly different from rates when you competed with\r\nhim. The agent of the Lake Shore Railroad, by which most of their\r\nshipments went, told them frankly that they could not have the rates of\r\nthe Standard unless they gave the same volume of business. The\r\ndiscrimination against them was serious. For instance, in 1880, when the\r\nStandard paid sixty-five cents a barrel from Cleveland to Chicago,\r\nScofield, Shurmer and Teagle paid eighty. From April 1 to July 1, 1881,\r\nthe Standard paid fifty-five cents and their rival eighty cents; from\r\nJuly 1 to November 1, 1881, the rates were thirty-five and seventy cents\r\nrespectively, and so it went on for three years, when the firm,\r\ndespairing of any change, took the case into court. This case, fought\r\nthrough all the courts of Ohio, and in 1886 taken to the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, is one of the clearest and cleanest in existence\r\nfor studying all the factors in the rebate problem—the argument and\r\npressure by which the big shipper secures and keeps his advantage, the\r\ntheory and defence of the railroad in granting the discrimination, the\r\ntheory on which the suffering small shipper protests, and finally the\r\nlaw’s point of view. The first trial of the case was in the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, and the refiners won. The railroad then appealed to the\r\nDistrict Court (the present Circuit Court), where it was argued. So\r\n“important and difficult” did the judges of the District Court find the\r\nquestions involved to be, that on the plea of the railroad they sent\r\ntheir findings of the facts in the case to the Supreme Court of the\r\nstate for decision—a privilege they had under the law in force at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThese findings are elaborate, including some twenty-three\r\npropositions.[101] They have been confused by certain writers with the\r\n_opinion_ on them given later by the Supreme Court; for instance, in an\r\neconomic study recently published—“The Rise and Progress of the Standard\r\nOil Company,”—the twelfth and thirteenth and part of the fourteenth\r\nproposition which the District Court sent up to the Supreme Court in its\r\n“findings of facts” are quoted separately, and the inference from the\r\ncontext is that the writer supposed he was citing part of the court’s\r\n_opinion_. As the reader will see from what follows, the paragraphs in\r\nquestion are important, for, taken as quoted, they seem to show that the\r\nrebate the Standard received, and which Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle\r\nwanted, was on account of facilities it gave which the other refiners\r\ncould not give:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The court further find that prior to 1875 it was a question whether\r\n  the Standard Oil Company would remain in Cleveland or remove its\r\n  works to the oil-producing country, and such question depended\r\n  mainly upon rates of transportation from Cleveland to market; that\r\n  prior thereto said Standard Company did ship large quantities of its\r\n  products by water to Chicago and other lake points, and from thence\r\n  distributed the same by rail to inland markets; that it then\r\n  represented to defendant the probability of such removal; that water\r\n  transportation was very low during the season of navigation; that\r\n  unless some arrangement was made for rates at which it could ship\r\n  the year round as an inducement, it would ship by water and store\r\n  for winter distribution; that it owned its tank-cars and had tank\r\n  stations and switches, or would have, at Chicago, Toledo, Detroit\r\n  and Grand Rapids, on and into which the cars and oil in bulk could\r\n  be delivered and unloaded without expense and annoyance to\r\n  defendant; that it had switches at Cleveland leading to its works at\r\n  which to load cars, and would load and unload all cars; that the\r\n  quantity of oil to be shipped by the company was very large, and\r\n  amounted to ninety per cent. or more of all the oil manufactured or\r\n  shipped from Cleveland, and that if satisfactory rates could be\r\n  agreed upon it would ship over defendant’s road all its oil products\r\n  for territory and markets west and northwest of Cleveland, and agree\r\n  that the quantity for each year should be equal to the amount\r\n  shipped the preceding year; that upon the faith of these\r\n  representations the defendant did enter into the contract and\r\n  arrangement substantially as set forth in defendant’s answer; that\r\n  the rates were not fixed rates, but depended upon the general card\r\n  tariff rates as charged from time to time, but substantially to be\r\n  carried from time to time for about ten cents per barrel less than\r\n  tariff rates, and, in consideration of such reduced rates as to bulk\r\n  oil, the Standard Company agreed to furnish its own cars and tanks,\r\n  load them on switches at distributing points, and unload them into\r\n  distributing tanks, and was also to load and unload oil shipped in\r\n  barrels, and without expense to defendant, and with, by reason\r\n  thereof, less risk to defendant, which entered into the\r\n  consideration, and was also to ship all its freight to points west\r\n  and northwest of Cleveland, except small quantities to lake ports\r\n  not reached by rail, and to so manage the shipments, as to cars and\r\n  times, as would be most favourable to defendant; that defendant then\r\n  agreed to said terms; that said agreement so made in 1875 has\r\n  remained in force ever since.\r\n\r\n  “That, at a cost exceeding $100,000, said Standard Company had and\r\n  constructed the terminal facilities promised and herein found; that,\r\n  in fact, the risk of danger from fire to defendant, the expense of\r\n  handling, in loading and unloading, and in the use of the Standard\r\n  tank-cars is less (but how much the testimony does not show) than\r\n  upon oil shipped without the use of such or similar terminal\r\n  facilities; that said Standard Company commenced by shipping about\r\n  450,000 barrels a year over defendant’s road, which increased from\r\n  year to year until, in 1882, the year before filing the petition in\r\n  this action, the quantity so shipped on defendant’s road amounted to\r\n  742,000 barrels, equal to 2,000 barrels or one full train-load per\r\n  day.\r\n\r\n  “That said arrangement was not exclusive, but was at all times open\r\n  to others shipping a like quantity and furnishing like service and\r\n  facilities; that it was not made or continued with any intention on\r\n  the part of the defendant to injure the plaintiffs in any manner.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as a matter of fact, other propositions in this same set from which\r\nthe above are quoted, find that Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle offered the\r\nrailroad exactly the same facilities as the Standard, a switch, loading\r\nracks, exemption from loss by fire or accident.[102] “The manner of\r\nmaking shipments for plaintiffs and for the Standard Oil Company was\r\nprecisely the same, and the only thing to distinguish the business of\r\nthe one from the other was the aggregate yearly amounts of freight\r\nshipped,” said Judge Atherton, of the Supreme Court, who gave the\r\ndecision on the findings of fact, and he held in common with his\r\npredecessors that a rebate on account of volume of business only was “a\r\ndiscrimination in favour of capital,” and contrary to a sound public\r\npolicy, violation of that equality of rights guaranteed to every\r\ncitizen, and a wrong to the disfavoured person. “We hold, ...” he said,\r\n“that a discrimination in the rate of freights resting extensively on\r\nsuch a basis ought not to be sustained. The principle is opposed to\r\nsound public policy. It would build up and foster monopolies, add\r\nlargely to the accumulated power of capital and money, and drive out all\r\nenterprise not backed by overshadowing wealth. With the doctrine, as\r\ncontended for by the defendants, recognised and enforced by the courts,\r\nwhat will prevent the great grain interest of the Northwest, or the coal\r\nand iron interests of Pennsylvania, or any of the great commercial\r\ninterests of the country bound together by the power and influence of\r\naggregated wealth and in league with the railroads of the land, driving\r\nto the wall all private enterprises struggling for existence, and with\r\nan iron hand thrusting back all but themselves?” Judge Atherton was\r\nscathing enough in his opinion of the contract between the Lake Shore\r\nand the Standard. Look at it, he said, and see just what is shown. In\r\nconsideration of the company giving to the railroad its entire freight\r\nbusiness in oil, they transport this freight about ten cents a barrel\r\ncheaper than for any other customer. “The understanding was to keep the\r\nprice _down_ for the favoured customer, but _up_ for all others, and the\r\ninevitable tendency and effect of this contract was to enable the\r\nStandard Oil Company to establish and maintain an overshadowing\r\nmonopoly, to ruin all other operators and drive them out of business in\r\nall the region supplied by the defendant’s road, its branches and\r\nconnecting lines.”\r\n\r\nJudge Atherton was particularly hard on the portion of the contract[103]\r\nwhich pledged the Standard to give the Lake Shore _all_ its freight in\r\nreturn for the rebates, and for this reason: In 1883 a new road Westward\r\nwas opened from Cleveland, the New York, Cincinnati and St. Louis. It\r\nmight become an active competitor in transporting petroleum for\r\ncustomers other than the Standard Oil Company. It might establish such a\r\ntariff of rates that other operators in oil might successfully compete\r\nwith the Standard Oil Company. To prevent this, the Lake Shore road, on\r\nthe completion of the new road, entered into a tariff arrangement giving\r\nto it a portion of the Westward shipments of the Standard Oil Company,\r\non condition of its uniting in carrying out the understanding in regard\r\nto rebates to the Standard Oil Company. “How peculiar!” exclaimed Judge\r\nAtherton. “The defendant, by a contract made in 1875, was entitled to\r\nall the freights of the Standard Oil Company, and yet, say the District\r\nCourt, ‘for the purpose of securing the _greater part_ of said trade,’\r\nthey entered into a contract to divide with the new railroad, if the\r\nlatter would only help to keep the rates _down_ for the Standard and\r\n_up_ for everybody else.” Such a contract so carried out was, in the\r\nopinion of the court, “not only contrary to a sound public policy, but\r\nto the lax demands of the commercial honesty and ordinary methods of\r\nbusiness.”\r\n\r\nAnother fact found by the District Court incensed Judge Atherton. This\r\nwas that the contract “was not made or continued with any intention on\r\nthe part of the defendant to injure the plaintiffs in any manner.” It\r\ndoes not “make any difference in the case,” he declared. “The plaintiffs\r\nwere not doing business in 1875, when the contract was entered into,\r\nand, of course, it was not made to injure them in particular. If a man\r\nrides a dangerous horse into a crowd of people, or discharges loaded\r\nfirearms among them, he might, with the same propriety, select the man\r\nhe injures and say he had no intention of wounding him. And yet the law\r\nholds him to have intended the probable consequences of his unlawful act\r\nas fully as if purposely directed against the innocent victim, and\r\npunishes him accordingly. And this contract, made to build up a monopoly\r\nfor the Standard Oil Company and to drive its competitors from the\r\nfield, is just as unlawful as if its provisions had been aimed directly\r\nagainst the interests of the plaintiffs.”[104]\r\n\r\nHaving lost their case in the Supreme Court of the state, the Lake Shore\r\nnow appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the record\r\nwas filed in November, 1886. It was never heard; the railroad evidently\r\nconcluded it was useless, and finally withdrew its petition, thereby\r\naccepting the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio restraining it from\r\nfurther discrimination against Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BURST IN A PIPE LINE\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis case, which was before the public constantly during the six or\r\nseven years following the breaking up of the Producers’ Union, in which\r\nthe Oil Regions presented no united front to Mr. Rockefeller, served to\r\nkeep public attention on the ruinous effect of the rebate and to\r\nstrengthen the feeling that drastic legislation must be taken if Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s exploit was to be prevented in other industries.\r\n\r\nOne other case came out in this war of individuals on the rebate system\r\nwhich heightened the popular indignation against the Standard. It was a\r\ncase showing that the Standard Oil Company had not yet abandoned that\r\nunique feature of its railroad contracts by which a portion of the money\r\nwhich other people paid for their freight was handed over to them! This\r\npeculiar development of the rebate system seems to have belonged\r\nexclusively to Mr. Rockefeller. Indeed, a careful search of all the\r\ntremendous mass of materials which the various investigations of\r\nrailroads produced shows no other case—so far as the writer knows—of\r\nthis practice. It was the clause of the South Improvement contracts\r\nwhich provoked the greatest outcry. It was the feature of Mr. Cassatt’s\r\nrevelations in 1877 which dumfounded the public and which no one would\r\nbelieve until they saw the actual agreements Mr. Cassatt presented. The\r\nOil Regions as a whole did not hesitate to say that they believed this\r\npractice was still in operation, but, naturally, proof was most\r\ndifficult to secure. The demonstration came in 1885, through one of the\r\nmost aggressive and violent independents which the war in oil has\r\nproduced, George Rice, of Marietta, Ohio. Mr. Rice, an oil producer, had\r\nbuilt a refinery at Marietta in 1873. He sold his oil in the state, the\r\nWest, and South. Six years later his business was practically stopped by\r\na sudden raise in rates on the Ohio roads—an advance of fully 100 per\r\ncent. being made on freights from Marietta, where there were several\r\nindependent refineries, although no similar advance was made from\r\nWheeling and Cleveland, where the Standard refineries were located.\r\nThese discriminations were fully shown in an investigation by the Ohio\r\nState Legislature in 1879. From that time on Mr. Rice was in constant\r\ndifficulty about rates. He seems to have taken rebates when he could get\r\nthem, but he could never get anything like what his big competitors got.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 Mr. Rice began to draw the crude supply for his refinery from\r\nhis own production in the Macksburg field of Southeastern Ohio, not far\r\nfrom Marietta. The Standard had not at that time taken its pipe-lines\r\ninto the Macksburg field; the oil was gathered by a line owned by A. J.\r\nBrundred, and carried to the Cincinnati and Marietta Railroad. Now, Mr.\r\nBrundred had made a contract with this railroad by which his oil was to\r\nbe carried for fifteen cents a barrel, and all other shippers were to\r\npay thirty cents. Rice, who conveyed his oil to the railroad by his own\r\npipe-line, got a rate of twenty-five cents by using his own tank-car.\r\nLater he succeeded in getting a rate of 17½ cents a barrel. Thus the\r\nrebate system was established on this road from the opening of the\r\nMacksburg field. In 1883 the Standard Oil Company took their line into\r\nthe field, and soon after Brundred retired from the pipe-line business\r\nthere. When he went out he tried to sell the Standard people his\r\ncontract with the railroad, but they refused it. They describe this\r\ncontract as the worst they ever saw, but they seem to have gone Mr.\r\nBrundred one better, for they immediately contracted with the road for a\r\nrate of ten cents on their own oil, instead of the fifteen cents he was\r\ngetting, and a rate of thirty-five on independent oil. And in addition\r\nthey asked that the extra twenty-five cents the independents paid _be\r\nturned over to them_! If this was not done the Standard would be under\r\nthe painful necessity of taking away its shipments and building\r\npipe-lines to Marietta. The Cincinnati and Marietta Railroad at that\r\ntime was in the hands of a receiver, one Phineas Pease—described as a\r\n“fussy old gentleman, proud of his position and fond of riding up and\r\ndown the road in his private car.” It is probably a good description.\r\nCertainly it is evident from what follows that the receiver was much\r\n“fussed up” ethically. Anxious to keep up the income of his road, Mr.\r\nPease finally consented to the arrangement the Standard demanded. But he\r\nwas worried lest his immoral arrangement be dragged into court, and\r\nwrote to his counsel, Edward S. Rapallo, of New York City, asking if\r\nthere was any way of evading conviction in case of discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Upon my taking possession of this road,” the receiver wrote, “the\r\n  question came up as to whether I would agree to carry the Standard\r\n  Company’s oil to Marietta for ten cents per barrel, in lieu of their\r\n  laying a pipe-line and piping their oil. I, of course, assented to\r\n  this, as the matter had been fully talked over with the Western and\r\n  Lake Erie Railroad Company before my taking possession of the road,\r\n  and I wanted all the revenue that could be had in this trade.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. O’Day, manager of the Standard Oil Company, met the general\r\n  freight agent of the Western and Lake Erie Railroad and our Mr.\r\n  Terry, at Toledo, about February 12, and made an agreement (verbal)\r\n  to carry their oil at ten cents per barrel. But Mr. O’Day compelled\r\n  Mr. Terry to make a thirty-five cent rate on all other oil going to\r\n  Marietta, and that we should make the rebate of twenty-five cents\r\n  per barrel on all oil shipped by other parties, and that the rebate\r\n  should be paid over to them (the Standard Oil Company), thus giving\r\n  us ten cents per barrel for all oil shipped to Marietta, and the\r\n  rebate of twenty-five cents per barrel going to the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, making that company say twenty-five dollars per day clear\r\n  money on George Rice’s oil alone.\r\n\r\n  “In order to save the oil trade along our line, and especially to\r\n  save the Standard Oil trade, which would amount to seven times as\r\n  much as Mr. Rice’s, Mr. Terry verbally agreed to the arrangement,\r\n  which, upon his report to me, I reluctantly acquiesced in, feeling\r\n  that I could not afford to lose the shipment of 700 barrels of oil\r\n  per day from the Standard Oil Company. But when Mr. Terry issued\r\n  instructions that on and after February 23 the rate of oil would be\r\n  thirty-five cents per barrel to Marietta, George Rice, who has a\r\n  refinery in Marietta, very naturally called on me yesterday and\r\n  notified me that he would not submit to the advance, because the\r\n  business would not justify it, and that the move was made by the\r\n  Standard Oil Company to crush him out. (Too true.) Mr. Rice said: ‘I\r\n  am willing to continue the 17½ cent rate which I have been paying\r\n  from December to this date.’\r\n\r\n  “Now, the question naturally presents itself to my mind, if George\r\n  Rice should see fit to prosecute the case on the ground of unjust\r\n  discrimination, would the receiver be held, as the manager of this\r\n  property, for violation of the law? While I am determined to use all\r\n  honourable means to secure traffic for the company, I am not willing\r\n  to do an illegal act (if this can be called illegal), and lay this\r\n  company liable for damages. Mr. Terry is able to explain all minor\r\n  questions relative to this matter.”[105]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Rapallo, after consulting his partner and “representative\r\nbondholders,” “fixed it” for the receiver in the following amazing\r\ndecision:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “You may, with propriety, allow the Standard Oil Company to charge\r\n  twenty-five cents per barrel for all oil transported through their\r\n  pipes to your road; and I understand from Mr. Terry that it is\r\n  practicable to so arrange the details that the company can, in\r\n  effect, collect this direct without its passing through your hands.\r\n  You may agree to carry all such oil of the Standard Oil Company, or\r\n  of others, delivered to your road through their pipes, at ten cents\r\n  per barrel. You may also charge all other shippers thirty-five cents\r\n  per barrel freight, _even though they deliver oil to your road\r\n  through their own pipes_; and this, I gather from your letter and\r\n  from Mr. Terry, would include Mr. Rice.”[106]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, how was this to be done “with propriety”? Simply enough. The\r\nStandard Oil Company was to be charged ten cents per barrel, less an\r\namount equivalent to twenty-five cents per barrel upon all oil shipped\r\nby Rice. “Provided your accounts, bills, vouchers, etc., are consistent\r\nwith the real arrangement actually made, you will incur no personal\r\nresponsibility by carrying out such an arrangement as I suggest.” Even\r\nin case the receiver was discovered nothing would happen to _him_, so\r\ndecided the counsel. “It is possible that, by a proper application to\r\nthe court, some person may prevent you, in future, from permitting any\r\ndiscrimination. Even if Mr. Rice should compel you, subsequently, to\r\nrefund to him the excess charge over the Standard Oil Company, the\r\nresult would not be a loss to your road, taking into consideration the\r\nreceipts from the Standard Oil Company.”\r\n\r\nFortified by his counsel, Receiver Pease put the arrangement into force,\r\nand beginning with March 20, 1885, a joint agent of the Standard\r\npipe-line and of the Cincinnati and Marietta road collected thirty-five\r\ncents per barrel on the oil of all independent shippers from Macksburg\r\nto Marietta. Ten cents of this sum he turned over to the receiver and\r\ntwenty-five cents to the pipe-line. When Mr. Rice found that the rate\r\nwas certainly to be enforced he began to build a pipe of his own to the\r\nMuskingum River, whence he was to ship by barge to Marietta. By April 26\r\nhe was able to discontinue his shipments over the Cincinnati and\r\nMarietta road. This was not done until a rebate of twenty-five cents a\r\nbarrel had been paid to the Standard Oil Company on 1,360 barrels of his\r\noil—$340 in all.\r\n\r\nMr. Rice, outraged as he was by the discrimination, was looking for\r\nevidence to bring suit against the receiver, but it was not until\r\nOctober that he was ready to take the matter into court. On the 13th of\r\nthat month he applied to Judge Baxter of the United States Circuit Court\r\nfor an order that Phineas Pease, receiver of the Cleveland and Marietta\r\nRailroad, report to the court touching his freight rates and other\r\nmatters complained of in the application. The order was granted on the\r\nsame day the application was made. It was specific. Mr. Pease was to\r\nreport his rates, drawbacks, methods of accounting for discrimination,\r\nterms of contracts, and all other details connected with his shipment of\r\noil. No sooner was this order of the court to Receiver Pease known than\r\nthe general freight agent, Mr. Terry, hurried to Cleveland, Ohio, to\r\nmeet Mr. O’Day of the Standard Oil Company, with whom he had made the\r\ncontract. The upshot of that interview was that on October 29, twelve\r\ndays _after_ the judge had ordered the contracts produced, a check for\r\n$340, signed by J. R. Campbell, Treasurer (a Standard pipe-line\r\nofficial), was received from Oil City, headquarters of the Standard\r\npipe-line, by the agent who had been collecting and dividing the freight\r\nmoney. This check for $340 was the amount the pipe-line had received on\r\nMr. Rice’s shipments between March 20 and April 25. The agent was\r\ninstructed to send the money to the receiver, and later, by order of the\r\ncourt, the money was refunded to Mr. Rice. But the Standard was not out\r\nof the scrape so easily.\r\n\r\nReceiver Pease filed his report on November 2, but the judge found it\r\n“evasive and unsatisfactory,” and further information was asked for.\r\nFinally the judge succeeded in securing the correspondence between Mr.\r\nPease and Mr. Rapallo, quoted above, and enough other facts to show the\r\nnature of the discrimination. He lost no time in pronouncing a judgment,\r\nand he did not mince his words in doing it:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “But why should Rice be required to pay 250 per cent. more for the\r\n  carriage of his oil than was exacted from his competitor? The answer\r\n  is that thereby the receiver could increase his earnings. This\r\n  pretence is not true; but suppose it was, would that fact justify,\r\n  or even mitigate, the injustice done to Rice? May a receiver of a\r\n  court, in the management of a railroad, thus discriminate between\r\n  parties having equal claim upon him, because thereby he can\r\n  accumulate money for the litigants? It has been repeatedly adjudged\r\n  that he cannot legally do so. Railroads are constructed for the\r\n  common and equal benefit of all persons wishing to avail themselves\r\n  of the facilities which they afford. While the legal title thereof\r\n  is in the corporation of individuals owning them, and to that extent\r\n  private property, they are by the law and consent of the owners\r\n  dedicated to the public use. By its charter and the general\r\n  contemporaneous laws of the state which constitute the contract\r\n  between the public and the railroad company—the state, in\r\n  consideration of the undertaking of the corporators to build, equip,\r\n  keep in repair and operate said road for the public accommodation,\r\n  authorised it to demand reasonable compensation from everyone\r\n  availing himself of its facilities, for the service rendered. But\r\n  this franchise carried with it other and correlative obligations.\r\n\r\n  “Among these is the obligation to carry for every person offering\r\n  business under like circumstances, at the same rate. All unjust\r\n  discriminations are in violation of the sound public policy, and are\r\n  forbidden by law. We have had frequent occasions to enunciate and\r\n  enforce this doctrine in the past few years. If it were not so, the\r\n  managers of railways in collusion with others in command of large\r\n  capital could control the business of the country, at least to the\r\n  extent that the business was dependent on railroad transportation\r\n  for its success, and make and unmake the fortunes of men at will.\r\n\r\n  “The idea is justly abhorrent to all fair minds. No such dangerous\r\n  power can be tolerated. Except in the modes of using them, every\r\n  citizen has the same right to demand the service of railroads on\r\n  equal terms that they have to the use of a public highway or the\r\n  government mails. And hence when, in the vicissitudes of business, a\r\n  railroad corporation becomes insolvent and is seized by the court\r\n  and placed in the hands of a receiver to be by him operated pending\r\n  the litigation, and until the rights of the litigants can be\r\n  judicially ascertained and declared, the court is as much bound to\r\n  protect the public interests therein as it is to protect and enforce\r\n  the rights of the mortgagers and mortgagees. But after the receiver\r\n  has performed all obligations due the public and every member of\r\n  it—that is to say, after carrying passengers and freight offered,\r\n  for a reasonable compensation not exceeding the maximum authorised\r\n  by law, if such maximum rates shall have been prescribed, upon equal\r\n  terms to all, he may make for the litigants as much money as the\r\n  road thus managed is capable of earning.\r\n\r\n  “But all attempts to accumulate money for the benefit of corporators\r\n  or their creditors, by making one shipper pay tribute to his rival\r\n  in business at the rate of twenty-five dollars per day, or any\r\n  greater or less sum, thereby enriching one and impoverishing\r\n  another, is a gross, illegal, inexcusable abuse of a public trust\r\n  that calls for the severest reprehension. The discrimination\r\n  complained of in this case is so wanton and oppressive it could\r\n  hardly have been accepted by an honest man having due regard for the\r\n  rights of others, or conceded by a just and competent receiver who\r\n  comprehended the nature and responsibility of his office; and a\r\n  judge who would tolerate such a wrong or retain a receiver capable\r\n  of perpetrating it ought to be impeached and degraded from his\r\n  position.\r\n\r\n  “A good deal more might be said in condemnation of the unparalleled\r\n  wrong complained of, but we forbear. The receiver will be removed.\r\n  The matter will be referred to a master to ascertain and report the\r\n  amount that has been as aforesaid unlawfully exacted by the receiver\r\n  from Rice, which sum, when ascertained, will be repaid to him. The\r\n  master will also inquire and report whether any part of the money\r\n  collected by the receiver from Rice has been paid to the Standard\r\n  Oil Company, and if so—how much, to the end that, if any such\r\n  payments have been made, suit may be instituted for its\r\n  recovery.”[107]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 18 George K. Nash, a former governor of Ohio, was appointed\r\nmaster commissioner to take testimony and clear up the point doubtful in\r\nthe judge’s mind—to whom had the extra money paid by Rice been paid; the\r\nreceiver declared that he never paid the Standard Oil Company any part\r\nof Rice’s money. Mr. Nash summoned a large number of witnesses and\r\ngradually untangled the story told above. Mr. Pease spoke truly, he had\r\nnever paid the Standard Oil Company any part of Mr. Rice’s money. A\r\njoint agent of the railroad and the pipe-line had been appointed, at a\r\nsalary of eighty-five dollars a month, sixty dollars paid by Pease and\r\ntwenty-five dollars by the Standard, who collected the freight on\r\nindependent shipments and divided the money between the two parties. It\r\nwas from this agent that it was learned that, twelve days _after_ Judge\r\nBaxter ordered Receiver Pease to bring his contracts into court, the\r\nmoney paid on Mr. Rice’s oil had been returned by the Standard Oil\r\nCompany.[108] While the investigation in regard to Mr. Rice’s oil was\r\ngoing on, complaints came to Commissioner Nash from two other oil works\r\nat Marietta that they had been suffering a like discrimination for a\r\nmuch longer time. The commissioner investigated the cases and found the\r\ncomplaints justified. The Standard Oil Company had received $649.15 out\r\nof the money paid by one concern to the railroad for carrying its oil,\r\nand $639.75 out of the sum paid by another concern! Both of these sums\r\nwere returned by the Standard.[109]\r\n\r\nOf course the case aroused violent comment. In 1888 it came before the\r\nCongressional Committee which was investigating trusts, and an effort\r\nwas made to explain the twenty-five cents extra as a charge of the\r\npipe-line for carrying oil to the railway. Now, the practice in vogue in\r\nthe Oil Regions then and now is that the _purchaser of the oil pays the\r\npipe-line charge_. The railroad has nothing to do with it. Even if the\r\nStandard Oil Company puts a tax on railroads for allowing them to take\r\noil carried by its pipe-lines—thus collecting double pay—the tax would\r\nnot apply in Mr. Rice’s case, for the oil came to the Cincinnati and\r\nMarietta road not through Standard pipes but through Mr. Rice’s own\r\npipes. This much Mr. O’Day was obliged to admit in 1888:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But did that other oil which was in competition with you pass\r\n  through your pipe?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did not they, therefore, on that oil which only passed over\r\n  their railroad and not through your pipe-line, pay to you the same\r\n  allowance or rebate that they did on your oil which did pass?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They did, but we returned it through the advice of our counsel,\r\n  Mr. Dodd.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, out of that sum how much did you get from the railroad out\r\n  of what they had received from Mr. Rice?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We did not get any; that is, we did not retain any. The\r\n  railroad company agreed to account to us for the oil that went over\r\n  its lines, and they did make an accounting, to my recollection, of\r\n  about $200, or something like that, on oil other than that which\r\n  passed through the lines. Our counsel, Mr. Dodd, advised me that we\r\n  could not do that business, and we refunded the money.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after the report of the Congressional Committee was published John\r\nD. Rockefeller himself explained the case in an interview published in\r\nthe New York World for March 29, 1890: “When the arrangement was\r\nreported to the officers of the company at New York,” Mr. Rockefeller\r\ntold the interviewer, “it was not agreed to because our counsel\r\npronounced it illegal in so far as it embraced oil carried by the\r\npipe-line. Some $250 had been paid to the pipe-line under this contract\r\non oil which the line had not transported. This was refunded. We\r\nrepudiated the contract before it was passed upon by the courts and made\r\nfull recompense. In a business as large as ours, conducted by so many\r\nagents, some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve. We\r\ncorrect them as soon as they come to our knowledge. The public hears of\r\nthe wrong—it never hears of the correction.” In the Digest of Evidence\r\nmade by the Industrial Commission in its report published in 1900 (page\r\n158), it is stated that the money collected was refunded _before_ suit\r\nwas brought. The facts show that the statement in the report of the\r\nIndustrial Commission that the money was refunded _before_ suit was\r\nbrought is wrong, and that, while Mr. Rockefeller is technically correct\r\nin stating that the Standard repudiated the contract before it was\r\npassed on by the courts, he should have added they did not repudiate the\r\ncontract until _eight months after_ it was made, and did not refund the\r\nmoney until _twelve days after_ it became certain that the contract\r\nwould be produced in court. He also does not explain why the Standard\r\nOil Company did not return the money unjustly paid to them on the\r\nshipments of the other independent oil concerns of Marietta until\r\nexposure by Commissioner Nash’s investigation made it inevitable.[110]\r\n\r\nBut it was not only manipulation of the railroads by the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of which the public was complaining at this time. The policy of\r\nmaking it impossible for even small independent concerns to do business\r\nwas attracting more and more attention. Indeed, there was going on in\r\nBuffalo, New York, simultaneously with these two cases, a most\r\nsensational trial, growing out of an indictment for the crime of\r\nconspiracy, by the Grand Jury of Erie County, New York, of three\r\nprominent members of the Standard Oil Company—H. H. Rogers, John D.\r\nArchbold and Ambrose McGregor—with two refiners with whom they were\r\nassociated—H. B. Everest and C. M. Everest. The case is reported in the\r\nnext chapter at some length, because of the importance it has assumed in\r\nthe popular controversy which has been going on for the last twenty\r\nyears over “Standard methods,” it being the case on which is based the\r\noften-repeated charge that Mr. Rockefeller, to win his point, has been\r\nknown to burn refineries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER TWELVE\r\n                            THE BUFFALO CASE\r\n\r\n  THE STANDARD BUYS THREE-FOURTHS OF THE VACUUM OIL WORKS OF\r\n    ROCHESTER—TWO VACUUM EMPLOYEES ESTABLISH BUFFALO LUBRICATING OIL\r\n    COMPANY AND TAKE WITH THEM AN EXPERIENCED STILLMAN FROM THE\r\n    VACUUM—THE BUFFALO LUBRICATING OIL COMPANY HAS AN EXPLOSION AND THE\r\n    STILLMAN SUDDENLY LEAVES—THE BUFFALO LUBRICATING OIL COMPANY IS SUED\r\n    BY VACUUM FOR INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS—MATTHEWS SUES THE EVERESTS OF\r\n    THE VACUUM FOR DELIBERATELY TRYING TO RUIN HIS BUSINESS—MATTHEWS\r\n    WINS HIS FIRST CIVIL SUIT—HE FILES A SECOND SUIT FOR DAMAGES, AND\r\n    SECURES THE INDICTMENT OF SEVERAL STANDARD OFFICIALS FOR CRIMINAL\r\n    CONSPIRACY—ROGERS, ARCHBOLD AND McGREGOR ACQUITTED—THE EVERESTS\r\n    FINED.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery soon after Mr. Rockefeller began to “acquire” independent\r\nrefineries, whose owners were loath to sell or go out of business,\r\nunpleasant stories began to be circulated in the oil world of the\r\nmethods used in getting the offending plants out of the way. When\r\nfreight discriminations, cutting off of crude supply, and price wars in\r\nthe market failed, other means were tried, and these means included\r\nsometimes, it was whispered, the actual destruction of the plants. The\r\nonly case in which this charge was made which ever came to trial was\r\nthat of the Buffalo Lubricating Oil Company, Limited. For sake of\r\nclearness, a narrative of the case has been drawn from the testimony\r\noffered, no statements being admitted which were not brought out in the\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\nIt seems that some time in 1879 the owners of the Vacuum Oil Works, of\r\nRochester, New York—H. B. and C. M. Everest, father and son—sold to H.\r\nH. Rogers, J. D. Archbold and Ambrose McGregor of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, for $200,000, a three-fourths interest in that concern. The\r\npurchase was not made for the gentlemen in whose names it appeared, but\r\nfor the Standard. Thus, when on the witness-stand J. D. Archbold was\r\nquestioned as to the real ownership of the stock which had been bought\r\nin his name, the examiner wanted to know whether the purchasers\r\nrepresented themselves or somebody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Archbold,” he asked, “you made the contract, did you not, with\r\n  reference to the transfer of the seventy-five shares of the Vacuum\r\n  Oil Company’s stock by the Messrs. Everest?”\r\n\r\n  _A._ I bought the seventy-five shares, yes, sir.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Whom did you represent in that transaction?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I represented the shareholders of the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ After this purchase was made did you continue to represent the\r\n  purchasers in the management of the affairs of the Vacuum Oil\r\n  Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I did.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ By virtue of power delegated to you, or by virtue of being a\r\n  member of the board of directors or trustees of the Vacuum?\r\n\r\n  _A._ By the virtue of power delegated to me.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ By the purchasers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ By the purchasers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vacuum manufactured principally lubricating oils used on harness and\r\ncar wheels. It controlled several valuable patents and had been doing a\r\nprosperous business for a number of years. By the terms of the sale in\r\n1879 the Everests remained as managers of the refinery, on a salary of\r\n$10,000 a year. They also contracted to enter into no outside oil\r\nbusiness for ten years. The business policy of the Vacuum, including the\r\nfixing of salaries, was dictated by a board of directors made up of\r\nMessrs. Rogers, Archbold, McGregor and the two Everests. The meetings of\r\nthis board were held at the office of the Standard Oil Company, in New\r\nYork or in Rochester, as convenient.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be inferred from the testimony, the works were well\r\nmanaged, the dividends large, and the employees well treated. In 1880\r\nthe salesman of the concern, J. Scott Wilson, decided to leave the\r\nVacuum and go into business for himself. The decision seems natural, for\r\nuntil 1878 Mr. Wilson had carried on an independent oil business of one\r\nkind or another. He had been a partner in a refinery and understood\r\nmaking oils. He had been a jobber on his own account before going with\r\nthe Everests, and as such had had a considerable clientele. Wilson told\r\none of his fellow employees, Charles B. Matthews, of his decision, and\r\nasked him to go with him. Matthews had been with the Everests about the\r\nsame length of time as Wilson—some two years. Previous to this\r\nengagement he had been a farmer, and his acquaintance with the Vacuum\r\npeople had come about by his drilling on his farm for oil. Matthews was\r\nworth some $20,000, but he had had no experience in oil refining, for\r\nhis duties at the Vacuum had been mainly looking after outside\r\nbusiness—for instance, he had several times gone to New York to consult\r\nJ. D. Archbold and H. H. Rogers concerning business matters, and\r\nparticularly concerning patents owned by the Vacuum, of whose validity\r\nthere was some doubt. For some time Matthews had been dissatisfied with\r\nhis salary—he had asked for a raise, but had not got it—a fact which\r\nprobably made him more favourable to Wilson’s suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe two men decided finally to form a company and to build an oil\r\nrefinery at Buffalo. Wilson said on the witness-stand that he did not\r\nwant to handle the Vacuum processes in the new works, but to make only\r\nthe oils with which he was familiar. Matthews, however, had convinced\r\nhimself that the patents which covered certain of the Vacuum processes\r\nand apparatus were invalid, and insisted that they build at least one\r\nVacuum still. The question of what steps the Vacuum might take to stop\r\nthem was discussed, and according to Wilson’s testimony Matthews\r\nremarked that he expected they would pay $100,000 or $150,000 to prevent\r\ntheir going into business. Matthews’s remark was natural enough,\r\nconsidering the conditions under which outside refiners were forced to\r\ndo business. It is probable that no man undertook any kind of\r\nindependent oil business at that time, particularly oil refining,\r\nwithout considering the possibility of being driven to sell.\r\n\r\nThe new firm needed an experienced stillman accustomed to the Vacuum\r\nprocesses, and early in 1881 they asked one Albert Miller, a stillman in\r\nthe Vacuum works, to join them. “If we have Miller,” they told each\r\nother, “we can go to the customers of the Vacuum Oil Company and say to\r\nthem: ‘We have the same process and the same apparatus and the same oils\r\nas the Vacuum Oil Company, and we have their former superintendent, Mr.\r\nMiller, to manufacture the oils.’” Miller had been with the Everests for\r\nseveral years, having worked his way up from a labourer at two dollars a\r\nday to a position where, as stillman, he was paid by the hour, and\r\nearned from $1,200 to $1,400 a year. He and his wife had been thrifty,\r\nand had several thousand dollars in property. Miller thought there was\r\nmoney in the new venture, and consented to join Wilson and Matthews. The\r\nthree set about carrying out their plans before they notified their\r\nemployers of their intention to leave—Miller going so far as to order\r\ncertain iron castings needed in the construction of their works, made\r\nafter patterns owned by the Everests. He had these made at the foundry\r\npatronised by the Everests. He paid for them himself, and carried them\r\naway, presumably giving the impression that they were for his employers.\r\n\r\nEarly in March Matthews and Miller notified C. M. Everest, who was in\r\ncharge, his father being in California, that they were going to leave\r\nand establish at Buffalo an independent oil refinery. Mr. Everest,\r\nsurprised out of discretion by the news, told them plainly that although\r\nhe had nothing against them personally, he should do all in his power to\r\ninjure the proposed concern. He asked them where they expected to get\r\noil, and they replied that they would get it from the Atlas Refining\r\nCompany, an independent concern in Buffalo, which had its own pipe-line.\r\n“You will wake up some morning and find it is in the Standard,” replied\r\nMr. Everest. Apparently Mr. Everest’s threat had little influence on the\r\nmen, for they pushed the building of the works in Buffalo as rapidly as\r\npossible. On March 15 they signed an agreement to carry on the proposed\r\nbusiness for five years, each man to put in $2,000. A month later the\r\nthree men, with two relatives of Matthews, organised a stock company—the\r\nBuffalo Lubricating Oil Company, Limited—with a capital of $40,000.\r\n\r\nAlthough Miller had gone to Buffalo the first of March with Matthews and\r\nWilson, he returned frequently to Rochester to see his family. On\r\nseveral of these visits he saw C. M. Everest, who never failed to ask\r\nabout the progress of the new concern, and to warn him that the Vacuum\r\nCompany would never allow it to do business. “Don’t you think, Miller,”\r\nEverest said to him once, “that it would be better for you to leave\r\nthose men and have $20,000 deposited to your wife’s credit than to go to\r\nthese parties?” Miller affirms that he answered that he had gone with\r\nthe new firm in good faith, and thought he ought not to leave them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLEACHING TANK\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CONSTRUCTING AN IRON TANK FOR STORING OIL\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OIL AGITATORS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIVE-BARREL STILL USED IN THE FIFTIES IN DISTILLING CRUDE OIL AS A\r\n    LUMINANT\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbout two months after the new firm began building, the elder Everest,\r\nwho had been in California, returned to Rochester, and soon after had\r\nseveral interviews with Miller. He impressed on the man, as his son had\r\ndone, that the Buffalo Lubricating Works would never succeed. He told\r\nhim that the Vacuum meant to bring suit against them for infringing\r\ntheir patents, and would get an injunction and stop the works; that\r\nMiller would lose all the money he had put in. To save himself, Everest\r\nadvised Miller to come back to the Vacuum. “But that would leave them in\r\na pretty bad fix,” Miller said. “That is exactly what I want to do,”\r\nreplied Everest. The fear that the new concern might be ruined through\r\nthe hostility of the Vacuum, and he lose his savings, seems to have\r\npreyed on Miller’s mind. He took his wife into his confidence, and she,\r\ntoo, became alarmed. He began to neglect his work in Buffalo. He was\r\noften away at nights. Matthews began to be worried by Miller’s neglect\r\nand absence, and to watch the stations to find, if possible, where he\r\nwent. Miller’s question now became, how could he get away from the\r\nBuffalo firm? He had signed for the company a note for $5,000. He was\r\nunder contract for a term of years. He discussed the question with the\r\nEverests, and they advised him to see his lawyer. On the seventh of\r\nJune, according to H. B. Everest,[111] who went with him to help present\r\nthe case, Miller did consult George Truesdale, a lawyer of Rochester,\r\nwho had always handled his business. Mr. Truesdale afterwards told in\r\ncourt what occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Everest stated that Miller had left his employ, and got engaged\r\n  with another oil concern in the City of Buffalo; that he desired to\r\n  get back again; he wanted him to come back; and he said he supposed\r\n  Miller had explained to me his situation, and the obligations he was\r\n  under to the Buffalo company. I told him that he had made some\r\n  statements to me about his contract with the parties in Buffalo;\r\n  that he had spoken about being an endorser or party to the note made\r\n  by, I think he said, Matthews and Wilson and himself, and I think\r\n  another party—four or five of them had made, endorsed a note to\r\n  raise money, done to start the Buffalo business, and that he had a\r\n  contract or an arrangement with them to go into a company at Buffalo\r\n  to manufacture oil, and that he wanted to know how he could get out\r\n  of that arrangement. I stated what I had said to Miller, that he\r\n  would, of course, be liable on the note, if he was _charged_\r\n  properly when it became due, and that if he wanted to get out of\r\n  that arrangement my advice to him had been to see if he couldn’t get\r\n  released; if they wouldn’t release him or buy out his interest;\r\n  then, if he couldn’t do that, the only other way I saw was for him\r\n  to leave them and take the consequences. I told him that I did not\r\n  know the exact terms of his contract, but, if he had entered into a\r\n  contract and violated it, I presumed there would be a liability for\r\n  damages, as well as a liability for the debts of the Buffalo party.\r\n  Mr. Miller and Everest both talked on the subject, and Mr. Everest\r\n  says, ‘I think there is other ways for Miller to get out of it.’ I\r\n  told him I saw no way except either to back out or to sell out; no\r\n  other honourable way. Mr. Everest says, substantially, I think, in\r\n  these words: ‘Suppose he should arrange the machinery so it would\r\n  bust up, or smash up, what would the consequences be?’—something to\r\n  that effect. ‘Well,’ I says, ‘in my opinion, if it is negligently,\r\n  carelessly done, not purposely done, he would be only civilly liable\r\n  for damages caused by his negligence; but if it was wilfully done,\r\n  there would be a further criminal liability for malicious injury to\r\n  the property of the parties, the company.’ Mr. Everest said he\r\n  thought there wouldn’t be anything only civil liability, and said\r\n  that would—he referred to the fact that I had been police justice,\r\n  had some experience in criminal law—and he said that he would like\r\n  to have me look up the law carefully on that point, and that they\r\n  would see me again.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMiller’s version of this interview is similar:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I think Mr. Truesdale or myself, I am not positive which, asked the\r\n  question what means I could take to get out of the company. H. B.\r\n  says, ‘There is a good many ways he could get out.’ Either Mr.\r\n  Truesdale or myself asked him how. ‘Well,’ he says, ‘he can cut up\r\n  something or do something to injure them; something of that kind, to\r\n  get out’; H. B. said this. Mr. Truesdale spoke up and said, ‘You\r\n  must be very careful what you do or you will lay yourself criminally\r\n  liable.’ Mr. Everest says to me, ‘There is ways that you can get\r\n  out.’ I says to him, ‘You wouldn’t want me to do anything, would\r\n  you, to lay myself liable?’ I think Mr. Truesdale spoke up and says,\r\n  ‘You must be very careful or you will end in state’s prison,’—that\r\n  is, I. There was considerable conversation I cannot just exactly\r\n  remember; I have told all I recollect at present. Mr. Truesdale\r\n  asked me if I had a contract with the Buffalo parties; I told him I\r\n  had; ‘Well,’ he says, ‘the best thing you can do is to stay there,\r\n  then,’ or something of that kind. I cannot say those were his exact\r\n  words. H. B. Everest says, ‘If he comes back with us, why, we will\r\n  look after him.’ I think Mr. Truesdale said that these men would be\r\n  after me for leaving them. I think I told him the terms of the\r\n  contract.... Mr. Everest says, ‘They will have to catch Miller\r\n  before they can do anything to him; we will take care of him.’”[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a talk with Miller a little while after this, C. M. Everest said to\r\nhim: “You go back to Buffalo and construct the pipes so that they cannot\r\nmake a good oil, and then, I think, if you would give them a little\r\nscare. You might scare them a little, they not knowing anything about\r\nthe business, and you know how to do it.” On account of Miller’s\r\nneglect, the first still in the new refinery was not ready to be fired\r\nuntil June 15—it was an ordinary still, as was the second one built—the\r\nthird only was built for the Vacuum process. As soon as the still was\r\nready it was filled with some 175 barrels of crude oil and a very hot\r\nfire—“inordinary hot” was the droll description of the fireman—built\r\nunder it. Miller, who superintended the operations, swore at the fireman\r\nonce or twice because the fire was not hot enough, and then disappeared.\r\nWhile he was gone the brickwork around the still began to crack. The\r\nsafety valve finally blew off, and a yellow gas or vapour escaped in\r\nsuch quantities that the superintendent of a neighbouring refinery came\r\nout and warned the fireman that he was endangering property. Miller was\r\nhunted up. He had the safety valve readjusted—it was thought by certain\r\nwitnesses that he had it too heavily weighted—and ordered the fires to\r\nbe rebuilt, hot as before. He again disappeared. In his absence the\r\nsafety valve again blew off. The run of oil was found to be a failure.\r\nIt was not a pleasant augury, but oil refiners are more or less hardened\r\nto explosions and no one seems to have thought much of the accident.\r\nNobody was injured; nothing was burned, nothing but 175 barrels of oil\r\nspoiled; that, in an oil refinery, is getting off easy.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of June Miller made the transfer of property advised by the\r\nEverests, talked over things with Truesdale, and a week later left the\r\nBuffalo Works suddenly on receipt of a telegram, and joined H. B.\r\nEverest at the Union Square Hotel in New York. Here Everest advised him\r\nto telegraph his wife to move at once to Rochester lest Matthews attach\r\ntheir household goods, and then proposed the two go to Boston. The only\r\nevent of interest at the Union Square Hotel was an entirely casual\r\nmeeting with H. H. Rogers, one of the directors of the Vacuum Oil\r\nCompany. Mr. Rogers seems to have had no conversation with Miller other\r\nthan to remark, in leaving, that he would see him the next day if he did\r\nnot go to Boston. The men did, however, go to Boston, where they\r\nregistered as “H. B. Everest and friend,” and where several times, at\r\nleast, Everest introduced Miller under an assumed name. They junketed\r\nabout for some days on what Everest tried, with indifferent success, to\r\npersuade Miller was a pleasure excursion! While they were amusing\r\nthemselves, Everest hired Miller at $1,500 a year to “do any fair job we\r\nput him at, either at Rochester or some other place.” The job turned out\r\nto be a rambling one—a few weeks of semi-idleness in Boston—then nothing\r\nuntil September, when he undertook to supervise the drilling of a salt\r\nwell in Leroy, New York. This lasted until February, 1882; then nothing\r\nuntil May, when, on the advice of H. B. Everest, who had returned to\r\nCalifornia, Miller went there: “Pack up, sell your property there and\r\ncome on. Come right to my house and I will help you to get a place and\r\nshow you how to raise fruit and be an independent man.” Miller went, the\r\nVacuum Oil Company paying his expenses. On his arrival he was put to\r\nwork in a cannery. The Everests explained that they made this\r\narrangement because they thought it would put Miller where he could not\r\nbe brought back to trouble them any more.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime things were going badly with the Buffalo Lubricating\r\nWorks. Miller’s loss was a severe one. The men were all novices in\r\nmaking oil, save Wilson, and he was on the road, and they seem to have\r\nbeen unable to find a competent manager. The Everests soon succeeded,\r\ntoo, in getting Wilson out of the new firm by bringing a suit against\r\nhim for damaging its business by unlawfully leaving it. The suit was\r\nwithdrawn and the costs paid, when Wilson consented, in December, 1881,\r\nto leave the Buffalo Works. Wilson’s loss was particularly serious, as\r\nhe was a salesman of experience.\r\n\r\nThe suits for infringing the Vacuum patents and processes, which Everest\r\nat the start had warned Matthews would be brought, were begun in\r\nSeptember, 1881—four separate suits within a year. Matthews, as has been\r\nsaid, had convinced himself that the patents were not valid, and some\r\ntime in the spring of 1882 he saw H. H. Rogers in New York concerning\r\nthe suits. “I told him I had come in to talk with him about the patent\r\nlitigation, or suits that were begun by the Vacuum Oil Company against\r\nmy company,” Matthews said in his testimony. “‘Well,’ he said, ‘well,\r\nwhat about it?’—something like that. I told him that the product patent,\r\nthat I well knew, was without merit, and that he knew it was without\r\nmerit, and I could not see what object or good they could get out of it\r\nby bringing suit on that patent. And also the steam patent I considered\r\nwas without value, and that he knew it was without value. He said that\r\nif one court did not sustain the patents they would carry along up until\r\nwe got enough of it—that was the substance of that talk.”\r\n\r\nMatthews was evidently discouraged by the result of his talk with Mr.\r\nRogers, for, meeting Benjamin Brewster, of the Standard Oil Company, he\r\noffered to sell the Buffalo Lubricating Works for $100,000. The offer\r\nwas refused, and the suits against which Mr. Matthews protested were\r\npushed. On the 21st of February, 1882, the Vacuum Oil Company filed a\r\ncomplaint in the United States Circuit Court of the Northern District of\r\nNew York, asking that the Buffalo company be prevented from\r\nmanufacturing lubricating oils, on the ground that the Vacuum Oil\r\nCompany had a patent covering the process of manufacturing lubricating\r\noils. The action was regarded as unfounded by the court, and was\r\ndismissed on July 16, 1884, “the ground being that the letters sued on\r\nin this cause are void.” April 25, 1882, another action was commenced by\r\nthe Vacuum Oil Company against the Buffalo company to obtain an\r\ninjunction and an accounting for damages upon the ground that the\r\nBuffalo company was using an apparatus covered by a patent belonging to\r\nthe Vacuum Oil Company, but this action also was dismissed March 17,\r\n1885, upon the ground that the letters patent sued upon were “null and\r\nvoid.” On February 23, 1883, the Vacuum Oil Company commenced still\r\nanother action against the Buffalo company asking for an injunction to\r\nprevent the Buffalo company from using a label advertising “The Acme\r\nHarness Oil made by the Vacuum Process,” because the Vacuum Company had\r\nlong used a somewhat similar label advertising “The Vacuum Harness Oil\r\nmanufactured by Vacuum Oil Company,” but the judge in the case decided\r\nthat the Vacuum Company had no more right to use labels than the Buffalo\r\ncompany. This decision has since been affirmed by the General Term of\r\nthe Supreme Court. Still another action was brought against the Buffalo\r\ncompany April 25, 1882, for infringing a patent on a steam process, also\r\na patent upon a fire test. This action resulted in a decree sustaining\r\nthe fire-test patent, but declaring the steam patent void. The case was\r\nthen referred to James Breck Perkins, of the Rochester bar, to decide\r\nthe amount which the Buffalo company had infringed on this patent. Mr.\r\nPerkins on a number of different occasions took a large amount of proof\r\nthere in behalf of the Vacuum Company upon which its counsel claimed\r\nthat it was entitled to $12,000 damages upon the accounting. The Buffalo\r\ncompany submitted no proof in contradiction, but insisted that the whole\r\nproof showed nothing more than a purely technical infringement of the\r\npatent, and this view was sustained by Mr. Perkins in his report which\r\nawarded six cents damages against the Buffalo company.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Miller, the man on whom the firm had depended for\r\nsuperintending building and refining, the withdrawal of Wilson, with\r\nwhom the enterprise had originated and on which it had staked its hopes\r\nof finding a ready market, and the series of suits for infringement of\r\npatents, suits which cost Matthews thousands of dollars as well as much\r\nembarrassment and delay, were troubles brought on him, so he believed,\r\nas the result of a deliberate attempt on the part of the Vacuum Oil\r\nCompany to make good C. M. Everest’s threat to do all in his power to\r\nruin the Buffalo Lubricating Works, and, in the spring of 1883, he\r\nbrought a civil suit against the Everests for $100,000. While Matthews\r\nwas working up his case he learned that Miller had returned from\r\nCalifornia, that he had left the Everests because he claimed they had\r\n“not treated him right,” and that he was idle in Rochester. Miller seems\r\nto have left California chiefly because he had gotten it into his head\r\nthat the information he had about the measures the Vacuum had taken to\r\nprevent the Buffalo Works carrying on their business was valuable. H. B.\r\nEverest testified that Miller once said to him after he was settled in\r\nCalifornia: “Mr. Everest, you have always been kind to me, and I shall\r\ndo nothing to injure you, but I am going to bust the Standard.” I said:\r\n“Al, how will you go to work to do that?” “More ways than one,” he said;\r\n“they can’t afford to let me loose,” he said. “Sha’n’t be bought off,\r\neither, unless I get something for it. It will cost them more than\r\ntwenty-five or fifty thousand dollars before they get through with me.”\r\nI said: “Al, I think you can make more money raising fruit in California\r\nthan you can fighting the Standard.” This conversation was held\r\nimmediately after the Vacuum had paid Miller $1,000, in addition to the\r\nsalary of $1,500 they gave him, and for no apparent purpose except to\r\nkeep him quiet.\r\n\r\nWhen Matthews learned of Miller’s return he asked him to come to\r\nBuffalo, and evidently got from him then, for the first time, the story\r\nof the pressure the Everests had brought to bear on him to leave the\r\nBuffalo Lubricating Works, the “fixing” of the still at their advice so\r\nthat something would “smash,” the transfer of his property, his two\r\nyears of semi-idleness on $1,500 a year and a bonus of $1,000, paid for\r\na reason which can only be surmised, and his final breaking in\r\nCalifornia, because, as he claimed, he saw no settled employment in view\r\nand no prospect of the Everests doing more for him than they were, and,\r\nas they claimed, because he believed he could get a big sum from the\r\nStandard to keep silent. To all of this Miller made deposition in July,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nThe first civil suit was brought to trial early in March, 1885, and it\r\nresulted in the jury giving a verdict of $20,000 to Matthews for\r\ndamages. The court set the sum aside, claiming that they had proved only\r\n$4,000 in damages and that he would not sustain an award of punitive\r\ndamages. Matthews’s counsel now obtained a stay of proceedings and\r\nfinally a new trial. Now about this time Matthews secured evidence which\r\nemboldened him to give his suit a much wider range than he had at first\r\nintended. This was the testimony of the lawyer Truesdale, quoted above,\r\nthat in his office Everest had suggested that Miller “arrange the\r\nmachinery so that it would bust up or smash up.” The explosion of June\r\n15 was immediately construed as the result of this counsel. On the\r\nstrength of this evidence Matthews instituted a second civil suit for\r\ndamages of $250,000 caused by conspiracy to blow up the works of the\r\nBuffalo company, to entice away its employees, to bring unfounded suits\r\nagainst it, and to slander the company’s product, and he added to the\r\noriginal defendants the three other directors of the Vacuum Works—H. H.\r\nRogers, J. D. Archbold and Ambrose McGregor—and the Standard Oil Company\r\nof New York, the Acme Oil Company of New York and the Vacuum Oil\r\nCompany. Matthews seems to have argued that, as Rogers, Archbold and\r\nMcGregor were directors with the Everests in the Vacuum Oil Company,\r\nthey had probably been consulted by the Everests concerning Miller, and\r\ncould be included in the conspiracy, and, as the Vacuum, Standard Oil\r\nCompany and Acme Oil Company were all concerns in the Standard Oil\r\nTrust, they, too, could be included. He also went before the Grand Jury\r\nof Erie County in opposition to the advice of his counsel and secured\r\nthere an indictment of H. H. Rogers, J. D. Archbold, Ambrose McGregor\r\nand the two Everests for criminal conspiracy. The defendants succeeded\r\nin getting the indictment set aside the first time, but Matthews\r\nrepresented the case, and a second indictment was found of the same\r\npersons. It should be noted that Mr. McGregor was indicted only because\r\nhe was a director of the Vacuum Works, his name not being mentioned in\r\nthe evidence presented to the Grand Jury.\r\n\r\nAn indictment for conspiracy of three men of such prominence as Mr.\r\nRogers, Mr. Archbold and Mr. McGregor riveted the attention of the whole\r\ncountry on the coming trial. It was apparent from the first that the\r\nStandard meant to put up a big fight to have the indictment quashed.\r\nThey had, indeed, set a strong machinery at work immediately to get\r\nevidence on which to bring a counter charge of conspiracy; that is, that\r\nMatthews’s intention in starting the Buffalo Lubricating Works was never\r\nto do business, but to force the Standard to buy him out at a big price.\r\nThey at once set a detective to work on the case, one item of his\r\ninstructions reading: “We have reason to believe that the suit is\r\nbrought for the purpose of forcing the Standard to purchase the works of\r\nthe Buffalo Lubricating Company, and Matthews has made certain\r\nstatements to that effect; would like reports of any statements or\r\nadmissions by him in relation to his objects in these suits.” Under the\r\ndirection of this detective, a man employed in Matthews’s works for some\r\nmonths made daily reports of what he saw and heard there, copies of\r\nwhich were forwarded to the Standard office in New York. A detective was\r\nalso put on Miller’s track. Miller was now employed in a refinery in\r\nCorry, Pennsylvania, and here he was for a long time under espionage.\r\nThe chief expression obtained from him was by luring him into a saloon\r\none Sunday afternoon and getting him half drunk. While in this\r\ncondition, the saloon-keeper testified, he said the Buffalo suit was a\r\n—— humbug, but there was money in it and that they (he and the persons\r\nwho were drinking with him) might as well make it as anybody.\r\n\r\nIt was on May 2, 1886, that the trial began. The array of wealth and\r\nlegal learning in the Buffalo court-room during the fourteen days’ case\r\nset not only the town, but the country agape. There were not only the\r\nStandard men indicted for conspiracy—H. H. Rogers, J. D. Archbold,\r\nAmbrose McGregor—but Mr. Rockefeller himself was there, quiet, steady,\r\nwatchful. The hostile said the accused and their counsel were disdainful\r\nof the proceedings—nobody charged Mr. Rockefeller with disdain. With him\r\nwere other strong men of the concern, William Rockefeller, Daniel O’Day,\r\nJ. P. Dudley. There was a great array of legal learning—five eminent\r\nlawyers—Wilson S. Bissell, a former law partner of ex-President\r\nCleveland; W. F. Cogswell, of Rochester, counted then one of the ablest\r\nlawyers of the state; Theodore Bacon and F. G. Outerbridge, both of\r\nRochester; Daniel Lockwood, famous in politics as well as law; and, of\r\ncourse, S. C. T. Dodd. This for the accused. For the people was the\r\ndistrict-attorney of Erie County, George T. Quinby, with one assistant.\r\nFor fourteen days witnesses were examined, and the above story was\r\ndragged from them by dint of questioning and cross-questioning. On May\r\n10 the testimony for the prosecution ended, and the “people rested.” The\r\nStandard lawyers immediately applied for the acquittal of Mr. Rogers,\r\nMr. Archbold and Mr. McGregor, on the ground that no fact or\r\ncircumstance had been proved that connected them in the slightest degree\r\nwith the charge of conspiracy to lure Miller away or to destroy the\r\nBuffalo Works. The district-attorney combated the proposition\r\nvigorously. These gentlemen, he contended, owned three-fourths of the\r\nVacuum Works; they were always present at directors’ meetings; it was a\r\nfair presumption that they knew what was done to persuade Miller to\r\nleave the Buffalo Works; they must have known the moneys paid him while\r\nhe was doing little work. Mr. Rogers had certainly threatened Matthews\r\nthat he would carry up the patent suits until the Buffalo Works got\r\nenough of it. Judge Haight, however, advised the jury to acquit Mr.\r\nRogers, Mr. Archbold and Mr. McGregor. “The indictment charges a\r\nconspiracy,” the judge said. “It also charges certain overt acts. One of\r\nthe acts charged in the indictment is the enticing away from the Buffalo\r\ncompany of a servant. Another of the acts alleged is an attempt to blow\r\nup or destroy the Buffalo Works, and another act that of bringing false\r\nsuits against the corporation. So far as the agreement or combination to\r\nentice away a servant from the Buffalo company is concerned, I have not\r\nbeen able to recall any evidence which shows that either of these three\r\ndefendants ever knew of it, ever heard of it, or ever took any part in\r\nit at all. So far as the charge of an attempt to blow up the Buffalo\r\nWorks is concerned, I have been unable to recall any evidence that has\r\nbeen given in which either of these three defendants ever knew of it,\r\never heard of it, ever advised it, or ever took any part in it whatever.\r\nThe only thing about which I have had any doubt was in reference to the\r\nmaintaining of actions which have been brought upon patent rights which\r\nwere formerly owned by the Everests, and by the Everests transferred to\r\nthe Vacuum Oil Company, and it appears that two suits were brought upon\r\npatents, and that there was another suit, a third one, in reference to a\r\ntrade-mark. It appears from the evidence that upon one occasion Mr.\r\nMatthews went to New York and had a talk with Mr. Rogers, and that his\r\nconversation has already been discussed and related in your hearing. The\r\nquery in my mind was as to whether or not the inference could not be\r\ndrawn, from this conversation, that Rogers did know of the bringing of\r\nthese actions, acquiesced in their being brought, and in that way became\r\na party to them; but, even conceding that the actions were brought with\r\nhis knowledge and consent, I am inclined still to think that the\r\nevidence is hardly sufficient to warrant his conviction, for the reason\r\nthat it does not appear that the actions were brought without probable\r\ncause; in other words, the bringing of an action and being defeated in\r\nthe action is not of itself sufficient to authorise a jury to say that\r\nit was a false action. That standing alone is not sufficient to\r\nauthorise a jury to say that it is a false action, but there must be\r\nshown in addition to that that there was a want of probable cause; in\r\nother words, that the party bringing the action knew and understood\r\nbeforehand that he had no good cause of action.... I am inclined to the\r\nopinion that the evidence would not warrant his conviction upon that\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nThe acquittal of the three Standard gentlemen was followed by an\r\napplication for the acquittal of the Everests, but the case with them\r\nwas different. It had been proved conclusively that they threatened at\r\nthe start to ruin the new concern, and that they had counselled Miller\r\n“to arrange the machinery so it would bust up or smash up”; there was a\r\nstrong presumption that Miller, acting on this advice, had arranged for\r\nthe explosion of June 15, though, as he claimed, he meant only to “give\r\nthem a scare.” The judge denied the application in their case,\r\ntherefore, and the trial went on. The whole force of the defence was now\r\nthrown to proving that Matthews had gone into the Buffalo Lubricating\r\nCompany merely to sell out. His offer to Mr. Brewster in 1882, his talk\r\nof making the Standard settle, were rehearsed. Two witnesses were\r\nproduced also who told of seeking Matthews in 1885, after the criminal\r\nsuit was brought, and of offering, on the ground that they knew the\r\nStandard defendants, to attempt to settle the affair. Matthews had told\r\nthese men that if the Standard would give him $250,000 for his refinery,\r\nhe would withdraw the civil suit, but that he could not touch the\r\ncriminal suit, as it was in the hands of the district-attorney. The jury\r\nwas not greatly influenced by the evidence produced to show that\r\nMatthews was a blackmailer. Evidently they concluded that, granting that\r\nthe Everests had cause of complaint against the men for using their\r\nprocesses—they certainly had no just cause in the fact of the three men\r\nsetting up in business for themselves—granting that the enterprise was\r\nstarted for blackmailing purposes—and there was no proof offered that it\r\nwas—the Everests should have taken their case into the courts—not\r\nplotted the destruction of the refinery by any such underhand methods as\r\nthey employed. Whatever the jury’s process of reasoning, however, it is\r\ncertain that on May 16 they brought in a verdict of “guilty as charged\r\nby the indictment.”\r\n\r\nThe most strenuous efforts were made to set the verdict aside. The judge\r\ngranted a stay, and an attempt to get a new trial was made, but\r\nunsuccessfully. The sentence was stayed until May, 1888. The statute\r\nprovided a penalty of one year’s imprisonment or $250 fine, or both.\r\nEfforts were at once made to soften the sentence. A petition signed by\r\nover forty “leading citizens” of Rochester, New York, the home of the\r\nEverests, was sent to Judge Haight, praying him, on account of the\r\n“untarnished fidelity and integrity” of the convicted men, to make the\r\npenalty as light as the court was authorised by law to fix. Six of the\r\njurors were induced by Standard agents to sign a paper claiming that in\r\ntheir belief the jury in rendering its verdict of guilty did not mean to\r\npronounce the Everests guilty of an attempt to blow up or burn the works\r\nof the Buffalo company, but guilty only of enticing Miller away, and\r\nthey recommended that the sentence, therefore, be a fine and not\r\nimprisonment. District-Attorney Quinby offered to prove on a hearing for\r\na new trial that the Standard’s representatives used money in getting\r\nthese affidavits. The result was that the two Everests were each fined\r\n$250. This sentence was made light, the judge explained, because of the\r\ncivil suits brought to recover damages for the very same acts—a person\r\ncould not be punished twice for the same offence.\r\n\r\nThe first civil suit referred to above resulted in an award by the jury\r\nof $20,000 to Matthews. The second civil suit was for $250,000, but\r\nbefore it was tried Matthews’s business had become so involved by all\r\nthis trouble that in January, 1888, it was put into the hands of a\r\nreceiver. The defendants finally offered to settle the civil suits for\r\n$85,000. The judge ordered the receiver to accept the offer, on the\r\nground that the Everests had already been declared guilty of criminal\r\nconspiracy and had been fined, and that a person could not be punished\r\ntwice for the same offence!\r\n\r\nIt was not until June, 1889, that the receiver filed his account of the\r\nsettlement of the affairs of the Buffalo Works. Of the $85,000 paid by\r\nthe Standard, Matthews seems not to have gotten a cent. The entire sum\r\nwent to settle the debts of the concern and pay the lawyers. The leading\r\nclaimants among the lawyers were Thomas Corlett, Edward W. Hatch and\r\nAdelbert Moot, all of Buffalo. Their claims aggregated nearly $35,000.\r\nThe receiver thought these fees exorbitant, and a referee was appointed\r\nby the court to take the testimony of the claimant as to their services.\r\nThe testimony was voluminous, and the upshot was that the referee cut\r\nthese claims to about $22,000. The final account filed by the receiver\r\nshows that the three gentlemen finally were paid about $15,000.\r\n\r\nThe large claims made by the lawyers and certain circumstances of the\r\nsettlement have led the Standard, in later years, to advance a counter\r\ncharge of conspiracy of much more serious nature than that which they\r\ndepended on in the trial. This new charge makes Matthews’s counsel his\r\nfellow conspirators, and alleges that at least two of them used\r\nimportant official positions to influence the verdict. In the present\r\nyear (1904) the Standard’s official organ, the Oil City Derrick,\r\npublished a supplement containing the evidence on which this counter\r\ncharge is based, and editorially accused the writer of bias in not using\r\nthis material in the story of the Buffalo case which was published\r\npractically as it stands here in McClure’s Magazine for March, 1904. It\r\nis true, as the Derrick claims, that through the courtesy of the\r\nStandard Oil Company this material was placed in the writer’s hands\r\nbefore the article was published. It was not used because it was not\r\nthought it established the charge.\r\n\r\nThe points brought out in the evidence published by the Derrick which\r\nare held by the Standard to establish the charge of a conspiracy between\r\nMatthews and his counsel are the following: In the first place, they\r\ndeclare it a conspiracy because Corlett, who was called to the bench in\r\nJanuary, 1884, and Hatch, who was called to the bench in January, 1886,\r\nwere both in consultation with their successors after they became\r\njudges. That this is true there is no doubt whatever. Mr. Moot in his\r\nfull statement of his services made to the referee refers again and\r\nagain to consultations with Corlett and Hatch after they had given up\r\nthe case. Hatch speaks freely in his statement to the referee of\r\ncounselling with Quinby and Moot.[113] If there was an impropriety in\r\nwhat he did, he certainly made no effort to conceal it, nor did the\r\nreferee, the court, or the receiver, to whom this statement was\r\nsubmitted, raise any question of impropriety. The counsel which both\r\nJudge Corlett and Judge Hatch gave Quinby and Moot they owed Matthews.\r\nThey had been his counsel for years. They were obliged to give up his\r\ncases because of their election to the bench. They were debarred by\r\ntheir relation to the case, of course, from hearing it, but there was no\r\nreason why their knowledge and experience should not be drawn upon to a\r\nreasonable degree by the new attorneys. Certainly this is a universal\r\npractice in law courts. It is difficult to see how it could be\r\notherwise. If either judge had used his position to influence his fellow\r\njudge who heard the case there would be a just criticism, but no such\r\nintimation has ever been made, to the writer’s knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe second proof of conspiracy drawn from this testimony to the referee\r\nis the statements of both Hatch and Moot that they had no contracts for\r\ncompensation and that they knew they would receive nothing if they lost.\r\nFor instance, when Moot was examined by the referee he was asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you have any contract or agreement as to how you should be\r\n  compensated?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not the slightest. I never had such a contract in my life,\r\n  except that I should be liberally paid if I succeeded. If I did not\r\n  succeed, the party being poor, my work would be without\r\n  compensation....\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you ever have any conversation with Matthews or with any\r\n  officer of the company with reference to that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir. I feel very clear that I never had a conversation with\r\n  a single member of this company about what we should receive for our\r\n  services, except to this extent: Mr. Matthews once said, in\r\n  referring to or commenting on these litigations, that they were like\r\n  any other independent company, as I very well knew; that if the\r\n  lawyers could not keep them alive with litigation, the Standard\r\n  would beat them—we would not get anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Hatch in his statement said: “Matthews and I or any one for his\r\ncompany never had any talk with respect to compensation for services at\r\nthe time of their commencement or during their rendition. I knew,\r\nhowever, that the payment for services was largely contingent upon the\r\nsuccess of the litigation, and the company was not able to pay much more\r\nthan the actual expenses in the event they failed to succeed, and that\r\nwe would get a very meagre compensation unless we succeeded in the\r\nactions. I think no conversation was ever had except Mr. Matthews\r\nstating that if we should succeed we should be well paid. I think he\r\nmentioned that once or twice.”\r\n\r\nIt is not an unusual thing for lawyers to take cases they believe just,\r\nknowing that their compensation depends on their winning. Many clients\r\nwith just cases would be deprived of counsel if they had to insure a\r\nfixed compensation, for not infrequently all that a client has is\r\ninvolved in a suit. The practice is so common among reputable lawyers\r\nthat it certainly cannot be regarded as a proof of a conspiracy, unless\r\nthere is a reason to suppose that they have taken a case of whose merits\r\nthey themselves are suspicious. There is absolutely no evidence that\r\nMatthews’s counsel were not convinced from the first that they had a\r\nstrong case. Quinby, the district-attorney who tried the criminal case,\r\ncertainly conducted it with a fire and a logic which nothing but\r\nconviction could have inspired. Moreover, it must be remembered that\r\nthese attorneys never failed to convince the juries before whom they\r\nappeared of the merits of their case. Four juries, two grand juries and\r\ntwo petit juries gave unanimous verdicts of conspiracy against the\r\ndefendants in the course of the litigation. A case backed by evidence\r\nwhich would convince such diversified bodies of men could hardly be\r\ncalled a speculation. Their claims were large, but lawyers are not\r\nproverbial for the modesty of their charges, and in the cases of Hatch\r\nand Moot, the two making the largest claims, the labour had been very\r\ngreat and had extended over long periods, as one can see who will\r\nexamine the testimony published by the Derrick; and besides, exorbitant\r\ncharges can hardly be construed as a proof of conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThis, then, in outline, is the history of the case on which are based\r\nall charges, so far as the writer knows, that the Standard Oil Company\r\nhas deliberately destroyed property to get rid of rivals. The case is of\r\nimportance not only as showing to what abuses the Standard policy of\r\nmaking it hard for a rival to do business will lead men like the\r\nEverests, but it shows to what lengths a hostile public will go in\r\ninterpreting the acts of men whom it has come to believe are lawless and\r\nrelentless in pursuing their own ends. The public, particularly the oil\r\npublic, has always been willing to believe the worst of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. It read into the Buffalo case deliberate arson, and charged not\r\nonly the Everests, but the three co-directors, with the overt acts. They\r\nrefused to recognise that no evidence of the connection of Mr. Rogers,\r\nMr. Archbold and Mr. McGregor with the overt acts was offered, but\r\ndemanded that they be convicted on presumption, and when the judge\r\nrefused to do this they cursed him as a traitor. To-day, in spite of the\r\nfull airing this case has had in the courts and investigations, Judge\r\nHaight is still accused of selling himself to a corporation, and Mr.\r\nRogers is accused daily in Montana of having burned a refinery in\r\nBuffalo. As a matter of fact, no refinery was burned in Buffalo, nor was\r\nit ever proved that Mr. Rogers knew anything of the attempts the\r\nEverests made to destroy Matthews’s business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n                 THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY AND POLITICS\r\n\r\n  OIL MEN CHARGE STANDARD WITH INTRENCHING ITSELF IN STATE AND NATIONAL\r\n    POLITICS—ELECTION OF PAYNE TO SENATE IN OHIO IN 1884 CLAIMED TO\r\n    ESTABLISH CHARGE OF BRIBERY—FULL INVESTIGATION OF PAYNE’S ELECTION\r\n    DENIED BY UNITED STATES SENATE COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS—PAYNE HIMSELF\r\n    DOES NOT DEMAND INVESTIGATION—POPULAR FEELING AGAINST STANDARD IS\r\n    AGGRAVATED—THE BILLINGSLEY BILL IN THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE—A\r\n    FORCE BILL DIRECTED AGAINST THE STANDARD—OIL MEN FIGHT HARD FOR\r\n    IT—THE BILL IS DEFEATED—STANDARD CHARGED WITH USING MONEY AGAINST\r\n    IT—A GROWING DEMAND FOR FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STANDARD A RESULT OF\r\n    THESE SPECIFIC CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases described in the last two chapters naturally aroused intense\r\ninterest in the Oil Regions. The two in Ohio demonstrated afresh the\r\nchief grievances which the oil men had against the Standard Oil Company\r\nsince 1872—that they were securing rebates on their own shipments and\r\ndrawbacks on those of their competitors. The Buffalo case demonstrated\r\nthat when their ordinary advantages failed to get a rival out of the way\r\nthey winked at methods which a jury called criminal. It was fresh proof\r\nof what the oil men had always claimed, that the Standard Oil Company\r\nwas a conspiracy! At the same time that these cases were arousing their\r\nindignation anew there occurred in Ohio an affair which gave them new\r\nevidence of their old charge that the Standard was steadily intrenching\r\nitself in state and national politics in order to direct the course of\r\nlegislation to suit itself. There had been many evidences of this,\r\nsatisfactory enough to the initiated. There was no doubt that the\r\ninvestigation of 1876 and the first bill to regulate interstate commerce\r\nintroduced at that time had been squelched largely through the efforts\r\nof two members of Congress, one of them directly and the other\r\nindirectly interested in the Standard—these were J. N. Camden of West\r\nVirginia, head of the Camden Consolidated Oil Company, now one of the\r\nconstituent companies of the Standard Oil Trust, and H. B. Payne of\r\nOhio, the father of the treasurer of the Standard, Oliver H. Payne. It\r\nhad certainly used its influence to oppose the free pipe-line bill which\r\nthe independent oil men had been fighting for since the early days of\r\nthe industry. In 1878 and 1879, during the prosecution of the suits\r\nagainst the railroads and the Standard by the Petroleum Producers’\r\nUnion, there had been incessant charge of the use of political influence\r\nto secure delay. It was a matter of constant comment in Ohio, New York\r\nand Pennsylvania that the Standard was active in all elections, and that\r\nit “stood in” with every ambitious young politician, that rarely did an\r\nable young lawyer get into office who was not retained by the Standard.\r\nThe company seems to have taken a hand in politics even before the days\r\nof the South Improvement Company, for Mr. Payne once said in the United\r\nStates Senate that when he was a candidate for the House of\r\nRepresentatives in 1871, “no association, no combination” in his\r\ndistrict did more to bring about his defeat or spent so much money to\r\naccomplish it as the Standard Oil Company![114]\r\n\r\nBut all of the examples they quoted were more or less poor in evidence.\r\nOf no one of them perhaps could they have produced satisfactory proof.\r\nNow, however, simultaneously with the three cases outlined in the last\r\ntwo chapters there came a case of bribery in an election which they held\r\nestablished their charge. The case was the familiar one of the election\r\nof H. B. Payne of Ohio to the United States Senate in January, 1884. Mr.\r\nPayne was at the time of his election the aristocrat _par excellence_ of\r\nCleveland, Ohio. He had birth and education, distinction of manner and\r\nmind. His fine old mansion still remains one of the most distinguished\r\nhouses in a city of beautiful homes. He had been active in Democratic\r\npolitics for many years—a member of the state Senate and a member of\r\nCongress, and he had been mentioned as the Democratic candidate for the\r\npresidency in 1880, receiving eighty-one votes on the first ballot. At\r\nthe time of his election to the Senate he was a man seventy-four years\r\nold. Now Mr. Payne’s son, Oliver H. Payne, was one of the thirteen\r\noriginal members of the South Improvement Company, and one of the rare\r\nCleveland refiners who had a strong enough stomach to go into the\r\nStandard Oil Company when it swept up the oil trade of Cleveland in\r\n1872, and he had gathered in his share of the spoils of that raid.\r\nOliver Payne was proud of his father, and it was well known that he\r\nwanted to see him in the Senate of the United States, but there had been\r\nno movement to nominate him, and in 1883 he seems to have made up his\r\nmind to see what he could do.\r\n\r\nA United States Senator was to be elected in Ohio in November. In\r\nOctober a new State Legislature was chosen, and the Democratic members\r\nwere instructed for one of two candidates for the Senate, George H.\r\nPendleton or General Durbin Ward, both men of prominence and long\r\nservice in the public life of the state. Mr. Payne’s name was not\r\nmentioned in the canvass. Nevertheless, hardly had the Legislature\r\nconvened when there sprang up at the Neil House in Columbus an\r\nextraordinary Payne boom. Its backers were Senator Payne’s own son,\r\nOliver H. Payne, at that time treasurer of the Standard Oil Company, and\r\nColonel Thompson, a prominent personage in the same concern. Their\r\nlieutenants were also members of the company in one capacity or another.\r\nLarge sums of money were alleged to have been circulated. There was a\r\nrumour that Oliver Payne said the election cost him $100,000. It was\r\nclaimed that it could be proved that a check for $65,000 had been cashed\r\nin Cleveland by one of the men most prominent in the Payne boom, and\r\nthat the whole sum had been spent in Columbus.\r\n\r\nA perfect uproar of indignation followed the announcement of Mr. Payne’s\r\nchoice. All over the state the Standard Oil Company was charged with the\r\nelection. The Democratic press was particularly bitter:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Said the Butler County Democrat: “It was simply a question whether\r\n  Pendleton, Ward, Thurman, Converse, Follett, Geddes, or any other\r\n  capable and honest Democrat, should receive the compliments of a\r\n  seat in the Senate, or that the Standard Oil Company should buy the\r\n  place for Henry B. Payne. It was an honest and divided Democracy\r\n  against a hydra-headed dictatorship of rich men on whose banner was\r\n  inscribed ‘Money Talks.’”\r\n\r\n  The Carroll County Chronicle in commenting on the election said: “It\r\n  is a great mistake to suppose Standard Oil has captured the\r\n  Democratic party of Ohio. It may have captured a score or two of men\r\n  elected to the Legislature, but they are not the Democracy of Ohio\r\n  by a long shot. When the British got General Benedict Arnold they\r\n  imagined they had captured the United States army, but it was a\r\n  mistake.”\r\n\r\n  “The monopoly of the Standard Oil Company must be destroyed,”\r\n  declared the Columbus Times. “Its intrusion into political circles\r\n  must be prevented. There must be no later acceptance of this\r\n  outrage. Political purity and perpetuity permit no complacency.\r\n  These pernicious foreign elements must be eradicated, and until they\r\n  are no Democrat will enter the capitol of Ohio or of the nation. The\r\n  rottenness that uncovered itself last night has not its confines in\r\n  Ohio.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe comments were not confined to papers of the state. The New York Sun,\r\nunder the head “Was Payne’s Election Bought?” said:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The subjoined communication from a source which we always respect\r\n  is worthy of more attention than is usually bestowed upon the\r\n  animated expressions of those whose preferences have not been\r\n  realised:\r\n\r\n  “‘It is now believed, and I believe, that the Standard Oil Company\r\n  recently bought with money Ohio’s seat in the Senate of the United\r\n  States for Mr. Payne. Now, can the social respectability of a man\r\n  make such a crime respectable? Or is there to be one standard of\r\n  political morality for Republicans and another for Democrats? Or are\r\n  Democrats expected to condemn corruption only when practised by\r\n  Republicans, and to condone, defend, and cover it up when practised\r\n  by Democrats, or when it is found only in the Democratic party? In\r\n  my opinion there is no danger so threatening to free institutions as\r\n  the sale and purchase of political power, and nothing more to be\r\n  condemned.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough these charges were kept up for two years neither the Standard\r\nOil Company, Mr. Payne, nor the Legislature which had elected him\r\nnoticed them. The scandal became one of the issues of the next campaign\r\nand was instrumental in making the next Legislature of Ohio Republican.\r\nAs soon as the new Legislature convened at the opening of 1886 an\r\ninvestigation of the Payne case was ordered. Some fifty-five witnesses\r\nwere examined, and the resulting testimony turned over to the Senate of\r\nthe United States for its examination. The testimony did not prove the\r\ncharge of bribery, the Ohio Legislature said, but it was of such a\r\nnature as to require the Senate’s attention. The matter went to the\r\nSenate Committee on Elections, and in July, 1886, a majority reported\r\nagainst the further investigation asked by the state of Ohio.[115]\r\nAgainst this decision two members of the committee, Senators Hoar and\r\nFrye, protested:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Is the Senate to deny to the people of a great state, speaking\r\n  through their Legislature and their representative citizens, the\r\n  only opportunity for a hearing of this momentous case which can\r\n  exist under the constitution? We have not prejudged the case, nor do\r\n  we mean to prejudge it. We sincerely trust that the investigation,\r\n  which is as much demanded for the honour of the sitting members as\r\n  for that of the Senate or the state of Ohio, may result in\r\n  vindicating his title to his seat and the good name of the\r\n  Legislature that elected him.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  “How can a question of bribery ever be raised or ever be\r\n  investigated if the arguments against this investigation prevail?\r\n  You do not suppose that the men who bribe or the men who are bribed\r\n  will volunteer to furnish evidence against themselves? You do not\r\n  expect that impartial and unimpeachable witnesses will be present at\r\n  the transaction? Ordinarily, of course, if a claim like this be\r\n  brought to the attention of the Senate from a respectable quarter\r\n  that a title to a seat here was obtained by corrupt means, the\r\n  Senator concerned will hasten to demand an investigation. But that\r\n  is wholly within his own discretion and does not affect the due mode\r\n  of procedure by the Senate. From the nature of the case, the process\r\n  of the Senate must compel the persons who conducted the canvass and\r\n  the persons who made the election to appear and disclose what they\r\n  know; and until that process issue, you must act upon such\r\n  information only as is enough to cause inquiry in the ordinary\r\n  affairs of life.\r\n\r\n  “The question now is not whether the case is proved; it is only\r\n  whether it shall be inquired into. That has never yet been done. It\r\n  cannot be done until the Senate issues its process. No unwilling\r\n  witness has ever yet been compelled to testify; no process has gone\r\n  out which could cross state lines. The Senate is now to determine,\r\n  as the law of the present case and as the precedent for all future\r\n  cases, as to the great crime of bribery—a crime which poisons the\r\n  waters of republican liberty in the fountain—that the circumstances\r\n  which here appear are not enough to demand its attention.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three oppressive July days the Senate gave almost all of its time to\r\na bitter debate on the report. The name of the Standard was freely used.\r\n“The Senate of the United States,” said Senator Frye, “when the question\r\ncomes before it as this has been presented, whether or not the great\r\nStandard Oil Company, the greatest monopoly to-day in the United States\r\nof America, a power which makes itself felt in every inch of territory\r\nin this whole republic, a power which controls business, railroads, men\r\nand things, shall also control here; whether that great body has put its\r\nhands upon a legislative body and undertaken to control, has controlled,\r\nand has elected a member of the United States Senate, that Senate, I\r\nsay, cannot afford to sit silent and let not its voice be heard in an\r\ninquiry as to the truth of the allegation.” The majority report was\r\nadopted, however, by a vote of forty-four to seventeen. “The most\r\nunfortunate fact in the history of the Senate,” said Senator Hoar.[116]\r\n\r\nFor the time the matter rested, but only for the time. The failure to\r\ninvestigate rather intensified the convictions that Payne’s seat was\r\nbought by the Standard Oil Company. In 1887 Mr. Payne voted against the\r\nInterstate Commerce Bill. “That is why he was put in the Senate,” people\r\nsaid bitterly. The feeling became still more intense in 1888. The\r\nquestion of trusts was before Congress. The Republicans had come out\r\nwith an anti-trust plank in their platform; the Democrats, in response\r\nto Mr. Cleveland’s message, were declaring the tariff the greatest\r\ntrust-builder in existence, and calling on their opponents for reform\r\nthere if they were sincere in their anti-trust attitude. In this\r\nagitation the Standard Oil Company undoubtedly exerted its influence\r\nagainst all trust investigation and legislation. The charge became\r\ngeneral that they were helping the Democrats. This is why they wanted a\r\nDemocratic Senate. In September, 1888, when a phase of the question was\r\nbefore the Senate, Mr. Hoar, with his genius for asking far-reaching\r\nquestions, said one day: “Is there a Standard Oil Trust in this country\r\nor not?... If there be such a trust, is it represented in the Cabinet at\r\nthis moment? Is it represented in the Senate? Is it represented in the\r\ncouncils of any important political party in the country?”\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that Mr. Payne had been sufficiently aroused to\r\nreply. “There is nothing whatever to sustain the insinuation which the\r\nhonourable Senator conveys. I make the declaration now for the first\r\ntime, and it will be the last time I shall ever take notice of it. The\r\nStandard Oil Company is a very remarkable and wonderful institution. It\r\nhas accomplished within the last twenty years of commercial enterprise\r\nwhat no other company or association of modern times has accomplished,\r\nbut, Mr. President, I never had a dollar’s interest in that company. I\r\nnever owned a dollar of its stock; I never rendered it any service, and\r\nthat company never rendered me any service. On the contrary, when a\r\ncandidate for the other House in 1871, no institution, no association,\r\nno combination in my district did more to bring about my defeat and went\r\nto so large an expense in money to accomplish it as the Standard Oil\r\nCompany....\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, nine-tenths of the stockholders of the Standard\r\nOil Company are now and always have been Republicans. Within my\r\nknowledge there are but two Democrats who have ever been stockholders in\r\nthat company.” Farther on Mr. Payne interpolated this irrelevant remark:\r\n“Not only are the majority Republicans, but they are very liberal in\r\ntheir philanthropic contributions to charities and benevolent works, and\r\nI venture the assertion that two gentlemen in that company have donated\r\nmore money for philanthropic and for benevolent purposes than all the\r\nRepublican members of the Senate put together.”\r\n\r\nMr. Payne’s denial was not sufficient to silence Senator Hoar. He\r\nreturned to the attack. It was a “general public belief,” he declared,\r\nthat the Standard Oil Company was represented in the Cabinet and Senate.\r\nHe called attention to the newspapers’ charge to that effect, and\r\ndeclared that he had received many personal letters charging that the\r\nStandard was helping the Democrats. He asked for information when he\r\nasked his question; he made no charges. Mr. Whitney was the member of\r\nMr. Cleveland’s Cabinet to whom Senator Hoar referred, and he promptly,\r\nin a public letter, disclaimed all connection with the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. Mr. Hoar said he “cheerfully accepted” the denial. As for Mr.\r\nPayne, he was not satisfied, and when Mr. Payne in heat replied to him,\r\nSenator Hoar closed his lips forever in a burst of biting sarcasm:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “A Senator who, when the Governor of his state, when both branches\r\n  of the Legislature of his state complained to us that a seat in the\r\n  United States Senate had been bought, when the other Senator from\r\n  the state rose and told us that that was the belief of a very large\r\n  majority of the people of Ohio without distinction of party, failed\r\n  to rise in his place and ask for the investigation which would have\r\n  put an end to those charges if they had been unfounded, sheltering\r\n  himself behind the technicalities which were found by some gentlemen\r\n  on both sides of this chamber, that the investigation ought not to\r\n  be made, but who could have had it by the slightest request on his\r\n  own part and then remained dumb, I think should forever after hold\r\n  his peace.... I think few men ever sat in the Senate who would\r\n  refrain from demanding an investigation under such circumstances,\r\n  even if it were not required by the Senate itself.... There were\r\n  Senators who thought that the admission of that Senator, the\r\n  continuance of that Senator in his seat without investigation,\r\n  indicated the low-water mark of the Senate of the United States\r\n  itself.”[117]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there the Payne case rested. It was never _proved_ that the Standard\r\nOil Company had contributed a cent to his election. It was never\r\n_proved_ that his seat was bought, but the fact that, in the face of\r\nsuch serious charges, rehearsed constantly for four years, neither Mr.\r\nPayne nor the Standard Oil Company had done aught but keep quiet,\r\nconvinced a large part of the country that the suspicion under which\r\nthey rested was less damaging than the truth would be. In the minds of\r\ngreat numbers this silence was a confession of guilt. The Payne case\r\ncertainly aggravated greatly the popular feeling that the Standard Oil\r\nCompany was using the legislative bodies of the country in its own\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThis feeling was intensified in 1887 by a terrific battle between the\r\noil producers and Standard forces in the Legislature of the state of\r\nPennsylvania. Since the compromise of 1880 the body of the oil producers\r\nhad been taking no concerted action against the Standard. But their\r\ninaction was not due to reconciliation to Standard domination. As a\r\nmatter of fact they were almost as bitter in 1886 as they had been in\r\n1878, when they formed the Union which for two years fought so good a\r\nfight. The specific complaint of the oil producers at this time was that\r\nthey were being “robbed” by the National Transit Company—the big\r\nStandard pipe-line consolidation, which had secured by the series of\r\nmanœuvres already outlined the monopoly of handling and transporting\r\ncrude oil. If the oil producers had been making money at this time it is\r\nquite possible that they would have paid little attention to the profits\r\nof the National Transit Company. The service they got was about as\r\nperfect as any human machine could render, and they would probably have\r\nrecognised this and been willing to pay high if they too had been\r\nprosperous. But the condition of the oil producer in these days was in\r\nglaring contrast to that of Mr. Rockefeller. They had piled up oil until\r\nthere were in 1886 over 33,000,000 barrels on hand. Naturally this had\r\ndriven prices down. The average price for the last years had been under\r\na dollar a barrel. In 1886 it fell down to 71⅜, and everyone said it\r\nmust go lower. Embittered and discouraged, the producers fell to\r\ncomparing what they were getting out of the business with what Mr.\r\nRockefeller was getting. It was not a consoling showing. The Standard\r\nOil Trust had from its organisation in 1882 paid dividends on its\r\n$70,000,000 capital. In spite of the extraordinary outlay for tank\r\nbuilding and seaboard pipe-lines made from 1881 to 1884—$30,000,000 it\r\nis computed to have been—the trust paid 10½ per cent. in 1885, ten per\r\ncent. in 1886, and Standard Oil stock stood near 200! In contrast, the\r\noil producer, in 1886, is estimated to have lost about six per cent. on\r\nhis expenditures, and oil property depreciated one-third in value.[118]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\r\n\r\n  By Eastman Johnson\r\n]\r\n\r\nSomething was wrong. They could not charge the Standard with the price\r\nof oil. As long as over 33,000,000 barrels in stock lay on the market it\r\ncould not rise. But they could and did complain of what it cost them to\r\nhandle this oil, of storage and carrying charges, of the deductions for\r\nshrinkage and for loss by fire. If the Standard had not forced out every\r\ncompeting line, there would have been sufficient competition to have\r\nlowered these items—which at the present prices soon ate up the value of\r\noil. And they fell to rehearsing the raids by which the various\r\ntransporting companies which had fought themselves into independent\r\npositions had been forced into combination, their chief grievances being\r\nnaturally the affair of the Tidewater. In this state of mind, and\r\nincited by the Buffalo, the Payne, and the Rice cases, it was natural\r\nenough that when suddenly, at the opening of 1887, a bill evidently\r\nintended to strike a blow at the Standard was introduced into the\r\nLegislature of Pennsylvania, the oil producers rushed pell-mell to\r\nsupport it. The opening sentence was enough for them. It was “An act to\r\n_punish_ corporations.”[119] This was what they had always sought, some\r\nway to _punish_ Mr. Rockefeller for what they believed to be a\r\nconspiracy against their interests. The way in which the Billingsley\r\nBill, as it was called from the name of its father, proposed to punish\r\nthe Standard was to make it a criminal offence to charge in excess of\r\ncertain rates it fixed—ten cents a barrel for gathering and delivering\r\noil to storing points (the current rate was twenty cents); one-sixtieth\r\nof one per cent. per barrel a day for storage, with no storage charge\r\nfor the first thirty days (one-half of one per cent. was the current\r\nrate); one-half of one per cent. shrinkage, instead of three per cent.\r\nBesides, the bill required the Standard to go to any well on application\r\nof the owner, it made the company liable for damage, and it required it\r\nto deliver oil of like kind and quality as that received.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm with which the bill was greeted was cooled a little by\r\nthe announcement that as it stood it was unconstitutional—acts to punish\r\nbeing forbidden by the constitution of the state—as well as by an\r\nimmediate realisation that the prices fixed for services were in nearly\r\nevery case less than cost. The bill was immediately amended. When it\r\ncame back it was at once apparent that, in spite of this preliminary\r\nhitch, a tremendous fight to carry it was being organised by the oil\r\nmen. Then determination to push it grew in proportion to the Standard\r\nopposition. The Standard, indeed, realised immediately that unless a\r\nhard fight was made the bill would go through by popular clamour, and\r\nthey turned their big lawyer, Mr. Dodd, against it, set their\r\nnewspapers—the Oil City Derrick, Titusville Herald and Bradford Era, all\r\nof them by this time subsidised organs—to argue against it, and sent Mr.\r\nScheide, one of the ablest of their pipe-line managers, to present their\r\nside at Harrisburg. They also secured the services of a well-known young\r\nRepublican member of the Legislature, Wallace Delemater, of Crawford\r\nCounty, one of the counties in the Oil Regions, to organise an\r\nopposition to the bill in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn February a hearing was given the bill, Mr. Dodd presenting the\r\nStandard side. It is rare that so able a lawyer has to fight so weak a\r\nmeasure, and Mr. Dodd riddled it easily. As a matter of fact the\r\nBillingsley Bill was as bad as it could be. It was characterised by all\r\nsorts of constitutional, legal and practical difficulties. The pipe-line\r\nbusiness was an interstate business, and this bill attempted to regulate\r\nit—which evidently it could not do. It could, of course, regulate\r\nPennsylvania oil, but, by so doing, it created two classes of oil in the\r\nlines, a situation which would have been confusing and undesirable. It\r\nwas evidently intended that the prices it fixed should apply to the\r\n30,000,000 barrels of stocks on hand, but these were held under\r\ncontract, and could not be touched. There were many other objections to\r\nthe bill. Even Judge Heydrick, the able lawyer whom the oil men had\r\nengaged to defend it, was obliged to apologise for it at every point,\r\nand its most valiant supporter, Senator Lewis Emery, Jr., said frankly\r\nthat the framer of the bill knew too little of the oil men’s needs to be\r\nable to make a bill, and that this would have to be thoroughly revised.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the reasonable, indeed overwhelming, objections to the\r\nBillingsley Bill, the oil men clung to it. Mass-meetings were held\r\nnightly from one end of the region to the other, petitions flooded the\r\nLegislature, a big delegation was kept constantly in Harrisburg lobbying\r\nfor it. The support was intemperate, bitter, unreasonable. In March it\r\nwas intensified by the knowledge that a self-constituted committee of\r\nleading oil men were in New York treating with the Standard in regard to\r\ncertain of the abuses the bill aimed to cure. These men felt that the\r\nStandard was unjust in its dealings with the oil men, excessive in its\r\ncharges, and arbitrary in its service, but they felt that the confusion\r\nthe Billingsley Bill would bring into the business more than offset the\r\ngrievances it righted, and they had gone to Mr. Rockefeller to see if\r\nmatters could not be compromised. Now nothing could have more\r\neffectually added to the warlike spirit abroad in the Oil Regions at\r\nthat moment than the suggestion of a compromise. Their cause was being\r\n“sold.” It was “compounding with felony,” and when, after a three days’\r\nsitting in New York, the committee came home with an agreement from the\r\nNational Transit Company, making certain concessions—as two per cent.\r\ninstead of three for shrinkage, twenty-five cents a day per 1,000\r\nbarrels, instead of forty, for storage, and with a promise that certain\r\nother points should be settled by joint committees—two of the leading\r\nmembers were hung in effigy in Titusville!\r\n\r\nIn April the final vote on the Billingsley Bill came. Harrisburg was\r\nalive with oil men determined that the bill should go through. The\r\nStandard was present, and if it had less of a _claque_, it had more of\r\nthe “sinews of war.” Indeed, it was charged later by Senator Lewis Emery\r\nthat the leader of the Standard forces in the Senate received $65,000\r\nfor his services—a charge which, so far as the writer knows, has never\r\nbeen either proved or disproved. The bill came to a vote after a\r\npassionate wrangle. It was defeated eighteen to twenty-five. A storm of\r\nviolent protest from the oil men’s representatives followed the defeat,\r\nand the lobbies, the hotels, and even the streets of Harrisburg were\r\nscenes in the next hours of bitter quarrels and excited gatherings. When\r\nfinally the oil men withdrew from the town it was with the understanding\r\nthat they were to meet two weeks later in Oil City to organise a new\r\nprotective association. The protests and resolutions passed at their\r\nfinal gatherings foreshadowed no intention of reviving the Billingsley\r\nBill. Indeed, the bill itself had received scant attention from them in\r\nthe violent campaign over its passage which they had carried on for\r\nthree months. All their passion had been expended on the Standard. This\r\nwas a question of whether the Standard Oil Company ruled the Legislature\r\nof Pennsylvania or whether the people ruled it—so declared the oil men;\r\nand when their bill was defeated they charged it was by bribery, and\r\nhenceforth quoted the defeat of the Billingsley Bill along with the\r\nPayne case as proof of the corrupt power of the Standard Oil Company in\r\npolitics. Their outbreak, for it was nothing else, was the culmination\r\nof their indignation and resentment at fifteen years of unfair play on\r\nthe part of the Standard Oil Company, of resentment at the South\r\nImprovement Company, at forced combination of refineries and pipe-lines,\r\nat railroad rebates and drawbacks, at the immediate shipment outrages,\r\nat the Tidewater defeat. It was revolt against the incessant pressure of\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s pitiless steel grip. It was bitterness at the idea\r\nthat it was he who was reaping all the profit of a business in which\r\nthey were taking the chief risks, and if things went on as they were\r\nthat it was he who always would. Out of their burst of passion was to\r\ngrow a solid determined effort, but for the moment they were defeated,\r\nand the defeat, which really was merited, was another added to their\r\nseries of just and unjust complaints against Mr. Rockefeller.\r\n\r\nAll of these bitter and spectacular struggles aroused intense public\r\ninterest. The debate on the Interstate Commerce Bill was contemporaneous\r\nwith them—the bill was passed in 1887, and had its effect. The feeling\r\ngrew all over the country that whatever the merits of these specific\r\ncases, there was danger in the mysterious organisation by which such\r\nimmense fortunes and such excessive power could be built up on one side\r\nof an industry, while another side steadily lost money and power. A new\r\ntrial was coming to Mr. Rockefeller, one much more serious than any\r\ntrial for overt acts, for the very nature of his great creation was to\r\nbe in question. It was a hard trial, for all John D. Rockefeller asked\r\nof the world by the year 1887 was to be let alone. He had completed one\r\nof the most perfect business organisations the world has ever seen, an\r\norganisation which handled practically all of a great natural product.\r\nHis factories were the most perfect and were managed with the strictest\r\neconomy. He owned outright the pipe-lines which transported the crude\r\noil. His knowledge of the consuming power of the world was accurate, and\r\nhe kept his output strictly within its limit. At the same time the great\r\nmarketing machinery he had put in operation carried on an aggressive\r\ncampaign for new markets. In China, Africa, South America, as well as in\r\nremote parts of Europe and the United States, Standard agents carried\r\nrefined oil. The Standard Oil Company had been organised to do business,\r\nand if ever a company did business it was this one. From Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhimself, sitting all day in his den, hidden from everybody but the\r\nremarkable body of directors and heads of departments which he had\r\n“acquired” as he wiped up one refinery and one pipe-line after another,\r\nto the humblest clerk in the office of the most remote marketing agency,\r\neverybody worked. There was not a lazy bone in the organisation, nor an\r\nincompetent hand, nor a stupid head. It was a machine where everybody\r\nwas kept on his mettle by an extraordinary system of competition, where\r\nsuccess met immediate recognition, where opportunity was wide as the\r\nworld’s craving for a good light to cheer its hours of darkness. The\r\nmachine was pervaded and stimulated by the consciousness of its own\r\npower and prosperity. It was a great thing to belong to an organisation\r\nwhich always got what it wanted, and which was making money as no\r\nbusiness in the country had ever made it.\r\n\r\nWhat more, indeed, could Mr. Rockefeller ask than to be let alone? And\r\nwhy not let him alone? He had the ability to keep together the\r\nwide-spread interests he had acquired—not only to keep them together,\r\nbut to unify and develop them; why not let him alone? Many people even\r\nin the Oil Regions were inclined to do so, some because they feared\r\nhim—rumour said Mr. Rockefeller was vindictive and never forgot\r\nopposition; others because they were canny and foresaw that they might\r\nwant his help one day; still others because criticism of success is an\r\nungracious business and arouses a suspicion that the critic may be\r\nenvious or bitter. But there were a few people, as there always are,\r\nwhom no cowardice, no self-interest, no fear of public opinion could\r\nkeep quiet, and these people insistently urged that the Standard Oil\r\nCompany was a menace to the commerce of the country. We have been and\r\nare being wronged, they repeated. We have a right to do an independent\r\nbusiness. Interference to drive us out is conspiracy. Let Mr.\r\nRockefeller succeed in the oil business and he will attack other\r\nindustries; he will have imitators. In fifty years a handful of men will\r\nown the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller handled his critics with a skill bordering on genius. He\r\nignored them. To see them, to answer them, called attention to them. He\r\nwas too busy to answer them. “We do not talk much—we saw wood.” This\r\nattitude of serene indifference is supremely wise. It belittles the\r\ncritic and it gives the outsider who watches the game a feeling that a\r\nserenity so high must come from an impregnable position. There is no\r\nquestion but many a mouth opened to testify against the Standard Oil\r\nCompany has been closed by Mr. Rockefeller’s policy of silence. Only the\r\nfew irreconcilables withstood his sphinx-like attitude, and yearly, from\r\nthe compromising of 1880, these warnings and accusations were louder and\r\nmore fierce. Probably the greatest trial Mr. Rockefeller has ever had\r\nhas come from the persistency with which the few malcontents kept him\r\nbefore the public. They interfered with two of his great\r\nprinciples—“hide the profits” and “say nothing.” It was they who had\r\nruined the South Improvement Company; it was they who had indicted him\r\nfor conspiracy and compelled him to compromise in 1880. It was they who\r\nnow, after the splendid pipe-line organisation was completed and his\r\nmarket machinery was in order, kept up their agitation and their\r\ncursing. Their work began to tell. The feeling grew that the Standard\r\nOil Company, or Trust, as it was by this time generally called, must be\r\nlooked into. Even those who, dazzled by Mr. Rockefeller’s achievement,\r\nwere inclined to overlook its ethical side and to refuse to consider to\r\nwhat aggregation of power and abuse it might lead, began to feel that it\r\nwould be quite as well to have the matter thrashed out, to have it\r\nsettled once for all, whether the thing had been so bad in its making\r\nand was so dangerous in its tendencies as the “oil-shriekers” pretended.\r\nIn the House of Representatives, when the question of ordering an\r\ninvestigation of trusts by the Committee on Manufactures was up in 1887,\r\nthe liveliest concern was shown as to whether the Standard Oil Company,\r\n“the most important case” of all, would escape. More than one member\r\nasked to be assured before consenting to the investigation that the\r\nStandard would be put on the rack. The same interest was shown in the\r\nSenate of New York State, where an investigation was ordered for\r\nFebruary, 1888. It was certain indeed now that Mr. Rockefeller would not\r\nbe allowed much longer to work in the dark. He was to be dragged into\r\nthe open, much as he might deplore it, to explain what his trust really\r\nwas, to prove to a suspicious and hostile public that he had a right to\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n                      THE BREAKING UP OF THE TRUST\r\n\r\n  EPIDEMIC OF TRUST INVESTIGATION IN 1888—STANDARD INVESTIGATED BY NEW\r\n    YORK STATE SENATE—ROCKEFELLER’S REMARKABLE TESTIMONY—INQUIRY INTO\r\n    THE NATURE OF THE MYSTERIOUS STANDARD OIL TRUST—ORIGINAL STANDARD\r\n    OIL TRUST AGREEMENT REVEALED—INVESTIGATION OF THE STANDARD BY\r\n    CONGRESS IN 1888—AS A RESULT OF THE UNCOVERING OF THE STANDARD OIL\r\n    TRUST AGREEMENT ATTORNEY-GENERAL WATSON OF OHIO BEGINS AN ACTION IN\r\n    QUO WARRANTO AGAINST THE TRUST—MARCUS A. HANNA AND OTHERS TRY TO\r\n    PERSUADE WATSON NOT TO PRESS THE SUIT—WATSON PERSISTS—COURT FINALLY\r\n    DECIDES AGAINST STANDARD AND TRUST IS FORCED TO MAKE AN APPARENT\r\n    DISSOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no characteristic of Mr. Rockefeller and his great corporation\r\nwhich from the beginning had been more exasperating to the oil world\r\nthan the secrecy with which operations were conducted. The plan of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company had only been revealed to those who signed an\r\nagreement to keep secret all transactions they might have with it. The\r\npurchase in 1874 and 1875 by the Standard Oil Company of Lockhart, Frew\r\nand Company of Pittsburg, of Warden, Frew and Company of Philadelphia,\r\nand of Charles Pratt and Company of New York was so thoroughly concealed\r\nthat Mr. Rockefeller, five years after it occurred, dared make an\r\naffidavit that it had never occurred![120] Men who entered into running\r\narrangements with Mr. Rockefeller were cautioned “not to tell their\r\nwives,” and correspondence between them and the Standard Oil Company was\r\ncarried on under assumed names! Whenever the subject of the relations\r\nbetween the various companies came up in a lawsuit or an investigation,\r\na candid and straightforward answer was always avoided by both Mr.\r\nRockefeller and the men known to be associated with him in some way. For\r\ninstance, in 1879, when H. H. Rogers was before the Hepburn Committee,\r\nan effort was made to find out what relation the firm of Charles Pratt\r\nand Company, of which he was a member, sustained to the Standard Oil\r\nCompany. Mr. Rogers’s testimony was a masterpiece of good-natured\r\nevasion,[121] and all that the examiners could get, though they returned\r\nagain and again to the inquiry, was that Charles Pratt and Company\r\nworked in “harmony” with the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\nWhen ex-Governor Nash of Ohio was investigating the relations of the\r\nCleveland and Marietta Railroad and the National Transit Company, try\r\nhis best he could not find out anything definite. In his report Mr. Nash\r\nsaid: “I have purposely referred to the parties who entered into this\r\narrangement with Receiver Pease and his freight agent, J. E. Terry, as\r\nthe parties represented by O’Day and Scheide, for the reason that I have\r\nnot been able to ascertain who or what the parties are.” That they were\r\nofficers of the National Transit Company he had evidence, but what\r\nrelation had the National Transit Company to the Standard Oil Company?\r\nWas it a part of it? Mr. Nash was unable to find from Mr. O’Day, closely\r\nas he might question him.[122]\r\n\r\nIn the Buffalo case, when John D. Rockefeller was on the stand, he was\r\nput through a questioning in regard to the relations of the persons\r\nconcerned in the suit to the Standard Oil Trust, whose existence he\r\nadmitted. Mr. Rockefeller answered all the questions his lawyers would\r\nallow, but at the end the plaintiffs had gained little or nothing, and\r\nthere was a strong impression, from the attitude of his lawyers rather\r\nthan from that of Mr. Rockefeller, that an effort was making to conceal\r\nthe nature of the agreement or charter or whatever it was under which\r\nthe companies involved were working. Naturally enough this attitude\r\ninspired resentment and aggravated the feeling that this secrecy meant\r\nevil-doing. When the epidemic of trust investigation broke out in 1888,\r\nand the Standard Oil Trust was brought up for examination, there was a\r\ngeneral public demand to have the matter cleared up. The first\r\ninvestigation of importance took place in February, 1888, in New York\r\nCity, and by the direction of the Senate of New York State. A list of\r\nmore than a score of trusts was in the hands of the committee, and, with\r\nthe limited time at their disposal, it was certain that they could not\r\nlook into more than half a dozen. There seems to have been no hesitation\r\nabout including the Standard Oil Trust. “This is the original trust,”\r\nwrote the committee. “Its success has been the incentive to the\r\nformation of all other trusts or combinations. It is the type of a\r\nsystem which has spread like a disease through the commercial system of\r\nthis country.”\r\n\r\nThere were several things the committee wanted to know about the\r\nStandard Oil Trust, and its president was summoned for examination. (1)\r\nWhat was it? Was it an organisation recognised by any law of the land?\r\nLong ago men had decided that partnerships, corporations, companies, in\r\nwhich men united to do business, must be regulated by law and subjected\r\nto a certain amount of publicity, if the public good was to be\r\nprotected. Was the Standard Oil Trust within or without the law? (2) By\r\nthe testimony of its own members, in other years the Standard\r\nCombination controlled from eighty to ninety per cent. of the oil\r\nbusiness of the country. Was this supremacy due in any measure to\r\nspecial privileges, such as discrimination in railroad rates? (3) Was\r\nits power used to manipulate production and prices, and to prevent men\r\noutside entering the oil business?\r\n\r\nIt was to learn these things that the commission summoned Mr.\r\nRockefeller. Flanked by Joseph H. Choate, present Ambassador to the\r\nCourt of King Edward and the most eminent lawyer of the day, and S. C.\r\nT. Dodd, a no less able if a less well-known lawyer, Mr. Rockefeller\r\nsubmitted himself to his questioners. In no case where he has appeared\r\non the stand can his skill as a witness be studied to better advantage.\r\nWith a wealth of polite phrases—“You are very good,” “I beg with all\r\nrespect”—Mr. Rockefeller bowed himself to the will of the committee.\r\nWith an air of eager frankness he told them nothing he did not wish them\r\nto know. The committee had a desire to begin at the beginning. It\r\nevidently had heard that a short-lived organisation, called the South\r\nImprovement Company, had given Mr. Rockefeller his whip-hand in the oil\r\nbusiness as far back as 1872, enabling him in three months’ time to\r\nraise his daily capacity as a refiner from 1,500 to 10,000 barrels, and\r\nso they asked Mr. Rockefeller:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ There was such a company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have heard of such a company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Were you not in it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I was not.[123]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a perfectly well-known fact that Mr. Rockefeller owned 180 shares\r\nin the South Improvement Company, of which he was a director; that, when\r\na public uprising caused the destruction of the company, he was one of\r\nthe two men who tried to save it; also that the Standard Oil Company of\r\nOhio was the only concern which profited by the short-lived conspiracy.\r\n\r\nAnother staggering bit of testimony concerned railroad rates. Asked if\r\nthere had been any arrangements by which the trust or the companies\r\ncontrolled by it got transportation at any cheaper rates than was\r\nallowed to the general public, Mr. Rockefeller answered: “No, sir.” As a\r\nmatter of fact, the three great oil-carrying systems of the country—the\r\nCentral, Erie and Pennsylvania—had all of them, for much of the period\r\nbetween 1872 and 1888, granted to Mr. Rockefeller rebates calculated to\r\nkeep freight rates down for the Standard Oil Company and up for its\r\ncompetitors. Contracts and agreements to this effect are easily\r\naccessible to any one caring to investigate the quality of Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s “no.” “No,” said Mr. Rockefeller, “we have had no better\r\nrates than our neighbours,” and then, with that lack of the sense of\r\nhumour which, ethical qualities aside, is his chief limitation, he\r\nhastened to add: “But, if I may be allowed, we have found repeated\r\ninstances where other parties had secured lower rates than we had.”\r\n\r\nLater in the day the committee, which seems to have known something of\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s former contracts with the railroads, returned to the\r\nsubject, and the following colloquy, worthy of the study of all\r\nwitnesses interested in how not to tell what you know, took place:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Has not some company or companies embraced within this trust\r\n  enjoyed from railroads more favourable freight rates than those\r\n  rates accorded to refineries not in the trust?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I do not recall anything of that kind.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You have heard of such things?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have heard much in the papers about it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was there not such an allegation as that in the litigation or\r\n  controversy recently disposed of by the Interstate Commerce\r\n  Commission, Mr. Rice’s suit; was not there a charge in Mr. Rice’s\r\n  petition that companies embraced within your trust enjoyed from\r\n  railroad companies more favourable freight rates?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think Mr. Rice made such a claim; yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did not the commission find that claim true?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think the return of the commission is a matter of record; I\r\n  could not give it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You don’t know it; you haven’t seen that they did so find?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It is a matter of record.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Haven’t you read that the Interstate Commerce Commission did\r\n  find that charge to be true?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; I don’t think I could say that. I read that they made\r\n  a decision, but I am really unable to say what that decision was.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You did not feel interested enough in the litigation to see\r\n  what the decision was?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I felt an interest in the litigation; I don’t mean to say that\r\n  I did not feel an interest in it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you mean to say that you don’t know what the decision was?\r\n  that you did not read to see what the decision was?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I don’t say that; I know that the Interstate Commerce\r\n  Commission had made a decision; the decision is quite a\r\n  comprehensive one, but it is questionable whether it could be said\r\n  that that decision in all its features results as I understand you\r\n  to claim.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You don’t so understand it? Will you say, as a matter of fact,\r\n  that none of the companies embraced within this trust have enjoyed\r\n  more favourable freight rates than the companies outside of your\r\n  trust? Will you say, as a matter of fact, that it is not so?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I stated in my testimony this morning that I had known of\r\n  instances where companies altogether outside of the trust had\r\n  enjoyed more favourable freights than companies in this trust; and I\r\n  am not able to state that there may not have been arrangements for\r\n  freight on the part of companies within this trust as favourable as,\r\n  or more favourable than, other freight arrangements; but, in reply\r\n  to that, nothing peculiar in respect to the companies in this\r\n  association; I suppose they make the best freight arrangements they\r\n  can.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe committee had a vague idea that refineries outside of the Standard\r\nCombination had had a hard time to live, and asked if the trust had\r\nsought in any way to make the operations of outsiders so unprofitable\r\nthat they would either have to come in or go out of the business.\r\n\r\n“They have not; no, sir, they have not,” replied Mr. Rockefeller.\r\n\r\n“And they have lived on good terms with their competitors?”\r\n\r\n“They have, and have to-day very pleasant relations with those\r\ngentlemen.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been interesting to have heard the comments of a number of\r\ngentlemen trying to carry on an independent business in 1888 on that\r\nanswer: of the refiners in Oil City and Titusville, at that time\r\npreparing to carry their troubles to the Interstate Commerce Commission;\r\nof George Rice and others at Marietta, Ohio; of H. H. Campbell, of the\r\nBear Creek Refining Company at Pittsburg; of Scofield, Shurmer and\r\nTeagle at Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIf all of Mr. Rockefeller’s testimony had been of the nature of the\r\nabove, the investigation would have been worth little to the people who\r\ndemanded it. But when it came to the questions which, after all, it was\r\nmost essential to have answered at that moment, Mr. Rockefeller, after\r\nsome skirmishing, gave the committee as frank testimony as is on record\r\nfrom him. The information wanted was in regard to the organisation of\r\nthe Standard Oil Trust. As pointed out in a previous chapter, there had\r\nbeen some kind of an agreement adopted in 1882, binding together the\r\nvaried interests which controlled the oil business. But what it was,\r\nwhere it was kept, by what authority it lived, nobody knew. For six\r\nyears it had succeeded in hiding itself. What was the understanding\r\nwhich had made a trust of a company? The committee asked to know. Mr.\r\nRockefeller and his counsel were the soul of amiability under the\r\ndemand. They had only one request, and Mr. Choate made it persuasively:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “If the committee please,” he said, “I do not arise to make an\r\n  objection to a request of the committee; we think that it is very\r\n  proper that the committee should be made acquainted with this\r\n  document and everything pertaining to it in order to advise them as\r\n  to the nature and operation of this trust; at the same time, there\r\n  are private interests and controversies involved which might be\r\n  seriously prejudiced by a public exposition of its details, and\r\n  therefore, in producing it, we, without asking the committee to make\r\n  any promise or to commit themselves at all, request that while they\r\n  make whatever use of it they please, it shall not be in all its\r\n  details made a matter of public record or exhibition unless in their\r\n  final judgment, after consideration of the matter, they shall\r\n  consider it necessary. There are very important private interests\r\n  involved that ought not, under the guise of a public investigation,\r\n  to be interfered with.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe committee examined the document and concluded to include it in its\r\nreport.[125] Like all great things, it was simplicity itself—an\r\nagreement which anybody could understand, by which some fifty persons\r\nholding controlling interests in corporations, joint stock associations,\r\nand partnerships of different states, placed all their stock in the\r\nhands of nine trustees, receiving in return trust certificates. These\r\nnine trustees themselves owned a majority of the stock and had complete\r\ncontrol of all the property. Mr. Rockefeller, when questioned, stated\r\nthat one of the trustees was a responsible officer in almost every\r\nrefinery or organisation in the trust; that the trustees, as a body,\r\nknew by reports and correspondence, and by frequent consultation in New\r\nYork with active promoters of each concern, just how the business was\r\ngoing on. “We all know how the business goes,” said Mr. Rockefeller; “we\r\nget reports once in thirty days showing what it has cost for\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nThe trustees evidently ran the entire great combination under the\r\nagreement. But consider the anomaly of the situation. Thirty-nine\r\ncorporations, each of them having a legal existence, obliged by the laws\r\nof the state creating it to limit its operations to certain lines and to\r\nmake certain reports, had turned over their affairs to an organisation\r\nhaving no legal existence, independent of all authority, able to do\r\nanything it wanted anywhere; and to this point working in absolute\r\ndarkness. Under their agreement, which was unrecognised by the state, a\r\nfew men had united to do things which no incorporated company could do.\r\nIt was a situation as puzzling as it was new. The committee in reporting\r\non what it discovered did nothing to solve the puzzle. It simply sounded\r\na warning:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The actual value of property in the trust control at the present\r\n  time is not less than one hundred and forty-eight millions of\r\n  dollars, according to the testimony of the trust’s president before\r\n  your committee. This sum in the hands of nine men, energetic,\r\n  intelligent, and aggressive—and the trustees themselves, as has been\r\n  said, own a majority of the stock of the trust which absolutely\r\n  controls the one hundred and forty-eight millions of dollars—is one\r\n  of the most active and possibly the most formidable moneyed power on\r\n  this continent. Its influence reaches into every state and is felt\r\n  in remote villages, and the products of its refineries seek a market\r\n  in almost every seaport on the globe. When it is remembered that all\r\n  this vast wealth is the growth of about twenty years, that this\r\n  property has more than doubled in value in six years, and that with\r\n  this increase the trust has made aggregate dividends during that\r\n  period of over fifty millions of dollars, the people may well look\r\n  with apprehension at such rapid development and centralisation of\r\n  wealth wholly independent of legal control, and anxiously seek out\r\n  means to modify, if not to prevent, the natural consequence of the\r\n  device producing it, a device of late invention, namely, the\r\n  aggregation of great corporations into partnerships with unbounded\r\n  resources and a field of operations quite as extended as its\r\n  resources. So much for the nature of the Standard Oil Trust. The\r\n  committee regret that they are not able to make a more complete and\r\n  satisfactory report as to the method of its operations and its\r\n  effect upon public interests.\r\n\r\n  “The brevity of the time within which the investigation was required\r\n  to be made rendered it impossible for your committee to do more than\r\n  examine the persons most prominent in the management of its affairs.\r\n  Its cause was thus presented to the most favourable light possible,\r\n  and it is only fair to conclude that nothing was left unsaid by them\r\n  that could be said in its favour. No witness came forward to accuse\r\n  it of the great offences commonly laid to its charge. No proofs were\r\n  made of its rapacity or of the greed with which it lays hold of\r\n  every competitive industry, except such as might be drawn from the\r\n  fact that it is the almost sole occupant of the field of oil\r\n  operations, from which it has driven nearly every competitor. No\r\n  witness appeared to prove its power over railroad and transportation\r\n  companies and to wring from already impoverished lines better terms\r\n  than other shippers, except such as might be drawn from the\r\n  admission of its officers, made with hesitation, that this wealth\r\n  and the amount of its business enabled it to obtain better terms\r\n  than its poorer competitors.”[126]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New York Senate made its investigation of trusts in February, 1888.\r\nIn March the Committee on Manufactures of the House of Representatives\r\nbegan a similar inquiry. This committee, like the earlier one, made the\r\nStandard its principal subject. Fully 1,000 pages of a report of 1,500\r\npages are devoted to Mr. Rockefeller’s creation—five times the space\r\ngiven to the Sugar Trust, ten times that given to the Whiskey Trust. The\r\ntestimony was wide in range. Indeed, from the volume alone, a pretty\r\ncomplete history of the Standard Oil Company up to 1888 could be\r\nwritten. Here are found the South Improvement Company charter and\r\ncontracts in full. Here is Mr. Cassatt’s testimony, taken in the case of\r\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania _vs._ the Pennsylvania Railroad,\r\nshowing the character of the rebates the Standard Combination was able\r\nto secure from the railroads at that time. Here is a partial history of\r\nthe growth of the Standard pipe-lines. Many personal histories of\r\nrefiners driven out of business by the conditions brought about by\r\nrailroad discriminations; full accounts of the war of the producing\r\nelement on the Standard; all of the testimony in the Buffalo case, where\r\ntwo refiners were found guilty of conspiring to ruin an independent\r\nrefining concern; the reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission in\r\nthe cases of George Rice; and much interesting explanation of various\r\nmatters by leading Standard Oil officials appear in the report.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller was on the stand, and one item of his testimony affords\r\na curious comparison. On the 28th of February, when before the New York\r\nSenate committee, Mr. Rockefeller was asked if he was not a member of\r\nthe South Improvement Company.\r\n\r\n“I was not,” he replied.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of the April following, when before the House Committee, the\r\nfollowing colloquy took place:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I want the names particularly of gentlemen who either now or in\r\n  the past have been interested with you gentlemen who were in the\r\n  South Improvement Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think they were O. T. Waring, W. P. Logan, John Logan, W. G.\r\n  Warden, O. H. Payne, H. M. Flagler, William Rockefeller, J. A.\r\n  Bostwick, and—_myself_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this investigation that Henry M. Flagler gave explanations of\r\nvarious operations of the Standard, which have been quoted in the course\r\nof this narrative, notably explanations of the South Improvement\r\nCompany, of the ten-cent rebate secured from all the railroads in 1875,\r\nof the purchase of the Empire Transportation Company, of the rebate on\r\nother people’s shipments enjoyed in 1878 by the American Transfer\r\nCompany. Some of Mr. Flagler’s testimony in this investigation compares\r\nas curiously with affidavits of his made in 1880 as does that of his\r\ngreat chief. For instance, in 1880 Mr. Flagler swore that “the Standard\r\nOil Company owns and operates its refineries at Cleveland, Ohio, and\r\nalso a refinery at Bayonne in the state of New Jersey. That at no other\r\nplace in the United States does the said Standard Oil Company _own_,\r\noperate, or control any refinery or refineries.”[127] But in this\r\ninvestigation the following colloquy took place:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When did the Standard Company of Ohio first enter into an\r\n  alliance with other refineries?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If you mean (by) an alliance, Mr. Gowen, I should say never.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I am only endeavouring to aid your friends in getting at what\r\n  they want. Here, I notice, they propose to prove by you—I will give\r\n  it in this way—that on account of the disastrous condition of the\r\n  refining business, the Standard, on October 15, 1874, entered into\r\n  an alliance with a number of Pittsburg refineries.\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is more correctly stated by saying that the Standard Oil\r\n  Company _purchased_ the refineries owned by the parties in\r\n  Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Who were they?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Lockhart, Frew and Company, I think, was the company. Wait a\r\n  moment. It was the Standard Oil Company of Pittsburg, it being a\r\n  corporation, and Warden, Frew and Company, of Philadelphia, and, I\r\n  should say, Charles Pratt and Company, of New York.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Any others?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is all.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ All those gentlemen, Warden, Frew and Company, and the Standard\r\n  Oil Company of Pittsburg, Charles Pratt and Company, of New York,\r\n  are now associated with you as parties interested in the present Oil\r\n  Trust?\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A._ They are stockholders. The property formerly owned by them was\r\n  at that time purchased by the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of purchasing their interest, you do not exclude\r\n  them from their interest? They united with you and remained as your\r\n  associates in the business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If it was not from the fact that ours was a corporation, we\r\n  might call it a co-partnership.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ They becoming interested in yours, and you in theirs?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And you simply used your name to represent the joint ownership,\r\n  as it was a corporation?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.[128]\r\n\r\n\r\nFull as the testimony on the Standard Oil Trust gathered by the Federal\r\ncommittee of 1888 is, its report touched but one point, and that was its\r\norganisation. To the committee it seemed that the agreement under which\r\nthe trust operated was such as to make it exempt from the anti-trust\r\nlegislation which was then contemplated by Congress. The legislation\r\nproposed was directed against “combinations to fix the price or regulate\r\nthe production of merchandise or commerce.” Now a mass of testimony had\r\nbeen presented showing that, from the starting-point of the Standard’s\r\nhistory with the South Improvement Company, its aim has been to regulate\r\nthe output of refined oil so as to fix the price, but this testimony,\r\nthe committee saw clearly enough, did not apply to the trust which it\r\nwas investigating. For—so swore the trustees—they had nothing to do with\r\nthe business operations of the separate concerns. They simply held the\r\nstock of the various corporations, exercised their right as\r\nstockholders, received and distributed the dividends. Each company did\r\nits own business in its own way. The trustees were not responsible for\r\nit. There was something humorous to those familiar with the oil world,\r\nin the idea of J. D. Rockefeller, William Rockefeller, J. D. Archbold,\r\nHenry H. Rogers, Charles Pratt, H. M. Flagler, Benjamin Brewster, W. H.\r\nTilford and O. B. Jennings, having nothing to do, as trustees of the\r\nStandard Oil Trust, but to receive and divide dividends, engrossing and\r\ninteresting a task as that undoubtedly was. But, as a matter of fact,\r\nnothing else could be settled on them by anything in the testimony. For\r\ninstance, in 1887 there was an alliance formed between the Oil\r\nProducers’ Protective Association and the Standard for limiting the\r\nproduction of crude oil (a movement of which we shall hear more later).\r\nThis certainly was in restraint of trade. But, on examination, the\r\ncommittee found the contract had been signed by the Standard Oil Company\r\nof New York. The trustees had nothing to do with it! Taking up, point by\r\npoint, the conditions of which the oil producers complained, not one of\r\nthem could be fixed on the trust. It had made no agreements, signed no\r\ncontracts, kept no books. It had no legal existence. It was a force\r\npowerful as gravitation and as intangible. You could argue its existence\r\nfrom its effects, but you could never prove it. You could no more grasp\r\nit than you could an eel. Certainly the Committee on Manufactures was\r\njustified in confining its report to pointing out the fact that the\r\nStandard Oil Trust agreement was a shrewd and slippery device for\r\nevading responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd there the investigations of 1888 ended. There had been much noise\r\nover them, and for what good? So asked the discontented oil public. It\r\nsimply had secured the form of an agreement which could no more be\r\ntouched by legislation than human greed. It was characteristic that the\r\noil public, intent on immediate remedies, should be discouraged. If they\r\nhad applied to their cause the same patience and foresight Mr.\r\nRockefeller did to his, they would have realised that, as a matter of\r\nfact, a respectable first step had been taken toward their real goal, a\r\ngoal which has not by any means been reached—that is, a legal form of\r\norganisation for corporations doing interstate business which would\r\nenable the public to know promptly if they were securing special\r\nprivileges or were restricting trade. This first step was in securing\r\nthe famous trust agreement. That was now in the hands of people given to\r\nthinking about things, and something came of it, even more quickly than\r\nthe philosophical observer of public events might expect, and in this\r\nwise:\r\n\r\nIn 1887 there was elected to the attorney-generalship of Ohio a lawyer,\r\nsomething under forty years of age, named David K. Watson. Two years\r\nlater Mr. Watson was a candidate for re-election. One day, while busy\r\nwith his campaign, he came out of his office in the state-house on the\r\npublic square in Columbus, and, crossing the street, stopped, as he\r\noften did, at a book-shop to look over new publications. He happened\r\nthere on a small yellow leatherette volume entitled “Trusts.” It was\r\nwritten by William W. Cook, of the New York bar, and cost fifty cents.\r\nMr. Watson bought the book and spent the evening reading it. At the end\r\nhe found the Standard Oil Trust agreement. It was the first time he had\r\never seen it. He read it carefully and saw at once that, if it was a\r\nbona fide agreement, the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was and had been\r\nfor seven years violating the laws of the state of Ohio by taking the\r\naffairs of the company from the directors and placing them in the hands\r\nof trustees, nearly all of whom were non-residents of the state. Mr.\r\nWatson knew on the instant that, if this were a bona fide agreement and\r\nhe were re-elected attorney-general of Ohio, it would be his duty to\r\nbring an action against the Standard Oil Company of the state. He laid\r\nthe little book away until he knew the result of the election.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DAVID K. WATSON\r\n\r\n  Attorney-General of Ohio from 1887 to 1891.

He at once\r\nbegan a search into the authenticity of the documents in Mr. Cook’s\r\nlittle volume. He sent for the reports of the investigations by the\r\ncommittees of the New York Senate and of Congress. He read the testimony\r\nword for word. But he still doubted the correctness of the document,\r\nfearing that, even if it were in the main correct, there might be some\r\nloophole by which the Standard Oil Company could escape. Now, in reading\r\nthe report of the House investigations, Mr. Watson had been particularly\r\nimpressed with the clearness and directness of the questions put by one\r\nof the members of the investigating committee, Mr. Buchanan, of New\r\nJersey. He accordingly went to Washington, inquired from a friend if Mr.\r\nBuchanan could be relied upon, and, receiving the assurance of his high\r\ncharacter, sought an interview with him. “Was the Standard trust\r\nagreement as published in the committee’s report _bona fide_?” was the\r\ninquiry. “Yes,” said Mr. Buchanan. “But why do you ask?” “Because if it\r\nis,” replied Mr. Watson, “I believe the Standard Oil Company of Ohio has\r\nviolated the laws of the state, and on my return to Columbus I shall\r\nfile an action in _quo warranto_ against it in the Supreme Court of the\r\nstate.”\r\n\r\n“You would not _dare_ do that, would you?” exclaimed Mr. Buchanan.\r\n\r\n“I was young then,” Mr. Watson told the writer in describing this\r\ninterview, “and I supposed it was expected of a public officer to\r\nperform his duty. So I explained to Mr. Buchanan that there was a\r\nstatute in Ohio which required an attorney-general to bring suit against\r\nany corporation which he had reason to believe was violating the laws of\r\nthe state; that I had no personal feeling against the Standard Oil\r\nCompany, but I meant to enforce the law against it as I would against\r\nany other company which I believed to be violating the law.”\r\n\r\n“I admire your courage,” said Mr. Buchanan, “but I would not do it.”\r\n\r\nOn May 8, 1890, Mr. Watson filed his petition in the Supreme Court of\r\nOhio.[129] The petition averred that, in violation of the law of Ohio,\r\nthe Standard Oil Company had entered into an agreement by which it had\r\ntransferred 34,993 shares out of 35,000 to the trustees of the Standard\r\nOil Trust, most of whom were non-residents of the state; that it was\r\nthese trustees who chose the board of directors of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Ohio, and directed its policy, and prayed that, on account of\r\nthis violation of law, the company should be “adjudged to have forfeited\r\nand surrendered its corporate rights, privileges, powers and franchises,\r\nand that it be ousted and excluded therefrom, and that it be dissolved.”\r\n\r\nThe petition came on the trust like a thunderbolt. There had been\r\nalready more or less erratic and ill-advised anti-trust legislation in\r\nvarious states, but it had been framed in ignorance of the actual\r\norganisation of the trust, and carried out with a crude notion that the\r\ntrust, in spite of the fact that it was already thoroughly intrenched in\r\nthe business life of the country, could be destroyed by a hostile act of\r\na Legislature. Mr. Watson’s suit was something very different. It was an\r\napplication of recognised laws to admitted facts. It brought the\r\nStandard Oil Company face to face with several legal propositions it did\r\nnot like to meet. After a long delay an answer was filed by the\r\nStandard. To Mr. Watson’s joy, the one thing he feared—the denial of the\r\ncorrectness of the agreement—made no part of this answer. It admitted\r\nthe agreement, but it denied that the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was a\r\nparty to it. The agreement was signed by the individual stockholders of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company, not by the company in its corporate capacity.\r\nThe Standard Oil Company of Ohio had nothing to do with the Standard Oil\r\nTrust. True, certain of its stockholders had turned over their stock to\r\nthe nine trustees, but the company did its business as before,\r\ndischarging all its duties as its charter required. This was the\r\nessential point of the defendant’s answer. This, and the claim that if\r\nthe court should hold that the action of the stockholders in becoming\r\nparties to the agreement in their individual capacity was a corporate\r\nact of the Standard Oil Company, even then the charter should not be\r\nforfeited, since the law barred an act committed more than five years\r\nbefore a petition was filed.\r\n\r\nAnticipating that the trust would get together a strong array of counsel\r\nto defend its attacked member, Mr. Watson retained his personal and\r\nprofessional friend, John W. Warrington, an eminent lawyer of\r\nCincinnati, to assist him. They were opposed by Joseph H. Choate, S. C.\r\nT. Dodd and Virgil P. Kline of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nBut, while the preparation for the argument of the case was going on,\r\nthe courageous young attorney-general was beset on all sides for an\r\nexplanation. _Why_ had he brought the suit? What was the influence which\r\nhad controlled him? Men in power took him aside to question him,\r\nincapable, evidently, of believing that an attorney-general could be\r\nproduced in Ohio who would bring a suit solely because he believed it\r\nwas his duty. Some suggested that some big interest, hostile to the\r\nStandard, was behind him; others said the suit was suggested by Senator\r\nSherman, then interested in his anti-trust bill. Along with this\r\nspeculation came the strong and subtle restraining pressure a great\r\ncorporation is sure to exert when its ambitions are interfered with.\r\nFrom all sides came powerful persuasion that the suit be dropped. Mr.\r\nWatson has never made public the details of this influence in any\r\ndocumentary way, but the accounts he at the time gave different friends\r\nof it led to so much gossip in Ohio that in 1899 the attorney-general of\r\nthe state, F. S. Monnett, made detailed charges of six deliberate\r\nattempts to bribe Mr. Watson to withdraw the suits.[130] But one bit of\r\ndocumentary proof of the efforts to reach the attorney-general ever\r\nreached the public—that came out without his knowledge or consent, Mr.\r\nWatson claims, seven years after the suit was brought. It is interesting\r\nenough as evidence of the character of the pressure Mr. Rockefeller can\r\nset in motion when he will. Among Mr. Rockefeller’s Ohio friends was the\r\nlate Marcus A. Hanna, who was even then a strong factor in the\r\nRepublican party of the state. A few months after the suit was brought\r\nhe wrote Mr. Watson a letter of remonstrance. Many of Mr. Watson’s\r\nfriends saw this letter at the time and felt deep indignation over its\r\ncontents. In 1897, when Mr. Hanna was a candidate for the United States\r\nSenate, an enterprising newspaper man of Ohio recalled that during 1890\r\nit was common gossip in Ohio that Mr. Hanna had written the\r\nattorney-general a letter asking him to withdraw his suit against the\r\nStandard Oil Company. The correspondent sought Mr. Watson, who, so he\r\navers, let him read the letter through, although he refused to allow him\r\nto copy it for publication. “No one could read it and ever forget it,”\r\nsaid the correspondent; but to reinforce himself he sought persons who\r\nwere associated with Mr. Watson at the time—yes, they remembered the\r\nletter perfectly. Certain of them said that they could never forget some\r\nof its expressions. Between them they pieced up the following portions\r\nof the letter which they declared correct and which the correspondent\r\npublished in the New York World for August 11, 1897:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I noticed some time ago that you had brought suit to take away the\r\n  charter of the Standard Oil Company. I intended at the time to write\r\n  you about it, but it slipped my memory. A few days ago while in New\r\n  York I met a friend, John D. Rockefeller, and he called my attention\r\n  to the fact that you had brought the suit, but did not ask me to\r\n  influence you in any way.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “I have always considered you in the line of political promotion,”\r\n  said Hanna, and then went on to intimate that unless the suit\r\n  against the Standard was withdrawn, Watson would be the object of\r\n  vengeance by the corporation and its friends forever after. As if to\r\n  clinch his threat and argument, Hanna wrote: “_You have been in\r\n  politics long enough to know that no man in public office owes the\r\n  public anything._”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GROUP OF CLEVELAND CITIZENS\r\n\r\n  Who called on John D. Rockefeller at his residence, “Forest Hill,”\r\n    on July 25, 1896, to thank him for his gift of park lands to the\r\n    city. Mr. Rockefeller is in the centre of the group, the late\r\n    Senator Marcus A. Hanna in the right lower corner, and Governor\r\n    Myron T. Herrick in the centre of the top row.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The letter concluded with a reference to the present Secretary of\r\n  State, John Sherman. Hanna wrote: “I understood that Senator Sherman\r\n  inspired and instigated this suit. If this is so I will take\r\n  occasion to talk to him sharply when I see him.”\r\n\r\n  The letter was written on the typewriter and letter-heads of Hanna’s\r\n  business office in Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving secured this much, the correspondent, thinking it possible Mr.\r\nWatson might have answered Mr. Hanna’s letter, undertook a bit of\r\noriginal investigation. He sought the files of the attorney-general’s\r\nofficial correspondence for 1890, and the following is what he found.\r\nThis letter certainly is evidence enough of the sort of letter Mr. Hanna\r\nhad written even if the above restoration is not absolutely accurate:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    December 13, 1890.\r\n\r\n  HON. MARK HANNA,\r\n      Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  _My dear Sir_:—Your communication of the 21st ult. came to hand. The\r\n  delay in answering it has been caused largely by my being ill for\r\n  several days. I did not intend that bringing the action to which you\r\n  refer in your letter should be an attack on my part on “organised\r\n  capital,” for I am aware that great business transactions require\r\n  the union and concentration of moneyed interests, and fully\r\n  appreciate what has been done in that direction, yet I cannot but\r\n  feel that I am justified in bringing the suit against the Standard\r\n  Oil Company, and believe that there are many things relating to the\r\n  case which, if you understood, would cause you to entertain\r\n  different views concerning it and my relation to it. Let me impress\r\n  one thing on you with special particularity, and you may depend\r\n  absolutely on its truthfulness. Senator Sherman never suggested or\r\n  encouraged this suit, either directly or indirectly. This must be\r\n  understood in its broadest sense. The report probably arose from the\r\n  fact that the action was brought shortly after the Senator made his\r\n  great speech in support of his anti-trust bill. You will hardly\r\n  receive my statement with favour, I fear, but I am alone responsible\r\n  for the action. No one encouraged me to bring it or knew that it\r\n  would be brought until I determined to do so, and it is unfair to\r\n  other persons to charge them with suggesting it or encouraging it.\r\n  With the highest appreciation of your personal friendship, I am,\r\n  with great respect,\r\n\r\n                              Truly yours,\r\n                                                      DAVID K. WATSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe part which the terse phrase attributed to Mr. Hanna,\r\n\r\n          “NO MAN IN PUBLIC OFFICE OWES THE PUBLIC ANYTHING,”\r\n\r\nplayed in the Senatorial campaign of 1897 is familiar to those who\r\nfollow politics. It was kept standing for days in black-faced capitals\r\nat the head of the opposition newspapers in Ohio, and remained a potent\r\nweapon in the hands of Mr. Hanna’s enemies to the time of his death.\r\n\r\nWhatever the pressure Mr. Watson encountered, it had no effect on his\r\npurpose. He quietly went ahead, presented his brief, and, when the time\r\ncame, he and Mr. Warrington argued the case. The following proposition\r\nfrom the brief presented by Mr. Watson and Mr. Warrington show tersely\r\nthe line of their argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Where the manifest object of an agreement is to unite corporations,\r\n  partnerships and individuals into, or include them in a common\r\n  enterprise, and control them through an agency unknown to the law of\r\n  their creation, and all the officers, directors and stockholders of\r\n  such corporations sign the agreement, and, in furtherance of its\r\n  provisions, transfer their stock to such agency, permit the\r\n  corporate executive agencies to make such transfers on the corporate\r\n  books, submit without objection to the domination of the agency to\r\n  which the stock is so transferred in the selection of directors and\r\n  officers, and in the management of the corporate affairs and\r\n  business suffer the corporate earnings to go to such agency and be\r\n  placed and mingled with the earnings of the other parties in the\r\n  combination so created, and, after deductions for uses of the\r\n  combination, be divided as part of such common earnings among the\r\n  persons interested, in such case the corporations become and are—or\r\n  at least will be treated by the courts as—parties to such agreement\r\n  and actors in its performance, although their corporate names are\r\n  withheld therefrom. Such proceedings constitute actual corporate\r\n  conduct, if not formal corporate action, on the part of each\r\n  corporation.\r\n\r\n  “An agreement is in violation of law and void which in effect\r\n  creates a partnership between corporations, or where its probable\r\n  operation and effect—much more where its inevitable tendency—is to\r\n  create a substantial monopoly, or is in restraint of trade or\r\n  otherwise injurious to the public.\r\n\r\n  “Where a corporation, either directly or indirectly, submits to the\r\n  domination of an agency unknown to the statute, or identifies itself\r\n  with and unites in carrying out an agreement whose performance is\r\n  injurious to the public, it thereby offends against the law of its\r\n  creation and forfeits all rights to its franchises, and judgment of\r\n  ouster should be entered against it.\r\n\r\n  “Even if the statute which prescribes a time within which an action\r\n  against a corporation for forfeiture of its charter shall be\r\n  commenced, be applicable to a case of this kind, yet, where the\r\n  offences or acts committed or omitted by a corporation for which\r\n  forfeiture of its charter is sought at the suit of the state, are\r\n  concealed, or are of such character as to conceal themselves, such\r\n  offences and acts as against the state are frauds, and such statute\r\n  does not begin to run until the frauds are discovered.”\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph H. Choate appeared for the defence. The most eminent lawyer in\r\nthe country, his argument must have been anxiously awaited by Mr.\r\nWatson. Curiously enough, as it seems to the non-legal mind, Mr. Choate\r\nbegan his plea by a _prayer for mercy_. Whatever the sins of the\r\nStandard Oil Company of Ohio, pleaded Mr. Choate, do not take away its\r\ncharter. Mr. Choate then proceeded with a strong argument in which he\r\nclaimed “absolute innocence and absolute merit for everything we have\r\ndone within the scope of the matters brought before the court by these\r\npleadings.”\r\n\r\nThe argument did not convince the court of the innocence of the Standard\r\nin the questions at issue. The court showed, out of the mouth of the\r\ntrust agreement itself, that the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was\r\n“managed in the interest of the Standard Oil Trust—irrespective of what\r\nmight be its duties to the people of the state from which it derives its\r\ncorporate life.” The court gave as its opinion that an act of a majority\r\nof the stockholders of a corporation affects the property of a company\r\nin the same way that a resolution by the board of directors affects it.\r\n“By this agreement,” said the court, “indirectly, it is true, but none\r\nthe less effectually, the defendant is controlled and managed by the\r\nStandard Oil Trust, an association with its principal place of business\r\nin New York City, and organised for a purpose contrary to the policy of\r\nour laws. Its object was to establish a virtual monopoly of the business\r\nof producing petroleum, and of manufacturing, refining and dealing in it\r\nand all its products, throughout the entire country, and by which it\r\nmight not merely control the production, but the price, at its pleasure.\r\nAll such associations are contrary to the policy of our state and void.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Much has been said in favour of the objects of the Standard Oil Trust\r\nand what it has accomplished. It may be true that it has improved the\r\nquality and cheapened the cost of petroleum and its products to the\r\nconsumer. But such is not one of the usual or general results of a\r\nmonopoly; and it is the policy of the law to regard, not what may, but\r\nwhat usually happens. Experience shows that it is not wise to trust\r\nhuman cupidity where it has the opportunity to aggrandise itself at the\r\nexpense of others. The claim of having cheapened the price to the\r\nconsumer is the usual pretext on which monopolies of this kind are\r\ndefended.”[131]\r\n\r\nFrom all this the court decided the Standard Oil Company deserved\r\npunishment. The charter was not taken away—the statute of limitations\r\nbeing advanced as a reason for this leniency, although, as Mr. Watson\r\nand Mr. Warrington showed, the statute of limitations could hardly be\r\npleaded in this case, when the state had been kept in ignorance by the\r\nconcealment of the agreement. The company was allowed to live, but it\r\nwas ousted from the privilege of entering into the trust agreement, from\r\nthe power of recognising the transfer of the stock, and from the power\r\nof permitting the trustees to control its affairs. It was also ordered\r\nto pay the costs of the action.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the court was not rendered until March 2, 1892, almost\r\ntwo years after the filing of the petition. As soon as it was received\r\nVirgil P. Kline, the chief counsel of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio,\r\nwent to New York for consultation with the trustees. Five days later he\r\nwrote to Judge Spear, the chief justice of the Ohio Supreme Court,\r\nsaying: “Decisive steps will be taken at once not only to release the\r\nStandard Oil Company from any relations to the trust, but to terminate\r\nthe entire trust.” But there were “practical difficulties” in the task.\r\nThe company pleaded for a “temporary recognition,” and he asked an\r\ninterview where he could explain the situation. This was granted, and on\r\nthe 16th of March Mr. Kline explained to the judges in chambers, to Mr.\r\nWatson, and to his successor in office, the situation of the company.\r\nThe trustees had all but seven shares of its stock. Trust certificates\r\nhad been issued for these ten years before. The Standard Oil Company did\r\nnot know who held these certificates, and could only know through the\r\ntrustees, therefore the trust certificates must be transferred back, the\r\nowners hunted up, and each one induced to make an exchange. A system\r\nmust be devised for doing this. Anybody could see this would take time.\r\nThe court was friendly in the matter, and Chief Justice Spear gave to\r\nMr. Kline an informal note granting an extension. “The court is not\r\ndisposed to change its order at this time,” the chief justice wrote,\r\n“but, so long as those in control appear to be engaged, as now, in an\r\nhonest effort to dissever the relations of the company with the trust,\r\nand liquidate and wind up the affairs of the trust, the court will not\r\nbe disposed to interfere.” Thus time was gained.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Kline was securing time, the trustees were pushing a\r\nliquidation scheme. On March 11 the following notice was mailed to all\r\nholders of Standard Oil Trust certificates, and was published in a\r\nnewspaper in each state where a Standard Oil Company had been organised:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTICE\r\n\r\n  A special meeting of the holders of Standard Oil Trust certificates\r\n  will be held at the office of the trust, Number 26 Broadway, in the\r\n  City of New York, on Monday, March 21, 1892, at eleven o’clock A.M.,\r\n  for the purpose of voting upon a resolution to terminate the trust\r\n  agreement, in accordance with the terms of said agreement, and to\r\n  take such further action as may be thereby rendered necessary.\r\n\r\n                                           H. M. FLAGLER, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held as called. Mr. Rockefeller was in the chair, and\r\nMr. Dodd, who had drawn the trust agreement, now presented the\r\nresolution which was to dissolve it. The remarks with which Mr. Dodd\r\nintroduced his resolution denied every point which the courts had\r\ncharged against the combination:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Something over ten years ago,” said Mr. Dodd, “a few individuals\r\n  owning stocks in a number of corporations engaged in transporting\r\n  and refining oil, entered into an agreement by which their stocks\r\n  were placed in the hands of trustees, and certificates were issued\r\n  by said trustees showing the amount of each owner’s equitable\r\n  interest in the stocks so held in trust. This was not done in order\r\n  to vest the voting power in the hands of a few persons, because the\r\n  persons chosen as trustees then held, and always have held, the\r\n  voting power by virtue of their absolute ownership of a majority of\r\n  the stocks. It was not done to reduce competition, because the\r\n  companies whose stocks were placed in trust were not competing\r\n  companies, and could not be so long as their stocks were owned by\r\n  these few persons. It was not done to limit production or to\r\n  increase prices, but, on the contrary, was done to increase\r\n  production, cheapen cost of manufacture, and to lower prices, and it\r\n  has been successful in that object far beyond the anticipations of\r\n  those who originated the plan. It was called a trust, because it was\r\n  a trust in the sense in which the word was then understood. It\r\n  vested a fiduciary obligation in a few for the benefit of many, and\r\n  the trustees thus created have faithfully observed the trust\r\n  confided in them.\r\n\r\n  “Other persons, however, found this trust plan a convenient one, and\r\n  it is alleged that it has been adopted for and adapted to purposes\r\n  quite different from those which actuated the framers of this trust.\r\n  Whether these allegations be true or false, it is true that a trust\r\n  is now defined to be a combination to suppress competition and to\r\n  reduce production, and to increase prices. Public opinion has not\r\n  unwisely been aroused against combinations for such purposes, and\r\n  legislation of more or less severity, and rather more or less\r\n  peculiarity, has been directed against them in seventeen or eighteen\r\n  states of the Union. All such arrangements are now miscalled trusts,\r\n  and all trusts are popularly supposed to partake of the same nature.\r\n  For this reason, if for no other, it should be seriously considered\r\n  whether this trust should not be terminated. So long as it exists,\r\n  misconception of its purposes will exist.\r\n\r\n  “But another reason exists which seems to make it desirable to\r\n  dissolve this trust. Some two years ago a _quo warranto_ issued in\r\n  the name of the state of Ohio against the Standard Oil Company, a\r\n  corporation of the state of Ohio, setting forth this trust agreement\r\n  and alleging that that corporation, by becoming a party thereto, had\r\n  done an act beyond its power, and thereby had forfeited its charter.\r\n  The defendant corporation denied that it was a party to the\r\n  agreement, and alleged that the agreement was on its face, and\r\n  plainly, an agreement only between individuals, owners of corporate\r\n  stocks, relating to their personal property, and was neither made by\r\n  the corporation nor for the corporation. The court, however, held\r\n  that the agreement was a corporate agreement, and decreed, among\r\n  other things, that the corporation must cease to permit trustees to\r\n  vote upon stocks held in trust.\r\n\r\n  “As this agreement was not entered into as a corporate agreement,\r\n  and as this decision gives it an effect quite different from the\r\n  intent of the parties who entered into it, it seems better to end\r\n  it.”[132]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Mr. Dodd had foreseen from the first just such an\r\nattack on his agreement as had come, for he had put into that instrument\r\na paragraph providing for a dissolution, and it was in accordance with\r\nthat article that the trust was now dissolved. The trustees were to\r\ncontinue to exist—under a new name: “Liquidating trustees.” The property\r\nthey had to take care of was vastly in excess of what it had been ten\r\nyears before. Then the capital of the thirty-nine constituent companies\r\nwas $70,000,000. These companies had been combined until they had been\r\nreduced to twenty, and their combined capital was now $102,233,700.[133]\r\nProperty of about $20,000,000 in excess of the capital was held by the\r\ntrustees. Mr. Dodd’s resolution provided for the division of this\r\nproperty, and for the transfer of the trust certificates back to the\r\ncorporations to which they belonged. The individual holders of the trust\r\ncertificates were to get in exchange a proportionate share in each of\r\nthe twenty companies. “A will not get stock in one corporation and B in\r\nanother; each will get his due proportion in the stocks of all,” said\r\nMr. Dodd. All of this change would make no difference with the\r\nmanagement of affairs. Mr. Dodd assured the stockholders: “Your\r\ninterests will be the same as now. The various corporations will\r\ncontinue to do the same business as heretofore, and your proportion of\r\nthe earnings will not be changed.”\r\n\r\nThe trustees went about liquidating at once, but it was not until the\r\nfollowing November that the immense number of certificates held by them\r\npersonally were exchanged. The process followed can be easily\r\nillustrated by Mr. Rockefeller’s case. When the trust was ordered\r\ndissolved Mr. Rockefeller held 256,854 of the 972,500 shares of Standard\r\nOil Trust which were out. He turned over to an attorney an assignment of\r\nthis amount, with instructions to secure from each of twenty companies\r\nin the trust stock certificates for the portion belonging to him. The\r\ncorporate stocks were turned over to Mr. Rockefeller, and the assignment\r\nof certificate, a properly framed and numbered document, was turned over\r\nto the liquidating trustees. This assignment of legal title, for all\r\npractical purposes, was the same thing as the trust certificate. It\r\nenabled the trustees to collect dividends from the various companies and\r\npay them just as they had before. The documents showing the formal\r\nprocedure in the case of Mr. Rockefeller’s stocks are printed in the\r\nAppendix.[134]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year, after the dissolution of the trust,\r\n477,881 shares were uncancelled. At the end of the second year it was\r\nthe same; at the end of the third, 477,881 were still out. At the end of\r\nthe fourth, 477,881. The dissolution of the trust seemed to have come to\r\na stand-still. Mr. Dodd was right; things were going on as they did\r\nbefore; dividends were issued exactly as before. Nor was there any\r\nindication of an intention on the part of the liquidating trustees to\r\nchange this state of things. If the monopolistic power of the Standard\r\nOil Trust was to be broken, it was evidently not to be by any order of\r\ndissolution by the courts. Something more powerful than the courts was\r\nat work, however. The spirit of individualism was beginning to reassert\r\nitself in the oil industry—a new war for independence had been begun,\r\nwas indeed well under way even before the state of Ohio made the\r\ndissolution of the trust necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n                     A MODERN WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n  PRODUCERS’ PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION FORMED—A SECRET INDEPENDENT\r\n    ORGANIZATION INTENDED TO HANDLE ITS OWN OIL—AGREEMENT MADE WITH\r\n    STANDARD TO CUT DOWN PRODUCTION—RESULTS OF AGREEMENT NOT AS\r\n    BENEFICIAL TO PRODUCERS AS EXPECTED—PRODUCERS PROCEED TO ORGANISE\r\n    PRODUCERS’ OIL COMPANY, LIMITED—INDEPENDENT REFINERS AGREE TO\r\n    SUPPORT MOVEMENT—PRODUCERS AND REFINERS’ COMPANY FORMED—LEWIS EMERY,\r\n    JR.’S, FIGHT FOR SEABOARD PIPE-LINE—THE UNITED STATES PIPE\r\n    LINE—STANDARD’S DESPERATE OPPOSITION—INDEPENDENT REFINERS ALMOST\r\n    WORN OUT—THEY ARE RELIEVED BY FORMATION OF PURE OIL\r\n    COMPANY—PURE OIL COMPANY FINALLY BECOMES HEAD OF INDEPENDENT\r\n    CONSOLIDATION—INDEPENDENCE POSSIBLE, BUT COMPETITION NOT RESTORED.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller’s one irreconcilable enemy in the oil business has\r\nalways been the oil producer. There is no doubt that Mr. Rockefeller has\r\nsincerely deplored this. And well he might, for he learned in his first\r\ngreat raid on the industry in 1872 that the producers aroused and united\r\nmade a powerful and dangerous foe.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, if it had been practical, Mr. Rockefeller would have begun at\r\nthe start to take over oil production as he did oil refineries and\r\npipe-lines, and thus would have gotten his enemy out of the way; but\r\nduring the first fifteen years of his work it was not practical. The oil\r\nfields were too vast and undefined. It not being practical to own the\r\noil fields, and yet essential that those who did own them, and of whose\r\noil he aspired to be the only buyer, should be kept sufficiently\r\nsatisfied not to interfere with his domination or to attempt to handle\r\nthe oil for themselves, Mr. Rockefeller, whenever he had the chance,\r\nsought to persuade the producers to do what he would have done had he\r\nowned the oil fields—that was, to keep the supply of crude oil short.\r\n\r\n“The dear people,” he said once when asked by an investigating committee\r\nif his monopoly of oil refining and oil transportation had not prevented\r\nthe producer from getting his full share of the profits—“the dear\r\npeople,” he said, “if they had produced less oil than they wanted, would\r\nhave got their full price; no combination in the world could have\r\nprevented that, if they had produced less oil than the world\r\nrequired.”[135]\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that if Mr. Rockefeller had been able to convert\r\nthe majority of the producing body to this theory, and the supply of\r\ncrude oil had been kept scarce and prices consequently high, the oil\r\nproducers would have forgotten their resentment at his early raids and\r\nwould have relapsed into indifference toward his control. Material\r\nprosperity is usually benumbing in its effects. There always has been a\r\nfactor in the great game playing in the Oil Regions, however, which not\r\neven Mr. Rockefeller could match. Nature has been in the oil game, and\r\nshe has taken pains to prevent the only situation which would have\r\nenabled Mr. Rockefeller to reconcile the oil producers. Again and again\r\nwhen it seemed as if the limits of oil production were set, and when Mr.\r\nRockefeller and his colleagues must have believed that they would soon\r\nhave the industry sufficiently well in hand to pay the producers a\r\nsatisfactory price for crude oil, their calculations have been upset by\r\nthe discovery of a great deposit of oil which flooded the market and put\r\ndown the prices. This happened so often between Mr. Rockefeller’s first\r\npublic appearance in the business and the time when he completed his\r\ncontrol of transportation, refineries and markets, that the yearly\r\nproduction of crude oil had risen from five and a half million barrels\r\nto thirty million barrels, and instead of a half million barrels above\r\nground in stocks there were in 1883 over thirty-five million barrels, in\r\n1884 nearly thirty-seven million, in 1885 thirty-three and a half\r\nmillion. The low price for crude which these vast stocks caused, the\r\nhigh charges for gathering, transporting and storing, all services out\r\nof which the Standard was making big profits, the fact that the profit\r\non refined oil steadily increased in these years—the result of the\r\noverthrow of independent refiners and pipe-lines—while the profit on\r\ncrude steadily diminished, were facts which the oil producers brooded\r\nover incessantly, and the more bitterly because they felt they could do\r\nnothing to help themselves. Every enterprise looking to relief which\r\nthey had undertaken had, for one reason or another, failed. They had no\r\nfaith that relief was possible. The Standard would never allow any\r\noutside interest to get a foothold. It was the bitterness which this\r\nconviction caused which was at the bottom of the outburst over the\r\nBillingsley Bill described in Chapter XIII. The Billingsley Bill was\r\ndefeated, as it deserved to be, but the work done was by no means lost.\r\nFor the first time since 1880 the Oil Regions were aroused to concerted\r\naction. The support of the Billingsley Bill had been a spontaneous\r\nmovement, a passionate, unorganised revolt against the tyranny of the\r\nStandard, but it served to bring into action men who for six long years\r\nhad been saying it was no use to resist, that Mr. Rockefeller’s grip was\r\ntoo strong to be loosened. It revived their confidence in united action\r\nand steeled them to a determination to take hold of the industry and\r\nforce into it again a fair competition in handling oil.\r\n\r\nOn the very night after the defeat of the bill (April 28, 1887) the oil\r\nmen who had gathered in Harrisburg to support the measure, angry and\r\nsore as they were, arranged to call an early meeting in Oil City and\r\norganise. The meeting was held. It was large, and it was followed by\r\nothers. In a very short time 2,000 oil men were enrolled in a Producers’\r\nProtective Association, and thirty-six local assemblies were holding\r\nregular meetings throughout the region. There were several important\r\npoints about the new association, aside from the enthusiasm and\r\ndetermination which animated it:\r\n\r\n(1) It was a secret order.\r\n\r\n(2) Its membership was composed entirely of persons outside of and\r\nopposed to the Standard Oil Trust, one of its by-laws reading: “No\r\nperson connected with the Standard Oil Company or any of its allies, as\r\npartners, stockholders, or employees, and friendly thereto, shall be\r\nelected to membership; and members becoming such shall be liable to\r\nexpulsion.”\r\n\r\n(3) It proposed “to defend the industry against the aggregations of\r\nmonopolistic transporters, refiners, buyers and sellers” by _handling\r\nits own oil_.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Producers’ Protective Association been organised before\r\nMr. Rockefeller had an opportunity to try his plan for conciliation. An\r\nindependent movement had been started in the summer of 1887 by certain\r\nlarge producers in favour of a general “shut-down,” its object, of\r\ncourse, being to decrease the oil stocks. The president of the\r\nProducers’ Association, Thomas W. Phillips, who at that time was the\r\nlargest individual producer in the oil country, his production averaging\r\nnot less than 6,000 barrels a day, was called into consultation with the\r\nleaders of the “shut-down” movement. Mr. Phillips promptly told the\r\ngentlemen interested that he would not join in such an undertaking\r\nunless the Standard went into it. He pointed out that the Standard owned\r\na large proportion of the 30,000,000 barrels of oil above ground. They\r\nhad bought it at low prices. If the production was shut down prices\r\nwould go up and the Standard would reap largely on the oil they owned.\r\nThe producers would, as usual, be standing all the loss.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of the council was that the Producers’ Protective Association\r\ntook hold of the shut-down movement, its representative seeking an\r\ninterview with the Standard officials as to their willingness to share\r\nin the cost of reducing the production. Here was a chance for Mr.\r\nRockefeller to apply his theory of handling the oil producers—conciliate\r\nthem when possible—encourage them in limiting their production. The oil\r\nmen’s representatives were met half-way, and an interesting and curious\r\nplan was worked out; the producers were to agree to limit their\r\nproduction by 17,500 barrels a day. They were to do this by shutting\r\ndown their producing wells a part or all of the time and by doing no\r\nfresh drilling for a year. If they would do this the Standard agreed to\r\nsell the association 5,000,000 barrels of oil at sixty-two cents, and\r\nlet them carry it at the usual rates as long as they wanted to. Whatever\r\nadvance in price came from the shut-in movement the producers were to\r\nhave on their oil, and it was to be shared by them according to the\r\namount each shut in his production. Mr. Phillips, before agreeing to\r\nthis arrangement, demanded that provision be made for the workingmen who\r\nwould be thrown out of employment by the shut-down, and he proposed that\r\nthe association set aside for their benefit 1,000,000 barrels of the oil\r\nbought from the Standard, and that the Standard set aside another\r\nmillion; all the profits above sixty-two cents and the carrying charges\r\non the 2,000,000 barrels were to go to the workingmen. A memorandum\r\ncovering the above points of the agreement was drawn up, and it was\r\naccepted by the two interests represented.[136]\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s reason for signing the contract he gave to the New\r\nYork State Trust Investigating Committee four months later:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ ... What was the inducement for the Standard Oil Trust to enter\r\n  into such an agreement as that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The inducement was for the purpose of accomplishing a\r\n  harmonious feeling as between the interests of the Standard Oil\r\n  Trust and the producers of petroleum; there was great distress\r\n  throughout the oil-producing region; as an instance of that distress\r\n  there was an outcry that our interest was getting a return, that\r\n  theirs was not in the business, and we did not know, as a matter of\r\n  fact, that the oil-producing interest was abnormally depressed, and\r\n  we felt it to be to the interests of the American oil industry that\r\n  a reasonable price should be had by the producer for the crude\r\n  material, and we wanted to co-operate to that end.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ By advancing the price of the crude material you necessarily\r\n  advance the price of the refined?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shut-down went into effect the first of November, 1887. The effect\r\non stocks and the market was immediate—stocks fell off at the rate of a\r\nmillion barrels a month, and prices rose by January, 1888, some twenty\r\ncents. But at the end of the year, though oil was higher and stocks\r\nconsiderably less, the benefits of the shut-down had not been\r\nconspicuous enough to produce that “harmonious feeling” Mr. Rockefeller\r\nso much desired; not sufficient to distract the minds of the producers\r\nfrom the idea they had in forming their association, and that was a\r\nco-operative enterprise for taking care of their own oil. Throughout\r\n1888 and 1889 two schemes, known as the Co-operative Oil Company,\r\nLimited, and the United Oil Company, Limited, were under consideration.\r\nBy the end of the latter year it looked as if something could be done\r\nwith the second, and it was turned over by the executive board of the\r\nassociation to a special committee, of which H. L. Taylor, of the Union\r\nOil Company, one of the largest and oldest producing concerns of the Oil\r\nRegions, was chairman. How Mr. Taylor had succeeded in getting into the\r\nProducers’ Protective Association it is hard to say, for it was he and\r\nhis partner, Mr. Satterfield, who in 1883 had tried to throw the\r\nTidewater Pipe Line into the hands of the Standard Oil Company, and who,\r\nwhen that unworthy scheme failed, had sold their stock to the Standard,\r\nthus giving that company its first holdings in the Tidewater.[138] The\r\nindependents had forgotten or overlooked this fact, for Taylor was a\r\nmember of the Producers’ Protective Association and prominent in its\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nThe special committee, of which Mr. Taylor was chairman, went actively\r\nto work. Lawyers were employed to consider the safest form of\r\norganisation for a company doing an interstate pipe-line business and\r\ncarrying on refineries. Certain German capitalists, owners of tank\r\nsteamers and interested in foreign marketing agencies, were brought into\r\nthe scheme. Things were going well, when suddenly the committee found\r\nthe chairman cooling toward the enterprise. Then came the rumour that\r\nMr. Taylor and his partners—Mr. Satterfield and J. L. and J. C.\r\nMcKinney—had sold the Union Oil Company to the Standard. A meeting of\r\nthe executive board was at once called, Messrs. Taylor and J. L.\r\nMcKinney both being present. They acknowledged the truth of the report\r\nand were promptly informed their resignations would be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe rumour of the secret desertion of strong members of the Producers’\r\nProtective Association, while holding positions of trust, soon spread\r\nthrough the Oil Regions. It was a staggering blow. It took from them one\r\nof the largest single interests represented. It deprived them of men of\r\nability on whom they had depended. It introduced a fear of treachery\r\nfrom others. It brought them face to face with a new and serious element\r\nin the oil problem—_the Standard as an oil producer_. Up to 1887, the\r\nyear of the organisation of the Producers’ Protective Association, Mr.\r\nRockefeller had not taken his great combination into oil production to\r\nany extent, and wisely enough from his point of view. It was a business\r\nin which there were great risks, and as long as he could control the\r\noutput by being its only buyer, why should he take them? Now, however,\r\nthe situation was changing. A number of sure fields had been\r\ndeveloped—Bradford, Ohio, West Virginia. Their value was depressed by\r\nover-production. Mr. Rockefeller had money to invest. The producers were\r\nthreatening to disturb his control by a co-operative scheme. It was\r\ncertain that he had not yet produced a “harmonious feeling.” It was not\r\nsure he would. If he failed in that they might one day even shut off his\r\nsupply of oil, as they had done in 1872, and Mr. Rockefeller, with great\r\nforesight, determined to become a producer. In 1887 he went into Ohio\r\nfields. Soon after he began quietly to buy into West Virginia. When he\r\nlearned, in 1890, from Mr. Taylor and his partners, that a co-operative\r\ncompany of producers was on foot, he naturally enough concluded that the\r\nbest way to dismember it was to buy out the largest interest in it. The\r\nUnion Oil Company saw the advantage of being a member of the Standard\r\nOil Trust, and sold. In this one year, 1890, over 40,000 shares of\r\nStandard Oil Trust certificates were issued to oil-producing\r\ncompanies,[139] as follows:\r\n\r\n       For stock of Union Oil Company              18,249 shares\r\n       For stock of Forest Oil Company             17,378   〃\r\n       For stock of North Pennsylvania Oil Company  2,647   〃\r\n       For stock of Midland Oil Company             2,000   〃\r\n                                                   ——————\r\n                                                   40,274   〃\r\n\r\nThere was general consternation in producing circles, and if there had\r\nnot been a number of men in the organisation who realised that the life\r\nof the independent effort was at stake, and who turned all their\r\nstrength to saving it, the association would undoubtedly have gone to\r\npieces. Chief among these men were Lewis Emery, Jr., and C. P. Collins,\r\nof Bradford, Pennsylvania; J. W. Lee and David Kirk, of Pittsburg; A. D.\r\nWood, of Warren; Michael Murphy, of Philadelphia; Rufus Scott, of\r\nWellsville; J. B. Aiken, of Washington; R. J. Straight, of Bradford;\r\nRoger Sherman and M. W. Quick, of Titusville. They urged an immediate\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, at which a plan for co-operative action\r\nshould be adopted and at once put into force.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1891, the General Assembly convened at Warren,\r\nPennsylvania. The whole miserable story of the co-operative plan which\r\nthe executive board had worked out, and its destruction by the desertion\r\nof the Union Oil Company, came out. It was at once evident that, instead\r\nof disheartening the Assembly, it was going to harden their\r\ndetermination and spur them to action; that they would not leave Warren\r\nuntil they had something to work on. The session lasted three days, and\r\nbefore finally adjourning it had adopted a drastic plan, framed by a\r\ncommittee of nine, of which Mr. Quick was chairman. This plan aimed, so\r\nthe resolution adopted by the Assembly stated, _to cut off the supplies\r\nof the producers’ oil from the Standard Trust!_ This was to be\r\naccomplished by forming a limited partnership, whose subscribers should\r\nall be trusted members of the Producers’ Protective Association (only\r\npersons having no affiliation with the Standard Oil Company were members\r\nof the Producers’ Protective Association, it will be remembered), and\r\nwhich should aim to take care of the crude oil from the wells of the\r\nproducers who went into the movement, furnish it local transportation,\r\nand find a market for it either by building independent refineries or by\r\nalliance with those already in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MICHAEL MURPHY\r\n\r\n  The present President of the Pure Oil Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES W.

PHILLIPS\r\n\r\n  A leader in the independent movement, which resulted in the Pure Oil\r\n    Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom Warren the delegates went home to work for the new scheme. J. W.\r\nLee and J. R. Goldsborough, the secretary of the association, at once\r\nmade a tour of the Oil Regions to explain the project and solicit\r\nsubscriptions. The response was immediate. In a few weeks over 1,000\r\nproducers had subscribed to the new company, which was at once organised\r\nas the Producers’ Oil Company, Limited, its capital being $600,000.\r\n\r\nBut it is one thing to organise a company, and another to do business.\r\nWhere were they to begin? Where to set foot? The only thing of which\r\nthey were sure was a supply of crude oil, and in order to take care of\r\nthat they began operations by putting up four iron tanks at Coraopolis,\r\nPennsylvania, near the rich McDonald oil field. But they must have a\r\nmarket for it, and their first effort was to ship it abroad. At Bayonne,\r\nNew Jersey, on the border of the territory occupied by the Standard’s\r\ngreat plant, stands an independent oil refinery, the Columbia Oil\r\nCompany. The Columbia has “terminal privileges,” that is, a place on the\r\nwater-front from which it can ship oil—an almost impossible privilege to\r\nsecure around New York harbour. The Producers’ Oil Company now obtained\r\nfrom Hugh King, the president of the Columbia, the use of his terminal.\r\nThey at once had fifty tank-cars built, and prepared to ship their crude\r\noil, but the market was against them, stocks were increasing, prices\r\ndropping. The railroad charged a price so high for running their cars\r\nthat there was no profit, and the fifty tank-cars were never used in\r\nthat trade. A futile effort to use their crude oil as fuel in Pittsburg\r\noccupied their attention for a time, but it amounted to nothing. It was\r\nbecoming clearer daily that they must refine their oil. The way opened\r\nto this toward the end of their first year.\r\n\r\nIn and around Oil City and Titusville there had grown up since 1881 a\r\nnumber of independent oil refineries. They had come into being as a\r\ndirect result of the compromise made in 1880 between the producers and\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, a clause of which stipulated that thereafter\r\nrailroad rates should be open and equal to all shippers. The\r\nPennsylvania seems to have intended at first to live up to this\r\nagreement, and it encouraged refiners in both the Oil Regions and\r\nPhiladelphia to establish works. At first things had gone very well.\r\nThere were economies in refining near the point where the oil was\r\nproduced, and so long as the young independents had a low rate to\r\nseaboard for their export oil they prospered. But in 1884 things began\r\nto change. In that year the Standard Pipe Line made a pooling\r\narrangement with the Pennsylvania Railroad, by which rates from the Oil\r\nRegions were raised to fifty-two cents a barrel, an advance of seventeen\r\ncents a barrel over what they had been getting, and in return for this\r\nraise the Standard agreed to give the railroad twenty-six per cent. of\r\nall the oil shipped Eastward, or pay them for what they did not get.\r\nThis advance put the independents at a great disadvantage. In September,\r\n1888, another advance came. Rates on oil in barrels were raised to\r\nsixty-six cents, while rates on oil in tanks were not raised. The\r\nexplanation was evident. The railroad owned no tank-cars, but rented\r\nthem from the Standard Oil Company. It refused to furnish these\r\ntank-cars to the independents, but forced them to ship in barrels, and\r\nnow advanced the price on oil in barrels. This second advance was more\r\nthan the refiners could live under, and they combined and took their\r\ncase to the Interstate Commerce Commission, a hearing being given them\r\nin Titusville in May, 1889. No decision had as yet been rendered, and\r\nthey in the meantime were having a more and more trying struggle for\r\nlife, and their exasperation against the Standard was increasing with\r\neach week. When, therefore, the representatives of the Producers’ Oil\r\nCompany proposed a league with the independent refiners they were\r\ncordially welcomed.\r\n\r\nWe have oil in tanks at Coraopolis, said the producers, plenty of it,\r\nbut we have no market. If we build a pipe-line from our tanks to Oil\r\nCity and Titusville and give you pipage at fifteen cents a barrel,\r\nfive cents less than the Standard charges, will you enter into an\r\nagreement with us to take our oil for five years? The refiners saw at\r\nonce the possible future in such an arrangement, and in a short time\r\nthey had gone individually into a company to be called the Producers’\r\nand Refiners’ Company, with a capital of $250,000, of which the\r\nProducers’ Oil Company held $160,000, and whose object was the laying\r\nof a pipe-line from the fields in which the producers were interested\r\nto the refineries at Oil City and Titusville. The new plan was carried\r\nout with the greatest secrecy and promptness. Before the Standard men\r\nin the region realised what was going on, a right of way was secured\r\nand the pipe was going down. On January 8, 1893, the first oil was\r\nrun. Here, then, was the first link in a practical co-operative\r\nenterprise—independent producers and refiners of oil joined by a\r\npipe-line of which they were the owners.\r\n\r\nWhile this enterprise was being carried out in Western Pennsylvania, in\r\nthe northern part of the state a still more ambitious, independent\r\nproject was under way, nothing less than a double pipe-line, one for\r\nrefined and the other for crude oil, from the Oil Regions to the sea.\r\nThis plan had originated with Lewis Emery, Jr., one of the most\r\nimplacable and intelligent opponents Mr. Rockefeller’s pretensions have\r\never met. Mr. Emery sympathised with the idea that there was no way for\r\nthe producer to get his share of the profits in the oil business except\r\nby handling the product entirely himself. In his judgment a pipe-line to\r\nthe seaboard was the first important link in such an attempt, and in\r\n1891, on his own responsibility, he set out to see what hopes there were\r\nof securing a right of way. The Columbia Oil Company, through whom the\r\nProducers and Refiners were exporting, favoured such a scheme. It was\r\ncertain many producers would go into it; but on all sides there was much\r\nscepticism about the Standard allowing a line to go through. Mr. Emery’s\r\nfirst idea was a line from Bradford to Williamsport, on the Reading\r\nroad. He consulted the railroad officials. They would be glad of the\r\nfreight, they told him, and a preliminary contract was drawn up. The\r\ncontract was never completed. Mr. Emery returned to find out why. “If we\r\ngive you this contract,” the Reading officials told Mr. Emery, “we shall\r\ndisturb our relations with the Standard Oil Trust. We cannot do it.”\r\n\r\nTurning from the Reading, he projected a new route, a pipe-line from\r\nBradford to the New York, Ontario and Western Railway near Hancock, New\r\nYork, thence by rail to the Hudson River, and from there by water to New\r\nYork harbour. The New York, Ontario and Western officials welcomed the\r\nproposal. It gave them a new and valuable freight. But the pipes must\r\ncross the Erie road near both its terminals. Mr. Emery saw the president\r\nof the road. “Yes,” the president told him, “we are disposed to assist\r\nall progress. Go ahead.” Thus encouraged, he sent his men into the field\r\nto get the right of way. They had made a good beginning before the\r\nproject was known, but as soon as it was rumoured there appeared\r\npromptly on the route surveyed a number of men known to be Standard\r\nemployees. They, too, wanted a right of way, the same as Mr. Emery\r\nwanted. They bought strips of land across his route, they bought up\r\nmortgages on farms where rights had already been acquired, and, mortgage\r\nin hand, compelled farmers to give them rights. It was an incessant\r\nharassing by men who never used the rights acquired—who did not want\r\nthem save to hinder the independent project. This sort of hindrance by\r\nthe Standard was certain, whatever route was taken, and Mr. Emery went\r\nahead undismayed, and in September, 1892, organised his company—the\r\nUnited States Pipe Line Company—with a capital of $600,000. Among the\r\nincorporators were representatives of the independents’ interests, both\r\nin New York and in the Oil Regions, and much of the stock was soon\r\nplaced in the hands of the men who were interested in the independent\r\nconcerns described above.\r\n\r\nIt looked very much as if the United States Pipe Line were to be laid.\r\nNow, the strength of the Standard Oil Trust had always been due to its\r\ncontrol of transportation. An independent pipe-line, especially to the\r\nseaboard, was considered rightly as a much more serious menace to its\r\npower than an independent refinery. The United States Pipe Line could\r\nnot be allowed, and prompt and drastic measures were taken to hinder its\r\nwork. There is no space here for an account of the wearisome obstructive\r\nlitigation which confronted the company, for the constant interference,\r\neven by force, which followed them for months. It culminated when an\r\nattempt was made to join the pipes laid to each side of the Erie tracks\r\nnear Hancock, New York, the Eastern terminal of the pipe-line. Mr.\r\nEmery, relying on the promise of the Erie’s president to allow a\r\ncrossing, sent his men to the railway to connect the pipes. Hardly had\r\nthey arrived before there descended on them a force of seventy-five\r\nrailroad men armed for war. These men took possession of the territory\r\nat the end of the pipes and intrenched themselves for attack. The\r\npipe-line men camped near by for three months, but they never attempted\r\nto join the pipes. Mr. Emery had concluded, on investigation, that the\r\nErie officials, like the Reading, had found that it would be unwise to\r\ndisturb their relations with the Standard, and while his men were\r\nkeeping attention fixed on that point he was executing a flank movement,\r\nsecuring a right of way from a point seventy miles back to Wilkesbarre,\r\non the Jersey Central. This new movement was executed with such celerity\r\nthat by June, 1893, the United States Pipe Line had a crude line 180\r\nmiles long connecting the Bradford oil fields with a friendly railway,\r\nand a refined line 250 miles long connecting the independent refiners of\r\nOil City, Titusville, Warren and Bradford with the same railway.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of the refined line a question of vital importance\r\nwas to be settled: Could refined oil be pumped that distance without\r\ndeteriorating? The Standard had insisted loudly that it could not. When\r\nthe day came to make the experiment an anxious set of men gathered at\r\nthe Wilkesbarre terminal. They feared particularly that the oil would\r\nlose colour, but, to their amazement, not only was the colour kept, but\r\nit was found on experiment that the fire test was actually raised by the\r\nextra agitation the oil had undergone in the long churning through the\r\npipes. A new advance had been made in the oil industry—the most\r\nsubstantial and revolutionary since the day the Tidewater demonstrated\r\nthat crude oil could be pumped over the mountains. This new discovery,\r\nit is well to note, was not the work of the Standard Oil Trust, but it\r\nwas accomplished in the face of their ridicule and opposition by men\r\ndriven to find some way to escape from their hard dealings.\r\n\r\nThe success of the United States refined line aroused the greatest\r\nenthusiasm among the independent interests. It gave them access to the\r\nseaboard, and there was immediate talk of a closer union between them.\r\nWhy should the Producers’ and Refiners’ Pipe Lines not be sold to the\r\nUnited States Line and completed to Bradford? By the spring of 1894 the\r\nproject seemed certain of realisation.\r\n\r\nThe new movement was serious. Let this consolidation take place, and the\r\nproducers had exactly what they had set out in 1887 to build up—a\r\ncomplete machine for handling the oil they produced. As the undertaking\r\ngrew in solidity and completeness, the war upon it grew more systematic\r\nand determined. It took two main lines—discrediting the enterprise in\r\nthe eyes of stockholders so that they would sell the stock to Standard\r\nbuyers, the object being, of course, to get control of the companies;\r\ncutting the refined market until the refiners in the alliance should\r\nfail, or, becoming discouraged, sell. The work of discrediting the\r\nenterprise was turned over to the Standard organs in the Oil Regions,\r\nchief among which is the Oil City Derrick. Since 1885 the editor of this\r\ninteresting sheet has been a picturesque Irishman, Patrick C. Boyle by\r\nname. Mr. Boyle’s position as editor and proprietor of the Derrick is\r\ndue to the generosity of the Standard Oil Trust, and he has discharged\r\nhis allegiance to his benefactor with a zeal which, if it has not always\r\ncontributed to the enlightenment of the Oil Regions, has, materially, to\r\nits gaiety. Mr. Boyle now turned all his extraordinary power of\r\nvituperation on three of the independents whose activity was\r\nparticularly offensive to him—Mr. Emery, Mr. Wood and Mr. Lee—and he\r\nwent so far that each of the three gentlemen finally sued him for libel.\r\nThey all got judgments. In Mr. Emery’s case, Mr. Boyle, after signing a\r\nbond of $5,000 to keep the peace—which bond he was obliged later to pay,\r\nwith half as much more in costs—published the following retraction:\r\n\r\n\r\n                             TO THE PUBLIC\r\n\r\n  For many years past there have appeared in the editorial and news\r\n  columns of the Oil City Derrick various articles reflecting on the\r\n  business, social and political character and integrity of Lewis\r\n  Emery, Jr.\r\n\r\n  P. C. Boyle, the editor of the Derrick, was indicted and convicted\r\n  for the publication of certain of such articles, and civil suit for\r\n  damages was instituted by Mr. Emery against P. C. Boyle for damages\r\n  for such publications.\r\n\r\n  The litigation has now been adjusted, and Mr. Boyle voluntarily\r\n  retracts _in toto_ all matters and things which he has said\r\n  derogatory to the character, standing, or responsibility of Lewis\r\n  Emery, Jr., published by him or under his direction in the past.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Boyle is fully satisfied that such articles have been published\r\n  under a misapprehension of the facts, and is satisfied that Mr.\r\n  Emery has been wronged, and should be vindicated, and this\r\n  retraction is freely made as such.\r\n\r\n  Many of the articles have been republished in various papers in this\r\n  country and Europe, and it is the desire of Mr. Boyle that this\r\n  retraction shall be as freely and fully printed and published as\r\n  were the original articles reflecting on Mr. Emery.\r\n\r\n                                           (Signed)       P. C. BOYLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a satisfaction to the writer to be able to help gratify Mr.\r\nBoyle’s laudable desire to have this document well circulated!\r\n\r\nAlthough the greater part of the Oil Regions never took Mr. Boyle\r\nhimself seriously, the conviction that his attacks were inspired, that\r\nthis was the Standard’s way of saying to the producers that their\r\nenterprise would not be allowed to live, gave a sinister look to what he\r\nsaid. More damaging still was the quiet confidence with which the solid\r\nmen of the Standard smiled at the independent effort. What were their\r\npuny hundreds compared to the millions of the trust? What was a band of\r\nscattered “oil-shriekers” against the cold-blooded deliberation of Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s solid phalanx? The oil men were conscious enough of the\r\ninadequacy of their capital and their organisation, but they hung on,\r\nmany of them because their blood was up, and they preferred spending\r\ntheir last cent to yielding; others on the principle which Mr. Phillips\r\nconfesses held him, “that God sometimes chooses the weak things of the\r\nworld to confound the mighty”; or that “one might chase a thousand, and\r\ntwo put ten thousand to flight.”\r\n\r\nThe efforts which the Standard made to discredit the independent\r\ncompanies and their leaders were accompanied by a persistent, though\r\nquiet, attempt of Standard agents to buy in all the stock in the\r\nProducers’ Oil Company and the United States Pipe Lines which timid,\r\nindifferent, or financially embarrassed stockholders could be induced to\r\ngive up. The movement began to be rumoured and caused no little\r\nuneasiness in independent circles. How much would the Standard get? What\r\nwould they do with it? They were soon to find out.\r\n\r\nBefore the use to be made of the stock developed, however, the Standard\r\nturned against the independents the most powerful and cruel weapon it\r\nwields—its control of the markets. The refiners were to be driven from\r\nthe combination. The extent to which cutting was carried on for two\r\nyears, beginning with the fall of 1893, is clear from a comparison of\r\nprices. In January of 1893 crude oil was selling at 53½ cents a barrel\r\nand refined oil for export at 5.33 cents a gallon. Throughout the year\r\nthe price of crude advanced until in December it was 78⅜ cents. Refined,\r\non the contrary, fell, and it was actually eighteen points lower in\r\nDecember than it had been twelve months before. Throughout 1894 the\r\nStandard kept refined oil down; the average price of the year was 5.19\r\ncents a gallon, in face of the average crude market of 83¾\r\ncents[140]—lower than in January, 1893, with crude at 53½ cents a\r\nbarrel!\r\n\r\nThis much for the New York end of the export business. In Germany, where\r\nthe export oil of the independents all went, it being handled there by\r\none dealer, Herr Poth, whose depot was Mannheim, on the Rhine, prices\r\nwere cut at every point which the independent oil reached. It was a\r\nmatter of life and death to keep the foreign market they had developed,\r\nand for twenty months the independent refiners met the demand of their\r\nexport agents and foreign dealers for lower prices with cut cargoes. For\r\ntwenty months they lost money on every barrel they sold. Oil was sold by\r\nthe Titusville refiners as low as 1.98 cents a gallon. The Lewis Emery\r\nworks at Bradford sold one cargo at 1.07 cents net, and many at or below\r\ntwo cents. Had it not been for the union with pipe-lines such prices\r\nwould have been impossible, but all through the struggle in the market\r\nthe United States Pipe Line and the Producers’ and Refiners’ lines\r\ncarried oil at cost or below. The pipe-lines were heavily in debt to the\r\nReading Iron Works, but that company stood by them valiantly, extending\r\ntheir notes until the struggle was over and the pipe-lines able to meet\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation could not go on forever, evidently. It had come\r\napparently to be a question of how long the refiner had money to lose,\r\nand, as month after month the independents saw their bank accounts\r\ndiminishing, and no relief in sight, the courage of a few began to ooze.\r\nFinally, late in 1894, a committee of the Western refiners, consisting\r\nof John Fertig of Titusville, H. P. Burwald of Titusville and S. W.\r\nRamage of Oil City, went to New York to consult the Standard. Is there\r\nno hope of a better market? Is there any chance for us? None whatever,\r\nthey were told, except to sell. We will buy the refineries and the stock\r\nof the independent concerns, but that is all we can do. The committee\r\ncame home to report. The situation was hopeless, they said, and, as for\r\nthem, they should sell. As they represented three of the largest\r\nconcerns in the Union, and all carried stock in the allied enterprises,\r\ntheir withdrawal seemed at the moment a death-blow. It was a glum and\r\nbeaten body of men which listened to the report, surrender written in\r\nevery line of their faces.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Lee and Mr. Wood, two active men of the Producers Oil Company,\r\nhad been invited to the meeting of the refiners. They realised fully\r\nthat if the refiners pulled out of the Union now, the independent effort\r\nwould in all probability go to pieces, and before a vote to sell could\r\nbe taken Mr. Lee was on his feet. In an impassioned speech he pleaded\r\nfor one more effort. He pointed out the fact that the abnormal condition\r\nof the oil market could not remain, that crude oil was steadily rising,\r\nand that no monopoly could permanently hold down a manufactured product\r\nin the face of the rising raw product. The Standard had done this for\r\nnearly two years—but it was contrary to the laws of nature that they do\r\nit for two years more. He told them that already conditions were better\r\nin Germany; that Mr. Emery had recently gone with Herr Poth, their\r\nforeign buyer, to several members of the German government, and\r\npresented to them the discrimination in prices of oil practised in the\r\nempire, oil from one and a half to three cents higher on the Elbe than\r\non the Rhine, at points where freights were the same. He told the\r\nrefiners of the interest that had been taken by the government in their\r\ncase, and how they said, “Go home, gentlemen, and this shall stop,” and\r\nthat it had stopped. If criminal underselling can be checked in Germany,\r\nMr. Lee argued, we can keep our market. He reminded the refiners that it\r\nwas not merely a business they were establishing; it was a cause they\r\nwere defending—the right of men to work in their own way without\r\nunlawful interference. The honour not only of themselves but of the Oil\r\nRegions was at stake. They were struggling for great principles. They\r\nwere demonstrating that pluck, patience, and energy and brains can\r\nconquer any combination that ability and unscrupulousness can devise.\r\n“Do not give in,” pleaded Mr. Lee. “Hold on, and we will go to the\r\nproducers, lay your plight before them, and raise money to keep up the\r\nfight.”\r\n\r\nAroused by his plea, all of the refiners, excepting Messrs. Fertig,\r\nBurwald and Ramage, who had seen the Standard, decided to make another\r\neffort if the producers would help them out. In the next few days the\r\nleading men of the independent alliance worked with fury to call the Oil\r\nRegions into a mass-meeting. They travelled from assembly to assembly\r\nexhorting to action; they circulated dodgers announcing the gathering,\r\nand finally, in January, 1895, ran special trains to Butler, the\r\nrallying place. There was no lack of enthusiasm and blunt talk at the\r\nButler mass-meeting. All the bitterness and determination of the region\r\npoured forth against the Standard, and when a resolution was offered by\r\nDavid Kirk, one of the most active and forceful of the independents, to\r\nraise money to form a new company, to be called the Pure Oil Company,\r\nits immediate object being to take care of the refiners in the tight\r\nplace where they were, it went through with a whoop, and in a few\r\nmoments $75,000 had been subscribed. A few days later this sum was\r\nraised to $200,000.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the company, as set forth in its prospectus issued at\r\nthis time, were:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To maintain and uphold the inherent right to do business, the right\r\n  to transport and market the producer’s own product, and his right to\r\n  the just reward of his labour and capital invested.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother clause of the prospectus is interesting:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To prevent any interference of that monopoly which has obtained\r\n  control of the oil business, the voting power of one-half of the\r\n  stock of the Pure Oil Company is placed by the owners in the hands\r\n  of five champions of this right of independence, who are bound by\r\n  the terms of a permanent trust bond to vote only for such men and\r\n  measures as shall forever make this company INDEPENDENT, so that no\r\n  sales of interest will carry with them any power to jeopardise the\r\n  policy or existence of the company, or the investments of its\r\n  remaining members.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pure Oil Company had been organised none too soon. It was but a few\r\nmonths after it was well under way before a hurried meeting of the\r\nindependents was called in New York. With scared faces the members\r\nlearned that the German dealer, who for four years had been handling\r\nninety per cent. of their export oil, had sold to the Standard marketing\r\nconcern, the Deutsche-Amerikanische Company. Consternation was great.\r\nThe independents had depended on the loyalty of Herr Poth as they did on\r\nthat of each other. He had been enlisted in their cause by Mr. Emery,\r\nwho, with the tragic earnestness which had characterised his entire\r\nstruggle for independence, had asked him for an oath of loyalty, and,\r\nhand on his heart, Herr Poth had pledged his faith. In every respect he\r\nhad served them loyally. His desertion was inexplicable and\r\ndisheartening. Later they learned the truth, that Herr Poth had been\r\ninformed, by what he supposed to be reliable authority, that the\r\nAmerican independent interests had sold to the Standard. Believing that\r\nthis would cut off his supply, he had turned over his concern to the\r\nDeutsche-Amerikanische. A few weeks later Herr Poth died suddenly. The\r\nstory goes in independent circles that when he learned the truth he\r\nliterally died of grief, believing he had perjured himself.\r\n\r\nHerr Poth’s sale left the independents in serious shape. They had\r\ncargoes of oil ready for Europe and no tankage in Europe to take\r\nit—nobody there to sell it. A meeting was at once called in Pittsburg to\r\nraise money, and in a few days Mr. Emery and Mr. Murphy went abroad,\r\nand, as quickly as such work could be done, they secured privileges in\r\nHamburg and Rotterdam to erect tanks and establish marketing stations.\r\nThe Pure Oil Company was in Europe. Once more the independents had been\r\ndriven to depend on themselves, and once more they had proved sufficient\r\nto the emergency. But war was by no means over. With the establishment\r\nof the Pure Oil Company came the foreshadowing of a still closer union\r\nof the companies. At all hazards this was to be prevented. The Standard\r\ndetermined to play the stock of the Producers’ Oil Company, Limited, and\r\nthe United States Pipe Line, which it had been picking up quietly.\r\n\r\nAlready one attempt had been made to get into the former concern through\r\none of the most conspicuous and successful producers of the oil\r\ncountry—Colonel John J. Carter, of Titusville, the president of the\r\nCarter Oil Company. Colonel Carter owned 300 shares of the stock of the\r\nProducers’ Oil Company, Limited, and had been elected a member on it;\r\naccording to the rules governing limited partnership in Pennsylvania, a\r\nstockholder must be elected to membership before he can vote his stock.\r\nIn February, 1894, when a union of the pipe-lines had first been voted,\r\nhe suddenly appeared in court and got an injunction against the sale. In\r\nthe hearings on the injunction there came out a fact in regard to\r\nColonel Carter which aroused a storm of wrath against him among the\r\nindependents. The Standard Oil Company owned sixty per cent. of the\r\nCarter Oil Company! A harder fact was to be digested. On April 11, 1894,\r\nthe company met in Warren, Pennsylvania. Colonel Carter was present and\r\nvoted not only his 300 shares, but 13,013 more! Where had he got them?\r\nThere was but one conclusion, and it proved to be true—the 13,013\r\nbelonged to the Standard Oil Company. They had been _loaned_ to Mr.\r\nCarter; there was a form of transfer, but no sale, not even a price\r\nhaving been decided on—evidently in the hope that he, with a few other\r\nstockholders who were disaffected, would control the meeting and prevent\r\nthe union of the pipe-lines. The attempt failed, for the Carter-Standard\r\nfaction succeeded in getting together only 21,848 shares, while the\r\nindependents held 30,560. The bitterness over this attack aroused\r\nterrible excitement. More than one member of the Warren meeting shouted\r\n“traitor” at Colonel Carter, and when the news of what happened reached\r\nthe Producers’ Protective Association there was a general demand that he\r\nbe expelled from the Titusville assembly. It was done promptly, Mr.\r\nCarter not being given even a hearing.\r\n\r\nThe Standard took back its 13,013 shares and patiently went on picking\r\nup more. By January, 1896, they held 29,764 shares, enough, with Colonel\r\nCarter’s 300, to give them a clean majority. Colonel Carter appeared at\r\n26 Broadway at this opportune moment and offered to buy the stock at\r\n100. Mr. Archbold and his colleagues thought it worth 150. (They are\r\nsaid to have paid as high as 220 for some of it.) Mr. Carter, in his\r\nfrank colloquial testimony when on the witness-stand, described the\r\nconversation over the price:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Archbold says, ‘I don’t know, John, but what you are asking us\r\n  to sell that stock too cheap. Don’t you think it is worth more\r\n  money?’ I says, ‘Not to me, it is not.’ I says, ‘I am willing to\r\n  start in on this thing and put it on a paying basis and pay par for\r\n  it.’ ‘Well,’ he says, ‘I guess that we will have to think that thing\r\n  over,’ and it dropped right there.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were several interviews between Mr. Archbold, Mr. Rogers and Mr.\r\nCarter. They wanted to know how he proposed to run the Producers’ Oil\r\nCompany if he obtained a majority of the stock. “If I run that\r\npipe-line,” Mr. Carter reports himself as saying, “I am going to run it\r\naccording to law and business principles. Any man that wants oil of me,\r\nand has the money to pay for it, shall have it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you let Mr. Emery have some oil if he wants it?” asked Mr. Rogers.\r\n“Yes, I will.” “And all the outside refiners?” “Yes, I will. I shall\r\nmake no discrimination against the outside refiner and in favour of the\r\nStandard Oil Company, or _vice versa_.”\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil seems to have been convinced that Colonel Carter was\r\ntheir friend—they probably never had any doubt of their ability to\r\nmanage _him_, and it is evident from the Colonel’s testimony that _he_\r\nnever had any doubt about his own ability to manage both independents\r\nand Standard—and the sale was made at 100, Colonel Carter giving his\r\ncheck for $297,640 on the Seaboard Bank.\r\n\r\nStock in hand, Colonel Carter went back to the Oil Regions to take\r\npossession. It was not so easy as he anticipated. The secretary refused\r\nto transfer the stock. He sought the president, Mr. Lee. What took place\r\nColonel Carter himself told later on the witness-stand:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Senator Lee and myself retired to my room in the hotel and we had\r\n  quite a preliminary conversation on the situation and in regard to\r\n  the Producers’ Pipe Line. Then I stated to him my ownership of the\r\n  majority of the stock of the Producers’ Oil Company, Limited, and\r\n  stated furthermore that I purchased it from the National Transit\r\n  Company; that my desire was to stop all contention on the part of\r\n  the producers and myself, to run the business on a business\r\n  principle, so that the stock belonging to the various members and\r\n  myself might pay something, instead of dragging its slow length\r\n  along as it had been for the past six years. I told him,\r\n  furthermore, that I was perfectly willing that he should elect what\r\n  portion of the directors that his stock would warrant him, and I\r\n  would elect those that I could. The Senator replied then: ‘You\r\n  propose to take charge of the association?’ ‘Yes,’ I said; ‘I did.’\r\n  The Senator then stated emphatically that I could not do it; he\r\n  would not permit it; if he had to spend the whole capital of the\r\n  company he would resist it.... He gave me to understand emphatically\r\n  that there was not anything except the management of the company by\r\n  himself and his associates that would be tolerated, and I told him\r\n  then I was sorry that I would have to go into court and determine my\r\n  rights in court. That was about all, but it is only fair,\r\n  furthermore, to say that at the time the Senator was rather warm,\r\n  and I presume I was warm in the collar myself. I stated to him\r\n  plainly that if there was any attempt to eject me from a legally\r\n  constituted meeting in which I was there, I would resist it if I\r\n  killed the man that attempted to put me out.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Carter’s cool announcement that he meant to run the company “from a\r\nbusiness stand-point, and not from the stand-point of a gadfly”—there\r\nseems to be a doubt about its being the producers who had played the\r\npart of the gadfly—exasperated the independents to the last degree, and\r\nin June, 1896, they met the colonel in court. His ownership of a\r\nmajority of the company’s stock was admitted, but it was urged by the\r\nindependents that the Producers’ Oil Company was a limited partnership,\r\nand that under the Pennsylvania law no one owning stock can become a\r\nmember without being elected by a majority in number and value of the\r\ninterests. Colonel Carter had been elected member on only 300 shares.\r\nBoth the lower and supreme courts sustained the independents, and\r\nColonel Carter found himself an owner of a majority of the concern’s\r\nstock without the right of control. Under those circumstances neither he\r\nnor the Standard wanted the stock, and the company bought it below par.\r\n\r\nThe winning of the Carter case gave encouragement that a similar suit\r\nbrought by the Standard pipe-lines against the United States Pipe Line\r\nmight fail. As already noted, the Standard began to buy into that\r\ncompany as soon as it was under way, and by the summer of 1895 they had\r\ncollected 2,613 shares. In August of that year the annual meeting of the\r\ncompany was held, and the agent of the Standard Oil Company who had been\r\nbuying the stock, J. C. McDowell, presented himself prepared to vote. He\r\nwas stopped at the door by Michael Murphy, the present president of the\r\nPure Oil Company, and told emphatically that they considered that he was\r\nsent there by the Standard Oil Company to spy on their actions; that,\r\nlegal or illegal, they would throw him out if he crossed the threshold.\r\nMr. Murphy is well known to be a man of his word, and as he was backed\r\nby young and athletic independent stockholders, Mr. McDowell discreetly\r\nwithdrew. Naturally a suit followed, but this time the independents\r\nlost. The United States Pipe Line, being a corporation, was obliged to\r\nrecognise the Standard interest in the concern and eventually to allow\r\nthem a director on its board.\r\n\r\nThe humiliation and disgust over this result shook the independents’\r\ninterests to their foundation. There perhaps was never a period of more\r\nheart-breaking discouragement for many of the men than when they saw\r\ntheir dearest hopes frustrated, and a Standard representative in their\r\ncouncils. This defeat came, too, when they were smarting under a\r\ncontinued and intolerable interference by the Standard with the\r\nextension of their pipe-lines to the seaboard. That both the crude and\r\nrefined lines should ultimately reach the sea had, of course, been the\r\nintention from the first. But it was not until 1895 that the company\r\nfelt firm enough in its finances to push the extension. The route laid\r\nout was from Wilkesbarre to Bayonne, New Jersey, by way of Hampton\r\nJunction, on the Jersey Central Railroad. By this course two railroads\r\nwere to be crossed, the Pennsylvania and the Delaware, Lackawanna and\r\nWestern. Under both of them ran the pipe-lines of the Standard and the\r\nTidewater, and the United States Pipe Line officials believed they had\r\nan equal right to go under, but they took it for granted they would be\r\nopposed, and prepared for it. Looking over the titles of the land along\r\nthe Pennsylvania, Mr. Emery, the president of the company, who was\r\npersonally directing the extension, found one for an acre; the owner did\r\nnot know of his possession and was glad to sell it. This gave the United\r\nStates people a crossing, but even then they were obliged to carry on a\r\nlong litigation in the courts before they were free to use their right.\r\n\r\nComing to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, they decided to test\r\ntheir position by laying a pipe. It was promptly torn out. A farm over\r\nwhich the railroad passed was then purchased and preparations made to\r\nlay the pipe in a roadway under the tracks. As this road was some\r\nseventeen feet below the rails, any claim that there was possible danger\r\nfrom the oil seemed feeble. Knowing that the point was watched, Mr.\r\nEmery tried strategy. Taking fifty men with him he went in the night to\r\nthe culvert under which he meant to cross, laid his pipes four feet\r\nunder ground, fastened them down with heavy timbers, piled rocks on\r\nthem, anchored them with chains, established a camp on each side of the\r\ntrack, and prepared for war. They soon had it. First, with a body of\r\nrailroad men armed with picks and bars, who invaded the camp. “I told\r\nthe boys,” said Mr. Emery in describing the incident to the Industrial\r\nCommission in 1899, “to take the men by the shoulders and the seat of\r\nthe pants, and take them out and lay them down carefully, which they\r\ndid.” The next day two wrecking-cars, with 250 men, came down the road\r\nand charged the camp, but again they were routed. The matter was taken\r\nby mutual agreement into court, and while Mr. Emery was before the\r\njustice of the peace, two locomotives were run down and the camp\r\nattacked with hot water and coals!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAYING A SIX-INCH PIPE LINE, CAIRO, WEST VIRGINIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy this time the whole countryside was aroused. The unfairness of the\r\nthing was so patent that even the railroad employees engaged in it did\r\nnot hesitate to say, in excuse of their employers, that it was the\r\nStandard Oil Company which was at the bottom of the opposition! As for\r\nthe inhabitants, they offered any aid they could give. The local G. A.\r\nR. sent forty-eight muskets to the scene of war. Mr. Emery bought\r\neighteen Springfield rifles, the camp was barricaded, and for seven\r\nmonths the pipes were guarded while the courts were deciding the legal\r\ntitle to the crossing.\r\n\r\nThis interim was employed by the pipe-line people in an attempt to get a\r\nfree pipe-line bill through the New Jersey Legislature. If this could be\r\ndone they could go under the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western without\r\nits consent. The bill was introduced in February, 1896, J. W. Lee, Hugh\r\nKing and Lewis Emery, Jr., all appearing before the committee to argue\r\nfor it. At first there seemed to be no opposition to it. Everybody\r\nagreed it was a just and proper measure. Then, suddenly, within a few\r\ndays of the end of the session, a violent opposition sprang up. Trenton\r\nbecame alive with lobbyists—men well enough known to politicians. The\r\nnewspapers came out boldly with the charge that the railroads and\r\nStandard were going to defeat the bill. Its friends could not believe\r\nit, nor did they until they found, the morning it was to be presented,\r\nthat the Senator having it in charge had disappeared, taking with him\r\nthe bill and everything concerning it. Four days later the Legislature\r\nadjourned, and the precious Senator, when next heard from, was in the\r\nfar West!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRUNK AND LOCAL PIPE LINES OF THE PURE OIL COMPANY.\r\n\r\n  There are two lines from Oil City to Marcus Hook, near Philadelphia,\r\n    one for crude and one for refined oil.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDeprived of this hope, and condemned to a litigation which was certain\r\nto be made as long, as vexatious, and as costly as lawyers could make\r\nit, the chief counsel of the United States Pipe Line, Roger Sherman,\r\nadvised a bold move—to bring suit against the Standard Trust under the\r\nSherman anti-trust law. The summons was issued in July, 1897, by John\r\nCunneen, of Buffalo. A very pretty list of wrongs it was of which the\r\nplaintiff complained: the instigation of lawsuits and the causing of\r\ninjunctions without cause, and solely for the purpose of preventing the\r\nindependent line from doing business; the publishing of libellous matter\r\nconcerning the company and its officers in newspapers controlled by the\r\ntrust; engaging bodies of men to tear up parts of pipe-line already\r\nlaid; enticing away from the enterprise officers, agents and employees;\r\nchartering or purchasing any vessels carrying independent oil, solely\r\nfor the purpose of interfering with the independent market; intimidating\r\nmerchants by threats of underselling until they refused to buy the oil\r\ncontracted for; criminal underselling solely for destroying the\r\nplaintiff’s markets.\r\n\r\nIt was a serious case Mr. Sherman made out, and the evidence he\r\ncollected was elaborate and detailed. But, for a sad reason, it was\r\nnever to come to trial. Less than two months after the summons was\r\nissued Mr. Sherman died suddenly in New York City. The shock of his\r\ndeath was such that the independent companies had no heart for the suit,\r\nbut allowed it to lapse.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing now but the slow course of Jersey justice for the\r\nUnited States Pipe Line, and for four long years it dragged itself\r\nthrough the courts. Twice it won, but at last, in 1899, decisions of the\r\nlower courts were reversed and the pipe-line had to come up. Ordered out\r\nof New Jersey, the independents had to turn back to Pennsylvania. In\r\nthat state there is a free pipe-line bill. Philadelphia is a shipping\r\npoint. Luckily for the company, Mr. Murphy had, some time before this,\r\nand in anticipation of a defeat in New Jersey, bought on his own\r\nresponsibility the land for a terminal at Marcus Hook, on the Delaware.\r\nThis terminal he now sold to the company at the nominal price he had\r\npaid for it, and the United States Pipe Line was started again from\r\nWilkesbarre to the sea. Finally, on May 2, 1901, after nine years of\r\nstruggle in the face of an interference intolerable and unjust, after a\r\nquarter of a million dollars spent in litigation, in useless surveys, in\r\nlaying and pulling up pipes, in loss of business, the first refined oil\r\never piped from the Oil Regions to the seaboard reached Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMr. Emery, in telling his story of the difficulties of the United Pipe\r\nLine to the Industrial Commission in 1899, did not hesitate to attribute\r\nthem to the Standard Oil Trust. John D. Archbold made a “general\r\ndenial”: “We have not at any time had any different relations with\r\nreference to any obstruction or effort at obstruction of their line\r\n_than would attach to any competitor in a line of business engaging\r\nagainst another_.”[141] “We asked our friends on the railroad and in the\r\nNew Jersey Legislature to look after our interests, of course,” a\r\nStandard official told the writer in discussing this case. “That was our\r\nright.” Mr. Boyle, the editor of the Derrick, took the stand before the\r\nIndustrial Commission that the Standard Oil Trust’s opposition to the\r\nUnited States Pipe Line was merely fair competition, as justifiable as\r\noffering a higher price for land which your competitor is after.\r\n\r\nFrom the Standard point of view it is evident that all this is\r\nlegitimate business. They do not wish the United States Pipe Line to\r\nreach New York. They say to their friends of the Delaware, Lackawanna\r\nand Western, and in the Legislature of New Jersey: “These people are our\r\ncompetitors.” Apparently neither the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western\r\nnor the New Jersey Legislature can afford to forget who are the\r\ncompetitors of the Standard Oil Trust. When the case becomes public and\r\nclamour is raised against such methods, the Standard disclaims all\r\nresponsibility. It was the railroad who fought the pipe-line!\r\n\r\nIt was not only from without that trouble came upon these men. There\r\nwere the inevitable internal struggles. They saw their stockholders\r\ndiminish from discontent and timidity. One of their staunchest members\r\nwithdrew because of his disbelief in the wisdom of a majority action,\r\nand twice they were robbed by death of their most valued members. In\r\nDecember, 1895, A. D. Wood, of Warren, died. Mr. Wood had been one of\r\nthe most inspiring members in the independent work, and there was nobody\r\nleft who could do what he had been doing there. In 1897 the chief\r\ncounsel, Roger Sherman, died. He had conducted the enormous and\r\nvexatious litigation of the various concerns with consummate skill, and\r\nthere was nobody to take his place. Mr. Emery, overwhelmed by the death\r\nof Roger Sherman and worn out by his six years of work and worry over\r\nthe United States Pipe Line, fell ill and was obliged to resign. On\r\nevery side it was fight and loss and despair, and yet these men hardened\r\nunder it. Not only hardened, they expanded. Ten years after the\r\nunorganised uprising which brought them together in 1887 and forced from\r\nthem the resolution to take care of their own product, what had they? A\r\ncompany of nearly 600 individual oil producers organised on a business\r\nbasis, and connected by pipe-lines with some dozen individual oil\r\nrefineries. For transporting this oil they had pipe-lines carrying both\r\ncrude and refined from the Oil Regions to within fifty miles of the sea,\r\nand for markets they had those they had themselves worked up in the\r\nUnited States and Europe. They had something more. In spite of the\r\ncontinued hostility of the Standard they had the conviction that there\r\nwas a future for their venture; but they saw clearly that to realise it\r\nthey must get themselves into still more compact form—that their\r\nholdings must be put into the hands of trustees in a single company if\r\nthey were to be free from the danger of the eventual dominance of the\r\nStandard. Now, in November, 1895, as we have seen, the independents had\r\nincorporated in New Jersey a marketing concern called the Pure Oil\r\nCompany. After months of discussion it was decided to enlarge the\r\ncapital of this company to $10,000,000, $2,000,000 in preferred and\r\n$8,000,000 in common stock, and put into this concern all their\r\ninterests. There was opposition to the consolidation from some of the\r\nstrongest interests concerned, but finally the idea prevailed, and in\r\n1900 a majority of the stock of the Producers’ Oil Company, the\r\nProducers’ and Refiners’ Company, and the United States Pipe Line was\r\nturned over to the Pure Oil Company.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the combination was frankly stated to be the maintenance\r\nof the independence of the company. This was to be effected in the\r\nfollowing way: the holders of 16,000 shares of stock—more than a\r\nmajority—vested the voting power of these shares in fifteen persons for\r\ntwenty years, and it was agreed that one-half of all shares thereafter\r\nsubscribed should be transferred to those same trustees. Shares can be\r\nsold and transferred, but this transfer does not give the purchaser any\r\nright other than provided in the trust agreement. Any trustee may be\r\nsummarily removed by three-fifths of the trustees, together with\r\nthree-fifths of the shareholders in trust. It certainly looks as if the\r\nPure Oil Company has devised an organisation which will effectually\r\npreserve its independence so long as its shareholders desire that\r\nindependence. Mr. Archbold, in describing this voting trust of the Pure\r\nOil Company to the Industrial Commission, called it “iniquitous.” It is\r\ndifficult to understand just how it is iniquitous, unless it is because\r\nof its success so far in keeping the Standard out of its councils. It is\r\nnot a secret arrangement. It aims at no monopoly, at no restraint of\r\ntrade. It claims only to be a device for protecting its obvious right to\r\nhandle its own product. Of course, if we admit that the oil business\r\nbelongs to the Standard, as Mr. Rockefeller claims, then the Pure Oil\r\nCompany is certainly in the wrong!\r\n\r\nAs it stands to-day, the independents have a good showing for their\r\nfight. They have fully 900 stockholders, most of them producers. They\r\nhandle a daily production of 8,000 barrels of crude oil; operate 1,500\r\nmiles of crude pipe-line and 400 miles of refined; are allied with some\r\nfourteen refineries, in some of which all the by-products of oil, as\r\nwell as naphtha and illuminating oils, are produced; own one\r\ntank-steamer, the Pennoil, with a capacity of 42,000 fifty-gallon\r\nbarrels, and charter several others; own oil barges on the Rhine, the\r\nElbe and the Baltic; have fully equipped stations in Europe at Hamburg,\r\nMannheim, Riesa, Stettin and Dusseldorf, in Germany; Rotterdam and\r\nAmsterdam, Holland; London and Manchester, England; and, in the United\r\nStates, New York and Philadelphia. With conservative and loyal\r\nmanagement, there seems to be no reason that the Pure Oil Company should\r\nnot become a permanent independent factor in the oil business. Such a\r\nthing is worth the best efforts of the men who have made it. Their\r\ncourageous and persistent struggle no doubt seems to most of them as of\r\npurely personal and local meaning. All they asked was to get a fair\r\nshare of the profits in their business. They knew they did not get it,\r\nand they believed it was because there was not fair play on the part of\r\nthe railroads and the Standard Oil Company. Aroused, they each fought\r\nfor the particular thing which would give them relief. They only\r\ncombined because driven to. They have become a strong organisation\r\nalmost solely because of the persistent opposition of the Standard Oil\r\nTrust. The Standard’s efforts to break up the Producers’ Protective\r\nAssociation by buying out the biggest producers precipitated a\r\nco-operative company for handling oil. Its efforts to drive out the\r\nindependent refineries by the manipulation of the railroads drove the\r\nproducers and refiners to combine. The heavy charges for handling oil by\r\nthe Standard pipe-line and by the railways drove these independents to\r\nbuild a seaboard pipe-line for both refined and crude, and to\r\ndemonstrate that refined as well as crude could be pumped to the sea in\r\npipes. The buying out of their foreign agents forced them to develop\r\ntheir own market in Europe. The secret buying in of their stock, and the\r\ncombined effort to force the Standard directors on them, compelled them\r\ninto their present close trust organisation. It looks very much as if in\r\ntrying to make way with several small scattered bodies Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhad made one strong, united one.\r\n\r\nBut while the experience of the Pure Oil Company demonstrates that it is\r\npossible to-day to build up an independent oil business if men have the\r\nrequisite patience and fighting quality, it by no means follows that the\r\nsuccess of the Pure Oil Company has restored competition in the oil\r\nbusiness or that by its success the public is getting any marked\r\nreduction in the price of oil. That the control of that price—within\r\nlimits—is now and has been almost constantly since 1876 in the hands of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company is demonstrated, the writer believes, by the\r\nfigures and diagrams of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n                            THE PRICE OF OIL\r\n\r\n  EARLIEST DESIGNS FOR CONSOLIDATION INCLUDE PLANS TO HOLD UP THE\r\n    PRICE OF OIL—SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY SO INTENDS—COMBINATION OF\r\n    1872–1873 MAKES OIL DEAR—SCHEME FAILS AND PRICES DROP—THE\r\n    STANDARD’S GREAT PROFITS IN 1876–1877 THROUGH ITS SECOND\r\n    SUCCESSFUL CONSOLIDATION—RETURN OF COMPETITION AND LOWER\r\n    PRICES—STANDARD’S FUTILE ATTEMPT IN 1880 TO REPEAT RAID OF\r\n    1876–1877—STANDARD IS CONVINCED THAT MAKING OIL TOO DEAR WEAKENS\r\n    MARKETS AND STIMULATES COMPETITION—GREAT PROFITS OF\r\n    1879–1889—LOWERING OF THE MARGIN ON EXPORT SINCE 1889 BY REASON\r\n    OF COMPETITION—MANIPULATION OF DOMESTIC PRICES EVEN MORE\r\n    MARKED—HOME CONSUMERS PAY COST OF STANDARD’S FIGHTS IN FOREIGN\r\n    LANDS—STANDARD’S VARIOUS PRICES FOR THE SAME GOODS AT HOME—HIGH\r\n    PRICES WHERE THERE IS NO COMPETITION AND LOW PRICES WHERE THERE\r\n    IS COMPETITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that in keeping the attention fixed so long on Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s oil campaign the reader has forgotten the reason why it\r\nwas undertaken. The reason was made clear enough at the start by Mr.\r\nRockefeller himself. He and his colleagues went into their first\r\nventure, the South Improvement Company, not simply because it was a\r\nquick and effective way of putting everybody but themselves out of the\r\nrefining business, but because, everybody but themselves being put out,\r\nthey could control the output of oil and put up its price. “There is no\r\nman in this country who would not quietly and calmly say that we ought\r\nto have a better price for these goods,” the secretary of the South\r\nImprovement Company told the Congressional Committee which examined him\r\nwhen it objected to a combination for raising prices.\r\n\r\nFour years after the failure of the first great scheme, a similar one\r\nwent into effect. What was its object? J. J. Vandergrift, one of the\r\ndirectors of the Standard Oil Company at that time, questioned once\r\nunder oath as to what they meant to do, said: “Simply to hold up the\r\nprice of oil—to get all we can for it.” Nobody pretended anything else\r\nat the time. “The refiners and shippers who are in the association\r\nintend there shall be no competition.” “It is a struggle for a margin.”\r\n“The scope of the association is an attempt to control the refining of\r\noil, with the ultimate purpose of advancing its price and reaping a rich\r\nharvest in profits.” These are some of the comments of the contemporary\r\npress. The published interviews with the leaders confirm these opinions.\r\nMr. Rockefeller, always discreet in his remarks, denied that the scheme\r\nwas to make a “corner” in oil; it was “to protect the oil capital\r\nagainst speculation and to regulate prices.” H. H. Rogers was more\r\nexplicit: “The price of oil to-day is fifteen cents per gallon” (March,\r\n1875). “The proposed allotment of business would probably advance the\r\nprice to twenty cents.... Oil to yield a fair profit should be sold for\r\ntwenty-five cents per gallon.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the exact status of this refining business out of which it was\r\nnecessary to make more in the year 1871, when the first scheme to\r\ncontrol it was hatched? The simplest and safest way to study this\r\nquestion is by means of the chart of prices on pages 194 and 195.[142]\r\nOn this chart the line A shows the variation in the average monthly\r\nprice, per gallon, of export oil in barrels in New York from 1866 to\r\nJune 1, 1904. The line B shows the average monthly price, per gallon, of\r\ncrude oil in bulk at the wells. A glance at the chart will show the\r\ndifference or margin between the two prices. It is out of this\r\ndifference that the refiner must pay the cost of transporting,\r\nmanufacturing, barrelling and marketing his product, and get his\r\nprofits. Now in 1866, the year after Mr. Rockefeller first went into\r\nbusiness, he had, as this chart shows, an average annual difference of\r\n35 cents a gallon between what he paid for his oil and what he sold it\r\nfor. In 1867 he had from 26½ to 20 cents; in 1868, from 20 to 22½; in\r\n1869, from 21 to 18; in 1870, from 20 to 15.[143]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHART SHOWING PRICE OF OIL FROM 1866 TO 1904.\r\n\r\n  The above chart is adapted from one published in the Report of the\r\n    Industrial Commission, Volume 1, 1900, and is brought up to date.\r\n    The figures at the right and left stand for the price per gallon in\r\n    cents. The dates are placed at the top. The figures on which the\r\n    export and crude lines are based are those taken from the “Oil City\r\n    Derrick Hand-Book.” Those on which the water-white line is based are\r\n    from the Oil, Paint and Drug Reporter.\r\n\r\n  A shows the variations in the price per gallon of refined oil for\r\n    export in barrels in New York. The price of barrels varies slightly,\r\n    but is usually estimated at 2½ cents per gallon.\r\n\r\n  B shows the variations in the price per gallon of crude oil in bulk at\r\n    the wells.\r\n\r\n  C shows the variations in the price per gallon of water-white oil\r\n    (150° test) in barrels in New York. This is the usual domestic oil.\r\n\r\n  The margin or difference between the price of crude and refined is\r\n    easily calculated. Thus at the end of 1876 the crude line shows the\r\n    price of crude to be about nine cents—the price of refined about\r\n    twenty-nine; the margin was therefore twenty cents.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere were many reasons why this margin fell so enormously in these\r\nyears. All of the refiners’ expenses had rapidly decreased. In 1866 but\r\ntwo railroads came into the oil country; by 1872 there were four\r\nconnections, and freights fell in consequence. In 1866 carrying oil from\r\nthe wells by pipe-lines was first practised with success, by 1872 all\r\noil was gathered by pipes, thus saving the tedious and expensive\r\noperations of teaming. Tank-cars for carrying crude oil in bulk had\r\nreplaced barrels and rack cars. The iron tank, holding 20,000 barrels,\r\nwas used instead of the wooden tank holding 1,000 barrels. On every side\r\nthere had been economies, and because of them the margin had fallen. But\r\nnot only were the expenses coming down; so were the profits. The money\r\nwhich had been made in refining oil had led to a rapid multiplication of\r\nrefineries at all the centres. In 1872 there was a daily refining\r\ncapacity of about 46,000 barrels in the country, and the daily\r\nconsumption of that year had been but 15,000 barrels. This large\r\ncapacity produced the liveliest competition in selling, and every year\r\nthe margin of profit grew smaller.\r\n\r\nNow it is natural that men should struggle to keep up a profit. The\r\nrefiners had become accustomed to making from twenty-five per cent. to\r\nfifty per cent., and even more, on every gallon of oil they put out.\r\nThey had the same extravagant notion of what they should make as the oil\r\nproducers of those early days had. No oil producer thought in the\r\nsixties that he was succeeding if his wells did not pay for themselves\r\nin six months! And as their new industry slowly but surely came under\r\nthe laws of trade, increased its production, was subjected to severe\r\ncompetition, as they saw themselves, in order to sustain their business,\r\nforced to practise economies and to accept smaller profits, they loudly\r\ncomplained. There was never a set of men who found it harder to accept\r\nthe limitations of economic laws than the oil producers of Pennsylvania.\r\nThe oil refiners showed the same dislike of the harness, and in 1871, as\r\nwe have seen, Mr. Rockefeller and a few of his friends combined to throw\r\nit off. What they proposed to do was simply to get all the refineries of\r\nthe country under their control, and thereafter make only so much oil as\r\nthey could sell at their own interpretation of a paying price.\r\n\r\nThere was not enough profit in the margin of 1871. Now what was the\r\nprofit? According to the best figures accessible of the cost of oil\r\nrefining at that day, the man who sold a gallon of oil at 24¼ cents (the\r\naverage official price for that year) made a profit of not less than 1¼\r\ncents—52½ cents a barrel.[144] Josiah Lombard, a large independent\r\nrefiner of New York City, when questioned by the Congressional Committee\r\nwhich, in 1872, looked into Mr. Rockefeller’s scheme for making oil\r\ndearer, said that his concern was making money on this margin. “We could\r\nship oil and do very well.” A. H. Tack told the Congressional Committee\r\nof 1888, which was trying to find out why he had been obliged to go out\r\nof the refining business in 1873, that he could have made twelve per\r\ncent. on his capital with a profit of ten cents a barrel. Scofield,\r\nShurmer and Teagle, of Cleveland, made a profit of thirty-four cents a\r\nbarrel in 1875, and cleared $40,000 on an investment of $65,000.\r\nFifty-two cents a barrel profit then was certainly not to be despised.\r\nThe South Improvement Company gentlemen were not modest in the matter of\r\nprofits, however, and they launched the scheme whose basic principles\r\nhave figured so largely in the development of the Standard Oil Trust.\r\n\r\nThe success which Mr. Rockefeller had in getting the refiners of the\r\ncountry under his control, and the methods he took to do it, we have\r\ntraced. It will be remembered that for a brief period in 1872 and 1873\r\nhe held together an association pledged to curtail the output of oil,\r\nbut that in July, 1873, it went to pieces.[145] It will be recalled that\r\nthree years after, in 1875, he put a second association into operation,\r\nwhich in a year claimed a control of ninety per cent. of the refining\r\npower of the country, and in less than four years controlled ninety-five\r\nper cent.[146] This large percentage Mr. Rockefeller has not been able\r\nto keep, but from 1879 to the present day there has not been a time when\r\nhe has not controlled over eighty per cent. of the oil manufacturing of\r\nthe country. To-day he controls about eighty-three per cent.\r\n\r\nNow it is generally conceded that the man or men who control over\r\nseventy per cent. of a commodity control its price—within limits, very\r\nstrict limits, too, such is the force of economic laws. In the case of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company the control is so complete that the price of\r\noil, both crude and refined, is actually issued from its headquarters.\r\n\r\nNow, with the help of the chart, let us see what Mr. Rockefeller and his\r\ncolleagues have been able to do from 1872 to 1904 with their power over\r\nthe price of oil. The first association which worked was brought about\r\nlate in 1872. What happened? Prices for refined oil were run up from 23\r\ncents a gallon in June to 27 cents a gallon in November, and the margin\r\nincreased from 13.6 cents to 17.7 cents. From a profit of about 1½ cents\r\na gallon they rose to one of over 4 cents. Unfortunately, however, the\r\nrefiners of that period were not educated to the self-restraint\r\nnecessary to carry out this scheme. They very soon failed to keep down\r\ntheir output of oil and overstocked the market, and the whole machine\r\nwent to pieces. Mr. Rockefeller had been able to make oil dear for a\r\nshort time, but only for a short time. Worse than that, what he had been\r\nable to do brought severe public condemnation. It had, indeed, produced\r\nexactly the result the economists tell us too high prices must\r\nproduce—limitation of the market and stimulation of competition in rival\r\ngoods. Mr. Rockefeller’s second scheme to work out the good of the oil\r\nbusiness by making oil dear resulted in decreasing oil exports for the\r\nfirst time since the discovery of oil.[147] It also increased one of the\r\nchief grievances of the American refinery—that was, the exporting of the\r\ncrude oil to be refined in Europe. Where the exports of crude had been\r\nsomething over eleven million gallons in 1871, they were now over\r\nsixteen millions. And it set the shale-oil factories of Scotland to work\r\nmerrily. It was cheaper for Great Britain to use oil from Scottish\r\nshales than to buy oil sold under Mr. Rockefeller’s great plan for\r\nbenefiting the oil business. So for the time the scheme fell down.\r\n\r\nAs the diagram shows, the margin dropped rapidly back after this brief\r\nsuccess from eighteen to thirteen cents, nor did it stay there. With the\r\nreturn of competition, in the fall of 1873, it continued to drop\r\nrapidly. By the end of the year it was down to eleven cents; by the end\r\nof 1874 to nine. What had done it? A decline in expenses, coming from\r\nthe multiplication of pipe-lines, reduction in freight charges, and free\r\ncompetition in the markets. Nothing else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1866 TO 1872.\r\n\r\n  Fragment of oil chart, showing decline of margin between crude and\r\n    refined oil in the first seven years after the pipe-line was proved\r\n    practical. Notice sudden rise in refined oil in 1872 caused by the\r\n    first Refiners’ Association.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1872 TO 1877.\r\n\r\n  Fragment of oil chart, showing decline in margin after the failure of\r\n    the Refiners’ Association in 1872, and the abnormal increase in the\r\n    margin in 1876, when the next combination was perfected.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the obvious economic effects of his scheme in 1872 Mr.\r\nRockefeller did not give up his theory that to make oil dear was for the\r\ngood of the business. He went steadily ahead, developing quietly his\r\nplan of a union of all refiners, pledged to limit their output of oil to\r\nan allotment he should assign, to accept the freight rates he should\r\narrange for, to buy and sell at the prices he set. It was a year before\r\nthe alliance was nearly enough complete to make its power felt. By the\r\nsummer of 1876 it claimed to have nine-tenths of the refiners in the\r\ncountry in line. At that time a situation rose in the crude oil market\r\nwell calculated to help it in its intention to raise prices. This was a\r\nfalling off in the production of crude oil. An advance in its price had\r\ncome in the summer of 1876. Refined had, of course, responded to the\r\nrise. But as the fall came on and the exporters prepared to load their\r\ncargoes, the syndicate demanded a price for refined much above that for\r\nwhich the market price of crude called. The embargo which followed has\r\nalready been described in Chapter VII of this narrative. It was as\r\nstraight a hold-up as our commercial history offers, rich as it is in\r\nthat sort of operations. From October to February refined oil was held\r\nat a price purely arbitrary. It was the first fruits of the Great\r\nScheme.\r\n\r\nThe winter’s work was a great one for the Standard Combination. It not\r\nonly demonstrated that Mr. Rockefeller was correct in his theory that\r\nthe way to make oil dear was to refuse to sell it cheap, but not since\r\nthe coup of 1872, with the South Improvement Company, had Mr.\r\nRockefeller reaped such rewards. The profits were staggering. One of the\r\nleading gentlemen in this pretty affair told the writer once that he had\r\nsold one cargo at thirty-five cents a gallon, oil which cost him on\r\nboard the ship a trifle under ten cents. To-day one-fourth of a cent\r\nprofit a gallon is considered large on export oil. The Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Ohio had always paid a good dividend,[148] but the year of\r\nthis raid, 1877, it surpassed all bounds. On a capitalisation of\r\n$3,500,000 it paid $3,248,650.01, only a fraction less than 100 per\r\ncent. One of its stockholders, the late Samuel Andrews, when on the\r\nwitness-stand in 1879, said they might have paid the dividend twice over\r\nand had money to spare.\r\n\r\nThe profits were great, but notice the forces set in motion by this\r\ncoup. The exporters were angry. The buyers in Europe were angry. If the\r\nAmericans are going to force up prices in this way, they said, we will\r\nnot buy their refined oil. We will import their crude and refine it\r\nourselves. We will go back to shale oil. A first result, then, of this\r\nattempt to hold prices up to a point conspicuously out of proportion to\r\nthe raw product was that the exports of illuminating oil fell off—they\r\nwere less by a million gallons in 1878 than in 1877. In the United\r\nStates the market was threatened in the same way. There had been much\r\ntrouble in the years just preceding these events with extortionate\r\nprices for gas—particularly in New York and Brooklyn. Illuminating oil\r\nwas so much cheaper that it had been largely substituted, but this\r\nartificial forcing of the oil market in 1876–1877 caused a threat to\r\nreturn the next year to gas.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the refiners who were operating with Mr. Rockefeller in\r\nrunning arrangements was decidedly bad. Each refiner was under bonds to\r\nuse only a certain percentage of his capacity, and to shut down entirely\r\nif Mr. Rockefeller said so. Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, independents\r\nof Cleveland, who had yielded to the attractiveness of Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\nscheme, and had gone into a running arrangement with him to limit their\r\noutput, made $2.52 a barrel on their oil from July, 1876, to July, 1877!\r\nThey had been satisfied with thirty-four cents profit a barrel the year\r\nbefore. Since making oil paid so well, why not make more? Why keep their\r\nallotment down to exactly 85,000 barrels, as they had agreed, when they\r\nwere prepared to make 180,000? They did not. They put out a few extra\r\nthousand barrels each year. Others did the same. It was, of course,\r\nfatal to the “good of the oil business.” Not only did these profits\r\ntempt many refiners to overrun their allotment; the few independents\r\nleft profited by the prices and increased their plants; the great Empire\r\nTransportation Company combined refineries with its pipe-lines as Mr.\r\nRockefeller was adding pipe-lines to his refineries. Thus competition\r\nwas stimulated.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the men who produced oil was, of course, bad. They had\r\nfound it impossible at any time, while the refined was kept so high, to\r\nforce crude up to a corresponding point, though every effort was made.\r\nThe producers threatened to combine and refine their own oil. When the\r\nEmpire Transportation Company went into refining the producers heartily\r\nfavoured the movement, and throughout the next year a severe competition\r\nkept prices down. The Empire was finally wiped out; the producers,\r\naroused by this failure, combined against the Standard in one of the\r\ngreatest associations they ever had. From 1878 to 1880 they fought\r\ncontinuously to restore competition. They secured the introduction into\r\nCongress of a bill to regulate interstate commerce; they fought for more\r\ndrastic laws against railroad discrimination in the state of\r\nPennsylvania; they persuaded the state to prosecute the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad for discrimination; they indicted Mr. Rockefeller and eight of\r\nhis colleagues for criminal conspiracy; and they supported by money and\r\ninfluence a scheme for a seaboard pipe-line connected with the\r\nindependent refineries.[149]\r\n\r\nIf one will look at the chart he will see graphically the effect on Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s ambition of this fundamentally sound independent movement.\r\nThe margin between crude and refined, thrust up to over twenty cents by\r\nthe combination of 1878, fell rapidly under the combined efforts of the\r\nindependents through 1877, 1878 and 1879. In the latter year it touched\r\nfive cents for the first time in the history of the business.\r\nCompetition resulting in economies, in a revolutionising transportation\r\ninvention—the seaboard pipe-line—in a greatly extended foreign market,\r\nbrought down this margin in 1879. Nothing else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1876 TO 1880.\r\n\r\n  Fragment of chart, showing decline in margin after the coup of\r\n    1876–1877, caused by alliance of independent oil men and the success\r\n    of the first seaboard pipe-line.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThose who have read this history know what became of the competitive\r\nmovement of these years of 1878–1879. They remember how the Producers’\r\nUnion compromised its suits and abandoned its efforts for interstate\r\ncommerce regulation. They remember, too, how, just before the great\r\nseaboard pipe-line project was proved to be a success, all but one of\r\nthe independent refineries were, by one means or another, persuaded to\r\nsell or to combine with the Standard, leaving the Tidewater without an\r\noutlet for its oil. Before the end of 1879 the Standard claimed\r\nninety-five per cent. of the refining business. Now examine the chart\r\nfor the effect on the price of oil in 1880, of this doing away with\r\ncompetition—another sudden uplift of the price of refined, this time\r\nwithout the excuse of a rise or probable rise in crude. For three years\r\noil had not been sold so high as it was in 1880, when the exporters\r\nbegan to take on their winter’s supply. An interesting contemporary\r\naccount of this coup of 1880, and the way in which it was managed, is\r\nfound in the excellent monthly Petroleum Trade Report, published by John\r\nC. Welch. It is dated November, 1880, and headed “Very Sharp Practice”:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There is made each day in New York what is known as an official\r\n  quotation for refined oil, this official quotation being made as a\r\n  matter of convenience in cabling the price of refined oil throughout\r\n  the world. Refined oil not being sold at an open board, it is\r\n  sometimes difficult to quote it accurately, but by having an\r\n  ‘official quotation’ this can be quoted, and the difficulty is\r\n  supposed to be, in a measure at least, remedied. The ‘official\r\n  quotation’ is made by three petroleum brokers appointed by the\r\n  Produce Exchange for that purpose, who meet each day after exchange\r\n  hours for the purpose of establishing it. There is one party, and\r\n  one party only, that have very large lots to sell, and so important\r\n  a position do they hold in the business that their prices are\r\n  ordinarily the market. Of course, to make transactions, their prices\r\n  and buyers’ prices have to come together, and transactions establish\r\n  a market much better than prices offered to buy or sell at, but\r\n  without transactions. At many times, if the Standard do not sell,\r\n  there are no transactions, and, consequently, the Standard’s asking\r\n  price is leaned upon to establish an official quotation. During\r\n  September, the official quotation went up from 9⅜ cents to 11⅞\r\n  cents, with comparatively little demand, as the foreign stocks were\r\n  large, and very little oil was required to supply the world’s wants.\r\n  The upward movement was, consequently, purely arbitrary. Arbitrary\r\n  prices are, however, a part of the Standard’s every-day life, and I\r\n  am not taking at this time any exception to them. All through\r\n  October and up to November 13, the official quotation was 12 cents,\r\n  or sometimes a little over and sometimes a little under, and as this\r\n  price did not meet the views of buyers to but slight extent, the\r\n  Standard were supposed to be exercising a Roman virtue in not\r\n  selling. Twelve cents continued as the official quotation to\r\n  November 13, without any wavering, but from the 13th to the 18th,\r\n  while ‘12 cents asked by refiners’ continued in the quotation, such\r\n  sentences as these were included at different dates: ‘Other lots\r\n  obtainable at 11 cents.’ ‘Sales at 10½ cents, offered at that.’\r\n  ‘Other lots obtainable at irregular prices, from 10 to 10½ cents.’\r\n  On November 18, the quotation was ‘10 to 12 cents.’ I give the\r\n  following quotation of the New York refined market as published in\r\n  my Oil City daily report of November 11: ‘The New York market\r\n  yesterday closed, secretly offered and unsalable at 11½ cents, and\r\n  probably at 11¼ cents by resales and outside refiners, and likely by\r\n  Standard, though they openly ask 12.’\r\n\r\n  “The point that seems apparent is that the official quotation of 12\r\n  cents ceased to be an honest quotation a considerable time before it\r\n  was abandoned. The committee making the quotation can probably\r\n  justify their position by the custom of the trade of regarding the\r\n  prices the Standard openly ask as the market, nevertheless they, and\r\n  the Produce Exchange whom they represent, were the bulwark from\r\n  behind which the Standard were able to get off their hot shot\r\n  against the consuming trade in the United States and the consuming\r\n  trade in Europe, who all this time were buying Standard oil on the\r\n  basis of 12 cents at New York, the supplies at the time being drawn\r\n  from their stock in Europe and from their various depots in the\r\n  United States.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the performance of 1876 and 1877 was not forgotten in Europe. In\r\n1879 the exporters and buyers from all the great foreign markets had met\r\nin Bremen in an indignation meeting over the way the Standard was\r\nhandling the oil business. Remonstrances came from the consuls at\r\nAntwerp and Bremen to our State Department concerning even the quality\r\nof oil which had been sent to Europe by the Standard. John C. Welch, who\r\nwas abroad in 1879, was told by a prominent Antwerp merchant: “I am of\r\nthe opinion that if the petroleum business continues to be conducted as\r\nit has been in the past in Europe, it will go to smash.”[150] The\r\nattempt to repeat in 1880 what had been done in 1876 failed. The exports\r\nof illuminating oil that year fell much below what they had been the\r\nyear before. In 1879, 365,000,000 gallons of refined oil were exported;\r\nin 1880, only 286,000,000 gallons. Exports of crude, on the contrary,\r\nrose from about 28,000,000 gallons to nearly 37,000,000 gallons. The\r\nforeigners could export and refine their own oil cheaper than they could\r\nbuy from Mr. Rockefeller. Competition was after him, too, for the\r\nTidewater, whose refineries he had cut off, had stored their oil, built\r\nnew plants, and were again ready to compete in the market.\r\n\r\nThis third corner of the oil market seems to have convinced Mr.\r\nRockefeller and his colleagues at last that, however great the fun and\r\nprofits of making oil very dear, in the long run it does not pay; that\r\nit weakens markets and stimulates competition. They learned a lesson in\r\nthese years they have never forgotten—that when you make a scoop it must\r\nnot be so big that you will never have a chance to make another one;\r\nthat if you want to keep your power to manipulate the market you must\r\nuse that power so modestly that the public in general will not realise\r\nyou have it. Again and again the effect of the experiences of 1872, 1876\r\nand 1880 crops out in the testimony of Standard officials. Benjamin\r\nBrewster once said to a Federal Investigating Committee, which had asked\r\nif the Standard could not fix the price of oil as it wished: “At the\r\nmoment many things may be done, but the reaction is like a relapse of\r\ntyphoid fever. The Standard Oil Company can never afford to sell goods\r\ndear. The people would go to dipping tallow candles in the old-fashioned\r\nway if we got the price too high.” The after-effects of the first great\r\nraids, then, were salutary. The Standard learned the limitations set on\r\nmonopolies by certain great economic laws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1879 TO 1889.\r\n\r\n  Fragment of chart, showing how margin reached in 1879 by competition\r\n    was raised and sustained for ten years under the monopoly achieved\r\n    by the Standard Oil Company in 1880. The sudden rise in refined in\r\n    the fall of 1880 was a purely arbitrary price. Notice that crude was\r\n    stationary at the time.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut if the Standard Oil Company learned in its first attempts to raise\r\nthe price of oil that they could not in the long run afford to make from\r\n100 to 350 per cent., they by no means gave up their attempt to keep\r\ntheir control, and to hold up profits as high as they could without\r\ninjuring the market or inviting too strong competition. If one will look\r\nat the chart showing the fluctuations from 1879, when control was\r\nachieved, to the beginning of 1889, one will find that for ten years the\r\nmargin between refined oil and crude never fell below the point reached\r\nby competitive influences in the former year, though frequently it rose\r\nconsiderably above. Yet it is in this period that the Standard did all\r\nits great work in extending markets, in developing by-products, and in\r\nintroducing the small and varied economies on which it rests its claim\r\nto be a great public benefactor. The first eight years of its existence\r\nhad been spent in bold and relentless warfare on its competitors.\r\nCompetition practically out of the way, it set all its great energies to\r\ndeveloping what it had secured. In this period it brought into line the\r\nforeign markets and aided in increasing the exports of illuminating oil\r\nfrom 365,000,000 gallons in 1879 to 455,000,000 in 1888; of lubricating,\r\nfrom 3,000,000 to 24,000,000, and yet this great extension of the volume\r\nof business profited the consumer nothing. In this period it laid hands\r\non the idea of the Tidewater, the long-distance pipe-lines for\r\ntransporting crude oil, and so rid itself practically of the railroads,\r\nand yet this immense economy profited the public nothing. In spite of\r\nthe immense development of this system and the enormous economies it\r\nbrought about—a system so important that Mr. Rockefeller himself has\r\nsaid: “The entire oil business is dependent upon this pipe-line system.\r\nWithout it every well would shut down, and every foreign market would be\r\nclosed to us”—the margins never fell the fraction of a cent from 1879 to\r\n1889, though it frequently rose. In this period, too, the by-products of\r\noil were enormously increased. The waste, formerly as much as ten per\r\ncent. of the crude product, was reduced until practically all of the oil\r\nis worked up by the Standard people, and yet, in spite of the extension\r\nof by-products between 1879 and 1889, the margin never went below the\r\npoint competition had forced it to in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe enormous profits which came to the Standard in these ten years by\r\nkeeping out competition are evident if we consider for a moment the\r\namount of business done. The exports of illuminating oil in this period\r\nwere nearly 5,000,000,000 gallons; of this the Standard handled well\r\ntoward ninety per cent. Consider what sums lay in the ability to hold up\r\nthe price on such an amount even an eighth of a cent a gallon. Combine\r\nthis control of the price of refined oil with the control over the crude\r\nproduct, the ability to depress the market for purchasing, an ability\r\nused most carefully, but most constantly; add to this the economies and\r\ndevelopment Mr. Rockefeller’s able and energetic machine was making, and\r\nthe great profits of the Standard Oil Trust between 1879 and 1889 are\r\neasily explained. In 1879, on a capital of $3,500,000, the Standard Oil\r\nCompany paid $3,150,000 dividends; in 1880 it paid $1,050,000. In 1882\r\nit capitalised itself at $70,000,000. In 1885, three years later, its\r\nnet earnings were over $8,000,000; in 1886, over $15,000,000; in 1888,\r\nover $16,000,000; in 1889, nearly $15,000,000. In the meantime the net\r\nvalue of its holdings had increased from $72,000,000; in 1883, to over\r\n$101,000,000. While the Standard was making these great sums, the men\r\nwho produced the oil saw their property depreciating, and the value of\r\ntheir oil actually eaten up every two years by the prices the Standard\r\ncharged for gathering and storing it.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the chart. With the beginning of 1889 the margin begins\r\nto fall. This is so in spite of a rising crude line. It would look as if\r\nthe Standard Oil Company had suddenly had a change of heart. In the\r\nreport of that year’s business made to the trustees of the Standard Oil\r\nTrust, the following elaborate and interesting calculation was\r\npresented:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The quantity of crude oil consumed by the Standard manufacturing\r\n  interests in 1889 was 896,250,325 gallons, or 20,339,293 barrels, an\r\n  increase over the previous year of 119,073,589 gallons, or 2,835,085\r\n  barrels, an increase of 15.3 percent.\r\n\r\n  “The sales of crude oil by our interests for purposes other than\r\n  their own manufacture were 135,788,959 gallons, or 3,232,832\r\n  barrels, an increase of 43¼ per cent. over the previous year, making\r\n  the total consumption of crude oil through our interests\r\n  1,032,029,284 gallons, or 24,572,126 barrels, an increase over 1888\r\n  of 3,809,917 barrels, or 18.35 per cent., and exceeding the\r\n  consumption of 1887, which was the largest of any previous year, by\r\n  12.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n  “The quantity of refined oil produced was 666,742,547 gallons, or\r\n  13,334,851 barrels of 50 gallons each; of lubricating paraffine and\r\n  compounded oils 43,862,795 gallons, or 877,256 barrels, and of other\r\n  products 160,712,183 gallons, or 3,214,243 barrels, making a total\r\n  of all products of 871,371,525 gallons, or 17,426,350 barrels,\r\n  valued at over $46,000,000.\r\n\r\n  “The average cost of the crude consumed in refining was .211 of a\r\n  cent more than in 1888, while the average price realised per gallon\r\n  of crude was .090 of a cent less, showing a decrease in the margin\r\n  between the crude and finished product of .301 of a cent. This\r\n  represents a saving to the consumer over what the finished products\r\n  would have cost him if the same margin had been maintained on the\r\n  increased price of crude of $2,697,000. This has been done without a\r\n  corresponding loss to our interests by a decrease in cost of\r\n  manufacturing and marketing, and by the increased quantity handled\r\n  .204 of a cent, effecting a saving of $1,860,000, and the difference\r\n  has been more than made up by further reductions of cost of\r\n  marketing by our distributing interests, as well as in the increased\r\n  quantity handled. Although the average price of crude has been the\r\n  highest this year of any of the last five years, the increase over\r\n  the price of 1887 (when the price on both crude and refined was the\r\n  lowest for that period) being about 22¼ per cent., the average price\r\n  of products has increased but 12¼ per cent., showing a saving to the\r\n  consumer of 10 per cent. We have therefore continued to make good\r\n  the claim that the Standard has heretofore maintained of cheapening\r\n  the cost of the products to the consumers by giving them the\r\n  benefits of the saving in costs effected by consolidation of\r\n  interests.”[151]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis certainly sounds just—even philanthropic. It is exactly what the\r\nconsumer claims is his due—to have a share of the economies which\r\nundoubtedly may be effected by such complete and intelligent\r\nconsolidation as Mr. Rockefeller has effected. But was it combination\r\nthat caused this falling of the margin? As a matter of fact this\r\nlowering of the margin was the direct result of competition. In 1888 a\r\nGerman firm, located in New York City, erected large oil plants in\r\nRotterdam and Bremerhaven. They put up storage tanks at each place of\r\n90,000 barrels’ capacity. They also established a storage depot of\r\n30,000 barrels at Mannheim, and took steps to extend their supply\r\nstations in Germany and Switzerland. They built tank steamers in order\r\nto ship their oil in bulk. These oil importers allied themselves with\r\ncertain independent refiners, and interested themselves also in the\r\nco-operative movement which the producers of Pennsylvania were striving\r\nto get into operation at this time. The extent of the undertaking\r\nthreatened serious competition. In the same year imports of Russian oil\r\ninto the markets of Western Europe began for the first time to assume\r\nserious proportions. Russian oil had, from the beginning, been a\r\npossible menace to American petroleum, for the wonderful fields on the\r\nCaspian were known long before oil was “struck” in Pennsylvania. They\r\ndid not begin to be exploited in a way to threaten competition until\r\nlate in the eighties. In 1885 consuls at European ports began to report\r\nits appearance—fifty barrels were landed at Bremen that year as against\r\n180,855 of American oil. In this year, too, the first Russian oil went\r\nto Asia Minor, where “Pratt” oil had long held sway. The first cargo\r\nreported at Antwerp was in March, 1886. In April, 1890, the consul at\r\nRotterdam, in calling attention to the independent American competition,\r\nsaid of Russian oil: “It is no longer a serious competitor for the\r\npetroleum trade of Western Continental Europe.” The consul said that\r\nwhile the American oil shipments to the five principal continental ports\r\nwere fully 4,000,000 barrels per year, those of Russian were less than a\r\ntenth of that number. However, a growth of 400,000 barrels in five years\r\nwas something, and the Standard Oil Trust was the last to underestimate\r\nsuch a growth. Prices of export oil immediately fell. There was nothing\r\nin the world that gave oil consumers the benefit of the Standard’s\r\nsavings by economies in 1889 but the competition threatened by Russia\r\nand the American and German independent alliance. The Standard, to\r\noffset it, not only lowered its price, but it followed the German\r\ncompany to Rotterdam in order to put up an oil plant similar to the one\r\nwhich had been erected by those independents. They also purchased at\r\nthis time the great oil establishments at Bremen and Hamburg which had\r\nhitherto been owned and operated by Germans. A full account of this new\r\ndevelopment in the oil trade was reported by the American consul at\r\nRotterdam in April of 1890, and is to be found in the consular reports\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1890 TO 1904.\r\n\r\n  Fragment of chart, showing relation between crude and refined oil in\r\n    the last fourteen years. Notice effect on margin from 1890 to 1894\r\n    of rise of strong competitive forces. Notice also how margin between\r\n    price of crude and of domestic oil increased in the winter of\r\n    1903–1904, during the coal famine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFollow the lines a little farther. Notice how, in 1892, the price of\r\nrefined oil begins to fall, although crude is stationary. Notice how the\r\nrefined line remains steady throughout 1893 and 1894, although the crude\r\nline steadily rises. This went on for nearly three years, until there\r\nwas a margin of only three cents between crude and refined oil. The\r\nbarrel, which is always reckoned in the official quotations of export\r\nrefined oil, costs two and a half cents per gallon, and the price of\r\nmanufacturing is usually put at one-half a cent. The cost of\r\ntransporting the oil was not covered by the margin the greater part of\r\nthe year 1894. Now, the Standard Oil Company were not selling oil at a\r\nloss at this time out of love for the consumers, although they made\r\nenough money in 1894 on by-products and domestic oil to have done\r\nso—their net earnings were over $15,000,000 in 1894, and they reckoned\r\nan increase in net value of property of over $4,000,000—they were\r\nfighting Russian oil and the independent combination started in 1889. By\r\n1892 this combination was in active operation. The extent of this\r\nmovement was described in the last chapter of this narrative. At the\r\nsame time certain large producers in the McDonald oil field built a\r\npipe-line from Pittsburg to Baltimore, the Crescent Line, and began to\r\nship crude oil to France in great quantities. It looked as if both\r\ncombinations meant to do business, and the Standard set out to get them\r\nout of the way. One method they took was to prevent the refiners in the\r\ncombination making any money on export oil.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which cutting was carried on for two years, beginning with\r\nthe fall of 1892, has been referred to in the last chapter, but is\r\nperhaps worth repeating in this connection. In January of 1892 crude oil\r\nwas selling at 53½ cents a barrel at the wells, and refined oil for\r\nexport at 5.33 cents a gallon in barrels. Throughout the year the price\r\nof crude advanced, until in December it was 78⅜ cents. Refined, on the\r\ncontrary, fell, and it was actually 18 points lower in December than it\r\nhad been twelve months before. Throughout 1894 Standard kept refined oil\r\ndown; the average price of the year was 5.19 cents a gallon, in face of\r\nan average crude market of 83¾ cents, lower than in January, 1893, with\r\ncrude at 53½ cents a barrel.\r\n\r\nAfter two years they gave it up. It was too expensive. The Crescent Line\r\nsold to them, but the other independents were too plucky. They had lost\r\nmoney for two years, but they were still hanging on like grim death, and\r\nthe Standard concluded to concentrate their attacks on other points of\r\nthe combination rather than on this export market where it was costing\r\nthem so much.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of 1894 the depression of export oil was abandoned, as the\r\nchart shows. Notice that from 1895 to 1898 the margin remained at about\r\nfour cents, that in 1900 it rose to six cents, and from that time until\r\nJune, 1904, it swung between four and a half and five. The increasing\r\ncompetition in Western Europe of independent American oils, and the\r\nrapid rise since 1895, particularly of Russian oil, are what has kept\r\nthis margin down. It is doubtful, such is the growing strength of these\r\nvarious competitive forces, if the Standard Oil Trust will ever be able\r\nto put up the margin on export oils. If there were only the American\r\nindependents to reckon with, a compromise might be possible, but Russia,\r\nBurmah and Sumatra are all in the game. By 1896 Russia was exporting\r\n210,000,000 gallons of petroleum products (America in that year exported\r\nover 931,000,000 gallons), and these products were going to nearly every\r\npart of Europe and Asia. They began to cut heavily into the trade of the\r\nStandard in China, India, Great Britain and France. By 1899 the exports\r\nof Russian oil were over 347,000,000 gallons; in 1901, over 428,000,000\r\ngallons. In China, India, and Great Britain particularly, has the\r\nRussian competition increased. While at one time the Standard Oil\r\nCompany had almost the entire oil trade at the port of Calcutta, last\r\nyear, 1903, out of 91,500,000 gallons imported, only about 6,500,000\r\ngallons were of American oil. In China, Sumatra oil is now ahead of\r\nAmerican, the report for 1903 being: American, 31,060,527 gallons;\r\nSumatra, 39,859,508.\r\n\r\nFor the Standard there is good profit in this margin of four and a half\r\ncents for export oil. The expenses the margin must cover are the\r\ntransportation of the crude from the wells to New York, the cost of\r\nmanufacture, the barrel and the loading. For twenty-five years the\r\npublished charge of the Standard Oil Company for gathering oil from the\r\nwells has been twenty cents a barrel. The charge for bringing it to New\r\nYork has been forty cents, a little less than one and a half cents a\r\ngallon. It costs, by rough calculation, one-half a cent to make the oil\r\nand load it. The barrel is usually reckoned at two and a half cents.\r\nHere are four and a half cents for expenses—the entire margin. Where the\r\nStandard has the advantage is in its ownership of oil transportation. A\r\ncommon carrier gathering and transporting in 1902 all but perhaps 10,000\r\nbarrels of the 150,000 barrels’ daily production of Eastern oil, the\r\nservice for which the outsider pays sixty cents, costs it from ten to\r\ntwelve cents at the most liberal estimate. Here is over a cent saved on\r\na gallon, and a cent saved, where millions of gallons are in question,\r\nmakes not only great profits, but keeps down competition. The refiner\r\nwho to-day must pay the Standard rates for transportation cannot compete\r\nin export oil with them. In January of 1904, when the chart shows the\r\nmargin to have been about four and three-quarter cents, an independent\r\nrefiner in the state of Ohio, dependent on the Standard for oil, gave\r\nthe writer a detailed statement of costs and selling prices of products\r\nin his refinery. According to his statement he lost one and three-fifth\r\ncents on his export oil. He was forced, of course, to pay Standard\r\ntransportation prices for crude and railroad charges for refined from\r\nOhio to New York harbour.[152]\r\n\r\nThat there would have been such a transportation situation to-day had it\r\nnot been for the discrimination by the railways, which threw the pipes\r\ninto the Standard’s hands in the first place, and the long story of\r\naggression by which the Standard has kept out rival pipes, and so been\r\nable for twenty-five years to sustain the price for transportation, is\r\nof course evident. To-day, as thirty years ago, it is transportation\r\nadvantages, unfairly won, which give the Standard Oil Company its hold.\r\nIt is not only on transportation that the Standard to-day has great\r\nadvantages over the independent refiner in the export market. As said at\r\nthe beginning of this chapter, the Standard Oil Company “makes the price\r\nof refined oil”—within strict limits. Of course, making the market, it\r\nhas all the advantages of the “inside track.” Its transactions can be\r\ncarried on in anticipation of the rise or fall. For instance, in January\r\nof 1904, when there were strong fluctuations in the water-white (150\r\ndegrees test) prices, the agent of an independent refiner, who was in\r\nWall Street trying to keep track of markets for out-of-town competitors,\r\nreported the price as 9.20 cents a gallon. The refiners’ goods were\r\nrefused on the ground that this was above the market. The Standard Oil\r\nexport man and a broker who worked with the company were consulted. The\r\nmarket was 9.20. Further investigation, however, showed that at\r\nheadquarters the figure given out privately was 8.70 cents. The\r\ndisadvantage of the outsider in disposing of his goods is obvious. The\r\nStandard makes the official market, and undersells it. The situation\r\nseems to be the same in practice as that described by Mr. Welch, in\r\n1880, though now the fiction of a committee of brokers has been done\r\naway with. Of course there is nothing else to be expected when one body\r\nof men control a market.\r\n\r\nThus far the illustrations of Mr. Rockefeller’s use of his power over\r\nthe oil market have been drawn from export oil. It is the only market\r\nfor which “official” figures can be obtained for the entire period, and\r\nit is the market usually quoted in studying the movement of prices. It\r\nis of this grade of oil that the largest percentage of product is\r\nobtained in distilling petroleum. For instance, in distilling\r\nPennsylvania crude, fifty-two per cent. is standard-white or export oil,\r\ntwenty-two per cent. water-white—the higher grade commonly used in this\r\ncountry—thirteen per cent. naphtha, ten per cent. tar, three per cent.\r\nloss. The runs vary with different oils, and different refiners turn out\r\ndifferent products. The water-white oils, while they cost the same to\r\nproduce, sell from two to three cents higher. The naphtha costs the same\r\nto make as export oil, but sells at a higher price, and many refiners\r\nhave pet brands, for which, through some marketing trick, they get a\r\nfancy price. The Standard Oil Company has a great number of fancy brands\r\nof both illuminating and lubricating oils, for which they get large\r\nprices—although often the oil itself comes from the same barrels as the\r\nordinary grade. Now it is from the extra price obtained from naphtha,\r\nwater-white, fancy brands, and by-products that the independent refiner\r\nmakes up for his loss on export oil, and the Standard Oil Trust raises\r\nits dividends to forty-eight per cent. The independent refiner quoted\r\nabove, who in January of 1904 lost 1⅜ cents on export oil, made enough\r\non other products to clear 8.3 cents a barrel on his output—eighty-three\r\ndollars a day clear on a refinery of 1,000 barrels capacity, which\r\nrepresents an investment of $150,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A TYPICAL OIL FARM OF THE EARLY DAYS\r\n]\r\n\r\nTurn now to the price of domestic oil, and examine the chart to see if\r\nwe have fared as well as the exporters. The line C on the chart\r\nrepresents the price per gallon in New York City of 150° water-white oil\r\nin barrels from the beginning of 1881 to June, 1904.[153] The figures\r\nused are those of the Oil, Paint and Drug Reporter. A glance at the\r\nchart is enough to show that the home market has suffered more violent,\r\nif less frequent, fluctuations than the export market. A suggestive\r\nobservation for the consumer is the effect of a rise in crude on the\r\nprice of domestic oil. The refined line usually rises two or three\r\npoints to every one of the crude line. It is interesting to note, too,\r\nhow frequently high domestic prices are made to offset low export\r\nprices; thus, in 1889, when the Standard was holding export oil low to\r\nfight competition in Europe, it kept up domestic oil. The same thing is\r\nhappening to-day. We are helping pay for the Standard’s fight with\r\nRussian, Roumanian and Asiatic oils. But this line, while it shows what\r\nthe New York trade has paid, is a poor guide for the country as a whole.\r\nDomestic oil, indeed, has no regular price. Go back as far as anything\r\nlike trustworthy documents exist, and we find the most astonishing\r\nvagaries, even in the same state. For instance, in a table presented to\r\na Congressional Committee in 1888, and compiled from answers to letters\r\nsent out by George Rice, the price of 110° oil in barrels in Texas\r\nranged from 10 to 20 cents; in Arkansas, of 150° oil in barrels, from 8\r\nto 18; in Tennessee, the same oil, from 8 to 16; in Mississippi, the\r\nsame, from 11 to 17. In the eighties, prime white oil sold in barrels,\r\nwholesale, in Arkansas, all the way from 8 to 14 cents; in Illinois,\r\nfrom 7½ to 10; in Mississippi, from 7¼ to 13½; in Nebraska, 7½ to 18; in\r\nSouth Carolina, 8 to 12½; and in Utah, 13 to 23. Freight and handling\r\nmight, of course, account for one to two cents of the difference, but\r\nnot more.\r\n\r\nA table of the wide variation in the price of oil, compiled in 1892,\r\nshowed the range of price of prime white oil in the United States to be\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                      In barrels  6  to 25  cents\r\n                      In cases   14  to 34½ cents\r\n                      In bulk     3½ to 25  cents\r\n\r\nThe same wide range was found in water-white oil:\r\n\r\n                 In barrels  6½ to 30 cents per gallon\r\n                 In cases   16  to 35 cents per gallon\r\n                 In bulk     3½ to 29 cents per gallon\r\n\r\nIn 1896 an investigation of prices of oil sold from tank-wagons in the\r\ndifferent towns of Ohio, in the same week, was made, and was afterward\r\noffered as sworn testimony in a trust investigation in that state. The\r\nprice per gallon ranged from 4¾ cents to 8¾ cents.\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate investigation of oil prices ever made was that\r\ninstigated by the recent Industrial Commission. In February, 1901, the\r\ncommission sent out inquiries to 5,000 retail dealers, scattered from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Lakes to the Gulf, asking the\r\nprices of certain commodities, among them illuminating oils; 1,578\r\nreplies were received. The tables prepared offered striking examples of\r\nthe variability of prices—thus:\r\n\r\nIn Colorado the wholesale price of illuminating oil (150° test) varied\r\nfrom 13 to 20 cents; in Delaware, 8 to 10; in Illinois, 6 to 10; in\r\nAlabama, 10.50 to 16; in Michigan, 5.50 to 12.25; in Missouri, 7.50 to\r\n12.50; in Kentucky, 7 to 11.50; in Ohio, 5.50 to 9.75; in California,\r\n12.50 to 20; in Utah, 20 to 22; in Maine, 8.25 to 12.75 (freight\r\nincluded in all these prices).\r\n\r\nThe difference between the highest and the lowest wholesale prices in\r\nthe same states varies from 8 cents in Oregon (12.50 to 20.50) to 1.50\r\nin Rhode Island (8.50 to 10). Of course, in the former case, two or even\r\nthree cents of the difference may be due to freight, but hardly more.\r\nTake adjoining states, for instance. In Vermont there is a difference of\r\n4.50 cents between the highest and lowest price of oil; in New\r\nHampshire, only 1.75. In Delaware there is a difference of 2 cents; in\r\nVirginia, of 6.\r\n\r\nCompare, now, the lowest price in different states. In Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania oil was sold as low as 5.50; 6.50 is the lowest in New York\r\nState, 8.50 the lowest in Rhode Island, and 7 the lowest in New Jersey.\r\nIn Indiana oil sells as low as 5.50, but in Kansas nothing below 8.50 is\r\nreported (the freight rate to Atchison, Kansas, from Whiting, Indiana,\r\nwhich supplies both of these states, is 1.7 per gallon. The freight rate\r\nfrom Whiting to Indianapolis is .5 per gallon).\r\n\r\nNot long ago there fell into the writer’s hands a sheet from one of the\r\nledgers forming a part of the Standard Oil Company’s remarkable system\r\nof bookkeeping. This sheet gave the cost and selling price per gallon of\r\ndifferent grades of refined oil at over a dozen stations in the same\r\nstate in October, 1901. In the account of cost of oil were included net\r\ncost, freight, inspection, cost of barrels and cost of marketing. The\r\nselling price was given and the margin of profit computed. The selling\r\nprice of water-white from tank-wagons (it is customary for Standard\r\ntank-wagons to deliver oil from their stations to local dealers) ranged\r\nfrom 8½ to 11½ cents, and the profit on the oil sold from the wagons\r\nvaried from about one-half cent to over three cents.\r\n\r\nNow, in considering these differences, liberal allowance for freight\r\nrates must be made. Something of what these allowances should be can be\r\njudged from the table of oil freights which the Industrial Commission\r\npublished with its schedule of prices. From this table many interesting\r\ncomparisons can be made. For instance, it cost the Standard Oil Company\r\n(if they paid the open rate their rivals did) 1.5 cents to send a gallon\r\nof oil from Whiting, Indiana, their supply station, to Mobile, Alabama.\r\nThey sold their oil in Alabama at wholesale from 11½ to 16 cents. The\r\nnet cost of this oil was under five cents in February, 1901. It cost\r\nthem the same 1.5 cents to send a gallon of oil to Des Moines, Iowa (if\r\nthey paid the open rate), but in Iowa they sold it from 7 to 11. The\r\nfreight from Whiting to New Orleans was the same 1.5 cents, but prices\r\nin Louisiana ranged from 9 to 14 cents. According to the investigation\r\nthe average wholesale price of oil, including freight, ranged from 8.27\r\nin Pennsylvania to 25.78 in Nevada.\r\n\r\nFreights and handling considered, there is, it is evident, nothing like\r\na settled price or profit for illuminating oil in the United States.\r\nNow, there is no one who will not admit that it is for the good of the\r\nconsumer that the normal market price of any commodity should be such as\r\nwill give a fair and even profit all over the country. That is, that\r\nfreights and expense of handling being considered, oil should sell at\r\nthe same profit in Texas as in Ohio. That such must be the case where\r\nthere is free and general competition is evident. But from the beginning\r\nof its power over the market the Standard Oil Company has sold domestic\r\noil at prices varying from less than the cost of the crude oil it took\r\nto make it up to a profit of 100 per cent. or more. Wherever there has\r\nbeen a loss, or merely what is called a reasonable profit of, say, ten\r\nper cent., an examination of the tables quoted above shows conclusively\r\nit has been due to competition. The competition is not, and has not been\r\nsince 1879, very great. In that year the Standard Oil Company claimed\r\nninety-five per cent. of the refining interests of the country. In 1888\r\nthey claimed about eighty per cent.; in 1898, eighty-three per cent.\r\nThis five to seventeen per cent. of independent interest is too small to\r\ncome into active competition, of course, at all points. So long as one\r\ninterest handles eighty-three per cent. of a product it is clear that it\r\nhas the trade as a whole in its hands. The competition it encounters\r\nwill be local only. But it is this local competition, unquestionably,\r\nthat has brought down the price of oil at various points and caused the\r\nstriking variation in prices recorded in the charts of the Industrial\r\nCommission and other investigations. The writer has before her a pile of\r\na hundred or more letters written in the eighties by dealers in twelve\r\ndifferent states. These letters tell the effect on the prices of the\r\nintroduction of an independent oil into a territory formerly occupied\r\nexclusively by the Standard:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Calvert, Tenn.—The Waters-Pierce Oil Company (Standard) so reduced\r\n  the price of their oil here when mine arrived that I will have some\r\n  trouble to dispose of mine.\r\n\r\n  Chattanooga, Tenn.— ... Cut the price of oil that had been selling\r\n  at 21 cents to 17 cents.\r\n\r\n  Pine Bluff, Ark.—While the merchants here would like to buy from\r\n  some other than the Standard they cannot afford to take the risks of\r\n  loss. We have just had an example of one hundred barrels opposition\r\n  oil which was brought here, which had the effect of bringing\r\n  Waters-Pierce Oil Company’s oil down from 18 to 13 cents—one cent\r\n  less than cost of opposition, with refusal on their part to sell to\r\n  anyone that bought from other than their company.\r\n\r\n  Vicksburg, Miss.—The Chess Carley Company (Standard) is now offering\r\n  110° oil at nine cents to any and every one. Shall we meet their\r\n  prices? All they want is to get us out of the market, then they\r\n  would at once advance price of oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are but illustrations of the entire set of letters; prices dropped\r\nat once by Standard agents on the introduction of an independent oil. A\r\ntable offered to Congress in 1888, giving the extent of their cutting in\r\nthe Southwest, shows that it ranged from 14 to 220 per cent.\r\n\r\nEvery investigation made since shows that it is the touch of the\r\ncompetitor which brings down the price. For instance, in the cost and\r\nprofit sheet from a Standard ledger referred to above, there was one\r\nstation on the list at which oil was selling at a loss. On investigation\r\nthe writer found it to be a point at which an independent jobber had\r\nbeen trying to get a market. If one examines the tables of prices in the\r\nrecent report of the Industrial Commission, he finds that wherever there\r\nis a low price there is competition. Thus, at Indianapolis, the only\r\ntown in the state of Indiana reporting competition, the wholesale price\r\nof oil was 5½ cents, although forty out of the fifty-three Indiana towns\r\nreporting gave from 8 cents to 10½ cents as the wholesale price per\r\ngallon. (These prices included freight. Taking Indianapolis as a centre,\r\nthe local freight on oil to any point in Indiana is in no case over a\r\ncent.) In April, 1904, inquiry showed the same striking difference\r\nbetween prices in Indianapolis, where six independent companies are now\r\nestablished, and neighbouring towns to which competition has not as yet\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThe advent of an independent concern in Morristown, New Jersey, brought\r\ndown the price to grocers to 7½ cents and to housewives to 10, but in\r\nthe neighbouring towns of Elizabeth and Plainfield, where only the\r\nStandard is reported, the grocers pay 9 cents and the housewives 12 and\r\n11, respectively. In Akron, Ohio, where an independent company was\r\noperating at the time the investigation was made, oil was sold at\r\nwholesale at 5¾ cents; at Painesville, nearer Cleveland, the shipping\r\npoint, at 9¼ cents. In Richmond, Virginia, one dealer reported to the\r\ncommission a wholesale price of 5 cents, and added: “A cut rate between\r\noil companies; has been selling at 9 and 10 cents.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of April of 1904 150° oil was selling from tank-wagons in\r\nBaltimore, where there is competition, at 9 cents. In Washington, where\r\nthere is no competition, it sold at 10½ cents, and in Annapolis (no\r\ncompetition) at 11 cents. In Seaford, Delaware, the same oil sold at 8\r\ncents under competition. The freight rates are practically the same to\r\nall these points. And so one might go on indefinitely, showing how the\r\nintroduction of an independent oil has always reduced the price. As a\r\nrule, the appearance of the oil has led to a sharp contest or “Oil War,”\r\nat which, not infrequently, both sides have sold at a loss. The\r\nStandard, being able to stand a loss indefinitely, usually won out.\r\n\r\nAn interesting local “Oil War,” which occurred in 1896 and 1897 in New\r\nYork and Philadelphia, figured in the reports of the Industrial\r\nCommission, and illustrates very well the usual influence on Standard\r\nprices of the incoming of competition. On March 20, 1896, the Pure Oil\r\nCompany put three tank-wagons into New York City. The Standard’s price\r\nof water-white oil from tank-wagons that day was 9½ cents, and the Pure\r\nOil Company followed it. In less than a week the Standard had cut to 8\r\ncents[154] _along the route of the Pure Oil Company wagons_. In April\r\nthe price was cut to 7 cents. By December, 1896, it had fallen to 6\r\ncents; by December, 1897, to 5.4. It is true that crude oil was falling\r\nat this time, but the fall in water-white was out of all proportion.\r\nFor, while between the price of refined on March 20 and the average\r\nprice of refined in April along the Pure Oil Company route, there was a\r\nfall of 2½ cents, in crude there was a fall of but four-tenths of a\r\ncent. Refined fell from 7 cents in April to 6 cents in May, and crude\r\nfell one-tenth of a cent. John D. Archbold, in answering the figures\r\ngiven by the Pure Oil Company to the Industrial Commission, accused them\r\nof “carelessness,” and gave the average monthly price of crude and\r\nrefined to show that no such glaring discrepancy had taken place. Mr.\r\nArchbold gives the average price in March, for instance, as 7.98 and in\r\nApril as 7.31 cents. However, his price is the average to “all the trade\r\nof Greater New York and its vicinity,” whereas the prices of the Pure\r\nOil Company are those they met in their limited competition. As\r\nProfessor Jenks remarked at the examination: “It might easily be,\r\ntherefore, that your” (Standard) “average price would be what you had\r\ngiven, and that to a good many special customers with whom the Pure Oil\r\nCompany was trying to deal it could be five and a half cents.” That this\r\nwas the fact seems to be proved by the quotations for water-white oil\r\nfrom tank-wagons, which were published from week to week in trade\r\njournals like the Oil, Paint and Drug Reporter. These prices show 9⅞\r\ncents for water-white on March 21, and an average of 9.4 cents in April.\r\nEvidently only a part of the trade of “all Greater New York and\r\nvicinity” got the benefit of averages quoted to the Industrial\r\nCommission by Mr. Archbold.\r\n\r\nIf competition persists the result usually has been permanently lower\r\nprices than in territory where competition has been run out or has never\r\nentered. For instance, why should oil be sold to a dealer at nearly four\r\ncents more on an average in Kansas than in Kentucky, when the freight\r\nfrom Whiting to Kansas is only a cent more? For no reason except that in\r\nKentucky there has been persistent competition for twenty-five years,\r\nand in Kansas none has ever secured a solid foothold. Why should\r\nColorado pay an average of 16.90 cents for oil per gallon and California\r\n14.60 cents, when the freight from Whiting differs but one-tenth of one\r\ncent? For no reason except that a few years ago competition was driven\r\nfrom Colorado, and in California it still exists.\r\n\r\nIndeed, any consecutive study of the Standard Oil Company’s use of its\r\npower over the price of either export or domestic oil must lead to the\r\nconclusion that it has always been used to the fullest extent possible\r\nwithout jeopardising it; that we have always paid more for our refined\r\noil than we would have done if there had been free competition. But why\r\nshould we expect anything else? This is the chief object of\r\ncombinations. Certainly the candid members of the Standard Oil Company\r\nwould be the last men to argue that they give the public any more of the\r\nprofits they may get by combination than they can help. One of the\r\nablest and frankest of them, H. H. Rogers, when before the Industrial\r\nCommission in 1899, was asked how it happened that in twenty years the\r\nStandard Oil Company had never cheapened the cost of gathering and\r\ntransporting oil in pipe-lines by the least fraction of a cent; that it\r\ncost the oil producer just as much now as it did twenty years ago to get\r\nhis oil taken away from the wells and to transport it to New York. And\r\nMr. Rogers answered, with delightful candour: “We are not in business\r\nfor our health, but are out for the dollars.”\r\n\r\nJohn D. Archbold was asked at the same time if it were not true that, by\r\nvirtue of its great power, the Standard Oil Company was enabled to\r\nsecure prices that, on the whole, were above those under competition,\r\nand Mr. Archbold said: “Well, I hope so.”[155]\r\n\r\nBut these are frank answers, perhaps surprised out of the gentlemen. The\r\nable and wary president of the great concern, John D. Rockefeller, is\r\nmore cautious in his admissions. On the witness-stand in 1888 he was\r\nforced to admit, after some skilful evasion, that the control the\r\nStandard Oil Company had of prices was such that they could raise or\r\nlower them at will. “But,” added Mr. Rockefeller, “we would not do it.”\r\nThe whole colloquy between the examiner and Mr. Rockefeller is\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Isn’t it a fact that the nine trustees controlling the large\r\n  amount of capital which the Standard Oil Trust does could very\r\n  easily advance or depress the market price of oil if they saw\r\n  fit?...\r\n\r\n  _A._ I don’t think they would.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I don’t ask whether they would; could they do it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I suppose it would be possible for these gentlemen; if they\r\n  should buy enough oil, it would make the price go up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was considerable sparring, Mr. Rockefeller trying to explain away\r\nhis answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I can’t get you down to my question ... that is a very great\r\n  power to wield.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Certainly; an individual or a combination of men can advance\r\n  the price or more or less depress the price of any commodity.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But if you desire to increase—to put up the price of the\r\n  refined oil, or to put down the price of the crude oil, is it within\r\n  your power to do it, in the way I have indicated, by staying out of\r\n  the market or going into the market to purchase, controlling 75 per\r\n  cent. of the demand for the crude oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It would be a temporary effect, but that is all....\r\n\r\n  _Q._ By stopping the manufacture of refined oil your refineries\r\n  representing so large a proportion would tend to raise the price?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That is something we never do; our business is to increase all\r\n  the time, not to decrease.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Really your notion is that the Standard Oil Trust is a\r\n  beneficial organisation to the public?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I beg with all respect to present the record which shows that\r\n  it is.[156]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many of the world it is a matter of little moment, no doubt, whether\r\noil sells for eight or twelve cents a gallon. It becomes a tragic matter\r\nsometimes, however, as in 1902–1903 when, in the coal famine, the poor,\r\ndeprived of coal, depended on oil for heat. In January, 1903, oil was\r\nsold to dealers from tank-wagons in New York City at eleven cents a\r\ngallon. That oil cost the independent refiner, who paid full\r\ntransportation charges and marketed at the cost of a cent a gallon, not\r\nover 6.4 cents. It cost the Standard Oil Company probably a cent less.\r\nThat such a price could prevail under free competition is, of course,\r\nimpossible. Throughout the hard winter of 1902–1903 the price of refined\r\noil advanced. It was claimed that this was due to the advance in crude,\r\nbut in every case it was considerably more than that of crude. Indeed, a\r\ncareful comparative study of oil prices shows that the Standard almost\r\nalways advances the refined market a good many more points than it does\r\nthe crude market. The chart shows this. While this has been the rule,\r\nthere are exceptions, of course, as when a rate war is on. Thus, in the\r\nspring of 1904, the severe competition in England of the Shell\r\nTransportation Company and of Russian oil caused the Standard to drop\r\nexport refined considerably more than crude. But, as the chart shows,\r\ndomestic oil has been kept up.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Standard’s power over prices, not only does the\r\nconsumer pay more for oil where competition has not reached or has been\r\nkilled, but this power is used steadily and with consummate skill to\r\nmake it hard for men to compete in any branch of the oil business. This\r\nhistory has been but a rehearsal of the operations practised by the\r\nStandard Oil Company to get rid of competition. It was to get rid of\r\ncompetition that the South Improvement Company was formed. It was to get\r\nrid of competition that the oil-carrying railroads were bullied or\r\npersuaded or bribed into unjust discriminations. It was to get rid of\r\ncompetition that the Empire Transportation Company, one of the finest\r\ntransportation companies ever built up in this country, was wrested from\r\nthe hands of the men who had developed it. It was to get rid of\r\ncompetition that war was made on the Tidewater Pipe Line, the Crescent\r\nPipe Line, the United States Pipe Line, not to mention a number of\r\nsimilar smaller enterprises. It was to get rid of competition that the\r\nStandard’s spy system was built up, its oil wars instituted, all its\r\nperfect methods for making it hard for rivals to do business developed.\r\n\r\nThe most curious feature perhaps of this question of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany and the price of oil is that there are still people who believe\r\nthat the Standard has made oil cheap! Men look at this chart and recall\r\nthat back in the late sixties and seventies they paid fifty and sixty\r\ncents a gallon for oil, which now they pay twelve and fifteen cents for.\r\nThis, then, they say, is the result of the combination. Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhimself pointed out this great difference in prices. “In 1861,” he told\r\nthe New York Senate Committee, “oil sold for sixty-four cents a gallon,\r\nand now it is six and a quarter cents.” The comparison is as misleading\r\nas it was meant to be. In 1861 there was not a railway into the Oil\r\nRegions. It cost from three to ten dollars to get a barrel of oil to a\r\nshipping point. None of the appliances of transportation or storage had\r\nbeen devised. The process of refining was still crude, and there was\r\ngreat waste in the oil. Besides, the markets were undeveloped. Mr.\r\nRockefeller should have noted that oil fell from 61½ in 1861 to 25⅝ in\r\nthe year he first took hold of it, and that by his first successful\r\nmanipulation it went up to 30! He should point out what the successive\r\ndeclines in prices since that day are due to—to the seaboard pipe-lines,\r\nto the development of by-products, to bulk instead of barrel\r\ntransportation, to innumerable small economies. People who point to the\r\ndifferences in price, and call it combination, have never studied the\r\nprice-line history in hand. They do not know the meaning of the\r\nvariation of the line; that it was forced down from 1866 to 1876, when\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s first effective combination was secured by\r\ncompetition, and driven up in 1876 and 1877 by the stopping of\r\ncompetition; that it was driven down from 1877 to 1879 by the union of\r\nall sorts of competitive forces—producers, independent refiners, the\r\ndeveloping of an independent seaboard pipe-line—to a point lower than it\r\nhad ever been before. They forget that when these opposing forces were\r\novercome, and the Standard Oil Company was at last supreme, for ten\r\nyears oil never fell a point below the margin reached by competition in\r\n1879, though frequently it rose above that margin. They forget that in\r\n1889, when for the first time in ten years the margin between crude and\r\nrefined oil began to fall, it was the competition coming from the rise\r\nof American independent interests and the development of foreign oil\r\nfields that did it.\r\n\r\nTo believe that the Standard Oil Combination, or any other similar\r\naggregation, would lower prices except under the pressure of the\r\ncompetition they were trying to kill, argues an amazing gullibility.\r\nHuman experience long ago taught us that if we allowed a man or a group\r\nof men autocratic powers in government or church, they used that power\r\nto oppress and defraud the public. For centuries the struggle of the\r\nnations has been to obtain stable government, with fair play to the\r\nmasses. To obtain this we have hedged our kings and emperors and\r\npresidents about with a thousand constitutional restrictions. It has not\r\nbeen possible for us to allow even the church, inspired by religious\r\nideals, to have the full power it has demanded in society. And yet we\r\nhave here in the United States allowed men practically autocratic powers\r\nin commerce. We have allowed them special privileges in transportation,\r\nbound in no great length of time to kill their competitors, though the\r\nspirit of our laws and of the charters of the transportation lines\r\nforbade these privileges. We have allowed them to combine in great\r\ninterstate aggregations, for which we have provided no form of charter\r\nor of publicity, although human experience long ago decided that men\r\nunited in partnerships, companies, or corporations for business purposes\r\nmust have their powers defined and be subject to a reasonable inspection\r\nand publicity. As a natural result of these extraordinary powers, we\r\nsee, as in the case of the Standard Oil Company, the price of a\r\nnecessity of life within the control of a group of nine men, as able, as\r\nenergetic, and as ruthless in business operations as any nine men the\r\nworld has ever seen combined. They have exercised their power over\r\nprices with almost preternatural skill. It has been their most cruel\r\nweapon in stifling competition, a sure means of reaping usurious\r\ndividends, and, at the same time, a most persuasive argument in\r\nhoodwinking the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n          THE LEGITIMATE GREATNESS OF THE STANDARD OIL COMPANY\r\n\r\n  CENTRALISATION OF AUTHORITY—ROCKEFELLER AND EIGHT OTHER TRUSTEES\r\n    MANAGING THINGS LIKE PARTNERS IN A BUSINESS—NEWS-GATHERING\r\n    ORGANIZATION FOR COLLECTING ALL INFORMATION OF VALUE TO THE\r\n    TRUSTEES—ROCKEFELLER GETS PICKED MEN FOR EVERY POST AND CONTRIVES TO\r\n    MAKE THEM COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER—PLANTS WISELY LOCATED—THE SMALLEST\r\n    DETAILS IN EXPENSE LOOKED OUT FOR—QUICK ADAPTABILITY TO NEW\r\n    CONDITIONS AS THEY ARISE—ECONOMY INTRODUCED BY THE MANUFACTURE OF\r\n    SUPPLIES—A PROFIT PAID TO NOBODY—PROFITABLE EXTENSION OF PRODUCTS\r\n    AND BY-PRODUCTS—A GENERAL CAPACITY FOR SEEING BIG THINGS AND ENOUGH\r\n    DARING TO LAY HOLD OF THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there can be no doubt that the determining factor in the success\r\nof the Standard Oil Company in securing a practical monopoly of the oil\r\nindustry has been the special privileges it has enjoyed since the\r\nbeginning of its career, it is equally true that those privileges alone\r\nwill not account for its success. Something besides illegal advantages\r\nhas gone into the making of the Standard Oil Trust. Had it possessed\r\nonly the qualities which the general public has always attributed to it,\r\nits overthrow would have come before this. But this huge bulk, blackened\r\nby commercial sin, has always been strong in all great business\r\nqualities—in energy, in intelligence, in dauntlessness. It has always\r\nbeen rich in youth as well as greed, in brains as well as\r\nunscrupulousness. If it has played its great game with contemptuous\r\nindifference to fair play, and to nice legal points of view, it has\r\nplayed it with consummate ability, daring and address. The silent,\r\npatient, all-seeing man who has led it in its transportation raids has\r\nled it no less successfully in what may be called its legitimate work.\r\nNobody has appreciated more fully than he those qualities which alone\r\nmake for permanent stability and growth in commercial ventures. He has\r\ninsisted on these qualities, and it is because of this insistence that\r\nthe Standard Oil Trust has always been something besides a fine piece of\r\nbrigandage, with the fate of brigandage before it, that it has been a\r\nthing with life and future.\r\n\r\nIf one attempts to analyse what may be called the legitimate greatness\r\nof Mr. Rockefeller’s creation in distinction to its illegitimate\r\ngreatness, he will find at the foundation the fact that it is as\r\nperfectly centralised as the Catholic church or the Napoleonic\r\ngovernment. As was pointed out in a former chapter, the entire business\r\nwas placed in 1882 in the hands of nine trustees, of whom Mr.\r\nRockefeller was president. These trustees have always acted exactly as\r\nif they were nine partners in a business, and the only persons concerned\r\nin it. They met daily, giving their whole time to the management and\r\ndevelopment of the concern, as the partners in a dry-goods house would.\r\nAnything in the oil world might come under their ken, from a smoking\r\nwick in Oshkosh to the competition of Russian oil in China. Everything;\r\nbut nothing came unless it was necessary; for below them, and sifting\r\nthings for their eyes, were committees which dealt with the various\r\ndepartments of the business. There was a Crude Committee which\r\nconsidered the subject of crude oil, the world over; a Manufacturing\r\nCommittee which studied the making of refined, the utilisation of waste,\r\nthe development of new products; a Marketing Committee which considered\r\nthe markets. Before each of these committees was laid daily all the\r\ninformation to be found on earth concerning its particular field; not\r\nonly were there reports made to it of what was doing in its line in the\r\nStandard Oil Trust, but information came of everything connected with\r\nsuch work everywhere by everybody. These committees not only knew all\r\nabout their own business, they knew all about everybody else’s. The\r\nManufacturing Committee knew just what each of the feeble independent\r\nrefiners still existing was doing—what its resources and advantages\r\nwere; the Transportation Committee knew what rates it got; the Marketing\r\nCommittee knew its market. Thus the fullest information about new\r\ndevelopments of crude, new openings for refined, new processes of\r\nmanufacture, was always at the command of the nine trustees of the\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  S.

As the press does—by a wide-spreading\r\nsystem of reporters. In 1882 the Standard had correspondents in every\r\ntown in the oil fields, and to-day it has them not only there but in\r\nevery capital of the globe. It is a common enough thing, indeed, in\r\nEuropean capitals to run across high-class newspaper correspondents,\r\nconsuls, or business men who add to their incomes by private reporting\r\nto the Standard Oil Company. The people in their employ naturally report\r\nall they learn. There are also outsiders who report what they pick\r\nup—“occasional contributions.” There is more than one man in the Oil\r\nRegions who has made his livelihood for years by picking up information\r\nfor the Standard. “Spies,” they are called there. They may deserve the\r\nname sometimes, but the service may be perfectly legitimate.\r\n\r\nThese trustees then “know everything” about the oil business and they\r\nhave used their information. Nobody ever used information more\r\nprofitably. What was learned was applied, and affected the whole great\r\nstructure, for by a marvellous genius in organisation Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhad devised a machine with a head whose thinking was felt from the seat\r\nof power in New York City to the humblest pipe-line patrol on Oil Creek.\r\nThis head controlled each one of the scattered plants with absolute\r\nprecision. Take the refineries; they were individual plants, having a\r\nmanager and a board of directors like any outside plant, but these\r\nplants were not free agents. According to J. J. Vandergrift’s testimony\r\nin 1879, the Imperial Refinery, of which he was president, had no\r\ncontrol of its oil after it was made. The Standard Oil Company of\r\nCleveland took charge of it at Oil City, and arranged for transportation\r\nand for marketing. The managers of the Central Association, into which\r\nthe allied refiners went in 1875 under Mr. Rockefeller’s presidency, had\r\n“irrevocable authority to make all purchases of crude oil and sales of\r\nrefined oil,” as well as to “negotiate for all railroad and pipe-line\r\nfreights and transportation expenses” for each of the refineries. Each\r\nplant, of course, was limited as to the amount of oil it could make.\r\nThus, in 1876, when the Cleveland firm of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle\r\nwent into a running arrangement with Mr. Rockefeller on condition that\r\nhe get for them the same rebates he enjoyed, it was agreed that the firm\r\nshould manufacture only 85,000 barrels a year, though they had a\r\ncapacity of 180,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Rockefeller’s greatest achievements has been to bring men who\r\nhad built up their own factories and managed them to suit themselves to\r\nwork harmoniously under such limitations. As this history has shown, the\r\nfirst attempt to harness the refiners failed because they would not obey\r\nthe rules. No doubt the chief reason why they finally consented to them\r\nwas that only by so doing could they get transportation rates equally\r\nadvantageous to those of the Standard Oil Company; but, having consented\r\nand finding it profitable, they were kept in line by an ingenious system\r\nof competition which must have done much to satisfy their need of\r\nindividual effort and their pride in independent work. In the\r\ninvestigation of 1879, when the producers were trying to find out the\r\nreal nature of the Standard alliance, they were much puzzled by the\r\nsworn testimony of certain Standard men that the factories they\r\ncontrolled were competing, and competing hard, with the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Cleveland. How could this be? Being bitter in heart and\r\nreckless in tongue, the oil men denounced the statements as perjury, but\r\nthey were the literal truth. Each refinery in the alliance was required\r\nto make to Mr. Rockefeller each month a detailed statement of its\r\noperations. These statements were compared and the results made known.\r\nIf the Acme at Titusville had refined cheaper that month than any other\r\nmember of the alliance, the fact was made known. If this cheapness\r\ncontinued to show, the others were sent to study the Acme methods.\r\nWhenever an improvement showed, that improvement received credit, and\r\nthe others were sent to find the secret. The keenest rivalry\r\nresulted—every factory was on its mettle.\r\n\r\nThis supervision took account of the least detail. There is a story\r\noften told in the Oil Regions to illustrate the minuteness of the\r\nsupervision. In commenting as usual on the monthly “competitive\r\nstatements,” as they are called, Mr. Rockefeller called the attention of\r\na certain refiner to a discrepancy in his reports. It referred to\r\n_bungs_—articles worth about as much in a refinery as pins are in a\r\nhousehold. “Last month,” the comment ran, “you reported on hand 1,119\r\nbungs. Ten thousand were sent you at the beginning of this month. You\r\nhave used 9,527 this month. You report 1,012 on hand. What has become of\r\nthe other five hundred and eighty?” The writer has it on high authority\r\nthat the current version of this story is not true, but it reflects very\r\nwell the impression the Oil Regions have of the thoroughness of Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s supervision. The Oil Regions, which were notoriously\r\nextravagant in their business methods, resented this care and called it\r\nmeanness, but the Oil Regions were wrong and Mr. Rockefeller was right.\r\nTake care of the bungs and the barrels will take care of themselves, is\r\nas good a policy in a refinery as the old saw it paraphrases is in\r\nfinanciering.\r\n\r\nThere were other features of this revolutionary management which caused\r\ndeep resentment in the oil world. Chief among them was the dismantling\r\nor abandoning of plants which the Standard had “acquired,” and which it\r\nclaimed were so badly placed or so equipped that it did not pay to run\r\nthem. There was reason enough in many cases for dissatisfaction with the\r\nprocess of acquisition, but having acquired the refineries, the Standard\r\nshowed its wisdom in abandoning many of them. Take Pittsburg, for\r\ninstance. When Mr. Lockhart began to absorb his neighbours, in 1874,\r\nthere were some twenty-five plants in and around the town. They were of\r\nvarying capacity, from little ten-barrel stills of antiquated design and\r\nout-of-the-way location, to complete plants like the Citizens’, which\r\nMr. Tack described in Chapter V. But how could Mr. Lockhart manage these\r\nas they stood to good advantage? It might pay the owner of the little\r\nrefinery to run it, for he was his own stillman, his own pipe-fitter,\r\nhis own foreman, and did not expect large returns; but it would have\r\nbeen absurd for Mr. Lockhart to try to run it. He simply carted away any\r\navailable machinery, sold what he could for junk, and left the _débris_.\r\nNow, one of the most melancholy sights on earth is an abandoned oil\r\nrefinery; and it was the desolation of the picture, combined, as it\r\nalways was in the Oil Regions, with the history of the former owners,\r\nthat caused much of the outcry. It was a thing that the oil men could\r\nnot get over, largely because it was a sight always before their eyes.\r\n\r\nBitter as this policy was for those who had suffered by the Standard’s\r\ncampaigns, it was, of course, the only thing for the trust to do—indeed,\r\nthat was what it had been waging war on the independents for: that it\r\nmight shut them down and dismantle them, that there might be less oil\r\nmade and higher prices for what it made. This wisdom in locating\r\nfactories has continued to characterise the Standard operations. It\r\nworks only plants which pay, and it places its plants where they can be\r\noperated to the best advantage. Many fine examples of the relation of\r\nlocation in manufacturing to crude supply and to markets are to be seen\r\nin the Standard Oil Company plants to-day. For example, refined for\r\nforeign shipments is made at the seaboard, and the vessels which carry\r\nit are loaded at docks, as at the works at Bayonne, New Jersey. The cost\r\nof transportation from factory to ship, a large item in the old days, is\r\neliminated entirely. The Middle West market is now supplied almost\r\nentirely from the Standard factories at Whiting, Indiana, a town built\r\nby the Standard Oil Company for refining Ohio oil. Here 25,000 barrels\r\nof oil are refined daily, and from this central point distributed to the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nAll of the industries which have been grafted on to the refineries have\r\nalways been run with the same exact regard to minute economies. These\r\nindustries were numerous because of Mr. Rockefeller’s great principle,\r\n“pay a profit to nobody.” From his earliest ventures in combination he\r\nhad applied this principle. Mr. Blanchard’s explanation to the Hepburn\r\nCommission in 1879 of why the Standard had controlled the Erie’s yards\r\nat Weehawken since 1874, shows exactly Mr. Rockefeller’s point of\r\nview.[157] This policy of paying nobody a profit took Mr. Rockefeller\r\ninto the barrel business. In 1872, when Mr. Rockefeller became master of\r\nthe Cleveland oil business, the purchase of barrels was one of a\r\nrefiner’s heaviest expenses. In an estimate of the cost of producing a\r\ngallon of refined oil in 1873, made in the Oil City Derrick and accepted\r\nas correct by that paper, the cost of the barrel is put at four cents a\r\ngallon, which was more than the crude oil cost at that date. Even at\r\nfour cents a gallon barrels were hard to get, so great was the demand.\r\nIf a refiner could get his barrels back, of course there was a saving (a\r\nreturned barrel was estimated to be worth 2¾ cents), but the return\r\ncould not be counted on; empty barrels coming from Europe particularly,\r\nand consigned to Western shippers, were frequently seized in New York by\r\nEastern refiners. The need was held to justify the deed, like thieving\r\nin famine time. Fortunes were made in barrels, and dealers hearing of a\r\nbig supply in Europe have been known to charter a vessel and go for\r\nthem, and reap rich profits. In fact, a whole volume of commercial\r\ntragedy and comedy hangs around the oil barrel. Now it was to the\r\nbarrel—the “holy blue barrel”—that Mr. Rockefeller gave early attention.\r\nHe determined to make it himself. One of the earliest outside ventures\r\nof the Standard Oil Company in Cleveland was barrel works, and Mr.\r\nRockefeller was soon getting for two and a half cents what his rivals\r\npaid four for, though he was by no means the only refiner who\r\nmanufactured barrels in the early days—each factory aimed to add barrel\r\nworks as soon as able. The amount the Standard Oil Company saved on this\r\none item is evident when the extent of its business is considered. The\r\nyear before the trust was formed (1881) they manufactured 4,500,000\r\nbarrels, an average of about 15,000 a day. Since that time the barrel\r\nhas been gradually going out of the oil business, bulk transportation\r\ntaking its place very largely. Nevertheless, in 1901 the Standard Oil\r\nCompany manufactured about 3,000,000 new barrels. In the period since\r\nthey began the manufacture of barrels their factories have introduced\r\nsome small savings which in the aggregate amount to large sums. For\r\ninstance, they have improved the lap of the hoop—a small thing, but one\r\nwhich amounted in 1901 to something like $15,000. Some $50,000 a year\r\nwas saved by a slight increase in the size of the tankage. The Standard\r\nclaims that these economies are so small in themselves that it only pays\r\nto practise them where there is a large aggregate business.\r\n\r\nMore important than the barrel to-day, however, is the tin can—for it is\r\nin tin cans that all the enormous quantities of refined sent to tropical\r\nand Oriental countries must go to prevent deterioration—and nowhere does\r\nthe policy of economy which Mr. Rockefeller has worked out show better\r\nthan in one of the Standard canning works. In 1902 the writer visited\r\nthe largest of the Standard can factories, the Devoe, on the East River,\r\nLong Island City. It has a capacity of 70,000 five-gallon cans a day,\r\nand is probably the largest can factory in the world. At the entrance of\r\nthe place a man was sweeping up carefully the dirt on the floor and\r\nwheeling it away—not to be dumped in the river, however. The dirt was to\r\nbe sifted for tin filings and solder dust. At every step something was\r\nsaved. The Standard buys the tin for its cans in Wales, because it is\r\ncheaper. It would not be cheaper if it were not for a vagary in\r\nadministering the tariff by which the duty on tin plate is refunded if\r\nthe tin is made into receptacles to be exported. This clause was\r\nprobably made for the benefit of the Standard, it being the largest\r\nsingle consumer of tin plate in the United States. In 1901 the Standard\r\nOil Company imported over 60,000 tons of tin with a value of over\r\n$1,000,000. This tin comes in sheets packed in flat boxes, which are\r\nopened by throwing—it is quicker than opening by a hammer, and time is\r\nconsidered as valuable as tin filings. The empty boxes are sold by the\r\nhundred to the Long Island gardens for growing plants in, and the broken\r\ncovers are sold for kindling. The trimmings which result from shaping\r\nthe tin sheets for a can are gathered into bundles and sold to chemical\r\nworks or foundries. There is the same care taken with solder as with\r\ntin, the amount each workman uses being carefully gauged. The canning\r\nplants, like the refineries, compare their results monthly, and the\r\nlaurels go to the manager who has saved the most ounces of solder, the\r\nmost hours, the most footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe five-gallon can turned out at the Devoe is a marvel of evolution.\r\nThe present methods of manufacture are almost entirely the work of\r\nHerman Miller, known in Standard circles as the “father of the\r\nfive-gallon can”; and a fine type of the German inventor he is. The\r\nmachinery for making the can has been so developed that while, in 1865,\r\nwhen Mr. Miller began his work under Charles Pratt, one man and a boy\r\nsoldered 850 cans in a day, in 1880 three men made 8,000, and since 1893\r\nthree men have made 24,000. It is an actual fact that a tin can is made\r\nby Miller in just about the time it takes to walk from the point in the\r\nfactory where the sheets of tin are unloaded to the point where the\r\nfinished article is filled with oil.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a nice point in combination. Not far away from the canning\r\nworks, on Newtown Creek, is an oil refinery. This oil runs to the\r\ncanning works, and, as the new-made cans come down by a chute from the\r\nworks above, where they have just been finished, they are filled, twelve\r\nat a time, with the oil made a few miles away. The filling apparatus is\r\nadmirable. As the new-made cans come down the chute they are\r\ndistributed, twelve in a row, along one side of a turn-table. The\r\nturn-table is revolved, and the cans come directly under twelve\r\nmeasures, each holding five gallons of oil—a turn of a valve, and the\r\ncans are full. The table is turned a quarter, and while twelve more cans\r\nare filled and twelve fresh ones are distributed, four men with\r\nsoldering coppers put the caps on the first set. Another quarter turn,\r\nand men stand ready to take the cans from the filler, and while they do\r\nthis, twelve more are having caps put on, twelve are filling, and twelve\r\nare coming to their place from the chute. The cans are placed at once in\r\nwooden boxes standing ready, and, after a twenty-four-hour wait for\r\ndiscovering leaks, are nailed up and carted to a near-by door. This door\r\nopens on the river, and there at anchor by the side of the factory is a\r\nvessel chartered for South America or China or where not—waiting to\r\nreceive the cans which a little more than twenty-four hours before were\r\ntin sheets lying in flat boxes. It is a marvellous example of economy\r\nnot only in materials, but in time and in footsteps.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Rockefeller’s genius for detail, there went a sense of the big\r\nand vital factors in the oil business, and a daring in laying hold of\r\nthem which was very like military genius. He saw strategic points like a\r\nNapoleon, and he swooped on them with the suddenness of a Napoleon. This\r\nmaster ability has been fully illustrated already in this work. Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s capture of the Cleveland refineries in 1872 was as\r\ndazzling an achievement as it was a hateful one. The campaign by which\r\nthe Empire Transportation Company was wrested from the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, viewed simply as a piece of brigandage, was admirable. The man\r\nsaw what was necessary to his purpose, and he never hesitated before it.\r\nHis courage was steady—and his faith in his ideas unwavering. He simply\r\nknew that was the thing to do, and he went ahead with the serenity of\r\nthe man who knows.\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of the trust the demand for these qualities was\r\nconstant. For instance, the contract which the Standard signed with the\r\nproducers in February, 1880, pledged them to take care of a production\r\nof 65,000 barrels a day. When they signed this agreement there was above\r\nground nearly nine and one-half million barrels of oil. The production\r\nincreased at a frightful rate for four years. At the end of 1880 there\r\nwere stocks of over 17,000,000 above ground; in 1881, over 25,000,000;\r\n1882, over 34,000,000; 1883, over 35,000,000; and 1884, over 36,000,000,\r\nand the United Pipe Lines took care of this production—with the aid of\r\nthe producers, who built tanks neck and neck with them. In 1880 the\r\nStandard people averaged over one iron tank a day, the tanks holding\r\nfrom 25,000 to 35,000 barrels. There were not tank-builders enough in\r\nthe United States to do the work, and crews were brought from Canada and\r\nEngland. This, of course, called for an enormous expenditure of money,\r\nfor tanks cost from $7,000 to $10,000 apiece. Rich as the United Pipe\r\nLines were they were forced to borrow money in these years of excessive\r\nproduction, for they had to lay lines as well as build tanks. There were\r\nnearly 4,000 miles of pipe-line laid in the Bradford region alone from\r\n1878 to 1884, and these lines connected with upward of 20,000 wells.\r\n\r\nFrom the time it completed its pipe-line monopoly the Standard has\r\nfollowed oil wherever found. It has had to do it to keep its hold on the\r\nbusiness, and its courage never yet has faltered, though it has demanded\r\nsome extraordinary efforts. In 1891 a great deposit of oil was tapped in\r\nthe McDonald field of Southwestern Pennsylvania. The monthly production\r\nincreased from 50,000 barrels in June to 1,600,000 in December. It is an\r\nactual fact that in the McDonald field the United Pipe Lines increased\r\nthe daily capacity of 3,500 barrels, which they had at the beginning of\r\nJuly, to one of 26,000 barrels by the first of September, and by the\r\nfirst of December they could handle 90,000 barrels a day. If one\r\nconsiders what this means one sees that it compares favourably with the\r\ngreat ordnance and mobilising feats of the Civil War. To accomplish it,\r\nrolling mills and boiler shops in various cities worked night and day to\r\nturn out the pipe, the pumps, the engines, the boilers which were\r\nneeded. Transportation had to be arranged, crews of men obtained, a wild\r\ncountry prepared, sawmills to cut the quantities of timber needed built,\r\nand this vast amount of material placed and set to work.\r\n\r\nThe same audacity and effectiveness are shown by the Standard in\r\nattacking situations created by new developments in handling business.\r\nThe seaboard pipe-line is a notable example. When the Standard completed\r\nits pipe-line monopoly at the end of 1877, the pipe-line was still\r\nregarded as the feeder of the railroad. Naturally the railroads were\r\nseriously opposed to its becoming anything more. In Pennsylvania\r\nparticularly the laws had been so manipulated by the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad as to prevent the pipe-line carrying oil even for short\r\ndistances in competition with them. Now, for many years it had been\r\nbelieved that the pipe-line could carry oil long distances—many claimed\r\nto the seaboard—and as soon as the independents found that the\r\noil-bearing roads were acting solely in the interest of the Standard\r\nthey began an agitation for a seaboard line which finally terminated in\r\nthe Tidewater Line, one hundred and four miles long, carrying oil from\r\nthe Bradford field to Williamsport on the Reading Railroad, and it was\r\ncertain that the Tidewater eventually would get to the seaboard. That\r\nthe day of the railroad as a carrier of crude oil was over when the\r\nTidewater began to pump oil was obvious both to Mr. Rockefeller and to\r\nthe railroad presidents, and without hesitation he seized the idea. By\r\n1883 the Standard was pumping oil to New York, and the railroads that\r\nhad served so effectively in building up the trust were practically out\r\nof the crude business. It was this audacious and splendid stroke,\r\npractically freeing him from the railroads which had made him, which\r\nmade the passage of the Interstate Commerce Bill a matter of\r\ncomparatively small importance to Mr. Rockefeller. To be sure, he still\r\nneeded the railroads for refined, but he could so place his refineries\r\nthat this service would be greatly minimised. The legislation which the\r\nOil Regions of Pennsylvania demanded for fifteen years in hope of\r\nsecuring an equal chance in transportation came too late. By the time\r\nthe bill was passed the pipe had replaced the rail as the great oil\r\ncarrier, and the pipes were not merely under Mr. Rockefeller’s control,\r\nas the rails had been; they belonged to him. It was little wonder, then,\r\nthat the passage of the great bill did not ruffle his serenity. Little\r\nwonder that the Oil Regions, realising the situation, so tragic in its\r\nirony, as fully as Mr. Rockefeller did, felt an exasperation almost\r\nuncontrolled over it. Yet the seaboard pipe-line was no development of\r\nthe Standard Oil Company. The idea had been conceived and the\r\npracticability demonstrated by others, but it was seized by the Standard\r\nas soon as it proved possible. This quick sense of the real value of new\r\ndevelopments, and this alertness in seizing them, have been among the\r\nstrongest elements in the Standard’s success.\r\n\r\nAnd every new line of action was developed to its utmost. Take the work\r\nthe Standard began in 1879 on the foreign market. Before the Standard\r\nOil Company was known, save as one of several prosperous Cleveland\r\nrefineries, the foreign trade had been developed until petroleum was\r\n_fourth_ in our list of exports, and it went literally to every\r\ncivilised country on the globe. In 1874 Colonel Forney made a trip\r\nthrough the Orient, and he wrote in one of his letters that he found\r\nboth Babylon and Nineveh to be lighted with American petroleum, and that\r\nwhile he was in Damascus a census was taken to ascertain how much\r\npetroleum was needed for each house in the place, and a proposition was\r\nmade for its entire use. “At present,” said the Derrick, in commenting\r\non this letter, “petroleum is the chief commercial representative of the\r\nUnited States in the Levant and the Orient.”\r\n\r\nThe same dithyrambic paragraphs were written by oil men then, as by the\r\nStandard now, concerning foreign trade. For instance, compare the two\r\nparagraphs below—the one found in 1874 in the Derrick, the second in a\r\ndefence of the Oil Trust published in 1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1874—“It lights the dwellings, the temples, and the mosques amid the\r\n  ruins of ancient Babylon and Nineveh; it is the light of Bagdad, the\r\n  city of the Thousand and One Nights; of Orfa, birthplace of Abraham;\r\n  of Mardeen, the ancient _Macius_ of the Romans, and of Damascus, gem\r\n  of the Orient. It burns in the grotto of the Nativity at Bethlehem;\r\n  in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem; amidst the\r\n  Pyramids of Egypt; on the Acropolis of Athens; on the plains of\r\n  Troy; and in cottage and palace on the banks of the Bosporus and the\r\n  Golden Horn.”\r\n\r\n  1900—“Petroleum to-day is the light of the world. It is carried\r\n  wherever a wheel can roll or a camel’s hoof be planted. The caravans\r\n  on the desert of Sahara go laden with Pratt’s Astral, and elephants\r\n  in India carry cases of ‘Standard-white,’ while ships are constantly\r\n  loading at our wharves for Japan, Java and the most distant isles of\r\n  the sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\nExports grew rapidly through the same machinery which had created the\r\nforeign market. In 1870 there were something over one hundred and forty\r\nmillion gallons of petroleum products going abroad, in 1873 nearly two\r\nand one-half hundred million, in 1878 three and one-half hundred\r\nmillion. In 1870 the Standard began its work on the foreign trade by\r\nsending a representative abroad. Country after country seems to have\r\nbeen taken up, the idea being that the daily Standard Oil meeting should\r\nhave the same full information before it concerning every place of\r\nforeign trade as it had of the American trade, and that gradually the\r\ncompany should control the foreign trade as it did the American\r\nindustry, doing away with middlemen, “paying nobody a profit.” This\r\nwork, begun in 1879, has been carried on steadily ever since. Through it\r\nthe Standard soon became largely its own exporter. It established\r\nstations of its own in one port after another of Europe, Asia, South\r\nAmerica, and has built up a large oil fleet. It carried on an aggressive\r\ncampaign for developing markets; it looked after hostile legislation; it\r\nstudied the possible competition of native oils; it met every\r\ndifficulty—prejudice, ignorance, poverty. Little by little it has done\r\nin foreign countries what it has done in the United States. To-day it\r\neven carts oil from door to door in Germany and Portugal and other\r\ncountries, as it does in America, thus realising Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\nvision of controlling the petroleum of America from the time it leaves\r\nthe ground until it is put into the lamp of the consumer.\r\n\r\nThe same economy and alertness were applied to the matter of making\r\noils. In laying hands on the refineries of the country, Rockefeller had\r\nacquired by 1882 about all the processes of manufacturing known, both\r\npatented and free. These processes, including all the essential ones of\r\nto-day, had been developed entirely outside of the Standard Oil Company.\r\nAs early as 1865, the year Mr. Rockefeller went into the business,\r\nWilliam Wright wrote an exhaustive book on the Oil Regions of\r\nPennsylvania. Among other things, he reported quite fully what was being\r\ndone in the refining of petroleum. He found that in several factories\r\nthey were making naphtha, gasoline and benzine; that three grades of\r\nilluminating oils—“prime white,” “standard white” and “straw\r\ncolour”—were made everywhere; that paraffine, refined to a pure white\r\narticle like that of to-day, was manufactured in quantities by the\r\nDowner works; and that lubricating oils were beginning to be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM THE DISTILLATION OF CRUDE OIL IN A REFINERY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1872, the year that Mr. Rockefeller took things in hand, all of these\r\noriginal products had been greatly extended, as we have seen. Joshua\r\nMerrill had succeeded in deodorising lubricating oil, making it possible\r\nto put the petroleum lubricants on the foreign market, and in 1871 Mr.\r\nMerrill’s factory sold 50,000 gallons in England alone. By 1872\r\nparaffine wax was being made in many factories, and one maker of chewing\r\ngum in Maine used 70,000 pounds that year. The foreign trade in all the\r\nproducts of petroleum outside of illuminating oil was already\r\nconsiderable.[158] Many of the factories in making their oils gave them\r\nnames; thus, Pratt’s Astral was a name for a water-white oil made by the\r\nPratt works of Brooklyn. It was a high-grade oil, made exactly as the\r\noil made by many other refineries, but it had a name—a valuable one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM THE DISTILLATION OF CRUDE OIL IN LUBRICATING\r\n    WORKS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tables (pages 246–247) analysing the products of crude oil obtained\r\nto-day at the Standard factories show the results tabulated. Now all of\r\nthe products in these groups could be made in 1872, but certainly there\r\nwere not forty-six distinct products under the naphthas as the table\r\nshows—nor were there 174 refined distillates. In fact, these are not\r\nreally products; they are rather brands. Thus, though the table shows\r\ntwenty-nine different kinds of odorised or deodorised naphthas, the main\r\ndifference between them is their name. The 174 refined distillates are\r\nreally the different grades of illuminating oil which any factory can\r\nget, given the proper crude base, with a multitude of different names\r\napplied to catch the trade. Thus among these 174 “products” are\r\nthirty-three kinds of “Standard-white”[159] oil and forty-one kinds of\r\n“water-white”[160]—the principal difference between them being the\r\ndifferent fire tests at which they are put out. The real service of the\r\nStandard has been not this multiplication of so-called products, but in\r\nfinding processes by which a poor oil like the famous Lima oil could be\r\nrefined. In the case of the Lima oil the Standard claims it spent\r\nmillions of dollars before it solved the problem of its usefulness. The\r\namount of sulphur in the Lima or Ohio oil prevented its use as an\r\nilluminating oil, for the odour was intolerable, there was a\r\ndisagreeable smoke, and the wick charred rapidly. The problem of\r\ndeodorising it was attacked by many experimenters, and was finally\r\npractically solved by the Frasch process, which the Standard acquired\r\nafter spending a large amount of money in testing its efficacy. Probably\r\nsixty per cent. of the illuminating oil used in the United States now is\r\nmanufactured from an Ohio oil base.\r\n\r\nThis multiplication of varieties is, of course, a perfectly legitimate\r\nmerchandising device, but it is not a development of products, properly\r\nspeaking. Nor indeed was it for discoveries and inventions that the\r\nStandard Oil Trust was great in 1882, or that it is now—it is in the way\r\nit adapts and handles the discoveries and inventions it acquires. Take\r\nthe matter of lubricating oils. After a long struggle it gathered to\r\nitself the factories and the patents of lubricating oils, and it has\r\ndeveloped the trade amazingly; for, while in 1872 less than a half\r\nmillion gallons of petroleum lubricants were going abroad, in 1897 over\r\n50,000,000 gallons went. The extension of the lubricating trade was made\r\npossible largely by the discovery of Mr. Merrill referred to above. In\r\n1869 Mr. Merrill discovered a process by which a deodorised lubricating\r\noil could be made. He had both the apparatus for producing the oil and\r\nfor the oil itself patented. The oil was so favourably received that the\r\nmarket sale was several hundred per cent. greater in a single year than\r\nthe firm had ever sold before. Naturally, an attempt was made by other\r\nlubricating works to imitate Mr. Merrill’s new product. The most\r\nsuccessful imitation was made by Dr. S. D. Tweedle of Pittsburg. The oil\r\nhe put upon the market was considered an infringement by Mr. Merrill,\r\nwho commenced suit against the agents handling it. The case was before\r\nthe courts for some six years, and Mr. Merrill spent over $100,000 in\r\nmaintaining the patent. The case was finally decided in his favour by\r\nthe Supreme Court in Washington. During this suit the Standard Oil\r\nCompany stood behind Dr. Tweedle, furnishing the money to defend the\r\nsuit. When finally they were defeated they took a license under the new\r\npatent which Mr. Merrill was obliged to get out, and paid him a royalty\r\non the oil until within about a year and a half before the end of the\r\nlife of the patent, when they bought it outright for a large sum, Mr.\r\nMerrill reserving the right to manufacture and sell the oil without a\r\nroyalty. Most lubricating oils from petroleum are now made after Mr.\r\nMerrill’s process.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained control of the lubricating oils, the Standard showed the\r\ngreatest intelligence in studying the markets and in developing the\r\nproducts. It makes lubricants for every machine that works. It offers\r\nscores of cylinder oils, scores of spindle lubricants, of valve\r\nlubricants, of gas-engine lubricants, special brands for sewing\r\nmachines, for looms, for sole leather, for dynamos, for marine engines,\r\nfor everything that runs and works by steam power, by air, by\r\nelectricity, by gas, by man, or by beast power. Now any lubricating\r\nfactory can produce the six or eight primary lubricants. Given these,\r\nthe varieties to be produced by skilful compounding are infinite. They\r\ncan be made more or less viscous, flowing, heavy, light, according to\r\nthe needs of the machines and the idiosyncrasies of individuals who run\r\nthem. The man who runs a machine soon knows what oil suits him, and if\r\nhis trade is big enough an oil is put up especially for him with a name\r\nto tickle his vanity. It may be exactly like a dozen other oils on the\r\nmarket, but having its own name it is reckoned a new product. Skilful\r\ncompounders insist that they can duplicate any of the 833 lubricating\r\noils of the Standard if they can have samples. Of course this close\r\nstudy of the needs of a market, and this adaptation of one’s goods to\r\nthe requirements, are the highest sort of merchandising.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the great strength of the Standard Trust in 1882, when it\r\nwas founded as it is to-day, was the men who formed it. However sweeping\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s commercial vision, however steady his purpose, however\r\nremarkable his insight into what was essential to the realisation of his\r\nambition, he would have never gone far had he not drawn men into his\r\nconcern who understood what he was after and knew how to work for it.\r\nHis principle concerning men was laid down early. “We want only the big\r\nones, those who have already proved they can do a big business. As for\r\nthe others, unfortunately they will have to die.” The scheme had no\r\nprovision for mediocrity—nor for those who could not stomach his\r\nmethods. The men who in 1882 formed the Standard alliance were all from\r\nthe foremost rank in the petroleum trade, men who without question would\r\nbe among those at the top to-day if there had never been a Standard Oil\r\nCompany. In Pittsburg it was Charles Lockhart, a man interested in\r\npetroleum before the Drake well was struck, who had begun oil operations\r\non Oil Creek in March, 1860, who had carried samples of crude and\r\nrefined to Europe as early as May, 1860, who had built one of the first\r\nrefineries in Pittsburg, and who was easily the largest refiner there in\r\n1874 when Mr. Rockefeller bought him up. In Philadelphia, the largest\r\nrefiner in 1874 was W. G. Warden of the Atlantic Refining Company, and\r\nit was he whom Mr. Rockefeller wanted. In New York it was the concern of\r\nCharles Pratt and Company, one of the three largest concerns around\r\nManhattan—the concern to which H. H. Rogers belonged. Charles Pratt had\r\nbeen in the oil and paint business since 1850, and he had become a\r\nrefiner of petroleum at Greenpoint, Long Island, in 1867. Before\r\nStandard Oil was known outside of New York the fame of Pratt’s Astral\r\nOil had gone around the world. Mr. Pratt’s concern was rated at the same\r\ndaily capacity as Mr. Rockefeller’s (1,500 barrels) in the spring of\r\n1872, when the latter wiped up the Cleveland refineries and grew in a\r\nnight to 10,000 barrels. Mr. Vandergrift, who united his interests with\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s in 1874 and 1875, had been a far better known man in\r\nthe oil business and controlled much greater and more varied interests\r\nup to South Improvement times. When he went into the Standard he\r\ncontrolled the largest refinery on Oil Creek, the Imperial, of about\r\n1,400 barrels. He was president of a large system of pipe-lines, and he\r\nwas a member of one of the largest oil-producing concerns of the\r\ntime—the H. L. Taylor Company.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that Mr. Rockefeller had plenty of brains in his\r\ngreat trust. It was those who had done business with him who were the\r\nfirst to point this out when critics declared that the concern could\r\nnot—or must not—live. “There is no question about it,” W. H. Vanderbilt\r\ntold the Hepburn Commission in 1879, “but these men are smarter than I\r\nam a great deal. They are very enterprising and smart men. I never came\r\nin contact with any class of men as smart and able as they are in their\r\nbusiness. They would never have got into the position they now are\r\nwithout a great deal of ability—and one man would hardly have been able\r\nto do it; it is a combination of men.”\r\n\r\nIt was not only that first-rate ability was demanded at the top; it was\r\nrequired throughout the organisation. The very day-labourers were picked\r\nmen. It was the custom to offer a little better day wages for labourers\r\nthan was current and then to choose from these the most promising\r\nspecimens; those men were advanced as they showed ability. To-day the\r\nvery errand boys at 26 Broadway are chosen for the promise of\r\ndevelopment they show, and if they do not develop they are discharged.\r\nNo dead wood is taken into the concern unless it is through the supposed\r\nnecessities of family or business relations, as probably occurs to a\r\ndegree in every human organisation.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the working force of the Standard was greatly\r\nincreased when the trust was formed by the opportunity given to the\r\nemployees of taking stock. They were urged to do it, and where they had\r\nno savings money was lent them on easy terms by the company. The result\r\nis that a great number of the employees of the Standard Oil Company are\r\nowners of stock which they bought at eighty, and on which for several\r\nyears they have received from thirty to forty-eight per cent. dividends.\r\nIt is only natural that under such circumstances the company has always\r\na remarkably loyal and interested working force.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller’s great creation has really been strong, then, in many\r\nadmirable qualities. The force of the combination has been greater\r\nbecause of the business habits of the independent body which has opposed\r\nit. To the Standard’s caution the Oil Regions opposed recklessness; to\r\nits economy, extravagance; to its secretiveness, almost blatant\r\nfrankness; to its far-sightedness, little thought of the morrow; to its\r\nclose-fistedness, a spendthrift generosity; to its selfish\r\nunscrupulousness, an almost quixotic love of fair play. The Oil Regions\r\nhad, besides, one fatal weakness—its passion for speculation. Now, Mr.\r\nRockefeller never speculates. He deals only in those things which other\r\npeople have proved sure!\r\n\r\nIt is when one examines the inside of the Standard Oil Trust that one\r\nsees how much reason there is for the opinion of those people who\r\ndeclare that Mr. Rockefeller can always sustain the monopoly of the oil\r\nbusiness he has achieved. One begins to see what Mr. Vanderbilt meant in\r\n1879 when he said: “I don’t believe that by any legislative enactment or\r\nanything else, through any of the states or all of the states, you can\r\nkeep such men down. You can’t do it! They will be on top all the time,\r\nyou see if they are not.”[161] It is not surprising that those who\r\nrealise the compactness and harmony of the Standard organisation, the\r\nability of its members, the solidity of the qualities governing its\r\noperations, are willing to forget its history. Such is the blinding\r\nquality of success! “It has achieved this,” they say; “no matter what\r\nhelped to rear this structure, it is here, it is admirably managed. We\r\nmight as well accept it. We must do business.” They are weary of\r\ncontention, too—who so unwelcome as an agitator?—and they began to\r\naccept the Standard’s explanation that the critics are indeed “people\r\nwith a private grievance,” “mossbacks left behind in the march of\r\nprogress.” Again and again in the history of the oil business it has\r\nlooked to the outsider as if henceforth Mr. Rockefeller would have to\r\nhave things his own way, for who was there to interfere with him, to\r\ndispute his position? No one, save that back in Northwestern\r\nPennsylvania, in scrubby little oil towns, around greasy derricks, in\r\ndingy shanties, by rusty, deserted oil stills, men have always talked of\r\nthe iniquity of the railroad rebate, the injustice of restraint of\r\ntrade, the dangers of monopoly, the right to do an independent business;\r\nhave always rehearsed with tiresome persistency the evidence by which it\r\nhas been proved that the Standard Oil Company is a revival of the South\r\nImprovement Company. It has all seemed futile enough with the public\r\nlistening in wonder and awe to the splendid rehearsal of figures, and\r\nthe unctuous logic of the Mother of Trusts, and yet one can never tell.\r\nIt was the squawking of geese that saved the Capitol.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that many and great as are his business qualities, John D.\r\nRockefeller has never been allowed to enjoy the fruits of his victory in\r\nthat atmosphere of leisure and adulation which the victor naturally\r\ncraves. Certain it is that the incessant agitation of men with a\r\n“private grievance” has ruined some of his fairest schemes, has hauled\r\nhim again and again before investigating committees, and has contributed\r\ngreatly to securing a federal law authorising so fundamental and obvious\r\na right as equal rates on common carriers. Certain it is that the\r\nincessant efforts of those who believed they had a right to do an\r\nindependent business have resulted in the most important advances made\r\nin the oil business since the beginning of Mr. Rockefeller’s\r\ncombination, namely, the seaboard pipe-line, for transporting crude oil,\r\ndue to the Tidewater Pipe Line, and later the use of the seaboard\r\npipe-line for transporting refined oil, due to the United States Pipe\r\nLine. Certain it is, too, that all of competition which we have, with\r\nits consequent lowering of prices, is due to independent efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS BEGUN AGAINST THE STANDARD IN OHIO IN 1897 FOR\r\n    NOT OBEYING THE COURT’S ORDER OF 1892 TO DISSOLVE THE TRUST—SUITS\r\n    BEGUN TO OUST FOUR OF THE STANDARD’S CONSTITUENT COMPANIES FOR\r\n    VIOLATION OF OHIO ANTI-TRUST LAWS—ALL SUITS DROPPED BECAUSE OF\r\n    EXPIRATION OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL MONNETT’S TERM—STANDARD PERSUADED\r\n    THAT ITS ONLY CORPORATE REFUGE IS NEW JERSEY—CAPITAL OF THE STANDARD\r\n    OIL COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY INCREASED, AND ALL STANDARD OIL BUSINESS\r\n    TAKEN INTO NEW ORGANISATION—RESTRICTION OF NEW JERSEY LAW\r\n    SMALL—PROFITS ARE GREAT AND STANDARD’S CONTROL OF OIL BUSINESS IS\r\n    ALMOST ABSOLUTE—STANDARD OIL COMPANY ESSENTIALLY A REALISATION OF\r\n    THE SOUTH IMPROVEMENT COMPANY’S PLANS—THE CRUCIAL QUESTION NOW, AS\r\n    ALWAYS, IS A TRANSPORTATION QUESTION—THE TRUST QUESTION WILL GO\r\n    UNSOLVED SO LONG AS THE TRANSPORTATION QUESTION GOES UNSOLVED—THE\r\n    ETHICAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew men in either the political or industrial life of this country can\r\npoint to an achievement carried out in more exact accord with its first\r\nconception than John D. Rockefeller, for both in purpose and methods the\r\nStandard Oil Company is and always has been a form of the South\r\nImprovement Company, by which Mr. Rockefeller first attracted general\r\nattention in the oil industry. The original scheme has suffered many\r\nmodifications. Its most offensive feature, the drawback on other\r\npeople’s shipments, has been cut off. Nevertheless, to-day, as at the\r\nstart, the purpose of the Standard Oil Company is the purpose of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company—the regulation of the price of crude and\r\nrefined oil by the control of the output; and the chief means for\r\nsustaining this purpose is still that of the original scheme—a control\r\nof oil transportation giving special privileges in rates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\r\n\r\n  From a photograph by Allen Ayrault Green, taken about 1892.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is now thirty-two years since Mr. Rockefeller applied the fruitful\r\nidea of the South Improvement Company to the Standard Oil Company of\r\nOhio, a prosperous oil refinery of Cleveland, with a capital of\r\n$1,000,000 and a daily capacity for handling 1,500 barrels of crude oil.\r\nAnd what have we as a result? What is the Standard Oil Company to-day?\r\nFirst, what is its organisation? It is no longer a trust. As we have\r\nseen, the trust was obliged to liquidate in 1892. It became a “trust in\r\nliquidation,” and there it remained for some five years. It seemed to\r\nhave come into a state of stationary liquidation, for at the end of 1892\r\n477,881 shares were uncancelled; at the end of 1896 the same number were\r\nout. The situation of the great corporation was indeed curious. There\r\nbegan to be comments on it, for complications arose—one over taxes. In\r\n1893 an auditor in Ohio tried to collect taxes on 225 shares of the\r\nStandard Oil Trust. The owner refused to pay and took the case into\r\ncourt. He won it. The Standard Oil Trust is an unlawful organisation,\r\nsaid the court. Its certificates have no validity. It would seem strange\r\nthat a certificate which was void to all purpose would still be valid as\r\nto taxable purposes.[162] Here was an anomaly indeed. The certificates\r\nwere drawing big quarterly dividends, had a big market value, but were\r\nillegal. Owners of small certificates naturally refused to exchange. In\r\n1897 it took 194½ shares in the Standard Oil Trust to bring back one\r\nshare in each of the twenty companies. Thus one share in the Standard\r\nOil Company of Ohio was worth twenty-seven shares in the Standard Oil\r\nTrust. If a man owned twenty-five shares he got only fractional parts of\r\na share in each company. On these fractional parts he received no\r\ndividends, it not being considered practical to consider such small\r\nsums. To raise his twenty-five shares to 194, and so secure dividends,\r\ntook a good sum of money, since Standard Oil Trust shares were worth at\r\nleast 340 then. But why should he trouble? He received his quarterly\r\ndividends promptly, and they were large! He paid no taxes, for his stock\r\nwas illegal! The trustees were not pushing him to liquidate. Besides, it\r\nwas doubtful if they could do anything. Joseph Choate said they could\r\nnot. On May 3, 1894, before the attorney-general of New York, in an\r\napplication for the forfeiture of the charter of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of New York, Mr. Choate said:\r\n\r\n“I happen to own 100 shares in the Standard Oil Trust, and I have never\r\ngone forward and claimed my aliquot share. Why not? Because I would get\r\nten in one company, and ten in another company, and two and three-fifths\r\nin another company.\r\n\r\n“There is no power that this company can exercise to compel me and other\r\nindifferent certificate holders, if you please, to come forward and\r\nconvert our trust certificates.”\r\n\r\nIf there was a way, the trustees were indifferent to it. They evidently\r\nwere contented to let things alone. It is quite possible that they would\r\nhave been holding to-day 477,881 uncancelled shares of Standard Oil\r\nTrust if it had not been for the irrepressible George Rice. Since\r\nOctober, 1892, Mr. Rice had held a Standard Oil Trust certificate for\r\nsix shares. He had never cancelled it. He had received no invitation to\r\ndo so. He received his dividends regularly on it. Later, he purchased\r\none share, called “assignment of legal title”—the new form given the\r\ntrust certificate—and on this he received dividends, exactly as on the\r\noriginal trust certificate. Finally Mr. Rice made up his mind, without\r\nknowing any of the facts of the liquidation outlined above, that there\r\nwas no intention to carry out the dissolution, that some means of\r\nevasion had been devised, and he proposed to find out what it was.\r\n\r\nTo do this he transferred his assignment of legal title to an agent with\r\nthe order to liquidate it. A long correspondence followed between Mr.\r\nKemper, Mr. Rice’s agent, and Mr. Dodd, who objected to making the\r\ntransfer on the ground that it cut the share into a “multitude of almost\r\ninfinitesimal fractions of corporate shares.” They were obviating this\r\ndifficulty, Mr. Dodd said, by purchasing certificates calling for one or\r\na few shares and uniting them until sufficient were had by one party to\r\ncall for the issue of full corporate shares. Mr. Kemper insisted,\r\nhowever, and finally received scrip for his share. “Infinitesimal” it\r\nwas, indeed, 5,000/972,500 of one share in one company, 10,000/972,500\r\nof one share in another, and so on through nineteen constituent\r\ncompanies.[163]\r\n\r\nArguing from these experiences and what else he could gather, Mr. Rice\r\ndecided that the trust was not dissolved and had no intention of doing\r\nso. Furthermore, he argued that the scheme was one to entice the small\r\nshareholders to sell their shares and thus enable the trustees to\r\nincrease their holdings! And he sought legal counsel in Ohio as to the\r\npossibility of bringing suit against the Standard Oil Company of Ohio\r\nfor failing to obey the court’s orders in March, 1892. The attorneys,\r\none of whom was Mr. Watson, advised Mr. Rice to lay his facts before the\r\nattorney-general of the state, Frank S. Monnett. Like Mr. Watson, when\r\nhe brought his suit, Mr. Monnett was young and held firmly to the belief\r\nthat the business of an attorney-general is to enforce the laws. The\r\nfacts Mr. Rice and his counsel laid before him seemed to him to indicate\r\nthat the Standard Oil Company of Ohio had taken advantage of the\r\nleniency of the court in allowing it time to disentangle itself from the\r\ntrust, and had devised a skilful plan to evade the judgment pronounced\r\nagainst it five years before. He asked Mr. Rice and his attorneys to go\r\nwith him and lay the case before the judges of the Supreme Court in\r\nchambers, and ask if it did not justify proceedings against the company.\r\nThe judges agreed with the attorney-general and ordered him to bring the\r\ncompany before the court for contempt. Information was filed in\r\nNovember, 1897. The suit which followed proved one of the most\r\nsensational ever instituted against the Standard Oil Combination.\r\n\r\nThe first substantial point gained by the attorney-general in the\r\nproceedings was securing answers to a long series of questions\r\nconcerning the history of the operations of the Standard Oil Company of\r\nOhio, both within and without the trust. These answers were made by the\r\npresident of that company, who was at the same time the president of the\r\ntrust, John D. Rockefeller. They furnish a mass of facts of value and\r\ninterest, and they include the minutes of the meeting at which the trust\r\nwas dissolved on March 11, 1892, as well as the minutes of all the\r\nquarterly meetings the liquidating trustees held from 1892 to October,\r\n1897. It was from the information obtained from this set of questions\r\nthat Mr. Monnett secured proof that the liquidation scheme had been held\r\nup, as Mr. Rice claimed. The minutes showed, as related in Chapter XIV,\r\nthat from November, 1892, to March, 1896, 477,881 shares were reported\r\nevery three months to the trustees as uncancelled. In July, 1896, the\r\nnumber fell suddenly to 477,880. George Rice had succeeded in having his\r\nassignment of legal title liquidated! Mr. Monnett learned from the\r\nresult of this inquiry another suggestive fact, that while only one\r\nshare was cancelled in the five years _before_ the contempt proceedings\r\nwere brought, in the first three months _after_, 100,583 shares were\r\ncancelled![164]\r\n\r\nIt took Mr. Monnett some six months to secure the answers from Mr.\r\nRockefeller, but his information was still incomplete, and he asked the\r\ncourt to appoint a master commissioner, with power to examine the\r\nofficers, affairs and books of the Standard, to take testimony within or\r\nwithout the state, and to report. This was done, the commissioner\r\nholding his first court at the New Amsterdam Hotel, in New York, on\r\nOctober 11 and 12, 1898. Mr. Rockefeller was the only witness examined\r\nat the sessions, and his deliberation and self-control, his almost\r\ndetached attitude as a witness, were the subject of remark by more than\r\none observer. He answered no question promptly. He had the air of\r\nreflecting always before he spoke. He consulted frequently with his\r\ncounsel. His counsel, his colleagues who were present, the counsel of\r\nthe prosecution, were sometimes irate, never Mr. Rockefeller. From\r\nbeginning to end he was the soul of self-possession. His only sign of\r\nimpatience—if it was impatience—was an incessant slight tapping of the\r\narm of his chair with his white fingers.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this examination of Mr. Rockefeller was that Mr. Monnett\r\nand his colleagues called for those books of the trust which would show\r\nexactly how the original trust certificates had been liquidated. It was\r\nthen that the copies of the transfers of Mr. Rockefeller’s trust\r\ncertificates and of his assignments of legal title printed in the\r\nAppendix, Number 54, were obtained. Although Mr. Monnett had added to\r\nhis knowledge of the Standard’s operations between 1892 and 1898, he was\r\nnot yet convinced that the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was conducting\r\nits own business. He had found that, in spite of the order of the court\r\nin 1892, 13,593 shares of that company’s stock were still outstanding in\r\ntrust certificates. He knew these certificates drew dividends. Was the\r\ncompany paying money directly or indirectly to the liquidating trustees?\r\nThey said no, that they had been paying no dividends since 1892, that\r\nthe money paid the holders of trust certificates came from the other\r\nnineteen companies, that all their earnings had been used in improving\r\ntheir plant, or were invested in government bonds. Besides, said they,\r\nwe are not the thrifty concern we used to be. Mr. Monnett demanded proof\r\nfrom their books. The secretary of the company, on advice of his\r\ncounsel, Virgil P. Kline, refused to produce the books asked for, on the\r\nground that they would incriminate the company. The court supported Mr.\r\nMonnett, and ordered the company to produce those of their records\r\nshowing the gross earnings since 1892, and what had been done with them.\r\nThe order met with a second refusal.\r\n\r\nSuch was the status of the proceedings when Mr. Monnett received an\r\nanonymous communication stating that, about the time the company was\r\nordered by the court to produce its records, a great quantity of books\r\nhad been taken from the Standard’s office in Cleveland and burned. An\r\ninvestigation was at once made by the attorney-general, and a number of\r\nwitnesses examined. The fact of the burning of sixteen boxes of books\r\nfrom the Standard offices in Cleveland was established, but these books,\r\nthe officers of the company contended, were not the ones wanted by Mr.\r\nMonnett. “Then produce the ones we want,” ordered the court. But, on the\r\nground that such records might incriminate them, the officers still\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, the Standard Oil Company of Ohio was in a very tight\r\nplace, and it is difficult to see how an examination of their books\r\ncould have failed to incriminate not only it, but three other of the\r\nconstituent companies of the trust which held charters from the same\r\nstate. These three companies were the Ohio Oil Company, which produced\r\noil; the Buckeye Pipe Line, which transported it; and the Solar Refining\r\nCompany, which refined it. Mr. Monnett had learned enough about these\r\norganisations in the course of his investigations since November, 1897,\r\nto convince him that these companies—all of them enormously\r\nprofitable—were, for all practical purposes, one and the same\r\ncombination, and that they were all working with the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of Ohio, and that their operations were in direct violation of a\r\nstate anti-trust law recently passed. As soon as he had sufficient\r\nevidence he had filed petitions against all four of them. Now, these\r\npetitions were filed about the time he demanded the books showing the\r\nearnings of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, for use in his contempt\r\ncase. It was the old story of one suit being used as a shield in\r\nanother. A witness cannot be made to incriminate himself.\r\n\r\nThe reasons F. B. Squire, the secretary of the Standard Oil Company of\r\nOhio, gave for refusing to produce the books as ordered by the court\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1st. Because they are demanded in an action instituted against the\r\n  Standard Oil Company for contempt of court, and for the purpose of\r\n  proving said company guilty of contempt in order that the penalties\r\n  for contempt may be inflicted upon it and its officers; and I am\r\n  informed that, to enforce their production in such a case and for\r\n  such a purpose, is an unreasonable search and seizure.\r\n\r\n  2nd. Because the books disclose facts and circumstances which may be\r\n  used against the Standard Oil Company, tending to prove it guilty of\r\n  offences made criminal by an act of the Legislature of Ohio, passed\r\n  April 19, 1898, entitled “An Act to define trusts and to provide for\r\n  criminal penalties, civil damages, and the punishment of\r\n  corporations,” etc.\r\n\r\n  3rd. Because they disclose facts and circumstances which may be used\r\n  against myself personally as an officer of said company, tending to\r\n  prove me guilty of offences made criminal by the act aforesaid.[165]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the winter of 1898 and 1899, up to the end of March, when\r\nthe commission declared the taking of testimony closed, the wrangle over\r\nthe production of the books went on. Depositions had begun to be taken\r\nat the same time in the cases against the constituent companies for\r\nviolation of the anti-trust laws, and by the time the contempt case was\r\nclosed in March, 1899, the exasperation of both sides had reached fever\r\npitch. Nor did the judgment of the court quiet it, for three judges\r\nvoted for finding the company guilty of contempt, and three for clearing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUnsatisfactory as this was, Mr. Monnett still had his anti-trust suits,\r\nthrough which he expected and through which he did secure much further\r\nevidence that the four Standard companies in Ohio were practically one\r\nconcern so shrewdly and secretly handled that they were evading not only\r\nthe laws of the state, but that policy of all states which decrees that\r\nit is unsafe to allow men to work together in industrial combinations\r\nwithout charters defining their privileges, and subjecting them to\r\nreasonable examinations and publicity. Mr. Monnett’s work on these suits\r\ncame to an end with the expiration of his term in January, 1900, and the\r\nsuits were suppressed by his successor, John M. Sheets! Unfinished as\r\nthey were, they were of the greatest value in dragging into the light\r\ninformation concerning the methods and operations of the Standard Oil\r\nCombination to which the public has the right, and which it must digest\r\nif it is to succeed in working out a legal harness for combinations\r\nwhich, like the Standard, demand freedom to do what they like and do it\r\nsecretly.\r\n\r\nThe only refuge offered in the United States for the Standard Oil Trust\r\nin 1898, when the possibility arose by these suits of the state of Ohio\r\ntaking away the charters of four of its important constituent companies\r\nfor contempt of court and violation of the anti-trust laws of the state,\r\nlay in the corporation law of the state of New Jersey, which had just\r\nbeen amended, and here it settled. Among the twenty companies which\r\nformed the trust was the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, a\r\ncorporation for manufacturing and marketing petroleum products. Its\r\ncapital was $10,000,000. In June, 1899, this capital of $10,000,000 was\r\nincreased to one of $110,000,000, and into this new organisation was\r\ndumped the entire Standard aggregation. The old trust certificates\r\noutstanding and the assignments of legal title which had succeeded them\r\nwere called in, and for them were given common stock of the new Standard\r\nOil Company. The amount of this stock which had been issued, in January,\r\n1904, when the last report was made, was $97,448,800. Its market value\r\nat that date was $643,162,080. How it is divided is of course a matter\r\nof private concern. The number of stockholders in 1899 was about 3,500,\r\naccording to Mr. Archbold’s testimony to the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, but over one-half of the stock was owned by the directors,\r\nand probably nearly one-third was owned by Mr. Rockefeller himself.\r\n\r\nThe companies which this new Standard Oil Company has bought up with its\r\nstock are numerous and scattered. They consist of oil-producing\r\ncompanies like the South Penn Oil Company, the Ohio Oil Company, and the\r\nForest Oil Company; of transporting companies like the National Transit\r\nCompany, the Buckeye Pipe Line Company, the Indiana Pipe Line Company,\r\nand the Eureka Pipe Line Company; of manufacturing and marketing\r\ncompanies like the Atlantic Refining Company of Pennsylvania, and the\r\nStandard Oil Companies of many states—New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,\r\nIowa; of foreign marketing concerns like the Anglo-American Company. In\r\n1892 there were twenty of these constituent companies. There have been\r\nmany added since, in whole or part, like gas companies; new producing\r\nconcerns, made necessary by developments in California, Kansas and\r\nTexas; new marketing concerns for handling oil directly in Germany,\r\nItaly, Scandinavia and Portugal. What the total value of the companies\r\nowned by the present Standard Oil Company is it is impossible to say. In\r\n1892, when the trust was on trial in Ohio, it reported the aggregate\r\ncapital of its twenty companies as $102,233,700, and the appraised value\r\nwas given as $121,631,312.63; that is, there was an excess of about\r\n$19,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, when Attorney-General Monnett of Ohio had the Standard Oil\r\nCompany of the state on trial for contempt of court, he tried to find\r\nout from Mr. Rockefeller what the surplus of each of the various\r\ncompanies in the trust was at that date. Mr. Rockefeller answered: “I\r\nhave not in my possession or power data showing ... the amount of such\r\nsurplus money in their hands after the payment of the last dividends.”\r\nThen Mr. Rockefeller proceeded to repeat as the last he knew of the\r\nvalue of the holdings of the trust the list of values given six years\r\nbefore.[166] This list has continued to be cited ever since as\r\nauthoritative. There is a later one, whether Mr. Rockefeller had it in\r\nhis “possession or power,” or not, in 1898. It is the last trustworthy\r\nvaluation of which the writer knows, and is found in testimony taken in\r\n1899, in a private suit to which Mr. Rockefeller was party. It is for\r\nthe year 1896. This shows the “total capital and surplus” of the twenty\r\ncompanies to have been, on December 31 of that year, something over one\r\nhundred and forty-seven million dollars, nearly forty-nine millions of\r\nwhich was scheduled as “undivided profits.”[167] Of course there has\r\nbeen a constant increase in value since 1896.\r\n\r\nThe new Standard Oil Company is managed by a board of fourteen\r\ndirectors.[168] They probably collect the dividends of the constituent\r\ncompanies and divide them among stockholders in exactly the same way the\r\ntrustees of 1882 and the liquidating trustees of 1892 did. As for the\r\ncharter under which they are operating, never since the days of the\r\nSouth Improvement Company has Mr. Rockefeller held privileges so in\r\nharmony with his ambition. By it he can do all kinds of mining,\r\nmanufacturing, and trading business; transport goods and merchandise by\r\nland and water in any manner; buy, sell, lease, and improve lands; build\r\nhouses, structures, vessels, cars, wharves, docks, and piers; lay and\r\noperate pipe-lines; erect and operate telegraph and telephone lines, and\r\nlines for conducting electricity; enter into and carry out contracts of\r\nevery kind pertaining to his business; acquire, use, sell, and grant\r\nlicenses under patent rights; purchase, or otherwise acquire, hold,\r\nsell, assign, and transfer shares of capital stock and bonds or other\r\nevidences of indebtedness of corporations, and exercise all the\r\nprivileges of ownership, including voting upon the stocks so held; carry\r\non its business and have offices and agencies therefor in all parts of\r\nthe world, and hold, purchase, mortgage, and convey real estate and\r\npersonal property outside the state of New Jersey. These privileges are,\r\nof course, subject to the laws of the state or country in which the\r\ncompany operates. If it is contrary to the laws of a state for a foreign\r\ncorporation to hold real estate in its boundaries, a company must be\r\nchartered in the state. Its stock, of course, is sold to the New Jersey\r\ncorporation, so that it amounts to the same thing as far as the ability\r\nto do business is concerned. It will be seen that this really amounts to\r\na special charter allowing the holder not only to do all that is\r\nspecified, but to create whatever other power it desires, except\r\nbanking.[169] A comparison of this summary of powers with those granted\r\nby the South Improvement Company shows that in sweep of charter, at\r\nleast, the Standard Oil Company of to-day has as great power as its\r\nfamous progenitor.[170]\r\n\r\nThe profits of the present Standard Oil Company are enormous. For five\r\nyears the dividends have been averaging about forty-five million dollars\r\na year, or nearly fifty per cent. on its capitalisation, a sum which\r\ncapitalised at five per cent. would give $900,000,000. Of course this is\r\nnot all that the combination makes in a year. It allows an annual\r\naverage of 5.77 per cent. for deficit, and it carries always an ample\r\nreserve fund. When we remember that probably one-third of this immense\r\nannual revenue goes into the hands of John D. Rockefeller, that probably\r\nninety per cent. of it goes to the few men who make up the “Standard Oil\r\nfamily,” and that it must every year be invested, the Standard Oil\r\nCompany becomes a much more serious public matter than it was in 1872,\r\nwhen it stamped itself as willing to enter into a conspiracy to raid the\r\noil business—as a much more serious concern than in the years when it\r\nopenly made warfare of business, and drove from the oil industry by any\r\nmeans it could invent all who had the hardihood to enter it. For,\r\nconsider what must be done with the greater part of this $45,000,000. It\r\nmust be invested. The oil business does not demand it. There is plenty\r\nof reserve for all of its ventures. It must go into other industries.\r\nNaturally, the interests sought will be allied to oil. They will be gas,\r\nand we have the Standard Oil crowd steadily acquiring the gas interests\r\nof the country. They will be railroads, for on transportation all\r\nindustries depend, and, besides, railroads are one of the great\r\nconsumers of oil products and must be kept in line as buyers. And we\r\nhave the directors of the Standard Oil Company acting as directors on\r\nnearly all of the great railways of the country, the New York Central,\r\nNew York, New Haven and Hartford, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul, Union\r\nPacific, Northern Pacific, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western, Missouri\r\nPacific, Missouri, Kansas and Texas, Boston and Maine, and other lesser\r\nroads. They will go into copper, and we have the Amalgamated scheme.\r\nThey will go into steel, and we have Mr. Rockefeller’s enormous holdings\r\nin the Steel Trust. They will go into banking, and we have the National\r\nCity Bank and its allied institutions in New York City and Boston, as\r\nwell as a long chain running over the country. No one who has followed\r\nthis history can expect these holdings will be acquired on a rising\r\nmarket. Buy cheap and sell high is a rule of business, and when you\r\ncontrol enough money and enough banks you can always manage that a stock\r\nyou want shall be temporarily cheap. No value is destroyed for you—only\r\nfor the original owner. This has been one of Mr. Rockefeller’s most\r\nsuccessful manœuvres in doing business from the day he scared his twenty\r\nCleveland competitors until they sold to him at half price. You can also\r\nsell high, if you have a reputation of a great financier, and control of\r\nmoney and banks. Amalgamated Copper is an excellent example. The names\r\nof certain Standard Oil officials would float the most worthless\r\nproperty on earth a few years ago. It might be a little difficult for\r\nthem to do so to-day with Amalgamated so fresh in mind. Indeed,\r\nAmalgamated seems to-day to be the worst “break,” as it certainly was\r\none of the most outrageous performances of the Standard Oil crowd. But\r\nthat will soon be forgotten! The result is that the Standard Oil Company\r\nis probably in the strongest financial position of any aggregation in\r\nthe world. And every year its position grows stronger, for every year\r\nthere is pouring in another $45,000,000 to be used in wiping up the\r\nproperty most essential to preserving and broadening its power.\r\n\r\nAnd now what does the law of New Jersey require the concern which it has\r\nchartered, and which is so rapidly adding to its control of oil the\r\ncontrol of iron, steel, copper, banks, and railroads, to make known of\r\nitself? It must each year report its name, the location of its\r\nregistration office, with name of agent, the character of its business,\r\nthe amount of capital stock issued, and the names and addresses of its\r\nofficers and directors!\r\n\r\nSo much for present organisation, and now as to how far through this\r\norganisation the Standard Oil Company is able to realise the purpose for\r\nwhich it was organised—the control of the output, and, through that, the\r\nprice, of refined oil. That is, what per cent. of the whole oil business\r\ndoes Mr. Rockefeller’s concern control. First as to oil production. In\r\n1898 the Standard Oil Company reported to the Industrial Commission that\r\nit produced 35.58 per cent. of Eastern crude—the production that year\r\nwas about 52,000,000 barrels.[171] (It should be remembered that it is\r\nalways to the Eastern oil fields—Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, West\r\nVirginia—that this narrative refers. Texas, Kansas, Colorado and\r\nCalifornia are newer developments. These fields have not as yet been\r\ndetermining factors in the business, though Texas particularly has been\r\na distributing factor.) But while Mr. Rockefeller produces only about a\r\nthird of the entire production, he controls all but about ten per cent.\r\nof it; that is, all but about ten per cent. goes immediately into his\r\ncustody on coming from the wells. It passes entirely out of the hands of\r\nthe producers when the Standard pipe-line takes it. The oil is in Mr.\r\nRockefeller’s hands, and he, not the producer, can decide who is to have\r\nit. The greater portion of it he takes himself, of course, for he is the\r\nchief refiner of the country. In 1898 there were about twenty-four\r\nmillion barrels of petroleum products made in this country.[172] Of this\r\namount about twenty million were made by the Standard Oil Company; fully\r\na third of the balance was produced by the Tidewater Company, of which\r\nthe Standard holds a large minority stock, and which for twenty years\r\nhas had a running arrangement with the Standard. Reckoning out the\r\nTidewater’s probable output, and we have an independent output of about\r\n2,500,000 in twenty-four million. It is obvious that this great\r\npercentage of the business gives the Standard the control of prices.\r\nThis control can be kept in the domestic markets so long as the Standard\r\ncan keep under competition as successfully as it has in the past. It can\r\nbe kept in the foreign market as long as American oils can be made and\r\nsold in quantity cheaper than foreign oils. Until a decade ago the\r\nforeign market of American oils was not seriously threatened. Since\r\n1895, however, Russia, whose annual output of petroleum had been for a\r\nnumber of years about equal in volume to the American output, learned to\r\nmake a fairly decent product; more dangerous, she had learned to market.\r\nShe first appeared in Europe in 1885. It took ten years to make her a\r\nformidable rival, but she is so to-day, and, in spite of temporary\r\nalliances and combinations, it is very doubtful whether the Standard\r\nwill ever permanently control Russian oil.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Mr. Archbold presented to the Industrial Commission a most\r\ninteresting list of foreign corporations and individuals doing an oil\r\nbusiness in various countries. According to this there were more than a\r\nscore of large concerns in Russia, and many small ones. The aggregate\r\ncapitalisation shown by Mr. Archbold’s list was over forty-six and a\r\nhalf millions, and the capitalisation of a number of the concerns named\r\nwas not given. In Galicia, four companies, with an aggregate capital of\r\n$3,775,100, and in Roumania six large companies, with an aggregate\r\ncapital of $12,500,000, were reported. Borneo was shown to have nearly\r\nthree millions invested in the oil fields; Sumatra and Java each over\r\ntwelve millions. Since this report was made these companies have grown,\r\nparticularly in marketing ability. In the East the oil market belonged\r\npractically to the Standard Oil Company until recently. Last year\r\n(1903), however, Sumatra imported more oil into China than America, and\r\nRussia imported nearly half as much.[173] About 91,500,000 gallons of\r\nkerosene went into Calcutta last year, and of this only about six\r\nmillion gallons came from America. In Singapore representatives of\r\nSumatra oil claim that they have two-thirds of the trade.\r\n\r\nCombinations for offensive and defensive trade campaigns have also gone\r\non energetically among these various companies in the last few years.\r\nOne of the largest and most powerful of these aggregations now at work\r\nis in connection with an English shipping concern, the Shell Transport\r\nand Trading Company, the head of which is Sir Marcus Samuel, formerly\r\nLord Mayor of London. This company, which formerly traded almost\r\nentirely in Russian oil, undertook a few years ago to develop the oil\r\nfields in Borneo, and they built up a large Oriental trade. They soon\r\ncame into hot competition with the Royal Dutch Company, handling Sumatra\r\noil, and a war of prices ensued which lasted nearly two years. In 1903,\r\nhowever, the two competitors, in connection with four other strong\r\nSumatra and European companies, drew up an agreement in regard to\r\nmarkets which has put an end to their war. The “Shell” people have not\r\nonly these allies, but they have a contract with the Guffey Petroleum\r\nCompany, the largest Texas producing concern, to handle its output, and\r\nthey have gone into a German oil company, the Petroleum Produkten Aktien\r\nGesellschaft. Having thus provided themselves with a supply they have\r\nbegun developing a European trade on the same lines as their Oriental\r\ntrade, and they are making serious inroads on the Standard’s market.\r\n\r\nThe naphthas made from the Borneo oil have largely taken the place of\r\nAmerican naphtha in many parts of Europe. One load of Borneo benzine\r\neven made its appearance in the American market in 1904. It is a sign of\r\nwhat well may happen in the future with an intelligent development of\r\nthese Russian and Oriental oils—the Standard’s domestic market invaded.\r\nIt will be interesting to see to what further extent the American\r\ngovernment will protect the Standard Oil Company by tariff on foreign\r\noils if such a time does come. It has done very well already. The\r\naggressive marketing of the “Shell” and its allies in Europe has led to\r\na recent Oil War of great magnitude. For several months in 1904 American\r\nexport oil was sold at a lower price in New York than the crude oil it\r\ntakes to make it costs there. For instance, on August 13, 1904, the New\r\nYork export price was 4.80 cents per gallon for Standard-white in bulk.\r\nCrude sold at the well for $1.50 a barrel of forty-two gallons, and it\r\ncosts sixty cents to get it to seaboard by pipe-line; that is, forty-two\r\ngallons of crude oil costs $2.10, or five cents a gallon in New\r\nYork—twenty points loss on a gallon of the raw material! But this low\r\nprice for export affects the local market little or none. The tank-wagon\r\nprice keeps up to ten and eleven cents in New York. Of course crude is\r\ndepressed as much as possible to help carry this competition. For many\r\nmonths now there has been the abnormal situation of a declining crude\r\nprice in face of declining stocks. The truth is the Standard Oil Company\r\nis trying to meet the competition of the low-grade Oriental and Russian\r\noils with high-grade American oil—the crude being kept as low as\r\npossible, and the domestic market being made to pay for the foreign\r\ncutting. It seems a lack of foresight surprising in the Standard to have\r\nallowed itself to be found in such a dilemma. Certainly, for over two\r\nyears the company has been making every effort to escape by getting hold\r\nof a supply of low-grade oil which would enable it to meet the\r\ncompetition of the foreigner. There have been more or less short-lived\r\narrangements in Russia. An oil territory in Galicia was secured not long\r\nago by them, and an expert refiner with a full refining plant was sent\r\nover. Various hindrances have been met in the undertaking, and the works\r\nare not yet in operation. Two years ago the Standard attempted to get\r\nhold of the rich Burma oil fields. The press of India fought them out of\r\nthe country, and their weapon was the Standard Oil Company’s own record\r\nfor hard dealings! The Burma fields are in the hands of a monopoly of\r\nthe closest sort which has never properly developed the territory, but\r\nthe people and government prefer their own monopoly to one of the\r\nAmerican type!\r\n\r\nAltogether the most important question concerning the Standard Oil\r\nCompany to-day is how far it is sustaining its power by the employment\r\nof the peculiar methods of the South Improvement Company. It should\r\nnever be forgotten that Mr. Rockefeller never depended on these methods\r\nalone for securing power in the oil trade. From the beginning the\r\nStandard Oil Company has studied thoroughly everything connected with\r\nthe oil business. It has known, not guessed at conditions. It has had a\r\nkeen authoritative sight. It has applied itself to its tasks with\r\nindefatigable zeal. It has been as courageous as it has been cautious.\r\nNothing has been too big to undertake, as nothing has been too small to\r\nneglect. These facts have been repeatedly pointed out in this narrative.\r\nBut these are the American industrial qualities. They are common enough\r\nin all sorts of business. They have made our railroads, built up our\r\ngreat department stores, opened our mines. The Standard Oil Company has\r\nno monopoly in business ability. It is the thing for which American men\r\nare distinguished to-day in the world.\r\n\r\nThese qualities alone would have made a great business, and\r\nunquestionably it would have been along the line of combination, for\r\nwhen Mr. Rockefeller undertook to work out the good of the oil business\r\nthe tendency to combination was marked throughout the industry, but it\r\nwould not have been the combination whose history we have traced. To the\r\nhelp of these qualities Mr. Rockefeller proposed to bring the peculiar\r\naids of the South Improvement Company. He secured an alliance with the\r\nrailroads to drive out rivals. For fifteen years he received rebates of\r\nvarying amounts on at least the greater part of his shipments, and for\r\nat least a portion of that time he collected drawbacks of the oil other\r\npeople shipped; at the same time he worked with the railroads to prevent\r\nother people getting oil to manufacture, or if they got it he worked\r\nwith the railroads to prevent the shipment of the product. If it reached\r\na dealer, he did his utmost to bully or wheedle him to countermand his\r\norder. If he failed in that, he undersold until the dealer, losing on\r\nhis purchase, was glad enough to buy thereafter of Mr. Rockefeller. How\r\nmuch of this system remains in force to-day? The spying on independent\r\nshipments, the effort to have orders countermanded, the predatory\r\ncompetition prevailing, are well enough known. Contemporaneous\r\ndocuments, showing how these practices have been worked into a very\r\nperfect and practically universal system, have already been printed in\r\nthis work.[174] As for the rebates and drawbacks, if they do not exist\r\nin the forms practised up to 1887, as the Standard officials have\r\nrepeatedly declared, it is not saying that the Standard enjoys no\r\nspecial transportation privileges. As has been pointed out, it controls\r\nthe great pipe-line handling all but perhaps ten per cent. of the oil\r\nproduced in the Eastern fields. This system is fully 35,000 miles long.\r\nIt goes to the wells of every producer, gathers his oil into its storage\r\ntanks, and from there transports it to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New\r\nYork, Chicago, Buffalo, Cleveland, or any other refining point where it\r\nis needed. This pipe-line is a common carrier by virtue of its use of\r\nthe right of eminent domain, and, as a common carrier, is theoretically\r\nobliged to carry and deliver the oil of all comers, but in practice this\r\ndoes not always work. It has happened more than once in the history of\r\nthe Standard pipes that they have refused to gather or deliver oil.\r\nPipes have been taken up from wells belonging to individuals running or\r\nworking with independent refiners. Oil has been refused delivery at\r\npoints practical for independent refiners. For many years the supply of\r\noil has been so great that the Standard could not refuse oil to the\r\nindependent refiner on the ground of scarcity. However, a shortage in\r\nPennsylvania oil occurred in 1903. A very interesting situation arose as\r\na result. There are in Ohio and Pennsylvania several independent\r\nrefiners who, for a number of years, have depended on the Standard lines\r\n(the National Transit Company) for their supply of crude. In the fall of\r\n1903 these refiners were informed that thereafter the Standard could\r\nfurnish them with only fifty per cent. of their refining capacity. It\r\nwas a serious matter to the independents, who had their own markets, and\r\nsome of whom were increasing their plants. Supposing we buy oil directly\r\nfrom the producers, they asked one another, must not the Standard as a\r\ncommon carrier gather and deliver it? The experienced in the business\r\nsaid: “Yes. But what will happen? The producer rash enough to sell you\r\noil may be cut off by the National Transit Company. Of course, if he\r\nwants to fight in the courts he may eventually force the Standard to\r\nreconnect, but they could delay the suit until he was ruined. Also, if\r\nyou go over Mr. Seep’s head”—Mr. Seep is the Standard Oil buyer, and all\r\noil going into the National Transit system goes through his hands—“you\r\nwill antagonise him.” Now, “antagonize” in Standard circles may mean a\r\nvariety of things. The independent refiners decided to compromise, and\r\nan agreement terminable by either party at short notice was made between\r\nthem and the Standard, by which the members of the former were each to\r\nhave eighty per cent. of their capacity of crude oil, and were to give\r\nto the Standard all of their export oil to market. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe Standard’s ability to cut off crude supplies from the outside\r\nrefiners is much greater than in the days before the Interstate Commerce\r\nBill, when it depended on its alliance with the railroads to prevent its\r\nrival getting oil. It goes without saying that this is an absurd power\r\nto allow in the hands of any manufacturer of a great necessity of life.\r\nIt is exactly as if one corporation aiming at manufacturing all the\r\nflour of the country owned all but ten per cent. of the entire railroad\r\nsystem collecting and transporting wheat. They could, of course, in time\r\nof shortage, prevent any would-be competitor from getting grain to\r\ngrind, and they could and would make it difficult and expensive at all\r\ntimes for him to get it.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the power of the Standard to cut off outsiders from\r\nit, it is able to keep up transportation prices. Mr. Rockefeller owns\r\nthe pipe system—a common carrier—and the refineries of the Standard Oil\r\nCompany pay in the final accounting cost for transporting their oil,\r\nwhile outsiders pay just what they paid twenty-five years ago. There are\r\nlawyers who believe that if this condition were tested in the courts,\r\nthe National Transit Company would be obliged to give the same rates to\r\nothers as the Standard refineries ultimately pay. It would be\r\ninteresting to see the attempt made.\r\n\r\nNot only are outside refiners at just as great disadvantage in securing\r\ncrude supply to-day as before the Interstate Commerce Commission was\r\nformed; they still suffer severe discrimination on the railroads in\r\nmarketing their product. There are many ways of doing things. What but\r\ndiscrimination is the situation which exists in the comparative rates\r\nfor oil freight between Chicago and New Orleans, and Cleveland and New\r\nOrleans? All, or nearly all, of the refined oil sold by the Standard Oil\r\nCompany through the Mississippi Valley and the West is manufactured at\r\nWhiting, Indiana, close to Chicago, and is shipped on Chicago rates.\r\nThere are no important independent oil works at Chicago. Now at\r\nCleveland, Ohio, there are independent refiners and jobbers contending\r\nfor the market of the Mississippi Valley. See how prettily it is\r\nmanaged. The rates between the two Northern cities and New Orleans in\r\nthe case of nearly all commodities is about two cents per hundred pounds\r\nin favour of Chicago. For example, the rate on flour from Chicago is 23\r\ncents per 100 pounds; from Cleveland, 25 cents per 100 pounds; on canned\r\ngoods the rates are 33 and 35; on lumber, 31 and 33; on meats, 51 and\r\n54; on all sorts of iron and steel, 26 and 29; but on petroleum and its\r\nproducts they are 23 and 33!\r\n\r\nIn the case of Atlanta, Georgia, a similar vagary of rates exists. Thus\r\nCleveland has, as a rule, about two cents advantage per 100 pounds over\r\nChicago. Flour is shipped from Chicago to Atlanta at 34 cents, and from\r\nCleveland at 32½; lumber at 32 and 28½; but Cleveland refiners actually\r\npay 48 cents to Atlanta, while the Standard only pays 45 from Whiting.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious rule in the Boston and Maine Railroad in regard to\r\npetroleum shipments. On all commodities except petroleum, what is known\r\nas the Boston rate applies, but oil does not get this. For instance, the\r\nBoston rate applies to Salem, Massachusetts, on all traffic except\r\npetroleum, and that pays four cents more per 100 pounds to Salem than to\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nThe New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad gives no through rates on\r\npetroleum from Western points, although it gives them on every other\r\ncommodity. It does not refuse to take oil, but it charges the Boston\r\nrate plus the local rates. Thus, to use an illustration given by Mr.\r\nProuty, of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in a recent article, if a\r\nCleveland refiner sends into the New Haven territory, say to New Haven,\r\na car-load of oil, he pays 24 cents per 100 pounds to Boston and the\r\nlocal rate of 12 cents from Boston to New Haven. On any other commodity\r\nhe would pay the Boston rate. Besides, the rates on petroleum have been\r\nmaterially advanced over what they were when the Interstate Commerce\r\nBill was passed in 1887, although on other commodities they have fallen.\r\nIn 1887 grain was shipped from Cleveland to Boston for 22 cents, iron\r\nfor 22, petroleum for 22. In 1889 the rate on grain was 15 cents, on\r\niron 20 cents, and on petroleum 24. Of course it may be merely a\r\ncoincidence that the New Haven territory can be supplied by the Standard\r\nOil Company from its New York refineries by barge, and that William\r\nRockefeller is a director of the New York, New Haven and Hartford\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\nAn independent refiner of Titusville, Pennsylvania, T. B. Westgate, told\r\nthe Industrial Commission in 1898 that his concern was barred from\r\nshipping their products to nearly all New England and Canadian points by\r\nthe refusal of the roads to give the same advantages in tariff which\r\nother freight was allowed. Mr. Westgate made the suggestive comment that\r\nvery few railroads ever solicited oil trade. He pointed out that when\r\nthe United States Pipe Line was building, agents of various roads were\r\nafter the oil men soliciting shipments of the pipe, etc., to be used.\r\n“We could ship iron, but the oil—we must not handle. That is probably\r\nthe password that goes over.”\r\n\r\nExamples of this manipulation might be multiplied. There is no\r\nindependent refiner or jobber who tries to ship oil freight that does\r\nnot meet incessant discouragement and discrimination. Not only are rates\r\nmade to favour the Standard refining points and to protect their\r\nmarkets, but switching charges and dock charges are multiplied. Loading\r\nand unloading facilities are refused, payment of freights on small\r\nquantities are demanded in advance, a score of different ways are found\r\nto make hard the way of the outsider. “If I get a barrel of oil out of\r\nBuffalo,” an independent dealer told the writer not long ago, “I have to\r\n_sneak_ it out. There are no public docks; the railroads control most of\r\nthem, and they won’t let me out if they can help it. If I want to ship a\r\ncar-load they won’t take it if they can help it. They are all afraid of\r\noffending the Standard Oil Company.”\r\n\r\nThis may be a rather sweeping statement, but there is too much truth in\r\nit. There is no doubt that to-day, as before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, a community of interests exists between railroads and the\r\nStandard Oil Company sufficiently strong for the latter to get any help\r\nit wants in making it hard for rivals to do business. The Standard owns\r\nstock in most of the great systems. It is represented on the board of\r\ndirectors of nearly all the great systems, and it has an immense freight\r\nnot only in oil products, but in timber, iron, acids, and all of the\r\nnecessities of its factories. It is allied with many other industries,\r\niron, steel, and copper, and can swing freight away from a road which\r\ndoes not oblige it. It has great influence in the money market and can\r\nhelp or hinder a road in securing money. It has great influence in the\r\nstock market and can depress or inflate a stock if it sets about it.\r\nLittle wonder that the railroads, being what they are, are afraid to\r\n“disturb their relations with the Standard Oil Company,” or that they\r\nkeep alive a system of discriminations the same in effect as those which\r\nexisted before 1887.\r\n\r\nOf course such cases as those cited above are fit for the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, but the oil men as a body have no faith in the\r\neffectiveness of an appeal to the Commission, and in this feeling they\r\ndo not reflect on the Commission, but rather on the ignorance and\r\ntimidity of the Congress which, after creating a body which the people\r\ndemanded, made it helpless. The case on which the Oil Regions rests its\r\nreason for its opinion has already been referred to in the chapter on\r\nthe co-operative independent movement which finally resulted in the Pure\r\nOil Company. The case first came before the Commission in 1888. At that\r\ntime there was a small group of independent refiners in Oil City and\r\nTitusville, who were the direct outgrowth of the compromise of 1880\r\nbetween the Producers’ Protective Association and the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad. The railroad, having promised open rates to all, urged the men\r\nto go into business. Soon after came the great fight between the\r\nrailroads and the seaboard pipe-line, with the consequent low rates.\r\nThis warfare finally ended in 1884, after the Standard had brought the\r\nTidewater into line, in a pooling arrangement between the Standard, now\r\ncontrolling all seaboard pipe-lines, and the Pennsylvania Railroad, by\r\nwhich the latter was guaranteed twenty-six per cent. of all Eastern oil\r\nshipments on condition that they keep up the rate to the seaboard to\r\nfifty-two cents a barrel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A 25,000–BARREL TANK OF OIL IN FLAMES\r\n]\r\n\r\nNow, most of the independents shipped by barrels loaded on rack cars.\r\nThe Standard shipped almost entirely by tank-cars. The custom had always\r\nbeen in the Oil Regions to charge the same for shipments whether by tank\r\nor barrel. Suddenly, in 1888, the rate of fifty-two cents on oil in\r\nbarrels was raised to one of sixty-six cents. The independents believed\r\nthat the raise was a manipulation of the Standard intended to kill their\r\nexport trade, and they appealed to the Commission. They pointed out that\r\nthe railroads and the pipe-lines had been keeping up rates for a long\r\ntime by a pooling arrangement, and that now the roads made an\r\nunreasonable tariff on oil in barrels, at the same time refusing them\r\ntank cars. The hearing took place in Titusville in May, 1889. The\r\nrailroads argued that they had advanced the rate on barrelled oil\r\nbecause of a decision of the Commission itself—a case of very evident\r\ndiscrimination in favour of barrels. The Commission, however, argued\r\nthat each case brought before it must stand on its own merits, so\r\ndifferent were conditions and practices, and in December, 1892, it gave\r\nits decision. The pooling arrangement it did not touch, on the ground\r\nthat the Commission had authority only over railroads in competition,\r\nnot over railroads and pipe-lines in competition. The chief complaint,\r\nthat the new rate of sixty-six cents on oil in barrels and not on oil in\r\ntanks was an injurious discrimination, the Commission found justified.\r\nIt ordered that the railroads make the rates the same on oil in both\r\ntanks and barrels, and that they furnish shippers tanks whenever\r\nreasonable notice was given. As the amounts wrongfully collected by the\r\nrailroads from the refiners could not be ascertained from the evidence\r\nalready taken, the Commission decided to hold another hearing and fix\r\nthe amounts. This was not done until May, 1894, five years after the\r\nfirst hearing. Reparation was ordered to at least eleven different\r\nfirms, some of the sums amounting to several thousand dollars; the\r\nentire award ordered amounted to nearly $100,000.\r\n\r\nIn case the railroads failed to adjust the claims the refiners were\r\nordered to proceed to enforce them in the courts. The Commission found\r\nat this hearing that none of their orders of 1892 had been followed by\r\nthe roads and they were all repeated. As was to be expected, the roads\r\nrefused to recognise the claims allowed by the Commission, and the case\r\nwas taken by the refiners into court. It has been heard three times.\r\nTwice they have won, but each time an appeal of the roads has forced\r\nthem to appear again. The case was last heard at Philadelphia in\r\nFebruary, 1904, in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. No\r\ndecision had been rendered at this writing.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to offer direct and conclusive proof that the\r\nStandard Oil Company persuaded or forced the roads to the change of\r\npolicy complained of in this case, but the presence of their leading\r\nofficials and counsel at the hearings, the number of witnesses furnished\r\nfrom their employ, the statement of President Roberts of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad that the raise on barrelled oil was insisted on by\r\nthe seaboard refiners (the Standard was then practically the only\r\nseaboard refiner), as well as the perfectly well-known relations of the\r\nrailroad and the Standard, left no doubt in the minds of those who knew\r\nthe situation that the order originated with them, and that its sole\r\npurpose was harassing their competitors. The Commission seems to have\r\nhad no doubt of this. But see the helplessness of the Commission. It\r\ntakes full testimony in 1889, digests it carefully, gives its orders in\r\n1892, and they are not obeyed. More hearings follow, and in 1895 the\r\norders are repeated and reparation is allowed to the injured refiners.\r\nFrom that time to this the case passes from court to court, the railroad\r\nseeking to escape the Commission’s orders. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission was instituted to facilitate justice in this matter of\r\ntransportation, and yet here we have still unsettled a case on which\r\nthey gave their judgment twelve years ago. The lawyer who took the first\r\nappeal to the Commission, that of Rice, Robinson and Winthrop, of\r\nTitusville, M. J. Heywang, of Titusville, has been continually engaged\r\nin the case for sixteen years!\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the crucial question is\r\nstill a transportation question. Until the people of the United States\r\nhave solved the question of free and equal transportation it is idle to\r\nsuppose that they will not have a trust question. So long as it is\r\npossible for a company to own the exclusive carrier on which a great\r\nnatural product depends for transportation, and to use this carrier to\r\nlimit a competitor’s supply or to cut off that supply entirely if the\r\nrival is offensive, and always to make him pay a higher rate than it\r\ncosts the owner, it is ignorance and folly to talk about constitutional\r\namendments limiting trusts. So long as the great manufacturing centres\r\nof a monopolistic trust can get better rates than the centres of\r\nindependent effort, it is idle to talk about laws making it a crime to\r\nundersell for the purpose of driving a competitor from a market. You\r\nmust get into markets before you can compete. So long as railroads can\r\nbe persuaded to interfere with independent pipe-lines, to refuse oil\r\nfreight, to refuse loading facilities, lest they disturb their relations\r\nwith the Standard Oil Company, it is idle to talk about investigations\r\nor anti-trust legislation or application of the Sherman law. So long as\r\nthe Standard Oil Company can control transportation as it does to-day,\r\nit will remain master of the oil industry, and the people of the United\r\nStates will pay for their indifference and folly in regard to\r\ntransportation a good sound tax on oil, and they will yearly see an\r\nincreasing concentration of natural resources and transportation systems\r\nin the Standard Oil crowd.\r\n\r\nIf all the country had suffered from these raids on competition, had\r\nbeen the limiting of the business opportunity of a few hundred men and a\r\nconstant higher price for refined oil, the case would be serious enough,\r\nbut there is a more serious side to it. The ethical cost of all this is\r\nthe deep concern. We are a commercial people. We cannot boast of our\r\narts, our crafts, our cultivation; our boast is in the wealth we\r\nproduce. As a consequence business success is sanctified, and,\r\npractically, any methods which achieve it are justified by a larger and\r\nlarger class. All sorts of subterfuges and sophistries and slurring over\r\nof facts are employed to explain aggregations of capital whose\r\ndetermining factor has been like that of the Standard Oil Company,\r\nspecial privileges obtained by persistent secret effort in opposition to\r\nthe spirit of the law, the efforts of legislators, and the most\r\noutspoken public opinion. How often does one hear it argued, the\r\nStandard Oil Company is simply an inevitable result of economic\r\nconditions; that is, given the practices of the oil-bearing railroads in\r\n1872 and the elements of speculation and the over-refining in the oil\r\nbusiness, there was nothing for Mr. Rockefeller to do but secure special\r\nprivileges if he wished to save his business.\r\n\r\nNow in 1872 Mr. Rockefeller owned a successful refinery in Cleveland. He\r\nhad the advantage of water transportation a part of the year, access to\r\ntwo great trunk lines the year around. Under such able management as he\r\ncould give it his concern was bound to go on, given the demand for\r\nrefined oil. It was bound to draw other firms to it. When he went into\r\nthe South Improvement Company it was not to save his own business, but\r\nto destroy others. When he worked so persistently to secure rebates\r\nafter the breaking up of the South Improvement Company, it was in the\r\nface of an industry united against them. It was not to save his business\r\nthat he compelled the Empire Transportation Company to go out of the oil\r\nbusiness in 1877. Nothing but grave mismanagement could have destroyed\r\nhis business at that moment; it was to get every refinery in the country\r\nbut his own out of the way. It was not the necessity to save his\r\nbusiness which compelled Mr. Rockefeller to make war on the Tidewater.\r\nHe and the Tidewater could both have lived. It was to prevent prices of\r\ntransportation and of refined oil going down under competition. What\r\nnecessity was there for Mr. Rockefeller trying to prevent the United\r\nStates Pipe Line doing business?—only the greed of power and money.\r\nEvery great campaign against rival interests which the Standard Oil\r\nCompany has carried on has been inaugurated, not to save its life, but\r\nto build up and sustain a monopoly in the oil industry. These are not\r\nmere affirmations of a hostile critic; they are facts proved by\r\ndocuments and figures.\r\n\r\nCertain defenders go further and say that if some such combination had\r\nnot been formed the oil industry would have failed for lack of brains\r\nand capital. Such a statement is puerile. Here was an industry for whose\r\noutput the whole world was crying. Petroleum came at the moment when the\r\nvalue and necessity of a new, cheap light was recognised everywhere.\r\nBefore Mr. Rockefeller had ventured outside of Cleveland kerosene was\r\ngoing in quantities to every civilised country. Nothing could stop it,\r\nnothing check it, but the discovery of some cheaper light or the putting\r\nup of its price. The real “good of the oil business” in 1872 lay in\r\nmaking oil cheaper. It would flow all over the world on its own merit if\r\ncheap enough.\r\n\r\nThe claim that only by some such aggregation as Mr. Rockefeller formed\r\ncould enough capital have been obtained to develop the business falls\r\nutterly in face of fact. Look at the enormous amounts of capital, a\r\nlarge amount of it speculative, to be sure, which the oil men claim went\r\ninto their business in the first ten years. It was estimated that\r\nPhiladelphia alone put over $168,000,000 into the development of the Oil\r\nRegions, and New York $134,000,000, in their first decade of the\r\nbusiness. How this estimate was reached the authority for it does not\r\nsay.[175] It may have been the total capitalisation of the various oil\r\ncompanies launched in the two cities in that period. It shows very well,\r\nhowever, in what sort of figures the oil men were dealing. When the\r\nSouth Improvement Company trouble came in 1872, the producers launched a\r\nstatement in regard to the condition of their business in which they\r\nclaimed that they were using a capital of $200,000,000. Figures based on\r\nthe number of oil wells in operation or drilling at that time of course\r\nrepresent only a portion of the capital in use. Wild-catting and\r\nspeculation have always demanded a large amount of the money that the\r\noil men handled. The almost conservative figures in regard to the\r\ncapital invested in the Oil Regions in the early years were those of H.\r\nE. Wrigley, of the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania. Mr. Wrigley\r\nestimates that in the first twelve years of the business $235,000,000\r\nwas received from wells. This includes the cost of the land, of putting\r\ndown and operating the well, also the profit on the product. This\r\nestimate, however, makes no allowance for the sums used in\r\nspeculation—an estimate, indeed, which it was impossible for one to make\r\nwith any accuracy. The figures, unsatisfactory as they are, are ample\r\nproof, however, that there was plenty of money in the early days to\r\ncarry on the oil business. Indeed, there has always been plenty of money\r\nfor oil investment. It did not require Mr. Rockefeller’s capital to\r\ndevelop the Bradford oil fields, build the first seaboard pipe-line,\r\nopen West Virginia, Texas, or Kansas. The oil business would no more\r\nhave suffered for lack of capital without the Standard combination than\r\nthe iron or wheat or railroad or cotton business. The claim is idle,\r\ngiven the wealth and energy of the country in the forty-five years since\r\nthe discovery of oil.\r\n\r\nEqually well does both the history and the present condition of the oil\r\nbusiness show that it has not needed any such aggregation to give us\r\ncheap oil. The margin between crude and refined was made low by\r\ncompetition. It has rarely been as low as it would have been had there\r\nbeen free competition. For five years even the small independent\r\nrefineries outside of the Pure Oil Company have been able to make a\r\nprofit on the prices set by the Standard, and this in spite of the\r\nhigher transportation they have paid on both crude and refined, and the\r\nwall of seclusion the railroads build around domestic markets.\r\n\r\nVery often people who admit the facts, who are willing to see that Mr.\r\nRockefeller has employed force and fraud to secure his ends, justify him\r\nby declaring, “It’s business.” That is, “it’s business” has to come to\r\nbe a legitimate excuse for hard dealing, sly tricks, special privileges.\r\nIt is a common enough thing to hear men arguing that the ordinary laws\r\nof morality do not apply in business. Now, if the Standard Oil Company\r\nwere the only concern in the country guilty of the practices which have\r\ngiven it monopolistic power, this story never would have been written.\r\nWere it alone in these methods, public scorn would long ago have made\r\nshort work of the Standard Oil Company. But it is simply the most\r\nconspicuous type of what can be done by these practices. The methods it\r\nemploys with such acumen, persistency, and secrecy are employed by all\r\nsorts of business men, from corner grocers up to bankers. If exposed,\r\nthey are excused on the ground that this is business. If the point is\r\npushed, frequently the defender of the practice falls back on the\r\nChristian doctrine of charity, and points that we are erring mortals and\r\nmust allow for each other’s weaknesses!—an excuse which, if carried to\r\nits legitimate conclusion, would leave our business men weeping on one\r\nanother’s shoulders over human frailty, while they picked one another’s\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nOne of the most depressing features of the ethical side of the matter is\r\nthat instead of such methods arousing contempt they are more or less\r\nopenly admired. And this is logical. Canonise “business success,” and\r\nmen who make a success like that of the Standard Oil Trust become\r\nnational heroes! The history of its organisation is studied as a\r\npractical lesson in money-making. It is the most startling feature of\r\nthe case to one who would like to feel that it is possible to be a\r\ncommercial people and yet a race of gentlemen. Of course such practices\r\nexclude men by all the codes from the rank of gentlemen, just as such\r\npractices would exclude men from the sporting world or athletic field.\r\nThere is no gaming table in the world where loaded dice are tolerated,\r\nno athletic field where men must not start fair. Yet Mr. Rockefeller has\r\nsystematically played with loaded dice, and it is doubtful if there has\r\never been a time since 1872 when he has run a race with a competitor and\r\nstarted fair. Business played in this way loses all its sportsmanlike\r\nqualities. It is fit only for tricksters.\r\n\r\nThe effects on the very men who fight these methods on the ground that\r\nthey are ethically wrong are deplorable. Brought into competition with\r\nthe trust, badgered, foiled, spied upon, they come to feel as if\r\nanything is fair when the Standard is the opponent. The bitterness\r\nagainst the Standard Oil Company in many parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio\r\nis such that a verdict from a jury on the merits of the evidence is\r\nalmost impossible! A case in point occurred a few years ago in the\r\nBradford field. An oil producer was discovered stealing oil from the\r\nNational Transit Company. He had tapped the main line and for at least\r\ntwo years had run a small but steady stream of Standard oil into his\r\nprivate tank. Finally the thieving pipe was discovered, and the owner of\r\nit, after acknowledging his guilt, was brought to trial. The jury gave a\r\nverdict of Not guilty! They seemed to feel that though the guilt was\r\nacknowledged, there probably was a Standard trick concealed somewhere.\r\nAnyway it was the Standard Oil Company and it deserved to be stolen\r\nfrom! The writer has frequently heard men, whose own business was\r\nconducted with scrupulous fairness, say in cases of similar stealing\r\nthat they would never condemn a man who stole from the Standard! Of\r\ncourse such a state of feeling undermines the whole moral nature of a\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe blackmailing cases of which the Standard Oil Company complain are a\r\nnatural result of its own practices. Men going into an independent\r\nrefining business have for years been accustomed to say: “Well, if they\r\nwon’t let us alone, we’ll make them pay a good price.” The Standard\r\ncomplains that such men build simply to sell out. There may be cases of\r\nthis. Probably there are, though the writer has no absolute proof of any\r\nsuch. Certainly there is no satisfactory proof that the refinery in the\r\nfamous Buffalo case was built to sell, though that it was offered for\r\nsale when the opposition of the Everests, the managers of the Standard\r\nconcern, had become so serious as later to be stamped as criminal by\r\njudge and jury, there is no doubt. Certainly nothing was shown to have\r\nbeen done or said by Mr. Matthews, the owner of the concern which the\r\nStandard was fighting, which might not have been expected from a man who\r\nhad met the kind of opposition he had from the time he went into\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, blackmail and every other business vice is the natural\r\nresult of the peculiar business practices of the Standard. If business\r\nis to be treated as warfare and not as a peaceful pursuit, as they have\r\npersisted in treating it, they cannot expect the men they are fighting\r\nto lie down and die without a struggle. If they get special privileges\r\nthey must expect their competitors to struggle to get them. If they will\r\nfind it more profitable to buy out a refinery than to let it live, they\r\nmust expect the owner to get an extortionate price if he can. And when\r\nthey complain of these practices and call them blackmail, they show thin\r\nsporting blood. They must not expect to monopolise hard dealings, if\r\nthey do oil.\r\n\r\nThese are considerations of the ethical effect of such business\r\npractices on those outside and in competition. As for those within the\r\norganisation there is one obvious effect worth noting. The Standard men\r\nas a body have nothing to do with public affairs, except as it is\r\nnecessary to manipulate them for the “good of the oil business.” The\r\nnotion that the business man must not appear in politics and religion\r\nsave as a “stand-patter”—not even as a thinking, aggressive force—is\r\ndemoralising, intellectually and morally. Ever since 1872 the\r\norganisation has appeared in politics only to oppose legislation\r\nobviously for the public good. At that time the oil industry was young,\r\nonly twelve years old, and it was suffering from too rapid growth, from\r\nspeculation, from rapacity of railroads, but it was struggling manfully\r\nwith all these questions. The question of railroad discriminations and\r\nextortions was one of the “live questions” of the country. The oil men\r\nas a mass were allied against it. The theory that the railroad was a\r\npublic servant bound by the spirit of its charter to treat all shippers\r\nalike, that fair play demanded open equal rates to all, was generally\r\nheld in the oil country at the time Mr. Rockefeller and his friends\r\nsprung the South Improvement Company. One has only to read the oil\r\njournals at the time of the Oil War of 1872 to see how seriously all\r\nphases of the transportation question were considered. The country was a\r\nunit against the rebate system. Agreements were signed with the\r\nrailroads that all rates henceforth should be equal. The signatures were\r\nnot on before Mr. Rockefeller had a rebate, and gradually others got\r\nthem until the Standard had won the advantages it expected the South\r\nImprovement Company to give it. From that time to this Mr. Rockefeller\r\nhas had to fight the best sentiment of the oil country and of the\r\ncountry at large as to what is for the public good. He and his\r\ncolleagues kept a strong alliance in Washington fighting the Interstate\r\nCommerce Bill from the time the first one was introduced in 1876 until\r\nthe final passage in 1887. Every measure looking to the freedom and\r\nequalisation of transportation has met his opposition, as have bills for\r\ngiving greater publicity to the operations of corporations. In many of\r\nthe great state Legislatures one of the first persons to be pointed out\r\nto a visitor is the Standard Oil lobbyist. Now, no one can dispute the\r\nright of the Standard Oil Company to express its opinions on proposed\r\nlegislation. It has the same right to do this as all the rest of the\r\nworld. It is only the character of its opposition which is open to\r\ncriticism, the fact that it is always fighting measures which equalise\r\nprivileges and which make it more necessary for men to start fair and\r\nplay fair in doing business.\r\n\r\nOf course the effect of directly practising many of their methods is\r\nobvious. For example, take the whole system of keeping track of\r\nindependent business. There are practices required which corrupt every\r\nman who has a hand in them. One of the most deplorable things about it\r\nis that most of the work is done by youngsters. The freight clerk who\r\nreports the independent oil shipments for a fee of five or ten dollars a\r\nmonth is probably a young man, learning his first lessons in corporate\r\nmorality. If he happens to sit in Mr. Rockefeller’s church on Sundays,\r\nthrough what sort of a haze will he receive the teachings? There is\r\nsomething alarming to those who believe that commerce should be a\r\npeaceful pursuit, and who believe that the moral law holds good\r\nthroughout the entire range of human relations, in knowing that so large\r\na body of young men in this country are consciously or unconsciously\r\ngrowing up with the idea that business is war and that morals have\r\nnothing to do with its practice.\r\n\r\nAnd what are we going to do about it? for it is _our_ business. We, the\r\npeople of the United States, and nobody else, must cure whatever is\r\nwrong in the industrial situation, typified by this narrative of the\r\ngrowth of the Standard Oil Company. That our first task is to secure\r\nfree and equal transportation privileges by rail, pipe and waterway is\r\nevident. It is not an easy matter. It is one which may require\r\noperations which will seem severe; but the whole system of\r\ndiscrimination has been nothing but violence, and those who have\r\nprofited by it cannot complain if the curing of the evils they have\r\nwrought bring hardship in turn on them. At all events, until the\r\ntransportation matter is settled, and settled right, the monopolistic\r\ntrust will be with us, a leech on our pockets, a barrier to our free\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nAs for the ethical side, there is no cure but in an increasing scorn of\r\nunfair play—an increasing sense that a thing won by breaking the rules\r\nof the game is not worth the winning. When the business man who fights\r\nto secure special privileges, to crowd his competitor off the track by\r\nother than fair competitive methods, receives the same summary\r\ndisdainful ostracism by his fellows that the doctor or lawyer who is\r\n“unprofessional,” the athlete who abuses the rules, receives, we shall\r\nhave gone a long way toward making commerce a fit pursuit for our young\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 37 (See page 2004)\r\n          ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OF THE TIDEWATER PIPE LINE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Incorporation Tidewater Pipe Company, Limited, of Titusville,\r\n  Pennsylvania.

FLAGLER IN REGARD TO THE TIDEWATER CONTEST\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3,112, page 783.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now you can make your statement.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I want to say this: The Tidewater Pipe Line was the first line\r\n  built to the seaboard, and it had a connection with the Reading\r\n  Railroad, by which the railroad and the line jointly undertook to do\r\n  business. We had several discussions of pipe-lines of the future\r\n  with the representatives of the Tidewater Pipe Line, and would have\r\n  had no difficulty whatever in making satisfactory arrangements with\r\n  them, which would have removed all unnecessary competition, but the\r\n  New York Central, the Erie road, and the Pennsylvania Central said\r\n  to us: “Gentlemen, we don’t want you to make any alliance of any\r\n  formal nature with the Tidewater Pipe Line.” They added: “We will\r\n  protect you in the matter of rates as against any competition\r\n  furnished by the Reading and Tidewater Pipe Line.” I replied to\r\n  that: “I have never seen a contest begun of this kind but what there\r\n  was an end to it. Now, we can make a satisfactory arrangement with\r\n  the Tidewater Pipe Line and avoid all this contest. It is not\r\n  necessary for you to throw away any money. We are not seekers after\r\n  low rates. We have done our business by you, and are willing to\r\n  continue, but only upon one single, solitary condition: we would\r\n  prefer not to have this contest; it is better that the Tidewater and\r\n  Reading Railroad should be recognised.” The reply was: “We never\r\n  will recognise them as carriers of oil.”\r\n\r\n  _Q._ That was the reply of these three trunk lines?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir. I said: “Gentlemen, the other thing is of a great\r\n  deal more importance than the rates. The rates are short-lived\r\n  affairs.” Now, I will make this explanation in justice to ourselves,\r\n  in reply to the remark you made of our contest with the Tidewater\r\n  Line. We had no contest. It was simply a contest of the\r\n  transportation lines, and we, like fools, allowed ourselves, instead\r\n  of making arrangements with the Tidewater Line, to say to the trunk\r\n  lines: “Very well, then, we will stick to you and leave you to fight\r\n  out this battle.” They fought it for a year or two, and you know how\r\n  it ended.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Three or four years, was it not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I thought it was two years.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then I understand you to say that all that struggle, and the\r\n  low rate that the trunk line charged at the time the competition\r\n  with the Tidewater and Reading came into existence, was brought\r\n  about by the trunk lines themselves?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was a struggle on the part of the trunk lines to hold the\r\n  entire oil business, and they avowed it to me not once, but many\r\n  times, that it was their firm intention never to recognise the\r\n  Tidewater to the seaboard.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And during that struggle they actually carried it at fifteen\r\n  cents a barrel?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I should have said twenty or twenty-five cents. I knew it was a\r\n  ridiculously low rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 39A (See page 2024)\r\n          AGREEMENT BETWEEN STANDARD AND TIDEWATER REFINERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n  [From manuscript presented to the Industrial Commission by Lewis\r\n  Emery, Jr.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  This agreement, made and entered into the ninth day of October, A.D.\r\n  1883, by and between the Standard Oil Company, a corporation of\r\n  Ohio, the Standard Oil Company of New York, a corporation of New\r\n  York, and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, a corporation of\r\n  New Jersey, who collectively constitute the party of the first part,\r\n  and the Ocean Oil Company, a corporation of New Jersey, the Chester\r\n  Oil Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, and Ayres, Lombard and\r\n  Company, a corporation of New York, who collectively constitute the\r\n  party of the second part.\r\n\r\n  _Witnesseth_: That in consideration of the mutual covenants and\r\n  agreements hereby made and entered into, the said parties do hereby\r\n  covenant and agree to and with each other as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First._—That for the purpose of this contract the business of\r\n  refining petroleum is defined to mean the distillation of crude\r\n  petroleum within the United States, without regard to where the\r\n  crude is obtained;

All\r\n  refineries now owned or controlled by those owning or controlling a\r\n  majority of the refineries embraced in Schedule “B,” and all\r\n  refineries which may hereafter be acquired or controlled in the same\r\n  interest shall, as acquired or controlled, be added to said Schedule\r\n  “B,” and by such addition be included in the terms of the agreement.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—It is understood that forty-two gallons constitute a\r\n  barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—A year, whenever used in this contract, is understood to\r\n  mean a calendar year.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—This agreement shall take effect on the first day of\r\n  October, 1883, and remain in force for fifteen (15) years from said\r\n  date.\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, however, and it is agreed that it shall not remain in\r\n  force longer than a certain other agreement of even date herewith\r\n  between the National Transit Company and the United Pipe Lines of\r\n  the first part, and the Tidewater Pipe Company, Limited, of the\r\n  second part, shall remain in force, and that a termination of said\r\n  other agreements shall at the same time terminate this one.\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the said parties have caused their common and\r\n  corporate seals to be hereto attached and to be attested by the\r\n  signature of their proper officers the day and year first aforesaid.\r\n\r\n Standard Oil Company, by\r\n                                        O.

All deliveries from local lines of pipe of crude\r\n  petroleum gathered as aforesaid, to or for any of the refineries\r\n  then embraced in Schedule “A” or Schedule “B” (which schedules are\r\n  hereto attached and made part of this agreement), and also all\r\n  deliveries of crude petroleum from any of the trunk lines of pipe\r\n  now owned or controlled, or which may hereafter be owned or\r\n  controlled, by any party hereto, either directly or indirectly, and\r\n  the getting of such crude petroleum to the point of delivery shall\r\n  constitute transporting, and the business of so getting and\r\n  delivering crude petroleum is the business of said transporting\r\n  department, except, and it is agreed, that whatever petroleum\r\n  gathered as aforesaid shall be delivered to or for any party hereto,\r\n  or to or for any refinery or refining company then embraced in\r\n  either of said schedules, for export in its crude state, whether the\r\n  same shall be delivered from a local line of pipe or a trunk line of\r\n  pipe, shall not be included in transporting, nor in the business of\r\n  said transporting department.\r\n\r\n  All petroleum gathered as aforesaid and delivered from local lines\r\n  of pipe for export in its crude state (other than deliveries to\r\n  trunk lines of pipe of such petroleum for export in its crude state)\r\n  by or for any party hereto or by or for any refinery or refining\r\n  company then embraced in either of said schedules, shall constitute\r\n  interior exporting and the business of receiving and exporting such\r\n  petroleum in its crude state shall be the business of said interior\r\n  export department.\r\n\r\n  All petroleum gathered as aforesaid and delivered from trunk lines\r\n  of pipe for export in its crude state by or for any party hereto or\r\n  by or for any refinery or refining company then embraced in either\r\n  of said schedules shall constitute seaboard exporting, and the\r\n  business of receiving and exporting such petroleum in its crude\r\n  state shall be the business of said seaboard export department.\r\n\r\n  All pipes used for gathering and delivering at points in the\r\n  oil-producing regions are herein called local lines.\r\n\r\n  All lines of pipe used for transporting beyond the oil-producing\r\n  regions are herein called trunk lines.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—That in each said department of the business the\r\n  respective parties hereto shall be entitled to do the following\r\n  percentage or proportionate part of the aggregate business done by\r\n  all parties hereto then in said department, viz.: The said parties\r\n  of the first part eighty-eight and one-half (88½) per centum\r\n  thereof, and the said party of the second part eleven and one-half\r\n  (11½) per centum thereof.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—Each party hereto shall do as nearly as practicable its\r\n  said proportion or percentage of said business. And it is agreed\r\n  that:\r\n\r\n  _A._—If in any calendar month either party shall gather more than\r\n  its said percentage of said aggregate of crude petroleum gathered,\r\n  as gathering is herein defined, it shall pay to the other party on\r\n  the quantity gathered in excess of its said percentage an amount per\r\n  barrel equal to three-fourths of the then current full rate per\r\n  barrel charged for collecting and delivering crude petroleum in the\r\n  oil-producing regions—commonly called local pipage;\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, however, and it is hereby agreed that this clause shall\r\n  not be applicable to crude petroleum gathered as aforesaid prior to\r\n  September 1, 1884.\r\n\r\n  _And provided, further_, That the excess over its said percentage\r\n  gathered prior to September 1, 1884, by either party shall on demand\r\n  of the other be delivered to the other party at some point or points\r\n  in the oil-producing regions convenient to both the party receiving\r\n  and the party delivering (the means and places to be mutually agreed\r\n  upon) when and as often as the said excess amounts to ten thousand\r\n  (10,000) barrels, upon legal orders or certificates with storage and\r\n  assessments thereon paid to date of delivery being presented\r\n  therefor, or upon the payment of the then market price of United\r\n  Pipe Line certificates for a like quantity. The party receiving\r\n  shall pay the party delivering the same a gathering charge of ten\r\n  (10) cents per barrel upon all petroleum so delivered.\r\n\r\n  _B._—If in any calendar month either the parties of the first part\r\n  or the party of the second part shall transport and deliver more\r\n  than their or its said percentage of the said aggregate of crude\r\n  petroleum transported, as transporting is herein defined, they or it\r\n  shall pay to the other party twenty-five (25) cents per barrel upon\r\n  the quantity transported and delivered in excess of their or its\r\n  said percentage.\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That the amount payable under this clause shall not\r\n  exceed the amount it would cost to bring said excess from the mouth\r\n  of a local pipe in the oil-producing regions to either the port of\r\n  New York or the port of Philadelphia at the then current rate of\r\n  transportation by any route or method not owned or controlled\r\n  directly or indirectly by any party hereto.\r\n\r\n  _C._—If in any calendar month either party shall do more than its\r\n  said percentage of business in either the exterior export department\r\n  or the seaboard export department, it shall pay to the other party\r\n  twenty-five (25) cents per barrel upon the quantity so exported in\r\n  excess of its said percentage.\r\n\r\n  _Provided, however_, That the amount per barrel payable under this\r\n  clause shall not exceed the amount per barrel which would be payable\r\n  under Clause B and its proviso at the same time for excess in the\r\n  transporting department.\r\n\r\n  _D._—If in any year either party shall neglect or refuse to do\r\n  eighty (80) per centum of its said proportion or percentage in any\r\n  department of said business, then the party so doing less than\r\n  eighty (80) per centum of its said proportion shall return or repay\r\n  to the other party the sums received in that department under the\r\n  provisions of this paragraph in excess of the sums paid in the same\r\n  department under the same provisions during the same year.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—Each party shall make to the other daily reports showing:\r\n\r\n  1st. All crude petroleum gathered, as gathering is herein defined.\r\n\r\n  2nd. All crude petroleum delivered from local lines other than\r\n  deliveries to trunk lines, stating when, where and to whom\r\n  delivered.\r\n\r\n  3rd. All crude petroleum delivered from local lines to trunk lines,\r\n  stating when, where and to which line delivered.\r\n\r\n  4th. All crude petroleum delivered from trunk lines, stating when,\r\n  where and to whom delivered.\r\n\r\n  5th. All crude petroleum exported in the crude state, stating when,\r\n  where and from whom received, so as to distinguish between receipts\r\n  from local lines and receipts from trunk lines, and when, where and\r\n  to whom delivered for export. The correctness of such reports shall,\r\n  if required by either party, be verified by the party making them.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—On all deliveries of crude petroleum from local lines made\r\n  by said parties of the first part or either of them, other than such\r\n  deliveries as constitute transporting, as transporting is\r\n  hereinbefore defined, the parties of the first part will account for\r\n  and pay to the party of the second part eleven and one-half (11½)\r\n  per centum of the then current full rate of local pipage, first\r\n  deducting from such full rate ten (10) cents per barrel for the work\r\n  of gathering and delivering such petroleum.\r\n\r\n  On all deliveries of crude petroleum from local lines made by said\r\n  party of the second part other than such deliveries as constitute\r\n  transporting as hereinbefore defined, the party of the second part\r\n  will account for and pay to the parties of the first part\r\n  eighty-eight and one-half (88½) per centum of the then current full\r\n  rate of local pipage, first deducting from such full rate ten (10)\r\n  cents per barrel for the work of gathering and delivering such\r\n  petroleum.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—It is agreed that in case of excess of deliveries over the\r\n  quantity gathered, as gathering is herein before defined, by all the\r\n  parties hereto, the stocks in custody of the respective parties\r\n  shall to the extent of such excess be diminished in the ratio of\r\n  eighty-eight and one-half (88½) per centum thereof from the stocks\r\n  in custody of said parties of the first part, and eleven and\r\n  one-half (11½) per centum thereof from the stocks in custody of said\r\n  party of the second part; and to this end it is agreed that whenever\r\n  and as often as under the working of this agreement the depletion of\r\n  the stocks in the custody of either of the respective parties shall\r\n  amount to ten thousand (10,000) barrels in excess of such party’s\r\n  percentage of depletion, then the other party shall and will on\r\n  demand deliver, and the party whose stocks are so depleted will when\r\n  tendered receive, said ten thousand (10,000) barrels at some point\r\n  or points in the oil-producing regions convenient to both the party\r\n  receiving and the party delivering (the means and place to be\r\n  mutually agreed upon), upon legal orders or certificates with\r\n  storage and assessments thereon paid to date of delivery being\r\n  presented therefor, or upon the payment of the then market price of\r\n  United Pipe Line certificates for a like quantity. The party\r\n  receiving shall pay to the party delivering a gathering charge of\r\n  ten (10) cents per barrel upon all petroleum gathered.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—A settlement shall be made on or before the fifteenth day\r\n  of each month of all business done under this agreement during the\r\n  preceding month, and payment shall then be made of all such sums as\r\n  under the terms hereof shall be found payable by either party to the\r\n  other.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—If in any year the profits of the party of the second part\r\n  added to the profits of the several refineries then embraced in\r\n  Schedule “B” shall in the aggregate amount to less than five hundred\r\n  thousand (500,000) dollars (excluding from the calculations all\r\n  profits realised and losses sustained from speculation and the value\r\n  of property destroyed by fire), then the said party of the second\r\n  part shall have the right within three months from the time the\r\n  profits of such year shall have been ascertained to cancel this\r\n  agreement.\r\n\r\n  _Provided, however_, That the said right shall not exist or shall\r\n  not be exercised under the following circumstances, to wit:\r\n\r\n  1st. If the average of such profits during the said year and all\r\n  previous years from the beginning of this agreement shall equal five\r\n  hundred thousand (500,000) dollars per year.\r\n\r\n  2nd. If the said parties of the first part or either of them shall\r\n  contribute to the said party of the second part such sums of money\r\n  as together with the said profits for the said year will make the\r\n  average profit five hundred thousand (500,000) dollars per year.\r\n\r\n  _And provided, further_, That in exercising the right of\r\n  cancellation the said party of the second part must give to one or\r\n  both of said parties of the first part three (3) months’ written\r\n  notice of said cancellation, which notice must be accompanied by a\r\n  statement of the said profits of the party of the second part, and\r\n  of said refineries then embraced in Schedule “B,” and any\r\n  contributions made as aforesaid must be made within the said three\r\n  (3) months.\r\n\r\n  The party receiving said notice shall have the right to verify the\r\n  statement by an examination of the books of said party of the second\r\n  part, and books of said refineries.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._—All refineries now owned or controlled by those owning or\r\n  controlling a majority of the refineries embraced in Schedule “A”\r\n  are or shall be included in Schedule “A”; and all refineries which\r\n  may hereafter be acquired or controlled in the same interest shall,\r\n  as acquired or controlled, be added to said Schedule “A,” and by\r\n  such addition be included in the terms of this agreement.\r\n\r\n  All refineries now owned or controlled by those owning or\r\n  controlling a majority of the refineries embraced in Schedule “B”\r\n  are or shall be included in Schedule “B”; and all refineries which\r\n  may hereafter be acquired or controlled in the same interest shall,\r\n  as acquired or controlled, be added to said Schedule “B,” and by\r\n  such addition be included in the terms of this agreement.\r\n\r\n  _Tenth._—It is agreed that any business done in either the interior\r\n  export department or the seaboard export department by any of the\r\n  refineries or refining companies then embraced in Schedule “A” shall\r\n  be treated for the purpose of this agreement as if done by the\r\n  parties of the first part; and that any business done in either of\r\n  said export departments by any of the refineries or refining\r\n  companies then embraced in Schedule “B” shall be treated for the\r\n  purposes of this agreement as if done by the party of the second\r\n  part.\r\n\r\n  _Eleventh._—It is understood that forty-two (42) gallons constitute\r\n  a barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Twelfth._—A year, whenever used in this contract, is understood to\r\n  mean a calendar year.\r\n\r\n  _Thirteenth._—This agreement shall take effect as of the first day\r\n  of October, 1883, and unless sooner cancelled, as provided in the\r\n  eighth paragraph, shall remain in force for fifteen (15) years from\r\n  said first day of October, 1883.\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the said parties of the first part have caused\r\n  their common and corporate seals to be hereto attached and to be\r\n  attested by the signatures of their proper officers; and the said\r\n  party of the second part has caused the same to be signed in its\r\n  name and on its behalf by two of its managers, the day and year\r\n  first aforesaid.\r\n\r\n                                             NATIONAL TRANSIT COMPANY,\r\n       [Nat.

Volume I, pages\r\n  663–666.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Memorandum of a traffic agreement, made this twenty-second day of\r\n  August, 1884, between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, hereinafter\r\n  designated the railroad company, and the National Transit Company,\r\n  hereinafter designated the transit company, _Witnesseth_:\r\n\r\n  That for consideration mutually interchanged, the parties hereto\r\n  agree, each with the other, as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First._—The transit company owns an extended system of local pipes\r\n  in the Oil Regions of Pennsylvania and New York, which are grouped\r\n  into a separate division, known as the United Pipe Lines Division of\r\n  the National Transit Company. This division will be hereinafter\r\n  designated as the Transit Company’s Local Division.\r\n\r\n  The business of this division is to collect oil from producer, store\r\n  it in tanks, and deliver it, as may be desired, to any through\r\n  carrier of petroleum, which will transport the same to where it is\r\n  to be refined or otherwise disposed of.\r\n\r\n  The transit company also own certain through or trunk line pipes,\r\n  extending from several points of connection with the aforesaid local\r\n  pipe division to various refining and terminal points.\r\n\r\n  With these latter pipes, which will be hereinafter entitled the\r\n  Transit Company’s Trunk Line Division, it competes in the through\r\n  carriage of petroleum with all other through carriers, whether pipe\r\n  or rail.\r\n\r\n  The business of its local division is therefore entirely distinct\r\n  from the business of its through trunk line division.\r\n\r\n  It undertakes and agrees that its local division will deliver into\r\n  cars furnished by the railroad company at any of its regular\r\n  delivery points and under its regular delivery rules whatever\r\n  petroleum the owners thereof may desire to have so delivered, and as\r\n  the railroad may furnish cars to transport, and will make no\r\n  discrimination in its local charges for carriage, storage, and other\r\n  services, or in the use of any of its local facilities, against such\r\n  oil, but will at all times treat it in the said respects as\r\n  favourably as it at the same time treats any other petroleum which\r\n  may be delivered to its own trunk line division or to any other\r\n  through carriers.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The transit company agrees that all petroleum brought to\r\n  the Atlantic seaboard by all existing carriers, whether rail or\r\n  pipe, now engaged in transporting such property, or which may\r\n  hereafter engage in such transportation in conjunction with the\r\n  transit company’s pipe-lines, shall be ascertained monthly, and so\r\n  much of it as shall have been shipped in the refined state shall be\r\n  reduced to its equivalent in crude oil by considering that one and\r\n  three-tenths (1–3/10) gallons of crude are required to make one (1)\r\n  gallon of refined oil. It further undertakes and agrees that if of\r\n  the total so transported the railroad company shall not have moved\r\n  in its cars twenty-six (26) per centum thereof, the transit company\r\n  shall cause to be delivered to cars furnished by the railroad\r\n  company at Milton, Pa., such quantity of crude petroleum as shall,\r\n  when added to the amount which has been actually transported by the\r\n  railroad company to the seaboard in said month, make the total\r\n  transported by the railroad company in said month equal to said\r\n  twenty-six (26) per centum.\r\n\r\n  The railroad company agrees to furnish the needful cars and\r\n  facilities, and promptly transport the oil which the transit company\r\n  agrees in this contract to deliver to it at Milton:\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That if during any month the railroad company is not\r\n  able to assign from its oil equipments a sufficient number of cars\r\n  to the traffic of the transit company to move the proportion of oil\r\n  herein provided to be delivered at Milton, then during that month\r\n  the transit company shall only be required to so deliver to the\r\n  railroad company such quantity of oil as the railroad company shall\r\n  be able to transport, and shall not be required to make up any\r\n  deficiency that may occur during said month.\r\n\r\n  Efforts shall be made by the transit company to deliver so much\r\n  during each month as will probably be necessary to make the total\r\n  carried by the railroad company equal to said percentage.\r\n\r\n  Shortages, if not due to short supply of cars, and such excesses as\r\n  may be found to have occurred in any month, shall be adjusted in the\r\n  following month, or as soon afterwards as shall be possible.\r\n\r\n  _Third._—It is agreed that the proportion of petroleum which the\r\n  transit company is to deliver under the second section of this\r\n  agreement shall be considered as petroleum transported from\r\n  Coalgrove, Pa., via Milton, Pa., to the Atlantic seaboard, and that\r\n  the railroad company shall be entitled to one-half of the current\r\n  through rates thereon.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that whenever the through rates shall be so low that\r\n  the railroad company shall suspend the movement of oil by its cars,\r\n  at other points than Milton, the transit company shall during such\r\n  suspension not be bound to deliver to the railroad company any oil\r\n  at Milton.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._—All joint rates for the joint transportation of oil from\r\n  any delivery point of the local pipe division aforesaid to any\r\n  refining or terminal point shall be fixed by the railroad company,\r\n  subject to the advice and concurrence of the transit company.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that said joint through rates shall be uniform to all\r\n  parties. The railroad company stipulates that it will make no\r\n  discrimination whatever, either in rates or facilities, against the\r\n  transit company or against the oil which the said transit company\r\n  herein covenants to deliver to it.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that the joint through rates to Philadelphia shall\r\n  always be five cents less per barrel on crude oil, or its refined\r\n  equivalent, than shall be currently charged to New York harbour.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that the joint through rates, which shall be so fixed\r\n  from time to time, shall be as low as shall be currently made\r\n  between same and similar points by rival carriers of petroleum, and\r\n  shall not be higher than an approximate mileage proportion of rates\r\n  current on petroleum produced south of Oil City, nor than rates from\r\n  Olean and similar points.\r\n\r\n  It is also agreed that rates on refined oil and other products of\r\n  crude oil shall be fixed by the railroad company upon the following\r\n  basis, viz.:\r\n\r\n  From railroad stations in the Oil Regions to which oil is delivered\r\n  by local pipes the rate to any point east thereof on a barrel of\r\n  refined oil or other products shall be one and three-tenths (1–3/10)\r\n  times the current rate on a barrel of crude oil to the same point.\r\n\r\n  From Pittsburg the rate to any point east thereof on a barrel of\r\n  refined oil or other products shall be one and three-tenths (1–3/10)\r\n  the rate currently charged on crude oil to any such eastern point\r\n  from rail points south of Oil City:\r\n\r\n  _Provided_, That one and three-tenths times the charges for moving a\r\n  barrel of crude oil by rail or through pipe from the local pipe to\r\n  Pittsburg shall first be deducted therefrom.\r\n\r\n  From Cleveland and Buffalo the net rate on a barrel of refined oil\r\n  or other products to any point east thereof shall be not less than\r\n  is currently charged to the same point from Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._—Whenever the term barrel is used herein, unless otherwise\r\n  specified, it means forty-five gallons of crude petroleum; and\r\n  whenever the term oil is used herein, unless otherwise specified, it\r\n  means crude petroleum.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._—The transit company hereby agrees that it will not make any\r\n  more favourable terms with any other rail line connecting with any\r\n  of its pipes than the terms which under this agreement are given to\r\n  the railroad company; or if for any reason it should desire to do\r\n  so, it hereby agrees to modify this contract so as to give the said\r\n  “more favourable terms” to the railroad company.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._—All existing contracts between the parties hereto shall\r\n  be deemed to have been accomplished, and shall become void and of no\r\n  effect upon the day this contract goes into operation.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._—This contract shall take effect as of the first day of\r\n  August, 1884, and shall continue until terminated under the\r\n  provisions hereof. It may be terminated after August 1, 1889, by\r\n  either party hereto giving ninety days’ written notice to the other\r\n  of a desire that it shall end, at the expiration of which notice it\r\n  shall cease and determine.\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the parties hereto have executed this\r\n  agreement under their corporate seals the day and date above\r\n  written.\r\n\r\n                   THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY,\r\n           [L.S.]  By FRANK THOMSON, _Second Vice-President_.\r\n           Attest: JOHN C. SIMS, JR., _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n                   THE NATIONAL TRANSIT COMPANY,\r\n           [L.S.]  By C. A. GRISCOM, _President_.\r\n           Attest: JOHN BUSHNELL, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Memorandum of agreement, made this twenty-second day of August,\r\n  1884, between the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, hereinafter\r\n  designated the railroad company, and the National Transit Company,\r\n  hereinafter designated the transit company.\r\n\r\n  _Witnesseth_: That for considerations mutually interchanged the\r\n  parties hereto hereby agree with each other as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, The parties hereto have made an agreement of even date\r\n  herewith, in which, among other things, it is stipulated that under\r\n  certain circumstances the transit company shall deliver certain\r\n  crude petroleum into cars furnished by the railroad company at\r\n  Milton, Pa.; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, It has been proposed that the railroad company shall\r\n  contract with the transit company to the effect that the transit\r\n  company shall transport through its pipe-lines the aforesaid crude\r\n  oil, which, under the other contract aforesaid, it has undertaken to\r\n  deliver into the cars of the railroad company at Milton.\r\n\r\n  _Now, therefore_, this agreement witnesseth:\r\n\r\n  _First._—The railroad company agrees that instead of delivering said\r\n  crude oil to said cars at Milton, the transit company shall\r\n  transport the same through its pipes to destination, and the transit\r\n  company undertakes and agrees to do such transportation. It is\r\n  mutually agreed that the compensation to the transit company for\r\n  doing said work shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n  Whenever the through rate for transporting a barrel of crude\r\n  petroleum from Olean to Philadelphia shall be forty cents, the\r\n  transit company shall receive eight cents per barrel as such\r\n  compensation for so much of said oil as under the provisions hereof\r\n  shall be considered as Philadelphia oil.\r\n\r\n  For each five cents of increase or diminution in said rates from\r\n  Olean to Philadelphia the said compensation on Philadelphia oil\r\n  shall be increased or diminished one cent per barrel.\r\n\r\n  _Provided, however_, That the transit company shall not be obliged\r\n  to accept less than six cents per barrel, and shall not receive more\r\n  than ten cents per barrel on such Philadelphia oil.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that the said compensation on the oil, which under the\r\n  provisions hereof is to be deemed New York oil, shall be one cent\r\n  per barrel greater than it currently shall be on Philadelphia oil.\r\n\r\n  Whenever, and from time to time, as the said joint through rates\r\n  shall be so low that the said minimum compensation to the transit\r\n  company of six cents per barrel shall be as much or more than the\r\n  railroad company’s share of said joint through rates, this contract\r\n  may, at the option of either party hereto, be suspended during all\r\n  or any part of the time such low rates shall prevail. During such\r\n  suspension the aforesaid other contract shall alone remain in force;\r\n  but whenever, and from time to time, as said joint through rates\r\n  shall again be high enough to make the said minimum compensation,\r\n  under said sliding scale, less than the said share of said joint\r\n  through rates, this contract shall again resume its force and\r\n  effect.\r\n\r\n  _Second._—The transit company agrees to account for, and pay to the\r\n  railroad company, on or before the twentieth of each month, the\r\n  latter’s share of the joint rates on joint business _via_ Milton (as\r\n  provided in said other contract) during the next preceding month,\r\n  first retaining, however, the proportion of such share which it is\r\n  hereinbefore agreed the transit company is to have for its services\r\n  in pumping said oil to the seaboard.\r\n\r\n  It is agreed that all such joint business shall be considered as\r\n  having transported from Coalgrove _via_ Milton, Pa., to the Atlantic\r\n  seaboard, and that it shall be considered as having gone either to\r\n  Baltimore, Philadelphia, or New York, or partly to each. The\r\n  proportion thereof which has constructively gone to New York shall\r\n  be determined upon the following basis:\r\n\r\n  The total amount of oil transported in any month by the railroad\r\n  company to New York shall be compared with fifty (50) per centum of\r\n  the total oil which the railroad company is entitled to carry in\r\n  said month under the aforesaid other agreement. If the amount which\r\n  has been in such month carried by cars to New York shall be less\r\n  than fifty (50) per centum, then the difference shall be considered\r\n  as having been moved by the pipe to New York, at New York rates, and\r\n  shall be accounted for accordingly. The remainder of the oil _via_\r\n  Milton shall be accounted for at Philadelphia rates.\r\n\r\n  This contract shall commence and terminate simultaneously with said\r\n  other contract.\r\n\r\n  Witness the corporate seals of said parties duly attested the day\r\n  and date above written.\r\n\r\n                       THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY,\r\n                [L.S.] By FRANK THOMSON, _President_.\r\n               Attest: JOHN C.

Scofield\r\n  _et al._, in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio,\r\n  1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The said plaintiff, the Standard Oil Company, now comes and says\r\n  that on the twentieth day of July, A.D. 1876, it was and still is a\r\n  corporation organised and existing under and by virtue of the laws\r\n  of the state of Ohio, and that at the same time the said defendants,\r\n  William C. Scofield, Charles W. Scofield, Daniel Shurmer and John\r\n  Teagle, were and still are partners doing business in the firm name\r\n  of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle, and the said plaintiff complains of\r\n  the said defendants, and says: That on the said twentieth day of\r\n  July, A.D. 1876, the said plaintiff and the said defendants as such\r\n  partners were each separately engaged in the business of refining\r\n  and dealing in crude petroleum and its products, said plaintiff\r\n  having a number of refining establishments at Cleveland, Ohio, and\r\n  the said defendants owning and operating one refinery only, also\r\n  located at Cleveland, Ohio, on the line of the Atlantic and Great\r\n  Western Railroad, and while so engaged and on the said twentieth day\r\n  of July, A.D. 1876, the said plaintiff and the said defendants as\r\n  such partners entered into a joint arrangement in writing in and by\r\n  which it was, amongst other things, agreed between the said\r\n  plaintiff and the said defendants individually and as such partners\r\n  that the said defendants would continue their then business in the\r\n  firm name of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle of buying, refining and\r\n  selling crude petroleum and its products as theretofore carried on\r\n  by them, for a period of ten years from July 20, A.D. 1876, and\r\n  furnish for the conducting of said business their refinery aforesaid\r\n  with all tanks, fixtures, buildings, erections, tools, and all\r\n  mechanical appliances then or theretofore used by them in their said\r\n  business, together with the land on which the same are situated, and\r\n  also within five days from the date of said agreement furnish for\r\n  the use of said joint business adventure the sum of ten thousand\r\n  dollars in cash to be used continuously in said business until July\r\n  20, A.D. 1886. That the said William C. Scofield, Charles W.\r\n  Scofield, Daniel Shurmer and John Teagle, in and by said agreement\r\n  for conducting said joint adventure, further covenanted and agreed\r\n  with the plaintiff to devote all their time and personal attention\r\n  necessary to conduct the said business for the period aforesaid, and\r\n  that during the existence of said adventure they would not nor would\r\n  either of them as a firm or as individuals directly or indirectly\r\n  engage or be concerned in any business connected with petroleum or\r\n  any of its products in Cuyahoga County or elsewhere, except in\r\n  connection with the parties of the first part under this agreement,\r\n  nor would they or either of them enter into any new business which\r\n  would interfere with the time necessary to be devoted to the full\r\n  and faithful conduct of the business of said adventure.\r\n\r\n  That the said William C. Scofield, Charles W. Scofield, Daniel\r\n  Shurmer and John Teagle, in and by said agreement for conducting\r\n  said joint adventure, further covenanted and agreed with said\r\n  plaintiff that the amount of crude petroleum to be distilled by them\r\n  in the business of said adventure should not exceed annually\r\n  eighty-five thousand barrels of forty-two gallons each in any year,\r\n  but the same should be distributed as nearly as practicable in equal\r\n  quantities of 42,500 barrels of forty-two gallons each, each and\r\n  every six months from the twentieth day of July, A.D. 1876, but the\r\n  said 42,500 barrels might be run in a less period than six months.\r\n\r\n  That in and by said agreement for conducting the business of said\r\n  joint adventure it was stipulated and agreed by both parties,\r\n  amongst other things, that from the net profits of the business of\r\n  said joint adventure the said defendants should first be entitled to\r\n  retain and be paid the sum of $35,000 per annum while the said\r\n  agreement was in force and operation, and in the case the net\r\n  profits should not amount to $35,000 for any year that said\r\n  agreement for conducting said joint adventure was in force and\r\n  operation, then at the expiration of any such year the plaintiff\r\n  should on demand pay to the said defendants a sum of money\r\n  sufficient to make that amount, viz., $35,000 for any year that said\r\n  agreement should be in force and operation. That all net profits\r\n  over the amount of $35,000 so stipulated to belong to said\r\n  defendants annually should belong and be paid to said plaintiff\r\n  until the plaintiff should receive therefrom as much as said\r\n  defendants had received from the net profits under the provisions of\r\n  said agreement, and all net profits in excess of $70,000 annually\r\n  should be divided equally between the parties thereto.\r\n\r\n  That in consideration thereof and in and by said agreement for\r\n  conducting said joint adventure, the said plaintiff stipulated and\r\n  agreed with the said defendants, amongst other things, that on or\r\n  before the twenty-fifth day of July, A.D. 1876, it would furnish to\r\n  the said defendants for them to use in the business of said joint\r\n  adventure the sum of $10,000 in cash, which sum was so paid in as\r\n  agreed and still remains in the business.\r\n\r\n  That the said plaintiff would receive, dock, and sell in the city of\r\n  New York all oil and the products of petroleum consigned to it for\r\n  sale at New York by said firm of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle at\r\n  actual cost of brokerage and handling without commissions.\r\n\r\n  That the said plaintiff would and did in said agreement guarantee to\r\n  the said defendants that their share of the net profits arising from\r\n  the business of said joint adventure should for ten years from July\r\n  20, A.D. 1876, to July 20, A.D. 1886, amount to the sum of $35,000\r\n  annually, during the operation of this contract, as hereinbefore\r\n  stated. The plaintiff further says that between July 20, 1876, and\r\n  the present time, the said defendants have repeatedly violated their\r\n  said agreement in this, to wit: that every year since the making of\r\n  said agreement the said defendants have distilled over 85,000\r\n  barrels of crude petroleum; that during the year from July 20, 1876,\r\n  to July 20, 1877, they distilled 89,983.34–42 barrels; that during\r\n  the year from July 20, 1877, to July 20, 1878, they distilled\r\n  87,754.4–42 barrels; that during the year from July 20, 1878, to\r\n  July 20, 1879, they distilled 100,246.25–42 barrels, and from July\r\n  20, 1879, to July 20, 1880, they distilled 90,082.34–42 barrels.\r\n\r\n  That up to the present time the defendants have distilled more than\r\n  by the terms of their said agreement they have a right to distil up\r\n  to January 20, 1881, and have purchased large quantities of crude\r\n  petroleum and are distilling portions thereof, and threaten to\r\n  distil the balance without regarding their said contract. That the\r\n  crude petroleum so as aforesaid distilled by the defendants has not\r\n  by them been distributed as nearly as practicable in equal\r\n  quantities of 42,500 barrels of forty-two gallons each, each and\r\n  every six months as they agreed to do, but in violation of their\r\n  said agreement they distilled from July 20, 1876, to January, 1,\r\n  1877, 43,509.36–42 barrels; from January 1, 1877, to July 20, 1877,\r\n  46,473.40–42 barrels; from July 20, 1877, to January 1, 1878,\r\n  50,416.12–42 barrels; from January 1, 1878, to July 20, 1878,\r\n  37,337.34–42 barrels; from July 20, 1878, to January 1, 1879,\r\n  56,974.15–42 barrels; from January 1, 1879, to July 20, 1879,\r\n  43,272.10–42 barrels; from July 20, 1879, to January 1, 1880,\r\n  57,499.35–42 barrels; that on or about the twentieth day of July,\r\n  1879, the plaintiff having discovered that the said defendants had\r\n  in violation of said agreement distilled about 22,984 barrels of oil\r\n  more than they were entitled to by the terms of said agreement, the\r\n  plaintiff objected and complained to the defendants in regard\r\n  thereto, and thereupon the defendants admitted the violation of the\r\n  contract in that respect, and it was agreed between the parties that\r\n  the defendants would and should during the then coming year diminish\r\n  their manufacture sufficiently to bring the entire amount of\r\n  manufacture under said contract within the terms of said agreement.\r\n\r\n  That during the then coming year from July 20, 1879, to July 20,\r\n  1880, the said defendants did not diminish their distillation below\r\n  the 85,000 barrels as they had agreed to do, but from July 20, 1879,\r\n  to January 1, 1880, they distilled 57,499.35–42 barrels, and from\r\n  January 1, 1880, to July 20, 1880, they distilled 32,582.41–42\r\n  barrels, making a total of 90,082.34–42 barrels for the year, thus\r\n  increasing their distillation over the 85,000 barrels 5,082 barrels,\r\n  instead of diminishing it as they had agreed to do.\r\n\r\n  That the defendants threaten to and have informed the plaintiff that\r\n  they will hereafter wholly disregard said contract and continue to\r\n  distil crude petroleum without regard to quantity.\r\n\r\n  The plaintiff further says that since the making of said agreement\r\n  and within the past year the said Daniel Shurmer and John Teagle\r\n  have in violation of their said contract engaged and been connected\r\n  in constructing a refinery at Buffalo, New York, for the purpose of\r\n  distilling crude petroleum with others than the plaintiff under said\r\n  agreement and are now so engaged.\r\n\r\n  That within the past year the said Daniel Shurmer and John Teagle\r\n  and each of them have invested money to the amount of $10,000, and\r\n  are now engaged and connected in constructing refineries for the\r\n  purpose of distilling crude petroleum and its products with others\r\n  in no way connected with the plaintiff or under said agreement, but\r\n  intending thereby to establish and prosecute with others the same\r\n  business as that contemplated and conducted under said agreement,\r\n  and thereby establishing and conducting a rival business to the\r\n  business of said adventure and tending to involve the plaintiff in\r\n  loss by reason of its guarantee that the profits of said adventure\r\n  should amount to the sum of $35,000 annually to defendants, and have\r\n  during the past year been at said Buffalo and other places giving\r\n  the said business their time and personal attention, and have done\r\n  so at times when their time and personal attention was needed and\r\n  was requisite to properly conduct the business of said adventure\r\n  under said agreement at Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  The plaintiff further says that because of the said failures and\r\n  refusals of the defendants to carry out their said agreement it has\r\n  already sustained great damage and will sustain further damage if\r\n  the said defendants are permitted to continue their said violation\r\n  of said agreement. That the said plaintiff has no adequate remedy\r\n  therefor at law for the reason that the damages arising therefrom\r\n  are so remote and difficult of ascertainment, and constantly\r\n  recurring would necessitate a multiplicity of suits and would\r\n  involve the plaintiff in the increased hazards of losses arising\r\n  from such increased manufacture and deprive it of all the benefits\r\n  of said contract.\r\n\r\n  The plaintiff therefore prays that the said William C. Scofield,\r\n  Charles W. Scofield, Daniel Shurmer and John Teagle may by proper\r\n  process be made defendants herein and compelled to answer this\r\n  petition; that a preliminary injunction and restraining order be\r\n  granted restraining the said William C. Scofield, Charles W.\r\n  Scofield, Daniel Shurmer and John Teagle, and each of them\r\n  individually and as partners in the name of Scofield, Shurmer and\r\n  Teagle, until the further order of the court, from distilling at\r\n  their said works at Cleveland, Ohio, more than 85,000 barrels of\r\n  crude petroleum of forty-two gallons each in every year, and also\r\n  from distilling more than 42,500 barrels of crude petroleum of\r\n  forty-two gallons each, each and every six months, and also from\r\n  distilling any more crude petroleum until the expiration of six\r\n  months from and after July 20, 1880, and also from directly or\r\n  indirectly engaging in or being concerned in any business connected\r\n  with petroleum or any of its products, except in connection with the\r\n  plaintiff under their said agreement, and that on the final hearing\r\n  of this case the said defendants may in like manner be restrained\r\n  and enjoined from doing any of said acts until the expiration of\r\n  said agreement, and for such other and further relief in the\r\n  premises as equity can give.\r\n\r\n                                          M.

SCOFIELD _ET AL._\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the case of the Standard Oil Company _vs._ William C. Scofield\r\n  _et al._, in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio,\r\n  1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  That the so-called agreement is and at all times has been utterly\r\n  void and of no effect, as being by its terms in restraint of trade\r\n  and against public policy.\r\n\r\n  These defendants further say that they deny that through any action\r\n  of theirs said plaintiff has sustained or will sustain any damage\r\n  whatever, but these defendants say that their business of distilling\r\n  oil has been carried on at a large profit, and that the same is now\r\n  attended with large profits, and the price of refined oil is now so\r\n  high, and there is such a large margin between the price of crude\r\n  oil and refined, that the manufacture and sale of refined oil is\r\n  attended with large profit; that it is impossible to supply the\r\n  demand of the public for oil if the business and refineries of both\r\n  plaintiff and defendant are carried on and run to their full\r\n  capacity, and if the business of defendants were stopped as prayed\r\n  for by plaintiff it would result in a still higher price for refined\r\n  oil and the establishment of more perfect monopoly in the\r\n  manufacture and sale of the same by plaintiff.\r\n\r\n  These defendants further say that said plaintiff has constantly and\r\n  persistently violated the terms of said so-called written agreement\r\n  in that it has intentionally failed to give and has withheld from\r\n  the defendants the benefits of the advantages therein agreed to be\r\n  given, and that it has not given to defendants the benefits of its\r\n  contracts relating to freight on crude and refined oil, but these\r\n  defendants have been constantly required to pay more and larger\r\n  freights than said plaintiff, and that said plaintiff has not\r\n  allowed to defendants the same rebate that it has received with\r\n  different carriers; and, further, that said plaintiff has recently\r\n  constructed a pipe-line to the Oil Regions of Pennsylvania through\r\n  which its oil has been pumped to Cleveland at an expense of about\r\n  twelve cents a barrel, but has charged defendants for pumping their\r\n  oil through the same pipe twenty cents per barrel.\r\n\r\n  The defendants further say that at the time when said writing was\r\n  signed said plaintiff was endeavouring by contracts with divers\r\n  persons to establish a monopoly in the manufacture of refined oil in\r\n  the state of Ohio and in the United States, and that, for the\r\n  purpose of monopolising the trade in refined oil and enhancing the\r\n  price thereof, and maintaining an unnaturally high price, said\r\n  plaintiff entered into said so-called agreement under the form of a\r\n  joint arrangement or adventure, and for no other purpose, and\r\n  contributed to the capital of said so-called adventure the sum of\r\n  $10,000, whereas those defendants contributed thereto the sum of\r\n  $73,000 and their time and attention, and their refinery had the\r\n  capacity for refining 180,000 barrels of crude oil per year, as\r\n  plaintiff well knew, and said plaintiff thereby, and by said other\r\n  contracts made with the same design, succeeded in creating a\r\n  substantial monopoly and averting competition and maintaining an\r\n  unnaturally high price for refined oil, and that said so-called\r\n  agreement is therefore in restraint of trade and against public\r\n  policy, and void.\r\n\r\n  These defendants further say that defendants have from time to time\r\n  paid to plaintiff their full share of the profits of said so-called\r\n  adventure, and at no time has plaintiff been required to pay any sum\r\n  whatever to defendants, but has realised large profits from said\r\n  business, and on the fourth day of March, 1880, with full knowledge\r\n  of how much oil in excess of 85,000 barrels per year had been\r\n  manufactured by defendants, demanded of said defendants that they\r\n  should pay to plaintiff the entire profits upon said excess, and\r\n  claimed that its monopoly was so perfect that it would have sold\r\n  said excess if defendants had not, and defendants did pay to\r\n  plaintiff the one-half of the profits on said excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 44 (See page 2071)\r\n                    AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the case of the Standard Oil Company _vs._ William C. Scofield\r\n  _et al._, in the Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio,\r\n  1880.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  John D. Rockefeller being duly sworn, says that for about eighteen\r\n  years past he has been engaged in the business of refining crude\r\n  petroleum; that from about the year 1863 to 1870 he was engaged as a\r\n  member of firms in such refining, and from January, 1870, he has\r\n  been and still is engaged in such refining business as president of\r\n  said plaintiff, the Standard Oil Company; that during said time he\r\n  has given the business personal attention and has thereby become\r\n  familiar with the general business of refining crude petroleum, with\r\n  the amount of crude petroleum produced, with the amount of crude\r\n  petroleum refined, so far as the same can be ascertained, and\r\n  especially with the business of the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says the said Standard Oil Company owns and operates its\r\n  refineries at Cleveland, Ohio, and its refinery at Bayonne, New\r\n  Jersey; that it has no other refineries nor any interest in any\r\n  other refineries, nor does the Standard Oil Company operate or\r\n  control in the United States any other refineries of crude\r\n  petroleum; that there are in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New\r\n  York, and New Jersey a large number of refineries of crude petroleum\r\n  that are not owned or controlled by said Standard Oil Company, and\r\n  in which the said Standard Oil Company has no interest whatever,\r\n  directly or indirectly, which are now and for years past have been\r\n  refining crude petroleum and selling it in the open market; that the\r\n  amount of crude petroleum refined by the said Standard Oil Company\r\n  does not exceed thirty-three per cent. of the total amount refined\r\n  in the United States.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that the capacity of all the refineries in the\r\n  United States is more than sufficient to supply the markets of the\r\n  world, and in the judgment of affiant if all the refineries were run\r\n  to their full capacity they would refine at least twice as much oil\r\n  as the markets of the world require; that this difference between\r\n  the capacity of refineries and the demands of the market has existed\r\n  for at least seven years past, and during that period the refineries\r\n  of the Standard Oil Company have not been run to their full\r\n  capacity, and in the judgment of affiant not to exceed one-half of\r\n  their capacity.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that during all the period of time that he has\r\n  been engaged in the business of refining oil he has been familiar\r\n  with the price of crude oil and with the price of refined oil and\r\n  with the profits to be derived therefrom, and from such experience\r\n  he states that the average price of refined oil and the average\r\n  profits to the manufacturer per gallon on same since 1876 have been\r\n  much less than the average profit for several years previous to\r\n  1876; that said Standard Oil Company has no means now and never has\r\n  had any of influencing the price of refined oil, save by the sale of\r\n  its product in the open market.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that the Standard Oil Company has not nor did\r\n  it ever have any interest in any oil property or any control over\r\n  the production of crude petroleum; that it does not own any oil\r\n  wells or land producing oil, and never did; nor has it any control\r\n  over the price of crude petroleum, but relies upon obtaining its\r\n  supplies, as all others do, by purchase in the open market and at\r\n  the prices paid by others at the same time; that the said Standard\r\n  Oil Company is not now nor has it ever been a stockholder in any\r\n  railroad, pipe-line, or other common carrier for the transportation\r\n  of oil, but within the year past it has for its own convenience\r\n  constructed, and owns and is now operating, a pipe-line from\r\n  Cleveland to the western line of the state of Pennsylvania for the\r\n  purpose of bringing oil to its refineries at Cleveland; that said\r\n  pipe-line is now insufficient to supply the demands of the Standard\r\n  Oil Company for crude oil for its own refineries, and for that\r\n  reason it has been and is now compelled to bring crude oil to\r\n  Cleveland in cars to supply its wants.\r\n\r\n  That from the deponent’s experience in business he knows it to be\r\n  true that a large manufacturer always has an advantage in cheapness\r\n  of manufacture over a small manufacturer; that all the advantages\r\n  derived by the Standard Oil Company are legitimate business\r\n  advantages, due to the very large volume of supplies which it\r\n  purchases, its long continuance in the business, the experience it\r\n  has thereby acquired, the knowledge of all the avenues of trade, the\r\n  skill of experienced employees, the possession and use of all the\r\n  latest and most valuable mechanical improvements, appliances and\r\n  processes for the distillation of crude oil, and in the manufacture\r\n  of its own barrels, glue, etc., etc., by reason of which it is\r\n  enabled to put the oil on the market at a cost of manufacture much\r\n  less than by others not having equal advantages. These advantages,\r\n  by reason of which the Standard Oil Company is enabled to refine oil\r\n  cheaper than smaller manufacturers, are not exclusive to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, but are open to every person doing business\r\n  under similar circumstances. That this state of facts has been\r\n  detrimental to smaller refineries and has prevented them from making\r\n  as much profit as they desired, and in some cases compelled them to\r\n  suspend refining, and this constitutes the only foundation for the\r\n  oft-repeated expressions “crushed out,” “squeezed out,” and\r\n  “bulldozing.”\r\n\r\n  Affiant says he has examined the answer of the defendants, Shurmer\r\n  and Teagle, and his attention has been called to various statements\r\n  contained in it. In regard to the statement made therein that “if\r\n  the business of the defendants were stopped as prayed for by\r\n  plaintiff, it would result in a still higher price for refined oil\r\n  and the establishment of a more perfect monopoly in the manufacture\r\n  and sale of the same by plaintiff.” The same is untrue, as there is\r\n  not, never has been, and never can be a monopoly in the manufacture\r\n  of refined oil, nor has the limitation in said agreement as to\r\n  quantity to be manufactured affected, nor will the stoppage by the\r\n  defendants of their manufacture, as prayed for in plaintiff’s\r\n  petition, in the least affect the price of refined oil, for the\r\n  reason that leaving out the entire capacity of the refinery of\r\n  defendants there would still remain a large excess of capacity for\r\n  supplying all the demands of the public, and hence there would be no\r\n  opportunity for advancing the price, nor would it tend to create a\r\n  monopoly of the business by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further says that it is not true that the said plaintiff has\r\n  at any time or in any manner violated the terms of said agreement as\r\n  alleged in said answer or in any other manner. That it is not true\r\n  that plaintiff has intentionally or otherwise withheld from the\r\n  defendants the benefit of the advantages agreed upon in said\r\n  contract to be given them, nor is it true that the plaintiff has not\r\n  given to defendants the benefit of its contracts relating to freight\r\n  on crude and refined oil, but the plaintiff has given to the\r\n  defendants privileges not required by the agreement. That it is not\r\n  true that the defendants have ever been required to pay larger rates\r\n  of freight than were paid by the plaintiff when the defendants made\r\n  any shipments of oil in accordance with the terms of the contract;\r\n  nor is it true that the plaintiff has not allowed to defendants the\r\n  same rebates that it has received from different carriers upon any\r\n  shipments of oil made in accordance with the terms of the contract.\r\n\r\n  That it is true that the plaintiff has recently constructed a\r\n  pipe-line from Cleveland to the western line of the state of\r\n  Pennsylvania, through which its oil has been pumped to Cleveland\r\n  since the spring of 1880, but it is not true that it is the owner of\r\n  the said pipe-line from the western line of the state of\r\n  Pennsylvania to the Oil Regions. That it is true that to promote the\r\n  interest of the defendants, the plaintiff has furnished to\r\n  defendants crude oil through said pipe-line and charged them twenty\r\n  cents per barrel for the transportation of same; but it is not true\r\n  that said pipe-line was constructed for the purpose of transporting\r\n  oil for others than the plaintiff, nor is it true that under the\r\n  terms of said agreement the defendants are entitled to the\r\n  transportation of oil through said pipe-line, nor is it true that\r\n  the charge of twenty cents per barrel is an unreasonable price for\r\n  transporting oil through said pipe-line from the Oil Regions to\r\n  Cleveland; but affiant avers it to be true that during the time it\r\n  so furnished the oil through the pipe-line at twenty cents per\r\n  barrel, of forty-two gallons each, the railroads were charging\r\n  freight at the rate of from thirty-five to fifty cents per barrel,\r\n  of forty-five gallons each.\r\n\r\n  Plaintiff continued to deliver defendants through the pipe-line, and\r\n  at twenty cents per barrel, until they had received all they were\r\n  entitled to manufacture under the contract dated July 20, 1876.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that it is not true that “at the time when said\r\n  agreement was signed, said plaintiff was endeavouring by contracts\r\n  with divers persons to establish a monopoly in the manufacture of\r\n  refined oil in the state of Ohio and in the United States.” Affiant\r\n  avers that it has made but one other contract with other persons\r\n  like the one made with defendants, and that was a contract made at\r\n  the same date, viz., July 20, 1876, with the Pioneer Oil Company of\r\n  the City of Cleveland, of which the defendants had full knowledge.\r\n  Affiant further says that he was present and participated in the\r\n  negotiations which resulted in the formation of the contract with\r\n  these defendants, and that it is not true that said contract was\r\n  entered into for the purpose of monopolising the trade in refined\r\n  oil or for the purpose of enhancing the price thereof and\r\n  maintaining an unnaturally high price for the same; and affiant says\r\n  that it is not true that plaintiff by said contract, and by the said\r\n  other contract made with the same design, succeeded in creating a\r\n  substantial monopoly and averting competition, and maintaining an\r\n  unnaturally high price for refined oil; but said contract was made,\r\n  as is therein stated, for the purpose of equalising the business of\r\n  manufacturing oil and giving to each of said contracting parties\r\n  their due proportion thereof, and that the amount of 85,000 barrels\r\n  per annum to which the distillation of defendants is by said\r\n  contract limited is, as agreed, a relative proportion to their full\r\n  capacity, as is the amount distilled by plaintiff per annum since\r\n  said contract was entered into to its total capacity for refining\r\n  oil; and it is not true that said agreement is in restraint of trade\r\n  and against public policy, as alleged in the said answer of\r\n  defendants, Shurmer and Teagle. Affiant says that on or about the\r\n  first day of October, 1879, it came to his knowledge that the\r\n  defendants had, in violation of said agreement, distilled about\r\n  22,984 barrels of oil more than they were entitled to by the terms\r\n  of said agreement, and thereupon he had an interview with\r\n  defendants, W. C. Scofield and John Teagle, who admitted the\r\n  defendants had distilled in excess of the quantity stipulated in the\r\n  contract, and agreed to reduce the quantity distilled during the\r\n  year following, July 20, 1879, by the amount they had already\r\n  distilled in excess up to that date, but requested they might be\r\n  allowed to distribute said reduction equally over each six months of\r\n  the year instead of wholly in either the first or last six months of\r\n  the year following July 20, 1879, to which request affiant assented.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that it is not true that “the plaintiff, on the fourth\r\n  day of March, 1880, with full knowledge of how much oil in excess of\r\n  85,000 barrels per year had been manufactured by defendants and\r\n  plaintiff, demanded of said defendants that they should pay to\r\n  plaintiff the entire profits upon said excess,” other than as is\r\n  hereinafter stated; and it is not true that plaintiff, at the time\r\n  it demanded said profits, claimed that it had any monopoly, or that\r\n  its monopoly was so perfect that it would have sold said excess if\r\n  defendants had not, or that it was entitled to said profits in\r\n  consequence of any monopoly; but affiant says that it did claim the\r\n  profits upon the oil sold in excess of said 85,000 barrels, because\r\n  defendants had broken their agreement with said plaintiff, and the\r\n  profits on such excess the plaintiff at that time was willing to\r\n  accept as compensation for such breach of said contract.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that he does not know what contracts for the sale of\r\n  oil defendants may have made, or what contracts for the manufacture\r\n  or for the construction of barrels they may have entered into, or\r\n  what obligations they may be under to their customers; but he says\r\n  that for a long time past the defendants have had notice that\r\n  plaintiff would insist upon the performance by them of their\r\n  obligations under their said contract, and that if they have entered\r\n  into contracts for the sale of oil as alleged by them and entered\r\n  into other obligations, they have done so with the full knowledge\r\n  that they were thereby violating and continuing the violation of\r\n  said agreement of July 20, 1876.\r\n\r\n  I have read the affidavit of H. L. Taylor, filed in this case\r\n  October 18, 1880, in which he says “that he has been for some six or\r\n  eight years last past acquainted with Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Flagler,\r\n  Mr. Payne, and others; that he has had conversations with some of\r\n  these parties with regard to the control by the Standard Oil Company\r\n  of the distilling and refining business in the state of Ohio and in\r\n  the United States, and that he has heard them say in substance that\r\n  the Standard Oil Company intended to wipe out all the refineries in\r\n  the country except theirs, and to control the entire refining\r\n  business in the United States.” Affiant says that he has been\r\n  acquainted with H. L. Taylor for several years past, that all the\r\n  foregoing statements so far as they relate to him are false, and\r\n  that he never made to said Taylor or to any person in his hearing\r\n  any such statement, nor statements in substance to that effect.\r\n  Affiant further says that he never in company with said Taylor\r\n  visited any of the cities or places mentioned in his affidavit for\r\n  the purpose of inspecting or examining refineries, though he may\r\n  have met said Taylor incidentally at various places, but that he\r\n  never showed him refineries that were formerly under the control of\r\n  others and running independently and stated that the same had passed\r\n  under the control of the Standard Oil Company, nor did anybody else\r\n  make such statements to Taylor in his hearing.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that it has not come to pass, as sworn to by said\r\n  Taylor, that said Standard Oil Company has “wiped out” the refining\r\n  business of the United States or that it to-day controls it, but\r\n  affiant believes that at the time said Taylor made his affidavit he\r\n  knew there were very many refineries running independently of and in\r\n  no way connected with the Standard Oil Company, and that said Taylor\r\n  was himself then interested in the profits of a large refining\r\n  business represented by a number of refiners who were large\r\n  competitors of the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the assertion of said Taylor that “in many instances\r\n  to his knowledge the Standard Oil Company has bought refineries and\r\n  taken them down,” affiant says that several years ago when the\r\n  business was very much scattered, in several instances and for\r\n  greater economy in manufacturing, the Standard Oil Company\r\n  dismantled refineries unfavourably located and utilised the\r\n  construction, machinery, and appliances of the same to increase its\r\n  manufactory at Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  It is true that in many cases persons who had been unsuccessfully\r\n  engaged in refining, but had experience, were to some extent\r\n  employed by the Standard Oil Company in its business of refining,\r\n  but that with respect to the averment in said Taylor’s affidavit\r\n  that “in other cases said company employed men who had refineries,\r\n  at large salaries and at the same time gave them no absolute\r\n  employment,” the same is untrue. But it is true that it has\r\n  restricted its employees from entering the business of refining and\r\n  distilling oil except under said company’s direction.\r\n\r\n  But none of these things were done by the plaintiff for the purpose\r\n  of creating and maintaining a monopoly of the business of refining,\r\n  but were done for the purpose of conducting its business more\r\n  efficiently.\r\n\r\n  And affiant says that it is not true, as sworn to by said Taylor,\r\n  that the Standard Oil Company during a large portion of the time\r\n  that he refers to, to wit, six or eight years past, or for any\r\n  length of time, has substantially controlled the transportation of\r\n  oil; that it is not true that said Standard Oil Company ever had, or\r\n  that it now has, any contract with any lines of transportation in\r\n  which it was stipulated that it should have a lower rate of freight\r\n  than other shippers undertaking the same obligations and furnishing\r\n  equal terminal facilities; that in all the contracts ever had with\r\n  the railroads, the railroad companies have reserved the right to\r\n  charge others the same rate of freight as that paid by the Standard\r\n  Oil Company; and affiant further says that even those contracts with\r\n  the railroad companies which gave the Standard Oil Company a\r\n  commission for facilities furnished have long been abrogated and\r\n  abandoned.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that with respect to the statement in said Taylor’s\r\n  affidavit that “other language has been used to him—said Taylor—by\r\n  the officers of said Standard Oil Company to the effect that the\r\n  said company intended to have all the refineries and aimed at having\r\n  entire control of the oil market,” the same, so far as it related to\r\n  him, is wholly untrue.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that it is not true that the plaintiff got control of\r\n  the refineries of the firm of Logan Brothers of Philadelphia, Octave\r\n  Oil Company, Easterly and Davis, and Bennett, Warner and Company of\r\n  Titusville, Pennsylvania; R. S. Waring and Citizens’ Oil Works of\r\n  Pittsburg, or of either of them. The statement of H. L. Taylor that\r\n  “the principal way by which these independent refineries came under\r\n  the control of the Standard Oil Company was from the fact that said\r\n  company had such rates of transportation that the small companies\r\n  could not compete with it, and when said company had such in its\r\n  power it would make such arrangements with parties engaged in these\r\n  refineries as would prevent them from thereafter competing with the\r\n  Standard Oil Company,” is false in its facts and its inferences.\r\n  Affiant has already correctly stated the facts as to the purchase of\r\n  refineries by the Standard Oil Company of Cleveland, what led to\r\n  such purchases, and that persons engaged in such refineries were in\r\n  some cases employed by said company; and any statement or inference\r\n  to the effect that by illegal means or unfair influences the\r\n  plaintiff “squeezed out” or “crushed out” small refiners and\r\n  prevented them from again entering into the business of refining, is\r\n  untrue.\r\n\r\n  Affiant further responding to the affidavit of said Taylor, says\r\n  that with reference to the statement therein contained that “the\r\n  effect of the control of the refining business by the Standard Oil\r\n  Company upon the oil market is to largely increase the price to\r\n  consumers beyond what they ought to pay,” the same is untrue, and he\r\n  avers again that since the date of the contract with defendants the\r\n  average price to consumers of refined oil has been lower than for\r\n  years previous.\r\n\r\n  As to the allegation of said Taylor that “if the business was\r\n  distributed among the independent refineries it would furnish\r\n  employment to a much larger number of persons than at present, and\r\n  the interests of the country would be decidedly promoted by having\r\n  the refining business in the hands of competent parties,” in so far\r\n  as the same implies that there are not independent competing\r\n  refineries outside of the works of said plaintiff, the same is\r\n  untrue, and that it is a fact that a larger number of persons are\r\n  now employed in connection with the business of refining oil than\r\n  ever before.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that with reference to the language used by the said\r\n  Heisel in his affidavit that he, Heisel, was not afraid, to which\r\n  Mr. Rockefeller replied, “You may not be afraid to have your head\r\n  cut off, but your body will suffer,” “and that this was said by\r\n  affiant prior to the time that he sold his interest in the refining\r\n  business to Bishop and was said for the purpose of inducing affiant\r\n  to sell out to the Standard Oil Company,” that affiant has no\r\n  recollection of ever using any such language to said Heisel, and so\r\n  far as said statement implies threats or inducements held out to\r\n  said Heisel to procure the control of the works of Bishop and Heisel\r\n  by the Standard Oil Company, the same is wholly false in spirit and\r\n  effect.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says respecting the statement in said Heisel’s affidavit,\r\n  that “the effect resulting from the control by this one company—the\r\n  Standard Oil Company—of the entire refining business in Cleveland\r\n  has been to largely increase the price of refined oil to consumers,\r\n  to lessen its production, to reduce the number of hands employed in\r\n  the refining business, and to reduce the price paid labourers for\r\n  their work, and thereby to largely injure the public,” the same, so\r\n  far as it alleges that there is a control by the Standard Oil\r\n  Company of the entire refining business, is false; and that so far\r\n  as it undertakes to state consequences of said alleged control by\r\n  the Standard Oil Company, it is also false.\r\n\r\n  I have read the affidavit of Mrs. B. filed in this case on October\r\n  18, 1880. Said affidavit is incorrect, erroneous and in many\r\n  respects false.\r\n\r\n  The first interview that I ever had with Mrs. B. was at her house,\r\n  when she sent for Mr. Flagler and myself to consult with her in\r\n  reference to selling out her establishment to one of her employees.\r\n  This occurred during the year 1876. She stated to us the terms of an\r\n  offer that she had received from the said employee, and expressed an\r\n  earnest desire to dispose of the business and to be free from its\r\n  perplexities and annoyances, and evinced a disposition to accept the\r\n  offer, and we advised her to accept providing the payments were made\r\n  secure. I did not see her again until the fall of 1878, more than\r\n  two years later. Then at her urgent request I met her at her house,\r\n  at which time she made reference to the conversation she had had\r\n  with Mr. Jennings, and desired me to pursue negotiations with her\r\n  with reference to the sale of her property, which I positively\r\n  declined, stating to her that I knew nothing about her business or\r\n  the mechanical appliances used in the same, and that I could not\r\n  pursue any negotiations with her with reference to the same, but\r\n  that if, after reflection, she yet desired to do so, some of our\r\n  people familiar with the lubricating oil business would take up the\r\n  question with her. She was very desirous to begin negotiations, but\r\n  I declined to negotiate and advised her not to take any hasty\r\n  action, as from her own statements there was no such change in the\r\n  condition of the business as to discourage the expectation that she\r\n  could do as well in the future as she had in the past. When she\r\n  responded expressing her fears about the future of the business,\r\n  stating that she could not get cars to transport sufficient oil, and\r\n  other similar remarks, I stated to her that though we were using our\r\n  cars and required them in our own business, yet we would loan her\r\n  any number she required or do anything else in reason to assist her,\r\n  and I saw no reason why she could not prosecute her business just as\r\n  successfully in the future as in the past. This is the last\r\n  interview I had with her.\r\n\r\n  Affiant thinks it is true that Mrs. B. stated in the course of the\r\n  conversation in substance that “the B. Oil Company was entirely in\r\n  the power of the Standard Oil Company, and that all she could do\r\n  would be to appeal to affiant’s honour as a gentleman and to his\r\n  sympathy to do with her the best that he could do.” To the statement\r\n  that she was in the power of the Standard Oil Company, affiant made\r\n  a positive denial, and stated to her there was no foundation for the\r\n  fears she expressed, and in this connection made the offer to her to\r\n  furnish her with cars. He cannot remember what was said by Mrs. B.\r\n  at this interview in relation to an agreement upon the part of the\r\n  Standard Oil Company not to touch the lubricating branch of the\r\n  trade. It is true that the Standard Oil Company had a contract with\r\n  the B. Oil Company, made early in 1873, terminable on sixty days’\r\n  notice by either party, in reference to carbon oil only—which\r\n  contract had been voluntarily assumed by the B. Oil Company—and it\r\n  was entirely optional with the said B. Oil Company to discontinue\r\n  said contract upon a notice of sixty days and thereby relieve itself\r\n  from its obligations if it so desired; but said contract was\r\n  continued in full force and effect up to the time of the sale by\r\n  Mrs. B. of her interest in said B. Oil Company; but the Standard Oil\r\n  Company had no contract with B. Oil Company by which it “agreed not\r\n  to touch the lubricating branch of the trade,” nor did it have any\r\n  contract with the said B. Oil Company having reference in any\r\n  particular to the lubricating oil business, nor did affiant have any\r\n  such contract. While affiant declined to enter into a negotiation\r\n  with the said Mrs. B., it may be true that during the interview\r\n  alluded to he said to her that in case a sale were made she could\r\n  retain whatever stock in the B. Oil Company she desired. As a result\r\n  of the negotiations, in which affiant took no part, the construction\r\n  and good-will of the B. Oil Company was purchased for sixty thousand\r\n  dollars, which was at least twenty thousand dollars in excess of its\r\n  value, and largely in excess of the value placed upon it by Mrs. B.\r\n  in the interview above referred to between Mr. Flagler and affiant\r\n  with her in 1876. In addition to the construction and good-will\r\n  which was purchased for the sum of sixty thousand dollars, there was\r\n  purchased of the B. Oil Company its entire stock of oils on hand at\r\n  the full market value, and the sum paid for same amounted to\r\n  $19,144.49, making an aggregate of $79,144.49, and did not include\r\n  any other assets of the company, such as cash, accounts receivable\r\n  and accrued dividends.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the allegation in said affidavit that “Mrs. B.,\r\n  seeing that the property had to go, asked that she might, according\r\n  to the understanding with the president of the company, retain\r\n  fifteen thousand dollars of her stock,” so far as said statement\r\n  implies that she was parting with her property under any duress,\r\n  restraint, or undue influence, or was forced thereto by any acts of\r\n  the Standard Oil Company, the same is absolutely false; and it is\r\n  also false that she ever had any understanding with the president of\r\n  the Standard Oil Company that she should retain fifteen thousand\r\n  dollars of the stock of the B. Oil Company, nor was there any\r\n  reference to that subject save as is hereinbefore stated; and if the\r\n  said Mrs. B. refers to this affiant in that connection wherein she\r\n  says that “to this request the reply was, ‘No outsider can have any\r\n  interest in this concern’ and ‘that said Standard Oil Company had\r\n  dallied as long as it would over this matter, that it must be\r\n  settled up that day or go, and insisted upon her signing the bond\r\n  above referred to,’” the same is also false; nor has he any\r\n  knowledge that during said negotiation any such language was ever\r\n  used, or that the negotiations were ever carried on or closed in any\r\n  such spirit.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that it is not true that he made any promises that he\r\n  did not keep in the letter and spirit; and it is not true that he\r\n  was instrumental to any degree in her being obliged to sell the\r\n  property much below its true value; and he avers that she was not\r\n  obliged to sell out, and that such sale was a voluntary one upon her\r\n  part and for a sum far in excess of its value, and that the\r\n  construction which was purchased of her could be replaced for a sum\r\n  not exceeding twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n  On Saturday, the ninth day of November, 1878, the negotiations were\r\n  closed and payments made to Mrs. B. Affiant had no knowledge of\r\n  dissatisfaction upon her part until the receipt of a letter dated\r\n  Monday, November 11, which reached him on the 12th, and on November\r\n  13 the reply thereto was made, copy of which is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  November 13, 1878.\r\n\r\n    _Dear Madam_: I have held your note of 11th inst., received\r\n    yesterday, until to-day, as I wished to thoroughly review every\r\n    point connected with the negotiation for the purchase of the\r\n    stock of the B. Oil Company, to satisfy myself as to whether I\r\n    had unwittingly done anything whereby you would have any right\r\n    to feel injured. It is true that in the interview I had with you\r\n    I suggested that if you desired to do so you could retain an\r\n    interest in the business of the B. Oil Company by keeping some\r\n    number of its shares, and I then understood you to say that if\r\n    you sold out you wished to go entirely out of the business. That\r\n    being my understanding, our arrangements were made in case you\r\n    concluded to make the sale, that precluded any other interests\r\n    being represented, and therefore when you did make the inquiry\r\n    as to your taking some of the stock our answer was given in\r\n    accordance with the facts noted above, but not at all in the\r\n    spirit in which you refer to the refusal in your note. In regard\r\n    to the reference that you make as to my permitting the business\r\n    of the B. Oil Company to _be taken_ from you, I say that in\r\n    this, as in all else that you have written in your letter of\r\n    11th inst., you do me most grievous wrong. It was of but little\r\n    moment to the interests represented by me whether the business\r\n    of the B. Oil Company was purchased or not. I believe that it\r\n    was for your interest to make the sale, and am entirely candid\r\n    in this statement, and beg to call your attention to the time,\r\n    some two years ago, when you consulted Mr. Flagler and myself as\r\n    to selling out your interests to Mr. Rose, at which time you\r\n    were desirous of selling at _considerably less price_, and upon\r\n    time, than you have now received in cash, and which sale you\r\n    would have been glad to have closed if you could have obtained\r\n    satisfactory security for the deferred payments. As to the price\r\n    paid for the property, it is certainly three times greater than\r\n    the cost at which we could now construct equal or better\r\n    facilities; but wishing to take a liberal view of it, I urged\r\n    the proposal of paying the sixty thousand dollars, which was\r\n    thought much too high by some of our parties. I believe that if\r\n    you would reconsider what you have written in your letter, to\r\n    which this is a reply, you must admit having done me great\r\n    injustice, and I am satisfied to await upon your innate sense of\r\n    right for such admission. However, in view of what seems your\r\n    present feelings, I now offer to restore to you the purchase\r\n    made by us, you simply returning the amount of money which we\r\n    have invested and leaving us as though no purchase had been\r\n    made. Should you not desire to accept this proposal, I offer to\r\n    you one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred shares of the\r\n    stock at the same price that we paid for the same with, this\r\n    addition that if we keep the property we are under engagement to\r\n    pay into the treasury of the B. Oil Company an amount which,\r\n    added to the amount already paid, would make a total of\r\n    $100,000, and thereby make the shares one hundred dollars each.\r\n\r\n    That you may not be compelled to hastily come to conclusion, I\r\n    will leave open for three days these propositions for your\r\n    acceptance or declination, and in the meantime, believe me,\r\n\r\n                        Yours very truly,\r\n                                                JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To which letter no reply was ever received, and since which time\r\n  affiant has had no communication with Mrs. B. upon any subject.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that he has had his attention called to the affidavit\r\n  of Daniel Shurmer, filed in this case October 18, 1880, and to the\r\n  language as follows: “That the Standard Oil Company had already\r\n  squeezed out one refining concern with which he was connected,\r\n  whereby he had lost over twenty thousand dollars.” Affiant says that\r\n  the same is false, as nothing of the kind ever occurred.\r\n\r\n  Affiant says that he conducted most of the negotiations which led to\r\n  the making of the contract with defendants, and that at no time\r\n  previous or during the same were any threats made by him or any\r\n  officer of the Standard Oil Company or agent to his knowledge to the\r\n  effect that the firm of Scofield, Shurmer and Teagle would be ruined\r\n  if they did not make such a contract, and no promises were made by\r\n  him nor anybody else in behalf of said Standard Oil Company to said\r\n  Shurmer or any of the defendants, that if said contract was signed\r\n  the Standard Oil Company and defendants would control and monopolise\r\n  the whole refining business in Cleveland; nor is it true, as alleged\r\n  by said Shurmer, that he was reluctant to enter into said agreement,\r\n  but, so far as affiant knows, the said Shurmer was anxious to make\r\n  the arrangement, believing it to be a profitable one for the\r\n  defendants. That some time in the year 1872, when the refining\r\n  business of the City of Cleveland was in the hands of a number of\r\n  small refineries and was unproductive of profit, it was deemed\r\n  advisable by many of the persons engaged therein, for the sake of\r\n  economy, to concentrate the business and associate their joint\r\n  capital therein. The state of the business was such at that time\r\n  that it could not be retained profitably at the City of Cleveland by\r\n  reason of the fact that points nearer the Oil Regions were enjoying\r\n  privileges not shared by refiners at Cleveland, and could produce\r\n  refined oil at a much less rate than could be made at this point.\r\n  That it was a well-understood fact at that time among refiners that\r\n  some arrangement would have to be made to economise and concentrate\r\n  the business or ruinous losses would not only occur to the refiners\r\n  themselves, but ultimately Cleveland as a point of refining oil\r\n  would have to be abandoned. At that time those most prominently\r\n  engaged in the business here consulted together, and as a result\r\n  thereof several of the refiners conveyed to the plaintiff their\r\n  refineries and had the option in pay therefor to take stock in the\r\n  Standard Oil Company at par or to take cash. That at this time the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, by reason of its facilities and large cash\r\n  capital, was agreed upon as the one best adapted to concentrate the\r\n  business, and for no other reason whatsoever. That said Standard Oil\r\n  Company had no agency in creating this state of things which made\r\n  that change in the refining business necessary at that time, but the\r\n  same was the natural result of the trade; nor did it in the\r\n  negotiations which followed use any undue or unfair means, but in\r\n  all cases, to the general satisfaction of those whose refineries\r\n  were acquired, the full value thereof either in stock or cash was\r\n  paid, as the parties preferred.\r\n\r\n  Since that time the Standard Oil Company, by diligent and faithful\r\n  attention to its business, by the exercise of the most rigid\r\n  economy, by promptly taking advantage of all legitimate business\r\n  opportunities, has acquired large and valuable property at Cleveland\r\n  with a capacity to refine oil largely in excess of any local\r\n  refinery, but he denies that from 1872 to the present time, by any\r\n  conclusion, conspiracy, or undue means from first to last, the\r\n  present standing and capacity of the Standard Oil Company has been\r\n  acquired, or that it seeks to maintain its hold upon business\r\n  through any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly.\r\n\r\n                                                  JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 45 (See page 2072)\r\n                            FINDINGS OF FACT\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Transcript of record, Supreme Court of the United States, October\r\n  term, 1886. Number 1,290. The Lake Shore and Michigan Southern\r\n  Railway Company, plaintiff in error, _vs._ Scofield, Shurmer and\r\n  Teagle, in error to the Supreme Court of the state of Ohio, pages\r\n  14–21.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  This cause came on to be heard upon the pleadings, exhibits, and\r\n  testimony, and was argued by counsel; in consideration whereof the\r\n  plaintiffs, having moved for a reservation to the Supreme Court, the\r\n  judges are unanimously of opinion that important and difficult\r\n  questions exist in the case, making it proper that the same should\r\n  be reserved to the Supreme Court for decision, which questions\r\n  embrace the following propositions:\r\n\r\n  1st. Is this a case upon the face of the petition and under the laws\r\n  of the state in which the court ought to interfere by injunction?\r\n\r\n  2nd. Whether such remedy by injunction will apply as well to the\r\n  case of shipments over the defendants’ road alone, as to cases of\r\n  through shipments over such road and connecting roads?\r\n\r\n  3rd. What are the duties and obligations of common carriers at\r\n  common law as distinguished from the statutory provisions of this\r\n  and other states and countries?\r\n\r\n  4th. Are the defendants at common law obliged to carry freight at\r\n  the same price for all parties or members of the public, without\r\n  regard to quantity or circumstances connected with the\r\n  transportation?\r\n\r\n  5th. May the defendant, as a common carrier and a corporation\r\n  organised for that purpose, contract with a party controlling 90/100\r\n  or more of all the freight of a particular class, at a given city or\r\n  point, to carry the same for less than general tariff rates, in\r\n  consideration that it shall receive all the freight thus controlled\r\n  by such party?\r\n\r\n  6th. May the defendant, as a common carrier, in consideration of\r\n  receiving all the freight of such party, that the quantity shall not\r\n  be diminished, and that terminal facilities as to loading,\r\n  unloading, and delivering the freight shall be furnished different\r\n  from regular or usual freight and with less expense and risk to the\r\n  carrier, contract to carry such freight, with such convenience and\r\n  benefits, for less than general tariff rates to the public?\r\n\r\n  7th. May the defendant, as common carrier, transport over its road\r\n  large quantities of oil, amounting to many full car-loads per day,\r\n  for a less price per car-load than it charges the public generally\r\n  per barrel or for single car-loads or less, provided all persons are\r\n  charged like prices for like quantities?\r\n\r\n  8th. May defendant, as common carrier, make any distinction in\r\n  prices for carrying like freight on the ground of quantity and\r\n  covenants to continue the same if thereby it can make a greater\r\n  profit than to charge the same prices for quantities small and\r\n  great? Is defendant, under all circumstances, obliged to charge the\r\n  same prices per ton or other quantity, for the same distance, to all\r\n  persons tendering freight of the same class, or may it, in good\r\n  faith and without intention to injure other producers or patrons,\r\n  contract to carry for one party at a less price than general rates\r\n  if thereby it can secure a large and profitable business which would\r\n  otherwise be diverted from it, in whole or part?\r\n\r\n  8½. Should decree be rendered for plaintiffs; and, if so, to what\r\n  extent should it be enforced—only within the bounds of the state or\r\n  to all parts of the country within or without the state, to all\r\n  points reached by defendant and connecting lines?\r\n\r\n  9th. Was section 3373 of the Revised Statutes intended to apply to\r\n  cases like the present, and under it is there any authority for the\r\n  injunction relief prayed for in this action?\r\n\r\n  10th. Whether upon such shipments so made by the defendant’s cars by\r\n  the barrel, either in car-load lots or in less amounts, the\r\n  plaintiffs are, either by common law or by the Ohio statutes on the\r\n  subjects, entitled to have their said products carried at the same\r\n  rate of charge between like points of shipment as are allowed to\r\n  said Standard Oil Company or other shippers, either to points on its\r\n  line or branches of said road beyond?\r\n\r\n  11th. Whether the defendant, as a common carrier, may exact from the\r\n  plaintiffs upon such shipments in barrels any amount greater than\r\n  the amount charged to said Standard Oil Company upon shipment of\r\n  like amounts by such tank-cars so long as the plaintiffs offer to\r\n  ship by their own tank-cars on substantially like terms?\r\n\r\n  12th. Whether, if such defendant can be required to give to said\r\n  plaintiffs equal rates of freight upon its shipments with those\r\n  allowed said Standard Oil Company to points upon its line and\r\n  branches, it can be required to give as low a rate to terminal\r\n  points as the rate it receives for its proportion of the service to\r\n  such points, on shipments to points beyond, and on its connecting\r\n  lines on a through rate fixed by it, and such connecting line or\r\n  lines for the through shipment?\r\n\r\n  13th. Whether the fact of the existence of such arrangement, and the\r\n  fact of the said Standard Oil Company being a shipper in amounts\r\n  larger than the plaintiffs, is any justification for the making of\r\n  such charges to the plaintiffs in excess of such charges made to\r\n  said Standard Oil Company? And in order that the same may be legally\r\n  presented to said Supreme Court, the District Court do find the\r\n  facts as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st. The court find the plaintiffs are, and since 1875 have been,\r\n  partners, carrying on, in a large way, at Cleveland, Ohio, where\r\n  this refinery is situated, the business of refining petroleum and\r\n  selling the refined product mainly throughout the territory west and\r\n  northwest of Cleveland, and extending throughout the Western and\r\n  Northwestern states, this business being one in which they have\r\n  invested a large amount of capital, and in which they have\r\n  established a large and profitable trade throughout such territory,\r\n  which constitutes the natural market for the sale of such products\r\n  manufactured at Cleveland, the cost of plaintiffs’ refining being\r\n  about $70,000, with a refining capacity of about 150,000 barrels per\r\n  year.\r\n\r\n  2nd. That the defendant is a consolidated railroad company, owning\r\n  and operating a railroad extending from Buffalo, in the state of New\r\n  York, to Chicago, in the state of Illinois, and passing through\r\n  parts of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,\r\n  Michigan, and Illinois, and also owning and operating branches from\r\n  Toledo, in the state of Ohio, to Detroit, in the state of Michigan,\r\n  and also from White Pigeon, in the state of Michigan, to Grand\r\n  Rapids, in the state of Michigan.\r\n\r\n  3rd. That said railroad, so far as the same is constructed and\r\n  operated in the state of Ohio, extends from the Easterly line of\r\n  Ashtabula County to the Westerly line of Williams County; that it is\r\n  a corporation engaged as common carrier in the business of\r\n  transporting persons and property for hire and reward over its said\r\n  line of road and branches.\r\n\r\n  4th. That it crosses and connects with other lines of railroads at\r\n  Toledo, Coldwater, and Chicago, over which it can and does forward\r\n  passengers and freight to their destination and consignment points\r\n  as requested and directed; that it holds itself out as ready to make\r\n  and does make the rates to points reached by connecting roads; that\r\n  defendant, as such common carrier, has been accustomed to receive\r\n  for transportation property over its line and branches to points\r\n  beyond the termini of the same by delivering the same at such\r\n  termini to connecting roads for carriage to the points of\r\n  consignment.\r\n\r\n  5th. That the rates for such through freights are fixed by agreement\r\n  between the different companies owning the lines over which such\r\n  freights are carried, and not by the defendant alone, and are\r\n  charged by like agreement, from time to time.\r\n\r\n  6th. That what are termed local rates, being for property received\r\n  and delivered at points on the line of defendant’s road, are fixed\r\n  exclusively by the defendant.\r\n\r\n  7th. That some of the towns and cities on the main line and branches\r\n  of the defendant’s road can only be reached by shippers from\r\n  Cleveland over its said road and branches; and all of them, as well\r\n  as the towns on most of its connecting branches, can be most\r\n  directly reached by means of its line from Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  8th. That the defendant is sufficiently supplied with cars and\r\n  engines and appliances for transportation necessary to enable it, in\r\n  the ordinary course of its business, to receive and carry for the\r\n  plaintiffs such products from Cleveland to such markets.\r\n\r\n  9th. That for a period of time extending back beyond the time when\r\n  plaintiffs commenced the manufacture of oil in the City of\r\n  Cleveland, the defendant has published for the benefit of the\r\n  public, tariff rates for local and through freights, which have been\r\n  frequently changed, and including rates for the carriage of oil in\r\n  barrels.\r\n\r\n  10th. The plaintiffs commenced and established their present\r\n  business in Cleveland in the spring or summer of 1875, and\r\n  subsequently, in July, 1876, became engaged in the same by\r\n  arrangement with the Standard Oil Company to the partial extent of\r\n  their own manufacturing establishment.\r\n\r\n  10½. That during the time in the petition named the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, the plaintiffs’ principal competitor in business, has also\r\n  been and still is engaged in a like business with them, it having at\r\n  Cleveland a large refinery from which it sells like products in same\r\n  markets; that the refineries of both are situate on the line of\r\n  railroads other than that of the defendant, but having like\r\n  connection with it; that each has switch tracks extending to their\r\n  refineries from the main lines of its roads on which they are\r\n  situate, by means of which shipments from them are made, the course\r\n  of business in making shipments by defendant’s road by the car-load\r\n  (which is the manner in which nearly all the business is done) being\r\n  for the defendant, on request of either, to furnish its cars, which\r\n  are switched from its connecting track by the road on which the\r\n  refineries are situate to the refineries, then loaded by the\r\n  shippers, and by said road drawn out and placed on the defendant’s\r\n  tracks for shipment by its road. By some traffic arrangement between\r\n  the roads a switching charge per car for such service is charged by\r\n  the local road against the defendant, which is by it at its\r\n  discretion charged against the shippers with its general freight\r\n  charge. Upon shipments in less than car-load lots delivery is made\r\n  to the defendant’s freight depot.\r\n\r\n  11th. That the Standard Oil Company was then, and ever since has\r\n  been, engaged in the same business at Cleveland and elsewhere, and\r\n  did then and ever since has manufactured and shipped more than\r\n  ninety one-hundredths of all the illuminating oil and products of\r\n  petroleum manufactured and shipped at and from the City of\r\n  Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  12th. The court further find that prior to 1875 it was a question\r\n  whether the Standard Oil Company would remain in Cleveland or remove\r\n  its works to the oil-producing country, and such question depended\r\n  mainly upon rates of transportation from Cleveland to market; that\r\n  prior thereto said Standard Company did ship large quantities of its\r\n  products by water to Chicago and other lake points, and from thence\r\n  distributed the same by rail to inland markets; that it then\r\n  represented to defendant the probability of such removal; that water\r\n  transportation was very low during the season of navigation; that\r\n  unless some arrangement was made for rates at which it could ship\r\n  the year round as an inducement, it would ship by water and store\r\n  for winter distribution; that it owned its tank-cars and had\r\n  tank-stations and switches or would have at Chicago, Toledo,\r\n  Detroit, and Grand Rapids, on and into which the cars and oil in\r\n  bulk could be delivered and unloaded without expense and annoyance\r\n  to defendant; that it had switches at Cleveland leading to its works\r\n  at which to load cars, and would load and unload all cars; that the\r\n  quantity of oil to be shipped by the company was very large, and\r\n  amounted to 90 per cent. or more of all the oil manufactured or\r\n  shipped from Cleveland, and that if satisfactory rates could be\r\n  agreed upon it would ship over defendant’s road all its oil products\r\n  for territory and markets west and northwest of Cleveland, and agree\r\n  that the quantity for each year should be equal to the amount\r\n  shipped the preceding year; that upon the faith of these\r\n  representations the defendant did enter into the contract and\r\n  arrangement substantially as set forth in defendant’s answer; that\r\n  the rates were not fixed rates, but depended upon the general card\r\n  tariff rates as charged from time to time, but substantially to be\r\n  carried from time to time for about ten cents per barrel less than\r\n  tariff rates, and, in consideration of such reduced rates as to bulk\r\n  oil, the Standard Company agreed to furnish its own cars and tanks,\r\n  load them on switches at distributing points, and unload them into\r\n  distributing tanks, and was also to load and unload oil shipped in\r\n  barrels, and without expense to defendant, and with, by reason\r\n  thereof, less risk to defendant, which entered into the\r\n  consideration, and was also to ship all its freight to points west\r\n  and northwest of Cleveland, except small quantities, to lake ports\r\n  not reached by rail, and to so manage the shipments, as to cars and\r\n  times, as would be most favourable to defendant; that defendant then\r\n  agreed to said terms; that said agreement so made in 1875 has\r\n  remained in force ever since.\r\n\r\n  13th. That at a cost exceeding $100,000 said Standard Company had\r\n  and constructed the terminal facilities promised and herein found;\r\n  that, in fact, the risk of danger from fire to defendant, the\r\n  expense of handling, in loading and unloading, and in the use of the\r\n  standard tank-cars is less (but how much the testimony does not\r\n  show) than upon oil shipped without the use of such or similar\r\n  terminal facilities; that said Standard Company commenced by\r\n  shipping about 450,000 barrels a year over defendant’s road, which\r\n  increased from year to year until, in 1882, the year before the\r\n  filing the petition in this action, the quantity so shipped on\r\n  defendant’s road amounted to 742,000 barrels, equal to 2,000 barrels\r\n  or one full train-load per day.\r\n\r\n  14th. That said arrangement was not exclusive, but was at all times\r\n  open to others shipping a like quantity and furnishing like service\r\n  and facilities; that it was not made or continued with any intention\r\n  on the part of the defendant to injure the plaintiffs in any manner;\r\n  that plaintiffs knew of an arrangement between defendant and\r\n  Standard Oil Company years before January 1, 1880, and on or about\r\n  July 20, 1876, contracted with the Standard Company to give it the\r\n  control of the shipments of plaintiffs’ oil and the plaintiffs the\r\n  benefit, if any, of any arrangements then existing or that might\r\n  thereafter exist with the Standard Oil Company upon shipment of oil,\r\n  and which plaintiffs received until about January 1, 1880, when they\r\n  ceased operating with the Standard Oil Company, and thereafter were\r\n  charged and paid the regular tariff rates published by defendant and\r\n  by it charged and collected from all the public except the Standard\r\n  Oil Company under the arrangement aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  15th. That the testimony on behalf of the plaintiffs fails to show\r\n  the quantity manufactured or shipped by them, and how much they\r\n  could or would ship by defendant’s road if the Standard Company were\r\n  charged tariff rates, does not appear in the testimony, although the\r\n  testimony does show that plaintiffs shipped many car-loads, but the\r\n  court find that the Standard Company have shipped and do ship over\r\n  defendant’s road more than 90/100 of all the oil manufactured at and\r\n  shipped from Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  16th. The court further find that at the time of filing the\r\n  petition, and at all times after November 29, 1882, the prices\r\n  charged the Standard Company from Cleveland to Chicago was fifty\r\n  cents per barrel on oil in barrels, and forty dollars for each\r\n  tank-car; that at the time of filing the petition, and from and\r\n  after May 19, 1883, the tariff rate between the points aforesaid was\r\n  sixty cents per barrel, while from November 20, 1882, to May 19,\r\n  1883, the tariff was seventy cents per barrel; that prior to the\r\n  dates aforesaid the tariff rates and rates to the Standard\r\n  frequently changed, and the difference was frequently greater than\r\n  after said dates; that sixty-one barrels constitute a car-load and\r\n  eighty barrels are estimated to the tank, but that some tanks hold\r\n  one hundred and some one hundred and twenty barrels, and that at no\r\n  time were tariff rates made or published for tank-cars carried by\r\n  defendant with refined oil except when furnished by said Standard\r\n  Company.\r\n\r\n  17th. That after said May 19th, 1883, about the same difference of\r\n  ten cents per barrel existed between tariff rates and the prices\r\n  charged to the Standard Oil Company to the different points along\r\n  the line and consignment points beyond the termini of defendant’s\r\n  road; that five barrels of oil make a ton, and that the prices\r\n  charged the Standard after November, 1882, from Cleveland to\r\n  Chicago, amounted to 70/100 of one cent per ton, per mile, and\r\n  tariff rates to 83/100 of one cent per ton per mile; that the\r\n  contract of arrangement made with defendant has been largely\r\n  profitable to defendant; that during the season of water navigation\r\n  the Standard Company could have shipped to said distributing points\r\n  on vessels by the lakes and river barreled oil for a less sum than\r\n  the rates charged to it by defendant—to plaintiffs and the public\r\n  were reasonable rates in themselves.\r\n\r\n  18th. That the defendant from time to time published and still does\r\n  publish and hold forth to the public a certain printed tariff of\r\n  rates of charge for the shipment and delivery of all classes of\r\n  freight, including the products of the plaintiffs’ refinery, between\r\n  Cleveland aforesaid and the various towns and cities upon its said\r\n  line, branches, and connecting lines, and has refused and still does\r\n  refuse to ship such products for the plaintiffs to any of such\r\n  points named in its tariff or schedule except for the prices therein\r\n  named; and that such schedule fixes the prices for oil shipment at\r\n  so much per barrel to the public, irrespective of their being\r\n  shipped in barrels by ordinary freight cars or in bulk by means of\r\n  tank-cars.\r\n\r\n  19th. That the plaintiffs have since December, 1879, frequently\r\n  applied to the defendant both for reduced rates upon such tariff\r\n  rates and for like rates with those made to such Standard Oil\r\n  Company, both upon their general shipments by the ordinary freight\r\n  cars of the defendant and also upon shipments to be by them made in\r\n  bulk by means of tank-cars owned by them, they proposing to load and\r\n  unload the same at terminal points, and to assume all risks by fire\r\n  or leakage; but that the defendant has and still does refuse to\r\n  allow them by either course of shipment rates less than such tariff\r\n  rates, the tariff charged and demanded upon such shipments in bulk\r\n  being on the basis of eighty barrels allowed to be shipped by each\r\n  tank-car.\r\n\r\n  20th. The defendant has received ever since the first day of\r\n  December, 1879, and still does receive from said Standard Oil\r\n  Company at Cleveland and ship for _him_, like products to those of\r\n  the plaintiffs at rates much less than such schedule rates, and\r\n  receives and ships for said Standard Oil Company oil for shipment in\r\n  bulk to such points by means of tank-cars of said Standard Company\r\n  at rates much less than said schedule rates and much less than the\r\n  rates allowed to said company for the shipment of oil by barrels in\r\n  ordinary freight cars, and that such reduced rates to said Standard\r\n  Oil Company by means of such tank-cars are allowed both by the\r\n  making to it a lower rate upon its shipments by the defendant’s cars\r\n  in barrels, and also by means of its being allowed to ship by means\r\n  of its said tank-cars to their full capacity, running from 80 to 120\r\n  barrels each, and averaging over 100 barrels each, and the reduced\r\n  rate being charged on a basis of 80 barrels per car. The defendant\r\n  charged the plaintiffs the switching charge, and omitted to charge\r\n  the same to the Standard Oil Company; that it was a further part of\r\n  such understanding, that should the defendant give to other shippers\r\n  like rates, said Standard Oil Company would as far as possible\r\n  withdraw from it its shipments; and that for the purpose of\r\n  effectually securing at least the greater part of said trade, the\r\n  defendant, on the completion of the New York, Cleveland and St.\r\n  Louis Railway, a competing line from Cleveland to the West, in the\r\n  year 1883 entered into a traffic arrangement with it, giving to it a\r\n  portion of the shipments of said Standard Oil Company west, on a\r\n  condition of its uniting with it in the carrying out of such\r\n  understanding as to reduced rates to said Standard Company, which\r\n  arrangements still exist.\r\n\r\n  21st. That upon the shipment made by the defendant for said Standard\r\n  Oil Company of such products the rates paid for shipment to points\r\n  of delivery upon the defendant’s connecting lines and beyond its\r\n  line have been and are less for the rateable amount of carriage\r\n  charged for the distance transported over its own line, than said\r\n  schedule rates or than the lower rates charged to said Standard Oil\r\n  Company for shipments to the terminal points at which said shipments\r\n  went from said road to its connecting line; how much less the\r\n  defendant has refused to state.\r\n\r\n  22nd. That the reduced rates charged to said Standard Oil Company\r\n  upon its shipments are arrived at by charging upon such shipments\r\n  full tariff rates, and afterward, in accordance with some\r\n  prearranged method agreed on with said Standard Oil Company,\r\n  refunding to it a portion of the freight so charged and collected,\r\n  the amount refunded being known as a “drawback” or “rebate.”\r\n\r\n  23rd. That the evidence does not establish the fact whether or not\r\n  all the various advantages claimed as secured to defendant by its\r\n  contract with the Standard Oil Company are the equivalent for the\r\n  discrimination made to it in freights.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 46 (See page 2080)\r\nLETTER OF EDWARD S. RAPALLO TO GENERAL PHINEAS PEASE, RECEIVER CLEVELAND\r\n                     AND MARIETTA RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3,112, pages 576–577.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            32 NASSAU STREET, NEW YORK, March 2, 1885.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL PHINEAS PEASE,\r\n      Receiver Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_: My opinion is asked as to the legality of your making\r\n  such an arrangement with the Standard Oil Company as set forth\r\n  below.\r\n\r\n  The facts, as I understand them, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Standard Oil Company proposes to ship or control the shipping of\r\n  a large amount of oil over your road, say a quantity sufficient to\r\n  yield to you $3,000 freight per month. That company also owns the\r\n  pipes through which oil is conveyed from the wells owned by\r\n  individuals to your railroad, except those pipes leading from the\r\n  wells of George Rice, which pipes are his own. The company has, or\r\n  can acquire, facilities for storing all its oil until such time as\r\n  it can lay pipes to Marietta, and thus deprive your company of the\r\n  carriage of all its oil.\r\n\r\n  The amount of oil shipped by Mr. Rice is comparatively small, say a\r\n  quantity sufficient to yield $300 per month for freight.\r\n\r\n  The Standard Oil Company threatens to store, and afterward pipe all\r\n  oil under its control unless you make the following arrangements,\r\n  viz.: You shall make a uniform rate of thirty-five cents per barrel\r\n  for all persons excepting the Standard Oil Company; you shall charge\r\n  them ten cents per barrel for oil and also pay them twenty-five\r\n  cents per barrel out of the thirty-five cents collected from other\r\n  shippers.\r\n\r\n  It may render the subject less difficult of consideration to\r\n  determine, first, those acts which you cannot with propriety do as\r\n  receiver.\r\n\r\n  You are by the decree vested with all the powers of receiver,\r\n  according to the rules and practice of the court; are directed to\r\n  continue the operations of the railroad and can safely make\r\n  disbursements from such moneys as come into your hands for such\r\n  purposes only as the decree directs, viz.: wages, interest, taxes,\r\n  rents, freights, mileage on rolling stock, traffic balances and\r\n  certain debts for supplies.\r\n\r\n  In my opinion this would not protect you in collecting freight from\r\n  one shipper and paying it over to another.\r\n\r\n  All moneys received, therefore, from any person for freight over\r\n  your road, must pass into your hands and there remain to be\r\n  disbursed by proper authority. After an examination of your statute,\r\n  however, I find no prohibition against your allowing a discount, or\r\n  charging a rate less than a schedule rate to a shipper on account of\r\n  the large amount shipped by him.\r\n\r\n  As you are acting, therefore, in the interest of the company, and\r\n  endeavouring to increase its legitimate earnings as much as\r\n  possible, I find nothing in the statutes to prevent your making a\r\n  discrimination, especially where the circumstances are such that a\r\n  large shipper declines to give your road his freight unless you\r\n  allow him to ship at less than the schedule rates. Therefore, there\r\n  is no legal objection to the making of an arrangement which in\r\n  practical effect may be the same as that proposed, provided the\r\n  objections pointed out above are obviated.\r\n\r\n  You may with propriety allow the Standard Oil Company to charge\r\n  twenty-five cents per barrel for all oil transported through their\r\n  pipes to your road, and I understand from Mr. Terry that it is\r\n  practicable to so arrange the details that the company can, in\r\n  effect, collect this direct, without its passing through your hands.\r\n  You may agree to carry all such oil of the Standard Oil Company or\r\n  of others delivered to your road through their pipes, at ten cents\r\n  per barrel. You may also charge all other shippers thirty-five cents\r\n  per barrel freight, even though they delivered oil to your road\r\n  through their own pipes, and this I gather from your letter and from\r\n  Mr. Terry would include Mr. Rice.\r\n\r\n  You are at liberty, also, to arrange for the payment of a freight by\r\n  the Standard Oil Company calculated upon the following basis, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Such company to be charged an amount equal to ten cents per barrel,\r\n  less an amount equivalent to twenty-five cents per barrel upon all\r\n  oil shipped by Rice, the agreement between you and the company thus\r\n  being that the charge to be paid by them is a certain sum\r\n  ascertained by such a calculation. If it is impracticable so to\r\n  arrange the business that the Standard Oil Company shall, in effect,\r\n  collect the twenty-five cents per barrel from those persons using\r\n  the company’s pipes from the wells to the railroad without its\r\n  passing into your hands, you may properly also deduct from the price\r\n  to be paid by this company an amount equal to twenty-five cents per\r\n  barrel upon the oil shipped by such persons provided your accounts,\r\n  bills, vouchers, etc., are consistent with the real arrangement\r\n  actually made, you will incur no personal responsibility by carrying\r\n  out such an arrangement as I suggest. It is possible that by a\r\n  proper application to the court, some person may prevent you in the\r\n  future from permitting any discrimination. Even if Mr. Rice should\r\n  compel you, subsequently, to refund to him the excess charged over\r\n  the Standard Oil Company, the result would not be a loss to your\r\n  road, taking into consideration the receipts from the Standard Oil\r\n  Company, if I understand correctly the figures. There is no theory,\r\n  however, in my opinion under the decisions of the courts, relating\r\n  to this subject, upon which, for the purpose, an action could be\r\n  successfully maintained in this instance.\r\n\r\n                            Yours truly,\r\n                                                    EDWARD S. RAPALLO.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 47 (See page 2084)\r\n TESTIMONY OF F. G. CARREL, FREIGHT AGENT OF THE CLEVELAND AND MARIETTA\r\n                            RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the case of Parker Handy and John Paton, Trustees, _vs._ The\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company _et al._, Circuit Court of\r\n  the United States, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The auditor reports it (the $340) remitted on October 29, 1885.\r\n  Please state by whom it was held from the first of May to that time.\r\n\r\n  _A._ We might as well go back of that, and I will make a clean\r\n  sweep, so far as I am concerned. This overcharge of twenty-five\r\n  cents was held by the Macksburg Pipe Line Company. Whether this was\r\n  my fault or the fault of the general agent I am not able to say. I\r\n  know no difference between Mr. Rice’s oil and the Pipe Line\r\n  Company’s.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ The books of the company show from the 26th of March, 1885,\r\n  until April 28, 1885, Mr. Rice shipped from Macksburg to Marietta\r\n  1,360 barrels; that upon these shipments $340, or twenty-five cents\r\n  per barrel, were reported to the auditor of the Cleveland and\r\n  Marietta Railway upon the 29th of October. Who sent the\r\n  money—$340—to the railroad company, and who reported the amount of\r\n  money to the auditor?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If I understand correctly, if it is the amount I think it is,\r\n  that is the amount for overcharge. It came through my office.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ In whose hands had the $340 been from the time paid by Mr. Rice\r\n  until it was sent by you to the bank at Cambridge?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I received check from Pipe Line.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How soon did you send money to Cambridge after receiving check?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think the next day.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ How did you come to get that check?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I don’t understand.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did you go after it?\r\n\r\n  _A._ No, sir; it was sent to me by mail.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Where was it mailed?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Oil City, I think.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ By whom was the check signed?\r\n\r\n  _A._ By the treasurer, J. R. Campbell, I think.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If I understand the arrangement during the month of April,\r\n  1885, you collected thirty-five cents per barrel for all oil shipped\r\n  by George Rice, and paid ten cents to the receiver of the railroad\r\n  company and twenty-five cents to the Macksburg Pipe Line?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir; as long as Mr. Rice shipped.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Afterwards the Macksburg Pipe Line Company sent the money thus\r\n  paid to it to you, and you paid the money into the depository of the\r\n  railroad company on the 29th of October, 1885?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 48 (See page 2084)\r\nREPORT OF THE SPECIAL MASTER COMMISSIONER GEORGE K. NASH TO THE CIRCUIT\r\n                                 COURT\r\n\r\n\r\n  [In the case of Parker Handy and John Paton, Trustees, _vs._ The\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company _et al._, Circuit Court of\r\n  the United States, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE HONOURED THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n          Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division.\r\n\r\n  By an order of your court made on the 18th day of December, 1885, in\r\n  the case of Parker Handy and John Paton, Trustees, _vs._ The\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company _et al._, I was appointed a\r\n  special master commissioner to investigate and report to the court\r\n  for its action what discriminations have been made in freights by\r\n  Receiver Pease, or during his administration by those under him, and\r\n  to this end I was authorised to summon and examine witnesses and to\r\n  cause their testimony to be reduced to writing so far as in my\r\n  discretion it might be necessary. I was also required to inquire\r\n  fully and particularly into the facts and report to the court what\r\n  discriminations had been made, under what arrangements and to what\r\n  extent, and to report fully all the facts and show to what extent\r\n  and under what circumstances discriminations have been made against\r\n  shippers as well as in favour of shippers, and by whom such\r\n  discriminations were authorised and by whom made. In compliance with\r\n  this order I proceeded to examine the matters therein referred to,\r\n  and in the course of such examination called the following-named\r\n  persons as witnesses:\r\n\r\n  T. D. Dale, C. C. Pickering (auditor of the Cleveland and Marietta\r\n  Railroad Company under Receiver Pease), F. G. Carrel, J. E. Terry,\r\n  Daniel O’Day, George Rice, H. L. Wilgus, W. H. Slack, W. J. Cramm,\r\n  George Best, Jr., and J. C. McCarty, whose evidence I caused to be\r\n  reduced to writing by A. C. Armstrong, a stenographer, and is\r\n  herewith submitted.\r\n\r\n  I find from the evidence that soon after General Pease was appointed\r\n  receiver of the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad, an arrangement was\r\n  entered into with Daniel O’Day and W. T. Scheide, by which it was\r\n  agreed that the rate to be charged by Receiver Pease and his\r\n  subordinates upon all crude oil shipped from Macksburg and vicinity\r\n  upon the line of the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company to\r\n  Marietta should be thirty-five cents per barrel; that the agent of\r\n  the receiver at Marietta should also pay the agent of the parties\r\n  represented by O’Day and Scheide; that his compensation was to be\r\n  $85 per month, $60 of which was to be paid by Receiver Pease and $25\r\n  by the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide; that it was the\r\n  duty of this joint agent (one F. G. Carrel) to collect from all\r\n  shippers the sum of thirty-five cents per barrel, and to account to\r\n  Receiver Pease for ten cents of this sum, and to the parties\r\n  represented by O’Day and Scheide for the balance. This arrangement\r\n  went into force on the 20th day of March, 1885, and continued in\r\n  force until September, 1885, at which time one George Rice made\r\n  complaint to your court that discriminations were being made by the\r\n  receiver against oil shippers.\r\n\r\n  Negotiations for this arrangement were opened in the City of Toledo\r\n  on the 8th day of February, 1885, at a meeting which was attended by\r\n  Daniel O’Day, W. T. Scheide, A. G. Blair (acting general freight and\r\n  passenger agent of the receiver of the Wheeling and Lake Erie\r\n  Railroad Company), and J. E. Terry (general freight and passenger\r\n  agent of Pease, the receiver of the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad\r\n  Company). The agreement above referred to was substantially reached\r\n  at this meeting. Mr. Terry reported the same to General Pease,\r\n  receiver of the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad Company, who\r\n  thereupon wrote a letter to his general counsel in New York, asking\r\n  advice in regard thereto, which letter was transmitted to said\r\n  counsel by J. E. Terry in person. E. S. Rapallo, an attorney in New\r\n  York City, replied to the letter of General Pease, and a copy of his\r\n  letter is now on file in your court and is a part of a report filed\r\n  by General Pease in November, 1885. This arrangement seems to have\r\n  been entered into with full knowledge of General Pease, the\r\n  receiver, and after consultation with his counsel, and with the full\r\n  knowledge of his general freight and passenger agent, J. E. Terry.\r\n\r\n  George Rice was the owner of certain oil wells in the Macksburg Oil\r\n  Region and he also purchased some oil from the owners of certain\r\n  other wells in the same district. The oil which he produced and also\r\n  the oil which he purchased he was in the habit of transporting to\r\n  his refinery at Marietta, Ohio, by means of the Cleveland and\r\n  Marietta Railroad. Before the arrangements to which I have referred\r\n  went into effect he had been charged upon the shipment made by him\r\n  the sum of seventeen and one-half cents per barrel. After the 20th\r\n  of March, 1885, he was charged thirty-five cents per barrel upon all\r\n  oil shipped by him. Between the 20th of March and the 30th of April\r\n  following, Mr. Rice shipped from Macksburg to Marietta over the\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad, 1,360 barrels of oil. Upon this oil\r\n  he was charged thirty-five cents per barrel, or the sum of $476.\r\n  This money was collected by F. G. Carrel, the agent of the receiver\r\n  and also the agent of the parties represented at Toledo by O’Day and\r\n  Scheide. This money was divided according to the agreement, and $136\r\n  was sent by Carrel to the bank of the receiver at Cambridge, Ohio,\r\n  and the remaining $340, or twenty-five cents for each barrel of oil\r\n  shipped by Rice, was sent by Carrel to the oil parties who had their\r\n  headquarters at Oil City, Pennsylvania. On or about the 29th of\r\n  October, 1885, this $340 was returned to Mr. Carrel at Marietta, by\r\n  a check from Oil City, which check was signed by one J. R. Campbell,\r\n  treasurer. This money was sent by Carrel to the bank in Cambridge in\r\n  which the receiver made his deposits. It will be observed that this\r\n  money was returned from Oil City some ten or twelve days after Judge\r\n  Baxter made his order directing the receiver to make a report\r\n  showing what discriminations, if any, had been made by him in the\r\n  shipments of oil, which order had been obtained upon the complaint\r\n  of George Rice. It was also returned after a consultation had by J.\r\n  E. Terry with Daniel O’Day in the City of Cleveland. Mr. Terry\r\n  states that the receiver was made acquainted with the steps taken by\r\n  him in connection with this transaction. The receiver did not submit\r\n  himself to an examination in regard to this matter, but filed an\r\n  affidavit with me which I attach to this report, in which he states\r\n  in substance that he did not know at the time he filed his reports\r\n  with your court that that part of the agreement between himself and\r\n  the oil parties which required that twenty-five cents per barrel of\r\n  the moneys collected by him should be paid to the oil parties had\r\n  been carried out, or that the money thus paid by Rice, and by Carrel\r\n  paid over to the oil parties, had been returned. The reason given by\r\n  Receiver Pease and by Mr. Terry for entering into this agreement was\r\n  that the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide were threatening\r\n  to put down a pipe-line from Macksburg to Parkersburg, through which\r\n  to transport the oil produced by them in this region to the latter\r\n  city, and that if this threat was carried out, the Railroad Company\r\n  would be prevented from carrying oil produced by them to Marietta.\r\n  They further stated that in consideration of the arrangement to\r\n  which I have referred, the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide\r\n  agreed not to put down a pipe-line, but to ship their oil over the\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad.\r\n\r\n  As soon as George Rice found that the rates on oil had been raised\r\n  from seventeen and one-half to thirty-five cents per barrel, and\r\n  that he could not get any better terms for his shipment from the\r\n  railroad, he commenced to lay a pipe-line from his wells in the\r\n  Macksburg field to Lowell, on the Muskingum River. This line was\r\n  completed about the first of May, 1885, and from that time he\r\n  transported all his oil through this pipe to Lowell, and thence\r\n  shipped it to Marietta by boat on the Muskingum River. As soon as\r\n  the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide ascertained that Rice\r\n  was putting down a pipe-line, they proceeded also to lay a pipe-line\r\n  from the Macksburg oil field to Parkersburg, in West Virginia. Since\r\n  the completion of their pipe-line all the oil sent to Parkersburg\r\n  and Marietta has been sent through this pipe-line. For several\r\n  months they continued to ship some of their oil North over the\r\n  Cleveland and Marietta Railroad to Cleveland, but during the last\r\n  two months these shipments have ceased, and all the oils now\r\n  produced by the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide are sent by\r\n  them through their pipe-line to Parkersburg.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rice, since the completion of his pipe-line, has shipped through\r\n  it to Marietta more than forty-five thousand barrels of oil. The\r\n  shipments by Mr. Rice might have been retained for the benefit of\r\n  the railroad had the rate of seventeen and one-half cents per barrel\r\n  been continued. It is probable that had not the arrangement which we\r\n  have been considering been entered into, a line would have been put\r\n  down by the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide, but without\r\n  the arrangement the patronage of Mr. Rice could have been retained.\r\n  The result of the arrangement seems to be that the railroad has lost\r\n  the patronage not only of the parties represented by O’Day and\r\n  Scheide, but also of Mr. Rice, and it is not to-day carrying a\r\n  barrel of oil.\r\n\r\n  The Argand Oil Works and the Argand Refining Company, two\r\n  corporations located at Marietta, Ohio, have made complaint that\r\n  from the eighteenth day of February until the fourteenth day of\r\n  October, 1885, they were shippers of oil from the Macksburg Oil\r\n  Region, over the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad, and that they were\r\n  discriminated against by the receiver and his agents. I conceived\r\n  that the order of your court referring this subject to me was broad\r\n  enough to cover the complaint made by these corporations and I\r\n  accordingly called W. H. Slack, W. J. Cramm, C. C. Pickering, and F.\r\n  G. Carrel as witnesses in regard to this complaint, and their\r\n  testimony is herewith submitted, together with the account presented\r\n  by these two corporations and the receipted bills taken by them in\r\n  payment of freight. From the evidence of these witnesses it appears\r\n  that these corporations, during the time covered by the complaint,\r\n  were engaged in refining oil at Marietta, Ohio. They purchased their\r\n  crude oil of the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide at\r\n  Macksburg. Their purchases were made by ordering their oil when\r\n  needed by telegraph from a man by the name of Seep, located at Oil\r\n  City, Pennsylvania, and they were charged therefor the market price\r\n  of oil at Oil City on the day when the telegraphic order was given.\r\n  The oil was then shipped to them over the Cleveland and Marietta\r\n  Railroad and a bill for freight presented to them in the form\r\n  following: “The Argand Oil Works, Marietta, Ohio, To the Cleveland\r\n  and Marietta Railroad Company, Dr.”\r\n\r\n  In these bills they were charged for all oil shipped at the rate of\r\n  thirty-five cents per barrel. This amount was paid by them to\r\n  Carrel, the agent of the receiver, at Marietta, Ohio. Of this amount\r\n  Carrel paid to the receiver ten cents, and to the parties\r\n  represented by O’Day and Scheide, twenty-five cents. I am of the\r\n  opinion that these parties were in the same position as George Rice,\r\n  with the exception that Mr. Rice produced his oil from the ground\r\n  and shipped it over the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad, and these\r\n  parties bought their oil instead of producing it from the ground. I\r\n  cannot see as this difference modifies in any way the discrimination\r\n  made against them. They claim that from February 18, 1885, until\r\n  October 14, 1885, they shipped 3,679–6/10 barrels of oil, for which\r\n  they were charged $1,232.06 as freight, and that the discriminations\r\n  against them amounted to $888.70. From their bill certain reduction\r\n  should be made. All shipments made prior to March 20, 1885, should\r\n  be excluded for the reason that the discriminating arrangement\r\n  entered into between the receiver and the parties represented by\r\n  O’Day and Scheide did not go into effect until the 20th of March,\r\n  1885. Two shipments, one made on the 7th of August, and the other\r\n  made on the 21st of September, from Dexter City, should also be\r\n  excluded for the reason that all oils shipped from Dexter City were\r\n  charged for at the same rates as these complainants were taxed.\r\n  After making these deductions, I find that under the contract\r\n  complained of, the Argand Oil Works and the Argand Refining Company\r\n  shipped from the 20th of March until the 14th of October, 2,695\r\n  barrels of oil; that they were required to pay upon these shipments\r\n  the sum of $894.59, and that of this sum Carrel, the agent of the\r\n  receiver at Marietta, paid to the receiver the sum of $245.44, and\r\n  to the parties in Pennsylvania represented by O’Day and Scheide the\r\n  sum of $649.15.\r\n\r\n  A complaint of a similar character is made by the Marietta Oil\r\n  Works, a partnership engaged in the business of refining oils at\r\n  Marietta, Ohio. Upon their complaint, I examined George C. Best,\r\n  Jr., J. C. McCarty, W. H. Slack, C. C. Pickering, and F. G. Carrel\r\n  as witnesses, and their evidence is submitted herewith in full,\r\n  together with the account presented by this partnership and the\r\n  receipted bills presented by the Cleveland and Marietta Railroad and\r\n  paid by them. Their case in all respects seems to be precisely like\r\n  that of the Argand Oil Works and the Argand Refining Company. They\r\n  claim that from the 1st day of April until the 31st day of August,\r\n  1885, inclusive, they shipped 2,717 barrels of oil, for which they\r\n  were charged as freight $950.95, and that they were discriminated\r\n  against to the extent of $679.25. From their bill I think that there\r\n  should be excluded two shipments from Dexter City, one made on the\r\n  12th day of June, and the other on the 18th day of June, for the\r\n  reason that no discriminations were made in freights, by the\r\n  receiver, of oils shipped from Dexter City. After taking into\r\n  account these two shipments, I find that the Marietta Oil Works\r\n  shipped from Macksburg and Elba on their account 2,547 barrels of\r\n  oil; that the freights paid by them upon these shipments amounted to\r\n  the sum of $891.45, and that out of this sum Carrel, the agent at\r\n  Marietta, paid to the receiver the sum of $251.70, and to the\r\n  parties represented by O’Day and Scheide the sum of $639.75.\r\n\r\n  I find that during the receivership of General Pease, no oils were\r\n  shipped from Macksburg North over the Cleveland and Marietta\r\n  Railroad except such as were shipped by the parties represented by\r\n  Messrs. O’Day and Scheide.\r\n\r\n  I have purposely referred to the parties who entered into this\r\n  arrangement with Receiver Pease and his freight agent, J. E. Terry,\r\n  as “the parties represented by O’Day and Scheide,” for the reason\r\n  that I have not been able to ascertain who or what the parties are.\r\n  It appears from the evidence that during the time that M. D.\r\n  Woodford had control as manager of the Cleveland and Marietta\r\n  Railroad, one W. J. Brundred and T. D. Dale conceived the idea of\r\n  running pipes to all the wells in the Macksburg Oil Regions, and\r\n  then by concentrating them together convey all the oils thus\r\n  gathered through the main line to the Cleveland and Marietta\r\n  Railroad and deposit it in tanks, and with this end in view entered\r\n  into a contract in writing with said Woodford, a copy of which\r\n  contract is attached to the report of Receiver Pease, filed in your\r\n  court in November, 1885. After this contract was entered into, they\r\n  organised a corporation known as the Ohio Transit Company, with T.\r\n  D. Dale as president and W. J. Brundred as vice-president, to which\r\n  corporation this contract was assigned. This company continued in\r\n  the business until January, 1885. Mr. Dale, the president, states\r\n  that “We said we could not compete with the Standard Oil Company,\r\n  and for that reason we sold out at a fair price.” When asked to whom\r\n  his company sold their property, Mr. Dale answered, “I don’t know\r\n  what company, but my recollection is that it might have been the\r\n  National Transit Company.” “It was done in their office. I don’t\r\n  know whether the bill of sale was made to Mr. O’Day or to Mr.\r\n  Scheide.” Mr. Dale further states that “Mr. O’Day was vice-president\r\n  of the National Transit Company, and that Mr. Scheide was its\r\n  general manager; it, however, is conjecture on my part.” In another\r\n  place Mr. Dale states that the gentleman managing the National\r\n  Transit Company bought the property of the Ohio Transit Company, and\r\n  gives as their names Daniel O’Day, W. T. Scheide, and J. R.\r\n  Campbell. The corporation or partnership, or whatever it is which\r\n  now manages the pipe-line system in Macksburg oil fields, and\r\n  extending from there to Parkersburg, is known as the Macksburg Pipe\r\n  Line. One Daniel O’Day, now having his headquarters at Macksburg, is\r\n  the manager of this pipe-line. When O’Day was asked, “To whom does\r\n  the Macksburg Pipe Line belong?” he answered, “I do not believe I\r\n  can answer that; I do not know.” When asked, “Who has general\r\n  control of it?” he answered, “Mr. Scheide, Mr. O’Day, and J. R.\r\n  Campbell.” He stated that “Mr. Scheide lives in Titusville, Mr.\r\n  Campbell at Oil City, and Mr. O’Day at Buffalo.” He also stated that\r\n  these gentlemen were officers of the National Transit Company and\r\n  the United Pipe Line, a division of the National Transit Company;\r\n  that Mr. O’Day is general manager of the National Transit Company,\r\n  and when asked whether the Macksburg Pipe Line is also a branch of\r\n  the same system, he answered, “Really, I am not well enough posted\r\n  to know, but I presume it is.” Daniel O’Day also stated that the\r\n  National Transit Company is a corporation organised under the laws\r\n  of New York, and that its principal office is located in New York\r\n  City. He also stated that “its property is located throughout the\r\n  state of New York and the state of Pennsylvania, and some in Ohio.”\r\n  The line located in Ohio he described as running from Parker’s\r\n  Landing, in Pennsylvania, to Cleveland. He also stated that the\r\n  United Pipe Line is a division of the National Transit Company which\r\n  runs from wells to railroad points or pumping stations, and that the\r\n  wells to which he referred are located in Alleghany County, New\r\n  York, and throughout a large portion of Pennsylvania. He also stated\r\n  that the Macksburg Pipe Line controls, by lease and deed, sixty or\r\n  seventy acres of land in this state of the line of the Cleveland and\r\n  Marietta Railroad Company, and that the lease and deeds for this\r\n  land are in the name of one Benjamin Brewster, of New York City, and\r\n  that said Brewster is the vice-president of the National Transit\r\n  Company. When Mr. O’Day was asked, “What relation does the National\r\n  Transit Company and the United Pipe Line Company sustain to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company?” he answered, “I believe that people having\r\n  stock in the National Transit Company or the United Pipe Line can\r\n  hold stock, and do hold stock, in the Standard Oil Company, but I do\r\n  not know what further relations they have.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I have attempted to summarise in a very brief manner the evidence\r\n  which has been taken by me under the order of your court, but in\r\n  order to obtain a full understanding of the situation, it will\r\n  perhaps be necessary to read all the evidence which is herewith\r\n  submitted in full, in connection with the reports and exhibits filed\r\n  by General Pease, in November, 1885.\r\n\r\n      Respectfully submitted,\r\n                              (Signed)      GEORGE K.

A well producing one barrel a day at the present time is\r\n  valued at $500; one year ago it was worth $750.\r\n\r\n  The valuation of the stock of the Standard Oil Company at the\r\n  present time is $150,000,000, or nearly five times as great as the\r\n  entire Oil Region country valuation. The profits of the Standard Oil\r\n  Company for the year 1886 were over $26,000,000.\r\n\r\n  Strangers may ask, Why is there no competition in pipage and storage\r\n  of oil if the profits are so great? We answer, that with rebates,\r\n  drawbacks, discrimination, and conspiracies the Standard Oil Company\r\n  has been able to freeze out and suppress nearly every attempt at\r\n  competition.\r\n\r\n  Does not the foregoing array of figures, showing as it does the\r\n  terrible shrinkage which the property of the oil producers has\r\n  sustained, amounting to nearly twenty-five per cent. in one year,\r\n  demand such relief in pipage, storage, and shrinkage, as is\r\n  contemplated by the Billingsley Bill, now before the Senate of\r\n  Pennsylvania?\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 50 (See page 2121)\r\n                          THE BILLINGSLEY BILL\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Legislature of Pennsylvania.

ROGERS\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly, 1879.\r\n  Volume III, pages 2613–2618.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was your firm’s business sold out to the Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I would like to have the question explained.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was there a sale or transfer made of your business to the\r\n  Standard Oil Company, by which practically the Standard Oil Company\r\n  really controlled your business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I will answer this much of the question, by saying that the\r\n  Standard Oil Company does not practically control our business.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do they control the rates at which your business gets the\r\n  transportation of oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That I don’t know anything about; I don’t know anything about\r\n  the rates of transportation.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Was not your firm taken in with the Standard Oil Company upon\r\n  some agreed basis or arrangement, whether you regard it as a\r\n  purchase or transfer or not?\r\n\r\n  _A._ We worked in harmony with the Standard Oil Company for a number\r\n  of years.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Upon an agreed basis of general business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Our interest was in common, to a certain extent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Has your firm any contract with the Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ That I cannot answer.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What member of your firm would be able to answer that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think Mr. Pratt would, if he were here.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When was it that your firm began to work in harmony with the\r\n  Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I cannot say exactly how long ago; seven or eight years ago we\r\n  got up a refining association here; that was the first, and then we\r\n  got up another, and we got up another, and we have always been\r\n  trying to get into some relations with all the refiners, so that we\r\n  might make some money out of the business.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Had you difficulty before you entered into relations with the\r\n  Standard Oil Company to make money out of the business?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The competition was always very sharp, and there was always\r\n  some one that was willing to sell goods for less than they cost, and\r\n  that made the market price for everything; we got up an association,\r\n  and took in all the refiners until some of them went back on us, and\r\n  that would break up the association; we tried that two or three\r\n  times.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then finally you entered the Standard Oil arrangement?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Then we made an alliance or association with some of the\r\n  refiners about here, and it was more successful.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What are the refiners about here with whom that alliance was\r\n  made, and are they or are they not all of them covered by the\r\n  Standard Oil arrangement?\r\n\r\n  _A._ They would come in and then they would go out; there is no\r\n  refiner that I know of, with one exception, about New York but what\r\n  has been in the association.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What are the refiners that are now in association of the\r\n  Standard Oil?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The people that are working in harmony with us comprise about,\r\n  I should think, 90 or 95 per cent. of the refiners.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now tell us their names, the leading ones.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Some of the leading ones? The Standard Oil Company; Charles\r\n  Pratt and Company; the Sone and Fleming Manufacturing Company;\r\n  Warden, Frew and Company of Philadelphia; the Standard Oil Company\r\n  of Pittsburg; the Acme Oil Refining Company of Titusville; the\r\n  Imperial Refining Company of Oil City; the Baltimore United Oil\r\n  Company of Baltimore.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You said that substantially 95 per cent. of the refiners were\r\n  in the Standard arrangement?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I said 90 to 95 per cent. I thought were in harmony.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of their being in harmony with the Standard,\r\n  what do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I mean just what harmony implies.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Do you mean that they have an arrangement with the Standard?\r\n\r\n  _A._ If I am in harmony with my wife, I presume I am at peace with\r\n  her, and am working with her.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You are married to her, and you have a contract with her?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is that what you mean?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, some people live in harmony without being married.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Without having a contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes; I have heard so.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, which do you mean? Do you mean the people who are in the\r\n  Standard arrangement, and are in harmony with it, are married to the\r\n  Standard or in a state of freedom—celibacy?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not necessarily, so long as they are happy.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is it the harmony that arises from a marriage contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Not necessarily, so long as they are happy.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ When you speak of their harmony, is it a relation of contract?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I mean by harmony that if you and I agree to go on Wall Street\r\n  and buy a hundred shares of Erie at 33, and we agree to sell it out\r\n  together at 40, that is harmony. I mean just the same that way—if I\r\n  go into the Standard Oil office and conclude to buy some oil of them\r\n  and agree on a fair price to sell it out at, that is harmony.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Is that the harmony that you mean—that you gentlemen have\r\n  agreed between each other the rate at which you will buy and the\r\n  rate at which you will sell?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, not going too far into detail, I would say that the\r\n  relations are very pleasant.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ But we want the detail; we want precisely what that harmony is,\r\n  what it consists of, and what produces it.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, is it a railroad abuse, or is it an abuse to be in\r\n  harmony with people?\r\n\r\n  _Q._ No; it is not abuse to be in harmony; there are some kinds of\r\n  harmony that the law considers conspiracy.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I have heard so.\r\n\r\n  By the Chairman.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What we want to know is this: This Standard Oil Company in\r\n  itself is, as we understand it, a large organisation, not very\r\n  extensive, but is made so by contracts with various other\r\n  organisations, that are not a part of it, by their written contract\r\n  or verbal contract or understanding, or whatever you term it; we\r\n  want to know whether that is not the fact, and if that is not what\r\n  you refer to when you speak about working in harmony.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Mr. Chairman, I want to give you all the information that is\r\n  necessary in this matter for your purposes, but it is a question in\r\n  my mind whether it is a proper thing for me, even if there is no\r\n  harm done by it, to divulge my business secrets.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ We do not ask you for your secrets; we simply ask you the\r\n  general nature of this organisation.\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have explained it, I think, to you quite as fully as I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 52 (See page 2136)\r\n                      THE TRUST AGREEMENT OF 1882\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Proceedings in Relation to Trusts, House of Representatives, 1888.\r\n  Report Number 3,112, pages 307–313.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  This agreement, made and entered upon this second day of January,\r\n  A.D. 1882, by and between all the persons who shall now or may\r\n  hereafter execute the same as parties thereto:\r\n\r\n  _Witnesseth_: I.

As soon as practicable a corporation shall be formed in each of\r\n  the following states, under the laws thereof, to wit, Ohio, New\r\n  York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey; provided, however, that instead of\r\n  organising a new corporation any existing charter and organisation\r\n  may be used for the purpose when it can advantageously be done.\r\n\r\n  2d. The purposes and powers of said corporations shall be to mine\r\n  for, produce, manufacture, refine, and deal in petroleum and all its\r\n  products, and all the materials used in such businesses, and\r\n  transact other business collateral thereto. But other purposes and\r\n  powers shall be embraced in the several charters such as shall seem\r\n  expedient to the parties procuring the charter, or, if necessary to\r\n  comply with the law, the powers aforesaid may be restricted and\r\n  reduced.\r\n\r\n  3d. At any time hereafter, when it may seem advisable to the\r\n  trustees herein provided for, similar corporations may be formed in\r\n  other states and territories.\r\n\r\n  4th. Each of said corporations shall be known as the Standard Oil\r\n  Company of (and here shall follow the name of the state or territory\r\n  by virtue of the laws of which said corporation is organised).\r\n\r\n  5th. The capital stock of each of said corporations shall be fixed\r\n  at such an amount as may seem necessary and advisable to the parties\r\n  organising the same, in view of the purpose to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n  6th. The shares of stock of each of said corporations shall be\r\n  issued only for money, property, or assets equal at a fair valuation\r\n  to the par value of the stock delivered therefor.\r\n\r\n  7th. All of the property, real and personal, assets and business of\r\n  each and all of the corporations and limited partnerships mentioned\r\n  or embraced in class first, shall be transferred to and vested in\r\n  the said several Standard Oil companies. All of the property,\r\n  assets, and business in or of each particular state shall be\r\n  transferred to and vested in the Standard Oil Company of that\r\n  particular state, and in order to accomplish such purpose the\r\n  directors and managers of each and all of the several corporations\r\n  and limited partnerships mentioned in class first are hereby\r\n  authorised and directed by the stockholders and members thereof (all\r\n  of them being parties to this agreement) to sell, assign, transfer,\r\n  convey, and make over, for the consideration hereinafter mentioned,\r\n  to the Standard Oil Company or companies of the proper state or\r\n  states, as soon as said corporations are organised and ready to\r\n  receive the same, all the property, real and personal, assets and\r\n  business of said corporations and limited partnerships. Correct\r\n  schedules of such property, assets, and business shall accompany\r\n  each transfer.\r\n\r\n  8th. The individuals embraced in class second of this agreement do,\r\n  each for himself, agree for the consideration hereinafter mentioned\r\n  to sell, assign, transfer, convey, and set over all the property,\r\n  real and personal, assets and business mentioned and embraced in\r\n  schedules accompanying such sale, and transfer to the Standard Oil\r\n  Company or companies of the proper state or states, as soon as the\r\n  said corporations are organised and ready to receive the same.\r\n\r\n  9th. The parties embraced in class third of this agreement do\r\n  covenant and agree to assign and transfer all of the stock held by\r\n  them in the corporations or limited partnerships herein named, to\r\n  the trustees herein provided for, for the consideration and upon the\r\n  terms hereinafter set forth. It is understood and agreed that the\r\n  said trustees and their successors may hereafter take the assignment\r\n  of stocks in the same or similar companies upon the terms herein\r\n  provided, and that whenever and as often as all the stocks of any\r\n  corporations or limited partnerships are vested in said trustees,\r\n  the proper steps may then be taken to have all the moneys, property,\r\n  real and personal, of such corporation or partnership assigned or\r\n  conveyed to the Standard Oil Company, of the proper state, on the\r\n  terms and in the mode herein set forth, in which event the trustees\r\n  shall receive stocks of the Standard Oil companies, equal to the\r\n  value of the money, property, and business assigned, to be held in\r\n  place of the stocks of the company or companies assigning such\r\n  property.\r\n\r\n  10th. The consideration for the transfer and conveyance of the\r\n  money, property, and business aforesaid to each or any of the\r\n  Standard Oil companies shall be stock of the respective Standard Oil\r\n  Company to which said transfer or conveyance is made, equal at par\r\n  value to the appraised value of the money, property, and business so\r\n  transferred. Said stock shall be delivered to the trustees\r\n  hereinafter provided for, and their successors, and no stock of any\r\n  of said companies shall ever be issued except for money, property,\r\n  or business, equal, at least, to the par value of the stock so\r\n  issued, nor shall any stock be issued by any of said companies for\r\n  any purpose, except to the trustees herein provided for, to be held\r\n  subject to the trusts hereinafter specified. It is understood,\r\n  however, that this provision is not intended to restrict the\r\n  purchase, sale, and exchange of property by said Standard Oil\r\n  companies as fully as they may be authorised to do by their\r\n  respective charters; provided only that no stock be issued therefor\r\n  except to said trustees.\r\n\r\n  11th. The consideration for any stocks delivered to said trustees,\r\n  as above provided for, as well as for stocks delivered to said\r\n  trustees by persons mentioned or included in class third of this\r\n  agreement, shall be the delivery by said trustees, to the persons\r\n  entitled thereto, of trust certificates hereinafter provided for,\r\n  equal at par value to the par value of the stocks of the said\r\n  several Standard Oil companies so received by said trustees and\r\n  equal to the appraised value of the stocks of other companies or\r\n  partnerships delivered to said trustees.\r\n\r\n  The said appraised value shall be determined in a manner agreed upon\r\n  by the parties in interest and said trustees.\r\n\r\n  It is understood and agreed, however, that the said trustees may,\r\n  with any trust funds in their hands, in addition to the mode above\r\n  provided, purchase the bonds and stocks of other companies engaged\r\n  in business similar or collateral to the business of said Standard\r\n  Oil companies on such terms and in such mode as they may deem\r\n  advisable, and shall hold the same for the benefit of the owners of\r\n  said trust certificates, and may sell, assign, transfer, and pledge\r\n  such bonds and stocks whenever they may deem it advantageous to said\r\n  trust so to do.\r\n\r\n  III. The trusts upon which said stock shall be held, and the number,\r\n  powers, and duties of said trustees shall be as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st. The number of trustees shall be nine.\r\n\r\n  2d. J. D. Rockefeller, O. H. Payne and William Rockefeller are\r\n  hereby appointed trustees, to hold their office until the first\r\n  Wednesday of April, A.D. 1885.\r\n\r\n  3d. J. A. Bostwick, H. M. Flagler and W. G. Warden are hereby\r\n  appointed trustees, to hold their office until the first Wednesday\r\n  of April, A.D. 1884.\r\n\r\n  4th. Charles Pratt, Benjamin Brewster and John Archbold are hereby\r\n  appointed trustees, to hold their office until the first Wednesday\r\n  of April, A.D. 1883.\r\n\r\n  5th. Elections for trustees to succeed those herein appointed shall\r\n  be held annually, at which election a sufficient number of trustees\r\n  shall be elected to fill all vacancies occurring either from\r\n  expiration of the term of the office of trustee or from any other\r\n  cause. All trustees shall be elected to hold their office for three\r\n  years, except those elected to fill a vacancy arising from any cause\r\n  except expiration of term, who shall be elected for the balance of\r\n  the term of the trustee whose place they are elected to fill. Every\r\n  trustee shall hold his office until his successor is elected.\r\n\r\n  6th. Trustees shall be elected by ballot by the owners of trust\r\n  certificates or their proxies. At all meetings the owners of trust\r\n  certificates, who may be registered as such on the books of the\r\n  trustees, may vote in person or by proxy, and shall have one vote\r\n  for each and every share of trust certificates standing in their\r\n  names, but no such owner shall be entitled to vote upon any share\r\n  which has not stood in his name thirty days prior to the day\r\n  appointed for the election. The transfer books may be closed for\r\n  thirty days immediately preceding the annual election. A majority of\r\n  the shares represented at such election shall elect.\r\n\r\n  7th. The annual meeting of the owners of said trust certificates for\r\n  the election of trustees, and for other business, shall be held at\r\n  the office of the trustees in the City of New York, on the first\r\n  Wednesday of April of each year, unless the place of meeting be\r\n  changed by the trustees, and said meeting may be adjourned from day\r\n  to day until its business is completed. Special meetings of the\r\n  owners of said trust certificates may be called by a majority of the\r\n  trustees, at such times and places as they may appoint. It shall\r\n  also be the duty of the trustees to call a special meeting of\r\n  holders of trust certificates whenever requested to do so by a\r\n  petition signed by the holders of ten per cent. in value of such\r\n  certificates. The business of such special meetings shall be\r\n  confined to the object specified in the notice given therefor.\r\n  Notice of the time and place of all meetings of the owners of trust\r\n  certificates shall be given by personal notice so far as possible,\r\n  and by public notice in one of the principal newspapers of each\r\n  state in which a Standard Oil Company exists, at least ten days\r\n  before such meeting. At any meeting, a majority in value of the\r\n  holders of trust certificates represented consenting thereto,\r\n  by-laws may be made, amended, and repealed relative to the mode of\r\n  the election of trustees, and other business of the holders of trust\r\n  certificates; provided, however, that said by-laws shall be in\r\n  conformity with this agreement. By-laws may also be made, amended,\r\n  and repealed at any meeting, by and with the consent of a majority\r\n  in value of the holders of trust certificates, which alter this\r\n  agreement relative to the number, powers, and duties of the\r\n  trustees, and to other matters tending to the more efficient\r\n  accomplishment of the objects for which the trust is created;\r\n  provided only, that the essential intents and purposes of this\r\n  agreement be not thereby changed.\r\n\r\n  8th. Whenever a vacancy occurs in the board of trustees, more than\r\n  sixty days prior to the annual meeting for the election of trustees,\r\n  it shall be the duty of the remaining trustees to call a meeting of\r\n  the owners of Standard Oil Trust certificates for the purpose of\r\n  electing a trustee or trustees to fill the vacancy or vacancies. If\r\n  any vacancy occurs in the board of trustees, from any cause, within\r\n  sixty days of the date of the annual meeting for the election of\r\n  trustees, the vacancy may be filled by a majority of the remaining\r\n  trustees, or, at their option, may remain vacant until the annual\r\n  election.\r\n\r\n  9th. If for any reason at any time a trustee or trustees shall be\r\n  appointed by any court to fill any vacancy or vacancies in said\r\n  board of trustees, the trustee or trustees so appointed shall hold\r\n  his or their respective office or offices only until a successor or\r\n  successors shall be elected in the manner above provided for.\r\n\r\n  10th. Whenever any change shall occur in the board of trustees, the\r\n  legal title to the stock and other property held in trust shall pass\r\n  to and vest in the successors of said trustees without any formal\r\n  transfer thereof. But if at any such time formal transfer shall be\r\n  deemed necessary or advisable, it shall be the duty of the board of\r\n  trustees to obtain the same, and it shall be the duty of any\r\n  retiring trustee, or the administrator or executor of any deceased\r\n  trustee, to make said transfer.\r\n\r\n  11th. The trustees shall prepare certificates which shall show the\r\n  interest of each beneficiary in said trust and deliver them to the\r\n  persons properly entitled thereto. They shall be divided into shares\r\n  of the par value of $100 each, and shall be known as the Standard\r\n  Oil Trust certificates, and shall be issued subject to all the terms\r\n  and conditions of this agreement. The trustees shall have power to\r\n  agree upon and direct the form and contents of said certificates and\r\n  the mode in which they shall be signed, attested, and transferred.\r\n  The certificates shall contain an express stipulation that the\r\n  holders thereof shall be bound by the terms of this agreement and by\r\n  the by-laws herein provided for.\r\n\r\n  12th. No certificates shall be issued except for stocks and bonds\r\n  held in trust as herein provided for, and the par value of\r\n  certificates issued by said trustees shall be equal to the par value\r\n  of the stocks of said Standard Oil Company and the appraised value\r\n  of other bonds and stocks held in trust. The various bonds, stocks,\r\n  and moneys held under said trust shall be held for all parties in\r\n  interest jointly, and the trust certificates so issued shall be the\r\n  evidence of the interest held by the several parties in this trust.\r\n  No duplicate certificates shall be issued by the trustees, except\r\n  upon surrender of the original certificate or certificates for\r\n  cancellation, or upon satisfactory proof of the loss thereof, and in\r\n  the latter case they shall require a sufficient bond of indemnity.\r\n\r\n  13th. The stocks of the various Standard Oil companies, held in\r\n  trust by said trustees, shall not be sold, assigned, or transferred\r\n  by said trustees, or by the beneficiaries, or by both combined, so\r\n  long as this trust endures. The stocks and bonds of other\r\n  corporations held by said trustees may be by them exchanged or sold\r\n  and the proceeds thereof distributed _pro rata_ to the holders of\r\n  trust certificates, or said proceeds may be held and reinvested by\r\n  said trustees for the purposes and uses of the trust; provided,\r\n  however, that said trustees may, from time to time, assign such\r\n  shares of stock of said Standard Oil Company as may be necessary to\r\n  qualify any person or persons chosen or to be chosen as directors\r\n  and officers of any of said Standard Oil companies.\r\n\r\n  14th. It shall be the duty of said trustees to receive and safely to\r\n  keep all interest and dividends declared and paid upon any of the\r\n  said bonds, stocks, and moneys held by them in trust, and to\r\n  distribute all moneys received from such sources or from sales of\r\n  trust property or otherwise by declaring and paying dividends upon\r\n  the Standard Trust certificates as funds accumulate which in their\r\n  judgment are not needed for the use and expenses of said trust. The\r\n  trustees shall, however, keep separate accounts of receipts from\r\n  interest and dividends, and of receipts from sales or transfers of\r\n  trust property, and in making any distribution of trust funds, in\r\n  which moneys derived from sales or transfers shall be included,\r\n  shall render the holders of trust certificates a statement showing\r\n  what amount of the fund distributed has been derived from such sales\r\n  or transfers. The said trustees may be also authorised and empowered\r\n  by a vote of a majority in value of holders of trust certificates,\r\n  whenever stocks or bonds have accumulated in their hands from moneys\r\n  purchases thereof, or the stocks or bonds held by them have\r\n  increased in value, or stock dividends shall have been declared by\r\n  any of the companies whose stocks are held by said trustees, or\r\n  whenever, from any such cause, it is deemed advisable so to do, to\r\n  increase the amount of trust certificates to the extent of such\r\n  increase or accumulation of values and to divide the same among the\r\n  persons then owning trust certificates _pro rata_.\r\n\r\n  15th. It shall be the duty of said trustees to exercise general\r\n  supervision over the affairs of said several Standard Oil companies,\r\n  and, as far as practicable, over the other companies or\r\n  partnerships, any portion of whose stock is held in said trust. It\r\n  shall be their duty, as stockholders of said companies, to elect as\r\n  directors and officers thereof faithful and competent men. They may\r\n  elect themselves to such positions when they see fit so to do, and\r\n  shall endeavour to have the affairs of all of said companies managed\r\n  and directed in the manner they may deem most conducive to the best\r\n  interests of the holders of said trust certificates.\r\n\r\n  16th. All the powers of the trustees may be exercised by a majority\r\n  of their number. They may appoint from their own number an executive\r\n  and other committees. A majority of each committee shall exercise\r\n  all the powers which the trustees may confer upon such committee.\r\n\r\n  17th. The trustees may employ and pay all such agents and attorneys\r\n  as they deem necessary in the management of said trust.\r\n\r\n  18th. Each trustee shall be entitled to a salary for his services\r\n  not exceeding $25,000 per annum, except the president of the board,\r\n  who may be voted a salary not exceeding $30,000 per annum, which\r\n  salaries shall be fixed by said board of trustees. All salaries and\r\n  expenses connected with or growing out of the trust shall be paid by\r\n  the trustees from the trust fund.\r\n\r\n  19th. The board of trustees shall have its principal office in the\r\n  City of New York, unless changed by a vote of the trustees, at which\r\n  office, or in some place of safe deposit in said city, the bonds and\r\n  stocks shall be kept. The trustees shall have power to adopt rules\r\n  and regulations pertaining to the meetings of the board, the\r\n  election of officers, and the management of the trust.\r\n\r\n  20th. The trustees shall render at each annual meeting a statement\r\n  of the affairs of the trust. If a termination of the trust be agreed\r\n  upon, as hereinafter provided, or within a reasonable time prior to\r\n  its termination by a lapse of time, the trustees shall furnish to\r\n  the holders of trust certificates a true and perfect inventory and\r\n  appraisement of all stocks and other property held in trust, and a\r\n  statement of the financial affairs of the various companies whose\r\n  stocks are held in trust.\r\n\r\n  21st. This trust shall continue during the lives of the survivors\r\n  and survivor of the trustees in this agreement named, and for\r\n  twenty-one years thereafter: provided, however, that if, at anytime\r\n  after the expiration of ten years, two-thirds of all the holders in\r\n  value, or if, after the expiration of one year, ninety per cent. of\r\n  all the holders in value of trust certificates, shall, at a meeting\r\n  of holders of trust certificates called for that purpose, vote to\r\n  terminate this trust at some time to be by them then and there\r\n  fixed, the said trust shall terminate at the date so fixed. If the\r\n  holders of trust certificates shall vote to terminate the trust as\r\n  aforesaid, they may, at the same meeting, or at a subsequent meeting\r\n  called for that purpose, decide by a vote of two-thirds in value of\r\n  their number the mode in which the affairs of the trust shall be\r\n  wound up, and whether the trust property shall be distributed, or\r\n  whether it shall be sold and the values thereof distributed; or\r\n  whether part, and, if so, what part, shall be divided and what part\r\n  shall be sold, and whether such sales shall be public or private.\r\n\r\n  The trustees, who shall continue to hold their offices for that\r\n  purpose, shall make the distribution in the mode directed; or, if no\r\n  mode be agreed upon by two-thirds in value, as aforesaid, the\r\n  trustees shall make distribution of the trust property according to\r\n  law. But said distribution, however made, and whether it be of\r\n  property or values, or of both, shall be just and equitable, and\r\n  such as to insure to each owner of a trust certificate his due\r\n  proportion of the trust property, or the value thereof.\r\n\r\n  22d. If the trust shall be terminated by expiration of the time for\r\n  which it is created, the distribution of the trust property shall be\r\n  directed and made in the mode above provided.\r\n\r\n  23d. This agreement, together with the registry of certificates,\r\n  books of accounts, and other books and papers connected with the\r\n  business of said trust, shall be safely kept at the principal office\r\n  of said trustees.\r\n\r\n    BENJ.

Now, it is hereby mutually agreed\r\n  between the parties to the said trust agreement, and as\r\n  supplementary thereto, that the trustees named in the said agreement\r\n  and their successors shall have the power and authority to decide\r\n  what companies shall convey their said property as in said agreement\r\n  contemplated, and when the said sales and transfers shall take\r\n  place, if at all; and until said trustees shall so decide, each of\r\n  said companies shall remain in existence and retain its property and\r\n  business, and the trustees shall hold the stocks thereof in trust as\r\n  in said agreement provided. In the exercise of said discretion, the\r\n  trustees shall act by a majority of their number as provided in said\r\n  trust agreement. All portions of said trust agreement relating to\r\n  this subject shall be considered so changed as to be in harmony with\r\n  this supplemental agreement.\r\n\r\n  _In Witness Whereof_, the said parties have subscribed this\r\n  agreement, this fourth day of January, 1882.\r\n\r\n    BENJAMIN BREWSTER; JOHN D.

Rockefeller and his assigns the legal title to the\r\n    aforesaid amount of the said stocks and authorise the proper\r\n    officers of the several corporations to transfer upon their\r\n    books and to issue corporate certificates for the required\r\n    amount of their respective capital stocks upon presentation and\r\n    cancellation of this assignment. The several corporations will\r\n    issue stock certificates for whole shares and scrip for\r\n    fractions of shares and upon presentation of fractional share\r\n    scrip sufficient for the purpose, certificates for whole shares\r\n    will be issued. When transfer of stock upon the corporate books\r\n    is desired by virtue of this assignment, it must be placed in\r\n    the hands of an attorney in fact, both for the assignee and the\r\n    undersigned trustees, and said attorney shall first obtain the\r\n    proper certificates and scrip from all the several companies,\r\n    and thereupon shall deliver the certificates to the trustees and\r\n    the stock certificates and scrip to the party or parties\r\n    entitled thereto.\r\n\r\n           (Signed in print) JOHN D.

Phillips and others, whose names will be found\r\n  in the schedule hereto attached and made part of this agreement, as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, there has accumulated in past years an excessive stock of\r\n  crude petroleum, which is deteriorating in quality, and a portion of\r\n  which each year becomes sediment, valueless for any purpose, and the\r\n  carrying of which excessive stock requires the expenditure of vast\r\n  sums annually; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_, in consequence of the existence of said stock the price\r\n  of crude petroleum has for the past year been largely below the cost\r\n  at which the same was produced; now, in order as far as possible to\r\n  preserve the said stock from further waste, and to conserve the\r\n  public interest and our own, this agreement _witnesseth_:\r\n\r\n  That the Standard Oil Company of New York will set apart at\r\n  sixty-two cents per barrel, and hold for the use of the above-named\r\n  producers and those who shall hereafter become parties to this\r\n  agreement, as hereinafter provided, 5,000,000 barrels of\r\n  merchantable crude petroleum, of forty-two gallons each, to be sold\r\n  and disposed of in the manner hereinafter provided. The said\r\n  5,000,000 barrels of petroleum to be subject, until sold by the said\r\n  producers, to the usual assessments, storage charges, and interest\r\n  upon the same, as also interest on the price of said petroleum, at\r\n  sixty-two cents per barrel; said assessments, charges, and interest\r\n  to be added to the price aforesaid.\r\n\r\n  In consideration of which the above-named producers agree to limit\r\n  their production of petroleum, that for the year next ensuing from\r\n  this date, they or any number of them shall, for said year,\r\n  collectively produce at least 17,500 barrels of crude petroleum less\r\n  per day than they or any number of them collectively produced per\r\n  day for the months of July and August, 1887, and that they will use\r\n  every reasonable endeavour to control their production so that the\r\n  same shall be in the aggregate 30,000 barrels less per day than it\r\n  was during the said period of July and August, 1887.\r\n\r\n  If at the end of three months from the date hereof the said\r\n  reduction of 17,500 barrels per day shall be attained, to be\r\n  measured by taking the average production of the above-named\r\n  producers for the months of December and January next, and comparing\r\n  the same with their average production for the months of July and\r\n  August, 1887, a statement of the same being hereto attached and made\r\n  part of this agreement, then the said 5,000,000 barrels of petroleum\r\n  shall be delivered as fast as the same shall be sold by, upon the\r\n  order, and for the account of said producers through their executive\r\n  committee appointed by agreement between themselves, and hereinafter\r\n  named, to be paid for with interest and storage as delivered; that\r\n  the profits aforesaid upon said 5,000,000 barrels of petroleum as\r\n  sold, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement, shall, by\r\n  said Standard Oil Company and said producers’ executive committee,\r\n  be deposited with the United States Trust Company in New York City,\r\n  until the expiration of one year from the date hereof, in trust, in\r\n  accordance with and subject to the provisions of this agreement; and\r\n  in case the above-named producers or any number of them shall not\r\n  have lessened their production 17,500 barrels per day for said year\r\n  as aforesaid, then all of said profits upon said 5,000,000 barrels\r\n  of petroleum shall belong and be paid to the Standard Oil Company of\r\n  New York; and in case the said above-named producers or any number\r\n  of them collectively shall have lessened their production 17,500\r\n  barrels per day for the said year as aforesaid, then the entire\r\n  profits aforesaid upon the 5,000,000 barrels of petroleum shall be\r\n  paid to said producers’ executive committee, to be by it distributed\r\n  in accordance with agreements between themselves to such of said\r\n  producers as have fulfilled the terms of this agreement, and all\r\n  agreements between themselves relating to such distributions.\r\n\r\n  The said producers are guaranteed by said Standard Oil Company of\r\n  New York against loss within said year upon said 5,000,000 barrels\r\n  of petroleum. The lessening of 17,500 barrels per day above provided\r\n  shall embrace and include any reduction or lessening of production\r\n  by producers who shall sign contracts not to use means to increase\r\n  their production by drilling or otherwise.\r\n\r\n  Producers may become parties to this agreement within the year the\r\n  contract is to operate by signing the agreement between producers\r\n  authorising the executive committee to sign this contract on their\r\n  behalf, and having their names added hereto as parties by said\r\n  executive committee.\r\n\r\n  The following-named persons constitute the executive committee above\r\n  referred to, to wit:\r\n\r\n              (Names omitted by consent of the chairman.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 56 (See page 2187)\r\nJOHN D. ARCHBOLD’S STATEMENT TO THE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSION CONCERNING THE\r\n  STANDARD’S OPPOSITION TO THE BUILDING OF THE UNITED STATES PIPE LINE\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Industrial Commission, 1900. Volume I, page 529.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mr. Lee makes a statement regarding the difficulty of his pipe-line,\r\n  the United States Pipe Line, in crossing railroads and securing\r\n  right of way to the seaboard, and makes a general statement implying\r\n  that we have instituted and carried out great obstruction to their\r\n  progress. I want to make general denial of this statement. We have\r\n  not at any time had any different relations with reference to any\r\n  obstruction or effort at obstruction of their line than would attach\r\n  to any competitor in a line of business engaging against another.\r\n  With reference to the special features referred to by Mr. Lee, and\r\n  which he attempts, by implication at any rate, to connect us with,\r\n  in the crossing of the Delaware and Lackawanna Railroad in New\r\n  Jersey, I want to say that the contention in that respect was\r\n  entirely at the hands of the railroad, and not at our hands in any\r\n  possible respect. They went there surreptitiously and endeavoured to\r\n  force their way, on a Sunday, over a line where they had no right,\r\n  either by private purchase or by public franchise. Having\r\n  accomplished the crossing of the road in that surreptitious way,\r\n  they stationed there an armed force to prevent the railroad company\r\n  from asserting its rights and taking out their lines, and kept that\r\n  force there for a long period. The railroad went about it in a\r\n  peaceful way, in the courts, and the final result is that the\r\n  decision is against the line, after the case has been carried up\r\n  finally to the supreme court of the state, and they must, of course,\r\n  remove their line. But any statement on Mr. Lee’s part, or any other\r\n  witness, that we had anything to do with that matter, or with\r\n  reference to any of the difficulties interposed in their progress to\r\n  the seaboard, is absolutely false.\r\n\r\n  By Mr. Phillips.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Did your company own in fee simple the tract of ground, and was\r\n  a roadway reserved by the landholder? Was that purchased by them?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was not my case, and I am not conversant with the details\r\n  regarding it. The fact that, after having been fought in the\r\n  newspapers and in the courts for a term of years, seeking the\r\n  sympathy of the judges as well as the public, the supreme court of\r\n  the state has ruled against them, is the best evidence, I think,\r\n  that the right was against them. I want to say with reference to our\r\n  pipe lines, that we never endeavoured to cross any man’s right of\r\n  way without first seeing him about it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Still, did they not go through the railroad on their own\r\n  ground, and was not this the final decision, that they had not the\r\n  right to lay a pipe line where a man had reserved a right of way\r\n  under the ground?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It was not only decided that they had no right there, but they\r\n  were ordered to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 57 (See page 2194)\r\n          TABLES OF YEARLY AVERAGE PRICES OF CRUDE AND REFINED\r\n\r\n\r\n  [All quotations up to 1899 are from the Oil City Derrick; all\r\n  quotations for 1900–1903 are from the New York Commercial.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TABLE OF YEARLY AVERAGE PRICE OF CRUDE\r\n\r\n  In the following table is presented the highest and lowest price of\r\n  oil, the months in which these quotations occurred, and the general\r\n  average for each year. The “average” as estimated is usually the\r\n  mean price between the highest and lowest quotation of a given time.\r\n  It is sufficiently accurate for general purposes of comparison. It\r\n  would be an almost impossible task to determine a “true average”\r\n  from the reports of the daily sales that are now on record. Previous\r\n  to 1875 the quotations are given for points along Oil Creek, and\r\n  they hardly represent what the producer actually realised for oil at\r\n  the wells. From 1875 onward the trading in oil was placed on a more\r\n  satisfactory basis by the general adoption of pipe-line\r\n  certificates, and the exchange quotations show very closely the\r\n  value of the oil at the wells. When the certificate was finally\r\n  purchased by the refiner, it was subject to a uniform charge for\r\n  pipage of the oil from the wells to the nearest shipping point.\r\n\r\n      ─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n        YEAR   │ Highest │  Price  │ Lowest  │  Price  │ Average\r\n               │  Month  │         │  Month  │         │\r\n      ─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n        1859   │Sept.    │  $20.00 │Dec.     │  $20.00 │  $20.00\r\n        1860   │Jan.     │   20.00 │Dec.     │    2.00 │    9.60\r\n        1861   │Jan.     │    1.75 │Dec.     │     .10 │     .52\r\n        1862   │Dec.     │    2.50 │Jan.     │     .10 │    1.05\r\n        1863   │Dec.     │    4.00 │Jan.     │    2.00 │    3.15\r\n        1864   │July     │   14.00 │Feb.     │    3.75 │    8.15\r\n        1865   │Jan.     │   10.00 │Aug.     │    4.00 │    6.59\r\n        1866   │Jan.     │    5.50 │Dec.     │    1.35 │    3.75\r\n        1867   │Oct.     │    4.00 │June     │    1.50 │    2.40\r\n        1868   │July     │    5.75 │Jan.     │    1.70 │    3.62½\r\n        1869   │Jan.     │    7.00 │Dec.     │    4.25 │    5.60\r\n        1870   │Jan.     │    4.90 │Aug.     │    2.75 │    3.90\r\n        1871   │June     │    5.25 │Jan.     │    3.25 │    4.40\r\n        1872   │Oct.     │    4.55 │Dec.     │    2.67½│    3.75\r\n        1873   │Jan.     │    2.75 │Nov.     │     .82½│    1.80\r\n        1874   │Feb.     │    2.25 │Nov.     │     .62½│    1.15\r\n        1875   │Feb.     │    1.82½│Jan.     │     .75 │    1.24¾\r\n        1876   │Dec.     │    4.23¾│Jan.     │    1.47½│    2.57⅝\r\n        1877   │Jan.     │    3.69⅜│June     │    1.53¾│    2.39⅜\r\n        1878   │Feb.     │    1.87½│Sept.    │     .78¾│    1.17⅛\r\n        1879   │Dec.     │    1.28¾│June     │     .63⅛│     .85⅝\r\n        1880   │June     │    1.24¾│April    │     .71¼│     .94⅛\r\n        1881   │Sept.    │    1.01¼│July     │     .72½│     .85¾\r\n        1882   │Nov.     │    1.37 │July     │    0.49¼│    0.78½\r\n        1883   │June     │    1.24¾│Jan.     │     .83¼│    1.05⅞\r\n        1884   │Jan.     │    1.15⅝│June     │     .51¼│     .83⅝\r\n        1885   │Oct.     │    1.12⅝│Jan.     │     .68 │     .88⅜\r\n        1886   │Jan.     │     .92¼│Aug.     │     .59¾│     .71⅜\r\n        1887   │Dec.     │     .90 │July     │     .54 │     .66⅝\r\n        1888   │Mar.     │    1.00 │June     │     .71⅜│     .87\r\n        1889   │Nov.     │    1.12½│April    │     .79½│     .94⅛\r\n        1890   │Jan.     │    1.07⅝│Dec.     │     .60¾│     .86⅝\r\n        1891   │Feb.     │     .81⅜│Aug.     │     .50 │     .66⅞\r\n        1892   │Jan.     │     .64⅛│Oct.     │     .50 │     .55½\r\n        1893   │Dec.     │     .80 │Jan.     │     .52⅞│     .64\r\n        1894   │Dec.     │     .95¾│Jan.     │     .78½│     .83¾\r\n        1895   │April    │    2.60 │Jan.     │     .95¼│    1.35¼\r\n        1896   │Jan.     │    1.50 │Dec.     │     .90 │    1.19\r\n        1897   │Mar.     │     .96 │Oct.     │     .65 │     .78⅜\r\n        1898   │Dec.     │    1.19 │Jan.     │     .65 │     .91⅛\r\n        1899   │Dec.     │    1.66 │Feb.     │    1.13 │    1.29⅜\r\n        1900   │Mar.     │    1.68 │Nov.     │    1.07 │    1.35¼\r\n        1901   │Nov.     │    1.30 │June     │    1.05 │    1.21½\r\n        1902   │Dec.     │    1.44½│Mar.     │    1.15 │    1.23\r\n        1903   │Dec.     │    1.88 │Mar.     │    1.50 │    1.58¾\r\n      ─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\n\r\n          TABLE OF YEARLY AND MONTHLY AVERAGE PRICE OF REFINED\r\n\r\n  In the following table is given the average monthly and yearly\r\n  prices of refined oil per gallon, in barrels, in New York, from\r\n  January, 1863, to December, 1903.

1890, inclusive,\r\n  are noted in cents and fractional parts of a cent; from 1891 to 1903\r\n  the prices are given in cents and decimal parts of a cent, _i.e._,\r\n  7.42 signifies seven and forty-two hundredths cents, and 9⅜ means\r\n  nine and three eighths cents per gallon. The above are New York\r\n  quotations in barrels; bulk oil is generally 2.50c. below these\r\n  prices. Philadelphia and Baltimore quotations are five points below\r\n  New York; for instance, if New York price was 5.75c., the\r\n  Philadelphia and Baltimore price would be 5.70c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 58 (See page 2225)\r\n  JOHN D. ARCHBOLD’S STATEMENT ON THE PRICES THE STANDARD RECEIVES FOR\r\n                              REFINED OIL\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Industrial Commission, 1900. Volume I, pages\r\n  569–570.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Now, the general result then is this: By virtue of your greater\r\n  power you are enabled to secure prices that on the whole could be\r\n  considered steadily somewhat above competitive rates?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I hope so. I think we have better merchandising\r\n  facilities, better marketing facilities, better distributing\r\n  facilities, and better talent than a competitor can have.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ I am not asking with reference to your power of making profits,\r\n  but it is with reference to getting the prices from the consumer.\r\n\r\n  _A._ Prices are what make the profit. If we had a better average\r\n  price, we could get a better profit.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You think, generally speaking, that you get prices for oil\r\n  slightly above competitive prices?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I should think so; I could not answer—that is a very\r\n  general question, and very difficult to answer. I could not answer\r\n  that specifically. I hope that we do.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Of course, in this investigation, we are seeing if we can get\r\n  some general principles on which legislation might be based, and\r\n  these questions are to bring out, if we can, the power that so great\r\n  an organisation has in fixing prices. Would you say, then, that in\r\n  the case of an organisation that controls perhaps eighty per cent.\r\n  of the markets of the country, there is a monopolistic element that\r\n  enters in which enables them to hold prices above the regular rate?\r\n  Is there a monopolistic power that comes merely from the power of\r\n  capital itself?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Undoubtedly, there is an ability, and when that ability, as I\r\n  have said, is unwisely used, it is sure to bring its own defeat.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If that ability goes to get an exorbitant price, of course it\r\n  will invite competition, but when that ability is kept within modest\r\n  limits, would you still say that it was in the power of such an\r\n  organisation to get the benefit of the monopolistic power that comes\r\n  merely from the power of capital itself?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, I should say that that would be a very restricted power,\r\n  a very restricted limit. The competitors in this country are very\r\n  active.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ What?\r\n\r\n  _A._ The competitors are very active; they are alert at all points\r\n  with their small offerings in the hope to find just such a condition\r\n  as you describe.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Certainly.\r\n\r\n  _A._ But as I say, as business is and as it has been for many years,\r\n  we could not have that ability to any considerable extent as\r\n  merchants.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ If the ability were operative only to a slight extent, would it\r\n  still be enough, do you think, to make a difference between what we\r\n  may call a moderate dividend, say 6 or 7 per cent., and a pretty\r\n  high dividend of between 15 and 20 per cent.?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Well, that involves so nice a question that I could hardly\r\n  undertake to answer it; but generally as to the effect on the\r\n  community, I should say——\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Generally on the prices in the United States?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I should say that the lessened cost incident to doing business\r\n  in a large volume would more than compensate the consumer for any\r\n  ability in getting higher prices.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Then that leads to this point, whether the large capital does\r\n  itself give an organisation the power to get a somewhat higher price\r\n  than it could in the market provided the competitors were\r\n  substantially equal in power?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Oh, it may be so, but that is a difficult question to answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 59 (See page 2254)\r\n        W. H. VANDERBILT’S CHARACTERISATION OF STANDARD OIL MEN\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Report of the Special Committee on Railroads, New York Assembly,\r\n  1879. Volume II, pages 1668–1669.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Can you attribute, or do you attribute, in your own mind, the\r\n  fact of there being one refiner instead of fifty, now, to any other\r\n  cause except the larger capital of the Standard Oil Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ There are a great many causes; it is not from their capital\r\n  alone that they have built up this business; there is no question\r\n  about it but that these men—and if you come in contact with them I\r\n  guess you will come to the same conclusion I have long ago—I think\r\n  they are smarter fellows than I am, a good deal; they are very\r\n  enterprising and smart men; never came in contact with any class of\r\n  men as smart and able as they are in their business, and I think a\r\n  great deal is to be attributed to that.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Would that alone monopolise a business of that sort?\r\n\r\n  _A._ It would go a great way toward building it up; they never could\r\n  have got in the position they are in now without a great deal of\r\n  ability, and one man would hardly have been able to do it; it is a\r\n  combination of men.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Wasn’t it a combination that embraced the smart men in the\r\n  railways, as well as the smart men in the Standard Company?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I think these gentlemen from their shrewdness have been able to\r\n  take advantage of the competition that existed between the railroads\r\n  for their business, as it grew, and that they have availed\r\n  themselves of that there is not a question of doubt.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Don’t you think they have also been able to make their\r\n  affiliations with railroad companies and railroad officers?\r\n\r\n  _A._ I have not heard it charged that any railway official has any\r\n  interest in any of their companies, only what I used to see in the\r\n  papers some years ago, that I had an interest in it.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ Your interest in your railway is so large a one that nobody\r\n  would conceive, as a matter of personal interest, that you would\r\n  have an interest antagonistic to your road?\r\n\r\n  _A._ When they came to do business with us in any magnitude; that is\r\n  the reason I disposed of my interest.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ And that is the only way you can account for the enormous\r\n  monopoly that has thus grown up?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes; they are very shrewd men; I don’t believe that by any\r\n  legislative enactment or anything else through any of the states or\r\n  all of the states, you can keep such men as them down; you can’t do\r\n  it; they will be on top all the time; you see if they are not.\r\n\r\n  _Q._ You think they get on top of the railways?\r\n\r\n  _A._ Yes; and on top of everybody that comes in contact with them;\r\n  too smart for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       NUMBER 60 (See page 2259)\r\n                FAC-SIMILE OF ONE OF MR.

Professor Silliman’s report on petroleum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  An elastic pole of ash or hickory, twelve to twenty feet long, was\r\n  fastened at one end to work over a fulcrum. To the other end stirrups\r\n  were attached, or a tilting platform was secured, by which two or\r\n  three men produced a jerking motion that drew down the pole, its\r\n  elasticity pulling it back with sufficient force, when the men\r\n  slackened their hold, to raise the tools a few inches. The principle\r\n  resembled that of the treadle-board of a sewing machine, operating\r\n  which moves the needle up and down. The tools were swung in the\r\n  driving pipe, or the “conductor”—a wooden tube eight or ten inches\r\n  square, placed endwise in a hole dug to the rock—and fixed by a rope\r\n  to the spring pole, two or three feet from the workmen. The strokes\r\n  were rapid, and a sand pump—a spout three inches in diameter, with a\r\n  hinged bottom opening inward and a valve working on a sliding rod,\r\n  somewhat in the manner of a syringe—removed the borings mainly by\r\n  sucking them into the spout as it was drawn out quickly. _McLaurin’s\r\n  “History of Petroleum.”_\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  In 1871 the petroleum exports were 152,195,167 gallons. The production\r\n  was 5,795,000 barrels, or 243,390,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Estimate of J. T. Henry in his “Early and Later History of Petroleum,”\r\n  1873.
