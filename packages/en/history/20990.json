lineal\r\nsuccession and undoubted right,\" heir to the throne of England, now that\r\nElizabeth was dead, illustrates again the ancient right of the citizens of\r\nLondon to a voice in electing a successor to the crown. The document not\r\nonly acknowledges the assistance received by the lords of the realm from\r\nthe lord mayor, aldermen and citizens of London in determining the\r\nsuccession, but at the very head of the signatories to the proclamation\r\nstands the name of \"Robert Lee, Maior,\" precedence being allowed him over\r\nthe primate and other lords spiritual and temporal.(1)\r\n\r\n(M2)\r\n\r\nWhatever failings the new king may have had, he possessed sufficient\r\nshrewdness to know the value of the favour of the City, which he hastened\r\nto acknowledge with \"thankfull mynde\" within a few days of his\r\naccession.(2) A reply was sent to the king’s letter the following day,\r\nsigned by the mayor and aldermen, in which, after expressing their twofold\r\nfeelings of sorrow and joy—sorrow at losing a mother in the late queen and\r\njoy at gaining a father in the person of the new king—they declared they\r\nhad used all their powers to advance his just claim to the crown, and\r\nwould preserve the city of London, the king’s Chamber, against every enemy\r\nat home or abroad. He was invited to notify his wishes to them through\r\ntheir secretary or remembrancer, \"Mr. Doctor Fletcher,\" whom they sent as\r\ntheir special messenger.(3) The king returned for answer, that although he\r\nhad been already aware of the City’s forwardness in joining with the\r\nnobility in proclaiming him rightful successor to the crown, he was\r\npleased to learn from their trusty messenger that the citizens had\r\nadvocated his cause not only from the consciousness of its being a just\r\none, but also because they were assured of his zeal for the preservation\r\nof religion.(4) This was one of James’s mystifying remarks which he was\r\naccustomed to throw out in order to raise the hopes of the Catholics, who\r\nquestioned his title to the crown, whilst affording no cause for alarm or\r\ndiscontent among the Protestants.\r\n\r\n(M3)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th April James left Edinburgh for London, where every precaution\r\nwas taken to prevent disturbance by ridding the streets of rogues,\r\nvagabonds and \"masterless\" men.(5) He proceeded southward by easy stages,\r\naccompanied by a long retinue of Scotsmen, until he reached Theobald’s, at\r\nthat time the mansion house of Sir Robert Cecil, but soon to become a\r\nroyal hunting-lodge. On the 19th the mayor issued his precept to the\r\nlivery companies to prepare a certain number of members to accompany the\r\nmayor in his attendance upon the king, who was shortly expected in the\r\ncity. It was intended that not only the mayor and aldermen but also the\r\nfull number of 500 of the \"best and gravest\" citizens should wait upon his\r\nmajesty on horseback, clothed in coats of velvet with velvet sleeves and\r\nadorned with chains of gold, and each accompanied by \"one comlie person,\r\nwell apparelled in his doublet and hose,\" on foot. In a word, the\r\ncavalcade was to be furnished on a more sumptuous scale than had yet been\r\nseen within the memory of man.(6) The Court of Aldermen in the meantime\r\nappointed a committee to consider what suits were \"fitt to be made to the\r\nKinges most excellent Maiestye for ye good of this Cittie and the\r\nenlarging of the libertyes and priviledge of the same.\"(7)\r\n\r\n(M4)\r\n\r\nAfter resting a few days at Theobald’s, James set out (7 May) for the last\r\nstage of his journey. At Stamford Hill he was met by the mayor and\r\naldermen and a deputation from the livery companies. At every\r\nstopping-place on his journey from Scotland he had lavishly bestowed\r\nknighthoods.(8) On the 11th May he entered the Tower of London, having\r\ncome from Whitehall by water for fear of the plague which was ravaging the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n(M5)\r\n\r\nThe coronation ceremony was hurried over owing to the presence of the\r\nplague. Only the mayor, the aldermen and twelve of the principal citizens\r\nwere permitted to attend, and much labour bestowed on preparations for the\r\nevent was consequently lost.(9) The civic authorities did their utmost to\r\nstay the sickness and alleviate distress. The streets were ordered to be\r\nkept better cleansed. Infected houses were marked with papers bearing the\r\nwords \"Lord have mercy upon us,\" and when these were torn down a red\r\npainted cross, fourteen inches in length and breadth, and not so easily\r\neffaced, was added.(10) Persons stricken with the plague were forbidden to\r\nleave their houses. A master who had been inhuman enough to turn out into\r\nthe street a domestic servant who had fallen a victim to the prevailing\r\ndisorder was ordered by the Court of Aldermen to take her back again into\r\nhis house,(11) a circumstance which seems to point to the pest-house or\r\nhospital being already overcrowded. Instructions were given for seeing\r\nthat the graves of those who died of the plague were sufficiently covered\r\nwith earth, and that the number of mourners attending funerals should be\r\nas far as possible limited. Women whose duty it was to search the bodies\r\nof the dead, as well as all those who were brought into contact with the\r\nsick, were forbidden to go abroad unless they carried before them a red\r\nrod three feet in length in order to give notice to passers by. It was a\r\ncommon belief that infection was carried about by stray dogs. To those,\r\ntherefore, who killed dogs found in the streets without an owner a reward\r\nwas given.(12) The sufferings of the afflicted were alleviated, as far as\r\ncircumstances permitted, by money subscribed by the livery companies,\r\nwhich were further called upon to forego their customary banquets in order\r\nto relieve the poor.(13) The plague was accompanied, as was usually the\r\ncase, with a scarcity of corn, and again the assistance of the companies\r\nwas invoked.(14)\r\n\r\n(M6)\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year (1603) the city was almost free of the plague, and\r\nin the following March (1604) James determined to make his first public\r\nentry into London. A sum of £400 was raised by the livery companies(15)\r\nfor furnishing pageants and stands for the occasion, and steps were taken\r\nto remove from the streets everything that might be offensive to the\r\nking’s eye or ear. Thursday, the 15th March, was the day fixed for his\r\nentry, and from the preceding Wednesday until the following Friday no\r\nrefuse of any kind was to be thrown into the street.(16) It was further\r\nordered that no church bells should be rung before seven o’clock in the\r\nevening of the eventful day, lest the noise should prove offensive and\r\nhinder his majesty from hearing the speeches that were to be made.(17)\r\nWhen all was over and the pageants were about to be taken down, the Court\r\nof Aldermen, with the frugal mind of men of business, ordered the master\r\nand wardens of the Company of Painter Stainers to examine the painters’\r\nwork bestowed on them, and report whether, in their opinion, such work had\r\nbeen well and honestly executed, and what amount of remuneration the\r\nworkmen deserved.(18) It is said that the Recorder, Sir Henry Montagu,\r\nwelcomed the king on this occasion with a speech, wishing him on behalf of\r\nthe city \"a golden reigne,\" and that a cup of gold was presented to the\r\nking, the queen and the young prince who accompanied them\r\nrespectively;(19) but no record of the speech or gifts appears in the\r\nCity’s archives.\r\n\r\n(M7)\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions James had to decide on his accession to the\r\nthrone was that of religious toleration; and his settlement of the\r\nquestion was anxiously looked for as well by the Puritans as the\r\nCatholics. The fear lest the policy which the king should advocate might\r\nprove adverse to their interests determined the Catholics to resort to\r\nstrong measures, and the life of James was threatened by a series of\r\nplots, as that of Elizabeth had been before him. Among these was a plan\r\nfor seizing the king at Greenwich on Midsummer-day, 1603. The plan was\r\nlaid by a secular priest named William Watson, who had previously sounded\r\nJames as to his probable attitude to the Catholics if he came to the\r\nthrone, Sir Griffin Markham, a Catholic gentleman, who for private reasons\r\nwas discontented with the government, and one Antony Copley. News of the\r\nplot having reached the government, the conspirators fled for their lives.\r\nProclamations were issued for their capture,(20) in which details were\r\ngiven of their personal appearance. Thus Watson was described as a man of\r\nthe lowest sort about thirty-six years of age, \"he lookethe a squinte and\r\nis verie purblynde,\" and had formerly worn a long beard which he was\r\nbelieved to have cut off; whilst Sir Griffin Markham is credited with\r\nhaving a large broad face of a \"bleake\" complexion, a big nose, and a hand\r\nmaimed by a bullet. His brethren \"have all verie greate noses.\" Copley’s\r\ndescription is not given, but we have that of another conspirator, William\r\nClarke, a priest, whose hair is represented as having been \"betwixte redd\r\nand yeallowe.\" The whole party was subsequently taken, one after another,\r\nand their examination disclosed traces of another conspiracy, the object\r\nof which was to place Arabella Stuart on the throne.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Watson’s conspiracy—generally known as the \"Bye\" or\r\n\"Surprise\" Plot—so alarmed the king that he lost no time in making known\r\nhis intention to exact no longer the recusancy fines. The result was such\r\nas might be expected. The Puritans were disgusted, whilst the number of\r\nrecusants increased to such an alarming extent that in February, 1604, the\r\nking took the extreme measure of ordering the expulsion of all Jesuits and\r\nSeminary priests from the country before the 19th March,(21) the day fixed\r\nfor the meeting of parliament.\r\n\r\n(M8)\r\n\r\nAs soon as parliament met a crisis was felt to be at hand; the new king\r\nand the Commons were for the first time to measure their strength. The\r\ncity’s representatives are duly recorded.(22) At the head of them was Sir\r\nHenry Billingsley,(23) a former mayor, Sir Henry Montague,(24) recently\r\nappointed Recorder of the city upon the king’s own recommendation,\r\nNicholas Fuller, of whom little is known beyond the fact that he came from\r\nBerkshire and married the daughter of Nicholas Backhouse,(25) alderman and\r\ngrocer, and Richard Gore, a merchant tailor.\r\n\r\n(M9)\r\n\r\nWith his customary self-complacency and patronising air James told the\r\nassembled Commons that he had brought them two gifts, the one peace\r\nabroad,(26) and the other the union of England with Scotland under the\r\ntitle of Great Britain,(27) and he expressed no little surprise and\r\nindignation when he found that neither one nor the other was acceptable.\r\nThe question of the union of the two kingdoms, seeing that it involved\r\nsome political difficulties necessary of solution, was referred to a\r\ncommission.(28) James showed his displeasure at the want of compliance\r\ndisplayed by the Commons by refusing to accept a scheme of commutation of\r\nhis rights of purveyance and wardship, which had now grown so burdensome.\r\n\r\n(M10)\r\n\r\nThe abuse of purveyance, more especially, had become a standing grievance\r\nto the burgesses of London as well as of other cities and towns, in spite\r\nof attempted remedies by statute or charter.(29) An offer of £50,000 a\r\nyear was made to the king by way of commuting any shred of right he might\r\nstill have to purveyance after thirty-six statutes had pronounced it\r\naltogether illegal. This, however, he refused, and the matter was allowed\r\nto drop. Two years later, almost to the day (23 April, 1606), the king\r\nendeavoured so far to remedy the evil as to issue a proclamation against\r\nexactions and illegal acts of his purveyors,(30) and yet scarcely a month\r\nelapsed before the lord mayor had occasion to call the attention of the\r\nlords of the council to the great inconvenience caused in the city by\r\ntheir recent demand for 200 carts with two horses to each, together with\r\nthe lord mayor’s own barge, for the purpose of conveying his majesty’s\r\neffects to Greenwich. As for the barge, the mayor wrote that the lord\r\nchamberlain sometimes borrowed it for conveying the king’s guard, and it\r\nmight haply be required again for the same purpose, \"but for carringe anie\r\nstuffe or lugedge whereby it maie receave hurt it was never yet required,\"\r\nand he hoped their lordships would see the matter in that light.(31)\r\n\r\n(M11)\r\n\r\nAnother important matter which occupied the attention of the House at this\r\nsession—although no reference to it appears in the City’s records of the\r\nday—was the introduction of Free Trade, to the prejudice of the chartered\r\nrights of various trading companies. The citizens of London were deeply\r\ninterested in the bill which was introduced for this purpose, for although\r\nit little affected the livery companies, it touched very closely the\r\ninterests of those companies which were incorporated for the purpose of\r\ntrading with foreign countries, such as that of the Merchant Adventurers,\r\nthe Levant Company, the Russia Company, and others. These companies had\r\nbeen formed at a time when few individuals were sufficiently wealthy to\r\nbear the risk of distant enterprises. Not every citizen was a Whitington\r\nor a Gresham. The risk incurred by these associations in undertaking\r\nvoyages to distant countries was compensated by the advantage gained by\r\nthe enjoyment of a monopoly of the trade with those countries by charter\r\nfrom the Crown. At the outset there had been no cry raised against\r\nmonopolies of this kind, but as time wore on and the merchant navy\r\nincreased, as it did in the last reign with extraordinary rapidity, a\r\nfeeling of jealousy grew up on the part of shipowners who were not members\r\nof one or other of these chartered companies. By the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century dissatisfaction with the privileges of these trading\r\ncompanies had become so general that appeals were made to the Privy\r\nCouncil. These being without effect, the whole matter was referred to a\r\nparliamentary committee. No pains were spared to get at the root of the\r\ngrievance. The committee were attended by \"a great concourse of clothiers\r\nand merchants of all parts of the realm and especially of London.\"(32)\r\nCounsel was heard in favour of the bill which had been drafted for the\r\npurpose of throwing open foreign trade to all merchants alike, and the\r\nbill was supported by all the merchants attending the committee with the\r\nexception of the merchants of London, who were represented on the occasion\r\nby the principal aldermen of the city. The free traders urged the natural\r\nright of every one to the free exercise of his own industry and the\r\nexample set by other nations. They declared that the passing of the bill\r\nwould lead to the more even distribution of wealth,(33) the greater\r\nincrease of shipping, and the augmentation of the revenues of the Crown.\r\nThe upholders of the companies, on the other hand, could find no better\r\narguments in their favour than that no company could be a monopoly\r\ninasmuch as a monopoly was something granted exclusively to a single\r\nindividual, and that if the existence of the companies was determined,\r\napprenticeship would cease and difficulties arise in collecting the king’s\r\ncustoms! After three days’ debate on the third reading the bill passed the\r\nCommons by a large majority.(34)  It met, however, with so much opposition\r\nin the House of Lords that it was eventually dropt.\r\n\r\n(M12)\r\n\r\nA quarrel afterwards arose between the king and the Commons on financial\r\nand ecclesiastical questions, and matters being brought to a deadlock, the\r\nHouse was adjourned (7 July). A few days before the adjournment the\r\nSpeaker and over a hundred members held \"a friendly and loving meeting\" at\r\nMerchant Taylors’ Hall, before departing to their country homes. The king\r\ncontributed a buck and a hogshead of wine towards the entertainment, which\r\nproved so popular that thirty more guests appeared on the scene than was\r\noriginally intended. The \"Solemn Feast\" was further graced by a\r\n\"marchpane\"—(a confection of bitter almonds and sugar)—representing the\r\nHouse of Commons sitting.(35)\r\n\r\n(M13)\r\n\r\nThree years later (17 July, 1607) the king himself honoured the company\r\nwith his presence at dinner in their hall. The Merchant Taylors would\r\ngladly have welcomed him as one of their number and admitted him to the\r\nhonorary freedom of their company, but James had already been made free of\r\nthe company of Clothworkers. His son, Prince Henry, who was present at the\r\nentertainment, declared himself willing to accept the freedom, and made\r\nthose of his suite who were not already members of some other company\r\nfollow his example.(36)\r\n\r\n(M14)\r\n\r\nIn August (1604) the king sent to borrow £20,000 from the City, a sum\r\nwhich was afterwards, at the City’s earnest request, reduced to £15,000.\r\nThe money was to be levied by order of the court of Common Council (23\r\nAug.) on the companies, according to rates agreed upon at the time of the\r\nloan of £20,000 to the late queen in 1598,(37) and it was to be delivered\r\nto Sir Thomas Lowe, the treasurer of the fund, by the 5th September. Some\r\nof the companies, however, proved remiss in paying their quota.(38)\r\n\r\n(M15)\r\n\r\nThe action of James in expelling the Jesuits and Seminary priests had in\r\nthe meantime so incensed the Catholics that a plot was set on foot for\r\nblowing up the king, the lords and commons, with gunpowder, as soon as\r\nparliament should re-assemble. In May (1604) a house had been hired by a\r\nCatholic named Robert Catesby, through which access might be gained to the\r\nbasement of the parliament-house. The party-wall, however, proved\r\nexceptionally thick, and more than a year elapsed before the necessary\r\nmining operations were complete. Catesby was assisted in his work by a\r\nSpaniard named Guy Fawkes, who assumed the name of John Johnson. In the\r\nspring of 1605 the exasperation of the Catholics was increased by James\r\nagain imposing the recusancy fines, and the little band of plotters\r\nincreased in numbers, although never allowed to become large. The design\r\nof the conspirators was rendered more easy of execution by the discovery\r\nthat a cellar reaching under the parliament-house was to be let. This was\r\nhired by one of the plotters, and a large quantity of gunpowder was safely\r\ndeposited there and carefully concealed. After several adjournments\r\nparliament was summoned to assemble on the 5th November. On the eve of its\r\nmeeting Fawkes entered the cellar with a lantern, ready to fire the train\r\nin the morning. One of the conspirators, however, Tresham by name, had\r\ngiven his friends some hint of the impending danger. Fawkes was seized and\r\ncommitted to the Tower, where he was subjected to the most horrible\r\ntorture by the king’s orders.(39) The rest of the conspirators, with the\r\nexception of Winter, took immediate flight. Hue and cry was raised,(40)\r\nand a personal description of the leaders for their better identification\r\nwas scattered throughout the country. Winter was described as \"a man of\r\nmeane stature, rather lowe than otherwise, square made, somewhat stouping,\r\nneere fortie yeares of age, his haire and beard browne, his beard not much\r\nand his haire short\"; Stephen Littleton, another conspirator, as \"a verye\r\ntall man, swarthy of complexion, of browne coloured haire, no beard or\r\nlitle, about thirty yeares of age\"; and Thomas Percy, another, as \"a tall\r\nman, with a great broad beard, a good face, the colour of his beard and\r\nhead mingled with white heares, but stoupeth somewhat in the shoulders,\r\nwell coloured in the face, long-footed, small legged.\"(41)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th November the mayor issued his precept for bonfires to be\r\nlighted that evening in the principal streets of the city in token of joy\r\nand thanksgiving for the deliverance of the king and parliament from this\r\n\"most horrible treason.\"(42) A week later (16 Nov.) another precept was\r\naddressed to the alderman of each ward to furnish an extra watch, as those\r\nwho had been engaged in safe-guarding the city had found the work too much\r\nfor them \"since the troubles begonne.\"(43) A diligent search was\r\nsubsequently ordered to be made in every cellar and vault for any illegal\r\nstore of gunpowder.(44) Fawkes and such of his fellow-conspirators as were\r\ntaken alive were brought to trial at Westminster, in January (1606), and\r\nexecuted, some in St. Paul’s Churchyard and others before the\r\nparliament-house, their quarters being afterwards placed on the city’s\r\ngates, whilst their heads were stuck up on London bridge.(45) Pending\r\ntheir trial a double watch was kept in the city and fresh halberds\r\nissued.(46)\r\n\r\nThree Jesuits were implicated in the plot, their names being John Gerrard,\r\nOswald Greenway, and Henry Garnet. Gerrard and Greenway effected their\r\nescape, but Garnet was captured after having suffered much deprivation\r\nwhilst in hiding, and was brought to trial at the Guildhall. Gerrard is\r\ndescribed as tall and well set up, but his complexion \"swart or blackish,\r\nhis face large, his cheeks sticking out and somewhat hollow underneath,\"\r\nhis hair long unless recently cut, his beard cut close, \"saving littell\r\nmustachoes and a littell tuft under his lower lippe,\" his age about forty.\r\nEqually precise descriptions are given of Greenway and Garnet; the former\r\nbeing represented as of \"meane stature, somewhat grosse,\" his hair black,\r\nhis beard bushy and brown, his forehead broad, and his age about the same\r\nas that of Gerrard; whilst Garnet is described as an older man, between\r\nfifty and sixty years of age, of fair complexion, full face and grisly\r\nhair, with a high forehead, and corpulent.(47) At his trial, which took\r\nplace on the 28th March, Garnet denied all knowledge of the plot save what\r\nhe had heard under the seal of confession. He was nevertheless convicted\r\nand executed (3 May) in St. Paul’s Churchyard.(48)\r\n\r\n(M16)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the capture and execution of the chief actors in the late\r\nconspiracy, some time elapsed before the nation recovered from the shock,\r\nand every idle rumour of mishap to the king soon became exaggerated as it\r\nflew from one end of the kingdom to the other. Thus it was that the\r\ncitizens of London awoke on the morning of Saturday, the 22nd March, to\r\nlearn that the king was reported to have been killed with a poisoned\r\ndagger whilst engaged in his favourite pursuit of hunting. The alarm thus\r\nraised was with difficulty laid to rest by the following precept(49):—\r\n\r\n\r\n    _By y_e_ Mayo_r_._\r\n\r\n    _\"Where rumo_r_ hath this morninge bine dispersed abroad within\r\n    this cittie and ells where neere about the same that his ma_ties_\r\n    person was in very greate dainger for asmuch I have even now\r\n    receaved intelligence from the lords of his ma_ties_ most\r\n    honorable__ pryvye counsell that his ma_tie_ god be thancked is in\r\n    saftie, and that I should presently make knowne the same to all\r\n    his lovinge subiects which by theis presents I doe._\r\n\r\n    _God save y_e_ kinge.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th June James signed a proclamation ordering all Priests,\r\nJesuits, Seminaries and such like to depart the kingdom before the first\r\nday of August. Any priest presenting himself to the officer of a sea-port,\r\nand acknowledging his profession, would be forwarded on his way across the\r\nsea, with the exception of Gerrard and Greenway, or Greenwell.(50)\r\n\r\n(M17)\r\n\r\nIn July of this year (1606) the king of Denmark arrived in England on a\r\nvisit to his brother-in-law, king James. The mayor, being informed by the\r\nlords of the council that the Danish fleet was already in the Thames,\r\nsummoned a Common Council (17 July) to consider what steps should be taken\r\nto give the royal visitor a befitting reception in the city. A committee\r\nwas thereupon appointed to make the necessary preparations.(51) They had\r\nbut a fortnight before them for contriving a pageant, cleansing the\r\nstreets, setting up rails and executing the thousand little things which\r\nalways require to be done on such occasions. The sum of £1,000 was raised\r\nby the livery companies,(52) and each alderman was directed to see that\r\nthe inhabitants of his ward hung out suitable tapestry from houses on the\r\nline of procession. The distinguished visitor was presented with a gold\r\ncup taken from the king’s jewel-house in the Tower. It weighed 62-3/4\r\nozs., and the City paid for it at the rate of £3 10_s._ per ounce.(53)\r\nThere was but one thing to mar the general rejoicing in the city, and that\r\nwas the presence of the plague. This necessitated special precautions\r\nbeing taken to prevent the spread of infection, and an additional number\r\nof wardens were appointed to take their stand, halberd in hand, at the\r\ndoors of infected houses on the day of the king’s visit to prevent anyone\r\ngoing in or coming out.(54)\r\n\r\n(M18)\r\n\r\nThat the chief cause of the city being so often visited by epidemics in\r\nformer days was the lack of a plentiful supply of wholesome water will\r\nscarcely be denied. When we consider with what rapidity the population of\r\nthe city increased, more especially under the Tudors, the short-sighted\r\npolicy of a government which forbade the erection of new buildings within\r\nthree miles of the city’s gates,(55) and drove so many families to find\r\nshelter under one roof within the limited area of the city proper, in\r\nspite of proclamations to the contrary,(56) the want of any organised\r\nsystem of drainage, and the scanty supply of water—we can only marvel that\r\nthe city was ever free from epidemics.\r\n\r\nIn 1543 the municipal authorities obtained statutory powers to amend\r\ndecayed conduits and erect new ones, as well as to bring water to the city\r\nfrom Hampstead,(57) and from that time they appear to have taken a more\r\nactive interest in the water supply. They made periodical visits to the\r\nvarious conduits, and more especially the conduit-head at Marylebone,\r\nwhere a banqueting-house was erected for their convenience. Nevertheless\r\nthey preferred encouraging private individuals (and these not infrequently\r\nforeigners) in attempts to improve the city’s water supply, as necessity\r\narose, to undertaking the work themselves in their corporate capacity. In\r\n1570 the City acquired parliamentary powers to break soil for the purpose\r\nof conveying water from the river Lea, \"otherwise called Ware River,\" at\r\nany time _within the next ten years_,(58) but these powers were allowed to\r\nlapse by default. In 1581 Peter Morice, a Dutchman, obtained permission to\r\nset up a water-mill in the Thames at London Bridge, and by some mechanical\r\ncontrivance—a \"most artificial forcier\"—succeeded in conveying water as\r\nfar as Leadenhall and Gracechurch. The civic authorities were so pleased\r\nwith the result of his first efforts that they assisted him with a loan of\r\n£1,000 to perfect his work.(59) Ten years later (1591) the famous Italian\r\nengineer—of \"fire-ship\" fame—Frederico Gianibelli obtained the consent of\r\nthe Court of Aldermen to erect new water-works at Tyburn for the purpose\r\nof providing the city with a better supply.(60) In 1593 Beavis Bulmer,\r\nanother foreigner (to judge from his name), obtained a lease for 500 years\r\npermitting him to set up an engine at Broken Wharf for the purpose of\r\nsupplying water to the inhabitants of the city. The Court of Aldermen\r\ngranted him the use of the green-yard at Leadenhall for putting together\r\nhis engine, whilst the court of Common Council advanced him the sum of\r\n£1,000 on easy terms.(61) Soon after the granting of Bulmer’s lease the\r\nCommon Council conceded to Henry Shaw a right to convey water from Fogwell\r\npond, Smithfield, and to supply it to anyone willing to pay him for it,\r\nfor a similar term of 500 years.(62)\r\n\r\n(M19)\r\n\r\nAt length a scheme was started at the opening of the seventeenth century\r\nwhich not only proved itself equal to the task of supplying the\r\never-increasing population of London with an adequate supply of water, but\r\nwas destined in after years to render its undertakers rich \"beyond the\r\ndreams of avarice.\" The New River Company, the original shares of which\r\nare of almost fabulous value at the present day, had its commencement in\r\nan Act of Parliament (3 James I, c. 18) which empowered the mayor,\r\ncommonalty and citizens of London and their successors at any time to make\r\nan open trench(63) for the purpose of bringing a fresh stream of running\r\nwater to the north parts of the city from springs at Chadwell and Amwell,\r\nco. Herts. Whilst showing themselves ready and anxious to render the city\r\nmore healthy and less subject to epidemics by cleansing the city’s ditches\r\nof all filth and draining Finsbury and the Moorfields,(64) the civic\r\nauthorities were appalled at the enormity of their own proposals, and\r\nhesitated to carry out what at that time appeared to be an engineering\r\ntask of stupendous difficulty. Three years elapsed and nothing was done.\r\nOffers were made by various individuals to execute the work for them, but\r\nthese were declined.(65) At length, on the 28th March, 1609, Hugh\r\nMiddleton, a goldsmith of London, but of Welsh extraction, declared\r\nhimself ready to undertake the work and to complete it within four years.\r\nHis offer was accepted, and an agreement was drawn up and executed on the\r\n21st April.(66)\r\n\r\n(M20)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the lords of the council having been desired by the lord\r\nmayor to instruct the Justices of the Peace of Hertfordshire and Middlesex\r\nto assist Middleton and his men in carrying out their work,(67) the\r\nundertaking met with great opposition. Among the various objections raised\r\nto the New River scheme was one to the effect that the municipal\r\nauthorities had done nothing in the business themselves, but had by Act of\r\nCommon Council irrevocably conveyed their whole interest in fee simple to\r\nMiddleton, who was carrying out the work \"for his own private benefit.\" To\r\nthis objection answer was made that if the mayor and citizens would not\r\nadventure upon so uncertain a work Middleton deserved the greater\r\ncommendation in adventuring his money and labour for the good of the city,\r\nand if the city was benefited and the country not prejudiced Middleton\r\ndeserved all that he gained.(68) A bill was introduced into parliament to\r\nrepeal the Acts authorising the construction of the New River, and a\r\ncommittee appointed (20 June, 1610) to survey the damages caused or likely\r\nto be caused by the work,(69) and report thereon to the House. \"Much ado\r\nthere is also in the House,\" wrote a contemporary to his friend,(70)\r\n\"about the work undertaken and far advanced already by Middleton, of the\r\ncutting of a river and bringing it to London from ten or twelve miles off,\r\nthrough the grounds of many men who, for their particular interest, do\r\nstrongly oppose themselves to it, and are like (as ’tis said) to overthrow\r\nit all.\" The bill was opposed by the City. A deputation consisting of two\r\naldermen, the Town Clerk and the City Remembrancer was appointed (25 May,\r\n1610) to wait upon Sir John Herbert, one of the principal Secretaries of\r\nState, Sir Julius Cæsar, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and other\r\ninfluential members of parliament, for the purpose of entreating them to\r\nuse their efforts to prevent the repeal of the statutes on the ground that\r\nthe stream of fresh water which would thereby be brought to the north\r\nparts of the city would tend to the preservation of health; that the work\r\nhad already been carried ten miles, and that Middleton had already\r\nexpended more than £3,000 in carrying it out.(71)\r\n\r\n(M21)\r\n\r\nMiddleton was eventually allowed to proceed with his work, but the delay\r\nthat had taken place made it necessary for him to apply to the Common\r\nCouncil for an extension of time within which to complete it. The City\r\nreadily consented to grant him an extension of five years (27 Feb.,\r\n1611).(72) No application for pecuniary assistance however appears to have\r\nbeen made to the City at this or any other time whilst the work was in\r\nprogress by Middleton, although he lacked funds and was compelled in the\r\nfollowing year to seek the assistance of James himself. The king was\r\nfamiliar with Middleton and his undertaking, for the New River was carried\r\npast his own hunting-lodge of Theobalds. In May (1612) he agreed to pay\r\nhalf the cost of the whole work on condition that Middleton would convey\r\nto him one-half of the property. Middleton could not do otherwise than\r\naccept the king’s offer, and in the following August executed a deed\r\nconveying thirty-six shares to James.(73)\r\n\r\n(M22)\r\n\r\nWith royalty at his back Middleton was enabled to complete his\r\nundertaking, and the New River was opened with befitting ceremony on the\r\nvery day (29 Sept., 1613) that Thomas,(74) his elder brother, was elected\r\nto the mayoralty chair for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n(M23)\r\n\r\nEven then the whole enterprise might have failed had not pressure been\r\nbrought to bear to make the inhabitants of the city use the New River\r\nwater to the exclusion of other supplies. In 1616, three years after the\r\nNew River had been opened, the lords of the council wrote (23 Dec.) to the\r\nmayor and aldermen informing them that it was the king’s wish that,\r\ninasmuch as few persons used the new supply, the city authorities should\r\nsee that all such houses as could conveniently use it should be made to\r\nuse it, for it was not to be supposed, said they, that two Acts of\r\nParliament and an Act of Common Council affecting the health and safety of\r\nthe city should be passed to no other purpose than to injure those who\r\nundertook so useful a work on the part of the city.(75) So again, in the\r\nfollowing year (1617), when the brewers of London wished to erect\r\nwaterworks on their own account at Dowgate, they were stopped by order of\r\nthe Privy Council, and told to take their water from the New River, which\r\nhad been made at great expense, \"was of great consequence to his majesty’s\r\nservice, and deserved all due encouragement.\"(76) Even the civic\r\nauthorities themselves were forbidden (11 April, 1634) to improve the\r\nsupply from Tyburn, on which they had already expended much money, for\r\nfear of injuring the interests of the shareholders of the New River\r\nCompany,(77) who had but recently received their first dividend.(78)\r\n\r\n(M24)\r\n\r\nSoon after the completion of the New River, Middleton applied to the City\r\nfor a loan. The whole of his own capital had been sunk in his vast\r\nundertaking, and he required an advance of £3,000. The loan was granted (8\r\nSept., 1614) for three years at six per cent., security being given by his\r\nbrother Thomas, the lord mayor, Robert, another brother, and Robert\r\nBateman.(79)\r\n\r\n(M25)\r\n\r\nIn 1622 (19 Oct.) James conferred on Middleton a baronetcy—a new\r\nhereditary title recently established for supplying the king with money to\r\nput down the Irish rebellion.(80) Middleton, however, appears to have been\r\ntoo poor to pay the sum of £1,000 or so for which the new title was\r\npurchasable; at any rate the money was not exacted.(81) A baronet in the\r\ncity of London (by the way) enjoyed the special privilege of exemption\r\nfrom serving as sheriff. \"It was unfit,\" wrote James to the lord mayor (11\r\nNov., 1613), \"that a gentleman called to the quality of a baronet should\r\nbe afterwards called to be sheriff,\" and he declared that he would have\r\n\"no such precedent.\"(82)\r\n\r\n(M26)\r\n\r\nA year after Middleton had been created a baronet the Court of Aldermen\r\nvoted him (13 Nov., 1623) a gold chain of the value of 200 marks in\r\nrecognition of his services in supplying the city with water, and thereby\r\npreventing the spread of disastrous fires.  Only the night before (12\r\nNov.) \"a very terrible and fearful fire\" had broken out, destroying many\r\nhouses, and among them that of Sir William Cockaine, in Broad Street, and\r\ncausing damage to the extent of £40,000 and more;(83) and the Court of\r\nAldermen, in recording their vote, testified to the great danger which\r\nwould have threatened the city had not a plentiful supply of water, thanks\r\nto Middleton, been at hand.(84) The chain was set with diamonds and had\r\nthe City’s arms by way of pendant. Middleton himself being a goldsmith of\r\nrepute was allowed to supervise the making of it.(85)\r\n\r\n(M27)\r\n\r\nAll this time the City’s loan to Middleton remained outstanding, and\r\nindeed it remained unrepaid at the time of his death in December, 1631, a\r\ncircumstance which shows that the greatest engineer of the age died worse\r\noff than many believe. After considerable hesitation the Court of Aldermen\r\ninstructed the City Solicitor to recover the money by suing on Middleton’s\r\nbond.(86)\r\n\r\n(M28)\r\n\r\nIf other evidence were wanting to show that Middleton died in reduced\r\ncircumstances there is the fact that his widow was compelled, soon after\r\nher husband’s death, to seek satisfaction from the City for losses\r\nsustained by his estate by means of \"many breaches made in the pipes of\r\nwater and otherwise upon occasion of divers great fires.\" After\r\nconsidering the matter for close upon two years the Common Council at\r\nlength agreed (2 Oct., 1634) to raise a sum of £1,000 for her by\r\nassessment on the wards, but hesitated whether to pay the money to Lady\r\nMiddleton for her own use or as executrix only of the will of her late\r\nhusband, \"to be distributed according to the custome of this Citty whereof\r\nhe dyed a Freeman.\" The court added this condition to the gift, viz.: that\r\nthe City should be allowed to set up cocks in connection with the New\r\nRiver pipes in each ward, to be used in cases of fire, in place of cutting\r\nthe pipes, as had been the custom on such occasions.(87) In 1635\r\nMiddleton’s loan remained still owing to the City, and the £1,000 promised\r\nto his widow was not yet collected. On the 12th May Lady Middleton\r\npetitioned the Court of Aldermen to allow the £1,000 to be accepted in\r\npart payment of her late husband’s debt and she would endeavour forthwith\r\nto discharge the remainder. To this the court acceded.(88)\r\n\r\n(M29)\r\n\r\nIn 1726 the New River Company petitioned the Common Council for a direct\r\nconveyance to be made to the company of all the statutory rights and\r\nprivileges the City had originally made over to Middleton. The reason\r\ngiven for this request was that the company found themselves obliged at\r\nthe time to prosecute a number of trespassers, and that it had been\r\nadvised by counsel that in order to get a verdict in the company’s favour\r\nit would have to prove its title, \"through all times and through all the\r\nmean conveyances,\" from the passing of the original Act of Parliament to\r\nthe present time. The company represented that such a proceeding would\r\ninvolve enormous difficulty, but this difficulty could be got over if the\r\nCity would consent to give an immediate grant to the company of all that\r\nthey had formerly conveyed to Middleton, and upon the same terms. The\r\nmatter, urged the company, was one that affected the interests of the\r\nCity, for unless the offenders were punished the water of the New River\r\nwould continue to be intercepted before it reached the city. The petition\r\nwas referred to the City Lands Committee for consideration.(89)\r\n\r\n(M30)\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the City was meditating a transfer of their powers\r\nunder the New River Acts to Middleton, a scheme was being set on foot for\r\ncolonising a vast tract of land in the north of Ireland, which, after the\r\nflight of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel in 1607, was declared to be\r\nconfiscated to the Crown. In October, 1608, commissioners had been\r\nappointed to draw up a plan for the proposed colonisation, or, as it was\r\ncalled, the \"Plantation of Ulster,\" and by the following January (1609)\r\ntheir reports were sent in.(90) The next step was the formulating of\r\norders and conditions to be observed by the undertakers of the plantation,\r\nand by the end of January these were ready, although they do not appear to\r\nhave been published before the following March.(91) The object of\r\npromulgating these orders and conditions was to attract persons to take a\r\nshare in the work of the plantation, not so much with the view of\r\nbenefiting themselves as of doing service to the Crown and commonwealth.\r\nWhatever attraction the scheme as put forth in this Collection of Orders\r\nand Conditions—often referred to in subsequent proceedings as the \"printed\r\nbook\"—may have had for others, it had none for the Londoner.(92) The city\r\nmerchant and trader required to be assured of some substantial benefit to\r\nbe gained by himself before he would embark in any such undertaking, and\r\nin order to give him this assurance he was asked to consider a long list\r\nof \"motives and reasons to induce the City of London to undertake\r\nplantation in the north of Ireland.\"(93)\r\n\r\n(M31)\r\n\r\nIn this document, bearing date the 28th May, 1609, the king offered to\r\nmake over to the city of London the city of Derry and another place near\r\nthe castle of Coleraine with adjacent territory, and with exceptional\r\nadvantages as to custom dues and admiralty jurisdiction. As an inducement\r\nto accept the king’s offer the citizens were assured that the country was\r\nwell watered and suitable for breeding cattle; it grew hemp and flax\r\nbetter than elsewhere; it was well stocked with game and had excellent sea\r\nand river fisheries, and it contained such abundance of provisions as not\r\nonly to supply the plantation, but also assist towards the relief of the\r\nLondon poor. Besides these advantages the city, which was so overcrowded\r\n\"that one tradesman was scarcely able to live by another,\" would have an\r\nopportunity of getting rid of some of its surplus population, and at the\r\nsame time render itself less liable to infectious diseases. If the\r\ncitizens wanted a precedent for what they were now called upon to\r\nundertake, they were invited to look at what Bristol had done for Dublin\r\nin the reign of Henry II. The plantation of Dublin by Bristol, which\r\nreflected \"eternal commendation\" on the latter city, had done much towards\r\ncivilising and securing that part of Ireland, and it was greatly to be\r\nhoped that the precedent so set would now be followed by London, more\r\nespecially as the advantages to be gained were far greater.\r\n\r\n(M32)\r\n\r\nA goodly prospect indeed; but still the enterprise failed to commend\r\nitself to the Londoner. A month went by and nothing was done. At length,\r\non Saturday, the 1st July, the matter was brought direct to the attention\r\nof a special Court of Aldermen and \"divers selected comoners\" of the city\r\nby the lords of the council. Again the citizens were assured that by\r\ntaking a part in the work of the plantation they would not only be doing a\r\nwork acceptable unto God but one which would be at once honourable and\r\nprofitable to themselves.\r\n\r\n(M33)\r\n\r\nThe project was received with favour to the extent that it was resolved to\r\ninvite the livery companies to consider the matter, and to appoint\r\ncommittees to make suggestions to the court in writing by the following\r\nWednesday (5 July),(94) and precepts to the companies were issued\r\naccordingly. The reply sent by the companies appears to have been\r\nconsidered unsatisfactory, for on the following Saturday (8 July) the\r\nmayor issued another precept rebuking them for the attitude taken up by\r\ntheir representatives, who had not, in his opinion, paid sufficient\r\nattention to the matter nor fully realised the motives and reasons which\r\nhad been propounded. He bade them reconsider the matter and send their\r\nrepresentatives to the Guildhall on Friday, 14th July, with \"such reasons\r\nand demands as are fit to be remembered, required or considered of in the\r\nundertaking of so great and honourable an action\" set down in writing.(95)\r\nAccordingly, on the 14th, the committees of the various companies appeared\r\nbefore the Court of Aldermen with their answer in writing, and a\r\ndeputation was nominated to carry their answer to the lords and to hear\r\nanything more that they might have to say on the matter.(96)\r\n\r\nThe lords of the council being angry with the companies for sending in\r\ntheir answer before a conference had been held with them, the Recorder was\r\ninstructed to inform them that the companies had acted under a mistake,\r\nand intended nothing undutiful in what they had done, and a deputation was\r\nagain nominated to confer with their lordships.(97) This was on Tuesday,\r\nthe 18th July.\r\n\r\n(M34)\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the week \"a full and large conference\" took place, and\r\nthe lords of the council so satisfied the representatives of the companies\r\nof the profitable nature of the undertaking that they were encouraged to\r\nbecome adventurers. It was an understood thing between the parties that\r\nthe citizens should send their own representatives over to Ireland to view\r\nthe property, and if the undertaking proved to be otherwise than had been\r\nrepresented, and unprofitable, they were to be at liberty to withdraw from\r\nit altogether. The result of the conference was signified to the masters\r\nand wardens of the several companies on Monday, the 24th July, by precept\r\nof the mayor, who enjoined them to call together their companies on the\r\nfollowing Wednesday, and after explaining the whole matter to them, to\r\nlearn from each individual member what amount he was prepared to\r\ncontribute towards the furtherance of so \"famous a project,\" and to cause\r\nthe same to be entered in a book \"to the intent his majesty may be\r\ninformed of the readiness of this city in a matter of such great\r\nconsequence.\" A note was to be made of any who refused to contribute, and\r\nthose who failed to attend the summons were to be fined. No time was to be\r\nlost, for the lords of the council expected a return of the amount to be\r\ncontributed by the companies by Friday (28 July).(98)\r\n\r\n(M35)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 30th July, a deputation of aldermen and commoners again\r\nwaited on the lords of the council, and received permission to elect four\r\nwise, grave and discreet citizens to cross over to Ireland and view the\r\nproposed plantation. On Tuesday (1 Aug.) the Common Council nominated John\r\nBroad, goldsmith, Hugh Hamersley, haberdasher, Robert Treswell,\r\npainter-stainer, and John Rowley, draper, to be the City’s commissioners\r\nfor the purpose.(99)\r\n\r\n(M36)\r\n\r\nThe lords of the council anticipated the arrival of the City’s agents in\r\nIreland by directing Sir Thomas Philips to accompany them in their\r\ntravels, and by sending instructions to Sir Arthur Chichester, the deputy,\r\nto see that they were well supplied with necessaries and were assisted in\r\nevery way. The latter was more particularly instructed to use great care\r\nin the selection of discreet persons to conduct and accompany them, men\r\nwho from their experience and understanding might be able, \"both by\r\ndiscourse and reason, to controule whatsoever any man shall reporte either\r\nout of ignorance or malice, and to give the undertakors satisfaccon when\r\nthey shalbe mistaken or not well informed of any particular.\"(100) The\r\nconductors were to take care to lead the Londoners by the best roads, and\r\nto lodge them on their journeys where they might, if possible, receive\r\nEnglish entertainment in Englishmen’s houses. The lords of the council at\r\nthe same time forwarded to Sir Arthur Chichester a copy of the \"Project,\"\r\nand desired him to see that those who conducted the City’s agents were\r\n\"well prepared before-hand to confirme and strengthen every part thereof\r\nby demonstracon as they may plainly apprehend and conceive the commodities\r\nto be of good use and profit.\" On the other hand, matters of distaste,\r\nsuch as fear of the Irish, of the soldiers, of cess and such like must not\r\nbe so much as named. These could be set right afterwards and were only\r\nmatters of discipline and order. Lastly, if the Londoners should happen to\r\nexpress a wish respecting anything, \"whether it be the fishing, the\r\nadmirallty, or any other particuler wch may serve for a motyve to enduce\r\nthem,\" the same was to be conceded at once, and no private interests,\r\nwhether of Sir Arthur Chichester himself or any other individual, were to\r\nbe allowed to stand in the way.\r\n\r\nThese instructions were carried out to the letter, and the City’s\r\nrepresentatives, as soon as they set foot in Ireland, were treated right\r\nroyally. Sir John Davys, one of the king’s commissioners engaged in\r\nsurveying the country, wrote home on the 28th August(101): \"The Londoners\r\nare now come, and exceeding welcome to us. Wee all use our best rhetorick\r\nto persuade them to go on wth their plantation, wch will assure the whole\r\nisland to the crowne of England forever. They like and praise the cuntrey\r\nvery much, specially the Banne and the river of Loghfoyle.\" He goes on to\r\nsay that one of the City’s agents had fallen sick, and would have\r\nreturned, but the lord-deputy and the rest had used every means to comfort\r\nand retain him, \"lest this accident shold discourage his fellow\r\ncittizens.\" In other respects, too, they saw the country at its best, for\r\nthey arrived at a time when the Irish were flocking in and making their\r\nsubmission in far better fashion than they had done for years. So pleased\r\nwere they with what they saw that they assured Sir Arthur Chichester that\r\nthe City would certainly undertake the plantation upon the report they\r\nwere about to make. The deputy on his part assured them that if the\r\nLondoners did not undertake the work they would be enemies to themselves.\r\nHe suggested that they should send home to the lord mayor some samples of\r\nthe commodities of the country. The suggestion was adopted, and he\r\nobtained for them some raw hides, tallow, salmon, herrings, eels,\r\npipe-staves, beef and the like at a cheap rate. He also procured them some\r\niron ore and promised to furnish them with samples of lead and\r\ncopper.(102)\r\n\r\n(M37)\r\n\r\nBy November the City’s agents had returned to London. On the 28th they\r\nappeared before the Court of Aldermen and presented their report, together\r\nwith an answer made by Sir Arthur Chichester to certain questions they had\r\nput to him on doubtful points, and also a map or \"plott\" of the country\r\nthey had viewed. The court in the first place authorised the Chamberlain\r\nto re-imburse them the sum of £100 which they had found it necessary to\r\nborrow to supplement the allowance of £300 originally allowed for their\r\nexpenses by the court;(103) and in the next gave orders for all the\r\ndocuments to be enrolled by the Remembrancer \"in a faier booke, wherein\r\nthe letters and other things comytted to his charge and care are recorded\r\nand entred,\" and also in the Journal by the Clerk of the Orphans.(104) The\r\nviewers’ report came before the court of Common Council on the 2nd\r\nDecember, when it was openly read and referred to a committee specially\r\nappointed.(105)\r\n\r\n(M38)\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 15th, the committee were ready with their report. They had\r\nmet five times, and had held long debate and consultation on the various\r\nmatters incident to \"so great a business,\" and on each and all of these\r\nthey had something to say. As to the financial part of the undertaking\r\nthey were of opinion that the Common Council should pass an Act for\r\nraising a sum of £15,000, and no more, upon the members of the wealthier\r\nlivery companies, by poll, the inferior companies being spared. The report\r\nhaving been approved by the court a deputation was appointed to wait upon\r\nthe Privy Council with the City’s answer on the following Sunday (17\r\nDecember).(106)\r\n\r\n(M39)\r\n\r\nWhen the lords of the council came to consider the City’s proposals they\r\nfound much to their liking, but the clause which restricted the amount of\r\nmoney to be furnished by the City to £15,000, and no more, was \"much\r\ndistasted\" by them, seeing that that sum would scarcely suffice to buy up\r\nprivate interests, let alone the work of plantation. The City’s offer in\r\nthis respect was therefore rejected, and the Common Council had therefore\r\nto increase its offer to £20,000.(107)\r\n\r\n(M40)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (8 Jan., 1610) a committee was appointed,\r\nincluding the four commissioners who had viewed the plantation, to confer\r\nwith commissioners appointed by the Privy Council as to the best means of\r\ncarrying out the work. In the meantime the sum of £5,000, or one-fourth\r\npart of the £20,000 required, was to be immediately levied on the\r\nprincipal companies according to their corn assessment.(108) Some of the\r\ncompanies complained of the unfairness of assessing them according to the\r\nexisting corn rate, inasmuch as a great change had taken place since that\r\nrate had been made: \"Divers companies are decayed and others growne to bee\r\nof greater liability, so as particuler men of some companies are now\r\nexceedinglie overcharged and others greatelye favoured.\" It was too late\r\nto make any alteration in the payment of the first two instalments, as the\r\nplantation was to commence in the summer,(109) but a new assessment for\r\ncorn was made in July with the view of making the rate more\r\nequitable.(110)\r\n\r\n(M41)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th January (1610) the committee appointed by the court of Common\r\nCouncil came to terms with the Privy Council, and a special agreement was\r\nsigned by both parties embodying all the essential conditions of the\r\nplantation in twenty-seven articles. A period of seven years was allowed\r\nthe City to make such other reasonable demands as time might show to be\r\nneedful.(111)\r\n\r\n(M42)\r\n\r\nThe articles were read at the Common Council held two days later (30\r\nJan.), when it was decided to form a company in the city of London for the\r\npurpose of carrying out the plantation, the company to consist of a\r\ngovernor, a deputy-governor and twenty-four assistants, of whom the\r\nRecorder of the city was to be one. The governor and five of the\r\nassistants were to be aldermen of the city, the rest commoners.(112) On\r\nthe 4th February the lords of the council informed Sir Arthur Chichester\r\nthat the \"noble and worthy work of the plantation in Ulster undertaken by\r\nthe city\" was concluded, and the articles signed. The city had chosen a\r\ngovernor and a council of assistants for the more orderly disposition of\r\ntheir affairs. They had also elected John Rowley to be their agent, and he\r\nand others would shortly set out for Ireland. The lords commended him to\r\nthe deputy’s care, and he was instructed to see that they were furnished\r\nwith a sufficient number of labourers for felling timber, digging stone\r\nand burning lime. Sir Arthur’s services in forwarding a work which the\r\nking had so much at heart would not go, they assured him, unrewarded.(113)\r\n\r\n(M43)\r\n\r\nThe articles of the plantation had not long been signed before the\r\ngovernment broke faith with the City, and the latter were asked to forego\r\nno less than 2,000 acres of land agreed to be assigned to them. This\r\niniquitous proposal on the part of the king’s commissioners was laid\r\nbefore a special court of Common Council (7 June, 1610) by Alderman\r\nCockaine, the governor of the Irish Society. After long deliberation the\r\ncourt decided to stand upon their rights, and rejected the proposal. Six\r\nweeks later (22 July) they saw fit to change their minds, and they agreed\r\nto surrender the 2,000 acres whilst refusing to accede to other\r\ndemands.(114)\r\n\r\n(M44)\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task the City had undertaken. Great difficulty was\r\nexperienced in getting the companies to pay up their quota of the £20,000\r\nto be raised for the purpose of the plantation. The wardens of the\r\nMercers, the Clothworkers and other companies were committed to prison by\r\norder of the Court of Aldermen for refusing or failing to pay the sums at\r\nwhich their respective companies had been assessed.(115) The masters or\r\nwardens of the companies were not so much to blame as the individual\r\nmembers of the companies who refused to pay. Thus, a sum of £200 due from\r\nSir John Spencer, the rich Clothworker, remained unpaid at his death. It\r\nwas eventually paid by his son-in-law, Lord Compton, after much\r\nsolicitation.(116) Even when the money was got in there was a difficulty\r\nin forwarding it to its destination, so infested was the Irish coast with\r\npirates who lay in wait for the money sent by the City for the works at\r\nColeraine.(117)\r\n\r\n(M45)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (31 Jan., 1611) the livery companies were\r\ncalled upon to certify to the Irish Society, within one week, whether or\r\nno they were willing to accept an allotment of the Irish estate\r\nproportionate to the money by them advanced, and to cultivate and plant\r\nthe same at their own cost and charges, according to the \"printed book\" of\r\nthe plantation, or leave the letting and disposing thereof to the governor\r\nand committees. They were warned that, in any case, they would still have\r\nto contribute towards the charge of building houses and fortifications and\r\nfreeing of tithes.(118) In response to the mayor’s precept eight of the\r\nprincipal companies of the city, viz., the Mercers, Grocers, Drapers,\r\nFishmongers, Goldsmiths, Salters, Ironmongers and Vintners, and ten of the\r\ninferior companies, viz., the Dyers, Pewterers, Founders, Whitebakers,\r\nBroderers, Armourers, Tilers and Bricklayers, Blacksmiths, Weavers and\r\nWoodmongers, signified their willingness to accept a proportionate part of\r\nthe land (27 Feb.). The remainder of the companies preferred to leave the\r\nlands alone, but they were allowed to come in afterwards if they saw\r\nreason to change their mind.(119)\r\n\r\n(M46)\r\n\r\nBy July (1611) nearly the whole of the £20,000 had been expended. The\r\nCommon Council thereupon resolved that a further sum of £10,000 should be\r\nlevied on the companies at the same rate as the last two payments. A day\r\nwas appointed for the companies to send in a written notice whether they\r\nagreed to contribute to this fresh sum or were ready to forfeit the money\r\nthey had already subscribed and lose all their right in the\r\nplantation.(120). £5,000 was to be ready by the 10th August. The remainder\r\nwas not demanded until July, 1612.(121)\r\n\r\n(M47)\r\n\r\nHitherto the agreement between the lords of the council and the citizens\r\nof London had been carried out by one side only. The City had found the\r\nmoney wherewith to carry out the work of the plantation, but as yet not an\r\nacre of land had been assigned. It is not surprising, therefore, that when\r\nthe Grocers’ Company were called upon to contribute their _quota_ to the\r\n£5,000 demanded in July, 1612, they desired the lord mayor not to press\r\nthe matter until the assurance of the lands and other hereditaments for\r\nwhich money had been formerly disbursed should have been obtained from his\r\nmajesty.(122) At length, on the 29th March, 1613, the Irish Society\r\nreceived its charter of incorporation.\r\n\r\n(M48)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great difficulty experienced in getting in the last\r\n£5,000—as much as £3,667 10_s._ being still outstanding in October,\r\n1612(123)—the Common Council found itself under the unpleasant necessity\r\nof asking the companies for another £10,000 within a few weeks of the\r\nincorporation of the Irish Society. Not only had the whole of the £30,000\r\nformerly subscribed been expended, but the Irish Society had borrowed\r\n£3,000 from the Chamber of London.(124) The money was to be raised by the\r\nend of May.\r\n\r\n(M49)\r\n\r\nJames had already begun to show impatience—even before the granting of the\r\ncharter of incorporation to the Irish Society—at the little progress made\r\nin the work of the plantation. At the close of the last year (21 Dec.,\r\n1612) he had himself written to Sir Arthur Chichester directing him to\r\nsend home an account of what the Londoners had done; for, notwithstanding\r\ntheir pretence of great expenditure, there was, so he was informed, little\r\noutward show for it.(125) Fault was found with them, not only for failing\r\nto build houses according to the articles of agreement, but for their\r\nhumane treatment of the \"mere Irish,\" instead of driving them forth to\r\nperish in the narrow districts set apart for them.(126)\r\n\r\n(M50)\r\n\r\nOn Midsummer-day (1613) Sir Henry Montague, the Recorder, and Sir William\r\nCockaine, the governor of the Irish Society, signified to the Common\r\nCouncil that it was the king’s wish that the walls and fortifications of\r\nDerry should be at once taken in hand. The court agreed to lose no time in\r\ncarrying out the king’s wishes, and further resolved to despatch \"some\r\ngreat and worthy magistrate,\" as well as \"some commoner of special\r\ncountenance and credit,\" to take an exact notice, view and account of the\r\nwhole work of the plantation, and of all works done and to be done, and,\r\nin a word, to do all that they deemed necessary for the good of the\r\nplantation. The choice of the court fell upon Alderman George Smithes and\r\nMatthias Springham, a Merchant Taylor.(127)\r\n\r\n(M51)\r\n\r\nThese two proceeded to Ireland, and, having viewed the plantation, sent\r\nhome from Dublin a detailed report of all they had seen and done.(128) The\r\nreport was submitted to the Common Council on the 8th November (1613).\r\nAmong other things they had taken great pains to make an equal division of\r\nthe land as far as was possible into twelve parts, with the view of\r\ndistributing it among the livery companies as proposed, and a \"plott\" of\r\nthe division was laid before the court. But they were of opinion that the\r\ncity of Londonderry and its land of 4,000 acres, and the town of Coleraine\r\nwith its 3,000 acres, its ferries and fisheries, could not be conveniently\r\ndivided, but the rents and profits of them might be divided among the\r\nseveral companies. As to the fortification of Derry, the commissioners had\r\nconsulted ten military experts on the matter and plans had been drafted;\r\nbut it was necessary to gather material before the wall could be\r\ncommenced, and this the commissioners recommended should be taken in hand\r\nat once.\r\n\r\n(M52)\r\n\r\nOn the 17th December lots were publicly drawn to decide the particular\r\nlands which each of the twelve principal companies, combined with several\r\nof the inferior companies in such a way as to make their total\r\ncontributions to amount, as far as might be, to one-twelth of the whole\r\nsum (£40,000) contributed, should hold.(129) The companies at once took\r\npossession of their property so far as they could do so; but livery of\r\nseisin was not and could not be made to them until James had granted (30\r\nSep., 1615), both to the Irish Society and to the companies, a licence in\r\nmortmain. This licence was expressly granted \"to the end that they might\r\nbe the better encouraged and enabled to proceed and finish the same\r\nplantation, and in future times reap some gains and benefits of their\r\ngreat travails and expenses bestowed therein.\"(130) It may be inferred\r\nfrom this that James had little expectation that the undertakers would\r\nreap much gain or profit from their enterprise notwithstanding former\r\nprofessions. For some years to come there was no gain, little or great. No\r\nsooner had the allotment of land to the companies taken place than they\r\nwere called upon to raise a further sum of £5,000,(131) and at the end of\r\nanother twelve months a further sum of £7,500, making in all a sum total\r\nof £52,500 which they had subscribed towards the plantation.(132) It was\r\nnot until 1623 that the profits of the plantation began to exceed the\r\ncosts and the Irish Society was in a position to pay a dividend.(133)\r\n\r\n(M53) (M54)\r\n\r\nIn years gone by, when some of the companies sold their Irish estate,\r\nthere was no question as to their power of alienation or their absolute\r\nright to the proceeds of the sale, but of late years a cry has been raised\r\nthat the companies held their estates in a fiduciary capacity, and that\r\nthey could not legally alienate their Irish property without accounting\r\nfor the proceeds of the sale as public trustees. It had got abroad that\r\nthose companies who had not already parted with their Irish estates—as the\r\nHaberdashers had done as far back as the year 1675, and the Merchant\r\nTaylors, the Goldsmiths and the Vintners, between the years 1728 and\r\n1737—were meditating a sale. In response to the cry thus raised a select\r\nParliamentary Committee was appointed to enquire \"as to the Terms of the\r\nCharters or other Instruments by which their Estates in Ireland were\r\ngranted to the Irish Society and to the London companies, and as to the\r\nTrusts and Obligations (if any) attaching to the Ownership of such\r\nEstates.\" Any trust or obligation in connection with the tenure of these\r\nestates would naturally be comprised within the four corners of the\r\ncharters and instruments mentioned in the order of reference just cited,\r\nbut these the committee practically ignored, on the ground that the task\r\nof pronouncing with decisive authority upon their legal construction could\r\nonly be performed by a judicial tribunal.(134) We have it, however, on the\r\nauthority of so sound a lawyer as the late Sir George Jessel, that the\r\ncompanies are ordinary owners of their Irish estates in fee simple,\r\nsubject only to the reservations expressly contained in the conveyance to\r\nthem.(135)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M55)\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the plantation of Ulster, another and more distant\r\nenterprise of somewhat similar character was being carried out in America;\r\nand to this, as to every great public undertaking, the citizens of London\r\nmust need be called to lend their assistance. A company formed in 1606,\r\nand composed, in part at least, of London merchants, the object of which\r\nwas the colonisation of Virginia, had proved a failure after a hopeless\r\nstruggle for three years. It was therefore determined to reconstruct the\r\ncompany on a different basis and to make an entirely fresh start.\r\n\r\n(M56)\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1609 the company wrote to Sir Humphrey Weld,(136) then\r\nmayor of London, for assistance in financing the undertaking, urging him\r\nat the same time to diminish the risk of pestilence and famine in the city\r\nby removing the surplus population to Virginia. For the sake of\r\nconvenience they purposed to issue no bills of adventure for less than £12\r\n10_s._, but if his lordship were to make any \"ceasement\" (assessment) or\r\nraise subscriptions from the best disposed and most able of the companies,\r\nthe council and company of the plantation would be willing to give bills\r\nof adventure to the masters and wardens for the general use and behoof of\r\neach company, or in the case of subscription by the wards to the alderman\r\nand deputy of each ward for the benefit of the ward. Should the emigrants\r\n\"demaund what may be theire present mayntenaunce, what maye be theire\r\nfuture hopes?\" they might be told that the company was for the present\r\nprepared to offer them \"meate, drinke and clothing, with an howse, orchard\r\nand garden for the meanest family, and a possession of lands to them and\r\ntheir posterity.\" Any alderman of the city subscribing £50 would be\r\nreckoned as an original member of the council of the company, and take\r\nequal share of the profits with the rest; their deputies, too, would be\r\nadmitted to the same privileges on payment of half that sum.\r\n\r\n(M57)\r\n\r\nIn response to a precept no less than fifty-six companies agreed to take\r\nventures in the plantation. The Grocers subscribed the sum of £487 10_s._,\r\nor more than double the amount subscribed by any other company. The\r\nMercers, the Goldsmiths and the Merchant Taylors contributed respectively\r\nthe next highest amount, viz., £200; whilst the Drapers and Fishmongers\r\nsubscribed severally £150, the Stationers £125, the Clothworkers £100, and\r\nthe Salters £50. In addition to these contributions made by the companies\r\nin their corporate capacity other sums were ventured by individual\r\nmembers.(137) Bills of adventure were thereupon given to the several\r\ncompanies for the money subscribed, entitling them to have rateably\r\n\"theire full parte of all such lands, tenements and hereditaments\" as\r\nshould from time to time be recovered, planted and inhabited, as also \"of\r\nall such mines and minerals of gould, silver and other metals or treasure,\r\npearles, precious stones, or any kind of wares or marchaundizes,\r\ncomodities or profitts whatsoever,\" as should be obtained or gotten in the\r\nvoyage.(138)\r\n\r\n(M58)\r\n\r\nWith the assistance thus afforded by the citizens of London the Virginia\r\nCompany had no difficulty in obtaining another charter from the Crown (23\r\nMay, 1609). Among the adventurers to whom the charter was granted, and who\r\nembraced representatives of every rank, profession and occupation, we find\r\nHumphrey Weld, the mayor, whose name immediately follows those of the\r\npeers of the realm who shared in the undertaking, and Nicholas Ferrar,\r\nskinner, who died in 1620, and gave by will \"£300 to the college in\r\nVirginia, to be paid when there shall be ten of the infidels’ children\r\nplaced in it, and in the meantime twenty-four pounds by the yeare to be\r\ndisbursed unto three discreete and godly men in the colonie, which shall\r\nhonestly bring up three of the infidels’ children in Christian religion\r\nand some good course to live by.\"(139)\r\n\r\n(M59)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (15 May) seven vessels with emigrants on board had set\r\nsail from Woolwich. After frequent delays on the south coast of England\r\nthey crossed the Atlantic and reached their destination on the 11th\r\nAugust. Yellow fever had unfortunately broken out on board ship during the\r\nlong voyage, and this, together with the plague, which is generally\r\nbelieved to have been conveyed to Virginia by the fleet, committed great\r\nhavoc among the early emigrants.(140)\r\n\r\n(M60)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before more money was wanted, and again application was\r\nmade to the livery companies. The Mercers declined to make any further\r\nadvance;(141) but with the assistance of the other companies the sum of\r\n£5,000 was raised, which was afterwards increased to £18,000.(142)\r\nNevertheless, in spite of every exertion, the company was in the autumn of\r\n1611 on the very verge of ruin, and something had to be done to prevent\r\nits utter collapse. It was accordingly again re-constructed, its domains\r\nwere made to comprise the Bermudas, or Somers Islands, and a third charter\r\ngranted (12 March, 1612), in which a number of citizens are named as\r\nhaving become adventurers since the last letters patent.(143)\r\n\r\n(M61)\r\n\r\nA special feature of the charter was the authorisation of one or more\r\nlottery or lotteries to be held for the benefit of the company,(144) by\r\nvirtue of which a lottery was soon afterwards opened in London. The chief\r\nprize fell to one Thomas Sharplys, or Sharplisse, a tailor of London, who\r\nwon \"four thousand crowns in fair plate.\"(145) The lucky winner used the\r\nsame motto on this occasion as was used by the Merchant Taylors’ Company\r\nin their venture in the lottery of 1569.(146) The City’s records are\r\nunaccountably silent on the matter of this lottery, but we learn from\r\nother sources that the Grocers’ Company adventured the sum of £62 10_s._\r\nof their common goods and drew a prize of £13 10_s._ An offer being made\r\nto them to accept the prize subject to a rebate of £10, or in lieu thereof\r\n\"a faire rounde salt with a cover of silver all gilt,\" weighing over 44\r\nozs. at 6_s._ 7_d._ per oz., amounting to the sum of £14 19_s._ 1_d._, the\r\ncompany resolved to accept the salt, \"both in respect it would not be so\r\nmuch losse to the company ... and alsoe in regard this company wants\r\nsalts.\" The balance of £1 9_s._ was ordered to be paid out of the common\r\ngoods of the company.(147) Not only the companies but several of the city\r\nparishes had ventures in a small way in the lottery. Thus the vestry of\r\nSt. Mary Colechurch agreed (7 June) to adventure the sum of £6 of the\r\nchurch stock, whereby the church was the gainer of \"twoe spones, price\r\ntwenty shillinge.\"(148) The parish of St. Mary Woolchurch adventured a\r\nless sum, taking only fifty lots at a shilling apiece, in return for which\r\nit got a prize of ten shillings.(149) That the lottery was not taken up in\r\nthe way it was hoped it would be is shown by the fact that just before the\r\ndrawing—which took place in a house at the west end of St. Paul’s, and\r\nlasted from the 29th June till the 20th July—no less than 60,000 blanks\r\nwere taken out, in order to increase the number of chances in favour of\r\nthe adventurers.(150)\r\n\r\n(M62)\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1614) another lottery for the same purpose was set on\r\nfoot. On the 1st April the lords of the council addressed a circular\r\nletter to the city companies,(151) enclosing a copy of a pamphlet by Sir\r\nThomas Smith, entitled \"A declaration of the present estate of the English\r\nin Virginia, with the final resolucon of the Great Lotterye intended for\r\ntheir supply,\" and exhorting them to do their best to make the lottery a\r\nsuccess. The object is there described as a \"worthy and Christian\r\nenterprise, full of honour and profitt to His Majestie and the whole\r\nrealme.\" A copy of this letter was forwarded to the several companies\r\nthrough Sir Thomas Middleton, the mayor,(152) who, as we have already\r\nsaid, was himself a member of the Council of the Virginia Company in 1609.\r\nThe lotteries, however, found but little favour with the companies, who\r\nwere actively engaged at the time in managing their recently acquired\r\nIrish estates, and had but little money to spare. The Merchant Taylors’\r\nCompany contented themselves with voting only £50 out of their common\r\nstock for the lottery, leaving it to individual members to venture further\r\nsums on their own account as each might think fit.(153) The Grocers’\r\nCompany, of which Middleton was a member, voted nothing out of their\r\ncommon stock, but each member was exhorted \"for the general advancement of\r\nChristianity and good of the commonwealth,\" to write with his own hands\r\nhow much he was willing to venture. This was accordingly done (15 April),\r\nthe lord mayor himself setting the example; but as to the result the\r\ncompany’s records fail to give any information.(154)\r\n\r\n(M63)\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the Virginia Company were seriously imperilled by an\r\nill-advised speech made in the House of Commons by the lord mayor\r\ninveighing against the importation of tobacco. The Company was already in\r\ndisgrace with the House, through the indiscretion of Counsel employed to\r\nprosecute a petition on its behalf, and all the members of the Company who\r\nheld seats in the House were desired to withdraw until it should be\r\ndecided what action should be taken in the matter. Eventually peace was\r\nrestored by the offending Counsel coming to the Bar of the House and\r\nmaking a humble submission.(155)\r\n\r\n(M64)\r\n\r\nIn 1618 a scheme was set on foot for taking up vagrant boys and girls that\r\nlay begging in the streets of the city, having neither home nor friends,\r\nand transporting them to Virginia to be there industriously employed. The\r\nscheme came before the Court of Common Council on the 31st July in the\r\nform of a petition from a number of citizens. A committee was at once\r\nappointed to consider the matter, and on the 24th September they brought\r\nin their report.(156) The Virginia Company had agreed to take 100 boys and\r\ngirls between the ages of eight and sixteen, and to educate and bring them\r\nup at the company’s charge. The company were prepared, moreover, to give\r\neach boy and girl fifty acres of land, to each boy as soon as he was\r\ntwenty-four years of age, and to each girl at the age of twenty-one or her\r\nmarriage, whichever should first happen. The charge of fitting out and\r\ntransporting that number was estimated at £500, which sum the court agreed\r\nshould be levied on the inhabitants of the city rateably according as each\r\nwas assessed towards the last poor rate. The young emigrants were soon\r\nafterwards shipped to their new home,(157) and so successfully did the\r\nundertaking turn out that in little over a year another application was\r\nmade to the Common Council (18 Dec., 1619) for another batch of 100\r\nchildren for shipment to the colony in the following spring.(158) It was\r\ndesired that the new emigrants should be twelve years old and upwards,\r\nwith an allowance of £3 apiece for their transportation and 40_s._ apiece\r\nfor their apparel, \"as was formerly graunted.\" The boys would be put out\r\nas apprentices until the age of twenty-one, and the girls likewise until\r\nthe same age or marriage, after which they would be placed as tenants on\r\nthe public lands, and be furnished with houses, stock of corn and cattle\r\nto begin with, and afterwards enjoy the moiety of all increase and profit.\r\nThe Common Council being desirous of forwarding \"soe worthy and pious a\r\nworke\" as the plantation, accepted the company’s proposal, and directed\r\nthat a sum of £500 necessary for the purpose should be levied as on the\r\nprevious occasion.\r\n\r\n(M65)\r\n\r\nSome hitch, however, appears to have occurred in connection with the\r\nshipment of this second consignment of children. The City and the Virginia\r\nCompany had fallen out for some reason or other. In a letter written about\r\nthis time to the lord mayor(159) the company express regret that\r\ndifferences should have arisen between the city and themselves. They\r\nassure his lordship that there was no real foundation for these\r\ndifferences, seeing that they had now ratified all, and more than all than\r\nhad been previously offered and accepted. Everything had been done that\r\nwas necessary for the shipment of the children. The City had collected the\r\nrequisite funds and the children had been provided, whilst the company on\r\nits part had provided a fair ship, and the Privy Council had \"at the\r\ncity’s desire\" granted its warrant.(160) The company therefore trusted\r\nthat the lord mayor and aldermen would proceed to the speedy ending of\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\n(M66)\r\n\r\nThe number of emigrants to Virginia was swelled by the transportation of a\r\nnumber of idle fellows who made it their business to follow the king and\r\nhis court wherever they might happen to be. Early in 1619, when the king\r\nwas at Newmarket, he took occasion to write to Sir Thomas Smith\r\ncomplaining of the annoyance and desired that they might be sent to\r\nVirginia at the next opportunity.(161) Immediately on the receipt of this\r\nletter Sir Thomas Smith wrote to Sir Sebastian Hervey, the mayor,\r\nforwarding at the same time the king’s letter, and asking that the batch\r\nof idle court loafers which had already been despatched from Newmarket to\r\nLondon, as well as those to follow, might be lodged for a time in\r\nBridewell, and there set to work until such time as there should be a\r\nvessel starting for the colony.(162)\r\n\r\n(M67)\r\n\r\nThe Virginia colony—the first of the free colonies of England—soon became\r\nfirmly established, and the City of London can claim to have had no small\r\nshare in the work of its establishment. To the enterprising spirit shown\r\nby the citizens in their efforts to forward the interests of the colony no\r\nbetter testimony is wanted than a thanksgiving sermon(163) preached (18\r\nApril, 1622) in the church of St. Mary-le-Bow by Patrick Copland, chaplain\r\nto the Virginia Company, in commemoration of the safe arrival of a fleet\r\nof nine ships at the close of the previous year. The City of London, the\r\npreacher said, had on two occasions sent over 100 persons to Virginia, and\r\nthe present lord mayor and his brethren the aldermen intended to pursue\r\nthe same course as previous mayors. \"Your cittie,\" he continued,\r\n\"aboundeth in people (and long may it doe so); the plantation in Virginia\r\nis capable enough to receive them. O, take course to ease your cittie, and\r\nto provide well for your people, by sending them over thither, that both\r\nthey of that colony there and they of your owne cittie here may live to\r\nbless your prudent and provident government over them.... Right\r\nWorshipfull, I beseech you ponder (as I know you doe) the forlorne estate\r\nof many of the best members of your citty, and helpe them, O helpe them\r\nout of their misery; what you bestow uppon them in their transportation to\r\nVirginia they will repay it at present with their prayers, and when they\r\nare able with their purses.\"(164)\r\n\r\nA few months after this sermon had been delivered tidings reached England\r\nof a calamity more disastrous than any that had yet befallen the colony. A\r\ntreacherous attack had been made upon the white men by the Indians, which\r\nwas only just saved by timely notice from becoming a general massacre. As\r\nit was, nearly 350 of the settlers were killed. The Common Council lost no\r\ntime in testifying its sympathy with the colony in the great loss it had\r\nsustained, and voted (19 July) a third sum of £500 towards the\r\ntransportation of 100 fresh colonists.(165)\r\n\r\n(M68)\r\n\r\nEver since his accession to the throne of England the financial condition\r\nof James had been going from bad to worse. Besides resorting to antiquated\r\nfeudal exactions,(166) he took to levying impositions on articles of\r\ncommerce. But even these failed to make up the deficiency created in his\r\nexchequer by his wanton extravagance, and in 1610 he was obliged to apply\r\nto parliament. An attempt to make a composition with the king for feudal\r\ndues and to restrict his claim to levy impositions failed, and parliament\r\nwas hastily dissolved.(167)\r\n\r\n(M69)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile James had applied to the City (April, 1610) for a loan of\r\n£100,000. He professed to prefer borrowing the money from the citizens to\r\nraising it by privy seals from his subjects generally, and he promised\r\ninterest at the rate of ten per cent. and security on the customs. The\r\naldermen consented to raise the money \"out of aboundance of love ... but\r\nnot of aboundance of riches or meanes.\" They and the Recorder divided\r\nthemselves into nine several companies or divisions, each bound to furnish\r\none-ninth of the whole loan. The king gave his own bond in £150,000\r\nbesides bonds of the farmer of the customs as security, and the aldermen\r\nset to work to raise the money in as \"secret and discreet manner\" as they\r\ncould.(168) The loan did not go far towards discharging the king’s\r\nliabilities, or those of the late queen, whose debts James had undertaken\r\nto repay. Before the end of the year (1610) certain wealthy merchants of\r\nthe city were summoned to Whitehall to discuss the state of affairs. The\r\nking again wanted money, but inasmuch as he confessed himself unable to do\r\nmore than pay the interest on former loans, leaving the principal to be\r\ndischarged at some future time, they refused to make any further advances,\r\nconsenting only not to press for the repayment of outstanding debts.(169)\r\nPursuant to this agreement the citizens, in April, 1611, when the\r\nrepayment of the loan of £100,000 became due, granted the king another\r\nyear’s respite.(170) A similar concession was made in 1612;(171) and in\r\n1613 the loan was paid off.(172)\r\n\r\n(M70)\r\n\r\nThe king had a right to look for consideration from the city, for in 1608\r\nhe had not only confirmed the liberties and franchises of the citizens by\r\ncharter, but he had extended the civic jurisdiction, and had created all\r\naldermen who had \"passed the chair\" Justices of Oyer and Terminer within\r\nthe city and its liberties. He had, moreover, allowed them to tax\r\nnon-freemen and strangers and to cause them to contribute in like manner\r\nas themselves to all talliages, aids and grants to the king.(173) Two\r\nyears later—soon after his son Henry had been created Prince of Wales and\r\nthe city had done him honour by an aquatic display on the river between\r\nRichmond and London(174) he confirmed (16 June, 1610) the privileges\r\ngranted to them in 1383 by Richard II with the sanction of\r\nparliament.(175)\r\n\r\n(M71)\r\n\r\nBefore the close of 1611 his pecuniary difficulties increased to such an\r\nextent that he was driven to scatter broadcast \"privy seals\" or promissory\r\nnotes for the purpose of raising money. These were not unfrequently placed\r\nin the hands of persons as they came out of church on Sunday evenings, a\r\nproceeding that caused no little scandal.(176)\r\n\r\n(M72)\r\n\r\nThe marriage of his daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, with Frederick, the\r\nElector Palatine, which was soon to follow, not only involved James in\r\nfurther pecuniary difficulties, but eventually plunged him into a\r\ncontinental war. Although the marriage articles were signed in May, 1612,\r\nthe Elector did not arrive in England until October, just at the time when\r\nSir John Swinnerton was about to enter on his duties as mayor for the\r\nensuing year. Special precautions were taken to keep order and guard\r\nagainst accident on lord mayor’s day(177) as soon as it was known that the\r\nElector would attend, and a pageant, entitled _Troja nova triumphans_, was\r\nwritten expressly for the occasion by Thomas Dekker.(178) The Elector\r\nafterwards attended the banquet, and paid a special compliment to the lady\r\nmayoress and her suite.(179) The number of nobles invited was so great\r\nthat there was scarcely room for the customary representatives from the\r\nprincipal livery companies, and none at all for members of the lesser\r\ncompanies. The latter were asked to take their exclusion in no ill part,\r\nas it was a sheer matter of necessity.(180) Before leaving the Elector was\r\npresented on behalf of the city with a bason and ewer weighing 234-3/4\r\nozs., and a \"dansk pott chast and cheseld\" weighing 513-5/8 ozs., and\r\nengraved with the city’s arms and the words _civitas London_, the whole\r\ncosting £262 15_s._ 10_d._(181) There was but one thing to mar the general\r\ngaiety, and that was the illness of the Prince of Wales, whose death a\r\nweek later shed a gloom over the whole of England,(182) and caused the\r\nmarriage of his sister, by whom he was especially beloved, to be postponed\r\nfor a time.(183) The ceremony eventually took place on the 14th February,\r\n1613, amid great pomp and splendour, and in the following April the\r\nyouthful bride and bridegroom left England for Holland.\r\n\r\n(M73)\r\n\r\nIt was currently reported that many Papists and Recusants had taken the\r\nopportunity afforded by the recent court festivities to secrete themselves\r\nin London, and Swinnerton, who had already displayed considerable activity\r\nin searching for them as soon as he became lord mayor,(184) was urged to\r\nredouble his efforts in that direction by a letter from the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury a few days before the marriage of the princess took place.(185)\r\n\r\n(M74)\r\n\r\nThe close of the year witnessed a marriage of a very different character,\r\nviz., the union of the king’s favourite, Carr, Earl of Somerset, with\r\nFrances Howard, the divorced wife of the Earl of Essex. Murderess and\r\nadulteress as she was, she was received at court with every honour; but\r\nwhen the king proposed to sup one night in the city, and to bring his\r\nwhole court with him (including, of course, the newly-married couple), the\r\nlord mayor, Sir Thomas Middleton, demurred, excusing himself on the ground\r\nthat his house was too small.(186) This excuse was of no avail, and the\r\nsupper took place in Merchant Taylors’ Hall, the earl and countess being\r\nspecially invited as well as the entire court. The supper was followed by\r\na masque devised for the occasion by a namesake of the mayor, Thomas\r\nMiddleton, the dramatic poet.(187) The entertainment cost the City nearly\r\n£700,(188) besides the sum of £50 which the Court of Aldermen directed to\r\nbe laid out in a present of plate to Somerset.(189) In acknowledgment of\r\nthe gift the earl presented the mayor and sheriffs with pairs of handsome\r\ngloves.(190)\r\n\r\n(M75)\r\n\r\nFinancial difficulties, which a fresh issue of \"privy seals\" to the\r\naldermen for loans of £200 apiece had done little to alleviate,(191) and\r\nwhich had been aggravated by recent court festivities, at length drove\r\nJames to run the risk of summoning another parliament. He had learnt from\r\nthe wire-pullers of the day—or \"undertakers\" as they were then called—that\r\nhe could depend upon a majority being returned which would be willing to\r\ngrant supplies in return for certain concessions.  In this he was\r\ndeceived. No sooner did constituents discover that pressure was being\r\nbrought to bear in favour of court candidates than they used their best\r\nefforts to frustrate such a manifest design to pack parliament. The\r\nsession was opened on the 5th of April by a speech from the king, in which\r\nhe set forth his financial difficulties, which the extraordinary charge in\r\nconnection with his daughter’s marriage had helped to increase. He would\r\nnot bargain for their money, he said, but would leave it entirely to their\r\nlove what supplies should be granted. In token of his own affection\r\ntowards his subjects he was ready to make certain concessions, and he\r\nentirely disavowed any complicity with the \"strange kind of beasts called\r\nundertakers.\" The new parliament, however, stood out like the last and\r\nrefused to grant supplies until public grievances had been considered. The\r\nresult was that on the 7th June James dissolved what he had fondly hoped\r\nwould have proved to be a \"parliament of love,\" but which from its\r\ninability to pass a single measure came to be nick-named, \"the addled\r\nparliament.\"(192)\r\n\r\n(M76)\r\n\r\nAt his wit’s end for money, James had recourse to benevolences. The\r\nbishops offered him the value of the best piece of plate in their\r\npossession to help him out of his difficulties, and their example induced\r\nmany of the nobles to open their purses. Application was again made to the\r\nCity for a loan of £100,000.(193) This they declined, but made the king a\r\nfree gift of £10,000, one moiety being paid by the City’s Chamber and the\r\nother being furnished by the livery companies.(194)\r\n\r\n(M77)\r\n\r\nIt was now that the City began to resort to the practice of recruiting\r\ntheir Chamber by nominating and electing as sheriffs those who were likely\r\nto prefer paying a fine to serving—a practice which more especially\r\nprevailed during the troublous times of the Stuarts. Nearly a dozen\r\nindividuals were elected one after another to the office at Midsummer of\r\nthis year, and one and all declined. Some, like Sir Arthur Ingram, had\r\nsufficient influence at court to obtain their discharge without fine,\r\nothers paid fines varying in amount, which served to fill the City’s\r\nexchequer.(195)\r\n\r\n(M78)\r\n\r\nAnother reason, however, is given for so many refusals to serve as sheriff\r\njust at this time, and that was that men declined to serve sheriff with\r\nPeter Proby, who had once been a barber.(196)\r\n\r\nThe shrewd ex-barber soon overcame any feeling of antipathy that may have\r\nbeen entertained towards him on entering upon municipal life. In 1616 he\r\nwas sent with Mathias Springham to manage the city’s Irish estate.(197) In\r\n1622 he was elected mayor and in the following year was knighted.\r\n\r\n(M79)\r\n\r\nHitherto it had not been the custom when orders were given for a general\r\nmuster and survey of the armed forces of the realm to include the city’s\r\nforces. The city had been for the most part exempt from such orders,\r\nexcept when the necessities of the times demanded that it should be\r\notherwise. In 1614 the lords of the council thought fit to include the\r\ncity in their order for a general muster, and they wrote (16 Sept.) to the\r\nmayor requiring him to cause \"a generall view\" to be taken of the city’s\r\nforces, and an enrolment made \"of such trayned members as in her late\r\nmajesty’s time were put into companies by the name of the trayned bands.\"\r\nVacancies among the officers and soldiers were to be filled up, armour and\r\nweapons repaired, and the force to be completely equipped and regularly\r\nexercised.(198) The letter having been submitted to the Common Council (21\r\nSept.), it was agreed to raise at once a force of 6,000 men. A tax of a\r\nfifteenth was voted to meet the necessary expenses, and a committee was\r\nappointed to carry out the resolution of the court.(199) On the following\r\nday (22 Sept.) the mayor issued his precept to the alderman of every ward\r\nstating the number of men required from his ward, and particulars of the\r\nkind and quantity of armour his ward was to provide. Appended to the\r\nprecept was a schedule of the prices at which certain manufacturers in the\r\ncity were prepared to sell the necessary weapons.(200) Jerome Heydon,\r\ndescribed as an \"iremonger at the lower end of Cheapeside,\" was ready to\r\nsell corslets, comprising \"brest, backe, gorgett, taces and headpeece,\" at\r\n15_s._; pikes with steel heads at 2_s._ 6_d._; swords, being Turkey\r\nblades, at 7_s._; \"bastard\" muskets at 14_s._; great muskets, with rests,\r\nat 16_s._; a headpiece, lined and stringed, at 2_s._ 6_d._, and a\r\nbandaleer for 1_s._ 6_d._ Henry White and Don Sany Southwell were prepared\r\nto do corslets 6_d._ cheaper, and the same with swords, but their swords\r\nare described as only \"Irish hilts and belts to them.\" Their bastard\r\nmuskets, \"with mouldes,\" could be had for 13_s._, or 1_s._ cheaper than\r\nthose of Jerome Heydon. The Armourers’ Company were ready to supply\r\ncorslets at 15_s._, but for the same \"with pouldrons\" they asked 4_s._\r\nmore. The Cutlers’ Company would furnish \"a very good turky blade and good\r\nopen hilts\" for 6_s._, thus under-selling the private firms.\r\n\r\n(M80)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th May, 1615, the Common Council ordered another fifteenth to be\r\nlevied on the inhabitants of the city \"towards the defrayinge of all maner\r\nof charges to be disbursed in and about the trayninge and musteringe of\r\nmen\";(201) and in the following year the trained bands were divided into\r\nfour regiments, under the command of Sir Thomas Lowe, Sir Thomas\r\nMiddleton, Sir John Watts, and Sir John Swinnerton, and quartered in\r\ndifferent parts of the city for the purpose of putting down riots. For\r\nthese measures the mayor, Sir John Jolles, and the aldermen received the\r\nthanks of the lords of the council.(202)\r\n\r\n(M81)\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the manifest pains taken by civic authorities to\r\ncarry out the wishes of the lords of the council, the latter within a few\r\nweeks again wrote to the mayor,(203) rating him soundly for not having\r\nmade a return of men and arms with which the city was provided, as\r\npreviously directed. Their lordships had been informed that the city was\r\naltogether unprovided with arms and could not furnish the full number of\r\ntrained men with weapons at one and the same time, and that there was\r\nscarce sufficient match and powder in the whole city to serve for one\r\nday’s training. They expressed astonishment that the civic authorities, in\r\nwhom was vested the government of the king’s Chamber, should have proved\r\nso negligent in a matter so important, and directed them to set up\r\nforthwith a magazine of arms for supplying not only the inhabitants of the\r\ncity, but also those of adjacent counties, with military weapons, and to\r\nsupply themselves with a store of gunpowder of not less than 100 lasts, by\r\nthe aid of the city companies, as had been usual in like cases. A\r\ncertificate was also to be returned without delay to their lordships\r\naccording to previous orders. The matter was referred by the Common\r\nCouncil to the \"committees for martial causes\" in the city, with\r\ninstructions to report thereon to the Court of Aldermen.\r\n\r\n(M82)\r\n\r\nAfter the receipt of this letter considerable activity was shown in the\r\nmilitary preparations of the city. A muster and review were ordered to be\r\nheld on the 6th August in Finsbury Fields, and steps were taken to fill up\r\nthe muster-roll of every captain to its full strength of 300 men.(204)\r\n\r\n(M83)\r\n\r\nBy the spring of the next year (1617) the city authorities had succeeded\r\nso far in recovering the confidence and goodwill of the government as to\r\nhave a royal commission of lieutenancy for the city of London granted to\r\nthe mayor, Sir John Leman, eight of the aldermen and Antony Benn, the\r\nRecorder.(205) The commission was to continue during the king’s pleasure,\r\nor until notice of its determination should have been given by the Privy\r\nCouncil under their hands and seals.\r\n\r\n(M84)\r\n\r\nMatters remained on this footing for a year, when the lords of the council\r\ngave notice (17 May, 1618) of the commission having been withdrawn, and at\r\nthe same time directed the Court of Aldermen to furnish them with a\r\ncertificate of the number of men enrolled in the trained bands (such as\r\nhad long since been ordered but had never yet been sent), and to see that\r\nall previous orders relative to the magazine of arms and the storage of\r\npowder were duly executed. Special directions were given to replace the\r\n\"calliver\" (now become unserviceable) by the musket, and to provide\r\nbullets in addition to powder and match.(206) The letter of the lords was\r\nread at a Common Council held on the 31st July, when committees were\r\nappointed to see to the muster and training of 6,000 men, and to examine\r\nwhat sums of money remained over from the two last fifteenths levied for\r\nsimilar purposes.(207)\r\n\r\n(M85)\r\n\r\nThat James, like his predecessor on the throne, had the increase of the\r\nmaterial prosperity of his subjects very much at heart there is little\r\ndoubt. The measures, however, which he took for increasing that prosperity\r\nwere not always sound. Among these must be reckoned the withdrawal of all\r\nlicences for the exportation of undyed and undressed cloth,(208) the\r\nsuppression of the old company of Merchant Adventurers and the formation\r\nof a new company. For these measures the king was not so much to blame as\r\nWilliam Cockaine, the city alderman who gave him advice on the matter.\r\nThat the advice was bad became soon manifest. The Dutch, who had been the\r\nprincipal buyers of English undyed cloth, retaliated by setting up looms\r\nfor themselves, and threatened to destroy the English cloth trade\r\naltogether. The new company, with Cockaine at its head, proved a complete\r\nfailure, and the old company was restored.(209)\r\n\r\n(M86)\r\n\r\nThe aldermen of the city continued to be pressed for a loan of £100,000,\r\nand after many refusals they at length consented to advance £30,000; but\r\n\"what is that\"—wrote Chamberlain to Carleton—\"among so many who gape and\r\nstarve after it?\"(210)\r\n\r\n(M87)\r\n\r\nDuring the brief career of the new company Cockaine had enjoyed the honour\r\nof entertaining the king at his own house in Broad Street. The cost of the\r\nentertainment, which took place on the 8th June, 1616—including a bason of\r\ngold and £1,000 presented to James and another gift of £500 to Prince\r\nCharles—amounted to more than £3,000, and this (we are told) was\r\ndischarged by the company, whilst his majesty reserved his thanks for\r\nCockaine alone, and at parting conferred upon him the honour of knighthood\r\nwith the civic sword.(211)\r\n\r\n(M88)\r\n\r\nA few months later (Nov., 1616) the city was the scene of another festive\r\ngathering, the occasion being a supper given at Drapers’ Hall to the\r\nrecently created Knights of the Bath. That the wives of city burgesses\r\nwere looked upon as fair game for the courtier to fly at may be seen in\r\nthe works of the dramatists of the day; nor was the merchant’s or\r\ntradesman’s daughter averse to the attention of the court gallant when\r\nkept within reasonable bounds, but on this occasion the exuberant spirits\r\nof the knights, after the long ordeal they had recently gone through,\r\nappear to have overcome them, for, we are told, they were so rude and\r\nunmannerly and carried themselves so insolently divers ways, but specially\r\nin \"putting citizens’ wives to the squeak,\" that the sheriff interfered,\r\nwhereupon they left the hall in high dudgeon without waiting for the\r\nsupper prepared for them.(212)\r\n\r\n(M89)\r\n\r\nPrevious to his departure on a progress to Scotland in the spring of 1617,\r\nthe king addressed a letter to the mayor and Common Council of the City\r\nasking for a loan of £100,000.(213) The necessary occasions of his\r\naffairs, he said, required just then \"the present use of good somes of\r\nmoney,\" by way of a loan, and he could think of no better way of supplying\r\nhimself than by resorting, as his forefathers had done, \"to the love\" of\r\nhis city, and borrowing the money upon the credit of its common bonds. He\r\nreminded them that whenever he had borrowed money the lenders had always\r\nreceived \"royall paiement,\" and he doubted not that they would now act as\r\ntheir own registers and records would show that their predecessors had\r\nacted on similar occasions. On the 22nd January this application was read\r\nto the Common Council, when, after mature deliberation, it was unanimously\r\nagreed—\"without either word or hand to the contrary\"—that one or more\r\nbonds should be made in the name of the Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens\r\nof London, under their common seal, for the repayment of principal,\r\ntogether with interest, to those who were willing to contribute towards\r\nthe loan, upon such counter security as was mentioned in the king’s\r\nletter. The security there mentioned was to be under the great seal and of\r\nsuch a character as the city had been accustomed formerly to receive from\r\nthe king’s predecessors. It appears that James had a few days before\r\nendeavoured to get the citizens to advance the sum of £100,000 on the\r\nsecurity of the crown jewels, but this proposal had met with little\r\nfavour.(214)\r\n\r\n(M90)\r\n\r\nIn March the mayor, John Leman, received the honour of knighthood and was\r\npublicly thanked by the king for the forwardness displayed by the citizens\r\nin the loan, although the money had not at the time been raised.(215)\r\nGreat difficulty was experienced in raising the money. One London\r\nmerchant, John Eldred, whose name frequently occurs in the State Papers in\r\nconnection with advances to the king, endeavoured to get the amount of his\r\nassessment reduced by £400,(216) whilst another, William Cater, kept out\r\nof the way to avoid contributing to the loan.(217) In May there was still\r\na deficiency of £20,000, which called forth a reprimand from the lords of\r\nthe council. The city authorities had been observed to omit or else to\r\nsparingly handle many of the best citizens who were \"nicetest\" to be dealt\r\nwith, and especially intended for the purpose, and to lay the burden of\r\ncontribution upon persons of weak and mean estate, or such as otherwise by\r\ntheir quality and place were not so fit to be called upon for any such\r\noccasion.(218)\r\n\r\n(M91)\r\n\r\nOn his return from Scotland in September the king was met by the mayor and\r\naldermen and a deputation from the livery companies at Knightsbridge and\r\nescorted to Whitehall with the same pomp and solemnity as had been\r\naccustomed to be displayed in attending Queen Elizabeth on her return from\r\na progress.(219) The mayor presented James with a purse of 500 gold\r\npieces,(220) and the king conferred the honour of knighthood upon Antony\r\nBenn, the Recorder, and Ralph Freeman.(221)\r\n\r\n(M92)\r\n\r\nIn the following March (17th) the mayor and aldermen were informed by\r\nletter from the lords of the council of the king’s inability to repay the\r\nlast loan according to promise, and were asked to allow a twelvemonth’s\r\ngrace.(222)\r\n\r\n(M93)\r\n\r\nThe king’s financial position had become by this time reduced to so low a\r\nstate that when his consort died in March of the following year (1619)\r\nthere was some probability that her funeral would have to be delayed for\r\nwant of money to buy \"the blacks.\"(223) As it was the funeral did not take\r\nplace until the 13th May, but this may have been owing to the king himself\r\nhaving been ill.(224) The mayor, Sebastian Hervey, and the aldermen\r\nreceived (after some delay) the customary allowance of mourning\r\ncloth,(225) but for some reason or other they were not invited to attend\r\nthe funeral.\r\n\r\n(M94)\r\n\r\nJames had recently been worrying the mayor into consenting to a match\r\nbetween his daughter, a girl barely fourteen years of age, and Christopher\r\nVilliers, son of the Countess of Buckingham. The match was \"so much\r\nagainst the old man’s stomach,\" wrote a contemporary,(226) \"as the conceit\r\nthereof hath brought him very near his grave already.\" He had publicly\r\ndeclared that he would rather that he and his daughter were both dead than\r\nthat he should give his consent. The king pressed matters so far as one\r\nday to send for the mayor, his wife and daughter, from dinner at Merchant\r\nTaylors’ Hall, in order to urge upon them the marriage.(227) It was\r\nperhaps owing to the strained relations existing at the time between the\r\nking and the mayor that the civic authorities were not invited to the\r\nfuneral of the queen. If that be the case James soon saw that he had made\r\na mistake, and in order \"to please them\" caused a memorial service to be\r\nheld on Trinity Sunday at Paul’s Cross, which was attended by the aldermen\r\nand other officers of the city, but not by Hervey, the mayor, who—\"wilful\r\nand dogged\" as he may have been—had become seriously ill from the king’s\r\nimportunity and was unable to be present.(228)\r\n\r\n(M95)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a revolution had taken place on the continent, the effects\r\nof which were felt in London and the kingdom. In 1618 the Protestant\r\nnobility of Bohemia deposed their king, the Emperor Matthias, and in the\r\nfollowing year they deposed his successor, Ferdinand, after\r\nunceremoniously flinging his deputies out of the window, and offered the\r\ncrown to Frederick, the Elector Palatine, who had married James’s\r\ndaughter, the Princess Elizabeth. The Elector asked his father-in-law’s\r\nadvice before accepting the proffered crown, but James shilly-shallied so\r\nlong that Frederick could wait no longer, and he signified his acceptance\r\n(26 Aug., 1619). James was urged to lend assistance to his son-in-law\r\nagainst the deposed Ferdinand, who had become by election the Emperor\r\nFerdinand II, but to every appeal he turned a deaf ear.\r\n\r\n(M96)\r\n\r\nFailing in this quarter the Elector turned to the city of London. On the\r\n26th November, 1619, he wrote from Nuremburg to the lord mayor, saying he\r\nwas about to send the Baron Dohna to explain how matters stood in Bohemia,\r\nand desiring his lordship to lend a favourable ear to what the baron would\r\ntell him.(229) This letter the mayor forwarded to James, intimating that\r\neither himself or the Recorder would wait upon him when convenient.(230)\r\nTime went on, and the king made no sign until in February of the next year\r\n(1620) secretary Calvert wrote to the mayor(231) on the king’s behalf to\r\nthe effect that, his majesty having understood that a request had been\r\nmade to the City for a loan, he could take no steps in the matter until he\r\nwas fully satisfied of the justice of the cause; that at present he knew\r\nnothing and was \"a mere straunger to the business.\"(232) In the meantime,\r\nif the mayor desired to say anything more to his majesty, he might meet\r\nthe king at Theobalds, or later on in London.\r\n\r\n(M97) (M98)\r\n\r\nA fortnight passed, and then Baron Dohna wrote (28 Feb.) to the mayor\r\nmaking a formal application for a loan of £100,000 for the defence of the\r\nPalatinate, and expressing a hope for a speedy and favourable reply.(233)\r\nThe king was asked to back up the baron’s request, but declined.(234) A\r\nmonth later the city authorities again consulted the king as to his\r\nwishes. The reply given was characteristic of the caution displayed by\r\nJames throughout: \"I will neither command you nor entreat you,\" was the\r\nanswer they got, \"but if you do anything for my son-in-law I shall take it\r\nkindly.\"(235) The citizens were not in the least averse to advancing money\r\nfor the cause of Bohemia, if only they could get some assurance from the\r\nking or council that they would not afterwards be blamed for it.(236)\r\nHaving got as much as ever they were likely to get by way of this\r\nassurance, they signified their assent to Dohna’s request, and received in\r\nreturn a letter of thanks (25 Mar.) from Frederick himself.(237)\r\n\r\nPrecept was issued (29 March) by the mayor, not, as was usually the custom\r\nin similar cases, to the livery companies, but to the aldermen of each\r\nward.(238) Moreover, subscriptions to the loan were to be purely\r\nvoluntary. Each alderman was especially directed not to \"compell any wch\r\nare unwilling, nor refuse to accept the smaller summes of such as out of\r\ntheir loves doe offer the same.\"(239)\r\n\r\n(M99)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 26th March (1620), the king paid a State visit to St.\r\nPaul’s, attended by the mayor and aldermen and the members of the civic\r\ncompanies in their best liveries.(240) The object of the visit, which had\r\ngiven rise to much surmise—the Catholics believing that it was to hear a\r\nsermon in favour of the proposed Spanish match, whilst the Protestants\r\nhoped it was for the purpose of exhorting the people to contribute to the\r\nfund that was being raised for the king of Bohemia—was to hasten the\r\nsubscriptions for rebuilding the cathedral church,(241) which for sixty\r\nyears had been in a more or less ruinous state, in spite of all efforts to\r\nrestore it. On this occasion the king was presented with a sum of 1,000\r\nmarks and Prince Charles with half that amount.(242)\r\n\r\n(M100)\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year (1620) news reached England that a Spanish\r\narmy had entered Bohemia and driven Frederick out of the country after a\r\ncrushing defeat, and at last James was roused to action. A parliament was\r\nsummoned to meet in January (1621)(243) in order to vote supplies for war.\r\nIn the meantime he endeavoured to raise what he could by way of a\r\nvoluntary gift from the nobility and wealthier class of his subjects, to\r\nwhom circulars from the council were sent urging them to assist.(244)\r\n\r\n(M101)\r\n\r\nThe council also applied (31 Oct.) to the city of London,(245) but more\r\nthan a month elapsed before a reply was sent,(246) and it was not until\r\nthe 14th December that the mayor issued his precept to the livery\r\ncompanies to raise among themselves the several sums of money they had\r\nbeen accustomed to pay on former occasions,(247) such sums being in\r\naccordance with a corn assessment made in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas\r\nMiddleton (1613-14). Several of the companies, and notably the Merchant\r\nTaylors (the largest contributors), objected to this mode of imposing\r\nassessment upon them according to the corn rate as working an injustice.\r\nThe Court of Aldermen therefore agreed to again revise the corn rate.(248)\r\nA dispute also arose as to the amounts to be paid by the Apothecaries and\r\nthe Grocers respectively, the former having recently severed themselves\r\nfrom the latter and become incorporated as a separate company.(249) After\r\nall said and done the companies could not be prevailed upon to contribute\r\nmore than £5,000, which sum was raised to 10,000 marks, or £6,666 13_s._\r\n4_d._, by contribution from the City’s Chamber.(250) We have it on record\r\nthat the lords of the council never intended that any call should be made\r\non the companies at this juncture, but that only the mayor and aldermen\r\nand those who had fined either for sheriff or alderman should contribute\r\ntowards the defence of the Palatinate as they themselves had done.(251)\r\nNor would the companies have been called upon on this occasion (any more\r\nthan they appear to have been called upon on the last) had the collection\r\nof money from the various parishes risen to the proportion required. It\r\nwas only when a deficiency was discovered that the mayor and aldermen had\r\nresort to the expedient of raising £5,000 from the companies, each company\r\npaying rateably according to their usual rates for other assessments.(252)\r\n\r\n(M102)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament at length met (after several prorogations) on the 30th\r\nJanuary (1621) James opened the session with a long speech, in which a\r\nrequest for supplies held a prominent place. The Commons, however, without\r\nshowing any disposition to be captious, were in no hurry to grant war\r\nsupplies until they were assured that there was to be a war. The king had\r\ntherefore to be content with a grant of no more than two subsidies, or\r\nabout £160,000. He had recently issued a proclamation (24 Dec., 1620)\r\nforbidding his subjects to speak on affairs of State.(253) If the nation\r\nin general was to be thus bridled the Commons showed their determination,\r\nwhilst criticising the king’s administration, to vindicate at least their\r\nown right to liberty of speech.\r\n\r\n(M103)\r\n\r\nThere was also a class of Londoner not easily silenced. A royal\r\nproclamation had no terrors for the London apprentice; and when they\r\nrecognised an old enemy in the person of the Spanish ambassador(254) in\r\nthe street, they were accustomed to give tongue and, if thwarted, to\r\nresort to blows. It happened one day that as Gondomar was being carried\r\ndown Fenchurch Street, an apprentice standing idly with one or two of his\r\nfellows at his master’s door cried out, \"There goeth the devil in a\r\ndung-cart.\" This remark raised a laugh which so stung one of the\r\nambassador’s servants that he turned sharply on the offender. \"Sir,\" said\r\nhe, \"you shall see Bridewell ere long for your mirth.\" \"What,\" cried one\r\nof his fellows, \"shall we go to Bridewell for such a dog as thou?\" and\r\nforthwith brought him to the ground with a box on the ear. The ambassador\r\nlaid a complaint before the mayor, who somewhat reluctantly sentenced the\r\noffending apprentices to be whipt at the cart’s tail. That any of their\r\nnumber should be flogged for insulting a Spaniard, even though he were the\r\nSpanish king’s ambassador, was intolerable to the minds of the apprentices\r\nof London, who were known for their staunchness to one another. The report\r\nspread like wildfire, and soon a body of nearly 300 apprentices had\r\nassembled at Temple Bar, where they rescued their comrades and beat the\r\ncity marshals. Again Gondomar complained to the mayor, who, sympathising\r\nat heart with the delinquents, testily replied that it was not to the\r\nSpanish ambassador that he had to give an account of the government of the\r\ncity. The matter having reached the king’s ears at Theobalds, he suddenly\r\nappeared at the Guildhall and threatened to place a garrison in the city\r\nand to deprive the citizens of their charter if matters were not mended.\r\nHis anger was with difficulty appeased by the Recorder, and he at last\r\ncontented himself with privately admonishing the aldermen to see the young\r\nfellows punished. The end of the affair was tragical enough. The original\r\nsentence was carried out, with the result that one of the apprentices\r\nunhappily died.(255)\r\n\r\nSuch is the account of the disturbance as found in contemporary letters.\r\nFrom the City’s records(256) we learn a few additional particulars. On\r\nWednesday, the 4th April, a special Court of Aldermen sat, at which a\r\nletter from the lords of the council was read signifying the king’s\r\npleasure that David Sampson, an apprentice to a tailor, should be very\r\nsharply whipt through the city from Aldgate to Fleet Street by the common\r\nexecutioner for an insult offered the Spanish ambassador on the preceding\r\nMonday (2 April). A good guard was also to be appointed for the purpose,\r\nand instructions were given to the Recorder and some of the aldermen to\r\ndiscover if possible the rest of the offenders. The result of their\r\nefforts in this direction was the apprehension of Robert Michell, an\r\napprentice to a haberdasher, and Richard Taylor, an apprentice to a\r\nbricklayer, the former of whom was accused of threatening to throw a loaf\r\nat the \"choppes\" of the ambassador’s servant, and the latter with having\r\nactually discharged a brickbat with effect at one of his suite. Sampson’s\r\nwhipping, which ought to have taken place in the forenoon of Wednesday,\r\nwas thereupon postponed until the afternoon, when all three offenders were\r\npunished together, in the presence of a good guard. On the following\r\nmorning (5 April) another special Court of Aldermen sat at the mayor’s own\r\nhouse, when it was ordered that Daniel Ray, a drayman, who had been\r\nconvicted of holding up his hand at the Spanish ambassador as he passed\r\nthrough Gracechurch Street, grinning at him and calling him \"Spanish\r\ndogge\" just before Michell and Taylor committed their excesses, should\r\nalso be whipt between eight and nine o’clock the next morning. In order to\r\nprevent a repetition of the disturbance which had occurred the previous\r\nday, the mayor issued his precept(257)(5 April) for a substantial double\r\nwatch to be kept for twenty-four hours from nine o’clock in the evening of\r\nthe 5th April. The inhabitants were further ordered to stand at their\r\ndoors, halberd in hand, and ready for any emergency, whilst they were to\r\nsee that their apprentices, children and servants behaved well towards all\r\nambassadors and strangers as well as his majesty’s subjects.\r\n\r\nBy this time news of the confusion and rescue attending the earlier\r\npunishment had reached the king’s ears. Ray’s whipping was put off. The\r\nRecorder informed the Court of Aldermen, specially summoned to the mayor’s\r\nhouse on Friday afternoon (6 April), that the king purposed coming that\r\nday to the Guildhall in person between two and three o’clock, when the\r\nmayor and aldermen were commanded to attend, and until then the execution\r\nof Ray’s punishment was not to be carried out. At the appointed hour James\r\narrived with divers lords of the council. He is recorded(258) as having\r\nmade an excellent oration to the mayor and aldermen, \"much reprovinge\r\ntheir misgovernment, and the ill carriage of the rude sorte of people, and\r\nthe affront lately offered to justice in that rescue.\" He commanded them\r\nat their peril to see that no manner of affront occurred in the punishment\r\nof Daniel Ray, but that he should after his whipping be quietly conveyed\r\nto prison until his majesty’s pleasure should be further known. Three days\r\nlater (9 April) Ray, Sampson and Taylor (Michell appears to have been the\r\none who succumbed to ill treatment) appeared before a special Court of\r\nAldermen and, acknowledging their offences, asked pardon of God and the\r\nking. Thereupon the Recorder signified to them the king’s remission of\r\nfurther punishment, and they were discharged out of prison.(259)\r\n\r\n(M104)\r\n\r\nWhilst the Commons were chafing under the restriction which forbade them\r\nmentioning even the name of the Palatinate, an elderly individual named\r\nFloyd was imprisoned in the Fleet for displaying joy at the news of the\r\nbattle of Prague. \"Goodman Palsgrave and Goodwife Palsgrave,\" he had been\r\nheard to say, \"were now turned out of doors.\" All sorts of punishment was\r\nsuggested by members of the House, which after all had no jurisdiction in\r\nthe matter whatever; and after a kind of three-cornered duel between the\r\nking, the Lords and Commons, Floyd was made to expiate his crime by riding\r\nfrom Fleet Bridge to the Standard in Cheapside, his face towards the\r\nhorse’s tail, and having a paper in his hat with the words, \"For using\r\nignominious and malicious words against the Prince and Princess Palatine,\r\nthe king’s only daughter and children.\" After standing there for two hours\r\nhe was branded on his forehead with the letter K and conveyed to the\r\nFleet.(260)\r\n\r\n(M105)\r\n\r\nThe Commons having voted supplies, albeit small and inadequate for the\r\nking’s wants, James lost no time in asking the citizens for an advance on\r\nthe amount of subsidy due from them. On the 27th March (1621) the lord\r\ntreasurer wrote very urgently on the matter. \"I pray you,\" he added by way\r\nof postscript, \"make noe stickinge hereatt; you shall bee sure to bee paid\r\natt the tyme named.\"(261) If the citizens could not advance the whole sum\r\nat short notice, they were asked to give credit for the rest to the\r\nmerchant whom Baron Dohna should appoint for transferring the money to the\r\nPalatinate by bills of exchange. It was all to no purpose. The mayor and\r\naldermen were tired of the repeated calls upon their purse, and returned\r\nanswer by word of mouth of the Common Sergeant and the Remembrancer that\r\nthe City hoped rather to receive part of the money already lent than to\r\n\"runne in further.\"(262)\r\n\r\n(M106)\r\n\r\nThe failure of negotiations for a Spanish match, and the return of Prince\r\nCharles after his romantic expedition in 1623 without bringing the Infanta\r\nwith him, was a source of great satisfaction both to the City and the\r\nnation. The following story of the day serves to illustrate the feeling\r\nprevalent at the time relative to the Spanish match. The bishop of London\r\nhad given orders to the clergy, pursuant to instructions he had himself\r\nreceived from James, not to \"prejudicate the prince’s journey by their\r\nprayers,\" but only to pray to God to bring him safely home again and no\r\nmore. A clergyman, who must have been a bit of a wag (for it is difficult\r\nto explain his conduct otherwise), is said to have literally carried out\r\nhis bishop’s orders, and to have prayed publicly \"That God would return\r\nour noble prince home again to us and no more.\"(263) When it became known\r\nthat the prince had arrived safely at Madrid, bonfires were lighted and\r\nbells rung; but the Londoners were but half-hearted in expressing their\r\njoy, and would probably have made no display had they not received orders\r\nfrom the lords of the council.(264) It was otherwise when the prince\r\nreturned—and without the Infanta. As soon as news reached the mayor that\r\nCharles had arrived at Guildford he issued his precept (6 Oct.) for bells\r\nto be rung and bonfires to be lighted,(265) and right gladly were his\r\norders carried out. \"I have not heard of more demonstrations of public joy\r\nthan were here and everywhere, from the highest to the lowest,\" wrote\r\nChamberlain from London;(266) \"such spreading of tables in the streets\r\nwith all manner of provisions, setting out whole hogsheads of wine and\r\nbutts of sack, but specially such numbers of bonfires, both here and all\r\nalong as he [the prince] went, the marks whereof we found by the way two\r\ndays afterwards, is almost incredible.\"\r\n\r\n(M107)\r\n\r\nThe king’s foreign policy having proved a total failure, there was no\r\nother course open for him but to summon a parliament. A parliament was\r\naccordingly summoned to meet in February of the next year (1624). The king\r\nand Commons soon found themselves in opposition, the former advocating a\r\nwar in Germany for the defence of the Palatinate, the latter a war against\r\nSpain. At length a compromise was effected, the Commons agreeing to vote\r\nsupplies on the understanding that James broke off all negotiations with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n(M108)\r\n\r\nNegotiations with Spain were thereupon broken off, but not before James\r\nhad found another ally in France. Before parliament was prorogued (29 May)\r\nJames had sounded Louis XIII as to a marriage between Charles and\r\nHenrietta Maria, the French king’s sister. In April Count Mansfeld, a\r\nGerman adventurer who had offered his services to France, arrived in\r\nEngland and was hospitably entertained. The object of his visit was to see\r\nthe extent of the preparations that were being made for war.\r\n\r\n(M109)\r\n\r\nStrenuous efforts to raise money in the city were made. Chamberlain,\r\nwriting to Carleton from London (1 July), tells his friend, \"Here is great\r\nexpedition used to raise money, and make ready payment; insomuch that\r\nsince Monday sevennight, the council have sat thrice at Guildhall about\r\nthe subsidies.\" The lord keeper, in his endeavours to persuade the\r\ncitizens to loosen their purse-strings, went so far as to declare that\r\nanyone disguising his wealth was committing the sin against the Holy\r\nGhost, and was as Ananias and Saphira! So great was the general decay,\r\nboth in the city and the country, that there was some talk of putting in\r\nforce the penal laws against recusants, notwithstanding the negotiations\r\nthat were going on for a French marriage, in order to make up the expected\r\ndeficit.(267) The civic authorities were again pressing the king for the\r\nrepayment of the loan (£100,000) made in 1617. Time had wrought\r\nalterations in the condition of the lenders; some were dead and their\r\nwidows and orphans were crying out for repayment; some were decayed and\r\nimprisoned, and others likely to undergo the same calamity if steps were\r\nnot taken for their speedy relief. They complained that the city’s seal,\r\nwhich had by his majesty’s command been given as security to the tenders,\r\nsuffered as never it had done before, and several suits had been commenced\r\nagainst the Chamber of London in the courts at Westminster, to which they\r\nknew not how to give satisfactory answer. They therefore prayed him to\r\ngive order for such payment to be made to them as might give relief to the\r\ndistressed and comfort to them all. The result was that the king directed\r\n(July, 1624) his two principal secretaries and the chancellor of the\r\nexchequer to devise means for satisfying the debt.(268)\r\n\r\n(M110)\r\n\r\nIn September Mansfield was again in England asking for men and money for\r\nthe recovery of the Palatinate, in which he had been assured of the\r\nco-operation of France. This assurance, however, was only a verbal one,\r\nand nothing would induce Louis to reduce it to writing. James on his part\r\nwas willing to make every concession, provided that the matrimonial\r\nalliance on which he had set his heart could be brought to a happy\r\nconclusion. But as these concessions involved broken pledges, he feared to\r\nface the Commons, and thus the parliament, which should have re-assembled\r\nthis autumn, was further prorogued and never met again until James was no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n(M111)\r\n\r\nIt was to James’s last parliament that the City was indebted for a\r\nstatute,(269) which at length insured it quiet enjoyment of its lands free\r\nfrom that inquisitorial system which had prevailed since 1547, under\r\npretext that it had concealed lands charged with superstitious uses which\r\nhad not been redeemed. In 1618 a commission had been appointed to enquire\r\nas to the waste grounds of the city, on pretence of concealment; but upon\r\nrepresentation being made by the mayor and aldermen that the City had long\r\nenjoyed the lands in question by ancient grant, proceedings had been\r\nstayed.(270) Early in the following year (1619), however, the livery\r\ncompanies were called upon to make a composition to the attorney-general\r\nof £6,000 for arrears of superstitious charges claimed by the king.(271)\r\nOn learning that this money was to be paid to John Murray, of the king’s\r\nbed-chamber (whether to his own use or that of the king is not quite\r\nclear),(272) the mayor and aldermen petitioned the king for a grant of\r\nletters patent, securing both for the City and the companies quiet\r\nenjoyment of their possessions, lest in that \"searching age\" other defects\r\nmight haply be found in their title, to be followed by further\r\ninconveniences. To this the king readily assented, and instructed the\r\nattorney-general to draw up letters patent embracing such matters as the\r\nCity desired.(273) The letters patent were no sooner drawn up by Sir Henry\r\nYelverton, the attorney-general, than he was charged with having\r\nintroduced certain clauses(274) \"corruptly and without warrant.\" The new\r\ncharter was ordered to be brought up. The whole matter formed a subject of\r\ninvestigation for three days in the Star Chamber; Yelverton was dismissed\r\nfrom office, and the City compelled to draw up a formal document\r\ndisclaiming and cancelling the letters patent.(275) At length, on the 23rd\r\nFebruary, 1624, a bill was brought in for the \"general quiet of the\r\nsubjects against all pretences of concealment whatsoever,\" and read the\r\nfirst time; and on the 7th April the bill was passed.(276)\r\n\r\n(M112)\r\n\r\nThe question how to supply Mansfield with men as well as money necessary\r\nfor his undertaking in the absence of parliament was answered by making\r\napplication to the Council of War. On the 29th October orders were issued\r\nfor pressing 12,000 men for the service, and on the same day James himself\r\nwrote to the mayor for 2,000 men to be pressed in the city to assist in\r\nthe recovery of the Palatinate.(277) Two days afterwards (31 Oct.)\r\nfollowed a letter from the lords of the council(278) directing the mayor\r\nto see that the men were of able bodies and years, but not taken out of\r\nthe trained bands, which were to be left entire. They were to be ready by\r\nthe end of November to march to Dover under such officers as the Privy\r\nCouncil might select. As the amount of conduct money, which was usually a\r\nhalf-penny per mile, would vary owing to the difference of localities\r\nwhere the men lived, it was thought best to allow them their ordinary pay\r\nof eightpence per day from the time they were handed over to the officers.\r\nThe mayor was further directed to demand of the collectors of the subsidy\r\nsufficient money for the charge of coats, conduct, armour, etc. On the\r\nlast day of November the lords of the council wrote again informing the\r\nlord mayor of the names of the officers appointed to conduct the men to\r\nDover by the 24th December. He was to see that the men were delivered to\r\nthe officers by roll indented, to be subscribed by himself or his\r\ndeputy-lieutenants on the one part and the captains or officers on the\r\nother part.(279) The service was very unpopular; many deserted, and it was\r\nwith difficulty that the rest could be got to the sea-coast. The city\r\ncontingent was ordered to assemble at Leadenhall on the night of the 18th\r\nDecember or by the next morning at the latest, in order to set out on\r\ntheir march by Monday, the 20th. The full complement of men was to be made\r\nup and the bail of deserters estreated.(280)\r\n\r\n(M113)\r\n\r\nThere was little to hope for from raw levies such as these were,\r\ntransported into a hostile country under the leadership of a foreigner.\r\n\"God speed them well whatsoever they do or wheresoever they go,\" wrote an\r\neye-witness;(281) \"but it is beyond my experience or reading to have such\r\na body of English committed and commanded by a stranger, to say no more.\"\r\nOn their way to Dover the men carried out a system of pillage as if\r\nalready in an enemy’s country; and as soon as they found their pay was not\r\nforthcoming they mutinied.(282) The promises of the French king proved\r\nfallacious and Mansfeld was forbidden to land his forces in France. This\r\nprohibition, however, was little to him, for he had already determined to\r\nact in direct opposition to the wishes of James and to carry his army to\r\nFlushing. Before he set sail from Dover, which he did on the 31st January\r\n(1625), it became necessary to recruit his rapidly diminishing forces by\r\nthe issue of new press warrants. The City was called upon to furnish 1,000\r\nmen in addition to those already supplied.(283) The mayor’s precept on\r\nthis occasion directed the alderman of each ward to seize in their beds or\r\notherwise all able-bodied men, and especially \"all tapsters, ostlers,\r\nchamberlains, vagrants, idle and suspected persons,\" and to convey them to\r\nLeadenhall or Bridewell. Those who had previously been pressed and had\r\nabsconded were to be particularly sought for, whilst those who had in\r\ntheir charge two small children were to be spared.(284) At Flushing, where\r\nMansfeld landed his forces (1 Feb.), the men were soon decimated by want\r\nof food, the inclemency of the season, and sickness, so that, at the time\r\nof James’s death (27 March), out of a force of 12,000 men there were\r\nbarely left 3,000 capable of carrying arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M114)\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the reign of Charles I, like his father’s, was marked\r\nby a recurrence of the plague, which greatly affected the trade of the\r\ncity. Matters were made worse by an application from the Lord High\r\nTreasurer for a loan of £60,000 to the king within a few weeks of Charles\r\nascending the throne. He promised that the money, which was wanted for\r\nfitting out the fleet which the late king was busy preparing at the time\r\nof his death, should be repaid in six months. Interest would be allowed at\r\nthe rate of eight per cent., and Charles would give mortgage security for\r\nrepayment of this as well as of the sum of £100,000 borrowed by\r\nJames.(285) After mature deliberation the Common Council agreed (16 April)\r\nto accede to the Lord Treasurer’s request, and appointed two\r\nrepresentatives of each ward to consult with the mayor and aldermen as to\r\nthe mode of raising the amount, as well as to consider the nature of the\r\nsecurity offered. On the 20th May the Common Council received the\r\ncommittee’s report on the matter.(286) It recommended that the money\r\nshould be borrowed and taken up by twenty aldermen and one hundred\r\ncommoners nominated for the purpose; that five commoners should be\r\nallotted to each alderman, and that they should stand bound for the sum of\r\n£3,000. Any alderman or commoner refusing to be so joined was to be forced\r\nto lend £1,000 on his own account. The assurance of the king’s lands was\r\nto be made in the names of such aldermen and commoners as the Court of\r\nAldermen should appoint. A week later (27 May) the Court of Aldermen, in\r\nanticipation of the money being raised, ordered an advance to be made to\r\nthe king out of the City’s Chamber of the sum of £14,000.(287) On the 2nd\r\nJune the king’s mortgage was executed;(288) and there being no longer any\r\nnecessity for keeping the bonds entered into by various aldermen for the\r\npayment of interest due to contributors to the loan of £100,000, they were\r\nordered to be cancelled.(289) In November the lords of the council wrote\r\nto the City for an extension of time for the repayment of the\r\n£60,000.(290)\r\n\r\n(M115)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st May Charles was married by proxy at Paris to Henrietta Maria.\r\nWhen the news of the marriage treaty between England and France reached\r\nLondon in the previous November the citizens showed their joy by bonfires\r\nand fireworks.(291) They forgot for a while the danger likely to arise\r\nfrom the heir to the throne allying himself in marriage with a Catholic\r\nprincess. On her arrival in the Thames in June the citizens gave her a\r\nhearty welcome, whilst the fleet, which was about to set sail—few knew\r\nwhither—fired such a salute as the queen had never heard before.(292)\r\n\r\n(M116)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (1 May) Charles had issued his warrant to the lord mayor\r\nfor levying 1,000 men—\"part of 10,000 to be raised by our dear father’s\r\ngracious purpose, according to the advice of both his Houses of\r\nParliament, in contemplation of the distress and necessity of our dear\r\nbrother and sister.\"(293) He thought that if he could only gain a victory\r\nit would serve to draw a veil over his delinquencies. The City was to be\r\nassisted by the county of Middlesex in raising the men,(294) and an\r\nallowance was made for \"coat and conduct money\" for the soldiers at the\r\nrate of eightpence apiece per day for their journey to Plymouth, the place\r\nwhere they were to embark (£400), and four shillings a coat (£200), the\r\npay of a captain being four shillings a day.(295) The mayor’s precept to\r\nthe aldermen to raise the men enjoined them to search all inns, taverns,\r\nalehouses, \"tabling-houses\" and tobacco-houses, and to press, especially,\r\nall \"tapsters, ostlers, chamberlains, vagrants, idle and suspected\r\npersons.\"(296) By August the condition of the troops at Plymouth was\r\npitiable. No money was forthcoming for wages, and the soldiers were forced\r\nto forage for themselves in the neighbouring country. At last the fleet\r\nset sail (8 Oct., 1625). Its destination proved to be Cadiz, whither it\r\nwas despatched in the hope of securing West Indian treasure on its way\r\nhome. The expedition, however, turned out to be as complete a failure as\r\nthat under Mansfeld in the previous year.\r\n\r\n(M117)\r\n\r\nThe citizen soldiers returned to find their city almost deserted owing to\r\nthe ravages of the plague. In July the sickness had been so great as to\r\nnecessitate the adjournment of parliament to Oxford.(297) The colder\r\nweather, as winter approached, appears to have made but little difference.\r\nDr. Donne, the Dean of St. Paul’s, estimated that in November there died a\r\nthousand a day in the city of London and within the circuit of a mile.\r\n\"The citizens fled away as out of a house on fire,\" he writes,(298) they\r\n\"stuffed their pockets with their best ware and threw themselves into the\r\nhighways, and were not received so much as into barns, and perished so,\r\nsome of them with more money about them than would have bought the village\r\nwhere they died.\" Donne himself removed to Chelsea, but the infection even\r\nthere became so great that \"it was no good manners to go to any other\r\nplace,\" and Donne therefore did not go to court. As early as September the\r\nwant and misery in the city was described as being the greatest that ever\r\nany man living knew: \"No trading at all, the rich all gone, house-keepers\r\nand apprentices of manual trades begging in the streets, and that in such\r\na lamentable manner as will make the strongest heart to yearn.\"(299)\r\n\r\n(M118)\r\n\r\nThe new year brought relief, and Sunday, the 29th Jan. (1626) was\r\nappointed a solemn day of thanksgiving to Almighty God for his mercy in\r\n\"stayinge his hand.\"(300) The civic authorities, however, were scarcely\r\nrid of one trouble before they found others springing up. Towards the\r\nclose of the last year a committee had been appointed by the Court of\r\nAldermen to devise measures for relieving the City from the burden of\r\nsupplying military arms and \"other like services\" such as they had\r\nrecently been called upon to perform.(301) The committee had not been long\r\nappointed before the City was called upon to look to its stock of\r\ngunpowder, prepare the trained bands,(302) and furnish the king with five\r\nships towards protecting the river. This last demand was made on the\r\nground that they had furnished vessels for the same purpose in the reign\r\nof Elizabeth.(303) The Court of Aldermen objected. Times were changed\r\nsince Elizabeth’s day, the lords of the council were informed in reply;\r\nthe galleys then furnished by the City were only wanted for a short time\r\nand when the country was threatened with an invasion; but even then\r\nconsiderable difficulty was experienced before the Common Council passed\r\nan Act for supplying the vessels. At the present time, when the City was\r\nin a far worse condition than then, there was little or no hope of a\r\nsimilar Act being passed.(304)\r\n\r\n(M119)\r\n\r\nThe disastrous expedition to Cadiz increased the necessity of summoning a\r\nnew parliament, and on the 16th December the lord keeper was directed to\r\nissue the necessary writs. The enforcement of the recusancy laws, wrung\r\nfrom Charles by the last parliament, had in the meantime been carried out,\r\nand fresh proclamations were issued as the day for the meeting of\r\nparliament (6 Feb.) approached.(305) As soon as the Commons assembled they\r\nchose Sir Heneage Finch, the city’s Recorder, for their Speaker.(306) The\r\nnew parliament was not a whit more inclined to subject its ancient\r\nprivileges to the control of the Crown than its predecessor had been.\r\nBuckingham himself, the king’s bosom friend and most trusted adviser, was\r\nimpeached; and the Commons declined to vote supplies until they had\r\npresented their grievances to the king and received his majesty’s answer.\r\nThis was more than Charles could stand. He summoned them to Whitehall and\r\ncommanded them to cancel the condition. He would give them \"liberty of\r\ncounsel, not of control.\" To the urgent entreaty of the Peers that he\r\nwould grant a short respite he replied, \"Not a minute,\" and on the 15th\r\nJune the parliament of 1626 was dissolved.(307)\r\n\r\n(M120)\r\n\r\nIf the war was to go on it was necessary that money should be found with\r\nor without parliament. Application was made to the City by the lords of\r\nthe council, at first verbally, afterwards by letter, for a loan of\r\n£100,000, and a deputation was ordered to wait upon the king at Greenwich\r\non Sunday, the 25th June, with the City’s answer.(308) The answer given\r\nwas to the effect that the City was unable to advance the sum required,\r\nand it occasioned no little disappointment to the king, who referred the\r\nmatter back to the mayor and aldermen once more. It was not that Charles\r\nhad not offered sufficient security for the loan. The money could not be\r\nraised. At length it was agreed (30 June) at another special court that\r\nthe aldermen themselves should advance the sum of £20,000 for one year on\r\nthe security of the petty customs.(309) In such haste was this trifling\r\nsum required, in order to guard the coast against a rumoured attack from\r\nSpain, that the mayor and aldermen were requested by the lords of the\r\ncouncil to part with the money before the exchequer tallies could be made\r\nout.(310)\r\n\r\n(M121)\r\n\r\nNot only was money wanted, but men and ships. A demand made on the 15th\r\nJuly by the lords of the council for the City to furnish 4,000 men for the\r\ndefence of the Isle of Sheppey(311) was quickly followed (4 Aug.) by\r\nanother for twenty of the best ships in the river, to be fitted out and\r\nvictualled in order that the war might be carried into the enemy’s\r\ncountry.(312) To the first demand \"there was made a double demur, one\r\nbecause the letters came from some of the lords and not from the king;\r\nsecondly, for that by charter they are for the defence of the city, and\r\nnot to go further than the lord mayor goes, unless it be for guard of the\r\nking’s person.\"(313) To the second the mayor was instructed to reply to\r\nthe following effect, viz.—that (1) the City was ready to share with the\r\nrest of his majesty’s subjects in a matter which touched the state and\r\ndefence of the whole kingdom; (2) that inasmuch as the City had been\r\ncalled upon in 1588, when the enemy was upon the coast, to furnish only\r\nten ships, and that each of the twenty ships now demanded would, from its\r\nlarger burden, cost treble the amount of the former ships, the citizens\r\nhumbly desired to be relieved of so great a charge, in respect of the\r\ncity’s decay in trade and commerce, and its impoverishment by the late\r\nvisitation and otherwise; (3) that the ships could not be furnished and\r\nvictualled in the time named; (4) that the city merchants would be the\r\nmore willing to adventure their lives and means against the enemy if they\r\nwere allowed letters of mark.(314)\r\n\r\nThe Lords expressed the greatest dissatisfaction at this answer, and\r\ninsisted upon the ships being forthcoming. It was in vain that the City\r\noffered to provide ten ships and two pinnaces; nothing less than the full\r\nnumber of vessels would suffice, and the City had eventually to give\r\nway.(315)\r\n\r\n(M122)\r\n\r\nIn order to fit out the vessels the sum of £18,000 had to be raised.(316)\r\nMuch indignation was caused by this further tax on the purses of the\r\ncitizens. Many stoutly refused to pay; and the constables whose duty it\r\nwas to distrain in such cases manifested great reluctance to proceed to\r\nextremities. When they did make an effort to carry out their instructions\r\nthe people rescued one another. The result was that the Chamber of the\r\ncity had to make up a large deficiency.(317)\r\n\r\n(M123)\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham, the king’s favourite, whose extravagant projects\r\nhad ended in nothing but disaster, had rendered himself most unpopular,\r\nand one day in August his coach was stopped by a band of sailors, men who\r\nhad served in the ill-fated expedition to Cadiz or in the ships which\r\nBuckingham had sent to assist the French king in suppressing the Huguenots\r\nof Rochelle—who clamoured for arrears of pay. The duke put them off with\r\nfair words, and so escaped with a whole skin; but for long afterwards the\r\nstreets of the city, and even the confines of the royal palace, were\r\ninfested with disaffected seamen, and special precautions had to be taken\r\nto prevent riot.(318)\r\n\r\n(M124)\r\n\r\nHaving failed to raise the necessary supplies by a free gift or\r\nbenevolence of the nation, Charles betook himself to a forced loan. The\r\nsum to be raised was fixed at five subsidies. Commissioners were appointed\r\nin September, 1626, to summon before them all men rated in the subsidy\r\nbooks. At first the scheme was confined to the five counties nearest\r\nLondon. Opposition was met by imprisonment. The City for awhile was left\r\nuntouched. It was unwise to try the temper of the citizens too much. It\r\nwas found that the nearer the City the greater was the opposition shown to\r\nthe commissioners; and the inhabitants of the Strand and the Savoy offered\r\na more determined resistance than those of the parish of St. Margaret,\r\nWestminster, or St. Martin-in-the-Fields.(319) On the 7th October a\r\nproclamation(320) appeared setting forth his majesty’s \"clear intention\"\r\nin requiring the aid of his loving subjects by the loan. It was not to be\r\nmade a precedent, and a parliament should be called as soon as convenient\r\nand as often as it should be necessary.\r\n\r\n(M125)\r\n\r\nJust at a time when privy councillors were about to set out for the more\r\ndistant counties to collect the subsidies the judges suddenly pronounced\r\nan unanimous opinion against the legality of the new loan. The report of\r\ntheir decision quickly spread, and increased the opposition of the country\r\ngentry, many of whom were content to suffer imprisonment rather than yield\r\nto the demands of the commissioners.\r\n\r\n(M126)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th November the committee appointed to take in hand the\r\npreparation of the citizens’ fleet reported to the Common Council that the\r\nlords of the council had made a request that the City would provision ten\r\nout of the twenty ships for a further period of two or three months, in\r\norder that they might join two of his majesty’s ships and fifteen\r\nHollanders in a descent on the Spanish coast. The court, after due\r\nconsideration, directed the committee to wait upon the lords and inform\r\nthem that the City was prepared to spend £1,200 on further victualling,\r\nprovided the ships were commanded by officers of the City’s choosing, and\r\nwere sent to sea alone \"to be at their own liberties and directions\r\nwithout joining or being consorted with any others whatsoever.\" The City\r\nwas, moreover, to be provided with letters of mark, and to be allowed to\r\nenjoy the benefit of all prizes.(321) The result of the interview was\r\nreported to the Common Council on the 14th November, when it was clearly\r\npointed out what the lords of the council were ready to concede and what\r\nnot.(322) After more haggling,(323) the ships were at length got ready and\r\nplaced under the command of Captain John Pennington, a cousin of Alderman\r\nIsaac Pennington, of whom we shall hear more later on. Pennington had but\r\na poor opinion of the fleet; the ships were badly manned and unfit for\r\nmen-of-war; \"with two of the king’s ships he would undertake to beat the\r\nwhole fleet about which so much noise had been raised.\"(324)\r\n\r\n(M127)\r\n\r\nIn 1627 war broke out between England and France, and payment of the\r\nforced loan was more strictly exacted. On the 14th June the lords of the\r\ncouncil wrote to the mayor reminding him of the king’s urgent need of\r\nmoney. The greatest part of the kingdom had well expressed their affection\r\nand had sent in their moneys to the Exchequer. Because London had been\r\nfound so slack their lordships had been commanded to call upon the lord\r\nmayor to send in forthwith the moneys already collected towards the loan,\r\nand to call for all moneys promised.(325) Many of the citizens declined\r\naltogether to contribute, and fourteen were committed to prison.(326)\r\nWrits of _habeas corpus_ were obtained on their behalf—but not before\r\nNovember—and Counsel, of whom the Recorder was one, were appointed for\r\ntheir defence. They were eventually set at liberty without trial.(327)\r\n\r\n(M128)\r\n\r\nWhilst a small force, to which the City contributed a contingent of 300\r\nmen,(328) was sent to assist the King of Denmark, a fleet was despatched\r\n(27 June, 1627) to the Isle of Rhé, under the Duke of Buckingham, with the\r\nobject of relieving Rochelle. The expedition failed in its purpose and\r\nBuckingham had soon to ask for reinforcements. In August the City was\r\ncalled upon by the king to furnish 100 men towards making up the losses\r\nsustained, for which the Chamberlain was authorised to disburse £50 in\r\nimpress money.(329) In October Charles asked for 250 soldiers in addition\r\nto those already raised, and these were found without drawing upon the\r\ntrained bands.(330) In spite of all efforts there was great delay in\r\nforwarding to Buckingham the reinforcements in which he stood in sore\r\nneed, and in November he was forced to return home, baffled in his\r\nenterprise, and with a loss from war and disease of little less than 4,000\r\nmen.(331)\r\n\r\n(M129)\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived for some arrangements to be made for discharging\r\nthe king’s debt to the City.(332) After protracted negotiations an\r\nagreement, known at the present day as the \"royal contract,\" was drawn up\r\nand executed (3 Jan., 1628) whereby the citizens covenanted to advance the\r\nking a further sum of £120,000 by instalments of £60,000 at an interval of\r\nsix months, whilst Charles, on the other hand, covenanted to convey to the\r\nCity certain lands, tenements and hereditaments.(333) The City at once set\r\nto work to raise the money required among the livery companies. The\r\nMerchant Taylors were called upon to contribute £6,300, the highest sum.\r\nThe Grocers came next with £6,000, after which follow the Haberdashers\r\n(£4,800), the Drapers (£4,608), the Goldsmiths (£4,380), the Mercers\r\n(£3,720), the Fishmongers and Clothworkers (each £3,390) and the Vintners\r\n(£3,120).(334) Certain members of the Vintners’ Company having proved\r\nrefractory, the master and wardens complained to the Court of Aldermen,\r\nwho promptly committed the offenders to prison, thereby earning the\r\napproval of his majesty.(335) In cases where the master and wardens of a\r\ncompany had shown neglect in gathering the company’s quota they were\r\nthemselves committed to Newgate.(336)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Aldermen even committed one of their own body for refusing to\r\ncontribute his quota.(337) With difficulty the first instalment of £60,000\r\nwas raised, several of the companies being forced to part with their\r\nplate.(338)\r\n\r\n(M130)\r\n\r\nIn such a hurry was Charles for the money that the aldermen had to advance\r\nhim £20,000 out of the £60,000 on their own personal security. This was in\r\nFebruary. Discharged seamen were again clamouring for pay, and the\r\nExchequer was empty. The aldermen came to his assistance, but, inasmuch as\r\nthe lands and tenements had not yet been conveyed to the City according to\r\nthe terms of the late agreement, the Court of Aldermen passed a formal\r\nresolution that no further advances should be made until \"one or more\r\nbooks of the lands to be assured by the contract be passed under the great\r\nseale of England.\"(339)\r\n\r\n(M131)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the growing unpopularity of Buckingham, the king\r\nabsolutely refused to abandon his favourite, against whom all kinds of\r\nrumours were astir. Nothing was too bad to be believed of him, and popular\r\nfury spared neither him nor his friends. Dr. Lamb, an astrologer and quack\r\ndoctor, was set upon in the city as being one of the latter, and was\r\nnearly done to death one night whilst returning home from supper. None\r\nwould receive into his house the almost lifeless body of the\r\nnecromancer—the duke’s devil, as he was called—who supplied him with love\r\npotions wherewith to corrupt women. He was at last removed to one of the\r\ncompters, where he died the following day.(340) Charles was highly\r\nincensed on hearing of the occurrence, more especially as some of the\r\nmurderers had been heard to say that if Lamb’s \"master\"—the duke\r\nhimself—had been there they would have handled him worse and so minced his\r\nflesh that every one should have had a bit of him. He forthwith summoned\r\nthe mayor and sheriffs to court and threatened to take away their charter\r\nif the murderers were not quickly discovered.(341) The lords of the\r\ncouncil also wrote to the mayor (15 June) reprimanding him for not taking\r\nsteps to repress the riot and ordering him to seize the principal actors\r\nand abettors and commit them to prison.(342) These were not so easily to\r\nbe discovered, but the Court of Aldermen (17 June) committed to Newgate\r\ntwo of the City Marshal’s men for neglecting to give notice of the\r\ndisturbance to the mayor or sheriffs, or even to the alderman or deputy of\r\nthe ward, as in duty bound.(343) Others were taken on suspicion but were\r\nshortly afterwards set at liberty by order of the lords of the council (23\r\nJune).(344) The matter eventually ended by the City being fined\r\n£1,000.(345) In the meantime libellous placards(346) appeared stuck up in\r\nColeman Street, and the Court of Aldermen committed a man to prison for no\r\nother reason than because he took one down to read and after reading it\r\nput it up again. That at least was the man’s own story.(347)\r\n\r\n(M132) (M133)\r\n\r\nEarly in July the balance of the second instalment of £60,000 (part of the\r\nlate loan of £120,000) was due from the City, but Charles could not wait\r\nso long. An expedition to Rochelle under the Earl of Denbigh had recently\r\nproved a failure. Determined not to give way, Charles sent orders to the\r\nearl to refit his squadron and remain in England until the whole available\r\nmaritime force of the country could be got ready to accompany him. Money\r\nmust be raised at once. Charles himself wrote to the mayor and aldermen\r\n(30 June) stating that a sudden and important occasion of the relief of\r\nRochelle required present succours, and directing them to find immediately\r\nthe sum of £20,000 out of the moneys due on the last purchase of the Crown\r\nlands. If they had not such a sum in hand they were to raise it on\r\ncredit.(348) This sum exactly represented the balance due from the City to\r\nthe king, and precepts had already been issued to the livery companies for\r\nraising the amount. Another precept was sent out immediately on receipt of\r\nthe king’s letter, whilst other precepts were directed to levying the\r\nsubsidies granted by parliament.(349) The fate of Rochelle was, in spite\r\nof every effort, soon to be sealed. The Duke of Buckingham fell by the\r\nhand of an assassin (23 Aug.) whilst engaged at Portsmouth in\r\nsuperintending preparations for its relief, and two months later (18 Oct.)\r\nthe fortress was compelled to capitulate.\r\n\r\n(M134) (M135)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the question of the king’s right to claim Tonnage and\r\nPoundage for life had given rise to so much opposition that Charles had\r\noccasion more than once to prorogue parliament. Merchants had refused to\r\npay the dues, and their goods had been seized. Recourse was thereupon had\r\nto the Sheriffs’ Court of the City, where the owners sued out a replevin\r\nas for property illegally distrained. Popular feeling was so much on the\r\nside of the merchants that when parliament met Charles publicly renounced\r\nall claim to tonnage and poundage as a right. Nevertheless the contest\r\ncontinued, and the feeling of both parties was embittered by mutual\r\nprovocation and by proceedings taken in the Star Chamber against merchants\r\nfor protecting their property from these exactions. At length matters\r\nreached such a crisis that Charles determined upon an adjournment; but no\r\nsooner was the king’s intention divined than the Commons determined to put\r\ntheir grievances into writing and to cause them to be read by the Speaker,\r\nwhom they forcibly detained in the chair. Sir John Finch having refused to\r\naccede to their request, resolutions condemning religious innovation, as\r\nwell as the levying of tonnage and poundage, were hastily put and carried\r\nby acclamation, whilst Black Rod was vainly endeavouring to gain admission\r\nto the House with a message from the king. Before admittance was granted\r\nthe House had voted its own adjournment. On the 10th March it was\r\ndissolved,(350) not to be summoned again until eleven years had passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\n(M136)\r\n\r\nThe years immediately succeeding the dissolution of Charles’s third\r\nparliament, during which he was preparing a system of personal government\r\ndestined eventually to work his own destruction, were years of sorrow and\r\ntrouble to the citizens of London. A \"pestilent sickness\" again visited\r\nthe city in the autumn of 1629—brought over from Holland or Rochelle—and\r\nremained until 1631. It was followed as usual by a great scarcity of\r\nprovisions. The civic authorities did what they could to prevent the\r\nspread of infection and to alleviate the distress, but it was to little\r\npurpose. Riots were of frequent occurrence, necessitating the keeping a\r\n_posse_ of constables quartered in the Mercers’ chapel.(351) Doggrel\r\nrhymes appeared in 1630(352) threatening the wealthier class with mischief\r\nif food were not forthcoming—\r\n\r\nThe corne is so dear\r\nI dout mani will starve this yeare.\r\nIf you see not to this\r\nSum of you will speed amiss.\r\nOur souls they are dear,\r\nFor our bodyes have sume ceare.\r\nBefore we arise\r\nLess will safise.\r\n\r\n(M137)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the general gloom one bright spot appeared, namely, the\r\nbirth of an heir to the crown (29 May, 1630), an event which the king lost\r\nno time in communicating to the mayor and Common Council of the city—his\r\n\"principal city and chamber.\"(353) On the occasion of the christening of\r\nthe infant prince the bells of the city churches were set ringing,(354)\r\nand he was presented with a fair large standing cup of gold with cover,\r\nweighing nearly 300 ounces, and enclosed in a case of crimson velvet, the\r\ncost of the whole exceeding £1,000.(355) Two years later, when the prince\r\nwas carried into the city to witness the pageants on lord mayor’s day, the\r\nCourt of Aldermen were so gratified with this unexpected mark of royal\r\nfavour that they forthwith voted the babe a gift of £500.(356)\r\n\r\n(M138)\r\n\r\nThe year following the birth of Prince Charles the queen was robbed of a\r\ngreat part of her plate and jewels. As the thieves were likely to dispose\r\nof their booty among the goldsmiths of the city, a precept was issued to\r\nthe master and wardens of the Goldsmiths’ Company to try and recover\r\nit.(357) The goldsmiths had long ago begun to leave Goldsmiths’ Row in\r\nCheapside, and to set up shops in different parts of the city, and in 1623\r\nthey had been ordered to resume their old quarters, which in the meantime\r\nhad been given up to poor petty trades.(358) It was easier to trace lost\r\nproperty when all the goldsmiths were congregated together in one spot.\r\nThis order, however, was so ineffectually carried out that another order\r\nwas issued by the lords of the council ten years later directing all\r\ngoldsmiths to find shops for themselves either in Cheapside or Lombard\r\nStreet within the next six months, inasmuch as the practice of setting up\r\ntheir shops in obscure places in different parts of the city offered\r\nfacilities for abuses, and more especially \"in passing away of stolen\r\nplate.\"(359)\r\n\r\n(M139)\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the king’s departure for Scotland in May, 1633, the\r\nCourt of Aldermen voted him a present of £2,000 \"in two severall purses of\r\nvelvett or sattin,\" as a pledge of the City’s true loyalty, love and\r\nobedience to his majesty.(360) After he had gone the mayor and aldermen\r\nproceeded in State to Richmond to pay their respects to the queen and to\r\noffer her a bason and ewer of gold of the value of £800, with her arms\r\nengraved thereon.(361)\r\n\r\n(M140)\r\n\r\nIn the following November the Duke of York was christened, the ceremony\r\nbeing attended by the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, as well as the chief\r\nofficers of the City. The infant prince was presented with a gilt cup and\r\ncover weighing sixty ounces, and containing the sum of £500 in gold.\r\nSimilar fees were paid to the midwife, nurse and \"rockers\" to those paid\r\non the occasion of the baptism of his elder brother.(362) During the\r\nabsence of the mayor and aldermen at St. James’, where the ceremony took\r\nplace, a double watch was ordered to be kept in the city.(363)\r\n\r\n(M141)\r\n\r\nFive years had now elapsed since the dissolution of the last parliament,\r\nduring which time the country had submitted to the personal government of\r\nCharles. Matters might have continued on the same footing for some time\r\nlonger had not Charles conceived the idea of claiming the sovereignty of\r\nthe seas as a pretext for raising a fleet. The difficulty then arose as to\r\nhow to equip a fleet without summoning a parliament. It had been the\r\ncustom ever since the time of the Plantagenets to call upon maritime towns\r\nto furnish ships ready manned for the defence of the realm at a time of\r\nthreatened invasion. This custom had been rendered sufficiently elastic to\r\ncomprise the port of London, and the City had frequently been called upon\r\nto furnish a contingent of vessels in time of war. Occasionally a protest\r\nmay have been made against such demands, but they were seldom, if ever,\r\naltogether refused. On the 20th October, 1634, writs were issued calling\r\nupon the city of London and various port towns and places along the coast\r\nto furnish a certain number of ships of war, and to have them ready at\r\nPortsmouth by the 1st March, 1635. In many cases it was impossible to\r\nsupply ships of the size required, and in these the king offered to supply\r\nships of his own on condition that the port towns should equip and man\r\nthem. London was called upon to supply seven ships varying in size from\r\n300 to 900 tons, with an equipment of from 150 to 350 men.\r\n\r\n(M142)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Aldermen appointed (13 Nov.) a committee to consider this\r\nwrit to the City as well as another sent to the borough of Southwark, and\r\nto learn what had formerly been done in like case. The City’s records were\r\nto be consulted with the view of ascertaining how far it was exempt from\r\nsuch charges, and the City’s Solicitor was to attend them on that\r\nbehalf.(364) The law officers had previously been directed (6 Nov.) to\r\nconsult together on the matter, and the Town Clerk had received orders to\r\ntranslate the writs into English and make copies of the same.(365)\r\n\r\n(M143)\r\n\r\nWhen the matter came before the Common Council that body, after serious\r\nconsideration, decided (2 Dec.) to present a petition to his majesty\r\nsetting forth that, by ancient privileges, grants and Acts of Parliament,\r\nwhich were ready to be produced, the City was exempt from any such\r\nobligation as that contained in the writ, and praying that the City’s\r\nprivileges might be upheld.(366)\r\n\r\n(M144)\r\n\r\nThe only effect of this petition was to cause another writ to be issued a\r\nweek later (9 Dec.) enjoining specific performance of the former\r\nwrit.(367) Finding that there was no way of escape the mayor, Sir Robert\r\nParkhurst, began to take the necessary steps for raising £30,000, the sum\r\nrequired from the different wards.(368) On Sunday, the 14th December,\r\nRobert Mason, who had recently been appointed Recorder in succession to\r\nLittleton, on the king’s own recommendation (although the election is\r\nrecorded as having been according to \"antient custom and freedom of\r\nelection\"!),(369) appeared before the lords of the council with an account\r\nof the progress made in the city in the matter of the ships, with which\r\nCharles was well pleased, and the Recorder was ordered to attend the\r\ncouncil every Sunday afternoon with a similar account \"untill the worke be\r\nperfected.\"(370) On the 19th the Court of Aldermen appointed a committee\r\nto fit out the ships as required, but they were limited in expenditure to\r\nthe sum of £30,000.(371) On the 17th February, 1635, the committee\r\nreported to the court that his majesty had resolved that two of the City’s\r\nships should be assigned to the admiral and vice-admiral of the fleet, and\r\nthat they should be fitted out by the care and oversight of officers of\r\nthe navy. For this purpose the sum of £11,475, out of the £30,000 already\r\nvoted, was ordered to be paid to the treasurer of the navy, whilst the\r\ncommittee proceeded with the business of the other five ships.(372)\r\n\r\n(M145)\r\n\r\nHitherto all had promised well, but on the 4th August Charles thought fit\r\nto issue another writ calling upon the nation at large, and not only port\r\nand maritime towns, to furnish ship money, on the ground that as all were\r\nconcerned in the mutual defence of one another, so all might contribute\r\ntowards the defence of the realm.(373) The City found itself called upon\r\nto provide two more vessels of 800 tons apiece.(374) The authorities,\r\nhowever, were so slow in executing this further order that the Sheriffs\r\nwere made to appear every Sunday before the lords of the council to report\r\nwhat progress was being made.(375)\r\n\r\n(M146)\r\n\r\nIn June, 1636, Richard Chambers, a merchant, who had previously displayed\r\na bold front against the king’s demand of tonnage and poundage, for which\r\nthe Star Chamber had condemned him to a term of imprisonment (1628-1629),\r\nagain came to the fore, and carried the question of the king’s right to\r\nlevy ship money to the Court of King’s Bench.  The judges, however,\r\nrefused to allow the question to be argued. \"There was a rule of law and a\r\nrule of government\"—said Justice Berkeley, scarce realising the true\r\nimport of his words—\"and many things which might not be done by the rule\r\nof law might be done by the rule of government.\" Chambers was again\r\ncommitted for contempt, but was afterwards liberated from prison upon\r\npayment of the £10 at which he had been assessed. He contented himself\r\nwith bringing an action in the King’s Bench against the mayor, who had\r\nmade the assessment on the ground of some technical informality.(376)\r\n\r\n(M147)\r\n\r\nOther matters had arisen lately—\"great and important businesses\"—all\r\ntending towards an estrangement of the City from the king. Early in 1635\r\nthe City had been condemned by the Court of Star Chamber to a fine of\r\n£70,000 and the loss of its Irish estate for having, as was alleged,\r\nbroken the terms of the charter under which their Irish estate was held.\r\nOne of the charges against the city and the companies was that they\r\ncontinued to employ the \"mere Irish\" on their estates instead of\r\nrelegating them to the narrow limits reserved for them, there to perish of\r\ndisease or starvation.(377) There were differences too touching the Royal\r\nContract, differences as to the City’s rights to estreated recognisances,\r\nas to pretended encroachments and other matters. It was felt that there\r\nwould be no peace until some arrangement could be made with Charles on all\r\nthe matters in question, and for this purpose a committee was appointed in\r\nMay, 1636, to see what could be done. A schedule of \"thinges desired by\r\nthe cittie of London\" was drawn up, and an offer was made to the king of\r\nthe sum of £100,000, to be paid by annual instalments of £20,000, if he\r\nwould make the concessions desired.(378) The king’s commissioners, who had\r\nthe business in hand, refused the offer. They informed the committee that\r\nnot only would the City have to surrender certain valuable fisheries and\r\nother privileges in Ireland, as well as the castle of Culmore, but it\r\nwould have to provide an allowance of £5,000 to Sir Thomas Philips.\r\nInstead of £100,000 it would have moreover to pay £120,000.(379)\r\nNegotiations continued for two years. Eventually a compromise was effected\r\nin June, 1638, and the city was fain to accept a pardon on surrendering\r\nits Irish estates and payment of the comparatively small sum of\r\n£12,000,(380) of which the queen happened at that time to stand in need.\r\nThe patents of the Irish Society and of the companies were not however\r\nactually surrendered until 1639.(381)\r\n\r\n(M148)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Charles had given umbrage to the City in other matters,\r\nmore especially in the measures he had taken for regulating trade and the\r\ninstitution of corporate monopolies. An order restricting the use of\r\ncoaches and carts, and forbidding anyone to keep a carriage unless he was\r\nalso prepared to keep four sufficient horses or geldings for the king’s\r\nservice, weighed heavily upon the mayor and aldermen of the city, who were\r\nfor the most part men advanced in years and whose duties carried them a\r\ngood deal abroad. They therefore petitioned the king for an exception to\r\nbe made in their favour. The petition was granted, but only after long\r\ndelay.(382)\r\n\r\n(M149)\r\n\r\nThe civic authorities were not better pleased with the king for his having\r\n(1636), in spite of all protest, created a new corporation which embraced\r\nall tradesmen and artificers in the city and suburbs, and thus threatened\r\nto be a formidable rival to the ancient corporation.(383)\r\n\r\n(M150)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a growing feeling of dissatisfaction at the existing state\r\nof things, a third writ for ship money appeared (9 Oct., 1636). It raised\r\nsuch a storm of opposition in every quarter, however, that Charles once\r\nmore appealed to the judges for a formal acknowledgment of his right.\r\nTheir opinion proving favourable,(384) the work went on and the City was\r\ncalled upon (Sept., 1637) to furnish two ships each of 700 tons.(385)\r\n\r\nIn the following year, after Hampden’s case had been decided, Charles\r\ncontinued to levy ship money, and the City was told to furnish a ship of\r\n500 tons (5 Nov., 1638). The cost was estimated at £1,000. The usual\r\nprecept was issued (26 Nov.) to the alderman of each ward for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining how best that sum could be raised.(386) The returns must\r\nhave been unfavourable, for on the 29th January (1639) the Court of\r\nAldermen appointed a committee to wait upon the lord high admiral and\r\nexplain to him that the City was not in a position to fit out another\r\nship.(387) The money was eventually raised by the twelve principal livery\r\ncompanies, seven of which contributed £100 apiece and the other five\r\n£60.(388)\r\n\r\n(M151)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime troubles had arisen in Scotland through Charles’s\r\nill-advised and bigoted attempt to impose upon his northern subjects a\r\nBook of Common Prayer. By midsummer (1638) he was preparing for war and\r\nwould shortly be under the necessity of applying to the city for money and\r\nmen. It was probably with this end in view that he granted (18 Oct., 1638)\r\nto the citizens an ample inspeximus charter, confirming to them their\r\nancient privileges and franchises. Negotiations for a new charter had been\r\ngoing on since the preceding March(389) (if not earlier), and it was only\r\nnow conceded on payment of a sum of £12,000.(390)\r\n\r\n(M152)\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the new year (4 Jan., 1639) Charles applied by letter\r\nunder his hand to the City for a liberal contribution and assistance\r\ntowards putting down the disorders in Scotland, notifying at the same time\r\nthe fact that he had called upon the peers of the realm to attend in\r\nperson at York by the 1st April. The letter was read to the court of\r\nCommon Council on the 12th February, but the matter seemed of so great\r\nimportance that further consideration of it was adjourned to the 16th,\r\nwhen it was agreed to issue a precept to the alderman of each ward to take\r\nsteps for raising a free and liberal contribution.(391) A month elapsed,\r\nand notwithstanding every effort of the aldermen, less than £5,000 was got\r\ntogether. The aldermen were directed to renew their efforts, but this only\r\nresulted in increasing the amount by £200 or £220.(392) The whole amount\r\nwas so small that it was contemptuously refused. At the beginning of April\r\nCharles found himself at York with an indifferent army, and with little\r\nprospect of being in a position to maintain even that army beyond a very\r\nlimited period.\r\n\r\n(M153)\r\n\r\nIn June he caused another application to be made to the City.(393) On the\r\n7th the lord mayor, who had been summoned to appear before the lords of\r\nthe council, appeared with so few of his brother aldermen that he was\r\nordered to go back and to return on the 10th with the whole court. When\r\nthey at last made their appearance they were told that the king expected\r\nfrom them no less a sum than £100,000. The war was, if possible, more\r\nunpopular in the city than in the country. The memory of the recent\r\nconfiscation of their Irish estates had not been obliterated from the\r\nminds of the citizens by the subsequent grant of a charter. The mayor and\r\naldermen replied that it was impossible to find the money. The council\r\ntold them that it must be done, one of the lords declaring that they ought\r\nto have sold their chains and gowns before making such a reply. They were\r\nordered to appear once more on the 12th June with a final answer.(394)\r\n\r\n(M154)\r\n\r\nA warrant had in the meantime been issued for raising 3000 men from the\r\ntrained bands of the city for service in Scotland.(395) Although it does\r\nnot appear that this demand was acceded to,(396) seeing that the trained\r\nbands were a force especially intended for the defence of the city,\r\ngreater activity was shown in making the city’s troops as perfect in their\r\ndrill as circumstances permitted.(397) Boys from Christ’s Hospital and\r\nBridewell were taught to play the drum and fife, weapons were marked, and\r\nmusters held in Goodman’s Fields and elsewhere under the eye of Captain\r\nJohn Fisher, recently appointed muster-master.(398)\r\n\r\n(M155)\r\n\r\nThat the citizens were not indisposed to assist the king, if left to\r\nthemselves and not subjected to threats and intimidation, is shown by the\r\nfact that, in anticipation of the return of Charles from the North, the\r\nCommon Council voted him (31 July, 1639) the sum of £10,000 as a free gift\r\nin consideration that the City had not contributed anything to his majesty\r\non his setting out, as had been required, \"albeit the counties and private\r\npersonnes both nobles and others had done the same.\"(399) Even this small\r\nsum could not be raised without resorting to sheriffs’ fines, no less than\r\nsixteen individuals being mulcted for refusing to serve as sheriff in less\r\nthan two months.(400) It was no difficult task to find men unwilling to\r\nserve such a thankless office at so critical a time.\r\n\r\n(M156)\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year (1639) the country was agreeably surprised at\r\nthe news that it was the king’s intention to summon a parliament.\r\nParliament opened on the 13th April (1640). Few of its members could have\r\nserved in the last parliament of eleven years before, but although so long\r\na time had elapsed since the Commons had met, they had not forgotten their\r\nold constitutional claims to have the country’s grievances redressed\r\nbefore proceeding to grant supplies. An offer to relinquish ship money\r\nproved insufficient, and after three weeks the \"short parliament\" was\r\ndissolved (5 May, 1640).\r\n\r\n(M157)\r\n\r\nFor some days before parliament was dissolved every effort had been made\r\nby the king to get the mayor and aldermen to lend him £100,000. This being\r\nfound impossible, the mayor, Henry Garway, or Garraway, was directed to\r\nmake out a list of the wealthiest commoners. After several attempts to\r\nnegotiate with the aldermen individually, they were summoned to appear in\r\na body on Sunday, the 11th April. Charles himself then told them that his\r\nnecessity at the time was so great that he must borrow £100,000 of the\r\nCity; that he must not be denied; the money he must have at once, as it\r\nwould benefit him more then than twenty subsidies granted by parliament\r\nafterwards. After the king had finished speaking the Lord Privy Seal(401)\r\naddressed them, setting forth that a similar sum had been advanced by the\r\nCity to King James; that he himself, being Recorder at the time, had lent\r\n£3,000 towards it, and that the money had been repaid with interest. The\r\nCity, he continued, was rather beholden to his majesty for taking the\r\nmoney and repaying it with interest, than the king beholden to the City\r\nfor lending it. He further instanced the case of the City having lent King\r\nHenry III a sum of £100,000 rather than allow that monarch to pledge his\r\ncrown and jewels to the merchants of the Steelyard, and it was truly\r\nrepaid. To this the aldermen were not permitted to make any reply, but\r\nwere sent away to advise together how the sum should be raised.(402)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 7th May, the mayor and aldermen were again summoned\r\nbefore the council, when they were told that, having failed to provide the\r\nsum previously asked for, they would now have to find £200,000. If the\r\nlatter sum was not forthcoming the king threatened to \"have £300,000 of\r\nthe city.\" They were to come again on the following Sunday (10 May) and\r\nbring with them a list of the rich men of the wards.\r\n\r\n(M158)\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed they came, but brought with them a petition to be\r\nexcused making such a list as that required. The excuse was not allowed.\r\nStrafford is recorded as having lost his temper at the obstinacy of the\r\naldermen. \"Sir,\" said he, addressing the king, \"you will never do good to\r\nthese citizens of London till you have made examples of some of the\r\naldermen,\" and recommended Charles, in his own \"thorough\" way, to hang a\r\nfew of them.(403) Charles did not take the advice offered. He would have\r\nmade, however, the mayor resign his sword and collar then and there but\r\nfor the intercession of the bystanders, and actually committed four of the\r\naldermen to prison, viz., Nicholas Rainton, John Gayre, Thomas Soame and\r\nThomas Atkins, for refusing to make a list of those inhabitants of their\r\nrespective wards who were able to lend from £50 upwards.(404) One of them,\r\nAlderman Soame, gave particular offence. \"I was an honest man whilst I was\r\na commoner,\" he told the king to his face, \"and I would continue to be so\r\nnow I am an alderman.\" The other aldermen professed their readiness to\r\ngive in the names of the richer citizens, but objected to rate them\r\naccording to their means.\r\n\r\n(M159)\r\n\r\nBoth Garway and Sir Thomas Gardiner, the Recorder, favoured the king. The\r\nlatter was particularly anxious that the City should lend the £100,000\r\noriginally requested, and did his best to get the money advanced. For his\r\nzeal on this occasion, and for \"other high crimes and misdemeanours,\" he\r\nwas afterwards (1642) impeached.(405)\r\n\r\n(M160)\r\n\r\nThe aldermen were not long kept in confinement. Even before their\r\ncommittal the city was in a ferment, and a placard had appeared posted up\r\nin the Exchange inviting all who were lovers of liberty to assemble in St.\r\nGeorge’s Fields in Southwark early on Monday morning (11 May). Archbishop\r\nLaud was a special object of hatred to the citizens, and against him the\r\nmob directed their attack. As soon as the trained bands, which kept order\r\nduring the day, had retired for the evening, the rabble marched to\r\nLambeth. Laud, however, had been warned in time, and had made good his\r\nescape across the river to Whitehall. The rioters finding themselves\r\nbaulked of their prey retired with threats of returning to burn down the\r\npalace. For the next few days the city was under martial law. A double\r\nwatch was kept in its streets. The companies looked to their store of\r\npowder and match. A strict guard was kept over servants and apprentices,\r\nand a warrant issued for raising 1,000 men of the trained bands, or as\r\nmany more as the lord mayor should think necessary \"to suppress, slay,\r\nkill, destroy and apprehend all such as should be tumultuously assembled\r\nin or about Southwark, Lambeth, Blackheath or elsewhere in parts\r\nadjacent.\"(406)\r\n\r\n(M161)\r\n\r\nIf the royal warrant was to be effectually and loyally carried out some\r\nconcession to the citizens was necessary, and accordingly, on the same day\r\n(15 May) that the warrant appeared, the four aldermen were released.\r\n\r\n(M162)\r\n\r\nPending the negotiations for a loan, payment of ship money had not been\r\nstrictly enforced; but now that threats and entreaties had failed to open\r\nthe purse-strings of the citizens Charles made a desperate effort to exact\r\nship money. On the 9th June, 1640, the lord mayor and both the sheriffs\r\nwere summoned to attend the council to give an account of the ship money\r\ndue from the city. Why had it not been paid in? The mayor replied that he\r\nhad sent his officers to collect, but few or none would pay.(407) Upon the\r\nking telling him that he should have distrained, the mayor remarked that\r\none of his predecessors in office, Sir Edward Bromfield, was still a\r\ndefendant in a suit in the King’s Bench brought against him by Richard\r\nChambers for acting in that manner, and was likely to be cast. \"No man,\"\r\nsaid Charles peremptorily, \"shall suffer for obeying my commands.\" Thus\r\nencouraged the mayor himself made a house-to-house visit the next day,\r\naccompanied by the sheriffs, for the purpose of collecting the money.\r\nThroughout the whole city, however, only one man was found ready and\r\nwilling to pay. When the mayor ordered the sheriffs to distrain they\r\nrefused on the plea that it was the mayor’s business, not theirs. Entering\r\na draper’s shop the mayor attempted to seize a piece of linen cloth; the\r\nowner set about measuring it, and naming the price told the mayor that if\r\nhe persisted in taking it he should esteem it a purchase and put it to his\r\nlordship’s account.(408)\r\n\r\n(M163)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th June the Common Council took into consideration two\r\nletters—one from Charles, dated the 17th March, and another from the lords\r\nof the council, of the 31st May—asking for a city force of 4,000 men (but\r\nnone to be taken out of the trained bands) for service in the north of\r\nEngland, and directing the mayor to see that coat and conduct money was at\r\nonce raised for the purpose.(409) The court declined to come to an\r\nimmediate decision; but on the 15th the lord mayor issued his precept for\r\nthe necessary funds to be levied on the wards.(410)\r\n\r\n(M164)\r\n\r\nOn the 19th July news arrived from the North that the Scots were about to\r\nseize Newcastle—a very serious matter to the Londoners, as they would\r\nthereby be cut off from their supply of coal. Charles took advantage of\r\nthis, writes Dr. Gardiner,(411) and sent Lord Cottington and Sir Henry\r\nVane to the Common Council—specially summoned to meet on the 23rd by the\r\nking’s order(412)—to assure them that if the long-desired loan of £200,000\r\nwere granted the citizens would hear nothing more of the project recently\r\npromulgated of debasing the coinage, a project which, if carried out,\r\nwould have worked great mischief to the London merchant and tradesman.\r\n\"Leaving the Common Council to discuss the demand, the privy councillors\r\namused themselves by strolling through the Cloth Exchange at Blackwell\r\nHall. The owners of cloth gathered quickly round them. They hoped, they\r\nsaid, that they were not to be compelled to sell for copper goods for\r\nwhich sterling silver had been paid. After a debate of an hour and a half\r\nCottington and Vane were re-admitted, to be informed that the Common\r\nCouncil had no power to dispose of the money of the citizens.\"\r\n\r\n(M165)\r\n\r\nHaving failed once more in this direction, and driven to his wits’ end for\r\nmoney, Charles applied to the livery companies for a loan of £120,000.\r\nThey were told that the money was not required for the purpose of making\r\nwar, but only to enable his majesty to make the more honourable peace,\r\nsword in hand. It would be used to pay off the soldiers and so prevent\r\nthem pillaging the country after disbandment. Each company was assessed\r\naccording to its wealth; but most of the principal companies pleaded\r\ninability to subscribe on the ground that the Londonderry plantation had\r\n\"consumed their stocks.\" It was believed at the time that not a tenth part\r\nof the money would be raised.(413)\r\n\r\n(M166)\r\n\r\nSix weeks or more elapsed. The king and nobles were at York holding a\r\ncouncil. The City had been brought into a better humour by a confirmation\r\nof its rights (5 Sept.) to tolls known as \"package\" and \"scavage,\" and a\r\npardon for all past offences in daring to exact such tolls.(414) The\r\ncitizens were still better pleased with a promise of another parliament\r\nwhich Charles made in answer to a petition (24 Sept.),(415) and with the\r\nprospect of a speedy conclusion of peace with Scotland. Under these\r\ncircumstances one last effort was made to get them to advance the\r\nlong-wished-for loan of £200,000. Not only did the king and the lords ride\r\nto the city, but the Earl of Manchester, the Lord Chamberlain, Viscount\r\nCampden, and other lords paid a personal visit to the Guildhall and used\r\ntheir utmost powers to persuade the citizens to advance the money. The\r\nmoney might be paid by two instalments of £50,000 and one instalment of\r\n£100,000 between October and December, and the Peers themselves would give\r\nsecurity for repayment.(416) This time the application was more\r\nsuccessful, thanks to a little high-handedness practised by the lords on\r\nthe Common Council. \"With all diligence becoming us we have gone upon the\r\nbusiness wherewith your majesty and the Peers entrusted us,\" they wrote to\r\nthe king (3 Oct.), giving him a long account of their visit to the\r\ncity.(417) \"On Friday morning (2 Oct.) we desired the lord mayor to call a\r\nCourt of Aldermen at Guildhall, whither we all went, sat with them in\r\ncouncil, and opened to them all our business, and read our letters, which\r\nsatisfied them very much, yet they reserved themselves till they saw how\r\nit would take with the Commons. Then we all went to dinner with the lord\r\nmayor and there appointed to have a Common Council that afternoon, amongst\r\nwhich we mingled divers commoners that were not of the Common Council,\r\nsuch as we knew well affected and powerful in the city.\" We are not\r\nsurprised to learn that this action on the part of the lords was strongly\r\nobjected to as not being altogether regular. The lords insisted, however,\r\nand they were allowed to have their own way. \"At three o’clock that\r\nafternoon,\" the letter goes on to say, \"we met at Guildhall, sat with them\r\nin the Court of Common Council, and according to our instructions\r\nacquainted them with the proceedings of the Assembly of Peers, and used\r\nthe best rhetoric, which was plain remonstrance of all the passages at\r\nYork, not concealing the admirable grace and freeness shown by your\r\nmajesty in this great council, to the infinite content of all the Peers,\r\nnor the true affection shown to you by the Peers.\" They first read the\r\nletter from the lords and then that from his majesty. They feared lest\r\nsome words which his majesty had (falsely) been reported to have uttered\r\non the occasion of the late petition from the City for a parliament might\r\nhave an injurious effect, so they had explained this and other matters,\r\nand the Common Council appeared well satisfied. \"We then withdrew, that\r\nthey before they rose might more freely debate upon the way of raising the\r\nsum desired, for we persuaded ourselves it would not be denied.\" They were\r\nnot disappointed. Before the council rose it resolved to make application\r\nto the livery companies, and a draft of a letter was prepared. A copy of\r\nthis letter the lords forwarded to his majesty. In conclusion they assured\r\nthe king of the great services done in the matter, more particularly by\r\nGarway, the out-going mayor, the Recorder, and the whole bench of\r\naldermen, and suggested the advisability of sending them a letter of\r\nthanks. If the letter were addressed to the whole commonalty so much the\r\nbetter. This suggestion was carried out.(418) There was a difficulty about\r\nthe security for repayment of the loan. It was at one time proposed that\r\nthe queen’s jewels to the value of £100,000 should be taken in pledge, but\r\nthis suggestion was afterwards disavowed by the city.(419)\r\n\r\n(M167)\r\n\r\nOn Michaelmas-day an election of a new mayor took place in succession to\r\nGarway. William Acton was the senior alderman below the chair, but he was\r\nset aside and Edmund Wright and Thomas Soame were returned by the Common\r\nHall. The former was selected by the Court of Aldermen. This much and no\r\nmore we learn from the City’s own record of the election.(420) From other\r\nsources, however, it appears that the election was a very tumultuous one;\r\nthat the wishes of Charles were consulted, and that Acton was elected and\r\nwas afterwards discharged by parliament.(421)\r\n\r\n(M168)\r\n\r\nThe loss of an adherent in the mayor of London did not affect Charles so\r\nmuch as the immediate cutting down of the promised loan to the modest sum\r\nof £50,000, an event which followed, if it were not occasioned by, the\r\nelection of Wright. The delay, moreover, in forwarding to the city the\r\nwrits for the parliament had created a general impression that the promise\r\nof a parliament was a mere device to get money.(422) The king determined\r\nto take no notice of the City’s withdrawal from its original undertaking,\r\nbut sent another letter \"to quicken the business by reason of the\r\nstraitness of time.\"(423)\r\n\r\n(M169)\r\n\r\nIt only remained for Charles to make the best terms with the Scots that he\r\ncould. Negotiations were accordingly opened at Ripon by commissioners\r\nappointed by both parties (2 Oct.), with the result that a cessation of\r\narms, under certain conditions, was agreed to until a permanent treaty\r\ncould be arranged in London (21 Oct.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M170) (M171)\r\n\r\nParliament—the Long Parliament—met as promised on the 3rd November, 1640.\r\nCharles had intended to nominate Sir Thomas Gardiner, the Recorder, a\r\ndevoted adherent of the Crown, as Speaker of the Commons; but since the\r\ndays of Heneage Finch the City had failed to return its Recorder to\r\nparliament.(424) Charles was therefore obliged to look elsewhere. His\r\nchoice fell upon William Lenthall, who was the first to realise the\r\nposition of a Speaker in times of political controversy, and who\r\nthroughout his career acted up to his famous dictum, that \"he had neither\r\neyes to see nor tongue to speak, save as the House was pleased to direct\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n(M172)\r\n\r\nAs soon as parliament met, Strafford, who was only too conscious of his\r\nimpending fate, determined to take the bull by the horns, and to use every\r\nmeans to induce the king to anticipate the blow by boldly accusing the\r\nparliamentary leaders of treasonable designs. His efforts were futile.\r\nRightly or wrongly, it was generally believed that he intended to\r\nestablish a military despotism in England, and that London was to be\r\nbrought into subjection. The way in which it was all to be effected was\r\neven described by Cradock, one of the city members, in a speech he made to\r\nthe House. It is certain that the citizens regarded him as a deadly foe.\r\nThey had not forgotten the advice he gave to Charles respecting the\r\naldermen, nor his attempt to ruin their trade by depreciation of the\r\ncoinage. For weeks past the city had been in a disordered state. On the\r\n22nd October, the mob having forced its way into the Court of High\r\nCommission, some of the offenders were brought before the mayor and\r\naldermen sitting on a commission of Oyer and Terminer; but the grand jury\r\nrefused to find a true bill. These abortive proceedings were followed by a\r\nriot at St. Paul’s.(425) Before the House had been in session a fortnight\r\nStrafford was ordered into custody.\r\n\r\n(M173)\r\n\r\nThe £50,000 which the City had advanced went but a little way towards\r\nmeeting the king’s necessities. The two armies in the north had to be\r\npaid, and there was not the wherewithal to pay them. The City was ready to\r\nlend a further sum of £25,000, on condition that the Londonderry estate\r\nwas restored, the garrison in the Tower removed and the ordnance\r\ndismounted from its walls. Unless this were done, said Cradock, \"such\r\njealousies would possess the city, it would hinder supply.\"(426)\r\nParliament agreed to the loan being repaid, as a first charge, out of the\r\n£100,000 ordered to be raised for the relief of the army and northern\r\ncounties;(427) and the Common Council lost no time in preparing a petition\r\nto parliament for the restoration of the Irish lands.(428) Nor was it only\r\nin their corporate capacity that the citizens came forward to render\r\npecuniary assistance to the government. On the 21st November Isaac\r\nPennington, alderman of the ward of Bridge Without, and one of the city’s\r\nrepresentatives in parliament, announced to the House that his\r\nconstituents had subscribed £21,000 to the loan.\r\n\r\n(M174)\r\n\r\nThe general feeling of distrust that prevailed was heightened by an attack\r\nmade upon a member of the House who, in his capacity of a justice of\r\npeace, had prepared a list of recusants, in pursuance of a recent\r\nproclamation.(429) So great was the alarm among the Commons that\r\nPennington offered the House a guard of three hundred citizens, and at\r\nfirst there was a disposition to accept the alderman’s offer, but in\r\ncourse of time better counsel prevailed and the idea was abandoned.\r\n\r\n(M175)\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the city towards Puritanism at this time was very marked.\r\nOn the 28th November Prynne and Burton entered London, and their entry was\r\nmade one long triumphal procession. This circumstance was specially noted\r\nby the royalist writer Clarendon as a remarkable \"instance of the unruly\r\nand mutinous spirit of the City of London,\" which he is pleased to term\r\n\"the sink of all the ill humour of the Kingdom.\"(430) A fortnight later\r\n(11 Dec.) a petition for church reform and the abolition of episcopacy\r\n\"root and branch\" was presented to parliament, signed by 15,000\r\nLondoners.(431) The blow was aimed at Laud, who was looked upon as the\r\ncause of all the country’s trouble. That day week (18 Dec.) the archbishop\r\nwas impeached.\r\n\r\n(M176)\r\n\r\nWhen the meetings held at Ripon between English and Scottish commissioners\r\nfor the purpose of negotiating a treaty ceased (Oct. 1640), it was on the\r\nunderstanding that they were to be resumed in London. The Scottish\r\ncommissioners accordingly came south, and were lodged in the city in a\r\nhouse adjacent to the church of St. Antholin, where they were visited by a\r\nlarge concourse of citizens and magnificently entertained.(432) It was\r\nwith no little satisfaction that the success of the Scots had been watched\r\nby the majority of the inhabitants of the city, and now that the northern\r\ncommissioners were in their midst the citizens took the opportunity of\r\nshowing them substantial marks of favour.\r\n\r\n(M177) (M178) (M179)\r\n\r\nOn the 12th January, 1641, the Scottish demands were formally submitted to\r\nparliament, but they were not taken into consideration until the 22nd.\r\nAfter much debate it was agreed in general terms that a \"friendly\r\nassistance\" should be given, leaving the amount and the manner of\r\ncollection for future consideration.(433) In the meantime the Speaker,\r\nLenthall, had written (15 Jan.) to the mayor directing him to summon a\r\nCommon Hall for the purpose of raising a loan of £60,000 required for the\r\narmy, and the Common Council had agreed (18 Jan.) that the amount should\r\nbe collected from the wards.(434) But before this could be accomplished an\r\nincident occurred which threatened to jeopardise the loan. This was the\r\nreprieve of John Goodman, a Roman Catholic priest, who had been condemned\r\nto death. The morning after parliament had agreed to raise money for the\r\nScottish commissioners alderman Pennington rose in the House and declared\r\nthat, in consequence of Goodman’s reprieve and other suspicious\r\ncircumstances, the City had resolved to lend nothing.(435) The Lords as\r\nwell as the Commons followed the initiative of the alderman and made a\r\njoint demand for the execution of the condemned priest. As he had often\r\ndone before, Charles again threw over the Catholics. He announced his\r\nintention not to allow the increase of Popery or superstition in the\r\ncountry; he would forthwith issue a proclamation commanding Jesuits and\r\npriests to leave the kingdom within a month, and he was willing to submit\r\nthe case of Goodman to the decision of both Houses.(436) Fortunately for\r\nGoodman, the City and the Commons had higher game to fly at in Strafford,\r\nand the humbler priest was allowed to remain unmolested in prison.\r\n\r\n(M180)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th February the Speaker addressed a second letter to the mayor to\r\nthe effect that the money was required sooner than it could be collected\r\nby way of subsidies, as formerly suggested to his lordship, and that\r\nconsequently the House had directed him to take steps for having £60,000\r\nraised by subscription and paid into the Chamber of London, to be at the\r\ndisposal of parliament.(437) The money not coming in so speedily as was\r\ndesired, the Speaker wrote a third time (19 Feb.) to the mayor, directing\r\nhim to summon a Common Hall and to lay before it the extreme urgency of\r\naffairs.(438) The chief cause of the delay in getting in the money was the\r\ndissatisfaction felt in the city at Strafford’s trial being put off so\r\nlong. The 17th February being at last fixed for his trial, there was some\r\nhope that the money would speedily now be forthcoming,(439) and the same\r\nday the Commons commissioned Sir William Uvedale to go to the lord mayor\r\nand get an order for receiving the money that had been collected up to\r\n£50,000.(440) Three days later the Court of Aldermen made out the\r\nnecessary order for the Chamberlain to pay over the money.(441)\r\n\r\n(M181)\r\n\r\nAgain there was delay in bringing Strafford to trial, and it was not until\r\nthe 22nd March that he was arraigned in Westminster Hall, where alone room\r\ncould be found for the crowds that were anxious to witness the\r\nproceedings. The mayor took steps to prevent a rush of people to\r\nWestminster and to suppress any riot that might arise. From five o’clock\r\nin the morning until nine at night a double watch was kept at the city’s\r\ngates and landing stages on the river. The trained bands were held in\r\nreadiness, whilst servants and apprentices were ordered to keep\r\nindoors.(442) At the end of three weeks a Bill of Attainder was brought in\r\nand read a first time (10 April), and on the 21st April it was read a\r\nthird time and passed.(443) The Lords would willingly have let matters\r\nrest here, but the discovery of a design entertained by the queen of\r\nbringing the defeated English army from the north to Westminster to\r\noverawe the parliament, and likewise of an attempt made by Charles to get\r\npossession of the Tower that he might liberate Strafford by force, hurried\r\nthe unfortunate earl’s end. The citizens were determined not to rest until\r\nhis head was off his shoulders, and 20,000 Londoners signed a petition\r\naddressed to both Houses (24 April) demanding his execution on the ground\r\nthat he had advised the plundering of the city and putting it to fine and\r\nransom.(444) The Peers deemed it advisable to give way. They passed the\r\nBill of Attainder and on the 12th May Strafford was beheaded.\r\n\r\n(M182)\r\n\r\nThe Lords had another pressing reason for giving way, for until the\r\ncitizens were assured that the full penalty of the law would be executed\r\non Strafford they determined to stop payment of the loan. Writing to\r\nMatthew Bradley on the 3rd May, the treasurer of the army tells him \"a\r\nstrange story.\" \"There is,\" he says, \"money ready in the city, but none\r\nwill be delivered until justice be done upon my lord of Strafford.\"(445)\r\nOn that very day, the letter continues, there had been a crowd of 10,000\r\nwell-to-do persons at Westminster—\"citizens of very good account, some\r\nworth £30,000, some £40,000\" demanding justice against Strafford and\r\nthreatening to send their servants the next day unless justice were\r\nspeedily executed. \"Truly these unsettled times do much trouble me.\"\r\n\r\n(M183)\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the so-called \"army plot\" had in the meanwhile led to a\r\npreamble being drawn up to a document known as the \"Protestation,\" or\r\ndeclaration in favour of the reformed religion, in which the danger from\r\nthe army was for the first time clearly mentioned. The Protestation passed\r\nthe Commons on the 3rd May,(446) and on the following day received the\r\nassent of the House of Lords. On the 11th May a printed copy of this\r\ndocument was introduced into the Court of Aldermen, when it received the\r\nwilling assent not only of the aldermen present, but also of the Town\r\nClerk and the City Remembrancer.(447) On the 29th it was accepted by the\r\nCommon Council, and two days later the mayor issued his precept for a\r\nhouse-to-house visitation to be made in every ward for the purpose of\r\ngetting all the inhabitants of the city to give in their adherence to\r\nit.(448)\r\n\r\n(M184)\r\n\r\nAlthough the execution of Strafford somewhat allayed the nation’s fears of\r\nhaving \"two armies brought into the bowels of the kingdom,\" they were soon\r\nrevived by a second army plot. The armies thus became a constant source of\r\ndanger as well as expense, and it was determined to disband them. Charles\r\ncould not withhold his assent, and a poll tax was established for the\r\npurpose of raising the necessary funds. This was in July (1641).(449) The\r\nmasters and wardens of the livery companies were forthwith called upon to\r\nmake a return in writing of the names of every person who had been and\r\nthen was master and warden of each company; the names of all the livery,\r\nyeomanry and freemen of each company, noting in the margin of the return\r\nthose who had ever been fined for alderman or sheriff, and the parish and\r\nward in which each individual member of the company resided. Every\r\nalderman was likewise instructed to make a return of the names of his\r\ndeputy and common councilmen of his ward; the names of every\r\nmerchant-stranger that kept house there, every English merchant and\r\nfactor, and every popish recusant; and finally the names of everyone in\r\nthe ward above the age of sixteen years not otherwise rated.(450)\r\n\r\n(M185)\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd February the House had come to a resolution that the sum of\r\n£300,000 might justly be appointed as a \"friendly assistance and relief\"\r\nfor the Scots. The manner in which it was to be raised was left for\r\nfurther consideration.(451) It was now arranged that £80,000 of that sum\r\nshould be at once paid over to them, and that on August the 25th they\r\nshould cross the Tweed. The City was called upon to find £40,000—or\r\none-half of the amount immediately required—by Wednesday, the 28th\r\nJuly.(452) By order of the House of Commons (29 July) it was to be repaid\r\nwith interest out of the poll money when levied.(453) So eager were the\r\ncitizens to contribute towards the work of ridding the country of the\r\nScottish forces before Charles should have an opportunity of using his\r\npowers of persuasion upon them that there was a difficulty in getting a\r\nsufficient number of tellers to receive it.(454)\r\n\r\n(M186)\r\n\r\nIn addition to this heavy drain upon their resources, the citizens were\r\ncalled upon by the House of Commons (31 July) to forthwith pay the sum of\r\n£3,000 which they had undertaken to advance, upon the public faith of the\r\nHouse, towards \"the furnishing of the queen-mother of France in her\r\njourney out of the kingdom.\"(455) Ever since October, 1638, Mary de\r\nMedicis had resided at St. James’s Palace, and had caused no little\r\ndiscontent by her intermeddling in the affairs of the country and the\r\nfavour she displayed towards Catholics. On her first arrival in London the\r\ncitizens had accorded her a hearty welcome.(456) The acknowledgment that\r\nCharles subsequently made of his gratification at the City’s action on\r\nthis occasion was rendered somewhat ungracious by his requesting that a\r\ngift of the value of £1,000, \"or thereabouts,\" should be made to the\r\nqueen-mother in further demonstration of the City’s love. After\r\ncommunicating with the Common Council the Court of Aldermen agreed to\r\npresent her with a cup of the value of £800, \"or thereabouts.\"(457)\r\n\r\n(M187)\r\n\r\nCharles had determined to set out for Scotland on Monday, the 9th August,\r\nin spite of every effort to get him to postpone his journey. So great\r\nindeed was the fear of danger likely to be incurred if he carried out his\r\nintention at this juncture that the House of Commons determined to sit on\r\nSunday to contrive measures for avoiding the threatened risk—a proceeding\r\nwhich they publicly declared they would never have adopted, \"but upon\r\ninevitable necessity, the peace and safety both of Church and State being\r\nso deeply concerned.\"(458) In answer to a fresh appeal Charles consented\r\nto put off his journey for one day, and on Tuesday (10 Aug.)—the day on\r\nwhich the treaty with the Scots was finished and the queen-mother left\r\nEngland—he set out for Scotland.\r\n\r\n(M188) (M189)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th August, when all danger in the north appeared to have passed\r\naway and Charles had visited both armies without appealing to them for\r\nassistance, parliament decided to adjourn from the 8th September until the\r\n20th October. The Commons were in need of rest after the excitement of the\r\nsession, and the necessity for an adjournment was increased by another\r\nvisitation of the plague,(459) which had already driven many members home\r\nwithout leave. The day preceding the adjournment was appointed to be kept\r\nas a day of thanksgiving for the peace; and, pursuant to an order of both\r\nHouses, the mayor issued his precept for shops to be closed and for the\r\ninhabitants of the city to attend divine service, after which bells were\r\nto be rung and bonfires lighted.(460)\r\n\r\n(M190)\r\n\r\nBefore the Commons separated they delivered (26 Aug.) their judgment upon\r\na petition(461) which the City had prepared for them in January touching\r\nits estate in Londonderry, of which it had been deprived in 1635 by\r\nsentence of the Court of Star Chamber. That petition set forth the\r\nunwillingness of the City to undertake the work of the Ulster plantation.\r\nIt had only been undertaken at the late king’s earnest desire, and subject\r\nto special articles, the City absolutely refusing to be bound by the\r\ngeneral articles drawn up by his majesty for ordinary undertakers. The\r\nIrish Society and the companies had expended more than £130,000 (exclusive\r\nof money laid out by tenants) on their estate \"in hope to have in the\r\nfuture enjoyed some benefitt of their great cost and charge.\" The city of\r\nLondonderry and the town of Coleraine had been rebuilt, and the castle of\r\nCulmore repaired and entrenched. Fifteen churches had been either built or\r\nrepaired, besides a \"very fair\" church and free school which had been\r\nerected in Derry at a cost of more than £4,000. Roads had been made which\r\nhad converted one of the most barbarous places in the kingdom into one of\r\nthe most civilised. The society and the companies, the petition went on to\r\nsay, had enjoyed this estate without interruption until Hilary Term a° 6\r\nCharles I (1631), when the Attorney-General, Sir Robert Heath, exhibited\r\nan information against the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London and\r\ndivers individuals, suggesting that they had possessed themselves of the\r\nsaid lands and taken the profits before any grant was made to them, and\r\nthat they had a greater quantity of lands than was intended to be passed\r\nby the grant, and had by indirect means procured divers privileges to be\r\ninserted in the grant for which the Attorney General who passed the grant\r\nhad no warrant. Evidence of witnesses had been taken on the matter, but\r\nbefore the cause came to a hearing this information was dropt and another\r\nexhibited in Hilary Term a° 8 Charles I (1633) against the petitioners and\r\nthe Irish Society, in which new charges touching infringement of\r\nconditions of Letters Patent were inserted, and upon these pretences the\r\nIrish Society was adjudged by sentence of the Court of Star Chamber in\r\nHilary Term a° 10 Charles I (1635) to pay a fine of £70,000 and to lose\r\ntheir estate on the ground that the said Letters Patent had been \"unduly\r\nand surreptitiously obteyned to the prejudice and deceipt of his\r\nmajestie.\" The companies refused to surrender their estates, and divers\r\nlands belonging to the City and to the Bridgehouse were seized to satisfy\r\nthe fine, to the great prejudice of the City. Being otherwise unable to\r\nredeem themselves from the penalty of the Star Chamber sentence, the\r\ncompanies were forced to consent to relinquish their Irish estate and all\r\narrears of rent, amounting to £20,000. A _scire facias_ was brought in and\r\njudgment allowed by default, whereupon the companies lost their estates,\r\nwhilst the mayor and commonalty and citizens of London, although not\r\nparties to any patent or plantation—having done no more than lend their\r\nname for the better transaction of the business and for the purpose of\r\nraising money for the plantation, which otherwise could never have been\r\neffected—were fined £70,000. Seeing that the matter reflected so badly\r\nupon the justice of the late as well as the present king, the petitioners\r\nhumbly prayed that a full investigation of the whole proceedings might be\r\nmade and justice done.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the petition which the Common Council ordered in\r\nJanuary (1641) to be submitted to parliament. The House had its hands too\r\nfull to pay much attention to the City’s grievance until recently; but\r\nnow, within a fortnight of their adjournment for a well-earned rest, the\r\nCommons declared(462) the sentence in the Star Chamber to have been\r\nunlawful and unjust. They declared that, in the opinion of the House, the\r\ncitizens of London had been solicited and pressed to undertake the\r\nplantation of Londonderry, that the king had not been deceived in the\r\ngrant to the new corporation of the Irish Society, that no breach of\r\ncovenant (if any there were) had been committed sufficient to cause a\r\nforfeiture of the lands, that the Star Chamber proceedings were _ultra\r\nvires_, and that the citizens of London and all those against whom\r\njudgment had been given in the _scire facias_ should be discharged of that\r\njudgment and reinstated as they were before the sentence in the Star\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n(M191)\r\n\r\nBefore the Houses again met, Richard Gurney, a man of the same royalist\r\nproclivity as Garway, and on that account, perhaps, described by Clarendon\r\nas \"a man of wisdom and courage,\" had been elected mayor in succession to\r\nEdmund Wright.(463) The last days of Wright’s mayoralty were days of\r\nsickness and tumult in the city. Numbers of disbanded soldiers from the\r\nnorth had made their way to London, where they carried on a system of\r\nrapine and outrage. The mayor issued precepts for search to be made in\r\nevery ward for suspected persons and disbanded soldiers, as well as for\r\nkeeping the streets well lighted at night by candle and lanthorn, whilst\r\npublic proclamation was made by the king for soldiers to repair to their\r\nown homes.(464)\r\n\r\n(M192)\r\n\r\nShortly after the House of Commons had resumed its session attention was\r\nagain drawn towards Ireland, where a rebellion had broken out. Seeing how\r\nsuccessful Scotland had been in its resistance to England, the Irish had\r\ndetermined to strike a blow for the recovery of lands handed over to\r\nProtestant colonists, as well as for religious liberty. Charles himself\r\nhad held out hopes of greater freedom to the Irish Catholics, who saw no\r\nreason why they should be worse treated than the rebellious Puritans of\r\nScotland. The scene of massacre and cruelty which followed has been\r\ndescribed by others, and remains to this day (in the words of Carlyle) \"a\r\nhuge blot, an indiscriminate blackness, one which the human memory cannot\r\nwillingly charge itself with.\"\r\n\r\n(M193)\r\n\r\nAs soon as news of the outbreak reached parliament, application was\r\nforthwith made to the City for assistance. On the 3rd November lord mayor\r\nGurney issued his precept(465) to the aldermen informing them that on the\r\nprevious day divers lords and others of both Houses of Parliament had come\r\nto the Common Council and asked for a loan of £50,000 at eight per cent.\r\nSeeing that the matter was of so great importance, each alderman was\r\ndesired to take steps in conjunction with his deputy and common councilmen\r\nof his ward to get liberal contributions made towards the loan.(466)\r\n\r\n(M194)\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the City now became more marked. Whilst consenting to find\r\nthe money required, it asked parliament that the persons of the Catholic\r\nlords might be secured, and that the bishops, who were the cause of every\r\ngood measure being defeated in the Upper House, might be deprived of their\r\nvotes. It had a minor grievance in the custom that had arisen of members\r\nof both Houses granting their servants \"protections\" against creditors, a\r\nprocedure extremely prejudicial to the city merchant and tradesman, and\r\none which they would willingly see remedied.(467)\r\n\r\n(M195)\r\n\r\nThe City’s declaration against the bishops, which Dr. Gardiner(468)\r\ncharacterises as being \"the turning point in the struggle,\" augured badly\r\nfor Charles. Nevertheless, he had friends in the city. The new mayor was a\r\nstrong royalist, as also were the majority of the aldermen, and they took\r\nthe opportunity of Charles paying his first visit to the city (25 Nov.)\r\nsince he ascended the throne to demonstrate their loyalty. On the 17th the\r\nCourt of Aldermen appointed a committee to make the necessary\r\narrangements,(469) whilst the mayor issued his precept the same day to the\r\ncivic companies to prepare a certain number of their livery, well horsed\r\nand apparelled, to assist him in escorting the king and queen from the\r\nchurch of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, to the Guildhall on the morning of the\r\neventful day, and thence, after the banquet, to Whitehall.(470) The Common\r\nCouncil agreed that the cost of the entertainment at the Guildhall should\r\nbe defrayed by the Chamber.(471)\r\n\r\n(M196)\r\n\r\nOn the king’s approaching the northern suburbs of the city, whither the\r\nmayor and citizens had gone to meet him,(472) he was welcomed by the\r\nRecorder. There was some talk of presenting the king with a gift either of\r\nmoney or plate,(473) but the proposal fell through. \"We tender to you,\"\r\nsaid Sir Thomas Gardiner, \"no formal present; it would but lessen us; I am\r\nsure whatever it were it would be far short of our meaning.\"\r\n\r\n(M197)\r\n\r\nIt was of the utmost importance to Charles to win over the city to his\r\nside if he could—\"The loans of the London citizens alone had made it\r\npossible for the House of Commons to disband the armies; and without the\r\nloans of the London citizens the House would find it impossible to provide\r\nfor a campaign in Ireland,\" and thus place itself in a position of\r\nmilitary supremacy.(474) Accordingly, in a speech carefully prepared\r\nbeforehand,(475) he expressed his gratification at finding that the better\r\nclass of citizens were still loyal. \"I see,\" said he, \"that all those\r\nformer tumults and disorders have only risen from the meaner sort of\r\npeople, and that the affections of the better and main part of the city\r\nhave ever been loyal and affectionate to my person and government.\" He\r\nproceeded to assure his hearers of his determination to maintain the true\r\nProtestant religion as established by Elizabeth and James, and he hoped\r\nwith the assistance of parliament to re-establish the trade of the\r\ncountry. But what pleased the citizens perhaps more than anything was a\r\npromise he made to restore to them their Londonderry estate—at that moment\r\nin the hands of the rebels, but soon, he hoped, to be recovered. The\r\nRecorder was expressly commanded to wait upon his majesty and see that\r\nthis promise was punctually performed.(476)\r\n\r\n(M198)\r\n\r\nBy way of further showing his favour Charles knighted both the Mayor and\r\nRecorder on the spot. He afterwards expressed his gratification at the\r\nreception that the City had accorded him,(477) and conferred knighthoods\r\nupon both of the sheriffs and five of the aldermen.(478)\r\n\r\n(M199)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council took Charles at his word and lost no time in appointing\r\na committee for the purpose of introducing a Bill in parliament for the\r\nrecovery of the city’s Irish estate. The Recorder had pointed out (20\r\nNov.) to the court that the \"corporation\" (_i.e._ the Irish society) had\r\nbeen dissolved, and it behoved them to consider in whose names the Irish\r\nestate should be vested, whether in the name of the mayor and commonalty\r\nof London or a \"select company.\"\r\n\r\n(M200)\r\n\r\nThe disaffected element in the city, which had voluntarily kept itself in\r\nthe background, or had been suppressed by force on the day of the king’s\r\nvisit, again came to the surface as soon as the duties of hospitality had\r\nbeen executed. Once more a crowd gathered (29 Nov.) at Westminster,\r\nshouting \"No bishops!\" encouraged (it was said) by John Venn, a merchant\r\ntaylor, who had succeeded Cradock, on the latter’s decease, as one of the\r\ncity’s representatives in parliament. On the 10th December the mayor,\r\nacting under orders from the king, issued his precept to the aldermen to\r\nsee that apprentices and servants were kept within doors and not allowed\r\nto go abroad to make tumult and hold unlawful meetings.(479)\r\n\r\n(M201)\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion existed as to the representative character of\r\nthose who had thus threatened parliament. \"You much mistake,\" wrote Thomas\r\nWiseman to Sir John Pennington ten days after the riot had taken place,\r\n\"if you think those seditious meetings of sectaries and others ill\r\naffected, who have lately been at the parliament-house to cry for justice\r\nagainst the delinquent bishops, are the representative body of the\r\ncity—they are not, but the representative body is the lord mayor, aldermen\r\nand Common Council, who gave the entertainment to the king and will stick\r\nto him and live and die in his service.\"(480)\r\n\r\n(M202)\r\n\r\nIn order to dispel all doubts as to the respectability of the agitators\r\nthey determined to present a formal petition to parliament for the removal\r\nof the bishops, and to do the thing in style. \"Accoutred in the best\r\nmanner they could,\" they rode to Westminster in coaches, \"to prevent the\r\naspersion that they were of the basest sort of people only which were that\r\nway affected.\"(481) They declared that the petition was signed by over\r\n20,000 well-to-do citizens, including aldermen and members of the Common\r\nCouncil, and that many more signatures might have been obtained but for\r\nthe obstruction of divers \"ill-affected persons.\"(482) When the Commons\r\ncame to inquire (20 Dec.) who these ill-affected persons were, it was\r\nfound that the Mayor and the Recorder were the chief. The former was\r\ndeclared to have said that the petition had found favour only with\r\nignorant or idle people, who did not realise the danger they were in, and\r\nthat the petition \"tended to mutiny.\" On hearing that part of the petition\r\nwhich stated that it was the wish of the \"representative body\" of the city\r\nto have the bishops removed, the Recorder lost all control over himself,\r\nand swore it was a lie. The petition, he said, tended to sedition, and to\r\nset men together by the ears. So far from tending to peace it was, he\r\ndeclared, \"for blood and cutting of throats; and if it came to cutting of\r\nthroats, thank yourselves; and your blood be upon your own heads.\"(483)\r\n\r\n(M203)\r\n\r\nThe following day was the Feast of St. Thomas (21 Dec.), the day on which\r\nthe members of the Common Council go out of office and present themselves\r\nto their constituents for re-election. The result of the elections turned\r\nout to be largely in favour of the Puritan opposition. The new Common\r\nCouncil, like the House of Commons, would support \"King Pym\" and his\r\npolicy; whilst the more aristocratic Court of Aldermen would side with\r\nCharles and the House of Lords.(484) It cannot be doubted that the new\r\ncouncil was more truly representative of the inhabitants of the city, and\r\nbetter able to give expression to their wishes than the last. There was\r\nonly wanting a popular lord mayor. He was to come.\r\n\r\n(M204) (M205)\r\n\r\nThe tardy and unsatisfactory reply Charles gave to the remonstrance—the\r\n\"Grand Remonstrance of the state of the Church and Kingdom\" presented to\r\nhim at Hampton Court on the 1st December—and his appointment of Colonel\r\nLunsford, a debauched ruffian, as lieutenant of the Tower, in place of\r\nBalfour, who was a favourite with the city, increased the exasperation\r\nagainst him, and the mayor was obliged to inform him (26 Dec.) that unless\r\nLunsford was removed he could not answer for the peace of the city. This\r\nrepresentation by Gurney had the desired effect, and Lunsford was removed\r\nthat night.(485) Before his removal became generally known another riot\r\nbroke out at Westminster (27 Dec.) between London apprentices and some\r\nofficers of the late army, among whom was Lunsford himself. The officers\r\ndrew their swords and drove the close-cropt apprentices, or \"roundheads\"\r\nas they were jeeringly called, out of Westminster, chasing them up King\r\nStreet as far as Whitehall. Several of the rioters were hurt, but none\r\nkilled. For some days the excitement was so great that everyone attending\r\nthe court at Whitehall wore a sword; and 500 gentlemen of the Inns of\r\nCourt offered their services to the king.(486) On the 28th December\r\nCharles directed the mayor to call out the trained bands, and to command\r\ntheir officers, \"by shooting with bullets or otherwise,\" to slay and kill\r\nsuch as should persist in tumultuary and seditious ways and\r\ndisorders.(487) The Peers were inclined to throw the blame of the\r\ndisturbance upon the civic authorities, but Pym and the House of Commons\r\nrefused \"to discontent the citizens of London, our surest friends,\" at\r\nsuch a critical time.(488) Charles himself took the same view, and sent a\r\nletter to the City by the hand of Lord Newburgh, in which he expressed his\r\ncontinued confidence in the loyalty of the city, and ascribed the recent\r\ntumults and distempers to \"the meane and unruly people of the suburbs.\"\r\nThe Common Council in reply caused it to be signified to his majesty that\r\nneither that court nor any individual member of it was implicated in the\r\nlate disorder, which they altogether disavowed and disclaimed.(489) Having\r\ncommitted this message to Lord Newburgh to carry to the king, the court\r\nproceeded to take measures for the better preserving the peace in the\r\nseveral wards of the city.\r\n\r\n(M206)\r\n\r\nThe same day that these measures were being taken for public safety in the\r\ncity the Commons directed halberds to be brought into the House for their\r\nown use in case of a sudden attack, and desired the king to appoint the\r\nEarl of Essex captain of the guard. After this they adjourned until the\r\n3rd January, a committee being ordered to sit in the meanwhile at the\r\nGuildhall. Upon the re-assembling of the House Charles refused its request\r\nfor a guard.(490) The Commons thereupon sent a message to the mayor for\r\nthe trained bands to be put in readiness \"for the safety of the king’s\r\nperson, the city and the commonwealth,\" and for good and strong watches to\r\nbe set at all places convenient about the city. The following day Sir\r\nThomas Soame, Alderman Pennington and Captain Venn were despatched to the\r\ncity to inform the citizens of a new danger which was threatening the\r\nCommons.(491)\r\n\r\n(M207)\r\n\r\nDuring the short recess Charles had at last made up his mind to a course\r\nlong premeditated. He determined to seize the parliamentary leaders on a\r\ncharge of treason, and articles of impeachment were drawn up against Lord\r\nKimbolton, of the House of Peers, and Pym, Hampden, Holles, Hazlerigg and\r\nStrode, of the Commons. No sooner had the Commons met than the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms appeared with orders to arrest the five members.(492) As\r\nsuch action affected the privileges of the House, a committee was\r\nappointed to send a reply to the king in due course. Baffled in this\r\ndirection, the king despatched a message to the lord mayor forbidding him\r\nto call out the trained bands at the order of the Commons, but only to\r\nraise such a force as might be necessary to put down tumult and\r\ndisorder.(493) Gurney was in bed at the time, but he promised to see to it\r\nin the morning.(494)\r\n\r\n(M208)\r\n\r\nWhen the Commons met the next morning (4 Jan.) they sent up the articles\r\nof impeachment to the House of Lords as a scandalous paper. The king in\r\nthe meantime was taking steps to secure the Tower and the city. He had\r\nheard that six pieces of ordnance had been removed from the artillery yard\r\nand placed near the Leadenhall, and he wrote to the mayor bidding him see\r\nthat they were used only for the guard and preservation of the city if\r\nneed be.(495) It was these measures that caused the Commons to send Soame,\r\nPennington and Venn to the city to inform the citizens of the impending\r\ndanger. On the afternoon of the same day Charles himself appeared in the\r\nHouse, to the door of which he had been accompanied by an armed retinue.\r\nTaking his stand before the Speaker’s chair he professed sorrow for the\r\nnecessity that had brought him there. Yesterday he had sent, he said, a\r\nSergeant-at-Arms to apprehend certain persons accused of high treason. He\r\nhad expected obedience and not an answer. Careful as he was and always\r\nwould be of the privileges of the Commons, they were to know that there\r\nwas no privilege in matters of treason. Failing himself to discover those\r\nwhom he sought, he turned to Lenthall and asked him if they were in the\r\nHouse. \"Do you see any of them?\" The Speaker’s reply was singularly apt.\r\n\"May it please your majesty,\" said he, falling on his knee before Charles,\r\n\"I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this\r\nHouse is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\" Casting one more\r\nglance round the House, and finding that the \"birds had flown,\" the king\r\nwithdrew amid cries of \"Privilege! Privilege!\" and the House immediately\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\n(M209)\r\n\r\nThe king could not allow matters to rest here. The next morning, being\r\nWednesday, the 5th January, he set out for the city with a small retinue,\r\nand presented himself at the Guildhall when a Court of Common Council was\r\nsitting. The city’s archives are searched in vain for any record of what\r\ntook place on that memorable occasion, but we have a vivid account of the\r\nscene handed down to us by an eye-witness, Captain Slingsby, who,\r\nhappening to meet the royal party on its way to the city, turned back and\r\nfollowed it into the precincts of the Council Chamber.(496) Charles lost\r\nno time in coming to the point. He had come, he said, to demand those\r\npersons who had been already accused of high treason, and who were\r\nbelieved at that moment to be lurking within the city. He desired to bring\r\nthem to a trial at law, and depended upon those present for their\r\nassistance. He was resolved to redress grievances and to preserve the\r\nprivileges of parliament, but he must \"question these traitors.\" After\r\njustifying the existence of a guard at Whitehall and saying a few friendly\r\nwords to the aldermen, he invited himself to dinner with one of the\r\nsheriffs, choosing the sheriff who was less favourably disposed towards\r\nhim, viz., sheriff Garrett. The king’s speech was followed by an ominous\r\npause. Then a cry, writes Slingsby, was raised in the council,\r\n\"Parliament! Privileges of parliament!\" and presently another, \"God bless\r\nthe king!\" These continued for some time, but he professes to be unable to\r\nsay which of the two was loudest. When silence was restored the king asked\r\nthat a spokesman should make known to him their wishes. Thereupon a member\r\nof the council arose and said, \"It is the vote of this court that your\r\nmajesty hear the advice of your parliament.\" This statement was at once\r\nchallenged by another, who cried out, \"It is not the vote of this court:\r\nit is your own vote.\" The king replied by asking who it was that charged\r\nhim with not taking the advice of his parliament, adding that he did take\r\nits advice and would continue to do so, but, said he, \"I must distinguish\r\nbetween the parliament and some traitors in it,\" and these, he repeated,\r\n\"he would bring to trial—to trial.\" \"No privileges could protect a traitor\r\nfrom a trial.\" With this he turned to leave the Council Chamber. On\r\nreaching the outer hall he was again assailed with the cry that had been\r\nmade to ring in his ears all the way from Whitehall to the city, \"The\r\nprivileges of parliament!\" Undaunted he made his way through the mob to\r\ndine at Garrett’s house, and later in the day, amid the same cries, he\r\nreturned to Whitehall.\r\n\r\n(M210)\r\n\r\nRelieved of his presence, the Common Council, with great deliberation,\r\nagreed on the terms of a petition to be presented to his majesty.(497)\r\nAfter expressing their regret for the continuation of the rebellion in\r\nIreland, the removal of the lieutenant of the Tower, in whom all had\r\nconfidence, the steps taken to fortify Whitehall, and the recent\r\ndisturbances at Westminster, they represented to the king the great\r\nincrease of the fears of the citizens owing to his attempt to seize the\r\nfive members, the effect of which was to prejudice the whole trade of the\r\ncity and the kingdom. They therefore humbly desired him to take steps for\r\nthe speedy relief of the Protestants in Ireland, to place the Tower in the\r\nhands of persons of trust, to remove discredited persons from Whitehall\r\nand Westminster, and not to proceed against Lord Kimbolton and the five\r\nmembers of the Commons otherwise than in accordance with the privileges of\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n(M211)\r\n\r\nHaving ordered this petition to be engrossed and afterwards to be\r\npresented to his majesty, the Common Council proceeded to vote a sum of\r\n£2,000 for the purpose of providing a stock of arms and ammunition for the\r\ndefence of the city in \"theis tymes of daungers and feares.\"\r\n\r\n(M212)\r\n\r\nEach alderman had already been directed to see that the trained bands,\r\n6,000 strong, were fully equipt without the necessity of borrowing arms\r\nfrom the city halls or elsewhere; a double watch with halberds and muskets\r\nwas ordered to be kept in each ward by night and day, chains and posts\r\nwhich were in any way defective were to be forthwith made good, and hooks,\r\nladders, buckets, spades, shovels, pickaxes, augers and chisels were to be\r\nkept in readiness in case of fire.(498) Members of the Common Council were\r\nforbidden on the 6th January to leave their wards without express\r\npermission.(499) The same night an alarm was raised, and the mayor was\r\nasked to call out the trained bands. On his refusal the trained bands\r\ndispensed with his authority and turned out on their own account. The\r\npanic quickly spread, and every inhabitant, arming himself as best he\r\ncould, hastened to join them. In course of time the alarm subsided, but\r\nthe mayor was commanded by an Order in Council (8 Jan.) to investigate the\r\ncause of the alarm, and to secure the persons who had taken upon\r\nthemselves to call out the trained bands.(500) This Order in Council was\r\nimmediately met by a resolution of the Grand Committee of the Commons\r\nsitting at Grocers’ Hall to the effect that the action of the citizens for\r\nthe defence of parliament had been in accordance with their duty, and that\r\nanyone attempting to arrest them for so doing was a public enemy. More\r\nthan this, the Committee declared that at a time when the king, kingdom\r\nand parliament were \"in very eminent and apparent danger,\" it was the duty\r\nof the lord mayor, aldermen and Common Council, or the greater number of\r\nthem, to make use of the trained bands or any other forces of the city for\r\nthe preservation of the peace.(501)\r\n\r\n(M213)\r\n\r\nOn the same day (8 Jan.) the king’s reply to the City’s late petition was\r\nread before the Common Council.(502) He had hoped, he said, to have\r\nalready satisfied most of the objections raised in the petition by his\r\nspeech to the citizens on the previous Wednesday; nevertheless, he was\r\nwilling to give a further answer to the several matters objected to, being\r\npersuaded that his so doing would be considered the greatest proof that he\r\ncould offer of his good intention. His answer, however, in whatever terms\r\nit was couched, was considered far from satisfactory to the council, and\r\npreparations for resisting force by force began to be pushed on.\r\n\r\n(M214)\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 10th January, a joint agreement for the future defence of\r\nparliament and the city was arrived at by the committee of parliament and\r\na committee appointed by the Common Council.(503) The trained bands were\r\nordered to their colours and placed under the command of Captain Philip\r\nSkippon, as sergeant-major-general of the forces of the city. Eight pieces\r\nof ordnance were to accompany the troops, and as many citizens as could\r\nsupply themselves with horses were to serve on horseback. All this was\r\ndone for the safety of the \"king, parliament and kingdom.\" With the object\r\nof increasing the number of trained bands, the mayor was authorised by the\r\nCommon Council (19 Jan.) to issue his precept for a return to be made by\r\nthe alderman of each ward (1) of the number of men in his ward fit to find\r\nand bear arms, and (2) the number of men fit to bear arms but unable to\r\nfind them.(504) The Common Council agreed to pay Skippon £300 a year for\r\nlife, if he should so long continue in the city’s service.(505) Guns and\r\nammunition were stored up at the Leadenhall,(506) and a supply of corn\r\nlaid in by the livery companies.(507)\r\n\r\n(M215)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Charles committed the fatal mistake of quitting London\r\n(10 Jan.), and parliament had thereupon returned to Westminster (11 Jan.).\r\nThe appearance of the five members as they made their way by water from\r\nthe city to Westminster was greeted with shouts of joy and firing of\r\nvolleys. On entering the House they publicly acknowledged the kindness\r\nextended to them by the City, for which the sheriffs and the citizens\r\nreceived the thanks of the Commons, and a promise of indemnity for their\r\naction throughout the recent crisis.(508)\r\n\r\n(M216)\r\n\r\nEverything now promised well for parliament except the refusal of Sir John\r\nByron, lieutenant of the Tower, to submit to its orders. Once more the\r\nseamen or mariners of London, who play no unimportant part in the history\r\nof the city at political crises, came forward. They offered to take the\r\nTower by assault. There was some talk of reducing the fortress by\r\nstarvation, and Byron confessed to secretary Nicholas (22 Jan.)(509) that\r\nif the measures had been carried out he could not long have held the\r\nplace, determined as he was to sell both the Tower and his life at as dear\r\na rate as he could. No such strict investment, however, took place.\r\nSkippon attempted to win over a portion of the garrison in the absence of\r\nthe lieutenant, but failed. The Tower, however, became less an object of\r\nfear to the citizens as its stock of munition of war became less every day\r\nby reason of shipments to Ireland.\r\n\r\n(M217)\r\n\r\nIt was to Ireland that Charles looked for assistance in his struggle with\r\nparliament. It behoved the latter, therefore, to use its utmost endeavours\r\nto reduce that country to subjection. A deputation from the House waited\r\non the Common Council (22 Jan.) with a request for a loan of £100,000.\r\nWhilst this request was under consideration the mayor was directed by the\r\ncouncil to write to all the livery companies interested in the Londonderry\r\nestate, and exhort them to contribute bread and corn for the relief of the\r\nplantation.(510)\r\n\r\n(M218)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (24 Jan.) the City resolved not to accede to the request.\r\nAnswer was sent that they were unable to raise money for a foreign war by\r\nway of a tax, and it was hopeless to raise the money by voluntary\r\ncontributions. The House was reminded that the City had already advanced a\r\nsum of £50,000 on the express understanding that troops should forthwith\r\nbe despatched to Ireland, but none had gone. The citizens would refuse to\r\nlend more until assured that relief had been actually sent to Londonderry.\r\nThe House was further reminded that the City was dissatisfied with the\r\nremissness shown in disarming Papists and pressing of soldiers, as well as\r\nin displacing the lieutenant of the Tower, and appointing one well\r\napproved by parliament. A similar representation was made to the House of\r\nLords.(511)\r\n\r\n(M219)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th February a petition was presented to the House of Commons by\r\n\"divers of his majesty’s loyal subjects,\" offering to assist at their own\r\ncharge in putting down the Irish rebellion, provided that they might have\r\nsuch satisfaction out of the rebels’ estates as should be thought\r\nreasonable.(512) The suggestion was readily accepted, and a scheme for\r\nopening a public subscription passed through both Houses in a week. The\r\nmayor lost no time in setting a subscription on foot in the city.(513) The\r\ncompanies, to whom application had been made a month before for\r\ncontributions of bread and corn, were now desirous to know if they could\r\nlimit their relief to those sufferers on what was or had been their own\r\nestates in Ireland, and not have it distributed among all his majesty’s\r\ndistressed subjects in that country. The Common Council declined to\r\nundertake to answer this question, but recommended each company to appear\r\nbefore the parliamentary committee appointed for the purpose and make its\r\nown conditions.(514)\r\n\r\nThe following day (3 March) the City was informed that an Act of\r\nParliament was already in preparation for settling 2,500,000 acres of land\r\naccording to the votes of both Houses, unto which his majesty had given\r\nhis royal assent.(515) The companies were subsequently (19th March)\r\ninvited to provide ordnance for the protection of Londonderry.(516)\r\n\r\n(M220)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the struggle that had been going on between the king and\r\nparliament as to who should have control over the fortresses and the\r\ntrained bands or militia of the kingdom, resulted in the Commons drawing\r\nup an ordinance conferring power in each county upon persons, to be\r\nafterwards named, to raise an armed force for the suppression of\r\nrebellions and invasions (31 Jan.).(517) This \"militia ordinance\"—as it\r\nwas called—caused no little dissatisfaction in the city as trespassing\r\nupon the authority of the lord mayor, and a petition against it was drawn\r\nup by a certain section of the inhabitants and presented to both Houses of\r\nParliament. The same was printed and circulated together with the king’s\r\nmessage to the Houses against the ordinance.(518)\r\n\r\n(M221)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council were determined, however, to stand by parliament. They\r\npassed a resolution disclaiming the petition against the militia\r\nordinance, and ordered other petitions to be drawn up and presented to\r\nboth Houses,(519) congratulating them on the steps they had taken \"for the\r\nsafety of his majesty, the parliament and the kingdom,\" which would meet\r\nwith ready submission on the part of the petitioners, and thanking them\r\nfor the honour they had done the City in allowing it to nominate those\r\npersons to whom its militia should be committed.(520) Gurney, the royalist\r\nmayor, did not preside at the court which sanctioned these petitions,\r\nbeing absent from illness, so it was said.\r\n\r\n(M222)\r\n\r\nOn the 4th April a militia commission appointed by parliament for the city\r\nwas read before the Common Council, the commissioners being authorised to\r\nraise and train forces, appoint and remove officers, and do other things\r\nnecessary for the suppressing of rebellions and resisting invasions.(521)\r\nIt was suggested that six colonels and thirty-four captains should be set\r\nover the trained bands, which had been recently increased to forty\r\ncompanies, each 200 strong.(522) The pay of the officers was guaranteed by\r\nthe Common Council.(523) A stock of gunpowder was laid up in the city\r\nready for any emergency, and the livery companies were called upon to make\r\na return of the arms stored in their several halls.(524)\r\n\r\n(M223)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May a grand review of all the trained bands of the city, with\r\ntheir new officer Skippon at their head, was held in Finsbury Fields in\r\nthe presence of both Houses of Parliament, the members of which were\r\nhospitably entertained on the ground at the City’s expense.(525)\r\n\r\n(M224)\r\n\r\nSo pleased was parliament—both Lords and Commons—at the zeal of the City\r\nin raising and training so large a force as 8,000 men, to serve as an\r\nexample (it was hoped) to the rest of the kingdom, as also in contributing\r\nupwards of £40,000 (more than one-tenth part of the whole sum recently\r\nvoted by parliament) for the defence of the kingdom, that a deputation\r\nfrom both houses waited on the Common Council (16 May) and returned their\r\nhearty thanks.(526)\r\n\r\n(M225)\r\n\r\nOn the following day (17 May) the Houses resolved that Skippon should\r\nignore an order from the king to attend his majesty at York, and directed\r\nthe sheriffs to suppress any levy of men made without the major-general’s\r\nauthority.(527)\r\n\r\n(M226)\r\n\r\nIt was no long time before application was again made to the city for more\r\npecuniary assistance. The breach between king and parliament was rapidly\r\nwidening. Charles was known to be collecting forces around him in spite of\r\na formal prohibition by the Commons, who now more distinctly asserted\r\ntheir claim to sovereignty. On Thursday, the 2nd June, a deputation of\r\nLords and Commons presented themselves before the livery of the several\r\ncompanies assembled in Common Hall, and desired a loan of £100,000 towards\r\n\"the relief and preservation of the kingdom of Ireland\" and \"speedy supply\r\nof the great and urgent necessities of this kingdom.\" The money was voted\r\n\"most freely and with great alacrity,\" and was to be raised by the\r\ncompanies according to their corn assessment, as on previous occasions. On\r\nthe 4th June the Commons passed an ordinance for security of the loan, and\r\nthe thanks of both Houses and of the whole kingdom were returned to the\r\ncity for its ready compliance.(528) Two days later (6 June) Gurney, much\r\nagainst his own inclination we may be sure, was forced to issue his\r\nprecept to the companies to raise their several contributions.(529) The\r\nGrocers’ Company raised their quota of £9,000 by voluntary subscription\r\nwithout demur. The Merchant Taylors, on the other hand, who were assessed\r\nat £10,000, whilst expressing themselves ready to do their part in\r\nfurnishing the loan, took occasion to formally place on record their\r\nresolution \"that the Common Hall (consisting of the liveries of this city)\r\nassembled in the Guildhall, London, hath no power, right or authority to\r\nbind or impose upon this company any loan of money whatsoever.\"(530)\r\n\r\n(M227) (M228)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th the Commons issued \"propositions\" for the bringing in of\r\nmoney, plate, arms and horses for \"the defence of the king and both houses\r\nof parliament.\" Those living in and around London within a radius of\r\neighty miles were allowed a fortnight; and so great was the enthusiasm\r\ndisplayed for the parliamentary cause that (in the words of\r\nClarendon)(531) \"it is hardly credible what a vast proportion of plate was\r\nbrought in to their treasurers within ten days, there being hardly men\r\nenough to receive it or room to lay it in.\" It was in vain that Charles\r\nprotested and threatened the citizens with the loss of their charter if\r\nthey carried out the behests of the Commons.(532) His protest was only met\r\nwith a further levy of £50,000 on all strangers and aliens residing within\r\nthe city.(533)\r\n\r\n(M229) (M230)\r\n\r\nGurney’s position as mayor had become more and more an anomalous one every\r\nday. In July he was impeached by the Commons for having published the\r\nking’s commission of array in the city. On the 12th August the Lords\r\nsentenced him to be imprisoned during the pleasure of the House, and to be\r\ndeprived of his mayoralty,(534) and at the same time ordered Sir Nicholas\r\nRaynton to summon a Common Hall for the election of a new mayor. A Common\r\nHall was accordingly summoned for the 16th, when Isaac Pennington and John\r\nWollaston being nominated by the livery, the former was selected by the\r\nCourt of Aldermen as Gurney’s successor.(535) Upon application being made\r\nto Gurney for the _insignia_—the sword, cap, mace and collar of esses—\"he\r\npretended they were at his house in London, locked up, and he could not\r\ncome at them\"; and he stoutly refused to deliver up the city’s sword to\r\nany one but the king.(536) With a rigid Puritan like Pennington in the\r\nmayoralty chair, and Gurney and Sir Thomas Gardiner already impeached, the\r\ncity was made secure for parliament before Charles set up his standard at\r\nNottingham (22 Aug.) in token that the Civil War had commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M231)\r\n\r\nIt was the general opinion of both parties that the war would be a short\r\none. A deputation from both Houses attended a court of Common Council held\r\non the 25th August. It had been decided that an army should at once set\r\nout so as not to \"prolong or draw out a war,\" and in order to keep the\r\nfield of action at a distance from London. But arms were wanted. The City\r\nwas therefore asked to supply the parliamentary forces with 6,000 muskets\r\nand 4,000 pikes.(537) It was difficult to raise this quantity of arms in\r\nthe city without depriving the trained bands of their weapons, a course\r\nwhich was entirely out of the question. At first the halls of the various\r\ncompanies were ransacked for arms; this having been done and a deficiency\r\nstill remaining, a house-to-house visitation was resolved on.(538)\r\n\r\n(M232)\r\n\r\nIt behoved the citizens to look to themselves at this crisis; and\r\naccordingly the Common Council resolved early in September to raise two\r\nadditional regiments of foot, each 1,200 strong, and four troops of sixty\r\nhorse for the defence of the city. In order to defray the necessary charge\r\nparliament was asked to sanction the setting apart of £25,000 out of the\r\nmoney and plate subscribed by the inhabitants for the general defence of\r\nthe kingdom; and the House, not wishing to run the risk of losing the\r\ngoose that laid the golden egg, readily gave its assent.(539)\r\n\r\n(M233)\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Militia, to whom the defence of the city was entrusted,\r\ntook care—\"with most loyal intentions to his majesty,\" as they were\r\ncareful to make known—that the city’s force, consisting of forty companies\r\nin six regiments, was properly exercised both together and by separate\r\nregiments, one regiment \"going abroad\" weekly for exercise. The action of\r\nthe committee gave rise to much adverse comment by royalists, and led to\r\ntwo members of the committee, viz., Sir John Gayer and Sir Jacob Garrard,\r\nwithdrawing from it. At the request of the committee the Common Council\r\nagreed that the lord mayor and sheriffs should take the place of the\r\nretired members, and at the same time signified their approval of all that\r\nthe Committee of Militia had done for the defence of the city.(540)\r\n\r\n(M234)\r\n\r\nSkippon and other officers were directed (6 Sept.) to take a view of the\r\ncity and liberties and inspect the gates and posterns, and especially a\r\npassage through the Bell Inn into the fields at Temple Bar. They were to\r\nconsider the advisability of stopping up the less used passages as adding\r\nto the city’s peril, and of erecting more watch-houses in addition to\r\nthose about to be made at Moorgate and Bishopsgate. They were further to\r\nreport anything that might the better conduce to the safety of the city\r\nand liberties \"in these times of great and eminent danger.\"(541)\r\nPennington, the new mayor, had previously given orders for the gates and\r\nportcullises to be seen to, the city’s chains and posts repaired, and the\r\nusual precautions to be taken against fire.(542)\r\n\r\n(M235)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th September Essex set out from London to put himself at the head\r\nof the parliamentary army which (it was fondly hoped) was to make short\r\nwork of the royalists. He carried with him, we are told, his coffin and\r\nhis winding-sheet, together with his funeral escutcheon, in token of his\r\nreadiness to die in the cause.(543) On the 14th he reviewed his forces,\r\nand was soon convinced that they would quickly desert unless promptly\r\npaid. Disaffection had appeared in the ranks a week before, the soldiers\r\ndemanding five shillings a man, which sum had been promised them monthly,\r\nand threatening to throw down their arms unless paid.(544)\r\n\r\n(M236)\r\n\r\nIn this strait the earl despatched a letter to the City desiring a loan of\r\n£100,000 for the maintenance of the army.(545) This letter having been\r\nread to the Common Council (15 Sept.) and well received, the mayor issued\r\nhis precept to the aldermen of each ward to incite the inhabitants to\r\nunderwrite the loan.(546)\r\n\r\n(M237)\r\n\r\nA month later the Common Council was informed (18 Oct.) that Prince Rupert\r\nwas expected soon to be on his way towards London. What force would the\r\nCity be prepared to put in the field in order to stay the advance of the\r\n\"adverse party\"? After due deliberation answer was made to the \"Close\r\nCommittee\" of parliament that twelve companies of the trained bands would\r\nbe prepared to join the forces of the adjacent counties at any place the\r\ncommittee might appoint \"for the defence of religion, the king, kingdom,\r\nparliament and the city.\"(547) The aspect of the city at this time was\r\nthat of a huge military depôt. Everywhere was heard the sound of\r\nmusket-shot and rattle of drum, besides the noise of the squib or other\r\nfirework of the frolicsome apprentice. So great and continuous was the din\r\nthat it had to be restricted by precept of the mayor.(548)\r\n\r\n(M238)\r\n\r\nThe whole city, as described by a Puritan soldier in a letter to a\r\nmerchant of London,(549) was now \"either real or constrained Roundheads.\"\r\nThere were exceptions, however, but these were to be found chiefly among\r\nthe wealthier and more aristocratic class of citizens. They were\r\nstigmatised as \"Delinquents\" or \"Malignants,\" and as such were committed\r\nto prison, and their estates seized to provide means for protecting the\r\ncity and carrying on the war. Out of thirty-seven \"delinquents\" imprisoned\r\nin Crosby House a month later, three at least were aldermen of the city,\r\nviz., Sir William Acton, Sir George Whitmore and Sir John Cordell.(550)\r\n\r\n(M239)\r\n\r\nAt Michaelmas Pennington was re-elected mayor,(551) and, as the lord\r\nkeeper was with the king, Pennington presented himself before the House of\r\nLords for approval of his re-election.  He took the opportunity of\r\nmentioning a few city matters concerning which he desired their\r\nlordships’s advice. In the first place he had received the king’s writ for\r\nproclamation of the adjournment of the next law term, and he wished to\r\nknow if he was to act upon it. Secondly, there had been recently a riot at\r\nSt. Paul’s, and the rioters had been committed to prison, and he desired\r\nto know what proceedings should be taken against them. Lastly, he had to\r\ncomplain of the seditious character of the sermons preached at St. Paul’s,\r\nthe preacher being appointed by the Bishop of London. Indeed, they had\r\nbeen so bad that he and his brother aldermen had ceased to attend. He\r\nasked that the appointment of preachers might be vested in the lord mayor,\r\naccording to a former order of their lordships. On the first two questions\r\nan immediate answer was given. As to the proclamation for the adjournment\r\nof the term, it had received the sanction of the Lords, and therefore the\r\nmayor was at liberty to publish it. Touching the rioters at St. Paul’s,\r\nthey might be proceeded with according to law. The question as to the\r\nappointment of preachers at St. Paul’s, that was a matter which required\r\nfurther consideration.(552)\r\n\r\n(M240)\r\n\r\nThe first serious conflict between the forces of king and parliament took\r\nplace at Edge-hill (23 Oct.), when both parties claimed the victory. With\r\nCharles, however, rested the more immediate fruits of success, for he had\r\novercome the first obstacle that stood in his way to London. That Charles\r\ndid not enter London as a conqueror was owing to the determined front\r\nshown to his forces by the trained bands of the City, and the energy\r\ndisplayed by the inhabitants at large. If anything were needed to\r\nstimulate exertion on the part of the Londoners, they found it in the\r\nreports which daily arrived of country houses being despoiled by the\r\nroyalist soldiery. Few doubted that if allowed to enter the city the\r\nwealth of London would be at their mercy. \"You see what is threatened\r\nyou,\" said the Earl of Holland to the citizens at the Guildhall, soon\r\nafter the battle, \"you must know what to expect and what to trust to; they\r\nintend you no lesse (and that is to be believed) than the destroying of\r\nthe city, your persons and the preying upon your fortunes.\"(553)\r\n\r\n(M241)\r\n\r\nBy the 12th November Charles had made himself master of Brentford. The\r\nnext day (13th Nov.) was Sunday; nevertheless, the House sat and received\r\na deputation of Londoners, who, \"in the name of the Godly and active part\r\nof the city,\" placed their persons, purses and estates at the command of\r\nthe House to do with them at its pleasure, and declared that they would\r\n\"man out every man his man and make their own captains and officers, and\r\nlive and die with the House of Commons, and in defence thereof.\"(554) An\r\noffer made by the citizens of London to raise one thousand light-horse and\r\nthree thousand dragoons was gladly accepted by both Houses of\r\nParliament.(555) These were placed under the command of Skippon, now\r\npromoted to the rank of Serjeant-Major-General in the army under Essex.\r\nThe citizens were sorry to lose one who had done so much to raise the\r\ndiscipline of the city forces, but there was no withstanding the appeal\r\nmade to them by the leader of the parliamentary forces.(556)\r\n\r\n(M242)\r\n\r\nThe city was ransacked for soldiers, who, by the way, were allowed certain\r\nprivileges, being charged no more than a penny a night for lodging and\r\nthree half-pence for a quart of beer, and every available man was ordered\r\nto be despatched (18 Nov.) to join Essex at Turnham Green.(557) Charles\r\ndeemed discretion to be the better part of valour and withdrew from\r\nBrentwood, which was immediately occupied by Essex, and made his way to\r\nReading. The golden opportunity thus lost was never regained.\r\n\r\n(M243)\r\n\r\nHitherto the parliamentary cause had been supported by loans which were in\r\nname, if not in actual fact, voluntary. The spasmodic nature of this\r\nmethod of obtaining a supply of money for the army proved a source of\r\nweakness. The Houses therefore resolved to change it for the more\r\neffective system of raising money by taxation. The rest of the kingdom\r\nwould thus bear its share of the burden, which until now had been chiefly\r\nborne by the city of London. Inhabitants of the city who had never before\r\ncontributed to so-called voluntary loans would now be compelled to pay\r\ntheir quota. Those who had not already contributed to the support of the\r\narmy were now compelled to do so, in money, plate, horse, horsemen or\r\narms. Every man was to be assessed according to his ability, but no one\r\nwas to be assessed above a twentieth part of his estate. Payment was to be\r\nenforced by distress of goods in cases of refusal, and the aid of the\r\ntrained bands might be invoked if necessary.(558)\r\n\r\n(M244)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a deputation of members of both Houses attended a meeting\r\nof the Common Hall and asked for a loan of £30,000. The mayor forthwith\r\nissued his precept for a return to be made of the names of every\r\ninhabitant of each ward for the purpose of an assessment.(559)\r\n\r\n(M245)\r\n\r\nThe city was becoming more and more agitated by party faction every day.\r\nRoyalist and parliamentarian openly acknowledged the side he favoured by\r\nwearing a distinctive badge,(560) and disturbances were of frequent\r\noccurrence. To many the state of affairs had become little less than\r\ndisastrous, owing to the shutting up of shops and the stoppage of trade.\r\nThe new parliamentary taxation increased the general dissatisfaction and\r\nmade the citizens sigh for peace. On the 12th December two petitions were\r\nlaid before the Common Council. Both petitions advocated peace. One of\r\nthem was objected to by the court as too dictatorial in tone and as\r\ncasting an aspersion on parliament. They nevertheless ordered it to be\r\nentered on record, \"to the end their dislike might the better\r\nappear.\"(561) Whilst these petitions were under consideration in the\r\nCouncil Chamber, which stood almost on the same spot as that on which the\r\npresent new and handsome structure stands, cries were heard proceeding\r\nfrom an angry crowd in the adjacent hall. On all sides there arose a\r\nclamour for peace. The lives of the lord mayor and the unpopular aldermen\r\nwere even threatened. The few soldiers who happened to be present received\r\nsome rough handling, and were told to go and spend the money they had\r\nreceived from the State at the tavern, for they should have no more. At\r\nlast a body of the city trained bands arrived and order was restored. The\r\nCommon Council continuing its deliberations set aside both petitions, but\r\nappointed a committee to draw up on its behalf two other petitions\r\nadvocating a cessation of hostilities, one to be presented to the king and\r\nthe other to parliament.(562)\r\n\r\n(M246)\r\n\r\nOn the 19th December these petitions, which had previously been submitted\r\nto the Common Council for approval,(563) were laid before both Houses of\r\nParliament, the sheriffs and certain members of the Court of Aldermen and\r\nof the Common Council attending at the bar of the House of Commons and\r\npublicly disavowing any other petition. Having notified its approval of\r\nboth petitions the House gave orders that those who had been suspected of\r\ntaking part in the late tumult at the Guildhall should be committed as\r\nprisoners to Lambeth House.(564) A week later (26 Dec.) both Houses were\r\nprepared to open negotiations with the king.(565)\r\n\r\n(M247) (M248)\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the sanction of parliament to present their petition to\r\nCharles, the Common Council left it to the mayor to send whom he would to\r\n\"Mr. Secretary Falkland to learn his majesties pleasure whether certeine\r\ncitizens might with safety repaire unto his highness\" with the City’s\r\npetition, and in the meanwhile nominated the members of the deputation who\r\nshould wait upon the king if Falkland’s reply to the mayor’s messenger\r\nproved satisfactory.(566) The reply was favourable, and the deputation set\r\nout for Oxford, where Charles had taken up his quarters. On their return\r\nthey reported the result of their journey to the Common Council.(567) They\r\narrived in Oxford, said they, between one and two o’clock on the afternoon\r\nof Monday, the 2nd January (1643), and an hour later waited upon Lord\r\nFalkland at his lodgings in New College. At five o’clock the same evening\r\nthey were admitted into the king’s presence and the City’s petition was\r\nthen publicly read. The king professed satisfaction at seeing them, for he\r\ncould now be sure that certain printed declarations of his would reach\r\nthose for whom they were intended. He questioned very much the ability of\r\nthe City to protect his person, seeing that it was unable to preserve\r\npeace among themselves. On Wednesday (4 Jan.) the deputation was dismissed\r\nwith a promise that Charles would send an answer by Mr. Herne (or Heron),\r\none of his own servants, who would accompany them on their return. He\r\nasked which was the larger assembly, the Common Council or the Common\r\nHall. On being told that the latter were more numerous he directed that\r\nhis answer should be read there, as he wished as many as possible to be\r\ndisabused and to know the truth. Just when the deputation was about to set\r\nout from Oxford on its return a printed paper purporting to be the king’s\r\nanswer was handed to Sir George Garrett and Sir George Clark as they sat\r\nin their coach. The Common Council having heard the whole story of the\r\nmission to Oxford deemed it expedient to inform the House of Commons of\r\nthe result, and to lay the printed paper in their hands.(568) This was\r\naccordingly done on the 11th January, with the result that the House\r\ndirected the mayor to summon a Common Hall for Friday, the 13th, to hear\r\nthe king’s reply.(569) When the Common Hall met at the appointed time it\r\nwas only to hear a long diatribe against the heinousness of those who had\r\ntaken up arms against their king. All good subjects were called upon to\r\nthrow off their yoke, and to begin by arresting the lord mayor and certain\r\nleading citizens who had been guilty of treason. When this had been done,\r\nand not before, he would be prepared to return to London without the\r\nprotection of his army, or, to use the expression of the petitioners\r\nthemselves, with his \"royal,\" and not his \"martial attendance.\"(570)\r\n\r\n(M249)\r\n\r\nAfter this Pym, who attended the Common Hall and heard the king’s\r\nreply,(571) had no difficulty in convincing the assembly of the king’s\r\nreal mind, and that he had no intention to accept terms of peace. The\r\nmeeting was all but unanimous for continuing the war rather than submit to\r\nthe degradation of their mayor. A subsequent attempt by Charles to have\r\nhis reply circulated among the livery companies was frustrated by an order\r\nof the House of Commons (24 Jan.) which granted the sheriffs an indemnity\r\nfor refusing to execute the king’s order.(572)\r\n\r\n(M250)\r\n\r\nIf the war was to be carried on it was necessary for parliament to face\r\nthe difficulty of getting a steady supply of money. Up to this moment the\r\nnew parliamentary taxes had brought in nothing. Many of the wealthier\r\nclass of citizens absolutely refused to pay. At a Common Hall held on the\r\n17th January Alderman Garway pointed out, in a very strong speech, the\r\ndanger which would beset merchants trading with foreign parts if the king\r\nwithdrew his protection from them in consequence of the city contributing\r\nto the maintenance of the parliamentary army. His speech was followed by a\r\ngreat tumult, and the meeting broke up amid cries of \"No money, no money!\r\npeace, peace!\"(573)\r\n\r\n(M251)\r\n\r\nThe payment of the assessment made in November last had been widely\r\nrefused. The war had already ruined many, and if some refused to pay on\r\nprinciple others refused from sheer inability. Among the former must be\r\nreckoned Sir George Whitmore,(574) a royalist alderman of considerable\r\nmeans, who, with Thomas Knyvett, a goldsmith, Paul Pindar, and others\r\npreferred imprisonment to pay what was by them considered an illegal\r\ntax.(575)\r\n\r\n(M252)\r\n\r\nNevertheless application was made to the City at this juncture for a loan\r\nof £60,000 to keep the army from disbanding. A deputation from both Houses\r\nof Parliament attended a court of Common Council held on the 18th\r\nFebruary, and assured the citizens that the money would be repaid out of\r\nthe weekly payments which parliament had resolved to impose upon every\r\ncounty in England.(576) This would be the last time, as they hoped, that a\r\ncall of this kind would be made upon the city. The council declared its\r\nwillingness to promote the loan, the members present promising an\r\nimmediate payment of £6,000. Ministers were recommended to lay the matter\r\nbefore their respective congregations on the following Sunday and exhort\r\nthem to contribute.(577)\r\n\r\n(M253)\r\n\r\nA weekly assessment of £10,000 had been imposed on the City, whilst a\r\nmonthly rebate was allowed of £3,000. The Common Council complained to\r\nparliament that the City was over-assessed in comparison with other\r\ncounties, and suggested that the monthly allowance should be raised to\r\n£4,000. They also desired some security for the repayment of the loan of\r\n£60,000. These and other proposals were laid before the House as being\r\n\"encouragements\" for the City to make the loan; and the House, in\r\nreturning thanks to the City for its readiness in the matter of the loan,\r\npromised that the \"encouragements\" should receive favourable\r\nconsideration.(578)\r\n\r\n(M254)\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their financial difficulties the Commons had been busy\r\nelaborating the propositions for peace sent down to them from the Lords.\r\nAt length these were complete, and on the 1st February were presented to\r\nthe king. They were, however, received by Charles with little favour, and\r\nthe rest of the month was consumed by both Houses in an endeavour to\r\narrive at a compromise at once satisfactory to themselves and likely to be\r\nacceptable to the king.\r\n\r\n(M255)\r\n\r\nBefore fresh terms of compromise were formulated the House was asked (23\r\nFeb.) to consider certain other propositions drawn up by the Common\r\nCouncil of the city. These were three in number. The first desired the\r\nreformation of the army. The second demanded an indemnity to the citizens\r\nfor their adhesion to parliament. The third was a proposal for a religious\r\ncovenant and association for the defence of religion and liberty in case\r\nthe negotiations with the king should fall through. To only one of these\r\npropositions did the House give an immediate reply, and that was the\r\nsecond. To this the Commons returned answer that in the intended treaty\r\nwith the king such care would be taken for the indemnity of the City and\r\ncitizens of London and of the privileges thereof as should secure them and\r\n\"be a witness to the present and future generations of their fidelity to\r\nthe king and parliament.\"(579)\r\n\r\n(M256)\r\n\r\nThat the citizens entertained but little hopes of a peaceful issue to the\r\nnegotiations with Charles is evinced by their resolving (23 Feb.) to carry\r\nout a comprehensive scheme of defence of the city and suburbs.(580) The\r\nscheme received the sanction of parliament, which further allowed the\r\ncivic authorities to call upon the inhabitants of the suburbs as well as\r\nof the city proper to contribute to the undertaking.(581) The City had a\r\nhard task to get subscriptions in from the outlying districts, and was\r\nconsequently obliged to advance out of its own Chamber no less than six\r\nsums of £2,000 each between the months of March and July lest the work of\r\nerecting the necessary fortifications should be brought to a\r\nstandstill.(582)\r\n\r\n(M257)\r\n\r\nIn the face of this extraordinary expenditure the City was the more\r\nanxious to get its weekly assessment reduced. On the 1st March Colonel\r\nVenn, one of the city’s members, informed the Common Council that the\r\napplication to have the assessment reduced had been made too late, but the\r\nHouse would allow the City an additional monthly sum of £3,000 in aid of\r\nits defences so long as the ordinance for a weekly assessment should\r\ncontinue in force.(583)\r\n\r\n(M258)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th March a deputation from both Houses, including Pym, informed\r\nthe Common Council of a message that had recently arrived from the Earl of\r\nEssex to the effect that Prince \"Robert\" (Rupert) had arrived with a large\r\nforce within four miles of Bristol, and the earl intended forthwith to\r\nmake an advance. His army, however, was sadly in arrears of payment; he\r\nwanted both men and money, and this fact he had desired to be represented\r\nto the citizens of London. Pym, therefore, in the name of both Houses\r\ndesired the Common Council to hasten as far as possible the payment of the\r\nresidue of the £60,000 already promised, and to furnish such forces as the\r\ncity could spare.\r\n\r\n(M259)\r\n\r\nAs far as the first part of the request went the council promised its\r\nready assistance.(584) It frankly acknowledged that little more than\r\none-third of the whole amount promised had come in, but there were\r\ndifficulties in the way of getting it in. A large sum of money—as much as\r\n£30,000—which ought to have been repaid to the lenders out of the estates\r\nof malignants was still owing, and lenders were thereby discouraged. Men\r\nof ability refused to lend, and there were no means of forcing them;\r\nwhilst divers rich men had left the city, carrying with them what property\r\nthey could, and leaving their houses empty. Nevertheless, the council\r\nassured the deputation that it was well affected to parliament, all but a\r\nvery few of its members having already contributed, and it would forthwith\r\ntake steps to get the money in. Touching the furnishing of soldiers, the\r\ncouncil remarked that there were but three regiments in the city besides\r\nthe trained bands, two of which were on active service and the one\r\nremaining was on outpost duty.(585)\r\n\r\n(M260)\r\n\r\nSoon after the outbreak of the war it was seen that the weak point of the\r\nparliamentary army lay in its cavalry. Already something had been done\r\ntowards remedying this defect. Volunteers had offered themselves for the\r\nformation of a troop of horse at their own expense, and a \"seminary\" for\r\ncavalry had been established.(586) The news about Rupert urged the\r\ncitizens to a greater effort. On the 15th March an offer was made to the\r\nCommon Council to raise no less than ten volunteer regiments, three of\r\nwhich were to consist of cavalry. The men were to receive no pay except\r\nwhen engaged on active service, and only a small sum was asked for, in\r\norder to provide colours, drums and other necessaries. The offer was\r\ngladly accepted.(587)\r\n\r\n(M261)\r\n\r\nThe last loan of £60,000 could scarcely have been subscribed before an\r\norder came from the Commons for the city to make a further advance of\r\n£40,000 for the support of the army.(588)\r\n\r\n(M262)\r\n\r\nThe East India Company was at the same time called upon to lend its\r\nordnance and military store for the defence of the city. In case of\r\nrefusal both ordnance and provisions were to be seized, on the\r\nunderstanding that the City would restore them in as good condition as it\r\nreceived them or give satisfaction for them. Should any great emergency\r\narise the Commons would supply the company with what was necessary.(589)\r\nThe livery companies too were exhorted to lend their arms. These were to\r\nbe stored at Salters’ Hall, in Bread Street.(590)\r\n\r\n(M263)\r\n\r\nA few days later the negotiations between parliament and the king for a\r\ncessation of hostilities collapsed, and the parliamentary commissioners at\r\nOxford were ordered to return home (14 April).(591) Irritated at the\r\nking’s obstinacy, the Puritan party vented its spleen by ordering the\r\nwholesale destruction of superstitious or idolatrous monuments in\r\nWestminster Abbey and elsewhere. The City followed suit by asking\r\nparliament to sanction the removal of Cheapside cross, \"in regard of the\r\nidolatrous and superstitious figures there about sett and fixed.\"(592) In\r\n1581 these figures had given cause for offence and were secretly\r\nremoved,(593) but others had apparently been set up in their place. The\r\ndemolition of the cross, which took place on the 2nd May amid signs of\r\npublic rejoicing, was followed (10 May) by the public burning of the \"Book\r\nof Sports\" by the hands of the common hangman in Cheapside.(594) Another\r\nmeasure in the same direction was the placing of the appointment of\r\npreachers in St. Paul’s Churchyard in the hands of the mayor and aldermen,\r\na proposal which the mayor had formerly suggested to the House of\r\nCommons.(595)\r\n\r\n(M264)\r\n\r\nNow that all hopes of a peaceful settlement had gone, Charles took\r\nmeasures to gain over as many Londoners as he could to his side. He had\r\npreviously (16 March) caused a commission of array to be drawn, addressed\r\nto Gardiner, who was still Recorder, and others, authorising them to raise\r\na force on his behalf in the city.(596) This commission he had retained at\r\nOxford until he could find an opportunity for conveying it safely to\r\nLondon. It was now entrusted to Lady Daubeny to carry to London. She\r\nsucceeded in her mission and handed the document over to a city\r\nlinendraper named Chaloner, who, in his turn, transferred it to Tompkins,\r\na brother-in-law of Waller the poet, who was also implicated in the design\r\nwhich on that account came to be known as \"Waller’s Plot.\" Tompkins\r\nendeavoured to conceal it in a cellar, but it did not escape the prying\r\neyes of parliamentary searchers. Early in the morning of the 31st May\r\nTompkins was arrested, and in the course of time both he and Chaloner paid\r\nthe penalty of their rashness by being hanged in front of their own\r\nhouses, the one in Cornhill and the other in Holborn. Waller was also\r\ntaken and flung into prison.(597)\r\n\r\n(M265)\r\n\r\nThursday, the 15th June, was appointed to be kept as a day of thanksgiving\r\nfor deliverance from the plot,(598) and on that day the new parliamentary\r\nvow or covenant, binding those who took it to support the forces raised in\r\ndefence of parliament against those raised by the king, was generally\r\naccepted in the city.\r\n\r\n(M266)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Essex had besieged and taken Reading (26 April), but his\r\ntroops became affected with disease, and he made no attempt to advance on\r\nOxford until June.  Before his arrival Hampden had received a mortal wound\r\nat Chalgrove Field (18 June). On the 5th July the royalist forces under\r\nHopton worsted the parliamentary army under Waller in the west, whilst a\r\nsimilar success was achieved against Fairfax in the north (30 June). The\r\nking had reason to be elated as he rode into Oxford (14 July) accompanied\r\nby the queen, from whom he had been separated for fifteen months, amid the\r\nshouts of men and the ringing of bells.\r\n\r\n(M267) (M268)\r\n\r\nParliament and the City, on the other hand, had reason to be dejected. On\r\nthe 17th July Charles issued a proclamation for seizing all merchandise on\r\nits way to London. The trade of the city became paralysed.(599) Nor was\r\nthis all. For some months past the citizens had been suffering from a\r\nscarcity of coal. Ever since the appointment of the Earl of Newcastle as\r\ngovernor of the town of Newcastle in June, 1642,(600) that town had been\r\nheld for Charles, and a refusal to allow its coal to be supplied to the\r\nsupporters of parliament had brought the city of London and the eastern\r\ncounties into great straits.(601) It thus became a matter of prime\r\nimportance that Newcastle should be captured. How this was to be\r\naccomplished was set out in a series of propositions drawn up (25 May,\r\n1643) by the Common Council of the city to be laid before parliament.(602)\r\nA monopoly of the trade in coal, salt and glass with the north of England\r\nwas to be held out as an incentive for persons to adventure their money in\r\nthe reduction of the town. A committee, of which one-half of its members\r\nwas to be nominated by the Commons and the rest by the City, was to have\r\ncharge of all the money subscribed and to direct the undertaking. The\r\npropositions were well received (26 May),(603) and on the 10th June the\r\nCommon Council nominated three aldermen and seven common councilmen to\r\njoin with a like number to be appointed by parliament in raising a force\r\nby sea and land for the reduction of the town.(604)\r\n\r\n(M269)\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse news arrived on the 18th July that royalist cavalry\r\nwere in the vicinity of London, and that great disaffection to the cause\r\nof parliament had manifested itself in the neighbouring counties of Kent\r\nand Surrey. The Common Council, recognising the danger, forthwith resolved\r\nto raise what money it could at the rate of eight per cent., and to place\r\nit at the disposal of the Committee of the Militia of the city.(605)\r\n\r\n(M270) (M271)\r\n\r\nThe danger which threatened London was increased the more by reason of\r\ndissensions which sprang up among those whose particular care were the\r\ndefences of the city. A sub-committee which usually met at Salters’ Hall\r\nfell out with the Committee of the Militia of London for presuming to get\r\ninto its hands the sole power over the auxiliary forces which had lately\r\nbeen raised. Another committee was appointed to investigate the cause of\r\ndissension, and if possible to suggest a _modus vivendi_.(606) This was no\r\neasy matter to accomplish. It was eventually agreed to lay before\r\nparliament a petition that all the forces raised within the city and\r\nliberties, as also within the parishes adjacent mentioned in the weekly\r\nbill of mortality, might be under the sole command of the Committee of the\r\nMilitia of the city, under the direction of both Houses of\r\nParliament.(607) On the 18th July a petition to this effect was\r\naccordingly laid before the Commons by a deputation of aldermen and common\r\ncouncilmen, and received the approval of the House. The outcome of all\r\nthis was that the House eventually passed a resolution (29 July) that \"Sir\r\nWilliam Waller do command in chief all the forces raised within the city\r\nof London, and all other forces that are or shall be under the command of\r\nthe militia of London, subordinate to the lord mayor and militia,\" and at\r\nthe same time transferred the custody of the Tower into the hands of the\r\nlord mayor and sheriffs.(608)\r\n\r\n(M272)\r\n\r\nWaller’s appointment was a distinct slur upon Essex, about whom some\r\nrumours had been spread in order to prejudice him in the eyes of the City.\r\nThe Common Council took an early opportunity of deprecating strongly these\r\nfalse rumours, and appointed (1 Aug.) a deputation to wait upon \"his\r\nexcellency\" to assure him of the good opinion which the court—as the\r\nrepresentative body of the city—had of his great care and fidelity in the\r\npreservation of the king, parliament, city and kingdom, and to promise him\r\nevery assistance in recruiting his army. The citizens would stand by his\r\nexcellency with their lives and fortunes.(609)\r\n\r\n(M273) (M274)\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of a split in the parliamentary camp, the Lords renewed\r\ntheir proposals for peace. As soon as the City became aware of this there\r\nwas great consternation. A Common Council hurriedly met on Sunday\r\nafternoon (6 Aug.) and drew up a petition to the Commons praying them to\r\ncontinue the same course they had hitherto pursued and to reject all\r\npropositions for peace.(610) This petition was presented to the House on\r\nMonday (7 Aug.), when the proposals of the Lords came on again for\r\nconsideration. The House thanked the City for its care, recommended the\r\nlord mayor to take measures to prevent all disorders, and afterwards\r\nformally rejected the peace propositions.(611)\r\n\r\n(M275)\r\n\r\nWhilst the proposals of the Lords were under consideration the approaches\r\nof the Houses had been filled by an angry mob which threatened to return\r\nthe next day unless matters went as they pleased. On the morning of the\r\n8th August parliament was again besieged. This time it was by a crowd of\r\nwomen with white ribbons in their hats, shouting loudly for peace. The\r\nnext day they appeared in greater numbers, and having presented a petition\r\nfor the cessation of the war and received a courteous answer from the\r\nCommons, they refused to go home, but pressed on to the door of the House\r\nand demanded that the traitors who were against peace might be handed over\r\nto them. From words they resorted to stones and brickbats. At length a\r\nsmall body of Waller’s horse from the city appeared on the scene, and\r\norder was with difficulty restored.(612)\r\n\r\n(M276)\r\n\r\nOn the 7th a commission had arrived from Essex, in answer to the\r\nrecommendation of the House, appointing Waller to the command of all the\r\nforces to be raised by the city.(613) Four days later (11 Aug.) the\r\nCommittee of the Militia for the city desired the cooperation of the\r\nCommon Council in raising 1,000 horse, pursuant to an order of parliament\r\nof the 25th July, and on the following day (12 Aug.) Pennington issued a\r\nwarrant for pressing the number of horses required for delivery to\r\nWaller.(614)\r\n\r\n(M277)\r\n\r\nInstead of marching with his main army direct upon London from Bristol, as\r\nCharles had originally intended, he resolved to lay siege to Gloucester.\r\nOn the 10th August he appeared before its gates and formally summoned the\r\ntown to surrender.(615) The citizens of London were quick to realise the\r\nfact that the fall of Gloucester would endanger their own safety, and at\r\nonce took measures for defending themselves and sending relief to the\r\nbesieged town.\r\n\r\n(M278)\r\n\r\nOn the day after Gloucester had been summoned to surrender the Common\r\nCouncil, in view of \"the neare approach of the king’s forces,\" resolved to\r\ncall upon the livery companies to raise the sum of £50,000, for which the\r\nCity would give bonds at the rate of eight per cent. interest. The\r\ncompanies were to contribute according to their corn assessment. In\r\naddition to this every inhabitant of the city, citizen or stranger, was to\r\ncontribute to the Chamber a sum equal to fifty times the amount of subsidy\r\nhe had been in the habit of paying, and for this also the City would allow\r\nhim interest at the rate of eight per cent. after the first six months.\r\nThis mode of raising the money required subsequently (18 Aug.) received\r\nthe sanction of both Houses of Parliament, who guaranteed its repayment\r\n(24 Aug.).(616) The Merchant Taylors’ Company again hesitated before they\r\nconsented to pay the sum (£5,000) at which they were assessed, whilst the\r\nGrocers, on the other hand, displayed the same alacrity as before in\r\ncontributing their quota (£4,500), resolving to dispose of the remainder\r\nof their plate (with the exception of such as was absolutely necessary)\r\nfor the purpose.(617)\r\n\r\n(M279)\r\n\r\nTen days later (21 Aug.) the Committee of the Militia of the city declared\r\nits intention of sending a force under the command of Essex to assist in\r\nraising the siege of Gloucester, and at once ordered every shop to be\r\nclosed and all business suspended until Gloucester should be relieved. The\r\nregiments to be sent were to be chosen by lot. These consisted of two\r\nregiments of the trained bands, two of the auxiliaries, and a regiment of\r\nhorse; and with them were despatched eleven pieces of cannon and three\r\n\"drakes.\"(618)\r\n\r\n(M280)\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing his forces on Hounslow Heath in the presence of a large\r\nnumber of members of both Houses, Essex set out on his march (26 Aug.).\r\nThe troops suffered great privation from lack of food and water by the\r\nway. \"Such straits and hardships,\" wrote a sergeant in one of the London\r\nregiments, \"our citizens formerly knew not; yet the Lord that called us to\r\ndo the work enabled us to undergo such hardships as He brought us\r\nto.\"(619) By the 5th September every obstacle had been overcome and Essex\r\nappeared before Gloucester, only to see, however, the blazing huts of the\r\nroyalist army already in full retreat. Three days later he entered the\r\ncity amid the enthusiastic rejoicings of the inhabitants, who, but for his\r\ntimely arrival, would have been at the mercy of the enemy. The relief of\r\nGloucester, to which the Londoners contributed so much, \"proved to be the\r\nturning point of the war.\"(620)\r\n\r\n(M281)\r\n\r\nIf the Londoners fairly claimed some credit for the part they had taken\r\ntowards the relief of Gloucester, still more credit was due to them for\r\nthe bold stand they made a fortnight later (20 Sept.), at Newbury, against\r\nrepeated charges of Rupert’s far-famed cavalry. Again and again did\r\nRupert’s horse dash down upon the serried pikes of the London trained\r\nbands, but never once did it succeed in breaking their ranks, whilst many\r\na royalist saddle was emptied by the city’s musketeers, whose training in\r\nthe Artillery Garden and Finsbury Fields now served them in good stead.\r\nWhilst the enemy’s cannon was committing fearful havoc in the ranks of the\r\nLondoners they still stood their ground \"like so many stakes,\" and drew\r\nadmiration even from their enemies for their display of courage. \"They\r\nbehaved themselves to wonder,\" writes the royalist historian of the civil\r\nwar, and \"were, in truth, the preservation of that army that day.\"(621)\r\nNotwithstanding, however, all their efforts, the day was undecided.\r\nNeither party could claim a victory. Essex was glad enough to make his way\r\nto Reading, whilst Charles retired to Oxford. On their return to London\r\n(28 Sept.) the trained bands received an enthusiastic welcome, the mayor\r\nand aldermen going out to meet them at Temple Bar.\r\n\r\n(M282)\r\n\r\nTen days later the services of the trained bands were again required to\r\nassist in regaining the town of Reading, which had been occupied by the\r\nroyalists as soon as Essex had quitted it. Six regiments were to be\r\ndespatched for the purpose. Two regiments of the city’s trained bands were\r\nchosen by lot, as before, and the remainder of the force was made up out\r\nof the auxiliaries and the trained bands of Southwark and\r\nWestminster.(622) Orders were issued that if any member of the appointed\r\nregiments failed to appear on parade, his shop should be closed, and he\r\nhimself expelled beyond the line of fortifications.(623)\r\n\r\n(M283)\r\n\r\nIn no long time a mutinous spirit broke out among the trained bands, who,\r\nin the midst of an attack on Basing House, the mansion of the Marquis of\r\nWinchester, in the following month insisted upon returning home, and the\r\nsiege had to be abandoned. On the 28th November the sheriffs of London,\r\naccompanied by a deputation of aldermen, appeared at the bar of the\r\nCommons and boldly desired that the city regiments with Essex might be\r\ncalled home. Alderman Fowke or Foulke, a leading spirit in the city and\r\nstaunch parliamentarian, was one of the sheriffs at the time, and acted as\r\nspokesman. He laid before the House a plain statement as to how matters\r\nstood. The fact was that the troops were unpaid, and that no money was\r\nforthcoming. If money was found for the trained bands the civic\r\nauthorities, in consideration of the critical times, promised to do their\r\nbest to persuade them to remain longer in the field. The House resolved to\r\nraise £5,000 for the city’s forces on this understanding.(624) A month\r\nlater (30 Dec.) the Common Council formally approved of a request made by\r\nboth Houses of Parliament that two or three regiments of the trained bands\r\nshould be sent to reinforce Waller, who was endeavouring to recapture\r\nArundel.(625)\r\n\r\n(M284)\r\n\r\nThe recent signs of disaffection encouraged Charles to make another effort\r\nto win over the City, and in this he was promised the support of Sir Basil\r\nBrooke. Whilst accepting the services of one who was a warm Catholic,\r\nCharles addressed a letter to the mayor and aldermen, in which he assured\r\nthem of his \"constancy in religion.\" He foolishly imagined that such an\r\nassurance would induce the City to break at once with parliament and\r\ndeclare for peace. The letter, as luck would have it, fell into the hands\r\nof the Committee of Safety. The plot was discovered, and full particulars\r\nof it laid before the Commons (6 Jan., 1644).(626)\r\n\r\nThe discovery led to stricter precautions being taken to prevent\r\ninhabitants of the city leaving the city to join the king at Oxford, as\r\nmany ill-affected persons had already done. The number of passes was\r\nreduced, and the keys of the portcullises of the city’s gates were ordered\r\nfor the future to remain in the custody of the sheriffs.(627)\r\n\r\n(M285)\r\n\r\nIn token of the City’s constancy to parliament the Common Council resolved\r\n(12 Jan.) to invite both Houses to dinner.(628) The entertainment, which\r\ntook place at Merchant Taylors’ Hall (18 Jan.), was preceded by a sermon\r\npreached at Christ Church, Newgate, in favour of union. The preacher,\r\nStephen Marshall, received the formal thanks of the City, besides a\r\n\"gratification,\" and was desired to print his sermon. On their way from\r\nchurch to the banquet the Lords and Commons passed through Cheapside,\r\nwhere a pile of crucifixes, pictures and popish relics were in the act of\r\nbeing burnt on the site of the recently destroyed cross.(629) The City\r\nafterwards received the thanks of the Commons for the entertainment.\r\n\r\n(M286)\r\n\r\nThe day following the banquet the first regiments of the Scottish army\r\ncrossed the Tweed, driving the royalists of the extreme north of England\r\nto take shelter in Newcastle. The mutual understanding between England and\r\nScotland—the result of Pym’s policy—necessitated the appointment of some\r\ndefinite authority at Westminster which should control both armies in\r\ncommon. Hence it was that on the 16th February a Committee of Both\r\nKingdoms, composed of members of parliament and commissioners sent from\r\nScotland, was established to take the place of the Committee of Safety.\r\n\r\n(M287)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the City was busy increasing its defences and raising a force to\r\njoin in the next campaign. It was found necessary to cut down the pay of\r\nboth officers and men,(630) and to such straits were the authorities\r\ndriven for money to pay the troops that they could devise no better method\r\nthan that the inhabitants of the city should be called upon to set apart\r\nthe price of one meal every week for the purpose. The idea was at first\r\ndistasteful to the Common Council, but seeing no other alternative open\r\nthey eventually applied for and obtained the sanction of parliament to\r\ncarry it out.(631)\r\n\r\n(M288)\r\n\r\nThe council at the same time signified to parliament its regret that those\r\nreforms in the army which it had expressed a wish to have carried out, had\r\nnot been effected, and humbly prayed that Essex might be furnished with a\r\nforce such as the necessity of the times demanded, that command might be\r\ngiven to officers whose fidelity was beyond suspicion, and that such\r\ndiscipline might be maintained in his excellency’s army as might make it a\r\npattern of reformation to all the rest of the armies of the kingdom.(632)\r\n\r\n(M289)\r\n\r\nThe spring campaign opened successfully for parliament. When news of\r\nWaller’s success at Cheriton (29 March) reached London it was received\r\nwith enthusiastic joy, and, for a time at least, all thoughts of peace\r\nwere set aside. The City assisted parliament to raise a sum of £20,000 (3\r\nApril) and authorised the purchase of 3,000 muskets and 1,000 pikes on the\r\ncredit of the weekly meal money (3 April).(633) The Commons ordered a\r\npublic thanksgiving for the victory which had crowned their arms to be\r\nkept in London on the 9th April,(634) and the mayor was instructed to\r\nsummon a Common Hall to meet in the evening of that day for the purpose of\r\nhearing proposals from both Houses. All the advantages gained at Cheriton\r\nwere unfortunately lost by the city’s trained bands again insisting upon\r\nreturning home.\r\n\r\n(M290)\r\n\r\nThe Common Hall which was accordingly summoned was addressed by Warwick,\r\nVane, Essex, Pembroke, Hollis and Glyn, the new Recorder.(635) All the\r\nspeeches were pitched in the same strain. The City was thanked for its\r\npast services and exhorted to embrace the opportunity that now offered\r\nitself of putting an end to the existing distractions. It was purposed to\r\ndraw all available forces together to a general rendezvous at Aylesbury by\r\nthe 19th of the month, and the citizens were desired to offer themselves\r\n\"as one man,\" for it was to no purpose \"to go by little and little.\"\r\n\r\n(M291)\r\n\r\nThree days later (12 April) the Committee of Militia, which had recently\r\nreceived (8 April) a fresh commission, was instructed to call out six\r\nregiments of the auxiliaries. Three of them were to set out immediately to\r\njoin the parliamentary army, whilst the other three were to be held in\r\nreserve.(636) It was to little purpose, however, that the City kept\r\nsending out fresh forces, if these were to be continually insisting upon\r\nreturning home, as those under Waller had recently done for the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n(M292)\r\n\r\nGreat delay took place in getting the parliamentary forces into the field.\r\nThe 19th April, the day appointed for the rendezvous at Aylesbury, arrived\r\nand found Essex still unprepared. It was not until the 2nd May that the\r\nCommittee of the Militia of the city informed the Common Council that\r\nthree regiments out of the six to be called out were then in readiness to\r\nmarch. The committee asked the sanction of the council before giving\r\norders for the regiments to start because, they said, their powers had\r\nbeen much limited by their last commission (8 April). The council was in\r\nfavour of the regiments setting out at once towards Uxbridge, according to\r\ninstructions left behind by Essex, and the committee was directed to draft\r\nan ordinance for parliament to the effect that none of the forces might be\r\nkept longer abroad or sent further from London than the committee should\r\nfrom time to time think fit, and that the forces should be conducted and\r\ncommanded by such major-general and other officers of the brigade as the\r\ncommittee should appoint.(637) It was a repetition of the old story. The\r\nCity always insisted on appointing its own officers over its own men.\r\n\r\n(M293) (M294)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Committee of Both Kingdoms had been busy drawing up\r\nproposals for peace such as would at once satisfy both Houses as well as\r\nbe acceptable to Charles. At length the proposals were laid before the\r\nCommons and read the first time (29 April). The second reading was\r\nappointed for the 1st May. Before any further steps were taken in the\r\nmatter it was but right that the citizens of London, without whose aid the\r\nissue of the struggle between king and parliament might have been very\r\ndifferent to what it was, should be consulted. A deputation was therefore\r\nappointed (3 May) by the House to wait on the mayor, aldermen and common\r\ncouncil of the city and to express to them the willingness of parliament\r\nto consider any proposals that they might think fit to make on behalf of\r\nthe city, and to lay them before the king.(638) The City thanked\r\nparliament and referred the matter to a committee.(639)\r\n\r\n(M295)\r\n\r\nFor some time past there had been a flow of dissatisfied royalists from\r\nOxford to London, induced to embrace the parliamentary cause by an offer\r\nof pardon made by Essex (30 Jan.) to all who would return to their duty\r\nand take the covenant.(640) During 1643 the flow had been in the opposite\r\ndirection. It now became necessary to see that only genuine converts found\r\ntheir way into the city, and to this end parliament ordered (15 May) the\r\nmayor to take steps for the expulsion from the city and lines of\r\ncommunication of all suspicious persons such as had lately come from\r\nOxford, or any other of the king’s quarters, all recusants, the wives of\r\nrecusants and the wives of those who were in arms against the\r\nparliament.(641)\r\n\r\n(M296) (M297)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the term of three months for which the Committee of Both\r\nKingdoms had been originally appointed was fast drawing to a close, and\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion had manifested itself between the Lords\r\nand Commons as to its re-appointment. The former were in favour of\r\nincreasing the numbers of the committee, with the view no doubt of giving\r\na larger representation to the peace party, whilst the latter advocated a\r\nsimple renewal of the powers of the committee as it then stood. At this\r\njuncture, when the country seemed likely to be left without any central\r\nauthority to direct the movements of the parliamentary forces, the City\r\npresented a petition (16 May) to the Commons(642) setting forth the danger\r\nthat was likely to arise from the discontinuance of the committee, and\r\npraying that it might speedily be re-established as the present urgency of\r\naffairs required. The citizens took the opportunity of praying the Commons\r\nto see that the Tower of London, Windsor Castle and Tilbury Fort remained\r\nin good hands and were properly supplied with necessaries, and further\r\nthat none of the members of the House who had returned from Oxford might\r\nbe readmitted to their seats until they had given satisfactory pledges for\r\ntheir fidelity in the future. The re-admission of these members had been a\r\ncause of a long wrangle between the two Houses.\r\n\r\n(M298)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (18 May) a deputation from the Commons attended at the\r\nGuildhall with their answer.(643) They gratefully acknowledged the\r\nassistance they had received from the city, without which they would have\r\nbeen unable to achieve what they had done. An ordinance, they said, was\r\nbeing proceeded with for the continuance of the Committee of Both\r\nKingdoms; measures would be taken respecting the Tower, Windsor Castle and\r\nTilbury Fort such as would be for the security and satisfaction of the\r\nCity; and the House had already passed an ordinance touching the\r\nre-admission of members which it would see carried into execution. The\r\nanswer concluded by again acknowledging the obligation that parliament was\r\nunder to the City for spending its blood and treasure for the public good,\r\nwhich the House would ever have in remembrance and would endeavour to\r\nrequite.\r\n\r\n(M299)\r\n\r\nJust as matters were coming to a dead-lock the crisis was averted by the\r\nhappy thought of reviving an old ordinance which had already received the\r\nsanction of the Lords, but had hitherto been ignored and laid aside by the\r\nCommons. This ordinance, which proposed to confer unlimited powers on the\r\ncommittee, was now taken up and passed by the Commons, and thus the old\r\ncommittee was enabled to meet on the 24th May and continue its work.(644)\r\n\r\n(M300)\r\n\r\nParliament was still sadly in need of money, and on the 27th May appointed\r\na committee, of which the Recorder and one or two of the city aldermen\r\nwere members, to consider how best to raise it, \"either by particular\r\nsecurities or companies, or other particular persons beyond seas, or by\r\nmortgaging of any lands, or by putting to sale sequestered lands.\"(645)\r\nThe civil war appeared to be approaching a crisis. The town of Abingdon\r\nhad recently been abandoned by the royalists and occupied by Essex, whilst\r\nWaller was advancing in the direction of Wantage, to gain, if possible, a\r\npassage over the Thames above Oxford, and thus cut off Charles from the\r\nwest of England. Both generals sent notice of their movements to\r\nparliament, and on the 28th their letters (or an abstract of them) were\r\nread before the Common Council by a deputation of the recently appointed\r\ncommittee, and a request was made that the City would furnish the House\r\nwith a sum of £200,000 or £300,000 upon the security of the estates of\r\ndelinquents. Notwithstanding the difficulty the City was then experiencing\r\nin getting in the arrears of the monthly assessment and the weekly meal\r\naccount, it at once took steps to carry out the wishes of parliament.(646)\r\n\r\n(M301)\r\n\r\nFor some time past a royalist garrison in Greenland House, near Henley,\r\nhad caused considerable annoyance to the country round about it, and had\r\ncut off all communication by way of the Thames between London and the\r\nwest. On the 5th June the Common Council was asked to furnish one or more\r\nregiments to assist in reducing the garrison.(647) The council was the\r\nmore willing to accede to this request for the reason that the force was\r\nto be placed under the command of a city alderman, Major-General\r\nBrowne.(648)\r\n\r\n(M302)\r\n\r\nOn the 7th June information was brought to the City that Charles had been\r\nforced to flee from Oxford, and the Common Council was asked to render\r\nassistance in the reduction of the king’s stronghold.(649) As long as\r\nCharles was at large, not only was the prospect of an end of the war more\r\nthan ever remote, but the safety of London itself was threatened. It was a\r\ntime for Essex and Waller to forget all past differences and to strengthen\r\neach other in a joint attack upon the royalist army wherever it may be\r\nfound. Instead of this the two generals went different ways; Essex marched\r\nwestward, leaving Waller to pursue Charles as best he could. To make\r\nmatters worse, disaffection again appeared in the ranks of Waller’s\r\narmy.(650)\r\n\r\n(M303)\r\n\r\nThat the city trained bands had done good service in their day no one will\r\ndeny, but the time was fast approaching when it would be necessary to\r\nraise an army of men willing to devote themselves to the military life as\r\na profession. For permanent service in the field the London trained bands\r\nwere not to be relied on. \"In these two days’ march,\" wrote Waller (2\r\nJuly) to the Committee of Both Kingdoms, \"I was extremely plagued with the\r\nmutinies of the City Brigade, who are grown to that height of disorder\r\nthat I have no hope to retain them, being come to their old song of Home!\r\nHome!\" There was, he said, only one remedy for this, and that was a\r\nstanding army, however small;—\"My lords, I write these particulars to let\r\nyou know that an army compounded of these men will never go through with\r\nyour service, and till you have an army merely your own, that you may\r\ncommand, it is in a manner impossible to do anything of importance.\"(651)\r\nThe junction of his forces with those under Browne, who had been\r\ndespatched (23 June) to protect the country between London and the\r\nroyalist army, served only to increase the general discontent. \"My London\r\nregiments,\" he wrote (8 July), \"immediately looked on his [_i.e._\r\nBrowne’s] forces as sent to relieve them, and without expectation of\r\nfurther orders, are most of them gone away; yesterday no less than 400 out\r\nof one regiment quitted their colours. On the other side, Major-General\r\nBrowne’s men, being most of them trained band men of Essex and\r\nHertfordshire, are so mutinous and uncommandable that there is no hope of\r\ntheir stay. They are likewise upon their march home again. Yesterday they\r\nwere like to have killed their Major-General, and they have hurt him in\r\nthe face.... I am confident that above 2,000 Londoners ran away from their\r\ncolours.\"(652) The same spirit of insubordination manifested itself again\r\nwhen Waller threw himself (20 July) into Abingdon. Most of his troops were\r\nonly too anxious to leave him, whilst the Londoners especially refused to\r\nstir \"one foot further, except it be home.\"(653)\r\n\r\n(M304)\r\n\r\nAll this was not unnatural if unpatriotic. The absence of these men from\r\ntheir counters and shops portended bankruptcy to many. Even those who\r\nstayed at home found difficulty in carrying on their commercial pursuits,\r\nowing to the war. Credit had been given to persons who at the outbreak of\r\nthe war threw in their lot with the king. Their estates had thereupon been\r\nsequestrated by parliament, and the city merchant, tradesman or craftsman\r\nwas left to recover his debt as best he could. At length (2 Aug., 1644)\r\nthe Common Council took the matter up, and agreed to petition parliament\r\nthat delinquents might be brought to judgment, and that in all cases of\r\nsequestration provision might be made for payment of all just debts out of\r\ndelinquents’ estates.(654) Another grievance which the London tradesman\r\nhad was the large circulation of farthing tokens, which they were unable\r\nto get re-changed.(655)\r\n\r\n(M305)\r\n\r\nThe representations made by Waller as to the untrustworthiness of the\r\ntrained bands were such as parliament could not disregard. It resolved\r\ntherefore (12 July) to establish a permanent force amounting in all to\r\n10,000 foot and 3,050 horse, to be levied in the eastern and southern\r\ncounties, to take their place and form a small standing army.(656) The\r\ncity of London and the county of Middlesex were called upon to find 200\r\nhorse. The city’s contingent of 100 horse was reported as being ready\r\nearly in August, but money was wanted for their pay. The Common Council\r\nthereupon authorised the payment of £2,000 out of the weekly meal\r\nfund.(657)\r\n\r\n(M306) (M307)\r\n\r\nMore than three months had now elapsed since parliament offered to\r\nconsider any propositions that the municipal authorities might suggest for\r\nthe good of the city. At length these were ready, and were laid before the\r\nHouse on the 21st August. They were twenty-eight in number.(658) The first\r\nsix had reference to the appointment of justices of the peace in the city\r\nand Southwark, whilst others dealt with the City’s right to the\r\nconservancy of the Thames, the restitution of the City’s Irish estate and\r\nthe extension of its jurisdiction over the Tower. Parliament was further\r\nurged to empower the Common Council to correct, amend or repeal any by-law\r\nmade or procured by any company or mistery of London, notwithstanding any\r\nstatute or law to the contrary, and generally to extend the powers of the\r\nCity. Lastly, it was proposed that, as the city had grown very populous,\r\nthe citizens should be allowed to send two additional burgesses to\r\nparliament. The consideration of these propositions by the Commons was put\r\noff until October, when (25th) the House resolved that the City should be\r\ndesired to reduce the number of propositions and to state specifically a\r\nfew of the most important and to bring forward the rest in general terms,\r\nso that the propositions of the two kingdoms, which had been ready for\r\nsome time past, might be forwarded to the king without more delay.(659)\r\n\r\n(M308)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council met accordingly on the following day (26 Oct.) and\r\nreduced the number of propositions to six, viz., (1) that an Act be passed\r\nconfirming to the City its charters, customs and liberties; (2) that the\r\nmilitia of the city, as well as of the parishes beyond the city, and its\r\nliberties, but within the bills of mortality, should be regulated by the\r\nCommon Council; (3) that the Tower should be under the government of the\r\nCity; (4) that the City’s forces should not be forced to serve outside the\r\ncity; (5) that an Act might be passed confirming all by-laws and\r\nordinances made or to be made for calling and regulating the Common\r\nCouncil of the city; and (6) that such other propositions as should be\r\nmade for the safety and good government of the city, with the approval of\r\nboth Houses, might be confirmed by Act of parliament. These six\r\npropositions were ordered to be forthwith presented to parliament by the\r\nRecorder and by alderman Pennington (as lieutenant of the Tower), with an\r\nhumble desire that they might be sent to his majesty with the propositions\r\nof the two kingdoms. It was hoped that the rest of the propositions\r\nformerly presented by the City to the House of Commons might soon pass\r\nboth Houses of Parliament.(660)\r\n\r\n(M309)\r\n\r\nWhilst the propositions which were supposed to make for peace were under\r\nconsideration, the whole of the parliamentary forces under Essex in the\r\nwest of England, with the exception of the cavalry, had been compelled to\r\nsurrender to the royalist army. Deserted by their leader, and left by\r\ntheir cavalry to shift for themselves, the foot soldiers were driven to\r\naccept such terms as Skippon, who still stuck to his post, was able to\r\nobtain, and on the morning of the 2nd September they laid down their arms.\r\nNews of the disaster created great consternation in the city, and the\r\nCommon Council resolved (9 Sept.) to petition parliament to take steps to\r\nprevent the royalists occupying Reading as they had done before, and to\r\nhasten the passing of a measure for raising money for the maintenance of\r\nthe fortifications and guards of the city.(661)\r\n\r\n(M310)\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made to prevent Charles, who was coming up from the west,\r\nreaching the garrisons around Oxford, where he would be able to fight to\r\nadvantage, and the City was asked (13 Sept.) to send a contingent to\r\nassist Waller in that design. The Common Council thereupon gave its assent\r\n(20 Sept.) to the red and blue regiments of the trained bands being drawn\r\nout in conjunction with three other regiments, viz., one of the trained\r\nbands of Westminster, one of the trained bands of Southwark, and the\r\nauxiliaries of the Hamlets, and a week later (27 Sept.) voted the sum of\r\n£20,000 \"or thereabouts\" for defraying their cost.(662) This sum was\r\nafterwards raised to £22,000, of which £17,250 was to be raised in the\r\ncity and liberties, and the balance within the Tower Hamlets, the city of\r\nWestminster and borough of Southwark.(663)\r\n\r\n(M311)\r\n\r\nThese preparations were of little avail. As the royalist army came on\r\nWaller fell back, until at Newbury the opposing armies again tried\r\nconclusions (27 Oct.). Notwithstanding some success which attended the\r\nparliamentary forces, they failed to attain the main object in view, and\r\nCharles was able at the close of the day to continue his march to Oxford,\r\nwhich he entered on the 1st November.\r\n\r\n(M312)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime better news arrived from the north. Newcastle had at last\r\nsurrendered to the Scots (19 Oct.), and this intelligence gladdened the\r\nhearts of the parliamentary soldiers as well as of the citizens of London.\r\nThe city might now look for a plentiful supply of coal, a commodity which\r\nhad become so scarce that in July the civic authorities had received\r\npermission from parliament to dig for turf and peat, by way of a\r\nsubstitute for coal, wherever they thought fit.(664) Seeing that it was by\r\nthe aid of the city that a fleet had been maintained off the north coast,\r\nthat Berwick had been secured for parliament, and that a free passage had\r\nthus been kept open for the Scottish army, the civic authorities thought\r\nthemselves justified in appealing to parliament for repayment of the money\r\nformerly advanced by the adventurers.(665) Notwithstanding the surrender\r\nof Newcastle the citizens had to pay a high price for coal owing to a\r\nheavy impost set upon it by parliament, until, at the earnest request of\r\nthe municipal authorities, parliament consented to reduce it.(666)\r\n\r\n(M313)\r\n\r\nThe close of the year (1644) found the trade and commerce of the city in a\r\ndeplorable condition. Commercial intercourse with the woollen and linen\r\nmanufacturers of the west of England had been almost entirely cut off,\r\nwhilst the blockade of the east coast by the royalist navy deprived the\r\ncity of a great amount of corn, fish, butter, cheese and other provisions.\r\nThe citizens were greatly opposed to free trade being allowed with those\r\nports and towns which were in the hands of the royalists,(667) but they\r\nwere still more anxious to have their trade kept open with the west of\r\nEngland, and they petitioned parliament to that end.(668)\r\n\r\n(M314)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (31 Jan., 1645) a conference was opened at\r\nUxbridge to discuss three propositions for peace which parliament had\r\noffered to Charles at Oxford in November last. These propositions involved\r\nthe abolition of Episcopacy, and the placing the entire command of the\r\narmy and navy, as well as the future conduct of the war with Ireland, in\r\nthe hands of parliament. From the outset it appeared very unlikely that\r\nCharles would bring himself to accept the terms thus offered. After three\r\nweeks’ discussion negotiations were broken off and the so-called \"Treaty\r\nof Uxbridge\" fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M315) (M316)\r\n\r\nThe failure of the negotiations at Uxbridge hastened the passing of an\r\nordinance for re-modelling the army and placing it on such a footing that\r\nthe men should be in receipt of constant pay and the officers selected for\r\nmilitary efficiency alone. Ever since November the \"New Model\"\r\nordinance—as it was called—had been under consideration. In January it\r\npassed the Commons, but the Lords hesitated until the difference of\r\nopinion that had manifested itself at Uxbridge induced them to give their\r\nassent (15 Feb.). On the 4th March a deputation from both Houses came into\r\nthe city and informed the Common Council that, the Treaty of Uxbridge\r\nhaving fallen through, the Houses had resolved \"to put their forces into\r\nthe best posture they can for the vigorous prosecution of the war, as the\r\nbest means now left (under God) for the obtaining of peace.\" Parliament\r\nhad passed an ordinance—they proceeded to say—for raising £50,000 a month\r\nfor nine months for payment of an army under Sir Thomas Fairfax, and they\r\nnow asked the City to advance a sum of £80,000 on the security of the\r\nmoney so to be raised in the last five months out of the nine. The matter\r\nwas referred to a committee to carry out.(669)\r\n\r\n(M317)\r\n\r\nThe passing of the New Model ordinance was followed by the passing of a\r\nself-denying ordinance,(670) the original purport of which was to exclude\r\nall members of either House from commands in the army, but was afterwards\r\nso far modified as to compel existing officers to resign their\r\nappointments, leaving it to parliament to re-appoint them if it would.\r\nEssex, Waller and Manchester resigned, but when the time came for\r\nCromwell, the prime mover in the re-organisation of the army, to follow\r\nsuit, he and two or three others were re-appointed to commands in the new\r\narmy. The immediate effect of the passing of this ordinance upon the city\r\nof London was that Pennington, who had been appointed by parliament\r\nlieutenant of the Tower, had to resign his post. The nomination of his\r\nsuccessor was, however, left with the Common Council, who sent up the name\r\nof Colonel Francis West for the approval of the Commons (24 April).(671)\r\n\r\n(M318)\r\n\r\nWhilst the army was undergoing a process of reformation outside London,\r\nconsiderable activity prevailed within the city with the object of\r\nstrengthening its position. The Committee of Militia was instructed to\r\nraise a sufficient number of men to guard the city forts so that the\r\ntrained bands might be free for more active duties. Large sums of money\r\nwere voted to pay arrears due to gunners, \"mattrosses\" and workmen who had\r\nbeen engaged in erecting the fortifications. The sum of £500 was ordered\r\nto be laid out in the purchase of gunpowder. The scout-master for the city\r\nwas encouraged in his duty of bringing information of movements of the\r\nroyalist army by the payment of arrears due to him, and steps were taken\r\nto bring up the regiments of the city auxiliaries to their full complement\r\nby enlistments from the several wards.(672)\r\n\r\n(M319)\r\n\r\nThe first serious undertaking confided to Fairfax and the New Model army\r\nwas the siege of Oxford. The utter uselessness of such an enterprise,\r\nwhilst Charles was free to roam the country and deal blows wherever\r\nopportunity offered, failed to make itself apparent to the Committee of\r\nBoth Kingdoms, which still governed the movements of the parliamentary\r\narmy. The siege being resolved upon, a deputation from both Houses waited\r\non the Common Council (16 May) to ask for assistance in furnishing a force\r\nto set out under Major-General Browne to join Fairfax and Cromwell in the\r\nundertaking.(673) Four days later (20 May), when another deputation\r\nattended, the court instructed the committee of arrears sitting at\r\nWeavers’ Hall to raise £10,000 for the purpose.(674)\r\n\r\n(M320)\r\n\r\nWhilst the main force of the parliamentary army was wasting time in\r\nbesieging Oxford, care was taken to keep the country open round Taunton,\r\nrecently set free by a detachment sent by Fairfax. For this purpose\r\nMassey, the governor of Gloucester, was ordered to quit his post and march\r\ntowards Bristol.(675) The prospect of losing their governor, who had\r\nachieved so many military successes in the neighbourhood, threw the\r\ninhabitants of Gloucester into terrible consternation, and they went so\r\nfar as to petition parliament against his removal; but somehow or other\r\ntheir petition failed to be read before the Commons. In their distress\r\nthey caused their mayor to address a letter to the city of London (29 May)\r\nstating the facts of the case, and praying that the Londoners, who had\r\nalready done so much to save them from the hand of the enemy, would\r\ninterpose with the Commons on their behalf, so that Colonel Massey might\r\nbe allowed to remain. The civic authorities agreed (7 June) to lay the\r\nmatter before parliament;(676) but in spite of all representations Massey\r\nhad to go. The Londoners themselves were asked (9 June) to furnish 500\r\nmounted musketeers for Massey’s expedition, and were encouraged to do so\r\nby \"motives\" setting forth the gallant behaviour of the brigade in and\r\nabout Taunton, and the critical condition it was in by being cut off from\r\nprovisions. The Common Council ordered the motives to be printed and\r\ncirculated, with the result that sufficient money was raised to fit out\r\n500 dragoons.(677)\r\n\r\n(M321)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime considerable dissatisfaction manifested itself in the city\r\nat the state of affairs in general, and more particularly with the manner\r\nin which the movements of Fairfax and the New Model army were hampered by\r\norders from home. A petition from divers inhabitants of the city with\r\ncertain suggestions was laid before the Common Council for presentation to\r\nparliament. It was not customary, however, for the Common Council to\r\npresent petitions to parliament unless drawn up by themselves, but as the\r\nfeelings of the court were in sympathy with the petitioners it ordered two\r\npetitions to be drawn up embracing the substance of the original petition,\r\nand these were presented, one to each of the Houses. After setting forth\r\nwhat they esteemed to be the reasons for the ill success of the\r\nparliamentary cause, the petitioners made known their own wishes. In the\r\nfirst place, they desired that the army of Fairfax should be recruited,\r\nand that the general might be allowed greater freedom of action. Secondly,\r\nthat steps should be taken, before it was too late, to recover Leicester,\r\nwhich had recently (31 May) fallen into the king’s hands. Thirdly, that\r\nthe Scots should be urged to march southward. Fourthly, that Cromwell\r\nshould be placed in command of the Eastern Association. Fifthly, that\r\nadequate convoys should be provided for merchants; and lastly, that\r\nparliament should publish its own account of the recent negotiations, as\r\nwell as its resolutions against free trade by sea to such ports as were in\r\nthe king’s hands.(678) The petition, which was presented by Alderman Fowke\r\nto the Commons (4 June),(679) was favourably received by both Houses, and\r\nthe City thanked for its care.\r\n\r\n(M322)\r\n\r\nOne of the wishes expressed in the City’s petition was soon realised, for\r\nwithin a week Cromwell was appointed, not to the command of the Eastern\r\nAssociation as suggested, but to a still greater command, viz., the\r\nlieutenant-generalship of the army, an office which, by long prescription,\r\ncarried also the command of the cavalry, an arm of the service in which\r\nCromwell had especially shown himself a master.(680)\r\n\r\n(M323)\r\n\r\nFairfax, being now allowed a free hand, abandoned the siege of Oxford and\r\nset off in pursuit of the royal army. He came up with them at Naseby,\r\nwhere on the 14th June he succeeded, with the help of Cromwell and his\r\ncavalry, in obtaining a signal victory and utterly crushing the power of\r\nCharles in the field. Among the wounded on the parliamentary side was the\r\nCity’s old friend Skippon, \"shot under the arme six inches into his\r\nflesh.\" The pain of having his wound dressed caused him to groan. \"Though\r\nI groane, I grumble not,\" said he to the by-standers, and asked for a\r\nchaplain to come and pray for him.(681)\r\n\r\n(M324)\r\n\r\nThe victory at Naseby was celebrated in the city by a thanksgiving service\r\nat Christ Church, Newgate (19 June), which was attended by the members of\r\nboth Houses, followed by an entertainment at Grocers’ Hall. The hall not\r\nbeing large enough to contain the whole of the company, the members of the\r\nCommon Council dined by themselves at the hall of the Mercers Company.\r\nNothing was omitted that could serve to enhance the reputation of the\r\nCity.(682)\r\n\r\n(M325)\r\n\r\nThe wishes of the citizens were to be further gratified. The Scottish army\r\nwas about to move southward, and parliament had voted a month’s pay, or\r\n£31,000. The City was asked to assist in raising the money (14 June). To\r\nthis the Common Council readily agreed, but at the same time directed the\r\nRecorder to represent to parliament that the citizens were anxious for the\r\nScots to recover Leicester as speedily as possible.(683) Before the army\r\nhad time to make any great advance in this direction Leicester had\r\nsurrendered to Fairfax (18 June).\r\n\r\n(M326)\r\n\r\nIn July the City was called upon to assist in raising 1,000 horse and 500\r\ndragoons for the relief of the counties of Oxford, Buckingham, Berkshire\r\nand others, and the better security of the Association.(684) Three months\r\nlater (2 Sept.) another contingent of 500 light horse and a like number of\r\n\"dragoneers\" were required \"to pursue the forces of the king.\" Each member\r\nof the Common Council was directed to provide a light horse and arms or to\r\npay the sum of £12 in lieu thereof. A dragoon horse and arms might be\r\ncompounded for by payment of half that sum. Parliament agreed to charge\r\nthe excise with the sum of £16,000 to provide compensation for any loss\r\nthe contributors might sustain, whilst the City contributed out of its\r\nChamber the sum of £400 towards the pay of officers, the buying of\r\ntrophies and other necessaries.(685)\r\n\r\n(M327)\r\n\r\nThe aid of the City was now invoked by Plymouth as formerly it had been by\r\nGloucester. On the 5th September the mayor and aldermen of Plymouth\r\naddressed a letter to the mayor and common council of London enclosing a\r\npetition they were about to lay before parliament. The petition set forth\r\nhow, in the absence of Fairfax, who was laying siege to Bristol, the whole\r\ncountry round Plymouth was in the hands of the enemy; and an attack would,\r\nit was feared, be soon made by Lord Goring on the town garrison. Unless\r\nthe siege was raised before winter, or considerable supplies brought in,\r\nthe town would be unable to hold out longer. This petition the municipal\r\nauthorities of London were asked to second, with the hope of prevailing\r\nupon parliament to send at least that relief which had been so often\r\ndesired and so often promised. A whole fortnight elapsed before the letter\r\nand petition were brought to the notice of the Common Council (20\r\nSept.)—the letter from Gloucester had taken a week in transit, such was\r\nthe state of the country—and then it was resolved to send a deputation\r\nfrom the city, including the two sheriffs, to express to the Committee of\r\nBoth Kingdoms the desire of the City that they would be pleased to take\r\nthe petition into speedy and serious consideration, and to provide for the\r\nsafety and defence of Plymouth.(686)\r\n\r\n(M328)\r\n\r\nThe Londoners themselves were suffering from an inconvenience from which\r\nthey had hitherto in vain sought relief from parliament, and that was the\r\nlarge number of royalist soldiers—amounting to no less than 3,000—which\r\nafter the battle of Naseby had been quartered on the city.(687) Now that\r\nthe war was practically over, so far as the king was concerned, the Common\r\nCouncil again took the matter in hand, and it was suggested that the\r\nConvocation House and its cloisters situate on the south side of St.\r\nPaul’s Churchyard should be fitted up at a cost of £40 for their\r\nreception. By this means Bethlehem hospital, where many of the prisoners\r\nhad been housed, would be free to minister again to the wants of the\r\npoor.(688)\r\n\r\n(M329)\r\n\r\nThe troubles with Charles had scarcely terminated before a new struggle\r\ncommenced. A monster had been raised, after much hesitation and with no\r\nlittle difficulty, in the shape of a well-organised and regularly paid\r\narmy, the command of which was virtually in the hands of a small political\r\nparty known as Independents. The great fear was lest this party, with the\r\narmy at its back, should over-ride the wishes of the Presbyterians, a\r\nparty which was numerically stronger than the Independents, both in the\r\nHouse and in the country; and to avoid such a catastrophe the\r\nPresbyterians of England were ready to join hands with their brethren in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n(M330)\r\n\r\nThe House, however, was unfortunate enough at this critical juncture to\r\noffend the Scots as well as the citizens of London. The Scottish army had\r\nbeen invited to march southward to attack Newark, whither Charles had\r\nbetaken himself after witnessing from the walls of Chester the defeat of\r\nhis troops on Rowton Heath (24 Sept.), and the Commons had promised to\r\nraise a sum of £30,000 for its pay provided it arrived before Newark by\r\nthe 1st day of November.(689) This sum the City promised to find (10\r\nOct.), but only on the condition named.(690) On the 13th the House\r\noffended the dignity of the Scots by a series of resolutions protesting\r\nagainst the conduct of the Scottish army in not attacking the enemy as\r\nwell as in levying money on the inhabitants of the northern counties, and\r\ndemanded the removal of the garrisons which had been placed in Newcastle,\r\nCarlisle and other towns without the consent of parliament.(691)\r\n\r\n(M331)\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between parliament and the City was scarcely less serious, and\r\narose out of an attempt to foist a system of Presbyterianism upon the\r\ncitizens which should serve as a model for the rest of the kingdom. It was\r\nnot that the Londoner objected to the principle of Presbyterianism; the\r\nnatural bent of his mind was in that direction, and the City had already\r\npetitioned parliament for the election of elders to join with the parish\r\nministers.(692) What he found fault with was the mode of electing the\r\nelders prescribed by parliament (23 Sept.).(693) The scheme was so far\r\nfrom satisfying the general body of citizens that a number of them\r\npresented a petition to the Common Council to address both Houses of\r\nParliament, with a view to having the powers of the elders sufficiently\r\nenlarged to effect a genuine reform in the Church.(694) They wanted, in\r\nfact, to see parliamentary control over the Church in matters purely\r\necclesiastical withdrawn. Herein they were supported by the ministers of\r\ntheir own parish churches, who drew up a list of reforms they desired to\r\nsee executed and the reasons why they so desired.(695) It was a difficult\r\nmatter on which to approach parliament. Nevertheless, in accordance with a\r\nresolution of the Common Council (18 Nov.), a deputation of aldermen and\r\ncommon councillors, of whom Alderman Gibbs acted as spokesman, presented\r\nthemselves (19 Nov.) before the House of Commons with the petition of the\r\ncitizens, as well as with the \"desires and reasons\" of the city clergy.\r\nThe reply they got was far from encouraging. They were given to understand\r\nthat parliament was well aware of its trust and duty, and was quite able\r\nto discharge both, if only it was let alone, and its purpose not\r\nmisconceived and prejudged as it appeared to have been in the city; and\r\nthey were dismissed with the caution not to form premature opinions about\r\nmatters which were still under discussion.(696) Notwithstanding this\r\nrebuff, the deputation the following day attended before the Lords (20\r\nNov.), who returned them a far more gracious and sympathetic answer. After\r\nthanking the deputation for their expressions of submission to the\r\nresolutions of parliament, their lordships assured them that none should\r\nexcel them in their endeavours for the maintenance of the covenant, the\r\nadvancement and settling of God’s true religion, and the discharge of the\r\ntrust reposed in them.(697)\r\n\r\n(M332)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a deputation from parliament had waited on the Common\r\nCouncil (12 Nov.) with a request for a loan of £6,000 for the troops\r\nengaged in blockading Chester. The court agreed to the request, but\r\nthought it high time to learn precisely how the city stood with respect to\r\nloans already made to parliament, and appointed (17 Nov.) a committee to\r\nreport on the whole matter, with a view of addressing parliament for\r\nre-payment of monies in arrear.(698)\r\n\r\n(M333)\r\n\r\nIt was feared that the Scottish army might change sides. It wanted\r\nsupplies. The City, we have seen, had agreed with parliament to advance a\r\nsum of £30,000 for payment of the Scots, provided their army appeared\r\nbefore Newark by the 1st November. This condition had not been fulfilled.\r\nThe army, nevertheless, appeared later on, and a committee of the House of\r\nCommons came down to the city and asked the citizens (6 Dec.) to stand by\r\ntheir former promise and advance the sum mentioned, which they readily\r\nconsented to do.(699)\r\n\r\n(M334) (M335)\r\n\r\nThe question with Charles was, from whom was he likely to obtain the\r\nbetter terms, the English or the Scots? On the 26th December he addressed\r\na letter to the Speaker of the House of Lords, asking whether the two\r\nHouses of Parliament, the Scottish commissioners, the municipal\r\nauthorities, as well as the militia of the city and the officers of both\r\narmies, would guarantee his personal security if he came to reside in\r\nLondon or Westminster, with a retinue not exceeding three hundred in\r\nnumber, for a period of forty days.(700) The risk of allowing such a step\r\nwas too great. Already the Earl of Holland had been heard to threaten a\r\nroyalist rising in the city if only Charles could be brought in safety to\r\nWestminster. Not getting a reply so quickly as he wished, Charles wrote\r\nagain three days later (29 Dec.) urging his former proposal.(701) More\r\ndelay took place, during which the Commons instructed the mayor to see\r\nwell to the city’s guards and scrutinise the passes of those coming and\r\ngoing,(702) and at last, on the 13th January, the Speakers wrote to\r\nCharles declining the proposal.(703)\r\n\r\n(M336)\r\n\r\nThe day following the despatch of this reply was kept in the city as a day\r\nof solemn humiliation. Sermons were preached before the mayor, aldermen\r\nand members of the common council, who afterwards individually took the\r\noath and covenant. An enquiry was subsequently ordered (9 Feb.) for the\r\npurpose of discovering what members of the common council had failed to\r\ntake the covenant on this occasion, and the reasons why they had not done\r\nso. A few members stood out and refused to renew the covenant, whereupon\r\nthe court resolved to ask parliament for instructions as to what should be\r\ndone with them.(704)\r\n\r\n(M337)\r\n\r\nOn the 15th January Charles made overtures to parliament for the first\r\ntime on the question of religion. He was prepared to allow religion to be\r\nsettled as it was in the reign of Elizabeth and James, \"with full liberty\r\nfor the ease of their consciences who will not communicate in that service\r\nestablished by law, and likewise for the free and public use of the\r\ndirectory prescribed and, by command of the two Houses, now practised in\r\nsome parts of the city of London.\"(705)\r\n\r\n(M338)\r\n\r\nThis important concession on the part of Charles—a concession which only\r\nthe necessities of the time induced him, after much exercise of mind, to\r\nmake—was announced to parliament on the same day that the City presented a\r\npetition(706) against toleration of any other form of religion than the\r\nPresbyterianism already adopted by parliament and the citizens. The\r\npetitioners declared that since they last addressed the Houses on the\r\nsubject of religion a fresh election of the Common Council had taken\r\nplace, and the inhabitants of many of the wards had taken the opportunity\r\nof asking their alderman that parliament might be again desired to settle\r\nChurch government and forbid toleration. Private meetings for religious\r\nworship, they went on to say, were constantly held. In one parish there\r\nwere at least eleven. Orthodox ministers were evil spoken of, as if the\r\ncity were still under the \"tyranny of prelatical government.\" Women had\r\ntaken to preaching, and such blasphemies were uttered as made the\r\npetitioners tremble to think of. Having heard that it was the intention of\r\ndivers persons to petition the House for a toleration of such doctrines as\r\nwere against the covenant under pretext of liberty of conscience, the\r\npetitioners humbly prayed that parliament would take steps to remedy\r\nabuses and to settle the Church government according to the solemn\r\ncovenant made with the most high God. The Commons lent a ready ear to the\r\npetition and thanked the City for their display of piety and religion. It\r\nwas gratifying to them to know that they had the sympathy of the City in\r\ntheir anxiety to settle the peace of the Church.(707) The Lords, to whom a\r\nsimilar petition had been presented, returned an equally gracious message,\r\nand expressed a hope that the municipal authorities would take steps to\r\nremedy the existing abuses.(708)\r\n\r\n(M339)\r\n\r\nWhilst endeavouring to come to terms with parliament Charles was also in\r\ncommunication both with the Scots and the Independents. His purpose was to\r\nplay one party off against the other. A complete understanding existed\r\nbetween the citizens and the Scots on the subject of religion. On the 11th\r\nFebruary the Scottish commissioners themselves appeared at a Common\r\nCouncil bearing a letter from the president of the Scottish parliament\r\naddressed to the lord mayor, aldermen and common council of the city,\r\nthanking them for their zeal for the reformation of religion and\r\nuniformity of Church government, as well as for the large sums of money\r\nadvanced to the armies in defence of religion and the liberty of the\r\nsubject.(709) The Common Council thanked the commissioners for the favour\r\nthus shown, and begged them to assure their countrymen that the City would\r\ncontinue its zeal and affection for the reformation of religion and\r\nuniformity of Church government, and would persevere in its resolution to\r\npreserve the same according to the covenant.\r\n\r\n(M340) (M341)\r\n\r\nAs soon as Parliament heard that the City had received a communication\r\nfrom Scotland the Commons sent a deputation to learn all the particulars\r\nand to ask that the letter might be forwarded to them. The deputation was\r\nto assure the mayor and the Common Council that there was \"no jealousie at\r\nall or dislike of their proceedings\" in the business. In the meanwhile the\r\nHouse called upon Francis Allen, a member of the House as well as a member\r\nof the Common Council, to give an account of what had taken place in the\r\ncity on the 11th. This he did to the best of his ability, giving from\r\nmemory the substance of the letter from Scotland. He then proceeded to say\r\nthat one of the Scottish commissioners, Lord Lauderdale, had made the\r\nfollowing remark before the Common Council, viz., \"That many aspersions\r\nhad been caste upon their armie and their proceedings by malignants; and\r\ndesired that the authors of them might be looked upon as those that\r\nendeavour to disturb the unitie of both kingdomes.\"(710)\r\n\r\n(M342)\r\n\r\nThat at least was the story as recorded in the Journal of the House.\r\nAllen, however, declared that he had been inaccurately recorded, and the\r\nCommon Council, in giving parliament their own version of the matter,\r\ndenied that Lauderdale had made any such remark. He had said nothing that\r\ncould give offence. They forwarded the letter as desired, but begged that\r\nit might be returned in order that it might be entered on the city’s\r\nJournal. They further expressed a wish to print and publish it so that the\r\nreal facts might be known. Allen, they said, was not to be credited, and\r\nhad been guilty of a breach of privilege in what he had done.(711)\r\n\r\n(M343)\r\n\r\nThe House, however, took a different view of Allen’s conduct, and declared\r\nthat he had only done his duty. It at the same time came to a resolution\r\nthat the relation entered on the Journal of the House varied from Allen’s\r\nand ordered it to be expunged.(712)\r\n\r\n(M344)\r\n\r\nThree years later, when Allen was elected alderman of the ward of\r\nFarringdon Without, the House declared (5 Dec, 1649) that it deemed it \"an\r\nacceptable service to the commonwealth\" if Allen would accept the post,\r\nand the Common Council resolved (19 Dec.) to revoke all votes of the court\r\nthat had been passed in the month of February, 1646, reflecting on Allen’s\r\nconduct.(713)\r\n\r\n(M345)\r\n\r\nHitherto the City and Parliament had, in the presence of a common danger,\r\nmutually supported one another; but as soon as the royalists ceased to\r\ngive further cause for alarm differences immediately sprang up. The\r\nquestion of the City’s jurisdiction over the militia raised within the\r\nweekly bills of mortality, as well as over that raised within the city and\r\nliberties, was no new question. It had been raised at least as far back as\r\nAugust, 1644,(714) but during the crisis of the civil war the matter had\r\nbeen allowed to drop until December, 1645, when the City again brought it\r\nforward and urged parliament to acknowledge its jurisdiction.(715) Before\r\nparliament would give its assent it wished to be informed whether the\r\njurisdiction claimed by the City was already vested in the City by Charles\r\nor by custom, and if not, what extension of jurisdiction was it that the\r\nCity now desired?(716) The chief opposition came from the inhabitants of\r\nMiddlesex, Surrey, Southwark and Westminster, who objected to their\r\nmilitia being placed under the command of the mayor, aldermen and common\r\ncouncil of the city. All parties were cited to appear before the Star\r\nChamber on the 31st June, 1646, to support their own contention.(717)\r\nParliament had already (27 Jan.) expressed itself as willing to sanction\r\nthe government of the militia of the city and liberties being vested in\r\nthe municipal authorities and to allow that the city forces should not be\r\ncalled upon to serve away from the city without their own consent,(718)\r\nbut this was not enough. What the City desired was nothing more and\r\nnothing less than what had already been proposed to the king at Oxford\r\nwith the sanction of both Houses, namely, \"the government of the militia\r\nof the parishes without London and the liberties within the weekly bills\r\nof mortality.\" Parliament had made no scruple about the matter at a time\r\nwhen it stood in sore need of assistance from the City; and the City did\r\nnot intend to let it go back lightly on its word.(719)\r\n\r\n(M346)\r\n\r\nA petition was accordingly presented to the House of Commons by alderman\r\nFowke on the 6th February.(720) The petition set out at considerable\r\nlength all the proceedings that had taken place since the question of the\r\nmilitia was first submitted to Charles. It compared the attitude of the\r\ncity towards parliament in the late civil war with the part played by the\r\ncitizens in a previous civil war, viz., the war of the Barons, when\r\n(according to the petitioners) the Barons were eventually beaten out of\r\nthe field owing to the citizens of London staying at home! The petitioners\r\nproceeded to show the necessity of the City being empowered to raise\r\nmilitia in the adjacent counties for the purpose of keeping open a passage\r\nfor victualling the city in times of danger; that since the militia of the\r\nsuburbs had been under the command of the City good service had been\r\nrendered to the parliamentary cause, and notably in the relief of\r\nGloucester; that if it were now removed from the jurisdiction of the City\r\nthe suburban forts might be seized and both the city and parliament might\r\nbe threatened; and that it was for the better preservation of parliament,\r\nand not for the purpose of rendering the city militia independent of\r\nparliament, that the petitioners appeared before the House. Finally,\r\nAlderman Fowke, who acted as spokesman, declared himself authorised to\r\nstate that if the militia of the city and kingdom were not settled by the\r\nking and parliament there would be no course left open to the city\r\nauthorities but to act according to their conscience and to abide by their\r\ncovenant. A similar petition was presented to the House of Lords (7 Feb.).\r\nA week later (14 Feb.) a counter-petition was addressed to the Commons by\r\nthe inhabitants of the Tower Hamlets, Westminster and Southwark,(721) and\r\non the 13th March a committee was appointed to arrange, if possible, a\r\ncompromise.(722)\r\n\r\n(M347)\r\n\r\nBefore this question was settled another had arisen to widen the breach\r\nbetween parliament and the city in the shape of an ordinance for\r\nestablishing a system of Presbyterianism throughout England.(723) One\r\nclause of this ordinance—clause 14—was particularly objectionable as\r\nintroducing the authority of the State into matters of Church government.\r\nCommissioners were to be appointed, of whom nothing was known, to regulate\r\nthe Church in each province. The Common Council, being urged by\r\ninhabitants of the city to oppose a measure so opposed to the Word of\r\nGod,(724) presented petitions to both Houses (to the Lords first, they\r\nhaving not yet assented to clause 14) praying that no officers might be\r\nappointed to exercise any Church censures contrary to the Scriptures, and\r\nthat their appointment might be in accordance with the Word of God.(725)\r\nThe petitions were so badly received by both Houses that the municipal\r\nauthorities took fright, and asked that they might be withdrawn and\r\nexpunged from the Journals of Parliament. Their request was acceded to,\r\nbut only on condition that the petitions were likewise expunged from the\r\nCity’s Records.(726)\r\n\r\n(M348) (M349)\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation between parliament and the city was followed by an\r\ninterchange of courtesies. The royalist army under Hopton had recently\r\nsurrendered to Fairfax in the west of England (14 March), and had been\r\ndisbanded; and the last hope of Charles had vanished in the defeat of\r\nAstley’s troops after a sharp engagement at Stow-on-the-Wold (22 March).\r\n\"You have now done your work\" were the parting words of the veteran\r\ncommander to his soldiers, \"and may go play, unless you will fall out\r\namong yourselves.\"(727) On the 26th March a deputation from both Houses\r\nwaited on the Common Council, and invited the mayor, aldermen and council,\r\nas \"the representative body of the city,\" to attend a public thanksgiving\r\nservice to be held that day week (2 April) at Christ Church, Newgate\r\nStreet. The invitation was graciously accepted, and the City returned the\r\ncompliment by asking both Houses to dine the same day at Grocers’\r\nHall.(728)\r\n\r\n(M350) (M351)\r\n\r\nOn the 19th May, whilst virtually a prisoner in the hands of the Scots,\r\nCharles wrote to the City(729) declaring his readiness to concur in\r\nsettling truth and peace, his desire to have all things speedily concluded\r\nto that end, and his hope that his return to his ancient city might be to\r\nthe satisfaction of parliament and his people. The Commons were angry with\r\nthe civic authorities for opening the king’s letter without their leave,\r\nand returned a curt answer to a remonstrance presented to them by the City\r\ncalling upon them to suppress heresy, to unite with the Scots and to come\r\nto a speedy arrangement with the king.(730) The Lords, to whom a similar\r\nremonstrance had been presented, expressed themselves more graciously.\r\nThey acknowledged the fidelity and constant services of the City to\r\nparliament. They were satisfied with the resolutions of the citizens to\r\nsettle the Protestant religion and to preserve the rights and privileges\r\nof parliament, the liberties of the kingdoms and the person and authority\r\nof his majesty. As for their lord mayor (Thomas Adams), whose character\r\nthe petitioners had declared to have been aspersed by certain members of\r\nthe Commons (for opening the king’s letter without leave?), they (the\r\nLords) held him in high esteem, and declared that nothing had been said or\r\ndone in their House to his prejudice. As soon as they should be informed\r\nof the nature of his grievance they would be found ready in a\r\nparliamentary way to do him right.(731) The Common Council received a\r\nformal address of thanks for presenting this remonstrance from a large\r\nbody of \"citizens of the best rank and qualitie,\" as well as from the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Scotland.(732)\r\n\r\n(M352)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand an attempt was made to minimise the effect of the\r\nremonstrance by getting up a counter-petition on the pretext that the\r\nremonstrance had not fairly represented the wishes of the majority of the\r\ncitizens. This counter-petition, which is said to have been backed up with\r\n5,000 or 6,000 signatures, was duly presented to the Commons, who by a\r\nsmall majority passed a vote of thanks to the petitioners (2 June).(733)\r\n\r\n(M353)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the king’s letter of the 19th May remained unanswered. At\r\nlast, on the 3rd July, an answer—or \"petition\"—was drafted and submitted\r\nto the Common Council for approval. After acknowledging the special favour\r\nof receiving a letter direct from the king, the citizens expressed their\r\ndesire to assure his majesty and the whole world of the continuance of\r\ntheir loyalty in accordance with the terms of their protestation and\r\ncovenant. They prayed him to comply with the propositions for the\r\nsettlement of religion and peace and the maintenance of the union of the\r\ntwo nations which parliament was about to send him, and they expressed an\r\nearnest hope to see him return to his ancient city with honour and\r\njoy.(734)\r\n\r\n(M354)\r\n\r\nThe city fathers were too wary to despatch their petition without first\r\nobtaining leave from parliament. On the following day (4 July), therefore,\r\na deputation of aldermen and members of the council, with Alderman Sir\r\nThomas Foote at its head, presented itself before the House of Lords to\r\nask their leave to despatch the City’s answer to the king. After perusing\r\nthe petition the Lords declared their approval of its being sent to the\r\nking, and courteously acknowledged the action of the citizens in first\r\nsubmitting it to the judgment of their lordships.(735) It was otherwise\r\nwith the Commons, who again returned a churlish reply. The deputation was\r\ngiven to understand that the House had been put to some inconvenience in\r\ngiving them an audience, being busily engaged at the time in pressing\r\nbusiness. The petition, however, was of importance, and would receive\r\ntheir consideration at a convenient time.(736)\r\n\r\n(M355)\r\n\r\nOn Friday the 10th the Commons were pressed for an answer, but they again\r\nput the matter off on the plea of pressure of business. The next day the\r\ndeputation again waited on the House, attended by the city members of\r\nparliament, and about four o’clock in the afternoon received a message\r\nfrom the Commons that the City’s petition was not to be forwarded to the\r\nking, and that \"in convenient time\" they would send and inform the Common\r\nCouncil of their further pleasure. Accordingly two of the city’s members,\r\nSir Thomas Soame and Samuel Vassall, appeared before the council on the\r\n15th, when Vassall declared that he had been commanded by the House to\r\nmake an explanation. In order to avoid mistakes he would read the message\r\nhe was to deliver. The message was to the effect that inasmuch as the\r\npropositions which had been despatched to the king by parliament on the\r\n13th June embraced the city of London as well as the whole kingdom, the\r\nHouse could not approve of the city’s petition being forwarded to his\r\nmajesty. Being desired by the council to leave the paper with them,\r\nVassall declared that he had no authority to do so.(737) In the meantime,\r\nthe House had appointed a committee to enquire \"concerning the first\r\nprincipal contrivers and framers of the city remonstrance, and concerning\r\nsuch as have or do labour to disaffect the people and the city from the\r\nparliament\";(738) but before the committee could take steps to carry out\r\nits instructions, circumstances had arisen which made it advisable to let\r\nthe matter drop and not to widen the breach between the city and\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n(M356)\r\n\r\nOn the 30th July the parliamentary commissioners arrived in Newcastle for\r\nthe purpose of laying before Charles propositions for peace. Charles had\r\nalready become possessed of a copy, and had long since made up his mind to\r\nreject them. The commissioners had received positive orders to allow the\r\nking ten days to give his assent, and if he failed to give his assent\r\nwithin that time after their arrival they were at once to return.(739) The\r\nonly reply which Charles condescended to give was contained in a letter\r\nwhich he handed to the commissioners on the 1st August. The letter was\r\nread before the House on the 12th. It contained little more than vague\r\npromises and a request that he might be allowed to come to London to\r\ndiscuss the propositions at length.(740)\r\n\r\n(M357)\r\n\r\nThe same day that the king’s answer was read before the Lords a letter\r\nfrom the Scottish commissioners was produced, in which they offered to\r\nwithdraw their forces from England upon payment of expenses already\r\nincurred.(741) After a considerable amount of haggling the Scots consented\r\nto take the sum of £400,000 in full discharge of all claims, a moiety to\r\nbe paid to them before leaving England and the remainder by instalments at\r\nspecified dates.(742) It only remained for parliament to raise the sum of\r\n£200,000 needed for the first payment, and to whom was it more natural\r\nthat application should first be made than to the City? A large deputation\r\nfrom the Commons, including Cromwell himself, accordingly waited on the\r\nCommon Council (7 Sept.) to ask it to consider ways and means for raising\r\nthe money. The committee to whom the matter was referred lost no time. On\r\nthe 9th it reported to the court a scheme for raising the money on the\r\nsecurity of the excise and sale of the Bishops’ lands, the security to\r\nextend to previous loans. Parliament accepted these terms, on the\r\nunderstanding that \"Bishops’ lands\" were not to comprise impropriations\r\nand advowsons.(743)\r\n\r\n(M358)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th December there was presented to the Common Council \"an humble\r\nrepresentacon of the pressinge grievances and important desires of the\r\nwell affected freemen and covenant engaged cittizens of the cittie of\r\nLondon,\" with a request that it might be laid before parliament.(744) This\r\ndocument, after being revised by a committee appointed for the purpose,\r\nwas laid before the Commons on the 19th December, together with a petition\r\nfrom the civic authorities themselves, who similarly addressed themselves\r\nto the House of Lords. The chief points on which stress was laid were the\r\ndisbandment of the army, the suppression of heresy, the union of the two\r\nkingdoms, the free election of members of parliament, and the City’s\r\ngovernment of its own militia. As for the \"bringing home of his majesty,\"\r\nthat was left to the wisdom of both Houses, with the confidence that they\r\nwould preserve his majesty’s royal person and authority in defence of the\r\ntrue religion and liberties of the kingdom according to the covenant.(745)\r\nBoth Houses thanked the City and promised to take the matter into their\r\nconsideration.(746)\r\n\r\n(M359)\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the following year (1647) a new terror presented itself\r\nto the Presbyterians at home in the absolute supremacy of the army under\r\nFairfax, although that general had given his word that the army should not\r\ncome within twenty-five miles of London.(747) The City petitioned both\r\nHouses that it might be disbanded, and that the Common Council might have\r\nauthority to make annual election of the members of the city’s militia. To\r\nthose petitions gracious answers were returned, the Lords declaring that\r\nthey had considered already a measure touching the city’s militia and had\r\ntransmitted it to the Commons.(748)\r\n\r\n(M360)\r\n\r\nThe army would in all probability have been disbanded in due course, and\r\nall might have gone well but for the high-handed treatment it received\r\nfrom the Commons. It was proposed to ask the soldiers after disbandment to\r\nvolunteer for service in Ireland. There were, however, considerable\r\narrears of pay due to them, and neither officers nor men would volunteer\r\nuntil they had received some assurance from parliament that they would be\r\npaid all that was due to them. Instead of doing this parliament contented\r\nitself with voting a sum of £200,000, not for satisfying arrears of pay,\r\nbut \"for the service of England and Ireland.\"(749) The soldiers were about\r\nto petition parliament with the sanction of their officers, but such a\r\ncourse was declared by both Houses to be highly improper.(750)\r\n\r\n(M361)\r\n\r\nIt was easier for parliament to vote a sum of £200,000 than to raise that\r\namount. Application was as usual made to the City (6 April).(751) The zeal\r\nof the citizens was excited by the Commons at length passing the ordinance\r\nsent down to them by the Lords for a new militia committee (16\r\nApril).(752) On the following day (17 April) the Common Council was\r\nprepared with a scheme to be submitted to parliament for raising the\r\nmoney. Like other schemes that had gone before, it proposed that\r\nsubscribers to certain former loans should add arrears of interest, and by\r\nmaking a further advance equivalent to the sum total should have the whole\r\nsecured on the sale of lands of bishops and delinquents.(753) Parliament\r\nhesitated at first to allow the lands of delinquents and compositions paid\r\nby them to the committee sitting at Goldsmiths’ Hall to form part of the\r\nsecurity for the loan, but afterwards consented to a moiety of all such\r\ncompositions being added to the security.(754)\r\n\r\n(M362)\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the new militia committee was made a solemn business by\r\nthe citizens. Tuesday, the 27th April, was fixed for the nomination, which\r\nwas preceded by prayer and a sermon in the church of St. Laurence Jewry,\r\nand a formal renewal of the covenant by all present. Thirty-one persons,\r\nthe number prescribed by the ordinance, were nominated, all of them\r\nPresbyterians. Of these seven were aldermen. On the 4th May both Houses\r\nsignified their approval of the city’s nominees, and ordained that any\r\nnine of them, whereof three were to be aldermen and six to be commoners,\r\nshould thenceforth constitute a committee for the militia to order and\r\ndirect the same according to the true meaning and intent of the ordinance\r\nrecently passed.(755)\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new committee was to ask leave of parliament\r\nto raise an additional sum of £20,000 to satisfy the arrears due to the\r\ncity’s forces that had been engaged in guarding the Houses of Parliament,\r\nthe Tower and forts within the lines of communication around the city.\r\nParliament only consented, however, to the sum of £12,000 being raised for\r\nthis purpose.(756)\r\n\r\n(M363)\r\n\r\nThe re-modelling of the city force to the exclusion of everyone tainted\r\nwith independency only served to increase the discontent of the army. It\r\nwas bad enough to find the Presbyterians in parliament joining hands with\r\nthe Presbyterians in the city against the army; it was worse if the city\r\ntrained bands were to receive their arrears of pay whilst the army was\r\nleft out in the cold. An attempt was made to bring pressure to bear on\r\nparliament by a mob of reformadoes or disbanded soldiers besetting the\r\nHouse of Commons on the 7th June. These men clamoured for their arrears of\r\npay and refused to go away unless the sum of £10,000 should be voted for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n(M364)\r\n\r\nOn the following day (8 June) the City presented another petition to\r\nparliament praying that the army might be paid off as speedily as\r\npossible; that the king, who had recently been carried off from Holmby\r\nHouse by a troop of cavalry under Joyce, might be disposed of in such a\r\nway as to allow the parliaments of England and Scotland free access to\r\nhim; and thirdly that, seeing the danger of the times, an ordinance of the\r\n17th January, 1645, authorising the City to raise cavalry in their own\r\ndefence and to apprehend disaffected persons, might be revived. The House,\r\nwhich was guarded at the time by a city regiment, could scarcely do\r\notherwise than comply with the prayer of the petitioners.(757)\r\n\r\n(M365)\r\n\r\nThree days later (11 June) a letter was brought to the city by \"two\r\nmessengers that looked like soldiers,\" signed by Fairfax and twelve\r\nothers, informing the civic authorities of the army’s approach to\r\nLondon.(758) The City was asked to believe that such action on the part of\r\nthe army was only directed against those who were endeavouring to engage\r\nthe kingdom in a new war. As Englishmen, if not as soldiers, the writers\r\ndesired only \"the peace of the kingdom and liberty of the subject,\r\naccording to the votes and declarations of parliament.\" They desired no\r\nalteration of the civil government, nor to hinder Presbyterianism. When\r\nonce the State had settled a matter there was nothing for it but to submit\r\nor suffer; they only wished that every good citizen and every peaceful man\r\nmight be allowed to enjoy liberty. \"These, in brief,\" continued the\r\nwriters, \"are our desires, and the things for which we stand, beyond which\r\nwe shall not go; and for obtaining these things we are drawing near your\r\ncity, professing sincerely from our hearts we intend not evil toward you;\r\ndeclaring with all confidence and assurance that if you appear not against\r\nus in these our just desires to assist that wicked party that would\r\nembroil us and the kingdom, nor we nor our soldiers shall give you the\r\nleast offence.\" It was true, they went on to say, that a rich city like\r\nLondon offered a tempting bait for poor hungry soldiers, but the officers\r\nwould protect it with their last drop of blood from the soldiery provided\r\nno provocation were offered by the citizens themselves. Their men valued\r\ntheir own high character above any wealth, and the citizens would act like\r\nfellow subjects and brethren by using their influence with parliament on\r\ntheir behalf. On the other hand, \"if after all this you, or a considerable\r\npart of you, be seduced to take up arms in opposition to or hindrance of\r\nthese our just undertakings, we hope by this brotherly premonition, to the\r\nsincerity thereof we call God to witness, we have freed ourselves from all\r\nthat ruin which may befall that great and populous city, having thereby\r\nwashed our hands thereof.\"\r\n\r\n(M366)\r\n\r\nThis letter was laid before the House with a request that it would\r\nendeavour to prevent Fairfax quartering his army on the city, thereby\r\nenhancing the price of provisions, and this request was acceded to. At the\r\nsame time a new committee of safety, composed of members of both Houses,\r\nwas appointed to join the reformed Committee of Militia of the city in\r\ntaking all necessary steps to secure \"the safety of the parliament and the\r\ncity.\"(759) The committee established itself at the Guildhall and\r\ncommenced preparing lists of disbanded officers willing to serve the\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n(M367)\r\n\r\nThe City in the meantime drafted a reply(760) of its own, and this was\r\ndespatched to the army on the 12th, after receiving the approval of the\r\nHouse. In it the City disavowed any animosity towards the army. The\r\ncitizens had only put themselves into a state of defence against unlawful\r\nviolence. So far were they from opposing the just demands of the army,\r\nthey had themselves presented a humble address to parliament that these\r\nmight be granted. If the officers would only keep the army at a distance\r\nof thirty miles from London, and so give no occasion for disorder or rise\r\nin the price of victuals in the city, it would go far to prove the\r\nsincerity of the intentions expressed in their letter.\r\n\r\n(M368)\r\n\r\nThis letter found the army at St. Albans. The deputation that carried it\r\nthither returned with two missives, one addressed to the commissioners of\r\nthe city of London and the other to the mayor, aldermen and Common\r\nCouncil.(761) In the first Fairfax and the \"council of war\" declared the\r\nutter impossibility of removing the army to a distance of thirty miles\r\nfrom London so long as enlistments were being made in the city and suburbs\r\nin addition to the usual trained bands and auxiliaries. A stop must be put\r\nto this, otherwise the army would have to take the matter in hand. In the\r\nsecond the officers informed the civic authorities that the movements of\r\nthe army would greatly depend upon the action parliament took with respect\r\nto certain \"papers\" now to be submitted to it.\r\n\r\n(M369)\r\n\r\nBy \"papers\" the writers were referring to a document styled _The\r\nDeclaration of the Army_, which had that morning been placed in the hands\r\nof the parliamentary commissioners to be forwarded to the Lords.(762) This\r\ndeclaration sought to establish the right of the army to speak in the name\r\nof the English people, and demanded the banishment from office of all who\r\nspoke ill of it. To this was added a further demand, viz., the expulsion\r\nfrom the House of those who had proved themselves unworthy of their seats.\r\nThis last demand was followed by a formal charge laid in the name of the\r\narmy against eleven members of the House of Commons (of whom Glyn, the\r\ncity’s Recorder, was one) of having prejudiced the liberties of the\r\nsubject, misrepresented the army and raised forces for a new war.\r\n\r\n(M370)\r\n\r\nAs matters turned out the army had little cause to fear the enlistments\r\nthat had taken place in the city. An attempt had, it is true, been made to\r\nincrease the number of the militia, but it had met with poor success. When\r\nit became known in the city that the army was moving southward from\r\nRoyston something like a panic prevailed. The trained bands were called\r\nout on pain of death and shops ordered to be shut, Sir John Gayer, the\r\nlord mayor, being especially active. But when the companies appeared on\r\nparade they were found to be lamentably deficient in numbers, \"not ten men\r\nof some companies appeared, and many companies none at all but\r\nofficers.\"(763) The whole affair was treated as a farce by the on-lookers,\r\nwho jeered at the troops as they passed; and those who had shut up their\r\nshops at the mayor’s command soon opened them again. It was clear that the\r\ncitizens had no intention of being engaged in a \"new war.\" Parliament,\r\nfinding this to be the case, annulled the order for enlistments and\r\nresolved that \"the city might upon occasion send letters to the army, so\r\nas they did first present them to the House for their approbation.\"(764)\r\n\r\n(M371)\r\n\r\nBy the 18th June the City was ready with its reply to the last letters of\r\nFairfax and the council of war. This reply had after some hesitation\r\nreceived the sanction of the Commons, and the City was to be thenceforth\r\npermitted to correspond with the army on its own responsibility, and\r\nwithout submitting its letters first to parliament.(765) It entirely\r\ndisavowed any privity or consent of the Common Council in connection with\r\nthe recent enlistments other than those of the trained bands and\r\nauxiliaries. All such enlistments Fairfax was assured had now been\r\nstopped, the civic authorities having intervened as requested. The City’s\r\nreadiness to conform to the wishes of the army would, it was hoped, draw\r\nforth a fuller assurance that the army intended no prejudice either to\r\nparliament or to the city, which had expended so much blood and treasure\r\nin its defence, and that it would remove its quarters farther from\r\nLondon.(766)\r\n\r\n(M372)\r\n\r\nThis reply did not give unqualified satisfaction. It was impossible, wrote\r\nFairfax and the council of war (21 June),(767) to remove the army farther\r\nfrom London until parliament should have given a satisfactory reply to the\r\n_Humble Representation of the dissatisfaction of the Army_, the\r\n_Declaration of the Army_, and the _Charge_ made against eleven members of\r\nthe House of Commons. That the City had done its part in stopping\r\nenlistments they readily acknowledged, but information had reached them of\r\nunderhand workings still going on to enlist men, as a \"foundation for a\r\nnew armie and a new warre.\" The letter concluded with a reiteration of the\r\nwriters’ intention to do nothing prejudicial to the parliament or the\r\ncity, for which they professed \"a most tender regard.\" To this letter a\r\npostscript was added the following day (22 June) to the effect that since\r\nwriting the above they had heard that parliament had been again threatened\r\nby a mob of reformadoes. It was therefore more necessary than ever to\r\npreserve the remnant of liberty that attached to the House.\r\n\r\n(M373)\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd another letter(768) was despatched desiring that some\r\nrepresentatives of the city might take up permanent quarters with the army\r\nuntil matters became more settled. Accordingly, on the following day (24\r\nJune) the Common Council appointed Alderman Warner, Deputy Pack and\r\nColonel Player to go to Fairfax and the army and remain with them until\r\nfurther orders. They were to give his excellency and the council of war an\r\naccount of the true state of affairs respecting enlistments, and assure\r\nthem that the City would take good care that both Houses should be allowed\r\nto conduct their affairs in peace and quiet.(769)\r\n\r\n(M374)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the commissioners arrived in camp they were informed that the\r\narmy was about to change its quarters to Uxbridge. On the 25th Fairfax\r\nagain took occasion in a letter to the City, dated from\r\nBerkhampstead,(770) to enlarge upon the danger that was likely to arise\r\nfrom continued attempts to raise forces in Wales, \"besides underhand\r\nworkings in your city,\" and from parliament being threatened by the\r\npresence of reformadoes. It could not be expected that the kingdom would\r\nbe safe, or justice done, so long as the accused members sat as judges.\r\n\"We have written this to you,\" the letter concluded, \"for your\r\nsatisfaction that so nothing may be done without giving you a perfect\r\naccount of our intentions and ends, and still to continue our assurance to\r\nyou that should necessity bring us nearer to the city our former faith\r\ngiven you shall be observed inviolably, there being nothing more (next the\r\ngood of the kingdom) in our thoughts and desires than the prosperity of\r\nyour city.\" It was six o’clock in the evening when this letter was brought\r\nto the Common Council, so that there was only time to acknowledge its\r\nreceipt in a letter, which was on the point of being despatched to the\r\narmy.(771)\r\n\r\n(M375)\r\n\r\nAs far as the removal of the objectionable members of the House went\r\nFairfax soon had his way. For, notwithstanding the Commons having declared\r\non the 25th that they saw no valid reason for suspending the members, the\r\nmembers themselves solved the difficulty on the following day by asking\r\nleave of absence, which the House was willing enough to grant.(772)\r\n\r\n(M376)\r\n\r\nThe bands of reformadoes which infested the city presented a greater\r\ndifficulty. On the 2nd July the City once more addressed itself to\r\nparliament in the form of a petition suggesting a remedy for this\r\ngrievance, and although the petition reflected strongly upon the\r\nmismanagement of affairs by the government, and ventured to prescribe\r\nrules for its better regulation, it was more favourably received than\r\nothers of a far less bold character had formerly been.(773) The temper of\r\nthe House must indeed have changed when it could listen calmly to charges\r\nof malversation of money collected for the disbandment of the army, and to\r\nsuch advice as that parliament should \"improve its time\" and busy itself\r\nonly with such laws as might settle the government of the Church, secure\r\nthe people from unlawful and arbitrary power, and restore his majesty to\r\nhis just rights and authority, according to the covenant. A few months ago\r\nany deputation that dared to address the House in these terms would have\r\nbeen sharply dismissed. Times had changed; and now, instead of a rebuke,\r\nthe City received thanks for its \"constant very good affections,\" and a\r\nday was appointed for taking the petition into consideration.\r\n\r\n(M377)\r\n\r\nA week later (8 July) Fairfax wrote to the City from Reading—whither he\r\nhad removed the headquarters of the army (3 July) upon certain concessions\r\nbeing made by parliament—enclosing a copy of a paper which he had\r\nforwarded to parliament setting forth the obstacles which still stood in\r\nthe way of a peaceful settlement, viz., the continued presence of\r\nreformadoes in and about London, as well of the army raised for Ireland\r\nbut not despatched there, and the non-expulsion from the House of those\r\nmembers who had aided the king against parliament.(774) At length\r\nparliament gave way. On the 9th the Commons passed an ordinance expelling\r\nall members who had favoured the king’s cause since the beginning of the\r\nwar,(775) and the Lords passed another ordinance for all disbanded\r\nsoldiers to quit London.(776)\r\n\r\n(M378)\r\n\r\nMatters were not improved by the action of the apprentices of London, who,\r\nlike the rest of the inhabitants, took sides with king or parliament.\r\nParliament had recently sanctioned a monthly holiday to all apprentices.\r\nThe first of these holidays fell on Tuesday, the 13th July. Grateful for\r\nthis concession, a number of lads employed the day in presenting a\r\npetition to the Commons calling upon them to uphold their own authority,\r\nrecall those who had been so unreasonably expelled, protect the clergy,\r\nand bring prisoners to a speedy trial.(777) This was more than the\r\nroyalist apprentices could stand, so the next day they had their turn, and\r\npresented a petition to both Houses praying for the suppression of\r\nconventicles, the restoration of the king, the maintenance of the\r\ncovenant, and the disbandment of the army.(778) This last petition roused\r\nthe indignation of the army, and was one of the motives which led the\r\n\"agitators\"(779) to demand of the council of war an immediate march on\r\nLondon, a step which would most certainly have been undertaken but for the\r\nstrenuous opposition of Cromwell and Ireton.(780)\r\n\r\n(M379)\r\n\r\nA week later (21 July) a mob of apprentices, reformadoes, watermen and\r\nother disaffected persons met at Skinners’ Hall, and one and all signed a\r\nSolemn Engagement pledging themselves to maintain the Covenant and to\r\nprocure the king’s restoration to power on the terms offered by him on the\r\n12th May last, viz., the abandonment of the episcopacy for three years and\r\nthe militia for ten. An endeavour was made to enlist the support of the\r\nmunicipal authorities to this engagement, but a letter from Fairfax (23\r\nJuly) soon gave them to understand that the army looked on the matter as\r\none \"set on foot by the malice of some desperate-minded men, this being\r\ntheir last engine for the putting all into confusion when they could not\r\naccomplish their wicked ends by other means.\"(781) On the 24th both Houses\r\njoined in denouncing the Solemn Engagement of the City, their declaration\r\nagainst it being ordered to be published by beat of drum and sound of\r\ntrumpet through London and Westminster, and within the lines of\r\ncommunication.(782) Anyone found subscribing his name to the engagement\r\nafter such publication would be adjudged guilty of high treason.\r\n\r\n(M380)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the army council had forwarded (19 July) certain\r\nrecommendations to the city which they proposed to submit to parliament,\r\namong them being one for removing the command of the city’s militia out of\r\nthe hands of the municipal authorities and vesting it in parliament.(783)\r\nThis proposal was accepted in due course by both Houses.(784)\r\n\r\n(M381) (M382) (M383)\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 24th July, the day after the Lords had given their assent\r\nto the proposal touching the militia, two petitions were presented to the\r\nCommon Council praying it to take steps for retaining the militia in the\r\nhands of the city committee.(785) Both petitions were well received by the\r\ncourt, and a draft of another petition from the court itself was at once\r\nmade for presentation to both Houses on the following Monday, together\r\nwith the petitions presented to the court. The sheriffs and the whole\r\ncourt, or as many of them as could go, with the exception of those\r\nactually serving on the militia committee, were ordered to carry the\r\npetitions to Westminster. When Monday came an excited crowd of apprentices\r\nand others followed the sheriffs and members of the Common Council up to\r\nthe very doors of the Houses. The few Peers who were in attendance on that\r\nday were soon brought to pass a resolution abrogating the recent\r\nordinance.(786) When the turn of the Commons came they made a bolder\r\nstand. The consideration of the petitions was frequently interrupted by\r\ncries of \"Vote! vote!\" from the apprentices, who stood at the open doorway\r\nwith their hats on.(787) Hostile as the city was, the House had no means\r\nof restoring order without its aid. The civic authorities showed no\r\nparticular haste in complying with a request for assistance. The Common\r\nCouncil assembled in the afternoon, but all it did was to agree that the\r\nmembers present should adjourn in a body to Westminster \"and use their\r\nbest endeavour by all gentle ways and means possible they can to appease\r\nthe said multitude and to free the said House from danger.\"(788) At\r\nlength, towards eight o’clock in the evening, the Commons, worn-out and\r\nexhausted, yielded to the pressure put upon them and repealed the\r\nobnoxious ordinance, after which the mob was content to obey the city\r\ncouncillors and quietly disperse.\r\n\r\n(M384) (M385)\r\n\r\nThe civic authorities having recovered its control over the militia\r\nimmediately began to put the city in a posture of defence. In this it was\r\nassisted by the apprentices offering their services, their lives and\r\nfortunes against any power whatsoever that should attack the city. The\r\nCommon Council thanked them for their good will, and desired them to carry\r\nthemselves in an orderly and regular way, and endeavour to prevent\r\ndisorder and tumult.(789) There were already rumours that the army had\r\nbroken up and was marching towards London. No time was to be lost if the\r\ncity was to be saved from falling into its hands. The militia committee\r\nwas ordered to draw up a declaration in justification of all that the\r\ncivic authorities had done, whilst a letter was sent (28 July) to Fairfax\r\ndeprecating any attempt by the army to \"intermeddle\" with the liberties or\r\nprivileges of the city or to interpose in the matter of the militia, which\r\nshould be used only in defence of parliament and the city without giving\r\noccasion for offence to anyone. He was assured that now the government of\r\nthe militia had become revested in the city there would be no more\r\ndisorder.(790) The day on which this letter was despatched had been set\r\napart by the civic authorities as a day of fasting and humiliation. Three\r\nministers were appointed to pray and preach before the mayor, aldermen and\r\ncommon council at the church of St. Michael Bassishaw that God might turn\r\naway his wrathful indignation against the city and the nation.(791)\r\n\r\n(M386) (M387)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Fairfax had been informed of the terrorism brought to bear\r\nupon parliament, and wrote (29 July) from Bedford to the Common\r\nCouncil(792) saying that, for his part, he looked upon them, being in\r\nauthority, as responsible to the kingdom for the recent disturbances. The\r\nletter reached the council at eleven o’clock at night. In spite of the\r\nlateness of the hour an answer was drawn up(793) disclaiming any\r\nresponsibility for the riot at Westminster on the ground that at the time\r\nthe city was without a settled militia and held no commission on which to\r\nact. So far from having encouraged the tumult, as many of the council had\r\nbeen reported to have done, they had used their best endeavours to allay\r\nit. In conclusion the council declared themselves unconscious of having\r\ncontributed to the interruption of the \"hopeful way of peace and\r\nsettlement\" mentioned in the general’s letter, and would accordingly rely\r\nupon God for His protection over the city.\r\n\r\n(M388)\r\n\r\nThe time for negotiations had clearly passed away, and there was no other\r\nrecourse but to repel force by force. The Common Council immediately voted\r\n(29 July) a sum of £20,000 on the security of the city seal for the\r\npurposes of defence.(794) The trained bands were sent to man the works,\r\nand orders were given for a general muster to be held on the following\r\nmorning of all the inhabitants who were not members of the trained bands\r\nbut were capable of bearing arms.(795)\r\n\r\n(M389)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament re-assembled on the 30th the Speakers of the two Houses\r\nand a number of members failed to appear. New Speakers were immediately\r\nappointed and the expelled members ordered to take their seats. One of the\r\nfirst acts of the House was to authorise the militia committee to seize\r\nall horses within the lines of communication for the defence of parliament\r\nand the City, and in accordance with the City’s request sent word to\r\nFairfax not to approach within thirty miles of London.(796)\r\n\r\n(M390)\r\n\r\nOn the following day (31 July) the House signified its assent to the\r\nappointment of Massey as commander-in-chief of the city forces, in\r\naccordance with the desire of the militia committee and the Common\r\nCouncil, and informed a city deputation that it had taken the precaution\r\nto secure the Block-houses at Tilbury and Gravesend. On hearing this some\r\nof the deputation expressed a hope that the House would also see to\r\nWindsor Castle.(797)\r\n\r\n(M391) (M392)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council was getting more and more anxious every day. Fairfax\r\nhad disdained giving any reply to their last letters, and the army was\r\nknown to have already advanced as near as Colnbrook. On the afternoon of\r\nthe 2nd August the council resolved to send another letter to the general,\r\ndisclaiming any intention on the part of the city to raise a new war. The\r\ndelivery of this despatch was entrusted to six aldermen and twelve\r\ncommoners, who were to remain with the army, in addition to the\r\ncommissioners previously appointed, and use every means in their power to\r\nprevent any further bloodshed. If Fairfax complained that the city was\r\nengaged in raising a body of horse, they were instructed to throw the\r\nresponsibility on parliament. If he objected to the drilling of\r\nreformadoes, it was again the work of parliament and not of the militia\r\ncommittee. If the commissioners were asked for some assurance that the\r\ncity would protect parliament in future from all attacks, they were to say\r\nthat the city would do its best to protect not only the sitting members,\r\nbut all who should return to the House. If objection was raised to the\r\nappointment of Massey, it was to be laid to the sudden approach of the\r\narmy. Should any question arise as to the recent riot at Westminster, the\r\nwhole affair was to be ascribed to the absence of any settled authority of\r\nthe city militia; and lastly, if the matter of the petition and engagement\r\nwas raked up, the commissioners were to say that the city had not been the\r\npromoters.(798) Furnished with these instructions, the commissioners set\r\nout for the army, which they found the next day (3 Aug.) drawn up on\r\nHounslow Heath.\r\n\r\n(M393)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime another declaration(799) had been prepared by Fairfax and\r\nthe council of war recapitulating the course affairs had taken, the\r\nchanges that had taken place in the government of the city militia, the\r\npressure that had been put upon parliament resulting in the Speakers and\r\nmany members being driven away, and the continued presence of the eleven\r\nmembers in the House after charges had been brought against them, and\r\nsignifying the intention of the army to give a welcome to all members of\r\nparliament who found themselves unable to take their seats at Westminster\r\nwith freedom and safety, and to regard them as persons in whom the public\r\ntrust of the kingdom still remained. It was moreover the purpose of the\r\narmy to march on London, when it was expected the eleven members would be\r\neither delivered up or else kept in custody until they could be brought to\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n(M394)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the city commissioners arrived at headquarters this declaration\r\nwas put into their hands, and with it they hurried back to London in time\r\nto lay it before the Common Council the same afternoon. The council was\r\nquick to discern that no other course lay open to them but submission. A\r\nletter(800) was accordingly despatched to Fairfax the same night, to the\r\neffect that, as it appeared from the declaration that the main object of\r\nthe army drawing so near London was to bring back to a free parliament at\r\nWestminster those members who had withdrawn owing to the tumult on the\r\n26th July, the Common Council heartily concurred therein, and no\r\nopposition whatever would be shown to the troops appointed to escort the\r\nmembers to Westminster. The City declared itself ready to submit to\r\nparliament in everything, and offered its entire force for its protection.\r\nIn order to remove all cause of offence or misunderstanding, the City’s\r\nown declaration(801) recently published (30 July) was withdrawn. Under\r\nthese circumstances the council expressed a hope that the army would be\r\nprevented from doing any offence or prejudice to the city or the lines of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n(M395)\r\n\r\nThe City was now all submission. On the 4th August it agreed to a demand\r\nto surrender the forts from \"Giles Forte\" down to the river-side, and the\r\nCommon Council wrote to Fairfax to that effect, saying that \"now, next\r\nunto Almighty God, we do rely upon your excellencye’s honourable word for\r\nour safety, and to be protected from all violence of the soldiery.\"(802)\r\nBy that time Fairfax had arrived with the army at Hammersmith, whence he\r\nwrote to the City acknowledging their ready compliance in the surrender of\r\nthe forts, which he would shortly garrison, and assuring them that the\r\narmy would behave itself in such a manner \"as to witness to the world the\r\nintegrity of their hearts in having no other design but the quiet and\r\nhappy settlement of a firm and lasting peace.\"(803)\r\n\r\n(M396)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th August the army entered the lines of fortification and made its\r\nway to Westminster, accompanied by the Speakers of both Houses and those\r\nmembers who had betaken themselves to the army after withdrawing from\r\nparliament. The civic authorities, taking advantage of the hint offered\r\nthem, welcomed the army on its approach, the mayor and aldermen going out\r\nas far as Hyde Park in coaches, whilst the Common Council betook\r\nthemselves to Charing Cross by water, and there ranged themselves in view\r\nof the soldiers as they passed.(804) Glyn, the Recorder, on whose behalf\r\nthe City had already addressed Fairfax, was instructed to make a speech\r\nwith the view of absolving the City from any implication in the tumult of\r\nthe 26th July.\r\n\r\n(M397) (M398)\r\n\r\nOn the following day (7 Aug.) the citizens made a closer acquaintance with\r\nthe army as it marched through the heart of the city on its way to\r\nCroydon. The words of Fairfax proved true. The troops marched through the\r\nstreets \"with all civility, not doing the least hurt or prejudice.\" The\r\ncivic authorities felt so much relief at seeing this unexpected\r\nmaintenance of discipline that they gave vent to their feelings by asking\r\nFairfax and all the officers to meet them at dinner at Grocers’ Hall on\r\nThursday, the 13th, but that day proving inconvenient to the general, who\r\nwas busy settling the affairs of the army, the dinner was ordered to be\r\nput off until the city should again hear from him.(805) The termination of\r\nhostilities gave rise to the following poetical ebullition on the part of\r\n_Mercurius Pragmaticus_:—\r\n\r\n\"A Peace, a Peace, the countrey cries,\r\n  Or else we shall be undone;\r\nFor this brave warre we thank the wise\r\n  Confiding men of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure now they may as well as we\r\n  Know how to value Quiet,\r\nWhen th’ army comes their Guests to be\r\n  For a twelve-month’s Cash and Diet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M399)\r\n\r\nThe City was now powerless. The day of reckoning had come, and the City\r\nhad to pay for the opposition it had displayed towards the army. The Tower\r\nwas no longer entrusted to the citizens, but was committed by parliament\r\nto Fairfax as constable.(806) Diligent search was made for reformadoes\r\nwith the intention of making an example of some of them,(807) and a\r\ncommittee consisting of members of both Houses was appointed to enquire\r\ninto the violence recently offered to parliament.(808) The Town Clerk\r\nreceived orders to produce to the committee all such books of the city as\r\ncontained the Acts and Orders of the Common Council passed and made from\r\nthe 20th July until the 6th August, as well as the original petitions of\r\nwhich copies had been presented to the Commons on the memorable 26th July,\r\nand other documents.(809)\r\n\r\n(M400)\r\n\r\nThe cry raised by the agitators of the army for the expulsion of the\r\neleven members from parliament became so great that six of the number\r\nthought it advisable to make their escape to the continent.(810) Of those\r\nthat remained to face the worst in England, Glyn, the city’s Recorder, was\r\none. It was in vain that the Common Council, who upheld the conduct of\r\ntheir officer, interceded with Fairfax and invoked the aid of friends in\r\nboth Houses on his behalf.(811) He was expelled the House and committed to\r\nthe Tower, one week only being allowed him to put his papers and affairs\r\nin order.(812)\r\n\r\n(M401) (M402)\r\n\r\nOn the 24th August a deputation of the committee of the army waited on the\r\nCommon Council and demanded an advance of a month’s pay (£50,000). The\r\nCity was to re-imburse itself out of the arrears which the citizens had\r\nfailed to contribute to the army, and which amounted to over £60,000. The\r\nmatter was referred to a committee.(813) Ten days elapsed and parliament\r\nbecame impatient for an answer.(814) The City was told (4 Sept.) that its\r\n\"engagement\" of the 21st July had been the occasion of the army\r\napproaching London, and its failing to pay the money as it became due was\r\nthe occasion of keeping the army near London. If the citizens failed to\r\ntake the necessary steps for the removal of the army, \"they must expect to\r\nsuffer the inconveniences that will come hereby.\"(815) To this the City\r\nreplied (6 Sept.) that whatever arrears of assessments were due they were\r\nnot due from the Common Council as a body, for that had never been\r\nassessed, but were due from particular individuals. The council feared\r\nthat it would be impossible to raise the money on the security offered,\r\nbut it promised to use its best endeavours to raise it if some better\r\nsecurity were found, and to get in arrears of assessments at the same\r\ntime. As to the \"engagement,\" they called God to witness that the Common\r\nCouncil as a body had had no hand in it; but as soon as a copy of it was\r\nreceived from the army, the council returned answer that \"according to\r\ntheir duty they did rest in that which both Houses of Parliament had\r\nresolved hereupon.\" In that resolution the council expressed itself as\r\nstill remaining and altogether disavowed the \"engagement.\" It even\r\nventured to hope that the House would not permit such a mark of its\r\ndispleasure to remain on record, reflecting so badly as it did upon the\r\nwhole City.(816)\r\n\r\n(M403) (M404)\r\n\r\nThis reply being deemed unsatisfactory the Commons sent a more peremptory\r\ndemand (9 Sept.) to the effect that not only the sum of £50,000 should be\r\nadvanced by the City before the 18th September, but that also the whole of\r\nthe arrears, amounting to £64,000, should be levied,(817) and they got\r\nFairfax himself to write and back up their demand for £50,000. The letter\r\nof Fairfax was dated from Putney on the 6th September, but it was not\r\ncommunicated to the Common Council until Saturday the 11th, a court which\r\nhad been specially summoned for the previous day (Friday) having been\r\nadjourned for want of a _quorum_.(818) To this letter was appended the\r\nfollowing postscript:—\"We understand itts neare a fortnight since the\r\ncommittee applied themselves to you in this busines, and that yet nothing\r\nis done, we desire there may be a present performance, the condicon of the\r\narmie not admitting any longer delay.\"\r\n\r\n(M405)\r\n\r\nTo the Commons the City made answer (13 Sept.) that arrears were already\r\nbeing got in as speedily as possible, and asked that the hands of the\r\ncollectors might be strengthened by additional parliamentary powers.(819)\r\nTo Fairfax a long letter was sent the same day explaining the reason of\r\nthe delay that had occurred in satisfying the demand of parliament, and\r\ninforming him of the steps that were being taken to get in the arrears due\r\nto the army.(820)\r\n\r\n(M406)\r\n\r\nThe excuses put forward were considered to be of so unsatisfactory and\r\ntemporising a character that Fairfax and the General Council of the Army\r\nproposed to parliament, that unless the arrears came in by a certain day\r\nthe general himself should be authorised to levy them and to inflict fines\r\nupon delinquents. This withholding the money by the City, said they, was\r\nbut a scheme for bringing the army into disrepute, and for the purpose of\r\ncausing disturbance; the Common Council had been ready enough to advance\r\nfar larger sums to encourage designs against parliament and the army; it\r\nmight again be induced to show a similar readiness in providing money,\r\nwithout which the army could not disperse, if parliament would but impose\r\na fine upon them as a body, \"which money being chargeable so properly upon\r\nthemselves, we presume they will not have the like excuse not to\r\nprovide.\"(821)\r\n\r\n(M407) (M408) (M409)\r\n\r\nBefore any further steps were taken to enforce the loan the committee\r\nappointed to investigate the outrage upon parliament in July reported (24\r\nSept.) to the House that they had discovered sufficient evidence for the\r\nimpeachment of Sir John Gayer, the mayor, Thomas Cullum, one of the\r\nsheriffs, and three aldermen of the city, viz., James Bunce, John Langham\r\nand Thomas Adams, on the charge of threatening the Commons with force and\r\nraising a fresh war.(822) The House at once accepted the committee’s\r\nreport and ordered the accused parties to the Tower. On the following day\r\nit took into consideration the question as to how the city government was\r\nto be carried on in the absence of the mayor, and resolved to refer the\r\nmatter to the rest of the aldermen who happened to be in London at the\r\ntime, so that the civil government might continue \"according to the\r\ncharters, custom or usage of the city in like cases.\"(823) But on the 27th\r\nit was left to Alderman Pennington, in whom both Houses had confidence, to\r\nsummon a Court of Aldermen and to direct that a Common Hall should be\r\nforthwith called for the purpose of electing someone to serve as mayor\r\n\"until the 29th October next, or until Sir John Gayer should be either\r\nsentenced or acquitted.\"(824) The customary day for election (29 Sept.)\r\nhaving been appointed a solemn fast, the election took place by order of\r\nthe Common Council on the 28th September,(825) when Alderman Warner, a\r\nstrong Independent, was chosen mayor, the approaches to the Guildhall\r\nbeing guarded at the time of the election by a strong body of\r\nsoldiers.(826) In the absence of the king, and there being no chancellor\r\nor lord keeper, the new mayor was presented to the House of Lords (30\r\nSept.), which approved of the city’s choice and gave orders that the\r\ncustomary oaths should be administered to him in the exchequer as well as\r\nin the city.(827) On the 6th October an ordinance excluding delinquents\r\nfrom all municipal offices or from voting at municipal elections finally\r\nreceived the approval of both Houses.(828)\r\n\r\n(M410)\r\n\r\nA letter from Fairfax, dated at Kingston the 19th November,(829)\r\nthreatening to quarter 1,000 men on the city to assist the municipal\r\nauthorities in getting in arrears of assessments due to the army, created\r\nno little alarm in the city. Whilst the Common Council was deliberating on\r\nthe matter news was brought that the Earl of Northumberland and a\r\ndeputation from both Houses were waiting without the Council Chamber\r\ndesiring to speak with some members of the court. A similar intimation to\r\nthat contained in the letter of Fairfax had been made to parliament, and\r\nboth Houses were anxious to urge upon the city the extreme importance of\r\nanticipating such a step as that which Fairfax threatened by getting in\r\nthe arrears of assessments as speedily as possible. This the council\r\nexpressed itself as very willing to do if parliament would relieve the\r\ncollectors of certain pains and penalties recently imposed on them, which\r\nhad only served to render them the more unwilling to execute their\r\nduties.(830)\r\n\r\n(M411)\r\n\r\nA little respite was granted(831) whilst the municipal authorities drew up\r\na reply to Fairfax.(832) They expressed great regret if the arrears due\r\nfrom the City to the army, or anything else connected with the City,\r\nshould be the cause of the army continuing so long in the vicinity of\r\nLondon, to the great prejudice if not to the ruin of many. They were doing\r\nall they could to get in the arrears, and they called the general’s\r\nattention to certain proposals which they were about to submit to\r\nparliament. They concluded by assuring Fairfax that the City was\r\ndetermined to remain faithful to parliament and the kingdom, and at the\r\nsame time to cultivate good relations with the army.\r\n\r\n(M412)\r\n\r\nThe City’s proposals, which were submitted to parliament on the 22nd\r\nNovember, met with little favour in the House of Commons. The deputation\r\npresenting them was somewhat bluntly informed that parliament had done\r\nwhat it had judged fit in the matter of the City’s arrears; that it was\r\nmuch dissatisfied with the slowness with which they were being got in;\r\nthat the City was setting a very bad example to others which might have\r\nill consequences; that the commands of parliament were expected to be\r\nobeyed, and that prompt measures ought to be taken by the City to carry\r\nthem out.(833)\r\n\r\n(M413)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (24 Nov.) Fairfax wrote to the City from Windsor,(834)\r\nwhither the army had removed as soon as the king’s escape (11 Nov.) from\r\nHampton Court did away with the necessity of its presence in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of London, informing the authorities that as parliament had\r\nraised an objection to his sending troops to the city for the purpose of\r\ngetting in arrears, he was content to wait and see the result of\r\nparliamentary action in the matter and whether the City’s recent promises\r\nbore fruit or not. Should the result prove unsatisfactory, he doubted not\r\nthe consequences would be sad, \"and that not more to the parliament,\r\nkingdom or army than to the city itself.\"\r\n\r\n(M414)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st December Alderman Bide, who had narrowly escaped impeachment\r\nwith Gayer and the rest, and who was now sheriff, presented a petition to\r\nthe Commons on behalf of the City. This petition, which had been ordered\r\nto be prepared as far back as the 6th November—that is to say, before\r\nCharles’s escape from Hampton Court and the withdrawal of the army to\r\nWindsor—after expressing the City’s humble submission to parliament and\r\nits appreciation of the many benefits it had derived from the course which\r\nparliament had followed, prayed the House to take steps for the removal of\r\nthe army to a greater distance from the city and for the strict observance\r\nof the Covenant, and concluded by asking for the release of their Recorder\r\nand of the aldermen recently committed to prison.(835) The Journal of the\r\nHouse records nothing more than the formal answer which the Commons\r\nreturned to the petition: their thanks to the City for expressions of\r\ngoodwill, their readiness to consider such matters referred to in the\r\npetition as had not been already taken in hand, and their assurance that\r\nspeedy justice should be done to those imprisoned.(836) But from other\r\nsources it appears that the petition created considerable ill-feeling in\r\nthe House, and that it was only after Vane had threatened to bring the\r\narmy back again that the petition was practically rejected. Had the\r\npetitioners succeeded in their object it was expected that the\r\nPresbyterians in parliament and in the city would have followed up their\r\nvictory by restoring the expelled members and preparing for a personal\r\ntreaty with Charles without imposing upon him any test whatever.(837)\r\n\r\n(M415)\r\n\r\nIn the city the royalist cause was gaining ground every day. The merchant\r\nwas tired of the disquietude that had so long prevailed, condemning him to\r\nfrequent calls upon his purse whilst preventing him replenishing it by his\r\ncommercial pursuits. He was ready to support any party that would promise\r\nhim peace and quiet. \"The citty is subject still to be ridden by every\r\nparty and wilbe so rather than endanger trade and stock,\" wrote a royalist\r\nin March of this year.(838) The more youthful inhabitant was disgusted\r\nwith the closing of the playhouses,(839) whilst the shopkeeper was\r\nindignant at having to close his shop on Christmas-day for fear of a riot,\r\nnotwithstanding his having parliamentary sanction for opening it. The city\r\napprentices resisted the interference of the lord mayor and his officers\r\nwho would have put a stop to their decorating a pump in Cornhill with\r\nevergreens at Christmas, and not only did ministers who had been deprived\r\nfor malignancy occupy pulpits in various city churches on that day, but\r\nthey used the Book of Common Prayer.(840)\r\n\r\n(M416)\r\n\r\nThe mayor, who owed his election to pressure of parliament, and who was on\r\nthat account never really popular in the city, unwittingly assisted the\r\nroyal cause by another act of injudicious meddling. On Sunday, the 9th\r\nApril, 1648, he sent a detachment of trained bands to interfere with the\r\namusement of some boys playing tip-cat in Moorfields. A crowd of\r\napprentices and others took the part of the boys, and attacked the trained\r\nbands, getting possession of their arms and colours. With these they\r\nmarched, some three or four thousand strong, along Fleet Street and the\r\nStrand, raising the shout of \"Now for King Charles!\" and intending to make\r\ntheir way to Whitehall, but before they reached Charing Cross they were\r\nscattered by a troop of cavalry quartered at the King’s Mews, and for a\r\ntime the disturbance was at an end. During the night, however, the\r\napprentices again arose and made themselves masters of Ludgate and\r\nNewgate. Laying their hands on whatever ammunition they could find, and\r\nsummoning their friends by drums belonging to the trained bands, they\r\nproceeded to attack the mansion of the unpopular mayor. Whilst a messenger\r\nwas hurrying off to Fairfax for military aid, the mayor, the sheriffs and\r\nthe Committee of Militia had to repel as best they could the attacks of\r\nthe mob, who kept firing through the windows of the lord mayor’s house. At\r\nlast the troops arrived, and were admitted into the city by Aldersgate.\r\nThey followed up the rioters to the Leadenhall, where arms were being\r\ncollected. Resistance to a disciplined force soon proved useless. The\r\nringleaders were taken and led off to prison, and the crowd was dispersed,\r\nbut not without some little bloodshed.(841) The affair made the city\r\npoorer by the sum of £300, that amount being voted by the Court of\r\nAldermen out of the city’s cash to the officers and soldiers sent by\r\nFairfax to suppress the riot.(842)\r\n\r\n(M417)\r\n\r\nOn the 13th April the city authorities submitted to both Houses an account\r\nof what had recently taken place, which the Houses ordered to be printed.\r\nParliament accepted their assurance that they were in no way responsible\r\nfor the outbreak, and thanked the mayor and all others concerned for the\r\npart they had taken in its suppression. A day was appointed for a public\r\nthanksgiving for deliverance from the threatened danger. The Tower\r\ngarrison was augmented and the city’s chains removed, in view of a\r\nrecurrence of danger, whilst a commission of Oyer and Terminer was issued\r\nfor the punishment of those implicated in the late riot.(843)\r\n\r\n(M418) (M419)\r\n\r\nSix months and more had now passed since Gayer, the late deposed mayor,\r\nand his brother aldermen had been committed to prison, and no steps had as\r\nyet been taken to bring them to trial. At length articles of impeachment\r\nwere drawn up by the Commons and sent up to the Lords (15 April),(844)\r\ncharging him with having on the 26th July last past, in conjunction with\r\nThomas Adams, John Langham, James Bunce, aldermen of the city and others,\r\n\"maliciously and traitorously plotted and endeavoured with open force and\r\nviolence, and with armed power, to compel and enforce the Lords and\r\nCommons then assembled in parliament at Westminster to alter the laws and\r\nordinances by parliament established for the safety and weal of the realm;\r\nand likewise maliciously and traitorously raised and levied war against\r\nthe king, parliament and kingdom.\" Gayer took exception to the\r\njurisdiction of the House, and when brought before the Lords and ordered\r\nto kneel at the bar as a delinquent refused to do anything of the kind,\r\nfor which contempt he was fined £500. After hearing the articles of\r\nimpeachment read, he declared that he disavowed and abhorred the offences\r\nwith which he was charged, and asked to be furnished with a copy of them.\r\nHe further desired the assistance of counsel and time to answer them, both\r\nof which were allowed.(845) When his brother aldermen and fellow prisoners\r\nappeared before the Lords to hear their several charges read to them and\r\nwere ordered to kneel as delinquents, they too refused. Like Gayer they\r\nwere severally fined(846) and relegated to the Tower, whence they had been\r\nbrought. There the four aldermen remained prisoners until a crisis arrived\r\nin the following June, when the Commons, fearing to alienate the city at a\r\ntime when the enemy was almost at its gates, declared (3 June) that they\r\nwould proceed no further with the charges.(847) The Lords thereupon\r\nordered (6 June) their discharge and their impeachments to be\r\nvacated.(848)\r\n\r\n(M420)\r\n\r\nGayer did not live long to enjoy his liberty. By his will, dated the 19th\r\nDecember following his discharge, he left a sum of £200 for the purchase\r\nof lands or tenements the rents of which were to be devoted to the\r\npreaching of a sermon on the 16th October of every year in the church of\r\nSt. Catherine Cree in commemoration of the testator’s escape from a lion\r\nwhilst travelling in Africa. The sermon is preached to this day and is\r\ncommonly known as the \"Lion Sermon.\"(849)\r\n\r\n(M421)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile matters assumed a gloomy aspect for the Independents,\r\nculminating in the news that an army was in course of being raised in\r\nScotland. The object for which this step was being taken was declared to\r\nbe the establishment of the Presbyterian form of religion in England, the\r\nsuppression of heresy and the Book of Common Prayer, the disbandment of\r\nFairfax’s army of sectaries, and the opening of negotiations with Charles,\r\nwho was to be brought for the purpose to the neighbourhood of London.(850)\r\n\r\n(M422)\r\n\r\nMatters were made worse by the continued ill-feeling between the City and\r\nthe English army, whose pay was still largely in arrear. No threats of\r\nFairfax or of parliament had succeeded in making the inhabitants of the\r\ncity pay up their arrears of assessments, and unless these were paid the\r\nsoldiers had no alternative but to starve or render themselves obnoxious\r\nto the nation by living at free quarters. The City had been already\r\ncharged with withholding money for the express purpose of driving the army\r\nto the latter alternative, that so the nation might the quicker be free of\r\nit. The army was fast losing patience, and there was some talk of it\r\ntaking the law into its own hands.\r\n\r\n(M423) (M424)\r\n\r\nOn the 24th April the mayor informed the citizens assembled in Common\r\nCouncil that he had received information from one John Everard of certain\r\nmatters which the informer pretended to have overheard at Windsor greatly\r\naffecting the city. He had examined Everard on oath, and the result of the\r\nexamination being then openly read, it was resolved to lay the same before\r\nparliament.(851) Accordingly, on the 27th, Everard’s information, which\r\nwas nothing more nor less than a threat which he had overheard some\r\nofficers make of disarming and plundering the city, was laid before both\r\nHouses, together with a petition from the municipal authorities that the\r\nchains which had been recently removed from the streets of the city by\r\norder of parliament might be restored for the purpose of defence, that the\r\narmy should be removed to a greater distance, and that Skippon might be\r\nplaced in command of the city’s forces.(852) There was nothing to be\r\ngained by opposing the city’s wishes in the matter of replacing the chains\r\nand the appointment of Skippon, so that these concessions were readily\r\nmade, but the question of removing the army could only be decided with the\r\nconcurrence of the army itself.\r\n\r\n(M425)\r\n\r\nA member of the Common Council, Philip Chetwyn, was charged with having\r\npublicly declared that Skippon’s appointment was not the real wish of the\r\ncourt, and that \"seaven lies\" had been voted by the court on the 11th\r\nApril last.(853) Chetwyn gave an emphatic denial to the first charge, and\r\neventually both charges were allowed to drop. The council at the same time\r\npassed a resolution to the effect that whenever a charge should in future\r\nbe made by one member of the court against another, and the court take\r\ncognisance of it, the charge itself and the names of the accuser and the\r\naccused should be expressed in the order of the court.(854)\r\n\r\n(M426) (M427)\r\n\r\nThe City lost no time in availing itself of the assent of parliament to\r\nreplace the chains in the streets from which they had been removed. They\r\nwent further than this. From Saturday night to the following Monday night\r\n(28-30 May) the gates and posterns were ordered to be kept closed and\r\nguarded, the names of all lodgers were to be taken, vagrant soldiers were\r\nto be ordered to their quarters, whilst servants and children were to be\r\nconfined indoors, except on the Sunday that intervened, when they might be\r\nescorted to church by their parents or masters.(855) The reason for these\r\nprecautions was that there had been unmistakable signs of the army getting\r\nout of hand. An unexpected danger, the revolt of the whole of South Wales,\r\nwhich meant nothing less than the renewal of the war, served, however, to\r\nconsolidate the ranks.\r\n\r\n(M428)\r\n\r\nWith Wales up in arms for the king and the north of England threatened\r\nwith a Scottish invasion the army had enough to do without keeping a\r\nforcible hold on London. The City, therefore, had to be left to itself,\r\nand to be kept in good humour by concessions rather than by force until\r\nthe trouble had passed away. The story goes that before Cromwell proceeded\r\nto quell the rebellion in Wales the Council of War resolved that the City\r\nshould have all they asked or desired, \"there being no other way for the\r\npresent to quiet them.\" It would be time enough when the enemy had been\r\nbeaten to \"make the City pay for all.\"(856)\r\n\r\n(M429)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st May Fairfax wrote to the Commons from Windsor announcing his\r\nintention to despatch Cromwell into Wales and to withdraw the regiments\r\nquartered at Whitehall and Charing Cross, leaving the protection of\r\nparliament to the London forces under the command of Skippon. The same day\r\nthat the Commons received this letter (2 May) they communicated with the\r\nCommon Council of the city, who were delighted at the execution of their\r\nlong expressed wishes that the army should be removed from the vicinity of\r\nLondon and at the compliment paid them by Fairfax in placing the\r\nprotection of parliament in their hands. The sum of £600 a year was voted\r\nto Skippon for his services, a sum just double that allowed him on his\r\nappointment as sergeant-major-general in January, 1642.(857) Fairfax wrote\r\nhim a friendly letter complimenting him on his past services to parliament\r\nand the kingdom and expressing regret at parting from him. He at the same\r\ntime disengaged Skippon from all ties to himself and the army under his\r\ncommand, and wished him much happiness in his new sphere.(858)\r\n\r\n(M430)\r\n\r\nThe civic authorities were not slow to take advantage of the turn of\r\naffairs. If they were to be responsible for the protection of parliament\r\nand the peace of the city, surely, they reasoned, the appointment of their\r\nown Committee of Militia should be left in their hands as well as the\r\ncustody of the Tower. Both Houses accordingly were approached with\r\npetitions to this effect (9 May).(859) The Lords hesitated,(860) but the\r\nCommons at once acquiesced.(861) On the 16th the Commons had under\r\nconsideration the several names of persons chosen (12th May) by the Common\r\nCouncil to serve on the Militia Committee,(862) and agreed to the City’s\r\nnomination of Lieutenant-Colonel West to be lieutenant of the Tower.(863)\r\n\r\n(M431)\r\n\r\nOn the 19th a deputation of Lords and Commons waited on the Common Council\r\nand informed them that both Houses had assented to their wishes. In return\r\nfor this favour parliament expected that the City would secure them from\r\ntumult and insurrections, and \"did now put themselves really and truly\r\ninto the hands of the city.\" The court was at the same time assured that\r\nparliament meditated no alteration of the fundamental government of the\r\nkingdom by king, lords and commons, that it was resolved to stand by the\r\nsolemn league and covenant and preserve the treaties between England and\r\nScotland.(864)\r\n\r\n(M432) (M433)\r\n\r\nOnce more at an important crisis in England’s history all depended upon\r\nthe attitude of the city of London. \"The key of the situation was in the\r\nhands of the city, which had it in its power to paralyse the army by\r\nsimply maintaining an attitude of passive resistance.\"(865) But great as\r\nwas the detestation in which the army was held by the majority of\r\ncitizens, their distrust of the royalists, should they regain the upper\r\nhand, was greater. Under the circumstances the City resolved to maintain\r\nits attitude of standing by parliament, and gave its assurance to both\r\nHouses that it was ready \"to live and die with them according to the\r\nsolemn league and covenant.\"(866)\r\n\r\n(M434)\r\n\r\nFour days later (23 May) the City presented a petition to both Houses in\r\nwhich, after acknowledging the joy and comfort they had derived from the\r\nrecent announcement made to them that parliament was resolved to make no\r\nconstitutional change in the government of the kingdom by king, lords and\r\ncommons, and other matters conducive to peace, the citizens prayed that\r\nthe Houses would release their Recorder, the aldermen and the rest of the\r\ncitizens that were still imprisoned in the Tower. The Commons replied by\r\nat once ordering the release of Glyn and nine other prisoners, and\r\npromised to take into consideration the release of the aldermen, which was\r\na more serious business, in a week’s time.(867)\r\n\r\n(M435)\r\n\r\nParliament was the more anxious to conciliate the City inasmuch as a\r\nroyalist rising had already taken place in Kent (21 May). On the 26th May\r\na deputation from the Commons waited on the Common Council with a request\r\nfor an immediate advance of £6,000. A portion of the money was to be\r\ndevoted to the payment of Fairfax’s soldiers, \"to enable them to march\r\nout,\" and give place to the city’s own force under Colonel West. The money\r\nwas at once voted,(868) and Fairfax, after giving orders for securing\r\nSouthwark, proceeded to occupy Blackheath, the place appointed for the\r\nrendezvous of the insurgents.\r\n\r\n(M436)\r\n\r\nWhilst Fairfax was engaged in putting down the rising in Kent the royalist\r\nparty in the city was not inactive. On the 30th May a petition was\r\npresented to the Common Council, purporting to emanate from \"divers well\r\naffected citizens and other inhabitants\" of the city, desiring the court\r\nto approach parliament with the view (_inter alia_) of bringing about a\r\npersonal treaty with the king and appeasing the Kentish insurgents \"by way\r\nof accommodation and not by any engagement in blood.\"(869) Contrary to its\r\nusual practice the court consented to forward the petition to both Houses,\r\nwhich it did on the 1st June, with the result that a deputation from\r\nparliament waited on the court that same afternoon with a verbal reply.\r\nThe precise terms of the reply are not recorded. We are only told that\r\nafter a \"full and large declaration\" made by the parliamentary members,\r\nthe council expressed itself as completely satisfied.(870)\r\n\r\n(M437)\r\n\r\nAn appeal was made the same day (1 June) by a certain section of the\r\ninhabitants of the city for a Common Hall to be summoned. The appeal was\r\nmade to the Common Council. The court took time to consider the matter.\r\nAfter consulting the law-officers it was eventually agreed not to accede\r\nto the request, on the plea that, although it was in the power of the\r\ncourt to assemble the livery for the election of public officers and other\r\npurposes as might be necessary for the public good of the city, it was\r\nneither fit nor convenient to summon them at the present juncture on\r\naccount of the present distraction and distempers of the city and places\r\nadjacent.(871)\r\n\r\n(M438) (M439)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (3 June), when a deputation from parliament again appeared\r\nbefore the Common Council with the news that the insurgents were making\r\ntheir way to Blackheath under the leadership of the Earl of Norwich,\r\notherwise known as \"Lord Goring,\" and asked that the Militia Committee\r\nmight speedily raise what force it could for the protection of parliament\r\nand the city, the opportunity was again taken of pressing the Houses for\r\nthe release of the aldermen, an act which they were assured \"would give\r\ngood satisfaction to the city and very much quiet their minds.\"(872) That\r\nsame afternoon the Commons resolved to proceed no further with the\r\nimpeachments of the aldermen, and on the 6th they were set free by order\r\nof the House of Lords.(873)\r\n\r\n(M440)\r\n\r\nParliament could not well have done otherwise, unless they wished to lose\r\ntheir main support—the support of the City; for although the Earl of\r\nNorwich found the city’s gates shut against him, as was to be expected\r\nwith Warner occupying the mayoralty chair and Skippon in command of the\r\ntrained bands, there was, as we have seen, a considerable party in the\r\ncity who favoured the royalist cause and would gladly have trusted Charles\r\nif they dared.\r\n\r\n(M441)\r\n\r\nNor were the municipal authorities themselves adverse to the restoration\r\nof the king, but such restoration must be effected on their own terms.\r\nAgain and again they called upon parliament to open a personal treaty with\r\nCharles. On the 22nd June the Common Council directed a petition to both\r\nHouses to be drafted, thanking them for setting the aldermen at liberty,\r\nand praying them to allow the king to come to some house near parliament\r\nwhere negotiations might be carried on.(874) The petition was submitted to\r\nboth Houses on the 27th June, and was well received.(875) The Commons, in\r\nreply, declared that they were using their best endeavours in the interest\r\nof peace, and they had already appointed a committee to consider what\r\nfurther offers could be made to the king, as well as of \"time, place and\r\nother circumstances for convenience of address to be made to his\r\nmajesty.\"(876)\r\n\r\n(M442)\r\n\r\nA week later (5 July) the Common Council introduced to the House of Lords\r\nanother petition, in which the officers of the trained bands of the city\r\nmade a similar request for a personal treaty to be made with the king in\r\nLondon, and not only repeated a former request made by the City itself\r\nthat the London regiments might be associated with those of the adjacent\r\ncounties, but asked that the force thus formed might be furnished with a\r\ncontingent of cavalry. To all these requests the Lords gave a ready\r\nassent.(877) The Commons, however, to whom a similar petition was\r\npresented the same day, whilst signifying their assent to the amalgamation\r\nof the trained bands, left the other matters for further consideration,\r\nand appointed a committee to confer with the Common Council and the\r\nofficers of the trained bands the following afternoon.(878)\r\n\r\n(M443)\r\n\r\nThe question to be considered was the steps to be taken for the security\r\nof the king’s person in the event of his taking up his quarters in London\r\nfor the purpose of negotiating. The Common Council, for their part,\r\nundertook in such an event to venture their lives and fortunes in\r\ndefending his majesty against all violence according to the covenant, and\r\nappointed a committee to confer with the parliamentary committee and with\r\nthe military officers as to the best means of enabling them to carry out\r\nthis engagement.(879)\r\n\r\n(M444)\r\n\r\nBy the 11th July the committee was in a position to report to the Common\r\nCouncil the result of the conference so far as it had gone.(880) The\r\nparliamentary committee had propounded seven questions bearing upon the\r\nterms of the City’s engagement to protect the king against violence\r\npending negotiations, and its intentions as to the king’s person in the\r\nevent of such negotiations falling through. To these the city committee\r\nhad made replies (now submitted to the council for approval), and had\r\nadded certain propositions to the parliamentary committee to enable the\r\nCity the better to carry out its engagement. The first two of these\r\nrelated to the amalgamation and increase of the militia; the third asked\r\nthat, pending negotiations, no force should be allowed to come within\r\nthirty miles of London, and that riot and tumult raised in the city during\r\nthat period after proclamation made should be met with a death penalty;\r\nand the last that if parliament so willed no one who had ever taken up\r\narms against it should be allowed within thirty miles of London without\r\nleave. Both the answers and proposals of the city committee were alike\r\napproved by the council, and a house-to-house visitation was organised for\r\nthe purpose of getting names subscribed to the city’s engagement.\r\n\r\n(M445)\r\n\r\nThe demand for a death penalty on rioters in the city was not unwarranted.\r\nThere were not wanting signs of disaffection even in the ranks of the\r\ncity’s militia. So recently as Saturday, the 8th July, the Speaker\r\nhimself, whilst being escorted to his coach by a company of soldiers, had\r\nbeen insulted by one in the ranks, who cried out to the surrounding mob\r\n\"that now he was out of their charge they [the mob] should tear him in\r\npieces.\"(881) A few days later (12 July) some prisoners of war were\r\nrescued in the streets of London by the mob, and the lord mayor received a\r\nsharp reprimand for not keeping better order in the city.(882) The\r\nCommons, in consequence, resolved that no more prisoners should be brought\r\nto London.(883)\r\n\r\n(M446) (M447)\r\n\r\nIt was known that about this time secret enlistments were being carried on\r\nin the city, and that horses were being despatched out of the city by twos\r\nand threes to assist the royalists. It was also reported that an attempt\r\nwas about to be made to seize the Tower.(884) The majority of the\r\ninhabitants, nevertheless, remained faithful to parliament, and the\r\nSpeaker took the opportunity of a petition addressed to both Houses (12\r\nJuly) from \"divers well-affected magistrates, citizens, ministers and\r\nother inhabitants\" of the city and parts adjacent, praying them to enter\r\ninto no treaty without proper assurances for the maintenance of the\r\ncovenant,(885) to compliment the aldermen and great magistrates of the\r\ncity on their courage and fidelity. It was a petition—the Speaker said,\r\naddressing the deputation—for peace, and such peace as the House and all\r\nhonest men desired. It had come at a most seasonable time, when parliament\r\nwas the object of much abuse and men dared not own their true opinions.\r\nThe petition was the more valuable from the quality of the\r\npetitioners—\"divers aldermen and great magistrates of the city of London,\r\nmany reverend ministers, who have always held close to the cause, and\r\nothers, the gentlemen of birth and quality that have less valued their\r\nblood than the hazard and loss of so noble an undertaking.\" On behalf of\r\nthe Commons he returned them real and hearty thanks, assuring them that\r\nthe House approved of the petition and the matter thereof, and that in\r\nprosecuting the peace it would take care to preserve the religion, laws\r\nand liberties of all those who have been constant to these ends.(886)\r\n\r\n(M448)\r\n\r\nOn the 18th July the City caused two petitions to be presented to both\r\nHouses, one of which asked for an impost to be laid on Newcastle coals,\r\nand the other repeated the old request for an amalgamation of the city’s\r\nmilitia with that of the neighbouring counties. To the first no answer was\r\nvouchsafed. To the second the Commons replied that the matter had already\r\nbeen referred to a committee; whilst the Lords directed an ordinance to be\r\ndrawn up pursuant to the wishes of the petitioners. The petition relative\r\nto the militia was met by a counter-petition from \"divers well-affected\r\ncitizens of London and inhabitants in and about the same,\" the authors of\r\nwhich the Common Council wished to discover.(887)\r\n\r\n(M449)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime enlistments of horse and foot had been to such an extent\r\ncarried on clandestinely in the city, under pretext of the parliamentary\r\npowers granted to Skippon, that the municipal authorities began to get\r\nnervous. Servants and apprentices were reported to have enlisted one\r\nanother at all hours of the night, and to have issued spurious\r\ncommissions. Against the continuation of such proceedings, which\r\nthreatened the city with danger, the authorities petitioned both Houses\r\n(22 July). The Lords consented to revoke a commission granted to Skippon\r\nto raise a troop of cavalry for the protection of parliament,\r\nindependently of the Committee of Militia; the Commons, on the other hand,\r\ndetermined to let the order stand.(888) The civic authorities thereupon\r\nyielded to the entreaties of the inhabitants of the city, and resolved (27\r\nJuly) to raise a troop of horse on their own account to be subject to the\r\norders of the Militia Committee alone. On the 29th they again petitioned\r\nthe Commons.(889) That day being Saturday the House appointed a committee\r\nto confer with the Common Council on the following Monday afternoon, and\r\nundertook to put a stop to irregular enlistments in the future.(890)\r\n\r\n(M450)\r\n\r\nWhen Monday came a deputation from the Commons duly appeared and explained\r\nthe reasons for continuing Skippon’s commission and the measures that were\r\nto be taken to prevent irregular enlistments. Several letters were read\r\nfor the purpose of demonstrating the dangers with which the country was\r\nstill threatened, among them being one from a royalist agent in London, in\r\nwhich the writer informed his correspondent of the progress of the\r\nroyalist cause in the city. \"We are in this city,\" he declared, \"generally\r\nright; only Skippon makes some disturbance by listing horse and foot,\r\nwhich, though inconsiderable to what we have listed for us, yet we hope\r\nnot only to null his listing, but out him from his being general of this\r\ncity. The Lords have already done something, but wait for some further\r\nencouragement from hence, to which purpose the Common Council are about\r\nframing a petition.\"(891) The reading of this letter appears to have had a\r\ndiametrically opposite effect upon the members of the council than was\r\nanticipated, for they still insisted upon the withdrawal of Skippon’s\r\nauthority under which the irregular enlistments were carried on. The\r\nCommons, however, refused to be moved from their former resolution.\r\n\r\n(M451)\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd August a letter from the Prince of Wales, who had recently\r\narrived with a fleet off Yarmouth, was read to the Common Council. The\r\nletter had been forwarded to its destination by the company of merchant\r\nadventurers, and contained a copy of the prince’s declaration to the\r\neffect that he was approaching the shores of England to settle religion in\r\naccordance with the terms of the agreement between his father and the\r\nScots, to restore the king to his throne, and to bring about an act of\r\noblivion and the disbandment of all armies.(892) He had recently seized\r\nseveral merchantmen in the Downs—one alone being valued at £20,000—and he\r\nasked the Common Council to pay him that sum to assist him in his\r\nenterprise, promising on receipt of the money to set the vessels\r\nfree.(893)\r\n\r\n(M452)\r\n\r\nOn hearing this letter and declaration read the council forthwith\r\nappointed a committee to draw up a petition to parliament, in which they\r\nrepeated their request for a speedy personal treaty with the king so as to\r\nput an end to the present troubles and miseries. After sending for the\r\noriginal letter the Commons directed (3 Aug.) the City to make no reply to\r\nthe prince until the House took further order, and the next day declared\r\nall who aided the prince, by sea or by land, to be traitors and\r\nrebels.(894)\r\n\r\n(M453)\r\n\r\nDisappointed at the way in which the news of the arrival of his fleet had\r\nbeen received by the City, the prince lent a more ready ear to proposals\r\nfrom Scotland, and on the 16th August declared his acceptance of the terms\r\noffered. It was still believed by many that as soon as he should raise his\r\nstandard in the north the Presbyterians in the city would openly avow\r\nthemselves in his favour, and rumour had gone so far as to name the\r\ncommanders of their forces. \"The lords and the city,\" wrote one of\r\nRupert’s correspondents, \"understand each other, as also the reformadoes,\r\nthat are considerable—8,000 in number.\"(895)\r\n\r\n(M454)\r\n\r\nOn the 29th August the City was asked by a committee of the House of\r\nCommons to send money, corn or biscuit to the value of £20,000 for the\r\nrelief of the army in the north, and to take active measures for getting\r\nin all arrears of assessments due for the army of Fairfax.(896) But\r\nalthough the City so far acceded to this request as to take immediate\r\nsteps for getting in arrears of assessments, recent events—and notably the\r\nsuccesses of Cromwell and Fairfax at Preston and Colchester, as well as\r\nthe seizure of London ships and interference with London trade—had\r\nrendered the citizens anxious that parliament should come to an\r\nunderstanding with the army.(897)\r\n\r\n(M455)\r\n\r\nOn the 4th September a deputation from parliament appeared before the\r\nCommon Council and asked for a loan of £10,000, to be paid by weekly\r\ninstalments of £2,000, to enable the House to proceed with negotiations\r\nwith the king. The nature of the security to be given for the loan was\r\npractically left in the hands of the city provided it lay within the power\r\nof parliament. The request was unanimously granted, bonds under the city’s\r\nseal being offered as security to those willing to make advances.(898)\r\n\r\n(M456)\r\n\r\nThe prospect of negotiations being opened at all with the king was\r\ndistasteful to the radical party or \"Levellers\" in the city, and a\r\npetition was laid before the Commons on the 11th September calling upon\r\nthem as the supreme authority in the realm to shake off all control\r\nexercised over them by the House of Lords, and to render kings, queens,\r\nnobles and all persons alike subject to the law of the land. The\r\npetitioners finally asked the House to consider seriously \"whether the\r\njustice of God be likely to be satisfied or His yet continuing wrath\r\nappeased by an Act of Oblivion.\"(899)\r\n\r\n(M457)\r\n\r\nThis petition had little effect upon the House, and preparations were\r\nrapidly pushed forward. Fifteen commissioners were appointed, of whom\r\nGlyn, the Recorder, was one,(900) to go to Newport in the Isle of Wight\r\nfor the purpose of opening negotiations with Charles, who was allowed to\r\ntake up his quarters in that little town on parole. The commission held\r\nits first sitting on the 18th September, it being understood that\r\nnegotiations were to continue for forty days and no more. They, however,\r\ncontinued to be carried on long after the allotted time.\r\n\r\n(M458)\r\n\r\nEarly in November parliament was again pressed for money and was forced to\r\napply to the City for a further loan of £4,000 to enable it to proceed\r\nwith the \"Treaty.\" It at the same time complained of the inadequate guard\r\nprovided by the City for the protection of the Houses. The guard, it was\r\nsaid, consisted of hired men, and not citizens, who often quitted their\r\nposts when on duty. The subject led to an acrimonious debate in the Common\r\nCouncil. As soon as Alderman Gibbs, who was a member of the Militia\r\nCommittee, began to suggest a remedy for the evil, he was interrupted by\r\nPhilip Chetwyn, whose plain speaking had once before created trouble, and\r\nwho now boldly charged the alderman and others with telling \"many long\r\nstories to put the city in fear without cause.\" He declared that at a\r\nformer council the alderman had acted in a similar way, \"pretending that\r\nthe city was in great danger of having their throats cut whereas there was\r\nno such cause.\" This speech brought other members of the council on their\r\nlegs in defence of the alderman, who declared that this was not the first\r\ntime that Chetwyn had done him wrong, and asked the court to right him.\r\nWhat he had said at a former council about the danger the city was in was\r\nnothing more than what the Militia Committee had authorised him to say,\r\nand this statement was corroborated by other members of the committee then\r\npresent. Certain questions were thereupon put to the vote, when it was\r\ndecided (1) that Chetwyn had done the alderman a wrong by his speech, (2)\r\nthat what the alderman had spoken at a former council was warranted by the\r\nMilitia Committee, and (3) that the action by the committee on that\r\noccasion had been for the safety of the city, which was then in\r\ndanger.(901) On the 27th November the Militia Committee reported to the\r\ncouncil the steps taken to satisfy parliament that better protection would\r\nbe afforded to the Houses in the future.(902)\r\n\r\n(M459)\r\n\r\nBefore the end of November the army, now at Windsor, had entirely lost\r\npatience both with king and parliament, and on the last day of the month\r\nissued a declaration to the effect that it was about to appeal \"unto the\r\nextraordinary judgment of God and good people.\" The existing parliament\r\nmust be dissolved to give place to a succession of reformed parliaments.\r\nThose members who agreed with the army were invited to leave the House and\r\njoin the army to form a kind of provisional government until elections for\r\na new parliament could take place, when the army would willingly disband.\r\n\r\n(M460)\r\n\r\nThat same night (30 Nov.) whilst the mayor was going the rounds inspecting\r\nthe city watches a letter was put into his hands by a trumpeter of\r\nFairfax, addressed to the lord mayor, aldermen and common council.(903)\r\nStrictly speaking, the mayor had no right to open a letter thus addressed.\r\nReynardson, however, who had not long been in the mayoralty chair, and who\r\nafterwards displayed strong royalist proclivities, thought otherwise and\r\nbroke the seal; a proceeding which received the approval of the Common\r\nCouncil specially summoned for the next day (1 Dec.)(904) The letter\r\nannounced the general’s intention of quartering his army on London, and\r\ndemanded a sum of £40,000 out of the arrears of assessment to be paid to\r\nthe soldiers by the following night.(905)\r\n\r\n(M461)\r\n\r\nThe council at once decided to lay the letter before both Houses, and in\r\nthe meantime took steps for the immediate payment of an instalment of\r\n£10,000 to Fairfax, to whom a deputation was despatched to assure him that\r\nthe City would do its utmost to execute his commands.(906) Both Houses\r\nassented to Fairfax being provided with the money demanded, the Commons\r\ngiving the City liberty to communicate direct with the general by\r\ncommittee or letter as they should think fit.(907)\r\n\r\n(M462)\r\n\r\nIn spite of a request by the Commons that he would keep at a distance,\r\nlest his approach should involve danger, Fairfax entered London with his\r\ntroops on Saturday, the 2nd December, and took up his quarters at\r\nWhitehall. On Wednesday, the 6th—the day on which Colonel Pride\r\nadministered his famous \"purge\" to the House of Commons—a letter from the\r\ngeneral was read in the Common Council in which he desired that 3,800 beds\r\nmight be sent to Whitehall by ten o’clock the next morning for the use of\r\nthe soldiers, and also sufficient furniture for lodging. The beds and\r\nfurniture were to be afterwards returned.(908)\r\n\r\n(M463)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council immediately nominated a committee to go to Fairfax and\r\nto beg him to excuse the City furnishing the beds as desired. The\r\ncommittee was further instructed to inform his lordship that if he would\r\nobtain a warrant from the Committee of the Army to the Treasurers at War\r\nfor the payment of £10,000, the City would be prepared to pay over the\r\nwhole sum of £40,000 (which ought to have been already paid over) by the\r\nnext day (7 Dec). There was one other matter. A rumour had reached the\r\ncity that it was intended to arrest Major-General Browne, who at the time\r\nwas serving as one of the sheriffs of London, and the committee were\r\ndirected to point out to his excellency the \"inconveniences\" likely to\r\narise from such a proceeding.(909)\r\n\r\n(M464)\r\n\r\nFairfax paid little regard to what might or might not be convenient for\r\nthe City, and on the 12th Browne was arrested, together with Waller,\r\nMassey and others, on the charge of having joined in an invitation to the\r\nScots to invade England, although it was difficult to find evidence\r\nagainst them. The Court of Aldermen immediately interested themselves in\r\nendeavouring to obtain Browne’s release, guaranteeing to Fairfax, if he\r\nwould set the sheriff free, to produce him whenever required, and vouching\r\nfor his \"civil and quiet deportment\" in the city.(910)\r\n\r\n(M465)\r\n\r\nFinding that the money (£40,000) which he had ordered the City to furnish\r\nwas not forthcoming on the day appointed, Fairfax notified the Common\r\nCouncil by letter (8 Dec.) that he had given orders for seizing the\r\ntreasury at Goldsmiths’ Hall and Weavers’ Hall. The sum of £27,400 was\r\naccordingly seized at the latter Hall; and this sum Fairfax intended to\r\nkeep until the £40,000 should be paid. When that was done he would\r\nwithdraw his troops, and not before. On learning this the Common Council\r\nsent a deputation to inform his excellency that, if certain concessions\r\nwere made, the City itself would be responsible for repayment of the money\r\nseized, and that arrears should be got in as speedily as possible. At the\r\nsame time Fairfax was asked to withdraw his troops from the city.(911)\r\n\r\n(M466)\r\n\r\nTo these proposals Fairfax replied by letter the same day,(912) that if\r\nthe City would cause all the money charged on the City for the army up to\r\nthe 25th March next ensuing, and still in arrear, to be brought in within\r\nfourteen days, he would repay the money taken from Weavers’ Hall and would\r\nwithdraw his troops. Their presence in the city he affected to conceive\r\nwould facilitate the collection of the money. On the receipt of this\r\nletter the civic authorities renewed their exertions to hasten the getting\r\nin of assessments.(913)\r\n\r\n(M467)\r\n\r\nIt was thought that a saving might be effected by the discontinuance of\r\nthe trained bands in their duty of guarding the city. They were known to\r\nbe very remiss in their duties, piling their arms and leaving them in\r\ncharge of some few of their number whilst the others went away and amused\r\nthemselves. They had thus become a laughing-stock to the better\r\ndisciplined soldiers of the army, and brought discredit on the city. The\r\nquestion was eventually left to the discretion of the Militia Committee to\r\ncontinue the guards or not as it might think fit.(914)\r\n\r\n(M468)\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of every effort the money demanded by Fairfax was not\r\nforthcoming, and the maintenance of his troops quartered in the city\r\nbecame an intolerable burden. On Saturday, the 6th January, 1649, a\r\nfortnight’s pay, or, £19,000, was due to the soldiers, and unless the\r\nmoney was found within four days Fairfax threatened to quarter his whole\r\narmy upon the city. A house-to-house visitation for getting in arrears was\r\norganised. A short extension of time for payment to the army was asked for\r\nand obtained. Ministers were charged to exhort their parishioners on the\r\nintervening Sunday to pay up their arrears. The money was eventually\r\nadvanced by the Treasurers at War on the personal security of the aldermen\r\nand wealthier inhabitants of each ward.(915)\r\n\r\n(M469)\r\n\r\nThe feeling of detestation for the army and of inclination towards the\r\nking had in the meanwhile been growing stronger in the city day by day. A\r\nroyalist lord mayor, in the person of Abraham Reynardson, had recently\r\nbeen elected, and it was feared by parliament—or the Rump, as it came to\r\nbe called—that the same royalist proclivities would show themselves in the\r\nelections to the Common Council which were to take place on St. Thomas’s\r\nday (21 Dec.). An ordinance was accordingly passed on the 18th against the\r\nelection of \"malignants\" to the city council. This ordinance was amended\r\ntwo days later (20 Dec.) in such a way as to exclude every citizen who had\r\nsubscribed to an engagement for a personal treaty with the king.(916) It\r\nwas in vain that representation was made to parliament of the difficulty\r\nof getting a council together under such a restriction. The House was\r\ninflexible and ordered the election to be at once proceeded with. The\r\nelection accordingly took place, but when the members came to take their\r\nseats the mayor forbade them unless they were prepared to take the oath of\r\nallegiance, which had not yet been abolished. This action on the part of\r\nReynardson being reported to the House, it directed him (5 Jan., 1649) to\r\nforthwith summon the Common Council together, but to suspend the taking of\r\noaths until further order.(917) It at the same time gave orders for the\r\ncity chains to be removed and stored in the Leadenhall, the easier to put\r\ndown any disturbance that might arise in consequence of the recent\r\nelections.(918) The effect of the \"purge\" thus administered to the city’s\r\nparliament was soon to be seen.\r\n\r\n(M470)\r\n\r\nOn the 13th January, by which day a High Court of Justice had been\r\nespecially established for the king’s trial and all royalists had been\r\nbanished the city by order of Fairfax,(919) the new Common Council began\r\nto assert itself. The court had been summoned to meet at eight o’clock in\r\nthe morning (not an unusually early hour in those days), but the mayor did\r\nnot put in an appearance until eleven, and then was only accompanied by\r\ntwo aldermen, the number necessary to form a court. It was soon seen that\r\nthere was something wrong. The mayor refused to acknowledge the authority\r\nof the council or to allow the minutes of the last court to be read in\r\naccordance with custom. The council took but little notice of this and\r\npassed on to the next business. This was a petition to the House of\r\nCommons, drawn up and approved by a committee,(920) asking the House to\r\nexecute justice impartially and vigorously \"upon all the grand and capital\r\nauthors, contrivers of and actors in the late wars against parliament and\r\nkingdom, from the highest to the lowest,\" and to take steps, as the\r\nsupreme power of the nation, for the preservation of peace and the\r\nrecovery of trade and credit.(921) Such a petition was so diametrically\r\nopposed to the sentiments of the royalist lord mayor and his brother\r\naldermen that they got up and left the court rather than allow the\r\npetition to be sanctioned by their presence. Strictly speaking there was\r\nno longer any court. Nevertheless an attempt was made to get the Common\r\nSergeant and then the Town Clerk(922) to put the question, but they\r\nrefused to do so in the absence of the mayor and aldermen, and they too\r\ngot up and left the council chamber. Thus left to themselves the members\r\nof the court voted Colonel Owen Rowe into the chair. The petition was then\r\nthree times read, and after due deliberation unanimously agreed to, twenty\r\nmembers of the council being nominated to carry it up to the House,\r\ntogether with a narrative of the proceedings that had taken place that day\r\nin court.(923)\r\n\r\n(M471)\r\n\r\nIn submitting the petition to the Commons on the 15th January, Colonel\r\nRobert Tichborne, a member of the council, explained the reason why the\r\npetition varied in title from other petitions from the city, purporting,\r\nas it did, to come from the commons of the city alone, and not from the\r\nmayor, aldermen and commons, and with the petition presented a narrative\r\nof the proceedings that had taken place in the council two days\r\nbefore.(924) The House readily accepted the explanation (as was only to be\r\nexpected), and declared that the petition and narrative might and should\r\nof right be entered on the records of the Common Council. \"As to the\r\nCommon Council of the city of London, and so owned by this House\"—the\r\nSpeaker went on to say—\"they take notice of the extraordinary affections\r\nlong since and often expressed by many particular persons, if not by every\r\nmember of your present body, especially of that true and publick principle\r\nwhich carried you on to the framing of this petition, and to your going\r\nthrough with it, notwithstanding the opposition and withdrawing of your\r\nmayor and aldermen.\" The Speaker assured the deputation that the House\r\nfully approved of the members continuing to sit as a Common Council in the\r\nabsence or dissent of the mayor or aldermen, or both together, and\r\nconcluded by saying that both the petition and narrative would receive\r\nspeedy consideration.(925)\r\n\r\n(M472)\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd January two officers from the army waited upon the Court of\r\nAldermen and informed the members that the sum of £4,000 out of the\r\n£19,000 formerly demanded for the army was still in arrear. The money was\r\nin the hands of the Treasurers at War, but they refused to pay it over\r\nuntil they had received their security from the wards according to\r\nagreement. Fairfax pressed for an immediate payment, otherwise he would be\r\nunder the necessity of quartering troops of horse and foot upon those\r\nwards which had failed to give the promised security for arrears of\r\nassessments. Rather than this should happen the aldermen themselves\r\nengaged to be security to the treasurers for payment of the money.(926)\r\n\r\n(M473)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the special tribunal established for the trial of the\r\nking had commenced its work. At its head sat John Bradshaw, a\r\nsergeant-at-law and sometime a judge of the sheriffs’ court of the Wood\r\nStreet compter in the city.(927) Five aldermen were placed on the\r\ncommission, viz., Isaac Pennington, Thomas Andrews, Thomas Atkins, Rowland\r\nWilson and John Fowke;(928) but only the first two named took any active\r\npart in the trial, and Wilson absolutely declined to serve. Not one of\r\nthem affixed his signature to the king’s death-warrant. Among the rest of\r\nthe commissioners were, however, two citizens of repute, viz., Robert\r\nTichborne, afterwards an alderman,(929) and Owen Rowe, both of whom took\r\nan active part in the trial and both signed the warrant for the king’s\r\nexecution. When put upon his trial in October, 1660, for the part he now\r\ntook, Tichborne pleaded that what he had done was through ignorance, and\r\nthat had he known more he would sooner have entered a \"red hot oven\" than\r\nthe room in which the warrant was signed.(930) His penitence saved his\r\nlife, and he, like Pennington, spent the remainder of his days in\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the trial were unreasonably short and sharp. On Friday,\r\nthe 19th January, Charles was brought from Windsor to London. On the\r\nfollowing day he made his first appearance before his judges. On that day\r\nweek—Saturday, the 27th—sentence was pronounced, and three days later (30\r\nJan.) it was carried out before the king’s own banquetting-house at\r\nWhitehall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M474)\r\n\r\nWithin a week of the king’s execution the Commons, confident in their own\r\nstrength and that of the army, voted the abolition of king and house of\r\nlords, and declared England to be a Commonwealth.(931) They next proceeded\r\n(14 Feb.) to place the executive power in the hands of a Council of State\r\nof forty-one members, most of whom were also members of their own body,\r\nwith Bradshaw as president. Cromwell, Fairfax and Skippon were members of\r\nthe council, as also were two aldermen of the city, viz., Pennington and\r\nWilson.(932) The post of Secretary for Foreign Languages was offered to a\r\nkinsman of Bradshaw, and one of whom the city of London is justly proud,\r\nto wit, John Milton.\r\n\r\n(M475)\r\n\r\nThe revolution which was taking place in the government of the kingdom\r\nfound its counterpart in the municipal government of the City, where the\r\nmayor, aldermen and commons bore close analogy to the king, lords and\r\ncommons of the realm. The City was but the kingdom in miniature, the\r\nkingdom was but the City writ large. No sooner was the house of lords\r\nabolished, and with it the right of the lords to veto the Acts of the\r\ncommons, than the Court of Aldermen was deprived of a similar right over\r\nthe proceedings of the Common Council.\r\n\r\n(M476)\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1645 the right of the mayor and aldermen to veto an\r\nordinance made by the commons in Common Council assembled appears never to\r\nhave been disputed, but on the 24th January of that year, when fresh\r\nby-laws were under the consideration of the court, and the mayor and\r\naldermen claimed this privilege as a matter of right, objection was\r\nraised, and the question was referred to a committee.(933) No settlement\r\nof the matter appears to have been arrived at until matters were brought\r\nto a crisis by the action of the mayor and aldermen on the 13th January,\r\n1649, when, as we saw at the close of the last chapter, they got up and\r\nleft the court.\r\n\r\n(M477)\r\n\r\nIn view of similar action being taken by the mayor and aldermen in future,\r\nit was enacted by parliament (28 Feb.),(934) that all things proposed in\r\nCommon Council should thenceforth be fairly debated and determined in and\r\nby the same council as the major part of the members present should desire\r\nor think fit; \"and that in every vote which shall passe and in the other\r\nproceedings of the said councell neither the lord maior nor aldermen,\r\njoynte or separate, shall have any negative or distinctive voice or vote\r\notherwise than with and amonge and as parte of the rest of the members of\r\nthe said councell, and in the same manner as the other members have; and\r\nthat the absence or withdraweinge of the lord maior or aldermen from the\r\nsaid councell shall not stopp or prejudice the proceedings of the said\r\ncouncell; and that every Common Councell which shall be held in the city\r\nof London shall sitt and continue soe longe as the major parte of the\r\nsaide councell shall thinke fitte, and shall not be dissolved or adjourned\r\nbut by and accordinge to the order or consent of the major parte of the\r\nsame councell.\" It was further enacted that \"in all times to come the lord\r\nmaior ... soe often and att such time as any tenn or more of the Common\r\nCouncell men doe by wryting under theire hands request or desire him\r\nthereunto, shall summon, assemble and hold a Common Councell. And if at\r\nany tyme beinge soe requested or desired hee shall faile therein, then the\r\ntenn persons or more makeinge such request or desire shall have power, and\r\nare hereby authorized, by wrytinge under theire hands, to summon or cause\r\nto be summoned to the said councell the members belonginge thereunto in as\r\nample manner as the lord maior himself usually heretofore hath done.\"\r\n\r\n(M478)\r\n\r\nPursuant to this enactment the mayor received a written request from\r\nfifteen members of the council for a court to meet at three o’clock of the\r\nafternoon of the 14th June, 1650. The court assembled, but neither mayor\r\nnor any alderman appeared until a message was sent to the Court of\r\nAldermen then sitting requesting their attendance in the Common\r\nCouncil.(935) After prayers(936) his lordship declared that he had not\r\nsummoned the court inasmuch as the members who came to him on the matter\r\nhad refused to acquaint him with the reasons for which it was to be\r\nsummoned, and he moved that the subscribers to the request for a court\r\nshould state why the court was summoned before any other business was\r\ntaken in hand. This proposal met with great opposition, and a debate arose\r\non the question whether the mayor’s motion should take precedence of the\r\nreading of the minutes of the last court or not, and lasted until nine\r\no’clock at night. At length the mayor’s motion was negatived and the\r\nminutes of the last court were read. It then became known that the reason\r\nfor the court being summoned was to hear a committee’s report read. But\r\nthe mayor at this point declared himself tired with sitting so long and\r\nrose to go, promising to call a court the next morning or any time most\r\nconvenient. Upon certain members insisting upon the report being read then\r\nand there, his lordship and all the aldermen except one left the court.\r\nNevertheless the report was read, and the members themselves fixed a day\r\nfor another court for taking it into consideration unless the mayor\r\nhimself should summon one in the meantime. His lordship was informed of\r\nthis resolution by a deputation sent for the purpose.(937)\r\n\r\n(M479)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Common Council had resolved to administer to itself a\r\nfurther purge. A committee was appointed (17 March, 1649) to \"consider\r\nwhat officers are properly to sitt in this courte as itt is a courte, and\r\nby what authority they doe sitt there, and are to doe and performe service\r\nin the courte, and what sallary or allowance they shall conceive expedient\r\nto bee made to them respectively, and whether those officers shall bee\r\nyearely chosen or to remain for soe long time as they shall well and\r\nhonestly use and behave themselves in their places.\"(938) Another\r\ncommittee was appointed to enquire what members of the council or others\r\nholding positions under the council had subscribed engagements which\r\nbrought them within the purview of the ordinances of parliament of the\r\n18th and 20th December. It was further instructed to devise some good\r\nexpedient \"to heale upp all breaches and that may tende to union and to\r\nthe peace and safety of this citty, and likewise for the begettinge of a\r\nright understandinge and to keepe a good correspondency both betweene the\r\nparliament and citty and betweene the army and this citty.\"(939) Three\r\ndays later (20 March) the Common Council resolved that in the opinion of\r\nthe court \"such persons as were chosen to any places of trust within the\r\ncity (before the two ordinances of the xviijth and xxth of December last\r\nwere made) and doe continue in those places and are within the compasse of\r\nany the matters menconed in this same ordinances or either of them are as\r\nequally dangerous to be in any of those places as they that were forbidden\r\nto be chosen to any such place since the said ordinances made,\" and the\r\ncommittee last mentioned were to see how best to avert the danger.(940)\r\n\r\n(M480)\r\n\r\nWhen it came to proclaiming in the city the decrees of parliament\r\nabolishing the kingly office and the House of Lords, Reynardson, the\r\nmayor, declined to do so, and defended his action before the House by the\r\nplea of conscientious scruples. He was forthwith deposed from the\r\nmayoralty, condemned to pay a fine of £2,000 and committed to the\r\nTower.(941) As to the fine, he stoutly refused to pay it. His goods were\r\ntherefore seized and, according to the custom that prevailed, sold \"by the\r\ncandle.\"(942)\r\n\r\n(M481)\r\n\r\nNot content with deposing him from the mayoralty, the House deposed (7\r\nApril) Reynardson also from his aldermanry and with him four other\r\naldermen,(943) viz., John Gayer, Thomas Adams, John Langham and James\r\nBunce—the same who had undergone impeachment in 1648. Bunce was a special\r\nobject of aversion to the Council of State, who later on (14 April, 1651)\r\nordered an Act to be prepared declaring all who had correspondence with\r\nthe enemies of the Commonwealth, \"and especially with James Bunce, late\r\nalderman of London,\" guilty of high treason.(944)\r\n\r\n(M482)\r\n\r\nThe times were so much \"out of joint\" that it was no easy matter to find\r\nwell-to-do citizens willing to undertake an office which had become so\r\nunenviable, and many paid fines varying in amount from £400 to £1,000\r\nrather than serve.(945) By paying a fine for not taking upon himself the\r\nduties of an alderman a man could generally, upon petition, be relieved\r\nfrom serving as sheriff.(946)\r\n\r\n(M483)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the continued presence of the soldiers of Fairfax in the city\r\nwas becoming more and more burdensome. Scarcely a day passed without some\r\ndisturbance arising between the soldiers and the civil guardians of the\r\npeace. Occasionally there was bloodshed, and twice within a very few days\r\nappeal had to be made to the general himself to restrain the plundering\r\nand roystering habits of his men.(947) It is not surprising if, bearing in\r\nmind the horrors that the military occupation of the city had recently\r\nbrought upon the inhabitants, the Common Council rejected a proposal (17\r\nApril) that the custody of the Tower should be placed in the hands of a\r\nnational guard in preference to the city’s own trained bands.(948)\r\n\r\n(M484)\r\n\r\nA series of royalist successes in Ireland now engaged the attention of\r\nCromwell, recently appointed (15 March) lord-lieutenant of that country,\r\nbut nothing could be done without money. More than a year ago (16 Feb.,\r\n1648) an ordinance had been passed for raising money for Ireland, but in\r\nthe city it had been almost treated as a dead letter—\"in divers wards no\r\nassessment at all, and in most very little paid in.\" The civic authorities\r\nhad recently (22 March, 1649) been reminded of their remissness in this\r\nrespect by a letter from the Council of State, who threatened to enforce\r\ntheir ordinance if the City could not be brought to execute it from a\r\nsense of duty.(949)\r\n\r\n(M485)\r\n\r\nThree weeks later (12 April) a deputation from parliament, including\r\nCromwell himself, appeared before the Common Council and desired a loan of\r\n£120,000 upon the security of the Act for assessment of £90,000 per month\r\nand the Act for sale of fee-farm rents. The security was not liked,\r\nnevertheless the council nominated a committee to confer with parliament\r\nas to the best means of raising the money.(950)\r\n\r\n(M486)\r\n\r\nWant of money was not the only difficulty that Cromwell had to contend\r\nwith. The levelling spirit which two years before had displayed itself in\r\nthe ranks of the army, and had ever since been fostered by speeches and\r\nwritings of the wrong-headed and impracticable John Lilburne, again\r\nasserted itself. The troops refused to serve in Ireland. A mutiny broke\r\nout at \"The Bull,\" in Bishopsgate Street, the soldiers refusing to obey\r\ntheir colonel’s orders and seizing the regimental colours. An example had\r\nto be made, so one of the ringleaders was shot in St. Paul’s Churchyard.\r\nFive others condemned to death were pardoned. The funeral of the\r\nunfortunate man who was executed was made the occasion of a public\r\ndemonstration against parliament and the army,(951) and for some time\r\nafterwards the Levellers continued to give trouble in different parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n(M487)\r\n\r\nTime was passing rapidly and yet the establishment of the Commonwealth\r\nstill remained unproclaimed in the city. On the 10th May Colonel Venn, one\r\nof the city members, was ordered to enquire and report to the House as to\r\nthe cause of the delay.(952) At length, on the 30th May, the formal\r\nproclamation was made by Andrews, the new mayor, assisted by twelve of his\r\nbrother aldermen(953) and by a _posse_ of troops which had to be sent for\r\nto preserve order. \"It was desired,\" wrote the secretary of the French\r\nambassador in England to Cardinal Mazarin, \"that this act should be\r\neffected in the ordinary form of a simple publication, without the mayor\r\nand aldermen being supported by any soldiers, in order to show that no\r\nviolent means had been resorted to; but a crowd of people having gathered\r\naround them with hootings and insults, compelled them to send for some\r\ntroops, who first drove away all bystanders, and thus they finished their\r\npublication.\"(954) A man named Prior was arrested for attempted riot and\r\nwas sent by the mayor to the Council of State, by whom he was committed to\r\nthe gatehouse.(955)\r\n\r\n(M488)\r\n\r\nTwo aldermen, Sir Thomas Soame and Richard Chambers, who had absented\r\nthemselves on the occasion, were called before the bar of the House (1\r\nJune) to answer for their conduct. Soame, who was himself a member of the\r\nHouse, boldly declared that the proclamation \"was against several oaths\r\nwhich he had taken as an alderman of London, and against his judgment and\r\nconscience.\" Chambers said in defence \"that his heart did not go along in\r\nthat business.\" Both delinquents were adjudged to lose their aldermanries,\r\nand Soame was also condemned to lose his seat in the House.(956) Whilst\r\ninflicting punishment upon those who determined to remain staunch to the\r\nroyalist cause, the House resolved to honour those who supported the new\r\norder of things, and on the 6th June a proposal was made to authorise the\r\nSpeaker \"to create the dignity of a knight, and to confer the same upon\r\nThomas Andrews, alderman and lord mayor of London, and Isaac Pennington\r\nand Thomas Atkins [Atkin], aldermen and formerly lord mayors.\"(957)\r\n\r\n(M489)\r\n\r\nThursday, the 7th June, having been appointed a day of public thanksgiving\r\nfor the suppression of the Levellers, the Common Council resolved (29 May)\r\nto invite the Commons of England, the Council of State and other high\r\nofficers, as well as Fairfax and the chief officers of the army, to a\r\ndinner at Grocers’ Hall, in order to \"manifest the city’s good affections\r\ntowards them.\" The House accepted the invitation and appointed\r\nChristchurch, Newgate, to be the church wherein the thanksgiving service\r\nwas to take place.(958) The same deference and respect was paid on this\r\noccasion to the Speaker as was customarily paid to the king, the mayor\r\ndelivering the civic sword into his hands on entering the city and\r\nreceiving it back again, whilst the chief seat at the banquet was also\r\nsurrendered to him.(959)\r\n\r\n(M490)\r\n\r\nThe City showed exceptional honour to Fairfax and to Cromwell, presenting\r\nthe former with a bason and ewer of gold weighing 242 ozs. 14 dwts., and\r\nthe latter with another bason and ewer, as well as with two flower pots, a\r\nperfume and chafing dish, two fruit baskets, a kettle and laver and a\r\nwarming pan, the whole weighing 934 ozs. 9 dwts. Cromwell was also\r\npresented with a purse containing £200 in twenty-shilling pieces.(960)\r\nThomas Vyner, a goldsmith of repute, who was sheriff at the time, provided\r\nthe plate at a cost of £1,412 15s.(961)\r\n\r\n(M491)\r\n\r\nThe House was so pleased with the flattering reception it had received\r\nthat the next day (8 June) it appointed a special committee \"to consider\r\nof some mark of favour and respect\" to be done to the City,(962) and on\r\nthe 30th it resolved \"that the city of London have the New Park in the\r\ncounty of Surrey settled upon them and their successors, as an act of\r\nfavour from this House, for the use of the city and their successors, and\r\nthat an Act be brought in for the purpose.\"(963) Accordingly, on the 17th\r\nJuly, an Act \"for settling the New Park of Richmond, alias Richmond Great\r\nPark, on the mayor and commonalty and citizens of London and their\r\nsuccessors\" was brought in and passed.(964)\r\n\r\n(M492)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (5 July) Cromwell had again appeared before the Common\r\nCouncil and had desired a further advance of £150,000 upon the security of\r\nthe excise. The matter was referred to a committee.(965) By the 13th\r\nAugust the new lord-lieutenant had obtained sufficient resources for him\r\nto cross over to Ireland.\r\n\r\n(M493)\r\n\r\nBefore he set sail a complete victory had been already gained over\r\nOrmond’s forces before Dublin. The news of the success was despatched to\r\nthe mayor of London by letter from the Council of State (11 Aug.), who\r\nordered particulars of the victory to be printed and published in every\r\nchurch within the lines of communication and thanks to be rendered to\r\nAlmighty God for his great goodness.(966) The 29th August was accordingly\r\nkept as a day of public thanksgiving, and whilst the Commons attended\r\ndivine service at St. Margaret’s, Westminster, the municipal authorities\r\nlistened to sermons at Christchurch, Newgate, and afterwards dined\r\ntogether at Mercers’ Hall.(967)\r\n\r\n(M494)\r\n\r\nThe citizens kept such a tight hold upon their purse-strings, and the\r\nmoney which they had been called upon to advance came in so slowly, that\r\nthe Council of State began to lose all patience, and on the 22nd August\r\nwrote to the mayor and aldermen(968) reminding them of their remissness in\r\nobeying the council’s previous orders, and informing them that the\r\nsoldiers had got to the end of their pay and wanted more. \"It is not\r\nreasonable,\" the letter went on to say, \"that the country, which is far\r\nless able, should bear the burden of the city, or that the soldiers should\r\nquarter upon them to spare you; and if you suffer free quarter to come\r\nupon you it may produce great inconvenience. You are therefore to take it\r\ninto serious consideration, and you will then be sensible of the effects\r\nthis backwardness in payment may produce. We once more offer this to your\r\nconsideration, resolving not to trouble you hereafter with further\r\nletters, which produce no better effect, but that the same clamour and\r\ncomplaints return to us every week.\"\r\n\r\n(M495)\r\n\r\nOn the 25th August Glyn, the city’s Recorder, yielded to pressure and\r\nresigned his office. An attempt had been made in January, 1648, to get him\r\nto resign in favour of William Steele, but he managed to keep his place\r\nnotwithstanding his being a prisoner and threatened with impeachment at\r\nthe time. On the 9th August, 1649, the Court of Aldermen desired him to\r\nsurrender his place on the ground that both law and the custom of the city\r\ndemanded that the Recorder of the city should be an apprentice of the law\r\nand not a sergeant-at-law.(969) The plea was a shallow one, and Glyn\r\ndeclined to accede to their request, as being prejudicial to himself and\r\nas casting a slur upon his profession. This answer he made on the 18th\r\nAugust. Nevertheless by that day week he had thought better of it, and\r\ncame into court and there \"freely tendred\" his resignation, which was\r\naccepted as \"his own free voluntary act.\" The court voted him the sum of\r\n£300 in recognition of his past services and appointed William Steele in\r\nhis place.(970)\r\n\r\n(M496)\r\n\r\nWhen Michaelmas-day, the day of election of a fresh mayor, arrived Andrews\r\nwas not re-elected, to the disappointment of a large number of citizens,\r\nwho petitioned the Common Council to enquire into the manner in which the\r\nelections had taken place. The court, whilst declaring that the election\r\nhad been carried out according to custom, was willing to appoint a\r\ncommittee to search the City’s Records with the view of getting more\r\ndefinite information as to the mode of such election, as well as to\r\nenquire into charges that had been publicly made against Sir John\r\nWollaston in connection with the recent election. Andrews himself appears\r\nto have suffered no little disappointment, if we may judge from his not\r\npresiding at any Common Council or Court of Aldermen after the 9th\r\nOctober, leaving that duty to Foote, the lord mayor elect, as his _locum\r\ntenens_.(971)\r\n\r\n(M497)\r\n\r\nA few days before Andrews quitted the mayoralty the Guildhall was the\r\nscene of one of those trials for which it is historically famous. On the\r\n24th October (1649) John Lilburne was brought to trial for spreading\r\nseditious pamphlets. Parliament had shown every disposition to conciliate\r\nthis impracticable reformer, but all its efforts had been futile. \"Tell\r\nyour masters from me,\" said he to a friend who visited him in the Tower,\r\n\"that if it were possible for me now to choose, I had rather choose to\r\nlive seven years under old King Charles’s government (notwithstanding\r\ntheir beheading him as a tyrant for it) when it was at the worst before\r\nthis parliament, than live one year under their present government that\r\nnow rule; nay, let me tell you, if they go on with that tyranny they are\r\nin, they will make Prince Charles have friends enow not only to cry him\r\nup, but also really to fight for him to bring him into his father’s\r\nthrone.\"(972) His trial was at length forced on parliament by the\r\ninjudicious publication of a pamphlet(973) calculated to excite discontent\r\nin the army, and a mutiny broke out in the garrison at Oxford so soon\r\nafter the issue of this pamphlet that it was justly thought to have\r\noccasioned the outbreak. The country became flooded with seditious\r\npamphlets to such an extent that an Act was passed for their suppression\r\nand for the better regulation of printing. The civic authorities and the\r\nStationers’ Company were especially admonished to see the provisions of\r\nthe Act carried out.(974) What brought matters to a climax was the\r\ndiscovery that the Levellers were entering upon negotiations with Prince\r\nCharles, and thereupon the House resolved (11 Sept.) that Lilburne’s trial\r\nshould at once be proceeded with.(975) A special commission of Oyer and\r\nTerminer, presided over by Andrews, the outgoing Lord Mayor, and including\r\nthe Recorder, the Common Sergeant and nine aldermen, was opened at the\r\nGuildhall on Wednesday, the 24th October. The trial lasted three days.\r\nLilburne made a spirited defence, winding up with a solemn peroration in\r\nwhich he invoked God Almighty to guide and direct the jury \"to do that\r\nwhich is just, and for His glory.\" His words sent a thrill of enthusiasm\r\nthrough the crowded hall, the audience with \"an extraordinary great hum\"\r\ngiving vent to cries of \"Amen! Amen!\" in such a manner that Skippon, who\r\nwas in attendance, deemed it advisable to send for more troops in case of\r\ndisturbance. When in the end a verdict of acquittal was brought in, a wild\r\nscene followed. \"The whole multitude in the hall, for joy of the\r\nprisoner’s acquittal, gave such a loud and unanimous shout as is believed\r\nwas never heard in Guildhall, which lasted for about half an hour without\r\nintermission.\" The judges turned pale from fear, but the prisoner at the\r\nbar, so far from displaying any excess of joy, remained unmoved and\r\nsilent, and \"rather more sad in his countenance than he was before.\"(976)\r\nHe was conducted back to the Tower, whence he had been brought, amid the\r\nacclamations of the multitude. At night bonfires were lighted in his\r\nhonour. The government made an attempt to detain him still in prison, but\r\nin about a fortnight the general discontent of the people and the\r\nintercession of friends procured his liberation.\r\n\r\n(M498) (M499)\r\n\r\nThe citizens of London further testified their appreciation of this\r\nchampion of liberty by electing him a member of their Common Council on\r\nSt. Thomas’s Day (21 Dec.), but upon the mayor and aldermen representing\r\nthe case to parliament the House declared his election void by\r\nstatute.(977) The matter, however, was compromised by Lilburne consenting\r\nto take the engagement \"with a declaration of his own sense upon it.\"(978)\r\nPhilip Chetwyn, a man somewhat of Lilburne’s stamp, who had interested\r\nhimself in Lilburne’s election, was ordered by parliament to lose the\r\nfreedom of the City, and was committed to Warwick Castle.(979)\r\n\r\n(M500) (M501)\r\n\r\nColonel Pride, whose famous \"purge\" had reduced the House to a mere shadow\r\nof its former self, and who was elected a member of the Common Council on\r\nthe same day as Lilburne, was allowed to take his seat without\r\nobjection,(980) whilst Colonel John Fenton was declared by the House to be\r\ndisabled from service as a Common Councilman. On the other hand, the\r\nroyalist alderman, Major-General Browne, had to go, notwithstanding his\r\npast services to parliament and the army. According to the record of the\r\nvotes of the House of Commons for the 4th December, 1649, preserved in the\r\nJournal of the Common Council, Browne was not only dismissed from\r\nparliament, but was also discharged and disabled from being an alderman of\r\nthe city; but in the Journal of the House itself the latter resolution\r\nrelating to his discharge from his aldermanry was subsequently erased, and\r\na note subscribed to the effect that the vote was vacated by order of\r\nparliament made the 26th March, 1659.(981)\r\n\r\n(M502)\r\n\r\nThe late troubles had sadly depleted the city’s Chamber as well as\r\nincreased the number of the poor within the city’s walls. It became\r\nnecessary to appoint a committee (18 Sept., 1649) to examine the state of\r\nthe city’s finances. The result was that in the following December the\r\nCommon Council resolved to cut down the table expenses of the mayor and\r\nsheriffs, which were found to have materially increased since they were\r\nlast taken in hand in 1555.(982) Thenceforth it was to be unlawful for any\r\nmayor or sheriff to be served at dinner with more than one course; nor\r\nwere they to have at any time \"any more sundry dishes of meat at that one\r\ncourse, to a mess of ten or twelve persons, upon the Lord’s day, Tuesday,\r\nThursday or any ordinary festival day, than seaven, whether the same be\r\nhot or cold.\" One or two of the dishes might (if they pleased) be brought\r\nto the table hot \"after the first five or six be served.\" On Monday,\r\nWednesday, Friday or Saturday the course was to comprise not more than\r\nfive sundry dishes of meat or six of fish, to be served in such order as\r\nthey pleased. _Hors d’œuvres_, such as \"brawne, callups with eggs,\r\nsallettes, broth, butter, cheese, eggs, herings, shrimps,\" and dishes\r\n\"serveinge onely for settinge forth and furnisheinge the table at any of\r\nthe said dinners or feasts and not there to be cutt or eaten,\" were not to\r\nbe accounted among the dishes thus limited. Similar restrictions were\r\nplaced upon the diet of the members of the household of the mayor and\r\nsheriffs, and no lord mayor or sheriff was to \"make any feast\" on entering\r\nor leaving office.(983)\r\n\r\n(M503)\r\n\r\nHitherto the mayor and sheriffs for the time being had been accustomed to\r\nsell offices and places as they happened to become vacant and to use the\r\nmoney so obtained towards defraying the expenses of their own year of\r\noffice. This was to be no longer allowed. They were henceforth to be\r\ncontent with the allowance made to them by the Common Council, viz., a\r\nmonthly allowance of £208 6_s._ 8_d._ for the mayor, and a monthly\r\nallowance of £150 to each of the sheriffs.\r\n\r\n(M504)\r\n\r\nA committee was at the same time appointed to manage and let to farm to\r\nthe best advantage for the City a number of offices, including those of\r\ngarbling, package and scavage, metage of grain, coal, salt and fruit, as\r\nwell as all fines, issues, amerciaments and estreated recognisances under\r\nthe greenwax. It was to have entire control over the City’s new\r\nacquisition, Richmond Park, the timber of which it was empowered to sell\r\n(notwithstanding a proviso in the Act of Parliament to the contrary), as\r\nwell as the woods of the manors of Middleham and Richmond, which formed\r\npart of the Royal Contract estate in Yorkshire. All sums of money thus\r\nraised were to be paid forthwith into the Chamber.(984)\r\n\r\n(M505)\r\n\r\nThe question how to deal with the poor of the city had been for some time\r\npast growing more pressing every day, and in September last (1649) the\r\n\"President and Governors for the Poor of the city\" suggested to the Common\r\nCouncil the establishment of a postal system as a means of raising money\r\nfor the purpose. The court welcomed the proposal, and promised to forward\r\nany scheme that might be laid before it.(985) A committee was appointed\r\n(25 Sept.) to wait upon the Earl of Warwick, Prideaux, the\r\nattorney-general, and Witheringe, who had the management of the inland\r\npost—a government monopoly recently established—and inform them of the\r\ndesire of the court \"that the President and Governors for the Poor of the\r\ncity of London may use and dispose of the said postage for the good of the\r\npoor, without any obstructions from them in the work.\"(986) An attempt\r\n(M506) to lay a petition before parliament on Friday, the 16th November,\r\nhaving failed, the deputation not being admitted, the court appointed a\r\ncommittee (24 Nov.) to consider the best way of setting the scheme on foot\r\nwithout delay.(987) The committee had (M507) not proceeded far in the\r\nmatter when it was deemed advisable (23 Jan., 1650) to take counsel’s\r\nopinion as to whether there might not be some danger of a _Quo Warranto_\r\nagainst the City before allowing any further steps to be taken.(988) For a\r\nfortnight, therefore, matters were in abeyance, but on the 6th February,\r\n1650, the opinion of counsel having presumably been favourable to the\r\ncity’s action, the committee received instructions to proceed to settle\r\nstages and other matters connected with a postal system without\r\ndelay.(989) Before another six weeks had elapsed the City had established\r\na postal system with Scotland and other places. Complaint was thereupon\r\n(M508) made to parliament (21 March) \"that the Common Council of London\r\nhave sent an agent to settle postages, by their authority, on the several\r\nroads; and have employed a natural Scot into the North, who is gone into\r\nScotland; and hath settled postmasters (other than those for the State) on\r\nall that road.\"(990) The Common Council, it was said, had \"refused to come\r\nto the parliament and to have direction from them in it,\" but this\r\nstatement is not borne out by the City’s Records, according to which, as\r\nalready narrated, a deputation had at least on one occasion waited on the\r\nHouse, but had not been admitted. Fortified by the opinion of the (M509)\r\nattorney-general and of the Council of State, the Commons passed a\r\nresolution to the effect \"that the offices of postmaster, inland and\r\nforeign, are and ought to be in the sole power and disposal of the\r\nparliament.\"(991) In the face of this resolution (M510) the City could\r\nproceed no further. A petition to parliament was drafted, but failed to\r\nget the approval of the Common Council, and the City posts were summarily\r\nsuppressed.(992)\r\n\r\n(M511)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime steps had been taken towards raising a fund from the\r\ninhabitants of the wards to enable the municipal authorities to find work\r\nfor the poor.(993) On the 2nd April the President and Governors for the\r\nPoor of the city reported to the Common Council that they stood in need of\r\n£12,000 at the least, in order to start the poor on work. The court\r\nthought best to begin by raising only £4,000, and there was some talk of\r\napplying to parliament to increase (if need be) the powers of the\r\nCorporation for the Poor, so as to charge both real and personal estate in\r\nassessments.(994) A year ago (6 June, 1649) parliament had assisted the\r\nCity with the sum of £1,000 towards the relief of the poor, and had\r\nconsented to convey to the municipal authorities a certain storehouse in\r\nthe Minories, as well as the wardrobe near the Blackfriars, the latter to\r\nbe used as a work-house.(995) The City now took the opportunity of\r\nthanking the Commons for these gifts as well as for the gift of Richmond\r\nPark, and promised to stand by them \"against all wicked practices and\r\nopposite pretended powers whatsoever.\"(996)\r\n\r\n(M512)\r\n\r\nThere was another matter of municipal interest which claimed the attention\r\nof the civic authorities about this time. Ever since 1550, when, as we\r\nhave seen, the borough of Southwark first became completely subject to the\r\njurisdiction of the city, the inhabitants of the borough had suffered from\r\nthe anomalous position of being ruled by an alderman not of their\r\nchoosing, and by a Common Council to which they sent no representatives.\r\nNevertheless, it was not until the close of 1649 that they began to raise\r\nany serious objection to the existing state of things.  On the 4th\r\nDecember of that year they petitioned parliament that they might be\r\nincorporated or enfranchised either with or without the City, on the\r\nground that, as matters stood, their poor were neglected and they suffered\r\nfrom \"diversity of jurisdictions,\" under which they were subjected to\r\n\"double service and charges,\" such as no other body suffered throughout\r\nthe kingdom.(997)\r\n\r\n(M513)\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year (28 Jan., 1650) the City presented a counter\r\npetition in defence of its rights and privileges in Southwark, and the\r\nwhole matter was referred by parliament to the Committee for\r\nCorporations.(998) The inhabitants of Southwark having submitted their\r\ncase to the committee, the City were called upon to make reply.(999) They,\r\nin effect, denied that the inconveniences mentioned by the petitioners\r\nwere caused by their being under the City’s government. As to the alleged\r\ngrievance of being subject to concurrent jurisdictions, that was nothing\r\nuncommon. Not that the City itself countenanced variety of jurisdiction\r\nover the borough. Far from it. In fact, the civic authorities had recently\r\nthemselves applied to parliament for the removal of the \"Court Marshall\"\r\n(or Marshalsea) and the abolition of the \"Marshall of the Upper Bench\"\r\nfrom the borough. The answer concluded by assuring the Committee for\r\nCorporations that if any inconveniences arose in the borough from any\r\ndefect in the City’s government the City would be pleased to receive the\r\nassistance of the inhabitants in asking the supreme authority of\r\nparliament to amend it.  No defect, however, could justify the separation\r\nof the borough from the City. There was another objection. The\r\nincorporation of Southwark would not only be an invasion of the City’s\r\nrights, but would work injury to the several companies and fraternities of\r\nthe city which for trade purposes had become incorporated. These exercised\r\ntheir power of government over, and received support from, their members\r\nwho were not exclusively inhabitants of the city, but dwellers in the\r\nsuburbs two or three miles away. A conference was proposed between the\r\nparties,(1000) but nothing appears to have come of it, and the matter was\r\nallowed to rest for another hundred years and more.\r\n\r\n(M514) (M515)\r\n\r\nCromwell had not been long in Ireland before the country began to assume\r\nat least a semblance of prosperity. The good achieved by the city of\r\nLondon and the companies in Ulster in the earlier years of the plantation\r\nhad well nigh disappeared during the troublous times of the civil war.\r\nLondonderry itself had suffered two sieges at the hands of the royalists,\r\nbut the garrison on both occasions had displayed the same indomitable\r\ncourage as that which in later years made them famous in the pages of\r\nhistory, and with like success. Cruel as was Cromwell’s policy in Ireland\r\nit accomplished its object. By February, 1650, Bradshaw was able to write\r\nto the mayor of London(1001) informing him of the intention of the Council\r\nof State to \"plant\" the seaports in Ulster, which had by God’s blessing\r\nbeen reduced to obedience. He understood that the City had or \"pretended\r\nto have\" some interest in the towns of Londonderry and Coleraine, with\r\nother lands and fishings in Ulster, and he desired to know if the City\r\nintended to vindicate its right or claim. If so, the lord mayor was\r\nadvised to depute someone to attend the committee appointed by the Council\r\nof State for Irish affairs and explain to him the nature of the City’s\r\nrights. This letter having been read to the Court of Aldermen on the 19th\r\nFebruary, counsel was instructed to investigate the City’s interest in\r\nIreland.(1002) A committee of aldermen was subsequently appointed to\r\nconfer with representatives of the several livery companies on the matter.\r\nAlthough Bradshaw’s letter had desired a speedy reply, it was not until\r\nthe 9th May that a report was submitted to the Court of Aldermen. This\r\nreport, which had received the assent of the companies, recommended that\r\ncounsel should forthwith be instructed to assert the rights of the City\r\nand the companies to the towns and lands originally conveyed by letters\r\npatents of the 30th March, 1613, to the Irish Society.(1003)\r\n\r\n(M516)\r\n\r\nWhen Cromwell returned to England at the end of May (1650), having all but\r\nstamped out the rebellion in Ireland, he was met at Hounslow Heath by a\r\nhuge concourse of people, including many members of parliament and the\r\nchief officers of the army. At Hyde Park, where it is said that the lord\r\nmayor and the militia awaited him, although no directions to that effect\r\nappear in the City’s Records, he was received with a volley of\r\nartillery.(1004) He had returned at the express desire of parliament, who\r\nrequired his services in Scotland. No time was lost. On Wednesday, the\r\n26th June, an Act was passed constituting him \"commander-in-chief of all\r\nthe forces raised or to be raised by the authority of parliament within\r\nthe Commonwealth of England,\"(1005) in place of Fairfax, and on the\r\nfollowing Saturday he set out for the North.\r\n\r\n(M517)\r\n\r\nTwo days before parliament thus transferred the command of the army from\r\nFairfax to Cromwell, Charles II had landed in Scotland and Fairfax had\r\ndisplayed some scruples in opposing the Scots, who, as he declared, had a\r\nright to choose their own form of government. Not so Cromwell. He saw the\r\ndanger that was likely to arise from such a concession, and he resolved\r\nforthwith to make an attempt on Edinburgh. He was, however, out-manœuvred\r\nby Leslie and forced to fall back upon Dunbar. There he was fortunate\r\nenough to utterly rout the Scottish forces (3 Sept.) by one of those\r\ndashing cavalry charges for which his \"Ironsides\" were famous.\r\n\r\n(M518)\r\n\r\nThis victory, which contributed more perhaps than anything else to\r\nestablish the Commonwealth, was celebrated in the city by a public\r\nthanksgiving. A \"convenient dinner\" was ordered by the Common Council (12\r\nSept.) to be provided for that day, to which Major-General Harrison,\r\nMajor-General Skippon, the lieutenant of the Tower, and others were to be\r\ninvited. The City’s latest acquisition, the New Park at Richmond, was laid\r\nunder contribution for venison. The dinner was not on this occasion paid\r\nfor out of the City’s cash, owing probably to the low condition of the\r\nChamber, but was defrayed by the payment of ten shillings by each alderman\r\nand five shillings by each commoner.(1006) The names of those who refused\r\nto observe the day of thanksgiving were afterwards ordered to be taken and\r\ncertified by the mayor to parliament.(1007)\r\n\r\n(M519)\r\n\r\nA few weeks later (22 Oct.) the city forces and those of Middlesex to the\r\nnumber of 8,000 mustered in Hyde Park, where they were addressed by the\r\nSpeaker and members of the House. Before the end of the month a contingent\r\nof recruits from London was on its way to join the army in Scotland, \"but\r\nnear half of them,\" we are told, \"ran away in their march, and listed\r\nthemselves in the garrisons of Newcastle and other garrisons by the\r\nway.\"(1008)\r\n\r\n(M520)\r\n\r\nAt Michaelmas Andrews was once more elected mayor. The proceedings of the\r\ncommittee appointed a twelvemonth ago to enquire into the mode of electing\r\nthe mayor of London have not come down to us. Possibly the committee made\r\nno report, for a new committee was nominated a few days before Andrews was\r\nre-elected, \"to consider what may be the most right and fitt way for\r\nelectinge of all that are wont to bee by the Comon Hall.\"(1009) On the\r\n26th September (1650) a report on the subject was laid before the Common\r\nCouncil, and consideration adjourned.(1010) On the 14th October, the court\r\nhaving considered the report, came to the following resolution:—(1011)\r\n\"That it apeareth to them by the auncient charters of this citty that the\r\nlord maior and sheriffs of this citty are eligible by the comons and\r\ncitizens of this cittie and that the eleccon of the lord maior and\r\nsheriffs was aunciently by severall persons chosen out of the wards joyned\r\nwith the Common Councell. And that the same waye is most convenient still\r\nto bee continued.\"\r\n\r\n(M521)\r\n\r\nThe matter was not allowed, however, to rest here. Petitions were sent in\r\nby the livery companies, and debate followed debate until the 7th\r\nDecember, when the court put a stop to further discussion by ordering that\r\n\"this busines shalbee wholey laid aside.\"(1012) A year later (4 Nov.,\r\n1651) the Common Council passed an Act much to the same effect as the\r\nabove resolution. Elections in Common Hall were thenceforth to be by the\r\naldermen, common councilmen and \"a like number of other honest men\" of\r\neach ward, and not by the companies.(1013)\r\n\r\n(M522)\r\n\r\nAlthough the kingly office as forming part of the Constitution had been\r\ndeclared by parliament to be abolished immediately after the execution of\r\nCharles, emblems of royalty might still be seen displayed in the city and\r\nelsewhere many months afterwards. On the western façade of St. Paul’s, for\r\nexample, there remained statues of James and of Charles. These the Court\r\nof Aldermen had been ordered to remove (31 July, 1650). They were further\r\nordered to see that the head of Charles’s statue at the Royal Exchange was\r\nstruck off, the sceptre in the effigy’s hand broken, and an inscription\r\nset up hard by proclaiming the abolition of tyranny—_Exit Tyrannus Regum\r\nUltimus_—and the dawn of liberty. On the 14th August the entire statue was\r\nordered to be removed.(1014) This was done, and on the following day a\r\ncertificate to that effect, under the hand of the Town Clerk, was\r\nforwarded to the Council of State.(1015) Nevertheless there were many\r\nplaces, many churches and companies’ halls in the city, where the royal\r\narms and portraits of the late king had been allowed still to remain, and\r\nthese the Council of State directed the mayor and aldermen in December to\r\nsearch for and cause to be removed.(1016) In February, 1651, the Court of\r\nAldermen showed greater activity in the matter, and the lord mayor was\r\ndirected to issue the necessary precept for the removal of all\r\n\"monarchichal armes.\"(1017)\r\n\r\n(M523)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, oppressed as the citizens were with constant demands on\r\ntheir purses, they contributed what they could toward the relief of the\r\nsick and poor of the army in the North,(1018) and on the 7th March, 1651,\r\ntheir efforts were rewarded by a letter of thanks from the lord general\r\nhimself.(1019)\r\n\r\n(M524)\r\n\r\nTo such an extent were they ground down by taxation (the city alone being\r\nassessed at a fifteenth of the whole kingdom) that a petition was ordered\r\nto be laid before parliament on the subject a fortnight later (24\r\nMarch).(1020) Whilst acknowledging the care bestowed by parliament in\r\nmanaging the affairs of the nation at the least possible charge, and\r\ndeclaring their willingness to bear their share in defraying expenses with\r\nthe rest of the nation, the petitioners prayed for a more equitable amount\r\nof taxation than that which they had hitherto been called upon to bear.\r\nThe reasons they gave were (1) the losses which merchants had sustained\r\nwithin the last few years by the interruption of foreign trade, vessels\r\nbelonging to citizens of London having been constantly seized by Prince\r\nRupert and others who roamed the seas for piratical purposes, and (2) the\r\nwithdrawal of the wealthier class of citizens to the suburbs of London,\r\nwhere houses were increasing, and where taxation was less than in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n(M525)\r\n\r\nBefore the House found time to take this petition into consideration(1021)\r\nit had granted (8 April) authority to the Council of State to raise out of\r\nthe militias of the several counties a force of horse and dragoons not\r\nexceeding the number of 3,000 horse and 1,000 dragoons. The civic\r\nauthorities lost no time in representing to parliament that the City had\r\nalways been exempt from the charge of providing horse. They were ready,\r\nhowever, to bear their proportion of the necessary charge with the rest of\r\nthe kingdom.(1022) Later on they became more complaisant, and expressed\r\ntheir readiness to furnish the number of horse demanded \"in respect of the\r\npressing occasions and necessities now lying on the Commonwealth,\"\r\nnotwithstanding the proportion laid on the City was greater than that\r\nimposed on any other part of the nation. It was stipulated that the City’s\r\nassent was not to be drawn into a precedent for the future.(1023) The\r\nCouncil of State, on the other hand, would not for a moment allow that the\r\nCity had been called upon to contribute more than its just proportion.\r\nLondon was a large place, they said, where many opportunities arose for\r\noutbreaks, and where there was not always a force at hand to put them\r\ndown. They doubted not there were many well-affected persons within\r\nLondon, Westminster, the Hamlets and Southwark, able and willing to lend\r\ntheir horses, with well-affected riders, for the prevention of mischief,\r\nand they recommended that such should be encouraged.(1024)\r\n\r\n(M526)\r\n\r\nIn June (1651) another attempt at retrenchment was made by the City. A\r\ncommittee was appointed \"to examine what profits or perquisites have been\r\nreceived by the lord mayor and sheriffs or belong to their places, and how\r\nthey came so to belong or to be received\" whilst another committee was\r\nappointed \"to consider how the service, honour and attendance of the lord\r\nmayor and sheriffs of this city may be continued with all befitting\r\nabatement of diet and all other charges.\"(1025) The result of the enquiry\r\nwas to cut down the profits and perquisites hitherto attaching to the\r\noffice of lord mayor to such an extent that when John Kendricke was\r\nelected to the chair on the following Michaelmas-day (29 Sept., 1651) he,\r\nbeing without sufficient private estate, represented to the Court of\r\nAldermen (2 Oct.) that he could not undertake the office \"upon such terms\r\nas never any had done before him, the ancient perquisites and late\r\nallowances made in consideration thereof being wholly taken away.\"(1026)\r\nHe was afterwards prevailed upon by his brother aldermen to change his\r\nmind and accept office, declaring that he did so \"for the city’s quiet and\r\npeace, and in hope and expectation of all due and fit\r\nencouragements.\"(1027)\r\n\r\n(M527)\r\n\r\nEver since the passing of the Act of Parliament of the 28th February,\r\n1649, the relations between the court of Aldermen, including the lord\r\nmayor for the time being, and the court of Common Council had become more\r\nand more strained. It had become a common practice whenever the Common\r\nCouncil made a proposition distasteful to the mayor and aldermen for his\r\nlordship and such aldermen as happened to be present to break up the court\r\nby taking their departure. Mention has already been made of two occasions\r\n(viz., 13 Jan., 1649, and 14 June, 1650) on which the mayor and aldermen\r\ntook this method of expressing their dissatisfaction with the Common\r\nCouncil. They took the same course again on the 2nd July, 1651.(1028)\r\n\r\n(M528)\r\n\r\nThe aldermen complained of other encroachments on their rights and\r\nprivileges by the Common Council, and determined to lay their case before\r\nthe Council of State. They objected (1) to the commons increasing the\r\nnumber of members sitting on committees, and making a quorum without any\r\nalderman being present; (2) to the commons taking upon themselves to\r\nappoint the executive officers of the mayor and sheriffs, and abolishing\r\nperquisites whereby the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs were rendered unable\r\nto fulfil their duties; (3) to the assumption by the commons of control\r\nover the city’s lands; and (4) the limitation of the right of aldermen to\r\ndraw upon the Chamber.(1029) The government endeavoured to arrange matters\r\nby the appointment of a committee (8 Oct.) to confer with representatives\r\nfrom the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council, and, failing an agreement,\r\nto lay the whole matter before parliament for final determination.(1030)\r\nThe livery also petitioned parliament against the innovations introduced\r\nby the recent Act of Common Council (4 Nov., 1651), depriving them of\r\ntheir right of election in Common Hall.(1031)\r\n\r\n(M529)\r\n\r\nWhen the Common Council was about to hear a report by their own committee\r\nupon this subject of \"perquisites and incroachments,\" they directed the\r\nCommon Sergeant to desire the lord mayor and aldermen to withdraw. This,\r\nhowever, they declined to do.(1032)\r\n\r\n(M530)\r\n\r\nIn February of the next year (1652) the question of allowances to be made\r\nto the mayor and sheriffs was referred to another committee, with the\r\nresult that in the following June the court voted an allowance to lord\r\nmayor Kendricke of £1,500, the same to be reduced by £100 for succeeding\r\nlord mayors, and an allowance of £600 to each of the sheriffs present and\r\nto come. Neither mayor nor sheriffs were to be allowed \"standing\r\nhouses.\"(1033) The matter, however, was by no means settled. On the 13th\r\nAugust the court reverted to the old system of perquisites, and resolved\r\n\"that the succeeding lord mayors and sheriffs of this city shall have\r\nallowances from this city towards the maintenance of their public charges,\r\nand that those allowances shall be the ancient perquisites\r\nthemselves.\"(1034) This was followed a month later (15 Sept.) by another\r\nresolution to the effect that future sheriffs should have no allowances\r\nfrom the city other than the perquisites.(1035)\r\n\r\n(M531) (M532)\r\n\r\nThe election of a successor to Kendricke on Michaelmas-day in the person\r\nof Simon Edmonds was made the occasion of fixing the amount of profits the\r\nnew mayor was to enjoy from the various offices of package, scavage,\r\nmetage and others.(1036) Edmonds, like his predecessor in office, had\r\nreported to the Court of Aldermen soon after his election that he could\r\nnot undertake the charge of the mayoralty without those \"encouragements\r\nand allowances\" which former lord mayors had enjoyed.(1037) Finding that\r\nEdmonds could not be brought to accept their terms,(1038) the Common\r\nCouncil discharged him from service (19 Oct.) on the plea of old age and\r\nill-health, but fined him £600.(1039) The Court of Aldermen subsequently\r\ndischarged him from his aldermanry.(1040)\r\n\r\n(M533)\r\n\r\nJohn Fowke, who succeeded to the mayoralty in place of Edmonds,(1041)\r\nalways insisted upon his right to know for what purpose a Common Council\r\nwas required before he would accede to a request to summon one,(1042) and\r\nupon quitting office he made a speech in Common Hall reflecting upon the\r\nproceedings of the Common Council. His speech was referred to a committee,\r\nwith instructions to consider at the same time his grievances and to\r\nendeavour to bring matters to a peaceful issue.(1043) The committee\r\npresented their report to the council on the 24th October (1653). Fowke,\r\nwho still occupied the mayoralty chair, got up and left the court as soon\r\nas the report had been read.(1044) He was found by the committee to have\r\nbeen guilty of various misdemeanours, such as withholding the common seal\r\nand refusing to allow leases to be stamped with it, appointing his own son\r\nto various places, making an open assault upon the custom-house and\r\nseizing the rights and profits of the city to his own use.(1045) Thereupon\r\nthe court resolved to appeal to parliament—not the Rump, for that had been\r\nsent to the right about(1046) by Cromwell six months before (20 April,\r\n1653), but to \"Barebones parliament,\" the parliament composed of\r\nCromwell’s own nominees—to take in hand Fowke’s conduct and to restore to\r\nthe citizens those rights of which he had deprived them.(1047) Nothing\r\nappears, however, to have come of the petition. On the 22nd September\r\n(1653) the Common Council resolved that Fowke’s successor should enjoy\r\n\"all the perquisites and profits which any lord mayor hath enjoyed for\r\ntwenty years last past, before the yeare of our Lord one thousand six\r\nhundred and forty and nine.\"(1048)\r\n\r\n(M534)\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of finding an alderman willing to undertake the office of\r\nmayor under the new regulations was as nothing compared with that of\r\ngetting men to serve as sheriffs and aldermen, and the Chamber of the city\r\nwas largely benefitted by the payment of fines for discharge from\r\nservice.(1049) One concession the court of Common Council made to the\r\nsheriffs, and that was to relieve them of the payment of certain fee-farm\r\nrents due from sheriffs for the time being.(1050) Nevertheless the\r\nshrievalty became so unpopular that an order had to be passed against\r\naldermen who had not already served as sheriff resigning their gowns for\r\nthe purpose of avoiding service.(1051)\r\n\r\n(M535)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Leslie’s defeat at Dunbar, there still remained a strong\r\nroyalist army in Scotland, which, in August of the following year, was\r\npushed on into England with the hope of raising an insurrection in favour\r\nof Charles before Cromwell could overtake it. As soon as this sudden\r\nmovement became known Cromwell wrote (4 Aug.) to parliament to gather a\r\nforce together with all possible speed to hold the enemy in check until\r\nhis arrival.(1052)\r\n\r\n(M536)\r\n\r\nThe House at once (11 Aug.) communicated with the Common Council, who\r\npledged themselves, with God’s grace, to adventure their lives and\r\nestates, and to use their best endeavours in the defence of parliament and\r\nthe Commonwealth against the king of Scotland and all who should invade\r\nEngland on his behalf.(1053) The City’s Records are again provokingly\r\nmeagre at this period, yielding us but scanty information on matters which\r\nmust have deeply affected the citizens in general. From other sources,\r\nhowever, we learn that three regiments of volunteers were formed in London\r\nand its suburbs for the special purpose of serving as a guard to\r\nparliament. The powers of the Committee for the Militia of the City were\r\nenlarged, and the number of members increased by fifteen individuals,\r\namong whom was Lieutenant-Colonel John Fenton, who had been removed from\r\nthe Common Council by order of parliament. The militia throughout the\r\ncountry was called out, and a month’s pay ordered to be advanced by \"each\r\nperson who finds horsemen or footmen,\" the same to be repaid by\r\nassessments authorised by parliament. Anyone joining the Scottish army or\r\ninducing others to join, anyone found with papers or declarations of the\r\nScottish king in his hands, or discovered inciting to a breach of the\r\npeace, was declared to be a traitor, and as such would be executed. Within\r\nthe late lines of communication strict supervision was to be kept over all\r\nhouses. Lodgers’ names were to be taken and registered; servants and\r\nchildren were to be allowed out of doors only at certain hours. The\r\nexecution of these and similar orders was entrusted to the lord mayor and\r\nthe rest of the Committee for the Militia of the City in conjunction with\r\nthe Commissioners for the Militia of Westminster, the Hamlets and\r\nSouthwark, who were required to meet and sit daily for the purpose. A\r\ntroop of horse was to be forthwith despatched to meet the invaders, the\r\nmen to be mounted on horses lately seized in London and its neighbourhood,\r\nthe proprietors of which were to receive tickets for payment of their\r\nvalue in case any of them should be \"lost or spoiled.\"(1054)\r\n\r\n(M537)\r\n\r\nOn the 25th August a letter (dated 16 Aug.) from Charles, addressed \"to\r\nour trusty and well-beloved the lord mayor, aldermen and sheriffs of our\r\ncity of London,\" was read before parliament. The character of the letter\r\nwas such that the House ordered it to be publicly burnt by the common\r\nhangman at the Exchange on the following day.(1055) A copy of it was\r\nafterwards burnt (2 Sept.) at the head of every regiment of the trained\r\nbands on the occasion of a muster in Finsbury Fields in the presence of\r\nLenthall, the Speaker, the lord mayor and the sheriffs, amid shouts and\r\nacclamations.(1056) On the same day Charles, who had recently (22 Aug.)\r\nset up his standard at Worcester, and all his aiders and abettors were\r\ndenounced by parliament as rebels and traitors.\r\n\r\n(M538)\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Wednesday, the 3rd September—the anniversary of his\r\nvictory at Dunbar Cromwell made himself master of Worcester after \"as\r\nstiff a contest for four or five hours\" as he declared himself ever to\r\nhave seen;(1057) and Charles was driven forth to wander up and down the\r\ncountry with a price put on his capture,(1058) until, by the aid of still\r\nfaithful friends, he managed to slip over to France. A day for solemn\r\nhumiliation (23 Sept.), as well as a day for public thanksgiving (2 Oct.,\r\nafterwards changed to 24 Oct.) was set aside by parliament for deliverance\r\nfrom threatened danger,(1059) whilst the City not only appointed a day for\r\nthanksgiving (16 Oct.) for the \"several victories\" obtained by the\r\nparliamentary forces, but kept the anniversary of the battle of Worcester\r\nby performing \"the exercise of that day in Laurance Church.\"(1060)\r\n\r\n(M539)\r\n\r\nFor some days following the battle of Worcester the streets of the city\r\nwere filled with Scottish prisoners of every degree passing on their way\r\nto the Tower or to the new artillery ground at Tothill Fields. Among those\r\nconveyed to the Tower were the Earls of Cleveland and Lauderdale. As they\r\npassed along Cornhill in their coaches, with a guard of horse, the Earl of\r\nLauderdale was addressed by a by-stander—\"Oh, my lord, you are welcome to\r\nLondon! I protest, off goes your head as round as a hoop!\"(1061) The\r\nill-timed jest, which the earl passed off with a laugh, was wanting in\r\nfulfilment, for he lived to witness the Restoration and to earn the\r\nuniversal hatred of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n(M540)\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 12th September, Cromwell himself reached London, being\r\nbrought on his way by the Speaker, the Lord President and many members of\r\nparliament and Council of State, as well as by the lord mayor, sheriffs\r\nand aldermen of the city, amid shoutings and vollies of ordnance and\r\nmuskets. The modesty and affability of the Lord General was much marked.\r\nOf the part he had himself taken in the battle of Worcester he seldom made\r\nmention, but of the gallantry of the officers and soldiers he was full of\r\npraise, \"and gave (as was due) all the glory of the action unto God.\" On\r\nthe 16th he and his companions in arms received the thanks of the House,\r\nand were afterwards entertained by the City.(1062) Cromwell’s sword was\r\nnow sheathed never to be drawn by him again; the rest of his life was\r\ndevoted to work requiring weapons of a different kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M541)\r\n\r\nThe attempt made to cripple the carrying trade of the Dutch by the passing\r\nof the Navigation Act (Oct., 1651) found little favour with the merchants\r\nof the city. What they of all things desired to see was free trade in the\r\nport of London; and to this end they presented a petition to the Council\r\nfor Trade, and appointed (9 Dec.) a committee to maintain it \"with the\r\nbest reasons they could.\"(1063)\r\n\r\n(M542)\r\n\r\nThis Act failed in its purpose, and only led to retaliation and war. In\r\nthe spring of the following year (1652) the fleet was got ready to put to\r\nsea. On the 26th March the Council of State wrote to the mayor and\r\naldermen and Militia Committee of the city(1064) asking that certain brass\r\nguns laid up at Gresham College and other places in the city should be\r\nforthwith delivered to the ordnance officer, as the guns formerly used in\r\nthe fleet during the late wars had been dispersed among various garrisons.\r\nBy way of postscript—as if an afterthought—the council added: \"As there is\r\na pretension of right made to such guns on behalf of the city we shall be\r\nready to receive and consider any claim which they shall make to them; and\r\nif it appear that they belong to the city we will take care, after the\r\nservice is past to which they are designed, that they are either restored\r\nor satisfaction made according to their value.\" In May it was found that\r\nthe store of gunpowder in the Tower was likely to run short owing to a\r\nbreach of contract, and again application for assistance was made to the\r\nCity, who were asked to lend such gunpowder as lay in the Companies’\r\nhalls.(1065) In March of the following year (1653) the request for guns in\r\nthe City’s magazines to be delivered to the ordnance officers for the\r\npublic service was repeated,(1066) and by November they were all in the\r\ncustody of the lieutenant of the Tower.(1067) By that time a victory had\r\nbeen gained over the Dutch admirals Tromp and De Ruyter off Portland (18\r\nFeb., 1653) by Blake and Monk, the latter having for a time exchanged land\r\nservice for the sea. This success was the more welcome inasmuch as Blake\r\nhad previously suffered a signal defeat (28 Nov., 1652) at the hands of\r\nthe Dutch admirals and had himself been wounded. Moreover Tromp had been\r\nso elated at his victory that in bravado he had fixed a broom to his\r\nmasthead, in token of his resolution to sweep the sea of English vessels.\r\n\r\n(M543)\r\n\r\nThe example set by parliament of opening a subscription for those wounded\r\nat sea was followed by the Common Council of the city. Each member of the\r\ncourt was ordered (4 March) to take steps to \"collect the benevolence of\r\nthe inhabitants in money and old linen, for relief of the wounded soldiers\r\nand mariners which God hath made instrumental in the late great success of\r\nthe Commonwealth at sea against the Dutch.\" In reporting to the court the\r\ntotal amount thus gathered (£1,071 9_s._ 5_d._) Alderman Fowke intimated\r\nthat it was the express wish of many of the contributors that the widows\r\nand children of those that had been killed should share in the charity. To\r\nthis the court agreed.(1068) The money was despatched to the fleet by the\r\nhands of Alderman Tichborne, and gratefully acknowledged by the admirals\r\nDeane and Monk in a letter addressed to the lord mayor (2 April).(1069)\r\nTwo months later Deane was dead, having been killed in another engagement\r\nwith the Dutch, when the English fleet again came off victorious. For this\r\nsuccess a general thanksgiving at St. Paul’s was voted by the Court of\r\nAldermen, who were invited to attend the public funeral of the late\r\ngallant admiral.(1070)\r\n\r\n(M544)\r\n\r\nA few weeks before the Long Parliament was so rudely \"interrupted\" by\r\nCromwell (20 April, 1653) it raised the ire of the Common Council of the\r\ncity by the action of its commissioners, sitting at Haberdashers’ Hall,\r\nwho had prosecuted and fined certain inhabitants of the ward of Farringdon\r\nWithin for having contravened the Act touching election of officers upon\r\nthe Treasonable Engagement.(1071) A deputation from the court was ordered\r\nto wait upon the commissioners and to get some explanation of their\r\nconduct and to report the result of their interview. The commissioners\r\nassumed a very haughty tone. They were, they said, entrusted with full\r\npowers to deal with such matters by parliament, but expressed their\r\nintention to \"be tender to passe severe sentence upon any well affected\r\ncitizen. For that they have power to doe it or not to doe it.\" This was\r\nnot at all to the mind of the Common Council, who thereupon resolved (4\r\nMarch, 1653) to ask parliament to explain who were promoters and abettors\r\nof the Treasonable Engagement, and whether the citizens were to be\r\nconsidered as promoters and abettors for having obeyed the orders of the\r\nmilitia authorised by parliament in manning forts and appearing in arms,\r\nas they so often had done, in defence of parliament as well as of\r\nthemselves.(1072) Before any answer was given to this awkward question the\r\nLong Parliament had ceased to exist, to be succeeded by another of a very\r\ndifferent character.\r\n\r\n(M545)\r\n\r\n\"Praise-God Barebone, Esquire,\" who gave a nick-name to the next\r\nparliament, was a leatherseller of London, and was summoned by Cromwell to\r\nsit as member for the city. \"I, as commander-in-chief of the armies of the\r\nCommonwealth,\" wrote Cromwell to him, \"summon you ... to appear at the\r\ncouncil chamber, Whitehall, on 4th July, and take upon you the said trust\r\nfor the city of London.\"(1073) The rest of the members of this Puritan\r\nparliament were for the most part also Cromwell’s nominees.  It was\r\ndestined to be short lived. It attacked the law and the Church and\r\nthreatened the universities. To save the last mentioned institutions the\r\ncity of London intervened and received the thanks of the university of\r\nOxford.(1074) Afraid of their own acts, which they felt were displeasing\r\nto Cromwell, they agreed to dissolve parliament and to transfer their\r\npowers to the man from whom they had received them. This took place\r\nsomewhat suddenly and unexpectedly on the 12th December.\r\n\r\n(M546)\r\n\r\nOn the 16th Cromwell was solemnly installed as Lord Protector, the lord\r\nmayor, the aldermen and the Recorder being invited to be present, and in\r\ndue course his new title was proclaimed in the city.(1075) The lord mayor,\r\nThomas Vyner, happening to be a goldsmith, the Council of State\r\ncommissioned him to supply two services of plate for the use of the \"Lord\r\nProtector and his lady.\"(1076)\r\n\r\n(M547)\r\n\r\nHaving recognised the new order of things and caused the Lord Protector to\r\nbe proclaimed at the Old Exchange and other places in the city,(1077) the\r\nCommon Council proceeded to ask him to a banquet to be given in his honour\r\nat Grocers’ Hall.(1078) The invitation was accepted, and the dinner took\r\nplace on the 8th February, 1654. The entertainment was given in right\r\nroyal style, the mayor and his brother aldermen riding out in state to\r\nmeet his Highness, who exercised the privilege of his new position by\r\nknighting the chief magistrate of the city on his departure.(1079)\r\n\r\n(M548)\r\n\r\nIn July (1654) when there was some talk of sending the city’s Recorder,\r\nWilliam Steele, to Ireland on affairs of State, the Common Council\r\naddressed a petition to the Lord Protector praying him not to deprive the\r\ncity of the services of so excellent an officer, and one who was likely to\r\nprove particularly useful both to the city and the whole Commonwealth in\r\nthe forthcoming parliament,(1080) the first parliament under the\r\nProtectorate and one of the very few parliaments to which the city sent as\r\nmany as six burgesses.(1081)\r\n\r\n(M549)\r\n\r\nThis parliament, like its predecessor, was of short duration, lasting\r\nlittle more than five months. One other parliament and no more was\r\nsummoned by Cromwell (17 Sept., 1656). It was before this parliament that\r\nAlderman Sir Christopher Pack (the only member for the city, so far as we\r\nhave any authentic record), brought forward (23 Feb., 1657) his famous\r\n\"remonstrance,\" desiring the Protector to assume the kingly dignity and to\r\nrestore the House of Lords. The question whether the \"remonstrance\" should\r\nbe read was answered in the affirmative by a majority of nearly 100 after\r\nsome hours’ debate.(1082) Before it was taken into consideration a day was\r\nappointed for prayer and fasting and to seek directions from the\r\nLord.(1083) The proposal was particularly obnoxious to the army, and\r\nColonel Pride had no difficulty in obtaining a large number of signatures\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nAfter many days’ debate, in the course of which the title of the\r\n\"remonstrance\" was changed to that of \"petition and advice,\"(1084) the\r\ndocument received the assent of the Commons, and on the 31st March a copy\r\nof it engrossed on vellum was presented to the Protector at Whitehall in\r\nthe presence of the whole House. Its main feature was the creation of a\r\nsecond House, the members of which were to enjoy their seats for life and\r\nexercise some of the functions of the former House of Lords. Cromwell was\r\nasked to assume the title of king with the right of naming his own\r\nsuccessor. The kingship after considerable hesitation he declined (8 May):\r\n\"I cannot undertake this government with the title of king. And that is\r\nmine answer to this great and weighty business.\"(1085) The rest of the\r\nterms he accepted, and on the 28th June he was again installed as Lord\r\nProtector in the presence of the mayor and aldermen, the mayor to the left\r\nof the Protector bearing the civic sword, with the Earl of Warwick to the\r\nright bearing the sword of state.(1086) On the 1st July public\r\nproclamation was made in the city with great solemnity.(1087)\r\n\r\n(M550)\r\n\r\nIn due course writs were issued to more than sixty persons—many of them\r\nmembers of the House of Commons, whilst others were men of the lower\r\norders, Puritan officers or parliamentary supporters of Cromwell—to form a\r\nnew House, a \"Peerage of fact,\" not of descent.(1088) Among them was Glyn,\r\nthe city’s late Recorder, now a chief justice; two city aldermen, viz.,\r\nChristopher Pack, the prime mover in the restoration of the second House,\r\nand Robert Tichborne, who, in honour of his promotion, it may be,\r\npresented in the following year a silver bason and ewer weighing 110 ozs.\r\nto the City for the use of the lord mayor and his successors.(1089)\r\nColonels Pride and Skippon, soldiers of fortune who had done good service\r\nboth in parliament and on the field, also found seats among Cromwell’s new\r\npeers, as also did John Hewson, erstwhile a shoemaker and still a member\r\nof the Cordwainers’ Company, which honoured him with a banquet at which\r\nspecial dishes, we read, were provided for \"my lord Hewson.\"\r\n\r\n(M551)\r\n\r\nThe new House was not a success. It soon began to give itself the airs of\r\nthe hereditary House of Lords and fell foul of the Commons. Cromwell saw\r\nno other course open but to dissolve his second Protectorate Parliament,\r\nwhich he did on the 4th February (1658).\r\n\r\n(M552)\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 12th March (1658), the civic authorities were sent for to\r\nWhitehall, where they were informed by Cromwell that Charles meditated an\r\ninvasion, and that Ormond had recently been engaged in enlisting support\r\nfor the royalist cause in and about the city. They were asked to put the\r\ncity into a state of readiness for the suppression of tumult and disorder\r\nif any should arise, and to place the militia in trustworthy hands.(1090)\r\nThe warning came just in time, for the Common Council had that very day\r\ngiven orders for the sale of broken carriages, guns and other war material\r\nstored at Gresham College, the Leadenhall and in the Guildhall Chapel, and\r\nfor the proceeds to be paid into the Chamber.(1091) On the 15th the Common\r\nCouncil appointed a committee to draw up a representation or petition\r\nexpressing the City’s thanks to the Protector for the favour thus shown to\r\nthem.(1092) On the 16th the document was presented to the court for\r\napproval, and on the following day carried by a deputation to Cromwell.\r\nIts terms were very flattering. After alluding to the blessings which had\r\naccompanied the Protector’s government and the recent news that \"the old\r\nrestless enemy\" was preparing to execute his wrath against God, his\r\nhighness and the nation, the citizens concluded by assuring him that his\r\nenemies would be considered the City’s enemies and his friends its\r\nfriends.(1093) The deputation was instructed by the Common Council to\r\ndisavow to Cromwell a certain petition which had been addressed to him\r\npurporting to come from \"divers citizens and inhabitants in and about the\r\ncity of London,\" and to humbly desire his highness not to look upon any\r\npetition as the petition of the city of London except such as came from\r\nthe Common Council in the name of \"the mayor, aldermen and commons of the\r\ncity of London in Common Council assembled.\"(1094)\r\n\r\n(M553)\r\n\r\nSo pleased was Cromwell with the City at this critical time that he\r\nconferred the honour of knighthood upon the lord mayor (Richard Chiverton)\r\nand upon John Ireton, a brother of Henry Ireton, his own son-in-law and\r\nfellow campaigner, now deceased.(1095)\r\n\r\n(M554)\r\n\r\nThanks to the Protector’s caution and advice a royalist _émeute_ in the\r\ncity, in which Dr. Hewet, a preacher at St. Gregory’s by St. Paul’s, was\r\nimplicated, and for which he and Sir Henry Slingsby lost their heads, was\r\nprevented, the ringleaders being arrested on the eve of the outbreak. It\r\nwas remarked at the time that the apprentices engaged in this rising were\r\nfor the most part \"sons of cavaliers, or else such debauched fellows that\r\ntheir masters could not rule or govern them.\"(1096) On the 6th July the\r\nmayor, aldermen and sheriffs, with the city’s Recorder, Sir Lisleborne\r\nLong, waited on the Lord Protector to congratulate him upon \"the\r\ndeliverance of his person, the city and the whole nation\" from the dangers\r\nof the late conspiracy.(1097)\r\n\r\n(M555)\r\n\r\nCromwell’s days were fast drawing to a close, although scarce sixty years\r\nof age. The death of his favourite daughter in August of this year cast a\r\ngloom over his mind and affected his health, and within less than a month\r\nhe followed her, dying on the 3rd September—his \"fortunate day,\" as he\r\ncalled it—the day of Dunbar and of Worcester. The lord mayor and city\r\nofficers were allowed each nine yards of mourning cloth, and eighty other\r\npersons of the city four yards each, as on the demise of a\r\nsovereign.(1098) On the 4th Richard Cromwell was proclaimed in succession\r\nto his father at Westminster and in the city, four heralds attending the\r\nmayor on that occasion.(1099)\r\n\r\n(M556)\r\n\r\nAfter a brief trial of a new parliament (29 Jan.-22 April, 1659) the Rump\r\nwas restored and its restoration duly proclaimed in the city.(1100) The\r\ncitizens affected to see a special interposition of Providence in the new\r\norder of affairs and lost no time in preparing a petition for the\r\npreservation of the privileges and estates as well of corporations as of\r\nindividuals, for the speedier despatch of business in the courts of law\r\nand equity, for greater liberty of religious worship, for protection of\r\nuniversities and schools in their work of education, and for relief from\r\nexcessive taxation.(1101) No long time elapsed before the old jealous feud\r\nbetween parliament and the army was renewed by the former resolving that\r\nall commissions should be received from the Speaker of the House. One of\r\nthe first desires of the House was to settle the trained bands of\r\nLondon,(1102) for upon the goodwill of the militia of London and its\r\nneighbourhood much depended. But although the citizens were zealous in\r\ndisplaying their loyalty to the government,(1103) they had no mind that\r\nthe services of their trained bands or of cavalry raised in the city\r\nshould be employed beyond the city’s walls, or that they should be placed\r\nunder the command of any but \"persons of quality, freemen and inhabitants\r\nof the city.\"(1104)\r\n\r\n(M557)\r\n\r\nDissension between parliament and the army was for a time hushed by the\r\nthreat of a common danger. On the 9th August it was reported to the House\r\nthat the lord mayor had discovered the existence of a party in the city in\r\nfavour of the rising which had recently occurred in Cheshire with the view\r\nof bringing in Prince Charles.(1105) The mayor, aldermen and Common\r\nCouncil were thereupon ordered to attend the Council of State at Whitehall\r\non the following afternoon, when they were formally thanked for the\r\nsupport they had given to parliament and encouraged to continue in the\r\nsame course.(1106)\r\n\r\n(M558) (M559)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the danger was over the House thought fit to run the\r\nrisk of alienating the favour of the City by an attempt to force the\r\nre-election of John Ireton as mayor for the coming year upon the unwilling\r\ncitizens. On the 2nd September the House resolved that \"John Ireton\" [thus\r\nignoring his knighthood], then lord mayor of the city of London, should\r\ncontinue to execute the office of lord mayor for the year ensuing, and\r\nordered \"that it be recommended to the city of London to see the same done\r\naccordingly.\"(1107) The Common Council being in no mood to comply with\r\nsuch request drew up a long petition to parliament,(1108) in which the\r\ngovernment of the city was shown to depend upon \"two strong supports,\"\r\nviz., the customs of the city and its charters, confirmed as they had been\r\nby divers Acts of Parliament; that by virtue of these charters and customs\r\nthe mayor was chosen by the citizens, that he remained in office for no\r\nmore than one year, and was presented to the supreme power of the nation\r\nfor approbation. The petition went on to remind the House how on various\r\noccasions, and notably on the 13th January, 1644, and the 6th and 18th May\r\nof the same year, parliament had formally acknowledged the constant\r\naffection and assistance it had received from the city, and concluded by\r\npraying the House to lay no restraint upon the free election of their\r\nmayor by the citizens nor infringe the ancient customs and charters of the\r\ncity, a breach of which \"would exceedingly hazard, if not totally destroy,\r\nthe peace, good order and happiness of the most ancient and well governed\r\ncity\" in the nation, if not in the whole world.\r\n\r\n(M560)\r\n\r\nThe House taking this petition into consideration on the 28th\r\nSeptember—the day preceding that on which the election was to take\r\nplace—resolved by thirty-eight votes to thirteen \"that the city of London\r\nbe left at liberty to make choice of their mayor according to their\r\ncharter, notwithstanding the previous vote of the House of the 2nd\r\nSeptember instant.\"(1109)  The citizens thereupon showed their\r\nindependence by electing Thomas Aleyne.\r\n\r\n(M561)\r\n\r\nA good understanding or \"correspondence\" between parliament and the city\r\nhaving thus been arrived at, the Common Council resolved to ask the House\r\nto a dinner at Grocers’ Hall to commemorate Lambert’s defeat of the\r\nroyalists. The invitation was accepted, and Thursday, the 6th October,\r\nnamed as the day on which the House would be prepared to go to the city to\r\nhear a sermon at Christchurch, Newgate, and afterwards dine with the\r\nmunicipal authorities.(1110)\r\n\r\n(M562)\r\n\r\nOn that day week (13th October) the House suffered another indignity at\r\nthe hands of the army. No sooner had Lambert defeated the royalist\r\ninsurgents in Cheshire than he and his fellow officers made extraordinary\r\ndemands of parliament. When these were refused they betook themselves to\r\nbrute force and sent troops to shut out members from the House.(1111) So\r\narbitrary a proceeding was distasteful to the citizens of London as well\r\nas to the nation at large.\r\n\r\n(M563)\r\n\r\nWhen lord mayor’s day came round and Thomas Aleyne was to enter upon his\r\nyear of office there was some apprehension in the minds of Fleetwood and\r\nthe Council of Officers, who were now supreme, lest the day should be made\r\nan opportunity for display of popular feeling in favour of parliament. It\r\nwas suggested, therefore, to the Court of Aldermen by Fleetwood that it\r\nmight be well to omit the usual shows and attendance of the companies on\r\nthat day. The court, however, thought otherwise, and directed a deputation\r\nto wait upon his excellency and acquaint him with the preparations that\r\nhad already been made, and with the disappointment which the citizens\r\nwould feel if they had to forego the customary solemnities, which could be\r\ncarried out, in the opinion of the court, without any risk of\r\ndisturbance.(1112)\r\n\r\n(M564)\r\n\r\nMonk, who was in Scotland, disapproved of the action of Lambert and his\r\nfellow officers, and prepared to march southward for the purpose (he said)\r\nof vindicating the rights of parliament. Whether he had any ulterior\r\nmotive in view at the time is not known. Every effort was made by the\r\nofficers of Lambert’s army to secure the support of the City before Monk’s\r\narrival. On the 4th November and again on the 8th, Fleetwood, Whitelock\r\nand others conferred with the civic authorities. On the latter occasion\r\nWhitelock did not hesitate to declare that Monk’s real design was the\r\nking’s restoration at the risk of a civil war. \"I shewed the danger of it\r\nto the city and nation and counselled them to provide for their own\r\nsafety, and to join for the safety of the whole nation and for\r\npreservation of the peace.\" The Common Council expressed their thanks, and\r\nresolved to follow the advice thus given.(1113)\r\n\r\n(M565)\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd November the Common Council received a letter from Monk, which\r\nWhitelock describes as \"not relished well by them.\"(1114) The letter is\r\nnot mentioned in the minutes of the court held on that day, which are\r\nconfined to an order for the repair of the wall of Richmond Park and to\r\nthe appointment of a day (2 Dec.) for a solemn humiliation with fasting\r\nand prayer, that God might bring them through all their \"fears, troubles\r\nand darkness unto true rest, peace and settlement.\"(1115)\r\n\r\n(M566)\r\n\r\nWhilst matters were yet in a state of suspense the apprentices of the city\r\nagain took the lead and presented (5 Dec.) a petition to the Common\r\nCouncil on the subject of \"how the peace of this city may be preserved.\"\r\nTheir petition was referred to a committee for consideration,(1116) but\r\nthe apprentices brooked no delay. Out into the street they ran, in spite\r\nof all precautions to keep them indoors, crying out for a \"free\r\nparliament.\" Amid the confusion Hewson appeared on the scene with a\r\nregiment of soldiers, and there was some little bloodshed, two men being\r\nkilled. This brought the army into greater disrepute than ever, and the\r\ncry became general that \"it was only kept on foot for the murder of\r\ncitizens.\" The next day (6 Dec.) the Court of Aldermen sent a deputation\r\nto the Committee of Safety to excuse the recent outbreak and to disavow\r\nany complicity in it.(1117) The Committee desired to know particulars as\r\nto how the men came by their death, and to understand how far the Court of\r\nAldermen would be responsible for the peace of the city. The Committee was\r\ntold in reply that the recent deaths were under the consideration of the\r\ncoroner, and that as to the steps about to be taken for the preservation\r\nof the peace of the city, further information would shortly be\r\ngiven.(1118)\r\n\r\n(M567)\r\n\r\nOn the 8th December a Court of Aldermen sat and appointed a committee to\r\nconfer with Fleetwood for preserving the peace and safety of the city and\r\n\"for a right understanding between the city and army.\" He was to be\r\ndesired in the meantime to keep his soldiers within barracks whilst the\r\ncourt of Common Council was sitting, unless the mayor or sheriffs\r\nexpressed a wish to the contrary, and to cause the removal of certain\r\n\"granadoes\" recently stored at Gresham College and elsewhere in the city,\r\nwhich had caused strange apprehensions among the inhabitants. A petition\r\nto the Common Council for a parliament as in 1642 was unfavourably\r\nreceived, and handed back to the petitioners with a request to them not to\r\nprint it.(1119) Anxious as the citizens were to get rid of the army’s\r\nammunition stored in the city, they were not so anxious to part with their\r\nown little stock of gunpowder, and hesitated to lodge it in the Tower as\r\nrequested, lest it should be some day used against themselves. The City\r\nRemembrancer was instructed (17 Dec.) to see Fleetwood on the matter, and\r\nto represent to him the feeling of the inhabitants, that order might be\r\ntaken for securing public peace and quiet.(1120)\r\n\r\n(M568)\r\n\r\nBy the 19th matters were accommodated between Fleetwood and the City. A\r\nparliament was to be summoned which should be free from military influence\r\nor interference. The Common Council, on hearing of the success of the\r\ncommittee appointed to confer with Fleetwood, were so satisfied with the\r\nmanner in which it had carried out its duties that they authorised it to\r\ncontinue to confer with his lordship from time to time as it should see\r\ncause for prevention of all misunderstandings between the city and the\r\narmy.(1121) The action of the mayor, the common council and the committee\r\nin the matter was much canvassed, however, by a certain section of the\r\ncommunity, and they were accused of betraying the rights and liberties of\r\nthe city. A \"declaration\" was therefore drawn up in vindication of their\r\nconduct.(1122)\r\n\r\n(M569)\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd a fresh committee was appointed to consult for the peace and\r\nsafety of the city as well as to consider what answers should be sent to\r\nMonk, to the officers at Portsmouth and to Lawson, who was in command of a\r\nsquadron in the Thames, all of whom were opposed to the army in London and\r\nin favour of a parliament.\r\n\r\n(M570)\r\n\r\nNo time was lost; on the following day (23 Dec.) the committee reported to\r\nthe Common Council recommending, among other things, that six regiments of\r\ntrained bands should be at once called out and placed under the command of\r\nofficers, whose commissions should be under the common seal of the city;\r\nthat commissioners should be appointed to confer with Haslerigg, Morley,\r\nWalton and Vice-Admiral Lawson touching the safety of the city and the\r\npeace and settlement of the nation, and \"in due time\" to give an answer to\r\nGeneral Monk’s letter; and that the commissioners should be authorised to\r\npropound the convening of a free parliament according to the late\r\n\"declaration\" of the court. These recommendations being approved,\r\ncommissioners were there and then appointed, and instructions drawn up for\r\ntheir guidance.(1123)\r\n\r\n(M571)\r\n\r\nThe next day (Saturday, 24 Dec.) the Common Council was busy nominating\r\nofficers of the trained bands. It also ordered the city’s chains and posts\r\nto be set up in the several precincts, and the gates, portcullises and\r\nposterns to be looked to; but the council afterwards changed their minds\r\non this matter, and the order was countermanded before the court\r\nrose.(1124)\r\n\r\n(M572)\r\n\r\nThe revival of the city’s militia was a welcome sign to the royalists.\r\n\"What does the city?\" wrote secretary Nicholas from Brussels about this\r\ntime. \"We know they talk of setting up a militia of their own, and that\r\nsome of them say, as they helped to drive out the father, they will help\r\nto bring in the son.\"(1125) And again, a few days later, \"The city should\r\nbe made to understand how much their interests are concerned to suppress\r\nthe illegal and boundless authority usurped by the army which cannot be\r\ndone but by force, and by no force so well as that of the city and\r\ncounties adjacent; for if the army shall ... get again to be absolute\r\nmasters in London, no citizen or inhabitant there will be secure of\r\nanything they possess longer than it pleases the soldiery, which will soon\r\nmake the citizens their absolute slaves.\" Once more, \"The city cannot be\r\nsecure,\" he repeats, \"if the army continue their quarter and soldiers\r\nstill among them, nor can any parliament be free whilst awed by an\r\narmy.... Until it [the army] shall be made to obey orders from a power\r\nsuperior to it, there can be no security or peace, either in city or\r\ncountry.\"(1126)\r\n\r\n(M573)\r\n\r\nThe spirit that had moved Haslerigg, Morley, Walton and Lawson at length\r\nmoved the rank and file of the army in London. The soldiers placed\r\nthemselves at the command of their cashiered officers. On the 24th\r\nDecember they marched to Lenthall’s house in Chancery Lane, expressed\r\ntheir sorrow for the past, and promised to stand by parliament for the\r\nfuture. On the 26th the Rump was for the second time restored to\r\npower.(1127)\r\n\r\n(M574) (M575)\r\n\r\nThe citizens had obtained their desire to have once more a parliament, but\r\nthe parliament they got was far from being the free parliament they had\r\nbeen looking for. They wished to take an early opportunity—lest their\r\naction should be misinterpreted—to inform the Rump that the measures they\r\nhad taken for \"settling\" the trained bands had been taken before \"their\r\nhonors came together this last time.\" They desired to explain the reasons\r\nfor undertaking the work, and to show that in so doing the city had only\r\nacted within its rights. A petition was accordingly drawn up on the 28th\r\nDecember, setting forth that disorders in the city had increased \"by the\r\nexorbitant actings of many of those men who at first being appointed by\r\nparliament a Committee of Militia within the city of London for their\r\nsecurity and safety, have since their last interruption acted by a\r\ncommission under the Great Seal of England against the same parliament,\"\r\nand that for the prevention of any disorder that might arise they had\r\nfallen back upon their ancient rights and usages, and had put themselves\r\nin a posture of defence, not for the purpose of acting against parliament,\r\nbut for it. Whilst offering these explanations the City was anxious that\r\nparliament would receive into its House all such members as were still\r\nalive and fill up the places of all who were dead. On the 29th the Common\r\nCouncil resolved that this petition should not be laid before the House\r\nuntil further order.(1128) The commissioners appointed by the City to\r\nconfer with Haslerigg, Morley and Walton at Portsmouth had returned, and\r\ntheir report made to the Common Council on that day may have given rise to\r\nthe postponement.\r\n\r\n(M576)\r\n\r\nMonk’s letter to the City, sent in November, had all this time remained\r\nunanswered. At last (29 Dec.) a reply was drawn up, and, after receiving\r\nthe approval of the Common Council, was despatched to the general by the\r\nhands of the City Swordbearer.(1129)\r\n\r\n(M577)\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the year a deputation from the House, including\r\nLenthall, Haslerigg, Morley and others, waited upon the Court of Aldermen\r\nto confer with them about the safety of the city. The erection of the city\r\nposts and chains, which apparently had been proceeded with, and the\r\ncalling out of the trained bands troubled parliament. By the 2nd January\r\nHaslerigg was able to satisfy parliament on the first head. It was\r\ncontrary (he said) to the mind of the lord mayor, aldermen and Common\r\nCouncil to have any posts or chains set up, and those that were set up\r\nshould be taken down.(1130) Two days later (4 Jan.) the Common Council\r\nordered the settlement of the trained bands to be proceeded with, and\r\nnominated a committee to lay before parliament the grounds and reasons for\r\nso doing, the committee being instructed to again press for a full and\r\nfree parliament.(1131) The attitude of the City towards the restored Rump\r\nwas keenly watched by royalists abroad. \"Let me know certainly the\r\nLondoners’ intentions about the Rump,\" wrote secretary Nicholas, \"and\r\nsettling their own militia, and also the proceedings of Monk and Lambert,\r\nand how each of them approves the restoring of the Rump.\"(1132)\r\n\r\n(M578)\r\n\r\nThe City’s anxiety for a return of a full and free parliament in the place\r\nof the Rump was occasioned in some degree by the fact that in the existing\r\nHouse they had but a single representative, viz., Alderman Atkin, and\r\nwithout due representation the citizens refused to be subjected to\r\ntaxation. \"They were resolved,\" Pepys notes in his diary (13 Jan.), \"to\r\nmake no more applications to the parliament, nor to pay any money, unless\r\nthe secluded members be brought in or a free parliament chosen.\"\r\n\r\n(M579) (M580)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Lambert, who had set out for the north of England with the\r\nintention of stopping Monk’s passage from Scotland, had been recalled, and\r\nby the middle of January Monk and his army were well on their way to\r\nLondon. On the 6th January he had despatched a letter(1133) to the Common\r\nCouncil by the hands of the City Swordbearer, who having handed to the\r\ngeneral the city’s late missive, was about to return.(1134) As Monk\r\napproached London Alderman Fowke and two other commissioners were ordered\r\n(19 Jan.) to go out to meet him and thank him for his second letter, and\r\nfor his cheerful concurrence with the declaration of the Common Council,\r\nand to desire the continuance of a good understanding between his\r\nexcellency and the court for the settlement of the nation and peace of the\r\ncity. By the 30th they had returned and were able to report to the Common\r\nCouncil the result of their interview.(1135) The nature of their report\r\nhas not been recorded.\r\n\r\n(M581) (M582)\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid as much as possible the appearance of entering London as\r\na conqueror, Monk brought with him no more than 5,000 men, a force\r\nconsiderably less than that which was quartered in London and Westminster.\r\nHaving reached St. Albans, he wrote to the Speaker asking that five of the\r\nregiments in the capital might be removed to a distance before his arrival\r\nlest his troops should become disaffected by intercourse with those who\r\nhad been so recently engaged in rebellion. The House acquiesced and gave\r\norders to that effect, but the soldiers refused to leave their quarters,\r\nswearing that they would not go without their money, and threatening if\r\ntheir pay was not received to \"go where they might have it, and that was\r\nthe city.\"(1136) A sum of money having been hastily raised to satisfy\r\ntheir demands, they consented to march out, and the next morning (3 Feb.)\r\nMonk entered at the head of his force—\"in very good plight and stout\r\nofficers\"—and proceeded to the quarters assigned to him at Whitehall\r\nrecently occupied by Bradshaw.(1137)\r\n\r\n(M583)\r\n\r\nMonk was anxious to feel the pulse of the City before committing himself\r\nto any definite policy. He had not long to wait before he was assured of\r\nits favour. On the 8th February the Common Council agreed to send a\r\ndeputation to the general to congratulate him upon his coming to London\r\nand to thank him for his courtesy to the City’s commissioners recently\r\ndespatched to him, as well as to express a hope that the good\r\nunderstanding which had prevailed between his excellency and the City\r\nmight continue.(1138)\r\n\r\n(M584)\r\n\r\nThe friendly attitude of the City towards Monk, and its recent hostile\r\nattitude towards parliament—some of the Common Council, we are told, had\r\nbeen \"very high\" at the last court, and refused to pay taxes until the\r\nHouse should be filled up(1139)—was so marked that the Rump determined\r\nupon dissolving the Common Council, although it commended the \"discreet\r\ncarriage\" of the lord mayor in conducting the business of the court.(1140)\r\nNot content with this the House went further, and ordered troops to be\r\nquartered in the city \"for reducing the city to the obedience of the\r\nparliament.\" The city’s gates and portcullises, moreover, were to be\r\nremoved, and eleven citizens, including an alderman, were ordered into\r\ncustody.(1141)\r\n\r\n(M585)\r\n\r\nThe unenviable task of seeing these orders executed was, by a clever\r\nstroke of policy, committed to Monk himself. There was no alternative open\r\nto him but to obey, and to carry out the orders of parliament with as\r\nlittle friction to the citizens as was possible. No sooner had he taken up\r\nhis residence in the city for this purpose than he was asked by the mayor\r\nto delay removing the city’s gates until the matter should be communicated\r\nto the Court of Aldermen.\r\n\r\n(M586)\r\n\r\nA special court having been summoned Monk attended in person (10 Feb.) and\r\ninformed the members of the commands that had been laid upon him by\r\nparliament touching the city’s gates and portcullises. Being told that the\r\nexecution of such commands would be \"of very ill consequence both to\r\nparliament and the city\" the general could only reply that the commands of\r\nthe House were so positive that he could only hold his hand on one\r\ncondition, and that was that the city should acknowledge the Rump that so\r\nhe might have ground for writing to and mediating with the House. The\r\ncourt was allowed to consider the matter whilst Monk withdrew. Upon his\r\nreturn he was informed that the Court of Aldermen could not speak on\r\nbehalf of the whole body of citizens, \"and that the Common Council being\r\nnow disabled to meet, there was none in capacity to do it.\" But, said his\r\nexcellency, the Court of Aldermen might declare their own minds? Again\r\nMonk withdrew, only to be told, however, on his return that the court was\r\nof opinion that their doing so \"would not at this time be a service either\r\nto the parliament or city.\"(1142)\r\n\r\n(M587)\r\n\r\nThe next day (11 Feb.) the Court of Aldermen again met. Monk, too, was\r\nthere. He had just despatched a letter to the Speaker of the House\r\ncomplaining of the invidious work he and his soldiers had been set to do—a\r\nwork which served only to bring them into discredit with the city—and\r\nperemptorily demanding that every seat in the House should be filled up by\r\nthe following Friday (17 Feb.) as a preliminary to the calling together of\r\na new parliament. When the aldermen heard of this letter they were\r\ndelighted, and ready to accede to anything Monk might suggest. He proposed\r\nquartering troops in the city \"for a few days.\" The aldermen raised no\r\nobjection, but asked his excellency to utilise as far as possible the inns\r\nand public victualling houses, \"so as may be least offence to the\r\ncitizens.\"(1143) They even displayed a readiness to give up their own\r\nhouses to the use of the general and his officers, and promised that his\r\nsoldiers should lack nothing.(1144) On his quitting the court such a shout\r\nwas raised of \"God bless your excellency\" as had been seldom heard.\r\nBonfires were lighted that evening from Cheapside to Temple Bar, bells\r\nwere set ringing, and rumps carried in mock procession and solemnly\r\nroasted in token of the approaching dissolution of parliament. So great\r\nwas the hospitality offered to the soldiers that most of them got\r\ngloriously drunk.(1145)\r\n\r\n(M588)\r\n\r\nThe next day being Sunday (12 Feb.) Monk, whose wife had joined him in his\r\nlodgings in the city, attended morning service at St. Paul’s, and in the\r\nafternoon went to a church in Broad Street, probably that of St. Peter le\r\nPoor, in the neighbourhood of his lodgings.(1146)\r\n\r\n(M589)\r\n\r\nOn Monday (13 Feb.) he held a conference with the mayor and aldermen at\r\nDrapers’ Hall, a stone’s throw from where he lived, with reference to the\r\npeace and safety of the city. Alderman Atkin, a member of parliament, was\r\nsent for to be informed of \"sundry matters of great danger to the city,\"\r\nof which information had reached the ears of the Court of Aldermen, and\r\nwhich he was to communicate to the House. But particulars are not\r\nrecorded.(1147)\r\n\r\n(M590)\r\n\r\nThe Council of State were far from being pleased with Monk for taking up\r\nhis quarters in the city, and repeatedly urged him to leave the city for\r\nWhitehall, where they could keep a better watch on his movements. They\r\nparticularly desired his company at Whitehall on Tuesday morning for the\r\npurpose (they said) of consulting him on matters relating to public\r\nsafety, and in order that they might have an opportunity of communicating\r\nto him the recent proceedings of parliament.(1148)\r\n\r\n(M591)\r\n\r\nMonk was in no hurry to quit the city. On Wednesday (15 Feb.) he sent for\r\nAlderman Fowke to say that he purposed marching out of the city with his\r\nforces on the following afternoon, but that in so doing he had no\r\nintention of receding from his promise to secure the safety of the city.\r\nHe would also endeavour to bring about a right understanding between\r\nparliament and the city. Fowke having reported this to the Court of\r\nAldermen there was great alarm, and a deputation was despatched, with\r\nFowke at its head, to beg the general to let his soldiers remain in the\r\ncity \"if it may consist with his trust.\" Word was brought next day to the\r\ncourt that in the event of his excellency quitting the city he would leave\r\nbehind two regiments for its safety, and that if the court would give him\r\nthe names of persons fit to be officers he would endeavour to get two\r\nregiments of their own appointed by parliament.(1149)\r\n\r\n(M592)\r\n\r\nInstead of quitting the city Monk only changed his quarters to the house\r\nof William Wale, alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, whither he\r\ncaused his goods to be removed from Whitehall, as to a more or less\r\npermanent residence.(1150) There he remained, holding frequent interviews\r\nwith the leading citizens and preparing to carry into effect the project\r\nof restoring the king.(1151)\r\n\r\n(M593)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile parliament had been busy completing the bill for the\r\nqualifications of electors and candidates for the new parliament, and on\r\nthe day fixed (17 Feb.) by Monk writs were ready to be issued. According\r\nto the qualifications passed by the House, no one could be elected a\r\nmember of the forthcoming parliament unless pledged to support a\r\nrepublican form of government. As this meant the exclusion of the members\r\nshut out by Pride’s Purge in 1648 it gave rise to much dissatisfaction,\r\nand Monk was appealed to. A deputation of the sitting members met a\r\ndeputation of the excluded members at Monk’s new quarters, when it was\r\ndecided that the Presbyterian members shut out by Pride’s Purge should\r\nagain be allowed to take their seats. Four days later (21 Feb.) they\r\nattended parliament at Monk’s invitation and were admitted without\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nThe day passed off without any disturbance, although it was feared that\r\nthe \"secluded\" members might attempt to force their way into parliament.\r\nIt was also feared that if such an attempt were made it would be backed up\r\nby some inhabitants of the city. The council had therefore asked Monk to\r\ntake precautions for securing the freedom of parliament as well as\r\nmaintaining peace within the city.(1152)\r\n\r\n(M594)\r\n\r\nThe recent order of parliament dissolving the Common Council of the city\r\nwas declared null and void, the municipal authorities were allowed to set\r\nup the city’s gates and portcullises again, and the imprisoned citizens\r\nwere liberated.(1153) That night was a joyous one in the city. Bells were\r\nrung and bonfires were lighted, so that the sky was ablaze with\r\nilluminations, \"a most pleasant sight to see.\"(1154)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th February—a day set apart for public thanksgiving—Monk was\r\ninvited to an entertainment at Grocers’ Hall in honour of the restoration\r\nof a full parliament and of the Common Council of the city; but party\r\nspirit was so rife that it became necessary to warn the general against\r\nreceiving anything that he might hear \"as the sense of the city.\"(1155)\r\nBonfires were forbidden to be lighted in the city that night by order of\r\nthe Council of State, lest some discontented spirits might seize the\r\nopportunity to raise a disturbance.(1156)\r\n\r\n(M595)\r\n\r\nThe day that the Common Council re-assembled (22 Feb.) it received a\r\ndeputation from the restored House asking for a loan. With little\r\nhesitation the court voted a sum of £60,000 on the security of the monthly\r\nassessments. It was left to the aldermen, deputies and common councilmen\r\nof the wards to raise the money by subscription, and they were further\r\ninstructed to take the best course they could for raising a sum of\r\n£100,000 upon the same account.(1157) It was subsequently (1 March)\r\narranged that the sum of £27,000 should be advanced upon security of the\r\nsix months’ assessment, and in case the same should not be fully collected\r\nout of the assessment, the deficit, as well as the cost of repairing and\r\nsetting up the gates, portcullises, etc., should be secured by Act of\r\nParliament.(1158)\r\n\r\n(M596)\r\n\r\nThe House acceded to the City’s request that its militia might be placed\r\nin the hands of commissioners of its own choice. Monk himself was\r\nnominated by the Common Council (3 March) Sergeant-Major-General of the\r\ncity’s forces, a post which he signified his willingness to accept.(1159)\r\nThe sooner the militia was settled the sooner would the city be rid of\r\nMonk’s soldiers, of whose excesses the Common Council had had recent cause\r\nto complain.(1160) Armed once more with parliamentary powers, the\r\ncommissioners for the militia of the city prepared to raise six regiments\r\nof auxiliaries and some cavalry, as well as a month’s tax at the rate of\r\n£35,000 a month over England for their maintenance or \"trophies.\"(1161)\r\n\r\n(M597)\r\n\r\nHaving settled the militia of the kingdom as well as that of London,\r\nparliament—the Long Parliament, which during its actual or nominal\r\nexistence for nearly twenty years had experienced every vicissitude of\r\nfortune—was at length dissolved (16 March) by its own act, and writs were\r\nissued for a fresh parliament to meet on the 25th April.(1162) The new\r\nparliament was known as the Convention Parliament on account of its\r\nmembers having been elected without the king’s writs.\r\n\r\n(M598)\r\n\r\nTen days after the dissolution of the Long Parliament there came to the\r\nCommon Council of the city a deputation from the Council of State, in\r\nwhose hands the sole government of the kingdom then lay, with a proposal\r\nto borrow the sum of half a million of money (£500,000) upon the security\r\nof a moiety of the excise. The court, after deliberation, agreed (2 April)\r\nto lend a sum of money (amount not specified) to the Council of State upon\r\nsecurity of the moiety of the excise \"and the honour of the said Council\r\nof State,\" and ordered that subscriptions should at once be set on foot in\r\nthe several wards.(1163)\r\n\r\n(M599)\r\n\r\nScarcely had the House broken up before people began to talk freely of the\r\nking and his probable restoration, a subject on which they had hitherto\r\ndared only to speak in a whisper. So bold indeed did they become that on\r\nthe very day of the dissolution a man came with a ladder to the\r\nExchange—not \"Royal,\" but \"Great\" Exchange—in the city and obliterated\r\nwith a brush the inscription, _Exit Tyrannus Regum Ultimus_, which had\r\nbeen set up in August, 1650, near the site of the late king’s statue,\r\ndestroyed by order of the then Council of State, as already narrated.\r\nBefore the end of the month another statue was in course of making to take\r\nthe place of the one that had been thus destroyed.(1164) As time went on,\r\nand Monk’s design to bring in Charles became more apparent, the citizens\r\ngrew yet bolder. The Skinners’ Company went so far as to set up again the\r\nroyal arms in their hall on the occasion of an entertainment given to Monk\r\nhimself.(1165)\r\n\r\n(M600)\r\n\r\nTowards the close of April, when it was evident that the king’s\r\nrestoration was a mere question of time, the Common Council showed an\r\nanxiety to place on record an account of the attitude taken up by the\r\nCity, and to vindicate its action throughout the late troublous times. It\r\nappointed (26 April) a committee \"to peruse the records of this court and\r\nreport what of them are fit to be considered of, and their opinions\r\nthereupon; and also to prepare a narrative for the vindication of this\r\ncourt and city touching the same.\" The committee at once set to work, and\r\nin four days were ready with a draft of \"a declaration and vindication of\r\nthe lord mayor, aldermen and commons of the city of London in Common\r\nCouncil assembled,\" which received the approval of the court (30 April),\r\nand a printed copy of which was ordered to be sent to every member of\r\nparliament and Council of State.(1166)\r\n\r\nAfter expressions of satisfaction at the thought of an end having been put\r\nto the distractions of the kingdom by General Monk, and at the hopeful\r\nprospect of a return to the old form of government by king, lords and\r\ncommons, under which the country had so long prospered at home and been\r\nrespected abroad, this declaration proceeded to disavow the various Acts\r\nof the Common Council as established in 1648, when, \"in the general deluge\r\nof disorder introduced upon these kingdoms\" in that year, the government\r\nof the city passed into the hands of \"men of loose and dangerous\r\nprinciples,\" who proceeded to pass Acts \"tending to the murder of the late\r\nking and total extinguishment of kingly government,\" and who by no means\r\nwere a fair representation of the city. It set forth various proceedings\r\nof the Common Council in connection with parliament and the city’s\r\nEngagement to guarantee the personal safety of the late king from the 22nd\r\nJune, 1648, down to the 13th January, 1649, when the lord mayor Reynardson\r\nwas constrained to leave the council. The terms of this Engagement the\r\nCity was prepared to carry out, \"but it pleased Almighty God to permit\r\ntheir good intentions and endeavours to be frustrated by the destructive\r\ncounsels and actings of those who had designed to build upp their dominion\r\nand fortunes on the ruin of the king and kingdom.\" The House of Lords was\r\ndissolved, and all the best members excluded from the House of Commons. By\r\n\"pretended ordinances\" of parliament, all those worthy citizens who,\r\naccording to their allegiance and covenant, had engaged to procure and\r\nsecure a personal treaty with the king, were rendered incapable to be\r\nelected into the Common Council or any other office of trust in the city.\r\n\r\nWhat could be expected of a body thus emasculated? They declare themselves\r\nunable to find words to express their abhorrence of the proceedings that\r\nhad taken place in the Common Council of the 13th January, 1649, and\r\n\"profess their thankful memory of the noble gallant resolutions of the\r\nthen lord mayor, Alderman Reynardson, and his brethren the aldermen, who\r\nso valiantly resisted the turbulent disorders of that _mechanicke juncto_\r\nduring many hours’ assault and at last prudently retreated and washed\r\ntheir hands from the guilt of those bloody resolves.\" In conclusion they\r\nexpress a hope and trust that since the recovery of the right of free\r\nelection the Common Council had manifested an eagerness to act cordially\r\nand strenuously with parliament in everything tending towards good\r\ngovernment, and that soon, by the aid of the parliament recently convened,\r\nthey would be put under the protection of the first and fundamental\r\ngovernment of hereditary monarchy according to the ancient laws of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n(M601)\r\n\r\nThe City’s declaration and vindication was scarcely printed and published\r\nbefore a letter from Charles himself(1167) was brought to the Common\r\nCouncil by Lord Mordaunt and Sir John Grenville (1 May), in which the\r\nprince expressed a wish that the City should know how little he desired\r\nrevenge and how convinced he was that the peace, happiness and security of\r\nthe kingdom were only to be secured by gaining the hearts and affections\r\nof his subjects. He felt that he could count upon the City to assist him\r\nin re-establishing those fundamental laws upon which the happiness of the\r\ncountry so much depended, and he avowed a \"particular affection\" for his\r\nnative city, the charters of which he was not only ready to renew and\r\nconfirm, but to grant such new favours as might advance its trade, wealth\r\nand honour.\r\n\r\n(M602)\r\n\r\nEnclosed in this letter was a declaration known as the Declaration of\r\nBreda, from the place where Charles had signed it on the 4th April\r\n(o.s.)(1168) It offered a general pardon to all except those specially\r\nexempted by parliament and promised liberty of conscience in matters of\r\nreligion. Charles further expressed his willingness to leave questions of\r\ntitle to estates acquired during the late troublous times to be decided by\r\nparliament. He assured the soldiers of arrears of pay and promised to\r\ncontinue them in his service on the same terms as they then enjoyed.\r\n\r\n(M603)\r\n\r\nThe letter and declaration having been read (1 May), the Common Council\r\nreturned thanks to Charles for his condescension towards the City, and\r\nexpressed their willingness to submit to his majesty’s government, in\r\ntoken of which the arms of the Commonwealth (he was informed) had already\r\nbeen taken down and orders given for those of his majesty to be set up. A\r\ncommittee was appointed to draw up a formal answer in writing for\r\nconveyance to Charles by the same hands that had brought his letter,\r\nprovided parliament would allow the City to return an answer. The late\r\nking’s statue, which had been removed from the Guildhall chapel, was to be\r\nforthwith set up again.(1169)\r\n\r\n(M604)\r\n\r\nCharles having shrewdly thrown upon parliament the burden of naming the\r\nterms on which his restoration was to take place, it became necessary that\r\na parliament should meet forthwith. Another Convention Parliament had\r\naccordingly met on the 25th April. The declaration of Breda reached it on\r\nthe 1st May, and on the following day it sent to borrow £100,000 from the\r\nCity. The Common Council at once took steps for raising the money.(1170)\r\nOne half of this sum was destined for the king’s own use, and sorely he\r\nstood in need of it. Pepys, who had it from an eye-witness, records \"how\r\noverjoyed the king was when Sir J. Grenville brought him some money; so\r\njoyful that he called the Princess Royal and Duke of York to look upon it\r\nas it lay in the portmanteau before it was taken out.\"(1171)\r\n\r\n(M605)\r\n\r\nThe same day (2 May) that the Common Council undertook to raise the loan\r\nfor parliament it voted on its own account a gift of £10,000 to Charles.\r\nIt also voted a sum of £2,000 for expenses in sending a deputation to the\r\nHague; but it was subsequently resolved to divide the sum between the\r\nDukes of York and Gloucester, and that the members of the deputation\r\nshould discharge their own expenses. A further sum of £300 was voted for\r\nLord Mordaunt and Sir John Grenville, the bearers of the king’s letters,\r\nfor the purchase of a ring apiece. The sum of £12,000 was raised among the\r\nlivery companies on the understanding that this was an exceptional\r\noccasion and was not to be drawn into precedent.(1172)\r\n\r\n(M606)\r\n\r\nBesides returning an answer by the hands of the king’s messengers, the\r\nCommon Council appointed sixteen commissioners to wait upon the king at\r\nthe Hague with the City’s formal answer.(1173) By the 28th May the\r\ncommissioners returned and reported the success of their expedition to the\r\nCommon Council. They had been very graciously received by Charles, who had\r\nconferred knighthood upon those who had not already received that honour.\r\nThe court gave them a hearty vote of thanks for the great pains and\r\ncharges they had been put to.(1174)\r\n\r\n(M607)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Charles had been publicly proclaimed king in the city by\r\nthe lord mayor (8 May), who, in honour of the occasion, had been specially\r\nprovided with a new crimson velvet gown, whilst his Swordbearer in\r\nattendance was scarcely less gorgeous in a damask gown of the finest\r\n\"branch.\"(1175) The Commons of England joining with them, the lord mayor,\r\naldermen and commons of London unanimously acknowledged and proclaimed\r\nthat by inherent right the crown had devolved upon Charles II immediately\r\non the decease of his father as next heir.(1176)\r\n\r\n(M608)\r\n\r\nOn the 25th May Charles landed at Dover, and four days later entered\r\nLondon, being met at St. George’s Fields(1177) by the mayor and aldermen.\r\nThe City’s sword having been offered to the king and returned, Charles\r\nconferred the honour of knighthood upon Thomas Aleyne, the lord mayor, and\r\npartook of refreshment in the lord mayor’s tent, set up for the purpose.\r\nFrom there to Whitehall the journey was one long triumphal procession\r\nthrough streets strewn with flowers and lined with members of the\r\ncompanies in their handsome liveries. Never was there such a restoration,\r\nwrote John Evelyn, since the return of the Jews from the Babylonish\r\ncaptivity.(1178)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M609)\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, the 2nd June (1660), the mayor and aldermen,\r\naccompanied by the Recorder, waited upon the king to congratulate him on\r\nhis return and to restore to him Richmond Park, according to a resolution\r\nof the Common Council.(1179) Speaking on behalf of the City, the Recorder\r\nexpressly declared that it was done by way of restitution and not as a\r\ngift. He assured the king that it was well that the park had been in the\r\nCity’s hands, for they had preserved the wood, vert and game. Not to be\r\noutdone in courtesy the king replied that \"the city of London were still\r\nloading him with their kindness, and that he looked upon the said park to\r\nbe kept for him, and that he accepted it not as restored, but as freely\r\ngiven unto him by the city, and thanked them for the same.\"(1180)\r\n\r\n(M610)\r\n\r\nThe early days of June were busy days for lord mayor Aleyne, to whose\r\nhouse the citizens flocked in order to signify their acceptance of his\r\nmajesty’s offer of pardon.(1181) On the 5th June the mayor himself and\r\nthose aldermen who were not barred by the Statute of Indemnity and\r\nOblivion (12 Charles II, c. 11), subscribed a declaration of pardon,\r\nwhilst members of the Common Council took the oaths of supremacy and\r\nallegiance pursuant to the king’s orders.(1182) Later on the master and\r\nwardens of the livery companies, the presidents of the hospitals, the\r\npresident and governors of the Irish Society, as well as the governors of\r\nthe Merchant Adventurers and other trading companies, were called upon to\r\ndo the like.(1183)\r\n\r\n(M611)\r\n\r\nSir John Weld, who had been dismissed in 1642 from the office of town\r\nclerk(1184) for failing to attend the Common Council, a duty which he was\r\nrendered incapable of fulfilling owing to his having been appointed at\r\nthat time high-sheriff of Shropshire, seized the opportunity of presenting\r\na petition to the court of Common Council (5 June) to be re-instated in\r\noffice. A committee to whom the matter was referred reported to the\r\ncouncil that they found that it had been by special command of the late\r\nking that Weld had been prevented carrying out his duties, and recommended\r\nthat he should now be restored. The court, however, seemed loth to\r\nre-instate him, and it was not until after the receipt of a letter from\r\nsecretary Nicholas and a writ of restitution had been issued that it\r\nconsented (21 Sept.) to re-admit him to office, and then only by\r\ndeputy.(1185)\r\n\r\n(M612)\r\n\r\nJohn Sadler, who held the office of town clerk at the time, was promptly\r\ngot rid of on a charge of having given judgment in \"a late pretended court\r\nof justice,\" and of having signed the death-warrant of Christopher Love, a\r\nzealous Presbyterian and minister of the church of St. Lawrence, Jewry,\r\nwho had been accused of treason in 1651 and beheaded on Tower Hill in the\r\nmidst of ominous thunderings and clouds of darkness.(1186)\r\n\r\n(M613)\r\n\r\nOn the 4th September the king wrote to the City stating that as by the\r\npassing of the Act of Indemnity many of the aldermen were rendered\r\nincapable of continuing in office, it was his wish that their places\r\nshould be filled by restoring those aldermen who had in times past been\r\nremoved for their allegiance to him. As many of the latter had submitted\r\nto pay fines rather than continue in office against their conscience, he\r\nfurther recommended that these fines should be returned to them.(1187)\r\nPursuant to the king’s wishes, the Common Council formally declared \"that\r\nSir Thomas Adams, Sir Abraham Reynardson, Sir Thomas Soame, Sir John\r\nLangham, Sir James Bunce and Sir Richard Browne are aldermen of this\r\ncity,\" and called upon them to take upon themselves the execution of their\r\nrespective places.(1188)\r\n\r\n(M614)\r\n\r\nOne of these, Sir John Langham, then in his seventy-eighth year, wrote\r\nfrom Crosby House to the Court of Aldermen asking to be excused on the\r\nscore of his advanced age. He had been, he said, laid aside about twelve\r\nyears since and imprisoned in the Tower by order of parliament(1189) (24\r\nSept., 1647), chiefly to prevent his being chosen lord mayor, and had been\r\nreleased on the following 6th June without any effort being made on his\r\npart. He had afterwards (7 April, 1649) been removed from office with Sir\r\nJohn Gayer, Alderman Adams and \"brother\" Bunce by resolution of \"that\r\nremain of a House of Commons that presumed to sit as a parliament,\" and\r\nothers had been chosen in their stead.(1190) The Court of Aldermen acceded\r\nto the veteran’s request(1191)\r\n\r\n(M615)\r\n\r\nAt Michaelmas the citizens would again have placed the royalist Reynardson\r\nin the mayoralty chair, but he excused himself on the ground of\r\nill-health,(1192) and the gallant Alderman Sir Richard Browne was elected\r\nin his stead. A twelvemonth later Reynardson was dead, having passed away\r\non the 4th October, 1661.\r\n\r\n(M616)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (5 July) the king and parliament had been entertained at\r\ndinner by the City with great magnificence. The day was unfortunately\r\nrainy, and Pepys, who seems never to have quite forgotten that he was the\r\nson of a tailor, and never put on a new suit of clothes without recording\r\nthe fact in his diary, remarks that the rain that day \"spoiled many a fine\r\nsuit of clothes.\" The entertainment on this occasion took place at the\r\nGuildhall instead of at the hall of one of the great city companies. The\r\nmayor took the opportunity in the course of the dinner to present the king\r\nwith a \"welcome cupp according to the usuall custome,\" as a token of\r\nloyalty and duty. On the following day the members of the Common Council\r\nand the masters and wardens of those companies which had advanced money to\r\ndefray the cost of the entertainment dined together in the hall, when\r\nthere was \"the same musicke as was the day before at the entertainment of\r\nhis majesty.\"(1193)\r\n\r\n(M617)\r\n\r\nWhen the Entertainment Committee waited on his majesty to thank him for\r\nhis condescension in accepting the City’s entertainment and to crave his\r\npardon for whatever had gone amiss, they took the opportunity of\r\nsatisfying him on certain matters—viz., the repair of St. Paul’s and the\r\nbuilding a drawbridge on London bridge—about which his majesty desired to\r\nbe informed. They at the same time reported the City’s choice of Sir\r\nRichard Browne to be major-general of the City’s forces in the place of\r\nMonk, recently created Duke of Albemarle, who had been obliged to resign\r\nhis commission \"by reason of the multiplicity of affairs in his majesty’s\r\nservice.\"(1194)\r\n\r\n(M618)\r\n\r\nOn the 14th August a deputation from the Lords and Commons attended a\r\ncourt of Common Council and desired a loan of £100,000 on the security of\r\nthe poll tax. The court declined to commit itself to any promise. It was\r\nmuch dissatisfied, and more especially with the inequality of the poll\r\ntax; it therefore preferred submitting the matter to a committee for\r\ninvestigation before giving an answer.(1195) A committee was then and\r\nthere nominated to consider the question.\r\n\r\nBy October matters were so pressing that Charles himself wrote to the\r\nCity, insisting upon the money being advanced within ten days upon the\r\nsecurity of the Act for two months’ assessment about to be levied on the\r\nwhole kingdom, and out of which he solemnly promised, \"on the word of a\r\nking,\" that the loan, both principal and interest, should be repaid before\r\nany other disbursements were made. The money was wanted for the purpose,\r\nhe said, of disbanding the army.(1196)\r\n\r\n(M619) (M620)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this pecuniary difficulty and the existence of certain\r\ngrievances of which the City complained, more especially the abolition of\r\nthe Court of Wards,(1197) for which the king was to receive another\r\n£100,000 by way of compensation, the good relationship between Charles and\r\nthe City still continued; so that when a deputation waited on him with a\r\npetition from the livery companies relative to their Irish estates, the\r\nfollowing gracious reply was given:—\"That his majesty would perform what\r\nhis father had promised and more, and that his majesty would deny the city\r\nnothing; that his majesty found they dealt honestly with him, and his\r\nmajesty would deny them nothing.\"(1198)\r\n\r\n(M621)\r\n\r\nThus far all had gone well with Charles. Within a month of his first\r\nletters from Breda he had recovered his father’s throne without shedding\r\none drop of blood. Of his enemies the more powerful were either in prison\r\nor had fled the country, whilst others had paid the penalty for their\r\nimplication in the death of the late king with their own heads. Danger,\r\nhowever, lurked where least expected. A small band of fanatics known by\r\nthe name of Fifth Monarchy men, who believed in the immediate coming of\r\nChrist upon earth to rule the world, were in the habit of holding meetings\r\nin Coleman Street. On Sunday, the 6th January, 1661, excited by a harangue\r\nuttered by their leader, a wine-cooper named Venner, they broke out, and\r\nwith arms in their hands hurried to St. Paul’s. There they posted\r\nsentries, and demanded of passers-by whom were they for? Upon one of them\r\nreplying that he was for King Charles, he was at once shot by the\r\nfanatics, who cried out that they were for King Jesus. Luckily the city\r\nwas at the time in the hands of that staunch soldier Sir Richard Browne.\r\nUpon his appearance on the scene with an armed force the rioters retreated\r\nto Highgate, but not before they had killed at least half-a-dozen men.\r\nDuring the next two days the streets were strongly patrolled; travellers\r\nabroad were strictly examined as to the nature of their business before\r\nbeing allowed to pass on their way, and suspected persons were disarmed\r\nand compelled to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy.(1199) Every\r\nmoment the return of the rioters was expected, but Monday and Tuesday\r\npassed and none appeared. One of their meeting houses (probably that in\r\nColeman Street) was ordered to be pulled down. At six o’clock on Wednesday\r\nmorning the inhabitants were aroused by hearing again the cry of the\r\nfanatics, \"The King Jesus and their heads upon the gates,\" as they madly\r\nattacked the king’s life guards. Their whole number, it is said, did not\r\namount to much more than thirty, of whom twenty were killed, whilst Venner\r\nand nearly all the rest were made prisoners. When questioned the prisoners\r\none and all refused to make any confession, saying that they would not\r\nbetray the servants of the Lord Jesus.(1200) Ten days later they expiated\r\ntheir crime on the scaffold, and the lord mayor, having received orders to\r\nseize all suspected persons in the city, proceeded to imprison a number of\r\nQuakers. These he kept in confinement until the following March, when all\r\nfear of further disturbance having passed away, they were\r\ndischarged.(1201)\r\n\r\n(M622)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council passed a vote of thanks (25 Jan.) to the lord mayor and\r\nsheriffs for their vigilant conduct during the outbreak,(1202) and\r\nappointed a deputation to wait on his majesty to know his pleasure as to\r\nwhen a day of public thanksgiving should be kept for its timely\r\nsuppression. It also appointed a committee (28 Jan.) to enquire as to the\r\nnumber killed and the best means of raising money for the relief of their\r\nwidows and children.(1203)\r\n\r\n(M623)\r\n\r\nHaving successfully paid off and disbanded the army,(1204) the king turned\r\nhis attention to paying off the navy, for which purpose he sent a\r\ndeputation from the Privy Council to the City (11 March) with a letter\r\nasking for a speedy loan of £100,000. The city fathers at once took steps\r\nto raise the money in the several wards, and any able inhabitant refusing\r\nto subscribe was ordered to be reported to the lord mayor; but three days\r\nlater the king again wrote saying that, as money was coming in from the\r\ncountry quicker than had been anticipated, the loan would not be\r\nrequired.(1205)\r\n\r\n(M624)\r\n\r\nA month had scarcely passed before the Duke of Albemarle, the Earl of\r\nManchester, the Earl of Sandwich, Viscount Valentia, Denzill Holles, and\r\nSir Anthony Ashley Cooper appeared before the court of Common Council (9\r\nApril) with a letter from the king asking for another loan of £60,000. As\r\nthe City was anxious to have its rights and liberties ratified and\r\nconfirmed by a new charter, it did wisely in giving an unanimous assent to\r\nthis demand, more especially as the loan was to be made upon parliamentary\r\nsecurity.(1206)\r\n\r\n(M625)\r\n\r\nThe City had other expenses to meet. The day fixed for the king’s\r\ncoronation (23 April) was drawing near, and preparations had been going on\r\nsince February.(1207) The sum of £6,000 had already been spent in\r\n\"preparing ornaments for his majesty’s passage through the city to his\r\ncoronation,\" and £3,000 more was wanted. The money was immediately\r\nvoted.(1208) On the 1st April the Court of Aldermen nominated twelve\r\ncitizens to assist the chief butler on the day of the coronation,(1209)\r\nwhilst the court of Common Council voted a sum of £1,000 in gold as a gift\r\nto be made by the City to the king on that occasion.(1210)\r\n\r\n(M626)\r\n\r\nThe old regalia having been dispersed, broken up or lost after the death\r\nof Charles I, a commission was given to Sir Robert Vyner, alderman of the\r\ncity and the king’s goldsmith, to make a new set for the coronation of\r\nCharles II. This was accordingly done, care being taken to follow the old\r\npatterns as far as possible. The new regalia comprised two crowns, three\r\nsceptres, an orb, a mace and a quantity of collars, Georges and garters\r\nfor the order of St. George. Vyner also supplied the king with plate for\r\nnew year’s gifts and for his majesty’s own use, the entire cost amounting\r\nto over £30,000.(1211)\r\n\r\n(M627)\r\n\r\nOn the day before the ceremony (22 April) Charles set out from the Tower\r\nto Whitehall. The procession was one of exceptional splendour as it passed\r\nthrough the streets new gravelled for the occasion.(1212) A special\r\ngallery was erected in Cheapside for the city aldermen, as well as a\r\ntriumphal arch.(1213) Pepys, who dearly loved a gala day as affording him\r\nan excuse for putting on new finery, was lost in admiration at the sight\r\nwhich presented itself to his eyes as he viewed the procession from the\r\nwindows of \"Mr. Young’s, the flagmaker,\" in Cornhill, and declared it to\r\nbe \"impossible to relate the glory of this day, expressed in the clothes\r\nof them that rid and their horses and horse-clothes.\" The mayor himself\r\nwas provided with a crimson velvet gown for the occasion.(1214)\r\n\r\n(M628) (M629)\r\n\r\nThe coronation ceremony was carried out the next day with all the\r\ncustomary formalities, and the evening was given up to bonfires and\r\nfireworks, not to mention also a considerable amount of tippling. Even\r\nPepys himself was obliged to confess that he got to his bed only \"pretty\r\nwell.\" There was but one accident worth mentioning during the entire day.\r\nSergeant Glyn, who had formerly been the City’s Recorder, and had\r\nafterwards been raised to the Bench, was nearly killed by his horse\r\nfalling on him whilst riding in the cavalcade with Maynard, another\r\neminent lawyer. Had they both been killed the populace (we are told) would\r\nhave only looked upon it as a judgment of a just God for their action\r\nunder the Commonwealth.(1215)\r\n\r\n(M630)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Convention Parliament had been dissolved and a new one\r\nsummoned to meet in May (1661). When the elections took place there was a\r\nhot contest in the city between Presbyterians and Episcopalians, resulting\r\nin the discomfiture of the latter, \"who went away cursing and swearing and\r\nwishing they had never come.\"(1216) One writer describes the election as\r\nhaving been \"the greatest appearance that ever the oldest men alive\r\nsaw.\"(1217) Great efforts were made to obtain the re-election of those who\r\nhad served the city in the last parliament.(1218) Unfortunately their\r\nnames are not known to us with any certainty. The successful candidates\r\nconsisted of three aldermen, viz., William Thompson, William Love and John\r\nFowke and Captain John Jones. Thompson and Love are described as \"godly\r\nmen and of good parts, Congregationalists,\" Captain Jones as \"a\r\nPresbyterian man,\" and Fowke as one \"not much noted for religion, but a\r\ncountenancer of good ministers,\" and as \"deeply engaged in Bishop’s\r\nlands.\"(1219) Pepys,(1220) who lived in the heart of the city, was himself\r\nsurprised at the \"strange election,\" and at the discomfiture of the\r\nEpiscopalian party, \"that thought themselves so strong. It do so make\r\npeople to feare it may come to worse by being an example to the country to\r\ndo the same. And, indeed, the bishops are so high that very few do love\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n(M631)\r\n\r\nOthers besides Pepys recognised the effect likely to be produced in the\r\ncountry by the example set by London; and those who, unlike Pepys, were of\r\na Presbyterian turn of mind freely expressed their hopes that the keynote\r\nof the election struck by the City would be taken up by the country at\r\nlarge. \"God has overruled the hearts of men and heard the prayers of his\r\npeople in the city election, though the Episcopals were high and thought\r\nto have the day; a precedent is given to the whole country,\" writes a\r\ncontemporary to a friend.(1221) \"The city of London has set a good\r\nexample,\" writes another.(1222) Another expresses a hope that \"other\r\nplaces will be encouraged by the example of this to choose sober and\r\nmoderate men for parliament men\"; whilst another declares \"the city was\r\nvery unanimous and courageous in its choice,\" and that \"if the country do\r\nthe same, profaneness and superstition will no longer prevail, but Godly\r\nmagistrates and ministers be settled in every place.\"(1223)\r\n\r\n(M632) (M633)\r\n\r\nThat the court party were afraid of the effect that the result of the city\r\nelection would have upon the rest of the kingdom, where elections were\r\nstill going on, is evidenced by the fact that these letters just cited, as\r\nwell as numerous others despatched to various parts of the country with\r\ndetails of the election, were intercepted at the post office.(1224)\r\nNeither the hopes of the one party nor the fears of the other as to the\r\neffect of the City’s choice of members upon others were destined to be\r\nrealised to the extent anticipated. The electors proved loyal, and the\r\nmembers returned to the new parliament which met on the 8th May were for\r\nthe most part too young to remember the tyranny of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\n(M634)\r\n\r\nThe new parliament agreed that neither House could claim the command of\r\nthe militia nor lawfully make war upon the king. Act after Act was passed\r\nagainst those who refused to conform to the Established Church. Before the\r\nclose of the year (1661) the Corporation Act received the assent of both\r\nHouses.(1225) Thenceforth no one was to be allowed to hold any municipal\r\noffice unless he renounced the covenant, took the oath of non-resistance,\r\nand received the Sacrament according to the rites of the Church of\r\nEngland. By thus excluding Nonconformists (or \"Dissenters,\" as they began\r\nnow to be called) from municipal corporation, parliament indirectly\r\nexcluded them from seats in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n(M635)\r\n\r\nOn the 9th July the Common Council approved of the presentation of a\r\npetition to the king for a confirmation of the City’s charter.(1226) The\r\ntime was not inopportune, inasmuch as a \"free and voluntary present\" to\r\nCharles had recently been set on foot,(1227) and the maxim of _do ut des_\r\nwas one well understood between the City and the Crown. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that on the 17th an Order in Council was passed to\r\nthe effect that the lord treasurer should assure the City that his majesty\r\nwas highly sensible of their loyalty and affection, and would renew their\r\ncharter with additions if desired and found fit.(1228) The lord chancellor\r\nhappening to be in the city one day (8 Aug.) on the business of the \"free\r\nand voluntary present,\" the civic authorities embraced the opportunity of\r\nurging him to press their suit with the king, whereupon \"it pleased my\r\nlord chancellor to express much affection and forwardness to this great\r\nconcernment of the city,\" and he promised to see the king on the matter\r\nthat same evening, and to get the attorney-general, who was about to leave\r\ntown, to defer his journey if the City would at once forward its old\r\ncharter to Mr. Attorney for the purpose of renewal. This the Common\r\nCouncil readily agreed to do.(1229) In spite, however, of the exertions of\r\nthe lord chancellor and of the City, no renewal of the charter of Charles\r\nI was obtained until nearly two years had elapsed.\r\n\r\n(M636)\r\n\r\nIn October the mayor, aldermen and recorder attended his majesty in\r\ncouncil, by request, when Charles repeated the promise made in his letter\r\nfrom Breda not to diminish or alter the rights of the City; but at the\r\nsame time he informed them of his intention to make one exception, _pro\r\nhac vice_, by removing four or five of the aldermen who had been \"faulty\r\nin the late troubles,\" and of putting others \"of known worth and ability\"\r\nin their places. He promised also to safeguard the City’s interest in the\r\nAct then pending in parliament relative to corporations.(1230) The City\r\ncould not do otherwise than submit,(1231) and the king carried out his\r\nthreat. The commissioners who had been appointed under the Great Seal to\r\n\"regulate\" the Corporation removed at least two of the aldermen, viz.,\r\nTempest Miller, of Candlewick ward, and William Love, of Portsoken, who\r\nhad recently been elected one of the city’s representatives in parliament,\r\ntheir places being filled up by Sir Thomas Rich and Sir Thomas Bludworth,\r\nthe king’s own nominees.(1232)\r\n\r\n(M637)\r\n\r\nPending the negotiations for a renewal of the City’s charter, the\r\nPresbyterians of the city and their ultra-radical brethren the Fifth\r\nMonarchy men again caused disquietude. The latter had been \"scotched not\r\nkilled\" after Venner’s outbreak: \"they are as bold in their meetings as\r\nbefore Venner’s plot; Fifth Monarchy men preach and visit with\r\nPresbyterians, and encourage the people to withstand the common prayer and\r\nthe oppression and idolatry of the court.\"(1233) The mayor had recently\r\nsucceeded in breaking up a meeting and capturing ten men and thirty women,\r\nwhom he lodged in Newgate. When remonstrated with they told the mayor that\r\nthey had met to serve God, and when told that he best served God who\r\nobeyed the king, replied that they were not bound to obey him when the\r\nSpirit commanded the contrary.(1234) It was reported that there were no\r\nless than 3,000 men about the city maintained by Presbyterian\r\nministers.(1235) The danger was increased by the large number of cashiered\r\nofficers and soldiers who frequented the city.(1236) The king became\r\nanxious and wrote to the lord mayor (24 Oct.) complaining of the want of\r\ncare and vigilance in setting the night watches, which consisted chiefly\r\nof feeble men unable to suppress such disorders as were likely to arise in\r\nthose seditious times, and who broke up their watch some hours before\r\ndaybreak, thereby giving encouragement to thieves and robbers. He\r\ntherefore desired that the number of men should be increased, that only\r\nable men should be appointed, and that the watch should continue until\r\ndaybreak.(1237)\r\n\r\n(M638)\r\n\r\nOn Michaelmas-day Sir Richard Browne was succeeded in the mayoralty chair\r\nby Sir John Frederick.(1238) The banquet of the mayor and sheriffs, which\r\nhad been allowed to drop in the time of trouble and scarceness, was again\r\nheld at the Guildhall,(1239) and the new mayor revived the ancient custom\r\nof visiting St. Paul’s on the day of his taking the oath of office, and\r\noffering a prayer for the soul of the good bishop by whose kind offices\r\nthe citizens obtained their first charter from the Conqueror.(1240)\r\nCharles did not attend the banquet which took place on the 29th October,\r\nbut viewed the pageants on lord mayor’s day from the windows of a private\r\nhouse in Cheapside, where he was supplied with refreshments at the City’s\r\ncharge.(1241)\r\n\r\n(M639)\r\n\r\nWhen St. Thomas’s day [21 Dec]—the day for the election of a new Common\r\nCouncil—was approaching, the king took occasion himself to write to the\r\nCourt of Aldermen warning them to \"take special care and give strict\r\norders in your several wards that a peaceable and quiet election be made,\r\nand that the choice be of such persons as are every way well affected to\r\nthe established Government, both in Church and State\"—otherwise he would\r\nbe forced to make a change in such elections.(1242)\r\n\r\n(M640)\r\n\r\nThat the new council was favourable to the king is shown by the court\r\npassing a resolution (26 Feb., 1662) for expunging out of the city’s\r\nrecords all acts, orders and other matters passed, made or registered\r\neither in the court of Common Council or the Court of Aldermen since the\r\nbeginning of the late troubles \"which savour of the disloyalty of those\r\ntimes and may continue the sad remembrance of them to posterity to the\r\nreproach and dishonour of this city.\"(1243) This resolution was made on\r\nthe king’s own suggestions, but although a committee was at once appointed\r\nto carry it out, it remained a dead letter for twenty years.\r\n\r\n(M641)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council had previously (7 Feb.) shown its compliance by\r\nacceding to a demand for a loan of £200,000.(1244) But although the\r\nsecurity offered was undeniably good, and every effort was made to get the\r\ninhabitants of the city to subscribe, no more than £60,000 or £61,000 at\r\nthe most was collected by the 14th March,(1245) and a month later scarcely\r\n£100,000 had been subscribed. The king made no attempt to disguise his\r\nannoyance, and ordered the mayor to call a Common Council and request them\r\nto take steps for the collection of the whole sum.(1246)\r\n\r\n(M642)\r\n\r\nAccording to Pepys, who got his information from a city alderman, the\r\nfinances of the Corporation were at such a low ebb that considerable\r\ndifficulty was experienced in raising so small a sum as 1,000 gold pieces\r\nand the price of a gold cup to be presented to Catharine of Braganza on\r\nher arrival in England \"and that they were fain to call two or three\r\naldermen to raise fines to make up the amount.\"(1247)\r\n\r\n(M643)\r\n\r\nWhilst the civic authorities were vainly struggling to raise the last loan\r\nfor the king, the House of Commons came to his assistance and voted him a\r\ntax of two shillings upon every chimney.(1248) The inquisitorial nature of\r\nthe tax made it very offensive. Returns were to be made of the number of\r\nhearths and stoves in each dwelling by the end of May. As they did not\r\ncome in as quickly as was desired an extension of time was granted until\r\nMidsummer Assizes.(1249) Even when sent in many of the returns were\r\nmanifestly untrue. The returns made for the city of London and Bills of\r\nMortality drew forth a remonstrance from Charles, who refused to attribute\r\nit to anything else but gross negligence or deceit.(1250) He was afraid\r\nlest the ill example set by London should influence the rest of the\r\nkingdom. He expressed himself as willing to bear the expense of finding\r\ntwo or three honest persons in each ward, if required, to join the\r\nconstable in an \"ocular view.\" But in spite of every precaution fraudulent\r\nreturns continued to flow in, and the collection of the tax to be slow and\r\nprecarious.(1251)\r\n\r\n(M644)\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Uniformity Act(1252) which condemned every minister to\r\nlose his benefice unless he signified his assent to everything contained\r\nin the book of common prayer by the 24th August (1662) caused great\r\ndissatisfaction in the city—always a stronghold of Presbyterianism—and\r\nmany a sad scene was witnessed in city churches on Sunday the 17th as\r\nministers took farewell of their congregations.(1253) Driven from the\r\nnational Church, the Presbyterians, like the Baptists, the Quakers and\r\nother \"dissenters\" formed a separate community, happy if only they were\r\ngranted toleration. Many of the inhabitants of the city were already\r\nsuffering confinement for attending \"unlawful assemblies.\" On the occasion\r\nof the queen’s first visit to Westminster the king gave directions to the\r\nmayor and sheriffs to release those Quakers and others who were in gaol in\r\nLondon and Middlesex for having been present at such assemblies, provided\r\nthey professed allegiance and had not been ringleaders or preachers,\r\n\"hoping thereby to reduce them to a better conformity.\"(1254)\r\n\r\n(M645)\r\n\r\nWhen lord mayor’s day came round Charles again viewed the pageant from a\r\nhouse in Cheapside. This time he was accompanied by the queen. The City\r\nsupplied the royal party with refreshments as before.(1255) The new mayor,\r\nSir John Robinson,(1256) had been a promoter of the king’s restoration,\r\nand in return for his services received an augmentation of arms.(1257) He\r\nwas a nephew of the late Archbishop Laud, and full of his own\r\nself-importance \"a talking, bragging, buffle-headed fellow,\" Pepys calls\r\nhim—boasting of his powers over his brother aldermen, but nevertheless\r\nattentive to the wants of the city.(1258)\r\n\r\n(M646)\r\n\r\nA few weeks latter (27 Nov.) the streets of the city again presented a\r\ngala appearance, the occasion being the reception of the Russian\r\nambassador. For the last three winters there had been, we are told, scarce\r\nany frost, and the opening of the year 1662 had been so exceptionally mild\r\nas to cause apprehension of dearth and disease.(1259) But now, on the very\r\nday that the Russian ambassador was to pass through the city from Tower\r\nwharf, where he had landed, he was reminded of his own country by seeing\r\nthe roofs of the houses covered with snow.(1260) At eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning 500 men \"apparelled in velvet coats with chains of gold, well\r\nmounted on horseback,\" from the several livery companies made their way to\r\nTower Hill to escort the ambassador.(1261) The streets were lined with the\r\ncity trained bands and the king’s Lifeguards. Pepys was there of course;\r\nhe rarely missed any sight. He had been disappointed at not getting a\r\nbetter view of Sir Harry Vane’s execution, which had taken place in\r\nJune.(1262) This time he was more fortunate. The ambassador to be sure was\r\nlate, but Pepys beguiled the time with dinner. \"And after I had dined\"—he\r\nrecords in his diary(1263)—\"I walked to the conduit in the quarrefowr, at\r\nthe end of Gracious Street and Cornhill and there (the spouts thereof\r\nrunning very near me, upon all the people that were under it) I saw them\r\npretty well, go by.\" He failed to catch sight of the ambassador himself,\r\nbut was struck with the handsome appearance of the ambassador’s\r\nattendants, most of whom carried hawks on their \"fists\" as a present to\r\nCharles. The strangeness of this sight caused the mob to jeer, upon which\r\nthe diarist characteristically remarks, \"but lord! to see the absurd\r\nnature of Englishmen that cannot forbear laughing and jeering at every\r\nthing that looks strange.\" Later on he makes a note of having seen the\r\nambassador’s retinue at York House engaged in a manner that does not speak\r\nwell for their habits of cleanliness.(1264)\r\n\r\n(M647)\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd February, 1663, the _fiat_ went forth for the confirmation of\r\nthe City’s charter, \"they having fulfilled the required condition of\r\ndisplacing four or five of the aldermen.\"(1265) The charter itself bears\r\ndate the 24th June.(1266) It is of all the City’s charters the most ample,\r\nreciting and confirming as it does the entire _Inspeximus_ Charter of\r\nCharles I, as well as the latter king’s letters patent, granted in the\r\n16th year of his reign, confirming to the mayor and citizens the offices\r\nof package and scavage.\r\n\r\n(M648)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the supplies voted to him by parliament, the advances made\r\nto him by the City, and the handsome dowry he received with his wife,\r\nCharles was continually in want of money. In November, 1662, he had sold\r\nDunkirk to the French king for £200,000, much to the disgust of the\r\nEnglish nation. Nevertheless, his extravagance soon reduced him to want,\r\nand by the following September (1663) he was in such straits that he sent\r\nto the City to borrow the comparatively small sum of £50,000. Seeing that\r\nthe City had so recently received a confirmation of its charter, it could\r\nnot refuse; and the money was raised among the aldermen as being a\r\nspeedier way than applying to the Common Council.(1267)\r\n\r\n(M649)\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the king’s return from a \"great progress\" in October,\r\nhe was met by the mayor and aldermen and 500 members of the several livery\r\ncompanies, well and substantially horsed and apparelled in velvet coats\r\nand chains of gold according to custom.(1268)\r\n\r\n(M650)\r\n\r\nOn the 29th October the new lord mayor, Sir Anthony Bateman, entered upon\r\nhis mayoralty,(1269) with the customary procession and pageant, followed\r\nby a banquet at the Guildhall. The banquet was made the occasion of what\r\nappears on the face of it to have been a studied insult offered—not by the\r\nmunicipal authorities, but by the lord chancellor, the bishops and lords\r\nof the council—to the French ambassador. Whether the lord chancellor and\r\nother high officers of state arrived at the Guildhall before their time,\r\nor the French ambassador came late, one cannot say. But, however that may\r\nhave been, it appears that on the latter’s arrival the others had already\r\ncommenced dinner, with the exception of the mayor himself and the\r\nmunicipal authorities, who had not yet taken their places. On the\r\nambassador approaching the table where the lords sat at dinner, intending,\r\nas he informed the French king by letter,(1270) to rally them on their\r\ngood appetite, he met with such a cold reception that he left the hall to\r\ngo home and dine by himself, in spite of every endeavour on the part of\r\nthe civic officials to smooth matters over. Two hours later the sheriffs\r\npresented themselves at the ambassador’s house, accompanied by a\r\ndeputation from the Common Council, for the purpose of offering excuses\r\nfor the recent _contretemps_. The excuses they had to offer were, however,\r\nof the lamest character, as the ambassador took care to show. Firstly,\r\nthey said they had been taken by surprise. This was manifestly false, as\r\nthe ambassador attended at the Guildhall upon invitation. They next\r\npleaded ignorance and incapacity in receiving one of so high degree, when\r\nthe ambassador reminded them that they had recently done honour to the\r\nSpanish ambassador; and lastly they endeavoured to throw the whole of the\r\nblame upon the master of the ceremonies. This excuse, however, like the\r\nothers, was easily shown to be false, inasmuch as that official was\r\npersonally engaged in escorting the ambassador to the Guildhall and had\r\nnothing to do with the banquet. The deputation thereupon withdrew, being\r\nall the more discomforted by the excess of courtesy shown to them by the\r\nambassador, who himself insisted on escorting them to the door (_je leur\r\ndis que je voulois passer plus avant, et payer un assez mauvais traitement\r\npar une civilité extraordinaire_).\r\n\r\n(M651)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th November the lord mayor went in state to pay a visit to the\r\nambassador and to beg his forgiveness. Not being able to speak French\r\nhimself, he took with him an interpreter, who explained to the ambassador\r\non his behalf that unless he (the ambassador) would set the example of\r\nforgiveness eternal shame would rest upon the citizens and they would\r\nincur the displeasure of the king and nation. Thereupon the ambassador\r\nshowed himself satisfied and attended the lord mayor to his carriage with\r\nmarked courtesy.(1271)\r\n\r\n(M652)\r\n\r\nIn view of a war with the Dutch, which seemed inevitable, owing to their\r\ninterference with English trade, Charles began taking steps to replenish\r\nhis exhausted exchequer. In June and again in October (1664) he borrowed\r\nfrom the city sums of £100,000.(1272) In November the Commons voted him a\r\nsum of two millions and a half, a larger supply than any that had ever yet\r\nbeen granted to a king of England, and the thanks of both Houses were\r\ntendered to the city for its assistance.(1273) On the 22nd February, 1665,\r\nwar was formally declared. Two heralds, in their coats of arms, with four\r\nmace-bearers, nine trumpeters and two troops of horse, assembled at\r\nWestminster, where the trumpet sounded and the declaration was read amid\r\nshouts of joy. \"Thence they went to Temple Bar, where the lord mayor and\r\naldermen, in scarlet gowns on horse-back, conducted them to Temple Gate\r\nover against Chancery Lane, where it was read with more acclamation than\r\nbefore, the Horseguards drawing their swords and clattering them; then\r\nagain in Cheapside and before the Royal Exchange with great demonstration\r\nof joy and sounding of trumpets, after which many nobles of the court came\r\ninto the city to dine with the lord mayor.\"(1274) A day for a public fast\r\nwas appointed to invoke the Almighty’s blessing upon the ignominious war\r\nabout to commence, and all commercial intercourse with the States was\r\ninterdicted.(1275)\r\n\r\n(M653)\r\n\r\nAt this juncture an unfortunate accident occurred which deprived the fleet\r\nof one of its most valuable ships—the ship known as \"The London,\" in which\r\nSir John Lawson was about to put to sea—and caused the death of nearly 300\r\nseamen. \"The London\" was being brought round from Chatham to the Hope,\r\nwhere she was to take on board her commander, when for some unaccountable\r\nreason she blew up and became a total wreck, all her ordnance, numbering\r\n80 brass pieces, going to the bottom. The news of the disaster caused much\r\nexcitement in the city.(1276)\r\n\r\n(M654)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council (17 March) immediately offered its services to the\r\nking, and engaged to build another ship of the same tonnage to supply the\r\nplace of the one that was lost. The king gladly availed himself of the\r\noffer of the City, promising \"to retain the same in memory for the\r\nadvantage of this royal chamber upon all occasions.\"(1277) Pepys’s\r\nacquaintance with the jobbery of the day, more especially in connection\r\nwith naval matters, had his misgivings about the City’s offer. It was a\r\nhandsome offer he acknowledged, \"and if well managed might be done,\" but\r\nhe had his fears lest the work should be put into ill hands.(1278) The\r\nwork was put out to tender, but the final selection of a contractor was\r\nleft to the king.(1279) Precepts were issued to the livery companies to\r\n\"excite and persuade\" their members in every possible way to subscribe to\r\nthe undertaking.(1280) The money, however, was very slow in coming in, no\r\nmore than £4,200 having been subscribed by May, 1666, when at least\r\n£10,000 was estimated to be required.(1281) Nor is this to be wondered at\r\nwhen it was a matter of public notoriety that the money voted expressly by\r\nparliament for fitting out a navy had been uselessly squandered. It was\r\nsaid at the time, although not credited by all, that many showed a\r\nwillingness to advance a large sum of money if the Duke of York would\r\nguarantee its being employed on the navy by himself becoming treasurer of\r\nthe fund; the Duke declined and the offers fell through.(1282)\r\n\r\n(M655)\r\n\r\nPepys’s misgivings about the City’s new ship, called after its predecessor\r\n\"Loyal London,\" appear to have been justified. The ship had to be launched\r\nin an unfinished state, and when her guns came to be tried every one of\r\nthem burst. And yet the vessel was commended by Sir William Coventry, a\r\nnavy commissioner and secretary to the Duke of York, admiral of the fleet,\r\nas \"the best in the world, large and small.\"(1283)\r\n\r\n(M656)\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the war the British fleet was not unattended with\r\nsuccess. On the 3rd June, 1665, the Duke of York gained a signal victory\r\nover Opdam, admiral of the Dutch fleet, in an action fought off the coast\r\nof Suffolk. The report of the guns could be frequently heard on the Thames\r\nand caused much excitement in the city,(1284) to allay which the king\r\ncaused a letter to be despatched to the lord mayor as soon as possible,\r\ngiving details of the engagement and the losses on either side, and\r\nassuring the citizens of the safety of the Duke of York.(1285) Tuesday the\r\n20th was appointed a day of public thanksgiving.(1286)\r\n\r\n(M657)\r\n\r\nSuch a victory at another time would have been hailed with unbounded joy.\r\nAs it was the enthusiasm of the citizens was damped by the presence among\r\nthem of the most awful scourge that had ever yet visited the city. Towards\r\nthe close of 1663 there had been rumours of an outbreak of plague on the\r\ncontinent, and more especially at Amsterdam and Hamburgh. The king\r\ncommunicated with the lord mayor to learn what measures had formerly been\r\ntaken in like case to prevent the spread of infection. It was suggested by\r\nthe Court of Aldermen that, after the custom of other countries, vessels\r\ncoming from infected parts should perform quarantine at Gravesend or the\r\nneighbourhood, where a lazaretto should be established. The proposal was\r\naccepted,(1287) and to these precautions, taken on the instigation of the\r\ncity authorities, was largely due the immunity from infection which the\r\ncity enjoyed for the next fifteen months. In June, 1664, the lords of the\r\ncouncil adopted similar precautions as their own and wrote to the lord\r\nmayor, in view of the increase of the plague in the Netherlands, desiring\r\nhim \"by all waies and meanes possible to be careful that no person or\r\npersons, goods or merchandises whatsoever be permitted to be received or\r\nharboured within the citty of London which come from Holland, Zealand or\r\nany other places infected with the plague, without certificates from the\r\nfarmers of the customs or their officers that they have performed their\r\nquarantain.\"(1288)\r\n\r\n(M658)\r\n\r\nThe plague made its first appearance in the city in June, 1665. The\r\natmosphere had been very sultry—the 7th June being recorded by Pepys as\r\nthe hottest day he had ever felt in his life—and the heat caused the\r\ninfection to spread among the crowded population of the city with amazing\r\nrapidity. Many followed the example set by the king and court and fled to\r\nthe country.(1289) The lord mayor, however, stuck to his post, and the\r\naldermen were forbidden to leave the city without giving notice of some\r\nreasonable cause, those who had already absented themselves being ordered\r\nto return.(1290) The good example thus set was unhappily not followed by\r\nthe city rectors. Many of them, to their shame, forsook their cures in\r\nabject fear, leaving their parishioners to die without the consolations of\r\nthe Church, whilst their pulpits were seized upon by Presbyterian\r\nministers, who embraced the opportunity of publicly declaiming against the\r\nsins of the court and the ill usage to which they had been compelled to\r\nsubmit.(1291) The first Wednesday of every month was appointed to be kept\r\nas a solemn fast day of humiliation until it should please God to put an\r\nend to the sickness.(1292) Schools were closed and inns and taverns kept\r\nopen only for citizens. The streets were cleansed and kept free from\r\nvagrant dogs—always suspected of spreading infection. Nevertheless, the\r\ndeath rate rapidly increased. Pest-houses or hospitals were opened and the\r\nbest medical aid supplied, whilst subscriptions were set on foot for the\r\nbenefit of the poor.(1293) The last week of August claimed 700 victims\r\nwithin the city’s walls, whilst in the week ending the 19th September no\r\nless than 1,189—the highest number recorded perished within the same\r\nlimited area.(1294) The number of deaths that occurred outside the city,\r\nbut within its liberties, was often three or four times larger than of\r\nthose within the city’s walls. Thus for the week last mentioned the number\r\nof deaths from the plague alone in parishes outside the city, but within\r\nits liberties, is returned in the Bills of Mortality as having exceeded\r\n3,000.(1295) The continued increase in the number of deaths in the first\r\nhalf of September was a matter of surprise, for cold weather had set in\r\nand the lord mayor had caused fires to be lighted in the open\r\nthoroughfares for the benefit of the poor that lay starving in the\r\nstreets, as well as (perhaps) with the view of purifying the\r\natmosphere.(1296) When the plague was at its height deaths followed in\r\nsuch rapid succession that the work of burying its victims had to be\r\ncarried on night and day. Even then there was only time to huddle the\r\ncorpses together in a _fosse commune_, and to cover them with a scanty\r\nsupply of earth. Small wonder if complaints were made to the Court of\r\nAldermen of noisome smells arising from the churchyard of St. Mary’s\r\nBethlem. The court immediately (5 Sept.) gave orders for remedying the\r\nevil. No more pits were to be dug, but each corpse was to occupy a\r\nseparate grave, fresh mould was to be laid over places complained of, and\r\nbones and coffin-boards found above ground were to be interred in the\r\nmiddle of the churchyard.(1297)\r\n\r\nThe worst was now over. From the middle of September the number of deaths\r\nin the city began to decrease almost as rapidly as they had risen. In the\r\nfirst week in November there was a sudden increase on the return of the\r\nprevious week, but in the following week there was again a fall, and this\r\ncontinued until in the first week of December the deaths in the city\r\nnumbered only twenty-four. Nevertheless it was thought advisable to\r\nprohibit the usual entertainments which took place after the wardmote\r\nelections on St. Thomas’s day, in order to minimise the risk of\r\ninfection.(1298) The mayor was justified in taking this precaution, for\r\nthe very next week the number of deaths more than doubled itself (57).\r\nThat the city of London was at this time one of the healthiest places in\r\nthe kingdom is shown by the fact that just as it was one of the last\r\nplaces attacked by the plague, so it was one of the first to become free,\r\nin spite of its having been made \"the receptacle of all the people from\r\nall infected places.\"(1299)\r\n\r\nThe total number of victims in the city proper during the twelve month\r\nending the 19th December, 1665, is officially given as 9,887. When we\r\nconsider that the entire population within the city walls—comprising an\r\narea of one square mile, more or less—could scarcely have reached\r\n100,000,(1300) the extent of the calamity becomes appalling; the city was\r\nliterally decimated.\r\n\r\n(M659) (M660)\r\n\r\nWhilst the plague was raging the English fleet had remained in the Thames,\r\nleaving the Dutch masters of the sea. The opening of the new year (1666)\r\nfound England engaged in a war with France, as well as with the Dutch.\r\nLouis, however, was content to leave the English and the Dutch to settle\r\nmatters between themselves at sea. On the 1st June a desperate naval\r\nbattle commenced off the North Foreland and continued for four days, at\r\nthe end of which neither party could claim a victory. Both fleets withdrew\r\nfor repairs. It was at this crisis that the \"Loyal London\" was hastily\r\nlaunched and application made to the city for a loan of £100,000. The\r\nmoney was readily voted, contrary to expectations.(1301)\r\n\r\n(M661)\r\n\r\nWhen the last instalment (£1,500) of the loan was paid into the exchequer,\r\nthe Guildhall and its surroundings were being threatened with destruction\r\nby the Great Fire,(1302) which, breaking out on the night of Saturday, 1st\r\nSeptember, 1666, or early on Sunday morning, at a baker’s shop in Pudding\r\nLane, within five days reduced the greater part of the city to ashes. The\r\nking had long ago anticipated such a calamity, arising from the narrowness\r\nof the streets and the overhanging houses built for the most part of wood.\r\nMore than a year before (11 April, 1665) he had written to the mayor,\r\nrecorder and aldermen of the city(1303) warning them of the danger and\r\nrecommending a more diligent execution of the Act for the repair of\r\nhighways and sewers. He authorised them to imprison such persons as, after\r\ndue warning, continued to erect buildings in contravention of the Act, and\r\nto pull the buildings down. He further desired them to open Temple Bar and\r\nthe passage and gatehouse of Cheapside in St. Paul’s Churchyard, as\r\nmentioned in the Act, and he would himself inspect what progress was being\r\nmade in carrying out these improvements. He concluded by declaring that he\r\nhad made the city his royal residence,(1304) and had received from it such\r\nmarks of loyalty and affection as would ever make him concerned for its\r\nwealth, trade, reputation, beauty and convenience.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the fire at first caused no uneasiness, such sights being\r\nonly too common. But when no less than 300 houses had been destroyed\r\nwithin a few hours, and the flames, carried by a strong east wind that\r\nprevailed, threatened others, the inhabitants began to take alarm. The\r\nmayor, Sir Thomas Bludworth, was early on the scene, but he lacked\r\ndecision of character and failed to keep his head. He endeavoured to carry\r\nout the king’s orders by pulling down houses to prevent the fire\r\nspreading, but as often as not he was overtaken by the flames. \"Lord, what\r\ncan I do?\" he lack-a-daisically exclaimed in answer to a message from the\r\nking; \"I am spent; people will not obey me. I have been pulling down\r\nhouses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.\"(1305) The\r\ninhabitants were too busy removing their furniture and effects to a place\r\nof safety to render much assistance to the mayor, but he found willing\r\nhands in the soldiers supplied by the king and the Duke of York, both of\r\nwhom displayed great personal energy. \"The Duke of York,\" wrote an\r\neye-witness of the mournful scene,(1306) \"hath wonn the hearts of the\r\npeople wth his continuall and indefatigable paynes day and night in\r\nhelping to quench the fire, handing bucketts of water with as much\r\ndiligence as the poorest man that did assist; if the lord maior had done\r\nas much his example might have gone far towards saveing the citty.\"\r\n\r\n(M662)\r\n\r\nIn spite of every effort to stay its progress the fire continued to rage\r\nthroughout the whole of Monday and Tuesday. By this time Lombard Street,\r\nCannon Street and Gracechurch Street had been reduced to ashes. The houses\r\non London Bridge were attacked and Southwark threatened with destruction.\r\nOn Wednesday the flames devastated Cornhill and the Exchange. The\r\nfollowing day they got hold of St. Paul’s (at that time undergoing repairs\r\nand surrounded with scaffolding), and were carried by the east wind\r\ntowards the Temple and Hatton Garden. The brick buildings of the Temple\r\noffered a more stubborn resistance than the wooden buildings of the city,\r\nand prevented the fire spreading further westward.(1307) In the meantime\r\nresort was had to gunpowder for the quicker destruction of houses in the\r\ncity, and by this means much was eventually saved which otherwise would\r\ninevitably have been lost. But this was not done without considerable\r\nopposition from the owners of houses who objected to their property being\r\nblown up if there was a chance of it being saved.(1308) At last the\r\n\"horrid, malicious, bloody flame,\" described by Pepys as so unlike the\r\nflame of an ordinary fire, burnt itself out, and at the close of Thursday,\r\nthe 6th September, the inhabitants of the city were able for the first\r\ntime since the outbreak to seek a night’s rest without fear of further\r\ndanger. When they rose the next morning and contemplated the extent of the\r\nhavoc wrought on their city by the fire, the hearts of many must have\r\nfairly sunk within them. At least four-fifths of the whole of the\r\nbuildings situate within the walls had been reduced to ashes. The official\r\nreport was that no less than 13,200 houses and eighty-nine parish\r\nchurches, besides St. Paul’s and divers chapels, were destroyed, and that\r\nonly seventy-five acres out of a total of 373 acres of ground within the\r\nwalls escaped the conflagration.(1309) These seventy-five acres chiefly\r\nlay in the vicinity of Aldgate and Tower Hill, and probably owed their\r\nimmunity from the fire to the free use of gunpowder, for it was in Tower\r\nStreet, Pepys tells us, that the practice of blowing up houses began. Most\r\nof the livery companies lost their halls. Clothworkers’ Hall burned for\r\nthree days and three nights, the flames being fed with the oil that was\r\nstored in its cellars. The Leaden Hall was partly saved. Gresham House\r\nalso escaped; but the Guildhall suffered severely, its outer walls only\r\nbeing left standing.\r\n\r\n(M663)\r\n\r\nMuch dissatisfaction was displayed against Bludworth for his want of\r\nresolution during the crisis,(1310) and when Michaelmas-day arrived, and\r\nhe was about to go out of office, he was called to account for his\r\nconduct. In anticipation of lord mayor’s day he wrote to Joseph\r\nWilliamson, afterwards Secretary of State, bespeaking his favour and\r\nsupport. He professed not to live by popular applause (he said), but he\r\nneeded and desired the support and esteem of government, \"having had the\r\nmisfortune to serve in the severest year that ever man did.\"(1311)\r\n\r\n(M664)\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the fire the wildest rumours at the time prevailed,\r\nand for years afterwards it was commonly attributed to Papists wishing to\r\ndestroy the stronghold of the reformed religion, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat not a scintilla of evidence was forthcoming in support of such a\r\ncharge, after a most careful investigation.(1312) The citizens were not\r\nsatisfied with the first inquiry, and in March, 1668, a petition was\r\nprepared to lay before parliament to re-open the question and to receive\r\nfresh evidence.(1313) Thirteen years later the belief that the Papists had\r\na hand in causing the wholesale destruction of the city was formally\r\npromulgated by the House of Commons (10 Jan., 1681),(1314) and the same\r\nbelief was perpetuated by an inscription on the Monument commemorating the\r\nfire, an inscription which met with the approval of the municipal\r\nauthorities of the day.(1315)\r\n\r\n(M665)\r\n\r\nSir Patience Ward happened to be mayor at the time, but was probably no\r\nmore responsible for the inscription than any other member of the Court of\r\nAldermen or Common Council, notwithstanding the severe reflection passed\r\nupon him by his namesake Thomas Ward,(1316) who, speaking of Titus Oates\r\nand his bogus \"discoveries,\" wrote:\r\n\r\n\"He swore—with flaming faggot sticks,\r\nIn sixteen hundred sixty-six,\r\nThat they through London took their marches,\r\nAnd burnt the city down with torches;\r\nYet all invisible they were,\r\nClad in their coats of Lapland air.\r\nThe sniffling Whig-mayor Patience Ward\r\nTo this damn’d lie paid such regard,\r\nThat he his godly masons sent,\r\nT’ engrave it round the Monument:\r\nThey did so; but let such things pass—\r\nHis men were fools, himself an ass.\"\r\n\r\n(M666)\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James II the obnoxious inscription was removed, but\r\nthe feeling against Papists had obtained so strong a hold over the popular\r\nmind, that it was again set up as soon as William III came to the\r\nthrone.(1317) There it remained until 1830, when, wisdom having come with\r\nyears, it was finally removed by order of the Common Council (6\r\nDec.).(1318) No longer is it true, in the words of Pope, that\r\n\r\n\"... London’s column pointing at the skies\r\nLike a tall bully lifts the head and lies.\"\r\n\r\n(M667)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fire began to abate measures were taken to provide food for\r\nthe houseless poor. A detachment of 200 soldiers was ordered to London\r\nfrom Hertfordshire with carts laden with pickaxes, ropes, buckets, etc.,\r\nto prevent any further outbreak, whilst the justices of the peace and\r\ndeputy lieutenants were instructed to forward provisions to the city,\r\nespecially bread and cheese, lest the much suffering inhabitants should\r\nperish from starvation.(1319)\r\n\r\n(M668)\r\n\r\nThe City received much sympathy and no little assistance from other\r\ncities, both in England and Ireland. The city of York not only despatched\r\nits town clerk to London to express its condolences with the Londoners in\r\ntheir great loss, but the lord mayor of York wrote (17 Sept.) to the lord\r\nmayor of London to tell him that a small sum of money—\"as much as this\r\npoore decayed citty could furnish us with\"—was on its way to London for\r\nthe relief of the most necessitous and distressed.(1320)\r\n\r\n(M669)\r\n\r\nTen days later (29 Sept.) Lord Ormond and the Lords of the Council of\r\nIreland wrote to Bludworth expressing their hearty sorrow at the calamity\r\nthat had befallen the citizens of London, who had shown so much humanity\r\nand kindness to the Protestants of Ireland in the late rebellion. They\r\ndesired to assist the city in its distress, but money was so scarce in\r\nIreland that they were compelled to ask the city to accept the greater\r\npart of such assistance as that country could offer in cattle, which\r\nshould be despatched either alive or slaughtered, as his lordship should\r\nprefer, to any port in Ireland. But before this could be done the assent\r\nof parliament would have to be obtained.(1321)\r\n\r\n(M670)\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Londonderry sent a deeply sympathetic and affectionate\r\nletter to their \"deare mother citty,\" and forwarded a sum of £250 to\r\nassist those \"who buylt or howses now their oune are in ashes.\" They could\r\nnot send more (they said) because of the deep poverty that lay upon their\r\ncity and the general want of money throughout the country. What they did\r\nsend they sent as an expression of their love and duty to their \"honoured\r\nmother.\"(1322)\r\n\r\n(M671)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a special Court of Aldermen had met in the afternoon of\r\nThursday, the 6th September, and appointed Gresham House for the meetings\r\nof the Court of Aldermen and Common Council, and for transacting the\r\ngeneral municipal business of the city until further order. The mayor and\r\nthe sheriffs, whose houses had been destroyed, were also to take up their\r\nlodging there during the remainder of their year of office. The Exchange,\r\ntoo, was ordered to be kept in the gardens or walks of Gresham House. The\r\nhouse was to be got ready with all speed, and the governor of the East\r\nIndia Company was to be desired to see that the pepper stored in the walks\r\nwas removed without delay. Temporary sites were at the same time appointed\r\nfor the various markets until better accommodation could be found. Those\r\nwho had been rendered houseless were allowed to erect sheds on the void\r\nplaces of London Bridge. It was further resolved to entreat his majesty to\r\nsend tents into Finsbury Fields for housing the poor until they could\r\nprovide themselves with habitations. The other wants of the poor were to\r\nbe supplied as far as possible by the masters, wardens and assistants of\r\nthe several companies of which they happened to be members.(1323) On\r\nFriday the court again met at Gresham House, when it gave orders for the\r\nruins of the Guildhall to be cleared of all rubbish. Melted lead, iron,\r\nand such other materials as were of value were to be picked out and stored\r\nfor further use. The passages to the Guildhall were to be boarded up. The\r\nchamberlain was ordered to remove his office to Gresham House; and thither\r\nalso were to go the deputy town clerk and the city swordbearer, whose\r\nhouses had been consumed. They were to take with them the city’s records\r\nand such books and papers as were in actual use.(1324)\r\n\r\n(M672)\r\n\r\nThe next day (8 Sept.) the court gave permission for any freeman of the\r\ncity to erect a tent or shed wherein to carry on his trade or craft on any\r\npart of the artillery ground, or if he so wished, either outside London\r\nwall between the postern near Broad Street and Moorgate, or within the\r\nwall between the said postern and Coleman Street. He might also erect his\r\ntent or shed in the \"Round\" at Smithfield. But in every case the ground\r\nwas to be set out as apportioned by the mayor and sheriffs with the\r\nassistance of \"Mr.\" [Peter] Mills. Those who had formerly kept shop in the\r\nupper \"pawne\" of the Royal Exchange were at the same time permitted to\r\nerect sheds under certain conditions.(1325)\r\n\r\n(M673)\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 10th September, the Common Council met. It is the first\r\ncourt since the fire of which any record has come down to us. Its first\r\ncare was to order every street and lane in each ward to be cleared of all\r\nrubbish by the late inhabitants, \"every one before his grounds,\" and by no\r\none else. It next proceeded to nominate a committee of aldermen and\r\ncommoners to consider the best means of raising the city out of its ruins,\r\nand it was agreed that the Common Council should sit every Wednesday at\r\nGresham House.(1326)\r\n\r\n(M674)\r\n\r\nWhen the fire was at its height the king had been anxious to send for the\r\nDuke of Albemarle, but hesitated to do so fearing lest he would be\r\nunwilling to be ordered home whilst engaged in the Dutch war.(1327)\r\nRepresentations of the king’s wishes, however, having been made to the\r\nduke, he hurried home. On the 12th September a committee was appointed by\r\nthe Court of Aldermen to wait upon him with a draft proclamation for the\r\ndiscovery and restoration of goods taken either wilfully, ignorantly, or\r\nof purpose during the confusion consequent on the late fire.(1328) The\r\nquantity of plate, money, jewels, household stuff, goods and merchandise\r\ndiscovered among the ruins was very great, and much of it had quickly been\r\nmisappropriated. The proclamation ordered all persons who had so\r\nmisappropriated property to bring the same within eight days into the\r\narmoury in Finsbury Fields; and by order of the Common Council no such\r\nproperty was to be given up to any claimant without permission of the\r\nCourt of Aldermen or the lord mayor and sheriffs for the time being.(1329)\r\n\r\n(M675)\r\n\r\nA month later (19 Oct.) a letter was addressed to the mayor signed by the\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, the lords Clarendon, Albemarle, Manchester,\r\nArlington and others, complaining that sundry materials of city churches\r\ndestroyed by the fire had been embezzled and stolen, and also that smiths’\r\nforges and other artificers’ shops and even alehouses were kept within the\r\nsacred ruins. The mayor was directed, with the assistance of the Court of\r\nAldermen, to obtain inventories of all communion plate, vestments,\r\nrecords, books and other goods belonging to each church that the fire had\r\ndestroyed, and of all that remained to each church after the fire, and he\r\nwas to cause the plate and goods that survived the fire to be preserved\r\nfor future use in their respective churches. He was further directed to\r\ncollect and preserve the lead, bells and other appurtenances and materials\r\nof the various churches in order to assist in repairing and re-building\r\nthem, and to prohibit any trade or selling of ale, beer, tobacco or\r\nvictuals within their precincts.(1330)\r\n\r\n(M676)\r\n\r\nOne effect of the fire, which was estimated at the time to have destroyed\r\nhouses of the rental value of £600,000 a-year,(1331) was seen in the lack\r\nof pageantry which usually marked the day when the newly elected mayor\r\nproceeded to the Exchequer to be sworn. When Bludworth’s successor—Sir\r\nWilliam Bolton—went to take the oath on the 29th October, the meanness of\r\nthe appearance of the civic fathers was remarked by the on-lookers, who\r\nreflected \"with pity upon the poor city ... compared with what it\r\nheretofore was.\"(1332)\r\n\r\n(M677)\r\n\r\nAnother result was that when the day for election of members of the Common\r\nCouncil was approaching, the Court of Aldermen, considering how difficult\r\nit would be, if not absolutely impossible, to hold the customary\r\nwardmotes, resolved to present a Bill to Parliament for permitting the\r\nsitting members to continue in their places for the year next ensuing\r\nwithout any election being held.(1333)\r\n\r\n(M678)\r\n\r\nFourteen years after the fire (_i.e._, towards the close of the year 1680)\r\nthe City projected a scheme for insurance against fire, and in 1681 a deed\r\nof conveyance of city lands of the estimated value of £100,000 was\r\nexecuted by the City to certain trustees as security to persons effecting\r\ninsurances against fire.(1334) That the municipal body of the city should\r\nundertake a business of insurance and thus compete with private enterprise\r\ngave rise to no little discontent among the \"gentlemen of the insurance\r\noffice\" carrying on business \"on the backside of the Royal Exchange,\" who\r\nclaimed to have originated the idea.(1335)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M679)\r\n\r\nThe Great Fire had scarcely ceased smouldering before the inhabitants of\r\nthe city set to work re-building their devastated houses. Information\r\nhaving reached the ear of the king that building operations were about to\r\nbe carried out on the old foundations, he instructed Sir William Morice,\r\nsecretary of state, to write to the lord mayor to put a stop to them until\r\nfurther orders, as his majesty had under consideration certain models and\r\nplans for re-building the city \"with more decency and conveniency than\r\nformerly.\"(1336) Charles himself also wrote at the same time to the mayor\r\nand aldermen desiring them to afford every assistance to Wenceslas Hollar\r\nand Francis Sandford, whom he had appointed to make an exact survey of the\r\ncity as it stood after the fire.(1337) The civic authorities on their part\r\ninstructed Robert Hooke to devise a scheme for re-building the city, and\r\non the 21st September he presented to the Common Council \"an exquisite\r\nmodell or draught\" which found much favour with the court.(1338) Early in\r\nthe following month (4 Oct.) the Common Council was informed that for the\r\ngreater expedition in carrying out the work of re-building the city, the\r\nking had appointed Wren and two others to make a survey, with the\r\nassistance of such surveyors and workmen as the civic authorities should\r\nnominate. The city’s choice fell upon Robert Hooke, described as \"Reader\r\nof the Mathematicks in Gresham Colledge,\" Peter Mills and Edward Jermyn or\r\nJarman. By way of preparation for the survey, the owners of houses that\r\nhad been destroyed were again ordered (9 Oct.) to clear their foundations\r\nof rubbish, and to pile up the bricks and stones within fourteen days, so\r\nthat every man’s property might be \"more exactly measured and\r\nasserted.\"(1339)\r\n\r\n(M680)\r\n\r\nThe impracticability of re-building the city except on old foundations\r\nsoon become manifest, and the handsome design which Wren prepared had to\r\nbe dismissed. There was difficulty enough as it was, and the four sworn\r\nviewers of the city whose duty at ordinary times was to guard against\r\nencroachments and other nuisances were unusually busy. Sometimes the old\r\nfoundations proved too weak to support a new building, sometimes the new\r\nbuilding threatened to encroach on the public thoroughfare. Such matters\r\nrequired the constant attention of the viewers. Disputes would also arise\r\nbetween the landlords and tenants of houses destroyed by the fire. In\r\norder to settle all differences that arose, a special Court of Judicature\r\nwas established by Act of Parliament (31 Jan., 1667).(1340) The court sat\r\nat Clifford’s Inn, and the decrees signed by the judges, as well as the\r\nportraits of the judges themselves, are preserved at the Guildhall.(1341)\r\nThe city authorities were very urgent in getting this Act passed, and\r\npressed the judges to give the Bill all dispatch they could, \"as a matter\r\nof principal concernment and encouragement to the great worke of\r\nre-building the citty.\" This their lordships promised to do.(1342)\r\n\r\n(M681)\r\n\r\nIt was not deemed in any way derogatory in those days to give and receive\r\npresents for services either past or prospective. We need not be surprised\r\ntherefore to find that whilst this and other Bills in which the City was\r\ninterested were before Parliament, the Court of Aldermen voted a sum of\r\n£100 in gold as a gift to the Speaker of the House of Commons, \"as a\r\nloving remembrance from this court for his many kind offices performed to\r\nthe State of this citty.\"(1343)\r\n\r\n(M682)\r\n\r\nWhilst a Bill for re-building the city was being prepared for parliament\r\nthe civic authorities were busy considering how to find the money\r\nnecessary for re-building the Guildhall, the city’s gates, the prisons and\r\nother public buildings. On the 6th November (1666) the Court of Aldermen\r\nresolved to sit every Wednesday afternoon at the house of the new lord\r\nmayor (Sir William Bolton) to consider this important question, and to\r\ncontinue such weekly sittings until the matter was settled.(1344)  It was\r\nnot long before the court determined to apply to parliament for an\r\nimposition of twelve pence a chaldron on coals brought into the Port of\r\nLondon, wherewith to meet the expense. The advice and assistance of the\r\nsolicitor-general and of Sir Job Charlton were to be solicited, and £10 in\r\n\"old gold\" given to each of them, in addition to \"such other charges and\r\nrewards\" as might be necessary for the furtherance of the business.(1345)\r\nLater on the court resolved to approach the Lord Chancellor and to entreat\r\nhim to recommend the City’s proposals to his majesty and to the House of\r\nLords.(1346) By the end of November the Common Council had agreed to\r\ncertain \"heads thought requisite to be inserted\" into the Bill for\r\nre-building the city,(1347) and on the 29th December the Bill was brought\r\nin and read the first time.\r\n\r\nFor fear lest some of the clauses might offend the king a petition was\r\ndrawn up for presentation to his majesty, in which matters were explained,\r\nand his majesty’s favourable interpretation and pardon asked for anything\r\nomitted in the Bill or done amiss.(1348) A report had got abroad that the\r\nCity had caused a clause to be inserted in the Bill forbidding any one to\r\nengage in building operations who refused to abjure the Covenant. This\r\nmade the Common Council very angry, and the mayor and sheriffs were\r\ndesired to investigate the matter.(1349) On the 5th February (1667) the\r\nBill passed the Commons, and two days later received the assent of the\r\nLords.(1350)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Court of Aldermen had drafted (22 Jan.) a petition to\r\nthe king for permission to introduce a Bill for an impost on coals, to\r\nassist the City in re-building the conduits, aqueducts and other public\r\nworks, as it had \"no common stock, nor revenue, nor any capacity to raise\r\nwithin itself anything considerable towards so vast an expense.\"(1351) But\r\ninstead of a new Bill for this purpose, a clause was inserted in the Bill\r\nfor re-building the city (Stat. 19 Car. II, c. 3), authorising such an\r\nimpost as was desired.(1352)\r\n\r\n(M683)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council directed (19 Feb.) the lord mayor, the recorder and the\r\nsheriffs to attend the king and the Duke of York with the most humble\r\nthanks of the court for the favour they had shown the City in passing the\r\nBill, and to learn his majesty’s pleasure as to the enlargement of the\r\nstreets of the city in pursuance of the recent Act.(1353)\r\n\r\n(M684)\r\n\r\nOn the 12th March certain proposals for widening streets which had\r\nreceived the approval of the Common Council were submitted to Charles at a\r\ncouncil held at Berkshire House, now Cleveland House, St. James’s. On the\r\nfollowing day they were returned to the Common Council with his majesty’s\r\nrecommendations and suggestions thereon. The same day (13 March), the City\r\nnominated Peter Mills, Edward Jarman, Robert Hooke and John Oliver to be\r\nsurveyors and supervisors of the houses about to be re-built; the king’s\r\ncommissioners, Christopher Wren, Hugh May and \"Mr.\" Prat being ordered by\r\nhis majesty to afford them their best advice and assistance whenever it\r\nshould be required.(1354)\r\n\r\nIn September the king suggested the appointment of Sir William Bolton, the\r\nlord mayor, as surveyor-general for the re-building of the city. The\r\nsuggestion was referred to a committee, who reported to the Common Council\r\n(25 Oct.) their opinion that there was \"noe use or occasion for a\r\nsurveyor-generall,\" as the work could be well and sufficiently managed by\r\nthe surveyors already appointed.(1355)\r\n\r\n(M685)\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Building Act the Common Council proceeded (21 March) to\r\nparcel out the streets of the city, placing them under the several\r\ncategories of \"high and principal streets,\" \"streets or lanes of note,\"\r\nand \"by-lanes.\"(1356) The scheme met with the approval of the king and\r\ncouncil.(1357) Towards the end of the following month (29 April) a\r\nschedule was drawn up of streets and narrow passages which it was proposed\r\nto enlarge.(1358) For the next few months the authorities were busy seeing\r\nto the clearing and staking out of the various streets.(1359) In September\r\nthe Common Council resolved that the new street which it was proposed to\r\nmake from the Guildhall to Cheapside should be called King Street, whilst\r\nits continuation from Cheapside to the river should be known as Queen\r\nStreet.(1360)\r\n\r\n(M686)\r\n\r\nA fresh distribution of markets and market places was proposed (21\r\nOct.).(1361) Three markets and no more were to be allotted for the sale of\r\nflesh and other victuals brought into the city by country butchers and\r\nfarmers, viz., Leadenhall and the Greenyard for the east end of the city,\r\nHoney Lane for the centre, and a market near Warwick Lane, which was to\r\ntake the place of Newgate Market, for the west end. Two places were to be\r\nassigned for herb and fruit markets, viz., the site of the king’s wardrobe\r\n(if the king would give his consent) and the ground whereon recently had\r\nstood the church of St. Laurence Pulteney. The markets formerly held in\r\nAldersgate Street and Gracechurch Street were to be discontinued. A place\r\nwas to be found at or near Christ Church as a site for the meat market,\r\nhitherto kept in Newgate market. These suggestions were with slight\r\nalteration accepted in the following February (1668), when provision was\r\nalso made for a fish market on the site of the ancient stocks and the\r\nWoolchurch and churchyard.(1362) On the 23rd Oct. (1667) the king went in\r\nstate into the city to lay \"the first stone of the first pillar of the new\r\nbuilding of the Exchange.\"(1363)\r\n\r\n(M687)\r\n\r\nThe impost of twelve pence a chaldron on coals brought into the port of\r\nLondon was soon found inadequate to meet the expense of re-building the\r\nGuildhall, the prisons and other public edifices of the city, and in 1670\r\nit was raised by statute (22 Car. II, c. 11) to two shillings a chaldron.\r\nGreat irregularities, however, were allowed to take place in collecting\r\nand accounting for the duty thus imposed, and between 1667 and 1673 the\r\nCity was obliged to borrow no less than £83,000.(1364) In March, 1667, the\r\nCourt of Aldermen resolved that all fines paid by persons to be discharged\r\nfrom the office of alderman between that day and Midsummer next should be\r\ndevoted to the restoration of the Guildhall and the Justice Hall, Old\r\nBailey.(1365) Not only money but material also was required to enable the\r\nCity to carry out its building operations. To this end a Bill was\r\nintroduced into parliament to facilitate the City’s manufacture of lime,\r\nbrick and tile.(1366) A sub-tenant of the City holding five acres of land\r\nin the parish of St. Giles in the Fields obtained permission from the\r\nCourt of Aldermen to \"digg and cast upp the said ground for the making of\r\nbricke any covenant or clause in the lease of the said ground to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\"(1367) Application was made to Charles for\r\nliberty to fetch Portland stone for the City’s use, but this was refused\r\nas the stone was required for works at Whitehall.(1368)\r\n\r\n(M688)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile negotiations for a peace had been opened at Breda. The\r\nLondoners more especially desired peace(1369) in order to devote their\r\nenergies to re-building their city. In anticipation of a cessation of\r\nhostilities Charles set about discharging his navy, leaving the Thames and\r\nMedway open to attack. The Dutch took advantage of his precipitancy and at\r\nonce sailed up the Medway, burnt three men-of-war, among them being the\r\n\"Loyal London,\" and carried off a fourth.(1370) This took place in June\r\n(1667). The city never presented so dejected an appearance as on the\r\narrival of the news of this disgrace. The cry of treason was raised and\r\nendeavours made to fasten the blame upon any one and every one. The Dutch\r\nfleet was every hour expected up the Thames,(1371) and vessels were sunk\r\nin the bed of the channel at Barking, Woolwich and Blackwall to stop its\r\nprogress. But so great was the confusion that one of the king’s store\r\nships for victualling the navy is said to have been sunk among the rest,\r\nas well as vessels that had been fitted out as fire-ships at great\r\nexpense. The Common Council interposed on behalf of interested owners of\r\nmerchandise on board the ship \"Diana,\" lying in the Thames, to prevent if\r\npossible the sinking of that vessel.(1372)\r\n\r\n(M689)\r\n\r\nThe Common Council ordered (13 June) every able-bodied man in the city\r\nforthwith to enlist, and resolved to petition the king that the\r\nauxiliaries then to be raised might remain as a guard to the city.(1373)\r\nThe same day the city’s militia was reviewed by Charles himself on Tower\r\nHill. He addressed them in a speech assuring them that he would personally\r\nshare their danger. But here, too, was confusion and lack of organization.\r\n\"The city is troubled at their being put upon duty,\" wrote Pepys (14\r\nJune), \"summoned one hour and discharged two hours after: and then again\r\nsummoned two hours after that; to their great charge as well as trouble.\"\r\n\r\n(M690)\r\n\r\nAbove all there was a lack of money to pay the seamen. Had the Dutch fleet\r\nsailed up the Thames immediately after its success at Chatham, instead of\r\nwasting its time at Portsmouth and Plymouth and other places on the south\r\ncoast, matters would have gone hard with the capital. As it was the delay\r\ngave time for recovery from the recent scare and for measures to be taken\r\nagainst its approach, with the result that after getting up the river as\r\nfar as Tilbury it was compelled to retire.(1374)\r\n\r\n(M691)\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th June the Dutch fleet was believed to be sailing\r\nhomewards, but by midday news arrived of its appearance off Harwich, which\r\nwas threatened with an immediate attack.(1375) The next day (21 June) the\r\nmayor and aldermen obeyed a summons to attend upon the king in council,\r\nwhen, a proposal having been made to fortify Sheerness and other places on\r\nthe river, they agreed to raise the sum of £10,000 for the purpose.(1376)\r\nThat the government should be driven to borrow so small a sum excited the\r\ncontempt of Pepys, who thought it \"a very poor thing that we should be\r\ninduced to borrow by such mean sums.\" That the City could afford no more\r\nis not surprising when we consider what had been the state of trade during\r\nthe last three years. As it was the money was paid by small instalments.\r\nThe coffers of the city merchant or goldsmith keeping \"running cashes\"\r\nwere well nigh empty, and the credit of some of the best men was\r\nshaken.(1377)\r\n\r\n(M692)\r\n\r\nThere was another difficulty besides the want of money. There was a\r\ndeficiency of workmen to carry out the works at Sheerness. Application was\r\naccordingly made to the wardens of the several companies of masons and\r\nbricklayers to furnish able men so that the fortifications might be\r\ncompleted before the cold weather came on.(1378)\r\n\r\n(M693)\r\n\r\nAt last negotiations for a peace were concluded and the Treaty of Breda\r\nwas signed (31 July). The peace was proclaimed at Temple Bar in the\r\npresence of the lord mayor on St. Bartholomew’s Day (24 Aug.).\r\n\r\nThe bells were set ringing in honour of the event, but there were no\r\nbonfires at night \"partly\"—writes Pepys—\"from the dearness of firing, but\r\nprincipally from the little content most people have in the peace.\" Yet\r\nthe terms of the treaty were not wholly ruinous to the country. England,\r\nat least, gained New York, hitherto known as New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n(M694)\r\n\r\nThe lull in the storm afforded the municipal authorities an opportunity of\r\ntaking stock of their own Chamber. To this end a committee was appointed\r\non the 12th February, 1668. For nine months that committee was employed\r\nexamining the state of the City’s finances, and then had not finished\r\ntheir task. Nevertheless, on the 23rd November they made a report to the\r\nCommon Council of the result of their labours so far as they had\r\ngone.(1379) The state of the Chamber, they said, was so low that it would\r\nrequire the utmost care and industry to restore it and save it from utter\r\ndecay and ruin, \"for what by misemployment of the treasure in the late\r\ntroubles and other ill managements,\" as well as by extraordinary expenses\r\noccasioned by the Plague and Fire, the City’s debt had still increased\r\nnotwithstanding its income having been largely augmented by fines of\r\naldermen and chamber and bridge-house leases, which within the last\r\nfifteen years had exceeded £200,000. It was clear that when these\r\nextraordinary accessories to the City’s income ceased—and they had already\r\nbegun to decline—the City’s debt would increase and would indeed become\r\ndesperate unless some remedy were found. The committee, therefore, made\r\ncertain suggestions with the view of cutting down expenses. The City\r\nChronologer,(1380) in the first place, could be dispensed with altogether.\r\nThe salary of the City Waits, which had lately been increased, should be\r\nreduced to its former amount. Some saving might be made in allowance of\r\nstationery in the various offices, in expenses attending Courts of\r\nConservancy, in allowance of boots to City labourers and artificers. The\r\npersonal expenses of the City’s Remembrancer for diet, coach hire, boat\r\nhire, etc., should be no longer allowed; and the Chamber should not be\r\ncalled upon to make any disbursement for military purposes beyond the sum\r\nof £4,666 13_s._ 4_d._, for which the City was yearly liable by Act of\r\nParliament. Lastly, neither the court of Aldermen nor the court of Common\r\nCouncil ought to have power to draw upon the Chamber for a sum exceeding\r\n£500, except it were in connection with the re-building of the Guildhall\r\nand other specified objects. These and other recommendations of the\r\ncommittee, being carefully considered by the court, were for the most part\r\naccepted with certain amendments.\r\n\r\n(M695)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there was due to the city’s Chamber no less a sum than\r\n£77,409 6_s._ 6_d._ for principal and interest on former loans to the\r\nking. This sum Alderman Backwell undertook himself to pay to the City,\r\naccepting a transfer of the Treasury Bills in the hands of the City\r\nChamberlain. The Common Council was only too ready to accept the\r\noffer.(1381) Edward Backwell, alderman of Bishopsgate Ward, was one of\r\nthose city princes whose wealth brought them into close relation with the\r\nCrown. A goldsmith by trade, he, like others of his class, took to keeping\r\n\"running cashes\" and transacting generally the business of a banker at his\r\nhouse known as the \"Unicorn\" in Lombard Street. Pepys mentions him\r\nfrequently in his Diary. In the days of the Commonwealth he was paymaster\r\nof the garrison at Dunkirk, and continued to act as financial agent in all\r\nmatters connected with that town until it was sold to the French king. His\r\nhouse in Lombard Street having perished in the Great Fire, he was, by the\r\nking’s special command, accommodated with lodgings in Gresham College, in\r\norder that his business relations with the king might not be interrupted\r\npending the re-building of his premises.(1382)\r\n\r\n(M696)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1669, a riot occurred in the Temple on the occasion of the mayor\r\nand aldermen going to dine with the reader of the Inner Temple. The\r\nquestion whether the Temple is situate within the city and liberties or\r\nnot was then a debateable one, whatever it may be at the present day. The\r\nlord mayor of that time (William Turner) evidently thought that it lay\r\nwithin his jurisdiction, and insisted upon being preceded by the city’s\r\nsword-bearer carrying the sword up. To this the students strongly\r\nobjected. The story, as told by Pepys, is to the effect that on Wednesday,\r\n3rd March, \"my lord mayor being invited this day to dinner at the readers\r\nat the Temple, and endeavouring to carry his sword up, the students did\r\npull it down, and forced him to go and stay all the day in a private\r\ncounsellor’s chamber until the reader himself could get the young\r\ngentlemen to dinner; and then my lord mayor did retreat out of the Temple\r\nby stealth with his sword up. This do make great heat among the students,\r\nand my lord mayor did send to the king, and also I hear that Sir Richard\r\nBrowne did cause the drums to beat for the trained bands; but all is over,\r\nonly I hear that the students do resolve to try the charter of the city.\"\r\nFrom a draft report(1383) of the incident which was probably made for the\r\npurpose of being laid before the Council Board,(1384) we learn that as\r\nsoon as the civic procession entered the Temple cloisters it was met by a\r\nman named Hodges and others coming down the back stairs of the Inner\r\nTemple Hall; that Hodges threatened the lord mayor if he would not take\r\ndown his sword, declaring that the Temple was excepted out of the city’s\r\ncharter, that the sword was not the king’s sword, but the lord mayor’s,\r\nand that \"they were as good men as he, and no respect was to be given him\r\nthere.\" A struggle then took place for the possession of the sword, in\r\nwhich the sword-bearer was slightly hurt and some of the pearls from the\r\nscabbard were lost. The students made a snatch at the \"cap of maintenance\"\r\nworn by the sword-bearer. The marshal’s men who were in attendance\r\nsuffered some rough treatment, and narrowly escaped being put under the\r\npump. The mayor and aldermen in the meanwhile sought refuge in the\r\nchambers of Mr. Auditor Phillips, and awaited the return of Sir John\r\nNicholas, who with the recorder and the sheriffs had been despatched to\r\nWhitehall to report the matter to the king. As soon as they returned the\r\nmayor and aldermen essayed to make their way out of the Temple, but were\r\nagain opposed by the students, with Hodges at their head. The scene was\r\none of wild excitement and confusion; blows were showered upon the\r\naldermen, and one of the sheriffs was seized by the collar in the frantic\r\nattempts of the students to pull down the sword. The mayor and aldermen\r\nwere called \"cuckolds,\" and their officers \"dogs, rogues, rascals and\r\nother very bad names.\" Some of the students are said to have had weapons\r\nconcealed under their gowns, and to have threatened to draw them. The\r\nsheriffs, the recorder and Sir John Nicholas having again been sent to the\r\nking, it was intimated to the mayor by some of the benchers, and by Mr.\r\nGoodfellow, the Reader, at whose invitation the civic fathers were in the\r\nTemple, that he might now leave without any interruption (the \"young\r\ngentlemen,\" according to Pepys, had been persuaded to go to dinner),\r\nwhich, after some display of opposition, he was allowed to do. Such is the\r\nCity’s own version of the affair, which concludes with the remark \"that\r\nthe proceedings aforesaid were greatly affrontive and dishonourable to the\r\ngovernment of the city,\" a remark with which most people will be disposed\r\nto agree. Nor is it surprising to find that two years later the mayor and\r\naldermen declined a similar invitation from Sir Francis North to attend\r\nhis \"feast\" at the Temple, more especially as another disturbance was\r\nthreatened if the sword should be borne up before his lordship.(1385)\r\n\r\n(M697)\r\n\r\nIn July, 1670—at a time when the City could ill afford to part with\r\nmoney—the king sent to borrow £60,000.(1386) He had recently entered into\r\na secret treaty with France (1 June), whereby he had pledged himself to\r\nassist the French king in subjugating Holland, in return for pecuniary\r\nsupport. The City agreed to advance the money, but in order to raise the\r\nsum required it became necessary to draw upon the coal dues.(1387) Much\r\nopposition was raised to the loan by the inhabitants,(1388) so that in\r\nNovember it became necessary for the city Chamberlain to borrow at\r\ninterest more than £1,000 to complete the loan.(1389) In addition to the\r\nloan by the City Charles obtained considerable supplies from parliament\r\nwhen it met in the autumn. The House had been kept in complete ignorance\r\nof the arrangement that had been made with France, and voted the money on\r\nthe understanding that it would be used in assisting the Dutch against\r\nLouis and not Louis against the Dutch.\r\n\r\n(M698)\r\n\r\nIn order to keep up the illusion Charles treated the Prince of Orange\r\n(afterwards William III of England), who was on a visit to this country at\r\nthe time, with the highest consideration and insisted on the lord mayor\r\ngiving \"hand and place\" to his foreign guest (contrary to city custom) at\r\nan entertainment given by the City in the prince’s honour.(1390)\r\n\r\n(M699)\r\n\r\nAs soon as parliament had voted supplies it was prorogued (11 Dec.),\r\nCharles and his \"cabal\" being determined to have no restraint put upon\r\nthem in carrying out the terms of the shameful treaty with France. No long\r\ntime elapsed before they had to face the difficulty of an empty exchequer.\r\nIt was useless to declare war without funds. Charles was at his wits’ end\r\nfor money and promised high office to any one who should point out a\r\nsuccessful way of raising it. Clifford and Ashley, two members of the\r\ncabal, put their heads together and hit upon the bold plan of declaring a\r\n_moratorium_, or suspension of payments out of the royal exchequer. For\r\nmany years past it had been the custom for the goldsmiths of London and\r\nothers who had been in the habit of keeping the money of private\r\nindividuals, either on deposit or running account, to lend it to the king,\r\nwho could afford to pay them a higher rate of interest than they paid to\r\ntheir private customers. The money was paid into the exchequer, the\r\nbankers taking assignments of the public revenue for payment of principal\r\nand interest, as it came in. Most of this money had already been spent by\r\nCharles in paying off the fleet that brought him over, and in carrying on\r\nthe late war with the Dutch;(1391) but the bankers and capitalists who had\r\nprovided the money were content to abide by the king’s frequent assurance\r\nthat he would continue to make good all assignments until their whole debt\r\nshould be wiped out. We may judge therefore of their surprise and\r\ndisappointment when they learnt, as they did on the 2nd January, 1672,\r\nthat the king proposed to suspend all payments out of the public revenue\r\nfor one whole year!\r\n\r\n(M700)\r\n\r\nIt is true that he promised to add the interest then due to the capital\r\nand to allow six per cent. interest on the whole as some compensation to\r\nhis creditors for the delay; but this, even if carried into practice,\r\nproved unavailing to ward off disaster. The inevitable crash came. Many of\r\nthe London bankers, and among them Alderman Backwell, who held revenue\r\nassignments exceeding a quarter of a million sterling, were made utterly\r\nbankrupt. A few of them who had interest at court got wind of the\r\nthreatened danger and managed to withdraw their money from the exchequer\r\nin time, whilst Shaftesbury, one of the prime movers in closing the\r\nexchequer, foreseeing the inevitable result, took all of his own money out\r\nof his banker’s hands and warned his friends to do the same.\r\n\r\n(M701)\r\n\r\nThe exchequer having been in this way made richer by £1,300,000, Charles\r\nwas prepared to declare war. An attempt to intercept a fleet of Dutch\r\nmerchantmen before any declaration of war had been made—a piratical act\r\nadmitting of no possible justification—brought matters to a climax and war\r\nwas declared (17 March, 1672) by England and France. The 27th March was\r\nappointed by royal proclamation to be kept as a solemn fast for the\r\npurpose of begging the Almighty’s blessing on his majesty’s forces, the\r\nsame prayers being used as had been specially ordained for the late\r\nwar.(1392)\r\n\r\n(M702)\r\n\r\nThe war, which was chiefly remarkable for the noble stand made by the\r\nDutch under the young William, Prince of Orange, Charles’s own nephew and\r\nafterwards King of England, soon drained the king’s resources, and once\r\nmore he had to face a parliament. The parliament, which met on the 4th\r\nFebruary, 1673, showed itself willing to vote a subsidy of £70,000 a month\r\nfor a period of eighteen months, but only on its own terms. These were (1)\r\nthe repeal of the Declaration of Indulgence which Charles, who was\r\nbeginning to show signs of favouring the Roman Church, had by a stretch of\r\nprerogative recently caused to be issued, and (2) the passing of a Test\r\nAct which should bind all public officers to take the oaths of supremacy\r\nand allegiance, receive the sacrament, and abjure the doctrine of\r\ntransubstantiation. By this means parliament hoped to maintain the\r\nsupremacy of the Church.\r\n\r\n(M703)\r\n\r\nThe assessments which the City was now called upon to pay were far beyond\r\nits powers, seeing that many merchants and traders who had left the city\r\nat the time of the Plague and Fire refused to return, preferring to live\r\nin the suburbs, and thus a large number of the houses that had recently\r\nbeen re-built were left unoccupied. Every exertion was made to get some\r\nremission of the burden, but although the king signified his intention of\r\nmaking some abatement, little appears to have been done.(1393)\r\n\r\n(M704)\r\n\r\nIn March of this year (1673) an individual named Philip De Cardonel came\r\nforward with a scheme for raising money by way of annuities to be granted\r\nby the city to every subscriber of £20 or more.(1394) The matter was in\r\nthe first instance brought before the Court of Aldermen, who, upon\r\nconsideration, declared that the proposal appeared to them \"very faire and\r\nreasonable, and in all likelihood of very great advantage to the city,\"\r\nand forthwith resolved themselves into a committee of the whole court to\r\ntreat with Cardonel and take such further proceedings as might be thought\r\nrequisite.(1395) In the following month (11 April) the same proposals were\r\nsubmitted to the Common Council, where they met with similar favour. The\r\ncourt also appointed a committee to take them into further consideration,\r\npromising in the meantime that no advantage should be taken or benefit\r\nderived from the scheme without the special leave and consent of the\r\nproposer.(1396) Although the committee reported favourably on the\r\nscheme(1397) it was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\n(M705)\r\n\r\nBy February of the next year (1674) trade had become so bad that a number\r\nof the inhabitants of the city petitioned the Common Council (13 Feb.) to\r\nseek some relief from parliament. An address was accordingly drawn up,\r\nsetting forth the miserable state to which the city had been reduced by\r\nthe ravages of the plague and the fire, the increase of new buildings in\r\nthe suburbs, which not only injured the trade of the city, but afforded a\r\nretreat for disorderly persons, and excessive taxation (the city being\r\ncalled upon to pay the same amount of taxes as in its most prosperous\r\ndays), and praying the Commons to apply some timely remedy. The address\r\nwas to have been laid before the house on Monday, the 23rd February,(1398)\r\nbut no mention of it appears in the Commons Journal. On the 24th the House\r\nwas prorogued.\r\n\r\n(M706)\r\n\r\nIn September (1674) the old question again cropt up as to the power of the\r\nCourt of Aldermen to veto matters ordained by the Common Council. The\r\nquestion had arisen, it will be remembered, in January, 1649,(1399) when\r\nReynardson, the mayor, got up and left the Common Council, followed by the\r\naldermen, and the court, instead of breaking up according to custom,\r\nproceeded to pass measures in their absence. Its action on this occasion\r\nwas reported to parliament, and the house signified its approval of the\r\ncourt’s proceedings and passed an ordinance which practically deprived the\r\nCourt of Aldermen of all control over the Common Council. Since that time\r\nthe matter had remained dormant, until jealousy between the two bodies was\r\nagain excited by the Common Council passing an Act (17 Sept., 1674) for\r\ncompelling the aldermen to reside within the city under the penalty of a\r\nfine of £500.(1400) Against the passing of any such Act the Recorder, on\r\nbehalf of the Court of Aldermen, formally reported their protest to the\r\nCommon Council, and the Commons as formerly protested against that protest\r\n(13 Nov.).(1401)\r\n\r\nIt was not that the mayor and aldermen were not fully conscious of the\r\nmischief arising from their own non-residence in the city, for they\r\nthemselves passed an order for every alderman to return with his family\r\ninto the city before the following Easter on pain of heavy penalty,(1402)\r\nbut they objected to the court of Common Council presuming to dictate to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n(M707)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Court of Aldermen had appointed a committee (24 Sept.)\r\nto examine the question of the right of veto, and this committee had\r\nreported (20 Oct.) in favour of the court.(1403) \"We find,\" said the\r\ncommittee, \"that the court of Common Council hath always consisted, and\r\nstill it doth, of three distinct degrees of persons, viz., of the lord\r\nmayor in the first place as the chefe magistrate, and secondly of the\r\naldermen as subordinate magistrates, and thirdly of the commons, or of a\r\nselect number of the commons representing all the commoners of the said\r\ncity as now is, and for a long time before hath been used.\" In this\r\nrespect the committee proceeded to say, \"the Common Councill of the city\r\ndoth much resemble the constitution of the Common Council of the kingdom,\r\nand we further find that the order of proceeding in the making of lawes\r\nfor the good government of the citty doth imitate the paterne sett them by\r\nthe High Court of Parliament, in making lawes for the government of the\r\nnation, in regard that noe ordinance made in the Common Councell of this\r\ncity can be a binding law to any without the joint consent and concurrence\r\nof the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen and commoners in Common Councell\r\nassembled, they having a joynt power and equal authority in making of\r\nlawes. So that the mayor and aldermen cannot impose upon the commoners,\r\nnor _e converso_; each degree having a power to dissent or assent as to\r\nthem seems best.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee next pointed out how Bills for the better government of the\r\ncity had formerly originated for the most part with the mayor and\r\naldermen, and had been by them transmitted to the Common Council, where,\r\nafter being read in two several courts (and not twice in one court) and\r\nassented to, they became complete acts and binding laws. Such had been the\r\nusual and salient practice. Nevertheless, the committee had found that\r\nsometimes the Common Council had petitioned the Court of Aldermen for\r\nredress of certain grievances and the latter had complied with such\r\npetitions, \"and so sometimes Acts of Common Council have been made at the\r\ndesire of the lord mayor and aldermen signifyed to the commons by the\r\nRecorder.\" The conclusion that the committee arrived at was that \"the lord\r\nmayor and aldermen have negative votes as the commoners also have, and\r\ncontrary to this order of proceeding in making Acts of Common Council wee\r\ncannot find any presedent.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th November a joint Committee of Aldermen and Commoners was\r\nappointed by the Common Council to search the city’s Records as to \"the\r\nrespective privileges of the lord mayor and aldermen and of the commons in\r\nCommon Council assembled, and of the most ancient and decent method in\r\nmaking laws within this citty,\" and to report thereon.(1404) Four days\r\nlater (17 Nov.) the Court of Aldermen instructed their committee to make\r\nfurther search on the question.(1405)\r\n\r\n(M708) (M709)\r\n\r\nMatters were brought to a crisis on the 12th March, 1675, when the mayor\r\nand aldermen, dissatisfied with the proceedings of the court of Common\r\nCouncil, got up and left the court. The Common Sergeant—the notorious\r\nGeorge Jeffreys—refusing to follow the example set by the Common Sergeant\r\nin 1649, remained behind, and went so far as to put a question to the\r\ncourt of which the mayor and aldermen had previously disapproved. For this\r\nhe was shortly afterwards called to account. His defence was that he only\r\nobeyed the wishes of the majority; but this being deemed unsatisfactory,\r\nthe Court of Aldermen ordered him to be suspended from office.(1406)\r\n\r\n(M710) (M711)\r\n\r\nHe afterwards (23 March) offered an apology to the Court of Aldermen for\r\nhis conduct, confessing \"that the question by him put at the last Common\r\nCouncil after the lord mayor was out of the chair was altogether\r\nirregular,\" and asked pardon. His apology, so far as it went, was accepted\r\nin good part by the court, but upon some explanation being asked of him as\r\nto his not refusing to put a question when commanded to refuse, and his\r\noffering to put another question at the request of some members of the\r\ncouncil, he desired to be allowed time before he made answer.(1407)\r\nMeanwhile the dispute between the Aldermen and Common Council had been\r\nbrought to the notice of the king,(1408) who, with his brother the Duke of\r\nYork, had recently received the freedom of the City.(1409)\r\n\r\n(M712) (M713)\r\n\r\nA week later (30 March) the Recorder, John Howell, reported to the Court\r\nof Aldermen(1410) that he and the Common Sergeant had by command appeared\r\nbefore his majesty the previous day touching the unhappy difference\r\nexisting between the Aldermen and the Common Council; that the Common\r\nSergeant being asked to whom it devolved to put the question on a debate\r\nin council, had in the Recorder’s hearing replied to the effect \"that the\r\nquestion had always been used to be put by the lord mayor or by his\r\nlordship’s appointment and not otherwise, so far as he had observed,\" and\r\nhe had never known the matter disputed; that he had then likewise declared\r\nto his majesty that he was \"sorry for his deportment at the last Common\r\nCouncil, saying that what he did was a sudden act and rashly done without\r\nany intention to make any disturbance, and that he would freely\r\nacknowledge the same wheresoever his majesty should command him\"; that\r\ntherefore his majesty had commanded the Recorder to acquaint the court\r\nthat the best expedient he could suggest, as the case stood, for a\r\nsettlement of the difficulty, was that the old order of things should be\r\nre-established, that (among other things) the suspension of the Common\r\nSergeant should be removed, and that the books and records of the city\r\nshould be searched by six such aldermen as the lord mayor should appoint,\r\nand six such commoners as the Common Council should appoint, in order to\r\nsatisfy themselves of the respective privileges of the lord mayor and\r\naldermen and commons in Common Council assembled, and to settle the same\r\nin a quiet and peaceable manner if they could. Failing this his majesty\r\nwould appoint a judge to arbitrate in the matter.\r\n\r\n(M714)\r\n\r\nThe court followed the king’s suggestion so far as related to the Common\r\nSergeant, and having listened to his expressions of regret for his late\r\nconduct, and his assurances that he would always endeavour to \"promote the\r\nhonour and government of the city,\" it removed his suspension.\r\n\r\n(M715)\r\n\r\nAs regards the real issue between the two Courts of Aldermen and Common\r\nCouncil, matters remained much as they were before. Although the Court of\r\nAldermen gave orders (12 April) that the proceedings relative to the\r\ndispute between the two courts should be faithfully recorded, the minutes\r\nof the Common Council at this period are particularly lacking in\r\ninformation as well on this as on other matters in which the City was\r\nconcerned.(1411)\r\n\r\n(M716)\r\n\r\nOne result of the _contretemps_ which had occurred in the court of Common\r\nCouncil of the 12th March was that the Court of Aldermen resolved to\r\nretain certain counsel to advise them as occasion should arise on the\r\nquestion of their rights and privileges, and to create a fund by\r\nsubscription among themselves to meet the necessary expenses.(1412)\r\n\r\n(M717)\r\n\r\nIn April the Town Clerk and the four clerks of the outer court (_i.e._\r\nmayor’s court) were instructed to search the books and records of the city\r\non the question whether or not it was the province of the lord mayor (1)\r\nto direct and put the question in the Common Council, (2) to name\r\ncommittees, and (3) to nominate persons to be put in election to any\r\noffice.(1413) This last point especially affected the right claimed by the\r\nmayor to nominate (if not to elect) one of the sheriffs by virtue of his\r\nprerogative—a claim which had already been more than once canvassed and\r\nwhich was destined shortly to bring the City and the Crown into violent\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n(M718)\r\n\r\nOn the 7th September, 1675, the Court of Aldermen directed that the\r\nopinion of counsel should be taken on the power of the mayor and aldermen\r\nto put their veto on matters passed by the Common Council.(1414) After the\r\nlapse of fifteen months the opinions of Sir William Jones, the\r\nattorney-general, Sir Francis Winnington, solicitor-general, Sir John\r\nMaynard and Sir Francis Pemberton, sergeants-at-law, and of \"Mr. William\r\nSteele\" (_not_ a former Recorder of that name as some have supposed(1415))\r\nwere presented to the court (5 Dec., 1676);(1416) and with the exception\r\nof the last mentioned, all the lawyers declared in favour of the mayor and\r\naldermen. There the matter was allowed to rest for a year or more until in\r\nFebruary, 1678, the opinions of Sir William Dolben, not long since\r\nappointed the city’s Recorder, and of Jeffreys, the Common Sergeant, who\r\nwas destined in a few months to succeed Dolben on the latter’s promotion\r\nto the bench, were taken and found to coincide with the opinions already\r\ndelivered with the exception of that of William Steele.(1417)\r\n\r\n(M719) (M720) (M721) (M722)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Charles had concluded a separate treaty with the Dutch (19\r\nFeb., 1674), who continued to struggle manfully against the French king,\r\nwith such assistance as they derived from the emperor and the German\r\nstates. The Commons were fearful of entrusting the king with either money\r\nor troops lest he should employ them against the Dutch, or against their\r\nown liberties. The successes of Louis at length provoked a general cry for\r\nwar against France, and the Commons went so far as to pass a bill (8\r\nMarch, 1678) imposing a poll tax as part of the supply.(1418) Charles lost\r\nno time in applying to the City for the sum of £100,000 on the security of\r\nthis tax, and the court of Common Council signified its readiness to\r\nadvance the money (9 April).(1419) Finding that parliament hesitated to\r\nfurnish the supplies it had voted, and without which he assured the\r\nmembers he would have to lay up the fleet and disband some of the newly\r\nraised forces, Charles applied to the City for another £50,000. This, too,\r\nwas granted (14 May);(1420) and Charles, in order to show his displeasure\r\nwith the Commons, resorted to his usual tactics and prorogued parliament,\r\nbut only for ten days.(1421) A few days after the Commons had again met\r\nthey resolved (27 May) that if the king would declare war against France\r\nthey would give him their hearty support, otherwise they would at once\r\nproceed to take into consideration the speedy disbandment of the\r\narmy.(1422) The king refusing to declare war, parliament proceeded (4\r\nJune) to carry out its threat and voted the sum of £200,000 for the\r\ndisbandment of all the forces that had been raised since the 29th\r\nSeptember, 1677.(1423) The disbandment did not take place, however, but in\r\nits stead a force was despatched to Holland. Scarcely had it arrived\r\nbefore the peace of Nimeguen was signed.\r\n\r\n(M723)\r\n\r\nJust when the war was brought so unexpectedly to an end Charles signified\r\nhis desire for another loan by the City to the extent of £200,000. The\r\nmatter was brought to the notice of the Common Council on the last day of\r\nJuly, and on the 1st August the lord mayor issued his precept to the\r\naldermen of the several wards to invite subscriptions.(1424) For what\r\npurpose the money was required we are not told. It was generally feared\r\nthat the king meditated a suppression of the liberties of his subjects by\r\nthe introduction of foreign troops. This fear was enhanced by the\r\nknowledge that if Charles died the crown would fall to his brother, an\r\nuncompromising Catholic. The public mind became so unhinged that every\r\nbreath or rumour created the greatest trepidation. Within a fortnight\r\nafter the City had signified its assent to the last loan the nation was\r\nsuddenly surprised by some words let drop by Dr. Tonge, the weak and\r\ncredulous rector of St. Michael’s, Wood Street, and the tool of the\r\ninfamous Titus Oates. A Popish plot was, he said, on foot and the king’s\r\nlife in danger, in proof of which he produced documentary evidence. Oates,\r\nthe prime mover in starting the idea of a plot, was ready in the most\r\nshameless way with depositions to corroborate all that Tonge had said.\r\nThese depositions he made before a Middlesex magistrate, Sir Edmondesbury\r\nGodfrey. The next morning Godfrey’s corpse was found lying in a ditch near\r\nPrimrose Hill. All London was wild with excitement and jumped to the\r\nconclusion that the Middlesex Justice had met a violent death for\r\nlistening to Oates’s evidence, although there is reason for believing him\r\nto have fallen by his own hands. The cry against Papists continued\r\nunabated for years.(1425) The city presented the appearance of a state of\r\nsiege with its gates kept closed, its streets protected with posts and\r\nchains, and an armed watch kept by night and day.(1426) In October, when\r\naccording to custom the king was to be invited to the lord mayor’s\r\nbanquet, the Recorder was instructed to congratulate his majesty upon his\r\nrecent escape and to make arrangements for a deputation to wait upon him\r\nin person.(1427)\r\n\r\n(M724)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met on the 21st of this month it passed a new Test Act\r\nrigidly excluding all Catholics from both Houses. Five Catholic peers were\r\ncommitted to the Tower, and Coleman, the secretary of the Duchess of York,\r\nwas tried and executed for having in his possession papers betraying a\r\ndesign for forcing the Roman Catholic religion on the nation. It next\r\nproceeded to impeach Danby for having been concerned in certain money\r\ntransactions between Charles and the king of France. Knowing the danger\r\nlikely to arise from such an investigation, Charles dissolved (24 Jan.,\r\n1679) the parliament, which had now sat for more than seventeen years.\r\n\r\n(M725)\r\n\r\nWhen the elections for the new parliament were over it was found that the\r\nopposition to the king was greater than ever. Of the city members who had\r\nsat in the last parliament only one—Alderman Love—was returned, the\r\nremaining seats being taken by Alderman Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Thomas\r\nPlayer, the city chamberlain, and Thomas Pilkington, afterwards elected\r\nalderman of the ward of Farringdon Without. This second parliament—the\r\nfirst of a series of short parliaments—in Charles’s reign met on the 6th\r\nMarch, 1679, but was suddenly dissolved on the 27th May in order to stop\r\nthe progress of an Exclusion Bill depriving the Duke of York of his right\r\nof succession to the crown.(1428) It left its mark, however, on the\r\nstatute book by passing the Habeas Corpus Act. It also voted a sum\r\nexceeding £200,000 for disbandment of the forces raised since Michaelmas,\r\n1677.(1429) Just a week before parliament dissolved the Court of Aldermen\r\nwas asked (20 May) to forward an address thanking both Houses for their\r\ncare in securing the personal safety of the king and maintaining the\r\nProtestant religion. The address was referred back in order to include the\r\nking in the vote of thanks, and was then submitted (23 May) to the Common\r\nCouncil for approval. That body made a further amendment by adding the\r\nwords: \"The Protestant religion according to the doctrine and discipline\r\nof the Church of England as it is now established by law.\"(1430)\r\n\r\n(M726)\r\n\r\nIn August the king was confined to his bed with a fever so violent that it\r\nwas deemed advisable to send for his brother the Duke of York. He\r\nrecovered however; and on the 11th September a deputation of city aldermen\r\nwaited on him to learn when the court might come in person to congratulate\r\nhim on his convalescence.(1431) On the 17th the mayor issued his precept\r\nfor bells to be set ringing and bonfires to be lighted in the city in\r\nhonour of his majesty’s return from Windsor to Whitehall after his late\r\nindisposition.(1432) The Duke of York did not return to England until\r\nFebruary, 1680, when a special Court of Aldermen sat to make arrangements\r\nfor presenting their congratulations to him and the duchess.(1433)\r\n\r\n(M727)\r\n\r\nThe elections for a fresh parliament which had taken place in the meantime\r\nhaving gone against the court party, parliament no sooner met (17 Oct.)\r\nthan it was prorogued; and in consequence of repeated prorogations never\r\nsat again for a whole twelvemonth (21 Oct., 1680).(1434) Nor would it in\r\nall probability have been allowed to meet even then, had it not been for a\r\nconstant succession of petitions addressed to the king insisting upon a\r\nsession being held. So annoyed was Charles with this demonstration of\r\npopular feeling in favour of parliament that he issued a proclamation (12\r\nDec., 1679) prohibiting such \"tumultuous petitions.\"(1435)\r\n\r\n(M728)\r\n\r\nThis led to the presentation of a number of counter-addresses to the king,\r\nexpressing the greatest confidence in his majesty’s wisdom, the most\r\ndutiful submission to his prerogative, and _abhorrence_ of those who had\r\ndared to encroach upon it by petitions. The two parties thus became\r\ndistinguished as _Petitioners_ and _Abhorrers_; names which were\r\nsubsequently replaced by Whigs and Tories.\r\n\r\n(M729)\r\n\r\nThe citizens were _Petitioners_. On the 29th July (1680) the Livery\r\nassembled in Common Hall for the election of sheriffs took the opportunity\r\nof desiring Sir Robert Clayton, the lord mayor, to beseech his majesty on\r\ntheir behalf, that for the preservation of his royal person and government\r\nand the Protestant religion he would graciously please to order that\r\nparliament, his great council, might assemble and sit to take measures\r\nagainst the machinations of Rome.(1436) Clayton showed himself very\r\nwilling to comply with the wishes of Common Hall, but pointed out at the\r\nsame time that he had reason to believe that parliament was to meet in\r\nNovember. \"If that be so,\" said he, \"I hope your great concern for that\r\nmatter might have been spared, being anticipated by his majesties gracious\r\nintention. However, I shall not be wanting with all humility to lay the\r\nwhole matter before him.\" In spite of Jeffreys, the Recorder, having ruled\r\nthat such a petition bordered on treason, and in spite of a warning\r\nreceived from the lord chancellor, Clayton insisted on presenting a\r\npetition, and for doing so was rewarded with the grateful thanks of the\r\nCommon Council on his quitting the mayoralty.(1437) Jeffreys on the other\r\nhand was compelled to resign the recordership.(1438)\r\n\r\n(M730) (M731)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament was at last allowed to meet the City lost no time in\r\npresenting a dutiful address(1439) to Charles acknowledging his majesty’s\r\nfavour and their own satisfaction. They besought him to lend a ready ear\r\nto the humble advice tendered by his great council for the safety of his\r\nroyal person and the preservation of the true Protestant religion, and\r\npromised to be ready at all times to promote his majesty’s ease and\r\nprosperity, and to stand by him against all dangers and hazards\r\nwhatsoever. Had Charles accepted this address in the spirit with which it\r\nwas made matters might have gone better with him, and the Stuart family\r\nmight never have been driven from the throne; but he was in no mood to\r\naccept advice either from parliament or the city, and the only answer he\r\nvouchsafed to the citizens was to tell them to mind their own business. He\r\nknew what he had to do, without their advice.(1440)\r\n\r\n(M732)\r\n\r\nAs soon as the House met it commenced an attack upon Papists. The\r\nExclusion Bill was again passed, but was thrown out by the Lords. Thus\r\nbaulked the Commons revived the impeachment of the Catholic lords. During\r\nthe trial of Stafford on a charge of a design to murder the king, more\r\nthan ordinary precautions had to be taken by the mayor to maintain order\r\nand prevent too great a crowd assembling at Westminster.(1441) Being\r\ncondemned to death, the king was ready to spare Stafford the grosser\r\nindignities attached to a felon’s execution, but the royal act of clemency\r\nwas not allowed to pass unchallenged by the sheriffs of London on the\r\nground that if the king could dispense with some part of the execution why\r\nnot of all?(1442) The House had passed a vote of thanks to the City for\r\nits \"manifest loyalty to the king\" and its care and vigilance for the\r\npreservation of his majesty’s person and of the Protestant religion, and\r\nhad got as far as the second reading of a Bill for repealing the\r\nCorporation Act of 1661 when it found itself suddenly prorogued from the\r\n10th January to the 20th.(1443)\r\n\r\n(M733)\r\n\r\nDuring the interval a petition was drawn up by the Common Council (13\r\nJan.) and presented to the king, in which the petitioners expressed their\r\nsurprise at the late prorogation \"whereby the prosecution of the public\r\njustice of the kingdom ... have received an interruption,\" and after\r\nreferring to the action taken by parliament for the defence of his\r\nmajesty’s person and the preservation of the Protestant religion, prayed\r\nthat the House might be allowed to resume its session on the day to which\r\nparliament had been prorogued as being \"the only means to quiet the minds\r\nand extinguish the fears of your Protestant subjects.\"(1444) This\r\npetition, and more especially that part of it which spoke of the\r\ninterruption of justice, was highly resented by Charles, and was one of\r\nthe causes which led to the issue of the writ of _Quo Warranto_ against\r\nthe city in the following year. In the meanwhile it served only to make\r\nthe king more determined than ever to dissolve the parliament, which he\r\ndid by proclamation on the 18th January. A new parliament was summoned for\r\nthe 21st March; it was not however to sit in London, but in the royalist\r\ncity of Oxford.(1445)\r\n\r\n(M734)\r\n\r\nThe City sent up to Oxford the same members that had represented them in\r\nthe last two parliaments. The election took place at a Common Hall held on\r\nFriday the 4th February, but no record of the proceedings is to be found\r\nin the city’s archives.(1446) From other sources, however,(1447) we learn\r\nthat after an opening speech by one of the secondaries, or under-sheriffs,\r\nHenry Cornish, one of the sheriffs, addressed the meeting and explained\r\nhow the mayor (Sir Patience Ward) had been asked to allow himself to be\r\nput in nomination but had declined. One or two aldermen were nominated for\r\nform’s sake, but the choice of the citizens was unanimously in favour of\r\nthe old members—Sir Robert Clayton, Alderman Pilkington, Sir Thomas\r\nPlayer, the city chamberlain, and William Love. The election over, the\r\nCommon Hall presented an address to the members, acknowledging their past\r\nservices and promising to support them in their determination to grant no\r\nmoney supply until they had effectually secured the city against Popery\r\nand arbitrary power. To this address Sir Robert Clayton made a brief\r\nreply, promising, on behalf of himself and colleagues, to continue their\r\nendeavours to attain the ends desired. The fact that the new parliament\r\nwas to sit at Oxford, a stronghold of the Tory party, caused no little\r\nalarm, and this alarm was increased when it became known that Charles was\r\nbringing his own guards with him. The city’s representatives were brought\r\non their way by a large number of followers with ribbons in their hats\r\nbearing the words \"No Popery! No Slavery!\" whilst Shaftesbury and his\r\nsupporters made no disguise that they were well equipt with arms.(1448)\r\n\r\n(M735)\r\n\r\nCharles soon perceived that he had little to gain from the new parliament,\r\nwhich insisted on having its own way, and refused even the king’s\r\nhumiliating proposal to place the government of the country after his\r\ndemise in the hands of a regent, leaving the bare title of king to his\r\nbrother, the Duke of York. It caused an impeachment to be laid against an\r\nIrishman named Fitzharris whom Charles had recently removed from Newgate\r\nto the Tower in order to prevent the civic authorities taking the\r\nprisoner’s depositions,(1449) and it otherwise proved so uncompromising\r\nthat at the end of a week (28 March) it was sent about its business.\r\nCharles afterwards (8 April) published a \"declaration\" of his reasons for\r\ntaking that course.(1450)\r\n\r\n(M736)\r\n\r\nOn the 13th May the Common Council passed a vote of thanks to the city\r\nmembers for their faithful services in the last three parliaments, and\r\nmore especially in the late parliament at Oxford. It also agreed by a\r\nnarrow majority of fourteen to present an address to the king praying him\r\nto cause a parliament to meet and continue to sit until due provision be\r\nmade for the security of his majesty’s person and his people.(1451) The\r\nfirst attempt (13 May) to present this address failed, the deputation\r\nbeing told to meet the king at Hampton Court another day (19 May). When it\r\nwas presented the deputation were told to go home and mind their own\r\nbusiness. Other addresses—one from the lieutenancy of London and another\r\nfrom the borough of Southwark—presented the same day, in which thanks were\r\ntendered to his majesty for dissolving the last two parliaments, met with\r\na very different reception. Undismayed at the rebuff thus administered to\r\nthe City, the Grand Jury at the Old Bailey passed a vote of thanks (20\r\nMay) to the mayor for the part he had taken in presenting the address, and\r\nordered a similar address to that of the City to be presented to Charles\r\non their own account.(1452)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M737)\r\n\r\nThe country seemed to be on the verge of another civil war. A re-action,\r\nhowever, in favour of the king set in. The nation began to view the\r\nsituation more dispassionately and to entertain serious doubts whether\r\nparliament had acted rightly in pushing matters to such an extremity. The\r\nreligious question after all might not be so important or so fraught with\r\ndanger as they had been led to believe by professional informers.\r\nAddresses of the type of those presented by the lieutenancy of London and\r\nthe borough of Southwark, among them being one signed by over twenty\r\nthousand apprentices of the city,(1453) began to flow in; and proceedings\r\nwere commenced against Protestants on no better evidence than had\r\npreviously been used against Catholics.\r\n\r\n(M738)\r\n\r\nAmong the first against whom proceedings were taken was a Londoner named\r\nStephen College, a joiner by trade, who from his zeal in the cause of\r\nreligion came to be known as the \"Protestant joiner.\" An attempt to get a\r\ntrue bill returned against him at the Old Bailey, where the juries were\r\nempanelled by the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, having failed, he was\r\nremoved to Oxford and tried there on a charge of high treason. After much\r\nhard swearing a verdict was at length obtained.(1454)\r\n\r\n(M739)\r\n\r\nHaving secured the conviction of College the council flew at higher game\r\nin the person of the Earl of Shaftesbury. He was arrested at his house in\r\nAldersgate Street on the 2nd July, but it was not until November that a\r\nbill of high treason was preferred against him at the Old Bailey. The\r\nnomination of juries practically rested with the sheriffs, and the court\r\nparty had recently endeavoured to force the election of candidates of\r\ntheir own political complexion. In this they had failed, although in\r\nDecember last the king had endeavoured to change the character of city\r\njuries by ordering the mayor (Sir Patience Ward) to issue his precept to\r\nthe Aldermen to see that none were returned by their wards for service on\r\njuries \"of inferior degree than a subsidy man.\"(1455) The sheriffs for the\r\nyear, Thomas Pilkington and Samuel Shute, who were zealous Whigs, took\r\ncare to empanel a grand jury which would be inclined to ignore the bill\r\nagainst the earl, and under these circumstances the bill was thrown out\r\n(24 Nov.).(1456)\r\n\r\n(M740)\r\n\r\nThe failure of the court party to obtain a conviction of Shaftesbury owing\r\nto the political bias of the sheriffs for the time being, determined them\r\nto resort to more drastic measures to obtain the election of candidates\r\nwith Tory proclivities. In order to understand the method pursued it will\r\nbe necessary to review briefly the manner in which the election of\r\nsheriffs had from time to time been carried out.\r\n\r\n(M741)\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of which we have any city record until the\r\ncommencement of the 14th century it had been the custom for the sheriffs\r\nof London and Middlesex to be elected by the mayor, aldermen and \"the good\r\nmen of the city\" or \"commonalty.\" But a custom sprang up in 1301 of\r\nsummoning twelve men only from each ward to take part with the mayor and\r\naldermen in such elections,(1457) a custom which found little favour with\r\nthe bulk of the inhabitants of the city, who insisted upon being present\r\nand taking part in the proceedings. An attempt was made by the civic\r\nauthorities in 1313 to put a stop to the noise and confusion resulting\r\nfrom the presence of such vast numbers at the Guildhall by an order\r\nproviding that thenceforth only the best men from each ward should be\r\nsummoned to take part in the elections, and two years later (4 July, 1315)\r\nthis order was enforced by royal proclamation.(1458) Nevertheless the\r\npractice of summoning representatives from the wards was soon dropt, and\r\nfor more than thirty years the sheriffs continued to be elected by the\r\nmayor, aldermen and the \"whole commonalty.\" Another attempt (made under\r\nBrembre in 1384) to restrict the number of the commonalty to \"so many and\r\nsuch of them as should seem needful for the time\" (_tantz et tieux come\r\nlour semble busoignable pur le temps_)(1459) was not more successful.\r\n\r\n(M742)\r\n\r\nIn 1347 we meet for the first time with a new method of procedure. In that\r\nyear one of the sheriffs was elected by the mayor and the other by the\r\ncommonalty;(1460) and this prerogative of the mayor for the time being to\r\nelect one of the sheriffs continued to be exercised with few (if any)\r\nexceptions down to 1638. Neither in 1639 nor in the following year was the\r\nprerogative exercised. In 1641 the mayor attempted to exercise it, but\r\nthrough some negligence on his part was declared by the House of Commons\r\nto have forfeited his right, and the election of both sheriffs devolved,\r\n_pro hac vice_, upon the commonalty.(1461)\r\n\r\n(M743)\r\n\r\nFrom 1642 to 1651 the mayor for the time being exercised his prerogative\r\nin electing as well as nominating one of the sheriffs, but the commonalty\r\nalways challenged his right to elect, although they paid the mayor the\r\ncompliment of electing his nominee to serve with the sheriff of their own\r\nchoice. From 1652 to 1660 (or 1661(1462)?) the mayor did not attempt to\r\nexercise a right either of electing or nominating one of the sheriffs, but\r\nin 1662, when the mayor would have elected as well as nominated Thomas\r\nBludworth as sheriff, the commonalty claimed their rights. Bludworth was\r\neventually returned together with Sir William Turner.(1463)\r\n\r\n(M744)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1663) the prerogative exercised by the mayor passed\r\nunchallenged, and so continued until 1674, when, objection being\r\nraised,(1464) the Common Council appointed a committee \"to consider of the\r\nmatters in difference and now long debated in this court between ye right\r\nhonorable ye lord maior and commons of this citty concerneing the eleccon\r\nof one of ye sheriffes and to finde out some expedient for ye reconciling\r\nye same.\"(1465)\r\n\r\n(M745)\r\n\r\nWe now read for the first time in the City’s Records of a custom in\r\nconnection with the election of sheriffs (although that custom is said to\r\nhave arisen in the reign of Elizabeth),(1466) namely, the nomination or\r\nelection of a sheriff by the mayor drinking to an individual at a public\r\nbanquet. It appears that the lord mayor had recently drunk to William\r\nRoberts, citizen and vintner, thereby intimating that it was his\r\nlordship’s wish that Roberts should be one of the sheriffs for the year\r\nensuing. The commons objected to the mayor thus exercising his\r\nprerogative, whilst the aldermen were no less determined to support\r\nhim.(1467) The committee to whom the matter was referred suggested a\r\ncompromise, namely, that Roberts should be bound over to take upon himself\r\nthe office if within the next two or three years he should be either drunk\r\nto by the mayor or elected by the commons to be sheriff; and that,\r\nfurther, an Act of Common Council should be forthwith made for settling\r\nthe shrievalty and all matters connected with it.(1468)\r\n\r\n(M746)\r\n\r\nNo Act of Common Council appears to have been passed pursuant to the\r\ncommittee’s recommendation, but in the following year (1675) and down to\r\n1679 the mayor exercised his full prerogative of electing one of the\r\nsheriffs without opposition, although the person so elected did not always\r\nundertake the office.\r\n\r\n(M747)\r\n\r\nOn Midsummer-day, 1680, the mayor elected George Hockenhall, citizen and\r\ngrocer, to be one of the sheriffs, but Hockenhall refused to serve and was\r\ndischarged on his entering into a bond for the payment of £400. The\r\ncommons thereupon stept in and elected Slingsby Bethell, leatherseller,\r\nand Henry Cornish, haberdasher.(1469) At this juncture political influence\r\nwas brought to bear upon the elections. Bethell was particularly an object\r\nof aversion to the court party. He is reported to have declared himself\r\nready to have acted as executioner of the late king if no one else could\r\nbe found for the job,(1470) and to have made himself obnoxious in other\r\nways. With Cornish little fault could at present be found. Objection was\r\nraised to both these gentlemen acting as sheriffs, on the ground that they\r\nhad not taken the oath or received the sacrament as prescribed by law, and\r\nanother election demanded. Before this second election took place (14\r\nJuly) they had qualified themselves according to the Corporation\r\nAct.(1471) The mayor did not claim his prerogative on this occasion.\r\nBethell and Cornish were put up again for office, and against them two\r\nothers, Ralph Box, grocer, and Humphrey Nicholson, merchant taylor, who,\r\nalthough nominated like Bethell and Cornish by the commonalty, were in\r\nreality candidates put forward by the court party.(1472) Bethell and\r\nCornish having been again declared elected, a poll was demanded, which\r\nlasted several days. At its close it was found that Cornish was at the\r\nhead with 2,483 votes, Bethell next with 2,276, whilst Box and Nicholson\r\nfollowed with 1,428 and 1,230 votes respectively.(1473)\r\n\r\n(M748)\r\n\r\nThe two first named were declared (29 July) duly elected. Bethell has been\r\ndescribed as a \"sullen and wilful man,\" a republican at heart and one that\r\n\"turned from the ordinary way of a sheriff’s living into the extreme of\r\nsordidness.\" Cornish on the other hand was \"a plain, warm, honest man and\r\nlived very nobly all his year.\"(1474) It was doubtless Bethell’s proposal\r\nthat the customary dinner to the aldermen on the day the new sheriffs were\r\nsworn in should be omitted. If so, Cornish had to give way to the\r\nparsimonious whim of his fellow sheriff. \"What an obstinate man he was!\"\r\nremarked Cornish of him, when brought to trial five years later.(1475) The\r\naldermen refused to accompany the sheriffs to the Guildhall unless they\r\nwere invited to dinner.(1476)\r\n\r\n(M749)\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1681) two other sheriffs of the same political\r\ncharacter, viz., Pilkington and Shute, were elected over the heads of the\r\nsame court candidates that had stood the previous year, the defeat of the\r\nlatter being still more pronounced.(1477)\r\n\r\n(M750)\r\n\r\nThe king did not attempt to conceal his displeasure at the City’s\r\nproceedings, and when the recorder and the sheriffs came to invite him to\r\ndinner on lord mayor’s day,(1478) made the following answer:—\"Mr.\r\nRecorder, an invitation from my lord mayor and the city is very acceptable\r\nto me, and to show that it is so, notwithstanding that it is brought by\r\nmessengers that are so unwelcome to me as these two sheriffs are, yet I\r\naccept it.\"(1479)\r\n\r\n(M751)\r\n\r\nThe outgoing sheriffs were presented (27 June) with an address(1480) from\r\nthe citizens assembled in Common Hall thanking them for their faithful\r\ndischarge of their office of trust and complimenting them more especially\r\nupon their successful efforts to maintain and assert the undoubted rights\r\nand privileges of the citizens and their \"continual provision of faithful\r\nand able juries.\" The address concluded with thanks to them for their\r\ndespatch in carrying out the recent \"unnecessary\" poll in connection with\r\nthe election of new sheriffs, and not delaying the matter by troublesome\r\nadjournments.\r\n\r\n(M752)\r\n\r\nOpportunity was also taken of thanking the lord mayor (Sir Patience Ward)\r\nand the members of the Common Council for presenting the recent address to\r\nhis majesty praying him to confide in parliament,(1481) and desired his\r\nlordship to assure his majesty that the address reflected the true feeling\r\nand desires of all his loyal subjects there assembled in Common Hall,\r\nnotwithstanding rumours to the contrary. They also desired to join in the\r\nvote of thanks which the Common Council had passed to the city members\r\nsitting in the last parliament for their faithful services.\r\n\r\n(M753)\r\n\r\nIt required some courage for the mayor to again face the king and his\r\nchancellor and to run the risk of another rebuff. Nevertheless, on\r\nThursday, the 7th July, the mayor went to Hampton Court, attended by Sir\r\nRobert Clayton, Sir John Shorter and others, as well as by the sheriffs\r\nBethell and Cornish (the new sheriffs not coming into office until\r\nSeptember), to present to the king in council another address from the\r\nCommon Hall. It was received with no more favour than the last. The\r\nchancellor affected to believe that it was but the address of a faction in\r\nthe city, and not the unanimous vote of the citizens at large. \"The king\r\ntakes notice there are no aldermen,\" he said, whilst Alderman Clayton and\r\nAlderman Shorter were at his elbow! In fine they were again told to mind\r\ntheir own business.(1482)\r\n\r\n(M754)\r\n\r\nAlthough the court party had twice signally failed to obtain the\r\nappointment of sheriffs who should be amenable to its control, they were\r\nfortunate in having an adherent in the mayor elected on Michaelmas-day to\r\nsucceed Sir Patience Ward. The senior alderman who had not already passed\r\nthe chair happened to be Sir John Moore. It does not often occur that in\r\nthe choice of a mayor the Common Hall passes over the senior alderman who\r\nis both capable and willing to take upon himself the office; but there was\r\nsome chance of it doing so in this case, inasmuch as Sir John Moore had\r\nrendered himself unpopular with a large section of citizens by presenting\r\nan address of thanks to the king for the declaration which his majesty had\r\npublished in defence of his having dissolved parliament.(1483) Two\r\naldermen, Sir John Shorter and Thomas Gold, were nominated with Moore for\r\nthe office. A poll was demanded, with the result that Moore was elected by\r\na majority of nearly 300 votes over his opponents.(1484) On his being\r\npresented (7 Oct.) to the lord chancellor for the king’s approbation, he\r\nwas told that his majesty experienced much satisfaction at the choice of\r\nso loyal and worthy a magistrate.(1485) Three days before (4 Oct.) the\r\nCourt of Aldermen nominated a committee to take informations concerning\r\nthe scandalous remarks that had been made against him in Common Hall on\r\nthe day of his election.(1486)\r\n\r\n(M755)\r\n\r\nNot content with this success, the king’s advisers determined upon\r\nbringing the City to book for its recent attitude in the election of\r\nsheriffs. The anomaly by which the citizens of London enjoyed the right of\r\nelecting their own sheriffs, as they had done with short intermissions for\r\nthe past 500 years, whilst in nearly every county of the kingdom the\r\nsheriffs were nominated by the king, must be abolished. A writ in the\r\nnature of a _Quo Warranto_ was accordingly issued to the sheriffs in\r\nJanuary, 1682, calling upon them to summon the mayor and commonalty and\r\ncitizens of the city to appear in his majesty’s court of King’s Bench to\r\nanswer by what warrant they claimed divers liberties, franchises and\r\nprivileges of which the writ declared they were impeached.(1487)\r\n\r\n(M756)\r\n\r\nNotification of service of the writ was formally made to the Common\r\nCouncil on the 18th January. The council showed no signs of dismay; they\r\nscarcely realized, perhaps, at the outset the true significance of the\r\nwrit or the consequence it was likely to entail. They had no cause to\r\nthink that the mayor, commonalty and citizens had usurped any liberties,\r\nfranchises or privileges without due warrant or had abused any to which\r\nthey had lawful title. One thing was plain. It was their duty to maintain\r\nthe rights of the City. They therefore appointed a committee to consult\r\nwith counsel learned in the law, and prepare a defence such as they might\r\nbe advised to make, and ordered the Chamberlain to disburse such sums of\r\nmoney as might be required for the purpose.(1488)\r\n\r\n(M757)\r\n\r\nMore than a twelvemonth was taken up in preparing the long and technical\r\npleadings(1489) preliminary to trial, and in the meantime another severe\r\nstruggle took place in assertion of the right claimed by the citizens to\r\nelect both their sheriffs. The citizens ranged themselves in separate\r\nfactions, the Whig party under sheriff Pilkington, the Tories under the\r\nmayor. Each leader entertained his supporters at dinner.(1490) There was\r\nto have been a banquet held on the 21st April at Haberdashers’ Hall, at\r\nwhich the Duke of Monmouth, Lord Shaftesbury and others of the Whig party\r\nwere to have been present, but the proposal getting wind, the mayor was\r\nstrictly enjoined by the Privy Council to prevent it as being a seditious\r\nmeeting and tending to create factions among the king’s subjects.(1491)\r\n\r\n(M758)\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York, who had for some time past resided in Scotland, had not\r\nincreased in favour with the citizens of London. It is true that the mayor\r\nand aldermen of the city paid their respects to his highness (10 April,\r\n1682) at St. James’s Palace, on his return from the north, after paying a\r\nsimilar visit to the king, who had recently returned to Whitehall from\r\nNewmarket;(1492) but a proposal to offer an address to the duke praying\r\nhim to reside in London found but little response in the Court of\r\nAldermen, and was allowed to drop.(1493) It was not so long ago that his\r\npicture hanging in the Guildhall was found to have been mutilated, an\r\noffer of £500 for the discovery of the perpetrator of the outrage being\r\nwithout effect.(1494) Just when Pilkington was about to lay down his\r\noffice of sheriff the duke entered an action against him for slander,\r\nclaiming damages to the extent of £50,000. For a time he managed to escape\r\nservice of the writ,(1495) but if he was not served before, his presence\r\nin the Common Hall on Midsummer-day for the election of new sheriffs\r\nafforded ample opportunity to serve him then.\r\n\r\n(M759)\r\n\r\nThis election is one of the most remarkable elections in the City’s\r\nannals. The royalist mayor, Sir John Moore, having previously drunk to\r\nDudley North at a banquet at the Bridge House (18 May), thereby intimating\r\nthat he nominated North as one of the sheriffs for the year ensuing,\r\naccording to custom, had issued his precept to the several companies (19\r\nJune) to meet in Common Hall for the purpose of _confirming_ his\r\nnomination and electing another sheriff to serve with his nominee.(1496)\r\nThis form of precept was objected to, and when the Common Cryer called\r\nupon the livery assembled in Common Hall to appear for the \"confirmation\"\r\nof North, he was met with cries of \"No confirmation! No confirmation!\" and\r\nthe rest of his proclamation was drowned in uproar. \"Thereupon,\" runs the\r\nCity’s Record,(1497) \"Thomas Papillon, esq., mercer, John Du Bois, weaver,\r\nand Ralph Box, grocer, citizens of London (together with the said Dudley\r\nNorth, so as aforesaid elected by the lord mayor), were nominated by the\r\ncommonalty, that two of them by the said commonalty might be chosen into\r\nthe office of sheriffs of the city of London and county of Middlesex.\" The\r\nCommon Sergeant having declared Papillon and Du Bois duly elected, a poll\r\nwas demanded. This was granted and proceeded with until seven o’clock in\r\nthe evening, when the meeting was adjourned by the mayor until the 27th.\r\nThe outgoing sheriffs (Pilkington and Shute), however, disregarded the\r\nmayor’s order for adjournment and continued the poll for some time longer,\r\nbut at last adjourned the meeting to the day fixed by the mayor.\r\n\r\n(M760)\r\n\r\nA fresh question thus arose, namely, whether the right of adjourning a\r\nCommon Hall was vested in the mayor for the time being or in the sheriffs.\r\nSir John Moore reported the conduct of Pilkington and Shute to the king’s\r\ncouncil, with the result that before the 27th day of June arrived they\r\nwere both committed to the Tower. They were afterwards admitted to\r\nbail.(1498)\r\n\r\n(M761) (M762) (M763)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Common Hall had been adjourned by the mayor from the\r\n27th June to the 5th July. On the latter day the sheriffs duly appeared on\r\nthe husting, but the mayor being absent through indisposition, the\r\nRecorder declared his lordship’s order that a further adjournment should\r\ntake place until the 7th July. The sheriffs again interposed and asked the\r\nCommon Hall if it was their wish that an adjournment should take place,\r\nand the answer being in the negative they proceeded to finish the poll,\r\nwith the result that Papillon and Du Bois were again declared elected by a\r\nlarge majority. Orders having been given to the Town Clerk to place their\r\nproceedings on record, the Common Hall broke up.(1499)\r\n\r\n(M764)\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the mayor and aldermen appeared in the Guildhall prepared to\r\nproceed with the poll, ignoring all that had taken place two days before.\r\nThe Hall was very crowded, and soon debate arose as to whom belonged the\r\nright of adjournment. The opinion of counsel was taken by both parties\r\nthen and there,(1500) but with little practical result, and the lord mayor\r\nfurther adjourned the Hall until that day week (14 July).\r\n\r\n(M765)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile several aldermen and citizens waited on his majesty in\r\ncouncil, and gave him an account of the late proceedings, with the result\r\nthat an order was sent to the mayor to hold a new election, the last being\r\ndeclared irregular.(1501)\r\n\r\n(M766)\r\n\r\nThe City’s own account of what took place at the Common Hall on the 14th\r\nis thus recorded. After the order for a new election had been read,\r\n\"relation was ... _de novo_ made that Dudley North, esq., citizen and\r\nmercer of London, was elected by the mayor by his prerogative, according\r\nto the custom, into the office of one of the sheriffs of the city of\r\nLondon and county of Middlesex for the year ensuing, that another might be\r\nassociated to him by the commonalty. And upon this, after declaration made\r\nthat the said Dudley North was confirmed and Thomas Papillon, esq.,\r\ncitizen and mercer of London, was chosen sheriffs, certain of the commons\r\ndemanded that it might be decided by the voices of the commons between the\r\nsaid Dudley North and Thomas Papillon and John Du Bois, weaver, and Ralph\r\nBox, grocer (named also by the commonalty), that the two of those four who\r\nshould have the most voices might be the sheriffs elected for the city of\r\nLondon and county of Middlesex for the year ensuing. Whereupon the\r\nsheriffs and other officers of the city in the accustomed manner went into\r\nthe upper chamber, where declaration of the premisses was made by the\r\ncommon sergeant to the mayor and aldermen there sitting; which said mayor\r\nand aldermen, the relation aforesaid well weighing, did declare the said\r\nDudley North to be rightly and duly elected and confirmed according to the\r\nlaw and custom of the said city, and immediately came down upon the place\r\nwhere the Court of Hustings is usually held, and there, in their presence\r\nand by their command, the said Dudley North was solemnly called to come\r\nforth and give his consent to take upon him the said office.(1502) And the\r\nsaid lord mayor did then direct that the poll should be taken only for the\r\nsaid Thomas Papillon, John Du Bois and Ralph Box, by certain persons\r\nthereunto particularly appointed by the said lord mayor, that one of those\r\nthree who had the most voices might be associated to the said Dudley\r\nNorth. And afterwards the said mayor and aldermen departed out of the\r\nhall. And the poll for the said three persons last named was immediately\r\nbegun, and continued until the evening of that day. And then the said\r\ncongregation was, by order of the lord mayor, adjourned until the next\r\nday, being Saturday, the 15th of July aforesaid, at 9 o’clock in the\r\nafternoon [_sic._]. At which day the said poll being continued was in the\r\nafternoon of that day finished. And thereupon relation was made by the\r\ncommon sergeant to the mayor and aldermen that upon the poll taken by the\r\nseverall persons appointed by the said lord mayor as aforesaid, there were\r\n60 voices for Mr. Papillon, 60 voices for Mr. Du Bois, and 1,244 voices\r\nfor Mr. Box. By which it appeared that the said Ralph Box had the most\r\nvoices, and so was elected into the office of one of the sheriffs of the\r\ncity of London and county of Middlesex for the year ensuing. And the same\r\nin the afternoon was so declared by the common sergeant to the commons\r\nthen and there assembled, which said election of the said Ralph Box was by\r\nthe aforesaid mayor, aldermen and commonalty ratified and confirmed. And\r\nthereupon, according to the form and effect of the Act of Common Council\r\nin that case made and provided, publication thereof by proclamation being\r\nthen made in the place where the Hustings Court is usually held in the\r\npresence of the said lord mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, the said Ralph Box\r\nwas then and there solemnly called, etc.\"\r\n\r\nVery different is the account of the proceedings as given us in a tract of\r\nthe day.(1503) From the latter we learn that a separate poll was opened\r\nthe same day by the sheriffs, in which all four candidates were submitted\r\nto the choice of the citizens, and the result of which was declared by\r\nSheriff Pilkington on the 15th, prior to the mayor’s declaration.\r\nAccording to this poll, Papillon and Du Bois were again returned at the\r\nhead with 2,487 and 2,481 votes respectively. There were only 107 in\r\nfavour of confirming North’s election, whilst 2,414 gave their votes\r\nagainst it. Box found himself with only 173 supporters. It was after the\r\ndeclaration of this result that the mayor ordered the common sergeant to\r\ndeclare the result of the other poll, but the declaration of the large\r\nnumber of votes alleged to have been given in favour of Box caused so much\r\nuproar that he could proceed no further. The mayor and aldermen thereupon\r\nleft the hall, and Papillon and Du Bois were declared by the sheriffs duly\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n(M767)\r\n\r\nIt was expected that Box would attend before the next Court of Aldermen to\r\nbe held on the 18th July to give bond for holding office as North had\r\nalready done, but he failed to appear. A petition, therefore, was\r\npresented to the court praying that as Papillon and Du Bois had been\r\nelected sheriffs the court should call them forth according to custom. The\r\nmayor being advised to postpone giving an answer, another petition to the\r\nsame effect was presented at the next court (20 July), whilst yet a third\r\nprayed that a _caveat_ might be entered against North and Box being\r\nadmitted and sworn sheriffs. The mayor was again advised to take time to\r\nconsider his answer.(1504)\r\n\r\n(M768)\r\n\r\nA week later (27 July) the mayor made the following reply to the\r\npetitioners, by advice of the court:—\"Gentlemen, this court hath\r\nconsidered of your petition, and will take care that such persons shall\r\ntake the office of sheriffs upon them as are duly elected according to law\r\nand the ancient customs of this city; and in this and all other things\r\nthis court will endeavour to maintain the rights and privileges of the\r\nchair and of the whole city; and wherein you think that we do otherwise\r\nthe law must judge between us.\"(1505) This was little to the liking of the\r\npetitioners, who complained that it was no answer to their petition; but\r\nthey were summarily dismissed.(1506)\r\n\r\n(M769)\r\n\r\nThus the matter was allowed to rest until the 5th September, when the\r\nCourt of Aldermen were again prayed that Papillon and Du Bois might be\r\ncalled upon to enter into bond according to custom. The only answer\r\nreturned was that Box, who in the opinion of the court had been duly\r\nelected one of the sheriffs, had been discharged from service on payment\r\nof a fine, and that another election would shortly take place. Thereupon\r\nmurmurs arose. There had been too many Common Halls already over this\r\naffair, cried some, and their choice of sheriffs had been made. The mayor\r\nbade them begone in the king’s name, or they would be looked upon as\r\ntumultuous.(1507)\r\n\r\n(M770)\r\n\r\nThe court sat again on the 12th September, when, we are told, a petition\r\nsimilar to those before presented being again brought forward, a debate\r\narose which occasioned some sharp words, and the mayor ordered the sword\r\nto be taken up and so dissolved the court; but nothing of this is recorded\r\nin the minutes of the court.(1508) Two days later (14 Sept.), several\r\npetitions were presented to the court, one being from the free-holders of\r\nMiddlesex.(1509) To these the same reply was made as had been given to the\r\npetitioners of the 27th July. The petitioners were further told that it\r\nwas the mayor’s intention to call a Common Hall on Tuesday, the 19th\r\nSeptember, to elect one to serve in the place of Box.(1510)\r\n\r\n(M771) (M772)\r\n\r\nWhen that day arrived and the common sergeant, acting on instructions from\r\nthe mayor, put forward the name of Peter Rich, there arose repeatedly the\r\ncry of \"No Rich!\" and such a din followed, the citizens declaring loudly\r\nthat they would stand by their old choice, that nothing else could be\r\nheard. At length the sheriffs were given to understand that a poll was\r\ndemanded. The mayor hearing of the proposed poll thereupon came on to the\r\nhustings and declared Rich to be duly elected. The whole business was\r\ncarried on in dumb show, it being impossible to hear anything that was\r\nsaid. Having done this, the mayor dissolved the Common Hall and went home.\r\nThe sheriff proceeded nevertheless to open the poll in the afternoon, with\r\nthe result that 2,082 votes were found in favour of standing by their old\r\nchoice, whilst only thirty-five were for Rich. Hearing that the mayor was\r\nreturning, the sheriffs made a hurried declaration of the result of the\r\npoll, proclaiming Papillon and Du Bois to have been again elected, and\r\ndismissed the assembly. The mayor on his arrival caused the gates of the\r\nGuildhall to be closed. Such is the account of what took place on the 19th\r\nSeptember, as given by the diarist of the day.(1511) The City’s Journal\r\nmerely records in the briefest manner possible the election of Rich.(1512)\r\n\r\n(M773)\r\n\r\nThe next day (20 Sept.) the lord mayor and a deputation of aldermen waited\r\non the king at Whitehall, and informed him of what had taken place. A\r\ncouncil was thereupon summoned for that afternoon, which the sheriffs were\r\nordered to attend. Upon their appearance they were told that they had\r\nbehaved in a riotous manner, and must answer for their conduct before the\r\nKing’s Bench.  They were accordingly made to enter into their own\r\nrecognisances severally for £1,000, besides finding other security.(1513)\r\n\r\n(M774)\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, when Rich was called before the Court of Aldermen to enter\r\ninto bond to take office, a paper was handed to the court desiring that\r\nPapillon and Du Bois might be called to the shrievalty, but it was to no\r\npurpose. The same answer was returned as on previous occasions.(1514)\r\n\r\n(M775)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (28 Sept.) Rich and North were sworn into office amid a\r\ngreat concourse of citizens at the Guildhall, the entrance to which was\r\nstrongly guarded by a company of trained bands in case of disturbance.\r\nWhen the oath was about to be administered to them a protest was made by\r\nPapillon and Du Bois, who attempted to get possession of the book; but\r\nupon the lord mayor commanding them in the king’s name to depart and keep\r\nthe peace, they left the hall and with them went several of the aldermen\r\nwho were their supporters. The new sheriffs entertained the mayor and\r\naldermen, according to custom, at Grocers’ Hall, Rich being a member of\r\nthat company.(1515) Rich subsequently applied for and was allowed the sum\r\nof £100 out of the fine of £400 paid into the Chamber by Box.(1516) The\r\nelection which had been so long and so hotly contested thus ended in a\r\ncomplete victory for the court party.\r\n\r\n(M776)\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days, as it is now, for members of the livery\r\ncompany or companies to which a newly-elected sheriff belonged to\r\naccompany him to the Guildhall on the occasion of his entering upon his\r\noffice. Dudley North, being a member of the Mercers’ Company, had desired\r\nthe officers of the company and several of the livery to pay him this\r\ncompliment, but after considering the matter the court of the company\r\npassed a resolution to the effect that neither officers nor members should\r\nattend him on pain of being expelled from the company, but that they\r\nshould accompany Papillon to the hall and present him to be sworn as one\r\nof the sheriffs.(1517)\r\n\r\n(M777)\r\n\r\nCornish attended the ceremony at the Guildhall, and afterwards (2 Oct.)\r\nswore an information before Sir William Turner,(1518) a brother alderman,\r\nof the treatment he had received at the hands of the soldiers present. The\r\ninformation was to the effect that when he and several other aldermen\r\nentered the hall about nine o’clock in the morning they found a guard of\r\nsoldiers placed at the hall door, and another drawn up before the\r\nhustings, \"who were presently commanded by their officer to stand to their\r\narmes.\" After a short stay in the Council Chamber they returned into the\r\nhall to meet the lord mayor, and for a quarter of an hour walked up and\r\ndown the hall \"betweene the clock-house and the doore wch leads up to the\r\nHustings Court on the north side of the hall.\" Hitherto they had met with\r\nno opposition from the soldiers, but now they were accosted by\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Quiney, the officer in command, who desired \"they would\r\ngive him noe disturbance.\" To this they replied that \"they would give him\r\nnone and expected alsoe not to bee themselves disturbed by anie in that\r\nplace.\" Quiney thereupon left, but soon after returned and told them he\r\nhad orders from the lieutenancy to clear the hall. He was asked to produce\r\nthe order, and if it were found to include aldermen of the city Cornish\r\nand his friends would obey. The order was not forthcoming; it was with the\r\nmajor, said Quiney, who soon afterwards formed up his men and, again\r\naddressing Cornish and the other aldermen, peremptorily required them to\r\nwithdraw or he would expel them by force. Cornish again demanded to see\r\nthe order, but the officer forthwith laid hands on him and thrust him out,\r\ndeclaring that he would abide by the order of the lieutenancy, who were\r\nhis masters. So ends Cornish’s information. Proceedings were subsequently\r\ntaken against Quiney for keeping persons that were liverymen out of the\r\nGuildhall and offering abuse to others.(1519)\r\n\r\n(M778)\r\n\r\nThe next day being Michaelmas-day a Common Hall met to elect a mayor for\r\nthe ensuing year in the place of Sir John Moore.(1520) Four aldermen were\r\nnominated as candidates, viz., Sir William Pritchard, the senior alderman\r\nbelow the chair, Sir Henry Tulse, Sir Thomas Gold and Henry Cornish. The\r\ncommon sergeant having declared that the choice of the citizens lay\r\nbetween Pritchard and Gold, a poll was demanded and allowed, the result of\r\nwhich was declared (4 Oct.) to be as follows:—Gold 2,289, Cornish 2,259,\r\nPritchard 2,233 and Tulse 236.(1521)\r\n\r\nThis result seems to have satisfied no one, and a scrutiny was asked for\r\nin order that the poll books might be compared with the lists of liverymen\r\nof the several companies. It was discovered that certain members of the\r\nlivery of the Merchant Taylors’ and other companies had recorded their\r\nvotes although they had not taken the liveryman’s oath prescribed by such\r\ncompanies. The question of the legality of such votes being submitted to\r\nthe Court of Aldermen, that body decided (24 Oct.) against the\r\nvoters.(1522) The election was watched with anxious interest. Pritchard,\r\nhimself a Merchant Taylor, was known to be of the same political mind as\r\nthe out-going mayor, and it was the common belief at the time that if the\r\nmajority of votes should prove to be in favour of Gold or Cornish, who\r\nwere of the Whig party, the king would interpose and continue Sir John\r\nMoore in office for another year.(1523) His majesty had recently been\r\namusing himself at Newmarket, but he had been kept posted up in city news,\r\nand immediately after his return to Whitehall was waited on by the mayor\r\nand aldermen (22 Oct.) and informed of the state of affairs. The result of\r\nthe scrutiny, according to the paper submitted to the Court of Aldermen,\r\nwas still in favour of Gold and Cornish, but according to the return made\r\nby the mayor(1524) (25 Oct.) Pritchard was placed at the head of the poll\r\nwith 2,138 votes, as against 2,124 for Gold, 2,093 for Cornish and 236 for\r\nTulse. The first two named were therefore presented to the Court of\r\nAldermen for them to choose one to be mayor according to custom, and their\r\nchoice falling upon Pritchard he was declared elected, and on the\r\nfollowing feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) was admitted and sworn.\r\n\r\n(M779)\r\n\r\nA motion was afterwards made (24 Nov.) for a _mandamus_ directing the\r\nmayor and aldermen to swear Gold or Cornish as duly elected mayor of\r\nLondon, but nothing came of it.(1525)\r\n\r\n(M780)\r\n\r\nThe time was thought opportune by the Duke of York for prosecuting his\r\naction for slander against Pilkington commenced in June last. The words\r\ncomplained of, and for which the duke claimed damages to the extent of\r\n£50,000, were declared on the oath of two aldermen—Sir Henry Tulse and Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker—to have been spoken by him at a Court of Aldermen at a time\r\nwhen that body was about to visit the duke to congratulate him upon his\r\nreturn from Scotland, and were to the effect that the duke had burnt the\r\ncity and was then coming to cut their throats. That the words, if spoken—a\r\nquestion open to much doubt—were scandalous to a degree cannot be denied,\r\nbut the claim for damages was none the less vindictive. Instead of laying\r\nhis action in London the duke caused his action to be tried by a jury of\r\nthe county of Hertford (24 Nov.). Pilkington made very little defence (he\r\nprobably thought it useless), and the jury awarded the duke the full\r\namount of damages claimed. The ex-sheriff was of course ruined; he\r\nsurrendered himself into custody(1526) and gave up his aldermanry, in\r\nwhich he was succeeded by Dudley North, the sheriff.(1527)\r\n\r\n(M781)\r\n\r\nStill he was not allowed to rest. In the following February (16 Feb.,\r\n1683) he and his late colleague in the shrievalty, Samuel Shute, together\r\nwith Lord Grey of Wark, Alderman Cornish, Sir Thomas Player, the city\r\nchamberlain (who had recently been called to account for moneys received),\r\nSlingsby Bethell, and others were brought to trial for the disturbance\r\nthat had taken place last Midsummer-day. The trial was opened at the\r\nGuildhall on the 16th February, but the jury being challenged on the\r\nground that the array contained no peer (a peer of the realm being about\r\nto be tried), the challenge was allowed, and the trial put off until the\r\nnext term. On the 8th May, after a long trial, all the accused were found\r\nguilty, and were eventually (26 June) fined in various sums, amounting in\r\nall to £4,100.(1528)\r\n\r\n(M782)\r\n\r\nPilkington’s fall also dragged down Sir Patience Ward, who was proceeded\r\nagainst for perjury, he having stated on oath at the trial of the late\r\nsheriff that the debate in the Court of Aldermen concerning the Duke of\r\nYork was over before Pilkington had arrived, and that there was no mention\r\nmade of cutting throats while he was there. After much contradictory\r\nevidence the jury found the defendant guilty, and he, like Shaftesbury\r\nbefore him, sought refuge in Holland.(1529)\r\n\r\n(M783)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, having experienced so much difficulty in bending the City\r\nto his will, and having so far succeeded in his object as to have a\r\nroyalist mayor in the chair, as well as royalist sheriffs, Charles took\r\nsteps to obtain an equally subservient Common Council. To this end he had\r\nissued a command (18 Dec.) to the mayor to enforce on the electors at the\r\ncoming feast of St. Thomas (21 Dec.) the obligation of electing only such\r\nmen to be members of the new council as had conformed with the provisions\r\nof the Corporation Act. The king’s letter was by the mayor’s precept read\r\nat each wardmote on the day of election.(1530) It was hoped that by this\r\nmeans a Common Council might be returned which might be induced to make a\r\nvoluntary surrender of the City’s charter instead of forcing matters to an\r\nissue at law.(1531)\r\n\r\n(M784)\r\n\r\nThe design failed and the king resolved at length to proceed with the _Quo\r\nWarranto_. After the lapse of more than a twelvemonth the trial came on\r\nfor hearing (7 Feb., 1683). The solicitor-general, who opened the case,\r\npropounded to the court four questions: (1) Whether any corporation could\r\nbe forfeited? (2) Whether the city of London differed from other\r\ncorporations as to point of forfeiture? (3) Whether any act of the mayor,\r\naldermen and Common Council in Common Council assembled be so much the act\r\nof the Corporation as could make a forfeiture? and (4) Whether the acts by\r\nthem done in making a certain by-law and receiving money by it,(1532) or\r\nin making the petition of the 13th January, 1681, and causing it to be\r\npublished, be such acts as, if done by the Corporation, would make a\r\nforfeiture of the Corporation? After a lengthy argument counsel for the\r\nCrown concluded by asking judgment for the king, and that the defendants\r\nmight be ousted of their franchise as a Corporation.\r\n\r\n(M785)\r\n\r\nThe City’s Recorder, Sir George Treby, rose in reply. His argument in\r\nfavour of the City(1533) tended to show that the corporation of London\r\n_quâ_ corporation could not forfeit its existence either by voluntary\r\nsurrender or by abuse of its powers, much less could its existence be\r\nimperilled by the action of those representatives of the city to whom its\r\ngovernment had been confided. The corporation of the City was a governing\r\nbody elected for specific purposes; if it proceeded _ultra vires_ to\r\nestablish market tolls or to offer a petition to the king which was\r\nseditious, an indictment lay against every particular member of that body,\r\nbut no execution could be taken against the mayor, commonalty and citizens\r\nof London, a body politic that is invisible, one that can neither see nor\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nCounsel on the other side had laid stress on the fact that the liberties\r\nand franchises of the City had been often seized or \"taken into the king’s\r\nhands,\" adducing instances with which the reader of the earlier pages of\r\nthis work will be already familiar; and if they could be so seized, they\r\ncould also be forfeited. The Recorder argued that this conclusion was a\r\nwrong one. The effect of the seizure of the City’s liberties in former\r\ndays had only been to place the government of the city in the hands of a\r\n_custos_ or warden. The Corporation continued as before; it might sue and\r\nbe sued as before; it was neither suspended nor destroyed. How could the\r\nking seize a Corporation? Could he himself constitute the mayor,\r\ncommonalty and citizens of a city, or make anyone else such? No, a\r\nCorporation was not, to use a legal phrase, \"manurable\"; it could not be\r\nseized; nor had anyone (he believed) ever imagined such a thing as a\r\ndissolution of a corporation by a judgment in law until that day. At the\r\nconclusion of his speech the further hearing of the case was adjourned\r\nuntil April.\r\n\r\n(M786)\r\n\r\nOn the resumption of the hearing (27 April)(1534) Sir Robert Sawyer, the\r\nattorney-general, at whose suggestion and by whose authority the writ\r\nagainst the City had been issued, took up the argument, commencing his\r\nspeech with an attempt to allay the apprehension excited by the prospect\r\nof forfeiture of the City’s charter. \"It was not the king’s intention,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to demolish at once all their liberties and to lay waste and open\r\nthe city of London, and to reduce it to the condition of a country\r\nvillage,\" as some had maliciously reported, but to amend the government of\r\nthe City \"by running off those excesses and exorbitances of power which\r\nsome men (contrary to their duty and the known laws of the land) have\r\nassumed to themselves under colour of their corporate capacity, to the\r\nreviling of their prince, the oppression of their fellow subjects and to\r\nthe infinite disquiet of their fellow citizens.\"(1535) History had shown\r\nthat the City had never been better governed than when it was in the\r\nking’s hands. Its ancient customs had not been destroyed, but only\r\nrestrained in subordination to the general government of the kingdom, and\r\ntherefore the danger now threatened would not prove so fatal to the City\r\nas had been suggested.\r\n\r\n(M787)\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the arguments on both sides, nearly three months\r\nwere allowed to pass before judgment was given, in the hope that the\r\ncitizens of London might follow the example set by Norwich, Evesham and\r\nother boroughs, and freely surrender their charter. \"I do believe nobody\r\nhere wishes this case should come to judgment,\" was the remark made by\r\nChief Justice Saunders at the conclusion of the hearing; but at length the\r\npatience of the Crown or of the judges was exhausted, and judgment was\r\npronounced (12 June) by Justice Jones in the absence of the Lord Chief\r\nJustice, who was now on the point of death. Briefly, the judgment\r\npronounced was to the effect (1) that a corporation aggregate might be\r\nseized; (2) that exacting and taking money by a \"pretended\" by-law was\r\nextortion and a forfeiture of franchise; (3) that the petition was\r\nscandalous and libellous, and the making and publishing it a forfeiture;\r\n(4) that an Act of Common Council is an Act of the Corporation; (5) that\r\nthe matter set forth in the record did not excuse or avoid those\r\nforfeitures set forth in the replication, and (6) that the information was\r\nwell founded. The result of these findings was that the franchise of the\r\nCorporation was ordered to be seized into the king’s hands, but this\r\njudgment was not to be entered until the king’s pleasure should be known.\r\nAs to the right claimed by the citizens to have and constitute sheriffs (a\r\nright which they had recently shown no disposition to forego) and the\r\nclaim of the mayor and aldermen to be Justices of the Peace and to hold\r\nSessions, the attorney-general was content to enter a _nolle prosequi_.\r\n\r\n(M788)\r\n\r\nA few days before delivery of judgment the Common Council agreed to\r\nexpunge from the records of the court all minutes of proceedings during\r\nthe late civil war that in any way reflected upon the late king.(1536) The\r\nlist of the various minutes thus ordered to be annulled was a very long\r\none, occupying more than ten pages of the city’s Journal, and embraced a\r\nperiod of eighteen years (1641-1659). The municipal authorities may have\r\nthought that by this egregious act of self-stultification they might\r\nmitigate the judgment that was impending over them. If so they were sadly\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n(M789)\r\n\r\nFinding that further resistance was useless the Common Council\r\nunanimously(1537) agreed (14 June) to present a humble petition to his\r\nmajesty asking pardon for their late offences, and declaring their\r\nreadiness to submit to anything that he might command or direct.\r\nAccordingly, on Monday the 18th June, the lord mayor proceeded to Windsor,\r\naccompanied by a deputation of aldermen and members of the Common Council,\r\nto lay this petition before the king in council, and his majesty’s reply,\r\ngiven by the mouth of the lord keeper, was reported to the Common Council\r\non the following Wednesday.(1538)\r\n\r\n(M790)\r\n\r\nThe king, he said, had been very loth to take action against the City, but\r\nhad been driven to do so by the recent elections. Their petition would\r\nhave been more gracious if presented earlier; nevertheless, his majesty\r\nwould not reject it on that account. He would, however, show the City as\r\nmuch favour as could be reasonably expected. It was not his intention to\r\nprejudice them either in their properties or customs, and he had\r\ninstructed Mr. Attorney not to enter judgment lest such a proceeding might\r\nentail serious consequences. The alterations he required were few and\r\neasy. They were these, viz., that no mayor, sheriff, recorder, common\r\nsergeant, town clerk or coroner of the city of London or any steward of\r\nthe borough of Southwark should be appointed without his majesty’s\r\napproval under his sign manual; that if his majesty should express\r\ndisapproval of the choice of a mayor made by the citizens a new election\r\nshould take place within a week, and if his majesty should disapprove of\r\nthe second choice he shall, if he so please, himself nominate a mayor for\r\nthe year ensuing; that if his majesty should in like manner disapprove of\r\nthe persons chosen to be sheriffs, or either of them, he shall, if he\r\nplease, proceed to appoint sheriffs by his commission, but subject to this\r\nrestriction the election of these officers might take according to the\r\nancient usuage of the city; that the lord mayor and Court of Aldermen\r\nmight with leave of his majesty displace any alderman, recorder, common\r\nsergeant, town clerk, coroner of the city or steward of Southwark; that\r\nwhere an election of an alderman had been set aside by the Court of\r\nAldermen another election should be held, and that the Justices of the\r\nPeace should be by his majesty’s commission. These terms accepted by the\r\ncitizens, his majesty would consent to confirm their charter in a manner\r\nconsistent with them. But if they were not speedily complied with his\r\nmajesty had given orders to enter up judgment by the Saturday following,\r\nand any consequences that might follow would be at the door of the\r\ncitizens themselves.\r\n\r\n(M791)\r\n\r\nA \"long and serious\" debate, we are told, followed the reading of this\r\nanswer in the Common Council, after which a poll was taken on the\r\nquestion: whether the court should submit to the king’s terms or not, with\r\nthe result that 104 votes were recorded in favour of accepting them as\r\nagainst 85 votes to the contrary. Whereupon it was \"unanimously\" ordered\r\nthat his majesty should be informed of the court’s submission, and that\r\nthe Midsummer-day elections should be put off until the 18th July.(1539)\r\n\r\n(M792)\r\n\r\nWhilst these proceedings against the city were going on, a writ had been\r\nobtained by Papillon and Du Bois for the arrest of Pritchard, the mayor,\r\nDudley North, the sheriff, and several aldermen, for having made a false\r\nreturn to a _mandamus_ directed to them in November last.(1540) The writ\r\nwas directed to Broom, the city’s coroner, who executed it by lodging the\r\nparties in his own house (24 April). No sooner was this done than one of\r\nthe city sergeants proceeded to arrest the coroner, who was taken to the\r\ncompter, where he had to pass the night, whilst the mayor and his\r\nfellow-prisoners made their way home. A cry that the Whigs had seized the\r\nmayor and carried him off caused great consternation, and the trained\r\nbands were immediately ordered out for the security of the city. The\r\ncitizens themselves were much divided in their opinions on the matter,\r\n\"some condemning it and others approving it, according to the different\r\ntempers of persons.\"(1541)\r\n\r\n(M793)\r\n\r\nA committee was appointed (26 April) by the Court of Aldermen to consider\r\nwhat was fit to be done by way of vindicating the honour of the mayor and\r\nthe government of the city, as well as for punishing the authors of the\r\nindignity;(1542) whilst the Common Council caused it to be placed on\r\nrecord (22 May) that neither they nor the citizens at large had any\r\nparticipation in or knowledge of the action against the mayor, which\r\nPapillon and Du Bois alleged had been brought in the name of the citizens\r\nof London.(1543) Broom’s conduct, as well as the terms on which he held\r\nhis appointment, were made the subject of an investigation by a\r\ncommittee.(1544)\r\n\r\n(M794)\r\n\r\nAfter Pritchard’s year of office expired he brought an action on the case\r\nagainst Papillon for false imprisonment, and eventually (6 Nov., 1684)\r\nobtained a verdict and damages to the respectable amount of £10,000. This\r\nverdict, whilst it caused amazement to many, met with the avowed approval\r\nof Jeffreys, recently promoted to be Lord Chief Justice, who complimented\r\nthe jury upon their good sense. \"Gentlemen,\" he remarked at the close of\r\nthe trial, \"you seem to be persons that have some sense upon you, and\r\nconsideration for the government, and I think have given a good verdict\r\nand are to be greatly commended for it.\"(1545) Papillon thereupon\r\nabsconded.\r\n\r\n(M795)\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of delivery of judgment against the City, discovery was\r\nmade of a plot against the lives of the king and the Duke of York.(1546)\r\nThis was the famous Rye House Plot, which brought the heads of Lord\r\nRussell and Algernon Sydney to the block. Among the minor conspirators\r\nwere two men who had been employed by Broom, the city coroner, in the\r\nrecent arrest of the lord mayor. Broom himself was suspected of being\r\nimplicated in the conspiracy, and was on that ground ordered into custody\r\nfor the purpose of being examined by a justice of the peace. In the\r\nmeantime he was to be suspended from his office of coroner, as well as\r\nfrom his duties as a member of the Common Council.(1547)  Concurrently\r\nwith the Rye House Plot there was, so it was said, a design to raise an\r\ninsurrection in the city, in which Alderman Cornish was believed to be\r\nimplicated.(1548) The municipal authorities, however, as a body, were\r\nindignant at the threatened attack on the king and his brother, and lost\r\nno time in voting an address (2 July) of congratulation upon their escape,\r\nassuring the king at the same time of their readiness to hazard their\r\nlives and fortunes in defence of his person and the maintenance of the\r\ngovernment in Church and State.(1549)\r\n\r\n(M796)\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 27th September, the mayor laid before the Common Council\r\ndrafts of a surrender of the City’s franchise to his majesty, and of a\r\nre-grant from his majesty which the Attorney-general had prepared for\r\ntheir acceptance. After long debate the opinion of the Attorney-general,\r\nthe Solicitor-general, and the Recorder was taken upon the following\r\nquestions, viz., (1) Whether the surrender was agreeable to the submission\r\nof the Common Council already made and necessary for the regulations\r\nrequired by his majesty; (2) whether by this surrender the office of\r\nmayoralty was surrendered; (3) if so, whether the customs and\r\nprescriptions belonging to that office were not thereby surrendered and\r\nlost; (4) whether in case judgment should be entered up (as the king had\r\nthreatened) the consequences would not be worse than a surrender; and (5)\r\nhow far did the re-grant confirm and restore the city to the liberties,\r\netc., therein mentioned. On the following Tuesday (2 Oct.) the opinions of\r\nthe several counsel were ready.(1550) Two of them, viz., that of the\r\nAttorney-general and that of the Solicitor-general were decidedly in\r\nfavour of the City surrendering its liberties in preference to allowing\r\njudgment to be entered up. The Recorder took a diametrically opposite view\r\nof the matter, one of the reasons urged by him against a surrender being\r\nthat such action would be against their oaths, and that if they freely\r\nsurrendered their liberties there would be no redress left open to them.\r\nIf, on the other hand, they suffered judgment to be entered up, they could\r\ntake proceedings against it by writ of error. These opinions gave rise to\r\nmuch debate, and many hard things were spoken against the Recorder. At\r\nlast the matter was put to the vote, when 103 were found against sealing\r\nthe deed of surrender as against 85 who were in favour of it; and so this\r\nmomentous question was settled, and the council broke up at eleven o’clock\r\nat night.(1551)\r\n\r\n(M797)\r\n\r\nJudgment was forthwith (4 Oct.) entered against the City. The mayor and\r\nthe new sheriffs were summoned to attend the king. Pritchard received a\r\ncommission to continue in office during pleasure, and similar commissions\r\nwere handed to the new sheriffs. The Recorder was dismissed and his place\r\ngiven to Sir Thomas Jenner.(1552) Eight aldermen were turned out and their\r\nplaces filled by nominees of the king.(1553) On the 25th October the Court\r\nof Aldermen was informed of his majesty’s commission having been issued\r\nfor Sir Henry Tulse to be mayor for the ensuing year, and on the 29th he\r\nwas sworn with the usual accompaniment of civic procession and\r\nbanquet.(1554)\r\n\r\n(M798)\r\n\r\nHaving thus reduced the Corporation of the city to submission, Charles\r\nproceeded to take similar action against the livery companies, with the\r\nobject of getting into his own hands the power of appointing and\r\ndismissing their governing body. Seeing that opposition was useless, they\r\nsubmitted with the best grace they could, surrendering their former\r\ncharters and receiving new charters in their place. The first master,\r\nwardens and assistants were usually named in these new charters, which\r\nprovided (_inter alia_) that they should be removable at the king’s\r\npleasure by Order in Council, that they should take the oaths of\r\nallegiance and supremacy and make the declaration prescribed by the\r\nCorporation Act, that none should be elected members who were not of the\r\nChurch of England, and that in all things concerning the government of the\r\ncity they should be subject to the mayor and aldermen.\r\n\r\n(M799)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the treatment that the citizens had received at the king’s\r\nhands they heard of his sudden illness (2 Feb., 1685) with unfeigned\r\nsorrow, and the Court of Aldermen (5 Feb.) instructed the sheriffs to\r\nattend at Whitehall every morning and Sir William Turner and Sir James\r\nEdwards every evening during his majesty’s illness.(1555) Their\r\nattendance, however, was not long required, for next day (6 Feb.) the king\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M800)\r\n\r\n\"They will never kill me, James, to make you king,\" the late king is said\r\nto have cynically remarked to his brother; and, indeed, the accession of\r\nthe Duke of York was accepted by the nation in general, as well as by the\r\nCity of London in particular, with considerable foreboding. The new king\r\nfor a short while was content to feel his way before plunging into the\r\nheadstrong course of action which eventually lost him the crown. Although\r\nsuspected of being a Catholic at heart, it was only during his last\r\nmoments that Charles had accepted the ministrations of the Roman Church.\r\nThe new king had for years been an avowed Catholic; nevertheless, in his\r\nfirst speech to the Privy Council he announced his intention of\r\nmaintaining the established government, both in Church and State. This\r\nspeech, made within an hour of the late king’s death, was received with\r\nrapturous applause. It was quickly followed by a proclamation of his\r\nmajesty’s wish that all persons in office at the time of the decease of\r\nthe late king should so continue until further notice.(1556) Another\r\ndocument proclaiming the death of the late king and the devolution of the\r\ncrown to the Duke of York was at the same time drawn up by the Lords\r\nSpiritual and Temporal, with the assistance of the privy council, the\r\nmayor, aldermen and citizens of London and others.(1557) This document did\r\nnot bear the signature of the mayor as that proclaiming James I had done.\r\n\r\n(M801)\r\n\r\nJames had not been many days on the throne before the question of supply\r\nhad to be settled. More than one-half of the whole revenue of the crown\r\nwas derived from the customs, and these had been settled on Charles for\r\nlife only, and could not therefore be exacted by his successor without the\r\nassent of parliament. No parliament had been summoned since the\r\ndissolution of the parliament at Oxford four years since (28 March, 1681).\r\nAs time was pressing and some delay must have taken place before a new\r\nparliament could meet, James took the advice of Chief Justice Jeffreys,\r\nand did violence to the constitution by proclaiming (9 Feb.) the\r\ncontinuation of the payment of customs as a matter of necessity, whilst at\r\nthe same time he intimated his intention of speedily calling a\r\nparliament.(1558) The pill thus gilded was swallowed without protest. The\r\nexcise duties was another matter and was dealt with differently. The\r\n\"additional excise,\" like the customs, had been given to the late king for\r\nlife, but there was a clause in the Act which empowered the Lords of the\r\nTreasury to let them to farm for a term of three years without any\r\nlimitation as to their being so long due. A lease was now propounded as\r\nhaving been made during the late king’s life (the document bearing date\r\nthe 5th February, the day preceding his decease), although there was every\r\nreason for supposing it to have been made after his death and to have been\r\npost-dated. The judges were appealed to, and with every desire to curry\r\nfavour with the new king, the majority pronounced the document to be good\r\nin law. Thus fortified, James no longer hesitated to issue a proclamation\r\n(16 Feb.) for the continuation of the excise.(1559)\r\n\r\n(M802)\r\n\r\nA parliament was summoned for the 9th April, but did not meet until the\r\n19th May. In the meantime the king and queen had been crowned at\r\nWestminster on St. George’s day (23 April). The City put in their\r\ncustomary claim,(1560) but this was at first disallowed \"in regard of the\r\njudgment upon the _Quo Warranto_ for seizure of the cities franchise.\"\r\nUpon appeal being made, however, to the king himself the claim was\r\nallowed, and the mayor, aldermen and citizens were treated with high\r\nhonour both in the Abbey and at the banquet in Westminster Hall, the mayor\r\nbeing presented by the king with the cup of pure gold and cover, weighing\r\nin all upwards of twenty ounces, with which he had served his majesty with\r\nwine.(1561) A few days before the banquet took place Sir Robert Vyner sent\r\nto the mayor to borrow the City’s plate for the occasion. The matter was\r\nlaid before the Court of Aldermen and permission was granted the lord\r\nmayor to lend such plate as could be spared.(1562)\r\n\r\n(M803)\r\n\r\nWhen parliament met (19 May) the majority in favour of the court party was\r\nenormous. This was in no small measure due to the reformation that had\r\nbeen forced on other corporate towns besides the city of London. They had\r\nbeen made to surrender their charters, and the late king had in return\r\ngranted them new charters in which Tories alone were named as members of\r\nthe corporations. Only one more step was necessary in order to secure the\r\nreturn of a Tory parliament when the time for fresh elections should\r\narrive, and that step was taken. The parliamentary franchise in boroughs\r\nwas restricted to members of the corporations.(1563) In London the Whigs\r\nwere kept down by fear, and the Tory party reigned supreme. The mayor and\r\nhalf the Court of Aldermen were nominees of the Crown, acting by royal\r\ncommission. No Common Council sat, or if it did it was only for the\r\npurpose of enrolling a proclamation by the king or a precept by the mayor.\r\nAs the election drew near the king, in order to render the result in his\r\nfavour more sure, authorized the Court of Aldermen to grant liveries to\r\nseveral of the city companies, taking care that such only should be\r\nadmitted to the livery as were of \"unquestionable loyalty\" for the purpose\r\nof voting.(1564) By this means four of the most pronounced Tories in the\r\ncity were returned, all of them being aldermen. These were Sir John Moore\r\nand Sir William Pritchard, both of whom had been placed in the mayoralty\r\nchair, one after the other (in 1681 and 1682), by court influence, Sir\r\nPeter Rich, who had served as sheriff with Dudley North in 1682, and Sir\r\nSamuel Dashwood, who filled the same office the following year with Peter\r\nDaniel, both of them, like their immediate predecessors, being nominees of\r\nthe Crown. As soon as the House met the Commons unanimously granted the\r\nking the full revenue which had been enjoyed by his brother.(1565)\r\n\r\n(M804)\r\n\r\nThe bent of the king’s mind was quickly discerned in the sentences\r\npronounced by judges eager to secure his favour. Titus Oates was taken out\r\nof prison and whipt at the cart’s tail from Aldgate to Newgate the day\r\nafter parliament met. Two days later he was again whipt from Newgate to\r\nTyburn, and the punishment was so mercilessly carried out that it nearly\r\ncost him his life. Precautions had to be taken by the mayor to prevent a\r\ndisplay of force by Oates’s partisans, who overturned the pillory on which\r\nhe was to stand.(1566) Dangerfield, another professional informer, was\r\nmade to undergo a punishment scarcely less severe. He survived the\r\npunishment, but only to die from the effect of a vicious blow dealt him by\r\na bystander as he was being carried back to gaol from Tyburn.\r\n\r\n(M805)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Richard Baxter—the most learned and moderate of\r\nNonconformists—was tried at the Guildhall on a charge of having introduced\r\ninto his commentary on the New Testament some seditious remarks respecting\r\nthe attitude of the government towards dissenters. The infamous Jeffreys\r\npresided at the trial, and spared neither counsel nor prisoner his\r\ninsolent invectives. The whole proceedings were nothing less than a farce,\r\nand the evidence adduced was of such a flimsy character that Baxter\r\nvolunteered a remark expressing a doubt whether any jury would convict a\r\nman on it. He was, however, mistaken. The sheriffs, like the mayor, were\r\nbut tools of the court party, and the jurymen selected to sit on the trial\r\ndid not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty. He was fortunate to get\r\noff with no worse sentence than a fine of 500 marks and imprisonment until\r\nit was paid.(1567)\r\n\r\n(M806)\r\n\r\nThere was doubtless a large number of inhabitants of the city who would\r\ngladly have assisted Monmouth—\"the champion of the dissenters and extreme\r\nProtestants\"—had they been in a position to do so. But as soon as the news\r\nof the duke’s landing in Dorsetshire reached London orders were issued by\r\nthe mayor for a strict watch to be kept by night throughout the city, and\r\nfor the arrest of all suspicious characters, whilst the duke and his\r\nsupporters were proclaimed traitors and rebels. It was forbidden to\r\ncirculate the duke’s manifesto in the city, and on the 16th June, or\r\nwithin five days of his landing, a price of £5,000 was put upon his\r\nhead.(1568) After Monmouth’s defeat at Sedgmoor (6 July) he and his\r\ncompanions sought safety in flight. Monmouth himself fled to the New\r\nForest, where he was captured in the last stage of poverty, sleeping in a\r\nditch, and was brought to London. He was lodged in the Tower, where his\r\nwife and three children had already been sent. Thousands of spectators,\r\nwho, we are told, \"seemed much troubled,\" went forth to witness his\r\narrival by water on the evening of the 13th July. Two days later he was\r\nexecuted on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n(M807)\r\n\r\nThe utmost cruelty, both military and judicial, was inflicted on\r\nMonmouth’s supporters. Many were hanged by royalist soldiers—\"Kirke’s\r\nlambs,\" as they were called—without form of law. Others were committed for\r\ntrial until Jeffreys came to hold his \"Bloody Assize,\" when to the cruelty\r\nof the sentences passed on most of them was added the ribald insolence of\r\nthe judge. The opportunity was taken of giving the city of London a\r\nlesson, and Henry Cornish, late alderman and sheriff, was suddenly\r\narrested. This took place on Tuesday the 13th October. He was kept a close\r\nprisoner, not allowed to see friends or counsel, and deprived of writing\r\nmaterials. On Saturday he was informed for the first time that he would be\r\ntried on a charge of high treason, and that the trial would commence on\r\nthe following Monday (19 Oct.). His attitude before the judges was calm\r\nand dignified. Before pleading not guilty to the charge of having\r\nconsented to aid and abet the late Duke of Monmouth and others in their\r\nattempt on the life of the late king (the Rye House Plot), he entered a\r\nprotest against the indecent haste with which he had been called upon to\r\nplead and the short time allowed him to prepare his case. He asked for\r\nfurther time, but this the judges refused.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief witnesses for the Crown was Goodenough, who had a\r\npersonal spite against Cornish for his having objected to him (Goodenough)\r\nserving as under-sheriff in 1680-1, the year when Bethell and Cornish were\r\nsheriffs.(1569) Goodenough had risked his neck in Monmouth’s late\r\nrebellion, but he had succeeded in obtaining a pardon by promises of\r\nvaluable information against others. With the king’s pardon in his pocket\r\nhe unblushingly declared before the judges that he, as well as Cornish and\r\nsome others, had determined upon a general rising in the city at the time\r\nof the Rye House Plot. \"We designed,\" said he, \"to divide it (_i.e._, the\r\ncity) into twenty parts, and out of each part to raise five hundred men,\r\nif it might be done, to make an insurrection.\"(1570) The Tower was to be\r\nseized and the guard expelled.\r\n\r\nCornish had been afforded no opportunity for instructing counsel in his\r\ndefence. He was therefore obliged to act as his own counsel, with the\r\nresult usual in such cases. He rested his main defence upon the\r\nimprobability of his having acted as the prosecution endeavoured to make\r\nout. This he so persistently urged that the judges lost patience.\r\nImprobability was not enough, they declared; let him call his witnesses.\r\nWhen, however, Cornish desired an adjournment in order that he might bring\r\na witness up from Lancashire, his request was refused. His chief witness\r\nhe omitted to call until after the lord chief justice had summed up. This\r\nman was a vintner of the city, named Shephard, at whose house Cornish was\r\ncharged with having met and held consultation with Monmouth and the rest\r\nof the conspirators. The bench after some demur assented to the prisoner’s\r\nearnest prayer that Shephard’s evidence might be taken. He showed that he\r\nhad been in the habit of having commercial transactions with Cornish and\r\nwas at that moment in his debt; that on the occasion in question Cornish\r\nhad come to his house, but whether he came to speak with the Duke of\r\nMonmouth or not the witness could not say for certain; that he only\r\nremained a few minutes, and that no paper or declaration (on which so much\r\nstress had been laid) in connection with the conspiracy was read in\r\nCornish’s presence; that in fact Cornish was not considered at the time as\r\nbeing in the plot. Such evidence, if not conclusive, ought to have gone\r\nfar towards obtaining a verdict of acquittal for the prisoner. This was\r\nnot the case, however; the witness was characterised by one of the judges\r\nas \"very forward,\" and when Cornish humbly remonstrated with the treatment\r\nhis witness was receiving from the bench he was sharply told to hold his\r\ntongue. The jury after a brief consultation brought in a verdict of\r\nguilty, and Cornish had to submit to the indignity of being tied—like a\r\ndangerous criminal—whilst sentence of death was passed upon him and three\r\nothers who had been tried at the same time.\r\n\r\n(M808)\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was allowed but three clear days before he was hanged at the\r\ncorner of King Street and Cheapside, within sight of the Guildhall which\r\nhe had so often frequented as an alderman of the city, and on which his\r\nhead was afterwards placed. He met his end with courage and with many\r\npious expressions, but to the last maintained his innocence with such\r\nvehemence that his enemies gave out that he had \"died in a fit of\r\nfury.\"(1571) The injustice of his sentence was recognised and his\r\nconviction and attainder was afterwards reversed and annulled by\r\nparliament (22 June, 1689).(1572)\r\n\r\n(M809)\r\n\r\nOf the three others who had been tried with Cornish, two were reprieved\r\n(one was afterwards executed), but the third, Elizabeth Gaunt, was burnt\r\nat Tyburn the same day that Cornish suffered (23 Oct.) for having\r\nharboured an outlaw named Burton and assisted him to escape beyond the\r\nlaw. He had been implicated in the Rye House Plot, but with the aid of\r\nMrs. Gaunt, who lived in the city, had contrived to avoid capture. In\r\norder to save his own skin the wretch did not hesitate to turn king’s\r\nevidence and to sacrifice the life of his benefactress, a woman who is\r\ndescribed as having \"spent a great part of her life in acts of charity,\r\nvisiting the gaols and looking after the poor.\" She too died with great\r\nfortitude, arranging with her own hands the straw around her, so as to\r\nburn the more speedily.(1573)\r\n\r\n(M810)\r\n\r\nParliament began to be alarmed at the favour shown to Catholics, and this\r\nalarm was increased by a report from France that Louis XIV, with whom\r\nJames was known to be closely allied, and on whom he depended, like his\r\nlate brother, for pecuniary support, had revoked the Edict of Nantes\r\ngranted by Henry IV in favour of his Protestant subjects. The report was\r\nsoon confirmed by the appearance of numbers of French Protestants—refugees\r\nfrom persecution—in England, and more especially in the city of London.\r\nWhat Louis had done in France James, it was feared, would carry out in\r\nEngland by means of his standing army commanded by Roman Catholic\r\nofficers. Hence the alarm which pervaded not only parliament, but also the\r\ncity and the nation at large.\r\n\r\n(M811)\r\n\r\nHence too it was that when the Houses, which had been adjourned during the\r\ncampaign in the West, met on the 9th November,(1574) they remonstrated\r\nwith him for the favour he had shown to Catholics in direct contravention\r\nof the law. Finding himself unable to bend parliament to his will, he\r\ndetermined to do without one, and accordingly, after a brief session, it\r\nstood prorogued (20 Nov.),(1575) never to meet again during the present\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n(M812)\r\n\r\nWithout a parliament James could act with a free hand. By a piece of\r\nchicanery he managed to get a legal decision acknowledging the dispensing\r\npower of the king.(1576) He established an Ecclesiastical Commission\r\nCourt, with the infamous Jeffreys at its head, the first act of which was\r\nto suspend the Bishop of London for upholding the Protestant faith. He\r\nremoved the Earl of Clarendon (son of the late Chancellor), who had\r\nrecently been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland,(1577) and appointed as\r\nlord deputy the Earl of Tyrconnel, a Roman Catholic of low character, who\r\nhad gained an unenviable notoriety as the \"lying Dick Talbot.\" The country\r\nwas over-run with Papists from abroad. All the laws against the exercise\r\nof the Roman Catholic religion were set at defiance. There was no\r\ndisguise. Mass was publicly celebrated at Whitehall and Roman Catholic\r\nchapels sprang up everywhere, giving rise to no small dissatisfaction and\r\ntumult. The agitation in London was great, but greater in the city, where\r\nmen had been less accustomed to the sight of the Romish ceremonial than\r\nthose who lived in the neighbourhood of the court. Riots in the city were\r\nof frequent occurrence, more especially on Sundays, when the Roman\r\nCatholics were more in evidence than on week days. A Roman Catholic chapel\r\nhad recently been erected by the Elector Palatine in Lime Street. An\r\nineffectual attempt had been made by the mayor and aldermen to stay the\r\nwork. They were summoned to appear before the king and reprimanded. The\r\nwork was accordingly allowed to go on and the chapel was opened. On\r\nSunday, the 18th April (1686), the priests attached to the chapel were\r\nfollowed by a mob into Cheapside, and matters would have gone hard with\r\nthem had not the mayor and aldermen appeared on the scene with a regiment\r\nof trained bands. James again sent for the mayor and told him that if he\r\ncould not keep better order in the city he should himself send some\r\n\"assistance.\"(1578) Nevertheless another riot broke out on the following\r\nSunday. A mob entered a Roman Catholic chapel and carried away a crucifix,\r\ncrying out they would have no \"wooden gods.\" A cross was set up on the\r\nparish pump and mock obeisance made to it. The priests were insulted, but\r\nno violence was offered them. When the mayor appeared to quell the tumult\r\nthe crowd affected to disbelieve that his lordship was in earnest. \"What!\r\nthe lord mayor of our city come to preach up popery! too sure, it cannot\r\nbe!\" When the trained bands were ordered to disperse the crowd they\r\ndeclared that in conscience they could not hinder them in their\r\nwork.(1579)\r\n\r\n(M813)\r\n\r\nThese disturbances were very injurious to the trade of the city, and\r\ncaused a considerable fall in the amount of customs paid for merchandise\r\nentering the port of London. A regiment or two of the standing army which\r\nJames had formed might any day appear in the city. \"I shall not wonder if\r\nthe Scotch regiment of guards now quartering at Greenwich be quartered in\r\nCheapside before this week is out,\" wrote a contemporary on the 27th\r\nApril.(1580) A month later the army was encamped at Hounslow, the king\r\nhimself being also there, ready to send \"assistance\" to the city should\r\noccasion arise.(1581)\r\n\r\n(M814)\r\n\r\nFor a time James had entertained the hope of obtaining favours for the\r\nCatholics with the goodwill of the Church of England, whilst continuing\r\nthe persecution of dissenters. Finding this impossible he determined to\r\nmake friends of the dissenters, and to include them in a general\r\ndeclaration of indulgence. Accordingly on the 4th April, 1687, there\r\nappeared a Declaration of Indulgence suspending all laws against Roman\r\nCatholics and dissenters alike.(1582)\r\n\r\n(M815)\r\n\r\nJames would willingly have obtained parliamentary sanction for his\r\ndeclaration if he could. To this end he again took to tampering with\r\ncorporations throughout the country, in the hope of securing thereby a\r\nparliament favourable to his policy of toleration. Six commissioners were\r\nappointed in November to \"regulate\" all the corporations of England, by\r\nturning out all who were opposed to the abolition of the penal laws and\r\nTest Act and putting in their place those who favoured it.(1583) In London\r\ndispensations were granted to the livery companies relieving their members\r\nfrom taking the oaths and test, whilst similar dispensations were included\r\nin the royal commissions appointing aldermen. In many of the companies\r\nTories of a too pronounced character were turned out and their places\r\ntaken by dissenters.(1584) Everywhere dissenters were treated with the\r\ngreatest consideration. Notwithstanding every effort, however, to capture\r\nthe constituencies at the next elections, James found public opinion\r\nagainst him to be too strong, and all thought of summoning a fresh\r\nparliament had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n(M816)\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile addresses flowed in from various parts of the country\r\nthanking the king for his declaration. Presbyterians, Quakers,\r\nIndependents, Congregationalists alike sent addresses, but as yet no\r\naddress was presented on behalf of the Court of Aldermen—the governing\r\nbody of the city, now that the Common Council was in abeyance. That body\r\nhad to be largely remodelled before it would consent to present any such\r\naddress. On Thursday, the 16th June, the infamous Jeffreys, who had been\r\nrewarded with the seals for his work at the Bloody Assizes, appeared\r\nbefore the Court of Aldermen and declared his majesty’s pleasure that in\r\nfuture that court should nominate and recommend to the Crown such persons\r\nas they thought fit to be aldermen as vacancies occurred, and that no one\r\nso nominated should be exempt from service except for insufficiency of\r\nestate, to be declared on oath. Those who were capable of serving and\r\nrefused to serve when nominated by the court were to be fined, and the\r\nfines were to be devoted to the use and benefit of the city’s orphans. The\r\nancient privilege, too, of the mayor drinking to a future sheriff received\r\nthe king’s sanction.(1585) Having listened to the lord chancellor’s\r\nmessage the court resolved to wait upon the king at Windsor on the\r\nfollowing Sunday to thank his majesty \"for that and all other his\r\nmajesties acts of grace to this court and city.\"(1586) Both the mayor and\r\nthe Court of Aldermen lost no time in exercising their privileges, but\r\nthey experienced great difficulty in getting any one to serve sheriff or\r\nalderman. Fines ran up apace, until no less than £8,500 had been paid by\r\npersons desirous at any cost to be discharged from filling either of those\r\nthankless offices. Many of the aldermen either voluntarily resigned their\r\ngowns or were dismissed from the court because they were unwilling to vote\r\nan address of thanks to James for his declaration.(1587)\r\n\r\n(M817)\r\n\r\nAt length the court was sufficiently packed with dissenters to pass an\r\naddress to the king (26 July) thanking him for his declaration, and\r\nassuring his majesty of their readiness to stand by him with their lives\r\nand fortunes.(1588) The orphans of the city also voted an address,(1589)\r\nas well they might, seeing the amount of money that the declaration had\r\nbeen the means of bringing into the orphans’ fund.\r\n\r\n(M818) (M819) (M820)\r\n\r\nNot every dissenter welcomed the king’s declaration. To many of them it\r\nseemed—what the king intended it to be—only a lever for raising the Roman\r\nCatholics. Baxter, to whom friendly overtures were made by government to\r\nwin him over, refused to join in any address of thanks for the\r\ndeclaration.  John Howe declared himself an opponent of the dispensing\r\npower, and Bunyan declined to enter into any negotiations on the matter at\r\nall.  William Kiffin, on the other hand, an influential Baptist in the\r\ncity, succumbed to the threats, if not to the blandishments, of\r\nJames.(1590) In addition to possessing spiritual gifts of no mean order,\r\nKiffin was also a man of wealth and position in the world of commerce. In\r\nevery way he would prove a valuable ally, if only he could be won over.\r\nAgainst this, however, there was one great impediment: the recollection of\r\nthe judicial murder of his two grandsons, Benjamin and William Hewling, by\r\nJeffreys at the Bloody Assizes. Fondly imagining that the memory of that\r\nfoul act could be blotted out and the stricken heart salved by an increase\r\nof wealth or elevation in rank, James sent for him to court, and after\r\nsome preliminary remarks touching the royal favour that was being shown to\r\ndissenters, told Kiffin that he had put him down as an alderman in his\r\n\"new charter,\" alluding no doubt to the royal commission of 6th August, in\r\nwhich Kiffin’s name appears as alderman of Cheap ward in the place of\r\nSamuel Dashwood. On hearing this Kiffin replied, \"Sir, I am a very old\r\nman,\"—he was seventy years of age when he lost his grandchildren—\"I have\r\nwithdrawn myself from all kind of business for some years past, and am\r\nincapable of doing any service in such an affair to your majesty or the\r\ncity. Besides, sir,\" the old man continued, with tears running down his\r\ncheeks, and looking the king steadily in the face, \"the death of my\r\ngrandsons gave a wound to my heart which is still bleeding, and never will\r\nclose but in the grave.\" For a moment the king was abashed, but quickly\r\nrecovering himself told Kiffin that he (James) would find \"a balsam for\r\nthat sore.\" The old man still held out, until, hearing that legal\r\nproceedings were about to be taken against him, he took counsel’s opinion\r\nas to what was best to be done. He was told that he was running a great\r\nrisk by refusing to become an alderman, for the judges, as they then were,\r\nmight subject him to a penalty of ten, twenty, or thirty thousand pounds,\r\n\"even what they pleased.\" Under such circumstances he consented to be made\r\nan alderman, rather than bring ruin on himself and family. He, however,\r\nput off the evil day as long as he could, and was not sworn into office\r\nuntil the 27th October.(1591)\r\n\r\nKiffin expressed himself as pleased with the reception he met with in his\r\nward, where he was almost a stranger. But much of the business which the\r\nCourt of Aldermen was called upon to execute in those days was distasteful\r\nto him. \"We had frequently orders from the king\" (he writes) \"to send to\r\nthe several companies to put out great numbers of liverymen out of the\r\nprivilege of being liverymen, and others to be put in their rooms; most of\r\nwhich that were so turned out were Protestants of the Church of England.\r\nThere has been a list of seven hundred at a time to be discharged,\r\nalthough no crime laid to their charge.\" The royal commission which\r\nappointed him an alderman also created him a justice of the peace and a\r\nmember of the Court of Lieutenancy, but to use his own words, \"I never\r\nmeddled with either of those places, neither in any act of power in that\r\ncourt [_i.e._, Court of Aldermen] touching causes between man and man, but\r\nonly such things as concerned the welfare of the city and good of the\r\norphans, whose distressed condition called for help, although we were able\r\nto do little towards it.\" He was not called upon to discharge his\r\ninvidious duties for any great length of time; for after being in office\r\nonly nine months he obtained his discharge, to his \"very great\r\nsatisfaction.\" He continued to live for another thirteen years, dying on\r\nthe 29th December, 1701, in his 86th year, and he was buried in Bunhill\r\nFields—that \"God’s acre\" which holds the dust of so many of his fellow\r\nnon-conformists.\r\n\r\n(M821)\r\n\r\nIn September the king had issued a patent for Sir John Shorter to be lord\r\nmayor for the year ensuing. Shorter was a dissenter—\"an Anabaptist, a very\r\nodd ignorant person, a mechanic, I think,\" wrote Evelyn(1592) of him—and\r\non that account a clause was inserted in his commission permitting him to\r\nhave any preacher he might choose.(1593)  His granddaughter was married to\r\nSir Robert Walpole. He was at one time alderman of Cripplegate ward, but\r\nin December, 1682, he fell foul of Charles II for attending a conventicle\r\nat Pinmakers’ Hall, and the Court of Aldermen received orders to remove\r\nhim.(1594) He had recently, however (6 Aug., 1687), been restored to his\r\naldermanry and to his rank of precedence by commission from James,(1595)\r\nand now, by the same usurped authority, he was to become lord mayor. The\r\nfeast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) happening this year to fall on a\r\nFriday, the installation of the new lord mayor, as well as the banquet to\r\nwhich James and the Papal Nuncio had been invited, was postponed until the\r\nfollowing day. The aldermen agreed to defray the cost of the entertainment\r\nout of their own pockets,(1596) each laying down the sum of £50. Kiffin\r\nalso sent £50, although he had not yet been sworn a member of the court;\r\nbut he afterwards regretted having done so when he learnt that the Pope’s\r\nNuncio and other priests had been invited as guests.(1597) The day passed\r\noff well. The Goldsmiths’ Company, of which the new lord mayor was a\r\nmember, made a particularly brave show. The entire roadway from Charing\r\nCross to the city had been fresh gravelled that morning, and the king, who\r\nwas accompanied by the queen, expressed himself as well pleased with the\r\nentertainment afforded him.(1598)\r\n\r\n(M822)\r\n\r\nThe Dissenters now had matters all their own way. The livery companies had\r\nbecome so leavened with an influx of new members, whose claim for\r\nadmittance rested chiefly on their antagonism to the established Church,\r\nthat most of them now sent in addresses to the king thanking him for his\r\nDeclaration of Indulgence. The Barber-Surgeons and the Apothecaries had\r\nalready done so; so had the Clothworkers, the Mercers and the Glovers.\r\nTheir example was now followed by the Cutlers, the Goldsmiths, the\r\nHaberdashers, the Joiners and the Weavers.(1599) The mayor, who kept his\r\nmayoralty at Grocers’ Hall, openly held a conventicle there on Sunday, the\r\n6th November,(1600) whilst he declined to listen to a sermon by the\r\nlearned Dr. Stillingfleet in the Guildhall chapel.(1601) More than this,\r\nhe would have turned the chapel itself into a conventicle could he have\r\nhad his own way.(1602)\r\n\r\n(M823)\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1688 James published a second Declaration of Indulgence\r\nvarying but slightly from the former one, and ordered it to be read in the\r\nchurches of London and Westminster on the 20th and 27th May, and in the\r\ncountry on the 3rd and 10th June. This was more than the clergy could\r\nstand. A meeting of bishops was held at Lambeth for the purpose of drawing\r\nup a petition to the king praying that the clergy might be excused reading\r\nan illegal document in the midst of public service. This petition was\r\nsigned by Sancroft, the primate, and six bishops. Although the Bishop of\r\nLondon was not among those who signed the petition—he at the time being\r\nunder disability—there is reason for believing that Compton had been taken\r\ninto counsel by those who drafted it.(1603) On the petition being\r\npresented James pretended the utmost surprise, and insisted that the\r\npresentation of such a petition was \"a standard of rebellion.\" This took\r\nplace on Friday preceding the first Sunday (20th May) when the Declaration\r\nwas to be read in the London churches. When Sunday arrived people flocked\r\nto the churches to hear what would happen. Only a few of the London clergy\r\nattempted to read the Declaration.(1604) In the country not more than 200\r\nclergy carried out the king’s orders, \"and of these some read it the first\r\nSunday, but changed their minds before the second; others declared in\r\ntheir sermons that though they obeyed the order they did not approve the\r\nDeclaration.\" One minister in particular told his congregation that though\r\nhe was obliged to read it they were not obliged to hear it, and waited\r\nuntil all had left the church before he commenced reading the hateful\r\ndocument. In other places the congregation took the initiative and rose to\r\ngo as soon as the minister commenced reading it.(1605)\r\n\r\n(M824)\r\n\r\nWhat followed is well known. On Friday the 8th June the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury and the six bishops who had signed the petition were summoned\r\nbefore the council and asked if they acknowledged their respective\r\nsignatures. They were next required to enter into bond for appearance\r\nbefore the King’s Bench. This they declined to do, and were thereupon\r\ncommitted to the Tower.(1606) To have carried them through the streets of\r\nthe city might have caused a riot; they were therefore conveyed to the\r\nTower by water, \"and all along as they passed the banks of the river were\r\nfull of people, who kneeled down and asked their blessing, and with loud\r\nshouts expressed their good wishes for them and their concern in their\r\npreservation.\"(1607) The enthusiasm of the Londoners did not end here.\r\nThey continued to flock to the Tower, filling the small chapel where the\r\nbishops attended service to overflowing in order to gaze upon their\r\nbeloved pastors and receive their blessing.(1608) After being kept in\r\nseparate confinement, and allowed to meet only at meals and in chapel, for\r\nten days, the bishops were allowed to come out on bail.\r\n\r\n(M825)\r\n\r\nOn the 29th June they appeared before the King’s Bench on a charge of\r\npublishing a seditious libel. A technical difficulty presented itself at\r\nthe outset, but this was got over, and after a trial of some hours the\r\nquestion of their innocence or guilt was left to a jury drawn, not from\r\nLondon, but from the county of Middlesex. One of the panel stuck out\r\nagainst the rest, and wished to bring in a verdict of guilty, but after\r\nbeing locked up through the night he allowed himself to be persuaded by\r\nhis fellow-jurymen, and on the morning of the 30th June a verdict of not\r\nguilty was found. Thereupon \"there were such shoutings, so long continued,\r\nand as it were echoed into the city, that all people were struck with\r\nit.\"(1609) Bonfires were lighted, guns discharged and church bells rung,\r\nnot only in London but throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n(M826)\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the end was approaching. Already the troops encamped at\r\nHounslow, on which James placed so much dependence, showed signs of\r\ndisaffection. He had hoped that his army would have overawed London,\r\ninstead of which the free spirit of London had, as a result of his policy,\r\nentirely captivated his army. So long as the king was in their midst the\r\ntroops maintained a respectful demeanour, but as soon as his back was\r\nturned they threw off all restraint, and joined in the general exultation\r\nat the late joyful deliverance to the Church of England.(1610)\r\n\r\n(M827)\r\n\r\nThe birth of a prince (10 June), which had recently taken place, served to\r\nhasten the crisis. Those who were willing to have waited patiently for a\r\nrecurrence to the old order of things at the king’s death now saw their\r\nhopes dashed to the ground. The king’s heir and successor, brought up, as\r\nhe undoubtedly would be, in the tenets of his father, promised them little\r\nrelief. Even before the birth of the prince overtures had been made to\r\nWilliam of Orange to appear in England at the head of an army.\r\nNevertheless the Court of Aldermen displayed its loyalty by resolving that\r\nthe conduits in Cheapside and at the Stocks Market should run with claret\r\non Thanksgiving-day. The sheriffs were to take the matter in hand, whilst\r\nthe sum of £50 was raised by the court to defray the cost, the mayor\r\ncontributing £10, each of the sheriffs £5, and the rest of the aldermen\r\nthe balance between them.(1611) Later on (29 June) the mayor, aldermen and\r\nsheriffs waited upon the infant prince and kissed his hand. The various\r\nnurses were presented by the Chamberlain with the respectable _douceur_ of\r\nsixty guineas, whilst ten guineas were given to the lord chancellor’s\r\nmessenger who brought the news to the city of the prince’s birth.(1612)\r\n\r\n(M828)\r\n\r\nThe day that saw the bishops acquitted a letter was despatched, signed by\r\nShrewsbury, Danby, Compton (the suspended Bishop of London) and others, to\r\nthe Prince of Orange, again inviting him to land in England with an armed\r\nforce, and promising to render him every assistance. After some hesitation\r\nWilliam accepted the invitation, and began to make preparations, both\r\nnaval and military, for his descent on England. Towards the close of\r\nSeptember news came from Holland of the vast preparations that were being\r\npushed forward in that country. A fleet of sixty sail was in readiness,\r\nand the prince himself was shortly expected on board. James lost no time\r\nin informing the lord mayor of the state of affairs, and desired that he\r\nand the aldermen would take measures for preserving the city in\r\npeace.(1613) On the 28th he issued a proclamation informing his subjects\r\nof the threatened invasion, and calling upon them to lay aside all\r\njealousies and to unite in defending the country against the foreign\r\nenemy.(1614)\r\n\r\n(M829)\r\n\r\nJames saw, when it was too late, that he had over-taxed the patience of\r\nhis subjects. He was now ready to make any and every concession. As for\r\nthe citizens of London, they should have their charter restored.\r\nAccordingly, on Saturday the 6th October Lord Chancellor Jeffreys appeared\r\nbefore the Court of Aldermen with two separate grants under the great\r\nseal, the one appointing Sir John Chapman to be mayor (in the place of Sir\r\nJohn Eyles(1615)) up to the feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.), with\r\nliberty to the citizens in the meantime to elect one of their own choice\r\nto be mayor for the year ensuing; the other, continuing in office Sir\r\nSamuel Thompson and Sir Humphrey Edwin, then sheriffs, until a new\r\nelection of sheriffs should be made by the citizens. The newly-appointed\r\nmayor and the existing sheriffs thereupon went down into the Guildhall,\r\naccompanied by the lord chancellor, who informed the citizens of the\r\nrestitution of their liberties.(1616) The mayor and sheriffs having taken\r\nthe oaths and subscribed the declaration prescribed by the Corporation\r\nAct, the aldermen returned to their chamber, and such as had been aldermen\r\nat the time of the judgment upon the writ of _Quo Warranto_ and were then\r\npresent were forthwith sworn in for the respective wards from which they\r\nhad been deposed. The court next proceeded to draw up an address to the\r\nking, in which his majesty was assured that with all duty and faithfulness\r\nthey would cheerfully and readily _discharge the trust reposed in them_ to\r\nthe utmost hazard of their lives and fortunes.(1617) One cannot help\r\nnoticing how studiously different the wording of this address is from\r\nthose previously presented. Not a word about defending his majesty’s\r\nperson with their lives and fortunes; these are thenceforth to be expended\r\nin guarding their own liberties! When the Court of Aldermen met three days\r\nlater (9 Oct.) the common sergeant, the town clerk, the comptroller,\r\nswordbearer, common crier and other officers who had been ousted from\r\ntheir places under the _Quo Warranto_ were formally re-instated;(1618) and\r\nthe same day Chapman issued his precept for a Common Hall to meet on the\r\n11th for the election of sheriffs for the year ensuing.(1619) Several\r\naldermen who had lost their places in 1683 declined to be re-instated,\r\namong them being Sir Robert Clayton.(1620) Sir George Treby, who had been\r\nrecorder at the time of the confiscation of the city’s liberties, also\r\nrefused to accept office again; but the Court of Aldermen finding great\r\ndifficulty in getting a suitable person to accept the appointment, Treby\r\nwas finally induced to change his mind, and before the end of the year he\r\noccupied his old place and continued to occupy it until, in 1692, he was\r\nmade chief justice of common pleas.(1621)\r\n\r\nThe city was still without a Common Council, and it was not until the 26th\r\nNovember that the Court of Aldermen advised the mayor to issue his precept\r\nfor an election of common councilmen to take place on the 28th. The\r\ncouncil so elected was to be but a provisional one until the regular\r\nelection should take place on St. Thomas-day (21 Dec.).(1622) On the 1st\r\nDecember the new Common Council sat for the first time,(1623) none having\r\nmet since the 2nd October, 1683.\r\n\r\n(M830)\r\n\r\nThe day that a new Common Council was elected Jeffreys (who was already\r\npacking up to be off) notified that writs were about to be issued for a\r\nnew parliament. The House was to meet on the 15th January (1689). James\r\nhad purposed summoning a parliament for November (1688), and some of the\r\nwrits had been actually sent out, but the Dutch preparations so alarmed\r\nhim that the writs were recalled.(1624)\r\n\r\n(M831)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime an extraordinary council had been held at Whitehall (20\r\nOct.) which the mayor and aldermen of the city had been invited to attend.\r\nThe object of the meeting was to dissipate any doubt that had been\r\nentertained as to the infant prince being actually the king’s son. There\r\nhad been rumours to the contrary, and as the king was about to enter upon\r\na dangerous enterprise in person, he declared his intention of settling\r\nthe question beyond all doubt before leaving. Some twenty witnesses were\r\naccordingly examined then and there as to the prince’s legitimacy, the\r\nking offering to send for the queen herself if the meeting so wished. This\r\noffer, one need scarcely say, was declined.(1625) The same day\r\nproclamation was made for guarding the sea coast and withdrawing all draft\r\ncattle into the interior.(1626)\r\n\r\n(M832)\r\n\r\nThe feast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.) falling on Sunday, Sir John\r\nChapman, who had been re-elected mayor by free choice of the citizens,\r\nproceeded to Westminster by water according to custom on the following\r\nMonday, accompanied by the aldermen, and was sworn before the barons of\r\nthe exchequer. He returned to Grocers’ Hall and there entertained the\r\nlords of the council, the judges and many of the nobility. Notwithstanding\r\nthe precautions taken against riot during the mayor’s absence from the\r\ncity the mob broke out and sacked and burnt a \"mass house\" in\r\nBucklersbury. For this disturbance the mayor and sheriffs were called to\r\naccount by the king.(1627)\r\n\r\n(M833)\r\n\r\nOn the 5th November the Prince of Orange successfully effected a landing\r\nin Torbay. As soon as the news reached London James again sent for the\r\nmayor and aldermen, ordered them to take care of the city, and, if he\r\nshould fall in battle, to proclaim the Prince of Wales successor to the\r\ncrown.(1628) William proceeded to march upon London. At Exeter he was well\r\nreceived, but some little time elapsed before the gentry showed any\r\ndisposition to throw in their lot with the prince. On the 17th James set\r\nout with his army to meet the invader, after receiving an assurance from\r\nthe mayor and aldermen that they would take care of the city during his\r\nabsence.(1629) He reached Salisbury, but soon found himself deserted by\r\nofficers and friends. Among the former was Lord Churchill, afterwards\r\nknown as the Duke of Marlborough, and the greatest soldier of the age.\r\nLeft almost alone, James returned to London, having been absent from the\r\ncapital less than ten days. Like his name-sake the Conqueror, William made\r\nno haste to reach London, but advanced by slow marches, putting up at\r\nvarious gentlemen’s houses on the way. It was agreed that both armies\r\nshould remain at a distance of forty miles from London in order to allow\r\nthe new parliament to meet in safety.\r\n\r\n(M834)\r\n\r\nSince the news of the prince’s landing there had been a renewal of the\r\nattacks made on Roman Catholics and their places of worship in London. On\r\nthe 11th November the mob broke into St. John’s, Clerkenwell, where rumour\r\ndeclared there were stored gridirons, spits and other instruments for\r\ntorturing Protestants. The troops were called out and one or two of the\r\nrioters killed. It was deemed advisable to close all the Roman Catholic\r\nchapels except the royal chapels and those belonging to foreign\r\nambassadors.(1630) Another sign of the times was the fact that the sceptre\r\nbelonging to the statue of Queen Mary set up in the Royal Exchange had\r\neither accidentally fallen or (as was more probable) had been forcibly\r\nstruck out of her hand.(1631) On the 7th December the mayor issued a\r\nprecept to the aldermen of each ward for a careful search to be made in\r\nthe city for all Papists and suspicious persons. He did this because he\r\nunderstood that the inhabitants of the city were much alarmed at the great\r\nresort of Papists to the city who were believed to be meditating some\r\nattack upon London.(1632)\r\n\r\n(M835)\r\n\r\nThe negotiations which had been opened with William were only intended by\r\nJames to serve the purpose of giving the latter time to place his wife and\r\nchild in a place of security before he himself should seek safety in\r\nflight. On the 11th December he attempted to make good his escape. As soon\r\nas it was known that the king had left London a great number of lords,\r\nboth spiritual and temporal, came to the Guildhall, as to a place of\r\nsecurity, the better to consult and take measures for the common weal.\r\nHaving informed the Court of Aldermen of the king’s flight the lords\r\nretired into the \"gallery adjoining to ye councell chamber,\" and there\r\ndrew up a Declaration,(1633) containing in effect their resolution to\r\nassist the Prince of Orange in maintaining the religion, the rights and\r\nthe liberties which had been invaded by Jesuitical counsels. This was\r\ncommunicated to the Court of Aldermen, who thanked the lords for the\r\nfavour shown to the Court. As the occasion was an important one it was\r\ndeemed advisable to summon forthwith a Common Council, as well as the law\r\nofficers of the City, to advise the aldermen as to what was best to be\r\ndone.(1634) A Common Council was accordingly held that same day. Being\r\ninformed of the state of affairs, the court quickly resolved to follow the\r\nexample set by the lords, and themselves to present an address to the\r\nprince.(1635) An address was accordingly prepared, in which, having warmly\r\nacknowledged the prince’s zeal for the Protestant religion and expressed\r\nregret at the king’s measures and his recent flight, the citizens implored\r\nthe prince’s protection, promising him at the same time a hearty welcome\r\nwhenever he should repair to their city. The lieutenancy of the city\r\nfollowed suit the same day with another address, in which his highness was\r\nassured that measures had been taken for preserving the city in peace\r\nuntil his arrival.(1636) The lords, having finished their business in the\r\ncity, dined the same evening with the lord mayor at Grocers’ Hall.(1637)\r\n\r\n(M836)\r\n\r\nOn the 17th a letter from the prince was read before the Common Council.\r\nThe terms of the letter are not recorded in the City’s archives, but it\r\nprobably contained some reference to the peace of the city, for the\r\ncouncil, after preparing an answer to it, forthwith gave orders for the\r\nguards of the trained bands to be increased by three regiments.(1638)\r\n\r\n(M837)\r\n\r\nThe following day (18 Dec.) the prince himself entered London, and the\r\ncouncil, having heard of his arrival, immediately despatched the sheriffs\r\nand the common sergeant to learn when his highness would be pleased to\r\nreceive a deputation from the city. It was arranged that the aldermen and\r\ntheir deputies and one or two members of the council of each ward,\r\naccording to the number of its representatives, should form the\r\ndeputation.(1639) The lord mayor (Chapman) being indisposed was unable to\r\nattend. He had recently been seized with a fit of apoplexy whilst trying\r\nthe terrible Jeffreys, who had been discovered and apprehended in disguise\r\nat Wapping. But Treby, the recorder, was there, and made a speech on the\r\nCity’s behalf.(1640)\r\n\r\n(M838) (M839)\r\n\r\nBy this time James, who had been foiled in his first attempt to reach the\r\ncoast, and had returned to London, had, with the connivance of the Prince\r\nof Orange, been more successful in a second attempt, and had crossed over\r\nto France, where he spent the remainder of his days. The country was\r\ntherefore left without king, parliament or legal system for its\r\ngovernment. In London the Corporation of the city was almost the only\r\nauthority that remained unaffected by the king’s abdication; and it is\r\nsignificant as well of its power as of the respect which that body\r\ncommanded that when William was endeavouring to form an authoritative\r\nassembly by summoning all the members who had ever sat in parliament under\r\nCharles II,(1641) he likewise desired that the lord mayor of the city, the\r\nentire Court of Aldermen and fifty representatives of the Common Council\r\nshould attend.(1642) This assembly met on the 26th December, and after due\r\nconsultation decided to adopt the same procedure as was adopted in 1660\r\nbefore the return of Charles II. As there was no king there could be no\r\nwrits for a parliament, but William could call a Convention, which would\r\nbe a parliament in everything but name. A Convention was accordingly\r\nsummoned to meet on the 22nd January, 1689. The election of the city\r\nmembers to serve in the convention was ordered to take place on Wednesday\r\nthe 9th January,(1643) when the choice of the citizens fell upon their\r\nformer well-tried representatives, Sir Patience Ward, Sir Robert Clayton,\r\nPilkington (who had regained his liberty in August, 1686)(1644) and Love.\r\n\r\n(M840)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime (8 Jan.) the prince wrote to the civic authorities setting\r\nforth the inadequacy of the revenue to supply three pressing wants. These\r\nwere the maintenance of the navy, the partial disbandment of the army and\r\nthe furnishing of a force for the speedy relief of the Protestants in\r\nIreland. He desired the City, therefore, to advance him such a sum as\r\ncould be \"conveniently spared.\"(1645) The City was still to keep up its\r\ncharacter as the purse of the nation. The Common Council, having heard the\r\nletter read, at once resolved to assist the prince to the utmost of their\r\npower. A committee was appointed to settle with the revenue officers the\r\nnature of the security, and orders were given for precepts to be sent to\r\nthe aldermen to raise subscriptions in the various wards.(1646) Sir Peter\r\nRich, who had recently been re-instated in the office of city chamberlain\r\nfrom which he had been ousted, was instructed to pay into the exchequer\r\nall money received on account of the loan, and to strike tallies for the\r\nsame in his own name in trust for the use of the several lenders. Ten days\r\nlater (18 Jan.) the committee reported the steps taken for the security of\r\nrepayment of the money already paid into the exchequer, and the council\r\nrecommended that similar steps should be taken with respect to those sums\r\nyet to be paid in. It was at the same time unanimously agreed to ask the\r\nPrince to dinner in the city, and the recorder, the sheriffs and the\r\ncommon sergeant were instructed to wait on his highness and learn his\r\npleasure.(1647)\r\n\r\n(M841)\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd January the Convention met. On the 28th the Commons declared\r\nthe throne to be vacant, and on the 6th February a vote to similar effect\r\nwas passed by the Lords. Some over-zealous inhabitants of the city had in\r\nthe meanwhile prepared a petition, which they purposed presenting to the\r\nHouse of Lords, praying that the crown might be offered to the Prince of\r\nOrange and his consort. The prince ordered the lord mayor to put a stop to\r\nsuch proceedings, and a precept (200 copies of which were ordered to be\r\nprinted) was accordingly issued to this effect.(1648)\r\n\r\n(M842)\r\n\r\nA Declaration of Rights was drawn up condemning the unconstitutional acts\r\nof James II, and offering to settle the crown on William and Mary and\r\ntheir children, with remainders over. On the 13th February this offer was\r\naccepted,(1649) and the prince and princess were forthwith proclaimed king\r\nand queen with the usual ceremony. The next day the Common Council\r\nunanimously agreed to wait upon their majesties and congratulate them upon\r\ntheir accession to the throne.(1650)\r\n\r\n(M843)\r\n\r\nAt the coronation banquet of the king and queen, which took place on the\r\n11th April, the masters of the twelve principal livery companies were for\r\nthe first time nominated by the Court of Aldermen to join with the lord\r\nmayor in assisting the chief butler,(1651) and they continued to be so\r\nnominated on like occasions up to the coronation of George IV, when in\r\nconsequence of a change of masters taking place between the time of their\r\nnomination and the day of the coronation, the new masters presented a\r\npetition to the Court of Claims praying to have their names inserted in\r\nthe place of the former masters whose term of office had expired. This\r\npetition was opposed by the Remembrancer, on behalf of the City, on the\r\nground that the masters of the livery companies enjoyed no peculiar right\r\nto serve on such occasions, and after some deliberation the commissioners\r\ndeclined to interfere, inasmuch as the power of nominating the twelve\r\ncitizens rested absolutely with the Court of Aldermen.(1652) The lord\r\nmayor and swordbearer were resplendent at the coronation ceremony in new\r\ncrimson and damask gowns, whilst the city’s plate—again lent for the\r\noccasion—added lustre to the banquet.(1653)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M844)\r\n\r\nThe Convention having been converted by a formal Act into a true\r\nparliament (23 Feb.),(1654) one of the first motions put to the House was\r\nthat a special committee should be appointed to consider the violations of\r\nthe liberties and franchises of all the corporations of the kingdom, \"and\r\nparticularly of the city of London.\" The motion was lost by a majority of\r\n24.(1655) The House nevertheless resolved to bring in a Bill for repealing\r\nthe Corporation Act, and ten days later (5 March) the Grand Committee of\r\nGrievances reported to the House its opinion (1) that the rights of the\r\ncity of London in the election of sheriffs in the year 1682 were invaded\r\nand that such invasion was illegal and a grievance, and (2) that the\r\njudgment given upon the _Quo Warranto_ against the city was illegal and a\r\ngrievance. The committee’s opinion on these two points (among others) was\r\nendorsed by the House, and on the 16th March it ordered a Bill to be\r\nbrought in to restore all corporations to the state and condition they\r\nwere in on the 29th May, 1660, and to confirm the liberties and franchises\r\nwhich at that time they respectively held and enjoyed.(1656)\r\n\r\n(M845)\r\n\r\nA special committee appointed (5 March) to investigate the nature of the\r\ncity’s grievances, and to discover who were the authors and advisers of\r\nthem, presented, on the 29th May, a long report to the House,(1657) giving\r\nthe whole story of the election of sheriffs in June, 1682, and of\r\nPritchard’s election to the mayoralty in the following September; of the\r\nfines that had been imposed on Pilkington, Shute, Bethell, Cornish and\r\nothers for so-called riots whilst engaged in asserting the rights of the\r\ncitizens; of Papillon having been cast in damages to the amount of £10,000\r\nat the suit of Pritchard, and of other matters which led up to the\r\nproceedings under the _Quo Warranto_, when, as the committee had\r\ndiscovered, two of the justices of the King’s Bench—Pemberton and\r\nDolben—were removed from the court because their opinion was found to be\r\nin favour of the city. The committee refer to the City’s Records in\r\nsupport of the claim of the lord mayor to elect one of the sheriffs, and\r\nsay \"that from the twenty-first of Edward the IIId unto the year 1641 the\r\nway of making sheriffs was that the lord mayor named one to be sheriff and\r\npresented him to the Common Hall, who did confirm him, and chose another\r\nto act with him; except in three or four years within that time, when the\r\nCommon Hall chose both the sheriffs, the persons drank to in those years\r\nby the lord mayor having refused to hold and paid their fines.\" They\r\ncapitulated to the House the various occasions on which the mayor\r\nexercised his prerogative unchallenged, and those when the Common Hall\r\nrefused to confirm the mayor’s nomination, down to 1682, when matters were\r\nbrought to a crisis by Sir John Moore claiming to have _elected_ Dudley\r\nNorth by drinking to him according to custom; and in conclusion they\r\nreported their opinion to be that Sir John Moore and Dudley North were\r\namong the \"authors of the invasion made upon the rights of the city of\r\nLondon in the election of sheriffs for the said city in the year 1682.\"\r\n\r\n(M846)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the civic authorities themselves had not been idle. The\r\nCommon Council had already (1 March) appointed a committee to take steps\r\nfor obtaining a reversal of the judgment on the _Quo Warranto_ with the\r\nassistance of the recorder and the city’s representatives in parliament.\r\nBefore the end of May a draft Bill had been prepared for the purpose and\r\nbeen submitted to the court for approval.(1658)\r\n\r\n(M847)\r\n\r\nThere was another matter pressing very heavily upon the City just now, and\r\none which later on would also claim the attention of parliament, and that\r\nwas the relationship of the civic authorities to the city orphans. By the\r\ncustom of London the mayor and aldermen were the recognised guardians of\r\nall citizens’ orphans, and as such took charge of their property until\r\nthey came of age or married. A Court of Orphans was established, with the\r\ncommon sergeant as its chief officer, which exercised the same\r\njurisdiction over the bodies and goods of orphans in the city that the\r\nCourt of Chancery exercised outside. In course of time the fund paid into\r\nthis court became very considerable, and in order to prevent it lying idle\r\nand thus deprive the orphans of interest that might accrue on their\r\nestate, the court lent large sums to the Crown on the security of\r\nexchequer bills. Could any guardian or trustee have acted more honestly or\r\nwith greater prudence? They had not reckoned, however, upon a king being\r\non the throne who should be sufficiently dishonest to stop all payments\r\nout of the exchequer in discharge of principal and interest of past loans.\r\nThis is what Charles II did, as we have seen, in 1672; and his action not\r\nonly ruined many bankers and merchants of the city, but inflicted great\r\nhardship upon the city’s fatherless children. The City’s revenue at the\r\ntime of William’s accession was little more than sufficient to meet the\r\nnecessary expenses of the municipality, to say nothing of repaying the\r\norphans their confiscated estates. This fact was recognised by the orphans\r\nthemselves, who saw no other hope but to apply to parliament for\r\nassistance with the aid of the Common Council.\r\n\r\n(M848)\r\n\r\nTo this end \"a large number\" of orphans of the city presented a petition\r\nto the court on the 1st March.(1659) Their fortunes (they said) had been\r\npaid into the Chamber of London according to the custom of the city, and\r\nthey were now left destitute of support and reduced to great hardships and\r\nextremities, very many of them having their whole portions in the Chamber.\r\nThey prayed the court, therefore, to appoint a committee to consider the\r\nwhole matter with the view of approaching parliament with some\r\nrecommendation. To this the court readily gave its consent, and a\r\ncommittee was then and there nominated.\r\n\r\n(M849)\r\n\r\nA week later (8 March) this committee made a report to the council.(1660)\r\nThey had found upon investigation that the debt owing by the Chamber was\r\nvery great, being upwards of £500,000 due on principal money to orphans\r\nand nearly £100,000 more due to others, besides \"finding money\" and\r\ninterest. The committee were of opinion that before any application was\r\nmade to parliament the City should first do what it could on its own\r\naccount for the relief of the orphans. The City’s lands of inheritance\r\nwere estimated as bringing in about £4,000 a year, subject to a charge of\r\n£500 or £600 for charitable uses, and the committee recommended that lands\r\nto the value of £3,000 a year rental should be sold. By this means it was\r\nthought that £70,000 or thereabouts would be raised, and the sum being\r\ndevoted to the relief of the orphans would be \"a good introduction to\r\nrequest a further assistance from the parliament.\" The charges of\r\nmunicipal government must be met with the residue of the \"casual profits\"\r\nof the Chamber. If parliament (the report went on to say) would be pleased\r\nto assist by granting a duty on coals and allowing the City to tax hackney\r\ncoachmen at 5_s._ a head, the whole debt, or at least the principal, might\r\nbe liquidated. A Bill which the committee had prepared for presentation to\r\nparliament for this purpose was then read and referred to the town clerk\r\nand the city solicitor, as well as to the attorney and the\r\nsolicitor-general for their opinions.\r\n\r\n(M850)\r\n\r\nThe king’s intimation to the House (1 March) that he was prepared, with\r\nits assent, to abolish the odious Hearth Tax was received with universal\r\njoy. The Commons immediately voted an address of thanks, and passed a\r\nformal resolution to stand by the king with their lives and fortunes in\r\nsupporting his alliances abroad, in the reduction of Ireland, and the\r\ndefence of the Protestant religion,(1661) whilst the Common Council of the\r\ncity resolved to present a humble address of thanks to his majesty for the\r\nwelcome relief from a tax that had been from its commencement obnoxious.\r\nThe court at the same time resolved to return its thanks to both Houses of\r\nParliament for their resolution to stand by the king.(1662) The Commons,\r\nin acknowledging the address, represented to the deputation by the mouth\r\nof the Speaker that they had taken notice of the courage and constancy\r\ndisplayed by the City in the late revolution, and more especially its\r\naction in advancing so large a sum of money to his majesty at so critical\r\na time. The City’s care for the public would never fail to receive the\r\nlike return from the Commons.(1663)\r\n\r\n(M851)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 17th March a special Court of Aldermen sat. The lord mayor,\r\nSir John Chapman, had died at ten o’clock that morning, and it became\r\nnecessary to take steps for the election of a mayor to serve for the\r\nremainder of the mayoralty year, and to secure, in the meantime, the peace\r\nof the city. Three aldermen were despatched, accompanied by the town\r\nclerk, to inform the king of the state of affairs, and to assure him that\r\ncare would be taken to prevent disorder until a new mayor should be\r\nelected. To secure this latter object a precept was at once issued by the\r\ncourt for a double watch to be kept until further orders, whilst another\r\nprecept was issued for a Common Hall to meet on the following Wednesday\r\n(20 March) for the election of a new mayor.(1664)\r\n\r\n(M852)\r\n\r\nWhen the Common Hall met the choice of the citizens fell upon their old\r\nfriend and champion, Pilkington, and Thomas Stampe; but a poll was\r\ndemanded by the supporters of two other candidates, viz., Sir John\r\nMoore—who had already served (1681-2) and in whose mayoralty there had\r\nbeen such a fight over the election of sheriffs—and Jonathan Raymond. It\r\nis said that the Tory party in the city put up Moore for re-election by\r\nway of showing their disgust at a recent resolution passed by the House of\r\nCommons to the effect that Moore had been a betrayer of the liberties of\r\nthe City during his mayoralty.(1665) But however that may be (and no\r\nrecord of such a resolution appears in the Journal of the House), the\r\nresult of the poll placed Stampe and Pilkington—with 1975 and 1973 votes\r\nrespectively—far ahead of either of the other candidates. Moore, indeed,\r\nwas at the bottom of the poll with only 780 votes, whilst Raymond only\r\npolled 930. Stampe and Pilkington having been returned to the Court of\r\nAldermen for them to select one, according to the custom, they chose\r\nPilkington, and he was accordingly admitted and sworn mayor for the\r\nremainder of the year, being presented to the Governor of the Tower by\r\norder of the king instead of before the barons of the exchequer.(1666) A\r\nfew weeks later (10 April) he received the honour of knighthood.(1667)\r\n\r\n(M853)\r\n\r\nAt Midsummer (1689) a difficulty again arose with the election of sheriffs\r\nfor the ensuing year. The Common Hall elected Christopher Lethieullier,\r\nalderman and dyer, and John Houblon, grocer,(1668) but these preferring to\r\npay a fine to serving, the Common Hall refused to elect others in their\r\nplace. The Court of Aldermen, finding themselves in a fix, sent for the\r\nattorney-general to peruse the City’s Records and to give his advice in\r\nthe matter. Lethieullier had determined to cut all connection with the\r\nCorporation, and had paid another fine to be relieved of the aldermanry of\r\nthe ward of Coleman Street. Nevertheless, by the 10th September both he\r\nand Houblon had been persuaded to change their minds, and professed\r\nthemselves ready, if the Court of Aldermen so willed, to take upon\r\nthemselves the office of sheriffs.(1669)\r\n\r\n(M854)\r\n\r\nThe wheel of fortune had taken a sudden turn. Those who had suffered\r\nduring the last two reigns for vindicating their liberties and upholding\r\nthe reformed religion, found themselves again in favour. Papillon and\r\nBethell, who had sought safety in Holland, returned to England, and the\r\nformer was appointed a commissioner for victualling the navy.(1670) In\r\nJune the attainder of Cornish was reversed by Act of Parliament,(1671) and\r\nin October, Ralph Box, who had refused to allow himself to be forced into\r\nthe shrievalty in 1682 against the wish of the citizens, had the honour,\r\nas master of the Grocers’ Company, of conferring the freedom of the\r\ncompany upon the king, who, in his turn, created Box a knight.(1672)\r\n\r\n(M855)\r\n\r\nNorth, on the other hand, was subjected to a severe cross-examination\r\nbefore a committee popularly called the \"murder committee,\" and narrowly\r\nescaped a criminal trial for having systematically packed juries during\r\nhis shrievalty. His statement that he had never troubled himself about the\r\npolitical opinions of those he had placed on the panel, but had only taken\r\ncare to have good and substantial citizens, was with difficulty\r\naccepted.(1673) Broom, who had been deprived of his coronership for\r\narresting North and Pritchard, the royalist mayor, was re-instated in\r\nJanuary, 1690.(1674)\r\n\r\n(M856)\r\n\r\nWilliam had achieved the crown of England without bloodshed. In Ireland,\r\nas well as in Scotland, he had to fight for his crown. The news that James\r\nhad landed in Ireland (12 March) created no small excitement in the city.\r\nVolunteers were called for, and were readily found. The trained bands were\r\naugmented and new officers appointed.(1675) When it was found that James\r\nwas marching to the north of Ireland, where the citizens of London held a\r\nlarge interest, the excitement was increased. On the 18th April he\r\nappeared before the walls of Londonderry, expecting the city to\r\nimmediately surrender. Thanks to the strength of those walls, repaired and\r\nfortified by the care and at the charges of the citizens of London,(1676)\r\nand still more to the stout hearts behind them, the town was able to stand\r\na long and dreary siege, with all its attendant horrors of slaughter and\r\nstarvation, and at last, after heroic resistance and patient suffering for\r\n105 days, to come off victorious. There is one name more especially\r\nhonoured in connection with the famous siege, that of George Walker, who,\r\nalthough a clergyman and advanced in years, inspired the besieged with so\r\nmuch energy and courage that from first to last there was no thought of\r\nsurrender. Attempts were made to win over the garrison by intrigue, and\r\namong the devices set on foot for establishing communication between\r\nbesiegers and the besieged was that of placing a letter in an empty shell\r\nand firing the latter into the town.(1677) When Walker made his appearance\r\nin England he was graciously received by the king, who made him a present\r\nof £5,000 and promised to have a care for the rest of the garrison.(1678)\r\nThe king afterwards desired Walker to furnish a list of the officers who\r\nhad displayed such determined courage during the siege and blockade.(1679)\r\n\r\n(M857)\r\n\r\nWhilst Londonderry was thus besieged a discovery had been made by means of\r\nintercepted letters of further designs which James hoped to carry out with\r\nthe assistance of the French king. On the 19th June Sir George Treby, who\r\nwas both the city’s recorder and the king’s attorney-general, laid before\r\nthe Common Council at his majesty’s request certain letters which had been\r\nseized on board a ship at Liverpool and forwarded by special messenger to\r\nthe government. The letters, which had already been submitted to both\r\nhouses, were now read to the Common Council, and this having been done the\r\ncouncil resolved to present an address to the king thanking him for his\r\nfavour and condescension, and assuring him that they would stand by him\r\nwith their lives and estates.(1680)\r\n\r\n(M858)\r\n\r\nMichaelmas-day this year (1689) happening to fall on Sunday, the election\r\nof a mayor for the year ensuing took place on the previous Saturday, when\r\nPilkington was re-elected.(1681) Tuesday, the 29th October, was lord\r\nmayor’s day, but why the ceremony of swearing in the lord mayor should\r\nhave been observed on that day instead of on the feast of SS. Simon and\r\nJude—the 28th October—as was the custom, is not clear. The lord mayor’s\r\nshow was (we are told) \"very splendid,\" and was witnessed by the king and\r\nqueen and the Prince of Denmark from a balcony in Cheapside. After the\r\nshow they were entertained, together with the members of both Houses and\r\nhigh officers of state, at a banquet in the Guildhall. The cost of the\r\nentertainment was defrayed by voluntary subscriptions among the aldermen\r\nand members of the Common Council.(1682) In order to prevent unpleasant\r\ncrowding the Commons were invited to make their way into the Guildhall\r\nthrough the church of St. Lawrence, Jewry.(1683) The king took occasion to\r\nknight the two sheriffs (Lethieullier and Houblon), and also Edward Clark\r\nand Francis Child, two aldermen who were chosen sheriffs the next\r\nyear.(1684)\r\n\r\n(M859)\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks of this entertainment it was found that the portrait of\r\nWilliam set up in the Guildhall had been maliciously mutilated. The crown\r\nand sceptre had been cut out of the picture by some Jacobite, and the\r\nreward of £500 offered (21 Nov.) by the Court of Aldermen failed to\r\ndiscover the perpetrator.(1685)\r\n\r\n(M860)\r\n\r\nOn the 30th October (1689) a parliamentary committee was appointed to\r\nprepare a Bill for \"restoring and confirming of corporations.\" A Bill was\r\naccordingly brought in, read for the second time and committed.(1686) The\r\nBill was mainly concerned with those corporations that had _surrendered_\r\ntheir charters, and a great struggle took place upon the committee’s\r\nreport (2 Jan., 1690) over an attempt to introduce a clause providing that\r\nevery municipal officer who had in any way been a party to the surrender\r\nof a borough’s franchises should be incapable of holding any office in\r\nthat borough for a period of seven years.(1687) The city of London had not\r\nsurrendered its charters. It preferred, as we have seen, on the advice of\r\nits Recorder, to let judgment be entered up against it, and allow its\r\nprivileges and franchises to be confiscated by process of law rather than\r\nvoluntarily surrender them. London was therefore excepted out of this\r\nBill, saving a clause touching the not taking or subscribing the oath and\r\ndeclaration.(1688)\r\n\r\n(M861)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th February, 1690, the Convention Parliament was dissolved. Its\r\ngreatest achievement had been the passing of the Bill of Rights, the third\r\nGreat Charter (as it has been called) of English liberties. The Bill of\r\nRights embodied the provisions of the Declaration of Rights, and strictly\r\nregulated the succession to the crown. It constituted the title-deed by\r\nwhich the king was thenceforth to hold his throne, and the people to enjoy\r\ntheir liberties. The late parliament had been none too liberal to William\r\nin the matter of supply. Money was much needed for carrying on war with\r\nFrance and for reducing Ireland. Extraordinary aids were voted from time\r\nto time, but the money came in so slowly that the king was fain to seek\r\nadvances from the City.(1689) A new parliament was summoned to meet on the\r\n20th March.(1690)\r\n\r\n(M862)\r\n\r\nThe election of members to serve the City in the coming parliament took\r\nplace on the 19th February, and was hotly contested. There appears to be\r\nno record extant among the City’s archives of what took place, but from a\r\npetition laid before the new House (2 April) by Pilkington (the lord\r\nmayor) and three others, viz., Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Patience Ward and\r\nSir William Ashurst(1691)—all professing more or less Whig principles—we\r\nlearn that they claimed to have been elected by the Common Hall. A poll\r\nhad been granted, and a scrutiny was in course of being held when (as they\r\ncomplained) the sheriffs declared the election to have gone against them.\r\nThe petitioners had afterwards learnt that upon the completion of the\r\nscrutiny the majority of those that had a right to vote had proved to be\r\nin their favour. They prayed therefore for relief. Their petition was\r\nreferred to the Committee of Privileges and Elections for them to consider\r\nand report thereon to the House; but nothing came of it. It was in vain\r\nthat Pilkington issued precepts to the livery companies for returns to be\r\nmade: (1) of the names of those who were on the livery at Midsummer, 1683;\r\n(2) of those who had been admitted since; (3) of those that had died since\r\n1683, or who were absent; and (4) of those who had omitted to take the\r\nprescribed oaths for a freeman or liveryman—in order to affect the\r\nscrutiny.(1692) The result was declared to be in favour of two aldermen\r\nand two commoners of distinct Tory proclivities. These were Sir William\r\nPritchard, Sir Samuel Dashwood, Sir William Turner (once an alderman and\r\nsoon to become one again) and Sir Thomas Vernon. Upon Turner’s death in\r\nFebruary, 1693, Sir John Fleet, then lord mayor, was elected in his\r\nplace.(1693) In the country the elections were carried on with the same\r\nheat as in the City,(1694) and with like result. The majority of the\r\nmembers of the new parliament were Tory.\r\n\r\n(M863)\r\n\r\nIn November last (1689) a new committee was appointed to prepare a Bill\r\nfor the reversal of the proceedings upon the _Quo Warranto_ and for the\r\nremoval of other grievances.(1695) The provisions of the Bill had been\r\nscarcely settled before the House, of its own motion, granted (8 April)\r\nleave for a Bill to be brought in to reverse the judgment on the _Quo\r\nWarranto_ against the City as arbitrary and illegal, and appointed a\r\ncommittee to prepare such a Bill.(1696) A Bill was accordingly prepared,\r\nwas brought in, and passed the first and second reading on the 14th\r\nApril.(1697) On the 7th May it passed the committee stage and was ordered\r\nto be engrossed, and on the following day it passed and was ordered to be\r\ncarried up to the House of Lords.(1698) On the 14th the Bill passed the\r\nLords without amendment, after counsel for the City had been heard during\r\nits progress through the House.(1699)\r\n\r\n(M864)\r\n\r\nPursuant to provisions of the Act (sec. 10) thus passed an election of\r\nmayor, sheriffs and city chamberlain took place on the 26th May, and an\r\nelection of a Common Council on the 10th June following. Such as were then\r\nelected were according to the statute to hold office not only for the\r\nremainder of the usual term, but to continue in office throughout the year\r\nensuing. On the 26th May Pilkington was again elected mayor, although the\r\nmajority of votes in Common Hall was in favour of Sir Jonathan\r\nRaymond,(1700) whilst Edward Clark, mercer, and Francis Child, goldsmith,\r\nwere chosen sheriffs.(1701) Sir Peter Rich was re-elected chamberlain by a\r\nnarrow majority over the head of Leonard Robinson, who had ousted him the\r\nprevious Midsummer,(1702) but he was not admitted to office, his rival\r\nbeing imposed upon the citizens as chamberlain in spite of his having been\r\nin the minority.\r\n\r\n(M865)\r\n\r\nWhen the elections for a new Common Council took place on the 10th June\r\nthere were severe contests in several of the wards between the \"Church\r\nparty\" and the Whigs, involving irregularities which led to disputes\r\nbetween the aldermen and the Common Council.(1703) The working of the new\r\nAct, as a matter of fact, gave rise to much dissatisfaction, and scarcely\r\nwas it passed before the Court of Aldermen resolved (27 May) to take\r\ncounsel’s opinion upon some of its clauses.(1704)\r\n\r\n(M866) (M867)\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs was at length brought to the notice of parliament by\r\na petition subscribed by members of the Common Council and presented to\r\nthe House of Commons on the 3rd December.(1705) The petitioners explained\r\nto the House that they had conceived and hoped that the late Act would\r\nhave restored the city to its ancient rights and privileges. It had,\r\nhowever, done quite the contrary. They then proceeded to relate how,\r\nnotwithstanding the Act, several aldermen of the city who had been\r\nappointed by commissions under the late king continued to act as such by\r\nvirtue of certain doubtful expressions in the Act; that by their illegally\r\nassumed authority Pilkington had been declared and made mayor, although\r\nnot duly returned by the Common Hall; that by the contrivance of the said\r\nmayor and the aldermen Leonard Robinson had been made chamberlain,\r\nnotwithstanding another having been declared duly elected by the sheriffs,\r\nand the Common Hall had been thereupon dissolved. Nor was this all. The\r\npetitioners went on to complain that divers members of the Common Council\r\nhad been illegally excluded, whilst others who had been duly elected had\r\nbeen refused admittance; that the place of town clerk having been vacant\r\nfor three months and more—an office, they remind the House, of great trust\r\nin the city and one to which only the Common Council had the right of\r\nappointment—the mayor and aldermen had of their own authority appointed\r\nseveral persons to execute the office against the consent of the Common\r\nCouncil; that the petitioners had not been allowed to meet and consult\r\nabout the necessary affairs of the city according to their ancient rights\r\nand customs; and that a Common Council having met on the 3rd October, and\r\na majority of the members having agreed upon the presentation of a humble\r\naddress to parliament with the view of explaining the recent Act and\r\nsettling the rights of the city, the mayor refused to allow the question\r\nto be put and immediately dissolved the court. The petitioners therefore,\r\nfinding all their ancient rights and privileges thus invaded, prayed the\r\nHouse to grant them relief. Having heard the petition read the House\r\nordered a copy of it to be given to the mayor and aldermen,(1706) and\r\nappointed Monday, the 8th December, for hearing both parties by themselves\r\nor by counsel. Accordingly, on that day the petitioners were heard by\r\ntheir counsel, and divers witnesses were examined, after which the further\r\nhearing was postponed until the morrow. On the 9th the case of the mayor\r\nand aldermen was opened by counsel and was continued on the 10th and the\r\n11th, when by a majority of thirteen it was decided to adjourn the matter\r\nfor a week.(1707) It never was taken up again, parliament being probably\r\nunwilling to run the risk of losing the favour of those in the city who\r\nwere in power at a time when interference on its part might be the cause\r\nof stopping the flow of money into the coffers of the exchequer.(1708)\r\n\r\n(M868)\r\n\r\nAs early as January, 1690, William had made up his mind to go to Ireland\r\nin person for the purpose of reducing the country into subjection, but\r\nalthough every effort was made to push on the necessary preparations\r\nnearly six months elapsed before he was ready to set out. On the 30th May\r\nthe assistance of the City was invoked. The Common Council willingly\r\nagreed to raise money to assist the king in his enterprise,(1709) and on\r\nthe 2nd June the mayor waited on his majesty at Kensington Palace,\r\naccompanied by the recorder, the aldermen and the sheriffs, and wished him\r\na prosperous journey, promising at the same time to secure the good\r\ngovernment of the city during his absence.(1710) On the 4th William set\r\nsail, and ten days later (14 June) landed at Carrickfergus. His arrival\r\nwas a surprise to James, who flattered himself that the state of affairs\r\nin parliament and \"the distractions of the city\" would not allow of his\r\nleaving England.(1711) During the king’s absence the queen took an active\r\npart in the administration of the kingdom, and by her tact and kindliness\r\nwon many friends. As soon as it was known that William had safely landed\r\nin Ireland the sheriffs were deputed by the Court of Aldermen to attend\r\nher majesty and desire when the court might wait upon her to offer its\r\ncongratulations upon the good fortune that had so far attended the\r\nking.(1712)\r\n\r\n(M869)\r\n\r\nThe defeat of a combined English and Dutch fleet off Beachy Head on the\r\nlast day of June caused a great commotion, although some compensation was\r\nfound in the news of William’s victory at the Boyne. Seeing that a French\r\nforce might any day be expected in England, the government, as was its\r\nwont, turned to the city of London. On the 7th July the mayor, the\r\naldermen and some members of the Court of Lieutenancy(1713) obeyed a\r\nsummons to attend upon her majesty in council. The state of affairs having\r\nbeen fully explained to them, they were asked as to the numerical strength\r\nof the City’s militia, and more especially as to the number of horse and\r\ndragoons the City could raise on an emergency. The mayor professed himself\r\nunable to give a reply off hand to these questions, and desired time to\r\nconsult the Common Council on the matter.(1714) Whatever political or\r\nreligious differences existed at the time of the recent city elections,\r\nthese were now laid aside in the face of a common danger, and \"London set\r\nthe example of concert and of exertion.\"(1715) No time was lost. Already\r\nthe mayor had, in pursuance of an order from the Privy Council (3 July)\r\nissued precepts to the several aldermen (5 July) for search to be made in\r\nprivate as well as public stables for horses for military service.(1716)\r\nOn the 10th the Court of Aldermen resolved to apply to the hackney-men\r\nplying their trade in and about London, and to learn from them the number\r\nof horses they could supply on an emergency like the present, and upon\r\nwhat terms.(1717) The Common Council at the same time resolved to raise a\r\nregiment of horse and another of dragoons.(1718) The next day (11 July)\r\nthe mayor and aldermen and a deputation of the lieutenancy again waited\r\nupon her majesty sitting in council and assured her of their loyalty. The\r\ncity militia, the queen was informed, consisted of about 9,000 men, well\r\nequipt and ready for active service, and six regiments of auxiliaries were\r\nabout to be raised. As to the horse and dragoons, the Common Council had\r\nunanimously resolved to raise by voluntary contributions a large regiment\r\nof horse and 1,000 dragoons, and to maintain them for a month if need be.\r\nWe have seen how jealous in former days the city had been in the matter of\r\nappointing its own officers over its own forces, but now all signs of\r\njealousy were wanting, and the queen herself was desired to appoint\r\nofficers over the cavalry that was in course of being raised.(1719) On the\r\n21st her majesty reviewed the city militia in Hyde Park, and expressed\r\nherself as much gratified.(1720)\r\n\r\n(M870)\r\n\r\nThe City was ready not only with men but money. On the 22nd July the\r\nCommon Council was asked to assist her majesty by making a speedy loan of\r\n£100,000 \"or what more can be advanced\" on the security of the hereditary\r\nrevenue. The court at once gave its consent, and precepts were issued to\r\nthe aldermen to raise the money in their respective wards without\r\ndelay.(1721)\r\n\r\n(M871)\r\n\r\nFortunately for England the French fleet, which kept hovering for more\r\nthan a month off the south coast in the hope of being able to effect a\r\nlanding, at last was seen to be sailing homewards. When all danger was\r\npast the queen sent for the lord mayor (15 Aug.) to thank his lordship and\r\nthe city for their readiness in advancing money and raising forces, and to\r\ninform him that there was no immediate necessity for the horse and\r\ndragoons which were then being raised.(1722)\r\n\r\n(M872)\r\n\r\nHearing of the danger that was threatening England, William had serious\r\nthoughts of leaving Ireland and returning home in July.(1723) He did not\r\nreturn, however, before September. Landing in England on Saturday, the\r\n6th, he proceeded by easy stages to London, where he arrived on the 10th,\r\nand took up his residence at Kensington Palace. The bells of the city rang\r\nout a welcome, bonfires were lighted, and the tower guns fired a\r\nsalvo.(1724) On the 9th the sheriffs were instructed by the Court of\r\nAldermen to wait upon his majesty to learn when and where he would be\r\npleased to see them.(1725) An appointment having been made for Thursday\r\nmorning (11 Sept.) the mayor and aldermen proceeded to Whitehall and\r\ncongratulated his majesty on his safe return, their example being followed\r\nby the bishop and the clergy of London in the afternoon of the same\r\nday.(1726) The Common Council, not to be outdone in display of loyalty,\r\nalso craved an audience, and on the 18th were permitted to wait upon his\r\nmajesty to offer their congratulations.(1727)\r\n\r\n(M873)\r\n\r\nEarly in 1691 William again left England for the purpose of attending a\r\ncongress at the Hague. Before leaving he gave an audience to the mayor and\r\naldermen, who desired to wish him a prosperous voyage. He took occasion to\r\nthank them for the care they had formerly taken of the city during his\r\nabsence and desired them to do the same again.(1728) A few days later (16\r\nJan.) he embarked at Gravesend and did not return to England until the\r\nfollowing April, when he received the usual welcome from the city.(1729)\r\n\r\n(M874) (M875)\r\n\r\nHis presence was much needed, for the Jacobites were becoming more\r\ndangerous every day. One plot, of which Lord Preston was the ruling\r\nspirit,(1730) had been discovered before William left for the Hague, and\r\nanother was on foot. Nevertheless the state of affairs on the continent\r\nwould not allow of his remaining long in England; so, after a brief stay\r\nhe again set sail for Holland (2 May), with Marlborough in his train, to\r\nopen a regular campaign against the King of France.\r\n\r\n(M876)\r\n\r\nThe king had not been gone long before the queen sent to the City (18\r\nJune) to borrow £120,000 to be employed in the reduction of Ireland, a\r\nbusiness left to the Dutch General Ginkell, afterwards created Earl of\r\nAthlone, to carry out. The sum of £75,000 was to be advanced on the\r\nsecurity of the parliamentary imposts on wine, vinegar and tobacco, and\r\nthe remainder of the loan on the security of similar imposts on East India\r\ngoods and other commodities.(1731) The Common Council readily consented to\r\nfind the money, notwithstanding its having so recently as February last\r\nadvanced no less a sum than £200,000 towards fitting out the fleet.(1732)\r\nThese advances were, however, still insufficient to meet the necessities\r\nof the times. Long before the year was out the citizens were called upon\r\nto lend another £200,000 to assist in paying off the ships of war that\r\nwere about to lay up for the winter.(1733) In the following year (1692),\r\nwhen parliament laid the foundation of the National Debt and decided on\r\nborrowing a million of money for the support of the war, the City was\r\nasked at different periods to advance no less than three sums of\r\n£200,000(1734) and one of £100,000.(1735)\r\n\r\n(M877)\r\n\r\nIn view of the elections which were to take place on Midsummer-day, 1691,\r\na motion had been made in the Common Council on the 18th June (immediately\r\nafter the court had agreed to lend the queen £120,000) for repealing the\r\nclause in the Act of Common Council of the 6th June, 1683, touching the\r\nconfirmation of one of the sheriffs of the city and county of Middlesex\r\nchosen by the mayor for the time being. A debate thereupon arising the\r\nprevious question was put, and was declared by the lord mayor to be\r\ncarried. A poll, however, was demanded, when the previous question was\r\nlost by 35 votes to 30, and the original motion being afterwards put was\r\ncarried by 30 votes to 29.(1736) Such is the narrative of what took place\r\nin the Common Council on the 18th June, 1691, as related in the Journal of\r\nthe court, according to which the clause in the Act of 1683 would have\r\nbeen repealed. We know however, as a matter of fact, that the clause was\r\nnot repealed until three years later.(1737) An explanation is afforded us\r\nby Luttrell, the diarist, who says that the minority against repealing the\r\nclause immediately withdrew from the court \"so there were not enough left\r\nto make a Common Council, so the Act continues in force.\"(1738) He adds\r\nthat the mayor (Pilkington) thereupon went to the Bridge House and drank\r\nto Sir William Ashurst as a \"recommendatory sheriff\" for the ensuing year\r\nto hold office only on condition that the choice should be approved by the\r\nCommon Hall, \"otherwise no good sheriff.\" When Midsummer-day arrived, the\r\ncommon sergeant having asked the Court of Aldermen for instructions as to\r\nhow to proceed to the elections, was ordered to \"pursue such directions as\r\nhe should receive from the sheriffes, and in his report of the elections,\r\nto declare it as the report of the said sheriffes.\" The court further\r\nordered that the Common Hall should be opened by proclamation in these\r\nwords: \"You good men of the livery of the several companies of the city\r\nsummoned to appear here this day for the election of sheriffs and other\r\nofficers usually chosen at this time, draw near and give your attendance,\r\netc.\"(1739) The claims of the Livery in Common Hall to elect both sheriffs\r\nbeing thus allowed, the electors were satisfied to pay the mayor the\r\ncompliment of electing Sir William Ashurst, his nominee, to be one of the\r\nsheriffs, whilst choosing Richard Levett to be the other. There was\r\nanother candidate in the person of William Gore. A poll was demanded and\r\nallowed, the result of which was declared on the 2nd July, when it\r\nappeared that Ashurst had polled 3,631 votes, Levett 2,252 and Gore 1,774.\r\nA keen contest again took place between Sir Peter Rich and Leonard\r\nRobinson for the office of chamberlain, in which the latter came off\r\nvictorious.(1740)\r\n\r\n(M878) (M879)\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the next year (5 April, 1692) the Court of Aldermen had\r\nbefore them a Bill, the object of which was to settle the election and\r\nconfirmation of sheriffs for the future. After due deliberation amongst\r\nthemselves, and after consulting the attorney-general upon its provisions,\r\nthe Bill was recommended to the Common Council to be passed as an Act of\r\nthat court.(1741) Of the particulars of the Bill we are not informed. It\r\nwas laid for the first time before the Common Council on the 6th May, when\r\nit was referred to a committee. On the 26th ult. it was read the first\r\ntime and on the 31st a second time, but upon the question being put\r\nwhether the Bill should be then read a third time it passed in the\r\nnegative,(1742) and nothing more is heard of it.\r\n\r\n(M880)\r\n\r\nA Bill for regulating the election of members of the Common Council itself\r\nmet with better success. Of late years divers inhabitants of the city who\r\nwere not freemen (and among them the doctors and other gentlemen of\r\nDoctors’ Commons) had been in the habit of exercising the franchise at\r\nwardmotes, to the prejudice of freemen, to whom alone belonged the right\r\nof voting. Many complaints having been made to the Common Council of the\r\nrights of freemen having been thus infringed,(1743) an Act was at length\r\npassed (26 Oct., 1692) declaring that the nomination of aldermen and the\r\nelection of common councilmen for the several wards of the city\r\nappertained only to freemen, being householders in the city, and paying\r\nscot and bearing lot, a list of whom was thenceforth to be prepared and\r\nkept by the beadle of each ward, as well as a separate list of the other\r\nhouseholders. A copy of the Act was to be appended to all precepts for\r\nwardmotes, and the provisions of the Act were to be publicly read to the\r\nassembled electors.(1744) At the next election of a Common Council, which\r\ntook place in December, the Whigs, we are told, were, after a hard fight,\r\nreturned by \"above 50 more voices than last year.\"(1745)\r\n\r\n(M881)\r\n\r\nWhen William returned from abroad in October, 1691, it was to find Ireland\r\ncompletely subjugated. The mayor and aldermen waited upon his majesty at\r\nWhitehall, as usual, to congratulate him upon his safe arrival. The king\r\nthanked them for the care they had taken of the city during his absence,\r\nand more particularly for supplying the queen with the sum of £200,000 to\r\nenable her to carry on the necessary affairs of the kingdom, and bestowed\r\nthe honour of knighthood on Richard Levett, one of the sheriffs, Sir\r\nWilliam Ashurst, the other sheriff, being already knighted. Leaving\r\nWhitehall, the mayor and aldermen next proceeded to Kensington to offer\r\ntheir compliments to the queen and to thank her majesty for her good\r\ngovernment during the king’s absence.(1746) A fortnight later (4 Nov.) the\r\nCommon Council resolved to pay their respects also to the king and to\r\ncongratulate him upon the success of his arms in Ireland.(1747)\r\n\r\n(M882)\r\n\r\nThe king did not long remain in England. Early in March of the following\r\nyear (1692) he returned to the Hague to make preparations for renewing the\r\nwar against France both by sea and land, leaving the queen to carry on the\r\ngovernment in England. On the morning of the 12th March the mayor and\r\naldermen, accompanied by the recorder, proceeded to Whitehall to offer the\r\nqueen their congratulations upon the receipt of news of the king’s safe\r\narrival in Holland, as well as of her majesty’s assumption of the reins of\r\ngovernment. The recorder assured her of the City’s loyalty, and desired\r\nher only to put it to the test.(1748)\r\n\r\n(M883)\r\n\r\nThe City had not long to wait. Within a week (18 March) application was\r\nmade to the Common Council, on behalf of the queen, for a loan of\r\n£200,000.(1749) This was the first of the three loans of that amount\r\nalready mentioned as having been advanced this year. The council readily\r\nconsented to raise the money, and so successful were their efforts that\r\nwithin four days one-half of the whole loan was already paid into the\r\nexchequer. By the king’s orders the whole of the £200,000 was kept intact\r\n\"for some extraordinary occasion.\"(1750)\r\n\r\n(M884)\r\n\r\nSuch an occasion was at hand. Whilst England and Holland were preparing to\r\nmake a joint attack on France, France had been getting ready a navy for a\r\ndescent on England with the view of restoring James to the throne. As soon\r\nas intelligence arrived of a threatened invasion great excitement\r\nprevailed. This was towards the close of April (1692). The trained bands\r\nwere called out, not only in the city, but throughout the country, and\r\nmore especially in those counties bordering on the coast. The Court of\r\nLieutenancy had orders to administer the oaths to every officer and man,\r\nand any that refused were to be instantly cashiered and disarmed. The same\r\nwith Papists and all suspicious persons found in the city. The oaths were\r\nto be tendered to them, and if any refused to take them they were to be\r\ndisarmed and banished ten miles from the city.(1751) The mayor issued\r\ninstructions for closing coffee-houses in the city on Sundays.(1752)\r\nTroops that had been ordered to Flanders were now countermanded, and a\r\ncamp was formed at Southampton.(1753) The lord mayor was given a\r\ncommission as general of all the city’s forces—trained bands and\r\nauxiliaries—during the king’s absence abroad, and on the 10th May was\r\ncomplimented by her majesty at the close of a review held in Hyde\r\nPark.(1754)\r\n\r\n(M885)\r\n\r\nAt length—on the 19th May—the French fleet, which was to cover the\r\ninvasion of England, met the combined Dutch and English fleet off La\r\nHogue, and was so signally beaten that all further thought of an invasion\r\nhad to be abandoned. News of the victory reached London on the 21st, and\r\nwas received with every demonstration of joy. Medical aid was at once\r\ndespatched to tend the sick and wounded at Portsmouth, whilst the\r\nhospitals were got ready to receive those who should be brought to\r\nLondon.(1755)\r\n\r\n(M886)\r\n\r\nThe formal announcement of the victory to the Common Council of the city\r\n(26 May) was thought a fitting opportunity for asking for a further loan\r\nof £100,000 to enable her majesty to pay and \"gratify\" the seamen who had\r\nso gallantly warded off invasion and to refit the fleet. It need scarcely\r\nbe said that the money was readily promised.(1756)\r\n\r\n(M887)\r\n\r\nThis sum, however, proved altogether inadequate for the purpose, so that\r\nby the end of August the queen was compelled to send for the mayor and\r\naldermen and ask for £200,000 more. The mayor promised to summon a Common\r\nCouncil at an early date to consider the matter, and to further her\r\nmajesty’s wishes to the best of his power.(1757) A court accordingly met\r\non Tuesday the 6th September and agreed to raise the money, as usual, by\r\nsubscriptions in the wards and from the livery companies,(1758) and within\r\na very few days the mayor was able to signify to the queen the City’s\r\ncompliance with her wishes, and to inform her that £70,000 had been\r\nalready subscribed.(1759)\r\n\r\n(M888)\r\n\r\nOn the 18th October William once more set foot in England, and at seven\r\no’clock in the evening of the 20th he passed through the city—the houses\r\nof which were illuminated and the bells set ringing—to Kensington. Two\r\ndays later (22 Oct.) the mayor and aldermen went in state to wait upon his\r\nmajesty to congratulate him upon his safe return, and to ask him to favour\r\nthem with his presence on the coming lord mayor’s day, when Sir John Fleet\r\nentered on his year of office.(1760) The king accepted the City’s\r\ninvitation and conferred the honour of knighthood upon Salathiel Lovell,\r\nwho in June last had been chosen recorder on the occasion of Sir George\r\nTreby being appointed chief justice of the common pleas.(1761)\r\n\r\n(M889)\r\n\r\nThe entertainment, which was given at the expense of the aldermen and not\r\ncharged in any way to the city’s Chamber,(1762) was made the occasion by\r\nthe king of suggesting another city loan of £200,000, making the third\r\nloan of the kind within the year, besides another loan of £100,000. The\r\nking’s wishes were laid before the next Common Council (2 Nov.) and met\r\nwith a ready response.(1763) Before leaving the Guildhall his majesty\r\nconferred the honour of knighthood upon Alderman Gore, Alderman Houblon,\r\nLeonard Robinson, the city chamberlain, and others.(1764)\r\n\r\n(M890)\r\n\r\nScarcely had William turned his back on England in the spring of the\r\nfollowing year (1693) in order to prosecute the war with France before the\r\nCommon Council was asked (25 April) to advance another sum of £200,000\r\nupon the credit of a recent Act of Parliament authorising the raising of a\r\nmillion of money for military purposes.(1765) The money, which was wanted\r\nfor the purpose of paying the wages of seamen and for refitting the fleet,\r\nwas immediately voted.\r\n\r\n(M891) (M892)\r\n\r\nThe same ill-success followed the arms of the allied forces this year on\r\nthe continent as in previous years. But the fall of Mons in 1691, of Namur\r\nin 1692, and the bloody field of Landen this year were far less disastrous\r\nin their effect to the Londoner than the damage inflicted on the Turkey\r\nfleet of merchantmen in Lagos Bay. For months the fleet, valued at several\r\nmillions, had been waiting to be convoyed to the Mediterranean, and so\r\ngreat had been the delay in providing it with a sufficiently strong escort\r\nthat the city merchant had already lost much of the profit he had looked\r\nto derive from the voyage. When at length a convoy was provided it was on\r\nthe understanding that the greater part of the force should withdraw as\r\nsoon as the most critical point of the voyage should be passed, leaving\r\nbut barely twenty sail, under Rooke, to accompany the merchantmen through\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar. It was in vain that Rooke protested. The danger\r\nwas the more hazardous inasmuch as no one could say where the French fleet\r\nwas lying. Nevertheless, on the 5th June the main fleet parted company and\r\nreturned to the Channel, leaving Rooke, with only seventeen men-of-war, to\r\nlook to his charge as best he could. As time went on and no news could be\r\ngot of the movements of the French fleet the underwriters in the city got\r\nmore and more nervous.(1766) The end is well known. At Lagos the English\r\nadmiral found his passage blocked by the French fleet. A sharp fight\r\nensued, during which many merchantmen succeeded in making good their\r\nescape, others were burnt or sunk. \"Never within the memory of man,\" wrote\r\nMacaulay, \"had there been in the city a day of more gloom and agitation\r\nthan that on which the news of the encounter in the Bay of Lagos arrived.\r\nMany traders, an eye-witness said, went away from the Royal Exchange as\r\npale as if they had received sentence of death.\" The Turkey merchants in\r\ntheir distress sent a deputation to the queen.(1767) The deputation met\r\nwith a kind reception, and was assured by Somers, on the queen’s behalf,\r\nof her majesty’s deep sympathy. An enquiry, he said, had already been set\r\non foot as to the cause of the recent disaster, and care would be taken to\r\nprevent its recurrence.\r\n\r\n(M893)\r\n\r\nOn the 15th August, after voting a loan of £300,000 to her majesty for\r\npayment of the forces in Flanders, the Common Council prepared an address\r\nto the queen, in which they expressed their deep sense of the infinite\r\ngoodness of God in preserving the king through all the perils of war, and\r\nthanked her for the sympathy she had displayed with the ruined merchants\r\nand for the steps she had taken for the better protection of trade in\r\nfuture. To this address a clause was added at the next meeting of the\r\ncourt (17 Aug.) referring to their cheerful readiness to advance a further\r\nsum of money for her majesty’s necessities, and assuring her of their firm\r\nresolution to continue upon all occasions to support her authority and\r\ngovernment against all persons to the uttermost of their power.(1768)\r\n\r\n(M894)\r\n\r\nIn October the Court of Aldermen invited her majesty to dinner on lord\r\nmayor’s day—the day on which Sir William Ashurst entered into office. On\r\nthis occasion it was agreed that the mayor and sheriffs should bear the\r\nwhole expense of the entertainment, without the aid of the aldermen.(1769)\r\nAshurst appears to have been unpopular with his brother aldermen. On the\r\nfeast of SS. Simon and Jude (28 Oct.), when the usual court was held for\r\nswearing in the new lord mayor, no less than ten aldermen absented\r\nthemselves. Whether this was intended for a studied insult or was the\r\nresult of mere negligence does not appear. But, however that may be, the\r\ncourt marked its sense of their conduct by fining six of the delinquents\r\n100 marks a-piece, whilst it took time to consider the case of the other\r\nfour, they being members of parliament.(1770)\r\n\r\n(M895)\r\n\r\nThe 29th October falling on Sunday, the lord mayor’s banquet took place on\r\nthe following Monday at the hall of the Grocers’ Company,(1771) but the\r\nqueen was unable to attend as she had gone to meet the king, who had\r\nlanded at Harwich on Sunday afternoon.(1772) On the 2nd November the mayor\r\nand aldermen attended at Whitehall to offer their congratulations upon his\r\nsafe return. His success, said the city’s Recorder, addressing his\r\nmajesty, had not answered the expectations and hopes of his subjects,\r\nnevertheless they were assured that God, who had protected him in so many\r\ndangers, would in His own good time work a deliverance. The king received\r\nthem very graciously, gave each his hand to kiss, and conferred the honour\r\nof knighthood upon Thomas Abney, one of the sheriffs.(1773)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M896)\r\n\r\nSoon after parliament resumed its sittings (7 Nov., 1693) the attention of\r\nthe Commons was drawn to a high-handed act done by the wealthy and\r\nautocratic company known as the East India Company. For nearly a century\r\nthat body of merchants had enjoyed a monopoly of trade with the East\r\nIndies and had frustrated all attempts of \"interlopers\" to share their\r\nprivileges. It had received its first charter at the hands of Queen\r\nElizabeth on the 31st December, 1600, but it was not until after the\r\nRestoration, when its privileges were confirmed by another charter, that\r\nit began to enter upon a career of such unexampled prosperity as to become\r\nat once an object of envy and fear. The management of the company’s\r\naffairs rested in the hands of a small number of proprietors, the leading\r\nspirit for many years being Sir Josiah Child, one of the merchant princes\r\nof the city. With him was associated, at least for a time, Thomas\r\nPapillon, the zealous Whig. He had become a member of the company as early\r\nas 1657, and for many years took an active part in its management. He was\r\none of the directors from 1663 to 1670; was re-appointed in 1675, but lost\r\nhis seat on the board the following year, as also did Child, through the\r\nintervention of Charles the Second, who disliked their Whiggish\r\nprinciples. After a short interval both of them recovered their positions,\r\nand in 1680 and 1681 Papillon was deputy governor.(1774) When Child turned\r\ncourtier and threw over his old colleagues, Papillon and other Whig\r\nshareholders sold their stock and severed their connection with the\r\ncompany. Their places on the directorate were filled up by others who were\r\ndevoted to Child and his policy, and thenceforth Child became the autocrat\r\nof the company. \"The treasures of the company were absolutely at his\r\ndisposal.... A present of ten thousand guineas was graciously received\r\nfrom him by Charles. Ten thousand more were accepted by James, who readily\r\nconsented to become a holder of stock.... Of what the dictator expended no\r\naccount was asked by his colleagues.\"(1775) His policy was so far\r\nsuccessful as to obtain a decision in favour of the company’s privileges\r\nfrom Jeffreys and a renewal of its charter from James. Just at a time when\r\nthe prospects of the company looked brightest a sudden change of fortune\r\nwas occasioned by the Revolution and the subsequent accession of the Whigs\r\nto power. The outcry raised by the general merchants of the city against\r\nthe company became louder than ever, not so much on account of the company\r\nbeing in possession of a monopoly as because it was ruled by a single\r\nindividual, and his rule, while benefiting himself and his creatures, was\r\nprejudicial to the public welfare. To this outcry Papillon, who had now\r\nreturned from exile, added his voice and thereby subjected himself to a\r\ncharge of inconsistency.\r\n\r\n(M897)\r\n\r\nThere was but one remedy for the existing evil in the opinion of the\r\nmajority, and that was to form a new company from which Child should be\r\nexcluded. Without waiting for an Act of Parliament many traders in the\r\ncity formed themselves into an association which, although unrecognised by\r\nlaw, acquired the designation of the New Company, and commenced to carry\r\non its business at the hall of the Skinners’ Company in Dowgate. For years\r\nthe city was kept in a ferment by the rivalry existing between the Old and\r\nthe New Company, between Leadenhall Street and Skinners’ Hall, the former\r\nbeing supported by the Tories, the latter by the Whigs.\r\n\r\n(M898)\r\n\r\nThe sanction and assistance of parliament was sought for by both\r\ncompanies. The majority of the Commons were in favour of a compromise.\r\nThey would have retained the Old Company, but wished to remodel it and to\r\nincorporate with it the members of the New Company. Such a proceeding,\r\nhowever, Child would not listen to, and his obstinacy so provoked the\r\nHouse that in February, 1692, it presented an address to the king praying\r\nhim to dissolve the Old Company and to grant a charter to a New Company on\r\nsuch terms as to his majesty’s wisdom might seem fit. The king replied\r\nthat it was a matter of very great importance to the trade of the kingdom;\r\nthat he could not be expected to give an immediate answer, but he would\r\nconsider the matter and give an answer shortly.(1776) The company sought\r\nto avert the impending danger by offering the king the sum of £200,000 by\r\nway of loan for three years without any interest.(1777) A twelvemonth\r\nlater (Feb., 1693) the Commons again petitioned the king to dissolve the\r\nOld Company upon three years’ warning;(1778) but in spite of these attacks\r\nthe company contrived to obtain a confirmation of its monopoly under the\r\nGreat Seal in the following October.(1779) This was only obtained by a\r\nlavish distribution of money.\r\n\r\n(M899)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the management of the Old Company’s affairs had been\r\nplaced ostensibly in the hands of Sir Thomas Cook,(1780) an alderman of\r\nLondon and member for Colchester, although there is reason for believing\r\nthat Child still continued to be the actual manager.\r\n\r\n(M900)\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of the order of the Privy Council for sealing the\r\ncompany’s charter, and before the king, whose return from the continent\r\nwas daily expected, could give it his sanction,(1781) the directors, in\r\nthe moment of victory, committed an act of incredible rashness which led\r\nto serious consequences. A number of city merchants had recently chartered\r\na vessel named \"Redbridge\" and placed on board a valuable cargo. Her\r\npapers showed her to be bound for a Spanish port, but suspicion pointed to\r\nher being intended for a voyage to the East Indies in contravention of the\r\ncompany’s charter. Acting on this surmise, the company procured an order\r\nfrom the Privy Council to have the vessel stopt, and stopt she accordingly\r\nwas from the 21st October until the following 9th November, each day’s\r\ndelay in sailing inflicting heavy expense on the owners. Such high-handed\r\nproceedings of the Company might create little excitement if carried out\r\non the high seas and at a distance from home, but in the port of London\r\nthey were not to be tolerated. The owners of the \"Redbridge\" laid their\r\ngrievance before the Commons (30 Dec.).(1782) They pointed out that the\r\nconduct of the East India Company was \"greatly prejudicial to all foreign\r\ntrade and navigation in general, and more particularly to the petitioners,\r\nwho by the present laws of the kingdom can have no reparation.\" They\r\nprayed, therefore, that the like inconveniences might be prevented for the\r\nfuture. Their petition was referred to a committee of the whole House,\r\ntogether with other petitions against the company, as well as the\r\ncompany’s charters. In due course the committee, with Papillon in the\r\nchair, reported that the stopping of the \"Redbridge\" was \"a grievance, a\r\ndiscouragement to trade and contrary to the known laws of the\r\nkingdom,\"(1783) and further that, in the opinion of the Common Hall, \"all\r\nthe subjects of England have equal right to trade to the East Indies\r\nunless prohibited by Act of Parliament.\" This resolution was accepted by\r\nthe House without a division,(1784) and for some years at least there\r\nnominally existed free trade with India.(1785)\r\n\r\n(M901)\r\n\r\nBetween March, 1689, and February, 1691, little appears to have been done\r\ntowards solving the difficulty of the claims of the City orphans. Another\r\ncommittee was appointed at the expiration of that time to consider the\r\nmatter, and in November, 1691, the committee reported to the Common\r\nCouncil. They recommended that certain rents of the value of £8,000 per\r\nannum should be set aside towards the payment of four per cent. per annum\r\nfor the immediate relief of the orphans, and that parliament should be\r\nasked to authorise the raising of a sum of £24,000 to be vested in the\r\nCorporation for the satisfaction of debts to existing orphans, and for\r\nsecurity of the money of orphans that should be paid into the Chamber in\r\nfuture. The recommendation of the committee was accepted by the court (20\r\nNov.), and three days later a draft petition to parliament was read and\r\napproved.(1786) The petition set forth that in the troublous times during\r\nand after the reign of Charles I the City lost divers large sums of money,\r\nand that by reason of this, as well as of the destruction of the greatest\r\npart of their estate in the great fire and their losses consequent on the\r\nillegal judgment on the _Quo Warranto_, their debts to the orphans had\r\namounted to a sum far larger than the City was able to pay without the\r\nassistance of parliament. It proceeded to lay before the House the scheme\r\nproposed by the committee, and prayed the House to assist the petitioners\r\nto raise a sufficient sum for an annual payment to be made in lieu of the\r\nsaid debts, or such other provision for the same as the House might think\r\nfit. On the 27th November leave was granted to bring in a Bill, and on the\r\n3rd December a Bill was brought in and read the first time, but nothing\r\nfurther appears to have come of it.(1787) On the 6th August, 1692, a\r\ncommittee was appointed to consider the question how best the City’s\r\nrevenues might be improved with the view to the easier discharge of\r\norphans’ claims. The committee showed itself very active, meeting at least\r\nonce and often twice a week. Nevertheless it was not until the 2nd\r\nNovember it was in a position to make a report to the Common\r\nCouncil.(1788) What was thought of the committee’s recommendations is not\r\nrecorded, but a few days later (11 Nov.) we find the court resolving to\r\npresent a petition to parliament in precisely the same terms as their\r\nformer petition.(1789)\r\n\r\n(M902)\r\n\r\nThe matter was allowed to drag on until the 17th February of the next year\r\n(1693), when a committee was appointed by the House to prepare and bring\r\nin another Bill. A Bill was accordingly brought in on the 20th, read the\r\nfirst time on the 21st, read the second time on the 22nd and committed.\r\nBefore the Bill passed through committee the City desired to be heard by\r\ncounsel against the Bill on the ground that it divested the City of all\r\nits revenues, deprived it of much of its ancient and necessary\r\njurisdiction, and would not answer the ends proposed.(1790) In March\r\nprogress was reported, but before anything further could be done the House\r\nwas prorogued.(1791)\r\n\r\n(M903)\r\n\r\nWhen the House re-assembled in November (1693) the City again presented a\r\npetition in terms similar to their former petitions. The petition having\r\nbeen referred to a committee of the whole House that committee reported\r\n(17 Feb., 1694) to the following effect,(1792) viz., that (1) a\r\nrent-charge of £8,000 per annum should be set aside out of the City’s\r\nrevenues towards payment of interest due to orphans, (2) that the City\r\nshould be permitted to raise a sum not exceeding £2,000 per annum upon\r\npersonal estates in the city to satisfy the orphans’ debts, (3) that the\r\npatentees of a new kind of glass light known as convex lights(1793) should\r\ncontribute an annual sum of £600, (4) that an additional duty of 4_d._ per\r\nchaldron should be imposed upon coal entering the port of London and 6_d._\r\nper chaldron on coals imported into the city for a term of fifty years\r\ncommencing from the determination of the duty already existing in respect\r\nof re-building St. Paul’s, (5) that an additional duty of 4_s._ should be\r\nlaid on every tun of wine entering the port of London, (6) that the\r\nimprovements about to be made in the water supply of the city(1794) should\r\nalso contribute, and lastly (7) that every person bound apprentice in the\r\ncity should contribute 2_s._6_d._, and every person made free of the city\r\n5_s._ towards the same object.\r\n\r\n(M904)\r\n\r\nA Bill(1795) was subsequently introduced embodying these resolutions, but\r\nwith an additional proviso that when the tax of 6_d._ per chaldron on\r\ncoals, to be imposed for a term of fifty years, should cease the City’s\r\nlands should be charged with an annual sum of £6,000 over and above the\r\nrent-charge of £8,000 previously mentioned. The Bill was read the first\r\nand second time on the 22nd February, and the third time on the 12th\r\nMarch. A few days later (21 March) it passed the Lords without amendment,\r\nand on the 23rd received the royal assent.(1796)\r\n\r\n(M905)\r\n\r\nOn the 6th March (1694) the lord keeper came to the Guildhall, accompanied\r\nby the lords of the treasury, to ask the Common Council for a loan of\r\n£200,000, upon security of the land tax, for naval and military purposes.\r\nThe court at once assented, and before the end of the month the whole\r\namount had been paid into the exchequer.(1797) The money was raised in the\r\nusual way from the inhabitants of each ward and from the livery companies.\r\nThe Corporation itself was by no means well off, and encouragement was\r\ngiven to anyone who could suggest a means whereby the City’s revenues\r\ncould be increased.(1798) Recourse was had, among other things, to\r\nnominating for sheriff the least suitable men for the office, and such as\r\nwould prefer paying the fine to serving. In no other way can one\r\nreasonably account for the fact that the fines for refusing to undertake\r\nthe office of sheriff amounted for this year (1694) to over £5,000.(1799)\r\n\r\n(M906)\r\n\r\nThis loan was but as a drop in the ocean compared with the necessities of\r\nthe times. The estimates for the year 1694 were enormous. The army, which\r\nwas already the largest standing force that England had ever seen, was to\r\nreceive a large increase, whilst considerable sums of money were required\r\nfor payment of arrears, no less than for the future expenses, of the navy.\r\nNotwithstanding the renewal of the land tax, the imposition of a poll-tax,\r\nthe revival of stamp duties, and the raising of a million of money by a\r\nlottery loan, there yet remained a large deficit before the estimated\r\nrevenue of the year balanced the estimated expenditure. At this juncture\r\nCharles Montague, poet, politician and _savant_, took up a scheme\r\npropounded to government three years before by William Paterson, an\r\nenterprising if not always successful Scotsman, but allowed to drop. This\r\nscheme was none other than the formation of a national bank. The idea was\r\nnot altogether a new one. Before the close of the reign of Charles II\r\nseveral plans of the kind had been suggested, some being in favour of\r\nestablishing such a bank under the immediate direction of the Crown,\r\nwhilst others were of opinion that its management should be entrusted to\r\nthe Corporation of the city. It was now proposed to raise the sum of\r\n£1,200,000 for the use of the government by way of loan at eight per cent.\r\ninterest, the subscribers being incorporated by the name of the Governor\r\nand Company of the Bank of England. The matter was introduced into\r\nparliament for the first time on the 28th March, in the shape of a Bill\r\nfor granting their majesties certain tonnage duties on wine, ale and other\r\nliquors.(1800) Although it was not easy to recognise in the terms of the\r\nBill the germ of \"the greatest commercial institution that the world had\r\never seen,\"(1801) it met with considerable opposition in the House, and\r\nstill more outside. With their recent experience of the evils arising from\r\na rich and powerful body like the East India Company, men were cautious in\r\nallowing a Corporation to be erected in their midst which, as many feared,\r\nwould absorb the wealth of the nation,(1802) and might render the Crown\r\nindependent of parliament and people. This last consideration was not\r\nunimportant, and, in order to avert the possibility of such a danger, a\r\nclause was inserted in the Bill forbidding under the severest penalties\r\nthe new Corporation advancing money to the Crown without the authority of\r\nparliament.(1803) Subject to this and other conditions the Bill passed the\r\nCommons, and on the 24th April was agreed to by the Lords.(1804)\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Commission, issued under the Great Seal for the\r\nestablishment of the new bank, stood the name of the lord mayor, Sir\r\nWilliam Ashurst; and out of the twenty-four original directors at least\r\nfour rose to be chief magistrate of the city, whilst others are known to\r\nhave taken an active part in the affairs of the municipality.(1805) In the\r\ncity the undertaking met with a success beyond all expectation. The very\r\nfirst day (21 June) that the subscription lists were opened at Mercers’\r\nHall nearly £300,000 was received, and within a week that amount was\r\ndoubled. Sir John Houblon, who succeeded to the mayoralty the following\r\nyear, and became the first Governor of the Bank, subscribed £10,000, the\r\nlargest amount any one individual was allowed by the terms of the charter\r\nto subscribe before the first day of July. The same amount was subscribed\r\nby the lords of the treasury on behalf of the queen. By mid-day of the 2nd\r\nJuly the whole of the money (£1,200,000) had been subscribed and the books\r\nclosed.(1806) The Great Seal was put to the bank charter, and business was\r\ncommenced in the hall of the Grocers’ Company.\r\n\r\nHitherto, as we have seen, the city of London had always acted (as indeed\r\nit claimed to be) as the king’s Chamber, and the occupier of the throne of\r\nEngland for the time being had never hesitated to draw upon this Chamber\r\nwhenever he was in need of money. The mode of procedure was nearly always\r\nthe same. The lords of the treasury would appear some morning before the\r\nCommon Council, and after a few words of explanation as to the necessities\r\nof the time, would ask for a loan, offering in most cases (we are bound to\r\nconfess) undeniable security. Supposing that the Council agreed to raise\r\nthe required loan, which it nearly always did, the mayor for the time\r\nbeing was usually instructed to issue his precept to the aldermen to\r\ncollect subscriptions within their several wards, whilst other precepts\r\nwere (in later times at least) sent to the master or wardens of the livery\r\ncompanies to do the same among the members of their companies. There were\r\ntimes, also, when the companies were called upon to subscribe in\r\nproportion to their assessment for supplying the city with corn in times\r\nof distress.(1807) Times were now changed. Instead of applying to the City\r\nfor an advance in case of need, the king thenceforth drew what he required\r\nfrom the Bank of England. During the remainder of his reign William only\r\napplied twice to the City for a loan: once, towards the close of 1696,\r\nwhen he required money for the army and navy, and again in 1697, when it\r\nwas necessary to pay off his continental allies and lay up the navy after\r\nthe peace of Ryswick (10 Sept.).(1808) The City, in its corporate\r\ncapacity, was no longer to be the purse of the nation.\r\n\r\n(M907)\r\n\r\nIn December of this year (1694)—soon after his return from an unsuccessful\r\ncampaign—William suffered an irreparable loss by the death of the queen.\r\nThe old adage touching an ill wind received a curious exemplification at\r\nQueen Mary’s death, for although that event sent down the stock of the\r\nBank of England three per cent., it benefited the East India Company by\r\ncausing a rapid rise in the price of muslin, a commodity of which we are\r\ntold that company happened to possess a large quantity.(1809) The Court of\r\nAldermen put themselves into mourning,(1810) whilst the Common Council\r\nvoted an address of condolence to the king and ordered statues\r\n(\"effigies\") of both king and queen to be erected at the Royal\r\nExchange.(1811) The king followed the advice given to him by the city\r\nfathers not to suffer too much \"resentment\" over his recent loss, and\r\ndiverted himself by practising shooting on horseback in Richmond Park\r\nwhilst his dead wife was still above ground.(1812)\r\n\r\n(M908)\r\n\r\nThe funeral did not take place until the 6th March (1695). In anticipation\r\nof that event the Court of Aldermen had some time since (18 Jan.)\r\nappointed a committee to consider of the right and title of the lord\r\nmayor, aldermen and sheriffs of the city to their mourning and their\r\nplaces in the funeral procession, as also of the mourning due to the\r\nseveral officers of the city. Four days later (22 Jan.) the committee\r\nreported(1813) to the effect that they had found from the records of the\r\ncity that it had been the custom for the lord mayor, aldermen, recorder,\r\nsheriffs and the principal and other officers of the city to have mourning\r\nallowed them by the Crown at the public interments of kings and queens,\r\nbut as to the places and precedency of the lord mayor and aldermen on\r\nthose occasions the committee had only found one instance of a funeral\r\nprocession, and that was at the funeral of Henry VII, when it appeared\r\nthat the aldermen walked \"next after the knights and before the great\r\nchaplains of dignitys and the knights of the garter being noe lords.\" The\r\nlord mayor (the report went on to say) was not named in the procession,\r\nbut at the mass and offering at the interment it appeared that the lord\r\nmayor, with his mace in hand, offered next after the lord chamberlain, and\r\nthe aldermen who had been mayors offered next to the knights of the garter\r\nand before the knights of the body, after whom came those aldermen who had\r\nnot been lord mayor.(1814) The committee concluded their report by\r\nrecommending that a deputation should wait upon the Privy Council and\r\nassert the right of the Court of Aldermen to mourning. The representation\r\nthereupon made had the desired effect and the usual mourning was allowed\r\nby warrant (29 Jan.).(1815) The citizens marked their respect for the late\r\nqueen by shutting up their shops on the day of the funeral.(1816)\r\n\r\n(M909)\r\n\r\nThe session of 1695 of William’s first parliament was signalised by the\r\ndiscovery of a system of wholesale corruption. That every man had his\r\nprice was scarcely less true in William’s day than it was in the later age\r\nof Sir Robert Walpole. The discovery of one delinquent guilty of receiving\r\nmoney for services, real or supposed, quickly led to another, until\r\nsuspicion turned upon the City of London itself. A rumour rapidly gained\r\nground to the effect that the funds of the City as well as those of the\r\nEast India Company had been largely employed in winning the favour of men\r\nin power, and the name of Sir John Trevor, the Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons, was mentioned among others.\r\n\r\n(M910)\r\n\r\nOn the 7th March the House appointed a committee to investigate the\r\nmatter, with power to send for persons and papers.(1817) On the 12th the\r\ncommittee reported to the House that they had discovered an order of a\r\ncommittee appointed by the Corporation for the purpose of seeing the\r\nOrphans’ Bill through parliament, dated the 12th February, 1694,\r\nauthorising the payment of 1,000 guineas to the Speaker, Sir John Trevor,\r\nas soon as the Bill should pass. This order, they said, was signed by\r\nevery member of the committee except Sir James Houblon and Mr. Deputy\r\nAyres, and was endorsed to the effect that the money had been delivered\r\nand paid to the Hon. Sir John Trevor on the 22nd June, 1694, in the\r\npresence of Sir Robert Clayton and Sir James Houblon, brother of Sir\r\nJohn.(1818) When summoned to account for his having refused to sign the\r\norder of the committee whilst allowing himself to witness the actual\r\npayment of the money to the Speaker, Sir James excused himself by saying\r\nthat he had accompanied Sir Robert Clayton, at the latter’s request,\r\nprofessedly for the purpose of thanking the Speaker for his pains about\r\nthe Orphans’ Bill; that this being done, the Chamberlain, who had gone\r\nwith them, pulled out a note or bill which he handed to the Speaker, but\r\nas to the nature of the note or bill Houblon declared himself to have been\r\nignorant until subsequently informed by the Chamberlain. Other members of\r\nthe Corporation Committee also gave evidence as to the warrant for payment\r\nof the money having been originally made out with a blank space left for\r\nthe name of the payee. The report further declared that sums of money had\r\nbeen paid to Paul Godrell, clerk of the House of Commons, to the city\r\nsolicitor, the solicitor-general and the chairman of the Corporation\r\nCommittee in respect of the Orphans’ Bill, whilst the orphans themselves\r\nhad been prevailed upon to give security for the payment of five per cent.\r\non their whole property to certain other parties who professed to be able\r\nto render valuable services in the event of the Bill being passed.(1819)\r\n\r\n(M911)\r\n\r\nBy the time that the reading of the committee’s report to the House was\r\nfinished it was growing dusk, and candles were called for. A resolution\r\nwas then moved and put to the house by Trevor himself, that the Speaker,\r\nby receiving a gratuity of 1,000 guineas from the city of London after\r\npassing of the Orphans’ Bill, had been guilty of a high crime and\r\nmisdemeanour. The resolution was passed, and four days later (16 March)\r\nTrevor was expelled the House.(1820)\r\n\r\n(M912)\r\n\r\nA month later (18 April) the House of Lords were busy investigating the\r\nconduct of the Marquis of Normanby in accepting, and of the Corporation of\r\nthe City in granting, a lease of a certain plot of land lying behind\r\nClarendon House, part of the City’s estate known as Conduit Mead. It was\r\nshown by oral and documentary evidence that a longer lease than usual had\r\nrecently been granted (Jan., 1695) to the marquis as \"a gratification,\" he\r\nbeing a person of distinction who had shown himself very friendly to the\r\ninterests of the City and likely to continue so.(1821) Negotiations for a\r\nlease had been commenced so far back as January, 1694, \"before the\r\nOrphans’ Bill was on the anvill in the House of Commons.\"(1822) It was not\r\ndenied that the City entertained the hope that the marquis would use his\r\ninterest in expediting the passage of the Bill, and that this hope had\r\nbeen realised. On the other hand it was shown that when the marquis learnt\r\nthat one of the conditions of the lease was that he should \"covenant\" to\r\nprocure an Act of Parliament for settling some doubts of title to the land\r\nconveyed, he at once declared that such a thing was not in his power, but\r\nlay with the king, the lords and the commons; nevertheless, he consented\r\nto use his best endeavours in that direction. The marquis, it was said,\r\nhad also been indiscreet enough to divulge certain proceedings of the\r\nHouse of Lords in the matter of the Convex Lights, and this formed the\r\nsubject of an investigation by the House at the same time as the granting\r\nof this lease. After careful consideration the House entirely acquitted\r\nhis lordship of blame in both cases.(1823)\r\n\r\n(M913)\r\n\r\nIn considering the City’s action in respect of the Orphans’ Bill we must\r\nnot forget to take into account the condition of the age. It was one in\r\nwhich peculation and venality were predominant. Nearly every official who\r\nwas worth the buying could be bought, and the world thought none the worse\r\nof him provided that these pecuniary transactions were kept decently\r\nveiled. The \"gifts and rewards\" bestowed by the City with the object of\r\nexpediting the passage of the Orphans’ Bill were as nothing compared with\r\nthe vast sums which the East India Company was reported to have disbursed\r\nin order to obtain the confirmation of its charter. It was the practice\r\nwhen Sir Thomas Cook was in power for the directors of the company to sign\r\nwarrants for any sum that he might require without demanding particulars\r\nfrom him. In seven years (1688-1694) more than £100,000 had been disposed\r\nof for the company’s \"special service,\" nearly £90,000 of which had been\r\ndisbursed whilst Cook was governor (1692-1693).(1824)\r\n\r\n(M914)\r\n\r\nA parliamentary committee endeavoured to obtain some account as to how\r\nthis large sum of money had been expended, but could learn nothing more\r\nthan that it had been spent on the \"special service\" of the company and\r\nthat a great part of it had been entrusted to Sir Basil Firebrace.(1825)\r\nFirebrace denied this, but confessed to having received upwards of £16,000\r\nfor which he had accounted to the company. The committee’s report\r\nproceeded to inform the House that the company had spent considerable sums\r\nof money, under the guise of contracts, in buying up the interests of\r\n\"interlopers\" and getting them to join the company. They had found Sir\r\nSamuel Dashwood, Sir John Fleet, Sir Thomas Cook (all aldermen of the\r\ncity), Sir Joseph Herne and John Perry to have been cognisant of these\r\nproceedings, but they being members of parliament the committee did not\r\nthink fit to send for or examine them.(1826) Acting upon the committee’s\r\nreport, the House called upon Sir Thomas Cook (26 March) to give an\r\naccount of the sum of £87,000 which he had received of the company’s\r\nmoney, and upon his refusing committed him to the Tower.(1827) A Bill was\r\nwithin a few days introduced into the House for compelling Cook to make\r\ndisclosure and rapidly passed (6 April).(1828) In the Upper House the Bill\r\nmet with the strongest denunciation by the Duke of Leeds (who saw in it\r\nconsiderable danger to himself), as also by Cook himself, who was brought\r\nfrom the Tower for the purpose of allowing him to plead against the\r\npassing of such a Bill. At the Bar of the House the latter earnestly\r\nimplored the Peers not to pass the Bill in its present form. Let them pass\r\na Bill of Indemnity and he would tell them all. The Lords considered his\r\nrequest reasonable, and after a conference with the Lower House it was\r\nagreed that the Bill should take the form of an Indemnity Bill, and so it\r\nwas passed (19 April), a joint committee of both Houses being appointed to\r\nexamine Cook and others.(1829)\r\n\r\n(M915)\r\n\r\nHis examination, which took place in the Exchequer Chamber on the 23rd\r\nApril, confirmed the committee’s previous suspicions.(1830) The sum of\r\n£10,000 had been paid (he said) to Sir Basil Firebrace about November,\r\n1693, when the charter of the East India Company had been confirmed, and\r\nhe had always been under the apprehension that Firebrace had pocketed the\r\nmoney \"to recompense his losses in the interloping trade.\" A further sum\r\nof £30,000 had been paid to Firebrace on various contracts. There had been\r\na contract involving the payment of £60,000 on account of procuring a new\r\ncharter, and another of the value of £40,000 on account of getting the\r\ncharter sanctioned by an Act of Parliament, but as no Act was passed this\r\nlatter contract fell through. There was a further sum of £30,000 which had\r\nbeen lost to the company on account of certain stock it had agreed to\r\npurchase from Firebrace at the price of £150 per cent. at a time when the\r\ncompany’s stock was standing at par. Firebrace had always refused to give\r\nhim any account as to how this money was disposed of, and had declared\r\nthat \"if he were further pressed he would have no more to do in it.\" Such\r\nwas the sum and substance of Cook’s confession so far as it affected\r\nFirebrace.\r\n\r\n(M916)\r\n\r\nThe next day (24 April) Firebrace appeared before the committee. As to the\r\n£10,000 he had received from Cook, that was (he said) a gratuity which had\r\nbeen given to him before the granting of the charter. The other sum of\r\n£30,000 was due on a contract \"for favours and services done.\" He was\r\npositive that both sums were intended \"directly for himself and for the\r\nuse of no other person whatsoever\"; that he paid nothing thereout towards\r\nprocuring either charter or Act, nor had promised to do so. He\r\nacknowledged himself to have been very active in his endeavours to gain\r\nover interlopers, and to improve the stock of the company, but when\r\npressed by the committee for particulars he asked to be excused giving an\r\nimmediate answer on the score of ill-health; he had not slept for two\r\nnights and was much indisposed.(1831) On the 25th and following day he was\r\nwell enough to volunteer further evidence incriminating the Duke of Leeds.\r\nHe told the committee of an interview he (Firebrace) had had with Sir\r\nThomas Cook, when the latter expressed his apprehension lest the passing\r\nthe East India Company’s charter should be opposed by the lord president.\r\nThey had then agreed to endeavour to win his lordship’s favour by an offer\r\nof 5,000 guineas. That sum had been actually left at the duke’s house, and\r\nit was only returned on the morning the enquiry opened. After the payment\r\nof the money both Cook and himself had enjoyed free access to the duke and\r\nfound him willing to give them his assistance.(1832)\r\n\r\n(M917)\r\n\r\nAmong others who gave evidence was Child himself, who acknowledged that he\r\nhad suggested an offer of £50,000 to the king in order to induce his\r\nmajesty to waive his prerogative and allow the company to be settled by\r\nAct of Parliament. William, however, was impervious to a bribe and\r\ndeclined to meddle in the matter.\r\n\r\n(M918)\r\n\r\nThe result of the enquiry was that the Duke of Leeds was ordered to be\r\nimpeached, whilst Firebrace and Cook were committed to the Tower.(1833)\r\nThey recovered their liberty in April, 1696, and in July, 1698, Firebrace\r\nwas created a baronet.(1834)\r\n\r\n(M919)\r\n\r\nIn July, 1702, the rival companies were content to sink their differences,\r\nand a union was effected.(1835) Shortly before this took place the Old\r\nCompany voted the sum of £12,000 as a free gift to Cook for his past\r\nservices.(1836) Firebrace, who had used his best endeavours to bring about\r\nthe union, brought an action against the Old Company for compensation for\r\nhis services, but consented to drop all proceedings on receiving stock in\r\nthe company to the amount of £10,000.(1837) In 1704 Cook was elected\r\nmayor, but the state of his health not allowing him to serve, he was\r\ndischarged. He died in September, 1709.(1838)\r\n\r\n(M920)\r\n\r\nOn Sunday the 12th May, 1695, William again set out for the continent, and\r\ndid not return until the 10th October. The great feature of the campaign\r\nwas the brilliant siege and recovery of the town of Namur, which had been\r\nlost to the allied forces three years before. Baulked in a proposed design\r\nagainst the king’s person by his unexpected departure, the Jacobites had\r\nto content themselves with other measures. On the 10th June, the birthday\r\nof the unfortunate Prince of Wales, a number of them met at a tavern in\r\nDrury Lane. Excited by wine they sallied forth, with drums beating and\r\ncolours flying, and insisted on passers by drinking the prince’s health.\r\nThis roused the indignation of the neighbours, who sacked the tavern and\r\nput the revellers to flight, one of the ringleaders being seized and\r\nafterwards committed to Newgate.(1839) When, in the following August, the\r\nwhole of London was on the tiptoe of excitement, waiting for news of the\r\nfall of Namur, the citizens were suddenly amazed at the sight of a\r\nhorseman in military uniform riding through the main streets and\r\nannouncing that William had been killed. That the wish was father to the\r\nthought became sufficiently clear to the by-standers when they heard the\r\nman declare with pistol in hand and sword drawn that he would kill anyone\r\nwho denied the truth of his statement. A serious disturbance was avoided\r\nby his being incontinently dragged from his horse and carried before the\r\nlord mayor, who committed him to prison.(1840)\r\n\r\n(M921)\r\n\r\nWhen the king returned in October, with the laurels of victory fresh on\r\nhis brow, he determined to seize the favourable opportunity for dissolving\r\nparliament. The result of the elections for a new parliament—the first\r\ntriennial parliament under a recent Act—justified the course he had taken.\r\nThe citizens, who had been among the first to welcome him on his arrival\r\nin London, and whose sheriffs—Edward Wills and Owen Buckingham—he had\r\nrecently knighted,(1841) instead of returning Tory members, as in the late\r\nparliament, returned four Whigs, viz., three aldermen, Sir Robert Clayton,\r\nSir John Fleet and Sir William Ashurst, and one commoner, Thomas Papillon.\r\nThe election was strongly contested, a poll being demanded by three other\r\ncandidates, viz., Sir William Pritchard, Sir Thomas Vernon and Sir William\r\nRussell, against the return of Clayton, Ashurst and Papillon. The result\r\nof the poll, however, left matters undisturbed.(1842) The contest in\r\nWestminster was more severe than in the city, but, like the latter, ended\r\nin a victory for the Whigs. Cook, who was still a prisoner in the Tower,\r\nagain contested Colchester, but lost his seat.(1843) On the 22nd November\r\nthe Houses met.\r\n\r\n(M922)\r\n\r\nThe king’s return was a signal for fresh action on the part of the\r\nJacobites. It was resolved to assassinate William on his return from\r\nhunting in Richmond Park. The management of the conspiracy was entrusted\r\nto Sir George Barclay, a Scotch refugee, who succeeded in getting together\r\na small band of men willing to take part in the desperate enterprise. The\r\nplot was, however, discovered, and some of the leading conspirators\r\narrested. On the evening of Sunday the 23rd February (1696) the lord mayor\r\n(Sir John Houblon) was summoned to the Privy Council and informed of the\r\nnarrow escape of the king. He was charged to look well to the safety of\r\nthe city. On Monday morning all the city trained bands were under arms,\r\nand on Tuesday the Common Council voted a congratulatory address to the\r\nking upon his escape.(1844)\r\n\r\n(M923)\r\n\r\nBy that time parliament had been informed of what had taken place. The\r\nCommons immediately suspended the Habeas Corpus Act and agreed to enter\r\ninto an association for the defence of their king and country. An\r\ninstrument was forthwith drawn up whereby each individual member of the\r\nHouse pledged himself to uphold King William and William’s government\r\nagainst James and his adherents, and in case his majesty should meet with\r\na violent death to unite with one another in inflicting condign vengeance\r\non his murderers, and in supporting the order of succession to the crown\r\nas settled by the Bill of Rights. On Tuesday (25 Feb.) the House was\r\ncalled over; the association engrossed on parchment lay on the table, and\r\nevery member present went up and signed, those who from sickness or other\r\ncause were absent being ordered to sign the document on their first\r\nappearance in the House, or publicly declare from their seat in the House\r\ntheir refusal to do so.(1845) The next day the Common Council of the city\r\nunanimously resolved to enter into the like association, the livery\r\ncompanies of the city being afterwards called upon by the mayor to do the\r\nsame.(1846)\r\n\r\n(M924)\r\n\r\nFor weeks and months strict search was made in the city for Papists and\r\nsuspect persons,(1847) and among them for Sir John Fenwick, for whose\r\narrest a proclamation was issued on the 22nd March.(1848) He was\r\neventually captured whilst making his way to the coast for the purpose of\r\nescaping to France, and was committed to Newgate. When a motion was made\r\nin November for proceeding against him by Bill of Attainder the sheriffs\r\nof London surrendered their charge to the sergeant-at-arms of the House of\r\nCommons. After his execution on Tower Hill in January of the following\r\nyear (1697) some officers of Sheriff Blewet, whose duty it had been to\r\nkeep watch over Fenwick by night and day whilst lying in Newgate, had to\r\napply to the Court of Aldermen before they could get the sheriff to pay\r\nthem the money (£9 10_s._) due to them for that service.(1849)\r\n\r\n(M925)\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the assassination plot had the result of rendering\r\nWilliam’s seat on the throne more secure than ever, and won for him the\r\nunqualified support of parliament. Early in February (1696) a Bill had\r\nbeen brought in to exclude from the House every person who did not possess\r\na certain estate in land. The Bill met with much opposition in commercial\r\ncircles, and more especially in the city of London,(1850) and the king\r\nbeing unwilling to estrange those merchants and traders who had so often\r\nassisted him, exercised his prerogative and declined to give his assent to\r\nthe Bill. Thereupon some violent Tories moved that whoever advised the\r\nking to take this course was an enemy to him and the nation; but the House\r\ndisplayed its loyalty by rejecting the motion by an overwhelming majority\r\nand ordering the division list to be published.(1851)\r\n\r\n(M926)\r\n\r\nThe City was not behindhand in renewing its assurances of loyalty. The\r\nliverymen of the several companies assembled in the Guildhall for the\r\nelection of a mayor on Michaelmas-day passed a resolution to stand by the\r\nking with their lives and fortunes, and desired the city members of\r\nparliament to see that a searching enquiry were made into the late\r\nconspiracy as the best means of preserving the king’s person, establishing\r\nthe government, and reviving trade and credit.(1852)\r\n\r\n(M927)\r\n\r\nAt the time when this resolution was passed the king was expected home\r\nfrom the continent, whither he had gone in May last. During his absence\r\nthere had occurred a monetary crisis—the first since the establishment of\r\nthe Bank of England—which, after causing for several months a great amount\r\nof distress, was destined to be succeeded by a long period of unbroken\r\nprosperity. An Act had recently been passed for calling in all clipt money\r\nand substituting milled money in its stead,(1853) and the crisis was\r\nbrought about by the old money being called in before the new money was\r\nready for issue. Saturday, the 2nd May, was practically the last day clipt\r\nmoney was received by the exchequer. Three days later the stock of milled\r\nmoney in the coffers of the Bank of England at Grocers’ Hall had run out,\r\nand the governor of the Bank, Sir John Houblon, who happened at the time\r\nto be also lord mayor, had to propitiate the numerous claimants for the\r\nnew money by offering them part payment in the old coin and the rest in\r\nthe new as soon as it was minted.(1854)\r\n\r\n(M928)\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July matters became worse. In spite of the\r\nextraordinary activity displayed by the Mint authorities, at the Tower and\r\nin divers parts of the country, the supply had not equalled the demand,\r\nyet a large sum of money was now imperatively demanded for payment of the\r\narmy on the continent. The king himself had written to say that unless the\r\nmoney was forthcoming his troops were ready to mutiny or desert. Nothing\r\nless than a million would satisfy the requirements of the army in\r\nFlanders, a like sum was wanted for the navy, whilst half that amount was\r\nnecessary for the army in England.(1855) How was this enormous sum to be\r\nraised? It was thought that the City might vote something towards it, but\r\nthe Chamberlain declared that any proposal for a loan at that time would\r\nwith difficulty be carried into execution owing to the scarcity of\r\nmoney.(1856) Some private individuals, however, managed to raise £200,000\r\nfor the king, whilst others, like Sir Josiah Child, Charles Duncombe and\r\nSir Joseph Herne, were prepared to stand security for £300,000 more, which\r\nthe Dutch were ready to advance. After long deliberation the Bank of\r\nEngland agreed (15 Aug.) to advance another £200,000.(1857) These sums\r\nsufficed for the more immediate wants of the king, and allowed time for\r\nthe issue of the new currency.\r\n\r\n(M929)\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1696 had been carried on in a very desultory way. All\r\nparties were anxious for a peace. Towards the end of April, 1697, William\r\nonce more crossed over to Flanders,(1858) and the French king having for\r\nthe first time shown a disposition to come to terms, it was arranged that\r\na congress should meet near the Hague. The result of the congress was the\r\nconclusion (10 Sept.) of the Peace of Ryswick, whereby Louis consented to\r\nacknowledge William’s title to the throne. The news was received in the\r\ncity four days later with every demonstration of joy; the Tower guns were\r\ndischarged, flags hung out, bells set ringing and bonfires lighted.(1859)\r\n\r\n(M930)\r\n\r\nThe Court of Aldermen resolved to give the king a more than ordinary\r\nreception on his return. Search was made for precedents as to the manner\r\nin which former kings had been received on their return from progresses or\r\nfrom parts beyond the sea, and these precedents, from the time of Edward\r\nIV down to that of King Charles II, were duly reported to the court by a\r\ncommittee appointed to make the search.(1860) The committee was next\r\ninstructed to consider of suitable ways and methods for the reception of\r\nhis majesty if he should be pleased to pass through the city, and on this\r\nalso the committee reported with elaborate detail.(1861) These and other\r\npreparations were all made under the apprehension that the king was about\r\nto return immediately. Weeks went by and no king appeared. The Court of\r\nAldermen availed themselves of the delay to put the finishing touches to\r\nthe programme of welcome that was to be accorded him, and to commit into\r\ncustody any suspicious character they found.(1862) At length, after long\r\nand impatient expectation, news came that the king had landed at Margate\r\non the 14th November.(1863) By the following night his majesty reached\r\nGreenwich and rested in the handsome building which, at the desire of his\r\nbeloved queen, had been recently converted from a palace into a hospital\r\nfor disabled seamen.(1864)\r\n\r\n(M931)\r\n\r\nThe lord mayor immediately issued his precept to the several livery\r\ncompanies (they had received a previous warning to prepare for the\r\noccasion on the 1st October)(1865) to be ready in their stands by eight\r\no’clock on the morning of Tuesday the 16th November, well apparelled and\r\nwith all the ornaments of their companies before them.(1866) That morning\r\nwitnessed one of the finest sights that had ever been seen in the city of\r\nLondon, famous as it always had been for its pageantry. No expense had\r\nbeen spared in providing new gowns for the magistrates and new banners for\r\nthe companies. The mayor, aldermen and sheriffs rode out \"in their\r\nformalities\" as far as Southwark, where they met the king, and where the\r\nusual ceremony took place of surrendering the civic sword into his\r\nmajesty’s hands, to be immediately returned to the lord mayor. This done,\r\nthe procession was formed, and the king was escorted with trumpets and\r\nkettle-drums through the entire length of the city, the streets being\r\nguarded by the six regiments of trained bands, and the houses rendered\r\nbright with hangings of tapestry.(1867)\r\n\r\n(M932)\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, accompanied by the\r\nrecorder, waited upon his majesty and congratulated him on the peace and\r\non his safe return. The king in reply thanked them, and conferred the\r\nhonour of knighthood upon the sheriffs, Bartholomew Gracedieu and James\r\nCollett.(1868)\r\n\r\n(M933)\r\n\r\nThe rejoicings terminated with a thanksgiving service at St. Paul’s (2\r\nDec.), the work of Sir Christopher Wren being sufficiently advanced to\r\nadmit of divine service being held there. The mayor and aldermen attended\r\nin state. The king did not attend lest his presence should draw off\r\ncongregations from other churches; but he attended service in his private\r\nchapel at Whitehall. Not only in London but throughout the kingdom the day\r\nwas solemnly observed, whilst the night was given up to festivity and\r\nfireworks.(1869)\r\n\r\n(M934)\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1698, the first triennial parliament had run its course and a new\r\nelection of members for the city took place all the old members retained\r\ntheir seats except Sir Robert Clayton. His place was taken by Sir James\r\nHoublon, a Tory. On this occasion the election for the city did not take\r\nplace until the returns of many constituencies in the country had been\r\nmade known. As a rule the returns of the metropolitan constituencies were\r\nlooked forward to as an augury of the political complexion of the coming\r\nparliament. This parliament was not allowed to live its full time, but was\r\ndissolved in December, 1700, a new parliament being summoned to meet in\r\nthe following February (1701).(1870) Sir Robert Clayton regained his seat,\r\nand with him were returned Sir William Ashurst (who headed the poll),\r\nGilbert Heathcote and Sir William Withers.(1871) Upon Heathcote being\r\ndeclared by parliament disqualified to sit owing to a technical breach of\r\ntrust his seat was taken by Sir John Fleet.(1872)\r\n\r\n(M935) (M936)\r\n\r\nAfter the death of James II at St. Germains (5 Sept., 1701) Louis broke\r\nhis vow (made at Ryswick) not to do anything to disturb or subvert the\r\ngovernment of England, and forthwith proclaimed the late king’s son to be\r\nheir to his father’s throne. The whole English nation was stirred against\r\nthe French king for having dared to acknowledge as their sovereign the boy\r\nwho had been held to be supposititious and whose title to the crown had\r\nbeen rejected by parliament. The citizens of London were among the first\r\nto express their loyalty to William and their readiness to do their utmost\r\nto preserve his person and government against all invasion. The king was\r\non the continent at the time, but an address to this effect, unanimously\r\nagreed to by the Common Council (26 Sept.), was forwarded to him by the\r\nlords justices, who held the reins of government during his absence, and\r\nwho in due course were instructed to inform the City of the great\r\nsatisfaction its address had afforded his majesty. The example thus set\r\nwas quickly followed by others, and similar addresses began to flow in\r\nfrom all parts of the kingdom,(1873) whilst the City’s address was by the\r\nking’s orders translated into foreign languages for transmission to the\r\nseveral courts of Europe.(1874)\r\n\r\n(M937)\r\n\r\nA few hours before the City’s address reached the hands of the lords\r\njustices the citizens had assembled (29 Sept.) in Common Hall to choose a\r\nmayor for the ensuing year. Sir Charles Duncombe, who had amassed a large\r\nfortune as a goldsmith and banker, and who, although returned by the\r\nlivery at the head of the poll the previous year, had been set aside by\r\nthe Court of Aldermen in his contest for the mayoralty probably on account\r\nof his Tory principles,(1875) was again put up as a candidate, although in\r\npoint of seniority he was one of the youngest aldermen. This time he\r\nfailed to get a majority of votes at the Common Hall, but his popularity\r\nwas still sufficiently strong to return him second on the poll, and his\r\nname was submitted in conjunction with that of William Gore to the Court\r\nof Aldermen for them to select one. It was quite within their province to\r\nselect if they chose the second name submitted to them—they had frequently\r\ndone so before—but in the face of Louis’s recent act of insolence they\r\npreferred to call to the mayoralty chair a man whose Tory principles were\r\nnot too pronounced rather than one who had accepted an alderman’s\r\ncommission from James II, and Sir William Gore was accordingly declared\r\nelected.(1876)\r\n\r\n(M938)\r\n\r\nThe parliament which assembled in February, 1701, enjoyed a still shorter\r\nexistence than its predecessor, for it was dissolved in the following\r\nNovember. Another was summoned to meet in December.(1877) Great excitement\r\nprevailed in the city over this election. The Whigs met at the Crown\r\nTavern behind the Exchange and agreed to put up three of the old members,\r\nviz., Clayton, Ashurst and Heathcote, and to run a fresh candidate in the\r\nperson of Sir Thomas Abney. The Tory or \"Church party\" opposed these\r\ncandidates with four others, viz., Sir William Gore, the lord mayor, Sir\r\nJohn Fleet, Sir Richard Levett and Sir Charles Duncombe, the recently\r\ndefeated candidate for the mayoralty. When it came to polling all four\r\nWhigs were returned by an overwhelming majority.(1878) This was the last\r\nparliament of William’s reign. On the 20th February (1702) he was thrown\r\nfrom his horse whilst riding in Richmond Park and broke his collar-bone.\r\nHis health had previously shown signs of giving way. On the 8th March he\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(M939)\r\n\r\nOn the day that William died the Lords Spiritual and Temporal met together\r\nand, \"with the assistance\" of the Privy Council, a number of other\r\n\"principall gentlemen of quality\" and the lord mayor, aldermen and\r\ncitizens of London, proceeded to draw up a document proclaiming the\r\nPrincess Anne successor to the crown. The day happened to be Sunday;\r\nnevertheless on that same afternoon public proclamation of the queen’s\r\naccession was made at Temple Bar and the Royal Exchange in the presence of\r\nthe mayor and Court of Aldermen, whilst the sheriffs were despatched to\r\nlearn when her majesty would be pleased to receive the aldermen.(1879)\r\n\r\n(M940) (M941)\r\n\r\nTwo days later (10 March) the Common Council voted an address condoling\r\nwith the queen on the death of the late king and congratulating her upon\r\nher accession.(1880) The Court of Aldermen resolved to put themselves into\r\n\"close\" mourning, each alderman providing himself with a mourning gown at\r\nhis own expense, whilst the Chamberlain was instructed to provide similar\r\ngowns for the chief officers of the Corporation at the City’s expense, as\r\nhad formerly been done on the demise of Charles II.(1881) They further\r\nresolved, with her majesty’s permission, to cause her portrait to be\r\npainted and to be set up in the Guildhall and a statue of her to be set up\r\nat the Royal Exchange. It was found on enquiry that the statues of kings\r\nand queens already in the Royal Exchange had been set up at the expense of\r\nthe companies, except those of William and Mary, which (as we have seen)\r\nwere erected by order of the Common Council. On the other hand, the\r\npictures of Charles II, James II and of William and Mary had all been paid\r\nfor by the Chamber. Artists were invited to send in sketches or designs\r\nfor her majesty’s picture; and this having been done, the work was\r\nentrusted to Closterman.(1882)\r\n\r\n(M942)\r\n\r\nAt the coronation, which took place on the 23rd April, the mayor, aldermen\r\nand twelve representatives of the principal livery companies were present,\r\ncare having been taken by the City Remembrancer that their proper places\r\nwere assigned them both in the Abbey and at the subsequent banquet in\r\nWestminster Hall. The civic dignitaries started from the city as early as\r\nseven o’clock in the morning in order to be at Westminster Hall by eight\r\na.m. The mayor was provided at the City’s expense with the customary gown\r\nof crimson velvet for the occasion, the sword-bearer being only a little\r\nless resplendent in a gown of damask.(1883)\r\n\r\n(M943)\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution it had been the custom for parliament to cease to\r\nexist immediately on the demise of the crown. It was held that inasmuch as\r\nthe king was the head of the parliament, and as the members of a living\r\nbody could not continue to exist without a head, so a parliament could not\r\ncontinue without a king, but must with the death of the king, _ipso\r\nfacto_, itself expire. The inconveniences arising from this had at length\r\nbecome so apparent that an Act had recently been passed permitting a\r\nparliament in existence at the demise of the crown to be continued for a\r\nperiod of six months after such demise.(1884) By virtue of this Act the\r\nparliament, which had met for the first time on the 30th December, 1701,\r\nwas allowed to sit, notwithstanding the king’s death, until dissolved in\r\nJuly, 1702.\r\n\r\n(M944)\r\n\r\nThe \"good\" Queen Anne, warmly attached as she was to the Church of\r\nEngland, was naturally inclined towards the Tories in preference to the\r\nWhigs, and lost no time in dismissing Somers, Halifax and other Whig\r\nministers of the late king and filling their places with Tories. Her\r\naction in this respect influenced the coming elections more especially in\r\nthe city of London, where a new commission of lieutenancy appointed by the\r\nqueen had already turned out six colonels of Whiggish proclivities and had\r\nput in their place others of a different political character.(1885)\r\n\r\n(M945)\r\n\r\nOnly one of the old Whig members managed to retain his seat, viz., Gilbert\r\nHeathcote, who had recently been elected alderman of Walbrook ward in the\r\nplace of Sir John Moore, deceased, and who may have inherited some of the\r\nTory principles of his predecessor together with the aldermanic gown.\r\nThere is nothing like office for chastening a man’s political opinions.\r\nHowever this may have been, his three colleagues elected to serve with him\r\nin the coming parliament were also aldermen of the city and staunch\r\nTories. These were Sir William Pritchard, Sir John Fleet and Sir Francis\r\nChild. A scrutiny had been demanded by Clayton, Ashurst and Abney, the\r\ndefeated candidates, but it failed to disturb the result of the\r\npoll.(1886) Clayton was successful in finding a seat for Bletchingley, co.\r\nSurrey.(1887)\r\n\r\n(M946)\r\n\r\nWhen Michaelmas-day came round and Sir Samuel Dashwood—a tried Tory who\r\nhad sat for the city in the only parliament convened under James II, as\r\nwell as in the first parliament under William and Mary—was elected to the\r\nmayoralty chair, the choice of the citizens was highly commended by the\r\nlord keeper,(1888) and the queen accepted an invitation to dinner on lord\r\nmayor’s day. It was proposed to invite both Houses of Parliament to the\r\ncity on that occasion, but it was found that the accommodation at the\r\nGuildhall was insufficient for the purpose.(1889) The cost of the\r\nentertainment to her majesty was not thrown on the Chamber, but was\r\ndischarged by the aldermen, each of them agreeing to subscribe the sum of\r\n£25 for the purpose. The entertainment, however, was given on so lavish a\r\nscale that these contributions had to be doubled, in addition to which the\r\noutgoing as well as the incoming mayor contributed £300 respectively and\r\neach of the sheriffs £150. The whole cost of the entertainment amounted to\r\n£2,000.(1890) The queen acknowledged the hospitality thus offered by\r\nconferring the honour of knighthood upon Francis Dashwood, brother of the\r\nlord mayor, Richard Hoare, the goldsmith of Fleet Street, Gilbert\r\nHeathcote, the city member, and upon \"Mr. Eaton,\" the linendraper, of\r\nCheapside, from whose house she had witnessed the pageant.(1891)\r\n\r\n(M947)\r\n\r\nScarce a fortnight elapsed before the queen again visited the city (12\r\nNov.), the occasion being a public thanksgiving service in St. Paul’s for\r\nthe successes of Marlborough, Ormond and Rooke. In July Marlborough had\r\nopened the campaign against France and Spain, war having been declared\r\nagainst those countries on the 4th May,(1892) and although he had been\r\nunable to bring the enemy to a general engagement he had succeeded in\r\nreducing several important towns and in cutting off the communications of\r\nthe French with the Lower Rhine. At sea the English and Dutch combined\r\nfleets under the command of Sir George Rooke, with a large number of\r\ntroops on board under the command of the Duke of Ormond, had succeeded in\r\ncapturing a rich booty in Vigo Bay.(1893) Both Houses of Parliament\r\nattended the service. The order of the procession and the distribution of\r\nseats within the cathedral are given in detail in a report laid before the\r\nCourt of Aldermen (15 Dec.).(1894) The queen, who was attired in purple,\r\nand wore her collar and George, was met at Temple Bar by the mayor,\r\naldermen and sheriffs on horseback. The city sword, having been presented\r\nto her majesty and restored to the mayor, was carried by him next before\r\nher majesty’s coach to the cathedral. The streets from St. James’ to\r\nTemple Bar were lined by the Westminster militia, and from Temple Bar to\r\nLudgate by two regiments of the city trained bands. The balconies and\r\nwindows were hung with carpets and tapestry. On arriving at St. Paul’s her\r\nmajesty was met at the door by the Peers and escorted to the choir of the\r\ncathedral by the Duke of Somerset and the lord chamberlain, the sword of\r\nstate being borne before her by the Duke of Ormond. The spectacle which\r\npresented itself inside St. Paul’s on this occasion has scarcely ever been\r\nequalled. Opposite the altar, on a throne of state, sat the queen. The\r\nPeers were accommodated with seats in the body of the choir, whilst the\r\nCommons sat in the stalls and upper galleries on either side. In the two\r\nlower galleries next the throne sat the foreign ministers and ladies \"of\r\nquality.\" There were two other galleries near the altar, one on the north\r\nside and the other on the south side of the church. The latter was\r\noccupied by the mayor, aldermen and sheriffs, whilst the former was\r\noccupied (as usual) by their ladies. The sermon was preached by the Bishop\r\nof Exeter. The night was given up to bonfires and illuminations.(1895)\r\n\r\n(M948)\r\n\r\nTwo years later the city’s minster—now rapidly approaching completion—was\r\nagain the scene of a similar gathering, the occasion being a thanksgiving\r\nservice for a signal victory gained by Marlborough over the French and\r\nBavarian forces at Blenheim, near Hochstadt in Germany (2 Aug.,\r\no.s.).(1896) The 7th September was set apart as a day of public\r\nthanksgiving.(1897) The City in the meanwhile voted (30 Aug.) an address\r\nto her majesty(1898) congratulating her on the success that had attended\r\nher arms and complimenting her on her judgment in selecting Marlborough\r\nfor the command, whose courage and conduct had \"settled the tottering\r\nempire, relieved Savoy, chastised the Elector of Bavaria, and curbed the\r\nambition of the French king.\" They prayed that her majesty might long live\r\na terror to her enemies, a defence to her injured neighbours and a delight\r\nto her subjects. The next day (31 Aug.) the mayor issued his precept to\r\nthe several livery companies to prepare their rails, stands, banners and\r\nother usual \"ornaments of triumph\" with the view of taking up such\r\nposition in the street as should be assigned to them.(1899) Several of the\r\ncompanies, viz., the Girdlers, the Scriveners and the Glovers, refused to\r\nobey the precept, and were thereupon summoned before the Court of Aldermen\r\nto answer for their conduct, whilst others like the Dyers, the Cooks and\r\nthe Poulterers were excused.(1900) A little difficulty arose touching the\r\nseats assigned by the lord chamberlain in St. Paul’s to the civic\r\ndignitaries, who claimed the right to occupy the seats and places where\r\nthey usually sat, the more so on this occasion because, parliament not\r\nbeing then in session, the members of neither House were to be in\r\nattendance. How matters were eventually arranged does not appear, but the\r\nCourt of Aldermen up to the last moment were emphatic in their resolution\r\nthat the lord mayor should insist on keeping his place in the cathedral,\r\nand a week later (14 Sept.) appointed a committee to search for precedents\r\nas to the place occupied by the mayor and aldermen in processions and\r\ntheir seats in St. Paul’s on occasions of any king or queen coming there\r\nto hear a sermon.(1901) In other respects everything passed off well.\r\n\r\n(M949)\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 14th December Marlborough arrived in London,\r\nbringing in his train Marshal Tallard and other general officers whom he\r\nhad made captive at Blenheim. On the 20th an invitation was sent for his\r\ngrace to dine with the Court of Aldermen and the sheriffs at Goldsmiths’\r\nHall, the residence of Sir Owen Buckingham, the lord mayor, on any day he\r\nmight name. The invitation having been graciously accepted for the 6th\r\nJanuary, the duke was further requested to bring with him what company he\r\npleased, for his grace would find none others there besides the lord\r\nmayor, aldermen and sheriffs to entertain him. Each alderman and sheriff\r\nwas called upon to subscribe the sum of £25 towards defraying the cost of\r\nthe entertainment.(1902)\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed the duke was conveyed to the city in one of her\r\nmajesty’s own coaches, accompanied by the Duke of Somerset, the foreign\r\nministers and a large number of the nobility and general officers of the\r\narmy. At Temple Bar he was met by the city marshal, by whom he was\r\nconducted to Goldsmiths’ Hall. There a \"noble treat\" was set out for the\r\nguests, \"the queen’s musick playing all the while, and everything\r\nperformed in great splendor.\"(1903) The Common Council acknowledged the\r\ngreat public spirit thus displayed by the Court of Aldermen and the\r\nsheriffs by passing an unanimous vote of thanks to them.(1904)\r\n\r\n(M950)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, whilst Marlborough had been so successfully carrying on\r\nthe work which the late king had set himself to do, the city of London had\r\nbeen busy setting its house in order. The poor were with them in greater\r\nnumbers than ever. The statute (13 and 14 Chas. II, c. 12) passed in 1662\r\nfor the better relief of the poor of the kingdom, authorising the erection\r\nof workhouses, necessitated the expenditure of a great deal of money, and\r\na sum amounting to nearly £5,000 had to be periodically raised for the\r\npurpose by assessment of the several parishes of the city.(1905) Besides\r\nthis there was a yearly sum of £8,000 due by the City to the orphans and\r\nits other creditors, a sum which exceeded the City’s yearly revenue. The\r\nconsequence was that the City had become greatly in debt. To remedy this\r\nstate of affairs various methods were resorted to. An attempt was made at\r\nthe commencement of the present reign to get the queen’s sanction for\r\ncompelling every governor, deputy governor, or committeeman of both the\r\nEast India companies to take up the freedom of the City. The question was\r\nreferred to the attorney-general, whose opinion on the matter was duly\r\nreported to the Common Council.(1906)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st July, 1703, another committee was appointed to examine the\r\nstate of the Chamber, and to consider of ways and means for its supply and\r\nfor the support of the government of the city. On the 18th August this\r\ncommittee recommended to the Common Council that an exact survey of all\r\nthe City’s estate should be made in each ward by the alderman and his\r\ndeputy, and that such surveys should be sent to the town clerk so that\r\nthey might be entered in a book. The court approved of the recommendation,\r\nand ordered that it should be carried out \"with all expedition\r\nimaginable.\"(1907) The City’s markets,(1908) the City’s beams(1909) and\r\neverything else that could be let on lease were let at improved rentals,\r\nand everything that could be sold was sold. On the 4th November (1703) the\r\nlord mayor (Sir John Parsons) informed the Common Council that towards the\r\npayment of the City’s debts his lordship and the two sheriffs had agreed\r\nto lay before the court certain papers showing (1) what the several places\r\nunder the Corporation would sell for, (2) what the lord mayor himself and\r\nthe sheriffs were willing to take for their share of each place, and (3)\r\nwhat part of the purchase-money might be devoted to the liquidation of the\r\nCity’s debts.(1910)\r\n\r\nThe schedule is an interesting one as showing the value attached to\r\nvarious offices under the City. Thus a water-bailiff’s place would sell\r\nfor £2,200, a sword-bearer’s for £2,500, and that of a clerk of the\r\nChamber for as much as £2,600 (the highest of all), whilst a City\r\nsolicitor could purchase his place for £1,500, and a City remembrancer\r\ncould do the same for £1,200. The scheme proposed by the mayor and\r\nsheriffs on this occasion affected no less than one hundred and\r\nsixty-three places of employment, and was simplicity itself, being nothing\r\nmore than that they themselves and their successors should forego\r\none-third of the value of any place that became vacant during their year\r\nof office, and that this third should be devoted to payment of the City’s\r\nliabilities. The total value of these purchaseable places amounted to\r\n£107,860, one-third of which, viz., £35,953 6_s._ 8_d._, would, if this\r\nproposal were carried out (and _if every place fell vacant within the\r\nyear_), be available for the discharge of the City’s debts. In a second\r\nschedule were set out certain other places filled chiefly by artificers,\r\nwho, by their extravagant charges, had contributed (it was said) in no\r\nsmall degree to the City’s indebtedness. These were to be excluded from\r\nthe scheme, much to their disappointment. When any one of them died,\r\nsurrendered his place or was dismissed from it for just cause, his place\r\nwas not to be filled up, and the payment of 10_s._ a week, more or less,\r\nwhich such artificer had been in the habit of receiving from the City,\r\n\"work or not work,\" was to cease.\r\n\r\nThe proposals thus laid before the Common Council met with the approval of\r\nthe court, and the committee was instructed to embody them in a Bill. A\r\nBill was accordingly drawn up and read the first time on the 4th February,\r\n1704. It passed on the 24th,(1911) and the thanks of the Common Council\r\nwere returned to the mayor and sheriffs for their generous offers.\r\n\r\n(M951)\r\n\r\nIn March, 1705, Marlborough sailed for Holland to resume the campaign. By\r\nJuly he had succeeded in forcing the French lines which stretched across\r\nthe country from Namur to Antwerp. For this success another thanksgiving\r\nservice was held at St. Paul’s, and attended by the queen in person (23\r\nAug.).(1912) Had the general been allowed a free hand by his Dutch allies\r\na decisive battle might have been fought. The Dutch officers refused,\r\nhowever, to co-operate in an attack, and Marlborough had to give way with\r\nthe best grace he could.\r\n\r\n(M952)\r\n\r\nDuring Marlborough’s absence the parliament of 1702, which would soon have\r\nterminated by efflux of time under the provisions of the Triennial Act,\r\nhad been dissolved (5 April) and a new one summoned. Once more the\r\npolitical pendulum swung back and a Whig parliament was returned. The\r\nTories rather injured than aided their cause by raising the cry that the\r\nChurch was in danger, whilst the Whig party was daily increasing in favour\r\nnot only with the queen, who highly resented such a cry, but also with\r\nMarlborough and Godolphin. In the city both parties put up four\r\ncandidates, but when the poll was declared it was found that all four\r\nWhigs had been returned by an overwhelming majority.(1913) One of the\r\nresults of an understanding arrived at between Marlborough and the Tory\r\nleaders with the Whig Junto was a modification of an article in the Act of\r\nSettlement, which, after the accession of the House of Hanover, would have\r\notherwise debarred ministers and other placemen from the House of Commons.\r\nA compromise was effected whereby only those who enjoyed a pension or\r\noffice created after the 25th October, 1705, were to be disqualified from\r\nsitting in the House, whilst all other offices were declared compatible\r\nwith a seat if the holder presented himself to his constituents for\r\nre-election at the time of his appointment.(1914) This arrangement is\r\nstill in force, although the necessity of it has long since disappeared.\r\n\r\n(M953)\r\n\r\nAfter a brief stay in England, where he had arrived at the opening of the\r\nnew year (1706), Marlborough again crossed over to Holland before the\r\nspring. A few weeks only elapsed before he gained fresh laurels by another\r\nsignal defeat of the French at the little village of Ramillies (12 May,\r\no.s.).(1915) On the 24th May the Common Council voted an address to the\r\nqueen congratulating her majesty on the victory.(1916) The 27th June was\r\nset apart as a day of public thanksgiving, for which the City made the\r\nusual preparations.(1917) But seeing that these gala days followed so\r\nclosely on one another the Court of Aldermen resolved that the new crimson\r\nvelvet gown with which the lord mayor was furnished on these occasions at\r\nthe City’s expense should no longer be appropriated by him, but should be\r\ncarefully laid up by the hall keeper for future use.(1918) At the humble\r\nrequest of the lord mayor (Sir Thomas Rawlinson) her majesty graciously\r\nconsented to bestow the trophies and colours recently taken in Flanders\r\nupon the City to the intent that they might be hung up in the Guildhall.\r\nIt was not, however, until the 19th December, when the Duke of Marlborough\r\nwas sumptuously entertained at Vintners’ Hall, that twenty-six standards\r\nand sixty-three colours, taken at Ramillies, were brought into the city in\r\ngreat state, there to be displayed on the walls of the Guildhall.(1919)\r\n\r\n(M954)\r\n\r\nThese successes were not achieved without great expenditure of blood and\r\nmoney. At the close of the previous year (1705) the lord mayor had\r\nreceived an order under the royal sign manual requiring him and the Court\r\nof Aldermen to forthwith impress 1,000 men—such as had no visible means of\r\nsubsistence—for service by land or sea,(1920) whilst in the following\r\nMarch (1706) it was found necessary to open a subscription at Mercers’\r\nChapel for furnishing Prince Eugene with £250,000 to assist him in\r\ncarrying on the campaign in Italy. Notwithstanding the depressed state of\r\nthe Corporation finances, the city abounded in wealth, and by the close of\r\nthe first day no less than £160,000 of the whole loan had been\r\nunderwritten, Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Sir William Scawen, Sir James Bateman\r\nand Sir Henry Furnese making themselves each responsible for the sum of\r\n£4,000.(1921) With the pecuniary assistance thus afforded him, and with\r\nthe reinforcements which Marlborough despatched to him from Holland, the\r\nprince was enabled to raise the siege of Turin (7 Sept., 1706).\r\n\r\n(M955)\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the crimson velvet gown was again brought into\r\nrequisition. So great success had attended the allied armies in 1706 that\r\nthe queen ordered another day of public thanksgiving to be kept on the\r\nlast day of the year, when she paid another solemn visit to St. Paul’s,\r\naccompanied by both Houses of Parliament. Strange to say the records of\r\nthe Court of Aldermen are absolutely silent as to the preparations made\r\nfor the occasion, but from another source we know them to have been on the\r\nsame scale as formerly, and we may depend upon it that the crimson velvet\r\ngown was there.(1922)\r\n\r\n(M956)\r\n\r\nThe city was at this time in great danger from the passage of large\r\nquantities of gunpowder through the streets on its way to the Tower. One\r\ncan realise the immense risk which the merchant and trader ran in pursuing\r\nhis regular vocation when one reads that on the 10th July (1706) a cart\r\nwith iron-bound wheels and laden with twenty-five barrels of gunpowder had\r\nbeen overturned on Fish Street Hill and the gunpowder scattered. Nor was\r\nthis the only accident that had occurred; the wonder is that the entire\r\ncity had not been blown up long since, seeing that gunpowder was a\r\ncommodity dealt in by grocers! The Common Council took the matter up and\r\nmade a representation to the queen.(1923) Next year a Bill was introduced\r\ninto the House of Commons by Sir Gilbert Heathcote and Samuel Shepheard,\r\ntwo of the city members, for preventing the dangers arising from bringing\r\nor laying up quantities of gunpowder within the city and liberties, but\r\nbefore the Lords and Commons could come to an agreement parliament was\r\nprorogued (24 April, 1707).(1924) The municipal authorities were not\r\ncontent to let matters rest here, but prepared a petition to parliament\r\nfor leave to bring in another Bill. The petition was ordered to lie on the\r\ntable (24 Feb., 1708),(1925) and in the meantime the citizens had to be\r\nsatisfied with an undertaking already given by powder-makers not to carry\r\nany gunpowder to any wharf or stairs within half a mile of London\r\nBridge.(1926)\r\n\r\n(M957)\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Union between England and Scotland having, after prolonged\r\ndiscussion, been ratified by both the English and Scottish parliaments and\r\nreceived the formal assent of the Crown, a day of public thanksgiving (1\r\nMay, 1707) was ordered to be observed for the happy conclusion of the\r\ntreaty between the two kingdoms. A proclamation had previously been issued\r\n(29 April) constituting the existing Houses of Lords and Commons the first\r\nparliament of Great Britain for and on the part of England, whilst sixteen\r\npeers and forty-five commoners were to be elected to represent Scotland in\r\nthe same parliament. The first meeting was to take place at Westminster on\r\nthe 23rd October.(1927) Meanwhile addresses of congratulation to the queen\r\narrived from various parts of the kingdom; but in consequence of the\r\nArticle of Union declaring the Presbyterian form to be the true Protestant\r\nreligion, no such address came from the University of Oxford. It was\r\notherwise with the city of London, where Presbyterianism had always been\r\nin favour. On the 9th May the Common Council voted an address to her\r\nmajesty congratulating her upon the happy union of the two kingdoms, a\r\nblessing which Heaven (they declared) had reserved for her to accomplish,\r\nwho was the true and sincere lover of piety, unity and concord.(1928)\r\n\r\n(M958)\r\n\r\nThe Londoners entertained sincere affection for Queen Anne, and lost no\r\nopportunity of showing their loyalty. Such an opportunity presented itself\r\nin the spring of the following year (1708), when Scotland was threatened\r\nby a French invasion in favour of the Pretender. The citizens hastened to\r\nassure her that the French preparations inspired them—her majesty’s most\r\ndutiful and loyal subjects—with no terror. The repeated tenders of their\r\nlives and fortunes were (she was asked to believe) not empty words, but\r\nthey would be ready when occasion offered to demonstrate to the world\r\ntheir unfeigned loyalty in support of her majesty and the maintenance of\r\nthe Protestant succession against the Pretender and all other enemies at\r\nhome and abroad.(1929)\r\n\r\n(M959)\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with mere assurances of support, parliament proceeded to\r\npass a Bill \"for the better security of her majesty’s person,\" by virtue\r\nof which the oath of abjuration was to be administered to all suspected\r\npersons, and those who refused it were to be at once treated as convict\r\nrecusants. The Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, and the House of Commons\r\nengaged to make good any extra expense her majesty might be put to by\r\nreason of this threatened invasion.(1930) On Tuesday, the 30th March, a\r\nletter from the Privy Council was read before the Court of Aldermen in\r\nwhich the magistrates of the city were commanded to meet as soon as\r\npossible for the purpose of tendering the oath, according to the\r\nprovisions of the recent Act. The court thereupon gave orders for precepts\r\nto be immediately issued to the deputies and common councilmen of the\r\nseveral wards requiring them to return a list in writing under their hands\r\nto the town clerk of all disaffected or dangerous persons found in their\r\nwards. The returns were to be made before the end of the week.(1931) This\r\ncould have been no easy matter considering the number of particulars that\r\nwere to be set out in the return according to the terms of the precept.\r\nThe deputy and common councilmen of each ward were called upon to\r\ndistinguish (1) all Papists or reputed Papists, (2) all such as preached\r\nin or frequented Jacobite meetings, (3) all non-jurors, _i.e._, such as\r\nhad refused to take the oaths appointed to be taken in place of the oaths\r\nof supremacy and allegiance, (4) all such as were found guilty of casting\r\naspersions upon her majesty and the government, (5) all persons suspected\r\nof holding correspondence with her majesty’s enemies abroad, and lastly\r\n(6) all spreaders of false and seditious reports. The christian names and\r\nsurnames of each and all of these, together with their place of abode,\r\nwere to be returned in less than a week in order that they might be\r\nsummoned and have the oath tendered to them.(1932)\r\n\r\n(M960)\r\n\r\nOn the 1st April parliament was prorogued; a fortnight later it was\r\ndissolved and writs for a new parliament were sent out on the 26th,\r\nreturnable on the following 8th July.(1933) Although the Whigs again\r\nobtained a majority in the country, and although they succeeded before the\r\nend of the year in ousting all Tories from the ministry, they were losing\r\nground in the city of London. In November last Withers, the lord mayor,\r\nhad obtained Clayton’s seat (on the latter’s decease) in the Tory interest\r\nas already mentioned.(1934) He was again returned after a close contest\r\nwith Sir Samuel Stanier, and with him another Tory in the person of John\r\nWard, who subsequently became an alderman and sat in the first parliament\r\nof George I. The other two seats were retained by the Whigs, Ashurst and\r\nHeathcote.(1935)\r\n\r\n(M961)\r\n\r\nBefore the elections were over news arrived of another victory gained by\r\nMarlborough. The French had been utterly defeated at Oudenarde (30 June,\r\no.s.).(1936) The fact that the Common Council allowed some weeks to slip\r\nby before voting a congratulatory address to the queen(1937) may possibly\r\nbe accounted for by the growing strength of the Tory party in the city,\r\nwith whom the war was never in favour. The victory was followed before the\r\nclose of the year by the capture of Lille, one of the strongest fortresses\r\nin Flanders, and the recovery of Bruges and Ghent, which had fallen into\r\nthe hands of the French general, Vendôme.(1938)\r\n\r\n(M962)\r\n\r\nThe general joy which succeeded the victory of Oudenarde was damped by the\r\nsomewhat sudden death of Prince George of Denmark, the queen’s husband.\r\nFor some time past the prince had been suffering from asthma, but it was\r\nnot until Monday, the 25th October, that graver symptoms appeared.(1939)\r\nOn that day he was attacked with dropsy and hæmorrhage, and the Court of\r\nAldermen thought so seriously of the attack that three days later (28\r\nOct.) they instructed the City Remembrancer to repair daily to Kensington\r\nto enquire after the prince’s health.(1940) That same afternoon, however,\r\nthe prince died, and the City’s address, presented to the queen a month\r\nlater, whilst congratulating her on her victories abroad, condoled with\r\nher majesty on the loss she had sustained at home.(1941) The sad event\r\nhappening so close upon lord mayor’s day, when Sir Charles Duncombe was to\r\nbe sworn into office, the customary pageant on such occasions was\r\nforegone, the mayor-elect contenting himself with driving to Westminster\r\nHall attended only by some of his brother aldermen.(1942)\r\n\r\n(M963)\r\n\r\nAfter a futile attempt to arrange terms for a cessation of hostilities\r\nboth parties again took the field. Tournay having been reduced by the\r\nallies under Marlborough and Eugene, they next proceeded to threaten Mons.\r\nIn order to protect this stronghold Villars, the French marshal,\r\nentrenched himself at Malplaquet. From this post, however, the allies\r\nsucceeded in driving him after a \"very bloody battle,\" in which the\r\nvictors lost more men than the defeated (31 Aug., o.s.).(1943) The\r\ncitizens of London, in an address to the queen, expressed their delight at\r\nthe prospect of the French king being soon compelled to accept\r\nterms.(1944) Tuesday, the 22nd November, was ordered to be observed as a\r\nday of public thanksgiving for the victory of \"Blaregnies,\" by which name\r\nthe battle of Malplaquet was sometimes known.(1945)\r\n\r\n(M964)\r\n\r\nBefore another campaign was opened the ascendancy of the Whigs had passed\r\naway. They had rendered themselves the more obnoxious to the citizens by\r\nthe passing of an Act for the naturalization of foreign Protestants,(1946)\r\nthe result of which had been to overcrowd the city with needy foreigners\r\nat a time when there was a great scarcity of provisions. A cry was raised\r\nthat the price of corn and bread was being enhanced by the action of\r\nforestallers, and the lord mayor was instructed by letter from Sunderland\r\n(3 Oct., 1709) to put the law in force against all engrossers,\r\nforestallers and regraters of corn. The mayor in reply assured the\r\nsecretary of state that there were no such engrossers in the city, but\r\nthat the present dearness was caused by the exportation of large\r\nquantities of corn and grain to foreign countries. The city authorities\r\nhad, moreover, been informed that wheat was selling in the north of\r\nEngland at 40_s._ a quarter and less. They therefore suggested that\r\ngovernment should furnish a sufficient convoy for the purpose of bringing\r\nit to London.(1947) The representation as to the evils arising from\r\nexportation of corn had the desired effect, for a Bill was shortly\r\nafterwards passed limiting such importation,(1948) whilst another Bill was\r\npassed for regulating the assize of bread.(1949)\r\n\r\n(M965) (M966)\r\n\r\nThe bitter feeling against the Whigs engendered by their overbearing and\r\ndictatorial conduct whenever in power was increased by a sermon preached\r\nat St. Paul’s on the 5th November before the lord mayor and aldermen by\r\nDr. Sacheverell, a high church Tory. Taking for his text the words of the\r\nApostle, \"In perils among false brethren\" (2 Cor., xi, 26), the preacher\r\nadvocated in its entirety the doctrine of non-resistance, condemned every\r\nsort of toleration, and attacked with much bitterness the Dissenters. Sir\r\nSamuel Garrard, who had but recently entered on his duties as lord mayor\r\n(having been elected in place of Sir Jeffery Jeffreys, who had been\r\nexcused from office on the ground of ill-health),(1950) was himself also a\r\nhigh Tory, and as such was greatly pleased with the sentiments put forth\r\nby Sacheverell. He congratulated the preacher on his sermon, and is said\r\nto have expressed a hope that it would be printed. If so, it would appear\r\nto betoken some doubt in his mind as to his brother aldermen consenting to\r\nprint such a polemical discourse. As a rule all sermons preached on state\r\noccasions before the mayor and aldermen were ordered by the court to be\r\nprinted as a matter of course, the sum of forty shillings being voted\r\ntowards the expense. Two sermons recently preached before them, one at St.\r\nPaul’s and the other in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, were so ordered\r\n(8 Nov.) to be printed by the court; but when on the same day the question\r\nwas put to them that Dr. Sacheverell should be desired to print his sermon\r\nit was negatived.(1951) Sacheverell took no notice of this rebuff, but\r\nprinted the sermon on his own responsibility and at his own expense, with\r\na prefatory dedication to the mayor.(1952) The sermon was immensely\r\npopular with the high church party, and a large number of copies were\r\ncirculated, much to the disgust of the Whigs.\r\n\r\n(M967)\r\n\r\nAt length the ministry resolved to take proceedings against the author. On\r\nthe 13th December a complaint was made to the House of Commons of this\r\nsermon, as well as of another sermon of similar character which had been\r\npreached by Sacheverell before the judges at the last summer assizes at\r\nDerby. After some debate the House resolved that both these sermons were\r\n\"malicious, scandalous and seditious libels highly reflecting upon her\r\nmajesty and her government, the late happy revolution, and the Protestant\r\nsuccession as by law established,\" and ordered that Dr. Henry Sacheverell\r\nand Henry Clements, his publisher, should attend at the Bar of the House\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\n(M968)\r\n\r\nAccordingly the next day (14 Dec.) the doctor and the bookseller appeared.\r\nSacheverell owned that he was the author of the two discourses, and gave\r\nan account of what had taken place between himself and the lord mayor; but\r\nwhilst expressing his regret at having incurred the displeasure of the\r\nHouse, he showed no contrition for the doctrines he had promulgated. The\r\nlord mayor, who was present in the House in his capacity as member for\r\nAgmondesham, was thereupon asked if he had given any orders for causing\r\nthe sermon preached at St. Paul’s to be printed, but he denied having done\r\nso.(1953) The doctor being called upon to retire, the House resolved to\r\nimpeach him of high crimes and misdemeanours and in the meantime committed\r\nhim to the custody of the sergeant-at-arms. Application was made a few\r\ndays later for bail to be allowed, but this the House refused.(1954) It\r\nwas, however, subsequently granted by the Lords, but at a very high\r\namount, viz., Sacheverell himself in £6,000 and two sureties in £3,000\r\nrespectively. One of these sureties was no other than the Vice-Chancellor\r\nof Oxford University, of which Sacheverell was a member.(1955)\r\n\r\n(M969)\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended that the trial should take place at the Bar of\r\nthe House of Lords, but as the Commons insisted upon being present as a\r\ncommittee of the whole House, the Lords appointed Westminster Hall to be\r\nthe place of trial and instructed Sir Christopher Wren to make the\r\nnecessary preparations as speedily as possible.(1956) The trial commenced\r\non the 27th February and continued for three weeks. Day after day as\r\nSacheverell passed from his lodgings in the Temple to Westminster Hall and\r\nhome again his coach was besieged by crowds striving to kiss his hand and\r\nshouting \"Sacheverell and the Church for ever!\" So again when the queen,\r\nimpelled by curiosity, attended the trial, as she did on more than one\r\noccasion, shouts were raised as she passed on her way of \"God bless your\r\nmajesty and the Church! we hope your majesty is for Dr. Sacheverell!\" Had\r\nthe mob confined itself to this kind of demonstration little harm had been\r\ndone. Unfortunately it allowed itself to be carried away by excitement and\r\ntook to attacking meeting-houses and damaging the property of\r\nDissenters.(1957) The arguments on both sides having at last been\r\nconcluded, the Lords, by a narrow majority, pronounced Sacheverell guilty.\r\nThey did not venture, however, to proceed against him with any greater\r\nseverity than to order his sermons to be burnt at the Exchange by the\r\ncommon hangman, in the presence of the lord mayor and sheriffs, and to\r\nprohibit him from preaching for the next three years.(1958) Such a\r\nsentence was virtually a victory for the Tories and a defeat of the Whigs.\r\nLord mayor Garrard contrived to escape the humiliation of presiding over\r\nthe burning of a sermon of which he in his heart approved, and this part\r\nof the sentence was carried out in his absence under the supervision of\r\nthe sheriffs.(1959) The verdict was welcomed in the city with\r\nilluminations and bonfires, accompanied with some little tumult and\r\ndisorder. The queen complained to the Court of Aldermen by letter, and\r\nthereupon the court appointed a committee to investigate the recent riots\r\n(27 March, 1710). The result was that the ringleaders were arrested and\r\nbound over to the sessions.(1960) The streets were flooded with republican\r\npamphlets which the House ordered to be burnt by the common hangman.(1961)\r\nAddresses were sent in from all parts of the country, some in favour of\r\nthe existing parliament, but the majority advocated a speedy\r\ndissolution.(1962) The Common Council voted an address (but only by a\r\nsmall majority) in which her majesty was assured of the City’s hatred of\r\nall \"anti-monarchical principles,\" its continued loyalty to her person and\r\ngovernment, its zeal for the Church of England, its tender regard for\r\nliberty of conscience and its resolution to maintain the Protestant\r\nsuccession. The address concluded by saying that in obedience to her\r\nmajesty’s commands the civic authorities would do their utmost care to\r\nprevent and suppress riotous assemblies.(1963) The address, together with\r\none from the lieutenancy of London, was presented to the queen on the 13th\r\nApril.(1964)\r\n\r\n(M970)\r\n\r\nThe queen seized the opportunity afforded her by this outburst of Tory\r\nenthusiasm to get rid of the Whig ministry. For some time past she had\r\nbeen anxious to free herself from Marlborough and the domineering\r\ninfluence of his wife. During the trial of Sacheverell Marlborough had\r\nbeen on the continent. In view of the approaching struggle between Whigs\r\nand Tories, both parties preferred to be relieved of his presence. To this\r\nend Sir Gilbert Heathcote, one of the Whig members for the city, had moved\r\nan address to her majesty (16 Feb.) praying she would order the duke to\r\nHolland, \"where his presence will be equally necessary to assist at the\r\nnegotiations of peace and to hasten the preparations for an early\r\ncampaign.\"(1965) The address, having received the unanimous assent of both\r\nHouses, was graciously received by the queen, and Marlborough had set out.\r\nIn his absence the queen proceeded cautiously to effect her object. One by\r\none the Whigs were removed from office and their places filled up by\r\nTories. Sunderland was the first to go, the seals being transferred to\r\nLord Dartmouth. It was feared in commercial circles that his dismissal\r\nbetokened a general change of ministry and that a panic would follow. The\r\nqueen, however, assured Sir Gilbert Heathcote, at that time governor of\r\nthe Bank of England, that she had no immediate intention of making further\r\nchanges, but that if any were made she would take care that they should\r\nnot be prejudicial to the bank or to the common cause.(1966)\r\nNotwithstanding the assurances thus given, less than two months elapsed\r\nbefore Godolphin was made to follow Sunderland. After this many of the\r\nWhig ministers resigned, whilst others waited to be turned out.\r\n\r\n(M971) (M972)\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the dismissal of Godolphin the queen insisted on\r\ndissolving parliament, and writs were issued (27 Sept.) for a new House to\r\nmeet in November.(1967) Harley, who was the queen’s chief adviser, having\r\nfailed in an attempt to form a coalition of Tories and moderate Whigs,\r\nplaced all his hopes in the result of a general election. Every effort was\r\nmade to get a Tory majority returned, and with success. Bishop Burnet,\r\nwhose Whiggish proclivities are apparent in every page of his history,\r\ntook no pains to disguise his opinions as to the way the elections were\r\ngenerally carried out, and more particularly in the city of London. \"While\r\nthe poll was taken in London,\" he writes,(1968) \"a new commission for the\r\nlieutenancy of the city was sent in, by which a great change was made;\r\nTories were put in and Whigs were left out; in a word, the practice and\r\nviolence now used in elections went far beyond anything that I have ever\r\nknown in England.\" If freedom of election was to count for anything, the\r\nworthy bishop entertained grave doubts as to the new parliament being a\r\nrepresentative parliament at all. Only one of the old members was returned\r\nby the city, viz., Sir William Withers. With him were elected another\r\nalderman of the city, viz., Sir Richard Hoare, who had been defeated in\r\nthe Tory interest at the last election, Sir George Newland and John\r\nCass,(1969) who afterwards became an alderman, and who, at his decease,\r\nleft money for the foundation of a school in the parish of St. Botoph,\r\nAldgate.\r\n\r\n(M973)\r\n\r\nThe new House of Commons being strongly Tory, Harley and St. John found\r\nthemselves compelled to form a purely Tory ministry. On the 27th the queen\r\ndelivered a speech in person, reflecting, as was supposed, the policy of\r\nthe new ministry. To carry on the war with the utmost vigour was, she\r\ndeclared, the surest way of procuring a safe and honourable peace for\r\nEngland and her allies, and in February of the following year (1711)\r\nMarlborough was despatched for the avowed purpose of carrying this policy\r\ninto execution, the Commons being called upon to furnish supplies. Yet in\r\nthe midst of all this Harley commenced opening secret negotiations for a\r\npeace with France, regardless of the interests of England’s allies. By\r\nSeptember (1711) these negotiations had so far progressed that\r\npreliminaries for a peace were actually signed, but for fear lest the\r\nfavourable terms obtained for England should provoke the jealousy of the\r\nDutch a garbled edition of the treaty was specially prepared for the\r\nedification of our allies. Such was the political morality of the age!\r\n\r\n(M974)\r\n\r\nThe High Church party being in power, the queen took the opportunity of\r\nenlisting their support for a project she had much at heart. For some time\r\npast the want of new churches in the fast increasing suburbs of London had\r\nengaged the attention of convocation, by whom the matter had been\r\nrepresented to the queen. Her majesty now commended \"so good and pious a\r\nwork\" to the attention of the Commons, a commendation which received\r\nadditional force from the presentation of petitions from ministers of\r\nvarious parishes in and around London for assistance in carrying out\r\nrepairs. The Commons showed considerable zeal in the matter, declaring, in\r\ntheir reply to her majesty’s address, that neither the long expensive war\r\nin which they were engaged nor the pressure of heavy debts should hinder\r\nthem from granting whatever was necessary.(1970) A Bill was accordingly\r\nbrought in (18 May) for the purpose of building fifty new churches,\r\ncomputing 4,750 souls to each church, as well as for providing annual sums\r\nof money to be expended on the completion of Westminster Abbey and\r\nGreenwich Hospital. The cost was to be defrayed by a further duty on coal.\r\nBy the 28th May the Bill passed the Commons.(1971)\r\n\r\n(M975)\r\n\r\nIn June (1711) parliament was prorogued and did not meet again before\r\nDecember. A compromise was then effected which reflected little credit\r\nupon either of the political parties, but secured the passing of the\r\nOccasional Conformity Bill, a Bill on which the queen and the high Tories\r\nhad set their hearts, but which had already been defeated twice by the\r\nLords. The object of the Bill was to inflict penalties upon those\r\nDissenters who, having qualified themselves to sit as common councilmen or\r\nas officers in corporations or elsewhere by receiving the Sacrament,\r\nafterwards betook themselves to places of worship where the Book of Common\r\nPrayer was not used, and where neither the queen nor the Princess Sophia\r\nwere prayed for.(1972)\r\n\r\n(M976)\r\n\r\nIn September (1711) party spirit ran high in the city, the occasion being\r\nthe election of an alderman for the ward of Broad Street in the place of\r\nSir Joseph Woolfe, deceased. No less than four candidates were nominated\r\nby each side, two out of each four being already aldermen. The Tory or\r\nChurch party were represented by Sir William Withers and William Lewen,\r\naldermen, Sir George Newland and Sir Robert Dunkley, commoners. The Whigs\r\nor Dissenters advocated Sir John Houblon and Sir Samuel Stanier, aldermen,\r\nSir John Scott and Gerrard Conyers, commoners. The wardmote was held at\r\nDrapers’ Hall, and was presided over by Sir Gilbert Heathcote, the mayor,\r\na strong Whig. It appears from a newspaper of the day(1973) that although\r\nthe mayor caused the Act of Common Council, setting forth the\r\nqualifications of persons who had a right to vote on the occasion, to be\r\nread at the wardmote, he refused to make proclamation that those who were\r\nnot qualified should depart from the hall. The result was that a large\r\nnumber of foreigners and other unqualified persons voted. The lord mayor\r\nhaving declared the show of hands to be in favour of the four Whig\r\ncandidates, a poll was demanded, which reversed the mayor’s decision. A\r\nscrutiny was next asked for and allowed, but the mayor steadily refused to\r\nexpress any opinion as to who of the voters were qualified and who were\r\ndisqualified without first consulting counsel. The result of the scrutiny\r\nwas declared (27 Oct.) by the mayor to be in favour of all four Whig\r\ncandidates, and on the following day he made a report to that effect to\r\nthe Court of Aldermen, who thereupon elected Gerrard Conyers alderman of\r\nthe ward. The mayor’s decision, however, was challenged, and a motion was\r\nmade in the Queen’s Bench for setting it aside as being manifestly wrong\r\nand not in accordance with the number of lawful votes. After Heathcote’s\r\nyear of office had expired the assistance of the Common Council was\r\ninvoked in support of the rights of electors against such arbitrary\r\nproceedings as had recently taken place. The court agreed to the necessary\r\nlegal expenses being defrayed by the Chamber.(1974)\r\n\r\nThe practice of nominating as many as four candidates for a vacant\r\naldermanry had prevailed since the commencement of the 15th century,(1975)\r\nbut the inconvenience arising from this practice became so manifest during\r\nthis last election that the Common Council passed an Act before the result\r\nof the election had been declared, abolishing the custom and enacting that\r\nhenceforth only two candidates should be put in nomination, one an\r\nalderman and the other a commoner.(1976) Even this number was found too\r\nmany, and within three years was reduced to one commoner,(1977) thus\r\nreverting to the primitive custom of the city before it was enacted,\r\n_temp._ Richard II, that two (commoners) _at least_ should be nominated\r\nfor every vacant aldermanry.(1978)\r\n\r\nIn July, 1712, another dispute arose over the election of an alderman. Sir\r\nJohn Fleet, alderman of the ward of Langbourn, had recently died, and it\r\nwas necessary to appoint a successor. Four candidates were put up for the\r\npost, of whom two were to be selected for nomination to the Court of\r\nAldermen according to the provisions of the recent Act. The wardmote was\r\nopened on the 9th July at Pewterers’ Hall. Sir Robert Beachcroft, the lord\r\nmayor, was himself one of the candidates, the other three being Sir\r\nWilliam Withers, alderman, Sir Samuel Clarke and Peter Delmé, commoners.\r\nThe show of hands being declared to be in favour of Withers and Clarke,\r\ntwo Tories, a poll was demanded on behalf of his lordship and Delmé. The\r\nresult, however, was the same, and a scrutiny followed. To the great\r\nsurprise of a large body of the electors, the mayor eventually declared\r\n(22 Aug.) the majority of votes to be in favour of himself and Delmé, but\r\nlike his predecessor he steadily refused to give any explanation as to how\r\nhe had arrived at that conclusion. Again there appeared to be no remedy\r\nbut to apply to the Queen’s Bench. The Common Council was again appealed\r\nto (6 Sept.), but whilst the matter was in course of debate the lord mayor\r\nwas suddenly taken ill, and the court had to break up before coming to any\r\nresolution on the matter. On the 12th November, however, the council\r\nagreed to assist the petitioners as before, but refused any assistance to\r\nDelmé, who had already been admitted alderman, and was about to be put on\r\nhis defence.(1979)\r\n\r\n(M977)\r\n\r\nIn 1713 the relations between the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council\r\nbecame still more strained. The latter complained of the city’s business\r\nbeing hindered from insufficient Courts of Aldermen, and of a newly\r\nelected alderman not having been sworn in on a certain day by reason of\r\nthere not being a _quorum_ of aldermen present. On the 15th May a joint\r\ncommittee of aldermen and commoners was appointed to enquire into the\r\nmatter. Six weeks elapsed before the committee was ready with its report.\r\nAt length, on the 30th June, the committee certified(1980) that having\r\nexamined the minute books of the Court of Aldermen it had found that\r\nbetween the 24th March and the 15th May last six courts had been summoned\r\nto meet, but for want of a _quorum_ only one full court had been held. On\r\nthe other occasions only seven, eight, nine, ten or twelve aldermen\r\nappeared, inclusive of the mayor. The committee also found that the courts\r\nwere in the habit of meeting between twelve and one o’clock, and reported\r\nits opinion that such a late hour for meeting was prejudicial to the\r\ncitizens and others who had business there.\r\n\r\nTouching the other matter which had been referred to them, the committee\r\nfound that on the 7th May the lord mayor had reported to the Court of\r\nAldermen the nomination and election of Sir William Withers, alderman, and\r\nJoseph Lawrence to succeed Sir Owen Buckingham in the aldermanry of the\r\nward of Bishopsgate; that Withers declining to remove, had moved that\r\nLawrence should be called in and sworn, according to the provisions of the\r\nAct of 1711 for regulating the elections of aldermen; that thereupon a\r\npetition was offered and part of the Act was read; that after some debate\r\nLawrence was sent for and came into court; that upon the Common Sergeant\r\nbeing called in to give his opinion seven of the aldermen withdrew from\r\nthe court, but one of them presently returned, and after hearing the\r\nCommon Sergeant deliver his opinion—viz., that notwithstanding any\r\npetition the court was bound by the Act to admit and swear in\r\nLawrence—again withdrew, notwithstanding the lord mayor’s expressed desire\r\nthat he should remain; that by this means a full court was not kept (only\r\neleven aldermen being left with the mayor), and so Lawrence, although\r\npresent, could not be sworn.(1981) The committee’s report was ordered to\r\nbe entered on the Journal and likewise to be forthwith printed and a copy\r\nsent to every member of the Common Council.\r\n\r\n(M978)\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the queen had been persuaded to dismiss Marlborough on his\r\nreturn to England (Nov., 1711) from all his offices, and to place the Duke\r\nof Ormond, a strong Tory, in command of the English forces in the\r\nNetherlands. Negotiations with France were simultaneously pushed on, in\r\nspite of a personal visit which Eugene himself paid to London (Jan., 1712)\r\nin the hope of obtaining a continuance of English support for carrying on\r\nthe war. The presence of the illustrious prince was heartily welcomed by\r\nthe Whigs, by whom he was hospitably entertained. On the 15th January a\r\nmotion was made in the Court of Aldermen and carried to the effect that\r\nthe court was prepared to join with as many leading citizens (not\r\nexceeding sixty in number) as should be willing in providing an\r\nentertainment by private subscription for his highness, provided they\r\nfirst obtained her majesty’s permission. Two aldermen were thereupon\r\nnominated to wait upon Lord Dartmouth, principal secretary of state, in\r\norder to learn her majesty’s pleasure. There was nothing unusual in this\r\nproceeding. Nevertheless the idea of the prince being publicly entertained\r\nin the city was so distasteful to the queen and her government that she\r\nfound fault with the citizens for daring to approach her with a mere\r\nverbal message (she was suffering from gout at the time),(1982) and\r\ndeclined to return an answer to any message which was not brought to her\r\n\"with the same respect as has always been paid by the city of London to\r\nher predecessors.\"(1983) That there might be no mistake about the matter\r\nthe queen’s answer was sent to the City in writing by Lord Dartmouth. The\r\nCourt of Aldermen at once appointed a committee to search the City’s\r\nRecords for the purpose of ascertaining how and in what manner messages\r\nhad been delivered from the court to her majesty and her predecessors,\r\nwhether they had usually been in writing or only verbal. On the 5th\r\nFebruary the committee reported that they found that such messages had\r\nbeen delivered in a variety of ways: sometimes by the lord mayor alone,\r\nsometimes by two or three aldermen, and at other times by the recorder and\r\nsheriffs only. One instance had been found of a message having been sent\r\nby a single sheriff. Not once did they find that a message had been\r\ndelivered in writing.(1984) It need scarcely be said that under the\r\ncircumstances all idea of the entertainment was dropt.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the prince’s high character the greatest calumnies were\r\nwhispered against him behind his back. He was said to be conspiring with\r\nMarlborough and the Whigs to raise an insurrection in the streets, fire\r\nthe city and seize the person of the queen. A general panic prevailed.\r\nEven the roysterings of a few drunken revellers calling themselves\r\n\"Mohocks\"(1985)—the successors of the \"Roreres\" and \"Riffleres\" of a past\r\nage—were looked upon as signs and tokens of some deep laid plot, so that\r\nmore than ordinary precautions had to be taken, both in the city and\r\nelsewhere, to prevent riot.(1986) Finding at length that his presence in\r\nEngland did not promote his object the prince, after a stay of some weeks,\r\nreturned to the Hague.\r\n\r\n(M979)\r\n\r\nBy the 6th June negotiations with France had so far advanced that the\r\nqueen went down to the House of Lords to fulfil, as she said, her promise\r\nof communicating to her parliament the terms of peace before it was\r\nabsolutely concluded. What pleased the citizens most in her elaborate\r\nspeech was the announcement of the steps taken to secure the Protestant\r\nsuccession to the House of Hanover and for protecting British commerce.\r\nFor these measures they returned to her majesty their hearty thanks, and\r\nexpressed their sincere hopes that she might speedily finish the good work\r\nwhich had advanced so far notwithstanding \"the artful contrivances and\r\nenvious efforts of a factious and malicious party.\"(1987) In August a\r\nproclamation was made of a suspension of hostilities,(1988) and on the\r\n31st March, 1713, the Peace of Utrecht was signed.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later (14 April, 1713) the Common Council voted a\r\ncongratulatory address to her majesty on the conclusion of the peace with\r\nFrance, but no copy of the address was to be shown to anyone until it had\r\nbeen actually presented.(1989) On the 5th May the lord mayor and Court of\r\nAldermen attended at Temple Bar to assist at the proclamation, whilst\r\nTuesday the 6th July was observed as a day of public thanksgiving at St.\r\nPaul’s. The queen did not attend the service owing probably to\r\nindisposition, and the livery companies were on that account excused\r\nattendance. The mayor and aldermen displayed no little anxiety to have\r\ntheir proper seats reserved for them in the cathedral.(1990)\r\n\r\n(M980)\r\n\r\nShortly before the conclusion of the peace the term of Sacheverell’s\r\nsuspension expired. His popularity became greater than ever. The queen\r\npresented him with the living of St. Andrew’s, Holborn, whilst the House\r\nof Commons, which had formerly condemned him, now invited him to preach\r\nbefore them.(1991)\r\n\r\n(M981)\r\n\r\nThe days of Queen Anne were now fast drawing to a close. For some time\r\npast her health had been failing, and at the close of the year (1713) she\r\nwas confined to her bed at Windsor. Upon notice of her indisposition being\r\nconveyed to the Court of Aldermen they at once instructed the sheriffs and\r\nthe city remembrancer to proceed to Windsor and enquire after her\r\nmajesty’s health.(1992) The fact that in the event of the queen’s death\r\nthe legal heir, the Electress Sophia, and her son, the Elector of Hanover,\r\nwere favourable to the Whig party, drove the Tories to make overtures to\r\nthe Pretender, the queen’s brother, who was still living in France,\r\nalthough by the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht Louis had promised to\r\nabandon his cause. On the 1st February (1714) the queen wrote to the lord\r\nmayor(1993) (Sir Samuel Stanier) informing him that she was recovering her\r\nhealth and hoped soon to return to her \"usual residence.\" She further\r\ninformed his lordship of her determination to open her parliament on the\r\n16th, according to the notice given by proclamation, and desired him to\r\ncommunicate the same to the Court of Aldermen and to her other loving\r\nsubjects of the city. Again the sheriffs and remembrancer were instructed\r\nto go to Windsor and tender the court’s acknowledgments of her majesty’s\r\nfavour and to assure her that they would discountenance to the utmost of\r\ntheir power and put a stop to \"those malicious rumours which had been so\r\nindustriously spread by evil disposed persons to the prejudice of credit\r\nand the imminent hazard of public peace and tranquility.\"(1994) Saturday\r\nthe 6th was the queen’s birthday, and extra precautions were taken in the\r\ncity to prevent tumult or disorder.(1995) A week later her majesty had so\r\nfar recovered her health as to meditate returning to town, and the Common\r\nCouncil prepared (12 Feb.) to greet her with a congratulatory\r\naddress.(1996)\r\n\r\n(M982)\r\n\r\nOn the 21st June (1714) a royal proclamation was issued offering a reward\r\nof £5,000 for the apprehension of the Pretender in case he should effect a\r\nlanding.(1997) The proclamation afforded the City an opportunity of\r\nfurther testifying its loyalty to the queen and its determination to\r\nuphold the Protestant succession as by law established, and at the same\r\ntime to thank her majesty for passing an Act entitled \"An Act to prevent\r\nthe growth of Schism\"—an Act aimed against the Whigs, and which forbade\r\nanyone keeping a school without licence from the bishop.(1998)\r\n\r\n(M983)\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Friday the 30th July the queen was seized with her last\r\nillness. Notification was immediately despatched to the lord mayor, who\r\nreported the news to a special Court of Aldermen that afternoon. The\r\nSecretary of State, who had written to the mayor, had desired his lordship\r\nto take immediate steps to preserve quiet in the city. The court, on being\r\ninformed of the turn of affairs, despatched the sheriffs, the common cryer\r\nand the water bailiff to Kensington to enquire after the queen’s health\r\nand to assure her majesty that every possible care would be taken to\r\npreserve the peace of the city in any event.(1999) Two days later (1 Aug.)\r\nAnne was dead.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

The City had tried to get rid of\r\n      Montague (in 1610) on the same grounds, but failed owing to the\r\n      intervention of the king, who emphatically declared that in calling\r\n      Montague to be a sergeant-at-law he intended a further mark of\r\n      favour to him and to the City, and did not intend that he should\r\n      lose his place.—Remembrancia (Index), p. 288.\r\n\r\n  970 Repertory 59, fo. 474.

According to the evidence of the State\r\n      Papers the king appears to have suggested Bolton’s appointment as\r\n      surveyor-general by letters to the Common Council, dated the 31st\r\n      May and the 5th June, 1667 (Cal. State Papers Dom., 1667, pp. 133,\r\n      151). It does not, however, appear to have been considered by the\r\n      Common Council until the 14th Sept. There may have been good reason\r\n      for the City declining to place the mayor in such a responsible\r\n      position of trust, for a few weeks later (3 Dec.) he was suspected\r\n      of misappropriating money subscribed to assist the poor of the city,\r\n      and pending enquiry was forbidden to attend the Court of Aldermen or\r\n      any public function (Repertory 73, fos. 28b, 61, 93b, 95, 95b,\r\n      107b). After bringing a charge against the Bishop of London in\r\n      September, 1668, of misappropriating the sum of £50, and afterwards\r\n      withdrawing, he was himself convicted in 1675 of having embezzled\r\n      large sums of money intended for the poor (Repertory 73, fos. 260b,\r\n      264, 292b, 303; Repertory 80, fo. 119b). Reduced to poverty, he was\r\n      granted by the City an allowance of £3 a week, which after his\r\n      decease was continued to his widow (Journal 49, fo. 100b).\r\n\r\n M685 Classification of streets, lanes, etc., 21 March. 1667.\r\n\r\n 1356 Journal 46, fos. 148b, 149.\r\n\r\n 1357 Original notification from the court at Whitehall, 22 March, 1667,\r\n      preserved in the Town Clerk’s office.\r\n\r\n 1358 Journal 46, fos. 151-152.\r\n\r\n 1359 The sums of money disbursed by the chamberlain between June and\r\n      November, 1667, for this purpose are kept on record.—See Report on\r\n      Corporation Records, 1869, Appendix iii, \"Chamberlain’s Strong\r\n      Room.\"\r\n\r\n 1360 Journal 46, fo. 172.\r\n\r\n M686 Allotment of market sites.\r\n\r\n 1361 Id., fos. 187b-188.\r\n\r\n 1362 Journal 46, fos. 210, 210b.\r\n\r\n 1363 Pepys, Diary.\r\n\r\n M687 The coal duty raised to 2 _s._ a chaldron. 1670.
