The Sea Dyak soon appeared in print; travellers mentioned\r\nhim, sometimes only as a simple savage; men who have spent some time\r\nin the country, like the late Sir Hugh Low and the late Sir Spenser\r\nSt. John, described something of his life; missionary reports had him\r\nin their pages; European residents and civil administrators and others\r\nwrote of him in various papers and periodicals. But most, if not all,\r\nof these accounts were unavoidably brief, partial, and sketchy, for it\r\ndid not come within the scope of their purpose to set forth a full and\r\nsystematic statement of all things Dyak. Mr. Ling Roth collected all the\r\nnotes about Dyaks he could find, from various sources, and published\r\nhis harvest of accumulations in two large volumes. It is a monument of\r\nindustrious collecting; but his work is that of the scissors rather than\r\nof the pen, a compilation rather than a writing; and in the extracts,\r\nbeing the productions of various writers at different periods, we see\r\nmuch overlapping and repetition, and some confusion; and, necessarily,\r\nsuch a book was too bulky to obtain a general circulation. More recently\r\nMiss Eda Green has given to English readers a little book about Borneo,\r\nwonderful in its general accuracy, and vivid in its descriptions; but\r\nit is meant especially for missionary circles and missionary reading—in\r\nfact, it was written expressly for the Borneo Mission Association, whose\r\nobjects it has done much to promote. But it is a book about the Mission\r\nrather than about the Dyaks, and it does not profess to give a complete\r\naccount of the entire field of Sea Dyak life.\r\n\r\nThis is Mr. Gomes’s object, and he attains it. His book is not a mere\r\npersonal narrative of life in Sarawak. We have in it a very full,\r\nsystematic, and comprehensive description of Sea Dyak life—its works,\r\nthoughts, sentiments, superstitions, customs, religion, beliefs, and\r\nideals. Our attention is not directed to the magnificent beauties of\r\nBornean tropical scenery and luxuriant flora, nor to the wonders of the\r\ninsect life with which the land simply abounds. Mr. Gomes sees Dyaks,\r\nand Dyaks only, in his mind. The “brown humanity” of the country, not\r\nits natural history, occupies his attention. He knows that humanity\r\nintimately, and writes from the storehouse which he has accumulated\r\nin long years of experience and observation. And he puts all within\r\nmanageable compass and volume. His book is, I believe, the first which\r\ncontains a complete picture of Sea Dyak life in all its phases, yet in\r\nmoderate dimensions. And from my own experience of some twenty years in\r\nSarawak, I can testify to the truthfulness of every page.\r\n\r\nPossibly it is sometimes thought that the missionary is not the best\r\nman to write about the people to whom he appeals; that he may be easily\r\nbiassed in one direction or another, and may think too ill or too well\r\nof them, and may allow his judgment to be overcoloured by his religious\r\npurpose. A _little_ experience among the people of any race, especially\r\nwhere the language is not well known, may easily result in limited\r\nviews and imperfect conceptions. But when his residence has extended\r\nover many years, and he knows the language as well as his own; when he\r\nhas had constant opportunities of observing their tone and conduct in\r\nevery relation of life, and of hearing how they talk and think on every\r\nimaginable subject, and of seeing how they behave at home as well as\r\nabroad—how they bear themselves, not only to an occasional white man whom\r\nthey meet, but also to each other in social dealings—when he thus lives\r\nin close touch with them at every point, he cannot but obtain a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the realities of their lives.\r\n\r\nAnd the Sea Dyaks are generally a very communicative people. They will\r\nwillingly give information about every belief and custom, and will\r\nquietly discuss every practice and every event, good or bad; and it needs\r\nonly a little patience and sympathy to enable one to get an insight into\r\nthe working of their minds, and to realize the true character of their\r\nactions in the struggles, the comedies, or the tragedies of their lives.\r\n\r\nMr. Gomes is thus able to make the Sea Dyak live before us in genuine\r\ncolours. We can see this dusky son of the jungle in his beliefs and\r\nfears, which are many, in his work and in his play, in his ugly faults\r\nand amiable virtues, in his weaknesses and in his abilities. And I think\r\nthat everyone who reads his pages will feel that henceforth he knows the\r\nSea Dyak of Sarawak better than he ever knew him before, and will come to\r\nthe conclusion that, in spite of his faults, he is a very likeable man.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks, then, are worth knowing. They constitute a very valuable\r\nelement in the population of Sarawak, not only from their numbers, but\r\nalso from their force of character. They are active, hardworking,\r\nindustrious, ready to earn an honest penny when they have the chance; and\r\nin their domestic relations are amiable and hospitable towards strangers,\r\nand when treated with civility and sympathy, all their good points come\r\nto the surface. They work hard at rice-planting, which, it is true, is\r\nof a very primitive sort, but it is the best they know, and as good\r\nas that practised by their Mohammedan neighbours, the Malays. If some\r\nsimple system of irrigation could be introduced among them, especially\r\nin lowland cultivation, this, their main industry, would be far more\r\nproductive than it is, and it would be a real boon to the country at\r\nlarge. They have adventured upon the cultivation of other products when\r\nthe way has been made clear to them, which is an evidence of their\r\ncapacity for progress. They penetrate and traverse far-off jungles in\r\nsearch of indiarubber and gutta-percha to add to their earnings. An\r\nincreasing number of them are keen upon book-learning, as Mr. Gomes\r\npoints out. They form the Rajah’s soldiers and guards, and are capable\r\nof useful service in subordinate positions as officers. And thus these\r\npeople, who were once only known as fighters, pirates, and head-takers,\r\nare now a real influence in the evolution of a better civilization and a\r\nmore fruitful era to come in those lands. The civilizing, Christianizing\r\nforce no doubt works slowly; but there it is, and, comparing present with\r\npast, we can see it. A large influx of white people of the usual colonist\r\nclass would doubtless be too strong for them, and would push them out of\r\nthe way; but with a favourable chance, which they now have, of working\r\nout a salvation for themselves, I think the Sea Dyaks have a better\r\nfuture before them than Mr. Gomes appears to anticipate.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to watch the process of a gradual enlightening going\r\non among such a race when brought into contact with higher civilization\r\nand better religion. Mr. Gomes mentions some instances of its expression.\r\nPerhaps I may add an illustrative instance which occurred in my own\r\nexperiences, many years ago. One night I was at anchor with a Dyak crew\r\non the Saribas River, waiting for the turn of the tide. About 3 a.m. I\r\nwas awakened by a frightened cry from one of the crew: “Antu! antu!”\r\n(A spirit, a spirit!). Thinking myself lucky at last in a chance of\r\nactually seeing one of those invisible beings whom Dyaks dread so much,\r\nI pushed my head from under the mosquito-curtain, and looked out, and\r\nbeheld a comet brightly shining not far above the horizon. Presently I\r\nheard a school-lad say: “That’s not a spirit; it’s only a star with a\r\ntail. I have learnt about it.” There was the old superstition and the\r\nnew knowledge struggling together, a symbol of what is going on in other\r\ndepartments of Dyak thought and belief—the working of that which, it is\r\nto be hoped, will issue in a higher and an improved life for the race.\r\nOur Author’s book will evoke a lively interest in such an improvement\r\nin Dyakland, and will inspire a deeper sympathy with every progressive\r\neffort towards it.\r\n\r\nIn going over Mr. Gomes’s pages my thoughts have often gone back to days,\r\nnow long past, when he and I were workers together among the people of\r\nwhom he writes so sympathetically, and many a long-forgotten incident has\r\ncome back to mind; and it is a pleasure to write a simple word of welcome\r\nto this product of his pen, and to express a conviction that his book is\r\njust what was wanted to give the public a clear and adequate conception\r\nof one of the leading races which have been ruled over by the “Two White\r\nRajahs” of Sarawak.\r\n\r\n                                                             JOHN PERHAM.\r\n\r\nCHARD, _December, 1910_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to express my thanks to Sir Clement Kinloch-Cooke, M.P., for\r\nthe preface which he has kindly contributed to this volume, and for\r\nallowing me to reproduce my translations of Sea Dyak legends which\r\nappeared in the _Empire Review_; to Bishop Hose, under whom I worked for\r\nseventeen years among the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak, for allowing me to use\r\nhis excellent article on “The Contents of a Dyak Medicine-chest”; to the\r\nRev. John Perham, formerly Archdeacon of Singapore, with whom I worked\r\nin Sarawak for some years, for his introduction, and also for allowing\r\nme to make use of the scholarly papers which he wrote for the _Journal\r\nof the Straits Branch of the Asiatic Society_, on Sea Dyak Religion and\r\nFolklore; and to the Rev. David Steele-Morris for going through the\r\nmanuscript and making many useful suggestions.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak for permission to\r\ninsert his portrait; to Dr. Charles Hose for his great kindness in\r\nallowing me to use his excellent photographs, and also to the Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for lending me one\r\nof their blocks; to Messrs. Bassano, of Bond Street, and Messrs. G. R.\r\nLambert and Co., of Singapore, whose photographs I am kindly permitted\r\nto reproduce; to Mr. Hewitt, formerly curator of the Sarawak Museum; and\r\nMr. Ha Buey Hon, of Kuching, who have also been so good as to lend me\r\nphotographs.\r\n\r\nTo all these, as well as to many unmentioned friends who have helped me\r\nto write this book, I offer my sincere thanks.\r\n\r\n                                                          EDWIN H.

gigantic\r\ntrees, in the midst of which are mountains clothed in evergreen foliage,\r\ntheir barren cliffs buried beneath a network of creepers and ferns. The\r\nstriking features are the size of the enormous forest trees and the\r\ncloseness of their growth, rather than their loveliness or brilliancy\r\nof colour. In the tropical forests few bright-coloured flowers relieve\r\nthe monotony of dark green leaves and dark brown trunks and branches\r\nof trees. The prevailing hue of tropical plants is a sombre green. The\r\ngreater and lesser trees are often loaded with trailers and ferns,\r\namong which huge masses of the elk-horn fern are often conspicuous.\r\nBut there is little colour to relieve the monotony of all these sombre\r\nhues. Here and there may be seen some creeper with red berries, and many\r\nbright-coloured orchids hang high overhead. But it is impossible for the\r\nobserver to gain a favourable position for beholding the richest blooms,\r\nwhich often climb far above him, turning their faces towards the sunlight\r\nabove the roof of foliage.\r\n\r\nThese regions are still inhabited by half-clad men and women, living\r\nquaint lives in their strange houses, observing weird ceremonies, and\r\ncherishing strange superstitions and curious customs, delighting in games\r\nand feasts, and repeating ancient legends of their gods and heroes. But\r\nin a few years all these things will be forgotten; for in Borneo, as\r\nelsewhere, civilization is coming—coming quickly—and all the distinctive\r\nDyak customs will soon be things of the past. Already the Dyak is mixing\r\nwith other races in the towns, and is changing his picturesque dress for\r\nWestern costume. He is fast forgetting his old practices and his old\r\nmodes of thought.\r\n\r\nThe tropical forests of Sarawak were much the same years ago as they are\r\nto-day. But the life of the Dyak is already greatly changed, and his lot\r\nimproved by the introduction of just rule, law and order, and respect for\r\nhuman life. For a moment let us go back to the past, and try to picture\r\nthe life of the Sea Dyak as it was some sixty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was constant warfare between the different tribes,\r\nand the Dyaks lived together in large numbers in their long houses,\r\nwhich had stockades around them, so that they had some defence against\r\nany sudden attack. Very often the young braves would make an expedition\r\nagainst some neighbouring tribe, simply because they wanted to bring\r\nhome, each man of them, the ghastly trophy of a human head, and thus gain\r\nfavour in the eyes of the Dyak girls. In these expeditions many were\r\nkilled and many taken captive, to be the slaves of the conquerors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SEA DYAK WITH SHIELD\r\n\r\nHe is dressed in the usual waist-cloth the Dyaks wear. On his head is a\r\nheadkerchief decorated with a fringe. He wears a necklace of large silver\r\nbuttons. On his arms are sea-shell bracelets, and on his calves a large\r\nnumber of palm fibre rings. His right hand is holding the handle of his\r\nsword, the sheath of which is fastened to his belt, and his left hand is\r\non his shield. The shield is made out of one piece of wood and coloured\r\nwith a fanciful design. It is decorated with human hair from the head of\r\ndead enemies.]\r\n\r\nOften in those days a party of Dyaks would suddenly attack some\r\nneighbouring house. Such of the men as were at home would repel the\r\nattack as best they could, for defeat meant certain death, if not worse.\r\nThe women and children—such of them as had not managed to escape and\r\nhide in the jungle—would be crowded together in the veranda of the Dyak\r\nhouse, and the men, armed with sword and spear and shield, would form a\r\ncircle round them. The large brass gongs (_tawak_) would be struck in a\r\npeculiar manner, to let the neighbours know of the attack, and to implore\r\ntheir help. The fight would continue till one party was defeated. If any\r\ncame to the rescue, the attacking party would retreat, pursued by such of\r\nthe inmates of the house as dared to follow them; but if no help came,\r\nthe house would be rushed, the men and women cut down, and the children\r\nkilled or taken captive. The heads of the dead would be cut off amid wild\r\nwhoops of joy, and carried off in triumph.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to Dyaks who have been present at such scenes, and asked\r\nthem to describe to me what happens on such occasions. What they had to\r\nsay was horrible enough to listen to, but what must the reality have been!\r\n\r\nSometimes the victims would be attacked when at work on their farms, or\r\nsome solitary farm-hut would be surrounded at night. In each case the\r\nenemy would meet with little resistance. Thus the Dyaks used to live in a\r\nconstant state of fear.\r\n\r\nIn those days many of the Sea Dyaks joined the Malays in their piratical\r\nattacks upon trading boats. It was the practice of the Malay pirates and\r\ntheir Dyak allies to wreck and destroy every vessel that came near their\r\nshores, to murder most of the crew who offered any resistance, and to\r\nmake slaves of the rest. The Malay fleet consisted of a large number of\r\nlong war-boats, or _prahus_, each about ninety or more feet long, and\r\ncarrying a brass gun in the bows, the pirates being armed with swords\r\nand spears and muskets. Each boat was paddled by from sixty to eighty\r\nmen. These terrible craft skulked about in the sheltered coves waiting\r\nfor their prey, and attacked merchant-vessels making the passage between\r\nChina and Singapore. These piratical raids were often made with the\r\nsecret sanction of the native rulers, who obtained a share of the spoil\r\nas the price of their connivance.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks of Saribas and Skrang and the Balaus gladly joined the Malays\r\nin these expeditions, not only for the sake of obtaining booty, but\r\nbecause they could thus indulge in their favourite pursuit, and gain\r\nglory for themselves by bringing home human heads to decorate their\r\nhouses with. The Dyak _bangkongs_ were long boats capable of holding as\r\nmany as eighty men. They often had a flat roof, from which the warriors\r\nfought, while their comrades paddled below.\r\n\r\nBoth the piracy and the terrible custom of head-hunting were put down by\r\nSir James Brooke. The romantic story of how he came to be the first Rajah\r\nof Sarawak may here be briefly recalled.\r\n\r\nJames Brooke was born on April 29, 1803. His father was a member of the\r\nCivil Service of the East India Company, and spent a great many years\r\nin India. Following in his father’s footsteps, he entered the Company’s\r\nservice, and was sent out to India in 1825. Not long after his arrival\r\nhe was put in command of a regiment of soldiers, and ordered to Burmah,\r\nwhere he took part in the Burmese War; and, being dangerously wounded in\r\nan engagement, was compelled to return home on furlough. For over four\r\nyears his health prevented him from rejoining his regiment, and when at\r\nlast he started, the voyage out was so protracted, through a shipwreck\r\nand other misfortunes, that his furlough had expired before he was able\r\nto reach his destination. His appointment consequently lapsed, and he\r\nquitted the service in 1830.\r\n\r\nIn that same year he made a voyage to China, and was struck by the\r\nnatural beauty and fertility of the islands of the Indian Archipelago,\r\nand horrified with the savagery of the tribes inhabiting them, who were\r\ncontinually at war with one another, and engaged in a monstrous system of\r\npiracy. He conceived the grand idea of rescuing them from barbarism, and\r\nof extirpating piracy in the Eastern Archipelago.\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father he inherited the sum of £30,000, and found\r\nhimself in a position to carry out his schemes. He bought and equipped a\r\nyacht, the _Royalist_, and for three years he cruised about, chiefly in\r\nthe Mediterranean, training his crew of twenty men for the arduous work\r\nthat lay before them.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1838, he sailed from the Thames on his great adventure,\r\ntravelled slowly on the long journey round the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\narrived in Singapore in 1839. Here he met a shipwrecked crew, who had\r\nlately come from Borneo. They said they had been kindly treated by Muda\r\nHassim—a native Rajah in Borneo—and they asked Mr. James Brooke to take\r\npresents and letters of thanks to him, if he should be going thither\r\nin his yacht. Mr. Brooke had not decided which of the many islands\r\nof the Eastern Archipelago he would visit, and he was as ready to go\r\nto Borneo as to any other; so, setting sail, he made his way up the\r\nSarawak River, and anchored off Kuching on August 15, 1839. The country\r\nwas nominally under the rule of the Sultan of Brunei, but his uncle,\r\nRajah Muda Hassim, was then the greatest power in the island. As he\r\nwas favourable to English strangers, Mr. Brooke paid him the customary\r\nhomage, and was favourably received, and given full licence to visit the\r\nDyaks of Lundu. The Rajah was at this time engaged in war with several\r\nfierce Dyak tribes in the province of Sarawak, who had revolted against\r\nthe Sultan; but his efforts to quell this rebellion were ineffectual.\r\nThe absolute worthlessness of the native troops under his command, and\r\nhis own weakness of character, induced him to cling to Mr. Brooke, in\r\nwhom he recognized a born leader of men, and he appealed for his help in\r\nputting down the insurgents, and implored him not to leave him a prey to\r\nhis enemies. The Rajah even offered to transfer the government of the\r\nprovince to Brooke if he would remain and take command. This offer he\r\nfelt bound at the time to decline, but it led to his obtaining a position\r\nof authority at Sarawak, useful for the purposes of trade.\r\n\r\nWith James Brooke’s help the rebellion, which the Malay forces were too\r\nfeeble to subdue, was effectually stayed. The insurgents were defeated\r\nin a battle in which Brooke, with the crew of his yacht and some Malay\r\nfollowers, took part. For his services on this occasion Muda Hassim\r\nconferred on him the title of Rajah of Sarawak, and this was the first\r\nstep towards that larger sovereignty which he afterwards acquired. Some\r\ntime elapsed, however, before the Sultan of Brunei could be induced to\r\nconfirm the title. Mr. Brooke at once took vigorous action, making many\r\nreforms and introducing a system of administration far superior to any\r\nthat the native authorities had ever dreamed of; and in September, 1841,\r\nthe government of Sarawak and its dependencies was formally made over to\r\nhim. In the following year the Sultan of Brunei confirmed what Rajah Muda\r\nHassim had done, on the condition that the religion of the Mohammedans of\r\nthe country should be respected.\r\n\r\nAnd now Rajah Brooke found himself in a position of authority which\r\nenabled him to bring all his administrative powers into operation. He\r\nsaw clearly that the development of commerce would be the most effective\r\nmeans of civilizing the natives, and to make this possible it was\r\nnecessary to suppress the hideous piracy which was not only a curse to\r\nthe savage tribes, appealing as it did to their worst instincts, but a\r\nstanding danger to both European and native traders in those seas.\r\n\r\nIn the suppression of piracy James Brooke found a vigorous ally in\r\nCaptain (afterwards Admiral) Keppel, who, in command of H.M.S. _Dido_,\r\nwas summoned from the China station in 1843 for this service. Various\r\nexpeditions were organized and sent out against the marauders, the story\r\nof which has been told by himself. The pirates were attacked in their\r\nstrongholds by Captain Keppel and other commanders of British ships. They\r\nfought desperately, and the slaughter was immense. The pirate crews found\r\nthe entrances to the rivers blocked up by English gunboats, and their\r\nretreat cut off. These strenuous measures soon cleared the seas.\r\n\r\nThe practice of head-hunting was also dealt with by Sir James Brooke.\r\nHe declared it to be a crime punishable with death, and by his rigorous\r\ntreatment of head-hunting parties he gave the deathblow to this horrible\r\nnational custom.\r\n\r\nAfter his strenuous life in Sarawak, Sir James Brooke had a great desire\r\nto visit England. Besides other reasons, the wish to see his relatives\r\nand friends, he felt he could effect more for the inhabitants of Borneo\r\nby a personal interview with Government Ministers in England than by\r\ncorrespondence. He left Sarawak, and reached England early in October,\r\n1847. There honours awaited him. He was presented with the freedom of\r\nthe City of London; Oxford University conferred upon him the degree of\r\nLL.D.; he was graciously received at Windsor by the Queen and the Prince\r\nConsort. The British Government recognized the work he had done, and\r\nappointed him Governor of Labuan and Commissioner and Consul-General in\r\nBorneo, and made him a K.C.B. The warrant of investiture was issued by\r\nHer Majesty on May 22, 1848.\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of piracy was the first step towards introducing into the\r\ncountry the blessings of a settled government, with all its civilizing\r\ninfluences. But he was not satisfied with this, and soon began to take\r\nmeasures for the establishment of a Christian Mission in Sarawak. When\r\nSir James Brooke visited England in 1847, he appealed to the Church,\r\nand especially to the two Universities, to come to his aid. Neither of\r\nthe two great missionary societies was able at the time to undertake\r\nthis new enterprise through lack of funds, and a new organization, the\r\n“Borneo Church Mission,” was founded, which laboured in the island for a\r\nfew years. Then, in 1854, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\nin Foreign Parts was able to take up the work, and has ever since been\r\nresponsible for it. The original organization had, however, done well in\r\nthe choice of the missionaries it sent out, the first of whom was the\r\nRev. F. T. McDougall, who was consecrated Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak\r\nin 1855.\r\n\r\nMy father, the Rev. W. H. Gomes, B.D., worked under Bishop McDougall as\r\na missionary among the Dyaks of Lundu from 1852 to 1867, and I myself\r\nhave worked, under Bishop Hose, as a missionary in Sarawak, for seventeen\r\nyears, and have thus gained an intimate knowledge of the people and of\r\ntheir lives, now so rapidly changing under Western influence.\r\n\r\nSir James Brooke was a man of the highest personal character. That a\r\nyoung English officer, with a fortune of his own, should have been\r\nwilling to devote his whole life to improving the condition of the Dyaks\r\nwas a grand thing. That he should have been able, by perfectly legitimate\r\nmeans, to do this in the teeth of much official and other opposition;\r\nthat he should have been able to put down piracy and head-hunting, with\r\ntheir unspeakable accompaniments of misery and cruelty, and to do it all\r\nwith the hearty good-will of the people under his rule,—this was indeed\r\nan achievement which might have seemed hardly possible.\r\n\r\nThe present Rajah of Sarawak, Sir Charles Brooke, is a nephew of the\r\nfirst Rajah. He joined his uncle in 1852, when he held the rank of\r\nlieutenant in the British navy. For ten years he played an important\r\npart in the arduous work of punishing rebels and establishing a sound\r\ngovernment. In 1857, when the Chinese insurrection broke out, it\r\nwas his action that led to the punishment of the insurgents and the\r\nrestoration of peace. In 1863, on the retirement of the first Rajah, he\r\nassumed control of the country, and five years later, on the death of\r\nhis predecessor, he became Rajah of Sarawak. Ever since he became the\r\nresponsible ruler of the country, Sarawak has advanced steadily, and\r\nmade great moral and material progress. To the general public the first\r\nRajah will always appear the romantic, heroic figure; but, while yielding\r\nfull measure of praise and admiration to the work of a great man, those\r\nwho know the country will, I think, agree with me that the heavier\r\nburden of working steadily and unwearyingly, when the romance of novelty\r\nhad worn off, has been borne by his successor. With talents not less\r\nthan those of his illustrious uncle he has carried out, in the face of\r\ndisappointments and the most serious obstacles, a policy of regeneration\r\nfor which the striking exploits of Sir James Brooke merely paved the way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo. Bassano_\r\n\r\nSIR CHARLES BROOKE, G.C.M.G., THE PRESENT RAJAH OF SARAWAK]\r\n\r\nHis work is well summarized by himself in an address to the _Kunsil\r\nNegri_ (the Council of the Country) in 1891. He said he might divide\r\nhis term of service of thirty-nine years into three periods of thirteen\r\nyears each. The first period had been almost wholly spent in the work\r\nof suppressing head-hunting among the Dyaks. It involved frequent\r\nexpeditions against rebellious Dyaks, much hard travelling by river and\r\nby land, and a constant watch against subtle enemies. The second period\r\nhad been divided between occasional expeditions of the same nature and\r\nthe establishment of trade and peaceful pursuits, and the giving and\r\namending of laws as need arose. The last period had almost entirely been\r\ntaken up with attending to the political and social affairs of a settled\r\nand peaceful community. Those present, who had been young with himself in\r\nthe early days of his service, had been of great assistance to him, and\r\nhad carried through the work set them, rough and perilous in the extreme,\r\nin mountainous region of jungle, and on treacherous, rapid-flowing\r\nrivers, subject to every kind of exposure; but now these hardships were\r\nno more required, and that was well, for both they and himself were\r\ngrowing old. The character of his task and theirs was changed: he and\r\nhis old comrades, who had faced so many dangers together on river and\r\nin jungle, could now sit down comfortably and attend to the political\r\nbusiness and the commercial progress of the country.\r\n\r\nTo these three periods the Rajah has since added a fourth, and that\r\nthe longest of all, during which, as occasion served, a great deal has\r\nbeen done to extinguish the lingering sparks of intertribal hostility.\r\nThere are occasional outbreaks among the Dyaks of the interior, and\r\nhead-hunting still survives where natives think there is a chance of\r\nescaping detection and consequent punishment. But, happily, these are\r\ngetting more and more rare, and do not affect the prosperity or trade of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe method employed by the present Rajah to suppress head-hunting is best\r\ndescribed in his own words:\r\n\r\n“As soon as ever one of these parties started, or even listened to birds\r\nof omen preparatory to moving, a party was immediately despatched by\r\nGovernment to endeavour to cut them off, and to fine them heavily on\r\ntheir return; or, in the event of their bringing heads, to demand the\r\ndelivery up of them, and the payment of a fine into the bargain. This was\r\nthe steady and unflinching work of years, but before many months were\r\nover my stock of heads became numerous, and the fines considerable. Some\r\nrefused to pay or follow the directions of the Government. These were\r\ndeclared enemies, and had their houses burnt down forthwith, and the\r\npeople who followed me to do the work would be the Dyaks of some other\r\nbranch-tribe on the same river.”\r\n\r\nThe natives of Sarawak owe much to the Brookes. The work, nobly begun by\r\nSir James Brooke, has been ably carried on by the present Rajah. To use\r\nhis own words: “He as founder, and myself as builder, of the State have\r\nbeen one in our policy throughout, from the beginning up to the present\r\ntime; and now shortly I have to hand it to my son, and I hope that his\r\npolicy may not be far removed from that of his predecessors.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE DYAKS\r\n\r\n    The word “Dyak”—Other native races in Sarawak—_Milanaus_—\r\n    _Kayans_—_Kinyehs_—Cruelty—_Ukits_—_Bukitans_—_Punans_—\r\n    _Seru_—Sea Dyaks—Land Dyaks—The appearance of the Sea\r\n    Dyak—Men’s dress—Tattooing—Women’s dress-_Rawai_, or\r\n    corset—The teeth—Depilation—Language.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word “Dyak” is uncertain. Some think it is\r\nderived from _daya_, which in the Brunei Malay dialect means “inland,”\r\n“interior.” Others derive it from the Land Dyak word _daya_, which means\r\n“a man.” Whatever may be the derivation, it is quite incorrect to apply\r\nit to all the inland races of Borneo. There are many tribes, such as the\r\n_Kayans_, _Muruts_, _Ukits_, and _Punans_, who are not Dyaks at all,\r\ntheir language, customs, and traditions being quite different.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the Dyaks, some mention must be made of the other\r\nnative races to be found in Sarawak. They are the _Milanaus_, _Kayans_,\r\n_Kinyehs_, _Muruts_, _Ukits_, _Bukitans_, _Punans_, and _Seru_.\r\n\r\nThe _Milanaus_ are a quiet people who keep very much to themselves. They\r\nare not Mohammedans, although they dress like the Malays. They are an\r\nimportant tribe, and are to be found in large numbers at Matu, Oya, Muka,\r\nand Bintulu. They plant paddy and cultivate sago on a large scale. They\r\nare skilled in working iron, and are excellent boat-builders. Their\r\nspeech is somewhat similar to that of the Kayans, and many of their\r\ncustoms are alike.\r\n\r\nThe _Kayans_ and _Kinyehs_, who may be classed together, are a numerous\r\nrace inhabiting the upper waters of the Baram and Rejang Rivers. In many\r\nways they seem to be a more advanced race than the Sea Dyaks. They build\r\nbetter houses, and are more expert in the manufacture of weapons, being\r\nable to extract their iron from the native ore. Their moral character,\r\nhowever, is vindictive and cruel, and they are lacking in that spirit of\r\nhospitality which is such a great feature of the Sea Dyak character. A\r\nfew years ago a party of Dyak gutta-percha collectors were attacked by\r\nthe Punans, and many of them killed. Four young Dyaks managed to escape,\r\nand after wandering for many days in the jungle, arrived destitute and\r\nstarving at a Kayan house, and asked for food and shelter. The treatment\r\nthey received was horrible in the extreme. The Kayans bound the young\r\nmen, and after breaking their arms and legs, handed them over to the\r\nwomen, who slowly despatched them by hacking them to pieces with little\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nThe _Muruts_ inhabit the Limbang and Trusan Rivers. Their language and\r\ncustoms differ entirely from those of the Sea Dyaks.\r\n\r\nThe _Ukits_, _Bukitans_ (name probably derived from Malay _bukit_, “a\r\nhill”), and _Punans_ are races which inhabit the far interior, and lead a\r\nwandering life in the Kayan country. They do not build houses, but only\r\nmake temporary shelters for themselves between the buttresses of large\r\nforest trees. They live by hunting, and are expert in the use of the\r\n_sumpit_, or blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nThe _Seru_ are a small and fast dying out race. There used to be a\r\nlittle village of the Seru near my house in Kalaka, where some forty of\r\nthem lived in a long house, similar to that built by the Dyaks. The men\r\nwore the Dyak dress, but the women were dressed like the Malays, and wore\r\na long petticoat reaching to the ankles (_sarong_), and a long jacket\r\n(_kabayah_). They planted paddy, but did not depend entirely on this for\r\ntheir livelihood. The men were great hunters, and would salt and sell\r\nthe wild pig they killed. They were a very secluded people, and kept\r\nvery much to themselves. They were not Mohammedans, and did not seem to\r\nhave any of the religious rites peculiar to the Dyaks. They told me they\r\nbelieved in a good Spirit and a bad one, but their religious ideas were\r\nvery vague.\r\n\r\nBesides the tribes already mentioned, there are two distinct races of\r\nDyaks in Borneo—the Sea Dyaks and the Land Dyaks. The former live by the\r\nsea and on the banks of the rivers, though many of them may be found far\r\ninland. The Land Dyaks inhabit the interior of the country, and are not\r\nso numerous or energetic as the Sea Dyaks. The language and traditions of\r\nthese two divisions of the Dyak race are quite distinct.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks spoken of in this work are the Sea Dyaks. Their home is in\r\nSarawak—the country governed by Rajah Brooke—though they often travel far\r\nafield, and they are to be found in large numbers on the banks of the\r\nrivers of Sarawak—the Batang, Lupar, Saribas, Krian, and Rejang.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is of rather greater stature than that of the Malay, though\r\nhe is considerably shorter than the average European. The men are\r\nwell-proportioned, but slightly built. Their form suggests activity,\r\nspeed, and endurance rather than great strength, and these are the\r\nqualities most required by dwellers in the jungle. Their movements are\r\neasy and graceful, and their carriage erect. The women are generally\r\nsmaller than the men. They have neat figures, and are bright, cheerful,\r\nand good-looking in their youth, but they age very soon.\r\n\r\nThe colour of their skin varies considerably, not so much between one\r\ntribe and another as in different parts of the country. Generally\r\nspeaking, those who reside in the interior of the country, on the banks\r\nof the upper reaches of the rivers, are fairer than those who live nearer\r\nthe sea. This may be due to the deeper shade afforded by old jungle, and\r\nthe bathing in and drinking of the water of the clear, gravel-bedded\r\nstreams. Their colour varies from a dark bronze to a light brown, with a\r\ntinge of yellow. Their eyes are black or dark brown, clear and bright,\r\nwith quick intelligence and good temper. Their mouths are generally\r\nill-shapen and disfigured by excessive chewing of _sireh_ and betel-nut,\r\na habit much indulged in by both men and women.\r\n\r\nIn dress great alterations have resulted from foreign influence, and the\r\nDyaks who live near the towns wear the trousers and coat of civilized\r\nraces, but the original style still prevails in the up-country villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE TYPICAL DYAKS\r\n\r\nThe man on the right is using a seat mat made of the skin of an animal.\r\nSometimes these mats are made of split cane. The Dyak, in his wanderings\r\nin the jungle, has often to sit on prickly grass or sharp stones, and a\r\nseat mat is a useful part of his attire.]\r\n\r\nLove of finery is inherent in the young Dyak. The old men are often\r\nvery shabbily dressed, but the young are more particular. The ordinary\r\nmale attire consists of a _sirat_, or waist-cloth, a _labong_, or\r\nheadkerchief, and a _tikai buret_, or seat-mat. The waist-cloth is made\r\nof the soft inner bark of a tree, or more frequently of some red or blue\r\ncotton cloth. This is one yard wide, and from eight to eighteen feet\r\nlong, and is twisted round and round their waists, and pulled up tight\r\nbetween the thighs, one end hanging down in front and the other behind.\r\nSometimes this waist-cloth is woven by the Dyak women, and then the end\r\nthat hangs down in front has an elaborate pattern woven into it. Their\r\nhead-dress is either a bright-coloured headkerchief, or else a small cap\r\nof woven cane, in which feathers and other ornaments are often stuck. The\r\n_tikai buret_, or seat-mat, is made either of the skin of some animal or\r\nof cane matting. Its edges are decorated with red and white cloth, and\r\nwith beads or buttons.\r\n\r\nBesides these articles of apparel the men sometimes wear a sleeveless\r\njacket, or _klambi_. These are often woven by the Dyak women, either\r\nfrom yarn spun from cotton of their own growing or from imported yarn of\r\na finer texture. More often in the present day they are made of cloth\r\nof European manufacture. The patterns of the Dyak-woven _klambi_ are\r\nvarious, but those of a particular type can only be worn by men who have\r\nsucceeded in securing a human head when on the warpath. The lower edge of\r\nthis jacket is ornamented with beads, shells, and buttons, and bordered\r\nby a fringe.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the attire already mentioned, the men have sometimes a\r\n_dandong_, or shawl, which is thrown over the shoulders. The ornaments\r\nworn on the arms and legs are brass rings, which vary among the Dyaks of\r\ndifferent districts. Armlets made from sea-shells are very much in favour\r\namong some inland tribes. The young men generally wear their hair long,\r\ncut in a fringe in front, and either hanging down loose behind, or tucked\r\ninto their caps.\r\n\r\nTattooing is practised by most of the Dyaks in a greater or less degree.\r\nIt is confined to the male sex, who often have little patterns tattooed\r\non the forehead, throat-apple, shoulders, or chest.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the women consists of a petticoat (_kain_), drawn tightly\r\nround the waist and reaching to the knee, and in addition a _klambi_,\r\nor jacket, worn when out of doors. For ornaments the women wear\r\nfinger-rings, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, and often a girdle\r\nformed of silver coins, or of silver or brass chain. Round the stomach\r\nare wound long strips of coloured cane. Among some tribes a peculiar\r\ncorset, called the rawai, is worn by the women. This is made of small\r\nbrass rings strung closely together on hoops of rattan, which are\r\nconnected with one another inside by a network of cane. A few of these\r\nhoops are made larger so as to hang loose over the hips. The series that\r\nencase the waist, stomach, and chest fit very close. This corset must\r\nbe very uncomfortable, as the wearer can hardly bend the body at all,\r\nespecially when it is worn right up to and covering the breasts, as it is\r\ndone by some young women who can afford such extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe hair is worn long, and tied in a knot at the back of the head. Some\r\nof the women have beautiful raven black hair of great length. Wavy or\r\ncurly hair is seldom seen.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are often blackened, as black teeth are considered a sign of\r\nbeauty. The blackening is done by taking a piece of old cocoanut-shell or\r\nof certain woods, and holding it over a hot fire until a black resinous\r\njuice exudes. This juice is collected, and while still warm the teeth are\r\ncoated with it. The front teeth are also frequently filed to a point,\r\nand this gives their face a curious dog-like appearance. Sometimes the\r\nteeth are filed concavely in front, or else the front teeth are filed\r\ndown till almost level with the gums. Another curious way of treating the\r\nfront teeth is to drill a hole in the middle of each tooth, and fix in\r\nit a brass stud. I was once present when this operation was in progress.\r\nThe man lay down with a piece of soft wood between his teeth, and the\r\n“dentist” bored a hole in one of his front teeth. The agony the patient\r\nendured must have been very great, judging by the look on his face and\r\nhis occasional bodily contortions. The next thing was to insert the\r\nend of a pointed brass wire, which was then filed off, leaving a short\r\npiece in the tooth; a small hammer was used to fix this in tightly, and,\r\nlastly, a little more filing was done to smooth the surface of the brass\r\nstud. I am told the process is so painful that it is not often a man can\r\nbear to have more than one or two teeth operated on at a time.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks do not like beards, and much prefer a smooth face. In the whole\r\ncourse of my Dyak experience I have only met with one bearded man. The\r\nuniversal absence of hair upon the face, on the chest, and under the\r\narm-pits might lead one to suppose that it was a natural deficiency.\r\nBut this is not the case at all, as old men and chronic invalids, who\r\nby reason of age or infirmity have ceased to care about their personal\r\nappearance, have often chins covered with a bristly growth. The absence\r\nof hair on the face and elsewhere is due to systematic depilation. The\r\nlooking-glass and tweezers are often seen in the hands of the young men,\r\nand they devote every spare moment to the plucking out of stray hairs.\r\n_Kapu_, or quicklime, which is one of the constituents of betel-nut\r\nmixture chewed by the Dyaks, is often rubbed into the skin to destroy the\r\nvitality of the hair-follicles.\r\n\r\nAmong some tribes it is the fashion for both men and women to shave\r\nthe eyebrows and pull out the eyelashes, and this gives their faces a\r\nstaring, vacant expression. I have often tried to convince them of the\r\nfoolishness of trying to improve upon nature in this way, and pointed out\r\nthat both eyebrows and eyelashes are a protection to the eyes from dust\r\nand glare. But my remarks have made little impression on them. Among the\r\nDyaks, as elsewhere, fashions die hard.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyak language is practically a dialect of Malay which is spoken\r\nmore or less over all Polynesia. It is not nearly so copious as other\r\nMalayan languages, but the Dyaks do not scruple to use Malay words in\r\ntheir conversation when necessary. The Dyak language is particularly\r\nweak in expressing abstract ideas. What the mind cannot grasp the tongue\r\nis not likely to express. I believe there is only one word—_rindu_—to\r\nexpress all the different varieties of love. On the other hand, the\r\nlanguage is rich in words expressing the common actions of daily life.\r\nThere are many words to express the different ways of carrying anything;\r\none word for carrying in the hand, another for carrying on the back, and\r\nanother for carrying on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThere are several words in Dyak which resemble Malay words of the same\r\nmeaning, the difference being that the Malay suffix _an_ is changed into\r\n_ai_. Thus, the Malay word _makan_ (to eat) becomes _makai_ in Dyak, and\r\n_jalan_ (to walk) becomes _jalai_. There are some words exactly the same\r\nin both languages, and these are for the most part simple substantives,\r\nsuch as _rumah_ (house), _laki_ (husband), _bini_ (wife). Verbs, however,\r\ncommonly differ, though expressing simple necessary actions. Thus, the\r\nMalay word for “to drink” is _minum_, the Dyak word is _ngirup_; the\r\nMalay for “to eat” is _makan_, and the Dyak _empa_ as well as _makai_.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that there should be many words in Dyak not known to\r\nthe Malays. Though derived from the same parent tongue, the Dyak language\r\nhas developed independently by contact with other races.\r\n\r\nThere are many tribes that talk the Sea Dyak language. The Sabuyaus\r\nliving on the coast and at Lundu, the Balaus of the Batang Lupar and\r\nelsewhere, the dwellers on the Skrang and Saribas Rivers, as well as the\r\nKanowit and Katibas branches of the Rejang River, all speak it, with\r\nslight modifications. There can be no doubt that all these tribes are\r\ndescended from the same parent stock.\r\n\r\nThe difference of dialect between the different tribes is often a source\r\nof great amusement, and I remember well taking some Saribas boys, who\r\nhad been some time in my school at Banting, on a visit to their people.\r\nWe sat in the long veranda of the Dyak house, and I noticed that as they\r\nspoke to their relatives and friends there were shrieks of laughter and\r\ngreat merriment. The reason of this was that the boys had unconsciously\r\npicked up the Balau dialect during their stay at Banting, and their\r\nmanner of speaking amused their Saribas friends exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMANNER OF LIFE\r\n\r\n    Dyak village house—_Tanju_—_Ruai_—_Bilik_—_Sadau_—Human\r\n    heads—Valuable jars—Paddy-planting—Men’s work—Women’s\r\n    work—House-building—Boat-building—_Kadjangs_—Dyak\r\n    tools—_Bliong_—_Duku_—Weaving—Plaiting mats and\r\n    basket-making—Hunting—Traps—Fishing—Spoon-bait—Casting-net—\r\n    _Tuba_-fishing—Crocodile-catching.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Dyaks a whole village, consisting of some twenty or thirty\r\nfamilies, or even more, live together under one roof. This village house\r\nis built on piles made of hard wood, which raise the floor from six to\r\ntwelve feet above the ground. The ascent is made by a notched trunk or\r\nlog, which serves as a ladder; one is fixed at each end of the house.\r\nThe length of this house varies according to the number of families\r\ninhabiting it; but as the rooms occupied by the different families are\r\nbuilt on the same plan and by a combination of labour, the whole presents\r\na uniform and regular appearance.\r\n\r\nThe roof and outside walls are thatched with the leaves of the _nipa_\r\npalm, which are first made into _attap_. These are made by doubling the\r\nleaves over a stick about six feet long, each leaf overlapping the other,\r\nand sewn down with split cane or reeds. These _attap_ are arranged in\r\nrows, each _attap_ overlapping the one beneath it, and thus forming a\r\nroof which keeps off the rain and sun, and lasts for three or four years.\r\n\r\nThe long Dyak village house is built in a straight line, and consists of\r\na long uncovered veranda, which is called the _tanju_. The paddy is put\r\non the _tanju_ to be dried by the sun before it is pounded to get rid of\r\nits husk and convert it into rice. Here also the clothes and a variety\r\nof other things are hung out to dry. The family whetstone and dye vat\r\nare kept under the eaves of the roof, and the men sharpen their tools\r\nand the women do their dyeing on the _tanju_. The flooring of this part\r\nof the house is generally made of _bilian_, or iron-wood, so as to stand\r\nexposure to the weather.\r\n\r\nNext to the _tanju_ comes the covered veranda, or _ruai_. This also\r\nstretches the whole length of the house, and the floor is made of bamboo,\r\nor _nibong_ (a kind of palm), split into laths and tied down with rattan\r\nor cane.\r\n\r\nThis _ruai_, or public hall, is generally about twenty feet wide, and\r\nas it stretches the whole length of the house without any partition, it\r\nis a cool and pleasant place, and is much frequented by men and women\r\nfor conversation and indoor pursuits. Here the women often do their\r\nwork—the weaving of cloth or the plaiting of mats. Here, too, the men\r\nchop up the firewood, or even make boats, if not of too great a size.\r\nThis long _ruai_ is a public place open to all comers, and used as a\r\nroad by travellers, who climb up the ladder at one end, walk through the\r\nwhole length of the house, and go down the ladder at the other end. The\r\nfloor is carpeted with thick and heavy mats, made of cane interlaced with\r\nnarrow strips of beaten bark. Over these are spread other mats of finer\r\ntexture for visitors to sit upon.\r\n\r\nThe length of this covered veranda depends upon the number of families\r\nliving in the house, and these range from three or four to forty or fifty.\r\n\r\nEach family has its own portion of this _ruai_, and in each there is a\r\nsmall fireplace, which consists of a slab of stone, at which the men warm\r\nthemselves, when they get up, as they usually do, in the chill of the\r\nearly morning before the sun has risen.\r\n\r\nOver this fireplace hangs the most valuable ornament in the eyes of the\r\nDyak, the bunch of human heads. These are the heads obtained when on the\r\nwarpath by various members of the family—dead and living—and are handed\r\ndown from father to son as the most precious heirlooms—more precious,\r\nindeed, than the ancient jars which the Dyaks prize so highly.\r\n\r\nThe posts in this public covered veranda are often adorned with the horns\r\nof deer and the tusks of wild boars—trophies of the chase. The empty\r\nsheaths of swords are suspended on these horns or from wooden hooks,\r\nwhile the naked blades are placed in racks overhead.\r\n\r\nOn one side of this long public hall is a row of doors. Each of these\r\nleads into a separate room, or _bilik_, which is occupied by a family.\r\nThe doors open outwards, and each is closed by means of a heavy weight\r\nsecured to a thong fastened to the inside. If the room be unusually\r\nlarge, it may have two doors for the sake of convenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK MAKING A BLOW-PIPE\r\n\r\nHe is seen here shaping the outside of the blow-pipe. The hole is bored\r\nwhile the wood is about six inches in diameter, and it is then pared down\r\nto about two inches.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK VILLAGE HOUSE IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThis picture shows the arrangement of pillars and rafters of a Dyak\r\nhouse. The floor nearest the earth is divided into the long open veranda\r\nand the rooms in which the different families live. Above this is the\r\nloft, where the paddy is stored away. Part of the roof in the picture has\r\nbeen covered with palm-leaf thatch.]\r\n\r\nThis room serves several purposes. It serves as a kitchen, and in one\r\ncorner there is a fireplace where the food is cooked. This fireplace is\r\nset against the wall of the veranda, and resembles an open cupboard. The\r\nlowest shelf rests on the floor, and is boarded all round and filled with\r\nclay. This forms the fireplace, and is furnished with a few stones upon\r\nwhich the pots are set for cooking. The shelf immediately above the\r\nfireplace is set apart for smoking fish. The shelves above are filled\r\nwith firewood, which is thoroughly dried by the smoke and ready for use.\r\nAs the smoke from the wood fire is not conducted through the roof by any\r\nkind of chimney, it spreads itself through the loft, and blackens the\r\nbeams and rafters of the roof.\r\n\r\nThis room also serves as a dining-room. When the food is cooked, mats are\r\nspread here, and the inmates squat on the floor to eat their meal. There\r\nis no furniture, the floor serving the double purpose of table and chairs.\r\n\r\nThis _bilik_ also serves as a bedroom. At night the mats for sleeping on\r\nare spread out here, and the mosquito-curtains hung up.\r\n\r\nThere is no window to let in the air and light, but a portion of the roof\r\nis so constructed that it can be raised a foot or two, and kept open by\r\nmeans of a stick.\r\n\r\nRound the three sides of this room are ranged the treasured valuables\r\nof the Dyaks—old jars, some of which are of great value, and brass\r\ngongs, and guns. Their cups and plates are hung up in rows flat against\r\nthe walls. The flooring is the same as that of the veranda, and is\r\nmade of split palm or bamboo tied down with cane. The floor is swept\r\nafter a fashion, the refuse falling through the flooring to the ground\r\nunderneath. But the room is stuffy, and not such a pleasant place as the\r\nopen veranda. The pigs and poultry occupy the waste space under the house.\r\n\r\nFrom the _bilik_ there is a ladder which leads to an upper room, or loft\r\n(_sadau_), where they keep their tools and store their paddy. If the\r\nfamily be a large one, the young unmarried girls sleep in this loft, the\r\nboys and young men sleeping outside in the veranda.\r\n\r\nBoth men and women are industrious and hard-working. With regard to the\r\npaddy-planting on the hills, the work is divided between the men and\r\nwomen in the following manner. The men cut down the jungle where the\r\npaddy is to be planted. When the timber and shrubs have been burnt, the\r\nmen and women plant the grain. The roots of the trees are left in the\r\nground. The men walk in front, with a long heavy staff in the right hand\r\nof each, and make holes in the ground about a foot apart. The women walk\r\nbehind them and throw a few grains of seed in each hole.\r\n\r\nWhen the paddy has grown a little, the ground has to be carefully weeded;\r\nthis work is done by the women. When the crop is ripe, both men and women\r\ndo the reaping. They walk between the rows of standing grain, and with\r\na sharp, oddly-shaped little knife they cut off the heads one by one,\r\nand place them in their baskets, which are tied in front of them. The\r\ncarrying home of the paddy thus reaped is mostly done by the men, who can\r\ncarry very heavy loads on their backs, though the women help in this to\r\nsome extent. The next thing is to separate the grain from the little tiny\r\nstems to which it is still attached. This is done by the men. The grain\r\nis put on a large square sieve of rattan fixed between four posts in the\r\nveranda of the Dyak house, and the men tread on it and press it through\r\nthe sieve. The paddy that falls through is taken and stored in the loft\r\nin large round bins made of bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK GIRLS POUNDING RICE\r\n\r\nAfter the paddy has been passed through the husking mill it is pounded\r\nout in wooden mortars. Here are two girls at work. Each has her right\r\nfoot in the upper part of the mortar to kick back any grains of paddy\r\nthat may be likely to fall out.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUSKING MILL (_Kisar_)\r\n\r\nAfter the paddy is dried and before it is pounded, it is generally passed\r\nthrough a husking mill made in two parts—the lower half having a stem in\r\nthe middle which fits into the upper part, which is hollow. The paddy\r\nis put into a cavity in the upper half, and a man or woman seizes the\r\nhandles and works the upper half to the right and left alternately. The\r\npaddy drips through on to the mat on which this husking mill is placed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRYING PADDY\r\n\r\nBefore it is possible to rid the paddy of its husk and convert it into\r\nrice, it has to be dried in the sun. Here a woman is seen spreading out\r\nthe paddy on a mat with her hands. She is on the outside veranda of the\r\nDyak house (_tanju_). The long pole over her head is used by her to drive\r\naway the fowls and birds who may come to eat the paddy put out to dry.]\r\n\r\nWhen rice is wanted for food, the paddy is dried, and then pounded by the\r\nwomen in wooden mortars, with pestles five feet long. As a rule two or\r\nthree women each use their pestles at one mortar, which is cut out of the\r\ntrunk of a tree. I have seen as many as six girls using their pestles in\r\nquick succession at one mortar. In this way the grain is freed from husk,\r\nand is made ready for food.\r\n\r\nEach family farms its own piece of land. Much of such work as cutting\r\ndown the jungle and planting is done by a combination of labour, several\r\nfamilies agreeing to work for each other in turn. By this means all the\r\nplanting on the land belonging to a particular family is done in one day,\r\nand all the grain ripens at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dyaks wish to abandon an old habitation in favour of a new one,\r\na general meeting of the inhabitants is held to consider the matter, and\r\nthe desirability of building a new house is fully discussed. Sometimes it\r\nhappens that some families do not agree with the wishes of the majority,\r\nand these families split off and join another house. If a move be decided\r\non, a few experienced men are deputed to choose a site, and to report on\r\nits adaptability. There are several matters to be taken into account. The\r\nsite must be for preference on rising ground, and be near a good supply\r\nof water. There must also be some jungle near, where the inmates can get\r\ntheir firewood, and there must be large tracts of land not far away where\r\nthey can plant their paddy.\r\n\r\nWhen the new house has to be built on the low-lying, marshy ground in\r\nthe lower reaches of the river, the choice is not difficult. All that is\r\nnecessary is to choose a part of the river where the current is not very\r\nstrong. But in the hill country it is not easy to find a site where the\r\nground is fairly level, and can accommodate a large house of thirty or\r\nforty families.\r\n\r\nBefore building on the chosen site the omen birds are consulted. If the\r\nomens be favourable, all the men and lads turn out immediately with axes\r\nand choppers to cut down the trees of the jungle, which are then left to\r\ndry. Another meeting is then held to decide who is to be the _tuai_, or\r\nheadman, of the new house, and to settle the size and the sequence of the\r\nrooms. The next move is to appoint a time for all the people to meet at\r\nthe site of the new village. The ground is then cleared. All the timber\r\nis carried off, as it is considered unfortunate to burn it. The ground is\r\nmeasured out for the different rooms belonging to the different families,\r\nand pegs are put in where the posts have to stand. A piece of bamboo is\r\nthen stuck in the ground, filled with water and covered with leaves. A\r\nspear and a shield are placed beside it, and the whole is surrounded by\r\na wooden rail. The rail is to prevent the bamboo from being upset by\r\nwild animals, and the weapons are to warn strangers not to touch it. A\r\nfew people remain to keep watch, and to make a great deal of noise with\r\nbrass gongs and drums to frighten away the evil spirits. If in the early\r\nmorning they find there is much evaporation, the place is considered\r\nunhealthy, and is abandoned. If all be well, the building of the house\r\nis begun. Each family must kill a fowl or a pig before the holes for the\r\nposts can be dug, and the blood must be smeared on the sharpened ends\r\nand sprinkled on the posts to propitiate Pulang Gana, the tutelary deity\r\nof the earth. They begin by making the holes for the headman’s quarters,\r\nand then work simultaneously to left and right of it. The posts, of which\r\nthere are a great number, are about twelve inches or less in diameter,\r\nand are of bilian or other hard wood so as not to rot in the earth. A\r\nhole four feet deep is made to receive each post. They must be planted\r\ncarefully and firmly, for if one were to give way subsequently it would\r\nbe regarded as foreboding evil, and the house would have to be abandoned\r\nand a new house built.\r\n\r\nAll the men combine to labour collectively until the skeleton of the\r\nhouse is complete, and then every family turns its attention to its own\r\napartments. During the building of the house, there is a great deal of\r\nstriking of gongs and other noisy instruments to prevent any birds of\r\nill omen being heard. I have sometimes argued with the Dyaks that if the\r\nwarnings of the birds are to be trusted, then why make so much noise to\r\nprevent hearing them? The Dyak’s reply to this was that as long as they\r\ndid not hear the warning, the spirits would not be displeased at their\r\nnot regarding it; so to spare themselves the trouble of choosing another\r\nsite and building another house, they make so much noise as to drown the\r\ncries of any birds.\r\n\r\nWhen the building is sufficiently advanced to receive the inmates, they\r\npack up their possessions and convey them to the house, halting on the\r\nway till they have heard some favourable omen, after which they proceed\r\njoyfully. Their belongings must not be moved into the house before\r\nthemselves, but must be taken with them when they move into the new house.\r\n\r\nHouse-building is considered the work of the men, and another important\r\nwork the men have to do is the making of boats. These are of all sizes,\r\nfrom the dug-out canoe twelve feet long to the long war-boat eighty to\r\nninety feet in length.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary boats of the Dyaks are cut out of a single log. Some of my\r\nschoolboys, under the guidance of the native schoolmaster, once made a\r\nsmall canoe for their own use, so I saw the whole process. A tree having\r\na round straight stem was felled, and the desired length of trunk cut\r\noff. The outside was then shaped with the adze to take the desired form\r\nof a canoe. Then the inside was hollowed out. The next thing to do was to\r\nwiden the inside of this canoe. This was done by filling the boat with\r\nwater and making a fire under it, and by fastening weights to each side.\r\nWhen the shell had been sufficiently opened out, thwarts were placed\r\ninside, about two feet from each other, to prevent the wood shrinking\r\nwhen the wood dried. The stem and stern of the canoe are alike, both\r\nbeing pointed and curved, and rising out of the water. The only tool used\r\nfor the making of a boat of this kind is the Dyak axe or adze (_bliong_).\r\n\r\nThis is the usual type of Dyak boat, and the method of making a smaller\r\nor larger canoe is exactly the same. Even a war-boat, ninety feet\r\nlong, is made from the trunk of one tree. In the longer boats planks\r\nor gunwales are stitched on the sides, and the seams are caulked so as\r\nto render the boat watertight. These boats are covered with awnings\r\ncalled _kadjangs_, which make a very good covering, as they are at\r\nonce watertight, very light, easily adjusted, and so flexible that if\r\nnecessary each section can be rolled up and stored in the bottom of\r\nthe boat. These _kadjangs_ are made of the young leaves of the _nipa_\r\npalm. The leaves are sewn together with split cane, each alternate leaf\r\noverlapping its neighbour on either side, until a piece about six and\r\na half feet square is made. This section is made to bend in the middle\r\ncrosswise, so that it can be doubled and rolled up, or partly opened, and\r\nmade to serve as a roof. Sometimes _kadjangs_ are made from the leaves of\r\nthe Pandanus palm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA DYAKS MAKING A CANOE\r\n\r\nSea Dyaks at work on a small dug-out. The tree has been felled, and the\r\ntrunk is being cut into shape and hollowed out. The Dyaks are using the\r\nnative axe or _bliong_, and the picture shows their method of handling\r\nit.]\r\n\r\nTo propel these boats the Dyaks use paddles about three feet or more in\r\nlength. The paddle used by the steersman is larger than those used by\r\nthe others, and the women use much smaller paddles than the men. These\r\ndug-out boats draw very little water, and are easily handled, and may be\r\npropelled at a good pace.\r\n\r\nIn shallow streams and in the rapids up-river, the Dyaks use small\r\ncanoes, which they propel with poles, standing up in the boat to do so.\r\n\r\nThe principal tools the Dyaks have for their work are the _duku_ and\r\n_bliong_. The _duku_ is a short, thick sword, or, rather, chopping-knife,\r\nabout two feet in length. The blade is either curved like a Turkish\r\nscimitar, or else quite straight. The handle is beautifully carved, and\r\nis made of hard wood or of horn. The _duku_ is used in war as well as for\r\nmore peaceful purposes. In the jungle it is indispensable, as without it\r\nthe Dyak would not be able to go through the thick undergrowth which he\r\nis often obliged to penetrate. It is, moreover, used for all purposes\r\nwhere a knife or chisel is used, and is a warrior’s blade as well as a\r\nwoodman’s hatchet.\r\n\r\nThe _bliong_ is the axe the Dyaks use, and is a most excellent tool.\r\nThey forge it of European steel, which they procure in bars. In shape it\r\nis like a small spade, about two and a half inches wide, with a square\r\nshank. This is set in a thin handle of hard wood, at the end of which\r\nthere is a woven pocket of cane to receive it. The lower end of this\r\nhandle has a piece of light wood fixed to it to form a firm grip for\r\nthe hand. The _bliong_ can be fixed in the handle at any angle, and is\r\ntherefore used as an axe or adze. With it the natives make their boats,\r\nand cut planks and do much of their carpentering work. The Dyak can cut\r\ndown a great forest tree with a _bliong_ in a very short time.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of the men is to build houses and to make boats, the work\r\nof the women is to weave cloth and make mats.\r\n\r\nThe cloth which the women weave is of two kinds, striped and figured. The\r\nformer is made by employing successively threads of different colours in\r\nstretching the web. This is simple enough. The other pattern is produced\r\nby a more elaborate process. Undyed white thread is used, and the web\r\nstretched. The woman sketches on this the pattern which she wishes to\r\nappear on the cloth, and carefully notes the different colours for the\r\ndifferent parts. If, for example, she wishes the pattern to be of three\r\ncolours—blue, red, and white—she takes up the threads of the web in\r\nlittle rolls of about twenty threads, and carefully wraps a quantity of\r\nvegetable fibre tightly round those parts which are intended to be red\r\nor white, leaving exposed those parts which are intended to be blue.\r\nAfter she has in this manner treated the whole web, she immerses it in\r\na blue dye made from indigo, which the Dyaks plant themselves. The dye\r\ntakes hold of the exposed portions of the threads, but is prevented by\r\nthe vegetable fibre from colouring the other parts. Thus the blue portion\r\nof the pattern is dyed. After it has been dried, the vegetable fibre is\r\ncut off, and the blue parts tied up, and only the portion to be dyed red\r\nexposed, and the web put into a red dye. In this way the red part of\r\nthe pattern is obtained. By a similar method all the colours needed are\r\nproduced. The weft is of one colour, generally light brown.\r\n\r\nDyak weaving is a very slow process. The woman sits on the floor, and the\r\nthreads of the weft are put through one by one. The cloth they make is\r\nparticularly strong and serviceable. The women seem to blend the colours\r\nthey use in a pleasing manner, though there is a great sameness in the\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRLS WEAVING\r\n\r\nThey are seated on mats on the floor. The threads are fastened to a\r\nframe, which is kept in position by a large band that is secured to the\r\ngirl’s waist, and she can tighten or loosen the threads by leaning back\r\nor bending forward. The threads of the weft are put through one by one\r\nfrom right to left and left to right.]\r\n\r\nMats are made either with split cane or from the outer bark of reeds.\r\nThe women are very clever at plaiting, and some of their mats have\r\nbeautiful designs.\r\n\r\nThey also make baskets of different sizes and shapes, some of which have\r\ncoloured designs worked into them.\r\n\r\nHunting is with the Dyaks an occasional pursuit. They live upon a\r\nvegetable rather than upon an animal diet. But in a Dyak house there are\r\ngenerally to be found one or two men who go out hunting for wild pig\r\nor deer on any days when they are free from their usual farm work. The\r\nDyak dogs are small and tawny in colour, and sagacious and clever in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nNative hunting with good dogs is easy work. The master loiters about, and\r\nthe dogs beat the jungle for themselves. When they have found a scent,\r\nthey give tongue, and soon run the animal to bay. The master knows from\r\nthe peculiar bark of the dogs if they are keeping some animal at bay, and\r\nfollows them and spears the game. The boars are fierce and dangerous when\r\nwounded, and turn furiously on the hunter, who often has to climb a tree\r\nto escape from their tusks. The dogs are very useful, and by attacking\r\nthe hind legs of the animal keep making it turn round.\r\n\r\nDeer are more easily run down than pigs, because they have not the\r\nstrength to go any great distance, especially in the hot weather.\r\n\r\nA favourite way of catching deer is to send a man to follow the spoor of\r\na deer, and to find out where it lies to rest during the heat of the day.\r\nThen large nets made of fine cane are hung around, and the deer is driven\r\ninto these by a large number of men, women, and boys making a noise. When\r\nthe deer is caught in the net, he is soon killed.\r\n\r\nA variety of traps are made by the Dyaks to catch birds and wild\r\nanimals. One of these traps (_peti_) set for killing wild pig is a\r\ndangerous contrivance by which many Dyaks have lost their lives. It\r\nconsists of a spring formed by a stick being tied to the end of a post\r\nand pulled apart from it. The end of this stick is armed with a sharp\r\nbamboo spear. I have known of several men being killed by this trap, and\r\nin Sarawak this particular trap is forbidden by the Government to be set.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks are very expert with the rod and line, and with them\r\nfishing is a favourite occupation. They begin fishing at an early age.\r\nFor bait they use worms or certain berries. Their hooks are made of brass\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nAnother method of fishing is by wooden floats (_pelampong_), generally\r\ncut in the form of a duck. Each has a baited hook fastened to it, and is\r\nset swimming down the stream. The owner of these floats drifts slowly in\r\nhis canoe after them, watching, till the peculiar motions of any of these\r\nducks shows that a fish has been hooked.\r\n\r\nThe _achar_ is a spoon-bait. A piece of mother-of-pearl shell or some\r\nwhite metal is cut in the form of a triangle. At the apex the line is\r\nattached, and at the base are fastened two or three hooks by a couple\r\nof inches of line. This appliance is generally used with a rod from the\r\nbows, and another man in the stern paddles the boat along.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks also have many varieties of fish-traps, which they set in the\r\nstreams and rivers. Most of these are made of split bamboo.\r\n\r\nThey also have nets of various kinds; the most popular is the _jala_,\r\nor circular casting-net, loaded with leaden or iron weights in the\r\ncircumference, and with a spread sometimes of twenty feet. Great skill\r\nis shown by the Dyak in throwing this net over a shoal of fish which he\r\nhas sighted. He casts the net in such a manner that all the outer edge\r\ntouches the water almost simultaneously. The weights cause it to sink and\r\nclose together, encompassing the fish, and the net is drawn up by a rope\r\nattached to its centre, the other end of which is tied to the fisherman’s\r\nleft wrist. The thrower of this net often stands on the bow of a small\r\ncanoe, and shows great skill in balancing himself. The _jala_ is used\r\nboth in fresh and salt water, and can be thrown either from the bank of a\r\nriver or by a man wading into the sea.\r\n\r\nBut the most favourite mode of fishing among the Dyaks is with the _tuba_\r\nroot (_Cocculus indicus_). Sometimes this is done on a small scale in\r\nsome little stream. Sometimes, however, the people of several Dyak houses\r\narrange to have a _tuba_-fishing. The men, women, and children of these\r\nhouses, accompanied by their friends, go to some river which has been\r\npreviously decided upon. A fence made by planting stakes closely together\r\nis erected from bank to bank. In the middle of this there is an opening\r\nleading into a square enclosure made in the same fashion, into which\r\nthe fish enter when trying to escape from the _tuba_ into fresh water.\r\nThe canoes then proceed several hours’ journey up the river, until they\r\nget to some place decided on beforehand. Here they stop for the night\r\nin small booths erected on the banks of the river. The small boats are\r\ncleared of everything in them so as to be ready for use the next day.\r\n\r\nAll the people bring with them fishing-spears and hand-nets. The spears\r\nare of various kinds—some have only one barbed point, while others have\r\ntwo or three. The shaft of the spear is made of a straight piece of\r\nbamboo about six feet long. The spear is so made that, when a fish is\r\nspeared the head of the weapon comes out of the socket in the bamboo; but\r\nas it is tied on to the shaft, it is impossible for the fish to escape.\r\nEven when the fisherman throws his spear at the fish, there is little\r\nchance of the fish escaping, because the bamboo bears it to the surface,\r\nand it is easy for the men to pick up the bamboo shaft and thus secure\r\nthe fish.\r\n\r\nMost of the people bring with them some _tuba_ root, made up into small\r\nclose bundles, the thickness of a man’s wrist, and about six inches long.\r\nEarly the next morning some of the canoes are filled with water, and the\r\nroot is beaten and dipped into it. For an hour or so fifty or more clubs\r\nbeat a lively tattoo on the root bundles, as they are held to the sides\r\nof the boats. The _tuba_ is dipped into the water in the boat, and wrung\r\nout from time to time. This gives the water a white, frothy appearance\r\nlike soap-suds. The Dyaks, armed with fish-spears and hand-nets, wait in\r\nreadiness in their canoes. At a given signal the poisoned liquid is baled\r\nout into the stream, and the canoes, after a short pause, begin to drift\r\nslowly down the current. The fish are stupefied by the _tuba_, and as\r\nthey rise struggling to the surface, are speared by the Dyaks. The large\r\nfish are thus secured amid much excitement, several canoes sometimes\r\nmaking for the same spot where a large fish is seen. The women and\r\nchildren join in the sport, and scoop up the smaller fish with hand-nets.\r\nThe _tuba_ does not affect the flesh of the fish, which can be cooked and\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nThis form of fishing, when carried out on a large scale, is always a\r\ngreat event among the Dyaks, because besides the large amount of fish\r\nsecured on these occasions, there is always a great deal of fun and\r\nexcitement, and it is looked upon as a pleasant sort of picnic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAKS RETURNING FROM TUBA-FISHING\r\n\r\nIn _tuba_ fishing the juice of the _tuba_ root is put in the water to\r\npoison it, and cause the fish to rise stupefied to the surface, when they\r\nare secured either with spears or by hand-nets. In the picture the men\r\nare seen taking up to the Dyak house their fish spears and the fish they\r\nhave succeeded in taking. The boats, which are dug-outs, each made out of\r\nthe trunk of a tree, are being made fast to the bank. The large hats the\r\nmen are wearing as a protection from the sun are made of palm leaves. On\r\nthe right of the picture is seen a three-pronged fish-spear.]\r\n\r\nFor superstitious reasons the Dyaks do not interfere with the crocodile\r\nuntil he has shown some sign of his man-eating propensity. If the\r\ncrocodile will live at peace with him, the Dyak has no wish to start a\r\nquarrel. If, however, the crocodile breaks the truce and kills someone,\r\nthen the Dyaks set to work to find the culprit, and keep on catching and\r\nkilling crocodiles until they find him. The Dyaks generally wear brass\r\nornaments, and by cutting open a dead crocodile they can easily find\r\nout if he is the creature they wish to punish. Sometimes as many as ten\r\ncrocodiles are killed before they manage to destroy the animal they want.\r\n\r\nThere are some men whose business it is to catch crocodiles, and who\r\nearn their living by that means; and whenever a human being has fallen\r\na victim to one of these brutes, a professional crocodile catcher is\r\nasked to help to destroy the murderer. The majority of natives will not\r\ninterfere with the reptiles, or take any part in their capture, probably\r\nfearing that if they did anything of the kind, they themselves may some\r\ntime or other suffer for it by being attacked by a crocodile.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary way of catching a crocodile is as follows. A piece of hard\r\nwood about an inch in diameter and about ten inches long, is sharpened\r\nto a point at each end. A length of plaited bark of the _baru_ tree,\r\nabout eight feet long, is tied to a shallow notch in the middle of this\r\npiece of wood, and a single cane or rattan, forty or fifty feet long,\r\nis tied to the end of the bark rope, and forms a long line. The most\r\nirresistible bait is the carcase of a monkey, though often the body of a\r\ndog or a snake is used. The more overpowering the stench, the greater is\r\nthe probability of its being taken, as the crocodile will only swallow\r\nputrifying flesh. When a crocodile has fresh meat, he carries it away and\r\nhides it in some safe place until it decomposes. This bait is securely\r\nlashed to the wooden bar, and one of the pointed ends is tied back with\r\na few turns of cotton to the bark rope, bringing the bar and rope into\r\nthe same straight line.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to suspend the bait from the bough of a tree\r\noverhanging the part of the river known to be the haunt of the animals.\r\nThe bait is hung a few feet above the high-water level, and the rattan\r\nline is left lying on the ground, and the end of the rattan is planted in\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nSeveral similar lines are set in different parts of the river, and there\r\nleft for days, until one of the baits is taken by a crocodile. Attracted\r\neither by the smell or sight of the bait, some animal raises itself from\r\nthe water and snaps at the hanging bundle, the slack line offering no\r\nresistance until the bait has been swallowed and the brute begins to\r\nmake off. Then the planted end of the line holds sufficiently to snap\r\nthe slight thread binding the pointed stick to the bark rope. The stick\r\nthus returns to its original position, at right angles to the line, and\r\nbecomes jammed across the crocodile’s stomach, the two sharpened points\r\nfixing themselves into the flesh.\r\n\r\nNext morning the trappers search for the missing traps, and seldom fail\r\nto find the coils of floating _rotan_, or cane, on the surface of some\r\ndeep pool at no great distance from the place where they were set. A firm\r\nbut gentle pull soon brings the crocodile to the surface, and if he be a\r\nbig one, he is brought ashore, though smaller specimens are put directly\r\ninto the boat, and made fast there.\r\n\r\nSometimes the cotton holding the bar to the line fails to snap. In that\r\ncase the crocodile, becoming suspicious of the long line attached to what\r\nhe has swallowed, manages to disgorge the bait and unopened hook in the\r\njungle, where it is sometimes found. But should the cotton snap and the\r\nbar fix itself in the animal’s inside, nothing can save the brute.\r\n\r\nThe formidable teeth of the crocodile are not able to bite through the\r\nrope attached to the bait, because the _baru_ fibres of which the rope is\r\nmade get between his pointed teeth, and this bark rope holds no matter\r\nhow much the fibres get separated.\r\n\r\nProfessional crocodile catchers are supposed to possess some wonderful\r\npower over the animals which enables them to land them and handle them\r\nwithout trouble. I have seen a man land a large crocodile on the bank by\r\nsimply pulling gently at the line. But this is not surprising, as from\r\nthe crocodile’s point of view there is nothing else to do but follow,\r\nwhen every pull, however gentle, causes considerable pain.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the proceeding is more remarkable. The animal is addressed\r\nin eulogistic language and beguiled, so the natives say, into offering\r\nno resistance. He is called a “rajah amongst animals,” and he is told\r\nthat he has come on a friendly visit, and must behave accordingly. First\r\nthe trapper ties up its jaws—not a very difficult thing to do. The next\r\nthing he does appears to me not very safe. Still speaking as before in\r\nhigh-flown language, he tells the crocodile that he has brought rings for\r\nhis fingers, and he binds the hind-legs fast behind the beast’s back, so\r\ntaking away from him his grip on the ground, and consequently his ability\r\nto use his tail. When one remembers what a sudden swing of the muscular\r\ntail means, one cannot help admiring the man who coolly approaches a\r\nlarge crocodile for the purpose of tying his hind-legs. Finally the\r\nfore-legs are tied in the same way over the animal’s back. A stout pole\r\nis passed under the bound legs, and the animal is carried away. He is\r\ntaken to the nearest Government station, the reward is claimed, and he\r\nis afterwards cut open, and the contents of his stomach examined.\r\n\r\nThough the animal is spoken to in such flattering terms before he is\r\nsecured, the moment his arms and legs are bound across his back and he is\r\npowerless for evil, they howl at him and deride him for his stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe professional crocodile catchers are generally Malays, who are sent\r\nfor whenever their services are required. But there are Dyaks who have\r\ngiven up their old superstitious dread of the animal, and are expert\r\ncrocodile catchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DYAK CHARACTER\r\n\r\n    General remarks—Kind to children—Industrious—Frugal—Honest—Two\r\n    cases of theft—Curses—Honesty of children—Truthful—Curious\r\n    custom—_Tugong Bula_—Hospitable—Morals—Desire for\r\n    children—Divorce—Adultery—Dyak law concerning adultery—Dyak\r\n    view of marriage—Unselfishness—Domestic affection—Example.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are seen at their best in their own jungle homes, in the midst\r\nof their natural surroundings. The man who has only met the hangers-on\r\nof the towns has little idea of their true character. To one who knows\r\nthem well, who has lived among them, and seen them at their work and at\r\ntheir play, there is something very attractive about the Dyaks. They are\r\nvery human, and in many points are very like children, with the child’s\r\nopenness in telling his thoughts and showing his feelings, with the\r\nchild’s want of restraint in gratifying his wishes, the child’s alternate\r\nmoods of selfishness and affection, obedience and obstinacy, restlessness\r\nand repose. Like children, they live in the present, and take little\r\nthought for the future. Like children, they love passionately those who\r\nare kind to them, and trust absolutely those whom they recognize as their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nThey are cheerful, merry, and pleasure-loving. Fine dress is a passion,\r\nand the love, in both men and women, for bright colours is very marked,\r\nand yet somehow the brilliant colours that are seen at a Dyak feast are\r\nnot at all displeasing. They are fond of song; the boatman sings as he\r\npaddles along. They are fond of games, and a Dyak feast is the occasion\r\nfor playing many games, and for friendly trials of strength. They are\r\nfond of dancing, and the two Dyak dances—the Sword Dance and the War\r\nDance—are always watched with interest by those present.\r\n\r\nThey are, like most Orientals, apathetic, and have no desire to rise\r\nabove their present condition. But they are truthful and honest, and are\r\nfaithful to those who have been kind to them; and these qualities cover a\r\nmultitude of deficiencies, and are rather unusual in Eastern races.\r\n\r\nThey are kind and affectionate to children, and in all the many years I\r\nlived in Borneo I did not meet a single instance of cruelty to children.\r\nThey are considerate to the aged, and parents who are past work are\r\ngenerally kindly treated by their children and grandchildren. They are\r\nmost hospitable to strangers, and offer them food and shelter. And yet\r\nthese are the people who some sixty years ago were dreaded pirates and\r\nterrible head-hunters! Their improvement under a kind and just Government\r\nhas been wonderful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK WOMAN MAKING A MAT WITH SPLIT CANE\r\n\r\nShe is seated on the outside open veranda of the Dyak house. The flooring\r\nin the picture is made of the round trunks of small trees, and these\r\nare tied down with cane. Sometimes the flooring is made of split palm\r\nor split bamboos, but more often of laths of _bilian_ or ironwood, so\r\nas to stand exposure to the weather. The outside uncovered veranda is a\r\nfavourite place to sit in in the cool of the evening.]\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are industrious and hard-working, and in the busy times of\r\npaddy-planting they work from early in the morning till dusk, only\r\nstopping for a meal at midday. The division of labour between the men and\r\nthe women is a very reasonable one, and the women have no more than their\r\nfair share of work. The men do the timber-felling, wood-cutting, clearing\r\nthe land, house and boat building, carrying burdens, and the heavier work\r\ngenerally. The women help in the lighter part of the farm work, husk\r\nand pound the rice they eat, cook, weave, make mats and baskets, fetch\r\nthe water for their daily use from the well or river, and attend to the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is frugal. He does not as a rule seek to accumulate wealth,\r\nbut he is careful of whatever he may earn. He plants each year what he\r\nsupposes will produce sufficient rice to supply his own needs—a portion\r\nof this is for family consumption, a portion for barter for such simple\r\nluxuries as tobacco, salt fish, cloth, etc., and a third portion for\r\nhospitality. If he happen to have an exceptionally good harvest, he may\r\nsell some paddy, and the money thus obtained is not lavishly squandered,\r\nbut saved with the object of investing in gongs or other brassware, old\r\njars, etc., which do not decrease in value with age. On such occasions\r\nas feasts nearly all the food and drink used are home products or begged\r\nfrom friends. A Dyak drinks water as a rule, but if he takes alcohol\r\nin any form, it is a home-brewed rice spirit (_tuak_). To spend money\r\nupon anything which he can make for himself, or for which he can make a\r\nsubstitute, is, in his opinion, needless waste.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak in his jungle home is remarkably honest. Families are often\r\naway from their homes for weeks at a time, living in little huts on\r\ntheir farms, and though no one is left in charge of their rooms, things\r\nare seldom stolen. Sometimes Dyaks become demoralized by associating\r\nwith other races in the towns, but a case of theft among the Dyaks in\r\ntheir native wilds is indeed rare. I have not been able to discover any\r\nenactment of traditional law which fixes the punishment for theft. It\r\nhas not been necessary to deal with the subject at all. In my missionary\r\ntravels in Borneo I have often left by mistake in a Dyak house some small\r\nthing like a soap-box, or a handkerchief, or a knife—things I know the\r\nDyaks love—but it has always been returned to me.\r\n\r\nWith an experience of nearly twenty years in Borneo, during which I came\r\ninto contact with thousands of the people, I have known of only two\r\ninstances of theft among the Dyaks. One was a theft of rice. The woman\r\nwho lost the rice most solemnly and publicly cursed the thief, whoever\r\nit might be. The next night the rice was secretly left at her door. The\r\nother was a theft of money. In this case, too, the thief was cursed.\r\nThe greater part of the money was afterwards found returned to the box\r\nfrom which it had been abstracted. Both these incidents show the great\r\ndread the Dyak has of a curse. Even an undeserved curse is considered\r\na terrible thing, and according to Dyak law, to curse a person for no\r\nreason at all is a fineable offence.\r\n\r\nA Dyak curse is a terrible thing to listen to. I have only once heard a\r\nDyak curse, and I am sure I do not want to do so again. I was travelling\r\nin the Saribas district, and at that time many of the Dyaks there had\r\ngone in for coffee-planting; indeed, several of them had started coffee\r\nplantations on a small scale. A woman told me that someone had over and\r\nover again stolen the ripe coffee-berries from her plantation. Not only\r\nwere the ripe berries stolen, but the thief had carelessly picked many of\r\nthe young berries and thrown them on the ground, and many of the branches\r\nof the plants had been broken off. In the evening, when I was seated in\r\nthe public part of the house with many Dyak men and women round me, we\r\nhappened to talk about coffee-planting. The woman was present, and told\r\nus of her experiences, and how her coffee had been stolen by some thief,\r\nwho, she thought, must be one of the inmates of the house. Then she\r\nsolemnly cursed the thief. She began in a calm voice, but worked herself\r\nup into a frenzy. We all listened horror-struck, and no one interrupted\r\nher. She began by saying what had happened, and how these thefts had gone\r\non for some time. She had said nothing before, hoping that the thief\r\nwould mend his ways; but the matter had gone on long enough, and she\r\nwas going to curse the thief, as nothing, she felt sure, would make him\r\ngive up his evil ways. She called on all the spirits of the waters and\r\nthe hills and the air to listen to her words and to aid her. She began\r\nquietly, but became more excited as she went on. She said something of\r\nthis kind:—\r\n\r\n“If the thief be a man, may he be unfortunate in all he undertakes!\r\nMay he suffer from a disease that does not kill him, but makes him\r\nhelpless—always in pain—and a burden to others. May his wife be\r\nunfaithful to him, and his children become as lazy and dishonest as he\r\nis himself. If he go out on the war-path, may he be killed, and his head\r\nsmoked over the enemy’s fire. If he be boating, may his boat be swamped\r\nand may he be drowned. If he be out fishing, may an alligator kill him\r\nsuddenly, and may his relatives never find his body. If he be cutting\r\ndown a tree in the jungle, may the tree fall on him and crush him to\r\ndeath. May the gods curse his farm so that he may have no crops, and have\r\nnothing to eat, and when he begs for food, may he be refused, and die of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\n“If the thief be a woman, may she be childless, or if she happen to be\r\nwith child let her be disappointed, and let her child be still-born,\r\nor, better still, let her die in childbirth. May her husband be untrue\r\nto her, and despise her and ill-treat her. May her children all desert\r\nher if she live to grow old. May she suffer from such diseases as are\r\npeculiar to women, and may her eyesight grow dim as the years go on, and\r\nmay there be no one to help her or lead her about when she is blind.”\r\n\r\nI have only given the substance of what she said; but I shall never\r\nforget the silence and the awed faces of those who heard her. I left the\r\nhouse early next morning, so I do not know what was the result of her\r\ncurse—whether the thief confessed or not.\r\n\r\nThe children are just as honest as their elders. A missionary used to\r\nvisit certain stations once a quarter. At one of the stations he had a\r\nsmall native hut built for his accommodation. On one occasion some small\r\nDyak boys came to him with three cents (less than one penny in value),\r\nwhich they said they wished to return to him. They had picked them up\r\nunder the floor of his hut. They thought they had fallen through the\r\nopen floor, and belonged to the missionary, and, as a matter of course,\r\nthey wished to return the money to the owner. I have never had occasion\r\nto punish any of the schoolboys living in my house for theft. They had\r\naccess to everything there was, but, though they had no scruples about\r\nasking for things, they never stole anything.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are also very truthful. So disgraceful indeed do the Dyaks\r\nconsider the deceiving of others by an untruth that such conduct is\r\nhanded down to posterity by a curious custom. They heap up a pile of the\r\nbranches of trees in memory of the man who has uttered a great lie, so\r\nthat future generations may know of his wickedness and take warning from\r\nit. The persons deceived start the _tugong bula_—“the liar’s mound”—by\r\nheaping up a large number of branches in some conspicuous spot by the\r\nside of the path from one village to another. Every passer-by contributes\r\nto it, and at the same time curses the man in memory of whom it is. The\r\nDyaks consider the adding to any _tugong bula_ they may pass a sacred\r\nduty, the omission of which will meet with supernatural punishment, and\r\nso, however pressed for time a Dyak may be, he stops to throw on the pile\r\nsome branches or twigs.\r\n\r\nA few branches, a few dry twigs and leaves—that is what the _tugong\r\nbula_ is at first. But day by day it increases in size. Every passer-by\r\nadds something to it, and in a few years’ time it becomes an imposing\r\nmemorial of one who was a liar. Once started, there seems to be no means\r\nof destroying a _tugong bula_. There used to be one by the side of the\r\npath between Seratok and Sebetan. As the branches and twigs that composed\r\nit often came over the path, on a hot day in the dry weather I have more\r\nthan once applied a match to it and burnt it down. In a very short time a\r\nnew heap of branches and twigs was piled on the ashes of the old _tugong\r\nbula_.\r\n\r\nIt has often been remarked by Dyaks that any other punishment would, if\r\na man had his choice, be much preferred to having a _tugong bula_ put up\r\nin his memory. Other punishments are soon forgotten, but this remains\r\nas a testimony to a man’s untruthfulness for succeeding generations\r\nto witness, and is a standing disgrace to his children’s children.\r\nBelieving, as the Dyaks do, in the efficacy of curses, it is easy to\r\nunderstand how a Dyak would dread the accumulation of curses which would\r\nnecessarily accompany the formation of a _tugong bula_.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very hospitable. They are always ready to receive and\r\nentertain strangers. A man travelling on foot through the Dyak country\r\nneed never trouble about food. He would be fed at the Dyak houses he\r\npassed on his journey, as part of their crops is reserved to feed\r\nvisitors. When the family meal is ready, visitors are invited to partake\r\nof it. If many visitors come to a house at the same time, some have their\r\nmeal with one family and some with another.\r\n\r\nThe morals of the Dyak from an Eastern point of view are good. There is\r\nno law to punish immorality between unmarried people. The parents do not\r\nseem to be strict, and it is considered no disgrace for a girl to be on\r\nterms of intimacy with the youths of her fancy until she has made her\r\nfinal choice. It is supposed that every young Dyak woman will eventually\r\nmarry, so her duty is plainly to choose a husband in her youth from\r\namong the many men she knows. And yet, for all this, I should say that\r\npromiscuous immorality is unknown. It is true that very often a girl is\r\nwith child before her marriage, but from the Dyak point of view this is\r\nno disgrace if the father acknowledges the child and marries the woman.\r\nThe greatest desire of the Dyak is to become a parent, to be known as\r\nfather or mother of So-and-so. They drop their own names after the birth\r\nof a child. A young couple in love have no opportunities of private\r\nmeetings excepting at night, and the only place is the loft where the\r\nyoung lady sleeps. The suitor pays his visit, therefore, when the rest of\r\nthe family are asleep, and she gets up from her bed and receives him. Two\r\nor three hours may be spent in her company before he leaves her, or if he\r\nshould be one whom she is not willing to accept as a husband, she soon\r\ngives him his dismissal. If acceptable, the young man may be admitted to\r\nsuch close intimacy as though they were already married. The reason is\r\nto ascertain the certainty of progeny. On his departure he leaves with\r\nthe young lady some ornament or article of his attire, as a pledge of his\r\nsincerity and good faith. On the first signs of pregnancy the marriage\r\nceremony takes place, and they are man and wife.\r\n\r\nDivorce is very uncommon after the birth of a child, but where there are\r\nno children, for such reasons as incompatibility of temper or idleness,\r\ndivorce is obtainable by either husband or wife by paying a small fine.\r\nThe women as a rule are faithful to their husbands, especially when they\r\nhave children, and adultery is very uncommon when there is a family.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak law respecting adultery is peculiar and worthy of notice. If a\r\nwoman commit adultery with a married man, his wife may make a complaint\r\nto the headman of the house, and receive a fine from the guilty woman;\r\nor, if she prefer it, she may waylay the guilty woman and thrash her; but\r\nif she do so, she must forgo one-half of the fine otherwise due to her.\r\nIn the eyes of the Dyak the woman is alone to blame in a case like this.\r\n“She knew,” they say, “the man has a wife of his own; she had no business\r\nto entice him away from her.” If a married man commits adultery with an\r\nunmarried woman the procedure is similar. The wife of the man may punish\r\nthe girl, but no one punishes the man. The whole blame, according to Dyak\r\nideas, falls on the woman for tempting the man.\r\n\r\nIf a married man commits adultery with a married woman, the husband of\r\nthe woman is allowed to strike him with a club or otherwise maltreat him,\r\nwhile the wife of the adulterer has the right to treat the adulteress in\r\nthe same way. The innocent husband supposes the one most to be blamed\r\nis not his wife, but her tempter, and _vice versâ_. This striking must\r\nnot, however, take place in a house; it must be done in the open. The\r\nclub used must not be of hard wood. Very often this striking is merely a\r\nmeans of publishing the fact that adultery has been committed, and no one\r\nis much hurt, but I have known cases where the man has been very badly\r\nwounded. No striking can take place after the matter has been talked\r\nabout or confessed, and if one knew for certain of a case of adultery,\r\none could easily stop this maltreatment of each other by talking about\r\nit publicly. The case is then settled by fining the guilty parties.\r\nWhere both parties are married, and no divorce follows, the fining is no\r\npunishment, because each party pays to the other.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak view of the marriage state, especially where there are children,\r\nis by no means a low one. Though an Oriental people living in a tropical\r\nclimate, their own traditional law allows a man to have only one wife.\r\nIf, as sometimes is the case, a couple continue to live together after\r\none of them has committed adultery, it is due to the fact that there are\r\nlittle children whom they do not want to part with, and not because they\r\nthink lightly of the crime of adultery.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very unselfish, and show a great deal of consideration\r\nfor each other. They live together under one roof in large communities.\r\nThough each family has a separate room, all the rooms are usually\r\nconnected one with another by little windows in the partition walls.\r\nThis communal life accounts for the good-nature and amiability of the\r\nDyaks. The happiness and comfort, to say nothing of the safety, of the\r\ncommunity in times past, depend largely on their getting on well one with\r\nanother. Therefore, as a natural result, there has grown up a great deal\r\nof unselfish regard for each other among the inmates of the Dyak village\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nDomestic affection between the different members of one family is very\r\ngreat. Especially is this the case between parents and children. An old\r\nfather or mother need never work unless they like. Their children will\r\nprovide for them.\r\n\r\nParents will risk their lives for their children. At Semulong, near\r\nBanting, a man and his son, a youth about twenty years old, were\r\nreturning from their farm, and had just arrived at the landing-place. The\r\nfather stepped out of the canoe, washed his feet on the river-bank, and\r\nthen turned to speak to his son in the boat. But the son had disappeared.\r\nThe father at once guessed that a crocodile had taken him, though he had\r\nheard no noise. He shouted for help from the village house, and at once\r\njumped into the water. He dived, and felt his hand strike the crocodile.\r\nDrawing his short sword (_duku_), he attacked the animal. He managed to\r\ndrive the point of his sword into the animal, when the beast let go his\r\nson. The father brought him at once to the nearest mission-station, where\r\nhe was treated, but after ten days died of tetanus. The inner part of the\r\nthigh and knee of one leg was torn away, so as to expose the ragged ends\r\nof sinews under the knee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHEAD-HUNTING\r\n\r\n    Head-hunting—Women an incentive—Gruesome story—Marriage of\r\n    Dyak Chiefs—Legend—Some customs necessitating a human head—A\r\n    successful head-hunter not necessarily a hero—A dastardly\r\n    crime—War expeditions—The spear token—My experience at a\r\n    village in Krian—Dyak war-costume—Weapons—The _Sumpit_—Poison\r\n    for darts—Consulting omen birds—War-boats—Camping—War\r\n    Council—Defences—War alarm—Ambushes—Decapitation and treatment\r\n    of head—Return from a successful expedition—Women dancing—Two\r\n    Christian Dyak Chiefs—Their views on the matter of head-taking.\r\n\r\n\r\nWarfare is an important element among all savage races, and the Dyaks\r\nare no exception to the rule. But it would be wrong to suppose that they\r\nare naturally abnormally bloodthirsty because head-hunting was such a\r\nregular practice with them. Mere love of fighting is not the only reason\r\nfor the terrible custom of head-hunting which at one time prevailed to\r\nsuch a great extent among the Dyaks, but which at present, under the\r\nrule of Rajah Brooke, is fast dying out. There are many other causes.\r\nTheft committed by one tribe against another, revenge for the murder of\r\nsome of their friends, and a thousand other minor pretexts, are often\r\nthe origin of an expedition of one tribe against another. The Dyaks are\r\nfaithful, hospitable, just, and honest to their friends, and, being so,\r\nit naturally follows that they avenge any act of injustice or cruelty\r\nto them, and they are consequently bloodthirsty and revengeful against\r\ntheir enemies, and willing to undergo fatigue, hunger, want of sleep, and\r\nother privations when on the war-path. I have often been told by Dyaks\r\nthat the reason why the young men are so anxious to bring home a human\r\nhead is because the women have so decided a preference for a man who has\r\nbeen able to give proof of his bravery by killing one of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe desire to appear brave in the eyes of his lady-love sometimes leads\r\na young man to mean and cowardly crimes. The following gruesome incident\r\nactually took place many years ago. A young man in the Batang Lupar\r\nstarted by himself to seek for a head from a neighbouring tribe. In a few\r\ndays he came back with the desired prize. His relatives asked him how it\r\nwas he was able to get to the enemy’s country and back in such a short\r\ntime. He replied gravely that the spirits of the woods had assisted him.\r\nAbout a month afterwards a headless trunk was discovered near one of\r\ntheir farms. It was found to be the body of his victim, an old woman of\r\nhis own tribe, not very distantly related to himself!\r\n\r\nIn the old days no Dyak Chief of any standing could be married unless\r\nhe had been successful in procuring the head of an enemy. (See also\r\nChapter XXII.) For this reason it was usual to make an expedition into\r\nthe enemy’s country before the marriage-feast of any great Chief could\r\nbe held. The head brought home need not be that of a man; the head of a\r\nwoman or a child would serve the purpose quite as well.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend related among the Dyaks as a reason for this custom.\r\nOnce upon a time a young man loved a maiden, but she refused to marry him\r\nuntil he had brought to her some proof of what he was able to do. He\r\nwent out hunting and killed a deer, and brought it to her, but still she\r\nwould have nothing to say to him. He went again into the jungle, and, to\r\nshow his courage, fought and killed a _mias_ (orang-utan), and brought it\r\nhome as a proof of his courage; but still she turned away from him. Then,\r\nin anger and disappointment, he rushed out and killed the first man he\r\nsaw, and, throwing the victim’s head at the maiden’s feet, he blamed her\r\nfor the crime she had led him to commit. To his surprise, she smiled on\r\nhim, and said to him that at last he had brought her a worthy gift, and\r\nshe was ready to marry him.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that, according to ancient custom, no Dyak could\r\nmarry without having first procured a human head as a token of his\r\nvalour. This is not true. It was only in cases of the great men—their\r\nChiefs—that such a thing was necessary. A little consideration will show\r\nhow impossible it was for every man who married to be the owner of the\r\nhead of some human victim.\r\n\r\nThere were certain ancient customs which necessitated the possession of a\r\nhuman head. When any person died the relatives went into mourning. They\r\nput away their ornaments and finery, which were tied together in bundles.\r\nAt the feast in honour of the dead—_Begawai Antu_—these were all undone,\r\nand the women and men put on their finery again. Some man cut the string\r\nwith which they were tied up. Before he could do such a thing, it used\r\nto be necessary that a human head be brought into the house, and it was\r\nusual for the man who had obtained that head to take a leading part in\r\nthe ceremonies and cut open the bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIVE DYAKS IN WAR DRESS WITH SPEARS AND SHIELDS\r\n\r\nThe spears are made of steel and have shafts of hard heavy wood. The\r\nshields are each cut out of one piece of wood, and are often coloured\r\nwith some fantastic design. Sometimes, as in the case of the man’s\r\nshield on the left, cross pieces of cane or wood are fixed in the shield\r\nto prevent it splitting. The second man on the left is wearing a large\r\nsleeveless jacket, or collar, of skin to protect his shoulders from\r\nwounds.]\r\n\r\nAgain, it was customary in some tribes to bring home a head as an\r\noffering to the spirits when a new village was to be built.\r\n\r\nBoth these customs are no longer observed. At the feast in honour of the\r\ndead—_Begawai Antu_—the headman of the house generally cuts open the\r\nbundles of finery that have been put away, and at the building of a new\r\nhouse the killing of a pig is supposed to be sufficient to satisfy the\r\ndemands of the spirits.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that a man who has secured a human head must necessarily\r\nbe brave. But this need not be the case at all, for, as has been said,\r\nthe head of a woman or child will serve the purpose. And these heads need\r\nnot be obtained in open warfare. Very often the head of an enemy is taken\r\nwhile he is asleep. Nor is it necessary that a man should kill his victim\r\nwith his own hand. Frequently many of his friends assist him in killing\r\nsome unfortunate man whom they have waylaid, and then he comes home with\r\nthe head, and poses as a hero!\r\n\r\nIt was customary in the old days to announce an expedition that one tribe\r\nintended to take against another at one of their feasts, when the village\r\nwas thronged with guests from far and near. Some great Chief would\r\nadvance his reason for the intended attack. Either some of his people had\r\nbeen slain, and revenge was called for, or else they wished to put off\r\ntheir mourning, and for that required a human head taken in war. Perhaps\r\nthe reason was that they intended to build a new village house, and so\r\nrequired some human heads to use as offerings to the spirit of the land;\r\nor possibly he himself wished to marry, and wanted a head as a proof of\r\nhis valour in the eyes of his lady-love. Among the crowd who listened\r\nto him there were sure to be many who were willing to follow him on the\r\nwar-path. The women would help him by urging their husbands, or lovers,\r\nor brothers, to go. Out of the crowd of eager followers the Chief would\r\nchoose a certain number to form a Council of War. These would discuss the\r\nwhole matter, and it would be decided when the party was to start for the\r\nenemy’s country. Details would also be discussed—how much food each man\r\nwas to take with him, by what route they were to go. The time of the year\r\ngenerally chosen would be just after the planting season, because that\r\nwould give the men a clear three months before the harvest. The weeding\r\nof the paddy-fields between the planting season and the harvest is work\r\nthat is usually done by the women.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do would be to send the War Spear round to the\r\nneighbouring villages, to let all know when the expedition was to take\r\nplace, and where it was to start from. A man would bring this spear to a\r\nlong Dyak house, deliver his message, and return, leaving the spear to be\r\ncarried on by one of the men in that house to the next village, and so\r\non. At once the men in the house would get their war-boats ready. They\r\nwould begin making figure-heads for the bows of their boats, and paint\r\nthe side planks in various patterns. They would furbish up their arms,\r\nand sharpen their weapons, and decorate their helmets and war-jackets.\r\nThe Dyaks generally wear their best when going out to fight. I asked a\r\nDyak once why this was done, because, as I pointed out to him, most of\r\nthe finery they put on interfered with the free action of their limbs.\r\nHis answer was that if they were well dressed, in case of their death,\r\nthe enemy who saw the bodies would know that they were not slaves, but\r\nfree men of some standing.\r\n\r\nIn the present day, under the rule of Rajah Brooke, no Sea Dyaks may go\r\nout on a fighting expedition unless called out for that purpose by the\r\nGovernment. I remember not long ago that there were some rebels in the\r\nupper reaches of the Batang Lupar River, who had been guilty of many\r\nmurders, and would not submit to the Government. After trying milder\r\nmeasures without any effect, it was decided to take a force into their\r\ncountry, and the Government sent round the War Spear to let the people\r\nof the different villages know they were to be ready to go on expedition\r\nat a certain date. I happened to be in a Dyak village in the Krian. It\r\nwas evening, and I was seated on a mat in the open veranda of the house,\r\nand round me were seated a crowd of men and women, whom I was trying\r\nto teach. A man arrived at the house with a spear decorated with red\r\ncloth. At first no one noticed him. He spoke to a man near the top of the\r\nladder of the house. The man came up to the middle of the house, where I\r\nwas seated, and said something which I did not quite catch. At once the\r\nwhole crowd got up and left me. They listened eagerly to what the man who\r\nbrought the spear had to say. I was not left long in doubt of what it all\r\nmeant. The message the man brought was short and to the point: “You are\r\nto be ready with your war-boats, and be at Simanggang at the next full\r\nmoon. There is to be an expedition up the river.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to describe the change that came over the crowd.\r\nThe headman of the house at once asked a youth to carry on the spear\r\nto the next house with the same message. The men at once discussed the\r\nquestion of war-boats, and it was decided there and then that they\r\nshould begin making a new war-boat the next day. The women were just as\r\nexcited about the expedition as the men, and there was a general turning\r\nout of war-caps and war-jackets which had long been put away.\r\n\r\nThe costume a Dyak wears when going on the war-path consists of a\r\nbasket-work cap decorated with feathers and sometimes with human hair,\r\na sleeveless skin jacket, or in place of it a sleeveless quilted cotton\r\njacket, and the usual Dyak costume of the waist-cloth (_sirat_). For\r\nweapons they have a sword, or _duku_. This may be of foreign or of\r\ntheir own make. It is a dangerous weapon at close quarters, and is\r\nwhat they use to cut off the head of a fallen enemy. They also have a\r\nspear, consisting of a long wooden shaft of some hard wood with a steel\r\nspear-head, which is tied on to the shaft with rattan. Sometimes the\r\nshaft of the spear is the _sumpit_, or blow-pipe. For defensive purposes\r\nthe Dyak has a large wooden shield about three feet long, which, with its\r\nhandle, is hollowed out of a single block of wood. It is held in the left\r\nhand well advanced before the body, and meant not so much to receive the\r\nspear-point as to divert it by a twist of the hand. It is often painted\r\nin bright colours, with some elaborate design or fantastic pattern, and\r\noften decorated with human hair.\r\n\r\nThe _sumpit_, or blowpipe, is a long wooden tube about eight feet long.\r\nThe smoothness and straightness of the bore is remarkable. The hole is\r\ndrilled with an iron rod, one end of which is chisel-pointed, through a\r\nlog of hard wood, which is afterwards pared down, and rounded till it is\r\nabout an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK IN WAR DRESS\r\n\r\nHolding up his shield in readiness to receive the attack of the enemy.\r\nHe is holding his sword in his right hand. The shield is decorated with\r\nhuman hair.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUMAN HEADS\r\n\r\nThe heads of slain enemies are smoked and preserved and looked upon as\r\nvaluable possessions. The above is a bunch of old heads as they appear\r\nhanging from the rafters of a Dyak house.]\r\n\r\nThe dart used with the _sumpit_ is usually made of a thin splinter of\r\nthe wood of the _nibong_ palm, stuck into a round piece of very light\r\nwood, so as to afford a surface for the breath to act upon. These darts\r\nare sharpened to a fine point, and are carried in neatly carved bamboo\r\nquivers.\r\n\r\nThe poison that is used for these darts is obtained from the _epoh_ tree\r\n(upas). Incisions are made in the tree, and the gutta which exudes is\r\ncollected and cooked over a slow fire on a leaf until it assumes the\r\nconsistency of soft wax. It is a potent and deadly poison. Some Dyaks\r\nsay that the most deadly poison is made of a mixture of the gum from the\r\n_epoh_ tree and that from some creeper.\r\n\r\nA dart is put in at one end, and the _sumpit_ is lifted to the mouth,\r\nand with the breath the dart is driven out. Up to twenty-five yards\r\nthey shoot with accuracy, but though the darts can be sent fifty yards\r\nor more, at any distance greater than twenty-five yards their aim is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nBefore starting on a war expedition, the Dyaks consult the omen birds.\r\nThe headman of the village, with the help of a few chosen friends, builds\r\na little hut at a convenient distance from the Dyak house, and stays\r\nthere, listening to the voices of the birds. If the first omens he hears\r\nare unfavourable, he continues living there until he hears some bird of\r\ngood omen. When this happens, the men get ready their war-boats and start\r\nfor the appointed meeting-place.\r\n\r\nThe war-boat is generally made in the same way as the Dyak dug-outs in\r\nordinary use, out of the trunk of one large tree, only it is very much\r\nlarger and longer, and able to hold sixty men or more. They paint this\r\nboat with a pattern of red and white—the red is an ochre and the white is\r\nlime. It is propelled with paddles, and the steering is done with one or\r\ntwo greatly developed fixed paddles, which the steersman works with his\r\nfoot if he happens to be standing up.\r\n\r\nSometimes the war-boat is built of planks in the following manner. First\r\nthey make a long _lunas_, or keel plank, of hard wood the whole length\r\nof the boat. This has two ledges on each side on its upper surface,\r\neach about an inch from the edge of the keel. Then several planks are\r\nmade, all of which are also the entire length of the boat. Each plank\r\nhas an inside ledge on its upper edge, its lower edge being quite plain.\r\nWhen the Dyaks have made as many planks as are necessary, they put them\r\ntogether in the following manner. The keel plank is put in position,\r\nthen the first side-planks are brought and placed with their lower or\r\nplain edges upon the two ledges of the keel planks. The ledge of the\r\nfirst side-plank receives in turn the next plank, and so on, till they\r\nhave enough planks, generally four or five, on each side. The ledges and\r\nthe planks next to them are bored, and firm rattan lashings are passed\r\nfrom one to the other. The seams are caulked up so as to render the\r\nboat watertight. In the construction of a boat of this kind no nails\r\nor bolts are employed—nothing but planks ingeniously fastened together\r\nwith cane or rattan. These lashings are not very durable, as the rattans\r\nsoon get rotten. But this is of little consequence, as the boat is only\r\nused for war expeditions, and on her return the lashings are cut, and\r\nthe separated planks are stored in the Dyak house. When she is again\r\nrequired, the planks are got out and the boat reconstructed as before.\r\n\r\nThis kind of war-boat is not often seen nowadays. It is clumsy, and does\r\nnot travel very fast. In the whole of my experience I have only seen one\r\nboat of this kind in course of construction.\r\n\r\nDyak war-boats hold from thirty to a hundred men. When filled with dusky\r\nwarriors with naked arms and legs just visible beneath the palm-leaf\r\nawning, paddling with a regular, vigorous stroke, with their Chief\r\nstanding in the stem working the rudder with hand or foot, they form a\r\ngrand sight.\r\n\r\nWhen all the boats have arrived, a start is made for the enemy’s country.\r\nThe line of advance is most irregular. There are wide gaps between the\r\nboats, some lagging behind to cook or fish, and others, deterred by bad\r\ndreams or unpropitious omens, waiting a day or two before moving on.\r\n\r\nWhen the landing-place of the enemy is reached, a camp is formed, and\r\ntemporary huts are built lining the river bank. The warriors lie down to\r\nrest side by side. Their spears are stuck in the ground near them, and\r\ntheir shields and swords are by their side, so that they can spring to\r\ntheir feet in a moment, ready for battle. The boats are hauled ashore and\r\nhidden in the brushwood, to be used again on the return journey.\r\n\r\nA War Council is held and the route decided upon, and the best way to\r\nattack the enemy discussed. On a given day the march commences, each\r\nshouldering his pack containing a cooking-pot, rice, etc. The pace is\r\nmore or less rapid as long as they are far from the enemy, but slackens\r\nwhen they come nearer. The leaders proceed warily, as the enemy may be in\r\nambush by the way.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks who are expecting an attack defend their houses with a strong\r\npalisading of hard wood, strengthened by bamboo stakes fixed between\r\nthe perpendicular posts, with the sharpened points projecting in all\r\ndirections, presenting an impassable barrier of spikes to the invader.\r\nThe whole is tied firmly together with rattan or creepers. This fence is\r\nabout six feet high, and surrounds the whole village. Two gates are made\r\nin it, but when these are closed, they present the same appearance as the\r\nrest of the palisading.\r\n\r\nThe landing-places and approach to the village are all protected with\r\nsharpened spikes of bamboo or hard wood. Their valuables—their jars and\r\nbrass gongs, etc.—they conceal in the jungle.\r\n\r\nIf they feel confident that they are able to repel the attack of the\r\nenemy they keep the women and children at home. If there is any doubt\r\nabout the matter, they too are hidden away in the forest, and when\r\nresistance becomes hopeless, they are rejoined by their relatives at some\r\nfixed rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe moment the enemy appears, the gongs are struck in a peculiar manner,\r\nthree strokes following each other very rapidly, a short pause, and then\r\nthree strokes again, and so on. When the neighbours hear this, they\r\nrecognize the signal, and know that their friends have been attacked, and\r\nthey hurry to their help.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK WARFARE\r\n\r\nThe figures in this picture are posed to give some idea of Dyak warfare.\r\nIn the foreground is a dead man. The Dyak over him is grasping his hair\r\nand about to cut off his head. The two figures on the left and the man\r\nbehind are waiting with their spears to attack the man who has taken\r\nrefuge in the hole in the stump of a tree.]\r\n\r\nA favourite stratagem of defence in the lower reaches of the river is\r\nto entice the leading boats of the enemy into an ambush on shore. There\r\nare sure to be some boats of the attacking party far in advance of the\r\nothers, as they are anxious to be foremost in the fight. The defenders\r\nchoose a convenient spot, and a strong party is placed in ambush among\r\nthe trees. One or two men stroll upon the shingly bank to lure the enemy.\r\nAs the warriors from the attacking boats leap ashore, the men in ambush\r\nspring from their hiding-place. They throw large stones at them, and\r\nbreak their wooden shields. They engage with swords and spears in a short\r\nand desperate conflict. As the main body comes round the bend of the\r\nriver, whooping and yelling, they plunge into the jungle with the heads\r\nthat they have obtained, and are soon safely far away.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks do not attack a village or group of villagers, if their\r\napproach has been discovered and the people are on the defensive. Under\r\nthese circumstances they content themselves with cutting off stragglers,\r\nor hide near the waterside for people who are going to bathe or on their\r\nway to examine their fish-traps. These they attack unawares, cut down,\r\ntake their heads, and flee into the jungle before the alarm can be given.\r\n\r\nIn fighting the Dyak warriors gather round their Chiefs, and defend them\r\nbravely. Relatives often congregate together and help to defend each\r\nother. When one of them is killed, rather than allow the enemy to take\r\nhis head, they decapitate him themselves, and bring his head back. When\r\npossible, they carry their dead and wounded away with them, but more\r\noften they only take their heads, and bury the bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks, after having severed the head at the neck, scoop out\r\nthe brains with a bit of bamboo either through the nostrils or by the\r\noccipital hole, cover the eyes with leaves, and hang the head up to dry\r\nin the smoke of a wood fire. They cut off the hair to ornament their\r\nsword-hilts and sheaths, as well as their shields.\r\n\r\nThough cannibalism is not practised by the Dyaks, yet I have heard that\r\nsometimes a man who has taken a head eats a small piece from the cheek,\r\nin the hope of acquiring the bravery and virtues of the man killed. A\r\nDyak in the Saribas district told me he attempted to eat a little of the\r\nbrain of an enemy he had killed, but was unable to do so. Deep in the\r\nmind of the primitive man of every country lies the idea that he can\r\nacquire the attributes of another by eating his flesh or drinking his\r\nblood. The Dacota Indian, I am told, eats the heart of his slain enemy,\r\nand the New Zealander his eyes. It would appear that the Dyaks have the\r\nsame idea.\r\n\r\nOn the return from a war expedition, if the people of any particular\r\nboat have been fortunate enough to secure a human head, word is sent up\r\nto the Dyak village house of this fact, as soon as the boat reaches the\r\nlanding-stage. The men remain in the boat, and wait there till all the\r\nwomen-folk from the house come to it, dressed in their best. Generally\r\nonly the men dance, and the arrival of a boat bearing the ghastly trophy\r\nof a human head is the only occasion when the women dance. The excitement\r\nis great, and there are continual shouts of triumph as the women, singing\r\na monotonous chant, surround the hero who has killed the enemy and lead\r\nhim to the house. He is seated in a place of honour, and the head is put\r\non a brass tray before him, and all crowd round him to hear his account\r\nof the battle, and how he succeeded in killing one of their foes and\r\nbringing home his head.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, it will be seen how the Dyaks value the\r\nheads taken in war. They hang them over the fireplaces in the long open\r\nveranda of their houses, they make offerings to them, and they believe\r\nthat the souls of those whom they have slain will be their slaves in\r\nthe other world. I look upon it as a remarkable fact worthy of record\r\nthat two great Dyak Chiefs who became Christians—one the Orang Kaya of\r\nPadih, Saribas, and the other, Tarang of Krian—should have taken such\r\na decided step as to refuse to treasure their enemies’ heads any more.\r\nThey were both men of position, with a great reputation for bravery. The\r\nOrang Kaya buried all the heads he possessed, and gave out that none\r\nof his followers in a war expedition should bring back heads. Two of\r\nhis grandchildren were at my school in Temudok for some years. A son of\r\nTarang, Tujoh by name, worked as my catechist in Krian for some years.\r\nI asked him what his father did with the old heads he possessed when he\r\nrefused to keep them himself. He told me that he did not think his father\r\nacted wisely in that matter. His relatives begged for the heads, and he\r\ngave them to them, and they did just what his father did not wish—made a\r\nfeast in honour of these heads, and treasured them!\r\n\r\nWhile so many Dyak Christians are most unwilling to give up their old\r\nheathen customs, these two Christian Dyak Chiefs happily took up the\r\nright attitude in such an important matter in the eyes of the Dyaks as\r\nhead-taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOCIAL LIFE\r\n\r\n    Social position of the women—Dyak food—Meals—Cooking food in\r\n    bamboo—Law with regard to leaving a Dyak house—Rule of the\r\n    headman—A Dyak trial—Power of the headman in old days—Dyak\r\n    wealth—Valuable jars—_Gusi_—_Naga_—_Rusa_—A convenient\r\n    dream—Trading incident at Sebetan—Land tenure—Laws about\r\n    fruit-trees—Slavery—Captives in war—Slaves for debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyak woman does not hold, as in most Eastern countries, an inferior\r\nand humiliating position. As has already been stated, the women do no\r\nmore than a fair share of the work: they cook, make garments and mats,\r\nhelp in the lighter part of farm work, and husk and pound the grain. The\r\nmen do the timber-felling, wood-cutting, clearing of the land, house and\r\nboat building, and all the heavier work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dyaks meet together to discuss any matter such as the\r\nadvisability of migrating to a new house, the women are allowed to take\r\npart in the discussion. Generally the men sit round in a circle, and\r\nbehind them are the women and children. And it is no unusual thing to\r\nhear a woman express an opinion, and her remarks are listened to with\r\ndeference by the men.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak women have no reason to complain of their lot. Their wants are\r\nfew and easily satisfied. They may have sometimes a little more than\r\ntheir fair share of work, but this is always the case where the men\r\nspend much time on the war-path, and as the women keep the men up to the\r\nmark in this respect, and often will not marry a man who has not been\r\nsuccessful in war, they are scarcely to be pitied if extra work fall to\r\ntheir lot during the time the men are away fighting.\r\n\r\nThe women are earlier risers than the men, and retire to bed earlier.\r\nThey generally go to the river as soon as they wake, carrying their\r\nwater-gourds with them. They have a bath, fill their gourds with water,\r\nand return to the house to cook the morning meal.\r\n\r\nThe principal article of food is rice, which is cooked in brass or iron\r\npots. When the rice is ready, it is put out on plates. They eat with\r\ntheir rice either vegetables or fish. Sometimes they have the flesh\r\nof wild pig or venison, but that is not usual. A favourite method of\r\ncooking is to put the proper quantity of fish or vegetables or meat with\r\nsufficient water and a little salt into a newly-cut bamboo. The mouth\r\nis then stopped up with leaves, and the bamboo is placed over the fire,\r\nresting on a stone at an angle of 45 degrees or more. By the time the\r\nbamboo is thoroughly charred the contents are sufficiently cooked, and it\r\nis taken from the fire and emptied out into a plate. Sometimes rice is\r\ncooked in bamboos, and when it is ready to be eaten, the bamboo is split\r\nand torn off in strips, when the rice is found well cooked inside—a stiff\r\nmass moulded in the form of the bamboo.\r\n\r\nWhen the food is ready and put out in plates, the men are asked to come\r\ninto the room and eat. Sometimes the women eat with the men; but if there\r\nare too many to eat comfortably at one sitting, the men have their meal\r\nfirst, and the women eat with the children after the men have done.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks all sit on the floor, which also serves as their table. They\r\nhave their rice on plates, or sometimes upon clean leaves. They eat with\r\ntheir fingers, dipping the hand when necessary into the common stock of\r\nsalt, or common dish of meat or vegetables. They eat with their right\r\nhand, compressing the rice into portions of convenient size.\r\n\r\nNearly every animal is eaten by the Dyaks; fish, venison, and pork are\r\neaten by all, but many tribes eat monkeys, snakes, and even crocodiles.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast is over, they clean the crockery and put it away. The mats\r\nare swept and taken up, and the refuse thrown through the open floor for\r\nthe pigs and poultry under the house to eat.\r\n\r\nEach long Dyak village house has its headman, who generally occupies a\r\nroom in the middle of the house. He is called the _tuai rumah_—“the old\r\nman or chief of the house”—and he settles all disputes among the inmates,\r\nand decides the amount of the fine the guilty party has to pay. Great\r\ndeference is paid to him, and as a general rule his people abide by his\r\ndecisions. But his power is only one of persuasion, and depends upon his\r\npersonal ability and sense of justice. He cannot in any way coerce his\r\npeople into obedience. Upon the prestige and conduct of this _tuai rumah_\r\ndepends the number of families a Dyak house contains. If he be a man of\r\nstrong personal character, clear-headed, and upright in his dealings,\r\nmany will settle under him. If he be otherwise, he will quickly lose the\r\nfamilies living in his house. They will migrate to other houses where the\r\nheadman is one they admire and respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK HOUSES\r\n\r\nShowing the outside open platform where paddy, etc., is put out to dry.\r\nWhere the eaves are very low, parts of it are often raised to admit more\r\nlight into the house. The palm trees in the picture are cocoanut palms.]\r\n\r\nThere are certain laws among the Dyaks with regard to a family leaving a\r\nhouse. If a new house is to be built, any families of the former inmates\r\nmay refuse to make their home in the new house, and may join some other\r\nvillage or decide to build a house for themselves. If a family wish to\r\nleave a house at any other time, they must not only leave the posts,\r\nroof, and flooring of their part of the house, but they must undertake to\r\nkeep these in repair until such a time as the house is pulled down and a\r\nnew one built.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyak administration of law among themselves by the headman of the\r\nhouse has its advantages. Disputes are settled at once and on the spot.\r\nUnfortunately sometimes prejudice and the ties of relationship impede the\r\ncarrying out of justice, but more often the Chiefs are peculiarly alive\r\nto the advantage of a just administration, which never fails to secure\r\nthe aid and support of the majority of the people.\r\n\r\nI have often been present when some small dispute was settled by the\r\nheadman of a Dyak house. Both parties and their friends sat on mats in a\r\ncircle before the Chief. Each party had their say; the headman asked a\r\nfew questions. Then he pronounced judgment somewhat after this fashion.\r\nHe began by saying that as the disputants were living in the same\r\nhouse—“brothers and sisters” so to speak—it was not necessary to inflict\r\na heavy punishment; all that was needed was to impose a small fine to\r\nshow which was in the wrong, and one party must pay the other a fine of\r\nso many cups or so many plates as the case required.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have been present, the fine was cheerfully paid. The\r\npunishment, in fact, was very slight. Though the Government recognize\r\nthis method of settling disputes among themselves, still, if Dyaks are\r\ndiscontented with the decision of their headmen, they can always bring\r\ntheir case for trial before the Government officer of the district. But\r\nthis is seldom done. The fine imposed by the headman is so small compared\r\nto that which would have to be paid if the case were tried elsewhere\r\nthat the guilty party generally prefers to pay it cheerfully rather than\r\nappeal to the Government.\r\n\r\nIf the dispute be between the inmates of one house and those of another,\r\nthen the headmen of both houses have to be present at the trial. When\r\nmatters are at all complicated, headmen from other houses are also asked\r\nto be present and help in the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nI learn from conversations with the older Dyaks that in bygone days the\r\npower of the headman was much greater than it is now. Then he used to\r\nimpose much heavier fines and take part of them himself for his trouble,\r\nand no Dyak dared to murmur against the decision of his Chief. In those\r\ndays there was no court of appeal. The only means of protesting was to\r\nleave the house and build on to another, and in the old days such a thing\r\nwas not so easily done as at present. The Dyak houses were much longer\r\nand built much farther apart, and to join another house meant moving to a\r\ndistrict very far away and cutting off all connection with relatives and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWealth among the Dyaks is not so much the accumulation of money as the\r\npossession of brass gongs, guns, and valuable jars. Money is not used\r\nexcept by the inhabitants of the towns. The up-country Dyaks procure what\r\nthey need by a system of barter, and in most of the shopping done in the\r\nChinese bazaars near the Dyak villages no money passes hands at all.\r\nSilver coins are used by the Dyaks for making belts and bangles, and are\r\noften attached to the edge of the petticoats worn by the women at feasts\r\nand on other special occasions, and are esteemed only as ornaments.\r\nBrass ware of all kinds is much valued, especially old brass guns and\r\ngongs.\r\n\r\nThe valuable jars (_tajau_) which the Dyaks prize so highly are in\r\nappearance much like the earthen water-pots that are manufactured in\r\nlarge numbers by the Chinese, and which cost from five to ten shillings.\r\nBut closer examination shows certain differences. The Dyaks are prepared\r\nto pay exorbitant prices for a really old jar, and they venerate it\r\nand make offerings to it. The best known of these sacred jars are the\r\n_Gusi_, the _Naga_, and the _Rusa_. The first is the most valuable of\r\nthe three. It is of a greenish colour, about eighteen inches high, and\r\nis much sought after. A good one would cost £80 or more. The _Naga_ is\r\nabout two feet high, and is called by that name because it is ornamented\r\nwith Chinese figures of dragons, or _naga_. It is worth from eight to ten\r\npounds. The _Rusa_ is covered with the representation of some kind of\r\ndeer (_rusa_), and is worth about four pounds. These prices, except the\r\nfirst, may not seem very great to our ideas, but when one remembers how\r\npoor the Dyaks are, they are very large amounts for them to pay for such\r\nfragile things as earthenware jars.\r\n\r\nThe _Gusi_ is always kept wrapped in cloth and treated with the greatest\r\nrespect. People crawl in its presence, and touch it with the greatest\r\ncare. At certain feasts a jar of this kind is brought out, and offerings\r\nare made to it. Besides being the abode of a spirit, it is supposed to\r\npossess marvellous qualities—one of them being that if anything be placed\r\nin it overnight, the quantity will increase before morning; another, that\r\nfood kept in a jar of this kind has peculiar medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nWhen any of these sacred jars are bought, before bringing it into the\r\nroom where it is to be kept an offering is always made to it. A chicken\r\nis killed and the blood smeared on the jar.\r\n\r\nIt is not known for certain where these jars originally came from. One\r\ntheory is that many years ago a colony of Chinese settled in Borneo for a\r\nshort period, and made these jars and then left the country.\r\n\r\nThese old jars have been imitated by the Chinese, and many modern jars\r\nare very like the originals. A very profitable business is done by Malay\r\ntraders, who, for one genuine old jar in their possession, have six or\r\nmore modern jars. The Dyaks are very cautious about paying a large price\r\nfor a doubtful article, but for all that they are often taken in.\r\n\r\nI was at a Dyak house in Saribas, and was shown a jar which a Malay\r\ntrader had brought for sale. A Dyak had decided to buy it, the price had\r\nbeen agreed upon, and the trader was to come on the following day to\r\nreceive it in brass guns, gongs, and money. The Dyaks, on examining the\r\njar more closely, came to the conclusion that it was a modern imitation.\r\nWhen the trader came, he was told that the Dyak had had a bad dream about\r\nthe jar, and so was not prepared to buy it. In talking to an old Dyak\r\nabout it, I was told that to say one had a bad dream was the usual way of\r\nrefusing to buy a jar which seemed of doubtful value.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident happened at Sebetan in Krian when I was there. A\r\nMalay trader, whom we will call “A,” came to a Dyak house with a jar to\r\nsell. “A” was well known, as he lived in his coffee plantation on the\r\nbank of the Krian River. The Dyaks examined the jar and saw many defects\r\nin it, and said so. The next day another Malay trader, whom we will call\r\n“B,” arrived with a jar to sell, but no one in the house seemed inclined\r\nto buy it. “A” and “B” seemed to be quite strangers to one another. “A”\r\nexamined the jar “B” had brought, and then said: “My jar is not a good\r\none; I admit that. But this is a genuine old jar, and worth the eighty\r\ndollars he asks for it. I have not got much money with me; but if anyone\r\nhere will lend me the money, I am quite prepared to pay eighty dollars\r\nfor it.” As “A” was well known, the headman of the house lent him the sum\r\nof money he required to enable him to buy the jar. The money was paid to\r\n“B,” who went off. Then “A” began to boast about his bargain; he dwelt\r\non all the good points of the jar, and told the Dyaks that they were\r\nvery foolish to have let such a chance slip. He praised the jar so much\r\nthat the headman of the house said he would buy it from him for the same\r\nprice as he paid for it. “A” said he did not want to part with it, as it\r\nwas a genuine old jar, and honestly worth much more than he gave for it.\r\nAfter some discussion “A” agreed to sell it to the Dyak for one hundred\r\ndollars, and so he made a profit of twenty dollars in a very short time.\r\n\r\nIt was found out afterwards that “B” was living with “A” during his stay\r\nin Krian! The jar was considered by experts to be a modern imitation and\r\ncomparatively worthless. When “A” was spoken to about the matter, he\r\npersisted in saying that in his opinion the jar was a genuine old one,\r\nbut that he might be mistaken.\r\n\r\nWith regard to land, it has been the immemorial custom of the Dyaks that\r\nwhen a person fells the virgin forest he acquires by that act a perpetual\r\ntitle to the land. He may sell it, lend it, let it, or leave it to his\r\nsuccessor. The rent he is supposed to demand for a piece of land large\r\nenough to be farmed by one man is one dollar. If, however, he is not\r\npaid in money, he may claim a game-cock, or two plates. As a gamecock\r\nor two plates cost about a quarter of a dollar, it is dearer to pay for\r\nthe use of land with money. Land disputes are very common among Dyaks. As\r\nthey often leave a particular district, and then return again after many\r\nyears, it is not surprising that complications arise.\r\n\r\nFruit-trees are owned by the people who plant them. The different\r\nfamilies in a Dyak house plant fruit-trees near their part of the house.\r\nWhen they leave the spot and build a new habitation elsewhere, they\r\neach still claim ownership of the trees they planted. The rule with\r\nregard to fruit-trees is that anyone may take the ripe fruit that has\r\nfallen, but only the owner or someone deputed by him may climb the tree.\r\nBanting Hill, where I lived for some years, was covered with fruit-trees\r\n(_durian_), and at night during the fruit season crowds of men and boys\r\nwould watch for the falling of the ripe fruit. They would each have a\r\ntorch made of the bark of some tree, and they would sit and wait with\r\nthe torch smouldering by their side. As soon as a ripe _durian_ fruit\r\nwas heard to fall, they would wave their torches in the air to make them\r\nflare up into a flame, and they would rush to the spot, and the person\r\nwho found the fruit would take possession of it.\r\n\r\nSlavery exists among the Dyaks, but not to any great extent. There are\r\ntwo classes of slaves—captives in war, and slaves for debt.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks when on the warpath spare neither man, women, nor children,\r\nbut it occasionally happens that when they are able to do so, they carry\r\nlittle children back with them as captives. There are not many slaves\r\nto be met with among the Sea Dyaks, and these do not seem to be hardly\r\ntreated. The slaves are not distinguishable from their masters and\r\nmistresses, and they live all together and fare precisely the same, very\r\noften eating the same food at the same time from the same dish. In many\r\ncases children who have been taken captive become so endeared to their\r\nmasters that they are adopted, and intermarry with the sons and daughters\r\nof the other inhabitants of the village.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of adoption is usually performed at a great feast, so that\r\nthe matter may be made as public as possible. The owner of the slave\r\nannounces to the assembled guests that he has freed him and adopted him\r\nas his brother. He then presents to him a spear, with which he is told to\r\nslay the man who dares in future to call him a slave.\r\n\r\nThe old Dyak law concerning debts was that if a man borrowed paddy or\r\nrice from another, he must pay double that amount at the next harvest.\r\nIf therefore a debtor had a succession of bad harvests, his debt would\r\nbecome so great that he could not ever hope to pay it off. If he paid\r\npart of his debt, then the following year he would be expected to pay\r\ndouble the amount still due. In process of time his debt would become so\r\ngreat that he and his family would have to become slaves in payment of it.\r\n\r\nAccording to old Dyak laws people who were careless enough to set a house\r\non fire rendered themselves liable to become the slaves of those who were\r\nburnt out. The damage done by their carelessness would be too great for\r\nthem to compensate, so they would become slaves for debt.\r\n\r\nSir James Brooke made a law that after a certain number of years all\r\nslaves for debt were to be set free, so at present there are not any,\r\nexcept those who have grown old in the service of their masters, and do\r\nnot wish for their freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCHILD-BIRTH AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\n    The Couvade among the Dyaks—Harm to the child—Ways of\r\n    evading these restrictions—Punishment for violating these\r\n    restrictions—A Christian woman’s ideas on the subject—Witch\r\n    doctors and their methods—The waving of a fowl—Treatment of\r\n    the mother and child—Infanticide—Bathing the child—Ceremony\r\n    for insuring happiness to the child—Naming the child—Change of\r\n    name—Children—Toys—Smallness of families—Reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Sea Dyaks look upon child-birth as a very ordinary event, there\r\nare not many ceremonies connected with it, though there are many rules\r\nand restrictions which have to be observed by the parents before the\r\nchild is born.\r\n\r\nThe Couvade is in existence among the Sea Dyaks, and there are many\r\nsuperstitions which impede and harass those who are about to become\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nWhen it is known that a woman is _enceinte_, the following restrictions,\r\nbinding on both husband and wife, come into force, and have to be\r\nobserved until the child has cut its first teeth. The parents may not\r\ncut creepers that hang over the water or over the path, lest the mother\r\nshould suffer from hæmorrhage after delivery. They may not cut anything\r\nin the shape of cloth, cotton, etc., nor lay hold of the handle of a\r\nknife or chopper, nor bind up anything into a parcel; nor may they dam a\r\nstream to set up a fish-trap, or plait the rattan for fixing the adze.\r\nThey must under no circumstances tie up anything with a string, or drive\r\na nail into a board. Neither parent may eat anything while in the act of\r\nwalking. If the neighbour in the next room should hand anything through\r\nthe small window in the partition wall, the hand that receives it must\r\nnot be passed through the window, so as to be on the other side in the\r\nnext room, but must be kept on its own side of the wall. The man may\r\nnot nail up a wall or fasten together the planks of a boat. Nor must\r\nhe plant a post in the earth, nor dig a trench. Plaiting a basket or\r\nmat-work must not be done by the woman. It is unfortunate if the cord of\r\nthe water-gourd, used by the women, break when carrying water, but in\r\ncase of such an accident, evil consequences may be averted if the woman\r\nstep astride over the gourd or other vessel three times backwards and\r\nforwards. To do any of these forbidden things would hinder the wife’s\r\nparturition.\r\n\r\nThere are many prohibitions which, if disregarded by the parents, would\r\nresult in some harm to the child. They must not pour out oil, lest the\r\nchild should suffer from inflammation of the ears; or fix the sword\r\n(_duku_) in its hilt, lest the child be deaf; or break an egg, lest the\r\nchild be blind; or plant a banana-tree, lest the head of the child should\r\nbe abnormally large; or kill any animal, lest the child be deformed or\r\nits nose bleed; or scrape the shell of a cocoanut, lest the child’s hair\r\nshould not grow. It is also forbidden to eat anything in a mosquito\r\ncurtain, lest the child should be still-born; to carry stones, lest the\r\nchild should be paralyzed; to bend into a circle any piece of wood, lest\r\nthe child should not prosper.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many other matters of a similar sort forbidden, but\r\nin the case of nearly all their restrictions, there are ways by which\r\nthey can be circumvented, and no evil effects follow. For instance, the\r\nmother may do basket-work and make mats, provided some other woman begin\r\nthe work for her, and the man may dig trenches or erect a hut provided\r\nthe hands of others are first laid to it. A man may not kill an animal\r\nyet, if he does kill anything, and runs away and then returns a few\r\nminutes afterwards, and makes some remark like this aloud, “I wonder who\r\nkilled this animal?” he has nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nThese curious restrictions are more or less similar among the different\r\ntribes. It is probable that they are founded on some theory of sympathy.\r\nMan, woman, and unborn or newborn babe are all linked together by some\r\nunseen bond, and, accordingly, the wrong action of one may result in harm\r\nto the others.\r\n\r\nThe whole period of a woman’s pregnancy is passed in fear lest the\r\nspirits (_antu_) should do harm to her or her unborn babe. If the mother\r\nhas a bad dream or hears a bird of ill omen, at once a fowl is sacrificed\r\nto propitiate the spirits.\r\n\r\nShould the husband wilfully violate any of the restrictions, the wife’s\r\nrelations immediately bring him to justice, and, according to Dyak law,\r\nhe has to pay a fine.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Bishop Hose, accompanied by a missionary, visited\r\nGinsurai, one of the villages in the Saribas. The Christians there had\r\nbuilt for themselves a small chapel, where services were held. In the\r\nevening, when the Dyaks were sitting together in the _ruai_ of the Dyak\r\nhouse talking to the Bishop and his companion, the question arose as to\r\nwhether the attending of public worship should be included among the many\r\nrestrictions imposed upon a pregnant woman. The wife of the headman in\r\nthe house was a great invalid, and she gave her opinion on the matter.\r\n“I think,” she said, “a woman in that state should be allowed to come to\r\npublic worship. It is just the time she needs it most. You men have so\r\nmuch to engage your attention, and go out to your work. I am an invalid,\r\nand am left at home ill. I often go by myself into our little chapel and\r\nsay the Lord’s Prayer, and I find it is a great consolation to me. A\r\npregnant woman, who is perhaps feeling ill and low-spirited, ought to be\r\nallowed to join in public prayers.” Not so very long after she spoke in\r\nthis way this woman, Manja’s wife, died. Let us hope that there are many\r\nothers in Borneo who, like herself, have learnt to rely on a Higher Power\r\nin time of need.\r\n\r\nWhen the time of delivery is near, and the woman is in travail, two or\r\nthree older women come in and attend to her.\r\n\r\nShould any difficulty occur in the delivery of the child the _manangs_,\r\nor witch-doctors, are called in. One takes charge of the proceedings\r\nin the lying-in room, while the others remain outside in the _ruai_,\r\nor common veranda. The _manang_ inside the room winds a loop of cloth\r\naround the woman above the womb. One of the _manangs_ outside wraps his\r\nbody around in the same manner, but first places within the folds of a\r\ncloth a large stone. A long incantation is then sung by the _manangs_\r\noutside, while the one within the room strives to force the child\r\ndownward, and so hasten delivery. If he succeed in doing this, he draws\r\ndown upon it the loop of cloth, and twists it tightly around the mother’s\r\nbody, so as to prevent the upward return of the child. A shout from him\r\nproclaims his success to his companions outside, and the _manang_ who is\r\npersonating the mother moves the loop of cloth which contains the stone\r\nand encircles his body a stage downwards, in imitation of what has been\r\ndone to the mother in the room. So the matter proceeds until the child is\r\nborn, or until all concerned become assured of the fruitlessness of their\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Dyak mothers, difficulties of this sort seldom occur.\r\nDelivery is generally very easy. The mother may often be seen sitting up\r\nwith her back to the fire half an hour after her child is born, looking\r\nnone the worse for what she has gone through, and before a week she will\r\nprobably be back at her work as usual.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the child is born, a signal is given either by beating a\r\nbamboo with a stick or by striking a brass gong to announce the event.\r\nThen a fowl is waved over the heads of all present, including the infant\r\nand his mother. The fowl is killed and the blood smeared on the foreheads\r\nof those present. It is afterwards cooked and eaten by the parents of the\r\nchild and any friends that may be present.\r\n\r\nThe mother has a poultice of ground ginger placed on her abdomen, and is\r\nbandaged and made to sit up with her back to the fire, and she is given\r\nan unlimited amount of ginger-tea to drink. Her poultice is changed once\r\na day. The infant is washed, and a compound of betel-nut and pepper leaf,\r\nwhich has been chewed in the mouth, is placed on its stomach, and a\r\nbinder tied round it. It is then made to lie on the spathe of a betel-nut\r\npalm, a cloth is put round it, and a Dyak sheet hung over it.\r\n\r\nUntil a civilized Government interfered to prevent such atrocious\r\nmurders, there used to be a custom among the Dyaks that, if the mother\r\ndied in giving birth to her child, the babe should pay the penalty and\r\nbe buried with the mother. The reasons given by them for this cruel act\r\nbeing, that it was the cause of the mother’s death, and that there was\r\nno one to nurse and care for it. No woman would dare to suckle such an\r\norphan, lest it should bring misfortune upon her own children. Therefore\r\nthe poor child was very often placed alive in the coffin with the dead\r\nmother, and both were buried together. This was the old Dyak custom, but\r\nit is a long time since it has been carried out. I have myself known many\r\ncases among the Dyaks when, the mother having died in child-birth, the\r\norphan has been adopted and brought up by some friend or relative.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three days the child receives its bath in a wooden\r\nvessel in the house, but on the fourth day it is taken to the river.\r\nSome ceremonies attend its first bath in the river. An old man of some\r\nstanding, who has been successful in all he has undertaken, is asked to\r\nbathe the child. He wades into the river holding the child in his arms.\r\nA fowl is killed on the bank, a wing is cut off, and if the child be a\r\nboy, this wing is stuck upon a spear, and if a girl, it is fixed to the\r\nshuttle used to pass between the threads in weaving, and this is erected\r\non the bank, and the blood allowed to drop into the stream as an offering\r\nto propitiate the spirits supposed to inhabit the waters, and to insure\r\nthat, at any rate, no accident by water shall happen to the child. The\r\nremainder of the fowl is taken back to the house, cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\nAt some period after the child’s birth—it may be within a few weeks, or\r\nit may be deferred for years—a ceremony is gone through in which the\r\ngods are invoked to grant the child health and wealth, and success in\r\nall his undertakings. The ceremony is generally postponed for some years\r\nif the parents are poor, in order to enable them to save a little to pay\r\nfor the entertainment of their friends and relations on the occasion.\r\nWhere the parents are better off, the ceremony is held a few weeks after\r\nthe birth of the child. Several witch-doctors are asked to take part in\r\nthis performance. A portion of the long open veranda of the Dyak house\r\nis screened off by large, hand-woven Dyak sheets (_puah_), and within\r\nthese the mother sits with her child in her arms. The medicine men walk\r\nround and round, singing some incantation. Generally there is a leader,\r\nwho sings by himself for a few minutes; then he pauses, and turns round\r\nto his followers, and they all sing in chorus. Then the leader sings by\r\nhimself again, and so on. They all walk round, first turning their feet\r\nto the right and stamping on the floor, then pausing a moment and turning\r\ntheir feet to the left, still stamping. This ceremony begins in the\r\nevening, and goes on for several hours. When it is over, food is brought\r\nout to the assembled guests, and all partake of the provided feast.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings differ very much according to the wealth and standing\r\nof the parents. Among the poor it is a very quiet affair—two or three\r\nwitch-doctors attend, and only the near relatives of the child are\r\npresent. On the other hand, among those who are rich, this ceremony is\r\nmade the occasion of holding a great feast, and inviting people from all\r\nparts to attend. Pigs and fowls are killed for food. Jars of _tuak_ (a\r\nspirit obtained from rice) are brought forth for the guests to drink, and\r\nall are invited to rejoice with the parents.\r\n\r\nThe naming of the child is not made the occasion for any ceremonies, and\r\nit is not unusual to meet children of seven or eight years old who have\r\nnot yet received a name. They are known by some pet name, or are called\r\n_endun_ (little girl), or _igat_, or _anggat_ (little boy).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK CHILDREN\r\n\r\nThe figure on the right is a boy, the other five are girls. The children\r\nare fond of games, and are generally expert swimmers, but they have to\r\nmake themselves useful, and help their parents very early in life. Dyak\r\nparents are very kind to their children, who, as a rule, return the\r\naffection, and do as they are told from a desire to please them.]\r\n\r\nEven when a name is given to a child, it is often changed for some reason\r\nor other. The Dyaks have a great objection to uttering the name of a dead\r\nperson, so if the namesake of a child dies, at once a new name is chosen.\r\nAgain, if a child is liable to frequent attacks of illness, it is no\r\nuncommon thing for parents to change the name two or three times in the\r\ncourse of a year. The reason for this is that all sickness and death is\r\nsupposed to be caused by evil spirits, who are put off the scent by this\r\nmeans. When they come to take the child’s soul away, they do not hear his\r\nold name uttered any more, and so they conclude he no longer exists, and\r\nreturn without him!\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very fond of children, and treat them very kindly. They\r\nrarely, if ever, punish them. The children have a great deal of liberty,\r\nbut are not often unruly, disobedient, or disrespectful. They are, as a\r\nrule, very fond of their parents, and when they grow older, do as they\r\nare told from a desire to please them.\r\n\r\nThe girls like to help their mothers in the work of the house, and become\r\nuseful at an early age. The boys also begin to work early, and are often\r\nseen accompanying their fathers when they work on their farms. A boy is\r\nvery proud when he has succeeded in making his first dug-out canoe, which\r\nhe sometimes does at fifteen. He can at this age join a party working in\r\nthe jungle and collecting gutta-percha, canes, and other jungle produce,\r\nand he receives an equal share with the adult members of the party. The\r\nboys generally bring back what money they earn in this way, and give it\r\nto their parents.\r\n\r\nDyak children have not many toys. Little girls are sometimes seen with\r\nrudely carved wooden dolls, and little boys play with models of boats.\r\nThe boys are fond of spinning-tops, which they make for themselves.\r\n\r\nThough the Dyaks marry young, they do not have large families. It is not\r\noften that one meets a family of over three or four children, and I have\r\nonly known of one case where a woman had seven children. The conditions\r\nare favourable, one would think, to a rapid increase of population. They\r\nhave plenty of good plain food, and the climate is healthy. There are\r\nnone of the principal checks to population mentioned by Malthus among\r\nsavage nations—starvation, disease, war, infanticide, or immorality.\r\nWhat, then, is the cause of the small number of births? Climate and race\r\nmay have something to do with it, but I think the main cause of it is the\r\ninfertility of the women. This is no doubt brought about by the hard work\r\nthey do, and the heavy loads they often carry. A Dyak woman sometimes\r\nspends the whole day in the field, and carries home at night a heavy\r\nload, often walking for several miles over hilly paths. In addition to\r\nthis, she has to pound the rice, a work which strains every muscle of the\r\nbody. I have often been told by Dyak women that the hardest work they\r\nhave to do is this rice-pounding. This kind of hard labour begins at an\r\nearly age, and never ceases until the woman is too old or too weak to\r\nwork. Need we wonder, then, at the limited number of her children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMY SCHOOL IN THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n    Up-country mission schools—Education—The Saribas Dyaks eager to\r\n    learn—School programme—What the boys were taught—Some schoolboy\r\n    reminiscences—A youthful Dyak _manang_—The story of Buda—The\r\n    opening of the Krian Mission and the Saribas Mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I want to say something about the little school of Dyak\r\nboys I had in the up-country mission station in my charge. My school\r\nwas a very small one. The largest number of boarders I ever had was\r\nsixteen. It would seem hardly necessary to devote a whole chapter to it,\r\nbut the up-country school is an important factor for good, and deserves\r\nencouragement. I should like to see more of these schools in different\r\nparts of the country. I feel sure that it does a Dyak boy a great deal\r\nof good to be a few years in one of these small schools under the\r\npersonal supervision of the missionary in charge. Here he would do much\r\nmanual work, just as he would do in his own home, and he would at the\r\nsame time be taught moral truths as well as general knowledge. When he\r\nreturns to his Dyak home, he is sure to influence his people for good.\r\nThe object of education is to build up character. The way to improve the\r\nDyaks is not to educate a certain number of them to earn their living\r\nelsewhere, but to take some young people from the Dyak village, improve\r\nthem by implanting in their minds right ideas, and then send them back\r\nto live with their own people the ordinary work-a-day life of the Dyak.\r\nI agree with those who say that to place Dyak boys in one of the larger\r\nschools in Kuching for any length of time will make a return to their old\r\nsurroundings distasteful to them, and unfit them for the ordinary life\r\nand occupations of their people. And therefore I think that only those\r\nwho show a special aptitude to become teachers should be sent on to the\r\nschool at the capital to be taught to read and write English. A certain\r\nnumber of clerks are needed, but that number is very limited, and to\r\nproduce a large number of Dyak clerks for whom there is not sufficient\r\nwork is surely a mistake. There are some who advocate technical education\r\nfor the Dyak. No doubt he would with training make an excellent carpenter\r\nor smith, but again he would find difficulty in getting work. He would\r\nnever be able to compete with the Chinese artisan into whose hands all\r\nthe skilled labour has fallen.\r\n\r\nThe main object of my school in the jungle was to teach Dyak boys for a\r\nfew years, and then send them back to their own people. Unfortunately, I\r\nhad not the means to carry this out to any great extent.\r\n\r\nA few of my schoolboys, after being with me for some time, were sent on\r\nto the larger school at Kuching to be taught English. These were the boys\r\nwho one hoped would in after years become teachers and catechists. There\r\nis so little Dyak literature that it is necessary that a person learn\r\nEnglish so as to be able to educate himself by reading English books. But\r\nthe majority of my boys stayed with me for two, three, or four years,\r\nand then returned to their Dyak homes. In my school there was manual\r\nwork as well as lessons to do. They lived plainly, cooking their own\r\nfood and doing most of their own work. They were cut away from all the\r\nsuperstitious customs of their people, and received a certain amount of\r\nmoral and religious training. After three or four years of such school\r\nlife they were ready to return to their old surroundings, taking with\r\nthem the lessons they had learnt.\r\n\r\nFor the present, at any rate, there is no need for the Dyak to take up\r\nnew industries. What he wants is to be taught to do the work he has to\r\ndo more thoroughly, and to be released from the bondage of superstition\r\nand the constant fear of evil spirits in which he lives. The problem of\r\nhis future will work itself out by a natural process. When the present\r\nsources of supply fail him, necessity will force him to take up new\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nMy schoolboys came from different Dyak villages, but the majority of\r\nthem were boys from Saribas. The Dyaks of that district are more anxious\r\nto improve themselves than other Dyak races. The following incident\r\nwill show how keen they are to learn to read. A party of Saribas Dyaks\r\ngoing on a gutta-hunting expedition asked for a copy of the first Dyak\r\nreading-book, because one of them could read, and thought he would teach\r\nthe others in the evenings when they were not at work. And this is indeed\r\nwhat did happen, and when the party returned most of them were able to\r\nread. The Saribas women are just as keen as the men, and many of them\r\nhave been taught to read by some Dyak friend. I have myself noticed, when\r\nholding services for the Christians in some villages in Saribas, how many\r\nof those present were able to use the Dyak Prayer-Book and follow the\r\nservice and read the responses.\r\n\r\nA Dyak schoolmaster, who had taught in Banting for many years, afterwards\r\nworked as the Government clerk at Betong in Saribas. He told me that\r\nhe was struck by the number of Dyak men and women in Saribas who could\r\nwrite, and how they often wrote letters to their friends who were away,\r\nand received letters from them.\r\n\r\nThe school programme for the day was as follows:\r\n\r\n5.45 _a.m._—The two boys whose turn it was to cook, and the two boys\r\nwhose turn it was to sweep out the school-room and the lower room of the\r\nMission House, would get up and begin their duties.\r\n\r\n6.30 _a.m._—A gong would be struck telling the boys to come to breakfast.\r\nThey would all go to the kitchen and have their meal, consisting of rice\r\nwith a little salt fish or vegetables.\r\n\r\n7 _a.m._—The boys would be told what manual work they had to do: either\r\nthey would weed the paths, or cut the grass, or work at their different\r\nvegetable gardens. Sometimes they would go out into the jungle to get\r\nfirewood. At Temudok, where the soil was good, the schoolboys had\r\nexcellent vegetable gardens.\r\n\r\n8.30 _a.m._—A gong would be struck to let them know they were to stop\r\nworking and have a bath, after which, at 8.45 _a.m._, there would be a\r\nshort service.\r\n\r\n9-11 _a.m._—Morning school.\r\n\r\n12 _noon_.—Midday meal.\r\n\r\n2-4 _p.m._—Afternoon school.\r\n\r\n5 _p.m._—Evensong, to which some of the Dyaks from the village would come.\r\n\r\n6 _p.m._—Evening meal.\r\n\r\n7-8 _p.m._—Preparation for next day’s lessons.\r\n\r\n9 _p.m._—Two or three short prayers and one verse of a children’s evening\r\nhymn, after which the boys would go to bed.\r\n\r\nOn Saturdays there was no school. The boys did their washing on that day,\r\nand often went into the jungle for firewood, but they had most of the day\r\nfor play.\r\n\r\nThe children were taught to read and write Dyak, and a little arithmetic.\r\nThey were also taught the elements of the Christian religion. They were\r\nalways encouraged to ask the schoolmaster or myself any questions they\r\nliked. I have learned from conversations I had with my boys what were the\r\nspecial points in Christianity that needed explanation to Dyaks. Living\r\nwith me as they did, I got to know my boys very well, and through them I\r\nlearnt to know their parents and friends. They did not have many lessons\r\nto learn; there was plenty of time for play and work. It was not so\r\nmuch what they learnt from books that did the boys good, as their being\r\nseparated for a time from the customs and superstitions of the Dyaks.\r\nWe have had many instances of families becoming Christian through some\r\nchildren of theirs coming to school.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys in the school were Christians, but all, whether\r\nChristians or not, attended the services and were taught about God. Some\r\nof the bigger heathen boys, after being in the school some time, have\r\nasked to be baptized.\r\n\r\nThe following schoolboy reminiscences may be of interest to my readers:—\r\n\r\nWhen I was visiting the different villages in the Saribas River and\r\nteaching the people in the evening in the public hall of the Dyak house,\r\nvery often some boys would say they would like to join my school. Then I\r\nwould speak to their parents, and if they agreed to it these boys would\r\ngo back with me on my return to the Mission House and attend my school.\r\n\r\nI must relate an incident which occurred when I was stationed at Temudok\r\non the Krian River. I paid my usual quarterly visit to Saribas, and when\r\nI was at Stambak a boy named Usat, about twelve years old, said he would\r\nlike to attend my school. In the evening, when we were seated on mats in\r\nthe public part of the house, the headman, who was a great warrior, and\r\nhad a very gruff manner, said to me:—\r\n\r\n“I hear you are thinking of taking Usat to your school. His brother is\r\nhere, but he is a fool and cannot speak, so I will speak for him. I\r\nshould not advise you to take Usat. He is a bad boy, and never obeys his\r\nelders. Why, one day he took a knife and wanted to attack me! Of course,\r\nif you wish to take a boy of that kind with you, you can, but I have\r\nwarned you.”\r\n\r\nUsat was himself present and heard all this, but said nothing. I said\r\nto him: “If you come with me to school you must do what you are told; I\r\ndon’t want disobedient boys.” He made no reply.\r\n\r\nLater on in the evening, when I was returning to my boat, I heard a\r\npattering of feet behind me on the log which formed the path. Turning\r\nround, I saw it was Usat, who had followed me, and wanted to say\r\nsomething to me.\r\n\r\n“If you take me with you,” he said, “I will do as I am told.”\r\n\r\nI liked his looks, as he seemed bright and intelligent, so I told him I\r\nwould call for him in about ten days’ time, when I had visited the other\r\nSaribas villages, and was on my way back to Temudok, and if his parents\r\nconsented to his going to school, he could accompany me.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me on my return from up-river, and I took him in my\r\nboat to Temudok, where he soon made friends with the other boys. He was\r\nfull of fun and mischief, but very frank and open, and we all liked him\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nAfter he had been with me about three weeks, four Dyaks came overland\r\nfrom Stambak. They said they had been sent by Usat’s parents and friends,\r\nwho felt certain that the boy must have given a great deal of trouble,\r\nand that I was anxious to get rid of him, and so they had come to fetch\r\nhim home. I told them the boy was happy enough, and that I did not want\r\nto send him back, so they returned without him. I do not know what they\r\nsaid about the boy, but, anyhow, he was allowed to stay at my school for\r\nover two years, when his parents wished him to return to help them in\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nA little boy from Seblak, a branch of the Krian River, came to me\r\nat Temudok, and asked to be admitted into my school. There were no\r\nChristians in the village where he lived, but his brother, who was in the\r\nGovernment employ at Kabong as a fortman, had heard of my school. Belawan\r\nwas not a particularly sharp boy, but he was very strong for his age and\r\na very good wrestler. Nothing gave him greater pleasure than to wrestle\r\nand beat a boy older than himself. He stayed at my school a little over\r\ntwo years. I have never done any missionary work on the Seblak River,\r\nbut I am glad Belawan came to my school, because I learnt from him what\r\nabsurd ideas the people at Seblak had of the missionary and the Mission\r\nHouse. One thing he said was that there was a general idea among some of\r\nthe people that I had a roomful of _antu_ (evil spirits) in the Mission\r\nHouse, and he said that was one reason why for a long time he hesitated\r\nabout joining the school at Temudok! Seblak is rather out of the usual\r\nbeat, and the Dyaks there do not come into contact with missionaries, and\r\nI was not at all surprised that the people of that district should have\r\nabsurd ideas. I hope later on, when missionary work is begun in Seblak,\r\nthe fact that Belawan stayed for two years in my house will have helped\r\nto pave the way for a kind reception of the missionary.\r\n\r\nI was once returning to Temudok from a visit to the Saribas River, and\r\nas usual had in my boat a few Dyak schoolboys who had been on a visit to\r\ntheir friends at Saribas. We had had a tiring day, and my boat got to\r\nKabong—the mouth of the Krian River—at about 7 p.m. The boatmen had not\r\nhad their evening meal, and everybody was tired and hungry. I was going\r\nto spend the night at the Fort, so the men and boys carried from the boat\r\nsuch things as I might require. When everything I needed had been brought\r\nto the Fort, one of the schoolboys, Saran, said to me:—\r\n\r\n“There is a Malay boy on the beach who says he would like to fight me. If\r\nyou give me leave, I should be glad to fight him.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want to fight for at this hour?” I said. “You are all tired\r\nand hungry. The best thing for you to do is to have your dinner.”\r\n\r\n“The Malay boy was very cheeky,” Saran went on to say; “he shook his\r\nfist at me, and said I was afraid of him. I should like to give him a\r\nthrashing.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said; “go and fight him if you like, but don’t come back\r\nwhining to me and say you are hurt.”\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour afterwards Saran returned very pleased with himself.\r\nIt seems that when the Malay boy saw Saran meant business, he took to\r\nhis heels, and my schoolboy had the pleasure of chasing him to the Malay\r\nvillage. Though he did not have his fight, he had the pleasure of feeling\r\nhe had defeated the enemy. I mention this little incident to show how\r\nvery much like other boys the Dyaks are, and how my schoolboy was ready\r\nfor a fight even though he was tired and hungry.\r\n\r\nWhen stationed at Temudok, I used to visit the Christians on the Budu\r\nRiver—a branch of the Krian River—and I had there a little native-built\r\nhut, where I used to live for a week or so. The boys and girls there were\r\nvery anxious to learn, so I got some slates for them. In the evenings\r\nthere used to be about a dozen boys and girls in my room learning to read\r\nand write. It was amusing to see what they did when they wanted a slate\r\npencil. They would go to the shingly bed of the river a few yards away,\r\nand pick up a long thin bit of slate, and rub it against some other stone\r\ntill it was the right shape to be used as a pencil.\r\n\r\nOne day I went with my Catechist, Tujoh, and two schoolboys, who had\r\naccompanied me from my Mission School at Temudok, overland to a long\r\nDyak house higher up the Budu River. A boy about fourteen years old\r\nwas pointed out to me there, and I was told that he was a _manang_, or\r\nwitch-doctor. I had never seen anybody as young as that acting as a\r\n_manang_, and knowing what a great deal of deceit is practised by the\r\nDyak witch-doctor, there was to me something very sad in the thought of\r\nthis young boy doing such work. I was also curious to know what led him\r\nto become a _manang_, so I spoke to him, and told him that if he cared to\r\npay a visit to Temudok, or to come to school there, he would be welcome.\r\nAfter some little discussion, his parents allowed him to come with me\r\non a visit, and later on the boy, whose name was Ambu, was allowed to\r\nattend my school. I found out from him that he understood very little of\r\nthe doings of the witch-doctors. There were very few _manangs_ near his\r\nvillage, and there was a difficulty in getting more than two or three to\r\ntake part in their ceremonies over the sick, so Ambu was persuaded to\r\njoin them and walk round when incantations were made. While the other\r\nDyak doctors were well paid, Ambu received some trifle for his part in\r\nthe proceedings. Ambu stayed with me nearly a year, and then returned to\r\nhis people. I had a long talk with him before he went back about the work\r\nof the _manangs_. I said that my advice to him was not to have anything\r\nto do with their ceremonies for the next few years. If, when he was old\r\nenough to judge for himself, he still wished to be a _manang_, he could\r\ndo so, but in the meantime he had better follow the advice of one who was\r\nolder than himself, and knew something of the deceit of the _manangs_. I\r\nlost sight of Ambu soon after his return to his people, because the house\r\nwas broken up, and the inmates moved to some distant part.\r\n\r\nI conclude this rambling chapter with the romantic but true story of how\r\none of the most influential native Catechists became a Christian through\r\nseeing the missionary teaching some boys in an up-country Mission School.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK YOUTH\r\n\r\nHe has on an elaborate headkerchief decorated with tassels and small\r\npieces of silver or brass. These headkerchiefs are sometimes woven by the\r\nDyaks themselves, or else they make the border of bright-coloured threads\r\nand sew it round a piece of red or blue imported cloth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK LAD\r\n\r\nOn his head he has a headkerchief which consists of a square piece of\r\ncloth tied in such a manner as to form a cap.]\r\n\r\nBuda was the youngest of the warrior sons of the old Orang Kaya Pemancha,\r\nthe famous pirate and war-leader of the Saribas Dyaks in the old\r\nlawless days. One of his brothers, Haji, was killed fighting against\r\nthe Government forces sent to punish the rebels and restore order in\r\nthe Saribas. Loiyo and Nanang, two other brothers, were at one time\r\nfollowers of Rentap, who held out so long against the Sarawak Government,\r\nand made Sadok Mountain, between the Saribas and the Skrang Rivers, his\r\nheadquarters. The Dyaks often relate with keen interest the story of\r\nthose ancient days when Rentap’s stronghold, high up on Sadok Mountain,\r\nwith precipitous approaches on every side, was considered impregnable.\r\nMany an expedition did the Government lead against Rentap, but to no\r\npurpose. Rentap, who was called by his followers the “Inland Rajah,” and\r\nwas the leader of the opposition to the rule of the Rajah of Sarawak, was\r\nsupported by a large force of disaffected Saribas and Skrang Dyaks, and\r\nwas not to be easily beaten.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, however, Rentap was losing his popularity, and a great many of\r\nhis followers had deserted him. They could not endure the violence and\r\nwilfulness of their leader, and they saw that the Dyaks who had submitted\r\nto Rajah Brooke’s Government were happy and flourishing. Moreover, Rentap\r\nhad offended their Dyak prejudices. He had discarded his old wife, and\r\nmarried one of the girls he had taken captive, and called her “the Ranee\r\nof Sadok.” This was contrary to all Dyak custom, and was greatly resented\r\nby his followers. In that year Loiyo and Nanang, two of Rentap’s leading\r\nwarriors, and their adherents, made their submission to Rajah Brooke.\r\nThey had to give security to the amount of forty valuable jars (worth\r\nabout £500), which were to be retained for three years, and then returned\r\nto their owners should they remain loyal.\r\n\r\nThe next expedition led by the Government succeeded in defeating Rentap.\r\nWhen he found that his stronghold was no longer tenable, he fled with\r\nsuch of his followers as were able, down the opposite side of the\r\nmountain. Deserted by most of his followers, he retired to the Entabai\r\nbranch of the Kanowit River, and died there some years after.\r\n\r\nBuda and his brother Unting, the two other sons of the Orang Kaya\r\nPemancha, did their share of fighting during these troubled times, and\r\ntook part in many a bold deed, to the annoyance of the Government. Unting\r\nmarried and settled at Saribas, and I knew him well. Buda married into a\r\nfamily at Sebetan, and made his home there.\r\n\r\nI have told the history of Buda and his brothers in order to give some\r\nidea of the kind of reputation his family had among the Dyaks. At the\r\ntime of Buda’s visit to Banting, the Rev. W. R. Mesney (afterwards\r\nArchdeacon of Sarawak) was living at Banting with the Rev. Walter\r\nChambers, who became afterwards Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak. Let me give\r\nthe account of what happened in Mr. Mesney’s own words:—\r\n\r\n“Buda had started from his home to visit different places—_belelang_, as\r\nthe Dyaks call it. He had with him a couple of favourite fighting-cocks,\r\nand these he matched against the cocks of the houses he came to in his\r\nwanderings. In this way he came down the Batang Lupar, and reached\r\nBanting, where he knew that a distant connection of his family lived,\r\nand for that house he shaped his course. He made himself known to these\r\nfriends, who welcomed him, and were proud of a visit from the son of the\r\nOrang Kaya Pemancha. He put his fighting-cocks into one of the _kurongs_\r\n(baskets) under the _lantai_ (flooring) of the house, and made his pets\r\nsafe, and then, as it was just the time for the women to begin their\r\nrice-pounding, he dressed himself up, and marched off, and found his way\r\nup the hill to the Mission House.\r\n\r\n“I was just then there alone. Mr. Chambers was gone to visit some of the\r\nout-stations on the Batang Lupar. I was teaching half a dozen small fry\r\nat the table, which stood in what corresponded to the veranda in the old\r\nMission House at Banting. I was not paying any attention to the door,\r\nnor troubling about who came in, as at that time of the day many young\r\nfellows, who were on the hill for any purpose, were in the habit of\r\ncoming in and watching the boys learning. I was busy with a couple of the\r\nyoungsters, when I noticed the others all press up close together, and\r\nbegin whispering and signalling as Dyaks can, and showing unmistakable\r\nsigns of uneasiness. When I saw this, I looked up to see the cause of it,\r\nand there, standing by one of the posts of the house, was a strange man,\r\nvery unlike a Balau in dress and appearance, with his hand on the handle\r\nof his _ilang_ (sword); in fact, behaving in quite a different way to the\r\nordinary Dyak visitor. The boys did not like his manner at all, I could\r\nsee, and I heard them whisper “_munsoh_” (enemy) to each other.\r\n\r\n“I asked the man to sit down, but this he declined to do, for he\r\ncontinued standing there with his eyes fixed on us and his hand on the\r\nhandle of his sword, from the sheath of which a large bunch of charms\r\nwas suspended. I kept my eye on the man, and at the same time went on\r\nteaching. He continued to watch us for some minutes, and the boys got\r\nmore and more uncomfortable. When at last the man actually came up to\r\nthe table and picked up a piece of paper, I thought the boys would have\r\nall bolted. However, after looking at the paper for a few minutes, he\r\nmade some remark, and I again asked him to sit down. This time he did\r\nwhat I asked him to do, and sat down on the floor just where he had\r\nbeen standing. I asked him the usual questions, “_Ari ni nuan?_” (“From\r\nwhere have you come?”) and so on. He soon made some remark about the\r\npaper he had picked up, and we talked to each other. In the midst of our\r\nconversation, he suddenly got up and went to the door, where he proceeded\r\nto take off his sword and the great bunch of charms that he was wearing\r\nat his waist, and placed them very carefully down on the floor just\r\noutside the door, as he could not find anything to hang them up to. He\r\ncame back, and this time took his seat on the form at the table. I went\r\non for a short time longer teaching the boys, and then began talking to\r\nmy visitor. He was very much interested, and said that he should like to\r\nhear more; might he come again when the boys were being taught? After he\r\nhad gone, I heard who he was, and what he had come to Banting for.\r\n\r\n“The next day he made his appearance again, and sat and listened while\r\nthe boys had their lesson. The reading was the attraction to him, and he\r\nsaid that he would like to be able to read; might he stay at Banting,\r\nand come up to the Mission House for lessons? And so it came about that\r\nwhen Mr. Chambers returned, he walked into the Mission House, and found\r\nme with the redoubtable Buda, seated and quietly learning his A B C! Mr.\r\nChambers, of course, knew the man well by reputation, and he took me\r\naside, and asked me if I knew his character, and what he had done in the\r\npast. I could only say that I had gathered from the behaviour of other\r\npeople that he was well-known, but that I had had no cause to complain of\r\nhis behaviour during the few days he had been at Banting and coming to\r\nthe Mission House. When Mr. Chambers found the man was amenable, he was\r\nglad to have him at Banting, and Buda devoted himself to learning, and\r\nwas quite a pattern scholar.”\r\n\r\nFrom this account it will be seen that Buda was first induced to take\r\nlessons by seeing Dyak boys being taught at an up-country Mission School.\r\nAfter a short stay in Banting he went back to his home, but returned\r\nto Banting again for more instruction. He was baptized, and afterwards\r\nworked as Catechist. He accompanied Mr. Chambers to his home in Sebetan,\r\nwhere he had already taught many of the Dyaks, and thus the Krian and\r\nSebetan Mission was started. For many years Buda worked as Catechist at\r\nSebetan under Mr. Perham, afterwards Archdeacon of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWhen returning from one of his visits to Sebetan, Mr. Chambers persuaded\r\nBuda to come back to Banting and bring his wife and child with him, so\r\nthat she might get more instruction. While at Banting on that occasion,\r\nBuda proposed to Mr. Mesney that he should go with him to the Saribas,\r\nand see whether they could not influence some of his relatives there in\r\nthe Gospel message. Mr. Chambers hesitated for some time, because the\r\nBalaus of Banting distrusted the Saribas Dyaks, who used to be their\r\nenemies. But at last he said that, if Mr. Mesney was bold enough to visit\r\nthe Saribas Dyaks, and could get men to accompany him, he might do so.\r\nThere was some difficulty in getting the men, but this was overcome, and\r\nMr. Mesney, accompanied by Buda and some Banting Dyaks, paid a visit to\r\nSaribas. That was the beginning of the Saribas Mission, which at the\r\npresent time is the most successful and encouraging of all the missions\r\nin Sarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE\r\n\r\n    Courtship—Discussion where the married couple are to live—The\r\n    fetching of the bride—The wedding ceremony—_Mlah Pinang_—Visit\r\n    of bride to her mother-in-law—Bride’s dress—Bridegroom—Old\r\n    bachelors among the Dyaks—Age of marriage—Monogamy—Prohibitive\r\n    degrees—Dyak view of marriage—Conjugal affection—Mischief-making\r\n    mothers-in-law—Separation and reconciliation—Divorce—Adultery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mode of courtship among the Dyaks is peculiar. No courting goes on by\r\nday, but at night, when all is quiet, a young lover creeps to the side of\r\nthe curtain of his lady-love, and awakes her. The girls sleep apart from\r\ntheir parents—sometimes in the same room, but more often in the loft.\r\nHe presents her with a roll of _sireh_ leaf, in which is wrapped the\r\nbetel-nut ingredients the Dyaks love to chew.\r\n\r\nIf, when awakened, the girl accepts the betel-nut roll which the young\r\nman presents her, and puts it in her mouth, it is a sign that his visit\r\nis acceptable, and that he may stay and speak to her. If, on the other\r\nhand, she says, “Please blow up the fire,” or “Be good enough to light\r\nthe lamp” (which is usually a bamboo filled with resin), it shows that\r\nshe will have nothing to say to him, and he recognizes the usual form of\r\ndismissal and goes away.\r\n\r\nIf the lover’s visit be acceptable to her, they chew _sireh_ and\r\nbetel-nut, a plentiful supply of which the man brings with him, and make\r\narrangements about the future.\r\n\r\nThis nocturnal visiting goes on for some weeks. If the parents of the\r\ngirl think the match a suitable one, the young people are permitted to\r\nsee each other very often. On the other hand, if the young man does not\r\nfind favour with them, they soon let him know that his visits are not\r\ndesired. They do not allow their daughter to see him alone, and the\r\nmatter goes no farther.\r\n\r\nThis nightly courtship is, in fact, the only way a man and woman can\r\nbecome acquainted with each other, for such a thing as privacy during the\r\nday is quite unknown in a Dyak house. If the girl be pleased with her\r\nlover, he remains with her until close upon daybreak, when he leaves with\r\nher some article as a pledge of his honour, such as a bead necklace, or\r\nring, or a headkerchief, or anything else which he may have about him.\r\nThis act of leaving some gift with the girl is considered as a betrothal\r\nbetween the two parties, and the man who refuses to marry the girl after\r\ndoing so is considered guilty of breach of promise of marriage, and\r\nliable, according to Dyak law, to a fine.\r\n\r\nI have often spoken to older Dyaks about the matter, and have been told\r\nby them that these nocturnal visits very seldom result in immorality.\r\nThe girl who is not careful how she behaves very soon gets a bad name\r\namong the young men, and all her chances of securing a husband are lost.\r\nAnd it is a fact that, considering the population, there are not many\r\nillegitimate children among the Dyaks.\r\n\r\nWhen the young couple have decided the question of the future to their\r\nmutual satisfaction, the next step in the proceedings is for the man to\r\nmake known his wishes to his own parents, and then a visit is paid by the\r\nman’s relatives and friends to the girl’s parents to request formally\r\nthe hand of their daughter in marriage. This consent is seldom refused,\r\nbecause as a rule the parents of the girl approve of her choice, or they\r\nwould not have allowed her to receive visits from the man.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of discussion, sometimes lasting for days, as to\r\nwhere the married couple are to live after the wedding ceremony. The wife\r\ndoes not always leave her home to go and live with her husband. As often\r\nas not the man takes up his abode in the house of his wife’s relations.\r\nMany matters are taken into consideration in deciding where they are\r\nto live. If the daughter be an only child, her parents generally make\r\nit a condition of marriage, that the son-in-law should come and live\r\nwith them, and work for them, but where the girl has many brothers and\r\nsisters, and the man has not, she is allowed to go and live in his house.\r\nThen, again, the question of social standing comes in, and if a girl\r\nmarries beneath her she refuses to go to the house of her husband, and\r\nexpects him to come to her.\r\n\r\nWhen everything has been satisfactorily arranged, and the consent of\r\nthe girl’s parents has been obtained, a day is fixed for the marriage\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nThe day before the wedding is spent by the bridegroom in obtaining a\r\nplentiful supply of betel-nut, _sireh_ leaf (a species of pepper), lime,\r\ngambier, etc.—all necessary concomitants for the guests to chew during\r\nthe proceedings connected with the marriage ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe wedding may take place either at the house of the bride, or else at\r\nthat of the bridegroom. Generally it is held in the house in which the\r\nnewly married couple do not intend to reside; that is, if it be decided\r\nthat the newly married wife should settle in her husband’s house, then\r\nthe wedding will take place at her home. If, on the other hand, the\r\nrelatives decide that the husband is to live in the home of his wife,\r\nthen the wedding takes place at the house of his parents.\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the ceremony among the Sea Dyaks is the fetching\r\nof the bride from her father’s to the bridegroom’s house. The women-folk\r\nof his village set out in a boat, gaily decorated with an awning of\r\nparti-coloured sheets, and with streamers and flags flying, to an\r\naccompaniment of gongs and drums, and musical instruments, to fetch the\r\nbride to her future husband’s house.\r\n\r\nWhen the other party arrive at the landing-stage of the house at which\r\nthe wedding is to take place, they walk up to the house—a gaily-dressed\r\ncrowd—and sit down in the open veranda, to talk over the future prospects\r\nof the young couple, chewing betel-nut and _sireh_ all the time. A\r\nportion of these chewing ingredients are carefully set aside to be used\r\nlater on. The Dyak, with his great love for divination, cannot allow such\r\nan occasion to pass without making some attempt to penetrate into the\r\nsecrets of the future.\r\n\r\nThe company sit down in the long common room of the Dyak house, and then\r\nare brought forward the betel-nut, _sireh_, etc., specially set aside for\r\nthe ceremony. A betel-nut is split into seven pieces by a man supposed\r\nto be lucky in matrimonial matters, and these, together with the other\r\ningredients of the betel-nut mixture, are all put in a little basket,\r\nwhich is bound together with red cloth and laid for a short time upon the\r\nopen platform adjoining the house.\r\n\r\nThe master of the ceremonies, who splits the betel-nut, generally\r\nan older man of some standing, then makes to the assembled guests\r\nthe declaration that if either party should desert the other without\r\nsufficient reason, the offending party shall be fined to such an amount\r\nas has been already agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe basket containing the split pieces of betel-nut is then brought\r\nin and uncovered, and the contents examined to ascertain the will of\r\nthe gods. Should the pieces of betel-nut by some mystic power increase\r\nin number, the marriage will be an unusually happy one; but should\r\nthey decrease it is a bad omen, and the marriage must be postponed, or\r\nrelinquished altogether. But as a matter of fact, they neither increase\r\nnor decrease, and this is interpreted to mean that the wedding is one\r\nupon which the spirits have pronounced neither a good nor a bad verdict.\r\n\r\nThis action gives the name to the marriage ceremony. The Dyaks call\r\nmarriage _Mlah Pinang_—“splitting the betel-nut.”\r\n\r\nThe contents of the little basket used to discover the will of the higher\r\npowers are chewed just as other _pinang_ and _sireh_, and the marriage\r\nceremony is over; the young couple are lawfully man and wife.\r\n\r\nThe married couple stay for three days in the house which is to be their\r\nfuture home. On the fourth day a visit is paid, lasting for three days,\r\nto the family with whom the alliance has been made. Then the young couple\r\nreturn to settle down in their new home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK WEDDING\r\n\r\nThe bride is seated in the middle with a large filigree silver comb in\r\nher hair. The bridegroom is seated on her right, and her mother on her\r\nleft. The old man on the right is the “Master of Ceremonies.” Before him,\r\ncovered with a native cloth, is the basket containing the pieces of split\r\nbetel-nut, which are examined to see if the marriage will be a happy\r\none.]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the first visit of the bride to the house of her\r\nhusband, she must not enter her mother-in-law’s room, but must be led in\r\neither by that much dreaded relative herself, or by some woman deputed\r\nby her to perform that office. The bride, therefore, goes into the room\r\nof some female friend living in the house, and there awaits the coming of\r\nher mother-in-law; the husband meanwhile sits down on a mat in the open\r\nveranda outside his mother’s room.\r\n\r\nThe lady, having ascertained the whereabouts of her daughter-in-law, goes\r\nand fetches her, and brings her into the room. She bids her sit down on a\r\nmat spread for the purpose. Then she goes out to her son in the veranda,\r\nand leads him in, and tells him to sit by his wife’s side. When they\r\nare seated side by side, the mother waves a live fowl over her son and\r\ndaughter-in-law with a hastily muttered invocation for future health and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe respect that Dyaks are required to pay to the father-in-law and\r\nmother-in-law is far greater than they have to pay to their own parents.\r\n\r\nIt is considered a terrible crime for a man to mention the names of his\r\nwife’s parents, and he dare not disobey their commands. A young man\r\nmarrying an only child and living with her parents has generally a hard\r\ntime of it, because he has to give way in everything to the wishes of his\r\nwife’s parents. In the same way a girl who marries an only son, and lives\r\nwith his parents, has often an unhappy time, being continually ordered\r\nabout and scolded by her mother-in-law. I have known cases where husband\r\nand wife have separated simply because the mother-in-law has made the\r\nlife of the wife unbearable.\r\n\r\nFor the wedding, and for the subsequent visit which the bride pays to her\r\nhusband’s home, she decks herself out in all the finery she possesses\r\nor can borrow from her friends. Her wedding-dress consists of a short\r\npetticoat of Dyak woven cloth which reaches to her knees. Along the\r\nbottom edge of this there are sewed several rows of tinsel and of silver\r\ncoins, below which probably hang some rows of hawk-bells, which make a\r\ntinkling sound as she moves. Round her waist are several coils of brass\r\nor silver chain, and two or three belts made of dollars or other silver\r\ncoins linked together.\r\n\r\nFrom her hips upwards, as far as her armpits, she wears a corset formed\r\nby threading upon split cane a great number of small brass rings,\r\narranged so closely together as completely to hide the cane. To this\r\ncorset may be fixed two or three bands of silver coins. Her armlets of\r\nbrass or silver extend as far up as her elbow. As many rings as she\r\npossesses are on her fingers, and she wears necklaces of small beads,\r\nworked in very beautiful patterns, and finished off with a tassel of\r\nbeads, or else a large number of big silver or brass buttons strung\r\ntogether round her neck. Her ears are decorated with filigreed studs of\r\nsilver gilt, with a setting of scarlet cloth behind the filigree work to\r\nshow them off.\r\n\r\nIn her hair is a towering comb of silver filigree work, to which are\r\nattached a number of silver spangles, which glitter with every movement\r\nof her head. She wears her hair in a knot into which are stuck a number\r\nof large brass hair-pins decorated with beads and little tags of red\r\nand yellow and white cloth. She possesses a bright-coloured jacket of\r\nDyak woven cloth; but she does not wear it; it is slung over her right\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nAfter this detailed description of the bride’s dress, it is disappointing\r\nto learn that the bridegroom takes no special pains to ornament his\r\nperson. The men wear a great deal of finery when they attend a feast, or\r\nwhen they go out on the warpath, but on the occasion of his wedding the\r\nbridegroom takes no extra trouble about his apparel.\r\n\r\nI have been present at a Dyak wedding more than once, and what struck\r\nme most was the perfunctory manner in which everything was done. No one\r\nseemed to listen much to what the Master of Ceremonies had to say; all\r\nsat round talking and laughing as the mood suited them. The examining of\r\nthe basket containing the pieces of split betel-nut was not awaited with\r\nany anxiety. Everything seemed to be done because it was the custom, and\r\nfor no other reason.\r\n\r\nNearly every Sea Dyak is married, and it is very unusual to meet a\r\nbachelor above the age of twenty-five. The exception to this is among the\r\nSkrang Dyaks, among whom one often sees an unmarried man over forty years\r\nof age. The expression _Bujang Skrang_—“a Skrang bachelor”—means an old\r\nbachelor.\r\n\r\nA man rarely marries a woman who has an illegitimate child. But children\r\nare very much desired, and the Dyaks have a great horror of being\r\nchildless. Intercourse often takes place between those who have been\r\nbetrothed, but not formally married, simply to ascertain if the marriage\r\nwill be fruitful. At the first signs of the desired result the marriage\r\nceremony takes place.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes marry at an early age. The young men marry when about eighteen\r\nto twenty years of age, and the girls at sixteen or seventeen, though\r\nsometimes marriage is postponed till later. They frequently separate by\r\nmutual consent, and nothing is thought of it if the couple be childless;\r\nbut it is very seldom that anything of the kind occurs if there are\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dyaks no man has more than one wife. Polygamy is considered\r\nvery displeasing to the gods, and if a man does take to himself two\r\nwives, the other people of the village compel him to give one up, and\r\nsacrifices are offered to the gods and spirits to avert any evil effects\r\nupon the community for the crime.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very particular as to their prohibitive degrees, and are\r\nopposed to the marriage of relatives. The prohibitive degrees are much\r\nthe same as among Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak men view marriage as an arrangement for the mutual convenience\r\nof both parties in order to obtain children. Though there is often a\r\ngreat deal of love between husband and wife, still, when the marriage is\r\nchildless, the Dyak idea is that the proper thing to do is to separate.\r\nI have known many childless couples who have continued to live together,\r\nand have perhaps adopted a child; but they have done so in spite of all\r\nthat has been said to them and in opposition to the wishes of their\r\nfriends. I have often heard Dyaks say: “When you plant a fruit-tree you\r\nexpect it to bear fruit, and when you marry you expect your wife to bear\r\nchildren.”\r\n\r\nThe Dyak women generally regard marriage as a means of obtaining a man\r\nto work for them. A woman will often separate from her husband simply\r\nbecause he is lazy, and will not do his fair share of the work. There is\r\na certain division of labour among Dyaks, and there are some kinds of\r\nwork which it is usual for the man to do, and other work which falls to\r\nthe share of the woman. It is no unusual thing to hear a woman who wishes\r\nto be divorced from a lazy husband say: “I married because I wanted a man\r\nto work for me; but if I have to do the man’s work as well as my own, as\r\nI have to with a husband like mine, I might just as well be unmarried.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAK GIRL SPINNING\r\n\r\nShe is seated on a mat, in a characteristic attitude, and is making yarn\r\nout of the cotton, using a primitive spinning-wheel.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed from what has been said that conjugal affection\r\nis rare among the Dyaks. On the contrary, a great deal of it exists,\r\nand the men very often love their wives and think a great deal of their\r\nopinion. They will not decide upon any important course of action without\r\nconsulting them. Where there are children, the husbands very often help\r\ntheir wives in doing more than their share of the man’s work, and I have\r\noften seen the men nursing and fondling their naked babies when the\r\nmothers were busy.\r\n\r\nDyaks who have come in contact with civilization, and who have been to\r\nschool themselves, see the advantages of being educated, and I know of\r\na Dyak in Saribas who married a young wife and sent her to the Society\r\nfor the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts Girls’ School in the\r\ncapital of Sarawak (Kuching) for two years to be taught before she came\r\nto live with him in his Dyak home.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned before, the parents of a woman often tyrannize over\r\na son-in-law who takes up his abode with them. If the woman herself side\r\nwith her parents, it is often very unpleasant for the husband. I remember\r\ntalking over this matter with some Dyaks at Sebetan, and telling them\r\nthat I thought, as a general rule, it was better for husband and wife\r\nto settle between themselves any differences they might have, without\r\ninterference from others, and I mentioned certain cases of divorce which,\r\nI said, I felt sure would not have come about except for the interference\r\nof the mothers-in-law, who behaved foolishly and caused mischief. Then I\r\nturned round to one of the men present, and said:—\r\n\r\n“You have lived for many years with your wife’s relatives, and you seem\r\nto be happy enough. You are one of the few who have had no differences\r\nwith the relatives of their wives, and live happily in spite of your\r\nmother-in-law’s presence in your house. Is it not so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “we do get on very well now, but it was not always so.\r\nWhen I was first married, her parents were always taking her side against\r\nme, and the result was that I was ordered about so much, and found fault\r\nwith so often, that I was beginning to get sick of it. However, matters\r\nsoon came to a climax. One day my wife was pounding paddy, and, turning\r\nto me, she said: ‘This _lesong_ (wooden mortar) is not a nice one; will\r\nyou make me another?’ I said I would, and I went to the jungle, cut down\r\na tree, and made a new wooden mortar, and carried it home. She did not\r\nlike it. It was, in her opinion, no better than the other.”\r\n\r\n(I may mention here that the Dyak women like a mortar that makes a great\r\ndeal of noise when paddy is pounded in it to rid it of the husk. Probably\r\nthe only fault to be found with the mortar was that it did not make\r\nenough noise when in use to satisfy his wife.)\r\n\r\n“I was told,” the man continued, “to make another _lesong_ for my wife.\r\nThis I obediently did, but I did not succeed in pleasing her with my\r\nsecond attempt any better than I did with my first. I was told to go into\r\nthe jungle and make her a third mortar. This I refused to do. I said that\r\nevidently I could not make a wooden mortar to her satisfaction, and the\r\nbest thing to do was for us to get someone else to make one, and pay him\r\nfor it. She was very angry at my refusal, and said that when she married\r\nshe did not expect to have to buy things which other husbands made for\r\ntheir wives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK BRIDE\r\n\r\nShe wears a silver filigree comb in her hair and a necklace of brass or\r\nsilver buttons. Round her body is the brass corset worn by the women and\r\nthree belts of silver coins. She has bangles on her wrists and earrings\r\nin her ears. Her jacket is slung over her right shoulder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK GIRL\r\n\r\nRound her body is the brass corset the women wear, and she has a necklace\r\nmade of large buttons of brass or silver.]\r\n\r\n“In all this,” he said, “my wife was backed up by her mother, who, in\r\nmany ways, had been making mischief, and was often criticizing my work.\r\nI said little, but when she called me the ‘dead body of a man’ (_bangkai\r\norang_) it was more than I could stand, and when she went on to say that\r\nI might just as well return to my people if I was not going to work, I\r\npacked up my clothes and returned to my parents.\r\n\r\n“After a few days my mother-in-law came to the house of my parents to\r\nask me to return with her. I refused to do so, because, I said, I was\r\nnot sure what sort of reception I should get from my wife. She said\r\nthat she had been sent by my wife, and that I need not fear that there\r\nwould be any unpleasantness. Still I refused to return, and I told my\r\nmother-in-law that I would not return unless my wife came herself to ask\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n(I may remark that it is a very unusual thing for a man to speak in this\r\nway to his mother-in-law. She is treated with so much respect that it is\r\nvery seldom a Dyak dares to oppose her wishes.)\r\n\r\n“My mother-in-law returned to her house, and a few days after she and my\r\nwife came to fetch me. I went back with them, and ever since I have had\r\nno serious trouble either with my wife or mother-in-law.”\r\n\r\nI have already said that until children are born a Dyak husband and wife\r\noften separate from each other for very trivial reasons. After the birth\r\nof children there is seldom a divorce except for adultery, and even then\r\nvery often the friends and relatives try hard—sometimes successfully—to\r\npersuade the husband and wife to live together again for the sake of the\r\nchildren. This lax view that Dyaks have of the marriage tie causes them\r\nvery often to marry without any serious consideration. Where divorce is\r\neasy it naturally follows that marriage ceases to be a serious matter,\r\nwhich ought not to be “taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly,”\r\nas the marriage service has it.\r\n\r\nI remember one day holding a service at a little chapel in a village in\r\nSaribas, and giving an address on marriage, and trying to explain to\r\nmy small congregation of Dyaks the Christian view of it. I said that\r\nmarriage ought to be a life-long tie, that the Dyak custom of husband and\r\nwife separating for any trivial cause was a bad one, and that Christians,\r\nwhen married, should live together “for better for worse” till death\r\nparted them. An old Dyak present interrupted me by asking: “What if one\r\nof them commits adultery?”\r\n\r\nI went on to say that adultery was the only reason which Christ said\r\njustified a divorce.\r\n\r\nI mention this little incident because I think it shows in an indirect\r\nway that deep down in the Dyak heart there is a feeling that adultery is\r\na terrible crime, far worse than any other, and that where there has been\r\nadultery it is impossible for husband and wife to live happily together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBURIAL RITES\r\n\r\n    Life beyond the grave—Wailings—Rice strewn on the dead man’s\r\n    chest—The professional wailer—Feeding the dead—Carrying the\r\n    dead—The grave—Articles buried with the dead—_Baiya_—Fire lit\r\n    at sunset—The _ulit_, or mourning—_Pana_, or offering to the\r\n    dead—The wailer’s song—_Sumping_—Periodical _Sabak_—Feast in\r\n    honour of the dead—_Gawai Antu_—The dead not forgotten—Other\r\n    methods of disposing of the dead besides burial—Dyak ideas of a\r\n    future life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath for the Dyak does not mean the end of all. He has a belief in a\r\nlife beyond the grave—a life different indeed from his existence in\r\nthe flesh, with all its cares and anxieties, a life with little of the\r\nspiritual about it, but still, for all that, life, and not annihilation.\r\nThe soul survives burial, and in Hades (_Sabayan_) lives anew much the\r\nsame life as he does on earth, building houses and sowing and planting as\r\ndo his friends and relatives in this world. He is able to watch those on\r\nearth, and can help them when required, and so his aid is often asked for\r\nin time of need. And in the Sea Dyak burial rites there are seen glimpses\r\nof a belief in the communion between those on earth and those who have\r\ncrossed the River of Death, such as we would expect to find only among\r\npeople of a higher civilization and a higher education.\r\n\r\nFrom that distant unknown land of Death the spirits of the dead\r\nrelatives and friends of the dying man come in a long boat, so the Dyaks\r\nsay, to take his soul away. For a long time there is a struggle between\r\nthose on earth trying to keep him back and the unseen spirits urging him\r\nto join them. Over and over again when the man loses consciousness there\r\nare distracted cries from those around of “_Pulai! Pulai!_”—“Come back!\r\nCome back!”\r\n\r\nThe witch-doctors, who are often called in, try by their incantations to\r\nfrighten away the spirits.\r\n\r\nImmediately the breath has left the body, the female relatives begin\r\nloud and melancholy wailings. They wash the corpse and get it ready for\r\nburial. All the able-bodied men of the village turn out to help the\r\nbereaved family, as in a hot climate the burial has to take place within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nRice is strewn on the dead man’s chest. This is a propitiation to the\r\ngods for any wrong he may have done while alive. According to Dyak\r\nideas, death is the punishment for some sin, and for that sin some\r\nsacrifice must be made, or the living may also suffer for it. By sin\r\nis meant either the doing of any of the thousand and one things which\r\na Dyak considers forbidden by the gods, or the disregarding of the\r\nwarnings of birds or dreams. While this sin-offering is being made,\r\nothers collect his belongings—his clothes, his implements of work, his\r\nshield, his spear—all of which are to be buried with him, and which he\r\nis supposed to make use of in the other world. The corpse is dressed in\r\nits best garments, and is borne into the great open veranda or common\r\nhall (_ruai_), and covered with a Dyak sheet. Here he is surrounded by\r\nthe friends and relatives, to be mourned over. Sometimes a professional\r\nwailer sits on a swing near the head of the corpse and sings her song of\r\nmourning. She calls upon the different parts of the house, beginning at\r\nthe roof-ridge and proceeding downwards, and blames them for not keeping\r\nback the soul of the dead man. Then in highly figurative language she\r\nspeaks of the journey to Hades, and asks the spirits to guide his soul in\r\nthe right direction, so that he may not lose his way.\r\n\r\nWhile the body is laid out in the public part of the house none may step\r\nover the corpse. There is no special reason against this except the\r\ngeneral belief that if such a thing were done the dead man would not live\r\nhappily in Hades, but would continually visit his former home and trouble\r\nthe living.\r\n\r\nAt sunset a fire is lit by the side of the corpse. All through the long\r\nhours of the night the sad watchers sit around, and the loud sustained\r\ncry of the professional wailer mingles with the sobs and spasmodic\r\nutterances of those who feel most the loss of the dead man.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning food is given him to strengthen him for\r\nthat long journey to Hades, and a little cotton-wool is placed as a\r\npillow for his head. The food is given to the dead in a curious manner.\r\nRice is dashed into his mouth, and the earthen cooking-pot is then broken\r\nin pieces—it may not be used for the living, having once been used for\r\nthe dead. The pillow of cotton-wool is about the size of a pigeon’s egg,\r\nand, as far as can be gathered from the Dyaks, it in some way insures the\r\ncomfort of the dead man in the other world.\r\n\r\nThen the body, wrapped in mats and covered over with a light framework of\r\nwood, is carried on the shoulders of four men. As they descend the ladder\r\nashes from the fire burnt near the corpse are thrown after them by the\r\npeople who are left in the house. This is done in order that the dead\r\nman may not know his way back to the house, and may thus be unable to\r\ntrouble his friends afterwards. The women are not permitted to accompany\r\nthe body to its burial, so they raise a dismal wail as the body is\r\ncarried away from the house.\r\n\r\nThe body is either taken by boat or carried on foot to the jungle, where\r\na tree is to be cut down for the coffin. When the spot is reached a halt\r\nis made. A fowl is killed, and the blood is collected in a cup and mixed\r\nwith a little water. Each person present is touched with the blood, to\r\npropitiate the gods of the infernal world and to secure immunity from any\r\nevil consequences to the persons engaged in the funeral rites. They now\r\nset to work to make the coffin. A tree is felled, and the required length\r\ncut off. This is split in two, and each half is hollowed out. The corpse\r\nis then placed in this rude coffin, the two parts of which are now firmly\r\nlashed together with cane.\r\n\r\nThe crowd then proceed either on foot or by boat to the place of burial.\r\nThe burial-ground, or _pendam_, is generally on the side of a hill. The\r\ntrees are not cut down, and there is nothing to distinguish the _pendam_\r\nfrom ordinary jungle. The Dyaks regard a cemetery with superstitious\r\nterror as the abode of spirits, and never go to it except to bury their\r\ndead, and when they do this they do not stay longer than they can help,\r\nbut hurry away lest they should meet some spirit from the other world.\r\nThe consequence is that the place is wild and uncared for. The graves,\r\nbeing shallow and not fenced round, are often dug up by wild pigs or\r\nbears, and bones and skulls strew the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK CEMETERY BY THE RIVER-SIDE\r\n\r\nThis shows the carved wooden erections put over some of the graves.\r\nThe trees are generally left standing in a Dyak cemetery, and a little\r\ndistance from the river bank it is covered with jungle growth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK DANCING THE WAR DANCE\r\n\r\nHe is imitating the action of a man creeping through the jungle, sword in\r\nhand, to attack the enemy. The man on the right is playing a Dyak musical\r\ninstrument called the _Engkrurai_.]\r\n\r\nWhen they reach the spot where the grave is to be, some rice is scattered\r\non the ground. This rice is the price paid to _Pulang Gana_, the spirit\r\nwho owns the land, for the grave. Then a fowl is killed, and the blood\r\nsprinkled on the ground. These offerings are made to prevent the spirits\r\nfrom hurting any of those who take part in digging the grave.\r\n\r\nThe graves are rarely more than three feet deep. The Dyaks dare not step\r\ninto the grave to deepen it, because, according to their superstitious\r\nideas, anyone who does such a thing will die a violent death. They use no\r\nspade or hoe to turn up the earth, but cut the soil with their choppers,\r\nand throw up the mould with their hands. They dig into it as far as their\r\narms will reach and no farther.\r\n\r\nThe corpse is lowered into the grave hurriedly, and all present shout.\r\nThey cry to the dead man, but why they do so or what advantage is gained\r\nby doing so is not clear. The reason why the body is hurriedly buried is\r\nthe fear lest the cry of some sacred bird may be heard, and the burial\r\nof the man become unpropitious; the less time they take in putting the\r\ncorpse into the grave the less chance there is of this.\r\n\r\nWith the corpse are put for use in the next world various articles of\r\nclothing, personal ornaments, weapons of warfare, implements for farm\r\nwork, and even instruments of music, according to the sex and natural\r\nproclivities of the dead. Some of these things belonged to the departed;\r\nothers are given by friends as tokens of affection. Rice, tobacco, and\r\nbetel-nut are also cast into the grave, as these things may be needed\r\nin the other world. It used to be the custom to place money, gold and\r\nsilver ornaments, and brass utensils in the grave, but these articles\r\nwere so often stolen that, nowadays, it is the practice to break in\r\npieces all the utensils placed in the grave. Jars and brass gongs are\r\nnot buried with the corpse, but placed on the grave. When all this has\r\nbeen done, the grave is fenced round, and food and drink are placed in\r\nthe enclosure, and at either end something is put to indicate the sex and\r\nfavourite occupation of the deceased. If the grave be that of a warrior,\r\nit is roofed and decorated with streamers, and such of his weapons as are\r\nnot buried with him are hung about, and the ground around is palisaded\r\nand spiked. The grave of the hunter is distinguished by his blow-pipe and\r\nquiver, together with the trophies of the chase—stags’ antlers and boars’\r\ntusks. Some article of feminine attire or work—spindles or petticoats, or\r\nwaist-rings or water-gourds—indicate the graves of women. The graves of\r\nthe rich have valuable jars or gongs, which are secured in their places\r\nby having a stake driven through them and thus rendered worthless.\r\n\r\nA lighted torch is always carried to a funeral, and when the body is\r\nburied it is extinguished at the grave.\r\n\r\nThe articles which are buried with the dead person or put upon the grave\r\nare called _baiya_. They are for the use of the spirit in the other\r\nworld. The Dyaks argue that though the articles placed on the grave\r\nremain there, still the spirit of these articles are of use to the soul\r\nin Hades, and so their gifts are not wasted.\r\n\r\nThose of the mourners who leave the grave last plant sharpened stakes in\r\nthe ground, so that the spirit of the dead man may not follow them back\r\nto the Dyak house, the stakes planted in the ground being supposed to\r\nprevent his return.\r\n\r\nAt sunset on the day of death, a fire is lit at the landing-place on\r\nthe bank of the river near the house of the dead man. This fire is kept\r\nburning all night. For three or four evenings after death they light\r\na fire either at the landing-place or somewhere outside the house.\r\nThis is for the use of the departed, for in Hades fire is not to be\r\nprocured without paying for it, and if the dead find any difficulty about\r\nobtaining fire, they can come and fetch it from the fire lit by their\r\nearthly friends. This idea does not seem consistent with the many things\r\ndone to prevent the soul of the dead man finding his way back to his\r\nearthly home.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a death among the Dyaks, none of the inmates of the house\r\ndo any farm work on the day of the funeral. In the case of the death of a\r\nChief, they refrain from work for three days or even more.\r\n\r\nWhen anyone dies, the _ulit_, or mourning, has to be observed by the\r\nimmediate relatives of the deceased, and continues until the feast in\r\nhonour of the dead (_Gawai Antu_) is held. All the finery and bright\r\narticles of apparel belonging to the relatives are tied up in a bundle\r\nand put away. At the _Gawai Antu_ the string which binds this bundle\r\ntogether is cut by the headman of the house, and they may use their\r\nbright garments again. The mourning (_ulit_) includes many other\r\nrestrictions beside the prohibition of ornaments and bright-coloured\r\nclothing. There must be no striking of gongs or drums or dancing or\r\nmerrymaking in the house. In the old days the mourning could not end\r\nuntil one of the relatives managed to secure a human head.\r\n\r\nOn the third day an observance called _Pana_ is made. A plate containing\r\nrice and other eatables, as well as a Dyak chopper, an axe, and a cup,\r\nare taken by several of the neighbours to the room of the dead person.\r\nThey go to tell the mourners to weep no more, and to give the dead man\r\nfood. They enter the room, and one of them—generally an old man of\r\nsome standing—pushes open the window with the chopper, and the offering\r\nof food is thrown out for the benefit of the dead man and his spirit\r\ncompanions. Up to this time the near relatives of the dead man live in\r\nstrict seclusion in their room, but after it they may come out to the\r\npublic part of the house and return to their usual occupations. But the\r\n_ulit_, or mourning, is still observed, and does not come to an end till\r\nthe feast in honour of the dead (_Gawai Antu_) is held.\r\n\r\nAmong tribes where professional wailers exist it is not enough to throw\r\nthe offering of food out of the window at the back of the house. The\r\nwailer must help to send that food to Hades. She sings her incantation\r\nand calls upon the adjutant bird to convey the articles of food and the\r\ntears and sobs of the relatives to the other world. The bird, so sings\r\nthe wailer, speeds on its way, and arrives at the Country of the Dead.\r\nThere the spirits are supposed to see the visitant, and inquire where\r\nit comes from and what is the object of its journey. “Do you come to\r\nlook at the widows? We have thirty-and-one; but only one is handsome.\r\nDo you come to seek after maidens? We have thirty-and-three; but only\r\none is beautiful.” “No,” says the bird, “we have many widows and maidens\r\nin the land of the living; and they are all beautiful and admired of\r\nmen.” They ask as they see what it carries: “What is that you have\r\nbrought with you so securely covered up?” “Bring a vessel, and I will\r\npour the contents of my burden into it.” A large vessel is brought, the\r\ncrowd stand expectant around, and the bird pours out the offering of\r\nfood, and lo! the eatables, as well as the tears and sobs of the living\r\nwhich accompany them, have become gold and silver and precious stones\r\nwondrously beautiful. But the inhabitants of Hades cannot understand what\r\nit all means, and quarrel among themselves. Then an old learned woman,\r\nwho has lived in Hades very many years, speaks. She bids them be silent\r\nand listen to her, and she explains that the bird has come from the land\r\nof the living with presents for them from their earthly friends.\r\n\r\nUntil this _Pana_ is made, the Dyaks say the soul of the dead man is\r\nunsettled. It has not quite left this world, and Hades will not receive\r\nit or give it food and drink. But after this observance it is received\r\nand welcomed as a regular denizen of the spirit world.\r\n\r\nThere is another observance called _Sumping_, which is sometimes carried\r\nout at a varying period after death. The Dyaks bring the symbols and\r\ntrophies of a head-hunting raid and place them in the middle of the\r\npublic hall of the house. The wailer sings her incantation, and procures\r\nthe services of the Spirit of the Winds to convey them to the dead, whose\r\nabode, until now full of discomfort and darkness, becomes at sight of\r\nthese trophies filled with light. The spirits rejoice at the thought that\r\ntheir relatives have revenged upon others their own death.\r\n\r\nThis observance, according to ancient custom, could not be held until the\r\nhead of an enemy had been obtained. It brings out the darker and fiercer\r\nside of the Dyak nature. They would fight with Death if they could, and\r\nrescue their dead friends from his clutches. But as they cannot do this,\r\nthey rejoice in taking vengeance upon the living and killing someone,\r\nso that their relatives in Hades may have the satisfaction of saying:\r\n“My death has been avenged. A life has been paid for my life.” In these\r\ndays, when the Dyaks live under a strong and just Government, it is\r\nvery seldom that this observance can be carried out according to ancient\r\ncustom; now they have either to dispense with the newly-procured human\r\nhead or omit the observance altogether.\r\n\r\nThe dead man is not forgotten. Periodical mournings (_sabak_) at\r\nintervals of two or three months are held in his memory, and the\r\nprofessional wailer calls on the dead man and weeps over him. The\r\nrelatives work themselves up into a frenzy of sorrow on these occasions,\r\nand many of them are often seen weeping sadly. The Dyaks believe that the\r\ndead hear their cries, and that a bond of sympathy unites them with those\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nA year or two after the death the _Gawai Antu_ is held. This feast is\r\nheld in honour of all those that have died since the last _Gawai Antu_\r\nwas held. Small, curiously-shaped baskets, supposed to represent the\r\ndifferent implements a man or woman uses in work when alive, are made and\r\nplaced on the different graves. Thus they furnish the dead with the means\r\nof livelihood in Hades. This feast ends all mourning for the dead, and\r\nafter it has been held there are no more periodical mournings.\r\n\r\nBut even after all mourning has ceased the Dyak still believes that his\r\ndead friends and relatives live and visit the earth. Before going forth\r\non an expedition against the enemy, the dead are invoked, and are begged\r\nto help their friends on earth, so that they may be successful against\r\ntheir foes. In times of peril and of need the dead are called upon; and\r\non the hilltops or in the solitudes of the jungle a man often goes by\r\nhimself and spends the night in the hope that the spirit of some dead\r\nrelative may visit him, and in a dream tell him of some charm by means of\r\nwhich he may overcome difficulties and become rich and great.\r\n\r\nBurial is the usual, but not the only, mode of disposing of the dead.\r\n_Manangs_, or witch-doctors, are never buried, but their coffins are hung\r\nup in the cemetery. Among some tribes a young child dying before he has\r\nany teeth is put in a jar instead of a coffin, and this is tied to the\r\nbranch of some tree in the burial-ground.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak believes in a future life, but it is simply a prolongation of\r\nthe present state of things in a new sphere. Even the journey from this\r\nworld to the land of spirits is much like the journey from one part\r\nof the country to another. The traveller must be provided with food\r\nand money for his journey, which may take a longer or a shorter time,\r\ndependent to a great extent on the liberality of his friends here on\r\nearth and to the kindness of those whose houses he passes in his journey\r\nto the spirit world.\r\n\r\nIf the dead man has been able while in this terrestrial sphere to provide\r\nfor himself assistance in the world of spirits, then his life in the\r\nother world will be an easy one. The spirits of the enemies whose heads\r\nhe has taken become his slaves in the other world, and the man who has\r\nsucceeded in killing many enemies lives in Hades a life of ease.\r\n\r\nI have given the general belief among the Sea Dyaks about the future\r\nexistence. But occasionally other conceptions are met with. The idea of\r\nmetempsychosis is not unknown, and I have met a Dyak who treated a snake\r\nwith the greatest kindness, because he said it had been revealed to him\r\nin a dream that the spirit of his grandfather dwelt in that snake.\r\n\r\nSome Dyaks speak of a series of spirit worlds through which their souls\r\nmust pass before they become finally extinct. Some Dyaks say they have to\r\ndie three times; others say seven times; but all seem to agree in the\r\nidea that after these successive dyings they practically cease to exist,\r\nand are absorbed into air and fog. They do not believe in an endless\r\nlife, because perhaps they lack the mental capacity to conceive of such a\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTRAVELLING IN SARAWAK\r\n\r\n    Travelling by boat—Paddles v. oars—Dangers—Tidal\r\n    bores—Sandbanks—_Langan_—Up-river travelling—Poling—Camping\r\n    out at night—Travelling on foot—Jungle paths—Scenery—Wild\r\n    animals—The _Orang-utan_—Vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the Sea Dyaks live on the banks of the rivers, so that travelling\r\nis usually done by boat. The lower reaches of the river have very\r\nswift tides, against which it is impossible to row or paddle; so, when\r\ntravelling up-river, the flood-tide is taken advantage of, and the boat\r\neither anchors or is tied to the bank during the ebb, and _vice versâ_.\r\nSome of the boats used by the Dyaks are roomy and well built. The Balaus\r\nare very good boat-builders, and their boats are very well made and swift.\r\n\r\nThe question is sometimes raised as to whether oars or paddles propel a\r\nboat best. If the number of boatmen be taken into consideration, then\r\noars certainly drive a boat along much faster than paddles. Four oars\r\nwould be sufficient for a boat thirty or forty feet long, but for a boat\r\nof that length at least twenty paddles would be needed to make it travel\r\nat any pace.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks sit in their boats on a rough matting made of split bamboo\r\ntied together with cane. For shelter against the sun and rain they have\r\nan awning made of palm-leaves (_kadjang_). This is tied on to a rough\r\nframework of wood fixed on the boat, and is an excellent protection\r\nagainst the weather.\r\n\r\nThere are many dangers to be guarded against when travelling by boat in\r\nBorneo. Many rivers have a large tidal bore during the spring-tides,\r\nand if the boat be in some narrow part of the river when it meets the\r\ntidal bore it is likely to be swamped. The safest course is to wait for\r\nthe tidal bore in some broad part of the river, where it is not at all\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are also many sand-banks, and though Dyak boats draw little water,\r\nstill these have to be guarded against when the tide is very swift. I\r\nhave known cases where a boat has struck against a sand-bank and been\r\nrolled over and over by the swift tide, and lives lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOAT-TRAVELLING\r\n\r\nA boat being dragged through the rapids. The boatmen are wading in the\r\nwater and dragging it along.]\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the lower reaches of the large Bornean rivers,\r\nwhere large sand-banks are to be found, the swift incoming spring-tide\r\nmakes, soon after it has covered the sand-bank, a peculiar dangerous\r\nmotion of the water, called by the natives _langan_. We all know the\r\nbubbling appearance of boiling water in an open pot, and if we picture\r\nto ourselves that kind of thing on a very large scale, it will give a\r\ngood idea of what the _langan_ is like. It does not last long in any\r\nparticular part of the river, because, as soon as the water has risen and\r\nis deeper, the _langan_ disappears. It is most dangerous. The peculiar\r\nmotion of the water is so irregular and uncertain that small boats are\r\neasily swamped, and many lives have been lost owing to this _langan_.\r\nThe part of the Batang Lupar near the village of Rawan is particularly\r\ndangerous from this cause. I have known of many cases of a Dyak boat\r\nbeing swamped by the _langan_ there, and not a single person being saved.\r\nThough the Dyaks are good swimmers, the boat is rolled over by the swift\r\ncurrent, and they have no chance of saving themselves. When I have had\r\nto travel past Rawan during the spring-tides when there is most danger,\r\nif the tide has only just made, I have thought it wisest not to run any\r\nrisks, and have told my boatmen to fasten the boat to the bank, and wait\r\nfor ten minutes, and not to proceed till there was no danger of being\r\nswamped by the terrible _langan_.\r\n\r\nIn the rapids up the rivers travelling is done in a “dug-out,” because\r\nthat draws little water. The boat has a long cane or creeper tied to the\r\nbows, and when it has to be pulled over the rapids some of the men drag\r\nat this, while the others remain in the boat and work with their poles\r\nor small paddles. The skill with which the Dyaks pole the boat along, as\r\nthey stand up in it, is beautiful to see. With a skilful turn of the pole\r\nthey will guide the boat past some huge boulder which it seems impossible\r\nto avoid. The sensation to one sitting in a boat going over the rapids,\r\neither up or down stream, is not particularly pleasant. The boat is\r\nbumped and jerked about, and the water often splashes in. At times the\r\nboat will be propelled by poles; then, when the water is too shallow, the\r\nmen jump out and walk by the side, pulling the boat along. When they get\r\nto deeper water, they jump in again.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are most excellent companions when travelling has to be done.\r\nThey are hard-working and good-tempered, and most resourceful. When one\r\nis travelling in small “dug-outs” in the upper reaches of the river, it\r\noften happens that he has to spend some nights on the journey. If any\r\nDyak house be near, the travellers make for it, knowing well that the\r\nhospitable inmates will gladly give them shelter. But sometimes they\r\nhave to camp out on the river-bank. It is quite remarkable how well the\r\nDyaks manage under such circumstances. I have always admired the way in\r\nwhich in a very short time wood and creepers are got from the jungle,\r\nand a little hut put up for me on a cleared spot on the river-bank. The\r\ncreepers are used for tying the wood together; the _kadjang_ from the\r\nboat is fastened up for the roof of the little hut; a flooring, two or\r\nthree feet off the ground, is made of laths of wood tied together with\r\ncreepers; my small cork boat mattress and curtain are fixed up; and\r\nin about an hour’s time I am safely lodged for the night. The Dyaks\r\nthemselves are very hardy. They will wrap themselves up in their _puah_,\r\nor sheet, and sleep in the open air, sometimes on mats; but if there are\r\nno mats, they will make for themselves a bed of leaves on the ground, and\r\nthink it no great hardship to sleep on this.\r\n\r\nWhen travelling has to be done on foot, one has to walk on a Dyak jungle\r\npath, which consists of the trunks of the giants of the forest placed in\r\na line. No attempt is made to hew the round trunks into an even upper\r\nsurface, so one must walk carefully lest he slip off; for in some parts\r\nthe bark on these tree-trunks is rotten, and in others there is a growth\r\nof wet slippery moss. Over the jungle streams there are Dyak bridges\r\nmade, like the path, of the trunk of a tree, sometimes with a light\r\nhand-rail tied to it, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nI have often travelled on foot through the jungle, accompanied by Dyaks\r\ncarrying my baggage. We have walked in single file on these trunks of\r\ntrees, and have listened to the weird jungle sounds—the creaking of\r\ngiant trees, the strange cries of insects, or birds, or monkeys. And\r\nsometimes in the gathering darkness, when the storm-clouds have hurried\r\noverhead and the winds shrieked through the tree-tops in fierce discord,\r\nruthlessly twanging the harp-strings of Nature, I have understood why\r\nit is that the Dyaks believe that the lone forests are inhabited by the\r\nspirits of the wind and the rivers, of the mountains and the trees.\r\n\r\nNo one can adequately realize the Equatorial Bornean jungle until he sees\r\nit in all its wonder—the heated steamy stillness broken by weird sounds,\r\nthe colossal trees, the birds with brilliant plumage, and the infinite\r\nvariety of monkeys among the branches, sitting, hanging by hands or\r\ntails, leaping, grimacing, jabbering, as they see the strange sight of\r\nhuman beings invading their domains.\r\n\r\nWhat are the wild animals that the traveller is likely to meet as he\r\nwalks through the jungle? The animal life of Borneo is akin to that\r\nof Sumatra or Java, but with certain differences. Borneo is free from\r\ntigers, and this is fortunate, for travelling through the forests would\r\nbe dangerous indeed if tigers were likely to be encountered. The only\r\nwild animals to be met with are the small and comparatively harmless\r\ntree-tiger, and the small brown honey-bear, but neither of them is much\r\nfeared. There are, of course, ferocious crocodiles in the rivers, and\r\nmany varieties of snakes, varying in size from the python downwards. But\r\nthe cobra, so much dreaded in India, is not met with in Borneo, and death\r\nfrom a snake-bite is very rare. The elephant and the rhinoceros seem to\r\nbe confined to the north end of the island. There is the great man-like\r\nape—the _orang-utan_, or _maias_, as it is called by the Dyaks. It is\r\nonly found in a limited area, in the territory between the Batang Lupar\r\nand the Rejang Rivers. As a rule, this animal does not exceed the height\r\nof four feet two inches, though there are stories told of its attaining\r\na far greater size. The height, however, gives a poor idea of the\r\nanimal’s bulk and strength. The body is as large as that of an average\r\nman, but the legs are extremely short. Its arms are of great length, and\r\nmeasure over seven feet in spread. The whole body is covered with long\r\nred hair. It rarely attacks man, but when provoked is very ferocious, and\r\nas its strength is very great, it is a foe not to be despised. There are\r\nnumerous wild boars in the jungle, but they never attack the traveller,\r\nand are not a source of danger.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation of Borneo is rich and varied. By the seashore and at the\r\nmouths of the rivers there grows the _nipa_ palm, “the tree of a thousand\r\nuses.” The young leaves are used for making _kadjangs_, the awnings\r\nwith which Dyak boats are covered. The old leaves are made into _attap_\r\nfor the roofs and walls of their houses. From the blossom a sweet drink\r\nis obtained, and this is converted into sugar. From the ashes of the\r\nburnt stump of this palm salt is obtained. As one travels up a Bornean\r\nriver the _nipa_ palms become less and less plentiful, and one finds the\r\nbanks covered with mangroves. These trees thrive on the muddy banks.\r\nA network of roots grows out of the stem several feet above the soil,\r\nand keeps them firm. At night these mangroves are lit up by myriads of\r\nfireflies. The missionary stationed at Banting many years ago had all the\r\nmangrove-trees, except one on each side of his landing-place, cut down,\r\nand on the darkest night there was no difficulty in knowing where his\r\nboat was to stop. These two trees, covered with fireflies, were not to be\r\nmistaken in the surrounding darkness.\r\n\r\nIn Borneo there are many varieties of palms. There is the _nibong_ palm,\r\nthe trunk of which is often used for the posts of native houses. When\r\nsplit up, it is used for the flooring. There is the _sago_ palm, from\r\nthe pith of the trunk of which sago is obtained. There are the cocoanut\r\nand betel-nut palms, and lastly a useful climbing palm—the cane, or\r\n_rotan_—which is exported in great quantities and used for the seats of\r\nchairs.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of useful woods to be found in the Bornean jungles.\r\nThere is the _bilian_, or iron-wood, which is so valuable for building\r\npurposes, as it is practically indestructible. It will not rot in earth\r\nor water, and it is the only wood that the white ants cannot destroy.\r\nThere are also many other hard woods used for the building of houses and\r\nthe making of keels for boats.\r\n\r\nThe ebony-tree is to be found in Borneo. The ebony is the heart of the\r\ntree, the rest of the wood being of a light colour.\r\n\r\nThe camphor-tree is also found, as well as various trees which produce\r\ngutta and rubber of different sorts.\r\n\r\nThere are many fruit-trees, but the fruit most loved by the Dyaks is the\r\n_durian_. This grows on a large tree, and is about the size of a man’s\r\nhead. When ripe, it is easily split open, and in it are pods in which are\r\nrows of seeds covered with a sweet pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOMENS AND DREAMS\r\n\r\n    Seven omen birds—Other omen animals—Omens sought before\r\n    beginning rice-farming—House-building omens—Substitutions for\r\n    omens—Good and bad omens in farming—A dead animal—Means of\r\n    avoiding bad effects—Omens obeyed at all times—Bird flying\r\n    through a house—A drop of blood—Killing an omen bird or\r\n    insect—Origin of the system of omens—Augury—Dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is conscious of his ignorance of the natural laws which govern\r\nthe world in which he lives. He longs for some guidance in his precarious\r\nfarming, in his work in the lonely depths of the jungle, in his boating\r\nover the dangerous rapids or treacherous tides of the swift rivers. He\r\nis aware that injury or death may suddenly confront him from many an\r\nunexpected source. He knows that Nature has voices, many and varied, and\r\nhe is convinced that if he could only understand those voices aright,\r\nhe would know when to advance and when to recede. He feels the need of\r\nguidance, and he has devised for himself a system of omens.\r\n\r\nLike the ancient Romans, who took auguries from the flight or notes\r\nof certain birds—the raven, the owl, the magpie, the eagle, and the\r\nvulture—the Dyak has his sacred birds, whose flight or calls are supposed\r\nto intimate to him the will of unseen powers. They are seven in number,\r\nand their native names are: _Katupong_, _Beragai_, _Kutok_, _Embuas_,\r\n_Nendak_, _Papau_, and _Bejampong_. They are beautiful in plumage, but,\r\nlike most tropical birds, they have little song, and their calls are\r\nshrill and piercing. They are supposed to be manifestations of the seven\r\nspirit sons of the great god Singalang Burong (see the “Story of Siu,” p.\r\n278).\r\n\r\nThe system, as carried out by the Dyaks, is most elaborate and\r\ncomplicated, and the younger men have constantly to ask the older ones\r\nhow to act in unexpected combinations of apparently contradictory omens.\r\nThe law and observance of omens occupy a greater share of the thoughts of\r\nthe Dyak than any other part of his religion.\r\n\r\nIt is not only to the cry of birds that the Dyaks pay heed. There are\r\ncertain animals—the deer, the armadillo, the lizard, the bat, the\r\npython, the cobra, even the rat, as well as certain insects—which all\r\nmay give omens under special circumstances. But these other creatures\r\nare subordinate to the birds, from which alone augury is sought at the\r\nbeginning of any important undertaking.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the method in which the Dyaks carry out their system of\r\nomens may be gathered from what is done at the commencement of the yearly\r\nrice-farming. Some man who has the reputation of being fortunate, and\r\nhas had large paddy crops, will be the augur, and undertake to obtain\r\nomens for a large area of land on which he and others intend to plant.\r\nThe Dyaks begin clearing the ground of jungle and high grass when the\r\nPleiades appear at a certain height above the horizon at sunset. Some\r\nlittle time before this the augur sets about his work. He will have to\r\nhear the cry of the _nendak_, the _katupong_, and the _beragai_, all\r\non his left. If these cries come from birds on his right, they are not\r\npropitious. The cries of the other sacred birds must sound on his right.\r\nHe goes forth in the early morning, and wanders about the jungle till the\r\ncry of the _nendak_ is heard on his left. He will then break off a twig\r\nof anything growing near, and take it home and put it in a safe place.\r\nBut it may happen that some other omen bird or animal is first to be\r\nseen or heard. In that case he must give the matter up, return, and try\r\nhis chance another day. Thus, sometimes several days pass before he has\r\nobtained his first omen. When he has heard the _nendak_, he will then\r\nlisten for the _katupong_ and the other birds in the necessary order.\r\nThere is always the liability of delays caused by the wrong birds being\r\nheard, and it may possibly be a month or more before he obtains all those\r\naugural predictions, which will give him confidence that his farming for\r\nthe year will be successful. When the augur has collected a twig for\r\neach bird he has heard, he takes these to the land selected for farming,\r\nburies them in the ground, and with a short form of address to the birds\r\nand to Pulang Gana—the god of the Earth—clears a small portion of the\r\nground of grass or jungle, and then returns home. The magic virtues of\r\nthe birds have been conveyed to the land, and the work of clearing it for\r\nplanting may be begun at any time.\r\n\r\nThe sacred birds can be bad omens as well as good. If heard on the wrong\r\nside, or in the wrong order, the matter in hand must be postponed or\r\naltogether abandoned, unless a subsequent conjunction of good omens\r\noccurs, which in the judgment of old experts more than counterbalances\r\nthe bad omens.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned the omens necessary before planting the seed. In a\r\nsimilar manner, before beginning to build a house, or starting on a war\r\nexpedition, or undertaking any new line of action, certain omens are\r\nrequired if good fortune is to attend them and the Fates be propitious.\r\n\r\nFor house-building, the cries of the same birds are required, and in the\r\nsame order as before planting the seed. But for a war expedition, birds\r\nheard on the right hand are best, except in the case of the _nendak_,\r\nwhich may be heard either on the right or on the left hand side.\r\n\r\nThere are, I believe, certain substitutions for this tedious process of\r\nseeking the omens of birds. It is said that for farming, if a piece of\r\ngold be hidden in the ground, the hearing of the proper omen birds may be\r\ndispensed with. If a fowl be sacrificed, and the blood made to drop in a\r\nhole in the earth in which the fowl is afterwards buried, it is said the\r\ngods will be satisfied, and a good harvest ensue. And on the occasion of\r\na war expedition, if an offering is made with beating of gongs and drums\r\non starting from the house, it is said that no cries of birds need be\r\nobeyed afterwards. But none of these methods are ever used, the Dyaks\r\npreferring to submit to the tedious procedure of listening to the cries\r\nof the birds.\r\n\r\nIt is in regard to farming that the practice is most conspicuous. And if\r\nany of these omen birds are heard or seen by the Dyak on his way to his\r\nwork on his paddy land, it foretells either good or evil to himself or\r\nto his farm—if good, then all is well, and he goes on his way rejoicing;\r\nif evil, he will at once turn back and wait for the following day before\r\ngoing to his work again. The _nendak_ foretells good, whether heard on\r\nthe right hand or the left; so does the _katupong_; but the _papau_ is\r\nof evil omen, and, if heard, the man must at once beat a retreat. A\r\n_beragai_ heard occasionally does not matter, but if heard frequently,\r\nno work must be done for one day. The _embuas_ heard on the right hand\r\nis very bad, and in order to insure a good harvest, the unlucky man must\r\nnot work on his farm for five days. The cry of the _beragai_ acts as an\r\nantidote, and destroys the bad effects of the cries of birds of bad omen.\r\nFor instance, the _kutok_ and _katupong_ are both birds of bad omen, but\r\nif after hearing them the cry of a _beragai_ is heard, no evil effects\r\nneed be dreaded. If the cry of a deer, a gazelle, or a mouse-deer be\r\nheard, or if a rat crosses the path of a man on his way to his farm, a\r\nday’s rest is necessary, or he will either cut himself, or become ill, or\r\nsuffer by failure of his crop.\r\n\r\nWhen a remarkably good omen is heard—one which foretells a plentiful\r\nharvest—the man must go to his farm at once, and do some trifling work\r\nthere, and then return, and in this way clench the foreshadowed luck and\r\nat the same time reverence the spirit who promises it. Should a deer, a\r\ngazelle, or a mouse-deer come out of the jungle to the farm when a man is\r\nat work there, it is an exceptionally good omen. It means that customers\r\nwill come to buy the paddy, and that therefore the crop will be very\r\ngood in order that there may be paddy to sell. They honour this omen by\r\nresting from work for three days.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of all omens is to find anywhere on the farm the dead body\r\nof any animal, especially if it be that of any animal included in the\r\nomen list. It infuses a deadly poison into the whole crop, and one or\r\nother of the owner’s family will certainly die within the year. When\r\nsuch a terrible thing happens, the omen is tested by killing a pig, and\r\ndivining from the appearance of its liver directly after death. If the\r\nliver be pronounced to be of good omen, then all is well, but if not,\r\nthen all the rice grown on that ground must be sold or given away. Other\r\npeople may eat it, for the omen affects only those who own the crops.\r\n\r\nA way of escaping from the bad effects of omens is sometimes resorted\r\nto. Certain men, who by some peculiar magic influence are credited with\r\npossessing in themselves some occult power which can overcome bad omens,\r\nare able by eating some little thing of the produce of the farm to turn\r\naway the evil prognostication and render it ineffectual. Something grown\r\non the farm—a little Indian corn or a few cucumber-shoots—is taken to\r\nthe man. For a small consideration he eats it raw. By this means he\r\nappropriates to himself the evil omen, which can do him no harm, and thus\r\ndelivers the owner of the farm from any possible evil in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak pays heed to these ominous creatures not only in his farming,\r\nbut in all his journeyings and in any kind of work he may be engaged in.\r\nIf he be going to visit a friend, the cry of a bird of ill omen will send\r\nhim back. If he be engaged in carrying beams from the jungle for his\r\nhouse, and hear a _kutok_, or _bejampong_, or an _embuas_, he will at\r\nonce throw down the piece of timber, and it will be left there for a day\r\nor two, or perhaps abandoned altogether. If at night the inhabitants of\r\na long Dyak house hear an owl make a peculiar noise called _sabut_, they\r\nwill all hastily leave the house in the early morning, and remain away,\r\nliving in temporary sheds, for some weeks, and return to the house only\r\nwhen they hear a _nendak_ or _beragai_ cry on their left. There are many\r\nomens which make a place unfit for habitation—for example, a _beragai_\r\nflying over the house or an armadillo crawling up into it.\r\n\r\nSo great is the Dyak belief in omens that a man will sometimes abandon a\r\nnearly finished boat simply because a bird of ill omen flies across its\r\nbows. The labour of weeks will thus be wasted. I have myself seen wooden\r\nbeams and posts left half finished in the jungle, and have learned on\r\ninquiry that some bird of ill omen was heard while the man was at work on\r\nthem, and so they had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIf a _katupong_ flies in at one end of the house and flies out at the\r\nother, it is a bad omen, and the house is often abandoned. On one of my\r\nvisits to Sebetan there was great excitement at the Dyak house near mine\r\nbecause on the previous night a _katupong_ had flown through the house.\r\nOpinions were divided. Some thought the house ought to be abandoned;\r\nothers said that if sacrifices were offered, there was no need to desert\r\nthe house. My opinion was asked. At that time of the year the Dyak house\r\nwas very empty, as most of the families, if not all, would be living on\r\ntheir farms, and I said: “You have fruit-trees growing thickly all round\r\nyour houses, and as you leave your houses empty, I am not surprised at\r\nany bird flying through the house.” My matter-of-fact ideas were not much\r\napproved. As usual in doubtful cases, they sacrificed a pig and examined\r\nits liver. Luckily, the omen was good, so they continued to live in the\r\nhouse; otherwise, they would have had to leave that house and build\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nTo see a drop of blood on a mat or on the floor of a Dyak house is\r\nconsidered a bad omen, which sometimes necessitates the abandoning of\r\nthe house altogether. I remember hearing a woman of this same house in\r\nSebetan relate that, after she and the children had had their evening\r\nmeal, she was putting away the plates on the rack in the wall, when she\r\nsaw a drop of fresh blood on the mat. The Dyaks considered it a most\r\nterrible thing to happen. I was asked what I thought about it. I said\r\nthat probably one of the children had a cut finger, and the blood was\r\nfrom that. The mother was positive the blood was not that of any of her\r\nchildren. I said that perhaps there was a wounded rat in the roof, and\r\nthe blood was from it. I could see that the Dyaks considered me very\r\nignorant. They told me that they were sure the blood must be that of some\r\nspirit who chose that method of showing his displeasure. It was useless\r\nfor me to argue that if the spirit was invisible, his blood must be\r\ninvisible, too.\r\n\r\nTo kill one of these omen creatures, be it bird or insect, is a crime\r\nwhich will certainly be punished by sickness or death. But this\r\nsacredness of life, it may be noticed, does not apply to the deer, the\r\ngazelle, the mouse-deer, the armadillo, and the iguana, all of which they\r\nfreely kill for food. Rats also are killed, as they are great pests. It\r\nwould seem that physical requirements are stronger than religious theory.\r\n\r\nThis is the merest outline of the practice of interpreting omens among\r\nthe Dyaks, but it will give some idea of the tediousness of the process.\r\nAnd the intricacies of the subject are great. The different combinations\r\nof these voices of Nature are endless, and it is difficult to know in\r\neach special case whether the spirits intend to foretell good or bad\r\nfortune. It is not an unusual thing to see old men, industrious and\r\nsensible in ordinary matters of life, sitting down for hours discussing\r\nthe probable effect on their destiny of some special combination of omens.\r\n\r\nThe full Dyak explanation of the origin of this system of listening to\r\nthe cries of certain birds is contained in the “Story of Siu” (see p.\r\n278).\r\n\r\nAnother story tells how some Dyaks in the Batang Lupar made a great\r\nfeast, and invited many guests. When everything was ready, and the\r\narrival of the guests expected, the sound of a great company of people\r\nwas heard near the village. The hosts, thinking they were the invited\r\nfriends, went to meet them, but to their surprise found they were all\r\nutter strangers. However, they received them with due honour, and\r\nentertained them in a manner suitable to the occasion. When the time of\r\ndeparture came, they asked the strange visitors who they were, and from\r\nwhence they came. Their Chief replied: “I am _Singalang Burong_, and\r\nthese are my sons-in-law and their friends. When you hear the voices of\r\nthe following birds [giving their names] you must pay heed to them. They\r\nare our deputies in this lower world.” And then the Dyaks understood that\r\nthey had been entertaining guests from the Spirit World, who rewarded\r\ntheir hospitality by giving them the guidance of the omen system.\r\n\r\nA favourite way of auguring good or evil among the Dyaks is the old\r\nclassical method of examining the entrails of some animal offered in\r\nsacrifice. A pig is killed, and the heart and liver taken out and placed\r\nupon leaves. These organs are handed round to the old men present, who\r\nclosely examine them, and pronounce them to augur either good or evil.\r\nThis method of augury is often resorted to when the interpretation of the\r\ncries of birds is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK YOUTH HOLDING A SPEAR\r\n\r\nHe is wearing the usual waistcloth and has also a sleeveless war-jacket\r\nmade of skin covered with hair.]\r\n\r\nA study of the subject of omens and augury shows the need the Dyak feels,\r\nin common with all mankind, of some guidance from higher and unseen\r\npowers. What is the principle which underlies this system of omens? There\r\nis no doubt a morbid anxiety to know the secrets of the future. But that\r\nis not all. Surely in addition to this there is the hidden conviction\r\nthat the gods have some way of revealing their wishes to mankind, and\r\nthat obedience to the will of the higher powers is the only way to insure\r\nsuccess and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks place implicit confidence in dreams. Their theory is that\r\nduring sleep the soul can hear, see, and understand, and so what is\r\ndreamt is really what the soul sees. When anyone dreams of a distant\r\nland, they believe that his soul has paid a flying visit to that land.\r\nThey interpret their dreams literally. The appearance of deceased\r\nrelatives in dreams is to the Dyaks a proof that the souls live in\r\n_Sabayan_, and as in the dreams they seem to wear the same dress and to\r\nbe engaged in the same occupations as when they lived in this world, it\r\nis difficult to persuade the Dyaks that the life in the other world can\r\nbe different from that in this.\r\n\r\nIn dreams, also, the gods and spirits are supposed to bring charms to\r\nhuman beings. The story is often told of how a man falls asleep, and\r\ndreams that a spirit came to him and gave certain charms, and lo! when he\r\nawakes, he finds them in his hands. Or else he is told in his dream to go\r\nto a certain spot at a certain time, and take some stone which will have\r\nsome mysterious influence for good over his fortunes. Very often these\r\nmagic charms, or _pengaroh_, as they are called by the Dyaks, are nothing\r\nmore than ordinary black pebbles, but the possession of them is supposed\r\nto endow the owner with exceptional powers.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Dyaks often concoct dreams out of their waking thoughts to suit\r\ntheir own interests, and many a man falsely declares he has received the\r\ngift of a charm from some spirit in order to appear of importance before\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, dreams are looked upon by the Dyaks as the means the gods\r\nand spirits use to convey their commands or to warn men of coming danger.\r\nHouses are often deserted, and farming land on which much labour has\r\nbeen spent abandoned, on account of dreams. Newly-married couples often\r\nseparate from the same cause. It is no unusual thing for a man or a woman\r\nto dream that the spirits are hungry and need food. In that case the\r\ninmates of the Dyak house organize a feast, and offerings are made to the\r\nhungry spirits.\r\n\r\nSometimes dreams are made an excuse for evil deeds. A woman who had been\r\nguilty of adultery said she was only carrying out the command of the gods\r\nconveyed to her in a dream, and that if she disobeyed she would probably\r\nbecome mad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE “MANANG,” OR WITCH-DOCTOR\r\n\r\n    _Manangs_ supposed to possess mysterious powers over evil\r\n    spirits—Dyak theory of disease—Treatment of disease—_Lupong_,\r\n    or box of charms—_Batu Ilau_—_Manang_ performances—_Pagar\r\n    Api_—Catching the soul—Sixteen different _manang_\r\n    ceremonies—Killing the demon _Buyu_—_Saut_—Salampandai—Deceit\r\n    of _manangs_—Story of a schoolboy—Smallpox and cholera—Three\r\n    ceremonies of initiation—Different ranks of _manangs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the lower races of mankind there is always to be found the\r\nwitch-doctor, who claims to have mysterious powers, and to be able to\r\nhold communication with the spirit-world. Where there is ignorance as\r\nto the cause of disease, and the effects that different medicines have\r\non the human body, magical ceremonies and pretensions to supernatural\r\npowers are allowed full sway. Fear and anxiety in cases of illness make\r\nmen eager to believe in any suggested remedy, however absurd it may be.\r\nThe Dyaks are no exception to the rule. They have their _manangs_, or\r\nwitch-doctors.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar attribute of the _manang_ is the possession of mysterious\r\npowers over the spirits, rather than any special knowledge of medicines.\r\nThere is often some small idea of the use of certain simple herbal\r\nremedies, but it is not on this knowledge that his importance depends.\r\nThe great function of the _manang_ is to defeat and drive away the\r\nmalignant spirits which cause sickness and death. All maladies are\r\nsupposed to be inflicted by the passing or the touch of demons, who are\r\nenemies to mankind. The Dyak description of most diseases is _pansa\r\nutai_, literally “something passed him.” A spirit passed him and struck\r\nhim. In accordance with this idea of disease, the only person who can\r\ncure the sick man is the one who can cope with the unseen evil spirit.\r\nThe _manang_ claims to be able to do this. He can charm or persuade\r\nor kill the evil spirit and rescue the departing soul from his cruel\r\nclutches. When called in to attend a patient, he, in company with other\r\nmedicine-men, goes through a performance called _Pelian_. There are\r\ndifferent varieties of this ceremony, according to the disease and the\r\namount of the fees paid.\r\n\r\n_Manangs_ are generally called to their profession by a revelation made\r\nto them in dreams by some spirit. Each _manang_, therefore, claims to\r\nhave a familiar spirit, whom he can call to his aid when necessary. When\r\na person receives a call from the spirit, he bids adieu for a while to\r\nhis relatives, abandons his former occupations, and attaches himself to\r\nsome other experienced _manang_, who, for a consideration, will take him\r\nin hand and instruct him in the incantations, a knowledge of which is\r\nnecessary for his calling.\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ looks upon a sick person as in the power of an evil spirit.\r\nAs long as that spirit remains in possession, the patient cannot recover.\r\nHe bids it depart. If it be obstinate and will not go, he summons his\r\nown familiar spirit to his aid. If the evil spirit still refuse to go,\r\nthen the _manang_ admits his inability to deal with the case alone, and\r\nseveral other _manangs_ are called to his aid.\r\n\r\nWhether the patient live or die, the _manang_ is rewarded for his\r\ntrouble. He makes sure of this before he undertakes a case, as he is put\r\nto considerable inconvenience by being fetched away from his own home and\r\nhis own work. He takes up his abode with the patient, and has his meals\r\nwith the family, and in other ways makes himself at home. If a cure be\r\neffected, he receives a present in addition to his regular fee. Herbal\r\nremedies are often administered internally or applied outwardly by him,\r\nbut, in addition to these, spells are muttered and incantations made to\r\nexorcize the evil spirit that is tormenting the man.\r\n\r\nEvery _manang_ consults his familiar spirit as to what is best to be done\r\nfor the case. When a person complains of pain in his body, the familiar\r\nis said to suggest that some mischievous spirit has put something into\r\nhim to cause the pain. The _manang_ will then manipulate the part, and\r\npretend to draw something out—a small piece of wood or a stone, or\r\nwhatever it may chance to be—and exhibit it as the cause of the pain in\r\nthe body. This he has by his magical power been able to remove from the\r\nbody without even leaving a mark on the skin!\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ always possesses a _lupong_, or medicine-box (see p. 184),\r\ngenerally made of the bark of a tree, and this is filled with charms\r\nconsisting of scraps of wood or bark, curiously twisted roots, pebbles,\r\nand fragments of quartz. These medicinal charms are either inherited,\r\nor have been revealed by the spirits in dreams to their owners. One\r\nimportant and necessary charm is the _Batu Ilau_ (“stone of light”)—a bit\r\nof quartz crystal which every _manang_ possesses.\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ never carries his own box of charms; the people who fetch\r\nhim must carry it for him. He arrives at the house of the sick man\r\ngenerally at sunset, for he never performs in daylight, unless the case\r\nis very serious and he is paid extra for doing so. It is difficult and\r\ndangerous work, he says, to have any dealings with the spirits in the\r\ndaytime. Sitting down by the patient, after some inquiries, he produces\r\nout of his medicine-box a boar’s tusk or pebble, or some other charm, and\r\ngently strokes the body with it. If there be several medicine-men called\r\nin, the leader undertakes the preliminary examination, the rest giving\r\ntheir assent.\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ now produces his _Batu Ilau_ (“stone of light”), and gravely\r\nlooks into it to diagnose the character of the disease, and to see where\r\nthe soul is, and to discover what is the proper ceremony necessary for\r\nthe case in question. Where there is serious illness the witch-doctor\r\naffirms that the spirit of the afflicted person has already left the body\r\nand is on its way to the next world, but that he may be able to overtake\r\nit and bring it back, and restore it to the person to whom it belongs.\r\nHe pretends to converse with the spirit that troubles the sick man,\r\nrepeating aloud the answers that the spirit is supposed to make.\r\n\r\nThere are many different ceremonies resorted to in cases of illness, but\r\nthe following is what is common to all _manang_ performances.\r\n\r\nIn the public hall of the Dyak house a long-handled spear is fixed blade\r\nupwards, with a few leaves tied round it, and at its foot are placed the\r\nmedicine-boxes of all the witch-doctors who take part in the ceremony.\r\nThis is called the _Pagar Api_ (“fence of fire”). Why it is called by\r\nthis curious name is not clear. The _manangs_ all squat on the floor,\r\nand the leader begins a long monotonous drawl, the rest either singing\r\nin concert or joining in the choruses or singing antiphonally with him.\r\nAfter a tiresome period of this dull drawling, they stand up and march\r\nwith slow and solemn step in single file round the _Pagar Api_. The\r\nmonotonous chant sometimes slackens, sometimes quickens, as they march\r\nround and round the whole night through, with only one interval for\r\nfood in the middle of the night. The patient simply lies on his mat and\r\nlistens.\r\n\r\nMost of what is chanted is unintelligible, and consists of meaningless\r\nsounds, it being supposed that what is not understood by man is\r\nintelligible to the spirits. But some parts of it, though expressed\r\nin very prolix and ornate language, can be understood by the careful\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nThe witch-doctors call upon the sickness to be off to the ends of the\r\nearth, and return to the unseen regions from whence it came. They invoke\r\nthe aid of spirits and of ancient worthies and unworthies down to their\r\nown immediate ancestors, and spin the invocation out to a sufficient\r\nlength to last till early morning. Then comes the climax to which all\r\nthis has been leading—the truant soul has to be caught and brought back\r\nagain to the body of the sick man.\r\n\r\nIf the patient be in a dangerous state they pretend his soul has escaped\r\nfar away. Perhaps they give out that it has escaped to the river, and\r\nthey will wave about a garment or a piece of woven cloth to imitate the\r\naction of throwing a casting net to enclose it as a fish is caught. Or\r\nelse they say that it has escaped into the jungle, and they will rush\r\nout of the house to secure it there. Or perhaps they say that it has\r\nbeen carried over the sea to unknown lands, and they all sit down and\r\nimitate the action of paddling a boat to follow it. But this is only\r\ndone in special cases, and I have often been told by Dyaks who have been\r\npresent at a particular _manang_ performance: “The man was very ill\r\nindeed. His _samengat_ (soul) had gone so far away that the _manangs_ had\r\ngreat difficulty in finding it. They paddled over the sea, they threw\r\na net into the water, and did many other things before they ultimately\r\nsucceeded in catching it.”\r\n\r\nGenerally the next thing they do is to move faster and faster, till they\r\nrush round the _Pagar Api_ as hard as they can, still singing their\r\nincantation. One of their number suddenly falls to the floor and remains\r\nmotionless. The others sit down round him. The motionless _manang_ is\r\ncovered over with a blanket, and all wait while his spirit is supposed\r\nto hurry away to the other world to find the wandering soul and bring\r\nit back. Presently he revives, and looks vacantly round like a man just\r\nwaking out of sleep. Then he raises his right hand, clenched as if\r\nholding something. That hand contains the soul, and he proceeds to the\r\npatient and solemnly returns it to the body of the sick man through the\r\ncrown of his head, muttering at the same time more words of incantation.\r\nThis “catching of the soul” (_nangkap samengat_) is the great end to\r\nwhich all that has preceded leads up. One function remains to complete\r\nthe cure. A live fowl must be waved over the patient, and as he does\r\nso, the leader sings a special invocation of great length. The animal\r\nis afterwards killed as an offering to the spirits, and eaten by the\r\n_manangs_.\r\n\r\nI have given a general account of all _Pelian_ or _manang_ performances.\r\nThere are different kinds of ceremonies, according to the advice of the\r\n_manang_ or the fee the patient is prepared to pay. In the following list\r\nare the names of the principal _Pelian_. If a patient fail to recover\r\nafter one kind of ceremony, the _manangs_ often recommend another and\r\nmore expensive one.\r\n\r\n1. _Betepas_ (“sweeping”): At the time of the birth of each individual, a\r\nplant is supposed to grow up in the other world. If this plant continues\r\nto grow well, then the man enjoys good and robust health; if it droops,\r\nthe man’s health suffers. When a man, therefore, has bad dreams or feels\r\nslightly unwell for a few days, his plant in Hades is said to be in a bad\r\ncondition, and the _manang_ is called to weed and sweep around it, and by\r\ndoing so improve the condition of the plant, and consequently the health\r\nof the man. This is the first and cheapest function of the _manang_. In\r\nthis he does not “catch the soul,” as is done in the other ceremonies.\r\nAll he does is to mutter some incantation and wave a fowl over the person.\r\n\r\n2. _Berenchah_ (“making an assault”): The door between the private room\r\nand the public veranda is thrown open, and the _manangs_ march backwards\r\nand forwards between room and veranda. Each _manang_ carries two swords,\r\none in each hand, and he beats these against each other, and they rush at\r\nthe patient as if to attack him. This is supposed to be making an assault\r\nagainst the evil spirits and scattering them on all sides.\r\n\r\n3. _Berua_ (“swinging”): A swing is hung up outside the door of the sick\r\nperson’s room. The _manang_ sits in this swing, with the double object of\r\ncatching the man’s soul, if it leave his body, and also of frightening\r\nany evil spirit that may come near to hurt the man.\r\n\r\n4. _Betanam pentik_ (“planting a _pentik_”): A _pentik_ is a roughly\r\ncarved wooden representation of a man. The _manang_ rushes through\r\nthe house three times with this figure, and then plants it in the\r\nground at the foot of the ladder of the house, and near it is put a\r\nwinnowing-basket, a cooking-pot, and the piece of wood used in weaving to\r\npress the threads together. The figure is planted in the ground in the\r\nevening. If it remain till the morning in an upright position, recovery\r\nis certain; but if it be inclined either to the right or left, it is an\r\nomen of death.\r\n\r\n5. _Bepancha_ (“making a _pancha_”): A _pancha_ is a swing erected on the\r\ntanju, or open-air platform, of the house. In this swing the _manang_\r\nsits, and by the movement of his feet “kicks away” the disease. While\r\nseated in this swing he “catches the soul” of the patient.\r\n\r\n6. _Ngelembayan_ (“taking a long sight”): A number of planks are laid\r\nabout in the public veranda, and the _manangs_ walk upon them, chanting\r\ntheir incantations. Then one of their number pretends to swoon, and is\r\nsupposed to sail over rivers and seas to find the soul and bring it back.\r\n\r\n7. _Bebayak_ (“making a _bayak_, or iguana”): Some cooked rice is moulded\r\ninto the shape of an iguana, and is covered over with cloths. This figure\r\nis supposed to eat up the evil spirits which cause the disease.\r\n\r\n8. _Nemuai Ka Sabayan_ (“making a journey to Hades”): The _manangs_,\r\nwith hats on their heads, march up and down the house singing their\r\nincantations. While their bodies are doing this, their souls are supposed\r\nto speed away to Hades and bring back all manner of medicinal charms and\r\ntalismans, as well as the wandering soul of the sick man.\r\n\r\n9. _Betiang garong_ (“making a post for departed souls”): A piece of\r\nbamboo is hung up to the roof-ridge, and an offering is put on the\r\nridge. A swing is erected up there for the _manang_, and he makes his\r\nincantations and “catches the soul.”\r\n\r\n10. _Begiling lantai_ (“rolled up in the flooring”): In this ceremony,\r\nwhen the _manang_ feigns to swoon, his body is rolled up in part of the\r\nflooring, and certain miniature articles are put by his side, just as a\r\ndead man’s possessions are put by his body, and the _manang_ is taken out\r\nof the house as if to be buried.\r\n\r\n11. _Beburong raia_ (“making or acting the adjutant bird”): The _manangs_\r\nwalk up and down the house seven times, imitating the actions of the\r\nadjutant bird. They are covered with native sheets, put over their bodies\r\nlike cloaks, and they pretend to personate the bird.\r\n\r\n12. _Bebaju besi_ (“wearing an iron coat”): Each _manang_ fastens two\r\nchoppers on his back and two in front, and carries one in each hand. Thus\r\nequipped, they walk round and “catch the soul.”\r\n\r\n13. _Bebandong Api_ (“displaying fire”): The patient is laid out in the\r\npublic part of the house, and several small fires are made round him. The\r\n_manangs_ pretend to dissect his body, and fan the flames towards him to\r\ndrive away the sickness.\r\n\r\n14. _Betiti tendai_ (“walking on the _tendai_”): The _tendai_ is the\r\nbar on which cotton is placed when being spun. This bar is oiled and\r\nplaced in the middle of the public veranda, and the _manang_, armed with\r\na chopper in each hand, walks on it in order to “catch the soul” of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n15. _Beremaung_ (“acting the tiger”): In the middle of each family’s\r\nportion of the public veranda is placed a wooden mortar, and the _manang_\r\nprowls round them to “catch the soul” of the patient.\r\n\r\n16. _Betukup rarong_ (“to split open the coffin”): A _manang_ is put in a\r\ncoffin, and by his side are put miniature articles, supposed to represent\r\nthe utensils used in daily life. The other _manangs_ walk round, and\r\nattempt to “catch the soul” of the sick man. When they have succeeded in\r\ndoing this, the coffin is split open and the _manang_ gets out.\r\n\r\nThese are the different kinds of _manang_ ceremonies known, but only the\r\nfirst four are in common use. The others are rarely resorted to nowadays.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these must be mentioned the _Munoh Antu_, or _Bepantap\r\nBuyu_ (“killing the demon,” or “wounding Buyu”). Buyu is the name of the\r\nevil spirit who brings many diseases and causes miscarriage in women.\r\nWhen there is some unusual or obstinate disease, or when a woman has had\r\nmiscarriage, the _manangs_ declare that Buyu is the cause of the trouble,\r\nand must be killed. A large number of witch-doctors are called together,\r\nand the feat is performed in this way: The patient is taken out of the\r\nroom, and laid on the common veranda, and covered with a net. In the room\r\nis placed an offering of food, and the _manangs_ walk in procession up\r\nand down the whole length of the house, chanting their incantations, and\r\ninviting the evil spirit to come to his victim, and also to partake of\r\nthe sumptuous repast that is prepared for him. This occupies some time,\r\nfor the spirit may be far away, on a journey, or fishing, or hunting.\r\nAll lights are extinguished, and in the darkness the _manangs_ walk up\r\nand down the public hall of the Dyak house. At intervals one of them\r\npeeps in at the door to see if the spirit has arrived. In due time the\r\ndemon comes, and then the _manangs_ themselves enter the darkened room.\r\nPresently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting\r\nare heard by the Dyaks outside. Soon after the door is thrown open, and\r\nthe demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to torment his\r\nprey, and instead of a weak and helpless victim he met the crafty and\r\nmighty _manangs_, who have done what ordinary mortals cannot do—attacked\r\nand killed him. As a proof of the reality of the deed lights are\r\nbrought in, and the _manangs_ point to spots of blood on the floor, and\r\noccasionally to the corpse itself in the shape of a dead monkey or snake,\r\nwhich they say was the form the spirit took for the occasion. The trick\r\nis a very simple one. Some time in the day the _manangs_ procure blood\r\nfrom a fowl or some other animal, or it may be from their own bodies,\r\nmix it with water in a bamboo to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the\r\nroom, and scatter it on the floor in the dark. This can safely be done,\r\nas no one but the _manangs_ themselves are in the room. Neither lights\r\nnor outsiders are admitted, on the plea that under such circumstances the\r\ndemon could not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected\r\nand the performers openly accused of imposture; consequently, it is not\r\nnow practised so often as in former times. When this victory over the\r\nspirit is won, the _Pelian_ goes on in the usual way till the morning\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these _Pelian_, there is another _manang_ ceremony which\r\nis often performed, and known by the name of _Saut_. A feast is always\r\ngiven in the house where this ceremony takes place, so it is the occasion\r\nof the gathering of friends from many different Dyak houses. The reasons\r\nfor having this ceremony are various. If they have had a series of bad\r\nharvests, or if one or more people in the house are ill, or if they wish\r\nthe future of one child or many to be bright and prosperous, then the\r\n_manangs_ are called in to perform the _Saut_.\r\n\r\nThe principal god or deity invoked in this ceremony is Selampandai, the\r\ngod who fashions mankind out of clay by hammering them out on an anvil.\r\nAs in other performances of the _manangs_, there is a _Pagar Api_ put up\r\nin the open veranda. The ceremony begins at dusk, when three offerings of\r\nfood are made. The first is to the gods of the women, and this is thrown\r\nout of the window of the room to the ground; the second offering is made\r\nto the gods of the men, and is thrown out to the ground from the unroofed\r\nveranda in front of the house; the third offering is to Selampandai, and\r\nthis is put in the loft over the _Pagar Api_.\r\n\r\nAreca-nut blossoms are placed ready for use on a little shelf, and three\r\nplates of rice are put near them as offerings to the spirits. A large\r\nvaluable jar (_tajau_) filled with native spirit (_tuak_) is placed in\r\nthe public veranda of the house. If there be a sick man to be cured, he\r\nsits on a brass gong (_chanang_) by the _Pagar Api_. The _manangs_ march\r\nup and down singing their incantations. After doing this for some time,\r\neach of them takes a bunch of areca-blossom in his hands, and they strike\r\neach other with these until the blossoms are broken and strew the ground.\r\nThen the _manangs_ walk slowly round the jar, bowing to it at each step.\r\nAfter this they join hands, and rush round the jar as fast as they can\r\ngo, until they are quite exhausted.\r\n\r\nDuring this the guests who have been invited to the feast are seated\r\nabout eating and drinking, or chatting to each other. Later on in the\r\nevening, when the _manangs_ have completed their ceremony, the _tuak_ in\r\nthe jar is handed round in cups for the guests to drink. As usual at\r\nfeasts, when a cup of spirit is given to a man, he drinks the contents\r\nand keeps the cup, and it is no unusual thing to see a man returning from\r\na feast with twenty or thirty cups in his possession.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of deceit and humbug and a little clumsy\r\nsleight-of-hand on the part of the _manang_, and an unlimited amount of\r\nfaith on the part of the patient. The _manang_ must be conscious of his\r\nown deceit, but he believes that his incantations do good, and I have\r\noften known cases of _manangs_ having these ceremonies for members of\r\ntheir own family who are ill. But as a rule a _manang_ is not a truthful\r\nman at all. He is not above telling any number of lies to increase his\r\nimportance. He always pretends to have had previous knowledge of what is\r\ngoing to happen, and often says, when he is called in to a case, that he\r\nknew some time previously that his patient would be ill and come to him\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the average Dyak knows that there is a great\r\ndeal of deceit connected with the _manang’s_ profession, but he also\r\nknows he must submit to that deceit if he wishes to have his help, and he\r\nbelieves that in some way the incantations and remarkable actions of the\r\n_manangs_ help to scare away the evil spirit which is the cause of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nI remember that one of my schoolboys was on a visit to his relatives in\r\nSaribas. His sister was ill, and his parents sent for the _manangs_ to\r\ncure her. The boy protested. He said they were Christians, and ought not\r\nto make incantations to the spirits. But no notice was taken of what he\r\nsaid. The _manang_ went through the usual farce of “catching the soul”\r\nand restoring it to the girl. The boy looked on, and when it was over\r\nsaid to him:\r\n\r\n“You are a fraud. You know you cannot ‘catch the soul,’ and you only\r\npretend to do so, and get paid for it.”\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ was no doubt disgusted at being thus reproved by a little\r\nboy, and replied:\r\n\r\n“I am able to catch the soul and restore it. I will catch your soul if\r\nyou like.”\r\n\r\n“Do so,” said the boy. “I would like you very much to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe foolish _manang_ pretended to faint; then he woke up in the orthodox\r\nmanner with one hand clenched, and when he opened it, lo and behold!\r\nthere was something there which he declared was the boy’s soul.\r\n\r\nThe boy sat and looked on while all this went on.\r\n\r\n“Here is your soul,” the _manang_ said, “which I have succeeded in\r\ncatching after much troubled. Let me restore it to you, so that you may\r\nbe in good health.”\r\n\r\n“Call that my soul?” said the boy. “I make a present of it to you. I do\r\nnot want it. You can keep it. I have a soul which you cannot touch.”\r\n\r\nThe _manang_ was puzzled. He had never known such a thing as anyone\r\ndaring to refuse to have his own soul. He spoke to the parents, and said\r\nthat something terrible would happen to the boy if he persisted in not\r\nhaving his soul returned to his body. The parents wished the boy to do\r\nwhat the _manang_ desired, but he was determined, and did what all Dyak\r\nboys do when they are disobedient—ran off into the jungle, where he knew\r\nhe would not easily be found.\r\n\r\nWhen this boy came back to my school, he told me all about it, and later\r\non, when he and I went to his people, they spoke about it. As the boy was\r\nin very good health, they all had a laugh at the _manang’s_ expense. If,\r\nhowever, anything had happened to the boy, no doubt the _manang_ would\r\nhave made much capital out of it.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes argued with a _manang_ that if the soul has already left\r\nthe body of the patient when he is called in, then the man ought to be\r\ndead. The answer to this is that a man has more than one soul. It is only\r\nwhen _all_ his souls leave the body that the man dies. Some Dyaks assert\r\nthat a man has three souls, and others seven. Their ideas on this matter\r\ndo not agree.\r\n\r\nThough the _manang_ is supposed to be able to defeat the evil spirits\r\nwhich cause disease, there are some diseases which are too terrible for\r\neven his mystical powers. The epidemic scourges of cholera and smallpox\r\nare said to be caused by the direct influence of evil spirits. Smallpox\r\nis said to be caused by the King of Evil Spirits, because it is such a\r\nterrible disease. The name by which it is known among the Dyaks is _Sakit\r\nRajah_ (the sickness of, or caused by, the King of Evil Spirits). But the\r\n_manangs_ will not go near a case of either. Probably a consciousness\r\nof their own powerlessness, combined with a fear of infection, has made\r\nthem assert that those diseases do not come within reach of their powers.\r\nOther means, such as propitiatory sacrifices and offerings, must be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\nTo qualify a man to take part in this mixed system of symbolism\r\nand deceit, a form of initiative ceremony is gone through by other\r\nwitch-doctors, in the course of which he is supposed to learn the secrets\r\nof his mystic calling. The aspirant to the office of _manang_ must first\r\ncommit to memory a certain amount of Dyak traditional lore, to enable him\r\nto take part in the incantations in company with other witch-doctors. But\r\nin addition to this, before he can accomplish the more important parts,\r\nsuch as pretending to catch the soul of a sick man, he must be publicly\r\ninitiated by one or more of the following ceremonies:\r\n\r\n1. The first is called _Besudi_, which means “feeling,” or “touching.”\r\nThe aspirant sits in the veranda of the Dyak house, and a number of\r\nwitch-doctors walk round him singing incantations the whole night. The\r\nceremony performed over him is the same as that done for a sick man\r\n(_Pelian_). This is supposed to endow him with the power to touch and\r\nfeel the maladies of the body, and apply the requisite cure. It admits\r\nto the lowest grade, called _manang mata_ (unripe _manang_), and is\r\nobtainable for the lowest fees.\r\n\r\n2. If a _manang_ wishes to attain a higher grade, he goes through a\r\nsecond ceremony, which is called _Bekliti_, or “opening.” A whole\r\nnight’s incantation is again gone through by the other _manangs_, and\r\nin the early morning the great function of initiation is carried out.\r\nThe witch-doctors lead the aspirant into an apartment curtained off from\r\npublic gaze by large sheets of native woven cloth. There they assert\r\nthey cut his head open, and take out his brains and wash and restore\r\nthem. This is to give him a clear mind to penetrate into the mysteries of\r\ndisease and to circumvent the wiles of the unseen spirits. They insert\r\ngold-dust into his eyes to give him keenness and strength of sight, so\r\nthat he may be able to see the soul wherever it may have wandered. They\r\nplant barbed hooks in the tips of his fingers to enable him to seize the\r\nstruggling soul and hold it fast, and, lastly, they pierce his heart\r\nwith an arrow to make him tender-hearted and full of sympathy with the\r\nsick and suffering. Needless to say, none of these things are done. A\r\nfew symbolic actions representing them are all that are gone through. A\r\ncocoanut is placed on the head of the man and split open instead of the\r\nhead, and so on. After this second ceremony the man is a fully-qualified\r\n_manang_—a _manang mansau_ (a ripe _manang_)—competent to practise all\r\nparts of his deceitful craft.\r\n\r\n3. There is, however, a third and highest grade, which is attainable\r\nonly by ambitious candidates who are rich enough to make the necessary\r\noutlay. They may become _manang bangun_, _manang enjun_ (_manangs_ waved\r\nupon, _manangs_ trampled upon). As in other cases, this involves a whole\r\nnight’s ceremony, in which many of the older witch-doctors take part.\r\nThey begin by walking round and round the aspirant to this high honour,\r\nand wave over him bunches of betel-nut blossom. This is the _bangun_\r\n(the waving upon). Then in the middle of the veranda a large jar is\r\nplaced having a short ladder fastened on each side and connected at the\r\ntop. At various intervals during the night the _manangs_, leading the\r\nnew candidate, march him up one ladder and down the other, but what\r\nthis is supposed to symbolize is not clear. As a finish to this play at\r\nmysteries, the man lays himself flat on the floor and the others walk\r\nover him and trample upon him. In some mysterious way this action is\r\nsupposed to impart to him the supernatural power they themselves possess.\r\nThis is the _enjun_, the “trampling upon.” The fees necessary to obtain\r\nthis highest grade among witch-doctors are high, and therefore few are\r\nable to afford it. One who has been through this ceremony will often be\r\nheard to boast that he is no ordinary spirit-controller or soul-catcher,\r\nbut something far superior—a _manang bangun, manang enjun_.\r\n\r\nThere is a yet higher grade which some _manangs_ attain to—that is, when\r\nhe becomes a _manang bali_. _Bali_ means “changed,” and a _manang bali_\r\nis one who is supposed to have changed his sex, and become a woman.\r\n\r\nSometimes a male _manang_ assumes female attire. He does this, it is\r\nsaid, because he has had a supernatural command conveyed to him in dreams\r\non three separate occasions. To disregard such a command would mean\r\ndeath. He prepares a feast, and sacrifices a pig or two to avert evil\r\nconsequences to the tribe, and then assumes female costume. Thenceforth\r\nhe is treated like a woman, and occupies himself in female pursuits. His\r\nchief aim in life is to copy female manners and habits as accurately as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nA _manang bali_ is paid much higher fees than an ordinary _manang_, and\r\nis often called in when others have been unable to effect a cure. I do\r\nnot think there is ever a case of a young man becoming a _manang bali_.\r\nGenerally it is an old and childless man who uses this means of earning a\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion on which I have met a _manang bali_ was in the upper\r\npart of the Krian River. He seemed a poor sort of creature, and appeared\r\nto me to be looked down upon by the Dyaks, though they were glad\r\nenough to ask his help in cases of illness. He had a “husband,” a lazy\r\ngood-for-nothing, who lived on the earnings of the _manang bali_.\r\n\r\nWomen as well as men may become _manangs_, though it is not usual to meet\r\nmany such nowadays. I have only come across one woman _manang_, and that\r\nwas at Temudok, though I have heard of several others in different parts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the _manang_ claims to be able to hold communion with the\r\nspirit-world would lead one to suppose that he is the priest of the\r\nDyak system of worship. But in practice the _manang_ is more a doctor\r\nthan a priest. His aid is always called in case of illness, but not\r\nnecessarily at the great religious functions of the Dyaks—the sacrifice\r\nof propitiation to Pulang Gana, the god of the earth, or the sacrificial\r\nfeast to Singalang Burong, the god of war. Generally, other Dyaks\r\nare the officiating ministers on these occasions, the only requisite\r\nqualification being the ability to chant the invocation and incantations\r\nwhich accompany the offering and ceremonies. Also at marriages or at\r\nburials the _manang_ is not the officiant, but some old man of standing,\r\nwho has a reputation for being fortunate in his undertakings. A _manang_\r\nmay be the officiant, not by virtue of his office, but for other reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nNATIVE REMEDIES AND DYAK CHARMS\r\n\r\n    Native remedies—Cupping—Charms—A Dyak medicine-chest—Smallpox\r\n    and cholera—My experience at Temudok.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been shown in the preceding chapter, the Dyak looks to\r\nthe _manang_, or witch-doctor, to help him in all cases of illness.\r\nAll sickness is caused by some evil spirit, and the _manang_ alone has\r\npower over these unseen enemies, and he uses incantations to appease or\r\nfrighten these demons away.\r\n\r\nBut though in all cases of serious illness the _manang_ is called in,\r\nyet the treatment of every disease is not left in his hands. Dyaks use\r\nsome things as outward applications, and certain herbal remedies are\r\ngiven internally in the case of illness. I have seen Dyaks boil some\r\nbitter bark in water and drink this liquid when they have fever. Certain\r\noils are also used as liniments. The betel-nut and pepper-leaf (_sireh_)\r\nmixture is used as an outward application for many complaints. Some\r\nman—generally one who is successful in what he undertakes—is asked to\r\nchew some of this hot mixture in his mouth. Having done this, he leans\r\nover and squirts the red saliva over the affected part, and rubs it in\r\nwith his fingers. Dyaks with a headache will be seen with their foreheads\r\nsmeared over with it. Newly-born babes have their stomachs and chests\r\ncovered with daily applications of the same thing by their mothers.\r\n\r\nGround ginger is also used as a poultice, especially in the case of women\r\nwho have given birth to a child; and the water in which pieces of ginger\r\nhave been boiled is drunk by people suffering from ague, as well as by\r\nlying-in women.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very fond of blood-letting whenever there is pain in any\r\npart of the body or limb, and they have a method of “cupping” which\r\nis rather ingenious. The part from which the blood is to be drawn has\r\nincisions made in it with a small knife. The “cupping-glass” is a young\r\nwet bamboo which has a knot at one end, but is open at the other. This\r\nis heated at the fire, and then placed firmly over the incisions made\r\nin the flesh. Cold water is then poured on the bamboo, and it draws\r\nout the blood. The heat fills the bamboo with steam from its dampness.\r\nThe cold water condenses this steam, and makes the bamboo an excellent\r\n“cupping-glass.”\r\n\r\nAs the Dyak believes that all sickness is caused by the spirits, it is\r\nnot surprising that his faith in medicines is small, and that he knows\r\nof few remedies, and depends for his cures either on the mysterious\r\nceremonies of the witch-doctors or on charms which have been made known\r\nby the spirits to the fortunate owners by means of dreams. These charms\r\nare generally pebbles, roots, leaves, feathers, or bits of wood. The\r\npebbles and roots are rubbed on the body, or else put in water and the\r\nwater applied. The leaves, bits of wood, feathers, etc., are burnt, and\r\nthe ashes rubbed on the affected part.\r\n\r\nThough the _manang_ depends upon his power over spirits to cure\r\ndiseases, still he calls to his aid his numerous charms, which he claims\r\nto have received from the spirits. These valued treasures are carried in\r\nhis _lupong_, or medicine-chest.\r\n\r\nThe following excellent description of “The Contents of a Dyak\r\nMedicine-chest,” by Bishop Hose, under whom I worked for many years as a\r\nmissionary to the Dyaks, is reproduced here by his kind permission. The\r\nplace and the people mentioned in it are all well known to me, as the\r\nvillage of Kundong is in the Saribas District, which was in my charge for\r\nmany years:—\r\n\r\n“A few days ago I was in the upper part of the Saribas River, the home of\r\nthe race once celebrated throughout Malaya for daring deeds of piracy. My\r\ncompanion was the Rev. William Howell, the joint author with Mr. D. J.\r\nS. Bailey of “A Dictionary of the Sea Dyak Language,” and an authority\r\non all subjects connected with the religious and other customs of that\r\npeople. We had ascended the Padih, an affluent of the main river, to the\r\nvillage of Kundong, where we were going to spend the night in the Dyak\r\nhouse of which Brok is the _tuai_, or headman. The house is of moderate\r\nlength—about twenty doors—and as usual the apartments of the _tuai_ are\r\nnear the middle of the building. There we were hospitably installed on\r\nthe _ruai_, or undivided hall (sometimes described as a veranda), which\r\nextends throughout the whole length of a Sea Dyak house and occupies\r\nabout half of its area. The good mats were brought down from the _sadau_,\r\nor loft, and spread for us—the rare luxury of a chair was provided for\r\nme—and there we talked, and taught, and answered questions, and dispensed\r\nmedicines, while the inhabitants of the other rooms gathered round us, as\r\nwell as the occupants of our host’s private quarters. There also we ate,\r\nand there we slept when the kindly people would at last consent to our\r\ngoing to bed.\r\n\r\n“The majority of the ‘rooms’—_i.e._, separate tenements—in this house\r\nare inhabited by Christians of long standing, but there are a few who\r\nhave not yet come in. Amongst them is a _manang_, or doctor of magic,\r\nnamed Dasu, who has a large practice in the neighbourhood. I was anxious\r\nto interview him in order to get some information that I wanted for the\r\npurpose of comparing the original spiritual beliefs of the Borneans with\r\nthose that underlie the Mohammedanism of the Malays of the Peninsula.\r\nI was also desirous of ascertaining how far the methods of the Dyak\r\n_manang_, when undertaking to cure diseases, resembled those of the\r\n_pawang_ and _bomor_, his Malay confrères.\r\n\r\n“At our invitation Dr. Dasu came out of his room readily enough, and\r\nsat down with us to chat and smoke a cigarette. He talked freely and\r\nintelligently about such matters of general interest as happened to be\r\nbroached, especially the late expedition against the turbulent people of\r\nthe Ulu Ai, and the terrible epidemic of cholera which was just passing\r\naway. But as soon as we began to give the conversation a professional\r\nturn, and speak of the practice of medicine by the native doctors of\r\nthe Saribas, he put on a look of impenetrable reserve, and could hardly\r\nbe persuaded to speak at all. There is reason to believe that this was\r\nchiefly owing to the presence of Mr. Howell. He has succeeded in winning\r\nthe confidence and affectionate regard of Dyaks to an unusual degree,\r\nbut he is unpopular among the _manangs_. His teaching has led people to\r\nthink for themselves, and wherever he goes the business and the gains of\r\nthe village doctor show a tendency to decrease. Moreover, several of\r\nthe fraternity have submitted to his influence, abandoned their tricks,\r\nand taken to honest farming. It is known, too, that some of these have\r\nsurrendered their whole stock of charms to my friend, and have also made\r\ndangerous revelations, whereby the profession has been much discredited.\r\n\r\n“So Dr. Dasu was only with great difficulty induced to impart to us his\r\nknowledge. He told me, after more confidential relations had grown up\r\nbetween us, that he suspected me of an intention, by some means or other,\r\nto get possession of his precious _materia medica_, and so deprive him\r\nof his means of living. However, his fears were removed by repeated\r\nassurances that it was information only that I wanted, and that I was\r\nconsulting him just because I preferred to get it direct from a professor\r\nof repute rather than trust to reports received from white men. At length\r\nwe persuaded him to be gently catechized. I got some precise answers to\r\nmy questions respecting certain articles of Dyak belief which had been\r\nvariously defined by different investigators, and about which my ideas\r\nhad been a good deal confused. But those matters are not the subject\r\nof this note. It is the concluding incident of the rather prolonged\r\ninterview that I propose to describe.\r\n\r\n“We had talked to one another so pleasantly and frankly that I thought\r\nI might ask Dasu as a great favour to show me his _lupong_, or\r\nmedicine-chest, and the charms of power which it contained. It was quite\r\nevident that this aroused his suspicions again, and he retired within\r\nhimself as before. But the principal people of the house, who were\r\nsitting by us, urged him to consent, and, as old acquaintances of mine,\r\nassured him of my good faith. So he was at last persuaded, and went to\r\nhis own room to fetch the treasure.\r\n\r\n“As I have said, the good mats of the household, as is usual when it\r\nis intended to show respect to a visitor, had been taken down for our\r\naccommodation from the place where they are stored. But we now saw that\r\nthe most valued of them all had been held in reserve. This, which was\r\nmade of fine and very flexible _rotan_, the latest triumph of the skill\r\nand industry of our courteous hostess, Ipah, Brok’s wife, was now handed\r\ndown and spread in front of us for the reception of the great man and the\r\nmysterious implements of his profession. After some considerable delay,\r\nprobably intended to excite our curiosity the more, he appeared, and\r\nsat down on the mat prepared for him, a subdued murmur of applause and\r\nsatisfaction greeting him as he took his seat.\r\n\r\n“A _manang’s lupong_, or case for holding his charms, may be almost\r\nanything. Sometimes it is a box, sometimes a basket, sometimes a bag.\r\nIn this instance it was an open-mouthed basket made of thin shavings of\r\nbamboo hung round the neck of the owner by a strip of bark.\r\n\r\n“Before beginning the exhibition, Dasu made a little formal speech,\r\nin which, with much show of humility, he spoke in depreciation of his\r\nown powers and knowledge and of his collection of remedial charms, as\r\ncompared with those of other members of the profession elsewhere. These\r\nremarks were of course received with complimentary expressions of dissent\r\nfrom the audience; and then at last the contents of the basket were\r\ndisplayed before us. They were tied up together in a cloth bag, the most\r\nhighly-prized being further enclosed in special receptacles of their own,\r\nsuch as a second cloth covering, a little bamboo box with a lid, or a\r\nmatch-box. They were ceremoniously brought out, and placed side by side\r\non the mat of honour. I was then invited to handle and examine them, and\r\nthe name and use of each were told me without any fresh indication of\r\nunwillingness. This is a list of them:\r\n\r\n“1. _Batu bintang_, or star-stone. A small, transparent stone rounded by\r\nthe action of water till it was almost spherical, with a rather rough\r\nsurface. The _manang_ looked upon it as his badge of authority, and told\r\nthe following story of the way he became possessed of it. Many years ago,\r\nin the interval between harvest and the next seed-time, he was working as\r\na cooly in Upper Sarawak. There he had a dream in which he was visited\r\nby the being whom he looked upon as his guardian spirit. As in all cases\r\nwhen this spirit has had any communication to make to him, it appeared in\r\nthe form of a tortoise. It told him that he must forthwith put himself\r\nunder instruction in order to be qualified for the office of a _manang_;\r\nand that if he neglected this command all the spirits would be angry, and\r\ndeath or madness would be the penalty. When he awoke he found the _batu\r\nbintang_ by his side, and had no doubt it was the gift of the spirit.\r\nAccordingly, he did as he was bidden without loss of time. He acquired\r\nthe professional knowledge and the stock-in-trade which were necessary,\r\nand was at last duly initiated with all the proper rites and ceremonies.\r\n\r\n“2. _Batu krat ikan sembilan_, or the petrified section of the Sembilan\r\nfish. This was a curious object which I could not quite make out. It was\r\noblong in shape, about two inches long, one inch broad, and half an inch\r\nthick in the middle, but getting suddenly thinner towards the two edges\r\ntill it became not more than one-sixteenth of an inch. The thick part\r\nwas hollow, having a large, oval-shaped perforation going through it. It\r\nresembled a section from the middle of a large winged seed, but heavy\r\nfor its size, and feeling like a stone. I could not of course test this\r\nby cutting or scraping. When used it is soaked for a time in water; the\r\nwater is then given to the sick man to drink, or is rubbed gently upon\r\nthe part of his body which is affected.\r\n\r\n“3. _Batu lintar_, or thunderbolt. A small, dark-coloured stone, about an\r\ninch and a half long and a quarter of an inch thick at the base, tapering\r\nto a sixteenth of an inch at the point, curved, and rather like a very\r\nsmall rhinoceros horn, and highly polished. It was probably the same\r\nkind of stone as that of which the stone implements found in the Malay\r\nPeninsula are made, which is also called _batu lintar_. It is pressed\r\nfirmly against the body wherever pain is felt.\r\n\r\n“4. _Batu nitar_, another name for thunderbolt. A minute, four-sided\r\ncrystal, half an inch long and about two lines thick. A charm to be used\r\nonly in extreme cases. It is dipped in water and then shaken over the\r\npatient. If he starts when the drops of water fall upon his body he will\r\nrecover, otherwise he will die.\r\n\r\n“5. _Batu krang jiranau_, or petrified root-stock of _jiranau_ (a\r\nzingiberad?). They told us this is the Dyak name of a kind of wild\r\nginger. The word is curiously near to _jerangau_, or _jeringu_,\r\nwhich Ridley says is _Acorus calamus_, ‘a plant much used by native\r\nmedicine-men’ (Wilkinson, ‘Malay-English Dictionary’). The thing so\r\ncalled was possibly part of the backbone of some animal, bent double and\r\nthe two ends tied together, each vertebra brown and shining after long\r\nuse. A charm for dysentery and indigestion, and also for consumption.\r\nIt is dipped in oil and rubbed on the patient’s body in a downward\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n“6. _Batu ilau_, or sparkling stone, also called _batu kras_, or the\r\nhard stone. A six-sided crystal, two inches long and three-quarters of\r\nan inch thick. One end appeared to have been formerly stuck into some\r\nsort of handle, as it was covered with _malau_, or lac. This is the\r\nindispensable sight-stone to be looked into for a view of that which is\r\nfuture, or distant, or otherwise invisible to the ordinary eyes. It is\r\nspecially used by _manangs_ for discovering where the soul of the sick\r\nman, wandering away from the body, is concealing itself, or for detecting\r\nthe particular demon who is causing the illness.\r\n\r\n“There were also, jumbled up together at the bottom of the bag, a number\r\nof tusks of wild boar, pebbles, and other rubbish, but these were\r\npronounced to be _utai ngapa_—things of no importance. One article that\r\nwe hoped to find was absent. Dasu said he should be glad indeed to have\r\nit, but it had never come in his way. It is the _batu burung endan_, or\r\npelican stone. He explained to us that this is a stone which has the\r\nmagical power of securing the presence and co-operation of a spirit who\r\ndwells in the form of the _endan_ (_Pelicanus malaccensis_). When the\r\n_manang_ is seeking to enter _Sabayan_, the spirit-world, in search of\r\nthe errant soul of a sick man, this demon can insure to him a swift and\r\nunimpeded passage thither and back again.\r\n\r\n“While Dasu was telling us the story of his vision of the tortoise spirit\r\nwho gave him the _batu bintang_, I watched his face carefully for any\r\nsign that he believed or did not believe his account. I could not be\r\nsure, but I am inclined to think he did not. He seemed relieved when we\r\nhad finished our examination of his possessions, and he could pack them\r\nall up and carry them off to the security of his own dwelling.\r\n\r\n“Several similar collections of charms have at different times been given\r\nto me, obtained from _manangs_ who have become Christians, but it was\r\nparticularly interesting to me to have a set actually in use exhibited\r\nand explained by their owner.”\r\n\r\nThe Dyak medicine-man, either by means of medicines, or by the use of\r\ncharms, or by his incantations, is supposed to be able to cure all\r\ndiseases. But, as I have said, the two terrible epidemics of cholera and\r\nsmallpox are beyond his powers. No witch-doctor will approach any case of\r\nthese, however well he may be paid.\r\n\r\nSo great is the fear of the Dyaks for either of these diseases that, when\r\na man falls ill of cholera, all his friends desert the house in which he\r\nis, and he is left to manage for himself. In the case of smallpox those\r\nwho have already had the disease may stop and nurse their friends, but\r\nthe others all leave the house and build for themselves shelters in the\r\njungle. Very often people die of smallpox or cholera simply because they\r\nare too ill to cook food, and have no one to attend to their wants.\r\n\r\nWhen there is smallpox or cholera in the country, the Dyaks plant by the\r\npath leading to the house a post with a cross-bar attached to it. This is\r\nto show others that they may not come up to the house. To disregard such\r\na signpost is punishable according to Dyak law.\r\n\r\nWhen I was stationed at Temudok, very early one morning, I heard someone\r\ncalling out from the landing-stage by the river-bank. I got out of bed,\r\nand went to the veranda and shouted out to the man that he was to come\r\nto the house if he had anything to say to me. He came half-way up the\r\nhill, and then said that he was afraid to come any nearer. There were\r\ntwo men dead of smallpox in his boat, and many others ill. Some of the\r\nDyaks in the boat were Christians whom I knew, some were not. We had a\r\nconversation as to what it was best to do under the circumstances. The\r\nfirst thing was to bury the two dead bodies. I had many planks, as the\r\ncarpenters were still at work at the Mission House, and two coffins were\r\nsoon made, the dead bodies placed in them and buried.\r\n\r\nBut what was to be done with those in the boat who were ill? I could not\r\nhave them at the Mission House, because the schoolboys lived there, and\r\nalso one room was used for services which the Christian Dyaks in Temudok\r\nattended. I remembered there was a small Dyak house a little way up-river\r\nwhich had been deserted not long before, and I told the Dyaks to take the\r\nsick to that house, and I promised to supply them with food and anything\r\nelse they might require. Three of the crew were well, but there were\r\neight who had smallpox.\r\n\r\nI sent a message up-river to the friends and relatives of these men,\r\nand asked them to come themselves or send others to nurse them. I was\r\nvery much disappointed to find that only two women came in reply to\r\nmy request. The Dyaks are so afraid of smallpox that even those who\r\nhad already had smallpox, and need not have feared infection, were not\r\nallowed by those who lived with them to nurse a suffering relative.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the first time I went to see these smallpox\r\npatients. They lay in a row in the open veranda of the Dyak house—a\r\nmiserable sight. Plates of rice had been placed by them which they were\r\nnot able to eat. I had the place swept and cleaned, and the food taken\r\naway. I took them some condensed milk and sugar, as well as other food.\r\n\r\nTwo of their number died; the others recovered. Before they returned\r\nto their homes they came to me. I had them disinfected, burnt up their\r\nclothes and mats, etc., and gave them each a piece of cloth for clothing.\r\nI am glad to say they did not take the infection to their houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDYAK RELIGION\r\n\r\n    Certain religious observances—_Petara_, or gods—Singalang\r\n    Burong, the god of war—Pulang Gana, the god of\r\n    the soil—Salampandai, the maker of men—_Mali_, or\r\n    taboo—Spirits—Girgasi, the chief of evil spirits—The dogs\r\n    of the spirits—Stories—Customs connected with the belief in\r\n    spirits—Sacrifices—_Piring_ and _ginselan_—The victim of the\r\n    sacrifice generally eaten, but not always—Material benefits\r\n    expected by the Dyaks by their religious ceremonies—_Nampok_,\r\n    a means of communicating with spirits—_Batu kudi_, “stones of\r\n    wrath”—Belief in a future life—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks have no special forms of worship, nor do they build temples in\r\nhonour of their gods, and yet they certainly have a religion of their\r\nown. They believe in certain gods and spirits, who are supposed to rule\r\nover different departments of life, and they have certain religious\r\nobservances which may be classed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The killing and eating of fowls and pigs offered in sacrifice, of\r\nwhich a portion is set aside for the gods.\r\n\r\n2. The propitiation of gods and spirits by offerings of food.\r\n\r\n3. The use of omens and augury.\r\n\r\n4. The singing of long incantations to the gods and spirits on certain\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks have only one word, _Petara_, to denote the deity, and there\r\nis no literature to appeal to in order to explain this word. We have to\r\ndepend upon what the Dyaks can tell us themselves, and also upon what\r\nwe can gather from the different _pengap_—long incantations made on such\r\nsemi-sacred occasions as the offering of sacrifices at feasts. These\r\n_pengap_ are handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth.\r\nSome Dyaks have good memories, and are able to learn and repeat them.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is that there are many _Petara_, but the whole subject\r\nis one upon which Dyaks have very hazy ideas. They cannot give a\r\nconnected and lucid account of their belief. They all admit, however,\r\nthat the _Petara_ are supernatural beings, who are invisible and have\r\nsuperior powers.\r\n\r\nBut their conception of gods is a very low one, and this is not to be\r\nwondered at, because, as is well known, the grosser the nature of a\r\npeople, the grosser will be their conception of a deity or of deities. We\r\ncan hardly expect a high and spiritual conception of gods from Dyaks in\r\ntheir present intellectual condition. Their _Petara_ are most human-like\r\nbeings. They are represented as delighting in a “feast of rice, and pork,\r\nand venison, cakes and drink,” just as the Dyaks themselves do; and yet\r\nthey are the beings who can bestow the highest blessings the Dyaks can\r\ndesire!\r\n\r\nAlthough the conception of _Petara_ is not an exalted one, yet he is a\r\ngood being, and no evil is attributed to him. He is always on the side of\r\njustice and right. The ordeal of diving is an appeal to _Petara_ to help\r\nthe innocent and overthrow the guilty. He is supposed to be angry at acts\r\nof wickedness, and I have often heard a Dyak say that he dare not commit\r\nsome particular crime, because he fears the displeasure and punishment of\r\n_Petara_. He may be able to hide his wickedness from the eyes of man, but\r\nnot from the _Petara_.\r\n\r\nThere are a large number of gods mentioned by name in the Dyak\r\nincantations, but the following are the most important deities:\r\n\r\nSingalang Burong takes the highest position in honour and dignity, and\r\nis the ruler of the spirit-world. He stands at the head of the Dyak\r\npedigree, and they trace their descent from him, for he is believed\r\nto have once lived on earth as a man. It is doubtful what the word\r\n_Singalang_ means, but _Burong_ means “bird,” and probably _Singalang\r\nBurong_ means “bird chief.” The Dyaks are great observers of omens, as\r\nis noticed in Chapter XII., and among their omens the cries and flight\r\nof certain birds are most important. All these birds are supposed to be\r\nmanifestations of the spirit sons-in-law of Singalang Burong, who is\r\nhimself manifested in the white and brown hawk which is known by his name.\r\n\r\nSingalang Burong is also the god of war, and the guardian spirit of brave\r\nmen. He delights in fighting, and head-taking is his glory. When Dyaks\r\nhave obtained a human head, they make a great feast in his honour and\r\ninvoke his presence. He is the only god ever represented by the Dyaks\r\nin a material form. It is a carved, highly-coloured bird of grotesque\r\nshape. This figure is erected on the top of a pole thirty feet or more in\r\nheight, with its beak pointing in the direction of the enemy’s country,\r\nso that he may “peck at the eyes of the enemy.”\r\n\r\nNext in importance to Singalang Burong is Pulang Gana. He is the tutelary\r\ndeity of the soil, and presides over the rice-farming. He is an important\r\npower in Dyak belief, and to him offerings are made and incantations are\r\nsung at the _Gawai Batu_, the “Stone Feast,” which takes place before the\r\nfarming operations begin, and also at the _Gawai Benih_, the “Festival\r\nof the Seed,” just before the planting of the paddy. Upon his good-will,\r\naccording to Dyak belief, is supposed to depend their supply of the staff\r\nof life. His history is given in a myth handed down from ancient times\r\n(see p. 300).\r\n\r\nSalampandai is the maker of men. He hammers them into shape out of\r\nclay, and forms the bodies of children to be born into the world. There\r\nis an insect which makes at night the curious noise—_kink-a-clink,\r\nkink-a-clink_. When the Dyaks hear this, they say it is Salampandai at\r\nhis work. The story goes that he was commanded by the gods to make a man,\r\nand he made one of stone; but it could not speak, and so was rejected. He\r\nset to work again and made one of iron; but neither could that speak, so\r\nthe gods refused it. The third time he made one of clay,[1] and this had\r\nthe power of speech. The gods, _Petara_, were pleased, and said: “The man\r\nyou have made will do well. Let him be the ancestor of the human race,\r\nand you must make others like him.” And so Salampandai began forming\r\nhuman beings, and is forming them now at his anvil, using his tools in\r\nunseen regions. There he hammers them out, and when each child is formed\r\nit is brought to the _Petara_, who asks: “What would you like to handle\r\nand use?” If it answer, “A sword,” the gods pronounce it a male; but if\r\nit answer, “Cotton and the spinning-wheel,” it is pronounced a female.\r\nThus they are born as boys or girls, according to their own wishes.\r\n\r\nThere is a word which is often used by the Dyaks—_mali_. It is difficult\r\nto find an exact English equivalent to the word. We may say it means\r\n“sacred,” or “forbidden,” or “taboo,” but none of these seems to me\r\nto convey the full force of the word _mali_. To the Dyak mind, to do\r\nanything _mali_ is to incur the displeasure of the gods and spirits, and\r\nthat means not only misfortune in this world, but for all time. Even the\r\nchildren seem to dread the word, and the little boy, who is wilful and\r\ndisobedient, will at once drop what he has in his hand if he is told it\r\nis _mali_ for him to touch it. There are many things which the Dyaks say\r\nit is _mali_ to do. Often they can give no reason for it except that it\r\nhas always been so from ages past.\r\n\r\nMost races of mankind believe in the existence of a class of beings\r\nintermediate between deity and humanity. The Dyak is no exception, and he\r\nbelieves that innumerable spirits, or _antu_, inhabit the forests, the\r\nrivers, the earth, and the heavens; but whereas among other races the\r\nspirits seem to act as mediators between the gods and mankind, this is\r\nnot the case among the Dyaks, because they believe that their gods are\r\nactually present in answer to invocations and sacrifices, and that they\r\nvisit these human regions and partake of the food given them. With the\r\nDyaks the distinction between spirits—_antu_—and gods—_Petara_—is very\r\nvague. There are both good and evil spirits. The former assist man, the\r\nlatter do him injury. Of the gods no evil is predicated, and so it comes\r\nto pass that the good spirits are closely identified with their gods.\r\n\r\nAny unusual noise or motion in the jungle, anything which suggests to the\r\nmind some invisible operation, is at once attributed by the Dyak to the\r\npresence of some spirit, unseen by human eyes, but full of mighty power.\r\nThough generally invisible, these spirits sometimes vouchsafe to mankind\r\na revelation of themselves. The form they assume in these manifestations\r\nis not anything very supernatural, but either a commonplace human form,\r\nor else some animal—a bird, or a monkey—such as is often seen in the\r\nforests. There is, however, the chief of evil spirits, Girgasi by name,\r\nwho, when seen, takes the form of a giant about three times the size of a\r\nman, is covered with rough shaggy hair, and has eyes as big as saucers,\r\nand huge glittering teeth.\r\n\r\nThere are innumerable stories told by the Dyaks of their meeting with\r\nspirits in the jungle, and sometimes speaking to them. Such stories\r\ngenerally relate how the man who sees the spirit rushes to catch him by\r\nthe leg—he cannot reach higher—in order to get some charms from him, but\r\nhe is generally foiled in his attempt, as the spirit suddenly vanishes.\r\nBut some men, it is believed, do obtain these much coveted gifts. If a\r\nDyak gets a good harvest of paddy, it is attributed to some magic charm\r\nhe has received from some kindly spirit. Also, if he be successful on\r\nthe warpath, he is credited by his fellows with the succour of some\r\nmysterious being from the spirit-world.\r\n\r\nThe spirits rove about the jungle and hunt for wild beasts, as the Dyaks\r\ndo themselves. Girgasi, already mentioned, is specially addicted to the\r\nchase, and is often to be met with hunting in the forest, and when seen\r\nassumes a formidable appearance. There are certain animals which roam\r\nabout in packs in the jungle, and are called by the Dyaks _pasan_. These\r\nare supposed to be the dogs that accompany the spirits when they are out\r\nhunting, and they attack those whom the spirits wish to kill. I have\r\nnever seen one of these animals, but to judge from the description of\r\nthem, they seem to be a kind of small jackal. They will follow and bark\r\nat men, and from their supposed connection with the spirits are greatly\r\nfeared by the Dyaks, who generally run away from them as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nA Dyak in Banting solemnly told me that one day when out hunting he met a\r\nspirit in human form sitting upon a fallen tree. Nothing daunted, he went\r\nup and sat upon the same tree, and entered into conversation with him,\r\nand asked him for some charm. The spirit gave him some magic medicine,\r\nwhich would give his dogs pluck to attack any wild pig or deer so long as\r\nhe retained possession of it. Having given him this, the spirit advised\r\nthe man to return quickly, for his dogs, he said, would be back soon, and\r\nmight do him harm. This advice he willingly followed, and hurried away as\r\nfast as he could.\r\n\r\nThere are some wonderful stories related about meeting the demon Girgasi.\r\nIt is said that a man once saw this terrible spirit returning from the\r\nhunt, carrying on his back a captured Dyak whom he recognized. Strange\r\nto relate, the man died the same day on which he was seen carried by the\r\nspirit!\r\n\r\nThe spirits are said to build their invisible habitations in trees,\r\nand many trees are considered sacred as being the abode of one or more\r\nspirits, and to cut down one of these trees would provoke the spirits’\r\nvengeance. The wild fig-tree (_kara_) is often supposed to be inhabited\r\nby spirits. It is said that one way of testing whether the _kara_ tree is\r\nthe abode of spirits or not is to strike an axe into it at sunset, and\r\nleave it fixed in the trunk of the tree during the night. If the axe be\r\nfound next morning in the same position, no spirit is there; if it has\r\nfallen to the ground, he is there and has displaced the axe!\r\n\r\nThe tops of the hills are favourite haunts for spirits. When Dyaks fell\r\nthe jungle of the larger hills, they always leave a clump of trees at the\r\nsummit as a refuge for the spirits. To leave them quite homeless would be\r\nto court certain disaster from them. According to Dyak belief the evil\r\nspirits far outnumber the good ones.\r\n\r\nThere are many strange customs connected with the Dyak belief in spirits.\r\nAs all illnesses are caused by the spirits, it is necessary that these be\r\npropitiated. When there is any great epidemic in the country—when cholera\r\nor smallpox is killing its hundreds on all sides—one often notices little\r\nofferings of food hung on the walls and from the ceiling, animals killed\r\nin sacrifice, and blood splashed on the posts of the houses. When one\r\nasks why all this is done, they say they do it in the hope that when the\r\nevil spirit, who is thirsting for human lives, comes along and sees the\r\nofferings they have made and the animals killed in sacrifice, he will be\r\nsatisfied with these things, and not take the lives of any of the people\r\nliving in the Dyak village house.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, this offering of sacrifices to the evil spirits is\r\na frequently recurring feature in Dyak life. The gods are good, and will\r\nnot injure them, and so the Dyaks worship them at their own convenience,\r\nwhen they wish to obtain any special favour from them. But the evil\r\nspirits are always ready to do them harm, and to take the lives of\r\nvictims, and therefore sacrifices must constantly be made to the spirits,\r\nwho will accept sacrificial food as a substitute for the lives of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that the spirits are to the Dyaks\r\nnot mere apparitions which come and go without any special object, but\r\nhave definite power, and can either bestow favours or cause sickness\r\nand death. Therefore they rule the conduct of the Dyak, and receive\r\nreligious homage. They are, indeed, a constituent and important part of\r\nDyak religion.\r\n\r\nThe sacrifices offered by the Dyaks are of two kinds—_piring_ and\r\n_ginselan_.\r\n\r\nThe _piring_ is an offering composed of rice cooked in bamboos, cakes,\r\neggs, sweet potatoes, plantains, or other fruit, and sometimes small live\r\nchickens. If the offering be made in the house these things are put on\r\na brass dish (_tabak_). If the occasion of the sacrifice requires that\r\nit be offered elsewhere, a little platform is constructed, consisting of\r\npieces of wood tied together with cane, and fixed on four sticks stuck in\r\nthe ground. This is the _para piring_ (the altar of sacrifice), and the\r\noffering is laid on it. It is covered with a rough roof of palm-leaf, and\r\nlooks like a miniature native house, and is decorated with white flags.\r\nIt is the most flimsy thing imaginable, and soon tumbles to pieces. The\r\ngod or spirit is supposed to come and eat the good things provided, and\r\ngo away contented. It is no use arguing with the Dyak that he can see for\r\nhimself that his offering is eaten up by fowls, or pigs, or boys, who are\r\nfull of mischief, and have no fear of spirits. The Dyak says the spirits\r\neat the soul or spirit of the food; what is left on the altar is only its\r\nouter husk, not its true essence.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was staying at Temudok the Dyaks put up a little shed,\r\nwith offerings of food, at the landing-place on the bank of the river.\r\nThere was an epidemic of cholera at the time, and the spirits of disease\r\nwere supposed to eat these offerings and go away contented. Among the\r\nofferings was a little live chicken, that was tied to the _para piring_,\r\nbut which managed to get loose. Some of the schoolboys staying with me\r\nasked if they might catch the chicken, which was running about in the\r\ngrass, and rear it. I did not like to allow them to do this, because I\r\nthought the Dyaks would resent the boys interfering with their sacrifice.\r\nBut my Dyak catechist told me that the Dyaks had done their duty in\r\nmaking the offerings, and what happened afterwards to the things offered\r\ndid not matter. So the boys caught the chicken and reared it. I spoke to\r\nthe Dyaks about it afterwards, and they did not seem to mind their “altar\r\nof sacrifice” being robbed of its offering!\r\n\r\nIn the _ginselan_ there is always some animal slain, and the blood of\r\nthe victim is used. The person on whose behalf the offering is made\r\nis sprinkled or touched with the blood to atone for any wrong he may\r\nhave done, and the house or farm upon which the blessing of the gods is\r\ndesired is also sprinkled with the blood.\r\n\r\nThis kind of sacrifice is very often offered on behalf of farms, and no\r\nDyak thinks his paddy will come to maturity without some application of\r\nblood. The fowl is waved in the air over the farm, then it is killed, and\r\nthe blood sprinkled over the growing paddy.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an epidemic, the _ginselan_ is often offered to the spirits\r\nof disease, and blood is sprinkled on the posts of the house and on the\r\nladder leading up to it.\r\n\r\nOn most occasions the victim of the sacrifice, be it pig or fowl,\r\nis afterwards eaten. But if the sacrifice be to Pulang Gana at the\r\ncommencement of the farming, the pig and other offerings are conveyed\r\nwith the beating of gongs to the land prepared for receiving the seed.\r\nThe pig is killed, its liver and gall examined for divination, the body\r\nand other offerings put in the ground, and some _tuak_ (native spirit)\r\npoured upon them; a long invocation is then made to Pulang Gana, the god\r\nof the land. If a fowl be sacrificed for adultery, its body is thrown\r\naway in the jungle.\r\n\r\nFor all ordinary sacrifices a fowl suffices, but on great occasions a\r\npig, being the largest animal the Dyak domesticates, is killed.\r\n\r\nAnyone may offer these sacrifices. There does not seem to be among the\r\nDyaks any priestly order whose duty it is to officiate at religious\r\nceremonies. Any man who has been fortunate in life, or knows the form of\r\naddress to be used to the deities on these occasions, may perform the\r\nsacrificial function.\r\n\r\nAll that the Dyak hopes to get by his religious ceremonies is material\r\nbenefits—good crops of paddy, the heads of his enemies, skill in craft,\r\nhealth, and prosperity. Even when there is some idea of the propitiation\r\nfor sin, as in the slaying of a victim after an act of adultery, the idea\r\nof the Dyak is not so much the cleansing of the offender as the appeasing\r\nof the anger of the gods, because in their anger the gods may destroy\r\ntheir crops or otherwise give them trouble. There is no idea of seeking\r\nfor pardon for the offenders. It is merely a compensation for wrong done,\r\nand a bargain with the gods to protect their material interests.\r\n\r\nThe longing to communicate with the supernatural is common to all races\r\nof mankind. The Dyak has a special means of bringing this about; he has\r\na custom which is called _nampok_. To _nampok_ is to sleep on the top of\r\nsome mountain, or other lonely place, in the hope of meeting some good\r\nspirit from the unseen world. A cemetery is a favourite place to _nampok_\r\nin, because the Dyaks think there is great probability of meeting spirits\r\nin such places. The undertaking requires considerable pluck. The man must\r\nbe quite alone, and he must let no one know of his whereabouts. The\r\nspirit he meets may take any form; he may come in human form and treat\r\nhim kindly, or he may assume a hideous form and attack him.\r\n\r\nA man _nampoks_ for one of two reasons. Either he is fired with great\r\nambition to shine in deeds of strength and bravery, and to attain the\r\nposition of a Chief, and hopes to receive some charm (_pengaroh_) from\r\nthe spirits, or he is suffering from some obstinate disease, and hopes to\r\nbe told by some kindly spirit what he must do in order to be cured. It\r\ncan easily be understood how the desire would in many cases bring about\r\nits own fulfilment. The unusual surroundings, the expected arrival of\r\nsome supernatural being, the earnest wish acting upon a credulous and\r\nsuperstitious imagination in the solemn solitude of the jungle—all would\r\nhelp to make the man dream of some spirit or mythical hero.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak has no temple erected in honour of some god to which, like the\r\nancients of the Western World, he can make a pilgrimage. He has no altar\r\nbefore which he can spend the night in order to receive revelations in\r\ndreams, but he goes instead to the lonely mountain-top, or the cemetery\r\nwhere so many heroes of the past have been buried, and makes his offering\r\nand lies to rest beside it. The circumstances are different, but the\r\nspirit and the object in both cases are the same. The story often told of\r\na miraculous cure is also similar in each case.\r\n\r\nThere are certain rocks in different parts of Borneo which are called by\r\nthe Dyaks _batu kudi_ (stones caused by the wrath of the gods). A story\r\nis related in connection with each. The following are some of these\r\nmythical stories:—\r\n\r\n1. In the bed of the Sesang River there is a rock which is only visible\r\nat the lowest of the ebb-tide. It is called _Batu Kudi Sabar_. The story\r\ngoes that in olden days the inmates of a Dyak house tied to a dog’s tail\r\na piece of wood, which they set alight. They all laughed at the sight as\r\nthe dog ran off in fright, dragging after him the burning torch. Suddenly\r\nthere was darkness, and a great storm came on. There were thunder and\r\nlightning, and torrents of rain, and the house and its inmates were\r\nturned into this large rock. A family consisting of three persons managed\r\nto escape. They did not join in the laughter at the dog, but ran out of\r\nthe house and hid in a clump of bamboo. They saw all that happened, and\r\ntold the tale.\r\n\r\n2. On the bank of the Krian River just above Temudok is a large rock\r\ncalled _Batu Kudi Siap_. It is said that the people in a long Dyak house\r\nheld a feast to which many invited guests came. An old woman who was\r\nliving alone in a farm-hut, and had not been asked to the feast, dressed\r\nup a cat in finery, “like a young damsel going to a feast,” tied a piece\r\nof wood to her tail, and, placing her before the people, said: “Here is\r\na girl come to you to ask for a light.” The people laughed at the cat.\r\nInstantly there were darkness and a terrible storm, and the house and all\r\nthe inmates were turned to stone. A similar tale is told of the _Batu\r\nKudi_ at Selanjan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RIVER SCENE\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows some native huts by a river which flows through a\r\ncocoanut plantation.]\r\n\r\n3. There are _Batu Kudi_ in the Grenjang River, as well as in the Undup\r\nand Batang Ai Rivers, of which the following tale is told: Two girls were\r\nstanding in the water catching fish with a fishing-basket (_pemansai_).\r\nA small _emplasi_ fish jumped out of the basket, and hit the breast of\r\none of the girls. She laughed, and said: “Even my lover would not dare to\r\ntouch my breast as you do.” Her companion also laughed at the fish. There\r\nwas a storm, accompanied by lightning and thunder, and both girls were\r\nturned into rocks.\r\n\r\n4. In the Saribas River there is a _Batu Kudi_, of which the following\r\ntale is told: Some men and boys were watching a monkey crossing the river\r\non a creeper which hung low down over the water. The tail of the animal\r\ntouched the water, and one of them laughed, and said: “The end of his\r\nwaist-cloth (_sirat_) is wet; why was he so foolish as not to tie it\r\nround his waist?” At this remark all laughed, and a terrible storm came\r\non, and they were turned to stone.\r\n\r\nThere is a similarity about all these stories. In each some animal is\r\nmade fun of and laughed at by human beings. This incurs the displeasure\r\nof the gods, whose anger is shown in the same way—a terrible storm,\r\nthunder and lightning, and the turning of the offenders into stone.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other _Batu Kudi_ of which different stories are\r\ntold, but these are not so common. For instance, in the Skrang River\r\nthere are two large black boulders which are said to be a brother and\r\nsister who were guilty of the crime of incest; and in the Sebuyau River\r\nthere is a collection of rocks said to be the inhabitants of a whole\r\nvillage, who were guilty of a serious breach of the law of hospitality,\r\nand refused to give food and shelter to some travellers.\r\n\r\nThe moral of these mythical tales is good. All sin is displeasing to the\r\ngods, and will meet with deserved punishment, but specially are they\r\nangry when they see human beings ill-treat and ridicule dumb animals.\r\n\r\nThese _Batu Kudi_ are not worshipped. Offerings of food are sometimes\r\nseen hanging near them, but these are not made to the “stones of wrath,”\r\nbut to the gods of whose displeasure they are the testimony.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyak belief in a future life has already been mentioned in the\r\nchapter on Burial Rites. But it is no gloomy Tartarus, nor is it a happy\r\nElysium, that lies before him. It is simply a prolongation of the present\r\nstate of things in a new sphere. The dead are supposed to build houses,\r\nmake paddy farms, and go through all the drudgery of a labouring life in\r\nthat other world. This future life does not, in the mind of the Dyak,\r\nmean immortality. Death is still the final and inevitable destiny of man.\r\nHe may live many lives in different spheres—he may die as often as seven\r\ntimes—but in the end he becomes annihilated, and absorbed into air, or\r\nearth, or certain jungle plants.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the Sea Dyak worships his gods. There are good spirits ready\r\nto help him, and evil spirits eager to harm him. He has omens and\r\ndivination and dreams to encourage or warn him. The traditions of his\r\nancestors, handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation,\r\nare his authority for his beliefs. He makes sacrifices to the gods and\r\nspirits, and invokes their help in long incantations. He believes he\r\nhas a soul which after death will live in another world a future life\r\ndiffering little from his existence in the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDYAK FEASTS\r\n\r\n    Four classes of feasts—Preparations—Feasts connected\r\n    with: 1, Head-taking; 2, Farming; 3, The dead; 4, Dreams,\r\n    etc.—House-warming—Social feasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyak religious feasts may be divided into the four following classes:\r\n\r\nThose connected with—\r\n\r\n    1. Head-taking.\r\n    2. Farming.\r\n    3. The dead.\r\n    4. Dreams, etc.\r\n\r\nThough the Dyak feasts differ in their aims, there is a great deal\r\nwhich seems to be common to them all. The social character of all these\r\nfeasts seems to be of more importance than the religious aspect, and\r\nthe feasting of the guests has more consideration than the making of\r\nofferings to the spirits or gods. In none of these feasts does there\r\nseem to be any real, reverential, religious worship. It is true food is\r\noffered to the spirits, but this is done as the mere observance of an\r\nancient custom, without any approach to religious reverence. There are\r\nalso long incantations made to the higher powers by men selected for that\r\npurpose, who have good memories and can recite in a monotonous chant the\r\nspecial hymns of great length connected with each feast. But the guests\r\ndo not share in it as an act of religious worship. They are generally\r\nsitting round, talking and laughing and eating. While these incantations\r\nare sung, topics of common interest are discussed and plans formed, and\r\nin all these feasts sociability, friendship, and the partaking of food\r\nand drink seem to take a more prominent place than any religious worship.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for all these feasts are much alike. They extend over\r\na length of time, and consist for the most part in the procuring of\r\nfood for the guests. The young men go to their friends, far and near,\r\nand obtain from them presents of pigs or fowls for the feast, and as\r\ncock-fighting is loved by the Dyaks, they at the same time procure as\r\nmany fighting-cocks as possible. The women busy themselves with pounding\r\nout an extra amount of rice, both for the consumption of the guests and\r\nalso for the making of _tuak_, or native spirit.\r\n\r\nA little before the date fixed for the feast a great _tuba_ fishing takes\r\nplace, by which means a great amount of fish is generally obtained,\r\nsalted, and kept for consumption at the feast. The men go out into the\r\njungle to hunt for pig and deer.\r\n\r\nThe special characteristics and religious aspect of the different feasts\r\nmust now be noticed.\r\n\r\n1. FEASTS CONNECTED WITH HEAD-TAKING.—All these are given in honour of\r\nSingalang Burong. He is supposed to be the ruler of the spirit-world\r\nand the god of war. These feasts are not held so frequently as those\r\nconnected with farming, but when any of them take place a great deal is\r\nmade of the event.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCK FIGHTING\r\n\r\nA rehearsal. Two Dyak youths matching their cocks in friendly contest.]\r\n\r\n1. _Gawai Burong_ (the “Bird Feast”), or _Gawai Tenyalang_ (the “Hornbill\r\nFeast”), or _Gawai Pala_ (the “Head Feast”). This feast, which is known\r\nby different names, is the most important of Dyak feasts, and lasts three\r\ndays, whereas other feasts last only one day. In this feast food is given\r\nto the human heads taken in war. In the old days, it was only held on the\r\nreturn from a successful war expedition, when the heads of the enemy were\r\nbrought home in triumph. But in the present day, this feast is organized\r\nwhen the people of the Dyak house get a good harvest and wish to have it.\r\n\r\nAmong the preparations for this feast is the making of the _tenyalang_,\r\na carved wooden figure of the rhinoceros hornbill. Some men carrying\r\nofferings, and others beating drums and playing musical instruments, go\r\nto the jungle and select a suitable tree. At the foot of it the offerings\r\nare placed, and some fowls are killed and the blood sprinkled on the\r\nground to propitiate the spirits. The tree is felled, and a portion\r\nof it, which is to be carved, is taken to the Dyak house, where it is\r\nreceived with much rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThis wood is given to the men who are to carve it into the desired shape,\r\nand each man has the necessary tools given him. When he has finished\r\nhis work, he keeps these tools, and, in addition, receives some other\r\npayment. The number of carved birds differs according to the number of\r\nthe people in the house who are of importance, and have taken heads in\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nThe _tenyalang_ are not an exact copy of the hornbill, but are\r\nelaborately and fantastically carved and gorgeously painted in many\r\nbright colours.\r\n\r\nSome men go into the jungle and cut down _belian_ trees to make poles on\r\nwhich the figures of the rhinoceros hornbill are to be set up. These are\r\nof different lengths, according to the rank of the person who intends to\r\nuse it, the man of greatest importance having the longest pole.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the feast is spent in completing the carving and the\r\ncolouring of these _tenyalang_ and making other final preparations. The\r\nguests are entertained with food and drink. As Dyak hosts are considered\r\nniggardly if there is no drunkenness at a feast, the young men are\r\nencouraged to drink as much as possible. The Dyak girls, who do not drink\r\nthemselves, serve out the _tuak_, or native spirit. They hand a cup of\r\nliquor to a man and shout, “_Weh! Weh!_” as he drinks it. When he has\r\nfinished it, he puts the cup down by his side to take home with him when\r\nthe feast is over. Another full cup is handed to him in the same manner,\r\nand he goes on drinking until he is unable to do so any longer. A group\r\nof young men seated in the public hall of the Dyak house surrounded by\r\ngaily-dressed girls serving them with drink is not a pleasant sight. The\r\nnoise and confusion are great, as many are drunk. Plates containing cakes\r\nand other delicacies, as well as rice cooked in bamboos, are handed round\r\nto the men, women, and children at short intervals.\r\n\r\nA rather pretty ceremony takes place on the first day of the feast.\r\nA number of women dressed in their best garments and wearing all the\r\njewellery and ornaments they possess, walk in single file, holding in\r\ntheir hands plates of yellow rice and paddy. They are led by a Dyak\r\ndancer in full war-dress, armed with sword and shield, and dancing to the\r\naccompaniment of musical instruments. The women sprinkle the paddy and\r\nyellow rice on the assembled guests as they walk slowly the length of the\r\nwhole house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE DYAK GIRLS DRESSED IN THEIR FINERY TO ATTEND A FEAST\r\n\r\nThe girls on the right and left wear collars worked with beads and\r\ncoloured threads. They are all wearing ear pendants and belts made of\r\nsilver coins.]\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the feast the painted figures of the rhinoceros\r\nhornbill are first of all _timanged_, or sung to in a monotonous manner.\r\nThis is looked upon as a kind of consecration of them. They are now\r\nready to be fixed on the top of the poles which are planted in a row.\r\nSacrifices are made to Singalang Burong, whom these figures are supposed\r\nto represent. Balls of rice are thrown up to these carved _tenyalang_,\r\nand the blood of pigs and fowls is shed in honour of the great Singalang\r\nBurong, the god of war and the inspirer of bravery. When seen, this god\r\ntakes, as I have said, the form of the white and brown hawk so common in\r\nBorneo. Why the figure made to represent him is that of the rhinoceros\r\nhornbill, and not that of the hawk, is an inconsistency for which the\r\nDyaks have no explanation.\r\n\r\nSome human heads are placed in large brass dishes in the public hall of\r\nthe Dyak house, and to these offerings of food and drink are made. Some\r\nof this food is stuffed into the mouths of these heads, and the rest is\r\nplaced before them.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain erections called _pandong_ put up at regular\r\nintervals in the long public veranda, and to these are hung war charms\r\nand swords and spears, etc. The men who are to make the incantations\r\nwalk up and down, going round the _pandong_ and the heads in the brass\r\ndishes, singing the particular _pengap_, or incantation, which is used\r\nat this feast. There are generally two principal singers, each of whom\r\nis followed by five or six others. The leaders sing in turn a few lines,\r\nand the rest join in the chorus at the end of each verse. The leaders are\r\ndressed gaily, and have, in addition to their Dyak dress, a long coat\r\nreaching to the ground. They all hold long walking-sticks in their hands\r\nand stamp their feet as they walk along.\r\n\r\nThis song of the head feast takes the form of a story setting forth\r\nhow the mythical hero Klieng held a head feast on his return from the\r\nwarpath, and invited the god of war, Singalang Burong, to attend it. It\r\ndescribes at great length all that happened on that occasion. The singing\r\nof this song takes up the whole night. It begins before 8 p.m., and lasts\r\ntill next morning. Except for a short interval for rest in the middle of\r\nthe night, the performers are marching and singing all the time.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the people go out on the _tanju_, or open-air platform,\r\nin front of the Dyak house. They take with them offerings of food and\r\ndrink and a live pig. The mats are spread out, and the guests sit down,\r\nand food is handed round to them. The men of rank and those who have\r\ndistinguished themselves in battle sit together, and the oldest of these\r\nis asked to make the offering to Singalang Burong. The drums are struck\r\nin a particular manner called _pepat_; the pig is killed as a sacrifice,\r\nand the liver examined to find out whether good or bad fortune is in\r\nstore for them. The people shout together (_manjong_) at short intervals\r\nuntil a hawk is seen flying in the heavens. That hawk is Singalang\r\nBurong, who has taken that form to manifest himself to them. He has\r\naccepted their offerings and has heard their cry. The ceremony is over,\r\nand the crowd return into the house. The guests go back to their homes\r\nafter feasting and drinking liberally for three days and nights.\r\n\r\n(2) _Gawai Ijok_ (the “_Ijok_ Feast”): The _ijok_ is the gamuti palm\r\nfrom which the native drink _tuak_ is obtained. When a man has held\r\nthe hornbill feast several times, and has been successful against the\r\nenemy, this feast sometimes takes place. The special characteristic of\r\nthis feast is that a long pole is set up, and at the top of it a jar of\r\nnative spirit (_tuak_) is placed. Incantations and offerings are made to\r\nSingalang Burong as in the former feast.\r\n\r\n(3) _Gawai Gajah_ (the “Elephant Feast”): This feast can only be held by\r\na war leader who has been particularly successful against the enemy, and\r\nhas succeeded in obtaining a large number of heads. It is of so great\r\nimportance that the Dyaks say that, after this feast has been held, no\r\nother need be held in honour of any new heads that may be brought into\r\nthe house. It is very rarely observed in modern times. The last was\r\nheld some fifteen years ago by Kinching, a Skrang Dyak living in the\r\nUndup. Offerings and incantations are made to Singalang Burong as in the\r\n_Tenyalang_ feast. The wooden figure of an elephant is placed on the top\r\nof a long pole planted in the ground, and to this figure offerings are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n2. The three principal FEASTS CONNECTED WITH FARMING are the _Gawai\r\nBatu_, the _Gawai Benih_, and the _Gawai Nyimpan Padi_.\r\n\r\n(1) _Gawai Batu_ (the “Stone Feast”): This feast takes place before the\r\nfarming operations begin, and is in honour of Pulang Gana, the god of\r\nthe land, who lives in the bowels of the earth, and has power to make\r\nthe land fruitful or unfruitful. In this feast invocations are made to\r\nthis god, and he is asked to give them a good harvest. The whetstones\r\nand farming implements are placed in a heap in the veranda of the Dyak\r\nhouse, and offerings are made to the whetstones with a request that they\r\nmay sharpen their tools and thus lighten their labours. After the feast\r\nis over the whetstones are taken to the different farms, and the work of\r\ncutting down the jungle for planting begins.\r\n\r\n(2) _Gawai Benih_ (the “Seed Feast”): This feast is held just before\r\nsowing. The seed is placed in baskets in the public part of the Dyak\r\nhouse, and Pulang Gana is asked to bless it and make it fruitful.\r\n\r\n(3) _Gawai Nyimpan Padi_ (the “Feast of Storing the Paddy”): This is held\r\nafter the reaping and winnowing are over and the paddy is ready to be\r\nstored in the paddy-bins in the loft of the Dyak house. It is only held\r\nwhen the harvest is a particularly good one. A blessing is asked upon\r\nthe paddy, that it may last a long time, and may not decrease in any\r\nmysterious way. Friends who are invited to the feast help to carry and\r\nstore away the paddy.\r\n\r\n3. The great FEAST CONNECTED WITH THE DEAD is the _Gawai Antu_ (the\r\n“Spirit Feast”): No definite period is fixed for the celebration of it,\r\nand it may be held one or more years after the death of the person. All\r\nthose that have died since the last time the feast was held, and have not\r\nyet been honoured by this festival for the dead, are remembered at the\r\nsame time, so that the number of departed spirits commemorated by this\r\nfeast is great, especially if it is many years since the last time the\r\nfeast was held.\r\n\r\nThe preparation is carried on for many weeks. Food and drink and other\r\nthings are procured. Distant friends are visited and asked to help\r\nthe feast with gifts of food or money. When all is ready, the whole\r\nneighbourhood for miles around is invited to it. It is an opportunity for\r\na friendly social gathering, and it is a formal laying aside of mourning,\r\nbut in addition, it is a religious ceremony, and means the doing of\r\ncertain things necessary for the final wellbeing of the dead in the other\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe dead are invoked and invited to be present at this feast. But how\r\nare they to come from Hades? Send a boat for them, says the Dyak, and so\r\nhe sends what he calls a _lumpang_. A piece of bamboo in which rice has\r\nbeen cooked is make into a tiny boat and sent to Hades. Actually it is\r\nthrown away beneath the house, but spiritually, through the incantation\r\nof the wailer, it is carried to the unseen realm to fetch their dead\r\nrelatives and friends. Great is the joy of the spirits when they see this\r\nboat, which by the time of its arrival has grown into a large war-boat.\r\nThey are ready to start as soon as the final summons comes.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the feast go on. The hard wood memorial monuments\r\nfor the graves are got ready by the men. The day before the feast, the\r\nwomen weave, with finely-split bamboo, small imitations of various\r\narticles of personal and domestic use, and these are hung over the\r\ngraves—that is to say, given to the dead for their use in the other\r\nworld. If it be a man for whom the feast is made, a bamboo gun, a shield,\r\na war-cap, and such things are woven; if a woman, a loom, a fish-basket,\r\na winnowing fan, etc.; if a child, toys of various kinds.\r\n\r\nAn offering of food is put outside the house for the dead visitors who\r\nmay be too hungry to wait for the food in the house.\r\n\r\nThe living guests arrive during the day, but the feasting does not begin\r\ntill the evening. Before the feasting comes the formal putting off of\r\nmourning. The nearest male relative of the dead person in whose honour\r\nthe feast is held comes dressed in an old waist-cloth or trousers. These\r\nare slit through by some Chief, and the man assumes a better garment.\r\nIn the case of female relatives the _rotan_ rings round the waist are\r\ncut through and set aside, and they resume the use of their personal\r\nornaments and jewellery. The bundles containing the finery, that were put\r\naway at the death of their relative, are brought forth, and the string\r\ntying them cut through. As the feast is in honour of several who have\r\ndied since the feast was last held, this kind of thing goes on in several\r\nof the rooms at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe professional wailer sings her song of mourning (see p. 228),\r\nbeginning in the evening. The journey from Hades is so long that the dead\r\ndo not arrive till early dawn. And then occurs an action in which the\r\ndead and living are supposed to join. A portion of _tuak_ (rice spirit)\r\nhas been reserved in a bamboo as the peculiar portion of the dead. It\r\nis now drunk by some old man renowned for bravery, who is not afraid of\r\nso near a contact with the spirits of the dead. This “drinking of the\r\nbamboo,” as it is called, is an important part of the festival, and is\r\ngreeted with shouts of joy.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the feast, the last duty to the dead is performed. The\r\nironwood monuments, the bamboo imitation articles, and food of all kinds\r\nare arranged upon the different graves. Having received these gifts,\r\nthe dead relinquish all claim upon the living, and depend on their own\r\nresources. But before the _Gawai Antu_ they are supposed to come to the\r\nhouse and take their share of the food and drink.\r\n\r\nAccording to ancient custom, this feast could not be held until a new\r\nhuman head had been procured, but this ghastly ornament to the festival\r\nhas now generally to be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n4. A superstitious people like the Dyaks, living in constant dread of\r\nunseen powers, naturally hold a feast whenever anything unusual takes\r\nplace. As the gods and spirits are supposed to communicate their wishes\r\nto human beings by means of dreams, it naturally follows that if a man\r\ndreams that some spirit is hungry and asks for food, at once a feast\r\nis held, and offerings made to that spirit. As the omens of birds are\r\nobserved and obeyed by the Dyaks, and the special omen birds are looked\r\nupon as sons-in-law and messengers of the great god Singalang Burong,\r\nwhen a bird of ill omen comes into a Dyak house, the Dyaks hold a feast\r\nand make offerings to the gods and spirits. When a man has recovered from\r\na long and dangerous illness, very often a feast is held to thank the\r\nspirit of disease for leaving them, and to beg him to stay away a long\r\ntime. Also when a valuable jar (_tajau_) is brought into a house a feast\r\nis often made in its honour.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all these feasts, there is the _Gawai Mandi Rumah_. This\r\nis a kind of house-warming, and is held when the Dyaks go into a new\r\nhouse. Offerings are made to the gods and spirits, and a blessing is\r\nasked upon the new house, so that those who live in it may have good\r\ncrops, good health, and live happily together.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks also sometimes hold feasts which are social gatherings for\r\neating and drinking, and have no connection with any religious idea.\r\nThese are called _Makai di ruai_ (“eating in the hall”), or _Makai rami_\r\n(“eating joyfully in large numbers”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSPORTS AND AMUSEMENTS\r\n\r\n    Dyak games—Football—War Dance—Sword Dance—Dyak\r\n    music—Cock-fighting—Tops—“Riding the tidal\r\n    bore”—Swimming—Trials of strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt certain times of the year the Dyaks are very busy at their farms, and\r\ngo to work early in the morning, and do not return till late at night.\r\nBut they have their slack times, when there is not so much work to be\r\ndone, and then they have plenty of opportunity to indulge in games.\r\n\r\nThey do not seem to have a large variety of pastimes. The following are\r\nthose most popular among them.\r\n\r\nFootball is played by the Dyaks in a curious manner. The players stand\r\nin a circle about four yards from each other, the size of this circle\r\nvarying according to the number of the players. The ball is kicked in\r\nthe air by the player to whom it falls nearest. This kicking is done\r\nin a curious manner with the sole of the foot. A party of good players\r\nwill keep a ball in the air for several minutes, each player kicking it\r\nupwards just as it is about to fall, or as it bounds upwards from the\r\nground. The ball itself is a light hollow one of rattan open-work, and is\r\nabout the size of a croquet-ball.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are fond of dancing, and at their feasts and on other\r\noccasions when many are met together, they will keep it up for hours to\r\nthe thumping of drums and the beating of brass gongs. They have a musical\r\ninstrument of bamboo, like the pan-pipe (_engkrurai_), to which they\r\nsometimes dance; but the usual music on such occasions is a row of small\r\nbrass gongs (_engkrumong_), placed on the ground, and beaten with two\r\nsticks, also large brass gongs, and a variety of drums.\r\n\r\nThe two popular dances are the Sword Dance and the War Dance, both of\r\nwhich are danced by the men. It is very rarely that the women dance. I\r\nam told that they only do so when a fighting-party have been successful,\r\nand return with a human head which has been taken in war. Then the\r\nwomen, dressed up in all their finery, go to the landing-stage where the\r\nwar-boat is, and as the head is taken to the house the women dance around\r\nit singing a monotonous chant.\r\n\r\nThe _Mencha_, or Sword Dance, is danced in the following manner: Two\r\nswords, or in their place two sticks, are placed on the mat, and the two\r\ndancers commence from the opposite ends, turning the body, clapping the\r\nhands, and extending the arms, lifting their feet and planting them down\r\nin grotesque but not ungraceful attitudes. For a few minutes they posture\r\nand move in leisurely manner round and round about; then they seize the\r\nswords, and pass and repass each other, now cutting, now crossing swords,\r\nretiring and advancing. Sometimes one kneels as though to defend himself\r\nfrom the attacks of his adversary. The main idea of this Sword Dance\r\nseems to be the posturing in different attitudes, and not so much the\r\nskill displayed in fencing. Those are considered the best dancers who,\r\naccording to Dyak ideas, are the most graceful in their movements. I have\r\noften watched a Dyak Sword Dance where neither has touched the other\r\nwith his sword, the movements having been so leisurely that there has\r\nbeen plenty of time to ward off each attack.\r\n\r\nThe dance seems quite in keeping with the Dyak surroundings, and the\r\nwhole effect of it is very striking. The long veranda of the Dyak house\r\ndimly lighted up by _damar_ torches; the pretty silver tones of the small\r\nrow of brass _enkrumong_ struck by two sticks in fast measure; the deep\r\ntones of the large brass gongs; the numerous noisy drums; the crowd of\r\nspectators standing, sitting, or kneeling; the screams of encouragement\r\nto the dancers; the evolutions of the two performers—all help to form a\r\nweird and striking scene.\r\n\r\nThe _Ajat_, or War Dance, is danced by one man. He is generally fully\r\narmed with sword, and spear, and shield. He acts in pantomime what is\r\ndone when on the warpath. The dancer begins by imitating the creeping\r\nthrough the jungle in cautious manner, looking to the right and to the\r\nleft, before and behind, for the foe. The lurking enemy is suddenly\r\ndiscovered, and after some rapid attack and defence a sudden plunge is\r\nmade upon him, and he lies dead on the ground. The taking of the head of\r\nthis invisible enemy in pantomime now follows. A great deal of liberty\r\nis allowed the dancer, and the dances are very varied. Sometimes the\r\ndance ends with the defeat and death of the dancer. The last agonies of\r\nthe dying man are too closely and painfully depicted to be altogether\r\npleasant to watch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCK FIGHTING\r\n\r\nSometimes at feasts cock fighting takes place in the veranda of the Dyak\r\nhouse. At other times it takes place on the ground outside. Here two\r\nDyaks are matching their cocks against each other, while a crowd of men\r\nand boys stand around.]\r\n\r\nThe musical instruments which accompany the War Dance are much the same\r\nas those used for the Sword Dance. There are the _engkrumong_, or row of\r\nlittle brass gongs, the large gongs, and a variety of drums. But the\r\nmusic is in different time, the music for the War Dance being quicker\r\nthan that for the Sword Dance.\r\n\r\nCock-fighting is a very favourite amusement of the Dyaks, and is\r\nindulged in to a great extent at all their feasts. In fact, one of the\r\npreparations for a feast is for the inmates of the house to go round to\r\ntheir friends and beg for as many fighting-cocks as they can. The cocks\r\nhave artificial steel spurs, which are very sharp.\r\n\r\nSpinning tops is a favourite amusement, not only of the children, but\r\nalso of grown-up men. They generally divide themselves into two sides.\r\nOne side spin their tops, and the other party, standing at a given\r\ndistance, aim at the spinning tops with their tops. Great skill is shown\r\nin the manner in which a man often hits a top, driving it far away, and\r\nleaves his top spinning in its place.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very much at home on the water, and a favourite amusement\r\nof the Dyaks at Banting was to “ride the tidal bore.” During the\r\nspring-tides, when there was a tidal bore, they would paddle down the\r\nriver some distance, and wait for the turn of the tide. When the bore\r\ncame, they would get just in front of it, and the great wave would send\r\nthe boats up-river at a good pace without any paddling on their part. Of\r\ncourse, a great many boats were often swamped, but that only added to the\r\nfun. When I was stationed at Banting, the schoolboys often asked to be\r\nallowed to “ride the bore.”\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks seem to acquire naturally the art of swimming. They are\r\ntaken to the water regularly from infancy, and dipped and floated on the\r\nwater, and at an early age they are able to swim. They swim hand over\r\nhand. They never take “a header” in diving, but jump in feet foremost.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are fond of wrestling, and many of them are good wrestlers. At\r\na Dyak feast very often the young men have friendly wrestling matches.\r\nThey have also other trials of strength. Two young men sit on the ground\r\nopposite each other, feet placed against feet, and a stout stick is\r\ngrasped by both their hands. Each then tries to throw himself back, so as\r\nto raise his adversary from the ground either by main strength or sudden\r\neffort. Another trial of strength is to put two fingers of one opponent\r\nagainst two fingers of another, the elbows being placed upon a table or\r\nlog; then each party tries to force the other’s fingers backward. Or\r\nelse two stand up face to face, and each grasps the two first fingers of\r\nhis opponent, holding his arm up, so that their hands are the same level\r\nas their faces, and they each try by main force to lower the arm of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very fond of jumping, and at Banting, in the cool of the\r\nevening, the young men, returning with me from Evening Prayer in church,\r\nwould often try the long-jump or high-jump near the Mission House.\r\n\r\nThey also play a game called _galangang_, not unlike prisoners’ base. The\r\nplayers divide themselves into parties, and one party is set to watch\r\ncertain lines which the other party cross. If anyone is touched as he\r\ncrosses a line, his side loses, and has to do the watching.\r\n\r\nThe evening amusements are listening to some story, either set to verse\r\nand sung, or simply told in prose, and the asking each other riddles.\r\nThese riddles are generally rhyming verses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSONG AND MUSIC\r\n\r\n    Love of music—Love songs—Boat songs—War songs—Incantations at\r\n    Dyak feasts—The song of mourning—Musical instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks are very fond of singing, and it is no unusual thing to\r\nhear some solitary boatman singing as he paddles along. Weird beyond\r\nwords, and yet possessing a quaint rhythm, are most of the songs of the\r\nDyak. They give vent to their feelings in their own way, which is very\r\ndifferent from ours, but their plaintive songs are not unpleasant, and\r\nshow a certain amount of poetical feeling.\r\n\r\nThe _pelandai_, or love song, seems to be very popular among the young\r\nmen. In it the native singer pours forth his feelings, his sorrows and\r\ndisappointments, his hopes and his fears. The music is to our ideas\r\nmonotonous, and it is not always easy to understand the meaning of what\r\nis sung, as many archaic expressions are used, and the singer sometimes\r\ncalls his love by one name, sometimes by another; at one time she is\r\nspoken of as a bird, and then, in the next line perhaps, the name of some\r\nanimal is applied to her. A similar song sung by the women is called\r\n_bedungai_.\r\n\r\nThey have their boat songs, with which the crew of a long Dyak boat\r\noften enliven the time. The leader sings a verse, and the others join\r\nin the chorus, keeping time with the strokes of the paddle or oar. The\r\nleader often improvises his subject as he sings, and introduces any\r\nlittle incident that has taken place, or little experience they have gone\r\nthrough, much to the amusement of his companions.\r\n\r\nIn their war songs the singer chants in a low monotonous voice the deeds\r\nof heroes in the olden days, and how they won and brought home human\r\nheads to lay at the feet of their brides. These war songs are often\r\naccompanied by the excited whoops and yells of the listeners.\r\n\r\nThere is the _bernong_, usually sung by two singers, who take it in turns\r\nto sing a verse, and then the chorus is sung by both. This, as well as\r\nthe _pelandai_, or love song, may often be heard in the evening in the\r\nlong Dyak house.\r\n\r\nThen there is the _kana_, in which some legend or fairy-tale is sung by\r\nsomeone versed in ancient lore, as he sits on a swing in the dimly-lit\r\nveranda of the Dyak house.\r\n\r\nSinging also forms part of all their sacred rites. At all their\r\nceremonial feasts connected with warfare, farming, or the dead, the\r\nincantations, or _pengap_, as they are called, are in the form of Dyak\r\nverse, and sung. These songs differ considerably from the ordinary\r\nlanguage of the Dyak, and a person, who can understand and speak\r\nDyak, may yet find the _pengap_ most unintelligible. Native metaphor\r\nand most excessive verbosity, together with the use of many archaic\r\nexpressions, the meanings of which have long been forgotten, as well as\r\nthe introduction of many coined words, which mean nothing, and are simply\r\ndragged in because they rhyme with the words preceding—all these things\r\nare quite certain to mystify an uninstructed hearer. Another reason why\r\nit is so difficult to understand the _pengap_ is that the language used\r\nis that of many generations back. The _pengap_, being learnt by heart,\r\nand handed down with verbal accuracy from one generation to another, is\r\nin the language of the past, whereas the ordinary spoken language of the\r\nDyak is continually changing and developing new forms. There are a great\r\ndeal of alliteration in the _pengap_, a certain peculiar rhythm and a\r\nstring of rhyming words.\r\n\r\nThe presence of invisible beings is very strongly believed by the Dyak,\r\nand he is persuaded that spirits both good and bad are always round him.\r\nAs a form of invocation to these spirits, and in all the ceremonial\r\nfeasts of the Dyaks, as well as on other important occasions, the\r\n_pengap_ are sung, sometimes by one man seated on a swing, sometimes\r\nby a number of men, who walk up and down the long veranda, dressed in\r\nflowing robes, with a long staff in the right hand of each. From what\r\nhas been said it will be easily understood that there are a great number\r\nof different _pengap_ suited to different occasions. In each incantation\r\nsome special spirit or deity is more specially invoked.\r\n\r\nAt the Dyak Head Feast, Singalang Burong—the Mars of Dyak mythology—is\r\nspecially invoked to be present in the _pengap_ which is sung. In the\r\nfeasts connected with farming, Pulang Gana, the god of the soil, is\r\ninvoked, and asked to drive from their farms all rats and birds and\r\ninsects that may hurt the paddy. And at the feasts given in honour of\r\nthe dead all the spirits of dead relatives and friends, as well as those\r\nof mythical heroes, are invited to partake of the good things provided.\r\nThen, again, when the _manangs_, or Dyak witch-doctors, are called in to\r\ncure a sick man, they often walk round and round the sick man, and chant\r\na _pengap_, invoking Salampandai, the Great Spirit-Doctor, to come to\r\ntheir aid, and make their charms efficacious in bringing about the cure\r\nof the sick man.\r\n\r\nSome of the Dyak _pengap_ are of great length, and the singing of them\r\noccupies the whole night. The singer or singers begin soon after 8 p.m.,\r\nand go on till early dawn, only resting for about half an hour, two or\r\nthree times during the whole night.\r\n\r\nThe song of mourning is among some tribes sung by a professional wailer,\r\ngenerally a woman, who is paid to lament the lost, and by her presence\r\nand incantation to assist and guide the soul in its journey to Hades\r\n(_Sabayan_). Her song is begun on the evening of the death, and lasts\r\nthe whole night. The sum of it is this:—She blames the different parts\r\nof the house for allowing the soul to depart, and she calls upon bird,\r\nbeast, and fish to go to Hades with a message, but in vain, for they\r\nare unable to undertake the journey. Then in despair she calls upon\r\nthe Spirit of the Winds to go. At first the spirit is reluctant, but\r\nat the earnest request of the wailer, who calls his wife to her aid,\r\nhe at length consents to do her bidding. His journey through forests\r\nand plains, hills and valleys, across rivers and the sea, is minutely\r\ndescribed till night comes on, and, tired and hungry, he stops to rest\r\nfor the night. He climbs a high tree to see which is the proper road—on\r\nall sides there are roads: the ways of the dead are very numerous—but all\r\nis dim, misty, and uncertain. In his perplexity, he changes his human\r\nform, and metamorphoses himself into a rushing wind. He soon makes his\r\npresence in Hades known by a furious tempest, which sweeps all before it,\r\nand rouses the sleeping inhabitants. Startled, they ask each other what\r\nis the meaning of this great commotion. The Spirit of the Wind answers\r\nthat their presence is wanted in the land of the living. They must go and\r\nfetch a certain man and his belongings who wishes to come to Hades, but\r\ndoes not know the way, and needs someone to guide him. The dead rejoice\r\nat the summons. In a moment they collect together, get into a long boat,\r\nand paddle hurriedly through Limban, the Dyak Styx. When they arrive at\r\nthe landing-place, the dead make an eager rush for the house, and enter\r\nthe room of the dead man. The departed soul cries out in anguish at being\r\nthus suddenly and violently carried off, but long before the ghostly\r\nparty have reached their abode in Hades, he becomes reconciled to his\r\nfate. Such in brief outline is the song of the wailer. By her song she\r\nhas helped to convey the soul to its new home. Without her aid the soul\r\nwould be lost, and remain suspended in mid-air and find no rest.\r\n\r\nThe songs and incantations of the Dyaks are not set to any particular\r\nmelody. They are sung to a kind of chant, and long sentences are often\r\nrepeated on one note. But they have several distinct settings for the\r\ndifferent songs and incantations, and these seem to suit the subject. The\r\nsong of mourning, for instance, sounds very sad and pathetic even to one\r\nwho does not understand the language.\r\n\r\nThe musical instruments of the Dyaks are of a more or less primitive\r\ntype, but when played together, the result is not unpleasing. Those\r\nemployed as an accompaniment to the Sword Dance or the War Dance are\r\nbrass gongs of different sizes and a variety of drums. First there is the\r\ndeep-sounding brass _tawak_, the sound of which travels a great distance,\r\nand which, when struck in a peculiar manner, is the danger signal in\r\ntimes of war. Next in order of importance comes the smaller brass gong\r\nwhich is called the _chanang_, and lastly the _engkrumong_ of eight small\r\nbrass gongs of different sizes arranged in order in a long open box. The\r\nplayer of the _engkrumong_ has a stick in each hand, and strikes these\r\ndifferent gongs in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThey have numerous drums of different shapes and sizes. They are made of\r\ndifferent kinds of wood, with deer-skin or monkey-skin tightly stretched\r\nover one or both ends.\r\n\r\nThe effect of all these instruments of percussion played together is\r\ninspiring, and not at all displeasing. There is no harsh discordant\r\nclanging, as is so often the case in the music of primitive races. There\r\nare different ways of striking the drums and other instruments, and each\r\nof these ways has a distinctive name. The rhythm of the music of the\r\nSword Dance differs entirely from that of the War Dance, and for each of\r\nthese dances there are various different arrangements for the musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nAmong their wind instruments is the _engkrurai_, which is constructed\r\nof a number of bamboo tubes fixed in an empty gourd, the long stem of\r\nwhich forms the mouth-piece. All the notes can be sounded together, and\r\ncombinations of notes or single notes can be produced from it by shutting\r\nor opening finger-holes placed laterally at the lower end of the bamboo\r\ntubes. There are generally seven bamboo tubes, six of them arranged in\r\na circle round a larger and longer central one. All seven are furnished\r\nwith a reed at the base, where they are inserted into the gourd. Holes\r\nare cut in the six outer pipes for fingering. The central pipe is an open\r\nor drone-pipe, the tone of which is intensified by fixing a loose cap of\r\nbamboo on the upper end. It is played by blowing air into the neck of\r\nthe gourd, or by drawing in the breath, according to the effect desired.\r\nThe volume of sound is not great, and the music produced is not unlike\r\nthat of the Scotch bagpipes played very softly and very badly.\r\n\r\nThey have a flute, or rather flageolet (_ensuling_), made of bamboo, with\r\na plug at the mouth-hole. It is blown at the end, and there are three or\r\nfour finger-holes, so that different notes can be produced.\r\n\r\nAnother musical instrument is the _serunai_, or one-stringed fiddle.\r\nThe body is half a gourd-shell, the mouth of which is covered up with a\r\ncircular piece of soft wood, which is thin and close-fitting, the seams\r\nbeing cemented with wax. To this is fixed the stock, an arm about two\r\nfeet long made of hard wood. The bow is a bent cane, and the string\r\nof the bow a split rattan about a foot in length. The string of this\r\ninstrument is of the same material, and there is a peg at the end of\r\nthe stock by which the string can be tightened. There is a movable\r\nbridge on the belly of the instrument for the string to rest upon. The\r\nbody is sometimes made of half a cocoanut-shell instead of a gourd. The\r\nstring has to be wetted before it will sound, and then it gives forth a\r\nmonotonous, mournful, dismal sound when the bow is rubbed against it.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks also have a four-stringed zither. The strings are made of split\r\ncane, and are stretched over a wooden box of soft wood. This instrument\r\nvaries in shape and size, and is called the _engkratong_.\r\n\r\nThe _blikan_ is a rude guitar made of soft wood, with two strings of\r\nrattan and two pegs for tightening them. The strings are pressed with the\r\ntips of the fingers of the left hand to modify the tone, and the fingers\r\nof the right hand brush the strings. This instrument is about three feet\r\nlong from end to end.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, it will be seen that their musical\r\ninstruments, though various, are very primitive, and that, though the\r\nDyak is fond of music, his ideas on the subject are very crude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE DYAK ABROAD\r\n\r\n    Love of travel—“The innocents abroad”—Gutta-hunting—Collecting\r\n    canes—Hunting for edible birds’-nests—Camphor-working.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is fond of travel, and, like other people, loves to visit\r\nforeign countries and to return and relate his adventures to his\r\nstay-at-home friends. He is always at home in the jungle, and in whatever\r\ncountry he may be collecting jungle produce, he is in his element. But\r\nthis is by no means the case when he is in any foreign town. I have\r\nsometimes seen Dyaks in Singapore walking aimlessly about, quite out of\r\ntouch with their surroundings. I think they are looked upon as fair game\r\nby the Chinese shopkeepers in Singapore, who have no scruples in taking\r\nadvantage of their innocence, as the following incident will show.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I took some Dyaks from Banting on a visit to Singapore.\r\nI told them not to wander too far away from the house by themselves,\r\nas they might lose their way, and advised them to let me send someone\r\nwith them when they wanted to buy anything, because they had no idea\r\nof the price of things, and would probably be swindled by the Chinese\r\nshopkeepers. For the first few days they were very careful to do as\r\nI told them, but afterwards, they considered themselves experienced\r\ntravellers who could well manage to buy things for themselves. One day\r\nthey came to me and said they had met such a nice Chinese shopkeeper,\r\nfrom whom one of them had bought a silk jacket. He was such a pleasant\r\nman, and his things were so cheap, that they had quite made up their\r\nminds to visit his shop again. I asked to see the silk jacket they had\r\nbought. It was brought to me carefully wrapped up in Chinese brown paper,\r\nand the parcel, being opened, was found to contain a cotton jacket! When\r\nthe purchase was made, the “very pleasant shopkeeper” kindly bundled it\r\nup for them, and this was the result. I told them that they had been\r\ntaken in, and that there was no help for it, and that they must always be\r\non their guard against the Chinese shopkeeper. But my words were wasted.\r\nThey were quite positive that there was some mistake. It was quite absurd\r\nto imagine that such a nice Chinaman would think of swindling them. All\r\nthat had to be done was to go back to the shop and explain matters, and\r\neverything would be put right. They did go back to the shop, and returned\r\nwith long faces. The nice Chinaman said he did not remember selling them\r\na silk jacket; they must have mistaken the shop. Was there anything he\r\ncould sell them? Needless to say, they bought nothing more from that\r\nshop, and returned “sadder and wiser men.”\r\n\r\nGutta-hunting is a favourite method of the Dyaks for earning money.\r\nA party of them go to the Malay Peninsula, or Sumatra, or Java, and\r\nstay away for months or even years, and do not return until they have\r\naccumulated some hundreds of dollars. Before starting for such a journey\r\nthey have to consult the omen birds, and if these are favourable, they\r\nstart off with a little money for their expenses, taking with them the\r\nfew tools necessary for their work. They go to some town, and from it\r\nthey make journeys into the surrounding jungle, returning after intervals\r\nof a month or more to sell the gutta they have succeeded in obtaining,\r\nand to buy provisions.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the Dyak works gutta is this:—He wanders in the jungle\r\ntill he finds a gutta-tree. He cuts it down, and rings it neatly all\r\nalong the trunk and branches at intervals of a foot or two with a kind\r\nof hollow chisel that he brings with him for the purpose. Under each\r\nring he puts a leaf made into a cup to catch the milk-white sap which\r\nslowly exudes. Into each of these he puts a little scraped bark of the\r\ntree. Then he collects all the sap, and boils it until the gutta is\r\nprecipitated at the bottom of the pot like a mass of dough. This is taken\r\nout while it is still soft, placed upon a board, and kneaded vigorously\r\nwith the hands, and afterwards trodden with the bare feet. When it is\r\nalmost too stiff to work, it is flattened out carefully, and then rolled\r\ninto a wedge-shaped mass. A hole is punched through the thin end, through\r\nwhich a string is put to carry it, and it is ready for sale. This crude\r\ngutta has a mottled or marbled light brown appearance, which is given\r\nto it by the scraped bark which is mixed with it. The juice of the wild\r\nfig-tree (_Ficus_) or of the different species of bread-fruit trees\r\n(_Artocarpus_) is sometimes used to adulterate it.\r\n\r\nSometimes, instead of working gutta, the Dyaks earn money by collecting\r\ncanes, or _rotan_. A journey is made by a party of them to some jungle\r\nregion where canes abound, and they collect the various marketable\r\nspecies of the genus _Calamus_. These canes are creeping plants the\r\nstems of which are covered with a hard flinty bark. The leaves are very\r\nthorny, and cling to the trees and branches around. The older part of\r\nthe cane has no leaves. It is very tough and strong, and in size about\r\none-quarter of an inch in diameter. It is easily split, and used for the\r\nseats of chairs, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Dyaks join others in the collection of edible birds’-nests\r\nfor the Chinese market. This is a great industry in those parts of Borneo\r\nwhere there are large limestone caves, in which these nests are found.\r\nThe caves are farmed out by Government, and whatever is obtained over the\r\namount paid to Government is the profit of the workers. In Upper Sarawak\r\ncertain tribes possess caves in which edible birds’-nests are found, and\r\nthey divide the nests with the Government.\r\n\r\nSometimes Dyaks who wish to earn a little extra money go and help these\r\ntribes in collecting birds’-nests, and get a share of the profits, or\r\nmore often they go to small caves which belong to no one in particular\r\nand collect birds’-nests for themselves, and then give a share of what\r\nthey find to the Government.\r\n\r\nSome of the caves in which edible birds’-nests are found are very large.\r\nAt the entrance the visitor is met by thousands of bats and swallows.\r\nThe latter resemble the common swallow in appearance, but are only half\r\nas large. These small swallows make the edible nests. Inside, the cave\r\nis often like an immense amphitheatre roofed like a dome, the middle of\r\nwhich is over a thousand feet high. Thousands of nests are seen clinging\r\nto the pillar-like rocky sides and roof. The most flimsy-looking stages\r\nof bamboos tied together with cane are the simple means employed by\r\nthe natives to collect the nests from the seemingly most inaccessible\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThough there are rifts in the sides through which come rays of light,\r\nstill in parts the cave is so dark that lamps and torches have to be used.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks climb up the bamboo scaffolding, carrying with them long cane\r\nladders. These are fixed against the sides. Two men work on each ladder,\r\nwhich often hangs high up in the air. One carries a light four-pronged\r\nspear about fifteen feet long, and near the prongs a lighted candle is\r\nfixed. Holding on to the ladder with one hand, he manages the spear with\r\nthe other, and transfixes the nest. A slight push detaches it from the\r\nrock, and the spear is then held within reach of the second man, who\r\ndetaches the nest and puts it into a basket tied to his waist.\r\n\r\nThe natives say that there are two species of swallows that inhabit these\r\ncaves. Those that take up their abode near the entrance of the cave build\r\nnests which are of no value. These birds often attack the other and\r\nsmaller species which make the edible nests. The natives often destroy\r\nthe nests of the larger swallows, so as to lessen their number.\r\n\r\nThe best quality nests are very translucent, and of a pale yellow colour,\r\nand mixed with very few feathers. These are nests that have been freshly\r\nmade. If the nests are not removed, the birds make use of them again,\r\nso that by age and accession of dirt they become quite useless. The old\r\nnests are of no value, and the natives destroy them, so that the birds\r\nmay build new ones in their place.\r\n\r\nThe nests are collected four times a year. The natives say that the birds\r\nwill lay four times a year if their nests are collected often, but if\r\nthere are only two collections, then the birds only lay twice in the\r\nyear. The best time for collecting nests is when the eggs are just laid.\r\nOne would imagine that there would be a danger of over-collecting, and\r\nthat the number of birds would diminish; but the natives say there is\r\nno danger of this, as the birds carry on their breeding in nooks and\r\ncrannies inaccessible to the collectors.\r\n\r\nAnother jungle industry is the hunting for camphor. The kind the Dyaks\r\nobtain is known as “hard camphor,” and is found in crystals in the hollow\r\ntrunk of a tree. It is much more valuable than ordinary camphor.\r\n\r\nBefore going out to collect camphor, the Dyaks live in little huts in the\r\njungle, and listen to the omens of birds, just as they would do before\r\ngoing out gutta-hunting. If the omens be favourable, then they start\r\noff, being careful not to use in conversation certain words which are\r\nconsidered “taboo,” or _mali_. It is forbidden to use the word “camphor,”\r\nor to mention the names of the implements used in working it, or of any\r\nraces, such as the Chinese, Malays, or Europeans, because these will have\r\nsomething to do with the selling of the camphor later on. If the spirits\r\nwho own the camphor know what the men are after, or that their property\r\nis likely to be taken away and sold to distant lands, they will carefully\r\nhide it, and the camphor workers will never be able to find it; so the\r\nDyaks have to use other expressions to express the articles whose names\r\nmust not be mentioned. “Camphor” becomes “the thing that smells,” and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks, as well as the Malays, believe that to be careless and to\r\nmake use of any forbidden word is sure to result in failure to find\r\ncamphor. Even if a tree containing camphor is felled, they say that the\r\ncrystallized camphor will become liquid, and therefore useless.\r\n\r\nWhen a camphor-tree is found in the jungle it is chipped with an axe\r\nbetween two buttresses, and the wood smelt. If the wood smells very\r\nstrongly of camphor, then it is likely that the trunk is hollow, and\r\nthere is crystallized camphor-gum inside it. They tap the trunk to find\r\nout how far up this hollow extends. The tree is cut down at this place,\r\nand the stump remains standing. The wood is then split down on each\r\nside. There is a good deal of uncertainty in the finding of camphor. If\r\nlucky, the workers may find the whole of the hollow trunk from four to\r\nseven feet deep full of crystallized camphor. On the other hand, the hole\r\nin the wood may be quite empty, except for a little liquid gum at the\r\nbottom, which is useless. This crystallized camphor fetches a good price\r\nin the Chinese market. The Chinese value it very highly for medicinal\r\npurposes, and as much as fifty dollars or more is given for a _katty_—a\r\npound and a quarter—of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\n    The itinerant missionary—Visit to a Dyak\r\n    house—Reception—Cooking—Servants—The meal—Teaching the\r\n    Dyaks—Christians—Services—Prayer-houses—Offertory—Reception of\r\n    the missionary—Dangers of sea travelling during the north-east\r\n    monsoon—My boat swamped—In the jungle—Losing my way—A Dyak’s\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the long Dyak village houses are often built at great distances from\r\neach other, the missionary who wishes to do effective work among the\r\nDyaks must travel from house to house. Only by visiting distant villages,\r\nand living with the Dyaks as their guest, can the missionary learn to\r\nunderstand the people, and know their real inner life.\r\n\r\nLet me try and describe a visit to some Dyak house, which no missionary\r\nhas visited before, and where there is hope of breaking new ground. After\r\ntravelling by boat or on foot I come to the house, and at the foot of the\r\nladder leading up to it, one of my Dyak companions shouts out, “_Jadi\r\nrumah?_” (“Is the house tabooed?”—that is to say: “May we walk up?”) The\r\nusual answer is “_Jadi_,” which implies that there is no reason against\r\nour entering the house. We climb up the ladder leading to the common\r\nhall and walk to the middle of the house, where the headman and the more\r\nimportant inhabitants have their rooms. Some inmate spreads out mats for\r\nus, and we are asked to sit down.\r\n\r\nIf I arrive at the house early in the day, most of the men will probably\r\nbe out, and only women and children at home. These crowd round, standing\r\nat a respectful distance, and the wife or daughter of the headman asks\r\nus what we have come for, and invites us to stay in the house. She also\r\nclears away their own cooking from the fireplace, and my servant is asked\r\nto do whatever cooking is needed for the _Tuan_ in their room.\r\n\r\nThe cooking is generally a simple matter. The dinner generally consists\r\nof one course. My servant buys from the Dyaks a fowl—it would be libel to\r\ncall it a “chicken”!—and cooks it, or else he falls back on tinned food,\r\nof which I always had a supply.\r\n\r\nDuring all the years I worked in Borneo I always had a Dyak servant, and\r\nI was fortunate in having for many years an excellent native named Ah\r\nChoy. He was born at Banting, and attended the Mission School there, and\r\nthen went on to the school at Kuching. I joined the Mission Staff soon\r\nafter he left school, and he worked for me as my general factotum—cook,\r\nhousekeeper, boatman, personal attendant, etc.—for ten years or more. He\r\nwas, what is unusual among the Dyaks, a good cook, and, in addition to\r\nthis, was an excellent servant in many ways. He understood about boats,\r\nand I found his advice in all matters connected with travelling very\r\ntrustworthy. He had a good idea of carpentering, and was able himself to\r\nfit up many little conveniences in my boat. Besides all this he was able\r\nto help me in my missionary work, as he was a Christian and a communicant\r\nhimself. I think that if a Missionary visits native houses to teach\r\nthe Dyaks, and has as his attendant a “heathen Chinee” or a “scoffing\r\nMohammedan,” it must be a hindrance to his work. Ah Choy left me to work\r\nfor his mother, who was a widow, but even after he had left my service he\r\noften accompanied me on my missionary travels as one of the boatmen, and\r\nI was always very glad to have him with me. He died, while quite a young\r\nman, during an epidemic of cholera.\r\n\r\nWhen my dinner is ready my servant tells me, and I go into the room to\r\neat it. A mat is spread for me, and I sit cross-legged upon it. A few of\r\nthe women of the house sometimes stay in the room while I have my meal,\r\nbut never a crowd, and one is able to have one’s food in comfort.\r\n\r\nAfter the evening meal I come out into the common hall, where the mats\r\nare spread and the people gathered together. The evening is the usual\r\ntime for any discussion, as the men are all back from their outdoor\r\nwork then. I sit down on a mat, and both men and women are seated in a\r\nsemicircle before me, and I try to teach them. Very simple things at\r\nfirst—telling them how God created the world, and made all things good,\r\nand how man of his own wickedness brought sin into the world—very simple\r\nthings of this kind, and these said over and over again, because it takes\r\nthem time to take in new ideas. After two or three evenings spent in this\r\nway I leave the house, but visit it again after an interval of some weeks\r\nor months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LONG DYAK VILLAGE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWhen a house is very long, as in this case, in addition to the ladders at\r\neach end, there are often extra ladders in the middle of the house. One\r\nof these ladders is seen on the right of the picture. The logs of wood on\r\nthe ground are for walking upon.]\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the Dyak there has grown up a crop of rank superstitions\r\nwhich he cannot overcome easily. He has his gods, but his conception\r\nof a God is quite different to that of the Christian. Innumerable\r\nhostile spirits he believes are around him, and these have to be\r\ndealt with, propitiated or outwitted. Though he has many ceremonies\r\nthe Dyak has little religious spirit. The ceremonial rites which he\r\npractises—sacrifices, incantations, observance of omens—are magic charms\r\nto procure material benefits. Hence he has a difficulty in conceiving a\r\nspiritual religion. In the conversations one has in the Dyak house it is\r\nvery usual to be asked such a question as this: “What material advantage\r\nshall I get if I become a Christian? Shall I get better paddy-crops and\r\nbecome rich? Shall I have better health?” Another question which is often\r\nasked the Missionary is: “Must we give up our old customs?” “Yes,” says\r\nthe Missionary, “such of them as are founded upon falsehood or derogatory\r\nto the true God.” Dreams are often discussed, and numerous examples\r\nare brought forward of dreams which have come true. The Missionary\r\nacknowledges that God has spoken in ancient days to men in dreams, but\r\nmaintains that the necessity for doing so no longer exists.\r\n\r\nEndless questions lead to endless explanations, and often the Missionary\r\nfeels at the end of it all that little has been gained. But unpromising\r\nas the soil apparently is, the good seed does germinate. On the next\r\nvisit the Missionary makes to that same house, he will probably find that\r\nsome of his hearers have thought over what he has said, and are willing\r\nto learn more. And after a few visits some of the Dyaks are willing to\r\nput themselves under instruction, and these are taught by the native\r\nCatechist in charge of the district, and also by the Missionary when he\r\npays his visits. When they are sufficiently taught and wish to become\r\nChristians, they are baptized, and if they live good consistent Christian\r\nlives, and have been further instructed, later on they are brought to the\r\nBishop to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nHappily the Gospel message, though profound in truth, is very simple in\r\nform. A plain narration of the life of Jesus Christ always produces a\r\ndeep impression upon the Dyak. It is quite a new revelation to him, the\r\nIncarnation of the Son of God, bringing him totally new thoughts and\r\nideas of God.\r\n\r\nA great help to the work of the Missionary is the example of some man who\r\nhas bravely emancipated himself from the burdensome traditions of his\r\nforefathers, and puts his whole trust in God. There are many such living\r\nin the Saribas district, and they were a great help to the Mission work\r\nthere. That a Dyak can succeed in his labours, or even exist for any\r\nlength of time without the observance of bird omens, or paying heed to\r\ndreams, or continually making sacrifices to gods and spirits, is to Dyaks\r\nin general such a remarkable thing that it rouses their minds to consider\r\nwhat Christianity means. To give up heathen practices, and to pay no heed\r\nto the omens of birds, is but a small part of the Christian religion,\r\nbut it sets men thinking. It is a mark of freedom from the slavery of\r\ntyrannous superstition, and clears the ground for the foundation of a\r\nreal Christian belief and trust in God.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked: “How are services provided for these Dyak Christians\r\nwho live so far away from the Church and the Mission House?” Well, we do\r\nthe best we can for them. By the side of each Dyak house where there are\r\nChristians we build a small prayer-house. It is a very plain and simple\r\nbuilding, and is the same in material and style as their own houses. The\r\nChristian Dyaks build it themselves. They go out into the jungle and get\r\nwhatever is necessary for it. It is an oblong structure, raised a few\r\nfeet off the ground on posts of wood. The walls and the roof are of\r\npalm-leaf thatch, work which the natives can do themselves; the flooring\r\nis of laths of wood fastened down with cane or creepers. And there are\r\nno seats in the building—no forms or chairs—everyone sits on the floor,\r\non which mats are spread. At one end we have a little table, which the\r\nnatives make themselves, and that we use as an altar when we have a\r\ncelebration of the Holy Communion. Altogether it is as primitive a house\r\nof worship as it is possible to imagine, but it is enough for necessary\r\npurposes, and is the best that can be done under the circumstances. The\r\nbuilding does not last long, but is easily rebuilt where there is a will\r\nto do so. To build permanent churches would in most cases be useless\r\nwaste, for the Dyaks are constantly moving their village houses to new\r\nsites.\r\n\r\nThe services held in these little prayer-houses are very reverent. The\r\noffertory at the celebration of Holy Communion is worthy of remark. At\r\nour up-country churches and prayer-houses, we receive in kind as well as\r\nin money. Dyaks very seldom have money, but they have rice, and that is\r\nthe “kind” in which the offertory is made. The rice is brought in little\r\nbaskets or cups, and emptied into a large basket. Sometimes eggs or fruit\r\nare given. The Missionary gives an equivalent in money for the rice,\r\netc., collected, and that money is given to the man who has charge of\r\nthe offertory. This “church-warden” is some Christian living in the Dyak\r\nhouse near.\r\n\r\nThe Missionary has a very large district in his charge, and travelling\r\nis so difficult that he cannot very often visit the different houses\r\nwhere there are Christians; and the native teacher has also a large\r\nground to cover, and cannot very often hold services at the different\r\nprayer-houses. So if we can find some man in the house who is a\r\ngood Christian, and has been to school and can read, we ask him, in\r\nthe absence of the Missionary and of the native teacher, to conduct\r\nservices. On the Sunday morning in many Dyak houses, when neither the\r\nMissionary nor the native teacher is there, one of themselves—some young\r\nman—will collect the Christians together, and they will go to the little\r\nprayer-house, and he will read the prayers, and they will offer up\r\ntheir petitions and thanksgivings to God. In many Dyak houses, however,\r\nthough there are Christians, there is no one whom we can ask to read\r\nthe prayers. They have to go without their services, sometimes for long\r\nintervals, until such time as the native teacher or the Missionary can\r\nvisit them.\r\n\r\nVisiting the houses where there are Christians, and holding services in\r\nthe little prayer-houses built by themselves, is pleasant and interesting\r\nwork. The Dyaks are told beforehand when the Missionary is coming, and\r\nthey look forward to his visit, and as many as are able leave their\r\nfarm-huts where they may be staying so as to be at the house to welcome\r\nhim. The Dyaks are civil, natural in manner, kindly disposed, and\r\ncheerful. They are also very intelligent, and I have had many interesting\r\nconversations on my Missionary visits. Questions are often asked by the\r\nDyaks showing that they have thought over something that has been said\r\non a former visit; and in the Saribas district, where so many Dyaks had\r\nlearnt to read, it was no unusual thing to be asked to explain some\r\nparticular passage in the Gospels, the Dyak translation of which many of\r\nthem had.\r\n\r\nTravelling by river is safe enough except where there are sandbanks,\r\nand there a little extra care is necessary. But during the north-east\r\nmonsoon—October to March—the sea is generally very rough, and travelling\r\nby sea in the kind of boat the Missionary uses is sometimes dangerous. He\r\nhas to use a boat that draws very little water, because of the sand banks\r\nin the rivers, and such a boat is not suitable for the sea. I am thankful\r\nto say that during all the years I was in Borneo my boat was only swamped\r\nonce. We have had many narrow escapes—the boat full of water over and\r\nover again, and two men baling out the water as fast as possible while\r\nthe others were rowing. The boat I used in my travels was made of light\r\nwood, and the only part of it that was made of harder wood was the keel.\r\nEven if it were full of water, it would still float, and we could often\r\nrow through the waves without anything worse than a thorough wetting.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion when my boat was swamped I was returning from the\r\ncapital, Kuching, where I had been Acting-Chaplain for some months, to\r\nmy up-country station at Temudok on the Krian River. It was during the\r\nnorth-east monsoon, and the sea was very rough. After leaving the Kuching\r\nRiver we put in at Sampun, a little stream near. There we stayed seven\r\ndays. Early every morning we put out to sea, but it was impossible to row\r\nthrough the waves, and we had to put back. Then we ran short of food; we\r\nhad no rice for the men. At the next flood-tide I told my boatmen to row\r\nup the Sampun stream, as I felt certain I should be able to buy rice from\r\nsome people living there. After two hours’ rowing we came to the hut of a\r\nChinaman. He said he had only three _gantangs_ of rice. (A _gantang_ is a\r\ndry measure, and equal to about three-quarters of a peck.) I asked him\r\nto sell me all the rice he had. He was quite willing to do so, and said\r\nthat if I would wait a day, he would have some paddy pounded, and be able\r\nto supply me with more rice. I said what he had would be sufficient, and\r\nI told my boatmen that whatever the weather was next day, we must put out\r\nto sea.\r\n\r\nVery early next morning we started. The sea was very rough, and to\r\nescape the breakers we went farther and farther away from land. I had my\r\nexcellent servant, Ah Choy, with me, and he was steering, and I had a\r\nvery good crew of Dyak boatmen. After some time Ah Choy said to me:\r\n\r\n“We are very far out, and can hardly see the land. Had we not better get\r\nnearer shore?”\r\n\r\nThe men were rowing as well as they could, but they were getting very\r\ntired, and we were making very little progress.\r\n\r\nI told Ah Choy to bring the boat nearer shore, but as soon as we got into\r\nshallower water the waves were so great that it was evident the boat\r\ncould not live through them.\r\n\r\nI asked Ah Choy to steer the boat straight for the shore, and I told the\r\nmen to row as hard as they could, and as soon as they felt their oars\r\ntouch bottom to jump out and pull the boat up the shore as fast as they\r\ncould. They did exactly as I wished. The boat was dragged ashore, but\r\nseveral large waves beat into it, and everything was soaked. It had one\r\nor two hard bumps on the sand, and was split from end to end.\r\n\r\nWe were not far from Kabong, a village at the mouth of the Krian River,\r\nand I, accompanied by one of my boatmen, walked along the beach to\r\nthe Government Fort there. The clerk in charge, Ah Fook Cheyne, kindly\r\nsupplied me with food and with sleeping things for the night. I sent some\r\nMalays to look after my boat, which they managed to bring to Kabong the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have had to travel on foot I have always had with me Dyaks who\r\nknew the country, so there has been no danger of my losing my way. But it\r\nis remarkable how easily one can get lost in the jungle. I have sometimes\r\ngone off the path for no great distance, and have had some difficulty in\r\nfinding my way back. At Banting one afternoon I was accompanied by two\r\nschoolboys, and we went into the lowland jungle near the Mission Hill\r\nafter some wood-pigeon. We followed the birds from one wild fig-tree to\r\nanother, and managed to shoot a few, and then we tried to find our way\r\nback. After wandering about for some twenty minutes we came to a spot\r\nwhere a tree had been cut down, and a length of the trunk used evidently\r\nfor a Dyak coffin. As someone had been buried a few days ago in the\r\ncemetery round the church, we guessed we could not be far from Banting\r\nHill, on which the Mission House and Church stood. We tried to follow\r\nwhat we thought was the track made by the people who had cut the tree\r\ndown, but after wandering about for over half an hour, we found ourselves\r\nin the same spot again.\r\n\r\nWe could see the sun through the trees, and one of the boys with me said:\r\n\r\n“When we sit on the seat on the brow of the hill facing the river we see\r\nthe sun setting in front of us, so if we walk in the direction of the sun\r\nwe are sure to come to some part of Banting Hill.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed a sensible suggestion. We had been walking in the opposite\r\ndirection. We turned round and walked back, and sure enough we got to the\r\nfruit-trees on Banting Hill, and had no difficulty in finding our way to\r\nthe Mission House.\r\n\r\nOne day when I was at Sebetan I left the path which ran along the side of\r\nthe river. I had with me three Dyak schoolboys, and we wandered about and\r\ncould not find our way out of the jungle. One of the boys said, when we\r\ncame to a small jungle-stream:\r\n\r\n“If we follow this stream it will lead us to the river.”\r\n\r\nWe did so, and soon found the path by the river.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that on both these occasions I was with Dyak boys who\r\nhelped me to find my way. I have noticed that older Dyaks seem to have a\r\ngood idea of locality, and generally know in what direction the path they\r\nhave left lies.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not an unknown thing for Dyaks to be lost in the jungle.\r\nA Dyak friend of mine in Sebetan told me that on one occasion he had been\r\nin the jungle all day collecting canes, and in the evening when he wanted\r\nto return he could not find his way out. He climbed up a tree in the\r\nhope of seeing the smoke of some Dyak house or farm hut, but saw no such\r\nthing. As it was growing dark, and there was no likelihood of his finding\r\nhis way till next morning, he prepared to spend the night where he was.\r\nHe climbed up a tree, and made himself as comfortable as possible among\r\nthe branches, took off his waist-cloth, and tied himself to the tree,\r\nthat he might not slip off when asleep, and spent an uncomfortable night\r\nup there. Next morning he had no difficulty in finding his way back to\r\nhis house.\r\n\r\nThe wonder to me is that Dyaks so seldom get lost in the jungle. When\r\nthey are hunting wild pig they must often wander far from the path, and\r\nyet somehow they manage to find their way out of the jungle without any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nDYAK FOLKLORE\r\n\r\n    Sea Dyak stories—_Ensera_—_Kana_—The mouse-deer and the\r\n    tortoise—Klieng—Kumang—Apai Saloi—The cunning of the\r\n    mouse-deer—The mouse-deer and other animals who went out\r\n    fishing—The mouse-deer, the deer, and the pig—Sea Dyak proverbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks possess many stories, legends, and fables handed down by\r\ntradition from ancient times. All these have been transmitted by word\r\nof mouth from generation to generation, as the Dyaks have no written\r\nlanguage of their own. These tales may be roughly divided in two\r\nclasses—those that are plainly told, and called _ensera_; and those that\r\nare set in a peculiar rhythmical measure, and sung to a monotonous chant,\r\nand called _kana_.\r\n\r\nAmong the former are a large number of stories corresponding to the\r\nadventures of Brer Rabbit, or our own tales illustrating the cunning\r\nof the fox. In the Dyak stories the mouse-deer and the tortoise—two of\r\nthe smallest animals they know—are generally represented either acting\r\nin concert or individually, and their cunning is always more than a\r\nmatch against the strength of all other animals. The Dyaks also have\r\nmany legends which give an account of the origin and reason for some of\r\ntheir religious beliefs and customs. These are no doubt purely Dyak, but\r\nthe many tales related nowadays about Rajahs and their adventures are\r\nprobably derived from Malay sources in more recent times.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of the mythical heroes of the Dyaks are also related. The\r\ngreatest hero is Klieng, who is not a god, but supposed to belong to\r\nthis world of ours. He is not now visible to human eyes, but his help is\r\noften invoked in times of war, and offerings of food are often made to\r\nhim. Tradition says that he had no father or mother, but was found in the\r\nknot of a tree by Ngelai, who brought him up as his brother. As he grew\r\nup, he developed a restless spirit, and would not apply himself to the\r\nregular Dyak pursuits. He was wayward and capricious, and would disappear\r\nfor long periods, often being given up for dead by his sorrowing friends.\r\nThen he would suddenly reappear in his own home, to the surprise and\r\njoy of his friends. He is represented as handsome and brave, and always\r\nsuccessful in expeditions against his enemies. He had a wonderful power\r\nof metamorphosis, and, when necessary, could transform himself into an\r\nanimal or anything else. On one occasion he is said to have changed\r\nhimself into the fragment of a broken water-gourd, and was carried by\r\nNgelai in his basket to the battle. The enemy were too powerful for them,\r\nand Ngelai and his friends were being defeated, when the basket was\r\nplaced on the ground, and Klieng revealed himself in his true character\r\nof a great warrior, and in a very short time routed the enemy.\r\n\r\nKlieng married Kumang, the Dyak Venus. Many stories concerning them are\r\nset to native song. These _kana_ are sometimes sung by some Dyak singer,\r\nwho lies on a mat or sits on a swing in the dim light of the covered\r\nveranda of the long Dyak house. His audience sit or lie around and listen\r\nto him, very often till the small hours of the morning. The incidents\r\nin a story thus sung are not many, but the Dyaks delight in verbosity\r\nand amplification, and use a dozen similes where one would do, and love\r\nto repeat over and over again the description of the various characters\r\nin different words, with the double object of showing their command of\r\nlanguage and to lengthen the story.\r\n\r\nThey have many amusing tales told of Apai Saloi (the father of Saloi)—the\r\nSimple Simon of the Dyaks. He is represented as doing the most foolish\r\nthings, and always outwitted by his enemy, Apai Samumang (the father of\r\nSamumang), who does not hesitate to take advantage of his stupidity.\r\nThe following will give an idea of the kind of story related of Apai\r\nSaloi:—One day he was paddling in his boat in the river, and his axe-head\r\nfell into the water. He made a notch in the side of the boat to mark\r\nthe spot where the axe-head dropped into the water, and paddled home.\r\n“There will be plenty of time,” he said, “for me to look for it to-morrow\r\nmorning.” He reached the landing-stage of his house, and pulled his boat\r\nup the bank. The next day he went to the boat and looked for his lost\r\naxe-head underneath the part of the boat where he saw the notch he had\r\nmade the day before. He was very much surprised at not finding his lost\r\naxe-head!\r\n\r\nBut what seems to give the Dyaks most pleasure are tales about animals,\r\nespecially those in which the cunning of the mouse-deer (_akal plandok_)\r\nis displayed. The following are well known among them, and I have myself\r\noften heard these related, with variations, by the Dyaks themselves. Very\r\noften, in travelling by boat in Borneo, one has to wait for the turn of\r\nthe tide, and the Dyak boatmen on these occasions often relate some of\r\ntheir old stories to each other to while away the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE MOUSE-DEER AND OTHER ANIMALS WHO WENT OUT FISHING.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the Mouse-Deer, accompanied by many other animals, went\r\non a fishing expedition. All day long they fished, and in the evening\r\nreturned to the little hut that they had put up by the river-side, salted\r\nthe fish that they had caught, and stored it up in their jars. They\r\nnoticed that somehow or other their fish disappeared day by day, and\r\nthe animals held a council to decide what it was best to do. After some\r\ndiscussion the Deer said he would stay behind while the others went out\r\nto fish, so that he might catch the thief.\r\n\r\n“I shall be able to master him, whoever he is,” said the Deer. “If he\r\nrefuses to do what I wish, I shall soon punish him with my sharp horns.”\r\n\r\nSo the others went out fishing, leaving the Deer at home. Soon he heard\r\nthe tramp of someone coming to the foot of the steps leading up into the\r\nhut, calling out:\r\n\r\n“Is anyone at home?”\r\n\r\n“I am here,” said the Deer. Looking out, he saw a great Giant, and his\r\nheart failed him. He wished he had asked one of his companions to stay at\r\nhome with him.\r\n\r\n“I smell some fish,” said the Giant. “I want some, and I must have it. I\r\nam hungry. Let me have what I want.”\r\n\r\n“It does not belong to me,” said the Deer in great fear. “It belongs to\r\nthe Pig, the Bear, the Tiger, and the Mouse-Deer. They would punish me\r\nseverely if I gave any of it to you.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk to me in that way. If you do not let me have what I want, I\r\nwill eat you up,” said the Giant.\r\n\r\nThe Deer was too much awed by his visitor to attack the Giant, so he let\r\nhim eat the fish and take some away with him.\r\n\r\nWhen his companions returned, the Deer gave them his account of the\r\nGiant’s visit. They blamed him for his cowardice, and the Wild Boar said\r\nhe would keep watch the next day.\r\n\r\n“If the Giant comes,” said he, “I will gore him with my tusks and trample\r\nhim underfoot.”\r\n\r\nBut he fared no better than the Deer, for when he saw the Giant, who\r\nthreatened to kill him if he refused to give him some fish, he was\r\nafraid, and let him take as much as he wanted.\r\n\r\nGreat was the disgust of the others to find on their return that their\r\nfish had again been stolen.\r\n\r\n“Let me watch,” said the Bear. “No Giant shall frighten me. I will hug\r\nhim in my arms and scratch him with my sharp claws.”\r\n\r\nSo Bruin was left in charge the next day, while the others went out to\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nSoon he heard the Giant, who came to the foot of the steps and shouted:\r\n“Hullo! who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said the Bear. “Who are you, and what do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I can smell some nice fish, and I am hungry, and want some.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot let you have any,” said the Bear. “It does not belong to me.”\r\n\r\n“Let me have some at once,” said the Giant in a voice of thunder, “before\r\nI kill and eat you.”\r\n\r\nThe Bear was too much frightened to interfere while the Giant ransacked\r\nthe jars. When he had had enough, he bade the Bear “Good-bye” and went\r\noff.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the other animals, the Tiger said he would put a stop to\r\nthis state of things. He would stay at home the next day and keep watch.\r\nIt would have to be a very strong Giant indeed that would dare to fight\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe Giant paid his visit as before, and when he found the Tiger at home,\r\nhe said that he was hungry, and asked for some fish. At first the Tiger\r\nrefused to give any to him, but when he saw his formidable enemy he was\r\nafraid, and let him have as much as he wanted.\r\n\r\nOn their return again the animals found their fish had been stolen.\r\n\r\nThen the Mouse-Deer spoke. “I see,” he said, “that it is no use depending\r\non you others. You boast, but when the time comes for action, you have no\r\ncourage. I will stay at home and secure this Giant that you speak of.”\r\n\r\nWhen his companions had gone away the next morning, the Mouse-Deer put a\r\nbandage round his forehead and lay down.\r\n\r\nSoon came the Giant, and shouted: “Who’s there?”\r\n\r\n“Only me,” said the Mouse-Deer, groaning with pain. “Come up, whoever you\r\nmay be.”\r\n\r\nThe Giant climbed up the rickety steps, and saw the Mouse-Deer lying with\r\nhis head bandaged.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with you?” asked the Giant.\r\n\r\n“I have a headache,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Whatever has given you the headache?” asked the Giant.\r\n\r\n“Can’t you guess?” said the Mouse-Deer. “It is the smell of this fish in\r\nthese jars. It is so strong it is enough to make anyone ill. Don’t you\r\nfeel ill yourself?”\r\n\r\n“I think I do,” said the Giant. “Cannot you give me some medicine?”\r\n\r\n“I have no medicine with me,” said the Mouse-Deer, “but I can bandage\r\nyou, as I have done myself, and it is sure to do you good.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said the Giant. “It is good of you to take the trouble to\r\ncure me.”\r\n\r\nSo the Giant lay down as he was bid, while the Mouse-Deer bandaged his\r\nhead, and fastened the ends of the bandage to pegs which he drove in the\r\nground under the open flooring of the hut.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you feel a little pain in your ankles?” anxiously suggested the\r\nMouse-Deer.\r\n\r\n“I think I do,” said the foolish Giant. “Suppose you bandage them, too.”\r\n\r\nSo the Mouse-Deer, chuckling to himself, bandaged his ankles, and made\r\nthem fast to the floor of the hut.\r\n\r\n“Do you not feel the pain in your legs?” asked the Mouse-Deer.\r\n\r\n“I think I do,” was the foolish Giant’s reply.\r\n\r\nSo the Mouse-Deer bandaged his legs and made them secure, so that the\r\nGiant was quite unable to move.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Giant began to feel uneasy, and trying to get up, and\r\nfinding himself securely bound, he struggled and roared in pain and anger.\r\n\r\nThe little Mouse-Deer sat before him and laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n“You were a match for the Deer, the Pig, the Bear, and the Tiger, but\r\nyou are defeated by me. Don’t make so much noise, or I shall drive a peg\r\nthrough your temples and kill you.”\r\n\r\nJust then the others returned from their fishing. Great was their joy to\r\nfind their enemy securely bound. With cries of triumph they fell upon the\r\nGiant and killed him, and praised the Mouse-Deer for his cleverness in\r\nsecuring him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE MOUSE-DEER, THE DEER AND THE PIG.\r\n\r\nA Mouse-Deer wandering in the jungle fell into a pit. He could not get\r\nout, so he waited patiently for some passer-by. Presently a Pig passed by\r\nthe mouth of the pit. The Mouse-Deer called out to him, and he looked in\r\nand asked the Mouse-Deer what he was doing there.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know what is going to happen? The sky is going to fall down,\r\nand everybody will be crushed to dust unless he takes shelter in a pit.\r\nIf you want to save your life you had better jump in.”\r\n\r\nThe Pig jumped into the pit, and the Mouse-Deer got on his back, but he\r\nfound he was not high enough to enable him to leap out.\r\n\r\nNext a Deer came along, and, seeing the two animals in the pit, asked\r\nthem what they were doing there.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse-Deer replied: “The sky is going to fall, and everyone will be\r\ncrushed unless he hides in some hole. Jump in if you want to save your\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThe Deer sprang in, and the Mouse-Deer made him stand on the back of the\r\nPig; then he himself got on the back of the Deer and jumped out of the\r\npit, leaving the other two to their fate.\r\n\r\nThe Deer and the Pig were very angry at being tricked in this way by\r\nsuch a small animal as the Mouse-Deer. They scratched the side of the\r\npit until it sloped, and enabled them to get out; then they followed the\r\ntrail of the Mouse-Deer, and soon overtook him.\r\n\r\nThe Mouse-Deer saw them coming, and climbed up a tree, from the boughs of\r\nwhich a large beehive was hanging.\r\n\r\n“Come down,” said the Pig and Deer angrily. “You have deceived us, and we\r\nmean to kill you.”\r\n\r\n“Deceived you?” said the Mouse-Deer. “When did I deceive you, or do\r\nanything to deserve death?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t you tell us that the sky was going to fall, and that if we did\r\nnot hide ourselves in a pit we should be killed?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” was the reply. “What I said was perfectly true, only I\r\npersuaded the King to postpone the disaster.”\r\n\r\n“You need not try to put us off with any more lies. You must come down,\r\nfor we mean to have your blood.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot,” said the Mouse-Deer, “because the King has asked me to watch\r\nhis gong,” pointing to the bee’s-nest.\r\n\r\n“Is that the King’s gong?” said the Deer. “I should like to strike it to\r\nhear what it sounds like.”\r\n\r\n“So you may,” said the Mouse-Deer, “only let me get down and go to some\r\ndistance before you do so, as the noise would deafen me.”\r\n\r\nSo the Mouse-Deer sprang down and ran away. The Deer took a long stick\r\nand struck the bee’s-nest, and the bees flew out angrily and stung him to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe Pig, seeing what had happened, pursued the Mouse-Deer, determined to\r\navenge the death of his friend. He found his enemy taking refuge on a\r\ntree round the trunk of which was a large python curled.\r\n\r\n“Come down,” said the Pig, “and I will kill you.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot come down to-day. I am set here to watch the King’s girdle.\r\nLook at it,” he said, pointing to the Python. “Is it not pretty? I have\r\nnever seen such a handsome waist-belt before.”\r\n\r\n“It is beautiful,” said the Pig. “How I should like to wear it for one\r\nday!”\r\n\r\n“So you may,” said the Mouse-Deer, “but be careful, and do not spoil it.”\r\n\r\nSo the foolish Pig entangled himself in the folds of the Python, who\r\nsoon crushed him to death and ate him for his dinner, and the clever\r\nMouse-Deer escaped, having outwitted his enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA DYAK PROVERBS.\r\n\r\nKing Solomon, we are told, “spake three thousand proverbs,” and many of\r\nthese, as well as proverbs of an older date, have been handed down to us\r\nin a more or less authentic form. A translation of them into English is\r\nto be found in a well-known book. King Solomon was perhaps the first to\r\nmake a collection of proverbs, but long before his time proverbs were\r\nin common use. It would seem that in every age and in every clime the\r\nexistence of language is accompanied by the existence of proverbs.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyaks have their proverbs, and these remind us of the lines:—\r\n\r\n    “Turn, turn thy wheel! The human race,\r\n       Of every tongue, of every place,\r\n     Caucasian, Coptic, or Malay,\r\n       All that inhabit this great earth,\r\n     Whatever be their rank or worth,\r\n       Are kindred and allied by birth,\r\n     And made of the same clay.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to imagine two nationalities so far removed from each\r\nother in every respect as the English and the Dyak, and yet, when we\r\ncome to consider their proverbs, we find that they join hands and stand\r\non common ground. Allowing for difference in environment, and consequent\r\ndifference of similes, the ideas expressed in many Dyak proverbs is\r\nprecisely similar to that of some well known among the English.\r\n\r\nThe three following examples, taken from among many others, which are\r\noften used by the Dyaks of the present day, will illustrate what I mean:—\r\n\r\n_Remaung di rumah, rawong di tanah_ (“A tiger in the house, [but] a frog\r\nin the field”). A lion in council, but a lamb in action.\r\n\r\n_Kasih ka imbok, enda kasih ka manok_ (“To show kindness to the wild\r\npigeon, [but] not to show kindness to the domestic fowl”). Charity begins\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n_Lari ka ribut nemu ujan, lari ka sungkup nemu pendam_ (“Running from the\r\nhurricane, he encounters the rain; running from a tombstone, he finds\r\nhimself in a graveyard”). Out of the frying-pan into the fire.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, a great deal in human life changes as the years roll on.\r\nScience grows, knowledge increases, society makes its way to new forms of\r\norganization, and the outward fashions of life pass away, and new ones\r\ntake their place. All this is obvious and inevitable. And so there must\r\nof necessity be many points of difference between primitive races and\r\nraces high up in the scale of civilization. Yet in human life there are\r\ncertain things which are always the same. Underneath what is variable in\r\nman there is that which never changes. Now and again we catch glimpses\r\nof this as we read some ancient author, and find that across the gap of\r\nages lived one who, thousands of years ago, in some respects, at least,\r\nthought as we think and felt as we feel. The radical fundamental thoughts\r\nand passions of mankind all over the world, in every age, are much\r\nthe same; and so, after consideration, it ought not to be a matter of\r\nsurprise to find that some of the Sea Dyak proverbs convey precisely the\r\nsame ideas as the proverbs of the English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHREE DYAK LEGENDS\r\n\r\n    Dyak fairy-tales and legends—I. DANJAI AND THE WERE-TIGER’S\r\n    SISTER—II. THE STORY OF SIU, who first taught the Dyaks to\r\n    observe the omens of birds—III. PULANG GANA, and how he came to\r\n    be worshipped as the god of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many fairy-tales and legends known to the Sea Dyaks of the\r\npresent day. As they have no written language, these have been handed\r\ndown by word of mouth from generation to generation from ancient times.\r\nThese tales and legends may be divided into two classes:—\r\n\r\n1. Those purely fabulous, and related as such, which are simply meant\r\nto interest and amuse, and in these respects resemble the fairy-tales\r\nfamiliar to us all.\r\n\r\n2. And those believed to be perfectly true, and to record events which\r\nhave actually taken place, which are the traditions respecting their\r\ngods and preternatural beings. These form, in fact, the mythology of the\r\nDyaks. To this latter class belong the many and varied adventures of\r\n_Klieng_, the great warrior hero of ancient times, and his wife _Kumang_,\r\nthe Dyak Venus, as well as the traditions relating to the gods believed\r\nin by the Dyaks of the present day. To these must be added certain\r\nstories which give a reason for some of the curious customs observed by\r\nthe Dyaks. The three myths which follow belong to this latter class. The\r\nDyak legends are fast being forgotten, and I had the greatest difficulty\r\nin obtaining the few here preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DANJAI AND THE WERE-TIGER’S SISTER.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived a great Chief named Danjai. He was the head\r\nof one of the longest Dyak houses that were ever built. It was situated\r\non a hill in the midst of a large plantation of fruit trees. Danjai was\r\nsaid to be very rich indeed. He possessed much farming land, many fruit\r\ntrees, many _tapang_ trees, where the wild bees made their abode, and\r\nfrom which the sweet honey is obtained, and in his room there were many\r\nvaluable jars of various kinds, and also a large number of brass vessels;\r\nfor the Dyaks convert their wealth into jars and brassware to hand down\r\nto posterity. Every year he obtained a plentiful harvest of paddy,[2]\r\nmuch more than he and his family could consume, and he had always much\r\npaddy for sale, so much so that the news of his wealth travelled to\r\ndistant lands, and many from afar off would come and buy paddy from him.\r\nDanjai also possessed many slaves, who were ready to help him in his work.\r\n\r\nAll the people in his house had a very high opinion of his judgment,\r\nand were ready to obey his decisions, whenever he settled any of their\r\ndisputes. So great indeed was his reputation for wisdom that men from\r\ndistant villages would often consult him and ask his advice when in\r\nany difficulty. He had also great fame as a brave warrior, and during\r\nexpeditions against the enemy, he was the leader of the men of his own\r\nvillage and of many villages around, for all liked to follow such a brave\r\nman as Danjai, who was sure to lead them to victory. Over the fireplace\r\nin his veranda he had, hanging together in a bunch, the dried heads of\r\nthe enemies whom he himself had killed.\r\n\r\nNow this man Danjai had a very pretty wife whom he had recently married,\r\nbut the marriage feast had not been held, because he had not yet obtained\r\na human head from the enemy as a token of his love for her: for this girl\r\nwas of good birth and a Chief’s daughter, and wanted the whole world to\r\nknow, when they attended her marriage feast, what a brave man her husband\r\nwas. One day Danjai said to his young wife: “I will hold a meeting of the\r\nChiefs around, and tell them that we must all get our war-boats ready, as\r\nI intend leading an expedition against the enemy. I should like to bring\r\nyou a human head as a token of my love, so that you may not be ashamed of\r\nyour husband. And as soon as I return, we will have the wedding feast.”\r\nThough his wife was sorry that her husband intended leaving her, still\r\nshe did not oppose his wishes, for she wished him to come back covered\r\nwith glory. So a council of war was held, and Danjai told the assembled\r\nChiefs what he intended to do, and it was decided that all should begin\r\nat once making war-boats, which were to be ready in two months’ time.\r\n\r\nAssisted by his slaves and followers, Danjai had been at work at his boat\r\nfor several weeks, and it was nearly finished. It was a beautiful boat\r\nmade out of the trunk of one large tree, and Danjai was proud of his\r\nwork. He was so anxious to finish his boat that one day he started very\r\nearly in the morning, before his breakfast was ready, and he asked his\r\nwife to bring his food to him later on to the part of the jungle where he\r\nwas working at his boat.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Mrs. Danjai cooked the food and ate her own breakfast. Then\r\nshe made up a small bundle of rice and also put together some fish and\r\nsalt, and placed all in a little basket to take to her husband. She had\r\nnever been out in the jungle by herself before, but she was not afraid,\r\nfor her husband had told her the way, and she could hear the sound of his\r\nadze as he worked at his boat not very far off. She hung her basket over\r\nher left shoulder, and, holding her small knife in her right hand, went\r\ncheerfully on. Presently she came to the stump of a tree on which was\r\nplaced a bunch of ripe _sibau_ fruit. They looked so tempting that she\r\ncould not help eating some of them, and as they were very nice, she put\r\nwhat remained in her basket, saying to herself: “Perhaps Danjai forgot to\r\ntake these with him and left them here. I will take them to him myself;\r\nhe will no doubt be glad to eat these ripe fruits after his hard work.”\r\n\r\nNow there was in this land a Were-Tiger, that was much feared by all\r\nwho lived around. He had the appearance of a man, but at times would\r\ntransform himself into a tiger, and then he would attack human beings\r\nand carry off their heads as trophies to his own house. But he never\r\nattacked any unless they had first done wrong by taking something which\r\nbelonged to him. So this Were-Tiger would leave tempting fruit by the\r\nside of jungle paths, and on the stumps of trees, in the hope that some\r\ntired traveller would take and eat them. And if anyone ate such fruit,\r\nthen he or she was doomed to be killed by him that same day. But all knew\r\nabout him, and though he placed many tempting baits in all parts of the\r\njungle, no one touched his fruit, for all feared the fate which awaited\r\nthem if they did any such things. But Danjai’s wife knew nothing about\r\nthe Were-Tiger. No one had told her of him, and she had never been out\r\nbefore in the jungle by herself, and she had never been warned not to\r\ntouch any fruit she might find lying about.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danjai,” she said, as soon as she met her husband, “I am afraid I am\r\nrather late. You must be very tired and hungry, working the whole morning\r\nat your boat without having had anything to eat. Never mind! Here is your\r\nbreakfast at last.” And she handed the basket which contained his food to\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nNow Danjai was really very hungry, so he was glad to see his food had\r\narrived. He thanked his wife, and at once began to empty the basket.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he saw was the ripe _sibau_ fruit at the top, and he\r\nasked his wife where she got them from. She told him she had found them\r\non the stump of a tree by the wayside, and she said she thought they had\r\nbeen left there by him. She added with a smile that they were very good,\r\nas she had eaten some herself.\r\n\r\nThen Danjai, brave man though he was, turned pale with fear and anxiety.\r\n\r\n“We must not linger here a moment,” he said to his wife. “Hungry though\r\nI am, I will not eat my food here. We must both hurry home at once. You\r\nhave taken and eaten fruit belonging to the Were-Tiger, so much feared by\r\nall. It is said that whoever touches his fruit will surely die a terrible\r\ndeath: and you are the first person I know who has done so.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK WOMAN IN EVERYDAY COSTUME\r\n\r\nShe is wearing a necklace of small silver current coins, fastened\r\ntogether with silver links. The bangles are hollow, and of silver or\r\nbrass, made separately, but worn several together on each wrist. The two\r\nfavourite colours for petticoats are blue and red. The red petticoat, as\r\nin the picture, has often a design in white worked or woven into it.]\r\n\r\nDanjai hurriedly gathered together all his tools and told those that were\r\nwith him of his trouble, and they all started and walked silently back.\r\nDanjai was wondering how he was to avert the fate which awaited his young\r\nwife. She was silent, because she saw her husband was troubled, and she\r\nwas sorry that she had caused him grief.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they arrived at the house, Danjai sent for all the men round\r\nabout and told them what had happened, how his wife had taken and eaten\r\nthe fruit of the Were-Tiger. He begged them all to help to shield her,\r\nfor the Were-Tiger was sure to have his revenge, and come and take the\r\nhead of his wife.\r\n\r\nSo they all prepared themselves for the tiger’s visit by sharpening\r\ntheir knives and spears. Some men placed themselves on the roof of the\r\nhouse, others in the veranda. The ladder leading up to the house was also\r\nguarded, and so were all parts of the house by which he was likely to\r\nforce an entrance. As for Danjai’s wife, they hid her beneath some mats\r\nand sheets in the room, and twelve brave men stood round her with their\r\nswords drawn, ready to save her life even at the cost of their own.\r\n\r\nJust before dark they heard the roar of the tiger in the distance. Though\r\nstill a long way off, the sound was very terrible to hear, and the men\r\nall grasped their swords and spears firmly, for they knew the tiger would\r\nsoon be upon them.\r\n\r\nOnce more the tiger’s roar sounded, nearer and clearer, and then they\r\nheard him crash through the leaf-thatch roof and fall into the room.\r\nThere was a great commotion among the men, but though all tried to kill\r\nthe animal, none could see him. Soon after they heard a roar of triumph\r\nfrom the tiger outside the house. They lifted up the mats and sheets\r\nwhich covered Danjai’s wife, and there they saw her headless body! The\r\nWere-Tiger had succeeded in his attack, and had carried off the head of\r\nhis victim!\r\n\r\nLoud was the weeping and great the lamentation over her dead body. She\r\nwas so young to die! And what death could be more terrible than hers\r\nwhose head had been carried away by her murderer! All in the house\r\nmourned her loss for seven days, and during that time the house was very\r\nquiet, as all lived in their separate rooms, and did not come out into\r\nthe common veranda to do work or to talk to each other.\r\n\r\nThe death of his wife grieved Danjai very much. But though his grief was\r\ngreat, his desire for revenge was greater still.\r\n\r\nVery early on the morning of the next day Danjai started after the tiger.\r\nThe drops of blood which had fallen could plainly be seen on the ground,\r\nand he had no difficulty in finding out in what direction the tiger had\r\ngone. On and on he tracked the blood till he came to a cave at the foot\r\nof a high mountain. The sides of the cave were splashed with blood, so\r\nDanjai walked boldly in, determined to revenge the death of his wife. It\r\nwas not very dark in the cave. In the distance he could see an opening,\r\nand he hurried towards it.\r\n\r\nHe came out on the other side of the mountain, and saw a large plantation\r\nof sugar-cane and plantain-trees. Beyond this he saw a long Dyak house.\r\n\r\n“This,” he said to himself, “is surely the abode of the Were-Tiger, and\r\nsoon I shall have an opportunity of revenging the death of my wife.”\r\n\r\nHe planted two sticks one across the other in the ground to mark the\r\nopening in the mountain, so that he might not miss his way on his return,\r\nand then he boldly walked towards the house.\r\n\r\nHe followed a path through the sugar-cane plantation—still tracking the\r\ndrops of blood upon the ground—until he came to the ladder leading up to\r\nthe house. He was so anxious to attack his wife’s murderer that he did\r\nnot pause to ask—as is the usual Dyak custom—whether he might walk up\r\nor not, but went straight on into the house. Men sitting in the veranda\r\nasked him, as he passed them, where he was going and what he wanted, but\r\nhe did not answer them. His heart was heavy within him, thinking of his\r\ndead wife, and wondering if he would be able to accomplish his task,\r\nand whether he would succeed in leaving the house as easily as he came\r\nin. But he was determined to avenge his wife’s murder, and he would not\r\nshrink from any difficulties in the way.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the room of the headman of the house, and a girl asked him\r\nto sit down, and spread a mat for him. He did so, and the girl went into\r\nthe room to fetch the brass vessel containing the betel-nut ingredients\r\nwhich the Dyaks love to chew. As he sat down, he saw drops of blood on\r\nthe fireplace, and, looking up, he noticed a fresh head, still dripping\r\nwith blood, among the other skulls hanging there. He recognized it at a\r\nglance—it was the head of his loved wife!\r\n\r\nThe girl came out with the brass vessel of betel-nut, and said: “Help\r\nyourself, Danjai. We did not expect you to visit us so soon. Please\r\nexcuse me for a while; I have to attend to the cooking. But you will\r\nnot be alone, for my brother will soon be back. He has only gone to the\r\nplantation to fetch some sugar-cane.”\r\n\r\nSo Danjai sat on the mat by himself, thinking what he was to do next,\r\nand what he was to say to his wife’s murderer when he came in. Soon the\r\nWere-Tiger arrived, carrying on his shoulder a bundle of sugar-cane.\r\n\r\n“I am very pleased to see you, Danjai,” he said. “Would you like some\r\nsugar-cane? If so, help yourself.”\r\n\r\nDanjai was so sad thinking of his wife that he did not notice how curious\r\nit was that they should know his name when they had never seen him\r\nbefore. He did not feel at all inclined to eat sugar-cane, but lest his\r\nhost should think he had come to kill, and to put him off his guard, he\r\npretended to eat a little. He heard the Were-Tiger say to his sister in\r\nthe room that she was to be sure to have enough food cooked, as Danjai\r\nwould eat with them that evening. Then he left them and went to the river\r\nto bathe.\r\n\r\nThe sister came out of the room, and spoke to Danjai, who was still\r\nsitting in the veranda, and asked him to come into the room, as she had\r\nsomething to say to him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Danjai,” she said to him in a kind tone of voice, “I know of your\r\ntrouble and I am sorry for you. However, if you follow my advice, all\r\nwill be well. You must be careful, for my brother is easily put out, and\r\nhas no scruples about killing any who displease him. Our own people here\r\nhate him, for he is so merciless; but no one dares attack him, for all\r\nfear him greatly. Now listen attentively to what I have to say. When I\r\nput out the plates of rice in the room presently, do not take the one\r\nhe tells you to have: take any of the others, for the one he wishes you\r\nto have is sure to contain some poison. Later on, when you retire to\r\nrest, do not spend the night on the mat spread out for you, but sleep\r\nsomewhere else, and put the wooden mortar for pounding paddy on the mat\r\nin your stead; and so again on the second night, place the wooden mill\r\nfor husking the paddy on your mat; and on the third night a roll of the\r\ncoarse matting used for treading paddy. If his three attempts to kill\r\nyou are unsuccessful, then he will be in your power, and will do what\r\nyou command. But even then there is still danger, and you must not do\r\nanything rash, but ask my advice again later on. But go outside now into\r\nthe veranda, for I think I hear my brother returning from his bath. I\r\nmust make haste and put out the food for you all to eat.”\r\n\r\nSoon the Were-Tiger came in, and, sitting on the mat by Danjai, asked him\r\nthe news and how matters were in his country. Danjai answered little,\r\nfor he was very sad; besides, his host always laughed at him whenever he\r\nspoke. The fact was that he was amused at the idea of the man whose wife\r\nhe had killed sitting in his veranda and talking to him in a friendly way.\r\n\r\nThe sister came out of the room and asked them in to have their meal. All\r\nhappened as she said it would. Danjai remembered her advice, and did not\r\ntake the plate of rice his host offered him. But he was too sad to eat\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Danjai and the Were-Tiger sat by a fire in the veranda.\r\nOver this fire hung several human heads. The tears came into Danjai’s\r\neyes as he sat there and saw the head of his dear wife being scorched by\r\nthe fire. He felt inclined there and then to grasp his sword and attack\r\nher murderer; but he restrained himself, remembering the advice of the\r\nTiger’s sister.\r\n\r\nThe Were-Tiger said to him with a nasty laugh: “What is troubling you\r\nthat you should weep?”\r\n\r\n“I am not troubled about anything,” said Danjai; “but the smoke of the\r\nfire is too much for my eyes, and it makes them water and feel sore.”\r\n\r\n“If so,” said his host, “let us put out the fire and retire to rest, as\r\nit is very late.”\r\n\r\nTwo mats were spread out for them, one on each side of the fireplace, and\r\nthey lay down to sleep. But Danjai kept awake, and when his companion was\r\nasleep, he rose and placed the wooden mortar for pounding paddy on his\r\nmat, and covered it over with a sheet; and he himself retired to a safe\r\nplace, as he was advised to do by the Tiger’s sister. He watched to see\r\nwhat would happen, and he was not disappointed. Not long after, he saw\r\nthe Were-Tiger wake up and fetch a sword, and walk up to the place where\r\nhe was supposed to be asleep. With the sword he made two or three vicious\r\ncuts at the wooden mortar, and said:\r\n\r\n“Now, Danjai, this will settle you. You will not think of revenging\r\nyourself on me any more.”\r\n\r\nThen Danjai cried out from where he was: “What is the matter? What are\r\nyou doing?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Danjai! Is that you?” said his host. “I did not mean to hurt you. I\r\nhad a bad dream, and I sometimes walk in my sleep. How lucky it is you\r\nwere not lying on the mat! I should have certainly killed you, and I\r\nshould never have forgiven myself for doing so. Please understand I meant\r\nno harm to you, and let us lie down to rest again.”\r\n\r\nOn the two following nights the Were-Tiger attempted to kill Danjai, but\r\nfailed each time, because, following the advice given him, Danjai placed\r\nfirst the wooden mill for husking the paddy on his mat, and next a roll\r\nof coarse matting used for treading paddy. His host made the same excuse\r\nfor his strange behaviour each time.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day, after the Were-Tiger had left the house\r\nto see whether any fish had been caught in his fish-trap, his sister\r\nasked Danjai to come into the room, as she had something to say to him\r\nbefore he left to return home.\r\n\r\n“Now, Danjai,” she said, “as I told you before, since my brother has\r\nnot been able to kill you these three days, he is in your power. After\r\nbreakfast ask him to accompany you and show you the way back to your\r\ncountry. When you have both come to the farther end of the sugar-cane\r\nplantation, beg him to sit down for a little while, and say you would\r\nlike to eat some sugar-cane before you leave him and go on your journey\r\nalone. When he gives you the sugar-cane, ask him to lend you his sword,\r\ngiving as an excuse that yours is not sharp enough for peeling the\r\nsugar-cane, or that it is stuck fast in its sheath and cannot be drawn.\r\nWhen he hands you his sword, you must attack him with it and kill him.\r\nMy brother is invulnerable to any other sword but his own. When you have\r\nkilled him, cut off his head and bring it to me, and I will give you your\r\nwife’s head in exchange for it.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes after this conversation the Were-Tiger returned with a\r\nbasket full of fish. Some of these were soon cooked, and they sat down to\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nSoon after they had eaten, Danjai told his host that he must be returning\r\nto his own country, and asked him to accompany him and show him his\r\nway back. So they started together and walked through the sugar-cane\r\nplantation.\r\n\r\nJust as they came near the end of it, Danjai begged his companion to\r\nstop. He said he would like to have some sugar-cane before going on.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry I did not offer you any,” said the Were-Tiger; “it was very\r\nforgetful of me. Never mind, I will at once cut down some sugar-cane for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had brought the sugar-cane and had finished peeling the piece he\r\nwanted for himself, Danjai said to him:\r\n\r\n“Please lend me your sword, for mine is stuck fast in its sheath, and I\r\ncannot draw it out.”\r\n\r\nThe Were-Tiger, suspecting nothing, handed the sword to him, and Danjai\r\nbegan peeling his sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nJust then the Were-Tiger turned round to look at his house, and Danjai,\r\nseizing his opportunity, gave him a blow with the sword and killed him.\r\nThen he cut off the head and carried it back with him to the house he had\r\njust left.\r\n\r\nWhen he came near, he saw the sister watching for his return, and\r\nstanding at the top of the ladder leading up to the house. He followed\r\nher into the house, and gave her the head of her brother.\r\n\r\n“You ought to be quite satisfied now, Danjai,” she said, “for you have\r\ntaken your revenge for the death of your wife. I want you to promise me\r\ncertain things before you go. First of all, you must not let anybody know\r\nthat you have killed my brother. Next, on your return, you must go on the\r\nwarpath and bring back to me the head of a woman, to enable me to put\r\naway the mourning of myself and my relatives for the death of my brother.\r\nAnd then I hope you will take me with you as your wife. And I give you\r\nnow some locks of my hair, to be used as a charm to make you invisible\r\nto the enemy, when you are on the warpath. Lastly, I advise you and your\r\npeople never to eat or to take away any fruit you may find lying about\r\nin the jungle, on the stump of a tree, or on a rock, without knowing for\r\ncertain who put it there and to whom it belongs, or making sure that it\r\nhas fallen from some tree near. This must be remembered from generation\r\nto generation. Whoever disobeys this advice will be punished by death.\r\nYou may now have the head of your wife to take back to your country.”\r\n\r\nAs she finished speaking, she handed him his wife’s head, and Danjai\r\nstarted off at once, for he was anxious to get back.\r\n\r\nHe reached his house late that same evening. All his friends were glad to\r\nsee him come back safe and sound. They had given up all hope of seeing\r\nhim again. They were also pleased to see he had been successful in\r\nbringing back the head of his dead wife.\r\n\r\nSoon after Danjai’s return from the Were-Tiger’s country, he gathered\r\nall his followers together and told them that he intended going on the\r\nwarpath. As soon as they were able to get everything ready, they started\r\nfor the enemy’s country. They were very successful, and succeeded in\r\ntaking many heads; but Danjai, protected as he was by the charm which he\r\nhad received from the Were-Tiger’s sister, was more successful than the\r\nothers. They resumed with much rejoicing, and a great feast was held in\r\nhonour of their victory. The human heads were placed on a costly dish,\r\nand the women carried them into the house with dancing and singing.\r\n\r\nA few days after, Danjai started to fulfil his promise to the\r\nWere-Tiger’s sister. He brought her back with him as his wife, and they\r\nlived very happily together for many years.\r\n\r\nThis story explains why the Dyaks, even at the present day, dare not eat\r\nany fruit they may find lying on the stump of a tree, or on a rock in the\r\njungle. They fear that evil will happen to them as it did to Danjai’s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE STORY OF SIU, WHO FIRST TAUGHT THE DYAKS TO PLANT PADDY AND TO\r\nOBSERVE THE OMENS OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    Many thousands of years ago, before the paddy-plant was known,\r\n    the Dyaks lived on tapioca, yams, potatoes, and such fruit as\r\n    they could procure. It was not till Siu taught them how to\r\n    plant paddy that such a thing as rice was known. The story of\r\n    how he came to learn of the existence of this important article\r\n    of food, and how he and his son Seragunting introduced it among\r\n    their people, is set forth in the following pages.\r\n\r\nSiu was the son of a great Dyak Chief. His father died when he was quite\r\na child, and at the time this story begins he lived with his mother,\r\nand was the head of a long Dyak house in which lived some three hundred\r\nfamilies. He was strong and active, and handsome in appearance, and\r\nthere was no one in the country round equal to him either in strength or\r\ncomeliness. When ready to go on the warpath, he was the admiration of\r\nall the Dyak damsels. On these occasions he appeared in a many-coloured\r\nwaist-cloth, twelve fathoms in length, wound round and round his body.\r\nOn his head he wore a plaited rattan band, in which were stuck some\r\nlong feathers of the hornbill. His coat was woven of threads of bright\r\ncolours. On each well-shaped arm was an armlet of ivory. To his belt were\r\nfastened his sword and the many charms and amulets that he possessed.\r\nWith his spear in his right hand and his shield on his left arm, he\r\npresented a splendid type of a Dyak warrior. But it is not of Siu’s\r\nbravery nor of his deeds of valour against the enemy that this tale\r\nrelates. It tells only of an adventure which ended in his discovery of\r\npaddy.\r\n\r\nHe proposed to the young men of his house that they should take their\r\nblowpipes with them and go into the jungle to shoot birds. So one morning\r\nthey all started early. Each man had with him his bundle of food for the\r\nday, and each went a different way, as they wished to see, on returning\r\nin the evening, who would be the most successful of them all.\r\n\r\nSiu went towards a mountain not far from his house, and wandered about\r\nthe whole morning in the jungle, but, strange to say, he did not see any\r\nbird, nor did he meet with any animal. Everything was very quiet and\r\nstill. Worn out with fatigue, he sat down to rest under a large tree,\r\nand, feeling hungry, he ate some of the food he had brought with him.\r\nIt was now long past midday, and he had not been able to kill a single\r\nbird! Surely none of the others could be so unfortunate as he! Determined\r\nnot to be beaten by the others, after a short rest he started again,\r\nand wandered on in quest of birds. The sun had gone half-way down in\r\nthe western heaven, and Siu was beginning to lose heart, when suddenly\r\nhe heard not far off the sound of birds. Hurrying in that direction, he\r\ncame to a wild fig-tree covered with ripe fruit, which a large number of\r\nbirds were busy eating. Never before had he seen such a sight! On this\r\none tree the whole feathered population of the forest seemed to have\r\nassembled together! Looking more carefully, he was surprised to see that\r\nthe different kinds of birds were not all intermingled together as is\r\nusually the case, but each species was apart from the others. He saw a\r\nlarge flock of wild pigeons on one branch, and next to them were the\r\nparrots, all feeding together, but keeping distinct from them. Upon the\r\nsame tree there were hornbills, woodpeckers, wild pigeons, and all the\r\ndifferent kinds of birds he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nSiu hid himself under the thick leaves of a shrub growing near, very\r\nmuch pleased at his luck, and, taking a poisoned dart, he placed it in\r\nhis blow-pipe, and shot it out. He had aimed at one bird in a particular\r\nflock, and hit it. But that bird was not the only one that fell dead at\r\nhis feet. To his astonishment, he saw that many of the other birds near\r\nit were killed also. Again he shot out a dart, and again the same thing\r\nhappened. In a very short time Siu had killed as many birds as he could\r\ncarry. As the little basket in which he had brought his food was too\r\nsmall to hold them all, he set to work and made a coarse basket with the\r\nbark of a _pendok_ tree growing near. Then he put his load on his back\r\nand started to return home, glad that he had been so successful.\r\n\r\nHe tried to return the same way by which he had come, but as he had not\r\ntaken the precaution to cut marks in the trees he passed, he very soon\r\nfound himself in difficulties. He wandered about, sometimes passing by\r\nsome large tree which he seemed to remember seeing in the morning. He\r\nclimbed up a steep hill and went several miles through a large forest,\r\nbut did not find the jungle path which he had followed early in the day.\r\nIt was beginning to grow dusk and the sun had nearly set.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK USING A WOODEN BLOW-PIPE\r\n\r\nHe is seated on the ground with his blow-pipe held in position to his\r\nmouth. He is just in the act of blowing out one of his poisoned darts,\r\nsome of which are lying on the ground in front of him. To his waist is\r\nfastened the bamboo receptacle in which the darts are kept.]\r\n\r\n“I must hurry on,” said Siu to himself, “in the hope of finding some\r\nhouse where I can get food and shelter. Once it is dark I shall be forced\r\nto spend the night in the jungle.”\r\n\r\nComing to a part of the jungle which had lately been a garden, he thought\r\nthere must be a path from it leading to some house, so he began to walk\r\nround it. Soon he found an old disused path, which he followed. By this\r\ntime it was quite dark, and Siu made haste to reach the Dyak house which\r\nhe felt sure was not very far off. He came to a well, and near at hand he\r\nsaw the lights and heard the usual sounds of a Dyak house. He was glad to\r\nthink that he would not have to spend the night in the jungle, but would\r\nbe able to get food and shelter at the house. He stopped to have a bath,\r\nand hid the birds he was carrying and his blow-pipe and quiver in the\r\nbrushwood near the well, hoping to take them with him when he started to\r\nreturn the next morning.\r\n\r\nAs he approached the house, he could hear the voices of the people there.\r\nWhen he came to the bottom of the ladder leading up to the house, he\r\nshouted: “Oh, you people in the house, will you allow a stranger to walk\r\nup?” At once there was dead silence in the house. No one answered. Again\r\nSiu asked the same question, and after a pause a voice answered, “Yes;\r\ncome up!”\r\n\r\nHe walked up into the house. To his surprise he saw no one in the open\r\nveranda in front of the different rooms. That part of a Dyak house,\r\nusually so crowded, was quite empty. Nor did he hear the voices of people\r\ntalking in any of the rooms. All was silent. Even the person who answered\r\nhim was not there to receive him.\r\n\r\nHe saw a dim light in the veranda further on, in the middle of the house,\r\nand walked towards it, wondering the while what could have happened to\r\nall the people in the house, for not long before he had heard many voices.\r\n\r\n“This seems to be a strange house,” he said to himself. “When I was\r\nbathing, and when I walked up to the house, it seemed to be well\r\ninhabited, but now that I come in, I see no one and hear no voice.”\r\n\r\nWhen Siu reached the light he sat down on a mat. Presently he heard a\r\nwoman’s voice in the room say: “Sit down, Siu; I will bring out the\r\n_pinang_[3] and _sireh_[4] to you.”\r\n\r\nSiu was very pleased to hear a human voice. Soon a young and remarkably\r\nbeautiful girl came out of the room with the chewing ingredients, which\r\nshe placed before him.\r\n\r\n“Here you are at last, Siu,” she said; “I expected you would come\r\nearlier. How is it you are so late?”\r\n\r\nSiu explained that he had stopped at the well to have a bath, as he was\r\nhot and tired.\r\n\r\n“You must be very hungry,” said the girl; “wait a moment while I prepare\r\nsome food. After you have eaten, we can have our talk together.”\r\n\r\nWhen Siu was left to himself, he wondered what it all meant. Here was a\r\nlong Dyak house, built for more than a hundred families to live in, and\r\nyet it seemed quite deserted. The only person in it appeared to be the\r\nbeautiful girl who was cooking his food for him. Again, he was surprised\r\nthat she knew his name and expected him that day.\r\n\r\n“Come in, Siu,” said the voice from the room; “your food is ready.”\r\n\r\nSiu was very hungry, and went in at once, and sat down to eat his dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen they had done eating, she cleared away the plates and put things\r\nback into their places and tidied the room. Then she spread out a new\r\nmat for him, and brought out the _pinang_ and _sireh_, and bade him be\r\nseated, as she wished to have a chat with him.\r\n\r\nSiu had many questions to ask, and as soon as they were both seated, he\r\nbegan:—\r\n\r\n“Why are you all alone in this house? This is a long house, and many\r\nfamilies must live in it. Where are the others? Why is everything so\r\nsilent now? I am sure I heard voices before I entered the house; but now\r\nI hear no sound.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let us talk about this house or the people in it for the present.\r\nI would much rather talk of other matters. Tell me of your own people,\r\nand what news you bring from your country.”\r\n\r\n“There is no news to give you,” Siu replied. “We have been rather badly\r\noff for food, as our potatoes and yams did not turn out so well this year\r\nas we hoped.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what made you come in this direction, and how it was you found\r\nout this house.”\r\n\r\n“While I was hunting in the jungle to-day I lost my way. After wandering\r\nabout a long time, I found a path which I followed and came to this\r\nhouse. It was kind of you to take me in and give me food. If I had not\r\nfound this house, I would have been lost in the jungle. To-morrow morning\r\nyou must show me the way to my country, and also I must beg of you some\r\nfood for my journey back. My mother is sure to be anxious about me. She\r\nis left all alone now that I am away. My father died a long time ago,\r\nand I am her only son.”\r\n\r\n“Do not go away as soon as to-morrow morning. Stay here a few days at any\r\nrate.”\r\n\r\nAt first Siu would not consent, but she spoke so nicely to him that she\r\nsucceeded in persuading him to stay there at least a week. Then he went\r\nout to the veranda, and she brought out a mat for him to sleep on and a\r\nsheet to cover himself with. As Siu was very tired, he soon fell sound\r\nasleep, and did not wake up till late on the following morning.\r\n\r\nHe saw some little children playing about the next day, but he did not\r\nsee any grown-up people. He went into the room to have his morning meal,\r\nbut saw no one there, except the girl he had seen the evening before. He\r\nfelt very much inclined to ask her again where the people of the house\r\nwere, but he did not do so, as she did not seem inclined to speak about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNow though Siu knew it not, this was the house of the great Singalang\r\nBurong, the Ruler of the Spirit-World. He was able to metamorphose\r\nhimself and his followers into any form. When going forth on an\r\nexpedition against the enemy, he would transform himself and his\r\nfollowers into birds, so that they might travel more quickly. Over the\r\nhigh trees of the jungle, over the broad rivers, sometimes even across\r\nthe sea, Singalang Burong and his flock would fly. There was no trouble\r\nabout food, for in the forests there were always some wild trees in\r\nfruit, and, while assuming the form of birds, they lived on the food\r\nof birds. In his own house and among his own people, Singalang Burong\r\nappeared as a man. He had eight daughters, and the girl who was cooking\r\nfood for Siu was the youngest of them.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the people of the house were so quiet, and did not make\r\ntheir appearance, was because they were all in mourning for many of their\r\nrelatives who had been killed some time back. Only the women and children\r\nwere at home, because that same morning all the men had gone forth to\r\nmake a raid upon some neighbouring tribe, so that they might bring home\r\nsome human heads to enable them to end their mourning. For it was the\r\ncustom that the people of a house continued to be in mourning for dead\r\nrelatives until one or more human heads were brought to the house. Then a\r\nfeast was held, and all mourning was at an end.\r\n\r\nAfter Siu had been in the house seven days, he thought he ought to think\r\nof returning to his own people. By this time he was very much in love\r\nwith the girl who had been so kind to him, and he wished above all things\r\nto marry her, and take her back with him to his own country.\r\n\r\n“I have been here a whole week,” he said to her, “and though you have not\r\ntold me your name, still I seem to know you very well. I have a request\r\nto make, and I hope you will not be angry at what I say.”\r\n\r\n“Speak on; I promise I will not be angry whatever you may say.”\r\n\r\n“I have learnt to love you very much,” said Siu, “and I would like to\r\nmarry you if you will consent, so that I shall not leave you, but take\r\nyou with me, when I return to my own land. Also I wish you to tell me\r\nyour name, and why this house is so silent, and where all the people\r\nbelonging to it are.”\r\n\r\n“I will consent to marry you, for I also love you. But you must first\r\npromise me certain things. In the first place, you must not tell your\r\npeople of this house, and what you have seen here. Then also you must\r\npromise faithfully never to hurt a bird or even to hold one in your\r\nhands. If ever you break this promise, then we cease to be man and wife.\r\nAnd, of course, you must never kill a bird, because, if you do so, I\r\nshall not only leave you, but revenge myself on you. Do you promise these\r\nthings?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Siu; “I promise not to speak of what I have seen here until\r\nyou give me leave to do so. And as you do not wish it, I will never touch\r\nor handle a bird, and certainly never kill one.”\r\n\r\n“Now that you have promised what I wish, I will tell you about\r\nmyself and the people of this house,” said the maiden. “My name is\r\n_Endu-Sudan-Galinggam-Tinchin-Mas_ (the girl Sudan painted like a gold\r\nring), but my people call me by my pet names, _Bunsu Burong_ (the\r\nyoungest of the bird family), and _Bunsu Katupong_ (the youngest of the\r\n_Katupong_ family). This house, as you noticed, seems very empty. The\r\nreason is that a month ago many of our people were killed by some of the\r\npeople of your house, and we are all still in mourning for them. As you\r\nknow, when our relatives have lately died, we stay silent in our rooms,\r\nand do not come out to receive visitors or to entertain them. Why are\r\nyour people so cruel to us? They often kill our men when they go out\r\nfishing or hunting. On the morning of the day on which you arrived, all\r\nthe men of this house went on the warpath, so as to obtain the heads of\r\nsome of the enemy to enable us to put away our mourning. With us as with\r\nyou, it is necessary that one or more human heads be brought into the\r\nhouse before the inmates can give up sorrowing for their dead relatives\r\nand friends. You see us now in the form of human beings, but all the\r\npeople in this house are able to transform themselves into birds. My\r\nfather, Singalang Burong, is the head of this house. I am the youngest of\r\neight sisters; we have no brother alive. Our only brother died not long\r\nago, and we are still in mourning for him, and that is the reason why my\r\nsisters did not come out to greet you.”\r\n\r\nSiu heard with surprise all she had to say. He said to himself that it\r\nwas lucky he did not bring up to the house the basket of birds which he\r\nhad killed in the jungle, and that he had hidden them with his blow-pipe\r\nand quiver containing poisoned darts in the brushwood near the well.\r\nHe determined to say nothing about the matter, as probably some of her\r\nfriends or relations were among the birds that were killed by him.\r\n\r\nSo Siu married Bunsu Burong, and continued to live in the house for\r\nseveral weeks.\r\n\r\nOne day he said to his wife: “I have been here a long time. My people\r\nmust surely be wondering where I am, and whether I am still alive. My\r\nmother, too, must be very anxious about me. I should like to return to my\r\npeople, and I want you to accompany me. My mother and my friends are sure\r\nto welcome you as my wife.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I will gladly accompany you back to your home. But you must\r\nremember and say nothing of the things you have seen in this house. When\r\nshall we start?”\r\n\r\n“We can start early to-morrow morning, soon after breakfast,” answered\r\nSiu.\r\n\r\nThey started early the next day, taking with them food enough for four\r\ndays, as they expected the journey would last as long as that. Siu’s wife\r\nseemed to know the way, and after journeying for three days, they came to\r\nthe stream near the house, and they stopped to have a bath. Some of the\r\nchildren of the house saw them there, and ran up to the house, and said:\r\n“Siu has come back, and with him is a beautiful woman, who seems to be\r\nhis wife.”\r\n\r\nSome of the older people checked the children, saying: “It cannot be Siu;\r\nhe has been dead for a long time. Don’t mention his name, for if his\r\nmother hears you talk of him, it will make her very unhappy.”\r\n\r\nBut the children persisted in saying that it was indeed Siu that they had\r\nseen. Just then Siu and his wife appeared and walked up to the house.\r\n\r\nSiu said to his wife: “The door before which I hang up my sword is the\r\ndoor of my room. Walk straight in. You will find my mother there, and she\r\nwill be sure to gladly welcome you as her daughter-in-law.”\r\n\r\nWhen they came into the house, all the inmates rushed out to meet\r\nthem, and to congratulate Siu on his safe return. They asked him many\r\nquestions: where had he been living all this time? how he came to be\r\nmarried? and what was the name of his wife’s country? But Siu answered\r\nlittle, as he remembered the promise he had made to his wife, that he\r\nwould not speak of what he had seen in her house.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the door of his room, Siu hung up his sword, and his\r\nwife went into the room. But she did not see his mother, as she was ill,\r\nand was lying in her mosquito-curtain. Then Siu followed his wife into\r\nthe room, and called out: “Mother, where are you? Here is your son Siu\r\ncome back!”\r\n\r\nBut his mother made no answer, so he opened her curtain, and saw her\r\nlying down, covered up with a blanket. She had been so troubled at the\r\nthought that her son was dead, that she had refused to eat, and had\r\nbecome quite ill.\r\n\r\nShe would not believe that her son had really returned alive, and she\r\nsaid: “Do not try to deceive me; my son Siu is dead.”\r\n\r\n“I am indeed your son Siu, and I have come back alive and well!”\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied, “my son Siu is dead. Leave me alone; I have not long\r\nto live. Let me die in peace, and follow my son to the grave.”\r\n\r\nSiu then went to the box in which his clothes were kept and put on the\r\nthings that his mother had often seen him wear. Then he went to her\r\nagain, and said: “Even if you do not believe that I am your son, at any\r\nrate you might turn round and look at me, to make sure that I am not your\r\nson.”\r\n\r\nThen she looked at him, and saw that it was indeed her son. She was so\r\npleased at his return that she soon recovered from her illness, which was\r\nreally caused by her sorrow and refusal to eat. Siu told his mother of\r\nhis marriage, and she welcomed his wife with joy.\r\n\r\nThe women all crowded round Siu’s wife, and asked her what her name\r\nwas. She answered: “_Endu-Sudan-Galinggam-Tinchin-Mas_” (The girl Sudan\r\npainted like a gold ring). They looked at her in surprise; they had never\r\nheard of such a name before.\r\n\r\n“Where do you come from?” they asked. “What is the name of your country?”\r\n\r\n“_Nanga Niga Bekurong Bebali nyadi Tekuyong Mabong_” (The mouth of the\r\nhidden Niga stream changed into an empty shell),[5] was the reply.\r\n\r\nThey were astonished at her answer. They had never heard of such a\r\ncountry. They asked her of her people, but she would not say anything\r\nmore of herself or speak about her people.\r\n\r\nEverybody admired the great beauty of Siu’s wife. No more questions were\r\nasked of her, as she seemed unwilling to answer. Her parentage remained a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nIn process of time Siu’s wife bore him a son whom they named Seragunting.\r\nHe was a fine child, and as befitted the grandson of Singalang Burong, he\r\ngrew big and strong in a miraculously short time, and when he was three\r\nyears old, he was taller and stronger than others four times his age.\r\n\r\nOne day, as Seragunting was playing with the other boys, a man brought up\r\nsome birds which he had caught in a trap. As he walked through the house\r\nhe passed Siu, who was sitting in the open veranda. Siu, forgetting the\r\npromise he had made to his wife, asked him to show him the birds, and he\r\ntook one in his hands and stroked it. His wife was sitting not far off,\r\nand saw him hold the bird, and was very much vexed that he had broken his\r\npromise to her.\r\n\r\nShe got up and returned to her room. Siu came in and noticed that she was\r\ntroubled, and asked her what was wrong. She said that she was only tired.\r\n\r\nShe said to herself: “My husband has broken his word to me. He has done\r\nthe thing he promised me he would never do. I told him he was never to\r\nhold a bird in his hands, and that if he did such a thing, I would leave\r\nhim. I cannot stay here in this house any longer. I must return to the\r\nhouse of my father, Singalang Burong.”\r\n\r\nShe took the water-vessels in her hands, and went out as if to fetch\r\nwater. But when she came to the well, she placed the water-vessels on the\r\nground and disappeared in the jungle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK GIRL\r\n\r\nSeated on a mat and folding up a petticoat before putting it away. The\r\ngirls are very careful of their clothing and are often very vain, but\r\nwhen they are married they frequently become very untidy. A woman’s\r\nwardrobe is not extensive. It consists of two petticoats and one jacket\r\nas a general rule.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCRAPING PALM LEAVES FOR FIBRE\r\n\r\nWith this the women tie up the threads they weave, so that when they are\r\ndipped in any particular dye the parts which are tied may not be affected\r\nby the dye. It is by this means that the different patterns in Dyak cloth\r\nare obtained.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Seragunting, tired with his play, came back in search of\r\nhis mother. She was very fond indeed of him, and he expected her to come\r\nto him as soon as he called out to her. But he was disappointed. No one\r\nanswered his call, and when he looked in the room she was not there. He\r\nasked his father where his mother was, and he told him that she had just\r\ngone to the well to fetch water, and would soon be back.\r\n\r\nBut hour after hour passed, and she did not return to the house. So\r\nSeragunting began to be anxious, and asked his father to accompany him to\r\nthe well to look for her. At first his father refused to do so, but when\r\nhe saw his son crying for his mother, he went with him to the well. They\r\nfound the water-vessels there, but saw no signs of her.\r\n\r\n“Your mother is not here, Seragunting,” said Siu. “Perhaps she has gone\r\nto the garden to get some vegetables for our dinner. Let us go back to\r\nthe house. If your mother is not back early to-morrow morning, we will go\r\nand look for her.” So they both returned to the house, taking back with\r\nthem the water-gourds which Siu’s wife had left at the well.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning Seragunting and his father went in search of her.\r\nThey took with them only a little food, as they expected to find her not\r\nvery far off. But they wandered the whole day, and saw no signs of her.\r\nThey spent the night under a large tree in the jungle. Early the next\r\nmorning they were surprised to find a small bundle of food, wrapped up in\r\nleaves, near Seragunting. This food was evidently meant for him alone,\r\nas it was not enough for two, but he gave some of it to his father, who\r\nate sparingly of it, so that his son might not be hungry. They wandered\r\non for several days, and every night the same strange thing occurred—a\r\nbundle of food was left near Seragunting. Siu suggested to his son that\r\nthey should return; but Seragunting, who during the journey had grown up\r\ninto a strong lad, with a will of his own, would not consent to do so, as\r\nhe was determined to find his mother.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on for several days, deeper and deeper into the jungle, but\r\ncould find no signs of her whom they sought. At last they came to the\r\nsea-shore. Here they rested for some days, in the hope that some boat\r\nmight pass. Still, as before, each morning a bundle of food was found by\r\nSeragunting. If it were not for this food, they would have long ago died\r\nof starvation. On this they managed to live, waiting hopefully to see\r\nsome boat appear to take them on their journey.\r\n\r\nOne day as Seragunting was watching, he heard the sound of paddles, and\r\nsaw in the distance several long boats approaching. He hailed the first,\r\nand asked the men in it to take him and his father with them. The boat\r\nmade for the shore, but the man in the bows recognized the two wanderers,\r\nand shouted out: “It is Siu and his son Seragunting; do not let them come\r\ninto the boat.” The boat went on and left them to their fate. The same\r\nthing happened in the case of each of the other boats. As soon as Siu and\r\nhis son were recognized, no one would help them.\r\n\r\nNow these were the boats of the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong:\r\nKatupong, Beragai, Bejampong, Papau, Nendak, Kutok, and Embuas. They were\r\nnot pleased at their sister-in-law marrying a mere mortal like Siu, and\r\nso refused to help him and his son.\r\n\r\nThe next day Seragunting saw what seemed to be a dark cloud come towards\r\nhim over the sea. As it came nearer, it took the form of a gigantic\r\nspider, carrying some food and clothes.\r\n\r\n“Do not be afraid,” said the Spider; “I have come to help you and your\r\nfather. I have brought you food and clothing. When you have eaten and\r\nchanged your clothes I will take you across the water to the land on the\r\nother side. My name is Emplawa Jawa (the Spider of Java). I know your\r\nhistory, and I will lead you to your mother whom you seek.”\r\n\r\nAfter they had eaten and put on the new clothes brought them, the spider\r\ntold them to go with him across the sea. They were not to be afraid,\r\nbut to follow his track, not turning to the right hand nor to the left.\r\nThey obeyed his words. Strange to say, the water became as hard as a\r\nsandbank under their feet. For a long time they were out of sight of\r\nland, but towards evening they approached the opposite shore, and saw a\r\nlanding-place where there were a large number of boats. Not far off were\r\nseveral houses, and one longer and more imposing than any of the others.\r\nTo this house the Spider directed Seragunting, telling him that he would\r\nfind his mother there. The Spider then left them. As it was late, they\r\ndid not go up to the house that evening, but spent the night in one of\r\nthe boats at the landing-place. Among the boats were those belonging to\r\nthe sons-in-law of Singalang Burong, which had passed Siu and his son as\r\nthey waited on the sea-shore for some boat to take them across the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen Seragunting and his father woke up next morning, they saw that the\r\nroad leading up to the house had sharpened pieces of bamboo planted close\r\ntogether to prevent their walking up to it. As they were wondering what\r\nthey were to do next, a fly came to Seragunting, and said:\r\n\r\n“Do not be afraid to walk up. Tread on the spikes that I alight on; they\r\nwill not hurt you. When you come to the house you will find swords with\r\nblades turned upwards fastened to the ladder. Tread on the blades that I\r\nalight on, and walk boldly up into the house.”\r\n\r\nThey did as the fly advised them, and were not hurt. The bamboo spikes\r\ncrumbled under their feet, and the sword-blades they trod on were blunt\r\nand harmless.\r\n\r\nThe people of the house took no notice of them, and they sat down in the\r\nveranda of the house. Then the fly came to Seragunting, and whispered to\r\nhim: “You must now follow me into the room. Your mother is there, lying\r\nin her mosquito curtain. I will point out to you which it is, and you\r\nmust wake her up and tell her who you are. She will be very pleased to\r\nsee you. Then when you come out into the veranda and see the sons-in-law\r\nof Singalang Burong, you must greet them as your uncles. They will disown\r\nyou, and pretend that you are no relation of theirs. But do not be\r\nafraid. You will be victorious in the end.”\r\n\r\nSeragunting followed the fly into the room, and went to the curtain on\r\nwhich it alighted. He called out to his mother, and she awoke and saw\r\nwith joy her son. She embraced him, and he said to her:\r\n\r\n“How is it you went away and left us? We missed you so much, and were so\r\nsorry to lose you, that my father and I have been travelling for many\r\ndays and nights in search of you. Now our troubles are over, for I have\r\nfound you.”\r\n\r\n“My dear son,” she said as she caressed him, “though I left you I did not\r\nforget you. It was I who placed the food by you every night. I left your\r\nfather because he broke the promise he made to me. But you are my own\r\nson, and I have been wishing to see you ever since I left your house.\r\nIt was I who sent the Spider to help you and show you your way here. My\r\nlove for you is as great as it ever was. We will go out now into the\r\nveranda, and I will introduce you to your uncles and aunts, and to your\r\ngrandfather. They may not welcome you, because they were opposed to my\r\nmarriage to your father. But do not fear them. We will be more than a\r\nmatch for them all.”\r\n\r\nThen she spoke to her husband Siu, whom she was glad to meet again. All\r\nthree then went out into the veranda, which was now full of people.\r\nSeragunting called the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong his uncles, but\r\nthey refused to acknowledge him as their nephew.\r\n\r\nThey proposed several ordeals to prove the truth of his words, that he\r\nwas indeed the grandson of Singalang Burong. In all of these Seragunting\r\ncame off victorious.\r\n\r\nAs the men and boys were spinning their tops, they asked Seragunting to\r\njoin them. He had no top of his own, so he asked his mother for one. She\r\ntook an egg and uttered some mysterious words over it, and immediately it\r\nbecame a top. This she gave to her son, who went and joined the others\r\nin the game. Whenever Seragunting aimed at a top, he always hit it and\r\nsmashed it. None of the others were a match for him. In a short time all\r\nthe tops, except that of Seragunting, were broken in pieces.\r\n\r\nThen they suggested a wrestling match. Seragunting was quite ready to try\r\na fall with any of them, old or young. Some of their best wrestlers came\r\nforward. The first two were overthrown by him so easily, that the others\r\nsaw it was no use their attempting to wrestle with Seragunting.\r\n\r\nAs a last trial they proposed that all should go out hunting. Here they\r\nhoped to be more fortunate. All the sons-in-law of Singalang Burong took\r\ntheir good hunting dogs with them, confident of success. Seragunting was\r\ntold that he could have any of the other dogs left in the house. There\r\nhe saw a few old dogs, weak and useless for hunting. With these he was\r\nexpected to compete against the others, and if he were not successful,\r\nboth he and his father were to be killed! Seragunting consented even to\r\nsuch an unfair ordeal as that. He called to him an old sickly-looking\r\ndog and gently stroked it. At once it became young and strong! While the\r\nothers went forth into the jungle with a pack of hounds, Seragunting was\r\nonly accompanied by one dog. In the evening Katupong, Beragai, Bejampong,\r\nand the others all returned unsuccessful. Soon after Seragunting’s dog\r\nappeared, chasing a huge boar, which made a stand at the foot of the\r\nladder of the house. Seragunting asked the others to kill the beast if\r\nthey dared. The spears cast at it glided off and left the beast unharmed.\r\nSome of those who were rash enough to go near the animal had a close\r\nescape from being torn in pieces by its tusks.\r\n\r\nSeragunting, armed with nothing better than a little knife belonging to\r\nhis mother, walked up to the infuriated animal and stabbed it in a vital\r\npart, and it fell down dead at his feet.\r\n\r\nAfter these marvellous feats, all were compelled to admit that\r\nSeragunting was a true grandson of the great Singalang Burong. They all\r\nacknowledged him as such, and he was taken to his grandfather, who was\r\npleased to see the lad, and promised to help him throughout his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DYAKS MAKING A DAM FOR TUBA FISHING\r\n\r\nThe poison from the _tuba_ root is put in the water some distance up\r\nriver, and the Dyaks follow it as it drifts, and spear and net the\r\npoisoned fish. The _tuba_ does not seem to affect the flesh of the fish,\r\nwhich can be cooked and eaten. Many fish swim down river to escape the\r\npoison. These come to this dam, in which there is an opening leading to\r\nan enclosure; in this the fish congregate and are afterwards captured.]\r\n\r\nBut Siu was unhappy in his new home. He could not help thinking of his\r\nmother, whom he had left alone, and he was anxious to return to his own\r\npeople. He begged his wife to accompany him back to his old home, but she\r\nrefused to do so. It was decided that Siu and his son should stay in the\r\nhouse of Singalang Burong till they had obtained such knowledge as would\r\nbe useful to them in the future, and that then they were to return to the\r\nlower world, bringing with them the secrets they had learnt from those\r\nwiser and more powerful than themselves.\r\n\r\nAll the people of the house were now most kind to Siu and his son, and\r\nwere most anxious to teach them all they could. They were taken on a war\r\nexpedition against the enemy, so that they might learn the science and\r\nart of Dyak warfare. They were taught how to set traps to catch deer and\r\nwild pig. They were shown the different methods of catching fish, and\r\nlearnt to make the different kinds of fish-trap used by the Dyaks of the\r\npresent day. They remained in Singalang Burong’s house that whole year so\r\nthat they might have a complete and practical knowledge of the different\r\nstages of paddy-growing.\r\n\r\nWhen the year was ended, Seragunting’s mother took him and Siu to see her\r\nfather, Singalang Burong, so that they might receive from him his advice,\r\nas well as such charms as he might wish to give them before they left to\r\nreturn to the lower world of mortals.\r\n\r\nSingalang Burong was sitting in his chair of state, and received them\r\nmost kindly. He bade them be seated on the mat at his feet, as he had\r\nmany things to say to them. Then he explained to Siu and his son who\r\nhe was, and the worship due to him, and they learnt also about the\r\nobservance of omens, both good and bad.\r\n\r\n“I am the Ruler of the Spirit-World,” said Singalang Burong, “and have\r\nthe power to make men successful in all they undertake. At all times if\r\nyou wish for my help, you must call upon me and make offerings to me.\r\nEspecially must this be done before you go to fight against the enemy,\r\nfor I am the God of War, and help those who pay me due respect.\r\n\r\n“You have learnt here how to plant paddy. I will give you some paddy\r\nto take away with you, and when you get back to your own country, you\r\ncan teach men how to cultivate it. You will find rice a much more\r\nstrengthening article of food than the yams and potatoes you used to live\r\nupon, and you will become a strong and hardy race.\r\n\r\n“And to help you in your daily work, my sons-in-law will always tell\r\nyou whether that you do is right or wrong. In every work that you\r\nundertake you must pay heed to the voices of the sacred birds—_Katupong_,\r\n_Beragai_, _Bejampong_, _Papau_, _Nendak_, _Kutok_, and _Embuas_. These\r\nbirds, named after my sons-in-law, represent them, and are the means by\r\nwhich I make known my wishes to mankind. When you hear them, remember\r\nit is myself speaking through my sons-in-law for encouragement or for\r\nwarning. Whatever work you may be engaged in,—farm-work, house-building,\r\nfishing, or hunting—wherever you may be you must always do as these birds\r\ndirect. Whenever you have a feast, you must make an offering to me, and\r\nyou must call upon my sons-in-law to come and partake of the feast. If\r\nyou do not do these things, some evil is sure to happen to you. I am\r\nwilling to help you and to give you prosperity, but I expect due respect\r\nto be paid to me, and will not allow my commands to be disobeyed.”\r\n\r\nThen Singalang Burong presented them with many charms to take away with\r\nthem. They were of various kinds. Some had the power to make the owner\r\nbrave and fortunate in war. Others were to preserve him in good health,\r\nor to make him successful in his paddy-planting, and cause him to have\r\ngood harvests.\r\n\r\nSiu and Seragunting then bade their friends farewell and started to\r\nreturn. As soon as they had descended the ladder of the house of\r\nSingalang Burong, they were swiftly transported through the air by\r\nsome mysterious power, and in a moment they found themselves at the\r\nbathing-place of their own house.\r\n\r\nTheir friends crowded round them, glad to see them back safe and well.\r\nThey were taken with much rejoicing to the house. Friends and neighbours\r\nwere told of their return, and a great meeting was held that evening.\r\nAll gathered round the two adventurers, who told them of their strange\r\nexperiences in the far country of the Spirit Birds. The charms received\r\nfrom Singalang Burong were handed round for general admiration. The new\r\nseed, paddy, was produced, and the good qualities of rice as an article\r\nof food explained. The people congregated there had never seen paddy\r\nbefore, but all determined to be guided by Siu and Seragunting, and to\r\nplant it in future. The different names of the sacred birds were told to\r\nthe assembled people, and all were warned to pay due respect to their\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nAnd so, according to the ancient legend, ended the old primitive life of\r\nthe Dyak, when he lived upon such poor food as the fruits of the jungle,\r\nand any yams and potatoes he happened to plant near his house; the old\r\nblind existence, in which there was nothing to guide him; and then began\r\nhis new life, in which he advanced forward a step, and learnt to have\r\nregularly, year by year, his seed-time and harvest, and to know that\r\nthere were unseen powers ruling the universe, whose will might be learnt\r\nby mankind, and obedience to whom would bring success and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PULANG-GANA, AND HOW HE CAME TO BE WORSHIPPED AS THE GOD OF THE\r\nEARTH.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, though the Dyaks knew of paddy, and planted it every\r\nyear, yet they had very poor crops, because they did not know what god\r\nowned the land, and as they did not offer him sacrifices he did nothing\r\nto help them. In those days there lived together seven brothers and\r\ntheir only sister. The brothers’ names were Bui-Nasi, Belang-Pinggang,\r\nBejit-Manai, Bunga-Jawa, Litan-Dai, Kenyawang, and Pulang-Gana, and the\r\nsister’s Puchong-Kempat. They lived on a hill by the side of a broad\r\nriver. On all sides were wide plains, and beyond them high hills rose in\r\nthe distance. Most of these plains were covered with thick jungle, and\r\nonly a few clearings where paddy had been planted could be seen.\r\n\r\nNot far from the house the brothers had a garden in which they planted\r\npotatoes, yams, sugar-cane, and tapioca; but a porcupine would often\r\ncome at night and do much damage to the garden. They bade their youngest\r\nbrother, Pulang-Gana, keep watch, directing him to drive away the\r\nanimal or kill it if he could. But all his efforts were vain. When he\r\nwas awake the animal did not come, but as soon as he fell asleep the\r\nporcupine would creep in quietly and eat up the potatoes and yams. The\r\nelder brothers were not kind to Pulang-Gana. They would not keep watch\r\nthemselves, but whenever they saw fresh damage done they not only scolded\r\ntheir younger brother, but beat him with sticks.\r\n\r\n“He is only lazy,” they said, “and deserves a thrashing. He does nothing\r\nbut sleep, and is too lazy to wake up at night and drive the porcupine\r\naway!”\r\n\r\nPoor Pulang-Gana! His was a hard lot indeed!\r\n\r\nHe determined to keep careful watch one night, and, whatever it cost him,\r\nto kill the porcupine, so that his brothers might have no more cause for\r\nblaming him. That night he did not sleep at all. The porcupine came just\r\nbefore dawn, when all was still. Pulang-Gana was awake, and went after\r\nit, determined to kill it. The animal ran away, and Pulang-Gana followed.\r\nThe moon was shining brightly, and he had no difficulty in seeing in what\r\ndirection the animal went. Every now and then the porcupine stopped, but\r\nas soon as Pulang-Gana came up it started off again, and he was not able\r\nto kill it; so the animal went on, and Pulang-Gana followed, determined\r\nnot to give up the chase until he had effected his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to rise in the east, and still Pulang-Gana pursued\r\nthe porcupine.\r\n\r\n“Sooner or later,” he said to himself, “I must catch it up. The animal is\r\nalready tired. I will not return home till I have killed it.”\r\n\r\nThe porcupine now came to the foot of a rocky mountain. Pulang-Gana,\r\nthinking the chase would soon be over, hurried on, but before he could\r\nreach the animal it had escaped through an opening in the solid rock. The\r\ncave into which it had disappeared was large enough for a man to stand\r\nupright in, and Pulang-Gana said to himself:—\r\n\r\n“Now I have you. Wait till I have a light to show me where you are, and\r\nthen I will come in and kill you.”\r\n\r\nHe collected some dry branches, and tied them together for a torch. He\r\nfound a piece of dry soft wood, and also a short stick of some hard wood,\r\nthe point of which he sharpened. With the palms of his hands he worked\r\nthe small stick and drilled a hole in the soft wood. Soon it began to\r\nsmoke, and with the aid of some dry twigs he blew the fire into a blaze;\r\nthen he lighted his torch, and hurried into the cave after the porcupine.\r\n\r\nHe saw the animal a little distance ahead of him, and followed it\r\nleisurely. There was no need for haste, as he would be able to kill it\r\neasily enough when he drove it to the end of the cave, and it had no\r\nmeans of escape. The cave seemed to extend a great way into the mountain.\r\nAfter a few hours’ walking Pulang-Gana was surprised to come to an\r\nopening in the rock, through which the porcupine had evidently escaped.\r\nOutside the sun was shining brightly. Pulang-Gana went through this\r\nopening, but, though he looked in all directions, he could see no signs\r\nof the porcupine.\r\n\r\nHe was uncertain what he ought to do next. The porcupine had escaped,\r\nand there was no chance of his being able to kill it. He did not feel\r\ninclined to return to his brothers, because they were all unkind to him.\r\nOn the other hand, he did not know if this new country in which he found\r\nhimself was inhabited; and, if inhabited, whether the people would treat\r\nhim kindly. Looking around, he saw smoke arising some distance off, and\r\nguessed that it was a Dyak house. As he was hungry, he decided to make\r\nfor it, hoping the inmates would be kind to him and give him food.\r\n\r\nAs Pulang-Gana came nearer, he saw the house was a very long one,\r\ninhabited by about one hundred families. He stopped at the bottom of the\r\nladder leading up to the house, and, following the Dyak custom, asked in\r\na loud voice if he might walk up.\r\n\r\n“Yes; come up, Pulang-Gana,” said a voice in reply. “We have been\r\nexpecting you for some time, and will be glad to see you.”\r\n\r\nHe was surprised that his name should be known in this strange country in\r\nwhich he had never been before. He walked up, and in the long open hall\r\nstretching the whole length of the house he saw an old man and a young\r\nand beautiful girl.\r\n\r\n“Spread out a mat, my daughter,” the old man said, “that Pulang-Gana may\r\nsit and rest after his long journey, and you can prepare some food for\r\nhim. No doubt he is hungry as well as tired.”\r\n\r\nShe spread out a mat for Pulang-Gana, and then went into the room to get\r\nready a meal for their visitor. Soon after she opened the door of the\r\nroom and asked him to come in and eat.\r\n\r\nThe old man, who seemed kind and hospitable, said to him:—\r\n\r\n“Go in and have some food. You must be hungry after your long journey.\r\nWhen you have eaten and rested we can have a talk together. I have long\r\nwished to meet you and to ask you about yourself and your brothers, and\r\nhow affairs are in your country.”\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana went into the room, and found a nice meal awaiting him. Being\r\nvery hungry, he did full justice to it.\r\n\r\nThat evening, as they sat by the fire, the old man asked him about his\r\npeople, and if they had good crops of paddy in his country. Pulang-Gana\r\nanswered that, though his brothers possessed the largest paddy-fields in\r\nthe country, he never remembered their having a really good harvest. The\r\npaddy they obtained was not sufficient to last them the whole year, and\r\nthey had to fall back on potatoes and sago for food. The old man seemed\r\ninterested in what his guest said of himself, so Pulang-Gana went on and\r\ntold him of all his circumstances,—how he lived with his six brothers\r\nand only sister, and how unkind his brothers were to him. He also told\r\nthe old man about the porcupine which did such damage to their garden,\r\nand how often he had been scolded and beaten by his brothers for not\r\nbeing able to drive away or kill the animal. He gave an account of his\r\nadventures that morning, and how, determined to kill the porcupine, he\r\nhad followed it through the underground passage under the mountain, and\r\nhad found himself in this strange country.\r\n\r\n“I have heard your story,” said the old man, “and think you are much\r\nto be pitied. Your brothers seem to have been very unkind and to have\r\ntreated you very badly. I would like you to stay with me here, and not\r\nreturn to them. I have no son, and would like you to marry my daughter\r\nand live with us. I am getting old, and am not so strong as I used to be,\r\nand will be glad of your help.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to stay with you very much, for you seem so kind, and are\r\nso different to my brothers, and I should like to marry your daughter\r\nand spend the rest of my life here. But there is no one to look after\r\nour garden, and the porcupine will do much damage to it. My brothers are\r\nsure to be angry with me for leaving them, and when they see their garden\r\ndestroyed through my neglect they are sure to hunt for me, and when they\r\nfind me they will probably kill me. No; much as I would like to stay, I\r\nam afraid I cannot. I must start to return to-morrow. It would have been\r\ndifferent if I had succeeded in killing the porcupine; then it would not\r\nmatter so much if I stayed away some time.”\r\n\r\n“You need not trouble yourself about the animal that attacks the\r\nvegetables planted in your garden. I can prevent its coming again.\r\nThat porcupine is not really an animal. One of our slaves here, named\r\nIndai-Antok-Genok, is commanded by me to transform herself into a\r\nporcupine, and pay visits to that garden. I shall tell her to do so no\r\nmore, and your brothers’ garden will be safe enough without you to watch\r\nit. You must remain here with us. There is nothing for you to fear.\r\nIf you do not return, your brothers will think that some accident has\r\nhappened to you, and that you are dead. As they are all so unkind to you,\r\nyou may be sure they will not trouble to look for you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if that be the case, I will gladly live with you. I was not happy\r\nwith my brothers, and I am sure I shall be happy here.”\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that Pulang-Gana should remain in the house of the\r\nold man. Some months afterwards he married the daughter, and they lived\r\nhappily as husband and wife. His wife’s father and mother were kind to\r\nhim, and so were the other people in the house, and Pulang-Gana was very\r\nglad he decided to cast in his lot with them.\r\n\r\nNow, this old man who treated Pulang-Gana so kindly was no ordinary\r\nmortal. His name was Rajah Shua, and he ruled the spirits who lived in\r\nthe underground caves of the earth. His wife was quite as powerful as\r\nhe. She was a goddess, and had power over the animals of the forest,\r\nall of which obeyed her. She was known as Seregendah. The daughter that\r\nmarried Pulang-Gana was called Trentom-Tanah-Tumboh, and sometimes\r\nSetanggoi-Tanggoi-Buloh.\r\n\r\nIn process of time Pulang-Gana’s wife gave birth to a girl, who was very\r\nmuch admired by all, and greatly loved by her parents.\r\n\r\nWhen the child was a few years old, she came one day to her father and\r\nmother and asked what property they intended to leave her. The mother\r\nshowed her the valuable jars and brassware that she possessed, all of\r\nwhich were to belong to her child. Then the little girl asked her father\r\nwhat he had to give her. Pulang-Gana had no property to leave to his\r\ndaughter. Years ago he had come by chance to this house of Rajah Shua,\r\nbringing nothing with him, and unless his brothers gave him a share of\r\ntheir father’s property, he would have nothing to leave his daughter. So\r\nhe told her to be content with what her mother gave her. She would be\r\nvery rich without anything from him. But she was not satisfied with this\r\nreply, and cried because her father said he had nothing to give her.\r\n\r\nWhen Pulang-Gana saw how sad his child was he said to his father-in-law\r\nthat he would like to pay a visit to his brothers, and ask them for his\r\nshare of the property, that he might have something to give his daughter.\r\nRajah Shua told him he might go to them, but warned him that probably he\r\nwould not have a kind reception, and advised him not to be away long, but\r\nto return as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana started on his journey to his old home, wondering how his\r\nbrothers would receive him after his long absence. He had no difficulty\r\nin finding his way, as his father-in-law gave him very definite\r\ninstructions about his journey. He found that his brothers had built a\r\nnew house not far from the site of the old one in which he had lived\r\nwith them years ago. The house seemed very quiet, and he learnt that\r\nnearly all the people were away on a _tuba_-fishing expedition. Only his\r\nsister-in-law, the wife of his brother Belang-Pinggang, was at home.\r\n\r\nShe was very much surprised to see him, and said they had given him\r\nup for dead long ago. She told him that the others were away fishing,\r\nand that his brother Bui-Nasi, herself, and a little boy were the only\r\nmembers of the family left at home. He would find his brother and the\r\nlittle boy working at the forge making some implements for their work.\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana said he would go to his brother, and he left the house and\r\nwalked in the direction where he guessed the forge was from the sound of\r\nhammering he heard.\r\n\r\n“Oh! is that you, Pulang-Gana?” said Bui-Nasi, as soon as he saw him.\r\n“Where have you been all these years? We thought that you had met with\r\nsome accident, and had died long ago.”\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana said little about himself to his brother. He told him how he\r\nhad lost his way in the jungle years ago, and when he arrived at last at\r\na house the people there persuaded him to stay with them, and he said\r\nthat he was now married and had a daughter.\r\n\r\n“Have you come with your wife to stay with us?” asked Bui-Nasi.\r\n\r\n“No,” was the answer; “I have only come on a short visit by myself to ask\r\nfor my share of the property left us by our father.”\r\n\r\n“You have nothing whatever to expect. You left us years ago of your own\r\nwill, and have been away all this time, and now you have the impudence to\r\ncome and ask for your share of the property. I advise you to say nothing\r\nof this to the others. They will be very vexed with you if you do.”\r\n\r\n“I do not ask for much,” said Pulang-Gana. “I will be satisfied with\r\nlittle. But my daughter asked me what I had to give her, so I came here\r\nto beg for something, and I should be sorry to return empty-handed.”\r\n\r\n“You shall not return empty-handed,” said Bui-Nasi in scorn. “Here is\r\nsomething for you to take back with you. It is all that you will get from\r\nus, I can tell you.” With these words he threw Pulang-Gana a clod of\r\nearth which he saw lying near. “Now go away, and do not let us see your\r\nface again.”\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana put the lump of earth in his bag, and with a heavy heart\r\nstarted to return to his house. So this was the way his brothers treated\r\nhim! There was nothing to expect from them!\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at his house, all the family gathered round him. They had\r\nheard that he had gone to ask his brothers for his share of the property,\r\nand they were anxious to see what he brought back. His little daughter\r\nrushed up eagerly to him and said:—\r\n\r\n“Father, what have you brought back for me from my uncles? Let me see the\r\nnice things they gave you.”\r\n\r\nThen Pulang-Gana said sadly: “I received no share of the property from\r\nyour uncles. They would have nothing to do with me, and drove me away.”\r\n\r\n“But did you get nothing at all from them?” asked his father-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Pulang-Gana; “my brother Bui-Nasi did give me something, but\r\nI am ashamed to tell you what it is. Here it is.” And he took out from\r\nhis bag the lump of earth his brother had given him, and handed it to his\r\nfather-in-law.\r\n\r\nWhen Rajah Shua saw what Pulang-Gana had received from his brothers, he\r\nsaid joyfully:—\r\n\r\n“They have given you the most valuable gift it is possible to imagine.\r\nYou are now a person of great importance. The earth is yours. Whoever\r\nwishes to plant on it must first make offerings and sacrifices to you,\r\nand pray to you to give him a good harvest. It is in your power to make\r\nthe earth fruitful or barren, and to give mankind a good or a bad harvest\r\nas you will.”\r\n\r\nA few months after, the brothers of Pulang-Gana, at the advice of\r\nBui-Nasi, decided on the site where they were to plant paddy that year.\r\nIt was a large forest some distance away from their house. First they cut\r\ndown the smaller trees, and then they felled the large trees, and when\r\nall this work was done they rested for some weeks, waiting for the sun to\r\ndry up the timber, so that it might be set on fire and the land be ready\r\nfor planting on.\r\n\r\nOne day Pulang-Gana’s father-in-law said to him: “I hear that your\r\nbrothers have been busy cutting down the trees where they intend to plant\r\npaddy this year. As they gave you the earth some time ago to be your\r\nshare of the property, it is only right that they should ask leave from\r\nyou before planting on it. Since they have not done so, you must stop\r\nthem from planting paddy there.”\r\n\r\n“How can I prevent them planting paddy where they like?” said\r\nPulang-Gana in dismay. “Is it likely that they will take any notice of\r\nanything I say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said his father-in-law, Rajah Shua; “they will have to listen to\r\nwhat you say, for I will be on your side, and will help you. I am the god\r\nthat rules the spirits that live in the underground caves of the earth,\r\nand my wife Seregendah has power over the animals and the spirits which\r\ninhabit the forests. As your brothers have treated you so unkindly, and\r\nhave given you no share of the property, and have simply given you a clod\r\nof earth to take back with you, my wife and I will punish them and reward\r\nyou by giving you power over everything that grows on the earth. Before\r\nthe land is planted, offerings must be made to you, and invocations must\r\nbe sung to yourself, and myself, and my wife Seregendah. Unless these\r\nthings be done, the ground will not be fruitful.\r\n\r\n“As your brothers have not done anything of the kind, you must teach them\r\na lesson, and prevent them from going on with their work. This evening at\r\ndusk you must go to the newly cleared forest and cry aloud: ‘Come here,\r\nall you who are the servants of Seregendah and Rajah Shua,’ and name all\r\nthe wild beasts of the forest. They will come to you in large numbers.\r\nThen you must ask them, as well as the invisible spirits, who will be\r\npresent too, to help you to put up all the trees that have been cut down.”\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana did as his father-in-law advised him. He went at dusk to the\r\npart of the jungle where his brothers had been cutting down the trees,\r\nand called to the animals in the name of Rajah Shua and of Seregendah,\r\nand they came in large numbers and helped him to put up all the trees\r\nthat had been felled, and the forest appeared just as it had been before\r\nany of the trees had been cut down.\r\n\r\nThe next day Bui-Nasi went early in the morning to see if the fish-traps\r\nhe had set in the stream had caught any fish, and as he was near the\r\npart of the forest where the trees had been cut down by his brothers and\r\nhimself not long before, he went on to see how things were getting on,\r\nand if the felled jungle was dry enough to be burnt.\r\n\r\nTo his great surprise he found all the trees standing, and no signs of\r\nthe clearing that had been made. He hurried home and told his brothers\r\nwhat he had seen, and they all returned, accompanied by their friends and\r\nfollowers, and found that what Bui-Nasi had told them was perfectly true.\r\nThey were all very much surprised, as they had never known such a thing\r\nhappen before.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if this is really the part of the forest which we cleared a few\r\nweeks ago,” said one of the brothers. “Perhaps we have mistaken the spot.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bui-Nasi in reply; “there is no mistake. Here are the\r\nwhetstones on which we sharpened our axes and hatchets; and here, too, is\r\nwhere we did our cooking for our midday meal.”\r\n\r\nThey held a consultation as to what was to be done.\r\n\r\n“This is very strange,” said Bui-Nasi. “Some enemy, who is helped by\r\npowerful spirits, is determined not to let us plant paddy here. Let us\r\ntry and find out who has made the trees that we have cut down stand\r\nupright as before. My advice is that we cut down the jungle anew, and\r\nthat some of us remain and keep watch here all night. Perhaps we may be\r\nable to catch the culprit.”\r\n\r\nSo the brothers and all their friends and followers set to work, and\r\nbefore the day was ended they had cleared afresh a large stretch of\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nTwelve men, with Bui-Nasi at their head, were set to watch, and the\r\nothers returned home, discussing among themselves what had taken place.\r\n\r\nThose that were left by the clearing had not long to wait. Soon after\r\ndusk they saw a man come, and, standing on the trunk of a large felled\r\ntree, call aloud to the animals of the forest and the invisible spirits\r\naround in the name of Rajah Shua and Seregendah to come to his help. The\r\ntwelve men crept up cautiously behind him and seized him.\r\n\r\n“We have you now,” they said as they held him fast. “It is you who have\r\ncaused us all the trouble of having to cut down this jungle for the\r\nsecond time. Now we intend to kill you, and you will not be able to play\r\nyour tricks on us any more.”\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to see who it was, and Bui-Nasi said: “Let us have a\r\nlight and see what he is like. I am sure he must be as ugly as he is\r\ntroublesome.”\r\n\r\nOne of them fetched a light, and to their great surprise they saw their\r\nprisoner was Pulang-Gana!\r\n\r\n“So it is you, Pulang-Gana!” said his brother in anger. “You are up to\r\nyour old tricks again. You were too lazy to work before, and would not\r\nkeep watch over our garden, and you left us without telling us where you\r\nwere going. And now, after several years’ absence, you come back and\r\ndisturb us in our work, and by some means or other set up the trees we\r\nhave had the trouble of cutting down. Though I am your brother, I have\r\nno pity for you. As long as you are alive you will give us trouble, so we\r\nintend to kill you and be well rid of you.”\r\n\r\nHe expected Pulang-Gana to be afraid of him, and to plead for his life.\r\nBut things were very much changed from the old days, when Pulang-Gana was\r\nthe despised youngest brother, beaten and scolded by the others. Now he\r\nwas the son-in-law of the gods, and had Rajah Shua and Seregendah to help\r\nhim, and he was not at all afraid of his brothers, because he knew well\r\nthey could do him no harm.\r\n\r\nHe shook off those that held him, and told them to listen to what he had\r\nto say. His manner and bearing were very different from that of one who\r\nfeared them. They stood around him in awe, for they instinctively felt\r\nthat Pulang-Gana was not to be trifled with, and from what had already\r\ntaken place they knew that he was aided by powerful spirits.\r\n\r\nThen Pulang-Gana spoke:—\r\n\r\n“I have good reason for doing what I did. You have no right to cut down\r\nthis jungle or to plant on this land. You have not asked my leave to\r\ndo so, and have not paid me the price of the land. Not long ago, you,\r\nBui-Nasi, gave me a clod of earth as my share of the property of our\r\nfather, and so I have now the right of preventing any from planting on\r\nthe earth. It is no use you attempting to kill me. Though you are many in\r\nnumbers, it is impossible for you to kill me, because I am now the god of\r\nthe earth, and am assisted by Rajah Shua and Seregendah, whose power you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a short time, and then Bui-Nasi said:—\r\n\r\n“No doubt what you say is true, for no one without supernatural aid\r\ncould have made the trees that were cut down stand upright and grow. What\r\ndo you wish us to do, and how are we to obtain your leave to plant on the\r\nland?”\r\n\r\nPulang-Gana told them to gather all the people together the next day, and\r\nhe would tell them what they must do in order to insure their getting\r\ngood crops of paddy.\r\n\r\nThat same night messengers were sent in all directions to tell the people\r\nin the neighbouring villages to come together the next day, in order that\r\nthey might learn from Pulang-Gana what they were to do before cutting\r\ndown the jungle and planting paddy.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a very large crowd gathered together, and Pulang-Gana\r\nsaid to them:\r\n\r\n“You must always remember that I am the god of the earth, and before\r\ncutting down the jungle for planting you must make invocations to me, as\r\nwell as to Rajah Shua and Seregendah, and you must ask me for permission\r\nto plant on the piece of land you have chosen. You must also kill some\r\nanimal—a pig or a fowl—and offer it as a sacrifice to me, and in addition\r\nto this some offering of food—rice, or eggs, or potatoes, or fruit—must\r\nbe made. Then, lastly, you must remember to bury some small offering in\r\nthe ground. That is the rent you pay me for the use of the land, for all\r\nthe land belongs to me, and I expect rent to be paid by all who use it.\r\n\r\n“And if anything goes wrong in your paddy-fields, and the crops are poor,\r\nor, being good, are attacked by insects or wild animals, then you must\r\ncall upon Rajah Shua and Seregendah and myself to come to your aid, and\r\nwe will help you.”\r\n\r\nThen for the first time did the new ceremonies come into force, and,\r\naided by the higher powers, men were able to obtain much better crops\r\nthan they had done before. And this is why no Dyak dares to plant paddy\r\nwithout first burying some small gift in the earth, and also making\r\ninvocations and offerings to Pulang-Gana, Rajah Shua, and Seregendah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOME CURIOUS CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n    Trial by ordeal—Diving contests—A diving contest\r\n    in Krian—A Dyak superstition—Names—Fruit found\r\n    by the pathway—Circumcision—Fishing and hunting\r\n    superstition—Madness—Leprosy—Time—Form of greeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of referring disputed questions to supernatural decision\r\nis not unknown to the Dyaks. They have the trial by ordeal, and believe\r\nthat the gods are sure to help the innocent and punish the guilty. I\r\nhave heard of several different methods, which are seldom resorted to\r\nnowadays. The only ordeal that I have frequently seen among the Dyaks\r\nis the Ordeal by Diving. When there is a dispute between two parties in\r\nwhich it is impossible to get any reliable evidence, or where one of the\r\nparties is not satisfied with the decision of the headman of the Dyak\r\nhouse, the Diving Ordeal is often resorted to.\r\n\r\nSeveral preliminary meetings are held by the representatives of both\r\nparties to determine the time and place of the match. It is also decided\r\nwhat property each party should stake. This has to be paid by the loser\r\nto the victor. The various articles staked are brought out of the room,\r\nand placed in the public hall of the house in which each litigant lives,\r\nand there they are covered up and secured.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks look upon a Diving Ordeal as a sacred rite, and for several\r\ndays and nights before the contest they gather their friends together,\r\nand make offerings and sing incantations to the spirits, and beg of them\r\nto vindicate the just and cause their representative to win. Each party\r\nchooses a champion. There are many professional divers who for a trifling\r\nsum are willing to undergo the painful contest.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the day previous to that on which the diving match is\r\nto take place each champion is fed with seven compressed balls of cooked\r\nrice. Then each is made to lie down on a fine mat, and is covered with\r\nthe best Dyak woven sheet they have; an incantation is made over him, and\r\nthe spirit inhabitants of the waters are invoked to come to the aid of\r\nthe man whose cause is just.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning the champions are roused from their sleep, and\r\ndressed each in a fine new waist-cloth. The articles staked are brought\r\ndown from the houses and placed upon the bank. A large crowd of men,\r\nwomen, and children join the procession of the two champions and their\r\nfriends and supporters to the scene of the contest at the riverside. As\r\nsoon as the place is reached, fires are lit and mats are spread for the\r\ndivers to sit on and warm themselves. While they sit by their respective\r\nfires, the necessary arrangements are made.\r\n\r\nEach party provides a roughly-constructed wooden grating to be placed in\r\nthe bed of the river for his champion to stand on in the water. These are\r\nplaced within a few yards of each other, where the water is deep enough\r\nto reach the waist, and near each a pole is thrust firmly in the mud for\r\nthe man to hold on to when he is diving.\r\n\r\nThe two men are led out into the river, and each stands on his own\r\ngrating grasping his pole. At a given signal they plunge their heads\r\nsimultaneously into the water. Immediately the spectators shout aloud\r\nat the top of their voices, over and over again, “_Lobon—lobon_,” and\r\ncontinue doing so during the whole contest. What these mysterious words\r\nmean, I have never been able to discover. When at length one of the\r\nchampions shows signs of yielding, by his movements in the water and the\r\nshaking of the pole he is holding to, the excitement becomes very great.\r\n“_Lobon—lobon_,” is shouted louder and more rapidly than before. The\r\nshouts become deafening. The struggles of the poor victim who is fast\r\nbecoming asphyxiated are painful to witness. The champions are generally\r\nplucky, and seldom come out of the water of their own will. They stay\r\nunder water until the loser drops senseless, and is dragged ashore\r\napparently lifeless by his companions. The friends of his opponent,\r\nraising a loud shout of triumph, hurry to the bank, and seize and carry\r\noff the stakes. The vanquished one, quite unconscious, is carried by his\r\nfriends to the fire. In a few minutes he recovers, opens his eyes and\r\ngazes wildly around, and in a short time is able to walk slowly home.\r\nNext day he is probably in high fever from the effects of his dive. When\r\nboth champions succumb at the same time, the one who first regains his\r\nsenses is held to be the winner.\r\n\r\nI have timed several diving contests, and where the divers are good they\r\nkeep under water between three and four minutes.\r\n\r\nAmong some tribes of Dyaks, the champion is paid his fee whether he wins\r\nor loses. They say it is not the fault of the diver, but because his side\r\nis in the wrong, that he is beaten. Among other tribes, however, no fee\r\nis given to the losing champion, so he comes off very poorly indeed.\r\n\r\nThere are certain cases where diving seems to be the only means of a\r\nsatisfactory decision. Take the case of the ownership of a _durian_\r\ntree. The tree probably does not bear fruit till fifteen years after it\r\nhas been planted. Up to that time no one pays any attention to it. When\r\nthe tree begins to bear fruit two or three lay claim to it. The man who\r\noriginally planted it is probably dead, and no one knows for certain whom\r\nthe tree belongs to. In a case like this, no amount of discussion can\r\nlead to a satisfactory decision, whereas a diving contest settles the\r\nmatter to the satisfaction of all parties.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks have great faith in the Diving Ordeal, and believe that the\r\ngods will always maintain right by making the man who is in the wrong be\r\nthe loser. In fact, if a Dyak refuses the challenge of a Diving Ordeal,\r\nit is equivalent to his admitting that he is in the wrong.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dyaks of the Batang Lupar diving contests are frequent.\r\nChampions are poorly paid for diving, and the losing diver receives\r\nnothing at all. Little or nothing is staked, and there is not much\r\nattached to the winning or losing of a case except the property in\r\ndispute. If the diving contest be about a fruit-tree, the winner becomes\r\nthe owner of the tree, and the loser is not allowed to make any further\r\nclaim. In the villages on the Krian River, however, the ordeal by diving\r\nis rarely resorted to, and when a diving contest does take place, the\r\nstakes are very high indeed.\r\n\r\nA remarkable dispute was decided in Krian many years ago. I was told of\r\nit by the son of the man who won the case. A girl put out in the sun a\r\npetticoat she had woven. It was stolen. Some months after she saw a girl\r\nwearing it, and recognized it as her petticoat. She accused the girl of\r\nstealing it. The girl declared it was her own, and denied the theft. Both\r\ngirls belonged to good families. It was decided to resort to the ordeal\r\nby diving. The stakes were very high. It was agreed that the losing party\r\nshould give to the other eight valuable jars.\r\n\r\nEach party chose a good champion, and the fee paid him was very high. On\r\nthe day of the contest a very large crowd from far and near came together\r\nto witness it.\r\n\r\nThe losing party paid to the victors the eight valuable jars as promised,\r\nand were reduced to poverty by doing so.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks have a curious superstition that if food is offered to a man,\r\nand he refuses it, and goes away without at least touching it, some\r\nmisfortune is sure to befall him. It is said that he is sure to be either\r\nattacked by a crocodile, or bitten by a snake, or suffer from the attack\r\nof some animal.\r\n\r\nWhen Dyaks have been asked to stay and have a meal, if they do not feel\r\ninclined to do so, I have often noticed them touch the food before going\r\naway. They say it would be _puni_ not to do so. I have never been able to\r\ndiscover the reason for this curious superstition, but innumerable tales\r\nare told of those who have disregarded it, and have paid the penalty by\r\nbeing attacked by some animal.\r\n\r\nA curious custom prevails among the Dyaks with regard to names. Parents\r\nare no longer known by their names, but as the father or mother of\r\nSo-and-so. For instance, if the child is born, and named Janting, the\r\nfather would no longer be known by his own name, but would be called\r\n_Apai Janting_ (the father of Janting) and the mother _Indai Janting_\r\n(the mother of Janting).\r\n\r\nThe names of children are often changed because the Dyaks have a great\r\ndislike of mentioning the name of anyone who is dead. So when a man dies,\r\nit is usual for his namesakes in his village to have new names given them.\r\n\r\nIt is considered a terrible crime to mention the name of the\r\nfather-in-law or mother-in-law. Though a Dyak does not speak of his\r\nfather and mother by name, still if he were asked their names, he would\r\ngive them. But if a man were asked the name of his father-in-law or\r\nmother-in-law, he would not tell it, but ask some other person present to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks will eat fruit that has fallen from any tree, but if they find\r\nfruit by the path, they will never touch it. The reason for this is given\r\nin the Dyak legend, “Danjai and the Were-Tiger’s Sister” (p. 265).\r\n\r\nI remember once walking with some Dyaks, and a man carrying a load of\r\nfruit passed us. Farther on we saw some fruit which had evidently dropped\r\nfrom his load, but none of the Dyaks would eat it.\r\n\r\nCircumcision is practised among certain Dyak tribes. It is not a\r\nreligious ceremony, and is not accompanied with the offering of\r\nsacrifices or the singing of incantations. All I have been able to learn\r\nfrom such tribes as practise it, is that it has been the custom from\r\nancient days, and so they do it. The cutting of the foreskin is not done\r\nwith a knife, but with a piece of sharpened bamboo. The custom is by no\r\nmeans universal among the Sea Dyaks.\r\n\r\nWhen going out fishing or hunting it is considered most unfortunate to\r\nmention the name of any fish or bird, or to talk of any animal which it\r\nis hoped to secure. One evening I was out shooting wild pig, and was\r\nsitting in a dug-out, which was paddled up a stream by three Dyaks. I\r\nsaid in fun: “There will be plenty of room to put a pig here behind me\r\nif we manage to shoot one.” The Dyaks all looked horrified, and I was\r\ntold that saying such a thing as that meant with them the certainty of\r\nfailure. As it happened, we succeeded in killing a wild pig, and brought\r\nit back that evening in the boat. There was much discussion among the\r\npeople in the Dyak house, and they were surprised at our success after\r\nwhat I had said.\r\n\r\nMadness is looked upon by the Dyaks as possession by some evil spirit.\r\nAll they can do for it is to call the witch-doctors in to sing their\r\nincantations, and exorcise the evil spirit. If no good result follows,\r\nand the man is still a violent lunatic, a large wooden cage (_bubong_)\r\nis made, and the man is kept in it. This is only done in the case of\r\ndangerous and violent madmen. Harmless lunatics and idiots are allowed\r\ntheir freedom.\r\n\r\nLeprosy is not unknown among the Dyaks, and occasionally cases of it\r\nare met with. There used to be a village in the Krian where there were\r\nseveral suffering from leprosy. When the disease is so far advanced as\r\nto make it unsafe to let them live with others in the long Dyak house, a\r\nseparate little hut is put up for them at some distance away. I remember\r\nseeing a poor woman who lived by herself in this way. The people from\r\nthe house would often go and see her, and take her food and water, but\r\nsometimes she would be left for days. She told me that once her fire went\r\nout, and as no one came to see her for two days, she was unable to cook\r\nany food, and had to live as best she could during that time. It must\r\nhave been a lonely, unhappy life she led, and one can imagine such an one\r\nlonging for death to end her troubles.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks mark the time by the position of the sun. A man will tell you\r\nat what hour you may expect him by saying something of this kind, “I\r\nshall come to-morrow when the sun is there,” pointing to the part of the\r\nsky where the sun will be.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of greeting when Dyaks meet is, “_Kini ka nuan?_” (“Where\r\nare you going?”), or, “_Ari ni nuan?_” (“Where have you come from?”).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF THE SEA DYAK IN SARAWAK\r\n\r\n    The Sea Dyak—Work—Bad times—Cheerfulness—The view\r\n    from within—The Sea Dyak’s future—Mission work among\r\n    them—Government—Development in the immediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are occasions when one who has lived among a people like the Dyaks,\r\nand has learnt to know and to love them, looks forward into the coming\r\nyears and tries to picture what is in store for them. Those who have\r\nread the preceding pages will be able to form some idea of the Dyaks\r\nas they are, and know their manner of life, and to a certain extent, I\r\nhope, their modes of thought. In this chapter I shall say something of\r\nthe probable future of the Sea Dyak in Sarawak. Let me first recall some\r\nfeatures of the home life of the average Dyak at the present day.\r\n\r\nHe marries at an early age, and lives in a long Dyak village house with\r\nhis wife and children. His wife since her marriage has grown into a\r\ntired-looking, untidy woman, very different from the bright merry girl\r\nof ten years ago. How can she help it? She has four children to look\r\nafter, and the youngest is still an infant, who needs a great deal of her\r\nattention. She has to fetch the water required, and do the cooking for\r\nthe family. She has to attend to the drying and pounding of the paddy,\r\nand convert it into the rice for their daily food. In addition to all\r\nthis, there is the worry and commotion connected with having to move the\r\nhousehold for some months each year to the little hut put up in their\r\npaddy-farm some little distance away.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyak has year after year to grow as much paddy as possible. He\r\nrises on work-days early in the morning, partakes of his frugal meal of\r\nrice and salt, or rice and salt fish, varied, if he be very lucky, by a\r\npiece of wild pig’s flesh or venison, which he has received as a gift or\r\nbought from some hunting friend. His wife bundles up for him his midday\r\nmeal in the spathe of the Penang palm, and he goes off to his work,\r\nreturning home late in the evening.\r\n\r\nThere are days when he does not go to work on his paddy-farm, but spends\r\nhis time in getting firewood or mending things in his room, or in sitting\r\nabout in the common veranda chatting with his friends.\r\n\r\nWhen the paddy has grown a little, and the time for weeding draws near,\r\nthe family remove to the little hut put up in the paddy-field. In the\r\nweeding the Sea Dyak is helped by his wife, the younger children being\r\nleft in charge of the elder for the greater part of the day, while their\r\nparents are at work. When the weeding has been done, the family return to\r\nthe long Dyak house for a month or so; then they go back to their hut to\r\nwatch the ripening paddy and guard it against attacks of birds and beasts.\r\n\r\nPaddy-planting is the chief occupation of every Sea Dyak, but he has\r\nplenty of time for other things, and his life is not quite so monotonous\r\nas may be supposed. The actual work of paddy-planting, and things\r\nconnected with it, such as the building of farm-huts and the getting\r\nready of farming implements, takes up seven or perhaps eight months of\r\nthe year. The Sea Dyak has, therefore, a certain amount of time during\r\nwhich he can visit his friends, make boats, or hunt for jungle produce.\r\n\r\nOn certain occasions the Sea Dyaks muster in great force. At a feast a\r\nlarge number of them appear dressed in such finery as they possess, and\r\nthey eat more than is good for them, and drink enough bad Dyak _tuak_\r\n(spirit) to make them very sick and to give them a bad headache for the\r\nnext few days. At a large _tuba_-fishing crowds of them congregate with\r\ntheir hand-nets and fish-spears, and a pleasant sort of picnic is spent,\r\nattended, if they are fortunate, with the procuring of much fish.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Dyak has his bad times. When he has had a bad crop, he has to\r\nthink of some means of raising money—not for luxuries in dress and food,\r\nbut for the plain necessaries of rice and salt upon which many Dyaks have\r\nto live for several months in the year. On these occasions he will work\r\nfor some Chinaman at the nearest bazaar for a low wage, or sell firewood\r\nto them for whatever they will give. If he possess such things, he sells\r\nsome old brass gun or gong to buy food for his family. If he be reduced\r\nto borrowing paddy from his neighbours, he will have to pay back the\r\nfollowing year double the amount he has received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DYAK IN GALA COSTUME\r\n\r\nHe has a fringed headkerchief, in which are fixed feathers of the\r\nrhinoceros hornbill, and other birds. His ears are decorated with lead\r\npendants. Round his neck are necklaces of beads, and brass or silver\r\nbuttons. He has shell bracelets and brass and cane rings on his arms,\r\nand a large number of palm fibre rings on his wrists. Round his waist\r\nis a belt of silver coins, and his sword is fastened to his side. He is\r\nwearing the Dyak waistcloth and has a _sarong_ on his right shoulder.\r\nThis is the usual dress worn by a Dyak at a feast.]\r\n\r\nBelow the class of industrious workers whom I have tried to depict, there\r\nis a lower stratum consisting of the failures. These are the lazy Dyaks,\r\nthe poor workers, who have never by any possible chance enough paddy at\r\nthe harvest to last them through the year; who live perpetually in an\r\natmosphere of debt; who eke out their livelihood by selling wild-ferns\r\nand bamboo-shoots for the trifling payment in paddy that people will\r\ngive for such things; who live a hugger-mugger life, depending a good\r\ndeal on the charity of their neighbours. Of this class I say nothing.\r\nIt is not numerous, and does not come within the scope of this chapter.\r\nAnother class which I pass over consists of the few rich men, whose\r\nwealth is continually increasing, who sell paddy year after year, and,\r\nwhen there is more work than they can conveniently do, can always afford\r\nto get extra labour by paying for it. The class I am dealing with is\r\nneither rich nor poor, and is to be met with in large numbers in any Dyak\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak is cheerful and contented with his life. If his lot is a hard\r\nand uneventful one, he is ignorant of any other, and is quite satisfied\r\nwith it. He knows little of the outside world. He reads no books or\r\nnewspapers. The scope of his conversation is limited to matters of\r\nfarming or of boat-building, varied perhaps by some local Dyak scandal,\r\nor some experience he may have gone through when, in his younger days,\r\nbefore he settled down as a sober married man, he went out gutta-hunting\r\nin distant lands. He has no wish to improve himself. His father and\r\ngrandfather lived in long Dyak houses, and what was good enough for them\r\nis good enough for him. Why should he worry himself about building better\r\nhouses, or farming in some new and improved way? He will not meddle with\r\nmatters that are too high for him; and yet, notwithstanding this calm and\r\neven existence that he leads from childhood to the grave, those who are\r\nmost interested in the Sea Dyak must feel that his life is not what it\r\nought to be, that it shows few signs of progress, and is too stagnant to\r\nbe healthy.\r\n\r\nThey do not suppose him to be a “fortuitous aggregation of atoms that\r\nwill shortly be dispersed throughout space.” They believe that there is\r\nsomething Divine in him holding those fleeting atoms together, and making\r\nthem one, and that he is journeying through a world of tragic meaning to\r\nthe significance of which he seems to be for ever blind. They long to see\r\nhim brought under the elevating and purifying influence of Christianity.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked: What are the Missions, Church of England and Roman\r\nCatholic, doing to elevate the Sea Dyak? I believe they are doing the\r\nbest they can, but there are many things to contend against. First, there\r\nis the natural inability of the Dyak to keep his attention fixed upon\r\none subject for any length of time, and so it is difficult to prevent\r\nthe conversation from drifting into some commonplace topic when one is\r\ntalking about serious matters. Then, again, when are they to be taught?\r\nThey usually come home from their work late in the evening, and then\r\nthey are tired, and take no interest in anything, being greatly in need\r\nof rest. It is at all times difficult to have a quiet conversation in a\r\nDyak house. The common veranda is suitable for many things, but it is far\r\ntoo noisy to be convenient for teaching. They are often away from their\r\nhomes for months, and the Missionary, who generally has a large field to\r\ncover, finds he cannot visit many villages in his parish more than once\r\nin three months. How much of such teaching is likely to be remembered? Of\r\ncourse, things are better where the Church and Mission House are. There\r\nregular services are held, and these the Sea Dyak has the opportunity of\r\nattending. He can also come up to the Mission House and talk over matters\r\nwith the Missionary in charge, or the Schoolmaster, or the Catechist. But\r\nthe number of Mission Houses with resident Missionaries among the large\r\nand scattered population of Sea Dyaks in Sarawak is but small.\r\n\r\nThe up-country Mission Schools, which the Government liberally support,\r\nadmit boys at an early age, when they are most susceptible to the\r\nreception of new ideas. Here they are away from Dyak surroundings, and\r\nlive with the Missionary and Schoolmaster. One naturally hopes that\r\neach of these boys returning to his family will be an example to them,\r\nleading them into the right way, and no doubt the old schoolboys have an\r\ninfluence for good, in more ways than one, on the homes to which they\r\nreturn. There are, indeed, among the Christian Sea Dyaks of Sarawak\r\nsome striking examples of an intelligent reception of the truth, and\r\nof a faith which is a living personal force governing their lives.\r\nBut, unhappily, these cases are few as compared with the bulk of the\r\npopulation, and the people live such an unsettled life that missionary\r\neffort, as it exists in Sarawak at the present time, can but touch a\r\nsmall proportion of them, and, unless greatly reinforced, cannot affect,\r\nto any very considerable extent, the future of the Sea Dyak.\r\n\r\nThe Government, by maintaining discipline in the different districts,\r\nby punishing crime and regulating trade, is no doubt instilling into\r\nthe mind of the people important principles of law and order, and it\r\nhas suppressed the atrocious crimes of piracy and head-hunting. The\r\nimportation of Hakka Chinese to show the Dyaks how paddy ought to be\r\nplanted is an important move in the right direction, and will conduce to\r\ntheir prosperity if only they can be persuaded to submit to instruction.\r\nBut the future of the Sea Dyak even as regards material well-being is\r\nsomewhat doubtful. There are those who say that he is slowly, but none\r\nthe less surely, improving, and that he will at no very distant time\r\nreach the stage of progress to which most of the Malays in the country\r\nhave attained; that his means of earning a livelihood then will not be\r\nconfined to paddy-planting and occasionally working jungle produce, but\r\nthat he will work sago, and also engage in fishing and boat-building on\r\na large scale. Others, however, mutter dark things concerning the Sea\r\nDyak’s primitive methods of farming and his unwillingness to give them\r\nup, and they paint a dismal picture of villages crowded in the distant\r\nfuture by half-starved men and women, living on worn-out land which will\r\nnot bear abundant crops, as in the old days, a weakly and sickly race,\r\ndebilitated by insufficiency of food.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the ultimate fate of the Sea Dyak, that events will move\r\non certain lines in the immediate future seems to be fairly probable. The\r\nSea Dyak will go on living in the same kind of house as his ancestors\r\nhad—much the same kind of life year after year. He will go on farming in\r\nhis present primitive way till the soil around is worn out; then he will\r\nask leave of the Government, as has been done in many cases lately, to\r\nremove to some new and uncultivated country, and to be allowed to cut\r\ndown the jungle on the hills there. Enormous tracts of lowland jungle\r\nexist in the lower reaches of the rivers on whose banks the Sea Dyaks\r\nlive; but though they are industrious enough to plant their paddy on\r\nswampy soil which was cleared of jungle generations ago, they do not seem\r\nto care to cut down lowland jungle and prepare such land for planting.\r\nNo doubt the reason is that it is harder work, and that after the trees\r\nare felled, it is six or seven years before the roots have rotted, and\r\nthe soil has settled, and the land is fit for planting paddy on. What\r\nthe Sea Dyaks like is to be allowed to remove to some country with plenty\r\nof wooded hills. They prefer planting paddy on the hills to clearing the\r\nlowland jungle, and waiting till the swampy land is fit for planting. The\r\nold sequence of events will repeat itself. The new land, rich virgin soil\r\nat first, will, under his devastating hand, soon become exhausted and\r\nworn out. It does not take long to impoverish land if no attempt is made\r\nto enrich it.\r\n\r\nThat these melancholy forebodings may never be fulfilled must be the\r\nearnest wish of all who have in some way or other come into contact with\r\nthe Sea Dyak—a warm-hearted, hospitable, cheery figure, satisfied with\r\nlittle, living in the present, with no thought of the future, quite\r\ncontent if he have food to eat and tobacco to smoke, and yet, for this\r\nvery reason, because he is so satisfied with his lot, most unwilling to\r\nadmit new ideas, seemingly for ever unconscious of the significance of\r\nhis life, and ignorant of the infinite possibilities for good or evil\r\nwhich exist in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground” (Gen. ii. 7).\r\nIn this respect Dyak tradition corresponds with the Biblical account.\r\n\r\n[2] Rice in the husk.\r\n\r\n[3] _Pinang_, betel-nut.\r\n\r\n[4] _Sireh_, a kind of pepper-leaf which the Dyaks are fond of eating\r\nwith betel-nut.\r\n\r\n[5] The Dyaks are fond of rhyming names, which often have no special\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF DYAK WORDS AND PHRASES\r\n\r\nWHICH OCCUR IN THE FOREGOING PAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n=Achar=, a spoon-bait.\r\n\r\n=Akal plandok=, the cunning of the _plandok_ or mouse-deer.\r\n\r\n=Anggat=, a term of endearment used in addressing a boy.\r\n\r\n=Antu=, a spirit; the dead.\r\n\r\n=Ari ni nuan?= “From whence are you (come)?” A form of greeting.\r\n\r\n=Attap=, a leaf roof made from the leaves of the _nipa_ palm.\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\n=Baiya=, goods put aside upon the owner’s death and placed upon or within\r\nhis grave.\r\n\r\n=Banghong=, a Dyak boat.\r\n\r\n=Baru=, a tree with fibrous bark.\r\n\r\n=Batu=, a stone.\r\n\r\n=Batu bintang=, “star stone.”\r\n\r\n=Batu ilau=, “stone of light.”\r\n\r\n=Batu krang jiranau=, the petrified section of _jiranau_ (Zingeberad?).\r\n\r\n=Batu krat ikan sembilan=, the petrified section of the _sembilan_ fish.\r\n\r\n=Batu kudi=, “stones of wrath.”\r\n\r\n=Batu lintar=, thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n=Batu nitar=, thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n=Bebaju besi=, “wearing an iron coat.” Name of a _manang_ ceremony.\r\n\r\n=Bebandong api=, “displaying fire.” Name of a _manang_ ceremony.\r\n\r\n=Bebayak=, making a _bayak_ or iguana.
