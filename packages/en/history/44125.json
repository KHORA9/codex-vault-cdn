S.\r\n\r\n   IN GRATITUDE FOR MUCH PATIENT HELP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first English translation of the complete works of Polybius\r\nas far as they are now known. In attempting such a task I feel that I\r\nought to state distinctly the limits which I have proposed to myself\r\nin carrying it out. I have desired to present to English readers a\r\nfaithful copy of what Polybius wrote, which should at the same time\r\nbe a readable English book. I have not been careful to follow the\r\nGreek idiom; and have not hesitated to break up and curtail or enlarge\r\nhis sentences, when I thought that, by doing so, I could present his\r\nmeaning in more idiomatic English. Polybius is not an author likely\r\nto be studied for the sake of his Greek, except by a few technical\r\nscholars; and the modern complexion of much of his thought makes\r\nsuch a plan of translation both possible and desirable. How far I\r\nhave succeeded I must leave my readers to decide. Again, I have not\r\nundertaken to write a commentary on Polybius, nor to discuss at length\r\nthe many questions of interest which arise from his text. Such an\r\nundertaking would have required much more space than I was able to\r\ngive: and happily, while my translation was passing through the press,\r\ntwo books have appeared, which will supply English students with much\r\nthat I might have felt bound to endeavour to give—the Achaean league\r\nby Mr. Capes, and the sumptuous Oxford edition of extracts by Mr.\r\nStrachan-Davidson.\r\n\r\nThe translation is made from the text of Hultsch and follows his\r\narrangement of the fragments. If this causes some inconvenience to\r\nthose who use the older texts, I hope that such inconvenience will\r\nbe minimised by the full index which I have placed at the end of the\r\nsecond volume.\r\n\r\nI have not, I repeat, undertaken to write a commentary. I propose\r\nrather to give the materials for commentary to those who, for various\r\nreasons, do not care to use the Greek of Polybius. I have therefore in\r\nthe first five complete books left him to speak for himself, with the\r\nminimum of notes which seemed necessary for the understanding of his\r\ntext. The case of the fragments was different. In giving a translation\r\nof them I have tried, when possible, to indicate the part of the\r\nhistory to which they belong, and to connect them by brief sketches of\r\nintermediate events, with full references to those authors who supply\r\nthe missing links.\r\n\r\nImperfect as the performance of such a task must, I fear, be, it has\r\nbeen one of no ordinary labour, and has occupied every hour that\r\ncould be spared during several years of a not unlaborious life. And\r\nthough I cannot hope to have escaped errors, either of ignorance or\r\nhuman infirmity, I trust that I may have produced what will be found\r\nof use to some historical students, in giving them a fairly faithful\r\nrepresentation of the works of an historian who is, in fact, our sole\r\nauthority for some most interesting portions of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nIt remains to give a brief account of the gradual formation of the text\r\nof Polybius, as we now have it.\r\n\r\nThe revival of interest in the study of Polybius was due to Pope\r\nNicholas V (1447-1455), the founder of the Vatican Library. Soon after\r\nhis election he seems to have urged Cardinal Perotti to undertake a\r\nLatin translation of the five books then known to exist. When Perotti\r\nsent him his translation of the first book, the Pope thus acknowledges\r\nit in a letter dated 28th August 1452:—[1]\r\n\r\n   “_Primus Polybii liber, quem ad nos misisti, nuper a te de Graeca\r\n   in Latinam translatus, gratissimus etiam fuit et jucundissimus:\r\n   quippe in ea translatione nobis cumulatissime satisfacis. Tanta\r\n   enim facilitate et eloquentia transfers, ut Historia ipsa nunquam\r\n   Graeca, sed prorsus Latina semper fuisse videatur. Optimum igitur\r\n   ingenium tuum valde commendamus atque probamus, teque hortamur ut\r\n   velis pro laude et gloria tua, et pro voluptate nimia singulare\r\n   opus inchoatum perficere, nec labori parcas. Nam et rem ingenio\r\n   et doctrina tua dignam, et nobis omnium gratissimam efficies; qui\r\n   laborum et studiorum tuorum aliquando memores erimus.... Tu vero,\r\n   si nobis rem gratam efficere cupis, nihil negligentiae committas\r\n   in hoc opere traducendo. Nihil enim nobis gratius efficere\r\n   poteris. Librum primum a vertice ad calcem legimus, in cujus\r\n   translatione voluntati nostrae amplissime satisfactum est._”\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January 1454 the Pope writes again to Perotti thanking him\r\nfor the third book; and in a letter to Torelli, dated 13th November\r\n1453, Perotti says that he had finished his translation of Polybius in\r\nthe preceding September. This translation was first printed in 1473.\r\nThe Greek text was not printed till 1530, when an edition of the first\r\nfive books in Greek, along with Perotti’s translation, was published at\r\nthe Hague, _opera Vincentii Obsopaei_, dedicated to George, Marquess of\r\nBrandenburg. Perotti’s translation was again printed at Basle in 1549,\r\naccompanied by a Latin translation of the fragments of books 6 to 17 by\r\nWolfgan Musculus, and reprinted at the Hague in 1598.\r\n\r\nThe chief fragments of Polybius fall into two classes; (1) those\r\nmade by some unknown epitomator, who Casaubon even supposed might be\r\nMarcus Brutus, who, according to Plutarch, was engaged in this work\r\nin his tent the night before the battle of Pharsalus. The printing of\r\nthese began with two insignificant fragments on the battle between\r\nthe Rhodians and Attalus against Philip, Paris, 1536; and another _de\r\nre navali_, Basle, 1537. These fragments have continually accumulated\r\nby fresh discoveries. (2) The other class of fragments are those\r\nmade by the order of Constantinus Porphyrogenitus (911-959), among\r\nsimilar ones from other historians, which were to be digested under\r\nfifty-three heads or tituli; one of which (the 27th) has come down\r\nto us, discovered in the sixteenth century, containing the _selecta\r\nde legationibus_; and another (the 50th) _de virtute et vitio_. The\r\nprinting of the first of these begins with the edition of Fulvius\r\nUrsinus, published at Antwerp in 1582. This was supplemented in\r\n1634 (Paris) by an edition by Valesius of _excerpta ex collectaneis\r\nConstantini Augusti Porphyrogeneti_. The first edition of something\r\nlike a complete text of Polybius, containing the five entire books,\r\nthe _excerptae legationes_, and fragments of the other books, was\r\nthat of Isaac Casaubon, Paris, 1609, fo. It was accompanied by a new\r\nand very brilliant Latin translation, and a preface which has been\r\nfamous among such works. It contains also a Latin translation of\r\nAeneas Tacticus. Altogether it is a splendid book. Some additional\r\n_annotationes_ of Casaubon’s were published after his death in 1617,\r\nParis.[2] Other editions followed; that of Gronovius, Amsterdam, 1670:\r\nof Ernesti, Leipsic, 1764, containing Casaubon’s translation more or\r\nless emended, and additional fragments. But the next important step\r\nin the bibliography of Polybius was the publication of the great\r\nedition of Schweighaeuser, Leipsic, 1789-1795, in nine volumes, with\r\na new Latin translation,—founded, however, to a great extent on\r\nCasaubon,—a new recension of the text, and still farther additions\r\nto the fragments; accompanied also by an excellent Lexicon and\r\nOnomasticon. This great work has been the foundation from which all\r\nmodern commentaries on Polybius must spring. Considerable additions\r\nto the fragments, collected from MSS. in the Vatican by Cardinal Mai,\r\nwere published in 1827 at Rome. The chief modern texts are those of\r\nBekker, 1844; Duebner (with Latin translation), 1839 and 1865; Dindorf,\r\n1866-1868, 1882 (Teubner). A new recension of the five books and all\r\nthe known fragments—founded on a collation of some twelve MSS. and all\r\nprevious editions, as well as all the numerous works of importance on\r\nour Author that have appeared in Germany and elsewhere—was published\r\nby F. Hultsch, Berlin, 1867-1872, in four volumes. This must now be\r\nconsidered the standard text. A second edition of the first volume\r\nappeared in 1888, but after that part of my translation had passed\r\nthrough the press.\r\n\r\nOf English translations the earliest was by Ch. Watson, 1568, of the\r\nfirst five books. It is entitled _The Hystories of the most famous\r\nCronographer Polybios; Discoursing of the warres betwixt the Romanes\r\nand Carthaginenses, a rich and goodly work, conteining holsome counsels\r\nand wonderful devices against the inconstances of fickle Fortune.\r\nEnglished by C[hristopher] W[atson] whereunto is annexed an Abstract,\r\ncompendiously coarcted out of the life and worthy Acts perpetrate\r\nby oure puissant Prince King Henry the fift. London, Imprinted by\r\nHenry Byneman for Tho. Hacket, 1568_, 8vo. See Herbert’s _Ames_, p.\r\n895. Another translation of the five books was published by Edward\r\nGrimestone, London, 1634, of which a second and third edition appeared\r\nin 1648 and 1673. A translation of the Mercenary War from the first\r\nbook was made by Sir Walter Raleigh, and published after his death\r\nin 1647 (London, 4to). Next, a new translation of the five books was\r\npublished in London, 1693 (2 vols. 8vo), by Sir H[enry] S[hears],\r\nwith a preface by Dryden. In 1741 (London, 4to) appeared “A fragment\r\nof the 6th book containing a dissertation on government, translated\r\nfrom the Greek of Polybius, with notes, etc., by A Gentleman.” This\r\nwas followed by the first English translation, which contained any\r\npart of the fragments, as well as the five books, by the Rev. James\r\nHampton, London, 4to, 1756-1761, which between that date and 1823\r\n(2 vols., Oxford) went through at least seven editions. Lastly, a\r\ntranslation of Polybius’s account of Hannibal’s passage of the Alps is\r\nappended by Messrs. Church and Brodribb to their translation of Livy,\r\n21-22. There is a German translation by A. Haakh and Kraz, Stuttgart,\r\n1858-1875. And a French translation by J. A. C. Buchon, Paris, 1842,\r\nOrléans, 1875. For the numerous German essays and dissertations on\r\nthe text, and particular questions arising from the history, I must\r\nrefer my readers to Engelmann’s _Bibliotheca_. In England such studies\r\nare rare. Mr. Strachan-Davidson published an essay on Polybius in\r\nHellenica; and his edition of extracts of the text (Oxford, 1888)\r\ncontains several dissertations of value. Mr. Capes (London, 1888) has\r\npublished an edition of extracts referring to the Achaean league,\r\nwith an introductory essay on the author and his work. And a very\r\nadmirable article on Polybius appears in the recent edition of the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_ by Mr. H. F. Pelham. There is also a good\r\npaper on Polybius in the _Quarterly Review_ for 1879, No. 296.\r\nCriticisms on Polybius, and estimates of his value as an historian,\r\nwill be found in Thirlwall’s _History of Greece_, vol. viii.; Arnold’s\r\n_History of Rome_; Mommsen’s _History of Rome_, book iv. c. xiii.;\r\nFreeman’s _History of Federal Government_ and _Essays_; Bunbury’s\r\n_Ancient Geography_, vol. ii. p. 16; Law’s _Alps of Hannibal_. For\r\nthe Roman side of his history, besides the works mentioned by Mr.\r\nStrachan-Davidson, a good list of the literature on the 2d Punic war\r\nis given by Mr. W. T. Arnold in his edition of Dr. Arnold’s history of\r\nthat period [London, Macmillan, 1886].\r\n\r\nFinally, I have to express my warm thanks to Dr. Warre, Head Master of\r\nEton, for aiding me with his unique knowledge of ancient and modern\r\ntactics in clearing up many points very puzzling to a civilian. To\r\nMr. W. Chawner, Fellow and Tutor of Emmanuel College, for reading\r\npart of the translation in proof, and making valuable corrections and\r\nsuggestions. And to Professor Ridgway, of Queen’s College, Cork, for\r\ncorrections in the geographical fragments of book 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PAGES\r\n\r\n   INTRODUCTION                      xvii-lx\r\n\r\n   BOOKS I TO IX                       1-602\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nI. POLYBIUS\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune cast the life of Polybius in stirring times. His special claim\r\nto our admiration is that he understood the importance in the history\r\nof the world of the changes which were passing under his eyes, and\r\nexerted himself to trace the events which immediately preceded them,\r\nand from which they sprang, while it was yet possible to see and\r\nquestion surviving participators in them; to examine places, before\r\nthey had lost all marks of the great events of which they had been\r\nthe scene; and records or monuments before time had cast a doubt upon\r\ntheir meaning or authenticity. Nor is this ordinary praise. Men are\r\napt to turn their eyes upon the past, as holding all that is worthy of\r\ncontemplation, while they fail to take note of history “in the making,”\r\nor to grasp the importance of the transactions of their own day. But\r\nas every year has its decisive influence on the years which succeed\r\nit, the greatest benefactor of posterity is the man who understands\r\nand records events as they pass with care and sincerity. Laborious\r\ncompilation, from the study and comparison of ancient records and\r\nmonuments, has its value: it may often be all that it is possible to\r\nobtain; it may not unfrequently even serve to correct statements of\r\ncontemporaries which have been deformed by carelessness or coloured by\r\nprejudice. But the best compilation is infinitely inferior in interest\r\nand instructiveness to the barest report of a contemporary. And when\r\nsuch a man is also an eye-witness of much that he relates; when he knew\r\nand conversed with many of the chief actors in the great events which\r\nhe records; when again he tells us of transactions so remote in time,\r\nthat all written documents have necessarily perished, and those in more\r\ndurable bronze and stone all but followed in their train, then indeed\r\nthe interest rises to the highest pitch. Like Herodotus and Thucydides,\r\nthen, Polybius tells us of his own times, and of the generations\r\nimmediately preceding them. It is true that the part of his work which\r\nhas survived in a complete form deals with a period before his own\r\nday, just as the greater part of the history of Herodotus does, but in\r\nthe larger part of the fragments he is writing with even more complete\r\npersonal knowledge than Thucydides. He had, again, neither the faculty\r\nfor story-telling possessed by Herodotus nor the literary and dramatic\r\nforce of Thucydides. The language which he spoke and wrote had lost\r\nthe magic of style; had lost the lucidity and grace of Sophocles, and\r\nthe rugged vigour and terseness of Thucydides. Nor had he apparently\r\nacquired any of those artifices which, while they sometimes weary us\r\nin the later rhetoricians, yet generally serve to make their writings\r\nthe easiest and pleasantest of reading. Equally remote again is his\r\nstyle from the elaborate and involved manner of Plutarch, with its huge\r\ncompound words built up of intricate sentences, more like difficult\r\nGerman than Greek. Polybius had no tricks of this sort;[3] but his\r\nstyle lacks logical order and clearness. It seems rather the language\r\nof a man of affairs, who had had neither leisure to study style, nor\r\ntaste to read widely with a view to literature as such. But after all\r\nit is Greek, and Greek that still retained its marvellous adaptability\r\nto every purpose, to every shade of thought, and every form of\r\nliterature. Nor is his style in the purely narrative parts of his work\r\nwanting in a certain force, derived from singleness and directness of\r\npurpose. He “speaks right on,” and turns neither to the right hand nor\r\nthe left. It is when he reflects and argues and moralises, that his\r\nwant of literary skill sometimes makes him difficult and involved;\r\nand though the thought is essentially just, and his point of view\r\nwonderfully modern, we continually feel the want of that nameless charm\r\nwhich the Greeks called χάρις.\r\n\r\nHis bent for historical composition was fortunately encouraged by the\r\ncircumstances of his life, which gave Polybius special opportunities\r\nof satisfying his curiosity and completing his knowledge. Not only was\r\nhe the son of a man who had held the highest office in the league, and\r\nso must have heard the politics and history of Achaia discussed from\r\nhis earliest youth; not only from early manhood was he himself in the\r\nthick of political business; but he knew the sovereigns of Egypt and\r\nPergamus, of Macedonia and Syria, and the Roman generals who conquered\r\nthe latter. He had visited a Roman camp and witnessed its practical\r\narrangements and discipline. And his enforced residence of sixteen\r\nyears in Italy and Rome was, by the good fortune of his introduction to\r\nAemilius Paullus and his sons, turned into an opportunity of unrivalled\r\nadvantage for studying the laws, military discipline, and character\r\nof the imperial people whose world conquest he chronicles. Unlike his\r\nfellow-exiles, he did not allow his depressing circumstances to numb\r\nhis faculties, exasperate his temper, or deaden his curiosity. He won\r\nthe confidence of the leading men at Rome; and seems, while pushing on\r\nhis inquiries with untiring vigour, to have used his influence for the\r\nbenefit of his countrymen, and of all Greek subjects of Rome.\r\n\r\nBut, like so many of the writers of antiquity, he has had no one to\r\nperform for him the service he had done for others in rescuing their\r\nachievements and the particulars of their career from oblivion. Of the\r\nmany _testimonia_ collected by Schweighaeuser and others from ancient\r\nwriters, scarcely one gives us any details or anecdotes of the writer,\r\nwhose work they briefly describe or praise. We are reduced as usual to\r\npick out from his own writings the scattered allusions or statements\r\nwhich help us to picture his character and career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Birth of Polybius.]\r\n\r\nPolybius of Megalopolis was the son of Lycortas, the friend and\r\npartisan of Philopoemen, who had served the Achaean league in several\r\ncapacities: as ambassador to Rome in B.C. 189, along with Diophanes,\r\non the question of the war with Sparta,[4] and to Ptolemy Epiphanes\r\nin B.C. 186,[5] and finally as Strategus in B.C. 184-183. Of the year\r\nof his birth we cannot be certain. He tells us that he was elected\r\nto go on embassy from the league to Ptolemy Epiphanes in the year of\r\nthe death of that monarch (B.C. 181), although he was below the legal\r\nage.[6] But we do not know for certain what that age was; although\r\nit seems likely that it was thirty, that apparently being the age at\r\nwhich a member of the league exercised his full privileges.[7] But\r\nassuming this, we do not know how much under that age he was. Two years\r\npreviously (B.C. 183) he had carried the urn at Philopoemen’s funeral.\r\nThis was an office usually performed by quite young men (νεανίσκοι)[8],\r\nprobably not much over twenty years old. As we know that he lived to\r\nwrite a history of the Numantine war, which ended B.C. 133[9], and that\r\nhe was eighty-two at the time of his death[10], we shall not, I think,\r\nbe probably far wrong if we place his birth in B.C. 203 and his death\r\nin B.C. 121 as Casaubon does, who notes that the latter is just sixteen\r\nyears before the birth of Cicero. But though this is a good working\r\nhypothesis, it is very far from being a demonstrated fact.\r\n\r\nBetween B.C. 181-168 he was closely allied with his father in politics;\r\nand if we wish to have any conception of what he was doing, it is\r\nnecessary to form some idea of the state of parties in the Peloponnese\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nThe crowning achievement of Philopoemen’s career had been the uniting\r\nof Sparta to the Achaean league, after the murder of the tyrant Nabis\r\nby the Aetolians who had come to Sparta as his allies (B.C. 192). In\r\nB.C. 191 the Achaeans were allowed to add Messene and Elis to their\r\nleague, as a reward for their services to Rome in the war against\r\nAntiochus. The Aetolian league, the chief enemy and opponent of Achaia,\r\nwas reduced to a state of humble dependence on Rome in B.C. 189, after\r\nthe defeat of Antiochus at Thermopylae (B.C. 191) and the Aetolian\r\nwar (B.C. 191-189). From B.C. 190 then begins the time during which\r\nPolybius says that the “name of the Achaeans became the universal one\r\nfor all the inhabitants of the Peloponnese” (2, 42). But though Sparta\r\nwas included in the league she was always a restive and dissatisfied\r\nmember; and the people of Elis and Messene, who were not very willing\r\nmembers either, were told by Flamininus that if they had any reason to\r\ncomplain of the federal government they were to appeal to him.[11] Now,\r\nby a treaty of alliance with Rome, decreed at Sikyon in B.C. 198, it\r\nwas provided that Rome should receive no envoys from separate states of\r\nthe league, but only from the league itself.[12] Flamininus, therefore,\r\nif he said what Livy reports him to have said, was violating this\r\ntreaty. And this will be a good instance to illustrate the divisions\r\nof parties existing during the period of Polybius’s active political\r\nlife (B.C. 181-169). We have seen that in B.C. 198 the Achaean league\r\nbecame an ally of Rome as a complete and independent state; that this\r\nstate was consolidated by the addition of Sparta (192) and Elis and\r\nMessene (191) so as to embrace the whole of the Peloponnese; that its\r\nchief enemy in Greece, the Aetolian league, was rendered powerless\r\nin B.C. 189. The Macedonian influence in the Peloponnese had been\r\nabolished after the battle of Cynoscephalae (197) by the proclamation\r\nof Greek freedom by Flamininus (196). But all this seeming liberty\r\nand growth in power really depended upon the favour of Rome, and was\r\ncontinually endangered not only by the appeals to the Senate from\r\nseparate states in the league, who conceived themselves wronged, but by\r\ntreasonable representations of her own envoys, who preferred a party\r\ntriumph to the welfare and independence of their country[13]. In these\r\ncircumstances, there were naturally differences of opinion as to the\r\nproper attitude for the league government to assume towards a state,\r\nwhich was nominally an equal ally, but really an absolute master. There\r\nwas one party who were for submissively carrying out the will of the\r\nRoman officers who from time to time visited the Peloponnese; and for\r\nconciliating the Senate by displaying a perpetual readiness to carry\r\nout its wishes, without putting forward in any way the rights which\r\nthe treaty of 198 had secured to them. The leaders of this party, in\r\nthe time of Philopoemen, were Aristaenos and Diophanes. The other\r\nparty, headed till his death by Philopoemen, equally admitting that the\r\nRoman government could not be safely defied, were yet for aiming at\r\npreserving their country’s independence by strictly carrying out the\r\nterms of the Roman alliance, and respectfully but firmly resisting any\r\nencroachment upon those terms by the officers representing the Roman\r\ngovernment. On Philopoemen’s death (B.C. 183) Lycortas, who had been\r\nhis most devoted follower, took, along with Archon, the lead of the\r\nparty which were for carrying out his policy; while Callicrates became\r\nthe most prominent of the Romanising party. Lycortas was supported\r\nby his son Polybius when about B.C. 181 he began to take part in\r\npolitics. Polybius seems always to have consistently maintained this\r\npolicy. His view seems to have been that Rome, having crushed Philip\r\nand Antiochus, was necessarily the supreme power. The Greeks must\r\nrecognise facts; must avoid offending Rome; but must do so by keeping\r\nto a position of strict legality, maintaining their rights, and neither\r\nflattering nor defying the victorious Commonwealth. He believed that\r\nthe Romans meant fairly by Greece, and that Greek freedom was safe\r\nin their hands[14]. But the straightforward policy of the Senate, if\r\nit was ever sincere, was altered by the traitor Callicrates in B.C.\r\n179; who, being sent to Rome to oppose what the league thought the\r\nunconstitutional restitution of certain Spartan exiles, advised the\r\nSenate to use the Romanising party in each state to secure a direct\r\ncontrol in Achaia[15]. Acting on this insidious advice, the Roman\r\ngovernment began to view with suspicion the legal and independent\r\nattitude of the other party, and to believe or affect to believe\r\nthat they were enemies of the Roman supremacy. Lycortas, Archon,\r\nand Polybius, finding themselves the objects of suspicion, not less\r\ndangerous because undeserved, to the Roman government, appear to have\r\nadopted an attitude of reserve, abstaining from taking an active or\r\nprominent part in the business of the assemblies. This, however, did\r\nnot succeed in averting Roman jealousy; and the commissioners, Gaius\r\nPopilius and Gnaeus Octavius, who visited the Peloponnese in B.C. 169,\r\ngave out that those who held aloof were as displeasing to the Senate\r\nas those who openly opposed it. They were said to have resolved on\r\nformally impeaching the three statesmen before the Achaean assembly\r\nas being enemies of Rome; but when the assembly met at Aegium, they\r\nhad failed to obtain any reasonable handle against them, and contented\r\nthemselves with a speech of general exhortation.[16] This was during\r\nthe war with Perseus, when the Romans kept a vigilant eye on all parts\r\nof Greece, and closely inquired which politicians in the several\r\nstates ventured to display the least sympathy with the Macedonian\r\nking, or were believed to secretly nourish any wish for his success.\r\nIt speaks strongly both for the independent spirit still surviving in\r\nthe league, as well as for the character of Archon and Polybius, that\r\nthey were elected, apparently in the same assembly, the one Strategus\r\nand the other Hipparch for the year B.C. 169-168.[17] In this office\r\nPolybius doubtless hoped to carry out the principles and discipline\r\nof Philopoemen, under whom he had probably served in the cavalry, and\r\nwhose management of this branch of the service he had at any rate\r\nminutely studied.[18] But there was little occasion for the use of the\r\nAchaean cavalry in his year. Being sent on a mission to Q. Marcius\r\nPhilippus at Heracleia to offer the league’s assistance in the war\r\nwith Perseus, when their help was declined, he remained behind after\r\nthe other ambassadors had returned, to witness the campaign.[19] After\r\nspending some time in the Roman camp, he was sent by Q. Marcius to\r\nprevent the Achaeans from consenting to supply five thousand men to\r\nAppius Claudius Cento in Epirus. This was a matter of considerable\r\ndelicacy. He had to choose between offending one or the other powerful\r\nRoman. But he conducted the affair with prudence, and on the lines\r\nhe had always laid down, those, namely, of strict legality. He found\r\nthe Achaean assembly in session at Sicyon; and he carried his point\r\nby representing that the demand of Appius Claudius did not bear on\r\nthe face of it the order of the Senate, without which they were\r\nprohibited from supplying the requisitions of Roman commanders.[20] He\r\nthus did not betray that he was acting on the instigation of Quintus\r\nMarcius, and put himself and the league in an attitude of loyalty\r\ntoward the Senate.[21] In the same cautious spirit he avoided another\r\ncomplication. Certain complimentary statues or inscriptions had been\r\nput up in various cities of the league in honour of Eumenes, king of\r\nPergamus, and on some offence arising had been taken down. This seems\r\nto have annoyed Eumenes exceedingly; and Polybius persuaded the people\r\nthat it had been ordered by Sosigenes and Diopeithes, as judges, from\r\nfeelings of personal spite, and without any act of Eumenes unfriendly\r\nto the league. He carried his point, and thus avoided offending a\r\nking who at that time was on very friendly terms with Rome.[22] But\r\nwhile thus minded to avoid unnecessary offence, Polybius and his party\r\nwere in favour of strengthening the league by alliances which could\r\nbe entered upon with safety. Egypt at this time was under the joint\r\ngovernment of two Ptolemies, Philometor and Physcon, who were being\r\nthreatened with an invasion by Antiochus Epiphanes. The friendship\r\nof the league with the kings of Egypt had been of long standing, as\r\nfar back as the time of Aratus; and though that friendship had been\r\nafterwards interrupted by the Macedonian policy of Aratus, just before\r\nhis death the father of these kings had presented the league with ten\r\nships and a sum of money. The two kings now sent to beg for aid; and\r\nasked that Lycortas should come as commander-in-chief, and Polybius\r\nas hipparch. Lycortas and Polybius were in favour of supplying the\r\nassistance asked.[23] But the measure was opposed by Callicrates and\r\nhis partisans, on the specious ground that their whole efforts should\r\nbe directed to aid the Romans against Perseus. Lycortas and Polybius\r\nreplied that the Romans did not require their help; and that they were\r\nbound, by gratitude, as well as by treaty, to help the Ptolemies. They\r\ncarried with them the popular feeling: but Callicrates outwitted them\r\nby obtaining a dispatch from Q. Marcius, urging the league to join the\r\nsenate in effecting a reconciliation between Antiochus and the kings\r\nof Egypt. Polybius gave in, and advised compliance. Ambassadors were\r\nappointed to aid in the pacification; and the envoys from Alexandria\r\nwere obliged to depart without effecting their object. They contented\r\nthemselves with handing in to the magistrates the Royal letters,\r\nin which Lycortas and Polybius were invited by name to come to\r\nAlexandria.[24]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 167.]\r\n\r\nCareful, however, as he had ever been to avoid giving just offence to\r\nRome, he and his party had long been marked by the Senate as opponents\r\nof that more complete interference in the details of Achaean politics\r\nwhich it wished to exercise. This was partly owing to the machinations\r\nof Callicrates; but it was also the result of the deliberate policy of\r\nthe Senate: and it was doubtless helped by the report of every Roman\r\nofficer who had found himself thwarted by the appeal to legality,\r\nunder the influence of the party in the league with which Polybius was\r\nconnected.[25] Accordingly, soon after the final defeat of Perseus\r\nby Aemilius Paulus in B.C. 168, and the consequent dismemberment of\r\nMacedonia, the Senate proceeded to execute its vengeance upon those\r\ncitizens in every state in Greece who were believed to have been\r\nopposed to the Roman interests. The commissioners entrusted with\r\nthe settlement and division of Macedonia were directed to hold an\r\ninquiry into this matter also. From every city the extreme partisans\r\nof Rome were summoned to assist them, men who were only too ready to\r\nsacrifice their political opponents to the vengeance of the power to\r\nwhich they had long been paying a servile and treacherous court. From\r\nBoeotia came Mnasippus; from Acarnania, Chremes; from Epirus, Charops\r\nand Nicias; from Aetolia, Lyciscus and Tisippus; and from Achaia,\r\nCallicrates, Agesias, and Philippus.[26] Instigated by these advisers,\r\nthe commissioners ordered the supposed covert enemies of Rome in the\r\nseveral states to proceed to Italy to take their trial. To Achaia\r\ntwo commissioners, Gaius Claudius and Gnaeus Domitius, were sent. An\r\nAchaean assembly being summoned to meet them, they announced that there\r\nwere certain men of influence in the league who had helped Perseus by\r\nmoney and other support. They required that a vote should be passed\r\ncondemning them all to death; and said that, when that was done, they\r\nwould publish the names. Such a monstrous perversion of justice was\r\ntoo much for the assembly, who refused to vote until they knew the\r\nnames. The commissioners then said that all the Strategi who had been\r\nin office since the beginning of the war were involved. One of them,\r\nXeno, came forward, declared his innocence, and asserted that he was\r\nready to plead his cause before any tribunal, Achaean or Roman. Upon\r\nthis the commissioners required that all the accused persons should go\r\nto Rome. A list of one thousand names was drawn up, under the guidance\r\nof Callicrates, of those who were at once to proceed to Italy[27] (B.C.\r\n167). The court of inquiry, before which they were to appear, was never\r\nheld. They were not allowed even to stay in Rome, but were quartered\r\nin various cities of Italy, which were made responsible for their safe\r\ncustody: and there they remained until B.C. 151, when such of them as\r\nwere still alive, numbering then somewhat less than three hundred, were\r\ncontemptuously allowed to return.[28] Among these detenus was Polybius.\r\nWe do not hear that Lycortas was also one, from which it has been with\r\nsome probability supposed that he was dead. More fortunate than the\r\nrest, Polybius was allowed to remain at Rome. He had made, it seems,\r\nthe acquaintance of Aemilius Paulus and his two sons in Macedonia, and\r\nduring the tour of Amelius through Greece after the Macedonian war.[29]\r\nAnd on their return to Italy he was allowed by their influence to\r\nremain in Rome; and, acting as tutor to the two boys,[30] became well\r\nacquainted with all the best society in the city. The charming account\r\nwhich he gives[31] of the mutual affection existing between him and\r\nthe younger son of Aemilius (by adoption now called Publius Scipio\r\nAfricanus Aemilianus) bears all the marks of sincerity, and is highly\r\nto the credit of both. To it we may add the anecdote of Plutarch, that\r\n“Scipio, in observance of the precept of Polybius, endeavoured never to\r\nleave the forum without having made a close friend of some one he met\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nBut much as he owed to the friendship of the sons of Aemilius, he\r\nowed it also to his own energy and cheerful vigour that these sixteen\r\nyears of exile were not lost time in his life. He employed them, not\r\nin fruitless indulgence in homesickness, or in gloomy brooding over\r\nhis wrongs, but in a careful and industrious study of the history and\r\ninstitutions of the people among whom he was compelled to reside[32];\r\nin ingratiating himself with those members of the Senate who he thought\r\nmight be useful to his countrymen; and in forming and maturing his\r\njudgment as to the course of policy they ought to pursue. Nor was he\r\nwithout means of gratifying lighter tastes. He was an active sportsman:\r\nand the boar-hunting in the district of Laurentum not only diverted his\r\nattention from the distressing circumstances of his exile, and kept\r\nhis body in vigorous health, but obtained for him the acquaintance of\r\nmany men of rank and influence. Thus for instance his intimacy with\r\nthe Syrian prince Demetrius, afterwards king Demetrius Soter, was made\r\nin the hunting-field[33]: and the value which this young man attached\r\nto his advice and support is some measure of the opinion entertained\r\ngenerally of his wisdom, moderation, and good judgment. We have no\r\nfurther details of his life in Rome; but we have what is better,—its\r\nfruits, in the luminous account of its polity, the constitution of its\r\narmy, and the aims of its statesmen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 151. Release of the detenus.]\r\n\r\nAt last the time came when he was once more free to visit his own\r\ncountry, or to extend his knowledge by visiting the countries which\r\nhe wished to describe. After repeated applications to the Senate\r\nby embassies from Achaia, made without avail, in B.C. 151 Polybius\r\nappeared in person to plead the cause before the Fathers. There was\r\nnow, it was thought, no reason for retaining these unfortunate men. The\r\noriginal thousand had shrunk to less than three hundred; middle-aged\r\nmen had become in sixteen years old and decrepit; they had lost\r\nconnexions and influence in the Peloponnese; they had learnt by bitter\r\nexperience the impossibility of resisting the power of Rome, and were\r\nno longer likely to venture on organising any opposition. Their longer\r\ndetention could only be a measure of vengeance, and useless vengeance.\r\nStill the debate in the Senate was long and doubtful, until it was\r\nbrought to a conclusion by the contemptuous exclamation of Cato: “Are\r\nwe to sit here all day discussing whether some old Greek dotards are\r\nto be buried by Italian or Achaean undertakers?” Polybius, elated by\r\na concession thus ungraciously accorded, wished to enter the Senate\r\nonce more with a further request for a restitution of their property in\r\nAchaia. But Cato bluntly bade him “remember Ulysses, who wanted to go\r\nback into the cave of the Cyclops to fetch his cap and belt.”[34]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coss. L. Marcius Censornius, Manius Manilius, B.C. 149.\r\nPolybius sent for to Lilybaeum.]\r\n\r\nPolybius seems to have returned to the Peloponnese at once, and to have\r\nremained there until B.C. 149, when he was suddenly summoned to serve\r\nthe government whose enforced guest he had been so long. It was the\r\nyear in which the Senate had determined to commence their proceedings\r\nagainst Carthage, which were not to be stayed until she was levelled\r\nwith the ground. In B.C. 150 the victory of Massanissa had restored the\r\noligarchs, who had been superseded by the popular anti-Roman party in\r\nCarthage. These men hastened to make every possible offer of submission\r\nto Rome. The Senate had made up its mind for war; and yet did not at\r\nonce say so. After demanding that full satisfaction should be made to\r\nMassanissa, it next decreed that the Carthaginians must at once give\r\nthree hundred of their noblest youths as hostages to the Roman consuls\r\nManilius and Censorinus, who had sailed to Lilybaeum with secret orders\r\nto let no concession induce them to stop the war until Carthage was\r\ndestroyed.[35] There was naturally some hesitation in obeying this\r\ndemand at Carthage; for the hostages were to be given to the Romans\r\nabsolutely without any terms, and without any security. They felt\r\nthat it was practically a surrender of their city. To overcome this\r\nhesitation Manilius sent for Polybius, perhaps because he had known and\r\nrespected him at Rome, and believed that he could trust him; perhaps\r\nbecause his well-known opinion, as to the safety in trusting the Roman\r\n_fides_, might make him a useful agent. But also probably because he\r\nwas known to many influential Carthaginians, and perhaps spoke their\r\nlanguage.[36] He started for Lilybaeum at once. But when he reached\r\nCorcyra he was met with the news that the hostages had been given up\r\nto the consul: he thought, therefore, that the chance of war was at an\r\nend, and he returned to the Peloponnese.[37]\r\n\r\nHe must soon have learnt his mistake. The Consul, in accordance with\r\nhis secret instructions,—first to secure the arms in Carthage, and\r\nthen to insist on the destruction of the town,—gradually let the\r\nwretched people know the extent of the submission required of them.\r\nThese outrageous demands resulted in the Carthaginians taking the\r\ndesperate resolution of standing a siege. Censorinus and his colleague\r\naccordingly began operations; but they were not capable of so great\r\nan undertaking. The eyes of the whole army were turned upon Scipio\r\nAemilianus, who was serving as a military tribune. The siege lingered\r\nthrough the summer of B.C. 148 without any result; and when in the\r\nautumn Scipio left for Rome, to stand for the Aedileship, he started\r\namidst loud expressions of hope that he might return as Consul, though\r\nbelow the legal age.[38]\r\n\r\nThe loss of so much of Polybius’s narrative at this point leaves us\r\nuncertain when he arrived in Africa: but as he met and conversed with\r\nMassanissa,[39] who died in B.C. 148, it seems likely that he did join\r\nthe army after all in B.C. 149. At any rate he was in Scipio’s train\r\nin B.C. 147-146, when he was in chief command of the army, first as\r\nconsul, and then as proconsul; advised him on sundry points in the\r\nformation of his siege works; stood by his side when Carthage was\r\nburning; and heard him, as he watched the dreadful sight, utter with\r\ntearful eyes the foreboding of what might one day befall Rome.[40]\r\nScipio is also said to have supplied him with ships for an exploring\r\nexpedition round the coast of Africa;[41] and it seems most likely that\r\nthis was in his year of consulship (147), as after the fall of Carthage\r\nPolybius went home.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of Carthage took place in the spring of B.C. 146. When\r\nScipio went back to celebrate his triumph, Polybius seems to have\r\nreturned to the Peloponnese, there to witness another act of vengeance\r\non the part of Rome, and to do what he could to lighten the blow to his\r\ncountrymen, and to preserve the fragments of their shattered liberties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 147.]\r\n\r\nAmong the restored Achaean exiles were Diaeus, Damocritus, Alcamenes,\r\nTheodectes, and Archicrates. They had returned with feelings embittered\r\nby their exile; and without any of the experience of active life, which\r\nmight have taught them to subordinate their private thirst for revenge\r\nto the safety of their country. Callicrates died in B.C. 148, and\r\nDiaeus was Strategus in B.C. 149-148, 147-146. The appearance of the\r\npseudo-Philip (Andriscus) in Macedonia, and the continued resistance\r\nof Carthage during his first year of office (148), encouraged him\r\nperhaps to venture on a course, and to recommend the people to adopt\r\na policy, on which he would otherwise not have ventured. Troubles\r\narising out of a disgraceful money transaction between the Spartan\r\nMenalchidas, Achaean Strategus, and the Oropians, who had bribed him\r\nto aid them against the Athenians, had led to a violent quarrel with\r\nCallicrates, who threatened to impeach him for treason to the league\r\nin the course of an embassy to Rome. To save himself he gave half the\r\nOropian money to Diaeus, his successor as Strategus (B.C. 149-148).\r\nThis led to a popular clamour against Diaeus: who, to save himself,\r\nfalsely reported that the Senate had granted the Achaeans leave to try\r\nand condemn certain Spartans for the offence of occupying a disputed\r\nterritory. Sparta was prepared to resist in arms, and a war seemed to\r\nbe on the point of breaking out. Callicrates and Diaeus, however, were\r\nsent early in B.C. 148 to place the Achaean case before the Senate,\r\nwhile the Spartans sent Menalchidas. Callicrates died on the road. The\r\nSenate heard, therefore, the two sides from Diaeus and Menalchidas, and\r\nanswered that they would send commissioners to inquire into the case.\r\nThe commissioners, however, were slow in coming; so that both Diaeus\r\nand Menalchidas had time to misrepresent the Senate’s answer to their\r\nrespective peoples. The Achaeans believed that they had full leave to\r\nproceed according to the league law against the Spartans; the Spartans\r\nbelieved that they had permission to break off from the league. Once\r\nmore, therefore, war was on the point of breaking out.[42] Just at\r\nthis time Q. Caecilius Metellus was in Macedonia with an army to crush\r\nAndriscus. He was sending some commissioners to Asia, and ordered them\r\nto visit the Peloponnese on their way and give a friendly warning. It\r\nwas neglected, and the Spartans sustained a defeat, which irritated\r\nthem without crushing their revolt. When Diaeus succeeded Damocritus as\r\nStrategus in B.C. 147, he answered a second embassy from Metellus by\r\na promise not to take any hostile steps until the Roman commissioners\r\narrived. But he irritated the Spartans by putting garrisons into some\r\nforts which commanded Laconia; and they actually elected Menalchidas as\r\na Strategus in opposition to Diaeus. But finding that he had no chance\r\nof success Menalchidas poisoned himself.[43]\r\n\r\nThen followed the riot at Corinth.[44] Marcus Aurelius Orestes at the\r\nhead of a commission arrived at last at Corinth, and there informed the\r\nmagistrates in council that the league must give up Argos, Corinth,\r\nand Sparta. The magistrates hastily summoned an assembly and announced\r\nthe message from the Senate; a furious riot followed, every man in\r\nCorinth suspected of being a Spartan was seized and thrown into prison;\r\nthe very residence of the Roman commissioners was not able to afford\r\nsuch persons any protection, and even the persons of Orestes and his\r\ncolleagues were in imminent danger.\r\n\r\nSome months afterwards a second commission arrived headed by Sextus\r\nJulius Caesar, and demanded, without any express menace, that the\r\nauthors of the riot should be given up. The demand was evaded; and when\r\nCaesar returned to Rome with his report, war was at once declared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 147-146.]\r\n\r\nThe new Strategus, elected in the autumn of B.C. 147, was Critolaus.\r\nHe was a bitter anti-Romanist like Diaeus: and these statesmen and\r\ntheir party fancied that the Romans, having already two wars on hand,\r\nat Carthage and in Spain, would make any sacrifice to keep peace with\r\nAchaia. They had not indeed openly declined the demands of Sextus,\r\nbut, to use Polybius’s expressive phrase, “they accepted with the left\r\nhand what the Romans offered with the right.”[45] While pretending to\r\nbe preparing to submit their case to the Senate, they were collecting\r\nan army from the cities of the league. Inspired with an inexplicable\r\ninfatuation, which does not deserve the name of courage, Critolaus even\r\nadvanced northwards towards Thermopylae, as if he could with his petty\r\nforce bar the road to the Romans and free Greece. He was encouraged,\r\nit was said, by a party at Thebes which had suffered from Rome for its\r\nMacedonising policy. But, rash as the march was, it was managed with at\r\nleast equal imprudence. Instead of occupying Thermopylae, they stopped\r\nshort of it to besiege Trachinian Heracleia, an old Spartan colony,[46]\r\nwhich refused to join the league. While engaged in this, Critolaus\r\nheard that Metellus (who wished to anticipate his successor Mummius)\r\nwas on the march from Macedonia. He beat a hasty retreat to Scarpheia\r\nin Locris,[47] which was on the road leading to Elateia and the south;\r\nhere he was overtaken and defeated with considerable slaughter.\r\nCritolaus appears not to have fallen on the field; but he was never\r\nseen again. He was either lost in some marshes over which he attempted\r\nto escape, as Pausanias suggests, or poisoned himself, as Livy says.\r\nDiaeus, as his predecessor, became Strategus, and was elected for the\r\nfollowing year also. Diaeus exerted himself to collect troops for\r\nthe defence of Corinth, nominally as being at war with Sparta. He\r\nsucceeded in getting as many as fourteen thousand infantry and six\r\nhundred cavalry, consisting partly of citizens and partly of slaves;\r\nand sent four thousand picked men under Alcamenes to hold Megara, while\r\nhe himself occupied Corinth. When Metellus approached, however, this\r\noutpost at Megara hastily retreated into Corinth. Metellus took up his\r\nposition in the Isthmus, and offered the Achaeans the fairest terms.\r\nDiaeus, however, induced them to reject all offers; and Metellus was\r\nkept some time encamped before Corinth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 146. Arrival of Mummius.]\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the spring of B.C. 146, and the new Consul, Lucius\r\nMummius, arrived at the Roman camp. He at once sent Metellus back to\r\nMacedonia, and quietly awaited the arrival of fresh troops, which he\r\nhad sent for from Crete and Pergamum, as well as from Italy.[48] He\r\neventually had an army of about thirty thousand men, nearly double\r\nof the Greek army in Corinth. Nothing apparently was done till the\r\nlate summer, or autumn. But then the final catastrophe was rapid and\r\ncomplete. The Roman officers regarded the Achaean force with such\r\ncontempt, that they did not take proper precautions, so that Diaeus\r\nwon a slight advantage against one of the Roman outposts. Flushed with\r\nthis success, he drew out for a pitched battle, in which he was totally\r\ndefeated. He made his way to Megalopolis, where, after killing his\r\nwife, he poisoned himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Polybius saves some statues of national interest.]\r\n\r\nThus by a series of imprudent measures, which Polybius denounces,\r\nbut was not at home to oppose, the Achaean league had drifted into\r\ndownright war with Rome; and, almost without a struggle, had fallen\r\nhelplessly at her feet, forced to accept whatever her mercy or contempt\r\nmight grant. Mercy, however, was to be preceded by stern punishment.\r\nCorinth was given up to plunder and to fire, and Polybius returned\r\nfrom Africa in time to witness it.[49] The destruction or deportation\r\nof works of art, of pictures, statues, and costly furniture, he could\r\nnot prevent; but he spoke a successful word to preserve the statues of\r\nPhilopoemen in the various cities from destruction; and also begged\r\nsuccessfully for the restoration of some of the Eponymous hero Achaeus,\r\nand of Philopoemen and Aratus, which had already been transported as\r\nfar as Acarnania on their way to Italy.[50] He also dissuaded his\r\nfriends from rushing to take their share in the plunder by purchasing\r\nthe confiscated goods of Diaeus, which were put to auction and could be\r\nbought at low rates; and he refused to accept any of them himself.[51]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new settlement of the Peloponnese, B.C. 146-145.]\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the territories of the league was put into the hands\r\nof a commission of ten men who were sent out after the sack of Corinth;\r\nwhile Mummius, after seeing that such towns in the Peloponnese as had\r\njoined in the war were deprived of their fortifications and arms, and\r\nafter inflicting punishment upon other towns in Greece which had shown\r\nactive sympathy with Perseus, especially Thebes and Chalcis, returned\r\nhome to celebrate his triumph, which was adorned with marble and bronze\r\nstatues and pictures from Corinth.[52] The commissioners who had been\r\nsent out to make a final settlement of Greece, or Achaia, as it was\r\nhenceforth to be called in official language, settled the general\r\nplan in conjunction with Mummius; but the commissioners continued\r\ntheir labours for six months, at the end of which time they departed,\r\nleaving Polybius to settle with each town the details of their local\r\nlegislation. The general principles which the commissioners laid down\r\nwere first, the entire abolition of all the leagues, and consequently\r\nof the league assemblies; each town, with its surrounding district,\r\nwhich had once formed a canton in the league, was to be separate and\r\nindependent: its magistrates, secondly, were to be selected according\r\nto a fixed assessment of property, the old equality or democracy\r\nbeing abolished: thirdly, no member of one canton might own property\r\nin another: fourthly, the Boeotians were ordered to pay a heavy\r\ncompensation to the Heracleots and Euboeans, and the Achaeans to the\r\nSpartans: lastly, a fixed tribute to Rome was imposed on all states\r\nin Greece.[53] Some of these measures were in a few years’ time\r\nrelaxed, the fines were mitigated, the rule against inter-possession of\r\nproperty was abolished, and the league assemblies were again allowed\r\nfor certain local purposes. But this was the end of the league as a\r\nfree federation. It is often said that “Greece was now reduced to the\r\nform of a Roman province under the name of Achaia.” This is true in a\r\nsense, and yet is misleading. Achaia did not become a province like\r\nthe other provinces, yearly allotted to a proconsul or propraetor or\r\nlegatus, until the time of Augustus. Such direct interference from a\r\nRoman magistrate as was thought necessary was left to the governor of\r\nMacedonia.[54] Yet in a certain sense Achaia was treated as a separate\r\nentity, and had a “formula,” or constitution, founded on the separate\r\nlocal laws which the commissioners found existing, or imposed, with the\r\nhelp of Polybius, on the several states; it paid tribute like other\r\nprovinces, and was in fact, though called free, subject to Rome.\r\n\r\nPolybius performed his task of visiting the various towns in the\r\nPeloponnese, explaining when necessary the meaning of the new\r\narrangements, and advising them, when they had to make others for\r\nthemselves, so much to the satisfaction of every one, that there was\r\na universal feeling that he had been a benefactor to his country, and\r\nhad made the best of their situation that could be made. Statues of him\r\nare mentioned by Pausanias in several places in the Peloponnese: in\r\nMantinea[55] and at Megalopolis,[56] with an inscription in elegiacs\r\nto the effect that “he had travelled over every land and sea; was an\r\nally of the Romans, and mitigated their wrath against Greece.” Another\r\nin the temple of Persephone, near Acacesium,[57] under which was a\r\nlegend stating that “Greece would not have erred at all if she had\r\nobeyed Polybius; and that when she did err, he alone proved of any\r\nhelp to her.” There were others also at Pallantium,[58] Tegea,[59] and\r\nOlympia.[60]\r\n\r\nIn these services to his country Polybius was occupied in B.C. 145.\r\nOf his life after that we have no detailed record. He is believed\r\nto have visited Scipio while engaged on the siege of Numantia (B.C.\r\n134-132), on which he wrote a separate treatise.[61] We know also\r\nthat he visited Alexandria in the reign of Ptolemy Physcon (B.C.\r\n146-117), and expressed his contempt for the state of the people and\r\ntheir rulers.[62] These years must have been also much occupied with\r\nthe extension of his history, which he originally intended should\r\nend with the fall of the Macedonian kingdom (B.C. 168),[63] but\r\nwhich was afterwards continued to the fall of Carthage and Greece\r\n(B.C. 146);[64] for even if the history had been completed up to its\r\noriginally intended limit, and the notice of extension afterwards\r\ninserted, there still was enough to do to occupy some years of a busy\r\nlife; especially as he seems to have carried out his principle that an\r\nhistorian ought to be a traveller, visiting the localities of which\r\nhe speaks, and testing by personal inspection the possibility of the\r\nmilitary evolutions which he undertakes to describe. His travels appear\r\ncertainly to have embraced the greater part of Gaul, and it even seems\r\npossible from one passage that he visited Britain.[65] His explorations\r\non the African coast were doubtless extensive, and he appears to have\r\nvisited Phoenicia, Cilicia, and Asia Minor. We hear of him at Sardis,\r\nthough we cannot fix the date of the visit.[66] Lastly, Lucian tells us\r\nthat, “returning from the country, he had a fall from his horse, the\r\neffects of which he died at the age of eighty-two.” No place is given,\r\nand no clue which may help us to be certain of the date.[67] Polybius,\r\nbesides the general history, had written a treatise on Tactics,[68] a\r\npanegyric on Philopoemen,[69] a history of the Numantine war,[70] and\r\nperhaps a treatise on public speaking (δημηγορία).[71]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.—THE SOURCES OF POLYBIUS’S HISTORY\r\n\r\nPolybius always maintains that the study of documents is only one, and\r\nnot the most important, element in the equipment of an historian. The\r\nbest is personal experience and personal inquiry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal knowledge.]\r\n\r\nOf the sources of his own history, then, the first and best may be set\r\ndown as knowledge acquired by being actually present at great events,\r\nsuch as the destruction of Carthage and the sack of Corinth; visits to\r\nthe Roman army in camp; assisting at actual debates in his own country;\r\npersonal knowledge of and service under men of the first position\r\nin Achaia; personal visits to famous localities; voyages and tours\r\nundertaken for the definite object of inspection and inquiry; and,\r\nlastly, seeing and questioning the survivors of great battles, or the\r\nmen who had played a leading part in conspicuous political transactions.\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest youth Polybius had enjoyed some special advantages\r\nin these respects. As he himself says, “the events in Greece fell\r\nwithin his own generation, or that immediately preceding his own,—and\r\nhe therefore could relate what he had seen, or what he had heard from\r\neye-witnesses” (4, 2). And of the later period he “was not only an eye\r\nwitness, but in some cases an actor, and in others the chief actor”\r\n(3, 4). When he was probably under twenty we hear of his being present\r\nat an important interview between Philopoemen and Archon;[72] and his\r\nelection as hipparch in B.C. 169, soon after he reached the legal age,\r\nwas in consequence of his having thrown himself with vigour into the\r\npractical working of the cavalry under Philopoemen. In regard to Roman\r\nhistory and polity, we have Cicero’s testimony that he was _bonus\r\nauctor in primis_,[73] and more particularly in regard to chronology,\r\n_quo nemo fuit in exquirendis temporibus diligentius_.[74] Nor is\r\nthis praise undeserved, as is shown by his energy in pushing minute\r\nand personal inquiries. Thus he learnt the details of the Hannibalic\r\nwar from some of the survivors of those actually engaged; visited the\r\nlocalities, and made the pass of the Alps used by Hannibal;[75] studied\r\nand transcribed the stele or bronze tablet placed by Hannibal on the\r\nLacinian promontory;[76] travelled through Libya, Spain, Gaul, and the\r\nseas which washed their shores (perhaps even as far as Britain), in\r\norder to give a true account of them.[77] Conversed with Massanissa\r\non the character of the Carthaginians, as well as with many of the\r\nCarthaginians themselves.[78] Carefully observed Carthagena.[79]\r\nInspected the records at Rhodes,[80] and the Archives at Rome;[81]\r\nand studied and transcribed the treaties preserved there.[82] Visited\r\nSardis,[83] Alexandria,[84] and Locri Epizephyrii.[85] To this, which\r\nis by no means an exhaustive account of his travels and inquiries,\r\nmay be added the fact that his intimacy with the younger Africanus,\r\ngrandson by adoption and nephew by marriage of the elder Scipio,\r\nmust have placed at his disposal a considerable mass of information\r\ncontained in the family archives of the Scipios, as to the Hannibalian\r\nwar, and especially as to the campaigns in Spain.[86]\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the means by which Polybius was enabled to obtain\r\naccurate and trustworthy information.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Use of previous writers by Polybius.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to inquire how far Polybius availed himself of the writings\r\nof others. He looks upon the study of books as an important part of\r\nan historian’s work, but, as we have seen, not the most important.\r\nHis practice appears to have been conformable to his theory. The\r\ngreater part of his information he gained from personal observation\r\nand personal inquiry. Nevertheless, some of his history must have been\r\nlearnt from books, and very little of it could have been entirely\r\nindependent of them. Still, as far as we have the means of judging from\r\nthe fragments of his work that have come down to us, his obligations\r\nto his predecessors are not as extensive as that of most of those who\r\nwrote after him; nor is the number of those to whom he refers great.[87]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Punic wars.]\r\n\r\nOf his preliminary sketch contained in books 1 and 2, the first book,\r\ncontaining the account of the first Punic war and the Mercenary war,\r\nappears to have been derived mainly from the writings of Fabius Pictor\r\n(b. circ. B.C. 260), and Philinus of Agrigentum (contemporary and\r\nsecretary of Hannibal). He complains that they were violent partisans,\r\nthe one of Rome, the other of Carthage.[88] But by comparing the two,\r\nand checking both by documents and inscriptions at Rome, he, no doubt,\r\nfound sufficient material for his purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illyrians and Gauls.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaia.]\r\n\r\nThe second book contains an account of the origin of the war between\r\nRome and Illyricum; of the Gallic or Celtic wars from the earliest\r\ntimes; and a sketch of Achaean history to the end of the Cleomenic\r\nwar. The first two of these must have been compiled with great labour\r\nfrom various public documents and family records, as well as in part\r\nfrom Pictor. The sketch of Achaean history rested mainly, as far as\r\nit depends on books, on the Memoirs of Aratus; while he studied only\r\nto refute the writings of Phylarchus the panegyrist of Cleomenes. He\r\ncomplains of the partiality of Phylarchus: but in this part of the\r\nhistory it was perhaps inevitable that his own views should have been\r\ncoloured by the prejudices and prepossessions of a politician, and one\r\nwho had been closely connected from boyhood with the patriotic Achaean\r\nparty, led by Philopoemen, which was ever at enmity with all that\r\nCleomenes did his utmost to establish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sicilian history.]\r\n\r\nFor his account of Sicilian affairs he had studied the works of Timaeus\r\nof Tauromeniun. Although he accuses him bitterly, and at excessive\r\nlength,[89] of all the faults of which an historian can be guilty, he\r\nyet confesses that he found in his books much that was of assistance to\r\nhim[90] in regard both to Magna Graecia and Sicily; for which he also\r\nconsulted the writings of Aristotle, especially it appears the now lost\r\nworks on Polities (πολιτείαι), and Founding of Cities (κτίσεις). The\r\nseverity of his criticism of Timaeus is supported by later authors.\r\nHe was nicknamed ἐπιτίμαιος, in allusion to the petulance of his\r\ncriticism of others;[91] and Plutarch attacks him for his perversion\r\nof truth and his foolish and self-satisfied attempts to rival the best\r\nof the ancient writers, and to diminish the credit of the most famous\r\nphilosophers.[92]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek history.]\r\n\r\nAs far as we possess his writings, we find little trace in Polybius of\r\na reference to the earliest historians. Herodotus is not mentioned,\r\nthough there may be some indications of acquaintance with his work;[93]\r\nnor the Sicilian Philistus who flourished about B.C. 430. Thucydides\r\nis mentioned once, and Xenophon three times. Polybius was engaged in\r\nthe history of a definite period, and had not much occasion to refer to\r\nearlier times; and perhaps the epitomator, in extracting what seemed\r\nof value, chose those parts especially where he was the sole or best\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Macedonia.]\r\n\r\nFor the early history of Macedonia, he seems to have relied mostly on\r\ntwo pupils of Isocrates, Ephorus of Cumae and Theopompus of Chios;\r\nthough the malignity of the latter deprived his authority of much\r\nweight.[94] He also studied the work of Alexander’s friend and victim,\r\nCallisthenes; and vehemently assailed his veracity, as others have\r\ndone. More important to him perhaps were the writings of his own\r\ncontemporaries, the Rhodians Antisthenes and Zeno; though he detects\r\nthem in some inaccuracies, which in the case of Zeno he took the\r\ntrouble to correct: and of Demetrius of Phalerum, whose writings he\r\nseems to have greatly admired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Egypt and Syria.]\r\n\r\nFor the contemporary history of Egypt and Syria he seems to have\r\ntrusted principally to personal inquiry. He expressly (2, 37) declines\r\nentering on the early history of Egypt on the ground of its having been\r\nfully done by others (referring, perhaps, to Herodotus, Manetho, and\r\nPtolemy of Megalopolis). For the Seleucid dynasty of Syria he quotes no\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geography.]\r\n\r\nOn no subject does Polybius seem to have read so widely as on\r\ngeography: doubtless as preparing himself not only for writing, but for\r\nbeing able to travel with the knowledge and intelligence necessary to\r\nenable him to observe rightly. He had studied minutely and criticised\r\nfreely the writings of Dicaearchus, Pytheas, Eudoxus, and Eratosthenes.\r\nHe was quick to detect fallacies in these writers, and to reject their\r\ndogmatising on the possibilities of nature; yet he does not seem to\r\nhave had in an eminent degree the topographical faculty, or the power\r\nof giving a graphic picture of a locality. Modern research has tended\r\nrather to strengthen than weaken our belief in the accuracy of his\r\ndescriptions, as in the case of Carthagena and the site of the battle\r\nof Cannae; still it cannot be asserted that he is to be classed high in\r\nthe list of topographers, whether scientific or picturesque.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Literature.]\r\n\r\nHe appears to have been fairly well acquainted with the poets; but\r\nhis occasions for quoting them, as far as we have his work, are not\r\nvery frequent. He seems to have known his Homer, as every Greek was\r\nbound to do. He quotes the Cypria of Stasinus, who, according to\r\ntradition, was son-in-law of Homer; Hesiod, Simonides of Ceos, Pindar,\r\nEuripides, and Epicharmus of Cos. He quotes or refers to Plato, whom\r\nhe appears chiefly to have studied for his political theories; and\r\ncertain technical writers, such as Aeneas Tacticus, and Cleoxenos and\r\nDemoclitus, inventors of a new system of telegraphy, if they wrote it\r\nrather than taught it practically.\r\n\r\nEven allowing for the loss of so great a part of his work, the list\r\nof authors is not a long one: and it suggests the remark, which his\r\nstyle as well as his own professions tend to confirm, that he was\r\nnot primarily a man of letters, but a man of affairs and action, who\r\nloved the stir of political agitation, and unbent his mind by the\r\nexcitement of travel and the chase. Nothing moves his contempt more\r\nthan the idea of Timaeus living peaceably for fifty years at Athens,\r\nholding aloof from all active life, and poring over the books in\r\nthe Athenian libraries as a preparation for writing history; which,\r\naccording to him, can only be worth reading when it springs, not from\r\nrummaging Record offices, but from taking a personal share in the\r\npolitical strife of the day; studying military tactics in the camp and\r\nfield; witnessing battles; questioning the actors in great events; and\r\nvisiting the sites of battles, the cities and lands which are to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. THE ACHAEAN LEAGUE[95]\r\n\r\nTo the student of politics the history of Greece is chiefly interesting\r\nas offering examples of numerous small states enjoying complete local\r\nautonomy, yet retaining a feeling of a larger nationality founded in a\r\ncommunity of blood, language, and religion; a community, that is, in\r\nthe sense that, fundamentally united in these three particulars, they\r\nyet acknowledged variations even in them, which distinguished without\r\nentirely separating them. From some points of view the experiment may\r\nbe regarded as having been successful. From others it was a signal\r\nfailure. Local jealousies and mutual provocations not only continually\r\nset city against city, clan against clan, but perpetually suggested\r\ninvitations sent by one city, or even one party in a city, to foreign\r\npotentates or peoples to interfere in their behalf against another city\r\nor party, which they hated or feared, but were too weak to resist. Thus\r\nwe find the Persians, Macedonians, Syrians, and Romans successively\r\ninduced to interfere in Greek politics with the assurance that there\r\nwere always some states, or some party in each state, who would welcome\r\nthem. From time to time men of larger views had conceived the idea of\r\ncreating a united Empire of Hellas, which might present an unbroken\r\nfront to the foreigner. From time to time philosophers had preached the\r\nimpossibility of combining complete local independence with the idea of\r\na strong and vigorous nationality. But the true solution of the problem\r\nhad never been successfully hit upon: and after various abortive\r\nattempts at combination, Greece was left, a helpless collection of\r\ndisjointed fragments, to fall under the intrigues of Macedonia and Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Achaean league was not the first attempt at such a formation;\r\nthough it was the first that ever arrived at anything like a complete\r\nscheme of federalism (unless the Aetolian preceded it); and was in\r\nmany respects a fresh departure in Hellenic policy, and the first\r\nexperiment in federation which seemed to contain the elements of\r\nsuccess. From the earliest times certain Greek states had combined more\r\nor less closely, or loosely, for certain specific purposes. Such were\r\nthe various Amphictyonies, and especially the Amphictyonic league of\r\nThermopylae and Delphi. The object of these was primarily religious:\r\nthe worship of a particular deity, the care of a particular temple; the\r\nfirst condition of membership being therefore community of blood. But\r\nthough this was the origin of their being, there were elements in their\r\nconstitution which might have developed into some form of federalism,\r\nhad it not been for the centrifugal forces that always tended to keep\r\nGreek states apart. Thus we can conceive the idea of the Pylagorae from\r\nthe various states gradually giving rise to the notion of a central\r\nparliament of elected representatives; and the sphere of its activity\r\ngradually extending to matters purely political, beginning with those\r\nwhich were on the borderland of religion and politics. And, indeed,\r\nthe action of the great Amphictyonic league at times seemed to be\r\napproaching this.[96]\r\n\r\nBut the forces tending to decentralisation were always the stronger:\r\nand though the league continued to exist for many centuries, it became\r\nless and less political, and less and less influential in Greece. So\r\ntoo with other combinations in Greece. The community (τὸ κοινὸν) of the\r\nIonians, beginning with a common meeting for worship at the Panionium,\r\non one memorable occasion at least seemed for a brief space to promise\r\nto develop into a federation for mutual succour and defence. In the\r\nIonian revolt in B.C. 500, the deputies (πρόβουλοι) of the Ionian\r\nstates met and determined to combine against the enemy; they even went\r\nso far as to appoint a common general or admiral. But the instinct\r\nof separation was too strong; at the first touch of difficulty and\r\nhardship the union was resolved into its elements.[97]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Boeotian league was somewhat more regular and\r\npermanent. The Boeotarchs appear to have met at regular intervals, and\r\nnow and again to have succeeded in mustering a national levy. There\r\nwere also four regularly constituted “Senates” to control them, though\r\nwe know nothing of their constitution.[98] But the league had come to\r\nnothing; partly from the resistance of the towns to the overweening\r\npretensions of Thebes, and later from the severity of the treatment\r\nexperienced by it at the hands of Alexander and his successors.\r\n\r\nThessaly, again, was a loose confederacy of towns or cantons, in which\r\ncertain great families, such as the Aleuadae and Scopadae, held the\r\ndirection of their local affairs; or some tyrannus, as Alexander of\r\nPherae, obtained sovereign powers. Still, for certain purposes, a\r\nconnexion was acknowledged, and a Tagus of Thessaly was appointed, with\r\nthe power of summoning a general levy of men. For a short time prior\r\nto the Roman conquest these officers appear to have gained additional\r\nimportance; but Thessaly never was united enough to be of importance,\r\nin spite of its famous cavalry, even among Greek nations, far less to\r\nbe capable of presenting a firm front to the foreigner.\r\n\r\nOne other early attempt at forming something like a Panhellenic\r\nunion ought to be noticed. When the Persian invasion of B.C. 480 was\r\nthreatening, deputies (πρόβουλοι) met at the Isthmus, sat there in\r\ncouncil for some months, and endeavoured to unite Greece against the\r\nforeigner.[99] But the one expedition which was sent solely by their\r\ninstigation proved a failure.[100] And when the danger was over,\r\nprincipally by the combined exertion of Athens and Sparta, this council\r\nseems to have died a natural death. Still for a time it acted as a\r\nsupreme parliament of Greece, and assumed the power to punish with fine\r\nor death those Greeks who had medised.[101]\r\n\r\nBesides these rudimentary leagues, which might, but did not, issue\r\nin some form of Panhellenic government, there were periods in Greek\r\nhistory in which the Hegemone of one state did something towards\r\npresenting the appearance of union. Thus Polycrates of Samos seemed\r\nat one time to be likely to succeed in forming a great Ionian Empire.\r\nAnd in continental Greece, before the Persian wars, we find Sparta\r\noccupying the position of an acknowledged court of reference in\r\ninternational questions,[102]—a position in which she probably had been\r\npreceded by Argos. And after those wars, by means of the confederacy\r\nof Delos, formed at first for one specific purpose—that of keeping the\r\nAegean free of the Persians—Athens gradually rose to the position of\r\nan imperial city, claiming active control over the external politics\r\nof a considerable portion of Greece and nearly all the islands (B.C.\r\n478-404). But this proved after all but a passing episode in Greek\r\nhistory. Athens perhaps misused her power; and Sparta took up the\r\ntask with great professions, but in a spirit even less acceptable to\r\nthe Greek world than that of Athens; and by the peace of Antalcidas\r\n(B.C. 387) the issue of the hundred years’ struggle with Persia left\r\none of the fairest portions of Hellas permanently separated from the\r\nmain body. Asiatic Greece never became Hellenic again. The fall of the\r\nPersian empire before the invasion of Alexander for a while reunited it\r\nto a semi-Greek power; but Alexander’s death left it a prey to warring\r\ntyrants. It lost its prosperity and its commerce; and whatever else it\r\nbecame, it was never independent, or really Hellenic again.\r\n\r\nFor a few years more Sparta and then Thebes assumed to be head of\r\nGreece, but the Macedonian supremacy secured at Chaeronea (B.C.\r\n338), still more fully after the abortive Lamian war (B.C. 323),\r\nleft Greece only a nominal freedom, again and again assured to it by\r\nvarious Macedonian monarchs, but really held only on sufferance. The\r\ncountry seemed to settle down without farther struggle into political\r\ninsignificance. The games and festivals went on, and there was still\r\nsome high talk of Hellenic glories. But one after another of the\r\ntowns submitted to receive Macedonian garrisons and governors; and\r\nAthens, once the brilliant leader in national aspirations, practically\r\nabandoned politics, and was content to enjoy a reputation partly\r\nfounded on her past, and partly on the fame of the philosophers who\r\nstill taught in her gardens and porches, and attracted young men from\r\nall parts of the world to listen to their discourses, and to sharpen\r\ntheir wits by the acute if not very useful discussions which they\r\npromoted.[103] Sparta, far from retaining her old ascendency, had been\r\nlosing with it her ancient constitution, which had been the foundation\r\nof her glory, as well perhaps as in some respects the source of her\r\nweakness; and for good or evil had ceased to count for much in Hellenic\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this general collapse two portions of the Hellenic race\r\ngradually formed or recovered some sort of united government, which\r\nenabled them to play a conspicuous part in the later history of Greece,\r\nand which was essentially different from any of the combinations of\r\nearlier times of which I have been speaking. These were the Aetolians\r\nand Achaeans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aetolian league.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the former our information is exceedingly scanty.\r\nThey were said to have been an emigration from Elis originally;[104]\r\nbut they were little known to the rest of Greece. Strange stories\r\nwere told of them, of their savage mode of life, their scarcely\r\nintelligible language, their feeding on raw flesh, and their fierceness\r\nas soldiers. They were said to live in open villages, widely removed\r\nfrom each other, and without effective means of combination for\r\nmutual protection. Their piracies, which were chiefly directed to the\r\ncoasts of Messenia, caused the Messenians to seize the opportunity\r\nof Demosthenes being in their neighbourhood in B.C. 426, with a\r\nconsiderable Athenian army, to persuade him to invade the Aetolians,\r\nwho were always on the look-out to attack Naupactus, a town which the\r\nAthenians had held since B.C. 455,[105] and which was naturally an\r\nobject of envy to them as commanding the entrance to the Corinthian\r\ngulf. But when Demosthenes attempted the invasion, he found to his\r\ncost that the Aetolians knew how to combine, and he had to retire\r\nbeaten with severe loss.[106] The separate tribes in Aetolia seem soon\r\nafterwards to have had, if they had not already, some form of central\r\ngovernment; for we find them negotiating with Agesilaus in B.C. 390,\r\nwith the same object of obtaining Naupactus,[107] when the Athenians\r\nhad lost it, and it had fallen into the hands of the Locrians.[108] The\r\nAetolians appear to have gradually increased in importance: for we find\r\nPhilip making terms with them and giving them the coveted Naupactus in\r\nB.C. 341, which had at some time previous come into the possession of\r\nthe Achaeans.[109] But their most conspicuous achievement, which caused\r\nthem to take a position of importance in Greece, was their brilliant\r\ndefeat of the invading Gauls at Delphi in B.C. 279.[110] By this\r\ntime their federal constitution must in some shape have been formed.\r\nThe people elected a Strategus in a general meeting, usually held at\r\nThermus, at the autumn equinox, to which apparently all Aetolians\r\nwere at liberty to come, and at which questions of peace and war and\r\nexternal politics generally were brought forward; though meanwhile the\r\nStrategus appears to have had the right of declaring and carrying on\r\nwar as he chose. There was also a hipparch and a secretary (21, 32);\r\nand a senate called Apocleti (20, 1); and a body called _Synedri_\r\n(_C. I. G._ 2350), which seem to have been judicial, and another\r\ncalled _Nomographi_ (13, 1, _C. I. G._ 3046), who were apparently an\r\noccasional board for legislation. They produced some writers, but their\r\nworks are lost. Accordingly, as Professor Mahaffy observes, “we know\r\nthem entirely from their enemies.” Still the acknowledged principle on\r\nwhich they acted, ἄγειν λάφυρον ἀπὸ λαφύρου[111]—that is, that where\r\nspoils were going, whether from friend or foe, they were justified in\r\ntaking a part, speaks for itself, and is enough to stamp them as at\r\nleast dangerous and unpleasant neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaean league.]\r\n\r\nThe Achaeans have a different and more interesting history.\r\n\r\nThe original Achaean league consisted of a federation of twelve\r\ncities and their respective territory (μέρος): Pellene, Aegira,\r\nAegae, Bura, Helice, Aegium, Rhypes, Patrae, Pharae, Olenus, Dyme,\r\nTritaea.[112] This league was of great antiquity, but we know nothing\r\nof its history, or how it differed from other leagues, such as I have\r\nalready mentioned, in adding political to religious unity. In B.C.\r\n454 it submitted to Athens; but was restored to its original position\r\nin the same year on the signing of the thirty years’ truce between\r\nSparta and Athens;[113] and though the Athenians demanded that their\r\nauthority over it should be restored to them in B.C. 425, when they\r\nhad caught the Spartan army at Sphacteria, no change appears to have\r\nbeen made.[114] Thucydides certainly seems to speak of it, not as\r\nentirely free, but as in some special manner subject to the supremacy\r\nof Sparta. Polybius, however, claims for them, at an early period, a\r\npeculiar and honourable place in Greek politics, as being distinguished\r\nfor probity and honour. Thus they were chosen as arbitrators in the\r\nintestine of Magna Graecia (about B.C. 400-390); and again, after the\r\nbattle of Leuctra (B.C. 371) to mediate between Sparta and Thebes.[115]\r\nThey must therefore, between B.C. 425-390, have obtained a virtual\r\nindependence. They shared, however, in the universal decline of\r\nHellenic activity during the Macedonian period (B.C. 359 to about B.C.\r\n285), and Polybius complains that they were systematically depressed\r\nby the intrigues of Sparta and Macedonia; both which powers took care\r\nto prevent any Achaean of promising ability from attaining influence\r\nin the Peloponnese.[116] The same influence was exerted to estrange\r\nthe Achaean cities from each other. They were garrisoned by Macedonian\r\ntroops, or fell under the power of tyrants; and to all appearance the\r\nleague had fared as other such combinations had fared before, and had\r\nbeen resolved into its original elements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revival of the league, B.C. 284-280.]\r\n\r\nBut the tradition of the old union did not die out entirely. Eight\r\nof the old cities still existed in a state of more or less vigour.\r\nOlenus and Helice had long ago disappeared by encroachments of the sea\r\n(before B.C. 371), and their places had not been filled up by others.\r\nTwo other towns, Rhypes and Aegae, had from various causes ceased to be\r\ninhabited, and their places had been taken in the league (before the\r\ndissolution) by Leontium and Caryneia. There were therefore ten cities\r\nwhich had once known the advantages and disadvantages of some sort of\r\nfederal union; as well as the misfortunes which attached to disunion,\r\naggravated by constant interference from without.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 284. First union of Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, Pharae.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adherence of Aegium, B.C. 279.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 279-255.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Margos of Caryneia first sole Strategus, B.C. 255.]\r\n\r\nThe first step in an attempt to resuscitate the league was taken in\r\nthe 124th Olympiad (B.C. 284-280). Macedonia was at the time weakened\r\nby the troubles of a disputed succession: Pyrrhus was absorbed in\r\nhis futile Italian expedition: a change in the sovereign of Egypt\r\nopened a way to a possible change of policy at Alexandria: and the\r\ndeath of Lysimachus gave the monarchs something else to do than to\r\ntrouble themselves about the Peloponnese. At this period four of the\r\nAchaean towns, Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, and Pharae, formed a league\r\nfor mutual help. This proving, after a trial of five years, to have\r\nsome stability, it was joined by Aegium, from which the Macedonian\r\ngarrison was expelled. At intervals, of which we are not informed, this\r\nwas again joined by Bura and Caryneia. These seven cities continued\r\nto constitute the entire league for twenty-five years; the federal\r\nmagistrates consisting of two Strategi, elected by each city in turns,\r\nand a secretary. As to the doings of the league during this period\r\nwe are entirely in the dark. The next step that we hear of is the\r\nabolition of the dual presidency and the election of Margos of Caryneia\r\nas sole Strategus. We are not told the reasons of the change; but it\r\nis clear that a divided command might often give room for delay, when\r\ndelay was fatal; and for the conflict of local interests, where the\r\ninterests of the community should be the paramount consideration. At\r\nany rate the change was made: and Margos, who had been a loyal servant\r\nof the league, was the first sole Strategus. His immediate successors\r\nwe do not know. The next fact in the history of the league was the\r\nadherence of Sicyon, a powerful town and the first of any, not in the\r\nnumber of the old Achaean federation, to join. This therefore was\r\na great step in the direction of extending the federation over the\r\nPeloponnese; and it was the work of the man destined to do much in\r\nmoulding the league into the shape in which it attained its greatest\r\neffectiveness, Aratus of Sicyon. He found it weak; its cities poor\r\nand insignificant; with no aid from rich soil or good harbourage to\r\nincrease its wealth or property;[117] he left it, not indeed free\r\nfrom serious dangers and difficulties,—in part the result of his own\r\npolicy in calling in the aid of the Macedonians, in part created by\r\nthe persistent hostility of Aetolia and Sparta,—but yet possessed of\r\ngreat vitality, and fast becoming the most powerful and influential of\r\nall the Greek governments; although at no time can it be spoken of as\r\nPanhellenic without very considerable exaggeration. Aratus had been\r\nbrought up in exile at Argos, after the murder of his father Cleinias\r\n(B.C. 271); and, when twenty years of age, by a gallant and romantic\r\nadventure, had driven out the tyrant Nicocles from Sicyon (B.C. 251).\r\nHe became the chief magistrate of his native town, which he induced to\r\njoin the Achaean league, thus causing, as I have said, the league to\r\ntake its first step towards embracing all the Peloponnese. It seems\r\nthat for five years Aratus remained chief magistrate of Sicyon, but\r\na private citizen of the league. In B.C. 245 (though of the exact\r\nyear we have no positive information), he appears to have been first\r\nelected Strategus of the league. But it was not until his second year\r\nof office, B.C. 243-242, that he began putting in practice the policy\r\nwhich he proposed to himself,—the expulsion of the Macedonian garrisons\r\nand the despots from the cities of the Peloponnese, with the view of\r\ntheir joining the league. He began with the Acrocorinthus. Corinth,\r\nfreed from the foreign garrison, joined the league, and was followed\r\nsoon after by Megara[118] (B.C. 240). From this time Aratus was\r\nStrategus of the league in alternate years to the time of his death,\r\nthe federal law not allowing two consecutive years of office.[119]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenic war, B.C. 227-221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 226-221.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Antigonus Gonatas (B.C. 239) led to a new departure.\r\nHitherto the Aetolians had been in league with the Macedonians to\r\nvex and harry the Achaeans. The two leagues now made peace, and\r\nthe Aetolians aided the Achaeans in their resistance to Gonatas’s\r\nsuccessor, Demetrius (B.C. 239-229). Still the despots in many of the\r\nPeloponnesian towns held out, trusting to the support of Demetrius.\r\nWhen he died (B.C. 229) there was a general movement among them to\r\nabdicate and join their cities to the league. Lydiades of Megalopolis\r\nhad done so during Demetrius’s lifetime; and now Aristomachus of Argos,\r\nXeno of Hermione, and Cleonymus of Phlius did the same. The rapid\r\nextension of the Achaean league, however, could not fail to excite the\r\njealousy of the Aetolians, to whose league belonged certain Arcadian\r\ncities such as Mantinea, Tegea, and Orchomenus. These they imagined to\r\nbe threatened by the policy of Aratus, which was apt to proceed on the\r\nline that even a forcible attachment of a Peloponnesian town to the\r\nleague was in reality a liberation of its people from a constraining\r\npower. The Spartan jealousy was aroused by the same fear. And then, as\r\nPolybius puts it, the Aetolians connived at the extension of Spartan\r\npower, even at the expense of cities in league with themselves, in\r\norder to strengthen Cleomenes in his attitude of opposition to the\r\nAchaeans.[120] Aratus, however, resolved to wait for some definite act\r\nof hostility before moving. This was supplied by Cleomenes building\r\na fort (the Athenaeum) at Belbina, in the territory of Megalopolis,\r\na league city. Upon this the league necessarily proclaimed war with\r\nSparta. Thus does Polybius, a warm friend of the league, state the case\r\nin its behalf. The league, he argues, had been growing by the voluntary\r\nadherence of independent towns: it had shown no sign of an intention\r\nto attack Laconian territory, or towns in league with Aetolia: while\r\nCleomenes had committed an act of wanton aggression and provocation\r\nby building a hostile fort in its territory. But what the other side\r\nhad to say may be gathered from Plutarch’s life of Cleomenes, founded\r\nprincipally on the work of Phylarchus the panegyrist of Cleomenes.[121]\r\nHere the case is put very differently. Aratus, according to him, had\r\nmade up his mind that a union of the Peloponnesus was the one thing\r\nnecessary for the safety of the league. In a great measure he had been\r\nalready successful; but the parts which still stood aloof were Elis,\r\nLaconia, and the cities of Arcadia which were under the influence of\r\nSparta.[122] He therefore harassed these last by every means in his\r\npower; and the erection or fortification of the Athenaeum at Belbina\r\nby Cleomenes was in truth only a measure of necessary defence. Aratus,\r\nindeed, held that some of these Arcadian cities had been unfairly\r\nseized by Cleomenes, with the connivance of the Aetolians;[123] but to\r\nthis Cleomenes might reply that, if the league claimed the right of\r\nextending its connexion with the assent, often extorted, of the various\r\ncities annexed, the same right could not justly be denied to himself.\r\nA series of military operations took place during the next five years,\r\nin which Cleomenes nearly always got the better of Aratus; who, able\r\nand courageous in plots and surprises, was timid and ineffective in\r\nthe field. The one important blow struck by Aratus, that of seizing\r\nMantinea, was afterwards nullified by a counter-occupation of it by\r\nthe Lacedaemonians; and in spite of troubles at home, caused by his\r\ngreat scheme of reform, Cleomenes was by B.C. 224 in so superior a\r\nposition that he could with dignity propose terms to the league. He\r\nasked to be elected Strategus, therefore.[124] At first sight this\r\nseemed a means of effecting the desired union of the Peloponnese; and\r\nas such the Achaeans were inclined to accept the proposal. Aratus,\r\nhowever, exerted all his influence to defeat the measure: and, in\r\nspite of all his failures, his services to the league enabled him to\r\nconvince his countrymen that they should reject the offer; and he was\r\nhimself elected Strategus for the twelfth time in the spring of B.C.\r\n223. Aratus has been loudly condemned for allowing a selfish jealousy\r\nto override his care for the true interests of his country, in thus\r\nrefusing a prospect of a united Achaia, in which some one besides\r\nhimself should be the leading man.[125] But I think there is something\r\nto be said on the other side. What Aratus had been working for with a\r\npassionate eagerness was a union of free democratic states. Cleomenes,\r\nin spite of his liberal reforms at home, was a Spartan to the back\r\nbone. Aratus would have no manner of doubt that a league, with Sparta\r\nsupreme in it, would inevitably become a Spartan kingdom. The forces\r\nof Sparta would be used to crush dissenting cities; and soon to put\r\ndown the free institution which would always be disliked and feared\r\nby the Spartan government. Security from Macedonian influence, if it\r\nwere really obtained,—and that was far from certain,—would be dearly\r\npurchased at the price of submission to Spartan tyranny, which would\r\nbe more galling and oppressive in proportion as it was nearer and\r\nmore unremitting. With these views Aratus began to turn his eyes to\r\nthe Macedonian court, as the only possible means of resisting the\r\nencroaching policy of Cleomenes. The character of Antigonus Doson, who\r\nwas then administering Macedonia, gave some encouragement to hope for\r\nhonest and honourable conduct on his part; and after some hesitation\r\nAratus took the final step of asking for his aid.[126] I do not expect\r\nto carry the assent of many readers when I express the opinion that\r\nhe was right; and that the Greek policy towards Macedonia had been\r\nfrom the first a grievous error,—fostered originally by the patriotic\r\neloquence of Demosthenes, and continued ever since by that ineradicable\r\nsentiment for local autonomy which makes Greek history so interesting,\r\nbut inevitably tended to the political annihilation of Greece. Had some\r\n_modus vivendi_ been found with the series of very able sovereigns who\r\nruled Macedonia, a strong Greek nation might have been the result,\r\nwith a central government able to hold its own even in the face of\r\nthe great “cloud in the West,” which was surely overshadowing Greek\r\nfreedom. But this was not to be. The taste for local freedom was too\r\nstrong; and showed itself by constant appeals to an outside power\r\nagainst neighbours, which yet the very men who appealed to it would not\r\nrecognise or obey. The Greeks had to learn that nations cannot, any\r\nmore than individuals, eat their cake and have it too. Local autonomy,\r\nand the complete liberty of every state to war with its neighbours as\r\nit chooses, and of every one to speak and act as he pleases, have their\r\ncharms; but they are not compatible with a united resistance to a great\r\ncentralised and law-abiding power. And all the eloquence of all the\r\nGreek orators rolled into one could not make up for the lack of unity,\r\nor enable the distracted Greeks to raise an army which might stand\r\nbefore a volley of Roman pila or a charge of Roman legionaries.\r\n\r\nThe help asked of Antigonus Doson was given with fatal readiness; but\r\nit had to be purchased by the admission of a Macedonian garrison into\r\nthe Acrocorinthus, one of those “fetters of Greece,” the recovery of\r\nwhich had been among Aratus’s earliest and most glorious triumphs.\r\nThe battle of Sellasia (B.C. 221) settled the question of Spartan\r\ninfluence. Cleomenes fled to Alexandria and never returned. Sparta was\r\nnot enslaved by Antigonus; who on the contrary professed to restore her\r\nancient constitution,—probably meaning that the Ephoralty destroyed\r\nby Cleomenes was to be reconstituted, and the exiles banished by him\r\nrecalled. Practically she was left a prey to a series of unscrupulous\r\ntyrants who one after the other managed to obtain absolute power,\r\nLycurgus (B.C. 220-210), Machanidas, B.C. 210-207; Nabis, B.C. 207-192;\r\nwho, though differing in their home administrations, all agreed in\r\nusing the enmity of the Aetolians in order to harass and oppress the\r\nAchaeans in every possible way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 213. Death of Aratus.]\r\n\r\nAratus died in B.C. 213. The last seven years of his life were\r\nembittered by much ill success in his struggles with the Aetolians;\r\nand by seeing Philip V., of whose presence in the Peloponnese he was\r\nthe main cause, after rendering some brilliant services to the league,\r\nboth in the Peloponnese and the invasion of Aetolia, develop some of\r\nthe worst vices of the tyrant; and he believed himself, whether rightly\r\nor wrongly, to be poisoned by Philip’s order: “This is the reward,” he\r\nsaid to an attendant when he felt himself dying, “of my friendship for\r\nPhilip.”[127]\r\n\r\nThe history of the league after his death followed the same course for\r\nsome years. The war with the Aetolians went on, sometimes slackly,\r\nsometimes vigorously, as Philip V. was or was not diverted by\r\ncontests with his barbarian neighbours, or by schemes for joining the\r\nCarthaginian assaults upon the Roman power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 208-183, Philopoemen.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 193.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 195-194.]\r\n\r\nThe next phase of vigorous action on the part of the league is that\r\nwhich corresponds with the career of Philopoemen, who had already\r\nshown his energy and skill at the battle of Sellasia. He was elected\r\nHipparch in B.C. 210, and Strategus in B.C. 209. In his first office\r\nhe did much to reorganise the Achaean cavalry and restore them to\r\nsome discipline,[128] and he extended this as Strategus to the whole\r\narmy.[129] His life’s work, however, was the defeating and either\r\nkilling or confining to their frontier the tyrants of Sparta. But while\r\nhe was absent from the country after B.C. 200 a new element appeared in\r\nthe Peloponnese. In 197 the battle of Cynoscephalae put an end for ever\r\nto Macedonian influence, and Flamininus proclaimed the liberty of all\r\nGreece in B.C. 195 at the Nemean festival. But Nabis was not deposed;\r\nhe was secured in his power by a treaty with Rome; and when Philopoemen\r\nreturned from Crete (B.C. 193), he found a fresh war on the point of\r\nbreaking out owing to intrigues between that tyrant and the Aetolians.\r\nThey suggested, and he eagerly undertook to make, an attempt to\r\nrecover the maritime towns of which he had been deprived by the Roman\r\nsettlement.[130][Sidenote: 193-192.] Nabis at once attacked Gythium:\r\nand seemed on the point of taking it and the whole of the coast towns,\r\nwhich would thus have been lost to the league. Philopoemen, now again\r\nStrategus (B.C. 192), failed to relieve Gythium; but by a skilful\r\npiece of generalship inflicted so severe a defeat on Nabis, as he was\r\nreturning to Sparta, that he did not venture on further movements\r\nbeyond Laconia; and shortly afterwards was assassinated by some\r\nAetolians whom he had summoned to his aid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 189-187.]\r\n\r\nBut the comparative peace in the Peloponnese was again broken in\r\nB.C. 189 by the Spartans seizing a maritime town called Las; the\r\nobject being to relieve themselves of the restraint which shut them\r\nfrom the sea, and the possible attacks of the exiles who had been\r\nbanished by Nabis, and who were always watching an opportunity to\r\neffect their return. Philopoemen (Strategus both 189 and 188 B.C.)\r\nled an army to the Laconian frontier in the spring of B.C. 188, and\r\nafter the execution of eighty Spartans, who had been surrendered on\r\naccount of the seizure of Las, and of the murder of thirty citizens\r\nwho were supposed to have Achaean proclivities—Sparta submitted to his\r\ndemand to raze the fortifications, dismiss the mercenaries, send away\r\nthe new citizens enrolled by the tyrants, and abolish the Lycurgean\r\nlaws, accepting the Achaean institutions instead. This was afterwards\r\nsupplemented by a demand for the restoration of the exiles banished by\r\nthe tyrants. Such of the new citizens (three thousand) as did not leave\r\nthe country by the day named were seized and sold as slaves.[131]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 188.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 188-183.]\r\n\r\nSparta was now part of the Achaean league, which at this time reached\r\nits highest point of power; and its alliance was solicited by the most\r\npowerful princes of the east. It is this period which Polybius seems to\r\nhave in mind in his description of the league at its best, as embracing\r\nthe whole of the Peloponnese.[132][Sidenote: Lycortas Strategus, B.C.\r\n184-182.] And it was in this third period of the existence of the\r\nrenewed league that his father Lycortas came to the front, and he\r\nhimself at an early age began taking part in politics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 179.]\r\n\r\nBut the terms imposed on Sparta were essentially violent and unjust,\r\nand, as it turned out, impolitic. Cowed into submission, she proved\r\na thorn in the side of the league. The exiles continually appealed\r\nto Rome; and after Philopoemen’s death (B.C. 183) the affairs of the\r\nleague began more and more to come before the Roman Senate. As usual,\r\ntraitors were at hand ready to sell their country for the sake of\r\nthe triumph of their party; and Callicrates, sent to Rome to plead\r\nthe cause of the league,[133] employed the opportunity to support\r\nhimself and his party by advising the Senate to give support to “the\r\nRomanisers” in every state. This Polybius regards as the beginning of\r\nthe decline of the league. And the party of moderation, to which he and\r\nhis father Lycortas belonged, and which wished to assert the dignity\r\nand legal rights of their country while offering no provocation to the\r\nRomans, were eventually included under the sweeping decree which caused\r\nthem, to the number of a thousand, to be deported to Italy. We have\r\nalready seen, in tracing the life of Polybius, how the poor remnants of\r\nthese exiles returned in B.C. 151, embittered against Rome, and having\r\nlearnt nothing and forgotten nothing. And how the old quarrels were\r\nrenewed, until an armed interference of Rome was brought upon them; and\r\nhow the victory of Mummius at Corinth (B.C. 146), and the consequent\r\nsettlement of the commissioners, finally dissolved the league into\r\nseparate cantons, nominally autonomous, but really entirely subject to\r\nRome.[134]\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the league presents many points of interest to the\r\nstudent of politics, and has been elaborately discussed by more than\r\none English scholar. I shall content myself here with pointing out some\r\nof the main features as they are mentioned by Polybius.[135]\r\n\r\nThe league was a federation of free towns, all retaining full local\r\nautonomy of some form or other of democracy, which for certain purposes\r\nwere under federal laws and federal magistrates, elected in a federal\r\nassembly which all citizens of the league towns might if they chose\r\nattend. All towns of the league also used the same standards in coinage\r\nand weights and measures (2, 37). The assembly of the league (σύνοδος)\r\nmet for election of the chief magistrate in May of each year, at first\r\nalways at Aegium, but later at the other towns of the league in turn\r\n(29, 23); and a second time in the autumn.[136] And besides these\r\nannual meetings, the Strategus, acting with his council of magistrates,\r\ncould summon a meeting at any time for three days (_e.g._ at Sicyon,\r\n23, 17); and on one occasion we find the assembly delegating its powers\r\nto the armed levy of league troops, who for the nonce were to act as an\r\nassembly (4, 7). Side by side with this general assembly was a council\r\n(βουλή), the functions and powers of which we cannot clearly ascertain.\r\nIt seems to have acted as representing the general assembly in foreign\r\naffairs (4, 26; 22, 12); and, being a working committee of the whole\r\nassembly, it sometimes happened that when an assembly was summoned on\r\nsome subject which did not rouse popular interest, it practically was\r\nthe assembly (29, 24). Its numbers have been assumed to be one hundred\r\nand twenty, from the fact that Eumenes offered them a present of one\r\nhundred and twenty talents, the interest of which was to pay their\r\nexpenses. But this, after all, is not a certain deduction (22, 10).\r\n\r\nThe officers of the league were: First, a President or Strategus who\r\nkept the seal of the league (4, 7), ordered the levy of federal troops,\r\nand commanded it in the field. He also summoned the assemblies, and\r\nbrought the business to be done before them, which was in the form\r\nof a proposal to be accepted or rejected, not amended. He was not\r\nchairman of the assembly, but like an English minister or a Roman\r\nconsul brought on the proposals. He was assisted by a kind of cabinet\r\nof ten magistrates from the several towns, who were called Demiurgi\r\n(δημιουργοὶ 23, 5).[137] This was their technical name: but Polybius\r\nalso speaks of them under the more general appellation of οἱ ἄρχοντες\r\n(5, 1), οἱ συνάρχοντες (23, 16), αἱ ἀρχαὶ (22, 13), αἱ συναρχίαι (27,\r\n2). Whether the number ten had reference to the ten old towns of the\r\nleague or not, it was not increased with the number of the towns; and,\r\nthough we are not informed how they were elected, it seems reasonable\r\nto suppose that they were freely selected without reference to the\r\ntowns from which they came, as the Strategus himself was. There was\r\nalso a vice-president, or hypo-strategus, whose position was, I think,\r\nwholly military. He did not rule in absence of the Strategus, or\r\nsucceed him in case of death, that being reserved for the Strategus\r\nof the previous year; but he took a certain command in war next the\r\nStrategus (5, 94; 4, 59). Besides these we hear of a Hipparch to\r\ncommand the league cavalry (5, 95; 7, 22), an office which seems to\r\nhave been regarded as stepping-stone to that of Strategus. This proved\r\na bad arrangement, as its holder was tempted to seek popularity by\r\nwinking at derelictions of duty among the cavalry who were voters.[138]\r\nThere was also a Navarch to command the regular squadron of federal\r\nships (5, 94), who does not seem to have been so important a person.\r\nThere are also mentioned certain judges (δίκασται) to administer the\r\nfederal law. We hear of them, however, performing duties closely\r\nbordering on politics; for they decided whether certain honorary\r\ninscriptions, statues, or other marks of respect to king Eumenes should\r\nbe allowed to remain in the Achaean cities (28, 7).\r\n\r\nThe Strategus, on the order of the assembly, raised the federal army\r\n(4, 7). The number of men raised differed according to circumstances.\r\nA fairly full levy seems to have been five thousand infantry and five\r\nhundred cavalry (4, 15). But the league also used mercenaries to a\r\ngreat extent. And we hear of one army which was to consist of eight\r\nthousand mercenary infantry, with five hundred mercenary cavalry; and\r\nin this case the Achaean levy was only to be three thousand infantry,\r\nwith three hundred cavalry (5, 91).\r\n\r\nThe pay of the mercenaries and other league expenses were provided for\r\nby an εἰσφορά or contribution from all the states (5, 31, 91). The\r\ncontributing towns appear to have been able to recover their payments\r\nas an indemnification for damage which the federal forces had failed to\r\navert (4, 60).\r\n\r\nThe regular federal squadron of ships for guarding the sea-coasts\r\nappears to have consisted of ten triremes (2, 9; δεκαναία μακρῶν πλοίων\r\n22, 10).\r\n\r\nSuch was the organisation of the Federal Government. It was in form\r\npurely democratic, all members of thirty years old being eligible for\r\noffice, as well as possessing a vote in the assemblies. But a mass\r\nassembly where the members are widely scattered inevitably becomes\r\noligarchic. Only the well-to-do and the energetic will be able or will\r\ncare to come a long journey to attend. And as the votes in the assembly\r\nwere given by towns, it must often have happened that the votes of many\r\ntowns were decided by a very small number of their citizens who were\r\nthere. No doubt, in times of great excitement, the attendance would be\r\nlarge and the vote a popular one. But the general policy of the league\r\nmust have been directed by a small number of energetic men, who made\r\npolitics their profession and could afford to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ROMAN CAMP FOR TWO LEGIONS\r\n\r\n  CONTAINING 4,068,289 SQUARE FEET\r\n\r\n                    REAR (ἡ ὄπισθεν ἐπιφάνεια).\r\n  +----------------------------    -----------------------------+\r\n  |            200         Porta Praetoria.       200           |\r\n  |            ft.                                ft.           |\r\n  |       +----+--------------+    +---------------+----+       |\r\n  |       |    |      EP      |    |       EP'     |    |       |\r\n  |       | V  +--------------+ 50 +---------------+ V' |       |\r\n  |       |    |      EE      | ft.|       EE'     |    |       |\r\n  |       +----+--------------+    +---------------+----+       |\r\n  |                                                       50    |\r\n  |       +---+--+           +------+           +---+---+ ft.   |\r\n  |       |PE |PP|           |      |           |PP'|PE'|       |\r\n  |       +---+--+     F     |  P*  |     Q     +---+---+       |\r\n  |700    |PE |PP|           |      |           |PP'|PE'|       |\r\n  |ft.    +---+--+           +------+           +---+---+       |\r\n  |                 ......              ......                  |\r\n  |      T-----------------------------------------------T'     |\r\n   Porta                                                   Porta\r\n   Principalis                          100 ft.

The importance and magnitude of the subject.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 219-167.]\r\n\r\n+1.+ Had the praise of History been passed over by former Chroniclers\r\nit would perhaps have been incumbent upon me to urge the choice and\r\nspecial study of records of this sort, as the readiest means men can\r\nhave of correcting their knowledge of the past. But my predecessors\r\nhave not been sparing in this respect. They have all begun and ended,\r\nso to speak, by enlarging on this theme: asserting again and again\r\nthat the study of History is in the truest sense an education, and a\r\ntraining for political life; and that the most instructive, or rather\r\nthe only, method of learning to bear with dignity the vicissitudes\r\nof fortune is to recall the catastrophes of others. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that no one need think it his duty to repeat what has been\r\nsaid by many, and said well. Least of all myself: for the surprising\r\nnature of the events which I have undertaken to relate is in itself\r\nsufficient to challenge and stimulate the attention of every one,\r\nold or young, to the study of my work. Can any one be so indifferent\r\nor idle as not to care to know by what means, and under what kind of\r\npolity, almost the whole inhabited world was conquered and brought\r\nunder the dominion of the single city of Rome, and that too within\r\na period of not quite fifty-three years? Or who again can be so\r\ncompletely absorbed in other subjects of contemplation or study, as to\r\nthink any of them superior in importance to the accurate understanding\r\nof an event for which the past affords no precedent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immensity of the Roman Empire shown by comparison with\r\nPersia, Sparta, Macedonia. 1. Persia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Sparta. B.C. 405-394.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Macedonia.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ We shall best show how marvellous and vast our subject is by\r\ncomparing the most famous Empires which preceded, and which have\r\nbeen the favourite themes of historians, and measuring them with the\r\nsuperior greatness of Rome. There are but three that deserve even to\r\nbe so compared and measured: and they are these. The Persians for a\r\ncertain length of time were possessed of a great empire and dominion.\r\nBut every time they ventured beyond the limits of Asia, they found\r\nnot only their empire, but their own existence also in danger. The\r\nLacedaemonians, after contending for supremacy in Greece for many\r\ngenerations, when they did get it, held it without dispute for barely\r\ntwelve years. The Macedonians obtained dominion in Europe from the\r\nlands bordering on the Adriatic to the Danube,—which after all is but\r\na small fraction of this continent,—and, by the destruction of the\r\nPersian Empire, they afterwards added to that the dominion of Asia. And\r\nyet, though they had the credit of having made themselves masters of a\r\nlarger number of countries and states than any people had ever done,\r\nthey still left the greater half of the inhabited world in the hands of\r\nothers. They never so much as thought of attempting Sicily, Sardinia,\r\nor Libya: and as to Europe, to speak the plain truth, they never even\r\nknew of the most warlike tribes of the West. The Roman conquest, on\r\nthe other hand, was not partial. Nearly the whole inhabited world was\r\nreduced by them to obedience: and they left behind them an empire not\r\nto be paralleled in the past or rivalled in the future. Students will\r\ngain from my narrative a clearer view of the whole story, and of the\r\nnumerous and important advantages which such exact record of events\r\noffers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220-217. The History starts from the 140th Olympiad,\r\nwhen the tendency towards unity first shows itself.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ My History begins in the 140th Olympiad. The events from which it\r\nstarts are these. In Greece, what is called the Social war: the first\r\nwaged by Philip, son of Demetrius and father of Perseus, in league with\r\nthe Achaeans against the Aetolians. In Asia, the war for the possession\r\nof Coele-Syria which Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator carried on\r\nagainst each other. In Italy, Libya, and their neighbourhood, the\r\nconflict between Rome and Carthage, generally called the Hannibalian\r\nwar. My work thus begins where that of Aratus of Sicyon leaves off. Now\r\nup to this time the world’s history had been, so to speak, a series\r\nof disconnected transactions, as widely separated in their origin\r\nand results as in their localities. But from this time forth History\r\nbecomes a connected whole: the affairs of Italy and Libya are involved\r\nwith those of Asia and Greece, and the tendency of all is to unity.\r\nThis is why I have fixed upon this era as the starting-point of my\r\nwork. For it was their victory over the Carthaginians in this war, and\r\ntheir conviction that thereby the most difficult and most essential\r\nstep towards universal empire had been taken, which encouraged the\r\nRomans for the first time to stretch out their hands upon the rest, and\r\nto cross with an army into Greece and Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sketch of their previous history necessary to explain the\r\nsuccess of the Romans.]\r\n\r\nNow, had the states that were rivals for universal empire been\r\nfamiliarly known to us, no reference perhaps to their previous history\r\nwould have been necessary, to show the purpose and the forces with\r\nwhich they approached an undertaking of this nature and magnitude.\r\nBut the fact is that the majority of the Greeks have no knowledge of\r\nthe previous constitution, power, or achievements either of Rome or\r\nCarthage. I therefore concluded that it was necessary to prefix this\r\nand the next book to my History. I was anxious that no one, when fairly\r\nembarked upon my actual narrative, should feel at a loss, and have to\r\nask what were the designs entertained by the Romans, or the forces and\r\nmeans at their disposal, that they entered upon those undertakings,\r\nwhich did in fact lead to their becoming masters of land and sea\r\neverywhere in our part of the world. I wished, on the contrary, that\r\nthese books of mine, and the prefatory sketch which they contained,\r\nmight make it clear that the resources they started with justified\r\ntheir original idea, and sufficiently explained their final success in\r\ngrasping universal empire and dominion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The need of a comprehensive view of history as well as a\r\nclose study of an epoch.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ There is this analogy between the plan of my History and the\r\nmarvellous spirit of the age with which I have to deal. Just as Fortune\r\nmade almost all the affairs of the world incline in one direction,\r\nand forced them to converge upon one and the same point; so it is my\r\ntask as an historian to put before my readers a compendious view of\r\nthe part played by Fortune in bringing about the general catastrophe.\r\nIt was this peculiarity which originally challenged my attention, and\r\ndetermined me on undertaking this work. And combined with this was the\r\nfact that no writer of our time has undertaken a general history. Had\r\nany one done so my ambition in this direction would have been much\r\ndiminished. But, in point of fact, I notice that by far the greater\r\nnumber of historians concern themselves with isolated wars and the\r\nincidents that accompany them: while as to a general and comprehensive\r\nscheme of events, their date, origin, and catastrophe, no one as far\r\nas I know has undertaken to examine it. I thought it, therefore,\r\ndistinctly my duty neither to pass by myself, nor allow any one else to\r\npass by, without full study, a characteristic specimen of the dealings\r\nof Fortune at once brilliant and instructive in the highest degree. For\r\nfruitful as Fortune is in change, and constantly as she is producing\r\ndramas in the life of men, yet never assuredly before this did she work\r\nsuch a marvel, or act such a drama, as that which we have witnessed.\r\nAnd of this we cannot obtain a comprehensive view from writers of mere\r\nepisodes. It would be as absurd to expect to do so as for a man to\r\nimagine that he has learnt the shape of the whole world, its entire\r\narrangement and order, because he has visited one after the other the\r\nmost famous cities in it; or perhaps merely examined them in separate\r\npictures. That would be indeed absurd: and it has always seemed to me\r\nthat men, who are persuaded that they get a competent view of universal\r\nfrom episodical history, are very like persons who should see the limbs\r\nof some body, which had once been living and beautiful, scattered\r\nand remote; and should imagine that to be quite as good as actually\r\nbeholding the activity and beauty of the living creature itself. But\r\nif some one could there and then reconstruct the animal once more, in\r\nthe perfection of its beauty and the charm of its vitality, and could\r\ndisplay it to the same people, they would beyond doubt confess that\r\nthey had been far from conceiving the truth, and had been little better\r\nthan dreamers. For indeed some idea of a whole may be got from a part,\r\nbut an accurate knowledge and clear comprehension cannot. Wherefore we\r\nmust conclude that episodical history contributes exceedingly little to\r\nthe familiar knowledge and secure grasp of universal history. While it\r\nis only by the combination and comparison of the separate parts of the\r\nwhole,—by observing their likeness and their difference,—that a man can\r\nattain his object: can obtain a view at once clear and complete; and\r\nthus secure both the profit and the delight of History.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 264-261. I begin my preliminary account in the 129th\r\nOlympiad, and with the circumstances which took the Romans to Sicily.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ I shall adopt as the starting-point of this book the first\r\noccasion on which the Romans crossed the sea from Italy. This is just\r\nwhere the History of Timaeus left off; and it falls in the 129th\r\nOlympiad. I shall accordingly have to describe what the state of their\r\naffairs in Italy was, how long that settlement had lasted, and on what\r\nresources they reckoned, when they resolved to invade Sicily. For this\r\nwas the first place outside Italy in which they set foot. The precise\r\ncause of their thus crossing I must state without comment; for if I let\r\none cause lead me back to another, my point of departure will always\r\nelude my grasp, and I shall never arrive at the view of my subject\r\nwhich I wish to present. As to dates, then, I must fix on some era\r\nagreed upon and recognised by all: and as to events, one that admits\r\nof distinctly separate treatment; even though I may be obliged to go\r\nback some short way in point of time, and take a summary review of the\r\nintermediate transactions. For if the facts with which one starts are\r\nunknown, or even open to controversy, all that comes after will fail\r\nof approval and belief. But opinion being once formed on that point,\r\nand a general assent obtained, all the succeeding narrative becomes\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 387-386. The rise of the Roman dominion may be traced\r\nfrom the retirement of the Gauls from the city. From that time one\r\nnation after another in Italy fell into their hands.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Latini.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Etruscans, Gauls, and Samnites.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pyrrhus, B.C. 280.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Southern Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pyrrhus finally quits Italy, B.C. 274.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ It was in the nineteenth year after the sea-fight at Aegospotami,\r\nand the sixteenth before the battle at Leuctra; the year in which the\r\nLacedaemonians made what is called the Peace of Antalcidas with the\r\nKing of Persia; the year in which the elder Dionysius was besieging\r\nRhegium after beating the Italian Greeks on the River Elleporus; and\r\nin which the Gauls took Rome itself by storm and were occupying the\r\nwhole of it except the Capitol. With these Gauls the Romans made a\r\ntreaty and settlement which they were content to accept: and having\r\nthus become beyond all expectation once more masters of their own\r\ncountry, they made a start in their career of expansion; and in the\r\nsucceeding period engaged in various wars with their neighbours. First,\r\nby dint of valour, and the good fortune which attended them in the\r\nfield, they mastered all the Latini; then they went to war with the\r\nEtruscans; then with the Celts; and next with the Samnites, who lived\r\non the eastern and northern frontiers of Latium. Some time after this\r\nthe Tarentines insulted the ambassadors of Rome, and, in fear of the\r\nconsequences, invited and obtained the assistance of Pyrrhus. This\r\nhappened in the year before the Gauls invaded Greece, some of whom\r\nperished near Delphi, while others crossed into Asia. Then it was that\r\nthe Romans—having reduced the Etruscans and Samnites to obedience,\r\nand conquered the Italian Celts in many battles—attempted for the\r\nfirst time the reduction of the rest of Italy. The nations for whose\r\npossessions they were about to fight they affected to regard, not in\r\nthe light of foreigners, but as already for the most part belonging and\r\npertaining to themselves. The experience gained from their contests\r\nwith the Samnites and the Celts had served as a genuine training in the\r\nart of war. Accordingly, they entered upon the war with spirit, drove\r\nPyrrhus from Italy, and then undertook to fight with and subdue those\r\nwho had taken part with him. They succeeded everywhere to a marvel, and\r\nreduced to obedience all the tribes inhabiting Italy except the Celts;\r\nafter which they undertook to besiege some of their own citizens, who\r\nat that time were occupying Rhegium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story of the Mamertines at Messene, and the Roman\r\ngarrison at Rhegium, Dio. Cassius _fr._]\r\n\r\n+7.+ For misfortunes befell Messene and Rhegium, the cities built on\r\neither side of the Strait, peculiar in their nature and alike in their\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. Messene.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agathocles died, B.C. 289]\r\n\r\nNot long before the period we are now describing some Campanian\r\nmercenaries of Agathocles, having for some time cast greedy eyes upon\r\nMessene, owing to its beauty and wealth, no sooner got an opportunity\r\nthan they made a treacherous attempt upon that city. They entered the\r\ntown under guise of friendship, and, having once got possession of\r\nit, they drove out some of the citizens and put others to the sword.\r\nThis done, they seized promiscuously the wives and children of the\r\ndispossessed citizens, each keeping those which fortune had assigned\r\nhim at the very moment of the lawless deed. All other property and the\r\nland they took possession of by a subsequent division and retained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Rhegium, Livy Ep. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pyrrhus in Sicily, B.C. 278-275.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 271. C. Quintus Claudius, L. Genucius Clepsina, Coss.]\r\n\r\nThe speed with which they became masters of a fair territory and\r\ncity found ready imitators of their conduct. The people of Rhegium,\r\nwhen Pyrrhus was crossing to Italy, felt a double anxiety. They\r\nwere dismayed at the thought of his approach, and at the same time\r\nwere afraid of the Carthaginians as being masters of the sea. They\r\naccordingly asked and obtained a force from Rome to guard and support\r\nthem. The garrison, four thousand in number, under the command of a\r\nCampanian named Decius Jubellius, entered the city, and for a time\r\npreserved it, as well as their own faith. But at last, conceiving the\r\nidea of imitating the Mamertines, and having at the same time obtained\r\ntheir co-operation, they broke faith with the people of Rhegium,\r\nenamoured of the pleasant site of the town and the private wealth of\r\nthe citizens, and seized the city after having, in imitation of the\r\nMamertines, first driven out some of the people and put others to the\r\nsword. Now, though the Romans were much annoyed at this transaction,\r\nthey could take no active steps, because they were deeply engaged\r\nin the wars I have mentioned above. But having got free from them\r\nthey invested and besieged the troops. They presently took the place\r\nand killed the greater number in the assault,—for the men resisted\r\ndesperately, knowing what must follow,—but took more than three hundred\r\nalive. These were sent to Rome, and there the Consuls brought them into\r\nthe forum, where they were scourged and beheaded according to custom:\r\nfor they wished as far as they could to vindicate their good faith in\r\nthe eyes of the allies. The territory and town they at once handed over\r\nto the people of Rhegium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the fall of the rebellious garrison of Rhegium on\r\nthe Mamertines.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ But the Mamertines (for this was the name which the Campanians\r\ngave themselves after they became masters of Messene), as long as\r\nthey enjoyed the alliance of the Roman captors of Rhegium, not\r\nonly exercised absolute control over their own town and district\r\nundisturbed, but about the neighbouring territory also gave no little\r\ntrouble to the Carthaginians and Syracusans, and levied tribute from\r\nmany parts of Sicily. But when they were deprived of this support,\r\nthe captors of Rhegium being now invested and besieged, they were\r\nthemselves promptly forced back into the town again by the Syracusans,\r\nunder circumstances which I will now detail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rise of Hiero. He is elected General by the army, B.C.\r\n275-274.]\r\n\r\nNot long before this the military forces of the Syracusans had\r\nquarrelled with the citizens, and while stationed near Merganè elected\r\ncommanders from their own body. These were Artemidorus and Hiero, the\r\nlatter of whom afterwards became King of Syracuse. At this time he was\r\nquite a young man, but had a certain natural aptitude for kingcraft\r\nand the politic conduct of affairs. Having taken over the command,\r\nand having by means of some of his connexions made his way into the\r\ncity, he got his political opponents into his hands; but conducted\r\nthe government with such mildness, and in so lofty a spirit, that the\r\nSyracusans, though by no means usually acquiescing in the election of\r\nofficers by the soldiers, did on this occasion unanimously approve\r\nof Hiero as their general. His first step made it evident to close\r\nobservers that his hopes soared above the position of a mere general.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Secures support of Leptines by marrying his daughter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His device for getting rid of mutinous mercenaries.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiume Salso.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hiero next attacks the Mamertines and defeats them near\r\nMylae, B.C. 268.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ He noticed that among the Syracusans the despatch of troops,\r\nand of magistrates in command of them, was always the signal for\r\nrevolutionary movements of some sort or another. He knew, too, that\r\nof all the citizens Leptines enjoyed the highest position and credit,\r\nand that among the common people especially he was by far the most\r\ninfluential man existing. He accordingly contracted a relationship by\r\nmarriage with him, that he might have a representative of his interests\r\nleft at home at such times as he should be himself bound to go abroad\r\nwith the troops for a campaign. After marrying the daughter of this\r\nman, his next step was in regard to the old mercenaries. He observed\r\nthat they were disaffected and mutinous: and he accordingly led out an\r\nexpedition, with the ostensible purpose of attacking the foreigners\r\nwho were in occupation of Messene. He pitched a camp against the enemy\r\nnear Centuripa, and drew up his line resting on the River Cyamosorus.\r\nBut the cavalry and infantry, which consisted of citizens, he kept\r\ntogether under his personal command at some distance, on pretence of\r\nintending to attack the enemy on another quarter: the mercenaries he\r\nthrust to the front and allowed them to be completely cut to pieces by\r\nthe foreigners; while he seized the moment of their rout to affect a\r\nsafe retreat for himself and the citizens into Syracuse. This stroke of\r\npolicy was skilful and successful. He had got rid of the mutinous and\r\nseditious element in the army; and after enlisting on his own account a\r\nsufficient body of mercenaries, he thenceforth carried on the business\r\nof the government in security. But seeing that the Mamertines were\r\nencouraged by their success to greater confidence and recklessness in\r\ntheir excursions, he fully armed and energetically drilled the citizen\r\nlevies, led them out, and engaged the enemy on the Mylaean plain near\r\nthe River Longanus. He inflicted a severe defeat upon them: took their\r\nleaders prisoners: put a complete end to their audacious proceedings:\r\nand on his return to Syracuse was himself greeted by all the allies\r\nwith the title of King.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some of the conquered Mamertines appeal to Rome for help.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The motives of the Romans in acceding to this\r\nprayer,—jealousy of the growing power of Carthage.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ Thus were the Mamertines first deprived of support from\r\nRhegium, and then subjected, from causes which I have just stated,\r\nto a complete defeat on their own account. Thereupon some of them\r\nbetook themselves to the protection of the Carthaginians, and were\r\nfor putting themselves and their citadel into their hands; while\r\nothers set about sending an embassy to Rome to offer a surrender of\r\ntheir city, and to beg assistance on the ground of the ties of race\r\nwhich united them. The Romans were long in doubt. The inconsistency\r\nof sending such aid seemed manifest. A little while ago they had put\r\nsome of their own citizens to death, with the extreme penalties of\r\nthe law, for having broken faith with the people of Rhegium: and now\r\nso soon afterwards to assist the Mamertines, who had done precisely\r\nthe same to Messene as well as Rhegium, involved a breach of equity\r\nvery hard to justify. But while fully alive to these points, they yet\r\nsaw that Carthaginian aggrandisement was not confined to Libya, but\r\nhad embraced many districts in Iberia as well; and that Carthage was,\r\nbesides, mistress of all the islands in the Sardinian and Tyrrhenian\r\nseas: they were beginning, therefore, to be exceedingly anxious lest,\r\nif the Carthaginians became masters of Sicily also, they should find\r\nthem very dangerous and formidable neighbours, surrounding them as\r\nthey would on every side, and occupying a position which commanded all\r\nthe coasts of Italy. Now it was clear that, if the Mamertines did not\r\nobtain the assistance they asked for, the Carthaginians would very\r\nsoon reduce Sicily. For should they avail themselves of the voluntary\r\noffer of Messene and become masters of it, they were certain before\r\nlong to crush Syracuse also, since they were already lords of nearly\r\nthe whole of the rest of Sicily. The Romans saw all this, and felt\r\nthat it was absolutely necessary not to let Messene slip, or allow the\r\nCarthaginians to secure what would be like a bridge to enable them to\r\ncross into Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate shirk the responsibility of decision. The people\r\nvote for helping the Mamertines.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 264. Appius Claudius Caudex. M. Fulvius Flaccus, Coss.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hiero joins Carthage in laying siege to the Mamertines in\r\nMessene. Appius comes to the relief of the besieged, B.C. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After vain attempts at negotiation, Appius determines to\r\nattack Hiero.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hiero is defeated, and returns to Syracuse.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ In spite of protracted deliberations, the conflict of motives\r\nproved too strong, after all, to allow of the Senate coming to any\r\ndecision; for the inconsistency of aiding the Messenians appeared to\r\nthem to be evenly balanced by the advantages to be gained by doing so.\r\nThe people, however, had suffered much from the previous wars, and\r\nwanted some means of repairing the losses which they had sustained\r\nin every department. Besides these national advantages to be gained\r\nby the war, the military commanders suggested that individually they\r\nwould get manifest and important benefits from it. They accordingly\r\nvoted in favour of giving the aid. The decree having thus been passed\r\nby the people, they elected one of the consuls, Appius Claudius, to\r\nthe command, and sent him out with instructions to cross to Messene\r\nand relieve the Mamertines. These latter managed, between threats and\r\nfalse representations, to oust the Carthaginian commander who was\r\nalready in possession of the citadel, invited Appius in, and offered\r\nto deliver the city into his hands. The Carthaginians crucified their\r\ncommander for what they considered to be his cowardice and folly in\r\nthus losing the citadel; stationed their fleet near Pelorus; their land\r\nforces at a place called Synes; and laid vigorous siege to Messene.\r\nNow at this juncture Hiero, thinking it a favourable opportunity for\r\ntotally expelling from Sicily the foreigners who were in occupation of\r\nMessene, made a treaty with the Carthaginians. Having done this, he\r\nstarted from Syracuse upon an expedition against that city. He pitched\r\nhis camp on the opposite side to the Carthaginians, near what was\r\ncalled the Chalcidian Mount, whereby the garrison were cut off from\r\nthat way out as well as from the other. The Roman Consul Appius, for\r\nhis part, gallantly crossed the strait by night and got into Messene.\r\nBut he found that the enemy had completely surrounded the town and were\r\nvigorously pressing on the attack; and he concluded on reflection that\r\nthe siege could bring him neither credit nor security so long as the\r\nenemy commanded land as well as sea. He accordingly first endeavoured\r\nto relieve the Mamertines from the contest altogether by sending\r\nembassies to both of the attacking forces. Neither of them received\r\nhis proposals, and at last, from sheer necessity, he made up his mind\r\nto hazard an engagement, and that he would begin with the Syracusans.\r\nSo he led out his forces and drew them up for the fight: nor was\r\nthe Syracusan backward in accepting the challenge, but descended\r\nsimultaneously to give him battle. After a prolonged struggle, Appius\r\ngot the better of the enemy, and chased the opposing forces right up\r\nto their entrenchments. The result of this was that Appius, after\r\nstripping the dead, retired into Messene again, while Hiero, with a\r\nforeboding of the final result, only waited for nightfall to beat a\r\nhasty retreat to Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Encouraged by this success, he attacks and drives off the\r\nCarthaginians.]\r\n\r\n+12.+ Next morning, when Appius was assured of their flight, his\r\nconfidence was strengthened, and he made up his mind to attack the\r\nCarthaginians without delay. Accordingly, he issued orders to the\r\nsoldiers to despatch their preparations early, and at daybreak\r\ncommenced his sally. Having succeeded in engaging the enemy, he killed\r\na large number of them, and forced the rest to fly precipitately to\r\nthe neighbouring towns. These successes sufficed to raise the siege\r\nof Messene: and thenceforth he scoured the territory of Syracuse and\r\nher allies with impunity, and laid it waste without finding any one to\r\ndispute the possession of the open country with him; and finally he sat\r\ndown before Syracuse itself and laid siege to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Such preliminary sketches are necessary for clearness, and\r\nmy readers must not be surprised if I follow the same system in the\r\ncase of other towns.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature and motive of the first warlike expedition of\r\nthe Romans beyond the shores of Italy; and this was the period at\r\nwhich it took place. I thought this expedition the most suitable\r\nstarting-point for my whole narrative, and accordingly adopted it as\r\na basis; though I have made a rapid survey of some anterior events,\r\nthat in setting forth its causes no point should be left obscure. I\r\nthought it necessary, if we were to get an adequate and comprehensive\r\nview of their present supreme position, to trace clearly how and when\r\nthe Romans, after the disaster which they sustained in the loss of\r\ntheir own city, began their upward career; and how and when, once\r\nmore, after possessing themselves of Italy, they conceived the idea of\r\nattempting conquests external to it. This must account in future parts\r\nof my work for my taking, when treating of the most important states,\r\na preliminary survey of their previous history. In doing so my object\r\nwill be to secure such a vantage-ground as will enable us to see with\r\nclearness from what origin, at what period, and in what circumstances\r\nthey severally started and arrived at their present position. This is\r\nexactly what I have just done with regard to the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subjects of the two first books of the Histories. 1. War\r\nin Sicily or first Punic War, B.C. 264-241. 2.

Cleomenic war, B.C. 227-221.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ It is time to have done with these explanations, and to come to\r\nmy subject, after a brief and summary statement of the events of which\r\nmy introductory books are to treat. Of these the first in order of\r\ntime are those which befell the Romans and Carthaginians in their war\r\nfor the possession of Sicily. Next comes the Libyan or Mercenary war;\r\nimmediately following on which are the Carthaginian achievements in\r\nSpain, first under Hamilcar, and then under Hasdrubal. In the course\r\nof these events, again, occurred the first expedition of the Romans\r\ninto Illyria and the Greek side of Europe; and, besides that, their\r\nstruggles within Italy with the Celts. In Greece at the same time the\r\nwar called after Cleomenes was in full action. With this war I design\r\nto conclude my prefatory sketch and my second book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Punic war deserves more detailed treatment,\r\nas furnishing a better basis for comparing Rome and Carthage than\r\nsubsequent wars.]\r\n\r\nTo enter into minute details of these events is unnecessary, and would\r\nbe of no advantage to my readers. It is not part of my plan to write a\r\nhistory of them: my sole object is to recapitulate them in a summary\r\nmanner by way of introduction to the narrative I have in hand. I will,\r\ntherefore, touch lightly upon the leading events of this period in a\r\ncomprehensive sketch, and will endeavour to make the end of it dovetail\r\nwith the commencement of my main history. In this way the narrative\r\nwill acquire a continuity; and I shall be shown to have had good reason\r\nfor touching on points already treated by others: while by such an\r\narrangement the studiously inclined will find the approach to the story\r\nwhich has to be told made intelligible and easy for them. I shall,\r\nhowever, endeavour to describe with somewhat more care the first war\r\nwhich arose between the Romans and Carthaginians for the possession of\r\nSicily. For it would not be easy to mention any war that lasted longer\r\nthan this one; nor one in which the preparations made were on a larger\r\nscale, or the efforts made more sustained, or the actual engagements\r\nmore numerous, or the reverses sustained on either side more signal.\r\nMoreover, the two states themselves were at the precise period of\r\ntheir history when their institutions were as yet in their original\r\nintegrity, their fortunes still at a moderate level, and their forces\r\non an equal footing. So that those who wish to gain a fair view of the\r\nnational characteristics and resources of the two had better base their\r\ncomparison upon this war rather than upon those which came after.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This is rendered more necessary by the partisan\r\nmisrepresentations of Philinus and Fabius Pictor.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ But it was not these considerations only which induced me to\r\nundertake the history of this war. I was influenced quite as much\r\nby the fact that Philinus and Fabius, who have the reputation of\r\nwriting with the most complete knowledge about it, have given us an\r\ninadequate representation of the truth. Now, judging from their lives\r\nand principles, I do not suppose that these writers have intentionally\r\nstated what was false; but I think that they are much in the same\r\nstate of mind as men in love. Partisanship and complete prepossession\r\nmade Philinus think that all the actions of the Carthaginians were\r\ncharacterised by wisdom, honour, and courage: those of the Romans by\r\nthe reverse. Fabius thought the exact opposite. Now in other relations\r\nof life one would hesitate to exclude such warmth of sentiment: for a\r\ngood man ought to be loyal to his friends and patriotic to his country;\r\nought to be at one with his friends in their hatreds and likings. But\r\ndirectly a man assumes the moral attitude of an historian he ought to\r\nforget all considerations of that kind. There will be many occasions on\r\nwhich he will be bound to speak well of his enemies, and even to praise\r\nthem in the highest terms if the facts demand it: and on the other hand\r\nmany occasions on which it will be his duty to criticise and denounce\r\nhis own side, however dear to him, if their errors of conduct suggest\r\nthat course. For as a living creature is rendered wholly useless if\r\ndeprived of its eyes, so if you take truth from History what is left is\r\nbut an idle unprofitable tale. Therefore, one must not shrink either\r\nfrom blaming one’s friends or praising one’s enemies; nor be afraid\r\nof finding fault with and commending the same persons at different\r\ntimes. For it is impossible that men engaged in public affairs should\r\nalways be right, and unlikely that they should always be wrong. Holding\r\nourselves, therefore, entirely aloof from the actors, we must as\r\nhistorians make statements and pronounce judgment in accordance with\r\nthe actions themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philinus’s misrepresentations.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ The writers whom I have named exemplify the truth of these\r\nremarks. Philinus, for instance, commencing the narrative with his\r\nsecond book, says that the “Carthaginians and Syracusans engaged in\r\nthe war and sat down before Messene; that the Romans arriving by\r\nsea entered the town, and immediately sallied out from it to attack\r\nthe Syracusans; but that after suffering severely in the engagement\r\nthey retired into Messene; and that on a second occasion, having\r\nissued forth to attack the Carthaginians, they not only suffered\r\nseverely but lost a considerable number of their men captured by\r\nthe enemy.” But while making this statement, he represents Hiero as\r\nso destitute of sense as, after this engagement, not only to have\r\npromptly burnt his stockade and tents and fled under cover of night\r\nto Syracuse, but to have abandoned all the forts which had been\r\nestablished to overawe the Messenian territory. Similarly he asserts\r\nthat “the Carthaginians immediately after their battle evacuated their\r\nentrenchment and dispersed into various towns, without venturing any\r\nlonger even to dispute the possession of the open country; and that,\r\naccordingly, their leaders seeing that their troops were utterly\r\ndemoralised determined in consideration not to risk a battle: that the\r\nRomans followed them, and not only laid waste the territory of the\r\nCarthaginians and Syracusans, but actually sat down before Syracuse\r\nitself and began to lay siege to it.” These statements appear to me to\r\nbe full of glaring inconsistency, and to call for no refutation at all.\r\nThe very men whom he describes to begin with as besieging Messene, and\r\nas victorious in the engagements, he afterwards represents as running\r\naway, abandoning the open country, and utterly demoralised: while those\r\nwhom he starts by saying were defeated and besieged, he concludes by\r\ndescribing as engaging in a pursuit, as promptly seizing the open\r\nplaces, and finally as besieging Syracuse. Nothing can reconcile\r\nthese statements. It is impossible. Either his initial statement,\r\nor his account of the subsequent events, must be false. In point of\r\nfact the latter part of his story is the true one. The Syracusans and\r\nCarthaginians _did_ abandon the open country, and the Romans _did_\r\nimmediately afterwards commence a siege of Syracuse and of Echetla,\r\nwhich lies in the district between the Syracusan and Carthaginian\r\npales. For the rest it must necessarily be acknowledged that the\r\nfirst part of his account is false; and that whereas the Romans were\r\nvictorious in the engagements under Messene, they have been represented\r\nby this historian as defeated. Through the whole of this work we shall\r\nfind Philinus acting in a similar spirit: and much the same may be said\r\nof Fabius, as I shall show when the several points arise.\r\n\r\nI have now said what was proper on the subject of this digression.\r\nReturning to the matter in hand I will endeavour by a continuous\r\nnarrative of moderate dimensions to guide my readers to a true\r\nknowledge of this war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 264.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (Continuing from chap. xii.), B.C. 263, Manius Valerius\r\nMaximus, Manius Otacilius Crassus, Coss. The Consuls with four legions\r\nare sent to Sicily. A general move of the Sicilian cities to join them.\r\nHiero submits.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ When news came to Rome of the successes of Appius and his\r\nlegions, the people elected Manius Otacilius and Manius Valerius\r\nConsuls, and despatched their whole army to Sicily, and both Consuls\r\nin command. Now the Romans have in all, as distinct from allies, four\r\nlegions of Roman citizens, which they enrol every year, each of which\r\nconsists of four thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry: and\r\non their arrival most of the cities revolted from Syracuse as well\r\nas from Carthage, and joined the Romans. And when he saw the terror\r\nand dismay of the Sicilians, and compared with them the number and\r\ncrushing strength of the legions of Rome, Hiero began, from a review\r\nof all these points, to conclude that the prospects of the Romans\r\nwere brighter than those of the Carthaginians. Inclining therefore\r\nfrom these considerations to the side of the former, he began sending\r\nmessages to the Consuls, proposing peace and friendship with them. The\r\nRomans accepted his offer, their chief motive being the consideration\r\nof provisions: for as the Carthaginians had command of the sea, they\r\nwere afraid of being cut off at every point from their supplies, warned\r\nby the fact that the legions which had previously crossed had run very\r\nshort in that respect. They therefore gladly accepted Hiero’s offers\r\nof friendship, supposing that he would be of signal service to them\r\nin this particular. The king engaged to restore his prisoners without\r\nransom, and to pay besides an indemnity of a hundred talents of silver.\r\nThe treaty being arranged on these terms, the Romans thenceforth\r\nregarded the Syracusans as friends and allies: while King Hiero, having\r\nthus placed himself under the protection of the Romans, never failed\r\nto supply their needs in times of difficulty; and for the rest of his\r\nlife reigned securely in Syracuse, devoting his energies to gaining\r\nthe gratitude and good opinion of the Greeks. And in point of fact no\r\nmonarch ever acquired a greater reputation, or enjoyed for a longer\r\nperiod the fruits of his prudent policy in private as well as in public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Carthaginians alarmed at Hiero’s defection make great\r\nefforts to increase their army in Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They select Agrigentum as their headquarters.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ When the text of this treaty reached Rome, and the people had\r\napproved and confirmed the terms made with Hiero, the Roman government\r\nthereupon decided not to send all their forces, as they had intended\r\ndoing, but only two legions. For they thought that the gravity of the\r\nwar was lessened by the adhesion of the king, and at the same time\r\nthat the army would thus be better off for provisions. But when the\r\nCarthaginian government saw that Hiero had become their enemy, and that\r\nthe Romans were taking a more decided part in Sicilian politics, they\r\nconceived that they must have a more formidable force to enable them\r\nto confront their enemy and maintain their own interests in Sicily.\r\nAccordingly, they enlisted mercenaries from over sea—a large number\r\nof Ligurians and Celts, and a still larger number of Iberians—and\r\ndespatched them to Sicily. And perceiving that Agrigentum possessed\r\nthe greatest natural advantages as a place of arms, and was the most\r\npowerful city in their province, they collected their supplies and\r\ntheir forces into it, deciding to use this city as their headquarters\r\nfor the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 262.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Consuls, Lucius Postumius Megellus and Quintus\r\nMamilius Vitulus, determined to lay siege to Agrigentum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Carthaginians make an unsuccessful sally.]\r\n\r\nOn the Roman side a change of commanders had now taken place. The\r\nConsuls who made the treaty with Hiero had gone home, and their\r\nsuccessors, Lucius Postumius and Quintus Mamilius, were come to Sicily\r\nwith their legions. Observing the measure which the Carthaginians were\r\ntaking, and the forces they were concentrating at Agrigentum, they made\r\nup their minds to take that matter in hand and strike a bold blow.\r\nAccordingly they suspended every other department of the war, and\r\nbearing down upon Agrigentum itself with their whole army, attacked it\r\nin force; pitched their camp within a distance of eight stades from\r\nthe city; and confined the Carthaginians within the walls. Now it was\r\njust harvest-time, and the siege was evidently destined to be a long\r\none: the soldiers, therefore, went out to collect the corn with greater\r\nhardihood than they ought to have done. Accordingly the Carthaginians,\r\nseeing the enemy scattered about the fields, sallied out and attacked\r\nthe harvesting-parties. They easily routed these; and then one portion\r\nof them made a rush to destroy the Roman entrenchment, the other to\r\nattack the pickets. But the peculiarity of their institutions saved the\r\nRoman fortunes, as it had often done before. Among them it is death for\r\na man to desert his post, or to fly from his station on any pretext\r\nwhatever. Accordingly on this, as on other occasions, they gallantly\r\nheld their ground against opponents many times their own number; and\r\nthough they lost many of their own men, they killed still more of the\r\nenemy, and at last outflanked the foes just as they were on the point\r\nof demolishing the palisade of the camp. Some they put to the sword,\r\nand the rest they pursued with slaughter into the city.\r\n\r\n+18.+ The result was that thenceforth the Carthaginians were somewhat\r\nless forward in making such attacks, and the Romans more cautious in\r\nforaging.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans form two strongly-entrenched camps.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A relief comes from Carthage to Agrigentum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanno seizes Herbesus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans faithfully supported by Hiero.]\r\n\r\nFinding that the Carthaginians would not come out to meet them at close\r\nquarters any more, the Roman generals divided their forces: with one\r\ndivision they occupied the ground round the temple of Asclepius outside\r\nthe town; with the other they encamped in the outskirts of the city on\r\nthe side which looks towards Heracleia. The space between the camps on\r\neither side of the city they secured by two trenches,—the inner one\r\nto protect themselves against sallies from the city, the outer as a\r\nprecaution against attacks from without, and to intercept those persons\r\nor supplies which always make their way surreptitiously into cities\r\nthat are sustaining a siege. The spaces between the trenches uniting\r\nthe camps they secured by pickets, taking care in their disposition\r\nto strengthen the several accessible points. As for food and other\r\nwar material, the other allied cities all joined in collecting and\r\nbringing these to Herbesus for them: and thus they supplied themselves\r\nin abundance with necessaries, by continually getting provisions living\r\nand dead from this town, which was conveniently near. For about five\r\nmonths then they remained in the same position, without being able to\r\nobtain any decided advantage over each other beyond the casualties\r\nwhich occurred in the skirmishes. But the Carthaginians were beginning\r\nto be hard pressed by hunger, owing to the number of men shut up in the\r\ncity, who amounted to no less than fifty thousand: and Hannibal, who\r\nhad been appointed commander of the besieged forces, beginning by this\r\ntime to be seriously alarmed at the state of things, kept perpetually\r\nsending messages to Carthage explaining their critical state, and\r\nbegging for assistance. Thereupon the Carthaginian government put on\r\nboard ship the fresh troops and elephants which they had collected,\r\nand despatched them to Sicily, with orders to join the other commander\r\nHanno. This officer collected all his war material and forces into\r\nHeracleia, and as a first step possessed himself by a stratagem of\r\nHerbesus, thus depriving the enemy of their provisions and supply of\r\nnecessaries. The result of this was that the Romans found themselves in\r\nthe position of besieged as much as in that of besiegers; for they were\r\nreduced by short supplies of food and scarcity of necessaries to such a\r\ncondition that they more than once contemplated raising the siege. And\r\nthey would have done so at last had not Hiero, by using every effort\r\nand contrivance imaginable, succeeded in keeping them supplied with\r\nwhat satisfied, to a tolerable extent, their most pressing wants. This\r\nwas Hanno’s first step. His next was as follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanno tempts the Roman cavalry out and defeats them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After two months, Hanno is forced to try to relieve\r\nAgrigentum,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: but is defeated in a pitched battle, and his army cut to\r\npieces.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal escapes by night; and the Romans enter and plunder\r\nAgrigentum.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ He saw that the Romans were reduced by disease and want, owing\r\nto an epidemic that had broken out among them, and he believed that\r\nhis own forces were strong enough to give them battle: he accordingly\r\ncollected his elephants, of which he had about fifty, and the whole\r\nof the rest of his army, and advanced at a rapid pace from Heracleia;\r\nhaving previously issued orders to the Numidian cavalry to precede\r\nhim, and to endeavour, when they came near the enemies’ stockade,\r\nto provoke them and draw their cavalry out; and, having done so,\r\nto wheel round and retire until they met him. The Numidians did as\r\nthey were ordered, and advanced up to one of the camps. Immediately\r\nthe Roman cavalry poured out and boldly charged the Numidians: the\r\nLibyans retired, according to their orders, until they reached Hanno’s\r\ndivision: then they wheeled round; surrounded, and repeatedly charged\r\nthe enemy; killed a great number of them, and chased the rest up to\r\ntheir stockade. After this affair Hanno’s force encamped over against\r\nthe Romans, having seized the hill called Torus, at a distance of\r\nabout a mile and a quarter from their opponents. For two months they\r\nremained in position without any decisive action, though skirmishes\r\ntook place daily. But as Hannibal all this time kept signalling and\r\nsending messages from the town to Hanno,—telling him that his men were\r\nimpatient of the famine, and that many were even deserting to the enemy\r\nowing to the distress for food,—the Carthaginian general determined to\r\nrisk a battle, the Romans being equally ready, for the reasons I have\r\nmentioned. So both parties advanced into the space between the camps\r\nand engaged. The battle lasted a long time, but at last the Romans\r\nturned the advanced guard of Carthaginian mercenaries. The latter fell\r\nback upon the elephants and the other divisions posted in their rear;\r\nand thus the whole Punic army was thrown into confusion. The retreat\r\nbecame general: the larger number of the men were killed, while some\r\neffected their escape into Heracleia; and the Romans became masters\r\nof most of the elephants and all the baggage. Now night came on, and\r\nthe victors, partly from joy at their success, partly from fatigue,\r\nkept their watches somewhat more carelessly than usual; accordingly\r\nHannibal, having given up hope of holding out, made up his mind that\r\nthis state of things afforded him a good opportunity of escape. He\r\nstarted about midnight from the town with his mercenary troops, and\r\nhaving choked up the trenches with baskets stuffed full of chaff, led\r\noff his force in safety, without being detected by the enemy. When\r\nday dawned the Romans discovered what had happened, and indeed for a\r\nshort time were engaged with Hannibal’s rear; but eventually they all\r\nmade for the town gates. There they found no one to oppose them: they\r\ntherefore threw themselves into the town, plundered it, and secured\r\na large number of captives, besides a great booty of every sort and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This success inspires the Senate with the idea of expelling\r\nthe Carthaginians from Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 261.]\r\n\r\n+20.+ Great was the joy of the Roman Senate when the news of what had\r\ntaken place at Agrigentum arrived. Their ideas too were so raised that\r\nthey no longer confined themselves to their original designs. They were\r\nnot content with having saved the Mamertines, nor with the advantages\r\ngained in the course of the war; but conceived the idea that it was\r\npossible to expel the Carthaginians entirely from the island, and that\r\nif that were done their own power would receive a great increase: they\r\naccordingly engaged in this policy and directed their whole thoughts to\r\nthis subject. As to their land forces they saw that things were going\r\non as well as they could wish. For the Consuls elected in succession to\r\nthose who had besieged Agrigentum, Lucius Valerius Flaccus and Titus\r\nOtacilius Crassus, appeared to be managing the Sicilian business as\r\nwell as circumstances admitted. Yet so long as the Carthaginians were\r\nin undisturbed command of the sea, the balance of success could not\r\nincline decisively in their favour. For instance, in the period which\r\nfollowed, though they were now in possession of Agrigentum, and though\r\nconsequently many of the inland towns joined the Romans from dread of\r\ntheir land forces, yet a still larger number of seaboard towns held\r\naloof from them in terror of the Carthaginian fleet. Seeing therefore\r\nthat it was ever more and more the case that the balance of success\r\noscillated from one side to the other from these causes; and, moreover,\r\nthat while Italy was repeatedly ravaged by the naval force, Libya\r\nremained permanently uninjured; they became eager to get upon the sea\r\nand meet the Carthaginians there.\r\n\r\nIt was this branch of the subject that more than anything else induced\r\nme to give an account of this war at somewhat greater length than I\r\notherwise should have done. I was unwilling that a first step of this\r\nkind should be unknown,—namely how, and when, and why the Romans first\r\nstarted a navy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans boldly determine to build ships and meet the\r\nCarthaginians at sea.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Carthaginian ship used as a model.]\r\n\r\nIt was, then, because they saw that the war they had undertaken\r\nlingered to a weary length, that they first thought of getting a fleet\r\nbuilt, consisting of a hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes. But\r\none part of their undertaking caused them much difficulty. Their\r\nshipbuilders were entirely unacquainted with the construction of\r\nquinqueremes, because no one in Italy had at that time employed vessels\r\nof that description. There could be no more signal proof of the\r\ncourage, or rather the extraordinary audacity of the Roman enterprise.\r\nNot only had they no resources for it of reasonable sufficiency;\r\nbut without any resources for it at all, and without having ever\r\nentertained an idea of naval war,—for it was the first time they had\r\nthought of it,—they nevertheless handled the enterprise with such\r\nextraordinary audacity, that, without so much as a preliminary trial,\r\nthey took upon themselves there and then to meet the Carthaginians\r\nat sea, on which they had for generations held undisputed supremacy.\r\nProof of what I say, and of their surprising audacity, may be found in\r\nthis. When they first took in hand to send troops across to Messene\r\nthey not only had no decked vessels but no war-ships at all, not so\r\nmuch as a single galley: but they borrowed quinqueremes and triremes\r\nfrom Tarentum and Locri, and even from Elea and Neapolis; and having\r\nthus collected a fleet, boldly sent their men across upon it. It was on\r\nthis occasion that, the Carthaginians having put to sea in the Strait\r\nto attack them, a decked vessel of theirs charged so furiously that it\r\nran aground, and falling into the hands of the Romans served them as a\r\nmodel on which they constructed their whole fleet. And if this had not\r\nhappened it is clear that they would have been completely hindered from\r\ncarrying out their design by want of constructive knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 260. Cn. Cornelius Scipio Asina, C. Duilius, Coss.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cornelius captured with the loss of his ships.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rest of the Roman fleet arrive and nearly capture\r\nHannibal.]\r\n\r\n+21.+ Meanwhile, however, those who were charged with the shipbuilding\r\nwere busied with the construction of the vessels; while others\r\ncollected crews and were engaged in teaching them to row on dry land:\r\nwhich they contrived to do in the following manner. They made the men\r\nsit on rower’s benches on dry land, in the same order as they would sit\r\non the benches in actual vessels: in the midst of them they stationed\r\nthe Celeustes, and trained them to get back and draw in their hands all\r\ntogether in time, and then to swing forward and throw them out again,\r\nand to begin and cease these movements at the word of the Celeustes.\r\nBy the time these preparations were completed the ships were built.\r\nThey therefore launched them, and, after a brief preliminary practice\r\nof real sea-rowing, started on their coasting voyage along the shore\r\nof Italy, in accordance with the Consul’s order. For Gnaeus Cornelius\r\nScipio, who had been appointed by the Roman people a few days before\r\nto command the fleet, after giving the ship captains orders that as\r\nsoon as they had fitted out the fleet they should sail to the Straits,\r\nhad put to sea himself with seventeen ships and sailed in advance to\r\nMessene; for he was very eager to secure all pressing necessaries for\r\nthe naval force. While there some negotiation was suggested to him for\r\nthe surrender of the town of Lipara. Snatching at the prospect somewhat\r\ntoo eagerly, he sailed with the above-mentioned ships and anchored\r\noff the town. But having been informed in Panormus of what had taken\r\nplace, the Carthaginian general Hannibal despatched Boōdes, a member\r\nof the Senate, with a squadron of twenty ships. He accomplished the\r\nvoyage at night and shut up Gnaeus and his men within the harbour.\r\nWhen day dawned the crews made for the shore and ran away, while\r\nGnaeus, in utter dismay, and not knowing in the least what to do,\r\neventually surrendered to the enemy. The Carthaginians having thus\r\npossessed themselves of the ships as well as the commander of their\r\nenemies, started to rejoin Hannibal. Yet a few days afterwards, though\r\nthe disaster of Gnaeus was so signal and recent, Hannibal himself was\r\nwithin an ace of falling into the same glaring mistake. For having\r\nbeen informed that the Roman fleet in its voyage along the coast of\r\nItaly was close at hand, he conceived a wish to get a clear view of\r\nthe enemy’s number and disposition. He accordingly set sail with fifty\r\nships, and just as he was rounding the “Italian Headland” he fell in\r\nwith the enemy, who were sailing in good order and disposition. He\r\nlost most of his ships, and with the rest effected his own escape in a\r\nmanner beyond hope or expectation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The “corvi” or “crows” for boarding.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ When the Romans had neared the coasts of Sicily and learnt the\r\ndisaster which had befallen Gnaeus, their first step was to send for\r\nGaius Duilius, who was in command of the land forces. Until he should\r\ncome they stayed where they were; but at the same time, hearing that\r\nthe enemy’s fleet was no great way off, they busied themselves with\r\npreparations for a sea-fight. Now their ships were badly fitted out\r\nand not easy to manage, and so some one suggested to them as likely to\r\nserve their turn in a fight the construction of what were afterwards\r\ncalled “crows.” Their mechanism was this. A round pole was placed in\r\nthe prow, about twenty-four feet high, and with a diameter of four\r\npalms. The pole itself had a pulley on the top, and a gangway made\r\nwith cross planks nailed together, four feet wide and thirty-six feet\r\nlong, was made to swing round it. Now the hole in the gangway was\r\noval shaped, and went round the pole twelve feet from one end of the\r\ngangway, which had also a wooden railing running down each side of it\r\nto the height of a man’s knee. At the extremity of this gangway was\r\nfastened an iron spike like a miller’s pestle, sharpened at its lower\r\nend and fitted with a ring at its upper end. The whole thing looked\r\nlike the machines for braising corn. To this ring the rope was fastened\r\nwith which, when the ships collided, they hauled up the “crows,” by\r\nmeans of the pulley at the top of the pole, and dropped them down\r\nupon the deck of the enemy’s ship, sometimes over the prow, sometimes\r\nswinging them round when the ships collided broadsides. And as soon\r\nas the “crows” were fixed in the planks of the decks and grappled the\r\nships together, if the ships were alongside of each other, the men\r\nleaped on board anywhere along the side, but if they were prow to prow,\r\nthey used the “crow” itself for boarding, and advanced over it two\r\nabreast. The first two protected their front by holding up before them\r\ntheir shields, while those who came after them secured their sides by\r\nplacing the rims of their shields upon the top of the railing. Such\r\nwere the preparations which they made; and having completed them they\r\nwatched an opportunity of engaging at sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victory of Duilius at Mylae, B.C. 260.]\r\n\r\n+23.+ As for Gaius Duilius, he no sooner heard of the disaster which\r\nhad befallen the commander of the navy than handing over his legions\r\nto the military Tribunes he transferred himself to the fleet. There\r\nhe learnt that the enemy was plundering the territory of Mylae, and\r\nat once sailed to attack him with the whole fleet. No sooner did the\r\nCarthaginians sight him than with joy and alacrity they put to sea\r\nwith a hundred and thirty sail, feeling supreme contempt for the Roman\r\nignorance of seamanship. Accordingly they all sailed with their prows\r\ndirected straight at their enemy: they did not think the engagement\r\nworth even the trouble of ranging their ships in any order, but\r\nadvanced as though to seize a booty exposed for their acceptance. Their\r\ncommander was that same Hannibal who had withdrawn his forces from\r\nAgrigentum by a secret night movement, and he was on board a galley\r\nwith seven banks of oars which had once belonged to King Pyrrhus. When\r\nthey neared the enemy, and saw the “crows” raised aloft on the prows\r\nof the several ships, the Carthaginians were for a time in a state of\r\nperplexity; for they were quite strangers to such contrivances as these\r\nengines. Feeling, however, a complete contempt for their opponents,\r\nthose on board the ships that were in the van of the squadron charged\r\nwithout flinching. But as soon as they came to close quarters their\r\nships were invariably tightly grappled by these machines; the enemy\r\nboarded by means of the “crows,” and engaged them on their decks;\r\nand in the end some of the Carthaginians were cut down, while others\r\nsurrendered in bewildered terror at the battle in which they found\r\nthemselves engaged, which eventually became exactly like a land fight.\r\nThe result was that they lost the first thirty ships engaged, crews and\r\nall. Among them was captured the commander’s ship also, though Hannibal\r\nhimself by an unexpected piece of luck and an act of great daring\r\neffected his escape in the ship’s boat. The rest of the Carthaginian\r\nsquadron were sailing up with the view of charging; but as they were\r\ncoming near they saw what had happened to the ships which were sailing\r\nin the front, and accordingly sheered off and avoided the blows of the\r\nengines. Yet trusting to their speed, they managed by a manœuvre to\r\nsail round and charge the enemy, some on their broadside and others on\r\ntheir stern, expecting by that method to avoid danger. But the engines\r\nswung round to meet them in every direction, and dropped down upon them\r\nso infallibly, that no ships could come to close quarters without being\r\ngrappled. Eventually the Carthaginians turned and fled, bewildered at\r\nthe novelty of the occurrence, and with a loss of fifty ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further operations in Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamilcar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Segesta and Macella.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal in Sardinia.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ Having in this unlooked-for manner made good their maritime hopes\r\nthe Romans were doubly encouraged in their enthusiasm for the war. For\r\nthe present they put in upon the coast of Sicily, raised the siege of\r\nSegesta when it was reduced to the last extremity, and on their way\r\nback from Segesta carried the town Macella by assault. But Hamilcar,\r\nthe commander of the Carthaginian land forces happened, after the\r\nnaval battle, to be informed as he lay encamped near Panormus that the\r\nallies were engaged in a dispute with the Romans about the post of\r\nhonour in the battles: and ascertaining that the allies were encamped\r\nby themselves between Paropus and Himeraean Thermae, he made a sudden\r\nattack in force as they were in the act of moving camp and killed\r\nalmost four thousand of them. After this action Hannibal sailed across\r\nto Carthage with such ships as he had left; and thence before very long\r\ncrossed to Sardinia, with a reinforcement of ships, and accompanied\r\nby some of those whose reputation as naval commanders stood high. But\r\nbefore very long he was blockaded in a certain harbour by the Romans,\r\nand lost a large number of ships; and was thereupon summarily arrested\r\nby the surviving Carthaginians and crucified. This came about because\r\nthe first thing the Romans did upon getting a navy was to try to become\r\nmasters of Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 258. Coss. A. Atilius Calatinus, C. Sulpicius,\r\nPaterculus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hippana and Myttistratum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Camarina.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next year the Roman legions in Sicily did nothing worthy\r\nof mention. In the next, after the arrival of the new Consuls, Aulus\r\nAtilius and Gaius Sulpicius, they started to attack Panormus because\r\nthe Carthaginian forces were wintering there. The Consuls advanced\r\nclose up to the city with their whole force, and drew up in order of\r\nbattle. But the enemy refusing to come out to meet them, they marched\r\naway and attacked the town of Hippana. This they carried by assault:\r\nbut though they also took Myttistratum it was only after it had stood a\r\nlengthened siege owing to the strength of its situation. It was at this\r\ntime, too, that they recovered Camarina, which had revolted a short\r\ntime previously. They threw up works against it, and captured it after\r\nmaking a breach in its walls. They treated Henna, and sundry other\r\nstrong places which had been in the hands of the Carthaginians, in the\r\nsame way; and when they had finished these operations they undertook to\r\nlay siege to Lipara.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fighting off Tyndaris.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coss. C. Atilius Regulus, Cn. Cornelius, Blasio II. B.C.\r\n257.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ Next year Gaius Atilius, the Consul, happened to be at anchor\r\noff Tyndaris, when he observed the Carthaginian fleet sailing by\r\nin a straggling manner. He passed the word to the crews of his own\r\nships to follow the advanced squadron, and started himself before the\r\nrest with ten ships of equal sailing powers. When the Carthaginians\r\nbecame aware that while some of the enemy were still embarking, others\r\nwere already putting out to sea, and that the advanced squadron were\r\nconsiderably ahead of the rest, they stood round and went to meet them.\r\nThey succeeded in surrounding and destroying all of them except the\r\nConsul’s ship, and that they all but captured with its crew. This last,\r\nhowever, by the perfection of its rowers and its consequent speed,\r\neffected a desperate escape. Meanwhile the remaining ships of the\r\nRomans were sailing up and gradually drawing close together. Having got\r\ninto line, they charged the enemy, took ten ships with their crews, and\r\nsunk eight. The rest of the Carthaginian ships retired to the Liparean\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter of B.C. 257-256.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 256. Coss. L. Manlius, Vulso Longus, M. Atilius Regulus\r\nII. (Suff.).]\r\n\r\nThe result of this battle was that both sides concluded that they were\r\nnow fairly matched, and accordingly made more systematic efforts to\r\nsecure a naval force, and to dispute the supremacy at sea. While these\r\nthings were going on, the land forces effected nothing worth recording;\r\nbut wasted all their time in such petty operations as chance threw in\r\ntheir way. Therefore, after making the preparations I have mentioned\r\nfor the approaching summer, the Romans, with three hundred and thirty\r\ndecked ships of war, touched at Messene; thence put to sea, keeping\r\nSicily on their right; and after doubling the headland Pachynus passed\r\non to Ecnomus, because the land force was also in that district. The\r\nCarthaginians on their part put to sea again with three hundred and\r\nfifty decked ships, touched at Lilybaeum, and thence dropped anchor at\r\nHeracleia Minoa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparations for the Battle of Ecnomus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman forces. 330 ships, with average of 420 men (300 rowers\r\n+ 120 marines) = 138,600 men.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carthaginian numbers, 150,000 men.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ Now it was the purpose of the Romans to sail across to Libya and\r\ntransfer the war there, in order that the Carthaginians might find the\r\ndanger affecting themselves and their own country rather than Sicily.\r\nBut the Carthaginians were determined to prevent this. They knew that\r\nLibya was easily invaded, and that the invaders if they once effected\r\na landing would meet with little resistance from the inhabitants; and\r\nthey therefore made up their minds not to allow it, and were eager\r\nrather to bring the matter to a decisive issue by a battle at sea. The\r\none side was determined to cross, the other to prevent their crossing;\r\nand their enthusiastic rivalry gave promise of a desperate struggle.\r\nThe preparations of the Romans were made to suit either contingency, an\r\nengagement at sea or a disembarkation on the enemy’s soil. Accordingly\r\nthey picked out the best hands from the land army and divided the\r\nwhole force which they meant to take on board into four divisions.\r\nEach division had alternative titles; the first was called the “First\r\nLegion” or the “First Squadron,”—and so on with the others. The fourth\r\nhad a third title besides. They were called “Triarii,” on the analogy\r\nof land armies. The total number of men thus making up the naval force\r\namounted to nearly one hundred and forty thousand, reckoning each ship\r\nas carrying three hundred rowers and one hundred and twenty soldiers.\r\nThe Carthaginians, on the other hand, made their preparations almost\r\nexclusively with a view to a naval engagement. Their numbers, if we\r\nreckon by the number of their ships, were over one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand men. The mere recital of these figures must, I should imagine,\r\nstrike any one with astonishment at the magnitude of the struggle, and\r\nthe vast resources of the contending states. An actual view of them\r\nitself could hardly be more impressive than the bare statement of the\r\nnumber of men and ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman order at Ecnomus.]\r\n\r\nNow the Romans had two facts to consider: First, that circumstances\r\ncompelled them to face the open sea; and, secondly, that their enemies\r\nhad the advantage of fast sailing vessels. They therefore took every\r\nprecaution for keeping their line unbroken and difficult to attack.\r\nThey had only two ships with six banks of oars, those, namely, on\r\nwhich the Consuls Marcus Atilius and Lucius Manlius respectively were\r\nsailing. These they stationed side by side in front and in a line with\r\neach other. Behind each of these they stationed ships one behind the\r\nother in single file—the first squadron behind the one, and the second\r\nsquadron behind the other. These were so arranged that, as each ship\r\ncame to its place, the two files diverged farther and farther from\r\neach other; the vessels being also stationed one behind the other with\r\ntheir prows inclining outwards. Having thus arranged the first and\r\nsecond squadrons in single file so as to form a wedge, they stationed\r\nthe third division in a single line at its base; so that the whole\r\nfinally presented the appearance of a triangle. Behind this base they\r\nstationed the horse-transports, attaching them by towing-ropes to the\r\nships of the third squadron. And to the rear of them they placed the\r\nfourth squadron, called the Triarii, in a single line, so extended as\r\nto overlap the line in front of them at both extremities. When these\r\ndispositions were complete the general appearance was that of a beak\r\nor wedge, the apex of which was open, the base compact and strong;\r\nwhile the whole was easy to work and serviceable, and at the same time\r\ndifficult to break up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The disposition of the Carthaginian fleet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ch. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ch. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ Meanwhile the Carthaginian commanders had briefly addressed their\r\nmen. They pointed out to them that victory in this battle would ensure\r\nthe war in the future being confined to the question of the possession\r\nof Sicily; while if they were beaten they would have hereafter to fight\r\nfor their native land and for all that they held dear. With these words\r\nthey passed the word to embark. The order was obeyed with universal\r\nenthusiasm, for what had been said brought home to them the issues at\r\nstake; and they put to sea in the full fervour of excited gallantry,\r\nwhich might well have struck terror into all who saw it. When their\r\ncommanders saw the arrangement of the enemies’ ships they adapted their\r\nown to match it. Three-fourths of their force they posted in a single\r\nline, extending their right wing towards the open sea with a view of\r\noutflanking their opponents, and placing their ships with prows facing\r\nthe enemy; while the other fourth part was posted to form a left wing\r\nof the whole, the vessels being at right angles to the others and\r\nclose to the shore. The two Carthaginian commanders were Hanno and\r\nHamilcar. The former was the general who had been defeated in the\r\nengagement at Agrigentum. He now commanded the right wing, supported\r\nby beaked vessels for charging, and the fastest sailing quinqueremes\r\nfor outflanking, the enemy. The latter, who had been in the engagement\r\noff Tyndaris, had charge of the left wing. This officer, occupying\r\nthe central position of the entire line, on this occasion employed a\r\nstratagem which I will now describe. The battle began by the Romans\r\ncharging the centre of the Carthaginians, because they observed that it\r\nwas weakened by their great extension. The ships in the Carthaginian\r\ncentre, in accordance with their orders, at once turned and fled with\r\na view of breaking up the Roman close order. They began to retire\r\nwith all speed, and the Romans pursued them with exultation. The\r\nconsequence was that, while the first and second Roman squadrons were\r\npressing the flying enemy, the third and fourth “legions” had become\r\ndetached and were left behind,—the former because they had to tow the\r\nhorse-transports, and the “Triarii” because they kept their station\r\nwith them and helped them to form a reserve. But when the Carthaginians\r\nthought that they had drawn the first and second squadron a sufficient\r\ndistance from the main body a signal was hoisted on board Hamilcar’s\r\nship, and they all simultaneously swung their ships round and engaged\r\ntheir pursuers. The contest was a severe one. The Carthaginians had\r\na great superiority in the rapidity with which they manœuvred their\r\nships. They darted out from their line and rowed round the enemy: they\r\napproached them with ease, and retired with despatch. But the Romans,\r\nno less than the Carthaginians, had their reasons for entertaining\r\nhopes of victory: for when the vessels got locked together the contest\r\nbecame one of sheer strength: their engines, the “crows,” grappled all\r\nthat once came to close quarters: and, finally, both the Consuls were\r\npresent in person and were witnesses of their behaviour in battle.\r\n\r\n+28.+ This was the state of affairs on the centre. But meanwhile Hanno\r\nwith the right wing, which had held aloof when the first encounter\r\ntook place, crossing the open sea, charged the ships of the Triarii\r\nand caused them great difficulty and embarrassment: while those of the\r\nCarthaginians who had been posted near the land manœuvred into line,\r\nand getting their ships straight, charged the men who were towing the\r\nhorse-transports. These latter let go the towing-ropes, grappled with\r\nthe enemy, and kept up a desperate struggle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three separate battles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First with Hamilcar’s squadron.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second squadron under Regulus.]\r\n\r\nSo that the engagement was in three separate divisions, or rather there\r\nwere three sea-fights going on at wide intervals from each other. Now\r\nin these three engagements the opposing parties were in each case\r\nfairly matched, thanks to the original disposition of the ships, and\r\ntherefore the victory was in each case closely contested. However the\r\nresult in the several cases was very much what was to be expected where\r\nforces were so equal. The first to engage were the first to separate:\r\nfor Hamilcar’s division at last were overpowered and fled. But while\r\nLucius was engaged in securing his prizes, Marcus observing the\r\nstruggle in which the Triarii and horse-transports were involved, went\r\nwith all speed to their assistance, taking with him all the ships of\r\nthe second squadron which were undamaged. As soon as he had reached and\r\nengaged Hanno’s division, the Triarii quickly picked up courage, though\r\nthey were then getting much the worst of it, and returned with renewed\r\nspirits to the fight. It was now the turn for the Carthaginians to be\r\nin difficulties. They were charged in front and on the rear, and found\r\nto their surprise that they were being surrounded by the relieving\r\nsquadron. They at once gave way and retreated in the direction of the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third squadron relieved by Regulus and Manlius.]\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, Lucius, who was sailing back to rejoin his\r\ncolleague, observed that the third squadron had got wedged in by the\r\nCarthaginians close in shore. Accordingly he and Marcus, who had by\r\nthis time secured the safety of the transports and Triarii, started\r\ntogether to relieve their imperilled comrades, who were now sustaining\r\nsomething very like a blockade. And the fact is that they would long\r\nbefore this have been utterly destroyed had not the Carthaginians been\r\nafraid of the “crows,” and confined themselves to surrounding and\r\npenning them in close to land, without attempting to charge for fear\r\nof being caught by the grappling-irons. The Consuls came up rapidly,\r\nand surrounding the Carthaginians captured fifty of their ships with\r\ntheir crews, while some few of them managed to slip away and escape by\r\nkeeping close to the shore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General result.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the separate engagements. But the general upshot\r\nof the whole battle was in favour of the Romans. Twenty-four of their\r\nvessels were destroyed; over thirty of the Carthaginians. Not a single\r\nRoman ship was captured with its crew; sixty-four of the Carthaginians\r\nwere so taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Aspis. (Clupea.)]\r\n\r\n+29.+ After the battle the Romans took in a fresh supply of victual,\r\nrepaired and refitted the ships they had captured, bestowed upon the\r\ncrews the attention which they had deserved by their victory, and\r\nthen put to sea with a view of continuing their voyage to Libya.\r\nTheir leading ships made the shore just under the headland called\r\nthe Hermaeum, which is the extreme point on the east of the Gulf of\r\nCarthage, and runs out into the open sea in the direction of Sicily.\r\nThere they waited for the rest of the ships to come up, and having\r\ngot the entire fleet together coasted along until they came to the\r\ncity called Aspis. Here they disembarked, beached their ships, dug a\r\ntrench, and constructed a stockade round them; and on the inhabitants\r\nof the city refusing to submit without compulsion, they set to work to\r\nbesiege the town. Presently those of the Carthaginians who had survived\r\nthe sea-fight came to land also; and feeling sure that the enemy, in\r\nthe flush of their victory, intended to sail straight against Carthage\r\nitself, they began by keeping a chain of advanced guards at outlying\r\npoints to protect the capital with their military and naval forces.\r\nBut when they ascertained that the Romans had disembarked without\r\nresistance and were engaged in besieging Aspis, they gave up the idea\r\nof watching for the descent of the fleet; but concentrated their\r\nforces, and devoted themselves to the protection of the capital and its\r\nenvirons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aspis taken.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M. Atilius Regulus remains in Africa, winter of B.C.\r\n256-255.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Romans had taken Aspis, had placed in it a garrison\r\nto hold it and its territory, and had besides sent home to Rome to\r\nannounce the events which had taken place and to ask for instructions\r\nas to the future,—what they were to do, and what arrangements they\r\nwere to make. Having done this they made active preparations for a\r\ngeneral advance and set about plundering the country. They met with\r\nno opposition in this: they destroyed numerous dwelling houses of\r\nremarkably fine construction, possessed themselves of a great number\r\nof cattle; and captured more than twenty thousand slaves whom they\r\ntook to their ships. In the midst of these proceedings the messengers\r\narrived from Rome with orders that one Consul was to remain with an\r\nadequate force, the other was to bring the fleet to Rome. Accordingly\r\nMarcus was left behind with forty ships, fifteen thousand infantry, and\r\nfive hundred cavalry; while Lucius put the crowd of captives on board,\r\nand having embarked his men, sailed along the coast of Sicily without\r\nencountering any danger, and reached Rome.\r\n\r\n+30.+ The Carthaginians now saw that their enemies contemplated a\r\nlengthened occupation of the country. They therefore proceeded first\r\nof all to elect two of their own citizens, Hasdrubal son of Hanno,\r\nand Bostarus, to the office of general; and next sent to Heracleia a\r\npressing summons to Hamilcar. He obeyed immediately, and arrived at\r\nCarthage with five hundred cavalry and five thousand infantry. He was\r\nforthwith appointed general in conjunction with the other two, and\r\nentered into consultation with Hasdrubal and his colleague as to the\r\nmeasures necessary to be taken in the present crisis. They decided\r\nto defend the country and not to allow it to be devastated without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 256-255. The operations of Regulus in Libya.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of the Carthaginians near Adys.]\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards Marcus sallied forth on one of his marauding\r\nexpeditions. Such towns as were unwalled he carried by assault and\r\nplundered, and such as were walled he besieged. Among others he came to\r\nthe considerable town of Adys, and having placed his troops round it\r\nwas beginning with all speed to raise siege works. The Carthaginians\r\nwere both eager to relieve the town and determined to dispute the\r\npossession of the open country. They therefore led out their army;\r\nbut their operations were not skilfully conducted. They indeed seized\r\nand encamped upon a piece of rising ground which commanded the enemy;\r\nbut it was unsuitable to themselves. Their best hopes rested on their\r\ncavalry and their elephants, and yet they abandoned the level plain\r\nand cooped themselves up in a position at once steep and difficult of\r\naccess. The enemy, as might have been expected, were not slow to take\r\nadvantage of this mistake. The Roman commanders were skilful enough to\r\nunderstand that the best and most formidable part of the forces opposed\r\nto them was rendered useless by the nature of the ground. They did not\r\ntherefore wait for them to come down to the plain and offer battle, but\r\nchoosing the time which suited themselves, began at daybreak a forward\r\nmovement on both sides of the hill. In the battle which followed the\r\nCarthaginians could not use their cavalry or elephants at all; but\r\ntheir mercenary troops made a really gallant and spirited sally. They\r\neven forced the first division of the Romans to give way and fly: but\r\nthey advanced too far, and were surrounded and routed by the division\r\nwhich was advancing from the other direction. This was immediately\r\nfollowed by the whole force being dislodged from their encampment.\r\nThe elephants and cavalry as soon as they gained level ground made\r\ngood their retreat without loss; but the infantry were pursued by\r\nthe Romans. The latter however soon desisted from the pursuit. They\r\npresently returned, dismantled the enemy’s entrenchment, and destroyed\r\nthe stockade; and from thenceforth overran the whole country-side and\r\nsacked the towns without opposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tunes.]\r\n\r\nAmong others they seized the town called Tunes. This place had many\r\nnatural advantages for expeditions such as those in which they were\r\nengaged, and was so situated as to form a convenient base of operations\r\nagainst the capital and its immediate neighbourhood. They accordingly\r\nfixed their headquarters in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distress at Carthage, which is heightened by an inroad of\r\nNumidians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spring of B.C. 255. Regulus proposes harsh terms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The terms rejected.]\r\n\r\n+31.+ The Carthaginians were now indeed in evil case. It was not long\r\nsince they had sustained a disaster at sea: and now they had met with\r\none on land, not from any failure of courage on the part of their\r\nsoldiers, but from the incompetency of their commanders. Simultaneously\r\nwith these misfortunes, they were suffering from an inroad of the\r\nNumidians, who were doing even more damage to the country than the\r\nRomans. The terror which they inspired drove the country folk to flock\r\nfor safety into the city; and the city itself had to face a serious\r\nfamine as well as a panic, the former from the numbers that crowded\r\ninto it, the latter from the hourly expectation of a siege. But Regulus\r\nhad different views. The double defeat sustained by the Carthaginians,\r\nby land as well as by sea, convinced him that the capture of Carthage\r\nwas a question of a very short time; and he was in a state of great\r\nanxiety lest his successor in the Consulship should arrive from Rome\r\nin time to rob him of the glory of the achievement. He therefore\r\ninvited the Carthaginians to make terms. They were only too glad of\r\nthe proposal, and sent their leading citizens to meet him. The meeting\r\ntook place: but the commissioners could not bring their minds to\r\nentertain his proposals; they were so severe that it was almost more\r\nthan they could bear to listen to them at all. Regulus regarded himself\r\nas practically master of the city, and considered that they ought to\r\nregard any concession on his part as a matter of favour and pure grace.\r\nThe Carthaginians on the other hand concluded that nothing worse could\r\nbe imposed on them if they suffered capture than was now enjoined.\r\nThey therefore returned home without accepting the offers of Regulus,\r\nand extremely exasperated by his unreasonable harshness. When the\r\nCarthaginian Senate heard the conditions offered by the Roman general,\r\nthough they had almost relinquished every hope of safety, they came to\r\nthe gallant and noble resolution that they would brave anything, that\r\nthey would try every possible means and endure every extremity, rather\r\nthan submit to terms so dishonourable and so unworthy of their past\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of the Spartan Xanthippus in Carthage.]\r\n\r\n+32.+ Now it happened that just about this time one of their recruiting\r\nagents, who had some time before been despatched to Greece, arrived\r\nhome. He brought a large number of men with him, and among them a\r\ncertain Lacedaemonian named Xanthippus, a man trained in the Spartan\r\ndiscipline, and of large experience in war. When this man was informed\r\nof their defeat, and of how it had taken place, and when he had\r\nreviewed the military resources still left to the Carthaginians, and\r\nthe number of their cavalry and elephants, he did not take long to\r\ncome to a decided conclusion. He expressed his opinion to his friends\r\nthat the Carthaginians had owed their defeat, not to the superiority\r\nof the Romans, but to the unskilfulness of their own commanders. The\r\ndangerous state of their affairs caused the words of Xanthippus to get\r\nabroad quickly among the people and to reach the ears of the generals;\r\nand the men in authority determined to summon and question him. He\r\nappeared, and laid his views before the magistrates; in which he showed\r\nto what they owed their present disasters, and that if they would\r\ntake his advice and keep to the flat parts of the country alike in\r\nmarching, encamping, and giving battle, they would be able with perfect\r\nease to secure safety for themselves and to defeat their opponents in\r\nthe field. The generals accepted the suggestion, resolved to follow\r\nhis advice, and there and then put their forces at his command. Among\r\nthe multitude the observation of Xanthippus was passed from mouth to\r\nmouth, and gave rise, as was to be expected, to a good deal of popular\r\nrumour and sanguine talk. This was confirmed when he had once handled\r\nthe troops. The way in which he got them into order when he had led\r\nthem outside the town; the skill with which he manœuvred the separate\r\ndetachments, and passed the word of command down the ranks in due\r\nconformity to the rules of tactics, at once impressed every one with\r\nthe contrast to the blundering of their former generals. The multitude\r\nexpressed their approbation by loud cheers, and were for engaging\r\nthe enemy without delay, convinced that no harm could happen to them\r\nas long as Xanthippus was their leader. The generals took advantage\r\nof this circumstance, and of the extraordinary recovery which they\r\nsaw had taken place in the spirits of the people. They addressed\r\nthem some exhortations befitting the occasion, and after a few days’\r\ndelay got their forces on foot and started. Their army consisted of\r\ntwelve thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry, and nearly a hundred\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new strategy of the Carthaginians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dispositions for the battle.]\r\n\r\n+33.+ The Romans at once noticed a change. They saw that the\r\nCarthaginians chose level country for their line of march, and flat\r\nplaces for their encampments. This novelty puzzled and rather alarmed\r\nthem, yet their prevailing feeling was an eager desire to come to\r\nclose quarters with the enemy. They therefore advanced to a position\r\nabout ten stades from them and employed the first day in pitching a\r\ncamp there. Next day, while the chief officers of the Carthaginians\r\nwere discussing in a council of war what dispositions were called for,\r\nand what line of strategy they were to adopt, the common soldiers, in\r\ntheir eagerness for the engagement, collected in groups, shouted out\r\nthe name of Xanthippus, and showed that their opinion was in favour of\r\nan immediate forward movement. Influenced by the evident enthusiasm\r\nand eagerness of the army, and by the appeals of Xanthippus that they\r\nshould not let the opportunity slip, the generals gave orders to the\r\nmen to get ready, and resigned to Xanthippus the entire direction of\r\naffairs, with full authority to act as he thought most advantageous.\r\nHe at once acted upon this authority. He ordered out the elephants,\r\nand placed them in a single line in front of the whole army. The heavy\r\nphalanx of the Carthaginians he stationed at a moderate interval in\r\nthe rear of these. He divided the mercenaries into three corps. One\r\nhe stationed on the right wing; while the other two, which consisted\r\nof the most active, he placed with the cavalry on both wings. When\r\nthe Romans saw that the enemy were drawn up to offer them battle\r\nthey readily advanced to accept it. They were however alarmed at\r\nthe elephants, and made special arrangements with a view to resist\r\ntheir charge. They stationed the velites in the van, and behind them\r\nthe legionaries, many maniples deep, while they divided the cavalry\r\nbetween the two wings. Their line of battle was thus less extended\r\nthan usual, but deeper. And though they had thereby made a sufficient\r\nprovision against the elephants, yet being far out-numbered in cavalry,\r\ntheir provision in that part of the field was altogether inadequate.\r\nAt length both sides had made their dispositions according to their\r\nrespective plans of operation, and had placed their several men in the\r\nposts assigned to them: and now they were standing drawn up in order,\r\nand were each of them watching for the right moment for beginning the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans are beaten and annihilated.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regulus made prisoner.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ No sooner had Xanthippus given the order to the men on the\r\nelephants to advance and disperse the lines in front of them, and to\r\nhis cavalry to outflank both wings and charge the enemy, than the Roman\r\narmy—clashing their shields and spears together after their usual\r\ncustom, and simultaneously raising their battle-cry—charged the enemy.\r\nThe Roman cavalry being far out-numbered by the Carthaginians were soon\r\nin full retreat on both wings. But the fortune of the several divisions\r\nof the infantry was various. Those stationed on the left wing—partly\r\nbecause they could avoid the elephants and partly because they thought\r\ncontemptuously of the mercenaries—charged the right wing of the\r\nCarthaginians, succeeded in driving them from their ground, and pursued\r\nthem as far as their entrenchment. Those stationed in front of the\r\nelephants were less fortunate. The maniples in front were thrown into\r\nutter confusion by the crushing weight of the animals: knocked down and\r\ntrampled upon by them they perished in heaps upon the field; yet owing\r\nto its great depth the main body remained for a time unbroken. But it\r\nwas not for long. The maniples on the rear found themselves outflanked\r\nby the cavalry, and were forced to face round and resist them: those on\r\nthe other hand who forced their way to the front through the elephants,\r\nand had now those beasts on their rear, found themselves confronted\r\nby the phalanx of Carthaginians, which had not yet been in action and\r\nwas still in close unbroken order, and so were cut to pieces. This was\r\nfollowed by a general rout. Most of the Romans were trampled to death\r\nby the enormous weight of the elephants; the rest were shot down in\r\ntheir ranks by the numerous cavalry: and there were only a very few who\r\nattempted to save themselves by flight. But the flatness of the country\r\nwas unfavourable to escape in this manner. Some of the fugitives were\r\ndestroyed by the elephants and cavalry; while only those who fled with\r\nthe general Regulus, amounting perhaps to five hundred, were after a\r\nshort pursuit made prisoners with him to a man.\r\n\r\nOn the Carthaginian side there fell about eight hundred of the\r\nmercenaries, those namely who had been stationed opposite the left wing\r\nof the Romans. On the part of the Romans about two thousand survived.\r\nThese were those whom I have already described as having chased the\r\nCarthaginian right wing to their entrenchment, and who were thus not\r\ninvolved in the general engagement. The rest were entirely destroyed\r\nwith the exception of those who fled with Regulus. The surviving\r\nmaniples escaped with considerable difficulty to the town of Aspis. The\r\nCarthaginians stripped the dead, and taking with them the Roman general\r\nand the rest of their prisoners, returned to the capital in a high\r\nstate of exultation at the turn their affairs had now taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eurip. fr.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ This event conveys many useful lessons to a thoughtful observer.\r\nAbove all, the disaster of Regulus gives the clearest possible warning\r\nthat no one should feel too confident of the favours of Fortune,\r\nespecially in the hour of success. Here we see one, who a short time\r\nbefore refused all pity or consideration to the fallen, brought\r\nincontinently to beg them for his own life. Again, we are taught the\r\ntruth of that saying of Euripides—\r\n\r\n   One wise man’s skill is worth a world in arms.\r\n\r\nFor it was one man, one brain, that defeated the numbers which were\r\nbelieved to be invincible and able to accomplish anything; and restored\r\nto confidence a whole city that was unmistakably and utterly ruined,\r\nand the spirits of its army which had sunk to the lowest depths of\r\ndespair. I record these things in the hope of benefiting my readers.\r\nThere are two roads to reformation for mankind—one through misfortunes\r\nof their own, the other through those of others: the former is the most\r\nunmistakable, the latter the less painful. One should never therefore\r\nvoluntarily choose the former, for it makes reformation a matter of\r\ngreat difficulty and danger; but we should always look out for the\r\nlatter, for thereby we can without hurt to ourselves gain a clear view\r\nof the best course to pursue. It is this which forces us to consider\r\nthat the knowledge gained from the study of true history is the best\r\nof all educations for practical life. For it is history, and history\r\nalone, which, without involving us in actual danger, will mature our\r\njudgment and prepare us to take right views, whatever may be the crisis\r\nor the posture of affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Xanthippus quits Carthage.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ To return to our narrative. Having obtained this complete success\r\nthe Carthaginians indulged in every sign of exultation. Thanksgivings\r\nwere poured out to God, and joyful congratulations interchanged among\r\nthemselves. But Xanthippus, by whose means such a happy change had\r\nbeen brought about and such an impulse been given to the fortunes of\r\nCarthage, did not remain there long, but took ship for home again. In\r\nthis he showed his wisdom and discernment. For it is the nature of\r\nextraordinary and conspicuous achievements to exasperate jealousies\r\nand envenom slander; against which a native may perhaps stand with the\r\nsupport of kinsfolk and friends, but a foreigner when exposed to one\r\nor the other of them is inevitably overpowered before long and put\r\nin danger. There is however another account sometimes given of the\r\ndeparture of Xanthippus, which I will endeavour at a more suitable\r\nopportunity to set forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans prepare a fleet to relieve their beaten army.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 255. Coss. Ser. Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior, M. Aemilius\r\nPaullus.]\r\n\r\nUpon this unlooked-for catastrophe in the Libyan campaign, the Roman\r\ngovernment at once set to work to fit out a fleet to take off the men\r\nwho were still surviving there; while the Carthaginians followed up\r\ntheir success by sitting down before Aspis, and besieging it, being\r\nanxious to get the survivors of the battle into their hands. But\r\nfailing to capture the place, owing to the gallantry and determined\r\ncourage of these men, they eventually raised the siege. When they\r\nheard that the Romans were preparing their fleet, and were intending\r\nto sail once more against Libya, they set about shipbuilding also,\r\npartly repairing old vessels and partly constructing new. Before very\r\nlong they had manned and launched two hundred ships, and were on the\r\nwatch for the coming of their enemies. By the beginning of the summer\r\nthe Romans had launched three hundred and fifty vessels. They put them\r\nunder the command of the Consuls Marcus Aemilius and Servius Fulvius,\r\nand despatched them. This fleet coasted along Sicily; made for Libya;\r\nand having fallen in with the Carthaginian squadron off Hermaeum, at\r\nonce charged and easily turned them to flight; captured a hundred and\r\nfourteen with their crews, and having taken on board their men who had\r\nmaintained themselves in Libya, started from Aspis on their return\r\nvoyage to Sicily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fleet is lost in a storm.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Between June 28 and July 26.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ The passage was effected in safety, and the coast of Camarina\r\nwas reached: but there they experienced so terrible a storm, and\r\nsuffered so dreadfully, as almost to beggar description. The disaster\r\nwas indeed extreme: for out of their three hundred and sixty-four\r\nvessels eighty only remained. The rest were either swamped or driven\r\nby the surf upon the rocks and headlands, where they went to pieces\r\nand filled all the seaboard with corpses and wreckage. No greater\r\ncatastrophe is to be found in all history as befalling a fleet at one\r\ntime. And for this Fortune was not so much to blame as the commanders\r\nthemselves. They had been warned again and again by the pilots not to\r\nsteer along the southern coast of Sicily facing the Libyan sea, because\r\nit was exposed and yielded no safe anchorage; and because, of the two\r\ndangerous constellations, one had not yet set and the other was on the\r\npoint of rising (for their voyage fell between the rising of Orion and\r\nthat of the Dog Star). Yet they attended to none of these warnings;\r\nbut, intoxicated by their recent success, were anxious to capture\r\ncertain cities as they coasted along, and in pursuance of this idea\r\nthoughtlessly exposed themselves to the full fury of the open sea. As\r\nfar as these particular men were concerned, the disaster which they\r\nbrought upon themselves in the pursuit of trivial advantages convinced\r\nthem of the folly of their conduct. But it is a peculiarity of the\r\nRoman people as a whole to treat everything as a question of main\r\nstrength; to consider that they must of course accomplish whatever they\r\nhave proposed to themselves; and that nothing is impossible that they\r\nhave once determined upon. The result of such self-confidence is that\r\nin many things they do succeed, while in some few they conspicuously\r\nfail, and especially at sea. On land it is against men only and their\r\nworks that they have to direct their efforts: and as the forces against\r\nwhich they exert their strength do not differ intrinsically from\r\ntheir own, as a general rule they succeed; while their failures are\r\nexceptional and rare. But to contend with the sea and sky is to fight\r\nagainst a force immeasurably superior to their own: and when they trust\r\nto an exertion of sheer strength in such a contest the disasters which\r\nthey meet with are signal. This is what they experienced on the present\r\noccasion: they have often experienced it since; and will continue to do\r\nso, as long as they maintain their headstrong and foolhardy notion that\r\nany season of the year admits of sailing as well as marching.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Carthaginians renew operations in Sicily.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ When the Carthaginians heard of the destruction which had\r\nbefallen the Roman fleet, they made up their minds that as their late\r\nvictory had made them a match for their enemy on land, so now the\r\nRoman catastrophe had made them a match for him at sea. Accordingly\r\nthey devoted themselves with still greater eagerness than before to\r\ntheir naval and military preparations. And first, they lost no time in\r\ndespatching Hasdrubal to Sicily, and with him not only the soldiers\r\nthat they had already collected, but those also whom they had recalled\r\nfrom Heracleia; and along with them they sent also a hundred and forty\r\nelephants. And next, after despatching him, they began fitting out two\r\nhundred ships and making all other preparations necessary for a naval\r\nexpedition. Hasdrubal reached Lilybaeum safely, and immediately set to\r\nwork to train his elephants and drill his men, and showed his intention\r\nof striking a blow for the possession of the open country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 254. Coss. Gn. Cornelius Scipio Asina II., Aulus\r\nAtilius, Calatinus II.]\r\n\r\nThe Roman government, when they heard of this from the survivors of the\r\nwreck on their arrival home, felt it to be a grievous misfortune; but\r\nbeing absolutely resolved not to give in, they determined once more\r\nto put two hundred and twenty vessels on the stocks and build afresh.\r\nThese were finished in three months, an almost incredibly short time,\r\nand the new Consuls Aulus Atilius and Gnaeus Cornelius fitted out the\r\nfleet and put to sea. As they passed through the straits they took up\r\nfrom Messene those of the vessels which had been saved from the wreck;\r\nand having thus arrived with three hundred ships off Panormus, which\r\nis the strongest town of all the Carthaginian province in Sicily, they\r\nbegan to besiege it. They threw up works in two distinct places, and\r\nafter other necessary preparations brought up their battering rams. The\r\ntower next the sea was destroyed with ease, and the soldiers forced\r\ntheir way in through the breach: and so what is called the New Town was\r\ncarried by assault; while what is called the Old Town being placed by\r\nthis event in imminent danger, its inhabitants made haste to surrender\r\nit. Having thus made themselves masters of the place, the army sailed\r\nback to Rome, leaving a garrison in the town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 253. Coss. Gn. Servilius Caepio, G. Sempronius Blaesus.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ But next summer the new Consuls Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius\r\nSempronius put again to sea with their full strength, and after\r\ntouching at Sicily started thence for Libya. There, as they coasted\r\nalong the shore, they made a great number of descents upon the country\r\nwithout accomplishing anything of importance in any of them. At length\r\nthey came to the island of the Lotophagi called Mēnix, which is not\r\nfar from the Lesser Syrtis. There, from ignorance of the waters, they\r\nran upon some shallows; the tide receded, their ships went aground,\r\nand they were in extreme peril. However, after a while the tide\r\nunexpectedly flowed back again, and by dint of throwing overboard all\r\ntheir heavy goods they just managed to float the ships. After this\r\ntheir return voyage was more like a flight than anything else. When\r\nthey reached Sicily and had made the promontory of Lilybaeum they cast\r\nanchor at Panormus. Thence they weighed anchor for Rome, and rashly\r\nventured upon the open sea-line as the shortest; but while on their\r\nvoyage they once more encountered so terrible a storm that they lost\r\nmore than a hundred and fifty ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 252.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 251. Coss. Lucius Caecilius Metellus, G. Furius\r\nPacilus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 252-251.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 250.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans after this misfortune, though they are eminently persistent\r\nin carrying out their undertakings, yet owing to the severity and\r\nfrequency of their disasters, now yielded to the force of circumstances\r\nand refrained from constructing another fleet. All the hopes still left\r\nto them they rested upon their land forces: and, accordingly, they\r\ndespatched the Consuls Lucius Caecilius and Gaius Furius with their\r\nlegions to Sicily; but they only manned sixty ships to carry provisions\r\nfor the legions. The fortunes of the Carthaginians had in their turn\r\nconsiderably improved owing to the catastrophes I have described. They\r\nnow commanded the sea without let or hindrance, since the Romans had\r\nabandoned it; while in their land forces their hopes were high. Nor\r\nwas it unreasonable that it should be so. The account of the battle\r\nof Libya had reached the ears of the Romans: they had heard that the\r\nelephants had broken their ranks and had killed the large part of those\r\nthat fell: and they were in such terror of them, that though during\r\ntwo years running after that time they had on many occasions, in the\r\nterritory either of Lilybaeum or Selinus, found themselves in order of\r\nbattle within five or six stades of the enemy, they never plucked up\r\ncourage to begin an attack, or in fact to come down upon level ground\r\nat all, all because of their fear of an elephant charge. And in these\r\ntwo seasons all they did was to reduce Therma and Lipara by siege,\r\nkeeping close all the while to mountainous districts and such as were\r\ndifficult to cross. The timidity and want of confidence thus displayed\r\nby their land forces induced the Roman government to change their minds\r\nand once more to attempt success at sea. Accordingly, in the second\r\nconsulship of Caius Atilius and Lucius Manlius, we find them ordering\r\nfifty ships to be built, enrolling sailors and energetically collecting\r\na naval armament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 251.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skirmishing at Panormus.]\r\n\r\n+40.+ Meanwhile Hasdrubal noticed the terror displayed by the Romans\r\nwhenever they had lately found themselves in the presence of the\r\nenemy. He learnt also that one of the Consuls had departed and gone\r\nto Italy, and that Caecilius was lingering in Panormus with the other\r\nhalf of the army, with the view of protecting the corn-crops of the\r\nallies just then ripe for the harvest. He therefore got his troops in\r\nmotion, marched out, and encamped on the frontier of the territory\r\nof Panormus. Caecilius saw well enough that the enemy had become\r\nsupremely confident, and he was anxious to draw him on; he therefore\r\nkept his men within the walls. Hasdrubal imagined that Caecilius\r\ndared not come out to give him battle. Elated with this idea, he\r\npushed boldly forward with his whole army and marched over the pass\r\ninto the territory of Panormus. But though he was destroying all the\r\nstanding crops up to the very walls of the town, Caecilius was not\r\nshaken from his resolution, but kept persistently to it, until he had\r\ninduced him to cross the river which lay between him and the town. But\r\nno sooner had the Carthaginians got their elephants and men across,\r\nthan Caecilius commenced sending out his light-armed troops to harass\r\nthem, until he had forced them to get their whole army into fighting\r\norder. When he saw that everything was happening as he designed it,\r\nhe placed some of his light troops to line the wall and moat, with\r\ninstructions that if the elephants came within range they should pour\r\nvolleys of their missiles upon them; but that whenever they found\r\nthemselves being forced from their ground by them, they should retreat\r\ninto the moat, rush out of it again, and hurl darts at the elephants\r\nwhich happened to be nearest. At the same time he gave orders to the\r\narmourers in the market-place to carry the missiles and heap them up\r\noutside at the foot of the wall. Meanwhile he took up his own position\r\nwith his maniples at the gate which was opposite the enemy’s left\r\nwing, and kept despatching detachment after detachment to reinforce\r\nhis skirmishers. The engagement commenced by them becoming more and\r\nmore general, a feeling of emulation took possession of the officers\r\nin charge of the elephants. They wished to distinguish themselves in\r\nthe eyes of Hasdrubal, and they desired that the credit of the victory\r\nshould be theirs: they therefore, with one accord, charged the advanced\r\nskirmishing parties of the enemy, routed them with ease, and pursued\r\nthem up to the moat. But no sooner did the elephants thus come to\r\nclose quarters than they were wounded by the archers on the wall, and\r\noverwhelmed with volleys of pila and javelins which poured thick and\r\nfast upon them from the men stationed on the outer edge of the moat,\r\nand who had not yet been engaged,—and thus, studded all over with\r\ndarts, and wounded past all bearing, they soon got beyond control. They\r\nturned and bore down upon their own masters, trampling men to death,\r\nand throwing their own lines into utter disorder and confusion. When\r\nCaecilius saw this he led out his men with promptitude. His troops were\r\nfresh; the enemy were in disorder; and he charged them diagonally on\r\nthe flank: the result was that he inflicted a severe defeat upon them,\r\nkilled a large number, and forced the rest into precipitate flight. Of\r\nthe elephants he captured ten along with their Indian riders: the rest\r\nwhich had thrown their Indians he managed to drive into a herd after\r\nthe battle, and secured every one of them. This achievement gained him\r\nthe credit on all hands of having substantially benefited the Roman\r\ncause, by once more restoring confidence to the army, and giving them\r\nthe command of the open country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 250. C. Caecilius Regulus II., L. Manlius Vulso II.]\r\n\r\n+41.+ The announcement of this success at Rome was received with\r\nextreme delight; not so much at the blow inflicted on the enemy by\r\nthe loss of their elephants, as at the confidence inspired in their\r\nown troops by a victory over these animals. With their confidence\r\nthus restored, the Roman government recurred to their original plan\r\nof sending out the Consuls upon this service with a fleet and naval\r\nforces; for they were eager, by all means in their power, to put a\r\nperiod to the war. Accordingly, in the fourteenth year of the war,\r\nthe supplies necessary for the despatch of the expedition were got\r\nready, and the Consuls set sail for Sicily with two hundred ships.\r\nThey dropped anchor at Lilybaeum; and the army having met them there,\r\nthey began to besiege it by sea and land. Their view was that if they\r\ncould obtain possession of this town they would have no difficulty in\r\ntransferring the seat of war to Libya. The Carthaginian leaders were\r\nof the same opinion, and entirely agreed with the Roman view of the\r\nvalue of the place. They accordingly subordinated everything else to\r\nthis; devoted themselves to the relief of the place at all hazards; and\r\nresolved to retain this town at any sacrifice: for now that the Romans\r\nwere masters of all the rest of Sicily, except Drepana, it was the only\r\nfoothold they had left in the island.\r\n\r\nTo understand my story a knowledge of the topography of the district\r\nis necessary. I will therefore endeavour in a few words to convey\r\na comprehension to my readers of its geographical position and its\r\npeculiar advantages.\r\n\r\n+42.+ Sicily, then, lies towards Southern Italy very much in the same\r\nrelative position as the Peloponnese does to the rest of Greece. The\r\nonly difference is that the one is an island, the other a peninsula;\r\nand consequently in the former case there is no communication except\r\nby sea, in the latter there is a land communication also. The shape\r\nof Sicily is a triangle, of which the several angles are represented\r\nby promontories: that to the south jutting out into the Sicilian Sea\r\nis called Pachynus; that which looks to the north forms the western\r\nextremity of the Straits of Messene and is about twelve stades from\r\nItaly, its name is Pelorus; while the third projects in the direction\r\nof Libya itself, and is conveniently situated opposite the promontories\r\nwhich cover Carthage, at a distance of about a thousand stades:\r\nit looks somewhat south of due west, dividing the Libyan from the\r\nSardinian Sea, and is called Lilybaeum. On this last there is a city\r\nof the same name. It was this city that the Romans were now besieging.\r\nIt was exceedingly strongly fortified: for besides its walls there was\r\na deep ditch running all round it, and on the side of the sea it was\r\nprotected by lagoons, to steer through which into the harbour was a\r\ntask requiring much skill and practice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Lilybaeum, B.C. 250.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans made two camps, one on each side of the town, and connected\r\nthem with a ditch, stockade, and wall. Having done this, they began\r\nthe assault by advancing their siege-works in the direction of the\r\ntower nearest the sea, which commands a view of the Libyan main.\r\nThey did this gradually, always adding something to what they had\r\nalready constructed; and thus bit by bit pushed their works forward\r\nand extended them laterally, till at last they had brought down not\r\nonly this tower, but the six next to it also; and at the same time\r\nbegan battering all the others with battering-rams. The siege was\r\ncarried on with vigour and terrific energy: every day some of the\r\ntowers were shaken and others reduced to ruins; every day too the\r\nsiege-works advanced farther and farther, and more and more towards\r\nthe heart of the city. And though there were in the town, besides the\r\nordinary inhabitants, as many as ten thousand hired soldiers, the\r\nconsternation and despondency became overwhelming. Yet their commander\r\nHimilco omitted no measure within his power. As fast as the enemy\r\ndemolished a fortification he threw up a new one; he also countermined\r\nthem, and reduced the assailants to straits of no ordinary difficulty.\r\nMoreover, he made daily sallies, attempted to carry or throw fire\r\ninto the siege-works, and with this end in view fought many desperate\r\nengagements by night as well as by day: so determined was the fighting\r\nin these struggles, that sometimes the number of the dead was greater\r\nthan it ordinarily is in a pitched battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted treason in Lilybaeum.]\r\n\r\n+43.+ But about this time some of the officers of highest rank in the\r\nmercenary army discussed among themselves a project for surrendering\r\nthe town to the Romans, being fully persuaded that the men under their\r\ncommand would obey their orders. They got out of the city at night,\r\nwent to the enemy’s camp, and held a parley with the Roman commander on\r\nthe subject. But Alexon the Achaean, who on a former occasion had saved\r\nAgrigentum from destruction when the mercenary troops of Syracuse made\r\na plot to betray it, was on this occasion once more the first to detect\r\nthis treason, and to report it to the general of the Carthaginians.\r\nThe latter no sooner heard it than he at once summoned a meeting of\r\nthose officers who were still in their quarters; and exhorted them to\r\nloyalty with prayers and promises of liberal bounties and favours, if\r\nthey would only remain faithful to him, and not join in the treason\r\nof the officers who had left the town. They received his speech with\r\nenthusiasm, and were there and then commissioned by him, some to go\r\nto the Celts accompanied by Hannibal, who was the son of the Hannibal\r\nkilled in Sardinia, and who had a previous acquaintance with that\r\npeople gained in the expedition against them; others to fetch the rest\r\nof the mercenary troops, accompanied by Alexon, because he was liked\r\nand trusted by them. These officers then proceeded to summon a meeting\r\nof their men and address them. They pledged their own credit for the\r\nbounties promised them severally by the General, and without difficulty\r\npersuaded the men to remain staunch. The result was that when the\r\nofficers, who had joined in the secret mission, returned to the walls\r\nand tried to address their men, and communicate the terms offered by\r\nthe Romans, so far from finding any adherents, they could not even\r\nobtain a hearing, but were driven from the wall with volleys of stones\r\nand darts. But this treason among their mercenaries constituted a\r\nserious danger: the Carthaginians had a narrow escape from absolute\r\nruin, and they owed their preservation from it to that same Alexon\r\nwhose fidelity had on a former occasion preserved for Agrigentum her\r\nterritory, constitution, and freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal relieves Lilybaeum.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ Meanwhile the Carthaginians at home knew nothing of what was\r\ngoing on. But they could calculate the requirements of a besieged\r\ngarrison; and they accordingly filled fifty vessels with soldiers,\r\nfurnished their commander Hannibal, a son of Hamilcar, and an officer\r\nand prime favourite of Adherbal’s, with instructions suitable to the\r\nbusiness in hand, and despatched him with all speed: charging him to\r\nbe guilty of no delay, to omit no opportunity, and to shrink from no\r\nattempt however venturesome to relieve the besieged. He put to sea with\r\nhis ten thousand men, and dropped anchor at the islands called Aegusae,\r\nwhich lie in the course between Lilybaeum and Carthage, and there\r\nlooked out for an opportunity of making Lilybaeum. At last a strong\r\nbreeze sprang up in exactly the right quarter: he crowded all sail and\r\nbore down before the wind right upon the entrance of the harbour, with\r\nhis men upon the decks fully armed and ready for battle. Partly from\r\nastonishment at this sudden appearance, partly from dread of being\r\ncarried along with the enemy by the violence of the gale into the\r\nharbour of their opponents, the Romans did not venture to obstruct the\r\nentrance of the reinforcement; but stood out at sea overpowered with\r\namazement at the audacity of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe town population crowded to the walls, in an agony of anxiety as to\r\nwhat would happen, no less than in an excess of joy at the unlooked-for\r\nappearance of hope, and cheered on the crews as they sailed into the\r\nharbour, with clapping hands and cries of gladness. To sail into the\r\nharbour was an achievement of great danger; but Hannibal accomplished\r\nit gallantly, and, dropping anchor there, safely disembarked his\r\nsoldiers. The exultation of all who were in the city was not caused\r\nso much by the presence of the reinforcement, though they had thereby\r\ngained a strong revival of hope, and a large addition to their\r\nstrength, as by the fact that the Romans had not dared to intercept the\r\ncourse of the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sally from Lilybaeum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It fails.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ Himilco, the general in command at Lilybaeum, now saw that both\r\ndivisions of his troops were in high spirits and eager for service,—the\r\noriginal garrison owing to the presence of the reinforcement, the newly\r\narrived because they had as yet had no experience of the hardships of\r\nthe situation. He wished to take advantage of the excited feelings\r\nof both parties, before they cooled, in order to organise an attempt\r\nto set fire to the works of the besiegers. He therefore summoned\r\nthe whole army to a meeting, and dwelt upon the themes suitable to\r\nthe occasion at somewhat greater length than usual. He raised their\r\nzeal to an enthusiastic height by the magnitude of his promises for\r\nindividual acts of courage, and by declaring the favours and rewards\r\nwhich awaited them as an army at the hands of the Carthaginians. His\r\nspeech was received with lively marks of satisfaction; and the men\r\nwith loud shouts bade him delay no more, but lead them into the field.\r\nFor the present, however, he contented himself with thanking them and\r\nexpressing his delight at their excellent spirit, and bidding them go\r\nearly to rest and obey their officers, dismissed them. But shortly\r\nafterwards he summoned the officers; assigned to them severally the\r\nposts best calculated for the success of the undertaking; communicated\r\nto them the watchword and the exact moment the movement was to be made;\r\nand issued orders to the commanders to be at the posts assigned with\r\ntheir men at the morning watch. His orders were punctually obeyed:\r\nand at daybreak he led out his forces and made attempts upon the\r\nsiege-works at several points. But the Romans had not been blind to\r\nwhat was coming, and were neither idle nor unprepared. Wherever help\r\nwas required it was promptly rendered; and at every point they made a\r\nstout resistance to the enemy. Before long there was fighting all along\r\nthe line, and an obstinate struggle round the entire circuit of the\r\nwall; for the sallying party were not less than twenty thousand strong,\r\nand their opponents more numerous still. The contest was all the\r\nhotter from the fact that the men were not fighting in their regular\r\nranks, but indiscriminately, and as their own judgment directed; the\r\nresult of which was that a spirit of personal emulation arose among\r\nthe combatants, because, though the numbers engaged were so great,\r\nthere was a series of single combats between man and man, or company\r\nand company. However, it was at the siege-works themselves that the\r\nshouting was loudest and the throng of combatants the densest. At\r\nthese troops had been massed deliberately for attack and defence. The\r\nassailants strove their utmost to dislodge the defenders, the defenders\r\nexerted all their courage to hold their ground and not yield an inch\r\nto the assailants,—and with such emulation and fury on both sides,\r\nthat they ended by falling at their posts rather than yield. But\r\nthere were others mingled with these, carrying torchwood and tow and\r\nfire, who made a simultaneous attack upon the battering-rams at every\r\npoint: hurling these fiery missiles against them with such audacity,\r\nthat the Romans were reduced to the last extremity of danger, being\r\nquite unable to overpower the attack of the enemy. But the general\r\nof the Carthaginians, seeing that he was losing large numbers in the\r\nengagement, without being able to gain the object of the sortie,\r\nwhich was to take the siege-works, ordered his trumpeters to sound a\r\nrecall. So the Romans, after coming within an ace of losing all their\r\nsiege-gear, finally kept possession of the works, and were able to\r\nmaintain them all without dispute.\r\n\r\n+46.+ After this affair Hannibal eluded the enemy’s watch, and sailed\r\nout of the harbour by night with his ships to Drepana, to join the\r\nCarthaginian Commander-in-Chief, Adherbal. Drepana is about one hundred\r\nand twenty stades from Lilybaeum, and was always an object of special\r\ncare to the Carthaginians from the convenience of its position and the\r\nexcellence of its harbour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal the Rhodian offers to run the blockade.]\r\n\r\nNow the Carthaginian government were anxious to learn the state of\r\naffairs at Lilybaeum, but could not do so because the garrison was\r\nstrictly blockaded, and the Romans were exceedingly vigilant. In this\r\ndifficulty a nobleman, called Hannibal the Rhodian, came to them, and\r\noffered to run the blockade, to see what was going on in Lilybaeum with\r\nhis own eyes, and to report. The offer delighted them, but they did\r\nnot believe in the possibility of its fulfilment with the Roman fleet\r\nlying at the very entrance of the channel. However, the man fitted out\r\nhis own private vessel and put to sea. He first crossed to one of the\r\nislands lying off Lilybaeum. Next day he obtained a wind in the right\r\nquarter, and about ten o’clock in the morning actually sailed into the\r\nharbour in the full view of the enemy, who looked on with amazement\r\nat his audacity. Next day he lost no time in setting about a return\r\nvoyage. The Roman Consul had determined on taking extra precautions\r\nfor watching the sea near the channel: with this view he had during\r\nthe night got ready his ten fastest-sailing vessels, and taking up a\r\nposition on shore close to the harbour mouth, was watching with his own\r\neyes what would happen. The whole army was watching also; while the\r\nships on both sides of the mouth of the channel got as close to the\r\nshallows as it was possible to approach, and there rested with their\r\noars out, and ready to run down and capture the ship that was about to\r\nsail out. The Rhodian, on his side, attempted no concealment. He put\r\nboldly to sea, and so confounded the enemy by his audacity, and the\r\nspeed of his vessel, that he not only sailed out without receiving any\r\ndamage to ship or crew, scudding along the bows of the enemy as though\r\nthey were fixed in their places, but even brought his ship to, after\r\nrunning a short way ahead, and, with his oars out and ready, seemed\r\nto challenge the foe to a contest. When none of them ventured to put\r\nout to attack him, because of the speed of his rowing, he sailed away:\r\nhaving thus with his one ship successfully defied the entire fleet of\r\nthe enemy. From this time he frequently performed the same feat, and\r\nproved exceedingly serviceable both to the government at Carthage and\r\nthe besieged garrison. To the former by informing them from time to\r\ntime of what was pressingly necessary; and to the latter by inspiring\r\nthem with confidence, and dismaying the Romans by his audacity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His example is followed by others.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rhodian is at length captured.]\r\n\r\n+47.+ What contributed most to encourage him to a repetition of the\r\nfeat was the fact that by frequent experience he had marked out the\r\ncourse for himself by clear land marks. As soon as he had crossed\r\nthe open sea, and was coming into sight, he used to steer as though\r\nhe were coming from Italy, keeping the seaward tower exactly on his\r\nbows, in such a way as to be in a line with the city towers which\r\nfaced towards Libya; and this is the only possible course to hit the\r\nmouth of the channel with the wind astern. The successful boldness of\r\nthe Rhodian inspired several of those who were acquainted with these\r\nwaters to make similar attempts. The Romans felt themselves to be\r\nin a great difficulty; and what was taking place determined them to\r\nattempt blocking up the mouth of the harbour. The greater part of the\r\nattempted work was a failure: the sea was too deep, and none of the\r\nmaterial which they threw into it would hold, or in fact keep in the\r\nleast compact. The breakers and the force of the current dislodged and\r\nscattered everything that was thrown in, before it could even reach the\r\nbottom. But there was one point where the water was shallow, at which\r\na mole was with infinite labour made to hold together; and upon it a\r\nvessel with four banks of oars and of unusually fine build stuck fast\r\nas it was making the outward passage at night, and thus fell into the\r\nhands of the enemy. The Romans took possession of it, manned it with a\r\npicked crew, and used it for keeping a look out for all who should try\r\nto enter the harbour, and especially for the Rhodian. He had sailed in,\r\nas it happened, that very night, and was afterwards putting out to sea\r\nagain in his usual open manner. He was, however, startled to see the\r\nfour-banked vessel put out to sea again simultaneously with himself.\r\nHe recognised what ship it was, and his first impulse was to escape\r\nher by his superior speed. But finding himself getting overhauled by\r\nthe excellence of her rowers, he was finally compelled to bring to and\r\nengage at close quarters. But in a struggle of marines he was at a\r\ncomplete disadvantage: the enemy were superior in numbers, and their\r\nsoldiers were picked men; and he was made prisoner. The possession of\r\nthis ship of superior build enabled the Romans, by equipping her with\r\nwhatever was wanted for the service she had to perform, to intercept\r\nall who were adventurous enough to try running the blockade of\r\nLilybaeum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A storm having damaged the siege-works, the Lilybaeans\r\nsucceed in burning them.]\r\n\r\n+48.+ Meanwhile, the besieged were energetically carrying on\r\ncounterworks, having abandoned the hope of damaging or destroying the\r\nconstructions of the enemy. But in the midst of these proceedings a\r\nstorm of wind, of such tremendous violence and fury, blew upon the\r\nmachinery of the engines, that it wrecked the pent-houses, and carried\r\naway by its force the towers erected to cover them. Some of the Greek\r\nmercenaries perceived the advantage such a state of things offered\r\nfor the destruction of the siege-works, and communicated their idea\r\nto the commander. He caught at the suggestion, and lost no time in\r\nmaking every preparation suitable to the undertaking. Then the young\r\nmen mustered at three several points, and threw lighted brands into the\r\nenemy’s works. The length of time during which these works had been\r\nstanding made them exactly in the proper state to catch fire easily;\r\nand when to this was added a violent wind, blowing right upon the\r\nengines and towers, the natural result was that the spreading of the\r\nfire became rapid and destructive; while all attempts on the Roman side\r\nto master it, and rescue their works, had to be abandoned as difficult\r\nor wholly impracticable. Those who tried to come to the rescue were\r\nso appalled at the scene, that they could neither fully grasp nor\r\nclearly see what was going on. Flames, sparks, and volumes of smoke\r\nblew right in their faces and blinded them; and not a few dropped down\r\nand perished without ever getting near enough to attempt to combat\r\nthe fire. The same circumstances, which caused these overwhelming\r\ndifficulties to the besiegers, favoured those who were throwing the\r\nfire-brands in exactly the same proportion. Everything that could\r\nobscure their vision or hurt them was blown clean away and carried into\r\nthe faces of the enemy; while their being able to see the intervening\r\nspace enabled the shooters to take a good aim at those of the enemy who\r\ncame to the rescue, and the throwers of the fire-brands to lodge them\r\nat the proper places for the destruction of the works. The violence\r\nof the wind, too, contributed to the deadly effect of the missiles by\r\nincreasing the force of their blows. Eventually the destruction was\r\nso complete, that the foundations of the siege-towers and the blocks\r\nof the battering-rams were rendered unusable by the fire. In spite of\r\nthis disaster, though they gave up the idea of assaulting the place\r\nany longer by means of their works, the Romans still persisted. They\r\nsurrounded the town with a ditch and stockade, threw up an additional\r\nwall to secure their own encampment, and left the completion of their\r\npurpose to time. Nor were the besieged less determined. They repaired\r\nthe part of their walls which had been thrown down, and prepared to\r\nendure the siege with good courage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman army is reinforced.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 249. Coss. P. Claudius Pulcher, L. Junius Pullus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claudius sails to attack Drepana.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ When the announcement of these events at Rome was followed by\r\nreiterated tidings that the larger part of the crews of the fleet had\r\nbeen destroyed, either at the works, or in the general conduct of the\r\nsiege, the Roman government set zealously to work to enlist sailors;\r\nand, having collected as many as ten thousand, sent them to Sicily.\r\nThey crossed the straits, and reached the camp on foot; and when they\r\nhad joined, Publius Claudius, the Consul, assembled his tribunes,\r\nand said that it was just the time to sail to the attack of Drepana\r\nwith the whole squadron: for that Adherbal,[139] who was in command\r\nthere, was quite unprepared for such an event, because he as yet knew\r\nnothing of the new crews having arrived; and was fully persuaded\r\nthat their fleet could not sail, owing to their loss of men in the\r\nsiege. His proposition met with a ready assent from the council of\r\nofficers, and he immediately set about getting his men on board, the\r\nold crews as well as those who had recently joined. As for marines, he\r\nselected the best men from the whole army, who were ready enough to\r\njoin an expedition which involved so short a voyage and so immediate\r\nand certain an advantage. Having completed these preparations, he set\r\nsail about midnight, without being detected by the enemy; and for the\r\nfirst part of the day he sailed in close order, keeping the land on\r\nhis right. By daybreak the leading ships could be seen coming towards\r\nDrepana; and at the first sight of them Adherbal was overwhelmed with\r\nsurprise. He quickly recovered his self-possession however: and, fully\r\nappreciating the significance of the enemy’s attack, he determined to\r\ntry every manœuvre, and hazard every danger, rather than allow himself\r\nand his men to be shut up in the blockade which threatened them.\r\nHe lost no time in collecting his rowing-crews upon the beach, and\r\nsummoning the mercenary soldiers who were in the town by proclamation.\r\nWhen the muster had taken place, he endeavoured to impress upon them\r\nin a few words what good hopes of victory they had, if they were bold\r\nenough to fight at sea; and what hardships they would have to endure\r\nin a blockade, if they hesitated from any fear of danger and played\r\nthe coward. The men showed a ready enthusiasm for the sea-fight, and\r\ndemanded with shouts that he would lead them to it without delay. He\r\nthanked them, praised their zeal, and gave the order to embark with all\r\nspeed, to keep their eyes upon his ship, and follow in its wake. Having\r\nmade these instructions clear as quickly as he could, he got under\r\nweigh himself first, and guided his fleet close under the rocks, on the\r\nopposite side of the harbour to that by which the enemy were entering.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unexpected resistance of Adherbal. The Roman fleet checked.]\r\n\r\n+50.+ When the Consul Publius saw, to his surprise, that the enemy, so\r\nfar from giving in or being dismayed at his approach, were determined\r\nupon fighting him at sea: while of his own ships some were already\r\nwithin the harbour, others just in the very entrance channel, and\r\nothers still on their way towards it; he at once issued orders to all\r\nthe ships to turn round and make the best of their way out again. The\r\nresult of this was that, as some of the ships were in the harbour,\r\nand others at the entrance, they fouled each other when they began\r\nreversing their course; and not only did a great confusion arise among\r\nthe men, but the ships got their oars broken also in the collisions\r\nwhich occurred. However, the captains exerted themselves to get the\r\nships into line close under the shore, as they successively cleared\r\nthe harbour, and with their prows directed towards the enemy. Publius\r\nhimself was originally bringing up the rear of the entire squadron; but\r\nhe now, while the movement was actually in execution, turned towards\r\nthe open sea and transferred himself to a position on the left wing of\r\nthe fleet. At the same moment Adherbal succeeded in outflanking the\r\nleft of his opponents with five vessels furnished with charging beaks.\r\nHe turned his own ship with its prow towards the enemy, and brought to.\r\nAs each of the others came up, and fell into line with him, he sent\r\norders to them by his staff officers to do the same as he had done.\r\nThus they all fell in and formed a complete line. The signal which had\r\nbeen agreed upon before was given, and an advance was begun, which was\r\nmade at first without disarranging the line. The Romans were still\r\nclose in-shore, waiting for the coming out of their ships from the\r\nharbour; and this proximity to the land proved of infinite disadvantage\r\nto them in the engagement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans beaten.]\r\n\r\n+51.+ And now the fleets were within a short distance of each other:\r\nthe signals were raised from the ships of the respective commanders;\r\nthe charge was made; and ship grappled with ship. At first the\r\nengagement was evenly balanced, because each fleet had the pick of\r\ntheir land forces serving as marines on board. But as it went on\r\nthe many advantages which, taking it as a whole, the Carthaginians\r\npossessed, gave them a continually increasing superiority. Owing to the\r\nbetter construction of their ships they had much the advantage in point\r\nof speed, while their position with the open sea behind them materially\r\ncontributed to their success, by giving them freer space for their\r\nmanœuvres. Were any of them hard pressed by the enemy? Their speed\r\nsecured them a sure escape, and a wide expanse of water was open to\r\ntheir flight. There they would swing round and attack the leading ships\r\nwhich were pursuing them: sometimes rowing round them and charging\r\ntheir broadsides, at other times running alongside them as they lurched\r\nawkwardly round, from the weight of the vessels and the unskilfulness\r\nof the crews. In this way they were charging perpetually, and managed\r\nto sink a large number of the ships. Or was one of their number in\r\ndanger? They were ready to come to the rescue, being out of danger\r\nthemselves, and being able to effect a movement to right or left, by\r\nsteering along the sterns of their own ships and through the open sea\r\nunmolested. The case of the Romans was exactly the reverse. If any of\r\nthem were hard pressed, there was nowhere for them to retreat, for they\r\nwere fighting close to the shore; and any ship of theirs that was hard\r\ndriven by the enemy either backed into shallow water and stuck fast,\r\nor ran ashore and was stranded. Moreover, that most effective of all\r\nmanœuvres in sea fights,—sailing through the enemy’s line and appearing\r\non their stern while they are engaged with others,—was rendered\r\nimpossible for them, owing to the bulk of their vessels; and still more\r\nso by the unskilfulness of their crews. Nor, again, were they able\r\nto bring help from behind to those who wanted it, because they were\r\nhemmed in so close to the shore that there was not the smallest space\r\nleft in which those who wished to render such help might move. When\r\nthe Consul saw how ill things were going for him all along the line;\r\nwhen he saw some of his ships sticking fast in the shallows, and others\r\ncast ashore; he took to flight. Thirty other ships which happened to be\r\nnear him followed him as he sailed from the left, and coasted along the\r\nshore. But the remaining vessels, which amounted to ninety-three, the\r\nCarthaginians captured with their crews, except in the case of those\r\nwho ran their ships ashore and got away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans not discouraged send the Consul L. Junius with a\r\nlarge supply of provisions in 800 transports, convoyed by 60 ships of\r\nwar to Lilybaeum.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ The result of this sea fight gave Adherbal a high reputation at\r\nCarthage; for his success was looked upon as wholly due to himself,\r\nand his own foresight and courage: while at Rome Publius fell into\r\ngreat disrepute, and was loudly censured as having acted without due\r\ncaution or calculation, and as having during his administration, as\r\nfar as a single man could, involved Rome in serious disasters. He was\r\naccordingly some time afterwards brought to trial, was heavily fined,\r\nand exposed to considerable danger. Not that the Romans gave way in\r\nconsequence of these events. On the contrary, they omitted nothing\r\nthat was within their power to do, and continued resolute to prosecute\r\nthe campaign. It was now the time for the Consular elections: as soon\r\nas they were over and two Consuls appointed; one of them, Lucius\r\nJunius,[140] was immediately sent to convey corn to the besiegers of\r\nLilybaeum, and other provisions and supplies necessary for the army,\r\nsixty ships being also manned to convoy them. Upon his arrival at\r\nMessene, Junius took over such ships as he found there to meet him,\r\nwhether from the army or from the other parts of Sicily, and coasted\r\nalong with all speed to Syracuse, with a hundred and twenty ships, and\r\nhis supplies on board about eight hundred transports. Arrived there,\r\nhe handed over to the Quaestors half his transports and some of his\r\nwar-ships, and sent them off, being very anxious that what the army\r\nneeded should reach them promptly. He remained at Syracuse himself,\r\nwaiting for such of his ships as had not yet arrived from Messene, and\r\ncollecting additional supplies of corn from the allies in the central\r\ndistricts of the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carthalo tries to intercept the transports.]\r\n\r\n+53.+ Meanwhile Adherbal sent the prisoners he had taken in the sea\r\nfight, and the captured vessels, to Carthage; and giving Carthalo his\r\ncolleague thirty vessels, in addition to the seventy in command of\r\nwhich he had come, despatched him with instructions to make a sudden\r\nattack upon the enemy’s ships that were at anchor off Lilybaeum,\r\ncapture all he could, and set fire to the rest. In obedience to\r\nthese instructions Carthalo accomplished his passage just before\r\ndaybreak, fired some of the vessels, and towed off others. Great was\r\nthe commotion at the quarters of the Romans. For as they hurried to\r\nthe rescue of the ships, the attention of Himilco, the commander of\r\nthe garrison, was aroused by their shouts; and as the day was now\r\nbeginning to break, he could see what was happening, and despatched\r\nthe mercenary troops who were in the town. Thus the Romans found\r\nthemselves surrounded by danger on every side, and fell into a state of\r\nconsternation more than usually profound and serious. The Carthaginian\r\nadmiral contented himself with either towing off or breaking up some\r\nfew of their vessels, and shortly afterwards coasted along under the\r\npretence of making for Heracleia: though he was really lying in wait,\r\nwith the view of intercepting those who were coming by sea to the\r\nRoman army. When his look-out men brought him word that a considerable\r\nnumber of vessels of all sorts were bearing down upon him, and were\r\nnow getting close, he stood out to sea and started to meet them: for\r\nthe success just obtained over the Romans inspired him with such\r\ncontempt for them, that he was eager to come to an engagement. The\r\nvessels in question were those which had been despatched in advance\r\nunder the charge of the Quaestors from Syracuse. And they too had\r\nwarning of their danger. Light boats were accustomed to sail in advance\r\nof a squadron, and these announced the approach of the enemy to the\r\nQuaestors; who being convinced that they were not strong enough to\r\nstand a battle at sea, dropped anchor under a small fortified town\r\nwhich was subject to Rome, and which, though it had no regular harbour,\r\nyet possessed roadsteads, and headlands projecting from the mainland,\r\nand surrounding the roadsteads, so as to form a convenient refuge.\r\nThere they disembarked; and having set up some catapults and ballistae,\r\nwhich they got from the town, awaited the approach of the enemy. When\r\nthe Carthaginians arrived, their first idea was to blockade them:\r\nfor they supposed that the men would be terrified and retreat to the\r\nfortified town, leaving them to take possession of the vessels without\r\nresistance. Their expectations, however, were not fulfilled; and\r\nfinding that the men on the contrary resisted with spirit, and that the\r\nsituation of the spot presented many difficulties of every description,\r\nthey sailed away again after towing off some few of the transports\r\nladen with provisions, and retired to a certain river, in which they\r\nanchored and kept a look out for the enemy to renew their voyage.\r\n\r\n+54.+ In complete ignorance of what had happened to his advanced\r\nsquadron, the Consul, who had remained behind at Syracuse, after\r\ncompleting all he meant to do there, put to sea; and, after rounding\r\nPachynus, was proceeding on his voyage to Lilybaeum. The appearance of\r\nthe enemy was once more signalled to the Carthaginian admiral by his\r\nlook-out men, and he at once put out to sea, with the view of engaging\r\nthem as far as possible away from their comrades. Junius saw the\r\nCarthaginian fleet from a considerable distance, and observing their\r\ngreat numbers did not dare to engage them, and yet found it impossible\r\nto avoid them by flight because they were now too close. He therefore\r\nsteered towards land, and anchored under a rocky and altogether\r\ndangerous part of the shore; for he judged it better to run all risks\r\nrather than allow his squadron, with all its men, to fall into the\r\nhands of the enemy. The Carthaginian admiral saw what he had done;\r\nand determined that it was unadvisable for him to engage the enemy,\r\nor bring his ships near such a dangerous place. He therefore made for\r\na certain headland between the two squadrons of the enemy, and there\r\nkept a look out upon both with equal vigilance. Presently, however,\r\nthe weather became rough, and there was an appearance of an unusually\r\ndangerous disturbance setting in from the sea. The Carthaginian pilots,\r\nfrom their knowledge of the particular localities, and of seamanship\r\ngenerally, foresaw what was coming; and persuaded Carthalo to avoid\r\nthe storm and round the promontory of Pachynus.[141] He had the good\r\nsense to take their advice: [Sidenote: The Roman fleet is wrecked.] and\r\naccordingly these men, with great exertions and extreme difficulty,\r\ndid get round the promontory and anchored in safety; while the Romans,\r\nbeing exposed to the storm in places entirely destitute of harbours,\r\nsuffered such complete destruction, that not one of the wrecks even was\r\nleft in a state available for use. Both of their squadrons in fact were\r\ncompletely disabled to a degree past belief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans abandon the sea.]\r\n\r\n+55.+ This occurrence caused the Carthaginian interests to look up\r\nagain and their hopes to revive. But the Romans, though they had met\r\nwith partial misfortunes before, had never suffered a naval disaster\r\nso complete and final. They, in fact, abandoned the sea, and confined\r\nthemselves to holding the country; while the Carthaginians remained\r\nmasters of the sea, without wholly despairing of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lucius Junius perseveres in the siege. B.C. 248.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eryx.]\r\n\r\nGreat and general was the dismay both at Rome and in the camp at\r\nLilybaeum. Yet they did not abandon their determination of starving\r\nout that town. The Roman government did not allow their disasters\r\nto prevent their sending provisions into the camp overland; and the\r\nbesiegers kept up the investment as strictly as they possibly could.\r\nLucius Junius joined the camp after the shipwreck, and, being in a\r\nstate of great distress at what had happened, was all eagerness to\r\nstrike some new and effective blow, and thus repair the disaster which\r\nhad befallen him. Accordingly he took the first slight opening that\r\noffered to surprise and seize Eryx; and became master both of the\r\ntemple of Aphrodite and of the city. This is a mountain close to the\r\nsea-coast on that side of Sicily which looks towards Italy, between\r\nDrepana and Panormus, but nearer to Drepana of the two. It is by far\r\nthe greatest mountain in Sicily next to Aetna; and on its summit, which\r\nis flat, stands the temple of Erycinian Aphrodite, confessedly the\r\nmost splendid of all the temples in Sicily for its wealth and general\r\nmagnificence. The town stands immediately below the summit, and is\r\napproached by a very long and steep ascent. Lucius seized both town and\r\ntemple; and established a garrison both upon the summit and at the foot\r\nof the road to it from Drepana. He kept a strict guard at both points,\r\nbut more especially at the foot of the ascent, believing that by so\r\ndoing he should secure possession of the whole mountain as well as the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 247.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Occupation of Hercte by Hamilcar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 247-244.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ Next year, the eighteenth of the war, the Carthaginians\r\nappointed Hamilcar Barcas general, and put the management of the\r\nfleet in his hands. He took over the command, and started to ravage\r\nthe Italian coast. After devastating the districts of Locri, and the\r\nrest of Bruttium, he sailed away with his whole fleet to the coast of\r\nPanormus and seized on a place called Hercte, which lies between Eryx\r\nand Panormus on the coast, and is reputed the best situation in the\r\ndistrict for a safe and permanent camp. For it is a mountain rising\r\nsheer on every side, standing out above the surrounding country to a\r\nconsiderable height. The table-land on its summit has a circumference\r\nof not less than a hundred stades, within which the soil is rich\r\nin pasture and suitable for agriculture; the sea-breezes render it\r\nhealthy; and it is entirely free from all dangerous animals. On the\r\nside which looks towards the sea, as well as that which faces the\r\ncentral part of the island, it is enclosed by inaccessible precipices;\r\nwhile the spaces between them require only slight fortifications,\r\nand of no great extent, to make them secure. There is in it also an\r\neminence, which serves at once as an acropolis and as a convenient\r\ntower of observation, commanding the surrounding district. It also\r\ncommands a harbour conveniently situated for the passage from Drepana\r\nand Lilybaeum to Italy, in which there is always abundant depth of\r\nwater; finally, it can only be reached by three ways—two from the land\r\nside, one from the sea, all of them difficult. Here Hamilcar entrenched\r\nhimself. It was a bold measure: but he had no city which he could\r\ncount upon as friendly, and no other hope on which he could rely; and\r\nthough by so doing he placed himself in the very midst of the enemy,\r\nhe nevertheless managed to involve the Romans in many struggles and\r\ndangers. To begin with, he would start from this place and ravage the\r\nseaboard of Italy as far as Cumae; and again on shore, when the Romans\r\nhad pitched a camp to overawe him, in front of the city of Panormus,\r\nwithin about five stades of him, he harassed them in every sort of\r\nway, and forced them to engage in numerous skirmishes, for the space\r\nof nearly three years. Of these combats it is impossible to give a\r\ndetailed account in writing.\r\n\r\n+57.+ It is like the case of two boxers, eminent alike for their\r\ncourage and their physical condition, engaged in a formal contest\r\nfor the prize. As the match goes on, blow after blow is interchanged\r\nwithout intermission; but to anticipate, or keep account of every feint\r\nor every blow delivered is impossible for combatants and spectators\r\nalike. Still one may conceive a sufficiently distinct idea of the\r\naffair by taking into account the general activity of the men, the\r\nambition actuating each side, and the amount of their experience,\r\nstrength, and courage. The same may be said of these two generals. No\r\nwriter could set down, and no reader would endure the wearisome and\r\nprofitless task of reading, a detailed statement of the transactions\r\nof every day; why they were undertaken, and how they were carried out.\r\nFor every day had its ambuscade on one side or the other, its attack,\r\nor assault. A general assertion in regard to the men, combined with the\r\nactual result of their mutual determination to conquer, will give a far\r\nbetter idea of the facts. It may be said then, generally, that nothing\r\nwas left untried,—whether it be stratagems which could be learnt from\r\nhistory, or plans suggested by the necessities of the hour and the\r\nimmediate circumstances of the case, or undertakings depending upon\r\nan adventurous spirit and a reckless daring. The matter, however, for\r\nseveral reasons, could not be brought to a decisive issue. In the first\r\nplace, the forces on either side were evenly matched: and in the second\r\nplace, while the camps were in the case of both equally impregnable,\r\nthe space which separated the two was very small. The result of this\r\nwas that skirmishes between detached parties on both sides were always\r\ngoing on during the day, and yet nothing decisive occurred. For though\r\nthe men actually engaged in such skirmishes from time to time were cut\r\nto pieces, it did not affect the main body. They had only to wheel\r\nround to find themselves out of the reach of danger behind their own\r\ndefences. Once there, they could face about and again engage the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Eryx, B.C. 244.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 243-242.]\r\n\r\n+58.+ Presently however Fortune, acting like a good umpire in the\r\ngames, transferred them by a bold stroke from the locality just\r\ndescribed, and the contest in which they were engaged, to a struggle\r\nof greater danger and a locality of narrower dimensions. The Romans,\r\nas we have said, were in occupation of the summit of Eryx, and had a\r\nguard stationed at its foot. But Hamilcar managed to seize the town\r\nwhich lay between these two spots. There ensued a siege of the Romans\r\nwho were on the summit, supported by them with extraordinary hardihood\r\nand adventurous daring: while the Carthaginians, finding themselves\r\nbetween two hostile armies, and their supplies brought to them with\r\ndifficulty, because they were in communication with the sea at only one\r\npoint and by one road, yet held out with a determination that passes\r\nbelief. Every contrivance which skill or force could sustain did they\r\nput in use against each other, as before; every imaginable privation\r\nwas submitted to; surprises and pitched battles were alike tried: and\r\nfinally they left the combat a drawn one, not, as Fabius says, from\r\nutter weakness and misery, but like men still unbroken and unconquered.\r\nThe fact is that before either party had got completely the better of\r\nthe other, though they had maintained the conflict for another two\r\nyears, the war happened to be decided in quite a different manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The obstinate persistence of the Romans and Carthaginians.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs at Eryx and with the forces employed\r\nthere. The two nations engaged were like well-bred game-cocks that\r\nfight to their last gasp. You may see them often, when too weak to\r\nuse their wings, yet full of pluck to the end, and striking again\r\nand again. Finally, chance brings them the opportunity of once more\r\ngrappling, and they hold on until one or other of them drops down dead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans once more fit out a fleet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 242. Coss. C. Lutatius Catulus, A. Postumius Albinus.]\r\n\r\n+59.+ So it was with the Romans and Carthaginians. They were worn out\r\nby the labours of the war; the perpetual succession of hard fought\r\nstruggles was at last driving them to despair; their strength had\r\nbecome paralysed, and their resources reduced almost to extinction by\r\nwar-taxes and expenses extending over so many years. And yet the Romans\r\ndid not give in. For the last five years indeed they had entirely\r\nabandoned the sea, partly because of the disasters they had sustained\r\nthere, and partly because they felt confident of deciding the war by\r\nmeans of their land forces; but they now determined for the third time\r\nto make trial of their fortune in naval warfare. They saw that their\r\noperations were not succeeding according to their calculations, mainly\r\nowing to the obstinate gallantry of the Carthaginian general. They\r\ntherefore adopted this resolution from a conviction that by this means\r\nalone, if their design were but well directed, would they be able to\r\nbring the war to a successful conclusion. In their first attempt they\r\nhad been compelled to abandon the sea by disasters arising from sheer\r\nbad luck; in their second by the loss of the naval battle off Drepana.\r\nThis third attempt was successful: they shut off the Carthaginian\r\nforces at Eryx from getting their supplies by sea, and eventually put\r\na period to the whole war. Nevertheless it was essentially an effort\r\nof despair. The treasury was empty, and would not supply the funds\r\nnecessary for the undertaking, which were, however, obtained by the\r\npatriotism and generosity of the leading citizens. They undertook\r\nsingly, or by two or three combining, according to their means, to\r\nsupply a quinquereme fully fitted out, on the understanding that they\r\nwere to be repaid if the expedition was successful. By these means a\r\nfleet of two hundred quinqueremes were quickly prepared, built on the\r\nmodel of the ship of the Rhodian. Gaius Lutatius was then appointed\r\nto the command, and despatched at the beginning of the summer. His\r\nappearance on the coasts of Sicily was a surprise: the whole of the\r\nCarthaginian fleet had gone home; and he took possession both of the\r\nharbour near Drepana, and the roadsteads near Lilybaeum. He then\r\nthrew up works round the city on Drepana, and made other preparations\r\nfor besieging it. And while he pushed on these operations with all\r\nhis might, he did not at the same time lose sight of the approach of\r\nthe Carthaginian fleet. He kept in mind the original idea of this\r\nexpedition, that it was by a victory at sea alone that the result of\r\nthe whole war could be decided. He did not, therefore, allow the time\r\nto be wasted or unemployed. He practised and drilled his crews every\r\nday in the manœuvres which they would be called upon to perform; and\r\nby his attention to discipline generally brought his sailors in a very\r\nshort time to the condition of trained athletes for the contest before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Carthaginians send Hanno with a fleet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 10th March B.C. 241. A strong breeze is blowing.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lutatius however decides to fight.]\r\n\r\n+60.+ That the Romans should have a fleet afloat once more, and\r\nbe again bidding for the mastery at sea, was a contingency wholly\r\nunexpected by the Carthaginians. They at once set about fitting out\r\ntheir ships, loaded them with corn and other provisions, and despatched\r\ntheir fleet: determined that their troops round Eryx should not run\r\nshort of necessary provisions. Hanno, who was appointed to command the\r\nfleet, put to sea and arrived at the island called Holy Isle. He was\r\neager as soon as possible, if he could escape the observation of the\r\nenemy, to get across to Eryx; disembark his stores; and having thus\r\nlightened his ships, take on board as marines those of the mercenary\r\ntroops who were suitable to the service, and Barcas with them; and\r\nnot to engage the enemy until he had thus reinforced himself. But\r\nLutatius was informed of the arrival of Hanno’s squadron, and correctly\r\ninterpreted their design. He at once took on board the best soldiers\r\nof his army, and crossed to the Island of Aegusa, which lies directly\r\nopposite Lilybaeum. There he addressed his forces some words suitable\r\nto the occasion, and gave full instructions to the pilots, with the\r\nunderstanding that a battle was to be fought on the morrow. At daybreak\r\nthe next morning Lutatius found that a strong breeze had sprung up on\r\nthe stern of the enemy, and that an advance towards them in the teeth\r\nof it would be difficult for his ships. The sea too was rough and\r\nboisterous: and for a while he could not make up his mind what he had\r\nbetter do in the circumstances. Finally, however, he was decided by the\r\nfollowing considerations. If he boarded the enemy’s fleet during the\r\ncontinuance of the storm, he would only have to contend with Hanno,\r\nand the levies of sailors which he had on board, before they could be\r\nreinforced by the troops, and with ships which were still heavily laden\r\nwith stores: but if he waited for calm weather, and allowed the enemy\r\nto get across and unite with their land forces, he would then have to\r\ncontend with ships lightened of their burden, and therefore in a more\r\nnavigable condition, and against the picked men of the land forces; and\r\nwhat was more formidable than anything else, against the determined\r\nbravery of Hamilcar. He made up his mind, therefore, not to let the\r\npresent opportunity slip; and when he saw the enemy’s ships crowding\r\nsail, he put to sea with all speed. The rowers, from their excellent\r\nphysical condition, found no difficulty in overcoming the heavy sea,\r\nand Lutatius soon got his fleet into single line with prows directed to\r\nthe foe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle of Aegusa.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victory of the Romans.]\r\n\r\n+61.+ When the Carthaginians saw that the Romans were intercepting\r\ntheir passage across, they lowered their masts, and after some words of\r\nmutual exhortation had been uttered in the several ships, closed with\r\ntheir opponents. But the respective state of equipment of the two sides\r\nwas exactly the converse of what it had been in the battle off Drepana;\r\nand the result of the battle was, therefore, naturally reversed also.\r\nThe Romans had reformed their mode of shipbuilding, and had eased\r\ntheir vessels of all freight, except the provisions necessary for the\r\nbattle: while their rowers having been thoroughly trained and got well\r\ntogether, performed their office in an altogether superior manner, and\r\nwere backed up by marines who, being picked men from the legions, were\r\nall but invincible. The case with the Carthaginians was exactly the\r\nreverse. Their ships were heavily laden and therefore unmanageable in\r\nthe engagement; while their rowers were entirely untrained, and merely\r\nput on board for the emergency; and such marines as they had were raw\r\nrecruits, who had never had any previous experience of any difficult or\r\ndangerous service. The fact is that the Carthaginian government never\r\nexpected that the Romans would again attempt to dispute the supremacy\r\nat sea: they had, therefore, in contempt for them, neglected their\r\nnavy. The result was that, as soon as they closed, their manifold\r\ndisadvantages quickly decided the battle against them. They had fifty\r\nships sunk, and seventy taken with their crews. The rest set their\r\nsails, and running before the wind, which luckily for them suddenly\r\nveered round at the nick of time to help them, got away again to Holy\r\nIsle. The Roman Consul sailed back to Lilybaeum to join the army, and\r\nthere occupied himself in making arrangements for the ships and men\r\nwhich he had captured; which was a business of considerable magnitude,\r\nfor the prisoners made in the battle amounted to little short of ten\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barcas makes terms.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The treaty, B.C. 242.]\r\n\r\n+62.+ As far as strength of feeling and desire for victory were\r\nconcerned, this unexpected reverse did not diminish the readiness of\r\nthe Carthaginians to carry on the war; but when they came to reckon up\r\ntheir resources they were at a complete standstill. On the one hand,\r\nthey could not any longer send supplies to their forces in Sicily,\r\nbecause the enemy commanded the sea: on the other, to abandon and, as\r\nit were, to betray these, left them without men and without leaders\r\nto carry on the war. They therefore sent a despatch to Barcas with\r\nall speed, leaving the decision of the whole matter in his hands.\r\nNor was their confidence misplaced. He acted the part of a gallant\r\ngeneral and a sensible man. As long as there was any reasonable hope\r\nof success in the business he had in hand, nothing was too adventurous\r\nor too dangerous for him to attempt; and if any general ever did so,\r\nhe put every chance of victory to the fullest proof. But when all his\r\nendeavours miscarried, and no reasonable expectation was left of saving\r\nhis troops, he yielded to the inevitable, and sent ambassadors to\r\ntreat of peace and terms of accommodation. And in this he showed great\r\ngood sense and practical ability; for it is quite as much the duty of\r\na leader to be able to see when it is time to give in, as when it is\r\nthe time to win a victory. Lutatius was ready enough to listen to the\r\nproposal, because he was fully aware that the resources of Rome were at\r\nthe lowest ebb from the strain of the war; and eventually it was his\r\nfortune to put an end to the contest by a treaty of which I here give\r\nthe terms. “_Friendship is established between the Carthaginians and\r\nRomans on the following terms, provided always that they are ratified\r\nby the Roman people. The Carthaginians shall evacuate the whole of\r\nSicily: they shall not make war upon Hiero, nor bear arms against the\r\nSyracusans or their allies. The Carthaginians shall give up to the\r\nRomans all prisoners without ransom. The Carthaginians shall pay to the\r\nRomans in twenty years 2200 Euboic talents of silver._”[142]\r\n\r\n+63.+ When this treaty was sent to Rome the people refused to accept\r\nit, but sent ten commissioners to examine into the business. Upon their\r\narrival they made no change in the general terms of the treaty, but\r\nthey introduced some slight alterations in the direction of increased\r\nseverity towards Carthage. Thus they reduced the time allowed for the\r\npayment of the indemnity by one half; they added a thousand talents to\r\nthe sum demanded; and extended the evacuation of Sicily to all islands\r\nlying between Sicily and Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greatness of the war.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the conditions on which the war was ended, after lasting\r\ntwenty-four years continuously. It was at once the longest, most\r\ncontinuous, and most severely contested war known to us in history.\r\nApart from the other battles fought and the preparations made, which\r\nI have described in my previous chapters, there were two sea fights,\r\nin one of which the combined numbers of the two fleets exceeded five\r\nhundred quinqueremes, in the other nearly approached seven hundred.\r\nIn the course of the war, counting what were destroyed by shipwreck,\r\nthe Romans lost seven hundred quinqueremes, the Carthaginians five\r\nhundred. Those therefore who have spoken with wonder of the sea-battles\r\nof an Antigonus, a Ptolemy, or a Demetrius, and the greatness of\r\ntheir fleets, would we may well believe have been overwhelmed with\r\nastonishment at the hugeness of these proportions if they had had\r\nto tell the story of this war.[143] If, further, we take into\r\nconsideration the superior size of the quinqueremes, compared with the\r\ntriremes employed by the Persians against the Greeks, and again by the\r\nAthenians and Lacedaemonians in their wars with each other, we shall\r\nfind that never in the whole history of the world have such enormous\r\nforces contended for mastery at sea.\r\n\r\nThese considerations will establish my original observation, and show\r\nthe falseness of the opinion entertained by certain Greeks. It was\r\n_not_ by mere chance or without knowing what they were doing that the\r\nRomans struck their bold stroke for universal supremacy and dominion,\r\nand justified their boldness by its success. No: it was the natural\r\nresult of discipline gained in the stern school of difficulty and\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n+64.+ And no doubt the question does naturally arise here as to why\r\nthey find it impossible in our days to man so many ships, or take\r\nthe sea with such large fleets, though masters of the world, and\r\npossessing a superiority over others many times as great as before.\r\nThe explanation of this difficulty will be clearly understood when\r\nwe come to the description of their civil constitution. I look\r\nupon this description as a most important part of my work, and one\r\ndemanding close attention on the part of my readers. For the subject\r\nis calculated to afford pleasure in the contemplation, and is up to\r\nthis time so to speak absolutely unknown, thanks to historians, some\r\nof whom have been ignorant, while others have given so confused an\r\naccount of it as to be practically useless. For the present it suffices\r\nto say that, as far as the late war was concerned, the two nations\r\nwere closely matched in the character of the designs they entertained,\r\nas well as in the lofty courage they showed in prosecuting them: and\r\nthis is especially true of the eager ambition displayed on either side\r\nto secure the supremacy. But in the individual gallantry of their\r\nmen the Romans had decidedly the advantage; while we must credit the\r\nCarthaginians with the best general of the day both for genius and\r\ndaring. I mean Hamilcar Barcas, own father of Rome’s future enemy\r\nHannibal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War between Rome and Falerii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mercenary war, B.C. 241.]\r\n\r\n+65.+ The confirmation of this peace was followed by events which\r\ninvolved both nations in a struggle of an identical or similar nature.\r\nAt Rome the late war was succeeded by a social war against the\r\nFaliscans, which, however, they brought to a speedy and successful\r\ntermination by the capture of Falerii after only a few days’ siege.\r\nThe Carthaginians were not so fortunate. Just about the same time\r\nthey found themselves confronted by three enemies at once, their own\r\nmercenaries, the Numidians, and such Libyans as joined the former\r\nin their revolt. And this war proved to be neither insignificant\r\nnor contemptible. It exposed them to frequent and terrible alarms;\r\nand, finally, it became a question to them not merely of a loss of\r\nterritory, but of their own bare existence, and of the safety of the\r\nvery walls and buildings of their city. There are many reasons that\r\nmake it worth while to dwell upon the history of this war: yet I must\r\ngive only a summary account of it, in accordance with the original plan\r\nof this work. The nature and peculiar ferocity of the struggle, which\r\nhas been generally called the “truceless war,” may be best learnt from\r\nits incidents. It conveys two important lessons: it most conspicuously\r\nshows those who employ mercenaries what dangers they should foresee\r\nand provide against; and secondly, it teaches how wide the distinction\r\nis between the character of troops composed of a confused mass of\r\nuncivilised tribes, and of those which have had the benefit of\r\neducation, the habits of social life, and the restraints of law. But\r\nwhat is of most importance to us is, that we may trace from the actual\r\nevents of this period the causes which led to the war between Rome and\r\nCarthage in the time of Hannibal. These causes have not only been a\r\nsubject of dispute among historians, but still continue to be so among\r\nthose who were actually engaged; it is therefore a matter of importance\r\nto enable students to form an opinion on this matter as nearly as\r\npossible in accordance with the truth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evacuation of Sicily.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mercenaries sent to Sicca.]\r\n\r\n+66.+ The course of events at Carthage subsequent to the peace was\r\nas follows: As soon as possible after it was finally ratified Barcas\r\nwithdrew the troops at Eryx to Lilybaeum, and then immediately laid\r\ndown his command. Gesco, who was commandant of the town, proceeded\r\nto transport the soldiers into Libya. But foreseeing what was likely\r\nto happen, he very prudently embarked them in detachments, and did\r\nnot send them all in one voyage. His object was to gain time for the\r\nCarthaginian government; so that one detachment should come to shore,\r\nreceive the pay due to them, and depart from Carthage to their own\r\ncountry, before the next detachment was brought across and joined\r\nthem. In accordance with this idea Gesco began the transportation of\r\nthe troops. But the Government—partly because the recent expenses\r\nhad reduced their finances to a low ebb, partly because they felt\r\ncertain that, if they collected the whole force and entertained them\r\nin Carthage, they would be able to persuade the mercenaries to accept\r\nsomething less than the whole pay due to them—did not dismiss the\r\ndetachments as they landed, but kept them massed in the city. But\r\nwhen this resulted in the commission of many acts of lawlessness by\r\nnight and day, they began to feel uneasy at their numbers and their\r\ngrowing licentiousness; and required the officers, until such time as\r\narrangements for discharging their pay should have been made, and the\r\nrest of the army should have arrived, to withdraw with all their men\r\nto a certain town called Sicca, receiving each a piece of gold for\r\ntheir immediate necessities. As far as quitting the city was concerned\r\nthey were ready enough to obey; but they desired to leave their heavy\r\nbaggage there as before, on the ground that they would soon have to\r\nreturn to the city for their wages. But the Carthaginian government\r\nwere in terror lest, considering the length of their absence and their\r\nnatural desire for the society of wives or children, they would either\r\nnot quit the city at all; or, if they did, would be sure to be enticed\r\nby these feelings to return, and that thus there would be no decrease\r\nof outrages in the city. Accordingly they forced them to take their\r\nbaggage with them: but it was sorely against the will of the men, and\r\nroused strong feelings of animosity among them. These mercenaries\r\nbeing forced to retire to Sicca, lived there as they chose without any\r\nrestraint upon their lawlessness. For they had obtained two things\r\nthe most demoralising for hired forces, and which in a word are in\r\nthemselves the all-sufficient source and origin of mutinies,—relaxation\r\nof discipline and want of employment.[144] For lack of something better\r\nto do, some of them began calculating, always to their own advantage,\r\nthe amount of pay owing to them; and thus making out the total to be\r\nmany times more than was really due, they gave out that this was the\r\namount which they ought to demand from the Carthaginians. Moreover they\r\nall began to call to mind the promises made to them by the generals\r\nin their harangues, delivered on various occasions of special danger,\r\nand to entertain high hopes and great expectations of the amount of\r\ncompensation which awaited them. The natural result followed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginning of the outbreak, B.C. 241.]\r\n\r\n+67.+ When the whole army had mustered at Sicca, and Hanno, now\r\nappointed general in Libya, far from satisfying these hopes and the\r\npromises they had received, talked on the contrary of the burden of\r\nthe taxes and the embarrassment of the public finances; and actually\r\nendeavoured to obtain from them an abatement even from the amount of\r\npay acknowledged to be due to them; excited and mutinous feelings at\r\nonce began to manifest themselves. There were constant conferences\r\nhastily got together, sometimes in separate nationalities, sometimes\r\nof the whole army; and there being no unity of race or language\r\namong them, the whole camp became a babel of confusion, a scene\r\nof inarticulate tumult, and a veritable revel of misrule. For the\r\nCarthaginians being always accustomed to employ mercenary troops of\r\nmiscellaneous nationalities, in securing that an army should consist\r\nof several different races, act wisely as far as the prevention of\r\nany rapid combinations for mutiny, or difficulty on the part of the\r\ncommanders in overawing insubordination, are concerned: but the\r\npolicy utterly breaks down when an outburst of anger, or popular\r\ndelusion, or internal dissension, has actually occurred; for it makes\r\nit impossible for the commander to soothe excited feelings, to remove\r\nmisapprehensions, or to show the ignorant their error. Armies in such a\r\nstate are not usually content with mere human wickedness; they end by\r\nassuming the ferocity of wild beasts and the vindictiveness of insanity.\r\n\r\nThis is just what happened in this case. There were in the army\r\nIberians and Celts, men from Liguria and the Balearic Islands, and\r\na considerable number of half-bred Greeks, mostly deserters and\r\nslaves; while the main body consisted of Libyans. Consequently it was\r\nimpossible to collect and address them _en masse_, or to approach\r\nthem with this view by any means whatever. There was no help for it:\r\nthe general could not possibly know their several languages; and to\r\nmake a speech four or five times on the same subject, by the mouths\r\nof several interpreters, was almost more impossible, if I may say so,\r\nthan that. The only alternative was for him to address his entreaties\r\nand exhortations to the soldiers through their officers. And this Hanno\r\ncontinually endeavoured to do. But there was the same difficulty with\r\nthem. Sometimes they failed to understand what he said: at others they\r\nreceived his words with expressions of approval to his face, and yet\r\nfrom error or malice reported them in a contrary sense to the common\r\nsoldiers. The result was a general scene of uncertainty, mistrust,\r\nand misunderstanding. And to crown all, they took it into their heads\r\nthat the Carthaginian government had a design in thus sending Hanno to\r\nthem: that they purposely did not send the generals who were acquainted\r\nwith the services they had rendered in Sicily, and who had been the\r\nauthors of the promises made to them; but had sent the one man who had\r\nnot been present at any of these transactions. Whether that were so or\r\nnot, they finally broke off all negotiations with Hanno; conceived a\r\nviolent mistrust of their several commanders; and in a furious outburst\r\nof anger with the Carthaginians started towards the city, and pitched\r\ntheir camp about a hundred and twenty stades from Carthage, at the town\r\nof Tunes, to the number of over twenty thousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mercenaries at Tunes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts to pacify them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The demands of the mercenaries.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dispute referred to the arbitration of Gesco.]\r\n\r\n+68.+ The Carthaginians saw their folly when it was too late. It was a\r\ngrave mistake to have collected so large a number of mercenaries into\r\none place without any warlike force of their own citizens to fall back\r\nupon: but it was a still graver mistake to have delivered up to them\r\ntheir children and wives, with their heavy baggage to boot; which they\r\nmight have retained as hostages, and thus have had greater security for\r\nconcerting their own measures, and more power of ensuring obedience to\r\ntheir orders. However, being thoroughly alarmed at the action of the\r\nmen in regard to their encampment, they went to every length in their\r\neagerness to pacify their anger. They sent them supplies of provisions\r\nin rich abundance, to be purchased exactly on their own terms, and\r\nat their own price. Members of the Senate were despatched, one after\r\nthe other, to treat with them; and they were promised that whatever\r\nthey demanded should be conceded if it were within the bounds of\r\npossibility. Day by day the ideas of the mercenaries rose higher. For\r\ntheir contempt became supreme when they saw the dismay and excitement\r\nin Carthage; their confidence in themselves was profound; and their\r\nengagements with the Roman legions in Sicily had convinced them, that\r\nnot only was it impossible for the Carthaginians to face them in the\r\nfield, but that it would be difficult to find any nation in the world\r\nwho could. Therefore, when the Carthaginians conceded the point of\r\ntheir pay, they made a further claim for the value of the horses they\r\nhad lost. When this too was conceded, they said that they ought to\r\nreceive the value of the rations of corn due to them from a long time\r\nprevious, reckoned at the highest price reached during the war. And\r\nin short, the ill-disposed and mutinous among them being numerous,\r\nthey always found out some new demand which made it impossible to\r\ncome to terms. Upon the Carthaginian government, however, pledging\r\nthemselves to the full extent of their powers, they eventually agreed\r\nto refer the matter to the arbitration of some one of the generals who\r\nhad been actually engaged in Sicily. Now they were displeased with\r\nHamilcar Barcas, who was one of those under whom they had fought in\r\nSicily, because they thought that their present unfavourable position\r\nwas attributable chiefly to him. They thought this from the fact that\r\nhe never came to them as an ambassador, and had, as was believed,\r\nvoluntarily resigned his command. But towards Gesco their feelings were\r\naltogether friendly. He had, as they thought, taken every possible\r\nprecaution for their interests, and especially in the arrangements for\r\ntheir conveyance to Libya. Accordingly they referred the dispute to the\r\narbitration of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spendius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathōs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spendius and Mathōs cause an outbreak.]\r\n\r\n+69.+ Gesco came to Tunes by sea, bringing the money with him. There he\r\nheld a meeting first of the officers, and then of the men, according\r\nto their nationalities; rebuked them for their past behaviour, and\r\nendeavoured to convince them as to their duty in the present: but\r\nmost of all he dwelt upon their obligation in the future to show\r\nthemselves well-disposed towards the people whose pay they had been\r\nso long enjoying. Finally, he proceeded to discharge the arrears of\r\npay, taking each nationality separately. But there was a certain\r\nCampanian in the army, a runaway Roman slave named Spendius, a man of\r\nextraordinary physical strength and reckless courage in the field.\r\nAlarmed lest his master should recover possession of him, and he should\r\nbe put to death with torture, in accordance with the laws of Rome,\r\nthis man exerted himself to the utmost in word and deed to break off\r\nthe arrangement with the Carthaginians. He was seconded by a Libyan\r\ncalled Mathōs, who was not a slave but free, and had actually served\r\nin the campaign. But he had been one of the most active agitators in\r\nthe late disturbances: and being in terror of punishment for the past,\r\nhe now gave in his adhesion to the party of Spendius; and taking the\r\nLibyans aside, suggested to them that, when the men of other races\r\nhad received their pay, and taken their departure to their several\r\ncountries, the Carthaginians would wreak upon them the full weight of\r\nthe resentment which they had, in common with themselves, incurred;\r\nand would look upon their punishment as a means of striking terror\r\ninto all the inhabitants of Libya. It did not take long to rouse the\r\nmen by such arguments, nor were they at a loss for a pretext, however\r\ninsignificant. In discharging the pay, Gesco postponed the payment\r\nof the valuations of rations and horses. This was enough: the men at\r\nonce hurried to make a meeting; Spendius and Mathōs delivered violent\r\ninvectives against Gesco and the Carthaginians; their words were\r\nreceived with every sign of approval; no one else could get a hearing;\r\nwhoever did attempt to speak was promptly stoned to death, without the\r\nassembly so much as waiting to ascertain whether he intended to support\r\nthe party of Spendius or no.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: βάλλε.]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of privates as well as officers were killed in\r\nthis manner in the various _émeutes_ which took place; and from the\r\nconstant repetition of this act of violence the whole army learnt the\r\nmeaning of the word “throw,” although there was not another word which\r\nwas intelligible to them all in common. The most usual occasion for\r\nthis to happen was when they collected in crowds flushed with wine\r\nafter their midday meal. On such occasions, if only some one started\r\nthe cry “throw,” such volleys were poured in from every side, and with\r\nsuch rapidity, that it was impossible for any one to escape who once\r\nventured to stand forward to address them. The result was that soon\r\nno one had the courage to offer them any counsel at all; and they\r\naccordingly appointed Mathōs and Spendius as their commanders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gesco and his staff seized and thrown into chains.]\r\n\r\n+70.+ This complete disorganisation and disorder did not escape\r\nthe observation of Gesco. But his chief anxiety was to secure the\r\nsafety of his country; and seeing clearly that, if these men were\r\ndriven to exasperation, the Carthaginians would be in danger of total\r\ndestruction, he exerted himself with desperate courage and persistence:\r\nsometimes summoning their officers, sometimes calling a meeting of\r\nthe men according to their nationalities and remonstrating with them.\r\nBut on one occasion the Libyans, not having received their wages as\r\nsoon as they considered that they ought to have been paid to them,\r\napproached Gesco himself with some insolence. With the idea of rebuking\r\ntheir precipitancy he refused to produce the pay, and bade them “go\r\nand ask their general Mathōs for it.” This so enraged them, that\r\nwithout a moment’s delay they first made a raid upon the money that\r\nwas kept in readiness, and then arrested Gesco and the Carthaginians\r\nwith him. Mathōs and Spendius thought that the speediest way to secure\r\nan outbreak of war was for the men to commit some outrage upon the\r\nsanctity of law and in violation of their engagements. They therefore\r\nco-operated with the mass of the men in their reckless outrages;\r\nplundered the baggage of the Carthaginians along with their money;\r\nmanacled Gesco and his staff with every mark of insolent violence,\r\nand committed them into custody. Thenceforth they were at open war\r\nwith Carthage, having bound themselves together by oaths which were at\r\nonce impious and contrary to the principles universally received among\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 240.]\r\n\r\nThis was the origin and beginning of the mercenary, or, as it is\r\nalso called, the Libyan war. Mathōs lost no time after this outrage\r\nin sending emissaries to the various cities in Libya, urging them to\r\nassert their freedom, and begging them to come to their aid and join\r\nthem in their undertaking. The appeal was successful: nearly all the\r\ncities in Libya readily listened to the proposal that they should\r\nrevolt against Carthage, and were soon zealously engaged in sending\r\nthem supplies and reinforcements. They therefore divided themselves\r\ninto two parties; one of which laid siege to Utica, the other to Hippo\r\nZarytus, because these two cities refused to participate in the revolt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Despair at Carthage.]\r\n\r\n+71.+ Three things must be noticed in regard to the Carthaginians.\r\nFirst, among them the means of life of private persons are supplied by\r\nthe produce of the land; secondly, all public expenses for war material\r\nand stores are discharged from the tribute paid by the people of Libya;\r\nand thirdly, it is their regular custom to carry on war by means\r\nof mercenary troops. At this moment they not only found themselves\r\nunexpectedly deprived of all these resources at once, but saw each one\r\nof them actually employed against themselves. Such an unlooked-for\r\nevent naturally reduced them to a state of great discouragement and\r\ndespair. After the long agony of the Sicilian war they were in hopes,\r\nwhen the peace was ratified, that they might obtain some breathing\r\nspace and some period of settled content. The very reverse was now\r\nbefalling them. They were confronted by an outbreak of war still more\r\ndifficult and formidable. In the former they were disputing with Rome\r\nfor the possession of Sicily: but this was a domestic war, and the\r\nissue at stake was the bare existence of themselves and their country.\r\nBesides, the many battles in which they had been engaged at sea had\r\nnaturally left them ill supplied with arms, sailors, and vessels.\r\nThey had no store of provisions ready, and no expectation whatever\r\nof external assistance from friends or allies. They were indeed now\r\nthoroughly taught the difference between a foreign war, carried on\r\nbeyond the seas, and a domestic insurrection and disturbance.\r\n\r\n+72.+ And for these overpowering miseries they had themselves to thank\r\nmore than any one else. During the late war they had availed themselves\r\nof what they regarded as a reasonable pretext for exercising their\r\nsupremacy over the inhabitants of Libya with excessive harshness. They\r\nhad exacted half of all agricultural produce; had doubled the tribute\r\nof the towns; and, in levying these contributions, had refused to show\r\nany grace or indulgence whatever to those who were in embarrassed\r\ncircumstances. Their admiration and rewards were reserved, not for\r\nthose generals who treated the people with mildness and humanity, but\r\nexclusively for those who like Hanno secured them the most abundant\r\nsupplies and war material, though at the cost of the harshest treatment\r\nof the provincials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of the country people.]\r\n\r\nThese people therefore needed no urging to revolt: a single messenger\r\nsufficed. The women, who up to this time had passively looked on\r\nwhile their husbands and fathers were being led off to prison for the\r\nnon-payment of the taxes, now bound themselves by an oath in their\r\nseveral towns that they would conceal nothing that they possessed;\r\nand, stripping off their ornaments, unreservedly contributed them to\r\nfurnish pay for the soldiers. They thus put such large means into the\r\nhands of Mathōs and Spendius, that they not only discharged the arrears\r\ndue to the mercenaries, which they had promised them as an inducement\r\nto mutiny, but remained well supplied for future needs. A striking\r\nillustration of the fact that true policy does not regard only the\r\nimmediate necessities of the hour, but must ever look still more keenly\r\nto the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanno’s management of the war.]\r\n\r\n+73.+ No such considerations, however, prevented the Carthaginians\r\nin their hour of distress from appointing Hanno general; because he\r\nhad the credit of having on a former occasion reduced the city called\r\nHecatompylos, in Libya, to obedience. They also set about collecting\r\nmercenaries; arming their own citizens who were of military age;\r\ntraining and drilling the city cavalry; and refitting what were left of\r\ntheir ships, triremes, penteconters, and the largest of the pinnaces.\r\nMeanwhile Mathōs, being joined by as many as seventy thousand Libyans,\r\ndistributed these fresh troops between the two forces which were\r\nbesieging Utica and Hippo Zarytus, and carried on those sieges without\r\nlet or hindrance. At the same time they kept firm possession of the\r\nencampment at Tunes, and had thus shut out the Carthaginians from\r\nthe whole of outer Libya. For Carthage itself stands on a projecting\r\npeninsula in a gulf, nearly surrounded by the sea and in part also by\r\na lake. The isthmus that connects it with Libya is three miles broad:\r\nupon one side of this isthmus, in the direction of the open sea and at\r\nno great distance, stands the city of Utica, and on the other stands\r\nTunes, upon the shore of the lake. The mercenaries occupied both\r\nthese points, and having thus cut off the Carthaginians from the open\r\ncountry, proceeded to take measures against Utica itself. They made\r\nfrequent excursions up to the town wall, sometimes by day and sometimes\r\nby night, and were continually throwing the citizens into a state of\r\nalarm and absolute panic.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fails to relieve Utica.]\r\n\r\n+74.+ Hanno, however, was busying himself with some success in\r\nproviding defences. In this department of a general’s duty he showed\r\nconsiderable ability; but he was quite a different man at the head of\r\na sally in force: he was not sagacious in his use of opportunities,\r\nand managed the whole business with neither skill nor promptitude. It\r\nwas thus that his first expedition miscarried when he went to relieve\r\nUtica. The number of his elephants, of which he had as many as a\r\nhundred, struck terror into the enemy; yet he made so poor a use of\r\nthis advantage that, instead of turning it into a complete victory,\r\nhe very nearly brought the besieged, as well as himself, to utter\r\ndestruction. He brought from Carthage catapults and darts, and in\r\nfact all the apparatus for a siege; and having encamped outside Utica\r\nundertook an assault upon the enemy’s entrenchment. The elephants\r\nforced their way into the camp, and the enemy, unable to withstand\r\ntheir weight and the fury of their attack, entirely evacuated the\r\nposition. They lost a large number from wounds inflicted by the\r\nelephants’ tusks; while the survivors made their way to a certain hill,\r\nwhich was a kind of natural fortification thickly covered with trees,\r\nand there halted, relying upon the strength of the position. But Hanno,\r\naccustomed to fight with Numidians and Libyans, who, once turned, never\r\nstay their flight till they are two days removed from the scene of the\r\naction, imagined that he had already put an end to the war and had\r\ngained a complete victory. He therefore troubled himself no more about\r\nhis men, or about the camp generally, but went inside the town and\r\noccupied himself with his own personal comfort. But the mercenaries,\r\nwho had fled in a body on to the hill, had been trained in the daring\r\ntactics of Barcas, and accustomed from their experience in the Sicilian\r\nwarfare to retreat and return again to the attack many times in the\r\nsame day. They now saw that the general had left his army and gone into\r\nthe town, and that the soldiers, owing to their victory, were behaving\r\ncarelessly, and in fact slipping out of the camp in various directions:\r\nthey accordingly got themselves into order and made an assault upon\r\nthe camp; killed a large number of the men; forced the rest to fly\r\nignominiously to the protection of the city walls and gates; and\r\npossessed themselves of all the baggage and apparatus belonging to the\r\nbesieged, which Hanno had brought outside the town in addition to his\r\nown, and thus put into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hanno’s continued ill success.]\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only instance of his incompetence. A few days\r\nafterwards, near a place called Gorza, he came right upon the enemy,\r\nwho lay encamped there, and had two opportunities of securing a\r\nvictory by pitched battles; and two more by surprising them, as they\r\nchanged quarters close to where he was. But in both cases he let the\r\nopportunities slip for want of care and proper calculation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamilcar Barcas takes the command.]\r\n\r\n+75.+ The Carthaginians, therefore, when they saw his mismanagement\r\nof the campaign, once more placed Hamilcar Barcas at the head of\r\naffairs; and despatched him to the war as commander-in-chief, with\r\nseventy elephants, the newly-collected mercenaries, and the deserters\r\nfrom the enemy; and along with them the cavalry and infantry enrolled\r\nfrom the citizens themselves, amounting in all to ten thousand men.\r\nHis appearance from the first produced an immediate impression. The\r\nexpedition was unexpected; and he was thus able, by the dismay which\r\nit produced, to lower the courage of the enemy. He succeeded in\r\nraising the siege of Utica, and showed himself worthy of his former\r\nachievements, and of the confidence felt in him by the people. What he\r\naccomplished on this service was this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He gets his men across the Macaras.]\r\n\r\nA chain of hills runs along the isthmus connecting Carthage with the\r\nmainland, which are difficult of access, and are crossed by artificial\r\npasses into the mainland; of these hills Mathōs had occupied all the\r\navailable points and posted guards there. Besides these there is a\r\nriver called Macaras (Bagradas), which at certain points interrupts\r\nthe passage of travellers from the city to the mainland, and though\r\nfor the most part impassable, owing to the strength of its stream,\r\nis only crossed by one bridge. This means of egress also Mathōs was\r\nguarding securely, and had built a town on it. The result was that, to\r\nsay nothing of the Carthaginians entering the mainland with an army,\r\nit was rendered exceedingly difficult even for private individuals,\r\nwho might wish to make their way through, to elude the vigilance of\r\nthe enemy. This did not escape the observation and care of Hamilcar;\r\nand while revolving every means and every chance of putting an end to\r\nthis difficulty about a passage, he at length hit upon the following.\r\nHe observed that where the river discharges itself into the sea its\r\nmouth got silted up in certain positions of the wind, and that then\r\nthe passage over the river at its mouth became like that over a marsh.\r\nHe accordingly got everything ready in the camp for the expedition,\r\nwithout telling any one what he was going to do; and then watched\r\nfor this state of things to occur. When the right moment arrived,\r\nhe started under cover of night; and by daybreak had, without being\r\nobserved by any one, got his army across this place, to the surprise\r\nof the citizens of Utica as well as of the enemy. Marching across the\r\nplain, he led his men straight against the enemy who were guarding the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And defeats Spendius.]\r\n\r\n+76.+ When he understood what had taken place Spendius advanced into\r\nthe plain to meet Hamilcar. The force from the city at the bridge\r\namounted to ten thousand men; that from before Utica to more than\r\nfifteen thousand men; both of which now advanced to support each\r\nother. When they had effected a junction they imagined that they\r\nhad the Carthaginians in a trap, and therefore with mutual words of\r\nexhortation passed the order to engage, and at once commenced. Hamilcar\r\nwas marching with his elephants in front, his cavalry and light troops\r\nnext, while his heavy armed hoplites brought up the rear. But when he\r\nsaw the precipitation of the enemy’s attack, he passed the word to\r\nhis men to turn to the rear. His instructions were that the troops in\r\nfront should, after thus turning to the rear, retire with all speed:\r\nwhile he again wheeled to the right about what had been originally\r\nhis rear divisions, and got them into line successively so as to face\r\nthe enemy. The Libyans and mercenaries mistook the object of this\r\nmovement, and imagined that the Carthaginians were panic-stricken and\r\nin full retreat. Thereupon they broke from their ranks and, rushing\r\nforward, began a vigorous hand to hand struggle. When, however, they\r\nfound that the cavalry had wheeled round again, and were drawn up close\r\nto the hoplites, and that the rest of the army also was being brought\r\nup, surprise filled the Libyans with panic; they immediately turned\r\nand began a retreat as precipitate and disorderly as their advance.\r\nIn the blind flight which followed some of them ran foul of their own\r\nrear-guard, who were still advancing, and caused their own destruction\r\nor that of their comrades; but the greater part were trampled to death\r\nby the cavalry and elephants who immediately charged. As many as six\r\nthousand of the Libyans and foreign troops were killed, and about two\r\nthousand taken prisoners. The rest made good their escape, either to\r\nthe town on the bridge or to the camp near Utica. After this victory\r\nHamilcar followed close upon the heels of the enemy, carried the town\r\non the bridge by assault, the enemy there abandoning it and flying to\r\nTunes, and then proceeded to scour the rest of the district: some of\r\nthe towns submitting, while the greater number he had to reduce by\r\nforce. And thus he revived in the breasts of the Carthaginians some\r\nlittle spirit and courage, or at least rescued them from the state of\r\nabsolute despair into which they had fallen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathōs harasses Hamilcar’s march.]\r\n\r\n+77.+ Meanwhile Mathōs himself was continuing the siege of Hippo\r\nZarytus, and he now counselled Autaritus, the leader of the Gauls,\r\nand Spendius to stick close to the skirts of the enemy, avoiding\r\nthe plains, because the enemy were strong in cavalry and elephants,\r\nbut marching parallel with them on the slopes of the mountains,\r\nand attacking them whenever they saw them in any difficulty. While\r\nsuggesting these tactics, he at the same time sent messengers to the\r\nNumidians and Libyans, entreating them to come to their aid, and not to\r\nlet slip the opportunity of securing their own freedom. Accordingly,\r\nSpendius took with him a force of six thousand men, selected from each\r\nof the several nationalities at Tunes, and started, keeping along a\r\nline of hills parallel to the Carthaginians. Besides these six thousand\r\nhe had two thousand Gauls under Autaritus, who were all that were\r\nleft of the original number, the rest having deserted to the Romans\r\nduring the period of the occupation of Eryx. Now it happened that, just\r\nwhen Hamilcar had taken up a position in a certain plain which was\r\nsurrounded on all sides by mountains, the reinforcements of Numidians\r\nand Libyans joined Spendius. The Carthaginians, therefore, suddenly\r\nfound a Libyan encampment right on their front, another of Numidians\r\non their rear, and that of Spendius on their flank; and it seemed\r\nimpossible to escape from the danger which thus menaced them on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hamilcar is joined by the Numidian Narávas.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Again defeats Spendius.]\r\n\r\n+78.+ But there was at that time a certain Narávas, a Numidian of\r\nhigh rank and warlike spirit, who entertained an ancestral feeling of\r\naffection for the Carthaginians, rendered especially warm at that time\r\nby admiration for Hamilcar. He now thought that he had an excellent\r\nopportunity for an interview and association with that general; and\r\naccordingly came to the Carthaginian quarters with a body of a hundred\r\nNumidians, and boldly approaching the out-works, remained there waving\r\nhis hand. Wondering what his object could be Hamilcar sent a horseman\r\nto see; to whom Narávas said that he wished for an interview with\r\nthe general. The Carthaginian leader still showing hesitation and\r\nincredulity, Narávas committed his horse and javelins to the care of\r\nhis guards, and boldly came into the camp unarmed. His fearlessness\r\nmade a profound impression not unmixed with surprise. No further\r\nobjection, however, was made to his presence, and the desired interview\r\nwas accorded; in which he declared his goodwill to the Carthaginians\r\ngenerally, and his especial desire to be friends with Barcas. “This\r\nwas the motive of his presence,” he said; “he was come with the full\r\nintention of taking his place by his side and of faithfully sharing\r\nall his actions and undertakings.” Hamilcar, on hearing these words,\r\nwas so immensely charmed by the young man’s courage in coming, and\r\nhis honest simplicity in the interview, that he not only consented to\r\naccept his co-operation, but promised also with an oath that he would\r\ngive him his daughter in marriage if he kept faith with Carthage to\r\nthe end. The agreement having been thus made, Narávas came with his\r\ndivision of Numidians, numbering two thousand. Thus reinforced Hamilcar\r\noffered the enemy battle; which Spendius, having joined forces with\r\nthe Libyans, accepted; and descending into the plain engaged the\r\nCarthaginians. In the severe battle which followed Hamilcar’s army was\r\nvictorious: a result which he owed partly to the excellent behaviour\r\nof the elephants, but particularly to the brilliant services rendered\r\nby Narávas. Autaritus and Spendius managed to escape; but of the rest\r\nas many as ten thousand were killed and four thousand taken prisoners.\r\nWhen the victory was complete, Hamilcar gave permission to those of\r\nthe prisoners who chose to enlist in his army, and furnished them with\r\narms from the spoils of the enemy’s slain: those who did not choose to\r\naccept this offer he summoned to a meeting and harangued them. He told\r\nthem that the crimes committed by them up to that moment were pardoned,\r\nand they were permitted to go their several ways, wheresoever they\r\nchose, but on condition that none of them bore arms against Carthage\r\nagain: if any one of them were ever caught so doing, he warned them\r\ndistinctly that he would meet with no mercy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutiny in Sardinia.]\r\n\r\n+79.+ This conspiracy of Mathōs and Spendius caused an outbreak about\r\nthis same time in another quarter. For the mercenaries who were\r\nin garrison in Sardinia, inspired by their example, attacked the\r\nCarthaginians in the island; beleaguered Bostarus, the commander of\r\nthe foreign contingent, in the citadel; and finally put him and his\r\ncompatriots to the sword. The Carthaginians thereupon sent another army\r\ninto the island under Hanno. But the men deserted to the mutineers; who\r\nthen seized Hanno and crucified him, and exercising all their ingenuity\r\nin the invention of tortures racked to death every Carthaginian in\r\nthe island. Having got the towns into their power, they thenceforth\r\nkept forcible possession of the island; until they quarrelled with the\r\nnatives and were driven by them into Italy. This was the way in which\r\nCarthage lost Sardinia, an island of first rate importance from its\r\nsize, the number of its inhabitants, and its natural products. But as\r\nmany have described it at great length, I do not think that I need\r\nrepeat statements about which there is no manner of dispute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 239. Plan of Spendius for doing away with the good\r\nimpression made by the leniency of Barcas.]\r\n\r\nTo return to Libya. The indulgence shown by Hamilcar to the captives\r\nalarmed Mathōs and Spendius and Autaritus the Gaul. They were afraid\r\nthat conciliatory treatment of this sort would induce the Libyans,\r\nand the main body of the mercenaries, to embrace with eagerness the\r\nimpunity thus displayed before their eyes. They consulted together,\r\ntherefore, how they might by some new act of infamy inflame to\r\nthe highest pitch of fury the feelings of their men against the\r\nCarthaginians. They finally determined upon the following plan. They\r\nsummoned a meeting of the soldiers; and when it was assembled, they\r\nintroduced a bearer of a despatch which they represented to have been\r\nsent by their fellow conspirators in Sardinia. The despatch warned them\r\nto keep a careful watch over Gesco and all his fellow prisoners (whom,\r\nas has been stated, they had treacherously seized in Tunes), as certain\r\npersons in the camp were secretly negotiating with the Carthaginians\r\nfor their release. Taking this as his text, Spendius commenced by\r\nurging the men not to put any trust in the indulgence shown by the\r\nCarthaginian general to the prisoners of war, “For,” said he, “it is\r\nwith no intention of saving their lives that he adopted this course\r\nin regard to the prisoners; his aim was, by releasing them, to get\r\nus into his power, that punishment might not be confined to some of\r\nus, but might fall on all at once.” He went on to urge them to be on\r\ntheir guard, lest by letting Gesco’s party go they should teach their\r\nenemies to despise them; and should also do great practical damage to\r\ntheir own interests, by suffering a man to escape who was an excellent\r\ngeneral, and likely to be a most formidable enemy to themselves. Before\r\nhe had finished this speech another courier arrived, pretending to have\r\nbeen sent by the garrison at Tunes, and bearing a despatch containing\r\nwarnings similar to that from Sardinia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of Gesco.]\r\n\r\n+80.+ It was now the turn of Autaritus the Gaul. “Your only hope,”\r\nhe said, “of safety is to reject all hopes which rest on the\r\nCarthaginians. So long as any man clings to the idea of indulgence\r\nat their hands, he cannot possibly be a genuine ally of yours. Never\r\ntrust, never listen, never attend to anyone, unless he recommend\r\nunrelenting hostility and implacable hatred towards the Carthaginians:\r\nall who speak on the other side regard as traitors and enemies.” After\r\nthis preface, he gave it as his advice that they should put to death\r\nwith torture both Gesco and those who had been seized with him, as\r\nwell as the Carthaginian prisoners of war who had been captured since.\r\nNow this Autaritus was the most effective speaker of any, because he\r\ncould make himself understood to a large number of those present at\r\na meeting. For, owing to his length of service, he knew how to speak\r\nPhoenician; and Phoenician was the language in which the largest number\r\nof men, thanks to the length of the late war, could listen to with\r\nsatisfaction. Accordingly his speech was received with acclamation, and\r\nhe stood down amidst loud applause. But when many came forward from the\r\nseveral nationalities at the same time; and, moved by Gesco’s former\r\nkindnesses to themselves, would have deprecated at least the infliction\r\nof torture, not a word of what they said was understood: partly because\r\nmany were speaking at the same time, and partly because each spoke in\r\nhis own language. But when at length it was disclosed that what they\r\nmeant was to dissuade the infliction of torture, upon one of those\r\npresent shouting out “Throw!” they promptly stoned to death all who had\r\ncome forward to speak; and their relations buried their bodies, which\r\nwere crushed into shapeless masses as though by the feet of elephants.\r\nStill they at least were buried. But the followers of Spendius now\r\nseized Gesco and his fellow prisoners, numbering about seven hundred,\r\nled them outside the stockade, and having made them march a short\r\ndistance from the camp, first cut off their hands, beginning with\r\nGesco, the man whom a short while before they had selected out of all\r\nCarthage as their benefactor and had chosen as arbitrator in their\r\ncontroversy. When they had cut off their hands, they proceeded to lop\r\noff the extremities of the unhappy men, and having thus mutilated them\r\nand broken their legs, they threw them still alive into a trench.\r\n\r\n+81.+ When news of this dreadful affair reached the Carthaginians, they\r\nwere powerless indeed to do anything, but they were filled with horror;\r\nand in a transport of agony despatched messengers to Hamilcar and the\r\nsecond general Hanno, entreating them to rally to their aid and avenge\r\nthe unhappy victims; and at the same time they sent heralds to the\r\nauthors of this crime to negotiate for the recovery of the dead bodies.\r\nBut the latter sternly refused; and warned the messengers to send\r\nneither herald nor ambassador to them again; for the same punishment\r\nwhich had just befallen Gesco awaited all who came. And for the future\r\nthey passed a resolution, which they encouraged each other to observe,\r\nto put every Carthaginian whom they caught to death with torture; and\r\nthat whenever they captured one of their auxiliaries they would cut\r\noff his hands and send him back to Carthage. And this resolution they\r\nexactly and persistently carried out. Such horrors justify the remark\r\nthat it is not only the bodies of men, and the ulcers and imposthumes\r\nwhich are bred in them, that grow to a fatal and completely incurable\r\nstate of inflammation, but their souls also most of all. For as in\r\nthe case of ulcers, sometimes medical treatment on the one hand only\r\nserves to irritate them and make them spread more rapidly, while if,\r\non the other hand, the medical treatment is stopped, having nothing\r\nto check their natural destructiveness, they gradually destroy the\r\nsubstance on which they feed; just so at times it happens that similar\r\nplague spots and gangrenes fasten upon men’s souls; and when this is\r\nso, no wild beast can be more wicked or more cruel than a man. To men\r\nin such a frame of mind if you show indulgence or kindness, they regard\r\nit as a cover for trickery and sinister designs, and only become more\r\nsuspicious and more inflamed against the authors of it; while if you\r\nretaliate, their passions are aroused to a kind of dreadful rivalry,\r\nand then there is no crime too monstrous or too cruel for them to\r\ncommit. The upshot with these men was, that their feelings became so\r\nbrutalised that they lost the instincts of humanity: which we must\r\nascribe in the first place, and to the greatest extent, to uncivilised\r\nhabits and a wretchedly bad early training; but many other things\r\ncontributed to this result, and among them we must reckon as most\r\nimportant the acts of violence and rapacity committed by their leaders,\r\nsins which at that time were prevalent among the whole mercenary body,\r\nbut especially so with their leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Quarrels of Hanno and Hamilcar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Hippo Zarytus and Utica.]\r\n\r\n+82.+ Alarmed by the recklessness displayed by the enemy, Hamilcar\r\nsummoned Hanno to join him, being convinced that a consolidation of\r\nthe two armies would give him the best chance of putting an end to\r\nthe whole war. Such of the enemy as he took in the field he put to\r\nexecution on the spot, while those who were made prisoners and brought\r\nto him he threw to the elephants to be trampled to death; for he now\r\nmade up his mind that the only possibility of finishing the war was\r\nto entirely destroy the enemy. But just as the Carthaginians were\r\nbeginning to entertain brighter hopes in regard to the war, a reverse\r\nas complete as it was unexpected brought their fortunes to the lowest\r\nebb. For these two generals, when they had joined forces, quarrelled so\r\nbitterly with each other, that they not only omitted to take advantage\r\nof chances against the enemy, but by their mutual animosity gave the\r\nenemy many opportunities against themselves. Finding this to be the\r\ncase, the Carthaginian government sent out instructions that one of the\r\ngenerals was to retire, the other to remain, and that the army itself\r\nwas to decide which of them it should be. This was one cause of the\r\nreverse in the fortunes of Carthage at this time. Another, which was\r\nalmost contemporaneous, was this. Their chief hope of furnishing the\r\narmy with provisions and other necessaries rested upon the supplies\r\nthat were being brought from a place to which they give the name of\r\nEmporiae: but as these supplies were on their way, they were overtaken\r\nby a storm at sea and entirely destroyed. This was all the more fatal\r\nbecause Sardinia was lost to them at the time, as we have seen,\r\nand that island had always been of the greatest service to them in\r\ndifficulties of this sort. But the worst blow of all was the revolt of\r\nthe cities of Hippo Zarytus and Utica, the only cities in all Libya\r\nthat had been faithful to them, not only in the present war, but also\r\nat the time of the invasion of Agathocles, as well as that of the\r\nRomans. To both these latter they had offered a gallant resistance;\r\nand, in short, had never at any time adopted any policy hostile to\r\nCarthage. But now they were not satisfied with simply revolting to\r\nthe Libyans, without any reason to allege for their conduct. With all\r\nthe bitterness of turncoats, they suddenly paraded an ostentatious\r\nfriendship and fidelity to them, and gave practical expression to\r\nimplacable rage and hatred towards the Carthaginians. They killed every\r\nman of the force which had come from Carthage to their aid, as well as\r\nits commander, and threw the bodies from the wall. They surrendered\r\ntheir town to the Libyans, while they even refused the request of the\r\nCarthaginians to be allowed to bury the corpses of their unfortunate\r\nsoldiers. Mathōs and Spendius were so elated by these events that\r\nthey were emboldened to attempt Carthage itself. But Barcas had now\r\ngot Hannibal as his coadjutor, who had been sent by the citizens\r\nto the army in the place of Hanno,—recalled in accordance with the\r\nsentence of the army, which the government had left to their discretion\r\nin reference to the disputes that arose between the two generals.\r\nAccompanied, therefore, by this Hannibal and by Narávas, Hamilcar\r\nscoured the country to intercept the supplies of Mathōs and Spendius,\r\nreceiving his most efficient support in this, as in other things, from\r\nthe Numidian Narávas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Friendly disposition of Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hiero of Syracuse.]\r\n\r\n+83.+ Such being the position of their forces in the field, the\r\nCarthaginians, finding themselves hemmed in on every side, were\r\ncompelled to have recourse to the help of the free states in alliance\r\nwith them.[145] Now Hiero, of Syracuse, had during this war been all\r\nalong exceedingly anxious to do everything which the Carthaginians\r\nasked him; and at this point of it was more forward to do so than\r\never, from a conviction that it was for his interest, with a view\r\nalike to his own sovereignty and to his friendship with Rome, that\r\nCarthage should not perish, and so leave the superior power to work\r\nits own will without resistance. And his reasoning was entirely sound\r\nand prudent. It is never right to permit such a state of things; nor\r\nto help any one to build up so preponderating a power as to make\r\nresistance to it impossible, however just the cause. Not that the\r\nRomans themselves had failed to observe the obligations of the treaty,\r\nor were showing any failure of friendly dispositions; though at first\r\na question had arisen between the two powers, from the following\r\ncircumstance. At the beginning of the war, certain persons sailing from\r\nItaly with provisions for the mutineers, the Carthaginians captured\r\nthem and forced them to land in their own harbour; and presently had\r\nas many as five hundred such persons in their prisons. This caused\r\nconsiderable annoyance at Rome: but, after sending ambassadors to\r\nCarthage and recovering possession of the men by diplomatic means, the\r\nRomans were so much gratified that, by way of returning the favour,\r\nthey restored the prisoners made in the Sicilian war whom they still\r\nretained; and from that time forth responded cheerfully and generously\r\nto all requests made to them. They allowed their merchants to export\r\nto Carthage whatever from time to time was wanted, and prohibited\r\nthose who were exporting to the mutineers. When, subsequently, the\r\nmercenaries in Sardinia, having revolted from Carthage, invited their\r\ninterference on the island, they did not respond to the invitation; nor\r\nwhen the people of Utica offered them their submission did they accept\r\nit, but kept strictly to the engagements contained in the treaty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238. Hamilcar, with assistance from Sicily, surrounds\r\nMathōs and Spendius.]\r\n\r\n+84.+ The assistance thus obtained from these allies encouraged the\r\nCarthaginians to maintain their resistance: while Mathōs and Spendius\r\nfound themselves quite as much in the position of besieged as in that\r\nof besiegers; for Hamilcar’s force reduced them to such distress\r\nfor provisions that they were at last compelled to raise the siege.\r\nHowever, after a short interval, they managed to muster the most\r\neffective of the mercenaries and Libyans, to the number in all of fifty\r\nthousand, among whom, besides others, was Zarzas the Libyan, with his\r\ndivision, and commenced once more to watch and follow on the flank of\r\nHamilcar’s march. Their method was to keep away from the level country,\r\nfor fear of the elephants and the cavalry of Narávas; but to seize in\r\nadvance of him all points of vantage, whether it were rising ground or\r\nnarrow pass. In these operations they showed themselves quite a match\r\nfor their opponents in the fury of their assault and the gallantry of\r\ntheir attempts; but their ignorance of military tactics frequently\r\nplaced them at a disadvantage. It was, in fact, a real and practical\r\nillustration of the difference between scientific and unscientific\r\nwarfare: between the art of a general and the mechanical movements of\r\na soldier. Like a good draught-player, by isolating and surrounding\r\nthem, he destroyed large numbers in detail without coming to a general\r\nengagement at all; and in movements of more importance he cut off\r\nmany without resistance by enticing them into ambushes; while he\r\nthrew others into utter dismay by suddenly appearing where they least\r\nexpected him, sometimes by day and sometimes by night: and all whom he\r\ntook alive he threw to the elephants. Finally, he managed unexpectedly\r\nto beleaguer them on ground highly unfavourable to them and convenient\r\nfor his own force; and reduced them to such a pitch of distress that,\r\nneither venturing to risk an engagement nor being able to run away,\r\nbecause they were entirely surrounded by a trench and stockade, they\r\nwere at last compelled by starvation to feed on each other: a fitting\r\nretribution at the hands of Providence for their violation of all laws\r\nhuman and divine in their conduct to their enemies. To sally forth to\r\nan engagement they did not dare, for certain defeat stared them in the\r\nface, and they knew what vengeance awaited them if they were taken; and\r\nas to making terms, it never occurred to them to mention it, they were\r\nconscious that they had gone too far for that. They still hoped for the\r\narrival of relief from Tunes, of which their officers assured them, and\r\naccordingly shrank from no suffering however terrible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spendius and Autaritus fall into the hands of Hamilcar.]\r\n\r\n+85.+ But when they had used up for food the captives in this horrible\r\nmanner, and then the bodies of their slaves, and still no one came to\r\ntheir relief from Tunes, their sufferings became too dreadful to bear;\r\nand the common soldiers broke out into open threats of violence against\r\ntheir officers. Thereupon Autaritus, Zarzas, and Spendius decided\r\nto put themselves into the hands of the enemy and to hold a parley\r\nwith Hamilcar, and try to make terms. They accordingly sent a herald\r\nand obtained permission for the despatch of an embassy. It consisted\r\nof ten ambassadors, who, on their arrival at the Carthaginian camp,\r\nconcluded an agreement with Hamilcar on these terms: “The Carthaginians\r\nmay select any ten men they choose from the enemy, and allow the rest\r\nto depart with one tunic a-piece.” No sooner had these terms been\r\nagreed to, than Hamilcar said at once that he selected, according\r\nto the terms of the agreement, the ten ambassadors themselves. The\r\nCarthaginians thus got possession of Autaritus, Spendius, and the other\r\nmost conspicuous officers. The Libyans saw that their officers were\r\narrested, and not knowing the terms of the treaty, believed that some\r\nperfidy was being practised against them, and accordingly flew to seize\r\ntheir arms. Hamilcar thereupon surrounded them with his elephants and\r\nhis entire force, and destroyed them to a man. This slaughter, by which\r\nmore than forty thousand perished, took place near a place called the\r\nSaw, so named from its shape resembling that tool.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Mathōs in Tunes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat and death of Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n+86.+ This achievement of Hamilcar revived the hopes of the\r\nCarthaginians who had been in absolute despair: while he, in\r\nconjunction with Narávas and Hannibal, employed himself in traversing\r\nthe country and visiting the cities. His victory secured the submission\r\nof the Libyans; and when they had come in, and the greater number of\r\nthe towns had been reduced to obedience, he and his colleagues advanced\r\nto attack Tunes, and commenced besieging Mathōs. Hannibal pitched his\r\ncamp on the side of the town nearest to Carthage, and Hamilcar on the\r\nopposite side. When this was done they brought the captives taken from\r\nthe army of Spendius and crucified them in the sight of the enemy. But\r\nobserving that Hannibal was conducting his command with negligence and\r\nover-confidence, Mathōs assaulted the ramparts, killed many of the\r\nCarthaginians, and drove the entire army from the camp. All the baggage\r\nfell into the hands of the enemy, and Hannibal himself was made a\r\nprisoner. They at once took him up to the cross on which Spendius was\r\nhanging, and after the infliction of exquisite tortures, took down the\r\nlatter’s body and fastened Hannibal, still living, to his cross; and\r\nthen slaughtered thirty Carthaginians of the highest rank round the\r\ncorpse of Spendius. It seemed as though Fortune designed a competition\r\nin cruelty, giving either side alternately the opportunity of outdoing\r\nthe other in mutual vengeance. Owing to the distance of the two camps\r\nfrom each other it was late before Barcas discovered the attack made\r\nfrom the town; nor, when he had discovered it, could he even then go to\r\nthe rescue with the necessary speed, because the intervening country\r\nwas rugged and difficult. He therefore broke up his camp, and leaving\r\nTunes marched down the bank of the river Macaras, and pitched his camp\r\nclose to its mouth and to the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: By a final effort the Carthaginians raise a reinforcement\r\nfor Hamilcar.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mathōs beaten and captured.]\r\n\r\n+87.+ This unexpected reverse reduced the Carthaginians once more to\r\na melancholy state of despair. But though their recent elation of\r\nspirit was followed so closely by this depression, they did not fail\r\nto do what they could for their own preservation. They selected thirty\r\nmembers of the Senate; with them they associated Hanno, who had some\r\ntime ago been recalled; and, arming all that were left of military\r\nage in the city, despatched them to Barcas, with the feeling that\r\nthey were now making their supreme effort. They strictly charged the\r\nmembers of the Senate to use every effort to reconcile the two generals\r\nHamilcar and Hanno, and to make them forget their old quarrel and act\r\nharmoniously, in view of the imminence of the danger. Accordingly,\r\nafter the employment of many various arguments, they induced the\r\ngenerals to meet; and Hanno and Barcas were compelled to give in\r\nand yield to their representations. The result was that they ever\r\nafterwards co-operated with each other so cordially, that Mathōs found\r\nhimself continually worsted in the numerous skirmishes which took place\r\nround the town called Leptis, as well as certain other towns; and at\r\nlast became eager to bring the matter to the decision of a general\r\nengagement, a desire in which the Carthaginians also shared in an equal\r\ndegree. Both sides therefore having determined upon this course: they\r\nsummoned all their allies to join them in confronting the peril, and\r\ncollected the garrisons stationed in the various towns, conscious that\r\nthey were about to stake their all on the hazard. All being ready on\r\neither side for the conflict, they gave each other battle by mutual\r\nconsent, both sides being drawn up in full military array. When victory\r\ndeclared itself on the side of the Carthaginians, the larger number of\r\nthe Libyans perished on the field; and the rest, having escaped to a\r\ncertain town, surrendered shortly afterwards; while Mathōs himself was\r\ntaken prisoner by his enemies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reduction of Hippo and Utica, B.C. 238.]\r\n\r\n+88.+ Most places in Libya submitted to Carthage after this battle.\r\nBut the towns of Hippo and Utica still held out, feeling that they had\r\nno reasonable grounds for obtaining terms, because their original acts\r\nof hostility left them no place for mercy or pardon. So true is it\r\nthat even in such outbreaks, however criminal in themselves, it is of\r\ninestimable advantage to be moderate, and to refrain from wanton acts\r\nwhich commit their perpetrator beyond all power of forgiveness. Nor did\r\ntheir attitude of defiance help these cities. Hanno invested one and\r\nBarcas the other, and quickly reduced them to accept whatever terms the\r\nCarthaginians might determine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 241-238.]\r\n\r\nThe war with the Libyans had indeed reduced Carthage to dreadful\r\ndanger; but its termination enabled her not only to re-establish her\r\nauthority over Libya, but also to inflict condign punishment upon the\r\nauthors of the revolt. For the last act in the drama was performed by\r\nthe young men conducting a triumphal procession through the town, and\r\nfinally inflicting every kind of torture upon Mathōs. For three years\r\nand about four months did the mercenaries maintain a war against the\r\nCarthaginians which far surpassed any that I ever heard of for cruelty\r\nand inhumanity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans interfere in Sardinia.]\r\n\r\nAnd about the same time the Romans took in hand a naval expedition to\r\nSardinia upon the request of the mercenaries who had deserted from\r\nthat island and come to Italy; and when the Carthaginians expressed\r\nindignation at this, on the ground that the lordship over Sardinia\r\nmore properly belonged to them, and were preparing to take measures\r\nagainst those who caused the revolt of the island, the Romans voted\r\nto declare war against them, on the pretence that they were making\r\nwarlike preparations, not against Sardinia, but against themselves. The\r\nCarthaginians, however, having just had an almost miraculous escape\r\nfrom annihilation in the recent war, were in every respect disabled\r\nfrom renewing their quarrel with the Romans. They therefore yielded to\r\nthe necessities of the hour, and not only abandoned Sardinia, but paid\r\nthe Romans twelve hundred talents into the bargain, that they might not\r\nbe obliged to undertake the war for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation of the subjects treated in Book I.]\r\n\r\n+1.+ In the previous book I have described how the Romans, having\r\nsubdued all Italy, began to aim at foreign dominion; how they crossed\r\nto Sicily, and the reasons of the war which they entered into against\r\nthe Carthaginians for the possession of that island. Next I stated at\r\nwhat period they began the formation of a navy; and what befell both\r\nthe one side and the other up to the end of the war; the consequence\r\nof which was that the Carthaginians entirely evacuated Sicily, and the\r\nRomans took possession of the whole island, except such parts as were\r\nstill under the rule of Hiero. Following these events I endeavoured to\r\ndescribe how the mutiny of the mercenaries against Carthage, in what\r\nis called the Libyan War, burst out; the lengths to which the shocking\r\noutrages in it went; its surprises and extraordinary incidents, until\r\nits conclusion, and the final triumph of Carthage. I must now relate\r\nthe events which immediately succeeded these, touching summarily upon\r\neach in accordance with my original plan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238, Hamilcar and his son Hannibal sent to Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238-229.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had brought the Libyan war to a conclusion the\r\nCarthaginian government collected an army and despatched it under the\r\ncommand of Hamilcar to Iberia. This general took over the command of\r\nthe troops, and with his son Hannibal, then nine years old, crossing\r\nby the Pillars of Hercules, set about recovering the Carthaginian\r\npossessions in Iberia. He spent nine years in Iberia, and after\r\nreducing many Iberian tribes by war or diplomacy to obedience to\r\nCarthage he died in a manner worthy of his great achievements; for he\r\nlost his life in a battle against the most warlike and powerful tribes,\r\nin which he showed a conspicuous and even reckless personal gallantry.\r\nThe Carthaginians appointed his son-in-law Hasdrubal to succeed him,\r\nwho was at the time in command of the fleet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illyricum.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ It was at this same period that the Romans for the first time\r\ncrossed to Illyricum and that part of Europe with an army. The history\r\nof this expedition must not be treated as immaterial; but must be\r\ncarefully studied by those who wish to understand clearly the story I\r\nhave undertaken to tell, and to trace the progress and consolidation of\r\nthe Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 233-232.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Medion in Acarnania.]\r\n\r\nAgron, king of the Illyrians, was the son of Pleuratus, and possessed\r\nthe most powerful force, both by land and sea, of any of the kings who\r\nhad reigned in Illyria before him. By a bribe received from Demetrius\r\nhe was induced to promise help to the Medionians, who were at that\r\ntime being besieged by the Aetolians, who, being unable to persuade\r\nthe Medionians to join their league, had determined to reduce the city\r\nby force. They accordingly levied their full army, pitched their camp\r\nunder the walls of the city, and kept up a continuous blockade, using\r\nevery means to force their way in, and every kind of siege-machine. But\r\nwhen the time of the annual election of their Strategus drew near, the\r\nbesieged being now in great distress, and seeming likely every day to\r\nsurrender, the existing Strategus made an appeal to the Aetolians. He\r\nargued that as he had had during his term of office all the suffering\r\nand the danger, it was but fair that when they got possession of the\r\ntown he should have the apportioning of the spoil, and the privilege\r\nof inscribing his name on such arms as should be preserved for\r\ndedication. This was resisted by some, and especially by those who were\r\ncandidates for the office, who urged upon the Assembly not to prejudge\r\nthis matter, but to leave it open for fortune to determine who was\r\nto be invested with this honour; and, finally, the Aetolians decided\r\nthat whoever was general when the city was taken should share the\r\napportioning of the spoils, and the honour of inscribing the arms, with\r\nhis predecessor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Illyrians relieve Medion.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ The decision was come to on the day before the election of a\r\nnew Strategus, and the transference of the command had, according\r\nto the Aetolian custom, to take place. But on that very night a\r\nhundred galleys with five thousand Illyrians on board, sailed up to\r\nland near Medion. Having dropped anchor at daybreak, they effected\r\na disembarkation with secrecy and despatch; they then formed in the\r\norder customary in their country, and advanced in their several\r\ncompanies against the Aetolian lines. These last were overwhelmed\r\nwith astonishment at the unexpected nature and boldness of the move;\r\nbut they had long been inspired with overweening self-confidence, and\r\nhaving full reliance in their own forces were far from being dismayed.\r\nThey drew up the greater part of their hoplites and cavalry in front of\r\ntheir lines on the level ground, and with a portion of their cavalry\r\nand their light infantry they hastened to occupy some rising ground in\r\nfront of their camp, which nature had made easily defensible. A single\r\ncharge, however, of the Illyrians, whose numbers and close order gave\r\nthem irresistible weight, served to dislodge the light-armed troops,\r\nand forced the cavalry who were on the ground with them to retire\r\nto the hoplites. But the Illyrians, being on the higher ground, and\r\ncharging down from it upon the Aetolian troops formed up on the plain,\r\nrouted them without difficulty; the Medionians at the same time making\r\na diversion in their favour by sallying out of the town and charging\r\nthe Aetolians. Thus, after killing a great number, and taking a still\r\ngreater number prisoners, and becoming masters also of their arms and\r\nbaggage, the Illyrians, having carried out the orders of their king,\r\nconveyed their baggage and the rest of the booty to their boats, and\r\nimmediately set sail for their own country.\r\n\r\n+4.+ This was a most unexpected relief to the Medionians. They met in\r\npublic assembly and deliberated on the whole business, and especially\r\nas to the inscribing the arms reserved for dedication. They decided,\r\nin mockery of the Aetolian decree, that the inscription should contain\r\nthe name of the Aetolian commander on the day of battle, and of the\r\ncandidates for succession to his office. And indeed Fortune seems,\r\nin what happened to them, to have designed a display of her power to\r\nthe rest of mankind. The very thing which these men were in momentary\r\nexpectation of undergoing at the hands of their enemies, she put it in\r\ntheir power to inflict upon those enemies, and all within a very brief\r\ninterval. The unexpected disaster of the Aetolians, too, may teach all\r\nthe world not to calculate on the future as though it were the actually\r\nexistent, and not to reckon securely on what may still turn out quite\r\notherwise, but to allow a certain margin to the unexpected. And as this\r\nis true everywhere and to every man, so is it especially true in war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Agron, who is succeeded by his wife Teuta, B.C.\r\n231.]\r\n\r\nWhen his galleys returned, and he heard from his officers the events\r\nof the expedition, King Agron was so beside himself with joy at the\r\nidea of having conquered the Aetolians, whose confidence in their\r\nown prowess had been extreme, that, giving himself over to excessive\r\ndrinking and other similar indulgences, he was attacked by a pleurisy\r\nof which in a few days he died. His wife Teuta succeeded him on the\r\nthrone; and managed the various details of administration by means of\r\nfriends whom she could trust. But her woman’s head had been turned by\r\nthe success just related, and she fixed her gaze upon that, and had no\r\neyes for anything going on outside the country. Her first measure was\r\nto grant letters of marque to privateers, authorising them to plunder\r\nall whom they fell in with; and she next collected a fleet and military\r\nforce as large as the former one, and despatched them with general\r\ninstructions to the leaders to regard every land as belonging to an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teuta’s piratical fleet, B.C. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Takes Phoenice in Epirus.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ Their first attack was to be upon the coast of Elis and Messenia,\r\nwhich had been from time immemorial the scene of the raids of the\r\nIllyrians. For owing to the length of their seaboard, and to the fact\r\nthat their most powerful cities were inland, troops raised to resist\r\nthem had a great way to go, and were long in coming to the spot where\r\nthe Illyrian pirates landed; who accordingly overran those districts,\r\nand swept them clean without having anything to fear. However, when\r\nthis fleet was off Phoenice in Epirus they landed to get supplies.\r\nThere they fell in with some Gauls, who to the number of eight hundred\r\nwere stationed at Phoenice, being in the pay of the Epirotes; and\r\ncontracted with them to betray the town into their hands. Having made\r\nthis bargain, they disembarked and took the town and everything in\r\nit at the first blow, the Gauls within the walls acting in collusion\r\nwith them. When this news was known, the Epirotes raised a general\r\nlevy and came in haste to the rescue. Arriving in the neighbourhood\r\nof Phoenice, they pitched their camp so as to have the river which\r\nflows past Phoenice between them and the enemy, tearing up the planks\r\nof the bridge over it for security. But news being brought them that\r\nScerdilaidas with five thousand Illyrians was marching overland by\r\nway of the pass near Antigoneia, they detached some of their forces\r\nto guard that town; while the main body gave themselves over to an\r\nunrestrained indulgence in all the luxuries which the country could\r\nsupply; and among other signs of demoralisation they neglected the\r\nnecessary precaution of posting sentries and night pickets. The\r\ndivision of their forces, as well as the careless conduct of the\r\nremainder, did not escape the observation of the Illyrians; who,\r\nsallying out at night, and replacing the planks on the bridge, crossed\r\nthe river safely, and having secured a strong position, remained there\r\nquietly for the rest of the night. At daybreak both armies drew up\r\ntheir forces in front of the town and engaged. In this battle the\r\nEpirotes were decidedly worsted: a large number of them fell, still\r\nmore were taken prisoners, and the rest fled in the direction of the\r\ncountry of the Atintanes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolian and Achaean leagues send a force to the relief\r\nof the Epirotes. A truce is made. The Illyrians depart.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ Having met with this reverse, and having lost all the hopes which\r\nthey had cherished, the Epirotes turned to the despatch of ambassadors\r\nto the Aetolians and Achaeans, earnestly begging for their assistance.\r\nMoved by pity for their misfortunes, these nations consented; and\r\nan army of relief sent out by them arrived at Helicranum. Meanwhile\r\nthe Illyrians who had occupied Phoenice, having effected a junction\r\nwith Scerdilaidas, advanced with him to this place, and, taking up a\r\nposition opposite to this army of relief, wished at first to give it\r\nbattle. But they were embarrassed by the unfavourable nature of the\r\nground; and just then a despatch was received from Teuta, ordering\r\ntheir instant return, because certain Illyrians had revolted to the\r\nDardani. Accordingly, after merely stopping to plunder Epirus, they\r\nmade a truce with the inhabitants, by which they undertook to deliver\r\nup all freemen, and the city of Phoenice, for a fixed ransom. They\r\nthen took the slaves they had captured and the rest of their booty to\r\ntheir galleys, and some of them sailed away; while those who were with\r\nScerdilaidas retired by land through the pass at Antigoneia, after\r\ninspiring no small or ordinary terror in the minds of the Greeks who\r\nlived along the coast. For seeing the most securely placed and powerful\r\ncity of Epirus thus unexpectedly reduced to slavery, they one and all\r\nbegan henceforth to feel anxious, not merely as in former times for\r\ntheir property in the open country, but for the safety of their own\r\npersons and cities.\r\n\r\nThe Epirotes were thus unexpectedly preserved: but so far from trying\r\nto retaliate on those who had wronged them, or expressing gratitude\r\nto those who had come to their relief, they sent ambassadors in\r\nconjunction with the Acarnanians to Queen Teuta, and made a treaty with\r\nthe Illyrians, in virtue of which they engaged henceforth to co-operate\r\nwith them and against the Achaean and Aetolian leagues. All which\r\nproceedings showed conclusively the levity of their conduct towards men\r\nwho had stood their friends, as well as an originally short-sighted\r\npolicy in regard to their own interests.\r\n\r\n+7.+ That men, in the infirmity of human nature, should fall into\r\nmisfortunes which defy calculation, is the fault not of the sufferers\r\nbut of Fortune, and of those who do the wrong; but that they should\r\nfrom mere levity, and with their eyes open, thrust themselves upon the\r\nmost serious disasters is without dispute the fault of the victims\r\nthemselves. Therefore it is that pity and sympathy and assistance await\r\nthose whose failure is due to Fortune: reproach and rebuke from all men\r\nof sense those who have only their own folly to thank for it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The career of a body of Gallic mercenaries,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: at Agrigentum,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: at Eryx.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disarmed by the Romans.]\r\n\r\nIt is the latter that the Epirotes now richly deserved at the hands\r\nof the Greeks. For in the first place, who in his senses, knowing\r\nthe common report as to the character of the Gauls, would not have\r\nhesitated to trust to them a city so rich, and offering so many\r\nopportunities for treason? And again, who would not have been on his\r\nguard against the bad character of this particular body of them?\r\nFor they had originally been driven from their native country by an\r\noutburst of popular indignation at an act of treachery done by them\r\nto their own kinsfolk and relations. Then having been received by\r\nthe Carthaginians, because of the exigencies of the war in which the\r\nlatter were engaged, and being drafted into Agrigentum to garrison\r\nit (being at the time more than three thousand strong), they seized\r\nthe opportunity of a dispute as to pay, arising between the soldiers\r\nand their generals, to plunder the city; and again being brought by\r\nthe Carthaginians into Eryx to perform the same duty, they first\r\nendeavoured to betray the city and those who were shut up in it with\r\nthem to the Romans who were besieging it; and when they failed in that\r\ntreason, they deserted in a body to the enemy: whose trust they also\r\nbetrayed by plundering the temple of Aphrodite in Eryx. Thoroughly\r\nconvinced, therefore, of their abominable character, as soon as they\r\nhad made peace with Carthage the Romans made it their first business to\r\ndisarm them, put them on board ship, and forbid them ever to enter any\r\npart of Italy. These were the men whom the Epirotes made the protectors\r\nof their democracy and the guardians of their laws! To such men as\r\nthese they entrusted their most wealthy city! How then can it be denied\r\nthat they were the cause of their own misfortunes?\r\n\r\nMy object, in commenting on the blind folly of the Epirotes, is to\r\npoint out that it is never wise to introduce a foreign garrison,\r\nespecially of barbarians, which is too strong to be controlled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illyrian pirates.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans interfere, B.C. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Teuta’s reception of the Roman legates.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Roman legate assassinated.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ To return to the Illyrians. From time immemorial they had\r\noppressed and pillaged vessels sailing from Italy: and now while\r\ntheir fleet was engaged at Phoenice a considerable number of them,\r\nseparating from the main body, committed acts of piracy on a number of\r\nItalian merchants: some they merely plundered, others they murdered,\r\nand a great many they carried off alive into captivity. Now, though\r\ncomplaints against the Illyrians had reached the Roman government in\r\ntimes past, they had always been neglected; but now when more and\r\nmore persons approached the Senate on this subject, they appointed\r\ntwo ambassadors, Gaius and Lucius Coruncanius, to go to Illyricum and\r\ninvestigate the matter. But on the arrival of her galleys from Epirus,\r\nthe enormous quantity and beauty of the spoils which they brought\r\nhome (for Phoenice was by far the wealthiest city in Epirus at that\r\ntime), so fired the imagination of Queen Teuta, that she was doubly\r\neager to carry on the predatory warfare on the coasts of Greece. At\r\nthe moment, however, she was stopped by the rebellion at home; but it\r\nhad not taken her long to put down the revolt in Illyria, and she was\r\nengaged in besieging Issa, the last town which held out, when just\r\nat that very time the Roman ambassadors arrived. A time was fixed\r\nfor their audience, and they proceeded to discuss the injuries which\r\ntheir citizens had sustained. Throughout the interview, however,\r\nTeuta listened with an insolent and disdainful air; and when they had\r\nfinished their speech, she replied that she would endeavour to take\r\ncare that no injury should be inflicted on Roman citizens by Illyrian\r\nofficials; but that it was not the custom for the sovereigns of Illyria\r\nto hinder private persons from taking booty at sea. Angered by these\r\nwords, the younger of the two ambassadors used a plainness of speech\r\nwhich, though thoroughly to the point, was rather ill-timed. “The\r\nRomans,” he said, “O Teuta, have a most excellent custom of using the\r\nState for the punishment of private wrongs and the redress of private\r\ngrievances: and we will endeavour, God willing, before long to compel\r\nyou to improve the relations between the sovereign and the subject\r\nin Illyria.” The queen received this plain speaking with womanish\r\npassion and unreasoning anger. So enraged was she at the speech that,\r\nin despite of the conventions universally observed among mankind, she\r\ndespatched some men after the ambassadors, as they were sailing home,\r\nto kill the one who had used this plainness. Upon this being reported\r\nat Rome the people were highly incensed at the queen’s violation of the\r\nlaw of nations, and at once set about preparations for war, enrolling\r\nlegions and collecting a fleet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 229. Another piratical fleet sent out by Teuta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their treacherous attack on Epidamnus, which is repulsed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack on Corcyra.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Corcyreans appeal to the Aetolian and Achaean leagues.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ When the season for sailing was come Teuta sent out a larger fleet\r\nof galleys than ever against the Greek shores, some of which sailed\r\nstraight to Corcyra; while a portion of them put into the harbour of\r\nEpidamnus on the pretext of taking in victual and water, but really to\r\nattack the town. The Epidamnians received them without suspicion and\r\nwithout taking any precautions. Entering the town therefore clothed\r\nmerely in their tunics, as though they were only come to fetch water,\r\nbut with swords concealed in the water vessels, they slew the guards\r\nstationed at the gates, and in a brief space were masters of the\r\ngate-tower. Being energetically supported by a reinforcement from the\r\nships, which came quickly up in accordance with a pre-arrangement, they\r\ngot possession of the greater part of the walls without difficulty. But\r\nthough the citizens were taken off their guard they made a determined\r\nand desperate resistance, and the Illyrians after maintaining their\r\nground for some time were eventually driven out of the town. So the\r\nEpidamnians on this occasion went near to lose their city by their\r\ncarelessness; but by the courage which they displayed they saved\r\nthemselves from actual damage while receiving a useful lesson for the\r\nfuture. The Illyrians who had engaged in this enterprise made haste to\r\nput to sea, and, rejoining the advanced squadron, put in at Corcyra:\r\nthere, to the terror of the inhabitants, they disembarked and set\r\nabout besieging the town. Dismayed and despairing of their safety, the\r\nCorcyreans, acting in conjunction with the people of Apollonia and\r\nEpidamnus, sent off envoys to the Achaean and Aetolian leagues, begging\r\nfor instant help, and entreating them not to allow of their being\r\ndeprived of their homes by the Illyrians. The petition was accepted,\r\nand the Achaean and Aetolian leagues combined to send aid. The ten\r\ndecked ships of war belonging to the Achaeans were manned, and having\r\nbeen fitted out in a few days, set sail for Corcyra in hopes of raising\r\nthe siege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of the Achaean ships.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corcyra submits.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ But the Illyrians obtained a reinforcement of seven decked ships\r\nfrom the Acarnanians, in virtue of their treaty with that people, and,\r\nputting to sea, engaged the Achaean fleet off the islands called Paxi.\r\nThe Acarnanian and Achaean ships fought without victory declaring for\r\neither, and without receiving any further damage than having some\r\nof their crew wounded. But the Illyrians lashed their galleys four\r\ntogether, and, caring nothing for any damage that might happen to\r\nthem, grappled with the enemy by throwing their galleys athwart their\r\nprows and encouraging them to charge; when the enemies’ prows struck\r\nthem, and got entangled by the lashed-together galleys getting hitched\r\non to their forward gear, the Illyrians leaped upon the decks of the\r\nAchaean ships and captured them by the superior number of their armed\r\nmen. In this way they took four triremes, and sunk one quinquereme with\r\nall hands, on board of which Margos of Caryneia was sailing, who had\r\nall his life served the Achaean league with complete integrity. The\r\nvessels engaged with the Acarnanians, seeing the triumphant success of\r\nthe Illyrians, and trusting to their own speed, hoisted their sails\r\nto the wind and effected their voyage home without further disaster.\r\nThe Illyrians, on the other hand, filled with self-confidence by their\r\nsuccess, continued their siege of the town in high spirits, and without\r\nputting themselves to any unnecessary trouble; while the Corcyreans,\r\nreduced to despair of safety by what had happened, after sustaining\r\nthe siege for a short time longer, made terms with the Illyrians,\r\nconsenting to receive a garrison, and with it Demetrius of Pharos.\r\nAfter this had been settled, the Illyrian admirals put to sea again;\r\nand, having arrived at Epidamnus, once more set about besieging that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 229. The Roman Consuls, with fleet and army, start to\r\npunish the Illyrians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demetrius of Pharos.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Corcyra becomes a “friend of Rome.”]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aulus Postumius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman settlement of Illyricum.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ In this same season one of the Consuls, Gnaeus Fulvius, started\r\nfrom Rome with two hundred ships, and the other Consul, Aulus\r\nPostumius, with the land forces. The plan of Gnaeus was to sail direct\r\nto Corcyra, because he supposed that he should find the result of the\r\nsiege still undecided. But when he found that he was too late for\r\nthat, he determined nevertheless to sail to the island because he\r\nwished to know the exact facts as to what had happened there, and to\r\ntest the sincerity of the overtures that had been made by Demetrius.\r\nFor Demetrius, being in disgrace with Teuta, and afraid of what she\r\nmight do to him, had been sending messages to Rome, offering to put\r\nthe city and everything else of which he was in charge into their\r\nhands. Delighted at the appearance of the Romans, the Corcyreans not\r\nonly surrendered the garrison to them, with the consent of Demetrius,\r\nbut committed themselves also unconditionally to the Roman protection;\r\nbelieving that this was their only security in the future against the\r\npiratical incursions of the Illyrians. So the Romans, having admitted\r\nthe Corcyreans into the number of the friends of Rome, sailed for\r\nApollonia, with Demetrius to act as their guide for the rest of the\r\ncampaign. At the same time the other Consul, Aulus Postumius, conveyed\r\nhis army across from Brundisium, consisting of twenty thousand infantry\r\nand about two thousand horse. This army, as well as the fleet under\r\nGnaeus Fulvius, being directed upon Apollonia, which at once put itself\r\nunder Roman protection, both forces were again put in motion on news\r\nbeing brought that Epidamnus was being besieged by the enemy. No sooner\r\ndid the Illyrians learn the approach of the Romans than they hurriedly\r\nbroke up the siege and fled. The Romans, taking the Epidamnians under\r\ntheir protection, advanced into the interior of Illyricum, subduing the\r\nArdiaei as they went. They were met on their march by envoys from many\r\ntribes: those of the Partheni offered an unconditional surrender, as\r\nalso did those of the Atintanes. Both were accepted: and the Roman army\r\nproceeded towards Issa, which was being besieged by Illyrian troops. On\r\ntheir arrival, they forced the enemy to raise the siege, and received\r\nthe Issaeans also under their protection. Besides, as the fleet coasted\r\nalong, they took certain Illyrian cities by storm; among which was\r\nNutria, where they lost not only a large number of soldiers, but some\r\nof the Military Tribunes also and the Quaestor. But they captured\r\ntwenty of the galleys which were conveying the plunder from the country.\r\n\r\nOf the Illyrian troops engaged in blockading Issa, those that belonged\r\nto Pharos were left unharmed, as a favour to Demetrius; while all\r\nthe rest scattered and fled to Arbo. Teuta herself, with a very few\r\nattendants, escaped to Rhizon, a small town very strongly fortified,\r\nand situated on the river of the same name. Having accomplished all\r\nthis, and having placed the greater part of Illyria under Demetrius,\r\nand invested him with a wide dominion, the Consuls retired to Epidamnus\r\nwith their fleet and army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 228. Teuta submits.]\r\n\r\n+12.+ Then Gnaeus Fulvius sailed back to Rome with the larger part of\r\nthe naval and military forces, while Postumius, staying behind and\r\ncollecting forty vessels and a legion from the cities in that district,\r\nwintered there to guard the Ardiaei and other tribes that had committed\r\nthemselves to the protection of Rome. Just before spring in the next\r\nyear, Teuta sent envoys to Rome and concluded a treaty; in virtue\r\nof which she consented to pay a fixed tribute, and to abandon all\r\nIllyricum, with the exception of some few districts: and what affected\r\nGreece more than anything, she agreed not to sail beyond Lissus with\r\nmore than two galleys, and those unarmed. When this arrangement had\r\nbeen concluded, Postumius sent legates to the Aetolian and Achaean\r\nleagues, who on their arrival first explained the reasons for the war\r\nand the Roman invasion; and then stated what had been accomplished in\r\nit, and read the treaty which had been made with the Illyrians. The\r\nenvoys then returned to Corcyra after receiving the thanks of both\r\nleagues: for they had freed Greece by this treaty from a very serious\r\ncause for alarm, the fact being that the Illyrians were not the enemies\r\nof this or that people, but the common enemies of all alike.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances of the first armed interference of the\r\nRomans in Illyricum and that part of Europe, and their first diplomatic\r\nrelations with Greece; and such too were the motives which suggested\r\nthem. But having thus begun, the Romans immediately afterwards sent\r\nenvoys to Corinth and Athens. And it was then that the Corinthians\r\nfirst admitted Romans to take part in the Isthmian games.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hasdrubal in Spain. The founding of New Carthage, B.C. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dread of the Gauls.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaty with Hasdrubal.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ We must now return to Hasdrubal in Iberia. He had during this\r\nperiod been conducting his command with ability and success, and\r\nhad not only given in general a great impulse to the Carthaginian\r\ninterests there, but in particular had greatly strengthened them by the\r\nfortification of the town, variously called Carthage, and New Town,\r\nthe situation of which was exceedingly convenient for operations in\r\nLibya as well as in Iberia. I shall take a more suitable opportunity\r\nof speaking of the site of this town, and pointing out the advantages\r\noffered by it to both countries: I must at present speak of the\r\nimpression made by Hasdrubal’s policy at Rome. Seeing him strengthening\r\nthe Carthaginian influence in Spain, and rendering it continually more\r\nformidable, the Romans were anxious to interfere in the politics of\r\nthat country. They discovered, as they thought, that they had allowed\r\ntheir suspicions to be lulled to sleep, and had meanwhile given the\r\nCarthaginians the opportunity of consolidating their power. They did\r\nnot venture, however, at the moment to impose conditions or make war\r\non them, because they were in almost daily dread of an attack from\r\nthe Celts. They determined therefore to mollify Hasdrubal by gentle\r\nmeasures, and so to leave themselves free to attack the Celts first\r\nand try conclusions with them: for they were convinced that, with such\r\nenemies on their flank, they would not only be unable to keep their\r\nhold over the rest of Italy, but even to reckon on safety in their own\r\ncity. Accordingly, while sending envoys to Hasdrubal, and making a\r\ntreaty with him by which the Carthaginians, without saying anything of\r\nthe rest of Iberia, engaged not to cross the Iber in arms, they pushed\r\non the war with the Celts in Italy.\r\n\r\n+14.+ This war itself I shall treat only summarily, to avoid breaking\r\nthe thread of my history; but I must go back somewhat in point of time,\r\nand refer to the period at which these tribes originally occupied their\r\ndistricts in Italy. For the story I think is worth knowing for its own\r\nsake, and must absolutely be kept in mind, if we wish to understand\r\nwhat tribes and districts they were on which Hannibal relied to assist\r\nhim in his bold design of destroying the Roman dominion. I will first\r\ndescribe the country in which they live, its nature, and its relation\r\nto the rest of Italy; for if we clearly understand its peculiarities,\r\ngeographical and natural, we shall be better able to grasp the salient\r\npoints in the history of the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Geography of Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Col di Tenda.]\r\n\r\nItaly, taken as a whole, is a triangle, of which the eastern side is\r\nbounded by the Ionian Sea and the Adriatic Gulf, its southern and\r\nwestern sides by the Sicilian and Tyrrhenian seas; these two sides\r\nconverge to form the apex of the triangle, which is represented by the\r\nsouthern promontory of Italy called Cocinthus, and which separates the\r\nIonian from the Sicilian Sea.[146] The third side, or base of this\r\ntriangle, is on the north, and is formed by the chain of the Alps\r\nstretching right across the country, beginning at Marseilles and the\r\ncoast of the Sardinian Sea, and with no break in its continuity until\r\nwithin a short distance of the head of the Adriatic. To the south of\r\nthis range, which I said we must regard as the base of the triangle,\r\nare the most northerly plains of Italy, the largest and most fertile\r\nof any with which I am acquainted in all Europe. This is the district\r\nwith which we are at present concerned. Taken as a whole, it too forms\r\na triangle, the apex of which is the point where the Apennines and Alps\r\nconverge, above Marseilles, and not far from the coast of the Sardinian\r\nSea. The northern side of this triangle is formed by the Alps,\r\nextending for 2200 stades; the southern by the Apennines, extending\r\n3600; and the base is the seaboard of the Adriatic, from the town of\r\nSena to the head of the gulf, a distance of more than 2500 stades. The\r\ntotal length of the three sides will thus be nearly 10,000 stades.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gallia Cis-Alpina.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ The yield of corn in this district is so abundant that wheat\r\nis often sold at four obols a Sicilian medimnus, barley at two, or a\r\nmetretes of wine for an equal measure of barley. The quantity of panic\r\nand millet produced is extraordinary; and the amount of acorns grown\r\nin the oak forests scattered about the country may be gathered from\r\nthe fact that, though nowhere are more pigs slaughtered than in Italy,\r\nfor sacrifices as well as for family use, and for feeding the army,\r\nby far the most important supply is from these plains. The cheapness\r\nand abundance of all articles of food may also be clearly shown from\r\nthe fact that travellers in these parts, when stopping at inns, do not\r\nbargain for particular articles, but simply ask what the charge is per\r\nhead for board. And for the most part the innkeepers are content to\r\nsupply their guests with every necessary at a charge rarely exceeding\r\nhalf an as (that is, the fourth part of an obol)[147] a day each. Of\r\nthe numbers, stature, and personal beauty of the inhabitants, and still\r\nmore of their bravery in war, we shall be able to satisfy ourselves\r\nfrom the facts of their history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Alps.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Apennines.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Po.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 15th July.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ Such parts of both slopes of the Alps as are not too rocky or\r\ntoo precipitous are inhabited by different tribes; those on the north\r\ntowards the Rhone by the Gauls, called Transalpine; those towards\r\nthe Italian plains by the Taurisci and Agones and a number of other\r\nbarbarous tribes. The name Transalpine is not tribal, but local, from\r\nthe Latin proposition _trans_, “across.” The summits of the Alps,\r\nfrom their rugged character, and the great depth of eternal snow, are\r\nentirely uninhabited. Both slopes of the Apennines, towards the Tuscan\r\nSea and towards the plains, are inhabited by the Ligurians, from above\r\nMarseilles and the junction with the Alps to Pisae on the coast, the\r\nfirst city on the west of Etruria, and inland to Arretium. Next to them\r\ncome the Etruscans; and next on both slopes the Umbrians. The distance\r\nbetween the Apennines and the Adriatic averages about five hundred\r\nstades; and when it leaves the northern plains the chain verges to the\r\nright, and goes entirely through the middle of the rest of Italy, as\r\nfar as the Sicilian Sea. The remaining portion of this triangle, namely\r\nthe plain along the sea coast, extends as far as the town of Sena. The\r\nPadus, celebrated by the poets under the name of Eridanus, rises in\r\nthe Alps near the apex of the triangle, and flows down to the plains\r\nwith a southerly course; but after reaching the plains, it turns to the\r\neast, and flowing through them discharges itself by two mouths into\r\nthe Adriatic. The larger part of the plain is thus cut off by it, and\r\nlies between this river and the Alps to the head of the Adriatic. In\r\nbody of water it is second to no river in Italy, because the mountain\r\nstreams, descending from the Alps and Apennines to the plain, one and\r\nall flow into it on both sides; and its stream is at its height and\r\nbeauty about the time of the rising of the Dog Star, because it is then\r\nswollen by the melting snows on those mountains. It is navigable for\r\nnearly two thousand stades up stream, the ships entering by the mouth\r\ncalled Olana; for though it is a single main stream to begin with, it\r\nbranches off into two at the place called Trigoboli, of which streams\r\nthe northern is called the Padoa, the southern the Olana. At the mouth\r\nof the latter there is a harbour affording as safe anchorage as any\r\nin the Adriatic. The whole river is called by the country folk the\r\nBodencus. As to the other stories current in Greece about this river,—I\r\nmean Phaethon and his fall, and the tears of the poplars and the black\r\nclothes of the inhabitants along this stream, which they are said to\r\nwear at this day as mourning for Phaethon,—all such tragic incidents\r\nI omit for the present, as not being suitable to the kind of work I\r\nhave in hand; but I shall return to them at some other more fitting\r\nopportunity, particularly because Timaeus has shown a strange ignorance\r\nof this district.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their character.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gauls expel Etruscans from the valley of the Po.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ To continue my description. These plains were anciently inhabited\r\nby Etruscans,[148] at the same period as what are called the Phlegraean\r\nplains round Capua and Nola; which latter, however, have enjoyed the\r\nhighest reputation, because they lay in a great many people’s way and\r\nso got known. In speaking then of the history of the Etruscan Empire,\r\nwe should not refer to the district occupied by them at the present\r\ntime, but to these northern plains, and to what they did when they\r\ninhabited them. Their chief intercourse was with the Celts, because\r\nthey occupied the adjoining districts; who, envying the beauty of their\r\nlands, seized some slight pretext to gather a great host and expel\r\nthe Etruscans from the valley of the Padus, which they at once took\r\npossession of themselves. First, the country near the source of the\r\nPadus was occupied by the Laevi and Lebecii; after them the Insubres\r\nsettled in the country, the largest tribe of all; and next them,\r\nalong the bank of the river, the Cenomani. But the district along the\r\nshore of the Adriatic was held by another very ancient tribe called\r\nVenĕti, in customs and dress nearly allied to Celts, but using quite a\r\ndifferent language, about whom the tragic poets have written a great\r\nmany wonderful tales. South of the Padus, in the Apennine district,\r\nfirst beginning from the west, the Ananes, and next them the Boii\r\nsettled. Next them, on the coast of the Adriatic, the Lingones; and\r\nsouth of these, still on the sea-coast, the Senones. These are the most\r\nimportant tribes that took possession of this part of the country.\r\nThey lived in open villages, and without any permanent buildings. As\r\nthey made their beds of straw or leaves, and fed on meat, and followed\r\nno pursuits but those of war and agriculture, they lived simple lives\r\nwithout being acquainted with any science or art whatever. Each man’s\r\nproperty, moreover, consisted in cattle and gold; as they were the only\r\nthings that could be easily carried with them, when they wandered from\r\nplace to place, and changed their dwelling as their fancy directed.\r\nThey made a great point, however, of friendship: for the man who\r\nhad the largest number of clients or companions in his wanderings,\r\nwas looked upon as the most formidable and powerful member of the\r\ntribe.[149]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Allia, 18th July, B.C. 390.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Latin war, B.C. 349-340.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 360.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 348.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 334.]\r\n\r\n+18.+ In the early times of their settlement they did not merely\r\nsubdue the territory which they occupied, but rendered also many of\r\nthe neighbouring peoples subject to them, whom they overawed by their\r\naudacity. Some time afterwards they conquered the Romans in battle, and\r\npursuing the flying legions, in three days after the battle occupied\r\nRome itself with the exception of the Capitol. But a circumstance\r\nintervened which recalled them home, an invasion, that is to say, of\r\ntheir territory by the Venĕti. Accordingly they made terms with the\r\nRomans, handed back the city, and returned to their own land; and\r\nsubsequently were occupied with domestic wars. Some of the tribes,\r\nalso, who dwelt on the Alps, comparing their own barren districts with\r\nthe rich territory occupied by the others, were continually making\r\nraids upon them, and collecting their forces to attack them. This gave\r\nthe Romans time to recover their strength, and to come to terms with\r\nthe people of Latium. When, thirty years after the capture of the city,\r\nthe Celts came again as far as Alba, the Romans were taken by surprise;\r\nand having had no intelligence of the intended invasion, nor time to\r\ncollect the forces of the Socii, did not venture to give them battle.\r\nBut when another invasion in great force took place twelve years later,\r\nthey did get previous intelligence of it; and, having mustered their\r\nallies, sallied forth to meet them with great spirit, being eager to\r\nengage them and fight a decisive battle. But the Gauls were dismayed\r\nat their approach; and, being besides weakened by internal feuds,\r\nretreated homewards as soon as night fell, with all the appearance of\r\na regular flight. After this alarm they kept quiet for thirteen years;\r\nat the end of which period, seeing that the power of the Romans was\r\ngrowing formidable, they made a peace and a definite treaty with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 299.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 297.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 283.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sena Gallica.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ They abided by this treaty for thirty years: but at that time,\r\nalarmed by a threatening movement on the part of the Transalpine\r\ntribes, and fearing that a dangerous war was imminent, they diverted\r\nthe attack of the invading horde from themselves by presents and\r\nappeals to their ties of kindred, but incited them to attack the\r\nRomans, joining in the expedition themselves. They directed their march\r\nthrough Etruria, and were joined by the Etruscans; and the combined\r\narmies, after taking a great quantity of booty, got safely back from\r\nthe Roman territory. But when they got home, they quarrelled about the\r\ndivision of the spoil, and in the end destroyed most of it, as well as\r\nthe flower of their own force. This is the way of the Gauls when they\r\nhave appropriated their neighbours’ property; and it mostly arises from\r\nbrutal drunkenness, and intemperate feeding. In the fourth year after\r\nthis, the Samnites and Gauls made a league, gave the Romans battle in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Camerium, and slew a large number. Incensed at\r\nthis defeat, the Romans marched out a few days afterwards, and with\r\ntwo Consular armies engaged the enemy in the territory of Sentinum;\r\nand, having killed the greater number of them, forced the survivors\r\nto retreat in hot haste each to his own land. Again, after another\r\ninterval of ten years, the Gauls besieged Arretium with a great army,\r\nand the Romans went to the assistance of the town, and were beaten in\r\nan engagement under its walls. The Praetor Lucius[150] having fallen in\r\nthis battle, Manius Curius was appointed in his place. The ambassadors,\r\nsent by him to the Gauls to treat for the prisoners, were treacherously\r\nmurdered by them. At this the Romans, in high wrath, sent an expedition\r\nagainst them, which was met by the tribe called the Senones. In a\r\npitched battle the army of the Senones were cut to pieces, and the rest\r\nof the tribe expelled from the country; into which the Romans sent\r\nthe first colony which they ever planted in Gaul—namely, the town of\r\nSena, so called from the tribe of Gauls which formerly occupied it.\r\nThis is the town which I mentioned before as lying on the coast at the\r\nextremity of the plains of the Padus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 282.]\r\n\r\n+20.+ Seeing the expulsion of the Senones, and fearing the same fate\r\nfor themselves, the Boii made a general levy, summoned the Etruscans\r\nto join them, and set out to war. They mustered their forces near\r\nthe lacus Vadimonis, and there gave the Romans battle; in which the\r\nEtruscans indeed suffered a loss of more than half their men, while\r\nscarcely any of the Boii escaped. But yet in the very next year the\r\nsame two nations joined forces once more; and arming even those of them\r\nwho had only just reached manhood, gave the Romans battle again; and it\r\nwas not until they had been utterly defeated in this engagement that\r\nthey humbled themselves so far as to send ambassadors to Rome and make\r\na treaty.[151]\r\n\r\nThese events took place in the third year before Pyrrhus crossed into\r\nItaly, and in the fifth before the destruction of the Gauls at Delphi.\r\nFor at this period fortune seems to have plagued the Gauls with a kind\r\nof epidemic of war. But the Romans gained two most important advantages\r\nfrom these events. First, their constant defeats at the hands of the\r\nGauls had inured them to the worst that could befall them; and so, when\r\nthey had to fight with Pyrrhus, they came to the contest like trained\r\nand experienced gladiators. And in the second place, they had crushed\r\nthe insolence of the Gauls just in time to allow them to give an\r\nundivided attention, first to the war with Pyrrhus for the possession\r\nof Italy, and then to the war with Carthage for the supremacy in Sicily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 236.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 232.]\r\n\r\n+21.+ After these defeats the Gauls maintained an unbroken peace with\r\nRome for forty-five years. But when the generation which had witnessed\r\nthe actual struggle had passed away, and a younger generation of men\r\nhad taken their places, filled with unreflecting hardihood, and who\r\nhad neither experienced nor seen any suffering or reverse, they began,\r\nas was natural, to disturb the settlement; and on the one hand to let\r\ntrifling causes exasperate them against Rome, and on the other to\r\ninvite the Alpine Gauls to join the fray. At first these intrigues were\r\ncarried on by their chiefs without the knowledge of the tribesmen;\r\nand accordingly, when an armed host of Transalpine Gauls arrived at\r\nAriminum, the Boii were suspicious; and forming a conspiracy against\r\ntheir own leaders, as well as against the new-comers, they put their\r\nown two kings Atis and Galatus to death, and cut each other to pieces\r\nin a pitched battle. Just then the Romans, alarmed at the threatened\r\ninvasion, had despatched an army; but learning that the Gauls had\r\ncommitted this act of self-destruction, it returned home again. In\r\nthe fifth year after this alarm, in the Consulship of Marcus Aemilius\r\nLepidus, the Romans divided among their citizens the territory of\r\nPicenum, from which they had ejected the Senones when they conquered\r\nthem: a democratic measure introduced by Gaius Flaminius, and a\r\npolicy which we must pronounce to have been the first step in the\r\ndemoralisation of the people, as well as the cause of the next Gallic\r\nwar. For many of the Gauls, and especially the Boii whose lands were\r\ncoterminous with the Roman territory, entered upon that war from\r\nthe conviction that the object of Rome in her wars with them was no\r\nlonger supremacy and empire over them, but their total expulsion and\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 231.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ Accordingly the two most extensive tribes, the Insubres and\r\nBoii, joined in the despatch of messengers to the tribes living about\r\nthe Alps and on the Rhone, who from a word which means “serving for\r\nhire,” are called Gaesatae. To their kings Concolitanus and Aneroetes\r\nthey offered a large sum of gold on the spot; and, for the future,\r\npointed out to them the greatness of the wealth of Rome, and all the\r\nriches of which they would become possessed, if they took it. In\r\nthese attempts to inflame their cupidity and induce them to join the\r\nexpedition against Rome they easily succeeded. For they added to the\r\nabove arguments pledges of their own alliance; and reminded them of the\r\ncampaign of their own ancestors in which they had seized Rome itself,\r\nand had been masters of all it contained, as well as the city itself,\r\nfor seven months; and had at last evacuated it of their own free will,\r\nand restored it by an act of free grace, returning unconquered and\r\nscatheless with the booty to their own land. These arguments made the\r\nleaders so eager for the expedition, that there never at any other time\r\ncame from that part of Gaul a larger host, or one consisting of more\r\nnotable warriors. Meanwhile, the Romans, informed of what was coming,\r\npartly by report and partly by conjecture, were in such a state of\r\nconstant alarm and excitement, that they hurriedly enrolled legions,\r\ncollected supplies, and sent out their forces to the frontier, as\r\nthough the enemy were already in their territory, before the Gauls had\r\nstirred from their own lands.\r\n\r\nIt was this movement of the Gauls that, more than anything else, helped\r\nthe Carthaginians to consolidate their power in Iberia. For the Romans,\r\nas I have said, looked upon the Celtic question as the more pressing\r\none of the two, as being so near home; and were forced to wink at what\r\nwas going on in Iberia, in their anxiety to settle it satisfactorily\r\nfirst. Having, therefore, put their relations with the Carthaginians on\r\na safe footing by the treaty with Hasdrubal, which I spoke of a short\r\ntime back,[152] they gave an undivided attention to the Celtic war,\r\nconvinced that their interest demanded that a decisive battle should be\r\nfought with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B. C. 225. Coss. L. Aemilius Papus. C. Atilius Regulus.]\r\n\r\n+23.+ The Gaesatae, then, having collected their forces, crossed the\r\nAlps and descended into the valley of the Padus with a formidable army,\r\n\r\nfurnished with a variety of armour, in the eighth year after the\r\ndistribution of the lands of Picenum. The Insubres and Boii remained\r\nloyal to the agreement they had made with them: but the Venĕti and\r\nCenomani being induced by embassies from Rome to take the Roman\r\nside, the Celtic kings were obliged to leave a portion of their\r\nforces behind, to guard against an invasion of their territory by\r\nthose tribes. They themselves, with their main army, consisting of\r\none hundred and fifty thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse and\r\nchariots, struck camp and started on their march, which was to be\r\nthrough Etruria, in high spirits. As soon as it was known at Rome that\r\nthe Celts had crossed the Alps, one of the Consuls, Lucius Aemilius\r\nPapus, was sent with an army to Ariminum to guard against the passage\r\nof the enemy, and one of the Praetors into Etruria: for the other\r\nConsul, Gaius Atilius Regulus, happened to be in Sardinia with his\r\nlegions. There was universal terror in Rome, for the danger threatening\r\nthem was believed to be great and formidable. And naturally so: for\r\nthe old fear of the Gauls had never been eradicated from their minds.\r\nNo one thought of anything else: they were incessantly occupied in\r\nmustering the legions, or enrolling new ones, and in ordering up such\r\nof the allies as were ready for service. The proper magistrates were\r\nordered to give in lists of all citizens of military age; that it might\r\nat once be known to what the total of the available forces amounted.\r\nAnd such stores of corn, and darts, and other military equipments were\r\ncollected as no one could remember on any former occasion. From every\r\nside assistance was eagerly rendered; for the inhabitants of Italy, in\r\ntheir terror at the Gallic invasion, no longer thought of the matter\r\nas a question of alliance with Rome, or of the war as undertaken to\r\nsupport Roman supremacy, but each people regarded it as a danger\r\nmenacing themselves and their own city and territory. The response to\r\nthe Roman appeal therefore was prompt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman resources.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ But in order that we may learn from actual facts how great the\r\npower was which Hannibal subsequently ventured to attack, and what a\r\nmighty empire he faced when he succeeded in inflicting upon the Roman\r\npeople the most severe disasters, I must now state the amount of the\r\nforces they could at that time bring into the field. The two Consuls\r\nhad marched out with four legions, each consisting of five thousand\r\ntwo hundred infantry and three hundred cavalry. Besides this there\r\nwere with each Consul allies to the number of thirty thousand infantry\r\nand two thousand cavalry. Of Sabines and Etruscans too, there had\r\ncome to Rome, for that special occasion, four thousand horse and more\r\nthan fifty thousand foot. These were formed into an army and sent\r\nin advance into Etruria, under the command of one of the Praetors.\r\nMoreover, the Umbrians and Sarsinatae, hill tribes of the Apennine\r\ndistrict, were collected to the number of twenty thousand; and with\r\nthem were twenty thousand Venĕti and Cenomani. These were stationed\r\non the frontier of the Gallic territory, that they might divert the\r\nattention of the invaders, by making an incursion into the territory of\r\nthe Boii. These were the forces guarding the frontier. In Rome itself,\r\nready as a reserve in case of the accidents of war, there remained\r\ntwenty thousand foot and three thousand horse of citizens, and thirty\r\nthousand foot and two thousand horse of the allies. Lists of men for\r\nservice had also been returned, of Latins eighty thousand foot and five\r\nthousand horse; of Samnites seventy thousand foot and seven thousand\r\nhorse; of Iapygians and Messapians together fifty thousand foot and\r\nsixteen thousand horse; and of Lucanians thirty thousand foot and three\r\nthousand horse; of Marsi, and Marrucini, and Ferentani, and Vestini,\r\ntwenty thousand foot and four thousand horse. And besides these, there\r\nwere in reserve in Sicily and Tarentum two legions, each of which\r\nconsisted of about four thousand two hundred foot, and two hundred\r\nhorse. Of the Romans and Campanians the total of those put on the roll\r\nwas two hundred and fifty thousand foot and twenty-three thousand\r\nhorse; so that the grand total of the forces actually defending Rome\r\nwas over 150,000 foot, 6000 cavalry:[153] and of the men able to bear\r\narms, Romans and allies, over 700,000 foot and 70,000 horse; while\r\nHannibal, when he invaded Italy, had less than twenty thousand to put\r\nagainst this immense force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gauls enter Etruria.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Praetor’s army defeated at Clusium.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ There will be another opportunity of treating the subject\r\nin greater detail; for the present I must return to the Celts.\r\nHaving entered Etruria, they began their march through the country,\r\ndevastating it as they chose, and without any opposition; and finally\r\ndirected their course against Rome itself. But when they were encamped\r\nunder the walls of Clusium, which is three days’ march from Rome, news\r\nwas brought them that the Roman forces, which were on duty in Etruria,\r\nwere following on their rear and were close upon them; upon which they\r\nturned back to meet them, eager to offer them battle. The two armies\r\ncame in sight of each other about sunset, and encamped for the night a\r\nshort distance apart. But when night fell, the Celts lit their watch\r\nfires; and leaving their cavalry on the ground, with instructions\r\nthat, as soon as daylight made them visible to the enemy, they should\r\nfollow by the same route, they made a secret retreat along the road to\r\nFaesulae, and took up their position there; that they might be joined\r\nby their own cavalry, and might disconcert the attack of the enemy.\r\nAccordingly, when at daybreak the Romans saw that the cavalry were\r\nalone, they believed that the Celts had fled, and hastened in pursuit\r\nof the retreating horse; but when they approached the spot where the\r\nenemy were stationed, the Celts suddenly left their position and fell\r\nupon them. The struggle was at first maintained with fury on both\r\nsides: but the courage and superior numbers of the Celts eventually\r\ngave them the victory. No less than six thousand Romans fell: while\r\nthe rest fled, most of whom made their way to a certain strongly\r\nfortified height, and there remained. The first impulse of the Celts\r\nwas to besiege them: but they were worn out by their previous night\r\nmarch, and all the suffering and fatigue of the day; leaving therefore\r\na detachment of cavalry to keep guard round the hill, they hastened to\r\nprocure rest and refreshment, resolving to besiege the fugitives next\r\nday unless they voluntarily surrendered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: On the arrival of Aemilius the Gauls retire.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ But meanwhile Lucius Aemilius, who had been stationed on the\r\ncoast of the Adriatic at Ariminum, having been informed that the Gauls\r\nhad entered Etruria and were approaching Rome, set off to the rescue;\r\nand after a rapid march appeared on the ground just at the critical\r\nmoment. He pitched his camp close to the enemy; and the fugitives on\r\nthe hill, seeing his watch fires, and understanding what had happened,\r\nquickly recovered their courage and sent some of their men unarmed\r\nto make their way through the forest and tell the Consul what had\r\nhappened. This news left the Consul as he thought no alternative but\r\nto fight. He therefore ordered the Tribunes to lead out the infantry\r\nat daybreak, while he, taking command of the cavalry, led the way\r\ntowards the hill. The Gallic chieftains too had seen his watch fires,\r\nand understood that the enemy was come; and at once held council of\r\nwar. The advice of King Aneroestes was, “that seeing the amount of\r\nbooty they had taken,—an incalculable quantity indeed of captives,\r\ncattle, and other spoil,—they had better not run the risk of another\r\ngeneral engagement, but return home in safety; and having disposed of\r\nthis booty, and freed themselves from its incumbrance, return, if they\r\nthought good, to make another determined attack upon Rome.” Having\r\nresolved to follow the advice of Aneroestes in the present juncture,\r\nthe chiefs broke up their night council, and before daybreak struck\r\ncamp, and marched through Etruria by the road which follows the coast\r\nof the Ligurian bay. While Lucius, having taken off the remnant of the\r\narmy from the hill, and combined it with his own forces, determined\r\nthat it would not be by any means advantageous to offer the enemy\r\nregular battle; but that it was better to dog their footsteps, watching\r\nfor favourable times and places at which to inflict damage upon them,\r\nor wrest some of their booty from their hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atilius landing at Pisa intercepts the march of the Gauls.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ Just at that time the Consul Gaius Atilius had crossed from\r\nSardinia, and having landed at Pisae was on his way to Rome; and\r\ntherefore he and the enemy were advancing to meet each other. When the\r\nCelts were at Telamon in Etruria, their advanced guard fell in with\r\nthat of Gaius, and the men being made prisoners informed the Consul in\r\nanswer to questions of what had taken place; and told him that both\r\nthe armies were in the neighbourhood: that of the Celts, namely, and\r\nthat of Lucius close upon their rear. Though somewhat disturbed at\r\nthe events which he thus learnt, Gaius regarded the situation as a\r\nhopeful one, when he considered that the Celts were on the road between\r\ntwo hostile armies. He therefore ordered the Tribunes to martial the\r\nlegions and to advance at the ordinary pace, and in line as far as the\r\nbreadth of the ground permitted; while he himself having surveyed a\r\npiece of rising ground which commanded the road, and under which the\r\nCelts must march, took his cavalry with him and hurried on to seize the\r\neminence, and so begin the battle in person; convinced that by these\r\nmeans he would get the principal credit of the action for himself.\r\nAt first the Celts not knowing anything about the presence of Gaius\r\nAtilius, but supposing from what was taking place, that the cavalry of\r\nAemilius had outmarched them in the night, and were seizing the points\r\nof vantage in the van of their route, immediately detached some cavalry\r\nand light armed infantry to dispute the possession of this eminence.\r\nBut having shortly afterwards learnt the truth about the presence of\r\nGaius from a prisoner who was brought in, they hurriedly got their\r\ninfantry into position, and drew them up so as to face two opposite\r\nways, some, that is, to the front and others to the rear. For they knew\r\nthat one army was following on their rear; and they expected from the\r\nintelligence which had reached them, and from what they saw actually\r\noccurring, that they would have to meet another on their front.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle of the horse. Atilius falls.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ Aemilius had heard of the landing of the legions at Pisae, but\r\nhad not expected them to be already so far on their road; but the\r\ncontest at the eminence proved to him that the two armies were quite\r\nclose. He accordingly despatched his horse at once to support the\r\nstruggle for the possession of the hill, while he marshalled his foot\r\nin their usual order, and advanced to attack the enemy who barred his\r\nway. The Celts had stationed the Alpine tribe of the Gaesatae to face\r\ntheir enemies on the rear, and behind them the Insubres; on their front\r\nthey had placed the Taurisci, and the Cispadane tribe of the Boii,\r\nfacing the legions of Gaius. Their waggons and chariots they placed on\r\nthe extremity of either wing, while the booty they massed upon one of\r\nthe hills that skirted the road, under the protection of a guard. The\r\narmy of the Celts was thus double-faced, and their mode of marshalling\r\ntheir forces was effective as well as calculated to inspire terror.\r\nThe Insubres and Boii were clothed in their breeches and light cloaks;\r\nbut the Gaesatae from vanity and bravado threw these garments away,\r\nand fell in in front of the army naked, with nothing but their arms;\r\nbelieving that, as the ground was in parts encumbered with brambles,\r\nwhich might possibly catch in their clothes and impede the use of their\r\nweapons, they would be more effective in this state. At first the\r\nonly actual fighting was that for the possession of the hill: and the\r\nnumbers of the cavalry, from all three armies, that had joined in the\r\nstruggle made it a conspicuous sight to all. In the midst of it the\r\nConsul Gaius fell, fighting with reckless bravery in the thick of the\r\nbattle, and his head was brought to the king of the Celts. The Roman\r\ncavalry, however, continued the struggle with spirit, and finally won\r\nthe position and overpowered their opponents. Then the foot also came\r\nto close quarters.\r\n\r\n+29.+ It was surely a peculiar and surprising battle to witness, and\r\nscarcely less so to hear described. A battle, to begin with, in which\r\nthree distinct armies were engaged, must have presented a strange\r\nand unusual appearance, and must have been fought under strange and\r\nunusual conditions. Again, it must have seemed to a spectator open to\r\nquestion, whether the position of the Gauls were the most dangerous\r\nconceivable, from being between two attacking forces; or the most\r\nfavourable, as enabling them to meet both armies at once, while their\r\nown two divisions afforded each other a mutual support: and, above\r\nall, as putting retreat out of the question, or any hope of safety\r\nexcept in victory. For this is the peculiar advantage of having an\r\narmy facing in two opposite directions. The Romans, on the other hand,\r\nwhile encouraged by having got their enemy between two of their own\r\narmies, were at the same time dismayed by the ornaments and clamour of\r\nthe Celtic host. For there were among them such innumerable horns and\r\ntrumpets, which were being blown simultaneously in all parts of their\r\narmy, and their cries were so loud and piercing, that the noise seemed\r\nnot to come merely from trumpets and human voices, but from the whole\r\ncountry-side at once. Not less terrifying was the appearance and rapid\r\nmovement of the naked warriors in the van, which indicated men in the\r\nprime of their strength and beauty: while all the warriors in the front\r\nranks were richly adorned with gold necklaces and bracelets. These\r\nsights certainly dismayed the Romans; still the hope they gave of a\r\nprofitable victory redoubled their eagerness for the battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The infantry engage.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ When the men who were armed with the _pilum_ advanced in front of\r\nthe legions, in accordance with the regular method of Roman warfare,\r\nand hurled their _pila_ in rapid and effective volleys, the inner ranks\r\nof the Celts found their jerkins and leather breeches of great service;\r\nbut to the naked men in the front ranks this unexpected mode of attack\r\ncaused great distress and discomfiture. For the Gallic shields not\r\nbeing big enough to cover the man, the larger the naked body the more\r\ncertainty was there of the _pilum_ hitting. And at last, not being\r\nable to retaliate, because the pilum-throwers were out of reach, and\r\ntheir weapons kept pouring in, some of them, in the extremity of their\r\ndistress and helplessness, threw themselves with desperate courage\r\nand reckless violence upon the enemy, and thus met a voluntary death;\r\nwhile others gave ground step by step towards their own friends, whom\r\nthey threw into confusion by this manifest acknowledgment of their\r\npanic. Thus the courage of the Gaesatae had broken down before the\r\npreliminary attack of the _pilum_. But when the throwers of it had\r\nrejoined their ranks, and the whole Roman line charged, the Insubres,\r\nBoii, and Taurisci received the attack, and maintained a desperate\r\nhand-to-hand fight. Though almost cut to pieces, they held their ground\r\nwith unabated courage, in spite of the fact that man for man, as well\r\nas collectively, they were inferior to the Romans in point of arms. The\r\nshields and swords of the latter were proved to be manifestly superior\r\nfor defence and attack, for the Gallic sword can only deliver a cut,\r\nbut cannot thrust. And when, besides, the Roman horse charged down\r\nfrom the high ground on their flank, and attacked them vigorously, the\r\ninfantry of the Celts were cut to pieces on the field, while their\r\nhorse turned and fled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aemilius returns home.]\r\n\r\n+31.+ Forty thousand of them were slain, and quite ten thousand taken\r\nprisoners, among whom was one of their kings, Concolitanus: the other\r\nking, Aneroestes, fled with a few followers; joined a few of his people\r\nin escaping to a place of security; and there put an end to his own\r\nlife and that of his friends. Lucius Aemilius, the surviving Consul,\r\ncollected the spoils of the slain and sent them to Rome, and restored\r\nthe property taken by the Gauls to its owners. Then taking command of\r\nthe legions, he marched along the frontier of Liguria, and made a raid\r\nupon the territory of the Boii; and having satisfied the desires of the\r\nlegions with plunder, returned with his forces to Rome in a few days’\r\nmarch. There he adorned the Capitol with the captured standards and\r\nnecklaces, which are gold chains worn by the Gauls round their necks;\r\nbut the rest of the spoils, and the captives, he converted to the\r\nbenefit of his own estate and to the adornment of his triumph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 224.]\r\n\r\nThus was the most formidable Celtic invasion repelled, which had been\r\nregarded by all Italians, and especially by the Romans, as a danger of\r\nthe utmost gravity. The victory inspired the Romans with a hope that\r\nthey might be able to entirely expel the Celts from the valley of the\r\nPadus: and accordingly the Consuls of the next year, Quintus Fulvius\r\nFlaccus and Titus Manlius Torquatus, were both sent out with their\r\nlegions, and military preparations on a large scale, against them. By\r\na rapid attack they terrified the Boii into making submission to Rome;\r\nbut the campaign had no other practical effect, because, during the\r\nrest of it, there was a season of excessive rains, and an outbreak of\r\npestilence in the army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 223.]\r\n\r\n+32.+ The Consuls of the next year, however, Publius Furius Philus and\r\nCaius Flaminius, once more invaded the Celtic lands, marching through\r\nthe territory of the Anamares, who live not far from Placentia.[154]\r\nHaving secured the friendship of this tribe, they crossed into the\r\ncountry of the Insubres, near the confluence of the Adua and Padus.\r\nThey suffered some annoyance from the enemy, as they were crossing\r\nthe river, and as they were pitching their camp; and after remaining\r\nfor a short time, they made terms with the Insubres and left their\r\ncountry. After a circuitous march of several days, they crossed the\r\nRiver Clusius, and came into the territory of the Cenomani. As these\r\npeople were allies of Rome, they reinforced the army with some of\r\ntheir men, which then descended once more from the Alpine regions\r\ninto the plains belonging to the Insubres, and began laying waste\r\ntheir land and plundering their houses. The Insubrian chiefs, seeing\r\nthat nothing could change the determination of the Romans to destroy\r\nthem, determined that they had better try their fortune by a great\r\nand decisive battle. They therefore mustered all their forces, took\r\ndown from the temple of Minerva the golden standards, which are called\r\n“the immovables,” and having made other necessary preparations, in\r\nhigh spirits and formidable array, encamped opposite to their enemies\r\nto the number of fifty thousand. Seeing themselves thus out-numbered,\r\nthe Romans at first determined to avail themselves of the forces\r\nof the allied Celtic tribes; but when they reflected on the fickle\r\ncharacter of the Gauls, and that they were about to fight with an\r\nenemy of the same race as these auxiliary troops, they hesitated to\r\nassociate such men with themselves, at a crisis of such danger, and\r\nin an action of such importance. However, they finally decided to do\r\nthis. They themselves stayed on the side of the river next the enemy:\r\nand sending the Celtic contingent to the other side, they pulled up the\r\nbridges; which at once precluded any fear of danger from them, and left\r\nthemselves no hope of safety except in victory; the impassable river\r\nbeing thus in their rear. These dispositions made, they were ready to\r\nengage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle with the Insubres.]\r\n\r\n+33.+ The Romans are thought to have shown uncommon skill in this\r\nbattle; the Tribunes instructing the troops how they were to conduct\r\nthemselves both collectively and individually. They had learned from\r\nformer engagements that Gallic tribes were always most formidable at\r\nthe first onslaught, before their courage was at all damped by a check;\r\nand that the swords with which they were furnished, as I have mentioned\r\nbefore, could only give one downward cut with any effect, but that\r\nafter this the edges got so turned and the blade so bent, that unless\r\nthey had time to straighten them with their foot against the ground,\r\nthey could not deliver a second blow. The Tribunes accordingly gave\r\nout the spears of the Triarii, who are the last of the three ranks, to\r\nthe first ranks, or Hastati: and ordering the men to use their swords\r\nonly, after their spears were done with, they charged the Celts full\r\nin front. When the Celts had rendered their swords useless by the\r\nfirst blows delivered on the spears, the Romans closed with them, and\r\nrendered them quite helpless, by preventing them from raising their\r\nhands to strike with their swords, which is their peculiar and only\r\nstroke, because their blade has no point. The Romans, on the contrary,\r\nhaving excellent points to their swords, used them not to cut but to\r\nthrust: and by thus repeatedly hitting the breasts and faces of the\r\nenemy, they eventually killed the greater number of them. And this\r\nwas due to the foresight of the Tribunes: for the Consul Flaminius is\r\nthought to have made a strategic mistake in his arrangements for this\r\nbattle. By drawing up his men along the very brink of the river, he\r\nrendered impossible a manœuvre characteristic of Roman tactics, because\r\nhe left the lines no room for their deliberate retrograde movements;\r\nfor if, in the course of the battle, the men had been forced ever so\r\nlittle from their ground, they would have been obliged by this blunder\r\nof their leader to throw themselves into the river. However, the valour\r\nof the soldiers secured them a brilliant victory, as I have said, and\r\nthey returned to Rome with abundance of booty of every kind, and of\r\ntrophies stripped from the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 222. Attack on the Insubres.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ Next year, upon embassies coming from the Celts, desiring peace\r\nand making unlimited offers of submission, the new Consuls, Marcus\r\nClaudius Marcellus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus, were urgent that\r\nno peace should be granted them. Thus frustrated, they determined to\r\ntry a last chance, and once more took active measures to hire thirty\r\nthousand Gaesatae,—the Gallic tribe which lives on the Rhone. Having\r\nobtained these, they held themselves in readiness, and waited for\r\nthe attack of their enemies. At the beginning of spring the Consuls\r\nassumed command of their forces, and marched them into the territory\r\nof the Insubres; and there encamped under the walls of the city of\r\nAcerrae, which lies between the Padus and the Alps, and laid siege to\r\nit. The Insubres, being unable to render any assistance, because all\r\nthe positions of vantage had been seized by the enemy first, and being\r\nyet very anxious to break up the siege of Acerrae, detached a portion\r\nof their forces to affect a diversion by crossing the Padus and laying\r\nsiege to Clastidium. Intelligence of this movement being brought to the\r\nConsuls, Marcus Claudius, taking with him his cavalry and some light\r\ninfantry, made a forced march to relieve the besieged inhabitants. When\r\nthe Celts heard of his approach, they raised the siege; and, marching\r\nout to meet him, offered him battle. At first they held their ground\r\nagainst a furious charge of cavalry which the Roman Consul launched at\r\nthem; but when they presently found themselves surrounded by the enemy\r\non their rear and flank, unable to maintain the fight any longer, they\r\nfled before the cavalry; and many of them were driven into the river,\r\nand were swept away by the stream, though the larger number were cut\r\ndown by their enemies. Acerrae also, richly stored with corn, fell into\r\nthe hands of the Romans: the Gauls having evacuated it, and retired\r\nto Mediolanum, which is the most commanding position in the territory\r\nof the Insubres. Gnaeus followed them closely, and suddenly appeared\r\nat Mediolanum. The Gauls at first did not stir; but upon his starting\r\non his return march to Acerrae, they sallied out, and having boldly\r\nattacked his rear, killed a good many men, and even drove a part of\r\nit into flight; until Gnaeus recalled some of his vanguard, and urged\r\nthem to stand and engage the enemy. The Roman soldiers obeyed orders,\r\nand offered a vigorous resistance to the attacking party. The Celts,\r\nencouraged by their success, held their ground for a certain time with\r\nsome gallantry, but before long turned and fled to the neighbouring\r\nmountains. Gnaeus followed them, wasting the country as he went,\r\nand took Mediolanum by assault. At this the chiefs of the Insubres,\r\ndespairing of safety, made a complete and absolute submission to Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 480.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 279.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ Such was the end of the Celtic war: which, for the desperate\r\ndetermination and boldness of the enemy, for the obstinacy of the\r\nbattles fought, and for the number of those who fell and of those\r\nwho were engaged, is second to none recorded in history, but which,\r\nregarded as a specimen of scientific strategy, is utterly contemptible.\r\nThe Gauls showed no power of planning or carrying out a campaign, and\r\nin everything they did were swayed by impulse rather than by sober\r\ncalculation. As I have seen these tribes, after a short struggle,\r\nentirely ejected from the valley of the Padus, with the exception of\r\nsome few localities lying close to the Alps, I thought I ought not\r\nto let their original attack upon Italy pass unrecorded, any more\r\nthan their subsequent attempts, or their final ejectment: for it is\r\nthe function of the historian to record and transmit to posterity\r\nsuch episodes in the drama of Fortune; that our posterity may not\r\nfrom ignorance of the past be unreasonably dismayed at the sudden\r\nand unexpected invasions of these barbarians, but may reflect how\r\nshort-lived and easily damped the spirit of this race is; and so may\r\nstand to their defence, and try every possible means before yielding an\r\ninch to them. I think, for instance, that those who have recorded for\r\nour information the invasion of Greece by the Persians, and of Delphi\r\nby the Gauls, have contributed materially to the struggles made for\r\nthe common freedom of Greece. For a superiority in supplies, arms, or\r\nnumbers, would scarcely deter any one from putting the last possible\r\nhope to the test, in a struggle for the integrity and the safety of\r\nhis city and its territory, if he had before his eyes the surprising\r\nresult of those expeditions; and remembered how many myriads of men,\r\nwhat daring confidence, and what immense armaments were baffled by the\r\nskill and ability of opponents, who conducted their measures under the\r\ndictates of reason and sober calculation. And as an invasion of Gauls\r\nhas been a source of alarm to Greece in our day, as well as in ancient\r\ntimes, I thought it worth while to give a summary sketch of their\r\ndoings from the earliest times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hasdrubal in Spain, B.C. 221. See chap. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Succession of Hannibal to the command in Spain. His\r\nhostility to Rome.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ Our narrative now returns to Hasdrubal, whom we left in command\r\nof the Carthaginian forces in Iberia. After eight years command in\r\nthat country, he was assassinated in his own house at night by a\r\ncertain Celt in revenge for some private wrong. Before his death he\r\nhad done much to strengthen the Carthaginian power in Iberia, not so\r\nmuch by military achievements, as by the friendly relations which\r\nhe maintained with the native princes. Now that he was dead, the\r\nCarthaginians invested Hannibal with the command in Iberia, in spite\r\nof his youth, because of the ability in the conduct of affairs, and\r\nthe daring spirit which he had displayed. He had no sooner assumed the\r\ncommand, than he nourished a fixed resolve to make war on Rome; nor was\r\nit long before he carried out this resolution. From that time forth\r\nthere were constant suspicions and causes of offence arising between\r\nthe Carthaginians and Romans. And no wonder: for the Carthaginians\r\nwere meditating revenge for their defeats in Sicily; and the Romans\r\nwere made distrustful from a knowledge of their designs. These things\r\nmade it clear to every one of correct judgment that before long a war\r\nbetween these two nations was inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social war, B.C. 220-217.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ At the same period the Achaean league and King Philip, with their\r\nallies, were entering upon the war with the Aetolian league, which is\r\ncalled the Social war. Now this was the point at which I proposed to\r\nbegin my general history; and as I have brought the account of the\r\naffairs of Sicily and Libya, and those which immediately followed, in\r\na continuous narrative, up to the date of the beginning of the Social\r\nand Second Punic, generally called the Hannibalic, wars, it will be\r\nproper to leave this branch of my subject for a while, and to take up\r\nthe history of events in Greece, that I may start upon my full and\r\ndetailed narrative, after bringing the prefatory sketch of the history\r\nof the several countries to the same point of time. For since I have\r\nnot undertaken, as previous writers have done, to write the history of\r\nparticular peoples, such as the Greeks or Persians, but the history\r\nof all known parts of the world at once, because there was something\r\nin the state of our own times which made such a plan peculiarly\r\nfeasible,—of which I shall speak more at length hereafter,—it will be\r\nproper, before entering on my main subject, to touch briefly on the\r\nstate of the most important of the recognised nations of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The progress of the Achaean league.]\r\n\r\nOf Asia and Egypt I need not speak before the time at which my history\r\ncommences. The previous history of these countries has been written\r\nby a number of historians already, and is known to all the world;\r\nnor in our days has any change specially remarkable or unprecedented\r\noccurred to them demanding a reference to their past. But in regard to\r\nthe Achaean league, and the royal family of Macedonia, it will be in\r\nharmony with my design to go somewhat farther back: for the latter has\r\nbecome entirely extinct; while the Achaeans, as I have stated before,\r\nhave in our time made extraordinary progress in material prosperity and\r\ninternal unity. For though many statesmen had tried in past times to\r\ninduce the Peloponnesians to join in a league for the common interests\r\nof all, and had always failed, because every one was working to secure\r\nhis own power rather than the freedom of the whole; yet in our day\r\nthis policy has made such progress, and been carried out with such\r\ncompleteness, that not only is there in the Peloponnese a community of\r\ninterests such as exists between allies or friends, but an absolute\r\nidentity of laws, weights, measures, and currency.[155] All the States\r\nhave the same magistrates, senate, and judges. Nor is there any\r\ndifference between the entire Peloponnese and a single city, except in\r\nthe fact that its inhabitants are not included within the same wall; in\r\nother respects, both as a whole and in their individual cities, there\r\nis a nearly absolute assimilation of institutions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the name as embracing all the Peloponnese.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ It will be useful to ascertain, to begin with, how it came to\r\npass that the name of the Achaeans became the universal one for all\r\nthe inhabitants of the Peloponnese. For the original bearers of this\r\nancestral name have no superiority over others, either in the size of\r\ntheir territory and cities, or in wealth, or in the prowess of their\r\nmen. For they are a long way off being superior to the Arcadians and\r\nLacedaemonians in number of inhabitants and extent of territory; nor\r\ncan these latter nations be said to yield the first place in warlike\r\ncourage to any Greek people whatever. Whence then comes it that these\r\nnations, with the rest of the inhabitants of the Peloponnese, have\r\nbeen content to adopt the constitution and the name of the Achaeans?\r\nTo speak of chance in such a matter would not be to offer any adequate\r\nsolution of the question, and would be a mere idle evasion. A cause\r\nmust be sought; for without a cause nothing, expected or unexpected,\r\ncan be accomplished. The cause then, in my opinion, was this. Nowhere\r\ncould be found a more unalloyed and deliberately established system of\r\nequality and absolute freedom, and, in a word, of democracy, than among\r\nthe Achaeans. This constitution found many of the Peloponnesians ready\r\nenough to adopt it of their own accord: many were brought to share in\r\nit by persuasion and argument: some, though acting under compulsion\r\nat first, were quickly brought to acquiesce in its benefits; for none\r\nof the original members had any special privilege reserved for them,\r\nbut equal rights were given to all comers: the object aimed at was\r\ntherefore quickly attained by the two most unfailing expedients of\r\nequality and fraternity. This then must be looked upon as the source\r\nand original cause of Peloponnesian unity and consequent prosperity.\r\n\r\nThat this was the original principle on which the Achaeans acted in\r\nforming their constitution might be demonstrated by many proofs; but\r\nfor the present purpose it will be sufficient to allege one or two in\r\nconfirmation of my assertion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 371.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 405-367.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ζεὺς ὁμάριος or ἀμάριος]\r\n\r\n+39.+ And first: When the burning of the Pythagorean clubs in Magna\r\nGrecia was followed by great constitutional disturbances, as was\r\nnatural on the sudden disappearance of the leading men in each state;\r\nand the Greek cities in that part of Italy became the scene of murder,\r\nrevolutionary warfare, and every kind of confusion; deputations\r\nwere sent from most parts of Greece to endeavour to bring about\r\nsome settlement of these disorders.[156] But the disturbed states\r\npreferred the intervention of the Achaeans above all others, and\r\nshowed the greatest confidence in them, in regard to the measures\r\nto be adopted for removing the evils that oppressed them. Nor was\r\nthis the only occasion on which they displayed this preference. For\r\nshortly afterwards there was a general movement among them to adopt\r\nthe model of the Achaean constitution. The first states to move in\r\nthe matter were Croton, Sybaris, and Caulonia, who began by erecting\r\na common temple to Zeus Homorios,[157] and a place in which to hold\r\ntheir meetings and common councils. They then adopted the laws and\r\ncustoms of the Achaeans, and determined to conduct their constitution\r\naccording to their principles; but finding themselves hampered by the\r\ntyranny of Dionysius of Syracuse, and also by the encroachment of the\r\nneighbouring barbarians, they were forced much against their will\r\nto abandon them. Again, later on, when the Lacedaemonians met with\r\ntheir unexpected reverse at Leuctra, and the Thebans as unexpectedly\r\nclaimed the hegemony in Greece, a feeling of uncertainty prevailed\r\nthroughout the country, and especially among the Lacedaemonians and\r\nThebans themselves, because the former refused to allow that they were\r\nbeaten, the latter felt hardly certain that they had conquered. On\r\nthis occasion, once more, the Achaeans were the people selected by the\r\ntwo parties, out of all Greece, to act as arbitrators on the points\r\nin dispute. And this could not have been from any special view of\r\ntheir power, for at that time they were perhaps the weakest state in\r\nGreece; it was rather from a conviction of their good faith and high\r\nprinciples, in regard to which there was but one opinion universally\r\nentertained. At that period of their history, however, they possessed\r\nonly the elements of success; success itself, and material increase,\r\nwere barred by the fact that they had not yet been able to produce a\r\nleader worthy of the occasion. Whenever any man had given indications\r\nof such ability, he was systematically thrust into the background and\r\nhampered, at one time by the Lacedaemonian government, and at another,\r\nstill more effectually, by that of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n+40.+ When at length, however, the country did obtain leaders of\r\nsufficient ability, it quickly manifested its intrinsic excellence by\r\nthe accomplishment of that most glorious achievement,—the union of the\r\nPeloponnese. The originator of this policy in the first instance was\r\nAratus of Sicyon; its active promotion and consummation was due to\r\nPhilopoemen of Megalopolis; while Lycortas and his party must be looked\r\nupon as the authors of the permanence which it enjoyed. The actual\r\nachievements of these several statesmen I shall narrate in their proper\r\nplaces: but while deferring a more detailed account of the other two, I\r\nthink it will be right to briefly record here, as well as in a future\r\nportion of my work, the political measures of Aratus, because he has\r\nleft a record of them himself in an admirably honest and lucid book of\r\ncommentaries.\r\n\r\nI think the easiest method for myself, and most intelligible to my\r\nreaders, will be to start from the period of the restoration of the\r\nAchaean league and federation, after its disintegration into separate\r\nstates by the Macedonian kings: from which time it has enjoyed an\r\nunbroken progress towards the state of completion which now exists, and\r\nof which I have already spoken at some length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 124th Olympiad, B.C. 284-280.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First Achaean league.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 371.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 323-284.]\r\n\r\n+41.+ The period I mean is the 124th Olympiad. In this occurred the\r\nfirst league of Patrae and Dyme, and the deaths of Ptolemy son of\r\nLagus, Lysimachus, Seleucus, Ptolemy Ceraunus. In the period before\r\nthis the state of Achaia was as follows. It was ruled by kings from\r\nthe time of Tisamenus, son of Orestes, who, being expelled from\r\nSparta on the return of the Heraclidae, formed a kingdom in Achaia.\r\nThe last of this royal line to maintain his power was Ogyges,\r\nwhose sons so alienated the people by their unconstitutional and\r\ntyrannical government, that a revolution took place and a democracy\r\nwas established. In the period subsequent to this, up to the time of\r\nthe establishment of the supreme authority of Alexander and Philip,\r\ntheir fortunes were subject to various fluctuations, but they always\r\nendeavoured to maintain intact in their league a democratical form of\r\ngovernment, as I have already stated. This league consisted of twelve\r\ncities, all of them still surviving, with the exception of Olenus, and\r\nHelice which was engulfed by the sea before the battle of Leuctra.\r\nThe other ten were Patrae, Dyme, Pharae, Tritaea, Leontium, Aegium,\r\nAegeira, Pellene, Bura, Caryneia. In the period immediately succeeding\r\nAlexander, and before the above-named 124th Olympiad, these cities,\r\nchiefly through the instrumentality of the Macedonian kings, became so\r\nestranged and ill-disposed to each other, and so divided and opposed\r\nin their interests, that some of them had to submit to the presence\r\nof foreign garrisons, sent first by Demetrius and Cassander, and\r\nafterwards by Antigonus Gonatas, while others even fell under the power\r\nof Tyrants; for no one set up more of such absolute rulers in the Greek\r\nstates than this last-named king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 284-280, Second Achaean league.]\r\n\r\nBut about the 124th Olympiad, as I have said, a change of sentiment\r\nprevailed among the Achaean cities, and they began again to form a\r\nleague. This was just at the time of Pyrrhus’s invasion of Italy. The\r\nfirst to take this step were the peoples of Dyme, Patrae, Tritaea, and\r\nPharae. And as they thus formed the nucleus of the league, we find no\r\ncolumn extant recording the compact between these cities. But about\r\nfive years afterwards the people of Aegium expelled their foreign\r\ngarrison and joined the league; next, the people of Bura put their\r\ntyrant to death and did the same; simultaneously, the state of Caryneia\r\nwas restored to the league. For Iseas, the then tyrant of Caryneia,\r\nwhen he saw the expulsion of the garrison from Aegium, and the death of\r\nthe despot in Bura at the hands of Margos and the Achaeans, and when he\r\nsaw that he was himself on the point of being attacked on all sides,\r\nvoluntarily laid down his office; and having obtained a guarantee for\r\nhis personal safety from the Achaeans, formally gave in the adhesion of\r\nhis city to the league.\r\n\r\n+42.+ My object in thus going back in point of time was, first, to show\r\nclearly at what epoch the Achaeans entered into the second league,\r\nwhich exists at this day, and which were the first members of the\r\noriginal league to do so; and, secondly, that the continuity of the\r\npolicy pursued by the Achaeans might rest, not on my word only, but on\r\nthe evidence of the actual facts. It was in virtue of this policy,—by\r\nholding out the bait of equality and freedom, and by invariably making\r\nwar upon and crushing those who on their own account, or with the\r\nsupport of the kings, enslaved any of the states within their borders,\r\nthat they finally accomplished the design which they had deliberately\r\nadopted, in some cases by their own unaided efforts, and in others\r\nby the help of their allies. For in fact whatever was effected in\r\nthis direction, by the help of these allies in after times, must be\r\nput down to the credit of the deliberately adopted policy of the\r\nAchaeans themselves. They acted indeed jointly with others in many\r\nhonourable undertakings, and in none more so than with the Romans:\r\nyet in no instance can they be said to have aimed at obtaining from\r\ntheir success any advantage for a particular state. In return for the\r\nzealous assistance rendered by them to their allies, they bargained for\r\nnothing but the freedom of each state and the union of the Peloponnese.\r\nBut this will be more clearly seen from the record of their actual\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victory of Lutatius off the insulae Aegates, B.C. 241.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 243-242.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 255-254. Margos.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 251-250. Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+43.+ For the first twenty-five years of the league between the cities\r\nI have mentioned, a secretary and two strategi for the whole union were\r\nelected by each city in turn. But after this period they determined\r\nto appoint one strategus only,[158] and put the entire management of\r\nthe affairs of the union in his hands. The first to obtain this honour\r\nwas Margos of Caryneia. In the fourth year after this man’s tenure\r\nof the office, Aratus of Sicyon caused his city to join the league,\r\nwhich, by his energy and courage, he had, when only twenty years of\r\nage, delivered from the yoke of its tyrant. In the eighth year again\r\nafter this, Aratus, being elected strategus for the second time, laid\r\na plot to seize the Acrocorinthus, then held by Antigonus; and by his\r\nsuccess freed the inhabitants of the Peloponnese from a source of\r\nserious alarm: and having thus liberated Corinth he caused it to join\r\nthe league. In his same term of office he got Megara into his hands,\r\nand caused it to join also. These events occurred in the year before\r\nthe decisive defeat of the Carthaginians, in consequence of which they\r\nevacuated Sicily and consented for the first time to pay tribute to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antigonus Gonatas, B.C. 283-239.]\r\n\r\nHaving made this remarkable progress in his design in so short a time,\r\nAratus continued thenceforth in the position of leader of the Achaean\r\nleague, and in the consistent direction of his whole policy to one\r\nsingle end; which was to expel Macedonians from the Peloponnese, to\r\ndepose the despots, and to establish in each state the common freedom\r\nwhich their ancestors had enjoyed before them. So long, therefore,\r\nas Antigonus Gonatas was alive, he maintained a continual opposition\r\nto his interference, as well as to the encroaching spirit of the\r\nAetolians, and in both cases with signal skill and success; although\r\ntheir presumption and contempt for justice had risen to such a pitch,\r\nthat they had actually made a formal compact with each other for the\r\ndisruption of the Achaeans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demetrius, B.C. 239-229.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ After the death of Antigonus, however, the Achaeans made terms\r\nwith the Aetolians, and joined them energetically in the war against\r\nDemetrius; and, in place of the feelings of estrangement and hostility,\r\nthere gradually grew up a sentiment of brotherhood and affection\r\nbetween the two peoples. Upon the death of Demetrius, after a reign of\r\nonly ten years, just about the time of the first invasion of Illyricum\r\nby the Romans, the Achaeans had a most excellent opportunity of\r\nestablishing the policy which they had all along maintained. For the\r\ndespots in the Peloponnese were in despair at the death of Demetrius.\r\nIt was the loss to them of their chief supporter and paymaster. And now\r\nAratus was for ever impressing upon them that they ought to abdicate,\r\nholding out rewards and honours for those of them who consented,\r\nand threatening those who refused with still greater vengeance from\r\nthe Achaeans. There was therefore a general movement among them to\r\nvoluntarily restore their several states to freedom and to join the\r\nleague. I ought however to say that Ludiades of Megalopolis, in the\r\nlifetime of Demetrius, of his own deliberate choice, and foreseeing\r\nwith great shrewdness and good sense what was going to happen, had\r\nabdicated his sovereignty and become a citizen of the national league.\r\nHis example was followed by Aristomachus, tyrant of Argos, Xeno of\r\nHermione, and Cleonymus of Phlius, who all likewise abdicated and\r\njoined the democratic league.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolians and Antigonus Doson, B.C. 229-220.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ But the increased power and national advancement which these\r\nevents brought to the Achaeans excited the envy of the Aetolians; who,\r\nbesides their natural inclination to unjust and selfish aggrandisement,\r\nwere inspired with the hope of breaking up the union of Achaean states,\r\nas they had before succeeded in partitioning those of Acarnania with\r\nAlexander,[159] and had planned to do those of Achaia with Antigonus\r\nGonatas. Instigated once more by similar expectations, they had now\r\nthe assurance to enter into communication and close alliance at once\r\nwith Antigonus (at that time ruling Macedonia as guardian of the\r\nyoung King Philip), and with Cleomenes, King of Sparta. They saw that\r\nAntigonus had undisputed possession of the throne of Macedonia, while\r\nhe was an open and avowed enemy of the Achaeans owing to the surprise\r\nof the Acrocorinthus; and they supposed that if they could get the\r\nLacedaemonians to join them in their hostility to the league, they\r\nwould easily subdue it, by selecting a favourable opportunity for\r\ntheir attack, and securing that it should be assaulted on all sides at\r\nonce. And they would in all probability have succeeded, but that they\r\nhad left out the most important element in the calculation, namely,\r\nthat in Aratus they had to reckon with an opponent to their plans of\r\nability equal to almost any emergency. Accordingly, when they attempted\r\nthis violent and unjust interference in Achaia, so far from succeeding\r\nin any of their devices, they, on the contrary, strengthened Aratus,\r\nthe then president of the league, as well as the league itself. So\r\nconsummate was the ability with which he foiled their plan and reduced\r\nthem to impotence. The manner in which this was done will be made clear\r\nin what I am about to relate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolians intrigue with Cleomenes, King of Sparta, B.C.\r\n229-227.]\r\n\r\n+46.+ There could be no doubt of the policy of the Aetolians. They\r\nwere ashamed indeed to attack the Achaeans openly, because they could\r\nnot ignore their recent obligations to them in the war with Demetrius:\r\nbut they were plotting with the Lacedaemonians; and showed their\r\njealousy of the Achaeans by not only conniving at the treacherous\r\nattack of Cleomenes upon Tegea, Mantinea, and Orchomenus (cities not\r\nonly in alliance with them, but actually members of their league), but\r\nby confirming his occupation of those places. In old times they had\r\nthought almost any excuse good enough to justify an appeal to arms\r\nagainst those who, after all, had done them no wrong: yet they now\r\nallowed themselves to be treated with such treachery, and submitted\r\nwithout remonstrance to the loss of the most important towns, solely\r\nwith the view of creating in Cleomenes a formidable antagonist to\r\nthe Achaeans. These facts were not lost upon Aratus and the other\r\nofficers of the league: and they resolved that, without taking the\r\ninitiative in going to war with any one, they would resist the attempts\r\nof the Lacedaemonians. Such was their determination, and for a time\r\nthey persisted in it: but immediately afterwards Cleomenes began to\r\nbuild the hostile fort in the territory of Megalopolis, called the\r\nAthenaeum,[160] and showed an undisguised and bitter hostility. Aratus\r\nand his colleagues accordingly summoned a meeting of the league, and it\r\nwas decided to proclaim war openly against Sparta.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenes, B.C. 227-221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus applies to Antigonus Doson.]\r\n\r\n+47.+ This was the origin of what is called the Cleomenic war. At\r\nfirst the Achaeans were for depending on their own resources for\r\nfacing the Lacedaemonians. They looked upon it as more honourable not\r\nto look to others for preservation, but to guard their own territory\r\nand cities themselves; and at the same time the remembrances of his\r\nformer services made them desirous of keeping up their friendship with\r\nPtolemy,[161] and averse from the appearance of seeking aid elsewhere.\r\nBut when the war had lasted some time; and Cleomenes had revolutionised\r\nthe constitution of his country, and had turned its constitutional\r\nmonarchy into a despotism; and, moreover, was conducting the war with\r\nextraordinary skill and boldness: seeing clearly what would happen, and\r\nfearing the reckless audacity of the Aetolians, Aratus determined that\r\nhis first duty was to be well beforehand in frustrating their plans. He\r\nsatisfied himself that Antigonus was a man of activity and practical\r\nability, with some pretensions to the character of a man of honour;\r\nhe however knew perfectly well that kings look on no man as a friend\r\nor foe from personal considerations, but ever measure friendships and\r\nenmities solely by the standard of expediency. He, therefore, conceived\r\nthe idea of addressing himself to this monarch, and entering into\r\nfriendly relations with him, taking occasion to point out to him the\r\ncertain result of his present policy. But to act openly in this matter\r\nhe thought inexpedient for several reasons. By doing so he would not\r\nonly incur the opposition of Cleomenes and the Aetolians, but would\r\ncause consternation among the Achaeans themselves, because his appeal\r\nto their enemies would give the impression that he had abandoned all\r\nthe hopes he once had in them. This was the very last idea he desired\r\nshould go abroad; and he therefore determined to conduct this intrigue\r\nin secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe result of this was that he was often compelled to speak and act\r\ntowards the public in a sense contrary to his true sentiments, that he\r\nmight conceal his real design by suggesting one of an exactly opposite\r\nnature. For which reason there are some particulars which he did not\r\neven commit to his own commentaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip II. in the Peloponnese, B.C. 338.]\r\n\r\n+48.+ It did not escape the observation of Aratus that the people of\r\nMegalopolis would be more ready than others to seek the protection of\r\nAntigonus, and the hopes of safety offered by Macedonia; for their\r\nneighbourhood to Sparta exposed them to attack before the other\r\nstates; while they were unable to get the help which they ought to\r\nhave, because the Achaeans were themselves hard pressed and in great\r\ndifficulties. Besides they had special reasons for entertaining\r\nfeelings of affection towards the royal family of Macedonia, founded\r\non the favours received in the time of Philip, son of Amyntas. He\r\ntherefore imparted his general design under pledge of secrecy to\r\nNicophanes and Cercidas of Megalopolis, who were family friends of\r\nhis own and of a character suited to the undertaking; and by their\r\nmeans experienced no difficulty in inducing the people of Megalopolis\r\nto send envoys to the league, to advise that an application for help\r\nshould be made to Antigonus. Nicophanes and Cercidas were themselves\r\nselected to go on this mission to the league, and thence, if their view\r\nwas accepted, to Antigonus. The league consented to allow the people\r\nof Megalopolis to send the mission; and accordingly Nicophanes lost no\r\ntime in obtaining an interview with the king. About the interests of\r\nhis own country he spoke briefly and summarily, confining himself to\r\nthe most necessary statements; the greater part of his speech was, in\r\naccordance with the directions of Aratus, concerned with the national\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The message to Antigonus Doson.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ The points suggested by Aratus for the envoy to dwell on were\r\n“the scope and object of the understanding between the Aetolians and\r\nCleomenes, and the necessity of caution on the part primarily of the\r\nAchaeans, but still more even on that of Antigonus himself: first,\r\nbecause the Achaeans plainly could not resist the attack of both; and,\r\nsecondly, because if the Aetolians and Cleomenes conquered them, any\r\nman of sense could easily see that they would not be satisfied or stop\r\nthere. For the encroaching spirit of the Aetolians, far from being\r\ncontent to be confined by the boundaries of the Peloponnese, would\r\nfind even those of Greece too narrow for them. Again, the ambition of\r\nCleomenes was at present directed to the supremacy in the Peloponnese:\r\nbut this obtained, he would promptly aim at that of all Greece, in\r\nwhich it would be impossible for him to succeed without first crushing\r\nthe government of Macedonia. They were, therefore, to urge him to\r\nconsider, with a view to the future, which of the two courses would\r\nbe the more to his own interests,—to fight for supremacy in Greece in\r\nconjunction with the Achaeans and Boeotians against Cleomenes in the\r\nPeloponnese; or to abandon the most powerful race, and to stake the\r\nMacedonian empire on a battle in Thessaly, against a combined force\r\nof Aetolians and Boeotians, with the Achaeans and Lacedaemonians to\r\nboot. If the Aetolians, from regard to the goodwill shown them by\r\nthe Achaeans in the time of Demetrius, were to pretend to be anxious\r\nto keep the peace as they were at present doing, they were to assert\r\nthat the Achaeans were ready to engage Cleomenes by themselves; and if\r\nfortune declared in their favour they would want no assistance from\r\nany one: but if fortune went against them, and the Aetolians joined\r\nin the attack, they begged him to watch the course of events, that he\r\nmight not let things go too far, but might aid the Peloponnesians while\r\nthey were still capable of being saved. He had no need to be anxious\r\nabout the good faith or gratitude of the Achaeans: when the time for\r\naction came, Aratus pledged himself to find guarantees which would be\r\nsatisfactory to both parties; and similarly would himself indicate the\r\nmoment at which the aid should be given.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus wishes to do without the king if possible.]\r\n\r\n+50.+ These arguments seemed to Antigonus to have been put by Aratus\r\nwith equal sincerity and ability: and after listening to them, he\r\neagerly took the first necessary step by writing a letter to the people\r\nof Megalopolis with an offer of assistance, on condition that such a\r\nmeasure should receive the consent of the Achaeans. When Nicophanes\r\nand Cercidas returned home and delivered this despatch from the king,\r\nreporting at the same time his other expressions of goodwill and zeal\r\nin the cause, the spirits of the people of Megalopolis were greatly\r\nelated; and they were all eagerness to attend the meeting of the\r\nleague, and urge that measures should be taken to secure the alliance\r\nof Antigonus, and to put the management of the war in his hands with\r\nall despatch. Aratus learnt privately from Nicophanes the king’s\r\nfeelings towards the league and towards himself; and was delighted\r\nthat his plan had not failed, and that he had not found the king\r\ncompletely alienated from himself, as the Aetolians hoped he would\r\nbe. He regarded it also as eminently favourable to his policy, that\r\nthe people of Megalopolis were so eager to use the Achaean league as\r\nthe channel of communication with Antigonus. For his first object was\r\nif possible to do without this assistance; but if he were compelled\r\nto have recourse to it, he wished that the invitation should not be\r\nsent through himself personally, but that it should rather come from\r\nthe Achaeans as a nation. For he feared that, if the king came, and\r\nconquered Cleomenes and the Lacedaemonians in the war, and should then\r\nadopt any policy hostile to the interests of the national constitution,\r\nhe would have himself by general consent to bear the blame of the\r\nresult: while Antigonus would be justified, by the injury which had\r\nbeen inflicted on the royal house of Macedonia in the matter of the\r\nAcrocorinthus. Accordingly when Megalopolitan envoys appeared in the\r\nnational council, and showed the royal despatch, and further declared\r\nthe general friendly disposition of the king, and added an appeal to\r\nthe congress to secure the king’s alliance without delay; and when also\r\nthe sense of the meeting was clearly shown to be in favour of taking\r\nthis course, Aratus rose, and, after setting forth the king’s zeal, and\r\ncomplimenting the meeting upon their readiness to act in the matter,\r\nhe proceeded to urge upon them in a long speech that “They should\r\ntry if possible to preserve their cities and territory by their own\r\nefforts, for that nothing could be more honourable or more expedient\r\nthan that: but that, if it turned out that fortune declared against\r\nthem in this effort, they might then have recourse to the assistance of\r\ntheir friends; but not until they had tried all their own resources to\r\nthe uttermost.” This speech was received with general applause: and it\r\nwas decided to take no fresh departure at present, and to endeavour to\r\nbring the existing war to a conclusion unaided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Euergetes jealous of the Macedonian policy of Aratus, helps\r\nCleomenes.]\r\n\r\n+51.+ But when Ptolemy, despairing of retaining the league’s\r\nfriendship, began to furnish Cleomenes with supplies,—which he did\r\nwith a view of setting him up as a foil to Antigonus, thinking the\r\nLacedaemonians offered him better hopes than the Achaeans of being able\r\nto thwart the policy of the Macedonian kings; and when the Achaeans\r\nthemselves had suffered three defeats,—one at Lycaeum in an engagement\r\nwith Cleomenes whom they had met on a march; and again in a pitched\r\nbattle at Ladocaea in the territory of Megalopolis, in which Lydiades\r\nfell; and a third time decisively at a place called Hecatomboeum in\r\nthe territory of Dyme where their whole forces had been engaged,—after\r\nthese misfortunes, no further delay was possible, and they were\r\ncompelled by the force of circumstances to appeal unanimously to\r\nAntigonus. Thereupon Aratus sent his son to Antigonus, and ratified\r\nthe terms of the subvention. The great difficulty was this: it was\r\nbelieved to be certain that the king would send no assistance, except\r\non the condition of the restoration of the Acrocorinthus, and of having\r\nthe city of Corinth put into his hands as a base of operations in this\r\nwar; and on the other hand it seemed impossible that the Achaeans\r\nshould venture to put the Corinthians in the king’s power against their\r\nown consent. The final determination of the matter was accordingly\r\npostponed, that they might investigate the question of the securities\r\nto be given to the king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaeans offer to surrender the Acrocorinthus to\r\nAntigonus.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ Meanwhile, on the strength of the dismay caused by his successes,\r\nCleomenes was making an unopposed progress through the cities,\r\nwinning some by persuasion and others by threats. In this way, he\r\ngot possession of Caphyae, Pellene, Pheneus, Argos, Phlius, Cleonae,\r\nEpidaurus, Hermione, Troezen, and last of all Corinth, while he\r\npersonally commanded a siege of Sicyon. But this in reality relieved\r\nthe Achaeans from a very grave difficulty. For the Corinthians by\r\nordering Aratus, as Strategus of the league, and the Achaeans to\r\nevacuate the town, and by sending messages to Cleomenes inviting his\r\npresence, gave the Achaeans a ground of action and a reasonable pretext\r\nfor moving. Aratus was quick to take advantage of this; and, as the\r\nAchaeans were in actual possession of the Acrocorinthus, he made his\r\npeace with the royal family of Macedonia by offering it to Antigonus;\r\nand at the same time gave thus a sufficient guarantee for friendship in\r\nthe future, and further secured Antigonus a base of operations for the\r\nwar with Sparta.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenes prepares to resist.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antigonus comes to the Isthmus, B.C. 224.]\r\n\r\nUpon learning of this compact between the league and Antigonus,\r\nCleomenes raised the siege of Sicyon and pitched his camp near the\r\nIsthmus; and, having thrown up a line of fortification uniting the\r\nAcrocorinthus with the mountain called the “Ass’s Back,” began from\r\nthis time to expect with confidence the empire of the Peloponnese. But\r\nAntigonus had made his preparations long in advance, in accordance with\r\nthe suggestion of Aratus, and was only waiting for the right moment to\r\nact. And now the news which he received convinced him that the entrance\r\nof Cleomenes into Thessaly, at the head of an army, was only a question\r\nof a very few days: he accordingly despatched envoys to Aratus and the\r\nleague to conclude the terms of the treaty[162] and marched to the\r\nIsthmus with his army by way of Euboea. He took this route because\r\nthe Aetolians, after trying other expedients for preventing Antigonus\r\nbringing this aid, now forbade his marching south of Thermopylae with\r\nan army, threatening that, if he did, they would offer armed opposition\r\nto his passage.\r\n\r\n+53.+ Thus Antigonus and Cleomenes were encamped face to face: the\r\nformer desirous of effecting an entrance into the Peloponnese,\r\nCleomenes determined to prevent him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaeans seize Argos.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Achaeans, in spite of their severe disasters, did\r\nnot abandon their purpose or give up all hopes of retrieving their\r\nfortunes. They gave Aristotle of Argos assistance when he headed\r\na rising against the Cleomenic faction; and, under the command of\r\nTimoxenus the Strategus, surprised and seized Argos. And this must be\r\nregarded as the chief cause of the improvement which took place in\r\ntheir fortunes; for this reverse checked the ardour of Cleomenes and\r\ndamped the courage of his soldiers in advance, as was clearly shown by\r\nwhat took place afterwards. For though Cleomenes had already possession\r\nof more advantageous posts, and was in the enjoyment of more abundant\r\nsupplies than Antigonus, and was at the same time inspired with\r\nsuperior courage and ambition: yet, as soon as he was informed that\r\nArgos was in the hands of the Achaeans, he at once drew back, abandoned\r\nall these advantages, and retreated from the Isthmus with every\r\nappearance of precipitation, in terror of being completely surrounded\r\nby his enemies. At first he retired upon Argos, and for a time made\r\nsome attempt to regain the town. But the Achaeans offered a gallant\r\nresistance; and the Argives themselves were stirred up to do the same\r\nby remorse for having admitted him before: and so, having failed in\r\nthis attempt also, he marched back to Sparta by way of Mantinea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antigonus receives the Acrocorinthus.]\r\n\r\n+54.+ On his part, Antigonus advanced without any casualty into the\r\nPeloponnese, and took over the Acrocorinthus; and, without wasting\r\ntime there, pushed on in his enterprise and entered Argos. He only\r\nstayed there long enough to compliment the Argives on their conduct,\r\nand to provide for the security of the city; and then immediately\r\nstarting again directed his march towards Arcadia; and after ejecting\r\nthe garrisons from the posts which had been fortified by Cleomenes in\r\nthe territories of Aegys and Belmina, and, putting those strongholds\r\nin the hands of the people of Megalopolis, he went to Aegium to attend\r\nthe meeting of the Achaean league. There he made a statement of his own\r\nproceedings, and consulted with the meeting as to the measures to be\r\ntaken in the future. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the allied\r\narmy, and went into winter quarters at Sicyon and Corinth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 223. Recovery of Tegea.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skirmish with Cleomenes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Orchomenus]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Mantinea]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Heraea and Telphusa.]\r\n\r\nAt the approach of spring he broke up his camp and got on the march.\r\nOn the third day he arrived at Tegea, and being joined there by the\r\nAchaean forces, he proceeded to regularly invest the city. But the\r\nvigour displayed by the Macedonians in conducting the siege, and\r\nespecially in the digging of mines, soon reduced the Tegeans to\r\ndespair, and they accordingly surrendered. After taking the proper\r\nmeasures for securing the town, Antigonus proceeded to extend his\r\nexpedition. He now marched with all speed into Laconia; and having\r\nfound Cleomenes in position on the frontier, he was trying to bring him\r\nto an engagement, and was harassing him with skirmishing attacks, when\r\nnews was brought to him by his scouts that the garrison of Orchomenus\r\nhad started to join Cleomenes. He at once broke up his camp, hurried\r\nthither, and carried the town by assault. Having done that, he next\r\ninvested Mantinea and began to besiege it. This town also being soon\r\nterrified into surrender by the Macedonians, he started again along the\r\nroad to Heraea and Telphusa. These towns, too, being secured by the\r\nvoluntary surrender of their inhabitants, as the winter was by this\r\ntime approaching, he went again to Aegium to attend the meeting of the\r\nleague. His Macedonian soldiers he sent away to winter at home, while\r\nhe himself remained to confer with the Achaeans on the existing state\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n+55.+ But Cleomenes was on the alert. He saw that the Macedonians in\r\nthe army of Antigonus had been sent home; and that the king and his\r\nmercenaries in Aegium were three days’ march from Megalopolis; and\r\nthis latter town he well knew to be difficult to guard, owing to its\r\ngreat extent, and the sparseness of its inhabitants; and, moreover,\r\nthat it was just then being kept with even greater carelessness than\r\nusual, owing to Antigonus being in the country; and what was more\r\nimportant than anything else, he knew that the larger number of its\r\nmen of military age had fallen at the battles of Lycaeum and Ladoceia.\r\nThere happened to be residing in Megalopolis some Messenian exiles; by\r\nwhose help he managed, under cover of night, to get within the walls\r\nwithout being detected. When day broke he had a narrow escape from\r\nbeing ejected, if not from absolute destruction, through the valour\r\nof the citizens. This had been his fortune three months before, when\r\nhe had made his way into the city by the region which is called the\r\nCōlaeum: but on this occasion, by the superiority of his force, and the\r\nseizure in advance of the strongest positions in the town, he succeeded\r\nin effecting his purpose. He eventually ejected the inhabitants,\r\nand took entire possession of the city; which, once in his power,\r\nhe dismantled in so savage and ruthless a manner as to preclude the\r\nleast hope that it might ever be restored. The reason of his acting in\r\nthis manner was, I believe, that Megalopolis and Stymphalus were the\r\nonly towns in which, during the vicissitudes of that period, he never\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a single partisan, or inducing a single citizen\r\nto turn traitor. For the passion for liberty and the loyalty of the\r\nClitorians had been stained by the baseness of one man, Thearces; whom\r\nthe Clitorians, with some reason, denied to be a native of their city,\r\nasserting that he had been foisted in from Orchomenus, and was the\r\noffspring of one of the foreign garrison there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Digression (to ch. 63) on the misstatements of Phylarchus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mantinea.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ For the history of the same period, with which we are now\r\nengaged, there are two authorities, Aratus and Phylarchus,[163] whose\r\nopinions are opposed in many points and their statements contradictory.\r\nI think, therefore, it will be advantageous, or rather necessary, since\r\nI follow Aratus in my account of the Cleomenic war, to go into the\r\nquestion; and not by any neglect on my part to suffer misstatements in\r\nhistorical writings to enjoy an authority equal to that of truth. The\r\nfact is that the latter of these two writers has, throughout the whole\r\nof his history, made statements at random and without discrimination.\r\nIt is not, however, necessary for me to criticise him on other points\r\non the present occasion, or to call him to strict account concerning\r\nthem; but such of his statements as relate to the period which I have\r\nnow in hand, that is the Cleomenic war, these I must thoroughly sift.\r\nThey will be quite sufficient to enable us to form a judgment on the\r\ngeneral spirit and ability with which he approaches historical writing.\r\nIt was his object to bring into prominence the cruelty of Antigonus\r\nand the Macedonians, as well as that of Aratus and the Achaeans; and\r\nhe accordingly asserts that, when Mantinea fell into their hands, it\r\nwas cruelly treated; and that the most ancient and important of all\r\nthe Arcadian towns was involved in calamities so terrible as to move\r\nall Greece to horror and tears. And being eager to stir the hearts\r\nof his readers to pity, and to enlist their sympathies by his story,\r\nhe talks of women embracing, tearing their hair, and exposing their\r\nbreasts; and again of the tears and lamentations of men and women, led\r\noff into captivity along with their children and aged parents. And\r\nthis he does again and again throughout his whole history, by way of\r\nbringing the terrible scene vividly before his readers. I say nothing\r\nof the unworthiness and unmanliness of the course he has adopted: let\r\nus only inquire what is essential and to the purpose in history. Surely\r\nan historian’s object should not be to amaze his readers by a series\r\nof thrilling anecdotes; nor should he aim at producing speeches which\r\n_might_ have been delivered, nor study dramatic propriety in details\r\nlike a writer of tragedy: but his function is above all to record\r\nwith fidelity what was actually said or done, however commonplace\r\nit may be. For the purposes of history and of the drama are not the\r\nsame, but widely opposed to each other. In the former the object is\r\nto strike and delight by words as true to nature as possible; in the\r\nlatter to instruct and convince by genuine words and deeds; in the\r\nformer the effect is meant to be temporary, in the latter permanent.\r\nIn the former, again, the power of carrying an audience is the chief\r\nexcellence, because the object is to create illusion; but in the latter\r\nthe thing of primary importance is truth, because the object is to\r\nbenefit the learner. And apart from these considerations, Phylarchus,\r\nin most of the catastrophes which he relates, omits to suggest the\r\ncauses which gave rise to them, or the course of events which led up\r\nto them: and without knowing these, it is impossible to feel the due\r\nindignation or pity at anything which occurs. For instance, everybody\r\nlooks upon it as an outrage that the free should be struck: still,\r\nif a man provokes it by an act of violence, he is considered to have\r\ngot no more than he deserved; and, where it is done for correction\r\nand discipline, those who strike free men are deemed worthy of honour\r\nand gratitude. Again, the killing of a fellow-citizen is regarded\r\nas a heinous crime, deserving the severest penalties: and yet it is\r\nnotorious that the man who kills a thief, or his wife’s paramour, is\r\nheld guiltless; while he who kills a traitor or tyrant in every country\r\nreceives honours and pre-eminence. And so in everything our final\r\njudgment does not depend upon the mere things done, but upon their\r\ncauses and the views of the actors, according as these differ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 227.]\r\n\r\n+57.+ Now the people of Mantinea had in the first instance abandoned\r\nthe league, and voluntarily submitted, first to the Aetolians,\r\nand afterwards to Cleomenes. Being therefore, in accordance with\r\nthis policy, members of the Lacedaemonian community, in the fourth\r\nyear before the coming of Antigonus, their city was forcibly taken\r\npossession of by the Achaeans owing to the skilful plotting of Aratus.\r\nBut on that occasion, so far from being subjected to any severity\r\nfor their act of treason, it became a matter of general remark how\r\npromptly the feelings of the conquerors and the conquered underwent a\r\nrevolution. As soon as he had got possession of the town, Aratus issued\r\norders to his own men that no one was to lay a finger on anything\r\nthat did not belong to him; and then, having summoned the Mantineans\r\nto a meeting, he bade them be of good cheer, and stay in their own\r\nhouses; for that, as long as they remained members of the league,\r\ntheir safety was secured. On their part, the Mantineans, surprised\r\nat this unlooked-for prospect of safety, immediately experienced a\r\nuniversal revulsion of feeling. The very men against whom they had\r\na little while before been engaged in a war, in which they had seen\r\nmany of their kinsfolk killed, and no small number grievously wounded,\r\nthey now received into their houses, and entertained as their guests,\r\ninterchanging every imaginable kindness with them. And naturally so.\r\nFor I believe that there never were men who met with more kindly foes,\r\nor came out of a struggle with what seemed the most dreadful disasters\r\nmore scatheless, than did the Mantineans, owing to the humanity of\r\nAratus and the Achaeans towards them.\r\n\r\n+58.+ But they still saw certain dangers ahead from intestine\r\ndisorders, and the hostile designs of the Aetolians and Lacedaemonians;\r\nthey subsequently, therefore, sent envoys to the league asking for a\r\nguard for their town. The request was granted: and three hundred of\r\nthe league army were selected by lot to form it. These men on whom the\r\nlot fell started for Mantinea; and, abandoning their native cities\r\nand their callings in life, remained there to protect the lives and\r\nliberties of the citizens. Besides them, the league despatched two\r\nhundred mercenaries, who joined the Achaean guard in protecting the\r\nestablished constitution. But this state of things did not last long:\r\nan insurrection broke out in the town, and the Mantineans called in the\r\naid of the Lacedaemonians; delivered the city into their hands; and\r\nput to death the garrison sent by the league. It would not be easy to\r\nmention a grosser or blacker act of treachery. Even if they resolved to\r\nutterly set at nought the gratitude they owed to, and the friendship\r\nthey had formed with, the league; they ought at least to have spared\r\nthese men, and to have let every one of them depart under some terms\r\nor another: for this much it is the custom by the law of nations to\r\ngrant even to foreign enemies. But in order to satisfy Cleomenes and\r\nthe Lacedaemonians of their fidelity in the policy of the hour, they\r\ndeliberately, and in violation of international law, consummated a\r\ncrime of the most impious description. To slaughter and wreak vengeance\r\non the men who had just before taken their city, and refrained from\r\ndoing them the least harm, and who were at that very moment engaged in\r\nprotecting their lives and liberties,—can anything be imagined more\r\ndetestable? What punishment can be conceived to correspond with its\r\nenormity? If one suggests that they would be rightly served by being\r\nsold into slavery, with their wives and children, as soon as they were\r\nbeaten in war; it may be answered that this much is only what, by the\r\nlaws of warfare, awaits even those who have been guilty of no special\r\nact of impiety. They deserved therefore to meet with a punishment even\r\nmore complete and heavy than they did; so that, even if what Phylarchus\r\nmentions did happen to them, there was no reason for the pity of Greece\r\nbeing bestowed on them: praise and approval rather were due to those\r\nwho exacted vengeance for their impious crime. But since, as a matter\r\nof fact, nothing worse befel the Mantineans than the plunder of their\r\nproperty and the selling of their free citizens into slavery, this\r\nhistorian, for the mere sake of a sensational story, has not only told\r\na pure lie, but an improbable lie. His wilful ignorance also was so\r\nsupreme, that he was unable to compare with this alleged cruelty of the\r\nAchaeans the conduct of the same people in the case of Tegea, which\r\nthey took by force at the same period, and yet did no injury to its\r\ninhabitants. And yet, if the natural cruelty of the perpetrators was\r\nthe sole cause of the severity to Mantinea, it is to be presumed that\r\nTegea would have been treated in the same way. But if their treatment\r\nof Mantinea was an exception to that of every other town, the necessary\r\ninference is that the cause for their anger was exceptional also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aristomachus.]\r\n\r\n+59.+ Again Phylarchus says that Aristomachus the Argive, a man of\r\na most distinguished family, who had been despot of Argos, as his\r\nfathers had been before him, upon falling into the hands of Antigonus\r\nand the league “was hurried off to Cenchreae and there racked to\r\ndeath,—an unparalleled instance of injustice and cruelty.” But in this\r\nmatter also our author preserves his peculiar method. He makes up a\r\nstory about certain cries of this man, when he was on the rack, being\r\nheard through the night by the neighbours: “some of whom,” he says,\r\n“rushed to the house in their horror, or incredulity, or indignation\r\nat the outrage.” As for the sensational story, let it pass; I have\r\nsaid enough on that point. But I must express my opinion that, even\r\nif Aristomachus had committed no crime against the Achaeans besides,\r\nyet his whole life and his treason to his own country deserved the\r\nheaviest possible punishment. And in order, forsooth, to enhance this\r\nman’s reputation, and move his reader’s sympathies for his sufferings,\r\nour historian remarks that he had not only been a tyrant himself,\r\nbut that his fathers had been so before him. It would not be easy to\r\nbring a graver or more bitter charge against a man than this: for the\r\nmere word “tyrant” involves the idea of everything that is wickedest,\r\nand includes every injustice and crime possible to mankind. And if\r\nAristomachus endured the most terrible tortures, as Phylarchus says,\r\nhe yet would not have been sufficiently punished for the crime of one\r\nday, in which, when Aratus had effected an entrance into Argos with the\r\nAchaean soldiers,—and after supporting the most severe struggles and\r\ndangers for the freedom of its citizens, had eventually been driven\r\nout, because the party within who were in league with him had not\r\nventured to stir, for fear of the tyrant,—Aristomachus availed himself\r\nof the pretext of their complicity with the irruption of the Achaeans\r\nto put to the rack and execute eighty of the leading citizens, who were\r\nperfectly innocent, in the presence of their relations. I pass by the\r\nhistory of his whole life and the crimes of his ancestors; for that\r\nwould be too long a story.\r\n\r\n+60.+ But this shows that we ought not to be indignant if a man reaps\r\nas he has sown; but rather if he is allowed to end his days in peace,\r\nwithout experiencing such retribution at all. Nor ought we to accuse\r\nAntigonus or Aratus of crime, for having racked and put to death a\r\ntyrant whom they had captured in war: to have killed and wreaked\r\nvengeance on whom, even in time of peace, would have brought praise and\r\nhonour to the doers from all right-minded persons.\r\n\r\nBut when, in addition to these crimes, he was guilty also of treachery\r\nto the league, what shall we say that he deserved? The facts of the\r\ncase are these. He abdicted his sovereignty of Argos shortly before,\r\nfinding himself in difficulties, owing to the state of affairs brought\r\non by the death of Demetrius. He was, however, protected by the\r\nclemency and generosity of the league; and, much to his own surprise,\r\nwas left unmolested. For the Achaean government not only secured him an\r\nindemnity for all crimes committed by him while despot, but admitted\r\nhim as a member of the league, and invested him with the highest office\r\nin it,—that, namely, of Commander-in-Chief and Strategus.[164] All\r\nthese favours he immediately forgot, as soon as his hopes were a little\r\nraised by the Cleomenic war; and at a crisis of the utmost importance\r\nhe withdrew his native city, as well as his own personal adhesion,\r\nfrom the league, and attached them to its enemies. For such an act of\r\ntreason what he deserved was not to be racked under cover of night at\r\nCenchreae, and then put to death, as Phylarchus says: he ought to have\r\nbeen taken from city to city in the Peloponnese, and to have ended his\r\nlife only after exemplary torture in each of them. And yet the only\r\nseverity that this guilty wretch had to endure was to be drowned in the\r\nsea by order of the officers at Cenchreae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Megalopolis.]\r\n\r\n+61.+ There is another illustration of this writer’s manner to be\r\nfound in his treatment of the cases of Mantinea and Megalopolis. The\r\nmisfortunes of the former he has depicted with his usual exaggeration\r\nand picturesqueness: apparently from the notion, that it is the\r\npeculiar function of an historian to select for special mention only\r\nsuch actions as are conspicuously bad. But about the noble conduct\r\nof the Megalopolitans at that same period he has not said a word: as\r\nthough it were the province of history to deal with crimes rather than\r\nwith instances of just and noble conduct; or as though his readers\r\nwould be less improved by the record of what is great and worthy of\r\nimitation, than by that of such deeds as are base and fit only to be\r\navoided. For instance, he has told us clearly enough how Cleomenes\r\ntook the town, preserved it from damage, and forthwith sent couriers\r\nto the Megalopolitans in Messene with a despatch, offering them the\r\nsafe enjoyment of their country if they would throw in their lot with\r\nhim;—and his object in telling all this is to enhance the magnanimity\r\nand moderation of Cleomenes towards his enemies. Nay, he has gone\r\nfarther, and told us how the people of Megalopolis would not allow\r\nthe letter to be read to the end, and were not far from stoning the\r\nbearers of it. Thus much he does tell us. But the sequel to this, so\r\nappropriate to an historian,—the commendation, I mean, and honourable\r\nmention of their noble conduct,—this he has altogether left out. And\r\nyet he had an opportunity ready to his hand. For if we view with\r\napproval the conduct of a people who merely by their declarations and\r\nvotes support a war in behalf of friends and allies; while to those\r\nwho go so far as to endure the devastation of their territory, and a\r\nsiege of their town, we give not only praise but active gratitude:\r\nwhat must be our estimate of the people of Megalopolis? Must it not\r\nbe of the most exalted character? First of all, they allowed their\r\nterritory to be at the mercy of Cleomenes, and then consented to be\r\nentirely deprived of their city, rather than be false to the league:\r\nand, finally, in spite of an unexpected chance of recovering it, they\r\ndeliberately preferred the loss of their territory, the tombs of their\r\nancestors, their temples, their homes and property, of everything in\r\nfact which men value most, to forfeiting their faith to their allies.\r\nNo nobler action has ever been, or ever will be performed; none to\r\nwhich an historian could better draw his reader’s attention. For what\r\ncould be a higher incentive to good faith, or the maintenance of frank\r\nand permanent relations between states? But of all this Phylarchus says\r\nnot a word, being, as it seems to me, entirely blind as to all that is\r\nnoblest and best suited to be the theme of an historian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and its wealth.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 378.]\r\n\r\n+62.+ He does, however, state in the course of his narrative that,\r\nfrom the spoils of Megalopolis, six thousand talents fell to the\r\nLacedaemonians, of which two thousand, according to custom, were given\r\nto Cleomenes. This shows, to begin with, an astounding ignorance of the\r\nordinary facts as to the resources of Greece: a knowledge which above\r\nall others should be possessed by historians. I am not of course now\r\nspeaking of the period in which the Peloponnese had been ruined by the\r\nMacedonian kings, and still more completely by a long continuance of\r\nintestine struggles; but of our own times, in which it is believed, by\r\nthe establishment of its unity, to be enjoying the highest prosperity\r\nof which it is capable. Still even at this period, if you could\r\ncollect all the movable property of the whole Peloponnese (leaving\r\nout the value of slaves), it would be impossible to get so large a\r\nsum of money together. That I speak on good grounds and not at random\r\nwill appear from the following fact. Every one has read that when the\r\nAthenians, in conjunction with the Thebans, entered upon the war with\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, and despatched an army of twenty thousand men,\r\nand manned a hundred triremes, they resolved to supply the expenses\r\nof the war by the assessment of a property tax; and accordingly had a\r\nvaluation taken, not only of the whole land of Attica and the houses in\r\nit, but of all other property: but yet the value returned fell short\r\nof six thousand talents by two hundred and fifty; which will show that\r\nwhat I have just said about the Peloponnese is not far wide of the\r\nmark. But at this period the most exaggerated estimate could scarcely\r\ngive more than three hundred talents, as coming from Megalopolis\r\nitself; for it is acknowledged that most of the inhabitants, free and\r\nslaves, escaped to Messene. But the strongest confirmation of my words\r\nis the case of Mantinea, which, as he himself observes, was second to\r\nno Arcadian city in wealth and numbers. Though it was surrendered after\r\na siege, so that no one could escape, and no property could without\r\ngreat difficulty be concealed; yet the value of the whole spoil of the\r\ntown, including the price of the captives sold, amounted at this same\r\nperiod to only three hundred talents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy Euergetes and Cleomenes.]\r\n\r\n+63.+ But a more astonishing misstatement remains to be remarked. In\r\nthe course of his history of this war, Phylarchus asserts “that about\r\nten days before the battle an ambassador came from Ptolemy announcing\r\nto Cleomenes, that the king declined to continue to support him with\r\nsupplies, and advised him to make terms with Antigonus. And that when\r\nthis message had been delivered to Cleomenes, he made up his mind that\r\nhe had better put his fortune to the supreme test as soon as possible,\r\nbefore his forces learnt about this message, because he could not hope\r\nto provide the soldiers’ pay from his own resources.” But if he had\r\nat that very time become the master of six thousand talents, he would\r\nhave been better supplied than Ptolemy himself. And as for war with\r\nAntigonus, if he had become master of only three hundred talents, he\r\nwould have been able to continue it without any difficulty. But the\r\nwriter states two inconsistent propositions—that Cleomenes depended\r\nwholly on Ptolemy for money: and that he at the same time had become\r\nmaster of that enormous sum. Is this not irrational, and grossly\r\ncareless besides? I might mention many instances of a similar kind, not\r\nonly in his account of this period, but throughout his whole work; but\r\nI think for my present purpose enough has been said.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 222. Cleomenes invades Argos.]\r\n\r\n+64.+ Megalopolis having fallen, then, Antigonus spent the winter at\r\nArgos. But at the approach of spring Cleomenes collected his army,\r\naddressed a suitable exhortation to them, and led them into the Argive\r\nterritory. Most people thought this a hazardous and foolhardy step,\r\nbecause the places at which the frontier was crossed were strongly\r\nfortified; but those who were capable of judging regarded the measure\r\nas at once safe and prudent. For seeing that Antigonus had dismissed\r\nhis forces, he reckoned on two things,—there would be no one to resist\r\nhim, and therefore he would run no risk; and when the Argives found\r\nthat their territory was being laid waste up to their walls, they would\r\nbe certain to be roused to anger and to lay the blame upon Antigonus:\r\ntherefore, if on the one hand Antigonus, unable to bear the complaints\r\nof the populace, were to sally forth and give him battle with his\r\npresent forces, Cleomenes felt sure of an easy victory; but if on the\r\nother hand Antigonus refused to alter his plans, and kept persistently\r\naloof, he believed that he would be able to effect a safe retreat home,\r\nafter succeeding by this expedition in terrifying his enemies and\r\ninspiring his own forces with courage. And this was the actual result.\r\nFor as the devastation of the country went on, crowds began to collect\r\nand abuse Antigonus: but like a wise general and king, he refused\r\nto allow any consideration to outweigh that of sound strategy, and\r\npersisted in remaining inactive. Accordingly Cleomenes, in pursuance of\r\nhis plan, having terrified his enemies and inspired courage in his own\r\narmy for the coming struggle, returned home unmolested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The summer campaign. The army of Antigonus.]\r\n\r\n+65.+ Summer having now come, and the Macedonian and Achaean soldiers\r\nhaving assembled from their winter quarters, Antigonus moved his army,\r\nalong with his allies, into Laconia. The main force consisted of ten\r\nthousand Macedonians for the phalanx, three thousand light armed, and\r\nthree hundred cavalry. With these were a thousand Agraei; the same\r\nnumber of Gauls; three thousand mercenary infantry, and three hundred\r\ncavalry; picked troops of the Achaeans, three thousand infantry and\r\nthree hundred cavalry; and a thousand Megalopolitans armed in the\r\nMacedonian manner, under the command of Cercidas of Megalopolis. Of\r\nthe allies there were two thousand infantry, and two hundred cavalry,\r\nfrom Boeotia; a thousand infantry and fifty cavalry from Epirus; the\r\nsame number from Acarnania; and sixteen hundred from Illyria, under\r\nthe command of Demetrius of Pharos. The whole amounted to twenty-eight\r\nthousand infantry and twelve hundred cavalry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The position of Cleomenes at Sellasia.]\r\n\r\nCleomenes had expected the attack, and had secured the passes into the\r\ncountry by posting garrisons, digging trenches, and felling trees;\r\nwhile he took up position at a place called Sellasia, with an army\r\namounting to twenty thousand, having calculated that the invading\r\nforces would take that direction: which turned out to be the case. This\r\npass lies between two hills, called respectively Evas and Olympus, and\r\nthe road to Sparta follows the course of the river Oenus. Cleomenes\r\nstrengthened both these hills by lines of fortification, consisting of\r\ntrench and palisade. On Evas he posted the perioeci and allies, under\r\nthe command of his brother Eucleidas; while he himself held Olympus\r\nwith the Lacedaemonians and mercenaries. On the level ground along the\r\nriver he stationed his cavalry, with a division of his mercenaries,\r\non both sides of the road. When Antigonus arrived, he saw at once\r\nthe strength of the position, and the skill with which Cleomenes had\r\nselected the different branches of his army to occupy the points of\r\nvantage, so that the whole aspect of the position was like that of\r\nskilled soldiers drawn up ready for a charge. For no preparation for\r\nattack or defence had been omitted; but everything was in order, either\r\nfor offering battle with effect, or for holding an almost unassailable\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n+66.+ The sight of these preparations decided Antigonus not to make an\r\nimmediate attack upon the position, or rashly hazard an engagement. He\r\npitched his camp a short distance from it, covering his front by the\r\nstream called Gorgylus, and there remained for some days; informing\r\nhimself by reconnaissances of the peculiarities of the ground and the\r\ncharacter of the troops, and at the same time endeavouring by feigned\r\nmovements to elicit the intentions of the enemy. But he could never\r\nfind an unguarded point, or one where the troops were not entirely\r\non the alert, for Cleomenes was always ready at a moment’s notice to\r\nbe at any point that was attacked. He therefore gave up all thoughts\r\nof attacking the position; and finally an understanding was come to\r\nbetween him and Cleomenes to bring the matter to the decision of\r\nbattle. And, indeed, Fortune had there brought into competition two\r\ncommanders equally endowed by nature with military skill. To face\r\nthe division of the enemy on Evas Antigonus stationed his Macedonian\r\nhoplites with brazen shields, and the Illyrians, drawn up in alternate\r\nlines, under the command of Alexander, son of Acmetus, and Demetrius\r\nof Pharos, respectively. Behind them he placed the Acarnanians and\r\nCretans, and behind them again were two thousand Achaeans to act\r\nas a reserve. His cavalry, on the banks of the river Oenous, were\r\nposted opposite the enemy’s cavalry, under the command of Alexander,\r\nand flanked by a thousand Achaean infantry and the same number of\r\nMegalopolitans. Antigonus himself determined to lead his mercenaries\r\nand Macedonian troops in person against the division on Olympus\r\ncommanded by Cleomenes. Owing to the narrowness of the ground, the\r\nMacedonians were arranged in a double phalanx, one close behind the\r\nother, while the mercenaries were placed in front of them. It was\r\narranged that the Illyrians, who had bivouacked in full order during\r\nthe previous night along the river Gorgylus, close to the foot of Evas,\r\nwere to begin their assault on the hill when they saw a flag of linen\r\nraised from the direction of Olympus; and that the Megalopolitans and\r\ncavalry should do the same when the king raised a scarlet flag.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Sellasia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philopoemen’s presence of mind.]\r\n\r\n+67.+ The moment for beginning the battle had come: the signal was\r\ngiven to the Illyrians, and the word passed by the officers to their\r\nmen to do their duty, and in a moment they started into view of the\r\nenemy and began assaulting the hill. But the light-armed troops who\r\nwere stationed with Cleomenes’s cavalry, observing that the Achaean\r\nlines were not covered by any other troops behind them, charged them\r\non the rear; and thus reduced the division while endeavouring to carry\r\nthe hill of Evas to a state of great peril,—being met as they were on\r\ntheir front by Eucleidas from the top of the hill, and being charged\r\nand vigorously attacked by the light-armed mercenaries on their rear.\r\nIt was at this point that Philopoemen of Megalopolis, with a clear\r\nunderstanding of the situation and a foresight of what would happen,\r\nvainly endeavoured to point out the certain result to his superior\r\nofficers. They disregarded him for his want of experience in command\r\nand his extreme youth; and, accordingly he acted for himself, and\r\ncheering on the men of his own city, made a vigorous charge on the\r\nenemy. This effected a diversion; for the light-armed mercenaries,\r\nwho were engaged in harassing the rear of the party ascending Evas,\r\nhearing the shouting and seeing the cavalry engaged, abandoned their\r\nattack upon this party and hurried back to their original position to\r\nrender assistance to the cavalry. The result was that the division of\r\nIllyrians, Macedonians, and the rest who were advancing with them, no\r\nlonger had their attention diverted by an attack upon their rear, and\r\nso continued their advance upon the enemy with high spirits and renewed\r\nconfidence. And this afterwards caused it to be acknowledged that to\r\nPhilopoemen was due the honour of the success against Eucleidas.\r\n\r\n+68.+ It is clear that Antigonus at any rate entertained that opinion,\r\nfor after the battle he asked Alexander, the commander of the cavalry,\r\nwith the view of convicting him of his shortcoming, “Why he had engaged\r\nbefore the signal was given?” And upon Alexander answering that “He had\r\nnot done so, but that a young officer from Megalopolis had presumed to\r\nanticipate the signal, contrary to his wish:” Antigonus replied, “That\r\nyoung man acted like a good general in grasping the situation; you,\r\ngeneral, were the youngster.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Eucleidas.]\r\n\r\nWhat Eucleidas ought to have done, when he saw the enemy’s lines\r\nadvancing, was to have rushed down at once upon them; thrown their\r\nranks into disorder; and then retired himself, step by step, to\r\ncontinually higher ground into a safe position: for by thus breaking\r\nthem up and depriving them, to begin with, of the advantages of their\r\npeculiar armour and disposition, he would have secured the victory by\r\nthe superiority of his position. But he did the very opposite of all\r\nthis, and thereby forfeited the advantages of the ground. As though\r\nvictory were assured, he kept his original position on the summit of\r\nthe hill, with the view of catching the enemy at as great an elevation\r\nas possible, that their flight might be all the longer over steep and\r\nprecipitous ground. The result, as might have been anticipated, was\r\nexactly the reverse. For he left himself no place of retreat, and by\r\nallowing the enemy to reach his position, unharmed and in unbroken\r\norder, he was placed at the disadvantage of having to give them battle\r\non the very summit of the hill; and so, as soon as he was forced by the\r\nweight of their heavy armour and their close order to give any ground,\r\nit was immediately occupied by the Illyrians; while his own men were\r\nobliged to take lower ground, because they had no space for manœuvring\r\non the top. The result was not long in arriving: they suffered a\r\nrepulse, which the difficult and precipitous nature of the ground over\r\nwhich they had to retire turned into a disastrous flight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Cleomenes.]\r\n\r\n+69.+ Simultaneously with these events the cavalry engagement was also\r\nbeing brought to a decision; in which all the Achaean cavalry, and\r\nespecially Philopoemen, fought with conspicuous gallantry, for to them\r\nit was a contest for freedom. Philopoemen himself had his horse killed\r\nunder him, and while fighting accordingly on foot received a severe\r\nwound through both his thighs. Meanwhile the two kings on the other\r\nhill Olympus began by bringing their light-armed troops and mercenaries\r\ninto action, of which each of them had five thousand. Both the kings\r\nand their entire armies had a full view of this action, which was\r\nfought with great gallantry on both sides: the charges taking place\r\nsometimes in detachments, and at other times along the whole line, and\r\nan eager emulation being displayed between the several ranks, and even\r\nbetween individuals. But when Cleomenes saw that his brother’s division\r\nwas retreating, and that the cavalry in the low ground were on the\r\npoint of doing the same, alarmed at the prospect of an attack at all\r\npoints at once, he was compelled to demolish the palisade in his front,\r\nand to lead out his whole force in line by one side of his position.\r\nA recall was sounded on the bugle for the light-armed troops of both\r\nsides, who were on the ground between the two armies: and the phalanxes\r\nshouting their war cries, and with spears couched, charged each other.\r\nThen a fierce struggle arose: the Macedonians sometimes slowly giving\r\nground and yielding to the superior courage of the soldiers of Sparta,\r\nand at another time the Lacedaemonians being forced to give way before\r\nthe overpowering weight of the Macedonian phalanx. At length Antigonus\r\nordered a charge in close order and in double phalanx; the enormous\r\nweight of this peculiar formation proved sufficient to finally dislodge\r\nthe Lacedaemonians from their strongholds, and they fled in disorder\r\nand suffering severely as they went. Cleomenes himself, with a guard\r\nof cavalry, effected his retreat to Sparta: but the same night he went\r\ndown to Gythium, where all preparations for crossing the sea had been\r\nmade long before in case of mishap, and with his friends sailed to\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\n+70.+ Having surprised and taken Sparta, Antigonus treated the citizens\r\nwith magnanimity and humanity; and after re-establishing their ancient\r\nconstitution, he left the town in a few days, on receiving intelligence\r\nthat the Illyrians had invaded Macedonia and were laying waste the\r\ncountry. This was an instance of the fantastic way in which Fortune\r\ndecides the most important matters. For if Cleomenes had only put off\r\nthe battle for a few days, or if when he returned to Sparta he had only\r\nheld out for a brief space of time, he would have saved his crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Antigonus Doson, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\nAs it was, Antigonus after going to Tegea and restoring its\r\nconstitution, arrived on the second day at Argos, at the very time\r\nof the Nemean games. Having at this assembly received every mark of\r\nimmortal honour and glory at the hands of the Achaean community, as\r\nwell as of the several states, he made all haste to reach Macedonia.\r\nHe found the Illyrians still in the country, and forced them to give\r\nhim battle, in which, though he proved entirely successful, he exerted\r\nhimself to such a pitch in shouting encouragement to his men, that\r\nhe ruptured a bloodvessel, and fell into an illness which terminated\r\nshortly in his death. He was a great loss to the Greeks, whom he had\r\ninspired with good hopes, not only by his support in the field, but\r\nstill more by his character and good principles. He left the kingdom of\r\nMacedonia to Philip, son of Demetrius.\r\n\r\n+71.+ My reason for writing about this war at such length, was the\r\nadvisability, or rather necessity, in view of the general purpose of my\r\nhistory, of making clear the relations existing between Macedonia and\r\nGreece at a time which coincides with the period of which I am about to\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 284-280. B.C. 224-220.]\r\n\r\nJust about the same time, by the death of Euergetes, Ptolemy Philopator\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Egypt. At the same period died Seleucus,\r\nson of that Seleucus who had the double surnames of Callinicus\r\nand Pogon: he was succeeded on the throne of Syria by his brother\r\nAntiochus. The deaths of these three sovereigns—Antigonus, Ptolemy,\r\nand Seleucus—fell in the same Olympiad, as was the case with the three\r\nimmediate successors to Alexander the Great,—Seleucus, Ptolemy, and\r\nLysimachus,—for the latter all died in the 124th Olympiad, and the\r\nformer in the 139th.\r\n\r\nI may now fitly close this book. I have completed the introduction and\r\nlaid the foundation on which my history must rest. I have shown when,\r\nhow, and why the Romans, after becoming supreme in Italy, began to\r\naim at dominion outside of it, and to dispute with the Carthaginians\r\nthe dominion of the sea. I have at the same time explained the state\r\nof Greece, Macedonia, and Carthage at this epoch. I have now arrived\r\nat the period which I originally marked out,—that namely in which\r\nthe Greeks were on the point of beginning the Social, the Romans the\r\nHannibalic war, and the kings in Asia the war for the possession of\r\nCoele-Syria. The termination therefore of the wars just described, and\r\nthe death of the princes engaged in them, forms a natural period to\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n+1.+ I stated in my first book that my work was to start from the\r\nSocial war, the Hannibalian war, and the war for the possession of\r\nCoele-Syria. In the same book I stated my reasons for devoting my first\r\ntwo books to a sketch of the period preceding those events. I will now,\r\nafter a few prefatory remarks as to the scope of my own work, address\r\nmyself to giving a complete account of these wars, the causes which led\r\nto them, and which account for the proportions to which they attained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A summary of the work from B.C. 220 to B.C. 168.]\r\n\r\nThe one aim and object, then, of all that I have undertaken to write is\r\nto show how, when, and why all the known parts of the world fell under\r\nthe dominion of Rome. Now as this great event admits of being exactly\r\ndated as to its beginning, duration, and final accomplishment, I think\r\nit will be advantageous to give, by way of preface, a summary statement\r\nof the most important phases in it between the beginning and the end.\r\nFor I think I shall thus best secure to the student an adequate idea\r\nof my whole plan, for as the comprehension of the whole is a help to\r\nthe understanding of details, and the knowledge of details of great\r\nservice to the clear conception of the whole; believing that the best\r\nand clearest knowledge is that which is obtained from a combination\r\nof these, I will preface my whole history by a brief summary of its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220-216.]\r\n\r\nI have already described its scope and limits. As to its several parts,\r\nthe first consists of the above mentioned wars, while the conclusion or\r\nclosing scene is the fall of the Macedonian monarchy. The time included\r\nbetween these limits is fifty-three years, and never has an equal space\r\nembraced events of such magnitude and importance. In describing them I\r\nshall start from the 140th Olympiad and shall arrange my exposition in\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. The cause and course of the Hannibalian war.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ First I shall indicate the causes of the Punic or Hannibalian war:\r\nand shall have to describe how the Carthaginians entered Italy; broke\r\nup the Roman power there; made the Romans tremble for their safety\r\nand the very soil of their country; and contrary to all calculation\r\nacquired a good prospect of surprising Rome itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Macedonian treaty with Carthage, B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\nI shall next try to make it clear how in the same period Philip of\r\nMacedon, after finishing his war with the Aetolians, and subsequently\r\nsettling the affairs of Greece, entered upon a design of forming an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance with Carthage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Syrian war, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\nThen I shall tell how Antiochus and Ptolemy Philopator first quarrelled\r\nand finally went to war with each other for the possession of\r\nCoele-Syria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. Byzantine war, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\nNext how the Rhodians and Prusias went to war with the Byzantines, and\r\ncompelled them to desist from exacting dues from ships sailing into the\r\nPontus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First digression on the Roman Constitution.]\r\n\r\nAt this point I shall pause in my narrative to introduce a disquisition\r\nupon the Roman Constitution, in which I shall show that its peculiar\r\ncharacter contributed largely to their success, not only in reducing\r\nall Italy to their authority, and in acquiring a supremacy over the\r\nIberians and Gauls besides, but also at last, after their conquest of\r\nCarthage, to their conceiving the idea of universal dominion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second on Hiero of Syracuse.]\r\n\r\nAlong with this I shall introduce another digression on the fall of\r\nHiero of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5. The attempted partition of the dominions of Ptolemy\r\nEpiphanes, B.C. 204.]\r\n\r\nAfter these digressions will come the disturbances in Egypt; how, after\r\nthe death of King Ptolemy, Antiochus and Philip entered into a compact\r\nfor the partition of the dominions of that monarch’s infant son. I\r\nshall describe their treacherous dealings, Philip laying hands upon the\r\nislands of the Aegean, and Caria and Samos, Antiochus upon Coele-Syria\r\nand Phoenicia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 6. War with Philip, B.C. 201-197.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ Next, after a summary recapitulation of the proceedings of the\r\nCarthaginians and Romans in Iberia, Libya, and Sicily, I shall,\r\nfollowing the changes of events, shift the scene of my story entirely\r\nto Greece. Here I shall first describe the naval battles of Attalus and\r\nthe Rhodians against Philip; and the war between Philip and Rome, the\r\npersons engaged, its circumstances, and result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 7. Asiatic war, B.C. 192-191.]\r\n\r\nNext to this I shall have to record the wrath of the Aetolians, in\r\nconsequence of which they invited the aid of Antiochus, and thereby\r\ngave rise to what is called the Asiatic war against Rome and the\r\nAchaean league. Having stated the causes of this war, and described\r\nthe crossing of Antiochus into Europe, I shall have to show first in\r\nwhat manner he was driven from Greece; secondly, how, being defeated in\r\nthe war, he was forced to cede all his territory west of Taurus; and\r\nthirdly, how the Romans, after crushing the insolence of the Gauls,\r\nsecured undisputed possession of Asia, and freed all the nations on\r\nthe west of Taurus from the fear of barbarian inroads and the lawless\r\nviolence of the Gauls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 8. Gallic wars of Eumenes and Prusias.]\r\n\r\nNext, after reviewing the disasters of the Aetolians and Cephallenians,\r\nI shall pass to the wars waged by Eumenes against Prusias and the\r\nGauls; as well as that carried on in alliance with Ariarathes against\r\nPharnaces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 9. Union of the Peloponnese. Antiochus Epiphanes in Egypt.\r\nFall of the Macedonian monarchy, B.C. 188-168.]\r\n\r\nFinally, after speaking of the unity and settlement of the Peloponnese,\r\nand of the growth of the commonwealth of Rhodes, I shall add a summary\r\nof my whole work, concluding by an account of the expedition of\r\nAntiochus Epiphanes against Egypt; of the war against Perseus; and the\r\ndestruction of the Macedonian monarchy. Throughout the whole narrative\r\nit will be shown how the policy adopted by the Romans in one after\r\nanother of these cases, as they arose, led to their eventual conquest\r\nof the whole world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plan extended to embrace the period from B.C. 168-146.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ And if our judgment of individuals and constitutions, for praise\r\nor blame, could be adequately formed from a simple consideration of\r\ntheir successes or defeats, I must necessarily have stopped at this\r\npoint, and have concluded my history as soon as I reached these last\r\nevents in accordance with my original plan. For at this point the\r\nfifty-three years were coming to an end, and the progress of the Roman\r\npower had arrived at its consummation. And, besides, by this time the\r\nacknowledgment had been extorted from all that the supremacy of Rome\r\nmust be accepted, and her commands obeyed. But in truth, judgments of\r\neither side founded on the bare facts of success or failure in the\r\nfield are by no means final. It has often happened that what seemed\r\nthe most signal successes have, from ill management, brought the\r\nmost crushing disasters in their train; while not unfrequently the\r\nmost terrible calamities, sustained with spirit, have been turned to\r\nactual advantage. I am bound, therefore, to add to my statement of\r\nfacts a discussion on the subsequent policy of the conquerors, and\r\ntheir administration of their universal dominion: and again on the\r\nvarious feelings and opinions entertained by other nations towards\r\ntheir rulers. And I must also describe the tastes and aims of the\r\nseveral nations, whether in their private lives or public policy. The\r\npresent generation will learn from this whether they should shun or\r\nseek the rule of Rome; and future generations will be taught whether\r\nto praise and imitate, or to decry it. The usefulness of my history,\r\nwhether for the present or the future, will mainly lie in this. For\r\nthe end of a policy should not be, in the eyes either of the actors\r\nor their historians, simply to conquer others and bring all into\r\nsubjection. Nor does any man of sense go to war with his neighbours\r\nfor the mere purpose of mastering his opponents; nor go to sea for\r\nthe mere sake of the voyage; nor engage in professions and trades for\r\nthe sole purpose of learning them. In all these cases the objects are\r\ninvariably the pleasure, honour, or profit which are the results of\r\nthe several employments. Accordingly the object of this work shall\r\nbe to ascertain exactly what the position of the several states was,\r\nafter the universal conquest by which they fell under the power of\r\nRome, until the commotions and disturbances which broke out at a later\r\nperiod. These I designed to make the starting-point of what may almost\r\nbe called a new work, partly because of the greatness and surprising\r\nnature of the events themselves, but chiefly because, in the case of\r\nmost of them, I was not only an eye-witness, but in some cases one of\r\nthe actors, and in others the chief director.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new departure; the breaking-up of the arrangement made\r\nafter the fall of Macedonia. Wars of Carthage against Massinissa; and\r\nof Rome against the Celtiberians, B.C. 155-150; and against Carthage\r\n(3d Punic war, B.C. 149-146).]\r\n\r\n+5.+ The events I refer to are the wars of Rome against the\r\nCeltiberians and Vaccaei; those of Carthage against Massinissa, king of\r\nLibya; and those of Attalus and Prusias in Asia. Then also Ariarathes,\r\nKing of Cappadocia, having been ejected from his throne by Orophernes\r\nthrough the agency of King Demetrius, recovered his ancestral power by\r\nthe help of Attalus; while Demetrius, son of Seleucus, after twelve\r\nyears' possession of the throne of Syria, was deprived of it, and of\r\nhis life at the same time, by a combination of the other kings against\r\nhim. Then it was, too, that the Romans restored to their country those\r\nGreeks who had been charged with guilt in the matter of the war with\r\nPerseus, after formally acquitting them of the crimes alleged against\r\nthem. Not long afterwards the same people turned their hands against\r\nCarthage: at first with the intention of forcing its removal to some\r\nother spot, but finally, for reasons to be afterwards stated, with the\r\nresolution of utterly destroying it. Contemporaneous with this came the\r\nrenunciation by the Macedonians of their friendship to Rome, and by the\r\nLacedaemonians of their membership of the Achaean league, to which the\r\ndisaster that befell all Greece alike owed its beginning and end.\r\n\r\nThis is my purpose: but its fulfilment must depend upon whether Fortune\r\nprotracts my life to the necessary length. I am persuaded, however,\r\nthat, even if the common human destiny does overtake me, this theme\r\nwill not be allowed to lie idle for want of competent men to handle\r\nit; for there are many besides myself who will readily undertake its\r\ncompletion. But having given the heads of the most remarkable events,\r\nwith the object of enabling the reader to grasp the general scope of my\r\nhistory as well as the arrangement of its several parts, I must now,\r\nremembering my original plan, go back to the point at which my history\r\nstarts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the 2d Punic war;]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 334,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 192,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 401-400,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 396-394,]\r\n\r\n+6.+ Some historians of the Hannibalian war, when they wish to point\r\nout to us the causes of this contest between Rome and Carthage, allege\r\nfirst the siege of Saguntum by the Carthaginians, and, secondly,\r\ntheir breach of treaty by crossing the river called by the natives\r\nthe Iber. But though I should call these the first actions in the\r\nwar, I cannot admit them to be its causes. One might just as well say\r\nthat the crossing of Alexander the Great into Asia was the _cause_\r\nof the Persian war, and the descent of Antiochus upon Demetrias the\r\n_cause_ of his war with Rome. In neither would it be a probable or true\r\nstatement. In the first case, this action of Alexander’s could not be\r\ncalled the cause of a war, for which both he and his father Philip in\r\nhis lifetime had made elaborate preparations: and in the second case,\r\nwe know that the Aetolian league had done the same, with a view to a\r\nwar with Rome, before Antiochus came upon the scene. Such definitions\r\nare only worthy of men who cannot distinguish between a first overt\r\nact and a cause or pretext; and who do not perceive that a _cause_\r\nis the first in a series of events of which such an overt act is the\r\nlast. I shall therefore regard the first attempt to put into execution\r\nwhat had already been determined as a “beginning,” but I shall look\r\nfor “causes” in the motives which suggested such action and the policy\r\nwhich dictated it; for it is by these, and the calculations to which\r\nthey give rise, that men are led to decide upon a particular line of\r\nconduct. The soundness of this method will be proved by the following\r\nconsiderations. The true causes and origin of the invasion of Persia\r\nby Alexander are patent to everybody. They were, first, the return\r\nmarch of the Greeks under Xenophon through the country from the upper\r\nSatrapies; in the course of which, though throughout Asia all the\r\npopulations were hostile, not a single barbarian ventured to face them:\r\nsecondly, the invasion of Asia by the Spartan king Agesilaus, in which,\r\nthough he was obliged by troubles in Greece to return in the middle of\r\nhis expedition without effecting his object, he yet found no resistance\r\nof any importance or adequacy. It was these circumstances which\r\nconvinced Philip of the cowardice and inefficiency of the Persians; and\r\ncomparing them with his own high state of efficiency for war, and that\r\nof his Macedonian subjects, and placing before his eyes the splendour\r\nof the rewards to be gained by such a war, and the popularity which it\r\nwould bring him in Greece, he seized on the pretext of avenging the\r\ninjuries done by Persia to Greece, and determined with great eagerness\r\nto undertake this war; and was in fact at the time of his death engaged\r\nin making every kind of preparation for it.\r\n\r\nHere we have the _cause_ and the _pretext_ of the Persian war.\r\nAlexander’s expedition into Asia was the _first action_ in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and of the war with Antiochus.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ So too of the war of Antiochus with Rome. The _cause_ was\r\nevidently the exasperation of the Aetolians, who, thinking that they\r\nhad been slighted in a number of instances at the end of the war with\r\nPhilip, not only called in the aid of Antiochus, but resolved to go to\r\nevery extremity in satisfying the anger which the events of that time\r\nhad aroused in them. This was the _cause_. As for the _pretext_, it\r\nwas the liberation of Greece, which they went from city to city with\r\nAntiochus proclaiming, without regard to reason or truth; while the\r\n_first act_ in the war was the descent of Antiochus upon Demetrias.\r\n\r\nMy object in enlarging upon this distinction is not to attack the\r\nhistorians in question, but to rectify the ideas of the studious. A\r\nphysician can do no good to the sick who does not know the causes\r\nof their ailments; nor can a statesman do any good who is unable to\r\nconceive the manner, cause, and source of the events with which he has\r\nfrom time to time to deal. Surely the former could not be expected to\r\ninstitute a suitable system of treatment for the body; nor the latter\r\nto grapple with the exigencies of the situation, without possessing\r\nthis knowledge of its elements. There is nothing, therefore, which we\r\nought to be more alive to, and to seek for, than the causes of every\r\nevent which occurs. For the most important results are often produced\r\nby trifles; and it is invariably easier to apply remedial measures at\r\nthe beginning, before things have got beyond the stage of conception\r\nand intention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The credibility of Fabius Pictor.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ Now the Roman annalist Fabius asserts that the cause of the\r\nHannibalian war, besides the injury inflicted upon Saguntum, was the\r\nencroaching and ambitious spirit of Hasdrubal. “Having secured great\r\npower in Iberia, he returned to Libya with the design of destroying\r\nthe constitution and reducing Carthage to a despotism. But the leading\r\nstatesmen, getting timely warning of his intention, banded themselves\r\ntogether and successfully opposed him. Suspecting this Hasdrubal\r\nretired from Libya, and thenceforth governed Iberia entirely at his own\r\nwill without taking any account whatever of the Carthaginian Senate.\r\nThis policy had had in Hannibal from his earliest youth a zealous\r\nsupporter and imitator; and when he succeeded to the command in Iberia\r\nhe continued it: and accordingly, even in the case of this war with\r\nRome, was acting on his own authority and contrary to the wish of the\r\nCarthaginians; for none of the men of note in Carthage approved of\r\nhis attack upon Saguntum.” This is the statement of Fabius, who goes\r\non to say, that “after the capture of that city an embassy arrived in\r\nCarthage from Rome demanding that Hannibal should be given up on pain\r\nof a declaration of war.”\r\n\r\nNow what answer could Fabius have given if we had put the following\r\nquestion to him? “What better chance or opportunity could the\r\nCarthaginians have had of combining justice and interest? According to\r\nyour own account they disliked the proceeding of Hannibal: why did they\r\nnot submit to the demands of Rome by surrendering the author of the\r\ninjury; and thus get rid of the common enemy of the state without the\r\nodium of doing it themselves, and secure the safety of their territory\r\nby ridding themselves of the threatened war—all of which they could\r\nhave effected by merely passing a decree?” If this question were put,\r\nI say, it would admit of no answer. The fact is that, so far from\r\ndoing anything of the sort, they maintained the war in accordance with\r\nHannibal’s policy for seventeen years; and refused to make terms until,\r\nat the end of a most determined struggle, they found their own city and\r\npersons in imminent danger of destruction.\r\n\r\n+9.+ I do not allude to Fabius and his annals from any fear of their\r\nwearing such an air of probability in themselves as to gain any\r\ncredit,—for the fact is that his assertions are so contrary to reason,\r\nthat it does not need any argument of mine to help his readers to\r\nperceive it,—but I wished to warn those who take up his books not to\r\nbe misled by the authority of his name, but to be guided by facts.\r\nFor there is a certain class of readers in whose eyes the personality\r\nof the writer is of more account than what he says. They look to the\r\nfact that Fabius was a contemporary and a member of the Senate, and\r\nassume without more ado that everything he says may be trusted. My\r\nview, however, is that we ought not to hold the authority of this\r\nwriter lightly: yet at the same time that we should not regard it as\r\nall-sufficient; but in reading his writings should test them by a\r\nreference to the facts themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hannibalian or 2nd Punic war. First cause.]\r\n\r\nThis is a digression from my immediate subject, which is the war\r\nbetween Carthage and Rome. The cause of this war we must reckon to be\r\nthe exasperation of Hamilcar, surnamed Barcas, the father of Hannibal.\r\nThe result of the war in Sicily had not broken the spirit of that\r\ncommander. He regarded himself as unconquered; for the troops at\r\nEryx which he commanded were still sound and undismayed: and though\r\nhe yielded so far as to make a treaty, it was a concession to the\r\nexigencies of the times brought on by the defeat of the Carthaginians\r\nat sea. But he never relaxed in his determined purpose of revenge; and,\r\nhad it not been for the mutiny of the mercenaries at Carthage, he would\r\nat once have sought and made another occasion for bringing about a war,\r\nas far as he was able to do so: as it was, he was preoccupied by the\r\ndomestic war, and had to give his attention entirely to that.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238. Bk. i. ch. 88. Second cause.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third cause.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ When the Romans, at the conclusion of this mercenary war,\r\nproclaimed war with Carthage, the latter at first was inclined to\r\nresist at all hazards, because the goodness of her cause gave her\r\nhopes of victory,—as I have shown in my former book, without which\r\nit would be impossible to understand adequately either this or what\r\nis to follow. The Romans, however, would not listen to anything: and\r\nthe Carthaginians therefore yielded to the force of circumstances;\r\nand though feeling bitterly aggrieved, yet being quite unable to do\r\nanything, evacuated Sardinia, and consented to pay a sum of twelve\r\nhundred talents, in addition to the former indemnity paid them, on\r\ncondition of avoiding the war at that time. This is the second and\r\nthe most important cause of the subsequent war. For Hamilcar, having\r\nthis public grievance in addition to his private feelings of anger, as\r\nsoon as he had secured his country’s safety by reducing the rebellious\r\nmercenaries, set at once about securing the Carthaginian power in\r\nIberia with the intention of using it as a base of operations against\r\nRome. So that I record as a third cause of the war the Carthaginian\r\nsuccess in Iberia: for it was the confidence inspired by their forces\r\nthere which encouraged them to embark upon it. It would be easy to\r\nadduce other facts to show that Hamilcar, though he had been dead ten\r\nyears at its commencement, largely contributed to bring about the\r\nsecond Punic war, but what I am about to say will be sufficient to\r\nestablish the fact.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s oath.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ When, after his final defeat by the Romans, Hannibal had at last\r\nquitted his country and was staying at the court of Antiochus, the\r\nwarlike attitude of the Aetolian league induced the Romans to send\r\nambassadors to Antiochus, that they might be informed of the king’s\r\nintentions. These ambassadors found that Antiochus was inclined to the\r\nAetolian alliance, and was eager for war with Rome; they accordingly\r\npaid great court to Hannibal with a view of bringing him into suspicion\r\nwith the king. And in this they entirely succeeded. As time went on the\r\nking became ever more and more suspicious of Hannibal, until at length\r\nan opportunity occurred for an explanation of the alienation that had\r\nbeen thus secretly growing up between them. Hannibal then defended\r\nhimself at great length, but without success, until at last he made the\r\nfollowing statement: “When my father was about to go on his Iberian\r\nexpedition I was nine years old: and as he was offering the sacrifice\r\nto Zeus I stood near the altar. The sacrifice successfully performed,\r\nmy father poured the libation and went through the usual ritual. He\r\nthen bade all the other worshippers stand a little back, and calling\r\nme to him asked me affectionately whether I wished to go with him on\r\nhis expedition. Upon my eagerly assenting, and begging with boyish\r\nenthusiasm to be allowed to go, he took me by the right hand and led me\r\nup to the altar, and bade me lay my hand upon the victim and swear that\r\nI would never be friends with Rome. So long, then, Antiochus, as your\r\npolicy is one of hostility to Rome, you may feel quite secure of having\r\nin me a most thorough-going supporter. But if ever you make terms or\r\nfriendship with her, then you need not wait for any slander to make you\r\ndistrust me and be on your guard against me; for there is nothing in my\r\npower that I would not do against her.”\r\n\r\n+12.+ Antiochus listened to this story, and being convinced that\r\nit was told with genuine feeling and sincerity, gave up all his\r\nsuspicions. And we, too, must regard this as an unquestionable proof\r\nof the animosity of Hamilcar and of the aim of his general policy;\r\nwhich, indeed, is also proved by facts. For he inspired his son-in-law\r\nHasdrubal and his son Hannibal with a bitterness of resentment against\r\nRome which nothing could surpass. Hasdrubal, indeed, was prevented\r\nby death from showing the full extent of his purpose; but time gave\r\nHannibal abundant opportunity to manifest the hatred of Rome which he\r\nhad inherited from his father.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing, then, for statesmen to observe is the\r\nmotives of those who lay aside old enmities or form new friendships;\r\nand to ascertain when their consent to treaties is a mere concession\r\nto the necessities of the hour, and when it is the indication of a\r\nreal consciousness of defeat. In the former case they must be on their\r\nguard against such people lying in wait for an opportunity; while\r\nin the latter they may unhesitatingly impose whatever injunctions\r\nare necessary, in full reliance on the genuineness of their feelings\r\nwhether as subjects or friends. So much for the causes of the war. I\r\nwill now relate the first actions in it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hamilcar, B.C. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Hasdrubal, B.C. 221.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ The Carthaginians were highly incensed by their loss of Sicily,\r\nbut their resentment was heightened still more, as I have said, by\r\nthe transaction as to Sardinia, and by the addition recently made to\r\ntheir tribute. Accordingly, when the greater part of Iberia had fallen\r\ninto their power, they were on the alert to seize any opportunity that\r\npresented itself of retaliating upon Rome. At the death of Hasdrubal,\r\nto whom they had committed the command in Iberia after the death of\r\nHamilcar, they waited at first to ascertain the feelings of the army;\r\nbut when news came from thence that the troops had elected Hannibal as\r\ncommander-in-chief, a popular assembly was at once held, and the choice\r\nof the army confirmed by a unanimous vote. As soon as he had taken over\r\nthe command, Hannibal set out to subdue the tribe of the Olcades; and,\r\nhaving arrived before their most formidable city Althaea, he pitched\r\nhis camp under its walls; and by a series of energetic and formidable\r\nassaults succeeded before long in taking it: by which the rest of\r\nthe tribe were overawed into submission to Carthage. Having imposed\r\na contribution upon the towns, and thus become possessed of a large\r\nsum of money, he went to the New Town to winter. There, by a liberal\r\ntreatment of the forces under his command, giving them an instalment of\r\ntheir pay at once and promising the rest, he established an excellent\r\nfeeling towards himself in the army, as well as great hopes for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220. Hannibal attacks the Vaccaei.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ Next summer he set out on another expedition against the Vaccaei,\r\nin which he took Salmantica by assault, but only succeeded in storming\r\nArbucala, owing to the size of the town and the number and valour of\r\nits inhabitants, after a laborious siege. After this he suddenly found\r\nhimself in a position of very great danger on his return march: being\r\nset upon by the Carpesii, the strongest tribe in those parts, who were\r\njoined also by neighbouring tribes, incited principally by refugees\r\nof the Olcades, but roused also to great wrath by those who escaped\r\nfrom Salmantica. If the Carthaginians had been compelled to give these\r\npeople regular battle, there can be no doubt that they would have been\r\ndefeated: but as it was, Hannibal, with admirable skill and caution,\r\nslowly retreated until he had put the Tagus between himself and the\r\nenemy; and thus giving battle at the crossing of the stream, supported\r\nby it and the elephants, of which he had about forty, he gained, to\r\nevery one’s surprise, a complete success. For when the barbarians\r\nattempted to force a crossing at several points of the river at once,\r\nthe greater number of them were killed as they left the water by the\r\nelephants, who marched up and down along the brink of the river and\r\ncaught them as they were coming out. Many of them also were killed\r\nin the river itself by the cavalry, because the horses were better\r\nable than the men to stand against the stream, and also because the\r\ncavalry were fighting on higher ground than the infantry which they\r\nwere attacking. At length Hannibal turned the tables on the enemy, and,\r\nrecrossing the river, attacked and put to flight their whole army, to\r\nthe number of more than a hundred thousand men. After the defeat of\r\nthis host, no one south of the Iber rashly ventured to face him except\r\nthe people of Saguntum. From that town Hannibal tried his best to keep\r\naloof; because, acting on the suggestions and advice of his father\r\nHamilcar, he did not wish to give the Romans an avowed pretext for war\r\nuntil he had thoroughly secured the rest of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Saguntum appeals to Rome. Winter of B.C. 220-219.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s defiance.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ But the people of Saguntum kept sending ambassadors to Rome,\r\npartly because they foresaw what was coming, and trembled for their\r\nown existence, and partly that the Romans might be kept fully aware\r\nof the growing power of the Carthaginians in Iberia. For a long\r\ntime the Romans disregarded their words: but now they sent out some\r\ncommissioners to see what was going on. Just at that time Hannibal had\r\nfinished the conquests which he intended for that season, and was going\r\ninto winter quarters at the New Town again, which was in a way the\r\nchief glory and capital town of the Carthaginians in Iberia. He found\r\nthere the embassy from Rome, granted them an interview, and listened to\r\nthe message with which they were charged. It was a strong injunction\r\nto him to leave Saguntum alone, as being under the protection of Rome;\r\nand not to cross the Iber, in accordance with the agreement come to\r\nin the time of Hasdrubal. To this Hannibal answered with all the\r\nheat of youth, inflamed by martial ardour, recent success, and his\r\nlong-standing hatred of Rome. He charged the Romans with having a short\r\ntime before, when on some political disturbances arising in the town\r\nthey had been chosen to act as arbitrators, seized the opportunity to\r\nput some of the leading citizens to death; and he declared that the\r\nCarthaginians would not allow the Saguntines to be thus treacherously\r\ndealt with, for it was the traditional policy of Carthage to protect\r\nall persons so wronged. At the same time he sent home for instructions\r\nas to what he was to do “in view of the fact that the Saguntines were\r\ninjuring certain of their subject allies.” And altogether he was in a\r\nstate of unreasoning anger and violent exasperation, which prevented\r\nhim from availing himself of the real causes for war, and made him\r\ntake refuge in pretexts which would not admit of justification, after\r\nthe manner of men whose passions master all considerations of equity.\r\nHow much better it would have been to demand of Rome the restoration\r\nof Sardinia, and the remission of the tribute, which she had taken an\r\nunfair opportunity to impose on pain of a declaration of war. As it\r\nwas, he said not a word of the real cause, but alleged the fictitious\r\none of the matter of Saguntum; and so got the credit of beginning the\r\nwar, not only in defiance of reason, but still more in defiance of\r\njustice. The Roman ambassadors, finding that there must undoubtedly be\r\na war, sailed to Carthage to enter the same protest before the people\r\nthere. They expected, however, that they would have to fight not in\r\nItaly, but in Iberia, and that they would have Saguntum as a base of\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illyrian war, B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 219. Coss. M. Livius Salinator L. Aemilius Paullus.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ Wherefore the Senate, by way of preparing to undertake this\r\nbusiness, and foreseeing that the war would be severe and protracted,\r\nand at a long distance from the mother country, determined to make\r\nIllyria safe. For it happened that, just at this time, Demetrius\r\nof Pharos was sacking and subduing to his authority the cities of\r\nIllyria which were subject to Rome, and had sailed beyond Lissus, in\r\nviolation of the treaty, with fifty galleys, and had ravaged many of\r\nthe Cyclades. For he had quite forgotten the former kindnesses done\r\nhim by Rome, and had conceived a contempt for its power, when he saw\r\nit threatened first by the Gauls and then by Carthage; and he now\r\nrested all his hopes on the royal family of Macedonia, because he had\r\nfought on the side of Antigonus, and shared with him the dangers of the\r\nwar against Cleomenes. These transactions attracted the observation\r\nof the Romans; who, seeing that the royal house of Macedonia was in\r\na flourishing condition, were very anxious to secure the country\r\neast of Italy, feeling convinced that they would have ample time to\r\ncorrect the rash folly of the Illyrians, and rebuke and chastise the\r\ningratitude and temerity of Demetrius. But they were deceived in their\r\ncalculations. For Hannibal anticipated their measures by the capture\r\nof Saguntum: the result of which was that the war took place not in\r\nIberia, but close to Rome itself, and in various parts throughout all\r\nItaly. However, with these ideas fixed in their minds, the Romans\r\ndespatched Lucius Aemilius just before summer to conduct the Illyrian\r\ncampaign in the first year of the 140th Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal besieges Saguntum.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ But Hannibal had started from New Carthage and was leading\r\nhis army straight against Saguntum. This city is situated on the\r\nseaward foot of the mountain chain on which the frontiers of Iberia\r\nand Celtiberia converge, and is about seven stades from the sea. The\r\ndistrict cultivated by its inhabitants is exceedingly productive, and\r\nhas a soil superior to any in all Iberia. Under the walls of this\r\ntown Hannibal pitched his camp and set energetically to work on the\r\nsiege, foreseeing many advantages that would accrue if he could take\r\nit. Of these the first was that he would thereby disappoint the Romans\r\nin their expectation of making Iberia the seat of war: a second was\r\nthat he would thereby strike a general terror, which would render the\r\nalready obedient tribes more submissive, and the still independent\r\nones more cautious of offending him: but the greatest advantage of\r\nall was that thereby he would be able to push on his advance, without\r\nleaving an enemy on his rear. Besides these advantages, he calculated\r\nthat the possession of this city would secure him abundant supplies\r\nfor his expedition, and create an enthusiasm in the troops excited\r\nby individual acquisitions of booty; while he would conciliate the\r\ngoodwill of those who remained at Carthage by the spoils which would\r\nbe sent home. With these ideas he pressed on the siege with energy:\r\nsometimes setting an example to his soldiers by personally sharing in\r\nthe fatigues of throwing up the siege works; and sometimes cheering on\r\nhis men and recklessly exposing himself to danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Saguntum.]\r\n\r\nAfter a siege extending to the eighth month, in the course of which\r\nhe endured every kind of suffering and anxiety, he finally succeeded\r\nin taking the town. An immense booty in money, slaves, and property\r\nfell into his hands, which he disposed of in accordance with his\r\noriginal design. The money he reserved for the needs of his projected\r\nexpedition; the slaves were distributed according to merit among his\r\nmen; while the property was at once sent entire to Carthage. The result\r\nanswered his expectations: the army was rendered more eager for action;\r\nthe home populace more ready to grant whatever he asked; and he himself\r\nwas enabled, by the possession of such abundant means, to carry out\r\nmany measures that were of service to his expedition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illyrian war, B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n+18.+ While this was taking place, Demetrius, discovering the\r\nintentions of Rome, threw a sufficient garrison into Dimale and\r\nvictualled it in proportion. In the other towns he put those who were\r\nopposed to him to death, and placed the chief power in the hands of\r\nhis own partisans; and selecting six thousand of the bravest of his\r\nsubjects, quartered them in Pharos. When the Consul arrived in Illyria\r\nwith his army, he found the enemies of Rome confident in the strength\r\nof Dimale and the elaborate preparations in it, and encouraged to\r\nresistance by their belief in its impregnability; he determined,\r\ntherefore, to attack that town first, in order to strike terror into\r\nthe enemy. Accordingly, after addressing an exhortation to the several\r\nofficers of the legions, and throwing up siege works at several points,\r\nhe began the siege in form. In seven days he took the town by assault,\r\nwhich so dismayed the enemy, that envoys immediately appeared from all\r\nthe towns, surrendering themselves unconditionally to the protection\r\nof Rome. The Consul accepted their submission: and after imposing\r\nsuch conditions as appeared suitable to the several cases, he sailed\r\nto Pharos to attack Demetrius himself. Being informed that the city\r\nthere was strongly fortified, thronged with excellent soldiers, and\r\nwell-furnished with provisions and all other munitions of war, he began\r\nto entertain misgivings that the siege would be long and difficult; and\r\ntherefore, with a view to these difficulties, he adopted on the spur of\r\nthe moment the following strategem. He crossed to the island by night\r\nwith his whole army. The greater part of it he disembarked at a spot\r\nwhere the ground was well-wooded and low; while with only twenty ships\r\nhe sailed at daybreak to the harbour nearest the town. The smallness\r\nof the number of the ships moved only the contempt of Demetrius when\r\nhe saw them, and he immediately marched out of the town down to the\r\nharbour to oppose the landing of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Pharos.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ A violent struggle at once began: and, as it went on, division\r\nafter division of the troops in the city came down to support him,\r\nuntil at length the whole force had poured out to take part in the\r\nengagement. The Romans who had landed in the night arrived at the\r\ncritical moment, after a march by an obscure route; and seizing a\r\nstrong position on some rising ground between the city and the harbour,\r\nefficiently cut off from the city the troops that had sallied out.\r\nWhen Demetrius became aware of what had taken place, he desisted from\r\nopposing the disembarkation; and having rallied his men and addressed\r\nthe ranks, he put them in motion, with the resolution of fighting a\r\npitched battle with the troops on the hill. When the Romans saw the\r\nIllyrian advance being made in good order and with great spirit, they\r\nformed their ranks and charged furiously. At the same moment the Roman\r\ntroops which had just effected their landing, seeing what was going on,\r\ncharged the enemy on the rear, who being thus attacked on both sides,\r\nwere thrown into great disorder and confusion. The result was that,\r\nfinding both his van and his rear in difficulties, Demetrius fled.\r\nSome of his men retreated towards the city; but most of them escaped\r\nby bye-paths into various parts of the island. Demetrius himself made\r\nhis way to some galleys which he kept at anchor at a solitary point\r\non the coast, with a view to every contingency; and going on board,\r\nhe sailed away at nightfall, and arrived unexpectedly at the court of\r\nKing Philip, where he passed the remainder of his life:—a man whose\r\nundoubted boldness and courage were unsupported by either prudence or\r\njudgment. His end was of a piece with the whole tenor of his life; for\r\nwhile endeavouring at the instigation of Philip to seize Messene, he\r\nexposed himself during the battle with a careless rashness which cost\r\nhim his life; of which I shall speak in detail when I come to that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Consul Aemilius having thus taken Pharos at a blow, levelled the\r\ncity to the ground; and then having become master of all Illyria, and\r\nhaving ordered all its affairs as he thought right, returned towards\r\nthe end of the summer to Rome, where he celebrated a triumph amid\r\nexpressions of unmixed approval; for people considered that he had\r\nmanaged this business with great prudence and even greater courage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indignation at Rome at the fall of Saguntum.]\r\n\r\n+20.+ But when news came to Rome of the fall of Saguntum, there was\r\nindeed no debate on the question of war, as some historians assert; who\r\neven add the speeches delivered on either side. But nothing could be\r\nmore ridiculous. For is it conceivable that the Romans should have a\r\nyear before proclaimed war with the Carthaginians in the event of their\r\nentering the territory of Saguntum, and yet, when the city itself had\r\nbeen taken, should have debated whether they should go to war or no?\r\nJust as absurd are the wonderful statements that the senators put on\r\nmourning, and that the fathers introduced their sons above twelve years\r\nold into the Senate House, who, being admitted to the debate, refrained\r\nfrom divulging any of its secrets even to their nearest relations. All\r\nthis is as improbable as it is untrue; unless we are to believe that\r\nFortune, among its other bounties, granted the Romans the privilege of\r\nbeing men of the world from their cradles. I need not waste any more\r\nwords upon such compositions as those of Chaereas and Sosilus;[165]\r\nwhich, in my judgment, are more like the gossip of the barber’s shop\r\nand the pavement than history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Envoys sent to Carthage to demand surrender of Hannibal.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that, when the Romans heard of the disaster at Saguntum,\r\nthey at once elected envoys, whom they despatched in all haste to\r\nCarthage with the offer of two alternatives, one of which appeared\r\nto the Carthaginians to involve disgrace as well as injury if they\r\naccepted it, while the other was the beginning of a great struggle\r\nand of great dangers. For one of these alternatives was the surrender\r\nof Hannibal and his staff to Rome, the other was war. When the Roman\r\nenvoys arrived and declared their message to the Senate, the choice\r\nproposed to them between these alternatives was listened to by the\r\nCarthaginians with indignation. Still they selected the most capable of\r\ntheir number to state their case, which was grounded on the following\r\npleas.\r\n\r\n+21.+ Passing over the treaty made with Hasdrubal, as not having ever\r\nbeen made, and, if it had, as not being binding on them because made\r\nwithout their consent (and on this point they quoted the precedent of\r\nthe Romans themselves, who in the Sicilian war repudiated the terms\r\nagreed upon and accepted by Lutatius, as having been made without\r\ntheir consent)—passing over this, they pressed with all the vehemence\r\nthey could, throughout the discussion, the last treaty made in the\r\nSicilian war; in which they affirmed that there was no clause relating\r\nto Iberia, but one expressly providing security for the allies of both\r\nparties to the treaty. Now, they pointed out that the Saguntines at\r\nthat time were not allies of Rome, and therefore were not protected\r\nby the clause. To prove their point, they read the treaty more than\r\nonce aloud. On this occasion the Roman envoys contented themselves\r\nwith the reply that, while Saguntum was intact, the matter in\r\ndispute admitted of pleadings and of a discussion on its merits; but\r\nthat, that city having been treacherously seized, they had only two\r\nalternatives,—either to deliver the persons guilty of the act, and\r\nthereby make it clear that they had no share in their crime, and that\r\nit was done without their consent; or, if they were not willing to do\r\nthat, and avowed their complicity in it, to take the consequences.\r\n\r\nThe question of treaties between Rome and Carthage was referred\r\nto in general terms in the course of this debate: but I think a\r\nmore particular examination of it will be useful both to practical\r\nstatesmen, who require to know the exact truth of the matter, in order\r\nto avoid mistakes in any critical deliberation; and to historical\r\nstudents, that they may not be led astray by the ignorance or partisan\r\nbias of historians; but may have before them a conspectus, acknowledged\r\nto be accurate, of the various compacts which have been made between\r\nRome and Carthage from the earliest times to our own day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treaties between Rome and Carthage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first treaty, B.C. 509-508.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ The first treaty between Rome and Carthage was made in the\r\nyear of Lucius Junius Brutus and Marcus Horatius, the first Consuls\r\nappointed after the expulsion of the kings, by which men also the\r\ntemple of Jupiter Capitolinus was consecrated. This was twenty-eight\r\nyears before the invasion of Greece by Xerxes. Of this treaty I append\r\na translation, as accurate as I could make it,—for the fact is that\r\nthe ancient language differs so much from that at present in use, that\r\nthe best scholars among the Romans themselves have great difficulty in\r\ninterpreting some points in it, even after much study. The treaty is as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n“There shall be friendship between the Romans and their allies, and the\r\nCarthaginians and their allies, on these conditions:\r\n\r\n“Neither the Romans nor their allies are to sail beyond the Fair\r\nPromontory, unless driven by stress of weather or the fear of enemies.\r\nIf any one of them be driven ashore he shall not buy or take aught for\r\nhimself save what is needful for the repair of his ship and the service\r\nof the gods, and he shall depart within five days.\r\n\r\n“Men landing for traffic shall strike no bargain save in the presence\r\nof a herald or town-clerk. Whatever is sold in the presence of these,\r\nlet the price be secured to the seller on the credit of the state—that\r\nis to say, if such sale be in Libya or Sardinia.\r\n\r\n“If any Roman comes to the Carthaginian province in Sicily he shall\r\nenjoy all rights enjoyed by others. The Carthaginians shall do no\r\ninjury to the people of Ardea, Antium, Laurentium, Circeii, Tarracina,\r\nnor any other people of the Latins that are subject to Rome.\r\n\r\n“From those townships even which are not subject to Rome[166] they\r\nshall hold their hands; and if they take one shall deliver it unharmed\r\nto the Romans. They shall build no fort in Latium; and if they enter\r\nthe district in arms, they shall not stay a night therein.”\r\n\r\n+23.+ The “Fair Promontory” here referred to is that which lies\r\nimmediately to the north of Carthage; south of which the Carthaginians\r\nstipulated that the Romans should not sail with ships of war, because,\r\nas I imagine, they did not wish them to be acquainted with the coast\r\nnear Byzacium, or the lesser Syrtis, which places they call Emporia,\r\nowing to the productiveness of the district. The treaty then goes on\r\nto say that, if any one of them is driven thither by stress of weather\r\nor fear of an enemy, and stands in need of anything for the worship of\r\nthe gods and the repair of his vessel, this and no more he may take;\r\nand all those who have come to anchor there must necessarily depart\r\nwithin five days. To Carthage, and all the country on the Carthaginian\r\nside of the Fair Promontory in Libya, to Sardinia, and the Carthaginian\r\nprovince of Sicily, the treaty allows the Romans to sail for mercantile\r\npurposes; and the Carthaginians engage their public credit that such\r\npersons shall enjoy absolute security.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this treaty that the Carthaginians speak of Sardinia\r\nand Libya as belonging to them entirely; but, on the other hand, make\r\na distinction in the case of Sicily, and only stipulate for that part\r\nof it which is subject to Carthage. Similarly, the Romans also only\r\nstipulate concerning Latium; the rest of Italy they do not mention, as\r\nnot being under their authority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Second treaty, B.C. 306 (?).]\r\n\r\n+24.+ After this treaty there was a second, in which we find that the\r\nCarthaginians have included the Tyrians and the township of Utica\r\nin addition to their former territory; and to the Fair Promontory\r\nMastia and Tarseium are added, as the points east of which the\r\nRomans are not to make marauding expeditions or found a city. The\r\ntreaty is as follows: “There shall be friendship between the Romans\r\nand their allies, and the Carthaginians, Tyrians, and township of\r\nUtica, on these terms: The Romans shall not maraud, nor traffic, nor\r\nfound a city east of the Fair Promontory, Mastia, Tarseium. If the\r\nCarthaginians take any city in Latium which is not subject to Rome,\r\nthey may keep the prisoners and the goods, but shall deliver up the\r\ntown. If the Carthaginians take any folk, between whom and Rome a peace\r\nhas been made in writing, though they be not subject to them, they\r\nshall not bring them into any harbours of the Romans; if such an one\r\nbe so brought ashore, and any Roman lay claim to him,[167] he shall\r\nbe released. In like manner shall the Romans be bound towards the\r\nCarthaginians.\r\n\r\n“If a Roman take water or provisions from any district within the\r\njurisdiction of Carthage, he shall not injure, while so doing, any\r\nbetween whom and Carthage there is peace and friendship. Neither shall\r\na Carthaginian in like case. If any one shall do so, he shall not\r\nbe punished by private vengeance, but such action shall be a public\r\nmisdemeanour.\r\n\r\n“In Sardinia and Libya no Roman shall traffic nor found a city; he\r\nshall do no more than take in provisions and refit his ship. If a storm\r\ndrive him upon those coasts, he shall depart within five days.\r\n\r\n“In the Carthaginian province of Sicily and in Carthage he may transact\r\nbusiness and sell whatsoever it is lawful for a citizen to do. In like\r\nmanner also may a Carthaginian at Rome.”\r\n\r\nOnce more in this treaty we may notice that the Carthaginians emphasise\r\nthe fact of their entire possession of Libya and Sardinia, and prohibit\r\nany attempt of the Romans to land in them at all; and on the other\r\nhand, in the case of Sicily, they clearly distinguish their own\r\nprovince in it. So, too, the Romans, in regard to Latium, stipulate\r\nthat the Carthaginians shall do no wrong to Ardea, Antium, Circeii,\r\nTarracina, all of which are on the seaboard of Latium, to which alone\r\nthe treaty refers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Third treaty, B.C. 279.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ A third treaty again was made by Rome at the time of the invasion\r\nof Pyrrhus into Sicily, before the Carthaginians undertook the war for\r\nthe possession of Sicily. This treaty contains the same provisions as\r\nthe two earlier treaties with these additional clauses:—\r\n\r\n“If they make a treaty of alliance with Pyrrhus, the Romans or\r\nCarthaginians shall make it on such terms as not to preclude the one\r\ngiving aid to the other, if that one’s territory is attacked.\r\n\r\n“If one or the other stand in need of help, the Carthaginians shall\r\nsupply the ships, whether for transport or war; but each people shall\r\nsupply the pay for its own men employed on them.\r\n\r\n“The Carthaginians shall also give aid by sea to the Romans if need be;\r\nbut no one shall compel the crews to disembark against their will.”\r\n\r\nProvision was also made for swearing to these treaties. In the case\r\nof the first, the Carthaginians were to swear by the gods of their\r\nancestors, the Romans by Jupiter Lapis, in accordance with an ancient\r\ncustom; in the case of the last treaty, by Mars and Quirinus.\r\n\r\nThe form of swearing by Jupiter Lapis was this. The commissioner for\r\nswearing to the treaty took a stone in his hand, and, having taken the\r\noath in the name of his country, added these words, “If I abide by this\r\noath may he bless me; but if I do otherwise in thought or act, may all\r\nothers be kept safe each in his own country, under his own laws, in\r\nenjoyment of his own goods, household gods, and tombs,—may I alone be\r\ncast out, even as this stone is now.” And having uttered these words he\r\nthrows the stone from his hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misstatement of Philinus.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ Seeing that such treaties exist and are preserved to this day,\r\nengraved on brass in the treasury of the Aediles in the temple of\r\nJupiter Capitolinus, the historian Philinus certainly does give us some\r\nreason to be surprised at him. Not at his ignorance of their existence:\r\nfor even in our own day those Romans and Carthaginians, whose age\r\nplaced them nearest to the times, and who had the reputation of taking\r\nthe greatest interest in public affairs, were unaware of it. But what\r\nis surprising is, that he should have ventured on a statement exactly\r\nopposite: “That there was a treaty between Rome and Carthage, in virtue\r\nof which the Romans were bound to keep away from the whole of Sicily,\r\nthe Carthaginians from the whole of Italy; and that the Romans broke\r\nthe treaty and their oath when they first crossed over to Sicily.”\r\nWhereas there does not exist, nor ever has existed, any such written\r\ncompact at all. Yet this assertion he makes in so many words in his\r\nsecond book. I referred to this in the preface of my work, but reserved\r\na more detailed discussion of it to this place; which was necessary,\r\nbecause the assertion of Philinus has misled a considerable number of\r\npeople on this point. I have nothing to say if a man chooses to attack\r\nthe Romans for crossing into Sicily, on the grounds of their having\r\ntaken the Mamertines into alliance at all; or in having thus acted in\r\nanswer to their request, after these men’s treachery to Rhegium as well\r\nas Messene: but if any one supposes that in so crossing they broke\r\noaths or treaties, he is manifestly ignorant of the truth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fourth treaty, B.C. 241.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ At the end of the first Punic war another treaty was made,\r\nof which the chief provisions were these: “The Carthaginians shall\r\nevacuate Sicily and all islands lying between Italy and Sicily.\r\n\r\n“The allies of neither of the parties to the treaty shall be attacked\r\nby the other.\r\n\r\n“Neither party shall impose any contribution, nor erect any public\r\nbuilding, nor enlist soldiers in the dominions of the other, nor make\r\nany compact of friendship with the allies of the other.\r\n\r\n“The Carthaginians shall within ten years pay to the Romans\r\ntwo-thousand two-hundred talents, and a thousand on the spot; and shall\r\nrestore all prisoners, without ransom, to the Romans.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fifth treaty, B.C. 238.]\r\n\r\nAfterwards, at the end of the Mercenary war in Africa, the Romans went\r\nso far as to pass a decree for war with Carthage, but eventually made\r\na treaty to the following effect: “The Carthaginians shall evacuate\r\nSardinia, and pay an additional twelve hundred talents.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sixth treaty, B.C. 228.]\r\n\r\nFinally, in addition to these treaties, came that negotiated with\r\nHasdrubal in Iberia, in which it was stipulated that “the Carthaginians\r\nshould not cross the Iber with arms.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the mutual obligations established between Rome and Carthage\r\nfrom the earliest times to that of Hannibal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No excuse for the Roman claim on Sardinia.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ As we find then that the Roman invasion of Sicily was not in\r\ncontravention of their oaths, so we must acknowledge in the case of\r\nthe second proclamation of war, in consequence of which the treaty for\r\nthe evacuation of Sardinia was made, that it is impossible to find any\r\nreasonable pretext or ground for the Roman action. The Carthaginians\r\nwere beyond question compelled by the necessities of their position,\r\ncontrary to all justice, to evacuate Sardinia, and to pay this enormous\r\nsum of money. For as to the allegation of the Romans, that they had\r\nduring the Mercenary war been guilty of acts of hostility to ships\r\nsailing from Rome,—that was barred by their own act in restoring,\r\nwithout ransom, the Carthaginian prisoners, in gratitude for similar\r\nconduct on the part of Carthage to Romans who had landed on their\r\nshores; a transaction which I have spoken of at length in my previous\r\nbook.[168]\r\n\r\nThese facts established, it remains to decide by a thorough\r\ninvestigation to which of the two nations the origin of the Hannibalian\r\nwar is to be imputed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman Case.]\r\n\r\n+29.+ I have explained the pleas advanced by the Carthaginians; I must\r\nnow state what is alleged on the contrary by the Romans. For though\r\nit is true that in this particular interview, owing to their anger at\r\nthe fall of Saguntum, they did not use these arguments, yet they were\r\nappealed to on many occasions, and by many of their citizens. First,\r\nthey argued that the treaty of Hasdrubal could not be ignored, as the\r\nCarthaginians had the assurance to do: for it did not contain the\r\nclause, which that of Lutatius did, making its validity conditional\r\non its ratification by the people of Rome; but Hasdrubal made the\r\nagreement absolutely and authoritatively that “the Carthaginians should\r\nnot cross the Iber in arms.”\r\n\r\nNext they alleged that the clause in the treaty respecting Sicily,\r\nwhich by their own admission stipulated that “the allies of neither\r\nparty should be attacked by the other,” did not refer to then existing\r\nallies only, as the Carthaginians interpreted it; for in that case\r\na clause would have been added, disabling either from making new\r\nalliances in addition to those already existing, or excluding allies,\r\ntaken subsequently to the making of the treaty, from its benefits.\r\nBut since neither of these provisions was made, it was plain that\r\nboth the then existing allies, and all those taken subsequently on\r\neither side, were entitled to reciprocal security. And this was only\r\nreasonable. For it was not likely that they would have made a treaty\r\ndepriving them of the power, when opportunity offered, of taking on\r\nsuch friends or allies as seemed to their interest; nor, again, if they\r\nhad taken any such under their protection, was it to be supposed that\r\nthey would allow them to be injured by any persons whatever. But, in\r\nfact, the main thing present in the minds of both parties to the treaty\r\nwas, that they should mutually agree to abstain from attacking each\r\nother’s allies, and on no account admit into alliance with themselves\r\nthe allies of the other: and it was to subsequent allies that this\r\nparticular clause applied, “Neither shall enlist soldiers, or impose\r\ncontributions on the provinces or allies of the other; and all shall be\r\nalike secure of attack from the other side.”\r\n\r\n+30.+ These things being so, they argued that it was beyond controversy\r\nthat Saguntum had accepted the protection of Rome, several years before\r\nthe time of Hannibal. The strongest proof of this, and one which would\r\nnot be contested by the Carthaginians themselves, was that, when\r\npolitical disturbances broke out at Saguntum, the people chose the\r\nRomans, and not the Carthaginians, as arbitrators to settle the dispute\r\nand restore their constitution, although the latter were close at hand\r\nand were already established in Iberia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutual provocation.]\r\n\r\nI conclude, then, that if the destruction of Saguntum is to be regarded\r\nas the cause of this war, the Carthaginians must be acknowledged to be\r\nin the wrong, both in view of the treaty of Lutatius, which secured\r\nimmunity from attack for the allies of both parties, and in view of\r\nthe treaty of Hasdrubal, which disabled the Carthaginians from passing\r\nthe Iber with arms.[169] If on the other hand the taking Sardinia from\r\nthem, and imposing the heavy money fine which accompanied it, are to\r\nbe regarded as the causes, we must certainly acknowledge that the\r\nCarthaginians had good reason for undertaking the Hannibalian war: for\r\nas they had only yielded to the pressure of circumstances, so they\r\nseized a favourable turn in those circumstances to revenge themselves\r\non their injurers.\r\n\r\n+31.+ Some uncritical readers may perhaps say that such minute\r\ndiscussion on points of this kind is unnecessary. And if any man were\r\nentirely self-sufficing in every event, I might allow that the accurate\r\nknowledge of the past, though a graceful accomplishment, was perhaps\r\nnot essential: but as long as it is not in mere mortals to say this,\r\neither in public or private affairs,—seeing that no man of sense, even\r\nif he is prosperous for the moment, will ever reckon with certainty\r\non the future,—then I say that such knowledge is essential, and not\r\nmerely graceful. For take the three commonest cases. Suppose, first,\r\na statesman to be attacked either in his own person or in that of his\r\ncountry: or, secondly, suppose him to be anxious for a forward policy\r\nand to anticipate the attack of an enemy: or, lastly, suppose him to\r\ndesire to maintain the _status quo_. In all these cases it is history\r\nalone that can supply him with precedents, and teach him how, in the\r\nfirst case, to find supporters and allies; in the second, to incite\r\nco-operation; and in the third, to give vigour to the conservative\r\nforces which tend to maintain, as he desires, the existing state of\r\nthings. In the case of contemporaries, it is difficult to obtain an\r\ninsight into their purposes; because, as their words and actions are\r\ndictated by a desire of accommodating themselves to the necessity\r\nof the hour, and of keeping up appearances, the truth is too often\r\nobscured. Whereas the transactions of the past admit of being tested by\r\nnaked fact; and accordingly display without disguise the motives and\r\npurposes of the several persons engaged; and teach us from what sort\r\nof people to expect favour, active kindness, and assistance, or the\r\nreverse. They give us also many opportunities of distinguishing who\r\nwould be likely to pity us, feel indignation at our wrongs, and defend\r\nour cause,—a power that contributes very greatly to national as well\r\nas individual security. Neither the writer nor the reader of history,\r\ntherefore, should confine his attention to a bare statement of facts:\r\nhe must take into account all that preceded, accompanied, or followed\r\nthem. For if you take from history all explanation of cause, principle,\r\nand motive, and of the adaptation of the means to the end, what is left\r\nis a mere panorama without being instructive; and, though it may please\r\nfor the moment, has no abiding value.\r\n\r\n+32.+ Another mistake is to look upon my history as difficult to\r\nobtain or master, because of the number and size of the books. Compare\r\nit in these particulars with the various writings of the episodical\r\nhistorians. Is it not much easier to purchase and read my forty\r\nbooks, which are as it were all in one piece, and so to follow with a\r\ncomprehensive glance the events in Italy, Sicily, and Libya from the\r\ntime of Pyrrhus to the fall of Carthage, and those in the rest of the\r\nworld from the flight of Cleomenes of Sparta, continuously, to the\r\nbattle between the Achaeans and Romans at the Isthmus? To say nothing\r\nof the fact that the compositions of these historians are many times\r\nas numerous as mine, it is impossible for their readers to get any\r\ncertain information from them: first, because most of them differ in\r\ntheir account of the same transactions; and secondly, because they\r\nomit contemporary history,—the comparative review of which would put\r\na very different complexion upon events to that derived from isolated\r\ntreatment,—and are unable to touch upon the most decisive events at\r\nall. For, indeed, the most important parts of history are those which\r\ntreat the events which follow or accompany a certain course of conduct,\r\nand pre-eminently so those which treat of causes. For instance, we\r\nsee that the war with Antiochus took its rise from that with Philip;\r\nthat with Philip from the Hannibalian; and the Hannibalian from the\r\nSicilian war: and though between these wars there were numerous events\r\nof various character, they all converged upon the same consummation.\r\nSuch a comprehensive view may be obtained from universal history, but\r\nnot from the histories of particular wars, such as those with Perseus\r\nor Philip; unless we fondly imagine that, by reading the accounts\r\ncontained in them of the pitched battles, we gain a knowledge of the\r\nconduct and plan of the whole war. This of course is not the case; and\r\nin the present instance I hope that there will be as wide a difference\r\nbetween my history and such episodical compositions, as between real\r\nlearning and mere listening.\r\n\r\n+33.+ To resume the story of the Carthaginians and the Roman\r\ndeputies.[170] To the arguments of the former the [Sidenote: Answer\r\nof Fabius. See Livy, 21, 18.] ambassadors made no answer, except that\r\nthe senior among them, in the presence of the assembly, pointed to the\r\nfolds of his toga and said that in them he carried peace and war, and\r\nthat he would bring out and leave with them whichever they bade him.\r\nThe Carthaginian Suffete[171] bade him bring out whichever of the two\r\nhe chose: and upon the Roman saying that it should be war, a majority\r\nof the senators cried out in answer that they accepted it. It was on\r\nthese terms that the Senate and the Roman ambassadors parted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter of 219-218 B.C. Hannibal’s arrangements for the\r\ncoming campaign.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hannibal, upon going into winter quarters at New Carthage,\r\nfirst of all dismissed the Iberians to their various cities, with\r\nthe view of their being prepared and vigorous for the next campaign.\r\nSecondly, he instructed his brother Hasdrubal in the management of\r\nhis government in Iberia, and of the preparations to be made against\r\nRome, in case he himself should be separated from him. Thirdly, he\r\ntook precautions for the security of Libya, by selecting with prudent\r\nskill certain soldiers from the home army to come over to Iberia, and\r\ncertain from the Iberian army to go to Libya; by which interchange\r\nhe secured cordial feeling of confidence between the two armies. The\r\nIberians sent to Libya were the Thersitae, the Mastiani, as well as\r\nthe Oretes and Olcades, mustering together twelve hundred cavalry and\r\nthirteen thousand eight hundred and fifty foot. Besides these there\r\nwere eight hundred and seventy slingers from the Balearic Isles,\r\nwhose name, as that of the islands they inhabit, is derived from the\r\nword _ballein_, “to throw,” because of their peculiar skill with the\r\nsling. Most of these troops he ordered to be stationed at Metagonia\r\nin Libya, and the rest in Carthage itself. And from the cities in the\r\ndistrict of Metagonia he sent four thousand foot also into Carthage,\r\nto serve at once as hostages for the fidelity of their country, and\r\nas an additional guard for the city. With his brother Hasdrubal in\r\nIberia he left fifty quinqueremes, two quadriremes, and five triremes,\r\nthirty-two of the quinqueremes being furnished with crews, and all five\r\nof the triremes; also cavalry consisting of four hundred and fifty\r\nLibyophenicians and Libyans, three hundred Lergetae, eighteen hundred\r\nNumidians of the Massolian, Massaesylian, Maccoeian, and Maurian\r\ntribes, who dwell by the ocean; with eleven thousand eight hundred and\r\nfifty Libyans, three hundred Ligures, five hundred of the Balearic\r\nIslanders, and twenty-one elephants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The inscription recording these facts.]\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of this enumeration of Hannibal’s Iberian establishment\r\nneed excite no surprise, though it is such as a commander himself would\r\nhave some difficulty in displaying; nor ought I to be condemned at once\r\nof imitating the specious falsehoods of historians: for the fact is\r\nthat I myself found on Lacinium[172] a bronze tablet, which Hannibal\r\nhad caused to be inscribed with these particulars when he was in Italy;\r\nand holding it to be an entirely trustworthy authority for such facts,\r\nI did not hesitate to follow it.\r\n\r\n+34.+ Though Hannibal had taken every precaution for the security of\r\nLibya and Iberia, he yet waited for the messengers whom he expected to\r\narrive from the Celts. He had thoroughly acquainted himself with the\r\nfertility and populousness of the districts at the foot of the Alps\r\nand in the valley of the Padus, as well as with the warlike courage\r\nof the men; but most important of all, with their hostile feelings\r\nto Rome derived from the previous war, which I described in my last\r\nbook, with the express purpose of enabling my readers to follow my\r\nnarrative. He therefore reckoned very much on the chance of their\r\nco-operation; and was careful to send messages to the chiefs of the\r\nCelts, whether dwelling actually on the Alps or on the Italian side of\r\nthem, with unlimited promises; because he believed that he would be\r\nable to confine the war against Rome to Italy, if he could make his way\r\nthrough the intervening difficulties to these parts, and avail himself\r\nof the active alliance of the Celts. When his messengers returned with\r\na report that the Celts were ready to help him and all eagerness for\r\nhis approach; and that the passage of the Alps, though laborious and\r\ndifficult, was not, however, impossible, he collected his forces from\r\ntheir winter quarters at the approach of spring. Just before receiving\r\nthis report he had learnt the circumstances attending the Roman embassy\r\nat Carthage. Encouraged by the assurance thus given him, that he would\r\nbe supported by the popular sentiment at home, he no longer disguised\r\nfrom his army that the object of the forthcoming campaign was Rome; and\r\ntried to inspire them with courage for the undertaking. He explained to\r\nthem how the Romans had demanded the surrender of himself and all the\r\nofficers of the army: and pointed out the fertility of the country to\r\nwhich they were going, and the goodwill and active alliance which the\r\nCelts were prepared to offer them. When the crowd of soldiers showed\r\nan enthusiastic readiness to accompany him, he dismissed the assembly,\r\nafter thanking them, and naming the day on which he intended to march.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 218. Hannibal breaks up his winter quarters and starts\r\nfor Italy.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ These measures satisfactorily accomplished while he was in winter\r\nquarters, and the security of Libya and Iberia being sufficiently\r\nprovided for; when the appointed day arrived, Hannibal got his army in\r\nmotion, which consisted of ninety thousand infantry and about twelve\r\nthousand cavalry. After crossing the Iber, he set about subduing the\r\ntribes of the Ilurgetes and Bargusii, as well as the Aerenosii and\r\nAndosini, as far as the Pyrenees. When he had reduced all this country\r\nunder his power, and taken certain towns by storm, which he did with\r\nunexpected rapidity, though not without severe fighting and serious\r\nloss; he left Hanno in chief command of all the district north of the\r\nIber, and with absolute authority over the Burgusii, who were the\r\npeople that gave him most uneasiness on account of their friendly\r\nfeeling towards Rome. He then detached from his army ten thousand\r\nfoot and a thousand horse for the service of Hanno,—to whom also he\r\nentrusted the heavy baggage of the troops that were to accompany\r\nhimself,—and the same number to go to their own land. The object of\r\nthis last measure was twofold: he thereby left a certain number of\r\nwell-affected persons behind him; and also held out to the others a\r\nhope of returning home, both to those Iberians who were to accompany\r\nhim on his march, and to those also who for the present were to remain\r\nat home, so that there might be a general alacrity to join him if he\r\nwere ever in want of a reinforcement. He then set his remaining troops\r\nin motion unencumbered by heavy baggage, fifty thousand infantry and\r\nnine thousand cavalry, and led them through the Pyrenees to the passage\r\nof the river Rhone. The army was not so much numerous, as highly\r\nefficient, and in an extraordinary state of physical training from\r\ntheir continuous battles with the Iberians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Geography of Hannibal’s march.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ But as a knowledge of topography is necessary for the right\r\nunderstanding of my narrative, I must state the places from which\r\nHannibal started, through which he marched, and into which he descended\r\nwhen he arrived in Italy. Nor must I, like some historians, content\r\nmyself with mentioning the mere names of places and rivers, under\r\nthe idea that that is quite sufficient to give a clear knowledge. My\r\nopinion is that, in the case of well-known places, the mention of names\r\nis of great assistance, but that, in the case of unknown countries,\r\nnames are no better than unintelligible and unmeaning sounds: for the\r\nunderstanding having nothing to go upon, and being unable by referring\r\nto something known to translate the words into thought, the narrative\r\nbecomes confused and vague, and conveys no clear idea. A plan therefore\r\nmust be discovered, whereby it shall be possible, while speaking of\r\nunknown countries, to convey real and intelligible notions.\r\n\r\nThe first, most important, and most general conception is that of the\r\ndivision of the heaven into four quarters, which all of us that are\r\ncapable of a general idea at all know as east, west, south, and north.\r\nThe next is to arrange the several parts of the globe according to\r\nthese points, and always to refer in thought any place mentioned to\r\none or other of them. We shall thus get an intelligible and familiar\r\nconception of places which we do not know or have never seen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General view of the geography of the world.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ This principle established as universally applicable to the\r\nworld, the next point will be to make the geography of our own part of\r\nit intelligible by a corresponding division.\r\n\r\nIt falls, then, into three divisions, each distinguished by a\r\nparticular name,—Asia, Libya, Europe.[173] The boundaries are\r\nrespectively the Don, the Nile, and the Straits of the Pillars of\r\nHercules. Asia lies between the Don and the Nile, and lies under that\r\nportion of the heaven which is between the north-east and the south.\r\nLibya lies between the Nile and the Pillars of Hercules, and falls\r\nbeneath the south portion of the heaven, extending to the south-west\r\nwithout a break, till it reaches the point of the equinoctial sunset,\r\nwhich corresponds with the Pillars of Hercules. These two divisions\r\nof the earth, therefore, regarded in a general point of view, occupy\r\nall that part which is south of the Mediterranean from east to west.\r\nEurope with respect to both of these lies to the north facing them,\r\nand extending continuously from east to west. Its most important and\r\nextensive part lies under the northern sky between the river Don and\r\nthe Narbo, which is only a short distance west of Marseilles and\r\nthe mouths by which the Rhone discharges itself into the Sardinian\r\nSea. From Narbo is the district occupied by the Celts as far as the\r\nPyrenees, stretching continuously from the Mediterranean to the Mare\r\nExternum. The rest of Europe south of the Pyrenees, to the point where\r\nit approaches the Pillars of Hercules, is bounded on one side by the\r\nMediterranean, on the other by the Mare Externum; and that part of it\r\nwhich is washed by the Mediterranean as far as the Pillars of Hercules\r\nis called Iberia, while the part which lies along the Outer or Great\r\nSea has no general name, because it has but recently been discovered,\r\nand is inhabited entirely by barbarous tribes, who are very numerous,\r\nand of whom I will speak in more detail hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The extreme north and south unknown.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ But as no one up to our time has been able to settle in regard\r\nto those parts of Asia and Libya, where they approach each other in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Ethiopia, whether the continent is continuous to\r\nthe south, or is surrounded by the sea, so it is in regard to the part\r\nbetween Narbo and the Don: none of us as yet knows anything of the\r\nnorthern extent of this district, and anything we can ever know must be\r\nthe result of future exploration; and those who rashly venture by word\r\nof mouth or written statements to describe this district must be looked\r\nupon as ignorant or romancing.\r\n\r\nMy object in these observations was to prevent my narrative being\r\nentirely vague to those who were unacquainted with the localities. I\r\nhoped that, by keeping these broad distinctions in mind, they would\r\nhave some definite standard to which to refer every mention of a place,\r\nstarting from the primary one of the division of the sky into four\r\nquarters. For, as in the case of physical sight, we instinctively turn\r\nour faces to any object pointed at; so in the case of the mind, our\r\nthoughts ought to turn naturally to localities as they are mentioned\r\nfrom time to time.\r\n\r\nIt is time now to return to the story we have in hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The length of the march from Carthagena to the Po, 1125\r\nRoman miles.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ At this period the Carthaginians were masters of the whole\r\nMediterranean coast of Libya from the Altars of Philaenus,[174]\r\nopposite the Great Syrtis, to the Pillars of Hercules, a seaboard of\r\nover sixteen thousand stades. They had also crossed the strait of the\r\nPillars of Hercules, and got possession of the whole seaboard of Iberia\r\non the Mediterranean as far as the Pyrenees, which separate the Iberes\r\nfrom the Celts—that is, for a distance of about eight thousand stades:\r\nfor it is three thousand from the Pillars to New Carthage, from which\r\nHannibal started for Italy; two thousand six hundred from thence to\r\nthe Iber; and from that river to Emporium again sixteen hundred; from\r\nwhich town, I may add, to the passage of the Rhone is a distance of\r\nabout sixteen hundred stades; for all these distances have now been\r\ncarefully measured by the Romans and marked with milestones at every\r\neighth stade.[175] After crossing the river there was a march up stream\r\nalong its bank of fourteen hundred stades, before reaching the foot of\r\nthe pass over the Alps into Italy. The pass itself was about twelve\r\nhundred stades, which being crossed would bring him into the plains\r\nof the Padus in Italy. So that the whole length of his march from New\r\nCarthage was about nine thousand stades, or 1125 Roman miles. Of the\r\ncountry he had thus to traverse he had already passed almost half in\r\nmere distance, but in the difficulties the greater part of his task was\r\nstill before him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coss. P. Cornelius Scipio and Tib. Sempronius Longus. B.C.\r\n218. The Consuls are sent, one to Spain, and the other to Africa.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Placentia and Cremona.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Outrage by Boii and Insubres.]\r\n\r\n+40.+ While Hannibal was thus engaged in effecting a passage over the\r\nPyrenees, where he was greatly alarmed at the extraordinary strength\r\nof the positions occupied by the Celts; the Romans, having heard the\r\nresult of the embassy to Carthage, and that Hannibal had crossed\r\nthe Iber earlier than they expected, at the head of an army, voted\r\nto send Publius Cornelius Scipio with his legions into Iberia, and\r\nTiberius Sempronius Longus into Libya. And while the Consuls were\r\nengaged in hastening on the enrolment of their legions and other\r\nmilitary preparations, the people were active in bringing to completion\r\nthe colonies which they had already voted to send into Gaul. They\r\naccordingly caused the fortification of these towns to be energetically\r\npushed on, and ordered the colonists to be in residence within thirty\r\ndays: six thousand having been assigned to each colony. One of these\r\ncolonies was on the south bank of the Padus, and was called Placentia;\r\nthe other on the north bank, called Cremona. But no sooner had these\r\ncolonies been formed, than the Boian Gauls, who had long been lying in\r\nwait to throw off their loyalty to Rome, but had up to that time lacked\r\nan opportunity, encouraged by the news that reached them of Hannibal’s\r\napproach, revolted; thus abandoning the hostages which they had given\r\nat the end of the war described in my last book. The ill-feeling still\r\nremaining towards Rome enabled them to induce the Insubres to join in\r\nthe revolt; and the united tribes swept over the territory recently\r\nallotted by the Romans, and following close upon the track of the\r\nflying colonists, laid siege to the Roman colony of Mutina, in which\r\nthe fugitives had taken refuge. Among them were the _triumviri_ or\r\nthree commissioners who had been sent out to allot the lands, of whom\r\none—Gaius Lutatius—was an ex-consul, the other two ex-praetors. These\r\nmen having demanded a parley with the enemy, the Boii consented: but\r\ntreacherously seized them upon their leaving the town, hoping by their\r\nmeans to recover their own hostages. The praetor Lucius Manlius was\r\non guard in the district with an army, and as soon as he heard what\r\nhad happened, he advanced with all speed to the relief of Mutina.\r\nBut the Boii, having got intelligence of his approach, prepared an\r\nambuscade; and as soon as his army had entered a certain wood, they\r\nrushed out upon it from every side and killed a large number of his\r\nmen. The survivors at first fled with precipitation: but having gained\r\nsome higher ground, they rallied sufficiently to enable them with much\r\ndifficulty to effect an honourable retreat. Even so, the Boii followed\r\nclose upon their heels, and besieged them in a place called the\r\nvillage of Tannes.[176] When the news arrived at Rome, that the fourth\r\nlegion was surrounded and closely besieged by the Boii, the people in\r\nall haste despatched the legions which had been voted to the Consul\r\nPublius, to their relief, under the command of a Praetor, and ordered\r\nthe Consul to enrol two more legions for himself from the allies.\r\n\r\n+41.+ Such was the state of Celtic affairs from the beginning to the\r\narrival of Hannibal; thus completing the course of events which I have\r\nalready had occasion to describe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius Sempronius prepares to attack Carthage.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Consuls, having completed the necessary preparations for\r\ntheir respective missions, set sail at the beginning of summer—Publius\r\nto Iberia, with sixty ships, and Tiberius Sempronius to Libya, with a\r\nhundred and sixty quinqueremes. The latter thought by means of this\r\ngreat fleet to strike terror into the enemy; and made vast preparations\r\nat Lilybaeum, collecting fresh troops wherever he could get them, as\r\nthough with the view of at once blockading Carthage itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Publius Scipio lands near Marseilles.]\r\n\r\nPublius Cornelius coasted along Liguria, and crossing in five days\r\nfrom Pisae to Marseilles, dropped anchor at the most eastern mouth of\r\nthe Rhone, called the Mouth of Marseilles,[177] and began disembarking\r\nhis troops. For though he heard that Hannibal was already crossing the\r\nPyrenees, he felt sure that he was still a long way off, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of his line of country, and the number of the intervening\r\nCeltic tribes. But long before he was expected, Hannibal had arrived\r\nat the crossing of the Rhone, keeping the Sardinian Sea on his right\r\nas he marched, and having made his way through the Celts partly by\r\nbribes and partly by force. Being informed that the enemy were at hand,\r\nPublius was at first incredulous of the fact, because of the rapidity\r\nof the advance; but wishing to know the exact state of the case,—while\r\nstaying behind himself to refresh his troops after their voyage, and to\r\nconsult with the Tribunes as to the best ground on which to give the\r\nenemy battle,—he sent out a reconnoitring party, consisting of three\r\nhundred of his bravest horse; joining with them as guides and supports\r\nsome Celts, who chanced to be serving as mercenaries at the time in\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal reaches the Rhone.]\r\n\r\n+42.+ Meanwhile Hannibal had reached the river and was trying to get\r\nacross it where the stream was single, at a distance of four days’\r\nmarch from the sea. He did all he could to make the natives living by\r\nthe river friendly to him, and purchased from them all their canoes of\r\nhollow trunks, and wherries, of which there were a large number, owing\r\nto the extensive sea traffic of the inhabitants of the Rhone valley.\r\nHe got from them also the timber suited to the construction of these\r\ncanoes; and so in two days had an innumerable supply of transports,\r\nevery soldier seeking to be independent of his neighbour, and to have\r\nthe means of crossing in his own hands. But now a large multitude of\r\nbarbarians collected on the other side of the stream to hinder the\r\npassage of the Carthaginians. When Hannibal saw them, he came to the\r\nconclusion that it would be impossible either to force a passage in\r\nthe face of so large a body of the enemy, or to remain where he was,\r\nfor fear of being attacked on all sides at once: and he accordingly,\r\non the third night, sent forward a detachment of his army with native\r\nguides, under the command of Hanno, the son of the Suffete[178]\r\nBomilcar. [Sidenote: A detachment crosses higher up the river.] This\r\nforce marched up stream along the bank for two hundred stades, until\r\nthey arrived at a certain spot where the stream is divided by an eyot,\r\nand there halted. They found enough wood close at hand to enable them,\r\nby nailing or tying it together, to construct within a short time a\r\nlarge number of rafts good enough for temporary use; and on these they\r\ncrossed in safety, without any one trying to stop them. Then, seizing\r\nupon a strong position, they kept quiet for the rest of the day: partly\r\nto refresh themselves after their fatigues, and at the same time to\r\ncomplete their preparations for the service awaiting them, as they had\r\nbeen ordered to do. Hannibal was preparing to proceed much in the same\r\nway with the forces left behind with himself; but his chief difficulty\r\nwas in getting the elephants across, of which he had thirty-seven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The crossing begun.]\r\n\r\n+43.+ When the fifth night came, however, the division which had\r\ncrossed first started before daybreak to march down the opposite bank\r\nof the river and attack the barbarians; while Hannibal, having his men\r\nin readiness, began to attempt the passage of the river. He had filled\r\nthe wherries with the heavy-armed cavalry, and the canoes with the most\r\nactive of his foot; and he now arranged that the wherries should cross\r\nhigher up the stream, and the canoes below them, that the violence of\r\nthe current might be broken by the former, and the canoes cross more\r\nsafely. The plan for the horses was that they should swim at the stern\r\nof the wherries, one man on each side of the stern guiding three or\r\nfour with leading reins: so that a considerable number of horses were\r\nbrought over at once with the first detachment. When they saw what the\r\nenemy meant to do, the barbarians, without forming their ranks, poured\r\nout of their entrenchments in scattered groups, feeling no doubt of\r\nbeing able to stop the crossing of the Carthaginians with ease. As soon\r\nas Hannibal saw by the smoke, which was the signal agreed upon, that\r\nthe advanced detachment on the other side was approaching, he ordered\r\nall to go on board, and the men in charge of the transports to push\r\nout against the stream. This was promptly done: and then began a most\r\nanxious and exciting scene. Cheer after cheer rose from the men who\r\nwere working the boats, as they struggled to outstrip each other, and\r\nexerted themselves to the utmost to overcome the force of the current.\r\nOn the edge of either bank stood the two armies: the one sharing in the\r\nstruggles of their comrades by sympathy, and shouting encouragement\r\nto them as they went; while the barbarians in front of them yelled\r\ntheir war-cries and challenged them to battle. While this was going on\r\nthe barbarians had abandoned their tents, which the Carthaginians on\r\nthat side of the river suddenly and unexpectedly seized. Some of them\r\nproceeded to set fire to the camp, while the greater number went to\r\nattack the men who were standing ready to resist the passage. Surprised\r\nby this unlooked-for event, some of the barbarians rushed off to save\r\ntheir tents, while others prepared to resist the attack of the enemy,\r\nand were now actually engaged. Seeing that everything was going as\r\nhe had intended, Hannibal at once formed the first division as it\r\ndisembarked: and after addressing some encouraging words to it, closed\r\nwith the barbarians, who, having no time to form their ranks, and being\r\ntaken by surprise, were quickly repulsed and put to flight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Completed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Message from friendly Gauls.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ Being thus master of the passage of the river, and victorious\r\nover those who opposed him, the first care of the Carthaginian\r\nleader was to bring his whole army across. This being expeditiously\r\naccomplished, he pitched his camp for that night by the river-side, and\r\non the morrow, when he was told that the Roman fleet was anchored off\r\nthe mouths of the river, he detached five hundred Numidian horsemen\r\nto reconnoitre the enemy and find out their position, their numbers,\r\nand what they were going to do; and at the same time selected suitable\r\nmen to manage the passage of the elephants. These arrangements made,\r\nhe summoned a meeting of his army and introduced Magilus and the other\r\nchiefs who had come to him from the valley of the Padus, and caused\r\nthem to declare to the whole army, by means of an interpreter, the\r\nresolutions passed by their tribes. The points which were the strongest\r\nencouragement to the army were, first, the actual appearance of envoys\r\ninviting them to come, and promising to take part in the war with Rome;\r\nsecondly, the confidence inspired by their promise of guiding them by\r\na route where they would be abundantly supplied with necessaries, and\r\nwhich would lead them with speed and safety into Italy; and, lastly,\r\nthe fertility and vast extent of the country to which they were going,\r\nand the friendly feelings of the men with whose assistance they were\r\nabout to fight the armies of Rome.\r\n\r\nSuch was the substance of the speeches of the Celts. When they had\r\nwithdrawn, Hannibal himself rose, and after reminding the soldiers\r\nof what they had already achieved, and pointing out that, though\r\nthey had under his counsel and advice engaged in many perilous and\r\ndangerous enterprises, they had never failed in one, he bade them “not\r\nlose courage now that the most serious part of their undertaking was\r\naccomplished. The Rhone was crossed: they had seen with their own eyes\r\nthe display of goodwill and zeal of their allies. Let this convince\r\nthem that they should leave the rest to him with confidence; and while\r\nobeying his orders show themselves men of courage and worthy of their\r\nformer deeds.” These words being received with shouts of approval, and\r\nother manifestations of great enthusiasm, on the part of the soldiers,\r\nHannibal dismissed the assembly with words of praise to the men and\r\na prayer to the gods on their behalf; after giving out an order that\r\nthey should refresh themselves, and make all their preparations with\r\ndespatch, as the advance must begin on the morrow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skirmish between reconnoitring parties.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ When the assembly had been dismissed, the reconnoitring party\r\nof Numidians returned in headlong flight, after losing more than half\r\ntheir numbers. Not far from the camp they had fallen in with a party\r\nof Roman horse, who had been sent out by Publius on the same errand;\r\nand an engagement took place with such fury on either side, that the\r\nRomans and Celts lost a hundred and forty men, and the Numidians more\r\nthan two hundred. After this skirmish, the Romans pursued them up to\r\nthe Carthaginian entrenchments: and having surveyed it, they hastened\r\nback to announce to the Consul the presence of the enemy. As soon as\r\nthey arrived at the Roman camp with this intelligence, Publius put his\r\nbaggage on board ship, and marched his men up the bank of the river,\r\nwith the earnest desire of forcing the enemy to give him battle.\r\n\r\nBut at sunrise on the day after the assembly, Hannibal having stationed\r\nhis whole cavalry on the rear, in the direction of the sea, so as to\r\ncover the advance, ordered his infantry to leave the entrenchment and\r\nbegin their march; while he himself waited behind for the elephants,\r\nand the men who had not yet crossed the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the elephants.]\r\n\r\n+46.+ The mode of getting the elephants across was as follows. They\r\nmade a number of rafts strongly compacted, which they lashed firmly\r\ntwo and two together, so as to form combined a breadth of about fifty\r\nfeet, and brought them close under the bank at the place of crossing.\r\nTo the outer edge of these they lashed some others and made them join\r\nexactly; so that the whole raft thus constructed stretched out some way\r\ninto the channel, while the edges towards the stream were made fast to\r\nthe land with ropes tied to trees which grew along the brink, to secure\r\nthe raft keeping its place and not drifting down the river. These\r\ncombined rafts stretching about two hundred feet across the stream,\r\nthey joined two other very large ones to the outer edges, fastened very\r\nfirmly together, but connected with the others by ropes which admitted\r\nof being easily cut. To these they fastened several towing lines,\r\nthat the wherries might prevent the rafts drifting down stream, and\r\nmight drag them forcibly against the current and so get the elephants\r\nacross on them. Then they threw a great deal of earth upon all the\r\nrafts, until they had raised the surface to the level of the bank, and\r\nmade it look like the path on the land leading down to the passage.\r\nThe elephants were accustomed to obey their Indian riders until they\r\ncame to water, but could never be induced to step into water: they\r\ntherefore led them upon this earth, putting two females in front whom\r\nthe others obediently followed. When they had set foot on the rafts\r\nthat were farthest out in the stream, the ropes were cut which fastened\r\nthese to the other rafts, the towing lines were pulled taut by the\r\nwherries, and the elephants, with the rafts on which they stood, were\r\nquickly towed away from the mound of earth. When this happened, the\r\nanimals were terror-stricken; and at first turned round and round, and\r\nrushed first to one part of the raft and then to another, but finding\r\nthemselves completely surrounded by the water, they were too frightened\r\nto do anything, and were obliged to stay where they were. And it was by\r\nrepeating this contrivance of joining a pair of rafts to the others,\r\nthat eventually the greater part of the elephants were got across.\r\nSome of them, however, in the middle of the crossing, threw themselves\r\nin their terror into the river: but though their Indian riders were\r\ndrowned, the animals themselves got safe to land, saved by the strength\r\nand great length of their probosces; for by raising these above the\r\nwater, they were enabled to breathe through them, and blow out any\r\nwater that got into them, while for the most part they got through the\r\nriver on their feet.\r\n\r\n+47.+ The elephants having been thus got across, Hannibal formed them\r\nand the cavalry into a rear-guard, and marched up the river bank away\r\nfrom the sea in an easterly direction, as though making for the central\r\ndistrict of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Rhone rises to the north-west of the Adriatic Gulf on the northern\r\nslopes of the Alps,[179] and flowing westward, eventually discharges\r\nitself into the Sardinian Sea. It flows for the most part through\r\na deep valley, to the north of which lives the Celtic tribe of the\r\nArdyes; while its southern side is entirely walled in by the northern\r\nslopes of the Alps, the ridges of which, beginning at Marseilles and\r\nextending to the head of the Adriatic, separate it from the valley of\r\nthe Padus, of which I have already had occasion to speak at length. It\r\nwas these mountains that Hannibal now crossed from the Rhone valley\r\ninto Italy.\r\n\r\nSome historians of this passage of the Alps, in their desire to\r\nproduce a striking effect by their descriptions of the wonders of this\r\ncountry, have fallen into two errors which are more alien than anything\r\nelse to the spirit of history,—perversion of fact and inconsistency.\r\nIntroducing Hannibal as a prodigy of strategic skill and boldness, they\r\nyet represent him as acting with the most conspicuous indiscretion;\r\nand then, finding themselves involved in an inextricable maze of\r\nfalsehood, they try to cut the knot by the introduction of gods and\r\nheroes into what is meant to be genuine history. They begin by saying\r\nthat the Alps are so precipitous and inaccessible that, so far from\r\nhorses and troops, accompanied too by elephants, being able to cross\r\nthem, it would be very difficult for even active men on foot to do so:\r\nand similarly they tell us that the desolation of this district is so\r\ncomplete, that, had not some god or hero met Hannibal’s forces and\r\nshowed them the way, they would have been hopelessly lost and perished\r\nto a man.\r\n\r\nSuch stories involve both the errors I have mentioned,—they are both\r\nfalse and inconsistent.\r\n\r\n+48.+ For could a more irrational proceeding on the part of a general\r\nbe imagined than that of Hannibal, if, when in command of so numerous\r\nan army, on whom the success of his expedition entirely depended,\r\nhe allowed himself to remain in ignorance of the roads, the lie of\r\nthe country, the route to be taken, and the people to which it led,\r\nand above all as to the practicability of what he was undertaking\r\nto do? They, in fact, represent Hannibal, when at the height of his\r\nexpectation of success, doing what those would hardly do who have\r\nutterly failed and have been reduced to despair,—that is, to entrust\r\nthemselves and their forces to an unknown country. And so, too, what\r\nthey say about the desolation of the district, and its precipitous and\r\ninaccessible character, only serves to bring their untrustworthiness\r\ninto clearer light. For first, they pass over the fact that the Celts\r\nof the Rhone valley had on several occasions before Hannibal came,\r\nand that in very recent times, crossed the Alps with large forces,\r\nand fought battles with the Romans in alliance with the Celts of the\r\nvalley of the Padus, as I have already stated. And secondly, they are\r\nunaware of the fact that a very numerous tribe of people inhabit the\r\nAlps. Accordingly in their ignorance of these facts they take refuge\r\nin the assertion that a hero showed Hannibal the way. They are, in\r\nfact, in the same case as tragedians, who, beginning with an improbable\r\nand impossible plot, are obliged to bring in a _deus ex machina_ to\r\nsolve the difficulty and end the play. The absurd premises of these\r\nhistorians naturally require some such supernatural agency to help them\r\nout of the difficulty: an absurd beginning could only have an absurd\r\nending. For of course Hannibal did not act as these writers say he did;\r\nbut, on the contrary, conducted his plans with the utmost prudence.\r\nHe had thoroughly informed himself of the fertility of the country\r\ninto which he designed to descend, and of the hostile feelings of its\r\ninhabitants towards Rome, and for his journey through the difficult\r\ndistrict which intervened he employed native guides and pioneers, whose\r\ninterests were bound up with his own. I speak with confidence on these\r\npoints, because I have questioned persons actually engaged on the\r\nfacts, and have inspected the country, and gone over the Alpine pass\r\nmyself, in order to inform myself of the truth and see with my own eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scipio finds that Hannibal has escaped him.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ Three days after Hannibal had resumed his march, the Consul\r\nPublius arrived at the passage of the river. He was in the highest\r\ndegree astonished to find the enemy gone: for he had persuaded himself\r\nthat they would never venture to take this route into Italy, on account\r\nof the numbers and fickleness of the barbarians who inhabited the\r\ncountry. But seeing that they had done so, he hurried back to his ships\r\nand at once embarked his forces. He then despatched his brother Gnaeus\r\nto conduct the campaign in Iberia, while he himself turned back again\r\nto Italy by sea, being anxious to anticipate the enemy by marching\r\nthrough Etruria to the foot of the pass of the Alps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s march to the foot of the Alps.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after four days’ march from the passage of the Rhone,\r\nHannibal arrived at the place called the Island, a district thickly\r\ninhabited and exceedingly productive of corn. Its name is derived\r\nfrom its natural features: for the Rhone and Isara flowing on either\r\nside of it make the apex of a triangle where they meet, very nearly\r\nof the same size and shape as the delta of the Nile, except that the\r\nbase of the latter is formed by the sea into which its various streams\r\nare discharged, while in the case of the former this base is formed\r\nby mountains difficult to approach or climb, and, so to speak, almost\r\ninaccessible. When Hannibal arrived in this district he found two\r\nbrothers engaged in a dispute for the royal power, and confronting each\r\nother with their armies. The elder sought his alliance and invited\r\nhis assistance in gaining the crown: and the advantage which such a\r\ncircumstance might prove to him at that juncture of his affairs being\r\nmanifest, he consented; and having joined him in his attack upon his\r\nbrother, and aided in expelling him, he obtained valuable support from\r\nthe victorious chieftain. For this prince not only liberally supplied\r\nhis army with provisions, but exchanged all their old and damaged\r\nweapons for new ones, and thus at a very opportune time thoroughly\r\nrestored the efficiency of the troops: he also gave most of the men\r\nnew clothes and boots, which proved of great advantage during their\r\npassage of the mountains. But his most essential service was that, the\r\nCarthaginians being greatly alarmed at the prospect of marching through\r\nthe territory of the Allobroges, he acted with his army as their\r\nrear-guard, and secured them a safe passage as far as the foot of the\r\npass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ascent.]\r\n\r\n+50.+ Having in ten days’ march accomplished a distance of eight\r\nhundred stades along the river bank, Hannibal began the ascent of the\r\nAlps,[180] and immediately found himself involved in the most serious\r\ndangers. For as long as the Carthaginians were on the plains, the\r\nvarious chiefs of the Allobroges refrained from attacking them from\r\nfear of their cavalry, as well as of the Gauls who were escorting\r\nthem. But when these last departed back again to their own lands,\r\nand Hannibal began to enter the mountainous region, the chiefs of\r\nthe Allobroges collected large numbers of their tribe and occupied\r\nthe points of vantage in advance, on the route by which Hannibal’s\r\ntroops were constrained to make their ascent. If they had only kept\r\ntheir design secret, the Carthaginian army would have been entirely\r\ndestroyed: as it was, their plans became known, and though they did\r\nmuch damage to Hannibal’s army, they suffered as much themselves. For\r\nwhen that general learnt that the natives were occupying the points\r\nof vantage, he halted and pitched his camp at the foot of the pass,\r\nand sent forward some of his Gallic guides to reconnoitre the enemy\r\nand discover their plan of operations. The order was obeyed: and he\r\nascertained that it was the enemy’s practice to keep under arms, and\r\nguard these posts carefully, during the day, but at night to retire\r\nto some town in the neighbourhood. Hannibal accordingly adapted his\r\nmeasures to this strategy of the enemy. He marched forward in broad\r\ndaylight, and as soon as he came to the mountainous part of the road,\r\npitched his camp only a little way from the enemy. At nightfall he gave\r\norders for the watch-fires to be lit; and leaving the main body of his\r\ntroops in the camp, and selecting the most suitable of his men, he had\r\nthem armed lightly, and led them through the narrow parts of the road\r\nduring the night, and seized on the spots which had been previously\r\noccupied by the enemy: they having, according to their regular custom,\r\nabandoned them for the nearest town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gauls harass the army.]\r\n\r\n+51.+ When day broke the natives saw what had taken place, and at\r\nfirst desisted from their attempts; but presently the sight of the\r\nimmense string of beasts of burden, and of the cavalry, slowly and\r\npainfully making the ascent, tempted them to attack the advancing\r\nline. Accordingly they fell upon it at many points at once; and the\r\nCarthaginians sustained severe losses, not so much at the hands of\r\nthe enemy, as from the dangerous nature of the ground, which proved\r\nespecially fatal to the horses and beasts of burden. For as the ascent\r\nwas not only narrow and rough, but flanked also with precipices, at\r\nevery movement which tended to throw the line into disorder, large\r\nnumbers of the beasts of burden were hurled down the precipices with\r\ntheir loads on their backs. And what added more than anything else to\r\nthis sort of confusion were the wounded horses; for, maddened by their\r\nwounds, they either turned round and ran into the advancing beasts of\r\nburden, or, rushing furiously forward, dashed aside everything that\r\ncame in their way on the narrow path, and so threw the whole line into\r\ndisorder. Hannibal saw what was taking place, and knowing that, even\r\nif they escaped this attack, they could never survive the loss of all\r\ntheir baggage, he took with him the men who had seized the strongholds\r\nduring the night and went to the relief of the advancing line. Having\r\nthe advantage of charging the enemy from the higher ground he inflicted\r\na severe loss upon them, but suffered also as severe a one in his\r\nown army; for the commotion in the line now grew worse, and in both\r\ndirections at once—thanks to the shouting and struggling of these\r\ncombatants: and it was not until he had killed the greater number of\r\nthe Allobroges, and forced the rest to fly to their own land, that\r\nthe remainder of the beasts of burden and the horses got slowly, and\r\nwith difficulty, over the dangerous ground. Hannibal himself rallied\r\nas many as he could after the fight, and assaulted the town from\r\nwhich the enemy had sallied; and finding it almost deserted, because\r\nits inhabitants had been all tempted out by the hope of booty, he\r\ngot possession of it: from which he obtained many advantages for the\r\nfuture as well as for the present. The immediate gain consisted of a\r\nlarge number of horses and beasts of burden, and men taken with them;\r\nand for future use he got a supply of corn and cattle sufficient for\r\ntwo or three days: but the most important result of all was the terror\r\ninspired in the next tribes, which prevented any one of those who lived\r\nnear the ascent from lightly venturing to meddle with him again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treachery of the Gauls.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ Here he pitched a camp and remained a day, and started again. For\r\nthe next three days he accomplished a certain amount of his journey\r\nwithout accident. But on the fourth he again found himself in serious\r\ndanger. For the dwellers along his route, having concerted a plan of\r\ntreachery, met him with branches and garlands, which among nearly all\r\nthe natives are signs of friendship, as the herald’s staff is among the\r\nGreeks. Hannibal was cautious about accepting such assurances, and took\r\ngreat pains to discover what their real intention and purpose were.\r\nThe Gauls however professed to be fully aware of the capture of the\r\ntown, and the destruction of those who had attempted to do him wrong;\r\nand explained that those events had induced them to come, because they\r\nwished neither to inflict nor receive any damage; and finally promised\r\nto give him hostages. For a long while Hannibal hesitated and refused\r\nto trust their speeches. But at length coming to the conclusion that,\r\nif he accepted what was offered, he would perhaps render the men\r\nbefore him less mischievous and implacable; but that, if he rejected\r\nthem, he must expect undisguised hostility from them, he acceded to\r\ntheir request, and feigned to accept their offer of friendship. The\r\nbarbarians handed over the hostages, supplied him liberally with\r\ncattle, and in fact put themselves unreservedly into his hands; so that\r\nfor a time Hannibal’s suspicions were allayed, and he employed them as\r\nguides for the next difficulty that had to be passed. They guided the\r\narmy for two days: and then these tribes collected their numbers, and\r\nkeeping close up with the Carthaginians, attacked them just as they\r\nwere passing through a certain difficult and precipitous gorge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Severe losses.]\r\n\r\n+53.+ Hannibal’s army would now have certainly been utterly destroyed,\r\nhad it not been for the fact that his fears were still on the alert,\r\nand that, having a prescience of what was to come, he had placed his\r\nbaggage and cavalry in the van and his hoplites in the rear. These\r\nlatter covered his line, and were able to stem the attack of the enemy,\r\nand accordingly the disaster was less than it would otherwise have\r\nbeen. As it was, however, a large number of beasts of burden and horses\r\nperished; for the advantage of the higher ground being with the enemy,\r\nthe Gauls moved along the slopes parallel with the army below, and by\r\nrolling down boulders, or throwing stones, reduced the troops to a\r\nstate of the utmost confusion and danger; so that Hannibal with half\r\nhis force was obliged to pass the night near a certain white rock,[181]\r\nwhich afforded them protection, separated from his horses and baggage\r\nwhich he was covering; until after a whole night’s struggle they slowly\r\nand with difficulty emerged from the gorge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrives at the summit.]\r\n\r\nNext morning the enemy had disappeared: and Hannibal, having effected\r\na junction with his cavalry and baggage, led his men towards the head\r\nof the pass, without falling in again with any important muster of the\r\nnatives, though he was harassed by some of them from time to time;\r\nwho seized favourable opportunities, now on his van and now on his\r\nrear, of carrying off some of his baggage. His best protection was his\r\nelephants; on whatever parts of the line they were placed the enemy\r\nnever ventured to approach, being terrified at the unwonted appearance\r\nof the animals. The ninth day’s march brought him to the head of the\r\npass: and there he encamped for two days, partly to rest his men and\r\npartly to allow stragglers to come up. Whilst they were there, many of\r\nthe horses who had taken fright and run away, and many of the beasts of\r\nburden that had got rid of their loads, unexpectedly appeared: they had\r\nfollowed the tracks of the army and now joined the camp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 9th November.]\r\n\r\n+54.+ But by this time, it being nearly the period of the setting of\r\nthe Pleiads, the snow was beginning to be thick on the heights; and\r\nseeing his men in low spirits, owing both to the fatigue they had\r\ngone through, and that which still lay before them, Hannibal called\r\nthem together and tried to cheer them by dwelling on the one possible\r\ntopic of consolation in his power, namely the view of Italy: which lay\r\nstretched out in both directions below those mountains, giving the\r\nAlps the appearance of a citadel to the whole of Italy. By pointing\r\ntherefore to the plains of the Padus, and reminding them of the\r\nfriendly welcome which awaited them from the Gauls who lived there,\r\nand at the same time indicating the direction of Rome itself, he did\r\nsomewhat to raise the drooping spirits of his men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The descent.]\r\n\r\nNext day he began the descent, in which he no longer met with any\r\nenemies, except some few secret pillagers; but from the dangerous\r\nground and the snow he lost almost as many men as on the ascent.\r\nFor the path down was narrow and precipitous, and the snow made it\r\nimpossible for the men to see where they were treading, while to\r\nstep aside from the path, or to stumble, meant being hurled down the\r\nprecipices. The troops however bore up against the fatigue, having\r\nnow grown accustomed to such hardships; but when they came to a place\r\nwhere the path was too narrow for the elephants or beasts of burden to\r\npass,—and which, narrowed before by landslips extending about a stade\r\nand a half, had recently been made more so by another landslip,—then\r\nonce more despondency and consternation fell upon the troops.\r\nHannibal’s first idea was to avoid this _mauvais pas_ by a détour, but\r\nthis route too being made impossible by a snow-storm, he abandoned the\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A break in the road.]\r\n\r\n+55.+ The effect of the storm was peculiar and extraordinary. For\r\nthe present fall of snow coming upon the top of that which was there\r\nbefore, and had remained from the last winter, it was found that the\r\nformer, being fresh, was soft and offered no resistance to the foot;\r\nbut when the feet reached the lower frozen snow, they could no longer\r\nmake any impression upon it, but the men found both their feet slipping\r\nfrom under them, as though they were on hard ground with a layer of mud\r\non the top. And a still more serious difficulty followed: for not being\r\nable to get a foothold on the lower snow, when they fell and tried to\r\nget themselves up by their hands and knees, the men found themselves\r\nplunging downwards quicker and quicker, along with everything they laid\r\nhold of, the ground being a very steep decline. The beasts, however,\r\nwhen they fell did break through this lower snow as they struggled to\r\nrise, and having done so were obliged to remain there with their loads,\r\nas though they were frozen to it, both from the weight of these loads\r\nand the hardness of the old snow. Giving up, therefore, all hope of\r\nmaking this détour, he encamped upon the ridge after clearing away the\r\nsnow upon it. He then set large parties of his men to work, and, with\r\ninfinite toil, began constructing a road on the face of the precipice.\r\nOne day’s work sufficed to make a path practicable for beasts of burden\r\nand horses; and he accordingly took them across at once, and having\r\npitched his camp at a spot below the snow line, he let them go in\r\nsearch of pasture; while he told off the Numidians in detachments to\r\nproceed with the making of the road; and after three days’ difficult\r\nand painful labour he got his elephants across, though in a miserable\r\ncondition from hunger. For the tops of the Alps, and the parts\r\nimmediately below them, are completely treeless and bare of vegetation,\r\nbecause the snow lies there summer and winter; but about half-way down\r\nthe slopes on both sides they produce trees and shrubs, and are, in\r\nfact, fit for human habitation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He reaches the plains.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ So Hannibal mustered his forces and continued the descent; and\r\non the third day after passing the precipitous path just described he\r\nreached the plains. From the beginning of his march he had lost many\r\nmen by the hands of the enemy, and in crossing rivers, and many more\r\non the precipices and dangerous passes of the Alps; and not only men\r\nin this last way, but horses and beasts of burden in still greater\r\nnumbers. The whole march from New Carthage had occupied five months,\r\nthe actual passage of the Alps fifteen days; and he now boldly entered\r\nthe valley of the Padus, and the territory of the Insubres, with such\r\nof his army as survived, consisting of twelve thousand Libyans and\r\neight thousand Iberians, and not more than six thousand cavalry in all,\r\nas he himself distinctly states on the column erected on the promontory\r\nof Lacinium to record the numbers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, as I have before stated, Publius having left his\r\nlegions under the command of his brother Gnaeus, with orders to\r\nprosecute the Iberian campaign and offer an energetic resistance to\r\nHasdrubal, landed at Pisae with a small body of men. Thence he marched\r\nthrough Etruria, and taking over the army of the Praetors which was\r\nguarding the country against the Boii, he arrived in the valley of the\r\nPadus; and, pitching his camp there, waited for the enemy with an eager\r\ndesire to give him battle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Digression on the limits of history.]\r\n\r\n+57.+ Having thus brought the generals of the two nations and the war\r\nitself into Italy, before beginning the campaign, I wish to say a few\r\nwords about what I conceive to be germane or not to my history.\r\n\r\nI can conceive some readers complaining that, while devoting a great\r\ndeal of space to Libya and Iberia, I have said little or nothing\r\nabout the strait of the Pillars of Hercules, the Mare Externum, or\r\nthe British Isles, and the manufacture of tin in them, or even of the\r\nsilver and gold mines in Iberia itself, of which historians give long\r\nand contradictory accounts. It was not, let me say, because I thought\r\nthese subjects out of place in history that I passed them over; but\r\nbecause, in the first place, I did not wish to be diffuse, or distract\r\nthe attention of students from the main current of my narrative; and,\r\nin the next place, because I was determined not to treat of them in\r\nscattered notices or casual allusions, but to assign them a distinct\r\ntime and place, and at these, to the best of my ability, to give a\r\ntrustworthy account of them. On the same principle I must deprecate\r\nany feeling of surprise if, in the succeeding portions of my history,\r\nI pass over other similar topics, which might seem naturally in place,\r\nfor the same reasons. Those who ask for dissertations in history on\r\nevery possible subject, are somewhat like greedy guests at a banquet,\r\nwho, by tasting every dish on the table, fail to really enjoy any\r\none of them at the time, or to digest and feel any benefit from them\r\nafterwards. Such omnivorous readers get no real pleasure in the\r\npresent, and no adequate instruction for the future.\r\n\r\n+58.+ There can be no clearer proof, than is afforded by these\r\nparticular instances, that this department of historical writing stands\r\nabove all others in need of study and correction. For as all, or at\r\nleast the greater number of writers, have endeavoured to describe the\r\npeculiar features and positions of the countries on the confines of\r\nthe known world, and in doing so have, in most cases, made egregious\r\nmistakes, it is impossible to pass over their errors without some\r\nattempt at refutation; and that not in scattered observations or casual\r\nremarks, but deliberately and formally. But such confutation should\r\nnot take the form of accusation or invective. While correcting their\r\nmistakes we should praise the writers, feeling sure that, had they\r\nlived to the present age, they would have altered and corrected many of\r\ntheir statements. The fact is that, in past ages, we know of very few\r\nGreeks who undertook to investigate these remote regions, owing to the\r\ninsuperable difficulties of the attempt. The dangers at sea were then\r\nmore than can easily be calculated, and those on land more numerous\r\nstill. And even if one did reach these countries on the confines of the\r\nworld, whether compulsorily or voluntarily, the difficulties in the way\r\nof a personal inspection were only begun: for some of the regions were\r\nutterly barbarous, others uninhabited; and a still greater obstacle\r\nin way of gaining information as to what he saw was his ignorance\r\nof the language of the country. And even if he learnt this, a still\r\ngreater difficulty was to preserve a strict moderation in his account\r\nof what he had seen, and despising all attempts to glorify himself by\r\ntraveller’s tales of wonder, to report for our benefit the truth and\r\nnothing but the truth.\r\n\r\n+59.+ All these impediments made a true account of these regions in\r\npast times difficult, if not impossible. Nor ought we to criticise\r\nseverely the omissions or mistakes of these writers: rather they\r\ndeserve our praise and admiration for having in such an age gained\r\ninformation as to these places, which distinctly advanced knowledge.\r\nIn our own age, however, the Asiatic districts have been opened up\r\nboth by sea and land owing to the empire of Alexander, and the other\r\nplaces owing to the supremacy of Rome. Men too of practical experience\r\nin affairs, being released from the cares of martial or political\r\nambition, have thereby had excellent opportunities for research and\r\ninquiry into these localities; and therefore it will be but right\r\nfor us to have a better and truer knowledge of what was formerly\r\nunknown. And this I shall endeavour to establish, when I find a fitting\r\nopportunity in the course of my history. I shall be especially anxious\r\nto give the curious a full knowledge on these points, because it was\r\nwith that express object that I confronted the dangers and fatigues\r\nof my travels in Libya, Iberia, and Gaul, as well as of the sea which\r\nwashes the western coasts of these countries; that I might correct the\r\nimperfect knowledge of former writers, and make the Greeks acquainted\r\nwith these parts of the known world.\r\n\r\nAfter this digression, I must go back to the pitched battles between\r\nthe Romans and Carthaginians in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rest and recovery.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taking of Turin.]\r\n\r\n+60.+ After arriving in Italy with the number of troops which I have\r\nalready stated, Hannibal pitched his camp at the very foot of the Alps,\r\nand was occupied, to begin with, in refreshing his men. For not only\r\nhad his whole army suffered terribly from the difficulties of transit\r\nin the ascent, and still more in the descent of the Alps, but it was\r\nalso in evil case from the shortness of provisions, and the inevitable\r\nneglect of all proper attention to physical necessities. Many had quite\r\nabandoned all care for their health under the influence of starvation\r\nand continuous fatigue; for it had proved impossible to carry a full\r\nsupply of food for so many thousands over such mountains, and what they\r\ndid bring was in great part lost along with the beasts that carried it.\r\nSo that whereas, when Hannibal crossed the Rhone, he had thirty-eight\r\nthousand infantry, and more than eight thousand cavalry, he lost\r\nnearly half in the pass, as I have shown above; while the survivors\r\nhad by these long continued sufferings become almost savage in look\r\nand general appearance. Hannibal therefore bent his whole energies to\r\nthe restoration of the spirits and bodies of his men, and of their\r\nhorses also. When his army had thus sufficiently recovered, finding\r\nthe Taurini, who live immediately under the Alps, at war with the\r\nInsubres and inclined to be suspicious of the Carthaginians, Hannibal\r\nfirst invited them to terms of friendship and alliance; and, on their\r\nrefusal, invested their chief city and carried it after a three day’s\r\nsiege. Having put to the sword all who had opposed him, he struck such\r\nterror into the minds of the neighbouring tribes, that they all gave in\r\ntheir submission out of hand. The other Celts inhabiting these plains\r\nwere also eager to join the Carthaginians, according to their original\r\npurpose; but the Roman legions had by this time advanced too far, and\r\nhad intercepted the greater part of them: they were therefore unable to\r\nstir, and in some cases were even obliged to serve in the Roman ranks.\r\nThis determined Hannibal not to delay his advance any longer, but to\r\nstrike some blow which might encourage those natives who were desirous\r\nof sharing his enterprise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Approach of Scipio.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius Sempronius recalled.]\r\n\r\n+61.+ When he heard, while engaged on this design, that Publius had\r\nalready crossed the Padus with his army, and was at no great distance,\r\nhe was at first inclined to disbelieve the fact, reflecting that it was\r\nnot many days since he had left him near the passage of the Rhone, and\r\nthat the voyage from Marseilles to Etruria was a long and difficult\r\none. He was told, moreover, that from the Tyrrhenian Sea to the Alps\r\nthrough Italian soil was a long march, without good military roads.\r\nBut when messenger after messenger confirmed the intelligence with\r\nincreased positiveness, he was filled with amazement and admiration\r\nat the Consul’s plan of campaign, and promptness in carrying it out.\r\nThe feelings of Publius were much the same: for he had not expected\r\nthat Hannibal would even attempt the passage of the Alps with forces\r\nof different races, or, if he did attempt it, that he could escape\r\nutter destruction. Entertaining such ideas he was immensely astonished\r\nat his courage and adventurous daring, when he heard that he had not\r\nonly got safe across, but was actually besieging certain towns in\r\nItaly. Similar feelings were entertained at Rome when the news arrived\r\nthere. For scarcely had the last rumour about the taking of Saguntum\r\nby the Carthaginians ceased to attract attention, and scarcely had\r\nthe measures adopted in view of that event been taken,—namely the\r\ndespatch of one Consul to Libya to besiege Carthage, and of the other\r\nto Iberia to meet Hannibal there,—than news came that Hannibal had\r\narrived in Italy with his army, and was already besieging certain towns\r\nin it. Thrown into great alarm by this unexpected turn of affairs, the\r\nRoman government sent at once to Tiberius at Lilybaeum, telling him\r\nof the presence of the enemy in Italy, and ordering him to abandon\r\nthe original design of his expedition, and to make all haste home to\r\nreinforce the defences of the country. Tiberius at once collected\r\nthe men of the fleet and sent them off, with orders to go home by\r\nsea; while he caused the Tribunes to administer an oath to the men of\r\nthe legions that they would all appear at a fixed day at Ariminum by\r\nbedtime. Ariminum is a town on the Adriatic, situated at the southern\r\nboundary of the valley of the Padus. In every direction there was stir\r\nand excitement: and the news being a complete surprise to everybody,\r\nthere was everywhere a great and irrepressible anxiety as to the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gallic prisoners.]\r\n\r\n+62.+ The two armies being now within a short distance of each other,\r\nHannibal and Publius both thought it necessary to address their men in\r\nterms suitable to the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Hannibal tried to encourage his army was this. He\r\nmustered the men, and caused some youthful prisoners whom he had caught\r\nwhen they were attempting to hinder his march on the Alpine passes, to\r\nbe brought forward. They had been subjected to great severities with\r\nthis very object, loaded with heavy chains, half-starved, and their\r\nbodies a mass of bruises from scourging. Hannibal caused these men to\r\nbe placed in the middle of the army, and some suits of Gallic armour,\r\nsuch as are worn by their kings when they fight in single combat, to\r\nbe exhibited; in addition to these he placed there some horses, and\r\nbrought in some valuable military cloaks. He then asked these young\r\nprisoners, which of them were willing to fight with each other on\r\ncondition of the conqueror taking these prizes, and the vanquished\r\nescaping all his present miseries by death. Upon their all answering\r\nwith a loud shout that they were desirous of fighting in these single\r\ncombats, he bade them draw lots; and the pair, on whom the first lot\r\nfell, to put on the armour and fight with each other. As soon as the\r\nyoung men heard these orders, they lifted up their hands, and each\r\nprayed the gods that he might be one of those to draw the lot. And\r\nwhen the lots were drawn, those on whom they fell were overjoyed,\r\nand the others in despair. When the fight was finished, too, the\r\nsurviving captives congratulated the one who had fallen no less than\r\nthe victor, as having been freed from many terrible sufferings, while\r\nthey themselves still remained to endure them. And in this feeling\r\nthe Carthaginian soldiers were much disposed to join, all pitying the\r\nsurvivors and congratulating the fallen champion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s speech.]\r\n\r\n+63.+ Having by this example made the impression he desired upon the\r\nminds of his troops, Hannibal then came forward himself and said, “that\r\nhe had exhibited these captives in order that they might see in the\r\nperson of others a vivid representation of what they had to expect\r\nthemselves, and might so lay their plans all the better in view of the\r\nactual state of affairs. Fortune had summoned them to a life and death\r\ncontest very like that of the two captives, and in which the prize of\r\nvictory was the same. For they must either conquer, or die, or fall\r\nalive into the hands of their enemies; and the prize of victory would\r\nnot be mere horses and military cloaks, but the most enviable position\r\nin the world if they became masters of the wealth of Rome: or if they\r\nfell in battle their reward would be to end their life fighting to\r\ntheir last breath for the noblest object, in the heat of the struggle,\r\nand with no sense of pain; while if they were beaten, or from desire\r\nof life were base enough to fly, or tried to prolong that life by\r\nany means except victory, every sort of misery and misfortune would\r\nbe their lot: for it was impossible that any one of them could be so\r\nirrational or senseless, when he remembered the length of the journey\r\nhe had performed from his native land, and the number of enemies that\r\nlay between him and it, and the size of the rivers he had crossed, as\r\nto cherish the hope of being able to reach his home by flight. They\r\nshould therefore cast away such vain hopes, and regard their position\r\nas being exactly that of the combatants whom they had but now been\r\nwatching. For, as in their case, all congratulated the dead as much as\r\nthe victor, and commiserated the survivors; so they should think of\r\nthe alternatives before themselves, and should, one and all, come upon\r\nthe field of battle resolved, if possible, to conquer, and, if not,\r\nto die. Life with defeat was a hope that must by no means whatever be\r\nentertained. If they reasoned and resolved thus, victory and safety\r\nwould certainly attend them: for it never happened that men who came to\r\nsuch a resolution, whether of deliberate purpose or from being driven\r\nto bay, were disappointed in their hope of beating their opponents in\r\nthe field. And when it chanced, as was the case with the Romans, that\r\nthe enemy had in most cases a hope of quite an opposite character,\r\nfrom the near neighbourhood of their native country making flight an\r\nobvious means of safety, then it was clear that the courage which came\r\nof despair would carry the day.”\r\n\r\nWhen he saw that the example and the words he had spoken had gone home\r\nto the minds of the rank and file, and that the spirit and enthusiasm\r\nwhich he aimed at inspiring were created, he dismissed them for the\r\npresent with commendations, and gave orders for an advance at daybreak\r\non the next morning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scipio crosses the Ticinus.]\r\n\r\n+64.+ About the same day Publius Scipio, having now crossed the Padus,\r\nand being resolved to make a farther advance across the Ticinus,\r\nordered those who were skilled in such works to construct a bridge\r\nacross this latter river; and then summoned a meeting of the remainder\r\nof his army and addressed them: dwelling principally on the reputation\r\nof their country and of the ancestors’ achievements. But he referred\r\nparticularly to their present position, saying, “that they ought to\r\nentertain no doubt of victory, though they had never as yet had any\r\nexperience of the enemy; and should regard it as a piece of extravagant\r\npresumption of the Carthaginians to venture to face Romans, by whom\r\nthey had been so often beaten, and to whom they had for so many years\r\npaid tribute and been all but slaves. And when in addition to this they\r\nat present knew thus much of their mettle,—that they dared not face\r\nthem, what was the fair inference to be drawn for the future? Their\r\ncavalry, in a chance encounter on the Rhone with those of Rome, had,\r\nso far from coming off well, lost a large number of men, and had fled\r\nwith disgrace to their own camp; and the general and his army, as soon\r\nas they knew of the approach of his legions, had beat a retreat, which\r\nwas exceedingly like a flight, and, contrary to their original purpose,\r\nhad in their terror taken the road over the Alps. And it was evident\r\nthat Hannibal had destroyed the greater part of his army; and that what\r\nhe had left was feeble and unfit for service, from the hardships they\r\nhad undergone: in the same way he had lost the majority of his horses,\r\nand made the rest useless from the length and difficult nature of the\r\njourney. They had, therefore, only to show themselves to the enemy.”\r\nBut, above all, he pointed out that “his own presence at their head\r\nought to be special encouragement to them: for that he would not have\r\nleft his fleet and Spanish campaign, on which he had been sent, and\r\nhave come to them in such haste, if he had not seen on consideration\r\nthat his doing so was necessary for his country’s safety, and that a\r\ncertain victory was secured to him by it.”\r\n\r\nThe weight and influence of the speaker, as well as their belief\r\nin his words, roused great enthusiasm among the men; which Scipio\r\nacknowledged, and then dismissed them with the additional injunction\r\nthat they should hold themselves in readiness to obey any order sent\r\nround to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skirmish of cavalry near the Ticinus, Nov. B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n+65.+ Next day both generals led their troops along the river Padus,\r\non the bank nearest the Alps, the Romans having the stream on their\r\nleft, the Carthaginians on their right; and having ascertained on the\r\nsecond day, by means of scouts, that they were near each other, they\r\nboth halted and remained encamped for that day: but on the next, both\r\ntaking their cavalry, and Publius his sharp-shooters also, they hurried\r\nacross the plain to reconnoitre each other’s forces. As soon as they\r\ncame within distance, and saw the dust rising from the side of their\r\nopponents, they drew up their lines for battle at once. Publius put his\r\nsharp-shooters and Gallic horsemen in front, and bringing the others\r\ninto line, advanced at a slow pace. Hannibal placed his cavalry that\r\nrode with bridles, and was most to be depended on, in his front, and\r\nled them straight against the enemy; having put the Numidian cavalry on\r\neither wing to take the enemy on the flanks. The two generals and the\r\ncavalry were in such hot haste to engage, that they closed with each\r\nother before the sharp-shooters had an opportunity of discharging their\r\njavelines at all. Before they could do so, they left their ground, and\r\nretreated to the rear of their own cavalry, making their way between\r\nthe squadrons, terrified at the approaching charge, and afraid of being\r\ntrampled to death by the horses which were galloping down upon them.\r\nThe cavalry charged each other front to front, and for a long time\r\nmaintained an equal contest; and a great many men dismounting on the\r\nactual field, there was a mixed fight of horse and foot. The Numidian\r\nhorse, however, having outflanked the Romans, charged them on the rear:\r\nand so the sharp-shooters, who had fled from the cavalry charge at\r\nthe beginning, were now trampled to death by the numbers and furious\r\nonslaught of the Numidians; while the front ranks originally engaged\r\nwith the Carthaginians, after losing many of their men and inflicting a\r\nstill greater loss on the enemy, finding themselves charged on the rear\r\nby the Numidians, broke into flight: most of them scattering in every\r\ndirection, while some of them kept closely massed round the Consul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scipio retires to Placentia on the right bank of the Po.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal crosses the Po higher up and follows Scipio to\r\nPlacentia.]\r\n\r\n+66.+ Publius then broke up his camp, and marched through the plains to\r\nthe bridge over the Padus, in haste to get his legions across before\r\nthe enemy came up. He saw that the level country where he was then was\r\nfavourable to the enemy with his superiority in cavalry. He was himself\r\ndisabled by a wound;[182] and he decided that it was necessary to shift\r\nhis quarters to a place of safety. For a time Hannibal imagined that\r\nScipio would give him battle with his infantry also: but when he saw\r\nthat he had abandoned his camp, he went in pursuit of him as far as\r\nthe bridge over the Ticinus; but finding that the greater part of the\r\ntimbers of this bridge had been torn away, while the men who guarded\r\nthe bridge were left still on his side of the river, he took them\r\nprisoners to the number of about six hundred, and being informed that\r\nthe main army was far on its way, he wheeled round and again ascended\r\nthe Padus in search of a spot in it which admitted of being easily\r\nbridged. After two days’ march he halted and constructed a bridge over\r\nthe river by means of boats. He committed the task of bringing over the\r\narmy to Hasdrubal;[183] while he himself crossed at once, and busied\r\nhimself in receiving the ambassadors who arrived from the neighbouring\r\ndistricts. For no sooner had he gained the advantage in the cavalry\r\nengagement, than all the Celts in the vicinity hastened to fulfil their\r\noriginal engagement by avowing themselves his friends, supplying him\r\nwith provisions, and joining the Carthaginian forces. After giving\r\nthese men a cordial reception, and getting his own army across the\r\nPadus, he began to march back again down stream, with an earnest\r\ndesire of giving the enemy battle. Publius, too, had crossed the river\r\nand was now encamped under the walls of the Roman colony Placentia.\r\nThere he made no sign of any intention to move; for he was engaged in\r\ntrying to heal his own wound and those of his men, and considered that\r\nhe had a secure base of operations where he was. A two days’ march\r\nfrom the place where he had crossed the Padus brought Hannibal to the\r\nneighbourhood of the enemy; and on the third day he drew out his army\r\nfor battle in full view of his opponents: but as no one came out to\r\nattack, he pitched his camp about fifty stades from them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treachery of the Gauls serving in the army of Scipio.]\r\n\r\n+67.+ But the Celtic contingent of the Roman army, seeing that\r\nHannibal’s prospects looked the brighter of the two, concerted their\r\nplans for a fixed time, and waited in their several tents for the\r\nmoment of carrying them out. When the men within the rampart of the\r\ncamp had taken their supper and were gone to bed, the Celts let more\r\nthan half the night pass, and just about the time of the morning watch\r\narmed themselves and fell upon the Romans who were quartered nearest\r\nto them; killed a considerable number, and wounded not a few; and,\r\nfinally, cutting off the heads of the slain, departed with them to\r\njoin the Carthaginians, to the number of two thousand infantry and\r\nnearly two hundred cavalry. They were received with great satisfaction\r\nby Hannibal; who, after addressing them encouragingly, and promising\r\nthem all suitable rewards, sent them to their several cities, to\r\ndeclare to their compatriots what they had done, and to urge them\r\nto make alliance with him: for he knew that they would now all feel\r\ncompelled to take part with him, when they learnt the treachery of\r\nwhich their fellow-countrymen had been guilty to the Romans. Just\r\nat the same time the Boii came in, and handed over to him the three\r\nAgrarian Commissioners, sent from Rome to divide the lands; whom, as\r\nI have already related, they had seized by a sudden act of treachery\r\nat the beginning of the war. Hannibal gratefully acknowledged their\r\ngood intention, and made a formal alliance with those who came: but he\r\nhanded them back their prisoners, bidding them keep them safe, in order\r\nto get back their own hostages from Rome, as they intended at first.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scipio changes his position at Placentia to one on the\r\nTrebia.]\r\n\r\nPublius regarded this treachery as of most serious importance; and\r\nfeeling sure that the Celts in the neighbourhood had long been\r\nill-disposed, and would, after this event, all incline to the\r\nCarthaginians, he made up his mind that some precaution for the future\r\nwas necessary. The next night, therefore, just before the morning\r\nwatch, he broke up his camp and marched for the river Trebia, and the\r\nhigh ground near it, feeling confidence in the protection which the\r\nstrength of the position and the neighbourhood of his allies would give\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal follows him.]\r\n\r\n+68.+ When Hannibal was informed of Scipio’s change of quarters,\r\nhe sent the Numidian horse in pursuit at once, and the rest soon\r\nafterwards, following close behind with his main army. The Numidians,\r\nfinding the Roman camp empty, stopped to set fire to it: which proved\r\nof great service to the Romans; for if they had pushed on and caught\r\nup the Roman baggage, a large number of the rear-guard would have\r\ncertainly been killed by the cavalry in the open plains. But as it was,\r\nthe greater part of them got across the River Trebia in time; while\r\nthose who were after all too far in the rear to escape, were either\r\nkilled or made prisoners by the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scipio’s position on the slopes of Apennines, near the\r\nsource of the Trebia.]\r\n\r\nScipio, however, having crossed the Trebia occupied the first high\r\nground; and having strengthened his camp with trench and palisade,\r\nwaited the arrival of his colleague, Tiberius Sempronius, and his army;\r\nand was taking the greatest pains to cure his wound, because he was\r\nexceedingly anxious to take part in the coming engagement. Hannibal\r\npitched his camp about forty stades from him. While the numerous\r\nCelts inhabiting the plains, excited by the good prospects of the\r\nCarthaginians, supplied his army with provisions in great abundance,\r\nand were eager to take their share with Hannibal in every military\r\noperation or battle.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the cavalry engagement reached Rome, the disappointment\r\nof their confident expectations caused a feeling of consternation in\r\nthe minds of the people. Not but that plenty of pretexts were found to\r\nprove to their own satisfaction that the affair was not a defeat. Some\r\nlaid the blame on the Consul’s rashness, and others on the treacherous\r\nlukewarmness of the Celts, which they concluded from their recent\r\nrevolt must have been shown by them on the field. But, after all, as\r\nthe infantry was still unimpaired, they made up their minds that the\r\ngeneral result was still as hopeful as ever. Accordingly, when Tiberius\r\nand his legions arrived at Rome, and marched through the city, they\r\nbelieved that his mere appearance at the seat of war would settle the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tiberius Sempronius joins Scipio.]\r\n\r\nHis men met Tiberius at Ariminum, according to their oath, and he\r\nat once led them forward in all haste to join Publius Scipio. The\r\njunction effected, and a camp pitched by the side of his colleague,\r\nhe was naturally obliged to refresh his men after their forty days’\r\ncontinuous march between Ariminum and Lilybaeum: but he went on with\r\nall preparations for a battle; and was continually in conference with\r\nScipio, asking questions as to what had happened in the past, and\r\ndiscussing with him the measures to be taken in the present.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Clastidium. Hannibal’s policy towards the Italians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A skirmish favourable to the Romans.]\r\n\r\n+69.+ Meanwhile Hannibal got possession of Clastidium, by the treachery\r\nof a certain Brundisian, to whom it had been entrusted by the Romans.\r\nHaving become master of the garrison and the stores of corn he used the\r\nlatter for his present needs; but took the men whom he had captured\r\nwith him, without doing them any harm, being desirous of showing by\r\nan example the policy he meant to pursue; that those whose present\r\nposition towards Rome was merely the result of circumstances should\r\nnot be terrified, and give up hope of being spared by him. The man\r\nwho betrayed Clastidium to him he treated with extraordinary honour,\r\nby way of tempting all men in similar situations of authority to\r\nshare the prospects of the Carthaginians. But afterwards, finding\r\nthat certain Celts who lived in the fork of the Padus and the Trebia,\r\nwhile pretending to have made terms with him, were sending messages\r\nto the Romans at the same time, believing that they would thus secure\r\nthemselves from being harmed by either side, he sent two thousand\r\ninfantry with some Celtic and Numidian cavalry with orders to devastate\r\ntheir territory. This order being executed, and a great booty obtained,\r\nthe Celts appeared at the Roman camp beseeching their aid. Tiberius\r\nhad been all along looking out for an opportunity of striking a blow:\r\nand once seized on this pretext for sending out a party, consisting of\r\nthe greater part of his cavalry; and a thousand sharp-shooters of his\r\ninfantry along with them; who having speedily come up with the enemy\r\non the other side of the Trebia, and engaged them in a sharp struggle\r\nfor the possession of the booty, forced the Celts and Numidians to beat\r\na retreat to their own camp. Those who were on duty in front of the\r\nCarthaginian camp quickly perceived what was going on, and brought some\r\nreserves to support the retreating cavalry; then the Romans in their\r\nturn were routed, and had to retreat to their camp. At this Tiberius\r\nsent out all his cavalry and sharp-shooters; whereupon the Celts again\r\ngave way, and sought the protection of their own camp. The Carthaginian\r\ngeneral being unprepared for a general engagement, and thinking it a\r\nsound rule not to enter upon one on every casual opportunity, or except\r\nin accordance with a settled design, acted, it must be confessed, on\r\nthis occasion with admirable generalship. He checked their flight when\r\nhis men were near the camp, and forced them to halt and face about; but\r\nhe sent out his aides and buglers to recall the rest, and prevented\r\nthem from pursuing and engaging the enemy any more. So the Romans after\r\na short halt went back, having killed a large number of the enemy, and\r\nlost very few themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sempronius resolves to give battle.]\r\n\r\n+70.+ Excited and overjoyed at this success Tiberius was all eagerness\r\nfor a general engagement. Now, it was in his power to administer the\r\nwar for the present as he chose, owing to the ill-health of Publius\r\nScipio; yet wishing to have his colleague’s opinion in support of his\r\nown, he consulted him on this subject. Publius however took quite\r\nan opposite view of the situation. He thought his legions would be\r\nall the better for a winter under arms; and that the fidelity of the\r\nfickle Celts would never stand the test of want of success and enforced\r\ninactivity on the part of the Carthaginians: they would be certain, he\r\nthought, to turn against them once more. Besides, when he had recovered\r\nfrom his wound, he hoped to be able to do good service to his country\r\nhimself. With these arguments he tried to dissuade Tiberius from his\r\ndesign. The latter felt that every one of these arguments were true and\r\nsound; but, urged on by ambition and a blind confidence in his fortune,\r\nhe was eager to have the credit of the decisive action to himself,\r\nbefore Scipio should be able to be present at the battle, or the next\r\nConsuls arrive to take over the command; for the time for that to take\r\nplace was now approaching. As therefore he selected the time for the\r\nengagement from personal considerations, rather than with a view to the\r\nactual circumstances of the case, he was bound to make a signal failure.\r\n\r\nHannibal took much the same view of the case as Scipio, and was\r\ntherefore, unlike him, eager for a battle; because, in the first place,\r\nhe wished to avail himself of the enthusiasm of the Celts before it\r\nhad at all gone off: in the second place, he wished to engage the\r\nRoman legions while the soldiers in them were raw recruits without\r\npractice in war: and, in the third place, because he wished to fight\r\nthe battle while Scipio was still unfit for service: but most of all\r\nbecause he wanted to be doing something and not to let the time slip\r\nby fruitlessly; for when a general leads his troops into a foreign\r\ncountry, and attempts what looks like a desperate undertaking, the one\r\nchance for him is to keep the hopes of his allies alive by continually\r\nstriking some fresh blow.\r\n\r\nSuch were Hannibal’s feelings when he knew of the intended attack of\r\nTiberius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal prepares an ambuscade.]\r\n\r\n+71.+ Now he had some time before remarked a certain piece of ground\r\nwhich was flat and treeless, and yet well suited for an ambush, because\r\nthere was a stream in it with a high overhanging bank thickly covered\r\nwith thorns and brambles. Here he determined to entrap the enemy. The\r\nplace was admirably adapted for putting them off their guard; because\r\nthe Romans were always suspicious of woods, from the fact of the Celts\r\ninvariably choosing such places for their ambuscades, but felt no fear\r\nat all of places that were level and without trees: not knowing that\r\nfor the concealment and safety of an ambush such places are much better\r\nthan woods; because the men can command from them a distant view of\r\nall that is going on: while nearly all places have sufficient cover to\r\nmake concealment possible,—a stream with an overhanging bank, reeds, or\r\nferns, or some sort of bramble-bushes,—which are good enough to hide\r\nnot infantry only, but sometimes even cavalry, if the simple precaution\r\nis taken of laying conspicuous arms flat upon the ground and hiding\r\nhelmets under shields. Hannibal had confided his idea to his brother\r\nMago and to his council, who had all approved of the plan. Accordingly,\r\nwhen the army had supped, he summoned this young man to his tent, who\r\nwas full of youthful enthusiasm, and had been trained from boyhood\r\nin the art of war, and put under his command a hundred cavalry and\r\nthe same number of infantry. These men he had himself earlier in the\r\nday selected as the most powerful of the whole army, and had ordered\r\nto come to his tent after supper. Having addressed and inspired them\r\nwith the spirit suitable to the occasion, he bade each of them select\r\nten of the bravest men of their own company, and to come with them\r\nto a particular spot in the camp. The order having been obeyed, he\r\ndespatched the whole party, numbering a thousand cavalry and as many\r\ninfantry, with guides, to the place selected for the ambuscade; and\r\ngave his brother directions as to the time at which he was to make the\r\nattempt. At daybreak he himself mustered the Numidian cavalry, who were\r\nconspicuous for their powers of endurance; and after addressing them,\r\nand promising them rewards if they behaved with gallantry, he ordered\r\nthem to ride up to the enemy’s lines, and then quickly cross the river,\r\nand by throwing showers of darts at them tempt them to come out: his\r\nobject being to get at the enemy before they had had their breakfast,\r\nor made any preparations for the day. The other officers of the army\r\nalso he summoned, and gave them similar instructions for the battle,\r\nordering all their men to get breakfast and to see to their arms and\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of the Trebia, December B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s forces.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman forces.]\r\n\r\n+72.+ As soon as Tiberius saw the Numidian horse approaching, he\r\nimmediately sent out his cavalry by itself with orders to engage the\r\nenemy, and keep them in play, while he despatched after them six\r\nthousand foot armed with javelins, and got the rest of the army in\r\nmotion, with the idea that their appearance would decide the affair:\r\nfor his superiority in numbers, and his success in the cavalry skirmish\r\nof the day before, had filled him with confidence. But it was now\r\nmid-winter and the day was snowy and excessively cold, and men and\r\nhorses were marching out almost entirely without having tasted food;\r\nand accordingly, though the troops were at first in high spirits, yet\r\nwhen they had crossed the Trebia, swollen by the floods which the rain\r\nof the previous night had brought down from the high ground above the\r\ncamp, wading breast deep through the stream, they were in a wretched\r\nstate from the cold and want of food as the day wore on. While the\r\nCarthaginians on the contrary had eaten and drunk in their tents, and\r\ngot their horses ready, and were all anointing and arming themselves\r\nround the fires. Hannibal waited for the right moment to strike, and\r\nas soon as he saw that the Romans had crossed the Trebia, throwing out\r\neight thousand spearmen and slingers to cover his advance, he led out\r\nhis whole army. When he had advanced about eight stades from the camp,\r\nhe drew up his infantry, consisting of about twenty thousand Iberians,\r\nCelts, and Libyans, in one long line, while he divided his cavalry and\r\nplaced half on each wing, amounting in all to more than ten thousand,\r\ncounting the Celtic allies; his elephants also he divided between the\r\ntwo wings, where they occupied the front rank. Meanwhile Tiberius had\r\nrecalled his cavalry because he saw that they could do nothing with the\r\nenemy. For the Numidians when attacked retreated without difficulty,\r\nscattering in every direction, and then faced about again and charged,\r\nwhich is the peculiar feature of their mode of warfare. But he drew up\r\nhis infantry in the regular Roman order, consisting of sixteen thousand\r\ncitizens and twenty thousand allies; for that is the complete number\r\nof a Roman army in an important campaign, when the two Consuls are\r\ncompelled by circumstances to combine forces.[184] He then placed the\r\ncavalry on either wing, numbering four thousand, and advanced against\r\nthe enemy in gallant style, in regular order, and at a deliberate pace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman cavalry retreat.]\r\n\r\n+73.+ When the two forces came within distance, the light-armed troops\r\nin front of the two armies closed with each other. In this part of the\r\nbattle the Romans were in many respects at a disadvantage, while the\r\nCarthaginians had everything in their favour. For the Roman spearmen\r\nhad been on hard service ever since daybreak, and had expended most of\r\ntheir weapons in the engagement with the Numidians, while those weapons\r\nwhich were left had become useless from being long wet. Nor were the\r\ncavalry, or indeed the whole army, any better off in these respects.\r\nThe case of the Carthaginians was exactly the reverse: they had come on\r\nthe field perfectly sound and fresh, and were ready and eager for every\r\nservice required of them. As soon, therefore, as their advanced guard\r\nhad retired again within their lines, and the heavy-armed soldiers\r\nwere engaged, the cavalry on the two wings of the Carthaginian army at\r\nonce charged the enemy with all the effect of superiority in numbers,\r\nand in the condition both of men and horses secured by their freshness\r\nwhen they started. The Roman cavalry on the contrary retreated: and\r\nthe flanks of the line being thus left unprotected, the Carthaginian\r\nspearmen and the main body of the Numidians, passing their own advanced\r\nguard, charged the Roman flanks: and, by the damage which they did\r\nthem, prevented them from keeping up the fight with the troops on their\r\nfront. The heavy-armed soldiers, however, who were in the front rank\r\nof both armies, and in the centre of that, maintained an obstinate and\r\nequal fight for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Both Roman wings defeated.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman centre fights its way to Placentia.]\r\n\r\n+74.+ Just then the Numidians, who had been lying in ambush, left their\r\nhiding-place, and by a sudden charge on the centre of the Roman rear\r\nproduced great confusion and alarm throughout the army. Finally both\r\nthe Roman wings, being hard pressed in front by the elephants, and on\r\nboth flanks by the light-armed troops of the enemy, gave way, and in\r\ntheir flight were forced upon the river behind them. After this, while\r\nthe centre of the Roman rear was losing heavily, and suffering severely\r\nfrom the attack of the Numidian ambuscade, their front, thus driven to\r\nbay, defeated the Celts and a division of Africans, and, after killing\r\na large number of them, succeeded in cutting their way through the\r\nCarthaginian line. Then seeing that their wings had been forced off\r\ntheir ground, they gave up all hope of relieving them or getting back\r\nto their camp, partly because of the number of the enemy’s cavalry, and\r\npartly because they were hindered by the river and the pelting storm\r\nof rain which was pouring down upon their heads. They therefore closed\r\ntheir ranks, and made their way safely to Placentia, to the number of\r\nten thousand. Of the rest of the army the greater number were killed\r\nby the elephants and cavalry on the bank of the Trebia; while those of\r\nthe infantry who escaped, and the greater part of the cavalry, managed\r\nto rejoin the ten thousand mentioned above, and arrived with them at\r\nPlacentia. Meanwhile the Carthaginian army pursued the enemy as far\r\nas the Trebia; but being prevented by the storm from going farther,\r\nreturned to their camp. They regarded the result of the battle with\r\ngreat exultation, as a complete success; for the loss of the Iberians\r\nand Africans had been light, the heaviest having fallen on the Celts.\r\nBut from the rain and the snow which followed it, they suffered so\r\nseverely, that all the elephants except one died, and a large number of\r\nmen and horses perished from the cold.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter of B.C. 118-117. Great exertions at Rome to meet the\r\ndanger.]\r\n\r\n+75.+ Fully aware of the nature of his disaster, but wishing to conceal\r\nits extent as well as he could from the people at home, Tiberius sent\r\nmessengers to announce that a battle had taken place, but that the\r\nstorm had deprived them of the victory. For the moment this news was\r\nbelieved at Rome; but when soon afterwards it became known that the\r\nCarthaginians were in possession of the Roman camp, and that all the\r\nCelts had joined them: while their own troops had abandoned their\r\ncamp, and, after retiring from the field of battle, were all collected\r\nin the neighbouring cities; and were besides being supplied with\r\nnecessary provisions by sea up the Padus, the Roman people became\r\nonly too certain of what had really happened in the battle. It was a\r\nmost unexpected reverse, and it forced them at once to urge on with\r\nenergy the remaining preparations for the war. They reinforced those\r\npositions which lay in the way of the enemy’s advance; sent legions\r\nto Sardinia and Sicily, as well as garrisons to Tarentum, and other\r\nplaces of strategical importance; and, moreover, fitted out a fleet\r\nof sixty quinqueremes. The Consuls designate, Gnaeus Servilius and\r\nGaius Flaminius, were collecting the allies and enrolling the citizen\r\nlegions, and sending supplies to Ariminum and Etruria, with a view\r\nof going to the seat of war by those two routes. They sent also to\r\nking Hiero asking for reinforcements, who sent them five hundred\r\nCretan archers and a thousand peltasts. In fact they pushed on their\r\npreparations in every direction with energy. For the Roman people are\r\nmost formidable, collectively and individually, when they have real\r\nreason for alarm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gnaeus Scipio in Spain.]\r\n\r\n+76.+ While these events were happening in Italy, Gnaeus Cornelius\r\nScipio, who had been left by his brother Publius in command of the\r\nfleet, setting sail from the mouth of the Rhone, came to land with his\r\nwhole squadron at a place in Iberia called Emporium. Starting from this\r\ntown, he made descents upon the coast, landing and besieging those who\r\nrefused to submit to him along the seaboard as far as the Iber; and\r\ntreating with every mark of kindness those who acceded to his demands,\r\nand taking all the precautions he could for their safety. When he had\r\ngarrisoned those towns on the coast that submitted, he led his whole\r\narmy inland, having by this time a not inconsiderable contingent of\r\nIberian allies; and took possession of the towns on his line of march,\r\nsome by negotiation and some by force of arms. The Carthaginian troops\r\nwhich Hannibal had left in that district under the command of Hanno,\r\nlay entrenched to resist him under the walls of a town called Cissa.\r\n\r\nDefeating this army in a pitched battle, Gnaeus not only got possession\r\nof a rich booty, for the whole baggage of the army invading Italy had\r\nbeen left under its charge, but secured the friendly alliance of all\r\nthe Iberian tribes north of the Iber, and took both Hanno, the general\r\nof the Carthaginians, and Andobales, the general of the Iberians,\r\nprisoners. The latter was despot of central Iberia, and had always been\r\nespecially inclined to the side of Carthage.\r\n\r\nImmediately he learnt what had happened, Hasdrubal crossed the Iber to\r\nbring aid. There he ascertained that the Roman troops left in charge\r\nof the fleet had abandoned all precautions, and were trading on the\r\nsuccess of the land forces to pass their time in ease. He therefore\r\ntook with him eight thousand infantry and one thousand cavalry of his\r\nown army, and finding the men of the fleet scattered about the country,\r\nhe killed a great many of them and forced the rest to fly for refuge\r\nto their ships. He then retired across the Iber again, and employed\r\nhimself in fortifying and garrisoning the posts south of the river,\r\ntaking up his winter quarters at New Carthage. When Gnaeus rejoined his\r\nfleet, he punished the authors of the disaster according to the Roman\r\ncustom; and then collected his land and sea forces together in Tarraco,\r\nand there took up his winter quarters; and by dividing the booty\r\nequally between his soldiers, inspired them at once with affection\r\ntowards himself and eagerness for future service. Such was the course\r\nof the Iberian campaign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+77.+ At the beginning of the following spring, Gaius Flaminius marched\r\nhis army through Etruria, and pitched his camp at Arretium; while his\r\ncolleague Gnaeus Servilius on the other hand went to Ariminum, to await\r\nthe advance of the enemy in that direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal conciliates the Italians.]\r\n\r\nPassing the winter in the Celtic territory, Hannibal kept his Roman\r\nprisoners in close confinement, supplying them very sparingly with\r\nfood; while he treated their allies with great kindness from the first,\r\nand finally called them together and addressed them, alleging, “that he\r\nhad not come to fight against them, but against Rome in their behalf;\r\nand that, therefore, if they were wise, they would attach themselves\r\nto him: because he had come to restore freedom to the Italians, and\r\nto assist them to recover their cities and territory which they had\r\nseverally lost to Rome.” With these words he dismissed them without\r\nransom to their own homes: wishing by this policy to attract the\r\ninhabitants of Italy to his cause, and to alienate their affections\r\nfrom Rome, and to awaken the resentment of all those who considered\r\nthemselves to have suffered by the loss of harbours or cities under the\r\nRoman rule.\r\n\r\n+78.+ While he was in these winter quarters also he practised a ruse\r\ntruly Punic. Being apprehensive that from the fickleness of their\r\ncharacter, and the newness of the tie between himself and them, the\r\nCelts might lay plots against his life, he caused a number of wigs\r\nto be made for him, suited in appearance to men of various ages; and\r\nthese he constantly varied, changing at the same time his clothes also\r\nto harmonise with the particular wig which he wore. He thus made it\r\nhard to recognise him, not only for those who met him suddenly, but\r\neven for his intimates. But seeing that the Celts were discontented at\r\nthe lengthened continuance of the war within their borders, and were\r\nin a state of restless hurry to invade the enemy’s territory,—on the\r\npretence of hatred for Rome, but in reality from love of booty,—he\r\ndetermined to break up his camp as soon as possible, and satisfy the\r\ndesires of his army. Accordingly as soon as the change of season set\r\nin, by questioning those who were reputed to know the country best, he\r\nascertained that the other roads leading into Etruria were long and\r\nwell known to the enemy, but that the one which led through the marshes\r\nwas short, and would bring them upon Flaminius as a surprise.[185] This\r\nwas what suited his peculiar genius, and he therefore decided to take\r\nthis route. But when the report was spread in his army that the general\r\nwas going to lead them through some marshes, every soldier felt alarmed\r\nat the idea of the quagmires and deep sloughs which they would find on\r\nthis march.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal starts for Etruria. Spring of B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+79.+ But after a careful inquiry as to what part of the road was\r\nfirm or boggy, Hannibal broke up his camp and marched out. He placed\r\nthe Libyans and Iberians and all his best soldiers in the van,\r\nand the baggage within their lines, that there might be plenty of\r\nprovisions for their immediate needs. Provisions for the future he\r\nentirely neglected. Because he calculated that on reaching the enemy’s\r\nterritory, if he were beaten he should not require them, and if he were\r\nvictorious he would find abundance in the open country. Behind this\r\nvanguard he placed the Celts, and in the rear of all the cavalry. He\r\nentrusted the command of the rear-guard to his brother Mago, that he\r\nmight see to the security of all, and especially to guard against the\r\ncowardice and impatience of hard labour which characterised the Celts;\r\nin order that, if the difficulty of the route should induce them to\r\nturn back, he might intercept them by means of the cavalry and force\r\nthem to proceed. In point of fact, the Iberians and Libyans, having\r\ngreat powers of endurance and being habituated to such fatigues, and\r\nalso because when they marched through them the marshes[186] were\r\nfresh and untrodden, accomplished their march with a moderate amount\r\nof distress: but the Celts advanced with great difficulty, because the\r\nmarshes were now disturbed and trodden into a deep morass: and being\r\nquite unaccustomed to such painful labours, they bore the fatigue\r\nwith anger and impatience; but were hindered from turning back by the\r\ncavalry in their rear. All however suffered grievously, especially\r\nfrom the impossibility of getting sleep on a continuous march of four\r\ndays and three nights through a route which was under water: but none\r\nsuffered so much, or lost so many men, as the Celts. Most of his\r\nbeasts of burden also slipping in the mud fell and perished, and could\r\nthen only do the men one service: they sat upon their dead bodies,\r\nand piling up baggage upon them so as to stand out above the water,\r\nthey managed to get a snatch of sleep[187] for a short portion of the\r\nnight. Another misfortune was that a considerable number of the horses\r\nlost their hoofs by the prolonged march through bog. Hannibal himself\r\nwas with difficulty and much suffering got across riding on the only\r\nelephant left alive, enduring great agony from a severe attack of\r\nophthalmia, by which he eventually lost the sight of one eye, because\r\nthe time and the difficulties of the situation did not admit of his\r\nwaiting or applying any treatment to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal in the valley of the Arno.]\r\n\r\n+80.+ Having crossed the marshes in this unexpected manner, Hannibal\r\nfound Flaminius in Etruria encamped under the walls of Arretium. For\r\nthe present he pitched his camp close to the marshes, to refresh his\r\narmy, and to investigate the plans of his enemies and the lie of the\r\ncountry in his front. And being informed that the country before him\r\nabounded in wealth, and that Flaminius was a mere mob-orator and\r\ndemagogue, with no ability for the actual conduct of military affairs,\r\nand was moreover unreasonably confident in his resources; he calculated\r\nthat, if he passed his camp and made a descent into the district\r\nbeyond, partly for fear of popular reproach and partly from a personal\r\nfeeling of irritation, Flaminius would be unable to endure to watch\r\npassively the devastation of the country, and would spontaneously\r\nfollow him wherever he went; and being eager to secure the credit of a\r\nvictory for himself, without waiting for the arrival of his colleague,\r\nwould give him many opportunities for an attack.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal correctly judges the character of Flaminius.]\r\n\r\n+81.+ And in making these calculations Hannibal showed his consummate\r\nprudence and strategical ability. For it is mere blind ignorance to\r\nbelieve that there can be anything of more vital importance to a\r\ngeneral than the knowledge of his opponent’s character and disposition.\r\nAs in combats between individuals or ranks, he who would conquer must\r\nobserve carefully how it is possible to attain his object, and what\r\npart of his enemy appears unguarded or insufficiently armed,—so must\r\na commander of an army look out for the weak place, not in the body,\r\nbut in the mind of the leader of the hostile force. For it has often\r\nhappened before now that from mere idleness and lack of energy, men\r\nhave let not only the welfare of the state, but even their private\r\nfortunes fall to ruin: some are so addicted to wine that they cannot\r\nsleep without bemusing their intellects with drink; and others so\r\ninfatuated in their pursuit of sensual pleasures, that they have not\r\nonly been the ruin of their cities and fortunes, but have forfeited\r\nlife itself with disgrace. In the case of individuals, however,\r\ncowardice and sloth bring shame only on themselves; but when it is a\r\ncommander-in-chief that is concerned, the disaster affects all alike\r\nand is of the most fatal consequence. It not only infects the men under\r\nhim with an inactivity like his own; but it often brings absolute\r\ndangers of the most serious description upon those who trust such a\r\ngeneral. For rashness, temerity, and uncalculating impetuosity, as well\r\nas foolish ambition and vanity, give an easy victory to the enemy.\r\nAnd are the source of numerous dangers to one’s friends: for a man\r\nwho is the prey of such weaknesses falls the easiest victim to every\r\nstratagem, ambush or ruse. The general then who can gain a clear idea\r\nof his opponent’s weaknesses, and direct his attack on the point where\r\nhe is most open to it, will very soon be the victor in the campaign.\r\nFor as a ship, if you deprive it of its steerer, falls with all its\r\ncrew into the hands of the enemy; so, in the case of an army in war, if\r\nyou outwit or out-manœuvre its general, the whole will often fall into\r\nyour hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flaminius is drawn out of camp.]\r\n\r\n+82.+ Nor was Hannibal mistaken in his calculations in regard to\r\nFlaminius. For no sooner had he left the neighbourhood of Faesulae,\r\nand, advancing a short way beyond the Roman camp, made a raid upon\r\nthe neighbouring country, than Flaminius became excited, and enraged\r\nat the idea that he was despised by the enemy: and as the devastation\r\nof the country went on, and he saw from the smoke that rose in every\r\ndirection that the work of destruction was proceeding, he could not\r\npatiently endure the sight. Some of his officers advised that they\r\nshould not follow the enemy at once nor engage him, but should act\r\non the defensive, in view of his great superiority in cavalry; and\r\nespecially that they should wait for the other Consul, and not give\r\nbattle until the two armies were combined. But Flaminius, far from\r\nlistening to their advice, was indignant at those who offered it; and\r\nbade them consider what the people at home would say at the country\r\nbeing laid waste almost up to the walls of Rome itself, while they\r\nremained encamped in Etruria on the enemy’s rear. Finally, with these\r\nwords, he set his army in motion, without any settled plan of time or\r\nplace; but bent only on falling in with the enemy, as though certain\r\nvictory awaited him. For he had managed to inspire the people with such\r\nconfident expectations, that the unarmed citizens who followed his camp\r\nin hope of booty, bringing chains and fetters and all such gear, were\r\nmore numerous than the soldiers themselves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hannibal was advancing on his way to Rome through Etruria,\r\nkeeping the city of Cortona and its hills on his left, and the\r\nThrasymene lake on his right; and as he marched, he burned and\r\nwasted the country with a view of rousing the wrath of the enemy and\r\ntempting him to come out. And when he saw Flaminius get well within\r\ndistance, and observed that the ground he then occupied was suited to\r\nhis purpose, he bent his whole energies on preparing for a general\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ambuscade at Lake Thrasymene.]\r\n\r\n+83.+ The route which he was following led through a low valley\r\nenclosed on both sides by long lines of lofty hills. Of its two ends,\r\nthat in front was blocked by an abrupt and inaccessible hill, and that\r\non the rear by the lake, between which and the foot of the cliff there\r\nis only a very narrow defile leading into this valley. Making his way\r\nto the end of the valley along the bank of the lake, Hannibal posted\r\nhimself with the Spanish and Libyan troops on the hill immediately in\r\nfront of him as he marched, and pitched a camp on it; but sent his\r\nBalearic slingers and light-armed troops by a détour, and stationed\r\nthem in extended order under the cover of the hills to the right of the\r\nvalley; and by a similar détour placed the Gauls and cavalry under the\r\ncover of hills to the left, causing them also to extend their line so\r\nfar as to cover the entrance of the defile running between the cliff\r\nand lake into the valley.[188]\r\n\r\nHaving made these preparations during the night, and having thus\r\nenclosed the valley with ambuscades, Hannibal remained quiet. In\r\npursuit of him came Flaminius, in hot haste to close with the enemy. It\r\nwas late in the evening before he pitched his camp on the border of the\r\nlake; and at daybreak next morning, just before the morning watch, he\r\nled his front maniples forward along the borders of the lake into the\r\nvalley with a view of engaging the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle, 22d June.]\r\n\r\n+84.+ The day was exceedingly misty: and as soon as the greater part\r\nof the Roman line was in the valley, and the leading maniples were\r\ngetting close to him, Hannibal gave the signal for attack; and at the\r\nsame time sent orders to the troops lying in ambush on the hills to do\r\nthe same, and thus delivered an assault upon the enemy at every point\r\nat once. Flaminius was taken completely by surprise: the mist was so\r\nthick, and the enemy were charging down from the upper ground at so\r\nmany points at once, that not only were the Centurions and Tribunes\r\nunable to relieve any part of the line that was in difficulties, but\r\nwere not even able to get any clear idea of what was going on: for\r\nthey were attacked simultaneously on front, rear, and both flanks.\r\nThe result was that most of them were cut down in the order of march,\r\nwithout being able to defend themselves: exactly as though they had\r\nbeen actually given up to slaughter by the folly of their leader.\r\nFlaminius himself, in a state of the utmost distress and despair,\r\nwas attacked and killed by a company of Celts. As many as fifteen\r\nthousand Romans fell in the valley, who could neither yield nor defend\r\nthemselves, being habituated to regard it as their supreme duty not\r\nto fly or quit their ranks. But those who were caught in the defile\r\nbetween the lake and the cliff perished in a shameful, or rather a\r\nmost miserable, manner: for being thrust into the lake, some in their\r\nfrantic terror endeavoured to swim with their armour on, and presently\r\nsank and were drowned; while the greater number, wading as far as they\r\ncould into the lake, remained there with their heads above water; and\r\nwhen the cavalry rode in after them, and certain death stared them in\r\nthe face, they raised their hands and begged for quarter, offering to\r\nsurrender, and using every imaginary appeal for mercy; but were finally\r\ndespatched by the enemy, or, in some cases, begged the favour of the\r\nfatal blow from their friends, or inflicted it on themselves. A number\r\nof men, however, amounting perhaps to six thousand, who were in the\r\nvalley, defeated the enemy immediately in front of them; but though\r\nthey might have done much to retrieve the fortune of the day, they\r\nwere unable to go to the relief of their comrades, or get to the rear\r\nof their opponents, because they could not see what was going on. They\r\naccordingly pushed on continually to the front, always expecting to\r\nfind themselves engaged with some of the enemy: until they discovered\r\nthat, without noticing it, they were issuing upon the higher ground.\r\nBut when they were on the crest of the hills, the mist broke and they\r\nsaw clearly the disaster which had befallen them; and being no longer\r\nable to do any good, since the enemy was victorious all along the line,\r\nand in complete possession of the ground, they closed their ranks and\r\nmade for a certain Etrurian village. After the battle Maharbal was sent\r\nby Hannibal with the Iberians and light-armed troops to besiege the\r\nvillage; and seeing themselves surrounded by a complication of dangers,\r\nthey laid down their arms and surrendered on condition of their lives\r\nbeing spared. Such was the end of the final engagement between the\r\nRomans and Carthaginians in Etruria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s treatment of prisoners.]\r\n\r\n+85.+ When the prisoners who had surrendered on terms were with the\r\nother prisoners brought to Hannibal, he had them all collected together\r\nto the number of more than fifteen thousand, and began by saying that\r\nMaharbal had no authority to grant them their lives without consulting\r\nhim. He then launched out into an invective against Rome: and when he\r\nhad finished that, he distributed all the prisoners who were Romans\r\namong the companies of his army to be held in safe keeping; but allowed\r\nall the allies to depart without ransom to their own country, with\r\nthe same remark as he had made before, that “he was not come to fight\r\nagainst Italians, but in behalf of Italians against Rome.” He then gave\r\nhis army time to refresh themselves after their fatigue, and buried\r\nthose of highest rank who had fallen in his army, amounting to about\r\nthirty; the total number of his loss being fifteen hundred, most of\r\nwhom were Celts. He then began considering, in conjunction with his\r\nbrother and friends, where and how he should continue his attack, for\r\nhe now felt confident of ultimate success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dismay at Rome.]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this disaster reached Rome, the chief men of the state\r\ncould not, in view of the gravity of the blow, conceal its extent or\r\nsoften it down, but were forced to assemble the people and tell them\r\nthe truth. When the Praetor, therefore, from the Rostra said, “We have\r\nbeen beaten in a great battle,” there was such a consternation, that\r\nthose who had been present at the battle as well as at this meeting,\r\nfelt the disaster to be graver than when they were on the field of\r\nbattle itself. And this feeling of the people was not to be wondered\r\nat. For many years they had been unaccustomed to the word or the fact\r\nof defeat, and they could not now endure reverse with patience or\r\ndignity. The Senate, however, rose to the occasion, and held protracted\r\ndebates and consultations as to the future, anxiously considering what\r\nit was the duty of all classes to do, and how they were to do it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Servilius’s advanced guard cut to pieces.]\r\n\r\n+86.+ About the same time as the battle of Thrasymene, the Consul\r\nGnaeus Servilius, who had been stationed on duty at Ariminum,—which is\r\non the coast of the Adriatic, where the plains of Cis-Alpine Gaul join\r\nthe rest of Italy, not far from the mouths of the Padus,—having heard\r\nthat Hannibal had entered Etruria and was encamped near Flaminius,\r\ndesigned to join the latter with his whole army. But finding himself\r\nhampered by the difficulty of transporting so heavy a force, he sent\r\nGaius Centenius forward in haste with four thousand horse, intending\r\nthat he should be there before himself in case of need. But Hannibal,\r\ngetting early intelligence after the battle of Thrasymene of this\r\nreinforcement of the enemy, sent Maharbal with his light-armed troops,\r\nand a detachment of cavalry, who falling in with Gaius, killed nearly\r\nhalf his men at the first encounter; and having pursued the remainder\r\nto a certain hill, on the very next day took them all prisoners. The\r\nnews of the battle of Thrasymene was three days’ old at Rome, and\r\nthe sorrow caused by it was, so to speak, at its hottest, when this\r\nfurther disaster was announced. The consternation caused by it was no\r\nlonger confined to the people. The Senate now fully shared in it; and\r\nit was resolved that the usual annual arrangements for the election of\r\nmagistrates should be suspended, and a more radical remedy be sought\r\nfor the present dangers; for they came to the conclusion that their\r\naffairs were in such a state, as to require a commander with absolute\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s advance after the battle.]\r\n\r\nFeeling now entirely confident of success, Hannibal rejected the\r\nidea of approaching Rome for the present; but traversed the country\r\nplundering it without resistance, and directing his march towards the\r\ncoast of the Adriatic. Having passed through Umbria and Picenum, he\r\ncame upon the coast after a ten days’ march with such enormous booty,\r\nthat the army could neither drive nor carry all the wealth which they\r\nhad taken, and after killing a large number of people on his road.\r\nFor the order was given, usual in the storming of cities, to kill all\r\nadults who came in their way: an order which Hannibal was prompted to\r\ngive now by his deep-seated hatred of Rome.[189]\r\n\r\n+87.+ Pitching his camp on the shore of the Adriatic, in a district\r\nextraordinarily rich in every kind of produce, he took great pains to\r\nrefresh his men and restore their health, and no less so that of the\r\nhorses. For the cold and squalor of a winter spent in Gallia Cis-Alpina\r\nwithout the protection of a roof, and then the painful march through\r\nthe marshes, had brought upon most of the horses, and the men as well,\r\nan attack of scurvy and all its consequences. Having therefore now got\r\npossession of a rich country, he got his horses into condition again,\r\nand restored the bodies and spirits of his soldiers; and made the\r\nLibyans change their own for Roman arms selected for the purpose, which\r\nhe could easily do from being possessed of so many sets stripped from\r\nthe bodies of the enemy. He now sent messengers, too, to Carthage by\r\nsea, to report what had taken place, for this was the first time he had\r\nreached the sea since he entered Italy. The Carthaginians were greatly\r\nrejoiced at the news: and took measures with enthusiasm for forwarding\r\nsupplies to their armies, both in Iberia and Italy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Q. Fabius Maximus Dictator.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Romans had appointed Quintus Fabius Dictator,[190] a\r\nman distinguished no less for his wisdom than his high birth; as is\r\nstill commemorated by the fact that the members of his family are even\r\nnow called _Maximi_, that is “Greatest,” in honour of his successful\r\nachievements. A Dictator differs from the Consuls in this, that each\r\nConsul is followed by twelve lictors, the Dictator by twenty-four.\r\nAgain, the Consuls have frequently to refer to the Senate to enable\r\nthem to carry out their proposed plans, but the Dictator is absolute,\r\nand when he is appointed all other magistrates in Rome are at once\r\ndeprived of power, except the Tribunes of the People.[191] I shall,\r\nhowever, take another opportunity of speaking in more detail about\r\nthese officers. With the Dictator they appointed Marcus Minucius master\r\nof the horse; this is an officer under the Dictator, and takes his\r\nplace when engaged elsewhere.\r\n\r\n+88.+ Though Hannibal shifted his quarters from time to time for short\r\ndistances in one direction or another, he remained in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Adriatic; and by bathing his horses with old wine, of which he\r\nhad a great store, cured them of the scab and got them into condition\r\nagain. By a similar treatment he cured his men of their wounds, and got\r\nthe others into a sound state of health and spirits for the service\r\nbefore them. After traversing with fire and sword the territories\r\nof Praetutia,[192] Hadriana, Marrucina, and Frentana, he started on\r\nhis road to Iapygia. This district is divided among three peoples,\r\neach with a district name, Daunii [Peucetii], and Messapii. Hannibal\r\nfirst invaded the territory of the Daunii, beginning from Luceria, a\r\nRoman colony, and laid the country waste. He next encamped near Vibo,\r\nand overran the territory of Arpi, and plundered all Daunia without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fabius takes the command.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Fabius, after offering the usual sacrifice to the gods\r\nupon his appointment, started with his master of the horse and four\r\nlegions which had been enrolled for the purpose; and having effected a\r\njunction near Daunia with the troops that had come to the rescue from\r\nAriminum, he relieved Gnaeus of his command on shore and sent him with\r\nan escort to Rome, with orders to be ready with help for any emergency,\r\nin case the Carthaginians made any movement by sea. Fabius himself,\r\nwith his master of the horse, took over the command of the whole army\r\nand pitched his camp opposite the Carthaginians, near a place called\r\nAecae,[193] about six miles from the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cunctator.]\r\n\r\n+89.+ When Hannibal learnt that Fabius had arrived, he determined to\r\nterrify the enemy by promptly attacking. He therefore led out his\r\narmy, approached the Roman camp, and there drew up his men in order of\r\nbattle; but when he had waited some time, and nobody came out to attack\r\nhim, he drew off and retired to his own camp. For Fabius, having made\r\nup his mind to incur no danger and not to risk a battle, but to make\r\nthe safety of his men his first and greatest object, kept resolutely\r\nto this purpose. At first he was despised for it, and gave rise to\r\nscandalous insinuations that he was an utter coward and dared not face\r\nan engagement: but in course of time he compelled everybody to confess\r\nand allow that it was impossible for any one to have acted, in the\r\nexisting circumstances, with greater discretion and prudence. And it\r\nwas not long before facts testified to the wisdom of his policy. Nor\r\nwas it wonderful that it was so. For the forces of his opponents had\r\nbeen trained from their earliest youth without intermission in war;\r\nhad a general who had grown up with them and from childhood had been\r\ninstructed in the arts of the camp; had won many battles in Iberia,\r\nand twice running had beaten the Romans and their allies: and, what\r\nwas more than all, had thoroughly made up their minds that their one\r\nhope of safety was in victory. In every respect the circumstances of\r\nthe Roman army were the exact opposite of these; and therefore, their\r\nmanifest inferiority making it impossible for Fabius to offer the enemy\r\nbattle, he fell back upon those resources in which the Romans had the\r\nadvantage of the enemy; clung to them; and conducted the war by their\r\nmeans: and they were—an inexhaustible supply of provisions and of men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minucius discontented.]\r\n\r\n+90.+ He, then, during the following months, kept his army continually\r\nhovering in the neighbourhood of the enemy, his superior knowledge\r\nof the country enabling him to occupy beforehand all the posts of\r\nvantage; and having supplies in abundance on his rear, he never allowed\r\nhis soldiers to go on foraging expeditions, or get separated, on any\r\npretence, from the camp; but keeping them continually massed together\r\nand in close union, he watched for favourable opportunities of time\r\nand place; and by this method of proceeding captured and killed a\r\nlarge number of the enemy, who in their contempt of him straggled from\r\ntheir camp in search of plunder. His object in these manœuvres was\r\ntwofold,—to gradually diminish the limited numbers of the enemy: and\r\nto strengthen and renew by such successes in detail the spirits of his\r\nown men, which had been depressed, to begin with, by the general defeat\r\nof their armies. But nothing would induce him to agree to give his\r\nenemy a set battle. This policy however was by no means approved of by\r\nhis master of the horse, Marcus. He joined in the general verdict, and\r\ndecried Fabius in every one’s hearing, as conducting his command in a\r\ncowardly and unenterprising spirit; and was himself eager to venture\r\nupon a decisive engagement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal in Samnium and Apulia.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Carthaginians, after wasting these districts, crossed\r\nthe Apennines; and descending upon Samnium, which was rich and had\r\nbeen free from war for many years past, found themselves in possession\r\nof such an abundance of provisions, that they could get rid of\r\nthem neither by use nor waste. They overran also the territory of\r\nBeneventum, which was a Roman colony; and took the town of Venusia,\r\nwhich was unwalled and richly furnished with every kind of property.\r\nAll this time the Romans were following on his rear, keeping one or\r\ntwo days’ march behind him, but never venturing to approach or engage\r\nthe enemy. Accordingly, when Hannibal saw that Fabius plainly meant to\r\ndecline a battle, but yet would not abandon the country altogether, he\r\nformed the bold resolution of penetrating to the plains round Capua;\r\nand actually did so as far as Falernum, convinced that thereby he\r\nshould do one of two things,—force the enemy to give him battle, or\r\nmake it evident to all that the victory was his, and that the Romans\r\nhad abandoned the country to him. This he hoped would strike terror\r\ninto the various cities, and cause them to be eager to revolt from\r\nRome. For up to that time, though the Romans had been beaten in two\r\nbattles, not a single city in Italy had revolted to the Carthaginians;\r\nbut all maintained their fidelity, although some of them were suffering\r\nseverely;—a fact which may show us the awe and respect which the\r\nRepublic had inspired in its allies.\r\n\r\n+91.+ Hannibal, however, had not adopted this plan without good reason.\r\nFor the plains about Capua are the best in Italy for fertility and\r\nbeauty and proximity to the sea, and for the commercial harbours, into\r\nwhich merchants run who are sailing to Italy from nearly all parts of\r\nthe world. They contain, moreover, the most famous and beautiful cities\r\nof Italy. On its seaboard are Sinuessa, Cumae, Puteoli, Naples, and\r\nNuceria; and inland to the north there are Cales and Teanum, to the\r\neast and south [Caudium[194]] and Nola. In the centre of these plains\r\nlies the richest of all the cities, that of Capua. No tale in all\r\nmythology wears a greater appearance of probability than that which\r\nis told of these, which, like others remarkable for their beauty, are\r\ncalled the Phlegraean plains; for surely none are more likely for\r\nbeauty and fertility to have been contended for by gods. In addition to\r\nthese advantages, they are strongly protected by nature and difficult\r\nof approach; for one side is protected by the sea, and the rest by a\r\nlong and high chain of mountains, through which there are but three\r\npasses from the interior, narrow and difficult, one from Samnium [a\r\nsecond from Latium[195]] and a third from Hirpini. So that if the\r\nCarthaginians succeeded in fixing their quarters in these plains, they\r\nwould have the advantage of a kind of theatre, in which to display\r\nthe terrors of their power before the gaze of all Italy; and would\r\nmake a spectacle also of the cowardice of their enemies in shrinking\r\nfrom giving them battle, while they themselves would be proved beyond\r\ndispute to be masters of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal descends into the Falernian plain.]\r\n\r\n+92.+ With this view Hannibal crossed from Samnium by the pass of the\r\nhill called Eribianus,[196] and encamped on the bank of the river\r\nVulturnus, which almost divides these plains in half. His camp was on\r\nthe side of the river towards Rome, but he overran the whole plain with\r\nforaging parties. Though utterly aghast at the audacity of the enemy’s\r\nproceedings, Fabius stuck all the more firmly to the policy upon which\r\nhe had determined. But his colleague Minucius, and all the centurions\r\nand tribunes of the army, thinking that they had caught the enemy in an\r\nexcellent trap, were of opinion that they should make all haste into\r\nthe plains, and not allow the most splendid part of the country to be\r\ndevastated. Until they reached the spot, Fabius hurried on, and feigned\r\nto share their eager and adventurous spirit; and, when he was near\r\nthe ager Falernus, he showed himself on the mountain skirts and kept\r\nin a line with the enemy, that he might not be thought by the allies\r\nto abandon the country: but he would not let his army descend into\r\nthe plain, being still unwilling to risk a general engagement, partly\r\nfor the same reasons as before, and partly because the enemy were\r\nconspicuously superior in cavalry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fabius lies in wait.]\r\n\r\nAfter trying to provoke his enemies, and collecting an unlimited\r\namount of booty by laying waste the whole plain, Hannibal began taking\r\nmeasures for removing: wishing not to waste his booty, but to stow it\r\nin some safe place, which he might also make his winter quarters; that\r\nthe army might not only be well off for the present, but might have\r\nabundant supplies all through the winter. Fabius, learning that he\r\nmeditated returning the same way as he came, and seeing that the pass\r\nwas a narrow one, and extremely well suited for an attack by ambush,\r\nplaced about four thousand men at the exact spot that he would have to\r\npass; while he, with the main body of his troops, encamped on a hill\r\nwhich commanded the entrance of the pass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal eludes him.]\r\n\r\n+93.+ Fabius hoped when the Carthaginians came thither, and encamped on\r\nthe plain immediately under the foot of the hill, that he would be able\r\nto snatch away their plunder without any risk to himself; and, most of\r\nall, might even put an end to the whole war by means of the excellent\r\nsituation for an attack in which he now was. He was accordingly wholly\r\nintent on forming plans for this purpose, anxiously considering in what\r\ndirection and in what manner he should avail himself of the advantages\r\nof the ground, and which of his men were to be the first to attack\r\nthe enemy. Whilst his enemies were making these preparations for the\r\nnext day, Hannibal, guessing the truth, took care to give them no time\r\nor leisure for executing their design; but summoning Hasdrubal, the\r\ncaptain of his pioneers, ordered him, with all speed, to make as many\r\nfagots of dry wood of all sorts as possible, and selecting two thousand\r\nof the strongest of the working oxen from the booty, to collect them\r\noutside the camp. When this was done, he summoned the pioneers, and\r\npointed out to them a certain ridge lying between the camp and the\r\ngorge by which he meant to march. To this ridge they were to drive the\r\noxen, when the order was given, as actively and energetically as they\r\ncould, until they came to the top. Having given these instructions, he\r\nbade them take their supper and go to rest betimes. Towards the end\r\nof the third watch of the night he led the pioneers out of the camp,\r\nand ordered them to tie the fagots to the horns of the oxen. The men\r\nbeing numerous, this did not take long to do; and he then ordered them\r\nto set the fagots all alight, and to drive the oxen off and force them\r\nto mount the ridge; and placing his light-armed troops behind them he\r\nordered them to assist the drivers up to a certain distance: but, as\r\nsoon as the beasts had got well started, to take open order and pass\r\nthem at the double, and, with as much noise as possible, make for the\r\ntop of the ridge; that, if they found any of the enemy there, they\r\nmight close with and attack them at once. At the same time he himself\r\nled the main army towards the narrow gorge of the pass,—his heavy-armed\r\nmen in front, next to them the cavalry, then the booty, and the\r\nIberians and Celts bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\n+94.+ The Romans who were guarding the gorge, no sooner saw these\r\nfiery fagots advancing to the heights, than, quitting the narrow part\r\nof the pass, they made for the ridge to meet the enemy. But when they\r\ngot near the oxen, they were puzzled by the lights, imagining them\r\nto be something more dangerous than they really were; and when the\r\nCarthaginian light-armed troops came on to the ground, after some\r\nslight skirmishing between the two parties, upon the oxen rushing in\r\namong them, they separated and took up their positions on different\r\nheights and waited for daybreak, not being able to comprehend what was\r\ntaking place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal gets through the pass. Autumn, B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\nPartly because he was at a loss to understand what was happening, and,\r\nin the words of the poet, “some deep design suspecting;”[197] and\r\npartly that, in accordance with his original plan, he was determined\r\nnot to risk a general engagement, Fabius remained quietly within his\r\ncamp: while Hannibal, finding everything going as he designed, led his\r\narmy and booty in safety through the gorge, the men who had been set to\r\nguard the narrow road having abandoned their post. At daybreak, seeing\r\nthe two troops fronting each other on the heights, he sent some Iberian\r\ncompanies to the light-armed troops, who engaged the Romans, and,\r\nkilling a thousand of them, easily relieved his own light-armed troops\r\nand brought them down to the main body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fabius goes to Rome, leaving the command to M. Minucius.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus effected his departure from the Falernian plain, Hannibal\r\nthenceforth busied himself in looking out for a place in which to\r\nwinter, and in making the necessary preparations, after having inspired\r\nthe utmost alarm and uncertainty in the cities and inhabitants of Italy.\r\n\r\nThough Fabius meanwhile was in great disrepute among the common people,\r\nfor having let his enemy escape from such a trap, he nevertheless\r\nrefused to abandon his policy; and being shortly afterwards obliged to\r\ngo to Rome to perform certain sacrifices, he handed over the command of\r\nhis legions to his master of the horse, with many parting injunctions,\r\nnot to be so anxious to inflict a blow upon the enemy, as to avoid\r\nreceiving one himself. Marcus, however, paid no heed to the advice,\r\nand, even while Fabius was speaking, had wholly resolved to risk a\r\ngeneral engagement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spain, B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+95.+ While these things were going on in Italy, Hasdrubal, who was in\r\ncommand in Iberia, having during the winter repaired the thirty ships\r\nleft him by his brother, and manned ten additional ones, got a fleet of\r\nforty decked vessels to sea, at the beginning of the summer, from New\r\nCarthage, under the command of Hamilcar; and at the same time collected\r\nhis land forces, and led them out of their winter quarters. The fleet\r\ncoasted up the country, and the troops marched along the shore towards\r\nthe Iber. Suspecting their design, Gnaeus Scipio was for issuing from\r\nhis winter quarters and meeting them both by land and sea. But hearing\r\nof the number of their troops, and the great scale on which their\r\npreparations had been made, he gave up the idea of meeting them by\r\nland; and manning thirty-five ships, and taking on board the best men\r\nhe could get from his land forces to serve as marines, he put to sea,\r\nand arrived on the second day near the mouth of the Iber. Here he came\r\nto anchor, at a distance of about ten miles from the enemy, and sent\r\ntwo swift-sailing Massilian vessels to reconnoitre. For the sailors of\r\nMarseilles were the first in every service of difficulty and danger,\r\nand ready at the shortest notice to do whatever was required of them;\r\nand, in fact, Marseilles has distinguished itself above all other\r\nplaces, before and since, in fidelity to Rome, and never more so than\r\nin the Hannibalian war. The ships sent to reconnoitre having reported\r\nthat the enemy’s fleet was lying off the mouth of the Iber, Scipio put\r\nto sea with all speed, wishing to surprise them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman success at sea.]\r\n\r\n+96.+ But being informed in good time by his look-out men that the\r\nenemy were bearing down upon him, Hasdrubal drew up his troops on the\r\nbeach, and ordered his crews to go on board; and, when the Romans hove\r\nin sight, gave the signal for the attack, determined to fight the\r\nenemy at sea. But, after engaging, the Carthaginians made but a short\r\nstruggle for victory, and very soon gave way. For the support of the\r\ntroops on the beach did less service in encouraging them to attack,\r\nthan harm in offering them a safe place of retreat. Accordingly,\r\nafter losing two ships with their crews, and the oars and marines of\r\nfour others, they gave way and made for the land; and when the Romans\r\npressed on with spirit in pursuit, they ran their ships ashore, and\r\nleaping from the vessels fled for refuge to the troops. The Romans\r\ncame boldly close to land, towed off such of the vessels as could be\r\ngot afloat, and sailed away in great exultation at having beaten the\r\nenemy at the first blow, secured the mastery of the sea, and taken\r\ntwenty-five of the enemy’s ships.\r\n\r\nIn Iberia therefore, after this victory, the Roman prospects had begun\r\nto brighten. But when news of this reverse arrived at Carthage, the\r\nCarthaginians at once despatched a fleet of seventy ships, judging it\r\nto be essential to their whole design that they should command the\r\nsea. These ships touched first at Sardinia and then at Pisae in Italy,\r\nthe commanders believing that they should find Hannibal there. But\r\nthe Romans at once put to sea to attack them from Rome itself, with\r\na fleet of a hundred and twenty quinqueremes; and hearing of this\r\nexpedition against them, the Carthaginians sailed back to Sardinia, and\r\nthence returned to Carthage. Gnaeus Servilius, who was in command of\r\nthis Roman fleet, followed the Carthaginians for a certain distance,\r\nbelieving that he should fall in with them; but, finding that he was\r\nfar behind, he gave up the attempt. He first put in at Lilybaeum, and\r\nafterwards sailed to the Libyan island of Cercina; and after receiving\r\na sum of money from the inhabitants on condition of not laying waste\r\nthe country, he departed. On his return voyage he took the island of\r\nCossyrus, and having put a garrison into its small capital, returned to\r\nLilybaeum. There he placed the fleet, and shortly afterwards went off\r\nhimself to join the land army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Publius Scipio, whose imperium is prolonged after his\r\nConsulship of the previous year, with Spain assigned as his province,\r\nis sent to join his brother there with 20 ships: early in B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+97.+ When the Senate heard of Gnaeus Scipio’s naval success, believing\r\nit to be advantageous or rather essential not to relax their hold on\r\nIberia, but to press on the war there against Carthage with redoubled\r\nvigour, they prepared a fleet of twenty ships, and put them under the\r\ncommand of Publius Scipio; and in accordance with arrangements already\r\nmade, despatched him with all speed to join his brother Gnaeus, and\r\ncarry on the Iberian campaign in conjunction with him. Their great\r\nanxiety was lest the Carthaginians should get the upper hand in Iberia,\r\nand thus possessing themselves of abundant supplies and recruits,\r\nshould get a more complete mastery of the sea, and assist the invasion\r\nof Italy, by sending troops and money to Hannibal. Regarding therefore\r\nthe Iberian war as of the utmost importance, they sent these ships\r\nand Publius Scipio to that country; who, when he arrived in Iberia,\r\neffected a junction with his brother and did most substantial service\r\nto the State. For up to that time the Romans had not ventured to cross\r\nthe Iber; but had thought themselves fortunate if they could secure the\r\nfriendship and allies of the tribes up to that river. They now however\r\ndid cross it, and for the first time had the courage to attempt a\r\nmovement on the other side: their designs being greatly favoured also\r\nby an accidental circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhen the two brothers, after overawing the Iberian tribes that lived\r\nnear the passage of the Iber, had arrived before the city of Saguntum,\r\nthey pitched their camp about forty stades from it, near the temple of\r\nAphrodite, selecting the position as offering at once security from the\r\nattacks of the enemy, and a means of getting supplies by sea: for their\r\nfleet was coasting down parallel with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treason of Abilyx.]\r\n\r\n+98.+ Here an event occurred which produced a decisive change in their\r\nfavour. When Hannibal was about to start for Italy, from the Iberian\r\ntowns whose loyalty he suspected he took the sons of their leading men\r\nas hostages, and placed them all in Saguntum, because of the strength\r\nof that town and his confidence in the fidelity of those who were left\r\nin charge of it. Now there was a certain Iberian there named Abilyx,\r\nwho enjoyed the highest character and reputation with his countrymen,\r\nand was believed to be especially well disposed and loyal to the\r\nCarthaginians. Seeing how affairs were going, and believing that the\r\nfortune of the Romans was in the ascendant, he formed in his own mind a\r\nscheme, worthy of an Iberian and barbarian, for giving up the hostages.\r\nConvinced that he might obtain a high place in the favour of Rome, if\r\nhe gave a proof of his fidelity at a critical moment, he made up his\r\nmind to turn traitor to Carthage and put the hostages in the hands\r\nof the Romans. He began his machinations by addressing himself to\r\nBostar, the Carthaginian general who had been despatched by Hasdrubal\r\nto prevent the Romans from crossing the river, but, not venturing to\r\ndo this, had retreated, and was now encamped in the region of Saguntum\r\nnext the sea. To this man, who was of a guileless and gentle character,\r\nand quite disposed to trust him, Abilyx now introduced the subject of\r\nthe hostages. He argued that “the Romans having now crossed the Iber,\r\nthe Carthaginians could no longer hold Iberia by terror, but stood\r\nnow in need of the good feeling of their subjects: seeing then that\r\nthe Romans had actually approached Saguntum and were besieging it,\r\nand that the city was in danger,—if he were to take the hostages and\r\nrestore them to their parents and cities, he would not only frustrate\r\nthe ambitious scheme of the Romans, who wished above all things by\r\ngetting possession of the hostages to have the credit of doing this;\r\nbut would also rouse a feeling of goodwill towards Carthage in all\r\nthe cities, for having taken thought for the future and provided for\r\nthe safety of the hostages. He would, too, much enhance the favour by\r\npersonally managing this business: for if he restored these boys to\r\ntheir homes, he would provoke the gratitude, not only of their parents,\r\nbut of the people at large also, by giving a striking instance of\r\nthe magnanimous policy of Carthage towards her allies. He might even\r\nexpect large rewards for himself from the families that recovered their\r\nchildren; for all those, who thus unexpectedly got into their hands\r\nthe dearest objects of their affection, would vie with each other in\r\nheaping favours on the author of such a service.” By these and similar\r\narguments he persuaded Bostar to fall in with his proposals.\r\n\r\n+99.+ Abilyx then went away, after arranging a fixed day on which he\r\nwould appear with everything necessary for conveying the boys. At\r\nnight he made his way to the Roman lines, and, having fallen in with\r\nsome Iberians serving in the Roman army, was by them conducted to\r\nthe generals; to whom he discoursed at great length on the revulsion\r\nof feeling of the Iberians in their favour, which would be caused\r\nif they got possession of the hostages: and finally offered to put\r\nthe boys in their hands. Publius Scipio received the proposal with\r\nextreme eagerness: and, promising him large rewards, he agreed with\r\nhim on a day, hour, and place at which a party were to be waiting to\r\nreceive him. After returning home, Abilyx next went with a band of\r\nchosen friends to Bostar; and, after receiving the boys, left the camp\r\nat night, as though he wished not to be seen by the Roman camp as he\r\npassed it, and came at the appointed time to the place arranged, and\r\nthere handed over all the boys to the Roman officers. Publius treated\r\nAbilyx with special honour, and employed him in restoring the boys\r\nto their native cities, along with certain of his own friends. He\r\naccordingly went from city to city, giving them a visible proof by\r\nthe restoration of the boys of the Roman mildness and magnanimity, in\r\ncontrast to the Carthaginian suspiciousness and harshness; and bidding\r\nthem also observe that he had found it necessary to change sides, he\r\ninduced many Iberians to join the Roman alliance. Bostar was thought,\r\nin thus surrendering the hostages to the enemy, to have behaved more\r\nlike a child than became a man of his age, and was in serious danger\r\nof his life. For the present, however, as it was getting late in the\r\nseason, both sides began dispersing into winter quarters; the Romans\r\nhaving made an important step towards success in the matter of the boys.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal takes Geronium.]\r\n\r\n+100.+ Such was the position of affairs in Iberia. To return to\r\nHannibal, whom we left having just effected the passage from the\r\nFalernian plain. Hearing from his scouts that there was abundance of\r\ncorn in the district round Luceria and Geronium, and that Geronium\r\nwas an excellent place to store it in, he determined to make his\r\nwinter quarters there; and accordingly marched thither by way of Mount\r\nLiburnum. And having come to Geronium, which is about two hundred\r\nstades from Luceria, he first endeavoured to win over the inhabitants\r\nby promises, offering them pledges of his good faith; but when no one\r\nwould listen to him, he determined to lay siege to the town. Having\r\ntaken it without much delay, he put the inhabitants to the sword;\r\nbut preserved most of the houses and walls, because he wished to use\r\nthem as granaries for his winter camp: and having encamped his army\r\nin front of it, he fortified his position with trench and palisade.\r\nHaving finished these labours, he sent out two-thirds of the army to\r\ncollect corn, with orders to bring home every day, each division for\r\nthe use of its own men, as much as the regular heads of this department\r\nwould usually supply: while with the remaining third of his army he\r\nkept watch over his camp, and occupied certain places with a view\r\nof protecting the foraging parties in case they were attacked. The\r\ndistrict being mostly very accessible and flat, and the harvesting\r\nparty being almost innumerable, and the season moreover being at the\r\nvery best stage for such operations, the amount of corn collected every\r\nday was very great.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minucius obtains a slight success. Autumn B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+101.+ When Minucius took over the command from Fabius, he at first\r\nkept along the line of hills, feeling certain that he would sooner\r\nor later fall in with the Carthaginians; but when he heard that\r\nHannibal had already taken Geronium, and was collecting the corn of\r\nthe country, and had pitched his camp in front of the town, he changed\r\nthe direction of his march, and descended from the top of the hills by\r\nway of a ridge leading down into the plains. Arriving at the height\r\nwhich lies in the territory of Larinum, and is called Calena, he\r\nencamped round its foot, being eager on any terms whatever to engage\r\nthe enemy. When Hannibal saw the enemy approaching, he sent a third of\r\nhis army foraging for corn, but took the other two-thirds with him,\r\nand, advancing sixteen stades from Geronium towards the enemy, pitched\r\na camp upon a piece of rising ground, with a view at once of overawing\r\nhis opponents, and affording safety to his foraging parties: and there\r\nbeing another elevation between him and the two armies, which was near,\r\nand conveniently placed for an attack upon the enemy’s lines, he sent\r\nout about two thousand light-armed troops in the night and seized it.\r\nAt daybreak when Minucius saw these men, he took his own light-armed\r\ntroops and assaulted the hill. After a gallant skirmish the Romans\r\nprevailed; and subsequently their whole camp was transferred to this\r\nplace. For a certain time Hannibal kept his men for the most part\r\nwithin their lines, because the camps were so close to each other; but,\r\nafter the lapse of some days, he was obliged to divide them into two\r\nparties, one for pasturing the animals, and one for gathering corn:\r\nbeing very anxious to carry out his design of avoiding the destruction\r\nof his booty, and of collecting as much corn as possible, that his men\r\nmight have abundant food during the winter, and his horses and beasts\r\nof burden as much so; for the chief hope of his army rested on his\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carthaginian foragers cut off.]\r\n\r\n+102.+ It was then that Minucius, seeing the great part of the enemy\r\nscattered about the country on these services, selected the exact hour\r\nof the day when they would be away to lead out his army. Having come\r\nclose to the Carthaginian lines he drew out his heavy-armed troops\r\nthere; and then, dividing his cavalry and light-armed into detachments,\r\nsent them in search of the foragers, ordering them to give no quarter.\r\nThis put Hannibal into a great difficulty: for he was not strong\r\nenough to accept battle with the enemy drawn up outside his lines, or\r\nto relieve those of his men who were scattered about the country. The\r\nRomans meanwhile who had been sent to take the foragers found a great\r\nnumber of them scattered about, and killed them; while the troops\r\ndrawn up in front of the camp grew so contemptuous of the enemy, that\r\nthey even began to pull down their palisade, and all but assaulted\r\nthe Carthaginians. Hannibal was in a very dangerous position: but in\r\nspite of the storm that had suddenly fallen on him, he held his ground,\r\nrepulsing the enemy when they approached and defending, though with\r\ndifficulty, the rampart; until Hasdrubal came to his relief with about\r\nfour thousand of the foraging parties, who had fled for refuge from the\r\ncountry and collected within the lines near Geronium. This encouraged\r\nHannibal to make a sally: and having got into order of battle a short\r\ndistance from the camp, he just managed with difficulty to avert the\r\nthreatened danger. After killing large numbers of the enemy in the\r\nstruggle at the camp, and still more in the open country, Minucius for\r\nthe present retired, but with great hopes for the future; and on the\r\nmorrow, the Carthaginians having abandoned their lines on the hill, he\r\nwent up and occupied their position. For Hannibal being alarmed lest\r\nthe Romans should go by night and find the camp at Geronium undefended,\r\nand become masters of his baggage and stores, determined to retire\r\nthither himself and again fix his quarters there. After this the\r\nCarthaginians were more timid and cautious in their manner of foraging;\r\nwhile the Romans on the other hand acted with greater boldness and\r\nrecklessness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minucius invested with co-equal powers with Fabius.]\r\n\r\n+103.+ An exaggerated account of this success reached Rome, and caused\r\nexcessive exultation: first, because in their gloomy prospects some\r\nsort of change for the better had at last shown itself; and, secondly,\r\nbecause the people could now believe that the ill success and want of\r\nnerve, which had hitherto attended the legions, had not arisen from\r\nthe cowardice of the men, but the timidity of their leader. Wherefore\r\neverybody began finding fault with and depreciating Fabius, as failing\r\nto seize his opportunities with spirit; while they extolled Minucius\r\nto such a degree for what had happened, that a thing was done for\r\nwhich there was no precedent. They gave him absolute power as well as\r\nFabius, believing that he would quickly put an end to the campaign; and\r\nso there were two Dictators made for carrying on the same war, which\r\nhad never happened at Rome before. When Minucius was informed of his\r\npopularity with the people, and of the office bestowed upon him by the\r\ncitizens, he felt doubly incited to run all risks and act with daring\r\nboldness against the enemy. Fabius rejoined the army with sentiments\r\nnot in the least changed by what had happened, but rather fixed\r\nstill more immovably on his original policy. Seeing, however, that\r\nMinucius was puffed up with pride, and inclined to offer him a jealous\r\nopposition at every turn, and was wholly bent on risking an engagement,\r\nhe offered him the choice of two alternatives: either to command the\r\nwhole army on alternate days with him; or that they should separate\r\ntheir two armies, and each command their respective part in their own\r\nway. Minucius joyfully accepting the second alternative, they divided\r\nthe men and encamped separately about twelve stades apart.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal draws on Minucius.]\r\n\r\n+104.+ Partly from observing what was taking place, and partly from the\r\ninformation of prisoners, Hannibal knew of the mutual jealousy of the\r\ntwo generals, and the impetuosity and ambition of Minucius. Looking\r\nupon what was happening in the enemy’s camp as rather in his favour\r\nthan otherwise, he set himself to deal with Minucius; being anxious\r\nto put an end to his bold methods and check in time his adventurous\r\nspirit. There being then an elevation between his camp and that of\r\nMinucius, which might prove dangerous to either, he resolved to occupy\r\nit; and, knowing full well that, elated by his previous success,\r\nMinucius would be certain to move out at once to oppose his design, he\r\nconcerted the following plan. The country round the hill being bare of\r\ntrees, but having much broken ground and hollows of every description,\r\nhe despatched some men during the night, in bodies of two and three\r\nhundred, to occupy the most favourable positions, numbering in all five\r\nhundred horse and five thousand light-armed and other infantry: and in\r\norder that they might not be observed in the morning by the enemy’s\r\nforaging parties, he seized the hill at daybreak with his light-armed\r\ntroops. When Marcus saw what was taking place, he looked upon it as\r\nan excellent opportunity; and immediately despatched his light-armed\r\ntroops, with orders to engage the enemy and contest the possession of\r\nthe position; after these he sent his cavalry, and close behind them\r\nhe led his heavy-armed troops in person, as on the former occasion,\r\nintending to repeat exactly the same manœuvres.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fabius comes to the rescue.]\r\n\r\n+105.+ As the day broke, and the thoughts and eyes of all were\r\nengrossed in observing the combatants on the hill, the Romans had no\r\nsuspicion of the troops lying in ambush. But as Hannibal kept pouring\r\nin reinforcements for his men on the hill, and followed close behind\r\nthem himself with his cavalry and main body, it was not long before\r\nthe cavalry also of both sides were engaged. The result was that the\r\nRoman light-armed troops, finding themselves hard pressed by the\r\nnumbers of the cavalry, caused great confusion among the heavy-armed\r\ntroops by retreating into their lines; and the signal being given at\r\nthe same time to those who were in ambush, these latter suddenly showed\r\nthemselves and charged: whereby not only the Roman light-armed troops,\r\nbut their whole army, were in the greatest danger. At that moment\r\nFabius, seeing what was taking place, and being alarmed lest they\r\nshould sustain a complete defeat, led out his forces with all speed\r\nand came to the relief of his imperilled comrades. At his approach\r\nthe Romans quickly recovered their courage; and though their lines\r\nwere entirely broken up, they rallied again round their standards,\r\nand retired under cover of the army of Fabius, with a severe loss in\r\nthe light-armed division, and a still heavier one in the ranks of the\r\nlegions, and that too of the bravest men. Alarmed at the freshness and\r\nperfect order of the relieving army, Hannibal retired from the pursuit\r\nand ceased fighting. To those who were actually engaged it was quite\r\nclear that an utter defeat had been brought about by the rashness of\r\nMinucius, and that their safety on this and previous occasions had been\r\nsecured by the caution of Fabius; while those at home had a clear and\r\nindisputable demonstration of the difference between the rashness and\r\nbravado of a soldier, and the far-seeing prudence and cool calculation\r\nof a general. Taught by experience the Romans joined camps once more,\r\nand for the future listened to Fabius and obeyed his orders: while the\r\nCarthaginians dug a trench across the space between the knoll and their\r\nown lines, and threw up a palisade round the crest of the captured\r\nhill; and, having placed a guard upon it, proceeded thenceforth with\r\ntheir preparations for the winter unmolested.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216. Coss. G. Terentius Varro and L. Aemilius Paulus.]\r\n\r\n+106.+ The Consular elections being now come, the Romans elected Lucius\r\nAemilius and Gaius Terentius. On their appointment the Dictators laid\r\ndown their offices, and the Consuls of the previous year, Gnaeus\r\nServilius and Marcus Regulus—who had been appointed after the death\r\nof Flaminius,—were invested with proconsular authority by Aemilius;\r\nand, taking the command at the seat of war, administered the affairs\r\nof the army independently. Meanwhile Aemilius, in consultation with\r\nthe Senate, set at once to work to levy new soldiers, to fill up the\r\nnumbers of the legions required for the campaign, and despatched them\r\nto headquarters; enjoining at the same time upon Servilius that he\r\nshould by no means hazard a general engagement, but contrive detailed\r\nskirmishes, as sharp and as frequent as he could, for the sake of\r\npractising the raw recruits, and giving them courage for a pitched\r\nbattle: for they held the opinion that their former defeats were owing,\r\nas much as anything else, to the fact that they were employing troops\r\nnewly levied and entirely untrained. The Senate also sent the Praetor\r\nLucius Postumius into Gaul, to affect a diversion there, and induce the\r\nCelts who were with Hannibal to return home. They also took measures\r\nfor recalling the fleet that had wintered at Lilybaeum, and for sending\r\nto the commanders in Iberia such supplies as were necessary for the\r\nservice. Thus the Consul and Senate were busied with these and other\r\npreparations for the campaign; and Servilius, having received his\r\ninstructions from the Consuls, carried them out in every particular.\r\nThe details of this part of the campaign, therefore, I shall omit to\r\nrecord; for nothing of importance or worth remembering occurred, partly\r\nin consequence of these instructions, and partly from circumstances;\r\nbut there were a considerable number of skirmishes and petty\r\nengagements, in which the Roman commanders gained a high reputation for\r\ncourage and prudence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Autumn, B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate order a battle.]\r\n\r\n+107.+ Thus through all that winter and spring the two armies remained\r\nencamped facing each other. But when the season for the new harvest was\r\ncome, Hannibal began to move from the camp at Geronium; and making up\r\nhis mind that it would be to his advantage to force the enemy by any\r\npossible means to give him battle, he occupied the citadel of a town\r\ncalled Cannae, into which the corn and other supplies from the district\r\nround Canusium were collected by the Romans, and conveyed thence to the\r\ncamp as occasion required. The town itself, indeed, had been reduced to\r\nruins the year before: but the capture of its citadel and the material\r\nof war contained in it, caused great commotion in the Roman army;\r\nfor it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it that\r\ndistressed them, but the fact also that it commanded the surrounding\r\ndistrict. They therefore sent frequent messages to Rome asking for\r\ninstructions: for if they approached the enemy they would not be able\r\nto avoid an engagement, in view of the fact that the country was being\r\nplundered, and the allies all in a state of excitement. The Senate\r\npassed a resolution that they should give the enemy battle: they,\r\nhowever, bade Gnaeus Servilius wait, and despatched the Consuls to the\r\nseat of war. It was to Aemilius that all eyes turned, and on him the\r\nmost confident hopes were fixed; for his life had been a noble one, and\r\nhe was thought to have managed the recent Illyrian war with advantage\r\nto the State. The Senate determined to bring eight legions into the\r\nfield, which had never been done at Rome before, each legion consisting\r\nof five thousand men besides allies. For the Romans, as I have stated\r\nbefore,[198] habitually enrol four legions each year, each consisting\r\nof about four thousand foot and two hundred horse; and when any unusual\r\nnecessity arises, they raise the number of foot to five thousand and of\r\nthe horse to three hundred. Of allies, the number in each legion is the\r\nsame as that of the citizens, but of the horse three times as great. Of\r\nthe four legions thus composed, they assign two to each of the Consuls\r\nfor whatever service is going on. Most of their wars are decided by one\r\nConsul and two legions, with their quota of allies; and they rarely\r\nemploy all four at one time and on one service. But on this occasion,\r\nso great was the alarm and terror of what would happen, they resolved\r\nto bring not only four but eight legions into the field.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consuls Aemilius Paulus, and Terentius Varro go to the\r\nseat of war.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Aemilius.]\r\n\r\n+108.+ With earnest words of exhortation, therefore, to Aemilius,\r\nputting before him the gravity in every point of view of the result of\r\nthe battle, they despatched him with instructions to seek a favourable\r\nopportunity to fight a decisive battle with a courage worthy of Rome.\r\nHaving arrived at the camp and united their forces, they made known\r\nthe will of the Senate to the soldiers, and Aemilius exhorted them\r\nto do their duty in terms which evidently came from his heart. He\r\naddressed himself especially to explain and excuse the reverses which\r\nthey had lately experienced; for it was on this point particularly\r\nthat the soldiers were depressed and stood in need of encouragement.\r\n“The causes,” he argued, “of their defeats in former battles were\r\nmany, and could not be reduced to one or two. But those causes were at\r\nan end; and no excuse existed now, if they only showed themselves to\r\nbe men of courage, for not conquering their enemies. Up to that time\r\nboth Consuls had never been engaged together, or employed thoroughly\r\ntrained soldiers: the combatants on the contrary had been raw levies,\r\nentirely unexperienced in danger; and what was most important of all,\r\nthey had been so entirely ignorant of their opponents, that they had\r\nbeen brought into the field, and engaged in a pitched battle with an\r\nenemy that they had never once set eyes on. Those who had been defeated\r\non the Trebia were drawn up on the field at daybreak, on the very next\r\nmorning after their arrival from Sicily; while those who had fought in\r\nEtruria, not only had never seen the enemy before, but did not do so\r\neven during the very battle itself, owing to the unfortunate state of\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\n+109.+ But now the conditions were quite different. For in the first\r\nplace both Consuls were with the army: and were not only prepared to\r\nshare the danger themselves, but had also induced the Consuls of the\r\nprevious year to remain and take part in the struggle. While the men\r\nhad not only seen the arms, order, and numbers of the enemy, but had\r\nbeen engaged in almost daily fights with them for the last two years.\r\nThe conditions therefore under which the two former battles were fought\r\nbeing quite different, it was but natural that the result of the coming\r\nstruggle should be different too. For it would be strange or rather\r\nimpossible that those who in various skirmishes, where the numbers of\r\neither side were equal, had for the most part come off victorious,\r\nshould, when drawn up all together, and nearly double of the enemy in\r\nnumber, be defeated.”\r\n\r\n“Wherefore, men of the army,” he continued, “seeing that we have every\r\nadvantage on our side for securing a victory, there is only one thing\r\nnecessary—your determination, your zeal! And I do not think I need say\r\nmore to you on that point. To men serving others for pay, or to those\r\nwho fight as allies on behalf of others, who have no greater danger to\r\nexpect than meets them on the field, and for whom the issues at stake\r\nare of little importance,—such men may need words of exhortation. But\r\nmen who, like you, are fighting not for others, but themselves,—for\r\ncountry, wives, and children; and for whom the issue is of far more\r\nmomentous consequence than the mere danger of the hour, need only to\r\nbe reminded: require no exhortation. For who is there among you who\r\nwould not wish if possible to be victorious; and next, if that may not\r\nbe, to die with arms in his hands, rather than to live and see the\r\noutrage and death of those dear objects which I have named? Wherefore,\r\nmen of the army, apart from any words of mine, place before your eyes\r\nthe momentous difference to you between victory and defeat, and all\r\ntheir consequences. Enter upon this battle with the full conviction,\r\nthat in it your country is not risking a certain number of legions,\r\nbut her bare existence. For she has nothing to add to such an army as\r\nthis, to give her victory, if the day now goes against us. All she\r\nhas of confidence and strength rests on you; all her hopes of safety\r\nare in your hands. Do not frustrate those hopes: but pay back to your\r\ncountry the gratitude you owe her; and make it clear to all the world\r\nthat the former reverses occurred, not because the Romans are worse men\r\nthan the Carthaginians, but from the lack of experience on the part\r\nof those who were then fighting, and through a combination of adverse\r\ncircumstances.” With such words Aemilius dismissed the troops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman army approaches Cannae.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terentius Varro orders an advance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans are successful.]\r\n\r\n+110.+ Next morning the two Consuls broke up their camp, and advanced\r\nto where they heard that the enemy were entrenched. On the second day\r\nthey arrived within sight of them, and pitched their camp at about\r\nfifty stades’ distance. But when Aemilius observed that the ground\r\nwas flat and bare for some distance round, he said that they must not\r\nengage there with an enemy superior to them in cavalry; but that they\r\nmust rather try to draw him off, and lead him to ground on which the\r\nbattle would be more in the hands of the infantry. But Gaius Terentius\r\nbeing, from inexperience, of a contrary opinion, there was a dispute\r\nand misunderstanding between the leaders, which of all things is the\r\nmost dangerous. It is the custom, when the two Consuls are present,\r\nthat they should take the chief command on alternate days; and the next\r\nday happening to be the turn of Terentius, he ordered an advance with\r\na view of approaching the enemy, in spite of the protests and active\r\nopposition of his colleague. Hannibal set his light-armed troops and\r\ncavalry in motion to meet him, and charging the Romans while they were\r\nstill marching, took them by surprise and caused a great confusion in\r\ntheir ranks. The Romans repulsed the first charge by putting some of\r\ntheir heavy-armed in front; and then sending forward their light-armed\r\nand cavalry, began to get the best of the fight all along the line:\r\nthe Carthaginians having no reserves of any importance, while certain\r\ncompanies of the legionaries were mixed with the Roman light-armed,\r\nand helped to sustain the battle. Nightfall for the present put an\r\nend to a struggle which had not at all answered to the hopes of the\r\nCarthaginians. But next day Aemilius, not thinking it right to engage,\r\nand yet being unable any longer to lead off his army, encamped with\r\ntwo-thirds of it on the banks of the Aufidus, the only river which\r\nflows right through the Apennines,—that chain of mountains which forms\r\nthe watershed of all the Italian rivers, which flow either west to the\r\nTuscan sea, or east to the Hadriatic. This chain is, I say, pierced by\r\nthe Aufidus, which rises on the side of Italy nearest the Tuscan Sea,\r\nand is discharged into the Hadriatic. For the other third of his army\r\nhe caused a camp to be made across the river, to the east of the ford,\r\nabout ten stades from his own lines, and a little more from those of\r\nthe enemy; that these men, being on the other side of the river, might\r\nprotect his own foraging parties, and threaten those of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal harangues his troops.]\r\n\r\n+111.+ Then Hannibal, seeing that his circumstances called for a battle\r\nwith the enemy, being anxious lest his troops should be depressed by\r\ntheir previous reverse, and believing that it was an occasion which\r\nrequired some encouraging words, summoned a general meeting of his\r\nsoldiers. When they were assembled, he bid them all look round upon\r\nthe country, and asked them, “What better fortune they could have\r\nasked from the gods, if they had had the choice, than to fight in such\r\nground as they saw there, with the vast superiority of cavalry on their\r\nside?” And when all signified their acquiescence in such an evident\r\ntruth, he added: “First, then, give thanks to the gods: for they have\r\nbrought the enemy into this country, because they designed the victory\r\nfor us. And, next to me, for having compelled the enemy to fight,—for\r\nthey cannot avoid it any longer,—and to fight in a place so full of\r\nadvantages for us. But I do not think it becoming in me now to use many\r\nwords in exhorting you to be brave and forward in this battle. When\r\nyou had had no experience of fighting the Romans this was necessary,\r\nand I did then suggest many arguments and examples to you. But now\r\nseeing that you have undeniably beaten the Romans in three successive\r\nbattles of such magnitude, what arguments could have greater influence\r\nwith you in confirming your courage than the actual facts? Now, by\r\nyour previous battles you have got possession of the country and all\r\nits wealth; in accordance with my promises: for I have been absolutely\r\ntrue in everything I have ever said to you. But the present contest is\r\nfor the cities and the wealth in them: and if you win it, all Italy\r\nwill at once be in your power; and freed from your present hard toils,\r\nand masters of the wealth of Rome, you will by this battle become the\r\nleaders and lords of the world. This, then, is a time for deeds, not\r\nwords: for by God’s blessing I am persuaded that I shall carry out my\r\npromises to you forthwith.” His words were received with approving\r\nshouts, which he acknowledged with gratitude for their zeal; and having\r\ndismissed the assembly, he at once formed a camp on the same bank of\r\nthe river as that on which was the larger camp of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal irritates the enemy.]\r\n\r\n+112.+ Next day he gave orders that all should employ themselves in\r\nmaking preparations and getting themselves into a fit state of body.\r\nOn the day after that he drew out his men along the bank of the river,\r\nand showed that he was eager to give the enemy battle. But Aemilius,\r\ndissatisfied with his position, and seeing that the Carthaginians would\r\nsoon be obliged to shift their quarters for the sake of supplies, kept\r\nquiet in his camps, strengthening both with extra guards. After waiting\r\na considerable time, when no one came out to attack him, Hannibal\r\nput the rest of the army into camp again, but sent out his Numidian\r\nhorse to attack the enemy’s water parties from the lesser camp. These\r\nhorsemen riding right up to the lines and preventing the watering,\r\nGaius Terentius became more than ever inflamed with the desire of\r\nfighting, and the soldiers were eager for a battle, and chafed at the\r\ndelay. For there is nothing more intolerable to mankind than suspense;\r\nwhen a thing is once decided, men can but endure whatever out of the\r\ncatalogue of evils it is their misfortune to undergo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anxiety at Rome.]\r\n\r\nBut when the news arrived at Rome that the two armies were face to\r\nface, and that skirmishes between advanced parties of both sides were\r\ndaily taking place, the city was in a state of high excitement and\r\nuneasiness; the people dreading the result owing to the disasters\r\nwhich had now befallen them on more than one occasion; and foreseeing\r\nand anticipating in their imaginations what would happen if they were\r\nutterly defeated. All the oracles preserved at Rome were in everybody’s\r\nmouth; and every temple and house was full of prodigies and miracles:\r\nin consequence of which the city was one scene of vows, sacrifices,\r\nsupplicatory processions, and prayers. For the Romans in times of\r\ndanger take extraordinary pains to appease gods and men, and look upon\r\nno ceremony of that kind in such times as unbecoming or beneath their\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dispositions for the battle of Cannae.]\r\n\r\n+113.+ When he took over the command on the following day, as soon as\r\nthe sun was above the horizon, Gaius Terentius got the army in motion\r\nfrom both the camps. Those from the larger camp he drew up in order\r\nof battle, as soon as he had got them across the river, and bringing\r\nup those of the smaller camp he placed them all in the same line,\r\nselecting the south as the aspect of the whole. The Roman horse he\r\nstationed on the right wing along the river, and their foot next them\r\nin the same line, placing the maniples, however, closer together than\r\nusual, and making the depth of each maniple several times greater than\r\nits front. The cavalry of the allies he stationed on the left wing,\r\nand the light-armed troops he placed slightly in advance of the whole\r\narmy, which amounted with its allies to eighty thousand infantry and a\r\nlittle more than six thousand horse. At the same time Hannibal brought\r\nhis Balearic slingers and spearmen across the river, and stationed\r\nthem in advance of his main body; which he led out of their camp, and,\r\ngetting them across the river at two spots, drew them up opposite the\r\nenemy. On his left wing, close to the river, he stationed the Iberian\r\nand Celtic horse opposite the Roman cavalry; and next to them half\r\nthe Libyan heavy-armed foot; and next to them the Iberian and Celtic\r\nfoot; next, the other half of the Libyans, and, on the right wing, the\r\nNumidian horse. Having now got them all into line he advanced with\r\nthe central companies of the Iberians and Celts; and so arranged the\r\nother companies next these in regular gradations, that the whole line\r\nbecame crescent-shaped, diminishing in depth towards its extremities:\r\nhis object being to have his Libyans as a reserve in the battle, and to\r\ncommence the action with his Iberians and Celts.\r\n\r\n+114.+ The armour of the Libyans was Roman, for Hannibal had armed\r\nthem with a selection of the spoils taken in previous battles. The\r\nshield of the Iberians and Celts was about the same size, but their\r\nswords were quite different. For that of the Roman can thrust with as\r\ndeadly effects as it can cut, while the Gallic sword can only cut, and\r\nthat requires some room. And the companies coming alternately,—the\r\nnaked Celts, and the Iberians with their short linen tunics bordered\r\nwith purple stripes, the whole appearance of the line was strange and\r\nterrifying. The whole strength of the Carthaginian cavalry was ten\r\nthousand, but that of their foot was not more than forty thousand,\r\nincluding the Celts. Aemilius commanded on the Roman right, Gaius\r\nTerentius on the left, Marcus Atilius and Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls\r\nof the previous year, on the centre. The left of the Carthaginians was\r\ncommanded by Hasdrubal, the right by Hanno, the centre by Hannibal in\r\nperson, attended by his brother Mago. And as the Roman line faced the\r\nsouth, as I said before, and the Carthaginian the north, the rays of\r\nthe rising sun did not inconvenience either of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle, 2d August, B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans outflanked by the cavalry.]\r\n\r\n+115.+ The battle was begun by an engagement between the advanced guard\r\nof the two armies; and at first the affair between these light-armed\r\ntroops was indecisive. But as soon as the Iberian and Celtic cavalry\r\ngot at the Romans, the battle began in earnest, and in the true\r\nbarbaric fashion: for there was none of the usual formal advance and\r\nretreat; but when they once got to close quarters, they grappled man to\r\nman, and, dismounting from their horses, fought on foot. But when the\r\nCarthaginians had got the upper hand in this encounter and killed most\r\nof their opponents on the ground,— because the Romans all maintained\r\nthe fight with spirit and determination,—and began chasing the\r\nremainder along the river, slaying as they went and giving no quarter;\r\nthen the legionaries took the place of the light-armed and closed with\r\nthe enemy. For a short time the Iberian and Celtic lines stood their\r\nground and fought gallantly; but, presently overpowered by the weight\r\nof the heavy-armed lines, they gave way and retired to the rear, thus\r\nbreaking up the crescent. The Roman maniples followed with spirit, and\r\neasily cut their way through the enemy’s line; since the Celts had been\r\ndrawn up in a thin line, while the Romans had closed up from the wings\r\ntowards the centre and the point of danger. For the two wings did not\r\ncome into action at the same time as the centre: but the centre was\r\nfirst engaged, because the Gauls, having been stationed on the arc of\r\nthe crescent, had come into contact with the enemy long before the\r\nwings, the convex of the crescent being towards the enemy. The Romans,\r\nhowever, going in pursuit of these troops, and hastily closing in\r\ntowards the centre and the part of the enemy which was giving ground,\r\nadvanced so far, that the Libyan heavy-armed troops on either wing got\r\non their flanks. Those on the right, facing to the left, charged from\r\nthe right upon the Roman flank; while those who were on the left wing\r\nfaced to the right, and, dressing by the left, charged their right\r\nflank,[199] the exigency of the moment suggesting to them what they\r\nought to do. Thus it came about, as Hannibal had planned, that the\r\nRomans were caught between two hostile lines of Libyans—thanks to their\r\nimpetuous pursuit of the Celts. Still they fought, though no longer in\r\nline, yet singly, or in maniples, which faced about to meet those who\r\ncharged them on the flanks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Aemilius Paulus.]\r\n\r\n+116.+ Though he had been from the first on the right wing, and had\r\ntaken part in the cavalry engagement, Lucius Aemilius still survived.\r\nDetermined to act up to his own exhortatory speech, and seeing that\r\nthe decision of the battle rested mainly on the legionaries, riding up\r\nto the centre of the line he led the charge himself, and personally\r\ngrappled with the enemy, at the same time cheering on and exhorting\r\nhis soldiers to the charge. Hannibal, on the other side, did the same,\r\nfor he too had taken his place on the centre from the commencement.\r\nThe Numidian horse on the Carthaginian right were meanwhile charging\r\nthe cavalry on the Roman left; and though, from the peculiar nature\r\nof their mode of fighting, they neither inflicted nor received much\r\nharm, they yet rendered the enemy’s horse useless by keeping them\r\noccupied, and charging them first on one side and then on another. But\r\nwhen Hasdrubal, after all but annihilating the cavalry by the river,\r\ncame from the left to the support of the Numidians, the Roman allied\r\ncavalry, seeing his charge approaching, broke and fled. At that point\r\nHasdrubal appears to have acted with great skill and discretion.\r\nSeeing the Numidians to be strong in numbers, and more effective and\r\nformidable to troops that had once been forced from their ground, he\r\nleft the pursuit to them; while he himself hastened to the part of\r\nthe field where the infantry were engaged, and brought his men up to\r\nsupport the Libyans. Then, by charging the Roman legions on the rear,\r\nand harassing them by hurling squadron after squadron upon them at many\r\npoints at once, he raised the spirits of the Libyans, and dismayed\r\nand depressed those of the Romans. It was at this point that Lucius\r\nAemilius fell, in the thick of the fight, covered with wounds: a man\r\nwho did his duty to his country at that last hour of his life, as he\r\nhad throughout its previous years, if any man ever did.[200] As long as\r\nthe Romans could keep an unbroken front, to turn first in one direction\r\nand then in another to meet the assaults of the enemy, they held out;\r\nbut the outer files of the circle continually falling, and the circle\r\nbecoming more and more contracted, they at last were all killed on the\r\nfield, and among them Marcus Atilius and Gnaeus Servilius, the Consuls\r\nof the previous year, who had shown themselves brave men and worthy of\r\nRome in the battle. While this struggle and carnage were going on, the\r\nNumidian horse were pursuing the fugitives, most of whom they cut down\r\nor hurled from their horses; but some few escaped into Venusia, among\r\nwhom was Gaius Terentius, the Consul, who thus sought a flight, as\r\ndisgraceful to himself, as his conduct in office had been disastrous to\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\n+117.+ Such was the end of the battle of Cannae, in which both sides\r\nfought with the most conspicuous gallantry, the conquered no less\r\nthan the conquerors. This is proved by the fact that, out of six\r\nthousand horse, only seventy escaped with Gaius Terentius to Venusia,\r\nand about three hundred of the allied cavalry to various towns in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Of the infantry ten thousand were taken prisoners\r\nin fair fight, but were not actually engaged in the battle: of those\r\nwho were actually engaged only about three thousand perhaps escaped\r\nto the towns of the surrounding district, all the rest died nobly,\r\nto the number of seventy thousand, the Carthaginians being on this\r\noccasion, as on previous ones, mainly indebted for their victory to\r\ntheir superiority in cavalry: a lesson to posterity that in actual war\r\nit is better to have half the number of infantry, and the superiority\r\nin cavalry, than to engage your enemy with an equality in both. On\r\nthe side of Hannibal there fell four thousand Celts, fifteen hundred\r\nIberians and Libyans, and about two hundred horse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Losses of the Romans.]\r\n\r\nThe ten thousand Romans who were captured had not, as I said, been\r\nengaged in the actual battle; and the reason was this. Lucius Aemilius\r\nleft ten thousand infantry in his camp that, in case Hannibal should\r\ndisregard the safety of his own camp, and take his whole army on to the\r\nfield, they might seize the opportunity, while the battle was going on,\r\nof forcing their way in and capturing the enemy’s baggage; or if, on\r\nthe other hand, Hannibal should, in view of this contingency, leave a\r\nguard in his camp, the number of the enemy in the field might thereby\r\nbe diminished. These men were captured in the following circumstances.\r\nHannibal, as a matter of fact, did leave a sufficient guard in his\r\ncamp; and as soon as the battle began, the Romans, according to their\r\ninstructions, assaulted and tried to take those thus left by Hannibal.\r\nAt first they held their own: but just as they were beginning to waver,\r\nHannibal, who was by this time gaining a victory all along the line,\r\ncame to their relief, and routing the Romans, shut them up in their own\r\ncamp; killed two thousand of them; and took all the rest prisoners.\r\nIn like manner the Numidian horse brought in all those who had taken\r\nrefuge in the various strongholds about the district, amounting to two\r\nthousand of the routed cavalry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The results of the battle. Defection of the allies.]\r\n\r\n+118.+ The result of this battle, such as I have described it, had the\r\nconsequences which both sides expected. For the Carthaginians by their\r\nvictory were thenceforth masters of nearly the whole of the Italian\r\ncoast which is called _Magna Graecia_. Thus the Tarentines immediately\r\nsubmitted; and the Arpani and some of the Campanian states invited\r\nHannibal to come to them; and the rest were with one consent turning\r\ntheir eyes to the Carthaginians: who, accordingly, began now to have\r\nhigh hopes of being able to carry even Rome itself by assault.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Lucius Postumius in Gaul. See _supra_, ch. 106.]\r\n\r\nOn their side the Romans, after this disaster, despaired of retaining\r\ntheir supremacy over the Italians, and were in the greatest alarm,\r\nbelieving their own lives and the existence of their city to be in\r\ndanger, and every moment expecting that Hannibal would be upon them.\r\nFor, as though Fortune were in league with the disasters that had\r\nalready befallen them to fill up the measure of their ruin, it happened\r\nthat only a few days afterwards, while the city was still in this\r\npanic, the Praetor who had been sent to Gaul fell unexpectedly into an\r\nambush and perished, and his army was utterly annihilated by the Celts.\r\nIn spite of all, however, the Senate left no means untried to save the\r\nState. It exhorted the people to fresh exertions, strengthened the\r\ncity with guards, and deliberated on the crisis in a brave and manly\r\nspirit. And subsequent events made this manifest. For though the Romans\r\nwere on that occasion indisputably beaten in the field, and had lost\r\nreputation for military prowess; by the peculiar excellence of their\r\npolitical constitution, and the prudence of their counsels, they not\r\nonly recovered their supremacy over Italy, by eventually conquering the\r\nCarthaginians, but before very long became masters of the whole world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\nI shall, therefore, end this book at this point, having now recounted\r\nthe events in Iberia and Italy, embraced by the 140th Olympiad. When\r\nI have arrived at the same period in my history of Greece during this\r\nOlympiad, I shall then fulfil my promise of devoting a book to a\r\nformal account of the Roman constitution itself; for I think that a\r\ndescription of it will not only be germane to the matter of my history,\r\nbut will also be of great help to practical statesmen, as well as\r\nstudents, either in reforming or establishing other constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220-216.]\r\n\r\n+1.+ In my former book I explained the causes of the second war between\r\nRome and Carthage; and described Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, and the\r\nengagements which took place between them up to the battle of Cannae,\r\non the banks of the Aufidus. I shall now take up the history of Greece\r\nduring the same period, ending at the same date, and commencing from\r\nthe 140th Olympiad. But I shall first recall to the recollection of my\r\nreaders what I stated in my second book on the subject of the Greeks,\r\nand especially of the Achaeans; for the league of the latter has made\r\nextraordinary progress up to our own age and the generation immediately\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation of Achaean history, before B.C. 220,\r\ncontained in Book II., cc. 41-71.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ending with the deaths of Antigonus Doson, Seleucus\r\nCeraunus, and Ptolemy Euergetes, before the 140th Olympiad, B.C.\r\n220-216.]\r\n\r\nI started, then, from Tisamenus, one of the sons of Orestes, and\r\nstated that the dynasty existed from his time to that of Ogygus: that\r\nthen there was an excellent form of democratical federal government\r\nestablished: and that then the league was broken up by the kings of\r\nSparta into separate towns and villages. Then I tried to describe how\r\nthese towns began to form a league once more: which were the first to\r\njoin; and the policy subsequently pursued, which led to their inducing\r\nall the Peloponnesians to adopt the general title of Achaeans, and to\r\nbe united under one federal government. Descending to particulars,\r\nI brought my story up to the flight of Cleomenes, King of Sparta:\r\nthen briefly summarising the events included in my prefatory sketch\r\nup to the deaths of Antigonus Doson, Seleucus Ceraunus, and Ptolemy\r\nEuergetes, who all three died at about the same time, I announced that\r\nmy main history was to begin from that point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons for starting from this point. (1.) The fact that the\r\nhistory of Aratus ends at that point. (2.) The possibility of getting\r\ngood evidence. (3.) The changes in the various governments in the 139th\r\nOlympiad. B.C. 224-220.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ I thought this was the best point; first, because it is there that\r\nAratus leaves off, and I meant my work, as far as it was Greek history,\r\nto be a continuation of his; and, secondly, because the period thus\r\nembraced in my history would fall partly in the life of my father, and\r\npartly in my own; and thus I should be able to speak as eye-witness\r\nof some of the events, and from the information of eye-witnesses of\r\nothers. To go further back and write the report of a report, traditions\r\nat second or third hand, seemed to me unsatisfactory either with a\r\nview to giving clear impressions or making sound statements. But,\r\nabove all, I began at this period because it was then that the history\r\nof the whole world entered on a new phase. Philip, son of Demetrius,\r\nhad just become the boy king of Macedonia; Achaeus, prince of Asia on\r\nthis side of Taurus, had converted his show of power into a reality;\r\nAntiochus the Great had, a short time before, by the death of his\r\nbrother Seleucus, succeeded while quite a young man to the throne of\r\nSyria; Ariarathes to that of Cappadocia; and Ptolemy Philopator to that\r\nof Egypt. Not long afterwards Lycurgus became King of Sparta, and the\r\nCarthaginians had recently elected Hannibal general to carry on the\r\nwar lately described. Every government therefore being changed about\r\nthis time, there seemed every likelihood of a new departure in policy:\r\nwhich is but natural and usual, and in fact did at this time occur. For\r\nthe Romans and Carthaginians entered upon the war I have described;\r\nAntiochus and Ptolemy on one for the possession of Coele-Syria; and the\r\nAchaeans and Philip one against the Aetolians and Lacedaemonians. The\r\ncauses of this last war must now be stated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolians.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ The Aetolians had long been discontented with a state of peace and\r\ntired at living at their own charges; for they were accustomed to live\r\non their neighbours, and their natural ostentation required abundant\r\nmeans to support it. Enslaved by this passion they live a life as\r\npredatory as that of wild beasts, respecting no tie of friendship and\r\nregarding every one as an enemy to be plundered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 222.]\r\n\r\nHitherto, however, as long as Antigonus Doson was alive, their fear\r\nof the Macedonians had kept them quiet. But when he was succeeded at\r\nhis death by the boy Philip, they conceived a contempt for the royal\r\npower, and at once began to look out for a pretext and opportunity\r\nfor interfering in the Peloponnese: induced partly by an old habit of\r\ngetting plunder from that country, and partly by the belief that, now\r\nthe Achaeans were unsupported by Macedonia, they would be a match for\r\nthem. While their thoughts were fixed on this, chance to a certain\r\nextent contributed to give them the opportunity which they desired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The raids of Dorimachus in Messenia.]\r\n\r\nThere was a certain man of Trichonium[201] named Dorimachus, son of\r\nthat Nicostratus who made the treacherous attack on the Pan-Boeotian\r\ncongress.[202] This Dorimachus, being young and inspired with the\r\ntrue spirit of Aetolian violence and aggressiveness, was sent by the\r\nstate to Phigalea in the Peloponnese, which, being on the borders of\r\nArcadia and Messenia, happened at that time to be in political union\r\nwith the Aetolian league. His mission was nominally to guard the city\r\nand territory of Phigalea, but in fact to act as a spy on the politics\r\nof the Peloponnese. A crowd of pirates flocked to him at Phigalea;\r\nand being unable to get them any booty by fair means, because the\r\npeace between all Greeks which Antigonus had concluded was still in\r\nforce, he was finally reduced to allowing the pirates to drive off the\r\ncattle of the Messenians, though they were friends and allies of the\r\nAetolians. These injurious acts were at first confined to the sheep on\r\nthe border lands; but becoming more and more reckless and audacious,\r\nthey even ventured to break into the farm-houses by sudden attacks at\r\nnight. The Messenians were naturally indignant, and sent embassies to\r\nDorimachus; which he at first disregarded, because he wanted not only\r\nto benefit the men under him, but himself also, by getting a share\r\nin their spoils. But when the arrival of such embassies became more\r\nand more frequent, owing to the perpetual recurrence of these acts of\r\ndepredation, he said at last that he would come in person to Messene,\r\nand decide on the claims they had to make against the Aetolians.\r\nWhen he came, however, and the sufferers appeared, he laughed at\r\nsome, threatened to strike others, and drove others away with abusive\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorimachus leaves Messene.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ Even while he was actually in Messene, the pirates came close to\r\nthe city walls in the night, and by means of scaling-ladders broke\r\ninto a country-house called Chiron’s villa; killed all the slaves who\r\nresisted them; and having bound the others, took them and the cattle\r\naway with them. The Messenian Ephors had long been much annoyed by\r\nwhat was going on, and by the presence of Dorimachus in their town;\r\nbut this they thought was too insolent: and they accordingly summoned\r\nhim to appear before the assembled magistrates. There Sciron, who\r\nhappened to be an Ephor at the time, and enjoyed a high reputation for\r\nintegrity among his fellow-citizens, advised that they should not allow\r\nDorimachus to leave the city, until he had made good all the losses\r\nsustained by the Messenians, and had given up the guilty persons to\r\nbe punished for the murders committed. This suggestion being received\r\nwith unanimous approval, as but just, Dorimachus passionately exclaimed\r\nthat “they were fools if they imagined that they were now insulting\r\nonly Dorimachus, and not the Aetolian league.” In fact he expressed the\r\ngreatest indignation at the whole affair, and said that “they would\r\nmeet with a public punishment, which would serve them well right.” Now\r\nthere was at that time in Messene a man of disgraceful and effeminate\r\ncharacter named Babyrtas, who was so exactly like Dorimachus in voice\r\nand person, that, when he was dressed in Dorimachus’s sun-hat and\r\ncloak, it was impossible to tell them apart; and of this Dorimachus was\r\nperfectly aware. When therefore he was speaking in these threatening\r\nand insolent tones to the Messenian magistrates, Sciron lost his temper\r\nand said “Do you think we care for you or your threats, _Babyrtas_?”\r\nAfter this Dorimachus was compelled for the present to yield to\r\ncircumstances, and to give satisfaction for the injuries inflicted\r\nupon the Messenians: but when he returned to Aetolia, he nursed such a\r\nbitter and furious feeling of anger at this taunt, that, without any\r\nother reasonable pretext, but for this cause and this alone, he got up\r\na war against the Messenians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorimachus becomes practically Strategus of Aetolia, B.C.\r\n221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: He induces Scopas to go to war with Messenia, Epirus,\r\nAchaia, Acarnania, and Macedonia.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ The Strategus of the Aetolians at that time was Ariston; but\r\nbeing from physical infirmities unable to serve in the field, and\r\nbeing a kinsman of Dorimachus and Scopas, he had somehow or another\r\nsurrendered his whole authority to the former. In his public capacity\r\nDorimachus could not venture to urge the Aetolians to undertake the\r\nMessenian war, because he had no reasonable pretext for so doing:\r\nthe origin of his wish being, as everybody well knew, the wrongs\r\ncommitted by himself and the bitter gibe which they had brought upon\r\nhim. He therefore gave up the idea of publicly advocating the war, but\r\ntried privately to induce Scopas to join in the intrigue against the\r\nMessenians: He pointed out that there was now no danger from the side\r\nof Macedonia owing to the youth of the king (Philip being then only\r\nseventeen years old); that the Lacedaemonians were alienated from the\r\nMessenians; and that they possessed the affection and alliance of the\r\nEleans; and these circumstances taken together would make an invasion\r\nof Messenia perfectly safe. But the argument most truly Aetolian which\r\nhe used was to put before him that a great booty was to be got from\r\nMessenia, because it was entirely unguarded, and had alone, of all the\r\nPeloponnesian districts, remained unravaged throughout the Cleomenic\r\nwar. And, to sum up all, he argued that such a move would secure them\r\ngreat popularity with the Aetolians generally. And if the Achaeans were\r\nto try to hinder their march through the country, they would not be\r\nable to complain if they retaliated: and if, on the other hand, they\r\ndid not stir, would be no hindrance to their enterprise. Besides, he\r\naffirmed that they would have plenty of pretext against the Messenians;\r\nfor they had long been in the position of aggressors by promising the\r\nAchaeans and Macedonians to join their alliance.\r\n\r\nBy these, and similar arguments to the same effect, he roused such\r\na strong feeling in the minds of Scopas and his friends, that,\r\nwithout waiting for a meeting of the Aetolian federal assembly, and\r\nwithout communicating with the Apocleti or taking any of the proper\r\nconstitutional steps, of their own mere impulse and opinion they\r\ncommitted acts of hostility simultaneously against Messenia, Epirus,\r\nAchaia, Acarnania, and Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acts of hostility against Macedonia,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Epirus, and Acarnania.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ By sea they immediately sent out privateers, who, falling in\r\nwith a royal vessel of Macedonia near Cythera, brought it with all\r\nits crew to Aetolia, and sold ship-owners, sailors, and marines, and\r\nfinally the ship itself. Then they began sacking the seaboard of\r\nEpirus, employing the aid of some Cephallenian ships for carrying out\r\nthis act of violence. They tried also to capture Thyrium in Acarnania.\r\nAt the same time they secretly sent some men to seize a strong place\r\ncalled Clarium, in the centre of the territory of Megalopolis; which\r\nthey used thenceforth as a place of sale for their spoils, and a\r\nstarting place for their marauding expeditions. However Timoxenus, the\r\nAchaean Strategus, with the assistance of Taurion, who had been left\r\nby Antigonus in charge of the Macedonian interests in the Peloponnese,\r\ntook the place after a siege of a very few days. For Antigonus retained\r\nCorinth, in accordance with his convention with the Achaeans, made at\r\nthe time of the Cleomenic war;[203] and had never restored Orchomenus\r\nto the Achaeans after he had taken it by force, but claimed and\r\nretained it in his own hands; with the view, as I suppose, not only of\r\ncommanding the entrance of the Peloponnese, but of guarding also its\r\ninterior by means of his garrison and warlike apparatus in Orchomenus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Before midsummer B.C. 220. Invasion of Messenia by\r\nDorimachus and Scopas.]\r\n\r\nDorimachus and Scopas waited until Timoxenus had a very short time of\r\noffice left, and when Aratus, though elected by the Achaeans for the\r\ncoming year, would not yet be in office;[204] and then collecting a\r\ngeneral levy of Aetolians at Rhium, and preparing means of transport,\r\nwith some Cephallenian ships ready to convoy them, they got their\r\nmen across to the Peloponnese, and led them against Messenia. While\r\nmarching through the territories of Patrae, Pharae, and Tritaea they\r\npretended that they did not wish to do any injury to the Achaeans;\r\nbut their forces, from their inveterate passion for plunder, could\r\nnot be restrained from robbing the country; and consequently they\r\ncommitted outrages and acts of violence all along their line of march,\r\ntill they arrived at Phigalea. Thence, by a bold and sudden movement,\r\nthey entered Messenia; and without any regard for their ancient\r\nfriendship and alliance with the Messenians, or for the principles\r\nof international justice common to all mankind, subordinating every\r\nconsideration to their selfish greed, they set about plundering the\r\ncountry without resistance, the Messenians being absolutely afraid to\r\ncome out to attack them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaean league decide to assist the Messenians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 222-221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus becomes Strategus of the Achaean league, B.C. 220\r\n(May-June).]\r\n\r\n+7.+ This being the time, according to their laws, for the meeting\r\nof the Achaean federal assembly, the members arrived at Aegium. When\r\nthe assembly met, the deputies from Patrae and Pharae made a formal\r\nstatement of the injuries inflicted upon their territories during the\r\npassage of the Aetolians: an embassy from Messenia also appeared,\r\nbegging for their assistance on the ground that the treatment from\r\nwhich they were suffering was unjust and in defiance of treaty.\r\nWhen these statements were heard, great indignation was felt at the\r\nwrongs of Patrae and Pharae, and great sympathy for the misfortunes\r\nof the Messenians. But it was regarded as especially outrageous that\r\nthe Aetolians should have ventured to enter Achaia with an army,\r\ncontrary to treaty, without obtaining or even asking for permission\r\nfrom any one to pass through the country. Roused to indignation by\r\nall these considerations, the assembly voted to give assistance to\r\nthe Messenians: that the Strategus should summon a general levy of\r\nthe Achaean arms: and that whatever was decided by this levy, when it\r\nmet, should be done. Now Timoxenus, the existing Strategus, was just\r\non the point of quitting office, and felt besides small confidence\r\nin the Achaeans, because martial exercise had been allowed to fall\r\ninto neglect among them; he therefore shrank from undertaking the\r\nexpedition, or from even summoning the popular levy. The fact was that,\r\nafter the expulsion of Cleomenes, King of Sparta, the Peloponnesians,\r\nweary of the wars that had taken place, and trusting to the peaceful\r\narrangement that had been come to, neglected all warlike preparations.\r\nAratus, however, indignant and incensed at the audacity of the\r\nAetolians, was not inclined to take things so calmly, for he had in\r\nfact a grudge of long standing against these people. Wherefore he\r\nwas for instantly summoning the Achaeans to an armed levy, and was\r\nall eagerness to attack the Aetolians. Eventually he took over from\r\nTimoxenus the seal of the league, five days before the proper time,\r\nand wrote to the various cities summoning a meeting in arms of all\r\nthose who were of the military age, at Megalopolis. But the peculiar\r\ncharacter of this man, I think, makes it proper for me to give a brief\r\npreliminary sketch of him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ Aratus had many of the qualities of a great ruler. He could\r\nspeak, and contrive, and conceal his purpose: no one surpassed him\r\nin the moderation which he showed in political contests, or in his\r\npower of attaching friends and gaining allies: in intrigue, stratagem,\r\nand laying plots against a foe, and in bringing them to a successful\r\ntermination by personal endurance and courage, he was pre-eminent.\r\nMany clear instances of these qualities may be found; but none more\r\nconvincing than the episodes of the capture of Sicyon and Mantinea,\r\nof the expulsion of the Aetolians from Pellene, and especially of the\r\nsurprise of the Acrocorinthus.[205] On the other hand whenever he\r\nattempted a campaign in the field, he was slow in conception and timid\r\nin execution, and without personal gallantry in the presence of danger.\r\nThe result was that the Peloponnese was full of trophies which marked\r\nreverses sustained by him; and that in this particular department he\r\nwas always easily defeated. So true is it that men’s minds, no less\r\nthan their bodies, have many aspects. Not only is it the case that\r\nthe same man has an aptitude for one class of activities and not\r\nfor another; it often happens that in things closely analogous, the\r\nsame man will be exceedingly acute and exceedingly dull, exceedingly\r\ncourageous and exceedingly timid. Nor is this a paradox: it is a very\r\nordinary fact, well known to all attentive observers. For instance you\r\nmay find men who in hunting show the greatest daring in grappling with\r\nwild beasts, and yet are utter cowards in the presence of an armed\r\nenemy. Or again, in actual war some are active and skilful in single\r\ncombats, who are yet quite ineffective in the ranks. For example, the\r\nThessalian cavalry in squadron and column are irresistible, but when\r\ntheir order is once broken up, they have not the skill in skirmishing\r\nby which each man does whatever the time and place suggests: while,\r\non the other hand, exactly the reverse of this is the case with the\r\nAetolians. The Cretans, again, either by land or sea, in ambushes and\r\npiratical excursions, in deceiving the enemy, in making night attacks,\r\nand in fact in every service which involves craft and separate action,\r\nare irresistible; but for a regular front to front charge in line they\r\nhave neither the courage nor firmness; and the reverse again is the\r\ncase with the Achaeans and Macedonians.\r\n\r\nI have said thus much, that my readers may not refuse me credit if I\r\nhave at times to make contradictory statements about the same men and\r\nin regard to analogous employments. To return to my narrative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The armed levy of Achaeans summoned.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorimachus ordered to quit Messenia without passing through\r\nAchaia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scopas and Dorimachus prepare to obey.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ The men of military age having assembled in arms at Megalopolis,\r\nin accordance with the decree of the federal assembly, the Messenian\r\nenvoys once more came forward, and entreated the people not to\r\ndisregard the flagrant breach of treaty from which they were suffering;\r\nand expressed their willingness to become allies of the league, and\r\ntheir anxiety to be enrolled among its members. The Achaean magistrates\r\ndeclined the offered alliance, on the ground that it was impossible\r\nto admit a new member without the concurrence of Philip and the other\r\nallies,—for the sworn alliance negotiated by Antigonus during the\r\nCleomenic war was still in force, and included Achaia, Epirus, Phocis,\r\nMacedonia, Boeotia, Acarnania, and Thessaly;—but they said that they\r\nwould march out to their relief, if the envoys there present would\r\nplace their sons in Sparta, as hostages for their promise not to make\r\nterms with the Aetolians without the consent of the Achaeans. The\r\nSpartans among the rest were encamped on the frontier of Megalopolis,\r\nhaving marched out in accordance with the terms of their alliance;\r\nbut they were acting rather as reserves and spectators than as active\r\nallies. Having thus settled the terms of the arrangement with the\r\nMessenians, Aratus sent a messenger to the Aetolians to inform them\r\nof the decree of the Achaean federation, and to order them to quit\r\nthe territory of Messenia without entering that of Achaia, on pain of\r\nbeing treated as enemies if they set foot in it. When they heard the\r\nmessage and knew that the Achaeans were mustered in force, Scopas and\r\nDorimachus thought it best for the present to obey. They therefore at\r\nonce sent despatches to Cyllene and to the Aetolian Strategus, Ariston,\r\nbegging that the transports should be sent to a place on the coast of\r\nElis called the island of Pheia;[206] and they themselves two days\r\nlater struck camp, and laden with booty marched towards Elis. For the\r\nAetolians always maintained a friendship with the Eleans that they\r\nmight have through them an entrance for their plundering and piratical\r\nexpeditions into the Peloponnese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus dismisses the Achaean levy, with the exception of\r\n3000 foot and 300 horse.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorimachus turns upon Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ Aratus waited two days: and then, foolishly believing that the\r\nAetolians would return by the route they had indicated, he dismissed\r\nall the Achaeans and Lacedaemonians to their homes, except three\r\nthousand foot and three hundred horse and the division under Taurion,\r\nwhich he led to Patrae, with the view of keeping on the flank of the\r\nAetolians. But when Dorimachus learnt that Aratus was thus watching his\r\nmarch, and was still under arms; partly from fear of being attacked\r\nwhen his forces were engaged on the embarkation, and partly with a\r\nview to confuse the enemy, he sent his booty on to the transports\r\nwith a sufficient number of men to secure their passage, under orders\r\nto meet him at Rhium where he intended to embark; while he himself,\r\nafter remaining for a time to superintend and protect the shipment of\r\nthe booty, changed the direction of his march and advanced towards\r\nOlympia. But hearing that Taurion, with the rest of the army, was\r\nnear Cleitoria; and feeling sure that in these circumstances he would\r\nnot be able to effect the crossing from Rhium without danger and a\r\nstruggle with the enemy; he made up his mind that it would be best for\r\nhis interests to bring on an engagement with the army of Aratus as\r\nsoon as possible, since it was weak in numbers and wholly unprepared\r\nfor the attack. He calculated that if he could defeat this force, he\r\ncould then plunder the country, and effect his crossing from Rhium in\r\nsafety, while Aratus was waiting and deliberating about again convoking\r\nthe Achaean levy; but if on the other hand Aratus were terrified and\r\ndeclined the engagement, he would then effect his departure unmolested,\r\nwhenever he thought it advisable. With these views, therefore, he\r\nadvanced, and pitched his camp at Methydrium in the territory of\r\nMegalopolis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle of Caphyae, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ But the leaders of the Achaeans, on learning the arrival of the\r\nAetolians, adopted a course of proceeding quite unsurpassable for\r\nfolly. They left the territory of Cleitor and encamped at Caphyae; but\r\nthe Aetolians marching from Methydrium past the city of Orchomenus,\r\nthey led the Achaean troops into the plain of Caphyae, and there drew\r\nthem up for battle, with the river which flows through that plain\r\nprotecting their front. The difficulty of the ground between them and\r\ntheir enemy, for there were besides the river a number of ditches\r\nnot easily crossed,[207] and the show of readiness on the part of\r\nthe Achaeans for the engagement, caused the Aetolians to shrink from\r\nattacking according to their original purpose; but they retreated in\r\ngood order to the high ground of Oligyrtus, content if only they were\r\nnot attacked and forced to give battle. But Aratus, when the van of\r\nthe Aetolians was already making the ascent, while the cavalry were\r\nbringing up the rear along the plain, and were approaching a place\r\ncalled Propus at the foot of the hills, sent out his cavalry and\r\nlight-armed troops, under the command of Epistratus of Acarnania, with\r\norders to attack and harass the enemy’s rear. Now if an engagement was\r\nnecessary at all, they ought not to have attempted it with the enemy’s\r\nrear, when they had already accomplished the march through the plain,\r\nbut with his van directly it had debouched upon the plain: for in this\r\nway the battle would have been wholly confined to the plain and level\r\nground, where the peculiar nature of the Aetolian arms and general\r\ntactics would have been least effective; while the Achaeans, from\r\nprecisely opposite reasons, would have been most effective and able to\r\nact. As it was, they surrendered the advantages of time and place which\r\nwere in their favour, and deliberately accepted the conditions which\r\nwere in favour of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaeans defeated.]\r\n\r\n+12.+ Naturally the result of the engagement was in harmony with such\r\na beginning. For when the light-armed troops approached, the Aetolian\r\ncavalry retired in good order up the hill, being anxious to effect\r\na junction with their own infantry. But Aratus, having an imperfect\r\nview of what was going on, and making a bad conjecture of what would\r\nhappen next, no sooner saw the cavalry retiring, than, hoping that they\r\nwere in absolute flight, he sent forward the heavy-armed troops of\r\nhis two wings, with orders to join and support the advanced guard of\r\ntheir light-armed troops; while he himself, with his remaining forces,\r\nexecuted a flank movement, and led his men on at the double. But the\r\nAetolian cavalry had now cleared the plain, and, having effected the\r\njunction with their infantry, drew up under cover of the hill; massed\r\nthe infantry on their flanks; and called to them to stand by them:\r\nthe infantry themselves showing great promptness in answering to\r\ntheir shouts, and in coming to their relief, as the several companies\r\narrived. Thinking themselves now sufficiently strong in numbers, they\r\nclosed their ranks, and charged the advanced guard of Achaean cavalry\r\nand light armed troops; and being superior in number, and having the\r\nadvantage of charging from higher ground, after a long struggle, they\r\nfinally turned their opponents to flight: whose flight involved that\r\nof the heavy-armed troops also which were coming to their relief. For\r\nthe latter were advancing in separate detachments in loose order, and,\r\neither in dismay at what was happening, or upon meeting their flying\r\ncomrades on their retreat, were compelled to follow their example: the\r\nresult being that, whereas the number of those actually defeated on the\r\nfield was less than five hundred, the number that fled was more than\r\ntwo thousand. Taught by experience what to do, the Aetolians followed\r\nbehind them with round after round of loud and boisterous shouts. The\r\nAchaeans at first retreated in good order and without danger, because\r\nthey were retiring upon their heavy-armed troops, whom they imagined\r\nto be in a place of safety on their original ground; but when they\r\nsaw that these too had abandoned their position of safety, and were\r\nmarching in a long straggling line, some of them immediately broke\r\noff from the main body and sought refuge in various towns in the\r\nneighbourhood; while others, meeting the phalanx as it was coming up to\r\ntheir relief, proved to be quite sufficient, without the presence of an\r\nenemy, to strike fear into it and force it into headlong flight. They\r\ndirected their flight, as I said, to the towns of the neighbourhood.\r\nOrchomenus and Caphyae, which were close by, saved large numbers of\r\nthem: and if this had not been the case, they would in all probability\r\nhave been annihilated by this unlooked-for catastrophe. Such was the\r\nresult of the engagement at Caphyae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolians retire at their leisure.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ When the people of Megalopolis learnt that the Aetolians were\r\nat Methydrium, they came to the rescue _en masse_, at the summons\r\nof a trumpet, on the very day after the battle of Caphyae; and were\r\ncompelled to bury the very men with whose assistance they had expected\r\nto fight the Aetolians. Having therefore dug a trench in the territory\r\nof Caphyae, and collected the corpses, they performed the funeral rites\r\nof these unhappy men with all imaginable honour. But the Aetolians,\r\nafter this unlooked-for success gained by the cavalry and light-armed\r\ntroops, traversed the Peloponnese from that time in complete security.\r\nIn the course of their march they made an attack upon the town of\r\nPellene, and, after ravaging the territory of Sicyon, finally quitted\r\nthe Peloponnese by way of the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nThis then, was the cause and occasion of the Social war: its formal\r\nbeginning was the decree passed by all the allies after these events,\r\nwhich was confirmed by a general meeting held at Corinth, on the\r\nproposal of King Philip, who presided at the assembly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Midsummer, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attacked at the Achaean Congress, Aratus successfully\r\ndefends himself.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ A few days after the events just narrated the ordinary meeting\r\nof the Achaean federal assembly took place, and Aratus was bitterly\r\ndenounced, publicly as well as privately, as indisputably responsible\r\nfor this disaster; and the anger of the general public was still\r\nfurther roused and embittered by the invectives of his political\r\nopponents. It was shown to every one’s satisfaction that Aratus had\r\nbeen guilty of four flagrant errors. His first was that, having taken\r\noffice before his predecessor’s time was legally at an end, he had\r\navailed himself of a time properly belonging to another to engage\r\nin the sort of enterprise in which he was conscious of having often\r\nfailed. His second and graver error was the disbanding the Achaeans,\r\nwhile the Aetolians were still in the middle of the Peloponnese;\r\nespecially as he had been well aware beforehand that Scopas and\r\nDorimachus were anxious to disturb the existing settlement, and to stir\r\nup war. His third error was to engage the enemy, as he did, with such a\r\nsmall force, without any strong necessity; when he might have retired\r\nto the neighbouring towns and have summoned a levy of the Achaeans, and\r\nthen have engaged, if he had thought that measure absolutely necessary.\r\nBut his last and gravest error was that, having determined to fight,\r\nhe did so in such an ill-considered manner, and managed the business\r\nwith so little circumspection, as to deprive himself of the advantages\r\nof the plain and the support of his heavy-armed troops, and allow\r\nthe battle to be settled by light-armed troops, and to take place on\r\nthe slopes, than which nothing could have been more advantageous or\r\nconvenient to the Aetolians. Such were the allegations against Aratus.\r\nHe, however, came forward and reminded the assembly of his former\r\npolitical services and achievements; and urged in his defence that,\r\nin the matters alleged, his was not the blame for what had occurred.\r\nHe begged their indulgence if he had been guilty of any oversight\r\nin the battle, and claimed that they should at any rate look at the\r\nfacts without prejudice or passion. These words created such a rapid\r\nand generous change in the popular feeling, that great indignation\r\nwas roused against the political opponents who attacked him; and the\r\nresolutions as to the measures to be taken in the future were passed\r\nwholly in accordance with the views of Aratus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaean league determine upon war with the Aetolians,\r\nand send round to their allies for assistance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 139th Olympiad, B.C. 224-220; 140th Olympiad, B.C. 220-216.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ These events occurred in the previous Olympiad,[208] what I am\r\nnow going to relate belong to the 140th. The resolutions passed by the\r\nAchaean federal assembly were these. That embassies should be sent to\r\nEpirus, Boeotia, Phocis, Acarnania, and Philip, to declare how the\r\nAetolians, in defiance of treaty, had twice entered Achaia with arms,\r\nand to call upon them for assistance in virtue of their agreement,\r\nand for their consent to the admission of the Messenians into the\r\nalliance. Next, that the Strategus of the Achaeans should enrol five\r\nthousand foot and five hundred horse, and support the Messenians in\r\ncase the Aetolians were to invade their territory; and to arrange\r\nwith the Lacedaemonians and Messenians how many horse and foot were\r\nto be supplied by them severally for the service of the league. These\r\ndecrees showed a noble spirit on the part of the Achaeans in the\r\npresence of defeat, which prevented them from abandoning either the\r\ncause of the Messenians or their own purpose. Those who were appointed\r\nto serve on these embassies to the allies proceeded to carry them out;\r\nwhile the Strategus at once, in accordance with the decree, set about\r\nenrolling the troops from Achaia, and arranged with the Lacedaemonians\r\nand Messenians to supply each two thousand five hundred infantry and\r\ntwo hundred and fifty cavalry, so that the whole army for the coming\r\ncampaign should amount to ten thousand foot and a thousand horse.\r\n\r\nOn the day of their regular assembly the Aetolians also met and decided\r\nto maintain peace with the Spartans and Messenians; hoping by that\r\ncrafty measure to tamper with the loyalty of the Achaean allies and\r\nsow disunion among them. With the Achaeans themselves they voted to\r\nmaintain peace, on condition that they withdrew from alliance with\r\nMessenia, and to proclaim war if they refused,—than which nothing could\r\nhave been more unreasonable. For being themselves in alliance, both\r\nwith Achaeans and Messenians, they proclaimed war against the former,\r\nunless the two ceased to be in alliance and friendly relationship\r\nwith each other; while if the Achaeans chose to be at enmity with the\r\nMessenians, they offered them a separate peace. Their proposition was\r\ntoo iniquitous and unreasonable to admit of being even considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treachery of the Spartans.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ The Epirotes and King Philip on hearing the ambassadors consented\r\nto admit the Messenians to alliance; but though the conduct of the\r\nAetolians caused them momentary indignation, they were not excessively\r\nmoved by it, because it was no more than what the Aetolians habitually\r\ndid. Their anger, therefore, was short-lived, and they presently\r\nvoted against going to war with them. So true is it that an habitual\r\ncourse of wrong-doing finds readier pardon than when it is spasmodic\r\nor isolated. The former, at any rate, was the case with the Aetolians:\r\nthey perpetually plundered Greece, and levied unprovoked war upon many\r\nof its people: they did not deign either to make any defence to those\r\nwho complained, but answered only by additional insults if any one\r\nchallenged them to arbitration for injuries which they had inflicted,\r\nor indeed which they meditated inflicting. And yet the Lacedaemonians,\r\nwho had but recently been liberated by means of Antigonus and the\r\ngenerous zeal of the Achaeans, and though they were bound not to\r\ncommit any act of hostility towards the Macedonians and Philip, sent\r\nclandestine messages to the Aetolians, and arranged a secret treaty of\r\nalliance and friendship with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Invasion of Achaia by the Aetolians and Illyrians.]\r\n\r\nThe army had already been enrolled from the Achaeans of military age,\r\nand had been assigned to the duty of assisting the Lacedaemonians and\r\nMessenians, when Scerdilaidas and Demetrius of Pharos sailed with\r\nninety galleys beyond Lissus, contrary to the terms of their treaty\r\nwith Rome. These men first touched at Pylos, and failing in an attack\r\nupon it, they separated: Demetrius making for the Cyclades, from some\r\nof which he exacted money and plundered others; while Scerdilaidas,\r\ndirecting his course homewards, put in at Naupactus with forty galleys\r\nat the instigation of Amynas, king of the Athamanes, who happened to be\r\nhis brother-in-law; and after making an agreement with the Aetolians,\r\nby the agency of Agelaus, for a division of spoils, he promised to\r\njoin them in their invasion of Achaia. With this agreement made with\r\nScerdilaidas, and with the co-operation of the city of Cynaetha,\r\nAgelaus, Dorimachus, and Scopas, collected a general levy of the\r\nAetolians, and invaded Achaia in conjunction with the Illyrians.\r\n\r\n+17.+ But the Aetolian Strategus Ariston, ignoring everything that was\r\ngoing on, remained quietly at home, asserting that he was not at war\r\nwith the Achaeans, but was maintaining peace: a foolish and childish\r\nmode of acting,—for what better epithets could be applied to a man who\r\nsupposed that he could cloak notorious facts by mere words? Meanwhile\r\nDorimachus and his colleague had marched through the Achaean territory\r\nand suddenly appeared at Cynaetha.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The previous history of Cynaetha.]\r\n\r\nCynaetha was an Arcadian city[209] which, for many years past, had\r\nbeen afflicted with implacable and violent political factions. The\r\ntwo parties had frequently retaliated on each other with massacres,\r\nbanishments, confiscations, and redivisions of lands; but finally the\r\nparty which affected the Achaean connexion prevailed and got possession\r\nof the city, securing themselves by a city-guard and commandant from\r\nAchaia. This was the state of affairs when, shortly before the Aetolian\r\ninvasion, the exiled party sent to the party in possession intreating\r\nthat they would be reconciled and allow them to return to their own\r\ncity; whereupon the latter were persuaded, and sent an embassy to the\r\nAchaeans with the view of obtaining their consent to the pacification.\r\nThe Achaeans readily consented, in the belief that both parties would\r\nregard them with goodwill: since the party in possession had all\r\ntheir hopes centred in the Achaeans, while those who were about to be\r\nrestored would owe that restoration to the consent of the same people.\r\nAccordingly the Cynaethans dismissed the city guard and commandant,\r\nand restored the exiles, to the number of nearly three hundred, after\r\ntaking such pledges from them as are reckoned the most inviolable among\r\nall mankind. But no sooner had they secured their return, than, without\r\nany cause or pretext arising which might give a colour to the renewal\r\nof the quarrel, but on the contrary, at the very first moment of their\r\nrestoration, they began plotting against their country, and against\r\nthose who had been their preservers. I even believe that at the very\r\nsacrifices, which consecrated the oaths and pledges which they gave\r\neach other, they were already, even at such a solemn moment, revolving\r\nin their minds this offence against religion and those who had trusted\r\nthem. For, as soon as they were restored to their civil rights they\r\ncalled in the Aetolians, and betrayed the city into their hands, eager\r\nto effect the utter ruin both of the people who had preserved, and the\r\ncity which had nourished, them.\r\n\r\n+18.+ The bold stroke by which they actually consummated this treason\r\nwas as follows. Of the restored exiles certain officers had been\r\nappointed called Polemarchs, whose duty it was to lock the city-gates,\r\nand keep the keys while they remained closed, and also to be on guard\r\nduring the day at the gate-houses. The Aetolians accordingly waited\r\nfor this period of closing the gates, ready to make the attempt, and\r\nprovided with ladders; while the Polemarchs of the exiles, having\r\nassassinated their colleagues on guard at the gate-house, opened the\r\ngate. Some of the Aetolians, therefore, got into the town by it, while\r\nothers applied their ladders to the walls, and mounting by their\r\nmeans, took forcible possession of them. The inhabitants of the town,\r\npanic-stricken at the occurrence, could not tell which way to turn.\r\nThey could not give their undivided energies to opposing the party\r\nwhich was forcing its way through the gate, because of those who were\r\nattacking them at the walls; nor could they defend the walls owing to\r\nthe enemies that were pouring through the gate. The Aetolians having\r\nthus become rapidly masters of the town, in spite of the injustice of\r\nthe whole proceeding, did one act of supreme justice. For the very men\r\nwho had invited them, and betrayed the town to them, they massacred\r\nbefore any one else, and plundered their property. They then treated\r\nall the others of the party in the same way; and, finally, taking\r\nup their quarters in the houses, they systematically robbed them\r\nof all valuables, and in many cases put Cynaethans to the rack, if\r\nthey suspected them of having anything concealed, whether money, or\r\nfurniture, or anything else of unusual value.\r\n\r\nAfter inflicting this ruin on the Cynaethans they departed, leaving a\r\ngarrison to guard the walls, and marched towards Lusi. Arrived at the\r\ntemple of Artemis, which lies between Cleitor and Cynaetha, and is\r\nregarded as inviolable by the Greeks, they threatened to plunder the\r\ncattle of the goddess and the other property round the temple. But the\r\npeople of Lusi acted with great prudence: they gave the Aetolians some\r\nof the sacred furniture, and appealed to them not to commit the impiety\r\nof inflicting any outrage. The gift was accepted, and the Aetolians at\r\nonce removed to Cleitor and pitched their camp under its walls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Measures taken by Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ Meanwhile Aratus, the Achaean Strategus, had despatched an appeal\r\nfor help to Philip; was collecting the men selected for service; and\r\nwas sending for the troops, arranged for by virtue of the treaty, from\r\nSparta and Messenia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolians at the temple of Artemis. They fail at\r\nCleitor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They burn Cynaetha and return home.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Demetrius of Pharos.]\r\n\r\nThe Aetolians at first urged the people of Cleitor to abandon their\r\nalliance with the Achaeans and adopt one with themselves; and upon\r\nthe Cleitorians absolutely refusing, they began an assault upon the\r\ntown, and endeavoured to take it by an escalade. But meeting with a\r\nbold and determined resistance from the inhabitants, they desisted\r\nfrom the attempt; and breaking up their camp marched back to Cynaetha,\r\ndriving off with them on their route the cattle of the goddess. They\r\nat first offered the city to the Eleans, but upon their refusing to\r\naccept it, they determined to keep the town in their own hands, and\r\nappointed Euripides to command it: but subsequently, on the alarm of\r\nan army of relief coming from Macedonia, they set fire to the town and\r\nabandoned it, directing their march to Rhium with the purpose of there\r\ntaking ship and crossing home. But when Taurion heard of the Aetolian\r\ninvasion, and what had taken place at Cynaetha, and saw that Demetrius\r\nof Pharos had sailed into Cenchreae from his island expedition, he\r\nurged the latter to assist the Achaeans, and dragging his galleys\r\nacross the Isthmus to attack the Aetolians as they crossed the gulf.\r\nNow though Demetrius had enriched himself by his island expedition,\r\nhe had had to beat an ignominious retreat, owing to the Rhodians\r\nputting out to sea to attack him: he was therefore glad to accede to\r\nthe request of Taurion, as the latter undertook the expense of having\r\nhis galleys dragged across the Isthmus.[210] He accordingly got them\r\nacross, and arriving two days after the passage of the Aetolians,\r\nplundered some places on the seaboard of Aetolia and then returned to\r\nCorinth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treason of the Spartans.]\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians had dishonourably failed to send the full complement\r\nof men to which they were bound by their engagement, but had despatched\r\na small contingent only of horse and foot, to save appearances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inactivity of Aratus.]\r\n\r\nAratus however, having his Achaean troops, behaved in this instance\r\nalso with the caution of a statesman, rather than the promptness of a\r\ngeneral: for remembering his previous failure he remained inactively\r\nwatching events, until Scopas and Dorimachus had accomplished all they\r\nwanted and were safe home again; although they had marched through a\r\nline of country which was quite open to attack, full of defiles, and\r\nwanting only a trumpeter[211] to sound a call to arms. But the great\r\ndisaster and misfortunes endured by the Cynaethans at the hands of the\r\nAetolians were looked upon as most richly deserved by them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reasons of the barbarity of the Cynaethans. Their\r\nneglect of the refining influences of music, which is carefully\r\nencouraged in the rest of Arcadia.]\r\n\r\n+20.+ Now, seeing that the Arcadians as a whole have a reputation for\r\nvirtue throughout Greece, not only in respect of their hospitality and\r\nhumanity, but especially for their scrupulous piety, it seems worth\r\nwhile to investigate briefly the barbarous character of the Cynaethans:\r\nand inquire how it came about that, though indisputably Arcadians in\r\nrace, they at that time so far surpassed the rest of Greece in cruelty\r\nand contempt of law.\r\n\r\nThey seem then to me to be the first, and indeed the only, Arcadians\r\nwho have abandoned institutions nobly conceived by their ancestors and\r\nadmirably adapted to the character of all the inhabitants of Arcadia.\r\nFor music, and I mean by that _true_ music, which it is advantageous\r\nto every one to practise, is obligatory with the Arcadians. For we\r\nmust not think, as Ephorus in a hasty sentence of his preface, wholly\r\nunworthy of him, says, that music was introduced among mankind for the\r\npurpose of deception and jugglery; nor must the ancients Cretans and\r\nSpartans be supposed to have introduced the pipe and rhythmic movement\r\nin war, instead of the trumpet, without some reason; nor the early\r\nArcadians to have given music such a high place in their constitution,\r\nthat not only boys, but young men up to the age of thirty, are\r\ncompelled to practise it, though in other respects most simple and\r\nprimitive in their manner of life. Every one is familiarly acquainted\r\nwith the fact that the Arcadians are the only people among whom boys\r\nare by the laws trained from infancy to sing hymns and paeans, in which\r\nthey celebrate in the traditional fashion the heroes and gods of their\r\nparticular towns. They next learn the airs of Philoxenus and Timotheus,\r\nand dance with great spirit to the pipers at the yearly Dionysia in the\r\ntheatres, the boys at the boys’ festival, and the young men at what\r\nis called the men’s festival. Similarly it is their universal custom,\r\nat all festal gatherings and banquets, not to have strangers to make\r\nthe music, but to produce it themselves, calling on each other in turn\r\nfor a song. They do not look upon it as a disgrace to disclaim the\r\npossession of any other accomplishment: but no one can disclaim the\r\nknowledge of how to sing, because all are forced to learn, nor can they\r\nconfess the knowledge, and yet excuse themselves from practising it,\r\nbecause that too among them is looked upon as disgraceful. Their young\r\nmen again practise a military step to the music of the pipe and in\r\nregular order of battle, producing elaborate dances, which they display\r\nto their fellow-citizens every year in the theatres, at the public\r\ncharge and expense.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The object of the musical training of the Arcadians.]\r\n\r\n+21.+ Now the object of the ancient Arcadians in introducing these\r\ncustoms was not, as I think, the gratification of luxury and\r\nextravagance. They saw that Arcadia was a nation of workers; that the\r\nlife of the people was laborious and hard; and that, as a natural\r\nconsequence of the coldness and gloom which were the prevailing\r\nfeatures of a great part of the country, the general character of the\r\npeople was austere. For we mortals have an irresistible tendency to\r\nyield to climatic influences: and to this cause, and no other, may be\r\ntraced the great distinctions which prevail amongst us in character,\r\nphysical formation, and complexion, as well as in most of our habits,\r\nvarying with nationality or wide local separation. And it was with a\r\nview of softening and tempering this natural ruggedness and rusticity,\r\nthat they not only introduced the things which I have mentioned,\r\nbut also the custom of holding assemblies and frequently offering\r\nsacrifices, in both of which women took part equally with men; and\r\nhaving mixed dances of girls and boys and in fact did everything they\r\ncould to humanise their souls by the civilising and softening influence\r\nof such culture. The people of Cynaetha entirely neglected these\r\nthings, although they needed them more than any one else, because their\r\nclimate and country is by far the most unfavourable in all Arcadia;\r\nand on the contrary gave their whole minds to mutual animosities and\r\ncontentions. They in consequence became finally so brutalised, that no\r\nGreek city has ever witnessed a longer series of the most atrocious\r\ncrimes. I will give one instance of the ill fortune of Cynaetha in this\r\nrespect, and of the disapproval of such proceedings on the part of the\r\nArcadians at large. When the Cynaethans, after their great massacre,\r\nsent an embassy to Sparta, every city which the ambassadors entered\r\non their road at once ordered them by a herald to depart; while the\r\nMantineans not only did that, but after their departure regularly\r\npurified their city and territory from the taint of blood, by carrying\r\nvictims round them both.\r\n\r\nI have had three objects in saying thus much on this subject. First,\r\nthat the character of the Arcadians should not suffer from the crimes\r\nof one city: secondly, that other nations should not neglect music,\r\nfrom an idea that certain Arcadians give an excessive and extravagant\r\nattention to it: and, lastly, I speak for the sake of the Cynaethans\r\nthemselves, that, if ever God gives them better fortune, they may\r\nhumanise themselves by turning their attention to education, and\r\nespecially to music.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip V. comes to Corinth. B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advances toward Sparta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Adeimantus assassinated.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ To return from this digression. When the Aetolians had reached\r\ntheir homes in safety after this raid upon the Peloponnese, Philip,\r\ncoming to the aid of the Achaeans with an army, arrived at Corinth.\r\nFinding that he was too late, he sent despatches to all the allies\r\nurging them to send deputies at once to Corinth, to consult on the\r\nmeasures required for the common safety. Meanwhile he himself marched\r\ntowards Tegea, being informed that the Lacedaemonians were in a\r\nstate of revolution, and were fallen to mutual slaughter. For being\r\naccustomed to have a king over them, and to be entirely submissive to\r\ntheir rulers, their sudden enfranchisement by means of Antigonus, and\r\nthe absence of a king, produced a state of civil war; because they all\r\nimagined themselves to be on a footing of complete political equality.\r\nAt first two of the five Ephors kept their views to themselves; while\r\nthe other three threw in their lot with the Aetolians, because they\r\nwere convinced that the youth of Philip would prevent him as yet from\r\nhaving a decisive influence in the Peloponnese. But when, contrary to\r\ntheir expectations, the Aetolians retired quickly from the Peloponnese,\r\nand Philip arrived still more quickly from Macedonia, the three Ephors\r\nbecame distrustful of Adeimantus, one of the other two, because he was\r\nprivy to and disapproved of their plans; and were in a great state of\r\nanxiety lest he should tell Philip everything as soon as that monarch\r\napproached. After some consultation therefore with certain young men,\r\nthey published a proclamation ordering all citizens of military age to\r\nassemble in arms in the sacred enclosure of Athene of the Brazen-house,\r\non the pretext that the Macedonians were advancing against the town.\r\nThis startling announcement caused a rapid muster: when Adeimantus, who\r\ndisapproved of the measure, came forward and endeavoured to show that\r\n“the proclamation and summons to assemble in arms should have been made\r\nsome time before, when they were told that their enemies the Aetolians\r\nwere approaching the frontier: not then, when they learnt that their\r\nbenefactors and preservers the Macedonians were coming with their\r\nking.” In the middle of this dissuasive speech the young men whose\r\nco-operation had been secured struck him dead, and with him Sthenelaus,\r\nAlcamenes, Thyestes, Bionidas, and several other citizens; whereupon\r\nPolyphontes and certain of his party, seeing clearly what was going to\r\nhappen, went off to join Philip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip summons Spartan deputies to Tegea.]\r\n\r\n+23.+ Immediately after the commission of this crime, the Ephors who\r\nwere then in power sent men to Philip, to accuse the victims of this\r\nmassacre; and to beg him to delay his approach, until the affairs of\r\nthe city had returned to their normal state after this commotion;\r\nand to be assured meanwhile that it was their purpose to be loyal\r\nand friendly to the Macedonians in every respect. These ambassadors\r\nfound Philip near Mount Parthenius,[212] and communicated to him their\r\ncommission. Having listened, he bade the ambassadors make all haste\r\nhome, and inform the Ephors that he was going to continue his march to\r\nTegea, and expected that they would as quickly as possible send him\r\nmen of credit to consult with him on the present position of affairs.\r\nAfter hearing this message from the king, the Lacedaemonian officers\r\ndespatched ten commissioners headed by Omias to meet Philip; who, on\r\narriving at Tegea, and entering the king’s council chamber, accused\r\nAdeimantus of being the cause of the late commotion; and promised that\r\nthey would perform all their obligations as allies to Philip, and\r\nshow that they were second to none of those whom he looked upon as\r\nhis most loyal friends, in their affection for his person. With these\r\nand similar asseverations the Lacedaemonian commissioners left the\r\ncouncil chamber. The members of the council were divided in opinion:\r\none party knowing the secret treachery of the Spartan magistrates, and\r\nfeeling certain that Adeimantus had lost his life from his loyalty\r\nto Macedonia, while the Lacedaemonians had really determined upon an\r\nalliance with the Aetolians, advised Philip to make an example of the\r\nLacedaemonians, by treating them precisely as Alexander had treated\r\nthe Thebans, immediately after his assumption of his sovereignty. But\r\nanother party, consisting of the older counsellors, sought to show\r\nthat such severity was too great for the occasion, and that all that\r\nought to be done was to rebuke the offenders, depose them, and put the\r\nmanagement of the state and the chief offices in the hands of his own\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king decides not to chastise Sparta.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ The king gave the final decision, if that decision may be\r\ncalled the king’s: for it is not reasonable to suppose that a mere\r\nboy should be able to come to a decision on matters of such moment.\r\nHistorians, however, must attribute to the highest official present\r\nthe final decisions arrived at: it being thoroughly understood among\r\ntheir readers that propositions and opinions, such as these, in all\r\nprobability proceed from the members of the council, and particularly\r\nfrom those highest in his confidence. In this case the decision of\r\nthe king ought most probably to be attributed to Aratus. It was to\r\nthis effect: the king said that “in the case of injuries inflicted by\r\nthe allies upon each other separately, his intervention ought to be\r\nconfined to a remonstrance by word of mouth or letter; but that it was\r\nonly injuries affecting the whole body of the allies which demanded\r\njoint intervention and redress: and seeing that the Lacedaemonians had\r\nplainly committed no such injury against the whole body of allies,\r\nbut professed their readiness to satisfy every claim that could with\r\njustice be made upon them, he held that he ought not to decree any\r\nmeasure of excessive severity against them. For it would be very\r\ninconsistent for him to take severe measures against them for so\r\ninsignificant a cause; while his father inflicted no punishment at\r\nall upon them, though when he conquered them they were not allies\r\nbut professed enemies.” It having, therefore, been formally decided\r\nto overlook the incident, the king immediately sent Petraeus, one of\r\nhis most trusted friends, with Omias, to exhort the people to remain\r\nfaithful to their friendship with him and Macedonia, and to interchange\r\noaths of alliance; while he himself started once more with his army and\r\nreturned towards Corinth, having in his conduct to the Lacedaemonians\r\ngiven an excellent specimen of his policy towards the allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The congress of allies at Corinth declare war against the\r\nAetolians.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ When he arrived at Corinth he found the envoys from the allied\r\ncities already there; and in consultation with them he discussed the\r\nmeasures to be taken in regard to the Aetolians. The complaints against\r\nthem were stated by the various envoys. The Boeotians accused them\r\nof plundering the temple of Athene at Itone[213] in time of peace:\r\nthe Phocians of having attacked and attempted to seize the cities of\r\nAmbrysus and Daulium: the Epirotes of having committed depredations in\r\ntheir territory. The Acarnanians showed how they had contrived a plot\r\nfor the betrayal of Thyrium into their hands, and had gone so far as to\r\nactually assault it under cover of night. The Achaeans made a statement\r\nshowing that they had seized Clarium in the territory of Megalopolis;\r\ntraversed the territories of Patrae and Pharae, pillaging the country\r\nas they went; completely sacked Cynaetha; plundered the temple of\r\nArtemis in Lusi; laid siege to Cleitor; attempted Pylus by sea, and\r\nMegalopolis by land, doing all they could by aid of the Illyrians to\r\nlay waste the latter after its recent restoration. After listening\r\nto these depositions, the congress of allies unanimously decided to\r\ngo to war with the Aetolians. A decree was, therefore, formulated in\r\nwhich the aforesaid causes for war were stated as a preamble, and a\r\ndeclaration sub-joined of their intention of restoring to the several\r\nallies any portion of their territory seized by the Aetolians since the\r\ndeath of Demetrius, father of Philip; and similarly of restoring to\r\ntheir ancestral forms of government all states that had been compelled\r\nagainst their will to join the Aetolian league; with full possession\r\nof their own territory and cities; subject to no foreign garrison\r\nor tribute; in complete independence; and in enjoyment of their own\r\nconstitutions and laws. Finally a clause in the decree declared their\r\nintention of assisting the Amphictyonic council to restore the laws,\r\nand to recover its control of the Delphic temple, wrested from it by\r\nthe Aetolians, who were determined to keep in their own hands all that\r\nbelonged to that temple.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Autumn, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ This decree was made in the first year of the 140th Olympiad,\r\nand with it began the so-called Social war, the commencement of which\r\nwas thoroughly justifiable and a natural consequence of the injurious\r\nacts of the Aetolians. The first step of the congress was to send\r\ncommissioners at once to the several allies, that the decree having\r\nbeen confirmed by as many as possible, all might join in this national\r\nwar. Philip also sent a declaratory letter to the Aetolians, in order\r\nthat, if they had any justification to put forward on the points\r\nalleged against them, they might even at that late hour meet and settle\r\nthe controversy by conference: “but if they supposed that they were,\r\nwith no public declaration of war, to sack and plunder, without the\r\ninjured parties retaliating, on pain of being considered, if they did\r\nso, to have commenced hostilities, they were the most simple people in\r\nthe world.” On the receipt of this letter the Aetolian magistrates,\r\nthinking that Philip would never come, named a day on which they would\r\nmeet him at Rhium. When they were informed, however, that he had\r\nactually arrived there, they sent a despatch informing him that they\r\nwere not competent, before the meeting of the Aetolian assembly, to\r\nsettle any public matter on their own authority. But when the Achaeans\r\nmet at the usual federal assembly, they ratified the decree, and\r\npublished a proclamation authorising reprisals upon the Aetolians. And\r\nwhen King Philip appeared before the council at Aegium, and informed\r\nthem at length of all that had taken place, they received his speech\r\nwith warmth, and formally renewed with him personally the friendship\r\nwhich had existed between his ancestors and themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scopas elected Aetolian Strategus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 385.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 387.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 382.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ Meanwhile, the time of the annual election having come round, the\r\nAetolians elected Scopas as their Strategus, the man who had been the\r\nmoving spirit in all these acts of violence. I am at a loss for fitting\r\nterms to describe such a public policy. To pass a decree against going\r\nto war,[214] and yet to go on an actual expedition in force and pillage\r\ntheir neighbours' territories: not to punish one of those responsible\r\nfor this: but on the contrary to elect as Strategi and bestow honours\r\non the leaders in these transactions,—this seems to me to involve the\r\ngrossest disingenuousness. I can find no word which better describes\r\nsuch a treacherous policy; and I will quote two instances to show what\r\nI mean by it. When Phoebidas treacherously seized the Cadmeia, the\r\nLacedaemonians fined the guilty general but declined to withdraw the\r\ngarrison, on the ground that the wrong was fully atoned for by the\r\npunishment of the perpetrator of it: though their plain duty was to\r\nhave done the reverse, for it was the latter which was of importance to\r\nthe Thebans. Again this same people published a proclamation giving the\r\nvarious cities freedom and autonomy in accordance with the terms of the\r\npeace of Antalcidas, and yet did not withdraw their Harmosts from the\r\ncities. Again, having driven the Mantineans from their home, who were\r\nat the time their friends and allies, they denied that they were doing\r\nany wrong, inasmuch as they removed them from one city and settled\r\nthem in several. But indeed a man is a fool, as much as a knave, if he\r\nimagines that, because he shuts his own eyes, his neighbours cannot\r\nsee. Their fondness for such tortuous policy proved however, both to\r\nthe Lacedaemonians and Aetolians, the source of the greatest disasters;\r\nand it is not one which should commend itself to the imitation either\r\nof individuals or states, if they are well advised.\r\n\r\nKing Philip, then, after his interview with the Achaean assembly,\r\nstarted with his army on the way to Macedonia, in all haste to make\r\npreparations for war; leaving a pleasant impression in the minds of all\r\nthe Greeks: for the nature of the decree, which I have mentioned as\r\nhaving been passed by him,[215] gave them good hopes of finding him a\r\nman of moderate temper and royal magnanimity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 118.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ These transactions were contemporaneous with Hannibal’s\r\nexpedition against Saguntum, after his conquest of all Iberia south\r\nof the Iber. Now, had the first attempts of Hannibal been from the\r\nbeginning involved with the transactions in Greece, it would have been\r\nplainly my proper course to have narrated the latter side by side with\r\nthose in Iberia in my previous book, with an eye solely to dates.\r\nBut seeing that the wars in Italy, Greece, and Asia were at their\r\ncommencements entirely distinct, and yet became finally involved with\r\neach other, I decided that my history of them must also be distinct,\r\nuntil I came to the point at which they became inseparably interlaced,\r\nand began to tend towards a common conclusion. Thus both will be made\r\nclear,—the account of their several commencements: and the time,\r\nmanner, and causes which led to the complication and amalgamation, of\r\nwhich I spoke in my introduction. This point having been reached, I\r\nmust thenceforth embrace them all in one uninterrupted narrative. This\r\namalgamation began towards the end of the war, in the third year of\r\nthe 140th Olympiad. From that year, therefore, my history will, with a\r\ndue regard to dates, become a general one. Before that year it must be\r\ndivided into distinct narratives, with a mere recapitulation in each\r\ncase of the events detailed in the preceding book, introduced for the\r\nsake of facilitating the comprehension, and rousing the admiration, of\r\nmy readers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip secures the support of Scerdilaidas.]\r\n\r\n+29.+ Philip then passed the winter in Macedonia, in an energetic\r\nenlistment of troops for the coming campaign, and in securing his\r\nfrontier on the side of the Barbarians. And having accomplished these\r\nobjects, he met Scerdilaidas and put himself fearlessly in his power,\r\nand discussed with him the terms of friendship and alliance; and partly\r\nby promising to help him in securing his power in Illyria, and partly\r\nby bringing against the Aetolians the charges to which they were only\r\ntoo open, persuaded him without difficulty to assent to his proposals.\r\nThe fact is that public crimes do not differ from private, except in\r\nquantity and extent; and just as in the case of petty thieves, what\r\nbrings them to ruin more than anything else is that they cheat and are\r\nunfaithful to each other, so was it in the case of the Aetolians. They\r\nhad agreed with Scerdilaidas to give him half the booty, if he would\r\njoin them in their attack upon Achaea; but when, on his consenting\r\nto do so, and actually carrying out his engagement, they had sacked\r\nCynaetha and carried off a large booty in slaves and cattle, they gave\r\nhim no share in the spoil at all. He was therefore already enraged\r\nwith them; and required very little persuasion on Philip’s part to\r\ninduce him to accept the proposal, and agree to join the alliance, on\r\ncondition of receiving a yearly subsidy of twenty talents; and, in\r\nreturn, putting to sea with thirty galleys and carrying on a naval war\r\nwith the Aetolians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Acarnanians, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duplicity of the Epirotes.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ While Philip was thus engaged, the commissioners sent out to the\r\nallies were performing their mission. The first place they came to was\r\nAcarnania; and the Acarnanians, with a noble promptitude, confirmed the\r\ndecree and undertook to join the war against the Aetolians with their\r\nfull forces. And yet they, if any one, might have been excused if they\r\nhad put the matter off, and hesitated, and shown fear of entering upon\r\na war with their neighbours; both because they lived upon the frontiers\r\nof Aetolia, and still more because they were peculiarly open to attack,\r\nand, most of all, because they had a short time before experienced\r\nthe most dreadful disasters from the enmity of the Aetolians. But I\r\nimagine that men of noble nature, whether in private or public affairs,\r\nlook upon duty as the highest consideration; and in adherence to this\r\nprinciple no people in Greece have been more frequently conspicuous\r\nthan the Acarnanians, although the forces at their command were but\r\nslender. With them, above all others in Greece, an alliance should be\r\nsought at a crisis, without any misgiving; for they have, individually\r\nand collectively, an element of stability and a spirit of liberality.\r\nThe conduct of the Epirotes was in strong contrast. When they heard\r\nwhat the commissioners had to say, indeed, they, like the Acarnanians,\r\njoined in confirming the decree, and voted to go to war with the\r\nAetolians at such time as Philip also did the same; but with ignoble\r\nduplicity they told the Aetolian envoys that they had determined to\r\nmaintain peace with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy Philopator.]\r\n\r\nAmbassadors were despatched also to King Ptolemy, to urge him not to\r\nsend money to the Aetolians, nor to supply them with any aid against\r\nPhilip and the allies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Timidity of the Messenians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 480-479. Pindar fr.]\r\n\r\n+31.+ The Messenians again, on whose account the war began, answered\r\nthe commissioners sent to them that, seeing Phigalia was on their\r\nfrontier and was in the power of the Aetolians, they would not\r\nundertake the war until that city was wrested from them. This decision\r\nwas forcibly carried, much against the will of the people at large,\r\nby the Ephors Oenis and Nicippus, and some others of the oligarchical\r\nparty: wherein they showed, to my thinking, great ignorance of their\r\ntrue interests. I admit, indeed, that war is a terrible thing; but it\r\nis less terrible than to submit to anything whatever in order to avoid\r\nit. For what is the meaning of our fine talk about equality of rights,\r\nfreedom of speech, and liberty, if the one important thing is peace? We\r\nhave no good word for the Thebans, because they shrunk from fighting\r\nfor Greece and chose from fear to side with the Persians,—nor indeed\r\nfor Pindar who supported their inaction in the verses—[216]\r\n\r\n   A quiet haven for the ship of state\r\n     Should be the patriot’s aim,\r\n   And smiling peace, to small and great\r\n     That brings no shame.\r\n\r\nFor though his advice was for the moment acceptable, it was not long\r\nbefore it became manifest that his opinion was as mischievous as it was\r\ndishonourable. For peace, with justice and honour, is the noblest and\r\nmost advantageous thing in the world; when joined with disgrace and\r\ncontemptible cowardice, it is the basest and most disastrous.[217]\r\n\r\n+32.+ The Messenian leaders, then, being of oligarchical tendencies,\r\nand aiming at their own immediate advantage, were always too much\r\ninclined to peace. On many critical occasions indeed they managed to\r\nelude fear and danger: but all the while this policy of theirs was\r\naccumulating a heavy retribution for themselves; and they finally\r\ninvolved their country in the gravest misfortunes. And the reason in\r\nmy opinion was this, that being neighbours to two of the most powerful\r\nnations in the Peloponnese, or I might almost say in Greece, I mean\r\nthe Arcadians and Lacedaemonians,—one of which had been irreconcilably\r\nhostile to them from the moment they occupied the country, and the\r\nother disposed to be friendly and protect them,—they never frankly\r\naccepted hostility to the Spartans, or friendship with the Arcadians.\r\nAccordingly when the attention of the former was distracted by domestic\r\nor foreign war, the Messenians were secure; for they always enjoyed\r\npeace and tranquillity from the fact of their country lying out of\r\nthe road: but when the Lacedaemonians, having nothing else on hand to\r\ndistract their attention, took to inflicting injuries on them, they\r\nwere unable to withstand the superior strength of the Lacedaemonians\r\nby their own power; and, having failed to secure the support of their\r\ntrue friends, who were ready to do anything for their protection, they\r\nwere reduced to the alternatives of becoming the slaves of Sparta and\r\nenduring her heavy exactions; or of leaving their homes to escape from\r\nthis servitude, abandoning their country with wives and children. And\r\nthis has repeatedly happened to them within comparatively recent times.\r\n\r\nThat the present settlement of the Peloponnese may prove a lasting\r\none, so that no measure such as I am about to describe may be ever\r\nnecessary, is indeed my earnest wish: but if anything does happen\r\nto disturb it, and threaten revolutionary changes, the only hope\r\nfor the Messenians and Megalopolitans of continuing to occupy their\r\npresent territory, that I can see, is a recurrence to the policy of\r\nEpaminondas. They must resolve, that is to say, upon a cordial and\r\nsincere partnership with each other in every danger and labour.\r\n\r\n+33.+ And perhaps my observation may receive some support from\r\nancient history. For, among many other indications, it is a fact\r\nthat the Messenians did set up a pillar close to the altar of Zeus\r\nLycaeus in the time of Aristomenes,[218] according to the evidence of\r\nCallisthenes, in which they inscribed the following verses:\r\n\r\n   A faithless king will perish soon or late!\r\n     Messene tracked him down right easily,\r\n   The traitor:—perjury must meet its fate;\r\n     Glory to Zeus, and life to Arcady!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 362.]\r\n\r\nThe point of this is, that, having lost their own country, they pray\r\nthe gods to save Arcadia as their second country.[219] And it was\r\nvery natural that they should do so; for not only did the Arcadians\r\nreceive them when driven from their own land, at the time of the\r\nAristomenic war, and make them welcome to their homes and free of their\r\ncivic rights; but they also passed a vote bestowing their daughters\r\nin marriage upon those of the Messenians who were of proper age; and\r\nbesides all this, investigated the treason of their king Aristocrates\r\nin the battle of the Trench; and, finding him guilty, put him to death\r\nand utterly destroyed his whole family. But setting aside these ancient\r\nevents, what has happened recently after the restoration of Megalopolis\r\nand Messene will be sufficient to support what I have said. For when,\r\nupon the death of Epaminondas leaving the result of the battle of\r\nMantinea doubtful, the Lacedaemonians endeavoured to prevent the\r\nMessenians from being included in the truce, hoping even then to get\r\nMessenia into their own hands, the Megalopolitans, and all the other\r\nArcadians who were allied with the Messenians, made such a point of\r\ntheir being admitted to the benefits of the new confederacy, that they\r\nwere accepted by the allies and allowed to take the oaths and share in\r\nthe provisions of the peace; while the Lacedaemonians were the only\r\nGreeks excluded from the treaty. With such facts before him, could any\r\none doubt the soundness of the suggestion I lately made?\r\n\r\nI have said thus much for the sake of the Arcadians and Messenians\r\nthemselves; that, remembering all the misfortunes which have befallen\r\ntheir countries at the hands of the Lacedaemonians, they may cling\r\nclose to the policy of mutual affection and fidelity; and let no fear\r\nof war, or desire of peace, induce them to abandon each other in what\r\naffects the highest interests of both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Division of opinion in Sparta, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ In the matter of the commissioners from the allies, to go back to\r\nmy story, the behaviour of the Lacedaemonians was very characteristic.\r\nFor their own ill-considered and tortuous policy had placed them in\r\nsuch a difficulty, that they finally dismissed them without an answer:\r\nthus illustrating, as it seems to me, the truth of the saying, that,\r\n“boldness pushed to extremes amounts to want of sense, and comes to\r\nnothing.” Subsequently, however, on the appointment of new Ephors, the\r\nparty who had originally promoted the outbreak, and had been the causes\r\nof the massacre, sent to the Aetolians to induce them to despatch an\r\nambassador to Sparta. The Aetolians gladly consented, and in a short\r\ntime Machatas arrived there in that capacity. Pressure was at once\r\nput upon the Ephors to allow Machatas to address the people,[220] and\r\nto re-establish royalty in accordance with the ancient constitution,\r\nand not to allow the Heraclid dynasty to be any longer suppressed,\r\ncontrary to the laws. The Ephors were annoyed at the proposal, but\r\nwere unable to withstand the pressure, and afraid of a rising of the\r\nyounger men: they therefore answered that the question of restoring the\r\nkings must be reserved for future consideration; but they consented to\r\ngrant Machatas an opportunity of addressing a public assembly. When\r\nthe people accordingly were met, Machatas came forward, and in a long\r\nspeech urged them to embrace the alliance with Aetolia; inveighing in\r\nreckless and audacious terms against the Macedonians, while he went\r\nbeyond all reason and truth in his commendations of the Aetolians. Upon\r\nhis retirement, there was a long and animated debate between those who\r\nsupported the Aetolians and advised the adoption of their alliance, and\r\nthose who took the opposite side. When, however, some of the elders\r\nreminded the people of the good services rendered them by Antigonus\r\nand the Macedonians, and the injuries inflicted on them by Charixenus\r\nand Timaeus,—when the Aetolians invaded them with their full force\r\nand ravaged their territory, enslaved the neighbouring villages, and\r\nlaid a plot for attacking Sparta itself by a fraudulent and forcible\r\nrestoration of exiles,—these words produced a great revulsion of\r\nfeeling, and the people finally decided to maintain the alliance with\r\nPhilip and the Macedonians. Machatas accordingly had to go home without\r\nattaining the object of his mission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of the Ephors, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agesipolis appointed king,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 242.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ The party, however, at Sparta who were the original of the\r\ninstigators of the outbreak could not make up their minds to give way.\r\nThey once more therefore determined to commit a crime of the most\r\nimpious description, having first corrupted some of the younger men.\r\nIt was an ancestral custom that, at a certain sacrifice, all citizens\r\nof military age should join fully armed in a procession to the temple\r\nof Athene of the Brazen-house, while the Ephors remained in the sacred\r\nprecinct and completed the sacrifice. As the young men therefore were\r\nconducting the procession, some of them suddenly fell upon the Ephors,\r\nwhile they were engaged with the sacrifice, and slew them. The enormity\r\nof this crime will be made apparent by remembering that the sanctity\r\nof this temple was such, that it gave a safe asylum even to criminals\r\ncondemned to death; whereas its privileges were now by the cruelty of\r\nthese audacious men treated with such contempt, that the whole of the\r\nEphors were butchered round the altar and the table of the goddess. In\r\npursuance of their purpose they next killed one of the elders, Gyridas,\r\nand drove into exile those who had spoken against the Aetolians. They\r\nthen chose some of their own body as Ephors, and made an alliance\r\nwith the Aetolians. Their motives for doing all this, for incurring\r\nthe enmity of the Achaeans, for their ingratitude to the Macedonians,\r\nand generally for their unjustifiable conduct towards all, was before\r\neverything else their devotion to Cleomenes, and the hopes and\r\nexpectations they continued to cherish that he would return to Sparta\r\nin safety. So true it is that men who have the tact to ingratiate\r\nthemselves with those who surround them can, even when far removed,\r\nleave in their hearts very effective materials for kindling the flame\r\nof a renewed popularity. This people for instance, to say nothing of\r\nother examples, after nearly three years of constitutional government,\r\nfollowing the banishment of Cleomenes, without once thinking of\r\nappointing kings at Sparta, no sooner heard of the death of Cleomenes\r\nthan they were eager—populace and Ephors alike—to restore kingly rule.\r\nAccordingly the Ephors who were in sympathy with the conspirators, and\r\nwho had made the alliance with Aetolia which I just now mentioned, did\r\nso. One of these kings so restored they appointed in accordance with\r\nthe regular and legal succession, namely Agesipolis. He was a child\r\nat the time, a son of Agesipolis, and grandson of that Cleombrotus\r\nwho had become king, as the next of kin to this family, when Leonidas\r\nwas driven from office. As guardian of the young king they elected\r\nCleomenes, son of Cleombrotus and brother of Agesipolis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Lycurgas.]\r\n\r\nOf the other royal house there were surviving two sons of Archidamus,\r\nson of Eudamidas, by the daughter of Hippodemon; as well as Hippodemon\r\nhimself, the son of Agesilaus, and several other members of the same\r\nbranch, though somewhat less closely connected than those I have\r\nmentioned. But these were all passed over, and Lycurgus was appointed\r\nking, none of whose ancestors had ever enjoyed that title. A present\r\nof a talent to each of the Ephors made him “descendant of Hercules”\r\nand king of Sparta. So true is it all the world over that such\r\nnobility[221] is a mere question of a little money.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the penalty for their folly had to be paid, not\r\nby the third generation, but by the very authors of this royalist\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spartans attack Argos, and proclaim war with the Achaeans.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ When Machatas heard what had happened at Sparta, he returned\r\nthither and urged the Ephors and kings to go to war with the Achaeans;\r\n\r\narguing that that was the only way of stopping the ambition of the\r\nparty in Sparta who were doing all they could to break up the alliance\r\nwith the Aetolians, or of the party in Aetolia who were co-operating\r\nwith them. Having obtained the consent of the Ephors and kings,\r\nMachatas returned home with a success secured him by the blindness\r\nof his partisans in Sparta; while Lycurgus with the army and certain\r\nothers of the citizens invaded the Argive territory, the inhabitants\r\nbeing quite unprepared for an attack, owing to the existing settlement.\r\nBy a sudden assault he seized Polichna, Prasiae, Leucae, and Cyphanta,\r\nbut was repulsed at Glympes and Zarax. After these achievements of\r\ntheir king, the Lacedaemonians proclaimed a licence of reprisal\r\nagainst the Achaeans. With the Eleans also Machatas was successful in\r\npersuading them, by the same arguments as he had used at Sparta, to go\r\nto war with the Achaeans.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected success of these intrigues caused the Aetolians to enter\r\nupon the war with high spirits. But it was quite the contrary with the\r\nAchaeans: for Philip, on whom their hopes rested, was still busy with\r\nhis preparations; the Epirotes were hesitating about going to war, and\r\nthe Messenians were entirely passive; and meantime the Aetolians, aided\r\nby the blind policy of the Eleans and Lacedaemonians, were threatening\r\nthem with actual war on every side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus succeeded by his son as Strategus of the Achaeans,\r\nMay B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: June-September. B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ The year of Aratus’s office was just expiring, and his son Aratus\r\nthe younger had been elected to succeed him as Strategus, and was on\r\nthe point of taking over the office. Scopas was still Strategus of\r\nthe Aetolians, and in fact it was just about the middle of his year.\r\nFor the Aetolians hold their elections immediately after the autumn\r\nequinox, while the Achaeans hold theirs about the time of the rising of\r\nthe Pleiads. As soon therefore as summer had well set in, and Aratus\r\nthe younger had taken over his office, all these wars at once began\r\nsimultaneously. Hannibal began besieging Saguntum; the Romans sent\r\nLucius Aemilius with an army to Illyria against Demetrius of Pharos,—of\r\nboth which I spoke in the last book; Antiochus, having had Ptolemais\r\nand Tyre betrayed to him by Theodotus, meditated attacking Coele-Syria;\r\nand Ptolemy was engaged in preparing for the war with Antiochus. While\r\nLycurgus, wishing to make a beginning after the pattern of Cleomenes,\r\npitched his camp near the Athenaeum of Megalopolis and was laying\r\nsiege to it: the Achaeans were collecting mercenary horse and foot for\r\nthe war which was upon them: and Philip, finally, was starting from\r\nMacedonia with an army consisting of ten thousand heavy-armed soldiers\r\nof the phalanx, five thousand light-armed, and eight hundred cavalry.\r\nSuch was the universal state of war or preparation for war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rhodian and Byzantium war, 220-219 B.C.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ At the same time the Rhodians went to war with the Byzantines,\r\nfor reasons which I must now describe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of the situation of Byzantium.]\r\n\r\nAs far as the sea is concerned, Byzantium occupies a position the\r\nmost secure and in every way the most advantageous of any town in our\r\nquarter of the world: while in regard to the land, its situation is in\r\nboth respects the most unfavourable. By sea it so completely commands\r\nthe entrance to the Pontus, that no merchant can sail in or out against\r\nits will. The Pontus therefore being rich in what the rest of the\r\nworld requires for the support of life, the Byzantines are absolute\r\nmasters of all such things. For those commodities which are the first\r\nnecessaries of existence, cattle and slaves, are confessedly supplied\r\nby the districts round the Pontus in greater profusion, and of better\r\nquality, than by any others: and for luxuries, they supply us with\r\nhoney, wax, and salt-fish in great abundance; while they take our\r\nsuperfluous stock of olive oil and every kind of wine. In the matter\r\nof corn there is a mutual interchange, they supplying or taking it as\r\nit happens to be convenient. Now the Greeks would necessarily have\r\nbeen excluded entirely from traffic in these articles, or at least\r\nwould have had to carry it on at a loss, if the Byzantines had adopted\r\na hostile attitude, and made common cause formerly with the Gauls, or\r\nstill more at this time with the Thracians, or had abandoned the place\r\naltogether: for owing to the narrowness of the strait, and the number\r\nof the barbarians along its shores, it would have become entirely\r\nimpassable to our ships. The Byzantines themselves probably feel the\r\nadvantages of the situation, in the supplies of the necessaries of\r\nlife, more than any one else; for their superfluity finds a ready\r\nmeans of export, and what they lack is readily imported, with profit\r\nto themselves, and without difficulty or danger: but other people too,\r\nas I have said, get a great many commodities by their means. As common\r\nbenefactors therefore of all Greece they might justly expect, not only\r\ngratitude, but the united assistance of Greeks, when threatened by the\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nBut since the peculiar natural advantages of this site are generally\r\nunknown, because it lies somewhat outside the parts of the world\r\nordinarily visited; and since it is an universal wish to be acquainted\r\nwith things of this sort, by ocular inspection, if possible, of such\r\nplaces as have any unusual or remarkable features; or, if that is\r\nimpossible, by having in our minds some ideas or images of them as like\r\nthe truth as may be, I must now state the facts of the case, and what\r\nit is that makes this city so eminently rich and prosperous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pontus.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ The sea called “The Pontus” has a circumference of twenty-two\r\nthousand stades, and two mouths diametrically opposite to each other,\r\nthe one opening into the Propontis and the other into the Maeotic Lake;\r\nwhich latter also has itself a circumference of eight thousand stades.\r\nInto these two basins many great rivers discharge themselves on the\r\nAsiatic side, and still larger and more numerous on the European; and\r\nso the Maeotic lake, as it gets filled up, flows into the Pontus, and\r\nthe Pontus into the Propontis. The mouth of the Maeotic lake is called\r\nthe Cimmerian Bosporus, about thirty stades broad and sixty long, and\r\nshallow all over; that of the Pontus is called the Thracian Bosporus,\r\nand is a hundred and twenty stades long, and of a varying breadth.\r\nBetween Calchedon and Byzantium the channel is fourteen stades broad,\r\nand this is the entrance at the end nearest the Propontis. Coming from\r\nthe Pontus, it begins at a place called Hieron, at which they say\r\nthat Jason on his return voyage from Colchis first sacrificed to the\r\ntwelve gods. This place is on the Asiatic side, and its distance from\r\nthe European coast is twelve stades, measuring to Sarapieium, which\r\nlies exactly opposite in Thrace. There are two causes which account\r\nfor the fact that the waters, both of the Maeotic lake and the Pontus,\r\ncontinually flow outwards. One is patent at once to every observer,\r\nnamely, that by the continual discharge of many streams into basins\r\nwhich are of definite circumference and content, the water necessarily\r\nis continually increasing in bulk, and, had there been no outlet,\r\nwould inevitably have encroached more and more, and occupied an ever\r\nenlarging area in the depression: but as outlets do exist, the surplus\r\nwater is carried off by a natural process, and runs perpetually through\r\nthe channels that are there to receive it. The second cause is the\r\nalluvial soil brought down, in immense quantities of every description,\r\nby the rivers swollen from heavy rains, which forms shelving banks and\r\ncontinually forces the water to take a higher level, which is thus also\r\ncarried through these outlets. Now as this process of alluvial deposit\r\nand influx of water is unceasing and continuous, so also the discharge\r\nthrough the channels is necessarily unceasing and continuous.\r\n\r\nThese are the true causes of the outflow of the Pontus, which do\r\nnot depend for their credit on the stories of merchants, but upon\r\nthe actual observation of nature, which is the most accurate method\r\ndiscoverable.\r\n\r\n+40.+ As I have started this topic I must not, as most historians do,\r\nleave any point undiscussed, or only barely stated. My object is rather\r\nto give information, and to clear up doubtful points for my readers.\r\nThis is the peculiarity of the present day, in which every sea and land\r\nhas been thrown open to travellers; and in which, therefore, one can no\r\nlonger employ the evidence of poets and fabulists, as my predecessors\r\nhave done on very many points, “offering,” as Heraclitus says, “tainted\r\nwitnesses to disputed facts,”—but I must try to make my narrative in\r\nitself carry conviction to my readers.\r\n\r\nI say then the Pontus has long been in process of being filled up with\r\nmud, and that this process is actually going on now: and further, that\r\nin process of time both it and the Propontis, assuming the same local\r\nconditions to be maintained, and the causes of the alluvial deposit to\r\ncontinue active, will be entirely filled up. For time being infinite,\r\nand the depressions most undoubtedly finite, it is plain that, even\r\nthough the amount of deposit be small, they must in course of time\r\nbe filled. For a finite process, whether of accretion or decrease,\r\nmust, if we presuppose infinite time, be eventually completed, however\r\ninfinitesimal its progressive stages may be. In the present instance\r\nthe amount of soil deposited being not small, but exceedingly large,\r\nit is plain that the result I mentioned will not be remote but rapid.\r\nAnd, in fact, it is evident that it is already taking place. The\r\nMaeotic lake is already so much choked up, that the greater part of it\r\nis only from seven to five fathoms deep, and accordingly cannot any\r\nlonger be passed by large ships without a pilot. And having moreover\r\nbeen originally a sea precisely on a level with the Pontus, it is now a\r\nfreshwater lake: the sea-water has been expelled by the silting up of\r\nthe bottom, and the discharge of the rivers has entirely overpowered\r\nit. The same will happen to the Pontus, and indeed is taking place at\r\nthis moment; and though it is not evident to ordinary observers, owing\r\nto the vastness of its basin, yet a moderately attentive study will\r\ndiscover even now what is going on.\r\n\r\n+41.+ For the Danube discharging itself into the Pontus by several\r\nmouths, we find opposite it a bank formed by the mud discharged from\r\nthese mouths extending for nearly a thousand stades, at a distance of\r\na day’s sail from the shore as it now exists; upon which ships sailing\r\nto the Pontus run, while apparently still in deep water, and find\r\nthemselves unexpectedly stranded on the sandbanks which the sailors\r\ncall the Breasts. That this deposit is not close to the shore, but\r\nprojected to some distance, must be accounted for thus: exactly as far\r\nas the currents of the rivers retain their force from the strength of\r\nthe descending stream, and overpower that of the sea, it must of course\r\nfollow that to that distance the earth, and whatever else is carried\r\ndown by the rivers, would be projected, and neither settle nor become\r\nfixed until it is reached. But when the force of the currents has\r\nbecome quite spent by the depth and bulk of the sea, it is but natural\r\nthat the soil held in solution should settle down and assume a fixed\r\nposition. This is the explanation of the fact, that, in the case of\r\nlarge and rapid rivers, such embankments are at considerable distances,\r\nand the sea close in shore deep; while in the case of smaller and more\r\nsluggish streams, these sandbanks are at their mouths. The strongest\r\nproof of this is furnished by the case of heavy rains; for when they\r\noccur, rivers of inferior size, overpowering the waves at their mouths,\r\nproject the alluvial deposit out to sea, to a distance exactly in\r\nproportion to the force of the streams thus discharging themselves.\r\nIt would be mere foolish scepticism to disbelieve in the enormous\r\nsize of this sandbank, and in the mass of stones, timber, and earth\r\ncarried down by the rivers; when we often see with our own eyes an\r\ninsignificant stream suddenly swell into a torrent, and force its way\r\nover lofty rocks, sweeping along with it every kind of timber, soil,\r\nand stones, and making such huge moraines, that at times the appearance\r\nof a locality becomes in a brief period difficult to recognise.[222]\r\n\r\n+42.+ This should prevent any surprise that rivers of such magnitude\r\nand rapidity, flowing perpetually instead of intermittently, should\r\nproduce these effects and end by filling up the Pontus. For it is not\r\na mere probability, but a logical certainty, that this must happen.\r\nAnd a proof of what is going to take place is this, that in the same\r\nproportion as the Maeotic lake is less salt than the Pontus, the\r\nPontus is less so than the Mediterranean. From which it is manifest\r\nthat, when the time which it has taken for the Maeotic lake to fill\r\nup shall have been extended in proportion to the excess of the Pontic\r\nover the Maeotic basin, then the Pontus will also become like a marsh\r\nand lake, and filled with fresh water like the Maeotic lake: nay, we\r\nmust suppose that the process will be somewhat more rapid, insomuch\r\nas the rivers falling into it are more numerous and more rapid. I\r\nhave said thus much in answer to the incredulity of those who cannot\r\nbelieve that the Pontus is actually being silted up, and will some day\r\nbe filled; and that so vast a sea will ever become a lake or marsh.\r\nBut I have another and higher object also in thus speaking: which is\r\nto prevent our ignorance from forcing us to give a childish credence\r\nto every traveller’s tale and marvel related by voyagers; and that,\r\nby possessing certain indications of the truth, we may be enabled by\r\nthem to test the truth or falsehood of anything alleged by this or that\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Site of Byzantium.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 512.]\r\n\r\n+43.+ I must now return to the discussion of the excellence of the\r\nsite of Byzantium. The length of the channel connecting the Pontus\r\nand Propontis being, as I have said, a hundred and twenty stades, and\r\nHieron marking its termination towards the Pontus, and the Strait\r\nof Byzantium that towards the Propontis,—half-way between these, on\r\nthe European side, stands Hermaeum, on a headland jutting out into\r\nthe channel, about five stades from the Asiatic coast, just at the\r\nnarrowest point of the whole channel; where Darius is said to have\r\nmade his bridge of ships across the strait, when he crossed to invade\r\nScythia. In the rest of the channel the running of the current from the\r\nPontus is much the same, owing to the similarity of the coast formation\r\non either side of it; but when it reaches Hermaeum on the European\r\nside, which I said was the narrowest point, the stream flowing from the\r\nPontus, and being thus confined, strikes the European coast with great\r\nviolence, and then, as though by a rebound from a blow, dashes against\r\nthe opposite Asiatic coast, and thence again sweeps back and strikes\r\nthe European shore near some headlands called the Hearths: thence it\r\nruns rapidly once more to the spot on the Asiatic side called the Cow,\r\nthe place on which the myth declares Io to have first stood after\r\nswimming the channel. Finally the current runs from the Cow right up to\r\nByzantium, and dividing into two streams on either side of the city,\r\nthe lesser part of it forms the gulf called the Horn, while the greater\r\npart swerves once more across. But it has no longer sufficient way on\r\nit to reach the opposite shore on which Calchedon stands: for after\r\nits several counter-blows the current, finding at this point a wider\r\nchannel, slackens; and no longer makes short rebounds at right angles\r\nfrom one shore to the other, but more and more at an obtuse angle, and\r\naccordingly, falling short of Calchedon, runs down the middle of the\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 410.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ What then makes Byzantium a most excellent site, and Calchedon\r\nthe reverse, is just this: and although at first sight both positions\r\nseem equally convenient, the practical fact is that it is difficult to\r\nsail up to the latter, even if you wish to do so; while the current\r\ncarries you to the former, whether you will or no, as I have just\r\nnow shown. And a proof of my assertion is this: those who want to\r\ncross from Calchedon to Byzantium cannot sail straight across the\r\nchannel, but coast up to the Cow and Chrysopolis,—which the Athenians\r\nformerly seized, by the advice of Alcibiades, when they for the first\r\ntime levied customs on ships sailing into the Pontus,[223]—and then\r\ndrift down the current, which carries them as a matter of course to\r\nByzantium. And the same is the case with a voyage on either side\r\nof Byzantium. For if a man is running before a south wind from the\r\nHellespont, or to the Hellespont from the Pontus before the Etesian\r\nwinds, if he keeps to the European shore, he has a direct and easy\r\ncourse to the narrow part of the Hellespont between Abydos and Sestos,\r\nand thence also back again to Byzantium: but if he goes from Calchedon\r\nalong the Asiatic coast, the case is exactly the reverse, from the fact\r\nthat the coast is broken up by deep bays, and that the territory of\r\nCyzicus projects to a considerable distance. Nor can a man coming from\r\nthe Hellespont to Calchedon obviate this by keeping to the European\r\ncoast as far as Byzantium, and then striking across to Calchedon;\r\nfor the current and other circumstances which I have mentioned make\r\nit difficult. Similarly, for one sailing out from Calchedon it is\r\nabsolutely impossible to make straight for Thrace, owing to the\r\nintervening current, and to the fact that both winds are unfavourable\r\nto both voyages; for as the south wind blows into the Pontus, and the\r\nnorth wind from it, the one or the other of these must be encountered\r\nin both these voyages. These, then, are the advantages enjoyed by\r\nByzantium in regard to the sea: I must now describe its disadvantages\r\non shore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disadvantages of Byzantium.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ They consist in the fact that its territory is so completely\r\nhemmed in by Thrace from shore to shore, that the Byzantines have a\r\nperpetual and dangerous war continually on hand with the Thracians. For\r\nthey are unable once for all to arm and repel them by a single decisive\r\nbattle, owing to the number of their people and chiefs. For if they\r\nconquer one chief, three others still more formidable invade their\r\nterritory. Nor again do they gain anything by consenting to pay tribute\r\nand make terms; for a concession of any sort to one brings at once five\r\ntimes as many enemies upon them. Therefore, as I say, they are burdened\r\nby a perpetual and dangerous war: for what can be more hazardous or\r\nmore formidable than a war with barbarians living on your borders? Nay,\r\nit is not only this perpetual struggle with danger on land, but, apart\r\nfrom the evils that always accompany war, they have to endure a misery\r\nlike that ascribed by the poets to Tantalus: for being in possession\r\nof an extremely fertile district, no sooner have they expended their\r\nlabour upon it and been rewarded by crops of the finest quality, than\r\nthe barbarians sweep down, and either destroy them, or collect and\r\ncarry them off; and then, to say nothing of the loss of their labour\r\nand expense, the very excellence of the crops enhances the misery and\r\ndistress of seeing them destroyed before their eyes. Still, habit\r\nmaking them able to endure the war with the Thracians, they maintained\r\ntheir original connexions with the other Greeks; but when to their\r\nother misfortunes was added the attack of the Gauls under Comontorius,\r\nthey were reduced to a sad state of distress indeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gauls, B.C. 279.]\r\n\r\n+46.+ These Gauls had left their country with Brennus, and having\r\nsurvived the battle at Delphi and made their way to the Hellespont,\r\ninstead of crossing to Asia, were captivated by the beauty of the\r\ndistrict round Byzantium, and settled there. Then, having conquered\r\nthe Thracians and erected Tyle[224] into a capital, they placed the\r\nByzantines in extreme danger. In their earlier attacks, made under the\r\ncommand of Comontorius their first king, the Byzantines always bought\r\nthem off by presents amounting to three, or five, or sometimes even\r\nten thousand gold pieces, on condition of their not devastating their\r\nterritory: and at last were compelled to agree to pay them a yearly\r\ntribute of eighty talents, until the time of Cavarus, in whose reign\r\ntheir kingdom came to an end; and their whole tribe, being in their\r\nturn conquered by the Thracians, were entirely annihilated. It was in\r\nthese times, then, that being hard pressed by the payment of these\r\nexactions, the Byzantines first sent embassies to the Greek states with\r\na prayer for aid and support in their dangerous situation: but being\r\ndisregarded by the greater number, they, under pressure of necessity,\r\nattempted to levy dues upon ships sailing into the Pontus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Byzantines levy a toll.]\r\n\r\n+47.+ Now this exaction by the Byzantines of a duty upon goods brought\r\nfrom the Pontus, being a heavy loss and burden to everybody, was\r\nuniversally regarded as a grievance; and accordingly an appeal from all\r\nthose engaged in the trade was made to the Rhodians, as acknowledged\r\nmasters of the sea: and it was from this circumstance that the war\r\noriginated of which I am about to speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rhodians declare war, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\nFor the Rhodians, roused to action by the loss incurred by themselves,\r\nas well as that of their neighbours, at first joined their allies in\r\nan embassy to Byzantium, and demanded the abolition of the impost. The\r\nByzantines refused compliance, being persuaded that they were in the\r\nright by the arguments advanced by their chief magistrates, Hecatorus\r\nand Olympidorus, in their interview with the ambassadors. The Rhodian\r\nenvoys accordingly departed without effecting their object. But upon\r\ntheir return home, war was at once voted against Byzantium on these\r\ngrounds; and messengers were immediately despatched to Prusias inviting\r\nhis co-operation in the war: for they knew that Prusias was from\r\nvarious causes incensed with the Byzantines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaeus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 226.]\r\n\r\n+48.+ The Byzantines took steps of a similar nature, by sending to\r\nAttalus and Achaeus begging for their assistance. For his part Attalus\r\nwas ready enough to give it: but his importance was small, because\r\nhe had been reduced within the limits of his ancestral dominions by\r\nAchaeus. But Achaeus who exercised dominion throughout Asia on this\r\nside Taurus, and had recently established his regal power, promised\r\nassistance; and his attitude roused high hopes in the minds of the\r\nByzantines, and corresponding depression in those of the Rhodians and\r\nPrusias. Achaeus was a relation of the Antiochus who had just succeeded\r\nto the kingdom of Syria; and he became possessed of the dominion I\r\nhave mentioned through the following circumstances. After the death of\r\nSeleucus, father of the above-named Antiochus, and the succession of\r\nhis eldest son Seleucus to the throne, Achaeus accompanied the latter\r\nin an expedition over Mount Taurus, about two years before the period\r\nof which we are speaking.[225] For as soon as Seleucus the younger had\r\nsucceeded to the kingdom he learnt that Attalus had already reduced\r\nall Asia on this side of Taurus under his power; and being accordingly\r\neager to support his own rights, he crossed Taurus with a large army.\r\nThere he was treacherously assassinated by Apaturius the Gaul, and\r\nNicanor. Achaeus, in right of his relationship, promptly revenged his\r\nmurder by killing Nicanor and Apaturius; and taking supreme command of\r\nthe army and administration, conducted it with wisdom and integrity.\r\nFor the opportunity was a convenient one, and the feeling of the common\r\nsoldiers was all in favour of his assuming the crown; yet he refused to\r\ndo so, and preserving the royal title for Antiochus the younger, son of\r\nSeleucus, went on energetically with the expedition, and the recovery\r\nof the whole of the territory this side Taurus. Meeting however with\r\nunexpected success,—for he shut up Attalus within the walls of Pergamus\r\nand became master of all the rest of the country,—he was puffed up by\r\nhis good fortune, and at once swerved from his straightforward course\r\nof policy. He assumed the diadem, adopted the title of king, and was at\r\nthis time the most powerful and formidable of all the kings and princes\r\nthis side Taurus. This was the man on whose help the Byzantines relied\r\nwhen they undertook the war against the Rhodians and Prusias.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prusias.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ As to the provocations given before this to Prusias by the\r\nByzantines they were various. In the first place he complained that,\r\nhaving voted to put up certain statues of him, they had not done so,\r\nbut had delayed or forgotten it. In the second place he was annoyed\r\nwith them for taking great pains to compose the hostility, and put an\r\nend to the war, between Achaeus and Attalus; because he looked upon a\r\nfriendship between these two as in many ways detrimental to his own\r\ninterests. He was provoked also because it appeared that when Attalus\r\nwas keeping the festival of Athene, the Byzantines had sent a mission\r\nto join in the celebration; but had sent no one to him when he was\r\ncelebrating the Soteria. Nursing therefore a secret resentment for\r\nthese various offences, he gladly snatched at the pretext offered him\r\nby the Rhodians; and arranged with their ambassadors that they were to\r\ncarry on the war by sea, while he would undertake to inflict no less\r\ndamage on the enemy by land.\r\n\r\nSuch were the causes and origin of the war between Rhodes and Byzantium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hostilities commence, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+50.+ At first the Byzantines entered upon the war with energy, in full\r\nconfidence of receiving the assistance of Achaeus; and of being able\r\nto cause Prusias as much alarm and danger by fetching Tiboetes from\r\nMacedonia as he had done to them. For Prusias, entering upon the war\r\nwith all the animosity which I have described, had seized the place\r\ncalled Hieron at the entrance of the channel, which the Byzantines not\r\nlong before had purchased for a considerable sum of money, because of\r\nits convenient situation; and because they did not wish to leave in\r\nany one else’s hands a point of vantage to be used against merchants\r\nsailing into the Pontus, or one which commanded the slave trade, or the\r\nfishing. Besides this, Prusias had seized in Asia a district of Mysia,\r\nwhich had been in the possession of Byzantium for many years past.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Rhodians manned six ships and received four from their\r\nallies; and, having elected Xenophantus to command them, they sailed\r\nwith this squadron of ten ships to the Hellespont. Nine of them dropped\r\nanchor near Sestos, and stopped ships sailing into the Pontus; with\r\nthe tenth the admiral sailed to Byzantium, to test the spirit of the\r\npeople, and see whether they were already sufficiently alarmed to\r\nchange their minds about the war. Finding them resolved not to listen\r\nhe sailed away, and, taking up his other nine ships, returned to Rhodes\r\nwith the whole squadron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Byzantines sent a message to Achaeus asking for aid, and\r\nan escort to conduct Tiboetes from Macedonia. For it was believed that\r\nTiboetes had as good a claim to the kingdom of Bithynia as Prusias, who\r\nwas his nephew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rhodians secure the friendship of Achaeus.]\r\n\r\n+51.+ But seeing the confident spirit of the Byzantines, the Rhodians\r\nadopted an exceedingly able plan to obtain their object. They perceived\r\nthat the resolution of the Byzantines in venturing on the war rested\r\nmainly on their hopes of the support of Achaeus. Now they knew that\r\nthe father of Achaeus was detained at Alexandria, and that Achaeus was\r\nexceedingly anxious for his father’s safety: they therefore hit upon\r\nthe idea of sending an embassy to Ptolemy, and asking him to deliver\r\nthis Andromachus to them. This request, indeed, they had before made,\r\nbut without laying any great stress upon it: now, however, they were\r\ngenuinely anxious for it; that, by doing this favour to Achaeus,\r\nthey might lay him under such an obligation to them, that he would\r\nbe unable to refuse any request they might make to him. When the\r\nambassadors arrived, Ptolemy at first deliberated as to detaining\r\nAndromachus; because there still remained some points of dispute\r\nbetween himself and Antiochus unsettled; and Achaeus, who had recently\r\ndeclared himself king, could exercise a decisive influence in several\r\nimportant particulars. For Andromachus was not only father of Achaeus,\r\nbut brother also of Laodice, the wife of Seleucus.[226] However, on a\r\nreview of the whole situation, Ptolemy inclined to the Rhodians; and\r\nbeing anxious to show them every favour, he yielded to their request,\r\nand handed over Andromachus to them to conduct to his son. Having\r\naccordingly done this, and having conferred some additional marks of\r\nhonour on Achaeus, they deprived the Byzantines of their most important\r\nhope. And this was not the only disappointment which the Byzantines\r\nhad to encounter; for as Tiboetes was being escorted from Macedonia,\r\nhe entirely defeated their plans by dying. This misfortune damped the\r\nardour of the Byzantines, while it encouraged Prusias to push on the\r\nwar. On the Asiatic side he carried it on in person, and with great\r\nenergy; while on the European side he hired Thracians who prevented the\r\nByzantines from leaving their gates. For their party being thus baulked\r\nof their hopes, and surrounded on every side by enemies, the Byzantines\r\nbegan to look about then for some decent pretext for withdrawing from\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gallic king, Cavarus, negotiates a peace, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ So when the Gallic king, Cavarus, came to Byzantium, and showed\r\nhimself eager to put an end to the war, and earnestly offered his\r\nfriendly intervention, both Prusias and the Byzantines consented to his\r\nproposals. And when the Rhodians were informed of the interference of\r\nCavarus and the consent of Prusias, being very anxious to secure their\r\nown object also, they elected Aridices as ambassador to Byzantium, and\r\nsent Polemocles with him in command of three triremes, wishing, as the\r\nsaying is, to send the Byzantines “spear and herald’s staff at once.”\r\nUpon their appearance a pacification was arranged, in the year of\r\nCothon, son of Callisthenes, Hieromnemon in Byzantium.[227] The treaty\r\nwith the Rhodians was simple: “The Byzantines will not collect toll\r\nfrom any ship sailing into the Pontus; and in that case the Rhodians\r\nand their allies are at peace with the Byzantines.” But that with\r\nPrusias contained the following provisions: “There shall be peace and\r\namity for ever between Prusias and the Byzantines; the Byzantines shall\r\nin no way attack Prusias, nor Prusias the Byzantines. Prusias shall\r\nrestore to Byzantines all lands, forts, populations, and prisoners\r\nof war, without ransom; and besides these things, the ships taken at\r\nthe beginning of the war, and the arms seized in the fortresses; and\r\nalso the timbers, stone-work, and roofing belonging to the fort called\r\nHieron” (for Prusias, in his terror of the approach of Tiboetes, had\r\npulled down every fort which seemed to lie conveniently for him):\r\n“finally, Prusias shall compel such of the Bithynians as have any\r\nproperty taken from the Byzantine district of Mysia to restore it to\r\nthe farmers.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the beginning and end of the war of Rhodes and Prusias with\r\nByzantium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War between Rhodes and Crete.]\r\n\r\n+53.+ At the same time the Cnossians sent an embassy to the Rhodians,\r\nand persuaded them to send them the ships that were under the command\r\nof Polemocles, and to launch three undecked vessels besides and send\r\nthem also to Crete. The Rhodians having complied, and the vessels\r\nhaving arrived at Crete, the people of Eleutherna suspecting that one\r\nof their citizens named Timarchus had been put to death by Polemocles\r\nto please the Cnossians, first proclaimed a right of reprisal against\r\nthe Rhodians, and then went to open war with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The destruction of Lyttos.]\r\n\r\nThe people of Lyttos,[228] too, a short time before this, met with an\r\nirretrievable disaster. At that time the political state of Crete as\r\na whole was this. The Cnossians, in league with the people of Gortyn,\r\nhad a short time previously reduced the whole island under their power,\r\nwith the exception of the city of Lyttos; and this being the only city\r\nwhich refused obedience, they resolved to go to war with it, being\r\nbent upon removing its inhabitants from their homes, as an example and\r\nterror to the rest of Crete. Accordingly at first the whole of the\r\nother Cretan cities were united in war against Lyttos: but presently\r\nwhen some jealousy arose from certain trifling causes, as is the way\r\nwith the Cretans, they separated into hostile parties, the peoples of\r\nPolyrrhen, Cere, and Lappa, along with the Horii and Arcades,[229]\r\nforming one party and separating themselves from connexion with the\r\nCnossians, resolved to make common cause with the Lyttians. Among the\r\npeople of Gortyn, again, the elder men espoused the side of Cnossus,\r\nthe younger that of Lyttos, and so were in opposition to each other.\r\nTaken by surprise by this disintegration of their allies, the Cnossians\r\nfetched over a thousand men from Aetolia in virtue of their alliance:\r\nupon which the party of the elders in Gortyn immediately seized the\r\ncitadel; introduced the Cnossians and Aetolians; and either expelled\r\nor put to death the young men, and delivered the city into the hands\r\nof the Cnossians. And at the same time, the Lyttians having gone out\r\nwith their full forces on an expedition into the enemy’s territory, the\r\nCnossians got information of the fact, and seized Lyttos while thus\r\ndenuded of its defenders. The children and women they sent to Cnossus;\r\nand having set fire to the town, thrown down its buildings, and damaged\r\nit in every possible way, returned. When the Lyttians reached home from\r\ntheir expedition, and saw what had happened, they were struck with\r\nsuch violent grief that not a man of the whole host had the heart to\r\nenter his native city; but one and all having marched round its walls,\r\nwith frequent cries and lamentations over their misfortune and that of\r\ntheir country, turned back again towards the city of Lappa. The people\r\nof Lappa gave them a kind and entirely cordial reception; and having\r\nthus in one day become cityless and aliens, they joined these allies in\r\ntheir war against the Cnossians. Thus at one fell swoop was Lyttos, a\r\ncolony of Sparta and allied with the Lacedaemonians in blood, the most\r\nancient of the cities in Crete, and by common consent the mother of the\r\nbravest men in the island, utterly cut off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appeal to the Achaeans and Philip.]\r\n\r\n+55.+ But the peoples of Polyrrhen and Lappa and all their allies,\r\nseeing that the Cnossians clung to the alliance of the Aetolians, and\r\nthat the Aetolians were at war with King Philip and the Achaeans,\r\nsent ambassadors to the two latter asking for their help and to be\r\nadmitted to alliance with them. Both requests were granted: they\r\nwere admitted into the roll of allies, and assistance was sent to\r\nthem, consisting of four hundred Illyrians under Plator, two hundred\r\nAchaeans, and a hundred Phocians; whose arrival was of the utmost\r\nadvantage to the interest of Polyrrhenia and her allies: for in a brief\r\nspace of time they shut the Eleuthernaeans and Cydonians within their\r\nwalls, and compelled the people of Aptera to forsake the alliance of\r\nthe Cnossians and share their fortunes. When these results had been\r\nobtained, the Polyrrhenians and their allies joined in sending to the\r\naid of Philip and the Achaeans five hundred Cretans, the Cnossians\r\nhaving sent a thousand to the Aetolians a short time before; both of\r\nwhich contingents took part in the existing war on their respective\r\nsides. Nay more, the exiled party of Gortyn seized the harbour of\r\nPhaestus,[230] and also by a sudden and bold attack occupied the port\r\nof Gortyn itself; and from these two places as bases of operation they\r\ncarried on the war with the party in the town. Such was the state of\r\nCrete.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mithridates IV., king of Pontus, declares war against\r\nSinope.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ About the same time Mithridates also declared war against the\r\npeople of Sinope; which proved to be the beginning and occasion of the\r\ndisaster which ultimately befell the Sinopeans. Upon their sending\r\nan embassy with a view to this war to beg for assistance from the\r\nRhodians, the latter decided to elect three men, and to grant them a\r\nhundred and forty thousand drachmae with which to procure supplies\r\nneeded by the Sinopeans. The men so appointed got ready ten thousand\r\njars of wine, three hundred talents[231] of prepared hair, a hundred\r\ntalents of made-up bowstring, a thousand suits of armour, three\r\nthousand gold pieces, and four catapults with engineers to work them.\r\nThe Sinopean envoys took these presents and departed; for the people\r\nof Sinope, being in great anxiety lest Mithridates should attempt\r\nto besiege them both by land and sea, were making all manner of\r\npreparations with this view. Sinope lies on the right-hand shore of the\r\nPontus as one sails to Phasis, and is built upon a peninsula jutting\r\nout into the sea: it is on the neck of this peninsula, connecting it\r\nwith Asia, which is not more than two stades wide, that the city is\r\nso placed as to entirely close it up from sea to sea; the rest of\r\nthe peninsula stretches out into the open sea,—a piece of flat land\r\nfrom which the town is easily accessible, but surrounded by a steep\r\ncoast offering very bad harbourage, and having exceedingly few spots\r\nadmitting of disembarkation. The Sinopeans then were dreadfully alarmed\r\nlest Mithridates should blockade them, by throwing up works against\r\ntheir town on the side towards Asia, and by making a descent on the\r\nopposite side upon the low ground in front of the town: and they\r\naccordingly determined to strengthen the line of the peninsula, where\r\nit was washed by the sea, by putting up wooden defences and erecting\r\npalisades round the places accessible from the sea; and at the same\r\ntime by storing weapons and stationing guards at all points open to\r\nattack: for the whole area is not large, but is capable of being easily\r\ndefended and by a moderate force.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation at Sinope at the time of the commencement of the\r\nSocial war,—to which I must now return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The History of the Social war resumed from ch. 37. Philip\r\nstarts for Aetolia, B.C. 219. Night surprise of Aegira.]\r\n\r\n+57.+ King Philip started from Macedonia with his army for Thessaly and\r\nEpirus, being bent on taking that route in his invasion of Aetolia.\r\nAnd at the same time Alexander and Dorimachus, having succeeded in\r\nestablishing an intrigue for the betrayal of Aegira, had collected\r\nabout twelve hundred Aetolians into Oeanthe, which is in Aetolia,\r\nexactly opposite the above-named town; and, having prepared vessels\r\nto convey them across the gulf, were waiting for favourable weather\r\nfor making the voyage in fulfilment of their design. For a deserter\r\nfrom Aetolia, who had spent a long time at Aegira, and had had full\r\nopportunity of observing that the guards of the gate towards Aegium\r\nwere in the habit of getting drunk, and keeping their watch with great\r\nslackness, had again and again crossed over to Dorimachus; and, laying\r\nthis fact before him, had invited him to make the attempt, well knowing\r\nthat he was thoroughly accustomed to such practices. The city of Aegira\r\nlies on the Peloponnesian coast of the Corinthian gulf, between the\r\ncities of Aegium and Sicyon, upon some strong and inaccessible heights,\r\nfacing towards Parnassus and that district of the opposite coast, and\r\nstanding about seven stades back from the sea. At the mouth of the\r\nriver which flows past this town Dorimachus dropped anchor under cover\r\nof night, having at length obtained favourable weather for crossing.\r\nHe and Alexander, accompanied by Archidamus the son of Pantaleon and\r\nthe main body of the Aetolians, then advanced towards the city along\r\nthe road leading from Aegium. But the deserter, with twenty of the\r\nmost active men, having made his way by a shorter cut than the others\r\nover the cliffs where there was no road, owing to his knowledge of the\r\nlocality, got into the city through a certain water-course and found\r\nthe guards of the gate still asleep. Having killed them while actually\r\nin their beds, and cut the bolts of the gates with their axes, they\r\nopened them to the Aetolians. Having thus surprised the town, they\r\nbehaved with a conspicuous want of caution, which eventually saved\r\nthe people of Aegira, and proved the destruction of the Aetolians\r\nthemselves. They seemed to imagine that to get within the gates was all\r\nthere was to do in occupying an enemy’s town; and accordingly acted as\r\nI shall now describe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander killed.]\r\n\r\n+58.+ They kept together for a very brief space of time near the\r\nmarket-place, and then scattering in every direction, in their passion\r\nfor plunder, rushed into the houses and began carrying off the wealth\r\nthey contained. But it was now broad daylight: and the attack being\r\nwholly unexpected and sudden, those of the Aegiratans whose houses\r\nwere actually entered by the enemy, in the utmost terror and alarm,\r\nall took to flight and made their way out of the town, believing it\r\nto be completely in the power of the enemy; but those of them whose\r\nhouses were untouched, and who, hearing the shouting, sallied out to\r\nthe rescue, all rushed with one accord to the citadel. These last\r\ncontinually increased in number and confidence; while the Aetolians on\r\nthe contrary kept continually becoming less closely united, and less\r\nsubject to discipline, from the causes above mentioned. But Dorimachus,\r\nbecoming conscious of his danger, rallied his men and charged the\r\ncitizens who were occupying the citadel: imagining that, by acting\r\nwith decision and boldness, he would terrify and turn to flight those\r\nwho had rallied to defend the town. But the Aegiratans, cheering each\r\nother on, offered a strenuous resistance, and grappled gallantly with\r\nthe Aetolians. The citadel being unwalled, and the struggle being at\r\nclose quarters and man to man, the battle was at first as desperate\r\nas might be expected between two sides, of which one was fighting for\r\ncountry and children, the other for bare life. Finally the invading\r\nAetolians were repulsed: and the Aegiratans, taking advantage of their\r\nhigher position, made a fierce and vigorous charge down the slope upon\r\nthe enemy; which struck such terror in them, that in the confusion\r\nthat followed the fugitives trampled each other to death at the gates.\r\nAlexander himself fell fighting in the actual battle; but Archidamus\r\nwas killed in the struggle and crush at the gates. Of the main body of\r\nAetolians, some were trampled to death; others flying over the pathless\r\nhills fell over precipices and broke their necks; while such as escaped\r\nin safety to the ships managed, after shamefully throwing away their\r\narms, to sail away and escape from what seemed a desperate danger.\r\nThus it came about that the Aegiratans having lost their city by their\r\ncarelessness, unexpectedly regained it by their valour and gallantry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Euripidas.]\r\n\r\n+59.+ About the same time Euripidas, who had been sent out to act\r\nas general to the Eleans, after overrunning the districts of Dyme,\r\nPharae, and Tritaea, and collecting a considerable amount of booty, was\r\nmarching back to Elis. But Miccus of Dyme, who happened at the time to\r\nbe Sub-strategus of the Achaean league, went out to the rescue with a\r\nbody of Dymaeans, Pharaeans, and Tritaeans, and attacked him as he was\r\nreturning. But proceeding too precipitately, he fell into an ambush\r\nand lost a large number of his men: for forty of his infantry were\r\nkilled and about two hundred taken prisoners. Elated by this success,\r\nEuripidas a few days afterwards made another expedition, and seized\r\na fort belonging to the Dymaeans on the river Araxus, standing in an\r\nexcellent situation, and called the Wall, which the myths affirm to\r\nhave been anciently built by Hercules, when at war with the Eleans, as\r\na base of operations against them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inactivity of Aratus. Dyme, Pharae, and Tritaea separate\r\nfrom the league.]\r\n\r\n+60.+ The peoples of Dyme, Pharae, and Tritaea having been worsted in\r\ntheir attempt to relieve the country, and afraid of what would happen\r\nfrom this capture of the fort, first sent messengers to the Strategus,\r\nAratus, to inform him of what had happened and to ask for aid, and\r\nafterwards a formal embassy with the same request. But Aratus was\r\nunable to get the mercenaries together, because in the Cleomenic war\r\nthe Achaeans had failed to pay some of the wages of the hired troops:\r\nand his entire policy and management of the whole war was in a word\r\nwithout spirit or nerve. Accordingly Lycurgus seized the Athenaeum of\r\nMegalopolis, and Euripidas followed up his former successes by taking\r\nGortyna[232] in the territory of Telphusa. But the people of Dyme,\r\nPharae, and Tritaea, despairing of assistance from the Strategus,\r\ncame to a mutual agreement to cease paying the common contribution\r\nto the Achaean league, and to collect a mercenary army on their own\r\naccount, three hundred infantry and fifty horse; and to secure the\r\ncountry by their means. In this action they were considered to have\r\nshown a prudent regard for their own interests, but not for those of\r\nthe community at large; for they were thought to have set an evil\r\nexample, and supplied a precedent to those whose wish it was to break\r\nup the league. But in fact the chief blame for their proceeding must\r\nrightfully be assigned to the Strategus, who pursued such a dilatory\r\npolicy, and slighted or wholly rejected the prayers for help which\r\nreached him from time to time. For as long as he has any hope, from\r\nrelations and allies, any man who is in danger will cling to them; but\r\nwhen in his distress he has to give up that hope, he is forced to help\r\nhimself the best way he can. Wherefore we must not find fault with the\r\npeople of Tritaea, Pharae, and Dyme for having mercenaries on their own\r\naccount, when the chief magistrate of the league hesitated to act: but\r\nsome blame does attach to them for renouncing the joint contribution.\r\nThey certainly were not bound to neglect to secure their own safety by\r\nevery opportunity and means in their power; but they were bound at the\r\nsame time to keep up their just dues to the league: especially as the\r\nrecovery of such payment was perfectly secured to them by the common\r\nlaws; and most of all because they had been the originators of the\r\nAchaean confederacy.[233]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip V. at Ambracia, B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n+61.+ Such was the state of things in the Peloponnese when King\r\nPhilip, after crossing Thessaly, arrived in Epirus. Reinforcing his\r\nMacedonians by a full levy of Epirotes, and being joined by three\r\nhundred slingers from Achaia, and the five hundred Cretans sent him by\r\nthe Polyrrhenians, he continued his march through Epirus and arrived\r\nin the territory of the Ambracians. Now, if he had continued his march\r\nwithout interruption, and thrown himself into the interior of Aetolia,\r\nby the sudden and unlooked-for attack of so formidable an army he\r\nwould have put an end to the whole campaign: but as it was, he was\r\nover-persuaded by the Epirotes to take Ambracus first; and so gave the\r\nAetolians an interval in which to make a stand, to take precautionary\r\nmeasures, and to prepare for the future. For the Epirotes, thinking\r\nmore of their own advantage than of that of the confederacy, and being\r\nvery anxious to get Ambracus[234] into their power, begged Philip to\r\ninvest the town and take it before doing anything else: the fact being\r\nthat they regarded it as a matter of the utmost importance to recover\r\nAmbracia from the Aetolians; and thought that the only way of doing\r\nthis was to become masters of this place, Ambracus, and besiege the\r\ntown of Ambracia from it. For Ambracus is a place strongly fortified by\r\nwalls and out-works, standing in the midst of marshes, and approached\r\nfrom the land by only one narrow raised causeway; and commanding by its\r\nsituation both the district and town of Ambracia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scopas tries to effect a diversion by invading Macedonia. On\r\nhis return he destroys Dium.]\r\n\r\n+62.+ While Philip, then, by the persuasion of the Epirotes, pitching\r\nhis camp near Ambracus, was engaged in making his preparations for\r\nthe siege, Scopas raised a general levy of Aetolians, and marching\r\nthrough Thessaly crossed the frontiers of Macedonia; traversed the\r\nplain of Plena, and laid it waste; and after securing considerable\r\nbooty, returned by the road leading to Dium. The inhabitants of that\r\ntown abandoning the place, he entered it and threw down its walls,\r\nhouses, and gymnasium; set fire to the covered walks round the sacred\r\nenclosure, and destroyed all the other offerings which had been placed\r\nin it, either for ornament, or for the use of visitors to the public\r\nassemblies, and threw down all the statues of the kings. And this\r\nman, who, at the very beginning and first action of the war, had thus\r\nturned his arms against the gods as well as men, was not treated on his\r\nreturn to Aetolia as guilty of impiety, but was honoured and looked\r\nup to. For he had indeed filled the Aetolians with empty hopes and\r\nirrational conceit. From this time they indulged the idea that no one\r\nwould venture to set foot in Aetolia, while they would be able without\r\nresistance not only to plunder the Peloponnese, which they were quite\r\naccustomed to do, but Thessaly and Macedonia also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambracus taken.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip enters Aetolia; takes Phoeteiae.]\r\n\r\n+63.+ When he heard what had happened in Macedonia, and had thus paid\r\non the spot for the selfishness and folly of the Epirotes, Philip\r\nproceeded to besiege Ambracus. By an energetic use of earthworks,\r\nand other siege operations, he quickly terrified the people into\r\nsubmission, and the place surrendered after a delay of forty days in\r\nall. He let the garrison, consisting of five hundred Aetolians, depart\r\non fixed conditions, and gratified the cupidity of the Epirotes by\r\nhanding over Ambracus to them, while he himself set his army in motion,\r\nand marched by way of Charadra, being anxious to cross the Ambracian\r\ngulf where it is narrowest, that is to say, near the Acarnanian temple\r\ncalled Actium. For this gulf is a branch of the Sicilian sea between\r\nEpirus and Acarnania, with a very narrow opening of less than five\r\nstades, but expanding as it extends inland to a breadth of a hundred\r\nstades; while the length of the whole arm from the open sea is about\r\nthree hundred stades. It forms the boundary between Epirus on the north\r\nand Acarnania on the south. Philip, therefore, having got his army\r\nacross this entrance of the gulf, and advanced through Acarnania, came\r\nto the city of Phoeteiae, which belonged to the Aetolians;[235] having,\r\nduring his march, been joined by an Acarnanian force of two thousand\r\nfoot and two hundred horse. Encamping under the walls of this town,\r\nand making energetic and formidable assaults upon it during two days,\r\nit was surrendered to him on terms, and the Aetolian garrison were\r\ndismissed on parole. Next night, however, five hundred other Aetolians,\r\nbelieving the town still untaken, came to its relief; whose arrival\r\nbeing ascertained beforehand by the king, he stationed some men in\r\nambush at certain convenient spots, and slew most of the new-comers\r\nand captured all but a very few of the rest. After these events, he\r\ndistributed a month’s rations of corn among his men from what had been\r\ncaptured, for a large store was found collected at Phoeteiae, and\r\nthen continued his advance into the territory of Stratus. At about\r\nten stades from that town he pitched his camp on the banks of the\r\nriver Achelous; and from that began laying waste the country without\r\nresistance, none of the enemy venturing out to attack him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Metropolis and Conope.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Skirmish on the Achelous.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ithoria.]\r\n\r\n+64.+ Meanwhile the Achaeans, being hard pressed by the war, and\r\nascertaining that the king was not far off, sent ambassadors to him\r\nbegging for help. They found Philip still in his camp near Stratus,\r\nand there delivered their commission: and besides the message with\r\nwhich they were charged, they pointed out to him the richness of the\r\nbooty which his army would get from the enemy’s country, and tried to\r\npersuade him to cross to Rhium and invade Elis. The king listened to\r\nwhat they had to say, and kept the ambassadors with him, alleging that\r\nhe must consider of their request; and meanwhile broke up his camp,\r\nand marched in the direction of Metropolis and Conope. The Aetolians\r\nkept possession of the citadel of Metropolis but abandoned the town:\r\nwhereupon Philip set fire to Metropolis, and continued his advance\r\nagainst Conope. But when the Aetolian horse rallied and ventured to\r\nmeet him at the ford of the Achelous, which is about twenty stades\r\nbefore you reach the town, believing that they would either stop his\r\nadvance altogether, or inflict much damage on the Macedonians while\r\ncrossing the river; the king, fully understanding their tactics,\r\nordered his light-armed troops to enter the river first and to cross it\r\nin close order, keeping to their regular companies, and with shields\r\ninterlocked. His orders were obeyed: and as soon as the first company\r\nhad effected the crossing, the Aetolian cavalry attacked it; but\r\nthey could make no impression upon it, standing as it did in close\r\norder, and being joined in similar close order, shield to shield, by\r\na second and a third company as they crossed. Therefore they wheeled\r\noff discomfited and retired to the city. From this time forth the\r\nproud gallantry of the Aetolians was fain to confine itself to the\r\nprotection of the towns, and keep quiet; while Philip crossed with his\r\narmy, and after wasting this district also without resistance, arrived\r\nat Ithoria. This is a position completely commanding the road, and of\r\nextraordinary strength, natural as well as artificial. On his approach,\r\nhowever, the garrison occupying the place abandoned it in a panic; and\r\nthe king, taking possession, levelled it to the ground: and gave orders\r\nto his skirmishing parties to treat all forts in the district in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paeanium.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fortifies Oeniadae.]\r\n\r\n+65.+ Having thus passed the narrow part of the road, he proceeded\r\nat a slow and deliberate pace, giving his army time to collect booty\r\nfrom the country; and by the time he reached Oeniadae his army was\r\nrichly provided with every kind of goods. But he resolved first to\r\ntake Paeanium: and having pitched his camp under its walls, by a\r\nseries of assaults carried the place by force,—a town not large in\r\ncircumference, for that was less than seven stades, but second to none\r\nin the construction of its houses, walls, and towers. The wall of this\r\ntown he levelled with its foundation, and, breaking down its houses,\r\nhe packed their timbers and tiles with great care upon rafts, and sent\r\nthem down the river to Oeniadae. At first the Aetolians resolved to\r\nhold the citadel in Oeniadae, which they had strengthened with walls\r\nand other fortifications; but upon Philip’s approach they evacuated it\r\nin a panic. The king therefore having taken this city also, advanced\r\nfrom it and encamped on a certain secure position in Calydonia, called\r\nElaeus, which had been rendered extraordinarily strong with walls\r\nand other fortifications by Attalus, who undertook the work for the\r\nAetolians. Having carried this also by assault, and plundered the whole\r\nof Calydonia, the Macedonians returned to Oeniadae. And observing the\r\nconvenient position of this place for all purposes, and especially as\r\nproviding a place of embarkation for the Peloponnese, Philip resolved\r\nto build a wall round the town. For Oeniadae lies on the sea-coast,\r\nat the juncture of the Acarnanian and Aetolian frontiers, just at the\r\nentrance of the Corinthian gulf; and the town faces the sea-coast of\r\nDyme in the Peloponnesus, and is the nearest point to the promontory of\r\nAraxus in it; for the intervening sea is not more than a hundred stades\r\nacross. Looking to these facts he fortified the citadel by itself;\r\nand, building a wall round the harbour and dockyards, was intending\r\nto connect them with the citadel, employing for the construction the\r\nmaterials brought from Paeanium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip recalled to Macedonia by a threatened invasion of\r\nDardani.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Late summer of B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n+66.+ But whilst he was still engaged on this work, news was brought\r\nto the king that the Dardani, suspecting his intention of invading\r\nthe Peloponnese, were collecting forces and making great preparations\r\nwith the determination of invading Macedonia. When he heard this,\r\nPhilip made up his mind that he was bound to go with all speed to the\r\nprotection of Macedonia: and accordingly he dismissed the Achaean\r\nenvoys with the answer, which he now gave them, that when he had taken\r\neffectual measures with regard to the circumstances that had just been\r\nannounced to him, he would look upon it as his first business to bring\r\nthem aid to the best of his ability. Thereupon he broke up his camp,\r\nand began his return march with all speed, by the same route as that by\r\nwhich he had come. When he was on the point of recrossing the Ambracian\r\ngulf from Acarnania into Epirus, Demetrius of Pharos presented himself,\r\nsailing with a single galley, having just been banished from Illyria by\r\nthe Romans,—as I have stated in the previous book.[236] Philip received\r\nhim with kindness and bade him sail to Corinth, and go thence through\r\nThessaly to Macedonia; while he himself crossed into Epirus and pushed\r\non without a halt. When he had reached Pella in Macedonia, the Dardani\r\nlearnt from some Thracian deserters that he was in the country, and\r\nthey at once in a panic broke up their army, though they were close to\r\nthe Macedonian frontier. And Philip, being informed of their change of\r\npurpose, dismissed his Macedonian soldiers to gather in their harvest:\r\nwhile he himself went to Thessaly, and spent the rest of the summer at\r\nLarisa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contemporary events in Spain and Italy.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this season that Aemilius celebrated a splendid triumph at\r\nRome for his Illyrian victories; and Hannibal after the capture of\r\nSaguntum dismissed his troops into winter quarters; while the Romans,\r\non hearing of the capture of Saguntum, were sending ambassadors to\r\nCarthage to demand the surrender of Hannibal, and at the same time were\r\nmaking preparations for the war after electing Publius Cornelius Scipio\r\nand Tiberius Sempronius Longus Consuls for the following year, as I\r\nhave stated in detail in the previous book. My object in recalling the\r\nfacts here is to carry out my original plan of showing what events in\r\nvarious parts of the world were contemporaneous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Midsummer B.C. 217. Dorimachus Aetolian Strategus, Sept.\r\nB.C. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destroys Dodona.]\r\n\r\n+67.+ And so the first year of this Olympiad was drawing to a close.\r\nIn Aetolia, the time of the elections having come round, Dorimachus\r\nwas elected Strategus. He was no sooner invested with his office,\r\nthan, summoning the Aetolian forces, he made an armed foray upon\r\nthe highlands of Epirus, and began wasting the country with an even\r\nstronger passion for destruction than usual; for his object in\r\neverything he did was not so much to secure booty for himself, as\r\nto damage the Epirotes. And having come to Dodona[237] he burnt the\r\ncolonnades, destroyed the sacred offerings, and even demolished the\r\nsacred building; so that we may say that the Aetolians had no regard\r\nfor the laws of peace or war, but in the one as well as in the other,\r\nacted in defiance of the customs and principles of mankind. After\r\nthose, and other similar achievements, Dorimachus returned home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip starts again.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dec. B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\nBut the winter being now considerably advanced, and all idea of the\r\nking coming being given up owing to the time of the year, Philip\r\nsuddenly started from Larisa with an army of three thousand hoplites\r\narmed with brass shields, two thousand light-armed, three hundred\r\nCretans, and four hundred horse of the royal guard; and having\r\ntransported them into Euboea and thence to Cynos he came through\r\nBoeotia and the Megarid to Corinth, about the time of the winter\r\nsolstice; having conducted his arrival with such promptitude and\r\nsecrecy, that not a single Peloponnesian suspected it. He at once\r\nclosed the gates of Corinth and secured the roads by guards; and on the\r\nvery next day sent for Aratus the elder to come to him from Sicyon,\r\nand issued despatches to the Strategus of the Achaean league and the\r\ncities, in which he named a time and place for them all to meet him in\r\narms. Having made these arrangements, he again started, and pitched his\r\ncamp near the temple of the Dioscuri in Phliasia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 218, Jan.-Feb. Destruction of a marauding army of\r\nEleans under Euripidas.]\r\n\r\n+68.+ Meanwhile Euripidas, with two companies of Eleans,—who combined\r\nwith the pirates and mercenaries made up an army of two thousand two\r\nhundred men, besides a hundred horse,—started from Psophis and began\r\nmarching by way of Pheneus and Stymphalus, knowing nothing about\r\nPhilip’s arrival, with the purpose of wasting the territory of Sicyon.\r\nThe very night in which it chanced that Philip had pitched his camp\r\nnear the temple of the Dioscuri, he passed the royal quarters, and\r\nsucceeded in entering the territory of Sicyon, about the time of the\r\nmorning watch. But some Cretans of Philip’s army who had left their\r\nranks, and were prowling about on the track of prey, fell into the\r\nhands of Euripidas, and being questioned by him informed him of the\r\narrival of the Macedonians. Without saying a word of his discovery to\r\nany one, he at once caused his army to face about, and marched back\r\nby the same road as that by which he had come; with the intention and\r\nhope of getting through Stymphalia, and reaching the difficult ground\r\nbeyond it, before the Macedonians could catch him. But the king knowing\r\nnothing at all about the proceedings of the enemy, at daybreak broke\r\nup his camp and began his advance in pursuance of his original plan,\r\ndetermining to march by way of Stymphalus itself to Caphyae: for it was\r\nat that town that he had written to the Achaeans to meet him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Eleans come across the Macedonians at the junction of\r\nthe two roads above Stymphalus.]\r\n\r\n+69.+ Now it happened that, just as the Macedonian advanced guard\r\ncame to the top of the hill, near a place called Apelaurus, about\r\nten stades before you come to Stymphalus, the advanced guard of\r\nthe Eleans converged upon it also. Understanding from his previous\r\ninformation what had happened, Euripidas took some horsemen with him\r\nand avoided the danger by flight, making his way across country to\r\nPsophis. The rest of the Eleans being thus deserted by their leader,\r\nand panic-struck at what had happened, remained stationary on the\r\nroad, not knowing what to do, or which way to turn. For at first their\r\nofficers imagined that the troops they saw were some Achaeans come\r\nout to resist them. What favoured this mistake more than anything\r\nelse were the brass shields of the hoplites: for they imagined that\r\nthey were Megalopolitans, because the soldiers of that town had borne\r\nshields of that sort at the battle of Sellasia against Cleomenes, King\r\nAntigonus having furnished them for the occasion. Under this idea, they\r\nretired in good order to some rising ground, by no means despairing of\r\ngetting off safely: but as soon as the Macedonians had advanced close\r\nup to them, grasping the true state of the case, they threw down their\r\nshields and fled. About twelve hundred of them were taken prisoners;\r\nbut the rest perished utterly, some at the hands of the Macedonians,\r\nand others by falling down precipices: and finally not more than a\r\nhundred altogether escaped. Having despatched the spoils and the\r\nprisoners to Corinth, Philip continued his expedition. But a great\r\nimpression was made upon the Peloponnesians: for they had not heard of\r\nthe king’s arrival until they heard of his victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip advances to Psophis.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A description of Psophis.]\r\n\r\n+70.+ Continuing his march through Arcadia, and encountering heavy snow\r\nstorms and much fatigue in the pass over Mount Oligyrtus, he arrived on\r\nthe third day at Caphyae. There he rested his army for two days, and\r\nwas joined by Aratus the younger, and the Achaean soldiers whom he had\r\ncollected; so that, with an army now amounting to ten thousand men,\r\nhe advanced by way of Clitoria towards Psophis, collecting missiles\r\nand scaling ladders from the towns through which he passed. Psophis is\r\na place of acknowledged antiquity, and a colony of the Arcadian town\r\nof Azanis. Taking the Peloponnesus as a whole, it occupies a central\r\nposition in the country; but in regard to Arcadia it is on its western\r\nfrontier, and is close also to the western borderland of Achaia: its\r\nposition also commands the territory of the Eleans, with whom at that\r\ntime it was politically united. Philip reached this town on the third\r\nday after leaving Caphyae, and pitched his camp on some rising ground\r\noverhanging the city, from which he could in perfect security command\r\na view both of the whole town and the country round it. But when the\r\nking saw the great strength of the place, he was at a loss what to do.\r\nAlong the left side of it rushes a violent winter torrent, which for\r\nthe greater part of the winter is impassable, and in any case renders\r\nthe city secure and difficult of approach, owing to the size of the\r\nbed which its waters have worn out for themselves by slow degrees, in\r\nthe course of ages, as it comes rushing down from the higher ground.\r\nOn the east again there is a broad and rapid river, the Erymanthus,\r\nabout which so many tales are told. This river is joined by the\r\nwinter torrent at a point south of the town, which is thus defended\r\non three sides by these streams; while the fourth, or northern, side\r\nis commanded by a hill, which has been fortified, and serves as a\r\nconvenient and efficient citadel. The town has walls also of unusual\r\nsize and construction; and besides all this, a reinforcement of Eleans\r\nhappened to have just come in, and Euripidas himself was in the town\r\nafter his escape from Stymphalus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Psophis.]\r\n\r\n+71.+ The sight of these things caused Philip much anxious thought.\r\nSometimes he was for giving up his plan of attacking and besieging\r\nthe place: at others the excellence of its situation made him eager\r\nto accomplish this. For just as it was then a source of danger to the\r\nAchaeans and Arcadians, and a safe place of arms for the Eleans; so\r\nwould it on the other hand, if captured, become a source of safety\r\nto the Arcadians, and a most convenient base of operations for the\r\nallies against the Eleans. These considerations finally decided him to\r\nmake the attempt: and he therefore issued orders to the Macedonians\r\nto get their breakfasts at daybreak, and be ready for service with\r\nall preparations completed. Everything being done as he ordered, the\r\nking led his army over the bridge across the Erymanthus; and no one\r\nhaving offered him resistance, owing to the unexpectedness of the\r\nmovement, he arrived under the walls of the town in gallant style and\r\nwith formidable show. Euripidas and the garrison were overpowered\r\nwith astonishment; because they had felt certain that the enemy would\r\nnot venture on an assault, or try to carry a town of such strength;\r\nand that a siege could not last long either, owing to the severity of\r\nthe season. This calculation of chances made them begin to entertain\r\nsuspicions of each other, from a misgiving that Philip must have\r\nestablished a secret intrigue with some persons in the town against\r\nit. But finding that nothing of the sort existed among themselves, the\r\ngreater number hurried to the walls to defend them, while the mercenary\r\nElean soldiers sallied out of a gate in the upper part of the town\r\nto attack the enemy. The king stationed his men who had ladders at\r\nthree different spots, and divided the other Macedonians among these\r\nthree parties; this being arranged, he gave the signal by the sound\r\nof trumpet, and began the assault on the walls at once. At first the\r\ngarrison offered a spirited resistance and hurled many of the enemy\r\nfrom their ladders; but when the supply of weapons inside the town, as\r\nwell as other necessary materials, began to run short,—as was to be\r\nexpected from the hasty nature of the preparations for defence,—and the\r\nMacedonians showed no sign of terror, the next man filling up the place\r\nof each who was hurled from the scaling-ladder, the garrison at length\r\nturned to flight, and made their escape one and all into the citadel.\r\nIn the king’s army the Macedonians then made good their footing on\r\nthe wall, while the Cretans went against the party of mercenaries who\r\nhad sallied from the upper gate, and forced them to throw away their\r\nshields and fly in disorder. Following the fugitives with slaughter,\r\nthey forced their way along with them through the gate: so that the\r\ntown was captured at all points at once. The Psophidians with their\r\nwives and children retreated into the citadel, and Euripidas with them,\r\nas well as all the soldiers who had escaped destruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrender of the citadel of Psophis.]\r\n\r\n+72.+ Having thus carried the place, the Macedonians at once plundered\r\nall the furniture of the houses; and then, setting up their quarters\r\nin the houses, took regular possession of the town. But the people\r\nwho had taken refuge in a body in the citadel, having no provisions\r\nwith them, and well foreseeing what must happen, made up their minds\r\nto give themselves up to Philip. They accordingly sent a herald to\r\nthe king; and having received a safe-conduct for an embassy, they\r\ndespatched their magistrates and Euripidas with them on this mission,\r\nwho made terms with the king by which the lives and liberties of all\r\nwho were on the citadel, whether citizens or foreigners, were secured.\r\nThe ambassadors then returned whence they came, carrying an order to\r\nthe people to remain where they were until the army had marched out,\r\nfor fear any of the soldiers should disobey orders and plunder them. A\r\nfall of snow however compelled the king to remain where he was for some\r\ndays; in the course of which he summoned a meeting of such Achaeans\r\nas were in the army, and after pointing out to them the strength and\r\nexcellent position of the town for the purposes of the present war,\r\nhe spoke also of his own friendly disposition towards their nation:\r\nand ended by saying, “We hereby yield up and present this town to\r\nthe Achaeans; for it is our purpose to show them all the favour in\r\nour power, and to omit nothing that may testify to our zeal.” After\r\nreceiving the thanks of Aratus and the meeting, Philip dismissed the\r\nassembly, and getting his army in motion, marched towards Lasion. The\r\nPsophidians descending from the citadel received back the possession of\r\nthe town, each man recovering his own house; while Euripidas departed\r\nto Corinth, and thence to Aetolia. Those of the Achaean magistrates who\r\nwere present put Prolaus of Sicyon in command of the citadel, with an\r\nadequate garrison; and Pythias of Pallene in command of the town. Such\r\nwas the end of the incident of Psophis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lasion and Stratus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip at Olympia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prosperity of Elis.]\r\n\r\n+73.+ But when the Elean garrison of Lasion heard of the coming of the\r\nMacedonians, and were informed of what had taken place at Psophis, they\r\nat once abandoned the town; so that upon his arrival the king took it\r\nimmediately, and by way of enhancing his favours to the Achaeans handed\r\nLasion also over to them; and in a similar spirit restored Stratus\r\nto the Telphusians, which was also evacuated by the Eleans. On the\r\nfifth day after settling these matters he arrived at Olympia. There he\r\noffered a sacrifice to Zeus and entertained his officers at a banquet;\r\nand, having given his army three days’ rest, commenced his return\r\nmarch. After advancing some way into Elis, he allowed foraging parties\r\nto scour the country while he himself lay encamped near Artemisium, as\r\nit is called; and after receiving the booty there, he removed to the\r\nDioscurium.[238] In the course of this devastation of the country the\r\nnumber of the captives was indeed great, but a still greater number\r\nmade their escape to the neighbouring villages and strongholds. For\r\nElis is more populous, as well as more richly furnished with slaves\r\nand other property, than the rest of the Peloponnese: and some of the\r\nEleans are so enamoured of a country life, that there are cases of\r\nfamilies who, being in enjoyment of considerable wealth, have for two\r\nor three generations never entered a public law-court at all.[239]\r\nAnd this result is brought about by the great care and attention\r\nbestowed upon the agricultural class by the government, to see that\r\ntheir law-suits should be settled on the spot, and every necessary of\r\nlife abundantly supplied them. To me it seems that they owed these\r\nlaws and customs originally to the wide extent of their arable land,\r\nand still more to the fact that their lives were under the protection\r\nof religion; for, owing to the Olympic assembly, their territory\r\nwas especially exempted by the Greeks from pillage; and they had\r\naccordingly been free from all injury and hostile invasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ancient privileges of Elis lost.]\r\n\r\n+74.+ But in the course of time, when the Arcadians advanced a claim\r\nfor Lasion and the whole district of Pisa, being forced to defend\r\ntheir territory and change their habits of life, they no longer\r\ntroubled themselves in the least about recovering from the Greeks\r\ntheir ancient and ancestral immunity from pillage, but were content to\r\nremain exactly as they were. This in my opinion was a short-sighted\r\npolicy. For peace is a thing we all desire, and are willing to submit\r\nto anything to obtain: it is the only one of our so-called blessings\r\nthat no one questions. If then there are people who, having the\r\nopportunity of obtaining it, with justice and honour, from the Greeks,\r\nwithout question and for perpetuity, neglect to do so, or regard other\r\nobjects as of superior importance to it, must we not look upon them\r\nas undoubtedly blind to their true interests? But if it be objected\r\nthat, by adopting such a mode of life, they would become easily open\r\nto attack and exposed to treachery: I answer that such an event would\r\nbe rare, and if it did happen, would be a claim on the aid of united\r\nGreece; but that for minor injuries, having all the wealth which\r\nunbroken peace would be sure to bring them, they would never have\r\nbeen at a loss for foreign soldiers or mercenaries to protect them at\r\ncertain places and times. As it is, from dread of what is occasional\r\nand unlikely, they involve their country and property in perpetual wars\r\nand losses.\r\n\r\nMy object in thus speaking is to admonish the Eleans: for they have\r\nnever had a more favourable time than the present to get back their\r\nancient privilege of exemption from pillage, which is universally\r\nacknowledged to belong to them. Even now, some sparks, so to speak, of\r\ntheir old habit remaining, Elis is more thickly populated than other\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Thalamae.]\r\n\r\n+75.+ And therefore during Philip’s occupation of the country the\r\nnumber of prisoners taken was immense; and the number of those who\r\nescaped by flight still greater. An enormous amount of movable\r\nproperty, and an enormous crowd of slaves and cattle, were collected at\r\na place called Thalamae; which was selected for the purpose, because\r\nthe approach to it was narrow and difficult, and the place itself\r\nwas retired and not easy to enter. But when the king was informed\r\nof the number of those who had taken refuge in this place, resolved\r\nto leave nothing unattempted or incomplete, he occupied certain\r\nspots which commanded the approach to it, with his mercenaries:\r\nwhile leaving his baggage and main army in his entrenched camp, he\r\nhimself led his peltasts and light-armed troops through the gorge,\r\nand, without meeting with any resistance, came directly under the\r\nfortress. The fugitives were panic-stricken at his approach: for\r\nthey were utterly inexperienced in war and unprovided with means of\r\ndefence,—a mere rabble hurriedly collected together; they therefore\r\nat once surrendered, and among them two hundred mercenary soldiers,\r\nof various nationalities, who had been brought there by Amphidamas\r\nthe Elean Strategus. Having thus become master of an immense booty in\r\ngoods, and of more than five thousand slaves, and having in addition\r\nto these driven off an incalculable number of cattle, Philip now\r\nreturned to his camp; but finding his army overburdened with spoils of\r\nevery description, and rendered by that means cumbrous and useless for\r\nservice, he retraced his steps, and once more marched to Olympia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oppressive conduct of Apelles to the Achaeans.]\r\n\r\n+76.+ But now a difficulty arose which was created by Apelles. Apelles\r\nwas one of those who had been left by Antigonus as guardians of his\r\nson, and had, as it happened, more influence than any one else with\r\nthe king. He conceived the wish to bring the Achaeans into the same\r\nposition as the Thessalians; and adopted for that purpose a very\r\noffensive line of conduct. The Thessalians were supposed to enjoy\r\ntheir own constitution, and to have quite a different status to the\r\nMacedonians; but in fact they had exactly the same, and obeyed every\r\norder of the royal ministers. It was with the purpose of bringing about\r\nthe same state of things, that this officer now set himself to test the\r\nsubservience of the Achaean contingent. At first he confined himself\r\nto giving the Macedonian soldiers leave to eject Achaeans from their\r\nquarters, who on any occasion had taken possession of them first, as\r\nwell as to wrest from them any booty they might have taken; but he\r\nafterwards treated them with actual violence, through the agency of\r\nhis subordinates, on any trifling pretext; while such as complained of\r\nthis treatment, or took the part of those who were being beaten, he\r\npersonally arrested and put into confinement: being convinced that by\r\nthis method he would gradually and imperceptibly bring them into the\r\nhabit of submitting, without remonstrance, to any thing which the king\r\nmight choose to inflict. And this opinion he deduced from his previous\r\nexperience in the army of Antigonus, when he had seen the Achaeans\r\nwilling to endure any hardship, on the one condition of escaping from\r\nthe yoke of Cleomenes. However, certain young Achaeans held a meeting,\r\nand going to Aratus explained to him the policy which was being pursued\r\nby Apelles: whereupon Aratus at once went to Philip, feeling that a\r\nstand must be made on this point at once and without delay. He made his\r\nstatement to the king; who, being informed of the facts, first of all\r\nencouraged the young men by a promise that nothing of the sort should\r\nhappen to them again; and then commanded Apelles not to impose any\r\norders upon the Achaeans without consulting their own Strategus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Philip V.]\r\n\r\n+77.+ Philip, then, was acquiring a great reputation, not only among\r\nthose actually in his army, but among the other Peloponnesians also,\r\nfor his behaviour to the allies serving with him, as well as for his\r\nability and courage in the field. Indeed it would not be easy to find a\r\nking endowed with more natural qualities requisite for the acquisition\r\nof power. He had in an eminent degree a quick understanding, a\r\nretentive memory, and a winning grace of manner, joined to a look of\r\nroyal dignity and authority; and most important of all, ability and\r\ncourage as a general. What neutralised all these excellent qualities,\r\nand made a cruel tyrant of a naturally well-disposed king, it is not\r\neasy to say in a few words: and therefore that inquiry must be reserved\r\nfor a more suitable time than the present.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip continues his campaign.]\r\n\r\nStarting from Olympia by the road leading to Pharae, Philip came first\r\nto Telphusa, and thence to Heraea. There he had the booty sold by\r\nauction, and repaired the bridge over the Alpheus, with the view of\r\npassing over it to the invasion of Triphylia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of Aetolian troops under Phillidas, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Triphylia.]\r\n\r\nJust at that time the Aetolian Strategus, Dorimachus, in answer to\r\na request of the Eleans for protection against the devastation they\r\nwere enduring, despatched six hundred Aetolians, under the command\r\nof Phillidas, to their aid. Having arrived in Elis, and taken over\r\nthe Elean mercenaries, who were five hundred in number, as well as a\r\nthousand citizen soldiers and the Tarentine cavalry,[240] he marched to\r\nthe relief of Triphylia. This district is so called from Triphylus, one\r\nof the sons of Arcas, and lies on the coast of the Peloponnese between\r\nElis and Messenia, facing the Libyan Sea, and touching the south-west\r\nfrontier of Arcadia. It contains the following towns, Samicum, Lepreum,\r\nHypana, Typaneae, Pyrgos, Aepium, Bolax, Stylangium, Phrixa; all of\r\nwhich, shortly before this, the Eleans had conquered and annexed, as\r\nwell as the city of Alipheira, which had originally been subject to\r\nArcadia and Megalopolis, but had been exchanged with the Eleans, for\r\nsome private object of his own, by Lydiadas when tyrant of Megalopolis.\r\n\r\n+78.+ Phillidas, then, sent his Elean troops to Lepreum, and his\r\nmercenaries to Aliphera; while he himself went with the Aetolian troops\r\nto Typaneae, and waited to see what would happen. Meanwhile the king,\r\nhaving got rid of his heavy baggage, and crossed the bridge over the\r\nriver Alpheus, which flows right under Heraea, came to Alipheira, which\r\nlies on a hill precipitous on every side, and the ascent of which is\r\nmore than ten stades. The citadel is on the very summit of this hill,\r\nadorned with a colossal statue of Athene, of extraordinary size and\r\nbeauty. The origin and purpose of this statue, and at whose expense it\r\nwas set up, are doubtful questions even among the natives; for it has\r\nnever been clearly discovered why or by whom it was dedicated: yet it\r\nis universally allowed that its skilful workmanship classes it among\r\nthe most splendid and artistic productions of Hecatodorus[241] and\r\nSostratus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Alipheira.]\r\n\r\nThe next morning being fine and bright, the king made his dispositions\r\nat daybreak. He placed parties of men with scaling ladders at several\r\npoints, and supported each of them with bodies of mercenaries, and\r\ndetachments of Macedonian hoplites, on the rear of these several\r\nparties. His orders being fulfilled with enthusiasm and a formidable\r\ndisplay of power, the garrison of Alipheira were kept continually\r\nrushing and rallying to the particular spots to which they saw the\r\nMacedonians approaching: and while this was going on, the king himself\r\ntook some picked men, and mounted unobserved over some steep hills up\r\nto the suburb of the citadel; and then, at a given signal, all at once\r\nput the scaling ladders to the walls and began attempting the town.\r\nThe king was the first to take the suburb of the acropolis, which had\r\nbeen abandoned by the garrison; and when this was set on fire, those\r\nwho were defending the town walls, foreseeing what must happen, and\r\nafraid that by the fall of the citadel they would be deprived of their\r\nlast hope, abandoned the town walls, and fled into it: whereupon the\r\nMacedonians at once took the walls and the town. Subsequently the\r\ngarrison on the citadel sent an embassy to Philip, who granted them\r\ntheir lives, and received possession of it also by formal surrender.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Typanae and Phigalia surrender to Philip.]\r\n\r\n+79.+ These achievements of the king alarmed the whole people of\r\nTriphylia, and made them take counsel severally for the safety of\r\nthemselves and their respective cities: while Phillidas left Typaneae,\r\nafter plundering some of the houses there, and retired to Lepreum.\r\nThis was the reward which the allies of the Aetolians at that time\r\nusually got: not only to be deserted at the hour of utmost need in the\r\nmost barefaced way, but, by being plundered as well as betrayed, to\r\nsuffer at the hands of their allies exactly what they had a right to\r\nexpect from a victorious enemy. But the people of Typaneae surrendered\r\ntheir city to Philip; as also did the inhabitants of Hypana. And the\r\npeople of Phigalia, hearing of what had taken place in Triphylia, and\r\ndisliking the alliance with the Aetolians, rose in arms and seized\r\nthe space round the Polemarchium.[242] The Aetolian pirates who were\r\nresiding in this city, for the purpose of plundering Messene, were\r\nable at first to keep down and overawe the people; but when they saw\r\nthat the whole town was mustering to the rescue, they desisted from\r\nthe attempt. Having made terms with them, they took their baggage\r\nand evacuated the town; whereupon the inhabitants sent an embassy to\r\nPhilip, and delivered themselves and their town into his hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lepreum.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samicum,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and other towns.]\r\n\r\n+80.+ While these things were going on, the people of Lepreum, having\r\nseized a certain quarter of their town, demanded that the Elean,\r\nAetolian, and Lacedaemonian garrisons (for a reinforcement had come\r\nfrom Sparta also) should all alike evacuate the citadel and city.\r\nAt first Phillidas refused, and stayed on, hoping to overawe the\r\ncitizens; but when the king, despatching Taurion with a guard of\r\nsoldiers to Phigalia, advanced in person towards Lepreum, and was\r\nnow close to the town, Phillidas lowered his tone, and the Lepreates\r\nwere encouraged in their determination. It was indeed a glorious act\r\nof gallantry on their part. Though there was a garrison within their\r\nwalls of a thousand Eleans, a thousand Aetolians with the pirates,\r\nfive hundred mercenaries, and two hundred Lacedaemonians, and though\r\ntoo their citadel was in the occupation of these troops, yet they\r\nventured to make a stand for the freedom of their native city, and\r\nwould not give up hope of deliverance. Phillidas therefore, seeing\r\nthat the Lepreates were prepared to offer a stout resistance, and that\r\nthe Macedonians were approaching, evacuated the town with the Eleans\r\nand Lacedaemonians. The Cretans, who had been sent by the Spartans,\r\nmade their way home through Messenia; but Phillidas departed for\r\nSamicum. The people of Lepreum, having thus got control of their own\r\ntown, sent ambassadors to place it in the power of Philip. Hearing the\r\nnews, Philip sent all his army, except the peltasts and light-armed\r\ntroops, to Lepreum; and taking the latter with him, he made all the\r\nhaste he could to catch Phillidas. He succeeded so far as to capture\r\nall his baggage; but Phillidas himself managed to outstrip him and\r\nthrow himself into Samicum. The king therefore sat down before this\r\nplace: and having sent for the rest of his army from Lepreum, made the\r\ngarrison believe that he meant to besiege the town. But the Aetolians\r\nand Eleans within it, having nothing ready for sustaining a siege\r\nbeyond their bare hands, alarmed at their situation, held a parley\r\nwith Philip to secure their lives; and having obtained leave from\r\nhim to march out with their arms, they departed into Elis. Thus the\r\nking became master of Samicum on the spot: and this was followed by\r\ndeputations from other towns to him, with entreaties for protection;\r\nin virtue of which he took over Phrixa, Stylangium, Aepium, Bolax,\r\nPyrgos, and Epitalium. Having settled these things, and reduced all\r\nTriphylia into his power in six days, he returned to Lepreum; and\r\nhaving addressed the necessary warnings to the Lepreates, and put a\r\ngarrison into the citadel, he departed with his army towards Heraea,\r\nleaving Ladicus of Acarnania in command of Triphylia. When he arrived\r\nat Heraea, he made a distribution of all the booty; and taking up again\r\nhis baggage from Heraea, arrived about the middle of the winter at\r\nMegalopolis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chilon tries to seize the crown of Sparta, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n+81.+ While Philip was thus engaged in Triphylia, Chilon the\r\nLacedaemonian, holding that the kingship belonged to him in virtue\r\nof birth, and annoyed at the neglect of his claims by the Ephors in\r\nselecting Lycurgus, determined to stir up a revolution: and believing\r\nthat if he took the same course as Cleomenes had done, and gave the\r\ncommon people hopes of land allotments and redivision of property,\r\nthe masses would quickly follow him, he addressed himself to carrying\r\nout this policy. Having therefore agreed with his friends on this\r\nsubject, and got as many as two hundred people to join his conspiracy,\r\nhe entered upon the execution of his project. But perceiving that the\r\nchief obstacles in the way of the accomplishment of his design were\r\nLycurgus, and those Ephors who had invested him with the crown, he\r\ndirected his first efforts against them. The Ephors he seized while at\r\ndinner, and put them all to death on the spot,—chance thus inflicting\r\nupon them the punishment they deserved: for whether we regard the\r\nperson at whose hands, or the person for whose sake they were thus\r\ndestroyed, we cannot but say that they richly merited their fate.\r\n\r\nAfter the successful accomplishment of this deed, Chilon went to the\r\nhouse of Lycurgus, whom he found at home, but failed to seize. Assisted\r\nby slaves and neighbours Lycurgus was smuggled out of the house, and\r\neffected a secret escape; and thence got away by a cross-country route\r\nto the town of Pellene in Tripolis. Thus baffled in the most important\r\npoint of his enterprise, Chilon was greatly discouraged; but was forced\r\nall the same to go on with what he had begun. Accordingly he made\r\na descent upon the market-place, and laid violent hands upon those\r\nopposed to him; tried to rouse his relations and friends; and declared\r\nto the rest of the people there what hopes of success he had. But when\r\nnobody seemed inclined to join him, but on the contrary a mob began to\r\ncollect with threatening looks, he saw how it was, and found a secret\r\nway of leaving the town; and, making his way across Laconia, arrived\r\nin Achaia alone and an exile. But the Lacedaemonians who were in the\r\nterritory of Megalopolis, terrified by the arrival of Philip, stowed\r\naway all the goods they had got from the country, and first demolished\r\nand then abandoned the Athenaeum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of Sparta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 800(?)-B.C. 371.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 236-222.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Lacedaemonians enjoyed a most excellent\r\nconstitution, and had a most extensive power, from the time of the\r\nlegislation of Lycurgus to that of the battle of Leuctra. But after\r\nthat event their fortune took an unfavourable turn; and their political\r\nstate continued ever growing worse and worse, until they finally\r\nsuffered from a long succession of internal struggles and partisan\r\nwarfare; were repeatedly agitated by schemes for the redivision of\r\nlands and the banishment of one party or another; and were subjected to\r\nthe severest possible slavery, culminating in the tyrannical government\r\nof Nabis: though the word “tyrant” was one which they had in old times\r\nscarcely endured to hear mentioned. However, the ancient history of\r\nSparta as well as the great part of it since, has been recorded by\r\nmany in terms of eulogy or the reverse; but the part of that history\r\nwhich admits of the least controversy is that which followed the entire\r\ndestruction of the ancient constitution by Cleomenes;[243] and that\r\nshall be narrated by me in the order of events as they occur.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apelles opposes Aratus, Jan.-May, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: May, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Eperatus as Achaean Strategus.]\r\n\r\n+82.+ Meanwhile Philip left Megalopolis, and marching by way of Tegea\r\narrived at Argos, and there spent the rest of the winter, having gained\r\nin this campaign an admiration beyond his years for his general conduct\r\nand his brilliant achievements. But, in spite of all that had happened,\r\nApelles was by no means inclined to desist from the policy on which he\r\nhad entered; but was resolved little by little to bring the Achaeans\r\nunder the yoke. He saw that the most determined opponents of his\r\nscheme were the elder and younger Aratus; and that Philip was inclined\r\nto listen to them, and especially to the elder, both on account of\r\nhis former intimacy with Antigonus, and his pre-eminent influence in\r\nAchaia, and, most of all, because of his readiness of resource and\r\npractical ability: he therefore determined to devote his attention to\r\nthem, and enter upon the intrigue against them which I shall proceed to\r\ndescribe. He sought out in the several cities all such as were opposed\r\nto Aratus, and invited them to visit him: and having got them into his\r\nhands he tried all he could to win their affections, encouraged them to\r\nlook upon him as a friend, and introduced them to Philip. To the king\r\nhe was always pointing out that, if he listened to Aratus, he would\r\nhave to treat the Achaeans according to the letter of the treaty of\r\nalliance; but that, if he would listen to him, and take men like those\r\nwhich he had introduced to him into favour, he would have the whole of\r\nthe Peloponnese at his own unfettered disposal. But what he was most\r\nanxious about was the election; being desirous to secure the office\r\nof Strategus for one of this party, and to oust Aratus in accordance\r\nwith his settled plan. With this purpose, he persuaded Philip to be at\r\nAegium at the time of the Achaean election, on the pretext of being on\r\nhis way to Elis. The king’s consent to this enabled Apelles himself\r\nto be there at the right time; and though he found great difficulty,\r\nin spite of entreaties and threats, in carrying his point; yet he did\r\neventually succeed in getting Eperatus of Pharae elected Strategus, and\r\nTimoxenus, the candidate proposed by Aratus, rejected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of the Wall, and expedition into Elis.]\r\n\r\n+83.+ This over, the king departed by way of Patrae and Dyme, and\r\narrived with his army before the fortress called the Wall, which is\r\nsituated on the frontier of the territory of Dyme, and had a short\r\ntime before, as I mentioned above,[244] been occupied by Euripidas.\r\nThe king, being anxious at all hazards to recover this place for the\r\nDymaeans, encamped under its walls with his full force: and thereupon\r\nthe Elean garrison in alarm surrendered the place to Philip, which,\r\nthough not large, had been fortified with extraordinary care. For\r\nthough the circumference of its walls was not more than a stade and a\r\nhalf, its height was nowhere less than thirty cubits. Having handed the\r\nplace over to the Dymaeans, Philip continued his advance, plundering\r\nthe territory of Elis: and when he had thoroughly devastated it, and\r\nacquired a large booty, he returned with his army to Dyme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The intrigue of Apelles.]\r\n\r\n+84.+ Meanwhile Apelles, thinking that, by the election of the Achaean\r\nStrategus through his influence, he had partly succeeded in his policy,\r\nbegan once more attacking Aratus, with the view of entirely detaching\r\nPhilip from his friendship: and he accordingly determined to make up\r\nan accusation against him grounded on the following circumstance: When\r\nAmphidamus, the Elean Strategus, had been, with the other refugees,\r\nmade prisoner at Thalamae, and had been brought among other captives to\r\nOlympia, he made earnest efforts by the agency of certain individuals\r\nto be allowed an interview with the king. This favour having been\r\naccorded him, he made a statement to the effect that it was in his\r\npower to bring over the Eleans to the king’s side, and induce them to\r\nenter into alliance with him. Philip believed him; and accordingly\r\ndismissed Amphidamus without ransom, with instructions to promise the\r\nEleans, that, if they would join the king, he would restore their\r\ncaptive citizens without ransom, and would himself secure their\r\nterritory safely from all outside attacks: and besides this would\r\nmaintain them in freedom, without impost or foreign garrison, and in\r\nenjoyment of their several constitutions.\r\n\r\nBut the Eleans refused to listen to the proposal, although the offer\r\nwas thought attractive and substantial. Apelles therefore used this\r\ncircumstance to found the false accusation which he now brought before\r\nPhilip, alleging that Aratus was not a loyal friend to the Macedonians,\r\nnor sincere in his feelings towards them: “He was responsible for this\r\nalienation of the Eleans; for when the king despatched Amphidamus from\r\nOlympia into Elis, Aratus took him aside and talked to him, asserting\r\nthat it was by no means to the interest of the Peloponnesians that\r\nPhilip should become supreme in Elis: and this was the reason of the\r\nEleans despising the king’s offers, and clinging to the friendship of\r\nthe Aetolians, and persisting in war against the Macedonians.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king investigates the charge against Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+85.+ Regarding the matter as important, the first step the king took\r\nwas to summon the elder and younger Aratus, and order Apelles to repeat\r\nthese assertions in their presence: which he thereupon did in a bold\r\nand threatening tone. And upon the king still not saying a word, he\r\nadded: “Since his Majesty finds you, Aratus, so ungrateful and so\r\nexceedingly adverse to his interests, he is determined to summon a\r\nmeeting of the Achaeans, and, after making a statement of his reasons,\r\nforthwith to return to Macedonia.” Aratus the elder answered him with a\r\ngeneral exhortation to Philip, never to give a hasty or inconsiderate\r\ncredit to any thing which might be alleged before him against his\r\nfriends and allies: but when any such allegation were made, to test\r\nits truth before accepting it; for that was the conduct which became\r\na king, and was in every way to his interest. Wherefore he said, “I\r\nclaim that you should, in the present instance of these accusations of\r\nApelles, summon those who heard my words; and openly produce the man\r\nthat informed Apelles of them, and omit no means of ascertaining the\r\nreal truth, before making any statement in regard to these matters to\r\nthe Achaeans.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus is cleared.]\r\n\r\n+86.+ The king approved of this speech, and said that he would not\r\nneglect the matter, but would thoroughly investigate it. And so for\r\nthe present the audience was dissolved. But during the following days,\r\nwhile Apelles failed to bring any proof of his allegations, Aratus was\r\nfavoured by the following combination of circumstances. While Philip\r\nwas laying waste their territory, the Eleans, suspecting Amphidamus of\r\ntreachery, determined to arrest him and send him in chains to Aetolia.\r\nBut getting intelligence of their purpose, he escaped first to Olympia;\r\nand there, hearing that Philip was at Dyme engaged in the division\r\nof his spoils, he followed him to that town in great haste. When\r\nAratus heard that Amphidamus had been driven from Elis and was come to\r\nDyme, he was delighted, because his conscience was quite clear in the\r\nmatter; and going to the king demanded that he should summon Amphidamus\r\nto his presence; on the ground that the man to whom the words were\r\nalleged to have been spoken would best know about the accusations,\r\nand would declare the truth; for he had become an exile from his home\r\nfrom Philip’s sake, and had now no hope of safety except in him.\r\nThese arguments satisfied the king, who thereupon sent for Amphidamus\r\nand ascertained that the accusation was false. The result was that\r\nfrom that day forward his liking and respect for Aratus continually\r\nincreased, while he began to regard Apelles with suspicion; though\r\nbeing still under the influence of his old ascendency, he was compelled\r\nto connive at many of his actions.\r\n\r\n+87.+ Apelles however by no means abandoned his policy. He began\r\nundermining the position of Taurion also, who had been placed in\r\ncommand of the Peloponnese by Antigonus, not indeed openly attacking\r\nhim, but rather praising his character, and asserting that he was a\r\nproper person to be with the king on a campaign; his object being\r\nto get some one else appointed to conduct the government of the\r\nPeloponnese. This was indeed a novel method of defamation,—to damage\r\none’s neighbours, not by attacking, but by praising their characters;\r\nand this method of wreaking one’s malice, envy, and treachery may be\r\nregarded as primarily and specially the invention of the jealousy and\r\nselfish ambition of courtiers. In the same spirit he began making\r\ncovert attacks upon Alexander, the captain of the bodyguard, whenever\r\nhe got an opportunity; being bent on reconstituting by his own\r\nauthority even the personal attendants of the king, and on making a\r\nclean sweep of all arrangements left existing by Antigonus. For as in\r\nhis life Antigonus had managed his kingdom and his son with wisdom, so\r\nat his death he made wise provisions for every department of the State.\r\nFor in his will he explained to the Macedonians the nature of these\r\narrangements; and also gave definite instructions for the future, how\r\nand by whom each of these arrangements was to be carried out: being\r\ndesirous of leaving no vantage-ground to the courtiers for mutual\r\nrivalry and strife. Among these arrangements was one selecting Apelles\r\nfrom among his companions in arms to be one of the guardians of his\r\nson; Leontius to command the peltasts; Megaleas to be chief secretary;\r\nTaurion to be governor of the Peloponnese; and Alexander to be captain\r\nof the bodyguard. Apelles had already got Leontius and Megaleas\r\ncompletely under his influence: and he was now desirous to remove\r\nAlexander and Taurion from their offices, and so to control these, as\r\nwell as all other departments of the government, by the agency of his\r\nown friends. And he would have easily succeeded in doing so, had he not\r\nraised up an opponent in the person of Aratus. As it was, he quickly\r\nreaped the fruits of his own blind selfishness and ambition; for\r\nthat which he purposed inflicting on his neighbours he had to endure\r\nhimself, and that within a very brief space. How and by what means this\r\nwas brought about, I must forbear to tell for the present, and must\r\nbring this book to an end: but in subsequent parts of my work I will\r\nendeavour to make every detail of these transactions clear.\r\n\r\nFor the present, after concluding the business which I have described,\r\nPhilip returned to Argos, and there spent the rest of the winter season\r\nwith his friends, while he sent back his forces to Macedonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: May, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n+1.+ The year of office as Strategus of the younger Aratus had now\r\ncome to an end with the rising of the Pleiades; for that was the\r\narrangement of time then observed by the Achaeans.[245] Accordingly he\r\nlaid down his office and was succeeded in the command of the Achaeans\r\nby Eperatus; Dorimachus being still Strategus of the Aetolians.\r\n\r\nIt was at the beginning of this summer that Hannibal entered upon\r\nopen war with Rome; started from New Carthage; and crossing the Iber,\r\ndefinitely began his expedition and march into Italy; while the Romans\r\ndespatched Tiberius Sempronius to Libya with an army, and Publius\r\nCornelius to Iberia.\r\n\r\nThis year, too, Antiochus and Ptolemy, abandoning diplomacy, and the\r\nsupport of their mutual claims upon Coele-Syria by negotiation, began\r\nactual war with each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recognition of Philip’s services by the assembly of the\r\nAchaean league.]\r\n\r\nAs for Philip, being in need of corn and money for his army, he\r\nsummoned the Achaeans to a general assembly by means of their\r\nmagistrates. When the assembly had met, according to the federal law,\r\nat Aegium,[246] the king saw that Aratus and his son were indisposed\r\nto act for him, because of the intrigues against them in the matter of\r\nthe election, which had been carried on by Apelles; and that Eperatus\r\nwas naturally inefficient, and an object of general contempt. These\r\nfacts convinced the king of the folly of Apelles and Leontius, and\r\nhe once more decided to stand by Aratus. He therefore persuaded the\r\nmagistrates to transfer the assembly to Sicyon; and there inviting both\r\nthe elder and younger Aratus to an interview, he laid the blame of\r\nall that had happened upon Apelles, and urged them to maintain their\r\noriginal policy. Receiving a ready consent from them, he then entered\r\nthe Achaean assembly, and being energetically supported by these two\r\nstatesmen, earned all the measures that he desired. For the Achaeans\r\npassed a vote decreeing “that five hundred talents should be paid to\r\nthe king at once for his last campaign, that three months’ pay should\r\nbe given to his army, and ten thousand medimni of corn; and that, for\r\nthe future, so long as the king should remain in the Peloponnese as\r\ntheir ally in the war, he should receive seventeen talents a month from\r\nthe Achaeans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king prepares to carry on the war by sea.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ Having passed this decree, the Achaeans dispersed to their various\r\ncities. And now the king’s forces mustered again from their winter\r\nquarters; and after deliberations with his friends, Philip decided to\r\ntransfer the war to the sea. For he had become convinced that it was\r\nonly by so doing that he would himself be able to surprise the enemy\r\nat all points at once, and would best deprive them of the opportunity\r\nof coming to each others' relief; as they were widely scattered, and\r\neach would be in alarm for their own safety, because the approach of\r\nan enemy by sea is so silent and rapid. For he was at war with three\r\nseparate nations,—Aetolians, Lacedaemonians, and Eleans.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this decision, he ordered the ships of the Achaeans\r\nas well as his own to muster at Lechaeum; and there he made continual\r\nexperiments in practising the soldiers of the phalanx to the use of\r\nthe oar. The Macedonians answered to his instructions with ready\r\nenthusiasm: for they are in fact the most gallant soldiers on the field\r\nof battle, the promptest to undertake service at sea if need be, and\r\nthe most laborious workers at digging trenches, making palisades, and\r\nall such engineering work, in the world: just such as Hesiod describes\r\nthe Aeacidae to be\r\n\r\n   “Joying in war as in a feast.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fresh intrigue of Apelles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip starts on his naval expedition, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\nThe king, then, and the main body of the Macedonian army, remained in\r\nCorinth, busied with these practisings and preparations for taking\r\nthe sea. But Apelles, being neither able to retain an ascendency over\r\nPhilip, nor to submit to the loss of influence which resulted from\r\nthis disregard, entered into a conspiracy with Leontius and Megaleas,\r\nby which it was agreed that these two men should stay on the spot and\r\ndamage the king’s service by deliberate neglect; while he went to\r\nChalcis, and contrived that no supplies should be brought the king from\r\nthence for the promotion of his designs. Having made this arrangement\r\nand mischievous stipulation with these two men, Apelles set out for\r\nChalcis, having found some false pretexts to satisfy the king as to\r\nhis departure. And while protracting his stay there, he carried out\r\nhis sworn agreement with such determination, that, as all men obeyed\r\nhim because of this former credit, the king was at last reduced by\r\nwant of money to pawn some of the silver-plate used at his own table,\r\nto carry on his affairs. However, when the ships were all collected,\r\nand the Macedonian soldiers already well trained to the oar; the king,\r\ngiving out rations of corn and pay to the army, put to sea, and arrived\r\nat Patrae on the second day, with six thousand Macedonians and twelve\r\nhundred mercenaries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The siege of Palus.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ Just at that time the Aetolian Strategus Dorimachus sent Agelaus\r\nand Scopas with five hundred Neo-Cretans[247] into Elis; while the\r\nEleans, in fear of Philip’s attempting the siege of Cyllene, were\r\ncollecting mercenaries, preparing their own citizens, and carefully\r\nstrengthening the defences of Cyllene. When Philip saw what was\r\ngoing on, he stationed a force at Dyme, consisting of the Achaean\r\nmercenaries, some of the Cretans serving with him, and some of the\r\nGallic horse, together with two thousand picked Achaean infantry.\r\nThese he left there as a reserve, as well as an advance guard to\r\nprevent the danger of an attack from Elis; while he himself, having\r\nfirst written to the Acarnanians and Scerdilaidas, that each of their\r\ntowns should man such vessels as they had and meet him at Cephallenia,\r\nput to sea from Patrae at the time arranged, and arrived off Pronni\r\nin Cephallenia. But when he saw that this fortress was difficult to\r\nbesiege, and its position a contracted one, he coasted past it with\r\nhis fleet and came to anchor at Palus. Finding that the country there\r\nwas full of corn and capable of supporting an army, he disembarked\r\nhis troops and encamped close to the city: and having beached his\r\nships close together, secured them with a trench and palisade, and\r\nsent out his Macedonian soldiers to forage. He himself made a personal\r\ninspection of the town, to see how he could bring his siege-works and\r\nartillery to bear upon the wall. He wished to be able to use the place\r\nas a rendezvous for his allies; but he was also desirous of taking it:\r\nfirst, because he would thereby deprive the Aetolians of their most\r\nuseful support,—for it was by means of Cephallenian ships that they\r\nmade their descents upon the Peloponnese, and ravaged the seaboards of\r\nEpirus and Acarnania,—and, secondly, that he might secure for himself\r\nand his allies a convenient base of operations against the enemy’s\r\nterritory. For Cephallenia lies exactly opposite the Corinthian Gulf,\r\nin the direction of the Sicilian Sea, and commands the north-western\r\ndistrict of the Peloponnese, and especially Elis; as well as the\r\nsouth-western parts of Epirus, Aetolia, and Acarnania.\r\n\r\n+4.+ The excellent position, therefore, of the island, both as a\r\nrendezvous for the allies and as a base of attack against the hostile,\r\nor of defence for the friendly, territory, made the king very anxious\r\nto get it into his power. His survey of the town showed him that it\r\nwas entirely defended by the sea and steep hills, except for a short\r\ndistance in the direction of Zacynthus, where the ground was flat; and\r\nhe accordingly resolved to erect his works and concentrate his attack\r\nat that spot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival of the allies at Palus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The walls are undermined and a breach made. Leontius plays\r\nthe traitor.]\r\n\r\nWhile the king was engaged in these operations fifty galleys arrived\r\nfrom Scerdilaidas, who had been prevented from sending more by the\r\nplots and civil broils throughout Illyria, caused by the despots of\r\nthe various cities. There arrived also the appointed contingents of\r\nallies from Epirus, Acarnania, and even Messenia; for the Messenians\r\nhad ceased to excuse themselves from taking part in the war ever since\r\nthe capture of Phigalia. Having now made his arrangements for the\r\nsiege, and having got his catapults and ballistae in position to annoy\r\nthe defenders on the walls, the king harangued his Macedonian troops,\r\nand, bringing his siege-machines up to the walls, began under their\r\nprotection to sink mines. The Macedonians worked with such enthusiastic\r\neagerness that in a short time two hundred feet of the wall were\r\nundermined and underpinned: and the king then approached the walls and\r\ninvited the citizens to come to terms. Upon their refusal, he set fire\r\nto the props, and thus brought down the whole part of the wall that\r\nrested upon them simultaneously. Into this breach he first sent his\r\npeltasts under the command of Leontius, divided into cohorts, and with\r\norders to force their way over the ruin. But Leontius, in fulfilment of\r\nhis compact with Apelles, three times running prevented the soldiers,\r\neven after they had carried the breach, from effecting the capture of\r\nthe town. He had corrupted beforehand the most important officers of\r\nthe several cohorts; and he himself deliberately affected fear, and\r\nshrunk from every service of danger; and finally they were ejected from\r\nthe town with considerable loss, although they could have mastered the\r\nenemy with ease. When the king saw that the officers were behaving with\r\ncowardice, and that a considerable number of the Macedonian soldiers\r\nwere wounded, he abandoned the siege, and deliberated with his friends\r\non the next step to be taken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ambassadors from Acarnania urge Philip to invade Aetolia;\r\nothers from Messenia beg him to come there.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip decides on the invasion of Aetolia.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ Meanwhile Lycurgus had invaded Messenia; and Dorimachus had\r\nstarted for Thessaly with half the Aetolian army,—both with the\r\nidea that they would thus draw off Philip from the siege of Palus.\r\nPresently ambassadors arrived at the court to make representations on\r\nthese subjects from Acarnania and Messenia: the former urging Philip\r\nto prevent Dorimachus’s invasion of Macedonia by himself invading\r\nAetolia, and traversing and plundering the whole country while there\r\nwas no one to resist him; the latter begged him to come to their\r\nassistance, representing that in the existing state of the Etesian\r\nwinds the passage from Cephallenia to Messenia could be effected\r\nin a single day, whereby, so Gorgus of Messenia and his colleagues\r\nargued, a sudden and effective attack would be made upon Lycurgus.\r\nIn pursuance of his policy Leontius eagerly supported Gorgus, seeing\r\nthat by this means Philip would absolutely waste the summer. For it\r\nwas easy enough to sail to Messenia; but to sail back again, while\r\nthe Etesian winds prevailed, was impossible. It was plain therefore\r\nthat Philip would get shut up in Messenia with his army, and remain\r\ninactive for what remained of the summer; while the Aetolians would\r\ntraverse Thessaly and Epirus and plunder them at their pleasure. Such\r\nwas the insidious nature of the advice given by Gorgus and Leontius.\r\nBut Aratus, who was present, advocated an exactly opposite policy,\r\nurging the king to sail to Aetolia and devote himself to that part of\r\nthe campaign: for as the Aetolians had gone on an expedition across\r\nthe frontier under Dorimachus, it was a most excellent opportunity\r\nfor invading and plundering Aetolia. The king had begun to entertain\r\ndistrust of Leontius since his exhibition of cowardice in the siege;\r\nand had detected his dishonesty in the course of the discussions held\r\nabout Palus: he therefore decided to act in the present instance in\r\naccordance with the opinion of Aratus. Accordingly he wrote to the\r\nAchaean Strategus Eperatus, bidding him take the Achaean levies, and\r\ngo to the aid of the Messenians; while he himself put to sea from\r\nCephallenia, and arrived at night after a two days’ voyage at Leucas:\r\nand having managed by proper contrivances to get his ships through the\r\nchannel of Dioryctus,[248] he sailed up the Ambracian Gulf, which, as\r\nI have already stated,[249] stretches from the Sicilian Sea a long\r\ndistance into the interior of Aetolia. Having made the whole length of\r\nthis gulf, and anchored a short time before daybreak at Limnaea, he\r\nordered his men to get their breakfast, and leaving the greater part of\r\ntheir baggage behind them, to make themselves ready in light equipment\r\nfor a march; while he himself collected the guides, and made careful\r\ninquiries of them about the country and neighbouring towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip is joined by the Acarnanians, and marches to the\r\nAchelous.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ Before they started, Aristophanes the Acarnanian Strategus arrived\r\nwith the full levy of his people. For having in former times suffered\r\nmany severe injuries at the hands of the Aetolians, they were now\r\ninspired with a fierce determination to be revenged upon them and\r\ndamage them in every possible way: they gladly therefore seized this\r\nopportunity of getting the help of the Macedonians; and the men who now\r\nappeared in arms were not confined to those forced by law to serve, but\r\nwere in some cases past the military age. The Epirotes were quite as\r\neager to join, and for the same motives; but owing to the wide extent\r\nof their country, and the suddenness of the Macedonian arrival, they\r\nhad not been able to muster their forces in time. As to the Aetolians,\r\nDorimachus had taken half their army with him, as I have said, while\r\nthe the other half he had left at home, thinking that it would be an\r\nadequate reserve to defend the towns and district against unforeseen\r\ncontingencies. The king, leaving a sufficient guard for his baggage,\r\nstarted from Limnaea in the evening, and after a march of sixty stades\r\npitched his camp: but, having dined and given his men a short rest,\r\nhe started again; and marching right through the night, arrived just\r\nas the day was breaking at the river Achelous, between the towns of\r\nStratus and Conope, being anxious that his entrance into the district\r\nof Thermus should be sudden and unexpected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leontius tries to hinder the march.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ Leontius saw that it was likely that the king would attain his\r\nobject, and the Aetolians be unable to resist him, for the double\r\nreason of the speed and unexpectedness of the Macedonian attack, and\r\nof his having gone to Thermus; for the Aetolians would never suppose\r\nhim likely to venture to expose himself so rashly, seeing the strongly\r\nfortified nature of the country, and would therefore be sure to be\r\ncaught off their guard and wholly unprepared for the danger. Clinging\r\nstill to his purpose, therefore, he advised the king to encamp on the\r\nAchelous, and rest his army after their night’s march; being anxious\r\nto give the Aetolians a short respite to make preparations for their\r\ndefence. But Aratus, seeing clearly that the opportunity for action was\r\nfleeting, and that Leontius was plainly trying to hinder their success,\r\nconjured Philip not to let slip the opportunity by delaying.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king crosses the Achelous and advances against Thermus.]\r\n\r\nThe king was now thoroughly annoyed with Leontius: and accepting the\r\nadvice of Aratus, continued his march without interruption; and, after\r\ncrossing the Achelous, advanced rapidly upon Thermus, plundering and\r\ndevastating the country as he went, and marching so as to keep Stratus,\r\nAgrinium, and Thestia on his left, Conope, Lysimachia, Trichonium, and\r\nPhytaeum on his right. Arrived at the town of Metapa, which is on the\r\nborders of the Trichonian Lake, and close to the narrow pass along\r\nit, about sixty stades from Thermus, he found it abandoned by the\r\nAetolians, and occupied it with a detachment of five hundred men, with\r\na view of its serving as a fortress to secure both ends of the pass:\r\nfor the whole shore of the lake is mountainous and rugged, closely\r\nfringed with forest, and therefore affording but a narrow and difficult\r\npath. He now arranged his order of march, putting the mercenaries in\r\nthe van, next them the Illyrians, and then the peltasts and the men of\r\nthe phalanx, and thus advanced through the pass; his rear protected\r\nby the Cretans: while the Thracians and light-armed troops took a\r\ndifferent line of country, parallel to his own, and kept up with him on\r\nhis right: his left being secured by the lake for nearly thirty stades.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The plundering of Thermus.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ At the end of this distance he arrived at the village of Pamphia;\r\nand having, as in the case of Panapa, secured it by a guard, he\r\ncontinued his advance towards Thermus: the road now being not only\r\nsteep and exceedingly rough, but with deep precipices also on either\r\nside, so as to make the path in places very dangerous and narrow; and\r\nthe whole ascent being nearly thirty stades. But having accomplished\r\nthis also in a short time, thanks to the energy with which the\r\nMacedonians conducted the march, he arrived late in the day at Thermus.\r\nThere he pitched a camp, and allowed his men to go off plundering the\r\nneighbouring villages and scouring the plain of Thermus, as well as\r\nto sack the dwelling-houses in Thermus itself, which were full, not\r\nonly of corn and such like provisions, but of all the most valuable\r\nproperty which the Aetolians possessed. For as the annual fair and most\r\nfamous games, as well as the elections, were held there, everybody\r\nkept their most costly possessions in store at Thermus, to enable\r\nthem to entertain their friends, and to celebrate the festivals with\r\nproper magnificence. But besides this occasion for the employment\r\nof their property, they expected to find the most complete security\r\nfor it there, because no enemy had ever yet ventured to penetrate to\r\nthat place; while its natural strength was so great as to serve as an\r\nacropolis to the whole of Aetolia. The place therefore having been\r\nin the enjoyment of peace from time immemorial, not only were the\r\nbuildings immediately round the temple filled with a great variety of\r\nproperty, but the homesteads on the outskirts also. For that night the\r\narmy bivouacked on the spot laden with booty of every description; but\r\nthe next morning they selected the most valuable and portable part of\r\nit, and making the rest into a heap in front of their tents, set fire\r\nto it. So also in regard to the dedicated arms which were hanging up\r\nin the porticoes,—those of them which were valuable they took down and\r\ncarried off, some they exchanged for their own, while the rest they\r\ncollected together and burnt. The number of these was more than fifteen\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sacrilege committed at Thermus. Was it justifiable?]\r\n\r\n+9.+ Up to this point everything was right and fair by the laws of\r\nwar; but I do not know how to characterise their next proceedings. For\r\nremembering what the Aetolians had done at Dium[250] and Dodona,[251]\r\nthey burnt the colonnades, and destroyed what were left of the\r\ndedicated offerings, some of which were of costly material, and had\r\nbeen elaborated with great skill and expense. And they were not\r\ncontent with destroying the roofs of these buildings with fire, they\r\nlevelled them to their foundations; and threw down all the statues,\r\nwhich numbered no less than two thousand; and many of them they broke\r\nto pieces, sparing only those that were inscribed with the names or\r\nfigures of gods. Such they did abstain from injuring. On the walls\r\nalso they wrote the celebrated line composed by Samus, the son of\r\nChrysogonus, a foster-brother of the king, whose genius was then\r\nbeginning to manifest itself. The line was this—\r\n\r\n   “Seest thou the path the bolt divine has sped?”\r\n\r\nAnd in fact the king and his staff were fully convinced that, in\r\nthus acting, they were obeying the dictates of right and justice,\r\nby retaliating upon the Aetolians with the same impious outrages as\r\nthey had themselves committed at Dium.[252] But I am clearly of an\r\nopposite opinion. And the readiest argument, to prove the correctness\r\nof my view, may be drawn from the history of this same royal family of\r\nMacedonia.\r\n\r\nFor when Antigonus, by his victory in a pitched battle over Cleomenes\r\nthe King of the Lacedaemonians, had become master of Sparta, and had\r\nit absolutely in his own power to treat the town and its citizens as\r\nhe chose, he was so far from doing any injury to those who had thus\r\nfallen into his hands, that he did not return to his own country until\r\nhe had bestowed upon the Lacedaemonians, collectively and individually,\r\nsome benefits of the utmost importance. The consequence was that he\r\nwas honoured at the time with the title of “Benefactor,” and after his\r\ndeath with that of “Preserver”; and not only among the Lacedaemonians,\r\nbut among the Greeks generally, has obtained undying honour and\r\nglory.[253]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 338.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ Take again the case of Philip, the founder of the family\r\nsplendour, and the first of the race to establish the greatness of the\r\nkingdom. The success which he obtained, after his victory over the\r\nAthenians at Chaeronea, was not due so much to his superiority in arms,\r\nas to his justice and humanity. His victory in the field gave him the\r\nmastery only over those immediately engaged against him; while his\r\nequity and moderation secured his hold upon the entire Athenian people\r\nand their city. For he did not allow his measures to be dictated by\r\nvindictive passion; but laid aside his arms and warlike measures, as\r\nsoon as he found himself in a position to display the mildness of his\r\ntemper and the uprightness of his motives. With this view he dismissed\r\nhis Athenian prisoners without ransom, and took measures for the burial\r\nof those who had fallen, and, by the agency of Antipater, caused their\r\nbones to be conveyed home; and presented most of those whom he released\r\nwith suits of clothes. And thus, at small expense, his prudence gained\r\nhim a most important advantage. The pride of the Athenians was not\r\nproof against such magnanimity; and they became his zealous supporters,\r\ninstead of antagonists, in all his schemes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 335.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The subsequent decline in Philip’s character.]\r\n\r\nAgain in the case of Alexander the Great. He was so enraged with the\r\nThebans that he sold all the inhabitants of the town into slavery, and\r\nlevelled the city itself with the ground; yet in making its capture he\r\nwas careful not to outrage religion, and took the utmost precautions\r\nagainst even involuntary damage being done to the temples, or any part\r\nof their sacred enclosures. Once more, when he crossed into Asia, to\r\navenge on the Persians the impious outrages which they had inflicted\r\non the Greeks, he did his best to exact the full penalty from men,\r\nbut refrained from injuring places dedicated to the gods; though it\r\nwas in precisely such that the injuries of the Persians in Greece had\r\nbeen most conspicuous. These were the precedents which Philip should\r\nhave called to mind on this occasion; and so have shown himself the\r\nsuccessor and heir of these men,—not so much of their power, as of\r\ntheir principles and magnanimity. But throughout his life he was\r\nexceedingly anxious to establish his relationship to Alexander and\r\nPhilip, and yet took not the least pains to imitate them. The result\r\nwas that, as he advanced in years, as his conduct differed from theirs,\r\nso his general reputation came to be different also.\r\n\r\n+11.+ The present affair was an instance of this. He imagined\r\nthat he was doing nothing wrong in giving the rein to his anger,\r\nand retaliating upon the impious acts of the Aetolians by similar\r\nimpieties, and “curing ill by ill”; and while he was always reproaching\r\nScopas and Dorimachus with depravity and abandoned wickedness, on\r\nthe grounds of their acts of impiety at Dodona and Dium, he imagined\r\nthat, while emulating their crimes, he would leave quite a different\r\nimpression of his character in the minds of those to whom he spoke.\r\nBut the fact is, that whereas the taking and demolishing an enemy’s\r\nforts, harbours, cities, men, ships and crops, and other such things,\r\nby which our enemy is weakened, and our own interests and tactics\r\nsupported, are necessary acts according to the laws and rights of war;\r\nto deface temples, statues, and such like erections in pure wantonness,\r\nand without any prospect of strengthening oneself or weakening the\r\nenemy, must be regarded as an act of blind passion and insanity. For\r\nthe purpose with which good men wage war is not the destruction and\r\nannihilation of the wrongdoers, but the reformation and alteration of\r\nthe wrongful acts. Nor is it their object to involve the innocent in\r\nthe destruction of the guilty, but rather to see that those who are\r\nheld to be guilty should share in the preservation and elevation of\r\nthe guiltless. It is the act of a tyrant to inflict injury, and so to\r\nmaintain his power over unwilling subjects by terror,—hated, and hating\r\nthose under him: but it is the glory of a king to secure, by doing good\r\nto all, that he should rule over willing subjects, whose love he has\r\nearned by humanity and beneficence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The error of such sacrilege as a matter of policy.]\r\n\r\nBut the best way of appreciating the gravity of Philip’s mistake is\r\nto put before our eyes the idea which the Aetolians would probably\r\nhave conceived of him, had he acted in an opposite way, and destroyed\r\nneither colonnades nor statutes, nor done injury to any of the sacred\r\nofferings. For my part I think it would have been one of the greatest\r\ngoodness and humanity. For they would have had on their consciences\r\ntheir own acts at Dium and Dodona; and would have seen unmistakably\r\nthat, whereas Philip was absolutely master of the situation, and could\r\ndo what he chose, and would have been held fully justified as far as\r\ntheir deserts went in taking the severest measures, yet deliberately,\r\nfrom mere gentleness and magnanimity, he refused to copy their conduct\r\nin any respect.\r\n\r\n+12.+ Clearly these considerations would most probably have led them\r\nto condemn themselves, and to view Philip with respect and admiration\r\nfor his kingly and high minded qualities, shown by his respect for\r\nreligion and by the moderation of his anger against themselves. For in\r\ntruth to conquer one’s enemies in integrity and equity is not of less,\r\nbut of greater, practical advantage than victories in the field. In the\r\none case the defeated party yields under compulsion; in the other with\r\ncheerful assent. In the one case the victor effects his reformation at\r\nthe cost of great losses; in the other he recalls the erring to better\r\ncourses without any damage to himself. But above all, in the one case\r\nthe chief credit of the victory belongs to the soldiers, in the other\r\nit falls wholly and solely to the part of the leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The blame chiefly belongs to Demetrius of Pharos.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, one ought not to lay all the blame for what was\r\ndone on that occasion on Philip, taking his age into consideration;\r\nbut chiefly on his friends, who were in attendance upon him and\r\nco-operating with him, among whom were Aratus and Demetrius of Pharos.\r\nIn regard to them it would not be difficult to assert, even without\r\nbeing there, from which of the two a counsel of this sort proceeded.\r\nFor apart from the general principles animating the whole course of\r\nhis life, in which nothing savouring of rashness and want of judgment\r\ncan be alleged of Aratus, while the exact contrary may be said of\r\nDemetrius, we have an undisputed instance of the principles actuating\r\nboth the one and the other in analogous circumstances, on which I shall\r\nspeak in its proper place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The return of Philip from Thermus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Matape.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acrae.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stratus.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ To return then to Philip. Taking with him as much booty living\r\nand dead as he could, he started from Thermus, returning by the same\r\nroad as that by which he had come; putting the booty and heavy-armed\r\ninfantry in the van, and reserving the Acarnanians and mercenaries\r\nto bring up the rear. He was in great haste to get through the\r\ndifficult passes, because he expected that the Aetolians, relying\r\non the security of their strongholds, would harass his rear. And\r\nthis in fact promptly took place: for a body of Aetolians, that had\r\ncollected to the number of nearly three thousand for the defence of\r\nthe country, under the command of Alexander of Trichonium, hovered\r\nabout, concealing themselves in certain secret hiding-places, and not\r\nventuring to approach as long as Philip was on the high ground; but as\r\nsoon as he got his rear-guard in motion they promptly threw themselves\r\ninto Thermus and began harassing the hindermost of the enemy’s column.\r\nThe rear being thus thrown into confusion, the attacks and charges of\r\nthe Aetolians became more and more furious, encouraged by the nature\r\nof the ground. But Philip had foreseen this danger, and had provided\r\nfor it, by stationing his Illyrians and his best peltasts under cover\r\nof a certain hill on the descent. These men suddenly fell upon the\r\nadvanced bodies of the enemy as they were charging; whereupon the rest\r\nof the Aetolian army fled in headlong haste over a wild and trackless\r\ncountry, with a loss of a hundred and thirty killed, and about the\r\nsame number taken prisoners. This success relieved his rear; which,\r\nafter burning Pamphium, accomplished the passage of the narrow gorge\r\nwith rapidity and safety, and effected a junction with the Macedonians\r\nnear Matape, at which place Philip had pitched a camp and was waiting\r\nfor his rear-guard to come up. Next day, after levelling Metape to\r\nthe ground, he advanced to the city called Acrae; next day to Conope,\r\nravaging the country as he passed, and there encamped for the night.\r\nOn the next he marched along the Achelous as far as Stratus; there he\r\ncrossed the river, and, having halted his men out of range, endeavoured\r\nto tempt the garrison outside the walls; for he had been informed that\r\ntwo thousand Aetolian infantry and about four hundred horse, with five\r\nhundred Cretans, had collected into Stratus. But when no one ventured\r\nout, he renewed his march, and ordered his van to advance towards\r\nLimnaea and the ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip victorious in a skirmish with the garrison of\r\nStratus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival at Limnaea.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ But no sooner had his rear passed the town than, first, a small\r\nbody of Aetolian cavalry sallied out and began harassing the hindmost\r\nmen; and then, the whole of the Cretans and some Aetolian troops having\r\njoined their cavalry, the conflict became more severe, and the rear of\r\nPhilip’s army were forced to face about and engage the enemy. At first\r\nthe conflict was undecided; but on Philip’s mercenaries being supported\r\nby the arrival of the Illyrians, the Aetolian cavalry and mercenaries\r\ngave way and fled in disorder. The royal troops pursued most of them\r\nto the entrance of the gates, or up to the walls, and killed about a\r\nhundred of them. After this skirmish the garrison remained inactive,\r\nand the rear of the royal army reached the camp and the ships in safety.\r\n\r\nPhilip pitched his camp early in the day, and proceeded to make a thank\r\noffering to the gods for the successful issue of his undertaking; and\r\nto invite the officers to a banquet, at which it was his intention to\r\nentertain them all. His view was that he had ventured upon a dangerous\r\ncountry, and such as no one had ever ventured to enter with an army\r\nbefore; while he had not only entered it with an army, but had returned\r\nin safety, after accomplishing all that he had intended. But while he\r\nwas thus intent on entertaining his officers in great elation of mind,\r\nMegaleas and Leontius were nursing feelings of great annoyance at the\r\nsuccess of the king. They had arranged with Apelles to hamper all his\r\nplans, but had been unable to do so; and now saw everything turning out\r\nexactly contrary to their views.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Megaleas and Leontius betray their chagrin at the king’s\r\nsuccess.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They assault Aratus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Megaleas and Crinon held to bail.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ Still they came to the banquet, where they from the first excited\r\nthe suspicions of the king and the rest of the company, by showing\r\nless joy at the events than the others present. But as the drinking\r\nwent on, and grew less and less moderate, being forced to do just as\r\nthe others did, they soon showed themselves in their true colours.\r\nFor as soon as the company broke up, losing control over themselves\r\nunder the influence of wine, they roamed about looking for Aratus;\r\nand having fallen in with him on his way home, they first attacked\r\nhim with abusive language, and then threw stones at him; and a number\r\nof people coming to the assistance of both parties, there was a noise\r\nand disturbance in the camp. But the king hearing the noise sent some\r\nofficers to ascertain the cause, and to put an end to the disturbance.\r\nOn their coming upon the scene, Aratus stated what had occurred, called\r\nthose present to witness the truth of his words, and retired to his own\r\ntent; but Leontius by some unexplained means slipped away in the crowd.\r\nWhen informed of what had taken place, the king sent for Megaleas and\r\nCrinon and rebuked them sharply: and when they not only expressed no\r\nsubmission, but actually retorted with a declaration that they would\r\nnever desist until they had paid Aratus out, the king, enraged at their\r\nwords, at once required them to give security for the payment of a fine\r\nof twenty talents, and ordered them to be placed under arrest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrival at Leucas. Megaleas fined twenty talents.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ Next morning, too, he sent for Aratus and bade him have no\r\nfears, for that he would see that the business was properly settled.\r\nWhen Leontius learned what had happened to Megaleas, he came to the\r\nking’s tent with some peltasts, believing that, owing to his youth,\r\nhe should overawe the king, and quickly induce him to repent of his\r\npurpose. Coming into the royal presence he demanded who had ventured\r\nto lay hands on Megaleas, and lead him to confinement? But when the\r\nking answered with firmness that he had given the order, Leontius was\r\ndismayed; and, with an exclamation of indignant sorrow, departed in\r\nhigh wrath.\r\n\r\nImmediately after getting the fleet across the gulf, and anchoring\r\nat Leucas, the king first gave orders to the officers appointed to\r\ndistribute the spoils to carry out that business with all despatch; and\r\nthen summoned his friends to council, and tried the case of Megaleas.\r\nIn his speech as accuser Aratus went over the crimes of Leontius\r\nand his party from beginning to end; detailed the massacre in Argos\r\nperpetrated by them after the departure of Antigonus; their arrangement\r\nmade with Apelles; and finally their contrivance to prevent success at\r\nPalus. Of all these accusations he gave distinct proof, and brought\r\nforward witnesses: and Megaleas and Crinon being entirely unable to\r\nrefute any of them, were unanimously condemned by the king’s friends.\r\nCrinon remained under arrest, but Leontius went bail for the payment of\r\nthe Megaleas’s fine. Thus the intrigue of Apelles and Leontius turned\r\nout quite contrary to their original hopes: for they had expected, by\r\nterrifying Aratus and isolating Philip, to do whatever seemed to suit\r\ntheir interests; whereas the result had been exactly the reverse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lycurgus of Sparta attacks Tegea.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ About the same time Lycurgus returned from Messenia without\r\nhaving accomplished anything of importance. Afterwards he started again\r\nand seized Tegea. The inhabitants having retreated into the citadel,\r\nhe determined to besiege it; but finding himself unable to make any\r\nimpression upon it he returned once more to Sparta.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elis.]\r\n\r\nThe Eleans after overrunning Dymaea, gained an easy victory over some\r\ncavalry that had come out to resist them, by decoying them into an\r\nambush. They killed a considerable number of the Gallic mercenaries,\r\nand among the natives whom they took prisoners were Polymedes of\r\nAegium, and Agesipolis, and Diocles of Dyme.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dorimachus recalled from Thessaly by Philip’s invasion of\r\nAetolia.]\r\n\r\nDorimachus had made his expedition originally, as I have already\r\nmentioned, under the conviction that he would be able to devastate\r\nThessaly without danger to himself, and would force Philip to raise the\r\nsiege of Palus. But when he found Chrysogonus and Petraeus ready in\r\nThessaly to engage him, he did not venture to descend into the plain,\r\nbut kept close upon the skirts of the mountains; and when news reached\r\nhim of the Macedonian invasion of Aetolia, he abandoned his attempt\r\nupon Thessaly, and hurried home to resist the invaders, whom he found\r\nhowever already departed from Aetolia: and so was too late for the\r\ncampaign at all points.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip arrives at Corinth.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king set sail from Leucas; and after ravaging the\r\nterritory of Oeanthe as he coasted along, arrived with his whole fleet\r\nat Corinth, and dropping anchor in the harbour of Lechaeum, disembarked\r\nhis troops, and sent his letter-bearers to the allied cities in the\r\nPeloponnese, naming a day on which he wished all to be at Tegea by\r\nbedtime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tegea.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Amyclae and Sparta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dismay at Sparta.]\r\n\r\n+18.+ Then, without making any stay in Corinth, he gave the Macedonians\r\nmarching orders; and came at the end of a two days’ march by way of\r\nArgos to Tegea. There he took on the Achaean troops that had assembled,\r\nand advanced by the mountain road, being very desirous to effect an\r\nentrance into the territory of the Lacedaemonians before they became\r\naware of it. Thus after a circuitous route through an uninhabited\r\ndistrict he came out upon the hills facing the town, and continued his\r\nadvance right upon Amyclae, keeping the Menelaïum on his right. The\r\nLacedaemonians were dismayed and terrified at seeing from the town the\r\narmy passing along the hills, and wondered what was happening. For\r\nthey were still in a state of excitement at the news of Philip which\r\nhad arrived,—his destruction of Thermus, and his whole campaign in\r\nAetolia; and there was even some talk among them of sending Lycurgus\r\nto the assistance of the Aetolians. But no one had so much as thought\r\nof danger coming so quickly to their own gates from such a distance,\r\nespecially as the youth of the king still gave room for a certain\r\nfeeling of contempt. The event therefore being totally contrary to\r\ntheir expectations, they were naturally in a state of great dismay.\r\nFor the courage and energy beyond his years, with which Philip acted,\r\nreduced all his enemies to a state of the utmost difficulty and terror.\r\nFor setting out, as I have shown, from the centre of Aetolia, and\r\ncrossing the Ambracian gulf by night, he passed over to Leucas; and\r\nafter a two days’ halt there, on the third he renewed his voyage before\r\ndaybreak, and after a two days' sail, during which he ravaged the\r\nseaboard of the Aetolians, he dropped anchor in Lechaeum; thence, after\r\nseven days' continuous march, he arrived on the heights above Sparta in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Menelaïum,—a feat which most of those even who\r\nsaw it done could scarcely believe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helos.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gythium.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carnium.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ While the Lacedaemonians were thus thoroughly terrified at the\r\nunexpected danger, and at a loss what to do to meet it, Philip encamped\r\non the first day at Amyclae: a place in Laconia about twenty stades\r\nfrom Lacedaemon, exceedingly rich in forest and corn, and containing a\r\ntemple of Apollo, which is about the most splendid of all the temples\r\nin Laconia, situated in that quarter of the city which slopes down\r\ntowards the sea. Next day the king descended to a place called the Camp\r\nof Pyrrhus,[254] wasting the country as he went. After devastating\r\nthe neighbouring districts for the two following days, he encamped\r\nnear Carnium; thence he started for Asine, and after some fruitless\r\nassaults upon it, he started again, and thenceforth devoted himself\r\nto plundering all the country bordering on the Cretan Sea as far as\r\nTaenarum. Then, once more changing the direction of his march, he\r\nadvanced to Gythium, the naval arsenal of Sparta, which possesses a\r\nsafe harbour, and is about thirty stades from the city. Then leaving\r\nthis on the right, he pitched his camp in the territory of Helos,\r\nwhich of all the districts of Laconia is the most extensive and most\r\nbeautiful. Thence he sent out foraging parties and wasted the country\r\nwith fire and sword, and destroyed the crops in it: pushing his\r\ndevastation as far as Acriae and Leucae, and even to the district of\r\nBoeae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abortive attempt of the Messenians to join Philip.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lycurgus resolves to intercept Philip on his return at the\r\npass opposite Sparta.]\r\n\r\n+20.+ On the receipt of the despatch from Philip commanding the\r\nlevy, the Messenians were no less forward than the other allies to\r\nundertake it. They showed indeed great zeal in making the expedition,\r\nsending out the flower of their troops, two thousand infantry and two\r\nhundred cavalry. Owing, however, to their distance from the seat of\r\nwar, they arrived at Tegea after Philip had left, and at first were\r\nat a loss what to do; but being very anxious not to appear lukewarm\r\nin the campaign, because of the suspicions which had attached to them\r\nbefore, they pressed forward through Argolis into Laconia, with a view\r\nof effecting a junction with Philip; and having reached a fort called\r\nGlympes, which is situated on the frontiers of Argolis and Laconia,\r\nthey encamped there in an unskilful and careless manner: for they\r\nneither entrenched themselves with ditch nor rampart, nor selected an\r\nadvantageous spot; but trusting to the friendly disposition of the\r\nnatives, bivouacked there unsuspiciously outside the walls of the\r\nfortress. But on news being brought to Lycurgus of the arrival of the\r\nMessenians, he took his mercenaries and some Lacedaemonians with him,\r\nand reaching the place before daybreak, boldly attacked the camp. Ill\r\nadvised as the proceedings of the Messenians had been, and especially\r\nin advancing from Tegea with inadequate numbers and without the\r\ndirection of experts, in the actual hour of danger, when the enemy was\r\nupon them, they did all that circumstances admitted of to secure their\r\nsafety. For as soon as they saw the enemy appearing they abandoned\r\neverything and took refuge within the fort. Accordingly, though\r\nLycurgus captured most of the horses and the baggage, he did not take\r\na single prisoner, and only succeeded in killing eight of the cavalry.\r\nAfter this reverse, the Messenians returned home through Argolis: but\r\nelated with success Lycurgus went to Sparta, and set about preparations\r\nfor war; and took secret counsel with his friends to prevent Philip\r\nfrom getting safe out of the country without an engagement. Meanwhile\r\nthe king had started from the district of Helos, and was on his return\r\nmarch, wasting the country as he came; and on the fourth day, about\r\nnoon, arrived once more with his whole army at Amyclae.\r\n\r\n+21.+ Leaving directions with his officers and friends as to the coming\r\nengagement, Lycurgus himself left Sparta and occupied the ground\r\nnear the Menelaïum, with as many as two thousand men. He agreed with\r\nthe officers in the town that they should watch carefully, in order\r\nthat, whenever he raised the signal, they might lead out their troops\r\nfrom the town at several points at once, and draw them up facing the\r\nEurotas, at the spot where it is nearest the town. Such were the\r\nmeasures and designs of Lycurgus and the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Value of local knowledge.]\r\n\r\nBut lest ignorance of the locality should render my story\r\nunintelligible and vague, I must describe its natural features and\r\ngeneral position: following my practice throughout this work of drawing\r\nout the analogies and likenesses between places which are unknown and\r\nthose already known and described. For seeing that in war, whether\r\nby sea or land, it is the difference of position which generally is\r\nthe cause of failure; and since I wish all to know, not so much what\r\nhappened, as how it happened, I must not pass over local description in\r\ndetailing events of any sort, least of all in such as relate to war:\r\nand I must not shrink from using as landmarks, at one time harbours and\r\nseas and islands, at another temples, mountains, or local names; or,\r\nfinally, variations in the aspect of the heaven, these being of the\r\nmost universal application throughout the world. For it is thus, and\r\nthus only, that it is possible, as I have said, to bring my readers to\r\na conception of an unknown scene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The position of Sparta and the neighbouring heights.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dispositions of Lycurgus.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ These then are the features of the country in question. Sparta,\r\nas a whole, is in the shape of a circle; and is situated on level\r\nground, broken at certain points by irregularities and hills. The river\r\nEurotas flows past it on the east, and for the greater part of the year\r\nis too large to be forded; and the hills on which the Menelaïum stands\r\nare on the other side of the river, to the south-east of the town,\r\nrugged and difficult of access and exceedingly lofty; they exactly\r\ncommand the space between the town and the Eurotas, which flows at the\r\nvery foot of the hill, the whole valley being at this point no more\r\nthan a stade and a half wide. Through this Philip was obliged to pass\r\non his return march, with the city, and the Lacedaemonians ready and\r\ndrawn up for battle, on his left hand, and on his right the river, and\r\nthe division of Lycurgus posted upon the hills. In addition to these\r\narrangements the Lacedaemonians had had recourse to the following\r\ndevice: They had dammed up the river above the town, and turned the\r\nstream upon the space between the town and the hills; with the result\r\nthat the ground became so wet that men could not keep their feet, to\r\nsay nothing of horses. The only course, therefore, left to the king was\r\nto lead his men close under the skirts of the hills, thus presenting to\r\nthe attack of the enemy a long line of march, in which it was difficult\r\nfor one part to relieve another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip succeeds in baffling Lycurgus.]\r\n\r\nPhilip perceived these difficulties, and after consultation with\r\nhis friends decided that the matter of most urgent necessity was to\r\ndislodge the division of Lycurgus, first of all, from the position\r\nnear the Menelaïum. He took therefore his mercenaries, peltasts, and\r\nIllyrians, and advanced across the river in the direction of the hills.\r\nPerceiving Philip’s design, Lycurgus began getting his men ready, and\r\nexhorted them to face the battle, and at the same time displayed the\r\nsignal to the forces in the town: whereupon those whose duty it was\r\nimmediately led out the troops from the town, as had been arranged, and\r\ndrew them up outside the wall, with the cavalry on their right wing.\r\n\r\n+23.+ When he had got within distance of Lycurgus, Philip at first\r\nordered the mercenaries to charge alone: and, accordingly, their\r\nsuperiority in arms and position contributed not a little to give the\r\nLacedaemonians the upper hand at the beginning of the engagement. But\r\nwhen Philip supported his men by sending his reserve of peltasts on to\r\nthe field, and caused the Illyrians to charge the enemy on the flanks,\r\nthe king’s mercenaries were encouraged by the appearance of these\r\nreserves to renew the battle with much more vigour than ever; while\r\nLycurgus’s men, terrified at the approach of the heavy-armed soldiers,\r\ngave way and fled, leaving a hundred killed and rather more prisoners,\r\nwhile the rest escaped into the town. Lycurgus himself, with a few\r\nfollowers going by a deserted and pathless route, made his way into the\r\ntown under cover of night. Philip secured the hills by means of the\r\nIllyrians; and, accompanied by his light-armed troops and peltasts,\r\nrejoined his main forces. Just at the same time Aratus, leading the\r\nphalanx from Amyclae, had come close to the town. So the king, after\r\nrecrossing the Eurotas, halted with his light-armed peltasts and\r\ncavalry until the heavy-armed got safely through the narrow part of the\r\nroad at the foot of the hills. Then the troops in the city ventured to\r\nattack the covering force of cavalry. There was a serious engagement,\r\nin which the peltasts fought with conspicuous valour; and the success\r\nof Philip being now beyond dispute, he chased the Lacedaemonians to\r\ntheir very gates, and then, having got his army safely across the\r\nEurotas he brought up the rear of his phalanx.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s strong position.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sellasia, B.C. 222.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip proceeds to Tegea, where he is visited by ambassadors\r\nfrom Rhodes and Chios seeking to end the Aetolian war.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ But it was now getting late: and being obliged to encamp, he\r\navailed himself for that purpose of a place at the very mouth of the\r\npass, his officers having chanced already to have selected that very\r\nplace; than which it would be impossible to find one more advantageous\r\nfor making an invasion of Laconia by way of Sparta itself. For it is\r\nat the very commencement of this pass, just where a man coming from\r\nTegea, or, indeed, from any point in the interior, approaches Sparta;\r\nbeing about two stades from the town and right upon the river. The\r\nside of it which looks towards the town and river is entirely covered\r\nby a steep, lofty, and entirely inaccessible rock; while the top of\r\nthis rock is a table-land of good soil and well supplied with water,\r\nand very conveniently situated for the exit and entrance of troops.\r\nA general, therefore, who was encamped there, and who had command of\r\nthe height overhanging it, would evidently be in a place of safety as\r\nregards the neighbouring town, and in a most advantageous situation as\r\ncommanding the entrance and exit of the narrow pass. Having accordingly\r\nencamped himself on this spot in safety, next day Philip sent forward\r\nhis baggage; but drew out his army on the table-land in full view of\r\nthe citizens, and remained thus for a short time. Then he wheeled to\r\nthe left and marched in the direction of Tegea; and when he reached\r\nthe site of the battle of Antigonus and Cleomenes, he encamped there.\r\nNext day, having made an inspection of the ground and sacrificed to\r\nthe gods on both the eminences, Olympus and Evas, he advanced with his\r\nrear-guard strengthened. On arriving at Tegea he caused all the booty\r\nto be sold; and then, marching through Argos, arrived with his whole\r\nforce at Corinth. There ambassadors appeared from Rhodes and Chios to\r\nnegotiate a suspension of hostilities; to whom the king gave audience,\r\nand feigning that he was, and always had been, quite ready to come to\r\nterms with the Aetolians, sent them away to negotiate with the latter\r\nalso; while he himself went down to Lechaeum, and made preparations\r\nfor an embarkation, as he had an important undertaking to complete in\r\nPhocis.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treason of Megaleas and Ptolemy.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ Leontius, Megaleas, and Ptolemy, being still persuaded that they\r\ncould frighten Philip, and thus neutralise their former failures,\r\ntook this opportunity of tampering with the peltasts, and what the\r\nMacedonians call the _Agema_,[255] by suggesting to them that they were\r\nrisking their all, and getting none of their just rights, nor receiving\r\nthe booty which, according to custom, properly fell to their share. By\r\nthese words they incited the young men to collect together, and attempt\r\nto plunder the tents of the most prominent of the king’s friends,\r\nand to pull down the doors, and break through the roof of the royal\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe whole city being thereby in a state of confusion and uproar, the\r\nking heard of it and immediately came hastily running to the town\r\nfrom Lechaeum; and having summoned the Macedonians to the theatre he\r\naddressed them in terms of mingled exhortation and rebuke for what had\r\nhappened. A scene of great uproar and confusion followed: and while\r\nsome advised him to arrest and call to account the guilty, others\r\nto come to terms and declare an indemnity, for the moment the king\r\ndissembled his feelings, and pretended to be satisfied; and so with\r\nsome words of exhortation addressed to all, retired: and though he\r\nknew quite well who were the ringleaders in the disturbance, he made a\r\npolitic pretence of not doing so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apelles sent for by Leontius.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apelles rebuffed by the king.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courtiers.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ After this outbreak the king’s schemes in Phocis met with\r\ncertain impediments which prevented their present execution. Meanwhile\r\nLeontius, despairing of success by his own efforts, had recourse to\r\nApelles, urging him by frequent messages to come from Chalcis, and\r\nsetting forth his own difficulties and the awkwardness of his position\r\nowing to his quarrel with the king. Now Apelles had been acting in\r\nChalcis with an unwarrantable assumption of authority. He gave out\r\nthat the king was still a mere boy, and for the most part under his\r\ncontrol, and without independent power over anything; the management\r\nof affairs and the supreme authority in the kingdom he asserted to\r\nbelong to himself. Accordingly, the magistrates and commissioners of\r\nMacedonia and Thessaly reported to him; and the cities in Greece in\r\ntheir decrees and votes of honours and rewards made brief reference to\r\nthe king, while Apelles was all in all to them. Philip had been kept\r\ninformed of this, and had for some time past been feeling annoyed and\r\noffended at it,—Aratus being at his side, and using skilful means to\r\nfurther his own views; still he kept his own counsel, and did not let\r\nany one see what he intended to do, or what he had in his mind. In\r\nignorance, therefore, of his own position, and persuaded that, if he\r\ncould only come into Philip’s presence, he would manage everything as\r\nhe chose, Apelles set out from Chalcis to the assistance of Leontius.\r\nOn his arrival at Corinth, Leontius, Ptolemy and Megaleas, being\r\ncommanders of the peltasts and the other chief divisions of the army,\r\ntook great pains to incite the young men to go to meet him. He entered\r\nthe town, therefore, with great pomp, owing to the number of officers\r\nand soldiers who went to meet him, and proceeded straight to the royal\r\nquarters. But when he would have entered, according to his former\r\ncustom, one of the ushers prevented him, saying that the king was\r\nengaged. Troubled at this unusual repulse, and hesitating for a long\r\nwhile what to do, Apelles at last turned round and retired. Thereupon\r\nall those who were escorting him began at once openly to fall off from\r\nhim and disperse, so that at last he entered his own lodging, with\r\nhis children, absolutely alone. So true it is all the world over that\r\na moment exalts and abases us; but most especially is this true of\r\ncourtiers. They indeed are exactly like counters on a board, which,\r\naccording to the pleasure of the calculator, are one moment worth a\r\nfarthing, the next a talent. Even so courtiers at the king’s nod are\r\none moment at the summit of prosperity, at another the objects of\r\npity. When Megaleas saw that the help he had looked for from Apelles\r\nwas failing him, he was exceedingly frightened, and made preparations\r\nfor flight. Apelles meanwhile was admitted to the king’s banquets\r\nand honours of that sort, but had no share in his council or daily\r\nsocial employments; and when, some days afterwards, the king resumed\r\nhis voyage from Lechaeum, to complete his designs in Phocis, he took\r\nApelles with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flight of Megaleas.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leontius put to death.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ The expedition to Phocis proving a failure, the king was retiring\r\nfrom Elatea; and while this was going on, Megaleas removed to Athens,\r\nleaving Leontius behind him as his security for his twenty talents\r\nfine. The Athenian Strategi however refused to admit him, and he\r\ntherefore resumed his journey and went to Thebes. Meanwhile the king\r\nput to sea from the coast of Cirrha and sailed with his guards[256]\r\nto the harbour of Sicyon, whence he went up to the city and, excusing\r\nhimself to the magistrates, took up his quarters with Aratus, and\r\nspent the whole of his time with him, ordering Apelles to sail back\r\nto Corinth. But upon news being brought him of the proceedings of\r\nMegaleas, he despatched the peltasts, whose regular commander was\r\nLeontius, in the charge of Taurion to Triphylia, on the pretext of some\r\nservice of pressing need; and, when they had departed, he gave orders\r\nto arrest Leontius to answer his bail. When the peltasts heard what had\r\nhappened from a messenger sent to them by Leontius, they despatched\r\nambassadors to the king, begging him that, “if he had arrested Leontius\r\non any other score, not to have him tried on the charges alleged\r\nagainst him without their presence: for otherwise they should consider\r\nthemselves treated with signal contempt, and to be one and all involved\r\nin the condemnation.” Such was the freedom of speech towards their king\r\nwhich the Macedonians always enjoyed. They added, that “if the arrest\r\nwas on account of his bail for Megaleas, they would themselves pay the\r\nmoney by a common subscription.” The king however was so enraged, that\r\nhe put Leontius to death sooner than he had intended, owing to the zeal\r\ndisplayed by the peltasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A thirty days' truce offered by the Aetolians through the\r\nRhodian and Chian ambassadors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Treason of Megaleas detected. His arrest and suicide.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Appelles.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ Presently the ambassadors of Rhodes and Chios returned from\r\nAetolia. They had agreed to a truce of thirty days, and asserted that\r\nthe Aetolians were ready to make peace: they had also arranged for\r\na stated day on which they claimed that Philip should meet them at\r\nRhium; undertaking that the Aetolians would be ready to do anything on\r\ncondition of making peace. Philip accepted the truce and wrote letters\r\nto the allies, bidding them send assessors and commissioners to discuss\r\nthe terms with the Aetolians; while he himself sailed from Lechaeum and\r\narrived on the second day at Patrae. Just then certain letters were\r\nsent to him from Phocis, which Megaleas had written to the Aetolians,\r\nexhorting them not to be frightened, but to persist in the war, because\r\nPhilip was in extremities through a lack of provisions. Besides this\r\nthe letters contained some offensive and bitter abuse of the king. As\r\nsoon as he had read these, the king feeling no doubt that Apelles was\r\nthe ringleader of the mischief, placed him under a guard and despatched\r\nhim in all haste to Corinth, with his son and favourite boy; while\r\nhe sent Alexander to Thebes to arrest Megaleas, with orders to bring\r\nhim before the magistrates to answer to his bail. When Alexander had\r\nfulfilled his commission, Megaleas, not daring to await the issue,\r\ncommitted suicide: and about the same time Apelles, his son and\r\nfavourite boy, ended their lives also. Such was the end of these men,\r\nthoroughly deserved in every way, and especially for their outrageous\r\nconduct to Aratus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of the negotiations with the Aetolians.]\r\n\r\n+29.+ Now the Aetolians were at first very anxious for the ratification\r\nof a peace, because they found the war burdensome, and because things\r\nhad not gone as they expected. For, looking to his tender years and\r\nlack of experience, they had expected to have a mere child to deal with\r\nin Philip; but had found him a full-grown man both in his designs and\r\nhis manner of executing them: while they had themselves made a display\r\nof imbecility and childishness alike in the general conduct, and the\r\nparticular actions, of the campaign. But as soon as they heard of the\r\noutbreak of the disturbance among the peltasts, and of the deaths of\r\nApelles and Leontius, hoping that there was a serious and formidable\r\ndisaffection at the court, they procrastinated until they had outstayed\r\nthe day appointed for the meeting at Rhium. But Philip was delighted\r\nto seize the pretext: for he felt confident of success in the war,\r\nand had already resolved to avoid coming to terms. He therefore at\r\nonce exhorted such of the allies as had come to meet him to make\r\npreparations, not for the peace, but for war; and putting to sea again\r\nsailed back to Corinth. He then dismissed his Macedonian soldiers to go\r\nhome through Thessaly for the winter: while he himself putting to sea\r\nfrom Cenchreae, and coasting along Attica, sailed through the Euripus\r\nto Demetrias, and there before a jury of Macedonians had Ptolemy tried\r\nand put to death, who was the last survivor of the conspiracy of\r\nLeontius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 218. Review of the events of the year in Italy, Asia,\r\nSparta.]\r\n\r\nIt was in this season that Hannibal, having succeeded in entering\r\nItaly, was lying encamped in presence of the Roman army in the\r\nvalley of the Padus. Antiochus, after subduing the greater part of\r\nCoele-Syria, had once more dismissed his army into winter quarters.\r\nThe Spartan king Lycurgus fled to Aetolia in fear of the Ephors: for\r\nacting on a false charge that he was meditating a _coup d'état_, they\r\nhad collected the young men and come to his house at night. But getting\r\nprevious intimation of what was impending, he had quitted the town\r\naccompanied by the members of his household.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter of B.C. 218-217.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disorder in Achaia owing to the incompetence of the\r\nStrategus Eperatus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: May, B.C. 217. Aratus the elder elected Strategus.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ When the next winter came, Philip having departed to Macedonia,\r\nand the Achaean Strategus Eperatus having incurred the contempt of the\r\nAchaean soldiers and the complete disregard of the mercenaries, no one\r\nwould obey his orders, and no preparation was made for the defence of\r\nthe country. This was observed by Pyrrhias, who had been sent by the\r\nAetolians to command the Eleans. He had under him a force of thirteen\r\nhundred Aetolians, and the mercenaries hired by the Eleans, as well as\r\na thousand Elean infantry and two hundred Elean cavalry, amounting in\r\nall to three thousand: and he now began committing frequent raids, not\r\nonly upon the territories of Dyme and Pharae, but upon that of Patrae\r\nalso. Finally he pitched his camp on what is called the Panachaean\r\nMountain, which commands the town of Patrae, and began wasting the\r\nwhole district towards Rhium and Aegium. The result was that the\r\ncities, being exposed to much suffering, and unable to obtain any\r\nassistance, began to make difficulties about paying their contribution\r\nto the league; and the soldiers finding their pay always in arrear\r\nand never paid at the right time acted in the same way about going to\r\nthe relief of the towns. Both parties thus mutually retaliating on\r\neach other, affairs went from bad to worse, and at last the foreign\r\ncontingent broke up altogether. And all this was the result of the\r\nincompetence of the chief magistrate. The time for the next election\r\nfinding Achaean affairs in this state, Eperatus laid down his office,\r\nand just at the beginning of summer Aratus the elder was elected\r\nStrategus.[257]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 140th Olympiad, Asia.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs in Europe. We have now arrived at a\r\nproper juncture, both of events and of time, to transfer our narrative\r\nto the history of Asia. I will therefore resume my story of the\r\ntransactions which occurred there during the same Olympiad.\r\n\r\n+31.+ I will first endeavour, in accordance with my original plan,\r\nto give an account of the war between Antiochus and Ptolemy for the\r\npossession of Coele-Syria. Though I am fully aware that at the period,\r\nat which I have stopped in my Greek history, this war was all but\r\ndecided and concluded, I have yet deliberately chosen this particular\r\nbreak and division in my narrative; believing that I shall effectually\r\nprovide against the possibility of mistakes on the part of my readers\r\nin regard to dates, if I indicate in the course of my narrative the\r\nyears in this Olympiad in which the events in the several parts of the\r\nworld, as well as in Greece, began and ended. For I think nothing more\r\nessential to the clearness of my history of this Olympiad than to avoid\r\nconfusing the several narratives. Our object should be to distinguish\r\nand keep them separate as much as possible, until we come to the next\r\nOlympiad, and begin setting down the contemporary events in the several\r\ncountries under each year. For since I have undertaken to write, not a\r\nparticular, but a universal history, and have ventured upon a plan on\r\na greater scale, as I have already shown, than any of my predecessors,\r\nit will be necessary also for me to take greater care than they, as\r\nto my method of treatment and arrangement; so as to secure clearness,\r\nboth in the details, and in the general view adopted in my history. I\r\nwill accordingly go back a short way in the history of the kingdoms\r\nof Antiochus and Ptolemy, and try to fix upon a starting-point for my\r\nnarrative which shall be accepted and recognised by all: for this is a\r\nmatter of the first importance.\r\n\r\n+32.+ For the old saying, “Well begun is half done,” was meant by its\r\ninventors to urge the importance of taking the greater pains to make a\r\ngood beginning than anything else. And though some may consider this an\r\nexaggeration, in my opinion it comes short of the truth; for one might\r\nsay with confidence, not that “the beginning was half the business,”\r\nbut rather that it was near being the whole. For how can one make a\r\ngood beginning without having first grasped in thought the complete\r\nplan, or without knowing where, with what object, and with what purpose\r\nhe is undertaking the business? Or how can a man sum up a series\r\nof events satisfactorily without a reference to their origin, and\r\nwithout showing his point of departure, or why and how he has arrived\r\nat the particular crisis at which he finds himself? Therefore both\r\nhistorian and reader alike should be exceedingly careful to mark the\r\nbeginnings of events, with a conviction that their influence does not\r\nstop half-way, but is paramount to the end. And this is what I shall\r\nendeavour to do.\r\n\r\n+33.+ I am aware, however, that a similar profession has been made by\r\nmany other historians of an intention to write a universal history,\r\nand of undertaking a work on a larger scale than their predecessors.\r\nAbout these writers, putting out of the question Ephorus, the first\r\nand only man who has really attempted a universal history, I will\r\nnot mention any name or say more about them than this,—that several\r\nof my contemporaries, while professing to write a universal history\r\nhave imagined that they could tell the story of the war of Rome and\r\nCarthage in three or four pages. Yet every one knows that events more\r\nnumerous or important were never accomplished in Iberia, Libya, Sicily,\r\nand Italy than in that war; and that the Hannibalian war was the most\r\nfamous and lasting of any that has taken place except the Sicilian.\r\nSo momentous was it, that all the rest of the world were compelled to\r\nwatch it in terrified expectation of what would follow from its final\r\ncatastrophe. Yet some of these writers, without even giving as many\r\ndetails of it as those who, after the manner of the vulgar, inscribe\r\nrude records of events on house walls, pretend to have embraced the\r\nwhole of Greek and foreign history. The truth of the matter is, that\r\nit is a very easy matter to profess to undertake works of the greatest\r\nimportance; but by no means so simple a matter in practice to attain\r\nto any excellence. The former is open to every one with the requisite\r\naudacity: the latter is rare, and is given to few. So much for those\r\nwho use pompous language about themselves and their historical works. I\r\nwill now return to my narrative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Ptolemy Euergetes, B.C. 222.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ Immediately after his father’s death, Ptolemy Philopator put his\r\nbrother Magas and his partisans to death, and took possession of the\r\nthrone of Egypt. He thought that he had now freed himself by this act\r\nfrom domestic danger; and that by the deaths of Antigonus and Seleucus,\r\nand their being respectively succeeded by mere children like Antiochus\r\nand Philip, fortune had released him from danger abroad. He therefore\r\nfelt secure of his position and began conducting his reign as though it\r\nwere a perpetual festival. He would attend to no business, and would\r\nhardly grant an interview to the officials about the court, or at the\r\nhead of the administrative departments in Egypt. Even his agents abroad\r\nfound him entirely careless and indifferent; though his predecessors,\r\nfar from taking less interest in foreign affairs, had generally given\r\nthem precedence over those of Egypt itself. For being masters of\r\nCoele-Syria and Cyprus, they maintained a threatening attitude towards\r\nthe kings of Syria, both by land and sea; and were also in a commanding\r\nposition in regard to the princes of Asia, as well as the islands,\r\nthrough their possession of the most splendid cities, strongholds, and\r\nharbours all along the sea-coast from Pamphylia to the Hellespont and\r\nthe district round Lysimachia. Moreover they were favourably placed for\r\nan attack upon Thrace and Macedonia from their possession of Aenus,\r\nMaroneia, and more distant cities still. And having thus stretched\r\nforth their hands to remote regions, and long ago strengthened their\r\nposition by a ring of princedoms, these kings had never been anxious\r\nabout their rule in Egypt; and had naturally, therefore, given great\r\nattention to foreign politics. But when Philopator, absorbed in\r\nunworthy intrigues, and senseless and continuous drunkenness, treated\r\nthese several branches of government with equal indifference, it was\r\nnaturally not long before more than one was found to lay plots against\r\nhis life as well as his power: of whom the first was Cleomenes, the\r\nSpartan.[258]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenes endeavours to get assistance from the Egyptian\r\ncourt.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ As long as Euergetes was alive, with whom he had agreed to make\r\nan alliance and confederacy, Cleomenes took no steps. But upon that\r\nmonarch’s death, seeing that the time was slipping away, and that the\r\npeculiar position of affairs in Greece seemed almost to cry aloud\r\nfor Cleomenes,—for Antigonus was dead, the Achaeans involved in war,\r\nand the Lacedaemonians were at one with the Aetolians in hostility\r\nto the Achaeans and Macedonians, which was the policy originally\r\nadopted by Cleomenes,—then, indeed, he was actually compelled to use\r\nsome expedition, and to bestir himself to secure his departure from\r\nAlexandria. First therefore, in interviews with the king, he urged him\r\nto send him out with the needful amount of supplies and troops; but\r\nnot being listened to in this request, he next begged him earnestly\r\nto let him go alone with his own servants; for he affirmed that the\r\nstate of affairs was such as to show him sufficient opportunities for\r\nrecovering his ancestral throne. The king, however, for the reasons\r\nI have mentioned, taking absolutely no interest in such matters, nor\r\nexercising any foresight whatever, continued with extraordinary folly\r\nand blindness to neglect the petitions of Cleomenes. But the party of\r\nSosibius, the leading statesman at the time, took counsel together,\r\nand agreed on the following course of action in regard to him. They\r\ndecided not to send him out with a fleet and supplies; for, owing to\r\nthe death of Antigonus, they took little account of foreign affairs,\r\nand thought money spent on such things would be thrown away. Besides,\r\nthey were afraid that since Antigonus was dead, and no one was left\r\nwho could balance him, Cleomenes might, if he got Greece into his\r\npower quickly and without trouble, prove a serious and formidable\r\nrival to themselves; especially as he had had a clear view of Egyptian\r\naffairs, had learnt to despise the king; and had discovered that the\r\nkingdom had many parts loosely attached, and widely removed from the\r\ncentre, and presenting many facilities for revolutionary movements:\r\nfor not a few of their ships were at Samos, and a considerable force\r\nof soldiers at Ephesus. These considerations induced them to reject\r\nthe idea of sending Cleomenes out with supplies; for they thought it\r\nby no means conducive to their interests to carelessly let a man go,\r\nwho was certain to be their opponent and enemy. The other proposal was\r\nto keep him there against his will; but this they all rejected at once\r\nwithout discussion, on the principle that the lion and the flock could\r\nnot safely share the same stall. Sosibius himself took the lead in\r\nregarding this idea with aversion, and his reason was this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reason of the opposition of Sosibius.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ While engaged in effecting the destruction of Magas and Berenice,\r\nhis anxiety at the possible failure of his attempt, especially through\r\nthe courageous character of Berenice, had forced him to flatter the\r\ncourtiers, and give them all hopes of advantage in case his intrigue\r\nsucceeded. It was at this juncture that, observing Cleomenes to\r\nstand in need of the king’s help, and to be possessed of a clear\r\nunderstanding and a genuine grasp of the situation, he admitted him to\r\na knowledge of his design, holding out to him hopes of great advantage.\r\nAnd when Cleomenes saw that Sosibius was in a state of great anxiety,\r\nand above all afraid of the foreign soldiers and mercenaries, he bade\r\nhim not be alarmed; and undertook that the foreign soldiers should do\r\nhim no harm, but should rather be of assistance to him. And on Sosibius\r\nexpressing surprise rather than conviction at this promise, he said,\r\n“Don't you see that there are three thousand foreign soldiers here from\r\nthe Peloponnese, and a thousand from Crete? I have only to nod to these\r\nmen, and every man of them will at once do what I want. With these all\r\nready to hand, whom do you fear? Surely not mere Syrians and Carians.”\r\nSosibius was much pleased at the remark at the time, and doubly\r\nencouraged in his intrigue against Berenice; but ever afterwards, when\r\nobserving the indifference of the king, he repeated it to himself, and\r\nput before his eyes the boldness of Cleomenes, and the goodwill of the\r\nforeign contingent towards him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The intrigue of Sosibius against Cleomenes.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ These feelings now moved him to advise the king and his friends\r\nabove all things to arrest and incarcerate Cleomenes: and to carry\r\nout this policy he availed himself of the following circumstance,\r\nwhich happened conveniently for him. There was a certain Messenian\r\ncalled Nicagoras, an ancestral guest-friend of the Lacedaemonian\r\nking Archidamus. They had not previously had much intercourse; but\r\nwhen Archidamus fled from Sparta, for fear of Cleomenes, and came to\r\nMessenia, not only did Nicagoras show great kindness in receiving\r\nhim under his roof and furnishing him with other necessaries, but\r\nfrom the close association that followed a very warm friendship and\r\nintimacy sprang up between them: and accordingly when Cleomenes\r\nsubsequently gave Archidamus some expectation of being restored to\r\nhis city, and composing their quarrels, Nicagoras devoted himself to\r\nconducting the negotiation and settling the terms of their compact.\r\nThese being ratified, Archidamus returned to Sparta relying on the\r\ntreaty made by the agency of Nicagoras. But as soon as he met him,\r\nCleomenes assassinated Archidamus,[259] sparing however Nicagoras\r\nand his companions. To the outside world Nicagoras pretended to be\r\nunder an obligation to Cleomenes for saving his life; but in heart\r\nhe was exceedingly incensed at what had happened, because he had the\r\ndiscredit of having been the cause of the king’s death. Now it happened\r\nthat this same Nicagoras had, a short time before the events of which\r\nwe are speaking, come to Alexandria with a cargo of horses. Just as\r\nhe was disembarking he came upon Cleomenes, Panterus, and Hippitas\r\nwalking together along the quay. When Cleomenes saw him, he came up\r\nand welcomed him warmly, and asked him on what business he was come.\r\nUpon his replying that he had brought a cargo of horses, “You had\r\nbetter,” said he, “have brought a cargo of catamites and sakbut girls;\r\nfor that is what the present king is fond of.” Nicagoras laughed, and\r\nsaid nothing at the time: but some days afterwards, when he had, in the\r\ncourse of his horse-sales, become more intimate with Sosibius, he did\r\nCleomenes the ill turn of repeating his recent sarcasm; and seeing that\r\nSosibius heard it with satisfaction, he related to him the whole story\r\nof his grievance against Cleomenes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenes put under arrest.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ Finding then that he was hostile in feeling to Cleomenes,\r\nSosibius persuaded Nicagoras, partly by presents given on the spot\r\nand partly by promises for the future, to write a letter accusing\r\nCleomenes, and leave it sealed; that as soon as he had sailed, as he\r\nwould do in a few days, his servant might bring it to him as though\r\nsent by Nicagoras. Nicagoras performed his part in the plot; and after\r\nhe had sailed, the letter was brought by the servant to Sosibius,\r\nwho at once took the servant and the letter to the king. The servant\r\nstated that Nicagoras had left the letter with orders to deliver it\r\nto Sosibius; and the letter declared that it was the intention of\r\nCleomenes, if he failed to secure his despatch from the country with\r\nsuitable escort and provisions, to stir up a rebellion against the\r\nking. Sosibius at once seized the opportunity of urging on the king and\r\nhis friends to take prompt precautions against Cleomenes and to put him\r\nin ward. This was at once done, and a very large house was assigned to\r\nhim in which he lived under guard, differing from other prisoners only\r\nin the superior size of his prison. Finding himself in this distressing\r\nplight, and with fear of worse for the future, Cleomenes determined to\r\nmake the most desperate attempts for freedom: not so much because he\r\nfelt confident of success,—for he had none of the elements of success\r\nin such an enterprise on his side,—but rather because he was eager to\r\ndie nobly, and endure nothing unworthy of the gallantry which he had\r\npreviously displayed. He must, I think, as is usually the case with men\r\nof high courage, have recalled and reflected upon as his model those\r\nwords of the hero:[260]—\r\n\r\n   “Yea, let me die,—but not a coward’s death,\r\n   Nor all inglorious: let me do one deed,\r\n   That children yet unborn may hear and mark!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bold attempt of Cleomenes to recover his liberty. His\r\nfailure and death, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ He therefore waited for the time at which the king left\r\nAlexandria for Canopus, and then spread a report among his guards\r\nthat he was going to be released by the king; and on this pretext\r\nentertained his own attendants at a banquet, and sent out some flesh\r\nof the sacrificial victims, some garlands, and some wine to his\r\nguards. The latter indulged in these good things unsuspiciously, and\r\nbecame completely drunk; whereupon Cleomenes walked out about noon,\r\naccompanied by his friends and servants armed with daggers, without\r\nbeing noticed by his guard. As the party advanced they met Ptolemy in\r\nthe street, who had been left by the king in charge of the city; and\r\noverawing his attendants by the audacity of his proceeding, dragged\r\nPtolemy himself from his chariot and put him in a place of security,\r\nwhile they loudly called upon the crowds of citizens to assert their\r\nfreedom. But every one was unprepared for the movement, and therefore\r\nno one obeyed their summons or joined them; and they accordingly turned\r\ntheir steps to the citadel, with the intention of bursting open the\r\ndoors and obtaining the help of the prisoners confined there. But the\r\ncommanders of the citadel were on the alert, and learning what was\r\ngoing to take place had secured the entrance gate: having therefore\r\nfailed in this design they killed themselves like brave men and\r\nSpartans.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of Cleomenes: a man of brilliant social qualities,\r\nwith a natural aptitude for affairs, and, in a word, endued with all\r\nthe qualifications of a general and a king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220-219. The origin of the war in Coele-Syria.]\r\n\r\n+40.+ Shortly after the catastrophe of Cleomenes, the governor of\r\nCoele-Syria, who was an Aetolian by birth, resolved to hold treasonable\r\nparley with Antiochus and put the cities of that province into his\r\nhands. He was induced to take this step partly by the contempt with\r\nwhich Ptolemy’s shameful debauchery and general conduct had inspired\r\nhim; and partly by distrust of the king’s ministers, which he had\r\nlearned to entertain in the course of the recent attempt of Antiochus\r\nupon Coele-Syria: for in that campaign he had rendered signal service\r\nto Ptolemy, and yet, far from receiving any thanks for it, he had been\r\nsummoned to Alexandria and barely escaped losing his life. The advances\r\nwhich he now made to Antiochus were gladly received, and the affair was\r\nsoon in the course of being rapidly completed.\r\n\r\nBut I must make my readers acquainted with the position of the royal\r\nfamily of Syria as I have already done with that of Egypt; and in order\r\nto do so, I will go back to the succession of Antiochus to the throne,\r\nand give a summary of events from that point to the beginning of the\r\nwar of which I am to speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 226.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 223. See 4, 48.]\r\n\r\nAntiochus was the younger son of Seleucus Callinicus; and on the\r\ndeath of his father, and the succession in right of seniority of his\r\nbrother Seleucus to the throne, he at first removed to upper Asia\r\nand lived there. But Seleucus having been treacherously assassinated\r\nafter crossing Mount Taurus with his army, as I have already related,\r\nhe succeeded to the throne himself; and made Achaeus governor of Asia\r\non this side Taurus, Molon and his brother Alexander guardians of his\r\ndominions in upper Asia,—Molon acting as Satrap of Media, his brother\r\nof Persia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt of Molon.]\r\n\r\n+41.+ These two brothers despising the king for his youth, and hoping\r\nthat Achaeus would join in their treason, but most of all because\r\nthey dreaded the cruel character and malign influence of Hermeias,\r\nwho was at that time the chief minister of the entire kingdom, formed\r\nthe design of revolting themselves and causing the upper Satrapies to\r\nrevolt also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intrigues of Hermeias.]\r\n\r\nThis Hermeias was a Carian and had obtained his power by the\r\nappointment of the king’s brother Seleucus, who had entrusted it to him\r\nwhen he was setting out on his expedition to the Taurus. Invested with\r\nthis authority he at once began to display jealousy of all those about\r\nthe court who were in any way prominent; and being cruel by nature he\r\ninflicted punishment on some for acts of ignorance, on which he always\r\nmanaged to place the worst interpretation; while against others he\r\nbrought trumped-up and lying charges, and then acted towards them the\r\npart of an inflexible and harsh judge. But his chief end and object was\r\nto secure the destruction of Epigenes who had brought home the forces\r\nwhich had accompanied Seleucus; because he saw that he was a man of\r\neloquence and practical ability, and highly acceptable to the army.\r\nWith this design he was ever on the watch to lay hold of some handle\r\nor pretext against him. Accordingly when a council was summoned on\r\nthe subject of Molon’s revolt, and when the king bade each councillor\r\ndeliver his opinion on the measures to be taken against the rebels,\r\nEpigenes spoke first and urged that “there ought to be no delay,\r\nbut the matter should be taken in hand at once; and that, first and\r\nforemost, the king should go in person to the district, and be ready\r\nto seize the right moments for action. For the actual presence of the\r\nking, and his appearance at the head of an army before the eyes of the\r\ncommon people, would prevent the party of Molon from venturing upon\r\nrevolutionary measures at all; or if they had the audacity to do so,\r\nand persisted in their design, they would be quickly arrested by the\r\npopulace and handed over into the king’s power.”\r\n\r\n+42.+ While Epigenes was still speaking in this strain, Hermeias, in\r\na burst of rage, exclaimed, “That Epigenes had long been secretly\r\nplotting treason against the king; but that now he had happily shown\r\nhis real sentiments by the advice which he had given, proving how eager\r\nhe was to expose the king’s person to the rebels with an insignificant\r\nguard.” For the present he was content with making this insinuation as\r\nfuel for a future outburst of slander, and without further reference\r\nto Epigenes, after what was rather an ill-timed ebullition of temper\r\nthan serious hostility, he delivered his own opinion; which, from his\r\nfear of the danger and his inexperience in war, was against undertaking\r\nthe expedition against Molon personally, but was warmly in favour of\r\nan attack upon Ptolemy, because he was of opinion that this latter war\r\nwould involve no danger, owing to that monarch’s cowardly character.\r\nFor the present he overawed the rest of the council into agreement\r\nwith him and he thereupon sent Xenon and Theodotus Hemiolius with an\r\narmy against Molon; while he employed himself in continually inciting\r\nAntiochus to undertake the expedition into Coele-Syria: thinking that\r\nit was only by involving the young king in war on every side that he\r\ncould escape punishment for his past misdeeds, and avoid being deprived\r\nof his position of authority, for the king would have need of his\r\nservices when he found himself surrounded by struggles and dangers.\r\nWith this object in view, he finally hit on the device of forging a\r\nletter, which he presented to the king as having been sent by Achaeus.\r\nIn it Achaeus was made to state that “Ptolemy had urged him to assert\r\nhis right to the government and promised to supply him with ships and\r\nmoney for all his attempts, if he would only take the crown, and come\r\nforward in the sight of all the world as a claimant of the sovereign\r\npower; which he already possessed, in fact, though he grudged himself\r\nthe title, and rejected the crown which fortune gave him.”\r\n\r\nThis letter successfully imposed on the king, who became ready and\r\neager to go on the expedition against Coele-Syria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Marriage of Antiochus III.]\r\n\r\n+43.+ While this was going on, Antiochus happened to be at Seleucia,\r\non the Zeugma, when the Navarchus Diognetus arrived from Cappadocia,\r\non the Euxine, bringing Laodice, the daughter of king Mithridates,\r\nan unmarried girl, destined to be the king’s wife. This Mithridates\r\nboasted of being a descendant of one of the seven Persians who killed\r\nthe Magus,[261] and he had maintained the sovereignty handed down from\r\nhis ancestors, as it had been originally given to them by Darius along\r\nthe shore of the Euxine. Having gone to meet the princess with all\r\ndue pomp and splendour, Antiochus immediately celebrated his nuptials\r\nwith royal magnificence. The marriage having been completed, he went\r\nto Antioch, and after proclaiming Laodice queen, devoted himself\r\nthenceforth to making preparation for the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Molon had prepared the people of his own Satrapy to go all\r\nlengths, partly by holding out to them hopes of advantages to be\r\ngained, and partly by working on the fears of their chief men, by\r\nmeans of forged letters purporting to be from the king, and couched\r\nin threatening terms. He had also a ready coadjutor in his brother\r\nAlexander; and had secured the co-operation of the neighbouring\r\nSatrapies, by winning the goodwill of their leading men with bribes.\r\nIt was, therefore, at the head of a large force that he took the\r\nfield against the royal generals. Terrified at his approach Xenon\r\nand Theodotus retired into the cities; and Molon, having secured the\r\nterritory of Apollonia, had now a superabundance of supplies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of Media.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ But, indeed, even before that he was a formidable enemy owing to\r\nthe importance of his province. For the whole of the royal horses out\r\nat grass are entrusted to the Medes;[262] and they have an incalculable\r\nquantity of corn and cattle. Of the natural strength and extent of\r\nthe district it would be impossible to speak highly enough. For Media\r\nlies nearly in the centre of Asia and in its size, and in the height\r\nof its steppes compares favourably with every other district of Asia.\r\nAnd again it overlooks some of the most warlike and powerful tribes. On\r\nthe east lie the plains of the desert which intervenes between Persia\r\nand Parthia; and, moreover, it borders on and commands the “Caspian\r\nGates,” and touches the mountains of the Tapyri, which are not far from\r\nthe Hyrcanian Sea. On the south it slopes down to Mesopotamia and the\r\nterritory of Apollonia. It is protected from Persia by the barrier of\r\nMount Zagrus, which has an ascent of a hundred stades, and containing\r\nin its range many separate peaks and defiles is subdivided by deep\r\nvalleys, and at certain points by cañons, inhabited by Cosseans,\r\nCorbrenians, Carchi, and several other barbarous tribes who have\r\nthe reputation of being excellent warriors. Again on the west it is\r\ncoterminous with the tribe called Satrapeii, who are not far from the\r\ntribes which extend as far as the Euxine. Its northern frontier is\r\nfringed by Elymaeans, Aniaracae, Cadusii, and Matiani, and overlooks\r\nthat part of the Pontus which adjoins the Maeotis. Media itself is\r\nsubdivided by several mountain chains running from east to west,\r\nbetween which are plains thickly studded with cities and villages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon takes up arms.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ Being masters, then, of a territory of proportions worthy of a\r\nkingdom, his great power had made Molon from the first a formidable\r\nenemy: but when the royal generals appeared to have abandoned the\r\ncountry to him, and his own forces were elated at the successful issue\r\nof their first hopes, the terror which he inspired became absolute, and\r\nhe was believed by the Asiatics to be irresistible. Taking advantage\r\nof this, he first of all resolved to cross the Tigris and lay siege to\r\nSeleucia; but when his passage across the river was stopped by Zeuxis\r\nseizing the river boats, he retired to the camp at Ctesiphon, and set\r\nabout preparing winter quarters for his army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Xenoetas sent against Molon, B.C. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King Antiochus in Coele-Syria.]\r\n\r\nWhen King Antiochus heard of Molon’s advance and the retreat of his\r\nown generals, he was once more for giving up the expedition against\r\nPtolemy, and going in person on the campaign against Molon, and not\r\nletting slip the proper time for action. But Hermeias persisted in his\r\noriginal plan, and despatched the Achaean Xenoetas against Molon, in\r\ncommand of an army, with full powers; asserting that against rebels it\r\nwas fitting that generals should have the command; but that the king\r\nought to confine himself to directing plans and conducting national\r\nwars against monarchs. Having therefore the young king entirely in\r\nhis power, owing to his age, he set out; and having mustered the army\r\nat Apameia he started thence and arrived at Laodiceia. Advancing from\r\nthat time with his whole army, the king crossed the desert and entered\r\nthe cañon called Marsyas, which lies between the skirts of Libanus\r\nand Anti-Libanus, and is contracted into a narrow gorge by those two\r\nmountains. Just where the valley is narrowest it is divided by marshes\r\nand lakes, from which the scented reed is cut.\r\n\r\n+46.+ On one side of the entrance to this pass lies a place called\r\nBrochi, on the other Gerrha, which leave but a narrow space between\r\nthem. After a march of several days through this cañon, and subduing\r\nthe towns that lay along it, Antiochus arrived at Gerrha. Finding that\r\nTheodotus the Aetolian had already occupied Gerrha and Brochi, and had\r\nsecured the narrow road by the lakes with ditches and palisades and a\r\nproper disposition of guards, the king at first tried to carry the pass\r\nby force; but after sustaining more loss than he inflicted, and finding\r\nthat Theodotus remained still stanch, he gave up the attempt. In the\r\nmidst of these difficulties news was brought that Xenoetas had suffered\r\na total defeat and that Molon was in possession of all the upper\r\ncountry: he therefore abandoned his foreign expedition and started to\r\nrelieve his own dominions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Xenoetas at first successful.]\r\n\r\nThe fact was that when the general Xenoetas had been despatched with\r\nabsolute powers, as I have before stated, his unexpected elevation\r\ncaused him to treat his friends with haughtiness and his enemies with\r\noverweening temerity. His first move however was sufficiently prudent.\r\nHe marched to Seleucia, and after sending for Diogenes the governor of\r\nSusiana, and Pythiades the commander in the Persian Gulf, he led out\r\nhis forces and encamped with the river Tigris protecting his front. But\r\nthere he was visited by many men from Molon’s camp, who swam across\r\nthe river and assured him that, if he would only cross the Tigris, the\r\nwhole of Molon’s army would declare for him; for the common soldiers\r\nwere jealous of Molon and warmly disposed towards the king. Xenoetas\r\nwas encouraged by these statements to attempt the passage of the\r\nTigris. He made a feint of bridging the river at a spot where it is\r\ndivided by an island; but as he was getting nothing ready for such an\r\noperation, Molon took no notice of his pretended move; while he was\r\nreally occupied in collecting boats and getting them ready with every\r\npossible care. Then having selected the most courageous men, horse and\r\nfoot, from his entire army, he left Zeuxis and Pythiades in charge of\r\nhis camp, and marched up stream at night about eighty stades above\r\nMolon’s camp; and having got his force safely over in boats, encamped\r\nthem before daybreak in an excellent position, nearly surrounded by the\r\nriver, and covered where there was no river by marshes and swamps.\r\n\r\n+47.+ When Molon learnt what had taken place, he sent his cavalry,\r\nunder the idea that they would easily stop those who were actually\r\ncrossing, and ride down those who had already crossed. But as soon as\r\nthey got near Xenoetas’s force, their ignorance of the ground proved\r\nfatal to them without any enemy to attack them; for they got immersed\r\nby their own weight, and sinking in the lakes were all rendered\r\nuseless, while many of them actually lost their lives. Xenoetas,\r\nhowever, feeling sure that if he only approached, Molon’s forces would\r\nall desert to him, advanced along the bank of the river and pitched\r\na camp close to the enemy. Thereupon Molon, either as a stratagem,\r\nor because he really felt some doubt of the fidelity of his men, and\r\nwas afraid that some of Xenoetas’s expectations might be fulfilled,\r\nleft his baggage in his camp and started under cover of night in the\r\ndirection of Media. Xenoetas, imagining that Molon had fled in terror\r\nat his approach, and because he distrusted the fidelity of his own\r\ntroops, first attacked and took the enemy’s camp, and then sent for\r\nhis own cavalry and their baggage from the camp of Zeuxis. He next\r\nsummoned the soldiers to a meeting, and told them that they should feel\r\nencouraged and hopeful now that Molon had fled. With this preface,\r\nhe ordered them all to attend to their bodily wants and refresh\r\nthemselves; as he intended without delay to go in pursuit of the enemy\r\nearly next morning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon returns to his camp.]\r\n\r\n+48.+ But the soldiers, filled with confidence, and enriched with\r\nevery kind of provisions, eagerly turned to feasting and wine and the\r\ndemoralisation which always accompanies such excesses. But Molon,\r\nafter marching a considerable distance, caused his army to get their\r\ndinner, and then wheeling round reappeared at the camp. He found all\r\nthe enemy scattered about and drunk, and attacked their palisade just\r\nbefore daybreak. Dismayed by this unexpected danger, and unable to\r\nawake his men from their drunken slumber, Xenoetas and his staff rushed\r\nfuriously upon the enemy and were killed. Of the sleeping soldiers most\r\nwere killed in their beds, while the rest threw themselves into the\r\nriver and endeavoured to cross to the opposite camp. The greater part\r\nhowever even of these perished; for in the blind hurry and confusion\r\nwhich prevailed, and in the universal panic and dismay, seeing the camp\r\non the other side divided by so narrow a space, they all forgot the\r\nviolence of the stream, and the difficulty of crossing it, in their\r\neagerness to reach a place of safety. In wild excitement therefore,\r\nand with a blind instinct of self-preservation, they not only hurled\r\nthemselves into the river, but threw their beasts of burden in also,\r\nwith their packs, as though they thought that the river by some\r\nprovidential instinct would take their part and convey them safely to\r\nthe opposite camp. The result was that the stream presented a truly\r\npitiable and extraordinary spectacle,—horses, beasts of burden, arms,\r\ncorpses, and every kind of baggage being carried down the current along\r\nwith the swimmers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon’s successful campaign. B.C. 221.]\r\n\r\nHaving secured the camp of Xenoetas, Molon crossed the river in perfect\r\nsafety and without any resistance, as Zeuxis also now fled at his\r\napproach; took possession of the latter’s camp, and then advanced with\r\nhis whole army to Seleucia; carried it at the first assault, Zeuxis and\r\nDiomedon the governor of the place both abandoning it and flying; and\r\nadvancing from this place reduced the upper Satrapies to submission\r\nwithout a blow. That of Babylon fell next, and then the Satrapy which\r\nlay along the Persian Gulf. This brought him to Susa, which he also\r\ncarried without a blow; though his assaults upon the citadel proved\r\nunavailing, because Diogenes the general had thrown himself into it\r\nbefore he could get there. He therefore abandoned the idea of carrying\r\nit by storm, and leaving a detachment to lay siege to it, hurried back\r\nwith his main army to Seleucia on the Tigris. There he took great pains\r\nto refresh his army, and after addressing his men in encouraging terms\r\nhe started once more to complete his designs, and occupied Parapotamia\r\nas far as the city Europus, and Mesopotamia as far as Dura.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Epigenes put to death by the intrigues of Hermeias.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ When news of these events was brought to Antiochus, as I have\r\nsaid before, he gave up all idea of the Coele-Syrian campaign, and\r\nturned all his attention to this war. Another meeting of his council\r\nwas thereupon summoned: and on the king ordering the members of it to\r\ndeliver their opinions as to the tactics to be employed against Molon,\r\nthe first to speak on the business was again Epigenes: who said that\r\n“his advice should have been followed all along, and measures have been\r\npromptly taken before the enemy had obtained such important successes:\r\nstill even at this late hour they ought to take it in hand resolutely.”\r\nThereupon Hermeias broke out again into an unreasonable and violent fit\r\nof anger and began to heap abuse upon Epigenes; and while belauding\r\nhimself in a fulsome manner, brought accusations against Epigenes that\r\nwere absurd as well as false. He ended by adjuring the king not to be\r\ndiverted from his purpose without better reason, nor to abandon his\r\nhopes in Coele-Syria. This advice was ill-received by the majority of\r\nthe council, and displeasing to Antiochus himself; and, accordingly,\r\nas the king showed great anxiety to reconcile the two men, Hermeias\r\nwas at length induced to put an end to his invectives. The council\r\ndecided by a majority that the course recommended by Epigenes was the\r\nmost practical and advantageous, and a resolution was come to that the\r\nking should go on the campaign against Molon, and devote his attention\r\nto that. Thereupon Hermeias promptly made a hypocritical pretence of\r\nhaving changed his mind and remarking that it was the duty of all to\r\nacquiesce loyally in the decision, made a great show of readiness and\r\nactivity in pushing on the preparations.\r\n\r\n+50.+ The forces, however, having been mustered at Apameia, upon a kind\r\nof mutiny arising among the common soldiers, on account of some arrears\r\nof pay, Hermeias, observing the king to be in a state of anxiety, and\r\nto be alarmed at the disturbance at so critical a moment, offered to\r\ndischarge all arrears, if the king would only consent to Epigenes\r\nnot accompanying the expedition; on the ground that nothing could be\r\nproperly managed in the army when such angry feelings, and such party\r\nspirit, had been excited. The proposal was very displeasing to the\r\nking, who was exceedingly anxious that Epigenes should accompany him on\r\nthe campaign, owing to his experience in the field; but he was bound\r\nso completely hand and foot, and entangled by the craft of Hermeias,\r\nhis skilful finance, constant watchfulness, and designing flattery,\r\nthat he was not his own master; and accordingly he yielded to the\r\nnecessity of the moment and consented to his demand. When Epigenes\r\nthereupon retired, as he was bidden, the members of the council were\r\ntoo much afraid of incurring displeasure to remonstrate; while the\r\narmy generally, by a revulsion of feeling, turned with gratitude to\r\nthe man to whom they owed the settlement of their claims for pay. The\r\nCyrrhestae were the only ones that stood out: and they broke out into\r\nopen mutiny, and for some time occasioned much trouble; but, being\r\nat last conquered by one of the king’s generals, most of them were\r\nkilled, and the rest submitted to the king’s mercy. Hermeias having\r\nthus secured the allegiance of his friends by fear, and of the troops\r\nby being of service to them, started on the expedition in company with\r\nthe king; while in regard to Epigenes he elaborated the following plot,\r\nwith the assistance of Alexis, the commander of the citadel of Apameia.\r\nHe wrote a letter purporting to have been sent from Molon to Epigenes,\r\nand persuaded one of the latter’s servants, by holding out the hope of\r\ngreat rewards, to take it to the house of Epigenes, and mix it with his\r\nother papers. Immediately after this had been done, Alexis came to the\r\nhouse and asked Epigenes whether he had not received certain letters\r\nfrom Molon; and, upon his denial, demanded in menacing terms to be\r\nallowed to search. Having entered, he quickly discovered the letter,\r\nwhich he availed himself of as a pretext for putting Epigenes to death\r\non the spot. By this means the king was persuaded to believe that\r\nEpigenes had justly forfeited his life; and though the courtiers had\r\ntheir suspicions, they were afraid to say anything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 221-220. Antiochus advances through Mesopotamia.]\r\n\r\n+51.+ When Antiochus had reached the Euphrates, and had taken over the\r\nforce stationed there, he once more started on his march and got as far\r\nas Antioch, in Mygdonia, about mid-winter, and there remained until the\r\nworst of the winter should be over. Thence after a stay of forty days\r\nhe advanced to Libba. Molon was now in the neighbourhood of Babylon:\r\nand Antiochus consulted his council as to the route to be pursued,\r\nthe tactics to be adopted, and the source from which provisions could\r\nbest be obtained for his army on the march in their expedition against\r\nMolon. The proposal of Hermeias was to march along the Tigris, with\r\nthis river, and the Lycus and Caprus, on their flank. Zeuxis, having\r\nthe fate of Epigenes before his eyes, was in a state of painful doubt\r\nwhether to speak his real opinion or no; but as the mistake involved\r\nin the advice of Hermeias was flagrant, he at last mustered courage\r\nto advise that the Tigris should be crossed; alleging as a reason the\r\ngeneral difficulty of the road along the river: especially from the\r\nfact that, after a considerable march, the last six days of which\r\nwould be through a desert, they would reach what was called the\r\n“King’s Dyke,” which it would be impossible to cross if they found it\r\ninvested by the enemy; while a retirement by a second march through\r\nthe wilderness would be manifestly dangerous, especially as their\r\nprovisions would be sure to be running short. On the other hand he\r\nshowed that if they crossed the Tigris it was evident the Apolloniates\r\nwould repent of their treason and join the king; for even as it was\r\nthey had submitted to Molon, not from choice, but under compulsion\r\nand terror; and the fertility of their soil promised abundance of\r\nprovisions for the troops. But his most weighty argument was that by\r\ntheir thus acting Molon would be cut off from a return to Media, and\r\nfrom drawing supplies from that country, and would thereby be compelled\r\nto risk a general action: or, if he refused to do so, his troops would\r\npromptly fix their hopes upon the king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus crosses the Tigris.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ The suggestion of Zeuxis being approved, the army was immediately\r\narranged in three divisions, and got across with the baggage at three\r\npoints in the river. Thence they marched in the direction of Dura,\r\nwhere they quickly caused the siege of the citadel to be raised, which\r\nwas being invested at the time by some of Molon’s officers; and thence,\r\nafter a march of eight successive days, they crossed the mountain\r\ncalled Oreicum and arrived at Apollonia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon also crosses the Tigris.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abortive attempt of Molon to make a night attack on the\r\nking.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Molon had heard of the king’s arrival, and not feeling\r\nconfidence in the inhabitants of Susiana and Babylonia, because he\r\nhad conquered them so recently and by surprise, fearing also to be\r\ncut off from a retreat to Media, he determined to throw a bridge over\r\nthe Tigris and get his army across; being eager if it were possible\r\nto secure the mountain district of Apollonia, because he had great\r\nconfidence in his corps of slingers called Cyrtii. He carried out his\r\nresolution, and was pushing forward in an unbroken series of forced\r\nmarches. Thus it came about that, just as he was entering the district\r\nof Apollonia, the king at the head of his whole army was marching out.\r\nThe advanced guard of skirmishers of the two armies fell in with each\r\nother on some high ground, and at first engaged and made trial of each\r\nother’s strength; but upon the main armies on either side coming on\r\nto the ground, they separated. For the present both retired to their\r\nrespective entrenchments, and encamped at a distance of forty stades\r\nfrom each other. When night had fallen, Molon reflected that there\r\nwas some risk and disadvantage in a battle by broad daylight and in\r\nthe open field between rebels and their sovereign, and he determined\r\ntherefore to attack Antiochus by night. Selecting the best and most\r\nvigorous of his soldiers, he made a considerable détour, with the\r\nobject of making his attack from higher ground. But having learnt\r\nduring his march that ten young men had deserted in a body to the king,\r\nhe gave up his design, and facing right about returned in haste to his\r\nown entrenchment where he arrived about daybreak. His arrival caused a\r\npanic in the army; for the troops in the camp, startled out of their\r\nsleep by the arrival of the returning men, were very near rushing out\r\nof the lines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disposition of the king’s army.]\r\n\r\n+53.+ But while Molon was doing his best to calm the panic, the king,\r\nfully prepared for the engagement, was marching his whole army out of\r\ntheir lines at daybreak. On his right wing he stationed his lancers\r\nunder the command of Ardys, a man of proved ability in the field; next\r\nto them the Cretan allies, and next the Gallic Rhigosages. Next these\r\nhe placed the foreign contingent and mercenary soldiers from Greece,\r\nand next to them he stationed his phalanx: the left wing he assigned to\r\nthe cavalry called the “Companions.”[263] His elephants, which were ten\r\nin number, he placed at intervals in front of the line. His reserves of\r\ninfantry and cavalry he divided between the two wings, with orders to\r\noutflank the enemy as soon as the battle had begun. He then went along\r\nthe line and addressed a few words of exhortation to the men suitable\r\nto the occasion; and put Hermeias and Zeuxis in command of the left\r\nwing, taking that of the right himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Molon’s disposition.]\r\n\r\nOn the other side, owing to the panic caused by his rash movement of\r\nthe previous night, Molon was unable to get his men out of camp, or\r\ninto position without difficulty and confusion. He did however divide\r\nhis cavalry between his two wings, guessing what the disposition of the\r\nenemy would be; and stationed the scutati and Gauls, and in short all\r\nhis heavy-armed men in the space between the two bodies of cavalry. His\r\narchers, slingers, and all such kind of troops he placed on the outer\r\nflank of the cavalry on either wing; while his scythed chariots he\r\nplaced at intervals in front of his line. He gave his brother Neolaus\r\ncommand of the left wing, taking that of the right himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Molon and his fellow-conspirators.]\r\n\r\n+54.+ When the two armies advanced to the battle, Molon’s right wing\r\nremained faithful to him, and vigorously engaged the division of\r\nZeuxis; but the left wing no sooner came within sight of the king than\r\nit deserted to the enemy: the result of which was that Molon’s army was\r\nthrown into consternation, while the king’s troops were inspired with\r\nredoubled confidence. When Molon comprehended what had taken place,\r\nand found himself surrounded on every side, reflecting on the tortures\r\nwhich would be inflicted upon him if he were taken alive, he put an\r\nend to his own life. So too all who had taken part in the plot fled\r\nseverally to their own homes, and terminated their lives in the same\r\nway. Neolaus escaped from the field and found his way into Persis, to\r\nthe house of Molon’s brother Alexander; and there first killed his\r\nmother and Molon’s children and afterwards himself, having previously\r\npersuaded Alexander to do the same to himself. After plundering the\r\nenemy’s camp, the king ordered the body of Molon to be impaled on the\r\nmost conspicuous spot in Media: which the men appointed to the work\r\nimmediately did; for they took it to Callonitis and impaled it close\r\nto the pass over Mount Zagrus. The king, after plundering the enemy’s\r\ncamp, rebuked the rebel army in a long speech; and finally receiving\r\nthem back into favour by holding out his right hand to them, appointed\r\ncertain officers to lead them back to Media and settle the affairs\r\nof that district; while he himself went down to Seleucia and made\r\narrangements for the government of the Satrapies round it, treating\r\nall with equal clemency and prudence. But Hermeias acted with his\r\nusual harshness: he got up charges against the people of Seleucia,\r\nand imposed a fine of a thousand talents upon the city; drove their\r\nmagistrates, called Adeiganes, into exile; and put many Seleucians to\r\ndeath with various tortures, by mutilation, the sword and the rack.\r\nWith great difficulty, sometimes by dissuading Hermeias, and sometimes\r\nby interposing his own authority, the king did at length put an end\r\nto these severities; and, exacting only a fine of a hundred and fifty\r\ntalents from the citizens for the error they had committed, restored\r\nthe city to a state of order. This being done, he left Diogenes in\r\ncommand of Media, and Apollodorus of Susiana; and sent Tychon, his\r\nchief military secretary, to command the district along the Persian\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nThus was the rebellion of Molon and the rising in the upper Satrapies\r\nsuppressed and quieted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extension of the expedition. The treasonable designs of\r\nHermeias.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Artabazanes.]\r\n\r\n+55.+ Elated by his success, and wishing to strike awe and terror\r\ninto the minds of the princes of the barbarians who were near, or\r\nconterminous with his own Satrapies, that they might never venture to\r\naid by supplies or arms those who revolted from him, he determined to\r\nmarch against them. And first of all against Artabazanes, who appeared\r\nto be the most formidable and able of all the princes, and who ruled\r\nover a tribe called the Satrapeii, and others on their borders. But\r\nHermeias was at that time afraid of an expedition further up country,\r\nowing to its danger; and was always yearning for the expedition against\r\nPtolemy in accordance with his original plan. When news, however,\r\ncame that a son had been born to the king, thinking that Antiochus\r\nmight possibly fall by the hands of the barbarians in upper Asia, or\r\ngive him opportunities of putting him out of the way, he consented\r\nto the expedition; believing that, if he could only effect the death\r\nof Antiochus, he would be guardian to his son and so sole master of\r\nthe whole kingdom. This having been decided, the army crossed Mount\r\nZagrus and entered the territory of Artabazanes, which borders on\r\nMedia, and is separated from it by an intervening chain of mountains.\r\nPart of it overlooks the Pontus, near the valley of the Phasis; and\r\nit extends to the Hyrcanian Sea. Its inhabitants are numerous and\r\nwarlike and especially strong in horsemen; while the district produces\r\nwithin itself all other things necessary for war. The dynasty has\r\nlasted from the time of the Persians, having been overlooked at the\r\nperiod of Alexander’s conquests. But now in great alarm at the king’s\r\napproach, and at his own infirmities, for he was an extremely old man,\r\nArtabazanes yielded to the force of circumstances, and made a treaty\r\nwith Antiochus on his own terms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall and death of Hermeias, B.C. 220.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ It was after the settlement of this treaty that Apollophanes,\r\nthe physician, who was regarded with great affection by the king,\r\nobserving that Hermeias was getting beyond all bounds in his high\r\nplace, began to be anxious for the king’s safety, and still more\r\nsuspicious and uneasy for his own. He took an opportunity, therefore,\r\nof conveying a suggestion to the king, that he had better not be too\r\ncareless or unsuspicious of the audacious character of Hermeias; nor\r\nlet things go on until he found himself involved in a disaster like\r\nthat of his brother. “The danger,” he said, “is not at all remote.”\r\nAnd he begged him to be on his guard, and take prompt measures for\r\nthe safety of himself and his friends. Antiochus owned to him that\r\nhe disliked and feared Hermeias; and thanked him for the care of his\r\nperson, which had emboldened him to speak to him on the subject. This\r\nconversation encouraged Apollophanes by convincing him that he had\r\nnot been mistaken about the feelings and opinions of the king; and\r\nAntiochus begged him not to confine his assistance to words, but to\r\ntake some practical steps to secure the safety of himself and his\r\nfriends. Upon Apollophanes replying that he was ready to do anything\r\nin the world, they concerted the following plan. On the pretext of the\r\nking being afflicted with an attack of vertigo, it was given out that\r\nthe daily attendance of courtiers and officials was to be discontinued\r\nfor a few days: the king and his physician thus getting the opportunity\r\nof conferring with such of his friends as he chose, who came on the\r\npretext of visiting him. In the course of these visits suitable persons\r\nfor carrying out the design were prepared and instructed; and every\r\none readily responding to the proposal, from hatred of Hermeias, they\r\nproceeded to complete it. The physicians having prescribed walks at\r\ndaybreak for Antiochus on account of the coolness, Hermeias came to\r\nthe place assigned for the walk, and with him those of the king’s\r\nfriends who were privy to the design; while the rest were much too late\r\non account of the time of the king’s coming out being very different\r\nfrom what it had usually been. Thus they got Hermeias gradually a\r\nconsiderable distance from the camp, until they came to a certain\r\nlonely spot, and then, on the king’s going a little off the road, on\r\nthe pretence of a necessary purpose, they stabbed him to death. Such\r\nwas the end of Hermeias, whose punishment was by no means equal to his\r\ncrimes. Thus freed from much fear and embarrassment, the king set out\r\non his march home amidst universal manifestations from the people of\r\nthe country in favour of his measures and policy; but nothing was more\r\nemphatically applauded in the course of his progress than the removal\r\nof Hermeias. In Apameia, at the same time, the women stoned the wife of\r\nHermeias to death, and the boys his sons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempted treason of Achaeus.]\r\n\r\n+57.+ When he had reached home and had dismissed his troops into\r\nwinter quarters, Antiochus sent a message to Achaeus, protesting\r\nagainst his assumption of the diadem and royal title, and warning him\r\nthat he was aware of his dealings with Ptolemy, and of his restless\r\nintrigues generally. For while the king was engaged on his expedition\r\nagainst Artabazanes, Achaeus, being persuaded that Antiochus would\r\nfall, or that, if he did not fall, would be so far off, that it would\r\nbe possible for him to invade Syria before his return, and with the\r\nassistance of the Cyrrhestae, who were in revolt against the king,\r\nseize the kingdom, started from Lydia with his whole army; and on\r\narriving at Laodiceia, in Phrygia, assumed the diadem, and had the\r\naudacity for the first time to adopt the title of king, and to send\r\nroyal despatches to the cities, the exile Garsyeris being his chief\r\nadviser in this measure. But as he advanced farther and farther, and\r\nwas now almost at Lycaonia, a mutiny broke out among his forces,\r\narising from the dissatisfaction of the men at the idea of being led\r\nagainst their natural king. When Achaeus found that this disturbed\r\nstate of feeling existed among them, he desisted from his enterprise;\r\nand wishing to make his men believe that he had never had any intention\r\nof invading Syria, he directed his march into Pisidia, and plundered\r\nthe country. By thus securing large booty for his army he conciliated\r\nits affection and confidence, and then returned to his own Satrapy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Ptolemy, B.C. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Apollophanes advises that they begin by taking Seleucia.]\r\n\r\n+58.+ Every detail of these transactions was known to the king:\r\nwho, while sending frequent threatening messages to Achaeus, was\r\nnow concentrating all his efforts on the preparations for the war\r\nagainst Ptolemy. Having accordingly mustered his forces at Apameia\r\njust before spring, he summoned his friends to advise with him as to\r\nthe invasion of Coele-Syria. After many suggestions had been made in\r\nrespect to this undertaking, touching the nature of the country, the\r\nmilitary preparation required, and the assistance to be rendered by the\r\nfleet,—Apollophanes of Seleucia, whom I mentioned before, put an abrupt\r\nend to all these suggestions by remarking that “it was folly to desire\r\nCoele-Syria and to march against that, while they allowed Seleucia to\r\nbe held by Ptolemy, which was the capital, and so to speak, the very\r\ninner shrine of the king’s realm. Besides the disgrace to the kingdom\r\nwhich its occupation by the Egyptian monarchs involved, it was a\r\nposition of the greatest practical importance, as a most admirable base\r\nof operations. Occupied by the enemy it was of the utmost hindrance\r\nto all the king’s designs; for in whatever direction he might have it\r\nin his mind to move his forces, his own country, owing to the fear\r\nof danger from this place, would need as much care and precaution\r\nas the preparations against his foreign enemies. Once taken, on the\r\nother hand, not only would it perfectly secure the safety of the home\r\ndistrict, but was also capable of rendering effective aid to the king’s\r\nother designs and undertakings, whether by land or sea, owing to its\r\ncommanding situation.” His words carried conviction to the minds of\r\nall, and it was resolved that the capture of the town should be their\r\nfirst step. For Seleucia was still held by a garrison for the Egyptian\r\nkings; and had been so since the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, who took it\r\nwhen he invaded Syria to revenge the murder of Berenice.\r\n\r\n+59.+ In consequence of this decision, orders were sent to Diognetus\r\nthe commander of the fleet to sail towards Seleucia: while Antiochus\r\nhimself started from Apameia with his army, and encamped near the\r\nHippodrome, about five stades from the town. He also despatched\r\nTheodotus Hemiolius with an adequate force against Coele-Syria, with\r\norders to occupy the passes and to keep the road open for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of Seleucia.]\r\n\r\nThe situation of Seleucia and the natural features of the surrounding\r\ncountry are of this kind. The city stands on the sea coast between\r\nCilicia and Phoenicia; and has close to it a very great mountain called\r\nCoryphaeus, which on the west is washed by the last waves of the sea\r\nwhich lies between Cyprus and Phoenicia; while its eastern slopes\r\noverlook the territories of Antioch and Seleucia. It is on the southern\r\nskirt of this mountain that the town of Seleucia lies, separated from\r\nit by a deep and difficult ravine. The town extends down to the sea\r\nin a straggling line broken by irregularities of the soil, and is\r\nsurrounded on most parts by cliffs and precipitous rocks. On the side\r\nfacing the sea, where the ground is level, stand the market-places, and\r\nthe lower town strongly walled. Similarly the whole of the main town\r\nhas been fortified by walls of a costly construction, and splendidly\r\ndecorated with temples and other elaborate buildings. There is only\r\none approach to it on the seaward side, which is an artificial ascent\r\ncut in the form of a stair, interrupted by frequently occurring drops\r\nand awkward places. Not far from the town is the mouth of the river\r\nOrontes, which rises in the district of Libanus and Anti-Libanus, and\r\nafter traversing the plain of Amyca reaches Antioch; through which it\r\nflows, and carrying off by the force of its current all the sewage\r\nof that town, finally discharges itself into this sea not far from\r\nSeleucia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capture of Seleucia.]\r\n\r\n+60.+ Antiochus first tried sending messages to the magistrates of\r\nSeleucia, offering money and other rewards on condition of having the\r\ncity surrendered without fighting. And though he failed to persuade the\r\nchief authorities, he corrupted some of the subordinate commanders;\r\nand relying on them, he made preparations to assault the town on the\r\nseaward side with the men of his fleet, and on the land side with\r\nhis soldiers. He divided his forces therefore into three parts, and\r\naddressed suitable words of exhortation to them, causing a herald to\r\nproclaim a promise to men and officers alike of great gifts and crowns\r\nthat should be bestowed for gallantry in action. To the division under\r\nZeuxis he entrusted the attack upon the gate leading to Antioch; to\r\nHermogenes that upon the walls near the temple of Castor and Pollux;\r\nand to Ardys and Diognetus the assault upon the docks and the lower\r\ntown: in accordance with his understanding with his partisans in the\r\ntown, whereby it had been agreed that, if he could carry the lower\r\ntown by assault, the city also should then be put into his hands. When\r\nthe signal was given, a vigorous and determined assault was begun\r\nsimultaneously at all these points: though that made by Ardys and\r\nDiognetus was by far the most daring; for the other points did not\r\nadmit of any assault at all by means of scaling ladders, nor could\r\nbe carried except by the men climbing up on their hands and knees;\r\nwhile at the docks and lower town it was possible to apply scaling\r\nladders and fix them firmly and safely against the walls. The naval\r\ncontingent therefore having fixed their ladders on the docks, and the\r\ndivision of Ardys theirs upon the lower town, a violent effort was\r\nmade to carry the walls: and the garrison of the upper town being\r\nprevented from coming to the assistance of these places, because the\r\ncity was being assaulted at every other point at the same time, Ardys\r\nwas not long before he captured the lower town. No sooner had this\r\nfallen, than the subordinate officers who had been corrupted hurried\r\nto the commander-in-chief Leontius, and urged that he ought to send\r\nambassadors to Antiochus, and make terms with him, before the city was\r\ntaken by storm. Knowing nothing about the treason of these officers,\r\nbut alarmed by their consternation, Leontius sent commissioners to the\r\nking to make terms for the safety of all within the city.\r\n\r\n+61.+ The king accepted the proposal and agreed to grant safety to\r\nall in the town who were free, amounting to six thousand souls. And\r\nwhen he took over the town, he not only spared the free, but also\r\nrecalled those of the inhabitants who had been exiled, and restored to\r\nthem their citizenship and property; while he secured the harbour and\r\ncitadel with garrisons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Theodotus turns against Ptolemy. See ch. 46.]\r\n\r\nWhile still engaged in this business, he received a letter from\r\nTheodotus offering to put Coele-Syria into his hands, and inviting\r\nhim to come thither with all speed. This letter caused him great\r\nembarrassment and doubt as to what he ought to do, and how best to\r\ntake advantage of the offer. This Theodotus was an Aetolian who, as I\r\nhave already narrated, had rendered important services to Ptolemy’s\r\nkingdom: for which, far from being reckoned deserving of gratitude, he\r\nhad been in imminent danger of his life, just about the time of the\r\nexpedition of Antiochus against Molon. Thereupon conceiving a contempt\r\nfor Ptolemy, and a distrust of his courtiers, he seized upon Ptolemais\r\nwith his own hands, and upon Tyre by the agency of Panaetolus, and made\r\nhaste to invite Antiochus. Postponing therefore his expedition against\r\nAchaeus, and regarding everything else as of secondary importance,\r\nAntiochus started with his army by the same route as he had come. After\r\npassing the cañon called Marsyas, he encamped near Gerrha, close to the\r\nlake which lies between the two mountains. Hearing there that Ptolemy’s\r\ngeneral Nicolaus was besieging Theodotus in Ptolemais, he left his\r\nheavy-armed troops behind with orders to their leaders to besiege\r\nBrochi,—the stronghold which commands the road along the lake,—and led\r\nhis light-armed troops forward himself, with the intention of raising\r\nthe siege of Ptolemais. But Nicolaus had already got intelligence\r\nof the king’s approach; and had accordingly retired from Ptolemais\r\nhimself, and sent forward Diogoras the Cretan and Dorymenes the\r\nAetolian to occupy the passes at Berytus. The king therefore attacked\r\nthese men, and having easily routed them took up a position near the\r\npass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus invades Coele-Syria.]\r\n\r\n+62.+ There he awaited the coming up of the remainder of his forces,\r\nand, after addressing them in words befitting the occasion, continued\r\nhis advance with his entire army, full of courage and with high\r\nhopes of success. When Theodotus and Panaetolus met him with their\r\npartisans he received them graciously, and took over from them Tyre\r\nand Ptolemais, and the war material which those cities contained. Part\r\nof this consisted of forty vessels, of which twenty were decked and\r\nsplendidly equipped, and none with less than four banks of oars; the\r\nother twenty were made up of triremes, biremes, and cutters. These he\r\nhanded over to the care of the Navarch Diognetus; and being informed\r\nthat Ptolemy had come out against him, and had reached Memphis, and\r\nthat all his forces were collected at Pelusium, and were opening the\r\nsluices, and filling up the wells of drinking water, he abandoned the\r\nidea of attacking Pelusium; but making a progress through the several\r\ncities, endeavoured to win them over by force or persuasion to his\r\nauthority. Some of the less-fortified cities were overawed at his\r\napproach and made no difficulty about submitting, but others trusting\r\nto their fortifications or the strength of their situations held\r\nout; and to these he was forced to lay regular siege and so wasted a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nThough treated with such flagrant perfidy, the character of Ptolemy was\r\nso feeble, and his neglect of all military preparations had been so\r\ngreat, that the idea of protecting his rights with the sword, which was\r\nhis most obvious duty, never occurred to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Active measures of Agathocles and Sosibius.]\r\n\r\n+63.+ Agathocles and Sosibius, however, the leading ministers in the\r\nkingdom at that time, took counsel together and did the best they could\r\nwith the means at their disposal, in view of the existing crisis.\r\nThey resolved to devote themselves to the preparations for war; and,\r\nmeanwhile, by embassies to try to retard the advance of Antiochus:\r\npretending to confirm him in the opinion he originally entertained\r\nabout Ptolemy, namely, that he would not venture to fight, but would\r\ntrust to negotiations, and the interposition of common friends, to\r\ninduce him to evacuate Coele-Syria. Having determined upon this policy,\r\nAgathocles and Sosibius, to whom the whole business was entrusted, lost\r\nno time in sending their ambassadors to Antiochus: and at the same time\r\nthey sent messages to Rhodes, Byzantium, and Cyzicus, not omitting the\r\nAetolians, inviting them to send commissioners to discuss the terms of\r\na treaty. The commissioners duly arrived, and by occupying the time\r\nwith going backwards and forwards between the two kings, abundantly\r\nsecured to these statesmen the two things which they wanted,—delay, and\r\ntime to make their preparations for war. They fixed their residence\r\nat Memphis and there carried on these negotiations continuously. Nor\r\nwere they less attentive to the ambassadors from Antiochus, whom they\r\nreceived with every mark of courtesy and kindness. But meanwhile they\r\nwere calling up and collecting at Alexandria the mercenaries whom\r\nthey had on service in towns outside Egypt; were despatching men to\r\nrecruit foreign soldiers; and were collecting provisions both for the\r\ntroops they already possessed, and for those that were coming in.\r\nNo less active were they in every other department of the military\r\npreparations. They took turns in going on rapid and frequent visits to\r\nAlexandria, to see that the supplies should in no point be inadequate\r\nto the undertaking before them. The manufacture of arms, the selection\r\nof men, and their division into companies, they committed to the care\r\nof Echecrates of Thessaly and Phoxidas of Melita. With these they\r\nassociated Eurylochus of Magnesia, and Socrates of Boeotia, who were\r\nalso joined by Cnopias of Allaria. By the greatest good fortune they\r\nhad got hold of these officers, who, while serving with Demetrius and\r\nAntigonus,[264] had acquired some experience of real war and actual\r\nservice in the field. Accordingly they took command of the assembled\r\ntroops, and made the best of them by giving them the training of\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reorganisation of the army.]\r\n\r\n+64.+ Their first measure was to divide them according to their country\r\nand age, and to assign to each division its appropriate arms, taking\r\nno account of what they had borne before. Next they broke up their\r\nbattalions and muster-rolls, which had been formed on the basis of\r\ntheir old system of pay, and formed them into companies adapted to\r\nthe immediate purpose. Having effected this they began to drill the\r\nmen; habituating them severally not only to obey the words of command,\r\nbut also to the proper management of their weapons.[265] They also\r\nfrequently summoned general meetings at headquarters, and delivered\r\nspeeches to the men. The most useful in this respect were Andromachus\r\nof Aspendus and Polycrates of Argos; because they had recently crossed\r\nfrom Greece, and were still thoroughly imbued with the Greek spirit,\r\nand the military ideas prevalent in the several states. Moreover, they\r\nwere illustrious on the score of their private wealth, as well as on\r\nthat of their respective countries; to which advantages Polycrates\r\nadded those of an ancient family, and of the reputation obtained by\r\nhis father Mnasiades as an athlete. By private and public exhortations\r\nthese officers inspired their men with a zeal and enthusiasm for the\r\nstruggle which awaited them.\r\n\r\n+65.+ All these officers, too, had commands in the army suited to\r\ntheir particular accomplishments. Eurylochus of Magnesia commanded\r\nabout three thousand men of what were called in the royal armies the\r\nAgema, or Guard; Socrates of Boeotia had two thousand light-armed\r\ntroops under him; while the Achaean Phoxidas, and Ptolemy the son of\r\nThraseas, and Andromachus of Aspendus were associated in the duty of\r\ndrilling the phalanx and the mercenary Greek soldiers on the same\r\nground,—Andromachus and Ptolemy commanding the phalanx, Phoxidas\r\nthe mercenaries; of which the numbers were respectively twenty-five\r\nthousand and eight thousand. The cavalry, again, attached to the court,\r\namounting to seven hundred, as well as that which was obtained from\r\nLybia or enlisted in the country, were being trained by Polycrates,\r\nand were under his personal command: amounting in all to about three\r\nthousand men. In the actual campaign the most effective service was\r\nperformed by Echecrates of Thessaly, by whom the Greek cavalry, which,\r\nwith the whole body of mercenary cavalry, amounted to two thousand\r\nmen, was splendidly trained. No one took more pains with the men under\r\nhis command than Cnopias of Allaria. He commanded all the Cretans, who\r\nnumbered three thousand, and among them a thousand Neo-Cretans,[266]\r\nover whom he had set Philo of Cnossus. They also armed three thousand\r\nLibyans in the Macedonian fashion, who were commanded by Ammonius of\r\nBarce. The Egyptians themselves supplied twenty thousand soldiers\r\nto the phalanx, and were under the command of Sosibius. A body of\r\nThracians and Gauls was also enrolled, four thousand being taken from\r\nsettlers in the country and their descendants, while two thousand had\r\nbeen recently enlisted and brought over: and these were under the\r\ncommand of Dionysius of Thrace. Such in its numbers, and in the variety\r\nof the elements of which it was composed, was the force which was being\r\ngot ready for Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Negotiations at Memphis, B.C. 219-218.]\r\n\r\n+66.+ Meanwhile Antiochus had been engaged in the siege of Dura:[267]\r\nbut the strength of the place and the support given it by Nicolaus\r\nprevented him from effecting anything; and as the winter was closing\r\nin, he agreed with the ambassadors of Ptolemy to a suspension of\r\nhostilities for four months, and promised that he would discuss the\r\nwhole question at issue in a friendly spirit. But he was as far as\r\npossible from being sincere in this negotiation: his real object was\r\nto avoid being detained any length of time from his own country, and\r\nto be able to place his troops in winter quarters in Seleucia; because\r\nAchaeus was now notoriously plotting against him, and without disguise\r\nco-operating with Ptolemy. So having come to this agreement, Antiochus\r\ndismissed the ambassadors with injunctions to acquaint him as soon as\r\npossible with the decision of Ptolemy, and to meet him at Seleucia. He\r\nthen placed the necessary guards in the various strongholds, committed\r\nto Theodotus the command-in-chief over them all, and returned home. On\r\nhis arrival at Seleucia he distributed his forces into their winter\r\nquarters; and from that time forth took no pains to keep the mass of\r\nhis army under discipline, being persuaded that the business would\r\nnot call for any more fighting; because he was already master of some\r\nportions of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and expected to secure the rest\r\nby voluntary submission or by diplomacy: for Ptolemy, he believed,\r\nwould not venture upon a general engagement. This opinion was shared\r\nalso by the ambassadors: because Sosibius fixing his residence at\r\nMemphis conducted his negotiations with them in a friendly manner;\r\nwhile he prevented those who went backwards and forwards to Antiochus\r\nfrom ever becoming eye-witnesses of the preparations that were being\r\ncarried on at Alexandria. Nay, even by the time that the ambassadors\r\narrived, Sosibius was already prepared for every eventuality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus’s case.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy’s case.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy, son of Lagus, B.C. 323-285.]\r\n\r\n+67.+ Meanwhile Antiochus was extremely anxious to have as much the\r\nadvantage over the government of Alexandria in diplomatic argument as\r\nhe had in arms. Accordingly when the ambassadors arrived at Seleucia,\r\nand both parties began, in accordance with the instructions of\r\nSosibius, to discuss the clauses of the proposed arrangement in detail,\r\nthe king made very light of the loss recently sustained by Ptolemy, and\r\nthe injury which had been manifestly inflicted upon him by the existing\r\noccupation of Coele-Syria; and in the pleadings on this subject he\r\nrefused to look upon this transaction in the light of an injury at all,\r\nalleging that the places belonged to him of right. He asserted that\r\nthe original occupation of the country by Antigonus the One-eyed, and\r\nthe royal authority exercised over it by Seleucus,[268] constituted an\r\nabsolutely decisive and equitable claim, in virtue of which Coele-Syria\r\nbelonged of right to himself and not to Ptolemy; for Ptolemy I. went to\r\nwar with Antigonus with the view of annexing this country, not to his\r\nown government, but to that of Seleucus. But, above all, he pressed the\r\nconvention entered into by the three kings, Cassander, Lysimachus, and\r\nSeleucus, when, after having conquered Antigonus,[269] they deliberated\r\nin common upon the arrangements to be made, and decided that the whole\r\nof Syria should belong to Seleucus. The commissioners of Ptolemy\r\nendeavoured to establish the opposite case. They magnified the existing\r\ninjury, and dilated on its hardship; asserting that the treason of\r\nTheodotus and the invasion of Antiochus amounted to a breach of\r\ntreaty-rights. They alleged the possession of these places in the reign\r\nof Ptolemy, son of Lagus; and tried to show that Ptolemy had joined\r\nSeleucus in the war on the understanding that he was to invest Seleucus\r\nwith the government of the whole of Asia, but was to take Coele-Syria\r\nand Phoenicia for himself.\r\n\r\nSuch were the arguments brought forward by the two contracting parties\r\nin the course of the embassies and counter-embassies and conferences.\r\nThere was no prospect, however, of arriving at any result, because the\r\ncontroversy was conducted, not by the principals, but by the common\r\nfriends of both; and there was no one to intervene authoritatively to\r\ncheck and control the caprice of the party which they might decide to\r\nbe in the wrong. But what caused the most insuperable difficulty was\r\nthe matter of Achaeus. For Ptolemy was eager that the terms of the\r\ntreaty should include him: while Antiochus would not allow the subject\r\nto be so much as mentioned; and was indignant that Ptolemy should\r\nventure to protect rebels, or bring such a point into the discussion at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Renewal of hostilities, B.C. 218.]\r\n\r\n+68.+ The approach of spring found both sides weary of negotiations,\r\nand with no prospect of coming to a conclusion. Antiochus therefore\r\nbegan collecting his forces, with a view of making an invasion by\r\nland and sea, and completing his conquest of Coele-Syria. On his part\r\nPtolemy gave the supreme management of the war to Nicolaus, sent\r\nabundant provisions to Gaza, and despatched land and sea forces. The\r\narrival of these reinforcements gave Nicolaus courage to enter upon\r\nthe war: the commander of the navy promptly co-operating with him in\r\ncarrying out all his orders. This admiral was Perigenes, whom Ptolemy\r\nsent out in command of the fleet, consisting of thirty fully decked\r\nships and more than four thousand ships of burden. Nicolaus was by\r\nbirth an Aetolian, and was the boldest and most experienced officer\r\nin the service of Ptolemy. With one division of his army he hastened\r\nto seize the pass at Platanus; with the rest, which he personally\r\ncommanded, he occupied the environs of Porphyrion; and there prepared\r\nto resist the invasion of the king: the fleet being also anchored close\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus marches to Beirût.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Antiochus had advanced as far as Marathus. On his way he had\r\nreceived a deputation of Aradians, asking for an alliance; and had\r\nnot only granted their request, but had put an end to a quarrel which\r\nthey had amongst themselves, by reconciling those of them who lived\r\non the island with those who lived on the mainland. Starting from\r\nMarathus he entered the enemy’s country near the promontory called\r\nTheoprosopon, and advanced to Berytus, having seized Botrys on his way,\r\nand burnt Trieres and Calamus. From Berytus he sent forward Nicarchus\r\nand Theodotus with orders to secure the difficult passes near the river\r\nLyons; while he himself set his army in motion and encamped near the\r\nriver Damuras: Diognetus, the commander of his navy, coasting along\r\nparallel with him all the while. Thence once more, taking with him the\r\ndivisions commanded by Theodotus and Nicarchus, which were the light\r\ntroops of the army, he set out to reconnoitre the pass occupied already\r\nby Nicolaus. After thoroughly surveying the nature of the ground,\r\nhe retired to his camp for that day. But on the next, leaving his\r\nheavy-armed troops in the charge of Nicarchus, he set out with the rest\r\nof his forces to execute his design.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The pass at Porphyrion.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: carried by Antiochus.]\r\n\r\n+69.+ At this point there is but a small and narrow space between\r\nthe foot of Libanus and the sea; and even that is intersected by a\r\nsteep and rugged spur, leaving only a narrow and difficult passage\r\nalong the very water’s edge. On this pass Nicolaus had taken up his\r\nposition; and having occupied some of the points by means of his large\r\nnumbers, and secured others by artificial works, he felt certain that\r\nhe would be able to prevent Antiochus from effecting an entrance. But\r\nthe king divided his army into three parts, of which he entrusted one\r\nto Theodotus with orders to close with the enemy and force their way\r\nalong the skirts of Libanus; the second to Menedemus with urgent orders\r\nto attempt the centre of the spur; while the third he put under the\r\ncommand of Diocles, the military governor of Parapotamia, and ordered\r\nthem to keep close to the sea. He himself with his guard occupied a\r\ncentral position, intending to superintend the whole action and give\r\nhelp where it was wanted. At the same time Diognetus and Perigenes\r\nmade preparations for a sea-fight, coming as close as possible to the\r\nshore, and endeavouring to make the battles at sea and on land present\r\nthe appearance of a single contest. A general advance having begun by\r\nsea and land, at the same signal and word of command, the battle on the\r\nsea was undecided, because the number of vessels on either side and\r\ntheir equipment were about equal: but on land the troops of Nicolaus\r\ngot the best of it at first, from the advantage of their position.\r\nBut when Theodotus routed the men on the mountain skirts, and then\r\ncharged from the higher ground, Nicolaus’s men all turned and fled\r\nprecipitately. In this flight two thousand of them fell, and as many\r\nwere taken prisoners: the rest retreated towards Sidon. Though he now\r\nhad the better prospect of the two in the sea-fight; yet, when he saw\r\nthe defeat of the army on land, Perigenes turned his prows and made\r\ngood his retreat to the same place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The advance of Antiochus continued.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philoteria.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scythopolis.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atabyrium.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defections from Ptolemy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pella, Camus, Gephrus.]\r\n\r\n+70.+ Thereupon Antiochus got his army on the march, and, arriving at\r\nSidon, encamped under its wall. He did not however venture to attempt\r\nthe town, because of the vast stores it contained and the number of\r\nits ordinary inhabitants, as well as of the refugees who had collected\r\nthere. He therefore broke up his camp again, and continued his march\r\ntowards Philoteria: ordering Diognetus his navarch to sail back with\r\nhis ships to Tyre. Now Philoteria is situated right upon the shores\r\nof the lake into which the river Jordan discharges itself, and from\r\nwhich it issues out again into the plains surrounding Scythopolis. The\r\nsurrender of these two cities to him encouraged him to prosecute his\r\nfurther designs; because the country subject to them was easily able to\r\nsupply his whole army with provisions, and everything necessary for the\r\ncampaign in abundance. Having therefore secured them by garrisons, he\r\ncrossed the mountain chain and arrived at Atabyrium, which is situated\r\nupon a rounded hill, the ascent of which is more than fifteen stades\r\nlong. But on this occasion he managed to take it by an ambuscade and\r\nstratagem. He induced the men of the town to come out to a skirmish,\r\nand enticed their leading columns to a considerable distance; then\r\nhis troops suddenly turned from their pretended flight, and those who\r\nwere concealed rising from their ambush, he attacked and killed a\r\nlarge number of the enemy; and finally, by pursuing close upon their\r\nheels, and thus creating a panic in the town before he reached it, he\r\ncarried it as he had done others by assault. At this juncture Ceraeas,\r\none of Ptolemy’s officers, deserted to Antiochus, whose distinguished\r\nreception caused great excitement in the minds of many other of the\r\nenemy’s officers. At any rate, not long afterwards, Hippolochus of\r\nThessaly joined Antiochus with four hundred cavalry of Ptolemy’s army.\r\nHaving therefore secured Atabyrium also with a garrison, Antiochus\r\nstarted once more and took over Pella, Camus, and Gephrus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abila.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gadara.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rabbatamana.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Rabbatamana.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Samaria.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus goes into winter quarters, B.C. 218-217.]\r\n\r\n+71.+ This unbroken stream of success caused the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbouring Arabia to rouse each other up to take action; and they\r\nunanimously joined Antiochus. With the additional encouragement and\r\nsupplies which they afforded he continued his advance; and, arriving\r\nin the district of Galatis, made himself master of Abila, and the\r\nrelieving force which had thrown itself into that town, under the\r\ncommand of Nicias, a friend and kinsman of Menneas. Gadara was the\r\nonly town now left, which is thought to be the strongest of any in\r\nthose parts. He therefore encamped under its walls and, bringing\r\nsiege-works to bear upon it, quickly terrified it into submission.\r\nThen hearing that a strong force of the enemy were concentrated at\r\nRabbatamana in Arabia, and were pillaging and overrunning the territory\r\nof those Arabians who had joined him, he threw everything else aside\r\nand started thither; and pitched his camp at the foot of the high\r\nground on which that city stands. After going round and reconnoitring\r\nthe hill, and finding that it admitted of being ascended only at two\r\npoints, he led his army to them and set up his siege artillery at these\r\npoints. He put one set of siege-works under the care of Nicarchus, the\r\nother under that of Theodotus: while he superintended both equally,\r\nand observed the zeal shown by the two respectively. Great exertions\r\nwere accordingly made by each, and a continual rivalry kept up as\r\nto which should be the first to make a breach in the wall opposite\r\ntheir works: and the result was that both breaches were made with\r\nunexpected rapidity; whereupon they kept making assaults night and\r\nday, and trying every means to force an entrance, without an hour’s\r\nintermission. But though they kept up these attempts continuously,\r\nthey failed to make any impression; until a prisoner showed them the\r\nunderground passage through which the besieged were accustomed to\r\ndescend to fetch water. They broke into this and stopped it up with\r\ntimber and stones and everything of that sort; and when this was done,\r\nthe garrison surrendered for want of water. Having thus got possession\r\nof Rabbatamana, Antiochus left Nicarchus with an adequate garrison in\r\ncommand of it; and sent the two deserters from Ptolemy, Hippolochus and\r\nCeraeas, with five thousand infantry, to Samaria: with orders to take\r\nthe government of the district and protect all who submitted to him.\r\nHe then started with his army for Ptolemais, where he was resolved to\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Asia Minor,[270]\r\n\r\n+72.+ In the course of this same summer, the Pednelissians, being\r\nbesieged and reduced to great straits by the Selgians, B.C. 218.

Achaeus selected Garsyeris\r\nto conduct the expedition; and sent him out in all haste, with six\r\nthousand infantry and five hundred horse, to relieve the Pednelissians.\r\nBut when they heard of the approach of the army of relief, the Selgians\r\noccupied the pass called the Stair with the main body of their own\r\narmy; and put a garrison at the entrance into Saperda: breaking up\r\nand spoiling all the paths and tracks leading to it. After entering\r\nMilyades and encamping under the walls of Cretopolis, perceiving that\r\na farther advance was made impossible by the occupation of these\r\npositions by the enemy, Garsyeris hit upon the following ruse. He broke\r\nup his camp, and began his return march, as though he had abandoned\r\nall thoughts of relieving Pednelissus, owing to the enemy’s occupation\r\nof these positions. The Selgians were readily persuaded that he had\r\nreally abandoned the relief of Pednelissus, and departed, some to the\r\nbesieging camp and others home to Selge, as it was now close upon\r\nharvest-time. Thereupon Garsyeris faced about, and, marching with great\r\nspeed, arrived at the pass over the mountain; and finding it unguarded,\r\nsecured it by a garrison, under the command of Phayllus; while he\r\nhimself with his main army went to Perga: and thence sent embassies\r\nto the other states in Pisidia and Pamphylia, pointing out that the\r\npower of the Selgians was a standing menace, and urging all to ally\r\nthemselves with Achaeus and join in relieving Pednelissus.\r\n\r\n+73.+ Meanwhile the Selgians had sent out a general in command of\r\na force which they hoped would terrify Phallyus by their superior\r\nknowledge of the country, and expel him from his strong position.\r\nBut when, far from attaining their object, they lost large numbers\r\nof men in their attacks upon him; though they abandoned the hope\r\nof accomplishing this, they yet persisted with increased ardour in\r\nthe siege of Pednelissus. Garsyeris was now reinforced by eight\r\nthousand hoplites from the Etennes, who inhabit the highlands of\r\nPisidia above Side, and half that number from Aspendus. The people of\r\nSide itself, partly from a wish to curry favour with Antiochus, but\r\nchiefly from hatred to the Aspendians, refused to take part in the\r\nrelief of Pednelissus. With these reinforcements, as well as his own\r\narmy, Garsyeris advanced towards Pednelissus, feeling certain that he\r\nwould be able to raise the siege at the first attack: but when the\r\nSelgians showed no sign of alarm, he entrenched himself at a moderate\r\ndistance from them. The Pednelissians were now becoming hard pressed\r\nfrom want of provisions; and Garsyeris, being anxious to do all he\r\ncould, got ready two thousand men, giving each a medimnus of wheat,\r\nand despatched them under cover of night into Pednelissus. But the\r\nSelgians getting intelligence of what was going on, and, coming out\r\nto intercept them, most of those who were carrying in the corn were\r\nkilled, and the Selgians got possession of the wheat. Elated with\r\nthis success, they now essayed to storm the camp of Garsyeris as well\r\nas the city. An adventurous daring in the presence of the enemy is\r\nindeed characteristic of the Selgians: and on this occasion they left\r\na barely sufficient number to guard their camp; and, surrounding the\r\nenemy’s entrenchment with the rest, assaulted it at several points at\r\nonce. Finding himself unexpectedly attacked on every side, and portions\r\nof his palisade being already torn down, Garsyeris, appreciating the\r\ngravity of the danger, and feeling that there was but little chance\r\nof averting total destruction, sent out some cavalry at a point which\r\nthe enemy had left unguarded. These the Selgians imagined to be flying\r\nin a panic and for fear of what was coming: and therefore, instead of\r\nattending to them, they treated them with utter contempt. When these\r\nhorsemen, however, had ridden round, so as to get on the rear of the\r\nenemy, they charged and fought with great fierceness. This raised the\r\nspirits of Garsyeris’s infantry, though they had already given way:\r\nand they therefore faced round, and once more offered resistance to\r\nthe troops that were storming their camp. The Selgians, accordingly,\r\nbeing now attacked on front and rear at once, broke and fled. At the\r\nsame time the Pednelissians sallied out and attacked the troops left in\r\ncharge of the Selgian camp, and drove them out. The pursuit lasted to\r\nso great a distance that no less than ten thousand of the Selgian army\r\nfell: of the survivors all who were allies fled to their own cities;\r\nwhile the Selgians themselves escaped over the highlands into their\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Panic at Selge.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Logbasis turns traitor.]\r\n\r\n+74.+ Garsyeris immediately started in pursuit of the fugitives, being\r\nin haste to get over the narrow pass, and approach Selge, before they\r\ncould make a stand, and form any plan for meeting his approach. Thus he\r\ncame to Selge with his army. But the inhabitants, having no longer any\r\nhopes in their allies, after the disaster which had affected them all\r\nalike, and themselves dispirited at the misfortune which had befallen\r\nthem, became exceedingly anxious for the safety of themselves and their\r\ncountry. They accordingly determined in public assembly to send one\r\nof their citizens on an embassy to Gassyeris, and selected for the\r\npurpose Logbasis, who had been for a long time on terms of intimacy\r\nand friendship with the Antiochus that lost his life in Thrace.[271]\r\nLaodice,[272] also, who became afterwards the wife of Achaeus, having\r\nbeen committed to his care, he had brought this young lady up as his\r\ndaughter, and had treated her with conspicuous kindness. The Selgians\r\ntherefore thought that his character made him eminently fitted for\r\nan ambassador in the circumstances, and accordingly sent him on the\r\nmission. He, however, obtained a private interview with Garsyeris,\r\nand was so far from carrying out the purpose for which he came, by\r\nproperly supporting the interests of his country, that on the contrary\r\nhe strongly urged Garsyeris to send with all speed for Achaeus, and\r\nundertook to put the city into their hands. Garsyeris, of course,\r\ngrasped eagerly at the chance offered to him and sent messengers to\r\ninduce Achaeus to come, and to inform him of the position of affairs.\r\nMeanwhile he concluded an armistice with the Selgians, and protracted\r\nthe negotiations for a treaty by continually bringing forward\r\nobjections and scruples on points of detail, in order to give time for\r\nthe arrival of Achaeus, and for Logbasis to conduct his negotiations\r\nand mature his plot.\r\n\r\n+75.+ While this was going on frequent meetings for discussion took\r\nplace between the camp and the town, and it became quite an ordinary\r\nthing for the soldiers to go into the town to purchase corn. This is\r\na state of things which has on many occasions proved fatal. And it\r\nappears to me that of all animals the most easily deceived is man,\r\nthough he has the credit of being the most cunning. For consider how\r\nmany entrenched camps and fortresses, how many and what great cities\r\nhave been betrayed by this kind of trick! And yet in spite of such\r\nfrequent and conspicuous examples of the many people to whom it has\r\nhappened, somehow or another we are always new to such deceit, and\r\nfall into the trap with the inexperience of youth. The reason is that\r\nwe do not keep ready for reference in our minds the disasters of those\r\nwho have made mistakes before us in this or that particular. But while\r\npreparing with great labour and cost stores of corn and money, and a\r\nprovision of walls and weapons to meet unforeseen eventualities, that\r\nwhich is the easiest of all and the most serviceable in the hour of\r\ndanger—that we all neglect; although we might obtain this experience\r\nfrom history and research, which in themselves add a dignity to leisure\r\nand a charm to existence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Failure of the treason of Logbasis.]\r\n\r\nAchaeus then duly arrived at the time expected: and after conference\r\nwith him, the Selgians had great hopes of experiencing some signal\r\nkindness at his hands. But in the interval Logbasis had little by\r\nlittle collected in his house some of the soldiers who came into the\r\ntown from the camp; and now advised the citizens not to let slip\r\nthe opportunity, but to act with the display of Achaeus’s kindly\r\ndisposition towards them before their eyes; and to put the finishing\r\nstroke to the treaty, after holding a general assembly of the whole\r\ncommunity to discuss the situation. An assembly was at once convened,\r\nto which even those on guard were all summoned to assist in bringing\r\nthe treaty to completion; and the citizens began deliberating on the\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n+76.+ Meanwhile Logbasis, who had agreed with the enemy to take that\r\nopportunity, began getting ready those who had congregated at his\r\nhouse, and prepared and armed himself and his sons also for the fight.\r\nAnd now Achaeus with half the hostile force was advancing towards the\r\ncity itself; while Garsyeris with the remainder was marching towards\r\nthe Cesbedium as it is called, or temple of Zeus, which stands in a\r\nposition commanding the city and presenting very much the appearance of\r\na citadel. But a goatherd, having by chance observed what was going on,\r\nbrought the news to the assembly; thereupon some of the citizens made a\r\nhurried rush to the Cesbedium, others to their posts on the wall, and\r\nthe majority in great anger to the house of Logbasis. His treasonable\r\npractice being thus detected, some of them climbed upon the roof,\r\nothers forced their way in by the front door, and murdered Logbasis\r\nand his sons and all the other men which they found there at the same\r\ntime. Then they caused a proclamation to be made promising freedom to\r\nall slaves who would join them: and dividing themselves into three\r\ncompanies, they hastened to defend all the points of vantage. When he\r\nsaw that the Cesbedium was already occupied, Garsyeris abandoned his\r\nenterprise; but Achaeus held on his way until he came right up to the\r\ngates: whereupon the Selgians sallied out, killed seven hundred, and\r\nforced the rest to give up the attempt. Upon this conclusion of their\r\nenterprise, Achaeus and Garsyeris retired to the camp. But the Selgians\r\nfearing treason among themselves, and alarmed at the presence of a\r\nhostile camp, sent out some of their elders in the guise of suppliants,\r\nand concluded a peace, on condition of paying four hundred talents on\r\nthe spot and restoring the Pednelissians whom they had taken prisoners,\r\nand paying a further sum of three hundred talents at a fixed date. Thus\r\ndid the Selgians by their own valour save their country, which they had\r\nbeen in danger of losing through the infamous treason of Logbasis; and\r\nthus neither disgraced their freedom, nor their relationship to the\r\nLacedaemonians.[273]\r\n\r\n+77.+ But after reducing Milyas, and the greater part of Pamphylia,\r\nAchaeus took his departure, and arriving at Sardis kept up a continuous\r\nwarfare with Attalus, and began threatening Prusias, and making himself\r\nan object of terror and alarm to all the inhabitants on this side\r\nTaurus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The expedition of Attalus to recover cities which had joined\r\nAchaeus.]\r\n\r\nBut while Achaeus was engaged on his expedition against Selge, Attalus\r\nwith the Aegosagae from Gaul was going through all the cities in\r\nAeolis, and the neighbourhood, which had before this been terrified\r\ninto joining Achaeus; but most of which now voluntarily and even\r\ngratefully gave in their adherence to him, though there were some few\r\nwhich waited to be forced. Now the cities which transferred their\r\nallegiance to him in the first instance were Cyme, Smyrna, and Phocaea;\r\nafter them Aegae and Temnus submitted, in terror at his approach; and\r\nthereupon he was waited upon by ambassadors from Teos and Colophon with\r\noffers to surrender themselves and their cities. He received them also\r\nupon the same terms as they had enjoyed before, taking hostages; but\r\nhe treated the ambassadors from Smyrna with special kindness, because\r\nthey had been the most constant in their loyalty of all. Continuing his\r\nmarch without interruption, he crossed the Lycus and arrived at the\r\nhamlets of Mysia, and thence came to Carseae. Overawing the inhabitants\r\nof this town, as well as the garrison of the Two Walls, he got them\r\nsurrendered to him by Themistocles, who had been, as it happened, left\r\nby Achaeus in command of this district. Starting thence, and wasting\r\nthe plain of Apia, he crossed Mount Pelecas and encamped near the river\r\nMegistus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mutiny of the Gauls.]\r\n\r\n+78.+ While he was here an eclipse of the moon occurred: and the\r\nGauls who had all along been much discontented at the hardships of\r\nthe march,—which was rendered the more painful for them by the fact\r\nof their being accompanied by their wives and children, who followed\r\nthe host in waggons,—now regarded the eclipse as an evil augury, and\r\nrefused to go on. But King Attalus, who got no effective service out\r\nof them, and saw that they straggled during the march and encamped\r\nby themselves, and wholly declined to obey orders and despised all\r\nauthority, was in great doubt as to what to do. He was anxious less\r\nthey should desert to Achaeus, and join in an attack upon himself:\r\nand was at the same time uneasy at the scandal to which he would give\r\nrise, if he caused his soldiers to surround and kill all these men, who\r\nwere believed to have crossed into Asia in reliance on his honour. He\r\ntherefore seized the occasion of their refusal to proceed, to promise\r\nthem that he would see that they were taken back to the place where\r\nthey had crossed into Asia; would assign them suitable lands for a\r\nsettlement; and would afterwards do them any service they asked for, if\r\nit was within his power and consistent with justice.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Attalus led the Aegosagae back to the Hellespont; and after\r\nnegotiations with the people of Lampsacus, Ilium, and Alexandria,\r\nconducted in a friendly spirit because they had preserved their loyalty\r\nto him, he returned with his army to Pergamum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy’s army: 70,000 infantry, 5000 cavalry, 73 elephants.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217. Antiochus and Ptolemy recommence hostilities in\r\nthe spring.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The army of Antiochus: 62,000 infantry, 6000 cavalry, 102\r\nelephants.]\r\n\r\n+79.+ At the beginning of the following spring, having all preparations\r\nfor war completed, Antiochus and Ptolemy determined to bring their\r\nclaims to Coele-Syria to the decision of a battle. Ptolemy accordingly\r\nset out from Alexandria with seventy thousand infantry, five thousand\r\ncavalry, and seventy three elephants. Being informed of his approach,\r\nAntiochus drew his forces together. These consisted of Daae, Carmani,\r\nand Cilicians, equipped as light armed troops to the number of about\r\nfive thousand, under the charge and command of Byttacus the Macedonian.\r\nUnder Theodotus, the Aetolian, who had deserted from Ptolemy, were ten\r\nthousand picked men from the whole kingdom, armed in the Macedonian\r\nfashion, most of whom had silver shields. The number of the phalanx\r\nwas twenty thousand, and they were led by Nicarchus and Theodotus\r\nHemiolius. In addition to these there were Agrianes and Persians, who\r\nwere either bowmen or slingers, to the number of two thousand. With\r\nthem were a thousand Thracians, under the command of Menedemus of\r\nAlabanda. There was also a mixed force of Medes, Cissians, Cadusians,\r\nand Carmanians, amounting to five thousand men, who were assigned to\r\nthe chief command of Aspasianus the Mede. Certain Arabians also and men\r\nof neighbouring tribes, to the number of ten thousand, were commanded\r\nby Zabdibelus. The mercenaries from Greece amounting to five thousand\r\nwere led by Hippolochus of Thessaly. Antiochus had also fifteen hundred\r\nCretans who came with Eurylochus, and a thousand Neo-Cretans commanded\r\nby Zelys of Gortyna; with whom were five hundred javelin men of Lydia,\r\nand a thousand Cardaces who came with Lysimachus the Gaul. The entire\r\nnumber of his horse was six thousand; four thousand were commanded by\r\nthe king’s nephew Antipater, the rest by Themison; so that the whole\r\nnumber of Antiochus’s force was sixty-two thousand infantry, six\r\nthousand cavalry, and one hundred and two elephants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy enters Palestine.]\r\n\r\n+80.+ Having marched to Pelusium Ptolemy made his first halt in that\r\ntown: and having been there joined by the stragglers, and having given\r\nout their rations of corn to his men, he got the army in motion, and\r\nled them by a line of march which goes through the waterless region\r\nskirting Mount Casius and the Marshes.[274] On the fifth day’s march\r\nhe reached his destination, and pitched his camp a distance of fifty\r\nstades from Rhaphia, which is the first city of Coele-Syria towards\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus goes to meet him.]\r\n\r\nWhile Ptolemy was effecting this movement Antiochus arrived with his\r\narmy at Gaza, where he was joined by some reinforcements, and once\r\nmore commenced his advance, proceeding at a leisurely pace. He passed\r\nRhaphia and encamped about ten stades from the enemy. For a while the\r\ntwo armies preserved this distance, and remained encamped opposite each\r\nother. But after some few days, wishing to remove to more advantageous\r\nground and to inspire confidence in his troops, Antiochus pushed\r\nforward his camp so much nearer Ptolemy, that the palisades of the two\r\ncamps were not more than five stades from each other; and while in this\r\nposition, there were frequent struggles at the watering-places and on\r\nforays, as well as infantry and cavalry skirmishes in the space between\r\nthe camps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Daring attempt of Theodotus to assassinate Ptolemy.]\r\n\r\n+81.+ In the course of these proceedings Theodotus conceived and put\r\ninto execution an enterprise, very characteristic of an Aetolian, but\r\nundoubtedly requiring great personal courage. Having formerly lived\r\nat Ptolemy’s court he knew the king’s tastes and habits. Accordingly,\r\naccompanied by two others, he entered the enemy’s camp just before\r\ndaybreak; where, owing to the dim light, he could not be recognised\r\nby his face, while his dress and other accoutrements did not render\r\nhim noticeable, owing to the variety of costume prevailing among\r\nthemselves. He had marked the position of the king’s tent during the\r\npreceding days, for the skirmishes took place quite close; and he\r\nnow walked boldly up to it, and passed through all the outer ring of\r\nattendants without being observed: but when he came to the tent in\r\nwhich the king was accustomed to transact business and dine, though he\r\nsearched it in every conceivable way, he failed to find the king; for\r\nPtolemy slept in another tent, separate from the public and official\r\ntent. He however wounded two men who were sleeping there, and killed\r\nAndreas, the king’s physician; and then returned safely to his own\r\ncamp, without meeting with any molestation, except just as he was\r\npassing over the vallum of the enemy’s camp. As far as daring went, he\r\nhad fulfilled his purpose: but he had failed in prudence by not taking\r\nthe precaution to ascertain where Ptolemy was accustomed to sleep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disposition of the two armies for the battle of Rhaphia.]\r\n\r\n+82.+ After being encamped opposite each other for five days, the two\r\nkings resolved to bring matters to the decision of battle. And upon\r\nPtolemy beginning to move his army outside its camp, Antiochus hastened\r\nto do the same. Both formed their front of their phalanx and men armed\r\nin the Macedonian manner. But Ptolemy’s two wings were formed as\r\nfollows:—Polycrates, with the cavalry under his command, occupied the\r\nleft, and between him and the phalanx were Cretans standing close by\r\nthe horsemen; next them came the royal guard;[275] then the peltasts\r\nunder Socrates, adjoining the Libyans armed in Macedonian fashion.\r\nOn the right wing was Echecrates of Thessaly, with his division of\r\ncavalry; on his left were stationed Gauls and Thracians; next them\r\nPhoxidas and the Greek mercenaries, extending to the Egyptian phalanx.\r\nOf the elephants forty were on the left wing, where Ptolemy was to be\r\nin person during the battle; the other thirty-three had been stationed\r\nin front of the right wing opposite the mercenary cavalry.\r\n\r\nAntiochus also placed sixty of his elephants commanded by his\r\nfoster-brother Philip in front of his right wing, on which he was to\r\nbe present personally, to fight opposite Ptolemy. Behind these he\r\nstationed the two thousand cavalry commanded by Antipater, and two\r\nthousand more at right angles to them.\r\n\r\nIn line with the cavalry he placed the Cretans, and next them the Greek\r\nmercenaries; with the latter he mixed two thousand of these armed in\r\nthe Macedonian fashion under the command of the Macedonian Byttacus.\r\nAt the extreme point of the left wing he placed two thousand cavalry\r\nunder the command of Themison; by their side Cardacian and Lydian\r\njavelin-men; next them the light-armed division of three thousand,\r\ncommanded by Menedemus; then the Cissians, Medes, and Carmanians; and\r\nby their side the Arabians and neighbouring peoples who continued the\r\nline up to the phalanx. The remainder of the elephants he placed in\r\nfront of his left wing under the command of Myiscus, one of the boys\r\nabout the court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Addresses to the two armies before the battle of Rhaphia.]\r\n\r\n+83.+ The two armies having been drawn up in the order I have\r\ndescribed; the kings went along their respective lines, and addressed\r\nwords of encouragement and exhortation to their officers and friends.\r\nBut as they both rested their strongest hopes on their phalanx, they\r\nshowed their greatest earnestness and addressed their strongest\r\nexhortations to them; which were re-echoed in Ptolemy’s case by\r\nAndromachus and Sosibius and the king’s sister Arsinoe; in the case\r\nof Antiochus by Theodotus and Nicarchus: these officers being the\r\ncommanders of the phalanx in the two armies respectively. The substance\r\nof what was said on both sides was the same: for neither monarch had\r\nany glorious or famous achievement of his own to quote to those whom he\r\nwas addressing, seeing that they had but recently succeeded to their\r\ncrowns; but they endeavoured to inspire the men of the phalanx with\r\nspirit and boldness, by reminding them of the glory of their ancestors,\r\nand the great deeds performed by them. But they chiefly dwelt upon the\r\nhopes of advancement which the men might expect at their hands in the\r\nfuture; and they called upon and exhorted the leaders and the whole\r\nbody of men, who were about to be engaged, to maintain the fight with a\r\nmanly and courageous spirit. So with these or similar words, delivered\r\nby their own lips or by interpreters, they rode along their lines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle of Rhaphia.]\r\n\r\n+84.+ Ptolemy, accompanied by his sister, having arrived at the left\r\nwing of his army, and Antiochus with the royal guard at the right: they\r\ngave the signal for the battle, and opened the fight by a charge of\r\nelephants. Only some few of Ptolemy’s elephants came to close quarters\r\nwith the foe: seated on these the soldiers in the howdahs maintained\r\na brilliant fight, lunging at and striking each other with crossed\r\npikes.[276] But the elephants themselves fought still more brilliantly,\r\nusing all their strength in the encounter, and pushing against each\r\nother, forehead to forehead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fighting elephants.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antiochus’s right wing successful.]\r\n\r\nThe way in which elephants fight is this: they get their tusks\r\nentangled and jammed, and then push against one another with all their\r\nmight, trying to make each other yield ground until one of them proving\r\nsuperior in strength has pushed aside the other’s trunk; and when once\r\nhe can get a side blow at his enemy, he pierces him with his tusks as\r\na bull would with his horns. Now, most of Ptolemy’s animals, as is the\r\nway with Libyan elephants, were afraid to face the fight: for they\r\ncannot stand the smell or the trumpeting of the Indian elephants, but\r\nare frightened at their size and strength, I suppose, and run away from\r\nthem at once without waiting to come near them. This is exactly what\r\nhappened on this occasion: and upon their being thrown into confusion\r\nand being driven back upon their own lines, Ptolemy’s guard gave way\r\nbefore the rush of the animals; while Antiochus, wheeling his men\r\nso as to avoid the elephants, charged the division of cavalry under\r\nPolycrates. At the same time the Greek mercenaries stationed near the\r\nphalanx, and behind the elephants, charged Ptolemy’s peltasts and made\r\nthem give ground, the elephants having already thrown their ranks also\r\ninto confusion. Thus Ptolemy’s whole left wing began to give way before\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ptolemy’s right wing also successful.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The centre coming into action. Ptolemy is victorious.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Final retreat of Antiochus.]\r\n\r\n+85.+ Echecrates the commander of the right wing waited at first\r\nto see the result of the struggle between the other wings of the\r\ntwo armies: but when he saw the dust coming his way, and that the\r\nelephants opposite his division were afraid even to approach the\r\nhostile elephants at all, he ordered Phoxidas to charge the part of the\r\nenemy opposite him with his Greek mercenaries; while he made a flank\r\nmovement with the cavalry and the division behind the elephants; and\r\nso getting out of the line of the hostile elephants’ attack, charged\r\nthe enemy’s cavalry on the rear or the flank and quickly drove them\r\nfrom their ground. Phoxidas and his men were similarly successful: for\r\nthey charged the Arabians and Medes and forced them into precipitate\r\nflight. Thus Antiochus’s right wing gained a victory, while his left\r\nwas defeated. The phalanxes, left without the support of either wing,\r\nremained intact in the centre of the plain, in a state of alternate\r\nhope and fear for the result. Meanwhile Antiochus was assisting in\r\ngaining the victory on his right wing; while Ptolemy, who had retired\r\nbehind his phalanx, now came forward in the centre, and showing\r\nhimself in the view of both armies struck terror in the hearts of the\r\nenemy, but inspired great spirit and enthusiasm in his own men; and\r\nAndromachus and Sosibius at once ordered them to lower their sarissae\r\nand charge. The picked Syrian troops stood their ground only for a\r\nshort time, and the division of Nicarchus quickly broke and fled.\r\nAntiochus presuming, in his youthful inexperience, from the success of\r\nhis own division, that he would be equally victorious all along the\r\nline, was pressing on the pursuit; but upon one of the older officers\r\nat length giving him warning, and pointing out that the cloud of dust\r\nraised by the phalanx was moving towards their own camp, he understood\r\ntoo late what was happening; and endeavoured to gallop back with the\r\nsquadron of royal cavalry on to the field. But finding his whole line\r\nin full retreat he was forced to retire to Rhaphia: comforting himself\r\nwith the belief that, as far as he was personally concerned, he had won\r\na victory, but had been defeated in the whole battle by the want of\r\nspirit and courage shown by the rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The losses on either side.]\r\n\r\n+86.+ Having secured the final victory by his phalanx, and killed\r\nlarge numbers of the enemy in the pursuit by means of his cavalry and\r\nmercenaries on his right wing, Ptolemy retired to his own camp and\r\nthere spent the night. But next day, after picking up and burying his\r\nown dead, and stripping the bodies of the enemy, he advanced towards\r\nRhaphia. Antiochus had wished, immediately after the retreat of his\r\narmy, to make a camp outside the city; and there rally such of his men\r\nas had fled in compact bodies: but finding that the greater number had\r\nretreated into the town, he was compelled to enter it himself also.\r\nNext morning, however, before daybreak, he led out the relics of his\r\narmy and made the best of his way to Gaza. There he pitched a camp: and\r\nhaving sent an embassy to obtain leave to pick up his dead, he obtained\r\na truce for performing their obsequies. His loss amounted to nearly ten\r\nthousand infantry and three hundred cavalry killed, and four thousand\r\ntaken prisoners. Three elephants were killed on the field, and two died\r\nafterwards of their wounds. On Ptolemy’s side the losses were fifteen\r\nhundred infantry killed and seven hundred cavalry: sixteen of his\r\nelephants were killed, and most of the others captured.\r\n\r\nSuch was the result of the battle of Rhaphia between kings Ptolemy and\r\nAntiochus for the possession of Coele-Syria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The effect of the battle of Rhaphia.]\r\n\r\nAfter picking up his dead Antiochus retired with his army to his own\r\ncountry: while Ptolemy took over Rhaphia and the other towns without\r\ndifficulty, all the states vying with each other as to which should\r\nbe first to renew their allegiance and come over to him. And perhaps\r\nit is the way of the world everywhere to accommodate one’s self to\r\ncircumstances at such times; but it is eminently true of the race\r\ninhabiting that country, that they have a natural turn and inclination\r\nto worship success. Moreover it was all the more natural in this\r\ncase, owing to the existing disposition of the people in favour of\r\nthe Alexandrian kings; for the inhabitants of Coele-Syria are somehow\r\nalways more loyally disposed to this family than to any other.\r\nAccordingly they now stopped short of no extravagance of adulation,\r\nhonouring Ptolemy with crowns, sacrifices, and every possible\r\ncompliment of the kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace between Ptolemy and Antiochus for a year, B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+87.+ Meanwhile Antiochus, on arriving at the city which bears his\r\nown name, immediately despatched an embassy to Ptolemy, consisting of\r\nAntipater, his nephew, and Theodotus Hemiolius, to treat of a peace, in\r\ngreat alarm lest the enemy should advance upon him. For his defeat had\r\ninspired him with distrust of his own forces, and he was afraid that\r\nAchaeus would seize the opportunity to attack him. It did not occur\r\nto Ptolemy to take any of these circumstances into account: but being\r\nthoroughly satisfied with his unexpected success, and generally at his\r\nunlooked for acquisition of Coele-Syria, he was by no means indisposed\r\nto peace; but even more inclined to it than he ought to have been:\r\ninfluenced in that direction by the habitual effeminacy and corruption\r\nof his manner of life. Accordingly, when Antipater and his colleague\r\narrived, after some little bluster and vituperation of Antiochus for\r\nwhat had taken place, he agreed to a truce for a year. He sent Sosibius\r\nback with the ambassadors to ratify the treaty: while he himself, after\r\nremaining three months in Syria and Phoenicia, and settling the towns,\r\nleft Andromachus of Aspendus as governor of this district, and started\r\nwith his sister and friends for Alexandria: having brought the war to a\r\nconclusion in a way that surprised his subjects, when they contrasted\r\nit with the principles on which he spent the rest of his life.\r\nAntiochus after exchanging ratifications of the treaty with Sosibius,\r\nemployed himself in making preparations for attacking Achaeus, as he\r\nhad originally begun doing. Such was the political situation in Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Earthquake at Rhodes. Royal liberality, B.C. 224.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hiero and Gelo.]\r\n\r\n+88.+ About the same period the earthquake occurred at Rhodes, which\r\noverthrew the great Colossus and the larger part of the walls and\r\ndockyards. But the adroit policy of the Rhodians converted this\r\nmisfortune into an opportunity; and under their skilful management,\r\ninstead of adding to their embarrassments, it became the means of\r\nrestoring their prosperity. So decisive in human affairs, public or\r\nprivate, is the difference between incapacity and good sense, between\r\nidle indifference and a close attention to business. Good fortune\r\nonly damages the one, while disaster is but a means of recovery to\r\nthe other. This was illustrated by the manner in which the Rhodians\r\nturned the misfortune that befel them to account. They enhanced its\r\nmagnitude and importance by the prominence which they gave it, and the\r\nserious tone in which they spoke of it, as well by the mouth of their\r\nambassadors as in the intercourse of private life; and they created\r\nthus such an effect upon other states, and especially upon the feelings\r\nof the kings, that they were not only overwhelmed with presents, but\r\nmade the donors feel actually obliged for their acceptance of them.\r\nHiero and Gelo, for instance, presented them with seventy-five talents\r\nof silver, part at once, and the rest at a very short interval, as\r\na contribution towards the expenses of the gymnasium; gave them\r\nfor religious purposes some silver cauldrons and their stands, and\r\nsome water vessels; and in addition to this ten talents for their\r\nsacrifices, and ten more to attract new citizens: their intention\r\nbeing that the whole present should amount to a hundred talents.[277]\r\nNot only so, but they gave immunity from customs to Rhodian merchants\r\ncoming to their ports; and presented them besides with fifty\r\ncatapults of three cubits length. In spite too of these large gifts,\r\nthey regarded themselves as under an obligation to the Rhodians;\r\nand accordingly erected statues in the _Deigma_ or Mart of Rhodes,\r\nrepresenting the community of Rhodes crowned by that of Syracuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Antigonus.]\r\n\r\n+89.+ Then too Ptolemy offered them three hundred talents of silver;\r\na million medimni[278] of corn; [Sidenote: Ptolemy.] ship timber for\r\nten quinqueremes and ten triremes, consisting of forty thousand cubits\r\nof squared pine planking; a thousand talents of bronze coinage; three\r\nthousand talents[279] of tow; three thousand pieces of sail cloth;\r\nthree thousand talents for the repair of the Colossus; a hundred master\r\nbuilders with three hundred and fifty workmen, and fourteen talents\r\nyearly to pay their wages. Besides this he gave twelve thousand medimni\r\nof corn for their public games and sacrifices, and twenty thousand\r\nmedimni for victualling ten triremes. The greater part of these goods\r\nwas delivered at once, as well as a third of the whole of the money\r\nnamed. In a similar spirit Antigonus offered ten thousand timbers,\r\nvarying from sixteen to eight cubits in length, to be used as purlins;\r\nfive thousand rafters seven cubits long; three thousand talents of\r\niron; a thousand talents of pitch; a thousand amphorae of the same\r\nunboiled; and a hundred talents of silver besides. His queen, Chryseis,\r\nalso gave a hundred thousand medimni of corn, and three thousand\r\ntalents of lead. Again Seleucus,[280] father of Antiochus, besides\r\ngranting freedom from imports to Rhodians sailing to his dominions,\r\nand besides giving ten quinqueremes fully equipped, and two hundred\r\nthousand medimni of corn; gave also ten thousand cubits of timber, and\r\na thousand talents of resin and hair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other princes.]\r\n\r\n+90.+ Nor were Prusias and Mithridates far behind these in liberality;\r\nnor the princes Lysanias, Olympichus, and Lymnaeas, who were at that\r\ntime in power in different parts of Asia; and as for states that,\r\naccording to their several abilities contributed to their assistance,\r\nit would be difficult to reckon their number. In fact, though when we\r\nregard the time which it took the city to recover its populousness,\r\nand the state of desolation from which it started, we cannot fail to\r\nbe struck at the rapidity and the extent of its improvement in regard\r\nboth to private and public wealth; yet when we contemplate the natural\r\nadvantages of its site, and the contributions from outside which served\r\nto raise its fortunes to their original height, this feeling must give\r\nway to a conviction that the advance was somewhat less than might have\r\nbeen expected.\r\n\r\nMy object in giving these details is twofold. I wished to exhibit the\r\nbrilliant conduct of their public affairs by the Rhodians, for indeed\r\nthey deserve both to be commended and imitated: and I wished also to\r\npoint out the insignificance of the gifts bestowed by the kings of our\r\nown day, and received by nations and states; that these monarchs may\r\nnot imagine that by the expenditure of four or five talents they are\r\ndoing anything so very great, or expect to receive at the hands of the\r\nGreeks the honour enjoyed by former kings; and that states when they\r\nsee before their eyes the magnitude of the presents formerly bestowed,\r\nmay not, nowadays, in return for insignificant and paltry benefactions,\r\nblindly bestow their most ample and splendid honours; but may use that\r\ndiscrimination in apportioning their favours to desert, in which Greeks\r\nexcel the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217. Greece. Return of Lycurgus to Sparta. He projects\r\nan invasion of Messenia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The preparations of Aratus.]\r\n\r\n+91.+ Just at the beginning of this summer, while Agetas was Strategus\r\nof the Aetolians, and when Aratus had just become Strategus of the\r\nAchaean league,—at which point we broke off in our history of the\r\nSocial war,[281]—Lycurgus of Sparta returned home from Aetolia. The\r\nEphors had discovered that the charge on which he had been banished\r\nwas false; and had accordingly sent for him back, and recalled him\r\nfrom exile. He at once began making an arrangement with Pyrrhias the\r\nAetolian, who happened at the time to be commander in Elis, for an\r\ninvasion of Messenia. Now, when Aratus came into office, he found the\r\nmercenary army of the league in a state of complete demoralisation, and\r\nthe cities very slack to pay the tax for their support, owing to the\r\nbad and spiritless manner in which his predecessor Eperatus had managed\r\nthe affairs of the league. He, however, exhorted the members of the\r\nleague to reform, and obtained a decree dealing with this matter; and\r\nthen threw himself with energy into the preparations for the war. The\r\ndecree passed by the Achaeans ordered the maintenance of eight thousand\r\nmercenary infantry and five hundred horse, together with three thousand\r\nAchaean infantry and three hundred horse, enrolled in the usual way;\r\nand that of these latter five hundred foot and fifty horse were to be\r\nbrazen-shield men from Megalopolis, and the same number of Argives.\r\nIt ordered also that three ships should be manned to cruise off Acte\r\nand in the Argolic gulf, and three off Patrae and Dyme, and in the sea\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ill-success of Lycurgus.]\r\n\r\n+92.+ While Aratus was engaged in these transactions, and in completing\r\nthese preparations, Lycurgus and Pyrrhias, after an interchange\r\nof messages to secure their making their expedition at the same\r\ntime, marched into Messenia. The Achaean Strategus, aware of their\r\ndesign, came with the mercenaries and some of the picked Achaeans to\r\nMegalopolis, with the view of supporting the Messenians. After setting\r\nout, Lycurgus got possession of Calamae, a stronghold in Messenia, by\r\ntreachery; and pressed hurriedly forward to effect a junction with the\r\nAetolians. But Pyrrhias had started from Elis with a wholly inadequate\r\nforce, and, having been easily stopped at the pass into Messenia by\r\nthe Cyparissians, had turned back. Lycurgus therefore being unable\r\nto effect his junction with Pyrrhias, and not being strong enough by\r\nhimself, after assaulting Andania for a short time, returned back to\r\nSparta without having effected anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the plot of the enemy had thus gone to pieces; Aratus, with a\r\nprovident regard for the future, arranged with Taurion to provide fifty\r\nhorse and five hundred foot, and with the Messenians to send an equal\r\nnumber; with the view of using these men to protect the territories of\r\nMessenia, Megalopolis, Tegea, and Argos,—for these districts, being\r\non the frontier of Laconia, have to bear the brunt of Lacedaemonian\r\ninvasion for the rest of the Peloponnese; while with the Achaean levies\r\nand mercenaries he planned to guard the parts of Achaia which lay\r\ntowards Elis and Aetolia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Condition of Megalopolis.]\r\n\r\n+93.+ After adjusting these matters, he settled in accordance with the\r\ndecree of the league the intestine disputes at Megalopolis. For it\r\nhappened that the people of this town having been recently deprived\r\nof their country by Cleomenes,[282] and, to use a common expression,\r\nshaken to their foundations, were in absolute want of many things,\r\nand ill-provided with all: for they persisted in maintaining their\r\nusual scale of living, while their means both public and private were\r\nentirely crippled. The consequence was that the town was filled with\r\ndisputes, jealousies, and mutual hatred; which is ever the case,\r\nboth with states and individuals, when means fall short of desires.\r\nThe first controversy was about the walling of the town,—one party\r\nmaintaining that the limits of the city should be contracted to a size\r\nadmitting of being completely walled and guarded at a time of danger;\r\nfor that in the late occasion it was its size and unguarded state which\r\nhad caused their disaster. In addition to this it was maintained by\r\nthis party that the landowners should contribute the third part of\r\ntheir land to provide for the enrolment of new citizens. The other\r\nparty rejected the notion of contracting the limits of the city and\r\nwould not consent to contribute a third part of their lands. But the\r\nmost serious controversy of all was in regard to the laws draughted for\r\nthem by Prytanis, an eminent Peripatetic philosopher, whom Antigonus\r\nDoson appointed to draw them up a constitution. In this distracted\r\nstate of politics, Aratus intervened with all the earnestness he\r\ncould command, and succeeded in pacifying the heated feelings of the\r\ncitizens. The terms on which the controversies were settled were\r\nengraved on a column, and set up near the altar of Vesta in the\r\nHomarium.[283]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another raid of Aetolians from Elis.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Achaean fleet retaliates on Aetolia.]\r\n\r\n+94.+ After arranging this settlement, Aratus broke up his camp; and\r\ngoing on himself to the congress from of the Achaeans, handed over the\r\nmercenaries to Lycus of Pharae, as the Sub-Strategus of the league. But\r\nthe Eleans, being dissatisfied with Pyrrhias, once more induced the\r\nAetolians to send them Euripidas; who, waiting until the Achaeans were\r\nengaged in their congress, took sixty horse and two thousand foot, and\r\nstarted on a raid. Having passed through the territory of Pharae, he\r\noverran the country up to the territory of Aegium; and after securing\r\nand driving off a considerable booty, he began a retreat towards\r\nLeontium. But Lycus, learning what had happened, went in all haste to\r\nprotect the country; and falling in with the enemy, he attacked them\r\nat once and killed four hundred and took two hundred prisoners, among\r\nwhom were the following men of rank: Physsias, Antanor, Clearchus,\r\nAndrolochus, Euanoridas, Aristogeiton, Nicasippus, and Aspasius. The\r\narms and baggage fell entirely into his hands. About the same time\r\nthe Navarch of the league having gone on an expedition to Molycria,\r\nreturned with nearly a hundred captives. Returning once more to Aetolia\r\nhe sailed to Chalceia and captured two war ships, with their crews,\r\nwhich put out to resist him; and took also a long boat with its men on\r\nthe Aetolian Rhium. There being thus an influx of booty both by sea\r\nand land at the same period, and a considerable amount of money and\r\nprovisions being obtained from this, the soldiers felt confident of\r\ngetting their pay, and the cities of the league were sanguine of not\r\nbeing likely to be hard pressed by their contributions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scerdilaidas the Illyrian plunders the coast.]\r\n\r\n+95.+ While these events were taking place Scerdilaidas, thinking\r\nthat he was not being treated fairly, because some of the payments\r\nagreed upon in his treaty with Philip were in arrear, sent out fifteen\r\ngalleys, treacherously pretending that their object was to receive\r\nand convoy the money. These galleys sailed to Leucas, where they were\r\nreceived by all as friendly, owing to their former alliance: but the\r\nonly mischief they had time to do was to make a treacherous attack\r\non the Corinthian Agathinus and Cassander, who had come there on\r\nboard Taurion’s ships, and were lying at anchor close to them with\r\nfour vessels. These they captured with their vessels and sent to\r\nScerdilaidas; and then putting out to sea from Leucas, and sailing\r\ntowards Malea, they plundered and captured the merchants whom they met.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More raids.]\r\n\r\nHarvest time was now approaching: and as Taurion paid little attention\r\nto the protection of the cities I mentioned above; Aratus in person,\r\nat the head of some picked Achaean troops, protected the getting in\r\nof the harvest round Argos: while Euripidas at the head of a force of\r\nAetolians set out on a raid, with the object of ravaging the territory\r\nof Tritaea. But when Lycus and Demodocus, the Hipparch of the league,\r\nheard of the expedition of the Aetolians from Elis, they collected\r\nthe people of Dymae, Patrae and Pharae, and joining the mercenaries\r\nto these forces made an incursion upon Elis. Arrived at a place\r\ncalled Phyxium, they allowed their light-armed troops and their horse\r\nto plunder the country, but kept their hoplites concealed near this\r\nplace: and when the Eleans had sallied out in full force to attack\r\nthe foraging parties, and were pursuing them as they retreated, the\r\nhoplites with Lycus rose from their hiding-place and charged them\r\nas they rushed heedlessly on. The Eleans did not stand against the\r\nattack, but fled at the mere appearance of the hoplites: who killed two\r\nhundred of them and took eighty prisoners, and carried off with them\r\nin safety all the booty that had been driven in from the country. At\r\nthe same time the Navarch of the league made numerous descents upon\r\nCalydonia and the territory of Naupactus; and not only overran the\r\ncountry, but twice annihilated the force sent out to resist him. Among\r\nothers he took Cleonicus of Naupactus prisoner: who owing to this being\r\na proxenus of the Achaeans was not sold on the spot, and after some\r\nlittle time was set free without ransom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Acarnania.]\r\n\r\n+96.+ About the same time Agetas, the Strategus of the Aetolian\r\nleague, proclaimed a general levy of Aetolians, and went on a foraging\r\nexpedition into the territory of the Acarnanians. He marched through\r\nall Epirus, plundering as he went without let or hindrance; after doing\r\nwhich he returned home, and dismissed the Aetolian levy to their own\r\ncities. But the Acarnanians, upon making a retaliatory invasion of\r\nthe territory of Stratus, were seized with a panic: and returned with\r\ndisgrace, though without loss; because the people of Stratus did not\r\nventure to pursue them, believing that their retreat was a ruse to\r\ncover an ambuscade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phanoteus in Phocis. The biter bit.]\r\n\r\nAn instance of counter-treachery occurred also at Phanoteus. Alexander\r\nwho had been appointed governor of Phocis by Philip, entered into a\r\nplot against the Aetolians, through the agency of a certain Jason, who\r\nhad been appointed by himself to command the city of Phanoteus. This\r\nman sent a message to Agetas, the Strategus of the Aetolian league,\r\nagreeing to hand over to him the citadel of Phanoteus; and he confirmed\r\nhis offer by a regularly sworn treaty. On the appointed day Agetas\r\ncame with his Aetolian levy to Phanoteus under cover of night; and\r\nconcealing the rest at some little distance, he selected a hundred\r\nof the most active men and sent them towards the citadel. Jason had\r\nAlexander all ready with his soldiers, but duly received the Aetolians\r\nas he had sworn into the citadel. Immediately Alexander and his men\r\nthrew themselves into the citadel also: the Aetolian hundred picked\r\nsoldiers were made prisoners; and when daylight showed Agetas what had\r\ntaken place, he drew off his troops,—baffled by a ruse very like what\r\nhe had on many occasions practised himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s campaign in Upper Macedonia and Thessaly.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meliteia.]\r\n\r\n+97.+ About this same period King Philip captured Bylazora, the largest\r\ntown of Paeonia, and very favourably situated for commanding the pass\r\nfrom Dardania to Macedonia: so that by this achievement he was all\r\nbut entirely freed from any fear of the Dardani, it being no longer\r\neasy for them to invade Macedonia, as long as this city gave Philip\r\nthe command of the pass. Having secured this place, he despatched\r\nChrysogonus with all speed to summon the upper Macedonians to arms;\r\nwhile he himself, taking on the men of Bottia and Amphaxitis, arrived\r\nat Edessa. Waiting there until he was joined by the Macedonians under\r\nChrysogonus, he started with his whole army, and on the sixth day’s\r\nmarch arrived at Larisa; and thence by a rapid night march he came\r\nbefore daybreak to Meliteia, and placing scaling ladders against the\r\nwalls, attempted to take the town by escalade. The suddenness and\r\nunexpectedness of the attack so dismayed the people of Meliteia, that\r\nhe would easily have taken the town; but he was baffled by the fact of\r\nthe ladders proving to be far too short.\r\n\r\n+98.+ This is the kind of mistake which above all others reflects\r\ndiscredit on the commanders. For what can be more culpable than to\r\narrive at a town which they mean to carry, in an entirely unprovided\r\nstate, without having taken the precaution of measuring walls, cliffs,\r\nand the like, by which they intend to effect their entrance? Or again,\r\nwhile satisfying themselves as to these measurements, to entrust\r\nthe construction of ladders and all such machinery, which, though\r\ntaking little time to make, have to stand the test of a very critical\r\nservice, without consideration, and to incompetent persons,—is not\r\nthis deserving of censure? For in such actions it is not a question of\r\nsucceeding or failing without ill consequences; but failure is followed\r\nby positive damage in manifold respects: danger to the bravest of the\r\nmen at the actual time, and still greater danger during their retreat,\r\nwhen they have once incurred the contempt of the enemy. The examples\r\nof such disasters are numerous; for you will find that of those who\r\nhave failed in such attempts, many more have perished, or have been\r\nreduced to the last extremity of danger, than have come off scatheless.\r\nMoreover, no one can deny that they arouse distrust and hatred against\r\nthemselves for the future, and give all men warning to be on their\r\nguard. For it is not only the persons attacked, but all who know what\r\nhas happened, who are thereby bidden to look out for themselves and be\r\non the watch. Wherefore it is never right for men in places of trust\r\nto conduct such enterprises inconsiderately. The method also of taking\r\nsuch measurements, and constructing machines of this kind, is easy and\r\nliable to no mistakes, if they are taken in hand scientifically.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, I must resume the thread of my narrative,\r\nbut I shall take another fitting opportunity in the course of my work\r\nto speak of these matters, and will endeavour to show how mistakes may\r\nbest be avoided in such undertakings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thebae Phthiotides, B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+99.+ Thus baffled in his attempt upon Meliteia, Philip encamped upon\r\nthe bank of the Enipeus, and collected from Larisa and the other\r\ncities the siege train which he had caused to be constructed during\r\nthe winter. For the chief object of his campaign was the capture of\r\nthe city called Phthiotid Thebes. Now this city lies no long way from\r\nthe sea, about thirty stades from Larisa, and is conveniently situated\r\nin regard both to Magnesia and Thessaly; but especially as commanding\r\nthe district of Demetrias in Magnesia, and of Pharsalus and Pherae in\r\nThessaly. From it, at that very time, much damage was being inflicted\r\nupon the Demetrians, Pharsalians, and Larisaeans; as the Aetolians\r\nwere in occupation of it, and made continual predatory expeditions,\r\noften as far as to the plain of Amyrus. Philip did not regard the\r\nmatter as at all of small importance, but was exceedingly bent on\r\ntaking the town. Having therefore got together a hundred and fifty\r\ncatapults, and twenty-five stone-throwing ballistae, he sat down before\r\nThebes. He distributed his forces between three points in the vicinity\r\nof the city; one was encamped near Scopium; a second near a place\r\ncalled Heliotropium; and the third on the hill overhanging the town.\r\nThe spaces between these camps he fortified by a trench and double\r\npalisade, and further secured them by towers of wood, at intervals of a\r\nhundred feet, with an adequate guard. When these works were finished,\r\nhe collected all his siege train together and began to move his engines\r\ntowards the citadel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thebes is taken, its inhabitants enslaved, and its name\r\nchanged to Philippopolis.]\r\n\r\n+100.+ For the first three days the king was unable to make any\r\nprogress in bringing his machines against the town, owing to the\r\ngallant and even desperate defence which the garrison opposed to him.\r\nBut when the continual skirmishing, and the volleys of missiles, had\r\nbegan to tell upon the defenders, and some of them were killed and\r\nothers disabled by wounds; the defence becoming a little slacker, the\r\nMacedonians began sinking mines, and at last after nine days' work\r\nreached the walls. They then carried on the work by relays, so as never\r\nto leave it off day or night: and thus in three days had undermined\r\nand underpinned two hundred feet of the wall. The props, however,\r\nproved too weak to support the weight, and gave way; so that the wall\r\nfell without the Macedonians having the trouble of setting fire to\r\nthem. When they had worked energetically at clearing the debris, and\r\nhad made every preparation for entering by the breach, and were just\r\non the point of carrying it, the Thebans in a panic surrendered the\r\ntown. The security which this achievement of Philip’s gave to Magnesia\r\nand Thessaly deprived the Aetolians of a rich field for plunder; and\r\ndemonstrated to his army that he had been justified in putting Leontius\r\nto death, for his deliberate treachery in the previous siege of Palae.\r\nHaving thus become master of Thebes he sold its existing inhabitants\r\ninto slavery, and drafting in some Macedonian settlers changed its name\r\nto Philippopolis.\r\n\r\nJust as the king had finished the settlement of Thebes, ambassadors\r\nonce more came from Chios, Rhodes, Byzantium, and King Ptolemy to\r\nnegotiate terms of peace. He answered them in much the same terms as\r\nhe had the former,[284] that he was not averse to peace; and bade them\r\ngo and find out what the feelings of the Aetolians were. Meanwhile he\r\nhimself cared little about making peace, but continued steadily to\r\nprosecute his designs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip hears of the Battle of Thrasymene, 22d June.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nemean festival. Midsummer of B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\n+101.+ Accordingly, when he heard that the galleys of Scerdilaidas\r\nwere committing acts of piracy off Malea, and treating all merchants\r\nas open enemies, and had treacherously seized some of his own vessels\r\nwhich were at anchor at Leucas, he fitted out twelve decked ships,\r\neight open vessels, and thirty light craft called hemioliae,[285] and\r\nsailed through the Euripus in hot haste to come up with the Illyrians;\r\nexceedingly excited about his plans for carrying on the war against the\r\nAetolians, as he knew nothing as yet of what had happened in Italy.\r\nFor the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal in Etruria took place while\r\nPhilip was besieging Thebes, but the report of that occurrence had not\r\nyet reached Greece. Philip arrived too late to capture the galleys:\r\nand therefore, dropping anchor at Cenchreae, he sent away his decked\r\nships, with orders to sail round Malea in the direction of Aegium and\r\nPatrae; but having caused the rest of his vessels to be dragged across\r\nthe Isthmus, he ordered them to anchor at Lechaeum; while he went in\r\nhaste with his friends to Argos to attend the Nemean festival. Just as\r\nhe was engaged in watching the gymnastic contest, a courier arrived\r\nfrom Macedonia with news of the Romans having been defeated in a great\r\nbattle, and of Hannibal being in possession of the open country.\r\nPhilip showed the letter to no one at the moment, except to Demetrius\r\nof Pharos, enjoining him not to say a word. The latter seized the\r\noccasion to advise Philip to throw over the war against the Aetolians\r\nas soon as possible; and to concentrate his efforts upon Illyria,\r\nand an expedition into Italy. “For Greece,” said he, “is already\r\nentirely obedient to you, and will remain so: the Achaeans from genuine\r\naffection; the Aetolians from the terror which their disasters in the\r\npresent war have inspired them. Italy, and your crossing into it, is\r\nthe first step in the acquirement of universal empire, to which no one\r\nhas a better claim than yourself. And now is the moment to act when the\r\nRomans have suffered a reverse.”\r\n\r\n+102.+ By using such arguments he found no difficulty in firing\r\nPhilip’s ambition: as was natural, I think, considering that he was\r\nbut a youthful monarch, who had as yet been successful in all his\r\nundertakings, and was in any case of a singularly daring character;\r\nand considering too that he was sprung from a family which above all\r\nfamilies has somehow a tendency to aim at universal monarchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Zacynthus visited by Philip.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A peace congress summoned.]\r\n\r\nAt the moment then, as I said, Philip communicated the news conveyed\r\nby the letter to Demetrius alone; and afterwards summoning a council\r\nof his friends consulted them on the subject of making peace with the\r\nAetolians. And when even Aratus professed no disinclination to the\r\nmeasure, on the ground that they would be making peace as conquerors,\r\nthe king without waiting for the ambassadors, who were officially\r\nengaged in negotiating its terms, sent Cleonicus of Naupactus at once\r\nto Aetolia, whom he found still awaiting the meeting of the Achaean\r\nleague after his captivity;[286] while he himself, taking his ships and\r\nland force from Corinth, came with it to Aegium. Thence he advanced\r\nas far as Lasion and took the Tower in Perippia, and pretended, in\r\norder to avoid appearing too eager for the conclusion of the war, that\r\nhe was meditating an invasion of Elis. By this time Cleonicus had\r\nbeen backwards and forwards two or three times; and as the Aetolians\r\nbegged that he would meet them personally in conference, he assented,\r\nand abandoning all warlike measures, he sent couriers to the allied\r\ncities, bidding their commissioners to sit in the conference with him\r\nand take part in the discussion of the terms of peace: and then crossed\r\nover with his army and encamped near Panormus, which is a harbour of\r\nthe Peloponnese, and lies exactly opposite Naupactus. There he waited\r\nfor the commissioners from the allies, and employed the time required\r\nfor their assembling in sailing to Zacynthus, and settling on his own\r\nauthority the affairs of the island; and having done so he sailed back\r\nto Panormus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip goes to Naupactus.]\r\n\r\n+103.+ The commissioners having now assembled, Philip sent Aratus and\r\nTaurion, and some others who had come with them, to the Aetolians. They\r\nfound them in full assembly at Naupactus; and after a short conference\r\nwith them, and satisfying themselves as to their inclination for peace,\r\nthey sailed back to Philip to inform him of the state of the case.\r\nBut the Aetolians, being very eager to bring the war to a conclusion,\r\nsent ambassadors with them to Philip urging him to visit them with his\r\narmy, that by a personal conference the business might be brought to\r\na satisfactory conclusion. Moved by these representations, the king\r\nsailed across with his army to what is called the Hollows of Naupactus,\r\nabout twenty stades from the town. Having pitched a camp there, and\r\nhaving caused both it and his ships to be surrounded by a palisade,\r\nhe waited for the time fixed for the interview. The Aetolians came\r\n_en masse_ without arms; and keeping at a distance of two stades from\r\nPhilip’s camp, interchanged messages and discussions on the subjects\r\nin question. The negotiation was begun by the king sending all the\r\ncommissioners of the allies, with instructions to offer the Aetolians\r\npeace, on the condition of both parties retaining what they then held.\r\nThis preliminary the Aetolians readily agreed to; and then there began\r\na continuous interchange of messages between the two, most of which I\r\nshall omit as containing no point of interest: but I shall record the\r\nspeech made by Agelaus of Naupactus in the first conference before the\r\nking and the assembled allies. It was this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Agelaus of Naupactus foreshadowing the Roman\r\nconquest.]\r\n\r\n+104.+ “The best thing of all is that the Greeks should not go to war\r\nwith each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all\r\nspeaking with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a\r\nstream, they may be able to repel the attacks of barbarians and save\r\nthemselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible,\r\nin the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our\r\nguard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions\r\nassumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one\r\nwho pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the\r\nCarthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it\r\nis in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with\r\nthe empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend\r\ntheir forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I\r\nbeseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis,\r\nand above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy\r\nof weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the\r\ninvader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for\r\nyour own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as\r\npart and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the\r\nGreeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your\r\nundertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs\r\nagainst you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you\r\nare eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts\r\ndwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events\r\nthere, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor\r\nis the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of\r\nyou to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time\r\nof greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the\r\npower of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once\r\nyou allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I\r\nfear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word\r\nall these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so\r\ncompletely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying\r\nheaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each\r\nother at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The peace is ratified.]\r\n\r\n+105.+ This speech of Agelaus greatly influenced the allies in favour\r\nof peace; and Philip more than any one: as the arguments employed\r\nchimed in with the wishes which the advice of Demetrius had already\r\nroused in him. Both parties therefore came to terms on the details of\r\nthe treaty; and after ratifying it, separated to their several cities,\r\ntaking peace with them instead of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Olympiad 140, 3. Before July B.C. 217.]\r\n\r\nThese events all fell in the third year of the 140th Olympiad. I mean\r\nthe battle of the Romans in Etruria, that of Antiochus for Coele-Syria,\r\nand lastly the treaty between Philip and the Aetolians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Eastern and Western politics become involved with each\r\nother.]\r\n\r\nThis then was the first point of time, and the first instance of a\r\ndeliberation, which may be said to have regarded the affairs of Greece,\r\nItaly, and Libya as a connected whole: for neither Philip nor the\r\nleading statesmen of the Greek cities made war or peace any longer\r\nwith each other with a view to Greek affairs, but were already all\r\nfixing their eyes upon Italy. Nor was it long before the islanders and\r\ninhabitants of Asia were affected in the same way; for those who were\r\ndispleased with Philip, or who had quarrels with Attalus, no longer\r\nturned to Antiochus or Ptolemy, to the south or the east, but from this\r\ntime forth fixed their eyes on the west, some sending embassies to\r\nCarthage, others to Rome. The Romans similarly began sending legates to\r\nGreece, alarmed at the daring character of Philip, and afraid that he\r\nmight join in the attack upon them in their present critical position.\r\nHaving thus fulfilled my original promise of showing when, how, and why\r\nGreek politics became involved in those of Italy and Libya, I shall now\r\nbring my account of Greek affairs down to the date of the battle of\r\nCannae, to which I have already brought the history of Italy, and will\r\nend this book at that point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Timoxenus Achaean Strategus, May B.C. 216]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Isolation of Athens.]\r\n\r\n+106.+ Directly the Achaeans had put an end to the war, they elected\r\nTimoxenus Strategus for the next year[287] and departed to take up\r\nonce more their regular ways and habits. Along with the Achaeans the\r\nother Peloponnesian communities also set to work to repair the losses\r\nthey had sustained; recommenced the cultivation of the land; and\r\nre-established their national sacrifices, games, and other religious\r\nobservances peculiar to their several states. For these things had all\r\nbut sunk into oblivion in most of the states through the persistent\r\ncontinuance of the late wars. It has ever somehow been the case that\r\nthe Peloponnesians, who of all men are the most inclined to a peaceful\r\nand civilised way of life, have hitherto enjoyed it less than any\r\nother nation in the world; but have been rather as Euripides[288] says\r\n“still worn with toil and war’s unrest.” But to me it seems clear\r\nthat they bring this upon themselves in the natural course of events:\r\nfor their universal desire of supremacy, and their obstinate love of\r\nfreedom, involve them in perpetual wars with each other, all alike\r\nbeing resolutely set upon occupying the first place. The Athenians\r\non the contrary had by this time freed themselves from fear of\r\nMacedonia, and considered that they had now permanently secured their\r\nindependence. They accordingly adopted Eurycleidas and Micion as their\r\nrepresentatives, and took no part whatever in the politics of the rest\r\nof Greece; but following the lead and instigation of these statesmen,\r\nthey laid themselves out to flatter all the kings, and Ptolemy most of\r\nall; nor was there any kind of decree or proclamation too fulsome for\r\ntheir digestion: any consideration of dignity being little regarded,\r\nunder the guidance of these vain and frivolous leaders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Revolt in Egypt.]\r\n\r\n+107.+ Ptolemy however immediately after these events became involved\r\nin a war with his Egyptian subjects. For in arming them for his\r\ncampaign against Antiochus he had taken a step which, while it served\r\nhis immediate purpose sufficiently well, proved eventually disastrous.\r\nElated with their victory at Rhaphia they refused any longer to receive\r\norders from the king; but looked out for a leader to represent them, on\r\nthe ground that they were quite able to maintain their independence.\r\nAnd this they succeeded in doing before very long.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Winter of 217-216 B.C. B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\nAntiochus spent the winter in extensive preparations for war; and when\r\nthe next summer came, he crossed Mount Taurus and after making a treaty\r\nof alliance with King Attalus entered upon the war against Achaeus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discontent of the Aetolians with the peace.]\r\n\r\nAt the time the Aetolians were delighted at the settlement of peace\r\nwith the Achaean league, because the war had not answered to their\r\nwishes; and they accordingly elected Agelaus of Naupactus as their\r\nStrategus, because he was believed to have contributed more largely\r\nthan any one to the success of the negotiations. But this was scarcely\r\narranged before they began to be discontented, and to find fault with\r\nAgelaus for having cut off all their opportunities of plundering\r\nabroad, and all their hopes of gain for the future, since the peace was\r\nnot made with certain definite states, but with all Greeks. But this\r\nstatesman patiently endured these unreasonable reproaches and succeeded\r\nin checking the popular impulse. The Aetolians therefore were forced to\r\nacquiesce in an inactivity quite alien to their nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s war against Scerdilaidas of Illyria, autumn of 217\r\nB.C.]\r\n\r\n+108.+ King Philip having returned, after the completion of the treaty\r\nof peace, to Macedonia by sea, found that Scerdilaidas on the same\r\npretext of money owed to him, on which he had treacherously seized\r\nthe vessels at Leucas, had now plundered a town in Pelagonia called\r\nPissaeum; had won over by promises some cities of the Dassaretae,\r\nnamely, Phibotides, Antipatria, Chrysondym, and Geston; and had overrun\r\nmuch of the district of Macedonia bordering on these places. He\r\ntherefore at once started with his army in great haste to recover the\r\nrevolted cities, and determined to proclaim open war with Scerdilaidas;\r\nfor he thought it a matter of the most vital importance to bring\r\nIllyria into a state of good order, with a view to the success of all\r\nhis projects, and above all of his passage into Italy. For Demetrius\r\nwas so assiduous in keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king’s\r\nmind, that Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of\r\nnothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of Demetrius\r\nin so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for he certainly\r\ndid not rank higher than third in the calculations of Demetrius. A\r\nstronger motive than that was his hatred of Rome: but the strongest\r\nof all was the consideration of his own prospects. For he had made\r\nup his mind that it was only in this way that he could ever recover\r\nhis principality in Pharos. Be that as it may, Philip went on his\r\nexpedition and recovered the cities I have named, and took besides\r\nCreonium and Gerus in Dassaretis; Enchelanae, Cerax, Sation, Boei,\r\nround the Lychnidian Lake; Bantia in the district of the Calicoeni; and\r\nOrgyssus in that of the Pisantini. After completing these operations he\r\ndismissed his troops to their winter quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217-216.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216. Coss. Caius Terentius Varro and Lucius Aemilius\r\nPaulus II.]\r\n\r\nThis was the winter in which Hannibal, after plundering the fairest\r\ndistricts of Italy, intended to place his winter quarters near Geranium\r\nin Daunia. And it was then that at Rome Caius Terentius and Lucius\r\nAemilius entered upon their Consulship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s preparation for an invasion of Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\n+109.+ In the course of the winter, Philip, taking into consideration\r\nthat he would want ships to carry out his designs, and men for rowing,\r\nnot for fighting,—for he could never have even entertained a hope of\r\nfighting the Romans at sea,—but rather for the transport of soldiers,\r\nand to enable him to cross with greater speed to any point to which he\r\nmight desire to go, and so surprise the enemy by a sudden appearance,\r\nand thinking that the Illyrian build was the best for the sort of ships\r\nhe wanted, determined to have a hundred galleys built; which hardly any\r\nMacedonian king had ever done before. Having had these fitted out, he\r\ncollected his forces at the beginning of the summer; and, after a brief\r\ntraining of the Macedonians in rowing them, put to sea. It was just at\r\nthe time that Antiochus crossed Mount Taurus when Philip, after sailing\r\nthrough the Euripus and rounding Cape Malea, came to Cephallenia and\r\nLeucas, where he dropped anchor, and awaited anxiously the movements of\r\nthe Roman fleet. Being informed that it was at anchor off Lilybaeum, he\r\nmustered up courage to put to sea, and steered for Apollonia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Panic-stricken at the reported approach of a Roman squadron,\r\nPhilip retreats to Cephallenia.]\r\n\r\n+110.+ As he neared the mouth of the Aous, which flows past Apollonia,\r\na panic fell upon his fleet such as happens to land forces. Certain\r\ngalleys on the rear of the fleet being anchored at an island called\r\nSason, which lies at the entrance to the Ionian Sea, came by night\r\nto Philip with a report that some men who had lately come from the\r\nSicilian Strait had been anchored with them at Sason, who reported\r\nthat they left some Roman quinqueremes at Rhegium, which were bound\r\nfor Apollonia to support Scerdilaidas. Thinking this fleet must be all\r\nbut upon him, Philip, in great alarm, promptly ordered his ships to\r\nweigh anchor and sail back the way they came. They started and got out\r\nto sea in great disorder, and reached Cephallenia, after sailing two\r\nnights and days without intermission. Having now partially recovered\r\nhis courage, Philip remained there, covering his flight under the\r\npretext of having returned for some operations in the Peloponnese. It\r\nturned out that it was a false alarm altogether. The truth was that\r\nScerdilaidas, hearing in the course of the winter that Philip was\r\nhaving a number of galleys built, and expecting him to come to attack\r\nhim by sea, had sent messages to Rome stating the facts and imploring\r\nhelp; and the Romans had detached a squadron of ten ships from the\r\nfleet at Lilybaeum, which were what had been seen at Rhegium. But if\r\nPhilip had not fled from them in such inconsiderate alarm, he would\r\nhave had the best opportunity possible of attaining his objects in\r\nIllyria; because the thoughts and resources of Rome were absorbed in\r\nthe war with Hannibal and the battle of Cannae, and it may fairly be\r\npresumed that he would have captured the ten Roman ships. As it was, he\r\nwas utterly upset by the news and returned to Macedonia, without loss\r\nindeed, but with considerable dishonour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prusias and the Gauls. See ch. 78.]\r\n\r\n+111.+ During this period Prusias also did a thing which deserves to be\r\nrecorded. The Gauls, whom King Attalus had brought over from Europe to\r\nassist him against Achaeus on account of their reputation for courage,\r\nhad separated from that monarch on account of the jealous suspicions\r\nof which I have before spoken, and were plundering the cities on\r\nthe Hellespont with gross licentiousness and violence, and finally\r\nwent so far as actually to besiege Ilium. In these circumstances the\r\ninhabitants of the Alexandria in the Troad acted with commendable\r\nspirit. They sent Themistes with four thousand men and forced the\r\nGauls to raise the siege of Ilium, and drove them entirely out of the\r\nTroad, by cutting off their supplies and frustrating all their designs.\r\nThereupon the Gauls seized Arisba, in the territory of Abydos, and\r\nthenceforth devoted themselves to forming designs and committing acts\r\nof hostility against the cities built in that district. Against them\r\nPrusias led out an army; and in a pitched battle put the men to the\r\nsword on the field, and slew nearly all their women and children in\r\nthe camp, leaving the baggage to be plundered by his soldiers. This\r\nachievement of Prusias delivered the cities on the Hellespont from\r\ngreat fear and danger, and was a signal warning for future generations\r\nagainst barbarians from Europe being over-ready to cross into Asia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 220-216.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs in Greece and Asia. Meanwhile the greater\r\npart of Italy had joined the Carthaginians after the battle of Cannae,\r\nas I have shown before. I will interrupt my narrative at this point,\r\nafter having detailed the events in Asia and Greece, embraced by the\r\n140th Olympiad. In my next book after a brief recapitulation of this\r\nnarrative, I shall fulfil the promise made at the beginning of my work\r\nby recurring to the discussion of the Roman constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n+1.+ I am aware that some will be at a loss to account for my\r\ninterrupting the course of my narrative for the sake of entering upon\r\nthe following disquisition on the Roman constitution. But I think\r\nthat I have already in many passages made it fully evident that this\r\nparticular branch of my work was one of the necessities imposed on\r\nme by the nature of my original design; and I pointed this out with\r\nspecial clearness in the preface which explained the scope of my\r\nhistory. I there stated that the feature of my work which was at once\r\nthe best in itself, and the most instructive to the students of it, was\r\nthat it would enable them to know and fully realise in what manner, and\r\nunder what kind of constitution, it came about that nearly the whole\r\nworld fell under the power of Rome in somewhat less than fifty-three\r\nyears,—an event certainly without precedent. This being my settled\r\npurpose, I could see no more fitting period than the present for making\r\na pause, and examining the truth of the remarks about to be made on\r\nthis constitution. In private life if you wish to satisfy yourself as\r\nto the badness or goodness of particular persons, you would not, if\r\nyou wish to get a genuine test, examine their conduct at a time of\r\nuneventful repose, but in the hour of brilliant success or conspicuous\r\nreverse. For the true test of a perfect man is the power of bearing\r\nwith spirit and dignity violent changes of fortune. An examination\r\nof a constitution should be conducted in the same way: and therefore\r\nbeing unable to find in our day a more rapid or more signal change\r\nthan that which has happened to Rome, I reserved my disquistion on its\r\nconstitution for this place....\r\n\r\nWhat is really educational and beneficial to students of history is\r\nthe clear view of the causes of events, and the consequent power of\r\nchoosing the better policy in a particular case. Now in every practical\r\nundertaking by a state we must regard as the most powerful agent for\r\nsuccess or failure the form of its constitution; for from this as from\r\na fountain-head all conceptions and plans of action not only proceed,\r\nbut attain their consummation.[289]...\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+3.+ Of the Greek republics, which have again and again risen to\r\ngreatness and fallen into insignificance, it is not difficult to speak,\r\nwhether we recount their past history or venture an opinion on their\r\nfuture. For to report what is already known is an easy task, nor is it\r\nhard to guess what is to come from our knowledge of what has been. But\r\nin regard to the Romans it is neither an easy matter to describe their\r\npresent state, owing to the complexity of their constitution; nor to\r\nspeak with confidence of their future, from our inadequate acquaintance\r\nwith their peculiar institutions in the past whether affecting their\r\npublic or their private life. It will require then no ordinary\r\nattention and study to get a clear and comprehensive conception of the\r\ndistinctive features of this constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classification of polities.]\r\n\r\nNow, it is undoubtedly the case that most of those who profess to give\r\nus authoritative instruction on this subject distinguish three kinds\r\nof constitutions, which they designate _kingship_, _aristocracy_,\r\n_democracy_. But in my opinion the question might fairly be put to\r\nthem, whether they name these as being the _only_ ones, or as the\r\n_best_. In either case I think they are wrong. For it is plain that\r\nwe must regard as the _best_ constitution that which partakes of all\r\nthese three elements. And this is no mere assertion, but has been\r\nproved by the example of Lycurgus, who was the first to construct a\r\nconstitution—that of Sparta—on this principle. Nor can we admit that\r\nthese are the _only_ forms: for we have had before now examples of\r\nabsolute and tyrannical forms of government, which, while differing as\r\nwidely as possible from kingship, yet appear to have some points of\r\nresemblance to it; on which account all absolute rulers falsely assume\r\nand use, as far as they can, the title of king. Again there have been\r\nmany instances of oligarchical governments having in appearance some\r\nanalogy to aristocracies, which are, if I may say so, as different from\r\nthem as it is possible to be. The same also holds good about democracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Six forms of polity, and their natural cycle.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ I will illustrate the truth of what I say. We cannot hold every\r\nabsolute government to be a kingship, but only that which is accepted\r\nvoluntarily, and is directed by an appeal to reason rather than to\r\nfear and force. Nor again is every oligarchy to be regarded as an\r\naristocracy; the latter exists only where the power is wielded by the\r\njustest and wisest men selected on their merits. Similarly, it is not\r\nenough to constitute a democracy that the whole crowd of citizens\r\nshould have the right to do whatever they wish or propose. But where\r\nreverence to the gods, succour of parents, respect to elders, obedience\r\nto laws, are traditional and habitual, in such communities, if the\r\nwill of the majority prevail, we may speak of the form of government\r\nas a democracy. So then we enumerate six forms of government,—the\r\nthree commonly spoken of which I have just mentioned, and three more\r\nallied forms, I mean _despotism_, _oligarchy_ and _mob-rule_. The\r\nfirst of these arises without artificial aid and in the natural order\r\nof events. Next to this, and produced from it by the aid of art and\r\nadjustment, comes _kingship_; which degenerating into the evil form\r\nallied to it, by which I mean _tyranny_, both are once more destroyed\r\nand _aristocracy_ produced. Again the latter being in the course of\r\nnature perverted to _oligarchy_, and the people passionately avenging\r\nthe unjust acts of their rulers, _democracy_ comes into existence;\r\nwhich again by its violence and contempt of law becomes sheer\r\n_mob-rule_.[290] No clearer proof of the truth of what I say could be\r\nobtained than by a careful observation of the natural origin, genesis,\r\nand decadence of these several forms of government. For it is only by\r\nseeing distinctly how each of them is produced that a distinct view\r\ncan also be obtained of its growth, zenith, and decadence, and the\r\ntime, circumstance, and place in which each of these may be expected to\r\nrecur. This method I have assumed to be especially applicable to the\r\nRoman constitution, because its origin and growth have from the first\r\nfollowed natural causes.\r\n\r\n+5.+ Now the natural laws which regulate the merging of one form of\r\ngovernment into another are perhaps discussed with greater accuracy\r\nby Plato and some other philosophers. But their treatment, from its\r\nintricacy and exhaustiveness, is only within the capacity of a few. I\r\nwill therefore endeavour to give a summary of the subject, just so far\r\nas I suppose it to fall within the scope of a practical history and the\r\nintelligence of ordinary people. For if my exposition appear in any way\r\ninadequate, owing to the general terms in which it is expressed, the\r\ndetails contained in what is immediately to follow will amply atone for\r\nwhat is left for the present unsolved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the social compact.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the origin then of a constitution, and whence is it produced?\r\nSuppose that from floods, pestilences, failure of crops, or some such\r\ncauses the race of man is reduced almost to extinction. Such things\r\nwe are told have happened, and it is reasonable to think will happen\r\nagain. Suppose accordingly all knowledge of social habits and arts\r\nto have been lost. Suppose that from the survivors, as from seeds,\r\nthe race of man to have again multiplied. In that case I presume they\r\nwould, like the animals, herd together; for it is but reasonable to\r\nsuppose that bodily weakness would induce them to seek those of their\r\nown kind to herd with. And in that case too, as with the animals,\r\nhe who was superior to the rest in strength of body or courage of\r\nsoul would lead and rule them. For what we see happen in the case of\r\nanimals that are without the faculty of reason, such as bulls, goats,\r\nand cocks,—among whom there can be no dispute that the strongest take\r\nthe lead,—that we must regard as in the truest sense the teaching of\r\nnature. Originally then it is probable that the condition of life among\r\nmen was this,—herding together like animals and following the strongest\r\nand bravest as leaders. The limit of this authority would be physical\r\nstrength, and the name we should give it would be despotism. But as\r\nsoon as the idea of family ties and social relation has arisen amongst\r\nsuch agglomerations of men, then is born also the idea of kingship, and\r\nthen for the first time mankind conceives the notion of goodness and\r\njustice and their reverse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of morality.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: which transmutes despotism into kingship,]\r\n\r\n+6.+ The way in which such conceptions originate and come into\r\nexistence is this. The intercourse of the sexes is an instinct of\r\nnature, and the result is the birth of children. Now, if any one of\r\nthese children who have been brought up, when arrived at maturity,\r\nis ungrateful and makes no return to those by whom he was nurtured,\r\nbut on the contrary presumes to injure them by word and deed, it is\r\nplain that he will probably offend and annoy such as are present, and\r\nhave seen the care and trouble bestowed by the parents on the nurture\r\nand bringing up of their children. For seeing that men differ from\r\nthe other animals in being the only creatures possessed of reasoning\r\npowers, it is clear that such a difference of conduct is not likely\r\nto escape their observation; but that they will remark it when it\r\noccurs, and express their displeasure on the spot: because they will\r\nhave an eye to the future, and will reason on the likelihood of the\r\nsame occurring to each of themselves. Again, if a man has been rescued\r\nor helped in an hour of danger, and, instead of showing gratitude to\r\nhis preserver, seeks to do him harm, it is clearly probable that the\r\nrest will be displeased and offended with him, when they know it:\r\nsympathising with their neighbour and imagining themselves in his case.\r\nHence arises a notion in every breast of the meaning and theory of\r\nduty, which is in fact the beginning and end of justice. Similarly,\r\nagain, when any one man stands out as the champion of all in a time of\r\ndanger, and braves with firm courage the onslaught of the most powerful\r\nwild beasts, it is probable that such a man would meet with marks of\r\nfavour and pre-eminence from the common people; while he who acted in\r\na contrary way would fall under their contempt and dislike. From this,\r\nonce more, it is reasonable to suppose that there would arise in the\r\nminds of the multitude a theory of the disgraceful and the honourable,\r\nand of the difference between them; and that one should be sought and\r\nimitated for its advantages, the other shunned. When, therefore, the\r\nleading and most powerful man among his people ever encourages such\r\npersons in accordance with the popular sentiment, and thereby assumes\r\nin the eyes of his subject the appearance of being the distributor to\r\neach man according to his deserts, they no longer obey him and support\r\nhis rule from fear of violence, but rather from conviction of its\r\nutility, however old he may be, rallying round him with one heart and\r\nsoul, and fighting against all who form designs against his government.\r\nIn this way he becomes a _king_ instead of a _despot_ by imperceptible\r\ndegrees, reason having ousted brute courage and bodily strength from\r\ntheir supremacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: which in its turn degenerates into tyranny.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ This then is the natural process of formation among mankind of the\r\nnotion of goodness and justice, and their opposites; and this is the\r\norigin and genesis of genuine kingship; for people do not only keep up\r\nthe government of such men personally, but for their descendants also\r\nfor many generations; from the conviction that those who are born from\r\nand educated by men of this kind will have principles also like theirs.\r\nBut if they subsequently become displeased with their descendants, they\r\ndo not any longer decide their choice of rulers and kings by their\r\nphysical strength or brute courage; but by the differences of their\r\nintellectual and reasoning faculties, from practical experience of the\r\ndecisive importance of such a distinction. In old times, then, those\r\nwho were once thus selected, and obtained this office, grew old in\r\ntheir royal functions, making magnificent strongholds and surrounding\r\nthem with walls and extending their frontiers, partly for the security\r\nof their subjects, and partly to provide them with abundance of the\r\nnecessaries of life; and while engaged in these works they were exempt\r\nfrom all vituperation or jealousy; because they did not make their\r\ndistinctive dress, food, or drink, at all conspicuous, but lived very\r\nmuch like the rest, and joined in the everyday employments of the\r\ncommon people. But when their royal power became hereditary in their\r\nfamily, and they found every necessary for security ready to their\r\nhands, as well as more than was necessary for their personal support,\r\nthen they gave the rein to their appetites; imagined that rulers must\r\nneeds wear different clothes from those of subjects; have different and\r\nelaborate luxuries of the table; and must even seek sensual indulgence,\r\nhowever unlawful the source, without fear of denial. These things\r\nhaving given rise in the one case to jealousy and offence, in the other\r\nto outburst of hatred and passionate resentment, the kingship became a\r\ntyranny; the first step in disintegration was taken; and plots began to\r\nbe formed against the government, which did not now proceed from the\r\nworst men but from the noblest, most high-minded, and most courageous,\r\nbecause these are the men who can least submit to the tyrannical acts\r\nof their rulers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tyranny is then displaced by aristocracy,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: which degenerates into oligarchy,]\r\n\r\n+8.+ But as soon as the people got leaders, they co-operated with\r\nthem against the dynasty for the reasons I have mentioned; and\r\nthen _kingship_ and _despotism_ were alike entirely abolished, and\r\n_aristocracy_ once more began to revive and start afresh. For in\r\ntheir immediate gratitude to those who had deposed the despots, the\r\npeople employed them as leaders, and entrusted their interests to\r\nthem; who, looking upon this charge at first as a great privilege,\r\nmade the public advantage their chief concern, and conducted all kinds\r\nof business, public or private, with diligence and caution. But when\r\nthe sons of these men received the same position of authority from\r\ntheir fathers,—having had no experience of misfortunes, and none at\r\nall of civil equality and freedom of speech, but having been bred up\r\nfrom the first under the shadow of their fathers’ authority and lofty\r\nposition,—some of them gave themselves up with passion to avarice\r\nand unscrupulous love of money, others to drinking and the boundless\r\ndebaucheries which accompanies it, and others to the violation of\r\nwomen or the forcible appropriation of boys; and so they turned an\r\n_aristocracy_ into an _oligarchy_. But it was not long before they\r\nroused in the minds of the people the same feelings as before; and\r\ntheir fall therefore was very like the disaster which befell the\r\ntyrants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: which is replaced by democracy,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: which degenerates into rule of corruption and violence, only\r\nto be stopped by a return to despotism.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ For no sooner had the knowledge of the jealousy and hatred\r\nexisting in the citizens against them emboldened some one to oppose\r\nthe government by word or deed, than he was sure to find the whole\r\npeople ready and prepared to take his side. Having then got rid of\r\nthese rulers by assassination or exile, they do not venture to set up\r\na king again, being still in terror of the injustice to which this led\r\nbefore; nor dare they intrust the common interests again to more than\r\none, considering the recent example of their misconduct: and therefore,\r\nas the only sound hope left them is that which depends upon themselves,\r\nthey are driven to take refuge in that; and so changed the constitution\r\nfrom an oligarchy to a _democracy_, and took upon themselves the\r\nsuperintendence and charge of the state. And as long as any survive\r\nwho have had experience of oligarchical supremacy and domination, they\r\nregard their present constitution as a blessing, and hold equality and\r\nfreedom as of the utmost value. But as soon as a new generation has\r\narisen, and the democracy has descended to their children’s children,\r\nlong association weakens their value for equality and freedom, and\r\nsome seek to become more powerful than the ordinary citizens; and the\r\nmost liable to this temptation are the rich. So when they begin to\r\nbe fond of office, and find themselves unable to obtain it by their\r\nown unassisted efforts and their own merits, they ruin their estates,\r\nwhile enticing and corrupting the common people in every possible way.\r\nBy which means when, in their senseless mania for reputation, they\r\nhave made the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue\r\nof democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government\r\nof violence and the strong hand. For the mob, habituated to feed at\r\nthe expense of others, and to have its hopes of a livelihood in the\r\nproperty of its neighbours, as soon as it has got a leader sufficiently\r\nambitious and daring, being excluded by poverty from the sweets of\r\ncivil honours, produces a reign of mere violence. Then come tumultuous\r\nassemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land; until, after\r\nlosing all trace of civilisation, it has once more found a master and a\r\ndespot.\r\n\r\nThis is the regular cycle of constitutional revolutions, and the\r\nnatural order in which constitutions change, are transformed, and\r\nreturn again to their original stage. If a man have a clear grasp of\r\nthese principles he may perhaps make a mistake as to the dates at\r\nwhich this or that will happen to a particular constitution; but he\r\nwill rarely be entirely mistaken as to the stage of growth or decay\r\nat which it has arrived, or as to the point at which it will undergo\r\nsome revolutionary change. However, it is in the case of the Roman\r\nconstitution that this method of inquiry will most fully teach us its\r\nformation, its growth, and zenith, as well as the changes awaiting it\r\nin the future; for this, if any constitution ever did, owed, as I said\r\njust now, its original foundation and growth to natural causes, and to\r\nnatural causes will owe its decay. My subsequent narrative will be the\r\nbest illustration of what I say.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lycurgus recognized these truths, and legislated\r\naccordingly.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ For the present I will make a brief reference to the legislation\r\nof Lycurgus: for such a discussion is not at all alien to my subject.\r\nThat statesman was fully aware that all those changes which I have\r\nenumerated come about by an undeviating law of nature; and reflected\r\nthat every form of government that was unmixed, and rested on one\r\nspecies of power, was unstable; because it was swiftly perverted\r\ninto that particular form of evil peculiar to it and inherent in\r\nits nature. For just as rust is the natural dissolvent of iron,\r\nwood-worms and grubs to timber, by which they are destroyed without\r\nany external injury, but by that which is engendered in themselves;\r\nso in each constitution there is naturally engendered a particular\r\nvice inseparable from it: in kingship it is absolutism; aristocracy\r\nit is oligarchy; in democracy lawless ferocity and violence; and to\r\nthese vicious states all these forms of government are, as I have\r\nlately shown, inevitably transformed. Lycurgus, I say, saw all this,\r\nand accordingly combined together all the excellences and distinctive\r\nfeatures of the best constitutions, that no part should become unduly\r\npredominant, and be perverted into its kindred vice; and that, each\r\npower being checked by the others, no one part should turn the scale\r\nor decisively out-balance the others; but that, by being accurately\r\nadjusted and in exact equilibrium, the whole might remain long steady\r\nlike a ship sailing close to the wind. The royal power was prevented\r\nfrom growing insolent by fear of the people, which had also assigned to\r\nit an adequate share in the constitution. The people in their turn were\r\nrestrained from a bold contempt of the kings by fear of the Gerusia:\r\nthe members of which, being selected on grounds of merit, were certain\r\nto throw their influence on the side of justice in every question that\r\narose; and thus the party placed at a disadvantage by its conservative\r\ntendency was always strengthened and supported by the weight and\r\ninfluence of the Gerusia. The result of this combination has been that\r\nthe Lacedaemonians retained their freedom for the longest period of any\r\npeople with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nLycurgus however established his constitution without the discipline of\r\nadversity, because he was able to foresee by the light of reason the\r\ncourse which events naturally take and the source from which they come.\r\nBut though the Romans have arrived at the same result in framing their\r\ncommonwealth, they have not done so by means of abstract reasoning, but\r\nthrough many struggles and difficulties, and by continually adopting\r\nreforms from knowledge gained in disaster. The result has been a\r\nconstitution like that of Lycurgus, and the best of any existing in my\r\ntime....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+11.+ I have given an account of the constitution of Lycurgus, I\r\nwill now endeavour to describe that of Rome at the period of their\r\ndisastrous defeat at Cannae.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman constitution at the epoch of Cannae, B.C. 216.]\r\n\r\nI am fully conscious that to those who actually live under this\r\nconstitution I shall appear to give an inadequate account of it by\r\nthe omission of certain details. Knowing accurately every portion\r\nof it from personal experience, and from having been bred up in its\r\ncustoms and laws from childhood, they will not be struck so much by\r\nthe accuracy of the description, as annoyed by its omissions; nor will\r\nthey believe that the historian has purposely omitted unimportant\r\ndistinctions, but will attribute his silence upon the origin of\r\nexisting institutions or other important facts to ignorance. What is\r\ntold they depreciate as insignificant or beside the purpose; what is\r\nomitted they desiderate as vital to the question: their object being\r\nto appear to know more than the writers. But a good critic should not\r\njudge a writer by what he leaves unsaid, but from what he says: if\r\nhe detects misstatement in the latter, he may then feel certain that\r\nignorance accounts for the former; but if what he says is accurate,\r\nhis omissions ought to be attributed to deliberate judgment and not to\r\nignorance. So much for those whose criticisms are prompted by personal\r\nambition rather than by justice....\r\n\r\nAnother requisite for obtaining a judicious approval for an historical\r\ndisquisition, is that it should be germane to the matter in hand; if\r\nthis is not observed, though its style may be excellent and its matter\r\nirreproachable, it will seem out of place, and disgust rather than\r\nplease....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Triple element in the Roman Constitution.]\r\n\r\nAs for the Roman constitution, it had three elements, each of them\r\npossessing sovereign powers: and their respective share of power in\r\nthe whole state had been regulated with such a scrupulous regard to\r\nequality and equilibrium, that no one could say for certain, not even\r\na native, whether the constitution as a whole were an aristocracy\r\nor democracy or despotism. And no wonder: for if we confine our\r\nobservation to the power of the Consuls we should be inclined to regard\r\nit as despotic; if on that of the Senate, as aristocratic; and if\r\nfinally one looks at the power possessed by the people it would seem a\r\nclear case of a democracy. What the exact powers of these several parts\r\nwere, and still, with slight modifications, are, I will now state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consuls.]\r\n\r\n+12.+ The Consuls, before leading out the legions, remain in Rome and\r\nare supreme masters of the administration. All other magistrates,\r\nexcept the Tribunes, are under them and take their orders. They\r\nintroduce foreign ambassadors to the Senate; bring matters requiring\r\ndeliberation before it; and see to the execution of its decrees. If,\r\nagain, there are any matters of state which require the authorisation\r\nof the people, it is their business to see to them, to summon the\r\npopular meetings, to bring the proposals before them, and to carry out\r\nthe decrees of the majority. In the preparations for war also, and in\r\na word in the entire administration of a campaign, they have all but\r\nabsolute power. It is competent to them to impose on the allies such\r\nlevies as they think good, to appoint the Military Tribunes, to make\r\nup the roll for soldiers and select those that are suitable. Besides\r\nthey have absolute power of inflicting punishment on all who are under\r\ntheir command while on active service and they have authority to expend\r\nas much of the public money as they choose, being accompanied by a\r\nquaestor who is entirely at their orders. A survey of these powers\r\nwould in fact justify our describing the constitution as despotic,—a\r\nclear case of royal government. Nor will it affect the truth of my\r\ndescription, if any of the institutions I have described are changed in\r\nour time, or in that of our posterity: and the same remarks apply to\r\nwhat follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ The Senate has first of all the control of the treasury, and\r\nregulates the receipts and disbursements alike. For the Quaestors\r\ncannot issue any public money for the various departments of the state\r\nwithout a decree of the Senate, except for the service of the Consuls.\r\nThe Senate controls also what is by far the largest and most important\r\nexpenditure, that, namely, which is made by the censors every _lustrum_\r\nfor the repair or construction of public buildings; this money cannot\r\nbe obtained by the censors except by the grant of the Senate. Similarly\r\nall crimes committed in Italy requiring a public investigation, such\r\nas treason, conspiracy, poisoning, or wilful murder, are in the hands\r\nof the Senate. Besides, if any individual or state among the Italian\r\nallies requires a controversy to be settled, a penalty to be assessed,\r\nhelp or protection to be afforded,—all this is the province of the\r\nSenate. Or again, outside Italy, if it is necessary to send an embassy\r\nto reconcile warring communities, or to remind them of their duty,\r\nor sometimes to impose requisitions upon them, or to receive their\r\nsubmission, or finally to proclaim war against them,—this too is the\r\nbusiness of the Senate. In like manner the reception to be given to\r\nforeign ambassadors in Rome, and the answers to be returned to them,\r\nare decided by the Senate. With such business the people have nothing\r\nto do. Consequently, if one were staying at Rome when the Consuls\r\nwere not in town, one would imagine the constitution to be a complete\r\naristocracy: and this has been the idea entertained by many Greeks, and\r\nby many kings as well, from the fact that nearly all the business they\r\nhad with Rome was settled by the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The people.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ After this one would naturally be inclined to ask what part\r\nis left for the people in the constitution, when the Senate has\r\nthese various functions, especially the control of the receipts and\r\nexpenditure of the exchequer; and when the Consuls, again, have\r\nabsolute power over the details of military preparation, and an\r\nabsolute authority in the field? There is, however, a part left the\r\npeople, and it is a most important one. For the people is the sole\r\nfountain of honour and of punishment; and it is by these two things\r\nand these alone that dynasties and constitutions and, in a word, human\r\nsociety are held together: for where the distinction between them is\r\nnot sharply drawn both in theory and practice, there no undertaking\r\ncan be properly administered,—as indeed we might expect when good and\r\nbad are held in exactly the same honour. The people then are the only\r\ncourt to decide matters of life and death; and even in cases where the\r\npenalty is money, if the sum to be assessed is sufficiently serious,\r\nand especially when the accused have held the higher magistracies. And\r\nin regard to this arrangement there is one point deserving especial\r\ncommendation and record. Men who are on trial for their lives at\r\nRome, while sentence is in process of being voted,—if even only one\r\nof the tribes whose votes are needed to ratify the sentence has not\r\nvoted,—have the privilege at Rome of openly departing and condemning\r\nthemselves to a voluntary exile. Such men are safe at Naples or\r\nPraeneste or at Tibur, and at other towns with which this arrangement\r\nhas been duly ratified on oath.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is the people who bestow offices on the deserving, which\r\nare the most honourable rewards of virtue. It has also the absolute\r\npower of passing or repealing laws; and, most important of all, it is\r\nthe people who deliberate on the question of peace or war. And when\r\nprovisional terms are made for alliance, suspension of hostilities, or\r\ntreaties, it is the people who ratify them or the reverse.\r\n\r\nThese considerations again would lead one to say that the chief\r\npower in the state was the people’s, and that the constitution was a\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mutual relation of the three.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ Such, then, is the distribution of power between the several\r\nparts of the state. I must now show how each of these several parts\r\ncan, when they choose, oppose or support each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consul dependent on the Senate,]\r\n\r\nThe Consul, then, when he has started on an expedition with the powers\r\nI have described, is to all appearance absolute in the administration\r\nof the business in hand; still he has need of the support both of\r\npeople and Senate, and, without them, is quite unable to bring the\r\nmatter to a successful conclusion. For it is plain that he must have\r\nsupplies sent to his legions from time to time; but without a decree\r\nof the Senate they can be supplied neither with corn, nor clothes,\r\nnor pay, so that all the plans of a commander must be futile, if the\r\nSenate is resolved either to shrink from danger or hamper his plans.\r\nAnd again, whether a Consul shall bring any undertaking to a conclusion\r\nor no depends entirely upon the Senate: for it has absolute authority\r\nat the end of a year to send another Consul to supersede him, or to\r\ncontinue the existing one in his command. Again, even to the successes\r\nof the generals the Senate has the power to add distinction and glory,\r\nand on the other hand to obscure their merits and lower their credit.\r\nFor these high achievements are brought in tangible form before the\r\neyes of the citizens by what are called “triumphs.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and on the people.]\r\n\r\nBut these triumphs the commanders cannot celebrate with proper pomp, or\r\nin some cases celebrate at all, unless the Senate concurs and grants\r\nthe necessary money. As for the people, the Consuls are pre-eminently\r\nobliged to court their favour, however distant from home may be the\r\nfield of their operations; for it is the people, as I have said before,\r\nthat ratifies, or refuses to ratify, terms of peace and treaties; but\r\nmost of all because when laying down their office they have to give an\r\naccount[291] of their administration before it. Therefore in no case is\r\nit safe for the Consuls to neglect either the Senate or the goodwill of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate controlled by the people.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ As for the Senate, which possesses the immense power I have\r\ndescribed, in the first place it is obliged in public affairs to take\r\nthe multitude into account, and respect the wishes of the people; and\r\nit cannot put into execution the penalty for offences against the\r\nrepublic, which are punishable with death, unless the people first\r\nratify its decrees. Similarly even in matters which directly affect the\r\nsenators,—for instance, in the case of a law diminishing the Senate’s\r\ntraditional authority, or depriving senators of certain dignities and\r\noffices, or even actually cutting down their property,—even in such\r\ncases the people have the sole power of passing or rejecting the law.\r\nBut most important of all is the fact that, if the Tribunes interpose\r\ntheir veto, the Senate not only are unable to pass a decree, but cannot\r\neven hold a meeting at all, whether formal or informal. Now, the\r\nTribunes are always bound to carry out the decree of the people, and\r\nabove all things to have regard to their wishes: therefore, for all\r\nthese reasons the Senate stands in awe of the multitude, and cannot\r\nneglect the feelings of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The people dependent on the Senate]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and Consul.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ In like manner the people on its part is far from being\r\nindependent of the Senate, and is bound to take its wishes into account\r\nboth collectively and individually. For contracts, too numerous\r\nto count, are given out by the censors in all parts of Italy for\r\nthe repairs or construction of public buildings; there is also the\r\ncollection of revenue from many rivers, harbours, gardens, mines, and\r\nland—everything, in a word, that comes under the control of the Roman\r\ngovernment: and in all these the people at large are engaged; so that\r\nthere is scarcely a man, so to speak, who is not interested either as\r\na contractor or as being employed in the works. For some purchase the\r\ncontracts from the censors for themselves; and others go partners with\r\nthem; while others again go security for these contractors, or actually\r\npledge their property to the treasury for them. Now over all these\r\ntransactions the Senate has absolute control. It can grant an extension\r\nof time; and in case of unforeseen accident can relieve the contractors\r\nfrom a portion of their obligation, or release them from it altogether,\r\nif they are absolutely unable to fulfil it. And there are many details\r\nin which the Senate can inflict great hardships, or, on the other hand,\r\ngrant great indulgences to the contractors: for in every case the\r\nappeal is to it. But the most important point of all is that the judges\r\nare taken from its members in the majority of trials, whether public\r\nor private, in which the charges are heavy.[292] Consequently, all\r\ncitizens are much at its mercy; and being alarmed at the uncertainty as\r\nto when they may need its aid, are cautious about resisting or actively\r\nopposing its will. And for a similar reason men do not rashly resist\r\nthe wishes of the Consuls, because one and all may become subject to\r\ntheir absolute authority on a campaign.\r\n\r\n+18.+ The result of this power of the several estates for mutual\r\nhelp or harm is a union sufficiently firm for all emergencies, and a\r\nconstitution than which it is impossible to find a better. For whenever\r\nany danger from without compels them to unite and work together,\r\nthe strength which is developed by the State is so extraordinary,\r\nthat everything required is unfailingly carried out by the eager\r\nrivalry shown by all classes to devote their whole minds to the need\r\nof the hour, and to secure that any determination come to should\r\nnot fail for want of promptitude; while each individual works,\r\nprivately and publicly alike, for the accomplishment of the business\r\nin hand. Accordingly, the peculiar constitution of the State makes\r\nit irresistible, and certain of obtaining whatever it determines to\r\nattempt. Nay, even when these external alarms are past, and the people\r\nare enjoying their good fortune and the fruits of their victories, and,\r\nas usually happens, growing corrupted by flattery and idleness, show\r\na tendency to violence and arrogance,—it is in these circumstances,\r\nmore than ever, that the constitution is seen to possess within itself\r\nthe power of correcting abuses. For when any one of the three classes\r\nbecomes puffed up, and manifests an inclination to be contentious\r\nand unduly encroaching, the mutual interdependency of all the three,\r\nand the possibility of the pretensions of any one being checked and\r\nthwarted by the others, must plainly check this tendency: and so the\r\nproper equilibrium is maintained by the impulsiveness of the one part\r\nbeing checked by its fear of the other....\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ROMAN ARMY\r\n\r\n+19.+ After electing the Consuls they proceed to elect military\r\ntribunes,—fourteen from those who had five years', and ten from those\r\nwho had ten years', service. All citizens must serve ten years in the\r\ncavalry or twenty years in the infantry before the forty-sixth year of\r\ntheir age, except those rated below four hundred asses. The latter are\r\nemployed in the navy; but if any great public necessity arises they\r\nare obliged to serve as infantry also for twenty campaigns: and no one\r\ncan hold an office in the state until he has completed ten years of\r\nmilitary service....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The levy.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Consuls are about to enrol the army they give public notice\r\nof the day on which all Roman citizens of military age must appear.\r\nThis is done every year. When the day has arrived, and the citizens fit\r\nfor service are come to Rome and have assembled on the Capitoline, the\r\nfourteen junior tribunes divide themselves, in the order in which they\r\nwere appointed by the people or by the Imperators, into four divisions,\r\nbecause the primary division of the forces thus raised is into four\r\nlegions. The four tribunes first appointed are assigned to the legion\r\ncalled the 1st; the next three to the 2d; the next four to the 3d; and\r\nthe three last to the 4th. Of the ten senior tribunes, the two first\r\nare assigned to the 1st legion; the next three to the 2d; the two next\r\nto the 3d; and the three last to the 4th.\r\n\r\n+20.+ This division and assignment of the tribunes having been settled\r\nin such a way that all four legions have an equal number of officers,\r\nthe tribunes of the several legions take up a separate position and\r\ndraw lots for the tribes one by one; and summon the tribe on whom it\r\nfrom time to time falls. From this tribe they select four young men\r\nas nearly like each other in age and physical strength as possible.\r\nThese four are brought forward, and the tribunes of the first legion\r\npicks out one of them, those of the second another, those of the third\r\nanother, and the fourth has to take the last. When the next four are\r\nselected the tribunes of the second legion have the first choice, and\r\nthose of the first the last. With the next four the tribunes of the\r\nthird legion have the first choice, those of the second the last; and\r\nso on in regular rotation: of which the result is that each legion\r\ngets men of much the same standard. But when they have selected the\r\nnumber prescribed,—which is four thousand two hundred infantry for each\r\nlegion, or at times of special danger five thousand,—they next used to\r\npass men for the cavalry, in old times _after_ the four thousand two\r\nhundred infantry; but now they do it before them, the selection having\r\nbeen made by the censor on the basis of wealth; and they enrol three\r\nhundred for each legion.[293]\r\n\r\n+21.+ The roll having been completed in this manner, the tribunes\r\nbelonging to the several legions muster their men; and selecting one\r\nof the whole body that they think most suitable for the purpose, they\r\ncause him to take an oath that he will obey his officers and do their\r\norders to the best of his ability. And all the others come up and take\r\nthe oath separately, merely affirming that they will do the same as the\r\nfirst man.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Consuls send orders to the magistrates of the\r\nallied cities in Italy, from which they determine that allied troops\r\nare to serve: declaring the number required, and the day and place at\r\nwhich the men selected must appear. The cities then enrol their troops\r\nwith much the same ceremonies as to selection and administration of the\r\noath, and appoint a commander and a paymaster.[294]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fourfold division of the Legionaries.]\r\n\r\nThe Military Tribunes at Rome, after the administering of the oath\r\nto their men, and giving out the day and place at which they are to\r\nappear without arms, for the present dismiss them. When they arrive on\r\nthe appointed day, they first select the youngest and poorest to form\r\nthe _Velites_, the next to them the _Hastati_, while those who are in\r\nthe prime of life they select as _Principes_, and the oldest of all as\r\n_Triarii_. For in the Roman army these divisions, distinct not only\r\nas to their ages and nomenclature, but also as to the manner in which\r\nthey are armed, exist in each legion. The division is made in such\r\nproportions that the senior men, called _Triarii_, should number six\r\nhundred, the _Principes_ twelve hundred, the _Hastati_ twelve hundred,\r\nand that all the rest as the youngest should be reckoned among the\r\n_Velites_. And if the whole number of the legion is more than four\r\nthousand, they vary the numbers of these divisions proportionally,\r\nexcept those of the _Triarii_, which is always the same.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. Arms of the _Velites_.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ The youngest soldiers or _Velites_ are ordered to carry a sword,\r\nspears, and target (_parma_). The target is strongly made, and large\r\nenough to protect the man; being round, with a diameter of three feet.\r\nEach man also wears a head-piece without a crest (_galea_); which he\r\nsometimes covers with a piece of wolf’s skin or something of that kind,\r\nfor the sake both of protection and identification; that the officers\r\nof his company may be able to observe whether he shows courage or the\r\nreverse on confronting dangers. The spear of the velites has a wooden\r\nhaft of about two cubits, and about a finger’s breadth in thickness;\r\nits head is a span long, hammered fine, and sharpened to such an extent\r\nthat it becomes bent the first time it strikes, and cannot be used by\r\nthe enemy to hurl back; otherwise the weapon would be available for\r\nboth sides alike.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Arms of the _Hastati_, _Principes_, and _Triarii_.]\r\n\r\nThe second rank, the _Hastati_, are ordered to have the complete\r\npanoply. This to a Roman means, first, a large shield (_scutum_), the\r\nsurface of which is curved outwards, its breadth two and a half feet,\r\nits length four feet,—though there is also an extra sized shield in\r\nwhich these measures are increased by a palm’s breadth. It consists\r\nof two layers of wood fastened together with bull’s-hide glue; the\r\nouter surface of which is first covered with canvas, then with calf’s\r\nskin, on the upper and lower edges it is bound with iron to resist\r\nthe downward strokes of the sword, and the wear of resting upon the\r\nground. Upon it also is fixed an iron boss (_umbo_), to resist the more\r\nformidable blows of stones and pikes, and of heavy missiles generally.\r\nWith the shield they also carry a sword (_gladius_) hanging down by\r\ntheir right thigh, which is called a Spanish sword.[295] It has an\r\nexcellent point, and can deal a formidable blow with either edge,\r\nbecause its blade is stout and unbending. In addition to these they\r\nhave two _pila_, a brass helmet, and greaves (_ocreae_). Some of the\r\n_pila_ are thick, some fine. Of the thicker, some are round with the\r\ndiameter of a palm’s length, others are a palm square. The fine pila\r\nare like moderate sized hunting spears, and they are carried along with\r\nthe former sort. The wooden haft of them all is about three cubits\r\nlong; and the iron head fixed to each half is barbed, and of the same\r\nlength as the haft. They take extraordinary pains to attach the head\r\nto the haft firmly; they make the fastening of the one to the other\r\nso secure for use by binding it half way up the wood, and riveting\r\nit with a series of clasps, that the iron breaks sooner than this\r\nfastening comes loose, although its thickness at the socket and where\r\nit is fastened to the wood is a finger and a half’s breadth. Besides\r\nthese each man is decorated with a plume of feathers, with three purple\r\nor black feathers standing upright, about a cubit long. The effect of\r\nthese being placed on the helmet, combined with the rest of the armour,\r\nis to give the man the appearance of being twice his real height, and\r\nto give him a noble aspect calculated to strike terror into the enemy.\r\nThe common soldiers also receive a brass plate, a span square, which\r\nthey put upon their breast and call a breastpiece (_pectorale_), and so\r\ncomplete their panoply. Those who are rated above a hundred thousand\r\nasses, instead of these breastpieces wear, with the rest of their\r\narmour, coats of mail (_loricae_). The Principes and Triarii are armed\r\nin the same way as the _Hastati_, except that instead of _pila_ they\r\ncarry long spears (_hastae_).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Election of Centurions.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ The _Principes_, _Hastati_, and _Triarii_, each elect ten\r\ncenturions according to merit, and then a second ten each. All these\r\nsixty have the title of centurion alike, of whom the first man chosen\r\nis a member of the council of war. And they in their turn select a\r\nrear-rank officer each who is called _optio_. Next, in conjunction with\r\nthe centurions, they divide the several orders (omitting the _Velites_)\r\ninto ten companies each, and appoint to each company two centurions\r\nand two _optiones_; the _Velites_ are divided equally among all the\r\ncompanies; these companies are called orders (_ordines_) or maniples\r\n(_manipuli_), or vexilla, and their officers are called centurions or\r\n_ordinum ductores_.[296] Each maniple selects two of their strongest\r\nand best born men as standard-bearers (_vexillarii_). And that each\r\nmaniple should have two commanding officers is only reasonable; for\r\nit being impossible to know what a commander may be doing or what\r\nmay happen to him, and necessities of war admitting of no parleying,\r\nthey are anxious that the maniple may never be without a leader and\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nWhen the two centurions are both on the field, the first elected\r\ncommands the right of the maniple, the second the left: if both are not\r\nthere, the one who is commands the whole. And they wish the centurions\r\nnot to be so much bold and adventurous, as men with a faculty for\r\ncommand, steady, and of a profound rather than a showy spirit; not\r\nprone to engage wantonly or be unnecessarily forward in giving battle;\r\nbut such as in the face of superior numbers and overwhelming pressure\r\nwill die in defence of their post.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Officers and arms of the equites.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ Similarly they divide the cavalry into ten squadrons (_turmae_),\r\nand from each they select three officers (_decuriones_), who each\r\nselect a subaltern (_optio_). The decurio first elected commands the\r\nsquadron, the other two have the rank of _decuriones_: a name indeed\r\nwhich applies to all alike. If the first _decurio_ is not on the\r\nfield, the second takes command of the squadron. The armour of the\r\ncavalry is very like that in Greece. In old times they did not wear\r\nthe lorica, but fought in their tunics (_campestria_); the result of\r\nwhich was that they were prompt and nimble at dismounting and mounting\r\nagain with despatch, but were in great danger at close quarters from\r\nthe unprotected state of their bodies. And their lances too were\r\nuseless in two ways: first because they were thin, and prevented\r\ntheir taking a good aim; and before they could get the head fixed in\r\nthe enemy, the lances were so shaken by the mere motion of the horse\r\nthat they generally broke. Secondly, because, having no spike at the\r\nbutt end of their lance, they only had one stroke, namely that with\r\nthe spear-head; and if the lance broke, what was left in their hands\r\nwas entirely useless. Again they used to have shields of bull’s hide,\r\njust like those round cakes, with a knob in the middle which are used\r\nat sacrifices, which were useless at close quarters because they were\r\nflexible rather than firm; and, when their leather shrunk and rotted\r\nfrom the rain, unserviceable as they were before, they then became\r\nentirely so. Wherefore, as experience showed them the uselessness of\r\nthese, they lost no time in changing to the Greek fashion of arms: the\r\nadvantages of which were, first, that men were able to deliver the\r\nfirst stroke of their lance-head with a good aim and effect, because\r\nthe shaft from the nature of its construction was steady and not\r\nquivering; and, secondly, that they were able, by reversing the lance,\r\nto use the spike at the butt-end for a steady and effective blow. And\r\nthe same may be said about the Greek shields: for, whether used to\r\nward off a blow or to thrust against the enemy, they neither give nor\r\nbend. When the Romans learnt these facts about the Greek arms they were\r\nnot long in copying them; for no nation has ever surpassed them in\r\nreadiness to adopt new fashions from other people, and to imitate what\r\nthey see is better in others than themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assembly of the legions.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Socii.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ Having made this distribution of their men and given orders\r\nfor their being armed, as I have described, the military tribunes\r\ndismiss them to their homes. But when the day has arrived on which\r\nthey were all bound by their oath to appear at the place named by the\r\nConsuls (for each Consul generally appoints a separate place for his\r\nown legions, each having assigned to him two legions and a moiety of\r\nthe allies), all whose names were placed on the roll appear without\r\nfail: no excuse being accepted in the case of those who have taken the\r\noath, except a prohibitory omen or absolute impossibility. The allies\r\nmuster along with the citizens, and are distributed and managed by the\r\nofficers appointed by the Consuls, who have the title of _Praefecti\r\nsociis_ and are twelve in number. These officers select for the Consuls\r\nfrom the whole infantry and cavalry of the allies such as are most\r\nfitted for actual service, and these are called _extraordinarii_ (which\r\nin Greek is ἐπίλεκτοι.) The whole number of the infantry of the socii\r\ngenerally equals that of the legions, but the cavalry is treble that of\r\nthe citizens. Of these they select a third of the cavalry, and a fifth\r\nof the infantry to serve as _extraordinarii_. The rest they divide into\r\ntwo parts, one of which is called the right, the other the left wing\r\n(_alae_).\r\n\r\nThese arrangements made, the military tribunes take over the citizens\r\nand allies and proceed to form a camp. Now the principle on which they\r\nconstruct their camps, no matter when or where, is the same; I think\r\ntherefore that it will be in place here to try and make my readers\r\nunderstand, as far as words can do so, the Roman tactics in regard to\r\nthe march (_agmen_), the camp (_castrorum metatio_), and the line of\r\nbattle (_acies_). I cannot imagine any one so indifferent to things\r\nnoble and great, as to refuse to take some little extra trouble to\r\nunderstand things like these; for if he has once heard them, he will\r\nbe acquainted with one of those things genuinely worth observation and\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Castrorum metatio._]\r\n\r\n+27.+ Their method of laying out a camp is as follows. The place for\r\nthe camp having been selected, the spot in it best calculated to\r\ngive a view of the whole, and most convenient for issuing orders, is\r\nappropriated for the general’s tent (_Praetorium_).\r\n\r\nHaving placed a standard on the spot on which they intend to put the\r\nPraetorium, they measure off a square round this standard, in such\r\na way that each of its sides is a hundred feet from the standard,\r\nand the area of the square is four plethra.[297] Along one side of\r\nthis square—whichever aspect appears most convenient for watering\r\nand foraging—the legions are stationed as follows. I have said that\r\nthere were six Tribuni in each legion, and that each Consul had two\r\nlegions,—it follows that there are twelve _Tribuni_ in a Consular army.\r\nWell, they pitch the tents of these Tribuni all in one straight line,\r\nparallel to the side of the square selected, at a distance of fifty\r\nfeet from it (there is a place too selected for the horses, beasts of\r\nburden, and other baggage of the Tribuni); these tents face the outer\r\nside of the camp and away from the square described above,—a direction\r\nwhich will henceforth be called “the front” by me. The tents of the\r\nTribuni stand at equal distances from each other, so that they extend\r\nalong the whole breadth of the space occupied by the legions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The principia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The quarters.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ From the line described by the front of these tents they measure\r\nanother distance of a hundred feet towards the front. At that distance\r\nanother parallel straight line is drawn, and it is from this last that\r\nthey begin arranging the quarters of the legions, which they do as\r\nfollows:—they bisect the last mentioned straight line and from that\r\npoint draw another straight line at right angles to it; along this\r\nline, on either side of it facing each other, the cavalry of the two\r\nlegions are quartered with a space of fifty feet between them, which\r\nspace is exactly bisected by the line last mentioned. The manner of\r\nencamping the infantry is similar to that of the cavalry. The whole\r\narea of each space occupied by the maniples and squadrons is a square,\r\nand faces the _via_;[298] the length facing the _via_ is one hundred\r\nfeet, and they generally try to make the depth the same, except in\r\nthe case of the socii; and when they are employing legions of an\r\nextra number, they increase the length and depth of these squares\r\nproportionally.\r\n\r\n+29.+ The spaces assigned to the cavalry are opposite the space between\r\nthe two groups of tents belonging to the Tribuni of the two legions,\r\nat right angles to the line along which they stand, like a cross-road;\r\nand indeed the whole arrangement of the _viae_ is like a system of\r\ncross-roads, running on either side of the blocks of tents, those of\r\nthe cavalry on one side and those of the infantry on the other. The\r\nspaces assigned to the cavalry and the Triarii in each legion are back\r\nto back, with no _via_ between them, but touching each other, looking\r\nopposite ways; and the depth of the spaces assigned to the Triarii is\r\nonly half that assigned to other maniples, because their numbers are\r\ngenerally only half; but though the number of the men is different,\r\nthe length of the space is always the same owing to the lesser depth.\r\nNext, parallel with these spaces, at a distance of fifty feet, they\r\nplace the _Principes_ facing the Triarii; and as they face the space\r\nbetween themselves and the _Triarii_, we have two more roads formed\r\nat right angles to the hundred-foot area in front of the tents of the\r\nTribunes, and running down from it to the outer agger of the camp on\r\nthe side opposite to that of the Principia, which we agreed to call\r\nthe front of the camp. Behind the spaces for the _Triarii_ and looking\r\nin the opposite direction, and touching each other, are the spaces\r\nfor the _Hastati_. These several branches of the service (_Triarii_,\r\n_Principes_, _Hastati_), being each divided into ten maniples, the\r\ncross-roads between the blocks are all the same length and terminate in\r\nthe front agger of the camp; towards which they cause the last maniples\r\nin the rows to face.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Via Quintana.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ Beyond the _Hastati_ they again leave a space of fifty feet,\r\nand there, beginning from the same base (the Principia), and going in\r\na parallel direction, and to the same distance as the other blocks,\r\nthey place the cavalry of the allies facing the _Hastati_. Now the\r\nnumber of the allies, as I have stated above, is equal to that of the\r\nlegions in regard to the infantry, though it falls below that if we\r\nomit the _extraordinarii_; but that of the cavalry is double, when\r\nthe third part is deducted for service among the _extraordinarii_.\r\nTherefore in marking out the camp the spaces assigned to the latter\r\nare made proportionally deeper, so that their length remains the same\r\nas those occupied by the legions. Thus five viae are formed:[299] and\r\nback to back with these cavalry are the spaces for the infantry of the\r\nallies, the depth being proportionally increased according to their\r\nnumbers;[300] and these maniples face the outer sides of the camp and\r\nthe agger. In each maniple the first tent at either end is occupied\r\nby the centurions. Between the fifth and sixth squadrons of cavalry,\r\nand the fifth and sixth maniple of infantry, there is a space of fifty\r\nleft, so that another road is made across the camp at right angles to\r\nthe others and parallel to the tents of the Tribuni, and this they call\r\nthe _Via Quintana_, as it runs along the fifth squadrons and maniples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The space between the Principia and the agger.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Staff, or Praetoria cohors.]\r\n\r\n+31.+ The space behind the tents of the Tribuni is thus used. On one\r\nside of the square of the Praetorium is the market, on the other the\r\noffice of the Quaestor and the supplies which he has charge of. Then\r\nbehind the last tent of the Tribuni on either side, arranged at right\r\nangles to those tents, are the quarters of the cavalry picked out of\r\nthe _extraordinarii_, as well as of some of those who are serving as\r\nvolunteers from personal friendship to Consuls. All these are arranged\r\nparallel to the side aggers, facing on the one side the Quaestorium, on\r\nthe other the market-place. And, generally speaking, it falls to the\r\nlot of these men not only to be near the Consul in the camp, but to be\r\nwholly employed about the persons of the Consul and the Quaestor on the\r\nmarch and all other occasions. Back to back with these again, facing\r\nthe agger, are placed the infantry who serve in the same way as these\r\ncavalry.[301]\r\n\r\nBeyond these there is another empty space or road left, one hundred\r\nfeet broad, parallel to the tents of the Tribuni, skirting the\r\nmarket-place, Praetorium, and Quaestorium, from agger to agger. On the\r\nfurther side of this road the rest of the _equites extraordinarii_\r\nare placed facing the market-place and Quaestorium: and between the\r\nquarters of these cavalry of the two legions a passage is left of\r\nfifty feet, exactly opposite and at right angles to the square of the\r\nPraetorium, leading to the rearward agger.\r\n\r\nBack to back with the _equites extraordinarii_ are the infantry of the\r\nsame, facing the agger at the rear of the whole camp. And the space\r\nleft empty on either side of these, facing the agger on each side of\r\nthe camp, is given up to foreigners and such allies as chance to come\r\nto the camp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The space round the quarters.]\r\n\r\nThe result of these arrangements is that the whole camp is a square,\r\nwith streets and other constructions regularly planned like a town.\r\nBetween the line of the tents and the agger there is an empty space\r\nof two hundred feet on every side of the square, which is turned to\r\na great variety of uses. To begin with, it is exceedingly convenient\r\nfor the marching in and out of the legions. For each division descends\r\ninto this space by the _via_ which passes its own quarters, and so\r\navoids crowding and hustling each other, as they would if they were all\r\ncollected on one road. Again, all cattle brought into the camp, as well\r\nas booty of all sorts taken from the enemy, are deposited in this space\r\nand securely guarded during the night-watches. But the most important\r\nuse of this space is that, in night assaults, it secures the tents from\r\nthe danger of being set on fire, and keeps the soldiers out of the\r\nrange of the enemy’s missiles; or, if a few of them do carry so far,\r\nthey are spent and cannot penetrate the tents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provision for extra numbers,]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and for two consular armies.]\r\n\r\n+32.+ The number then of foot-soldiers and cavalry being given (at\r\nthe rate, that is to say, of four thousand or of five thousand for\r\neach legion), and the length, depth, and number of the maniples being\r\nlikewise known, as well as the breadth of the passages and roads, it\r\nbecomes possible to calculate the area occupied by the camp and the\r\nlength of the aggers. If on any occasion the number of allies, either\r\nthose originally enrolled or those who joined subsequently, exceeds\r\ntheir due proportion, the difficulty is provided for in this way. To\r\nthe overplus of allies who joined subsequent to the enrolment of the\r\narmy are assigned the spaces on either side of the Praetorium, the\r\nmarket-place and Quaestorium being proportionally contracted. For the\r\nextra numbers of allies who joined originally an extra line of tents\r\n(forming thus another _via_) is put up parallel with the other tents\r\nof the socii, facing the agger on either side of the camp. But if all\r\nfour legions and both Consuls are in the same camp, all we have to do\r\nis to imagine a second army, arranged back to back to the one already\r\nplaced, in exactly the same spaces as the former, but side by side\r\nwith it at the part where the picked men from the _extraordinarii_ are\r\nstationed facing the rearward agger. In this case the shape of the\r\ncamp becomes an oblong, the area double, and the length of the entire\r\nagger half as much again. This is the arrangement when both Consuls are\r\nwithin the same agger; but if they occupy two separate camps, the above\r\narrangements hold good, except that the market-place is placed half way\r\nbetween the two camps.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guard duty.]\r\n\r\n+33.+ The camp having thus been laid out, the Tribuni next administer\r\nan oath to all in it separately, whether free or slave, that they will\r\nsteal nothing within the agger, and in case they find anything will\r\nbring it to the Tribuni. They next select for their several duties the\r\nmaniples of the Principes and Hastati in each legion. Two are told\r\noff to guard the space in front of the quarters of the Tribuni. For\r\nin this space, which is called the Principia, most of the Romans in\r\nthe camp transact all the business of the day; and are therefore very\r\nparticular about its being kept well watered and properly swept. Of the\r\nother eighteen maniples, three are assigned to each of the six Tribuni,\r\nthat being the respective numbers in each legion; and of these three\r\nmaniples each takes its turn of duty in waiting upon the Tribune. The\r\nservices they render him are such as these: they pitch his tent for\r\nhim when a place is selected for encampment, and level the ground all\r\nround it; and if any extra precaution is required for the protection of\r\nhis baggage, it is their duty to see to it. They also supply him with\r\ntwo relays of guards. A guard consists of four men, two of whom act\r\nas sentries in front of his tent, and two on the rear of it near the\r\nhorses. Seeing that each Tribune has three maniples, and each maniple\r\nhas a hundred men, without counting _Triarii_ and _Velites_ who are\r\nnot liable for this service, the duty is a light one, coming round\r\nto each maniple only once in three days; while by this arrangement\r\nample provision is made for the convenience as well as the dignity of\r\nthe Tribuni. The maniples of Triarii are exempted from this personal\r\nservice to the Tribuni, but they each supply a watch of four men to the\r\nsquadron of cavalry nearest them. These watches have to keep a general\r\nlook out; but their chief duty is to keep an eye upon the horses, to\r\nprevent their hurting themselves by getting entangled in their tethers,\r\nand so becoming unfit for use; or from getting loose, and making a\r\nconfusion and disturbance in the camp by running against other horses.\r\nFinally, all the maniples take turns to mount guard for a day each at\r\nthe Consul’s tent, to protect him from plots, and maintain the dignity\r\nof his office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Orders of the day.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Construction of the _fossa_ and _agger_.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ As to the construction of the foss and vallum,[302] two sides\r\nfall to the lot of the socii, each division taking that side along\r\nwhich it is quartered; the other two are left to the Romans, one to\r\neach legion. Each side is divided into portions according to the number\r\nof maniples, and the centurions stand by and superintend the work of\r\neach maniple; while two of the Tribunes superintend the construction\r\nof the whole side and see that it is adequate. In the same way the\r\nTribunes superintend all other operations in the camp. They divide\r\nthemselves in twos, and each pair is on duty for two months out of six;\r\nthey draw lots for their turns, and the pair on whom the lot falls\r\ntakes the superintendence of all active operations. The prefects of\r\nthe socii divide their duty in the same way. At daybreak the officers\r\nof the cavalry and the centurions muster at the tents of the Tribunes,\r\nwhile the Tribunes go to that of the Consul. He gives the necessary\r\norders to the Tribunes, they to the cavalry officers and centurions,\r\nand these last pass them on to the rank and file as occasion may demand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The watchword.]\r\n\r\nTo secure the passing round of the watchword for the night the\r\nfollowing course is followed. One man is selected from the tenth\r\nmaniple, which, in the case both of cavalry and infantry, is quartered\r\nat the ends of the road between the tents; this man is relieved from\r\nguard-duty and appears each day about sunset at the tent of the Tribune\r\non duty, takes the _tessera_ or wooden tablet on which the watchword\r\nis inscribed, and returns to his own maniple and delivers the wooden\r\ntablet and watchword in the presence of witnesses to the chief officer\r\nof the maniple next his own; he in the same way to the officer of the\r\nnext, and so on, until it arrives at the first maniple stationed next\r\nthe Tribunes. These men are obliged to deliver the tablet (_tessera_)\r\nto the Tribunes before dark. If they are all handed in, the Tribune\r\nknows that the watchword has been delivered to all, and has passed\r\nthrough all the ranks back to his hands: but if any one is missing,\r\nhe at once investigates the matter; for he knows by the marks on the\r\ntablets from which division of the army the tablet has not appeared;\r\nand the man who is discovered to be responsible for its non-appearance\r\nis visited with condign punishment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Night watches.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ Next as to the keeping guard at night. The Consul’s tent is\r\nguarded by the maniple on duty: those of the Tribuni and praefects of\r\nthe cavalry by the pickets formed as described above from the several\r\nmaniples. And in the same way each maniple and squadron posts guards of\r\ntheir own men. The other pickets are posted by the Consul. Generally\r\nspeaking there are three pickets at the Quaestorium, and two at the\r\ntent of each of the legati or members of council. The vallum is lined\r\nby the _velites_, who are on guard all along it from day to day. That\r\nis their special duty; while they also guard all the entrances to the\r\ncamp, telling off ten sentinels to take their turn at each of them. Of\r\nthe men told off for duty at the several _stationes_, the man who in\r\neach maniple is to take the first watch is brought by the rear-rank man\r\nof his company to the Tribune at eventide. The latter hands over to\r\nthem severally small wooden tablets (_tesserae_), one for each watch,\r\ninscribed with small marks; on receiving which they go off to the\r\nplaces indicated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Visiting rounds.]\r\n\r\nThe duty of going the rounds is intrusted to the cavalry. The first\r\nPraefect of cavalry in each legion, early in the morning, orders one\r\nof his rear-rank men to give notice before breakfast to four young men\r\nof his squadron who are to go the rounds. At evening this same man’s\r\nduty is to give notice to the Praefect of the next squadron that it\r\nis his turn to provide for going the rounds until next morning. This\r\nofficer thereupon takes measures similar to the preceding one until\r\nthe next day; and so on throughout the cavalry squadrons. The four\r\nmen thus selected by the rear-rank men from the first squadron, after\r\ndrawing lots for the watch they are to take, proceed to the tent of the\r\nTribune on duty, and receive from him a writing stating the order[303]\r\nand the number of the watches they are to visit. The four then take\r\nup their quarters for the night alongside of the first maniple of\r\nTriarii; for it is the duty of the centurion of this maniple to see\r\nthat a bugle is blown at the beginning of every watch. When the time\r\nhas arrived, the man to whose lot the first watch has fallen goes his\r\nrounds, taking some of his friends as witnesses. He walks through the\r\nposts assigned, which are not only those along the vallum and gates,\r\nbut also the pickets set by the several maniples and squadrons. If he\r\nfind the men of the first watch awake he takes from them their tessera;\r\nbut if he find any one of them asleep or absent from his post, he calls\r\nthose with him to witness the fact and passes on. The same process\r\nis repeated by those who go the rounds during the other watches. The\r\ncharge of seeing that the bugle is blown at the beginning of each\r\nwatch, so that the right man might visit the right pickets, is as I\r\nhave said, laid upon the centurions of the first maniple of Triarii,\r\neach one taking the duty for a day.\r\n\r\nEach of these men who have gone the rounds (_tessarii_) at daybreak\r\nconveys the tesserae to the Tribune on duty. If the whole number are\r\ngiven in they are dismissed without question; but if any of them brings\r\na number less than that of the pickets, an investigation is made by\r\nmeans of the mark on the tessera, as to which picket he has omitted.\r\nUpon this being ascertained the centurion is summoned; he brings the\r\nmen who were on duty, and they are confronted with the patrol. If the\r\nfault is with the men on guard, the patrol clears himself by producing\r\nthe witnesses whom he took with him; for he cannot do so without. If\r\nnothing of that sort happened, the blame recoils upon the patrol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military punishments: the _fustuarium_.]\r\n\r\n+37.+ Then the Tribunes at once hold a court-martial, and the man who\r\nis found guilty is punished by the _fustuarium_; the nature of which\r\nis this. The Tribune takes a cudgel and merely touches the condemned\r\nman; whereupon all the soldiers fall upon him with cudgels and stones.\r\nGenerally speaking men thus punished are killed on the spot; but if by\r\nany chance, after running the gauntlet, they manage to escape from the\r\ncamp, they have no hope of ultimately surviving even so. They may not\r\nreturn to their own country, nor would any one venture to receive such\r\nan one into his house. Therefore those who have once fallen into this\r\nmisfortune are utterly and finally ruined. The same fate awaits the\r\npraefect of the squadron, as well as his rear-rank man, if they fail to\r\ngive the necessary order at the proper time, the latter to the patrols,\r\nand the former to the praefect of the next squadron. The result of the\r\nseverity and inevitableness of this punishment is that in the Roman\r\narmy the night watches are faultlessly kept. The common soldiers are\r\namenable to the Tribunes; the Tribunes to the Consuls. The Tribune is\r\ncompetent to punish a soldier by inflicting a fine, distraining his\r\ngoods, or ordering him to be flogged; so too the praefects in the case\r\nof the socii. The punishment of the _fustuarium_ is assigned also to\r\nany one committing theft in the camp, or bearing false witness: as also\r\nto any one who in full manhood is detected in shameful immorality: or\r\nto any one who has been thrice punished for the same offence. All these\r\nthings are punished as crimes. But such as the following are reckoned\r\nas cowardly and dishonourable in a soldier:—for a man to make a false\r\nreport to the Tribunes of his valour in order to get reward; or for\r\nmen who have been told off to an ambuscade to quit the place assigned\r\nthem from fear; and also for a man to throw away any of his arms from\r\nfear, on the actual field of battle. Consequently it sometimes happens\r\nthat men confront certain death at their stations, because, from their\r\nfear of the punishment awaiting them at home, they refuse to quit their\r\npost: while others, who have lost shield or spear or any other arm on\r\nthe field, throw themselves upon the foe, in hopes of recovering what\r\nthey have lost, or of escaping by death from certain disgrace and the\r\ninsults of their relations.[304]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decimatio.]\r\n\r\n+38.+ But if it ever happens that a number of men are involved in these\r\nsame acts: if, for instance, some entire maniples have quitted their\r\nground in the presence of the enemy, it is deemed impossible to subject\r\nall to the _fustuarium_ or to military execution; but a solution of\r\nthe difficulty has been found at once adequate to the maintenance of\r\ndiscipline and calculated to strike terror. The Tribune assembles the\r\nlegion, calls the defaulters to the front, and, after administering\r\na sharp rebuke, selects five or eight or twenty out of them by lot,\r\nso that those selected should be about a tenth of those who have been\r\nguilty of the act of cowardice. These selected are punished with the\r\n_fustuarium_ without mercy; the rest are put on rations of barley\r\ninstead of wheat, and are ordered to take up their quarters outside the\r\nvallum and the protection of the camp. As all are equally in danger of\r\nhaving the lot fall on them, and as all alike who escape that, are made\r\na conspicuous example of by having their rations of barley, the best\r\npossible means are thus taken to inspire fear for the future, and to\r\ncorrect the mischief which has actually occurred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Military decorations.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mural crown.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civic crown.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ A very excellent plan also is adopted for inducing young soldiers\r\nto brave danger. When an engagement has taken place and any of them\r\nhave showed conspicuous gallantry, the Consul summons an assembly of\r\nthe legion, puts forward those whom he considers to have distinguished\r\nthemselves in any way, and first compliments each of them individually\r\non his gallantry, and mentions any other distinction he may have\r\nearned in the course of his life, and then presents them with gifts:\r\nto the man who has wounded an enemy, a spear; to the man who has\r\nkilled one and stripped his armour, a cup, if he be in the infantry,\r\nhorse-trappings if in the cavalry: though originally the only present\r\nmade was a spear. This does not take place in the event of their\r\nhaving wounded or stripped any of the enemy in a set engagement or\r\nthe storming of a town; but in skirmishes or other occasions of that\r\nsort, in which, without there being any positive necessity for them to\r\nexpose themselves singly to danger, they have done so voluntarily and\r\ndeliberately. In the capture of a town those who are first to mount the\r\nwalls are presented with a gold crown. So too those who have covered\r\nand saved any citizens or allies are distinguished by the Consul with\r\ncertain presents; and those whom they have preserved present them\r\nvoluntarily with a crown, or if not, they are compelled to do so by\r\nthe Tribunes. The man thus preserved, too, reverences his preserver\r\nthroughout his life as a father, and is bound to act towards him as\r\na father in every respect. By such incentives those who stay at home\r\nare stirred up to a noble rivalry and emulation in confronting danger,\r\nno less than those who actually hear and see what takes place. For\r\nthe recipients of such rewards not only enjoy great glory among their\r\ncomrades in the army, and an immediate reputation at home, but after\r\ntheir return they are marked men in all solemn festivals; for they\r\nalone, who have been thus distinguished by the Consuls for bravery,\r\nare allowed to wear robes of honour on those occasions: and moreover\r\nthey place the spoils they have taken in the most conspicuous places in\r\ntheir houses, as visible tokens and proofs of their valour. No wonder\r\nthat a people, whose rewards and punishments are allotted with such\r\ncare and received with such feelings, should be brilliantly successful\r\nin war.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the foot soldier is 5⅓ asses a day; of the centurion 10⅔; of\r\nthe cavalry 16. The infantry receive a ration of wheat equal to about ⅔\r\nof an Attic medimnus a month, and the cavalry 7 medimni of barley, and\r\n2 of wheat; of the allies the infantry receive the same, the cavalry 1⅓\r\nmedimnus of wheat, and 5 of barley. This is a free gift to the allies;\r\nbut in the cases of the Romans, the Quaestor stops out of their pay\r\nthe price of their corn and clothes, or any additional arms they may\r\nrequire at a fixed rate.\r\n\r\n+40.+ The following is their manner of moving camp. At the first\r\nbugle the men all strike their tents and collect their baggage; but\r\nno soldier may strike his tent, or set it up either, till the same\r\nis done to that of the Tribuni and the Consul. At the second bugle\r\nthey load the beasts of burden with their baggage: at the third\r\nthe first maniples must advance and set the whole camp in motion.\r\nGenerally speaking, the men appointed to make this start are the\r\n_extraordinarii_: next comes the right wing of the socii; and behind\r\nthem their beasts of burden. These are followed by the first legion\r\nwith its own baggage immediately on its rear; then comes the second\r\nlegion, followed by its own beasts of burden, and the baggage of those\r\nsocii who have to bring up the rear of the march, that is to say, the\r\nleft wing of the socii. The cavalry sometimes ride on the rear of their\r\nrespective divisions, sometimes on either side of the beasts of burden,\r\nto keep them together and secure them. If an attack is expected on the\r\nrear, the _extraordinarii_ themselves occupy the rear instead of the\r\nvan. Of the two legions and wings each takes the lead in the march on\r\nalternate days, that by this interchange of position all may have an\r\nequal share in the advantage of being first at the water and forage.\r\nThe order of march, however, is different at times of unusual danger,\r\nif they have open ground enough. For in that case they advance in\r\nthree parallel columns, consisting of the _Hastati_, _Principes_, and\r\n_Triarii_: the beasts of burden belonging to the maniples in the van\r\nare placed in front of all, those belonging to the second behind the\r\nleading maniples, and those belonging to the third behind the second\r\nmaniples, thus having the baggage and the maniples in alternate lines.\r\nWith this order of march, on an alarm being given, the columns face to\r\nthe right or left according to the quarter on which the enemy appears,\r\nand get clear of the baggage. So that in a short space of time, and by\r\none movement, the whole of the hoplites are in line of battle—except\r\nthat sometimes it is necessary to half-wheel the _Hastati_ also—and the\r\nbaggage and the rest of the army are in their proper place for safety,\r\nnamely, in the rear of the line of combatants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Encampment on the march.]\r\n\r\n+41.+ When the army on the march is approaching the place of\r\nencampment, a Tribune, and those of the centurions who have been from\r\ntime to time selected for that duty, are sent forward to survey the\r\nplace of encampment. Having done this they proceed first of all to fix\r\nupon the place for the Consul’s tent (as I have described above), and\r\nto determine on which side of the Praetorium to quarter the legions.\r\nHaving decided these points they measure out the Praetorium, then they\r\ndraw the straight line along which the tents of the Tribunes are to be\r\npitched, and then the line parallel to this, beyond which the quarters\r\nof the legions are to begin. In the same way they draw the lines on\r\nthe other sides of the Praetorium in accordance with the plan which I\r\nhave already detailed at length. This does not take long, nor is the\r\nmarking out of the camp a matter of difficulty, because the dimensions\r\nare all regularly laid down, and are in accordance with precedent. Then\r\nthey fix one flag in the ground where the Consul’s tent is to stand,\r\nand another on the base of the square containing it, and a third on the\r\nline of the Tribunes’ tents; the two latter are scarlet, that which\r\nmarks the Consul’s tent is white; the lines on the other sides of the\r\nPraetorium are marked sometimes with plain spears and sometimes by\r\nflags of other colours. After this they lay out the _viae_ between the\r\nquarters, fixing spears at each _via_. Consequently when the legions\r\nin the course of their march have come near enough to get a clear view\r\nof the place of encampment, they can all make out exactly the whole\r\nplan of it, taking as their base the Consul’s flag and calculating from\r\nthat. Moreover as each soldier knows precisely on which _via_, and at\r\nwhat point of it, his quarters are to be, because all occupy the same\r\nposition in the camp wherever it may be, it is exactly like a legion\r\nentering its own city; when breaking off at the gates each man makes\r\nstraight for his own residence without hesitation, because he knows\r\nthe direction and the quarter of the town in which home lies. It is\r\nprecisely the same in a Roman camp.\r\n\r\n+42.+ It is because the first object of the Romans in the matter of\r\nencampment is facility, that they seem to me to differ diametrically\r\nfrom Greek military men in this respect. Greeks, in choosing a place\r\nfor a camp, think primarily of security from the natural strength of\r\nthe position: first, because they are averse from the toil of digging a\r\nfoss, and, secondly, because they think that no artificial defences are\r\ncomparable to those afforded by the nature of the ground. Accordingly,\r\nthey not only have to vary the whole configuration of the camp to suit\r\nthe nature of the ground, but to change the arrangement of details in\r\nall kinds of irregular ways; so that neither soldier nor company has\r\na fixed place in it. The Romans, on the other hand, prefer to undergo\r\nthe fatigue of digging, and of the other labours of circumvallation,\r\nfor the sake of the facility in arrangement, and to secure a plan of\r\nencampment which shall be one and the same and familiar to all.\r\n\r\nSuch are the most important facts in regard to the legions and the\r\nmethod of encamping them....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN REPUBLIC COMPARED WITH OTHERS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Theban constitution may be put aside,]\r\n\r\n+43.+ Nearly all historians have recorded as constitutions of eminent\r\nexcellence those of Lacedaemonia, Crete, Mantinea, and Carthage. Some\r\nhave also mentioned those of Athens and Thebes. The former I may allow\r\nto pass; but I am convinced that little need be said of the Athenian\r\nand Theban constitutions: their growth was abnormal, the period of\r\ntheir zenith brief, and the changes they experienced unusually violent.\r\nTheir glory was a sudden and fortuitous flash, so to speak; and while\r\nthey still thought themselves prosperous, and likely to remain so, they\r\nfound themselves involved in circumstances completely the reverse. The\r\nThebans got their reputation for valour among the Greeks, by taking\r\nadvantage of the senseless policy of the Lacedaemonians, and the\r\nhatred of the allies towards them, owing to the valour of one, or at\r\nmost two, men who were wise enough to appreciate the situation. Since\r\nfortune quickly made it evident that it was not the peculiarity of\r\ntheir constitution, but the valour of their leaders, which gave the\r\nThebans their success. For the great power of Thebes notoriously took\r\nits rise, attained its zenith, and fell to the ground with the lives of\r\nEpaminondas and Pelopidas. We must therefore conclude that it was not\r\nits constitution, but its men, that caused the high fortune which it\r\nthen enjoyed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: as also the Athenian.]\r\n\r\n+44.+ A somewhat similar remark applies to the Athenian constitution\r\nalso. For though it perhaps had more frequent interludes of excellence,\r\nyet its highest perfection was attained during the brilliant career\r\nof Themistocles; and having reached that point it quickly declined,\r\nowing to its essential instability. For the Athenian demus is always\r\nin the position of a ship without a commander. In such a ship, if\r\nfear of the enemy, or the occurrence of a storm induce the crew to be\r\nof one mind and to obey the helmsman, everything goes well; but if\r\nthey recover from this fear, and begin to treat their officers with\r\ncontempt, and to quarrel with each other because they are no longer\r\nall of one mind,—one party wishing to continue the voyage, and the\r\nother urging the steersman to bring the ship to anchor; some letting\r\nout the sheets, and others hauling them in, and ordering the sails to\r\nbe furled,—their discord and quarrels make a sorry show to lookers on;\r\nand the position of affairs is full of risk to those on board engaged\r\non the same voyage: and the result has often been that, after escaping\r\nthe dangers of the widest seas, and the most violent storms, they wreck\r\ntheir ship in harbour and close to shore. And this is what has often\r\nhappened to the Athenian constitution. For, after repelling, on various\r\noccasions, the greatest and most formidable dangers by the valour of\r\nits people and their leaders, there have been times when, in periods\r\nof secure tranquillity, it has gratuitously and recklessly encountered\r\ndisaster.[305] Therefore I need say no more about either it, or the\r\nTheban constitution: in both of which a mob manages everything on its\r\nown unfettered impulse—a mob in the one city distinguished for headlong\r\noutbursts of fiery temper, in the other trained in long habits of\r\nviolence and ferocity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Spartan polity unlike that of Crete.]\r\n\r\n+45.+ Passing to the Cretan polity there are two points which\r\ndeserve our consideration. The first is how such writers as Ephorus,\r\nXenophon, Callisthenes and Plato[306]—who are the most learned of the\r\nancients—could assert that it was like that of Sparta; and secondly\r\nhow they came to assert that it was at all admirable. I can agree with\r\nneither assertion; and I will explain why I say so. And first as to its\r\ndissimilarity with the Spartan constitution. The peculiar merit of the\r\nlatter is said to be its land laws, by which no one possesses more than\r\nanother, but all citizens have an equal share in the public land.[307]\r\nThe next distinctive feature regards the possession of money: for as it\r\nis utterly discredited among them, the jealous competition which arises\r\nfrom inequality of wealth is entirely removed from the city. A third\r\npeculiarity of the Lacedaemonian polity is that, of the officials by\r\nwhose hands and with whose advice the whole government is conducted,\r\nthe kings hold an hereditary office, while the members of the Gerusia\r\nare elected for life.\r\n\r\n+46.+ Among the Cretans the exact reverse of all these arrangements\r\nobtains. The laws allow them to possess as much land as they can get\r\nwith no limitation whatever. Money is so highly valued among them,\r\nthat its possession is not only thought to be necessary but in the\r\nhighest degree creditable. And in fact greed and avarice are so native\r\nto the soil in Crete, that they are the only people in the world among\r\nwhom no stigma attaches to any sort of gain whatever. Again all their\r\noffices are annual and on a democratical footing. I have therefore\r\noften felt at a loss to account for these writers speaking of the two\r\nconstitutions, which are radically different, as though they were\r\nclosely united and allied. But, besides overlooking these important\r\ndifferences, these writers have gone out of their way to comment at\r\nlength on the legislation of Lycurgus: “He was the only legislator,”\r\nthey say, “who saw the important points. For there being two things\r\non which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—courage in the face of\r\nthe enemy and concord at home,—by abolishing covetousness, he with\r\nit removed all motive for civil broil and contest: whence it has\r\nbeen brought about that the Lacedaemonians are the best governed and\r\nmost united people in Greece.” Yet while giving utterance to these\r\nsentiments, and though they see that, in contrast to this, the Cretans\r\nby their ingrained avarice are engaged in countless public and private\r\nseditions, murders and civil wars, they yet regard these facts as\r\nnot affecting their contention, but are bold enough to speak of the\r\ntwo constitutions as alike. Ephorus, indeed, putting aside names,\r\nemploys expressions so precisely the same, when discoursing on the\r\ntwo constitutions, that, unless one noticed the proper names, there\r\nwould be no means whatever of distinguishing which of the two he was\r\ndescribing.\r\n\r\n+47.+ In what the difference between them consists I have already\r\nstated. I will now address myself to showing that the Cretan\r\nconstitution deserves neither praise nor imitation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tests of a good polity.]\r\n\r\nTo my mind, then, there are two things fundamental to every state,\r\nin virtue of which its powers and constitution become desirable or\r\nobjectionable. These are customs and laws. Of these the desirable are\r\nthose which make men’s private lives holy and pure, and the public\r\ncharacter of the state civilised and just. The objectionable are those\r\nwhose effect is the reverse. As, then, when we see good customs and\r\ngood laws prevailing among certain people, we confidently assume that,\r\nin consequence of them, the men and their civil constitution will be\r\ngood also, so when we see private life full of covetousness, and public\r\npolicy of injustice, plainly we have reason for asserting their laws,\r\nparticular customs, and general constitution to be bad. Now, with few\r\nexceptions, you could find no habits prevailing in private life more\r\nsteeped in treachery than those in Crete, and no public policy more\r\ninequitable. Holding, then, the Cretan constitution to be neither like\r\nthe Spartan, nor worthy of choice or imitation, I reject it from the\r\ncomparison which I have instituted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ideal polities may be omitted.]\r\n\r\nNor again would it be fair to introduce the Republic of Plato, which\r\nis also spoken of in high terms by some Philosophers. For just as we\r\nrefuse admission to the athletic contests to those actors or athletes\r\nwho have not acquired a recognised position[308] or trained for them,\r\nso we ought not to admit this Platonic constitution to the contest\r\nfor the prize of merit unless it can first point to some genuine and\r\npractical achievement. Up to this time the notion of bringing it into\r\ncomparison with the constitutions of Sparta, Rome, and Carthage would\r\nbe like putting up a statue to compare with living and breathing men.\r\nEven if such a statue were faultless in point of art, the comparison\r\nof the lifeless with the living would naturally leave an impression of\r\nimperfection and incongruity upon the minds of the spectators.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The aims of Lycurgus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their partial failure.]\r\n\r\n+48.+ I shall therefore omit these, and proceed with my description\r\nof the Laconian constitution. Now it seems to me that for securing\r\nunity among the citizens, for safe-guarding the Laconian territory,\r\nand preserving the liberty of Sparta inviolate, the legislation\r\nand provisions of Lycurgus were so excellent, that I am forced to\r\nregard his wisdom as something superhuman. For the equality of landed\r\npossessions, the simplicity in their food, and the practice of taking\r\nit in common, which he established, were well calculated to secure\r\nmorality in private life and to prevent civil broils in the State; as\r\nalso their training in the endurance of labours and dangers to make\r\nmen brave and noble minded: but when both these virtues, courage and\r\nhigh morality, are combined in one soul or in one state, vice will\r\nnot readily spring from such a soil, nor will such men easily be\r\novercome by their enemies. By constructing his constitution therefore\r\nin this spirit, and of these elements, he secured two blessings to\r\nthe Spartans,—safety for their territory, and a lasting freedom for\r\nthemselves long after he was gone. He appears however to have made no\r\none provision whatever, particular or general, for the acquisition\r\nof the territory of their neighbours; or for the assertion of their\r\nsupremacy; or, in a word, for any policy of aggrandisement at all. What\r\nhe had still to do was to impose such a necessity, or create such a\r\nspirit among the citizens, that, as he had succeeded in making their\r\nindividual lives independent and simple, the public character of the\r\nstate should also become independent and moral. But the actual fact\r\nis, that, though he made them the most disinterested and sober-minded\r\nmen in the world, as far as their own ways of life and their national\r\ninstitutions were concerned, he left them in regard to the rest of\r\nGreece ambitious, eager for supremacy, and encroaching in the highest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First and second Messenian wars, B.C. 745-724 (?), 685-668.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Plataea, B.C. 479.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peace of Antalcidas, B.C. 387.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The causes of this failure.]\r\n\r\n+49.+ For in the first place is it not notorious that they were nearly\r\nthe first Greeks to cast a covetous eye upon the territory of their\r\nneighbours, and that accordingly they waged a war of subjugation on\r\nthe Messenians? In the next place is it not related in all histories\r\nthat in their dogged obstinacy they bound themselves with an oath\r\nnever to desist from the siege of Messene until they had taken it?\r\nAnd lastly it is known to all that in their efforts for supremacy in\r\nGreece they submitted to do the bidding of those whom they had once\r\nconquered in war. For when the Persians invaded Greece, they conquered\r\nthem, as champions of the liberty of the Greeks; yet when the invaders\r\nhad retired and fled, they betrayed the cities of Greece into their\r\nhands by the peace of Antalcidas, for the sake of getting money to\r\nsecure their supremacy over the Greeks. It was then that the defect\r\nin their constitution was rendered apparent. For as long as their\r\nambition was confined to governing their immediate neighbours, or even\r\nthe Peloponnesians only, they were content with the resources and\r\nsupplies provided by Laconia itself, having all material of war ready\r\nto hand, and being able without much expenditure of time to return\r\nhome or convey provisions with them. But directly they took in hand to\r\ndespatch naval expeditions, or to go on campaigns by land outside the\r\nPeloponnese, it was evident that neither their iron currency, nor their\r\nuse of crops for payment in kind, would be able to supply them with\r\nwhat they lacked if they abided by the legislation of Lycurgus; for\r\nsuch undertakings required money universally current, and goods from\r\nforeign countries. Thus they were compelled to wait humbly at Persian\r\ndoors, impose tribute on the islanders, and exact contributions from\r\nall the Greeks: knowing that, if they abided by the laws of Lycurgus,\r\nit was impossible to advance any claims upon any outside power at all,\r\nmuch less upon the supremacy in Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sparta fails where Rome succeeds.]\r\n\r\n+50.+ My object, then, in this digression is to make it manifest by\r\nactual facts that, for guarding their own country with absolute safety,\r\nand for preserving their own freedom, the legislation of Lycurgus was\r\nentirely sufficient; and for those who are content with these objects\r\nwe must concede that there neither exists, nor ever has existed, a\r\nconstitution and civil order preferable to that of Sparta. But if any\r\none is seeking aggrandisement, and believes that to be a leader and\r\nruler and despot of numerous subjects, and to have all looking and\r\nturning to him, is a finer thing than that,—in this point of view we\r\nmust acknowledge that the Spartan constitution is deficient, and that\r\nof Rome superior and better constituted for obtaining power. And this\r\nhas been proved by actual facts. For when the Lacedaemonians strove\r\nto possess themselves of the supremacy in Greece, it was not long\r\nbefore they brought their own freedom itself into danger. Whereas the\r\nRomans, after obtaining supreme power over the Italians themselves,\r\nsoon brought the whole world under their rule,—in which achievement the\r\nabundance and availability of their supplies largely contributed to\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rome fresher than Carthage;]\r\n\r\n+51.+ Now the Carthaginian constitution seems to me originally to\r\nhave been well contrived in these most distinctively important\r\nparticulars. For they had kings,[309] and the Gerusia had the powers\r\nof an aristocracy, and the multitude were supreme in such things as\r\naffected them; and on the whole the adjustment of its several parts\r\nwas very like that of Rome and Sparta. But about the period of its\r\nentering on the Hannibalian war the political state of Carthage was\r\non the decline,[310] that of Rome improving. For whereas there is in\r\nevery body, or polity, or business a natural stage of growth, zenith,\r\nand decay; and whereas everything in them is at its best at the zenith;\r\nwe may thereby judge of the difference between these two constitutions\r\nas they existed at that period. For exactly so far as the strength and\r\nprosperity of Carthage preceded that of Rome in point of time, by so\r\nmuch was Carthage then past its prime, while Rome was exactly at its\r\nzenith, as far as its political constitution was concerned. In Carthage\r\ntherefore the influence of the people in the policy of the state had\r\nalready risen to be supreme, while at Rome the Senate was at the height\r\nof its power: and so, as in the one measures were deliberated upon by\r\nthe many, in the other by the best men, the policy of the Romans in all\r\npublic undertakings proved the stronger; on which account, though they\r\nmet with capital disasters, by force of prudent counsels they finally\r\nconquered the Carthaginians in the war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and its citizen levies superior to Carthaginian mercenaries.]\r\n\r\n+52.+ If we look however at separate details, for instance at the\r\nprovisions for carrying on a war, we shall find that whereas for\r\na naval expedition the Carthaginians are the better trained and\r\nprepared,—as it is only natural with a people with whom it has been\r\nhereditary for many generations to practise this craft, and to follow\r\nthe seaman’s trade above all nations in the world,—yet, in regard to\r\nmilitary service on land, the Romans train themselves to a much higher\r\npitch than the Carthaginians. The former bestow their whole attention\r\nupon this department: whereas the Carthaginians wholly neglect their\r\ninfantry, though they do take some slight interest in the cavalry. The\r\nreason of this is that they employ foreign mercenaries, the Romans\r\nnative and citizen levies. It is in this point that the latter polity\r\nis preferable to the former. They have their hopes of freedom ever\r\nresting on the courage of mercenary troops: the Romans on the valour\r\nof their own citizens and the aid of their allies. The result is that\r\neven if the Romans have suffered a defeat at first, they renew the\r\nwar with undiminished forces, which the Carthaginians cannot do. For,\r\nas the Romans are fighting for country and children, it is impossible\r\nfor them to relax the fury of their struggle; but they persist with\r\nobstinate resolution until they have overcome their enemies. What has\r\nhappened in regard to their navy is an instance in point. In skill the\r\nRomans are much behind the Carthaginians, as I have already said; yet\r\nthe upshot of the whole naval war has been a decided triumph for the\r\nRomans, owing to the valour of their men. For although nautical science\r\ncontributes largely to success in sea-fights, still it is the courage\r\nof the marines that turns the scale most decisively in favour of\r\nvictory. The fact is that Italians as a nation are by nature superior\r\nto Phoenicians and Libyans both in physical strength and courage; but\r\nstill their habits also do much to inspire the youth with enthusiasm\r\nfor such exploits. One example will be sufficient of the pains taken\r\nby the Roman state to turn out men ready to endure anything to win a\r\nreputation in their country for valour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laudations at funerals.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Imagines.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Toga praetexta, purpurea, picta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sellae curules.]\r\n\r\n+53.+ Whenever one of their illustrious men dies, in the course of his\r\nfuneral, the body with all its paraphernalia is carried into the forum\r\nto the Rostra, as a raised platform there is called, and sometimes\r\nis propped upright upon it so as to be conspicuous, or, more rarely,\r\nis laid upon it. Then with all the people standing round, his son,\r\nif he has left one of full age and he is there, or, failing him, one\r\nof his relations, mounts the Rostra and delivers a speech concerning\r\nthe virtues of the deceased, and the successful exploits performed\r\nby him in his lifetime. By these means the people are reminded of\r\nwhat has been done, and made to see it with their own eyes,—not\r\nonly such as were engaged in the actual transactions but those also\r\nwho were not;—and their sympathies are so deeply moved, that the\r\nloss appears not to be confined to the actual mourners, but to be a\r\npublic one affecting the whole people. After the burial and all the\r\nusual ceremonies have been performed, they place the likeness of the\r\ndeceased in the most conspicuous spot in his house, surmounted by a\r\nwooden canopy or shrine. This likeness consists of a mask made to\r\nrepresent the deceased with extraordinary fidelity both in shape and\r\ncolour. These likenesses they display at public sacrifices adorned\r\nwith much care. And when any illustrious member of the family dies,\r\nthey carry these masks to the funeral, putting them on men whom they\r\nthought as like the originals as possible in height and other personal\r\npeculiarities. And these substitutes assume clothes according to the\r\nrank of the person represented: if he was a consul or praetor, a toga\r\nwith purple stripes; if a censor, whole purple;[311] if he had also\r\ncelebrated a triumph or performed any exploit of that kind, a toga\r\nembroidered with gold. These representatives also ride themselves\r\nin chariots, while the fasces and axes, and all the other customary\r\ninsignia of the particular offices, lead the way, according to the\r\ndignity of the rank in the state enjoyed by the deceased in his\r\nlifetime; and on arriving at the Rostra they all take their seats on\r\nivory chairs in their order.\r\n\r\nThere could not easily be a more inspiring spectacle than this for\r\na young man of noble ambitions and virtuous aspirations. For can we\r\nconceive any one to be unmoved at the sight of all the likenesses\r\ncollected together of the men who have earned glory, all as it were\r\nliving and breathing? Or what could be a more glorious spectacle?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Devotion of the citizens.]\r\n\r\n+54.+ Besides the speaker over the body about to be buried, after\r\nhaving finished the panegyric of this particular person, starts upon\r\nthe others whose representatives are present, beginning with the most\r\nancient, and recounts the successes and achievements of each. By this\r\nmeans the glorious memory of brave men is continually renewed; the fame\r\nof those who have performed any noble deed is never allowed to die;\r\nand the renown of those who have done good service to their country\r\nbecomes a matter of common knowledge to the multitude, and part of the\r\nheritage of posterity. But the chief benefit of the ceremony is that it\r\ninspires young men to shrink from no exertion for the general welfare,\r\nin the hope of obtaining the glory which awaits the brave. And what I\r\nsay is confirmed by this fact. Many Romans have volunteered to decide\r\na whole battle by single combat; not a few have deliberately accepted\r\ncertain death, some in time of war to secure the safety of the rest,\r\nsome in time of peace to preserve the safety of the commonwealth. There\r\nhave also been instances of men in office putting their own sons to\r\ndeath, in defiance of every custom and law, because they rated the\r\ninterests of their country higher than those of natural ties even with\r\ntheir nearest and dearest. There are many stories of this kind, related\r\nof many men in Roman history; but one will be enough for our present\r\npurpose; and I will give the name as an instance to prove the truth of\r\nmy words.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Horatius Cocles.]\r\n\r\n+55.+ The story goes that Horatius Cocles, while fighting with two\r\nenemies at the head of the bridge over the Tiber, which is the entrance\r\nto the city on the north, seeing a large body of men advancing to\r\nsupport his enemies, and fearing that they would force their way into\r\nthe city, turned round, and shouted to those behind him to hasten\r\nback to the other side and break down the bridge. They obeyed him:\r\nand whilst they were breaking the bridge, he remained at his post\r\nreceiving numerous wounds, and checked the progress of the enemy: his\r\nopponents being panic stricken, not so much by his strength as by\r\nthe audacity with which he held his ground. When the bridge had been\r\nbroken down, the attack of the enemy was stopped; and Cocles then threw\r\nhimself into the river with his armour on and deliberately sacrificed\r\nhis life, because he valued the safety of his country and his own\r\nfuture reputation more highly than his present life, and the years\r\nof existence that remained to him.[312] Such is the enthusiasm and\r\nemulation for noble deeds that are engendered among the Romans by their\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purity of election.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cf. ch. 14.]\r\n\r\n+56.+ Again the Roman customs and principles regarding money\r\ntransactions are better than those of the Carthaginians. In the view\r\nof the latter nothing is disgraceful that makes for gain; with the\r\nformer nothing is more disgraceful than to receive bribes and to make\r\nprofit by improper means. For they regard wealth obtained from unlawful\r\ntransactions to be as much a subject of reproach, as a fair profit from\r\nthe most unquestioned source is of commendation. A proof of the fact is\r\nthis. The Carthaginians obtain office by open bribery, but among the\r\nRomans the penalty for it is death. With such a radical difference,\r\ntherefore, between the rewards offered to virtue among the two peoples,\r\nit is natural that the ways adopted for obtaining them should be\r\ndifferent also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regard to religion.]\r\n\r\nBut the most important difference for the better which the Roman\r\ncommonwealth appears to me to display is in their religious beliefs.\r\nFor I conceive that what in other nations is looked upon as a reproach,\r\nI mean a scrupulous fear of the gods, is the very thing which keeps\r\nthe Roman commonwealth together. To such an extraordinary height is\r\nthis carried among them, both in private and public business, that\r\nnothing could exceed it. Many people might think this unaccountable;\r\nbut in my opinion their object is to use it as a check upon the common\r\npeople. If it were possible to form a state wholly of philosophers,\r\nsuch a custom would perhaps be unnecessary. But seeing that every\r\nmultitude is fickle, and full of lawless desires, unreasoning anger,\r\nand violent passion, the only resource is to keep them in check by\r\nmysterious terrors and scenic effects of this sort. Wherefore, to my\r\nmind, the ancients were not acting without purpose or at random, when\r\nthey brought in among the vulgar those opinions about the gods, and the\r\nbelief in the punishments in Hades: much rather do I think that men\r\nnowadays are acting rashly and foolishly in rejecting them. This is the\r\nreason why, apart from anything else, Greek statesmen, if entrusted\r\nwith a single talent, though protected by ten checking-clerks, as many\r\nseals, and twice as many witnesses, yet cannot be induced to keep\r\nfaith: whereas among the Romans, in their magistracies and embassies,\r\nmen have the handling of a great amount of money, and yet from pure\r\nrespect to their oath keep their faith intact. And, again, in other\r\nnations it is a rare thing to find a man who keeps his hands out of\r\nthe public purse, and is entirely pure in such matters: but among the\r\nRomans it is a rare thing to detect a man in the act of committing such\r\na crime.[313]...\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n+57.+ That to all things, then, which exist there is ordained decay\r\nand change I think requires no further arguments to show: for the\r\ninexorable course of nature is sufficient to convince us of it.\r\n\r\nBut in all polities we observe two sources of decay existing from\r\nnatural causes, the one external, the other internal and self-produced.\r\nThe external admits of no certain or fixed definition, but the internal\r\nfollows a definite order. What kind of polity, then, comes naturally\r\nfirst, and what second, I have already stated in such a way, that\r\nthose who are capable of taking in the whole drift of my argument can\r\nhenceforth draw their own conclusions as to the future of the Roman\r\npolity. For it is quite clear, in my opinion. When a commonwealth,\r\nafter warding off many great dangers, has arrived at a high pitch of\r\nprosperity and undisputed power, it is evident that, by the lengthened\r\ncontinuance of great wealth within it, the manner of life of its\r\ncitizens will become more extravagant; and that the rivalry for\r\noffice, and in other spheres of activity, will become fiercer than it\r\nought to be. And as this state of things goes on more and more, the\r\ndesire of office and the shame of losing reputation, as well as the\r\nostentation and extravagance of living, will prove the beginning of\r\na deterioration. And of this change the people will be credited with\r\nbeing the authors, when they become convinced that they are being\r\ncheated by some from avarice, and are puffed up with flattery by others\r\nfrom love of office. For when that comes about, in their passionate\r\nresentment and acting under the dictates of anger, they will refuse to\r\nobey any longer, or to be content with having equal powers with their\r\nleaders, but will demand to have all or far the greatest themselves.\r\nAnd when that comes to pass the constitution will receive a new name,\r\nwhich sounds better than any other in the world, liberty or democracy;\r\nbut, in fact, it will become that worst of all governments, mob-rule.\r\n\r\nWith this description of the formation, growth, zenith, and present\r\nstate of the Roman polity, and having discussed also its difference,\r\nfor better and worse, from other polities, I will now at length bring\r\nmy essay on it to an end.\r\n\r\n+58.+ Resuming my history from the point at which I started on this\r\ndigression I will briefly refer to one transaction, that I may give\r\na practical illustration of the perfection and power of the Roman\r\npolity at that period, as though I were producing one of his works as a\r\nspecimen of the skill of a good artist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216. Hannibal offers to put the prisoners at Cannae to\r\nransom.]\r\n\r\nWhen Hannibal, after conquering the Romans in the battle at Cannae,\r\ngot possession of the eight thousand who were guarding the Roman camp,\r\nhe made them all prisoners of war, and granted them permission to send\r\nmessages to their relations that they might be ransomed and return\r\nhome. They accordingly selected ten of their chief men, whom Hannibal\r\nallowed to depart after binding them with an oath to return. But one\r\nof them, just as he had got outside the palisade of the camp, saying\r\nthat he had forgotten something, went back; and, having got what he\r\nhad left behind, once more set out, under the belief that by means of\r\nthis return he had kept his promise and discharged his oath. Upon the\r\narrival of the envoys at Rome, imploring and beseeching the Senate not\r\nto grudge the captured troops their return home, but to allow them to\r\nrejoin their friends by paying three minae each for them,—for these\r\nwere the terms, they said, granted by Hannibal,—and declaring that\r\nthe men deserved redemption, for they had neither played the coward\r\nin the field, nor done anything unworthy of Rome, but had been left\r\nbehind to guard the camp; and that, when all the rest had perished,\r\nthey had yielded to absolute necessity in surrendering to Hannibal:\r\nthough the Romans had been severely defeated in the battles, and\r\nthough they were at the time deprived of, roughly speaking, all their\r\nallies, they neither yielded so far to misfortune as to disregard\r\nwhat was becoming to themselves, nor omitted to take into account any\r\nnecessary consideration. They saw through Hannibal’s purpose in thus\r\nacting,—which was at once to get a large supply of money, and at the\r\nsame time to take away all enthusiasm from the troops opposed to him,\r\nby showing that even the conquered had a hope of getting safe home\r\nagain. Therefore the Senate, far from acceding to the request, refused\r\nall pity even to their own relations, and disregarded the services\r\nto be expected from these men in the future: and thus frustrated\r\nHannibal’s calculations, and the hopes which he had founded on these\r\nprisoners, by refusing to ransom them; and at the same time established\r\nthe rule for their own men, that they must either conquer or die on\r\nthe field, as there was no other hope of safety for them if they were\r\nbeaten. With this answer they dismissed the nine envoys who returned\r\nof their own accord; but the tenth who had put the cunning trick in\r\npractice for discharging himself of his oath they put in chains and\r\ndelivered to the enemy. So that Hannibal was not so much rejoiced at\r\nhis victory in the battle, as struck with astonishment at the unshaken\r\nfirmness and lofty spirit displayed in the resolutions of these\r\nsenators.[314]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\nCAPUA AND PETELIA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Capua and Petelia, the contrast of their fortunes.]\r\n\r\n+1.+ The people of Capua, in Campania, becoming wealthy through the\r\nfertility of their soil, degenerated into luxury and extravagance\r\nsurpassing even the common report about Croton and Sybaris. Being then\r\nunable to support their burden of prosperity they called in Hannibal;\r\nand were accordingly treated with great severity by Rome. But the\r\npeople of Petelia maintained their loyalty to Rome and held out so\r\nobstinately, when besieged by Hannibal, that after having eaten all the\r\nleather in the town, and the bark of all the trees in it, and having\r\nstood the siege for eleven months, as no one came to their relief, they\r\nsurrendered with the entire approval of the Romans.... But Capua by its\r\ninfluence drew over the other cities to the Carthaginians....\r\n\r\n\r\nHIERONYMUS OF SYRACUSE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hieronymus succeeded his grandfather Hiero II. in B.C. 216.\r\nUnder the influence of his uncles, Zoippus and Andranodorus, members of\r\nthe Council of 15 established by Hiero, Hieronymus opens communications\r\nwith Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Commissioners sent to Carthage to formulate a treaty of\r\nalliance.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ After the plot against Hieronymus, King of Syracuse, Thraso having\r\ndeparted, Zoippus and Andranodorus persuaded Hieronymus to lose no time\r\nin sending ambassadors to Hannibal. He accordingly selected Polycleitus\r\nof Cyrene and Philodemus of Argos for the purpose, and sent them\r\ninto Italy, with a commission to discuss the subject of an alliance\r\nwith the Carthaginians; and at the same time he sent his brothers to\r\nAlexandria. Hannibal received Polycleitus and Philodemus with warmth;\r\nheld out great prospects to the young king; and sent the ambassadors\r\nback without delay, accompanied by the commander of his triremes, a\r\nCarthaginian also named Hannibal, and the Syracusan Hippocrates and\r\nhis younger brother Epicydes. These men had been for some time serving\r\nin Hannibal’s army, being domiciled at Carthage, owing to their\r\ngrandfather having been banished from Syracuse because he was believed\r\nto have assassinated Agatharchus, one of the sons of Agathocles. On\r\nthe arrival of these commissioners at Syracuse, Polycleitus and his\r\ncolleague reported the result of their embassy, and the Carthaginian\r\ndelivered the message given by Hannibal: whereupon the king without\r\nhesitation expressed his willingness to make a treaty with the\r\nCarthaginians; and, begging the Hannibal who had come to him to go with\r\nall speed to Carthage, promised that he also would send commissioners\r\nfrom his own court, to settle matters with the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Roman praetor sends to remonstrate. A scene with the\r\nking.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ Meanwhile intelligence of this transaction had reached the Roman\r\npraetor at Lilybaeum, who immediately despatched legates to Hieronymus,\r\nto renew the treaty which had been made with his ancestors. Being\r\nthoroughly annoyed with this embassy, Hieronymus said that “He was\r\nsorry for the Romans that they had come to such utter and shameful\r\ngrief[315] in the battles in Italy at the hands of the Carthaginians.”\r\nThe legates were overpowered by the rudeness of the answer: still they\r\nproceeded to ask him, “Who said such things about them?” Whereupon\r\nthe king pointed to the Carthaginian envoys who were there, and said,\r\n“You had better convict them, if they have really been telling me\r\nlies?” The Roman legates answered that it was not their habit to take\r\nthe word of enemies: and advised him to do nothing in violation of\r\nthe existing treaty; for that would be at once equitable and the best\r\nthing for himself. To this the king answered that he would take time\r\nto consider of it, and tell them his decision another time; but he\r\nproceeded to ask them, “How it came about that before his grandfather’s\r\ndeath a squadron of fifty Roman ships had sailed as far as Pachynus and\r\nthen gone back again.” The fact was that a short time ago the Romans\r\nhad heard that Hiero was dead; and being much alarmed lest people in\r\nSyracuse, despising the youth of the grandson whom he left, should stir\r\nup a revolution, they had made this cruise with the intention of being\r\nready there to assist his youthful weakness, and to help in maintaining\r\nhis authority; but being informed that his grandfather was still alive,\r\nthey sailed back again. When the ambassadors had stated these facts,\r\nthe young king answered again, “Then please to allow me too now, O\r\nRomans, to maintain my authority by ’sailing back’ to see what I can\r\nget from Carthage.” The Roman legates perceiving the warmth with which\r\nthe king was engaging in his policy, said nothing at the time; but\r\nreturned and informed the praetor who had sent them of what had been\r\nsaid. From that time forward, therefore, the Romans kept a careful\r\nwatch upon him as an enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The treaty with Carthage.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The king’s pretensions rise, and a new arrangement is made\r\nwith Carthage.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ Hieronymus on his part selected Agatharchus, Onesimus, and\r\nHipposthenes to send with Hannibal to Carthage, with instructions to\r\nmake an alliance on the following terms: “The Carthaginians to assist\r\nhim with land and sea forces, in expelling the Romans from Sicily, and\r\nthen divide the island with him; so as to have the river Himera, which\r\ndivides Sicily almost exactly in half, as the boundary between the\r\ntwo provinces.” The commissioners arrived in Carthage: and finding,\r\non coming to a conference, that the Carthaginians were prepared to\r\nmeet them in every point, they completed the arrangement. Meanwhile\r\nHippocrates got the young Hieronymus entirely into his hands: and at\r\nfirst fired his imagination by telling him of Hannibal’s marches and\r\npitched battles in Italy; and afterwards by repeating to him that no\r\none had a better right to the government of all Siceliots than he; in\r\nthe first place as the son of Nereis daughter of Pyrrhus, the only\r\nman whom all Siceliots alike had accepted deliberately and with full\r\nassent as their leader and king; and in the second place in virtue of\r\nhis grandfather Hiero’s sovereign rights. At last he and his brother\r\nso won upon the young man by their conversation, that he would attend\r\nto no one else at all: partly from the natural feebleness of his\r\ncharacter, but still more from the ambitious feelings which they had\r\nexcited in him. And therefore, just when Agatharchus and his colleagues\r\nwere completing the business on which they had been sent in Carthage,\r\nhe sent fresh ambassadors, saying that all Sicily belonged to him; and\r\ndemanding that the Carthaginians should help him to recover Sicily:\r\nwhile he promised he would assist the Carthaginians in their Italian\r\ncampaign. Though the Carthaginians now saw perfectly well the whole\r\nextent of the young man’s fickleness and infatuation: yet thinking it\r\nto be in manifold ways to their interests not to let Sicilian affairs\r\nout of their hands, they assented to his demands; and having already\r\nprepared ships and men, they set about arranging for the transport of\r\ntheir forces into Sicily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Romans again remonstrate. Another scene at the Council.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War with Rome decided upon.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ When they heard of this, the Romans sent legates to him again,\r\nprotesting against his violation of the treaty made with his\r\nforefathers. Hieronymus thereupon summoned a meeting of his council\r\nconsulted them as to what he was to do. The native members of it kept\r\nsilent, because they feared the folly of their ruler. Aristomachus\r\nof Corinth, Damippus of Sparta, Autonous of Thessaly advised that\r\nhe should abide by the treaty with Rome. Andranodorus alone urged\r\nthat he should not let the opportunity slip; and affirmed that the\r\npresent was the only chance of establishing his rule over Sicily.\r\nAfter the delivery of this speech, the king asked Hippocrates and\r\nhis brother what they thought, and upon their answering, “The same\r\nas Andranodorus,” the deliberation was concluded in that sense.\r\nThus, then, war with Rome had been decided upon: but while the king\r\nwas anxious to be thought to have given an adroit answer to the\r\nambassadors, he committed himself to such an utter absurdity as to make\r\nit certain that he would not only fail to conciliate the Romans, but\r\nwould inevitably offend them violently. For he said that he would abide\r\nby the treaty, firstly, if the Romans would repay all the gold they had\r\nreceived from his grandfather Hiero; and secondly, if they would return\r\nthe corn and other presents which they had received from him from the\r\nfirst day of their intercourse with him; and thirdly, if they would\r\nacknowledge all Sicily east of the Himera to be Syracusan territory.\r\nAt these propositions of course the ambassadors and council separated;\r\nand from that time forth Hieronymus began pushing on his preparations\r\nfor war with energy: collected and armed his forces, and got ready the\r\nother necessary provisions....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Description of Leontini, where Hieronymus was murdered. See\r\nLivy, 24, 7.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ The city of Leontini taken as a whole faces north, and is divided\r\nin half by a valley of level ground, in which are the state buildings,\r\nthe court-houses, and market-place. Along each side of this valley run\r\nhills with steep banks all the way; the flat tops of which, reached\r\nafter crossing their brows, are covered with houses and temples. The\r\ncity has two gates, one on the southern extremity of this valley\r\nleading to Syracuse, the other at the northern leading on to the\r\n“Leontine plains,” and the arable district. Close under the westernmost\r\nof the steep cliffs runs a river called Lissus; parallel to which are\r\nbuilt continuous rows of houses, in great numbers, close under the\r\ncliff, between which and the river runs the road I have mentioned....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Hieronymus, B.C. 214.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ Some of the historians who have described the fall of Hieronymus\r\nhave written at great length and in terms of mysterious solemnity.\r\nThey tell us of prodigies preceding his coming to the throne, and of\r\nthe misfortunes of Syracuse. They describe in dramatic language the\r\ncruelty of his character and the impiety of his actions; and crown all\r\nwith the sudden and terrible nature of the circumstances attending his\r\nfall. One would think from their description that neither Phalaris,\r\nnor Apollodorus, nor any other tyrant was ever fiercer than he. Yet\r\nhe was a mere boy when he succeeded to power, and only lived thirteen\r\nmonths after. In this space of time it is possible that one or two men\r\nmay have been put to the rack, or certain of his friends, or other\r\nSyracusan citizens, put to death; but it is improbable that his tyranny\r\ncould have been extravagantly wicked, or his impiety outrageous. It\r\nmust be confessed that he was reckless and unscrupulous in disposition;\r\nstill we cannot compare him with either of the tyrants I have named.\r\nThe fact is that those who write the histories of particular episodes,\r\nhaving undertaken limited and narrow themes, appear to me to be\r\ncompelled from poverty of matter to exaggerate insignificant incidents,\r\nand to speak at inordinate length on subjects that scarcely deserve\r\nto be recorded at all. There are some, too, who fall into a similar\r\nmistake from mere want of judgment. With how much more reason might the\r\nspace employed on these descriptions,—which they use merely to fill up\r\nand spin out their books,—have been devoted to Hiero and Gelo, without\r\nmentioning Hieronymus at all! It would have given greater pleasure to\r\nreaders and more instruction to students.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of Hiero II., King of Syracuse, from B.C. 269 to\r\nB.C. 215.]\r\n\r\n+8.+ For, in the first place, Hiero gained the sovereignty of Syracuse\r\nand her allies by his own unaided abilities without inheriting wealth,\r\nor reputation, or any other advantage of fortune. And, in the second\r\nplace, was established king of Syracuse without putting to death,\r\nbanishing, or harassing any one of the citizens,—which is the most\r\nastonishing circumstance of all. And what is quite as surprising as\r\nthe innocence of his acquisition of power is the fact that it did\r\nnot change his character. For during a reign of fifty-four years he\r\npreserved peace for the country, maintained his own power free from\r\nall hostile plots, and entirely escaped the envy which generally\r\nfollows greatness; for though he tried on several occasions to lay\r\ndown his power, he was prevented by the common remonstrances of the\r\ncitizens. And having shown himself most beneficent to the Greeks, and\r\nmost anxious to earn their good opinion, he left behind him not merely\r\na great personal reputation but also a universal feeling of goodwill\r\ntowards the Syracusans. Again, though he passed his life in the midst\r\nof the greatest wealth, luxury, and abundance, he survived for more\r\nthan ninety years, in full possession of his senses and with all parts\r\nof his body unimpaired; which, to my mind, is a decisive proof of a\r\nwell-spent life....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gelo, son of Hiero II., associated with his father in the\r\nkingdom, B.C. 216. See 5, 88, Livy, 23, 30.]\r\n\r\nGelo, his son, in a life of more than fifty years regarded it as the\r\nmost honourable object of ambition to obey his father, and to regard\r\nneither wealth, nor sovereign power, nor anything else as of higher\r\nvalue than love and loyalty to his parents....\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY BETWEEN HANNIBAL AND KING PHILIP V. OF MACEDON\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gods by whom the oath is taken on either side.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preamble of a treaty made between Philip and Hannibal, by\r\nenvoys sent after the battle of Cannae. Ratified subsequently to March\r\n13, B.C. 215. See Livy, 23, 33-39. _Ante_ 3, 2.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ This is a sworn treaty made between Hannibal, Mago, Barmocarus,\r\nand such members of the Carthaginian Gerusia as were present, and all\r\nCarthaginians serving in his army, on the one part; and Xenophanes, son\r\nof Cleomachus of Athens, sent to us by King Philip, as his ambassador,\r\non behalf of himself, the Macedonians, and their allies, on the other\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe oath is taken in the presence of Zeus, Hera, and Apollo: of the god\r\nof the Carthaginians, Hercules, and Iolaus: of Ares, Triton, Poseidon:\r\nof the gods that accompany the army, and of the sun, moon, and earth:\r\nof rivers, harbours, waters: of all the gods who rule Carthage: of all\r\nthe gods who rule Macedonia and the rest of Greece: of all the gods of\r\nwar that are witnesses to this oath.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Declaration on the part of Hannibal of the objects of the\r\ntreaty.]\r\n\r\nHannibal, general, and all the Carthaginian senators with him, and\r\nall Carthaginians serving in his army, subject to our mutual consent,\r\nproposes to make this sworn treaty of friendship and honourable\r\ngoodwill. Let us be friends, close allies, and brethren, on the\r\nconditions herein following:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1st article sworn to by Philip’s representative.]\r\n\r\n(1) Let the Carthaginians, as supreme, Hannibal their chief general\r\nand those serving with him, all members of the Carthaginian dominion\r\nliving under the same laws, as well as the people of Utica, and the\r\ncities and tribes subject to Carthage, and their soldiers and allies,\r\nand all cities and tribes in Italy, Celt-land, and Liguria, with whom\r\nwe have a compact of friendship, and with whomsoever in this country we\r\nmay hereafter form such compact, be supported by King Philip and the\r\nMacedonians, and all other Greeks in alliance with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1st article sworn to by Hannibal and the Carthaginians.]\r\n\r\n(2) On their parts also King Philip and the Macedonians, and such\r\nother Greeks as are his allies, shall be supported and protected by\r\nthe Carthaginians now in this army, and by the people of Utica, and by\r\nall cities and tribes subject to Carthage, both soldiers and allies,\r\nand by all allied cities and tribes in Italy, Celt-land, and Liguria,\r\nand by all others in Italy as shall hereafter become allies of the\r\nCarthaginians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2d article sworn to by Phillip’s representative.]\r\n\r\n(3) We will not make plots against, nor lie in ambush for, each\r\nother; but in all sincerity and goodwill, without reserve or secret\r\ndesign, will be enemies to the enemies of the Carthaginians, saving\r\nand excepting those kings, cities, and ports with which we have sworn\r\nagreements and friendships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2d article sworn to by Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n(4) And we, too, will be enemies to the enemies of King Philip, saving\r\nand excepting those kings, cities, and tribes, with which we have sworn\r\nagreements and friendships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3d article sworn to by Philip’s representative.]\r\n\r\n(5) Ye shall be friends to us in the war in which we now are engaged\r\nagainst the Romans, till such time as the gods give us and you the\r\nvictory: and ye shall assist us in all ways that be needful, and in\r\nwhatsoever way we may mutually determine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3d article sworn to by Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n(6) And when the gods have given us victory in our war with the Romans\r\nand their allies, if Hannibal shall deem it right to make terms with\r\nthe Romans, these terms shall include the same friendship with you,\r\nmade on these conditions: (1) the Romans not to be allowed to make\r\nwar on you; (2) not to have power over Corcyra, Apollonia, Epidamnum,\r\nPharos, Dimale, Parthini, nor Atitania; (3) to restore to Demetrius of\r\nPharos all those of his friends now in the dominion of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1st joint article.]\r\n\r\n(7) If the Romans ever make war on you or on us we will aid each other\r\nin such war, according to the need of either.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2d joint article.]\r\n\r\n(8) So also if any other nation whatever does so, always excepting\r\nkings, cities, and tribes, with whom we have sworn agreements and\r\nfriendships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3d joint article. Mutual consent required for an alteration.]\r\n\r\n(9) If we decide to take away from, or add to this sworn treaty,\r\n\r\nwe will so take away, or add thereto, only as we both may agree....\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSENE AND PHILIP V. IN B.C. 215\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Political state of Messene.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ Democracy being established at Messene, and the men of rank\r\nhaving been banished, while those who had received allotments on their\r\nlands obtained the chief influence in the government, those of the old\r\ncitizens who remained found it very hard to put up with the equality\r\nwhich these men had obtained....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of the Messenian athlete and statesman Gorgus.\r\nSee _ante_, 5, 5.]\r\n\r\nGorgus of Messene, in wealth and extraction, was inferior to no one in\r\nthe town; and had been a famous athlete in his time, far surpassing all\r\nrivals in that pursuit. In fact he was not behind any man of his day\r\nin physical beauty, or the general dignity of his manner of life, or\r\nthe number of prizes he had won. Again, when he gave up athletics and\r\ndevoted himself to politics and the service of his country, he gained\r\nno less reputation in this department than in his former pursuit.\r\nFor he was removed from the Philistinism that usually characterises\r\nathletes, and was looked upon as in the highest degree an able and\r\nclear-headed politician....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip V. of Macedon at Messene, B.C. 215. See Plutarch,\r\n_Arat._ 49-50.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ Philip, king of the Macedonians, being desirous of seizing the\r\nacropolis of Messene, told the leaders of the city that he wished to\r\nsee it and to sacrifice to Zeus, and accordingly walked up thither with\r\nhis attendants and joined in the sacrifice. When, according to custom,\r\nthe entrails of the slaughtered victims were brought to him, he took\r\nthem in his hands, and, turning round a little to one side, held them\r\nout to Aratus and asked him “what he thought the sacrifices indicated?\r\nTo quit the citadel or hold it?” Thereupon Demetrius struck in on the\r\nspur of the moment by saying, “If you have the heart of an augur,—to\r\nquit it as quick as you can: but if of a gallant and wise king, to keep\r\nit, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity\r\nagain: for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep\r\nthe ox under your control.” By the “two horns” he meant Ithome and\r\nthe Acrocorinthus, and by the “ox” the Peloponnese. Thereupon Philip\r\nturned to Aratus and said, “And do you give the same advice?” Aratus\r\nnot making any answer at once, he urged him to speak his real opinion.\r\nAfter some hesitation he said, “If you can get possession of this place\r\nwithout treachery to the Messenians, I advise you to do so; but if, by\r\nthe act of occupying this citadel with a guard, you shall ruin all the\r\ncitadels, and the guard wherewith the allies were protected when they\r\ncame into your hands from Antigonus” (meaning by that, _confidence_),\r\n“consider whether it is not better to take your men away and leave\r\nthe confidence there, and with it guard the Messenians, and the other\r\nallies as well.” As far as his own inclination was concerned, Philip\r\nwas ready enough to commit an act of treachery, as his own subsequent\r\nconduct proved: but having been sharply rebuked a little while before\r\nby the younger Aratus for his destruction of human life; and seeing\r\nthat, on the present occasion, the elder spoke with boldness and\r\nauthority, and begged him not to neglect his advice, he gave in from\r\nsheer shame, and taking the latter by his right hand, said, “Then let\r\nus go back the same way we came.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Deterioration in the character of Philip V. See 4, 77.]\r\n\r\n+12.+ I wish here to stop in my narrative in order to speak briefly of\r\nthe character of Philip, because this was the beginning of the change\r\nand deterioration in it. For I think that no more telling example can\r\nbe proposed to practical statesmen who wish to correct their ideas by\r\na study of history. For the splendour of his early career, and the\r\nbrilliancy of his genius, have caused the dispositions for good and\r\nevil displayed by this king to be more conspicuous and widely known\r\nthroughout Greece than is the case with any other man; as well as the\r\ncontrast between the results accompanying the display of those opposite\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nNow that, upon his accession to the throne, Thessaly, Macedonia, and in\r\nfact all parts of his own kingdom were more thoroughly loyal and well\r\ndisposed to him, young as he was on his succeeding to the government\r\nof Macedonia, than they had ever been to any of his predecessors, may\r\nbe without difficulty inferred from the following fact. Though he\r\nwas with extreme frequency forced to leave Macedonia by the Aetolian\r\nand Lacedaemonian wars, not only was there no disturbance in these\r\ncountries, but not a single one of the neighbouring barbarians\r\nventured to touch Macedonia. It would be impossible, again, to speak\r\nin strong enough terms of the affection of Alexander, Chrysogonus, and\r\nhis other friends towards him; or that of the Epirotes, Acarnanians,\r\nand all those on whom he had within a short time conferred great\r\nbenefits. On the whole, if one may use a somewhat hyperbolical phrase,\r\nI think it has been said of Philip with very great propriety, that\r\nhis beneficent policy had made him “The darling of all Greece.” And\r\nit is a conspicuous and striking proof of the advantage of lofty\r\nprinciple and strict integrity, that the Cretans, having at length\r\ncome to an understanding with each other and made a national alliance,\r\nselected Philip to arbitrate between them; and that this settlement\r\nwas completed without an appeal to arms and without danger,—a thing\r\nfor which it would be difficult to find a precedent in similar\r\ncircumstances. From the time of his exploits at Messene all this was\r\nutterly changed. And it was natural that it should be so. For his\r\npurposes being now entirely reversed, it inevitably followed that men’s\r\nopinions of him should be reversed also, as well as the success of\r\nhis various undertakings. This actually was the case, as will become\r\nevident to attentive students from what I am now about to relate....\r\n\r\n+13.+ Aratus seeing that Philip was now openly engaging in war with\r\nRome, and entirely changed in his policy toward his allies, with\r\ndifficulty diverted him from his intention by suggesting numerous\r\ndifficulties and scruples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5, 12.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation of the substance of book 7, viz. the\r\ntreacherous dealings of Philip with the Messenians, B.C. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plato, _Rep._ 565 D.]\r\n\r\nI wish now to remind my readers of what, in my fifth Book, I put\r\nforward merely as a promise and unsupported statement, but which\r\nhas now been confirmed by facts; in order that I may not leave any\r\nproposition of mine unproved or open to question. In the course of\r\nmy history of the Aetolian war, where I had to relate the violent\r\nproceedings of Philip in destroying the colonnades and other sacred\r\nobjects at Thermus; and added that, in consideration of his youth, the\r\nblame of these measures ought not to be referred to Philip so much as\r\nto his advisers; I then remarked that the life of Aratus sufficiently\r\nproved that he would not have committed such an act of wickedness,\r\nbut that such principles exactly suited Demetrius of Pharos; and I\r\npromised to make this clear from what I was next to narrate. I thereby\r\ndesignedly postponed the demonstration of the truth of my assertion,\r\ntill I had come to the period of which I have just been speaking; which\r\nwith the presence of Demetrius, and in the absence of Aratus, who\r\narrived a day too late, Philip made the first step in his career of\r\ncrime; and, as though from the first taste of human blood and murder\r\nand treason to his allies, was changed not into a wolf from a man, as\r\nin the Arcadian fable mentioned by Plato, but from a king into a savage\r\ntyrant. But a still more decisive proof of the sentiments of these two\r\nmen is furnished by the plot against the citadel of Messene, and may\r\nhelp us to make up our minds which of the two were responsible for the\r\nproceedings in the Aetolian war; and, when we are satisfied on that\r\npoint, it will be easy to form a judgment on the differences of their\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n+14.+ For as in this instance, under the influence of Aratus, Philip\r\nrefrained from actually breaking faith with the Messenians in regard\r\nto the citadel; and thus, to use a common expression, poured a little\r\nbalm into the wide wound which his slaughters had caused: so in the\r\nAetolian war, when under the influence of Demetrius, he sinned against\r\nthe gods by destroying the objects consecrated to them, and against man\r\nby transgressing the laws of war; and entirely deserted his original\r\nprinciples, by showing himself an implacable and bitter foe to all\r\nwho opposed him. The same remark applies to the Cretan business.[316]\r\nAs long as he employed Aratus as his chief director, not only without\r\ndoing injustice to a single islander, but without even causing them\r\nany vexation, he kept the whole Cretan people under control; and led\r\nall the Greeks to regard him with favour, owing to the greatness of\r\ncharacter which he displayed. So again, when under the guidance of\r\nDemetrius, he became the cause of the misfortunes I have described to\r\nthe Messenians, he at once lost the goodwill of the allies and his\r\ncredit with the rest of Greece. Such a decisive influence for good or\r\nevil in the security of their government has the choice by youthful\r\nsovereigns of the friends who are to surround them; though it is a\r\nsubject on which by some unaccountable carelessness they take not the\r\nsmallest care....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OF ANTIOCHUS WITH ACHAEUS\r\n\r\n(See 5, 107)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Sardis from the end of B.C. 216 to autumn of B.C.\r\n215.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ Round Sardis ceaseless and protracted skirmishes were taking\r\nplace and fighting by night and day, both armies inventing every\r\npossible kind of plot and counterplot against each other: to describe\r\nwhich in detail would be as useless as it would be in the last degree\r\nwearisome. At last, when the siege had already entered upon its second\r\nyear, Lagoras the Cretan came forward. He had had a considerable\r\nexperience in war, and had learnt that as a rule cities fall into the\r\nhands of their enemies most easily from some neglect on the part of\r\ntheir inhabitants, when, trusting to the natural or artificial strength\r\nof their defences, they neglect to keep proper guard and become\r\nthoroughly careless. He had observed too, that in such fortified cities\r\ncaptures were effected at the points of greatest strength, which were\r\nbelieved to have been despaired of by the enemy. So in the present\r\ninstance, when he saw that the prevailing notion of the strength of\r\nSardis caused the whole army to despair of taking it by storm, and\r\nto believe that the one hope of getting it was by starving it out,\r\nhe gave all the closer attention to the subject; and eagerly scanned\r\nevery possible method of making an attempt to capture the town. Having\r\nobserved therefore that a portion of the wall was unguarded, near a\r\nplace called the Saw, which unites the citadel and city, he conceived\r\nthe hope and idea of performing this exploit. He had discovered\r\nthe carelessness of the men guarding this wall from the following\r\ncircumstance. The place was extremely precipitous: and there was a deep\r\ngully below, into which dead bodies from the city, and the offal of\r\nhorses and beasts of burden that died, were accustomed to be thrown;\r\nand in this place therefore there was always a great number of vultures\r\nand other birds collected. Having observed, then, that when these\r\ncreatures were gorged, they always sat undisturbed upon the cliffs and\r\nthe wall, he concluded that the wall must necessarily be left unguarded\r\nand deserted for the larger part of the day. Accordingly, under cover\r\nof night, he went to the spot and carefully examined the possibilities\r\nof approaching it and setting ladders; and finding that this was\r\npossible at one particular rock, he communicated the facts to the king.\r\n\r\n+16.+ Antiochus encouraged the attempt and urged Lagoras to carry it\r\nout. The latter promised to do his best, and desired the king to join\r\nwith him Theodotus the Aetolian, and Dionysius the commander of his\r\nbodyguard, with orders to devote them to assist him in carrying out\r\nthe intended enterprise. The king at once granted his request, and\r\nthese officers agreed to undertake it: and having held a consultation\r\non the whole subject, they waited for a night on which there should be\r\nno moon just before daybreak. Such a night having arrived, on the day\r\non which they intended to act, an hour before sunset, they selected\r\nfrom the whole army fifteen of the strongest and most courageous men to\r\ncarry the ladders, and also to mount with them and share in the daring\r\nattempt. After these they selected thirty others, to remain in reserve\r\nat a certain distance; that, as soon as they had themselves climbed\r\nover the walls, and come to the nearest gate, the thirty might come up\r\nto it from the outside and try to knock off the hinges and fastenings,\r\nwhile they on the inside cut the cross bar and bolt pins.[317] They\r\nalso selected two thousand men to follow behind the thirty, who were to\r\nrush into the town with them and seize the area of the theatre, which\r\nwas a favourable position to hold against those on the citadel, as\r\nwell as those in the town. To prevent suspicion of the truth getting\r\nabout, owing to the picking out of the men, the king gave out that\r\nthe Aetolians were about to throw themselves into the town through a\r\ncertain gully, and that it was necessary, in view of that information,\r\nto take energetic measures to prevent them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The town of Sardis entered and sacked.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ When Lagoras and his party had made all their preparations, as\r\nsoon as the moon set, they came stealthily to the foot of the cliffs\r\nwith their scaling ladders, and ensconced themselves under a certain\r\noverhanging rock. When day broke, and the picket as usual broke up\r\nfrom that spot; and the king in the ordinary way told off some men to\r\ntake their usual posts, and led the main body on to the hippodrome and\r\ndrew them up; at first no one suspected what was going on. But when\r\ntwo ladders were fixed, and Dionysius led the way up one, and Lagoras\r\nup the other, there was excitement and a stir throughout the camp. For\r\nwhile the climbing party were not visible to the people in the town,\r\nor to Achaeus in the citadel, because of the beetling brow of the\r\nrock, their bold and adventurous ascent was in full view of the camp;\r\nwhich accordingly was divided in feeling between astonishment at the\r\nstrangeness of the spectacle, and a nervous horror of what was going\r\nto happen next, all standing dumb with exulting wonder. Observing the\r\nexcitement in the camp, and wishing to divert the attention both of\r\nhis own men and of those in the city from what was going on, the king\r\nordered an advance; and delivered an attack upon the gates on the other\r\nside of the town, called the Persian gates. Seeing from the citadel\r\nthe unwonted stir in the camp, Achaeus was for some time at a loss to\r\nknow what to do, being puzzled to account for it, and quite unable to\r\nsee what was taking place. However he despatched a force to oppose the\r\nenemy at the gate; whose assistance was slow in arriving, because they\r\nhad to descend from the citadel by a narrow and precipitous path. But\r\nAribazus, the commandant of the town, went unsuspiciously to the gates\r\non which he saw Antiochus advancing; and caused some of his men to\r\nmount the wall, and sent others out through the gate, with orders to\r\nhinder the approaching enemies, and come to close quarters with them.\r\n\r\n+18.+ Meanwhile Lagoras, Theodotus, Dionysius, and their men had\r\nclimbed the rocks and had arrived at the gate nearest them; and some\r\nof them were engaged in fighting the troops sent from the citadel to\r\noppose them, while others were cutting through the bars; and at the\r\nsame time the party outside told off for that service were doing the\r\nsame. The gates having thus been quickly forced open, the two thousand\r\nentered and occupied the area round the theatre. On this all the men\r\nfrom the walls, and from the Persian gate, to which Aribazus had\r\nalready led a relieving force, rushed in hot haste to pass the word to\r\nattack the enemy within the gates. The result was that, the gate having\r\nbeen opened as they retreated, some of the king’s army rushed in along\r\nwith the retiring garrison; and, when they had thus taken possession of\r\nthe gate, they were followed by an unbroken stream of their comrades;\r\nsome of whom poured through the gate, while others employed themselves\r\nin bursting open other gates in the vicinity. Aribazus and all the men\r\nin the city, after a brief struggle against the enemy who had thus\r\ngot within the walls, fled with all speed to the citadel. After that,\r\nTheodotus and Lagoras and their party remained on the ground near the\r\ntheatre, determining with great good sense and soldier-like prudence\r\nto form a reserve until the whole operation was completed; while the\r\nmain body rushed in on every side and occupied the town. And now by\r\ndint of some putting all they met to the sword, others setting fire to\r\nthe houses, others devoting themselves to plunder and taking booty, the\r\ndestruction and sacking of the town was completed. Thus did Antiochus\r\nbecome master of Sardis....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY OF CAUTION IN DEALING WITH AN ENEMY\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus [Cons. B.C. 215 and 213]\r\n\r\n+1.+ Tiberius a Roman Proconsul fell into an ambuscade, and, after\r\noffering with his attendants a gallant as he was advancing from Lucania\r\nto Capua, by the treachery of the Lucanian Flavius, B.C. 212. Livy, 25,\r\n16.] resistance to the enemy, was killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Archidamus, B.C. 226-225.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina with his fleet surprised and\r\ncaptured at Lipara, B.C. 260. See 1, 21.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Pelopidas in Thessaly, B.C. 363.]\r\n\r\nNow in regard to such catastrophes, whether it is right to blame or\r\npardon the sufferers is by no means a safe matter on which to pronounce\r\nan opinion; because it has happened to several men, who have been\r\nperfectly correct in all their actions, to fall into these misfortunes,\r\nequally with those who do not scruple to transgress principles of right\r\nconfirmed by the consent of mankind. We should not however idly refrain\r\nfrom pronouncing an opinion: but should blame or condone this or that\r\ngeneral, after a review of the necessities of the moment and the\r\ncircumstances of the case. And my observation will be rendered evident\r\nby the following instances. Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians,\r\nalarmed at the love of power which he observed in Cleomenes, fled\r\nfrom Sparta; but being not long afterwards persuaded to return, put\r\nhimself in the power of the latter. The consequence was that he lost\r\nhis kingdom and his life together,[318] and left a character not to be\r\ndefended before posterity on the score of prudence; for while affairs\r\nremained in the same state, and the ambition and power of Cleomenes\r\nremained in exactly the same position, how could he expect to meet any\r\nother fate than he did, if he put himself in the hands of the very men\r\nfrom whom he had before barely escaped destruction by flight? Again\r\nPelopidas of Thebes, though acquainted with the unprincipled character\r\nof the tyrant Alexander, and though he knew thoroughly well that\r\nevery tyrant regards the leaders of liberty as his bitterest enemies,\r\nfirst took upon himself to persuade Epaminondas to stand forth as the\r\nchampion of democracy, not only in Thebes, but in all Greece also; and\r\nthen, being in Thessaly in arms, for the express purpose of destroying\r\nthe absolute rule of Alexander, he yet twice ventured to undertake a\r\nmission to him. The consequence was that he fell into the hands of his\r\nenemies, did great damage to Thebes, and ruined the reputation he had\r\nacquired before; and all by putting a rash and ill advised confidence\r\nin the very last person in whom he ought to have done so. Very similar\r\nto these cases is that of the Roman Consul Gnaeus Cornelius who fell\r\nin the Sicilian war by imprudently putting himself in the power of the\r\nenemy. And many parallel cases might be quoted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Betrayal of Achaeus by Bolis. See _infra_, ch. 17-23.]\r\n\r\n+2.+ The conclusion, then, is that those who put themselves in the\r\npower of the enemy from want of proper precaution deserve blame;\r\nbut those who use every practicable precaution not so: for to trust\r\nabsolutely no one is to make all action impossible; but reasonable\r\naction, taken after receiving adequate security, cannot be censured.\r\nAdequate securities are oaths, children, wives, and, strongest of all,\r\na blameless past. To be betrayed and entrapped by such a security as\r\nany of these is a slur, not on the deceived, but on the deceiver. The\r\nfirst object then should be to seek such securities as it is impossible\r\nfor the recipient of the confidence to evade; but since such are rare,\r\nthe next best thing will be to take every reasonable precaution one’s\r\nself: and then, if we meet with any disaster, we shall at least be\r\nacquitted of wrong conduct by the lookers on. And this has been the\r\ncase with many before now: of which the most conspicuous example, and\r\nthe one nearest to the times on which we are engaged, will be the fate\r\nof Achaeus. He omitted no possible precaution for securing his safety,\r\nbut thought of everything that it was possible for human ingenuity\r\nto conceive: and yet he fell into the power of his enemies. In this\r\ninstance his misfortune procured the pity and pardon of the outside\r\nworld for the victim, and nothing but disparagement and loathing for\r\nthe successful perpetrators....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sardinia reduced by T.

III., B.C. 214.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ It appears to me not to be alien to my general purpose, and the\r\nplan which I originally laid down, to recall the attention of my\r\nreaders to the magnitude of the events, and the persistency of purpose\r\ndisplayed by the two States of Rome and Carthage. For who could think\r\nit otherwise than remarkable that these two powers, while engaged in so\r\nserious a war for the possession of Italy, and one no less serious for\r\nthat of Iberia; and being still both of them equally balanced between\r\nuncertain hopes and fears for the future of these wars, and confronted\r\nat the very time with battles equally formidable to either, should\r\nyet not be content with their existing undertakings: but should raise\r\nanother controversy as to the possession of Sardinia and Sicily; and\r\nnot content with merely hoping for all these things, should grasp at\r\nthem with all the resources of their wealth and warlike forces? Indeed\r\nthe more we examine into details the greater becomes our astonishment.\r\nThe Romans had two complete armies under the two Consuls on active\r\nservice in Italy; two in Iberia in which Gnaeus Cornelius commanded the\r\nland, Publius Cornelius the naval forces; and naturally the same was\r\nthe case with the Carthaginians. But besides this, a Roman fleet was\r\nanchored off Greece, watching it and the movements of Philip, of which\r\nfirst Marcus Valerius, and afterward Publius Sulpicius was in command.\r\nAlong with all these undertakings Appius with a hundred quinqueremes,\r\nand Marcus Claudius with an army, were threatening Sicily; while\r\nHamilcar was doing the same on the side of the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n+4.+ By means of these facts I presume that what I more than once\r\nasserted at the beginning of my work is now shown by actual experience\r\nto deserve unmixed credit. I mean my assertion, that it is impossible\r\nfor historians of particular places to get a view of universal history.\r\nFor how is it possible for a man who has only read a separate history\r\nof Sicilian or Spanish affairs to understand and grasp the greatness of\r\nthe events? Or, what is still more important, in what manner and under\r\nwhat form of polity fortune brought to pass that most surprising of\r\nall revolutions that have happened in our time, I mean the reduction\r\nof all known parts of the world under one rule and governance, a\r\nthing unprecedented in the history of mankind. In what manner the\r\nRomans took Syracuse or Iberia may be possibly learned to a certain\r\nextent by means of such particular histories; but how they arrived at\r\nuniversal supremacy, and what opposition their grand designs met with\r\nin particular places, or what on the other hand contributed to their\r\nsuccess, and at what epochs, this it is difficult to take in without\r\nthe aid of universal history. Nor, again, is it easy to appreciate the\r\ngreatness of their achievements except by the latter method. For the\r\nfact of the Romans having sought to gain Iberia, or at another time\r\nSicily; or having gone on a campaign with military and naval forces,\r\ntold by itself, would not be anything very wonderful. But if we learn\r\nthat these were all done at once, and that many more undertakings were\r\nin course of accomplishment at the same time,—all at the cost of one\r\ngovernment and commonwealth; and if we see what dangers and wars in\r\ntheir own territory were, at the very time, encumbering the men who had\r\nall these things on hand: thus, and only thus, will the astonishing\r\nnature of the events fully dawn upon us, and obtain the attention which\r\nthey deserve. So much for those who suppose that by studying an episode\r\nthey have become acquainted with universal history....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF SYRACUSE\r\n\r\n_Hieronymus succeeded his grandfather, Hiero, in B.C. 216, and was\r\nassassinated in Leontini thirteen months afterwards, in B.C. 215. His\r\ndeath, however, did not bring more peaceful relations between Syracuse\r\nand Rome, but only gave the Syracusans more able leaders (Livy, 24,\r\n21). After the slaughter of Themistius and Andramodorus, who had been\r\nelected on the board of Generals, and the cruel murder of all the\r\nroyal family, Epicydes and Hippocrates,—Syracusans by descent, but\r\nborn and brought up at Carthage, and who had been sent to Syracuse on\r\na special mission by Hannibal,—were elected into the vacant places in\r\nthe board of Generals. They became the leading spirits in the Syracusan\r\ngovernment, and for a time kept up an appearance of wishing to come\r\nto terms with Rome; and legates were actually sent to Marcellus, at\r\nMorgantia (near Catana). But when the Carthaginian fleet arrived at\r\nPachynus, Hippocrates and Epicydes threw off their mask, and declared\r\nthat the other magistrates were betraying the town to the Romans. This\r\naccusation was rendered more specious by the appearance of Appius with\r\na Roman fleet at the mouth of the harbour. A rush was made to the\r\nshore by the inhabitants to prevent the Romans landing; and the tumult\r\nwas with difficulty composed by the wisdom of one of the magistrates,\r\nApollonides, who persuaded the people to vote for the peace with Rome\r\n(B.C. 215. Livy, 24, 21-28). But Hippocrates and Epicydes determined\r\nnot to acknowledge the peace: they therefore provoked the Romans by\r\nplundering in or near the Roman pale,[319] and then took refuge in\r\nLeontini. Marcellus complained at Syracuse, but was told that Leontini\r\nwas not within Syracusan jurisdiction. Marcellus, therefore, took\r\nLeontini. Hippocrates and Epicydes managed to escape, and by a mixture\r\nof force and fraud contrived soon afterwards to force their way into\r\nSyracuse, seize and put to death most of the generals, and induce the\r\nexcited mob, whom they had inspired with the utmost dread of being\r\nbetrayed to Rome, to elect them sole generals (Livy, 24, 29-32). The\r\nRomans at once ordered Syracuse to be besieged, giving out that they\r\nwere coming not to wage war with the inhabitants, but to deliver them._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Siege of Syracuse, B.C. 215-214.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Archimedes.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ When Epicydes and Hippocrates had occupied Syracuse, and had\r\nalienated the rest of the citizens with themselves from the friendship\r\nof Rome, the Romans who had already been informed of the murder of\r\nHieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, appointed Appius Claudius as Propraetor\r\nto command a land force, while Marcus Claudius Marcellus commanded\r\nthe fleet. These officers took up a position not far from Syracuse,\r\nand determined to assault the town from the land at Hexapylus, and by\r\nsea at what was called Stoa Scytice in Achradina, where the wall has\r\nits foundation close down to the sea. Having prepared their wicker\r\npent-houses, and darts, and other siege material, they felt confident\r\nthat, with so many hands employed, they would in five days get their\r\nworks in such an advanced state as to give them the advantage over the\r\nenemy. But in this they did not take into account the abilities of\r\nArchimedes; nor calculate on the truth that, in certain circumstances,\r\nthe genius of one man is more effective than any numbers whatever.[320]\r\nHowever they now learnt it by experience. The city was strong from\r\nthe fact of its encircling wall lying along a chain of hills with\r\noverhanging brows, the ascent of which was no easy task, even with no\r\none to hinder it, except at certain definite points. Taking advantage\r\nof this, Archimedes had constructed such defences both in the town, and\r\nat the places where an attack might be made by sea, that the garrison\r\nwould have everything at hand which they might require at any moment,\r\nand be ready to meet without delay whatever the enemy might attempt\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sambucae or Harps.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ The attack was begun by Appius bringing his pent-houses, and\r\nscaling ladders, and attempting to fix the latter against that part of\r\nthe wall which abuts on Hexapylus towards the east. At the same time\r\nMarcus Claudius Marcellus with sixty quinqueremes was making a descent\r\nupon Achradina. Each of these vessels were full of men armed with bows\r\nand slings and javelins, with which to dislodge those who fought on\r\nthe battlements. As well as these vessels he had eight quinqueremes\r\nin pairs. Each pair had had their oars removed, one on the larboard\r\nand the other on the starboard side, and then had been lashed together\r\non the sides thus left bare. On these double vessels, rowed by the\r\nouter oars of each of the pair, they brought up under the walls some\r\nengines called “Sambucae,” the construction of which was as follows:—A\r\nladder was made four feet broad, and of a height to reach the top of\r\nthe wall from the place where its foot had to rest; each side of the\r\nladder was protected by a railing, and a covering or pent-house was\r\nadded overhead. It was then placed so that its foot rested across the\r\nsides of the lashed-together vessels, which touched each other with its\r\nother extremity protruding a considerable way beyond the prows. On the\r\ntops of the masts pulleys were fixed with ropes: and when the engines\r\nwere about to be used, men standing on the sterns of the vessels drew\r\nthe ropes tied to the head of the ladder, while others standing on\r\nthe prows assisted the raising of the machine and kept it steady with\r\nlong poles. Having then brought the ships close in shore by using the\r\nouter oars of both vessels they tried to let the machine down upon the\r\nwall. At the head of the ladder was fixed a wooden stage secured on\r\nthree sides by wicker-shields, upon which stood four men who fought\r\nand struggled with those who tried to prevent the Sambuca from being\r\nmade to rest on the battlements. But when they have fixed it and so\r\ngot above the level of the top of the wall, the four men unfasten the\r\nwicker-shields from either side of the stage, and walk out upon the\r\nbattlements or towers as the case may be; they are followed by their\r\ncomrades coming up by the Sambuca, since the ladder’s foot is safely\r\nsecured with ropes and stands upon both the ships. This construction\r\nhas got the name of “Sambuca,” or “Harp,” for the natural reason, that\r\nwhen it is raised the combination of the ship and ladder has very much\r\nthe appearance of such an instrument.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The engines invented by Archimedes. Cf. Plut. _Marcellus_,\r\n15.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 570 lbs. av.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ With such contrivances and preparations were the Romans intending\r\nto assault the towers. But Archimedes had constructed catapults to suit\r\nevery range; and as the ships sailing up were still at a considerable\r\ndistance, he so wounded the enemy with stones and darts, from the\r\ntighter wound and longer engines, as to harass and perplex them to the\r\nlast degree; and when these began to carry over their heads, he used\r\nsmaller engines graduated according to the range required from time\r\nto time, and by this means caused so much confusion among them as to\r\naltogether check their advance and attack; and finally Marcellus was\r\nreduced in despair to bringing up his ships under cover of night. But\r\nwhen they had come close to land, and so too near to be hit by the\r\ncatapults, they found that Archimedes had prepared another contrivance\r\nagainst the soldiers who fought from the decks. He had pierced the wall\r\nas high as a man’s stature with numerous loop-holes, which, on the\r\noutside, were about as big as the palm of the hand. Inside the wall he\r\nstationed archers and cross-bows, or scorpions,[321] and by the volleys\r\ndischarged through these he made the marines useless. By these means he\r\nnot only baffled the enemy, whether at a distance or close at hand, but\r\nalso killed the greater number of them. As often, too, as they tried\r\nto work their Sambucae, he had engines ready all along the walls, not\r\nvisible at other times, but which suddenly reared themselves above the\r\nwall from inside, when the moment for their use had come, and stretched\r\ntheir beams far over the battlements, some of them carrying stones\r\nweighing as much as ten talents, and others great masses of lead. So\r\nwhenever the Sambucae were approaching, these beams swung round on\r\ntheir pivot the required distance, and by means of a rope running\r\nthrough a pulley dropped the stone upon the Sambucae, with the result\r\nthat it not only smashed the machine itself to pieces, but put the ship\r\nalso and all on board into the most serious danger.\r\n\r\n+8.+ Other machines which he invented were directed against storming\r\nparties, who, advancing under the protection of pent-houses, were\r\nsecured by them from being hurt by missiles shot through the walls.\r\nAgainst these he either shot stones big enough to drive the marines\r\nfrom the prow; or let down an iron hand swung on a chain, by which the\r\nman who guided the crane, having fastened on some part of the prow\r\nwhere he could get a hold, pressed down the lever of the machine inside\r\nthe wall; and when he had thus lifted the prow and made the vessel rest\r\nupright on its stern, he fastened the lever of his machine so that it\r\ncould not be moved; and then suddenly slackened the hand and chain by\r\nmeans of a rope and pulley. The result was that many of the vessels\r\nheeled over and fell on their sides: some completely capsized; while\r\nthe greater number, by their prows coming down suddenly from a height,\r\ndipped low in the sea, shipped a great quantity of water, and became\r\na scene of the utmost confusion. Though reduced almost to despair by\r\nthese baffling inventions of Archimedes, and though he saw that all his\r\nattempts were repulsed by the garrison with mockery on their part and\r\nloss to himself, Marcellus could not yet refrain from making a joke at\r\nhis own expense, saying that “Archimedes was using his ships to ladle\r\nout the sea-water, but that his 'harps’ not having been invited to the\r\nparty were buffeted and turned out with disgrace.” Such was the end of\r\nthe attempt at storming Syracuse by sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The assault by land repulsed.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The siege turned into a blockade, B.C. 214. Coss. Q. Fabius\r\nMaximus IV. M. Claudius Marcellus III.]\r\n\r\n+9.+ Nor was Appius Claudius more successful. He, too, was compelled\r\nby similar difficulties to desist from the attempt; for while his\r\nmen were still at a considerable distance from the wall, they began\r\nfalling by the stones and shots from the engines and catapults. The\r\nvolleys of missiles, indeed, were extraordinarily rapid and sharp,\r\nfor their construction had been provided for by all the liberality\r\nof a Hiero, and had been planned and engineered by the skill of an\r\nArchimedes. Moreover, when they did at length get near the walls, they\r\nwere prevented from making an assault by the unceasing fire through\r\nthe loop-holes, which I mentioned before; or if they tried to carry\r\nthe place under cover of pent-houses, they were killed by the stones\r\nand beams let down upon their heads. The garrison also did them no\r\nlittle damage with those hands at the end of their engines; for they\r\nused to lift the men, armour, and all, into the air, and then throw\r\nthem down. At last Appius retired into the camp, and summoning the\r\nTribunes to a council of war, decided to try every possible means of\r\ntaking Syracuse except a storm. And this decision they carried out; for\r\nduring the eight months of siege which followed, though there was no\r\nstratagem or measure of daring which they did not attempt, they never\r\nagain ventured to attempt a storm. So true it is that one man and one\r\nintellect, properly qualified for the particular undertaking, is a\r\nhost in itself and of extraordinary efficacy. In this instance, at any\r\nrate, we find the Romans confident that their forces by land and sea\r\nwould enable them to become masters of the town, if only one old man\r\ncould be got rid of; while as long as he remained there, they did not\r\nventure even to think of making the attempt, at least by any method\r\nwhich made it possible for Archimedes to oppose them. They believed,\r\nhowever, that their best chance of reducing the garrison was by a\r\nfailure of provisions sufficient for so large a number as were within\r\nthe town; they therefore relied upon this hope, and with their ships\r\ntried to cut off their supplies by sea, and with their army by land.\r\nBut desiring that the time during which they were blockading Syracuse\r\nshould not be entirely wasted, but that some addition should be made to\r\ntheir power in other parts of the country, the two commanders separated\r\nand divided the troops between them: Appius Claudius keeping two-thirds\r\nand continuing the blockade, while Marcus Marcellus with the remaining\r\nthird went to attack the cities that sided with the Carthaginians....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s second devastation of Messene, B.C. 214.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: See Plutarch, _Aratus_, ch. 51. Cp. _supra_, 7, 10-14.]\r\n\r\n+10.+ Upon arriving in Messenia Philip began devastating the country,\r\nlike an open enemy, with more passion than reason; for while pursuing\r\nthis continuous course of injurious actions, he expected, it appears to\r\nme, that the sufferers would feel no anger or hatred towards him. I was\r\ninduced to speak of these proceedings in somewhat full detail in the\r\npresent as well as in the last book, not alone by the same motives as\r\nthose which I have assigned for other parts of my work, but also by the\r\nfact that of our historians, some have entirely omitted this Messenian\r\nepisode; while others from love or fear of kings have maintained that,\r\nso far from the outrages committed by Philip in defiance of religion\r\nand law upon the Messenians being a subject of blame, his actions were\r\non the contrary matters for praise and gratulation. But it is not\r\nonly in regard to the Messenians that we may notice the historians of\r\nPhilip acting thus; they have done much the same in other cases also.\r\nAnd the result is that their compositions have the appearance of a\r\npanegyric rather than of a history. I however hold that an historian\r\nought neither to blame or praise kings untruly, as has often been done;\r\nbut to make what we say consistent with what has been written before,\r\nand tally with the characters of the several persons in question. But\r\nit may be urged perhaps that this is easy to say, but very difficult\r\nto carry out; because situations and circumstances are so many and\r\nvarious, to which men have to give way in the course of their life,\r\nand which prevent them from speaking out their real opinions. This may\r\nexcuse some, but not others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The extravagance of Theopompus’s account of Philip II.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ I do not know any one who deserves more blame in this particular\r\nthan Theopompus. In the beginning of his history of Philip he said\r\nthat what chiefly induced him to undertake it was the fact that\r\nEurope had never produced such a man as Philip son of Amyntas; and\r\nthen immediately afterwards, both in his preface and in the whole\r\ncourse of his history, he represents this king as so madly addicted to\r\nwomen, that he did all that in him lay to ruin his own family by this\r\ninordinate passion; as having behaved with the grossest unfairness and\r\nperfidy to his friends and allies, as having enslaved and treacherously\r\nseized a vast number of towns by force or fraud; and as having been\r\nbesides so violently addicted to strong drink, that he was often\r\nseen by his friends drunk in open day. But if any one will take the\r\ntrouble to read the opening passage of his forty-ninth book, he would\r\nbe indeed astonished at this writer’s extravagance. Besides his other\r\nstrange statements he has ventured to write as follows—for I here\r\nsubjoin his actual words:—“If there was any one in all Greece, or among\r\nthe Barbarians, whose character was lascivious and shameless, he was\r\ninvariably attracted to Philip’s court in Macedonia and got the title\r\nof 'the king’s companion.’ For it was Philip’s constant habit to reject\r\nthose who lived respectably and were careful of their property; but to\r\nhonour and promote those who were extravagant, and passed their lives\r\nin drinking and dicing. His influence accordingly tended not only to\r\nconfirm them in these vices, but to make them proficients in every kind\r\nof rascality and lewdness. What vice or infamy did they not possess?\r\nWhat was there virtuous or of good report that they did not lack? Some\r\nof them, men as they were, were ever clean shaven and smooth-skinned;\r\nand even bearded men did not shrink from mutual defilement. They took\r\nabout with them two or three slaves of their lust, while submitting\r\nto the same shameful service themselves. The men whom they called\r\ncompanions deserved a grosser name, and the title of soldier was but\r\na cover to mercenary vice; for, though bloodthirsty by nature, they\r\nwere lascivious by habit. In a word, to make a long story short,\r\nespecially as I have such a mass of matter to deal with, I believe that\r\nthe so-called 'friends’ and 'companions’ of Philip were more bestial\r\nin nature and character than the Centaurs who lived on Pelion, or the\r\nLaestrygones who inhabited the Leontine plain, or in fact any other\r\nmonsters whatever.”[322]\r\n\r\n+12.+ Who would not disapprove of such bitterness and intemperance of\r\nlanguage in an historian? It is not only because his words contradict\r\nhis opening statement that he deserves stricture; but also because\r\nhe has libelled the king and his friends; and still more because his\r\nfalsehood is expressed in disgusting and unbecoming words. If he had\r\nbeen speaking of Sardanapalus, or one of his associates, he could\r\nhardly have ventured to use such foul language; and what that monarch’s\r\nprinciples and debauchery were in his lifetime we gather from the\r\ninscription on his tomb, which runs thus:\r\n\r\n   “The joys I had from love or wine\r\n   Or dainty meats—those now are mine.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vigorous characters of the Diadochi.]\r\n\r\nBut when speaking of Philip and his friends, a man ought to be on\r\nhis guard, not so much of accusing them of effeminacy and want of\r\ncourage, or still more of shameless immorality, but on the contrary\r\nlest he should prove unequal to express their praises in a manner\r\nworthy of their manliness, indefatigable energy, and the general\r\nvirtue of their character. It is notorious that by their energy and\r\nboldness they raised the Macedonian Empire from a most insignificant\r\nmonarchy to the first rank in reputation and extent. And, putting aside\r\nthe achievements of Philip, what was accomplished by them after his\r\ndeath, under the rule of Alexander, has secured for them a reputation\r\nfor valour with posterity universally acknowledged. For although a\r\nlarge share of the credit must perhaps be given to Alexander, as the\r\npresiding genius of the whole, though so young a man; yet no less is\r\ndue to his coadjutors and friends, who won many wonderful victories\r\nover the enemy; endured numerous desperate labours, dangers and\r\nsufferings; and, though put into possession of the most ample wealth,\r\nand the most abundant means of gratifying all their desires, never\r\nlost their bodily vigour by these means, or contracted tastes for\r\nviolence or debauchery. On the contrary, all those who were associated\r\nwith Philip, and afterwards with Alexander, became truly royal in\r\ngreatness of soul, temperance of life, and courage. Nor is it necessary\r\nto mention any names: but after Alexander’s death, in their mutual\r\nrivalries for the possession of various parts of nearly all the world,\r\nthey filled a very large number of histories with the record of their\r\nglorious deeds. We may admit then that the bitter invective of the\r\nhistorian Timaeus against Agathocles, despot of Sicily, though it seems\r\nunmeasured, has yet some reason in it,—for it is directed against a\r\npersonal enemy, a bad man, and a tyrant; but that of Theopompus is too\r\nscurrilous to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n+13.+ For, after premising that he is going to write about a king most\r\nrichly endowed by nature with virtue, he has raked up against him every\r\nshameful and atrocious charge that he could find. There are therefore\r\nbut two alternatives: either this writer in the preface to his work has\r\nshown himself a liar and a flatterer; or in the body of that history a\r\nfool and utter simpleton, if he imagined that by senseless and improper\r\ninvective he would either increase his own credit, or gain great\r\nacceptance for his laudatory expressions about Philip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thucydides breaks off in B.C. 411. Battle of Leuctra B.C.\r\n371.]\r\n\r\nBut the fact is that the general plan of this writer is one also which\r\ncan meet with no one’s approval. For having undertaken to write a\r\nGreek History from the point at which Thucydides left off, when he\r\ngot near the period of the battle of Leuctra, and the most splendid\r\nexploits of the Greeks, he threw aside Greece and its achievements in\r\nthe middle of his story, and, changing his purpose, undertook to write\r\nthe history of Philip. And yet it would have been far more telling and\r\nfair to have included the actions of Philip in the general history\r\nof Greece, than the history of Greece in that of Philip. For one\r\ncannot conceive of any one, who had been preoccupied by the study of a\r\nroyal government, hesitating, if he got the power and opportunity, to\r\ntransfer his attention to the great name and splendid personality of a\r\nnation like Greece; but no one in his senses, after beginning with the\r\nlatter, would have exchanged it for the showy biography of a tyrant.\r\nNow what could it have been that compelled Theopompus to overlook\r\nsuch inconsistencies? Nothing surely but this, that whereas the aim\r\nof his original history was honour, that of his history of Philip was\r\nexpediency. As to this deviation from the right path however, which\r\nmade him change the theme of his history, he might perhaps have had\r\nsomething to say, if any one had questioned him about it; but as to\r\nhis abominable language about the king’s friends, I do not think that\r\nhe could have said a word of defence, but must have owned to a serious\r\nbreach of propriety....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Aratus, B.C. 213.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ Though regarding the Messenians as open enemies, Philip was\r\nunable to inflict serious damage upon them, in spite of his setting\r\nto work to devastate their territory; but he was guilty of abominable\r\nconduct of the worst description to men who had been his most intimate\r\nfriends. For on the elder Aratus showing disapproval of his proceedings\r\nat Messene, he caused him not long afterwards to be made away with by\r\npoison, through the agency of Taurion who had charge of his interests\r\nin the Peloponnese. The crime was not known at the time by other\r\npeople; for the drug was not one of those which kill on the spot, but\r\nwas a slow poison producing a morbid state of the body. Aratus himself\r\nhowever was fully aware of the cause of his illness; and showed that he\r\nwas so by the following circumstance. Though he kept the secret from\r\nthe rest of the world, he did not conceal it from one of his servants\r\nnamed Cepholon, with whom he was on terms of great affection. This man\r\nwaited on him during his illness with great assiduity, and having one\r\nday pointed out some spittle on the wall which was stained with blood,\r\nAratus remarked, “That is the reward I have got for my friendship to\r\nPhilip.” Such a grand and noble thing is disinterested virtue, that\r\nthe sufferer was more ashamed, than the inflicter of the injury, of\r\nhaving it known, that, after so many splendid services performed in\r\nthe interests of Philip, he had got such a return as that for his\r\nloyalty.[323]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seventeen times Strategus. Plutarch, _Aratus_, 53.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of having been so often elected Strategus of the Achaean\r\nleague, and of having performed so many splendid services for that\r\npeople, Aratus after his death met with the honours he deserved, both\r\nin his own native city and from the league as a body. They voted him\r\nsacrifices and the honours of heroship, and in a word every thing\r\ncalculated to perpetuate his memory; so that, if the departed have any\r\nconsciousness, it is but reasonable to think that he feels pleasure at\r\nthe gratitude of the Achaeans, and at the thought of the hardships and\r\ndangers he endured in his life....\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP TAKES LISSUS IN ILLYRIA, B.C. 213\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lissus founded by Dionysius of Syracuse, B.C. 385. See Diod.\r\nSic. 15, 13.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ Philip had long had his thoughts fixed upon Lissus and its\r\ncitadel; and, being anxious to become master of those places, he\r\nstarted with his army, and after two days’ march got through the pass\r\nand pitched his camp on the bank of the river Ardaxanus, not far from\r\nthe town. He found on surveying the place that the fortifications of\r\nLissus, both on the side of the sea and of the land, were exceedingly\r\nstrong both by nature and art; and that the citadel, which was near it,\r\nfrom its extraordinary height and its other sources of strength, looked\r\nmore than any one could hope to carry by storm. He therefore gave up\r\nall hope of the latter, but did not entirely despair of taking the\r\ntown. He observed that there was a space between Lissus and the foot of\r\nthe Acrolissus which was fairly well suited for making an attempt upon\r\nthe town. He conceived the idea therefore of bringing on a skirmish in\r\nthis space, and then employing a strategem suited to the circumstances\r\nof the case. Having given his men a day for rest; and having in the\r\ncourse of it addressed them in suitable words of exhortation; he hid\r\nthe greater and most effective part of his light-armed troops during\r\nthe night in some woody gulleys, close to this space on the land side;\r\nand next morning marched to the other side of the town next the sea,\r\nwith his peltasts and the rest of his light-armed. Having thus marched\r\nround the town, and arrived at this spot, he made a show of intending\r\nto assault it at that point. Now as Philip’s advent had been no secret,\r\na large body of men from the surrounding country of Illyria had flocked\r\ninto Lissus; but feeling confidence in the strength of the citadel,\r\nthey had assigned a very moderate number of men to garrison it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Acrolissus taken by a feint, and Lissus afterwards.]\r\n\r\n+16.+ As soon therefore as the Macedonians approached, they began\r\npouring out of the town, confident in their numbers and in the strength\r\nof the places. The king stationed his peltasts on the level ground,\r\nand ordered the light-armed troops to advance towards the hills and\r\nenergetically engage the enemy. These orders being obeyed, the fight\r\nremained doubtful for a time; but presently Philip’s men yielded to the\r\ninequality of the ground, and the superior number of the enemy, and\r\ngave way. Upon their retreating within the ranks of the peltasts, the\r\nsallying party advanced with feelings of contempt, and having descended\r\nto the same level as the peltasts joined battle with them. But the\r\ngarrison of the citadel seeing Philip moving his divisions one after\r\nthe other slowly to the rear, and believing that he was abandoning\r\nthe field, allowed themselves to be insensibly decoyed out, in their\r\nconfidence in the strength of their fortifications; and thus, leaving\r\nthe citadel by degrees, kept pouring down by bye-ways into the lower\r\nplain, under the belief that they would have an opportunity of getting\r\nbooty and completing the enemy’s discomfiture. Meanwhile the division,\r\nwhich had been lying concealed on the side of the mainland, rose\r\nwithout being observed, and advanced at a rapid pace. At their approach\r\nthe peltasts also wheeled round and charged the enemy. On this the\r\ntroops from Lissus were thrown into confusion, and, after a straggling\r\nretreat, got safely back into the town; while the garrison which had\r\nabandoned the citadel got cut off from it by the rising of the troops\r\nwhich had been lying in ambush. The result accordingly was that what\r\nseemed hopeless, namely the capture of the citadel, was effected\r\nat once and without any fighting; while Lissus did not fall until\r\nnext day, and then only after desperate struggles, the Macedonians\r\nassaulting with vigour and even terrific fury. Thus Philip having,\r\nbeyond all expectation, made himself master of these places, reduced\r\nby this exploit all the neighbouring populations to obedience; so much\r\nso that the greater number of the Illyrians voluntarily surrendered\r\ntheir cities to his protection; for it had come to be believed that,\r\nafter the storming of such strongholds as these, no fortification and\r\nno provision for security could be of any avail against the might of\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAPTURE OF ACHAEUS AT SARDIS\r\n\r\n(See 7, 15-18)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 214. Sosibius secures the help of Bolis to rescue\r\nAchaeus.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ Bolis was by birth a Cretan, who had long enjoyed the honours of\r\nhigh military rank at King Ptolemy’s court, and the reputation of being\r\nsecond to none in natural ability, adventurous daring, and experience\r\nin war. By repeated arguments Sosibius secured this man’s fidelity;\r\nand when he felt sure of his zeal and affection he communicated the\r\nbusiness in hand to him. He told him that he could not do the king\r\na more acceptable service at the present crisis than by contriving\r\nsome way of saving Achaeus. At the moment Bolis listened, and retired\r\nwithout saying more than that he would consider the suggestion. But\r\nafter two or three days’ reflection, he came to Sosibius and said that\r\nhe would undertake the business; remarking that, having spent some\r\nconsiderable time at Sardis, he knew its topography, and that Cambylus,\r\nthe commander of the Cretan contingent of the army of Antiochus, was\r\nnot only a fellow citizen of his but a kinsmen and friend. It chanced\r\nmoreover that Cambylus and his men had in charge one of the outposts on\r\nthe rear of the acropolis, where the nature of the ground did not admit\r\nof siege-works, but was guarded by the permanent cantonment of troops\r\nunder Cambylus. Sosibius caught at the suggestion, convinced that, if\r\nAchaeus could be saved at all from his dangerous situation, it could be\r\nbetter accomplished by the agency of Bolis than of any one else; and,\r\nthis conviction being backed by great zeal on the part of Bolis, the\r\nundertaking was pushed on with despatch. Sosibius at once supplied the\r\nmoney necessary for the attempt, and promised a large sum besides in\r\ncase of its success; at the same time raising the hopes of Bolis to the\r\nutmost by dilating upon the favours he might look for from the king, as\r\nwell as from the rescued prince himself.\r\n\r\nFull of eagerness therefore for success, Bolis set sail without delay,\r\ntaking with him a letter in cipher and other credentials addressed\r\nto Nicomachus at Rhodes, who was believed to entertain a fatherly\r\naffection and devotion for Achaeus, and also to Melancomas at Ephesus;\r\nfor these were the men formerly employed by Achaeus in his negotiations\r\nwith Ptolemy, and in all other foreign affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bolis turns traitor.]\r\n\r\n+18.+ Bolis went to Rhodes, and thence to Ephesus; communicated his\r\npurpose to Nicomachus and Melancomas; and found them ready to do what\r\nthey were asked. He then despatched one of his staff, named Arianus,\r\nto Cambylus, with a message to the effect that he had been sent from\r\nAlexandria on a recruiting tour, and that he wished for an interview\r\nwith Cambylus on some matters of importance; he thought it therefore\r\nnecessary to have a time and place arranged for them to meet without\r\nthe privity of a third person. Arianus quickly obtained an interview\r\nwith Cambylus and delivered his message; nor was the latter at all\r\nunwilling to listen to the proposal. Having appointed a day, and a\r\nplace known to both himself and Bolis, at which he would be after\r\nnightfall, he dismissed Arianus. Now Bolis had all the subtlety of a\r\nCretan, and he accordingly weighed carefully in his own mind every\r\npossible line of action, and patiently examined every idea which\r\npresented itself to him. Finally he met Cambylus according to the\r\narrangement made with Arianus, and delivered his letter. This was\r\nnow made the subject of discussion between them in a truly Cretan\r\nspirit. They never took into consideration the means of saving the\r\nperson in danger, or their obligations of honour to those who had\r\nentrusted them with the undertaking, but confined their discussions\r\nentirely to the question of their own safety and their own advantage.\r\nAs they were both Cretans they were not long in coming to an unanimous\r\nagreement: which was, first of all, to divide the ten talents supplied\r\nby Sosibius between themselves in equal shares; and, secondly, to\r\ndiscover the whole affair to Antiochus, and to offer with his support\r\nto put Achaeus into his hands, on condition of receiving a sum of\r\nmoney and promises for the future, on a scale commensurate with the\r\ngreatness of the undertaking. Having settled upon this plan of action:\r\nCambylus undertook the negotiation with Antiochus, while to Bolis\r\nwas assigned the duty of sending Arianus within the next few days to\r\nAchaeus, bearing letters in cipher from Nicomachus and Melancomas: he\r\nbade Cambylus however take upon himself to consider how Arianus was\r\nto make his way into the acropolis and return with safety. “If,” said\r\nBolis, “Achaeus consents to make the attempt, and sends an answer to\r\nNicomachus and Melancomas, I will be ready to act and will communicate\r\nwith you.” Having thus arranged the parts which each was to take in the\r\nplot, they separated and set about their several tasks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The intended treason against Achaeus communicated to\r\nAntiochus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaeus is deceived.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ At the first opportunity Cambylus laid the proposal before the\r\nking. It was as acceptable to Antiochus as it was unexpected: in the\r\nfirst flush of his exultation he promised everything they asked; but\r\npresently feeling some distrust, he questioned Cambylus on every detail\r\nof their plan, and their means of carrying it out. Being eventually\r\nsatisfied on these points, and believing that the undertaking was under\r\nthe special favour of Providence, he repeatedly begged and prayed\r\nCambylus to bring it to a conclusion. Bolis was equally successful with\r\nNicomachus and Melancomas. They entertained no doubt of his sincerity,\r\nand joined him in the composition of letters to Achaeus,—composed in\r\na cipher which they had been accustomed to use,—to prevent any one\r\nwho got hold of the letter from making out its contents, exhorting\r\nhim to trust Bolis and Cambylus. So Arianus, having by the aid of\r\nCambylus made his way into the acropolis, delivered the letters to\r\nAchaeus; and having had personal acquaintance with the whole business\r\nfrom its commencement, he was able to give an account of every detail\r\nwhen questioned and cross-questioned again and again by Achaeus\r\nabout Sosibius and Bolis, about Nicomachus and Melancomas, and most\r\nparticularly about the part which Cambylus was taking in the affair. He\r\ncould of course stand this cross-examination with some air of sincerity\r\nand candour, because, in point of fact, he was not acquainted with the\r\nmost important part of the plan which Cambylus and Bolis had adopted.\r\nAchaeus was convinced by the answers returned by Arianus, and still\r\nmore by the cipher of Nicomachus and Melancomas; gave his answer; and\r\nsent Arianus back with it without delay. This kind of communication\r\nwas repeated more than once: and at last Achaeus entrusted himself\r\nwithout reserve to Nicomachus, there being absolutely no other hope of\r\nsaving himself left remaining, and bade him send Bolis with Arianus\r\non a certain moonless night, promising to place himself in their\r\nhands. The idea of Achaeus was, first of all, to escape his immediate\r\ndanger; and then by a circuitous route to make his way into Syria.\r\nFor he entertained very great hopes that, if he appeared suddenly\r\nand unexpectedly to the Syrians, while Antiochus was still lingering\r\nabout Sardis, he would be able to stir up a great movement, and meet\r\nwith a cordial reception from the people of Antioch, Coele-Syria, and\r\nPhoenicia.\r\n\r\nWith such expectations and calculations Achaeus was waiting for the\r\nappearance of Bolis.\r\n\r\n+20.+ Meanwhile Arianus had reached Melancomas, who, on reading the\r\nletter which he brought, immediately despatched Bolis with many words\r\nof exhortation and great promises of profit if he succeeded in his\r\nenterprise. Bolis sent Arianus in advance to signify his arrival to\r\nCambylus, and went after nightfall to their usual place of meeting.\r\nThere they spent a whole day together settling every detail of their\r\nplan of operations; and having done this they went into the camp under\r\ncover of night. The arrangement made between them was this. If it\r\nturned out that Achaeus came from the acropolis alone with Bolis and\r\nArianus, or with only one attendant, he would give them no cause for\r\nanxiety at all, but would be easily captured by the ambuscade set for\r\nhim. If, on the other hand, he should be accompanied by a considerable\r\nnumber, the business would be one of some difficulty to those on whose\r\ngood faith he relied; especially as they were anxious to capture him\r\nalive, that being what would most gratify Antiochus. In that case,\r\ntherefore, Arianus, while conducting Achaeus, was to go in front,\r\nbecause he knew the path by which he had on several occasions effected\r\nhis entrance and return; Bolis was to bring up the rear, in order that,\r\nwhen they arrived at the spot where Cambylus was to have his ambuscade\r\nready, he might lay hold on Achaeus, and prevent his getting away\r\nthrough wooded ground, in the confusion and darkness of the night, or\r\nthrowing himself in his terror from some precipice; thus they would\r\nsecure that he fell, as they intended, into his enemies’ hands alive.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements having been agreed upon, Bolis was taken by Cambylus\r\non the very night of his arrival, without any one else, and introduced\r\nto Antiochus. The king was alone and received them graciously; he\r\npledged himself to the performance of his promises, and urged them both\r\nagain and again not to postpone any longer the performance of their\r\npurpose. Thereupon they returned for the present to their own camp;\r\nbut towards morning Bolis, accompanied by Arianus, ascended to the\r\nacropolis, and entered it before daybreak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaeus takes vain precautions.]\r\n\r\n+21.+ Achaeus received them with warmth and cordiality, and questioned\r\nBolis at great length on every detail. From the expression of his\r\nface, and his conversation, he judged Bolis to be a man of a character\r\nweighty enough for so serious an undertaking; but while at one time he\r\nexulted in the prospect of his release, at another, he grew painfully\r\nexcited, and was torn with an agony of anxiety at the gravity of the\r\nissues at stake. But no one had a clearer head or greater experience in\r\naffairs than he; and in spite of the good opinion he had formed of him,\r\nhe still determined that his safety should not depend entirely on the\r\ngood faith of Bolis. He accordingly told him that it was impossible for\r\nhim to leave the acropolis at the moment: but that he would send some\r\ntwo or three of his friends with him, and by the time that they had\r\njoined Melancomas he would be prepared to depart. So Achaeus did all\r\nhe could for his security; but he did not know that he was trying to\r\ndo what the proverb declares to be impossible—out-cretan a Cretan. For\r\nthere was no trick likely to be tried that Bolis had not anticipated.\r\nHowever when the night came, in which Achaeus said that he would send\r\nhis friends with them, he sent on Arianus and Bolis to the entrance of\r\nthe acropolis, with instructions to wait there until those who were\r\nto go with them arrived. They did as he bade them. Achaeus then, at\r\nthe very moment of his departure, communicated his plan to his wife\r\nLaodice; and she was so terrified at his sudden resolve, that he had to\r\nspend some time in entreating her to be calm, in soothing her feelings,\r\nand encouraging her by pointing out the hopes which he entertained.\r\nThis done he started with four companions, whom he dressed in ordinary\r\nclothes, while he himself put on a mean and common dress and disguised\r\nhis rank as much as possible. He selected one of his four companions to\r\nbe always prepared to answer anything said by Arianus, and to ask any\r\nnecessary question of him, and bade him say that the other four did not\r\nspeak Greek.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaeus made prisoner.]\r\n\r\n+22.+ The five then joined Arianus, and they all started together on\r\ntheir journey. Arianus went in front, as being acquainted with the\r\nway; while Bolis took up his position behind in accordance with the\r\noriginal plan, puzzled and annoyed at the way things were turning out.\r\nFor, Cretan as he was, and ready to suspect every one he came near, he\r\nyet could not make out which of the five was Achaeus, or whether he\r\nwas there at all. But the path was for the most part precipitous and\r\ndifficult, and in some places there were abrupt descents which were\r\nslippery and dangerous; and whenever they came to one of these, some\r\nof the four gave Achaeus a hand down, and the others caught him at the\r\nbottom, for they could not entirely conceal their habitual respect\r\nfor him; and Bolis was quick to detect, by observing this, which of\r\nthem was Achaeus. When therefore they arrived at the spot at which it\r\nhad been arranged that Cambylus was to be, Bolis gave the signal by\r\na whistle, and the men sprang from their places of concealment and\r\nseized the other four, while Bolis himself caught hold of Achaeus, at\r\nthe same time grasping his mantle, as his hands were inside it; for\r\nhe was afraid that having a sword concealed about his person he would\r\nattempt to kill himself when he understood what was happening. Being\r\nthus quickly surrounded on every side, Achaeus fell into the hands of\r\nhis enemies, and along with his four friends was taken straight off to\r\nAntiochus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achaeus brought to Antiochus, sentenced and executed.]\r\n\r\nThe king was in his tent in a state of extreme anxiety awaiting the\r\nresult. He had dismissed his usual court, and, with the exception\r\nof two or three of the bodyguard, was alone and sleepless. But when\r\nCambylus and his men entered, and placed Achaeus in chains on the\r\nground, he fell into a state of speechless astonishment: and for a\r\nconsiderable time could not utter a word, and finally overcome by a\r\nfeeling of pity burst into tears; caused, I have no doubt, by this\r\nexhibition of the capriciousness of Fortune, which defies precaution\r\nand calculation alike. For here was Achaeus, a son of Andromachus, the\r\nbrother of Seleucus’s queen Laodice, and married to Laodice, a daughter\r\nof King Mithridates, and who had made himself master of all Asia this\r\nside of Taurus, and who at that very moment was believed by his own\r\narmy, as well as by that of his enemy, to be safely ensconced in the\r\nstrongest position in the world,—sitting chained upon the ground, in\r\nthe hands of his enemies, before a single person knew of it except\r\nthose who had effected the capture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The citadel of Sardis surrendered.]\r\n\r\n+23.+ And, indeed, when at daybreak the king’s friends assembled as\r\nusual at his tent, and saw this strange spectacle, they too felt\r\nemotions very like those of the king; while extreme astonishment\r\nmade them almost disbelieve the evidence of their senses. However\r\nthe council met, and a long debate ensued as to what punishment they\r\nwere to inflict upon Achaeus. Finally, it was resolved that his\r\nextremities should be cut off, his head severed from his body and sewn\r\nup in the skin of an ass, and his body impaled. When this sentence\r\nhad been carried out, and the army learnt what had happened, there\r\nwas such excitement in the ranks and such a rush of the soldiers to\r\nthe spectacle, that Laodice on the acropolis, who alone knew that her\r\nhusband had left it, guessed what had happened from the commotion and\r\nstir in the camp. And before long a herald arrived, told Laodice what\r\nhad happened to Achaeus, and ordered her to resign the command and\r\nquit the acropolis. At first any answer was prevented by an outburst\r\nof sorrow and overpowering lamentation on the part of the occupants of\r\nthe acropolis; not so much from affection towards Achaeus, as from the\r\nsuddenness and utter unexpectedness of the catastrophe. But this was\r\nsucceeded by a feeling of hesitation and dismay; and Antiochus, having\r\ngot rid of Achaeus, never ceased putting pressure on the garrison of\r\nthe acropolis, feeling confident that a means of taking it would be put\r\ninto his hands by those who occupied it, and most probably by the rank\r\nand file of the garrison. And this is just what did finally happen:\r\nfor the soldiers split up into factions, one joining Ariobazus, the\r\nother Laodice. This produced mutual distrust, and before long both\r\nparties surrendered themselves and the acropolis. Thus Achaeus, in\r\nspite of having taken every reasonable precaution, lost his life by\r\nthe perfidy of those in whom he trusted. His fate may teach posterity\r\ntwo useful lessons,—not to put faith in any one lightly; and not to\r\nbe over-confident in the hour of prosperity, knowing that, in human\r\naffairs, there is no accident which we may not expect....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALLIC KING, CAUARUS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cauarus, king of the Gauls, settled on the Hellespont. See\r\n4, 46 and 52.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ Cauarus, king of the Gauls in Thrace, was of a truly royal and\r\nhigh-minded disposition, and gave the merchants sailing into the Pontus\r\ngreat protection, and rendered the Byzantines important services in\r\ntheir wars with the Thracians and Bithynians....\r\n\r\nThis king, so excellent in other respects, was corrupted by a flatterer\r\nnamed Sostratus, who was a Chalchedonian by birth....\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIOCHUS THE GREAT AT ARMOSATA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In the course of his campaigns for the recovering of the\r\neastern provinces (B.C. 212-205), Antiochus makes a demonstration\r\nbefore the city of Armosata, in Armenia, to recover the arrears of\r\ntribute owed by the late king, B.C. 212.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ In the reign of Xerxes, prince of the city of Armosata, situated\r\non the “Fair Plain,” between the Tigris and Euphrates, King Antiochus\r\nencamped under its walls and prepared to attack it. When he saw the\r\nking’s forces, Xerxes at first conveyed himself away; but feeling\r\nafterwards that, if his palace were seized by his enemies, his whole\r\nkingdom would be overthrown, he changed his mind, and sent a message\r\nto Antiochus declaring his wish for a conference. The most loyal of\r\nthe friends of Antiochus were against letting the young prince go when\r\nthey once got him into their hands, and advised Antiochus to take\r\npossession of the town, and hand over the principality to Mithridates,\r\nhis own sister’s son. The king, however, would not listen to any of\r\nthese suggestions; but sent for the young prince and accommodated\r\ntheir differences, forgiving him the larger part of the money which\r\nhe allowed to be owing from his father under the head of tribute,\r\nand accepting a present payment from him of three hundred talents, a\r\nthousand horses, and a thousand mules with their trappings. He then\r\nsettled the government of the city, and gave the prince his sister\r\nAntiochis as a wife. By these proceedings, in which he was thought\r\nto have acted with true royal magnanimity, he won the affection and\r\nsupport of all the inhabitants of that part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANNIBALIAN WAR—TARENTUM\r\n\r\n+26.+ It was in the wantonness of excessive prosperity that the\r\nTarentines invited Pyrrhus of Epirus; for democratic liberty that has\r\nenjoyed a long and unchecked career comes naturally to experience a\r\nsatiety of its blessings, and then it looks out for a master; and when\r\nit has got one, it is not long before it hates him, because it is seen\r\nthat the change is for the worse. This is just what happened to the\r\nTarentines on that occasion....\r\n\r\nOn this news being brought to Tarentum and Thurii there was great\r\npopular indignation....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal marched south early in B.C. 212 to renew his\r\nattempt upon Tarentum, on which he had wasted much of the previous\r\nsummer (Livy, 25, 1). The severity of the punishment of the Tarentine\r\nhostages who tried to escape from Rome caused a conspiracy of\r\nTarentines to betray the town to Hannibal. Livy, 25, 7-8.]\r\n\r\nThe conspirators left the town at first under the pretext of a\r\nforay, and got near Hannibal’s camp before daybreak. Then, while\r\nthe rest crouched down on a certain wooded spot by the side of the\r\nroad, Philemenus and Nicon went up to the camp. They were seized by\r\nthe sentries and taken off to Hannibal, without saying a word as to\r\nwhere they came from or who they were, but simply stating that they\r\nwished for an interview with the general. Being taken without delay to\r\nHannibal they said that they wished to speak with him privately. He\r\nassented with the utmost readiness; whereupon they explained to him\r\ntheir own position and that of their native city, charging the Romans\r\nwith many various acts of oppression, that they might not seem to be\r\nentering on their present undertaking without good reason. For the\r\npresent Hannibal dismissed them with thanks and a cordial acceptance\r\nof their proposed movement, and charging them to come back very soon\r\nand have another interview with him. “This time,” he added, “when you\r\nget at a sufficient distance from the camp, take possession of the\r\nfirst cattle you find being driven out to pasture in the early morning,\r\nand go off boldly with them and their herdsmen; for I will take care\r\nthat you are unmolested.” His object in doing this was to give himself\r\ntime to inquire into the tale of the young men; and also to confirm\r\ntheir credit with their fellow-citizens, by making it appear that\r\ntheir expedition had really been for the purpose of foraging. Nicon\r\nand his companions did as they were bidden, and left Hannibal in great\r\nexultation at having at last got an opportunity of completing his\r\nenterprise: while they themselves were made all the more eager to carry\r\nout their plot by having been able to accomplish their interview with\r\nHannibal without danger, and by having found him warmly disposed to\r\ntheir undertaking, and by having besides gained the confidence of their\r\nown people by the considerable amount of booty which they had brought\r\nhome. This they partly sold and partly used in splendid entertainments,\r\nand thus not only were believed in by the Tarentines, but excited a\r\nconsiderable number to emulate their exploit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bargain made with Hannibal.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ On their next expedition, which they conducted in the same way\r\nas the first, they interchanged pledges of fidelity with Hannibal on\r\nthe following conditions: “He was to set the Tarentines free; and the\r\nCarthaginians were neither to exact tribute of any sort from them,\r\nnor impose any burden upon them; but the houses and lodgings occupied\r\nby Romans should, on their taking possession of the town, be given up\r\nto the Carthaginians to plunder.” They also arranged on a watchword\r\nat which the sentries were to admit them without delay into the\r\ncamp whenever they came. After making these arrangements, they got\r\nthe opportunity of often having interviews with Hannibal: sometimes\r\npretending to be going out of the town on a foray, and sometimes on\r\na hunting expedition. Everything having thus been put in train, the\r\ngreater part of the conspirators waited for the proper occasions\r\nfor acting, while they assigned to Philemenus the part of leader of\r\ntheir hunting excursions; for, owing to his excessive taste for that\r\namusement, he had the reputation of thinking hunting the most important\r\nthing in life. Accordingly they left it to him, first to win the favour\r\nof Gaius Livius the commander of the town by presents of game, and then\r\nthat of the guards of the gate-tower which protected what were called\r\nthe Temenid gates. Philemenus undertook the task: and partly by what he\r\ncaught himself, and partly with what Hannibal supplied, always managed\r\nto bring in some game; which he divided between Livius and the guards\r\nof the gate, to induce them to be always ready to open the wicket to\r\nhim. For he generally went and returned from his expeditions after\r\nnightfall, under the pretext of being afraid of the enemy, but really\r\nwith a view of preparing for the plot. When Philemenus then had managed\r\nto make it a regular arranged thing with the picket at the gate, that\r\nthe guards should have no hesitation; but that, whenever he came under\r\nthe wall and whistled, they should open the wicket to him; he waited\r\nfor a day on which the Roman commander of the town was engaged to be\r\npresent at a large party, meeting early in the Musaeum, which is near\r\nthe agora, and agreed with Hannibal to carry out their plot on that day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal prepares to act.]\r\n\r\n+28.+ For some time before this, Hannibal had given out that he was\r\nill, to prevent the Romans wondering when they were told of his staying\r\nso long on the same ground; and he now made a greater pretence than\r\never of ill-health, and remained encamped three days’ march from\r\nTarentum. But when the time was come, he got ready the most conspicuous\r\nfor their speed and daring in his cavalry and infantry, to the number\r\nof about ten thousand, and gave orders that they should take provisions\r\nfor four days. He started just before daybreak, and marched at full\r\nspeed; having told off eighty Numidian horsemen to keep thirty stades\r\nahead, and to scour the country on both sides of the road; so that\r\nno one might get a sight of the main body, but might either be taken\r\nprisoners by this advanced guard, or, if he escaped, might carry a\r\nreport of it into the city as if it were merely a raid of Numidian\r\nhorsemen. When the Numidians were about a hundred and twenty stades\r\nfrom the town, Hannibal halted his men for supper by the side of a\r\nriver flowing through a deep gully, and offering excellent cover; and\r\nhaving summoned his officers, did not indeed tell them outright what\r\nthe service was on which they were going, but simply exhorted them,\r\nfirst to show themselves brave men, as the prize awaiting them was the\r\ngreatest they had ever had; and, secondly, that each should keep the\r\nmen of his own company well together, and rebuke sharply all who left\r\ntheir own division on any pretext whatever; and, thirdly, to attend\r\nstrictly to orders, and not attempt anything on their own account\r\noutside them. Dismissing the officers with these words, he got his\r\ntroops on the march just after dark, being very anxious to reach the\r\nwall about midnight; having Philemenus to act as guide, and having got\r\nready for him a wild-boar to enable him to sustain the part which he\r\nwas to perform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gaius Livius thrown off the scent.]\r\n\r\n+29.+ About sunset news was brought to Gaius Livius, who had been\r\nwith his friends in the Musaeum since early in the day, just when\r\nthe drinking was at its height, that the Numidians were scouring\r\nthe country. He therefore took measures for that and nothing more,\r\ncalling some of his officers and bidding them take half the cavalry,\r\nand sally out to stop the progress of the enemy, who were devastating\r\nthe country: but this only made him still more unsuspicious of the\r\nwhole extent of the movement. Nicon, Tragiscus, and their confederates\r\ncollected together at nightfall in the town and waited for the return\r\nof Livius and his friends. As these last rose from table somewhat\r\nearly, because the banquet had begun before the usual time, the\r\ngreater number of the conspirators retired to a certain spot and there\r\nremained; but some of the younger men went to meet Gaius, imitating by\r\ntheir disorderly procession and mutual jests a company returning from\r\na carouse. As Livius and his company were even more flustered with\r\ndrink, as soon as they met laughter and joking were readily excited\r\non both sides. Finally, they turned and conducted Gaius to his house;\r\nwhere he went to bed full of wine, as might be expected after a party\r\nbeginning so early in the day, without any anxiety or trouble in\r\nhis thoughts, but full of cheerfulness and idle content. Then Nicon\r\nand Tragiscus rejoined their companions, and, dividing themselves\r\ninto three companies, took up their positions at the most favourable\r\npoints in the market-place, to keep themselves fully acquainted with\r\neverything reported from outside the walls, or that happened within\r\nthe city itself. They posted some also close to the house of Livius:\r\nbeing well aware that, if any suspicion of what was coming arose, it\r\nwould be to him that the news would be first brought, and that from him\r\nevery measure taken would originate. So when the noise of the returning\r\nguests, and every disturbance of the sort, had subsided, and the great\r\nbulk of the citizens was asleep; and now the night was advancing, and\r\nnothing had happened to dash their hopes, they collected together and\r\nproceeded to perform their part of the undertaking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why the Tarentines bury within the walls.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ The arrangements between these young men and Hannibal were these.\r\nHannibal was to arrive at the town by the inland road and on the\r\neastern side near the Temenid gates; and when there, was to light a\r\nfire on the tomb, which some called the tomb of Hyacinthus, and others\r\nof Apollo: Tragiscus and his confederates, when they saw this, were to\r\nlight an answering fire from within the walls. This done, Hannibal was\r\nto put out his fire and advance slowly towards the gate. In pursuance\r\nof these arrangements, the young men marched through the inhabited part\r\nof the town and came to the tombs. For the eastern quarter of Tarentum\r\nis full of monuments, because those who die there are to this day all\r\nburied within the walls, in obedience to an ancient oracle. For it is\r\nsaid that the god delivered this answer to the Tarentines, “That it\r\nwere better and more profitable for them if they made their dwelling\r\nwith the majority”; and they thought therefore that they would be\r\nliving in accordance with the oracle if they kept the departed within\r\nthe walls. That is why to this day they bury inside the gates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal arrives and gets into the town.]\r\n\r\nThe young men, then, having gone as far as the tomb of Pythionicus,\r\nwaited to see what would happen. Presently Hannibal arrived and did\r\nas arranged: whereupon Nicon and Tragiscus with renewed courage\r\ndisplayed their beacon also; and, as soon as they saw the fire of the\r\nCarthaginians being put out, they ran to the gates as fast as they\r\ncould go, wishing to get the picket at the gate tower killed before\r\nthe Carthaginians arrived; as it had been agreed that they should\r\nadvance leisurely and at a foot’s pace. Everything went smoothly: the\r\nguards were overpowered; and while some of the young men were engaged\r\nin killing them, others were cutting the bolts. The gates having been\r\nquickly thrown open, Hannibal arrived at the right moment, having so\r\ntimed his march that he never had to stop on the way to the town at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philemenus also gets in.]\r\n\r\n+31.+ Having thus effected their intended entrance, without danger or\r\nany disturbance whatever, and thinking that the most important part\r\nof their undertaking was accomplished, the Carthaginians now began\r\nadvancing boldly along the street leading up from what is called the\r\nBatheia or Deep Road. They left the cavalry however outside the walls,\r\nnumbering as many as two thousand, intending them to act as a reserve\r\nboth in case of any appearance of the enemy from without, and of any of\r\nthose unforeseen casualties which do occur in such operations. But when\r\nthey had come to the immediate neighbourhood of the market-place, they\r\nhalted, and waited to see how the attempt of Philemenus would turn out:\r\nbeing anxious as to the success of this part of their plan as well as\r\nthe other. For at the same moment that he lighted his fire, and was on\r\nthe point of starting for the gates, Hannibal had despatched Philemenus\r\nalso, with his boar on a litter, and a thousand Libyans, to the next\r\ngate; wishing, in accordance with his original design, not to depend\r\nsolely on one chance, but to have several. When Philemenus, then,\r\narrived at the wall and gave his customary signal by whistling, the\r\nsentry immediately appeared coming down to open the wicket; and when\r\nPhilemenus told him from outside to open quickly because they had a\r\ngreat weight to carry, as they were bringing a wild boar, he made haste\r\nto open the wicket, expecting that some of the game which Philemenus\r\nwas conveying would come his way, as he had always had a share of what\r\nwas brought in.\r\n\r\nThereupon Philemenus himself, being at the head of the litter, entered\r\nfirst; and with him another dressed like a shepherd, as though he\r\nwere one of the country folk of those parts; and after him two others\r\nbesides who were carrying the dead beast behind. But when the four had\r\ngot inside the wicket, they struck and killed the man who opened it,\r\nas he was unsuspiciously examining and feeling the boar, and then let\r\nthe men who were just behind them, and were in advance of the main body\r\nof Libyan horsemen, to the number of thirty, leisurely and quietly\r\nthrough. This having been accomplished without a hitch, some set about\r\ncutting the bolts, others were engaged in killing the picket on duty at\r\nthe gate, and others in giving the signal to the Libyans still outside\r\nto come in. These having also effected their entrance in safety, they\r\nbegan making their way towards the market-place according to the\r\narrangement. As soon as he was joined by this division also, in great\r\ndelight at the successful progress of the operation, Hannibal proceeded\r\nto carry out the next step.\r\n\r\n+32.+ He told off two thousand of his Celts: and, having divided them\r\ninto three companies, he assigned two of the young men who had managed\r\nthe plot to each company; and sent with them also certain of his own\r\nofficers, with orders to close up the several most convenient streets\r\nthat led to the market-place. And when he had done this, he bade the\r\nyoung men of the town pick out and save those of their fellow-citizens\r\nwhom they might chance to meet, by shouting out before they came up\r\nwith them, “That Tarentines should remain where they were, as they were\r\nin no danger”; but he ordered both Carthaginian and Celtic officers to\r\nkill all the Romans they met.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Escape of Livius into the Citadel.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Massacre of Roman soldiers.]\r\n\r\nSo these companies separated and proceeded to carry out their orders.\r\nBut when the entrance of the enemy became known to the Tarentines, the\r\ncity began to be full of shouting and extraordinary confusion. As for\r\nGaius, when the enemy’s entrance was announced to him, being fully\r\naware that his drunkenness had incapacitated him, he rushed straight\r\nout of the house with his servants, and having come to the gate leading\r\nto the harbour, and the sentinel having opened the wicket for him,\r\nhe got through that way; and having seized one of the boats lying at\r\nanchor there, went on board it with his servants and arrived safely at\r\nthe citadel. Meanwhile Philemenus had provided himself with some Roman\r\nbugles, and some men who were able to blow them, from being used to\r\ndo so; and they stood in the theatre and sounded a call to arms. The\r\nRomans promptly rallying in arms, as was their custom at this sound,\r\nand directing their steps towards the citadel, everything happened\r\nexactly as the Carthaginians intended; for as the Roman soldiers came\r\ninto the streets, without any order and in scattered groups, some of\r\nthem came upon the Carthaginians and others upon the Celts; and by\r\ntheir being in this way put to the sword in detail, a very considerable\r\nnumber of them perished.\r\n\r\nBut when day began to break, the Tarentines kept quietly in their\r\nhouses, not yet being able to comprehend what was happening. For thanks\r\nto the bugle, and the absence of all outrage or plundering in the town,\r\nthey thought that the movement arose from the Romans themselves. But\r\nthe sight of many of the latter lying killed in the streets, and the\r\nspectacle of some Gauls openly stripping the Roman corpses, suggested a\r\nsuspicion of the presence of the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roman houses sacked, Tarentines spared.]\r\n\r\n+33.+ Presently when Hannibal had marched his forces into the\r\nmarket-place, and the Romans had retired into the citadel, as having\r\nbeen previously secured by them with a garrison, and it had become\r\nbroad daylight, the Carthaginian general caused a proclamation to be\r\nmade to the Tarentines to assemble in full number in the market-place;\r\nwhile the young conspirators went meanwhile round the town talking\r\nloudly about liberty, and bidding everybody not to be afraid, for the\r\nCarthaginians had come to save them. Such of the Tarentines as held\r\nto their loyalty to Rome, upon learning the state of the case, went\r\noff to the citadel; but the rest came to the meeting, in obedience to\r\nthe proclamation, without their arms: and to them Hannibal addressed\r\na cordial speech. The Tarentines heartily cheered everything he said\r\nfrom joy at their unexpected safety; and he dismissed the crowd with\r\nan injunction to each man, to go with all speed to his own house, and\r\nwrite over the door, “A Tarentine’s”; but if any one wrote the same\r\nword on a house where a Roman was living, he declared the penalty to\r\nbe death. He then personally told off the best men he had for the\r\nservice, and sent them to plunder the houses of the Romans; giving them\r\nas their instructions to consider all houses which had no inscription\r\nas belonging to the enemy: the rest of his men he kept drawn up as a\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fortifications raised to preserve the town from attack from\r\nthe citadel.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ A vast quantity of miscellaneous property having been got\r\ntogether by this plundering, and a booty fully answering the\r\nexpectations of the Carthaginians, they bivouacked for that night\r\nunder arms. But the next day, after consulting with the Tarentines,\r\nHannibal decided to cut off the city from the citadel by a wall, that\r\nthe Tarentines might not any longer be under continual alarm from the\r\nRomans in possession of the citadel. His first measure was to throw\r\nup a palisade, parallel to the wall of the citadel and to the trench\r\nin front of it. But as he very well knew that the enemy would not\r\nallow this tamely, but would make a demonstration of their power in\r\nthat direction, he got ready for the work a number of his best hands,\r\nthinking that the first thing necessary was to overawe the Romans and\r\ngive confidence to the Tarentines. But as soon as the first palisade\r\nwas begun, the Romans began a bold and determined attack; whereupon\r\nHannibal, offering just enough resistance to induce the rest to come\r\nout, as soon as the greater part of them had crossed the trench, gave\r\nthe word of command to his men and charged the enemy. A desperate\r\nstruggle ensued; for the fight took place in a narrow space surrounded\r\nby walls; but at last the Romans were forced to turn and fly. Many of\r\nthem fell in the actual fighting, but the larger number were forced\r\nover the edge of the trench and were killed by the fall over its steep\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Further works of security.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ For the present Hannibal, after completing the palisade\r\nunmolested, was content to remain quiet, as his plan had succeeded to\r\nhis wish; for he had shut in the enemy and compelled them to remain\r\ninside their wall, in terror for the safety of the citadel as well\r\nas for their own; while he had raised the courage of the citizens of\r\nTarentum to such an extent, that they now imagined themselves to be a\r\nmatch for the Romans, even without the Carthaginians. A little later\r\nhe made at a short distance from the palisade, in the direction of the\r\ntown, a trench parallel to the palisade and the wall of the citadel;\r\nand the earth dug out from it having been piled up on the other side\r\nalong the edge nearest the town, he erected another palisade on the\r\ntop, thus making a fortification no less secure than the wall itself.\r\nOnce more, at a moderate distance, nearer the city, he commenced\r\nbuilding a wall, starting from the street called Soteira up to that\r\ncalled Batheia; so that, even without a garrison, the Tarentines were\r\nadequately protected by the mere constructions themselves. Then leaving\r\na sufficient garrison, and enough cavalry to serve on outpost duty for\r\nthe protection of the wall, he encamped along the bank of the river\r\nwhich is called by some the Galaesus, but by most people the Eurotas,\r\nafter the river which flows past Sparta. The Tarentines have many such\r\nderived names, both in town and country, from the acknowledged fact\r\nof their being a colony from Sparta and connected by blood with the\r\nLacedaemonians. As the wall quickly approached completion, owing to\r\nthe activity and zeal of the Tarentines, and the vigorous co-operation\r\nof the Carthaginians, Hannibal next conceived the idea of taking the\r\ncitadel also.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal’s arrangements for storming the citadel frustrated.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Romans reinforced.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New plans for cutting off the Roman supplies by sea.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 212-211.]\r\n\r\n+36.+ But when he had already completed the preparation of the\r\nnecessary engines for the assault, the Romans received some slight\r\nencouragement on a reinforcement throwing itself into the citadel\r\nby sea from Metapontium; and consequently they sallied out by night\r\nand attacked the works, and destroyed all Hannibal’s apparatus and\r\nengines. After this Hannibal abandoned the idea of a storm: but as the\r\nnew wall was now completed, he summoned a meeting of the Tarentines\r\nand pointed out to them that the most imperative necessity, in view\r\nof the present state of things, was to get command of the sea. For\r\nas the citadel commanded the entrance to the harbour, the Tarentines\r\ncould not use their ships nor sail out of it; while the Romans could\r\nget supplies conveyed to them by sea without danger: and as long as\r\nthat was the case, it was impossible that the city should have any\r\nsecurity for its freedom. Hannibal saw this clearly, and explained to\r\nthe Tarentines that, if the enemy on the citadel were deprived of hope\r\nof succour by sea, they would at once give way, and abandon it of their\r\nown accord, without attempting to defend the place. The Tarentines\r\nwere fully convinced by his words: but how it was to be brought about\r\nin the present state of affairs they could form no idea, unless a\r\nfleet should appear from Carthage; which at that time of the year was\r\nimpossible. They therefore said that they could not understand what\r\nHannibal was aiming at in these remarks to them. When he replied that\r\nit was plain that, even without the Carthaginians, they were all but in\r\ncommand of the sea, they were still more puzzled, and could not guess\r\nhis meaning. The truth was that Hannibal had noticed that the broad\r\nstreet, which was at once within the wall separating the town from the\r\ncitadel, and led from the harbour into the open sea, was well suited\r\nfor the purpose; and he had conceived the idea of dragging the ships\r\nout of the harbour to the sea on the southern side of the town. Upon\r\nhis disclosing his idea to the Tarentines, they not only expressed\r\ntheir agreement with the proposal, but the greatest admiration for\r\nhimself; and made up their minds that there was nothing which his\r\nacuteness and daring could not accomplish. Trucks on wheels were\r\nquickly constructed: and it was scarcely sooner said than done, owing\r\nto the zeal of the people and the numbers who helped to work at it. In\r\nthis way the Tarentines dragged their ships across into the open sea,\r\nand were enabled without danger to themselves to blockade the Romans\r\non the citadel, having deprived them of their supplies from without.\r\nBut Hannibal himself, leaving a garrison for the city, started with his\r\narmy, and returned in a three days’ march to his original camp; and\r\nthere remained without further movements for the rest of the winter....\r\n\r\nFALL OF SYRACUSE, B.C. 212\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The method taken by a Roman to estimate the height of the\r\nwall of Syracuse. Livy, 25, 23.] +37.+ He counted the layers; for as\r\nthe tower had been built of regular layers of stone, it was very easy\r\nto reckon the height of the battlements from the ground....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fall of Syracuse by an escalade, autumn B.C. 212. Livy, 24,\r\n23-31.]\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards on information being given by a deserter that\r\nthe Syracusans had been engaged in a public sacrifice to Artemis for\r\nthe last three days; and that they were using very scanty food in the\r\nfestival though plenty of wine, both Epicydes and certain Syracusans\r\nhaving given a large supply; Marcus Marcellus selected a part of the\r\nwall somewhat lower than the rest, and thinking it probable that the\r\nmen were drunk, owing to the license of the hour, and the short supply\r\nof food with their wine, he determined to attempt an escalade. Two\r\nladders of the proper height for the wall having been quickly made,\r\nhe pressed on the undertaking. He spoke openly to those who were fit\r\nto make the ascent and to face the first and most conspicuous risk,\r\nholding out to them brilliant prospects of reward. He also picked\r\nout some men to give them necessary help and bring ladders, without\r\ntelling them anything except to bid them be ready to obey orders.\r\nHis directions having been accurately obeyed, at the proper time in\r\nthe night he put the first men in motion, sending with them the men\r\nwith the ladders together with a maniple and a tribune, and having\r\nfirst reminded them of the rewards awaiting them if they behaved with\r\ngallantry. After this he got his whole force ready to start; and\r\ndespatching the vanguard by maniples at intervals, when a thousand had\r\nbeen massed in this way, after a short pause, he marched himself with\r\nthe main body. The men carrying the ladders having succeeded in safely\r\nplacing them against the wall, those who had been told off to make the\r\nascent mounted at once without hesitation. Having accomplished this\r\nwithout being observed, and having got a firm footing on the top of the\r\nwall, the rest began to mount by the ladders also, not in any fixed\r\norder, but as best they could. At first as they made their way upon the\r\nwall they found no one to oppose them, for the guards of the several\r\ntowers, owing to it being a time of public sacrifice, were either\r\nstill drinking or were gone to sleep again in a state of drunkenness.\r\nConsequently of the first and second companies of guards, which they\r\ncame upon, they killed the greater number before they knew that they\r\nwere being attacked. And when they came near Hexapyli, they descended\r\nfrom the wall, and forced open the first postern they came to which was\r\nlet into the wall, through which they admitted the general and the rest\r\nof the army. This is the way in which the Romans took Syracuse....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Livy, 25, 24.] None of the citizens knew what was happening\r\nbecause of the distance; for the town is a very large one....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first quarter occupied.

Nearly all other historians, or at\r\nany rate most, attract a variety of readers by entering upon all the\r\nvarious branches of history. The curious reader is attracted by the\r\ngenealogical style; the antiquarian by the discussion of colonisations,\r\norigins of cities, and ties of blood, such as is found in Ephorus; the\r\nstudent of polities by the story of tribes, cities, and dynasties. It\r\nis to this last branch of the subject that I have had a single eye, and\r\nhave devoted my whole work; and accordingly have, as I said before,\r\naccommodated all my plans to one particular class of narrative. The\r\nresult is that I have made my work by no means attractive reading to\r\nthe majority. Why I thus neglected other departments of history, and\r\ndeliberately resolved to confine myself to chronicling actions, I have\r\nalready stated at length; however, there is no reason why I should not\r\nbriefly remind my readers of it again in this place, for the sake of\r\nimpressing it upon them.\r\n\r\n+2.+ Seeing that many writers have discussed in many varieties of style\r\nthe question of genealogies, myths, and colonisations, as well as of\r\nthe foundations of cities and the consanguinity of peoples, there\r\nwas nothing left for a writer at this date but to copy the words of\r\nothers and claim them as his own,—than which nothing could be more\r\ndishonourable; or, if he did not choose to do that, to absolutely\r\nwaste his labour, being obliged to acknowledge that he is composing a\r\nhistory and bestowing thought on what has already been sufficiently set\r\nforth and transmitted to posterity by his predecessors. For these and\r\nsundry other reasons I abandoned such themes as these, and determined\r\non writing a history of actions: first, because they are continually\r\nnew and require a new narrative,—as of course one generation cannot\r\ngive us the history of the next; and secondly, because such a narrative\r\nis of all others the most instructive. This it has always been: but\r\nit is eminently so now, because the arts and sciences have made such\r\nan advance in our day, that students are able to arrange every event\r\nas it happens according to fixed rules, as it were, of scientific\r\nclassification. Therefore, as I did not aim so much at giving pleasure\r\nto my readers, as at profiting those who apply to such studies, I\r\nomitted all other themes and devoted myself wholly to this. But on\r\nthese points, those who give a careful attention to my narrative will\r\nbe the best witnesses to the truth of what I say....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANNIBALIAN WAR\r\n\r\n_In the previous year (212 B.C.) Syracuse had fallen: the two Scipios\r\nhad been conquered and killed in Spain: the siege-works had been\r\nconstructed round Capua, at the very time of the fall of Syracuse, i.e.\r\nin the autumn, Hannibal being engaged in fruitless attempts upon the\r\ncitadel of Tarentum. See Livy, 25, 22._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Q. Fulvius and Appius Claudius, the Consuls of the previous\r\nyear, were continued in command there, with orders not to leave the\r\nplace till it fell.

The Romans were still engaged in the siege of Capua.]\r\n\r\n+3.+ Entirely surrounding the position of Appius Claudius, Hannibal\r\nat first skirmished, and tried all he could to tempt him to come out\r\nand give him battle. But as no one attended to him, his attack became\r\nvery like an attempt to storm the camp; for his cavalry charged in\r\ntheir squadrons, and with loud cries hurled their javelins inside the\r\nentrenchments, and the infantry attacked in their regular companies,\r\nand tried to pull down the palisading round the camp. But not even\r\nso could he move the Romans from their purpose: they employed their\r\nlight-armed troops to repulse those who were actually attacking the\r\npalisade, but protecting themselves with their heavy shields against\r\nthe javelins of the enemy, they remained drawn up near their standards\r\nwithout moving. Discomfited at being neither able to throw himself into\r\nCapua, nor induce the Romans to leave their camp, Hannibal retired to\r\nconsult as to what was best to be done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The determination and cautious tactics of the Romans.]\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder, in my opinion, that the Carthaginians were puzzled. I\r\nthink any one who heard the facts would be the same. For who would not\r\nhave received with incredulity the statement that the Romans, after\r\nlosing so many battles to the Carthaginians, and though they did not\r\nventure to meet them on the field, could not nevertheless be induced\r\nto give up the contest or abandon the command of the country? Up to\r\nthis time, moreover, they had contented themselves with hovering in\r\nhis neighbourhood, keeping along the skirts of the mountains; but now\r\nthey had taken up a position on the plains, and those the fairest in\r\nall Italy, and were besieging the strongest city in it; and that with\r\nan enemy attacking them, whom they could not endure even the thought of\r\nmeeting face to face: while the Carthaginians, who beyond all dispute\r\nhad won the battles, were sometimes in as great difficulties as the\r\nlosers. I think the reason of the strategy adopted by the two sides\r\nrespectively was, that they both had seen that Hannibal’s cavalry\r\nwas the main cause of the Carthaginian victory and Roman defeat.\r\nAccordingly the plan of the losers after the battles, of following\r\ntheir enemies at a distance, was the natural one to adopt; for the\r\ncountry through which they went was such that the enemy’s cavalry would\r\nbe unable to do them any damage. Similarly what now happened at Capua\r\nto either side was natural and inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carthaginian difficulties.]\r\n\r\n+4.+ For the Roman army did not venture to come out and give battle,\r\nfrom fear of the enemy’s horse, but remained resolutely within their\r\nentrenchment; well knowing that the cavalry, by which they had\r\nbeen worsted in the battles, could not hurt them there. While the\r\nCarthaginians, again, naturally could not remain any longer encamped\r\nwith their cavalry, because all the pastures in the surrounding country\r\nhad been utterly destroyed by the Romans with that very view; and it\r\nwas impossible for animals to come from such a distance, carrying on\r\ntheir backs hay and barley for so large a body of cavalry, and so many\r\nbeasts of burden; nor again did they venture, when encamped without\r\ntheir cavalry, to attack an enemy protected by a palisade and fosse,\r\nwith whom a contest, even without these advantages in their favour, was\r\nlikely to be a doubtful one if they had not got their cavalry. Besides\r\nthis they were much alarmed about the new Consuls, lest they should\r\ncome and encamp against them, and reduce them to serious straits by\r\ncutting off their supplies of provisions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal determines on creating a diversion by threatening\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nThese considerations convinced Hannibal that it was impossible to raise\r\nthe siege by an open attack, and he therefore changed his tactics. He\r\nimagined that if by a secret march he could suddenly appear in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rome, he might by the alarm which he would inspire in\r\nthe inhabitants by his unexpected movement, perhaps do something worth\r\nwhile against the city itself; or, if he could not do that, would at\r\nleast force Appius either to raise the siege of Capua, in order to\r\nhasten to the relief of his native town, or to divide the Roman forces;\r\nwhich would then be easier for him to conquer in detail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal informs the Capuans of his purpose.]\r\n\r\n+5.+ With this purpose in his mind he sent a letter-carrier into\r\nCapua. This he did by persuading one of his Libyans to desert to the\r\nRoman camp, and thence to Capua. He took this trouble to secure the\r\nsafe delivery of his letter, because he was very much afraid that the\r\nCapuans, if they saw him departing, would consider that he despaired of\r\nthem, and would therefore give up hope and surrender to the Romans. He\r\nwrote therefore an explanation of his design, and sent the Libyan the\r\nday after, in order that the Capuans, being acquainted with the purpose\r\nof his departure, might go on courageously sustaining the siege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excitement and activity at Rome.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal starts.]\r\n\r\nWhen the news had arrived at Rome that Hannibal had encamped over\r\nagainst their lines, and was actually besieging their forces, there\r\nwas universal excitement and terror, from a feeling that the result of\r\nthe impending battle would decide the whole war. Consequently, with\r\none heart and soul, the citizens had all devoted themselves to sending\r\nout reinforcements and making preparations for this struggle. On their\r\npart, the Capuans were encouraged by the receipt of Hannibal’s letter,\r\nand by thus learning the object of the Carthaginian movement, to stand\r\nby their determination, and to await the issue of this new hope. At\r\nthe end of the fifth day, therefore, after his arrival on the ground,\r\nHannibal ordered his men to take their supper as usual, and leave their\r\nwatch-fires burning; and started with such secrecy, that none of the\r\nenemy knew what was happening. He took the road through Samnium, and\r\nmarched at a great pace and without stopping, his skirmishers always\r\nkeeping before him to reconnoitre and occupy all the posts along the\r\nroute: and while those in Rome had their thoughts still wholly occupied\r\nwith Capua and the campaign there, he crossed the Anio without being\r\nobserved; and having arrived at a distance of not more than forty\r\nstades from Rome, there pitched his camp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Terror at Rome.]\r\n\r\n+6.+ On this being known at Rome, the utmost confusion and terror\r\nprevailed among the inhabitants,—this movement of Hannibal’s being as\r\nunexpected as it was sudden; for he had never been so close to the\r\ncity before. At the same time their alarm was increased by the idea\r\nat once occurring to them, that he would not have ventured so near,\r\nif it were not that the armies at Capua were destroyed. Accordingly,\r\nthe men at once went to line the walls, and the points of vantage in\r\nthe defences of the town; while the women went round to the temples of\r\nthe gods and implored their protection, sweeping the pavements of the\r\ntemples with their hair: for this is their customary way of behaving\r\nwhen any serious danger comes upon their country. But just as Hannibal\r\nhad encamped, and was intending to attempt the city itself next day,\r\nan extraordinary coincidence occurred which proved fortunate for the\r\npreservation of Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Consular levies fortunately being at Rome enable the\r\nRomans to make a counter-demonstration.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal devastates the Campagna.]\r\n\r\nFor Gnaeus Fulvius and Publius Sulpicius, having already enrolled one\r\nconsular army, had bound the men with the usual oath to appear at Rome\r\narmed on that very day; and were also engaged on that day in drawing\r\nout the lists and testing the men for the other army:[325] whereby\r\nit so happened that a large number of men had been collected in Rome\r\nspontaneously in the very nick of time. These troops the Consuls boldly\r\nled outside the walls, and, entrenching themselves there, checked\r\nHannibal’s intended movement. For the Carthaginians were at first eager\r\nto advance, and were not altogether without hope that they would be\r\nable to take Rome itself by assault. But when they saw the enemy drawn\r\nup in order, and learnt before long from a prisoner what had happened,\r\nthey abandoned the idea of attacking the city, and began devastating\r\nthe country-side instead, and setting fire to the houses. In these\r\nfirst raids they collected an innumerable amount of booty, for the\r\nfield of plunder upon which they were entered was one into which no one\r\nhad ever expected an enemy to set foot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal starts on his return.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The passage of the Anio.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal turns upon his pursuers.]\r\n\r\n+7.+ But presently, when the Consuls ventured to encamp within ten\r\nstades of him, Hannibal broke up his quarters before daylight. He did\r\nso for three reasons:—first, because he had collected an enormous\r\nbooty; secondly, because he had given up all hope of taking Rome; and\r\nlastly, because he reckoned that the time had now come at which he\r\nexpected, according to his original idea, that Appius would have learnt\r\nthe danger threatening Rome, and would have raised the siege of Capua\r\nand come with his whole force to the relief of the city; or at any rate\r\nwould hurry up with the greater part, leaving a detachment to carry on\r\nthe siege. Publius had caused the bridges over the Anio to be broken\r\ndown, and thus compelled Hannibal to get his army across by a ford;\r\nand he now attacked the Carthaginians as they were engaged in making\r\nthe passage of the stream and caused them great distress. They were\r\nnot able however to strike an important blow, owing to the number of\r\nHannibal’s cavalry, and the activity of the Numidians in every part of\r\nthe field. But before retiring to their camp they wrested the greater\r\npart of the booty from them, and killed about three hundred men; and\r\nthen, being convinced that the Carthaginians were beating a hasty\r\nretreat in a panic, they followed in their rear, keeping along the\r\nline of hills. At first Hannibal continued to march at a rapid pace,\r\nbeing anxious to meet the force which he expected; but at the end of\r\nthe fifth day, being informed that Appius had not left the siege of\r\nCapua, he halted; and waiting for the enemy to come up, made an attack\r\nupon his camp before daylight, killed a large number of them, and drove\r\nthe rest out of their camp. But when day broke, and he saw the Romans\r\nin a strong position upon a steep hill, to which they had retired, he\r\ndecided not to continue his attack upon them; but marching through\r\nDaunia and Bruttium he appeared at Rhegium, so unexpectedly, that he\r\nwas within an ace of capturing the city, and did cut off all who were\r\nout in the country; and during this excursion captured a very large\r\nnumber of the Rhegini.\r\n\r\n+8.+ It seems to me that the courage and determination both of the\r\nCarthaginians and Romans at this crisis were truly remarkable; and\r\nmerit quite as much admiration as the conduct of Epaminondas, which I\r\nwill describe here for the sake of pointing the comparison.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rapid march of Epaminondas to Sparta, and back again to\r\nMantinea. See Xenophon, _Hell._ 7, 5, 8 _sq._ B.C. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Xenophon, _Hell._ 7, 5, 8 _sq._ B.C. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Cretan warns Agesilaus.]\r\n\r\nHe reached Tegea with the allies, and when he saw that the\r\nLacedaemonians with their own forces in full were come to Mantinea,\r\nand that their allies had mustered together in the same city, with the\r\nintention of offering the Thebans battle; having given orders to his\r\nmen to get their supper early, he led his army out immediately after\r\nnightfall, on the pretext of being anxious to seize certain posts with\r\na view to the coming battle. But having impressed this idea upon the\r\ncommon soldiers, he led them along the road to Lacedaemon itself; and\r\nhaving arrived at the city about the third hour of his march, contrary\r\nto all expectation, and finding Sparta destitute of defenders, he\r\nforced his way right up to the market-place, and occupied the quarters\r\nof the town which slope down to the river. Then however a contretemps\r\noccurred: a deserter made his way into Mantinea and told Agesilaus what\r\nwas going on. Assistance accordingly arrived just as the city was on\r\nthe point of being taken; and Epaminondas was disappointed of his hope.\r\nBut having caused his men to get their breakfast along the bank of the\r\nEurotas, and recovered them from their fatigue, he started to march\r\nback again by the same road, calculating that, as the Lacedaemonians\r\nand their allies had come to the relief of Sparta, Mantinea would in\r\nits turn be left undefended: which turned out to be the case. So he\r\nexhorted the Thebans to exert themselves; and, after a rapid night\r\nmarch, arrived at Mantinea about midday, finding it entirely destitute\r\nof defenders.\r\n\r\nBut the Athenians, who were at that time zealously supporting the\r\nLacedaemonians in their contest with the Thebans, had arrived in virtue\r\nof their treaty of alliance; and just as the Theban vanguard reached\r\nthe temple of Poseidon, seven stades from the town, it happened that\r\nthe Athenians showed themselves, by design, as if on the brow of the\r\nhill overhanging Mantinea. And when they saw them, the Mantineans who\r\nhad been left behind at last ventured to man the wall and resist the\r\nattack of the Thebans. Therefore historians are justified in speaking\r\nwith some dissatisfaction of these events,[326] when they say that\r\nthe leader did everything which a good general could, but that, while\r\nconquering his enemies, Epaminondas was conquered by Fortune.\r\n\r\n+9.+ Much the same remark applies to Hannibal. For who can refrain\r\nfrom regarding with respect and admiration a general capable of\r\ndoing what he did? First he attempted by harassing the enemy with\r\nskirmishing attacks to raise the siege: having failed in this he\r\nmade direct for Rome itself: baffled once more by a turn of fortune\r\nentirely independent of human calculation, he kept his pursuers in\r\nplay,[327] and waited till the moment was ripe to see whether the\r\nbesiegers of Capua stirred: and finally, without relaxing in his\r\ndetermination, swept down upon his enemies to their destruction, and\r\nall but depopulated Rhegium. One would be inclined however to judge the\r\nRomans to be superior to the Lacedaemonians at this crisis. For the\r\nLacedaemonians rushed off _en masse_ at the first message and relieved\r\nSparta, but, as far as they were concerned, lost Mantinea. The Romans\r\nguarded their own city without breaking up the siege of Capua: on the\r\ncontrary, they remained unshaken and firm in their purpose, and in fact\r\nfrom that time pressed the Capuans with renewed spirit.\r\n\r\nI have not said this for the sake of making a panegyric on either the\r\nRomans or Carthaginians, whose great qualities I have already remarked\r\nupon more than once: but for the sake of those who are in office among\r\nthe one or the other people, or who are in future times to direct\r\nthe affairs of any state whatever; that by the memory, or actual\r\ncontemplation, of exploits such as these they may be inspired with\r\nemulation. For in an adventurous and hazardous policy it often turns\r\nout that audacity was the truest safety and the finest sagacity;[328]\r\nand success or failure does not affect the credit and excellence of\r\nthe original design, so long as the measures taken are the result of\r\ndeliberate thought....\r\n\r\n\r\nTARENTUM\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Carthaginian fleet invited from Sicily to relieve\r\nTarentum does more harm than good, and departs to the joy of the\r\npeople, B.C. 211. Livy, 26, 20.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans were besieging Tarentum, Bomilcar the admiral of the\r\nCarthaginian fleet came to its relief with a very large force; and\r\nbeing unable to afford efficient aid to those in the town, owing to the\r\nstrict blockade maintained by the Romans, without meaning to do so he\r\nused up more than he brought; and so after having been constrained by\r\nentreaties and large promises to come, he was afterwards forced at the\r\nearnest supplication of the people to depart....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPOILS OF SYRACUSE\r\n\r\n+10.+ A city is not really adorned by what is brought from without, but\r\nby the virtue of its own inhabitants....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Syracuse was taken in the autumn, B.C. 212. “The ornaments\r\nof the city, statues and pictures were taken to Rome.” Livy, 25, 40,\r\ncp. 26, 21.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans, then, decided to transfer these things to their own city\r\nand to leave nothing behind. Whether they were right in doing so, and\r\nconsulted their true interests or the reverse, is a matter admitting\r\nof much discussion; but I think the balance of argument is in favour\r\nof believing it to have been wrong then, and wrong now. If such had\r\nbeen the works by which they had exalted their country, it is clear\r\nthat there would have been some reason in transferring thither the\r\nthings by which they had become great. But the fact was that, while\r\nleading lives of the greatest simplicity themselves, as far as possible\r\nremoved from the luxury and extravagance which these things imply, they\r\nyet conquered the men who had always possessed them in the greatest\r\nabundance and of the finest quality. Could there have been a greater\r\nmistake than theirs? Surely it would be an incontestable error for a\r\npeople to abandon the habits of the conquerors and adopt those of the\r\nconquered; and at the same time involve itself in that jealousy which\r\nis the most dangerous concomitant of excessive prosperity. For the\r\nlooker-on never congratulates those who take what belongs to others,\r\nwithout a feeling of jealousy mingling with his pity for the losers.\r\nBut suppose such prosperity to go on increasing, and a people to\r\naccumulate into its own hands all the possessions of the rest of the\r\nworld, and moreover to invite in a way the plundered to share in the\r\nspectacle they present, in that case surely the mischief is doubled.\r\nFor it is no longer a case of the spectators pitying their neighbours,\r\nbut themselves, as they recall the ruin of their own country. Such\r\na sight produces an outburst, not of jealousy merely, but of rage\r\nagainst the victors. For the reminder of their own disaster serves\r\nto enhance their hatred of the authors of it. To sweep the gold and\r\nsilver, however, into their own coffers was perhaps reasonable; for it\r\nwas impossible for them to aim at universal empire without crippling\r\nthe means of the rest of the world, and securing the same kind of\r\nresources for themselves. But they might have left in their original\r\nsites things that had nothing to do with material wealth; and thus at\r\nthe same time have avoided exciting jealousy, and raised the reputation\r\nof their country: adorning it, not with pictures and statues, but with\r\ndignity of character and greatness of soul. I have spoken thus much as\r\na warning to those who take upon themselves to rule over others, that\r\nthey may not imagine that, when they pillage cities, the misfortunes of\r\nothers are an honour to their own country. The Romans, however, when\r\nthey transferred these things to Rome, used such of them as belonged to\r\nindividuals to increase the splendour of private establishments, and\r\nsuch as belonged to the state to adorn the city....\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The two Scipios fall in B.C. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hasdrubal Gisconis tertius Carthaginiensium dux. Livy 24,\r\n41, cp. 25, 37.]\r\n\r\n+11.+ The leaders of the Carthaginians, though they had conquered their\r\nenemies, could not control themselves: and having made up their minds\r\nthat they had put an end to the Roman war, they began quarrelling\r\nwith each other, finding continual subjects of dispute through the\r\ninnate covetousness and ambition of the Phoenician character; among\r\nwhom Hasdrubal, son of Gesco, pushed his authority to such a pitch\r\nof iniquity as to demand a large sum of money from Andobales, the\r\nmost faithful of all their Iberian friends, who had some time before\r\nlost his chieftainship for the sake of the Carthaginians, and had but\r\nrecently recovered it through his loyalty to them. When Andobales,\r\ntrusting to his long fidelity to Carthage, refused this demand,\r\nHasdrubal got up a false charge against him and compelled him to give\r\nup his daughters as hostages....\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ART OF COMMANDING ARMIES\r\n\r\n+12.+ The chances and accidents that attend military expeditions\r\nrequire great circumspection; and it is possible to provide for all of\r\nthem with precision, provided that a man gives his mind to the conduct\r\nof his plan of campaign. Now that fewer operations in war are carried\r\nout openly and by mere force, than by stratagem and the skillful use of\r\nopportunity, any one that chooses may readily learn from the history\r\nof the past. And again that operations depending on the choice of\r\nopportunity oftener fail than succeed is easily proved from experience.\r\nNor can there be any doubt that the greater part of such failures are\r\ndue to the folly or carelessness of the leaders. It is time therefore\r\nto inquire into the rules of this art of strategy.\r\n\r\nSuch things as occur in campaigns without having been calculated upon\r\nin any way we must not speak of as operations, but as accidents or\r\ncasualties. It is the conduct of a campaign in accordance with an exact\r\nplan that I am to set forth: omitting all such things as do not fall\r\nunder a scientific rule, and have no fixed design.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The points of inherent importance in the conduct of a\r\ncampaign,—time, place, secrecy, code of signals, agents, and method.]\r\n\r\n+13.+ Every operation requires a time fixed for its commencement, a\r\nperiod and place for its execution, secrecy, definite signals, persons\r\nby whom and with whom it is to be executed, and a settled plan for\r\nconducting it. It is evident that the man who has rightly provided\r\nfor each of these details will not fail in the ultimate result, while\r\nhe who has neglected any single one of them will fail in the whole.\r\nSuch is the order of nature, that one insignificant circumstance will\r\nsuffice for failure, while for success rigid perfection of every detail\r\nis barely enough.\r\n\r\nLeaders then should neglect no single point in conducting such\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Things necessary. 1. Silence.]\r\n\r\nNow the head and front of such precautions is silence; and not to\r\nallow either joy at the appearance of an unexpected hope, or fear, or\r\nfamiliarity, or natural affection, to induce a man to communicate his\r\nplans to any one unconcerned, but to impart it to those and those alone\r\nwithout whom it is impossible to complete his plan, and not even to\r\nthem a moment sooner than necessary, but only when the exigencies of\r\nthe particular service make it inevitable. It is necessary, moreover,\r\nnot only to be silent with the tongue, but much more so in the mind.\r\nFor it has happened to many generals before now, while preserving an\r\ninviolable silence, to betray their thoughts either by the expression\r\nof their countenances or by their actions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Knowledge of the capabilities of the force in moving.]\r\n\r\nThe second requisite is to know accurately the conditions under which\r\nmarches by day or night may be performed, and the distances to which\r\nthey can extend, and not only marches on land, but also voyages by sea.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important is to have some knowledge of the seasons,\r\nand to be able to adapt the design to them.\r\n\r\nNor again is the selection of the ground for the operation to be\r\nregarded as unimportant, since it often happens that it is this\r\nwhich makes what seems impossible possible, and what seemed possible\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Care in concerting signals.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. Care in selecting men.]\r\n\r\nFinally there must be no neglect of the subject of signals and counter\r\nsignals; and the choice of persons by whom and with whom the operation\r\nis to be carried out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5. Knowledge of localities.]\r\n\r\n+14.+ Of these points some are learnt by experience, some from history,\r\nand others by the study of scientific strategy. It is a most excellent\r\nthing too that the general should have a personal knowledge both of\r\nthe roads, and the locality which he has to reach, and its natural\r\nfeatures, as well as of the persons by whom and with whom he is to act.\r\nIf that is not possible, the next best thing is that he should make\r\ncareful inquiries and not trust just any one: and men who undertake to\r\nact as guides to such places should always deposit security with those\r\nwhom they are conducting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 6. Accurate knowledge of natural phenomena enabling a\r\ngeneral to make accurate calculation of time.]\r\n\r\nThese, and other points like them, it is perhaps possible that leaders\r\nmay learn sufficiently from the mere study of strategy, whether\r\npractical or in books. But scientific investigation requires scientific\r\nprocesses and demonstrations, especially in astronomy and geometry; the\r\nworking out of which is not much to our present point, though their\r\nresults are important, and may contribute largely to the success of\r\nsuch undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe most important operation in astronomy is the calculation of the\r\nlengths of the days and nights. If these had been uniform it would not\r\nhave been a matter requiring any study, but the knowledge would have\r\nbeen common to all the world: since however they not only differ with\r\neach other but also with themselves, it is plainly necessary to be\r\nacquainted with the increase and diminution of both the one and the\r\nother. How can a man calculate a march, and the distance practicable in\r\na day or in a night, if he is unacquainted with the variation of these\r\nperiods of time? In fact nothing can be done up to time without this\r\nknowledge,—it is inevitable otherwise that a man should be sometimes\r\ntoo late and sometimes too soon. And these operations are the only ones\r\nin which being too soon is a worse fault than being too late. For the\r\ngeneral who overstays the proper hour of action only misses his chance,\r\nsince he can find out that he has done so before he arrives, and so\r\nget off safely: but he that anticipates the hour is detected when he\r\ncomes up; and so not only misses his immediate aim, but runs a risk of\r\nruining himself altogether.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The divisions of the day;]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: of the night.]\r\n\r\n+15.+ In all human undertakings opportuneness is the most important\r\nthing, but especially in operations of war. Therefore a general must\r\nhave at his fingers’ ends the season of the summer and winter solstice,\r\nthe equinoxes, and the periods between them in which the days and\r\nnights increase and diminish. For it is by this knowledge alone that\r\nhe can compute the distance that can be done whether by sea or land.\r\nAgain, he must necessarily understand the subdivisions both of the day\r\nand the night, in order to know at what hour to order the reveillé,\r\nor the march out; for the end cannot be attained unless the beginning\r\nbe rightly taken. As for the periods of the day, they may be observed\r\nby the shadows or by the sun’s course, and the quarter of the heaven\r\nin which it has arrived, but it is difficult to do the same for the\r\nnight, unless a man is familiar with the phenomenon of the twelve signs\r\nof the Zodiac, and their law and order: and this is easy to those\r\nwho have studied astronomy. For since, though the nights are unequal\r\nin length, at least six of the signs of the Zodiac are nevertheless\r\nabove the horizon every night, it is plain that in the same portions\r\nof every night equal portions of the twelve signs of the Zodiac rise.\r\nNow as it is known what portion of the sphere is occupied by the sun\r\nduring the day, it is evident that when he has set the arc subtended by\r\nthe diameter of his arc must rise. Therefore the length of the night\r\nis exactly commensurate with the portion of the Zodiac which appears\r\nabove the horizon after sunset. And, given that we know the number and\r\nsize of the signs of the Zodiac, the corresponding divisions of the\r\nnight are also known. If however the nights be cloudy, the moon must be\r\nwatched, since owing to its size its light as a general rule is always\r\nvisible, at whatsoever point in the heaven it may be. The hour may be\r\nguessed sometimes by observing the time and place of its rising, or\r\nagain of its setting, if you only have sufficient acquaintance with\r\nthis phenomenon to be familiar with the daily variation of its rising.\r\nAnd the law which it too follows admits of being easily observed; for\r\nits revolution is limited by the period of one month, which serves as a\r\nmodel to which all subsequent revolutions conform.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The example of Ulysses. See Odyss. 5, 270 _sq._]\r\n\r\n+16.+ And here one may mention with admiration that Homer represents\r\nUlysses, that truest type of a leader of men, taking observations of\r\nthe stars, not only to direct his voyages, but his operations on land\r\nalso. For such accidents as baffle expectation, and are incapable of\r\nbeing accurately reckoned upon, are quite sufficient to bring us to\r\ngreat and frequent distress, for instance, downpours of rain and rise\r\nof torrents, excessive frosts and snows, misty and cloudy weather, and\r\nother things like these;—but if we also neglect to provide for those\r\nwhich can be foreseen, is it not likely that we shall have ourselves\r\nto thank for frequent failures? None of these means then must be\r\nneglected, if we wish to avoid those errors into which many others are\r\nsaid to have fallen, as well as the particular generals whom I am about\r\nto mention by way of examples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aratus fails at Cynaetha.]\r\n\r\n+17.+ When Aratus, the Strategus of the Achaean league, attempted to\r\ntake Cynaetha by treachery, he arranged a day with those in the town\r\nwho were co-operating with him, on which he was to arrive on the banks\r\nof the river which flows past Cynaetha, and to remain there quietly\r\nwith his forces: while the party inside the town about midday, when\r\nthey got an opportunity, were to send out one of their men quietly,\r\nwrapped in a cloak, and order him to take his stand upon a tomb agreed\r\nupon in front of the city; the rest were to attack the officers who\r\nwere accustomed to guard the gate while taking their siesta. This\r\nbeing done, the Achaeans were to rise from their ambush and to make\r\nall haste to occupy the gate. These arrangements made, and the time\r\nhaving come, Aratus arrived; and having concealed himself down by the\r\nriver, waited there for the signal. But about an hour before noon, a\r\nman, whose profession it was to keep a fine kind of sheep near the\r\ntown, wishing to ask some business question of the shepherd, came out\r\nof the gate with his cloak on, and standing upon the same tomb looked\r\nround to find the shepherd. Whereupon Aratus, thinking that the signal\r\nhad been given, hurried with all his men as fast as he could towards\r\nthe gate. But the gate being hurriedly closed by the guard, owing to no\r\npreparations having yet been made by the party in the town, the result\r\nwas that Aratus not only failed in his attempt but was the cause of the\r\nworst misfortunes to his partisans. For being thus detected they were\r\ndragged forward and put to death. What is one to say was the cause of\r\nthis catastrophe? Surely that the general arranged only for a single\r\nsignal, and being then quite young had no experience of the accuracy\r\nsecured by double signals and counter-signals. On so small a point in\r\nwar does the success or failure of an operation turn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleomenes. See 2, 55.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: May 12.]\r\n\r\n+18.+ Again the Spartan Cleomenes, when proposing to take Megalopolis\r\nby a stratagem, arranged with the guards of that part of the wall\r\nnear what is called the Cavern to come out with all their men in the\r\nthird watch, the hour at which his partisans were on duty on the wall;\r\nbut not having taken into consideration the fact that at the time of\r\nthe rising of the Pleiads the nights are very short, he started his\r\narmy from Sparta about sunset. The result was that he was not able\r\nto get there in time, but being overtaken by daybreak, made a rash\r\nand ill-considered attempt to carry the town, and was repulsed with\r\nconsiderable loss and the danger of a complete overthrow. Now if he\r\nhad, in accordance with his arrangement, hit the proper time, and led\r\nin his men while his partisans were in command of the entrance, he\r\nwould not have failed in his attempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip’s attack on Meliteia. See 5, 97.]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, once more, King Philip, as I have already stated, when\r\ncarrying on an intrigue in the city of Meliteia, made a mistake in two\r\nways. The ladders which he brought were too short for their purpose,\r\nand he mistook the time. For having arranged to arrive about midnight,\r\nwhen every one was fast asleep, he started from Larissa and arrived in\r\nthe territory of Meliteia too early, and was neither able to halt, for\r\nfear of his arrival being announced in the city, nor to get back again\r\nwithout being discovered. Being compelled therefore to continue his\r\nadvance, he arrived at the city while the inhabitants were still awake.\r\nConsequently he could neither carry the wall by an escalade, because of\r\nthe insufficient length of the ladders; nor enter by the gate, because\r\nit was too early for his partisans inside to help him. Finally, he\r\ndid nothing but irritate the people of the town, and, after losing a\r\nconsiderable number of his own men, retired unsuccessful and covered\r\nwith disgrace; having only given a warning to the rest of the world to\r\ndistrust him and be on their guard against him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nicias, B.C. 413. Thucyd. 7, 50.]\r\n\r\n+19.+ Again Nicias, the general of the Athenians, had it in his power\r\nto have saved the army besieging Syracuse, and had selected the proper\r\ntime of the night for escaping the observation of the enemy, and\r\nretiring to a place of safety. And then because the moon was eclipsed,\r\nregarding it superstitiously as of evil portent, he stopped the army\r\nfrom starting. Thanks to this it came about that, when he started the\r\nnext day, the enemy had obtained information of his intention, and\r\narmy and generals alike fell into the hands of the Syracusans. Yet if\r\nhe had asked about this from men acquainted with such phenomena, he\r\nmight not only have avoided missing his opportunity for such an absurd\r\nreason, but have also used the occurrence for his own benefit owing\r\nto the ignorance of the enemy. For the ignorance of their neighbours\r\ncontributes more than anything else to the success of the instructed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The method of judging of the length necessary for scaling\r\nladders.]\r\n\r\nSuch then are examples of the necessity of studying celestial\r\nphenomena. But as for securing the proper length of scaling ladders,\r\nthe following is the method of making the calculation. Suppose the\r\nheight of the wall to be given by one of the conspirators within, the\r\nmeasurement required for the ladders is evident; for example, if the\r\nheight of the wall is ten feet or any other unit, the ladders must be\r\nfull twelve; and the interval between the wall and the foot of the\r\nladder must be half the length of the ladder, that the ladders may\r\nnot break under the weight of those mounting if they are set farther\r\naway, nor be too steep to be safe if set nearer the perpendicular. But\r\nsupposing it not to be possible to measure or get near the wall: the\r\nheight of any object which rises perpendicularly on its base can be\r\ntaken by those who choose to study mathematics.\r\n\r\n+20.+ Once more, therefore, those who wish to succeed in military\r\nprojects and operations must have studied geometry, not with\r\nprofessional completeness, but far enough to have a comprehension\r\nof proportion and equations. For it is not only in such cases that\r\nthese are necessary, but also for raising the scale of the divisions\r\nof a camp. For sometimes the problem is to change the entire form of\r\nthe camp, and yet to keep the same proportion between all the parts\r\nincluded: at other times to keep the same shape in the parts, and to\r\nincrease or diminish the whole area on which the camp stands, adding\r\nor subtracting from all proportionally. On which point I have already\r\nspoken in more elaborate detail in my Notes on Military Tactics. For\r\nI do not think that any one will reasonably object to me that I add a\r\ngreat burden to strategy, in urging on those who endeavour to acquire\r\nit the study of astronomy and geometry: for, while rather rejecting\r\nall that is superfluous in these studies, and brought in for show and\r\ntalk, as well as all idea of enjoining their prosecution beyond the\r\npoint of practical utility, I am most earnest and eager for so much\r\nas is barely necessary. For it would be strange if those who aim at\r\nthe sciences of dancing and flute-playing should study the preparatory\r\nsciences of rhythms and music, (and the like might be said of the\r\npursuits of the palaestra), from the belief that the final attainment\r\nof each of these sciences requires the assistance of the latter; while\r\nthe students of strategy are to feel aggrieved if they find that they\r\nrequire subsidiary sciences up to a certain point. That would mean that\r\nmen practising common and inferior arts are more diligent and energetic\r\nthan those who resolve to excel in the best and most dignified subject,\r\nwhich no man of sense would admit....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPUTATION OF THE SIZE OF CITIES\r\n\r\n+21.+ Most people calculate the area merely from the length of the\r\ncircumference [of towns or camps]. [Sidenote: Sparta and Megalopolis.]\r\nAccordingly, when one says that the city of Megalopolis has a circuit\r\nof fifty stades, and that of Sparta forty-eight, but that Sparta\r\nis twice the size of Megalopolis, they look upon the assertion as\r\nincredible. And if one, by way of increasing the difficulty, were\r\nto say that a city or camp may have a circuit of forty stades and\r\nyet be double the size of one having a perimeter of a hundred, the\r\nstatement would utterly puzzle them. The reason of this is that we do\r\nnot remember the lessons in geometry taught us at school. I was led to\r\nmake these remarks because it is not only common people, but actually\r\nsome statesmen and military commanders, who have puzzled themselves\r\nsometimes by wondering whether it were possible that Sparta should be\r\nbigger, and that too by a great deal, than Megalopolis, while having a\r\nshorter circuit; and at other times by trying to conjecture the number\r\nof men by considering the mere length of a camp’s circuit. A similar\r\nmistake is also made in pronouncing as to the number of the inhabitants\r\nof cities. For most people imagine that cities in which the ground is\r\nbroken and hilly contain more houses than a flat site. But the fact\r\nis not so; because houses are built at right angles not to sloping\r\nfoundations but to the plains below, upon which the hills themselves\r\nare excrescences. And this admits of a proof within the intelligence\r\nof a child. For if one would imagine houses on slopes to be raised\r\nuntil they were of the same height; it is evident that the plane of the\r\nroofs of the houses thus united will be equal and parallel to the plane\r\nunderlying the hills and foundations.\r\n\r\nSo much for those who aspire to be leaders and statesmen and are yet\r\nignorant and puzzled about such facts as these....\r\n\r\nThose who do not enter upon undertakings with good will and zeal cannot\r\nbe expected to give real help when the time comes to act....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HANNIBALIAN WAR, B.C. 211\r\n\r\nSuch being the position of the Romans and Carthaginians, Fortune\r\ncontinually oscillating between the two, we may say with the poet\r\n\r\n   “Pain hard by joy possessed the souls of each.”[329]...\r\n\r\nThere is profound truth in the observation which I have often made,\r\nthat it is impossible to grasp or get a complete view of the fairest of\r\nall subjects of contemplation, the tendency of history as a whole, from\r\nwriters of partial histories....\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF HANNIBAL\r\n\r\n+22.+ Of all that befell the Romans and Carthaginians, good or bad, the\r\ncause was one man and one mind,—Hannibal.\r\n\r\nFor it is notorious that he managed the Italian campaigns in person,\r\nand the Spanish by the agency of the elder of his brothers, Hasdrubal,\r\nand subsequently by that of Mago, the leaders who killed the two\r\nRoman generals in Spain about the same time. Again, he conducted the\r\nSicilian campaign at first through Hippocrates and afterwards through\r\nMyttonus[330] the Libyan. So also in Greece and Illyria: and, by\r\nbrandishing before their faces the dangers arising from these latter\r\nplaces, he was enabled to distract the attention of the Romans, thanks\r\nto his understanding with Philip. So great and wonderful is the\r\ninfluence of a Man, and a mind duly fitted by original constitution for\r\nany undertaking within the reach of human powers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ἀρχὴ ἄνδρα δείξει. Bias, in Aristot. Eth. 5, 1.]\r\n\r\nBut since the position of affairs has brought us to an inquiry into the\r\ngenius of Hannibal, the occasion seems to me to demand that I should\r\nexplain in regard to him the peculiarities of his character which have\r\nbeen especially the subject of controversy. Some regard him as having\r\nbeen extraordinarily cruel, some exceedingly grasping of money. But to\r\nspeak the truth of him, or of any person engaged in public affairs,\r\nis not easy. Some maintain that men’s real natures are brought out\r\nby their circumstances, and that they are detected when in office,\r\nor as some say when in misfortunes, though they have up to that time\r\ncompletely maintained their secrecy. I, on the contrary, do not regard\r\nthis as a sound dictum. For I think that men in these circumstances\r\nare compelled, not only occasionally but frequently, either by the\r\nsuggestions of friends or the complexity of affairs, to speak and act\r\ncontrary to their real principles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examples to the contrary. 1. Agathocles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 2. Cleomenes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. Athens.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 4. Sparta.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 5. Philip V.]\r\n\r\n+23.+ And there are many proofs of this to be found in past history\r\nif any one will give the necessary attention. Is it not universally\r\nstated by the historians that Agathocles, tyrant of Sicily, after\r\nhaving the reputation of extreme cruelty in his original measures for\r\nthe establishment of his dynasty, when he had once become convinced\r\nthat his power over the Siceliots was firmly established, is considered\r\nto have become the most humane and mild of rulers? Again, was not\r\nCleomenes of Sparta a most excellent king, a most cruel tyrant, and\r\nthen again as a private individual most obliging and benevolent? And\r\nyet it is not reasonable to suppose the most opposite dispositions\r\nto exist in the same nature. They are compelled to change with the\r\nchanges of circumstances: and so some rulers often display to the world\r\na disposition as opposite as possible to their true nature. Therefore\r\nthe natures of men not only are not brought out by such things, but\r\non the contrary are rather obscured. The same effect is produced also\r\nnot only in commanders, despots, and kings, but in states also, by\r\nthe suggestions of friends. For instance, you will find the Athenians\r\nresponsible for very few tyrannical acts, and of many kindly and noble\r\nones, while Aristeides and Pericles were at the head of the state:\r\nbut quite the reverse when Cleon and Chares were so. And when the\r\nLacedaemonians were supreme in Greece, all the measures taken by King\r\nCleombrotus were conceived in the interests of their allies, but those\r\nby Agesilaus not so. The characters of states therefore vary with\r\nthe variations of their leaders. King Philip again, when Taurion and\r\nDemetrius were acting with him, was most impious in his conduct, but\r\nwhen Aratus or Chrysogonus, most humane.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hannibal mastered by circumstances.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His cruelty.]\r\n\r\n+24.+ The case of Hannibal seems to me to be on a par with these. His\r\ncircumstances were so extraordinary and shifting, his closest friends\r\nso widely different, that it is exceedingly difficult to estimate his\r\ncharacter from his proceedings in Italy. What those circumstances\r\nsuggested to him may easily be understood from what I have already\r\nsaid, and what is immediately to follow; but it is not right to omit\r\nthe suggestions made by his friends either, especially as this matter\r\nmay be rendered sufficiently clear by one instance of the advice\r\noffered him. At the time that Hannibal was meditating the march from\r\nIberia to Italy with his army, he was confronted with the extreme\r\ndifficulty of providing food and securing provisions, both because\r\nthe journey was thought to be of insuperable length, and because the\r\nbarbarians that lived in the intervening country were so numerous and\r\nsavage. It appears that at that time this difficulty frequently came\r\non for discussion at the council; and that one of his friends, called\r\nHannibal Monomachus, gave it as his opinion that there was one and\r\nonly one way by which it was possible to get as far as Italy. Upon\r\nHannibal bidding him speak out, he said that they must teach the army\r\nto eat human flesh, and make them accustomed to it. Hannibal could\r\nsay nothing against the boldness and effectiveness of the idea, but\r\nwas unable to persuade himself or his friends to entertain it. It is\r\nthis man’s acts in Italy that they say were attributed to Hannibal, to\r\nmaintain the accusation of cruelty, as well as such as were the result\r\nof circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His avarice.]\r\n\r\n+25.+ Fond of money indeed he does seem to have been to a conspicuous\r\ndegree, and to have had a friend of the same character—Mago, who\r\ncommanded in Bruttium. That account I got from the Carthaginians\r\nthemselves; for natives know best not only which way the wind lies, as\r\nthe proverb has it, but the characters also of their fellow-countrymen.\r\nBut I heard a still more detailed story from Massanissa, who maintained\r\nthe charge of money-loving against all Carthaginians generally, but\r\nespecially against Hannibal and Mago called the Samnite. Among other\r\nstories, he told me that these two men had arranged a most generous\r\nsubdivision of operations between each other from their earliest\r\nyouth; and though they had each taken a very large number of cities in\r\nIberia and Italy by force or fraud, they had never taken part in the\r\nsame operation together; but had always schemed against each other,\r\nmore than against the enemy, in order to prevent the one being with\r\nthe other at the taking of a city: that they might neither quarrel in\r\nconsequence of things of this sort, nor have to divide the profit on\r\nthe ground of their equality of rank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of the fall of Capua, B.C. 211.]\r\n\r\n+26.+ The influence of friends then, and still more that of\r\ncircumstances, in doing violence to and changing the natural character\r\nof Hannibal, is shown by what I have narrated and will be shown by\r\nwhat I have to narrate. For as soon as Capua fell into the hands of\r\nthe Romans the other cities naturally became restless, and began to\r\nlook round for opportunities and pretexts for revolting back again to\r\nRome. It was then that Hannibal seems to have been at his lowest point\r\nof distress and despair. For neither was he able to keep a watch upon\r\nall the cities so widely removed from each other,—while he remained\r\nentrenched at one spot, and the enemy were manœuvering against him with\r\nseveral armies,—nor could he divide his force into many parts; for he\r\nwould have put an easy victory into the hands of the enemy by becoming\r\ninferior to them in numbers, and finding it impossible to be personally\r\npresent at all points. Wherefore he was obliged to completely abandon\r\nsome of the cities, and withdraw his garrisons from others: being\r\nafraid lest, in the course of the revolutions which might occur, he\r\nshould lose his own soldiers as well. Some cities again he made up his\r\nmind to treat with treacherous violence, removing their inhabitants to\r\nother cities, and giving their property up to plunder; in consequence\r\nof which many were enraged with him, and accused him of impiety or\r\ncruelty. For the fact was that these movements were accompanied by\r\nrobberies of money, murders, and violence, on various pretexts at the\r\nhands of the outgoing or incoming soldiers in the cities, because they\r\nalways supposed that the inhabitants that were left behind were on the\r\nverge of turning over to the enemy. It is, therefore, very difficult to\r\nexpress an opinion on the natural character of Hannibal, owing to the\r\ninfluence exercised on it by the counsel of friends and the force of\r\ncircumstances. The prevailing notion about him, however, at Carthage\r\nwas that he was greedy of money, at Rome that he was cruel.[331]...\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRIGENTUM\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agrigentum taken by Marcus Valerius Laevinus, late in the\r\nyear B.C. 210, _jam magna parte anni circumacta_. Livy, 26, 40.]\r\n\r\n+27.+ The city of Agrigentum is not only superior to most cities in the\r\nparticulars I have mentioned, but above all in beauty and elaborate\r\nornamentation. It stands within eighteen stades of the sea, so that it\r\nparticipates in every advantage from that quarter; while its circuit of\r\nfortification is particularly strong both by nature and art. For its\r\nwall is placed on a rock, steep and precipitous, on one side naturally,\r\non the other made so artificially. And it is enclosed by rivers: for\r\nalong the south side runs the river of the same name as the town, and\r\nalong the west and south-west side the river called Hypsas. The citadel\r\noverlooks the city exactly at the south-east, girt on the outside by\r\nan impassable ravine, and on the inside with only one approach from\r\nthe town. On the top of it is a temple of Athene and of Zeus Atabyrius\r\nas at Rhodes: for as Agrigentum was founded by the Rhodians, it is\r\nnatural that this deity should have the same appellation as at Rhodes.\r\nThe city is sumptuously adorned in other respects also with temples and\r\ncolonnades. The temple of Zeus Olympius is still unfinished, but in its\r\nplan and dimensions it seems to be inferior to no temple whatever in\r\nall Greece....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The treatment of the refugees and desperadoes who had\r\ncollected at Agathyrna in Sicily. See Livy, 26, 40 _fin._]\r\n\r\nMarcus Valerius persuaded these refugees, on giving them a pledge\r\nfor the security of their lives, to leave Sicily and go to Italy, on\r\ncondition that they should receive pay from the people of Rhegium\r\nfor plundering Bruttium, and retain all booty obtained from hostile\r\nterritory....\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE\r\n\r\n_Speech of Chlaeneas, the Aetolian, at Sparta. In the autumn of_ B.C.\r\n211 _the Consul-designate, M. Valerius Laevinus, induced the Aetolians,\r\nScopas being their Strategus, to form an alliance with them against\r\nPhilip. The treaty, as finally concluded, embraced also the Eleans,\r\nLacedaemonians, King Attalus of Pergamum, the Thracian King Pleuratus,\r\nand the Illyrian Scerdilaidas. A mission was sent from Aetolia to\r\npersuade the Lacedaemonians to join. See Livy, 26, 24._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 347.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Chaeronea, B.C. 338.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Succession of Alexander the Great, B.C. 336.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Destruction of Thebes, B.C. 335.]\r\n\r\n“That the Macedonian supremacy, men of Sparta, was the beginning of\r\nslavery to the Greeks, I am persuaded that no one will venture to deny;\r\nand you may satisfy yourselves by looking at it thus. There was a\r\nleague of Greeks living in the parts towards Thrace who were colonists\r\nfrom Athens and Chalcis, of which the most conspicuous and powerful was\r\nthe city of Olynthus. Having enslaved and made an example of this town,\r\nPhilip not only became master of the Thraceward cities, but reduced\r\nThessaly also to his authority by the terror which he had thus set up.\r\nNot long after this he conquered the Athenians in a pitched battle, and\r\nused his success with magnanimity, not from any wish to benefit the\r\nAthenians—far from it, but in order that his favourable treatment of\r\nthem might induce the other states to submit to him voluntarily. The\r\nreputation of your city was still such that it seemed likely, that, if\r\na proper opportunity arose, it would recover its supremacy in Greece.\r\nAccordingly, without waiting for any but the slightest pretext, Philip\r\ncame with his army and cut down everything standing in your fields, and\r\ndestroyed the houses with fire. And at last, after destroying towns and\r\nopen country alike, he assigned part of your territory to the Argives,\r\npart to Tegea and Megalopolis, and part to the Messenians: determined\r\nto benefit every people in spite of all justice, on the sole condition\r\nof their injuring you. Alexander succeeded Philip on the throne, and\r\nhow he destroyed Thebes, because he thought that it contained a spark\r\nof Hellenic life, however small, you all I think know well.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Battle of Crannon, ending the Lamian war, 7th Aug., B.C.\r\n322.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of Brennus at Delphi, B.C. 279. Pausan. 10, 15;\r\n20-23.]\r\n\r\n+29.+ “And why need I speak in detail of how the successors of this\r\nking have treated the Greeks? For surely there is no man living, so\r\nuninterested in public affairs, as not to have heard how Antipater in\r\nhis victory at Lamia treated the unhappy Athenians, as well as the\r\nother Greeks; and how he went so far in violence and brutality as to\r\ninstitute man-hunters, and send them to the various cities to catch all\r\nwho had ever spoken against, or in any way annoyed, the royal family\r\nof Macedonia: of whom some were dragged by force from the temples,\r\nand others from the very altars, and put to death with torture, and\r\nothers who escaped were forced to leave Greece entirely; nor had they\r\nany refuge save the Aetolian nation alone. For the Aetolians were\r\nthe only people in Greece who withstood Antipater in behalf of those\r\nunjustly defrauded of safety to their lives: they alone faced the\r\ninvasion of Brennus and his barbarian army: and they alone came to your\r\naid when called upon, with a determination to assist you in regaining\r\nyour ancestral supremacy in Greece.[332] Who again is ignorant of the\r\ndeeds of Cassander, Demetrius, and Antigonus Gonatas? For owing to\r\ntheir recency the knowledge of them still remains distinct. Some of\r\nthem by introducing garrisons, and others by implanting despots in the\r\ncities, effectually secured that every state should share the infamous\r\nbrand of slavery. But passing by all these I will now come to the last\r\nAntigonus,[333] lest any of you, viewing his policy unsuspiciously,\r\nshould consider that you are under an obligation to the Macedonians.\r\nFor it was with no purpose of saving the Achaeans that he undertook\r\nthe war against you, nor from any dislike of the tyranny of Cleomenes\r\ninducing him to free the Lacedaemonians. If any man among you holds\r\nthis opinion, he must be simple indeed. No! It was because he saw\r\nthat his own power would not be secure if you got the rule of the\r\nPeloponnese; and because he saw that Cleomenes was of a nature well\r\ncalculated to secure this object, and that fortune was splendidly\r\nseconding your efforts, that he came in a tumult of fear and jealousy,\r\nnot to help Peloponnesians, but to destroy your hopes and abase your\r\npower. Therefore you do not owe the Macedonians so much gratitude for\r\nnot destroying your city when they had taken it, as hostility and\r\nhatred, for having more than once already stood in your way, when you\r\nwere strong enough to grasp the supremacy of Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip V.]\r\n\r\n+30.+ “Again, what need to speak more on the wickedness of Philip? For\r\nof his impiety towards the gods his outrages on the temples at Thermus\r\nare a sufficient proof; and of his cruelty towards man, his perfidy and\r\ntreachery to the Messenians.\r\n\r\n“So much for the past. But as to the present resolution before you, it\r\nis in a way necessary to draft it, and vote on it, as though you were\r\ndeciding on war, and yet in real truth not to regard it as a war. For\r\nit is impossible for the Achaeans, beaten as they are, to damage your\r\nterritory: but I imagine that they will be only too thankful to heaven\r\nif they can but protect their own, when they find themselves surrounded\r\nby war with Eleans and Messenians as allied to us, and with ourselves\r\nat the same time. And Philip, I am persuaded, will soon desist from his\r\nattack, when involved in a war by land with Aetolians, and by sea with\r\nRome and King Attalus. The future may be easily conjectured from the\r\npast. For if he always failed to subdue Aetolians when they were his\r\nonly enemies, can we conceive that he will be able to support the war\r\nif all these combine?\r\n\r\n+31.+ “I have said thus much with the deliberate purpose of showing you\r\nthat you are not hampered by previous engagements, but are entirely\r\nfree in your deliberations as to which you ought to join—Aetolians or\r\nMacedonians. If you are under an earlier engagement, and have already\r\nmade up your minds on these points, what room is there for further\r\nargument? For if you had made the alliance now existing between\r\nyourselves and us, previous to the good services done you by Antigonus,\r\nthere might perhaps have been some reason for questioning whether it\r\nwere right to neglect an old treaty in gratitude for recent favours.\r\nBut since it was subsequent to this much vaunted freedom and security\r\ngiven you by Antigonus, and with which they are perpetually taunting\r\nyou, that, after deliberation and frequent consideration as to which of\r\nthe two you ought to join, you decided to combine with us Aetolians;\r\nand have actually exchanged pledges of fidelity with us, and have\r\nfought by our side in the late war against Macedonia, how can any one\r\nentertain a doubt on the subject any longer? For the obligations of\r\nkindness between you and Antigonus and Philip were cancelled then. It\r\nnow remains for you to point out some subsequent wrong done you by\r\nAetolians, or subsequent favour by Macedonians: or if neither of these\r\nexist, on what grounds are you now, at the instance of the very men to\r\nwhom you justly refused to listen formerly, when no obligation existed,\r\nabout to undo treaties and oaths—the strongest bonds of fidelity\r\nexisting among mankind.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion of what was considered a very cogent speech by\r\nChlaeneas.\r\n\r\n+32.+ After him the ambassador of the Acarnanians, Lyciscus, came\r\nforward: and at first he paused, seeing the multitude talking to each\r\nother about the last speech; but when at last silence was obtained, he\r\nbegan his speech as follows:—\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Speech of Lyciscus, envoy from Acarnania, which country was\r\nto fall to the Aetolians by the proposed new treaty. See Livy, 26, 24.]\r\n\r\n“I and my colleagues, men of Sparta, have been sent to you by the\r\ncommon league of the Acarnanians; and as we have always shared in\r\nthe same prospects as the Macedonians, we consider that this mission\r\nalso is common to us and them. For just as on the field of war, owing\r\nto the superiority and magnitude of the Macedonian force, our safety\r\nis involved in their valour; so, in the controversies of diplomacy,\r\nour interests are inseparable from the rights of the Macedonians.\r\nNow Chlaeneas in the peroration of his address gave a summary of the\r\nobligations existing between the Aetolians and yourselves. For he said,\r\n'If subsequent to your making the alliance with them any fresh injury\r\nor offence had been committed by Aetolians, or any kindness done by\r\nMacedonians, the present proposal ought properly to be discussed as\r\na fresh start; but that if, nothing of the sort having taken place,\r\nwe believe that by quoting the services of Antigonus, and your former\r\ndecrees, we shall be able to annul existing oaths and treaties, we are\r\nthe greatest simpletons in the world.’ To this I reply by acknowledging\r\nthat I must indeed be the most foolish of men, and that the arguments\r\nI am about to put forward are indeed futile, if, as he maintains,\r\nnothing fresh has happened, and Greek affairs are in precisely the same\r\nposition as before. But if exactly the reverse be the case, as I shall\r\nclearly prove in the course of my speech,—then I imagine that I shall\r\nbe shown to give you some salutary advice, and Chlaeneas to be quite in\r\nthe wrong. We are come, then, expressly because we are convinced that\r\nit is needful for us to speak on this very point: namely, to point out\r\nto you that it is at once your duty and your interest, after hearing of\r\nthe evils threatening Greece, to adopt if possible a policy excellent\r\nand worthy of yourselves by uniting your prospects with ours; or if\r\nthat cannot be, at least to abstain from this movement for the present.\r\n\r\n+33.+ “But since the last speaker has ventured to go back to ancient\r\ntimes for his denunciations of the Macedonian royal family, I feel\r\nit incumbent on me also to say a few words first on these points, to\r\nremove the misconception of those who have been carried away by his\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sacred war, B.C. 357-346. Onomarchus killed near the gulf of\r\nPagasae, B.C. 352. See Diodor. 16, 32-35.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Philip elected generalissimo against Persia in the congress\r\nof allies at Corinth, B.C. 338.]\r\n\r\n“Chlaenaes said, then, that Philip son of Amyntas became master of\r\nThessaly by the ruin of Olynthus. But I conceive that not only the\r\nThessalians, but the other Greeks also, were preserved by Philip’s\r\nmeans. For at the time when Onomarchus and Philomelus, in defiance\r\nof religion and law seized Delphi and made themselves masters of the\r\ntreasury of the god, who is there among you who does not know that\r\nthey collected such a mighty force as no Greek dared any longer face?\r\nNay, along with this violation of religion, they were within an ace of\r\nbecoming lords of all Greece also. At that crisis Philip volunteered\r\nhis assistance; destroyed the tyrants, secured the temple, and became\r\nthe author of freedom to the Greeks, as is testified even to posterity\r\nby the facts. For Philip was unanimously elected general-in-chief\r\nby land and sea, not, as my opponent ventured to assert, as one who\r\nhad wronged Thessaly; but on the ground of his being a benefactor of\r\nGreece: an honour which no one had previously obtained. 'Ay, but,’ he\r\nsays, 'Philip came with an armed force into Laconia.' Yes, but it was\r\nnot of his own choice, as you know: he reluctantly consented to do so,\r\nafter repeated invitations and appeals by the Peloponnesians, under\r\nthe name of their friend and ally. And when he did come, pray observe,\r\nChlaeneas, how he behaved. Though he could have availed himself of\r\nthe wishes of the neighbouring states for the destruction of these\r\nmen’s territory and the humiliation of their city, and have won much\r\ngratitude too by his act, he by no means lent himself to such a policy;\r\nbut, by striking terror into the one and the other alike, he compelled\r\nboth parties to accommodate their differences in a congress, to the\r\ncommon benefit of all: not putting himself forward as arbitrator of the\r\npoints in dispute, but appointing a joint board of arbitration selected\r\nfrom all Greece. Is that a proceeding which deserves to be held up to\r\nreproach and execration?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alexander’s services to Greece.]\r\n\r\n+34.+ “Again, you bitterly denounced Alexander, because, when he\r\nbelieved himself to be wronged, he punished Thebes: but of his having\r\nexacted vengeance of the Persians for their outrages on all the Greeks\r\nyou made no mention at all, nor of his having released us all in common\r\nfrom heavy miseries, by enslaving the barbarians, and depriving them\r\nof the supplies which they used for the ruin of the Greeks,—sometimes\r\npitting the Athenians against the ancestors of these gentlemen here, at\r\nanother the Thebans; nor finally of his having subjected Asia to the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Diadochi.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Aetolian policy.]\r\n\r\n“As for Alexander’s successors how had you the audacity to mention\r\nthem? They were indeed, according to the circumstances of the time, on\r\nmany occasions the authors of good to some and of harm to others: for\r\nwhich perhaps others might be allowed to bear them a grudge. But to\r\n_you_ Aetolians it is in no circumstance open to do so,—you who have\r\nnever been the authors of anything good to any one, but of mischief\r\nto many and on many occasions! Who was it that called in Antigonus\r\nson of Demetrius to the partition of the Achaean league? Who was it\r\nthat made a sworn treaty with Alexander of Epirus for the enslaving\r\nand dismembering of Acarnania? Was it not you? What nation ever sent\r\nout military commanders duly accredited of the sort that you have? Men\r\nthat ventured to do violence to the sanctity of asylum itself! Timaeus\r\nviolated the sanctuary of Poseidon on Taenarum, and of Artemis at Lusi.\r\nPharylus and Polycritus plundered, the former the sacred enclosure of\r\nHere in Argos, the latter that of Poseidon at Mantinea. What again\r\nabout Lattabus and Nicostratus? Did not they make a treacherous attack\r\non the assembly of the Pan-boeotians in time of peace, committing\r\noutrages worthy of Scythians and Gauls? You will find no such crimes as\r\nthese committed by the Diadochi.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 279.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat and death of Ptolemy Ceraunus in the battle with the\r\nGauls, B.C. 280. See Pausan. 10, 19, 7.]\r\n\r\n+35.+ “Not being able to say anything in defence of any of these acts,\r\nyou talk pompously about your having resisted the invasion of Delphi by\r\nthe barbarians, and allege that for this Greece ought to be grateful\r\nto you. But if for this one service some gratitude is owing to the\r\nAetolians; what high honour do the Macedonians deserve, who throughout\r\nnearly their whole lives are ceaselessly engaged in a struggle with\r\nthe barbarians for the safety of the Greeks? For that Greece would\r\nhave been continually involved in great dangers, if we had not had\r\nthe Macedonians and the ambition of their kings as a barrier, who is\r\nignorant? And there is a very striking proof of this. For no sooner had\r\nthe Gauls conceived a contempt for the Macedonians, by their victory\r\nover Ptolemy Ceraunus, than, thinking the rest of no account, Brennus\r\npromptly marched into the middle of Greece. And this would often have\r\nhappened if the Macedonians had not been on our frontiers.\r\n\r\n“However, though I have much that I could say on the past, I think\r\nthis is enough. Of all the actions of Philip, they have selected his\r\ndestruction of the temple, to fasten the charge of impiety upon him.\r\nThey did not add a word about their own outrage and crime, which\r\nthey perpetrated in regard to the temples in Dium, and Dodona, and\r\nthe sacred enclosures of the gods. The speaker should have mentioned\r\nthis first. But anything you Aetolians have suffered you recount to\r\nthese gentlemen with exaggeration: but the things you have inflicted\r\nunprovoked, though many times as numerous as the others, you pass over\r\nin silence; because you know full well that everybody lays the blame\r\nof acts of injustice and mischief on those who give the provocation by\r\nunjust actions themselves.\r\n\r\n+36.+ “Of Antigonus I will only make mention so far, as to avoid\r\nappearing to despise what was done, or to treat as unimportant so great\r\nan undertaking. For my part I think that history does not contain the\r\nrecord of a more admirable service than that which Antigonus performed\r\nfor you: indeed it appears to me to be unsurpassable. And the following\r\nfacts will show this. Antigonus went to war with you and conquered\r\nyou in a pitched battle. By force of arms he became master of your\r\nterritory and city at once. He might have exercised all the rights of\r\nwar upon you: but he was so far from inflicting any hardships upon you,\r\nthat, besides other benefits, he expelled your tyrant and restored your\r\nlaws and ancestral constitution. In return for which, in the national\r\nassemblies, calling the Greeks to witness your words, you proclaimed\r\nAntigonus your benefactor and preserver.\r\n\r\n“What then ought to have been your policy? I will speak what I really\r\nthink, gentlemen of Sparta: and you will I am sure bear with me. For\r\nI shall do this now from no wish to go out of my way to bring railing\r\naccusations against you, but under the pressure of circumstances, and\r\nfor the common good. What then am I to say? This: that both in the late\r\nwar you ought to have allied yourselves not with Aetolians but with\r\nMacedonians; and now again, in answer to these invitations, you ought\r\nto join Philip rather than the former people. But, it may be objected,\r\nyou will be breaking a treaty. Which will be the graver breach of right\r\non your part,—to neglect a private arrangement made with Aetolians, or\r\none that has been inscribed on a column and solemnly consecrated in\r\nthe sight of all Greece? On what ground are you so careful of breaking\r\nfaith with this people, from whom you have never received any favour,\r\nwhile you pay no heed to Philip and the Macedonians, to whom you owe\r\neven the very power of deliberating to-day? Do you regard it as a duty\r\nto keep faith with friends? Yet it is not so much a point of conscience\r\nto confirm written pledges of faith, as it is a violation of conscience\r\nto go to war with those who preserved you: and this is what, in the\r\npresent instance, the Aetolians are come to demand of you.\r\n\r\n+37.+ “Let it, however, be granted that what I have now said may in\r\nthe eyes of severe critics be regarded as beside the subject. I will\r\nnow return to the main point at issue, as they state it. It was this:\r\n'If the circumstances are the same now as at the time when you made\r\nalliance with the Aetolians, then your policy ought to remain on the\r\nsame lines.’ That was their first proposition. 'But if they have been\r\nentirely changed, then it is fair that you should now deliberate on the\r\ndemands made to you as on a matter entirely new and unprejudiced.' I\r\nask you therefore, Cleonicus and Chlaeneas, who were your allies on the\r\nformer occasion when you invited this people to join you? Were they not\r\nall the Greeks? But with whom are you now united, or to what kind of\r\nfederation are you now inviting this people? Is it not to one with the\r\nforeigner? A mighty similarity exists, no doubt, in your minds, and no\r\ndiversity at all! _Then_ you were contending for glory and supremacy\r\nwith Achaeans and Macedonians, men of kindred blood with yourselves,\r\nand with Philip their leader; _now_ a war of slavery is threatening\r\nGreece against men of another race, whom you think to bring against\r\nPhilip, but have really unconsciously brought against yourselves and\r\nall Greece. For just as men in the stress of war, by introducing into\r\ntheir cities garrisons superior in strength to their own forces, while\r\nsuccessfully repelling all danger from the enemy, put themselves at the\r\nmercy of their friends,—just so are the Aetolians acting in the present\r\ncase. For in their desire to conquer Philip and humble Macedonia, they\r\nhave unconsciously brought such a mighty cloud from the west, as for\r\nthe present perhaps will overshadow Macedonia first, but which in the\r\nsequel will be the origin of heavy evils to all Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 492. Herod. 6, 48; 7, 133.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 480]\r\n\r\n+38.+ “All Greeks indeed have need to be on the alert for the crisis\r\nwhich is coming on: but Lacedaemonians above all. For why was it, do\r\nyou suppose, men of Sparta, that your ancestors, when Xerxes sent an\r\nambassador to your town demanding earth and water, thrust the man into\r\na well, and, throwing earth upon him, bade him take back word to Xerxes\r\nthat he had got from the Lacedaemonians what he had demanded from\r\nthem,—earth and water? Why was it again, do you suppose, that Leonidas\r\nand his men started forth to a voluntary and certain death? Was it not\r\nthat they might have the glory of being the forlorn hope, not only of\r\ntheir own freedom, but of that of all Greece also? And it would indeed\r\nbe a worthy action for descendants of such heroes as these to make a\r\nleague with the barbarians now, and to serve with them; and to war\r\nagainst Epirotes, Achaeans, Acarnanians, Boeotians, Thessalians, and in\r\nfact against nearly every Greek state except Aetolians! To these last\r\nit is habitual to act thus: and to regard nothing as disgraceful, so\r\nlong only as it is accompanied by an opportunity of plunder. It is not\r\nso, however, with you. And what must we expect these people to do, now\r\nthat they have obtained the support of the Roman alliance? For when\r\nthey obtained an accession of strength and support from the Illyrians,\r\nthey at once set about acts of piracy at sea, and treacherously seized\r\nPylus; while by land they stormed the city of Cleitor, and sold the\r\nCynethans into slavery. Once before they made a treaty with Antigonus,\r\nas I said just now, for the destruction of the Achaean and Acarnanian\r\nraces; and now they have done the same with Rome for the destruction of\r\nall Greece.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Herod. 7, 132.]\r\n\r\n+39.+ “With a knowledge of such transactions before his eyes who could\r\nhelp suspecting an attack from Rome, and feeling abhorrence at the\r\nabandoned conduct of the Aetolians in daring to make such a treaty?\r\nThey have already wrested Oeniadae and Nesus from the Acarnanians,\r\nand recently seized the city of the unfortunate Anticyreans, whom, in\r\nconjunction with the Romans, they have sold into slavery.[334] Their\r\nchildren and women are led off by the Romans to suffer all the miseries\r\nwhich those must expect who fall into the hands of aliens; while the\r\nhouses of the unhappy inhabitants are allotted among the Aetolians.\r\nSurely a noble alliance this to join deliberately! Especially for\r\nLacedaemonians: who, after conquering the barbarians, decreed that the\r\nThebans, for being the only Greeks that resolved to remain neutral\r\nduring the Persian invasion, should pay a tenth of their goods to the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\n“The honourable course then, men of Sparta, and the one becoming your\r\ncharacter, is to remember from what ancestors you are sprung; to be\r\non your guard against an attack from Rome; to suspect the treachery\r\nof the Aetolians. Above all to recall the services of Antigonus: and\r\nso once more show your loathing for dishonest men; and, rejecting the\r\nfriendship of the Aetolians, unite your hopes for the future with those\r\nof Achaia and Macedonia. If, however, any of your own influential\r\ncitizens are intriguing against this policy, then at least remain\r\nneutral, and do not take part in the iniquities of these Aetolians....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_In the autumn of B.C. 211, Philip being in Thrace, Scopas made a\r\nlevy of Aetolians to invade Acarnania.

And when the plan was complete, the\r\nappearance of the works was very like the style of the wall. For the\r\nsuper-structures on the pent-houses had the appearance and style of\r\ntowers, owing to the placing of the wattles side by side; and the space\r\nbetween looked like a wall, because the row of wattles at the top of\r\nthe covered way were divided into battlements by the fashion in which\r\nthey were woven. In the lowest division of these besieging towers the\r\ndiggers employed in levelling inequalities, to allow the stands of the\r\nbattering-rams to be brought up, kept throwing on earth, and the ram\r\nwas propelled forward: in the second story were water vessels and other\r\nappliances for quenching fires, and along with them the catapults: and\r\non the third a considerable body of men were placed to fight with all\r\nwho tried to damage the rams; and they were on a level with the city\r\ntowers. From the covered way between the besieging towers a double\r\ntrench was to be dug towards the wall, between the city towers. There\r\nwere also three batteries for stone-throwing machines, one of which\r\ncarried stones of a talent weight, and the other two half that weight.\r\nFrom the camp to the pent-houses and diggers’ sheds underground tunnels\r\nhad been constructed, to prevent men, going to the works from the camp\r\nor returning from the works, being wounded in any way by missiles from\r\nthe town. These works were completed in a very few days, because the\r\ndistrict round produced what was wanted for this service in abundance.\r\nFor Echinus is situated on the Melian Gulf, facing south, exactly\r\nopposite the territory of Thronium, and enjoys a soil rich in every\r\nkind of produce; thanks to which circumstance Philip had no scarcity of\r\nanything he required for his purpose. Accordingly, as I said, as soon\r\nas the works were completed, they begun at once pushing the trenches\r\nand the siege machinery towards the walls....\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Spring of B.C. 209.[336]\r\n\r\n+42.+ While Philip was investing Echinus, and had secured his position\r\nexcellently on the side of the town, and had strengthened the outer\r\nline of his camp with a trench and wall, Publius Sulpicius, the Roman\r\nproconsul, ] and Dorimachus, Strategus of the Aetolians, arrived in\r\nperson,—Publius with a fleet, and Dorimachus with an army of infantry\r\nand cavalry,—and assaulted Philip’s entrenchment. Their repulse led to\r\ngreater exertions on Philip’s part in his attack upon the Echinaeans,\r\nwho in despair surrendered to him.

Publius at first returned a harsh answer, saying, that “When\r\nthey were their own masters was the time that they ought to have sent\r\nambassadors to their betters to ask for mercy, not now when they were\r\nslaves. A little while ago they had not thought an ambassador from him\r\nworthy of even a word; now that they were captives they expected to\r\nbe allowed to send ambassadors to their kinsfolk: was that not sheer\r\nfolly?” So at the time he dismissed those who came to him with these\r\nwords. But next morning he called all the captives together and said\r\nthat, as to the Aeginetans, he owed them no favour; but for the sake of\r\nthe rest of the Greeks he would allow them to send ambassadors to get\r\nransom, since that was the custom of their country....\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: July 26.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The transport of the army of Antiochus in his eastern\r\ncampaigns.

It seems to discharge itself into the\r\nRed Sea; but in point of fact it does not do so: for its waters are\r\ndissipated among the ditches dug across the fields before it reaches\r\nthe sea. Accordingly the nature of this river is the reverse of that\r\nof others. For in other rivers the volume of water is increased in\r\nproportion to the greater distance traversed, and they are at their\r\nhighest in winter and lowest in midsummer; but this river is fullest\r\nof water at the rising of the dog-star, and has the largest volume\r\nof water in Syria, which continually decreases as it advances. The\r\nreason of this is that the increase is not caused by the collection\r\nof winter rains, but by the melting of the snows; and its decrease by\r\nthe diversion of its stream into the land, and its subdivision for the\r\npurposes of irrigation. It was this which on this occasion made the\r\ntransport of the army slow, because as the boats were heavily laden,\r\nand the stream very low, the forces of the current did exceedingly\r\nlittle to help them down.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBASSY FROM ROME TO PTOLEMY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: M.

In fact the scarcity at Rome had\r\ncome to such a pitch, that a Sicilian medimnus was sold for fifteen\r\ndrachmae.[337] But in spite of this distress the Romans did not relax\r\nin their attention to the war.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

The only\r\nfairly good one was a German translation.\r\n\r\n[3] Unless the avoidance of the hiatus be counted one, which has\r\nbeen pointed out by Hultsch. I cannot forbear from quoting here the\r\nadmirable words of Casaubon on the style of Polybius:—_Non deest sed\r\nnon eminet in Polybio facundia.

One of the common grounds of offence\r\nhad long been the refusal of Philopoemen and other Strategi to summon\r\nan assembly to meet a Roman officer unless he came duly authorised\r\nwith a definite communication from the Senate. On this ground\r\nQuintus Caecilius was refused in B.C. 185 (Polyb. 23, 19) and also\r\nTitus Flamininus in B.C. 183 (Polyb. 24, 5). See Freeman’s _Federal\r\nGovernment_, pp. 652-655. And no doubt other cases of a similar nature\r\nwould occur, generally leading to an unfavourable report at Rome.\r\n\r\n[26] Polyb. 30, 13.

Plutarch, _Lys._ 30. Lucian,\r\n_Quomodo hist. conscr._ § 59.\r\n\r\n[95] The History of the Achaean league is given with unrivalled\r\nlearning, clearness, and impartiality by Bishop Thirlwall in the eighth\r\nvolume of his _History of Greece_. Its constitution has been discussed\r\nwith great fulness by Professor E. A. Freeman in his _History of\r\nFederal Government_. Recently Mr. Capes has published an edition of the\r\nparts of Polybius referring to it which will be found useful; and Mr.\r\nStrachan-Davidson has an able essay upon it in his edition of Extracts\r\nfrom Polybius. Still some brief statement of the main features of this\r\nremarkable attempt to construct a durable Hellenic Federation could not\r\nbe altogether omitted here.\r\n\r\n[96] Take for instance the oath of the Pylagorae (Aeschin. _de Fal.\r\nL._ 121): “We will destroy no city of the Amphictyony, nor cut off its\r\nstreams in peace or war; if any shall do so, we will march against him\r\nand destroy his cities; should any pillage the property of the god, or\r\nbe privy to or plan anything against what is in his temple, we will\r\ntake vengeance on him with hand and foot and voice and all our might.”\r\nThis is indeed the language rather of a Militant Church than a state;\r\nbut it is easily conceivable that, had these principles been carried\r\nout (which they were not), something nearer a central and sovereign\r\nparliament might have arisen.\r\n\r\n[97] Herodotus, vi. 7, 11-12.\r\n\r\n[98] See Herod. 9, 15; Thucyd. 2, 2; 4, 91; 5, 37; Xenophon _Hellen._\r\n3, 4, 4, Boeckh, _C.

Grote, vol. ix. p. 319.\r\n\r\n[102] Herod. 6, 49.\r\n\r\n[103] Polybius (12, 26 _c_.) says that in his time the schools were\r\ngenerally in disrepute. But is not this generally the verdict of\r\n“practical” men on universities? The excitement at Rome at the visit\r\nof the philosophers (B.C. 155) seems to show that they still enjoyed a\r\nworld-wide reputation.\r\n\r\n[104] Herod. 8, 73.\r\n\r\n[105] Thucy. 1, 103.\r\n\r\n[106] _Id._ 3, 94-98.\r\n\r\n[107] Xen. _Hellen._ 4, 6, 13, 14.\r\n\r\n[108] Pausan. 10, 38, 10.\r\n\r\n[109] Demosth. 3 _Phil._ 120.\r\n\r\n[110] Pausan. 1, 4, 4.\r\n\r\n[111] 18, 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[112] Herod. 1, 145. Instead of Rhypes and Aegae, the first of which\r\nseems to have been burnt, and the other to have for some reason been\r\ndeserted, Polybius (2, 41) mentions Leontium and Caryneia.\r\n\r\n[113] Thucyd. 1, 111, 115.\r\n\r\n[114] Thucyd. 4, 21.\r\n\r\n[115] 2, 38, 39.\r\n\r\n[116] 2, 39, 40.\r\n\r\n[117] Plutarch, _Arat._ ch. 9.\r\n\r\n[118] Plutarch, _Arat._ ch. 22.\r\n\r\n[119] Though this law was several times broken, certainly in the\r\ncase of Philopoemen, and probably in that of Aratus also. It is very\r\ndifficult to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement of Aratus’s seventeen\r\ngeneralships if the strict alternation is preserved. See Freeman’s\r\n_Federal Government_, p. 601.\r\n\r\n[120] 2, 46.\r\n\r\n[121] Plutarch, _Cleomenes_, 3-16.\r\n\r\n[122] Plutarch, _Cleom._ 3. Messenia had been free from the Spartans\r\nsince the battle of Leuctra (B.C. 371). Epaminondas had meant by\r\nthe foundation of Megalopolis and Messene (B.C. 371-370) to form a\r\nunited Messenian and Arcadian state as a counterpoise to Sparta. The\r\nMessenians had drifted away from this arrangement, but were now members\r\nof the Achaean league.

I. G._ 1124. The principal authorities for the history\r\nof the last hundred years of Greek Independence, including that of\r\nthe Achaean league, are Polybius, beginning with book 2, and in its\r\nturn going on throughout the rest of his work which remains; scattered\r\nnotices in Livy from 27, 29 to the end of his extant work, and the\r\nepitomes of the last books, mostly translated directly from Polybius;\r\nPlutarch’s Lives of Agis, Cleomenes, Aratus, Philopoemen, Flamininus,\r\nAemilius; Pausanias, 7, 6-16; parts of Diodorus; Justinus (epitome of\r\nTrogus); and some fragments of Greek historians collected by Müller.\r\n\r\n[135] I speak of course of the restored league after the election of\r\none Strategus began, B.C. 255.\r\n\r\n[136] For the change of time of the election see note on 5, 1.\r\n\r\n[137] We hear nothing of a secretary under the new league after the\r\nabolition of the dual presidency. But he probably still existed (2, 43).\r\n\r\n[138] 10, 22.\r\n\r\n[139] See ch. 46.\r\n\r\n[140] This is certainly the meaning of the words of Polybius. But he\r\nhas confused matters. The two new Consuls designated at the comitia\r\nof 249 were C. Aurelius Cotta II and P. Servilius Geminus II, whereas\r\nLucius Junius Pullus was the existing Consul with the disgraced P.\r\nClaudius Pulcher. What really happened is made clear by Livy, Ep. 19.\r\nThe Senate sent Junius with these supplies, recalled Claudius, and\r\nforced him to name a Dictator. Claudius retaliated by naming an obscure\r\nperson, who was compelled to abdicate, and then Atilius Calatinus was\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\n[141] The dangerous nature of the S. Coast of Sicily was well known to\r\nthe pilots. See above, ch. 37.\r\n\r\n[142] About £500,000. For the value of the talent, taking the Euboic\r\nand Attic talent as the same, see note on Book 34, 8.\r\n\r\n[143] ἱστορήσαντας. There seems no need to give this word the unusual\r\nsense of _narratum legere_ here, as some do.\r\n\r\n[144] Sicca Venerea, so called from a temple of Venus, was notorious\r\nfor its licentiousness. Valer. Max. 2, 6, 15.\r\n\r\n[145] A line of the text appears to have been lost, probably containing\r\nan allusion to Hiero.\r\n\r\n[146] The southernmost point of Italy is Leucopetra (Capo dell' Armi).\r\nCocinthus (Punta di Stilo) is much too far to the north; yet it may\r\nhave been regarded as the conventional point of separation between\r\nthe two seas, Sicilian and Ionian, which have no natural line of\r\ndemarcation.\r\n\r\n[147] Really 3/16; for 16 ases = 6 obols (one drachma or denarius) see\r\n34, 8. The Sicilian medimnus is about a bushel and a half; the metretes\r\n8½ gallons.\r\n\r\n[148] Livy, 5, 17, 33-49; Plutarch, _Camillus_, 16; Mommsen, _History\r\nof Rome_, vol. i. p. 338 (Eng. tr.)\r\n\r\n[149] Compare the description of the Gauls given by Caesar, B.G. 6,\r\n11-20. They had apparently made considerable progress in civilisation\r\nby that time, principally perhaps from the influence of Druidism.\r\nBut the last characteristic mentioned by Polybius is also observed\r\nby Caesar (15), _omnes in bello versantur atque eorum ut quisque\r\nest genere copiisque amplissimus, ita plurimos circum se ambactos\r\nclienteeque habet. Hanc unam gratiam potentiamque habent._ Even in the\r\ntime of Cato they were at least beginning to add something to their\r\nwarlike propensities. Or, 2, 2 (Jordan) _Pleraque Gallia duas res\r\nindustrissime persequitur, rem militare et argute loqui_. Cf. Diod. 5,\r\n27 _sq._\r\n\r\n[150] Lucius Caecilius, Livy, Ep. 12.\r\n\r\n[151] For a more complete list of Gallic invasions in this period, see\r\nMommsen, _H.R._ i. p. 344. The scantiness of continuous Roman history\r\nfrom B.C. 390, and its total loss from 293 to the first Punic war\r\nrenders it difficult to determine exactly which of the many movements\r\nPolybius has selected.\r\n\r\n[152] Ch. 13.\r\n\r\n[153] This clause is bracketed by Hultsch, Mommsen, and\r\nStrachan-Davidson. See the essay of the last named in his Polybius, p.\r\n22. Livy, Ep. 20, gives the number of Romans and Latins as 300,000.\r\n\r\n[154] Others read Ananes and Marseilles [’Ανάνων ... Μασσαλίας]; but it\r\nseems impossible that the Roman march should have extended so far.\r\n\r\n[155] That is, each city struck its own coin, but on a common standard\r\nof weight and value. See P. Gardner’s Introduction to Catalogue of\r\nGreek Coins (Peloponnesus) in the British Museum, p. xxiv.\r\n\r\n[156] The Pythagorean clubs, beginning in combinations for the\r\ncultivation of mystic philosophy and ascetic life, had grown to be\r\npolitical,— a combination of the upper or cultivated classes to secure\r\npolitical power. Thus Archytas was for many years ruler in Tarentum\r\n(Strabo, 1, 3, 4). The earliest was at Croton, but they were also\r\nestablished in many cities of Magna Graecia. Sometime in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. a general democratic rising took place against them, and\r\ntheir members were driven into exile. Strabo, 8, 7, 1; Justin, 20, 4;\r\nIamblichus _vit. Pythag._, 240-262.\r\n\r\n[157] The MS. vary between ὁμάριος and ὁμόριος. The latter form seems\r\nto mean “god of a common frontier.” But an inscription found at\r\nOrchomenus gives the form ἀμάριος, which has been connected with ἡμάρα\r\n“day.”\r\n\r\n[158] There was still an under-strategus (ὑποστρατηγὸς), see 5, 94; 23,\r\n16; 30, 11. But he was entirely subordinate, and did not even succeed\r\nto power on the death of a strategus during the year of office, as the\r\nvice-president in America does.\r\n\r\n[159] Alexander II. of Epirus, son of Pyrrhus, whom he succeeded B.C.\r\n272. The partition of Acarnania took place in B.C. 266.\r\n\r\n[160] Near Bellina, a town on the north-west frontier of Laconia, which\r\nhad long been a subject of dispute between Sparta and the Achaeans.\r\nPlutarch _Arat._ 4; Pausan. 8, 35, 4.\r\n\r\n[161] Ptolemy Euergetes (B.C. 247-222).\r\n\r\n[162] The treaty, besides securing the surrender of the Acrocorinthus,\r\nprovided that no embassy should be sent to any other king without the\r\nconsent of Antigonus, and that the Achaeans should supply food and pay\r\nfor the Macedonian army of relief. Solemn sacrifices and games were\r\nalso established in his honour, and kept up long after his death at\r\nSicyon, see 28, 19; 30, 23. Plutarch, _Arat._ 45. The conduct of Aratus\r\nin thus bringing the Macedonians into the Peloponnese has been always\r\nattacked (see Plut. _Cleom._ 16). It is enough here to say that our\r\njudgment as to it must depend greatly on our view of the designs and\r\ncharacter of Cleomenes.\r\n\r\n[163] Phylarchus, said by some to be a native of Athens, by others of\r\nNaucratis, and by others again of Sicyon, wrote, among other things,\r\na history in twenty-eight books from the expedition of Pyrrhus into\r\nthe Peloponnese (B.C. 272) to the death of Cleomenes. He was a fervent\r\nadmirer of Cleomenes, and therefore probably wrote in a partisan\r\nspirit; yet in the matter of the outrage upon Mantinea, Polybius\r\nhimself is not free from the same charge. See Mueller’s _Histor.\r\nGraec._ fr. lxxvii.-lxxxi. Plutarch, though admitting Phylarchus’s\r\ntendency to exaggeration (_Arat._ 38), yet uses his authority both in\r\nhis life of Aratus and of Cleomenes; and in the case of Aristomachus\r\nsays that he was both racked and drowned (_Arat._ 44).\r\n\r\n[164] ἡγεμόνα καὶ στρατηγὸν. It is not quite clear whether this is\r\nmerely a description of the ordinary office of Strategus, or whether\r\nany special office is meant, such as that conferred on Antigonus. In\r\n4, 11 ἡγεμόνες includes the Strategus and other officers. See Freeman,\r\n_Federal Government_, p. 299.\r\n\r\n[165] Of Chaereas nothing seems known; a few fragments of an historian\r\nof his name are given in Müller, vol. iii. Of Sosilus, Diodorus (26,\r\nfr. 6) says that he was of Ilium and wrote a history of Hannibal in\r\nseven books. Nepos (Hann. 13) calls him a Lacedaemonian, and says that\r\nhe lived in Hannibal’s camp and taught him Greek.\r\n\r\n[166] _i.e._ in Latium.\r\n\r\n[167] ἐπιλάβηται _injecerit manum_, the legal form of claiming a slave.\r\n\r\n[168] 1, 83.\r\n\r\n[169] Saguntum of course is south of the Iber, but the attack on it\r\nby Hannibal was a breach of the former of the two treaties. Livy (21,\r\n2) seems to assert that it was specially exempted from attack in the\r\ntreaty with Hasdrubal.\r\n\r\n[170] From ch. 21.\r\n\r\n[171] βασιλεύς. The two Suffetes represented the original Kings of\r\nCarthage (6, 51). The title apparently remained for sacrificial\r\npurposes, like the ἄρχων βασιλεύς, and the _rex sacrificulus_.\r\nPolybius, like other Greek writers, calls them βασιλεῖς. _Infra_, 42.\r\nHerod. 7, 165. Aristot. Pol. 2, 8.\r\n\r\n[172] A promontory in Bruttium, _Capo del Colonne_.\r\n\r\n[173] This division of the world into three parts was an advance upon\r\nthe ancient geographers, who divided it into two, combining Egypt with\r\nAsia, and Africa with Europe. See Sall. _Jug._ 17; Lucan, _Phars._ 9,\r\n411; Varro de L. L. 5, § 31. And note on 12, 25.\r\n\r\n[174] The _arae Philaenorum_ were apparently set up as boundary stones\r\nto mark the territory of the Pentapolis or Cyrene from Egypt: and the\r\nplace retained the name long after the disappearance of the altars\r\n(Strabo, 3, 5, 5-6).\r\n\r\n[175] For Polybius’s calculation as to the length of the stade, see\r\nnote on 34, 12.\r\n\r\n[176] Livy, 21, 25, calls it _Tannetum_, and describes it only as\r\n_vicus Pado propinquus_. It was a few miles from Parma.\r\n\r\n[177] _Pluribus enim divisus amnis in mare decurrit_ (Livy, 21, 26).\r\n\r\n[178] See on ch. 33, note 2.\r\n\r\n[179] This statement has done much to ruin Polybius’s credit as a\r\ngeographer. It indicates indeed a strangely defective conception of\r\ndistance; as his idea, of the Rhone flowing always west, does of the\r\ngeneral lie of the country.\r\n\r\n[180] I have no intention of rediscussing the famous question of the\r\npass by which Hannibal crossed the Alps. The reader will find an\r\nadmirably clear statement of the various views entertained, and the\r\nlatest arguments advanced in favour of each, in the notes to Mr. W. T.\r\nArnold’s edition of Dr. Arnold’s _History of the Second Punic War_, pp.\r\n362-373.\r\n\r\n[181] περί τι λευκόπετρον, which, however, perhaps only means “bare\r\nrock,” cf. 10, 30. But see Law’s _Alps of Hannibal_, vol. i. p. 201\r\n_sq._\r\n\r\n[182] His life according to one story, was saved by his son, the famous\r\nScipio Africanus (10, 3); according to another, by a Ligurian slave\r\n(Livy, 21, 46).\r\n\r\n[183] Livy says “to Mago,” Hannibal’s younger brother (21, 47). This\r\nHasdrubal is called in ch. 93 “captain of pioneers.”\r\n\r\n[184] That is, four legions and their regular contingent of socii. See\r\n6, 19 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[185] “He crossed the Apennines, not by the ordinary road to Lucca,\r\ndescending the valley of the Macra, but, as it appears, by a straighter\r\nline down the valley of the Auser or Serchio.”—ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n[186] The marshes between the Arno and the Apennines south of Florence.\r\n\r\n[187] ἀπεκοιμῶντο Schw. translates simply _dormiebant_. But the\r\ncompound means more than that; it conveys the idea of an interval of\r\nsleep snatched from other employments. See Herod. 8, 76; Aristoph.\r\n_Vesp._ 211.\r\n\r\n[188] Livy, 22, 4-6. For a discussion of the modern views as to the\r\nscene of the battle, see W. T. Arnold’s edition of Dr. Arnold’s\r\n_History of the Second Punic War_, pp. 384-393. The radical difference\r\nbetween the account of Livy and that of Polybius seems to be that the\r\nformer conceives the fighting to have been on the north shore of the\r\nlake between Tucro and Passignano; Polybius conceives the rear to have\r\nbeen caught in the defile of Passignano, the main fighting to have\r\nbeen more to the east, where the road turns up at right angles to the\r\nlake by La Torricella. Mr. Capes, however in his note on the passage\r\nof Livy, seems to think that both accounts agree in representing the\r\nfighting on the vanguard as being opposite Tucro.\r\n\r\n[189] This treatment of non-combatants was contrary to the usages of\r\ncivilised warfare even in those days, and seems to have been the true\r\nground for the charge of _crudelitas_ always attributed to Hannibal by\r\nRoman writers, as opposed to the behaviour of such an enemy as Pyrrhus\r\n(Cic. _de Am._ 28). It may be compared to the order of the Convention\r\nto give no quarter to English soldiers, which the French officers nobly\r\nrefused to execute.\r\n\r\n[190] Polybius expresses the fact accurately, for, in the absence of\r\na Consul to nominate a Dictator, Fabius was created by a plebiscitum;\r\nbut the scruples of the lawyers were quieted by his having the title of\r\n_prodictator_ only (Livy, 22, 8).\r\n\r\n[191] Ramsay (_Roman Antiquities_, p. 148) denies this exception,\r\nquoting Livy, 6, 16. But Polybius could hardly have been mistaken on\r\nsuch a point; and there are indications (Plutarch, _Anton._ 9) that\r\nthe Tribunes did not occupy the same position as the other magistrates\r\ntowards the Dictator.\r\n\r\n[192] The _ager Praetutianus_ was the southern district of Picenum\r\n(Livy, 22, 9; 27, 43). The chief town was Interamna.\r\n\r\n[193] On the Appian Way between Equus Tuticus and Herdonia, mod.\r\n_Troja_.\r\n\r\n[194] Holsten for the Δαύνιοι of the old text; others suggest _Calatia_.\r\n\r\n[195] Added by conjecture of Schw.

The ordinary word for “forming line”\r\nor “taking dressing” is παρεμβάλλειν. In the other two passages where\r\nἐπιπαρεμβάλλειν is used, ἐπί has a distinct (though different) force. I\r\nthink here it must mean “against,” “so as to attack.” And this seems to\r\nbe Casaubon’s interpretation.\r\n\r\n[200] There is nothing here absolutely to contradict the picturesque\r\nstory of the death of Paulus given by Livy (22, 49), but the words\r\ncertainly suggest that Polybius had never heard it.\r\n\r\n[201] A town on the lake of Trichonis, in Aetolia, but its exact\r\nsituation is uncertain. Strabo (10, 2, 3) says that it was on a fertile\r\nplain, which answers best to a situation north of the lake.\r\n\r\n[202] Cf. 9, 34. We know nothing of this incident.\r\n\r\n[203] See 2, 53.\r\n\r\n[204] The Achaean Strategus was elected in the middle of May, the\r\nAetolian in the autumn. Aratus would be elected May 12, B.C. 220, and\r\ncome into office some time before midsummer; Ariston’s Aetolian office\r\nwould terminate in September B.C. 220. See v. 1.\r\n\r\n[205] The capture of Sicyon and expulsion of the tyrant Nicocles was\r\nthe earliest exploit of Aratus, B.C. 251. Plutarch, _Arat._ 4-9. The\r\ntaking of the Acrocorinthus from the Macedonian garrison was in B.C.\r\n243, _ib._ ch. 19-24. For the affair at Pellene see _ib._ 31. The\r\ncapture of Mantinea was immediately after a defeat by Cleomenes. See\r\nPlutarch, _Cleom._ 5.\r\n\r\n[206] The city of Pheia was on the isthmus connecting the promontory\r\nIchthys (_Cape Katákolo_) with the mainland: opposite its harbour is\r\na small island which Polybius here calls _Pheias_, _i.e._ the island\r\nbelonging to Pheia.\r\n\r\n[207] Caphyae was on a small plain, which was subject to inundations\r\nfrom the lake of Orchomenus; the ditches here mentioned appear to be\r\nthose dug to drain this district. They were in the time of Pausanias\r\nsuperseded by a high dyke, from the inner side of which ran the River\r\nTragus (_Tara_).

The story told by Pausanias, who also quotes these verses, is\r\nthat Aristocrates, king of the Arcadians, twice played the traitor to\r\nAristomenes, the Messenian champion: once at the battle of the Great\r\nTrench, and again when Aristomenes renewed the war after his escape\r\nfrom the Pits at Sparta; and that on the second occasion his own people\r\nstoned him to death, and set up this pillar in the sacred enclosure of\r\nZeus on Mount Lycaeus.\r\n\r\n[219] But Pausanias represents the pillar as put up by the Arcadians,\r\nnot the Messenians (4, 22, 7).\r\n\r\n[220] The text is uncertain here.\r\n\r\n[221] Reading with Hultsch, τὰ καλὰ.\r\n\r\n[222] However cogent may be the reasons for his prophecy adduced by\r\nPolybius, there are no signs of its being fulfilled. Indeed, the bank\r\nat the mouth of the Danube, which he mentions, has long disappeared.\r\nThe fact seems to be that he failed to take into calculation the\r\nconstant rush of water out of the Euxine, which is sufficient to carry\r\noff any amount of alluvial deposit.\r\n\r\n[223] Xenophon, _Hellen._ 1, 1, 22.\r\n\r\n[224] Or Tylis, according to Stephanos Byz., who says it was near the\r\nHaemus.

The title seems to have been brought from the\r\nmother-city Megara; as at Chalcedon, another colony of Megara, the same\r\nexisted (C. I. G. 3794). It was connected with the worship of Apollo\r\nbrought from Megara, Müller’s _Dorians_, i. p. 250. It seems that this\r\nuse of the name (generally employed of the deputies to the Amphictyonic\r\ncouncil) was peculiarly Dorian. See Boeckh. C. I., vol. i. p. 610.\r\n\r\n[228] Or Lyctos (Steph.

The\r\nprepared hair was for making ropes and bowstrings apparently.\r\n\r\n[232] Gortyna or Gortys is an emendation of Reiske for Gorgus, which is\r\nnot known. Gortys is mentioned by Pausanias, 5, 7, 1; 8, 27, 4; 8, 28,\r\n1; it was on the river Bouphagus, and in the time of Pausanias was a\r\nmere village.\r\n\r\n[233] See 2, 41. We have no hint, as far as I know, of the\r\ncircumstances under which such recovery would take place. We may\r\nconjecture from this passage that it would be on showing that losses\r\nhad been sustained by reason of a failure of the league to give\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n[234] Stephanos describes Ambracus as a πολιχνίον close to Ambracia.\r\n\r\n[235] Though it was in the territory of Acarnania (Steph. Byz.)\r\n\r\n[236] 3, 19.\r\n\r\n[237] The position of Dodona, long a subject of doubt, was settled by\r\nthe discovery of the numerous inscriptions found about seven miles from\r\nJannina, and published by Constantine Caraponos in 1878, _Dodon et ses\r\nRuines_. See also _Journal of Hellenic Studies_, vol. i. p. 228.\r\n\r\n[238] See ch. 68.\r\n\r\n[239] Reading ἁλίαν. See Müller’s _Dorians_, vol. II, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[240] The local name of Tarentine, though doubtless originating in\r\nfact, had come to indicate a species of mercenary cavalry armed in a\r\nparticular way. Arrian, _Tact._ 4, distinguishes two sorts of light\r\ncavalry for skirmishing Tarentines armed with javelins (δορατία), and\r\nhorse archers (ἱπποτοξόται). Cp, 11, 12. Livy 35, 29; 37, 40.\r\n\r\n[241] Pausanias (8, 26, 7) calls him Hypatodorus; and mentions another\r\nwork of his at Delphi (10, 10, 3). He flourished about B.C. 370. He\r\nwas a native of Thebes. Sostratos was a Chian, and father of another\r\nstatuary named Pantias. Paus. 6, 9, 3.\r\n\r\n[242] That is the office of the Polemarch, as in Athens the Strategium\r\n(στρατηγίον) is the office of the Strategi. Plutarch, _Nicias_, 5.\r\n\r\n[243] Yet the avowed project of Cleomenes was the restoration of the\r\nancient constitution. Plutarch, _Cleom._ c. 10.\r\n\r\n[244] See ch. 59.\r\n\r\n[245] From 4, 6, it appears that the election took place at the rising\r\nof the Pleiades (13th May) and that the new Strategus did not enter\r\nupon his office until some time afterwards, towards the middle of June\r\nor even midsummer. But the custom apparently varied, and the use of\r\nτότε seems to indicate a change.\r\n\r\n[246] Later on the assemblies were held at the different cities in\r\nturn. See 23, 17; 24, 10, etc.\r\n\r\n[247] Νεοκρῆτες, cf. cc. 65, 79. Livy (37, 40) transcribes the word\r\n_Neocretes_. It is uncertain what the exact meaning of the word is. It\r\nseems most reasonable to suppose that, like Tarentini, it had ceased\r\nto be an ethnical term, and meant mercenary soldiers (νέοι) armed like\r\nCretans, that is, as archers.\r\n\r\n[248] The narrow channel between Leucas and the mainland, which had\r\nbeen artificially enlarged. Dionys Halic. 1, 50.\r\n\r\n[249] 4, 63.\r\n\r\n[250] 4, 62.\r\n\r\n[251] 4, 67.\r\n\r\n[252] The pun disappears in translation. The line is\r\n\r\n   ὁρᾷς τὸ +δῖον+ οὗ βέλος δίεπτατο.\r\n\r\n[253] Games in his honour were celebrated at Sicyon. See Plutarch,\r\n_Arat._ 45. _Cleomenes_, 16. _Supra_, p. 147 n. _Infra_, 28, 19; 30, 23.\r\n\r\n[254] A memorial, apparently, of the fruitless expedition of Pyrrhus\r\ninto Laconia in B.C. 272.\r\n\r\n[255] The Guard. The word _agema_ properly means the leading corps in\r\nan army; but it obtained this technical meaning in the Macedonian army\r\n(see Arrian, 1, 1, 11), whence it was used in other armies also founded\r\non the Macedonian model, as for instance in Alexandria (see _infra_,\r\nch. 65).\r\n\r\n[256] Hypaspists, originally a bodyguard to the king, had been extended\r\nin number and formed one or more distinct corps of light infantry\r\n(Grote, ch. 92).\r\n\r\n[257] Here again, as in 5, 1, the outgoing Strategus appears to go out\r\nof office at the time of the election of his successor (see note on ch.\r\n1, and cp. 4, 6). There seems to have been some variety of practice.\r\nPerhaps the interval was left somewhat to mutual arrangement, the\r\nsummer solstice being the outside limit.\r\n\r\n[258] See 2, 69.\r\n\r\n[259] Archidamus was the brother of Agis, the king of the other line,\r\nwho had been assassinated in B.C. 240. Plutarch, _Cleom._ 5, probably\r\non the authority of Phylarchus, represents the murder of Archidamus as\r\nnot the work of Cleomenes, but of the same party that had murdered Agis\r\nand feared the vengeance of his brother. (See Thirlwall, 8, p. 158, who\r\nagrees with Plutarch.)\r\n\r\n[260] Homer, _Il._, 22, 304.\r\n\r\n[261] The false Smerdis (Herod. 3, 61-82).\r\n\r\n[262] Hence the sacred breed of Nisaean horses, used for the Persian\r\nking’s chariot (Herod 7, 40; 9, 20). The Nisaean plain was one of those\r\nin Media containing the best pasture, and is identified by Rawlinson\r\nwith that of _Khawar_ and _Alistan_ near _Behistun_.\r\n\r\n[263] ἕταιροι are cavalry; the πεζέταιροι of the Macedonian army are\r\nrepresented in Polybius by the Hypaspists. See _supra_, ch. 27, cp. 16,\r\n18.\r\n\r\n[264] That is, Demetrius II. and Antigonus Doson.\r\n\r\n[265] See Professor Mahaffy, _Greek Life and Thought_, p. 405, who\r\npoints out that this refers to the Egyptian troops especially, whose\r\nold military castes (see Herod. 2, 164-6) though not extinct had\r\nforgotten their old skill. In a sense, however, it applies to both\r\nkinds of troops; for they had to be trained to act _together_, as is\r\nshown in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[266] See above, ch. 5 note.\r\n\r\n[267] Two different towns of this name have already been mentioned (ch.\r\n48, 52). This Dura appears to be in Phoenicia; but nothing is known of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[268] Seleucus I., B.C. 306-280.

See note on 5, 25.\r\n\r\n[276] Sarissae, the long Macedonian spears.\r\n\r\n[277] Polybius therefore reckons the value of the λέβητες and ὑδρίαι as\r\nfive talents.\r\n\r\n[278] That is about 171,000 lbs., see 34, 8, note, reckoning the talent\r\nas = 57 lbs.\r\n\r\n[279] ἀρτάβη, an Egyptian measure = the Attic medimnus.\r\n\r\n[280] Callinicus, ob. B.C. 226. This must refer to another case.\r\n\r\n[281] See _ante_, ch. 30. Agetas had been elected Aetolian Strategus in\r\nthe autumn of 218 B.C., Aratus Achaean Strategus in the early summer of\r\nB.C. 217.\r\n\r\n[282] See 2, 61-4. B.C. 222.\r\n\r\n[283] See 2, 39.\r\n\r\n[284] See _supra_, ch. 24.\r\n\r\n[285] According to Suidas, these were light vessels used by pirates:\r\nbut whether the name arose from their construction, capacity, or the\r\nnumber of their oars, seems uncertain. According to Hesychius they had\r\ntwo banks of oars (δίκροτος ναῦς· πλοῖον μικρόν).\r\n\r\n[286] See ch. 95.\r\n\r\n[287] This language is so vague that we might suppose from it that\r\nthe Achaeans elected Timoxenus in the summer of B.C. 217 to come\r\ninto office in the following spring. But there is nowhere else any\r\nindication of such an interval at this period, and we must suppose\r\nPolybius to be speaking in general terms of the result of the peace\r\nduring the next ten months. Agelaus was elected Aetolian Strategus in\r\nthe autumn of B.C. 217.\r\n\r\n[288] Euripides, fr. 529. Ed. Nauck.\r\n\r\n[289] Some disconnected fragments which are usually placed at the end\r\nof the first chapter, and form the second chapter of this book, I have\r\nplaced among the minor fragments at the end of these volumes.\r\n\r\n[290] Aristotle’s classification is kingship, aristocracy, πολιτεία,\r\ndemocracy, oligarchy, tyranny (Pol. 4, 2). This was derived from Plato\r\n(Pol. 302, c.) who arranges the six (besides the ideal polity) in\r\npairs, kingship, tyranny,—aristocracy, oligarchy,—democracy, good and\r\nbad. Plato has no distinct name except δημοκρατία παράνομος, for the\r\nbad democracy which Polybius calls ὀχλοκρατία, “mob-rule.” Polybius’s\r\narrangement is this—\r\n\r\n   Kingship (arising from a natural despotism or monarchy)\r\n     degenerates into                                          Tyranny.\r\n\r\n   Aristocracy degenerates into                              Oligarchy.\r\n\r\n   Democracy   degenerates into                               Mob-rule.\r\n\r\n[291] εὐθύνας. Polybius uses a word well known at Athens and other\r\nGreek states, but the audit of a Consul seems to have been one of money\r\naccounts only. At the expiration, however, of his office he took an\r\noath in public that he had obeyed the laws, and if any prosecution were\r\nbrought against him it would be tried before the people. See the case\r\nof Publius Claudius, 1, 52.\r\n\r\n[292] This refers primarily to the _consilium_ of the _quaesitor_ in\r\nany special _quaestio_, which up to the time of the lex judiciaria of\r\nGracchus, B.C. 122, was invariably composed of Senators. The same would\r\napply to the _Quaestiones perpetuae_, only one of which existed in the\r\ntime of Polybius, i.e., _de repetundis_, established in 149 B.C. by the\r\nlex Calpurnia. Other single judices in civil suits, though nominated by\r\nthe Praetor, were, Polybius intimates, almost necessarily Senators in\r\ncases of importance.\r\n\r\n[293] Casaubon altered this to “two hundred.” In 3, 107, Polybius\r\ncertainly states that the ordinary number of cavalry was 200, raised\r\nin cases of emergency to 300, and Livy, 22, 36, gives an instance. But\r\nboth authors in many other passages mention 300 as the usual number,\r\nand any alteration of this passage would be unsafe.\r\n\r\n[294] _Praefectus sociis_ and _quaestor_. But this quaestor must be\r\ndistinguished from the Roman quaestors.\r\n\r\n[295] For the Spanish sword see Fr. xxii.\r\n\r\n[296] Polybius does not mention the subdivision of maniples into\r\ncenturies, for which the word ordines is sometimes used. Livy, 8, 8;\r\n42, 34.\r\n\r\n[297] The plethrum = 10,000 square feet. The side of the square of the\r\nPraetorium, therefore, is 200 feet.\r\n\r\n[298] That is the _via_ separating it from the next block, or from the\r\nvallum.\r\n\r\n[299] That is, one between the two legions, and two between the blocks\r\nin each.\r\n\r\n[300] That is to say—without the _extraordinarii_ (⅕)—there are 2400 to\r\nget into 10 spaces instead of 3000 into 30.\r\n\r\n[301] That is, who have been selected from the pedites sociorum to\r\nserve on the praetoria cohors.\r\n\r\n[302] Polybius always calls this the χάραξ or χαράκωμα. But the Romans\r\nhad two words, _agger_ the embankment, and _vallum_ the palisading on\r\nthe top of it. Either word, however, is often used to represent the\r\nwhole structure.\r\n\r\n[303] That is, whether in first, second, or other watch in the night.\r\n\r\n[304] See the story of Cato’s son, Plutarch, _Cato Maj._ 20.\r\n\r\n[305] In seeking a constitution to compare with that of Rome, that of\r\nAthens is rejected (1) as not being a mixed one, (2) as not having been\r\nsuccessful: successful, that is, in gaining or keeping an empire. He is\r\nspeaking somewhat loosely. The power of Athens, of which Themistocles\r\nlaid the foundation, was mainly consolidated by Pericles; so that\r\nPolybius includes much of the period of her rise with that of her\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\n[306] For what remains of the account of Ephorus see Strabo, 10, 4,\r\n8-9. The reference to Plato is to the “Laws,” especially Book I.\r\nSee also Aristotle, _Pol._ 2, 10, who points out the likeness and\r\nunlikeness between the Cretan and Lacedaemonian constitutions.\r\n\r\n[307] This equality of land had gradually disappeared by the time of\r\nKing Agis IV. (B.C. 243-239): so that, according to Plutarch [_Agis_\r\n5], the number of landowners was reduced to 100. This process had been\r\naccelerated by the Rhetra of Epitadeus, allowing free bequest of land,\r\nPlutarch, _ib._ See Thirlwall, vol. viii. p. 132.\r\n\r\n[308] The meaning of νενεμημένους, which I here represent by “acquired\r\na recognised position,” is at least doubtful. Casaubon translates it\r\n_qui in album non fuerint recepti_, referring to Sueton. Nero, 21. But\r\nnothing is elsewhere known of such an _album_ for registering the names\r\nof recognised athletes. The passage is important as helping to explain\r\nhow the number of those entering for the contests in the greater games\r\nwas practically limited, and therefore how it happened that, for\r\ninstance, the five contests of the Pentathlum did not often fall to\r\ndifferent athletes so as to leave the victory uncertain.\r\n\r\n[309] The Carthaginian Suffetes are always called βασιλεῖς by the\r\nGreek writers: see 3, 33, note; Herod. 7, 165; Diod. Sic. 14, 53.\r\nAristotle [_Pol._ 2, 11], in contrasting the Spartan and Carthaginian\r\nconstitutions, mentions with approval that, unlike the Spartan kings,\r\nthose at Carthage were elected, and were not confined to a particular\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[310] See Bosworth Smith, _Carthage and the Carthaginians_, p. 26 ff.\r\n\r\n[311] This seems to be the only authority for assigning to the censors\r\nthe _toga purpurea_ instead of the _toga praetexta_: and, indeed,\r\nAthenaeus speaks of them as wearing the toga praetexta περιπόρφυρος,\r\n14, 69. In Livy, 40, 45, they occupy _sellae curules_.\r\n\r\n[312] Livy (2, 10) makes Cocles succeed in reaching the bank alive.\r\n\r\n[313] But Polybius afterwards admits that a falling off in this respect\r\nhad begun. See 18, 35; 32, 11.\r\n\r\n[314] Livy, 22, 58-61.\r\n\r\n[315] κακοὶ κακῶς, a phrase at once insulting and vulgar.\r\n\r\n[316] Plutarch, _Aratus_, ch. 48.\r\n\r\n[317] βαλανάγρας. The βαλανάγρα was a straight piece of wood with\r\nupright pins corresponding with those that fall into the bolt (the\r\nβάλανοι), and which are pushed up by it. It was thus used as a key\r\nwhich could be taken out and kept by the Commandant, as in Herod. 3,\r\n155; Thucyd. 2, 4. But Polybius here seems to use it as equivalent to\r\nβάλανος. See Aeneas, _Tact._ 18-20, who recommends that the μόχλος\r\nshould be sheeted with iron to prevent this very operation. Cp. 4, 57.\r\nWhat he means by ζύγωμα on the outside (here translated “fastenings”)\r\nis also somewhat doubtful. From Hesychius, s.v. ἐπιξευκτήρ, it might be\r\nconjectured that chains of some kind were intended. Casaubon supposed\r\nit to be a cross bar similar to the μόχλος inside, and Schw. to\r\nrepresent the posts and the lintel connecting them.\r\n\r\n[318] See 5, 37. According to Phylarchus the murder of Archidamus was\r\nagainst the wish of Cleomenes. Plut. _Cleom._ 5.\r\n\r\n[319] To which proceedings may be referred a sentence of Polybius\r\npreserved by Suidas, s.v. διεσκευασμένην—“They send out certain\r\nCretans, as though on a raid, giving them a sham despatch to carry.”\r\nSee Livy, 24, 30-31.\r\n\r\n[320] Cp. 1, 35.\r\n\r\n[321] σκορπίδια, mentioned among a number of similar engines in 1\r\nMacc. 6, 51. Plutarch calls them σκορπίοι, and explains that they only\r\ncarried a short distance, but, being concealed, gave wounds at close\r\nquarters; hence, doubtless, their name.\r\n\r\n[322] See also Athenaeus, 4, 166-167. Theopompus of Chius was a\r\ncontemporary of Philip II. and Alexander, having been born about B.C.\r\n376-372.\r\n\r\n[323] The accusation of administering slow poisons is a very common\r\none, as readers of mediæval history know. But the ignorance of the\r\nconditions of health was too great to allow us to accept them without\r\nquestion. It is doubtful whether drugs, acting in this particular way,\r\nwere known to the ancients; and certainly spitting blood would be no\r\nconclusive evidence of the presence of poison. See Creighton’s _History\r\nof the Papacy_, vol. iv. Append.\r\n\r\n[324] This fragment is supposed, by comparison with Livy, 25, 36, to\r\nbelong to the account of the fall of Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio in Spain,\r\nB.C. 212.\r\n\r\n[325] Or “legion,” according to others. But as both Consuls are engaged\r\nin the business, it seems reasonable to refer it to the two consular\r\narmies of two legions each.\r\n\r\n[326] That is “blaming Fortune or Providence.” Schw. quotes Xenophon\r\n_Hellen._ 7, 5, 12, ἔξεστι μὲν τὸ θεῖον αἰτιᾶσθαι.\r\n\r\n[327] συμπέμψαι, a difficult word. See Strachan-Davidson’s note. It\r\nseems to me to be opposed to φυγεῖν or some such idea. Hannibal was\r\nnot in flight, but kept the enemy with him, as it were, in a kind of\r\nprocession, until the moment for striking.\r\n\r\n[328] There is some word wanting in the text here which has been\r\nvariously supplied. I have ventured to conjecture =τὰ γὰρ δοκοῦντα=\r\nπαράβολον κ.τ.λ., and to translate accordingly: for it is the boldness\r\nand apparent rashness of Hannibal’s movement that Polybius seems to\r\nwish to commend.\r\n\r\n[329] Cp. Homer, _Odyss._ 19, 471.\r\n\r\n[330] Livy, 25, 40, calls him Mutines.\r\n\r\n[331] See 3, 86, note. Cp. Cicero de Am. § 8, cum duobus ducibus de\r\nimperio in Italia decertatum est, Pyrrho et Annibale. Ab altero propter\r\nprobitatem ejus non nimis alien os animos habemus; alterum _propter\r\ncrudelitatem semper haec civitas oderit_.\r\n\r\n[332] The paragraph “For the Aetolians ... in Greece,” follows “the\r\nMessenians” in ch. 30, in the Greek texts. But it is evidently out of\r\nplace there, and falls naturally into this position.\r\n\r\n[333] Antigonus Doson.\r\n\r\n[334] B.C. 211. See Livy, 26, 24-26.\r\n\r\n[335] On the margin of one MS. is written “For such is the\r\ncharacteristic always maintained by the Athenian State.” But its\r\nrelevancy is not very apparent; and at any rate it seems more likely to\r\nbe a comment of the Epitomator, than a sentence from Polybius.\r\n\r\n[336] Scopas (B.C. 211-210) must have gone out of office, _i.e._ it was\r\nafter autumn of 210 B.C.\r\n\r\n[337] That is, 10s. 3¾d. for about a bushel and a half. See on 2, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by_ R. & R. CLARK, _Edinburgh_",
